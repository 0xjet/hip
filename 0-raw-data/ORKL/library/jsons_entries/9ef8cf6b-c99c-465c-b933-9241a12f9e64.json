In 2008,\nRussia engaged in open warfare with Georgia. In 2014,\nRussia seized and annexed Crimea, followed by overall\nintervention in Ukraine[4]. In 2015, Russia deployed\nforces to Syria to aid the regime of Bashar al-Assad.\nThis was the first “out-of-area” military operation since\nindependence [5]. There has also been bold retaliation\ntowards uncooperative states, most recently involving\nthe expulsion of 755 US diplomats from their diplomatic\nposts in response to a US sanctions bill [6]. Russia has\n\n\nrepeatedly tested defences by sending aircraft into\nEuropean airspace, and most recently staged a Naval\ncelebration day that included Chinese warships as part\nof the demonstration. Russia desires to be seen as an\nalternative to the NATO-led West for other nations.\nRussia has used both economic and military power to\nexert pressure. Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom\nhas wielded influence over the politics and economics of\nmany European countries[7].\n\n### Internal security posture\n\nPutin’s leadership as President has seen marked\nefforts to increase internal surveillance and controls.\nThis has taken the form of new legislation to “weaken\nindependent civic actors… with selective prosecutions\naimed at intimidating society”, “discrediting foreign\n\n1.

Freedom\nHouse has given the country an aggregate “freedom\nscore” of 22 out of 100 [9]. Unpunished violence against\njournalists has contributed to violations against media\nfreedom. The “Yarovaya Law” has included new powers\nthat provide the state authorities with the ability to\nrepress religious groups for the purpose of fighting\nextremism [10]. Legal repercussions for expressing\nopinions online have also increased. As an example, in\n2016 Alexsei Kungurov was sentenced to two years in a\npenal colony for criticizing Russia’s actions in Syria[11].\n\n### Economy\n\nDespite a weak external environment, the Russian\neconomy was predicted to grow at a rate of\n1.3% in 2017[12]. During 2016, low oil prices\nand sanctions over Ukraine negatively\nimpacted the Russian economy before\nfinally taking a turn towards recovery at\nthe end of the year. Russia is one of the\nworld’s leading energy exporters, making\nthe fall in commodity price and high inflation\nparticularly tough on ordinary households[13].\nThe Financial Times reported that Russia’s\nclimb out of recession has brought the\nforecast for gross domestic product growth\nup to 1.5%. Putin has outlined an interest\nin building a “digital economy” in areas\nsuch as “big data, artificial intelligence and\nvirtual reality.”[14] A recent visit from the\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel to Russia\nhighlighted the importance of cooperation\nbetween the two countries in economic\nterms. Germany features as a major import\nand export partner for Russia. Despite the\ntopic of sanctions not being brought up,\nRussia is currently having to contend with\nthreats from the US around fresh sanctions.\nAlthough recovering, new sanctions could\n\n\n**GRU**\n\n**FSB**\n\n**SVR**\n\n\nfurther thwart the only recently recovering\nRussian economy.\n\n## National Cyber-Strategy\n\nAccording to the Centre for naval Analysis\n(CNA), Russian military theorists use the term\n“informatsionnaya voyna,” or information warfare, over\nthe popular use of “cyber” or “cyberwarfare”. The national\ndoctrine uses a broader understanding of information\nwarfare, which sits along other more traditional\nweapons such as “disinformation operations, PsyOps,\nelectronic warfare and political subversion”[15]. The\nSwedish Defence Agency reported in 2010 that “several\norganisations are responsible for handling information\nwarfare capabilities” whilst the FSB and the GRU are\nmost likely to be operating Russian\noffensive and defensive capabilities[16].\nThe FSB is believed to maintain and\noperate SORM, the states internal cyber\nsurveillance system[17].\n\n\nRussia’s most recent “National Security\nStrategy” does not use the term “cyber”\nat all. Instead, it uses phrases such\nas “information sphere,” “Information\nsecurity” and “information infrastructure”.\nThere are a number of entries pertaining\nto the recognition of information and\ncommunication technologies as a source\nof national security risk, as well as\ninferences as to the strengthening of\ncontrols. The 2015 “Military Doctrine of\nthe Russian Federation” highlighted the\nneed “to enhance capacity and means\nof information warfare” and recognised\nthat there are “subversive information\nactivities against the population,\nespecially young citizens of the State,\naimed at undermining historical, spiritual\nand patriotic traditions related to the\ndefense of the Motherland”[18].\n\n\n8. http://carnegieendowment.org/2017/05/18/delegitimization-and-division-in-russia-pub-69958\n9. https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2017/russia\n10. https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2017/russia\n11. https://pen.org/press-release/russian-blogger-sentenced-to-two-years-in-prison/\n12. http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/russia/overview#3\n13. https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/12/things-to-know-about-russia-s-economy/\n14. https://www.ft.com/content/206d3a7a-47b0-11e7-8519-9f94ee97d996\n15. www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=AD1019062\n16. http://www.highseclabs.com/data/foir2970.pdf\n17. www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=AD1019062\n18. https://rusemb.org.uk/press/2029\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)\n\n\nHead:\n\nMinister Responsible:\n\nParent Agency:\n\nHeadquarters:\n\nType of Service:\n\nAreas of Concern:\n\nAPT Groups:\n\nOther Groups:\n\n\nKorobov Igor Valentinovich\n\nSergey Shoygu, Defense Minister\n\nMinistry of Defence\n\n119160, Moscow (Ministry of Defence), Khodynka Airfield (GRU) “Aquarium”\n\nCentral intelligence agency of the Armed Forces\n\nMilitary; Military-political; Military-technical; Military-economic and Environmental spheres.[19]\n\nAPT28, also known as “Sofacy”, “STRONTIUM”, “Pawn Storm”, “Tsar Team” and “Fancy Bear”.\n(Although attribution for APT28 has been disputed between GRU and FSB, APT28 has largely\nbeen reported as originating from Russia’s military intelligence unit — GRU)[20].\n\nYemen Cyber Army, Cyber Berkut, Cyber Caliphate (Groups that have been purported to be a\nfront for the Russian GRU)[21,22].\n\n\n## The Federal Security Service (FSB)\n\n\nDirector:\n\nHeadquarters:\n\nType of Service:\n\nAreas of Concern:\n\nSubdivisions:\n\nAPT Groups:\n\n\nAlexander Vasilievich Bortnikov\n\nLubyanka Square, Moscow, Russia\n\nRussian internal security and counterintelligence service\n\nCounterterrorism; Border Security; Maritime Security, Economic and Resource Security;\nInformation Security\n\nPR; Department of material and Technical Support; Military Counterintelligence; Medical\nDirectorate; Antiterrorist Center; Investigations; Centre for Specialist Techniques;\nInternational Cooperation; Radio Intelligence; Operational and Technical Measures; FSB\nSecurity; Open information Department; Academy.[23]\n\nAPT29, also known as “Cozy Bear” has been previously attributed to the federal security\nservices (FSB)[24,25].\n\n\n## The Service of Foreign Intelligence (SVR)\n\n\nDirector:\n\nHeadquarters:\n\nType of Service:\n\nUnits:\nSubdivisions:\n\n\nNaryshkin Sergey Evgenievich\n\nYasenevo, Moscow, Russia\n\nThe Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation\n\nOperational; Analytical and Functional\n\nDirector’s Staff; Department of protocol; Academy; PR and Media; Operational; Office of\nAnalysis and Information; External Counterintelligence; Informatics; Scientific and Technological revolution, Management of Operators, Economic Intelligence, Support services.[26]\n\n\n19. http://structure.mil.ru/structure/ministry_of_defence/details.htm?id=9711@egOrganization\n20. https://www.crowdstrike.com/wp-content/brochures/FancyBearTracksUkrainianArtillery.pdf\n21. https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-trid-033017.pdf\n22. http://observer.com/2016/06/false-flags-the-kremlins-hidden-cyber-hand/\n23. www.fsb.ru/\n24. http://www.ecfr.eu/page/-/ECFR208_-_CRIMINTERM_-_HOW_RUSSIAN_ORGANISED_CRIME_OPERATES_IN_EUROPE02.pdf\n25. https://cyberx-labs.com/en/blog/dhsfbi-report-says-russian-cyber-units-attacked-critical-infrastructure-blackenergy/\n26. http://svr.gov.ru/index.htm\n\n\n-----\n\n## Russian-Based Organised Crime\n\nOrganised crime thrives in the right ecosystem. There\nis a growing body of evidence that Russian-based\norganised crime (RBOC) has links to the SVR, GRU and\nFSB. In the past, crime groups have been used as tools\nof the state to conduct intelligence activity[27]. Today,\nRBOC accounts for approximately a third of heroin in\nEurope, a large amount of human trafficking and illegal\nweapons imports. Political and business affiliations,\nused to facilitate the efficacy of organised crime, have\nlikely helped RBOC to grow. Belarus (for example), a\nkey Russian export/import partner, has a large spread\nof Russian community and business connections in local\npolitics[28]. The same approach has been seen between\ncyber-criminals and the state security services. Talent\nin the right skillsets has been notoriously difficult to\nacquire globally, but not when there is already a culture\nfor collaboration internally between underground actors\nand the state[29]. This approach enables Russia to conduct\noperations with plausible deniability. It is also worth\nnoting that Russian criminals have the benefit of both\nvirtual and physical safe-havens. Eastern European\ncountries and Russia do not have extradition treaties\nwith the West, and as long as the criminals do not\nattack Russian infrastructure they have largely been\nprotected[30].\n\n\nInterpol defines cybercrime into two different areas:\n\n- Advanced cybercrime (or high-tech crime)\n\n- Cyber-enabled crime\n\nTechnology and the dark web have been widely adopted\nby criminals to conduct activities. This is evidenced by\nthe large number of online markets selling access to\ndrugs, weapons and other illegal products and services.\nRussian carding sites follow this trend, providing access\nto sensitive financial information as well as sharing tools\nand tricks to help advance other would-be criminals\nrepertoire of abilities. This type of activity would be\ncategorised as cyber-enabled crime. On the other hand,\nsophisticated attacks, such as those linked to Carbanak\nGang and the FIN campaigns, fall under the category of\n“advanced cybercrime”. It is not difficult to draw linkages\nbetween traditional organised crime (their advancement\nin methodologies) and current trends in cybercrime.\nIt is therefore not surprising that such a potent region\nfor organised crime also has a hefty reputation for\nconducting cybercrime.\n\nThe US “most wanted” list contains a number of\nindividuals believed to be located in Russia or Ukraine[31]:\n\n\n**Name** **Crime** **Last seen/ Potential residence**\n\nIvan Viktorvich Klepikov Zeus Malware Russia, Ukraine\n\nAlexey Dmitrievich Bron Zeus Malware Russia, Ukraine\n\nVyacheslav Igorevich Penchukov Zeus Malware Russia, Ukraine\n\nEvgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev Zeus Malware Russia\n\nIgor Anatolyevich Sushchin (FSB Officer) Large scale intrusion Moscow, Russia\n\nDmitry Aleksandrovich Dokuchaev (FSB Officer) Large scale intrusion Moscow, Russia\n\nAlexsey Belan Large scale intrusion Krasnodar, Russia\n\n27. https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/06/06/russia_cyber_militia_analysis/\n28. http://www.ecfr.eu/page/-/ECFR208_-_CRIMINTERM_-_HOW_RUSSIAN_ORGANISED_CRIME_OPERATES_IN_EUROPE02.pdf\n29. https://bpr.berkeley.edu/2017/04/07/cybercrime-the-spark-which-started-russias-cyber-crusade/\n30. https://www.thecipherbrief.com/article/tech/crimicon-valley-russias-cybercrime-underground-1092\n31. https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber\n\n\n-----\n\n## Civil society and its discontents\n\nJust as RBOC can be used to “outsource” the mission\nobjectives of the state, so too can hacktivism be\nweaponised for motives that benefit the government.\nRussia is not alone in this thought process; protest\ngroups and activism have been carefully interfered with\nin the past by many states. The activity allows them\nto enhance an agenda or justify further actions. In the\n“information sphere” this has taken the guise of groups\nsuch as the “CyberCaliphate,” which hacked into TV5\nMonde in France[32], and “Tsar Team” (previously linked\nto apt28) leaking information about athletes’ medical\nhistories. The Ukrainian based “Cyber Berkut” has been a\nfeature of attacks against pro-European institutions and\nnational infrastructure during the conflict. The “Yemen\nCyber Army” (YCA) has also been accused of having been\ncreated by the same organisation behind APT28 (FSB)[33].\nInformation taken from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs (after being hacked by the YCA) was then published\non WikiLeaks.\n\nPsychological operations (PsyOps) and social media have\nalso played a role in influencing the “perceptions, attitudes\nand behaviours of target populations”. This can be done by\nspreading rumours, usually by exploiting already\n\n\nembedded dislikes and prejudices, fear and exploiting\nhopeful wishes for possible outcomes[34]. Russia has been\naccused of using this tactic via social media to influence\nthe outcomes of the US elections. The activity forms a\nbasis for why sceptics are unsure as to why the Kremlin\nwould have wanted Donald Trump in the White House[35].\nDisinformation forms a part of this process and groups\nsuch as Cyber-Berkut have been using strategically placed\n“leaks” to further pro-Russian rhetoric[36, 37]. They have also\nleaked information that discredits Hillary Clinton in the\npast, outlining her relationship with Ukrainian billionaire\nVictor Pinchuk[38]. The FSB 16TH Center and 18th Center\nwere found to be behind an internet propaganda effort\ndirected at Ukraine; Ukrainian news sites were controlled\nby Russia and anti-Ukrainian activists[39].\n\nOne way to generate mass amounts of disinformation is\nthe use of bots, which can be used to swamp social media.\nFor example, activists in Turkey and Syria were subject\nto “bot spamming campaigns” in an attempt to drown out\noppositional influence[40]. Bot spamming was allegedly\nused during the first US presidential debate, when 37.7%\nof pro-Trump tweets (22.3% pro-Clinton tweets) were\nsuggested to have been from bots.[41]\n\n\n32. https://securelist.com/files/2016/10/Bartholomew-GuerreroSaade-VB2016.pdf\n33. https://securelist.com/files/2016/10/Bartholomew-GuerreroSaade-VB2016.pdf\n34. https://ccdcoe.org/sites/default/files/multimedia/pdf/CyberWarinPerspective_Lange_Svetoka_12.pdf\n35. http://time.com/4783932/inside-russia-social-media-war-america/\n36. https://www.wired.com/2017/05/russian-hackers-using-tainted-leaks-sow-disinformation/\n37. https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/\n38. https://www.cyberscoop.com/cyberberkut-returns-hillary-clinton/\n39. https://autoblog.postblue.info/autoblogs/lamaredugoffrblog_6aa4265372739b936776738439d4ddb430f5fa2e/media/\ne69ef19e.FSB-IO-UKRAINE.pdf\n40. http://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2017/02/Comprop-Working-Paper-Hwang-and-Rosen.pdf\n41. http://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/\n\n\n-----\n\n## Future Concerns\n\nIn light of Russia’s assertive foreign policy and willingness\nto conduct information warfare, there are some predictive\nareas which may see either direct attacks or more subtle\ninfluence:\n\n### European elections\n\nThere are a number of European elections in 2017. If it\nis the case that European democratic uncertainty or the\nright government can help Russia achieve its strategic\ngoals, the likeliness of interference in the campaigns up\nto and during the elections should be considered likely.\nBecause certain economies are more important to Russia,\nit is more likely that these are the ones Moscow will be\nobserving carefully and attempting to manipulate. The\nfollowing elections are set to take place:\n\n- Norwegian parliamentary election, 11 September 2017\n\n- German federal election, 24 September 2017\n\n- Catalan independence referendum, 1 October 2017\n\n- Portuguese local election, 1 October 2017\n\n- Austrian legislative election, 15 October 2017\n\n- Czech legislative election, 20-21 October 2017\n\n- Danish local elections, 21 November 2017\n\n- Slovenian presidential election, November 2017\n\n- Georgian local elections, 2017\n\n- Estonian municipal elections, 2017\n\nThe outcome of Germany’s election will be important\nas they are a substantial export and import partner.\nRussia was reported to have hacked into the German\nparliamentary systems in 2015[42] and Germany’s proimmigrant stance was also undermined by fabricated\nstories of rape published in Russian media[43]. It would be\nprudent to observe if any candidates stand out as being\nmore sympathetic to Moscow, or as being outliers capable\nof undermining confidence and observing potential PsyOps.\n\n\n### Balkans\n\nRussia has stepped up its hybrid warfare tactics in the\nBalkans. This was seen in Montenegro previous to its\nrecent successful application to NATO when in 2016 the\ncountry was victim to an orchestrated coup[44]. Montenegro\nsought support from Britain as it faced cyber-attacks\non the day the coup was supposed to take place, and\nthen again in February this year[45]. Russian media outlets\ntargeted Montenegro citizens with campaigns several\nweeks before the Parliamentary elections in October\n2016, depicting the country’s leadership as “corrupted,\nbribed and a pawn of the US and NATO”[46]. An uptick in\nRussian cyber activity is increasingly likely as NATO\ndeployments expand in surrounding areas, and Russian\nmilitary presence increases respectively. The Balkans\nsits precariously between these rival regions of influence.\nDue to the encroaching influence of NATO in the region,\nand Russia’s failed attempt at dissuading Montenegro\nfrom joining the NATO alliance, retribution in the form of\ncontinued interference is a strong possibility. NATO was\nundermined by lack of coherent support when Crimea\nwas annexed. Russia will attempt to posture and send a\nstrong signal to the Balkan region. Kosovo falls within this\nvulnerable group as it has sought NATO membership as\nwell.\n\n### Central Europe and the Baltic states\n\nEstonia and Latvia are recognised as being particularly\nvulnerable to any attempt at a Russian fuelled Hybridwar or even conventional war. They are already NATO\nmembers, but there are concerns that Russia will seek to\nuse Russian minorities to gain influence[47]. This is likely\nto take the same Modus Operandi as other previously\narticulated attempts to interfere; PsyOps, electronic\nattacks aimed at spreading disinformation and discrediting\nor undermining current leadership. The form of\ninterference might be ambiguous, which serves to thwart\na confident stance from NATO and the EU. This would\nfurther undermine the credibility of the US.\n\n\n42. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36284447\n43. https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/testimonies/CT400/CT468/RAND_CT468.pdf\n44. https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/congressional_testimony/ts170713_Samp_testimony.\npdf?yGQ2Mn4EWBPNYQLN3A367gqqqoXpojVf\n45. https://cyber-peace.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Montenegro-asks-for-British-help-after-cyber-attacks-in-wake-ofRussian-backed-coup-plot.pdf\n46. https://www.ft.com/content/cab4c2de-72a1-11e7-93ff-99f383b09ff9?mhq5j=e1\n47. https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1500/RR1577/RAND_RR1577.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\nThe four “Visegrad” countries (Poland, Hungary,\nCzech Republic and Slovakia) are a group of Central\nEuropean nations that have a shared history, including\na communist past and Soviet occupation. Russia\nexerts broad internal influence in these countries\nthrough its regional energy policy, diplomatic activity\nand information warfare. A study on the vulnerability\nto subversive influence places Hungary as the most\nvulnerable to “hostile foreign influence”[48]. In Hungary,\nit appears that the ruling party “Fidesz” has positioned\nitself as openly pro-Russian since 2010[49, 50]. It is Russia’s\nrole in the energy sectors of these countries that helps\nfurther their influence[51]. Poland is the least susceptible\nto this type of influence from Russia.\n\n### The Unites States and the Kremlin\n\nThe foreign relations between the US and Russia have\nturned rapidly frosty. During the first week of August\nPresident Donald Trump signed a bill into law that\nlevies new sanctions on Russia. Trump has largely\nbeen seen as a President that does not seek to label\nRussia as an “enemy”[52]. This law however, prevents\nPresident Trump from lifting the sanctions or returning\ntwo US-based Russian diplomatic compounds. Russia\nretaliated against the sanctions by announcing 755\nAmerican diplomatic staff are to be expelled, and two US\ndiplomatic properties seized[53, 54]. Although supported by\nUS congress, the decision to impose sanctions has not\n\nbeen met with the same confidence in Europe. Germany\nand Austria detailed concerns in a joint press release.\n\n\nThis is likely to be because of anxieties over the planned\n“Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline”[55].\n\nThe economic future of Russia, which has been markedly\naffected by previous sanctions, affects other European\ncountries too. This conflict of interests will likely\ncontinue as the impact of the sanctions is felt moving\nforward. Because Russia seems to have felt there was\na possibility of the sanctions being lifted, the new bill\nmay be seen as a betrayal. As a result, it is unlikely that\nRussia will cease seeking to undermine US economic\ninterests in Europe and abroad. This activity will likely\ntake a number of forms to continue Russia’s strategic\nplans:\n\n- Proxy cyber wars fought between the two regions are\na possibility in areas of strategic significance;\n\n- Economic espionage to hinder or steal an advantage\nfrom competing companies affected by the sanctions;\n\n- Direct retaliation in order to exert influence over the\nUS and its decisions.\n\nAll possibilities are converged due to the consequences\nof the sanctions in Europe. Meaning that European\ncountries will also have to make decisions as to their\nown position, and subsequent accepted risk of retaliation\nfrom Russia. The real impact of this issue remains to be\nseen.\n\n## About the Author\n\nSara Moore (smoore@anomali.com) is a Cyber Threat\nIntelligence Analyst at Anomali.\n\n\n48. http://www.cepolicy.org/publications/vulnerability-index-subversive-russian-influence-central-europe-0\n49. http://www.riskandforecast.com/post/in-depth-analysis/russia-s-far-right-friends_349.html\n50. http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/03/30/the-real-russian-threat-to-central-eastern-europe-2/\n51. https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/testimonies/CT400/CT468/RAND_CT468.pdf\n52. http://russiancouncil.ru/en/news/riac-urban-breakfast-is-there-a-future-for-russia-us-relations-/\n53. http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/07/russia-expels-755-diplomats-response-sanctions-170730201720880.html\n54. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/30/world/europe/russia-sanctions-us-diplomats-expelled.html\n55. https://www.ft.com/content/cab4c2de-72a1-11e7-93ff-99f383b09ff9?mhq5j=e1\n\n\n-----",
