Within\nminutes, we observed Cobalt Strike and other malicious tools that all pointed toward a\ntroubling conclusion: the hospital was probably a few hours away from a full-blown Ryuk\nransomware outbreak. Thanks in no small part to our incident response partners at Kroll,\nwhose Responder team rapidly engaged and began active containment steps as we\ndetected threats, that didn’t happen.\n\nThis week, news has spread that many hospitals in the United States are being attacked by\nRyuk ransomware—and are very likely experiencing some version of what we’ve just\ndescribed. Despite being in the throes of a pandemic that’s already over-burdening global\npublic health infrastructure, ransomware crews have been escalating their operations\nagainst hospitals for months now.\n\nThese attacks are abhorrent. The people responsible for them are despicable. And we, like\nDHS CISA, Mandiant, and others in the information security community, want to help the\nhospitals that care for all of us however we can. So we’re sharing the details of how we\nthwarted these operators earlier this month—in the hopes you can take this information and\nbetter protect your own organizations.\n\n## Background\n\n\n-----\n\nWe ve been following all the recent reporting and tweets about hospitals being attacked by\n[Ryuk ransomware. But Ryuk isn’t new to us… we’ve been tracking it for years. More](https://redcanary.com/blog/ryuk-ransomware-attack/)\nimportant than just looking at Ryuk ransomware itself, though, is looking at the operators\nbehind it and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)—especially those used\n_[before they encrypt any data. The operators of Ryuk ransomware are known by different](https://redcanary.com/blog/detecting-and-mitigating-ransomware/)_\nnames in the community, including “WIZARD SPIDER,” “UNC1878,” and “Team9.” The\nmalware they use has included TrickBot, Anchor, Bazar, Ryuk, and others.\n\nMany in the community have shared reporting about these operators and malware families\n(check out the end of this blog post for links to some excellent reporting from other teams),\nso we wanted to focus narrowly on what we’ve observed: BazarLoader/BazarBackdoor\n(which we’re collectively calling Bazar) used for initial access, followed by deployment of\nCobalt Strike, and hours or days later, the potential deployment of Ryuk ransomware. We\n[have certainly seen TrickBot lead to Ryuk ransomware in the past. This month, however,](https://redcanary.com/blog/ryuk-ransomware-attack/)\nwe’ve observed Bazar as a common initial access method, leading to our assessment that\nBazar is a greater threat at this time for the eventual deployment of Ryuk.\n\n## What we’ve seen and how you can detect it\n\nWhile every ransomware outbreak can play out in different ways, we want to focus on the\nattack we saw in mid-October and stopped before ransomware was deployed. As we walk\n**through this specific attack, we’ll identify 10 detection opportunities that work for us**\n**—and we hope they’ll work for you too. This attack can serve as a functional example for**\nwhat you might expect to see if you’re responsible for defending a healthcare organization.\n\nIf you’re interested in the MITRE ATT&CK® techniques covered by this incident, check out\n[the ATT&CK Navigator layer here. You can learn more about ATT&CK Navigator here.](https://github.com/redcanaryco/public-research/blob/master/intelligence/20201029-Bazar-Cobalt-Strike-Incident-Navigator-Layer.json)\n\nThis graphic provides an overall representation of how the attack unfolded. We’ll dive into\nthe details, complete with detection opportunities, below.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nInitial access came by way of a phishing email containing a PDF attachment. The user\nopened this attachment and clicked on a link in the PDF, which connected to Google Drive\nand downloaded a file named `Report[mm]-[dd].exe (for example, the file name would`\nbe `Report10-29.exe if the email was delivered on October 29). This` `.exe is known as`\nBazar, which has different components known by the community as BazaLoader,\nBazarLoader, and BazarBackdoor.\n\n## Detection Opportunity 1: Process hollowing of cmd.exe\n\nThis `.exe file used process hollowing techniques to inject into` `cmd.exe . You can identify`\nthis process hollowing, as we did, by looking for instances of the Windows Command\nprompt ( cmd.exe ) executing without any command-line parameters and establishing a\nnetwork connection. If that’s too noisy, you could try limiting the network connections to port\n443 or 53. You could also limit false positives by looking for child processes spawned by the\nhollowed `cmd.exe process. Typical child processes associated with Bazar include:`\n```\ncmd.exe, svchost.exe, explorer.exe, nltest.exe, and net.exe, as shown in\n\n```\nthe process tree below.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Detection Opportunity 2: Enumerating domain trusts activity with\n```\nnltest.exe\n\n```\nWe then observed several reconnaissance commands associated with Bazar. Specifically,\nwe observed the adversary using `nltest.exe to make domain trust determinations. While`\nyou probably can’t disable `nltest.exe, looking for instances of it executing with a`\ncommand line that includes `/dclist:<domain>,` `/domain_trusts or` `/all_trusts`\nhas proven to be a very high-fidelity analytic for us to catch both Bazar (in this incident) as\nwell as TrickBot (in past incidents). In fact, based on this overlap, it appears likely that\nBazar may be reusing some code from TrickBot, which could lead to some confusion over\nwhich malware family is which.\n\n## Detection Opportunity 3: Enumerating domain admins with net group\n\nWe also saw the adversary attempting to enumerate Windows domain administrator\naccounts, a behavior that we commonly associate with ransomware operators. In particular,\nwe find it useful to look for `net group \"domain admins\" /dom and` `net group \"domain`\n```\nadmins\" /domain .\n\n## Detection Opportunity 4: Process hollowing of explorer.exe\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nDuring this phase, we also saw the adversary use process hollowing with both\n```\nexplorer.exe and svchost.exe . We observed explorer.exe spawning\nsvchost.exe —this isn’t normal, so you should look for that in your environment. More\n\n```\nbroadly, you can look for `svchost.exe processes where the parent is not`\n```\nservices.exe to identify this and other malicious activity. (If you’ve never checked it out,\n\n```\n[we highly recommend looking at the SANS Hunt Evil poster!)](https://www.sans.org/security-resources/posters/dfir/hunt-evil-165)\n\nAnother way we detected this activity was by looking for `svchost.exe with no command-`\nline options. Legitimate instances of `svchost.exe should almost always have command-`\nline options that include `-k and the name of a service the process manages. Instances of`\n```\nsvchost.exe with no command-line options are suspicious and may indicate that\nsvchost.exe has been spawned to host injected code—like we saw in this incident.\n\n## Detection Opportunity 5: Attempted lateral movement via WMI + PowerShell + Cobalt Strike\n\n```\nNext, a Cobalt Strike binary was dropped on the endpoint as a `.dll file and executed by`\n```\nrundll32.exe . With that, the intrusion began spreading laterally via Cobalt Strike. The\n\n```\noperators used Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) in their lateral movement\nattempt. WMI spawned `cmd.exe, which subsequently spawned PowerShell with an`\nencoded command line. This encoded PowerShell creates another Cobalt Strike Beacon.\nWe’ve found that looking for encoded PowerShell is a great way to catch this specific evil\nand a lot of other evil, too. In this incident, we saw a command line that began with:\n```\npowershell -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand\nJABzAD0ATgBlAHcALQBPAGIAagBlAGMAdAAgAEkATwAuAE0AZQBtAG8AcgB5AFMAdAByAGUAYQBtACgALABbA\n\n```\nCobalt Strike uses the same structure for beacon payloads, consisting of an outer layer of\nBase64 encoding that contains within it another Base64 string, which is gzip-compressed.\nOnce you’ve unzipped this compressed data you’ll see a more standard structure\nunderneath. The string `IEX $DoIt inside the gzip data is a dead-ringer that you’re looking`\n\n\n-----\n\nat Cobalt Strike, but for quick detection purposes, looking for the entire string above in a\ncommand line can help you identify suspicious PowerShell activity. Along these lines,\n[Florian Roth has a Sigma rule that is a great jumping-off point for hunting down suspicious](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/process_creation/win_susp_powershell_enc_cmd.yml)\nencoded PowerShell commands.\n\nIf that’s too noisy in your environment, you could filter this analytic by looking for just\n```\npowershell.exe that is a child of cmd.exe and a “grandchild” of wmiprvse.exe .\n\n## Detection Opportunity 6: Lateral movement via Cobalt Strike’s SMB PsExec module\n\n```\nWe then observed successful lateral movement using Cobalt Strike’s SMB PsExec module.\n```\nservices.exe executed the previously-dropped Beacon payload with a child process of\nrundll32.exe . rundll32.exe had no command line arguments and performed multiple\n\n```\nnetwork connections over SMB (TCP port 445) to other systems on the network. The\n```\nadmin$ share was used in each instance. To detect this the way we did, we recommend\n\n```\nlooking for `rundll32.exe executing without any command-line parameters and also`\nestablishing network connections. Additionally, looking in the Windows System Event Log\nfor events with ID 7045 could also give you the opportunity to detect this. Event ID 7045\nrecords the creation of new Windows services and should occur whenever any PsExec-like\nlateral movement occurs.\n\n## Detection Opportunity 7: Enumerating enterprise administrator accounts\n\nNext, we observed the adversaries enumerating enterprise administrator accounts. We\nrecommend looking for the command line `net group \"enterprise admins\" /domain,`\nwhich we observed in this incident, and also helps us catch other malicious activity.\n\n## Detection Opportunity 8: Credential access using lsass from regsvr32\n\nWe then observed the adversaries obtaining credentials. We aren’t sure whether they were\nusing Mimikatz, but we can say they used an lsass cross-process from `regsvr32.exe,`\nwhich is something that Mimikatz is known to do. One way we detect Mimikatz\nSEKURLSA::LogonPasswords execution from any process is by identifying common\n\n`lsass.exe` [process access mask values used by](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/process-security-and-access-rights) [Mimikatz in conjunction with the loading](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)\nof five or more of the following DLLs associated with credential operations:\n\nLogoncli.dll\nSamlib.dll\nVaultcli.dll\nCryptdll.dll\n\n\n-----\n\nWintrust.dll\nWkscli.dll\nNetapi32.dll\nHid.dll\nApphelp.dll\nWinScard.dll\n\nAdditionally, we found that simply looking for `regsvr32.exe making external network`\nconnections, as well as `regsvr32.exe execution without command-line options, helped`\nus detect this activity. As is the theme with many of these detection opportunities, these\nsame analytics have helped us detect a lot of other evil in the past too.\n\n## Detection Opportunity 9: Bloodhound execution\n\nAround the time of `regsvr32.exe execution, the operators also executed Sharphound or`\nBloodhound (we aren’t sure which) as code injected into `regsvr32.exe . This tool`\nperforms a massive amount of reconnaissance of networks hosting Windows systems to\nfind privileged accounts to target. We often detect Sharphound/Bloodhound activity by\nhunting for many SMB connections over port 445 originating from a single process.\nBloodhound produces many more port 445 connections in large network environments, so\nit’s easier to spot in network traffic in larger environments as compared to smaller\nenvironments. If you’re in a smaller environment, you might have to tune this more based\non the normal volume of SMB activity in your network.\n\n## Detection Opportunity 10: Adfind extracting information from Active Directory\n\nLess than an hour after the initial execution, we observed the operators downloading and\nexecuting `adfind.exe` for reconnaissance purposes. `adfind.exe is an open source tool`\nthat extracts information from Active Directory. You could try looking for any use of\n```\nadfind.exe —or disallowing it from your environment completely—but if that’s too noisy,\n\n```\nhere’s the specific commands we saw used that you could detect on:\n```\nAdFind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=computer)\"\nAdFind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=group)\" \nAdFind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)\"\nAdFind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=person)\"\nAdFind.exe -subnets -f \"(objectCategory=subnet)\" \nAdFind.exe -sc trustdmp \nAdFind.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nWe know, that’s a lot. In under an hour, we saw all this activity . . . and detected it! We were\nfortunate that the initial access activity was detected within minutes, as preventative\ncontrols were ineffective and the adversary was moving fast. We immediately notified the\ncustomer and our mutual incident response partner, Kroll. Acting swiftly, Kroll began\nexecuting response processes including isolating endpoints and banning malicious binaries,\nas our CIRT continued to publish detections for the escalating lateral movement and\ncredential theft. When the dust settled, the customer was left with nothing more than the set\nof detections that we escalated, documenting the progression of the threat. Thankfully,\nthere was no ransomware at the medical center that day.\n\n## What you should do now and if an infection occurs\n\nBeyond behavioral analytics that might help unearth potentially malicious activity in your\nenvironment, there is also a long list of proactive and reactive security controls that may\nhelp block a ransomware infection—or limit its effects—in the first place.\n\n### Be prepared ahead of time\n\nSome things to consider before you’re facing a ransomware infection include the following:\n\nMake sure you are maintaining updated operating systems, software, and firmware.\nMaintain backups of important information and have a plan for recovering from\nbackups. It’s important to periodically test your ability to recover from backups. This\nwill help validate your recovery plan and also ensure that your backup data isn’t\ncorrupt or otherwise unrecoverable.\nPeriodically review domain administrator and accounts that have access to admin\nshares across your environment.\nValidate email security gateway policies and consider configuring them to quarantine\nand review documents or archive files before releasing them.\nEducate users so that they exercise caution when opening documents and following\nlinks, especially when they come from an unexpected sender.\nHave a disaster recovery and business continuity plan in place, and use this as an\nopportunity to review it.\n[Consider keeping an incident response partner on retainer. These firms handle](https://www.kroll.com/en/services/cyber-risk/incident-response-litigation-support/cyber-incident-response-retainer)\nransomware response on a daily basis and can provide invaluable assistance that\ncould limit the impact of an outbreak and vastly expedite the recovery process.\nAlso consider investing in third party assessment services like penetration testing to\nperiodically evaluate the efficacy of your security controls and tools that afford you the\nability merge extensive detection and response capabilities.\n\n### Be ready to act quickly\n\nOnce you are aware that something might be awry, act quickly:\n\n\n-----\n\nIsolate or quarantine any endpoints that you suspect might be infected immediately.\nUnplug them if you need to—this could be critical to making sure further activity\ndoesn’t happen.\nIf you have an IR partner, call them immediately. If you don’t, then consider calling an\nincident response firm as soon as possible.\nBan malicious artifacts such as suspect IP addresses, domains, and hashes as soon\nas you become aware of them.\nStart disconnecting services from the network.\nConsider turning off non-critical IT systems.\nIf you have Windows file servers, you can use features built into the File Server\nResource Manager to alert on and fight ransomware. Within FSRM you can create file\ngroups and policies to alert administrators when certain file names or extensions\n[appear within Windows file shares. With a specific configuration, you can create a](https://fsrm.experiant.ca/)\n“crypto canary” on your file servers to notify you when Ryuk or other families encrypt\nfile shares. Depending on how your shares are structured in terms of departments,\nusers, and groups, you can target your response accordingly and visit victim\ncomputers to remove them from the network.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n### From Red Canary\n\n From the Community\n\nDHS alert from Thursday, October 28: [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a)\nThe DFIR Report blog posts, which discuss very similar patterns to what we have\nobserved: [https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/08/ryuks-return/ and](https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/08/ryuks-return/)\n[https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/18/ryuk-in-5-hours/](https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/18/ryuk-in-5-hours/)\nMandiant blog post covering KEGTAP (also known as Bazar) and other malware\nfamilies they have recently observed: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threatresearch/2020/10/kegtap-and-singlemalt-with-a-ransomware-chaser.html\nSANS webcast about UNC1878, a group Mandiant has recently observed deploying\nRyuk, featuring Aaron Stephens and Van Ta from Mandiant and hosted by Red\nCanary’s Director of Intelligence, Katie Nickels: https://www.youtube.com/watch?\nv=BhjQ6zsCVSc\nIndicators of Compromise for UNC1878 released by Mandiant:\n[https://gist.github.com/aaronst/6aa7f61246f53a8dd4befea86e832456](https://gist.github.com/aaronst/6aa7f61246f53a8dd4befea86e832456)\nCybereason blog post on Team9 and Bazar: https://www.cybereason.com/blog/abazar-of-tricks-following-team9s-development-cycles\nKroll recommendations on ransomware preparedness:\nhttps://www.kroll.com/en/services/cyber-risk/assessments-testing/ransomwarepreparedness-assessment\n\n\n-----\n\nCrowdStrike post about WIZARD SPIDER and Bazar:\n[https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/wizard-spider-adversary-update/](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/wizard-spider-adversary-update/)\nVitali Kremez post: https://www.vkremez.com/2020/04/lets-learn-trickbotbazarbackdoor.html\nLares blog post on endpoint hunting in Splunk: https://www.lares.com/blog/endpointhunting-for-unc1878-kegtap-ttps/\n[Joe Slowik’s collection of suspected Ryuk domains: https://pastebin.com/UQs0JtKY](https://pastebin.com/UQs0JtKY)\n\n_[Brian Donohue,](https://redcanary.com/authors/brian-donohue/)_ _[Katie Nickels,](https://redcanary.com/authors/katie-nickels/)_ _[Paul Michaud, Adina Bodkins, Taylor Chapman, Tony](https://redcanary.com/authors/paul-michaud/)_\n_Lambert,_ _[Jeff Felling,](https://redcanary.com/authors/jeff-felling/)_ _[Kyle Rainey,](https://redcanary.com/authors/kyle-rainey/)_ _[Mike Haag,](https://redcanary.com/authors/michael-haag/)_ _[Matt Graeber, and Aaron Didier contributed](https://redcanary.com/authors/matt-graeber/)_\n_to this blog post._\n\nRelated Articles\n\nDetection and response\n\n### ChromeLoader: a pushy malvertiser\n\nDetection and response\n\n### Intelligence Insights: May 2022\n\nDetection and response\n\n### The Goot cause: Detecting Gootloader and its follow-on activity\n\nDetection and response\n\n### Marshmallows & Kerberoasting\n\n**Subscribe to our blog**\n\nOur website uses cookies to provide you with a better browsing experience.
