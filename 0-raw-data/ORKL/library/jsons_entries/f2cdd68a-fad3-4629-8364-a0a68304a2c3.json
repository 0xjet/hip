A locker is a fake page that dupes the user, under\na fictitious pretext (loss of data, legal liability, etc.), into making a call or a money transfer, or\ngiving out payment details. The “locking” consists of preventing the user from leaving the\ncurrent tab, which displays intimidating messages, often with sound and visual effects.\n\nThis type of fraud is not new and has long been on the radar of researchers. The past\ndecade has seen numerous browser locking campaigns targeting users worldwide. Despite\nits mature age, the threat has lost none of its popularity; on the contrary, the number of tricks\n[used by scammers is only growing. They include imitating the “blue screen of death” (BSOD)](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\nin the browser, false warnings about system errors or detected viruses, threats to encrypt\nfiles, legal liability notices, and many others. In this post, we examine two families of lockers\nthat mimic government websites.\n\n## Propagation methods\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth families spread mainly via advertising networks, primarily aimed at selling adult\ncontent and movies in an intrusive manner; for example, through tabs or windows that open\non top of the visited site when loading a page with an embedded ad module (pop-ups) or\nafter clicking anywhere on the page (click-unders). Presumably cybercriminals pay for ads to\nshow browser lockers in pop-ups.\n\n## Family #1. Fake websites of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs: “Give us your money”\n\nMembers of the first family under consideration mimic the website of the Russian Ministry of\nInternal Affairs (MVD), and are thus aimed at users from Russia. In Q4 2020, more than\n55,000 users encountered them.\n\n**_Example of a fake MVD website_**\n\n### What the victim sees (and hears)\n\nOn landing on a fake browlock site, the user typically sees a warning, supposedly from the\nbrowser, saying that if they leave the page some changes might not be saved.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the user simply closes the tab, nothing happens; but if they click anywhere on the page,\nthe main content of the locker expands to full screen. As a result, an imitation of a computer\nscreen with an open browser appears in front of the user: at the bottom is a taskbar with the\nGoogle Chrome icon, and at the top is an address bar displaying the real URL of the MVD.\nThe notification on the page states that the device has been locked due to a violation of the\nlaw. Under the pretext of a fine, the victim is instructed to transfer a certain amount to a\nmobile account, ranging in size from 3,000 to 10,000 rubles (US$40–130). In case of refusal,\nthe ransomwarers threaten file encryption, as well as criminal liability under Article 242 of the\nRussian Criminal Code. The page is accompanied by an audio recording with threats and a\ndemand to pay the fine.\n\n### Technical details\n\nThe scammers use full-screen mode to make it difficult for the user to access the browser\nwindow controls and taskbar, and to create a locking effect. In addition, to convince the\nvictim that the mouse is unresponsive, the attackers hide the cursor by manipulating the CSS\nproperty cursor.\n\nThe page also uses the following code to handle keystrokes:\n\nAfter deobfuscation, we obtain a very small script:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt was probably assumed that running this code would result in the Escape (keycode=27),\nCtrl (keycode=17), Alt (keycode=18) and Tab (keycode=9) keystrokes being ignored, as well\nas F1, F3, F4, F5 and F12. This could prevent the user from leaving the page using various\nkeyboard shortcuts, but the trick does not work in modern browsers.\n\nAnother interesting detail is the animation of the supposed file encryption process, which is\nshown in the screenshots below. It consists of an endless succession of random numbers\nand letters, simulating enumeration of allegedly encrypted files in the system directory.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Page addresses\n\nCybercriminals often use alphanumeric domain names, where the number sequence\ncorresponds to a date close to the domain registration date and the letter sequence is an\nabbreviation, for example, “mpa” (the Russian abbreviation for “municipal legal act”) or “kad”\n(“cadastral office”). Example of a fraudulent domain: 0402mpa21[.]ru.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also saw domain names composed of topic-based words, such as police or mvd .\nCybercriminals use them to mimic the addresses of the legitimate sites of law enforcement\nagencies. An example of such a domain is mvd-ru[.]tech.\n\n### Mobile version of fake MVD websites\n\nThe threat also exists on mobile devices. To determine the type of device during propagation,\nthe User-Agent field in the header of the HTTP request is checked. As in the case of the “full”\nversion, the victim is accused of breaking the law and ordered to pay a fine; the amount,\nhowever, is smaller than in the desktop version.\n\n## Family #2. Fake law enforcement websites in the Middle East: “Give us your card details”\n\nThe second family differs in the way that money is transferred to the ransomwarers. As\nbefore, the user is accused of violating the law, informed that their computer has been\nlocked, and instructed to pay a fine. However, instead of leaving their account or telephone\nnumber for payment, the cybercriminals insert a data entry form on the page asking for card\ndetails\n\n\n-----\n\nThis family of lockers is targeted mostly at users in the Middle East (UAE, Oman, Kuwait,\nQatar, and Saudi Arabia). In addition, we have seen fraudulent pages disguised as Indian\nand Singaporean law enforcement websites. European equivalents are slightly less common.\n\nIn Q4 2020, this family threatened more than 130,000 users.\n\n**_Examples of ransomware pages_**\n\n### Technical details\n\nFrom a technical viewpoint, browser lockers of the second type are in many ways similar to\nthe fake MVD websites. As in the first case, the content expands to full screen to make it\ndifficult for the user to access the browser window controls and taskbar. At the top of the\npage is an address bar with the URL of the official government resource, and at the bottom is\n\n\n-----\n\na fake taskbar with the Google Chrome icon. The mouse pointer is not displayed, and a\nscript similar to the one above is used to handle keystrokes. Besides entering payment data,\nno actions on the page are available to the user.\n\nThe screenshot below shows an obfuscated script that implements the “locking,” as well as\ncollects and sends the user-input data.\n\nThe victim’s payment details are transferred via an HTTP POST request to the same\nmalicious resource that hosts the page. In the screenshot below is an example of a request\nto send payment details to the malicious site sslwebtraffic[.]cf.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe threats investigated are not technically complex. Their functionality is rather primitive\nand aims to create the illusion of locking the computer and intimidate the victim. Landing on\nsuch a page by mistake will not harm the user’s device or data, as long as they do not fall for\nthe cybercriminals’ smoke-and-mirror tactics. What’s more, to get rid of the locker requires no\nspecial knowledge or technical means.\n\n\n-----\n\nBut if the user panics, they could lose money.
