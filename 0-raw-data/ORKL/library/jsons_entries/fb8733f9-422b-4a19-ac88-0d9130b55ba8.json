It’s not a version of PlugX but a version of Sisfider studied\nby Ncc group. https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-andevents/blogs/2018/june/cve-2017-8570-rtf-and-the-sisfader-rat/\n\nWith the behaviour graph of Joe Sandbox, we can recognize the same interactions with\noperating system than my last article and the paper of NCC Group.\n\n\n-----\n\nBehaviour of malwares\nThe difference with the version studied by NCC Group is the Package Ole Object. In the\narticle of NCC Group, the researchers talk about a SCT File and many javascript\nmanipulations for dropping the RAT on the disk and to start it.\n\nHere, the payload is encrypted in 8.t file\n\nIf we analyze EQNEDT32.exe overwritten to recognise the payload, we have the same\ntechnics anti emulation with the same value.\n\nIn a thread, the process posts in a queue the value 5ACE8D0Ah.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnti emulation tricks\n\nAnti emulation tricks\nThe verification is calling GetMessage() and the value is stored in EAX in the function\nsub_401A60.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe comparaison is made in the calling function sub_4027D0.\n\nAnti emulation tricks verification\nJuste after we found again the loop of decryption for the config.\n\ncall to loop of decryption\n\n\n-----\n\nLoop of decrypting config\nIt’s the same algorithm described: a simple XOR loop with rolling key.\n\nThe mechanism of persistent is the same with a service creation just after dropping differents\nfiles and a privilege escalation.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe found the same name of the dll files.\n\nPersistence and loading agent\nThe malware overwrite the comobject\n\n{9BA05972-F6A8–11CF-A442–00A0C90A8F39} to execute when this com object is called to\nmake a persistence\n\n\n-----\n\nComObject Adding\nAll evidences show is the same payload Sisfader RAT.\n\nThreat Intel\n\nThe toolset for exploiting the module of equation is the same using of the compromission for\nVietnameses Officials used by Goblin Panda. (APT 1937CN)\n\nIf we check the domain contacted by EQNEDT32.exe is kmbk8.hicp.net. This address is a\nreal good pivot. It makes the link with Goblin Panda and SisFader RAT.\n\nAnd the infrastructure is very interesting this domains resolved on three IPs:\n\n122.158.140.100, 122.158.140.100 and 103.255.45.200\n\nTheses addresses can permit to found others domains:\n\nSd123.eicp.net with new IP 180.131.58.9 and cv3sa.gicp.net with new IP 1.188.233.201\n\n\n-----\n\nInfrastructure\nThe Ip Address 103.255.45.200 has two domains:\n\n[www.36106g.com](http://www.36106g.com/)\n\n36106g.com\n\nInfrastructure\nAll infrastructure is based at Shanghai.\n\nThe victims are different than the Vietnameses campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nThey targeted Telecom Firms pretending to be the Intelligence Service of Russia (FSB)\n\nRTFs content\nSo Gobelin Panda targets like the report of CrowdStrike https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281OBQ-266/images/ReportGlobalThreatIntelligence.pdf he telecom industries in Russia.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGoblin Panda used Sisfader RAT to target the Telecom Firms russian with the same\nexploitation techniques for Vietnameses Officials. They updated theirs technics than the\nreport of NCC group.\n\nIOCs:\n\nRtfs:\n\n722e5d3dcc8945f69135dc381a15b5cad9723cd11f7ea20991a3ab867d9428c7\n\n71c94bb0944eb59cb79726b20177fb2cd84bf9b4d33b0efbe9aed58bb2b43e9c\n\nDomains IP:\n\n1.188.233.201 cv3sa.gicp.net\n\n1.188.236.22 cv3sa.gicp.net\n\n1.188.236.22 kmbk8.hicp.net\n\n1.188.236.22 sd123.eicp.net\n\n103.255.45.200 36106g.com\n\n\n-----\n\n103.255.45.200 cv3sa.gicp.net\n\n103.255.45.200 kmbk8.hicp.net\n\n103.255.45.200 sd123.eicp.net\n\n[103.255.45.200 www.36106g.com](http://www.36106g.com/)\n\n122.158.140.100 cv3sa.gicp.net\n\n122.158.140.100 kmbk8.hicp.net\n\n122.158.140.100 sd123.eicp.net\n\n\n-----",
