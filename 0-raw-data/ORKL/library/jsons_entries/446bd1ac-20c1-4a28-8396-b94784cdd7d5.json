That changed today when I discovered two samples of\n[Stampado on VirusTotal. It is currently unknown if these samples are from a live distribution](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/342933cb4cbb31a2c30ac1733afc318a6e5cd0226160a59197686d635ec71b20/analysis/)\ncampaign or were submitted by the distributor/developer to test how well they are detected\nby security programs. The best part is that it really doesn't matter as from these samples a\n[decryptor has already been made by Fabian Wosar.](https://twitter.com/fwosar)\n\n**Stampado Lock Screen**\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat we do know, though, is that Stampado is fully functional and written in the AutoIT\nscripting language. When installed, it will encrypt a victim's files using AES encryption and\nthen demand a ransom in order to get your files back. The two samples I have discovered\nhave the names kek.exe and WifiHack.exe. At this time the ransom amount is currently\nunknown and you need to email the specified email address in order to get payment\ninstructions.\n\n## How to Decrypt files encrypted by Stampado\n\n[Fabian Wosar, of Emsisoft, was able to analyze the Stampado samples and create a decryptor](https://twitter.com/fwosar)\nfor the infection. To use Fabian's decryptor, simply download it from the following\nURL: [https://decrypter.emsisoft.com/stampado. Once downloaded, execute it and go into](https://decrypter.emsisoft.com/stampado)\nthe options screen, where you will need to enter your ID and the email address found on the\nlock screen.\n\n**Decryptor Options**\n\nOnce you enter in the required information, you can go back to the Decryptor tab and begin\ndecrypting your files.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Decrypting Files**\n\nWhen the decryptor finished decrypting the files, you can close the program.\n\n## Possible link between Stampado and Jigsaw?\n\nThere are some interesting correlations, though possibly weak, between the Jigsaw\nransomware and Stampado.\n\nOne of the nastier \"features\" of Stampado is its Russian Roulette, which will randomly delete\nan encrypted file every 6 hours. Each time this roulette countdown reaches 0, the amount of\nfiles are doubled. This is the same incrementing file deletion behavior is also exhibited by\nJigsaw during its countdown. As file deletion in ransomware is very rare, it is interesting to\nsee a similar behavior between the two ransomware infections.\n\n[Coincidentally, Michael Gillespie found a variant of Jigsaw yesterday that included the email](https://twitter.com/demonslay335)\naddress stampado@narod.ru. Coincidence or not?\n\n\n-----\n\n**Jigsaw background containing a email with Stampado**\n\nLast, but not least, Stampado is being sold on the same darkweb site as Jigsaw. Granted,\nthese connections are weak at best, yet I felt it was worth mentioning.\n\n## How Stampado encrypts a victim's Files\n\nWhen Stampado is installed it will copy itself to %AppData%\\scvhost.exe and encrypt\nspecific file types found under the victim's %UserProfile% folder using AES encryption.\nWhen it encrypts a file, it will append the .locked extension to it. This means that a file\ncalled test.jpg, will be named test.jpg.locked. The files currently targeted by Stampado are:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n.jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .bmp, .c, .doc, .docx, .ppt, .pptx, .xls, .xlsx, .mov, .mp3, .cpp,\n.au3, .pas, .php, .wav, .wma, .wmv, .mp4, .rar, .zip, .7z, .001, .html, .pdf, .txt,\n.ai, .dmg, .dwg, .ps, .flv, .xml, .skp, .aiml, .sql, .cdr, .svg, .png, .ico, .ani,\n.m4a, .avi, .csv, .d3dbsp, .sc2save, .sie, .sum, .ibank, .t13, .t12, .qdf, .gdb,\n.tax, .pkpass, .bc6, .bc7, .bkp, .bak, .qic, .bkf, .sidn, .sidd, .mddata, .itl,\n.itdb, .icxs, .hvpl, .hplg, .hkdb, .mdbackup, .syncdb, .gho, .cas, .map, .wmo, .itm,\n.sb, .fos, .mcgame, .vdf, .ztmp, .sis, .sid, .ncf, .menu, .layout, .dmp, .blob, .esm,\n.001, .vtf, .dazip, .fpk, .mlx, .kf, .iwd, .vpk, .tor, .psk, .rim, .w3x, .fsh, .ntl,\n.arch00, .lvl, .snx, .cfr, .ff, .vpp_pc, .lrf, .m2, .mcmeta, .vfs0, .mpqge, .kdb,\n.db0, .DayZProfile, .rofl, .hkx, .bar, .upk, .das, .iwi, .litemod, .asset, .forge,\n.ltx, .bsa, .apk, .re4, .sav, .lbf, .slm, .bik, .epk, .rgss3a, .pak, .big, .unity3d,\n.wotreplay, .xxx, .desc, .py, .m3u, .js, .css, .rb, .p7c, .p7b, .p12, .pfx, .pem,\n.crt, .cer, .der, .x3f, .srw, .pef, .ptx, .r3d, .rw2, .rwl, .raw, .raf, .orf, .nrw,\n.mrwref, .mef, .erf, .kdc, .dcr, .cr2, .crw, .bay, .sr2, .srf, .arw, .3fr, .dng,\n.cdr, .indd, .eps, .pdd, .psd, .dbfv, .mdf, .wb2, .rtf, .wpd, .dxg, .xf, .pst,\n.accdb, .mdb, .pptm, .ppsx, .pps, .xlk, .xlsb, .xlsm, .wps, .docm, .odb, .odc, .odm,\n.odp, .ods, .odt\n\n```\nDuring the encryption process, Stampado will also create two files in the %AppData%\nfolder that have 32 character hexadecimal names. One file will be used to store a list of the\nencrypted files and the other file will contain status information used by the ransomware.\n\nWhen the encryption is finished, Stampado will display a lock screen that contains a unique\nID that is associated with the victim and an email address that is needed to get payment\ninformation. The current emails used by the ransomware are ransom64@sigaint.com\nand paytodecrypt@sigaint.org. Victim's are told to email the associated email address for\npayment instructions and once payment is made, they will receive a key to enter into the lock\nscreen to decrypt the files.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Stampado Lock Screen**\n\nOn the lock screen there will also be a timer called Next Russian Roulette file deletion\nand Time until total loss. When the Russian Roulette countdown reaches 0, a randomly\nselected encrypted file will be deleted. Each time the Russian Roulette countdown reaches 0,\nthe amount of encrypted files deleted will be doubled. When the Time until total loss timer\nreaches zero, all of the encrypted data on the computer will be deleted.\n\nAs already stated, there is no need to pay a ransom to Stampado as a decryptor has already\nbeen made.\n\n### Files associated with the Stampado Ransomware:\n```\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\[random]\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\[random]\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\scvhost.exe\n\n Registry entries associated with the Stampado Ransomware:\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Windows Update\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\scvhost.exe\n\n IOCs:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nSHA 256 Hash: 342933cb4cbb31a2c30ac1733afc318a6e5cd0226160a59197686d635ec71b20\nSHA-256 Hash: 78db508226ccacd363fc0f02b3ae326a2bdd0baed3ae51ddf59c3fc0fcf60669\n\n```\n[Decrypted](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/decrypted/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Stampado](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/stampado/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
