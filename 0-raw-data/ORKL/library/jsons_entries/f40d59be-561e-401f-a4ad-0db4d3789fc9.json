Since then, tens of thousands of people have been killed, millions of Ukrainians have fled and the country has sustained tens of billions of dollars worth of damage. Importantly, this marks the first time  that cyber operations have played such  a prominent role in a world conflict.\n\n\n**Since the war began, governments, companies,**\n\ncivil society groups, and countless others have\n\nbeen working around the clock to support\n\nthe Ukrainian people and their institutions.

That’s why one of our\n\nmost important contributions to date has been our\n\nongoing work to provide cybersecurity assistance\n\nto Ukraine. Shortly after the invasion, for example,\n\n[we expanded eligibility for Project Shield, our free](https://projectshield.withgoogle.com/landing)\n\nprotection against distributed denial of service\n\nattacks (DDoS), so that Ukrainian government\n\nwebsites and embassies worldwide could stay\n\nonline and continue to offer their critical services.\n\n\nWe continue to provide direct assistance to the\n\nUkrainian government and critical infrastructure\n\n[entities under the Cyber Defense Assistance](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crdf-global-becomes-platform-for-cyber-defense-assistance-collaborative-cdac-for-ukraine-301676373.html)\n\n[Collaborative — including compromise assess-](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crdf-global-becomes-platform-for-cyber-defense-assistance-collaborative-cdac-for-ukraine-301676373.html)\n\n[ments, incident response services, shared cyber](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/insights/ukraine-crisis-resource-center)\n\n[threat intelligence, and security transformation](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/insights/ukraine-crisis-resource-center)\n\n[services — to help the Ukrainian government](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/insights/ukraine-crisis-resource-center)\n\ndetect, mitigate, and defend against cyber\n\nattacks. In addition, we continue to implement\n\n[protections for users and track and disrupt](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/update-threat-landscape-ukraine/)\n\ncyber threats to help raise awareness among\n\nthe security community and high risk users and\n\nmaintain information quality.\n\nThis level of collective defense — between\n\ngovernments, companies, and security stakehold\ners across the world — is unprecedented in scope.\n\nIt is important then to pause and reflect on this\n\nwork and our learnings one year later, and share\n\nthose with the global security community to help\n\nprepare better defenses for the future. This report\n\noutlines our analysis of these issues and includes\n\nthe following three observations, informed by over\n\ntwo decades of experience managing complex\n\nglobal security events.\n\n\n-----\n\n**First, Russian government-backed attackers have engaged**\n\n**in an aggressive, multi-pronged effort to gain a decisive wartime**\n\n**advantage in cyberspace, often with mixed results.**\n\nThis includes a significant shift in various groups’ focus towards\n\nUkraine, a dramatic increase in the use of destructive attacks on\n\nUkrainian government, military and civilian infrastructure, a spike\n\nin spear-phishing activity targeting NATO countries, and an uptick\n\nin cyber operations designed to further multiple Russian objectives.\n\nFor example, we’ve observed threat actors hack-and-leak sensitive\n\ninformation to further a specific narrative.\n\n**Second, Moscow has leveraged the full spectrum of information**\n\n**operations — from overt state-backed media to covert platforms**\n\n**and accounts — to shape public perception of the war.**\n\nThese operations have three goals: (1) undermine the Ukrainian gov\nernment; (2) fracture international support for Ukraine; and (3) maintain\n\ndomestic support in Russia for the war. We’ve seen spikes of activity\n\nassociated with key events in the conflict such as the buildup, invasion,\n\nand troop mobilization in Russia. At Google, we’ve worked aggressively\n\nacross products, teams, and regions to counter these activities where\n\nthey violate our policies and disrupt overt and covert information\n\noperations campaigns, but continue to encounter relentless attempts\n\nto circumvent our policies.\n\n**Finally, the invasion has triggered a notable shift in the Eastern**\n\n**European cybercriminal ecosystem that will likely have long term**\n\n**implications for both coordination between criminal groups and**\n\n**the scale of cybercrime worldwide.**\n\nSome groups, for example, have split over political allegiances and\n\ngeopolitics, while others have lost prominent operators. This will impact\n\nthe way we think about these groups and our traditional understanding\n\nof their capabilities. We’ve also seen a trend towards specialization in\n\nthe ransomware ecosystem that blends tactics across actors, making\n\ndefinitive attribution more difficult. Importantly, the war in Ukraine has\n\nalso been defined by what we expected — but didn’t see. For example,\n\nwe didn’t observe a surge of attacks against critical infrastructure\n\noutside of Ukraine.\n\n\nTogether, these observations point to several broader\n\nforward looking assessments for the security community\n\nfor 2023:\n\nWe assess with high confidence that Russian government-backed\n\nattackers will continue to conduct cyber attacks against Ukraine\n\nand NATO partners to further Russian strategic objectives.\n\nWe assess with high confidence that Moscow will increase\n\ndisruptive and destructive attacks in response to developments\n\non the battlefield that fundamentally shift the balance — real\n\nor perceived — towards Ukraine (e.g., troop losses, new foreign\n\ncommitments to provide political or military support, etc.). These\n\nattacks will primarily target Ukraine but increasingly expand to\n\ninclude NATO partners.\n\nWe assess with moderate confidence that Russia will continue\n\nto increase the pace and scope of information operations to\n\nachieve the objectives described above, particularly as we\n\napproach key moments like international funding, military aid,\n\ndomestic referendums, and more. What’s less clear is whether\n\nthese activities will achieve the desired impact, or simply harden\n\nopposition against Russian aggression over time.\n\nIt is clear cyber will now play an integral role in future armed conflict,\n\nsupplementing traditional forms of warfare. We hope this report\n\nserves as a call to action as we prepare for potential future conflicts\n\naround the world. At Google, we are committed to doing our part\n\nto support collective defense and look forward to partnering\n\nwith others to drive continued progress and help organizations,\n\nbusinesses, governments, and users stay safe online.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Section 1\n\n\n##### Government-backed attackers\n\n###### Russian government-backed attackers aggressively pursue wartime advantage in cyberspace\n\nSince the start of the war, Russian government-backed attackers\n\nhave aggressively targeted Ukraine and its supporters, particularly\n\nNATO member countries. Based on analysis from across Google,\n\nwe see a multi-pronged Russian effort to gain a wartime advantage\n\nthrough cyberspace. This effort includes a range of campaigns\n\ndesigned to improve intelligence collection, deploy destructive\n\nattacks against victim networks, and advance active measures\n\nto shape the information environment in Moscow’s favor.\n\n\n###### A note on threat actor naming conventions\n\n\nOur understanding of these groups is based on a\nbody of technical data that includes infrastructure,\nmalware, and the broader set of tactics, techniques,\nand procedures (TTPs) threat actors use in their campaigns. Other analysts may use different methodologies to assess actor activity. There is no single industry standard for naming these actors, but we’ve listed\naliases where our group names align with others.\n\nAttribution to the underlying entity behind the group\noften comes later (if at all) from clues in the technical\ndata and other sources like media and publicly available government documents. It is not uncommon for\n\n\nmultiple actors representing distinct sets of technical\nactivity to eventually be attributed to the same ultimate organization, similar to the attribution we made\nto GRU in this paper (see the threat actor deep dives).\n\nWe use the term “government-backed attacker”\ninstead of the term “advanced persistent threat”\n(APT) to more clearly differentiate these groups\nfrom other financially motivated actors discussed\nlater in the paper.\n\n\n**Russia’s cyber preparations began long before the invasion**\n\nRussian government-backed attackers ramped up cyber operations beginning\n\nin 2021 during the run up to the invasion. This led to a 250% increase in Russian\n\nphishing campaigns directed against users in Ukraine in 2022 (compared to\n\na 2020 baseline). We attribute this increase to two primary factors: (1) some\n\nattackers intensified their traditional focus on Ukraine and (2) others shifted their\n\nfocus towards Ukraine. To help counter these efforts, we disrupted phishing\n\ncampaigns against the Ukrainian government and military organizations,\n\nas well as critical infrastructure, media and the information space.\n\n**Users in NATO countries face intensified targeting**\n\nSince the war began, we’ve seen an over 300% increase in Russian phishing\n\ncampaigns directed against users in NATO countries in 2022 (compared to a 2020\n\nbaseline). These efforts may reflect a longstanding Russian strategic priority\n\nto gather better insight into NATO activities, but in 2022 they were driven primarily\n\nby a Belarusian government-backed group that is closely aligned with Russia.\n\n**Waves of destructive malware hit Ukraine**\n\nRussian Armed Forces’ Main Directorate of the General Staff (GRU) -sponsored\n\nactors have used destructive malware to disrupt and degrade Ukraine’s govern\nment and military capabilities. In parallel, we’ve seen similar attacks on civilian\n\ninfrastructure in an attempt to undermine the public’s trust in the government’s\n\nability to deliver basic services. We observed more destructive cyberattacks\n\nin Ukraine during the first four months of 2022 than in the previous eight years\n\nwith a notable spike in activity at the start of the invasion. In contrast to NotPetya,\n\nwe’ve seen little evidence of a spillover effect outside Ukraine.\n\n**Russia uses cyber operations for multiple strategic objectives**\n\nWe’ve observed a notable uptick in the intensity and frequency of Russian cyber\n\noperations designed to maximize access to victim networks, systems, and data\n\nto achieve multiple strategic objectives. For example, GRU-sponsored actors\n\nhave used their access to steal sensitive information and release it to the public\n\nto further a narrative, or use that same access to conduct destructive cyber\n\nattacks or information operations campaigns.\n\nIn this section, we outline trends in the threat landscape and then dive deeper\n\ninto specific Russian government-backed attackers and their behavior in 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### frozenbarents\n\n**Aliases**\nSandworm\nVoodoo Bear\nIRIDIUM\n\n\n###### frozenlake\n\n**Aliases**\nAPT28\nSOFACY\nFancy Bear\nSTRONTIUM\nSednit\n\n\n###### coldriver\n\n**Aliases**\nGOSSAMER BEAR\nCallisto Group\nSEABORGIUM\nTA446\n\n\n###### pushcha\n\n**Aliases**\nUNC1151\n\n\n###### summit\n\n**Aliases**\nTurla Team\nSnake\nUroburos\nVENOMOUS BEAR\nunc4210\n\n\n###### frozenvista\n\n**Aliases**\nUNC2589\n\n\n\n###### ●\n\n ●\n\n\n\n###### ●\n\n ●\n\n\n\n###### ●\n\n —\n\n\n\n###### ●\n\n ●\n\n\n\n###### ●\n\n —\n\n\n###### Espionage\n\n Information Operations\n\n\n\n###### ●\n\n ●\n\n\n###### Destruction\n\n Targeted nations\n\n\n\n###### ●\n\n—\n\n\nUkraine\n\nNATO countries\n\n\nGeorgia\n\nSouth Korea\n\n\n###### —\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n\nUkraine\n\nNATO countries\n\n\nUkraine\n\nNATO countries\n\n\n\n###### ●\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n\nUkraine\n\nNATO countries\n\n\n###### —\n\n—\n\n\nUkraine\n\nNATO countries\n\n\n###### —\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n\nUkraine\n\nNATO countries\n\n\nRussia\n\nGovernment\n\n\nMilitary and Defense\n\nHigh Tech and Telecom\n\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n\nMiddle East\n\nCentral Asia\n\nGovernment\n\n\nEurope\n\nSouth America\n\n\n###### —\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n—\n\n\nAustralia\n\nSouth America\n\n\nMiddle East\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\n\n—\n\n\nMiddle East\n\nCentral Asia\n\nGovernment\n\n\n###### Primary targets\n\n\nGovernment\n\nMilitary and Defense\n\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n\nMilitary and Defense\n\nEnergy\n\n\nMilitary and Defense\n\nEnergy\n\n\nGovernment\n\nMilitary and Defense\n\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n\nGovernment\n\nMilitary and Defense\n\n\nEnergy\n\nFinancial\n\n\nHigh Tech and Telecom\n\nHigher Education\n\n\nEnergy\n\nHigher Education\n\n\nShipping and Rail\n\n\nFinancial\n\n\nHealthcare\n\nHeavy Industry\n\n\n— —\n\nHeavy Industry\n\n\nFinancial\n\nHeavy Industry\n\n\nHigh Tech and Telecom\n\nHigher Education\n\n\nHigh Tech and Telecom\n\nHigher Education\n\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n—\n\n\nNews Media\n\nNGOs\n\n\nHigher Education\n\nNews Media\n\n\nNGOs\n\n\n—\n\n—\n\n\nNews Media\n\nNGOs\n\n\nNews Media\n\nNGOs\n\n\nNews Media\n\nNGOs\n\n\nShipping and Rail\n\n\nShipping and Rail\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Understanding the  threat landscape\n\nPhishing remains a prominent initial access vector\n\nfor government-backed attackers. Attackers use\n\nthis access to achieve multiple Russian strategic\n\nobjectives, such as intelligence collection, data\n\ndestruction, and information leaks intended\n\nto further Russian national objectives.\n\nFrom 2021-2022, TAG observed government\nbacked attackers conduct phishing campaigns\n\nagainst a series of targets (Figure 1). During that\n\ntime, we saw a steady drumbeat in phishing\n\nattacks. At the same time, we noted several spikes\n\nin activity from large campaigns. In 2022, for\n\nexample, we saw a 250% increase targeting users\n\nin Ukraine and an over 300% increase targeting\n\nusers in NATO countries — both compared to\n\na 2020 baseline. These numbers include Gmail\n\nusers and accounts with a country code top-level\n\ndomain (e.g., @gov.ua).\n\n**Figure 2**\n\n###### top targeted domains\n\n**From 2021 to 2022, Russia targeted over**\n\n**150 military and government entities**\n\n**on the gov.ua and mil.gov.ua domains.**\n\nTargets included Ukrainian military\n\nand diplomatic organizations, as well as\n\ngovernment agencies that manage\n\ncritical infrastructure, civil services\n\nand emergency management.\n\n\n**Figure 1**\n\n###### phishing campaigns by government-backed at tackers\n\n**March 2021** **September – October 2021**\nRussia begins Over 11 days, FROZENLAKE sends\nmassing troops credential phishing emails to over\non the Ukrainian 14K recipients globally\nborder\n\n**February – October 2022**\n\n**April 2021** Multiple Russian groups continue elevated\nPhishing campaigns activity levels\nby FROZENVISTA **February 24, 2022** In the lulls between Russian activity,\ntargeting Ukraine Russia invades Ukraine Belarusian-government backed PUSHCHA\n\nis more active\n\n**January 2022**\nWaves of FROZENVISTA\nphishing targeting Ukraine\n\njan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec\n\n202 1 202 2\n\n\nWe assess that these attacks were all carried out\n\nby Russian government-backed attackers. How\never, in the graphic, we also included information\n\non PUSHCHA, a closely aligned group from Belarus.\n\nThis activity is important to capture because it\n\nwas heavily focused on Ukraine and its neighbors.\n\nFor more information on activity associated with\n\nspecific groups, see the threat actor deep dives.\n\n**In 2022, Russian government-backed attackers**\n\n**targeted users in Ukraine more than any other**\n\n**country. We attribute this to two primary factors:**\n\n(1) some attackers (FROZENBARENTS, FROZENLAKE)\n\nintensified their traditional focus on Ukraine and\n\n(2) others (COLDRIVER) shifted their focus towards\n\nUkraine. While we see Russian government-backed\n\nattackers focus heavily on Ukrainian government\n\nand military entities, the campaigns we disrupted\n\nalso show a strong targeting focus on critical\n\ninfrastructure, utilities and public services, and\n\nthe media and information space (FROZENBARENTS,\n\nFROZENLAKE, COLDRIVER, FROZENvista).\n\n\ntargets\n\n7000\n\n6000\n\n5000\n\n4000\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n\n###### top 10 targets — ukr ainian government and military\n\nMinistry of Defense\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\n\nNational Agency for Civil Service\n\nState Agency of Water Resources\n\nState Border Guard Service\n\nSecurity Service\n\nUkrainian Railways\n\nDnipro City Council\n\nVerkhovna Rada (Parliament)\n\nMinistry of Justice\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500\n\ntargets\n\n\n**.mil.gov.ua**\n**and military-related**\n13.8%\n\n**.gov.ua**\n35.1%\n\n\n**i.ua**\n1.6%\n\n\n**other**\n5.1%\n\n\n**ukr.net**\n10.0%\n\n\n**gmail.com**\n34.3%\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3**\n\n###### government-backed at tacker activit y targeting users in nato countries\n\n summit\n\n0.7%\n\n###### COLDRIVER\n1.4%\n\n###### frozenvista\n2.3%\n\n###### pushcha\n15.5%\n\n###### FROZENLAKE\n77.5%\n\nRussian government-backed attackers have long\n\nprioritized NATO targets, but these attacks have\n\nintensified since the runup to the war. FROZENLAKE,\n\nfor example, launched a massive wave of attacks\n\nagainst NATO targets in September 2021, while\n\nPUSHCHA’s campaigns centered on targets in\n\nPoland and Lithuania in 2022. In addition, groups\n\nlike SUMMIT continue to remain focused on NATO\n\ntargets and others like COLDRIVER have shifted\n\ntheir focus to European militaries.\n\nIn parallel to the phishing campaigns described\n\nabove, we’ve seen attackers use their access\n\nto shape the information environment. For exam\nple, evidence shows that some GRU actors worked\n\ntogether to leak information to hacktivist groups,\n\nand we’ve also observed at least one threat actor\n\n(COLDRIVER) use their access for a hack-and-leak\n\noperation targeting the United Kingdom.\n\n\n###### other\n2.7%\n\nBased on distinct count\nof targets in phishing activity\n\nAt Google, we continue to disrupt campaigns\n\nfrom government-backed attackers.

The NotPetya attack\n\n[in 2017 caused billions of dollars of damage](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-25/)\n\n[globally. As a result, many experts anticipated](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/)\n\nsimilar attacks during the war and that the effects\n\nwould spill over outside Ukraine, which largely\n\ndid not happen in 20221.\n\n**From its incident response work, Mandiant**\n\n**observed more destructive cyberattacks in**\n\n**Ukraine during the first four months of 2022**\n\n**than in the previous eight years with attacks**\n\n**peaking around the start of the invasion.**\n\nWhile Mandiant saw significant activity after\n\nthat period, the pace of attacks slowed and\n\nappeared less coordinated than the initial wave\n\nin February 2022. Destructive attacks often\n\noccurred more quickly after the attacker gained\n\nor regained access, often via compromised\n\nedge infrastructure. Many operations indicated\n\nan attempt by the GRU to balance competing\n\npriorities of access, collection, and disruption\n\nthroughout each phase of activity.\n\n\nPAYWIPE\n\n\nMandiant observed at least six unique wipers with\n\nsome of these having multiple variants. While the\n\ndestructive cyberattacks did achieve significant\n\nwidespread disruption initially in some Ukrainian\n\nnetworks, they were likely not as impactful as pre\nvious Russian cyberattacks in Ukraine. To conduct\n\nthe initial waves of destructive activity, Russian\n\nactors often employed accesses gained months\n\nbefore, which were often lost as the attack was\n\nremediated.

On the same day, Mandiant identified a wiper\n\ntargeting a Ukrainian organization. The malware\n\nwas configured via a scheduled task to execute\n\napproximately three hours before Zelensky was\n\nscheduled to deliver a speech to the US Congress.\n\nIn May 2022, Mandiant observed a Ukrainian local\n\ngovernment organization, which was the target of\n\na destructive wiper attack. In addition to the wiper\n\nattacks, the organization also suffered a data leak\n\nevent during which documents from its network\n\nwere released onto Telegram.\n\n\n##### Cybercrime\n\n###### War has split the loyalties of financially motivated attackers\n\nLines are blurring between financially motivated and government\nbacked attackers in Eastern Europe, with threat actors changing\n\ntheir targeting to align with regional geopolitical interests, and\n\ngovernment-backed attackers adopting some tactics and services\n\nassociated with financially motivated actors.\n\n**Cybercrime splits along political lines**\n\nThe cybercriminal ecosystem has been disrupted with some groups declaring\n\npolitical allegiances, others splitting on geopolitical lines, and prominent\n\noperators shutting down. The taboo against attacking Russia has softened.\n\n**Rapid evolution of TTPs**\n\nRansomware actors increasingly specialize in one part of the attack chain and\n\nrapidly adopt novel TTPs. In some cases, the targets and tactics of financially\n\nmotivated actors look more like those of government-backed attackers.\n\n**Projections of ransomware retaliation largely unrealized**\n\nWe did not see an uptick in reported ransomware attacks against critical\n\ninfrastructure in the US and NATO countries in 2022, as might have been\n\nexpected after declarations early in the conflict and the prior wave of such\n\nattacks in 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe did not see an uptick in reported ransomware\n\nattacks against critical infrastructure in the US\n\nand NATO countries in response to the conflict\n\nin Ukraine, as might have been expected after the\n\ndeclarations of allegiances and of hacktivism early\n\nin the conflict.

Monetizing access to com\npanies or networks is not a new concept, and initial\n\naccess brokers existed long before the uptick of\n\ntargeted ransomware. In recent years, the ecosys\ntem has moved towards specialization, with each\n\nparticipant in the chain focusing on one aspect\n\nand interacting with others as business partners.\n\nWe now see faster experimentation with tech\nniques such as new delivery channels and uncon\nventional file formats to increase the success rate\n\nof ransomware campaigns. Increasingly, financial\nly motivated actors borrow successful techniques\n\nfrom other campaigns. Examples include the mal\nware Zloader and IcedID leveraging malvertising;\n\n\nQakbot and Emotet crafting malicious documents\n\nusing the same document builder service; and\n\nBumblebee and BazarLoader embedding their\n\npayload in ISO files sharing metadata and file\n\nstructure. These overlaps complicate and slow\n\ndefinitive attribution.\n\n**Ransomware continues to be lucrative, but**\n\n**financially motivated threat actors are not**\n\n**immune from geopolitical developments.**\n\nWhile ransomware groups continue to be disrup\ntive, the ecosystem itself has been disrupted\n\nwith some groups declaring political allegiances\n\nand prominent operators shutting down.\n\n\nFor example, the stealer malware Raccoon sus\npended activity after its suspected developer fled\n\nthe Russian invasion of Ukraine, and is waiting\n\nto be extradited to the US for legal prosecution\n\nafter his arrest in the Netherlands. At the time\n\nof the invasion, the prominent Conti ransomware\n\ngroup splintered along political and geographical\n\n[lines. Conti declared its support of Russia, and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomwares-internal-chats-leaked-after-siding-with-russia/)\n\n[threatened to strike the critical infrastructure of](https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-based-ransomware-group-conti-issues-warning-kremlin-foes-2022-02-25/)\n\nnations that took action against Russia. Rather than\n\nan increase in attacks on critical infrastructure,\n\nthe announcement led to internal divisions within\n\n[Conti, leaks of the group’s internal communications](https://www.wired.com/story/conti-ransomware-russia/)\n\n[and source code, and the eventual shut down](https://twitter.com/ransomwarefiles/status/1498086108395360256)\n\nof the group.\n\nIn a shift, there has been an increase in reported\n\nransomware attacks in Russia.

After the invasion,\n\n[hacktivist group NB65 used leaked Conti source](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-contis-leaked-ransomware-to-attack-russian-companies/)\n\n[code to target Russian organizations. NB65 claims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-contis-leaked-ransomware-to-attack-russian-companies/)\n\nlinks to the Anonymous hacktivist collective, which\n\n[conducted an “#OpRussia” campaign, including](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/The-cyber-security-impact-of-Operation-Russia-by-Anonymous)\n\nseveral hack-and-leak operations against Russian\n\n[organizations such as the Russian Central Bank.](https://twitter.com/YourAnonNews/status/1507430355623714820)\n\nIn addition, a loose group of international and\n\n[Ukrainian volunteers dubbed the Ukrainian IT Army](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/ukrainian-it-army)\n\nhave been collaborating with Ukraine's defense\n\n[ministry to defend Ukraine and to target Russian](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/ukrainian-it-army)\n\n[infrastructure and websites.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/05/03/ukraine-it-army-hackers-russia-war/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 12**\n\n###### uac-0098 phishing campaigns targeting ukr aine\n\n**June 19 – 21**\nTAG disrupted a campaign with more\nthan 10,000 spam emails impersonating\nthe State Tax Service of Ukraine\n\n\nkey\n\n\n###### Overlap between financially motivated and government-backed threat actors\n\nTAG also sees tactics closely associated with\n\nfinancially motivated threat actors being deployed\n\nin campaigns with targets typically associated\n\nwith government-backed attackers. In September\n\n[2022, TAG reported on a threat actor whose activi-](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/initial-access-broker-repurposing-techniques-in-targeted-attacks-against-ukraine/)\n\n[ties overlap with CERT-UA’s UAC-0098. UAC-0098](https://cert.gov.ua/article/39609)\n\nis a threat actor that historically delivered the\n\nIcedID banking trojan, leading to human-operated\n\nransomware attacks. We assess some members\n\nof UAC-0098 are former Conti members repurpos\ning their techniques to target Ukraine.\n\nIn early 2022, the attackers shifted their focus\n\nto targeting Ukrainian organizations, the Ukrainian\n\ngovernment, and European humanitarian and\n\nnon-profit organizations. The group’s targeting\n\nwildly varied from European NGOs to less target\ned attacks on Ukrainian government entities,\n\norganizations and individuals. Rather uniquely, the\n\ngroup demonstrates strong interest in breaching\n\nbusinesses operating in the hospitality industry\n\nof Ukraine, going as far as launching multiple\n\ndistinct campaigns against the same hotel chains.\n\nThis overlap of activity is likely to continue\n\nthroughout the conflict. As recently as December\n\n2022, the Ukrainian CERT reported that a tool used\n\n[by the Cuba ransomware access brokers, dubbed](https://cert.gov.ua/article/2394117)\n\n[ROMCOM, was used to target users of the DELTA](https://cert.gov.ua/article/3349703)\n\nmilitary system used by Ukraine’s military.\n\n\ntargets\n\n6000\n\n5000\n\n4000\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n0\n\n\napr may jun jul\n\n202 2\n\n##### Former Conti cyber crime\n\n gang members targeted\n\n Ukrainian public and private\n\n organizations and European\n\n humanitarian and non-profit\n\n organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\n###### In this report, we outlined Russia’s multi-pronged effort to gain a decisive wartime advantage in cyberspace and use information operations to help shape public perception of the war.\n\nWe also discussed the war’s impact on criminal groups and the\n\nscale of cybercrime worldwide. Based on these observations,\n\nwe point to several broader, forward looking assessments for\n\nthe security community for 2023:\n\nWe assess with high confidence that Russian government-backed\n\nattackers will continue to conduct cyber attacks against Ukraine\n\nand NATO partners to further Russian strategic objectives.\n\nWe assess with high confidence that Moscow will increase\n\ndisruptive and destructive attacks in response to developments\n\non the battlefield that fundamentally shift the balance — real\n\nor perceived — towards Ukraine (e.g., troop losses, new foreign\n\ncommitments to provide political or military support, etc.). These\n\nattacks will primarily target Ukraine but increasingly expand\n\nto include NATO partners.\n\nWe assess with moderate confidence that Russia will continue\n\nto increase the pace and scope of information operations to\n\nachieve the objectives described above, particularly as we\n\napproach key moments like international funding, military aid,\n\ndomestic referendums, and more. What’s less clear is whether\n\nthese activities will achieve the desired impact, or simply harden\n\nopposition against Russian aggression over time.\n\n\n###### At Google, we’ll continue to work\n\n around the clock to protect the safety\n\n and security of online users and our\n\n platforms. We’ll also continue to support\n\n organizations before, during, and after \n\n security events. In addition, we’ll\n\n continue to track other threat actors\n\n worldwide to ensure they don’t take\n\n advantage of the security community’s\n\n focus on the war.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### This report includes extensive research from dozens of sources\n\n and comes in print and digital versions.
