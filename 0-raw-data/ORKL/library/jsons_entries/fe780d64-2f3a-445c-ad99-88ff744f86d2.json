At the time, the team consisted of 4 core members and 7 sub-teams, and\nsystematically operated channels and group chats. They claimed that they were APT-C-61,\npromoted provocatively, operated study teams, and recruited team members. However, there\nis no clear evidence that they are related to APT-C-61.\n\n(2022–02–10) Claimed to be APT-C-61 and started full-fledged activities.\n(2022–03–19) Shared the information about a Korean website vulnerability and a list of\n97 websites that may have the same vulnerability in one of the Teng Snake-managed\ngroup chats.\n(2022–04–07) Started selling PII(Personal Identifiable Information) and chemicals, and\nreceiving hacking requests.\n(2022–05–02) A user named, who claimed to be team, uploaded a post on an\nunderground forum titled “South Korean health department invades” that was selling\nAD server privileges from an association.\n\n— The same post was uploaded to the newly opened Code Core Telegram channel on May\n6 and Soaring Snake Twitter account on May 7 and 13.\n\n\n-----\n\n(2022–05–20) Declared the suspension of for-profit activities and shut down Telegram\nchannels including several group chats except one channel.\n\n— Mekimer started using CodecoreSET account on Telegram from this point.\n\n(2022–06–17) Yashma-based has been discovered.\n\n## 1. Abstract\n\nThe Teng Snake team first began opening channels and group chats in October 2021. By\nJune 2022, we have found 7 Telegram channels, 5 group chats, 6 accounts, and a Twitter\naccount Soaring Snake(@scan66322894) believed to be associated with Teng Snake. The\nactivities of the Teng Snake team from Telegram channels and group chats conversation are\nlisted in Figure 1.\n\n## 1.1. Timeline of Teng Snake x Code Core\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Timeline of Teng Snake and Code Core\n\n## 2. Core members of Teng Snake\n\nThe ID of Telegram channels and group chats, which were directly managed by the Teng\nSnake team, were composed in form of APT{2,3 digits}. The full list of Telegram channels\nand group chats can be found in Appendix A.\n\nThe Teng Snake team revealed that the team had 4 core members and mentioned their roles\nas shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Core members of Teng Snake\nWe were able to find information about two of these members.\n\n## 2.1. Mekimer: Head of Teng Snake\n\n**Mekimer is the leader and seems to be the keyman of the Teng Snake team. Most of the**\ncritical information shared in all Teng Snake group chats is forwarding Mekimer’s messages.\nThe vulnerability information of the Korean website was also shared by forwarding a\nMekimer’s message.\n\nWe found 2 blogs that are believed to be managed by Mekimer, in which he listed some of\nhis personal information.\n\nFigure 3. Two blogs of Mekimer\nAccording to the information posted, he is a 21-year-old man and currently resides in\nCambodia.\n\nAt first, we assumed that Mekimer was living in China, but in the group chats, he steadily\nappealed that he was abroad. It is difficult to confirm as there is no proof to back this up.\n\nWe also found that the nickname he used before working as alias Mekimer, anqusec.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Footer of Mekimer’s blog\nBy clicking on the word “回忆”, which means memories, at the bottom of Mekimer’s blog, it is\nredirected to the anqusec blog. The blog posts also show that Mekimer continued to attack\nwebsites in China and other overseas countries. Also, we found articles on how to use\nhacking tools such as Nessus and AWVS, and articles on the use of 1-day vulnerabilities. In\nparticular, he had written articles about the website infiltration periodically, and we also found\nthat he infiltrated a Chinese coin exchange server using log4shell exploit.\n\nAfter the Teng Snake team shut down some of their Telegram channels and group chats,\nMekimer started using the alias, CodecoreSET.\n\n## 2.2. Activity history of anqusec in an underground forum\n\nWe found that Mekimer uploaded three posts on an underground forum using the alias\nanqusec from November 13 to 15, 2021. We assumed that he also participated in the chat of\nthe forum. Mekimer introduced himself as Thunder Domain (or Xunlei domain name) team\nin the following three posts.\n\n(2021–11–13) Official Portal of Kerala Local Government Leaked\n(2021–11–15) Fulbright plan | thunder field | 2021 | data operation\n(2021–11–15) ICAT international technology center of India | Xunlei domain | 2021\n\nFigure 5. Mekimer talked with ATW,\n\n\n-----\n\nMekimer appears to have provoked ATW (Against The West) last year, saying he knew his\nidentity. ATW responded they were still waiting for him to reveal his identity in one of the\nposts published by Mekimer. Mekimer has not yet released ATW’s identity, and we assume\nthat Mekimer did not actually have ATW’s identity and just wanted to get attention or show\noff.\n\n## 2.3. Skull Killer : Pentester of Teng Snake\n\n**Skull Killer is responsible for website penetration, OSINT, and vulnerability discovery in the**\nTeng Snake team. In particular, Skull Killer is emphasized to have a large amount of personal\ninformation, which can be seen from his previous Telegram channel and group chat.\n\nSkull Killer operated one Telegram group chat and one channel. The group chat was opened\nin August 2020, but it began operating in October 2021. Various personal information,\nhacking tools, and vulnerabilities were shared in the group chat and their channels.\n\nOn January 29, 2022, a text file named “韩国_外汇_375224 份_3月.txt” was uploaded to a\nchat room operated by Skull Killer. The file included 375,224 Korean account information,\nand consisted of e-mail, name, phone number, job information, and hashed password.\n\n## 3. Mekimer + Skull Killer + α\n\nOn February 10, 2022, Teng Snake shared a screenshot that contains directories and files\nthey used in the attack which was conducted in 2019, with the analysis report published by\n360 Security about APT-C-61.\n\n[**APT-C-61(腾云蛇) report from 360 Security [link]](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Jpw7TqyPzOy57RAZDQdlWA)\n\nAccording to 360 Security, APT-C-61 group primarily targeted Pakistan and Bangladesh,\nparticularly important sectors such as government, military industry, and research centers.\n\nAPT-C-61 used spear-phishing and social engineering techniques to infiltrate, and DDE to\ndownload malware. The malware that is finally installed on the host is an executable file\npackaged with pyinstaller that executes commands received from the C&C server. Afterward,\nutilities such as 7za.exe and rclone.exe were also downloaded to exfiltrate sensitive files.\n\nTeng Snake group claimed to be APT-C-61 group, but the screenshot they uploaded\ncontained 2 python scripts, one suspected to be a tool. The tool has the same size (3kb) as\nthe publicly available script on Github. Also, a directory that was suspected to be an opensource tool called is also displayed.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Teng Snake claimed to be APT-C-61\nFurthermore, while APT-C-61 used Google Drive and Dropbox, Teng Snake is using Ali\nCloud.\n\nFigure 7. Screenshot of Ali Cloud\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the countries affected by APT-C-61 are located in South Asia, the countries identified\n[in Figure 7 and their tweets are South Korea, Myanmar, Turkey, and Taiwan. It’s an](https://twitter.com/scan66322894)\noverstatement to call them an APT group, as they are carrying out their attacks with very\nobscure purposes.\n\nAs a result, when comparing the information of the APT-C-61 group with the information of\nTeng Snake that has been released so far, it is hard to say that Teng Snake is an APT-C**61 group.**\n\n## 4. Teng Snake started the emerging cyber threat in the real world.\n\n 4.1. Korean website vulnerability shared on a group chat\n\nOn March 19, 2022, a file named “韩国网贷.txt” was uploaded to a group chat along with\nseveral files. The message was a forwarded Mekimer’s message by a user named 雷域 and\nhe is presumed to be the manager of the group chat.\n\nFigure 8. Exploit payload of SQL injection\nIn the overall context, the file appears to be educational material for users in the group chat.\nHacking tools, hacking tips, a vulnerability, and a payload used to attack South Korean\nwebsites were included in the file. It also included a list of websites that showed the\npossibility of vulnerabilities or whether they existed.\n\nThe vulnerability was a SQL injection, and inside the file, there was an exploit payload that\ncould be used for actual attacks, as shown in the picture above.\n\nIn addition, as shown below, we were able to check the precautions and hacking tips to be\ntaken.\n\nUse Nessus or AWVS 13.14 version instead of XRAY when scanning Korean websites\nfor vulnerabilities.\nUse dynamic IP.\nLook at the subdomains of the target website.\n\n\n-----\n\nMany XSS vulnerabilities are found, but few are useful.\nSocial engineering, such as phishing mail, is much more useful to target administrators.\n\nFinally, a list of 97 websites (one duplicated) that can test the forementioned vulnerabilities\nwas also shared, with more than half belonging to the financial and loan industry.\n\nFigure 9. Classification results of shared URLs\nAfter sending the message, the user continued to share hacking tools and vulnerabilities they\nused, such as uDork and CANVAS, in the group chat and kept the group chats highly active.\n\n## 4.2. Start selling PII, databases, and chemicals\n\nAt the end of March, Teng Snake closed some of their Telegram group chats and channels\nand also stopped recruitment. At the time of recruiting, it is estimated that at least 100 people\nwere recruited in each of 3 group chats, so it seems that enough people gathered to stop\nrecruiting people and begin commercial activities.\n\nOn April 7, 2022, Teng Snake posted on their main channel that they started selling the\nfollowing chemicals and would not sell them to China.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Chemicals sold by Teng Snake\nAnd on April 20, 2022, the Teng Snake team announced that they would start receiving\nhacking requests and released their unit price list. The workable contents and unit price are\nas follows.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Workable unit price released by Teng Snake\nAfter they released their unit price, they continuously promoted that they were receiving\nhacking requests on the Telegram channel. However, it seems that they were not paid even\nafter the finish of some requests.\n\nIn addition, they also sold Chinese personal information. Below is a part of the sales items.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. Part of the Chinese PII selling list\nAfter that, on May 2, the suspension of receiving hacking requests and data sales was\nannounced. Some buyers had raised suspicions about the resale of data sold by the Teng\nSnake team, and some clients had not paid. This seems why they have declared a\nshutdown.\n\nFigure 13. Declared suspension of receiving hacking request and data sales\n\n## 4.3. Selling AD server privilege of South Korea health department\n\nOn May 2, 2022, a user by the name of uteus posted on an underground forum titled “South\n**Korean Health Department Invades.” Pointing out he was part of a team called White**\n**Dawn and sold access permission with captured photos of him accessing the AD server**\nbelieved to belong to the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Korea.\n\nThe Teng Snake team introduced themselves as White Dawn only in this post, and later\nintroduced themselves as Soaring Snake (or Snakes) team, as a part of the Code Core\nteam. Currently, Teng Snake’s Mekimer (a.k.a. CorecodeSET) and uteus are believed to be\nin the Code Core team.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. AD server privilege sales post by uteus,\nAs a result of analysis based on the username on the sample photo, it was confirmed that\nthe actual target of the attack was a different association. We presumed that they lack an\nunderstanding of Korea.\n\nIn addition, supplementary profit-generating activities through the distribution of ransomware\nwere not being used at that time.\n\n## 4.4. Who is uteus(uetus)?\n\n**uteus is currently one of the members of the Code Core team and is believed to be**\nresponsible for planning attacks and recruiting team members. He has started activities on\nthe forum since April 15.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. First post of uteus,\nOn April 15, 2022, when he began his activities, he posted about selling an iOS browser\nRCE Zero Day and Twitter Token Zero Day. But he was criticized by other users for not\nproviding grounds for the vulnerabilities.\n\nHe also commented on the article titled “Отключаем Windows Defender (+ UAC Bypass,\n**+ Повышение до уровня SYSTEM)”, asking what passwords were for downloading tools**\nfor Windows EoP.\n\n**cinder, mentioned in “South Korean health department invades,” is the alias he used on**\nanother underground forum. He has started activities on the forum since April 3.\n\nFigure 16. One of the posts by cinder,\n\n\n-----\n\nOn May 22, 2022, a post titled Against-Killnet was posted. He wrote to those who resisted\nKillnet, commenting “Anonymous needs you,” and this suggests that he is related to\nAnonymous.\n\n## 4.5. Recruiting new team members and mentioning NATO\n\nAfter announcing the suspension of receiving hacking requests and personal information\nsales on the Telegram channel, Teng Snake began recruiting new team members on May 7.\nThe difference is that they started to check the hacking skills of the applicants.\n\nFigure 17. Mentioned NATO on Telegram\nThe conditions for joining the Teng Snake team were stated that they should be experienced\n(webshell upload, high-risk vulnerabilities, penetration of internal network nodes) in taking\ncontrol of the internal network of NATO allies.\n\nFigure 18. Mentioned NATO on Twitter\nOn Twitter, they claimed that South Korea’s entry into NATO would cause a new war and that\nthey had already seized confidential data from the Ministry of National Defense. Korea\njoining NATO mentioned here means that Korea has joined the NATO Cooperative Cyber\nDefence Centre of Excellence as a regular member. Through this, it is speculated that Teng\nSnake lacks understanding of this case and just ostensibly mentions it to create the\njustification for attacks on NATO-related countries.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19. Continued to recruit new members\nFrom this point on, May 17, they started receiving new team members who can steal server\nprivileges for non-governmental organizations, military, and third-party supply chains.\n\n## 4.6. Code Core Ransomware Detected\n\nOn June 17, 2022, Code Core Ransomware was uploaded to Virus Total.\n\nThe ransomware was created by the Yashma ransomware builder (a.k.a. Chaos\nransomware builder), and the ransom note was customized to include their team name. For\ninformation on the Chaos ransomware, refer to Appendix D. Based on the use of minor\nYashma ransomware builders rather than other famous RaaS, the Code Core team seems to\nlack expertise in ransomware and the ransomware ecosystem.\n\nFigure 20. Ransom note of Code Core Ransomware\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMost of the attack methods used by the Teng Snake team have not been disclosed, but\nit is estimated that they are mainly focused on cloud and web servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nCurrently, it has been confirmed that Mekimer, the team leader of Teng Snake, has\njoined the Code Core team and is attacking South Korea and NATO countries along\nwith uteus and other team members.\nThe Code Core team is currently developing Yashma-based ransomware, so it is\nexpected to use the ransomware in future attacks.\nGovernment agencies in NATO countries need to continuously monitor their activities.\n\n## Appendix A.
