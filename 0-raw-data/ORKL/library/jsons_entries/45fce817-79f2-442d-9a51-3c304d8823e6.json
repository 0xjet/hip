ESET contributed to the project by providing\ntechnical analysis, statistical information, and known command and control server domain\nnames and IPs.\n\nTrickbot has infested over a million computing devices around the world since late 2016 and\nwe have been tracking its activities since the beginning. In 2020 alone, our automatic\nplatform analyzed more than 125,000 malicious samples and downloaded and decrypted\nmore than 40,000 configuration files used by the different Trickbot modules, giving us an\nexcellent viewpoint of the different C&C servers used by this botnet.\n\n## Trickbot, a long-lasting botnet\n\nTrickbot has been a major nuisance for internet users for a long time. ESET’s first detection\nfor Trickbot was created in late 2016. During these years, Trickbot compromises have been\nreported in a steady manner, making it one of the largest and longest-lived botnets out there.\n[As reported in our Threat Report Q1 2020, Trickbot is one of the most prevalent banking](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ESET_Threat_Report_Q12020.pdf)\nmalware families. As seen in Figure 1, ESET telemetry data shows that this malware strain\nrepresents a threat for internet users globally.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Worldwide Trickbot detections between October 2019 and October 2020_\n\nThroughout its existence, Trickbot malware has been distributed in a number of ways.\nRecently, a chain we observed frequently is Trickbot being dropped on systems already\ncompromised by Emotet, another large botnet. In the past, Trickbot malware was leveraged\nby its operators mostly as a banking trojan, stealing credentials from online bank accounts\nand trying to perform fraudulent transfers.\n\nTrickbot’s modular architecture allows it to perform a vast array of malicious actions using a\nvariety of plugins. It can steal all kinds of credentials from a compromised computer and,\nmore recently, has been observed mostly as a delivery mechanism for more damaging\nattacks, such as ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the oldest plugins developed for the platform allows Trickbot to use [web injects, a](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/10/23/evolution-webinject/)\ntechnique allowing the malware to dynamically change what the user of a compromised\nsystem sees when visiting specific websites. To operate, this plugin relies on configuration\nfiles downloaded by the main module. These contain information about which websites\nshould be modified and how. Figure 2 shows an excerpt of one such decrypted configuration\nfile containing targeted URLs and the malicious C&C URLs the bot should contact upon the\nvictim accessing the targeted URLs.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n\n<dinj>\n\n<lm>https://<targeted URL>/retail/*</lm>\n\n<hl>https://195.123.241[.]63:446/response.php?\ns=1595536873511390&id=f93fXZS6rZ70s42y9uVI</hl>\n\n<pri>100</pri>\n\n<sq>2</sq>\n\n<require_header>*text/html*</require_header>\n\n</dinj>\n\n<dinj>\n\n<lm>https://<targeted URL>/wps/*</lm>\n\n<hl>https://195.123.241[.]63:446/response.php?\ns=1595536873511390&id=IbvDEzyn1zHm5Bqcse2V</hl>\n\n<pri>100</pri>\n\n<sq>2</sq>\n\n<require_header>*text/html*</require_header>\n\n</dinj>\n\n<dinj>\n\n<lm>https://<targeted URL>/ibank/*</lm>\n\n<hl>https://195.123.241[.]63:446/response.php?\ns=1595536873511390&id=4hXQ3ZPSm9OQIKyMQaYZ</hl>\n\n<pri>100</pri>\n\n<sq>2</sq>\n\n<require_header>*text/html*</require_header>\n\n</dinj>\n\n\n_Figure 2. Excerpt of a decrypted dinj configuration file (redacted)_\n\nThrough our monitoring of Trickbot campaigns, we collected tens of thousands of different\nconfiguration files, allowing us to know which websites were targeted by Trickbot’s operators.\nFigure 3 shows the number of websites extracted from configuration files in 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Number of targeted websites in 2020_\n\nThese targeted URLs mostly belong to financial institutions. There is a sharp drop in the\nnumber of targets found in these configuration files starting in March. This coincides with the\nmoment when Trickbot operators dropped the webinject module from the list of default\nplugins downloaded automatically by the main module — this is why we have no data in\nMarch; we had to adjust our processes to maintain visibility on the targeted URLs. This drop\nin number of targets is likely due to the Trickbot gang starting to focus on another means of\nmonetization during that time frame: ransomware.\n\nIn these cases, a Trickbot compromise is first leveraged to perform reconnaissance and\nlateral movement in an organization’s network and then to drop Ryuk ransomware on as\nmany systems as possible. From the data we have collected, it appears that Trickbot’s\n\n\n-----\n\noperators moved from attempting to steal money from bank accounts, to compromising a\nwhole organization with Trickbot and then using it to execute Ryuk and demand a ransom to\nunlock the affected systems.\n\nWe also observed new malware development projects allegedly coming from Trickbot’s\noperators, which might also explain their sudden disinterest in operating Trickbot as a\n[banking trojan. One of these projects is the so-called Anchor project, a platform mostly](https://labs.sentinelone.com/the-deadly-planeswalker-how-the-trickbot-group-united-high-tech-crimeware-apt/)\ngeared towards espionage rather than crimeware. They are also likely involved in the\n[development of the Bazar malware — a loader and backdoor used to deploy malware, such](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/a-bazar-of-tricks-following-team9s-development-cycles)\nas ransomware, and to steal sensitive data from compromised systems.\n\n## Trickbot deep dive\n\nWhat makes Trickbot so versatile is that its functionalities can be greatly extended with\nplugins. Throughout our tracking, we were able to collect and analyze 28 different plugins.\nSome are meant to harvest passwords from browsers, email clients and a variety of\napplications, while others can modify network traffic or self-propagate. Trickbot plugins are\nimplemented as standard Windows DLLs, usually with at least these four distinctive exports:\nStart, Control, Release and FreeBuffer.\n\nInterestingly, some have [Rich headers while some do not. Rich headers are an](https://www.virusbulletin.com/uploads/pdf/magazine/2019/VB2019-Kalnai-Poslusny.pdf)\nundocumented data structure added to all binaries built by Microsoft Visual Studio 97 SP3 or\nlater. They contain information about the development environment where the executable\nwas built. The fact that Rich headers are not always present in plugins — and that when they\nare present, they show different development environments — leads us to believe that these\nplugins were written by different developers.\n\nWe did not observe many different samples of the different plugins once they were\ndeveloped and used in the wild. The ones that changed the most are those containing a\nstatic configuration file embedded in the binary. These static configuration files contain,\namong other things, C&C server information, so it is expected to see these change over\ntime. Figure 4 displays the number of variations we saw for each module we collected\nthrough our botnet tracker platform. Most of the newer modules’ variants come in pairs:\nabout half of the collected modules were 32-bit versions, while the other half were the 64-bit\nversions. In the Appendix you can find a brief description of each of these modules.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Variant count for each Trickbot plugin_\n\n### Configuration files for everyone\n\nAlthough there are potentially many different downloaded configuration files present in a\nTrickbot installation, the main module contains an encrypted, hardcoded configuration. This\ncontains a list of C&C servers as well as a default list of plugins that should be download.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, some plugins also rely on configuration files to operate properly. These\nplugins rely on the main module to download these configuration files from the C&C servers.\nPlugins achieve this by passing a small module configuration structure, stored in the plugin\nbinary’s overlay section, that lets the main module know what it should download.\n\nBeing able to gather these configuration files allowed us to map the network infrastructure of\nTrickbot. The main module uses its list of hardcoded C&C servers and connects to one of\nthem to download a second list of C&C servers the so-called psrv list The main module\n\n\n-----\n\ncontacts this second layer of C&C servers to download the default plugins specified in the\nhardcoded configuration file. Other modules can be downloaded later upon receiving a\ncommand to do so from the Trickbot operators. Some of the plugins, such as the injectDll\nplugin, for example, have their own C&C servers, which contain configuration files. Finally,\nthere are dedicated C&C servers for plugins. The most prevalent of them are so-called dpost\nservers, used to exfiltrate stolen data such as credentials but, as detailed in the Appendix,\nothers exist. All these different layers make the disruption effort more challenging. Figure 5\nillustrates this initial communication process.\n\n_Figure 5. Trickbot network communication process_\n\nWe have been tracking these different C&C servers since early 2017. This knowledge was,\nof course, vital in the disruption effort, since we were able to contribute to mapping the\nnetwork infrastructure used by the malicious actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother interesting artifact we were able to gather through crawling this botnet is the unique\nidentifier present in each Trickbot sample, the so-called gtag. This a string present in the\ninitial hardcoded configuration file identifying different Trickbot campaigns or modes of\n[compromise. For example, the mor campaigns are believed to be Trickbot compromises due](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Emotet+epoch+1+infection+with+Trickbot+gtag+mor84/25752/)\nto Emotet. gtags can also sometimes indicate the target of a campaign. A good example is\nuk03-1, which predominantly targeted financial institutions in the United Kingdom.\n\nFigure 6 presents a timeline of all gtags we extracted from Trickbot configuration files from\nSeptember 2019 to September 2020. Looking at the mor group, we can see the abrupt stop\nof the Emotet campaigns in April 2020. There are also some groups that are used by specific\nmodules. The tot, jim and lib groups are some of the most continuously seen gtags and are\nassociated with the mshare, nworm/mworm and tab modules respectively, according to a\n[recent Unit42 blogpost. As all of these are used for lateral movement, it is not surprising to](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/goodbye-mworm-hello-nworm-trickbot-updates-propagation-module/)\nsee a mostly constant line in their timeline.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. gtags group timeline_\n\n## Closing remarks\n\nTrying to disrupt an elusive threat such as Trickbot is very challenging and complex. It has\nvarious fallback mechanisms and its interconnection with other highly active cybercriminal\nactors in the underground makes the overall operation extremely complex. We will continue\nto track this threat and assess the impact that such actions can have on such a sprawling\nbotnet in the long run.\n\n_Special thanks to Jakub Tomanek, Jozef Dúc, Zoltán Rusnák and
