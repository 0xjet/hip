Our analysis shows that many old\ncampaigns and attacks in the past one year relate to 'Operation SideCopy' by common\nIOCs. The background and analysis in this paper provide complete forensic and useful\ndetails of our current research on the malware in this operation.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n Operation SideCopy is active from early 2019, till date.\n\n This cyber-operation has been only targeting Indian defence forces and armed forces\npersonnel.\n\n Malware modules seen are constantly under development and updated modules are\nreleased after a reconnaissance of victim data.\n\n Actors are keeping track of malware detections and updating modules when detected\nby Anti-Virus solutions.\n\n Almost all CnC Servers belongs to Contabo GmbH and server names are similar to\nmachine names found in the Transparent Tribe report.\n\n This threat actor is misleading the security community by copying TTPs that point at\nSidewinder APT group.\n\n We believe that this threat actor has links with Transparent Tribe APT group.\n\n### Summary\n\nA couple of months ago, Quick Heal’s Next-Gen Behavioural Detection System alerted on\na few processes executing HTA from few non-reputed websites.\n\nWe have made a list of URLs, connected from mshta.exe, across multiple customers:\n\n_hxxps://demo[.]smart-hospital[.]in/uploads/staff_documents/19/Armed-Forces-Spl-Allowance-Order/html/_\n\n_hxxps://demo[.]smart-hospital[.]in/uploads/staff_documents/19/Defence-Production-Policy-2020/html/_\n\n_hxxps://demo[.]smart-hospital[.]in/uploads/staff_documents/19/Images/8534_\n\n_hxxps://demo[.]smart-hospital[.]in/uploads/staff_documents/19/IncidentReport/html/_\n\n_hxxps://demo[.]smart-hospital[.]in/uploads/staff_documents/19/ParaMil-Forces-Spl-Allowance-Order/html/_\n\n_hxxps://demo[.]smart-hospital[.]in/uploads/staff_documents/19/Req-Data/html_\n\n_hxxps://demo[.]smart-hospital[.]in/uploads/staff_documents/19/Sheet_Roll/html_\n\n_hxxps://demo[.]smart-school[.]in/uploads/staff_documents/9/Sheet_Roll/html_\n\n_hxxps://demo[.]smart-school[.]in/uploads/student_documents/12/css/_\n\n_hxxps://drivetoshare[.]com/mod[.]gov[.]in_dod_sites_default_files_Revisedrates/html_\n\n\n### Introduction\n\ndetails of our current research on the malware in this operation.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n Operation SideCopy is active from early 2019, till date.\n\n\npersonnel.\n\n\nreleased after a reconnaissance of victim data.\n\n\nby Anti-Virus solutions.\n\n\nmachine names found in the Transparent Tribe report.\n\n\nSidewinder APT group.\n\n\n\n### Summary\n\na few processes executing HTA from few non-reputed websites.\n\n_hxxps://demo[.]smart-hospital[.]in/uploads/staff_documents/19/_\n\n_hxxps://demo[.]smart-hospital[.]in/uploads/staff_documents/19/_\n\n_hxxps://demo[.]smart-hospital[.]in/uploads/staff_documents/19/Images/8534_\n\n_hxxps://demo[.]smart-hospital[.]in/uploads/staff_documents/19/_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe highlighted ones were sent to targets across Indian defence units and armed forces\nindividuals.\n\nWe started tracking this campaign as it was targeting critical Indian organizations.\n\nTraces of this operation can be tracked from early 2019 till date. Till now, we have\nobserved three infection chain processes.\n\nInitial infection vector in two of the chains was LNK file, that came from a malspam. But in\none case, we saw attackers making use of template injection attack and equation editor\nvulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) as the initial infection vector. Though the initial infection\nvector is different in the third case, the final payload is similar to the first two chains.\n\nBelow images will provide an overview of malware infection in victim machines.\n\n#### Infection Chain – Version 1:\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Infection Chain – Version 2:\n\n Infection Chain – Version 3:\n\n\n#### Infection Chain – Version 2:\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Initial Infection Vector: LNK\n\nThe victim receives LNK files, compressed into ZIP/RAR via emails. These files are\nshortcuts executing mshta.exe and providing remote HTA URL as the parameter. LNKs\nhave a double extension with document icons, to trick the victim into opening the file.\nVictims just have to execute LNK files and rest all modules follow in background.\n\nImage 1: Malicious lnk to launch mshta.exe\n\n#### Initial Infection Vector: Template Injection\n\nImage 2 : Contents of settings.xml.rels\n\n\nImage 2 : Contents of settings.xml.rels\n\n\n#### Initial Infection Vector: LNK\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Decoy Documents/Images:\n\nNames of initial infection LNKs/Documents seems to be quite realistic and lure the victim\ninto opening it. And as the same say, the contents of decoy are related. Some sample\ndecoy that we saw are:\n\nImage 3: Decoy document dropped by “Defence-Production-Policy-2020.docx.lnk”\n\nImage 4: Decoy image dropped by “Image-8534-2020.jpg.lnk”\n\nLooking at first decoy (Image 3), the victim seems to be a target that is interested in Indian\ndefence news.\n\nThe second decoy (Image 4) looks more of a honeytrap image. It is similar to a recent\n[campaign that we uncovered a few months ago.](https://www.seqrite.com/blog/operation-honey-trap-apt36-targets-defense-organizations-in-india/)\n\n\n#### Decoy Documents/Images:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Toolkit for both HTA-Stagers\n\nStage-1 and Stage-2 HTA files seem to be created using CACTUSTORCH toolkit, which is\navailable on GitHub.\n\n_https://github.com/mdsecactivebreach/CACTUSTORCH_\n\n[CactusTorch is inspired by StarFighters and uses the DotNetToJScript tool. It loads and](https://github.com/Cn33liz/StarFighters)\nexecutes malicious .NET assemblies directly from memory. Similar to other fileless attack\ntechniques, DotNetToJScript does not write any part of the malicious .NET assembly on\n[the victim machine. This blog contains good insight into how this toolkit works.](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/cactustorch-fileless-threat-abuses-net-to-infect-victims/)\n\n#### Stage-1 HTA:\n\n**Stage-1 HTA**\n\nMD5 A7C9018A5041F2D839F0EC2AB7657DCF\n\nSHA256 C4A75A64F19BD594B4BB283452D0A98B6E6E86566E24D820BFB7B403E72F84E2\n\nThis HTA file is remotely downloaded via one of the URLs given in summary.\n\nIt has 2 embedded files; a decoy document (can be an image file) and a DotNET module\nnamed ‘hta.dll’. DotNET serialization is used to execute ‘hta.dll’ module.\n\nThe first section in this HTA file checks for installed DotNET version and creates a file at\n‘C:\\ProgramData\\script.js’. This JS file is responsible for restarting victim machine so that\nno traces of running mshta.exe can be found.\n\n|Stage-1 HTA:|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Stage-1 HTA MD5 A7C9018A5041F2D839F0EC2AB7657DCF||\n|SHA256|C4A75A64F19BD594B4BB283452D0A98B6E6E86566E24D820BFB7B403E72F84E2|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second section contains deserialization of DotNET object module to execute decoy\ndocument and download next HTA components.\n\nThe functionality of embedded DotNET module named ‘hta.dll’ can be seen using dnSpy\ntool. Looking at code, we can see that the malware modules are constantly under\ndevelopment.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt executes Decoy file from %temp% folder.\n\nIt then downloads the later stage HTA — next stage HTA is decompressed in the same\nway as decoy document i.e. Base64 + GZip decoding is done to get Stage-2 HTA file.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Stage-2 HTA MD5 18FB04B37C7A6106FB40C5AAFDDD8935|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|SHA256|DD0762FC58ACB30F75B0A2A14DBEF2CCDA553EA9DDE08A180C60CD4113E1A506|\n\n\n**Stage-2 HTA**\n\n\nStage-2 HTA is nearly similar to Stage-1 HTA but has more embedded modules. Stage-2\nHTA again uses DotNET serialization to execute embedded components with file-less\ntechnique.\n\nAt first, it checks for installed DotNET version:\n\nLater it checks for installed Antivirus product and passes all information to serialized\nDotNet module named ‘preBotHta.dll’.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe functionality of ‘preBotHta.dll’ can be seen via dnSpy tool. As we can see, none of the\nfunctions are obfuscated. Similar to ‘hta.dll’, this malware module is also constantly under\ndevelopment as can be seen below.\n\n“preBotHta.dll” during #2019 “preBotHta.dll” during #2020\n\n\n-----\n\nPinkAgain() function checks for available AntiVirus installed at victim machine and saves\nbackdoor module accordingly. These AVs are widespread and popular in India.\n\nOther functionality includes:\n\n Copying “Credwiz.exe” (legit) from system32/SysWOW64 folder to\n“C:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\credwiz.exe”\n\n Drop Object1 from HTA into “C:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\DUser.dll”\n\n Drop and execute BAT file for persistence at “C:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\addreg.bat”\n\n Drop Object2 from HTA into “%temp%\\MicroSoft\\winms.exe”\n\n Execute “Credwiz.exe”\n\nImage 7: credwiz.exe copying code in ‘preBotHta.dll’\n\n\n-----\n\n### BAT module:\n\nBAT file adds registry entry into Run folder. Thus running credwiz.exe on the machine on\nevery startup.\n\nImage: Content of BAT file\n\n#### Script.js file:\n\nThis file is executed via cmd.exe to restart victim machine. Contents of this file are:\n\n\nImage: Content of BAT file\n\n\nvar shell = new ActiveXObject('WScript.Shell');WScript.Sleep(900000);var exec = shell.Exec\n('cmd.exe /k shutdown /r /t 0');exec.StdIn.Close();\n\n\n### BAT module:\n\n\n#### Side-Loading technique:\n\n**credwiz.exe**\n\nMD5 15CF85C3D904A7D8650164B0B831A318\n\nSHA256 17EABFB88A164AA95731F198BD69A7285CC7F64ACD7C289062CD3979A4A2F5BF\n\n“Credwiz.exe” is a legit windows file copied from system32/SysWOW64 folder to\n“C:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\credwiz.exe”.\n\nWhen this file gets executed, it will side-load malicious duser.dll file which is dropped in\nthe same folder.\n\n**DUser.dll** **(version 1)**\n\nMD5 AC4A8D82D91286D5E0F59B85C8975DF8\n\nSHA256 FB761A2DA4841F8739D33A682C5F2F39A033C7BA16430CE5785F7D51AB5D1537\n\nModule ‘DUser.dll’ is embedded as the 1st object into Stage-2 HTA file. The file gets dropped\ninto “C:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\DUser.dll”. It has only 1 export function i.e. “cfileexists”.\n\nAs the names suggsts, its only function is to check for the presence of a file at\n“%temp%\\MicroSoft\\winms.exe” (2nd object dropped from Stage-2 HTA file) and execute it.\n\nIf not found, then it checks for “strcat.txt” at the same location. If it exists, then read the\ncontent of “strcat.txt” and write the content into a file named “winms.exe” as shown in\nbelow fig.\n\n|Side-Loading technique:|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|credwiz.exe MD5 15CF85C3D904A7D8650164B0B831A318||\n|SHA256|17EABFB88A164AA95731F198BD69A7285CC7F64ACD7C289062CD3979A4A2F5BF|\n\n|DUser.dll (version 1) MD5 AC4A8D82D91286D5E0F59B85C8975DF8|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|SHA256|FB761A2DA4841F8739D33A682C5F2F39A033C7BA16430CE5785F7D51AB5D1537|\n\n\n-----\n\nIt will then launch the RAT module “winms.exe”.\n\n\n-----\n\n|DUser.dll (version 2) MD5 B29E7FAC2D84DA758473F3B5E81F3265|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|SHA256|92E9CEEDF28C99F90F8892AEC9D2FA413FF0F4F17C5B0316D05871E95993C3FA|\n\n\nIn a few instances, we saw a completely different version of DUser.dll module. This DLL\nhad an export named as “DllMain”. An interesting PDB string was observed in this file.\n\n\n“F:\\Packers\\CyberLink\\Latest Source\\Multithread Protocol Architecture\\Final Version\\\nDUser\\Release\\x86\\DUser.pdb”\n\n\nAs per the PDB path, DUser was developed in the folder “CyberLink\\Latest\nSource\\Multithread Protocol Architecture”. At this stage, we are not aware of any similar\ntool.\n\nThis Duser.dll will initiate the connection over this IP address ‘173.212.224.110’ over TCP\nport ‘6102’. This IP address & port can be found out in file as it is mentioned in cleartext.\n\nOnce successfully connected, it will try to delete a BAT file from Program Data as can be\nseen in below image and then proceed for performing various operations based on the\ncommand received from C2C.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe commands are numbers from 0 to 15, so it compares each time when it receives the\ncommand from C2.\n\nBased on the commands, it fetches the index value and redirects to specific\nfunction/module to perform the desired operation as shown in below figs.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example if C2 sends 0, then it collects the Computer Name, Username, OS version etc.\nand sends it back to C2.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Backdoor modules:\n\n**winms.exe** **(dropped in Infection Chain - version 1)**\n\nMD5 AF0DD0070C02E15064496853BEFFA331\n\nSHA256 8C6AFF2224FDD54615EF99D32A6134C961B6D7D576B6FF94F6B228EB8AF855AF\n\nThis is a RAT tool and has very high resemblance with code found on below GitHub link.\n\nhttps://github.com/Grampinha/AllaKore_Remote/blob/master/Source/Client/Form_Main.pas\n\nAllakore_Remote is an opensource software written in Delphi.\n\nThe communication happens via 173.249.50.230 over TCP Port 3245.\n\n|Backdoor modules:|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|winms.exe (dropped in Infection Chain - version 1) MD5 AF0DD0070C02E15064496853BEFFA331||\n|SHA256|8C6AFF2224FDD54615EF99D32A6134C961B6D7D576B6FF94F6B228EB8AF855AF|\n\n\n### Backdoor modules:\n\n\n-----\n\n|sihostt.exe MD5 B065FB5E013D4393544E29B4D596C932|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|SHA256|A8D8A56CDA7E29DD64CF28B2BDAD19E8DCBF78E5900CF9CA53F952E9FD2452EB|\n\n\nIn a few attack chains, we saw a DotNET based RAT being dropped in the startup folder by\nmshta process. This previously unseen RAT is used to perform multiple malicious tasks like:\n\n Download and execute files\n\n Upload files\n\n Run process\n\n Delete files\n\n Rename files\n\n Create directory\n\n List directory\n\n Get process info\n\n Kill process\n\n Copy clipboard data\n\n Set clipboard data\n\n Screen capture\n\n ShellExecute command\n\n Exit process\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow figure shows the code start function. This function creates a new object of the class\ncore with two parameters as remote IP and encryption key.\n\nImage 8: Main function\n\nSimilar to other modules, even this module is not obfuscated. Every function has\nmeaningful names and readable code.\n\n\nImage 8: Main function\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 10: Code to download and execute the file.\n\n\n-----\n\n### PDB Paths:\n\n\nInteresting PDB paths were seen in files that we have observed in past one year.\n\nD:\\C\\Proj\\DUser\\Debug\\x86\\hello-world.pdb\n\nD:\\C\\Proj\\preBotHta_new\\preBotHta\\obj\\Debug\\preBotHta.pdb\n\nD:\\Pkgs\\Project\\1-Stagers\\5-DUser\\Debug\\x86\\hello-world.pdb\n\nD:\\Pkgs\\Project\\5-DUser\\Debug\\x86\\hello-world.pdb\n\nD:\\Pkgs\\Project\\Cyrus_HTA1+HTTP_HTA2+VNext_HTA3\\hta\\obj\\Debug\\hta.pdb\n\nE:\\OpenRATs\\NigthFury\\NightFury HTA upload\\preBotHta\\obj\\Debug\\preBotHta.pdb\n\nF:\\Packers\\CoreDll\\DUser\\Release\\x86\\hello-world.pdb\n\nF:\\Packers\\CoreDll\\preBotHta\\preBotHta\\obj\\Release\\preBotHta.pdb\n\nF:\\Packers\\CyberLink\\Latest Source\\Exploit Dropper\\Update or Install\\Dropper\\Release\\Update-Install.pdb\n\nF:\\Packers\\CyberLink\\Latest Source\\Exploit Dropper\\Update or Install\\Dropper\\x64\\Release\\Update-Install.pdb\n\nF:\\Packers\\CyberLink\\Latest Source\\Multithread Protocol Architecture\\Final Version\\DUser\\Release\\x86\\DUser.pdb\n\nE:\\Packers\\CyberLink\\Latest Source\\Multithread Protocol Architecture\\Final Version\\DUser\\Release\\x86\\DUser.pdb\n\nG:\\AT\\Pkgs\\Pkgs\\Project\\3-hta(hta1)_new_path\\hta\\obj\\Debug\\hta.pdb\n\nD:\\Pkgs\\Project\\Standalone_HTA_With_Startup_Path\\Project\\preBotHta\\obj\\Debug\\preBotHta.pdb\n\nBy looking at changes in codes across different versions and changes in PDB paths, we\ncan conclude that this malware is constantly under development. Attackers are updating\ncodes after a reconnaissance of victim environment.\n\nWe believe, this group is using a commercial tool to install the backdoor.\n\nHowever, we do not have any intel on the same. If you have some knowledge about any\nof the above tools, we will be very interested in knowing about it.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Attribution\n\n\nWe constantly work towards profiling attacks of multiple APT actors. Looking at the basic\nflow of the tools, techniques, and procedure (TTPs) in this attack, it simply points towards\nSideWinder APT group.\n\nAll the names for modules like ‘preBotHta.dll’, ‘DUser.dll’ were similar to some of the\nSidewinder attacks. Credwiz.exe was used for side-loading ‘DUser.dll’ and entire infection\nflow was similar. Few of researchers on Twitter and some Chinese organization blogs\nwere also seen attributing this attack to Sidewinder without many details.\n\nSideWinder is an APT group allegedly to work for Indian interest. But this attack was\ntargeting Indian defence organizations and armed forces veterans. So, it makes no sense\n[on this attribution. Lastly, we found just one good blog that considered this attack to be a](https://medium.com/@Sebdraven/copy-cat-of-apt-sidewinder-1893059ca68d)\n“Copy cat of APT Sidewinder”.\n\n#### Hence, not related to the Sidewinder APT group:\n\n1] Sidewinder uses dotNET compiled ‘DUser.dll’ backdoors. But all ‘DUser.dll’ files in this\noperation were compiled in Delphi/VC++.\n\n2] Naming convention of domains and C2 was not similar to Sidewinder which uses\nnames similar to ‘cdn’ in large volumes.\n\n3] All initial modules are open-source, and some are commercial tools. Sidewinder does\nnot heavily rely on open-source tools.\n\n4] ‘perBotHta.dll’ code was completely different from what was seen with Sidewinder files.\n\n5] Sidewinder was never seen targeting India.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis was the reason; we were convinced that this actor is copying Sidewinder TTPs just to\nmislead the community. So, we named this as ‘Operation SideCopy’.\n\nUnderstanding who is behind an attack is usually a priority when the attack is on critical\norganizations. So, it was a crucial component of our investigation. Now, to hunt the real\nactor behind this operation, we started looking towards older samples, file meta, code,\nDomains, IP infrastructure.\n\nThese are all the Command and Control server IP and domains that we saw being used in\nthis operation:\n\nvmi312537[.]contaboserver[.]net\n\n144[.]91[.]91[.]236\n\nvmi296708[.]contaboserver[.]net\n\n144[.]91[.]65[.]100\n\nnewsindia[.]ddns[.]net\n\n164[.]68[.]108[.]22\n\nmfahost[.]ddns[.]net\n\n173[.]249[.]50[.]230\n\nvmi314646[.]contaboserver[.]net\n\n173[.]212[.]224[.]110\n\nvmi192147[.]contaboserver[.]net\n\n167[.]86[.]116[.]39\n\nvmi268056[.]contaboserver[.]net\n\nAlmost all C2 belongs to Contabo GmbH, a hosting provider that seems to be currently\nfavoured by Pakistan based threat actors. Many Crimson RAT, another tool of Transparent\ntribe group, connect to Contabo GmbH.\n\n[Also, in one of the reports by amnesty, transparent tribe actors RAT were found using](https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/ASA3383662018ENGLISH.PDF)\ncomputer name ‘VMI70913’ and the same sample connected to C2 with a domain name of\n‘vmi70913.contabo.host’ by the hosting
