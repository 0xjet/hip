Read More...](https://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/author/paul-roberts)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Conti ransomware group —a.k.a. Wizard Spider; a.k.a. TrickBot; a.k.a Ryuk—is one of\nthe most prolific ransomware gangs around. It is believed to have been active, in various\nincarnations, since about 2016. Just in the last year, Conti is believed to be responsible for\n[high profile attacks, including the city government in Tulsa, Oklahoma and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tulsa-warns-of-data-breach-after-conti-ransomware-leaks-police-citations/) Ireland's Health\nExecutive service in May, 2021.\n\nEven as leading ransomware groups like REvil and Darkside have folded in recent months,\n[Conti is getting renewed attention from cybersecurity experts. The group, CISA warns, has](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-265a)\nbeen linked to more than 1,000 attacks on U.S. and international organizations while “Conti\ncyber threat actors remain active.”\n\n## 2021: A ransomware extinction event?\n\nThe contrast is worth noting. In fact, 2020 and 2021 saw something like a mass extinction\nevent among high profile ransomware gangs and ransomware as a service outfits. There\n[was the digital takedown of infrastructure used by the REvil ransomware group, followed by](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/cyber-command-revil-ransomware/2021/11/03/528e03e6-3517-11ec-9bc4-86107e7b0ab1_story.html)\nthe [arrests of REvil group members by Russian authorities in January, 2022. In May, 2021,](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59998925)\nthe Darkside ransomware group - which is believed to be responsible for the attack on the\n[Colonial Pipeline - said it was ceasing operations as well. That announcement coincided with](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/business/darkside-pipeline-hack.html)\n[a coordinated law enforcement seizure of some of the group’s infrastructure and](https://therecord.media/darkside-ransomware-gang-says-it-lost-control-of-its-servers-money-a-day-after-biden-threat/)\ncryptocurrency from the wallets of some Darkside affiliates. In November, BlackMatter,\n[another ransomware as a service group, said it was shutting down in the face of increased](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1455750066560544769)\nscrutiny from law enforcement.\n\n## Conti thrives amid chaos\n\n\n-----\n\n[Despite this, Conti has been thriving. Why? In our latest episode of the ConversingLabs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-conti-gang-is-still-in-business-despite-its-own-massive-data-leak/)\n[Podcast I sat down with Yelisey Boguslavskiy, a co-founder of the threat intelligence firm](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yelisey-boguslavskiy-214a02bb/)\n[AdvIntel, to talk about Conti’s evolution in recent years, and why the group continues to be](https://www.advintel.io/)\nsuch a potent threat.\n\nAccording to Boguslavskiy, Conti’s continued vitality reflects a long-running practice of tightly\ncontrolled and highly vertical business operations. That runs counter to the predominant\n“ransomware as a service” model of “quantity over quality:\" farming work out to pretty much\nanyone interested in making a buck and counting on a small number of scores from a large\nbase of attacks. “This is something Conti never really followed in their methodology,”\nBoguslavskiy said.\n\nConti’s operations have always been “rigid and organized,” by the standards of the criminal\nransomware underground. “It was run like a strict business unit,” he said. That meant doing a\nlower volume of more targeted attacks, while keeping its network of business and technology\npartners small.\n“Conti established key business alliances with other cybercrime groups to remain\nsuccessful,” said Boguslavskiy. Rather than rely on others to provide tooling, Conti only uses\ntools that they’ve developed or taken control of. “They don’t want to rely on others,” he said.\n\n## Ransomware: It’s strictly business\n\nComing into 2021, as most ransomware gangs were expanding operations, Conti took an\nopposite path: ejecting non-core members and making the organization smaller and more\nhierarchical. They also began rolling up key partners, like the group responsible for the\nTrickBot and Emotet malware - long suppliers to Conti. “They’ve been very deliberate and\npurposeful in their methodology,” Boguslavskiy told me. “It’s not a game. It’s a business.”\n\nThat strategy has proven to be decisive in keeping Conti operating in a new and more hostile\nenvironment for ransomware groups, he said. The last six months has shown that\nransomware outfits that relied on large and diverse ecosystems of suppliers, infrastructure\npartners and affiliates proved easy for governments and law enforcement to disrupt. That\nfact was on display in May, when the Darkside group announced that it lost control of its\n[blog. payment server and CDN (content distribution network), as well as wallets containing](https://therecord.media/darkside-ransomware-gang-says-it-lost-control-of-its-servers-money-a-day-after-biden-threat/)\ncryptocurrency ransoms paid by victims.\n\n## Conti: mind the R&D\n\nOne of the other key differentiators of Conti and ransomware as a service groups is the\ngroup’s ongoing investments in research and development. Conti has consistently invested\nback into its operations as a way to stay a step ahead of the competition (and law\nenforcement). Right now, the group’s R&D is focused in areas like discovering new,\nexploitable vulnerabilities and avenues for attack, Boguslavskiy said.\n\n\n-----\n\nAmong other things, Conti is looking for ways to leverage common and critical flaws like\nLog4j, [Petit Potam and a recent,](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2021/08/03/petitpotam-novel-attack-chain-can-fully-compromise-windows-domains-running-ad-cs/) [critical vulnerability in SonicWall’s SonicOS. The group is](https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/critical-sonicos-vulnerability-affects.html)\nalso working on enhancements to the Emotet botnet and engaging with other ransomware\n[groups, like those that developed the new BlackCat ransomware, to further its activities.](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/blackcat-ransomware)\n\n## Know your adversary\n\nThe key for organizations concerned about ransomware is to not be complacent,\nBoguslavskiy told me. Reports of the demise of ransomware groups, or dissent within Conti’s\n[ranks over business disputes or the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/angry-conti-ransomware-affiliate-leaks-gangs-attack-playbook/) [War in Ukraine shouldn’t prompt organizations to let](https://therecord.media/conti-ransomware-gang-chats-leaked-by-pro-ukraine-member/)\ndown their guard. Conti remains very active and has shown itself to be extremely resilient.\n“Even if they disappear they will come back stronger,” he said.\n\nUnderstanding how Conti is working to compromise victims and how it behaves once it has a\nfoothold within organizations is the key to defending your organization, Boguslavskiy said.\nThese days, that means paying special attention to precursors of Conti, including indicators\nof compromise linked to Emotet.\n\n## Questions?
