As CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch™ threat hunters know\n[firsthand, adversaries can move from initial access to lateral movement in just minutes. This](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/the-myth-of-part-time-threat-hunting-part-1/)\nblog and the real world attack scenario that it describes highlights the essential value that\nhuman security expertise adds to an organization’s security defense and response\ncapabilities beyond the limits of autonomous ML/AI alone.\n\nEarlier this year, OverWatch threat hunters identified the early stages of an intrusion against\na healthcare organization. Fortunately, this customer subscribed to the OverWatch Elite\nservice, which includes a CrowdStrike threat hunting analyst that helps the in-house security\nteam improve response times and drive continuous optimization. This meant an assigned\nthreat response analyst was able to contact the organization personally to alert them of the\nmalicious activity. This allowed the customer to contain the adversary before any significant\nimpact resulted.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis call escalation protocol — a core offering of OverWatch Elite — can prove crucial in\nenabling a timely response to sophisticated hands-on-keyboard activity when every minute\ncounts. This blog outlines the detection and response to the attempted intrusion.\n\n## Tracking and Containing an Intrusion in Real Time\n\nOverWatch discovered an unknown adversary conducting malicious interactive activity on\nmultiple hosts. Using a legitimate administrator account, the adversary gained access to the\ninitial host via a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session. Valid credentials are often widely\navailable through various means and can provide an undetected path into secure networks.\nThe adversary then wrote a series of tools to the compromised host, including PowerTool,\nMimikatz, and a Meterpreter stager payload with the file name `lssass.exe, masquerading`\nas the legitimate Windows executable.\n\nNext, the adversary executed Mimikatz in an attempt to harvest user credentials from the\ninitial host before moving laterally to various hosts using mstsc.exe, a Windows Remote\nDesktop Connection tool. Using an RDP session, the adversary proceeded to log in to two\nadditional remote hosts using yet another account, indicating that they were in possession of\nnumerous sets of valid domain credentials. The adversary was then observed conducting\nhost and network reconnaissance, including the enumeration of additional systems on the\ndomain. Finally, the adversary attempted to use the Windows Task Manager to extract the\ncontents of the LSASS process in a further attempt to harvest credentials, which was\nultimately thwarted by the CrowdStrike Falcon® sensor.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe tailored guidance provided by OverWatch Elite during the customer’s initial onboarding\nensured that the Falcon platform was configured correctly and had appropriate prevention\nsettings turned on, ensuring no endpoint was left unprotected.\n\n### Tactic and Technique Overview\n\n## An Elite Response When Every Minute Matters\n\nAs this malicious activity unfolded, OverWatch threat hunters were watching and quickly\ndetermined that this was malicious hands-on-keyboard activity. The CrowdStrike Threat\nGraphⓇ database contributes to OverWatch’s ability to hunt across over 1 trillion endpoint\nevents each day, enabling threat hunters to quickly surface the most subtle of suspicious or\nmalicious behaviors that could potentially indicate a sophisticated adversary’s presence.\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon validating that the observed activity was malicious, OverWatch triggered multiple\ndetections to the customer’s Falcon console, followed by a detailed notification that was sent\nvia email. This notification contained a comprehensive summary of the event, including the\nindicators of compromise (IOCs) seen during this attack. With this actionable intelligence in\nhand, the organization had the critical context necessary to take immediate action and\ndisrupt the adversary.\n\nDuring working hours, customers are often available to discuss investigations, detections\nand intrusions with OverWatch Elite analysts. Adversaries, however, do not operate strictly\nwithin business hours. In this case, the malicious activity in question was unfolding over the\nweekend — a time when organizations may not be monitoring their queues or mailboxes as\nclosely.\n\nAs a Falcon OverWatch Elite customer, this organization was provided with 60-minute call\nescalation. This core OverWatch Elite feature is critical to ensuring that active hands-on\nkeyboard activity is being responded to by the customer in a timely fashion. If no one in the\ncustomer’s organization confirms they are investigating the critical activity within 60 minutes\nof the email notification, an OverWatch Elite threat response analyst will begin calling a\npredetermined list of individuals at the organization until there is confirmation that someone\nis responding to the incident.\n\nIn this instance, the initial notification went unacknowledged. OverWatch Elite performed a\nrapid assessment of the unfolding situation and deemed rapid escalation was necessary.\nOnce contact was secured, OverWatch Elite briefed the customer, prompting them to contain\nthe compromised hosts before the adversary could achieve the intended objectives.\n\nOverWatch hunts continuously and simultaneously across its customers’ endpoints 24 hours\na day, 365 days a year, providing near real-time notifications of potential threats to\ncustomers. It is equally crucial that defenders are ready to take action following OverWatch\nnotifications. OverWatch Elite’s call escalation protocol ensures that notifications don’t get\nmissed and defensive action can be taken quickly.\n\n## Features Unique to Falcon OverWatch Elite\n\nOverWatch Elite’s core offerings allow customers to build a personalized relationship with\ntheir assigned threat response analyst. Specific service inclusions, such as the call\nescalation protocol highlighted, provide OverWatch Elite customers with added peace of\nmind that adversary activity within their environments can be rapidly disrupted. The tailored\nthreat hunting available to OverWatch Elite customers also allows them to develop,\noperationalize and tune their threat hunting program to meet the needs of their specific\nenvironment, all while giving them access to fast, closed-loop communications.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to the call escalation protocol, the other unique offerings of OverWatch Elite are\n[detailed below.
