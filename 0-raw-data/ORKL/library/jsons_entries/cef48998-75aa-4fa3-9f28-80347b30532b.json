TrickBot has shifted focus\n\nto enterprise environments over the years to incorporate many features from network profiling,\n\nmass data collection, and incorporation of lateral traversal exploits. With this focus shift comes\n\nmassive amounts of infection data; therefore, it makes sense to best utilize this data. You would\n\nnaturally have some infections they care about which are handed off to other teams to perform\n\nother operations such as ransomware, data theft and in the case of the Anchor group, leveraged\n\nPOS attacks.\n\nRecently a security company NTT [9] released an article reporting on a variant of TrickBot using\n\nDNS. This variant is referred to as the ‘Anchor’ variant, and this post aims to delve into the history\n\nand conduct a deeper dive into this variant.\n\nAnchor can be best summarized as a framework of pieces; these pieces allow the actors to leverage\n\nthis framework against their higher profile victims.\n\nSome of these may look familiar to the TrickBot spreader package ‘tabDLL’ analysis before [3,4,5]\n\nas the project appears to be the same. Therefore, it appears as if the same developer is involved\n\nin both TrickBot and Anchor development to some extent.\n\nFor the purposes of this report, we will go over the toolkits and components we believe to be\n\ndirectly associated with Anchor and its later payload deliveries:\n\n- anchorInstaller\n\n- anchorDeInstaller\n\n- AnchorBot\n\n- Bin2hex\n\n- psExecutor\n\n- memoryScraper\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the pieces we have found for this framework can be seen\n\nbelow in the form of PDB paths.\n\n- `D:\\MyProjects\\secondWork\\Anchor\\x64\\Release\\bin2hex.pdb`\n\n- `D:\\MyProjects\\mailCollection\\x64\\Release\\mailCollector.pdb`\n\n- `D:\\MyProjects\\spreader\\Release\\ssExecutor_x86.pdb`\n\n- `D:\\MyProjects\\spreader\\Release\\screenLocker_x64.pdb`\n\n- `\u0007D:\\MyProjects\\secondWork\\Anchor\\Win32\\Release\\anchorDeInstaller_`\n```\n x86.pdb\n\n```\n- `\u0007D:\\MyProjects\\memoryScraper\\Win32\\Release\\memoryScraper\\`\n```\n memoryScraper$.pdb\n\n```\n- `\u0007D:\\MyProjects\\secondWork\\Anchor\\Win32\\Release\\anchorInstaller_`\n```\n x86.pdb\n\n```\n- `D:\\MyProjects\\spreader.v2\\ssWriter\\Release\\ssWriter.pdb`\n\n- \u0007D:\\MyProjects\\secondWork\\psExecutor\\Release\\psExecutor_x86.pdb\n\n- `D:\\MyProjects\\mailCollection\\Release\\sqlFinder.pdb`\n\n- `D:\\MyProjects\\mailCollection\\x64\\Release\\mailFinder_x64.pdb`\n\n- `D:\\MyProjects\\secondWork\\Anchor\\x64\\Release\\testAnchor.pdb`\n\n- `d:\\MyProjects\\spreader.v2\\REXE\\tin_x86.pdb`\n\n#### COMPONENT: ANCHOR INSTALLER\n\nThe first sample of Anchor installer available on VirusTotal was uploaded\n\non July 2018.\n\nFigure 1: In-The-Wild download location\n\n\n-----\n\ninstaller component, and that is basically how they are setup. They have both a 32-bit and a 64-bit\n\nversions on board.\n\nFigure 3: Installer can write 64-bit or 32 bit bot.\n\n\nFigure 2: PDB and strings\n\nThis is the Anchor loader, but it appears to have been built as a test version. These loaders are the\n\n\n-----\n\nThey write the file to disk using ‘net’ as a prefix with random characters behind it.\n\nFigure 4: Installer generates a random name with net prefix.\n\nThen add it in as a service to be executed using a hardcoded service name of ‘netTcpSvc’.\n\nFigure 5: Installer hardcoded service name\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter installing the file, the installer component deletes itself.\n\n\nFigure 6: Installer deletes itself\n\n### COMPONENT: DEINSTALLER\n\nAlong with an AnchorInstaller, there is also a DeInstaller which is designed to delete the\n\nartifacts of the infection and perform a cleanup. The reason this is illuiminating will stand\n\nout once we go over the payloads that have been seen delivered to Anchor infections.\n\n\n-----\n\n### COMPONENT: ANCHORBOT\n\nThe bot code looks partuclarly similar to what you would expect to see with an early\n\nversion of TrickBot or Dyre.\n\n\nFigure 7: Noticeable bot strings\n\nThe checkin and botid generation are similar, but the version used is hardcoded as “1001”.\n\nFigure 8: Bot URI generation\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 09: Bot generating botId\n\n\n-----\n\nA noticeable difference is its use of C2 domains with OpenNIC resolvers.\n\nFigure 10: Hardcoded C2 domain loaded\n\nFigure 11: C2 domain resolved using OpenNIC resolvers\n\n\n-----\n\ncode, ASM code, hexlified text, BMP insertion.\n\nFigure 12: Bin2hex parameters help message\n\nFigure 13: Bin2hex C code output example\n\n\n#### COMPONENT: BIN2HEX\n\nThis program is a command line utility for manipulating a binary file into various forms including C\n\ncode, ASM code, hexlified text, BMP insertion.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### COMPONENT: PSEXECUTOR\n\nA binary designed to detonate a command, judging by the name and\n\nsome of the recovered examples, this is predominantly designed to\n\ndetonate PowerShell commands.\n\nFigure 14 : PsExecutor cmd.exe overview\n\nFigure 15: PsExecutor powershell command\n\nThis is an executable that would allow the actor to execute any\n\nPowerShell command you would want on the system. PowerShell is\n\nsomething these actors tend to favor as well, using all sorts of custom\n\nloaders and available frameworks for further profiling systems including\n\nMeterpreter, CobaltStrike and PowerShell Empire.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ANCHOR PROJECT PAYLOADS\n\n\nThe payloads pushed down to the bots are frequently Meterpreter, PowerShell Empire and\n\nCobaltStrike. These payloads are delivered using a mix of custom utilities like loaders with existing\n\ntools and scripts, which appears to be an effective strategy for these actors.\n\nMeterpreter Loader:\n\nThe crypter layer on this loader had a notable string calling itself “RuntimeCrypter”.\n\nFigure 16: RuntimeCrypter string\n\nThe main block of code inside also utilized some function calls not normally seen.\n\nFigure 17: Start of main code block\n\n\n-----\n\nUltimately, this crypter layer is designed to XOR-decode the next layer, load it into memory and\n\nthen detonate it.\n\nFigure 18: XOR-decoding shellcode\n\n\n-----\n\nThe next layer turns out to be 64-bit Metasploit code for downloading Meterpreter.\n\nFigure 19: Receiving payload in Metasploit shellcode\n\nFigure 20: Metasploit loader shellcode RC4 decrypting payload\n\n\n-----\n\nHere, we saw it being used to deliver another Metasploit stager in ApacheBench tool.\n\nThe Terraloader component has the normal string encoding you would see where it bruteforces\n\nthe key out using known data. It is also a newer version that uses RC4 versus AES to decode the\n\nfile to be delivered.\n\nFigure 21: Loader string decryption\n\nAfter decrypting the file we are left with an ApacheBench executable that’s been hollowed out with\n\nMetasploit loader shellcode, which in turn performs the same flow as the previously discussed one\n\nof TCP connection -> XOR-encoded length and RC4 encrypted payload to be detonated.\n\n\n#### SIGNED TERRALOADER\n\nTerraloader is frequently seen utilized by CobaltGroup but has also been sold to other actor groups.\n\nHere, we saw it being used to deliver another Metasploit stager in ApacheBench tool.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe script turns out to be a simple download and execute PowerShell script:\n\nThe executed DLL allocates a chunk of memory and copies over some\n\n\n#### POWERSHELL TO METASPLOIT\n\nCommand to bot:\n\ndata into it:\n\n\n-----\n\nThat data is then passed to a function along with some hardcoded strings:\n\nFigure 23: Call to function to decrypt data\n\nThis function turns out to be AES, and the previously mentioned strings are the AES key and\n\ninitialization vector.\n\nFigure 24: AES snippet\n\nAfter being decoded, the chunk of data is once again a Metasploit shellcode loader chain with RC4\n\ndecryption of the download from the C2.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### POWERRATANKBA, THE APT NEXUS\n\nPowerRatankba? What does a tool linked to Lazarus have any business doing in a report on\n\nTrickBot? A good question that can not be answered without all the previously mentioned material\n\nin this report. First off, what has been covered thus far? “Anchor” has a bunch of functionality split\n\nacross various pieces in the form of a framework; this framework seems to be primarily focused as\n\nan all-in-one attack framework designed to attack enterprise environments using both custom and\n\nexisting toolage; this framework also includes components that are designed for uninstalling itself\n\nand removing forensic evidence that could indicate it had been on the system.\n\nThese are major revelations because the last part in certain environments could confuse incident\n\nresponse teams when it comes time to explain attribution.\n\nBelow is a recovered command-and-control tasking for a compromised machine to download a\n\nspecific file issued to an infected machine we identified based on our external Anchor group tracking:\n\nThis domain is extremely particular because it was linked to the Chilean Redbanc Intrusion, which\n\nwas attributed to Lazarus [7].\n\nFigure 25: GitHub data related to Lazarus attack\n\nSo suddenly we are left with a number of questions: is Lazarus using TrickBot infections or is this\n\nsimply a case of mistaken identity? Hopefully, this report will raise enough questions to get those\n\nanswers some day.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### MEMSCRAPER, THE FIN NEXUS\n\nThe Memscraper payload is this group’s POS focused payload. It shares\n\nsome similarities with Anchor bot in that they both can use OpenNIC\n\nresolvers with EmerDNS domains; they both have an ‘installer’\n\ncomponent, and also share the code used to generate the random\n\nfilenames for writing to disk is the same.\n\nFigure 26: Memscraper C2 domain on EmerDNS\n\nFigure 27: Memscraper and Anchor installer drop name\n\ngeneration comparison\n\n\n-----\n\nThis POS malware is exactly what it sounds like as it is designed to scrape memory of processes\n\nlooking for credit card data which will then be exfiltrated back to the C2 panel. It comes with\n\nan onboard whitelist of substrings that it will utilize when enumerating the process tree for the\n\nfollowing processes:\n\n- teller\n\n- shop\n\n- store\n\n- retail\n\n- macros\n\n- pos\n\n- processing\n\n- proc\n\n- kiosk\n\n- opss\n\n- directorr\n\n- info\n\n- reception\n\n- kassa\n\n- opos\n\n- chef\n\n- verifon\n\n- infor\n\nFigure 28: Memscraper process tree enumeration\n\n\n-----\n\nAs you can see in the above screenshot, a check has also been placed to blacklist Skype. After\n\nfinding a good process, the memory will then be read using VirtualQueryEx and ReadProcessMemory\n\nbefore being enumerated for possible track data.\n\nFigure 29: Memscraper hunting for possible card data in memory\n\nAfter finding potential card data, the memory will be passed off to a function that will perform luhn\n\nchecking to verify the card number before being POSTed up to the C2.\n\nFigure 30: Memscraper magnetic cards\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 31: Memscraper building URL\n\nFor HTTP based exfiltration, the data post matches exactly what you would see with a normal\n\nTrickBot module exfiltration of data, but the “source” is called “magnetic cards” in the POST. We\n\ncan do a quick comparison with a picture from another researcher’s PCAP [6], which shows “os\n\npasswords” being POSTed up to a TrickBot C2.\n\nFigure 32: TrickBot module data post\n\n\n-----\n\nFor Memscraper data, you would have the card track data in the “data” section and in “source”\n\nwould be “magnetic cards” with “User-Agent: WinHTTP sender/1.0”\n\n--1b36dac2-17f9-440a-80f4-e2049e83484b\n\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"data\"\n\n<card data>\n\n--1b36dac2-17f9-440a-80f4-e2049e83484b\n\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"source\"\n\nmagnetic cards\n\n--1b36dac2-17f9-440a-80f4-e2049e83484b-\nHTTP exfiltration, however, is not the only trick in Memscrapers book. Similar to the previously\n\nmentioned blog on Anchor having a DNS variant, it turns out Memscraper also has a DNS variant.\n\nThe process enumeration and threads are all the same for the DNS variant with the obvious biggest\n\ndifference being the DNS based exfiltration of data.\n\nThe thread responsible for scraping memory builds the data into a report structure.\n\nFigure 33: Memscraper DNS report structure\n\n\n-----\n\nBefore then retrieving a hardcoded filename to store the data in.\n\nFigure 34: Memscraper DNS variant hardcoded filename\n\n\n-----\n\nThe data will be XOR-encoded using an onboard table before being written to the file.\n\nFigure 35: Memscraper DNS variant writing data to file\n\nThis file is monitored by another thread in the process that will read in the data, XOR-decode it,\n\nand then process it to be shipped off. The domain that will be used is hardcoded:\n\nFigure 36: Memscraper DNS variant hardcoded domain name\n\nThen the subdomain is built using some hardcod characters, random bytes, a built-in UUID and the\n\nprevious report data XOR-encoded with 0xAA.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 37: Memscraper DNS building domain for exfiltration\n\n\n-----\n\nPeriods are added, and it confirms to proper specifications for the labels.\n\nFigure 38: Memscraper DNS variant creating proper length labels\n\nThen the request is made and the data is exfiltrated.\n\nFigure 39: Memscraper DNS variant sending off DNS request\n\n\n-----\n\n#### MITIGATION & RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nAnchor:\n\nService netTcpSvc\n\nYara Signature:\n```\nrule crime_win32_memscraper_1\n\n{\n\nmeta:\n\n description = \"Detects Anchor MemScraper malware\"\n\n author = \"Jason Reaves\"\nstrings:\n\n $s1 = {74656c6c6572000073686f700000000073746f7265000000}\n\ncondition:\n\nany of them\n\n}\n\nrule crime_win32_anchor_trick_1\n\n{\n\nmeta:\n\n description = \"Detects Anchor malware\"\n\n author = \"Jason Reaves\"\nstrings:\n\n $s1 = \"D:\\\\Win32.ogw0rm\" nocase\n\n $s2 = \"MyProjects\\\\memoryScraper\" nocase\n\n $s3 = \"\\\\MyProjects\\\\secondWork\\\\Anchor\" nocase\n\n $s4 = \"\\\\MyProjects\\\\secondWork\\\\psExecutor\" nocase\n\n $s5 = \"\\\\MyProjects\\\\mailCollection\" nocase\n\n $s6 = \"\\\\MyProjects\\\\spreader\" nocase\n\ncondition:\n\n any of them\n\n}\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n#### INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE\n\n\nMemscraper:\n\ne54a267e788cc076c870eba0ff16920f9cb49207a034a8b6bfd92abc5a5f7434\n\nd584e868f867c6251e115b7909559da784f25b778192c6a24e49685f80257e4d\n\n\nMemscraper DNS variant:\n\n354936f4265a5e870374a3fe9378cf9a3e7dd45ee4626b971d6b7b0837f4f181\n\n54257aa2394ef87dd510da00e0583b670f3eb43e2eef86be4db69c3432e99abd\n\n\nAnchor Deinstaller:\n\nb288c3b3f5886b1cd7b6600df2b8046f2c0fd17360fb188ecfbcc8f6b7e552a5\n\n\nAnchor Installer:\n\n52a1ca4e65a99f997db0314add8c3b84c6f257844eda73ae6e5debce6abc2bd4\n\n\nAnchor Bot:\n\n6500190bf8253c015700eb071416cbe33a1c8f3b84aeb28b7118a6abe96005e3\n\n\nAnchor DNS variant:\n\n6b1759936993f02df80b330d11c1b12accd53a80b6207cd1defc555e6e4bf57\n\nb02494ffc1dab60510e6caee3c54695e24408e5bfa6621adcd19301cfc18e329\n\nc6d466600371ced9d962594474a4b8b0ccff19adc59dbd2027c10d930afbe282\n\ne49e6f0b194ff7c83ec02b3c2efc 9e746a4b2ba74607a4aad8fbdcdc66baa8dc\n\n\n#### REFERENCES\n\n[1: https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/10/trick-bot-dyrezas-successor/](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/10/trick-bot-dyrezas-successor/)\n\n[2: https://www.fidelissecurity.com/threatgeek/archive/trickbot-we-missed-you-dyre/](https://www.fidelissecurity.com/threatgeek/archive/trickbot-we-missed-you-dyre/)\n\n[3: https://sysopfb.github.io/malware/2018/11/30/TrickBot-worming.html](https://sysopfb.github.io/malware/2018/11/30/TrickBot-worming.html)\n\n[4: \u0007http://reversingminds-blog.logdown.com/posts/7803327-how-different-malware-families-](http://reversingminds-blog.logdown.com/posts/7803327-how-different-malware-families-uses-eternalblue-part-1)\n\n[uses-eternalblue-part-1](http://reversingminds-blog.logdown.com/posts/7803327-how-different-malware-families-uses-eternalblue-part-1)\n\n[5: \u0007https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trickbot-banking-trojan-gets-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trickbot-banking-trojan-gets-screenlocker-component/)\n\n[screenlocker-component/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trickbot-banking-trojan-gets-screenlocker-component/)\n\n[6: http://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2018/05/25/index2.html](http://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2018/05/25/index2.html)\n\n[7: https://norfolkinfosec.com/recent-lazarus-tools/](https://norfolkinfosec.com/recent-lazarus-tools/)\n\n[8: \u0007https://github.com/k-vitali/apt_lazarus_toolkits/blob/master/2019-01-26-lazarus-](https://github.com/k-vitali/apt_lazarus_toolkits/blob/master/2019-01-26-lazarus-toolkits-pakistan.vk.csv)\n\n[toolkits-pakistan.vk.csv](https://github.com/k-vitali/apt_lazarus_toolkits/blob/master/2019-01-26-lazarus-toolkits-pakistan.vk.csv)\n\n[9: \u0007https://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102fsp2/trickbot-variant-anchor-dns-](https://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102fsp2/trickbot-variant-anchor-dns-communicating-over-dns)\n\n[communicating-over-dns](https://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102fsp2/trickbot-variant-anchor-dns-communicating-over-dns)\n\n\n-----\n\n## ABOUT SENTINELLABS\n\nThe missing link in infosec today is not about alerts - it’s about the context of those alerts. What, When, Where,\n\nWhy, How and most importantly - Who. SentinelLabs came to life to solve the gap security practitioners have\n\nbetween autonomously protecting their enterprise assets and understanding the significance and story of\nalerts. Unlike other threat intelligence solutions, SentinelLabs does not focus on sharing what is already public\nknowledge. We focus on new findings that can assist enterprises in staying protected from adversaries. We cover\n\nboth cybercrime and APT (nation-state) while having a voice in the larger community of threat hunters who are\npassionate about a world that is safer for all. In addition to Microsoft operating systems, we also provide coverage\n\n[and guidance on the evolving landscape that lives on Apple and macOS devices. https://labs.sentinelone.com/](https://labs.sentinelone.com/)\n\n\n-----",
