It was carried out by a previously unpublished threat\ngroup we track as DarkHydrus. Based on our telemetry, we were able to uncover additional\nartifacts leading us to believe this adversary group has been in operation with their current\nplaybook since early 2016. This attack diverged from previous attacks we observed from this\ngroup as it involved spear-phishing emails sent to targeted organizations with password\nprotected RAR archive attachments that contained malicious Excel Web Query files (.iqy).\n\n.iqy files are simple text files containing a URL which are opened by default by Excel. Once\nopened, Excel will retrieve whatever object is at the URL inside the file. These files have\nmost recently been found in use by criminals to deliver commodity RATs such as Flawed\nAmmyy. In DarkHydrus's case, the preferred payload retrieved in their previous attacks were\n\n\n-----\n\nexclusively open-source legitimate tools which they abuse for malicious purposes, such as\nMeterpreter and Cobalt Strike. However, in this instance, it appears that this group used a\ncustom PowerShell based payload that we call RogueRobin.\n\nAttack Analysis\nThe actors sent the spear-phishing emails between July 15 and 16. Each of the emails had a\npassword protected RAR archive attached named credential.rar. The body of the message,\nseen in Figure 1 was written in Arabic and asks the recipient to review the document within\nthe archive. The message also includes the password 123456 that is required to open the\nRAR archive. The credential.rar archive contained a malicious .iqy file named credential.iqy.\n\n_Figure 1 Message body in delivery email_\n\nGoogle Translate renders the Arabic message as:\n\nHi\nPlease review and review the attached file\nGratefully\nPassword: 123456\n\nPayload Analysis\nThe credential.iqy is an .iqy file (SHA256:\ncc1966eff7bed11c1faada0bb0ed0c8715404abd936cfa816cef61863a0c1dd6) that contains\nnothing more than the following text string:\nhxxp://micrrosoft[.]net/releasenotes.txt\nMicrosoft Excel natively opens .iqy files and will use the URL in the file to obtain remote data\nto include in the spreadsheets. By default, Excel does not allow the download of data from\nthe remote server, but will ask for the user’s consent by presenting the dialog box in Figure 2:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Excel security notice for .iqy files_\n\nBy enabling this data connection, the user allows Excel to obtain content from the URL in the\n.iqy file. The contents within the releasenotes.txt file (SHA256:\nbf925f340920111b385078f3785f486fff1096fd0847b993892ff1ee3580fa9d) contains the\nfollowing formula that Excel will save to the “A0” cell in the worksheet:\n\nThe formula uses a command prompt to run a PowerShell script that attempts to download\nand execute a second PowerShell script hosted at the URL\nhxxp://micrrosoft[.]net/winupdate.ps1. By default, Excel will not launch the command prompt\napplication, but will do so with the user’s consent via the following dialog box in Figure 3:\n\n_Figure 3 Confirmation of access of remote data_\n\nThe winupdate.ps1 script (SHA256:\n36862f654c3356d2177b5d35a410c78ff9803d1d7d20da0b82e3d69d640e856e) is the main\npayload of this attack that we call RogueRobin. Its developer used the open source InvokeObfuscation tool to obfuscate this PowerShell script, specifically using the COMPRESS\ntechnique offered by Invoke-Obfuscation. The decompressed PowerShell payload has some\nsimilarities to the PowerShell Empire agent, such as the use of a jitter value and commands\nreferred to by job ID, but we do not have conclusive evidence that the author of this tool used\n\n\n-----\n\nEmpire as a basis for their tool.\nBefore carrying out any of its functionality the payload checks to see if it is executing in a\nsandbox. The payload uses WMI queries and checks running processes for evidence that\nthe script may be executing within an analysis environment. The specific sandbox checks\ninclude:\n\nUsing WMI to check BIOS version (SMBIOSBIOSVERSION) for VBOX, bochs, qemu,\nvirtualbox and vm.\nUsing WMI to check the BIOS manufacturer for XEN.\nUsing WMI to check if the total physical memory is less than 2900000000.\nUsing WMI to check if the number of CPU cores is less than or equal to 1.\nEnumerates running processes for \"Wireshark\" and \"Sysinternals\".\n\nIf the payload determines it is not running in a sandbox, it will attempt to install itself to the\nsystem to persistently execute. To install the payload, the script will create a file\n%APPDATA%\\OneDrive.bat and save the following string to it:\npowershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -exec bypass -File \"%APPDATA%\\OneDrive.ps1\"\nThe script then writes a modified copy of itself to %APPDATA%\\OneDrive.ps1, with the code\nthat performs this installation omitted. To persistently execute when the system starts, the\nscript will create the following shortcut in the Windows startup folder, which will run the\nOneDrive.ps1 script each time the user logs in:\n$env:SystemDrive\\Users\\$env:USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start\nMenu\\Programs\\Startup\\OneDrive.lnk\nThe payload itself communicates with its configured command and control (C2) servers\nusing a custom DNS tunneling protocol. The domains configured within this payload are:\n\nAnyconnect[.]stream\nBigip[.]stream\nFortiweb[.]download\nKaspersky[.]science\nmicrotik[.]stream\nowa365[.]bid\nsymanteclive[.]download\nwindowsdefender[.]win\n\nThe DNS tunneling protocol can use multiple different DNS query types to interact with the\nC2 server. The payload has a function it calls early on that tests to see which DNS query\ntypes are able to successfully reach the C2 server. It iterates through a list of types and the\nfirst DNS type to receive a response from the C2 server will be used for all communications\nbetween the payload and the C2 server, which are in the following order (editor's note: AC is\n_not a DNS record type but is a mode where the trojan will perform a request for an A record_\n_requiring ac as a subdomain):_\n\nA\n\n\n-----\n\nAAAA\nAC - (see note above)\nCNAME\nMX\nTXT\nSRV\nSOA\n\nThe payload uses the built-in Windows nslookup application with specific parameters and\nspecially crafted subdomains to communicate with the C2. To establish communications with\nthe C2, the payload will first get a system specific identifier issued by the C2 server. The\ninitial DNS query sent by the payload to obtain the system specific identifier uses the\nfollowing structure, which includes the current process identifier (PID) as the subdomain of\nthe C2 domain:\n<current process id>.<c2 domain>\nThe C2 server will provide the system specific identifier within the answer portion of the DNS\nresponse. Table 1 explains how the payload obtains the system identifier from the C2\nserver’s answer depending on the query type:\n\n**DNS Type** **Description**\n\nA Uses the regular expression '(\\d+)\\-.$Global:domain' to\nget the decimal value from the answer\n\nAAAA The payload will split the IPv6 answer on \":\" take the [0]\nand [1] digits treat them as a hexadecimal value to obtain\nan integer.\n\nAC,CNAME,MX,TXT,SRV,SOA Uses the regular expression 'Address:\\s+\n(\\d+.\\d+.\\d+.\\d+)' and uses the decimal value in the first\noctet of that IPv4 address\n\n_Table 1 Breakdown of query types_\n\nOnce the system identifier is obtained, the payload gathers system specific information and\nsends it to the C2 server. The information gathered is added to a string in the following\nstructure:\n<IP address>|<computer name>|<domain>|<username>|<isAdmin flag>|<hasGarbage flag\nfrom config>|<hasStartup flag from config>|<\"hybrid\" mode flag from config>|<sleep interval\nfrom config>|<jitter value from config>\nThe payload will base64 encode this string and use its DNS tunneling protocol to transmit the\ndata to the C2. The tunneling protocol transmits data by sending a series of DNS queries\nwith the data within the subdomain of the C2 domain. The structure of each of these\noutbound DNS requests is as follows:\n<system ID>-<job ID>-<offset in data><more data flag>-<random length of base64 encoded\n\n\n-----\n\ndata between 30 and 42 characters>.<c2 domain>\nThe payload will look for different responses to these outbound queries depending on the\ntype of DNS request that the payload uses to communicate with the C2. The following shows\nthe specific IP addresses or strings used by the C2 to transmit a success or cancel message\ndepending on the type of DNS query used for C2 communications:\n\n**DNS Type** **Successful** **Cancel**\n\nA,AC 1.1.1.\\d+ 1.2.9.\\d+\n\nAAAA 2a00:: 2200::\n\nCNAME,MX,TXT,SRV,SOA ok cancel\n\nAfter providing system specific information, the payload will Interact with the C2 server to\nobtain commands, which the payload refers to as jobs. The C2 will provide a string that the\npayload will use to determine the command to execute based on its command handler. To\nobtain strings to treat as commands, the payload will issue a series of DNS queries to\nresolve domains with the following structure:\n<system id>-<job ID>-<offset data specific to job>.<c2 domain>\nThe C2 server will provide responses to these queries that contain answers in IPv4 or IPv6\naddresses depending on the type of DNS query the payload uses to communicate with its C2\nserver. The payload will use a specific regular expressions dependent on the type of DNS\nquery was used to obtain the command string, which can be seen in Table 2:\n\n**DNS TYPE** **Regex Pattern**\n\nA Address:\\s+(\\d+.\\d+.\\d+.\\d+)\n\nAC \\d+-\\d+-(\\d+)-([\\w\\d+/=]+)-\\d-.ac.$Global:domain\n\nAAAA Address:\\s+(([a-fA-F0-9]{0,4}:{1,4}[\\w|:]+){1,8})\n\nCNAME,MX,TXT,SRV,SOA (\\d+)-([\\w\\d/=+]{0,})\\-.$Global:domain\n\n_Table 2 Types of responses provided by C2_\n\nThese regular expressions are used to build strings that the payload will then subject to its\ncommand handler. We analyzed the payload to determine the commands available, which\nprovide a variety of remote administration capabilities. The command handle looks for the\nfollowing command strings in Table 3:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n$fileDownload Uploads the contents of a specified file to C2\n\n\n-----\n\n$importModule Adds a specified PowerShell module to the current script\n\n$screenshot Executes the contents of the command, which should be the string\n'$screenshot'. We are not sure if this works, but the command name\nwould suggest it is meant to take a screenshot\n\n$command Runs a PowerShell command and sends the output to the C2\n\nslp:\\d+ Sets the sleep interval between C2 beacons\n\n$testmode Issues DNS queries of A, AAAA, AC, CNAME, MX, TXT, SRV and SOA\ntypes to the C2 servers attempting to determine which DNS query types\nwere successful. This command will automatically set the DNS type to\nuse for actual C2\n\n$showconfig Uploads the current configuration of the payload to the C2\n\nslpx:\\d+ Sets the sleep interval between outbound DNS requests\n\n$fileUpload Downloads contents from the C2 server and writes them to a specified\nfile\n\n_Table 3 Commands available to payload_\n\nCampaign Analysis\nThe following domains are configured within the payload to be used as C2s. Thematically,\neach domain appeared to be attempting to spoof the legitimate domain of an existing\ntechnology provider with an emphasis on security vendors.\n\nAnyconnect[.]stream\nBigip[.]stream\nFortiweb[.]download\nKaspersky[.]science\nmicrotik[.]stream\nowa365[.]bid\nsymanteclive[.]download\nwindowsdefender[.]win\n\nThe listed C2 servers all resolved to IPs belonging to a service provider in China at\n1.2.9.0/24, which is the IP address used by the C2 server to send a cancel communications\nmessage to the end system. These IPs provided insufficient data for additional\ninvestigations. However, each of the listed domains used ns102.kaspersky[.]host and\nns103.kaspersky[.]host as their name servers. Examination of ns102/ns103.kaspersky[.]host\nrevealed that the second level domain kaspersky[.]host was illegitimate and not owned by\nthe legitimate Kaspersky Labs. Passive DNS resolution of kaspersky[.]host revealed two IPs\nof interest, 107.175.150[.]113 and 94.130.88[.]9.\n94.130.88[.]9 showed passive DNS resolutions of two additional domains, 0utlook[.]bid and\n\n\n-----\n\nhotmai1[.]com. It is unknown what these domains may have been used for but based on the\nsimilarity of domain spoofing and sharing an IP, they are likely part of the adversary\ninfrastructure. 107.175.150[.]113 showed one other domain resolution,\n<redacted>.0utl00k[.]net. We were able to link this specific domain as a C2 for another\nweaponized document (SHA256:\nd393349a4ad00902e3d415b622cf27987a0170a786ca3a1f991a521bff645318) containing a\nPowerShell script very similar to the one found in this attack. Examining the second level\ndomain of 0utl00k[.]net revealed another IP of interest, 195.154.41[.]150. This IP contained\ntwo other domain resolutions following the vendor spoofing theme: allexa[.]net and\ncisc0[.]net. Expanding upon cisc0[.]net, we discovered several weaponized documents and\npayloads using this domain as a C2, from mid to late 2017.\n[Open source intelligence provided by ClearSky Security indicates the domain cisc0[.]net is](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ClearSky_cyber_intelligence_report_2017.pdf)\npossibly related to the adversary group known as Copy Kittens. While there are significant\ntactical overlaps such as similarity of techniques used as well as victimology, we were unable\nto uncover significant evidence of relational overlaps. Further information regarding the Copy\n[Kittens adversary can be found in a paper titled Operation Wilted Tulip.](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Operation_Wilted_Tulip.pdf)\nOur own dataset provides a solid grouping of the DarkHydrus group, with significant overlaps\nin C2 infrastructure as well as similarities in weaponized binaries. C2 domains were also left\nonline and reused over an extended amount of time, such as the domain micrrosoft[.]net\nwhich was used in this attack in addition to two other payloads in January 2017 and July\n2017.\nStudying the other samples, we have attributed to DarkHydrus, we are able to ascertain that\nthis adversary has mainly leveraged weaponized Microsoft Office documents using tools\navailable freely or from open source repositories such as Meterpreter, Mimikatz,\nPowerShellEmpire, Veil, and CobaltStrike. The documents generally do not contain malicious\ncode and instead are weaponized to retrieve remote files containing malicious code on\nexecution. Due to the modular nature of the delivery document, available data for analysis for\nthese attacks are dependent upon the operational nature of the C2 server at the time of\nexecution.\n\nConclusion\nThe DarkHydrus group carried out an attack campaign on at least one government agency in\nthe Middle East using malicious .iqy files. The .iqy files take advantage of Excel's willingness\nto download and include the contents from a remote server in a spreadsheet. DarkHydrus\nleveraged this obscure file format to run a command to ultimately install a PowerShell scripts\nto gain backdoor access to the system. The PowerShell backdoor delivered in this current\nattack may have been custom developed by the threat group, however, it is possible that\nDarkHydrus pieced together this tool by using code from legitimate open source tools.\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected by:\n\nThe micrrosoft[.]net domain has had a malicious classification since March 3, 2017.\nAll C2 domains associated with this payload have a command and control\nclassification.\n\n\n-----\n\nTraps provides endpoint protection, as it can block Excel from creating a command\nprompt process.\n[AutoFocus customers may learn more from the DarkHydrus tag](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.DarkHydrus)\n\nIOC\n**Related SHA256 Hashes**\n\n**Payloads**\ncec36e8ed65ac6f250c05b4a17c09f58bb80c19b73169aaf40fa15c8d3a9a6a1\nac7f9c536153780ccbec949f23b86f3d16e3105a5f14bb667df752aa815b0dc4\na547a02eb4fcb8f446da9b50838503de0d46f9bb2fd197c9ff63021243ea6d88\nd428d79f58425d831c2ee0a73f04749715e8c4dd30ccd81d92fe17485e6dfcda\ndd2625388bb2d2b02b6c10d4ee78f68a918b25ddd712a0862bcf92fa64284ffa\nb2571e3b4afbce56da8faa726b726eb465f2e5e5ed74cf3b172b5dd80460ad81\nc8b3d4b6acce6b6655e17255ef7a214651b7fc4e43f9964df24556343393a1a3\nce84b3c7986e6a48ca3171e703e7083e769e9ced1bbdd7edf8f3eab7ce20fd00\n99541ab28fc3328e25723607df4b0d9ea0a1af31b58e2da07eff9f15c4e6565c\n\n**Delivery documents**\nd393349a4ad00902e3d415b622cf27987a0170a786ca3a1f991a521bff645318\n8063c3f134f4413b793dfc05f035b6480aa1636996e8ac4b94646292a5f87fde\n9eac37a5c675cd1750cd50b01fc05085ce0092a19ba97026292a60b11b45bf49\ncf9b2b40ac621aaf3241ff570bd7a238f6402102c29e4fbba3c5ce0cb8bc25f9\n0a3d5b2a8ed60e0d96d5f0d9d6e00cd6ab882863afbb951f10c395a3d991fbc1\n0b1d5e17443f0896c959d22fa15dadcae5ab083a35b3ff6cb48c7f967649ec82\n870c8b29be2b596cc2e33045ec48c80251e668abd736cef9c5449df16cf2d3b8\nff0b59f23630f4a854448b82f1f0cd66bc4b1124a3f49f0aecaca28309673cb0\n01fd7992aa71f4dca3a3766c438fbabe9aea78ca5812ab75b5371b48bd2625e2\n6dcb3492a45a08127f9816a1b9e195de2bb7e0731c4e7168392d0e8068adae7a\n47b8ad55b66cdcd78d972d6df5338b2e32c91af0a666531baf1621d2786e7870\n776c056096f0e73898723c0807269bc299ae3bbd8e9542f0a1cbba0fd3470cb4\ncf7863e023475d695c6f72c471d314b8b1781c6e9087ff4d70118b30205da5f0\ne88045931b9d99511ce71cc94f2e3d1159581e5eb26d4e05146749e1620dc678\n26e641a9149ff86759c317b57229f59ac48c5968846813cafb3c4e87c774e245\nb5cfaac25d87a6e8ebabc918facce491788863f120371c9d00009d78b6a8c350\nad3fd1571277c7ce93dfbd58cee3b3bec84eeaf6bb29a279ecb6a656028f771c\n\n**Related Domains**\nmaccaffe[.]com\ncisc0[.]net\n0utl00k[.]net\nmsdncss[.]com\n0ffice[.]com\n0ffiice[ ]com\n\n\n-----\n\nmicrrosoft[.]net\nanyconnect[.]stream\nbigip[.]stream\nfortiweb[.]download\nkaspersky[.]science\nmicrotik[.]stream\nowa365[.]bid\nsymanteclive[.]download\nwindowsdefender[.]win\nallexa[.]net\nkaspersky[.]host\nhotmai1[.]com\n0utlook[.]bid\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
