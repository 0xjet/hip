Breaches continue while firms invest in cyber security and national governments develop new cyber strategies.\n\n This report discusses trends in the cyber security environment in Southeast Asia from January to June 2015. We will review some recent cases of attempted breaches on companies and governments, and provide an\n\n\n###### update on a group we first identified in 2013 as APT.Nineblog.\n\n Key Findings:\n\n • In the first half of 2015, FireEye\n products helped 29 percent of our customers in Southeast Asia detect malware used by APT groups and other cyber threat actors targeting their networks.\n\n • Countries in the region face\n the risk that territorial disputes, particularly across the South China Sea, will expand into cyber operations.\n\n\n1 For this report we identify Southeast Asia as Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore.\n\n\n-----\n\n### CYBER TRENDS IN\n SOUTHEAST ASIA\n\n\nSoutheast Asia faces numerous unique challenges\nwith regards to cyber security. The region’s\nextraordinary pace of economic development and\ngrowing military expenditures constitute two\nmajor reasons why APT actors target\ngovernments and businesses. APT groups seek to\nobtain intelligence to provide their sponsoring\ngovernment with diplomatic, military, and\neconomic advantages across the negotiating table\nor on the seas.\n\nCountries in the region continue to face the risk\nthat persistent territorial disputes, particularly\nacross the South China Sea, will expand into\ncyber operations. China, the Philippines, Brunei,\nVietnam, Taiwan, and Malaysia all contest\nterritory in the area. These disagreements have\n\n\nlingered for decades in some cases. Rival\ngovernments often employ APT groups to\nconduct cyber espionage to obtain valuable\npolitical or military intelligence. We routinely\nobserve APT groups stealing information that\ndeals with South China Sea disputes and their\neconomic effects from the networks of\ngovernments and companies involved.\n\nDuring the first half of 2015, about 29 percent of\nour customers in Southeast Asia detected malware\nassociated with APT groups.[2] That remains higher\nthan our global average of about 20 percent.\n\n\nThailand and the Philippines are among those\ncountries in Southeast Asia most often targeted with\nmalware associated with APT groups.\n\n\n**Figure 2:**\n\n\n###### Percentage of FireEye customers observed to have been affected by targeted malware (January - June 2015)\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n50% 48%\n\n40%\n\n40% 39% 39% 38%\n\n30% 35% 33% 33%\n\n29%\n\n20%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n\n0%\n\nSoutheast Asia includes customers in Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Indonesia, and Singapore.\n\n|Col1|affected by targeted malware (January - June 2015)|\n|---|---|\n|||\n||50% 48%|\n||40% 39% 39% 38% 35% 33% 33%|\n||29%|\n||20% 20%|\n|||\n\n\nAsia Pacific includes customers across Asia, from India to Australia, Japan to New Zealand.\n\n\n2 We use “malware associated with APT groups” and “APT and targeted malware alerts” interchangeably in this report. The terms refer to malware detected at\n\ncustomer locations that FireEye threat intelligence has characterized as being associated with APT activity. These statistics are generated by customers who\nhave opted to share anonymized data with FireEye.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Most Prevalent Malware in Southeast Asia\nThe top five targeted malware alerts in first half of\n2015 in Southeast Asia were:\n\n- Kaba (aka SOGU)[3]\n\n- LV (aka NJRAT)\n\n- RegSubDat (aka NOISEPACK)\n\n- CANNONFODDER\n\n- Lecna (aka BACKSPACE)\n\n###### APT and Targeted Malware Detections in Southeast Asia January - June 2015\n\n APT and Targeted Malware Detections Globally January - June 2015\n\n3 Additional information on the malware in this section is available in the Appendix.\n\n\nDetections of LV and Kaba constitute over 30\npercent of all APT malware hits in Southeast Asia\nand globally. Kaba is closely associated with\nChina-based cyber threat groups. RegSubDat,\nCANNONFODDER, Lecna, and Backdoor.APT.Page\nare among the top threats detected in Southeast\nAsia, but are not as frequently observed globally.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Southeast Asia’s Leading Industries Attracting APT Malware\nMore than one-third of malware detections\nassociated with APT groups originated from\ncustomers in the Entertainment/Media/Hospitality\nindustry. We have observed at least 12 APT groups\ntarget this industry globally. APT groups likely\ntarget media companies because of their role in\nshaping public opinion. In addition, the sponsors of\nAPT groups often seek early warning about\nreporting that is critical of their government.\n\n\nGovernments in the region continue to be\namong the most targeted by APT malware in\nSoutheast Asia—nearly 25 percent. Many of\nthese could be from rival governments. We\nhave observed at least four APT groups\ntargeting regional or state governments\n(subdivisions internal to a single country) and\nat least 13 APT groups targeting national\ngovernment organizations.\n\n\n**Figure 5:**\n\n\n##### Top Industry Verticals in Southeast Asia by Percentage Share of APT and Targeted Malware in Southeast Asia January - June 2015\n\n40%\n\n35%\n\n35%\n\n30%\n\n25%\n\n25%\n\n20%\n\n15%\n\n16%\n\n10%\n\n\n5%\n\n7% 2% 2%\n\n0%\n\nThese statistics do not account for the number of appliances at a customer site or the number of FireEye customers\nin a given industry.\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||35%||||||||\n||||||||||\n||25%||||||||\n||||||||||\n||16%||||||||\n||12%||||||||\n||7% 2% 2% 2%||||||||\n||||||||||\n\n\n-----\n\n### REGIONAL CASE STUDIES\n\n\n###### Media Companies Subject to\n Spear Phishing\nIn early 2015, suspected China-based cyber\nthreat actors targeted a media firm in Asia and\nattempted to compromise it via a malicious\nphishing email. The email contained an attachment\nthat deployed a MONKEYTILT backdoor.\nThe media company may have been targeted\nbecause it had published commentary supportive\nof an opposition group. The cyber threat group\nmay also have sought information that would help\nauthorities monitor public opinion and gain\nadvanced notice of articles that portrayed the\ngovernment negatively.\n\n###### Targeting Government Organizations Through Foreign Nationals\nIn early 2015, we observed continuous attempts\nby a suspected China-based cyber threat actor to\ncompromise a governmental organization in\nSoutheast Asia with a malicious software\nbackdoor that we call DIRTNAP. Another iteration\nof this campaign also targeted foreign nationals\nworking with the government. The foreign\nnationals received email messages with a\n\n4 Additional information on this malware is available in the Appendix.\n\n5 Additional information on this malware is available in the Appendix.\n\n6 Additional information on this malware is available in the Appendix.\n\n\nMicrosoft Word attachment containing an\nembedded Visual Basic for Applications macro\nthat dropped the DIRTNAP sample once opened.\n\n###### State-Owned Banks in the Crosshairs\nFireEye has observed the CANNONFODDER\nbackdoor being used consistently throughout the\nSoutheast Asia region during the past year. We\nbelieve China-based threat groups use\nCANNONFODDER to collect political and\neconomic intelligence. In early and mid-2015, we\nobserved CANNONFODDER implants beacon\nfrom a Southeast Asian state-owned bank.\nTargeting this bank would provide the threat\nactors insights into the country’s growth priorities\nand likely a competitive edge in business.\n\nIn addition to the bank, we have seen other\ninstances of the malware. In late 2014, we\nidentified CANNONFODDER implants beaconing\nfrom an Asian telecommunications company. In\nmid-2014, we observed cyber threat actors\nsending spear phishing emails with malicious\nattachments to employees of an Asian\ngovernment. Once opened, the attachments\ninstalled the CANNONFODDER implant.\n\n\n-----\n\n### APT.NINEBLOG RETURNS\n\n\nFireEye has been tracking ongoing activity\nassociated with a unique and relatively stealthy\ngroup we first identified in 2013 using the name\n“APT.NineBlog.“ The name NINEBLOG refers to a\nspecific backdoor used by the threat group; some\nversions of the backdoor use the string ‘nineblog’\nin their command and control (CnC) URI path.[7]\n\nWe have observed this group targeting\norganizations primarily in South Asia and the\nMiddle East. The threat group is notable because\nit employs Visual Basic Scripts (VBScripts) as a\nbackdoor, a tactic we do not often observe. The\ngroup can maintain a low profile probably because\nthe VBScripts are small and stealthy in their\nexecution. The NINEBLOG malware is difficult to\ndetect because the VBScripts are encoded and\nthe actors employ SSL network communications.\nWe have observed intermittent activity from this\ngroup since we first identified it in 2013, and we\nsaw a spike in activity during mid-2015.\n\nWe assess that one of the probable targets of the\ngroup’s 2015 campaign is a Southeast Asian\ngovernment, based on the specificity of some of\nthe decoy documents.\n\n#### This article originally appeared in the FireEye Intelligence Center. FIC provides the latest FireEye analysis on threat groups, industry targeting, regional intelligence, and malware in a library of over 1000 products. FireEye customers with access to FIC can also use FIC Analysis Tools to submit IPs/domains, or files for malware analysis against our Intelligence Database.\n\n\n###### Staying Under the Radar\nFrom mid-2013 through mid-2015, FireEye\nobserved this group deploying numerous exploit\ndocuments. The documents were most likely used\nin spear phishing campaigns targeting\norganizations in South Asia. The group primarily\nuses malicious Microsoft Office documents that\nexploit a variety of vulnerabilities (including\nCVE-2012-0158, CVE-2014-1761, and CVE2015-5119, a leaked HackingTeam exploit) to\ndeliver an encoded VBScript backdoor.[8] We only\nobserved this group use the CVE-2015-5119\nexploit after it was made public. This may indicate\nthat the group does not develop or obtain its own\nzero-day exploits, but is opportunistic and capable\nof adapting disclosed exploits for its own use.\n\nWhen an exploit document is opened, it drops a\ndecoy document and executes a small Portable\nExecutable (PE) dropper. The dropper has two\nembedded VBScripts, one of which is encoded.\nThe first script deletes the PE dropper file and\nitself. The second, encoded VBScript is a backdoor\nthat we call NINEBLOG.\n\nWe noticed the decoded VBScript backdoors\nfrom recent activity were nearly identical (with\nsome small changes) to the first NINEBLOG\nvariants we observed in 2013. The minimal code\nchanges may be due to the fact that the encoding\nprovides enough obfuscation to prevent\ndetection, allowing the core functionality of the\nbackdoor to remain the same.\n\nAdditionally, newer variants of the VBScript\ninclude some code enhancements. The differences\nin functionality between the first variant we\nobserved and newer variants can be viewed in the\ntable below.\n\n\n7 Haq, Thoufique and Nart Villeneuve. “The Curious Case of Encoded VB Scripts: APT.NineBlog” 5 August 2013. https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat\nresearch/2013/08/the-curious-case-of-encoded-vb-scripts-apt-nineblog.html.\n\n8 Hacking Team is an Italian software development firm that develops tools – ostensibly sold to governments and law enforcement organizations – that can be\n\nused to remotely monitor victim computers. The company suffered a breach in mid-2015 that resulted in a massive disclosure of sensitive internal\n\n\n-----\n\n|Functionality|First Identified Variant|Newer Variants|\n|---|---|---|\n|Persistence|Scheduled task and autorun key|Startup folder shortcut|\n|Hide|Sets hidden attribute on working directory and subfiles|Sets hidden attribute on working directory|\n|Collect System Information|Gets user name, computer name, and a list of processes|Gets network adapter info, user name, computer name, a list of processes, and the date|\n|Anti-Analysis/Anti-Forensics|None|Exits if running processes found for process monitor, file monitor, wireshark, or windbg.

The use of encrypted SSL traffic makes it extremely difficult to develop\nnetwork-based signatures to detect the malware’s communications.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Lacking Technical Details for Attribution\nThe group responsible for the NINEBLOG\nactivity has used techniques that may indicate a\nslightly higher than average skill level and\noperational security. These include:\n\n- The use of an encoded Visual Basic Script\n\n(NINEBLOG) as a backdoor, as opposed to a\ncompiled PE binary. VBScript is less likely than\na binary executable to be detected as malicious\nby many security products than a binary\nexecutable, and the obfuscation further masks\nthe backdoor’s purpose and functionality.\n\n- The use of a dynamic DNS (DDNS) provider to\n\nregister their CnC domains. The use of DDNS\nallows the group to hide the domains’\nregistration details, and allows them to\ndynamically redirect their CnC communications\nto different IP addresses as needed.\n\n\n\n- The use of SSL for malware CnC\n\ncommunications. The use of SSL for malware\nCnC communications makes it extremely\ndifficult to use network-based signatures to\ndetect malware traffic.\n\n- The ability to identify publicly disclosed\n\nvulnerabilities and adapt them for use. This\nimplies that the group either has some\ndevelopment capability, or has access to\ndevelopers, tools, or forums where they can\nobtain weaponized documents to deploy\ntheir malware.\n\nWe assess that this group may be acting on\nbehalf of a government based on the group’s\nknown targets and the subject matter of their\nphishing lures and decoy documents. However,\nwe do not have enough information at this time\nto assess a possible sponsor.\n\n\n### APPENDIX: DESCRIPTIONS OF TOP MALWARE FAMILIES IDENTIFIED IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND GLOBALLY\n\n|Backdoor.APT.Kaba|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Aliases:|APT.PlugX, SOGU|\n|Summary:|SOGU is a fully featured backdoor used by APT actors that provides them with remote shell access and a custom CnC protocol.|\n|Description:|The malware is a backdoor capable of file upload and download, arbitrary process execution, file system and registry access, service configuration access, remote shell access, and implementing a custom VNC/RDP-like protocol to provide the CnC server with graphical access to the victim system's desktop. This backdoor provides threat actors with SQL database querying capabilities and communicates using HTTP POST requests or custom binary protocols. FireEye has observed threat actors deliver this backdoor through both strategic web compromises and phishing emails. Some phishing emails dropped decoy documents and this backdoor onto the victim system. This backdoor is frequently installed and launched by KORPLUG, a payload launcher that APT groups use.|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Backdoor.APT.LV|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Aliases:|LV, NJRAT, Bladabindi|\n|Summary:|NJRAT is a remote access trojan popular among Middle Eastern threat actors.|\n|Description:|This malware is a publicly available remote access tool (RAT) capable of keystroke logging, credential harvesting, reverse shell access, file uploads and downloads, and file and registry modifications. This RAT also offers threat actors a \"builder\" feature, allowing them to create new variants based on configurations of CnC servers, specified filenames, options to spread via USB, designated campaign names for internal tracking, and other customization options. Additionally, this RAT gathers and sends important information about infected machines to its CnC server, possibly using a custom protocol over port 80, to include NetBIOS name, user, date, locale, and Windows OS name. Traditionally, threat actors that deploy this RAT primarily use websites hosting EXE files to propagate the malware.|\n\n|Backdoor.APT.CANNONFODDER|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Summary:|This backdoor enables threat actors to modify, upload and download files, collect system information and grant command line access to a victim's computer.|\n|Description:|This malware is capable of stealing credentials from Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. The malware can install a keylogger. It is capable of operating in interactive mode to allow the threat actor to perform additional investigation on the compromised system and steal data.|\n\n|Backdoor.APT.Lecna|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Aliases:|BACKSPACE|\n|Summary:|BACKSPACE is a fully featured backdoor used by APT actors that provides threat actors with remote shell access and a HTTP-based CnC protocol.|\n|Description:|BACKSPACE supports commands to read, search, upload, download, and execute files; list and terminate processes; enumerate network resources; execute commands; and establish a reverse shell. Some variants of BACKSPACE are proxy-aware. Some variants may include functionality to attempt to bypass host-based firewalls. BACKSPACE variants typically contain hard-coded version information and use it to support automatic updates to the latest version.|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Backdoor.APT.MONKEYTILT|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Summary:|This backdoor gives attackers the ability to modify, upload and download files, collect system information and grant command line access to a victim's computer.|\n|Description:|This backdoor can download files, execute system commands, list directories, delete files, collect system information, and provide attackers with command line access to the infected host. It will sleep for an hour after executed, most likely as a sandbox evasion tactic.|\n\n|Backdoor.APT.DIRTNAP|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Summary:|This Jscript-based backdoor is used by suspected China-based cyber threat actors and it communicates via Base64-encoded commands.|\n|Description:|This backdoor downloader written in Jscript can download flies and execute commands. It is capable of modifying the compromised system's Internet Explorer settings in the registry to disable protected mode and add the CnC server to the list of trusted sites. This malware starts by sending the victim's IP address, MAC address, hostname, and OS version in a altered Base64 encoded format to the threat actors.|\n\n\nFireEye, Inc. | 1440 McCarthy Blvd. Milpitas, CA 95035 | 408.321.6300 | 877.FIREEYE (347.3393) | info@fireeye.com | www.fireeye.com\n\n© 2015 FireEye, Inc.
