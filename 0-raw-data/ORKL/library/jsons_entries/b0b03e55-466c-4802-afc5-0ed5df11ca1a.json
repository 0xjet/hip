Like its contemporaries, it has gone after critical\ninfrastructure for a higher chance of a getting a payout. What techniques set it apart?\n\nView infographic of \"Ransomware Spotlight: BlackByte\"\n\n\n-----\n\nac yte debuted Ju y 0 ts st yea o act ty ga e ed t e atte t o o t e ede a u eau o est gat o ( ) a d t e US Sec et\n[Service (USS). According to a joint advisory by these two government agencies, BlackByte had already gone after at least three US critical](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220211.pdf)\ninfrastructure sectors (government facilities, financial, and food and agriculture) by November 2021.\n\n[This advisory shows just how BlackByte was actively establishing itself as a new noteworthy ransomware variant. On October 2021, Trustwave](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/my/security/definition/ransomware)\n[released a publicly available decrypter for BlackByte. This however did not stop BlackByte as developers released newer versions that used](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/blackbyte-ransomware-pt-1-in-depth-analysis/)\n[multiple keys and ramped up operations, going as far as to warn their victims against using the available decrypter on their website.](https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/19/blackbyte-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[BlackByte’s emergence could be part of a larger scheme. With the purported shut down of Conti, researchers from AdvIntel surmise that](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/my/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-conti)\n[BlackByte is one of the chief new ransomware variants part of its rebranding.](https://www.advintel.io/post/hydra-with-three-heads-blackbyte-the-future-of-ransomware-subsidiary-groups)\n\nAt present, BlackByte continues to target organizations from all over the world. However, like [LockBit,](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/my/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-lockbit) [RansomEXX, and many other](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/my/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-ransomexx)\nransomware families, BlackByte avoids attacking Russia-based entities.\n\n## What do organizations need to know about BlackByte?\n\nWhile BlackByte operators use their piece of ransomware in attacks for their own gain, they also run on a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)\nmodel for their affiliates. We have listed down the key highlights of BlackByte here:\n\n**Initial versions used symmetric keys. The earlier variant of BlackByte used the same key in each campaign to encrypt files. It also**\nused AES, a symmetric key algorithm. This allowed researchers to create a decrypter to help BlackByte victims, thus forcing the group to\nchange their encryption method in newer variants.\n**It has multiple variants. The first known version of BlackByte was written in C#. Operators then released two Go-based variants. The**\nmore recent Go-variant was introduced around February 2022 and sported modifications particularly in its encryption algorithm.\n**Archives files using WinRAR. In BlackByte campaigns data exfiltration is done before the ransomware is deployed. This is because the**\nBlackByte ransomware is incapable of exfiltrating data, instead it archives files using WinRAR then uploads the file to sharing sites.\n**Uses trojanized** **[legitimate tools. Like most modern ransomware variants, BlackByte uses living-off-the-land binaries. For example, it](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/my/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/locked-loaded-and-in-the-wrong-hands-legitimate-tools-weaponized-for-ransomware-in-2021)**\nuses the remote tool AnyDesk to gain further control over a system and for lateral movement.\n**Involves phishing emails or a known ProxyShell vulnerability for initial access. BlackByte has been known to use phishing emails**\nor exploit unpatched ProxyShell vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Servers to gain initial access into a system.\n\nBlackByte trajectory seems to point to continuing activity. In fact, reports indicate that BlackByte is among the ransomware operations that\n[have set their sights on Latin American governments in May 2022. This report is reflected in our own telemetry data as seen in the next](https://www.recordedfuture.com/latin-american-governments-targeted-by-ransomware)\nsection.\n\n## Top affected industries and countries\n\nThe data used in this section represent the count of unique machines where BlackByte-related activity had been detected. Based on our\ntelemetry data, BlackByte showed a fairly consistent level of activity from October 2021 to March 2022. However, May 2022 detections showed\na drastic uptick in number.\n\nFigure 1. BlackByte monthly unique detections (October 1, 2021 to May 31, 2022)\n\n_Source: Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™_\n\nBased on our telemetry data from April 30, 2021 to May 31, 2022, we detected BlackByte activity all over the globe. However, after the spike in\n[activity in May, Peru outstripped other countries in detection. This is consistent with the reported escalation of ransomware attacks in Latin](https://www.recordedfuture.com/latin-american-governments-targeted-by-ransomware)\nAmerica, where BlackByte was also reportedly among those that targeted the region.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Countries with the highest number of attack attempts for the BlackByte ransomware (April 30, 2021 to May 30, 2022)\n_Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network_\n\nUp to the end of April 2022, the technology sector saw the most BlackByte detections, however, in May, detections in the government sector\nalso shot up.\n\nFigure 3. Countries with the highest number of attack attempts for the BlackByte ransomware (April 30, 2021 to May 30, 2022)\n\n_Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network_\n\nOne way to interpret these observations is that the drastic increase stemmed from a single attack that affected several machines. Aside from\nthe reports on ransomware groups targeting Latin America, this explanation is also based on the report that, by their own claim, BlackByte\noperators had compromised a Peruvian government entity around the time of the increased activity.\n\n## Targeted regions and sectors according to BlackByte leaksite\n\nIn addition to these detections, we delved into BlackByte’s leak site to see the number of attacks recorded there. We looked at data from\nAugust 1, 2021 to May 31, 2022. Based on what we found in the site, BlackByte’s victims were composed mostly of small size businesses. The\nactivity peaked in November 2021.\n\nOverall, the leak site has yet to reflect the focused attack on Latin American governments. The distribution of their attacks per region showed,\ninstead, a proclivity for targeting entities based in North America and Europe.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Regional distribution of BlackByte victims according to the group’s leak site (August 1, 2021 to May 31, 2022)\n\nBased on the leak site data alone, BlackByte operators and their affiliates have yet to show a marked interest in any one sector. We found a\nrelatively even distribution of attacks across industries, which included the following:\n\nConstruction\nMaterials\nHealthcare\nRetail\nTransportation\nEnergy & Utilities\nManufacturing\nProfessional services\nAutomobile\nCommunity\nFoods & Staples\nReal Estate\nGovernment\nIT\nLegal services\nMedia and entertainment\n\nComparing the leak site data of BlackByte to other ransomware families, shows that from January 1, 2022 to May 31, 2022, BlackByte was\namong the 10 ransomware groups with the greatest number of self-reported victims.\n\nFigure 5. Top ransomware groups with the greatest number of listed victims in their respective leak sites (January 1, 2022 to May 31, 2022)\n\nThe data seems to show that BlackByte's operation is beginning to build a name for itself in the threat landscape while still building\nmomentum. The following section shows how it works and how it conducts its attacks.\n\n## Infection chain and techniques\n\nGiven that BlackByte operates on the RaaS model, its infection chain can vary depending on the target.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. BlackByte infection chain\n\n**Initial Access**\n\nBlackByte can arrive in a system by exploiting the ProxyShell vulnerabilities. Exploiting the vulnerable server allows the attacker to create\na web shell to the system which is then used to download and drop Cobeacon using Certutil.\nAfter the initial access into the system, the attackers use Certutil to download and execute the components that it needs to propagate in\nthe network.\nAfter the deployment of Cobeacon, it is then used to execute BlackByte ransomware.\n\n**Discovery and Lateral Movement**\n\nBased on our data, the actors used NetScan as a network discovery tool that allows the attackers to get a good view of the victim’s\nnetwork environment.\nAfter network reconnaissance, the attackers deploy AnyDesk in the system for an additional level of control over the system. The\nattackers repeat this process of discovery and deployment of Cobeacon and AnyDesk until it achieves its goals.\nDuring the execution of BlackByte, it terminates certain processes and services related to security application to evade detection.\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\nOnce the attackers have sufficiently infiltrated into the victim’s network and identified valuable files, it exfiltrates them using WinRar to\narchive the files and upload them into file sharing sites such as anonymfiles[.]com and file[.]io.\n\n**Impact**\n\n\n-----\n\nO ce t e a so a e s e ecuted, t te ates ce ta se ces a d p ocesses e ated to secu ty app cat o to e ade detect o s t a so\nconnects to its C&C server where it looks for a certain PNG file that contains information critical to encryption and is used to derive the\nAES128 key. This key is then protected using an embedded RSA key which will then become undecryptable without the private key. The\nransomware then deletes shadow copies in the system using vssadmin.\n\nFigure 7.

Like many newer\nransomware families, BlackByte is readying itself to take the spot of any big-game ransomware operation in decline. However, underneath it all\ncould be a more intricate scheme of threat groups dispersing under new monikers.\n\nAs with the case of BlackByte, knowing its notable tactics, while also staying knowledgeable of bigger trends can help organizations create an\neffective strategy for ransomware attacks. In the case of BlackByte, prevention is key by keeping employees wary of phishing tactics and\nkeeping up with security patches such as those for ProxyShell vulnerabilities.\n\nTo help defend systems against similar threats, organizations can establish security frameworks that can allocate resources systematically for\nestablishing solid defenses against ransomware.\n\nHere are some best practices that can be included in these frameworks:\n\n**Audit and inventory**\n\nTake an inventory of assets and data\nIdentify authorized and unauthorized devices and software\nMake an audit of event and incident logs\n\n**Configure and monitor**\n\nManage hardware and software configurations\nGrant admin privileges and access only when necessary to an employee’s role\nMonitor network ports, protocols, and services\nActivate security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls and routers\nEstablish a software allowlist that only executes legitimate applications\n\n**Patch and update**\n\nConduct regular vulnerability assessments\nPerform patching or virtual patching for operating systems and applications\nUpdate software and applications to their latest versions\n\n**Protect and recover**\n\n\n-----\n\np e e t data p otect o, bac up, a d eco e y easu es\nEnable multifactor authentication (MFA)\n\n**Secure and defend**\n\nEmploy sandbox analysis to block malicious emails\nDeploy the latest versions of security solutions to all layers of the system, including email, endpoint, web, and network\nDetect early signs of an attack such as the presence of suspicious tools in the system\nUse advanced detection technologies such as those powered by AI and machine learning\n\n**Train and test**\n\nRegularly train and assess employees' security skills\nConduct red-team exercises and penetration tests\n\nA multilayered approach can help organizations guard possible entry points into the system (endpoint, email, web, and network). Security\nsolutions that can detect malicious components and suspicious behavior can also help protect enterprises.\n\n[Trend Micro Vision One™ provides multilayered protection and behavior detection, which helps block questionable behavior and tools](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response.html)\nearly on before the ransomware can do irreversible damage to the system.\n[Trend Micro Cloud One™ Workload Security protects systems against both known and unknown threats that exploit vulnerabilities.
