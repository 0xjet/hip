The threat group is\nfinancially motivated, opportunistic in nature, and so far, appears to target smaller\ncompanies or corporate subsidiaries versus the alternative big game hunting approach.\nBased on intrusion analysis to date, the threat group focuses solely on data exfiltration and\nsubsequent extortion, rather than the more destructive ransomware deployment. In\naddition, Accenture Security assesses with moderate-to-high confidence that the threat\ngroup’s extortion approach includes steps to avoid, as much as possible, drawing attention\nto its activities.\n\n**High level timeline:**\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\nFigure 1. High level Karakurt group website timeline\n<<< End >>>\n\n\n-----\n\nKarakurt[.]group and karakurt[.]tech – registered on June 5th, 2021.\nTwitter handle karakurtlair – created in August 2021.\nKarakurt known to be operational as early as September 2021, which is when\ncomponents on its name and shame site were updated.\nFirst known victim based on Accenture Security’s collection sources and intrusion\nanalysis – September 2021.\nFirst victim revealed on karakurt[.]group on November 17, 2021.\nFirst update to karakurt[.]group “News” page, with volumes 1 – 3 of the threat group’s\n“Autumn Data Leak Digest” on November 19, 2021.\nThe fourth installment of “Autumn Data Leak Digest”, released on November 22,\n**2021.**\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2.

Karakurt[.] group \"About\" page\n\n<<< End >>>\n\n**Victimology**\n\nBased on our collection sources, Accenture Security is currently aware of over 40 victims\nspanning multiple industry verticals and size. The Karakurt group does not appear to focus\non a specific industry vertical or size. Of known victims, 95% are based in North America\nwith the remaining 5% in Europe. From our investigations into the group’s activity, we\n\n\n-----\n\ndetermined that it typically uses credential access as the initial vector into victims networks\nand utilizes applications already installed to move laterally and exfiltrate data, if available. In\naddition, the threat group will typically contact the victim multiple times, using different\ncommunication methods, to apply additional pressure during extortion attempts. Figure 5\nincludes the known impacted industry verticals to date, based on Accenture Security’s\ncollection sources.\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\nFigure 5. Victim Verticals\n\n<<< End >>>\n\n**Compromise activity & detection opportunities**\n\n**Initial access**\n\nThe primary method for initial access into victim networks includes internet-facing systems\nvia virtual private network (VPN) using legitimate credentials. Due to a lack of forensic\nevidence, it is unclear how the credentials were obtained by the threat group. One\npossibility is exploitation of vulnerable VPN devices, but all cases included inconsistent or\nabsent enforcement of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user accounts.\n\nIn Table 1 below, Accenture Security noted logons from four different hosting providers, to\ninclude the autonomous system that currently hosts the Karakurt group’s blog site.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Login time** **Autonomous system**\n\n2021-10-12 07:24:45 RELIABLESITE\n\n2021-09-28 04:22:54 Datasource AG\n\n2021-09-28 03:50:08 DEDIPATH-LLC\n\n2021-09-27 03:41:05 DEDIPATH-LLC\n\n2021-09-23 04:42:20 Clouvider Limited\n\n**Persistence**\n\nThe use of legitimate credentials, service creation, remote management software and\ndistribution of command and control (C2) beacons across victim environments using Cobalt\nStrike are the predominant approaches used by the threat group to further its foothold and\nmaintain persistence.\n\nHowever, in recent intrusions, the threat group did not deploy backup persistence using\nCobalt Strike. Instead, it persisted within the victim’s network via the VPN IP pool or\ninstalled AnyDesk to allow external remote access to compromised devices. The group was\nthen able to leverage previously obtained user, service, and administrator credentials to\nmove laterally and take action on objectives.\n\n**Privilege escalation**\n\nAccenture Security observed the threat group leveraging Mimikatz in at least one intrusion\nset, as well as PowerShell to dump ntds.dit and exfiltrate it for offline analysis.\n\nHowever, the threat group appears to escalate privileges using the aforementioned\ntechniques and tools only if needed, typically using previously obtained credentials.\n\n**Defense evasion**\n\nUsing valid credentials, pre-existing “living off the land” tools and techniques and remote\nmanagement software has enabled the threat group to further evade defenses.\n\nIn one intrusion, Accenture Security also observed the threat group avoiding the use of\ncommon post-exploitation tools or commodity malware in favor of credential access. This\napproach enabled it to evade detection and bypass security tools such as common\nendpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.\n\n**Discovery**\n\nIf the threat group’s preferred tools are not present within victims’ networks, it will download\ncommon remote management and file transfer utilities via a browser to support subsequent\nexfiltration activities (e.g., AnyDesk, FileZilla, 7zip, etc.).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat group was also observed running internet speed tests via a browser to check for\nupload speeds before executing exfiltration activities. In addition, the use of Angry IP\nScanner was identified in at least one intrusion set.\n\n**Lateral movement**\n\nThe threat group has been known to use AnyDesk, or other available remote management\ntools, remote desktop protocol (RDP), Cobalt Strike, PowerShell commands and valid\ncredentials taken from initial access to move laterally.\n\n**Command and control**\n\nIn addition to using valid credentials to log into the VPN directly, the threat group has\nutilized Cobalt Strike for C2 for backup persistence, if needed.\n\n**Exfiltration and impact**\n\nThe threat group has been seen utilizing 7zip and WinZip for compression, as well as\nRclone or FileZilla (SFTP) for staging and final exfiltration to Mega.io cloud storage.\n\nThe staging directories utilized for exfiltration were C:\\Perflogs and C:\\Recovery.\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n[Ransomware response and recovery](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/security/ransomware-response-recovery)\n\n[READ MORE](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/security/ransomware-response-recovery)\n\n<<< End >>>\n\n**Suggested mitigations**\n\nEmploy robust and routine user-awareness and training regimens for users of all\nsystems.\nEnsure that a robust crisis management and incident response plan are in place in the\nevent of a high impact intrusion.\nMaintain best practices against malware, such as patching, updating anti-virus\nsoftware, implementing strict network egress policies, and using application\nwhitelisting where feasible.\nPatch infrastructure to the highest available level, as threat actors are often better\nable to exploit older systems with existing vulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\nEnsure all internet-facing security and remote access appliances are patched to the\nlatest versions.\nDisable RDP on external-facing devices and restrict workstation-to-workstation RDP\nconnections.\nEmploy a strong corporate password policy that includes industry standards for\npassword length, complexity, and expiration dates for both human and non-human\naccounts.\nUse MFA where possible for authenticating corporate accounts to include remote\naccess mechanisms and security tools. Admin accounts should be cross-platform\nMFA enforced.\nUse admin accounts only for administrative purposes and never to connect to the\nnetwork or browse the internet.\nDo not store unprotected credentials in files and scripts on shared locations.\nDeploy EDR across the environment, targeting at least 90% coverage of endpoint and\nworkload visibility.\nEncrypt data at rest where possible and protect related keys and technology.\nHunt for attacker TTPs, including common “living off the land” techniques, to\nproactively detect and respond to a cyber-attack and mitigate its impact.\n\n**[MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)**\n\n**Tactics and techniques observed**\n\n**Tactic** **Technique**\n\nInitial access T1133: External Remote Services\n\nT1078: Valid Accounts\n\nExecution T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter\n\nT1086: PowerShell\n\nT1035: Service Execution\n\nPersistence T1078: Valid Accounts\nT1050: New Service\n\nPrivilege escalation T1078: Valid Accounts\n\nDefense Evasion T1078: Valid Accounts\nT1036: Masquerading\n\nT1027: Obfuscated Files or Information\n\nCredential Access T1110: Brute Force\n\nT1003: Credential Dumping\n\n\n-----\n\nDiscovery T1083: File and Directory Discovery\n\nT1082: System Information Discovery\n\nT1087: Account Discovery\n\nT1135: Network Share Discovery\n\nT1069: Permission Groups Discovery\n\nT1018: Remote System Discovery\n\nT1016: System Network Configuration Discovery\n\nLateral Movement T1076: Remote Desktop Protocol\n\nT1028: Windows Remote Management\n\nCollection T1005: Data from Local System\n\nT1039: Data from Network Shared Drive\n\nCommand & Control T1043: Commonly Used Port\n\nT1105: Remote File Copy\n\nT1071: Standard Application Layer Protocol\n\nExfiltration T1002: Data Compressed\n\nT1048: Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\n\nImpact T1489: Service Stop\n\nIf you have an incident or need additional information on ways to prevent, detect, respond\nto, or recover from, cyberthreats, contact a member of our CIFR team 24/7/365 by phone\n[888-RISK-411 or email CIFR.hotline@accenture.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:CIFR.hotline@accenture.com)\n\n**Accenture Security**\n\nAccenture Security is a leading provider of end-to-end cybersecurity services, including\nadvanced cyber defense, applied cybersecurity solutions and managed security operations.\nWe bring security innovation, coupled with global scale and a worldwide delivery capability\nthrough our network of Advanced Technology and Intelligent Operations centers.
