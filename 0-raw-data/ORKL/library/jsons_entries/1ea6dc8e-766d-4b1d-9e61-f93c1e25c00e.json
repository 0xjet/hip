The target this time are personnel belonging to defence organizations &\nother Government organizations in India.\n\nIn the recent wave of attacks, APT36 is using honey trapping technique to lure their targets.\nThe “honey trap” operations use fake profiles of attractive women to entice targets into\nopening their emails or chatting over messaging platforms, ultimately leading them into\ndownloading malware.\n\nSome of the attachment names that we found in the current themed attack:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen target opens such attachment, it drops MSIL based Crimson RAT which has been\nused by APT36 in many of their past attacks. This RAT is used for data-stealing activities and\nsending them to a CnC server.\n\n## Operation ‘Honey Trap’\n\nIndian Army has described ‘honey trap’ cases as a weapon of hybrid warfare being waged by\nthe enemy across the borders. The same theme is now being used by APT36 to lure its\ntargets.\n\nImage: News feeds showing the use of ‘honey trap’ cases\n\n\n-----\n\n## Campaign Overview\n\nThis campaign continues to use two separate infection chains. These two infection\ntechniques of APT36 have remained the same in the past couple of years.\n\nIn the first chain, a spear-phishing email has a macro loaded document as an attachment.\nThis document is responsible to execute a dropper module that starts the Crimson RAT tool\nto perform malicious activity.\n\nImage: Infection Chain –\n\nScenario 1\nIn the second chain, a spear-phishing email attachment directly contains a dropper module\nwithin a zip file. This dropper component opens a decoy document for the victim and runs\nCrimson RAT tool in the background to perform malicious activity.\n\nImage: Infection Chain – Scenario 2\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second infection chain is not so successful in organizations as their firewalls usually\nblock ‘EXE’ filetype within an email. This is the main reason, it is targeting personal accounts\nof individuals related to the Indian Defence sector.\n\n## Crimson RAT\n\nCrimson RAT remains a popular arsenal on APT36 group. We had published details of\nanother APT36 attack last month; working of the malware remains the same.\n\n[https://www.seqrite.com/resources/transparent-tribe-targetting-critical-indian-organizations](https://www.seqrite.com/resources/transparent-tribe-targetting-critical-indian-organizations)\n\nSummarized behaviour of this RAT\nProcess:\n\nList processes\nKill process\nExecute commands\nFile:\n\nDrives, files and directory traversal\nDelete files\nExecute files\nSearch for file extensions\nMetadata extraction\nCapture Screen:\n\nSingle and Continuous screenshots\nGet Thumbnails, Screen Size\nData Exfiltration:\n\nDownload from C2\nUpload to C2\n\nShown here are some functionality implementations in crimson RAT code:\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: Functionality to list all running process\n\nImage: Functionality to check and add startup entry in the registry\n\nImage: Functionality to search files of a given extension\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: Functionality to capture screenshot.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt is a well-established fact, that APT36 targets defence and other critical sector\norganizations. Usually, their targets are individuals and organizations which are of strategic\ninterest to India’s western neighbour. However, in this campaign, interestingly, some of the\ntargeted entities belong to organizations based in the eastern states in India! In last one year,\nthis is the second instance where we saw APT36 targeting organizations of interest to India’s\neastern neighbour\n\n**IOCs associated to the honeytrap campaign:**\n\n\n-----\n\n03E499D6E15817F5C7EF0F4F2FFD6D27\n0FD5FD92A6D8467A892C889B7DE49FC2\n\n11C594AF9B478A1EC688E874BCF61FE9\n\n2B22AC62E5843F22F4A51149ADE2D6D1\n\n3709CE3826A3AEBA20341ED2EF38259F\n\n3952EBEDF24716728B7355B8BE8E71B6\n\n467B10934E97D66E738E56501C22D1C4\n\n46B9FA19A52D0E83B63280547630BB33\n\n485F08EE7F741219BC1F2438319A33E4\n\n4B7D87FFA7D243A32D6D516583B04B8A\n\n4C0E752600746B6D67CF1D49C103D64A\n\n4DC350105A7879E14780B0A353816BC5\n\n5111974611588AFFE86C99EB9897FE02\n\n589729BC673FE05A2F3B4C85797E2CE6\n\n60BC356B4C88431353756B9496CF8F55\n\n6368B4E339D04B30DA20AF70C67EC743\n\n6801133F37481D8D865E984766E49D34\n\n6B2931A1E68E8C9B02B815DC8065B4F8\n\n6C11F92F6646E696724DE47D41ADC9F0\n\n6DAA8DB3ED3661F9BC708E9B3E5F5C3C\n\n8B22B21F258207F6B2C71483EAFF8CA6\n\n8D34A25D139F836FD36BBEB869A6BD3F\n\n**Subject matter experts:**\n\nPavankumar Chaudhari\n\nKalpesh Mantri\n\n\n92A16E790F69E68C393B3BEEA15E14AA\n94C00B72C37D5EB00E6B200AA71295C7\n\n9C9A6005C14D4EDFF392EE174E3A6964\n\nA15602E81A2E9860463F83ED66E7FFFD\n\nA22DBB859B380E375DF17D0751E407F5\n\nA7C8DD395CD707794A8BFFE9C06A6344\n\nA93F9E7325567A01357C565F2875C02F\n\nB6E5D3B7F74B99CB039B8226AAFE6E08\n\nC0C2BCA1B2668D10D0B26E0F6DB34A64\n\nC32E6BC20F46CF0EB6E3608F35651195\n\nC9895D76ACE01B7A1DB407B18059B785\n\nCBFAE579A25DF1E2FE0E02934EFD65DC\n\nD504CAB93AB055267BDD7693BFCFED5B\n\nD9CE6D2F89AFADD13D42CAC313C91582\n\nE670F157F988FA13317CD878DEB55697\n\nE89E1D0CDB0C0653744E5D12B6262F07\n\nE8AA25A0D8A95E43712765FEFAC3C068\n\nEA371D9282AB9C2A7274C5C8ACA9A64A\n\nF0C1AEA58025973D254FF9FD08599E65\n\nF70B3DA6C795B544FAC4F90AE4B45BA2\n\nFE74761CE3EEDB20FF50FEFE9C2D49EF\n\nFF2F32C78688AEC15C1283B1E625E72A\n\n\n-----\n\n### No Comments\n\nLeave a Reply.Your email address will not be published.\n\n\n-----",
