To meet both new and existing cybersecurity challenges, ICS-CERT redoubled\nefforts to provide its customers with comprehensive assessments of their ICS cybersecurity posture, arming them with both\nunderstanding of their cyber vulnerabilities and with the expert guidance they need to mitigate ICS cyber threats.\n\nThe third ICS-CERT Annual Assessment Report captures the Assessment team’s consolidated discoveries and activities\nthroughout the year. The report summarizes our key discoveries (including the most common vulnerabilities across our\ncustomer base), provides year-over-year vulnerability comparisons across critical infrastructure (CI) sectors, shows where\nwe focused our activity in FY2016, describes how customers can request an assessment, and provides our customers with\nrecommendations for enhancing their ICS cybersecurity posture.\n\nThe report also highlights some of the changes we are making to our assessment program to better serve our customers.\nFor example, in FY 2016 we launched Version 8.0 of our Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool (CSET), adding new functionality to\nthe tool. We began an extended hiring initiative to expand the number of assessment teams, enabling us to conduct more\nassessments for more customers each year. We also stood up the ICS Federal Critical Infrastructure Assessments (ICSFCIA)\nprogram, which focuses exclusively on providing assessments to Federal Government partners. The data and lessons we glean\nfrom this effort will, in turn, inform and support our continued focus on CI owned by the private sector and by state and\nlocal governments. Additionally, ICS-CERT is transitioning its assessment model from individual products to an integrated\nassessment process that includes all assessment offerings as well as more advanced analytics to provide improved actionable\nfeedback to asset owners.\n\nWe hope our partners find the information contained in this report useful. We continue to look for ways to improve service\nto our customers and we hope that the changes to our assessment program, along with the discoveries and continued\nfeedback that we provide our customers through our assessment team, will mitigate existing threats to control systems, help\nour customers stay ahead of the cyber-threat curve, and minimize the duration and severity of incidents if they do occur.\n\nThank you.\n\n###### John Felker Marty Edwards\nDirector of Operations, NCCIC\nDirector, ICS-CERT\n\n\n-----\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nFiscal Year 2016 marks the third publishing year for the ICS-CERT Annual Assessment Report.\n\nAs in previous years, the report provides our stakeholders with important information they can use to help secure\ntheir control systems and associated CI. This includes descriptions of the most common vulnerabilities found by our\nassessment teams in FY 2016 and the cybersecurity actions we recommend ICS owners and operators take to improve their\ncybersecurity posture.\n\nNow more than ever, vital operational processes depend on secure and reliable control systems. In addition to traditional\nindustrial processes, rapid increases in the connectivity of operational technology through the Internet of Things raise new\nchallenges for control systems security. ICS-CERT continues to work with its government and private sector partners to\nidentify, understand, and mitigate cyber threats to control systems and the CI they support.\n###### 1.1 Our Mission\n\n\nchallenges for control systems security. ICS-CERT continues to work with its government and private sector partners to\nidentify, understand, and mitigate cyber threats to control systems and the CI they support.\n###### 1.1 Our Mission\n\nICS-CERT’s mission is to reduce risk to the Nation’s critical infrastructure by strengthening the security and resilience of\ncontrol systems through public-private partnerships.\n\nWe pursue this mission through a comprehensive cybersecurity program that helps our government and private sector\npartners improve ICS security across the entire risk management spectrum. For example, our Assessment team offers\nCI partners a suite of products and services that include in-depth facilitated assessments — our Network Validation and\nVerification (NAVV) and Design Architecture Review (DAR) assessments — as well as our Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool\n(CSET), a downloadable software product that enables CI partners to conduct their own assessments against a range of\ncybersecurity standards. Section 4 provides more detailed descriptions of our assessment program as well as instructions for\nrequesting an assessment.\n\nIn addition to our cybersecurity assessment program, we offer our partners a wide variety of platforms through which to\nshare technical information about new and existing ICS threats and vulnerabilities within a global partnership network.\nWe also help our partners through technical malware and vulnerability analysis in our dedicated laboratory, provide\ncybersecurity training for all levels of knowledge and technical skill, and help our partners to respond to cybersecurity\nincidents focused on control systems.\n\nThrough ICS-CERT, our partners can also request services available through other NCCIC components. Examples of available\nservices include machine-to-machine threat information exchange through the NCCIC’s Automated Indicator Sharing\nprogram; enterprise network penetration testing, malware analysis, and incident response services; and cybersecurity\nexercises. ICS-CERT works closely with the NCCIC components that provide these services to ensure that our government\nand private sector partners can access the full range of NCCIC services and capabilities. Other NCCIC components include the\nUnited States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), National Coordinating Center for Communications (NCC),\nNational Cyber Exercise and Planning Program (NCEPP), and National Cybersecurity Assessment and Technical Services\n(NCATS) team.\n\n### ICS-CERT’s mission is to reduce risk to the Nation’s critical infrastructure by strengthening\n the security and resilience of control systems\n through public-private partnerships.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 2. FY 2016 Assessment Summary\n\nWe conducted 130 assessments in FY 2016, more than in any previous year. We also began a multi-year initiative to expand\nthe number of Assessment teams we can field and to provide dedicated teams to support our Federal Government and CI\ncustomers, respectively.

Weaknesses related to the principal of least functionality were the second most commonly discovered issues, as\nwas the case in FY 2015. Table 1 shows year-over-year comparisons of discovered weaknesses, in order of prevalence, from\nFY 2014-16. Of note, while least privilege and allocation of resources categories fell out of the top six weaknesses (they\nwere fourth and fifth in FY 2015), in FY 2016 they were ranked seventh and eighth, respectively. These changes may be\ndue to the year-over-year variances in the types of assets assessed rather than to shifts in the overarching ICS cybersecurity\nposture. Table 2 describes the potential consequences that may result from exploitation of these weaknesses.\n\n###### FY 2014-2016 TOP SIX WEAKNESS CATEGORIES IN ORDER OF PREVALENCE FY 2014 FY 2015 FY 2016\n1.

It also provides a complete list of all weakness categories.\n\nThe recommendations provided in this section are consistent with best security practices for protecting control systems from\nthreats of unauthorized use. In addition, to support overarching ICS security, ICS-CERT maintains a portfolio of guidance\n[and best practices documents on its website (https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/). These include, for example, ICS-CERT’s Improving](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)\n_[Industrial Control System Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies and](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)_ _[Seven Steps to Effectively Defend Industrial Control Systems reports.](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Seven%20Steps%20to%20Effectively%20Defend%20Industrial%20Control%20Systems_S508C.pdf)_\nICS-CERT encourages its partners to review these and other ICS-CERT information products.

Inadequate access security controls for virtual machines (VMs).**\n\nInadequate user access security controls to the hypervisor (VM monitor) host management interface may provide a single\npoint of failure and entry that adversaries could use to gain access to every guest VM on the host computer, allowing\npotential unauthorized access to any part of the ICS.\n\n**B. Insecure implementation of remote access.**\n\nWhether access is from the corporate network to the ICS or from the Internet to the ICS, this access may present a serious\nrisk to the system. Attackers can gain access to user accounts at the users’ home or corporate office and obtain the user\ncredentials and connection to access critical ICS assets or allow an infected computer an access channel into the networks via\na virtual private network (VPN) connection.\n\n**C. Improper use of Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN).**\n\nWhile VLANs can logically segment networks, if users do not follow best practices of the hardware vendors, unauthorized\nusers can traverse to other VLAN segments. Default and native VLANs that remain unchanged on trunk ports provide an\navenue to traverse from one VLAN to another.\n\n**D. Weak Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) security policies for ICS.**\n\nMobile and other devices are not typically managed by the organization and security policies implemented by the\norganization are often not implemented on the portable devices. Use of BYOD devices to access personal email, web pages,\nand social media applications, are inherently high risk to ICS.\n\n**E. Insufficient hardening of cloud services security and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for critical ICS functions.**\n\nOrganizations must ensure that the parts of any ICS architecture hosted externally maintain security levels consistent with\nthe criticality of the ICS functions. Organizations should also ensure that SLAs are sufficient to maintain ICS operational\nfunctions associated with recovery, event/incident management, failover, forensic support, monitoring, and other operational\nfunctions that may require support by the cloud-hosting service provider.\n\n**F. Inadequate adoption of ICS Network Monitoring as a core Defense-in-Depth (DiD) strategy.**\n\nNetwork monitoring is an essential security measure for any critical system as an important part of the attacker life cycle\nis to establish a command and control presence in the system. An attacker will leverage this to receive system discovery\ninformation and determine how to best implement a customized attack toolkit to exploit system vulnerability and achieve\nattack goals. Most CI organizations have some level of monitoring at the corporate level, rarely within ICS networks.\n\nFigure 4, on the following page, illustrates these potential network attack scenarios.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Potential Network Attack Scenarios\n\n\n-----\n\n###### pi\n\nWhile ICS-CERT assessments identified weaknesses across all control families, six categories represented roughly 36\npercent of the total vulnerabilities discovered across assessed CI sectors. The top six categories were Boundary Protection;\nLeast Functionality; Identification and Authentication; Physical Access Control; Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting; and\nAuthenticator Management. ICS-CERT’s assessment methodology categorizes weaknesses based on the National Institute\nof Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Special Publication 800-53, “Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information\nSystems and Organizations,” control family sub-categories (See Appendix A for Control Family descriptions). This section\nsummarizes the six most common vulnerabilities by Security Control Family, subcategory, prevalence, potential risk, and\nrecommended mitigations.\n\n|1. System and Communications Protection: Boundary Protection (SC-7) 94 DISCOVERIES|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Description|Why is Boundary Protection Important?|Recommended Mitigation|\n|• Controls associated with the monitoring and control of communications at the ICS external electronic boundaries and key internal boundaries, the implementation of subnetworks to separate critical systems, and the implementation of managed protective interfaces for external connectivity to critical systems.|• Inadequate boundary protections for the ICS network make it more difficult to detect unauthorized activity. Weak boundary protection provides various vectors for unauthorized interfacing with devices and systems that directly support the control process. • The scope of threats and general risk to control systems operations increases significantly without logical separation of the ICS network from enterprise networks (or from untrusted systems such as the Internet).|• Separate the enterprise network from the ICS network and establish a demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two systems for ICS perimeter protection. Refer to NIST 800-SP 82, Chapter 5, for information on designing perimeter protections for ICS. • The DMZ should house a dedicated “jump” server that permits systems on the enterprise network (or those accessing via a remote method such as VPN) to access data elements derived from the ICS network. • Harden the jump server, running only essential services.

If a password is compromised, the system assumes the user is an authorized party. • Passwords can be easily compromised using techniques such as brute force (password guessing) or pass the hash techniques. • If encryption is not enabled on authentication—meaning password data are transferred as clear text—attackers can simply listen to the traffic and pull the user name and passwords off the wire while in transit. Once compromised, persistent access is granted for the lifetime of the user accounts and passwords (that is, account passwords that never expire or inactive/ legacy accounts not disabled when not in use).|• Establish and enforce a password policy. Protect those passwords via encryption. This policy should require the use of strong passwords and the periodic change of those passwords. • Implement additional requirements for remote connections to verify the authenticity of parties requesting access remotely. Multi-factor authentication is typically seen as two or more of the following: something known (password), something possessed (RSA token or PKI certificate), and something a user is (that is, biometrics, such as a voice print).|\n\n\n-----\n\nIn FY 2016, ICS-CERT identified 700 weaknesses through its 98 DAR and NAVV assessments.

ICS-CERT s Assessment Program\n\nICS-CERT launched the Assessment Program in 2009 with the goal of helping CI owners and operators understand and\nimprove their control systems security posture. Initially focused on facilitated assessments using CSET — which provides\na good initial security overview — in 2012, the assessment program expanded its offerings to include detailed, in-depth\ntechnical assessments through DAR and NAVV assessments.\n###### 4.1 Support Structure for Government and Private Sector Customers\n\n\n###### 4.1 Support Structure for Government and Private Sector Customers\n\nIn FY 2016, ICS-CERT established a dedicated federal facilities assessment team and a dedicated private sector assessment\nteam. These teams provide support to their respective customers under an integrated management and data sharing structure\nthat ensures anonymized and protected information gleaned from both federal and private sector assessments support\nanalytical efforts to improve overarching control systems security.\n\n###### 4.1.1 ICS-CERT Private Sector Assessment Team\nA core part of ICS-CERT’s mission to reduce risk to the Nation’s CI is to provide onsite cybersecurity assessments to CI asset\nowners and operators to strengthen their ICS cybersecurity posture. ICS-CERT bases assessments on standards, guidelines,\nand best practices, and are provided to CI asset owners and operators at no cost using our congressional funding. Our\nassessment methodologies provide a structured framework that asset owners and operators can use to assess, re-assess,\nprotect, detect, and continually validate the cybersecurity of their ICS networks. The information gained from assessments\nalso provides stakeholders with the understanding and context necessary to build effective defense-in-depth processes for\nenhancing their cybersecurity posture.\n\nICS-CERT’s Private Sector Assessment team works with CI asset owners to determine which set of assessment services best fits\nthe needs of that particular organization. The services provided may include a combination of a facilitated CSET, DAR, and/or\nNAVV assessments, depending on the current state and goals of the organization. Information shared with ICS-CERT can be\nprotected under the auspices of the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program.\n\n###### 4.1.2 Industrial Control Systems Federal Critical Infrastructure Assessment Team (ICSFCIA)\nIn FY 2016, ICS-CERT established the ICSFCIA to provide dedicated assessment support for federal partners. The ICSFCIA\noffers federal organizations a comprehensive suite of assessment services, including a research-based “state of security”\nevaluation that explores potentially risky open source information about a facility or system, a Maturity Level Evaluation\n(MLE) using CSET, identification of indicators of compromise, DAR and NAVV assessments, log analysis, and Operational\nSustainability. Upon completion of all assessments, ICSFCIA will compile an in-depth report for the federal facility owner,\nwhich includes a prioritized analysis of key discoveries and practical mitigations for enhancing the cybersecurity posture of\nthe organization.\n\nThrough this program, ICS-CERT also works closely with the NCCIC’s NCATS team. NCATS conducts cybersecurity\nassessments on enterprise networks, with a focus on the Federal Government’s most critical assets. ICS-CERT works with\nNCATS to provide ICS-specific assessments and technical expertise to improve ICS security for these assets.\n###### 4.2 Assessment Elements\n\nIn order to categorize assessment discoveries, ICS-CERT bases assessment and analysis of security vulnerabilities on NIST\nSpecial Publication 800-53. NIST 800-53 control family mappings provide a consistent and repeatable methodology for\ncollecting and correlating data to analyze and trend key discoveries at a holistic level.\n\nNIST Special Publication 800-82, “Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security,” implements an ICS overlay to NIST\n800-53, tailoring security guidance to the unique ICS operational and system characteristics. While NIST Special Publication\n800-82 applies generally to all CI control systems, ICS CERT works with sector stakeholders to provide additional tailoring to\nunique aspects of individual customers, as necessary. Appendix A shows the top-level NIST 800-53 Security Control Families.\n\n\n-----\n\nservices include\n\n - Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool (CSET)\n\n - Design Architecture Review (DAR)\n\n - Network Validation and Verification (NAVV)\n\nICS-CERT’s cybersecurity assessment services include evaluation of ICS design architecture, verification and validation\nof network traffic, and systems log review and analysis. An evaluation of the design architecture includes a high level\npreliminary evaluation of the site security posture, leveraging CSET, followed by an in-depth review and evaluation of the ICS\nnetwork design, configuration, and inter-connectivity to internal and external systems. This system analysis provides ICS asset\nowners with a comprehensive cybersecurity evaluation focusing on defensive strategies associated with their specific control\nsystems network.\n\nNetwork data traffic analysis provides asset owners with information to identify anomalous and potentially suspicious\ncommunications sourced from, or destined for, control systems assets. This service offering provides a sophisticated analysis\nof the asset owner’s network traffic, which asset owners collect, from within their control system network environment.\nICS-CERT subject matter experts (SME) analyze the captured network traffic using a combination of open source and\ncommercially available tools to develop a detailed representation of the communications, flows, and relationships between\ndevices.\n\n###### 4.2.1 Cyber Security Evaluation Tool\nDHS developed CSET to enable CI owners and operators to conduct a basic evaluation of their ICS cybersecurity posture\nbased on standards and practices best suited to their sector.\n\nCI customers can use CSET to support both self-assessments as well as ICS-CERT facilitated assessments, undertaken in\nconjunction with DAR and NAVV assessments. CSET is available as a no-cost download. CSET maps user input to questions\nassociated with selected cybersecurity standards and best practices. To maximize the effectiveness of the CSET evaluation\nprocess, the asset owner should include SMEs from various disciplines to conduct the guided discovery-oriented evaluation\nof the entity’s underlying control processes, procedures, policies, methodologies, and protective and detective security\ncontrols. In FY 2016, ICS-CERT released CSET Version 8.0, which added a number of new features to the tool, including\na simplified user interface, five new standards, specialized question sets, and new component additions to the network\ndiagram function.\n\n###### 4.2.2 Design Architecture Review\nA DAR is an assessment process facilitated by ICS-CERT assessment personnel. ICS-CERT works with system owners and\noperators to perform a thorough manual assessment and analysis of the operational process. ICS-CERT focuses on assessing\nthe security of the underlying control system architecture, the integration of Information Technology (IT) and Operational\nTechnology (OT), vendor support, network monitoring, cybersecurity controls, and a review of internal and external\nconnections used within the control systems environment. The process focuses heavily on ICS Network Architecture, Asset\nInventory, and Protective and Detective Security controls.\n\nThis review provides asset owners with a thorough evaluation of system interdependencies, vulnerabilities, and mitigation\noptions. ICS-CERT examines information related to key ICS external connections and includes an in-depth review of control\nsystems design documents, drawings, and architectures. ICS-CERT provides a detailed final report to the user that captures\nthe key discoveries identified by the team and provides potential impact and recommended mitigations for each.\n\n###### 4.2.3 Network Architecture Validation and Verification\nThe NAVV assessment process entails the analysis of (passively captured) traffic within the ICS network. Using a combination\nof open-source and commercially available tools, ICS-CERT visualizes and performs analysis on the network traffic and\ndevice-to- device communications occurring within various ICS network segments to identify potentially unauthorized or\nsuspect communications. Threat data analysis of the traffic evaluates indicators of known unauthorized attacks in the user’s\nnetwork.\n\n\n-----\n\n - Verify the accuracy of ICS network diagrams;\n\n - Identify rogue or misconfigured devices or malicious data communications;\n\n - Analyze data flows to ensure boundary protection devices work as designed;\n\n - Identify opportunities or areas to improve zoning and perimeter protections;\n\n - Baseline the ICS network (including a protocol hierarchy and organization of network traffic); and\n\n - Gain practical knowledge of how to passively monitor and verify the communications occurring within their ICS\n\nnetworks.\n\nThe process provides organizations with a comprehensive view of network communication occurring within the ICS\nnetwork infrastructure, in addition to those communications sourced from or destined to ICS network segments. ICS-CERT\ntypically provides this review as a part of the overall assessment service, however they also offer it independently.\n###### 4.3 The Assessment Process: What to Expect\n\nICS-CERT schedules and conducts assessments based on available resources. The integrated assessment process typically\ncontains several phases. A baseline evaluation begins the assessment using CSET, followed by DAR and NAVV assessments.\nWhile assessments could be performed at any of the levels individually (CSET, DAR, or NAVV), the process is most effective\nwhen all three elements are performed together. Figure 5 describes ICS-CERT’s assessment process.\n\nFigure 5: ICS-CERT’s Assessment Process\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ICS-CERT assessment team makes every effort to accommodate the needs and special circumstances of the organizations\nwith which it is working. Before scheduling an assessment, ICS-CERT must receive all pre-engagement paperwork.\nOrganizations should complete general pre-assessment documentation (that is, Request for Technical Assistance, Logistics\nForm Request, and PCII Express Statement) and, following approval of those, network diagrams, network header data, and\ninventory lists to review and discuss prior to scheduling the assessment.\n\nTypical assessments take three to four days to complete, depending on the number and size of the systems assessed.\nOrganizations should invite any personnel who are familiar with or influence their site’s security policies, control system\narchitecture, topologies, and protocols to attend the assessment. These include control systems operators/engineers,\ninformation technology personnel, policy and management personnel, and SMEs. ICS-CERT’s assessment team does not\nconnect to customers’ networks. The team will work from the information provided prior to the assessment, which it will\nevaluate prior to visiting with the facility.\n\nUpon completion of the assessment process, ICS-CERT compiles an in-depth report for the asset owner, including a\nprioritized analysis of key discoveries and practical mitigations for enhancing the organization’s cybersecurity posture.\nICS-CERT also captures post-assessment feedback through a questionnaire and follow-up discussion 180 days after the\nassessment. The feedback helps ICS-CERT improve its assessment offerings, gather information about the value of ICS-CERT’s\nrecommendations, and understand the degree to which the asset owner’s cybersecurity posture improved after the\nassessment.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 5. A Look Ahead to FY 2017\n\nIn FY 2017, ICS-CERT is launching a number of important initiatives to improve its assessment products, services, and\ncapabilities.\n\nOur Private Sector Assessment team is transitioning the services it provides to CI customers from discrete CSET, DAR, and\nNAVV assessments to an integrated process that includes all assessment offerings along with advanced analytics that provide\nactionable feedback to asset owners. This integrated process will include a baseline assessment performed using CSET,\nfollowed by a deep-dive design architecture review of the ICS, communications, and networking architecture, and analysis of\nthe network data communications. In FY 2017, the ICS-CERT Assessment Program will also add log analysis to its assessment\nservices. Log analysis can rapidly identify issues such as misconfigured equipment and communications links and, more\nimportantly, system intrusions. Asset owners submit useful system or event logs, which provide a sampling of the central\ncontrol system elements, such as an ICS server, a Historian/Database collector, or a remotely connected human-machine\ninterface (HMI) system.\n\n\nactionable feedback to asset owners. This integrated process will include a baseline assessment performed using CSET,\nfollowed by a deep-dive design architecture review of the ICS, communications, and networking architecture, and analysis of\nthe network data communications. In FY 2017, the ICS-CERT Assessment Program will also add log analysis to its assessment\nservices.

Asset owners submit useful system or event logs, which provide a sampling of the central\ncontrol system elements, such as an ICS server, a Historian/Database collector, or a remotely connected human-machine\ninterface (HMI) system.\n\nSuccessfully piloted in FY 2016, this integrated assessment process found abnormal network traffic, which indicated a\npotential system breach during several onsite assessments. On such occasions, the ICS-CERT assessment team coordinated\nwith the asset owner and contacted the NCCIC’s incident response team to provide additional assistance through the\nmitigation process.\n\nICS-CERT will also expand the scope and number of assessment services it provides federal facility partners through its\nnewly established ICSFCIA program. ICSFCIA focuses on identifying the health of the control systems within the Federal\nGovernment against advance persistent threats. These assessments provide federal partners with in-depth security evaluations,\ninformation on attack paths, indicators of compromise, and mitigation techniques to secure ICS environments. ICS-CERT is\nalso adding an operational sustainability capability to help review and maintain prepared, resilient, and secure federal ICS.\n\nThrough the ICSFCIA program, ICS-CERT will also be a primary contributor to a comprehensive and coordinated interagency\neffort to secure building and access control systems for more than 9,000 facilities in the federal portfolio. In close\npartnership with the General Services Administration, Federal Protective Service, and the Interagency Security Committee,\nICS-CERT is providing assessment services for the highest-risk federal facilities, technical expertise, and training resources to\nsupport this important interagency effort. ICS-CERT will also support and participate in developing the standards utilized by\nfederal facilities for assessing cyber risk to control systems (for example, Interagency Security Committee standards).\n\n\n-----\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\nICS-CERT looks forward to continuing to support its private sector and government partners in securing their control\nsystems. Leveraging the insights gained through our assessment data and customer feedback in FY 2016, we will build\nupon and enhance the capabilities and technical expertise we added to our assessment program for FY 2017. This includes\nongoing maturation of the ICSFCIA program for our federal partners, continued evolution of our private sector assessments\nfrom individual offerings into a more comprehensive assessment process that includes log analysis, and building additional\nfeatures into CSET to best meet our customers’ needs. We will also continue to coordinate closely with other federal agencies,\nproviding their constituents with access to ICS-CERT assessment and other cybersecurity offerings. ICS-CERT thanks its\npartners for the opportunity to support them and for their continued commitment to control systems security.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Appendix A.
