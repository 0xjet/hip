It appears to be run by a Russian-speaking group of hackers.\n\nThe forum provides members with tools to patch RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) servers to support\nmultiple user logins, as well as other hacking tools, such as proxy installers and sysinfo collectors. The\nmain goal of the xDedic forum is to facilitate the buying and selling of credentials for hacked servers\nwhich are available through RDP.\n\nFrom governmental networks to corporations, it is possible to find almost anything on xDedic for as little\nas 6 USD per server. This one-time cost provides a malicious \"customer\" with access to all the data on\nthe server and endless other possibilities, such as using the access to launch further attacks.\n\nTo investigate xDedic, Kaspersky Lab teamed up with a European ISP. This research allowed us to collect\ndata about the victims and the way the marketplace operates.\n\nThis report in a nutshell:\n\n Description of the xDedic marketplace and its offering.\n Statistics about servers for sale and their profile.\n How the attackers get access to the servers.\n What tools and Trojans they install in the hacked servers.\n High profile victims with hacked servers on the market.\n Attribution of the administrators of the forum.\n\n[For more information contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Marketplace\n\nThe marketplace is located at the domain xdedic[.]biz and anyone can register to use it. New members\nneed to use their account within 72 hours of registration, otherwise the account is automatically\nremoved unless they pay a fee of 10 USD.\n\n_Figure 1. xDedic main login_\n\nDuring registration, the user is asked to provide either an e-mail address or a Jabber account. In the case\nof Jabber-account based registration, a confirmation code is sent in order to validate the account.\n\nWe strongly advice not to register to the xDedic marketplace, as any activity in the marketplace might\nbe in dangerous or even illegal.\n\nAccording to an analysis of the information available in the marketplace, the service was started some\ntime in 2014 and gained major popularity in the middle of 2015 when over 3,000 servers were added to\nthe marketplace. Since then many new offerings have been posted and re-posted on the forum.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Marketplace activity in number of new server offerings_\n\nOnce logged into the forum, the user can access a Dashboard with general news as well as a page with a\nlist of servers available for purchase.\n\n_Figure 3. Servers purchase form_\n\nFor each server, detailed information such as price, location, speed, anti-virus installed, etc. is provided.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Additional server details_\n\nThe owners of xdedic[.]biz claim not to be related to the sellers of hacked server access, but only to\nprovide a secure trading platform for others. It is possible to see the seller´s nickname in the list of\navailable servers (see Figure 2).\n\nAs of May 2016, access to 70,624 dedicated servers worldwide was offered for sale.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Number of servers available_\n\n## Detailed statistics of available servers\n\nIn March 2016, the sales inventory included access to 51,752 **servers from 183** **countries, located in**\n**11,050 different subnets. There were 425 unique sellers on the marketplace.**\n\nIn May 2016, we counted 70,624 servers from 416 unique sellers in 173 affected countries. This shows\nthat the database of users and servers is carefully maintained.\n\nFigure 6. Top 10 sellers - May 2016\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7.

That´s why the marketplace tags\nthe RDP servers that have been proven, through specific testing, not to have been blacklisted by certain\nonline resources. The owners of xDedic owners have developed a tool that can automatically collect\ninformation about the system, including websites that are available from it, any software installed and\nso on.\n\n_Figure 8.

In the case of some proxifiers or mass-email sending\nsoftware, these pre-installed features can be leveraged by the criminals to send out spam or use proxy\nsoftware without arousing suspicion.\n\nThere is a strong interest in accounting, tax reporting and point-of -sale (PoS) software which apparently\nopens up many opportunities for fraudsters.\n\n\n-----\n\nSpam and Attacking Tools Gambling and Financial Software POS Software\n\n\nAdvanced Mass Sender\nBitvise Tunnelier\nDU Brute\nLexisNexis Spam Soft\nLexisNexis Proxifier\nProxifier\nSpam Soft\n\n\nFull Tilt Poker\niPoker Network\nUltraTax 2010 (2011,..,2015)\nAbacus Tax Software\nCCH tax14 (tax15)\nCCH Small Firm Services\nChoicePoint\nProSeries TAX (2014,2015)\nProSystem fx Tax\nTAX Software\n2015 Tax Praparation\nTax Management Inc.\nLacerte Tax\n\n\nPosWindows\nBrasilPOS\nPOS AccuPOS\nPOS Active-Charge\nPOS Amigo\nPOS Catapult\nPOS Firefly\nPOS ePOS\nPOS EasiPos\nPOS Revel\nPOS Software (Generic)\nPOS Toast\nPOS QBPOS\nPosTerminal\nPOS kiosk.exe\nPOS roi.exe\nPOS PTService.exe\nPOS pxpp.exe\nPOS w3wp.exe\nPOS DpsEftX.ocx\nPOS AxUpdatePortal.exe\nPOS callerIdserver.exe\nPOS PURCHASE.exe\nPOS XPS.exe\nPOS XChgrSrv.exe\n\n\nWe counted 453 servers from 67 countries with PoS software installed:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Servers for sale with Point-of-Sale software - May 2016_\n\n## The xDedic validator tool \n\nThere is a separate portal for the so-called “partners” of the xDedic forum. These are essentially the\nsellers who are offering the hacked servers on the market. The partners’ portal is password-protected\nand can be found at “partner.xdedic[.]biz”:\n\n_Figure 10. xDedic partners portal_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe partner’s portal has a different set of tools available for download. From these, the most interesting\nis “SysScan”. “SysScan” is a validator tool used by xDedic partners to profile servers which are to be\nmade available for sale on the main forum.\n\nWe were able to find several versions of “SysScan”, listed below by their MD5s:\n\n `fac495be1c71012682ebb27092060b43`\n `e8cc69231e209db7968397e8a244d104`\n `a53847a51561a7e76fd034043b9aa36d`\n `e8691fa5872c528cd8e72b82e7880e98`\n `F661b50d45400e7052a2427919e2f777`\n\nThe “SysScan” tool connects to a C&C server in order to report information about the system once it is\nexecuted. The information reported includes:\n\n Server_ID, Username\n Windows version\n System Language\n if system is 64 bits or not\n size of installed memory\n CPU type\n if ports 25 and 80 are open\n if the system is virtual or physical\n what type of VM software is used\n Antivirus software, if any\n\nThen it checks the server´s upload and download speeds using a set of speed-check scripts.\nFinally, it checks what kind of software is installed in the system (see the list of available software\nabove).\n\n_Figure 11. Example of software information gathered_\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter gathering all this information, the SysScan tool encrypts it with AES using a hardcoded derived\npassword (- k8iJGx3oGo) and posts the data to the C&C in the /manual_result path.\n\nThis tool also checks if the RDP service is available and patches it if needed. It also adds the following\nmodifications to the Windows registry:\n```\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\\WinStations\\RDP-Tcp\" /v\nUserAuthentication /t REG_DWORD /d\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\TerminalServer\\WinStations\\RDPTcp\" /v UserAuhentication /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f& reg delete \nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\" /v\nlegalnoticecaption /f& reg delete\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\" /v\nlegalnoticetext /f\n\n```\nThe following is a list of all the known C&Cs that Syscan uses to send its results:\n\n http://37.49.224[.]144:8189/manual_result\n http://37.49.224[.]144/ptest.php\n http://37.49.224[.]144/sp.php\n http://37.49.224[.]144/test_servers.xml\n http://37.49.224[.]144/gfileset.php\n hxxp://5.56.133[.]145\n http://191.101.31[.]126/ptest.php\n http://191.101.31[.]126/sp.php\n http://191.101.31[.]126/test_servers.xml\n http://191.101.31[.]126/gfileset.php\n http://191.101.31[.]126:8189/manual_result\n\nInterestingly, the C&C server at 191.101.31[.]126 has a very specific banner on port 8189:\n\n_Figure 12. xDedic C&C banner_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Hacking the servers\n\nWhen we started our investigation, the assumption was that xDedic partners use brute-forcing attacks\nin order to get access to the servers they control. On a machine where the xDedic validator tool\n(sysscan.exe) was detected, we also found tools that specialized in performing brute-force attacks\nagainst RDP servers, such as DUBrute and XPC (detected as Hacktool.Win32.Bruteforce). Later, we were\nable to confirm this hypothesis with one of the victims.\n\n## The SCCLIENT Trojan\n\nThanks to a partner in our investigation, we were able to analyse a server that had been hacked and put\nup for sale on the xDedic market. This section provides some information about the very interesting\nmalware found on it.\n\nOnce the server was compromised by the attackers through RDP password brute-forcing, they installed\na custom piece of malware in the path “/Windows/System32/scclient.exe” and registered it as a service\nthat would start automatically upon system boot. Interestingly, the attackers also installed bitcoinmining software, to use the idle time while they waited for a buyer for the server.\n\nThis SCClient Trojan connects to one of eight C&C servers:\n\n  - q968787.ignorelist[.]com:32973\n\n  - q968787.mooo[.]com:32973\n\n  - q968787.homenet[.]org:32973\n\n  - q968787.strangled[.]net:32973 - SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab\n\n  - q96b7b7.ignorelist[.]com:32973  - SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab\n\n  - q96b7b7.mooo[.]com:32973  - SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab\n\n  - q96b7b7.homenet[.]org:32973 - SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab\n\n  - q96b7b7.strangled[.]net:32973 - SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab\n\nWe were able to sinkhole five of them, which allowed us to collect information about other hacked\nservers running the same malware. During the first 12 hours, we received connections from over 3600\nunique IPs.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13. Victim servers hitting our sinkhole during the first 12 hours_\n\nWe were able to identify some high profile victims such as Governmental entities and universities.\nDuring the investigation, we worked with several partners which allowed us to notify some of the\nvictims about the infections in their networks.\n\n## xDedic Socks System tool\n\nIn one of the topics opened by the xDedic team in the forum vor[.]ac, another piece of software was\nintroduced. They call it the xDedic Socks System:\n\n_Figure 14. xDedic Socks System tool_\n\nThis is actually a wrapper for a popular proxy tool known as “3proxy tiny proxy”. The xDedic Socks\nSystem can install the 3proxy tool in the system with the click of a button.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe tool basically opens the chosen ports (by default 8975 for SOCKS and 8795 for HTTPS) on the\ninfected server, turning it into a SOCKS or HTTPS proxy, with or without password-protection.\n\nThe tool could be run as a service. In order to do that, it simply drops an instance of 3proxy as\n\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\pxsrvc\\pxsrvc.exe and runs it with “shell execute” as a process or service, with\nportnames set by the user via GUI.\n\n## xDedic RDP Client\n\nThe xDedic team also developed their own RDP Client for Windows:\n\n_Figure 15. xDedic RDP client_\n\nAccording to them:\n_“xDedic RDP Client is primarily designed to make life easier for our customers. Copying ip, login,_\n_password into a rdp conection window takes long time. Now just go to your purchase history, and click_\n_\"Copy\" on the contrary the server to which you want to log in. Then switch to program, press the button_\n_\"Paste\", information about RDP will be inserted into the fields, then simply press a Connect button.”_\n\n\n-----\n\n## xDedic tools: KSN statistics \n\nWe were able to get statistical information about the geographical distribution of all the xDedic tools\ndescribed above from Kaspersky Security Network.\n\nThe first chart provides the geographical distribution based on all detections:\n\n_Figure 16. xDedic detections, geographical distribution_\n\nThe second chart provides geographical detection for servers:\n\n_Figure 17. xDedic server detections, geographical distribution_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe final chart provides geographical detection based on desktop detections:\n\n_Figure 18. xDedic desktop detections, geographical distribution_\n\nAs can be seen above, there are more detections on desktop users than on servers, as antivirus is much\nmore popular on desktops.\n\nDetections of xDedic tools on servers prevail in three regions: Europe, US and Middle East. In total we\nfound these tools on servers from more than 50 different countries.\n\nDesktop detection statistics are very interesting in two countries: Russia and Ukraine. This supports the\ntheory that this service was initially founded by Russian-speaking people.\n\nKaspersky Labs products detect this set of tools as Hacktool.Win32.Rpdpatch.gen\n\n## Attribution\n\nThe Whois for the xdedic[.]biz (xдедик) domain is registered to:\n```\nRegistrant Name:  Mikhail Mikhail\nRegistrant Organization: Mikhail\nRegistrant Address1:  str.Molova 21\nRegistrant City:  Moscow\nRegistrant State/Province: Moscow\nRegistrant Postal Code:  193350\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nRegistrant Country:  Russian Federation\nRegistrant Country Code: RU\nTelephone:   78122842923\nFax:   78122842923\nCreated:  09/11/2014\nExpired:  09/10/2016\nEmail:  support@e-investhost.com\n\n```\nand currently resolves to:\n\n 104.28.18.107 (CloudFlare)\n 104.28.19.107 (CloudFlare)\n\nLast year the forum was hosted on a different IP which was found via Passive DNS. The following IPs\nappear to point to the forum backends behind CloudFlare:\n\n  - 144.76.82.238 (Apache web server, shared hosting, old), Hetzner AG, Germany\n\n  - 136.243.130.185 (nginx), Hetzner AG, Germany.\n\n     - Content from latest xdedic[.]biz confirmed from the server certificate.\n\n```\nServer certificate:\nsubject: C=AU; ST=Some-State; O=Internet Widgits Pty Ltd; CN=xdedic.biz;\nemailAddress=qwe@xdedic.biz <mailto:emailAddress=qwe@xdedic.biz>\nstart date: 2015-12-08 14:26:01 GMT\nexpire date: 2016-12-07 14:26:01 GMT\nissuer: C=AU; ST=Some-State; O=Internet Widgits Pty Ltd; CN=xdedic.biz;\nemailAddress=qwe@xdedic.biz <mailto:emailAddress=qwe@xdedic.biz>\nSSL certificate verify result: self signed certificate (18), continuing anyway.\n\n```\n\nThe service also provides a Jabber server for support, running on xdedic[.]tk (87.236.215[.]18).\nThis server (87.236.215[.]18) is known for spreading malware in the past.\n\nThe previous email at e-investhost[.]com was also used to register other domains, such as\nXdedic[.]biz, viagra-purchase[.]org, wertor[.]info, omerta[.]cc, pharmaplus[.]biz, qualitypillsnorx[.]com.\nThe person behind them uses different Russian addresses and telephone numbers.\n\n\n-----\n\nWertor[.]info (scam website) and viagra-purchase[.]org domain information provide a different name:\nAlex Pilsner.\n\nPivoting on this new name, we find a new interesting domain:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 19.

Protect_\n_your site, coordinate already under DDOS attack! We register Abuse-resistant domains (blocking_\n_probability is minimal)”._\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion \n\nThe existence of shady forums dedicated to cybercrime is old news. However, it is interesting to see how\nthe main focus of cybercriminals has changed over the last few years, the high degree of specialization\nachieved by the administrators of the forums and what the relevance of such services might be in the\nera of APTs.\n\nWe will start with the last point. The vast amount of servers for sale on the xDedic marketplace offers a\nvery likely alternative for APT actors with low resources, willing to fly under the radar or having\ndifficulties in getting a foothold in any of its victims. 8 USD is a very cheap price to pay for full access to\npotential high profile targets. Usually overlooked, servers that have been hacked using brute-force\nmethods might present an opportunity for APT actors that doesn’t arouse suspicion.\n\nOther than the implications for APTs, the marketplace´s statistics show a consistent number of servers\navailable for sale in very different locations. The tagging system makes it easy for opportunistic attackers\nto find new targets according to their needs, and the bitcoin mining might be a nice side-line for the\ncriminals.\n\nAll in all, not only can this successful model be easily replicated, but we expect to see even more\nspecialized marketplaces appear where APT-as-a-service becomes a reality.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix I – Indicators of Compromise\n\n### Hashes\n```\nSysScan\nfac495be1c71012682ebb27092060b43 \ne8cc69231e209db7968397e8a244d104 \na53847a51561a7e76fd034043b9aa36d \ne8691fa5872c528cd8e72b82e7880e98 \nF661b50d45400e7052a2427919e2f777 \n Registry entries\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\\WinStations\\RDP-Tcp\" /v\nUserAuthentication /t REG_DWORD /d\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\TerminalServer\\WinStations\\RDPTcp\" /v UserAuhentication /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f& reg delete \nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\" /v\nlegalnoticecaption /f& reg delete\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\" /v\nlegalnoticetext /f\n C&Cs\nhttp://37.49.224[.]144:8189/manual_result\nhttp://37.49.224[.]144/ptest.php\nhttp://37.49.224[.]144/sp.php\nhttp://37.49.224[.]144/test_servers.xml\nhttp://37.49.224[.]144/gfileset.php\nhxxp://5.56.133[.]145\nhttp://191.101.31[.]126/ptest.php\nhttp://191.101.31[.]126/sp.php\nhttp://191.101.31[.]126/test_servers.xml\nhttp://191.101.31[.]126/gfileset.php\nhttp://191.101.31[.]126:8189/manual_result\nq968787.ignorelist[.]com:32973\nq968787.mooo[.]com:32973\nq968787.homenet[.]org:32973\nq968787.strangled[.]net:32973  - SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab\nq96b7b7.ignorelist[.]com:32973 - SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab\nq96b7b7.mooo[.]com:32973  - SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab\nq96b7b7.homenet[.]org:32973  - SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab\nq96b7b7.strangled[.]net:32973  - SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n## SCCLIENT installation file path\n```\n%SystemRoot%\\System32\\scclient.exe\n\n### Yara rules\nrule xDedic_SysScan_unpacked {   \nmeta:\n    author = \" Kaspersky Lab\"\n    maltype = \"crimeware\"\n    type =\"crimeware\"\n    filetype = \"Win32 EXE\"\n    date = \"2016-03-14\"\n    version = \"1.0\"\n    hash = \"fac495be1c71012682ebb27092060b43\"\n    hash = \"e8cc69231e209db7968397e8a244d104\"\n    hash = \"a53847a51561a7e76fd034043b9aa36d\"\n    hash = \"e8691fa5872c528cd8e72b82e7880e98\"\n    hash = \"F661b50d45400e7052a2427919e2f777\"\nstrings:\n    $a1=\"/c ping -n 2 127.0.0.1 & del \\\"SysScan.exe\\\"\" ascii wide\n    $a2=\"SysScan DEBUG Mode!!!\" ascii wide\n    $a3=\"This rechecking?
