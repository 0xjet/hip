Each threat group quickly\ntook advantage of a zero­day vulnerability (CVE­2015­5119), which was leaked in the disclosure of\n[Hacking Team’s internal data. Adobe released a patch for the vulnerability on July 8, 2015. Before](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-16.html)\nthat patch was released, the groups launched phishing campaigns against multiple companies in the\naerospace and defense, construction and engineering, education, energy, health and biotechnology,\nhigh tech, non­profit, telecommunications, and transportation industries.\n\n\n-----\n\ninformation security community.\n\n# APT3’s Campaign\n\n**APT3 actors targeted at least 10 organizations in the following industries:**\n\nAerospace and Defense\nConstruction and Engineering\nEnergy\nHigh Tech\nNon­Profit\nTelecommunications\nTransportation\n\nAn example of an APT3 phishing email is below in Figure 1:\n\n**FROM: \"<first.last>\" <first.last>@perrydale.com**\n\n**SUBJECT: <Target> Analysis report­ 2015**\n\n**URLs:**\n\nhxxp://report.perrydale[.]com/ema/RR201507[.]pdf\n\nhxxp://vic.perrydale[.]com/logo2.jpg\n\nhxxp://rpt.perrydale[.]com/en/rep201507101[.]pdf\n\n_Figure 1: An example of APT3 phishing email using CVE­2015­5119_\n\nAs of July 8, all three domains observed in the URLs resolved to 194.44.130.179. Similar to APT3’s\n[activity in Operation Clandestine Wolf, the URLs redirect to JavaScript profilers and a malicious Adobe](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/06/operation-clandestine-wolf-adobe-flash-zero-day.html)\nFlash file. The Flash file downloads an obfuscated GIF, which contains a SHOTPUT payload compiled\nthe day APT3 sent the phishing emails. SHOTPUT is a DLL backdoor that that communicates over HTTP\nand may be capable of uploading or downloading files, managing processes, executing system\ncommands, and collecting system information. SHOTPUT may also be detected as\nBackdoor.APT.CookieCutter. The SHOTPUT backdoor communicates to the following command and\ncontrol (CnC) addresses, which are hardcoded into the malware:\n\npsa.perrydale[.]com\nlink.angellroofing[.]com\n107.20.255.57\n23.99.20.198\n\nThis is the third time since mid­2014 that we have observed APT3 using a zero­day, which attests to its\nability to capitalize on new exploits.\n\n# APT18’s Campaign\n\n**APT18 actors targeted at least 13 organizations in the following industries:**\n\nAerospace and Defense\nConstruction and Engineering\nEducation\n\n\n-----\n\nTelecommunications\nTransportation\n\nAn example of an APT18 phishing email is shown in Figure 2:\n\n**FROM: <various> @duwrt.com**\n\n**SUBJECT: Important:Flash Update**\n\n**Body:**\n\nDear,\n\nIf you already have Flash installed on your computer, you'll be asked to download and install\nupdate. Once the new update is installed, Flash should function normally. Update Outlook Many\nFlash problems can be solved by updating your client software to the latest version. Please verify\nthat you have all the latest updates available for your version of Adobe flash software. Here's how:\n\n1.Download update hxxp://get[.]adobe[.]com/ (masked URL: hxxp://137.175.4[.]132/index.htm)\n\n2.Click Check for Updates.\n\n3.Restart your computer after you have verified that all updates are installed. You must have\nadministrative privileges on your computer to install any Flash. Please contact your desktop\nsupport staff if you need assistance.\n\n_Figure 2: An example of APT18 phishing email using CVE­2015­5119_\n\nOnce the victim clicks the URL, the system downloads a malicious Adobe Flash (.swf) file with the\nproperties shown in Figure 3.\n\nFilename: movie.swf\n\nMD5: 079a440bee0f86d8a59ebc5c4b523a07\n\nFilesize: 214976\n\n_Figure 3: APT18 Malicious SWF Properties_\n\nUpon exploitation, a GH0ST RAT variant is delivered to the victims’ system, which calls out to a\npreviously known APT18 CnC address 223.25.233.248. GH0ST RAT is a backdoor derived from public\nsource code. It may also be detected as Backdoor.APT.Gh0stRat. The compiled source code provides\nattackers with many ways to control a victim’s system, including the ability to create, manipulate, delete,\nlaunch, or transfer files; perform screen or audio capture; enable a webcam; list or kill processes; open a\ncommand shell; and wipe event logs. However, since the source code is public, threat groups may tailor\nthe code by removing or adding functionality.\n\n# Comparing the Campaigns\n\nAPT3 and APT18 took a slightly different approach in employing the exploit, which demonstrates they\nlikely work independently. As usual, APT3 used compromised infrastructure, while APT18 relied on\nprocured infrastructure. APT3 used customized phishing emails that sometimes contained the names of\nthe targeted organizations, whereas APT18’s emails were nonspecific and likely crafted to be used on\nmultiple targets.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Opportunism\n\nThe groups demonstrated their adaptability and skill by quickly employing Hacking Team’s leaked zero­\nday before the vulnerability was patched. Both groups likely monitor information from security research to\nlearn what exploits are available and how network defenders are reacting to them. We have previously\nobserved APT3 monitoring and quickly changing tactics based on public research. After we exposed\ndetails about Operation Clandestine Wolf, APT3 changed its phishing emails, modified filenames, and\nupdated its backdoor.\n\nIn the past, APT3 and APT18 have frequently developed or adapted zero­day exploits for operations,\nwhich were likely planned in advance. Using data from the Hacking Team leak demonstrates how they\ncan shift resources—selecting targets, preparing infrastructure, crafting messages, and updating tools—\nto take advantage of unexpected opportunities like newly exposed exploits.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nFireEye maintains endpoint and network detection for CVE­2015­5119, the backdoors used in these\ncampaigns, and other tools used by these groups. Additionally, we highly recommend:\n\n[Applying Adobe’s patch for Flash immediately,](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-16.html)\nQuerying for additional activity by source addresses or email indicators,\nBlocking CnC addresses via outbound communications, and\nScope the environment to prepare for incident response.\n\n[Note: IOCs for this campaign can be found here.](https://github.com/fireeye/iocs)\n\n[This entry was posted on Mon Jul 13 09:31:00 EDT 2015 and filed under Advanced Persistent Threat,](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research.html/category/etc/tags/fireeye-blog-tags/advanced-persistent-threat)\n[Advanced Persistent Threat Detection, Advanced Persistent Threats, Blog, FireEye Threat Intelligence,](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research.html/category/etc/tags/fireeye-blog-tags/advanced-persistent-threat-detection)\n[Latest Blog Posts, Threat Intelligence and Threat Research.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research.html/category/etc/tags/fireeye-blog-tags/latest)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cyber Security Fundamentals](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/cyber-security-fundamentals.html)\n\n[Careers](https://www.fireeye.com/company/jobs.html)\n\n[Events](https://www.fireeye.com/company/events.html)\n\n[Webinars](https://www.fireeye.com/company/webinars.html)\n\n[Support](https://www.fireeye.com/support.html)\n\n[Partners](https://www.fireeye.com/partners.html)\n\n[Newsroom](https://www.fireeye.com/company/newsroom.html)\n\n[Blog](https://www.fireeye.com/blog.html)\n\n[Investor Relations](http://investors.fireeye.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Contact Us](https://www.fireeye.com/company/contact-us.html)\n\n[Communication Preferences](https://www2.fireeye.com/manage-your-preferences.html)\n\n[Report Security Issue](https://www.fireeye.com/company/security.html)\n\n[Supplier Documents](https://www.fireeye.com/company/supplier.html)\n\n### Connect\n\n\n##      \n\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FireEye)\n\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fireeye)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/fireeye)\n\n[Google+](https://plus.google.com/+Fireeye/videos)\n\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/FireEyeInc)\n\n[Glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-FireEye-EI_IE235161.11,18.htm)\n\n\nCopyright © 2015 FireEye, Inc.
