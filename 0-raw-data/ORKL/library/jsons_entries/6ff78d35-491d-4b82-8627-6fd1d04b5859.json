The reported emails direct recipients to “Vote for Trump or else!” in\nthe subject lines and indicate that the senders will “know which candidate” the recipients vote\nfor, in addition to claiming to have “gained access into the entire voting infrastructure.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Email message from October 20 found in Proofpoint data, purporting to be from the_\n_Proud Boys, threatening the recipient to ”Vote for Trump or else!”_\n\n## October 21 messages\n\n[Multiple](https://www.fastcompany.com/90566468/florida-democrats-get-threatening-emails-demanding-that-they-vote-for-trump%22%20/) [media](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/florida-alaska-trump-emails.html) [outlets have](https://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/2020/10/20/brevard-voters-threatened-emails-purportedly-proud-boys/5997458002/?fbclid=IwAR2fVEnrMjT5MDtG6TK5Vit9pu_oe2rRKHxqL03Gns1iyPf_H_21jLDES9M) [reported on these messages, and on October 21,](https://www.vice.com/en/article/88a43b/proud-boys-emails-threatening-florida-voters-appear-to-use-spoofed-email-address)\n2020, Proofpoint researchers discovered additional messages, suggesting that\nthe widespread media coverage did not deter the actor responsible for this activity.\n\nWhile the messages sent on October 20 are from “Proud Boys\n<info[@]officialproudboys[.]com>”, messages sent on October 21 are from “Proud Boys\n<info[@]proudboysusa[.]com>”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Email message from October 21, again threatening the recipient to ”Vote for Trump_\n_or else!”, with link to a Proud Boys-branded video_\n\nEmails from October 21 are sent from 162.13.192.136, an IP associated\nwith eibank[.]com. While earlier messages included no address or what appears to be the\nrecipient’s actual address, messages observed on October 21 have a placeholder value of\n“#address#”.\n\nThe URL on the last line of the message,\n“hxxps://dl.orangedox[.]com/TQ7K1cj9RVVfKRAfL6,” links to a Proud Boys-branded video\ndemonstrating a Kali Linux user filling out voter registration and absentee ballots for Alaskan\ncitizens. We only observed two intended recipients of these messages, both of whom appear\nto reside in Florida. As of this posting, the video does not appear to be available via the URL\nabove.\n\nThe video depicts registration and ballots requested through the Federal Voting Assistance\nProgram’s online portal meant to aid US service members and overseas citizens. The Kali\nuser populates request forms with data from the Alaskan voter database while claiming each\nis an active duty service member. The user then demonstrates they have repeated this\nprocess multiple times, insinuating volumes in the thousands. It’s [not](https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/laws/advisory-2014-17-procedures-fwab.shtml) [clear that this would be](https://www.fvap.gov/guide/appendix/faq)\nan effective technique to void a voter’s ballot, though attempting to register a voter in multiple\nstates could lead to confusion.\n\nUpon examination of the video’s metadata, we discovered a File Modification Date/Time of\n“2020:10:21 06:18:36-07:00” and Handler Vendor ID of “Apple”.\n\n## October 20 messages\n\n\n-----\n\nProofpoint researchers also discovered messages from October 20 in our data. When\nexamining those messages, Proofpoint researchers confirmed that some of the threatening\nemails contain the recipient’s home address, indicating that the sender has\ninformation that could be used to follow through on the threats should they choose. While we\ninitially believed these messages were targeting universities, we’ve now observed messages\nto intended recipients in the manufacturing industry, among others. We identified over a\nthousand of these messages in our data, and the messages can be broken down into two\ndistinct sets. In addition to the “Vote for Trump or else!” subject, we also observed subjects\n‘vote’, ‘voteing’ (sic) and an empty subject line.\n\n### Set One\n\nThe initial set accounts for several hundred of the messages observed with this theme. The\nformat of these messages appears to directly match the format of the voter records\n[presented on flvoters[.]com, a website operated by Tom Alciere which provides a mirror of](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/investigations/troubleshooters-investigation-voting-records/1973358/%22%20/)\nFlorida’s voter information public records.\n\nMessages in this set can be traced back to a PHPmailer script hosted on a likely\ncompromised Saudi Arabian insurance company website.\n\n_Figure 3: Sample from email headers indicating the message origin; 195.181.170.244 is a_\n_VPN (superhosting.cz)_\n\n[The actor accessed the PHPmailer script from a DataCamp Limited IP frequently used](http://datacamp.co.uk/)\nfor [malicious purposes. Notably, messages in this set address the recipient](https://www.abuseipdb.com/whois/195.181.170.244)\nas “Lastname, Firstname” and do not appear to include any further personal information.\n\n### Set Two\n\nAfter the set of messages using the compromised Saudi insurance company’s infrastructure,\nthe actor shifted to routing messages through the website of an Estonian textbook publisher,\nas [reported by Vice. Notably, messages in this wave include the recipient’s address-of-](https://www.vice.com/en/article/88a43b/proud-boys-emails-threatening-florida-voters-appear-to-use-spoofed-email-address)\nrecord. Nearly 1,500 messages were sent in this set, making it noticeably larger than the\nset exploiting the Saudi company.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Message sent through Estonian infrastructure, including the recipient’s name and_\n_address (redacted here)_\n\nBased on our observations, the actor appears to have made small changes to their sending\nscript when they shifted to exploiting the Estonian publisher. Messages sent in this set\nincluded what appears to be the recipient’s home address, while earlier messages only\nmention that the actor has the recipient’s address.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nExplicitly threatening voters to support a specific candidate is a departure from the electionthemed activity we’ve recently observed, such as impersonation of the Democratic National\n[Committee and various fraudulent voter registration portals. Previous activity used political](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/agile-threat-actors-pivot-covid-19-voter-registration-themes-phishing-lures)\nthemes to entice users to click on links or open attachments but did not appear especially\npolitically motivated. Given the threatening and personalized nature of these messages, they\ncould be sincere–though likely ineffective–attempts to carry out voter intimidation via email.\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
