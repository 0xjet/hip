While Lockbit 2.0 (103\nvictims) and Conti (45 victims) remain the most prolific threat actors, victims of CL0P\n[increased massively from 1 to 21 \" NCC Group added](https://newsroom.nccgroup.com/news/ncc-group-monthly-threat-pulse-april-2022-448500)\n\n\n-----\n\nClop s most targeted sector was the industrial sector, with 45% of Clop ransomware attacks\nhitting industrial organizations and 27% targeting tech companies.\n\nBecause of this, NCC Group's strategic threat intelligence global lead Matt Hull warned orgs\nwithin the ransomware group's most targeted sectors to consider the possibility of being this\ngang's next target and prepare accordingly.\n\nHowever, despite already leaking data from almost two dozen victims, the ransomware group\ndoesn't seem very active based on the number of submissions on the ID Ransomware\nservice.\n\n_Clop ransomware activity (ID Ransomware)_\n\n## Part of a shutdown process?\n\nWhile some of the recent victims are confirmed to be new attacks, one theory is that the Clop\ngang might finally be shutting down their operation after being inactive for so long.\n\nAs part of this process, the ransomware gang would likely publish the data of all previously\nunpublished victims.\n\n[This is similar to what the Conti group appears to be doing right now as part of their own](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-shuts-down-operation-rebrands-into-smaller-units/)\nongoing shutdown.\n\nWhether these are old or new victims will likely be confirmed if they release breach\n[notifications or publish confirmations (some of](https://attorneygeneral.nd.gov/sites/ag/files/documents/DataBreach/2022-03-14-OakdellEgg.pdf) [them have](https://therecord.media/k-12-cyberattacks-new-mexico-ohio/) [already done it).](https://www.perbit.com/newsevents/news/artikel/pressemitteilung-it-sicherheitsvorfall-perbit.htm)\n\n## Who is Clop?\n\nThe Clop ransomware gang's activity lull is easily explained by some of its infrastructure\ngetting shut down in June 2021 following an international law enforcement operation\ncodenamed Operation Cyclone coordinated by the INTERPOL.\n\n\n-----\n\nSix individuals suspected of laundering money and providing cash-out services for the Clop\n[ransomware gang were arrested by Ukrainian authorities after 21 home searches in the Kyiv](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-arrests-clop-ransomware-gang-members-seizes-servers/)\nregion.\n\n\"The overall impact to CLOP is expected to be minor,\" cybersecurity company Intel 471 told\nBleepingComputer.\n\n[While targeting victims worldwide in ransomware attacks since at least 2019 (some of its](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cryptomix-clop-ransomware-says-its-targeting-networks-not-computers/)\n[victims include Maastricht

Clop](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/indiabulls-group-hit-by-clop-ransomware-gets-24h-leak-deadline/)\n[gang was also linked to a massive wave of Accellion data breaches leading to a substantial](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/accellion-data-breaches-drive-up-average-ransom-price/)\nincrease in average ransom payments for the first three months of 2021.\n\nIn the Accellion attacks, Clop's operators only exfiltrated large amounts of data from highprofile companies using Accellion's legacy File Transfer Appliance (FTA).\n\nThe gang later used this stolen data as leverage to extort the compromised companies,\nforcing them to pay high ransom demands not to have their data leaked online.\n\nThe list of companies that had their Accellion FTA servers hacked by Clop includes, among\nothers, [energy giant Shell,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/energy-giant-shell-discloses-data-breach-after-accellion-hack/) [cybersecurity firm
