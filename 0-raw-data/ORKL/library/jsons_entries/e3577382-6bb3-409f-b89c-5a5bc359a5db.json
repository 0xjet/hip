Given its methods—and its anti-NATO\nand anti-US messages—the widely held assumption has been that Ghostwriter is yet another\n[Kremlin-led campaign. The European Union even declared at the end of September that](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/09/24/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-european-union-on-respect-for-the-eu-s-democratic-processes/)\nsome member states have “associated” Ghostwriter “with the Russian state.” As it turns out,\nthat's not quite right. According to the threat intelligence firm Mandiant, Ghostwriter's hackers\nwork for Belarus.\n\n[Mandiant first took a close look at Ghostwriter in July 2020. The group was then primarily](https://www.wired.com/story/hackers-broke-into-real-news-sites-to-plant-fake-stories-anti-nato/)\nknown for creating and distributing fake news articles and even hacking real news sites to\npost misleading content. By April 2021, Mandiant attributed broader activity to Ghostwriter,\nincluding operations to compromise the social media accounts of government officials to\n[spread misinformation and efforts to target politicians with hacking and leaking operations.](https://www.wired.com/story/mueller-indictment-dnc-hack-russia-fancy-bear/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group has long focused on undermining NATO s role in Eastern Europe, and has\nincreasingly turned to stoking political divides or instability in Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania,\nLatvia, and Germany.\n\nAt the Cyberwarcon conference in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, Mandiant analysts Ben\nRead and Gabby Roncone are presenting evidence of Ghostwriter's ties to Belarus.\n\n“The credential theft activity targeting Eastern Europe and anti-NATO information operations\nboth lined up with what we’ve seen Russia do in the past,” Read told WIRED ahead of the\nconference. Despite those familiar tactics, techniques, and procedures, Mandiant didn't make\nan attribution to Moscow at the time, because they hadn't seen specific digital links.\n\nAfter Belarus' controversial elections in August 2020, longtime president Alexander\nLukashenko retained power amid accusations that opposition leader Sviatlana\nTsikhanouskaya had actually won. The US denounced the election, and many of Belarus'\nneighbors, including Poland, made it clear that they support the Belarusian opposition.\nDuring this time, Mandiant observed a notable change in Ghostwriter's campaigns.\n\n“We saw a shift to a lot more focus on Belarus-specific issues—targeting Belarusian\ndissidents, Belarusians in the media, things that really look like they’re conducted in support\nof the Belarusian government,” Read said. \"And then we also stumbled upon technical\ndetails that make us think the operators are located in Minsk and some others that hint at the\nBelarusian military. That gets us to the point now where we’re confident in saying that\nGhostwriter has a link to Belarus.”\n\nShane Huntley, who leads Google's Threat Analysis Group, says that the Mandiant research\nfits with TAG's own findings. “Their report is consistent with what we have observed,” he told\nWIRED.\n\nAs the group's activity hinted more and more at a specifically Belarusian agenda over the\nsummer, Mandiant worked to untangle who was really behind the campaigns. Since last\nyear's election, 16 of 19 Ghostwriter disinformation operations focused on narratives that\ndisparage the Lithuanian and Polish governments, neighbors of Belarus. Two focused\nnegatively on NATO and one criticized the EU.\n\nA Ghostwriter operation in August focused on Poland and Lithuania pushed a false narrative\naccusing migrants of committing crimes. Long-simmering tensions between Poland and\nBelarus have escalated dramatically in recent weeks with the border as a flashpoint. Other\nrecent operations have alleged accidents at Lithuania's nuclear power plants, perhaps\nbecause Lithuania has long opposed the proximity of Belarus' Astravyets nuclear plant to its\nborder. State television in Belarus has picked up Ghostwriter misinformation narratives and\nrepeated them, though it's unclear whether this was the result of specific coordination or just\n\n\n-----\n\npart of a general feedback loop of Belarusian pro-government propaganda. Read also points\nout that Ghostwriter has not focused on Estonia—the one Baltic state that doesn't border\nBelarus.\n\nThough Mandiant is not publicly releasing details of its evidence, the researchers say that\ntechnical indicators connect Ghostwriter activity to the Belarusian government and\nindividuals in Minsk. Additional clues potentially reveal a specific connection to the\nBelarusian military. The researchers say that they directly observed these connections and\nalso confirmed them with outside sources. Read also notes that among the governments\nGhostwriter has targeted, the group most commonly focuses on ministries of defense rather\nthan ministries of foreign affairs, which may suggest a focus on military intelligence.\n\nLukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity researcher and consultant who has followed\nGhostwriter's influence in Eastern Europe, says that some of the group's activity, particularly\npolitical leaking operations, have been in significant in countries like Poland. “I do not know\nwhat the objectives of these operations were, but I'd risk saying that some of them were\nachieved successfully,” he says. “It is the most significant politically or militarily motivated\ncyberoperation targeting the Eastern parts of the European Union.”\n\nGhostwriter operations are not the most technically sophisticated, Read says, but the group\nseems fully independent and does not have infrastructure overlap with other known groups\nfrom what Mandiant has seen. The hackers use their own malware rather than open source\nor publicly available tools and seemingly have their own public cloud infrastructure.\n\nThe fact remains that the EU and other researchers have attributed Ghostwriter to Russia,\nbut Read says these findings aren't necessarily in conflict, especially given that governments\nmay have different visibility and evidence available to them.\n\n“There is a long political union between Belarus and Russia, so I can’t say Russia is not\ninvolved,” Read adds. “But what we have picked up is that we don’t see anything connecting\nthem right now.”\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: [Get our newsletters!](https://www.wired.com/newsletter?sourceCode=BottomStories)\n[Blood, lies, and a drug trials lab gone bad](https://www.wired.com/story/swapped-blood-faked-data-lab-gone-bad/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&itm_content=footer-recirc)\n_[Age of Empires IV wants to teach you a lesson](https://www.wired.com/story/age-of-empires-iv/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&itm_content=footer-recirc)_\n[New sex toy standards let some sensitive details slide](https://www.wired.com/story/sex-toy-standards/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&itm_content=footer-recirc)\nWhat the [new MacBook Pro finally got right](https://www.wired.com/story/macbook-pro-ports-magsafe-design/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&itm_content=footer-recirc)\nThe mathematics of [cancel culture](https://www.wired.com/story/the-mathematics-of-cancel-culture/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&itm_content=footer-recirc)\n[👁 Explore AI like never before with our new database](https://www.wired.com/category/artificial-intelligence/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&itm_content=footer-recirc)\n✨ Optimize your home life with our Gear team’s best picks, from [robot vacuums to](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-robot-vacuums/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&itm_content=footer-recirc)\n[affordable mattresses to](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-mattresses/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&itm_content=footer-recirc) [smart speakers](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-google-speakers-buying-guide/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&itm_content=footer-recirc)\n\n\n-----",
