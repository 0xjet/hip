    "plain_text": "# LuckyMouse signs malicious NDISProxy driver with certificate of Chinese IT company\n\n**securelist.com/luckymouse-ndisproxy-driver/87914**\n\nBy GReAT\n\n## What happened?\n\nSince March 2018 we have discovered several infections where a previously unknown\nTrojan was injected into the lsass.exe system process memory. These implants were\ninjected by the digitally signed 32- and 64-bit network filtering driver NDISProxy.\nInterestingly, this driver is signed with a digital certificate that belongs to Chinese company\nLeagSoft, a developer of information security software based in Shenzhen, Guangdong.\nWe informed the company about the issue via CN-CERT.\n\nThe campaign described in this report was active immediately prior to Central Asian highlevel meeting and we suppose that actor behind still follows regional political agenda.\n\n## Which malicious modules are used?\n\nThe malware consists of three different modules:\n\nA custom C++ installer that decrypts and drops the driver file in the corresponding\nsystem directory, creates a Windows autorun service for driver persistence and adds\nthe encrypted in-memory Trojan to the system registry.\nA network filtering driver (NDISProxy) that decrypts and injects the Trojan into\nmemory and filters port 3389 (Remote Desktop Protocol, RDP) traffic in order to\ninsert the Trojan’s C2 communications into it.\nA last-stage C++ Trojan acting as HTTPS server that works together with the driver. It\nwaits passively for communications from its C2, with two possible communication\nchannels via ports 3389 and 443.\n\n\n-----\n\n_NDISProxy driver and RAT work together once the installer has set up all the modules_\n\nThese modules allow attackers to silently move laterally in the infected infrastructure, but\ndon’t allow them to communicate with an external C2 if the new infected host only has a\nLAN IP. Because of this, the operators used an Earthworm SOCKS tunneler in order to\nconnect the LAN of the infected host to the external C2. They also used the Scanline\nnetwork scanner to find file shares (port 135, Server Message Block, SMB) which they use\nto spread malware with administrative passwords, compromised with keyloggers.\n\nWe assess with high confidence that NDISProxy is a new tool used by LuckyMouse.\nKaspersky Lab products detect the described artefacts. For more information please\n[contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## How does it spread?\n\nWe detected the distribution of the 32-bit dropper used for this campaign among different\ntargets by the end of March 2018. However, we didn’t observe any spear phishing or\nwatering hole activity. We believe the operators spread their infectors through networks that\nwere already compromised instead.\n\n## How does it work?\n\n### Custom installer\n\n**Installer MD5 hash** **Timestamp (GMT)** **Size** **Bits**\n\nd dff98035f80711 61b 47 83b61d 2018 03 29 07 35 55 572 244 32\n\n\n-----\n\n3cbeda2c5ac41cca0b0d60376a2b2511 2018.03.26 04:16:00 307 200 32\n\nThe initial infectors are 32-bit portable executable files capable of installing 32-bit or 64-bit\ndrivers depending on the target. The installer logs all the installation process steps in the\nload.log file within the same directory. It checks if the OS is Windows Vista or above (major\nversion equal to 6 or higher) and decrypts its initial configuration using the DES (Data\nEncryption Standard) algorithm.\n\nThe set of well-known port numbers (HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, POP3S, MSSQL, PPTP and\nRDP) in the configuration is not used, which along with the “[test]” strings in messages\nsuggests this malware is still under development.\n\nThe installer creates a semaphore (name depending on configuration) Global\\Doorndisproxy-mn and checks if the service (name also depends on configuration) ndisproxymn is already installed. If it is, the dropper writes “door detected” in load.log. The autorun\nWindows service running NDISProxy is the “door” in developer terms.\n\nThe installer also decrypts (using the same DES) the shellcode of the last stage Trojan and\nsaves it in three registry values named xxx0, xxx1, xxx2 in key\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\32ndisproxy-mn (or 64ndisproxy-mn for 64-bit hosts). The\nencrypted configuration is saved as the value filterpd-ndisproxy-mn in the registry key\nHKCR\\ndisproxy-mn.\n\n_Initial installer saves XOR-encrypted Trojan’s shellcode and DES-encrypted configuration in system registry_\n\nThe installer creates the corresponding autostart service and registry keys. The “Altitude”\nregistry value (unique ID for the minifilter driver) is set to 321 000, which means “FSFilter\nAnti-Virus” in Windows terms:\n\n### NDISProxy network filtering driver\n\n**Driver MD5 hash** **Timestamp** **Size** **Bits**\n\n8e6d87eadb27b74852bd5a19062e52ed 2018.03.29 07:33:58 40400 64\n\nd21de00f981bb6b5094f9c3dfa0be533 2018.03.29 07:33:52 33744 32\n\n\n-----\n\nad07b44578fa47e7de0df42a8b7f8d2d 2017.11.08 08:04:50 241616 64\n\nThis digitally signed driver is the most interesting artefact used in this campaign. The\nnetwork filtering modules serve two purposes: first they decrypt and inject the RAT; second,\nthey set its communication channel through RDP port 3389.\n\n[The drivers are signed with a digital certificate issued by VeriSign to LeagSoft, a company](https://www.leagsoft.com/)\ndeveloping information security software such as data loss prevention (DLP) solutions.\n\nThis driver makes extensive use of third-party publicly available C source code, including\nfrom the Blackbone repository available at GitHub.\n\n**Feature** **Public repository**\n\n\nDriver memory\ninjection\n\nNDIS network\nfiltering driver\n\nParse HTTP\npackets\n\n\nBlackbone https://github.com/DarthTon/Blackbone\n\nMicrosoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK) sample code “Windows Filtering Platform\nStream Edit Sample/C++/sys/stream_callout.c”\n\nHttp-parser https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser\n\n\nThe driver again checks if the Windows version is higher than Vista, then creates a device\nnamed \\\\Device\\\\ndisproxy-%s (where the word after “-” varies – see Appendix for all\nvariants) and its corresponding symbolic link \\\\DosDevices\\\\Global\\\\ndisproxy-%s.\n\nThe driver combines all the Trojan-related registry values from\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\32ndisproxy-mn and de-XORs them with a six-byte hardcoded\nvalue. It then injects the resulting Trojan executable shellcode into lsass.exe memory using\nBlackbone library functions.\n\nNDISProxy works as a network traffic filter engine, filtering the traffic going through RDP\nport 3389 (the port number is hardcoded) and injecting messages into it.\n\nThe communication between the user-mode in-memory Trojan and the driver goes through\nthe custom control codes used by the DeviceIoControl() Windows API function.

Code starts with a shellcode – instead of typical Windows\nportable executable files loader this malware implements memory mapping by itself.\n\nThis Trojan is a full-featured RAT capable of executing common tasks such as command\nexecution and downloading/uploading files. This is implemented through a couple dozen\nC++ classes such as CMFile, CMFile, CMProcess, TFileDownload, TDrive, TProcessInfo,\nTSock, etc. The first stage custom installer utilizes the same classes. The Trojan uses\n[HTTP Server API to filter HTTPS packets at port 443 and parse commands.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/desktop/Http/http-server-api-overview)\n\n_The Trojan is an HTTP server allowing LAN connection It uses a SOCKS tunneler to communicate with the C2_\n\n\n-----\n\ncreate SOCKS tunnels to their C2 using the Earthworm tunneler. This tool is publicly\navailable and popular among Chinese-speaking actors. Given that the Trojan is an HTTPS\nserver itself, we believe that the SOCKS tunnel is used for targets without an external IP,\nso the C2 is able to send commands.\n\n## Who’s behind it and why?\n\nWe found that this campaign targeted Middle Asian governments’ entities. We believe the\nattack was highly targeted and was linked to a high-level meeting. We assess with high\nconfidence that the Chinese-speaking LuckyMouse actor is responsible for this new\ncampaign using the NDISProxy tool described in this report.\n\nIn particular, the choice of the Earthworm tunneler is typical for Chinese-speaking actors.\nAlso, one of the commands used by the attackers (“-s rssocks -d 103.75.190[.]28 -e 443”)\ncreates a tunnel to a previously known LuckyMouse C2. The choice of victims in this\ncampaign also aligns with the previous interests shown by this actor.\n\n## Consistent with current trends\n\nWe have observed a gradual shift in several Chinese-speaking campaigns towards a\ncombination of publicly available tools (such as Metasploit or CobaltStrike) and custom\nmalware (like the C++ last stage RAT described in this report). We have also observed how\ndifferent actors adopt code from GitHub repositories on a regular basis. All this combines to\nmake attribution more difficult.\n\nThis campaign appears to demonstrate once again LuckyMouse’s interest in Central Asia\nand the political agenda surrounding the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**_Note: The indicators in this section are valid at the time of publication.
