This\ncampaign uses social engineering and decoy documents related to geopolitical affairs and relations\nbetween the Palestinian government, and references Egypt, Hezbollah, and Iran.\n\n_[Part one of this research investigates the Spark campaign, where attackers use social engineering to](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/new-cyber-espionage-campaigns-targeting-palestinians-part-one)_\n_infect victims, mainly from the Palestinian territories, with the Spark backdoor. For more information_\n_[about part one, click here.](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/new-cyber-espionage-campaigns-targeting-palestinians-part-one)_\n\nDuring the attacks, victims are infected with a previously undocumented backdoor, dubbed Pierogi by\nCybereason. This backdoor allows attackers to spy on targeted victims. Cybereason suspects that the\nbackdoor may have been obtained in underground communities rather than home-grown, as the\nevidence found in the code of the backdoor suggests it may have been developed by Ukranian-speaking\nhackers.\n\nThe tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), content, and theme of the decoy documents, as well as\nthe victimology observed in the campaign, resemble previous attacks that have targeted Palestinians. In\nparticular, these campaigns appear to be related to attacks carried out by a group called MoleRATs (aka,\n[Gaza Cyber Gang, Moonlight), an Arabic-speaking, politically motivated group that has been operating in](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0021/)\nthe Middle East since 2012.\n\n## Key Points\n\n**Cyber Espionage with a New Malware: The Cybereason Nocturnus team has discovered recent,**\ntargeted attacks in the Middle East to deliver the Pierogi backdoor for politically-driven cyber\nespionage.\n**Targeting Palestinians: The campaigns seems to target Palestinian individuals and entities, likely**\nrelated to the Palestinian government.\n**Using Geopolitically-charged Lure Content: The attackers use specially crafted lure content to**\ntrick their targets into opening malicious files that infect the victim’s machine with the Pierogi\nbackdoor. The decoy content of the malicious files revolves around various political affairs in the\nMiddle East, specifically targeting the tension between Hamas and other entities in the region.\n**Perpetrated by an Arabic-speaking APT, MoleRATs: The modus-operandi of the attackers as**\nwell as the social engineering decoy content seem aligned with previous attacks carried out by an\nArabic-speaking APT group called MoleRATs (aka Gaza Cybergang). This group has been\noperating in the Middle East since 2012.\n\n[For a synopsis of this research, check out the Molerats & Pierogis Threat Alert.](https://www.cybereason.com/threat-alert-molerats-pierogis)\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n\n-----\n\n## Infection Vector via Social Engineering\n\n[Similar to previous attacks, this campaign starts with social engineering. In one instance, it lures victims](https://www.vectra.ai/blogpost/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks)\nto open an email attachment. In others, it persuades victims to download a report about a recent political\naffair pertaining to the Middle East and specifically to Palestinian matters. In most cases, the\ndownloaded file is either an executable that masquerades as a Microsoft Word document or a\nweaponized Microsoft Word document.\n\n_Malicious file named “Reports on major developments__347678363764”, uploaded to VirusTotal from_\n_the Palestinian territories._\n\n### Backdoor Dropper File Name SHA-256\n\n 347678363764_ا�����ات ��أ ��ل �����.exe 4e77963ba7f70d6777a77c158‐\n fab61024f384877d78282d31ba7b‐\n Translation: Report on major bac06724b68 developments_347678363764.exe\n\n Ente‐ 094e318d14493a9f56d56b44b30fd396af8b296 laqa_hamas_32_1412_847403867_rar.exe 119ff5b82aca01db9af83fd48\n\n Translation: Hamas_32th_Anniver‐ sary__32_1412_847403867_rar.exe\n\n final_meet‐ 050a45680d5f344034be13d4fc3a7e389ce‐ ing_9659836_299283789235_rar.exe b096bd01c36c680d8e7a75d3dbae2\n\n Employee-entitlements-2020.doc b33f22b967a5be0e886d479d47d6c9d35c6639 d2ba2e14ffe42e7d2e5b11ad80\n\n Congratulations_Jan-7_78348966_pdf.exe 4be7b1c2d862348ee00bcd36d7a6543f1eb‐ b7d81f9c48f5dd05e19d6ccdfaeb5\n\n## Decoy Content\n\nAs soon as the victim double-clicks on the dropper, they are presented with the decoy document.

It enables the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software))\nattackers to spy on victims using rather basic backdoor capabilities. While it is unknown at this point\nwhether the backdoor was coded by the same members of the group behind the attacks, there are\nindications that suggest that the malware was authored by Ukranian-speaking malware developers. The\ncommands used to communicate with the C2 servers and other strings in the binary are written in\nUkrainian.\n\n[This is why we chose to name the malware Pierogi, after the popular East European dish.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Strings embedded in the backdoor binary that show Ukranian words._\n\nThe backdoor has the following capabilities:\n\nCollects information about the infected machine.\nUploads files to the attackers’ server.\nDownloads additional payloads.\nTakes screenshots from the infected machine.\nExecutes arbitrary commands via the CMD shell.\n\nIn addition to spy features, the backdoor also implements a few checks to ensure it is running in a safe\nenvironment. Specifically, it looks for antivirus and other security products.\n\n1. The backdoor queries Windows for installed antivirus software using WMI: SELECT * FROM\n\n_AntiVirusProduct_\n2. It looks for specific antivirus and security products installed on the infected machine, such as\n\nKaspersky, eScan, F-secure and Bitdefender.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Strings of security products found in the backdoor code._\n\n## Persistence Mechanism\n\nThe backdoor achieves persistence using a classic startup item autorun technique:\n\n1. A shortcut is added to the the startup folder:\n\n_C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup._\n2. Once the user logs on to the infected machine, the shortcut points to the file binary location in the\n\n_C:\\ProgramData\\ folder._\n\n_The backdoor persistence shown via Sysinternals Autoruns tool._\n\nThe GUID generated by the malware is saved in a file called GUID.bin. This file is created in the same\nfolder as the binary of the backdoor (C:\\ProgramData\\GUID.bin).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Contents of the GUID.bin file generated by the backdoor._\n\n## C2 Communication by the Pierogi Backdoor\n\nThe backdoor has rather basic C2 functionality implemented through a predefined set of URLs:\n\n**1. Sending machine information and a heartbeat to the C2:**\nURL: hxxp://nicoledotson[.]icu/debby/weatherford/Yortysnr\n\nThe information sent to the C2 includes:\n\n**cname: computer name, username, and GUID**\n**av: Name of detected antivirus**\n**osversion: version of the operating system**\n**aname: the location of the malware on the infected machine**\n\n_Sending basic information about the infected machine_\n\n\n-----\n\n**2. Requesting commands from the C2 server:**\n\nURL: hxxp://nicoledotson[.]icu/debby/weatherford/Ekspertyza\n\n_Ekspertyza means expertise or examination in Ukranian. There are 3 basic commands coming from the_\nserver in the form of md5 hashes:\n\n### MD5 hash Plain text command\n\n Dfff0a7fa1a55c8c1a4966c19f6da452 cmd\n\n 51a7a76a7dd5d9e4651fe3d4c74d16d6 downloadfile\n\n 62c92ba585f74ecdbef4c4498a438984 screenshot\n\n_Receiving command from the server to upload a screenshot of the infected machine’s screen._\n\n**3. Uploading data (mainly screenshots) to the C2:**\n\nURL: hxxp://nicoledotson[.]icu/debby/weatherford/Zavantazhyty\n\n_Zavantazhyty means to load or download in Ukranian. This command is used to upload collected data to_\nthe C2 server. For example, in some instances the backdoor uploads screenshots taken from an infected\nmachine, as can be seen in the example below.\n\n|MD5 hash|Plain text command|\n|---|---|\n|Dfff0a7fa1a55c8c1a4966c19f6da452|cmd|\n|51a7a76a7dd5d9e4651fe3d4c74d16d6|downloadfile|\n|62c92ba585f74ecdbef4c4498a438984|screenshot|\n\n\n-----\n\n_The backdoor uploads a screenshot of the infected machine to the C2 server._\n\n**4. Removing information:**\n\n**URL: hxxp://nicoledotso[.]icu/debby/weatherford/Vydalyty**\n\n_Vydalyty means to remove or delete in Ukrainian. The malware can delete various requests based_\n**on the command below.**\n\n_Excerpt from the code that handles deletion requests from the C2 server._\n\n## Recent Infrastructure\n\nThe records of the domains and IPs involved in this campaign seem to show that the attackers created a\nnew infrastructure specifically for this campaign. The domains were registered in November 2019 and\noperationalized shortly after, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_PassiveTotal UI: An activity timeline of the malicious domain Linda-callaghan[.]icu._\n\n_An activity timeline of the malicious domain Nicoledotson[.]icu._\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn part two of this research, we examined the Pierogi campaign. Cybereason suspects this campaign\ntargets Palestinian individuals and entities in the Middle East, specifically directed at those in the\nPalestinian government. The threat actors behind the campaign use social engineering to infect their\nvictims with the Pierogi backdoor for cyber espionage purposes.\n\nThe threat actor behind the attack invested considerable time and effort to lure their victims with\nspecially-crafted documents that target Palestinian individuals and entities in the Middle East. In our\nanalysis, we reviewed the TTPs and the decoy content, and pointed out the similarities between previous\nattacks that have been attributed to MoleRATs, an Arabic-speaking, politically motivated group that has\noperated in the Middle East since 2012.\n\nThe Pierogi backdoor discovered by Cybereason during this investigation seems to be undocumented\nand gives the threat actors espionage capabilities over their victims. Based on the Ukranian language\nembedded in the backdoor, Cybereason raises the possibility that the backdoor was obtained in\nunderground communities by the threat actors, rather than developed in-house by the group.\n\nLearn how to protect against these types of attacks with the right roles for SIEM and EDR.
