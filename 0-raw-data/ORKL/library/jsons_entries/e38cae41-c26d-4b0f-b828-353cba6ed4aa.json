This includes activity we attribute to the Chinese state[sponsored groups RedFoxtrot and](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/3H5r94YaJsZu) [Calypso APT, as well as 2 additional clusters using the](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/xg6bccGiVhgS)\n[Winnti and](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/15sBu8EpKYJK) [PlugX backdoors that we have been unable to link to established groups at this](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/2PXNy0GbIe7m)\ntime. Notably, data exfiltration activity for these intrusions, particularly the Calypso APT\nactivity and the unknown threat actor using the Winnti malware, spiked throughout August\n[and September 2021, coinciding with major geopolitical events such as the withdrawal of US](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/2HFIDBwPaFXB)\ntroops and a resurgence in Taliban control. This focus on intelligence gathering targeting one\nof Afghanistan’s largest telecommunications providers is likely in part driven by the Chinese\nCommunist Party’s (CCP) [purported desire to expand influence within Afghanistan under](https://www.ft.com/content/7ceb9e3b-bd6e-43fe-bb86-80353249e6ac)\nrenewed Taliban rule. The telecommunications firm offers a hugely valuable platform for\nstrategic intelligence collection, be it for monitoring of downstream targets, bulk collection of\ncommunication data, as well as the ability to track and monitor individual targets. Moreover,\nthe [Chinese government considers the telecommunications sector to be of strategic](https://www.recordedfuture.com/china-digital-colonialism-espionage-silk-road/)\nsignificance in countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\n## Timeline of Activity\n\nInsikt Group tracks and regularly reports on a range of Chinese state-sponsored threat\n[activity groups, exemplified by our recent RedFoxtrot reporting in June 2021. One of the](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redfoxtrot-china-pla-targets-bordering-asian-countries/)\nmethods used to track these groups combines adversary infrastructure detection methods\nand Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) data. Through our tracking of malicious\ninfrastructure associated with known Chinese state-sponsored actors, we identified multiple\nconcurrent intrusions targeting Roshan over the past year linked to 4 separate activity\ngroups:\n\nThe earliest identified activity targeting Roshan is linked to the suspected Chinese\nstate-sponsored group Calypso APT, and has been ongoing from at least July 2020 to\nSeptember 2021, and was first reported by Insikt Group in August last year.\nMore recently, the same Roshan server was identified communicating with RedFoxtrot\nPlugX command and control infrastructure from at least March to May 2021. During this\ntime, RedFoxtrot was also identified targeting a second Afghan telecommunications\norganization.\n\n\n-----\n\nTwo more clusters were also engaged in the targeting of the same Roshan mail server.\nThese are referred to as the Winnti and PlugX clusters respectively and are outlined\nfurther in the sections below. Both of these clusters appear unrelated to each other or\nthe Calypso APT and RedFoxtrot activity, but we have been unable to link them to a\ntracked activity group at this time.\n\n**_Figure 1: Timeline of Roshan NTA data exfiltration events versus Afghanistan geopolitical_**\n_reporting (Source: Recorded Future)_\nThe targeting of the same organization by activity groups under the same state sponsorship\nis not unusual, particularly for Chinese adversaries. Many of these groups have separate\nintelligence requirements and, due to the scale of the Chinese intelligence apparatus, are\noften not coordinated in their targeting and collection. In this case, as visible in Figure 1,\nthere has been an increase in data exfiltration events associated with the Calypso APT and\nWinnti intrusions in August and September 2021. This is indicative of both historical strategic\ncollection targeting Afghanistan as well as a further concentration of activity in line with major\ngeopolitical events.\n\nAfghanistan is strategically important to China for several reasons, particularly in the wake of\nthe US withdrawal. For one, the PRC likely seeks to increase its influence within Afghanistan\nto prevent regional instability and extremism from spreading into the bordering Xinjiang\nUyghur Autonomous Region of the PRC, as well as to other Central Asian countries. These\nissues raise national security concerns and a need to protect PRC interests in the region,\nincluding major Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investments. The US withdrawal also presents\nthe PRC with opportunities for major new BRI-linked and extractive industry projects within\nAfghanistan.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n**_Figure 2: Chart of infrastructure used in Roshan intrusions (Source: Recorded Future)_**\nAs shown in Figure 2, the compromised Roshan server has been identified communicating\nwith a range of adversary C2 infrastructure, particularly associated with the PlugX malware\nfamily commonly used by Chinese state-sponsored groups. The section below contains a\nbreakdown of the intrusion activity by group.\n\n## RedFoxtrot\n\nIn June 2021, Insikt Group [reported on RedFoxtrot activity targeting government, defense,](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redfoxtrot-china-pla-targets-bordering-asian-countries/)\nand telecommunications organizations across South and Central Asia since at least 2014.\nWe linked this activity group to Unit 69010 of the People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support\nForce (PLASSF) Network System Department (NSD) located in Ürümqi, Xinjiang, through lax\noperational security employed by a suspected RedFoxtrot operator. The group uses an array\nof bespoke malware variants commonly associated with Chinese groups, such as IceFog,\n\n\n-----\n\nQUICKHEAL, and RoyalRoad, as well as other more widely available tools often used by\nChina-linked threat actors, including Poison Ivy, PlugX, and PCShare.\nIn follow-up analyses in July and September 2021, we identified RedFoxtrot abandoning\nlarge amounts of operational infrastructure following public disclosure and reported on\nseveral newly identified victims across government and defense sectors in India and\nPakistan. RedFoxtrot activity targeting Roshan ceased before our public reporting on the\ngroup in June 2021 and was linked to the following PlugX command and control\ninfrastructure:\n\n**C2 Domain** **Last Seen C2 IP Address** **Last Seen Date of Activity**\n\nrandomanalyze.freetcp[.]com 143.110.250[.]149 April 4, 2021\n\ndarkpapa.chickenkiller[.]com 149.28.139[.]86 May 5, 2021\n\n\ndhsg123.jkub[.]com 159.65.152[.]7\n143.110.242[.]139\n\n**_Table 1: RedFoxtrot PlugX Indicators from Roshan Intrusion_**\n\n## Calypso APT\n\n\nApril 21, 2021\n\n\n[In March 2021, Insikt Group reported on the Calypso APT conducting a mass exploitation](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-group-calypso-exploiting-microsoft-exchange/)\ncampaign targeting Microsoft Exchange servers using the ProxyLogon exploit chain (CVE[2021-26855, CVE-2021-27065), alongside several other Chinese state-sponsored groups.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/)\nOne of the PlugX C2 domains highlighted in this activity, www.membrig[.]com, remains active\nand is linked to ongoing intrusion activity targeting Roshan.\n\n**C2 Domain** **Last Seen C2 IP Address** **Last Seen Date of Activity**\n\nwww.membrig[.]com 103.30.17[.]20 September 12, 2021\n\n### Table 2: Calypso APT indicators from Roshan intrusion\n\n## Unknown Winnti Cluster\n\nThe Winnti backdoor has historically been used by several Chinese state-sponsored groups,\n[including APT41/Barium, APT17, and most recently a group tracked by Insikt Group as TAG-](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan/)\n[22. The Winnti backdoor is commonly](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer) [associated with activity linked to multiple groups of](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2019/07/24/apt17-is-run-by-the-jinan-bureau-of-the-chinese-ministry-of-state-security/)\nloosely connected private contractors operating on behalf of China’s Ministry of State\n[Security (MSS). In September 2020, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged 5 Chinese](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer)\nnationals linked to APT41, which had access to Winnti malware, with conducting widespread\nintrusion operations targeting over 100 victims globally.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn relation to the Roshan targeting, we identified a high level of data exfiltration activity from\nthe targeted Roshan server and the Winnti C2 45.76.144[.]44, from at least August 17 to\nSeptember 12, 2021. We have been unable to link this Winnti C2 infrastructure with a known\ngroup, but it is very likely separate from the RedFoxtrot and Calypso APT activity highlighted\nabove.\n\n## Unknown PlugX Cluster\n\nFinally, the same Roshan mail server was also identified communicating with an additional\nPlugX C2 server from April to August 2021. This PlugX C2, 45.86.162[.]135, is linked to the\nAustralia-based PS hosting reseller Crowncloud.\n\n## Outlook\n\nSeveral Chinese state-sponsored groups remain highly active across Central Asia, often\noperating in an uncoordinated manner, likely due to differing tasking and chains of command.\nLike other geopolitical flashpoints such as India and the South China Sea, Afghanistan is\nlikely to remain a prime target for Chinese government intelligence collection following the\nUS’s withdrawal and the Taliban’s takeover. Always a prime target of cyberespionage activity,\ntelecommunications organizations are at particularly high risk within these regions due to the\nintelligence value of the data they hold. Additionally, the Chinese government considers it a\n[strategic priority to influence the telecommunications sectors of countries participating in the](https://www.recordedfuture.com/china-digital-colonialism-espionage-silk-road/)\nBelt and Road Initiative, giving it increasing leverage in the debate over global internet\ngovernance.\n\n\n-----",
