networks\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/german-govt-warns-of-apt27-hackers-backdooring-business-networks/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/german-govt-warns-of-apt27-hackers-backdooring-business-networks/)**\n\nSergiu Gatlan\n\nBy\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nJanuary 26, 2022\n08:00 AM\n0\n\nThe BfV German domestic intelligence services (short for Bun des amt für Ver fas sungs schutz) warn of ongoing attacks coordinated by the APT27 Chinese-backed hacking group.\n\nThis active campaign is targeting German commercial organizations, with the attackers\nusing the HyperBro remote access trojans (RAT) to backdoor their networks.\n\n[HyperBro helps the threat actors maintain persistence on the victims' networks by acting as](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.hyperbro)\nan in-memory backdoor with remote administration capabilities.\n\nThe agency said the threat group's goal is to steal sensitive information and may also\nattempt to target their victims' customers in supply chain attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV (Federal Office for the\nProtection of the Constitution)) has information about an ongoing cyber espionage\ncampaign by the cyber attack group APT27 using the malware variant HYPERBRO against\n[German commercial companies,\" the BfV said.](https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/SharedDocs/kurzmeldungen/DE/2022/2022-01-26-cyberbrief.html)\n\n\"It cannot be ruled out that the actors, in addition to stealing business secrets and\nintellectual property, also try to infiltrate the networks of (corporate) customers or service\nproviders (supply chain attack).\"\n\n[The BfV also published indicators of compromise (IOCs) and YARA rules to help targeted](https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/SharedDocs/publikationen/DE/cyberabwehr/2022-01-bfv-cyber-brief.pdf)\nGerman organizations to check for HyperBro infections and connections to APT27\ncommand-and-control (C2) servers.\n\n_HyperBro infection chain (BfV)_\n\n## Breaching networks via Zoho and Exchange servers\n\n[APT27 (also tracked as TG-3390, Emissary Panda, BRONZE UNION, Iron Tiger, and](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0027/)\nLuckyMouse) is a Chinese-sponsored threat group active since at least 2010 and known for\nits focus on information theft and cyberespionage campaigns.\n\nThe German intelligence agency says APT27 has been exploiting flaws in Zoho AdSelf\nService Plus software, an enterprise password management solution for Active Directory\nand cloud apps, since March 2021.\n\nThis aligns with previous reports of Zoho ManageEngine installations being the target of\nmultiple campaigns in 2021, coordinated by nation-state hackers using tactics and tooling\nsimilar to those employed by APT27.\n\n\n-----\n\nThey first used an [ADSelfService zero-day exploit until mid-September, then switched to an](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-and-cisa-warn-of-state-hackers-exploiting-critical-zoho-bug/)\n[n-day AdSelfService exploit, and started exploiting a ServiceDesk bug beginning with](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/state-hackers-breach-defense-energy-healthcare-orgs-worldwide/)\nOctober 25.\n\n_Zoho ManageEngine campaigns (Unit 42)_\nIn these attacks, they successfully compromised at least nine organizations from critical\nsectors worldwide, including defense, healthcare, energy, technology, and education,\naccording to Palo Alto Networks researchers.\n\n[In light of these campaigns, the FBI and CISA issued joint advisories (1,](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-259a) [2) warning of APT](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-336a)\nactors exploiting ManageEngine flaws to drop web shells on the networks of breached\ncritical infrastructure orgs.\n\nAPT27 and other Chinese-backed hacking groups were also linked to attacks exploiting\ncritical ProxyLogon bugs in early March 2021 that allowed them to take over and steal data\nfrom unpatched Microsoft Exchange servers worldwide.\n\nUS and allies (the European Union, the United Kingdom, and NATO) officially blamed China\nin June for last year's widespread Microsoft Exchange hacking campaign.\n\n### Related
