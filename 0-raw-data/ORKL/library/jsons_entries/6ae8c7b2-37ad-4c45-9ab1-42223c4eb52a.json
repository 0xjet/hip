An IP addresses in\nGuangdong, China was associated with some of the domains.\n\nBoth individuals have a long history of purchasing APT3 infrastructure. Who do they work for\nand where do their orders come from?\n\n**Boyusec**\n\nWell, the answers to those questions are reasonably easy to find. Wu Yingzhuo (吴颖卓) and\nDong Hao (董浩) are both shareholders in the same company.\n\n[This listing is for a](http://company.xizhi.com/GS570782da1f98cc03038b468b/) [Chinese cyber security firm called 博御信息 (or Boyusec – the Guangzhou](http://www.boyusec.com/)\nBoyu Information Technology Company, Ltd) that was licensed in December 2013 and is\nbased in Guangdong. It lists both 吴颖卓 and 董浩 as major shareholders.\n\n\n-----\n\nCompany listing showing 吴颖桌 and 董浩 as shareholders of Boyusec\n**The Ministry of State Security**\n\nOn the 29th of November 2016, freebeacon.com reported that Pentagon intelligence officials\n[had identified Boyusec as being a contractor for the Chinese Ministry of State Security](http://freebeacon.com/national-security/pentagon-links-chinese-cyber-security-firm-beijing-spy-service/)\n(MSS). The MSS is one of China’s Intelligence Services and is an active player in their Cyber\nprogramme.\n\n\n-----\n\n**The conclusion?**\n\nEither a Chinese InfoSec company called Boyusec, known to be involved with Chinese\nIntelligence Cyber operations, has two shareholders with the same names as two apparant\nAPT3 actors, or Boyusec is APT3.\n\n\n-----",
