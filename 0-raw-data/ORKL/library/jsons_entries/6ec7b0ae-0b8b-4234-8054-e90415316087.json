In this post, we**\n\n**will provide an overview of the original Dark Seoul campaign in 2013, the similarities and**\n\n**differences in tactics, the malware used, as well as attempt to answer the question of ‘why**\n\n**now’?**\n\n**In March 2013, the country of South Korea experienced a major cyberattack, affecting tens of**\n\n**thousands of computer systems in the financial and broadcasting industries. This attack was**\n\n**[dubbed ‘Dark Seoul’; it involved wreaking havoc on affected systems by wiping their hard drives,](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/03/20/south-korea-cyber-attack/)**\n\n**in addition to seeking military intelligence.**\n\n**The attack was initially thought to be attributed to North Korea, by way of a Chinese IP found**\n\n**during the attack, but no other strong evidence of North Korea’s involvement has been**\n\n**produced since then. In June 2013, McAfee published a report detailing the chronology and**\n\n**[variance of the Dark Seoul campaign, but renamed it ‘Operation Troy’. The report analyzed the](http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-dissecting-operation-troy.pdf)**\n\n**entirety of the purported attack campaign, beginning in 2009 using a family of tools dubbed**\n\n**‘Troy’. McAfee further attributed two groups to the campaign: the NewRomanic Cyber Army**\n\n**Team and The Whois Hacking Team; both groups believed to be state sponsored. Since the**\n\n**publication of that report, no other activity involving either group or the tools have been detected**\n\n**or shared publically.**\n\n**That is, until now.**\n\n**[Using the Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus threat intelligence platform, we identified several](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/platforms/subscriptions/autofocus.html)**\n\n**samples of malicious code with behavior similar to the aforementioned Operation Troy campaign**\n\n**dating back to June 2015, over two years after the original attacks in South Korea. Session data**\n\n**revealed a live attack targeting the transportation and logistics sector in Europe. The initial**\n\n**attack was likely a spear-phishing email, which leveraged a trojanized version of a legitimate**\n\n**software installation executable hosted by a company in the industrial control systems sector.**\n\n**The modified executable still installs the legitimate video player software it claims to contain, but**\n\n**also infects the system. Based on deep analysis of the Trojan’s behavior, binary code, and**\n\n**previous reports of similar attacks, we have concluded that these samples were the same as the**\n\n**original tools used in the Dark Seoul/Operation Troy attacks. It is likely the same adversary**\n\n**group is involved, although there is currently insufficient data to confirm this conclusion.**\n\n**The malicious code was delivered via the following two executable names, packaged together in**\n\n**a zip archive file:**\n\n**[redacted]Player_full.exe**\n\n**[redacted]Player_light.exe**\n\n**Both executables present themselves as legitimate installation programs offered by the**\n\n**industrial control systems organization, providing video player software for security camera**\n\n**solutions. When either sample was executed, the malware dropped and subsequently executed**\n\n**the actual video player it disguised itself as.**\n\n**The new malware variant, which we call TDrop2, proceeds to select a legitimate Microsoft**\n\n**Windows executable in the system32 folder executes it, and then uses the legitimate**\n\n**executable’s process as a container for the malicious code, a technique known as process**\n\n**hollowing. Once successfully executed, the corresponding process then attempts to retrieve the**\n\n**second stage payload**\n\n|Col1|POSTED BY: Bryan Lee and Josh Grunzweig on November 18, 2015 4:25 PM|\n|---|---|\n|153||\n|LLiikkee|FILED IN: Malware, Threat Prevention, Unit 42 TAGGED: AutoFocus, Dark Seoul, Operation Troy, TDrop, TDrop2, WildFire While researching new, unknown threats collected by WildFire, we discovered the apparent re- emergence of a cyber espionage campaign thought to be dormant after its public disclosure in June 2013.

Additionally, the**\n\n**following custom alphabet is used for base64 encoding that takes place after the encryption of**\n\n**the data:**\n\n**_3bcd1fghijklmABCDEFGH-J+LMnopq4stuvwxyzNOPQ7STUVWXYZ0e2ar56R89K/_**\n\n**Once decoded and decrypted, we see the following command being provided:**\n\n**_tick 7880_**\n\n**_systeminfo & net view & netstat -naop tcp & tasklist & dir /a_**\n\n**_“%userprofile%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Outlook” & dir /a “%temp%\\*.exe” & dir_**\n\n**_“%ProgramFiles%” & dir “%ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft Office”_**\n\n**_1018; 60_**\n\n**The initial ‘tick’ string is hardcoded and must be present for the malware to accept the**\n\n**subsequent command(s). In this case, the initial commands are used to perform basic**\n\n**reconnaissance on the infected host and return the results to the attacker, then initialize a sleep**\n\n**period of 60 seconds**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Analysis of the malicious code identified reveals the distinct similarities in behavior and**\n\n**functionality to the original Dark Seoul/Operation Troy toolset.**\n\n**The use of the custom base64 alphabet was observed in the following twelve samples that were**\n\n**specified within the Operation Troy whitepaper:**\n\n**2e500b2f160f927b1140fb105b83300ca21762c21bb6195c44e8dc613f7d7b12**\n\n**353a1288b1f8866af17cd7dffb8b202860f03da8d42e6a76df7b5212b3294632**\n\n**4a11e0453af1155262775e182e5889fc7141f0fa73f8ac916fd83d2942480437**\n\n**4df8a104c9d992c6ea6bd682f86c96ddffab302591330588465640eb8a04fa2d**\n\n**591eb8ce448ab95b28a043943bd9de91489b5ebb1ef4a7b2646742b635fa93f2**\n\n**8e84f93fd0e00acba0e1c4b1c1cef441fa33ad5c95e7bacbd7261ee262be039a**\n\n**971fd9ae00ffce5738670ec26bca6cf3ad1a4c47d133cee672470381c559b5a7**\n\n**a30eb5774fe309044467a6a90355cc69d62843cc946eb9cc568095a053980098**\n\n**b323d4c3bef99742dda27df3bf07a46941932fec147daaa4863440c13a21ec49**\n\n**c1a7b065555b833f76d87b54f1dd2ede90bce9268325e8524b372c01f3ef4403**\n\n**c1cf57f2bdec8c9b650dfaba0427d12c39189330efab8cd9aa4dbfbd6735cf40**\n\n**dbb0f061dd29b3f69d5fe48e3827e279bd8bdcf584f30fe35b037074c00eb840**\n\n**The majority of these samples had debug strings that referenced the ‘TDrop’ malware family,**\n\n**which is likely the predecessor to the malware observed in this campaign and the source of the**\n\n**name ‘TDrop2’.**\n\n**The new variant also uses a distinct string decryption routine, which was also observed in a**\n\n**number of Operation Troy samples.**\n\n**The same string decryption routine was also observed in 64-bit samples from the Operation**\n\n**Troy campaign.

The**\n\n**behavior of the analyzed malicious code made references to decoding a PE file from both a .gif**\n\n**and .jpg URL.
