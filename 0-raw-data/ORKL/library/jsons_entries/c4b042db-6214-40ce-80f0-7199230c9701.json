The stager led us to\nthe group’s distribution point, where we found malicious toolsets. We have analyzed the malware and were able to see\nrelations between various campaigns that have been described by other cybersecurity firms over the course of the last\nyears. Based on publicly published research and our own investigations, we can say with high confidence that the modus\noperandi and the malicious toolset show a strong link to a group related to Mustang Panda, which has previously been\n[reported as a Chinese APT group. The group has been known for gathering intelligence on Mongolia, and further](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-june-mustang-panda/) Asian\n[countries, and most recently was suspected of targeting European entities.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/05/mustang-panda-targets-europe.html)\n\nThe distribution point, an FTP server, is also used as a transition point for exfiltrated victim data, before the data is moved\nto an unknown location. We continue to observe new data being uploaded and moved from the point, meaning the\ncampaign is still active, and has been going on for some time. Gigabytes of data are moved around, and the amount of\ndata indicates severe compromise of many high-profile targets in Myanmar. The data types include various office\ndocuments and PDFs, stolen browser profiles, webmail dumps and even sound recordings. Browsing profiles were also\nextracted which can provide access to other infrastructures, services, and private data of the victims. Most of the stolen\ndata seems to be in Burmese making it challenging to analyze. The sensitive data is mainly being collected from devices\nused by the Myanmar government, state administration, police, army, significant public organizations, or companies, and\nincludes data related to diplomatic meetings, court hearings, military information, contracts and more.\n\n_Disclaimer: We have only seen partial snapshots of the exfiltrated data as they are deleted shortly after being moved_\n_from the distribution point, so it should be noted that the information we have on victims may be inaccurate or incomplete._\n_Most of the documents are in Burmese, therefore, a language barrier has also to be taken into account. Finally, due to_\n_the limited scope and the sheer volume of the data, some assumptions had to be made during the research process. We_\n_have reached out to local CERTs, informing them of our findings._\n\n## Victimology\n\nNearly all of the victims have close ties to Myanmar and it seems that both the Burmese government and opposition\ngroups are being targeted. We have seen data originating from various departments of several Burmese ministries. Even\nthe Office of the State Administrative Council has been targeted. The government breach is not isolated to Myanmar –\nwe have also seen Myanmar embassies among targets, for example, the embassy in Serbia. The data also contained\n\n\n-----\n\ndumps of a mailbox used to communicate in 2016 and 2017, as well as in 2020 with visa applicants from all around the\nworld. These messages contained scans of passports from citizens and diplomats from various countries, such as China,\nAustralia, Czech Republic, France, Israel, Netherlands, UK, and USA.\n\nAfter such an extensive list of targets, it ought to be little surprise that Myanmar Police Force is also among the targets.\nEven some higher profile departments, such as the Office of the Information Police Chief or the Department of Special\nInvestigation, seem to have been breached. Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces) is also not an exception – we have\nseen victims from the Bureau of Air Defense, Myanmar Army Engineering, and the United Wa State Army.\n\nPolitical NGOs and the government’s opposition are also on the list of victims. It is possible that the list is even more\nextensive as we may not be able to find a straightforward association to said organizations as we would expect more\ncommon usage of personal computers or computers that are not centrally maintained by an IT department. We have\nseen data from devices belonging to the Karen National Union, Center for Diversity and National Harmony, National\nReconciliation and Peace Centre, Ethnic Nationalities Affairs Center, and even the Union Civil Service Board.\n\n## Exfiltrated Data\n\nThe most common file types being exfiltrated by the group are Microsoft Office documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx, etc.), PDF\ndocuments, and plain text files. Other file types exfiltrated include audiovisual data in various forms, including sound\nrecordings (.mp3), and pictures (.jpg, .png, etc.) or drawings. Emails, including entire conversations are also exfiltrated.\n\nIt appears that the attackers are also looking for and collecting data from browser profiles from various web browsers,\ne.g. Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and more, a serious threat to victims’ privacy. The stolen browser profiles can provide\naccess to other infrastructures, services, and the victims’ private data of the victims. The attackers are extracting\ninformation about browsing history, stored credentials (personal and work), credit cards, used tokens, and valid cookie\nsessions. Consequently, poorly secured services, such as services without two-factor authentication or without a safe\ncookie policy, can be easily abused by attackers. Attackers can steal the identity of victims and can use their email,\nFacebook, Telegram, or other accounts to collect additional information about the victim and their family, friends, and\nactivities.\n\nHighly sensitive data is being collected from victims’ computers, and, in most cases, these are computers used by the\nMyanmar government, state administration, police, army, significant public organizations, or companies. This in some\ncases included sensitive data and information belonging to international citizens and diplomats who have interacted with\ntargeted departments.\n\nThe documents, and audiovisual data being exfiltrated by the group is massive. The files include everything from:\n\nEmail dumps including visa applications and scans of passports belonging to citizens and diplomats from various\ncountries, such as China, Australia, Czech Republic, France, Israel, Netherlands, UK, and USA\nA seating plan for the meeting between former US Ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson and\nMyanmar’s leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing\nMyanmar’s constitution with proposed changes\nInvitations for diplomatic meetings, meeting programs, calls, and talking points\nReports, maps, and screenshots from the Signal messaging app related to the UWSA (United Wa State Army)\nData from the Office of the Chief of Myanmar Air Defense Force, including meeting minutes, full staff/rank lists,\nphoto IDs (some with fingerprints), salaries, personal details of employees’ families\nPeace treaty documents\nInterrogation reports\nContracts\nCourt hearings\nTown plans\nContact information for police officers, including their names, addresses, telephone numbers, and salaries\nTranscripts of meetings around politics, and elections\nMeeting minutes and audio recordings of meetings between Myanmar senior officials (Prime minister, Chairman of\nState Administrative Council) and the President of Tatarstan\nMilitary buildings drawings, including munitions storage, oil storage and aerial photos of proposed sites\n\n\n-----\n\nInternational banking records and records and transfers from supporters to a refugee group\n\n## Ties to known campaigns\n\nSince getting our hands on the distribution point, we have established links between known campaigns already publicly\nreported and what we have discovered. This gives us clues as to how resourceful the group may be and will also help us\nassess its modus operandi.\n\n[We have found files strongly resembling (or even matching) samples and their relations described in a blogpost by ESET](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/23/mustang-panda-hodur-old-tricks-new-korplug-variant/)\naround the Korplug variant dubbed Hodur. The campaign they described was targeting various government organizations\nin Mongolia, Vietnam, and Myanmar, along with politically-oriented NGOs. This is in alignment with the victimology of the\nstolen data we have seen on the distribution point. Hodur was attributed to the Mustang Panda group. The related part of\nthe uncovered toolset we analyzed also contained a USB launcher written in Delphi, similar to the one seen\naccompanying the Hodur variant of Korplug analyzed by ESET. This installer is responsible for firing up the infection\nchain leading to a variant of Korplug RAT.\n\nSimilarly, we’ve found similarities to operations attributed to LuminousMoth both in structure and purpose. For instance,\n[we have seen a very similar structure as the one described in Bitdefender’s research on the LuminousMoth group.](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/labs/luminousmoth-plugx-file-exfiltration-and-persistence-revisited/)\nNamely, the usage of the same binaries for sideloading, same pattern for exfiltration – using RAR for collection and a\nsideloaded library for exfiltration via Google Drive. Perhaps the most common pattern was the usage of a USB launcher\nwritten in Delphi that was attributed to Mustang Panda, which was also described in Bitdefender’s research.\n\n[In some cases, we have seen some unreliable links to older campaigns such as Operation NightScout, a rather old](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/02/01/operation-nightscout-supply-chain-attack-online-gaming-asia/)\n[KMPlayer supply-chain attack, or](https://www.eset.tw/html/309/201309/) [Operation Harvest. Namely, binaries used for sideloading or names of encrypted](https://origin-uat-blogs.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/operation-harvest-a-deep-dive-into-a-long-term-campaign/)\npayloads matched the ones used in these old campaigns. Nevertheless, the specific payloads differ significantly, so while\nsome of these were attributed to Mustang Panda, the similarity could also be coincidental.\n\n## Toolset overview\n\nThe storage we have discovered contains many archives with various tools to be downloaded by infected victims. We will\nuse names of these archives to impose basic structure on the data we have found. It is worth noting that these names\nare partially consistent in successive versions. For instance, we have found an archive KKL which was later on\naccompanied by another version with a slightly different configuration called KKL1.\n\nSome archives contained complete toolsets, whereas others only had single purpose tools in them that were meant to be\nused in connection with other tools; for instance, one contained a keylogger that obviously lacked any exfiltration\nfunctionality. This provides a strong indication that the tools are intended to be used modularly. We will build upon that\nand first talk about the usual Mustang Panda theme – Korplug. Then we’ll get to the more specific tools and end with the\nsingle purpose tools. Notably, nearly all the tools, aside from Korplug, its loaders, and Delphi installers, haven’t been\ndescribed before. The RAT written in Go (JSX) or the modular backdoor (US_2) deserve an extra mention due to their\ncomplexity\n\nFrom the data we have seen, we conjecture that the main exfiltration tools are variants of tools contained in archives\nnamed GDU, which use Google Drive for the exfiltration. Since we haven’t seen any exfiltration tool that uses the\ndistribution point directly and the path on the server of exfiltrated files contains gd, we presume that the responsible\ngroup uses some other tools to move files from various Google Drives to the distribution point we saw.\n\nA brief look at the toolsets brings up another interesting fact: almost all the files show approximately (up to a few cases\nwithin seconds) a seven or eight hour offset between the compilation timestamp and the “last modified” timestamp of the\nfile itself. Since the compilation timestamp is usually in UTC and the archives use the local time for the contents’ last\nmodification date, this places us at UTC-8 and UTC-7. Therefore, we presume that the build setup operated in a time\nresembling Pacific Standard Time (PST) and Pacific Daylight Time (PDT), used on the West Coast of the United States.\nThere are a few caveats – SE3 and SE4 contain files that were compiled on November 1, 2021 and still have an eight\nhour offset even though none of the countries using PST/PDT transitions to PST that early (both USA and Canada\ntransition to PST a few days later).\n\n\n-----\n\nThere is also a file with an obviously spoofed compilation timestamp. HT3 contains a DLL Vender.dll whose compilation\ntimestamp dates more than a month after the last modification date. This further weakens hypotheses that build upon\ntimestamp offsets. Unfortunately, we have no further leads explaining this outlier. The latest version of the uploader\n(multiUpload.exe), whose usage was spotted at the beginning of June, has a compilation timestamp of January 3, 2020.\nThis is also very likely spoofed as analyses of the previous versions of this tool show clear evolution and, according to\ntheir respective timestamps, they were all compiled in April 2021. Not to mention that the corresponding infrastructure\nwas only created at the end of May 2022.\n\nThe folder /pub/god, which contained the toolset archives, was removed on June 25, 2022. On the same day, a new\nfolder /pub/god1 was created with two files to which we didn’t have read access. Two days later, the new folder was gone\nand /pub/god appeared again with a subset of the original tools.\n\n### Variations on Korplug\n\nThe first group of tools that we’ll introduce are various versions of Korplug. The binaries used for side-loading were\nalready seen before. Even though the loaders were mostly new, they were rather uninteresting. A common theme was a\nDelphi binary that served as a launcher to be executed from an infected USB drive. As we’ve already mentioned, a\nsimilar installer was previously seen in campaigns attributed to Mustang Panda. It just executes the Korplug loader from\na folder named “Kaspersky” that is on the very same USB drive. See the diagram below (based on a toolset from an\narchive named BMD) for more details.\n\nNote the usage of the folder name “Kaspersky” and usage of “Symantec” in the names of the executables; since the\nlauncher relies on social engineering tricks, it depends on a common strategy using seemingly legitimate file names to\ndispel any doubts concerning the content.\n\n_Contents of an archive called BMD. Archive YK41 follows the same structure, with ShellselDb.dat being replaced with_\n_hp_ui.xslbcdsj and without the Delphi launcher._\n\n\n-----\n\nThere were also simpler infection chains, containing just a signed clean binary, a loader to be side loaded, and an\nencrypted Korplug. These were contained in archives WD, 127C, and 1260M. The latter interestingly used the\n_OleView.exe binary which then side-loaded the ACLUI.dll that decrypted and executed ACLUI.DLL.UI. The same signed_\nbinary, which surprisingly also has the same name of the encrypted payload, was used in the KMPlayer supply-chain\nattack in 2013. The accompanying research was only published in Chinese, likely due to the attack being limited to a few\ndevices.\n\n### Exfiltration toolset\n\nThe exfiltrated data on the server in /pub/gd folder showed perfect correlation to the data produced by GDU toolsets\n(GDU_OLD, GDU, GDU1, GDU2, GDU1_NEW, GDU3, GDUPIZ). These tools collect the files on the victim’s disk, pack\nthem into an archive whose name is prefixed with the victim’s ID and upload that archive onto a Google Drive. We\npresume that the name GDU is an acronym for Google Drive Uploader. While the tools themselves were technically\nrather simple, the exfiltration process and their evolution piqued our interest.\n\nThe analysis of the exfiltration process brought up several interesting observations. A few days after May 24, 2022, the\nday we started systematically monitoring Google Drives used for the exfiltration, we started to see more frequent token\nchanges and new features being implemented. These features mitigated possible downtime caused by the migration to a\nnew token. Since Google Drive has extensive logging functionality and the tokens have to be present on the infected\ndevices, it is only a reasonable expectation that access to these drives is monitored to some extent.\n\nOn the contrary, we have not seen such behavior with the distribution point. This could be attributed to the fact that the\ndistribution point is never exposed by the toolsets, which brings us to the assessment that the group presumes the\ndistribution point to be secret or not worth monitoring.\n\n_Timeline of GDU exfiltration toolsets_\n\n**Version overview**\n\nThe oldest version GDU uses RAR executable to collect the data and an encrypted rar.dat to store parameters for the\nRAR binary. Starting from GDU_OLD, they migrated to their own collector piz.exe (this functionality was later moved to a\nDLL to be side-loaded) and retained an encrypted rar.dat where they stored their configuration. These toolsets also rely\non two optional configuration files that are backed up by hard-coded values: token.dat containing an encrypted token for\nGoogle Drive and time.ini that contains last execution date along with the victim’s ID. The setup and the choice of\nbinaries for side-loading bears resemblance to the LuminousMoth campaigns and tooling.\n\n\n-----\n\n_An archive GDU that contains a version relying on RAR instead of piz.exe for data collection._\nThe exfiltration process is usually handled by a variant of MyUpload.dll that is supplemented by the aforementioned\nconfiguration files. Quite recently, a new version of GDU1 has appeared on the distribution point (which we’ll call\n_GDU1_NEW) which came with its successor multiUpload.exe. multiupload.exe eschews hard-coded tokens and makes_\nthe exfiltration process more resilient to disruptions.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Archive GDU_OLD that uses its own collector piz.exe to collect potentially interesting files before the exfiltration._\nThe version we are calling GDU_OLD is basically the same as GDU1 and GDUPIZ, the most significant difference being\na different PE being used for side-loading. GDU1 and GDUPIZ rely on CefSub.exe and subsequently on CefBrowser.dll\ninstead of AtlTracetool.exe. GDUPIZ also uses a slightly different approach to execute the file collection tool piz.exe – the\nversion included in this folder is in fact a renamed clean binary spoololk.exe which in turn side-loads vntfxf32.dll. This\nmalicious binary implements the file-collecting functionality formerly contained in piz.exe. GDU2 is basically the same as\n_GDUPIZ._\n\nOn June 8, 2022, we saw a new GDU1 toolset on the distribution point. This time MyUpload.dll has been upgraded to\nprovide redundancy in the exfiltration process. It no longer uses token.dat but rather uses a Github repository as its\nsource for the token. If this fails, there are two backups – one using HTTP PUT to www.watercaltropinfo[.]com with Basic\nHTTP Authorization (123:123). The other sends the data via HTTPS POST to m.watercaltropinfo[.]com. The collector is\nthe same as in GDUPIZ. GDU3 uses basically the same process but uses different PE for side-loading (FwcMgmt.exe).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tokens**\n\nA special chapter is devoted to Google Account tokens that are used in these tools, partially because our research may\nhave forced the group’s hand to refresh the tokens once they discovered that we knew of their Google Drives. The fact\nthat after each token decommission, every client had to have the token updated and that GDU toolsets do not have any\nremote update functionality suggests that these toolsets have to be accompanied by other tools that provide this update\nfunctionality. We have noticed a longer delay between the decommissioning of the token from May 29, 2022 and before a\nreplacement token was being distributed. Its distribution coincides with the time a new version of GDU1_NEW was\nreleased. It’s exactly this version that has introduced new functionality in the exfiltration tool, namely smoother token\nswapping and failsaves for cases when Google Drive exfiltration fails. Therefore, we presume that this delay was caused\nby the development of this new functionality.\n\n**Source** **Refresh Token** **Metadata**\n\n\n_GDU/GDU_OLD_ 1//030YFi1XWWVY2CgYIARAAGAMSNwFL9Ir_I6Aqhg4gn3UWyi3I5J_6q4VxHPYNkit3x9RtlpVkFCEOD4KUE2u7NghS0hx5nPU8Y\n\nDistribution point 1//0clbh_CVKereiCgYIARAAGAwSNwF-L9IrtPxC9ztonaeeq2gTUwZTVa8f8ILvDYM8dyVVjmmKmNr5Pnsi27iMjLll2dxbDRxUQs\n\n_GDU1/GDU2/GDUPIZ_ 1//0cZLNy7GH0LknCgYIARAAGAwSNwF-L9IrV7aXKTZbWQM1aqXkjX0ph25dTZngOYAUlAXHB1NvCorgw62XI_TXsWNrK98KBYfbpA\n\nDistribution point 1//0e29aixufumhCCgYIARAAGA4SNwFL9IrX2w0GnjBQe4g5hQWKJlXjIQF7XZBnQ9VKArYhJVwOayZq9AdG8YHbsptTN5DhfXI2E\n\nGithub 1//0ewRnXWCf2AunCgYIARAAGA4SNwFL9IradANDPAvIqPOaIfReqT1fQ0GO5A9FnUhdpdI0Q0V1IRye5RbTihcGQbbHKgDc02xfM\n\n**Temporal analysis of exfiltrated data**\n\n\nFirst seen:\n22.4.2021Not\naccessible\n\nFirst seen:\n22.4.2021Not\naccessible\n\nFirst seen:\n17.3.2022Our\nfirst access:\n24.5.2022Usable\nuntil: 26.5.2022\n\nFirst seen:\n29.5.2022Our\nfirst access:\n29.5.2022Usable\nuntil: 3.6.2022\n\nFirst seen:\n8.6.2022Our first\naccess:\n8.6.2022Still\nusable\n\n\nWe can also have a look at the metadata of the exfiltrated archives. What is rather unsurprising are the upload times\nwhich closely coincide with Burmese business hours – a smaller peak in the morning and a huge peak in the afternoon.\nNote that Myanmar is in UTC+6:30 time zone and China, presumed land of origin of Mustang Panda, is in UTC+8.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat is more interesting are events produced by the group itself – transfers from Google Drive onto the distribution point\nand deletion of files from the distribution point. The huge peak is around 18:00 MM time which coincides with the end of\nthe work day in Myanmar. The spread of starts of upload windows is negligible, leading us to the presumption that the\ntransfer is automated. We have seen a few archives being placed in the wrong directories which could indicate that the\ntooling is still under development or there’s still some manual work involved… Usually, the files have accumulated during\nthe day on Google Drive and were transferred to the distribution point in the evening MM time.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs we already mentioned in the introduction of uncovered tools, we have found quite a lot of files that were missing\nsomething. By that we mean that on their own, they were either lacking communication functionality or implemented\nsome techniques that were useless without being accompanied by another payload. Interestingly, while these were also\nusing side-loading, they were not relying on external encrypted files, making their execution flow straightforward with 2point graphs. For the sake of brevity, we will list these in a table:\n\n**Archive** **Clean executable** **SideLoaded DLL** **Purpose (high-level)**\n\nMG/MG44 dabs.ex/44.ex SensorAware.dll fingerprinting/remote shell\n\nAUD mcsync.ex mcaltlib.dll audio recording\n\nCHR browser.ex browser_elf.dll Cookie dumping\n\nT3YK ygfdt.exe corecrl.dll remote shell\n\nUC melt_64.exe libmlt-6.dll UAC bypass\n\nKKL/KKL1 mscorsvw.exe mscorsvc.dll (contains KBE.dll) clipboard stealer, keylogger\n\n_Archive KKL contained a straightforward stealer in KBE.dll that was also hard-coded (in an encrypted form) in_\n_mscorsvc.dll from which it was unpacked after side-loading. The newer KKL1 was practically the same._\nThere are also a few standalone files such as x.ex in archive X which composes logs of registry entries (Run), services,\nand scheduled tasks along with checking all signatures of executable files in %WINDIR%. Archive NB contains nb.dat\nwhich is just the nbstat utility executable. There was also a coinminer in the archive INFO along with its encrypted\nconfiguration file.\n\nAn interesting utility is DISK2 (and its variant DISKM); it is responsible for monitoring the system drive for any changes.\nBoth are accompanied by a configuration file that defines which files are of interest and where such files should be\ncopied to. It also notifies its C&C server about these files via an encrypted message over HTTP. There is also a version\nof this tool named MF20211228 that does not contain any configuration file and does not copy files anywhere, it just\nsends messages to the C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Contents of an archive DISK2. This toolset is responsible for monitoring the system drive for any changes in files defined_\n_by its configuration._\n\n### Oddballs in the collection\n\n**JSX**\n\nJSX archives (JSX86 and newer JSX861 for 32 bit version and JSX64 and newer JSX641 for 64 bit version) deserve a\nseparate mention as they use a rather uncommon setup; a JavaScript file is at the beginning of the chain and instead of\nside-loading, the respective DLL is launched as a service. mozload.dll is a RAT written in Go that uses HTTPS and\nwebsockets for its communication. Interestingly, the RAT uses TLS Client Authentication; see Appendix A.1 and\nAppendix A.2 for the private key and the certificate.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The execution flow of the packages from JSX archives._\n\n**HT3**\n\n_HT3 simply does not fall into any of the previous categories – it is a backdoor with external configuration accompanied_\nwith a shellcode loader and UAC bypass.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Execution flow of HT3. Note that it contains both 32 bit and 64 bit versions of an UAC bypass tool._\n\n**SE**\n\nNow we are finally getting to a more complex setup. These archives include several versions with very similar structures\nand sometimes with varying payloads. Functional changes are presented below; note that these do not include changes\nin side-loading which will be discussed later on. All versions feature a few evasion tricks that use registry tricks to hide\nfiles and file extensions.\n\nVersion Version changes\n\nSE1 Uses volume name for USB installer executable\n\nSE3/SE4/SSE Uses Delphi launcher (the one attributed to Mustang Panda), persistence integrated into\n_LPVDPOCX.OCX (equivalent of facesdk.dll from SE1)_\n\nSE5 Uses volume name for USB installer executable, rollbacks to old USB installer\n\n\n-----\n\nSE6 No significant functional changes\n\nSE7 No significant functional changes\n\n_SE3 and therefore also SE4 and SSE (which are mostly the same) use vivaldi.exe and vivaldi_elf.dll for its evasion_\nmodule. Also, FacialFeatureDemo.exe and facesdk.dll are replaced by Symantecs.exe and LDVPOCX.OCX; the latter\nintegrating persistence into itself instead of having it in a separate module. Interestingly, the USB installer has been\nreplaced with one similar to the one in the archive BMK; a Delphi launcher that executes Symantec.cmd which is actually\n_Symantecs.exe. These versions are also the only ones that have renamed 3 of 4 payload bundles (using csdkset.dat for_\nbackdoor, EdrEpmpCStorages.dat for USB installer, and PchEpmpCStorages.dat with WTSAPI32.dll). Confusingly,\n_WTSAPI32.dll does not seem to be used anywhere and will be used for side-loading by later versions when the USB_\ninstaller replacement is roll-backed.\n\n_SE6 and SE7 abuse old Avast’s proxy executable wsc_proxy.exe to side-load wsc.dll which serves as the dispatcher._\nAside from this change, there are no other significant changes to the functionality.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The schema of_\n\n_contents and the control flow of SE1. In newer versions, the persistence module is integrated in the dispatcher._\n\n**U5_2**\n\nThe last complex toolset that we will present is from the archive U5_2. Most of the functional code is encrypted and\nbundled in AtiVir.csc. With the exception of a chain to a removable drive watcher, all the parts share similar XOR keys:\n_user_panda_%section_name%; a rather interesting choice if the toolset really belongs to Mustang Panda._\n\n\n-----\n\nAn interesting part of the toolset is a file install_.exe that reads a file from a given path, takes the serial number of the\nvolume where the file is located, computes MD5 hash from the serial number and changes the first bytes of the file to the\nhex-encoded computed hash value.\n\n_The schema of_\n\n_contents and the control flow of U5_2._\n\n## Server infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\nThe distribution point is an FTP server located in Malaysia that is accessible without a password (username anonymous,\npassword is empty). We have also encountered a different FTP server in late 2020 containing very similar archives to the\nones we now know contain exfiltrated data. Unfortunately, we did not have enough information to process the archives it\ncontained. We presume that these two FTP servers were closely related or that even the current FTP server may be\nsuccessor of the one we found previously.\n\nWe have noticed that the FTP server has stopped responding in October. Fortunately, the server itself was still alive and\nthe distribution has migrated to using HTTP instead of FTP. They also started using HTTP Authorization; nevertheless,\nthey have reused a weak username:password combination (123:123). This has caused a downtime of a few days in our\ntracking, but with a quick fix, we’ve managed to get back on track. Presumably, this might have been another attempt to\nfoil our tracking attempts.\n\nOur telemetry data also revealed another server in Russia. A client from Myanmar tried to download an archive XYZ from\nit via HTTP. Upon further inspection, the archive was found to be identical to XYZ from the aforementioned FTP server.\nWe have tried to crawl the server for archives and files we have already seen on the FTP server and found the following\ntoolsets:\n\n**Archive on the HTTP server** **Matching archive on the FTP** **Note**\n\ngdupiz.rar GDU Retrieved from our telemetry\n\nxcrs.exe X Discovered by crawling\n\njsx861.rar JSX861 Discovered by crawling\n\nThe fact that the affected client is from Myanmar, and the fact that the server contains some parts of the described toolset\nstrongly indicates that it is part of the same campaign. Nevertheless, since at least one archive was renamed, we were\nunable to fully enumerate its contents. Similarly, we were not able to verify whether the server contains exfiltrated data.\n\n### C&C infrastructure\n\n**JSX RAT**\n\nThe JSX RAT attempts to communicate with 103.169.90[.]132 using TLS client authentication. The certificate (see\nAppendix A.2) is hard-coded and we can try to use it to confirm related infrastructure. Looking at the server certificate\ndata, we see that it imitates a real hosting company.\n```\nCommon name:    blue.net\nCity, country:   San Francisco, CA, US\nFingerprint (sha1): e0adf667e287b0051988dda2b85e7541d7532703\nSelf-signed\n\n```\nInterestingly, the C&C’s certificate had the exact same subject as the client certificate. Searching for other servers that\nuse the same certificate yielded a couple more servers. Furthermore, we were able to confirm that the majority of these\nservers are running the same C&C software because they accept the RAT’s hard-coded client certificate.\n\nA server at 118.31.166[.]5 seems to be an outlier among these servers with port 4433 being exposed. Since it is the\noldest one using the same certificate and the server exhibits the same communication traits on that port, we suspect that\nit might be a development server.\n\nTwo of these servers were open to RDP connections with a certificate that had o9c[.]pg as its CN (Common name). We\ntried to go further using these certificates to uncover further candidates for C&Cs. The timeline of uncovered servers is\nbelow:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Timeline of servers using the discovered certificates. Blue ones use a certificate with blue[.]net CN, red ones use o9c[.]pg_\n_as CN, purple ones have both. The highlighted line corresponds to JSX RAT C&C._\nThese are servers using the same certificate:\n\n**IP** **Geo** **Notes**\n\n103.169.90[.]132 MY Original C&C Ports: 443, 22, 53, 3389\n\n45.79.409[.]10 US Suspected RAT C&C on port 443\n\n118.31.166[.]5 CN Suspected RAT C&C on port 443, different response codes\n\n181.215.246[.]173 MY\n\n39.104.52[.]188 CN Suspected RAT C&C on port 443\n\n45.56.90[.]127 US Suspected RAT C&C on port 443\n\n154.204.176[.]249 HK\n\n47.244.2[.]17 HK Suspected RAT C&C on port 443, RDP\n\n47.96.236[.]105 CN\n\n134.122.129[.]170 HK Suspected RAT C&C on port 443\n\n172.105.158[.]102 US Suspected RAT C&C on port 443, RDP\n\n192.46.213[.]63 IN Suspected RAT C&C on port 443\n\n\n-----\n\n_Overview on the servers with ties to JSX RAT C&C._\nThese are RDP servers sharing the same certificate as the two C&Cs with open RDP port:\n\n**IP** **Geo** **Notes**\n\n47.75.123[.]100 HK\n\n47.242.171[.]26 HK\n\n47.57.87[.]221 HK\n\n172.105.118[.]92 SG\n\n172.105.159[.]130 US\n\n47.244.2[.]17 HK Is also on the previous list.\n\n47.242.95[.]126 HK\n\n8.210.16[.]197 HK\n\n172.104.92[.]7 JP\n\n45.33.34[.]11 US\n\n45.79.102[.]41 US\n\n47.57.108[.]231 HK\n\n194.195.240[.]87 DE\n\n\n-----\n\n47.56.65[.]198 HK\n\n8.210.128[.]37 HK\n\n172.105.158[.]102 US Is also on the previous list.\n\n47.57.110[.]128 HK\n\n47.242.6[.]26 HK\n\n23.92.26[.]127 US\n\n47.75.183[.]119 HK\n\n**Other C&C servers:**\n\n**Folder** **Geo** **C&C** **Notes**\n\nDISK2/DISKM/MF20211228 RU 188.127.249[.]169 Stealer\n\nHT3 MY 45.121.147[.]172 Korplug\n\nJSX MY 103.169.90[.]132 RAT\n\nMG/MG44 SG 23.106.122[.]81 Remote shell\n\nSE4/SE5/SE6/SE7 SG 91.245.253[.]72 Backdoor (ZIPDLL.dll)\n\nSEE MY 103.91.66[.]116 Backdoor (ZIPDLL.dll)\n\nT3YK MY 111.90.148[.]95 Remote shell\n\nU5_2 MY 103.117.141[.]202 RAT\n\n\nYK51LOW MY\nN/A\n\n\nmod.mmgpms[.]com\ntxt.mm-film[.]com\n\n\nBackdoor\n\n\n1260M US 45.134.83[.]4 Korplug\n\nGDU1_NEW/GDU3 – https://github.com/YanNaingOo0072022/View2015 Encrypted Google Drive\ntoken\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt is not very often we stumble upon such a stash of samples that is used to distribute malware to infected devices;\nespecially when we are talking about tools that are strongly correlated with a notorious APT group. We have shown links\nto multiple previously published research around campaigns both using tools and TTPs, providing us with high\nconfidence that the threat actor in question is Mustang Panda.\n\nThe exfiltrated data indicates that the toolsets that we have found were actively used around Myanmar. For instance, we\nhave found audio recordings that corresponded to the audio recording tools we have identified in the archive named\n_AUD. Although many tools were simplistic in their nature and sometimes also in chosen obfuscation methods, some_\narchives contained tools which seem to deserve further analysis; be it due to their complexity or technical\nimplementation.\n\nWhat was really surprising was the sheer scale of the compromitation. We have identified many high-profile government\ntargets, some opposition entities along with a few NGOs. It is worth noting that given the sheer volume of data and the\nlanguage barrier, we have only been able to associate some of the victims with a specific organization. This means that\nthe list of targets is likely incomplete and should be considered as approximate. Nevertheless, the daily rate of gigabytes\nof exfiltrated data should be enough to give a strong hint on the scale of the operation.\n\n## Appendix\n\n\n-----\n\n### C&Cs\n\n**Folder** **C&C**
