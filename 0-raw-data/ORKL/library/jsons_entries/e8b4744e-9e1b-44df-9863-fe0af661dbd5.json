    "plain_text": "# Year of the Gopher\n\n##### A 2020 Go Malware Round-Up\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\nMalware written in Go has been steadily increasing in the last few\n\nyears. During this time we have seen both nation state-backed and\n\nnon-nation state threat actors adopt Go into their toolset. This report\n\noutlines the uses of Go malware by these threat actors during 2020.\n\nBefore 2020, a Russian nation state-backed threat actor had been\n\nusing their Go variant of Zebrocy. In 2020, we saw a return of this\n\nmalware in targeted attacks against Eastern European countries.\n\nAnother Russian nation state-backed threat actor was attributed to a\n\nmalware called WellMess that is written in Go. According to the UK's\n\nNational Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), it was used in attacks against\n\norganizations that were part of COVID-19 vaccine research. WellMess\n\nhas been around for a couple of years but before the NCSC’s report,\n\nno attribution to a known threat actor had been made in the public. A\n\nChinese nation state-backed threat actor utilized a new loader written\n\nin Go to execute their malware in some campaigns, and a new threat\n\nactor included two malware written in Go in attacks against Tibetan\n\nindividuals.\n\nOn the non-nation state-backed front, crypters, stealers, remote\n\naccess trojans (RATs), botnets, and ransomware were used. Some\n\nbotnets active before 2020 were still active while some new ones\n\nemerged. Some started to target Linux environments. For example,\n\nnew samples of [IPStorm were discovered attacking Linux machines](https://www.intezer.com/blog/research/a-storm-is-brewing-ipstorm-now-has-linux-malware/)\n\ninstead of Windows ones. The majority of botnets targeting Linux\n\nmachines installed cryptominers or commandeered the machine to\n\ntake part in distributed denial of service (DDoS) botnets. Windows\n\nmachines were targeted by ransomware written in Go. During the\n\nyear, some new ransomware were used in so-called Big Game Hunting\n\nattacks. Nefilim and EKANS infected Whirlpool and Honda respectively.\n\nIt’s likely that the number of Go malware will continue to increase.\n\nWe have seen threat actors targeting multiple operating systems\n\nwith malware from the same Go codebase. Traditional Antivirus\n\nprograms have had a hard time identifying Go malware due to\n\nmany factors. A detection method based on code reuse has shown\n\nto be effective, especially when it comes to detecting when malware\n\nfamilies are targeting new platforms. It's likely that attacks from Go\n\nmalware against cloud environments will increase as more valuable\n\nassets are moved to the cloud. Using the security features provided\n\nby the hosting providers will not be enough and specialized runtime\n\nprotection solutions will be needed.\n\n#### Introduction\n\n[Go is an open-source programming language that was developed in](https://golang.org/doc/faq#Origins)\n\n2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson at Google. It\n\nwas released to the public in November of 2009. The motivation for\n\ndeveloping a new language stemmed from the frustrations of working\n\nwith current programming languages. As CPUs weren't getting\n\nfaster by increasing the number of clock-cycles anymore. Instead\n\nmore speed started to be obtained by adding more cores, allowing\n\nfor more execution in parallel. This evolution in hardware had not\n\nbeen reflected well in the common programming languages. While\n\nlanguages such as C, C++ and Java provide functionality for executing\n\nthings in parallel on multiple cores, they provide programmers with\n\nlittle help to do it efficiently and safely.\n\nThe programmers at Google set out to design a new programming\n\nlanguage that would provide \"first class\" support for concurrency or\n\nparallelism easily and safely. The goal was also to combine the ease\n\nof programming in an interpreted language with the efficiency and\n\nsafety of a statically typed and compiled language. As it was designed\n\nat Google to be used for network services running as part of Google's\n\ninfrastructure, network support was also important.\n\n\nTo provide the feeling of programming in an interpreted language, Go\n\nuses garbage collection and handles all memory management. All Go\n\nbinaries include an extensive library called the runtime, this results in\n\nGo binaries being larger in size compared to a similar program written\n\nin C that has been statically linked. The library handles the garbage\n\ncollection, scheduling of execution threads and all other critical\n\nfeatures of the language. While it is called the runtime, it is more like\n\n_libc for C that has been statically compiled with the binary than for_\n\nexample the Java runtime. Go binaries are compiled to native machine\n\ncode, but can also be compiled to JavaScript and WebAssembly.\n\nVersions 1.4 and earlier of the mainline compiler were implemented\n\nin C but with the version 1.5 release in 2015, the compiler was fully\n\nwritten in Go and self-hosting. The move to a self-hosting compiler\n\n[brought a huge improvement to the user experience with regards to](https://dave.cheney.net/2015/03/03/cross-compilation-just-got-a-whole-lot-better-in-go-1-5)\n\ncross-compiling. Before when the C based compiler was used, you\n\nneeded to have a C compiler for the target operating system and\n\narchitecture installed on the machine where the code was compiled.\n\nVery much in the same way as when cross-compiling C code for\n\ndifferent targets. From release 1.5 and onwards, cross-compiling\n\nto different operating systems and architectures is achieved by just\n\nindicating to the compiler what it should compile for. No special\n\ncompiler for the target is needed. Go can achieve this by not being\n\ndependent on libraries on the host machine to perform for example\n\nsyscalls. The functionality otherwise provided by libc is provided and\n\nhandled by the standard library for Go. There is one limitation to this\n\nease of cross-compilation and it is when Go programs need to interact\n\nwith libraries written in C via its foreign function interface (FFI). The new\n\nfeatures and solutions have resulted in programmers adopting Go for\n\n[new projects. In 2016, TIOBE awarded Go the \"Programming Language](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)\n\nof the Year\", an award given to the language that has had the highest\n\nrise in rating. As software developers have started to adopt the use\n\nof Go for its features, it should not come as a surprise that malware\n\nauthors have also started.\n\nIn July 2019, Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 [released an analysis of](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/the-gopher-in-the-room-analysis-of-golang-malware-in-the-wild/)\n\nmalware found in the wild that was written in Go. The study found that\n\nbetween 2017 and 2019 an increase of 1944% more samples were\n\nfound in the wild. This quantified a trend that was easy to spot. Before\n\n2019, spotting malware written in Go was more a rare occurrence\n\nand during 2019 it became a daily occurrence. The majority, 92% of\n\nthe malware analyzed in the report targeted Windows, while 4.5%\n\ntargeted Linux and 3.5% macOS. One thing that has been observed is\n\nthe adoption of Go by pen-testing teams for the development of their\n\ntooling. This was also prominent in the study by Unit 42. The most\n\ncommon type of malware family was either an open-source or pen\ntesting backdoor. This was followed by coinminer, stealer, and botnet.\n\nThis report covers the activity of known malware written in Go that\n\nwere active during the year 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Nation State-Backed Threat Actors\n\nThe adoption of Go by nation state-backed threat actors hasn't been as prominent as can be seen with non-nation state\nbacked threat actors. It may be due to them staying with what they believe is true and tested and the advantages Go\n\nprovides are not needed by the groups. With a more focused targeting, the need for malware that can be compiled for\n\nvaried architecture and operating systems from the same code base is not needed. While few APT groups have included\n\nGo in their toolset, there are some exceptions. During 2020, at least three new nation state-backed threat actors were\n\nattributed using malware written in Go.\n\n##### APT28 - Zebrocy\n\nIt may not have come as a surprise when the first Zebrocy written in Go was discovered in May 2018. The Zebrocy malware,\n\nknown to be used by Sofacy, has been implemented in AutoIT, C++, C# and Delphi to name a few programming languages\n\nbefore. The Go version was used in multiple waves throughout 2018 and 2019.\n\nIn November 2020, we discovered two new samples of the Go implementation of Zebrocy. The samples had overlapping\n\ncode with older Zebrocy samples, as can be seen in Figure 1.\n\n###### Figure 1: Code similarity detected by Intezer Analyze between the new Zebrocy sample and older samples.\n\nEarlier in October, a government ministry of Kazakhstan had been\n\ntargeted in a spear-phishing attack that was used to deliver a Delphi\n\nversion of Zebrocy within a Virtual Hard Drive (VHD) image. A few\n\nweeks later, the same VHD image was uploaded to VirusTotal from\n\nthe same country containing a Go version of Zebrocy. One possible\n\nscenario is that the initial attempt did not work and the threat actor\n\nswitched from the Delphi version, which had been used throughout\n\nthe Fall, to the Go version as they believed it might have been detected\n\nby Antivirus software.\n\nWhile the initial Go version of Zebrocy wasn't obfuscated, the later\n\nones have been. Below is a representation of the source code layout\n\nfor the version used against Kazakhstan. As can be seen in the\n\nsnippet, most of the function names have been obfuscated. The code\nsnippet below has been generated by the tool redress from the _Go_\n\n_Reverse Engineering Toolkit. For more information on how this data is_\n\nproduced, see Appendix A.\n\n\n-----\n\nA few weeks later a similar phishing lure was discovered that appeared\n\nto have been used to target a government ministry of Azerbaijan. This\n\nlure also consisted of a VHD file containing the Go version of Zebrocy\n\nand a PDF document. The PDF documents were presentation slides\n\nabout _Sinopharm International Corporation. Sinopharm is one of the_\n\ncompanies in China that during the phishing campaign was working\n\non a vaccine for COVID-19. Their vaccine was undergoing phase three\n\nclinical trials but had already been given to nearly one million people.\n\n##### APT29 - WellMess and WellMail\n\nWellMess is a malware that was first reported by [LAC and](https://www.lac.co.jp/lacwatch/pdf/20180614_cecreport_vol3.pdf) [JPCERT](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2018/07/malware-wellmes-9b78.html)\n\nback in 2018. It was reported that attacks had been observed in\n\nJapan and that both samples targeting Windows and Linux machines\n\nhad been observed. At the time, no attribution of the attacks was\n\ngiven. For nearly two years, WellMess was just a \"bot\" that was being\n\nobserved arriving in waves. The attention to WellMess changed in\n\nJuly 2020, when the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in the\n\nUK attributed the malware to APT29. As part of the report, NCSC\n\ndisclosed that the malware had been used, together with a similar\n\nmalware called WellMail, to target organizations involved in COVID-19\n\nvaccine development. The report did not include any proof or data to\n\nsupport the attribution to APT29 and security vendors had a hard time\n\n[validating the connection. For example, Kaspersky Labs findings point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeTYLRCwnFo)\n\nmore in the direction of a new Chinese threat actor while Cisco Talos\n\n[published that it could see weak links to either APT28 or DarkHotel.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/08/attribution-puzzle.html)\n\n[A month later, PwC released a follow up report. By using the Program](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/wellmess-analysis-command-control.html)\n\nDatabase (PDB) paths in some of the WellMess samples, they found\n\nanother sample from the same developer that had been uploaded\n\nto VirusTotal. The [sample acts as an intermediate C2 server for](https://twitter.com/IntezerLabs/status/1295757824870539265)\n\nWellMess. The intermediary receives commands from threat actors\n\nand the responses from the WellMess backdoor. The data is stored\n\non disk until the intended receiver connects and requests it. The\n\n[technique has some similarity with a previous malware used by APT29](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=6ab66701-25d7-4685-ae9d-93d63708a11c&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\n\ncalled Seaduke.\n\n##### Holy Water/Storm Cloud APT - Target Tibetan Individuals\n\nIn March 2020, both [Kaspersky Labs and](https://securelist.com/holy-water-ongoing-targeted-water-holing-attack-in-asia/96311/) [Volexity reported on](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2020/03/31/storm-cloud-unleashed-tibetan-community-focus-of-highly-targeted-fake-flash-campaign/)\n\na new threat actor, named Holy Water and Storm Cloud by the\n\nvendors, targeting Tibetan individuals via watering hole attacks. The\n\ncompromised website was serving a drive-by download of a fake\n\nAdobe Flash update to highly selective visitors of the website. As\n\npart of the investigations of the group’s toolset, two new malware\n\nwritten in Go were uncovered. The first malware is named intelsync\n\nand operates as a stager. It obtains persistence and downloads the\n\nother Go malware named Godlike12. Godlike12 is a backdoor and has\n\na unique C2 communications channel. It’s controlled via Google Drive.\n\n[The malware interacts with Google Drive via an open-source library.](https://github.com/gdrive-org/gdrive)\n\nCommands are added to a drive folder as a file that the malware\n\ndownloads. The commands from the operator and responses from\n\nthe backdoor are transmitted as encrypted files that are shared via\n\nGoogle Drive.\n\n##### Mustang Panda - Go Loader\n\nIn November 2020, [Proofpoint released a report on the observed](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta416-goes-ground-and-returns-golang-plugx-malware-loader)\n\nactivity of Mustang Panda where a new loader written in Go was used\n\nto load PlugX. The loader was delivered as part of a self-extracting\n\nRAR archive. The archive also included a legitimate application from\n\nAdobe. The legitimate application is vulnerable to DLL side-loading\n\nand Mustang Panda uses this vulnerability to side-load the loader.\n\nThis is a well-known technique that threat actors have used well in the\n\npast. The archive also includes another file with its content encrypted.\n\n\nThe loader decrypts the file and executes it from memory. The\n\ndecrypted payload is a version of PlugX, a malware commonly used\n\nby Mustang Panda.\n\nThe loader is relatively small and consists of less than 250 lines of\n\ncode. The CEFProcessForkHandlerEx function in the snippet below is\n\nexported and called by the legitimate application as part of the DLL\n\nside-loading attack.\n\n#### Non-Nation State-Backed Threat Actors\n\n##### Loaders/Crypters\n\nThe binaries produced by the Go compiler are relatively large when\n\ncompared to binaries produced by other languages. For example, a\n\n_Hello World binary has over 1700 functions. With so much common_\n\ncode in the binary, it can be like finding a needle in a haystack when\n\nlooking for suspicious code. This may be one of the reasons why\n\nmalicious Go binaries sometimes aren't detected by Antivirus engines.\n\nThis has led to some threat actors developing crypters in Go and using\n\n[them to deliver other older and well-detected malware. This technique](https://sysopfb.github.io/malware/2020/02/28/Golang-Wrapper-on-an-old-malware.html)\n\ncan reduce the detection and even sometimes make the malware fully\n\nundetected. Embedding other binaries within a Go binary is relatively\n\neasy. There are plenty of open-source libraries that have solved this\n\nproblem. Below is a list of some of them.\n\n- [https://github.com/gobuffalo/packr](https://github.com/gobuffalo/packr)\n\n- [https://github.com/rakyll/statik](https://github.com/rakyll/statik)\n\n- [https://github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice](https://github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice)\n\n- [https://github.com/UnnoTed/fileb0x](https://github.com/UnnoTed/fileb0x)\n\n- [https://github.com/mjibson/esc](https://github.com/mjibson/esc)\n\n- [https://github.com/kevinburke/go-bindata](https://github.com/kevinburke/go-bindata)\n\n- [https://github.com/lu4p/binclude](https://github.com/lu4p/binclude)\n\n- [https://github.com/omeid/go-resources](https://github.com/omeid/go-resources)\n\n- [https://github.com/pyros2097/go-embed](https://github.com/pyros2097/go-embed)\n\n- [https://github.com/wlbr/mule](https://github.com/wlbr/mule)\n\n- [https://github.com/miscing/embed](https://github.com/miscing/embed)\n\n- [https://github.com/kyioptr/gassets](https://github.com/kyioptr/gassets)\n\nMost of these have been designed to allow the embedding of static\n\nassets for web services but the use case isn't limited to this. The\n\nfunctionality of embedding files has been so well regarded that earlier\n\nthis year a proposal was suggested to add the functionality directly\n\nto the Go compiler. The [proposal has been accepted and should be](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/draft-embed.md)\n\nreleased with version 1.16 that is scheduled for release in February\n\n2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn October 2020, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 released a [report on](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/black-t-cryptojacking-variant/)\n\nsome updates to the threat actor [TeamTNT. One of the samples](https://www.intezer.com/blog/cloud-workload-protection/attackers-abusing-legitimate-cloud-monitoring-tools-to-conduct-cyber-attacks/)\n\nin the report has been encrypted with an open-source tool called\n\n[Ezuri. Ezuri encrypts the original binary with AES and appends it to](https://github.com/guitmz/ezuri)\n\nthe end of a stub file. The stub has two functions in addition to the\n\nmain function as can be seen in the code snippet. When executed, it\n\ndecrypts the original memory and writes it to a memory-backed file\n\nthat is executed. This results in no artifacts being written to disk.\n\nAnother open-source loader is the [Go shellcode LoaDer. It also](https://github.com/EddieIvan01/gld)\n\nencrypts the payload with AES. It decrypts the payload and uses\n\n_ZwProtectVirtualMemory to mark the decrypted buffer as Read/Execute_\n\nbefore it is executed. Malware samples that are using this loader have\n\n[been observed in the wild. For example, CobaltStrike beacons.](https://analyze.intezer.com/files/22832a2a1e82f18d74622fd93d3e527f21377a41d3e2bb307d1b5b3f2a29c73d)\n\nWe have also observed threat actors writing their own crypters and\n\nloaders. For example, we have seen a loader called _gocrypter used_\n\nto encrypt commodity malware; mostly RATs and keyloggers. The\n\nstub, shown in the code snippet below, is less than 100 lines of code.\n\nThe payload has been encrypted with AES and is stored as a base64\n\nencoded blob inside the binary. The crypter decodes it into bytes and\n\ndecrypts it before it is written to disk and executed.\n\nFollowing is a list of a few gocrypter samples with different malware\n\nas the payload.\n\n######

RATs\n\nGo has a very well-written networking stack that is easy to to work\n\nwith. Go has become one of the programming languages for the cloud\n\nwith many cloud-native applications written in it. For example, Docker,\n\nKubernetes, InfluxDB, Traefik, Terraform, CockroachDB, Prometheus\n\nand Consul are all written in Go. This makes sense given that one of\n\nthe reasons behind the creation of Go was to invent a better language\n\nthat could be used to replace the internal C++ network services used\n\nby Google. That Remote Access Trojans (RATs) have been written in\n\nGo is not much of a surprise. After all, they very much function as\n\nnetwork services.\n\nThroughout the year, both new RATs emerged and old ones kept\n\n[being used. Back in August 2020, we discovered a Linux version of a](https://twitter.com/IntezerLabs/status/1291355808811409408)\n\nbackdoor used by the Carbanak threat actor. The sample was compiled\n\nusing version 1.8 of the compiler that was released in February 2017.\n\nThe same compiler version and build environment were used for the\n\n[initial Windows sample that was part of the RSA report in 2017. It is](https://www.rsa.com/content/dam/en/white-paper/the-carbanak-fin7-syndicate.pdf)\n\nlikely the Linux version was also used during that time frame when\n\nsomeone finally uploaded a sample to VirusTotal.\n\nGlupteba is a malware that has been around since 2011 but in\n\nSeptember of 2019, a [new version rewritten in Go was discovered.](https://twitter.com/James_inthe_box/status/1171831864945827840)\n\nThroughout 2020, more of this new version has been seen in the wild.\n\nThe malware tries to install a root-kit when it infects a machine. To\n\nby-pass protections in Windows that prevent installing kernel drivers,\n\nthe malware [exploits a vulnerable VirtualBox driver. The malware](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/glupteba_final.pdf)\n\ninstalls the driver, which Windows will allow since it is signed, and uses\n\nit to execute code in Ring-0 to disable Kernel Patch Protection (KPP).\n\nThis technique is not new, it was first used by the APT group Turla. In\n\naddition to this, the malware tries to spread within the local network\n\nby exploiting EternalBlue.\n\nWindows is not the only operating system that has been targeted with\n\n[RATs written in Go. In October 2020, Bitdefender released a discovery](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2020/10/theres-a-new-a-golang-written-rat-in-town/)\n\nof a new RAT that targets Linux. Bitdefender's researchers believe it\n\nmight be related to _PowerGhost activity from 2019. The threat actor_\n\ntargets WebLogic servers that are vulnerable to CVE-2019-2725. The\n\nRAT appears to be named NiuB by the author. The malware consists of\n\ntwo binaries, the main malware, and a guard malware. The structure of\n\nthe main malware is shown in the code snippet below.\n\n\nThe malware collects information about the infected machine and\n\nsends it to the C2 server. It can execute shell commands and download\n\nand execute other binaries.\n\nThe _guard part downloads and installs the malware. It ensures that_\n\nthe RAT is running. The snippet below shows the function names for\n\nthe guard binary.\n\nIn January 2020, FireEye released a [report on attacks targeting](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/01/vigilante-deploying-mitigation-for-citrix-netscaler-vulnerability-while-maintaining-backdoor.html)\n\nNetScaler devices. The attacks were exploiting the CVE-2019-19781\n\nvulnerability. As part of the attack, the threat actor used a new\n\nmalware that had not been seen before. FireEye named the malware\n\n_NOTROBIN. As can be seen in the code snippet, NOTROBIN has a few_\n\nfunctionalities.\n\nIt was written in Go and compiled to run on *BSD, the underlying\n\noperating system used by NetScaler. One interesting functionality\n\nis that the malware blocks other malware from exploiting the same\n\nvulnerability by scanning for new NetScaler template files that may\n\nhave been added as part of an exploit attempt and removes them. It\n\nopens a UDP listener on port 18634 but ignores the data sent to it. It\n\nessentially acts as a mutex to ensure only one copy of the malware is\n\nrunning on the infected machine.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Stealers\n\nThere have been a few _stealers that have been written in Go. In 2019, Malwarebytes reported on a stealer called_\n\n[CryptoStealer.Go. It is designed to steal cryptocurrency wallets and data stored in browsers, such as credit card](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2019/01/analyzing-new-stealer-written-golang/)\n\ninformation. The function names have been obfuscated, as can be seen in the snippet below. Throughout 2020 threat\n\nactors have continued to use this stealer.\n\nAlso during 2020, a clipboard stealer written in Go [was found. It appears to have been active since 2019. Based on](https://analyze.intezer.com/files/bd978ba0d723aea3106c6abc58cf71df5abe4d674d0d1fc38b37d4926d740738)\n\nfilenames for samples uploaded to VirusTotal, the stealer is masquerading as hacking tools, suggesting it is used to target\n\nother threat actors.\n\nThe malware has a simple design. The extracted function names are shown in the snippet below. It installs itself under\n\n**AppData\\Local\\Support and hides the file or the folder. It reads the clipboard and checks if it looks like a cryptocurrency**\n\naddress. If it does, the malware replaces the clipboard content with the threat actor’s Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, or\n\nEthereum wallet.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Bitcoin wallet address in the malware has been active since the Fall of 2018. As can be seen in Figure 2 below, it has\n\nreceived 534 transactions with the value of almost 11 BTC as of this writing.\n\n###### Figure 2: Summary of the Bitcoin wallet used by the clipboard stealer.\n\n#### Ransomware\n\nGo's standard library provides a very robust set of crypto-libraries that allows developers to incorporate encryption in their\n\napplications without the need for using any third-party libraries. This, with the combination of the current increase in ransomware\n\nactivity, is not a surprise that malware authors have started to use Go to write ransomware. During 2020 we saw both old and\n\nnew ransomware families being used.\n\nOne of the ransomware that still had some activity in 2020 is RobbinHood. RobbinHood was discovered in the Spring of 2019 and\n\n[got a lot of media attention when it was revealed the city of Baltimore had been attacked by the ransomware. Sophos released](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/05/baltimore-city-government-hit-by-robbinhood-ransomware/)\n\na report in February detailing some evolution by the threat actor. By exploiting a vulnerable driver from Gigabyte, the threat\n\nactor started to load an unsigned driver. Once the driver was loaded, it would kill processes to endpoint and tamper protection\n\nsoftware to ensure the ransomware could encrypt the rest of the hard drive without being interrupted. Still, in November\n\n2020, new samples were being found in the wild. As can be seen in Figure 3, the ransom note has not changed. A sample from\n\nNovember had the PDB string of C:/Users/User/go/src/Robbinhood7, suggesting it might be the 7th version of the ransomware\n\naccording to the malware author.\n\n###### Figure 3: RobbinHood's ransom note used in November 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother older ransomware written in Go and still active is _Snatch._\n\n[Snatch was discovered in December of 2018 and to this day appears](https://id-ransomware.blogspot.com/2018/12/snatch-ransomware.html)\n\nto still be used. The ransomware is used by Snatch Team and they\n\ntarget enterprise environments via remotely accessible services, [for](https://thedfirreport.com/2020/06/21/snatch-ransomware/)\n\n[example, RDP. Once inside the network, the group tries to deploy the](https://thedfirreport.com/2020/06/21/snatch-ransomware/)\n\nransomware on all the machines and encrypt the files. The ransomware\n\nhas an interesting technique when encrypting the files that was\n\nintroduced to the ransomware in October of 2019. The ransomware\n\n[installs itself as a service that can be started even if Windows boots](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2019/12/09/snatch-ransomware-reboots-pcs-into-safe-mode-to-bypass-protection/)\n\ninto Safe Mode. Following this, the ransomware reboots Windows into\n\nSafe Mode allowing it to encrypt all the files on the hard drive without\n\nbeing blocked by any potential endpoint protection software installed.\n\nGiven this functionality, the malware is relatively simple in design. A\n\ngenerated source code structure is shown below in the snippet.\n\n_Nefilim is a ransomware that first emerged in_ [March of 2020. It is](https://id-ransomware.blogspot.com/2020/03/nefilim-ransomware.html)\n\nthe predecessor of another ransomware called Nemty. The original\n\nversion was written in C++ but in July the malware [was rewritten in](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1281677718376120328)\n\nGo. In addition to encrypting the files on the victim's machine, the\n\nthreat actors behind _Nefilim also steal the victim's data and use it_\n\nfor extortion. The group operates a leak site called Corporate Leaks,\n\nFigure 4.\n\n\n###### Figure 4: Screenshot of Nefilim's leak site.\n\nAccording to their leak site, the threat group has at least compromised\n\nover 20 different entities and leaked some of their data. One of the\n\nbiggest companies that has been compromised by this group is\n\nWhirlpool and their data started to become public in [December of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/home-appliance-giant-whirlpool-hit-in-nefilim-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[2020.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/home-appliance-giant-whirlpool-hit-in-nefilim-ransomware-attack/)\n\nAnother ransomware that emerged in 2020 from a lineage of other\n\nransomware is SatanCryptor. It first appeared in [January 2020.](https://www.carbonblack.com/blog/threat-analysis-unit-tau-threat-intelligence-notification-satancryptor-ransomware/)\n\nAccording to security researcher [Andrew Ivanov, the ransomware](https://twitter.com/@Amigo_A_)\n\nhas its [lineage from](https://id-ransomware.blogspot.com/2020/01/satancryptor-go-ransomware.html) _Satan Cryptor 2.0 that first appeared in 2017._\n\nOne interesting aspect with regards to the ransomware is that as it\n\nis encrypting the disk, it’s providing feedback to the threat actor via\n\na Telegram bot.\n\n_EKANS or also known as Snake ransomware is a malware that was first_\n\nreported publicly in [January 2020. It is a ransomware that is being](https://labs.sentinelone.com/new-snake-ransomware-adds-itself-to-the-increasing-collection-of-golang-crimeware/)\n\nused in highly targeted attacks against high-value targets. The first\n\nassumed victim reported in the public was The _Bahrain Petroleum_\n\n_Company (BAPCO). The connection was made based on the email_\n\naddress left in the ransom note by the malware. At around the same\n\ntime frame, BAPCO [experienced a compromise where a new wiper](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/news/2020/01/10/bapco-dustman/)\n\nnamed _Dustman was used. Dustman is an updated version of the_\n\nmalware _ZeroCleare that shares some similarities with_ _Shamoon, a_\n\n\"cyber weapon\" used by an Iranian threat actor. It is unclear if there\n\nis a link between the EKANS sample discovered and the Dustman\n\ncompromise. The ransomware includes a list of processes that it\n\ntries to kill before it encrypts the files on the disks. The list includes\n\nsome processes that are used in Industrial Control Systems (ICS). This\n\nis not unique to EKANS and it appears that [the list has a significant](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-and-ics-operations/)\n\n[overlap with another ransomware's kill list, the ransomware is known](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-and-ics-operations/)\n\nas MegaCortex.\n\nOn May 4th, the ID Ransomware [saw a spike in EKANS samples](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/large-scale-snake-ransomware-campaign-targets-healthcare-more/)\n\nsubmitted. This was later correlated to a ransomware attack that\n\naffected _Fresenius Group, a hospital provider in Europe._ [According](https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/pdf/5045-ccn-cert-id-15-20-snake-locker-english-1/file.html)\n\n[to CCN-CERT the malware tries to resolve the domain name](https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/pdf/5045-ccn-cert-id-15-20-snake-locker-english-1/file.html) **ADS.**\n\n**FRESENIUS.COM** and compares the returned IP address to a known\n\nprivate IP address. If the returned IP address doesn't match what\n\nthe malware expects it to be, it doesn't perform anything malicious.\n\nEssentially, limiting the damage to the Fresenius environment only.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The method has been used by later versions of the ransomware to limit the spread of the malware. In June 2020, two](https://twitter.com/milkr3am/status/1270019326976786432)\n\nnew samples were uploaded to VirusTotal that both resolved two different internal domains. One tried to resolve MDS.\n\n**[HONDA.COM while the other tried to resolve ENELINT.GLOBAL. A day later, Honda released a statement on Twitter that](https://twitter.com/HondaCustSvc/status/1270048801307234304)**\n\n\"Honda Customer Service and Honda Financial Services are experiencing technical difficulties and are unavailable.\" Edesur\n\nArgentina, which is part of Enel Argentina, also released a similar statement. Not many attacks with EKANS have been\n\nreported in the public so it appears that the threat actor behind the ransomware is very selective and only uses it or\n\ntargets high-value entities.\n\nOn October 19th, 2020, Malwarebytes discovered a phishing attack targeting staff at the University of British Columbia.\n\nThe phishing campaign was used to deliver a new ransomware not seen before called Vaggen. The ransomware's function\n\nnames are named in Swedish, as can be seen in the code snippet below. The files are encrypted with a static key that is\n\n“du_tar_mitt_hjart_mina_pengarna0”. Translated from: \"You take my heart my money\". The ransomware asked for a low\n\nfee of 80 USD in Bitcoin to decrypt the files.\n\nUsing code reuse analysis, see Figure 5, other malware written by the same author were found. In addition to using\n\nSwedish words for function names, they also reference op-lucifer in the PDB path as can be seen in the code snippet\n\nbelow.\n\n###### Figure 5: Code reuse analysis between Vaggen ransomware and another malware written by the same threat actor.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the malware written by the threat actor appears to be a DNS\n\nreflection tool. The function names are shown in the code snippet\n\nbelow.\n\nSince Go provides a simple way of cross-compiling binaries for\n\ndifferent architectures and operating systems, it is not a surprise that\n\nit is being used for RaaS ransomware. It allows the threat actor to use\n\na single code base and produce binaries targeting different operating\n\nsystems with a very low effort. Go has already been used in RaaS, as\n\ndescribed earlier with Shifr. During the Spring of 2020, a new RaaS was\n\nannounced called [Smaug. Smaug is a relatively simple ransomware](https://www.anomali.com/blog/anomali-threat-research-releases-first-public-analysis-of-smaug-ransomware-as-a-service)\n\nbut it provides \"users'' of the service ransomware for Windows, Linux,\n\nand macOS. It can operate in an \"enterprise\" mode where one key is\n\nused for all machines or one key per machine mode. For the trouble,\n\nthe operator of the RaaS takes a 20% cut.\n\nThat Go can produce binaries for other operating systems and\n\narchitectures allows threat actors to easily target different types of\n\ndevices, for example, embedded systems as such. In the Summer of\n\n[2019, we discovered QNAPCrypt, which is also known as eCh0raix, a](https://www.intezer.com/blog/linux/seizing-15-active-ransomware-campaigns-targeting-linux-file-storage-servers/)\n\nransomware that targeted QNAP NAS devices. It was later also used\n\n[to target Synology NAS devices. In 2020, a new ransomware targeting](https://www.qnap.com/en-uk/security-advisory/qsa-20-06)\n\n[QNAP devices was discovered.

The addition that the binary includes everything it needs\n\nto run properly provides the authors of the code more reassurance\n\nthat it will run on for example different Linux distributions. It doesn't\n\nhave to worry that a library is already installed on the machine or not.\n\nBecause what it needs, it brings with it. There are also plenty of third\nparty libraries that provide the functionality to access other services.\n\nFor example here is a list of some bot libraries that can be used to\n\ndevelop bots for different services.\n\n- [https://github.com/go-joe/joe](https://github.com/go-joe/joe)\n\n- [https://github.com/bot-api/telegram](https://github.com/bot-api/telegram)\n\n- [https://github.com/shomali11/slacker](https://github.com/shomali11/slacker)\n\n- [https://github.com/go-chat-bot/bot](https://github.com/go-chat-bot/bot)\n\n- [https://github.com/frodsan/fbot](https://github.com/frodsan/fbot)\n\n- [https://github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api)\n\n- [https://github.com/tucnak/telebot](https://github.com/tucnak/telebot)\n\n\n-----\n\n[With open-source bot libraries available, it is not uncommon for them to be misused by malware authors. One example](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2020/06/ssh-targeting-golang-bots-becoming-the-new-norm/)\n\n[is IRCFlu. IRCFlu is an IRC bot that is hosted on GitHub. Figure 6 shows the project listing on GitHub. The library provides](https://github.com/muesli/ircflu)\n\nfunctionality to execute arbitrary code on the machine hosting the bot, which allows threat actors to use this bot to remote\n\ncontrol multiple infected machines.\n\n###### Figure 6: Screenshot of IRCFlu’s source code repository hosted on GitHub.\n\nIn addition to open-source projects being misused, 2020 also saw the continuation of attacks from old and well-known bot\n\nnetworks. The botnet known as ddg was first reported on by Netlab at 360. They detected attacks against servers hosting\n\nOrientDB in [October 2017 from the botnet. The goal for the botnet was to install Monero miners. In 2020, the botnet](https://blog.netlab.360.com/ddg-a-mining-botnet-aiming-at-database-server-en/)\n\n[was updated to be more resilient against take-downs by adding a p2p network backed C2 infrastructure. The hybrid p2p](https://blog.netlab.360.com/ddg-upgrade-to-new-p2p-hybrid-model/)\n\nnetwork infrastructure allows the threat actor to maintain control over the bots if the normal C2 servers go down. In April\n\nof 2020, the botnet had about 20,000 bots with the majority of them being located in China.\n\nAnother older botnet that still is active is _StealthWorker, also known as_ _GoBrut. StealthWorker was first reported on by_\n\n[Malwarebytes in February 2019. It is a bot that is sold on dark web forums under the name of](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2019/02/new-golang-brute-forcer-discovered-amid-rise-e-commerce-attacks/) _Stealth Bomber and is_\n\nused to gain access to network services via credential brute force attacks. By analyzing the function names, shown in the\n\ncode snippet below, we can see the services the bot has support for. The list includes web services such as Drupal and\n\nWordPress but also the e-commerce platforms Magento and OpenCart that if the threat actor gains access can be used\n\nto launch Magecart style attacks.\n\n[The botnet r2r2 is another bot spreading via brute-forcing credentials. It was first discovered back in 2018. It randomly](https://www.guardicore.com/2018/06/operation-prowli-traffic-manipulation-cryptocurrency-mining-2/)\n\ngenerates IP addresses and tries to gain access to services running SSH with weak credentials. Once it has gained a\n\nfoothold, it installs a cryptominer on the machine. The bot has very limited functionality, it consists of less than 200\n\nhundred lines of code as can be seen in the code snippet below. The malware has not changed much since 2019, Figure\n\n7 shows similarities between a sample found in the wild in 2020 to samples indexed in 2019. The code overlap is 100%.\n\n\n###### Figure 6: Screenshot of IRCFlu’s source code repository hosted on GitHub.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 7: Similarity between 2020 and 2019 samples of r2r2 bot. The similarity shows a 100% match.\n\n[Other botnets have evolved to increase their potential targeting. In 2020 the Orthrus, also known as Golang, evolved to](https://lekstu.ga/posts/go-under-the-hood-orthrus/)\n\n[also target Windows servers. The bot was first reported on by Antiy in June 2019. It has mainly targeted Redis servers that](https://www.antiy.cn/research/notice&report/research_report/20190625.html)\n\nare either unprotected or have weak credentials. Once it gains remote code execution, it installs a set of binaries. One is\n\na scanner for other vulnerable services, a watchdog service, and a cryptominer. The scanner tries to compromise other\n\nnetwork services with known vulnerabilities. For example, Weblogic, Elasticsearch, and Drupal are targeted. In 2020, the\n\nmalware also added targeting against Microsoft SQL Servers. It tries to gain access via brute-forcing the credentials. The\n\n[malware includes a list of nearly 3000 passwords that it only uses against SQL servers. In December we uncovered another](https://www.intezer.com/blog/research/new-golang-worm-drops-xmrig-miner-on-servers/)\n\ncross-operating system mining bot that we call XMRig Miner Dropper. It targets servers running MySQL Tomcat and Jenkins\n\nwith weak credentials, or vulnerable WebLogic. Depending on the underlying operating system, the bot delivers either a\n\npayload for executing a shell script or a PowerShell script. Once it has compromised the machine, it installs a cryptominer\n\nand tries to exploit other servers.\n\n[In September 2016 the source code for Mirai was released. This has resulted in many new botnets derived from the Mirai](https://github.com/jgamblin/Mirai-Source-Code/blob/master/ForumPost.md)\n\nsource code. While the bot code was written in C++, the release of the code has served as a blueprint for other malware\n\n[authors to write similar bots in different languages. In January 2020, Bitdefender released a report on a new Mirai-inspired](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2020/01/hold-my-beer-mirai-spinoff-named-liquorbot-incorporates-cryptomining/)\n\nbotnet written in Go that they named LiquorBot. The botnet is essentially a reimplementation of Mirai in Go and targets\n\nLinux devices running on ARM (both 32 and 64 bit), x86 (32 and 64 bit), and MIPS. As can be seen in the code snippet below,\n\nthe bot spreads by brute-forcing SSH credentials and by exploiting known vulnerabilities in routers. Once it has gained\n\naccess to a device, it tries to infect others and also installs a Monero cryptominer.\n\n\n-----\n\n[LiquorBot is not the only Mirai-inspired botnet. In April we identified](https://www.intezer.com/blog/research/kaiji-new-chinese-linux-malware-turning-to-golang/)\n\nKaiji, a botnet targeting Linux servers and IoT devices via SSH brute\nforcing. In addition to brute-forcing weak credentials, the bot also tries\n\nto use local SSH keys found on the infected machine to spread to other\n\nmachines within the enterprise. In a similar vein as Mirai, Kaiji allows\n\nthe botmaster to launch DDoS attacks against any infrastructure of\n\ntheir choosing. The attacks include two TCPFlood implementations\n\n(one with raw sockets), two UDPFlood implementations (one with raw\n\nsockets), IPSpoof attack, SYNACK attack, SYN attack, and ACK attack.\n\nThe malware has, as can be seen in the code snippet below, some\n\nfunction names that are Latin letter representations of Chinese words\n\nwhich suggests the malware is written by a Chinese speaker.\n\n\n[In June 2020, Kaiji expanded its targeting method to include servers](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/f/xorddos-kaiji-botnet-malware-variants-target-exposed-docker-servers.html)\n\nwith exposed API sockets. The malware started to scan the internet for\n\nhosts with port 2375 exposed. If it found one it would try to deploy a\n\nrogue Docker container and execute Kaiji in the container.\n\nKaiji is not the only botnet that has been targeting exposed Docker\n\nAPIs. In November 2020, [NetLab 360 reported a discovery of a new](https://blog.netlab.360.com/blackrota-an-obfuscated-backdoor-written-in-go-en/)\n\nmalware called Blackrota. Kinsing, also known as h2Miner, has been\n\nknown to target Docker APIs. Kinsing was first reported on by the\n\n[researchers at Alibaba Cloud in January 2020. The botnet was using](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/new-outbreak-of-h2miner-worms-exploiting-redis-rce-detected_595743)\n\n_masscan to find machines exposing Hadoop Yarn, Redis, and Docker._\n\nWhen it found a server running any of these services, it would try to\n\nexploit known vulnerabilities in the services to spread itself further.\n\n[In May, we observed Kinsing exploiting CVE-2020-11651 and CVE-2020-](https://www.intezer.com/blog/cloud-security/exploitation-of-saltstack-vulnerabilities-signals-increase-in-cloud-server-attacks/)\n\n_11652, two vulnerabilities in_ _SaltStack, to spread. The malware also_\n\n[started to use an LD-PRELOAD userland rootkit to hide its process.](https://twitter.com/IntezerLabs/status/1259818964848386048)\n\nSSH brute-force has become one of the staple attacks employed by\n\nbotnets written in Go. We found a new Linux variant of IPStorm that\n\nincluded this attack vector. IPStorm is a peer-to-peer (p2p) botnet that\n\n[was first discovered in May 2019. It uses the open-source project IPFS](https://www.anomali.com/blog/the-interplanetary-storm-new-malware-in-wild-using-interplanetary-file-systems-ipfs-p2p-network)\n\nas its network backbone. In addition to original Windows variants,\n\nwe also found as part of the Linux variant, variants targeting Android\n\nand IoT devices. Unlike other botnets in this report, IPStorm's goal is\n\nnot to install a miner. Instead, the botnet appears to provide a proxy\n\n[network. This proxy network is sold as an anonymous proxy network](https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/376/Bitdefender-Whitepaper-IPStorm.pdf)\n\non the internet.\n\nIPStorm is not the only Go written p2p network that was active in 2020.\n\n[In August 2020, Guardicore released a report on a new p2p botnet they](https://www.guardicore.com/2020/08/fritzfrog-p2p-botnet-infects-ssh-servers/)\n\nhad been tracking since January the same year. The botnet was named\n\n_FritzFrog and infected machines by brute-forcing weak credentials._\n\nAccording to Guardicore, the botnet has successfully breached over\n\n500 servers that included \"known high-education institutions in the\n\nU.S. and Europe, and a railway company\". The malware does not\n\ninclude a persistent mechanism to survive reboots of machines; the\n\nbinary is deleted by itself after it has been executed. Instead, the\n\nbotnet employs persistence via reinfection. A public SSH key is added\n\nto the _authorized keys for the machine, allowing the threat actor to_\n\ngain access to the machine via SSH and reinfect it.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Future Predictions\n\nWhile the amount of malware written in Go is relatively small compared\n\nto malware written in other languages, the increase on a year-over\nyear basis is significant. This rate of increase is very likely to continue,\n\nmeaning malware written in Go will become much more frequent. For\n\nmalware targeting Linux environments, the fraction written in Go is\n\ngreater than for malware targeting Windows. This will likely lead to,\n\nbased on total malware targeting the specific system, the fraction of\n\nmalware targeting Linux systems will likely become greatest.\n\nA big part of the current Linux malware written in Go are bots that\n\neither are used for DDoS or installing cryptominers. This trend is\n\nlikely to continue. Other types may also become more frequent. We\n\nhave already seen Go ransomware targeting Linux systems and it is\n\npossible that more will emerge with the goal of stealing and encrypting\n\nvaluable data.\n\nThis aligns with [Proofpoint's prediction for 2021 that ransomware](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/security-briefs/seven-2021-security-predictions-and-trends-watch)\n\nthreat actors will start to focus more on attacking the cloud. This means\n\ncompanies should adopt cloud-focused detection and prevention\n\n[products, such as Intezer Protect, to ensure their cloud environments](http://www.intezer.com/intezer-protect)\n\nare protected. Many traditional Antivirus and endpoint protection\n\nsolutions have been designed to protect Windows environments while\n\nLinux environments have become more of a \"second class citizen\".\n\n[According to CrowdStrike's report on incidents from 2020, in 40% of](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/cyber-front-lines/)\n\nall incidents, the malware was not detected by Antivirus products.\n\nIn addition to this, Go malware has been hard to detect by Antivirus\n\nproducts so it’s likely this trend will continue. We have seen threat\n\nactors pivot and target different operating systems with the same\n\ncode base for the malware, resulting in low or undetected malware\n\nsamples. Since the malware is derived from the same codebase,\n\ndetection methods that use code genes are very effective. It’s likely\n\nwe will see more malware targeting multiple operating systems in the\n\nfuture since programming languages like Go provide an easy way for\n\nmalware authors to cross-compile their malware.\n\nOn the Windows side, many threat actors have used Go for\n\nransomware. It is likely this trend will continue in the future. With\n\nthe emergence of more RaaS offerings, it’s not unlikely that the\n\nransomware will be written in Go. With the ability to easily cross\ncompile, the RaaS operators can offer broader targeting to their\n\n\"customers\".\n\nAs we have seen an increase of non-nation state-backed threat\n\nactors adopting Go into their tooling, we will also start to see more\n\nnation state-backed threat actors do the same. This adoption will first\n\nbe focused on the Windows side with the rise of new loaders and\n\nRATs. Once the tooling has become well established in the Windows\n\nenvironment, it will be used in Linux environments too.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nGo is an open-source programming language that was developed\n\ninside Google to take advantage of advancements done in hardware\n\nover the last few decades. It is designed to make it easy for developers\n\nto produce fast, safe, network-focused code that takes advancement\n\non today's multicore CPUs. This has resulted in a great adoption of\n\nthe language, especially in the cloud environment. Developers are not\n\nthe only ones that have adopted Go. In the last few years, almost an\n\nincrease of 2000% of new malware written in Go has been found in\n\nthe wild. Many of these malware are botnets targeting Linux and IoT\n\ndevices to either install crypto miners or enroll the infected machine\n\ninto DDoS botnets. Also, ransomware has been written in Go and\n\nappears to become more common.\n\n\nSome notable ransomware written in Go is _Nefilim,_ _EKANS, and_\n\n_RobbinHood, ransomware used in what's called_ _big game hunting_\n\nattacks.\n\nIt is not just non-nation state-backed threat actors that have adopted\n\nGo, nation state-backed threat actors have too. In 2020 we saw a\n\nreturn of the Go variant of Zebrocy that was used against targeted\n\nattacks against foreign affairs-focused entities in Eastern Europe. The\n\nUK's NCSC attributed attacks against entities working on the COVID-19\n\nvaccine to APT29, a Russian nation state-backed threat actor. As part\n\nof the report, they attributed the WellMess malware to the threat\n\nactor. WellMess has been around for a few years but had not before\n\nthis been attributed to a specific threat actor. Chinese nation state\nbacked threat actors also started to use Go malware as part of their\n\ntoolset. Malware written in Go was used against targeted attacks\n\nagainst Tibetan individuals and we also saw Mustang Panda introduce\n\na new loader written in Go that was used to execute PlugX.\n\nWith more adoption of Go in toolsets for both non-nation state-backed\n\nand nation-state-backed threat actors seen in 2020, it is likely this\n\ntrend will continue in the future. Traditional Antivirus solutions still\n\nappear to struggle detecting malware written in Go. Newer techniques\n\nthat not only determine maliciousness based on code reuse but also\n\nclassify the threat have seen greater success as they can handle\n\nsimilarities even between Linux and Windows binaries. While malware\n\nwritten in Go may still be in its infancy, it may soon reach adolescence\n\nresulting in a considerable increase.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix A ### Go Reverse Engineering Toolkit\n\n\nThe _[redress software is a tool for analyzing stripped Go binaries](https://go-re.tk/redress/)_\n\ncompiled with the Go compiler. It extracts data from the binary and\n\nuses it to reconstruct symbols that can be used to perform analysis.\n\nIt essentially tries to “dress” a “stripped” binary. It is open-source and\n\n[can be downloaded from its GitHub page.](https://github.com/goretk/redress)\n\nBinaries compiled with the Go compiler include a large set of\n\nmetadata. This metadata can be used to assist static analysis of\n\nstripped binaries. Stripped binaries, especially statically compiled,\n\nare hard to analyze. Since the symbols have been removed and the\n\nhuge number of subroutines—hello world binary in Go has thousands\n\nof subroutines—it can be very time-consuming. Fortunately, the\n\nmetadata in the binary can be used to reconstruct symbols and\n\nalso recover information about the source code layout. One of the\n\nelements that can be recovered is function information. [All this](https://lekstu.ga/posts/hello-moduledata/)\n\n[metadata can be found via the moduledata structure.](https://lekstu.ga/posts/hello-moduledata/)\n\nThe moduledata structure is a data table that was first introduced in\n\nversion 1.5 of Go. It is a structure that holds important information\n\nthat is needed when you statically analyze Go binaries. It records\n\ninformation about the layout of the executable. For ELF binaries,\n\nthe structure can be found in the “.noptrdata” section. In PE files it is\n\nmuch harder to find. Sometimes it is located in the “.text” section and\n\nsometimes in the “.data” section. If the binary has been stripped there\n\nis no symbol pointing to the structure. In these scenarios, a brute\nforce search is needed.\n\nThe first entry in the structure is the “pclntable”. This table holds\n\nmappings between source code line numbers and the program\n\ncounters. This table is used to produce meaningful stack traces\n\nduring a panic. The table is not removed if the binary is stripped and\n\nif debugging information is removed. Since it holds information that\n\nmaps back to the source code file, this table can be a gold mine for\n\nmalware analysts. The information includes the full file path, the\n\nname of the source file at compile time and name of the function. Also\n\nusing the program counter to source code line number mapping, it is\n\n[possible to estimate the source code lines of functions. Since this table](https://lekstu.ga/posts/pclntab-function-recovery/)\n\n[holds a lot of information, it is one of the big contributors to the large](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/go-file-size/)\n\nfile size of Go binaries, particularly in larger applications.\n\nThe current implementation version in Go was released with version\n\n[1.2. The proposal both outlines the original reason for the table and](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lyPIbmsYbXnpNj57a261hgOYVpNRcgydurVQIyZOz_o/pub)\n\nsome of the possible uses. The quote below states that it was added\n\nto enhance the stack traces.\n\nTo get accurate crash-time stack traces years ago, I moved the Plan 9\n\nsymbol and pc->line number (pcln) tables into memory that would be\n\nmapped at runtime, and then I put code to parse them in the runtime\n\npackage. In addition to stack traces, the stack walking ability is now\n\nused for profiling and garbage collection.\n\nIt also states that it can be used for mapping the program counter to\n\nsource code line number:\n\nThere are many interesting uses of pc-value tables. The most obvious is\n\nmapping program counter to line number.\n\nThis means, by parsing the table it should be possible to recover\n\nfunction information.\n\nThe proposal suggests that the standard library has code that can\n\n\nparse this table. Instead of implementing a parser from scratch, it is\n\nmuch easier to use something that is already written. Searching the\n\nstandard library source code for references to the _PCLNTAB results_\n\nin some matches found in the debug package. The debug package\n\nappears to be a good starting point.\n\nWith these tools, it is possible to reconstruct a theoretical source code\n\nlayout. By using the PCToLine function, it is possible to get the source\n\ncode line numbers the function was located between. Sorting this by\n\nfile and with some formatting it is possible to produce a tree structure\n\nas shown below. It can be seen in the example that the main function\n\nhas all its code located in the main.go file. This file was located in the\n\nfolder C:/!Project/C1/ProjectC1Dec during compile time. The output\n\nalso includes a file called <autogenerated>. This is for functions\n\ngenerated by the compiler. In this case, the coder did not use and\n\nimplement the init function so a dummy version was added by the\n\ncompiler.\n```\n$ shasum zebrocy && file zebrocy && redress -src
