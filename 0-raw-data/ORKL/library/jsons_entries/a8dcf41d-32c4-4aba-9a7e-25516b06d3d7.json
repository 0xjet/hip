The Windows [version has a VBscript-based implant as the final stage instead of a](https://archive.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002803.html)\n[C#/PowerShell combo as observed previously in Powersing samples. The VBS-based implant](https://securelist.com/deathstalker-mercenary-triumvirate/98177/)\nsamples we have identified to date have a range of version numbers, meaning it is still in\ndevelopment. Overall, Janicab shows the same functionalities as its counterpart malware families,\n\n\n-----\n\nbut instead of downloading several tools later in the intrusion lifecycle, as was the case with\nEVILNUM and Powersing intrusions, the analyzed samples have most of the tools embedded and\nobfuscated within the dropper.\n\nInterestingly, the threat actor continues to use YouTube, Google+, and WordPress web services as\nDDRs. However, some of the YouTube links observed are unlisted and go back to 2015, indicating\na possible infrastructure reuse.\n\nLaw firms and financial institutions continue to be most affected by Deathstalker. However, in the\nintrusions analyzed recently, we suspect that travel agencies are a new vertical that we haven’t\npreviously seen being targeted by this threat actor.\n\nMore information about Deathstalker is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting.\nContact us: [intelreports@kaspersky.com.](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## Initial foothold\n\nWe determined that the initial infection method using a LNK-based dropper inside a ZIP archive,\nremained similar to previous campaigns using EVILNUM, Powersing, and PowerPepper, but each\nseems to focus on different phishing themes, as if each malware family is operated by different\nteams and/or intended for different types of victims. In a sample Janicab case, the decoy is an\nindustrial corporate profile (hydraulics) matching the subject of a decoy used in previous\nPowerPepper intrusion. Based on our telemetry, the delivery mechanism remains spear-phishing.\n\n\n**MD5** **File name** **File**\n**size**\n\n\n**SID** **MAC address**\n\n\nF1B5675E1A60049C7CD\n\n823EBA93FE977\n\n\nCorporate Profile\nHydraulica.lnk\n\n\n7.1\nMB\n\n\nS-1-5-212529457200\n497512101696528657-1000\n\n\n00:50:56:c0:00:08\n/ VMWare\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_Decoy document in LNK file_**\n\nThe LNK dropper’s metadata resembles many Powersing and Janicab implants we reported or\npublicly analyzed. Namely, the SID, font family, font size, screen buffer and window size, run\nwindow, and MAC address are similar.\n\nDespite Janicab and Powersing resembling each other a lot in terms of execution flow and the use\nof VBE and VBS, their LNKs are structured somewhat differently. In addition, newer Janicab\nvariants have changed significantly in structure compared to older Janicab Windows variants from\n2015. The new Janicab variants also embed a CAB archive containing several Python files and\nother artifacts used later in the intrusion lifecycle. Below is a high-level comparison between\nPowersing and the new and old Janicab variants.\n\n**_Powersing_**\n\n**_Janicab 1.2.9a_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Janicab 1.1.2_**\n\n**_LNK files structure comparison_**\n\n## The execution flow\n\nOnce a victim is tricked into opening the malicious LNK file, a series of chained malware files are\ndropped. The LNK file has an embedded “Command Line Arguments” field that aims at extracting\nand executing an encoded VBScript loader (1.VBE). The latter will drop and execute another\nembedded and encoded VBScript (2.VBE) that will extract a CAB archive (cab.cab) containing\nadditional resources and Python libraries/tools, and conclude the infection by extracting the last\nstage – a VBScript-based implant known as Janicab. The final stage will initiate persistence by\ndeploying a new LNK file in the Startup directory and will start communicating with the DDR web\nservices to gather the actual C2 IP address.\n\n**Janicab (1.2.9a)**\n\n**MD5** 3f1e0540793d9b9dbd26d6fadceacb71\n\n**SHA1** aacd0752289f3b0c6be3fadba368a9a71e46a228\n\n**SHA256** 33f9780a2f0838e43457a8190616bec9e5489e1a112501e950fc40e0a3b2782e\n\n**File type** Encoded VBE script\n\n**File size** 593 KB\n\n**File name** %userprofile%.VBE\n\nJanicab is a VBS-based malware implant that is mostly similar in functionality to its counterpart\n[malware families, Powersing and EVILNUM. All have basic functionalities such as command](https://securelist.com/deathstalker-mercenary-triumvirate/98177/)\nexecution, importing registry files, and the ability to download additional tools while maintaining\n\n\n-----\n\npersistence with high anti-VM and defense evasion.\n\nSince all three malware families share strong similarities, we will only discuss the interesting\ndifferences between Janicab versions in this section.\n\nJanicab can be considered a modular, interpreted-language malware. Meaning the threat actor is\nable to add/remove functions or embedded files; interpreted-language malware provides such\n[flexibility with reasonably low effort. For example, in older variants, SnapIT.exe, a known tool used](http://processchecker.com/file/SnapIt.exe.html)\nto capture screenshots, was embedded, dropped and executed at intervals. This tool was replaced\nin later variants with other custom-built tools that do the same job. We’ve also seen audio recording\ncapabilities in older variants, but not in later variants.\n\nIn newer variants, we started seeing the threat actor embed a DLL-based keylogger or screen\ncapture utility that is invoked using the ‘run_dll_or_py’ function. Interestingly, according to our\nKaspersky Threat Attribution Engine (KTAE), the keylogger is very similar to another keylogger\nused in previous Powersing intrusions we reported and came under the name ‘AdobeUpdater.dll’.\nIn Powersing intrusions, the DLL was fetched later in the intrusion cycle from a secondary C2\nserver. However, in Janicab intrusions, it was mostly embedded as a HEX bytes array, or inside\nCAB files as extra resources. We’re aware of eight different Janicab versions: 1.0.8, 1.1.2, 1.1.4,\n1.2.5, 1.2.7, 1.2.8, 1.2.9a, 1.3.2.\n\n## Janicab malware evolution\n\nA further comparison of the different Janicab versions shows that additional functions were added\nthroughout the malware development cycle, while specific functions were maintained. The table\nbelow shows interesting new functions that were introduced throughout the development of several\nvariants according to the actor’s requirements and/or to evade security controls:\n\n**Function name** **Brief description**\n\nFunction checkRunningProcess() Checks for a list of processes indicating malware analysis\nor process debugging\n\n\nFunction delFFcookies()\n\nFunction delGCcookies()\n\nFunction delIEcookies()\n\n\nPoints to respective browser location and deletes its\ncookies\n\n\nFunction downFile(args) Used to download files from C2 and save them to disk\n\nfunction GetKl(kl) Gets keylogger data, base64 encodes it, then sends it to\nC2\n\nFunction runCmd(cmd, cmdType) Function facilitating command execution using CMD.exe or\nPowerShell.exe\n\nFunction run_dll_or_py(arg1, arg2) Used to execute Python or DLL files while using two\narguments; arg1 is the DLL path and arg2 is the DLL\nexported function name (MyDllEntryPoint)\n\n\n-----\n\nfunction\nadd_to_startup_manager(server,\ninstalledAV)\n\nfunction\nadd_to_startup_reg_import(startupFile,\nstarterFile)\n\nfunction\nadd_to_startup_shortcut(startupFile,\nstarterFile)\n\n\nUsed to register the victim for the first time at the C2;\nperform persistence actions and install Microsoft Sync\n_Services.lnk in system startup folder and registry_\n_HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows_\n_NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon_\n\n\nFunction isMalwb() Function to check if MalwareBytes is installed. Similar\nfunctions were seen in other variants that check for other\nAV products\n\nFunction HandleCCleaner() Checks if CCleaner is installed by checking system\nregistry, and deletes the registry entries accordingly\n\nFunction RunIeScript() Runs ie.vbe script using CScript.exe to ensure no residual\nInternet Explorer instances exists after C2 communication\nuses IE hidden browser\n\nFunction getAV() Gets a list of installed AV products\n\nStarting with version 1.0.8, Janicab VBS implants had several files embedded in the form of byte\narrays. These are usually registry, VBE, PE EXE, or DLL files. In recent samples, while we still see\nembedded byte arrays for such resources, much of the extra resources were placed inside a CAB\narchive file that is dropped in the Stage-1 process.\n\nBelow are noteworthy dropped files and their descriptions:\n\n**Filename** **Description**\n\nK.dll Named Stormwind after a directory it creates, it’s a DLL-based keylogger that\nenumerates system locale, timezone info, and sets a global hook to capture\nkeystrokes. It writes keystrokes with timestamps to a log file named log.log\nunder the \\AppData\\Roaming\\Stormwind directory. It watches for killKL.txt\nunder \\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ReplaceData\\ for the keylogger kill switch\ncommand.\n\nPythonProxy.py An IPv4/IPv6 capable Python-based proxy that is able to relay web traffic\nbetween the local target system and remote C2 server.\n\nSupport HTTP methods CONNECT, ‘OPTIONS’, ‘GET’, ‘HEAD’, ‘POST’, ‘PUT’,\n‘DELETE’, ‘TRACE’\n\nFtp.py Local FTP Python-based server serving on port 2121 with creds test:test.\n\nCreates directory alias to all existing drives except floppy drive, using\n_Junction.exe (a sysinternals tool). Adds regkey to accept EULA since it’s a_\nsysinternal tool asking for EULA if it’s a first time run. Then serves the\n“junctioned” local directories to the FTP server.\n\n\n-----\n\nRunner.py A Python script that takes four arguments: remote SSH server, remote SSH\nport, remote bind port, and “ftp” or “proxy” as application options.\n\nDepending on the argument received for the application option, it runs ftp.py (if\nftp in argument) or pythonproxy.py (if proxy in argument).\n\nIn both options, the script will start an SSH reverse tunnel to a remote server\ncontrolled by the threat actor and use the tunnel as a socks proxy or as a\nmethod to browse the local drives initialized previously with a local FTP server.\n\nIf the killrunner.txt file is found in %temp%\\ReplaceData\\, runner.py will exit.\n\nJunction.exe It is a sysinternals tool https://docs.microsoft.com/enus/sysinternals/downloads/junction.\n\nIt creates NTFS junction points (aliases); creates the “\\\\Drives” directory and\nmaps it to the local FTP server created with ftp.py and serves its content.\n\nPlink.exe Known Windows-based CLI SSH client for pivoting and tunneling\n\nReferenced by Runner.py for reverse tunneling/file copying.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nOne of the distinctive features of Deathstalker is its use of DDRs/web services to host an encoded\nstring that is later deciphered by the malware implant. We consistently see YouTube being used as\na DDR despite other web service links existing in the malware settings and not being used, such as\nlinks to Google+, which was discontinued in April 2019.\n\nAn interesting aspect we have noticed recently is the use of unlisted old YouTube links that were\nused in 2021 intrusions. Historically, an analyst can use search engines and YouTube search\nfeatures to look up the pattern used in the respective web services. However, since the threat actor\nuses unlisted old YouTube links, the likelihood of finding the relevant links on YouTube is almost\nzero. This also effectively allows the threat actor to reuse C2 infrastructure.\n\nInterestingly, old and new Janicab variants are still using identical function declarations for the web\nservices – YouTubeLinks, and continue to use a constant divider in the process of converting the\ndecimal number to backend the C2 IP address. The most recent dividers we have seen in use are\n1337 and 5362.\n\nAs for the actual C2 IP addresses, we found that two IP addresses (87.120.254[.]100,\n87.120.37[.]68) were hosted in the same ASN as the C2s used in PowerPepper intrusions (e.g.,\nPowerPepper C2 87.120.37[.]192) and are based out of Bulgaria.\n\nThe protocol in use for C2 communication is HTTP with GET/POST methods, and the backend C2\nsoftware is PHP.\n\n**IP** **Janicab version** **ASN**\n\n176.223.165[.]196 1.3.2 47447 TTM – 23M GmbH\n\n87.120.254[.]100 1.2.9a 34224 NETERRA-AS – Neterra Ltd.\n\n87.120.37[.]68 1.1.2 4224 NETERRA-AS – Neterra Ltd.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Janicab 2021 listing of DDRs_**\n\n**_Janicab 2015 listing of DDRs_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Sample unlisted YouTube DDR used in recent intrusions_**\n\nWhile assessing one of the C2 servers, we discovered that the threat actor was hosting and calling\nan ICMP shell executable from victim machines. The ICMP shell tool named icmpxa.exe is based\non [an old Github project. The threat actor has compiled icmpsh-s.c (MD5](https://github.com/bdamele/icmpsh)\n5F1A9913AEC43A61F0B3AD7B529B397E) while changing some of its content. The uniqueness of\nthis executable (hash and filename), allowed us to pivot and gather other previously unknown C2\nservers used by the threat actor. Interestingly, we also found that the same ICMP shell executable\nwas used previously in PowerPepper intrusions, indicating a potential infrastructure overlap\nbetween the two malware families.\n\nSince Janicab is a VBS-based malware, C2 commands can be easily derived from the embedded\nfunctions. The malware makes use of VBS functions to connect to the C2 server over HTTP\nGET/POST requests, and to specific PHP pages. Each PHP page provides certain functionality.\nSince the early versions of Janicab, the PHP pages’ file name remained largely the same and\n\n\n-----\n\nindicates the backend/intended function. However, starting from version 1.1.x, the threat actor\nstarted shortening the PHP pages’ file name without changing much of the intended function. The\ntable below summarizes the PHP pages, their old naming, and their potential use:\n\n**PHP page** **Old name** **Description**\n\nStatus2.php Status.php Checks server status\n\na.php Alive.php Receives beacon data from victim\n\n\n/gid.php?\naction=add\n\n\nGenerateID.php?\naction=add\n\n\nIf this is a new victim, generates a user ID and registers\nsystem profile info in the C2 backend; adding a victim to\nthe database\n\n\nrit.php ReportIT.php Records if a user machine is related to an IT person\nafter assessing if the machine has any of the antianalysis checks. In old Janicab versions, a message is\nalso sent as (“it guy”)\n\nc.php GetCLI.php Provides system commands for execution on the victim\nmachine\n\nrs.php ReceiveScreenshot.php Receives screenshot data from the victim\n\nrk.php ReceiveKl.php Receives keylogger data from the victim\n\nsm.php Startup.php?data= Provides the implant with a suitable method to start its\nexecution flow based on available security controls\n\nd.php N/A Downloads saved files from C2 to victim\n\nThe affected entities fall within the traditional sphere of Deathstalker targeting; primarily legal and\nfinancial investment management (FSI) institutions. However, we have also recorded a potentially\nnew affected industry – travel agencies. The Middle East region and Europe were also seen as a\ntypical workspace for Deathstalker with varying intensity between the countries. Interestingly, this is\nthe first time we have noted legal entities in Saudi Arabia being targeted by this group.\n\nThe countries affected by the Janicab intrusions we analyzed are Egypt, Georgia, Saudi Arabia,\nUnited Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.\n\n## Attribution\n\nWe assess with high confidence that the intrusions discussed in this report are associated with the\nDeathstalker threat actor group. The attribution is based on the use of the new Janicab variant,\nunique TTPs, victimology, and infrastructure used by the threat actor operators. Comparative\nintrusion analysis of Janicab and Powersing highlights similarities in several phases of the cyber kill\nchain.\n\nIn summary:\n\nSame SID and metadata for LNK droppers used in previous Deathstalker intrusions;\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilar persistence mechanism between Janicab and Powersing using LNK in the startup\nfolder;\nJanicab has a similar infection execution flow and uses interpreted-language toolsets such as\nVBS, VBE, and Python;\nJanicab macOS and Windows versions have Python file naming similar to EVILNUM malware\n(e.g., runner.py, serial.txt, etc.);\n\n**_EVILNUM runner.py for file transfer_**\n\n**_Janicab 2021 runner.py snippet for file transfer_**\n\n**_Old Janicab for MacOS runner.py for starting background service with file transfer_**\n**_capability_**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe use of Python-based toolset and libraries is common across all Deathstalker intrusions\nusing Janicab, Powersing, EVILNUM, and PowerPepper;\nThe use of YouTube, among other web services/DDRs, is common across Janicab and\nPowersing intrusions; the method of calling and parsing YouTube and the other DDRs for C2\nIP address is almost identical in Janicab, Powersing, and EVILNUM;\nThe identified C2 IPs fall within ASNs seen previously with PowerPepper intrusions;\nDiverse victimology with a focus on legal and financial institutions, possibly targeted by other\nhacker-for-hire threat groups;\nBased on our KTAE similarities engine, the dll (Stormwind) keylogger being used is over 90%\nsimilar to an older variant seen in previous Powersing intrusions;\nIdentical code blocks in old/new Janicab and Powersing:\n\nVirtual machine detection through processes and virtual MAC addresses; the listing\norder for the MAC addresses are identical between both malware families, and even\nbetween the 2015 and 2021 Janicab versions;\nAlmost identical anti-analysis process detection.\n\n**_Janicab 2021 virtual MAC_**\n**_address listing_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Powersing virtual MAC address listing_**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nJanicab is the oldest malware family being used by Deathstalker, dating back to 2013, and it is the\nleast publicly known, perhaps because the associated operators have higher OPSEC standards in\ntheir practices than their counterparts operating EVILNUM and Powersing. Despite not much public\ninformation being available, the threat actor has kept developing and updating the malware code,\nupdating the structure of the LNK droppers and switching the toolset to maintain stealthiness over a\nlong period of time.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on our telemetry, the threat actor remains focused on the Middle East and Europe as its\nmain areas of operation, and shows a lot of interest in compromising legal and financial institutions.\nDespite that focus, we have historically seen the threat actor targeting other industries in rare\nsituations; travel agencies are an example of this. This once again shows the threat actor is likely a\nhack-for-hire group with diverse motivation.\n\nSince the threat actor operators continue to use interpreted-language-based malware such as\nPython, VBE and VBS across their historical and recent intrusions, and largely within their malware\nfamilies, this can be used to the defenders’ advantage since application whitelisting and OS\nhardening are effective techniques to block the threat actor’s intrusion attempts. Defenders should\nalso look for Internet Explorer processes running without GUI since Janicab is using IE in hidden\nmode to communicate with the C2. On the network, the threat actor’s use of a C2 IP address\ninstead of domain names remains a prime method of bypassing DNS-based security controls.\nInstead, the threat actor is still using DDRs as the method to resolve the C2 IP address; an\nalternate technique for DNS resolution by using authentic, mostly allowed, public web services that\nallow C2 communication to blend in with legitimate traffic. This means network defenders can look\nfor frequent visits to the DDR used, followed by HTTP sessions pointing to IP addresses instead of\ndomain names.\n\n## Outlook\n\nAs legal and financial institutions are a common target for this threat actor, we decided to provide a\ncouple of hypotheses on the potential intent of the adversary (customer/operator). Perhaps it\nprovides potential future victims who fall within the affected industries a head start in proactively\npreparing for such intrusions and/or updating their threat model.\n\nSummary of hypotheses for potential intent:\n\nH1: legal dispute that involves VIPs\nH2: legal dispute that involves financial assets\nH3: blackmailing VIPs\nH4: tracking financial assets of/for VIPs\nH5: competitive/business intelligence for medium/large companies\nH6: intelligence on medium/large mergers and acquisitions\n\n## How to protect your organization against this threat\n\nThe detection logic has been improved in all our solutions to ensure that our customers remain\nprotected.
