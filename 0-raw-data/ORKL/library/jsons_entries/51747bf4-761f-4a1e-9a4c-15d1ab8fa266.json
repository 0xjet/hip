    "plain_text": "# Treasury Sanctions Russia with Sweeping New Sanctions Authority\n\n**home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0127**\n\nApril 15, 2021\n\nWASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury took multiple sanctions\nactions under a new Executive Order (E.O.) targeting aggressive and harmful activities by\nthe Government of the Russian Federation. Treasury’s actions include the implementation of\nnew prohibitions on certain dealings in Russian sovereign debt, as well as targeted sanctions\non technology companies that support the Russian Intelligence Services’ efforts to carry out\nmalicious cyber activities against the United States.\n\n“The President signed this sweeping new authority to confront Russia’s continued and\ngrowing malign behavior,” said Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen. “Treasury is leveraging\nthis new authority to impose costs on the Russian government for its unacceptable conduct,\nincluding by limiting Russia’s ability to finance its activities and by targeting Russia’s\nmalicious and disruptive cyber capabilities.”\n\n## NEW AUTHORITY IN RESPONSE TO RUSSIAN MALIGN ACTIVITIES\n\nThe E.O. of April 15, 2021, “Blocking Property with Respect to Specified Harmful Foreign\nActivities of the Government of the Russian Federation,” elevates the U.S. government’s\ncapacity to deploy strategic and economically impactful sanctions to deter and respond to\nRussia’s destabilizing behavior. In particular, this new E.O. authorizes sanctions to counter\n\n\n-----\n\nRussia s harmful foreign activities that threaten the national security and foreign policy of the\nUnited States, including: undermining the conduct of free and fair elections and democratic\ninstitutions in the United States and its allies and partners; engaging in and facilitating\nmalicious cyber activities against the United States and its allies and partners that threaten\nthe free flow of information; fostering and using transnational corruption to influence foreign\ngovernments; pursuing extraterritorial activities targeting dissidents or journalists;\nundermining security in countries and regions important to the United States’ national\nsecurity; and violating well-established principles of international law, including respect for\nthe territorial integrity of states. To address these threats, the E.O. of April 15, 2021\nauthorizes sanctions on a wide range of persons, including, among others, those operating in\nthe technology and defense and related materiel sectors of the Russian Federation\neconomy, and in any additional sectors of the Russian Federation economy as may be\ndetermined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State.\n\n## SOVEREIGN DEBT PROHIBITIONS\n\nPursuant to the E.O. of April 15, 2021, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is\nissuing a directive that generally prohibits U.S. financial institutions from participating in the\nprimary market for ruble or non-ruble denominated bonds issued after June 14, 2021 by the\nCentral Bank of the Russian Federation, the National Wealth Fund of the Russian\nFederation, or the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, and further prohibits U.S.\nfinancial institutions from lending ruble or non-ruble denominated funds to these three\nentities. This directive expands upon existing prohibitions on certain dealings in Russian\nsovereign debt that have been in place since August 2019.\n\n## TREASURY DESIGNATES RUSSIAN COMPANIES IN THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR SUPPORTING RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES\n\nTreasury’s first use of the E.O. of April 15, 2021 targets companies operating in the\ntechnology sector of the Russian Federation economy that support Russian Intelligence\nServices. The following companies are designated for operating in the technology sector of\nthe Russian Federation economy: ERA Technopolis; Pasit, AO (Pasit); Federal State\n**Autonomous Scientific Establishment Scientific Research Institute Specialized**\n**Security Computing Devices and Automation (SVA); Neobit, OOO (Neobit); Advanced**\n**System Technology, AO (AST); and Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies).**\n\nERA Technopolis is a research center and technology park funded and operated by the\nRussian Ministry of Defense. ERA Technopolis houses and supports units of Russia’s Main\nIntelligence Directorate (GRU) responsible for offensive cyber and information operations\nand leverages the personnel and expertise of the Russian technology sector to develop\nmilitary and dual-use technologies.\n\n\n-----\n\nPasit is a Russia-based information technology (IT) company that conducted research and\ndevelopment in support of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service’s (SVR) malicious cyber\noperations.\n\nSVA is a Russian state-owned research institute specializing in advanced systems for\ninformation security located in Russia. SVA conducted research and development in support\nof the SVR’s malicious cyber operations.\n\nNeobit is a Saint Petersburg, Russia-based IT security firm whose clients include the\nRussian Ministry of Defense, SVR, and Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB). Neobit\nconducted research and development in support of the cyber operations conducted by the\nFSB, GRU, and SVR. Neobit was also designated today pursuant to cyber-related E.O.\n13694, as amended by E.O. 13757, WMD-related E.O. 13382, and the Countering America’s\nAdversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for providing material support to the GRU.\n\nAST is a Russian IT security firm whose clients include the Russian Ministry of Defense,\nSVR, and FSB. AST provided technical support to cyber operations conducted by the FSB,\nGRU, and SVR. AST was also designated today pursuant to E.O. 13694, E.O. 13382, and\nCAATSA for providing support to the FSB.\n\nPositive Technologies is a Russian IT security firm that supports Russian Government\nclients, including the FSB. Positive Technologies provides computer network security\nsolutions to Russian businesses, foreign governments, and international companies and\nhosts large-scale conventions that are used as recruiting events for the FSB and GRU.\nPositive Technologies was also designated today pursuant to E.O. 13694, E.O. 13382, and\nCAATSA for providing support to the FSB.\n\n## SANCTIONS TARGET RUSSIAN MALICIOUS CYBER ACTORS\n\nThe Russian Intelligence Services — specifically the Federal Security Service (FSB),\nRussia’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) —\nhave executed some of the most dangerous and disruptive cyber attacks in recent history,\nincluding the SolarWinds cyber attack. The FSB and GRU were previously sanctioned in\n2016, and again in 2018, for malicious cyber activity, and most recently on March 2, 2021 for\nactivities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD).\n\nThe FSB was involved in the August 2020 poisoning of Aleksey Navalny with a chemical\nweapon, specifically a nerve agent known as Novichok. The GRU also engaged in activities\nthat materially contributed to the possession, transportation, and use of Novichok related to a\nMarch 2018 poisoning in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe FSB has also used its cyber capabilities to target Russian journalists and others who\nopenly criticize the regime, as well as U.S. government personnel and millions of private\ncitizens around the world. To bolster its malicious cyber operations, the FSB cultivates and\n\n\n-----\n\nco-opts criminal hackers, including the previously designated Evil Corp, enabling them to\nengage in disruptive ransomware attacks and phishing campaigns.\n\nThe GRU’s malign cyber activities include deployment of the NotPetya and Olympic\nDestroyer malware; intrusions targeting the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical\nWeapons and the World Anti-Doping Agency; cyber attacks on government systems and\ncritical infrastructure in Ukraine and the state of Georgia; and hack-and-leak operations\ntargeting elections in the United States and France.\n\nIn addition, the Russian Intelligence Services’ third arm, the SVR, is responsible for the 2020\nexploit of the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures.\nThis intrusion compromised thousands of U.S. government and private sector networks.\nThe scope and scale of this compromise combined with Russia’s history of carrying out\nreckless and disruptive cyber operations makes it a national security concern. The SVR has\nput at risk the global technology supply chain by allowing malware to be installed on the\nmachines of tens of thousands of SolarWinds’ customers. Victims of the compromise include\nthe financial sector, critical infrastructure, government networks, and many others. Further,\nthis incident will cost businesses and consumers in the United States and worldwide millions\nof dollars to fully address.\n\nAdditionally, the SVR stole “red team tools,” which mimic cyber attacks to help customers\nbetter protect themselves, from a U.S. cyber security company. These tools, if made public\nor used offensively by the SVR or other actors, would create additional opportunities for\nmalign actors to target computer systems worldwide.\n\nThe private and state-owned companies designated today enable the Russian Intelligence\nServices’ cyber activities. These companies provide a range of services to the FSB, GRU,\nand SVR, ranging from providing expertise, to developing tools and infrastructure, to\nfacilitating malicious cyber activities.\n\n## SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS\n\nAs a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons\ndescribed above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons\nare blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly\nor indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless\nauthorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC’s regulations\ngenerally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States\nthat involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.\nThe prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or\nservices by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person or the receipt of any contribution or\nprovision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\n\n###\n\n\n-----\n\nUse featured image\n\nOff\n\n\n-----",
