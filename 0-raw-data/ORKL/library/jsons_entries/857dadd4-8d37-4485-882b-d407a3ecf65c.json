    "plain_text": "# Russian National Extradited to United States to Face Charges for Alleged Role in Cybercriminal Organization\n\n**[justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-extradited-united-states-face-charges-alleged-role-cybercriminal](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-extradited-united-states-face-charges-alleged-role-cybercriminal)**\n\nOctober 28, 2021\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\nOffice of Public Affairs\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nThursday, October 28, 2021\n\nA Russian national, residing in the Yakutsk region of Russia and in Southeast Asia, had his\ninitial appearance in federal court today after his extradition from the Republic of Korea to the\nNorthern District of Ohio to face charges for his alleged role in a transnational, cybercriminal\norganization.\n\nAccording to court documents, Vladimir Dunaev, 38, was a member of a transnational,\ncybercriminal organization that deployed a computer banking trojan and ransomware suite of\nmalware known as “Trickbot.”\n\n“Trickbot attacked businesses and victims across the globe and infected millions of\ncomputers for theft and ransom, including networks of schools, banks, municipal\ngovernments, and companies in the health care, energy, and agriculture sectors,” said\nDeputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. “This is the second overseas Trickbot defendant\narrested in recent months, making clear that, with our international partners, the Department\nof Justice can and will capture cyber criminals around the world. This is another success for\nthe Department’s recently launched Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force in\ndismantling ransomware groups and disrupting the cybercriminal ecosystem that allows\nransomware to exist and to threaten our critical infrastructure.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe FBI is determined to utilize our unique tools and capabilities to disrupt transnational\ncybercriminal organizations, such as the group that developed and delivered Trickbot, and\nremains committed to imposing risk and consequence upon these criminals,” said Deputy\nDirector Paul Abbate of the FBI. “Pursuing cyber criminals requires considerable patience,\nexpertise, and resources, but the FBI has a long memory and will ensure that these\nmalicious actors cannot evade detection or avoid the full weight of law enforcement actions.”\n\n“The Trickbot malware was designed to steal the personal and financial information of\nmillions of people around the world, thereby causing extensive financial harm and inflicting\nsignificant damage to critical infrastructure within the United States and abroad,” said Acting\nU.S. Attorney Bridget M. Brennan of the Northern District of Ohio. “Today’s announcement\nunderscores the great lengths federal law enforcement officials and our international partners\nwill go to hold these alleged cybercriminals accountable for their actions.”\n\n“This indictment reflects the dynamic landscape in which international criminals utilize\nsophisticated cyber methods to take advantage of and defraud, unsuspecting victims\nanywhere in the world,” said Special Agent in Charge Eric Smith of the FBI’s Cleveland Field\nOffice. “This multi-year investigation demonstrates the commitment by the FBI to\naggressively pursue these individuals despite the complexity and global character cyber\ninvestigations can so often bring. The FBI encourages any victim of cyber fraud to file a\nreport with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center at www.ic3.gov.”\n\nThe indictment alleges that beginning in November 2015, and continuing through August\n2020, Dunaev and others stole money, confidential information, and damaged computer\nsystems from unsuspecting victims, including individuals, financial institutions, school\ndistricts, utility companies, government entities, and private businesses. To perpetuate their\ncriminal scheme, the defendants allegedly used a network of co-conspirators and freelance\ncomputer programmers, known as the Trickbot Group, to create, deploy, and manage the\nTrickbot malware, which infected millions of computers and computer systems worldwide.\n\nDunaev is alleged to have been one such co-conspirator, working as a malware developer\nfor the Trickbot Group. Dunaev allegedly performed a variety of developer functions in\nsupport of the Trickbot malware, including managing the malware’s execution, developing\npopular browser modifications and helping to conceal the malware from detection by security\nsoftware.\n\n[Earlier this year, the Justice Department announced the arrest and arraignment of Alla Witte,](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/latvian-national-charged-alleged-role-transnational-cybercrime-organization)\na Latvian national charged for her role in the Trickbot Group.\n\nAccording to court documents, the Trickbot malware was designed to capture online banking\nlogin credentials and harvest other personal information, including credit card numbers,\nemails, passwords, dates of birth, social security numbers, and addresses from infected\ncomputers through the use of web injects and keystroke logging. Later versions of Trickbot\nwere adapted to facilitate the installation and use of ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to the indictment, the defendants used these stolen login credentials and other\npersonal information to gain access to online bank accounts, execute unauthorized\nelectronic funds transfers and launder the money through U.S. and foreign beneficiary\naccounts.\n\nDunaev was extradited from the Republic of Korea on Oct. 20. He is charged with conspiracy\nto commit computer fraud and aggravated identity theft, conspiracy to commit wire and bank\nfraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and multiple counts of wire fraud, bank fraud,\nand aggravated identity theft. If convicted of all counts, Dunaev faces a maximum penalty of\n60 years’ imprisonment. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after\nconsidering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThis case was investigated by the FBI’s Cleveland Field Office.\n\nThe Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs provided invaluable assistance in\nsecuring the arrest and extradition of Dunaev to the United States, with substantial support\nprovided by the Republic of Korea.\n\nSenior Counsel C.S. Heath of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual\nProperty Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel J. Riedl and Duncan T. Brown of the\nNorthern District of Ohio are prosecuting the case.\n\nThis case is part of the Department of Justice’s Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task\nForce, which was created to combat the growing number of ransomware and digital extortion\nattacks. As part of the Task Force, the Criminal Division, working with the U.S. Attorneys’\nOffices, prioritizes the disruption, investigation, and prosecution of ransomware and digital\nextortion activity by tracking and dismantling the development and deployment of malware,\nidentifying the cybercriminals responsible, and holding those individuals accountable for their\ncrimes. The department, through the Task Force, also strategically targets the ransomware\ncriminal ecosystem as a whole and collaborates with domestic and foreign government\nagencies as well as private sector partners to combat this significant criminal threat.\n\n_An indictment is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven_\n_guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law._\n\nAttachment(s):\n\n[Download Dunaev Redacted](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1445241/download)\nTopic(s):\n\nCybercrime\n\nPress Release Number:\n\n21-1065\n\n\n-----",
