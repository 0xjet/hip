These individuals used various ruses, such as email\nphishing, to install the malware onto the computers of unsuspecting victims. Raccoon\nInfostealer then stole personal data from victim computers, including log-in credentials,\nfinancial information, and other personal records. Stolen information was used to commit\nfinancial crimes or was sold to others on cybercrime forums.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn March 2022, concurrent with Sokolovsky s arrest by Dutch authorities, the FBI and law\nenforcement partners in Italy and the Netherlands dismantled the digital infrastructure\nsupporting the Raccoon Infostealer, taking its then existing version offline.\n\nThrough various investigative steps, the FBI has collected data stolen from many\ncomputers that cyber criminals infected with Raccoon Infostealer. While an exact number\nhas yet to be verified, FBI agents have identified more than 50 million unique credentials\nand forms of identification (email addresses, bank accounts, cryptocurrency addresses,\ncredit card numbers, etc.) in the stolen data from what appears to be millions of potential\nvictims around the world. The credentials appear to include over four million email\naddresses. The United States does not believe it is in possession of all the data stolen by\nRaccoon Infostealer and continues to investigate.\n\nThe FBI has created a website where anyone can input their email address to determine\nwhether it is contained within the U.S. government’s repository of Raccoon Infostealer\nstolen data. The website is raccoon.ic3.gov. If the email address is within the data, the FBI\nwill send an email to that address notifying the user. Potential victims are encouraged to\nfill out a detailed complaint and share any financial or other harm experienced from their\ninformation being stolen at FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at\nic3.gov/Home/FileComplaint.\n\n“This case highlights the importance of the international cooperation that the Department\nof Justice and our partners use to dismantle modern cyber threats,” said Deputy Attorney\nGeneral Lisa O. Monaco. “As reflected in the number of potential victims and global\nbreadth of this attack, cyber threats do not respect borders, which makes international\ncooperation all the more critical. I urge anyone who thinks they could be a victim to follow\nthe FBI’s guidance on how to report your potential exposure.”\n\n“I applaud the hard work of the agents and prosecutors involved in this case as well as our\ninternational partners for their efforts to disrupt the Raccoon Infostealer and gather the\nevidence necessary for indictment and notification to potential victims,” U.S. Attorney\nAshley C. Hoff said. “This type of malware feeds the cybercrime ecosystem, harvesting\nvaluable information and allowing cyber criminals to steal from innocent Americans and\ncitizens around the world. I urge the public to visit the FBI’s Raccoon Infostealer website,\nfind out if their email is within the stolen data, and file a victim complaint through the FBI’s\nIC3 website.”\n\n“Today’s case is a further reminder the FBI will relentlessly pursue and bring to justice\ncyber criminals who seek to steal from the American public,” said FBI Deputy Director Paul\nAbbate. “We have once again leveraged our unique authorities, world-class capabilities,\nand enduring international partnerships to maximize impact against cyber threats. We will\ncontinue to use all available resources to disrupt these attacks and protect American\ncitizens. If you believe you’re a victim of this cybercrime, we urge you to visit\nraccoon.ic3.gov.”\n\n“This case highlights the FBI’s unwavering commitment to work closely with our law\nenforcement and private sector partners around the world to hold cybercriminals\naccountable for their actions and protect the American people from cybercrime,” said FBI\nSpecial Agent in Charge Oliver E. Rich Jr. “This case also serves as a reminder to public\nand private sector organizations of the importance to report internet crime and cyber\nthreats to law enforcement as soon as possible. Working together is the only way we’re\ngoing to stay ahead of rapidly changing cyber threats.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThis indictment demonstrates the resolve and close cooperation of the Army Criminal\nInvestigation Division and the FBI working jointly to protect and defend the United States,”\nstated Special Agent in Charge Marc Martin, Army CID’s Cyber Field Office. “Army CID\nwould also like to thank our law enforcement partners in Italy and the Netherlands.”\n\nSokolovsky is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and related\nactivity in connection with computers; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud; one\ncount of conspiracy to commit money laundering; and one count of aggravated identity\ntheft. The Amsterdam District Court issued a decision on September 13, 2022, granting\nthe defendant’s extradition to the United States. Sokolovsky has appealed that decision.\n\nIf convicted, Sokolovsky faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for the wire fraud\nand money laundering offenses, five years for the conspiracy to commit computer fraud\ncharge, and a mandatory consecutive two-year term for the aggravated identity theft\noffense. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe FBI’s Austin Cyber Task Force, with the assistance of the Department of the Army\nCriminal Investigation Division (Army CID), is investigating the case. The FBI Austin Cyber\nTask Force is supported by Army CID, Austin Police Department, the Naval Criminal\nInvestigative Service, the Round Rock Police Department and the Texas Department of\nPublic Safety.\n\nVictims of the Raccoon Infostealer can find more information at www.justice.gov/usaowdtx/victim-assistance-raccoon-infostealer. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael C. Galdo and\nG. Karthik Srinivasan are prosecuting the case. The Department of Justice’s Office of\nInternational Affairs is assisting with foreign evidence requests and the extradition request.\n\nU.S. Attorney Hoff and Special Agent in Charge Rich would also like to thank the FBI\nLegal Attachés in Rome, The Hague, and Warsaw for their assistance in the investigation\nand disruption of the Raccoon Infostealer, along with the following foreign partners:\nMinistry of Justice of Italy; Special Unit for the Protection of Privacy and Technological\nFraud of the Italian Guardia di Finanza; Procura della Repubblica di Brescia; the\nNetherlands Ministry of Justice and Security; Netherlands Police; and Netherlands Public\nProsecution Service.\n\n**_An indictment is merely an allegation and the defendant is presumed innocent until_**\n**_proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law._**\n\n**###**\n\nTopic(s):\n\nCybercrime\n\nComponent(s):\n\n[USAO - Texas, Western](http://www.justice.gov/usao-wdtx)\n\n\n-----",
