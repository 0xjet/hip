To resolve the\nsituation, the entire parliament had to be taken offline for days. IT experts estimate that a\ntotal of 16 gigabytes of data were downloaded from Parliament as part of the attack.[27]\n\n[The group is also suspected to be behind a spear phishing attack in August 2016 on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spear_phishing)\nmembers of the [Bundestag and multiple political parties such as Linken-faction leader Sahra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundestag)\nWagenknecht, [Junge Union and the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junge_Union) [CDU of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democratic_Union_of_Germany) [Saarland.[28][29][30][31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saarland) Authorities feared that\nsensitive information could be gathered by hackers to later manipulate the public ahead of\nelections such as Germany's next federal election which was due in September 2017.[28]\n\n\n### U.S. military wives' death threats (February 10, 2015)\n\nFive wives of U.S. military personnel received death threats from a hacker group calling itself\n\"CyberCaliphate\", claiming to be an Islamic State affiliate, on February 10, 2015.[32][33][34][35]\n[This was later discovered to have been a false flag attack by Fancy Bear, when the victims'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag)\nemail addresses were found to have been in the Fancy Bear phishing target list.[33] Russian\nsocial media trolls have also been known to hype and rumor monger the threat of potential\nIslamic State terror attacks on U.S. soil in order to sow fear and political tension.[33]\n\n\n### French television hack (April 2015)\n\n[On April 8, 2015, French television network TV5Monde was the victim of a cyber-attack by a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV5Monde)\nhacker group calling itself \"CyberCaliphate\" and claiming to have ties to the terrorist\n[organization Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). French investigators later discounted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant)\nthe theory that militant Islamists were behind the cyber-attack, instead suspecting the\ninvolvement of Fancy Bear.[36]\n\n\nHackers breached the network's internal systems, possibly aided by passwords openly\nbroadcast by TV5,[37] overriding the broadcast programming of the company's 12 channels\nfor over three hours.[38] Service was only partially restored in the early hours of the following\nmorning and normal broadcasting services were disrupted late into April 9.[38] Various\ncomputerised internal administrative and support systems including e-mail were also still\nshut down or otherwise inaccessible due to the attack.[39][38] The hackers also hijacked\n[TV5Monde's Facebook and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook) [Twitter pages to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter) [post the personal information of relatives of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing)\nFrench soldiers participating in actions against ISIS, along with messages critical of\nPresident [François Hollande, arguing that the January 2015 terrorist attacks were \"gifts\" for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Hollande)\nhis \"unforgivable mistake\" of partaking in conflicts that \"[serve] no purpose\".[40][38]\n\nThe director-general of TV5Monde, Yves Bigot, later said that the attack nearly destroyed the\ncompany; if it had taken longer to restore broadcasting, satellite distribution channels would\nhave been likely to cancel their contracts. The attack was designed to be destructive, both of\nequipment and of the company itself, rather than for propaganda or espionage, as had been\nthe case for most other cyber-attacks. The attack was carefully planned; the first known\npenetration of the network was on January 23, 2015.[41] The attackers then carried out\n\n\n-----\n\nreconnaissance of TV5Monde to understand the way in which it broadcast its signals, and\nconstructed bespoke malicious software to corrupt and destroy the Internet-connected\nhardware that controlled the TV station's operations, such as the encoder systems. They\nused seven different points of entry, not all part of TV5Monde or even in France—one was a\ncompany based in the Netherlands that supplied the remote controlled cameras used in\nTV5's studios.[41] Between February 16 and March 25 the attackers collected data on TV5\n[internal platforms, including its IT Internal Wiki, and verified that login credentials were still](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki)\nvalid.[41] [During the attack, the hackers ran a series of commands extracted from TACACS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TACACS)\nlogs to erase the [firmware from switches and routers.[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware)\n\nAlthough the attack purported to be from IS, France's cyber-agency told Bigot to say only\nthat the messages claimed to be from IS. He was later told that evidence had been found\nthat the attackers were the APT 28 group of Russian hackers. No reason was found for the\ntargeting of TV5Monde, and the source of the order to attack, and funding for it, is not\nknown. It has been speculated that it was probably an attempt to test forms of cyberweaponry. The cost was estimated at €5m ($5.6m; £4.5m) in the first year, followed by\nrecurring annual cost of over €3m ($3.4m; £2.7m) for new protection. The company's way of\nworking had to change, with authentication of email, checking of flash drives before insertion,\nand so on, at significant detriment to efficiency for a news media company that must move\ninformation.[42]\n\n### root9B report (May 2015)\n\n\nSecurity firm [root9B released a report on Fancy Bear in May 2015 announcing its discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Root9B&action=edit&redlink=1)\nof a targeted spear phishing attack aimed at financial institutions.

According to the root9B, preparations for the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto-Dominion_Bank)\nattacks started in June 2014 and the malware used \"bore specific signatures that have\nhistorically been unique to only one organization, Sofacy.\"[43] [Security journalist Brian Krebs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Krebs)\nquestioned the accuracy of root9B's claims, postulating that the attacks had actually\noriginated from Nigerian phishers.[44] In June 2015 well respected security researcher\nClaudio Guarnieri published a report based on his own investigation of a concurrent\nSOFACY attributed exploit against the German Bundestag[45] and credited root9B with\n[having reported, \"the same IP address used as Command & Control server in the attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control_(malware))\nagainst Bundestag (176.31.112.10)\", and went on to say that based on his examination of\nthe Bundestag attack, \"at least some\" indicators contained within root9B's report appeared\naccurate, including a comparison of the hash of the malware sample from both incidents.\nroot9B later published a technical report comparing Claudio's analysis of SOFACY attributed\nmalware to their own sample, adding to the veracity of their original report.[46]\n\n### EFF spoof, White House and NATO attack (August 2015)\n\n\n-----\n\n[In August 2015, Fancy Bear used a zero-day exploit of Java,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) [spoofing the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack) Electronic Frontier\n[Foundation and launching attacks on the White House and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House) [NATO.

One of these accounts may have yielded up to date contact lists.\nThe next day, phishing attacks expanded to the non-public email addresses of high level\nDemocratic Party officials. Hillaryclinton.com addresses were attacked, but required two\nfactor authentication for access. The attack redirected towards Gmail accounts on March 19.\nPodesta's Gmail account was breached the same day, with 50,000 emails stolen. The\nphishing attacks intensified in April,[60] although the hackers seemed to become suddenly\ninactive for the day on April 15, which in Russia was a holiday in honor of the military's\nelectronic warfare services.[61] The malware used in the attack sent stolen data to the same\n[servers that were used for the group's 2015 attack on the German parliament.[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundestag)\n\nOn June 14, CrowdStrike released a report publicizing the DNC hack and identifying Fancy\n[Bear as the culprits.

However the two groups each\nappeared to be unaware of the other, as each independently stole the same passwords and\notherwise duplicated their efforts. Cozy Bear appears to be a different agency, one more\ninterested in traditional long-term espionage.[61] A CrowdStrike forensic team determined that\nwhile Cozy Bear had been on the DNC's network for over a year, Fancy Bear had only been\nthere a few weeks.[1]\n\n### Ukrainian artillery\n\n[An infected version of an app to control the D-30 Howitzer was allegedly distributed to the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/122_mm_howitzer_2A18_(D-30))\nUkrainian artillery\n[See also: Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_intervention_in_Ukraine_(2014%E2%80%93present))\nAccording to [CrowdStrike from 2014 to 2016, the group used Android malware to target the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike)\n[Ukrainian Army's Rocket Forces and Artillery.

One cybersecurity research group noted their use of six different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing))\nzero-day exploits in 2015, a technical feat that would require large numbers of programmers\nseeking out previously unknown vulnerabilities in top-of-the-line commercial software. This is\nregard[92][93] ed as a sign that Fancy Bear is a state-run program and not a gang or a lone hacker.\n\n\nOne of Fancy Bear's preferred targets is web-based email services. A typical compromise\nwill consist of web-based email users receiving an email urgently requesting that they\nchange their passwords to avoid being hacked. The email will contain a link to a spoof\nwebsite that is designed to mimic a real webmail interface, users will attempt to login and\n\n\n-----\n\n[their credentials will be stolen. The URL is often obscured as a shortened bit.ly link[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit.ly) ] in\norder to get past [spam filters. Fancy Bear sends these phishing emails primarily on Mondays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_filter)\nand Fridays. They also send emails purportedly containing links to news items, but instead\n[linking to malware drop sites that install toolkits onto the target's computer.[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolkits) Fancy Bear\nalso registers domains that resemble legitimate websites, then create a spoof of the site to\nsteal credentials from their victims.[62] Fancy Bear has been known to relay its command\ntraffic through proxy networks of victims that it has previously compromised.[95]\n\nSoftware that Fancy Bear has used includes ADVSTORESHELL, CHOPSTICK, JHUHUGIT,\nand XTunnel. Fancy Bear utilises a number of implants, including Foozer, WinIDS, [X-Agent,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Agent_(spyware))\nX-Tunnel, Sofacy, and DownRange droppers.[62] Based on compile times, FireEye concluded\nthat Fancy Bear has consistently updated their malware since 2007.[95] To avert detection,\nFancy Bear returns to the environment to switch their implants, changes its command and\ncontrol channels, and modifies its persistent methods.[91] The threat group implements\n[counter-analysis techniques to obfuscate their code. They add junk data to encoded strings,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_masking)\nmaking decoding difficult without the junk removal algorithm.[95] Fancy Bear takes measures\nto prevent [forensic analysis of its hacks, resetting the timestamps on files and periodically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_forensics)\nclearing the event logs.[62]\n\n\nAccording to an indictment by the United States Special Counsel, X-Agent was \"developed,\ncustomized, and monitored\" by GRU Lieutenant Captain Nikolay Yuryevich Kozachek.[2]\n\nFancy Bear has been known to tailor implants for target environments, for instance\nreconfiguring them to use local email servers.[95] In August 2015, Kaspersky Lab detected\nand blocked a version of the ADVSTORESHELL implant that had been used to target\ndefense contractors. An hour and a half following the block, Fancy Bear actors had compiled\nand delivered a new backdoor for the implant.[23]\n\n\n## Education\n\nUnit 26165 was involved in the design of the curriculum at several Moscow public schools,\nincluding School 1101.[96]\n\n## Related personas\n\n\nFancy Bear sometimes creates online personas to sow disinformation, deflect blame, and\ncreate plausible deniability for their activities.[97]\n\n### Guccifer 2.0\n\nMain article: [Guccifer 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guccifer_2.0)\nAn online persona that first appeared and claimed responsibility for the DNC hacks the same\nday the story broke that Fancy Bear was responsible.[98] [Guccifer 2.0 claims to be a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guccifer_2.0)\n[Romanian hacker, but when interviewed by Motherboard magazine, they were asked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanians)\n\n\n-----\n\n[questions in Romanian and appeared to be unable to speak the language.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language) ] Some\ndocuments they have released appear to be forgeries cobbled together from material from\nprevious hacks and publicly available information, then salted with disinformation.[99]\n\n### Fancy Bears' Hack Team\n\n\nA website created to leak documents taken in the WADA and IAAF attacks was fronted with\na brief manifesto dated September 13, 2016, proclaiming that the site is owned by \"Fancy\nBears' hack team\", which it said is an \"international hack team\" who \"stand for fair play and\nclean sport\".[100] The site took responsibility for hacking WADA and promised that it would\nprovide \"sensational proof of famous athletes taking doping substances\", beginning with the\nUS Olympic team, which it said \"disgraced its name by tainted victories\".[100] WADA said\nsome of the documents leaked under this name were forgeries, and that data had been\nchanged.[101][100]\n\n### Anonymous Poland\n\n\nA [Twitter account named \"Anonymous Poland\" (@anpoland) claimed responsibility for the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter)\nattack on the [World Anti-Doping Agency[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency) and released data stolen from the Court of\nArbitration for Sport, a secondary target.[103][104] ThreatConnect supports the view that\nAnonymous Poland is a sockpuppet of Fancy Bear, noting the change from a historical focus\non internal politics.
