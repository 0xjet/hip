    "plain_text": "# North American Electric Cyber Threat\n Perspective\n\nJanuary 2020\n\n## Summary\n\nThe electric utility industry is a valuable target for adversaries seeking to exploit industrial control systems\n(ICS) and operations technology (OT) for a variety of purposes. A power disruption event from a cyberattack\ncan occur from multiple components of an electric system including disruptions of the operational systems\nused for situational awareness and energy trading, targeting enterprise environments to achieve an enabling\nattack through interconnected and interdependent IT systems, or through a direct compromise of cyber digital\nassets used within OT environments. Attacks on electric systems – like attacks on other critical infrastructure\nsectors – can further an adversary’s criminal, political, economic, or geopolitical goals. As adversaries and their\nsponsors invest more effort and money into obtaining effects-focused capabilities, the risk of a disruptive or\ndestructive attack on the electric sector significantly increases.\n\nThe number of publicly known attacks impacting ICS environments around the world continues to increase,\nand correspondingly the potential risk due to a disruptive cyber event impacting the North American electric\nsector is currently assessed as high. This report highlights multiple threats and adversaries focusing on critical\ninfrastructure and their capabilities. Dragos anticipates the threat landscape associated with the sector will\nremain high as the detected intrusions continue to rise.\n\nOf the activity groups that Dragos is actively tracking, nearly two-thirds of the groups performing ICS specific\ntargeting and disruption activities are focused on the North American electric sector. Additionally, existing\nthreats to ICS are expanding and establishing new interest in electric utility operations in North America. For\nexample, the Dragos tracked activity group XENOTIME – the most dangerous and capable activity group –\ninitially focused its targeting efforts on oil and gas operations before expanding to include North American\nelectric utilities. Dragos also identified the MAGNALLIUM activity group expanding targeting to include electric\nutilities in the US. This activity group expansion and shift to the electric sector coincided with increasing\npolitical and military tensions in Gulf Coast Countries (GCC).\n\nDragos research of the CRASHOVERRIDE attack indicates ELECTRUM targeted recovery operations. Such\nactivity, if successful, could prolong outages following a cyberattack and cause physical damage to equipment\nor harm to operators. These findings suggest the group had greater ambitions than what it achieved during its\n2016 attack, and represent worrying possibilities for safety and protection-focused attacks in the future.\n\nHistorically, adversaries have demonstrated the capabilities to significantly disrupt electric operations in largescale cyber events through specialized malware and deep knowledge of targets’ operations environments.\nAlthough North America has not experienced similar attacks, ICS-targeting adversaries exhibit the interest and\nability to target such networks with activities that could facilitate such attacks.\n\n\n# North American Electric Cyber Threat\n Perspective\n\nJanuary 2020\n\n\n-----\n\nlevel decisions,[1] preparedness exercises like GridEx, the NERC CIP standards, and direct investment in ICSspecific security technologies. However, adversaries will continue to evolve and the industry must be ready to\nadapt.\n\nThis report provides a snapshot of the threat landscape as of January 2020 and is expected to change in the\nfuture as adversaries and their behaviors evolve.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n  - The threat landscape focusing on electric utilities in North America is expansive and increasing, led by\nnumerous intrusions into ICS networks for reconnaissance and research purposes and ICS activity\ngroups demonstrating new interest the electric sector.\n\n  - Attacks on electric utilities can have significant geopolitical, humanitarian, and economic impact. Thus,\nstate-associated actors will increasingly target power and related industries like natural gas to further\ntheir goals.\n\n  - One significant threat includes active supply chain compromises by activity groups targeting original\nequipment manufacturers, third-party vendors, and telecommunications providers.\n\n  - Research into the 2016 CRASHOVERRIDE attack demonstrates the adversary’s intent and ability to\ntarget protection and safety operations to cause prolonged outages, equipment destruction, and\nhuman health and safety concerns.\n\n  - Utilities are slowly improving visibility in electric operational environments, and current regulatory\nstandards in North America ensure the electric power sector maintains a minimum level of\ncybersecurity for all of the in-scope facilities. Further recommendations are included in this report for\nasset owners and operators to address cyber risk in their operations environment.\n\n  - The complete “energy infrastructure sector” (electric, oil and gas, etc) of all countries are at risk as\ncompanies and utilities are facing multiple global adversaries. Cyberattacks are an increasing means\nto project dominance using cyberattacks in the energy domain.\n\n## Activity Groups\n\nDragos tracks seven activity groups[2] targeting electric utilities in North America, and 11 total groups. Dragos\ndoes not perform state or actor attribution of activity groups and none should be implied.\n\n1 https://dragos.com/wp-content/uploads/yir-execs-2018.pdf\n2 Dragos categorizes ICS-targeting activity into activity groups based on observable elements that include an adversary’s methods of operation,\ninfrastructure used to execute actions, and the targets they focus on. The goal, as defined by the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis, is to delineate\nan adversary by their observed actions, capabilities, and demonstrated impact– not implied or assumed intentions. These attributes combine to create\na construct around which defensive plans can be built. At this time, two activity groups possess ICS-specific capabilities and tools to cause disruptive\nevents: XENOTIME and ELECTRUM.\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc. All rights reserved.

That is,\nthreats to one ICS entity are potential threats to other industrial verticals. Adversaries are increasingly targeting\nmultiple verticals with purposes including espionage, information gathering, and potentially disruptive events.[21]\n\nThis trend is driven by multiple variables including an increasing investment to develop offensive capabilities\nspecifically for ICS-targeting operations. Attackers are obtaining the skills necessary for a cyber-physical event\nas greater attention is paid to ICS in general and as open-source information on industrial networks, protocols,\nand devices becomes more widely available. Additionally, the spread of commodity IT hardware and software\ninto OT networks increases the attack surface, providing ingress opportunities via techniques familiar to the\nadversary.\n\nTherefore, all energy-related entities should be familiar with malicious activity across critical infrastructure\nsectors.\n\n## Overview of the North American Electric System\n\nThe phrase “electric grid” as a single entity is a bit of a misnomer. The way power is generated, transmitted,\nand distributed across North America is best described as an electric system: the Bulk Electric System.

These Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards have\nseveral requirements for in-scope facilities and systems across Bulk Electric System (BES). These regulations\nare also used outside of the United States across North America. Each Canadian province adopts the standards\nfor their utilities and the Mexican regulator, Comisión Reguladora de Energia (CRE),works with NERC on\nreliability efforts and defines cybersecurity rules for their country.[23] The NERC CIP Reliability Standards are\nseperated into several topic areas, outlined below:\n\n**CIP-002-5.1** Bulk Electric System (BES) Cyber System Categorization\nCIP-003-6 Security Management Controls\nCIP-004-6 Personnel & Training\nCIP-005-5 Electronic Security Perimeter(s)\nCIP-006-6 Physical Security of BES Cyber Systems\nCIP-007-6 System Security Management\nCIP-008-5 Incident Reporting and Response Planning\nCIP-009-6 Recovery Plans for BES Cyber Systems\nCIP-010-2 Configuration Change Management and Vulnerability Assessments\nCIP-011-2 Information Protection\nCIP-014-2 Physical Security\n\nA new standard, CIP-013 on supply chain cyber risk management, will be mandatory in July 2020. There are\nperiodically updates to the NERC CIP Reliability Standards based on FERC rulemakings or industry efforts to\naddress new topic areas or requirements.\n\nAdhering to cybersecurity regulations makes North American electric utilities unique in the ICS industry by\nensuring a minimum level of cybersecurity best practices are maintained.\n\n22 https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=27152\n23 https://www.ferc.gov/CalendarFiles/20180731083631-Madrigal,%20CRE.pdf\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.

The transmission system then carries electricity\nacross long distances from the generation power plants to distribution substations. From there it is distributed\nto customers. The transmission and distribution systems include substations to transform voltage levels, serve\nas switching stations, and provide electric power to consumers.\n\n### Generation \n\n**THREAT LANDSCAPE**\n\nAt this time, Dragos assesses at least three activity groups demonstrate the intent or capability to infiltrate or\ndisrupt electric power generation operational networks. XENOTIME has demonstrated the capability to access,\noperate, and conduct attacks in an industrial environment. Dragos assesses this group would be capable of\nrefocusing its disruptive efforts on electric utilities since it has already affected safety instrumented systems,\nin the Triconex, which are a mainstay in power generation. Additionally, DYMALLOY targeted generation\nfacilities and demonstrated the ability to obtain screenshots of sensitive ICS data including screenshots of\nhuman machine interfaces (HMIs). ALLANITE poses a threat to generation as it shares some similarities in\ntargeting and capabilities with DYMALLOY along with proven reconnaissance and exfil of sensitive data from\noperational environments. Neither group has demonstrated ICS-disruptive or destructive capabilities, as they\nfocused on operational environment reconnaissance.\n\n**ASSESSMENT**\n\nAt this time, ICS-targeting adversaries have not successfully disrupted electric generation operations in North\nAmerica, however, we do note a communications disruption that was reported to NERC earlier this year. The\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc. All rights reserved. [Protected] Non-confidential content.

It impacted 200MW of load at a transmission\nsubstation. The malware was highly tailored to deenergize a transmission-level substation by opening and\nclosing circuit breakers and switchgear, devices responsible for balancing power across the electric system,\nand ensuring operator, power line, and equipment safety. The attack demonstrated a deep understanding of\nthe transmission environment and industrial protocols in use, enabling the adversary to customize malware for\nthe specific target.\n\nA recent Dragos report published in August describes ELECTRUM’s attempts to disrupt protective relays to\ncreate an unsafe, unstable condition for reconnected transmission lines at the moment of physical\nrestoration.[25] This suggests the attack could have caused much more significant – and dangerous –\nconsequences including equipment destruction, extended outages, and operator injury. Although the\nprotection-focused piece of the attack failed, it could act as a blueprint for future electric-targeting adversaries\nattempting to disrupt operations and cause the greatest possible damage.\n\n**ASSESSMENT**\n\nWhile this attack occured in Europe, the CRASHOVERRIDE framework would be trivial to modify in order to\nattack North American electric infrastructure. The intent to modify the framework has not been observed to\ndate. Additionally, Dragos’ research suggests concerning ambitions for ELECTRUM: causing a physicallydestructive event during restoration operations, a consequence not seen in previous attacks. North American\nelectric utilities should consider ELECTRUM to be a serious threat and be prepared to identify similar behaviors,\nincluding abuse of native functionality to and from ICS equipment.\n\n### Distribution\n\n**THREAT LANDSCAPE**\n\nIn the current threat landscape, one adversary group has disrupted electric distribution operations. The firstever blackout caused by a cyberattack took place in Ukraine on 23 December 2015. The attackers leveraged\nmalware to gain remote access to three electric power distribution companies, control distribution\n\n24 ESET originally identified CRASHOVERRIDE and named it Industroyer https://www.eset.com/int/industroyer/\n25 https://dragos.com/resource/crashoverride-reassessing-the-2016-ukraine-electric-power-event-as-a-protection-focused-attack/\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.

Lee, CEO of Dragos and one of the leads on the investigation of the 2015 cyberattack on Ukraine's\ndistribution electric system, attributed this attack to SANDWORM which was later confirmed by iSight.[27]\n\n**ASSESSMENT**\n\nAlthough adversaries have not disrupted electric distribution operations in North America, the behaviors and\ntool use exhibited by activity groups including SANDWORM and ELECTRUM could be deployed in electric\ndistribution facilities within North America. The adversary in the 2015 Ukraine electric sector attacks did not\nuse ICS-specific malware, rather controlled operations remotely via existing tools in the operations\nenvironment.\n\nDisrupting electric power through cyber means at any point throughout generation, transmission, and\ndistribution requires an adversary to have a fundamental understanding of the enterprise and operations\nenvironments, equipment used, and how to operate specialized equipment. Because an adversary must spend\na long time within the target environment learning the required skills to successfully disrupt electric power,\ndefenders have multiple points of opportunity along the potential attack chain to detect and eliminate adversary\naccess.\n\n## Regional Assessment[28]\n\n### North America\n\nSeven of 11 tracked activity groups target North American electric entities: PARISITE, XENOTIME, DYMALLOY,\nALLANITE, MAGNALLIUM, RASPITE, and COVELLITE.\n\nDragos identified a recent increase in activity targeting North American electric entities, led by the identification\nof PARISITE activity targeting known VPN vulnerabilities, and MAGNALLIUM password spraying campaigns[29]\nfocusing on oil and gas that expanded to include the electric sector. MAGNALLIUM’s increased activity\ncoincides with rising escalations between the US and allies, and Iran in the Middle East.[30] Dragos expects this\nactivity to continue.\n\nAdditionally, XENOTIME activity enabling potential supply chain compromise could affect entities in North\nAmerica. Compromising ICS hardware and software vendors poses a threat to all ICS entities regardless of\nregion due to global production and distribution.\n\n26 https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/\n27 https://ics.sans.org/media/E-ISAC_SANS_Ukraine_DUC_5.pdf\n28 Dragos does not perform attribution on threats. However, when other third-parties perform attribution, especially government entities, we document\nthis for others if it is of interest. It is our position that this style of attribution is not valuable from a network defense perspective and thus Dragos does\nnot spend resources on performing this action internally.\n29 https://www.wired.com/story/iran-apt33-industrial-control-systems/\n30 https://dragos.com/blog/industry-news/rising-cyber-escalation-between-us-iran-and-russia-ics-threats-and-response/\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.

But, major elections continue to play a significant role in cyber operations and this\nupcoming event cannot be ignored by any critical infrastructure sector.\n\nDragos continues to track phishing campaigns targeting North American electric utilities, with all activity\ngenerally focused on initial access operations. Since April 2019, over a dozen US-based electric utilities\nreceived spearphishing emails spoofing licensing and certification bodies with the intent to deliver LookBack\nmalware. The security firm Proofpoint first publicly reported this campaign.[33] Asset owners and operators\nshould ensure employees are trained to identify phishing attempts and report to security personnel when\nobserved.\n\n## 6 Concerning and Possible Attack Scenarios for North American Electric\n\n### 1. Destructive Event Causing Power Outage\n\nAs evidenced by the disruptive attacks on electric power in Ukraine, it is possible for adversaries to infiltrate\noperations environments and leverage a deep understanding of a target’s network to facilitate a potentially\ndisruptive or destructive attack. Dragos assesses adversaries interested in ICS are likely investing time and\nresources into developing ICS-specific capabilities.\n\nELECTRUM’s activities targeting transmission operations indicate an intent to cause physical destruction\nduring power restoration by attempting to disable protective relays.[34] If executed correctly, such an event\nwould cause a prolonged power outage, severely hamper restoration, and potentially cause physical harm\nto operators and equipment.\n\nA disruptive electric sector cyber event has not been observed in North America, however Dragos tracks\ngroups capable of establishing a foothold in operations environments which could lay the groundwork for\nfollow-on disruptive operations.\n\n31 https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/us/politics/trump-cyber-russia-grid.html\n32 https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/world/europe/russia-us-cyberwar-grid.html\n33 https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/lookback-forges-ahead-continued-targeting-united-states-utilities-sector-reveals\n34 https://dragos.com/resource/crashoverride-reassessing-the-2016-ukraine-electric-power-event-as-a-protection-focused-attack/\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc. All rights reserved. [Protected] Non-confidential content. January 8, 2020_\n\n\n_11_\n\n\n-----\n\n### 2. Third Party and Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Compromises\n\nVendors and third-party contractors are essential to enterprise and ICS operations. The numerous vendor\nor contractor touchpoints within generation, transmission, and distribution can provide an ingress into\nelectric utility environments via compromised or poorly-secured network connections.\n\nAdversaries are increasingly utilizing third-party compromise as a method for affecting intended targets.\nThis attack vector enables an adversary to utilize the implicit trust between companies, suppliers or\nsupporting entities. Dragos has observed multiple adversaries including XENOTIME, DYMALLOY, and\nALLANITE leveraging trusted relationships to infiltrate target networks. This includes compromising vendor\nnetworks as well as strategic web compromises. VPN appliances are used for remote connections to\noperations networks, and PARISITE, among other groups, is targeting these connections.\n\nAnother attack vector exploited by adversaries is through a managed service provider (MSP). MSPs will\ntypically be embedded within and maintain extensive remote access to client IT and OT networks. Thus, a\nbreach at an MSP can lead to direct access to multiple victim networks. The most extensive operation\npublicly disclosed was the series of intrusions into MSPs conducted by state-sponsored adversaries, linked\nin other resources to APT10, announced by the US-CERT in 2018.[35]\n\nAsset owners and operators in North America will need to address these supply chain risks with the\nmandatory implementation of CIP-013. Using threat information for CIP-013 implementation may benefit\nasset owners and operators in addressing impactful sector-specific concerns.\n\n### 3. Systematic Attack on Electricity Generation \n\nDue to the electric sector’s reliance on various energy resources, an attacker intent on disrupting electric\npower operations may target an entity along the supply chain required for producing electricity. For\ninstance, disrupting natural gas pipelines can affect electric generation and downstream natural gas\ndistribution, which has an amplifying effect to the response plans—especially considering the time of year\nor regional reliance on natural gas.\n\nThese can be referred to as a “systematic” attack on the inputs required for energy production along the\nelectric power supply chain. At this time, Dragos has not observed adversary activity relating to systematic\nattacks or the associated risk.\n\n### 4. OT Communications Gateways \n\nAs evidenced by a recent cyber event disrupting an electric utility’s OT communications, attackers can\nexploit vulnerabilities in the firewalls separating IT systems from OT to impact operations.\n\nA solar generation utility in the US experienced communications outages in March 2019 when an attacker\nexploited known firewall vulnerabilities to cause unexpected device reboots.[36] The incident caused\n\n35 https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-276B\n36 https://www.eenews.net/stories/1061421301\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc. All rights reserved. [Protected] Non-confidential content. January 8, 2020_\n\n\n_12_\n\n\n-----\n\nthe control center, according to a NERC report.[37] Dragos intelligence indicates the attacker targeted a known\nvulnerability in Cisco firewalls.\n\nWhile the impact was minimal, the activity did affect generation network connectivity for the utility. A longer\nlasting disruption, or more successful exploitation, could have lead to more severe consequences for the\nindividual utility if the adversary gained a foothold or cut communications completely.\n\n### 5. Adversary Access Through Cellular or Satellite Connections\n\nAs demonstrated by HEXANE activity, telecommunications networks are valuable targets for ICS-targeting\nattackers. Gaining access to a mobile or satellite network could allow an adversary to interact with power\ngeneration facilities that utilize cellular devices or satellite connections, including GPS, for communication,\nmonitoring, time-syncs, and management. Geographically dispersed and remote operations – such as\nremote substations – often depend on cellular or satellite communication networks. Cellular and satellite\nnetwork bridges into OT environments need to be closely monitored.\n\n### 6. Power Outages Provide Adversary Disruption Opportunities\n\nPlanned electric outages and maintenance windows can give adversaries insight into a utility’s operations\nand recovery procedures; timing of large-scale outages;[38] and knowledge that anomalous behavior may\nhave a higher likelihood of going undetected during such events.\n\nDuring initial equipment installation or maintenance windows it is normal for utilities to allow additional\nexternal entities into operational environments with USB keys, configuration files, laptops for engineers and\nvendors, etc. This is a prime opportunity to exploit and infect an OT network purposefully or incidentally. In\n2018 Schneider Electric alerted customers that USB sticks, shipped with two Conext products, may have\nbeen infected with unidentified malware during manufacturing by a supplier.[39] Although no customers\npublicly reported incidents of infection in this case, it demonstrates the possibility for attackers to leverage\nthird-party compromise to surreptitiously implant USB malware targeting electric entities. Such an event\npreviously occurred: in 2012, an electric utility experienced a malware infection on its control systems\nnetwork during planned upgrades, which was distributed accidentally via USB. This caused unexpected\ndowntime and delayed the plant restart for three weeks.[40] This type of attack would also bypass a\ncompanies security stack by being placed directly in the operations network.\n\nAs extreme weather events increasingly cause electric power companies to schedule mass power\noutages,[41] more opportunities arise for adversaries to infiltrate networks during times of scheduled\nblackouts. During planned outages, unusual activity may naturally occur on operations networks allowing\n\n37https://www.nerc.com/pa/rrm/ea/Lessons%20Learned%20Document%20Library/20190901_Risks_Posed_by_Firewall_Firmware_Vulnerabilities.pdf\n38 https://www.kron4.com/powershutoffs/pge-power-shutoffs-where-when-next-outages-are-scheduled/\n39 https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/SESN-2018-236-01/\n40 https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/Monitors/ICS-CERT_Monitor_Oct-Dec2012.pdf\n41 https://www.npr.org/2019/10/18/771486828/california-can-expect-blackouts-for-a-decade-says-pg-e-ceo\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.

Utilities\nare aware of physical impacts storms have, but fail to add cyber intrusions to any impact analysis,\ncontinuity of operations, or disaster recovery methodology. Taking down field devices in the middle of a\nhurricane is unlikely to cause much alarm and unlikely to be investigated past the usual physical causes.\nThis area is ripe for attackers to go unnoticed and cause lengthy downtimes without arousing suspicions.\n\n## Defensive Recommendations\n\nElectric sector asset owners and operators can implement the following host and network based\nrecommendations to improve the defensibility of their OT environments.\n\n  - CONSEQUENCE-DRIVEN Identify and prioritize critical assets (crown jewels) and connections, and\nprocess consequences of cyberattacks.[42] Perform threat assessments to scope the most impactful risk\nof disruptive or destructive attacks and use such data to shape threat hunting and defensive postures.\nWhile CIP-002 impacts over 1,500 utilities in North America and forces an impact-based discussion of\ncybersecurity and reliability, that is only from the Bulk Electric System perspective. It is recommended\nthat utilities perform their own consequence-driven analysis for improved security on assets and\nsystems that may impact their operations—and leverage a risk-based security approach outside of\nNERC CIP programs. Smaller utilities may not have in-scope facilities, yet could have impacts to their\nlocal communities (including distribution assets, where there are no NERC CIP requirements).\n\n  - THIRD-PARTIES Ensure that third-party connections and ICS interactions are monitored and logged,\nfrom a “Trust, but Verify” mindset. Where possible, isolate or create DMZs for such access to ensure\nthat third-party access does not result in complete, unfettered, or unmonitored access to the entire ICS\nnetwork. Implement features such as jump hosts, bastion hosts, and secure remote authentication\nschema wherever possible. In-scope systems for the upcoming CIP-013 implementation should\nleverage an enterprise-wide supply chain risk management program, where appropriate. Dragos\nrecommends using threat information and consequence-driven analysis to address supply chain cyber\nrisk.\n\n  - RESPONSE PLANS Develop, review, and practice cyberattack response plans and integrate cyber\ninvestigations into root-cause analysis for all events. Especially consider intelligent adversaries which\nmay also attack plans during remediation and response to increase disruption scale and downtime.\nWhere required, consider leveraging CIP-008 and CIP-009 exercises to review the controls and across\nthe entire utility security program to provide additional resilience to utility operations.\n\n  - ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT Expanding on the requirements from CIP-007, which applies system security\nmanagement controls for in-scope BES Cyber Systems, ensure all devices and services do not use\n\n42 https://dragos.com/resource/dependency-modeling-for-identifying-cybersecurity-crown-jewels-in-an-ics-environment/\n\n\nACCOUNT MANAGEMENT\n\n\nRESPONSE PLANS\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.

Restrict access to devices to only necessary personnel. Implement\nthe principle of least privilege across all applications, services, and devices to ensure individuals are\nonly able to access the resources needed to perform their duties. This includes ensuring applicationlayer services including file shares and cloud storage services are properly segmented. Following the\nPurdue Model, network connections should be terminated before continuing to different levels.\n\n  - ACCESS RESTRICTIONS Restrict administrative access within a domain, limit the number of domain\nadministrators, and separate networking, server, workstation, and database administrators into\nseparate organizational units (OUs). Identity is key in defense.\n\n  - SEGMENTATION Where possible, segment and isolate networks to limit lateral movement. This can be\ndone most easily with a firewall or access control list (ACL) for companies to virtually segment networks\nand reduce attack surface while limiting adversary mobility. While CIP-005 provides requirements on\ncreating an Electronic Security Perimeter for in-scope BES Cyber Systems, a similar approach may be\nuseful for smaller utilities and other facilities. Additional guidance from NERC on leveraging firewalls\nhas been released that can be applied regardless of NERC CIP requirements.[43]\n\n  - VISIBILITY A comprehensive approach for visibility into ICS/OT environments should be taken to ensure\nthat there is no gap in monitoring. Asset owners and operators and security personnel should work\ntogether to gather network and host-based logs starting from the most critical infrastructure, also\nknown as “crown jewels.” The ability to identify and correlate suspicious network, host, and process\nevents can greatly assist in either identifying intrusions as they occur, or facilitate root-cause analysis\nafter a disruptive event. Ensure network monitoring of the operations network through ICS-focused\ntechnologies.\n\n  - ACCESSIBILITY Identify and categorize ingress and egress routes into control system networks. This\nincludes engineer and administrator remote access portals, but also covers items such as business\nintelligence and licensing server links that need to access IT resources or the wider internet. Limit these\ntypes of connections, via firewall rules or other methods, to ensure a minimized attack surface. This\napproach compliments the requirements of CIP-005, and Dragos recommends considering where to\nplace similar controls outside of NERC CIP compliance programs.\n\n  - PUBLIC DATA Assess asset owner hosted, publicly posted information and data that could allow\nsensitive information to be utilized by an adversary. Work with vendors, contractors, and other to\nminimize or prevent identification of specific sites, capabilities, or equipment in marketing and related\nmaterials. Some data, like regulatory filings, may require working with legal counsel to manage—or at\nleast monitor.\n\n  - CONFIGURATION Identify and store “known good” configuration information for ICS devices in nonnetwork accessible locations to provide baselines for comparison as well as restore points in the event\nof disruption. Update these items frequently to ensure such storage mirrors production environments.\nThis action not only assists recovery in the event of IT malware propagating into ICS networks, but also\n\n43 _See NERC Control Systems Security Working Group guideline titled “Control System Electronic Connectivity.” This guideline provides a number of_\nexamples with variants on the four-legged firewall model. This guideline is not intended to be specific to CIP compliance; rather it is focused on good\nsecurity practices.\n\n\nACCESS RESTRICTIONS\n\n\nSEGMENTATION\n\n\nPUBLIC DATA\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.

January 8, 2020_\n\n\nCONFIGURATION\n\n\nVISIBILITY\n\n\n_15_\n\n\n-----\n\nCIP-010 provides additional context for this approach for in-scope BES Cyber Systems.\n\n  - THREAT INTELLIGENCE Use and operationalize ICS-specific threat intelligence. Threat intelligence can\nenable identification of known threat behaviors. Electric power entities should understand the behaviors\nand capabilities of activity groups targeting other industrial verticals, such as oil and gas, as these\nadversaries actively shift and expand targeting to include additional energy sectors. The Dragos\nPlatform incorporates intelligence-driven threat behavior analytics,[44] automating identification of\nknown attacker behaviors. Dragos WorldView Threat Intelligence provides up-to-date intelligence\nfeeds, reports, analysis, and defensive recommendations for new and ongoing threats to oil and gas.\nThe NERC CIP Reliability Standards do not address threat management, which is a mature—but\nnecessary—practice for any security program.\n\n  - DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH Design and implement defense-in-depth surrounding ICS networks where security\ncontrols and enhanced visibility are applied to hosts capable of handling such tasks. Examples include\nrequiring remote access to flow through a jump-host featuring enhanced Windows and network logging\nto ensure adequate monitoring of remote access to the control system network. OT cybersecurity\nrequires a strategy specific to the vertical and cannot be a simple extension of the enterprise\nimplementation.\n\n  - NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE ALLANITE and DYMALLOY regularly target routers and switches during\ncompromises, changing configurations to allow for persistent access or delivery of additional malware.\nImplement router, switch, and firewall configuration baselines and a configuration management\nprogram to ensure adversaries do not tamper with configurations and exploit security gaps.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe North American electric sector cyber threat landscape is diverse and active. Activity groups have\ndemonstrated capabilities that could impact operations and network connectivity across operational\nenvironments. Electric utilities remain at risk for a disruptive – and potentially destructive – cyberattack due\nto the political and economic impact such an event may cause.\n\nAlthough North America has not experienced a disruptive cyberattack to electric system operations and\nreliability, ICS-targeting adversaries previously demonstrated the capability to disrupt electricity in Europe.\nWith additional resources and retooling, such disruptive methods could potentially be applicable to the North\nAmerican electric system.\n\nAt this time, Dragos has observed adversary activity targeting utility enterprise networks which may enable\nintial intrusion and reconnaissance at those entity sites. The data gathered and access achieved could facilitate\npreliminary steps for a potentially disruptive event within the OT environment. Dragos has also observed\nadversary reconnaissance inside ICS networks.\n\n44 https://dragos.com/blog/industry-news/threat-analytics-and-activity-groups/\n\n\nNETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n\nDEFENSE-IN-DEPTH\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.

The aforementioned weaponized USB, software updates and maintenance work will also clear\nmost security barriers as the OEMs, maintenance engineers and MSPs are seen as trustworthy and non-hostile.\nNERC Registered Entities with in-scope systems can take advantage of the recent focus around CIP-013 to\ncreate robust supply chain risk management programs focused on both security and compliance objectives\nacross operations.\n\nA disruptive attack would require significant effort to achieve in North America, and as an adversary must spend\nsignificant time within compromised networks to learn operations (i.e. dwell time) this provides defenders with\nnumerous opportunities to identify and remove malicious activity prior to disruption.
