During April and May\n2020, a new Grandoreiro variant was identified. This piece of malware includes\nimprovements in the way it is operating. The threat has been disseminating via malscam\ncampaigns, as in the past, and the name of the victim is used as a part of the malicious\nattachment name, as shown below.\n\nThe attached file is an HTML document that downloads the Grandoreiro’s 1st stage – a\nVBScript file (VBS). After that, an ISO file is downloaded from the online server, according to\nthe target country and campaign. During this investigation, several samples were found\n\n\n-----\n\nonline, specifically grouped by campaigns and countries (see Technical Analysis).\n\nThe malware modus operandi is very similar to old samples, however, this new variant brings\nsome improvements to how it is communicating with the C2 server. After analyzing it,\nsimilarities with latenbot-C2 traffic were identified and described below (another Brazilian\ntrojan).\n\nGrandoreiro operators probably are including Latenbot botnet modules as a way of improving\ncommunication between C2 and infected hosts – creating a kind of Grandoreiro botnet.\n\nThe malware is capable of collecting banking details from victims’ devices, get total control of\nthe OS, reboot, and lockdown, windows overlay, keylogger capabilities, and performing\nbrowser interaction.\n\nFor more details about this threat see the Technical Analysis below.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nThe Grandoreiro malware has been distributed via malscan campaigns around the globe\nduring Q2 2020. As can be observed during this publication, new features have been added\n[to the new samples, including latenbot-C2 features (another Brazilian trojan – see](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/06/latentbot/)\n_[@hasherezade analysis](https://twitter.com/hasherezade)_ _[here), and the scope of malware was now extended to Portuguese](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/06/latentbot/)_\nbanks.\n\n**_Figure 1: Grandoreiro email template Q2 2020 (Portugal).

One of the last analyzed samples (2020-05-21 –\n_8491a619dc6e182437bd4482d6e97e3a) is scrutinized below._\n\n## Grandoreiro VBS file – First stage (Portugal May 2020)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Filename: Torrentz5B88BC75AD1DA330A74FFA2ED717DB0B3AE71CCC.vbs**\n**MD5: 8491a619dc6e182437bd4482d6e97e3a**\n**SHA1: 46d601a56103bf0a623d1c937eab41d8772de644**\n\nAt first glance, the VBS file seems obfuscated, nonetheless, some details can be extracted\nsuch as the encoded string with the URL where the next stage is downloaded and the place\nwhere it will be executed on the target machine.\n\n**_Figure 4: Grandoreiro VBS file (1st stage) obfuscated. Some details can be extracted from_**\n_the code how highlighted above._\n\nThe following piece of code can be used to decode the strings hardcoded in the VBS file.\n\nThe decoded string is a URL pointing to a website where several samples of Grandoreiro are\navailable. The samples are downloaded depending on the initial stage and the target country.\nThe following URL was distributed in Portugal during April and May 2020 and described in\nthis investigation.\n```\nEncoded string: cipher=\"bnnj4))+3,(,-0(+.1(+**4+3/*)Cho`nolcifm(cmi\"\n-Decoded string: http://192.236.147.]100:1950/Inufturiols.iso\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe Grandoreiro samples available on this server online were often changed by criminals as\na way of bypassing AV’s detections. Based on metrics from May 20th, 1771 users were\n**potentially infected or executed the Grandoreiro 1st stage (VBS file).**\n\n**_Figure 5: Metrics collected from the Grandoreiro server on May 20th, 2020. Each sample is_**\n_associated with different ongoing campaigns and target countries._\n\nIn detail, the sample distributed in Portugal was downloaded 224 times (Inufturiols.iso in\nFigure 5). The sample was available for download between 2020-05-18 and 2020-05-22.\n\nAn interesting point is that one day after data collection, on 2020/05/21, most of the samples\nwere removed from the server by the malware operators, but the sample targeting Portugal\nwas kept available for the next days.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 6: Metrics collected from the server on May 21st, 2020 with the Portuguese sample_**\n_kept by crooks._\n\nThe threats available on the server are the same, but different samples were created by\nGrandoreiro operators as observed below. The samples were grouped by countries or\ncampaigns.\n\n**_Figure 7: Grandoreiro samples (ISO files) available on the server online._**\n\nThe ISO files have a size range of 4MB to 7MB which is an unusual file size for image files.\nTheses files are an archive file that contains all the information that would be written to an\noptical disc. The malware is inside them and is dropped when the file is executed. This is not\nnew, several threats have been distributed via ISO files past months (see more details in a\n[ThreatPost publication here).](https://threatpost.com/malspam-emails-blanket-lokibot-nanocore-malware-with-iso-files/145991/)\n\n\n-----\n\nDigging into the details, when the VBS file (1st stage) is executed on the victim s machine,\nthe ISO file is downloaded from the server online.\n\n**_Figure 8: ISO file downloaded from the server online and stored on the IE web cache._**\n\nNext, the folder “ \\nvreadmm ” is created on the AppData\\Roaming directory, and the zip\nfile with the malware inside is dropped (the zip filename can be observed in Figure 4 above).\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 9: Zip file with the malware inside is dropped into the_**\n_“AppData\\Roaming\\nvreadmm” folder._\n\nWhen the download is done, the unzip process starts. The PE file (Grandoreiro trojan\nmalware) is extracted into the same folder and executed.\n\n**_Figure 10: Grandoreiro extracting process ~ binary with a size of 331 MB._**\n\n## Grandoreiro – Final Payload (Portugal May 2020)\n\n**Filename: Inufturiols.exe**\n\n**MD5: 1f861de0794cd020072150db618da154**\n\n**SHA1: c3f70025857ac7eca467412d35f17fc5ec10f659**\n\nThe final payload is a PE file written in Delphi – a Latin American banking trojan. According\nto [ESET, “Grandoreiro has been active at least since 2017 targeting Brazil and Peru,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/04/28/grandoreiro-how-engorged-can-exe-get/)\n**_expanding to Mexico and Spain in 2019. “_**\n\nThe malware scope was extended also to Portugal now, with several Portuguese banks\nincluded in the malware operations as highlighted below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure

set of capabilities:\n\n**manipulating windows**\n**updating itself**\n**capturing keystrokes**\n**simulating mouse and keyboard actions**\n**navigating the victim’s browser to a chosen URL**\n**logging the victim out or restarting the machine**\n**blocking access to chosen websites**\n\nIn detail, the malware performs its tasks according to the OS installed on the infected device\n( label 1 – Figure 12 ). Several Windows OS target versions can be found inside the\nmalware, namely:\n\n**Windows 10 Home**\n**Windows 8**\n**Windows 10**\n**Windows Server**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 12: Grandoreiro blocks of code executed during the infection process. All the_**\n_highlighted labels are described below._\n\n\n-----\n\n**Label 2 shows a call that examines the affected device and creates a folder inside**\n**\\AppData\\Roaming where new modules can be downloaded into and also some data about**\nthe target bank portal can be temporarily stored.\n\n**_Figure 13: The malware uses some in-memory paths that will be created when the target_**\n_banking portal and victims’ details are collected._\n\n**Label 3 in Figure 12 shows when the process of collecting details and browser overlay is**\ninitiated. “DetonarProcesso” Portuguese word can be translated to: “Trigger process”, in\nEnglish. The malware starts here its process of collecting details about the banking portal\nwhen the victim accesses a target banking website.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, label 4 and label 5 are the calls responsible for creating the overlay window\nthat will be presented on the victims’ screen.\n\nFinally, label 6 shows that the overlay windows is presented based on the target banking\norganization.\n\nDuring its execution, Grandoreiro collects some details about the infected device:\n\n**computer name and username**\n**operating system; and**\n**list of installed security products.**\n```\nSELECT * FROM AntiVirusProduct\n\n```\nInteresting that the malware is not executed when two computer names are found. They\nprobably are the computer names from Grandoreiro operators/developers. This is can be\nseen as a potential kill switch.\n\n**_Figure 14: Computer names hardcoded inside the malware._**\n\n## Grandoreiro capabilities and Latenbot-C2 features\n\n\n-----\n\nGrandoreiro is a piece of malware that has evolved over time. It has capabilities to interact\nwith the infected machine, receiving commands from C2, and executes them inside the\nmachine as a simple botnet.\n\nAs described by ESET on older variants; and confirmed during this analysis; the malware is\ncapable of:\n\n**manipulating windows**\n**updating itself**\n**capturing keystrokes**\n**simulating mouse and keyboard actions**\n**navigating the victim’s browser to a chosen URL**\n**logging the victim out or restarting the machine; and**\n**blocking access to chosen websites**\n\n**_Figure 14: Grandoreiro internal commands (left side) and browser management (right side)._**\n\nThe malware persistence is achieved via a registry key on Windows\\CurrentVersion:\n```\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\nValue: C:\\Users\\root\\AppData\\Roaming\\nvreadmm\\Inufturiols.exe\n\n```\nAn interesting detail in this variant is the C2 communication. The C2 IP address can be\nidentified below, where also the name “DANILO” is visible.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 15: Grandoreiro C2 IP address._**\n\nInside the malware and based on the web traffic analysis, it’s possible to see similarities with\n[latenbot C2-traffic (as presented here).](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/06/latentbot/)\n\n**_Figure 16: Latenbot (2017) and Grandoreiro (2020) C2-traffic similarities._**\n\nGrandoreiro operators probably are including Latenbot botnet modules as a way of\n**improving communication between C2 and infected hosts – the creation of a kind of**\n**Grandoreiro botnet.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 17: Grandoreiro C2-traffic._**\n\n## Grandoreiro PE file padding\n\nAs observed in ESET analysis, “the vast majority of Grandoreiro samples utilize a very\n_interesting application of the binary padding technique. This technique is all about making_\n_the binaries large and we have seen it being used even by more sophisticated malware. We_\n_have also observed some other Latin American banking trojans employing it occasionally,_\n_but only in the simplest form of appending a large amount of junk at the end of the binary._\n\n_Grandoreiro chooses a different approach – a simple, yet very effective one. The resources_\n_section of the PE file is augmented by (usually 3) grande BMP images, making each binary_\n_at least 300 MB in size.”_\n\nThe samples analyzed in May 2020 that target Portuguese users used the technique\npreviously described.\n\nFigure 18 below shows that the resources directory is big and populates part of the binary\nsize.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 18: PortEx padding analysis – Grandoreiro May 2020._**\n\nThree BMP images were specially created by Grandoreiro operators as a way of enlarging\nthe size of binary file. Notice that the PE file size is 331 MB and 322 MB are only populated\nby three BMP resources (the technique used by malware operators in past samples).\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 19: BMP resources used by Grandoreiro malware to increase file size and to bypass_**\n_AV’s detection._\n\n## Spam tool\n\nDuring May 2020 was observed that many phishing emails targeting Portuguese users were\ndisseminated via a spam tool called: Leaf PHPMailer 2.8. Crooks compromise several\nservers and are using tools like this to sent malicious emails to a large group of users.\n\nBelow is presented a screenshot from a compromised server we analyzed during this\ninvestigation.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 20: Spam tool used by Grandoreiro operators to disseminate malscam campaigns in-_**\n_the-wild in Portugal._\n\nFinally, the malware server online with the ISO files, spam tool, and C2 were\ndecommissioned at the moment of writing this publication.\n\n## Mitre Att&ck Matrix\n\n Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n vbs file (1st stage)\nvbs: Torrentz5B88BC75AD1DA330A74FFA2ED717DB0B3AE71CCC.vbs\nMD5: 8491a619dc6e182437bd4482d6e97e3a\n-- 2nd stage ISO file -http://192.]236.147.100:1950/Inufturiols.iso\n-- Final payload -Filename: Inufturiols.exe\nMD5: 1f861de0794cd020072150db618da154\nSHA1: c3f70025857ac7eca467412d35f17fc5ec10f659\n-- C2-web-traffic-104.168.190.]164\nhttp://104.]168.190.164:9050/$rdgate?ID=B3030080574A43BE857DBE13C21D7110\nhttp://104.]168.190.164:9050/$rdgate?ACTION=HELLO\nhttp://104.]168.190.164:9050/$rdgate?ACTION=START&ID=B3030080574A43BE857DBE13C21D7110\n\n### IOCs – 2020/05/28\n\n```\n[#grandoreiro](https://twitter.com/hashtag/grandoreiro?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#trojan](https://twitter.com/hashtag/trojan?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n-loader VBS🐞| delivered in �\n\n-new server-📩-2nd-stage ✅\n\n[152.67.44.]175:5661 a (São Paulo)@OracleCloud – Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64](https://twitter.com/OracleCloud?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n(name:INSTANCE-202005)\n\nThreat ℹ [https://t.co/sxMPRDeNYH@malwrhunterteam](https://t.co/sxMPRDeNYH) [@JAMESWT_MHT](https://twitter.com/JAMESWT_MHT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[@cocaman](https://twitter.com/cocaman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@HunterPhish](https://twitter.com/HunterPhish?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/GX97FrQgwZ](https://t.co/GX97FrQgwZ)\n\n[— Pedro Tavares (@sirpedrotavares) May 28, 2020](https://twitter.com/sirpedrotavares/status/1266015816761389057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## Sandbox online\n\n[https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/232895/0/html](https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/232895/0/html)\n\n## References\n\n[https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/06/latentbot/](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/06/latentbot/)\nhttps://threatpost.com/malspam-emails-blanket-lokibot-nanocore-malware-with-isofiles/145991\n[https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/04/28/grandoreiro-how-engorged-can-exe-get](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/04/28/grandoreiro-how-engorged-can-exe-get/)\n\n[Pedro Tavares](https://seguranca-informatica.pt/author/pipocaz/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Pedro Tavares is a professional in the field of information security working as an Ethical](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sirpedrotavares/)**\nHacker/Pentester, Malware Researcher and also a Security Evangelist.
