    "plain_text": "# PLAYing the game\n\n**orangecyberdefense.com/global/blog/playing-the-game**\n\n# Data in this article\n\n[More insights](https://www.orangecyberdefense.com/global/blog/playing-the-game#c54146)\n\nIn our recently published Security Navigator report we highlight the fact that ransomware\noperations involving data encryption have been increasingly coupled with extortion tactics\nfrom threat actors to further pressure victim organizations into paying ransoms. This is what\nwe term cyber-extortion (Cy-X). This trend is key when looking at the current threat\nlandscape. Indeed, most of the currently active ransomware operations perform doubleextortion (or even triple-extortion), for instance threatening to leak stolen information on the\nDark Web or to sell it to the highest bidder if the ransom is not paid or launching DDoS\nattacks against the same victim.\n\nExtortion in itself has thus arisen to a point where encryption is not always necessary: it is\nequally lucrative to hack and leak an organization. This shift in cybercrime operations\npartially results from the overall improvement by organizations of their backup strategies in\norder to better prevent ransomware attacks, leading some threat actors to now only perform\nthis type of operations. This is for instance the case of groups such as Karakurt,\nRansomHouse or Silent Ransom…\n\n\n-----\n\nDouble extortion is all the more problematic as leaked information can facilitate further\ncompromises from other threat groups. These leaks feed the ongoing data trade within\nunderground marketplaces and cybercriminal forums.\n\nUntil the fundamental systemic factors that enable this form of crimes are addressed, we\nshould expect to see criminals continuing to adapt and test new pressure tactics to rush\nvictims into paying exorbitant ransoms. We continue to see Cy-X groups come and go,\nprimarily because of how lucrative these extortion operations appear to be, along with their\napparent ease of execution and supposed anonymity. Even if law enforcement agencies\nsometimes succeed in identifying and arresting members of these clusters, this often leads\nto groups disbanding, rebranding and updating their tactics to further avoid detection.\n\nThis leads us nicely to a new ransomware group known as PLAY, which leverages double\nextortion through its own leak site.\n\nWe first notified customers of the threat presented by PLAY in a CERT ‘World Watch’\nadvisory published in early September 2022\n[(https://portal.cert.orangecyberdefense.com/worldwatch/570462 for registered users).](https://portal.cert.orangecyberdefense.com/worldwatch/570462)\n\n[“Trend Micro researchers detailed in a recent report a new ransomware, which adds](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/i/play-ransomware-s-attack-playbook-unmasks-it-as-another-hive-aff.html)\nthe .play extension after encrypting files and drops a ransom note containing only the\nword \"PLAY\" along with an email address to contact the group. The first reports of this\nransomware's activity date from June 2022, when a victim asked for help in the\n[Bleeping Computer forums. In July, Trend Micro researchers investigated a large](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/773651/play-ransomware-play-support-topic/)\nnumber of attacks in quick succession in the Latin American region targeting\ngovernment entities.\n\nFor initial access, the threat actor has been known to use compromised valid accounts\n[or exploit unpatched Fortinet SSL VPN vulnerabilities. The ransomware group uses](https://portal.cert.orangecyberdefense.com/worldwatch/511706)\nliving-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) as part of its attacks, such as WinSCP for data\nexfiltration and Task Manager for LSASS dumping. They use double extortion\ntechniques, compressing the victim's files with WinRAR and uploading it to file sharing\nsites. The ransomware is then distributed via GPO and run using scheduled tasks,\nPsExec or wmic….”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat cluster behind PLAY is yet to be extensively covered by security researchers.\nTrend Micro was the first vendor to publicly document this threat actor in a report[1] published\nin September 2022, where they provided analysis following investigations into attacks carried\nout in July. Based on their analysis they believed that PLAY was the successor of Hive, a\nnotorious ransomware active since 2021. It also shares some overlaps with Nokoyawa, yet\nanother ransomware operation. However, there is nothing concrete that allows us to assess\nwith high confidence whether PLAY is definitely a successor of one of these two ransomware\nfamilies.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn early September, security researcher Chuong Dong also published a technical analysis of\nthe ransomware being used by PLAY, focusing mostly on its anti-analysis and encryption\nfeatures. In his blog post[2] he states that PLAY is heavily obfuscated with a lot of unique\ntricks that have not been used by any other ransomware.\n\nOne of the first victim was the French ITS Group, who disclosed the breach via their website:\n\nSince November 2022, our CERT started investigating a surge in PLAY compromises.\n\nRecently our friends at CrowdStrike reported the exploit dubbed OWASSRF while\ninvestigating Play ransomware attacks, where compromised Microsoft Exchange servers\nwere used to infiltrate the victims' networks. OWASSRF is a chaining of CVE-2022-41080\nand CVE-2022-41082. PLAY has also been reported to exploit ‘ProxyNotShell’ (CVE-202241040), but CrowdStrike found that the flaw abused by a newly discovered exploit is likely\n[CVE-2022-41080, a security flaw that allows remote privilege escalation on Exchange](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-41080)\n\n[1]\n\nservers which Microsoft tagged as critical but not exploited in the wild when patching it last\nNovember.\n\n**We searched for these three vulnerabilities in a significantly sized sample of our**\n**Vulnerability Scanning clients and only found occurrences at 2.5% of the clients we**\n**examined. Only CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082 were found together at the same**\nclient, and we found that occurence only once.\n\nThis of course does not reduce the significance of these vulnerabilities, which are clearly\nbeing exploited in the wild, but it is encouraging to see that they are apparently being\nsuccessfully fixed by most of our client base.\n\nIn a recent, common practice amongst other Cy-X groups, PLAY ransomware recently\npublished a website, accessible only through Tor, where the group is disclosing details about\nvictims and leaking stolen data if the victim doesn't pay the ransom. The ransom note left by\n\n\n-----\n\nPLAY used to be very blunt and specific to the victim with only an email address to contact\nthe threat group. Usually though, ransomware operators take the time to explain to the victim\nhow to acquire the requested cryptocurrency and threaten retaliation if they contact recovery\ncompanies or law enforcement. This guidance is nevertheless being provided by PLAY in the\nFAQ section of this newly published data leak site. The group behind PLAY are also following\na recent trend among ransomware operators whereby they apply additional pressure on\nvictims during negotiations by initially obfuscating the victim's name on the leak site, thus\ngiving them an opportunity to pay in order to prevent their full name from being released\npublicly.\n\nThe ‘added’ date on the leak below is deceiving, because PLAY actually carried out this\ncompromise before the launch of their site. The compromise likely dated back to September.\n\n[1]\n\nwww.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-uses-new-microsoft-exchangeexploit-to-breach-servers/\n\nUnsurprisingly, our Computer Incident Responses Teams (CSIRT) has encountered this\nthreat group in three different cases in the last month.\n\nWe held a call with one infected customer at 09h00 the morning after their systems were\nencrypted in November. Investigations commenced immediately and by 12h20 our team was\nprocessing evidence.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe customer in question is not a large business. The initial point of entry appeared to be\nVPN access using legitimate credentials, and the ransomware deployment and encryption\nhad taken place over the course of just one day. On some machines malware was deployed\nand triggered manually via RDP, on others it was via PSExec. Almost the entire environment\nwas encrypted. Onsite backups were either encrypted or destroyed. Fortunately for this\nvictim, a set off reliable off-site backups allowed us to recover most of the data and systems.\nUnfortunately for this victim, several hundred gigabytes of data were published on the PLAY\ndata leak site.\n\nOur CSIRT worked over a period of 8 days to assist and proceed to identify, track and\ncontain the compromise. A malware sample that proved to be PLAY was discovered early\non, and forwarded to our CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) to identify the strain\nand capabilities of the code, using the sandbox described below.\n\nOur experience across these cases leads us to suspect that we are dealing with a separate\nPLAY affiliate, perhaps specializing in Europe. The IoC and TTPs identified in all three cases\noverlap considerably, and in two other cases in France we’re aware of (but didn’t work on\ndirectly) we believe the sample of the remote access tool ‘systemBC’ recovered was\nidentical. Yet none of the intelligence we collected from the three cases we’ve worked on so\nfar overlaps with intelligence we’ve received from third parties working on cases elsewhere.\n\nSome of this infrastructure is still active and located in Europe, so some IoCs can be share\nonly once French or European law enforcement have been involved properly. Some are\nnevertheless provided at the end of this report.\n\nThe first step for our Reverse Engineers was to determine the malware family, easily\nobtainable with the .play encrypted extension.\n\nThe suspicious executable found on the system was detonated in our proprietary ‘P2A’\nSandbox to discover the attributes and behaviors of the file. We confirmed the family thanks\nto a custom ‘YARA’ rule stemming from our World Watch advisory and automatically\nembedded in P2A. This rule can be used to search for PLAY files elsewhere in ‘live’\nenvironments. As a reminder, [YARA is an open-source tool designed to help malware](http://virustotal.github.io/yara/)\nresearchers identify and classify malware samples. It makes it possible to create descriptions\n(or rules) for malware families based on textual and/or binary patterns.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur SaaS file analysis sandbox, P2A, can be used to easily confirm whether suspicious files\nbelong to one malware family. Fortunately, our sandbox allows for any analysis to be shared\npublicly, so you can view this output directly here:\n[p2a.cert.orangecyberdefense.com/analysis/111551/publicshared/HMD8BYOHA7AEXAYL](https://p2a.cert.orangecyberdefense.com/analysis/111551/publicshared/HMD8BYOHA7AEXAYL)\n\nThe YARA rule we created then triggered an alert on VirusTotal’s ‘LiveHunt’ service\n(https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001315437-Livehunt#h_b063a6e6-6de54aea-ab55-9d8ea46fbeb0). Livehunt allows you to hook into the stream of files analyzed by\nVirusTotal and get notified whenever one of them matches a certain rule written in the YARA\nlanguage. By applying YARA rules to the files analyzed by VirusTotal we are able to get a\nconstant flow of malware samples of this family, including ones not detected by antivirus\nengines. The match against our rule from LiveHunt confirmed our initial assessment that we\nwere dealing with PLAY.\n\nwww.virustotal.com/gui/file/5e94626c6bcb825acede3826811ed693644d6dbb7caeeefb8575c\n2ec711a65a6/detection\n\n\n-----\n\nManual reverse engineering of the sample started on November 22 . The process proved to\nbe challenging and required a full two-days of effort from an experienced engineer, who was\nable to confirm that the obfuscation techniques observed those described in the analysis by\nChuong Dong we mentioned above:\n\n[https://chuongdong.com/reverse%20engineering/2022/09/03/PLAYRansomware/](https://chuongdong.com/reverse%20engineering/2022/09/03/PLAYRansomware/)\n\nSamples of the malware incorporate an obfuscation technique known as \"Return Oriented\nProgramming\" (ROP) and garbage code insertion to make analysis more difficult. Other\ntechniques used by PLAY ransomware include string obfuscation and import hashing using\nthe xxhash32 algorithm. It is highly likely that these obfuscation techniques have been\nrecently added to the malware but the code itself remains the same.\n\nFollowing on from the three cases our CSIRT is engaged in, our Threat Intelligence teams\nwill soon publish an update of our World Watch advisory outlining PLAY’s recent activity.\n\nFurthermore, our CERT has also now made publicly available a subset of the PLAY\nransomware IoCs contained in our Datalake Threat Intelligence database[3] (available as a\nSaaS service named Managed Threat Intelligence-detect). As with our P2A sandbox, we are\nable to share outputs from our database directly with our community, and made these IoCs\navailable for you here (updated once per day only):\n\n[datalake.cert.orangecyberdefense.com/api/v2/mrti/public/export-html/](https://datalake.cert.orangecyberdefense.com/api/v2/mrti/public/export-html/?query_body_hash=3fdd244f6a6de3d9586c63bf073068b1)\n\n\n-----\n\nThese IoCs are used automatically by our Managed Threat Detection services. You can add\nthem also in your security detection solutions (SIEM, NDR, EDR, etc.), in order to alert your\nSOC team. Orange Cyberdefense can orchestrate for you the automatic feeding of such\nnetwork-related IOCs in your security protection equipments (i.e. in various NGFW) using our\n\"Managed Threat Intelligence - protect\" service.\n\n\n-----",
