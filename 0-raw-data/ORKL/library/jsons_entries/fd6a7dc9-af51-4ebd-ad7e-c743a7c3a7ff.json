BlackBerry ThreatVector Blog](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en.html)\n2. Threat Thursday: Arkei Infostealer Expands Reach Using SmokeLoader to Target Crypto Wallets and MFA\n\n### Summary\n\nThe criminal group behind the Arkei information stealer appears to be interested in more than just picking our pockets.\nWhile cryptocurrency remains a primary target for the malware, which has recently been tied to use of the stealthy\n[SmokeLoader downloader, a new analysis of Arkei shows that it has now expanded its reach to collect multifactor (MFA)](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2018/07/threat-spotlight-resurgent-smoke-loader-malware-dissected)\nauthentication data as well.\n\nIt’s not currently clear what attackers are looking to do with this information, but a threat group that is specifically targeting\nthis information has the capacity to impact people using MFA both at home and at work.\n\nArkei also downloads a variety of legitimate components, which are often hosted via compromised websites, and puts\nthem to use for malicious purposes. Much of Arkei’s flexibility relies on its configuration file, often hosted alongside these\nlegitimate components, to receive its marching orders. Depending on what is enabled in this file, the malware will perform\ndifferent activities, such as stealing saved password details, raiding auto-complete forms, and purloining saved credit card\ndetails and browser cookies.\n\n### Operating System\n\n\n-----\n\n### Risk & Impact\n\n Technical Analysis\n\n**Attack Vector**\n\n[Like many modern information-stealer families such as RedLine, Arkei is often sold and distributed as Malware-as-a-](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/07/threat-thursday-redline-infostealer)\nService (MaaS), which means its initial attack vector can vary. However, over the past few weeks, this threat has been\n[spotted utilizing the notorious downloader SmokeLoader as a method of deployment. Both Arkei and SmokeLoader have](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2018/07/cylance-vs-smoke-loader-and-the-trickbot-trojan)\nbeen identified using the same Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and known-malicious URLs to conduct their malicious\nfunctionality.\n\nInformation-stealers and banking Trojans commonly use malware downloaders like SmokeLoader to get onto a victim\ndevice. Often, these types of malware rely on phishing websites or Trojanized download pages for hosting, offering\nseemingly benign software – cracked paid-applications or other potentially-trojanized downloads – to entice people to\naccept their poisoned offerings.\n\n**Components**\n\nOn execution, Arkei will attempt to make several HTTP web-requests to a malicious URL. These GET HTTP Requests\nare designed to download known-legitimate components that the malware will then use to achieve some of its malicious\nfunctionality.\n\nOnce downloaded, Arkei will typically store the following Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) into the %\\ProgramData\\%\ndirectory for use throughout its execution process.\n\n**Name** **Description**\n\nsqlite3.dll SQLite Database Management DLL\n\nfreebl3.dll Freebl Network Security Service Library for Mozilla\n\nmozglue.dll Browser Library for Mozilla\n\nnss3.dll Network System Service Library for Mozilla Firefox\n\nsoftokn3.dll Part of the Network Security Services for Mozilla\n\nmsvcp140.dll Constituent file for Visual C++ for Visual Studio 2015\n\n\n-----\n\nvcruntime140.dll Runtime library for Visual Studio (Visual C++)\n\n**Configuration**\n\nOnce Arkei has obtained its components, it will make one final GET Request to the same malicious URL to obtain its\nconfiguration file, as shown in Figure 1. This file is a small Base64-encoded .PHP file.\n\nArkei interprets the data within this configuration file and, depending on which flags are enabled within it, will carry out\ndifferent malicious activities. This strategy makes the malware extremely flexible, as it allows the threat actor to extend\nthe threat’s capabilities, or to focus on specific information to steal. For example, depending on which items in the\nconfiguration file are enabled, it determines which applications to automatically exfiltrate data from.\n\n_Figure 1: Request for Arkei's configuration_\n\nUsing the [CyberChef tool, the data contained within the config file can be de-obfuscated, as shown in Figure 2.](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)\n\n_Figure 2: CyberChef output of Arkei config_\n\n**Anti-Emulation and Region Checks**\n\nArkei will check both the region of the device and the computer name. If the malware is executed with the computer name\n“HAL9TH,” it will terminate its execution chain. This computer name check is done because it is the name given to the\nWindows Defender Emulator; this technique is used by malware to prevent itself from running in an emulated\nenvironment.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware will also exit if it finds it s being run in one of the following regions:\n\nRussian (Russia)\nUzbek (Latin, Uzbekistan)\nAzerbaijani (Cyrillic, Azerbaijan)\nKazakh (Kazakhstan)\nBelarusian (Belarus)\n\n**Browser Targets**\n\nOne of the first pieces of information Arkei will attempt to steal is information about the victim’s Internet browser. Arkei\nsearches for the presence of many popular browsers, including Google Chrome™ and Firefox, before attempting to\nscrape various pieces of data from them to exfiltrate.\n\nThe following applications are typically targeted:\n\n**Targeted Browsers**\n\nGoogle Chrome Chromium Microsoft Edge\n\nKometa Amigo Torch\n\nOrbitum Comodo Dragon Nichrome\n\nMaxthon5 Sputnik Epic Privacy Browsers NEW\n\nVivaldi CocCoc Uran\n\nQIP Surf CentBrowser Elements\n\nTorBro CryptoTab Brave\n\nOpera OperaGX OperaNeon\n\nFireFox SlimBrowser PaleMoon\n\nWaterfox Cyberfox BlackHawk\n\nIceCat KMeleon Thunderbird\n\n**Grabber**\n\nArkei has an internal function labelled “Grabber,” which finds valuable information stored in Internet browsers. Because\ninformation is stored differently in each browser, Arkei has specific locations of a victim device where it looks for data to\nsteal.\n\nIf enabled via the configuration file, Arkei will initially attempt to store different types of information in text files with the\nfollowing file names.\n\n**Name** **Description**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cookies.txt** Browser cookies\n\n**Autofill.txt** Auto-filled stored information\n\n**History.txt** Internet browser history\n\n**CC.txt** Stored credit card details\n\n**Downloads.txt** Internet download paths\n\n**Passwords.txt** Stored passwords\n\n**Browser Extensions**\n\nOne of most notable functions of Arkei is its ability to steal data from Google Chrome browser extensions. For each\nChrome-based extension, an “Extension ID” is given. The malware uses this information to harvest data stored within.\n\nThis Extension ID is often stored within the following folders:\n\n%AppData%\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Local Extension Settings\n%AppData%\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Sync Extension Settings\n%AppData%\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\IndexedDB\\Domain Name.indexeddb.leveldb\n\nArkei will attempt to harvest any files located within the extension folder. For cryptocurrency holders, this malware poses\na significant threat due to the large number of wallets and crypto services it targets.\n\nHowever, Arkei is not solely focused on stealing cryptocurrency. Arkei appears to also target additional Chrome-based\nbrowser extensions related to two-factor and multifactor authentication (2FA/MFA) and password management,\nincreasing its risk to both corporate and private environments. It’s not entirely clear what attackers seek to do with this\ninformation; they could be seeking to change the device used to verify 2FA access (such as someone’s cell phone) to one\ncontrolled by attackers.\n\n**Browser Extension List – Passwords and Authentication**\n\n**Extension Type** **Extension Name** **Extension ID**\n\nPassword Manager Trezor Imjoifkgjagghnncjkhggdhalmcnfklk\n\n2FA Phantom bfnaelmomeimhlpmgjnjophhkkoljpa\n\n2FA Authenticator 2FA bhghomapcdpbohigoooaddinpkbai\n\n2FA Authy 2FA Gaedmjdfmmahhbjefcbgaolhhanlaolb\n\n2FA EOS Authenticator oeljdldpnmdbchonielidgobddffflal\n\n2FA GAuth Authenticator Ilgcnhelpchnceeipipkaljkblbcpbl\n\n**Browser Extension List – Cryptocurrency Wallets**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Extension**\n**Name**\n\n\n**Extension ID** **Extension Name** **Extension ID**\n\n\n**TronLink** ibnejdfjmmkpcnlpebklmnkoeoihofec **Auro Wallet** cnmamaachppnkjgnildpdmkaakejnhae\n\n**MetaMask** nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn **Polymesh Wallet** jojhfeoedkpkglbfimdfabpdfjaoolaf\n\n\n**Binance Chain**\n**Wallet**\n\n\nfhbohimaelbohpjbbldcngcnapndodjp **ICONex** flpiciilemghbmfalicajoolhkkenfel\n\n\n**Yoroi** ffnbelfdoeiohenkjibnmadjiehjhajb **Nabox Wallet** nknhiehlklippafakaeklbeglecifhad\n\n**Nifty Wallet** jbdaocneiiinmjbjlgalhcelgbejmnid **KHC** hcflpincpppdclinealmandijcmnkbgn\n\n**Math Wallet** afbcbjpbpfadlkmhmclhkeeodmamcflc **Temple** ookjlbkiijinhpmnjffcofjonbfbgaoc\n\n\n**Coinbase**\n**Wallet**\n\n\nhnfanknocfeofbddgcijnmhnfnkdnaad **TezBox** mnfifefkajgofkcjkemidiaecocnkjeh\n\n\n**Guarda** hpglfhgfnhbgpjdenjgmdgoeiappafln **Cyano Wallet** dkdedlpgdmmkkfjabffeganieamfklkm\n\n**EQUA Wallet** blnieiiffboillknjnepogjhkgnoapac **Byone** nlgbhdfgdhgbiamfdfmbikcdghidoadd\n\n**Jaxx Liberty** cjelfplplebdjjenllpjcblmjkfcffne **OneKey** infeboajgfhgbjpjbeppbkgnabfdkdaf\n\n**BitApp Wallet** fihkakfobkmkjojpchpfgcmhfjnmnfpi **LeafWallet** cihmoadaighcejopammfbmddcmdekcje\n\n**iWallet** kncchdigobghenbbaddojjnnaogfppfj **DAppPlay** lodccjjbdhfakaekdiahmedfbieldgik\n\n**Wombat** amkmjjmmflddogmhpjloimipbofnfjih **BitClip** ijmpgkjfkbfhoebgogflfebnmejmfbml\n\n**MEW CX** nlbmnnijcnlegkjjpcfjclmcfggfefdm **Steem Keychain** lkcjlnjfpbikmcmbachjpdbijejflpcm\n\n**GuildWallet** nanjmdknhkinifnkgdcggcfnhdaammmj **Nash Extension** onofpnbbkehpmmoabgpcpmigafmmnjhl\n\n**Saturn Wallet** nkddgncdjgjfcddamfgcmfnlhccnimig **Hycon Lite Client** bcopgchhojmggmffilplmbdicgaihlkp\n\n**Ronin Wallet** fnjhmkhhmkbjkkabndcnnogagogbneec **ZilPay** klnaejjgbibmhlephnhpmaofohgkpgkd\n\n**NeoLine** cphhlgmgameodnhkjdmkpanlelnlohao **Coin98 Wallet** aeachknmefphepccionboohckonoeemg\n\n**Clover Wallet** nhnkbkgjikgcigadomkphalanndcapjk **Terra Station** aiifbnbfobpmeekipheeijimdpnlpgpp\n\n**Liquality Wallet** kpfopkelmapcoipemfendmdcghnegimn **Keplr** dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap\n\n**Sollet** fhmfendgdocmcbmfikdcogofphimnkno\n\n\n-----\n\n**Crypto Wallets**\n\nArkei does not just stop at targeting crypto currencies via browser extensions. Many people prefer not to use third-party\n[applications and services to store their digital currency. So, like the BlackJack component of BHunt we discussed in last](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/02/threat-thursday-bhunt-scavenger)\nweek’s _[Threat Thursday blog, Arkei performs a similar routine to look for specific crypto wallets stored locally on the](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/author/the-blackberry-research-and-intelligence-team)_\nvictim’s device.\n\nArkei will sweep through various folders looking for specific files related to cryptocurrency. This threat will search specific\nfolders for terms like “wallet.dat,” which is a file-name format used by a wide range of different currencies. If a match is\nfound, the malware attempts to store the content of the file in a SQL database, which it will exfiltrate back to its commandand-control (C2) server.\n\nThough Arkei has the ability to target a wide range of crypto wallets, observed samples have had dedicated functionality\nto target the following crypto wallets:\n\n**Crypto Wallets**\n\nExodus Atomic Bitcoin\n\nBinance JAXX ElectrumLTC\n\nEthereum MultiDoge Coinomi\n\nElectron Cash\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\nOnce Arkei has finished ransacking the victim’s computer, it will attempt to bundle all the data it has obtained and\nexfiltrate it back to its C2. It collects this information in a folder with a name that is typically comprised of 12 random\nletters and numbers [0-9A-Z], as shown in Figure 3.\n\nAs Arkei obtains data, it will catalog that information before sending it back to the C2. As part of this catalog, the malware\nwill also take a screenshot of the victim device and gather system information into a file called “system.txt.”\n\n_Figure 3: Example of Arkei exfiltration file_\n\n**System Information**\n\nThe system.txt file contains the following information about the victim’s device:\n\n**System Info**\n\n\n-----\n\nIP Address Display Resolution\n\nCountry PC Name\n\nWorking Path Username\n\nDisplay Language Domain Name\n\nKeyboard Language MachineID\n\nIs Laptop GUID\n\nProcessor OS\n\nInstalled RAM Video card\n\nArkei will also append a list of all installed software to this text file before exfiltrating the data. The data from Arkei is then\nsent to a new C2 and exfiltrated to the URL it initially reached out to.\n\nOnce Arkei has completed this step and exfiltration is successful, it will kill the process and delete itself. This is done as a\nclean-up mechanism to remove the malware from the device and prevent the victim from discovering they have been\ntargeted.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nArkei is a flexible and stealthy information stealer that can impact both personal and corporate devices. As a MaaS, it\nbundles together several desirable features for attackers to use, allowing them to change infection tactics to suit their\nneeds.\n\nInclusion of a configuration file allows threat actors to tailor exactly what information they choose to steal from the victim.\nAnd using legitimate files to perform nefarious functions makes Arkei more difficult for legacy anti-malware products to\ndetect.\n\nAs more people both use cryptocurrencies and work from home, it is becoming more common to store personal financial\ninformation, as well as corporate data, on personal devices. This makes information-stealing an extremely rewarding\npursuit for threat actors, who will continue pushing boundaries in their attempts to pursue bigger financial rewards.\n\n**Who is Typically Affected?**\n\nCommercial and Professional Services\nConsumer Durables and Apparel\nTelecommunication Services\nPublic Sector\nInsurance\n\n**Mitigation Tips**\n\nAvoid downloading cracked software, or software from unknown/unverified links.\nMake sure corporate login credentials and personal passwords are not saved in your browser.\nUse two-factor authentication on a separate device, such as an authentication application installed on a mobile\nphone or tablet.\n\n### YARA Rule\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following YARA rule was authored by the BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team to catch the
