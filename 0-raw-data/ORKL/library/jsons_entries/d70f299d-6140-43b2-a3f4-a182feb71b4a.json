In this post we will show how the trail continues and\nallows us to identify a second APT3 member, Mr Dong.\n\n**From httb to biglit**\n\nDNS research on httb[.]net reveals a second IP address: 61.129.67[.]53. Three other\ninteresting domains have previously resolved to it. They are vcersoft[.]com, uyre[.]net and\ninc-work[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\nHistoric DNS resolutions showing a vcersoft domain pointing to 61.129.67[.]53Note also the\ninclusion of ciscocorp[.]com in the list above – it is one of the domains associated with the\nwyz5678[at]163.net address associated with Wu Yingzhuo.\nLooking at the three newly identified domains, WHOIS information for all three includes a\nnew e-mail address, biglit[at]gmail.com.\n\nHistoric WHOIS data for vcersoft[.]com includes biglit[at]gmail.comFrom biglit to tianyu\nThe biglit e-mail address appeared in registration information for a number of other domains,\nincluding microsoft-ie[.]com. Historic WHOIS information for this domain includes the e-mail\naddress tianyu12[at]msn.com.\n\n**And back to biglit**\n\nIn addition to the microsoft-ie[.]com domain, the tianyu12 e-mail address also appeared in\nregistration data for unixfocus[.]net. But tianyu12 was not the only e-mail address that\nappears in historic registration data for the domain. A previous address was biglit[at]163.net,\nsimilar to the biglit g-mail address mentioned earlier.\n\n\n-----\n\nHistoric WHOIS for unixfocus[.]net shows biglit[at]163.netDong Hao\nCompleting the chain, the new biglit address appeared in the WHOIS information for another\nnew domain: shuyan[.]com. And the name that appeared in the shuyan registration record\nwas … Dong Hao.\n\n\n-----\n\nHistoric WHOIS data for shuyan[.]com shows biglit[at]163.netSo, from the httb[.]net\n**domain identified in our last post and registered by Wu Yingzhuo, we have followed a**\n**chain through a server in Shanghai, vcersoft[.]com, microsoft-ie[.]com and**\n**unixfocus[.]net to find Dong Hao, a second APT3 operator involved in registering**\n**domain names.**\nBut who are Wu Yingzhuo and Dong Hao? We will reveal soon exactly where they work, and\nfrom whom they receive their orders. Read our next post for more truth behind this intrusion.\n\n\n-----",
