It has attracted very little public attention,\n[with the exception of an advisory from the Belarusian CERT in February 2020. In the interim, the group has](https://cert.by/?p=1458)\ncompromised many government agencies and private companies in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis blogpost is a summary, with updated information about the compromise vectors and Indicators of\n[Compromise, of research that we’ve presented at the Virus Bulletin 2020 conference (see the full paper](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-Faou-Labelle.pdf)\n[and the presentation).](https://vblocalhost.com/presentations/xdspy-stealing-government-secrets-since-2011/)\n\n## Targets\n\nTargets of the XDSpy group are located in Eastern Europe and the Balkans and are primarily government\nentities, including militaries and Ministries of Foreign Affairs, and private companies. Figure 1 shows the\nlocation of known victims according to ESET telemetry.\n\n_Figure 1. Map of XDSpy victims according to ESET telemetry (Belarus, Moldova, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine)_\n\n## Attribution\n\nAfter careful research, we were not able to link XDSpy to any publicly known APT group:\n\nWe did not find any code similarity with other malware families.\nWe did not observe any overlap in the network infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe are not aware of another APT group targeting these specific countries and verticals.\n\nMoreover, the group has been active for more than nine years. So, had such an overlap existed, we believe\nthat it would have been noticed, and the group uncovered, a long time ago.\n\nWe believe that the developers might be working in the UTC+2 or UTC+3 time zone, which is also the time\nzone of most of the targets. We also noticed they were only working from Monday to Friday, suggesting a\nprofessional activity.\n\n## Compromise vectors\n\nXDSpy operators mainly seem to use spearphishing emails in order to compromise their targets. In fact,\nthis is the only compromise vector that we have observed. However, the emails tend to vary a bit: some\ncontain an attachment while others contain a link to a malicious file. The first layer of the malicious file or\nattachment is generally a ZIP or RAR archive.\n\nFigure 2 is an example of an XDSpy spearphishing email sent in February 2020.\n\n_Figure 2. Spearphishing email sent by XDSpy’s operators in February 2020_\n\nRoughly translated, the body of the email says:\n\n_Good afternoon!_\n\n_I am sending you a copy of the letter and photo materials based on the results of the work. Click on the link_\n_to download: photo materials_11.02.2020.zip_\n\n_We are waiting for an answer until the end of the working day._\n\nThe link points to a ZIP archive that contains an LNK file, without any decoy document. When the victim\ndouble-clicks on it, the LNK downloads an additional script that installs XDDown, the main malware\ncomponent.\n\nAfter our paper was submitted to Virus Bulletin, we continued to track the group and, after a pause\nbetween March and June 2020, they came back. At the end of June 2020, the operators stepped up their\ngame by using a vulnerability in Internet Explorer, CVE-2020-0968, which had been patched in April 2020.\nInstead of delivering an archive with a LNK file, the C&C server was delivering an RTF file that, once\nopened, downloaded an HTML file exploiting the aforementioned vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2020-0968 is part of a set of similar vulnerabilities in the IE legacy JavaScript engine disclosed in the\nlast two years. At the time it was exploited by XDSpy, no proof-of-concept and very little information about\nthis specific vulnerability was available online. We think that XDSpy either bought this exploit from a broker\nor developed a 1-day exploit themselves by looking at previous exploits for inspiration.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is interesting to note that this exploit bears similarities with exploits previously used in DarkHotel\n[campaigns, as shown in Figure 3. It is also almost identical to the exploit used in Operation Domino in](https://ti.dbappsecurity.com.cn/blog/index.php/2020/09/18/operation-domino/)\nSeptember 2020, which was uploaded to VirusTotal from Belarus.\n\nGiven that we don’t believe XDSpy is linked to DarkHotel and that Operation Domino looks quite different\nfrom XDSpy, it is likely that the three groups share the same exploit broker.\n\n_Figure 3. Parts of the exploit code, including the beginning, are similar to that used in a DarkHotel campaign_\n\n_described by JPCERT_\n\nFinally, the group jumped on the COVID-19 wagon at least twice in 2020. It first used this theme in a\nspearphishing campaign against Belarusian institutions in February 2020. Then, in September 2020, they\nreused this theme against Russian-speaking targets. The archive contained a malicious Windows Script\nFile (WSF) that downloads XDDown, as shown in Figure 4, and they used official website\nrospotrebnadzor.ru as a decoy, as shown in Figure 5.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Part of the script that downloads XDDown_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Part of the script that opens the decoy URL_\n\n## Malware components\n\nFigure 4 shows the malware architecture in a scenario where the compromise happens through a LNK file,\nas was the case in February 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. XDSpy’s malware architecture. XDLoc and XDPass are dropped in no particular order_\n\nXDDown is the main malware component and is strictly a downloader. It persists on the system using the\ntraditional Run key. It downloads additional plugins from the hardcoded C&C server using the HTTP\nprotocol. The HTTP replies contain PE binaries encrypted with a hardcoded two-byte XOR key.\n\nDuring our research, we discovered the following plugins:\n\nXDRecon: Gathers basic information about the victim machine (the computer name, the current\nusername and the Volume Serial Number of the main drive).\nXDList: Crawls the C: drive for interesting files (.accdb, .doc, .docm, .docx, .mdb, .xls, .xlm, .xlsx,\n.xlsm, .odt, .ost, .ppt, .pptm, .ppsm, .pptx, .sldm, .pst, .msg, .pdf, .eml, .wab) and exfiltrates the paths\nof these files. It can also take screenshots.\nXDMonitor: Similar to XDList. It also monitors removable drives to exfiltrate the files matching an\ninteresting extension.\nXDUpload: Exfiltrates a hardcoded list of files from the filesystem to the C&C server, as shown in\nFigure 5. The paths were sent to the C&C servers by XDList and XDMonitor.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Loop uploading a hardcoded list of files to the C&C server (partially redacted)_\n\nXDLoc: Gathers nearby SSIDs (such as Wi-Fi access points), probably in order to geo-locate the\nvictim machines.\nXDPass: Grabs saved passwords from various applications such as web browsers and email\nprograms.\n\n[More details about the various malware components can be found in the white paper.](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-Faou-Labelle.pdf)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nXDSpy is a cyberespionage group mostly undetected for more than nine years while being very busy over\nthe past few months. It is mostly interested in stealing documents from government entities in Eastern\nEurope and the Balkans. This targeting is quite unusual and makes it an interesting group to follow.\n\nThe group’s technical proficiency tends to vary a bit. It has used the same basic malware architecture for\nnine years, but it also recently exploited a vulnerability patched by the vendor but for which no public proofof-concept exists, a so-called 1-day exploit.\n\n\n-----\n\n_For any inquiries, or to make sample submissions related to the subject, contact us at_\n_[threatintel@eset.com.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:threatintel@eset.com)_\n\n_Special thanks to Francis Labelle for his work on this investigation._\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nThe comprehensive list of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and samples can be found in our GitHub\nrepository.\n\n### Malware components\n\n**SHA-1** **ESET detection name** **Description**\n\nC125A05CC87EA45BB5D5D07D62946DAEE1160F73 JS/TrojanDropper.Agent.OAZ Spearphishing\nemail (2015)\n\n99729AC323FC8A812FA2C8BE9AE82DF0F9B502CA LNK/TrojanDownloader.Agent.YJ Malicious LNK\ndownloader\n\n63B988D0869C6A099C7A57AAFEA612A90E30C10F Win64/Agent.VB XDDown\n\nBB7A10F816D6FFFECB297D0BAE3BC2C0F2F2FFC6 Win32/Agent.ABQB XDDown\n(oldest known\nsample)\n\n844A3854F67F4F524992BCD90F8752404DF1DA11 Win64/Spy.Agent.CC XDRecon\n\nB333043B47ABE49156195CC66C97B9F488E83442 Win64/Spy.Agent.CC XDUpload\n\n83EF84052AD9E7954ECE216A1479ABA9D403C36D Win64/Spy.Agent.CC XDUpload\n\n88410D6EB663FBA2FD2826083A3999C3D3BD07C9 Win32/Agent.ABYL XDLoc\n\nCFD43C7A993EC2F203B17A9E6B8B392E9A296243 Win32/PSW.Agent.OJS XDPass\n\n3B8445AA70D01DEA553A7B198A767798F52BB68A DOC/Abnormal.V Malicious RTF\nfile that\ndownloads\nthe CVE2020-0968\nexploit\n\nAE34BEDBD39DA813E094E974A9E181A686D66069 Win64/Agent.ACG XDDown\n\n5FE5EE492DE157AA745F3DE7AE8AA095E0AFB994 VBS/TrojanDropper.Agent.OLJ Malicious\nscript (Sep\n2020)\n\nB807756E9CD7D131BD42C2F681878C7855063FE2 Win64/Agent.AEJ XDDown\n(most recent\nas of writing)\n\n### Filenames / Paths\n\n\n-----\n\n%APPDATA%\\Temp.NET\\archset.dat\n%APPDATA%\\Temp.NET\\hdir.dat\n%APPDATA%\\Temp.NET\\list.dat\n%TEMP%\\tmp%YEAR%%MONTH%%DAY%_%TICK_COUNT%.s\n%TEMP%\\fl637136486220077590.data\nwgl.dat\nWindows Broker Manager.dat\n%TEMP%\\Usermode COM Manager.dat\n%TEMP%\\Usermode COM Manager.exe\n%APPDATA%\\WINinit\\WINlogon.exe\n%APPDATA%\\msprotectexp\\mswinexp.exe\n%APPDATA%\\msvdemo\\msbrowsmc.exe\n%APPDATA%\\Explorer\\msdmcm6.exe\n%APPDATA%\\Explorer\\browsms.exe\n\n### Network\n\n**Used in 2019-2020**\n\ndownloadsprimary[.]com\n\nfiledownload[.]email\n\nfile-download[.]org\n\nminisnowhair[.]com\n\ndownload-365[.]com\n\n365downloading.com\n\nofficeupdtcentr[.]com\n\ndropsklad[.]com\n\ngetthatupdate[.]com\n\nboborux[.]com\n\neasytosay[.]org\n\ndaftsync[.]com\n\ndocumentsklad[.]com\n\nwildboarcontest[.]com\n\nnomatterwhat[.]info\n\nmaiwegwurst[.]com\n\nmigration-info[.]com\n\njerseygameengine[.]com\n\nseatwowave[.]com\n\ncracratutu[.]com\n\nchtcc[.]net\n\nferrariframework[.]com\n\n**Old network infrastructure**\n\n62.213.213[.]170\n\n93.63.198[.]40\n\n95.215.60[.]53\n\nforgeron[.]tk\n\njahre999[.]tk\n\nomgtech.000space[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\npodzim[.]tk\nporfavor876[.]tk\nreplacerc.000space[.]com\nsettimana987[.]tk\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n\n_[Note: This table was built using version 7 of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/)_\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n\nInitial\nAccess\n\n\n[T1566.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/) Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment XDSpy has sent\nspearphishing emails with a\nmalicious attachment.\n\n\n[T1566.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002/) Phishing:\nSpearphishing\nLink\n\n\nXDSpy has sent spearphishing emails\nwith a link to a malicious archive.\n\n\nExecution [T1203](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203/) Exploitation for Client Execution XDSpy has exploited a\nvulnerability (CVE-20200968) in Internet Explorer\n(triggered by a malicious RTF\nfile).\n\n\n[T1204.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001/) User\nExecution:\nMalicious Link\n\n[T1204.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/) User\nExecution:\nMalicious File\n\n\nXDSpy has lured targets to download\nmalicious archives containing malicious\nfiles such as LNK.\n\nXDSpy has lured targets to execute\nmalicious files such as LNK or RTF.\n\n\nPersistence [T1547.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/) Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:\nRegistry Run Keys / Startup Folder\n\n\nXDDownload persists using\nthe Run key.\n\n\nDiscovery [T1033](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033/) System Owner/User Discovery XDRecon sends the\nusername to the C&C server.\n\n\n[T1082](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/) System\nInformation\nDiscovery\n\n[T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/) File and\nDirectory\nDiscovery\n\n\nXDRecon sends the computer name and\nthe main drive Volume Serial Number to\nthe C&C server.\n\nXDList and XDMonitor monitor the local\nsystem and the removable drive.
