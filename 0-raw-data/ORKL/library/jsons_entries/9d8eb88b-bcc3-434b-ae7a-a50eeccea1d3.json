These investigations took place during mid-to-late 2017, and each bank compromise resulted in a\nsignificant amount of stolen funds. The actual amount of money stolen was different in each case, with the average\namount around USD$5 million (in cash), ranging from USD$3 to USD$10 million. The investigations showed that\nthe attacks shared a number of common features, such as involving large amount of monetary loss originating from\nwhat initially appeared to be legitimate bank customer accounts. Additionally, in all cases, the theft took place using\nnormal cash withdrawals from various ATM terminal locations outside the bank’s originating country.\n\nIn some cases, the victim banks didn’t even realize that a breach had taken place and a significant amount of money\nwas stolen until well after the attack was completed. In a few cases, the malicious activity was reported to the banks\nby third-party processors responsible for processing the bank’s debit and credit card transactions. The common\nfeature between these cases is that money was stolen using legitimate ATM cards provided by each bank.\n\nCriminals used (or hired) people to personally visit the various branches and request new accounts with minimum or\nzero initial deposit amounts. Beyond opening their “personal’ accounts, they also demanded to receive a debit card\nwith their new account. Initially this might not appear to be an issue since debit card usage is directly related to the\naccount’s balance. However, in the banking world, a service called “Overdraft” exists; simply put it means that under\nvery specific circumstances a debit card can be converted into a credit card. This means that the bank allows their\ncustomer to withdraw cash even though they do not have the appropriate balance in their account. Of course, this is\nsupposed to happen only for specific account types, also referred to as risk levels.\n\nAfter the debit cards were delivered to the customers, they were distributed outside the originating country to a\ngroup of international conspirators. When all the cards had been relocated to their destination countries, a cybercriminal, who had already breached the victim bank network, accessed the bank’s internal systems and manipulated\nthe debit cards’ features to enable a high overdraft level and removed anti-fraud controls that had been placed for\nthe specific accounts. Minutes later the operation continued in the countries where the debit cards had travelled.\nThe debit cards were used to perform cash withdrawals from several different ATMs. Within the next few hours the\noperation concluded, removing up to USD$10 million from each bank.\n\nWe believe that the attack described in this report represents a clear and imminent threat to financial institutions in\nEuropean, North American, Asian and Australian regions within the next year. Currently the attacks are localized to\nthe Eastern European and Russian regions. However, in cybercrime, this area is often the canary in the mineshaft\nfor upcoming threats to other parts of the world. Our investigations have revealed victim losses currently around\napproximately USD$40 million. However, when taking into account the undiscovered or uninvestigated attacks\nalong with investigations undertaken by internal groups or third parties, we estimate losses to be in the hundreds of\nmillions in USD. All global financial institutions should consider this threat seriously and take steps to mitigate it.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Post Soviet Bank Heists: A Hybrid Cybercrime Study\n\n##### A Closer Look\n\nTo drill into the details of these criminal operations we will take a closer look at one of the cases. On a winter evening\nin February 2017, a credit/debit card processor’s fraud management system picked up a series of suspicious ATM\nwithdrawal transactions originating from the victim bank’s customer accounts during the late-night hours until the\nearly morning. The withdrawals occurred at ATM terminals located across the region, including Europe and the\nRussian Federation. Notably, no ATM transactions occurred in countries where the affected bank had a presence.\n\nIn addition to requesting the Trustwave SpiderLabs team to perform a thorough investigation, the bank also reported\nthis incident to local law enforcement agencies. Undoubtedly this incident appeared to be multifaceted; it appeared\nthat the bank’s network was breached, and it also seemed likely that the processor’s network may have also been\ncompromised. Moreover, it was also likely that there was a physical facet to this breach, in which an organized\ncybercriminal network was involved. The Trustwave team’s objective was to investigate the incident based purely on\navailable factual evidence and its unbiased interpretation.\n\nThe third-party processor engaged an independent team from Trustwave SpiderLabs to investigate the impact\nof the incident on its network and its overall business. This way Trustwave could see the whole picture from the\nperspectives of both the affected bank and the third-party processor, whose services the bank used for its card\nprocessing functions.\n\nThe Trustwave team commenced both sides of the investigation immediately and was able to successfully uncover\nwhat we believe to be a very interesting, if not entirely unique, modus operandi behind the successful breaches of\nboth the bank and processor networks. The objective of such an operation is the successful withdrawal of funds\nfrom the rogue accounts created earlier, as described in this report.\n\nThe attackers used innovative attack tactics, techniques and procedures to successfully execute a long duration\n“hybrid” attack campaign comprising two physical stages and multiple cyber-attack stages as depicted below:\n\n###### STAGES OF THE ATTACK\n\n\n**Physical Stage I**\n\nRecruit mules to\nopen bank\naccounts and issue\nnew debit cards\n\n\n**Cyber Stage I**\nObtain unauthorized\nprivigeged access to\nthe bank’s network\n\n\n**Cyber Stage II**\nCompromise third\nparty processor’s\nnetwork\n\n\n**Cyber Stage III**\n\nObtain privileged\naccess to Card\nManagement System\n\n\n**Cyber Stage IV**\n\nActivate overdraft\non specific bank\naccounts\n\n\n**Physical Stage I**\nCash-out from ATMs\nin multiple cities\nand countries\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Post Soviet Bank Heists: A Hybrid Cybercrime Study\n\n##### Detailed Walkthrough\n\nOur findings suggest that motivation for the attack was purely financial gain. Our analysis shows that the cyber\nattackers and their physical counterparts worked in close and very effective coordination to execute this malicious\noperation:\n\n**•** The cybercriminal network behind this attack recruited so-called “mules”, (non-technical conspirators whose\n\njob is to transfer money for cybercriminals), to open dozens of new bank accounts by physically visiting various\nbranches of this bank in different cities in the country. These individuals used counterfeit documents to request\nbank accounts, most likely supplied by the organized cybercriminal network. Once these people had new bank\naccounts approved, they then requested debit/ATM card companions to their new bank accounts. After they\nobtained these debit cards, they probably handed these debit cards over to a member of the cybercriminal\nnetwork for distribution outside the country for later use.\n\n###### PHYSICAL PART OF THE ATTACK\n\n\nRecruit mules to\napply for new\nbank accounts\n\n\nSupply mules Rogue accounts Request Debit cards Debit cards\nwith fake IDs are created debit cards are issued sent outside\nthe country\n\n\n\n**•** While the physical activities involving application for accounts and debit cards were taking place at the bank’s\n\nvarious branches in the country, the cyber attackers gained initial entry, moved laterally and compromised\nmultiple systems inside the bank’s network.\n\n###### GAINING INITIAL FOOTHOLD IN THE BANK NETWORK\n\n\n**Opportunistic**\n**Phishing**\nEmails to employees\nwith malicious\nattachments opened –\n‘backdoor’ is\ncreated\n\n\n**Social**\n**Engineering**\nAttackers successfully\nobtain ‘backdoor’\naccess through\ncompromised\ncomputers\n\n\n**Exploit Windows**\n**Computers**\nSet up multiple\n‘backdoors’ and\nRDP access to\ncompromised\nsystems\n\n\n\n**•** After successfully compromising the bank’s network the cyber attackers then proceeded to launch an attack on\n\nthe third-party processor’s network and eventually (after numerous attempts) they succeeded. The bank, due\nto their established cooperation with the processor, already maintained connectivity with the processor. This\nmade it easier for the criminals because they had already gained access to the bank’s infrastructure and had\ncaptured the credentials used to connect to the processor. After gaining foothold into the processor’s network,\nthe attackers compromised the Enterprise Admin account which eventually gave them full access into the\ninfrastructure. Their next step was to execute reconnaissance of the card processing service.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Post Soviet Bank Heists: A Hybrid Cybercrime Study\n\n LATERAL MOVEMENT AND SUCCESSFUL COMPROMISE OF BANK NETWORK\n\n\n**Leverage Control**\n**Weakness in**\n**Windows Network**\n\n\n**Launch Lateral**\n**Movement**\n**Attack**\n\n\n**Obtain the**\n**“Keys to the Kingdom”**\n\n\n**Compromise**\n**Bank Network**\n\n\n\n**•** Next, the attackers executed several malicious payloads on the processor’s network, key amongst them was\n\na legitimate monitoring tool installed on the processor’s Terminal Server (that allowed users to access the card\nmanagement application via a browser). This software called “Mipko” (advertised as “Employee Monitor”)\ncaptures full information, including screen captures, keystrokes and several other types of information for all\nusers who logged into the system and/or accessed the card management application using their respective\ncredentials. In this way the software attackers captured almost 4GB of data within a month. The information\ncaptured included keystroke logging and countless screenshots.\n\n###### INSTALLATION OF KEYLOGGER AND COMPROMISE OF THE PROCESSOR NETWORK\n\n\n**Choose Staging Point** **Connect to** **Install Keylogger**\n**on Bank Network** **Processor Network** **on Network**\n\n\n**Compromise**\n**Processor Network**\n\n\n\n**•** The attackers then identified the accounts on the card management application used by the bank employees\n\nwho had authorization to “request” changes to the properties of a customer’s debit card, and “approve” or\n“commit” such a change. They were looking for such privileges to manipulate each of the cards associated with\nthe rogue accounts created during the preceding months.\n\n**•** During the day of the final stage attackers used these credentials to:\n\n  - Change risk ratings on the rogue accounts from high to low allowing the attackers to activate further credit\n\npermission, known as Overdraft (or simply OD).\n\n  - Activate the OD credit function on the accounts.\n\n  - Manipulate or remove any anti-fraud control in place for these accounts.\n\n - Change the OD Limit on the accounts from the default value of USD$0 to ranges of USD$25,000 - USD$35,000.\n\n\n**Choose Privileged**\n**User Account**\n**in CMS**\n\n\n**Raise Request to**\n**Change Debit Card**\n**Properties**\n\n\n**Finalize Changes**\n**to Debit Card**\n**Properties**\n\n\n\n**•** The physical counterparts stationed at various locations in Europe and the Russian Federation then cashed out\n\nsubstantial amounts of money for each of these cards from ATM terminals. Cash withdrawals across the region\nbegan within minutes of the first OD property change made to the debit cards on the card management application.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Post Soviet Bank Heists: A Hybrid Cybercrime Study\n\n COORDINATED ATM CASH WITHDRAWALS ~ MILLIONS OF USD\n\n\n**Command &**\n**Control with**\n**Physical Mules**\n**for Coordinated**\n**Cash Outs**\n\n\n**Coordinated** **Direct $ Value of Loss:**\n**ATM Withdrawals** **Millions of USD**\n\n\nAs in the preceding phases of the attack, careful planning went into the choice of ATM locations to be used for cash\nwithdrawals, based on the following criteria:\n\n**1.** Location: those in solitary locations took precedence over those in locations with higher foot traffic.\n\n**2.** Degree of physical security: ATMs with no security cameras (or those with defective security cameras) were\n\nchosen as well as terminals that were not protected by security guards.\n\n**3.** The ability to dispense substantial amounts of cash. ATMs (mis) configured to allow withdrawal of substantial\n\namounts of money were chosen. (Specifically, either very high or no daily withdrawal limits were selected).\n\n**4.** ATM locations were chosen in cities across Europe, (including former Soviet Union countries), and the Russian\n\nFederation. No selected ATM was located in the victim bank’s actual country.\n\nThe final stage of this hybrid operation took almost five hours to complete. This was the time required for each\nrogue account to be carefully manipulated and for simultaneous debit card withdrawals across the geographic\nregion to occur. As in the first phase of the operation where the mules played an active role in requesting the new\naccounts and debit cards, in the final phase the mules were employed to perform the cash withdrawals. Only a small\nnumber of the ATMs were equipped with security cameras, so a few mules were caught in action. Law enforcement\nrequested video footage from surrounding buildings’ cameras and this revealed that the mules met with other\nsuspects (probably direct members in the cybercrime gang) shortly after cashing out the debit cards. These\nmeetings were most likely to deliver the stolen cash, after keeping their fee.\n\n##### Malicious Code\n\nThroughout the distinct phases of the cyber-attack, we noted that attackers adopted the emerging tactic sometimes\ncalled “living off the land” which involves very limited use of actual malware in the form of malicious files and easily\ndetected protocols associated with Command & Control and data exfiltration traffic. Instead, the attackers used\nlegitimate Windows and PowerShell commands in combination with tools such as PSExec for lateral movement.\nNotably they also used plink.exe (Windows SSH client) to access RDP over an already established SSH tunnel.\nOther software components used in this operation were split among commercial monitoring application (Mipko\nEmployee Monitor) and the well-known suspect “Cobalt Strike Beacon” mainly used to maintain backdoor\nconnection with an endpoint geolocated in the United States of America.\n\nIt should be noted that after the attackers penetrated the bank’s network, they continually used a specific system\nto perform their activities. We focused our investigation on this system after backtracking malicious activities in the\nprocessor’s network to it. Remote Desktop activity on the processor network was identified to have originated from\nthe bank system. Eventually we asked the bank to provide this system for investigation. At that point, the bank’s IT\nstaff responded that this system became unbootable shortly after the massive cash out occurred.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Post Soviet Bank Heists: A Hybrid Cybercrime Study\n\nWhen we obtained a copy of the system for analysis we found it was unbootable and the file system was corrupt.\nHowever, the Trustwave team was able to reconstruct the partition table and analyze the file system enabling\ncollection and analysis of significant evidence from this key system. One of them was called dropper.exe and\nupon execution its main function was to wipe the Master Boot Record on the hard disk, effectively destroying the\nsystem for any future use. This was the last recorded action taken by the attackers before leaving the network. They\nappeared to truly care about clearing any remaining tracks of their activity that may have been left behind.\n\nOur investigation did not reveal any signs of data exfiltration from the bank itself. The bank’s network appears to\nhave been breached for two primary reasons:\n\n**1.** The bank had an established mechanism to connect to the processor’s network from several terminals inside\n\nthe bank network by first establishing a VPN session between the two networks and then using Remote Desktop\nProtocol (RDP) to connect from a system inside the bank network to the Windows Terminal Server in the\nprocessor’s network. By attacking the bank’s network, the attackers could piggy back on this connection to get a\nfoothold on the processor’s network (and subsequently obtain access to the card management application in the\nprocessor’s network)\n\n**2.** To withdraw funds from the newly issued debit cards for the “rogue” bank accounts, the attackers needed\n\nto obtain credentials of the bank employees that used the card management application on the processor’s\nnetwork. Using these credentials, they could change the necessary properties of the debit cards to cash out from\nATM terminals in the final stage of the attack.\n\nBased entirely on the precision with which the attack was carried out, we believe that the attackers had previously\nobtained deep inside knowledge of the bank’s network and systems. Similarly, they obtained an understanding\nof the processor’s environment, and of the card management software and how these systems could be used\nto manipulate a debit card’s sensitive properties such as its overdraft (OD) limit and its Risk Rating. These two\nparameters are needed to determine the account’s OD limit and therefore how much money the account holder can\nwithdraw.\n\nIt should also be noted that the attacker’s tradecraft suggests involvement of organized cybercrime groups; for\nexample, the attackers successfully wiped the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the hard disk attached to the main\nWindows system used in this attack. They used specialized malware intending to thwart any future forensic\nexamination of the system.\n\nIt goes without saying that the adverse negative impact of this incident was felt by both the bank and the processor:\n\n**•** The direct dollar value of the loss incurred by the bank pales in comparison with the harder to quantify intangible\n\nlosses suffered because of loss of trust and goodwill with its customers, partners and regulators. Also, the bank\ncustomers’ money remained intact as the debit cards that were used for ATM withdrawals were issued against\nthe newly created rogue accounts, none of which had any balance since they were set up.\n\n**•** In the case of the processor, while no direct monetary loss was incurred, the processor likely lost much more in\n\nterms of erosion of trust in their services both with the regulators and their clients (other banks).\n\n\n**Direct dollar loss**\n**and tangible**\n**adverse impact**\n\n**Adverse impact on**\n**trust and goodwill;**\n**negative impact on**\n**stock prices**\n\n\n**Brings weakness in**\n**system of controls**\n**to the forefront**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Post Soviet Bank Heists: A Hybrid Cybercrime Study\n\n##### Recommendations\n\n**•** Banks are advised to prepare a well-documented and tested Incident Response Plan (IRP) so they are better\n\nprepared to deal with such incidents swiftly and effectively.\n\n**•** In addition to implementing an effective (but inherently reactive) IR Plan, banks are also advised to consider\n\nsetting up a proactive program for Managed Detection & Response (MDR), also known as threat hunting, which\nwould allow banks to detect threats early on, and mitigate them before they have a chance to realize their full\npotential.\n\n**•** The success of these cyber-attacks may be attributed to failures in both technical and non-technical controls, for\n\nexample, the lack of coupling between the Core Banking System and the Third-Party Card Management System.\nHad these systems been integrated properly, it would have been much simpler for the changes to the debit card\nproperties to be red-flagged and blocked by the bank prior to successful monetary theft. Another example of\na non-technical control failure is that several accounts on the Card Management System were allowed to both\n“raise a request” for a change to be made, and to “approve” such a change. This is in clear violation of the\nvery commonly used type of control in banks and banking applications called Maker-Checker control (or the\n4-eye principle). Therefore, banks are advised to undertake not only a proactive cyber security risk assessment\nexercise, but also to undertake a holistic “business process” risk management exercise to detect and mitigate\nthese types of control weaknesses.\n\n**•** From a technical standpoint, success of these cyber-attacks may be attributed to the following reasons:\n\n  - First, the attackers were able to successfully spear phish and socially engineer bank employees to get an initial\n\nfoothold in their networks.\n\n  - Second, the attackers took advantage of the common approach of setting the same password for “Local\n\nAdministrator” accounts for all the systems in the Windows network, and the tendency of the systems\nadministrators to use the “Domain Administrator” account (over the network) to perform routine tasks, to\ncompromise other systems in the Windows network and eventually obtain the “Domain Admin” credentials.\n\nFor these reasons, we recommend:\n\n**•** A different approach (e.g. Windows LAPS) to managing Local Administrator account credentials for the systems\n\nin their Windows networks.\n\n**•** Restrict by policy the use of the Domain Admin account over the network unless absolutely necessary.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Post Soviet Bank Heists: A Hybrid Cybercrime Study\n\n\n##### Indicators of Compromise\n\n###### FILES\n\n**Table 1:\u0003 Indicators of Compromise (Files)**\n\n**File name**\n\nplink.exe\n\nnetscan.exe\n\ncrss.exe\n\nadobeArm.exe\n\ndropper.exe\n\nservicePS1.txt\n\nlor2.exe\n\njava.exe\n\nsys64.dll\n\nmpk.exe\n\nmpkview.exe\n\n###### IPS/DOMAINS\n\n**Table 2: \u0003Indicators of Compromise (IPs/Domains)**\n\n|File name|SHA256 Hash (malicious Files only)|Type|\n|---|---|---|\n|plink.exe|5A21A83DFB5822301896A696F3A1A3E8207BF541E11CD1F2BBB7BC666251D8C7|Legitimate tool but malicious usage|\n|netscan.exe|5748BFB17E662FB6D197886A69DF47F1071052C3381EB1C609A2BC5DBA8C2992|Legitimate tool but malicious usage|\n|crss.exe|D845AF9B15052D49CBE67960AF2A9E51EEAD4D1E21A0DE5C372D4925BA8E1B62|Malicious|\n|adobeArm.exe|DAAB0E5CF3D968B4144B781793763CC6672B30FACC5AF061D0469D6DFFFDA967|Malicious|\n|dropper.exe|DF8948696BB8759EDE500A6A27CE788F1438D1A57F114709D7239865C728B22C|Malicious|\n|servicePS1.txt|589B49D72115A24A0F898E3A5165AFF13BE29EA4A6190977BD046B8657C0D994|Malicious|\n|lor2.exe|97A34BCECF276F9B0E16770D43CEBB2AA3A2FACB47081507DF44A961E932220D|Malicious|\n|java.exe|EED138E53A748EC82A99633BC19020AE6C1D0F609CE3D6555389FB34437EBC02|Malicious|\n|sys64.dll|8A80CA46C0C18CC9B93D5130293A527AA8A925179FAA46597DDD087CD5B1A49F|Malicious|\n|mpk.exe|1940C9C9BFBBD64BA7079178CB819E3253E7057EAA8BEA136A99C90C9436782E|Legitimate tool but malicious usage|\n|mpkview.exe|8086C8836EBEDE1E7FCF3DEBDC009B0982193DF684A55047237C2112DD376AEA|Legitimate tool but malicious usage|\n\n|Host|Usage|Geo Location|\n|---|---|---|\n|192.52.167.228|C&C, Backdoor reverse connect IP|United States|\n|192.52.167.28|C&C, Backdoor reverse connect IP|United States|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### trustwave.com Copyright © 2017 Trustwave Holdings, Inc.\n\n\n-----",
