First of all, Exo works on Android versions\n4, 5, and 6. In some ads, it's also advertised as working on Android 7, but this may be just\nfalse advertising, since not all listings advertise this feature.\n\nFurthermore, crooks boast that the trojan doesn't need root access to work and that users\ncan't uninstall it manually, meaning they need to do a complete phone reflashing to get rid\nof Exo.\n\nOther features, taken from the AlphaBay listing are embedded below [original, unaltered\ntext]:\n\n- SMS intercept (send the sms content to admin panel in real time. If is desired with jabber\nnotifications too, can be configured for a target or by sender phone numbers)\n\n- Send SMS for a specified phone number\n\n- Hide/delete incoming sms (this feature works upto android 4.4 version)\n\n- USSD' requests\n\n- Web injects (show phising over targeted app names to steal data,\nusername,password,telepin whatever you want)\n\n- Custom injects could be made under customer request\n\n- CC Stealer (Steal CCs data Including VBV/MSC/SAFEKEY ) (CCs stealer can target the\ndesired apps. Example: Whatsapp, Viber, the Google the Play Store)\n-Jabber notifications for incoming new CCs or WebInject data or the SMS from specified\nphone numbers Collected\n\n- Lock / unlock device with a password / disable screen and phone use also can show a\ncustom page on locked screen\n-Uninstall the bot manually (without the PC / cable) is impossible\n\n- Wi-Fi access / mobile data automatic enabler, if detect stored wifi networks on range\n\n- Send Mass SMS to all contacts from the infected phone\n\n- Control the bot with SMS too in case no internet access\n\n- Exo Android Bot do not need Root privileges to work Correctly\n\n- Admin panel to manage your bots\n\n- Our bot works from 2.3 to 6.0.1 Android versions\n\nThe same AlphaBay listing provides a short FAQ section, which also provides a hint on\nExo's origins [original, unaltered text] [text in bold]:\n\n- we dont install admin panel files outside our servers, the customer will need to provide us\na vps/server root access to install frontend/proxy script\n\n- Customer must provide from 1 to 3 domains names where the bot be pointing to\n\n- we are noob friendly, which means we may guide you to setup all the neccesary stuff for a\nfast start on this android scene\n\n\n-----\n\n- if you consider our product is expensive and no worth, is not our problem if you dont have\nmoney. or dont have the intention to use our services and just want troll around\n\n- we are here to make happy our customers and be sure all the features which we are\noffering it works and continue working offering a good support\n\n**- this project was made from scratch ? answer : No, we purchased a base source**\n**code 4 months ago directly from his developer before he vanish from internet, and**\n**we began our own project and development/improvements/new features**\n\n- what if i rent your product and your dissapear? Answer : No definetly we are not going to\ndissapear or run away least for the next year\n\n- what other features are planned for the incoming months? Answer: VNC/Geo Fencing /\nFile Manager Browser and others\n\n- Why you are renting this if is stable and good as you say to be? Answer : Direct Financial\nto keep improving this project and be sure will be alive during many time, so we dont need\nto use our parallels earnings to use on this.\n\n- Where can i contact you? Answer : you may contact us directly on our sales jabber id :\n\n[REDACTED] (Serious people with serious deal only, Haters.Time waster pls stay away)\n\n- we dont provide apk builder\n\n- cleaning service? Answer : we delivery the apk file clenaed and include free cleaning 1\ntime monthly. for other cleaning services can be discussed\n\nAs you can see, the Exo author is providing a control panel for managing infected bots, but\nwhich buyers can access only via a proxy client installed on their own servers. Below are\ntwo GIFs depicting the Exo control panel, included in some of the ads.\n\n\n-----\n\nBleeping Computer reached out to one of the contacts listed in many of the ads, and we\nstumbled upon a person that admitted he was only a reseller, meaning Exo already runs its\nown affiliate system.\n\nBleeping Computer also reached out to Exo's creator(s), but we have not received any reply\nat the time of publishing.\n\nIn the original hacking forum ad, Exo's creator had listed the times of day during which he\nwanted to be contacted: \"14:00 — 20:00 MSK\". MSK stands for Moscow Time, which is a\npretty reliable (not definitive) clue on the hacker's location, taking into account the ad was\ninitially listed on a forum for Russian-speaking hackers.\n\nFurthermore, Exo includes a feature that prevents the trojan from executing on devices from\nusers located in former Soviet states, and the US. This filter is likely there so the author\nmay avoid getting on the radar of Russian or US law enforcement agencies.\n\nBleeping Computer has reached out to several security providers and inquired about\ncampaigns distributing Exo, as to assess the status of this current malware family, either as\na marginal player or as an active threat.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Top 10 Android banking trojans target apps with 1 billion downloads](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/top-10-android-banking-trojans-target-apps-with-1-billion-downloads/)\n\n[Mobile trojan detections rise as malware distribution level declines](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mobile-trojan-detections-rise-as-malware-distribution-level-declines/)\n\n[New ERMAC 2.0 Android malware steals accounts, wallets from 467 apps](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ermac-20-android-malware-steals-accounts-wallets-from-467-apps/)\n\n[SMSFactory Android malware sneakily subscribes to premium services](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/smsfactory-android-malware-sneakily-subscribes-to-premium-services/)\n\n[FluBot Android malware operation shutdown by law enforcement](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/flubot-android-malware-operation-shutdown-by-law-enforcement/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Android](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/android/)\n[Android Exo Bot](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/android-exo-bot/)\n[Banking Trojan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/banking-trojan/)\n[Exobot](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/exobot/)\n[Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a\nfew more.
