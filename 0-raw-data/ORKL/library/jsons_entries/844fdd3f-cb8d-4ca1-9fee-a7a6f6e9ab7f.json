Researching both the attacker’s infrastructure\nand tooling, we believe the nexus of the attack to be DPRK’s Kimsuky group (aka Velvet\nChollima). Kimsuky is notorious for their phishing efforts; researchers even dubbed this group the\n[“King of Spear Phishing” in a 2019 VirusBulletin paper. They are also believed to be behind the](https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2020/03/vb2019-paper-kimsuky-group-tracking-king-spearphishing/)\nattacks on [Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power in 2014. The potential targets identified in this research](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nuclear-southkorea-northkorea/south-korea-blames-north-korea-for-december-hack-on-nuclear-operator-idUSKBN0MD0GR20150317)\nrange from journalism to civil society organizations. We suspect the activity discussed here to be\npart of Kimsuky’s efforts to harvest credentials for espionage purposes though we can’t rule out\nfor certain that they aren’t other objectives.\n\nThe international NGO requested that we not share the contents of the phish or point out the\norganization they are working with. To protect their identity we will share our findings starting from\n[the Kimsuky nexus, which emanates from research published by Korean security firm](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.alyac.co.kr%2F3052)\nESTSecurity on a malicious document. From there, we’ll build out an understanding of additional,\nassociated infrastructure and potential targets gleaned from those findings.\n\n### Kimsuky Nexus\n\n[ESTSecurity inspected a malicious lure document discussing North Korean defectors. This lure](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.alyac.co.kr%2F3052)\ndocument contained a UPX packed binary that reached out to wave[.]posadadesantiago[.]com.\nBased upon their report we believe SHA256:\n[252d1b7a379f97fddd691880c1cf93eaeb2a5e5572e92a25240b75953c88736c, either is or is](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/file.xhtml?file=9F5EDB6D8A230C06512464FE84DB0056&owner=Common%20Community#/)\nstrikingly similar to the document discussed in their blog post based on these similarities:\n\nLure document text matches the screenshot\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Screen Shot From\n252d1b7a379f97fddd691880c1cf93eaeb2a5e5572e92a25240b75953c88736c\n\nThe binary used the same string obfuscation technique\nC2 URL hxxp://wave[.]posadadesantiago[.]com/home/dwn.php?van=101\nMalicious document VBA code similarities with what’s shown in the screenshots\nDigital signature signer name EGIS CO., Ltd. in the dropped file\n\nWe’ll use this document as the launching point to discover additional infrastructure most likely\nassociated with this attack.\n\n## Find All the Things\n\nBefore we get into our findings, we want to call out the infrastructure hunting techniques utilized\nbelow. Starting with a domain, we’ll look at the IP that hosts the domain and how many other\ndomains are hosted there. In cases where very few and/or similar domains are hosted at the IP,\nwe can assess with a reasonable level of confidence that the IP is dedicated to a single user.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Domain to Hosted On IP to Hosts Domains\n\nThe second primary technique used is pivoting off of similar subdomain values which use\nreasonably unique strings. Think of this as searching on the beginning or middle of a multilevel\ndomain name. Using login.un-phish.bad[.]com as a contrived example we’d search on login.unphish.* to see what other domains this subdomain was used under. The trick here is not\nsearching on a common string. Subdomain inspection can also hint at the activity behind the\ndomain or even who might be targeted. For example, seeing a URL starting with login suggests\nthat the URL is being used to harvest credentials. Finally, while infrastructure hunting may seem\nmore like an art than a science; remember to always look for additional data points like registrar\nor hosting information to corroborate the results.\n\nVirusTotal (VT) provides additional information on the malicious document. Here we are looking\nfor any In The Wild (ITW) file origin URLs listed. These URLs sometimes show IPs or domains\nthat served up the file. VT returns this ITW file origin URL:\n\nhxxp://onedrive.sslport[.]work/share/file/interview%20with%20a%20north%20korean%20defector.doc\n[(VT Link)](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/4444c37c684a628be261cabf8736271e753d883b46f0123fabb753720a2c1a16/details)\n\nWe now have a domain, let’s start the pivots!\n\n\n-----\n\n### IP Pivot\n\nTaking this domain, sslport[.]work, pivot off the IP hosting the domain to uncover a number of\ndomains hosted on the same IP.\n\nFigure 3: sslport[.]work to IP to Domains to IP to Domains\n\nIP: 108.62.141.33\n\ncom-download[.]work\ncom-option[.]work\ncom-sslnet[.]work\ncom-ssl[.]work\ncom-vps[.]work\ndesk-top[.]work\n\n\n-----\n\nintemet[.]work\njp-ssl[.]work\norg-vip[.]work\nsslport[.]work\nsslserver[.]work\nssltop[.]work\ntaplist[.]work\nvpstop[.]work\nwebmain[.]work\n\nThe domain com-download[.]work stands out as it was referenced in an article linked from the\nESTSecurity article above. The [article describes a phishing attempt against the Korean Studies](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&pto=aue&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=auto&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://www.rfa.org/korean/in_focus/nkhacking-05292020160533.html&usg=ALkJrhjv1NquqHlzN_8cgoKTjigGU1AwAQ)\nInstitute at George Washington University.\n\nNext, let’s look into subdomains used.\n\n### Enumerating Subdomains\n\nFocusing on sslport[.]work again, we see some interesting subdomains under the pDNS tab in\nDomainTools Iris:\n\nFigure 4: sslport[.]work pDNS\n\nThese two entries:\n\nmail.rfanews.sslport[.]work\nmail.rfa.sslport[.]work\n\n\n-----\n\n[lead to a potential target — Radio Free Asia, a](https://www.rfa.org/)\nbroadcast organization that consistently reports on\nNorth Korea. The usage of RFA in the subdomain\nis suspicious but we can’t say for certain they were\na target as their likeness may have been used in\nattacks against other organizations.\n\nPulling on another thread from the same IP, we\nfind another potential target. These three entries\nappear when looking at the pDNS data in\nDomainTools for the IP 108.62.141[.]33.\n\nFigure 6: 108.62.141[.]33 pDNS\n\nregistry.ohchr.tlsmain[.]work\nwww[.]registry[.]ohchr[.]tlsmain[.]work\nwww[.]intranet[.]ohchr[.]tlsmain[.]work\n\n\nFigure 5: Radio Free Asia\n\n\nImmediately ohchr jumps out as it may spoof the “Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights”.\n\n\n-----\n\nBut wait! The trail does not stop here.\n\n\nFigure 7: OHCHR\n\n\n-----\n\n### Subdomain String Pivot\n\nPivoting off of the subdomain string intranet.ohchr.* using DomainTools Iris we identify additional,\nmost likely related, domains.\n\nFigure 8: Subdomain String Pivot\n\nIn particular these three domains appear to be related:\n\nintranet.ohchr.account-protect[.]work\nintranet.ohchr.org-view[.]work\nintranet.ohchr.org-view[.]pw\n\nUpon inspecting org-view[.]work further we find:\n\namaniafrica-et.org-view[.]work\ndoc-view.docomo.ne.org-view[.]work\nintranet.ohchr.org-view[.]work\nlogin-yahoo.org-view[.]work\nlogin.aei.org-view[.]work\nlogin.gordonchang.org-view[.]work\nlogin.microsoftonline.org-view[.]work\nlogin.un.org-view[.]work\nlogin.yahoo.co.jp.org-view[.]work\nlogin.yahoo.com-service.org-view[.]work\nofferhubs.org-view[.]work\nohchr.org-view[.]work\npreview.manage.org-view[.]work\nspurgentaction.in.ohchr.org-view[.]work\nwww.intranet.ohchr.org-view[.]work\nwebmail.org-view[.]work\n\nAdditional potential targets can be gleaned from this list.  At a high level these targets are civil\nsociety organizations.\n\nFirst, the subdomain amaniafrica-et appears to be masquerading as amaniafrica-et.org.\n\nIn addition to being a civil society organization, interest in this organization could be due to\ncommercial ties North Korea has had with different African nations over the years, according to\nthe [Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/north-koreas-surprising-lucrative-relationship-with-africa/2017/07/10/c4e6f65d-30fe-4bd2-b178-d90daaac3007_story.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe next one on the\nlist that jumps out is\nthe American\nEnterprise Institute\n(AEI). According to\ntheir [website, AEI](https://www.aei.org/about/)\nfocuses on defending\nhuman dignity.\n\n## Connecting the Dots\n\n\nFigure 9: Amani Africa Logo from their website\n\nFigure 10: AEI from their site\n\n\nConnecting the indicators with the potential targets graphically, we see a fair number of resources\ntargeting OHCHR.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: Adventure Graph (click to enlarge)\n\n## Timeline\n\nTaking just the domains and subdomains in this article and mapping it to a timeline, we can see\nthe continuous efforts Kimsuky is going through to gather credentials. The activity covered here,\naccording to DomainTool’s Iris, goes back as far as December of 2019 and is as recent as August\nof this year.\n\n## Potential Targets Uncovered\n\nBased on the identified subdomains, the following organizations are possible targets of this\ncampaign, or their likeness was spoofed in targeting other organizations:\n\nAmani Africa\n\n\n-----\n\nRadio Free Asia\nAmerican Enterprise Institute\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\n\nIn addition to these, Korean Studies Institute at George Washington University didn’t have a\nsubdomain that was indicative of them being targeted; however, they were still found via\ninfrastructure pivoting along with a public report of them being targeted. For the rest, we\nacknowledge that the subdomains used could be indicative of the target; they could also be used\nto go after third parties that might trust those organizations.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThreatConnect believes that Kimsuky will continue to target journalism and civil society\norganizations, particularly those focusing on North Korean issues. Organizations reporting on\nNorth Korea human rights violations or working with North Korean defectors need to remain\nespecially vigilant of phishing attacks that take advantage of the information sharing culture they\nare part of. Be wary of any link and/or attachment, especially those asking for credentials, and\nenable two factor authentication to mitigate actors’ access with compromised credentials.\n\n## Appendix\n\n[ThreatConnect Incident](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/incident/incident.xhtml?incident=4101914816#/)\n[IoC CSV](https://threatconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/ThreatConnect-Kimsuky-Phishing-Operations-Putting-In-Work-IoC.csv)\n\n\n-----",
