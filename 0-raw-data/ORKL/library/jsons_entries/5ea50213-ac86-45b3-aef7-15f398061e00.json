Simply put, RaaS involves selling or renting\nransomware to buyers who are called affiliates.\n\nIn the past, ransomware attacks were mainly launched by the ransomware operators\nthemselves. When RaaS entered the picture, however, it made it easier for a variety of\nattackers, even those who have little technical knowledge, to wield ransomware against\ntargets.\n\nEssentially, we observed an organized division of labor in groups using RaaS. As a result of\nthis development, the participants of the cybercrime ecosystem gain higher proficiency and\nspecialization with regard to specific tasks, with some focusing on penetrating networks and\nothers on running the ransomware or conducting ransom negotiation with victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Such specialization, coupled with refined extortion techniques and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti) [technical strategies,](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/locked-loaded-and-in-the-wrong-hands-legitimate-tools-weaponized-for-ransomware-in-2021)\nmakes modern ransomware a notorious threat. With the threat’s ever-growing reach, it was\n[predicted that ransomware attacks could cost billions in the next decade.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-cost-of-ransomware-around-the-globe-to-go-beyond-265-billion-in-the-next-decade/)\n\n## How RaaS operates: the underground as a breeding ground\n\n[While RaaS is based on the](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-as-a-service-what-this-means-for-enterprises) [software-as-a-service (SaaS) model where software can be](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/software-as-a-service-saas.asp)\naccessed online on a subscription basis, it also continues to evolve in its own ways, and this\n[fully functional and independent ecosystem thrives in the underground with its key players.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/commodified-cybercrime-infrastructure-exploring-the-underground-services-market-for-cybercriminals)\n\nAmong these key players are the operators, or those who develop and peddle ransomware.\nThey are usually organized in a group and have designated roles such as leader,\ndevelopers, and infrastructure and system administrators. More advanced groups might also\nhave other roles, such as recruiters, penetration testers (aka pentesters), victim analysts,\n[and negotiators.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-as-a-service-negotiators-between-hackers-and-victims-are-now-in-high-demand/)\n\nSome roles and tools might also be outsourced or acquired through affiliate programs. For\n[instance, some operators avail of access-as-a-service (AaaS), which can provide various](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/countering-cyber-proliferation-zeroing-in-on-access-as-a-service/)\nmeans of access to targeted organizations. Meanwhile, other groups could have strong\npenetration testing teams but might also lack the necessary ransomware software. Such\npenetration testing teams often participate as affiliates for RaaS and use affiliate program\nransomware tools and infrastructure when a target is compromised. Affiliates might belong to\norganized gangs themselves or might operate independently.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Comparison of direct ransomware operations (left) and RaaS operators (right)\n\nWith regard to the RaaS operation model, the RaaS-operating criminal group first needs to\ndevelop or acquire the ransomware software and infrastructure. They then proceed to recruit\naffiliates through online forums, Telegram channels, or personal connections, with some\n[operators investing as much as US$1 million for recruitment efforts. Once enlisted, affiliates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2020/10/06/revil-ransomware-gang-offers-1-million-as-part-of-recruitment-drive/?sh=64e7a3b7bab2)\ncan then launch their own attacks.\n\n[RaaS provides a win-win situation and a high payout for both operators and affiliates while](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/modern-ransomwares-double-extortion-tactics-and-how-to-protect-enterprises-against-them)\nallowing higher specialization in dedicated tasks. Affiliates can earn payouts without having\nto develop the ransomware themselves, while operators can directly make a profit from their\naffiliates. The payouts are normally organized using a revenue model for RaaS\n[subscriptions. The possible revenue models besides subscription are one-time payments,](https://www.beforecrypt.com/en/what-is-ransomware-as-a-service-raas-and-how-does-it-work/)\nprofit sharing, and affiliate marketing. With such business models, the ransomware operators\ncan fully focus on developing and improving their ransomware software and operations\nwithout needing to spend resources on other tasks, such as compromising targets or\ndistributing the ransomware themselves. Instead, these tasks are delegated to the RaaS\naffiliates.\n\n## The cost of operations and its impact on ransom demands\n\n\n-----\n\nIt goes without saying that there are operational expenses for any ransomware group. As a\nransomware group needs to spend money on tools, skilled personnel and monthly\noperational costs, ransomware attacks can indeed be expensive. A group leader thus needs\nto figure out how to cover the recurring cost of operation. In particular, the rental of network\ninfrastructure has its own cost, and many of the group members receive monthly salaries\nthat need to be paid even if the ransomware attack victims do not pay the ransom. A\nsuccessful payout from an attack is therefore necessary to cover the recurring operational\ncost of keeping a ransomware group running.\n\nThe one-time purchases of tools naturally come with their own price tags. Ransomware\ngroups and network penetration teams often do not develop the exploitation tools themselves\nbut prefer to purchase tools for initial access into organizations from third-party software\nvendors and underground market software developers who offer varying prices, either for onhand or customized tools.\n\nFor groups following RaaS models and services with double extortion techniques,\npercentage payouts for kit sellers and RaaS partnership programs have risen, with some\nallocating for a full set of operations personnel such as pentesters, victim analysts, and\n[negotiators, as advertised in ads in underground forums.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/trading-in-the-dark)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Job posts in underground forums for pentesters and programmers capable of\naccessing enterprise networks and performing privilege escalation\n\nRegardless of successful payouts, most of these personnel require payment for services,\nwhether such remuneration involves monthly salary or per-project\npayments.Estimating average monthly costs (such as salaries, servers, virtual private server\nrentals, service providers, tools, accesses, and infrastructure, among others), these groups\nmight spend at least US$100,000 upward to keep operations running. If these groups target\n10 companies at a time but only one victim can pay, that single organization carries the brunt\nof all the expenses that the groups make in addition to the profit they hope to have.\n\nHowever, many organizations still refuse to pay ransom demands, either because of their\ninternal policies, government regulations, or the assistance of authorities. Ransomware\ngroups do not look kindly on these refusals for payment, and they find ways to retaliate\n[against these companies. For example, Mespinoza operators threaten companies who](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-ransomware-gang-hunts-for-evidence-of-crime-to-pressure-victims-into-paying-a-ransom/)\nrefuse to pay, not just with the exposure of sensitive data but also with the threat of reporting\nthe victim’s illegal activities, such as tax fraud or evasion.\n\n## Avoiding certain targets\n\nIn the underground, ransomware operators also gradually developed a strategy for\ndetermining which targets to avoid. For instance, while the US remains one of the top targets\nfor all kinds of malicious activities, some ransomware operators discuss avoiding the country.\n[In the wake of high-profile ransomware attacks, authorities have been paying heightened](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/biden-releases-memo-on-critical-cybersecurity-infrastructure-bill.html)\nattention to the threat. As a result, [no-pay policies,](https://securityboulevard.com/2021/07/q2-ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority/) [government assistance to victims for](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-government-launches-first-one-stop-ransomware-resource-stopransomwaregov)\n[ransom negotiation, and techniques to recover paid ransom could cause ransomware groups](https://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-used-hackers-bitcoin-password-to-recover-colonial-pipeline-ransom-2021-6)\nto have a harder time getting paid.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd while some groups have turned their attention to Asia, ransomware groups generally\navoid, for example, going after Taiwanese companies because of the strict anti-money\nlaundering policies that make it difficult to legally purchase cryptocurrency and keep\norganizations from paying the demanded ransom.\n\n[Other factors that can keep threat actors from attacking a certain region are the operators’](https://therecord.media/i-scrounged-through-the-trash-heaps-now-im-a-millionaire-an-interview-with-revils-unknown/)\npatriotism, countries’ poverty levels, or geopolitical situations that targets are in. For such\nlocations that are struggling economically and politically, or for countries that operators feel a\nsense of loyalty to, threat groups opt to use other monetization activities, such as the sale or\nrental of compromised assets or the use of keyloggers for harvesting various credentials,\n[which later on can be sold individually or through a “cloud of logs.”](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/cybercriminal-cloud-of-logs-the-emerging-underground-business-of-selling-access-to-stolen-data)\n\n## Recent updates on RaaS operations\n\nThis year, there were also momentary but noticeable changes in the underground. After\nDarkSide’s attack on Colonial Pipeline, all topics related to ransomware were banned on\nmany underground forums. Operators shifted to discreet advertising in underground forums\nfor system administrators, pentesters, and other seemingly legitimate jobs without disclosing\nthe purpose behind these ads. When it is discovered that the individuals behind these post\nare actually hiring for the purpose of operating ransomware, their accounts are banned.\n\nRansomware operators have also become more selective of their targets. We observed\ndiscussions in public and private groups about being more careful when choosing potential\nvictims and specifically avoiding political and critical infrastructure as well as the healthcare\nsector as targets.\n\nProfit division has also changed. Profits used to be usually divided into 70% and 30% in\nfavor of the affiliate when ransom demands were between five to six figures. Now, groups\ncollecting up to seven figures allot a 20% “finder’s fee” for access, while lateral movement\nand penetration testing are now done within the salaried group. This was the observed\nbehavior for groups like Nefilim. Based on growing popularity in forum discussions, hiring\nmore pentesters to become part of the salaried group and the continued professionalization\nof AaaS might likely continue to keep more of the profit intact and inside the main group.\n\n[The latest attacks also provide insight into where this is all heading. Based on REvil (aka](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomwares-new-linux-encryptor-targets-esxi-virtual-machines/)\n[Sodinokibi) and DarkSide’s previous attacks on Linux-based VMware ESXi servers and](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/e/darkside-linux-vms-targeted.html)\nnetwork-attached storage (NAS), there is a likelihood that other RaaS groups will be\nexpanding their targets and attacks to non-Windows servers, targeting other operating\nsystems such as Linux CentOS, Linux RedHat, and other UNIX flavors, all of which are\nPortable Operating System Interface (POSIX) compliant.\n\n## Ransomware families used by RaaS operators and affiliates\n\n\n-----\n\nMost [modern ransomware families have adopted the RaaS model. In our midyear](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/modern-ransomwares-double-extortion-tactics-and-how-to-protect-enterprises-against-them)\ncybersecurity report, we found the top 10 most detected ransomware families. Interestingly,\neight of these families have been used by RaaS operators and affiliates at some point. Some\nfamilies, such as [Locky,](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/ransomware-as-a-service-raas/) [Cerber, and](https://www.varonis.com/blog/cerber-ransomware/) [GandCrab, have been used in previous instances of](https://www.varonis.com/blog/cerber-ransomware/)\nRaaS operations, although these variants have not been actively employed for attacks\nrecently. Nevertheless, they are still being detected in affected systems:\n\nFigure 3. First half of 2021 data for most detected ransomware families that have been\nRaaS-operated at some point\n\nBased on this list, here are some of the ransomware families used by RaaS operators and\naffiliates to launch critical attacks this year:\n\n\n-----\n\n## REvil\n\n[Before suddenly disappearing, REvil consistently made headlines this year due to its high-](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/a/sodinokibi-ransomware.html)\n[profile attacks, including those launched on meat supplier JBS and IT company](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-attributes-jbs-ransomware-attack-to-revil/) [Kaseya. It’s](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/g/it-management-platform-kaseya-hit-with-sodinokibi-revil-ransomwa.html)\nalso the fourth overall most detected ransomware in our 2021 midyear data, with 2,119\ndetections. After disappearing for about two months, this group recently brought their\n[infrastructure back and demonstrated signs of renewed activities.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-is-back-in-full-attack-mode-and-leaking-data/)\n\n[This year, REvil demanded huge ransoms: US$70 million for the Kaseya attack (said to be](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/jbs-paid-11-million-to-revil-ransomware-225m-first-demanded/)\n[record-breaking) and US$22.5 million (with US$11 million paid) for the JBS attack.](https://www.crn.com/news/security/revil-demands-record-70m-in-kaseya-ransomware-attack)\n\nFigure 4. REvil affiliate recruitment in underground forums\n\n**Techniques**\n\nWhile most techniques used by ransomware gangs remain the same from our most recent\nupdate, they also employed some new techniques, such as the following:\n\n**Download and execution**\n\n[An attachment (such as a PDF file) of a malicious spam email drops Qakbot into the](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/80/qakbot-a-prevalent-infostealing-malware)\nsystem. The malware will then download additional components and the payload.\n[CVE-2021-30116, a zero-day vulnerability affecting the Kaseya VSA servers, was used](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30116)\nin the Kaseya supply-chain attack.\n\n**Discovery**\n\n[Additional legitimate tools, namely AdFind, SharpSploit, BloodHound, and NBTScan,](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/locked-loaded-and-in-the-wrong-hands-legitimate-tools-weaponized-for-ransomware-in-2021)\nare also observed to be employed for network discovery.\n\n## DarkSide\n\n\n-----\n\n[DarkSide has also been prominent in the news lately due to its attack on Colonial Pipeline.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/e/what-we-know-about-darkside-ransomware-and-the-us-pipeline-attac.html)\n[The targeted company was coerced to pay US$5 million in ransom. DarkSide ranked](https://www.crn.com/news/security/colonial-pipeline-paid-5m-to-darkside-hours-after-attack-report)\nseventh with 830 detections in our midyear data on most detected ransomware families.\n\n[Operators have since claimed that they will shut down operations due to pressure from](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/business/darkside-pipeline-hack.html)\nauthorities. However, as with the case of some ransomware families, they might just lie low\nfor a while before resurfacing, or come out with the threat’s successor.\n\n**Techniques**\n\n[As discussed in our earlier report, some of the notable techniques utilized by DarkSide are](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/e/what-we-know-about-darkside-ransomware-and-the-us-pipeline-attac.html)\nthe following:\n\n**Reconnaissance**\n\n[For this phase, DarkSide abuses various tools, namely PowerShell, Metasploit](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/locked-loaded-and-in-the-wrong-hands-legitimate-tools-weaponized-for-ransomware-in-2021)\nFramework, Mimikatz, and BloodHound.\n\n**Lateral movement**\n\n[For lateral movement, DarkSide aims to gain Domain Controller (DC) or Active](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-vs-darkside-ransomware)\nDirectory access. This is used to harvest credentials, escalate privileges, and gather\nvaluable assets that will be exfiltrated.\nThe DC network is then used to deploy the ransomware to connected machines.\n\n## Nefilim\n\nNefilim is the ninth most detected ransomware for midyear 2021, with 692 detections.\nAttackers that wield the ransomware variant set their sights on companies with billion-dollar\nrevenues.\n\n[Like most modern ransomware families, Nefilim also employs double extortion techniques.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti)\n[Nefilim affiliates are said to be especially vicious when affected companies don’t succumb to](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/f/nefilim-modern-ransomware-attack-story.html)\nransom demands, and they keep leaked data published for a long time.\n\n**Techniques**\n\n[Nefilim makes use of a variety of techniques such as the following:](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/b/nefilim-ransomware.html)\n\n**Initial access**\n\nNefilim can gain initial access through exposed RDPs.\nIt can also use Citrix Application Delivery Controller vulnerability (aka CVE-201919781) to gain entry into a system.\n\n**Lateral movement and defense evasion**\n\n\n-----\n\nNefilim is capable of lateral movement via tools such as PsExec or Windows\nManagement Instrumentation (WMI).\nIt performs defense evasion through the use of third-party tools like PC Hunter,\nProcess Hacker, and Revo Uninstaller.\n\n## LockBit\n\n[LockBit resurfaced in the middle of the year with LockBit 2.0, targeting more companies as](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/lockbit-resurfaces-with-version-2-0-ransomware-detections-in-chi.html)\nthey employ [double extortion techniques. Based on our findings, Chile, Italy, Taiwan, and the](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti)\nUK are among the most affected countries. In a recent prominent attack, ransom demand\nwent up as high as US$50 million.\n\nLockBit 2.0 claims to have one of the fastest encryption techniques among other\nransomware. It also shows similarities with prominent ransomware families, Ryuk and\nEgregor.\n\nFigure 4. LockBit affiliate recruitment in underground forums\n\n**Techniques**\n\nSome of the updated ransomware’s techniques are the following:\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\nOperators provide StealBit (detected by Trend Micro as\nTrojanSpy.Win32.STEALBIT.YXBHM), a tool that can automatically exfiltrate data, to\ntheir affiliates to help the latter harvest assets.\n\n**Defense evasion**\n\nTo terminate processes and services, the following batch files are used:\n\n\n-----\n\ndelsvc.bat (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.BAT.KILLPROC.D) makes crucial\nprocesses (such as MySQL and QuickBooks) and services (such as Microsoft\nExchange) unavailable.\nAV.bat (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.BAT.KILLAV.WLDX) uninstalls the antivirus\nprogram ESET.\nLogDelete.bat (detected by Trend Micro as PUA.BAT.DHARMA.A) clears Windows\nevent logs. Defoff.bat (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.BAT.KILLAV.WLDX) disables\nWindows Defender features such as real-time monitoring.\n\n**Impact**\n\nDevices are automatically encrypted across Windows through the abuse of Active\nDirectory group policies.\n\n## Conti\n\nConti is probably one of the largest ransomware groups operating today. It is often said to be\nthe successor of the Ryuk ransomware, as the former shares some similarities with the latter.\nFor example, with regard to tactics, both Conti and Ryuk are distributed via Emotet, Trickbot,\nand BazarLoader. In our [midyear roundup report data, Conti was the tenth most detected](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/threat-reports/roundup/attacks-from-all-angles-2021-midyear-security-roundup)\nransomware, as it amassed 610 detections.\n\nRecently, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released an\n[alert notice with regard to a surge in Conti ransomware attacks. Conti penetration-testing](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-265a)\ndocuments, which provide detailed information on the operators’ preferred techniques, were\n[also leaked.](https://github.com/ForbiddenProgrammer/conti-pentester-guide-leak)\n\n**Techniques**\n\n[Some notable techniques of the Conti ransomware are as follows:](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/c/vision-one-tracking-conti-ransomware.html)\n\n**Initial access**\n\nConti can use malspam to gain entry into the system.\nIt can also exploit known vulnerabilities for initial access.\n\n**Discovery, lateral movement, and persistence**\n\nConti can use open-source and off-the-shelf commercial tools, such as\n[PowerSploit, Metasploit, ADFind, and](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/08/01/bazarcall-to-conti-ransomware-via-trickbot-and-cobalt-strike/) [Cobalt Strike for discovery and lateral](https://michaelkoczwara.medium.com/conti-ransomware-group-cobalt-strike-c2-analysis-rdp-persistence-cc535d35eaba)\nmovement.\nOther commercial tools, such as AnyDesk, can also be used by Conti to maintain\npersistence on compromised targets.\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\n\n-----\n\nMega cloud storage can be used for the information exfiltration phase.\n\n**Defense evasion**\n\nDefense evasion can be performed through the use of third-party tools like PC Hunter,\nProcess Hacker, and Revo Uninstaller.\nConti also disables some security tools found in compromised systems.\n\n## How to defend systems against ransomware\n\n[For enterprises to protect themselves from ransomware attacks, it would help to establish](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/the-state-of-ransomware-2020-s-catch-22)\nransomware defense plans. These can be based on security frameworks, such as those\nfrom the [Center of Internet Security (CIS) and the](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/) National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology (NIST). These guidelines can help with prioritization and resource management\nfor prevention, defense, and recovery from ransomware.\n\nBeyond the technical means, it is important to understand that attackers will use any\nidentified weakness within a target organization (such as customer data, mishandled\npersonal identifiable information [PII], or accounting mistakes) as pressure points to leverage\nthe ransom negotiation value and make the victim pay. Enterprises should therefore take\nthese issues into account when evaluating their organizational readiness to protect\nthemselves from ransomware attacks.\n\nSome of the [best practices from these frameworks are as follows:](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/return-to-sender-preventing-ransomware-while-working-from-home)\n\n**Audit events and take inventory.**\n\nTake note of the following:\n\nAvailable assets and data\nAuthorized and unauthorized devices and software\nSecurity events and incidents\n\n**Configure and monitor.**\n\nManage and keep track of the following:\n\nHardware and software configurations\nAdmin privileges and access\nActivity in network ports, protocols, and services\nNetwork infrastructure devices, such as firewalls and routers, and their security\nconfigurations\n\n**Patch and update.**\n\nRegularly perform the following for software and applications:\n\n\n-----\n\nVulnerability assessments\nPatching or virtual patching\nVersion update\n\n**Protect systems and recover data.**\n\nImplement the following:\n\nData protection, backup, and recovery measures\nMultifactor authentication (MFA)\n\n**Secure and defend layers.**\n\nEmploy the following:\n\n**The defense in depth (DiD) principle. This is done by creating multiple layers of**\ndefense against potential threats. One example of this is by blocking unused services\nnot just on afirewall but alsoon actual servers.\n**Network segmentation and the least-privilege principle.
