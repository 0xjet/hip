    "plain_text": "###### From January 2019 to April 2020\n# Main incidents in the EU and worldwide\n\n\n-----\n\n### Overview\n\n\n**The sophistication of threat capabilities increased in 2019, with**\n\n**many adversaries using exploits, credential stealing, and multi-**\n\n**stage attacks. The number of data breach incidents is still very high,**\n\nand the amount of stolen financial information and user credentials is\n\ngrowing. In some cases, the failure to patch a known vulnerability that\n\nhas the potential to affect software or libraries in use - in a reasonable\n\ntimeframe – may have serious repercussions.\n\nDuring the past decade, malware has made ENISA’s list of top 15\n\n**threats, yet still many security systems are not able to detect this**\n\n**threat. For many years, malware was spread mainly through malicious**\n\ne-mail spam and more recently, using finely crafted phishing messages.\n\nTechnology companies and e-mail providers alike invested in spam\n\nfilters, improving the detection of malicious attachments. However,\n\n**adversaries are now innovating to increase their chances of**\n\n**reaching potential victims. Many of these innovations have paid back**\n\nto malicious actors during this period.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has put healthcare organisations and\n\nprofessionals worldwide under pressure, and health has become one of\n\nthe most critical sectors to protect against cyberattacks. The number of\n\nincidents involving ransomware targeting the healthcare sector was\n\nalready high but increased during the pandemic.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### __Top data breaches incidents\n\n|8 39 202 275|Col2|620|770 808|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n### Timeline\n\n\n###### _ January\n\nMEGA cloud (NZ) suffered\na data breach exposing\n770 million emails and 21\nmillion passwords.1\n\n###### _ October\n\n\n###### _ February\n\nVerification.io (US) exposed\nca. 800 million records.2\n\n###### _ September\n\n\n###### _ March\n\nNorsk Hydro (NO)\nvictim of a\nransomware attack.\n\n###### _ August\n\n\n3\n\n\nWebsites and the national\nTV broadcaster in Georgia\n(GE) suffered a coordinated\ncyberattack.30\n\n###### _ November\n\nUniCredit (IT) victim of a\ndata breach leaking 3M\nrecords.10\n\n\nMastercard (BE) suffered a\ndata breach affecting ca.\n90K customers in Europe.9\n\n###### _ December\n\nProsegur (SP) suffered a\nransomware attack\ndisrupting its operation..11\n\n\nBulgarian (BG)\nPersonal Tax Revenue\noffice suffered a data\nbreach exposing PII\nfrom all adult citizens.8\n\n###### 2020\n\n _ January\n\n\nAustria’s Foreign\nMinistry (AT) targeted\nby a cyberattack.12\n\n\n-----\n\n###### _ July\n\nCity Power (ZA) victim of a\nransomware attack\ndisrupting the energy\nsupply in Johannesburg.7\n\n###### _ February\n\n\n###### _ June\n\nFive hospitals in Romania\n(RO) hit by Badrabbit\nransomware.6\n\n###### _ March\n\n\n###### _ April\n\nOver 500K Zoom (US)\naccounts found for sale\nin the dark web.31\n\n\nINA Group (HR) victim of\nransomware attack.13\n\n\nENTSO-E (BE) network\ncompromised, victim\nof an intrusion.14\n\n\n-----\n\n### Most targeted sectors\n\n\n###### _In the line of fire\n\nThe sectors most targeted sectors during this period were digital\n\nservices, government administration and the technology industry.\n\nAttacks on digital service providers often serve as proxies to reach other,\n\nmore attractive targets. In contrast, attacks on the technology industry\n\nallowed malicious actors to compromise the supply chain or look for\n\nvulnerabilities to exploit.\n\nThe e-mail platform verifications.io18, suffered a major data breach due\n\n\nto an unprotected MongoDB database. Data from over 800 million e\nmails were exposed, containing sensitive information that included\n\npersonally identifiable information (PII).\n\nOver 770 million e-mail addresses and 21 million unique passwords\n\nwere exposed in a popular hacking forum hosted by the cloud service\n\n**MEGA1. It became the most significant collection of breached personal**\n\ncredentials in history, named ‘Collection #1’.\n\nThe cloud and virtualisation provider Citrix was a victim of a targeted\n\ncyberattack. To gain access to Citrix’s systems, the attackers exploited\n\nseveral critical software vulnerabilities such as CVE-2019-19781 and\n\nemployed a technique called password spraying.\n\n\n attack\n\n\nThe cloud hosting provider iNSYNQ\n\n\n19\nexperienced a ransomware\n\n\nthat left customers unable to access their data for more than a week,\n\nforcing customers to rely on local backups.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### __Most targeted sectors\n\n###### Digital Services_ Services such as e-mail, social and\n\ncollaborative platforms and cloud providers were under attack\n\nduring 2019. These were also used as proxies for further attacks.\n\n###### Government Administration_ The financial\n\nreturns from ransoms paid makes the public sector one of the\n\nmost attractive targets for ransomware attacks.\n\n###### Technology Industry_ The technology industry\n\nwas under attack in 2019 mainly through supply chain attacks\n\ntrying to compromise the development of software through zero\nday exploits and backdoors attacks.\n\n###### Financial_ The number of incidents with financial\n\norganisations and not necessarily banks, increased substantially\n\nduring the reporting period.\n\n###### Healthcare_ The number of attacks against the\n\nhealthcare sector continues to grow.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Trends\n\n\n###### _Across the board\n\n- In 2019, intense trojan-activity was observed across the globe.\n\nEmotet and Agent Tesla were the most frequently and dangerous\n\n\nmalwares\n\n\n[.](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl-2020-malware)\n\n\n\n- **[Phishing](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl2020-phishing)** remained one of the most successful techniques for\n\n\ndelivering malicious tools. Powerful phishing lures include phone\n\nscams, fake invoices, payments, quotations and purchase and sales\n\norders.\n\n\n\n- **Ransomware**\n\n\n[](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl-2020-ransomware) continues to generate substantial financial rewards for\n\n\nmalicious actors. A recent study identified human-operated\n\n\nransomware campaigns\n\n\n17, in which adversaries employ credential\n\n\ntheft and lateral movement methods traditionally associated with\n\ntargeted attacks such as those from nation-state actors.\n\n- **Card-skimming schemes have become a significant threat during**\n\n2019 and 2020 due to the increasing number of online shoppers.\n\n- **Business e-mail compromise (BEC) is a growing threat as a result of**\n\nthe vast amount of credentials and personal information stolen\n\nduring the last decade.\n\n- Companies experience an average of 12 credential-stuffing attacks\n\neach month, wherein the attacker is able to identify valid credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### __Findings\n\n#### 84%_of cyberattacks rely on social\n###### engineering\n\n#### 67%_of malware was delivered via\n\n34\n\n###### encrypted HTTPS connections\n\n#### 230.000_new strains of malware every\n###### day\n\n#### 6_months in average is what it takes to\n###### detect a data breach\n\n\n#### 71%_of organizations experienced\n###### malware activity that spread from one\n\n35\n\n###### employee to another\n\n\n-----\n\n### Actors\n\n\n###### _Who\n\nKnowing who is responsible or attributing responsibilities to a person or\n\na group for a cybersecurity incident is still a very daunting task and often\n\na worthless exercise. Yet, from a threat intelligence perspective, it is\n\nessential to classify behaviours, understand the dynamics and modus\n\n_operandi used by certain adversaries. This analysis often helps_\n\ndefenders to look for specific tracks and try to anticipate the next\n\nadversarial action.\n\nThe Lazarus Group for example, an allegedly state-sponsored advanced\n\npersistent threat (APT) group, was reportedly more active during the\n\nreporting period in both financially and espionage motivated attacks.\n\nThe group has been associated with several incidents, including the\n\n**AppleJeus campaign targeting cryptocurrency trading platform users**\n\nand their systems.22 Major incidents attributed to this group include:\n\n - hacking an Indian nuclear power plant and space research\n\norganisation in November 2019;\n\n - compromising a cryptocurrency trading app targeting exchange\n\nadministrators in October 2019;\n\n - attacking automated teller machines (ATMs) and banks in India,\n\nidentified in September 2019;\n\n - targeting Android users in South Korea through trojanised apps in the\n\nGoogle Play Store identified in August 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### Motivations\n\n\n###### _Why\n\nWhile it is challenging to determine the primary motivation behind a\ncyberattack, we can still categorise them based on the outcome of the\nincident.\n\n**Financial: The number of incidents resulting in the theft of information,**\ndata and user credentials is the highest observed during the reporting\nperiod. In most cases, the intention is to steal data/information and sell\nit on the dark web. Other uses of this information/data to enable other\ntypes of attacks with a completely different outcome such as espionage\nor financial fraud, can also be identified. More than 620 million account\ndetails were stolen from 16 hacked websites and offered for sale on the\npopular dark-web marketplace Dream Market.\n\n**Espionage: This is a motive behind an increasing number of reported**\nattacks, mainly due to ongoing geopolitical and commercial tensions.\nThe number of incidents is not substantial, but their size and magnitude\nput it second in ENISA’s list of top 5 motivations. Some noteworthy\nincidents include that reported in April 2019, in which a General Electric’s\nemployee and a Chinese businessperson were charged by the United\nStates Department of Justice with economic espionage and theft of\nGeneral Electric’s trade secrets.20 AgenceFrance Presse (AFP) reported\n\nthat Airbus had fallen victim to a sophisticated cyber-espionage\ncampaign. Attackers reportedly breached the IT systems of several of\nAirbus’s suppliers and, from there, penetrated the company’s IT\nsystems.21\n\n\n###### Top five motivations: financial, espionage, disruption, political and retaliation.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### __Top motivations\n\n\nThe figure below shows that Financial is still the primary motive\nfor the majority of cyberattacks. In some cases, multiple\nmotivations can be identified within a single attack. For example,\nespionage, political, financial and disruption are often combined\nmotives. Many incidents originate from automated systems and\nare delivered ‘as-a-service’, paid in cryptocurrency. These services\ninclude distribution of ransomware, command and control (C2),\ndistributed denial of service (DDoS), spam and other illicit\nactivities.\n\n|financial|espionage|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||disruption|retaliation|\n||political||\n\n\n-----\n\n### Attack vectors\n\n\n###### _How\n\nCyberattacks take on average three steps to reach a victim’s valuable\n\nassets. When reviewing the most frequently used attack vectors, we\n\nmust prioritise the entry point, course of action and action on assets.\n\nThese are the most critical stages that should constitute distinct\n\napproaches in a defence strategy.\n\n**Entry point: During 2019, the techniques used most frequently to start**\n\na cyberattack include brute force with stolen credentials, social\n\nengineering, configuration errors and exploitation of web applications.\n\nThe exploitation of web applications, for example, was often used as an\n\nentry point because of the growing uptake of this type of application to\n\ntransfer data to the cloud. Errors in cloud configuration and misuse of\n\nsystems were essential entry point in a large number of incidents. The\n\nuse of social engineering to plan an attack leverages from tools such as\n\n\nphishing and business e-mail compromise (BEC)\n\n\n16. Other techniques less\n\n\nfrequently but equally important are the exploitation of vulnerabilities\n\n(from unpatched systems and zero-days) and software backdoors, often\n\nused in more complex and sophisticated attacks.\n\n**Course of action: Installing malware is the technique most widely used**\n\nduring the ‘course of action’ stage. Once installed, it helps the adversary\n\nto do reconnaissance, move around the victim’s systems and networks,\n\ninstall additional tools such as ransomware, steal data and communicate\n\nwith a C2 server.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### __Five most desired assets by\n cybercriminals\n\n 01_Industrial property and trade secrets\n\nIndustrial property and trade secrets are the most desirable assets\nbecause of their high value to their owners, the market and some cases\nthe criminal world.\n\n###### 02_State/military classified information\n\nThis asset includes any information that a state deems sensitive. In\n2019, the trade and diplomatic tensions between countries made this\ntype of information even more attractive.\n\n###### 03_Server infrastructure\n\nServer infrastructure is the first sensitive asset that is not data. In many\nattacks, taking over the victim’s server infrastructure, is the primary\nobjective.\n\n###### 04_Authentication data\n\nAuthentication data is valuable assets for generating profits but also as\nan objective to support an attack.\n\n###### 05_Financial data\n\nFinancial data such as credit card, banking and payment information\nis always value to cybercriminals.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Strategic intelligence\n\n\n###### _What changed in the landscape with the covid-19 pandemic?\n\nIn 2019, ENISA continued mapping the threat landscape, helping\n\ndecision-makers and policymakers define strategies to defend citizens,\n\norganisations and cyberspace. This work is part of ENISA’s strategy to\n\nprovide strategic intelligence to its stakeholders. The central theme in\n\n2019 was the next generation of mobile telecommunications, or 5G,\n\nfollowing a request from the European Commission and Member States.\n\n**The agency will continue to produce these thematic threat**\n\n**landscapes and in 2020, the focus is on artificial intelligence.**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been a prolific period for malicious actors\n\nconducting attacks targeting sensitive areas such as healthcare service\n\nproviders and people working from home. ENISA is mapping the threat\n\nlandscape experienced during the pandemic and advising on mitigation\n\nmeasures that will attempt to reduce the exposure to threats.\n\nENISA shares its cybersecurity recommendations on the COVID-19\n\npandemic on a variety of topics including working remotely, online\n\nshopping and e-health, and it provides valuable up to date security\n\n\nadvice to the sectors affected.\n\n\n32\n\n\nThe Brno University Hospital in the Czech Republic suffered a\n\ncyberattack33 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced it to\n\nreroute patients and postpone surgery. The incident is considered\n\ncritical since this Hospital is one of the Czech Republic's biggest COVID\n19 testing laboratories.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### _COVID-19 threat landscape\n\nENISA prepared many resources for an awareness-raising campaign and\nshared other internal and external resources dedicated to cybersecurity\nexperts, covering security issues associated with challenges faced during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. One of these resources was an analysis of the\nmost critical threats during this period.\n\n\n-----\n\n### References\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### Related\n\n\n###### ENISA Threat Landscape Report The year in review\n\nA summary on the cybersecurity trends for\nthe period between January 2019 and April\n2020.\n**[READ THE REPORT](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl-2020-the-year-in-review)**\n\n\n**[READ THE REPORT](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl-2020-enisas-list-of-top-15-threats)**\n\n\n###### ENISA Threat Landscape Report List of Top 15 Threats\n\nENISAs’ list of the top 15 threats of the\nperiod between January 2019 and April\n2020.\n\n\n**[READ THE REPORT](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl-2020-cybersecurity-research)**\n\n\n###### ENISA Threat Landscape Report Research topics\n\nRecommendations on research topics\nfrom various quadrants in cybersecurity\nand cyberthreat intelligence.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ENISA Threat Landscape Report Sectoral and thematic threat analysis\n\nContextualised threat analysis between\nJanuary 2019 and April 2020.\n**[READ THE REPORT](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl-2020-sectoral-thematic-analysis-of-threats)**\n\n\n**[READ THE REPORT](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl-2020-emerging-trends)**\n\n\n###### ENISA Threat Landscape Report Emerging trends\n\nMain trends in Cybersecurity observed\nbetween January 2019 and April 2020.\n\n\n###### ENISA Threat Landscape Report Cyber Threat Intelligence overview\n\nThe current state of play of cyberthreat\nintelligence in the EU.\n**[READ THE REPORT](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl2020-cti-overview)**\n\n\n-----\n\n### RelatedOther publications\n\n\n###### Roadmap on the Cooperation Between CSIRTS and LE\n\nA roadmap on the cooperation across CSIRTs in particular\nwith national and governmental - law enforcement (LE) and\nthe Judiciary.\n\n**[READ THE REPORT](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/support-the-fight-against-cybercrime-roadmap-on-csirt-le-cooperation)**\n\n\n###### EU MS Incident Response Development Status Report\n\nA study aiming at the analyses of the current operational\nIncident Response set-up within NISD sectors and identify\nthe recent changes.\n\n**[READ THE REPORT](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report)**\n\n\n###### ENSIA CSIRT maturity assessment model\n\nAn updated version of the \"Challenges for National CSIRTs\nin Europe in 2016: Study on CSIRT Maturity\" published by\nENISA in 2017\n\n**[READ THE REPORT](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-maturity)**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### “The sophistication of threat capabilities increased in 2019, with many adversaries using exploits, credential stealing, and multi- stage attacks.”\n\n**_in ETL 2020_**\n\n\n-----\n\n### About\n\n\n###### _ The agency\n\nThe European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is the Union’s\nagency dedicated to achieving a high common level of cybersecurity\nacross Europe.
