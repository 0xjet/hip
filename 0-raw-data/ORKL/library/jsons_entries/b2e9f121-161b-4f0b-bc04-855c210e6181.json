The messages pose as Amazon Japan, suggesting that the recipient needs to\nreview their account for \"confirmation of ownership\" or \"updated payment information\".\nUpon clicking a link in the message, the recipient is taken to one of several variations of\nAmazon-themed credential phishing landing pages that\ncollect credentials, personally identifiable information (PII), and credit card numbers.\nMessages have been sent both to Japan-based organizations and those with a presence in\nJapan. The pages are geofenced to ensure that only Japan-based recipients are taken to the\ncredential phishing page.\n\nWhile popular brands like Amazon are often abused in credential phishing campaigns, the\nvolume of messages sets these campaigns apart from other Amazon-branded activity. The\ncampaigns run continuously, sending hundreds of thousands of messages each day. As\nof mid-October, sometimes more than a million messages are seen in a single day,\nrivaling [Emotet message volume.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/comprehensive-look-emotets-summer-2020-return)\n\n## Lures and landing pages\n\nThe messages are well-crafted Japanese language lures with subjects suggesting that the\nrecipient's information needs an update or that their account has been locked:\n\nAmazon.co.jp アカウント所有権の証明（名前、その他個人情報）の確\n認 (\"Confirmation of proof of ownership of Amazon.co.jp account (name and other\npersonal information)\") (Figure 1)\n\nお支払い方法の情報を更新 (\"Updated payment method information\") (Figure 2)\n\n\n-----\n\nアカウントがロックされたので、ご注意下さい ( Please note that your account has\nbeen locked\") (Figure 3)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Lure with subject, “Confirmation of proof of ownership of Amazon.co.jp account_\n_(name and other personal information)”_\n\n_Figure 2: Lure with subject, “Updated payment method information”_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Lure with subject, “Please note your account has been locked”_\n\nImages in the messages, such as the Amazon logos, are hotlinked from free image hosting\nservices, and the same image URLs have been observed across multiple campaigns.\n\nThe messages purport to be from Amazon, though they come from email addresses\nthat initially were not disguised particularly well, such as these samples:\n\nrmlirozna[@]pw[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nfwgajk[@]zfpx[.]cn\n\ninfo[@]bnwuabd[.]xyz\n\ndc[@]usodeavp[.]com\n\nBy early October 2020, we began to see a shift in effort to make the from address appear\nsomewhat legitimate:\n\namaozn[@]ama2on[.]buzz\n\naccout-update[@]amazon[.]co.jp\n\naccount-update[@]amazon[.]com\n\nadmin[@]amazon-mail[.]golf\n\nIn examining the message URLs, we see that they contain parameters for OpenID (Figure 4),\nthe authentication protocol used by Amazon Japan. These URLs don’t appear to take the user\nto an OpenID implementation, but the parameters in the URL string exist to provide\nlegitimacy to the experience.\n\nWe identified what appear to be placeholder values in some URLs, suggesting perhaps some\nmessages were prematurely sent, or that the corresponding values weren’t available (Figure\n4).\n\n_Figure 4: URL with BRECEIVER_ADDRESS and BRAND_TEXT variables_\n\nWe also identified use of what appears to be a placeholder email address in some URLs,\n“a@b.c” (Figure 5). In other URLs observed, the recipient email address populates this\nparameter.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: URL with a@b.c and an OpenID path in place of variables_\n\nWhen clicked, the geofenced links in the message take the user either to a spoofed Amazon\nJapan login page (Figure 6), or if the user appears to be outside of Japan, to the actual\nAmazon Japan login page.\n\n_Figure 6: Spoofed Amazon Japan login page_\n\nUpon “logging in” with their Amazon username and password, the user is taken to a form\nthat collects various pieces of PII, such as address, birthday, and phone number (Figure 7).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Information phishing landing page, requesting the user’s country, name,_\n_birthday, zip/postal code, prefecture (state), street address, business name (optional), and_\n_phone number_\n\nThe form also collects credit card numbers, which are loosely validated through a script\nhosted on the same site, and zip codes, which are validated via an API call to a third-party\nservice (Figures 8, 9). Interestingly, the zip code we provided does not appear to be a\nlegitimate Japanese zip code, though no errors were returned upon submitting the\ninformation.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: Error indicating the credit card number originally provided (a random numeric_\n_string of the wrong length) is invalid_\n\n_Figure 9: Intercepted traffic illustrating the call to ”zipcloud.ibsnet[.]co.jp” for zip code_\n_validation, as well as calls to ”/ap/actions/validate?cxdi=” for credit card number_\n_validation_\n\nAfter submitting valid information, users are thanked for updating their information, told\nthey may now access their account, and redirected to the real Amazon Japan site at\namazon.co[.]jp.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: Post-submission page informing users that they may now access their account_\n\n## Message volume\n\n_Figure 11: Message volume, August 2020 through October to date_\n\nProofpoint has tracked these messages since mid-August, but we have identified activity as\nearly as June 2020 that appears to be tied to the same actor. While the messages are in\nJapanese and the landing pages geofenced to Japanese IPs, there is no clear pattern among\n\n\n-----\n\nrecipients or industries, beyond being based in Japan or having business presence in\nJapan. Given the loosely linear trajectory of daily message volume observed through late\nAugust and September, volume could continue to increase over the coming months.\n\n**Month** **Average Message Volume Per Day**\n\nAugust (from 8/18-8/30) 122,000\n\nSeptember 424,000\n\nOctober (to date) 750,000\n\n## Infrastructure \n\nTypically, the credential phishing landing page is an IP address, followed by “/ap/signin”:\n\nhxxp://103.192.179[.]54/ap/signin\n\nLess often, a domain is used in lieu of an IP address:\n\n00pozrjbpm[.]xyz/ap/signin\n\nHundreds of IP addresses have been used across multiple campaigns, as the actor tends to\nadopt new IP addresses for each campaign, rather than reuse IP addresses. IP\naddresses belong to a variety of autonomous systems, with no clear pattern\namong geographies or providers.\n\n|Month|Average Message Volume Per Day|\n|---|---|\n|August (from 8/18-8/30)|122,000|\n|September|424,000|\n|October (to date)|750,000|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12: Top AS names for IP addresses used in lures from August 2020 through October_\n_to date_\n\nThe domains used are *.xyz or *.cn TLDs, and some have been observed across multiple\ncampaigns.

Like the previous set of\ndomains, the creation dates and registrant information suggest that they may be related in\nsome way. Moreover, “rxbnn3[@]163[.]com” is a prolific domain registrant, as this address\nappears as a registrant contact across 251 domains as of this publication. In addition to the\ndomains associated with rxbnn3[@]163[.]com shown above, the email is also linked to a\n[number of domain generation algorithm-like domains:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_generation_algorithm)\n\nswwkppe[.]cn\n\nlmkafwgi[.]cn\n\npdscmkq[.]cn\n\nawsmgrc[.]cn\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Amazon brand is commonly spoofed by threat actors seeking credentials, but the volume\nand persistence of these campaigns set them apart from other Amazon-themed activity. The\nconsistent reuse of message assets, landing pages, and steadily increasing message volume\nsuggest that this activity could be driven by a botnet. Moreover, there is no apparent weekend\nlull in message volume, as we sometimes observe with less automated operations. If this is\nindeed powered by a botnet, it’s unlikely that message volume will decrease soon. Threat\nactors often make incremental changes to their operations, and elements like different\nbranding or collection of slightly different information could be easy pivot points for this\nactor over the coming months.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n|getongliao[.]cn|2019-09-20|Registrant: 王帅国 Registrant Contact Email: rxbnn3[@]163[.]com|\n|---|---|---|\n\n|IOC|IOC Type|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|hxxp://182.16.26[.]194/ap/signin|URL|Amazon Japan credential phish landing page|\n\n\n-----\n\n|hxxp://23.133.5[.]144/ap/signin|URL|Amazon Japan credential phish landing page|\n|---|---|---|\n|hxxp://43.249.30[.]212/ap/signin|URL|Amazon Japan credential phish landing page|\n|00pozrjbpm[.]xyz/ap/signin|URL|Amazon Japan credential phish landing page|\n|jiyingkou[.]cn/ap/signin|URL|Amazon Japan credential phish landing page|\n|enjinchang[.]cn/ap/signin|URL|Amazon Japan credential phish landing page|\n\n\n**Update 30 June 2021: Proofpoint is still tracking this activity however it is no longer using**\ngeofencing techniques.\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\nSelect\n\n\n-----",
