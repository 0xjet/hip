On Windows, the app downloaded and\n[infected users with Fallchill, a remote access trojan (RAT) known to be associated with the](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/trojan-variants/fallchill)\nLazarus Group since at least 2016, when it was deployed for the first time in live\ncampaigns.\n\nBut unlike previous Lazarus operations, the hackers also deployed a Mac malware strain,\nsomething they have not done before. The malware was hidden inside the Mac version of\nthe same cryptocurrency trading software.\n\nExperts say that both the Windows and Mac malware wasn't visible inside the tainted app.\nLazarus operators did not embed the malware inside the third-party app directly but merely\nmodified its update component to download the malware at a later date.\n\n## The mystery of the malware's certificate\n\nFurthermore, the trojanized cryptocurrency trading software was also signed by a valid\ndigital certificate, allowing it to bypass security scans.\n\nThe big mystery surrounding this certificate is that it was issued by a company that\nKaspersky experts said they weren't able to prove it ever existed at the address in the\ncertificate's information.\n\n\"The fact that they developed malware to infect macOS users in addition to Windows users\nand – most likely – even created an entirely fake software company and software product in\norder to be able to deliver this malware undetected by security solutions, means that they\nsee potentially big profits in the whole operation, and we should definitely expect more such\ncases in the near future,\" Kamluk says.\n\n## Kaspersky didn't name the hacked cryptocurrency exchange\n\nSeveral cyber-security firms have pointed out many times this year that since the start of\n2017, North Korean hackers have shown great interest in penetrating cryptocurrency\nexchanges and financial institutions, from where they steal funds that they later bring back\ninto North Korea.\n\nIn the past year, several Asian cryptocurrency exchange platforms suffered security\nincidents, primarily exchange platforms located in South Korea.
