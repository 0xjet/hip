Well, not only was it not true for the\npast 25 years, but we now live in an age where Linux is as promising a target for threat\nactors as some Windows endpoints due to its widespread usage as an operating system\n(OS) across many organizations. And, even more importantly, it serves as the OS for popular\nInternet-of-Things (IoT) devices. This article deals with the evolution of the Sysrv malware\nthat infects Linux devices.\n\nNowadays, the Linux IoT threat landscape is highly homogeneous and consists mainly of\n[Mirai and Gafgyt forks. Nevertheless, new breeds do surface and spread through poorly](https://cujo.com/mirai-gafgyt-with-new-ddos-modules-discovered/)\nsecured and vulnerable IoT devices.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis blog post takes a deep dive into the Sysrv botnet, which first made headlines at the end\nof December 2020 and has continued to evolve since then. As of the time of writing, Sysrv is\nstill active and has gone through several iterations, meaning its developers continued to\nenhance its capabilities. Our analysis shows how it evolved, gained new features, and\nchanged its behavior up until today.\n\n## Overview of the Sysrv Botnet\n\n[The Sysrv botnet was first mentioned in a blog post by Intezer at the end of December 2020.](https://www.intezer.com/blog/research/new-golang-worm-drops-xmrig-miner-on-servers/)\nIt stood out due to its use of Golang (Go) – a relatively new programming language that a\ngrowing number of malware developers have picked up since early 2020.\n\n[Learn more about reverse engineering Golang binaries with Ghidra.](https://cujo.com/reverse-engineering-go-binaries-with-ghidra/)\n\n### Using Golang\n\nThere are several reasons why a malware developer might choose Golang:\n\nMost importantly, Go has cross-compilation capabilities that make it a popular choice. It\nallows malware developers to maintain only a single codebase and then quickly build\nexecutables for various architectures.\nGolang binaries are considered harder to reverse-engineer due to their file size\n(many functions to go through). Also, few decompilers and disassemblers support\nGolang.\nGo is popular among developers thanks to its low barrier to entry, performance\n**benefits, and flexibility.**\n**Leaked botnet source codes are available in Golang, such as the C&C (command**\nand control) module for Mirai.\n\n### What is Sysrv\n\nAt its core, Sysrv is a worm and a cryptocurrency miner. The two modules were in\nseparate files in its early versions, but its developers have since combined the two. The\nworm module simply initiates port scans against random IPs to find vulnerable Tomcat,\nWebLogic, and MySQL services and tries to infiltrate the servers with a hardcoded password\ndictionary attack.\n\nAs Sysrv continued to evolve, it gradually introduced more exploits into its arsenal to\nenhance its worm capabilities. The malware propagation starts with a simple loader script\nfile, which pulls down those modules upon successful execution.\n\nThe botnet is distributed for both Linux and Windows environments, but in this blog post, we\nwill detail the inner workings of the Linux variant.\n\n## A Brief Timeline of Sysrv\n\n\n-----\n\nClick the image to open it in a new tab\n\n\n-----\n\n## Sysrv’s Technical Details and Analysis\n\n### The Loader Scripts\n\nTwo Sysrv loader scripts are circling for Linux and Windows: ldr.sh and ldr.ps1, respectively.\nBoth achieve the same thing, even though they are written in different languages: the former\nin Bash and the latter in Powershell.\n\nThe ldr.ps1 loader script\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ldr.sh loader script\n\nThe first version of the Linux loader script had a few interesting functions like:\n\nDistribution server and ID were hardcoded\n64-bit check (getconf LONG_BIT)\nKill existing sysrv process (pkill -9)\nEnumerate processlist to see if sysrv process is running (ps -fe)\nGet function to download binary (curl, get, php -r)\n\nAs the development progressed, these features underwent significant revisions, and new,\nimproved functions can be seen in the latest loader scripts. These new, enhanced features\ninclude:\n\ncurl with a timeout parameter and five retries\nExit if a 32-bit system is detected\nKill running mining process (network01, kthreaddi)\nEdit crontab file to achieve persistence\nUser-Agent changed to _ldr$bit and _cron\nIf crontab command is not available install cron via apt, crontabs via yum and start the\nappropriate services\nFiltering for high CPU consuming processes and kill them if not sysrv or network01\n(mining process)\nThe loader script includes the Miner dropper XMR32/XMR64 and an XMR configuration\nfile for the mining pool and crypto address\nBash history cleanup\nAnother mining pool in a config.json file\nChanging DNS resolvers to 1.1.1.1\n\n\n-----\n\nHardcoded SSH key for persistence\n/tmp/ folder cleanup\nKill processes listening on TCP ports 52018 and 52019\nRemoving and renaming the iptables binary\nAliyun AV software uninstaller\nDocker xmr image removal\nChecking for the presence of nvidia-smi tool, listing GPUs for cryptomining\n\nNewer versions also include a reference to the IoT botnet operator group #keksec.\n\nEver since the first appearance of the Sysrv botnet, new scripts have been released every\nmonth. March and April were the most active months for Sysrv development, as new scripts\nwere released almost every two days. The newest samples we examined appeared in the\nmiddle of September.\n\n**The number of new Sysrv Linux scripts per month:**\n\nDecember 7\n\nJanuary 4\n\nFebruary 2\n\nMarch 16\n\nApril 9\n\nMay 7\n\nJune 4\n\nJuly 1\n\nAugust 1\n\nSeptember 3\n\n### Main Sysrv Binaries\n\nNote: This research analyses ELF binaries, not Windows executables.\n\nIn total, we collected 61 Linux binaries. All these files, except for one, are 64-bit\nexecutables.\n\nWe see a recent slowdown in the number of new Sysrv samples appearing every month; the\nlatest ELF binary appeared on 20 September. After the initial samples were released, theth\nmost extensive binary development happened during March and April, just like for the\n\n\n-----\n\nscripts. Since then, only a few new samples appeared every month.\n\n**The number of new Sysrv binary samples per month:**\n\nDecember 7\n\nJanuary 7\n\nFebruary 2\n\nMarch 22\n\nApril 10\n\nMay 4\n\nJune 3\n\nJuly 4\n\nAugust 1\n\nSeptember 1\n\n**Grouping the binaries**\n\nTo aid our analysis, we first tried to branch out the investigation into smaller parts. A\nfundamental part was to try and group the observed samples by specific characteristics to\nsee:\n\n**How different the Sysrv samples are,**\n**How many variants there are.**\n\nAs every Sysrv binary we discovered was written in Golang, we grouped the malicious\nbinaries based on their package structures.\n\n**A package in Golang is a collection of source files in the same directory that are compiled**\ntogether. All constants, variables, functions, and types defined in one of the source files are\nvisible to every other source file within the same package.\n\nBased on this, we grouped Sysrv samples into eight groups. There can be minor differences\nbetween samples in the same group, but their main functionalities and structure are the\nsame.\n\n[To examine the package structures, we used Redress, a tool for analyzing stripped Go](https://github.com/goretk/redress)\nbinaries compiled with the Go compiler.\n\n\n-----\n\nRedress enumerating packages\n\n**Group** **Packages** **Count**\n\n1 1\n\nhello/src/exp\n\nhello/src/gateway\n\nhello/src/nu\n\nhello/src/scan\n\nhello/src/work\n\nmain\n\n2 3\n\nhello/src/exp\n\nhello/src/gateway\n\nhello/src/nu\n\nhello/src/scan\n\nmain\n\n3 1\n\nhello/src/exp\n\n\n-----\n\nhello/src/gateway\n\nhello/src/nu\n\nhello/src/scan\n\nhello/src/scan.(*Scanner).(hello/src/scan\n\nmain\n\n4 7\n\nhello/src/exp\n\nhello/src/nu\n\nhello/src/scan\n\nhello/src/scan.(*Scanner).(hello/src/scan\n\nmain\n\n5 1\n\nhello/src/controller\n\nhello/src/controller.(*Miner).(hello/src/controller\n\nhello/src/exp\n\nhello/src/nu\n\nhello/src/scan\n\nhello/src/scan.(*Scanner).(hello/src/scan\n\nmain\n\n6 hello/controller 13\n\nhello/exp\n\nhello/nu\n\nhello/scan\n\nhello/scan.(*Scanner).(hello/scan\n\nmain\n\n7 main 30\n\n\n-----\n\nshell/exploit\n\nshell/miner\n\nshell/nu\n\nshell/payload\n\nshell/scanner\n\nshell/scanner.(*Scanner).(shell/scanner\n\n8 adojibpbhgpfdfnnlnjk/aegcfimbndeabglkjjho 1\n\nadojibpbhgpfdfnnlnjk/bpmmbdkebhnagnakmbje\n\nadojibpbhgpfdfnnlnjk/efpdcgbhkocemnpjnnfo\n\nadojibpbhgpfdfnnlnjk/gbdgajdocapllhiljmoe\n\nadojibpbhgpfdfnnlnjk/gbdgajdocapllhiljmoe.(*Scanner).\n(adojibpbhgpfdfnnlnjk/gbdgajdocapllhiljmoe\n\nadojibpbhgpfdfnnlnjk/jemkgjopohlcdbjoccoe\n\nmain\n\n**Obfuscation**\n\n[Most malicious samples were packed with vanilla UPX, and during our analysis, we have not](https://cujo.com/upx-anti-unpacking-techniques-in-iot-malware/)\ndiscovered any other packers being used by Sysrv. The malware authors didn’t use any kind\nof obfuscation for the earliest samples.\n\nReading the code of the binaries was relatively easy thanks to the tools that help reverse\nengineer stripped Golang binaries. We’ve already mentioned using Redress, and we also\nused Ghidra for static analysis and several Ghidra scripts that our research team wrote to aid\nGolang analysis.\n\n[Our write-up about how to reverse engineer Go binaries can be found here.](https://cujo.com/reverse-engineering-go-binaries-with-ghidra/)\n\n**The first obfuscated sample appeared in April 2021, the only one that belongs to**\n**Group 8.**\n\nThis sample also had obfuscated Go packages and some function names.\n\n\n-----\n\nObfuscated packages recognized by Redress\n\nThe obfuscation tool used is gobfuscate, a known utility for Go binaries:\n\n[https://github.com/unixpickle/gobfuscate](https://github.com/unixpickle/gobfuscate)\n\nCurrently, gobfuscate can manipulate package names, global variable and function names,\ntype names, method names, and strings.\n\nBinaries released after that sample belong to Group 7. In these, some function names were\nobfuscated, but not the package names. Obfuscated names are used for the functions that\nare responsible for executing the various exploits.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 – no obfuscation\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 – with obfuscation\n\n**Mutex**\n\nMutex is a synchronization primitive. In malware, mutexes are mostly used to ensure that the\nmalware is not deployed to the target system already. This ensures that only a single\nmalware instance is running at a time, as multiple instances might hinder each other, leaving\nthe initially deployed malicious process to wreak havoc all by itself.\n\nIn Sysrv’s case, a check is implemented to see whether a hardcoded TCP port is open\n**on the infected system. If it is open, the malware will not re-infect the system.**\n\nThe appropriate functions are within the nu (network utility) package in all samples. A\nfunction called IsPortOpen is responsible for checking whether a specific port is open, and\nthis is called from one of the following four functions, based on the version of the binary:\n\n**MutexPort**\n**CreateMutex**\n**NewMutex**\n**SingleInstance**\n\nPort: 0xcb2d = 52013\n\nWe have observed the following TCP port numbers being leveraged as Mutex ports:\n\n52013 (0xcb2d)\n52014 (0xcb2e)\n52015 (0xcb2f)\n52016 (0xcb30)\n52017 (0xcb31)\n52018 (0xcb32)\n52020 (0xcb34)\n52021 (0xcb35)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Exploits in Sysrv\n\nSysrv included a small set of exploits in its initial campaigns. Over time, as it was developed\nand transformed, Sysrv continually incorporated new exploits to spread more effectively.\n\nSysrv is primarily targeting Linux and Windows servers, not IoT devices.\n\nInterestingly, we not only saw exploits being added to the code, but also some specific\nexploits undergoing several development stages. Sysrv’s developers updated some\nfunctions in multiple samples until they either reached a satisfying result or simply got rid of\nthem. Some exploits were used only in one or two samples, while others proved useful and\nstuck around.\n\nThe Ignition Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploit has the newest CVE number; it was\npublished in January 2021 and was already used by Sysrv at the beginning of March.\n\n### A list of Sysrv exploits\n\n**Exploits with the corresponding CVE number:**\n\n[CVE-2019-7238 – Nexus Repository Manager RCE](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7238)\n[CVE-2015-8562 – Joomla!

There are several reasons why\nMonero is a popular choice for attackers. Most importantly, its transactions are more difficult\nto trace and it can be mined using the CPUs of ordinary computers (whereas other\ncryptocurrencies require special hardware, such as application-specific integrated circuits –\nASICs).\n\n[Even though Sysrv uses the open-source XMRig project to mine Monero, each group for](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig)\nSysrv samples slightly differs in its crypto mining configuration. To see these differences, we\nextracted all miner modules and grouped them by their configuration.\n\n### Case 1 – Embedded miner, command execution\n\n[For the first sample, the miner was embedded in the binary using the go-bindata package.](https://github.com/go-bindata/go-bindata)\nAccording to its documentation, “this package converts any file into manageable Go source\ncode. Useful for embedding binary data into a go program. The file data is optionally gzip\ncompressed before being converted to a raw byte slice.” The miner is embedded as a gzip\nfile.\n\nOnce the embedded miner is extracted, it will be saved to the /tmp folder as network01. It will\nbe executed with the following command:\n```\n/tmp/network01 -B --donate-level 1 -o pool.minexmr.com:5555 -u\n49dnvYkWkZNPrDj3KF8fR1BHLBfiVArU6Hu61N9gtrZWgbRptntwht5JUrXX1ZeofwPwC6fXNxPZfGjNEChXtt\n\n```\nMining pool: pool.minexmr.com:5555\n\n\n-----\n\nMining address:\n```\n49dnvYkWkZNPrDj3KF8fR1BHLBfiVArU6Hu61N9gtrZWgbRptntwht5JUrXX1ZeofwPwC6fXNxPZfGjNEChXtt\n\n### Case 2 – Miner in a separate binary, script execution\n\n```\nFor the samples in Groups 2, 3, and 4, the miner is in a separate binary and executed by the\nscript files.\n\nMining pools:\n\npool.minexmr.com:5555\nxmr.f2pool.com:13531\n\nMining address:\n```\n49dnvYkWkZNPrDj3KF8fR1BHLBfiVArU6Hu61N9gtrZWgbRptntwht5JUrXX1ZeofwPwC6fXNxPZfGjNEChXtt\n\n### Case 3 – Embedded miners, configuration file input\n\n```\nFrom Group 5 until now, the miners are always embedded within the malicious binaries\neither in gzip or later directly as ELF files, using the same bin-data package we saw in Case\n1. In total, three different mining binaries were used in these cases. All of them are\nexecuted with a configuration file as an input.\n\nWe extracted the configuration files from all samples and found the following.\n\nMining pools:\n\n\n-----\n\nxmr-eu1.nanopool.org:14444\nxmr-eu2.nanopool.org:14444\nxmr.f2pool.com:13531\n\nMining address:\n```\n49dnvYkWkZNPrDj3KF8fR1BHLBfiVArU6Hu61N9gtrZWgbRptntwht5JUrXX1ZeofwPwC6fXNxPZfGjNEChXtt\n\n### Case 4 – WatchDog mining address\n\n```\nFor one specific sample (SHA-256:\n1c91ed47c3c0baa74fa15c9b02330701dd02fc1e9b44963e1fe9a650ef7b78ef) the mining\naddress is different from the one that all the others used. This address is\n```\n82etS8QzVhqdiL6LMbb85BdEC3KgJeRGT3X1F3DQBnJa2tzgBJ54bn4aNDjuWDtpygBsRqcfGRK4gbbw3xUy3o\n\n```\n[, which was observed in WatchDog campaigns.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/watchdog-cryptojacking/)\n\n### Case 5 – Proxying traffic to mining pools?\n\nIn recent samples attackers use a unique IP:port combination as the pool URL:\n_194.145.227.21:5443. The IP is the one from which they distribute the malicious files, and_\nprobably they use this specific port to proxy the traffic to the appropriate mining pools.\n\n## The Monetization of Sysrv\n\nAs one of Sysrv’s main objectives is to mine cryptocurrency on its infected targets, we\npeeked inside its monetization scheme.\n\nAcross the Sysrv malicious sample, Monero was the main cryptocurrency mined with a\ndedicated address:\n```\n49dnvYkWkZNPrDj3KF8fR1BHLBfiVArU6Hu61N9gtrZWgbRptntwht5JUrXX1ZeofwPwC6fXNxPZfGjNEChXtt\n\n```\nWe can check the account’s balance by browsing various mining pool sites:\n\n### F2Pool\n\nSnapshot of the wallet’s balance on 2021-09-14\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the current exchange rate of XMR-USD, the total XMR amount equals 4,060 USD.
