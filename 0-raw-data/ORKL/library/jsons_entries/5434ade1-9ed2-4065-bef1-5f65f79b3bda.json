Dive into the top threat actors, attack vectors, and threat intelligence trends of 2014.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Intro:\n\n\nAt CrowdStrike, “Intelligence powers everything we do.” This is not a corporate slogan,\n\nand it is not a marketing theme. It is the realization of having the most dedicated\n\nprofessionals focusing on solving problems that have real strategic, political, and\n\nfinancial impact on our customers. When we consider the problems facing our\n\ncustomers, we know that intelligence allows them to make key decisions that can mean\n\nthe difference between disaster and triumph.\n\nIn the earliest days building CrowdStrike, we drew heavily on the concepts\n\nencompassed in Colonel John Boyd’s OODA loop (OODA is an acronym for Observe,\n\nOrient, Decide, Act). It has been applied over the years to all manner of decision-making\n\nsituations. The core of the OODA model is that a decision-making process is broken into\n\nphases, and in an adversarial encounter, two entities will go through the same process.\n\nWhichever entity goes through the process the fastest will likely prevail.\n\nThe reason that intelligence powers everything we do is that we seek to provide our\n\ncustomers with the ability to come to a decision (the last step of the OODA loop)\n\nbefore the adversary does, thus ensuring a favorable outcome. In intelligence circles,\n\nthis is often referred to as decision advantage, and when dealing with adversaries trying\n\nto compromise your enterprise security, you want it.\n\nThroughout 2014, the activity monitored by CrowdStrike in the cyber domain was\n\nreflective of the events unfolding in the real world. This was punctuated in late 2014\n\nwith the now-infamous attack attributed to North Korean actors who levied destructive\n\nmalware in a flagrant assault against a private entity. The actor in this case, which\n\nCrowdStrike has traced back to 2006, has a history of using destructive code against its\n\ntargets. This actor again launched attacks in December against its usual adversary, the\n\nRepublic of Korea.\n\nThe highly publicized events that initially suppressed the release of a movie deemed\n\noffensive by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea resulted in unprecedented\n\nawareness of the power that one adversary can wield against a target if they are\n\nsuitably motivated.\n\nThis final chapter in 2014 closed out what was a year of attribution and adversary\n\nfocus. In May, the U.S. Department of Justice, in concert with various partners including\n\nCrowdStrike researchers, disrupted the infrastructure of Gameover Zeus, a prolific\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Intro:\n\n\nbotnet that was the scourge of security practitioners across the globe. This disruption,\n\nwhich also impacted the nefarious CryptoLocker malware, provided the pause in\n\nadversary activity needed by law enforcement to levy charges and take legal action to\n\npermanently impact this malware.\n\nIn that same month, the U.S. Department of Justice charged five officers in the\n\nPeople’s Liberation Army, the military organ of the People’s Republic of China, with\n\nviolating 18 U.S. Code § 1030. In June, CrowdStrike published a detailed analysis of\n\nan actor associated with the 12th Bureau of the Third General Staff Department. This\n\nreport demonstrated a direct lineage between malware targeting a variety of western\n\ntechnology and government targets, and an individual in the Chinese intelligence service.\n\nThe events that unfolded in the South China Sea near the Paracel Islands, the\n\nemergence of ISIS, the unrest in Ukraine, and the disappearance of a Malaysian airliner\n\nall took on a cyber element. This is no coincidence. The nation-states of the world are\n\nall seeking the aforementioned decision advantage, and they know that the use of\n\ninterconnected computers allows them to collect intelligence that gives them the ability\n\nto make informed decisions.\n\nOur customers rely on us to provide them intelligence to thwart these attacks and make\n\ninformed decisions. This report will provide an overview of some of the intelligence\n\nanalyzed by the CrowdStrike team over the past year.\n\nWrapping so much analysis into one report means a lot of tough decisions needed to\n\nbe made on what to include. This report is structured to provide Key Findings first.\n\nFollowing the key findings are some graph data based on the patterns that emerged\n\nthough visibility attained by the CrowdStrike team; this is meant to provide a snapshot\n\nof the dozens of adversaries tracked this year. In the Notable Activity section, we cover\n\nthe three motivations that we see: Criminal, Targeted-Intrusion, and Hacktivist/Activist.\n\nWe explore notable activity around zero-day exploits and event-specific operations\n\nconducted by these adversaries.\n\nThere are so many interesting actors we discovered this year, and even more that\n\nadvanced from previous years; the Know the Adversary section contains interesting\n\nobservations for just a few of the adversaries from the intelligence reports we\n\npublish through the subscription service. Finally, we provide an analysis of the\n\n2013 report predictions for the past year, and a forecast of what to expect in 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Key Findings\n\n###### In 2014, it became abundantly clear that threat intelligence would provide the decisive advantage when protecting your network.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n\n\n###### • \u0007Financial crime malware disruptions in 2014 changed \n\n the threat landscape by eliminating two prevalent\n\n malware families.\n\n • \u0007Since the high-profile Target breach in 2013, Point\n of-Sale (PoS) malware became prevalent in the targeting\n\n of numerous retail organizations. Look for policy and\n\n process changes to mitigate this threat in 2015.\n\n • \u0007China-based adversaries continued to be the most\n\n prolific in the targeted intrusion space, but public\n\n reporting on a number of actors linked to Iran and \n\n Russia show the breadth of the threat from targeted\n\n intrusion operators.\n\n • \u0007High-profile events continued to drive a significant\n\n number of targeted intrusion campaigns. In 2014,\n\n unpredictable events such as the Malaysia Airlines\n\n incidents and increased unrest in Ukraine drove\n\n campaigns more than planned events such as the \n\n World Cup or the G20 Summit.\n\n • \u0007Malicious activity related to elections in Ukraine and\n\n Hong Kong underscore the threat state-sponsored\n\n adversaries (and possibly hacktivist or nationalist \n\n actors) pose to democratic processes.\n\n • \u0007CrowdStrike reported on a number of new, \n\n sophisticated adversaries from China and Russia such \n\n as HURRICANE PANDA, GOTHIC PANDA, \n\n FANCY BEAR, and BERSERK BEAR.\n\n\n-----\n\n# State of  the Union\n\n###### The CrowdStrike Global Intelligence team observed significant activity from 39 different criminal, hacktivist, state-sponsored, and nationalist adversaries.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## State  of the Union:\n\n\nDuring 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed significant activity from 39\n\nstate-sponsored and nationalist adversaries targeting numerous verticals\n\nall over the globe. The charts below provide a high-level illustration of this\n\ntargeting. There are a few takeaways from this data.\n\nVietnam and GOBLIN PANDA were respectively the most targeted\n\ncountry and the most active adversary. From late spring through summer,\n\nGOBLIN PANDA conducted consistent targeted intrusion operations\n\ntargeting organizations in Vietnam focused on tensions in the South China\n\nSea. These campaigns relied primarily on spear phishing with malicious\n\ndocuments that dropped malware (mostly PlugX) along with Vietnamese\nlanguage decoy documents. The content of these decoys often came from\n\ndocuments produced by Vietnam’s government, which indicates that the\n\nadversary possibly infiltrated the government’s network and was using\n\nstolen documents in its operations. The frequency of GOBLIN PANDA’s\n\noperations, and targeted activity aimed at Vietnam in general, tailed off in\n\n\n-----\n\n###### t w o t h o u s a n d f o u r t e e n\n CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n                                                  - Vietnam\n\n                                                  - United States\n\n## State  ■ India\n\n                                                  - Russia\n\n                                                  - Phillippines\n\n                                                  - Taiwan\n\n                                                  - Tibet\n\n## of the ■ japan\n\n                                                  - France\n\n                                                  - viceroy tiger\n\n                                                  - Myanmar\n\n                                                  - Thailand\n\n                                                  - UK\n\n## Union:\n\n                                                  - South Korea\n\n                                                  - Mongolia\n\n                                                  - Saudi arabia\n\n                                                  - turkey\n\n                                                  - Maldives\n\n                                                  - pakistan\n\n                                                                          - iran\n\n                                                  - Germany\n\n                                                  - laos\n\n                                                  - brazil\n\n                                                  - Canada\n\n                                                  - australia\n\n###### Significant Targeting by Country in 2014\n\nPlugX was by far the most used malware variant for targeted activity\n\nduring 2014. It proliferated greatly amongst China-based targeted intrusion\n\nadversaries and now appears to be the tool of choice for many. The\n\nmalware has been around for years and has been used by multiple Chinese\n\nactors for quite some time; however, the frequency of PlugX use during\n\n2014 revealed just how prominent it is.\n\nPlugX is used by both more advanced China-based adversaries such as\n\nAURORA PANDA and adversaries of a lower level of sophistication such\n\nas GOBLIN PANDA. The reason for its prevalence is not clear. It is possible\n\nthat there is a central malware dissemination channel supplying many\n\nChinese adversaries and this is why so many groups are now using it. It is\n\nalso possible that groups not using it in the past were more recently able\n\nto obtain it via the underground or public malware repositories.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## State  of the Union:\n\n\nThe stats below also reflect a wide range of other malicious cyber activity\n\nassociated with numerous other events. The conflict in Ukraine resulted in\n\ntargeted intrusion and other activity from both Russia-based and China\nbased adversaries. Adversaries with a nexus to Iran were also very active in\n\n2014 targeting western government entities as well as private organizations,\n\nparticularly in the defense sector. Elections were also heavily targeted in\n\n2014 both in Ukraine and in Hong Kong, where the Umbrella Revolution\n\ngarnered a great deal of attention from Chinese actors. These and a number\n\nof other topics are covered in more detail in the sections below.\n\n                         - PlugX                         - quarian\n\n                         - enfal                         - Mirage\n\n                         - Lingbo                         - medusa\n\n                         - Poison Ivy                         - 9blog\n\n                         - Syndicasec                         - httpbrowser\n\n                         - EvilGrab                         - superman\n\n                         - Naikon                         - Mad hatter\n\n                         - Net traveler                         - sykipot\n\n                         - Elise                         - derusbi\n\n                         - Sakula                         - taidoor\n\n                         - pirpi                         - preshin\n\n\n-----\n\n# Notable  Activity\n\n###### Financial crime malware changed the threat landscape, point-of- sale malware became increasingly prevalent, and China-based adversaries continued to proliferate in the targeted intrusion space.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\n###### Criminal Cybercrime Trends in 2014\n\n 2014 was an extremely active year for cybercrime. Financial Trojans grew in both complexity and penetration. Two major banking botnets – Gameover Zeus (GOZ) and Shylock – dominated the first half of the year. Their development focused on the ability to deliver complex web injection scripts used to overcome two-factor authentication and online banking security.\n\nTwo large, successful disruptions were mounted mid-year with CrowdStrike\n\nassisting in a June takeover of GOZ (see the next section), and in Shylock being\n\ntaken down in July. For some time, this left a void in this space, but adversaries\n\nwere very quick to adapt. With many services that catered to GOZ and Shylock\n\nstill in operation, it was inevitable other botnets would step up to the plate.\n\nCrowdStrike is now observing two new major contenders in this space:\n\nDyreza and Dridex, also known as Bugat. Dyreza takes a more simplistic\n\napproach to banking fraud, acting to intercept logins and perform malicious\n\nactions by acquiring the HTTP POST data from under banking SSL sessions.\n\nDridex uses the classic banking Trojan tactic of relying on complex JavaScript\n\nweb injects targeted at the institutions it wishes to steal from. Both threats\n\nrely on the same criminal ecosystem as their predecessors.\n\nUpatre, a loader previously used for delivering GOZ, is now being used to\n\ndeliver Dyreza, and known loaders such as Andromeda, Smoke Loader,\n\nand Pony Loader continue to be developed in order to deliver these\n\nprimary payloads. The Cutwail and Pushdo botnets, previously tasked with\n\ndistributing loaders for GOZ, have since been retasked, and, alongside other\n\nspamming botnets, are now delivering a number of phishing lures that\n\nultimately lead to the infection with persistent payloads. Dridex, for\n\nexample, favors Word documents with obfuscated macros. These macros,\n\nif allowed to execute, will reach out and download first-stage loaders that will\n\nthen install the Dridex payload onto the victim machine.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nIn addition to the changing banking Trojan landscape, ransomware has also\n\nundergone a major shift throughout 2014 — in particular becoming much\n\nmore professionally organized. CryptoLocker’s success made it the first\n\nransomware variant to make it into prime-time news. Its success was, in part,\n\ndue to its wide distribution, acting as an alternative revenue stream for the\n\noperators of GOZ. When GOZ was dismantled, CryptoLocker was also taken\n\ndown, but now in its place many other copycat ransomware families are\n\ntrying to replicate its success, such as CryptoWall and TorrentLocker.\n\nSo what is to be expected for the cybercrime landscape of 2015?\n\nCrowdStrike predicts the continuation of development in banking Trojans\n\nsuch as Dyreza and Dridex. As recently as November, Dridex has added\n\nPeer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality to its arsenal in an attempt to become\n\nmore resilient, and it is likely changes in its capability will continue. In\n\naddition, it is likely new threats will follow the business model of using of\n\nphishing lures delivered by spambots using a range of first-stage loaders to\n\nkeep their primary payloads under the radar. Ransomware will continue to\n\nbecome more of a threat as continued copycats try to develop the\n\nnext market leader.\n\n###### Gameover Zeus Takedown\n\nGameover Zeus (GOZ) was a complex P2P botnet that has been one of the\n\nmost prevalent cyber threats for almost four years. It was forked off the\n\ninfamous Zeus Trojan, the source code of which was leaked in spring 2011 –\n\njust a few months before the appearance of the first GOZ version. GOZ was\n\nlargely used for banking fraud and the delivery of other malware, such as the\n\nCryptoLocker ransomware Trojan, and is believed to have caused more than\n\n$100 million in financial damage.\n\nThe GOZ botnet was long believed to be resistant to any takedown attempts\n\nbecause of its complex, tiered infrastructure: Infected machines form a\n\ndecentralized P2P network, with some peers acting as proxy nodes (brokers\n\nbetween bots and the next tier). This upper tier, again, consists of proxies\n\nthat conceal the location of the actual back end. The use of P2P technology\n\neliminates static rendezvous points and allows the botnet operators to\n\nannounce new centralized components at any time, which makes any\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nefforts against them pointless. On top of this, a fallback mechanism\n\ngenerates a weekly-changing, deterministic set of 1,000 domain names\n\nthat the botmaster can register in order to serve fresh peer lists. Bots that\n\nfail to establish contact with the P2P network would consult the Domain\n\nGeneration Algorithm (DGA) in order to retrieve a new set of peers. Finally,\n\nall communication in the botnet is encrypted.\n\nIn June 2014, the botnet was disrupted in a coordinated effort called\n\nOperation Tovar that was the culmination of months of technical\n\ninvestigation and legal wrangling. The botnet was disrupted by the taking\n\nover of its infrastructure and at the same time preventing access by the\n\nbotmasters. While this effort had to take into account and block all different\n\ncommunication channels, it was primarily focused on the P2P network,\n\nas it was the most complex component. By propagating specially crafted\n\nmessages in the botnet, its infrastructure was degenerated and bots were\n\nredirected to sinkholes.\n\nThe CrowdStrike Intelligence team provided technical expertise to permit\n\nthe enforcement of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), which successfully\n\ndisrupted not only the infamous Gameover Zeus botnet, but also\n\nCryptoLocker. In addition to the technical disruption, the U.S. Department of\n\nJustice filed an indictment against an individual called Evgeniy Mikhailovich\n\nBogachev, who is believed to be behind the GOZ botnet, as well as several\n\nother unnamed co-conspirators.\n\n###### Point-of-Sale Malware and Related Intrusions\n\nCredit card fraud has traditionally been popular in the cybercrime scene.\n\nIn cases where credit card data is stolen through website breaches, the\n\nexposed data usually consists of the card numbers, expiration dates,\n\ncardholder names, and card security codes. However, with this data\n\nalone, it is not always possible to accurately recreate what can be found\n\non a card’s magnetic strip. In the criminal marketplace, card track data is\n\ntherefore generally more highly valued than the information mentioned\n\nabove because it can be used in multiple ways, including manufacturing\n\ncounterfeit credit cards.\n\nThroughout 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence investigated several large\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nbreaches of U.S. companies in the retail sector. These breaches involved\n\ntargeting of Point-of-Sale (PoS) terminals in order to plunder consumer\n\ncredit card information. By infecting terminals with malware specifically\n\ndesigned to steal credit card information as the cards are swiped by\n\ncustomers, attackers were able to collect data for hundreds of thousands of\n\ncredit cards. Running in the background of a terminal, the malware would\n\ncontinuously scan memory for unique patterns found on a card’s magnetic\n\nstrip and exfiltrate matching data to an adversary-controlled server.\n\n\n**Major Payment System Breachs of 2014**\n\n**Michaels**\n\n**Notifies**\n**customers**\n\n**of breach**\n\nTarget Customer\nbreach Tiemframe\n\n**Sally Beauty**\n\n**Notifies**\n**customers**\n\n**of breach**\n\nNOV. dec.

This algorithm, originally developed by\n\nIBM in the 1950s, allows for validation of card numbers by performing an\n\narithmetic operation against them. Despite being developed in the pre\nmodern computing era, the algorithm is still widely used in many modern\n\nsystems including cell phone IMEI numbers, credit card numbers, and\n\nnational identification numbers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\n###### Target Breach\n\nOn 19 December 2013, U.S.-based retailer Target released a statement\n\nconfirming a breach and providing an estimate of the total scope. According\n\nto the statement, the actors were able to steal data for approximately 40\n\nmillion credit cards and up to 70 million individuals’ records with Personally\n\nIdentifiable Information (PII). From reporting about the breach, it is publicly\n\nspeculated that the actors were able to access Target’s network via\n\ncredentials stolen from a Pennsylvania-based HVAC contractor that provided\n\nservices to Target.\n\nIn January 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence analyzed several files from the\n\nincident. One of these files was a PoS malware named Kaptoxa (also known\n\nas mmon), which is used as a component in another PoS malware, BlackPoS.\n\nThis copy of Kaptoxa continuously scanned volatile memory of infected\n\nsystems for patterns that looked like credit card numbers and logged them\n\nto a file that was transferred to an internal network share at regular intervals.\n\nAnother utility was deployed onto these network shares to perform the final\n\nexfiltration step in which the data was transferred to external FTP servers.\n\nIn January 2014, CrowdStrike identified a malware staging site that was\n\nhosting a copy of the BlackPoS source code. While it is believed that this\n\nsite is not linked to the Target breach, analysis of the source code provided\n\nadditional insight into the simplicity of these tools. Compared to other\n\ncrimeware families, most PoS malware is relatively simple in design and\n\nfunctionality. The malware used does not accept tasking from controllers or\n\nexternal systems; its sole function is to scan, log, and exfiltrate data found.\n\nDespite the simplistic nature of these tools, the adversary behind the Target\n\nbreach demonstrated sophisticated tradecraft in mounting a successful\n\noperation, primarily by taking full advantage of the initial stolen credentials\n\nto laterally move throughout the targeted network into the PoS systems.\n\n###### The Rise of Commodity PoS\n\nIn 2014, while several major companies were coping with breaches of their\n\nPoS infrastructure, many smaller retailers were facing the same threat from\n\nless-organized groups. In underground marketplaces, ready-to-use PoS\n\nmalware kits were becoming more commonly available.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nMalware such as BlackPoS requires a bit of strategic planning on the part of\n\nthe adversary; much of the system lacks the point-and-click intuitive nature\n\nof commodity botnets. For less-organized or less-skilled adversary groups,\n\nan off-the-shelf kit such as Dexter PoS may allow for exploitation and\n\noffensive capabilities that may not otherwise be possible.\n\nDexter, which CrowdStrike Intelligence reported on in 2013, became one of\n\nthe most publicly known PoS malware kits on the market. By late 2014, the\n\nsource code for Dexter was publicly available on several criminal forums. The\n\nmalware scans memory for both Track 1 and Track 2 credit card data and\n\nexfiltrates its findings back to control servers over HTTP requests.\n\nDexter offers an adversary a clean, simple control panel, which allows for\n\ninfected host management and viewing of obtained data.\n\nIn 2014, CrowdStrike investigated several other kits similar to Dexter,\n\nincluding vSkimmer and JackPoS, which also focused on stealing credit\n\ncard numbers from infected terminals. Many of these lacked technical\n\nsophistication, but were generally found to be effective in identifying and\n\nexfiltrating any found data.\n\n\n###### Dexter Command- and-Control\n Panel\n\n|Dexter|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n\n###### Dexter\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\n###### State Targeted Intrusion Trends in 2014\n\nIncidents of targeted intrusion activity related to nation-state interests have\n\nbeen on the increase for the past several years. Different states’ activities\n\noften reflect their national interests and agendas, or their deepest concerns.\n\nAs an example, Chinese nation-state actors appeared to clearly align and plan\n\noperations in support of real-world activities in the case of the Haiyang Shiyou\n\n981 oil platform. In direct contradiction to pre-planned operations, in the case\n\nof the Umbrella Revolution that dominated the streets of Hong Kong during\n\nthe summer and fall of 2014, Chinese adversary groups were observed broadly\n\ntargeting any and all organizations related to the civil unrest in a wild attempt\n\nto collect intelligence on the protestors and their movements.\n\nDuring the course of 2014, CrowdStrike observed the continued proliferation\n\nof targeted intrusion activity. Nation-states understand the value of\n\ncollecting intelligence in the information domain and are mobilizing\n\nresources to capitalize on the intelligence opportunities that exist there.\n\nWhile the CrowdStrike Intelligence team identified and analyzed well over a\n\ndozen new adversary groups worldwide in 2014, there were several that were\n\nof general interest.\n\n###### FLYING KITTEN\n\nFLYING KITTEN is an adversary believed to be operating\n\nout of the Islamic Republic of Iran. This group was first\n\nobserved initiating targeted intrusion activity in late 2013\n\nand has continued to be active throughout 2014. In January\n\n2014, CrowdStrike became aware of an ongoing operation by this actor\n\ntargeting a company in the defense industrial base in the United States. This\n\ncampaign leveraged fake websites to trick users into entering credentials,\n\nand to concurrently serve malware that poses as software updates for\n\nlegitimate applications. Shortly after this activity was identified, other\n\ncampaigns against additional targets in the defense and aerospace sectors\n\nwere observed. Evidence supporting the attribution of FLYING KITTEN to\n\nIran is found in their secondary focus, which targets Iranian dissidents in\n\nforeign countries, as well as in Iran itself.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nA common tactic of FLYING KITTEN is to set up spoofed login web pages\n\non domains that closely resemble the legitimate pages used by the targets.\n\nThese fake web pages serve two purposes: They log credentials entered by\n\nusers who believe the page is a legitimate authentication mechanism, and\n\nthen redirect to another page that prompts the download of an alleged\n\npatch or update that is, in fact, a copy of their remote access tool. This tool\n\nis used to log keystrokes, screenshots, and other user activity on infected\n\nsystems and exfiltrates this data to an attacker-controlled server.\n\nThe primary remote access tool used by FLYING KITTEN is a dropper that\n\nis written in C# .NET and generally uses the same filename. The files to be\n\ndropped are stored in .NET resources embedded in the executable. When\n\nexecuted, it extracts and deploys a backdoor Trojan, a configuration file,\n\nand optionally a decoy (an image or a legitimate executable). Likewise, the\n\nbackdoor executable is also written in C#, meaning it can be decompiled\n\nback to a representation of the original source code. This code lists several\n\nclasses with telling names, such as Stealer.Browser, Stealer.Keylogger, or\n\nStealer.Messenger. Further, the code contains transcripts of Farsi language\n\nartifacts, e.g., HavijeBaba and salam!*%#, as shown below.\n\nIn addition to the aerospace/defense and dissident targeting, it appears\n\nthat FLYING KITTEN was also engaged in broader targeting via the website\n\nparmanpower.com that purported to be the website of a business engaged\n\nin recruiting, training, and development in Erbil, Iraq. The Whois record\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nfor this website is the same as for some of the other domains related to\n\nthe activity discussed above, which indicates that it was also in use by this\n\nadversary, but the actual purpose of the website is still unknown.\n\nThe registrant email that currently appears in Whois records for many of\n\nthe observed domains is info@usa.gov.us. However, historical records show\n\nthat the domains were originally registered under the email address keyvan.\n\najaxtm@gmail.com, which ties back to an Iran-based entity called Ajax\n\nSecurity Team. This group has been known for low-level web defacements\n\nand SQL injection attacks for some time. Until early 2014, Ajax Security\n\nhad an easily identifiable presence on the Internet with its own website and\n\nrelated Facebook pages. This Internet presence has decreased significantly,\n\nlikely due to a desire to keep a lower profile now that the group is engaged\n\nin targeted intrusion activity.\n\n###### CHARMING KITTEN\n\nIn late May, public reporting was released about an Iran-based adversary that\n\nleverages fake personas on social networking sites in order to conduct social\n\nengineering and ultimately targeted attacks against desired targets. This\n\nadversary, CHARMING KITTEN, has been known to CrowdStrike Intelligence\n\nsince January 2014, when it was observed targeting individuals in the U.S.\n\ngovernment and defense sectors.\n\nCHARMING KITTEN engaged in both credential collection and malware\n\noperations. Credential collection occurred through spoofed websites meant\n\nto appear as if they were legitimate sites such as YouTube.\n\nWhen victims clicked on the log\n\nin link, they were redirected to a\n\ndifferent website that prompted\n\nthem to enter credentials for\n\nharvesting by the adversary.\n\nThe malware used by this\n\nadversary is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC)-based malware variant referred to\n\nas Parastoo because of the IRC password it uses. This malware possesses\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nan extensive command set capable of conducting reconnaissance of victim\n\nmachines, deleting files, downloading files, and exfiltrating data.\n\nA number of factors support CHARMING KITTEN’s nexus to Iran. First of\n\nall, the “Parastoo” password used by the malware is an Iranian word used\n\nto refer to small birds. Also, the adversary used Iran-based web hosting\n\nproviders and infrastructure to host malicious domains. Finally, one of\n\nthe droppers related to one of the identified Parastoo variants dropped a\n\nPersian-language decoy document purporting to be from Iran’s Ministry of\n\nInterior.\n\n###### PlugX – The Panda’s Tool of Choice\n\nCrowdStrike has observed an upward trend in the use of PlugX Remote\n\nAccess Tool (RAT) malware during 2014. Multiple adversary groups have\n\nused PlugX to target a number of sectors in countries surrounding China’s\n\nsphere of influence, particularly those involved in science & technology,\n\ngovernment, and defense. Further afield, PlugX has been used in persistent\n\ncampaigns against commercial entities in the United States, as well as to\n\ntarget organizations involved in counter-terrorism or other political\n\nefforts worldwide.\n\nAttacks associated with GOBLIN PANDA have been observed at an\n\nincreasing rate throughout the latter half of the year, while in the closing\n\nmonths of 2014 CrowdStrike has investigated several instances of PlugX\n\nactivity consistent with the HURRICANE PANDA and PALE PANDA\n\nadversaries. Other China-based adversaries observed using PlugX in their\n\noperations include AURORA PANDA, NIGHTSHADE PANDA, PREDATOR\n\nPANDA, EMISSARY PANDA, and WET PANDA. The upward trend in use of\n\nPlugX indicates an increasing confidence in the capabilities of the platform,\n\njustifying its continued use across multiple sectors and countries.\n\nPlugX has existed in some form since 2008 and has evolved over time to\n\noffer new capabilities and control mechanisms, supported by an active\n\ndevelopment program. It provides an attacker with a range of functionality\n\nincluding the ability to log keystrokes; modify and copy files; capture\n\nscreenshots or video of user activity; and perform administrative tasks such\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nas terminating processes, logging off users, and rebooting victim machines.\n\nA full command shell is also provided through access to a cmd.exe process,\n\nwhich sends output to the PlugX instance over named pipes for onward relay\n\nto the attacker’s Command-and-Control (C2) servers.\n\nWhile these capabilities are not unusual for a RAT and are comparable to\n\nthose provided by Poison Ivy and other tools, PlugX also offers a range of C2\n\nprotocols and execution options that help reduce the risk of being detected\n\nby network defenders. Over time, these capabilities have been augmented\n\nwith additional releases of versions and plugins, which have in turn been\n\ndeployed by adversaries in active and ongoing campaigns. For example,\n\nGOBLIN PANDA has been observed using PlugX with internal version\n\nnumbers of 20140101 in campaigns since Q2 2014, migrating to deployments\n\nof 20140606 versions in the second half of the year.\n\nPlugX is most frequently delivered to targets via a spear phishing attack\n\ncontaining a malicious RTF or Word document leveraging exploit code\n\nfor the popular CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability. Some adversary groups also\n\nattempted to leverage the CVE-2014-1761 vulnerability as a way to maximize\n\nthe chance of exploitation against more recently patched systems, with\n\nvarying degrees of success.\n\nAttacks have also been identified using PowerPoint and Excel file formats, as\n\nwell as self-extracting RAR files and plain executables as email attachments.\n\nHowever PlugX is installed on a victim machine, typically three files are\n\ndropped on the file system after exploitation to enable initial start-up of\n\nthe malware: a legitimate, digitally signed application; an encrypted file\n\ncontaining the PlugX payload; and a malicious, dynamically-linked library\n\nthat is used to load the malware using the Dynamic Link Library (DLL)\n\nside-loading technique when the legitimate application is executed. This\n\nmethodology can provide a level of protection against some threat detection\n\ntechniques employed by anti-virus software packages, as the parent process\n\nis a non-malicious executable. Often, a computer security tool such as a\n\ncomponent of a commercial anti-virus application is used for this purpose,\n\nlikely to take advantage of any process whitelisting strategies that may be in\n\nplace on a network.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nCommand and control of PlugX malware is facilitated using a range of\n\nprotocols including HTTP and a binary channel over ICMP. During 2014,\n\nCrowdStrike observed an increased use of a newer DNS C2 module that\n\ntransmits data as lengthy DNS queries to adversary-controlled infrastructure.\n\nWhile this mechanism deviates from some of the more typically monitored\n\nprotocols, the verbosity of communication using this module may provide\n\nopportunities for detection through proactive analysis of such traffic leaving\n\na network.\n\nFurther demonstrating the continued development of this platform,\n\nCrowdStrike observed modifications to HTTP and DNS requests produced by\n\nPlugX throughout the year, presenting an adapting challenge for detection\n\nof this threat. However, while some adversary groups have registered\n\ndomains over the course of 2014 for use in PlugX C2 (e.g., proxyme.net),\n\nthere has been a continued use of domain names that have been active for\n\na number of years, indicating the effectiveness of this infrastructure over\n\nextended periods of time.\n\nThe ongoing development of PlugX provides attackers with a flexible\n\ncapability that requires continued vigilance on the part of network defenders\n\nin order to detect it reliably. There is currently no clear evidence to suggest\n\nthat use of PlugX has proliferated to adversaries attributed outside of China;\n\nan increase in its deployment over the last year could be a precursor to\n\nfuture worldwide use, particularly as PlugX succeeds legacy capabilities such\n\nas Poison Ivy as an adversary tool of choice.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\n###### Hacktivist/Nationalist\n\nHacktivist- and nationalist-motivated cyber actors are a third class of\n\nadversary tracked by the CrowdStrike Intelligence team. The goals of these\n\nactors may range from causing mischief for laughs to influencing opinions\n\nor views about a particular issue. During the course of 2014, there were a\n\nfew notable events that demonstrate the capabilities of these actors. As\n\nelectronic voting continues to be used by more and more countries, the\n\ntargeting of such processes and equipment will continue to expand.\n\n###### Operations Targeting Elections\n\nIn July 2014, the electronic voter registration system for the then\nupcoming Tunisian presidential election suffered a cyber attack, rendering\n\nregistrations impossible for an unknown amount of time. Sources reported\n\nthat the authorities had control over the attack and that it was a systematic\n\nprocess, intended to strike the electoral process. This incident is yet another\n\nexample of cyber attacks targeting electronic voting systems to\n\nmanipulate an outcome.\n\n###### CyberBerkut\n\nIn February 2014, several bloody protests took place in Ukraine resulting\n\nin the ousting of the pro-Russia prime minister, and an interim government\n\nwas created with the goal of creating closer ties with the European Union\n\n(EU). Following the protests, CyberBerkut, a self-proclaimed nationalistic\n\nhacking group, began taking credit for hacks against Ukrainian interim\n\nleaders. The group was extremely proactive about distributing propaganda\n\ndecrying the new government and recruiting pro-Russia supporters to\n\nengage in participatory Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against\n\na multitude of Ukrainian government and media sites. These attacks were\n\nlikely directed by Russian state services, with the CyberBerkut hacktivists\n\nproviding a layer of plausible deniability.\n\nSeveral of the DDoS attacks against Ukraine’s Central Election Commission\n\n(CEC) coincided with Russian state media broadcasts, further suggesting\n\ncoordination at the state level. In one case, an attack on the CEC occurred\n\naround the time the election results were supposed to appear, while a\n\nsimultaneous broadcast on Russian state media appeared to show false\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nresults where an extremist candidate won the election by a hefty margin.\n\nThe goal of the operation was likely to cause temporary confusion over\n\nthe immediate results of the election and to cause observers to question\n\nthe legitimacy of the elections, which were touted as being fair and well\n\nequipped to withstand attacks. Had the operation been successful, it likely\n\nwould have incited unrest in Ukraine and supported the Russian narrative\n\nthat the elections were illegitimate and that Russian intervention was needed\n\nto prevent Ukraine from slipping into complete chaos.\n\nWhereas previous conflicts between Russia and former Soviet states\n\nEstonia and Georgia saw a much heavier use of cyber tactics used to bring\n\ndown critical infrastructure and disrupt communications, the efforts against\n\nUkraine appeared muted and designed more for a disinformation campaign\n\nto stir unrest in order for Russia to intervene in Ukraine in a “peacekeeper”\n\nrole as it did in Crimea. The widespread publicity the conflict received in\n\nglobal media along with the threat of heavy sanctions imposed by the west\n\nmay have been a factor in preventing more aggressive cyber\n\naction from Russia.\n\nAlthough the campaign appeared to be ultimately unsuccessful, partly due\n\nto a prepared Ukrainian defense, CrowdStrike noted several interesting\n\nobservations. Though the use of a proxy to carry out attacks for the\n\npurposes of plausible deniability is hardly new, the coordination of the\n\npropaganda distributed and Russian media reporting was particularly\n\ntelling with regard to how Russian state services can direct many moving\n\nparts in unison to achieve their goals via cyber means. In addition, the\n\nparticipatory DDoS client software CyberBerkut advertised to help launch\n\nDDoS attacks against the Ukrainian government actually installed a\n\nbackdoor on victims’ machines, presumably enabling Russian intelligence\n\nservices to make a new botnet out of the compromised “volunteers”, which\n\ncould be used in future conflicts.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence also investigated targeted attacks by CyberBerkut\n\nagainst Ukrainian organizations and entities operating or doing business\n\nin Ukraine. CyberBerkut was first observed in March 2014 when it made\n\nstatements about the illegitimacy of the government that took over Ukraine\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nupon the ousting of former president,\n\nViktor Yanukovych. Around this same\n\ntime, the group launched DDoS attacks\n\nagainst state-controlled media in the\n\ncountry as well as against NATO entities\n\nsuch as the Cooperative Cyber Defense\n\nCenter of Excellence (CCDCOE). In April,\n\nCyberBerkut claimed responsibility for\n\ndefacing the websites of several private\n\nmilitary companies – Greystone, Triple\n\nCanopy, and Academi – that they claimed\n\nwere operating on the ground in Ukraine.\n\n\nCyberBerkut’s operations during 2014 were very much in line with the\n\npriorities of the Russian state; however, it is unclear if its activity is directly\n\nstate sponsored or if it is an independent group carrying out attacks\n\nmotivated by Russian nationalistic ideals.\n\n###### Umbrella Revolution\n\nFirst observed in late 2013, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) steadily\n\nincreased the use of its intelligence services and cyber operations in Hong\n\nKong as part of a response to the protests supporting universal suffrage and\n\ndemocracy headed by Occupy Central (和平占中). The Hong Kong protests\n\nfueled fears in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which perceives them\n\nas a threat to its one-party rule in mainland China. This perceived threat\n\nlikely prompted the flurry of malicious cyber activity taken against various\n\norganizations and citizens operating in support of the protests within Hong\n\nKong, later dubbed the Umbrella Revolution.\n\nThe methods used were a smattering of cyber tactics and human intelligence\n\n(HUMINT) methods to collect information about leaders of the Occupy\n\nCentral Movement and locations of its supporters, as well as to gain an\n\noverall picture of Hong Kong citizens’ perception of the protests. This began\n\nwith strategic web compromises of key websites associated with Occupy\n\nCentral in late 2013, followed by extensive HUMINT activities carried out\n\nin early 2014 by suspected Ministry of State Security (MSS) officers likely\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\ndesigned to elicit information from influential figures in Hong Kong and\n\npressure them to support Beijing’s stance in exchange for gifts.\n\nThe protests reached a critical point when a democratic online referendum\n\nwas held in June 2014 calling for open elections of Hong Kong’s chief\n\nexecutive. At the peak of voting, the online hosting system, Popvote\n\n(which at one point exceeded 500 gbps of traffic), suffered a massive\n\nDDoS attack. The attackers were persistent and scaled their attacks as\n\ndefenders responded to the attack, starting with Layer 3 and 4 attacks and\n\nprogressively using more advanced Layer 7 attacks. Though the voting\n\nsystem did persist and drew more than 780,000 votes, the apparent effort\n\nthe PRC went through to down the referendum was substantial.\n\nAs the protests persisted, the PRC appeared to increase its attempts to\n\nmonitor the protestors by proliferating mobile malware for both the Android\n\nand iOS operating systems. The mobile Remote Access Tools (mRATs) were\n\nauthored by two individuals with extensive ties to legacy Chinese hackers\n\nand were likely contracted out to customize malware for the purpose of\n\nmonitoring protestors’ communications and physical locations.\n\nIn addition to these specialized attacks and extensive censorship of the\n\nUmbrella Revolution in mainland China, the PRC appears to have taken\n\na shotgun approach to handling the protests as they persisted. Several\n\nknown China-based groups including MAVERICK PANDA, VIXEN PANDA,\n\nTEMPER PANDA, SABRE PANDA, and HURRICANE PANDA were observed\n\nparticipating in activity related to the protests, suggesting a possible cross\ndivisional tasking as the CCP saw support for the protests increase. This\n\ndemonstrates the variety of approaches China has when dealing with a\n\nthreat to the CCP’s one-party rule. Along with the mobile targeting of most\n\nof the citizens of Hong Kong, it shows a new level of brazenness that is\n\nbecoming increasingly common in Chinese cyber operations.\n\n###### LizardSquad/DerpTrolling DerpTrolling\n\nThe hacking collective DerpTrolling made early 2014 media headlines\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nafter claiming a string of DDoS attacks on multiple gaming companies\n\nand online gaming servers. The group likely originated out of the Steam\n\ngaming community, where some of its suspected members engaged in early\n\nDDoS attacks on rival gaming clans and their servers. DerpTrolling’s antics\n\nwere often childish and had no clear motive other than being “for the lulz”\n\nand to boost their own egos. For this reason, they cannot be classified as\n\nhacktivists. Despite their immaturity, the collective was able to consistently\n\ncarry out DDoS attacks on targets of their choosing, and these attacks had a\n\nreal-world effect on the victims within the gaming community.\n\nThe attacks were particularly noteworthy as their DDoS tool, dubbed the\n\nGaben Laser Beam (GLB) after Gabe Newell, the creator of Half-Life and\n\nthe Steam community, supposedly created an attack that exceeded 400\n\ngbps of network traffic utilizing a NTP reflection attack. This suggested\n\nDerpTrolling possessed an above-average knowledge of network protocols.\n\nWhile NTP reflection is commonly known in the security community, most\n\n“script kiddies” or “skids” were not aware of some of these more advanced\n\ntechniques involving amplification, which allows for fewer devices needed to\n\npull off larger DDoS attacks.\n\nDerpTrolling has reportedly had several run-ins with law enforcement,\n\nthough it is unclear how much of this is verifiable versus a ploy to increase\n\ntheir notoriety. One supposed encounter resulted in the group going silent\n\nfor several months before returning and carrying out lower-level attacks on\n\nthe gaming community once again. Given the collective’s poor operational\n\nsecurity practices, it is likely that the members are actively being tracked by\n\nlaw enforcement agencies and that they cannot continue to maintain high\nprofile attacks while evading capture.\n\n###### LizardSquad\n\nAnother group to begin DDoS operations targeting the gaming community\n\nin 2014 is LizardSquad. The group was characterized by DerpTrolling\n\nas much less skilled, however there may be some overlap of members\n\nbetween the groups. At this time, LizardSquad has not shown any of the\n\nmore advanced amplification techniques used previously by DerpTrolling.\n\nLizardSquad quickly rose to prominence after several media stunts drew\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n1 “Syrian Electronic Army hacks several\nwebsites, Forbes, Ferrari, Independent, Daily\nTelegraph and many other websites hijacked”,\n27 November 2014, http://www.techworm.\nnet/2014/11/syrian-electronic-army-hacks-several-websites-forbes-ferrari-independent-daily-telegraph-many-websites-hijacked.html\n2 “Syrian Electronic Army hacks International\nBusiness Times (IBT) for alleged false coverage\nof Syria”, 18 December 2014, http://www.\ntechworm.net/2014/12/syrian-electronic-army-hacks-international-business-times.html\n3 See “The Syrian Army is Shrinking, and\nAssad is Running Out of Soldiers”,\n17 December 2014, http://www.ibtimes.com/\nsyrian-army-shrinking-assadrunning-out-soldiers-1761914\n\n\nsignificant attention from the press as well as law enforcement. LizardSquad\n\nnot only began claiming to be affiliates of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria\n\n(ISIS), but also called in a bomb threat, grounding a flight on which a Sony\n\nOnline Entertainment executive was a passenger. Though the group appears\n\nto have no terrorist ties, their antics quickly gained them notoriety.\n\nLizardSquad has even poorer operational security practices than\n\nDerpTrolling, which allowed CrowdStrike to easily provide attribution on\n\npossible members of the group. In addition, the group also admitted to\n\nrenting botnets and running booters, confirming that their skill level is\n\nrelatively low. Despite this, the threat they posed to gaming companies was\n\nstill noteworthy, especially when combined with terrorist threats; although\n\nthey were bluster, they still had considerable real-world consequences.\n\n###### DEADEYE JACKAL: Far From Dead\n\nAlthough DEADEYE JACKAL doesn’t have the kind\n\nof coverage it once had in the media around its high\nprofile hacks, the group is still active. It still conducts the\n\noccasional mass defacements and is focusing on improving\n\nand strengthening its dissemination pathways, including migrating to more\n\nprivate social media and adding a mobile site and Android app. DEADEYE\n\nJACKAL even developed and released its own Linux-based operating\n\nsystem, called SEANux, at the end of October 2014.\n\nDEADEYE JACKAL continues its international censorship of online articles\n\nthat it deems detrimental to Syria or to Syrian President Bashar Assad. On\n\nThanksgiving, the group defaced just over 60 websites, including media\n\nwebsites.[1] The websites were primarily from the United States and the United\n\nKingdom but also included Japan, Canada, the Philippines, New Zealand,\n\nMexico, and South Africa. A message on DEADEYE JACKAL’s Twitter\n\naccount showed possible motivations outside of opportunistic targeting,\n\nsaying “The press: Please don’t pretend #ISIS are civilians”.\n\nThe most recent cyber attack by DEADEYE JACKAL was on 18 December\n\n2014, when the group hacked the website of the International Business\n\nTimes to remove an article due to its coverage of Syria, which DEADEYE\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n4 http://vk.com/syrianelectronicarmy\n5 https://ello.co/syrianelectronicarmy\n6 https://www.pinterest.com/officialsea/\n7 http://instagram.com/official_sea2\n8 https://www.youtube.com/user/SEAOfficialChannel\n9 https://twitter.com/official_sea16\n10 http://sea.sy/rss/en\n\n\nJACKAL perceived as false.[2] The deleted article discussed depleting military\n\nresources of President Assad, in terms of soldiers, since the start of the U.S.\n\ncampaign in Syria against the Islamic State. The article, however, was soon\n\nreposted by the International Business Times and remains available.[3]\n\nDEADEYE JACKAL used to be limited to operating through its website,\n\nTwitter account, and Facebook account, which proved problematic in some\n\nways since their communications could be terminated more easily when\n\nTwitter or Facebook decided to shut down their accounts. It became a joke\n\nto DEADEYE JACKAL how many Facebook pages it could start up that\n\nwould be shut down. However, DEADEYE JACKAL did realize that more\n\nstable and varied dissemination pathways for their messaging were needed.\n\nAdditionally, the group decided it also needed communications that would\n\nhave less chance of being monitored by its enemies.\n\nIn September 2013, DEADEYE JACKAL changed its email provider from\n\nGmail to Mail.ru. The change was likely a result of suspicions that their emails\n\nwere being monitored in light of the leaks made by Edward Snowden earlier\n\nin 2013. In other moves to protect privacy, DEADEYE JACKAL opened up\n\naccounts with VK, formerly VKontakte[4] (the Russia-based social media\n\nwebsite similar to Facebook owned by Mail.ru Group and Ello[5]), a new\n\nsocial media website that boasts that it does not sell ads or its users’ data\n\nto advertisers. It also does not allow any data mining against the users of\n\nits site. DEADEYE JACKAL also launched a mobile site for its website and\n\nan Android app. These are all in addition to the group’s already-established\n\naccounts on Pinterest[6], Instagram[7], YouTube[8], and Twitter[9].\n\nMost notably, the group developed and released its own operating system,\n\ncalled SEANux. SEANux offers little overall improvement over other Linux\nbased systems like Kali or BackTrack. SEANux automatically loads a desktop\n\nsystem monitor that makes several network requests, creating a sidebar. The\n\nsidebar provides the user information about the system, running processes,\n\nweather (Damascus, DI, Syria), currency rates, and some other high-level\n\ninformation. Also on this side bar is a small window with a feed of news from\n\nDEADEYE JACKAL’s website[10].\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nThe most notable aspect of SEANux is the tools it offers. SEANux offers\n\nsome standard offensive/pentesting tools, including Metasploit Framework,\n\nSQLMap, nMap, Aircrack, and John the Ripper. There is also an included\n\ndirectory with other miscellaneous PHP and Perl scripts, however most of\n\nthese do not appear to be created by DEADEYE JACKAL.\n\n###### SEANux also offers a custom set of offensive/pentesting tools including:\n\n**• SEA SHELL - A basic web shell.**\n\n**• \u0007UPLOADER - A web application for uploading files to the system where the**\n\nweb app is hosted.\n\n**• \u0007MYSQL EXECUTOR - A web application for executing commands on local**\n\nand remote MySQL servers.\n\n**• \u0007JOOMLA & WORDPRESS SCANNER - A web application for checking**\n\nwhether a remote system is running WordPress or Joomla.\n\n- \u0007EXECUTER - A very rudimentary webshell for executing system\n\ncommands where the web app is hosted.\n\n**• \u0007DDOS ATTACKER - A basic DDoS web application. The adversary**\n\nspecifies an IP address they want to flood with TCP or UDP traffic.\n\n**• \u0007WORDPRESS BRUTE FORCE ATTACKER - A web application for**\n\npreforming simple brute force attack against a WordPress site.\n\n**• \u0007JOOMLA BRUTE FORCE ATTACKER - A web application for**\n\npreforming simple brute force against Joomla sites.\n\n**• \u0007WEB SCANNER - A web application for scanning a remote web server for**\n\nfiles and folders.\n\n**• \u0007ORACLE QUERY EXECUTOR - A web application for executing commands**\n\non local and remote Oracle database servers.\n\n**• \u0007ACP FINDER - A web application to scan for what are believed to be admin**\n\ncontrol panels.\n\n**• \u0007BACK CONNECTION - A web application for creating a reverse shell**\n\nconnection allowing another computer to control where the app is hosted.\n\n**• \u00075.2.3 SAFEMODE BYPASS / 5.2.11-5.3.0 SAFE MODE BYPASS - Both are**\n\ntools for attempting to bypass some of PHP’s built-in security.\n\nDEADEYE JACKAL has not attempted the ruse that Anonymous did in\n\n2012 when they released Anonymous-OS, which was found to be riddled\n\nwith Trojans. SEANux does connect to some DEADEYE JACKAL-controlled\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nresources such as their RSS feed, images in the webshells, and a Firefox\n\ncustom SEANux homepage. It is possible for DEADEYE JACKAL to monitor\n\nto see who is connecting to these resources, but outside of that, the\n\noperating system functions normally.\n\n###### FRATERNAL JACKAL\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, a four-phased attack known as Operation Ababil, or\n\nOpAbabil, was conducted by a group of Iranian actors targeting U.S. financial\n\ninstitutions with DDoS attacks.\n\nThis adversary, which CrowdStrike tracks under the name FRATERNAL\n\nJACKAL, has been suspected of having ties to the Iranian government. It\n\nhas been known to increase attack volume during periods of economic\n\ntension between Iran and western countries. Despite suspicion of political\n\nmotivations, the group has publicly attested in several Pastebin.com posts\n\nthat the motivation for these attacks are negative depictions of the Muslim\n\nProphet Muhammad in several YouTube videos.\n\nAttacks from this adversary group have been primarily conducted using\n\na botnet of public-facing web servers that have been exploited through\n\nvulnerable Content Management Systems (CMS). Unlike traditional botnets\n\nin which infected hosts connect to control servers for tasking, within\n\nFRATERNAL JACKAL’s botnet, nodes are directly tasked by the adversary\n\nthrough multiple layers of infrastructure.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence continued to actively investigate this adversary\n\nduring 2014, specifically seeking means by which it propagated its botnet.\n\nIn October, a PHP script was identified in connection with this adversary.\n\nThis script is used for scanning lists of domains by parsing each domain’s\n\nrobots.txt file to identify any server running the CMS Joomla. Domains\n\nidentified from this script are directly posted to a hard-coded control server,\n\nsomething not seen previously by CrowdStrike with this adversary’s toolkit.\n\nNormally, performing server reconnaissance by parsing the robots.txt file\n\nof a server is a trivial task. However, when looked at in the context of this\n\nadversary’s strategic operations, it suggests that the adversary is not only\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nusing their first-stage infrastructure for offensive actions against targets, but\n\nalso for further expansion of their botnet.\n\nDespite FRATERNAL JACKAL no longer publicly posting motivations and\n\nnotices of upcoming attacks to Pastebin, their botnet remains online and\n\ncapable of performing attacks. It is likely that in the event of future tensions\n\nbetween Iran and western countries, this group may publicly resurface and\n\ncontinue their attack campaigns.\n\n###### 2014 Zero-Day Activity\n\nThe occurrence of a zero-day, or a previously unknown vulnerability being\n\nexploited in the wild, is generally an unusual occurrence. These events almost\n\nalways tell an interesting story when they are initially discovered. During the\n\ncourse of 2014, there were hundreds of newly identified vulnerabilities that\n\nwere categorized by Mitre under the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\n\n(CVE) system. Many of these were identified by researchers or vendors\n\nthrough auditing and other proactive security reviews.\n\nIn some cases, the vulnerabilities were first identified being used by\n\nadversaries (the development and proliferation of those vulnerabilities are\n\na fascinating component of the threat landscape). There were several such\n\nevents that occurred this year; three are particularly interesting from an\n\nadversary perspective, namely CVE-2014-0322, CVE-2014-4113, and CVE\n2014-1761. There were numerous interesting exploits identified this year,\n\nmany used by various adversaries such as the SSL Heartbleed attack (CVE\n2014-0160) and the ShellShock Bourne Again Shell (BASH) vulnerabilities\n\n(CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-6277, CVE-2014-6278, CVE-2014-7169, CVE\n2014-7186, and CVE-2014-7187). These exploits were not necessarily\n\nexemplary of the related adversary narrative that helps to determine the\n\n“who” behind the attacks that CrowdStrike focuses on from an intelligence\n\nstandpoint.\n\n###### CVE-2014-0322 - Internet Explorer  Arbitrary Code Execution\n\nThis zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer allowed code\n\nexecution via specially crafted JavaScript code, making it ideal for Strategic\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nWeb Compromise (SWC) or drive-by operations. There were two primary\n\ncampaigns associated with CVE-2014-0322.\n\nThe first to be publicly identified occurred in February 2014 and was hosted\n\non the website of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). This incident\n\ndelivered a fairly common, publicly available RAT called ZxShell, which\n\nconnected to a C2 at newss.effers.com. This is a domain that CrowdStrike\n\nassociates with the AURORA PANDA adversary.\n\nInvestigation into the VFW incident led to the discovery of other sites\n\n(savmpet.com, gifas.assso.net, and icbcqsz.com) also hosting this exploit\n\ncode. These sites not only shared the same IP address as each other, but also\n\ncontained the same content that was taken from the website for the French\n\naerospace industries association, Groupement des Industries Françaises\n\nAéronautiques et Spatiales (GIFAS). The dates visible on these webpages\n\nand those dates found in the pages’ source code indicated that they were\n\ncreated on 17 January 2014, which predated the VFW incident by nearly a\n\nmonth. However, this operation utilized drive-by tactics rather than SWC\n\nbecause the sites hosting the code were controlled by the adversary and not\n\ncompromised legitimate sites.\n\nThe GIFAS-related activity delivered a different malware payload (Sakula)\n\nthan the VFW incident (ZxShell). The Sakula payload communicated with\n\nan entirely different C2 infrastructure than the ZxShell, oa.ameteksen.com.\n\nThis indicates that a different adversary was responsible for the GIFAS\nrelated SWC operation. Further investigation into this activity showed a\n\nnumber of similarities to a 2012 zero-day (CVE-2012-4792) SWC campaign\n\nthat leveraged the website of a U.S.-based manufacturer, Capstone Turbine.\n\nThese similarities were: the use of Sakula malware, GIFAS-based subdomains\n\nrelated to both incidents, and the use of zero-day vulnerabilities. At the end\n\nof 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence also discovered potential links between this\n\nadversary and its HURRICANE PANDA adversary (discussed in more detail\n\nbelow); however, evaluation of these connections is still ongoing.\n\n###### CVE-2014-4113 – Local Privilege Escalation\n\nEvery now and then, an adversary reveals their trump card when they\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nbecome desperate for access to a victim’s infrastructure. This occurred\n\nin October 2014 when the Chinese adversary tracked by CrowdStrike as\n\nHURRICANE PANDA deployed a tool called Win64.exe on a compromised\n\nsystem that was used to invoke other programs with elevated privileges.\n\nAnalysis of the Win64.exe binary revealed that it exploits a previously\n\nunknown vulnerability to elevate its privileges to those of the SYSTEM user\n\nand then create a new process with these access rights to run the command\n\nthat was passed as an argument. The file itself is only 55 kilobytes in size and\n\ncontains just a few functions.\n\nFirst, the exploit gained kernel execution by corrupting memory in the\n\nWindows window manager and used this increased level of authority to\n\noverwrite an access token in the EPROCESS structure of the user-mode\n\nprocess with that of the SYSTEM process. From this elevation, any command\n\npassed to the executable was executed with elevated privileges. The\n\nvulnerability was present in both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures of Windows\n\nfrom Windows XP to Windows 7.\n\nThe code to perform these steps is extremely well written and fully reliable.\n\nThe adversary has gone through considerable effort to minimize the\n\nchance of its discovery. The exploit tool was only deployed when absolutely\n\nnecessary during the intrusion operations, and it was deleted immediately\n\nafter use.\n\nA build timestamp of the Win64.exe binary of 3 May 2014 suggests that\n\nthe vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild for at least five months\n\nprior to discovery. What is more, after being able to characterize the\n\nexploit, earlier versions were found that indicate constant development of\n\nprivilege-escalation tools. In fact, some tools were found with exploits for\n\nsimilar vulnerabilities that have been addressed by Microsoft in patches\n\nreleased earlier in 2014. These tools share an overall structure with the\n\nnew one, indicating that the same code was used to weaponize privilege\nescalation exploits for different security bugs. These observations suggest\n\nthat HURRICANE PANDA maintains an arsenal of exploits for unpatched\n\nprivilege-escalation vulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nThis case underlines the necessity of tight endpoint monitoring in order to\n\ndetect adversary behavior like this. Within days of discovering the use of\n\nthe exploit, CrowdStrike reported the vulnerability and a proof of concept to\n\nMicrosoft, which subsequently released security bulletin MS14-058, as well as\n\npatches for all affected platforms.\n\n###### CVE-2014-1761 - Microsoft Word  Remote Code Execution\n\nIn 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence spent a significant amount of time\n\ninvestigating operations that leveraged the new Microsoft Word exploit,\n\nCVE-2014-1761. The exploit for this vulnerability was a bit complex, but if\n\nsuccessful it allowed for remote code execution. Cybercrime adversaries\n\nwere the first to use the exploit in the wild; however, its use soon proliferated\n\nto Russia- and China-based targeted intrusion adversaries.\n\nThe proliferation of an exploit such as CVE-2014-1761 across several\n\nadversaries is not unprecedented, but it does illustrate the possible ways\n\nin which actors are connected. In this instance, cybercrime actors were the\n\nfirst observed using the exploit in the wild. Several weeks later targeted\n\nintrusion adversaries began leveraging it in their operations. The most likely\n\nexplanation for this is that targeted intrusion adversaries were able\n\nto rediscover and develop the exploit code once a vendor advisory\n\nwas released.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nThis seems to be the most likely because Microsoft released its initial\n\nadvisory on the exploit in late March, and targeted activity began in early\n\nApril. However, another possible proliferation pathway for the exploit is a\n\ndirect pass from a cybercrime actor to a targeted intrusion actor. It is also\n\npossible that individuals involved in cybercrime operations are also carrying\n\nout targeted intrusion operations and were able to use the exploit for\n\nboth purposes.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence also discovered a simple builder program,\n\nwhich allowed malicious actors to automatically build CVE-2014-1761\n\nexploit documents.\n\nThis allows for a decoy document and malicious executable to be combined\n\nwith a malicious CVE-2014-1761 document. The Chinese characters show that\n\nit was meant for use by Chinese adversaries, and could explain how it\n\nso easily proliferated among China-based adversaries.\n\nPITTY PANDA is one actor who actively developed the capability to use this\n\nexploit. This actor is interesting in that they exhibit a remarkably disparate\n\nlevel of sophistication. On the one hand, the actor has proven to be one\n\nof the early groups that are able to successfully weaponize documents\n\nwith an exploit for CVE-2014-1761, showing a notable level of competence\n\nin this specific matter. On the other hand, this adversary exhibits lack of\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nconsistence or expertise in certain other areas. For example, the re-use of C2\n\ndomains ending in .tw certainly sticks out in target environments unrelated\n\nto Taiwan. This was observed in attacks against western aerospace and\n\ndefense companies during 2014.\n\nRecent CrowdStrike analysis on PITTY PANDA has revealed that this actor\n\nhas been operating for a longer time frame than previously assumed.\n\nThe activity likely goes back as far as June 2005, resulting in a total\n\noperational window of more than nine years. PITTY PANDA has used at least\n\nthree different RAT families, some of which have undergone continuous\n\ndevelopment.\n\nPITTY PANDA has recently shifted their target profile toward the aerospace\n\nand defense sectors, introducing a new aspect this actor’s operations.\n\nThe overall goal of much of PITTY PANDA’s past activity appeared to be\n\nintelligence-gathering operations of a political nature, but more recent\n\noperation point more toward the theft of intellectual property. The\n\ndevelopment and adaptation of client-side exploits such as CVE-2014-1761\n\nmay indicate that this actor is seeking to further expand operations by\n\ninvesting in technical capabilities to pursue harder targets than they have\n\npreviously attacked.\n\n###### Event-Driven Operations Malaysia Airlines Incidents\n\nMalaysia Airlines suffered two catastrophic incidents in 2014. In March, one of\n\nits flights (MH370) from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing mysteriously disappeared\n\nless than an hour after takeoff. In July, another of its flights (MH17) from\n\nAmsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down while flying over a conflict zone\n\nin Ukraine. These events received large amounts of attention in the press,\n\nand the controversy and mystery surrounding them made the incidents ideal\n\nfor targeted intrusion adversaries to use in their operations.\n\nOperations leveraging the MH370 incident in spear phish email began within\n\ndays of the accident. The TEMPER PANDA adversary was particularly prolific\n\nin its use of MH370-related emails to deliver malicious documents that\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\ndropped malware connecting to a known TEMPER PANDA C2 address, www.\n\nverizon.proxydns.com. Activity from the LOTUS PANDA adversary and an\n\nactor using Naikon malware was also observed.\n\nAdditionally, CrowdStrike identified an incident carried out by an adversary\n\nbelieved to have a nexus to Pakistan. This attack used a malicious zip archive\n\ncontaining a file named Malaysia Airline MH370 hijacked by Pakistan.scr. It\n\ndelivered malware more commonly known as BitterBug, which used a C2 at\n\nIP address 199.91.173.45.\n\nOperations related to the MH17 crash appeared to be more limited, but also\n\nbegan within days of the incident. A number of incidents from China-based\n\nadversaries were observed like the one identified on 22 July 2014 leveraging\n\na decoy document concerning the black boxes on MH17 and NetTraveler\n\nmalware connecting to a C2 at www.gobackto.net. The Russia-based\n\nadversary known to CrowdStrike as FANCY BEAR also piggybacked on the\n\nMH17 disaster, targeting victims with the Sofacy malware dropped alongside\n\na document concerning the cessation of hostilities around the crash site.\n\n###### Conflict in Ukraine\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has been the motivation for a significant amount of\n\ntargeted intrusion operations and other malicious cyber activity. The conflict\n\nwas leveraged to conduct operations targeting entities in Ukraine, Russia,\n\nand other countries with interests in the region.\n\nChina-based adversaries were active in targeting around this conflict. A\n\nsignificant amount of the activity from Chinese actors was related to the\n\nMH17 disaster discussed above. While other malicious operations related to\n\nthese events targeted Ukrainian entities, most of the activity from China\nbased actors appeared to be targeted at Russian organizations. Numerous\n\nincidents were identified leveraging Russian-language lures with content\n\nconcerning security in Ukraine, such as the one below that was observed in\n\nan incident from September using PlugX malware calling to chromeupdate.\n\nauthorizeddns.org and googlesupport.proxydns.com.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### t w o t h o u s a n d f o u r t e e n\n CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n## Notable Activity\n\nOne of the primary reasons for this increase in Russian targeting by China\nbased adversaries is likely that ties between China and Russia have recently\n\nbeen growing stronger. In May 2014, the two countries agreed on a $400\n\nbillion deal for Russia to supply natural gas to China. Additionally, they\n\nreached agreements over the construction of a bridge between the countries\n\nand the use of a port in eastern Russia; they also revealed a plan to set up\n\nGPS ground stations in each other’s country. This interaction between the\n\ntwo countries increasingly makes Russia a target of interest for Chinese\n\ntargeted intrusion operations.\n\nIn addition to the China-based activity, CrowdStrike Intelligence also\n\nidentified an interesting set of targeted activity apparently focused on\n\ntargets within Russia. The actor responsible employs a rather complex piece\n\nof malware that uses polymorphic DLLs and filenames customized on a\n\nper-deployment basis. The malware was dropped alongside a wide variety\n\nof malicious documents containing exploit code for either CVE-2012-0158\n\nor CVE-2014-1761. Related decoy documents were both Russian and English\n\nlanguage and contained content pertaining to Russia such as the Ukrainian\n\nconflict, an advertisement for the sale of a car from the German embassy\n\nin Moscow, and an invitation to a Russian university conference on space\n\ntechnology. The actor abuses legitimate cloud infrastructure for its C2.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\n###### High Volume of Southeast Asia Targeting\n\nGovernments in Southeast Asia and organizations doing business in the\n\nregion have been popular targets for China-based targeted intrusion\n\noperations for years. China is generally interested in Southeast Asia because\n\nof its proximity and its desire to monitor activity in the region in order\n\nto retain a strategic advantage. However, during 2014, China was more\n\nspecifically motivated to carry out targeted intrusion operations in the\n\nregion by tensions between it and other Southeast Asian nations, primarily\n\nVietnam and the Philippines, due to disputes over territorial rights in the\n\nSouth China Sea.\n\nThe South China Sea has long been a source of tension between China and\n\nother Southeast Asian nations. The United Nations (UN) attempted to ease\n\nthese tensions in its 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea, which granted\n\ncountries in the region rights to marine and energy resources within a certain\n\nrange of their coast. This was meant to give all countries in the region some\n\nclaim to vital trade routes and to the vast energy resources believed to exist\n\nthere. China disputes the UN-granted rights and stakes a historical claim to\n\nalmost the entire South China Sea.\n\nTensions really boiled over in May 2014 when a Chinese state-owned\n\nenergy company placed an oil rig, HD-981, in Vietnamese territorial\n\nwaters. The rig was deployed close to the Paracel Islands, which are\n\nclaimed by both China and Vietnam. The presence of the rig precipitated\n\ncontinuous clashes between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels, violent\n\nprotests of Chinese businesses in Vietnam, and elevated tensions\n\nbetween China and other nations in the region such as the Philippines.\n\nIt was during this time in May 2014 when China-based targeted intrusion\n\nactivity against entities in Southeast Asia increased significantly.\n\nThe uptick was likely due to Chinese interest in monitoring reaction\n\nof government and other organizations in the region. Numerous\n\nadversaries (primarily GOBLIN PANDA, VIXEN PANDA, LOTUS PANDA,\n\nPREDATOR PANDA, and PIRATE PANDA) and numerous malware variants\n\n(PlugX, Poison Ivy, Mirage, Enfal, and Naikon) were observed being used in\n\nthese operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### t w o t h o u s a n d f o u r t e e n\n CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n###### Observed targeting by country\n - may 2014\n\n Observed targeting by country\n - june 2014\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence observed that GOBLIN PANDA and VIXEN PANDA\n\nwere the adversaries most actively targeting Southeast Asia. GOBLIN\n\nPANDA activity was heavily weighted towards Vietnamese targets. This\n\nadversary used multiple malware variants during this period, but over time\n\nswitched over almost entirely to PlugX malware.\n\nBased on the decoy documents used in the incidents, it appears that\n\nVietnamese government organizations were a primary target (although\n\nprivate sector targeting of foreign companies was observed as well), as the\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\ndecoys were often Vietnamese government documents. The screenshot\n\nbelow is an example of one of these decoys, with this one related to\n\nVietnam’s Fisheries Protection Department. A reference to the HD-981 oil\n\nrig can be seen in the first sentence. The C2 domain for the malware used in\n\nconjunction with this document was dns.dubkill.com.\n\nIn the regional targeting surrounding these events, VIXEN PANDA activity\n\nwas observed focusing mostly on the Philippines, particularly in the area of\n\ndefense. Pictured below is a decoy document from an incident identified in\n\nApril. The only content is a header marked “Secret” with the letterhead for\n\nthe Philippines Naval Operation Center. The malware used in this incident was\n\nMirage, installed using DLL side-loading, which takes advantage of the search\n\norder the operating system goes through to load DLLs. This particular sample\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n11 http://blog.crowdstrike.com/\ndeep-thought-chinese-targeting-national-security-think-tanks/\n\n\nused NVIDIA-related files often seen with PlugX to side-load the Mirage\n\npayload. The C2 for the malware in this incident was todaynews.dns-dns.com.\n\nThe Southeast Asia activity declined dramatically at the end of August,\n\nwhich coincided with the time that China removed HD-981 from Vietnamese\n\nwaters. A slight spike occurred in October when PIRATE PANDA and VIXEN\n\nPANDA stepped up targeting of Vietnam and the Philippines again, possibly\n\ndue to arms acquisitions by Vietnam meant to bolster its maritime security\n\ncapabilities. Since that time, sporadic activity with a Southeast Asia focus\n\nwas observed, but nothing at a sustained level like that which was observed\n\nfrom May to October.\n\nIt is highly likely that tensions will increase again as the disputes over\n\nterritory and resources in the South China Sea remain unresolved.\n\n###### DEEP PANDA Think Tank Targeting\n\nIn July 2014, CrowdStrike publicly reported on malicious\n\nactivity linked to the DEEP PANDA adversary at two U.S.\nbased think tanks.[11] This activity followed typical DEEP\n\nPANDA Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) with\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n\nwhat, at the time, was a novel technique utilizing PowerShell to download\n\nMadHatter malware on victim machines. Although the TTPs were typical,\n\nthe specific targeting at each institution provided insight into how these\n\nadversaries may be tasked in their operations.\n\nAnalysis of each incident revealed that, up until mid-June 2014, the\n\nadversary was focused on experts on Asian and Chinese policy at each\n\naffected institution. This targeting is consistent with the objectives likely\n\nimposed on Chinese intelligence collection during this time in support of\n\nglobal intelligence collection surrounding the ongoing HD-981 incident.\n\nDuring mid-June, DEEP PANDA clearly and immediately shifted focus from\n\nAsia-related issues to Middle East-related issues. This shift coincided with a\n\nsignificant uptick in attacks from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS),\n\nparticularly an attack on the Baiji oil refinery in Iraq.\n\nAt one institution, the actor focused on a target with expertise in China’s\n\nnatural resource consumption and energy sourcing requirements. Additional\n\ntargets at this institution included an executive assistant and network\n\nengineers and administrators. The targeting of an executive assistant would\n\nlikely provide access to information on high-level strategy and operational\n\ninformation, and targeting of network administrators would provide\n\ninformation useful in lateral movement and establishing persistence.\n\nAt the second institution, targeted individuals had extensive careers in the\n\nU.S. government and intelligence community, had written on U.S. Middle East\n\npolicy, and had given congressional testimony on ISIS issues. The targets\n\nin this instance could provide information on potential U.S. strategy and\n\npossibly even communications between the institution and U.S.\n\ngovernment entities.\n\nThe rapid pivot between individuals at these institutions focused on Asia\n\nissues to individuals focused on Middle East issues shows how quickly these\n\nadversaries are able to react to new tasking. The targeting in these cases\n\nappear to be in line with interests of government organizations who would\n\ndesire information on strategic options that the U.S. might be considering\n\nwith respect to ISIS. Information from these kinds of institutions would also\n\nbe useful to companies doing business in the Middle East.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### t w o t h o u s a n d f o u r t e e n\n CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n## Notable Activity\n\n###### World Cup\n\nThe biggest event of the year in terms of media coverage and sheer global\n\nattention was the FIFA World Cup played in Brazil between 12 June and 13\n\nJuly. Events of this scale usually attract malicious actors who leverage them\n\nfor purposes of deceiving targets into credentials theft, compromise of\n\nnetworks for espionage, and other objectives.\n\nCrowdStrike covered the run-up to the World Cup with reporting that\n\noutlined potential threats to the event. Chief among these was that of\n\nhacktivists attacking or defacing websites related to the Cup. Designated\n\nadversary GHOST JACKAL was detected partaking in said actions prior to\n\nthe beginning of the tournament, which also saw large-scale street protests\n\nagainst the government.\n\nLater, during the Cup, CrowdStrike’s warning came to fruition when the\n\nwebsites for the Cup itself and for Brazil’s Federal Police were both taken\n\n\n12 Hackers Take Down World\nCup Site in Brazil, 20 June\n2014, http://bits.blogs.nytimes.\ncom/2014/06/20/hackers-takedown-world-cup-site-in-brazil/\n\n\ndown.[12] Additionally, CrowdStrike observed some limited World Cup-related\n\ntargeted intrusion activity from China-based actors LOTUS PANDA and\n\nVIXEN PANDA, but the level of activity from such actors was not as high\n\nas anticipated.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Know the Adversary\n\n###### Know your adversary to better protect your network.\n Detect, deter, and defend against today’s most sophisticated attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Know the Adversary\n\n\n###### Effect of Public Reporting on Adversary Activity\n\n In the 2013 Global Threat Report, CrowdStrike\n\n discussed a Russian adversary designated\n\n ENERGETIC BEAR. Beginning in July 2014, several\n\n security vendors disclosed additional information\n\n on this actor.\n\nThis adversary has previously demonstrated more than a basic\n\nawareness of operational security (OPSEC). Unsurprisingly,\n\nENERGETIC BEAR quickly abandoned their compromised website\n\nC2 infrastructure they had acquired for these operations. Although\n\ninfected machines would continue to beacon to the C2 servers, no\n\nfurther tasking would be provided.\n\nSince the public disclosures, no new builds of the malware used\n\nby ENERGETIC BEAR – primarily the Havex and SYSMain RATs –\n\nhave been observed. This toolset has seen several evolutionary\n\ndevelopments over a period spanning at least five years, and its\n\nloss is likely to cause the adversary to enter a retooling phase. The\n\nunderlying intelligence requirements driving their operations are\n\nunlikely to change, however, and it is likely that ENERGETIC BEAR\n\nwill re-emerge with a new toolset in the future.\n\nIn June 2014, CrowdStrike published[13] public reporting detailing the\n\nattribution of an adversary designated as PUTTER PANDA to the\n\n12th Bureau of the 3rd General Staff Department of the People’s\n\nLiberation Army, also known as Unit 61486. This attribution was\n\nfacilitated by one of the PUTTER PANDA operators providing\n\npictures of the unit’s operational base on social media, using\n\naccounts that could be associated with C2 domains – a serious\n\nOPSEC mistake. After the publication of CrowdStrike’s report, the\n\nsocial media account containing photos of the unit’s base was\n\ndeleted, and PUTTER PANDA appears to have stopped using the\n\n\n13 http://resources.crowdstrike.com/putterpanda/ tools previously identified by CrowdStrike.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Know the Adversary\n\n\nAnother significant public disclosure of an adversary group was the\n\npublication of a report on Unit 61398 (a.k.a. COMMENT PANDA) in\n\nFebruary 2013. While this group also initially “went dark” following\n\nthe report’s public release, there have been indications that this\n\nactor was in operation again by October 2013.\n\nThe disclosure of information regarding ongoing operations has\n\nbeen hotly contested in the information security community. Many\n\nattribute such disclosures to marketing or other self-promoting\n\nbehavior. While the motivations surrounding public disclosures are\n\ncertainly open to discussion, these observations indicate that public\n\ndisclosures to date have had a significant impact on advanced\n\nadversary operations.\n\nIt is becoming apparent that the priorities levied by organizations\n\nsponsoring cyber espionage are unaffected by such disclosures.\n\nIt is highly likely that groups who have been publicly reported on\n\nwill return to the same activities with new toolsets, if they have not\n\nalready. CrowdStrike’s approach to public disclosure balances the\n\nbenefits of disrupting operations with the risk of losing visibility into\n\nadversary actions by driving a change in TTPs.\n\nThis balance is accomplished by looking at the existing publicly\n\navailable reporting, and what the likely reaction by the adversary\n\nis. This is then reviewed in terms of Intelligence Gain/Loss (IGL);\n\namong other things, this includes the potential intelligence value of\n\na disclosure, what are potential impacts to visibility of the adversary,\n\nand how does this impact the ability to protect customers? Forcing\n\nthe adversary to retool means the cost of doing business has gone\n\nup; they must invest in new tools, infrastructure, and potentially\n\ntraining, which may have consequences for how brazen the\n\nadversary will be in the future.\n\n###### HURRICANE PANDA\n\nHURRICANE PANDA is an advanced China-based adversary actively\n\ntargeting Internet services, engineering, and aerospace companies.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Know the Adversary\n\n14 http://blog.crowdstrike.com/\nfrench-connection-french-aerospacefocused-cve-2014-0322-attack-sharessimilarities-2012/\n15 http://blog.crowdstrike.com/crowdstrike-discovers-use-64-bit-zero-dayprivilege-escalation-exploit-cve-20144113-hurricane-panda/\n\n\nSince February 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed\n\nHURRICANE PANDA leverage at least two zero-day exploits, a\n\nunique DNS resolution technique, and tools traditionally used by\n\nChinese actors. Once inside a victim’s network, this adversary\n\nseeks to gain legitimate credentials to move laterally and establish\n\nRDP sessions to achieve their objectives. Based on their technical\n\ncapabilities, HURRICANE PANDA is currently one of the most\n\nadvanced Chinese actors tracked by CrowdStrike.\n\n**Zero-days, Exploits, and Web Vulnerabilities**\n\nAs stated above, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed HURRICANE\n\nPANDA leveraging two zero-day exploits, indicating that this\n\nadversary has above-average capability or access to exploit\n\ndevelopers. First, in February 2014 this actor was observed using\n\nSWC tactics to gain initial footholds into victim networks via CVE\n2014-0322. Successful exploitation during this campaign led victims\n\nto install the Sakula malware. Much of the targeting in this campaign\n\nappeared to be against the French aerospace sector.[14]\n\nIn October 2014, HURRICANE PANDA used CVE-2014-4113 to\n\nescalate privileges on already-compromised 64-bit Windows\n\nmachines.[15] Their exploitation of this vulnerability marked the first\n\ntime it was observed in the wild.\n\nIn addition to zero-day exploits, HURRICANE PANDA has also used\n\nthree other privilege-escalation exploits and another remote code\n\nexecution exploit.\n\nFinally, in another case, HURRICANE PANDA gained initial access\n\nto a victim via a SQL injection vulnerability. They then used the\n\nvulnerability to upload a simple Chopper webshell script to gain\n\nadditional access, move laterally to the corporate network, and\n\ninstall additional RATs.\n\n###### The RAT Pack\n\nHURRICANE PANDA makes use of several Remote Access Tools\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Know the Adversary\n\n\n(RATs). Over the course of the year, CrowdStrike Intelligence\n\nobserved this adversary employing Sakula, Gh0st RAT, PlugX, and\n\nHiKit. While Gh0st RAT has been widely available for many years,\n\nthe other RATs have exclusively been tied to China-based actors.\n\nThis actor also made extensive use of Chopper webshell; this\n\nprovides the equivalent functionality of a RAT for adversary control\n\nof webservers. Chopper can exist in a rather simple form:\n\n###### <?php eval($_POST[“chopper”]); ?>\n\nwhere “chopper” is an attacker-selected password of sorts. This\n\nsimple one-line script gives an attacker access to a webserver from\n\nwhich they can deploy privilege-escalation tools, move laterally,\n\nor deploy more complex scripts to interact with databases on the\n\nwebserver.\n\nWhile PlugX usage has increased significantly over the past year\n\namong China-based actors, HURRICANE PANDA’s usage of the\n\ntool was notable for two reasons. First, when configuring PlugX,\n\nthe attacker is given the option of using up to four DNS servers\n\nof their choosing. Knowing this, HURRICANE PANDA discovered\n\na unique service offered by California-based Internet service\n\nprovider Hurricane Electric. By abusing Hurricane Electric’s free\n\nDNS service, the actors were able to resolve popular domains like\n\nwww.pinterest.com, adobe.com, and github.com. Using legitimate\n\ndomains presumably would fool incident responders into believing\n\nthe communications were benign.\n\nHURRICANE PANDA leveraged PlugX’s custom DNS feature to use\n\nthe free DNS hosting services provided by Hurricane Electric to\n\nresolve these domains to PlugX C2 nodes instead of their legitimate\n\nIP addresses. Hurricane Electric quickly took action to prevent the\n\nabuse that allowed DNS resolution for legitimate domains.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### t w o t h o u s a n d f o u r t e e n\n CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n### Know the Adversary\n\n###### Screenshot\n of PlugX\n User Interface\n\nThe other unique C2 resolution method employed by HURRICANE\n\nPANDA was the use of Google Code as a host for an encoded string\n\ncontaining the real PlugX C2 node as shown below.\n\n###### Google Projects Used by HURRICANE\n PANDA to Serve Encoded C2 Servers\n\nDespite this method of C2 server distribution being available in\n\nPlugX since at least 2012, its usage is not common. In this case, the\n\nPlugX malware will request one of the Google Code projects, search\n\nthe page for a string delimited with “DZKS” and “DZJS”, and decode\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Know the Adversary\n\n16 http://blog.crowdstrike.com/adversary-tricks-crowdstrike-treats/\n\n\nthe string. The decoded string contains the protocol over which\n\nto communicate, as well as the IP address and port pair. When the\n\nabove strings are decoded, the following IP addresses are used as\n\nPlugX C2 servers:\n\n**•** **223.29.248.9**\n\n**•** **202.181.133.237**\n\n**•** **61.78.34.179**\n\n**•** **203.135.134.243**\n\n**Post-Exploitation and Exfiltration**\n\nAfter HURRICANE PANDA has established a foothold on a victim’s\n\nnetwork, they then seek legitimate credentials via tools such\n\nas Windows Credential Viewer, Windows Credential Editor, or\n\nMimikatz. Once credentials have been obtained, the actor tends to\n\nuse these for access to the network instead of interacting with their\n\nRAT, thus reducing their footprint and allowing them to appear as\n\nlegitimate VPN users.\n\nIf credentials cannot be obtained, HURRICANE PANDA will often\n\nrely on RDP. First, they will replace the sticky keys file (using the\n\nsethc.exe hack[16]) with a copy of their preferred Chinese version of\n\ncmd.exe on the victim machine. Then they will access the victim\n\ncomputer over RDP, and, when presented with a login screen, IT\n\nwill invoke the sticky keys mechanism and be presented with an\n\nadministrative command shell. Furthermore, PlugX contains a\n\nreverse-RDP tunneling capability that HURRICANE PANDA has\n\nemployed.\n\nExfiltration by HURRICANE PANDA follows a simple pattern often\n\nperformed by China-based adversaries. First, files of interest are\n\ncompressed and password protected using RAR. Next, they stage\n\nthe files at a convenient location. Finally, they exfiltrate the files\n\nfrom the network via FTP.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n### Know the Adversary\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Know the Adversary\n\n\nIn addition to targeting of individuals within targeted organizations,\n\nphishing messages from this adversary were observed being sent\n\nto mailing lists for specialized topics such as high-performance\n\ncomputing, weather metadata software, and pre-medical programs\n\nat educational institutions.\n\nAn observed phishing message is show below:\n\nVictims in these campaigns were infected with the implant known\n\nby the anti-virus name Pirpi, which has been seen in use since 2009.\n\nPirpi provides the adversary with a traditional set of RAT features\n\nthat allow the adversary to exfiltrate and deploy files, along with\n\nremote shell access to a compromised system.\n\nGOTHIC PANDA is considered by CrowdStrike Intelligence to be\n\none of the more advanced adversaries tracked. Over time, the Pirpi\n\nimplant has improved to feature more aggressive anti-analysis\n\ntechniques, and the network communication with control servers\n\nhas improved to hinder network-based detection.\n\nWhile investigating GOTHIC PANDA, CrowdStrike Intelligence\n\nidentified a strong code overlap between the Pirpi implant and\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Know the Adversary\n\n\na defunct malware known by the anti-virus name Dreammon (or\n\nDreamClick). This malware possesses a feature set more in line\n\nwith adclicker malware rather than targeted activity. As adclicker\n\nmalware is more common with criminal adversaries, it has been\n\npostulated that if the same adversary behind Dreammon is\n\nbehind Pirpi, this adversary’s initial motives may have been\n\nfinancially driven.\n\n###### Overview of Russian Threat Actors\n\nAlthough the Chinese calendar predicted that 2014 would be the\n\nYear of the Horse, in many respects 2014 has been the Year of the\n\nBear in the cyber realm, with several high-profile Russia-based\n\nactors receiving public attention. The reported activity has included\n\nactors tracked by CrowdStrike as ENERGETIC BEAR, FANCY BEAR,\n\nand VENOMOUS BEAR, as well as other sets such as Sandworm,\n\nwhich uses the Black Energy toolset in targeted attacks, in contrast\n\nto its normal use as criminal malware. CrowdStrike also tracks\n\nother adversaries attributed to Russia under cryptonyms such\n\nas BERSERK BEAR, BOULDER BEAR, and the financial-crime\nmotivated actor MAGNETIC SPIDER.\n\nVENOMOUS BEAR, also known as Snake, Turla, and Oroborous, uses\n\na set of implants that culminates in a sophisticated Windows-based\n\nrootkit that can leverage an encrypted Virtual File System (VFS) as\n\na staging area for tools to deploy and data prepared for exfiltration.\n\nIt also includes implants for other platforms such as Linux that\n\ncan be used to operate command-and-control infrastructure.\n\nExternal reporting indicates a targeting bias toward entities in the\n\ngovernment sector, along with the use of zero-day exploits. These\n\nTTPs, along with the maturity of the attacker’s toolset, indicate that\n\nthis is a highly sophisticated adversary.\n\nFANCY BEAR is CrowdStrike’s name for an adversary also known\n\nas Sofacy. Although the tools used by this actor are not as complex\n\nas those employed by VENOMOUS BEAR, they share a common\n\ntargeting focus on government and military entities, with a particular\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Know the Adversary\n\n\nemphasis on Russia’s “near abroad” regions such as Eastern Europe.\n\nAs well as implants for Windows, Linux, and mobile operating\n\nsystems, FANCY BEAR employs credential phishing attacks,\n\nspoofing legitimate sites to harvest the details of users of interest.\n\nProactive analysis during 2014 revealed another Russian actor that\n\nhas not encountered public exposure, yet appears to have been\n\ntasked by Russian state interests. BERSERK BEAR has conducted\n\noperations from 2004 through to the present day, primarily aimed\n\nat collecting intelligence but has also provided capability in support\n\nof offensive operations in parallel to the Russia/Georgia conflict in\n\nAugust 2008.\n\nENERGETIC BEAR has been tracked by CrowdStrike since 2012. The\n\nadversary initially focused on targets in the energy sector, but more\n\nrecently had branched out to attempt to compromise financial,\n\nindustrial, and commercial organizations. This corresponded with\n\na shift from primarily using SWC attack vectors to targeted email\n\nattacks. Analysis of ENERGETIC BEAR’s post-exploitation activity\n\nrevealed the use of custom tools for credential harvesting, network\n\nenumeration, and interaction with industrial automation equipment.\n\n###### FANCY BEAR\n\nIn the second half of 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence analyzed the\n\ntargeted attack activity of a particularly interesting Russian actor\n\nnamed FANCY BEAR. The campaigns conducted by this actor\n\ntarget high-profile military and government entities in a variety\n\nof countries, most notably political institutions of former Soviet\n\nnations as well as Eastern European countries, NATO institutions,\n\nand organizations of western countries. Technical indicators, such\n\nas the resource locales and C2 domain registrant information,\n\nexhibit references to a Russian-speaking adversary. In addition,\n\nthe targeting is consistent with strategic interests of the Russian\n\nFederation.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Know the Adversary\n\n\nTargeting of high-profile entities requires mature and versatile\n\ntechnical means. FANCY BEAR exhibits a consistent level of\n\ntechnical sophistication with respect to its tools, and the actor is\n\ncharacterized by a thorough preparation of attacks and required\n\ninfrastructure. Their main implant, called X-Agent, is a sophisticated\n\nRAT that exhibits a modular architecture and a multi-year\n\ndevelopment history. As a consequence, the adversary can combine\n\nthe necessary implant functionality on a per-target basis, spanning\n\nmultiple operating systems and mobile platforms.\n\nA remarkable feature only seen with some of the well-engineered\n\nand mature targeted attack malware is the following: If required,\n\nthe implant can switch the carrier protocol for its command-and\ncontrol channel ranging from HTTP over email to removable media.\n\nThe latter is specifically suited for target environments that do not\n\nhave direct network connectivity to a C2 node and instead rely on\n\nperiodic use of USB removable media to bridge air gaps. In addition,\n\nrecent incidents involved heavily obfuscated malware including code\n\nflow obfuscation, likely another step taken in order to hinder analysis\n\nefforts. All of these underline a clear targeted attack mission.\n\n\n-----\n\n# 2015 Predictions\n\n###### Understand how the evolving capabilities of these advanced adversaries will affect  you in 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Looking Forward\n\n\n###### Predicting what will happen in 2015 is a challenge, as unforeseen events will inevitably occur and new TTPs from adversaries across the motivational spectrum will continue to shape the threat environment. Before exploring what may be coming in 2015, a brief look back at the predictions for 2014 is in order.\n\nLast year, CrowdStrike made a number of predictions about the\n\n2014 threat landscape, many of which came to fruition:\n\n- \u0007North Korean Activity – CrowdStrike Intelligence predicted that\n\nNorth Korea might use its cyber operations to project power\n\nduring 2014. This prediction came to fruition at the end of 2014\n\nwhen a North Korean adversary attacked Sony because of one of\n\nthe studio’s movies that North Korea perceived as an act of war.\n\n- \u0007Windows XP End of Life – Targeted attackers did use exploits\n\nsuch CVE-2014-1776 to target out-of-life Windows XP machines.\n\nThis continues to be a significant risk, as the existence of legacy\n\nWindows XP machines continues to expose an attack surface.\n\n**• \u0007Third-Party Targeting – 2013 saw actors targeting third-party**\n\nvendors offering DNS, social media, and content management\n\nservices in order to attack customers of those services. As one\n\nexample, CrowdStrike observed a number of attacks by the\n\nHURRICANE PANDA adversary against DNS and hosting providers\n\nin 2014; these attacks were highly likely used to ultimately target\n\nthose providers’ customers.\n\n**• \u0007Sandbox-Aware Malware – The use of sandbox-aware malware**\n\nwas not new to 2014, but adversaries did make significant use\n\nof malware variants capable of detecting if they were being\n\nrun in sandbox environments. These techniques ranged from\n\ndetection of sandboxes through system and network artifacts,\n\ndetection of user activity, and even prompting user interaction as\n\na countermeasure.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Looking Forward\n\n\n\n**• \u0007Use of High-Level Languages – The 2014 yearly report noted**\n\na downward trend in the use of low-level languages like C and\n\na growing trend in the use of high-level languages like C# and\n\nPython. During 2014, CrowdStrike did observe several adversaries\n\nsuch as VICEROY TIGER making heavy use of a malware variant\n\nthat primarily leveraged Python script.\n\n**• \u0007Activity in the Physical World – Physical world conflict often leads**\n\nto related cyber operations, and 2014 was no different. A number\n\nof conflicts in the physical space such as those in the South China\n\nSea, Ukraine, and the Middle East all resulted in related cyber\n\noperations by targeted intrusion adversaries in China, Russia, and\n\nIran, as well as nationalist and hacktivist actors.\n\n2015 will undoubtedly hold many surprises and new developments\n\nin the realm of computer security. The following section contains\n\nestimative judgments about what may be likely trends or\n\noccurrences in the next year.\n\n###### Research and Development\n\nResearch and development during one year can often set the\n\nexpectations and direction of the next. With this in mind, the\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence team carefully observed patterns and\n\ntrends in the security research community. Based on the trends of\n\n2014, the following estimates were developed:\n\n- \u0007It is expected that Let’s Encrypt, the first free certificate authority\n\nwith a pre-installed root certificate in major browsers, will launch in\n\n2015. This service will offer very simple command line provisioning\n\nof certificates for use in HTTPS. As a result of the ease of use and\n\navailability, it is likely that an increasing amount of Internet traffic\n\nwill be encrypted. As HTTP traffic becomes less common, it is\n\nmore likely to be suspect and subject to closer inspection. This\n\nopens the possibility that more adversaries may look to leverage\n\nSSL certificates for command and control. Additionally, Content\n\nSecurity Policy (CSP) for webpages means that XSS-attacks will\n\nbecome more complicated to mount. In 2015, it is expected that\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Looking Forward\n\n\ntwo-factor authentication will be more widely deployed across\n\nenterprise and cloud services, which will hopefully hamper the\n\neffectiveness of credential and banking phishing operations.\n\n- \u0007Adversaries are constantly advancing their capabilities; overseas,\n\ncryptography and its application has continued to dominate the\n\ntechnology news, beginning with revelations from the Snowden\n\nleaks. CrowdStrike assesses it is possible that adversaries will\n\ndeploy more sophisticated encryption and key agreement\n\nschemes to hamper interception by security professionals and\n\nintelligence services.\n\n- \u0007In 2015, a number of sandboxes using hypervisor introspection\n\nwill become available, both commercially and in open source.\n\nIntrospection allows a sandbox to instrument a virtual machine\n\nthrough the hypervisor; this provides additional stealth to the\n\nsandbox, allowing it to avoid detection. It remains to be seen\n\nwhether malware authors will completely cease their efforts to\n\ndetect traditional sandboxing solution and/or whether they will try\n\nto subvert introspection-based sandboxes. Given the difficulty in\n\ndetection, and the speed at which new technologies are adopted,\n\nit is likely that adversaries will continue to detect traditional\n\nsandboxes in 2015, with more advanced adversaries exploring\n\ntechniques to identify or evade introspection-based systems.\n\n- \u0007Embedded devices, regardless of whether they are home routers\n\nor industrial control systems, will be increasingly targeted. One\n\nof the primary factors impacting this belief is the increasing pace\n\nof vulnerability disclosures in the embedded space and in the\n\nunderlying software they leverage. The increasing prevalence and\n\npopularity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, discussed in more\n\ndetail below, is another factor in this likely targeting. This targeting\n\nwill likely occur across a variety of threat actors. In 2014, we saw\n\nthe compromise of home router technology used to build an\n\nembedded proxy layer used to mask the identity of the attacker.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Looking Forward\n\n\n\n- \u0007Internet of Things (IoT) devices are still in their infancy and the\n\nconcept of IoT has not yet become widely adopted or even\n\navailable to the average end user. There are, however, a large\n\nnumber of devices being sold already that would fit under the IoT\n\numbrella, even if they do not make use of the IoT communication\n\nstandards. While targeted attacks against IoT devices are unlikely\n\nat this time, the potential to abuse IoT devices for amplified DDOS\n\nas well as disrupting IoT networks through DOS’ing of central\n\ncontrol infrastructure might well be possible.\n\n###### Outlook for China-Based Adversaries\n\nChina is, by now, well known for conducting cyber espionage\n\ncampaigns focused on accessing intelligence about intellectual\n\nproperty, mergers and acquisitions, and technologies highlighted\n\nin its Five-Year plans. Targeting these technologies and strategic\n\nbusiness information allow its domestic companies to rapidly make\n\n“leap frog” developments, and to benefit from favorable bargaining\n\npositions, thus elevating them to become global leaders. This\n\nbehavior is expected to continue in 2015, as will continued targeting\n\nof foreign government entities in an attempt to access information\n\nrelated to the global strategy and plans of these countries.\n\nChina is expected to continue to leverage this espionage as a means\n\nto conduct intelligence collection to support its aspirations to\n\nfurther push the envelope on its territorial claims. This is particularly\n\ntrue in the South China Sea (SCS) conflicts with Vietnam and the\n\nPhilippines, and the Senkaku/Diaoyu island dispute with Japan.\n\nChina has already undertaken substantial construction of manmade\n\nislands in the SCS to begin projecting its power, and as its Navy\n\ncontinues to grow, it will only seek to push further beyond its\n\ncurrent boundaries. China is aggressively moving forward with the\n\ndesign and implementation of its own aircraft carriers, which will\n\nno doubt have an impact in this regional issue, allowing the PRC to\n\nproject force and intimidate its neighbors.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Looking Forward\n\n\nTaiwan will continue to play a very important role in the potential\n\nconflicts to come, not only as a testing ground for malware, but as\n\nthe main focus for expanding Chinese territorial claims. The PRC\n\nviews Taiwan as an inalienable part of China that will eventually\n\nbe reunited for the greater good of both peoples and therefore\n\nplaces it above other territorial conflicts. Taiwan’s recent shift\n\ntowards a decidedly less-Beijing-friendly, DPP-led government is\n\nof great concern to China and will be a major factor in how China\n\nuses technology to facilitate its political maneuverings. Taiwan has\n\nhistorically been penetrated by PRC intelligence services at all\n\nlevels, which makes cyber one of the first visible indicators of PRC\n\nintentions regarding Taiwan.\n\nChina has also made significant headway on projecting its “soft\n\npower” abroad via multiple billion-dollar investments, particularly\n\nin the sectors of communications and transportation infrastructure.\n\nFor years, China has been making inroads in Africa to provide\n\nthe vast majority of the continent’s telecommunication systems,\n\nbut only recently have some of the more sinister intentions been\n\nbrought to light.\n\nIn December 2014, approximately\n\n77 Chinese nationals were found\n\nto be running a sophisticated\n\ncommand center out of a house in\n\nNairobi, Kenya, which appeared to\n\nbe capable of targeting the main\n\ncommunication systems in the\n\ncapital. A building with multiple\n\nlarge satellites that appears to be\n\nannexed to the Chinese embassy in\n\nParis was also recently reported on\n\nand believed to be connected to\n\nthe 3PLA’s 8th Bureau, Unit 61046,\n\nwhich is responsible for SIGINT\n\ncollection on western Europe.\n\n\n###### Image of Alleged\n\n Embassy Annex\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Looking Forward\n\n\nThere has also been a significant amount of investment poured\n\ninto transportation projects, particularly high-speed rail (HSR)\n\nlines, in multiple countries. China has already planned to merge its\n\ntwo top train makers into a HSR juggernaut capable of building\n\nmassive rail lines around the world. To this end, China has submitted\n\nbids for massive rail projects in Nigeria, and nearly won (this was\n\nsubsequently canceled) another project in Mexico. China has\n\nalso suggested massive lines between Beijing and Moscow and\n\nconstructing a line between Delhi and Chennai in India. Beijing also\n\nremains interested in proposals for HSRs in Britain and California,\n\nand has already made headway on construction of a Hungary\nSerbian HSR that will connect Belgrade to Budapest.\n\nIn total, the projects proposed by China would give it control of\n\nmore than 40,000 km, giving it significant control over the world’s\n\ntransportation routes. It seems fairly likely that, given China’s\n\nprevious use of espionage against foreign companies (which it has\n\nused to gain advantages in competitive bidding and mergers &\n\nacquisitions), there is a substantial motivation for China to follow\n\nsuit in the coming year as it looks to secure its position as the global\n\nleader in HSR construction.\n\n###### Joint Plan of Action Could Possibly Drive Iranian Cyber Attacks\n\nThe Iranian Joint Plan of Action (JPOA), its delay, and its ultimate\n\ndesired path by politicians to negotiate a Comprehensive Plan\n\nof Action (CPOA) are preeminent issues in the global press and\n\npolitical circles. The JPOA is a temporary agreement made between\n\nIran and an intergovernmental negotiating body consisting of China,\n\nFrance, the Russian Federation, the Unßited Kingdom, the United\n\nStates and Germany. The agreement was originally intended to be\n\na six-month period in which the Iranian government would reduce\n\nits stockpile of enriched uranium fuel and suspend specific aspects\n\nof its nuclear energy programs in exchange for the UN Security\n\nCouncil relaxing of specific sanctions previously imposed against\n\nIran. During this time of suspended nuclear research activities and\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Looking Forward\n\n\neased sanctions, negotiating parties would discuss the details of a\n\nmore permanent agreement, known as the Comprehensive Plan of\n\nAction (CPOA).\n\nThe JPOA could be a driver or tipping point for future cyber\n\nattacks by Iran against western targets. Iran has publicly noted\n\nthe understanding that negotiations can be influenced and has\n\ndemonstrated historically that it is willing (and has capabilities)\n\nto conduct cyber operations to influence negotiations if it sees fit\n\nto do so. It has been publicly speculated that Iran has conducted\n\nretaliatory attacks, notably the Shamoon incident in 2012.\n\nRecent open-source activities in the Iranian underground suggest\n\nIran may be attempting to structure or resource for possible future\n\ncyber operations. There have been visibility changes with regard\n\nto information surrounding Iranian hackers, as well as forums and\n\nwebsites. Popular forums for Iranian hackers ISCN and Shabgard\n\nhave been shut down and are no longer publicly accessible.\n\nDespite the shutdowns, there will likely be little change to the\n\ncommunication occurring between affiliated hackers in closed\n\ncommunications pathways. The closing of these forums could be in\n\nanticipation of future malicious activity and a desire to decrease the\n\npublic profile of individuals in the Iranian underground.\n\nThere are also clear links between the Iranian government hacking\n\ncontests intended to identify hackers with advanced skills and\n\nto learn advanced methods of network intrusion. For example,\n\nin November 2013, just before the JPOA agreement was signed,\n\nSharif University of Technology conducted a contest for “innovative\n\nmethods” of computer network intrusions and defense against\n\nsuch intrusions. Based on the contest announcements, Iranian\n\ngovernment cyber security authorities had access to the students’\n\nsubmissions in the contest, and those submissions were not\n\nreleased to the public but rather kept private to only those with\n\naccess to the contest submissions.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Looking Forward\n\n\nIranian adversaries such as ROCKET KITTEN, FLYING KITTEN,\n\nand CHARMING KITTEN were quite active during 2014 targeting\n\nwestern governments and companies. The motivation to attack\n\nsuch targets will only increase during 2015. However, should the\n\nprocess around the JPOA and CPOA take a turn that Iran perceives\n\nas disadvantageous, the motivation will likely greatly increase.\n\nRecent revelations indicate that ROCKET KITTEN may have, in fact,\n\ntargeted the JPOA negotiations using spear phishing that may have\n\ntargeted diplomats involved in the meetings.\n\n###### Cyber Spillover from Regional Conflicts\n\nLast year’s report included cyber spillover as something to look for\n\nin 2014, and it will be equally as important in 2015. Increasingly, real\nworld physical conflicts are carrying with them associated cyber\n\ncomponents. Sometimes the related cyber operations are carried\n\nout by entities directly engaged in the conflict, and other times\n\nentities not directly involved will engage in cyber operations in an\n\nattempt to support one side or the other. It is not possible to predict\n\nall possible conflicts in 2015, but there are three primary areas to\n\nkeep an eye on.\n\nThe conflict that may see the most significant uptick in associated\n\nactivity is the one centered around ISIS. The Syrian civil war saw\n\nquite a bit of associated cyber operations against western targets\n\nin 2013, many of which were attributed to the DEADEYE JACKAL\n\nadversary (Syrian Electronic Army). Since that time, the ISIS\n\nterrorist group has become a significant threat in the region and\n\nappears to be capable of bringing resources to bear to carry out\n\nmalicious cyber attacks.\n\nAlready, in early January 2015, a group calling itself CyberCaliphate\n\nand declaring support for ISIS hacked the social media presence of\n\nU.S. Central Command and used it to spread Islamist propaganda.\n\nIt is likely that this and other related groups supporting the Islamist\n\ncause will engage in operations that support ISIS objectives. Most\n\nof this activity is likely to be a nuisance, such as defacements and\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Looking Forward\n\n\nlow-level DDOS attacks, but it is possible that more advanced actors\n\ncould carry out targeted or even destructive attacks.\n\nThe South China Sea will be an area to continue to watch in 2015.\n\nAs discussed above, tensions in this area drove a great deal of\n\ntargeted intrusion activity from China-based adversaries in 2014.\n\nTensions subsided toward the end of 2014, but the region is rich in\n\nnatural resources and countries there, particularly China, are eager\n\nto lay claim to those resources. Because of this, there is a significant\n\npossibility that the conflict will flare up again in the coming year.\n\nOne thing that could temper the possibility for conflict is if oil\n\nprices remain low, making oil exploration in the area potentially less\n\nlucrative.\n\nUkraine is the third region to keep an eye on for possible cyber\n\nspillover in 2015. The physical conflict there already spilled over\n\ninto cyberspace, as was discussed above. So long as the Ukrainian\n\nconflict remains unresolved and foreign governments continue to\n\nexert pressure on Russia via economic sanctions, expect continued\n\nRussian targeting of governments, particularly those in Europe and\n\nthe U.S.\n\nAnother related contributing factor to Russian cyber operations is\n\nthe falling price of oil. Russia’s economy is deeply dependent on oil\n\nprices. The precipitous fall in the price of oil at the end of 2014 and\n\ngoing into 2015 has already caused a great deal of economic turmoil\n\nin Russia. An extended period of low oil prices could result in\n\nincreased malicious cyber activity from Russian adversaries against\n\nforeign governments and private sector organizations.\n\n###### The Future for PoS Attacks\n\nPoS malware experienced a great deal of success during 2014,\n\nhowever upcoming changes may force changes in payment\nprocessing systems in the U.S. For example, several major credit\n\ncard companies are expected to institute new policies in October\n\n2015 that will shift liability for fraudulent transactions to whomever\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Looking Forward\n\n\nis using the weakest payment-processing systems. The purpose\n\nof this is to drive retailers to adopt EMV (Europay, MasterCard,\n\nand Visa) standards, which entail chip and PIN cards that use a\n\ncombination of the traditional PIN number and an embedded\n\nmicrochip that encrypts vital information. This type of card offers a\n\nmore secure payment card solution for consumers.\n\nAdditionally, several alternative solutions, such as Apple Pay and\n\nGoogle Wallet, have started becoming adopted, allowing for\n\npayment via token systems. In theses systems, rather than a card\n\nnumber being transmitted, a one-time token is passed from a\n\nconsumer’s device to the retailer. The advantage to this system is\n\nthat in the event of the token being obtained by an unauthorized\n\nparty, it cannot be reused for later transactions.\n\nAdoption of these newer payment processes should provide\n\nconsumers with more secure payment methods and make it more\n\ndifficult for criminals seeking to make money off these systems.\n\nThere will be some lag time in 2015 as retailers and banks move to\n\nput these improvements in place, during which cybercriminals will\n\nstill be able to exploit the current, antiquated payment processing\n\nsystems in the U.S. However, the newer processes, once in place,\n\nshould lead to a decline in the type of PoS attacks seen over\n\nthe past year.\n\nDespite this decline, it is almost certain that the implementation\n\nof more secure methods will lead cybercriminals to develop\n\nmore sophisticated means by which to attack payment\nprocessing systems.\n\n###### Destructive and Disruptive Attacks\n\nDestructive attacks (such as those carried out by SILENT\n\nCHOLLIMA) and disruptive attacks (such as the DDOS activity\n\nagainst gaming platforms) garnered headlines at the end of 2014.\n\nThe high-profile nature of these attacks does not necessarily\n\nindicate that they will grow in popularity in 2015, however it is\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Looking Forward\n\n\npossible that the success of these attacks may encourage other\n\ngroups to engage in destructive or disruptive operations to\n\nadvance their interests.\n\nAs an example of this, a series of disruptive attacks in December\n\ntargeted online gaming platforms. These attacks manifested in the\n\nform of DDOS operations carried out by the LizardSquad group\n\nbriefly discussed above. The attacks came in two waves, the first of\n\nwhich was in early December when the Xbox Live and PlayStation\n\nnetworks were knocked offline for a short period of time. The\n\nsecond wave of attacks occurred on 25 December 2014 when the\n\nXbox and PlayStation online platforms suffered more outages that\n\nLizardSquad claimed responsibility for. CrowdStrike Intelligence\n\nis also aware of DDOS threats against other gaming platforms\n\nincluding Valve Software, which appeared to be targeted by a DNS\n\namplification DDOS attack that is similar to previous\n\nLizardSquad activity.\n\nMalicious actors have already engaged in disruptive campaigns in\n\nearly 2015. Following the January terrorist attacks in France, a group\n\nof Islamist hackers known as Fallaga conducted DDOS attacks\n\nagainst servers hosting websites for French foreign embassies. Soon\n\nafter, another Islamist group identifying with ISIS took control of\n\nthe Twitter and YouTube accounts for U.S. Central Command and\n\nposted a number of messages threatening U.S. troops and their\n\nfamilies.\n\nOrganizations in all sectors should be aware of, and prepared\n\nfor, destructive and disruptive attacks. These operations are\n\noften motivated by a specific grievance, but sometimes no clear\n\nmotivation can be established. Continuous monitoring for publicized\n\nthreats against an organization, or for potential areas of controversy\n\nthat could motivate malicious activity, is vital to detect and prepare\n\nfor these types of attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Conclusion\n\n###### The question now is: How do you incorporate intelligence into your daily defenses and prioritize resources based on risk to your business?\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\n###### In the course of reviewing 2014, there were so many\n\n interesting events, adversaries, and innovations that\n\n selecting examples for this report was an incredible\n\n challenge. The CrowdStrike Intelligence team spent\n\n much time narrowing the scope of topics covered\n\n herein. The adversaries in 2014 proved, if nothing else,\n\n to be dynamic, persistent, and innovative. Defenders\n\n must be inventive, diligent, and decisive in their efforts\n\n to defend the enterprise from these attackers.\n\n 2015 will be a continuation of the cat-and-mouse\n\n game that is played between the adversary and\n\n the defender. Adversaries across the motivational\n\n spectrum will continue to evolve their tactics in\n\n order to achieve their objectives. Although tactics\n\n may evolve, network defenders will be able to have\n\n success against the adversary so long as they are well\n\n prepared.\n\n Intelligence will provide the decisive advantage\n\n to both sides, and having a good defense will\n\n be predicated on having an informed, intelligent\n\n defensive team. The incorporation of intelligence into\n\n the daily defense of the enterprise will continue to\n\n be paramount and products, services, and solution\n\n providers will need to use this intelligence to stay\n\n ahead of the adversary.\n\n At CrowdStrike, intelligence powers everything we do,\n\n and as 2015 unfolds, organizations using intelligence\n\n will be better prepared to detect, deter, and defend\n\n against their adversaries.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike  Global Threat Intel Report\n\n Crowdstrike Falcon  Intelligence\n\n CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence portal\n\n provides enterprises with strategic,\n\n customized, and actionable intelligence.\n\n Falcon Intelligence enables organizations\n\n to prioritize resources by determining\n\n targeted versus commodity attacks,\n\n saving time and focusing resources on\n\n critical threats.
