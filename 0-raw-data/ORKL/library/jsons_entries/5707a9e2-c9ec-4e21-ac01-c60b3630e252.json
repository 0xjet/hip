CISA and FBI strongly urge\naffected MSPs and their customers to follow the guidance below.\n\nCISA and FBI recommend affected MSPs:\n\n[Download the Kaseya VSA Detection Tool. This tool analyzes a system (either VSA](https://kaseya.app.box.com/s/0ysvgss7w48nxh8k1xt7fqhbcjxhas40)\nserver or managed endpoint) and determines whether any indicators of compromise\n(IOCs) are present.\nEnable and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) on every single account that is\nunder the control of the organization, and—to the maximum extent possible—enable\nand enforce MFA for customer-facing services.\nImplement allowlisting to limit communication with remote monitoring and management\n(RMM) capabilities to known IP address pairs and/or\n\n\n-----\n\nPlace administrative interfaces of RMM behind a virtual private network (VPN) or a\nfirewall on a dedicated administrative network.\n\nCISA and FBI recommend MSP customers affected by this attack take immediate action to\nimplement the following cybersecurity best practices. Note: these actions are especially\nimportant for MSP customers who do not currently have their RMM service running due to\nthe Kaseya attack.\n\nCISA and FBI recommend affected MSP customers:\n\nEnsure backups are up to date and stored in an easily retrievable location that is airgapped from the organizational network;\nRevert to a manual patch management process that follows vendor remediation\nguidance, including the installation of new patches as soon as they become available;\nImplement:\n\nMulti-factor authentication; and\nPrinciple of least privilege on key network resources admin accounts.\n\n**Resources:**\n\nCISA and FBI provide these resources for the reader’s awareness. CISA and FBI do not\nendorse any non-governmental entities nor guarantee the accuracy of the linked resources.\n\n[For the latest guidance from Kaseya, see Kaseya's Important Notice July 3rd, 2021.](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4403440684689-Important-Notice-July-3rd-2021)\nFor indicators of compromise, see Peter Lowe's GitHub page REvil Kaseya CnC\nDomains.
