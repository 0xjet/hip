The\nhacker who goes by Mr. Smith posted five scripts for Game of Thrones and a month's worth\nof email from HBO Vice President for Film Programming Leslie Cohen along with some other\n[corporate information, according to the Associated Press.](https://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_HBO_HACK?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2017-08-07-20-02-47)\n\nThe general consensus among cybersecurity insiders is the hacker was able to procure this\ninformation through a series of small attacks conducted over an extended period of time tied\nto poor security practices by either by HBO or perhaps a third-party vendor. Mr. Smith\nseemed to confirm the timeline saying the $6 million ransom amount is tied to the length of\ntime his crew spent on the hack, about six months.\n\n\n-----\n\nThrough a persistent effort of phishing, malware attacks and plain old social engineering,\nthe attackers likely compromised many individual identities. Once these identities are\ncompromised, the attackers can inject malware onto systems that over time learn more\npasswords and allow them lateral access into other systems on the network,” Corey\nWilliams, Centrify's senior director of products and Marketing, told SC Media.\n\nAnother strong possibility is HBO is simply another victim of partnering with a third-party\nvendor that either made an error or did not have its cybersecurity ducks lined up in a row. If\nthis turns out to be true HBO will join a long list of companies, to include Verizon, Trump\nHotels, Hard Rock and Scottrade, which suffered a data breach due to one of these ancillary\ncompanies proving to be a weak link.\n\n“They have to treat intellectual property (IP) with the same level of protection that banks treat\nregulated customer information – that is it should be given the highest level of IT security\ncontrols and data privacy protection. Then in those instances where a studio has outsourced\nto a vendor (e.g. Larson Studios and the Netflix hack), they must insure that their vendors\nemploy equally strong security,” Brad Keller, director 3rd Party Strategy for Prevalent, said in\nan email interview with SC Media.\n\nHBO launched an investigation into the initial attack that took place on August 1 when its\nCEO and Chairman Richard Plepler confirmed the cable company had been victimized. So\nfar the company has not released any information.\n\nWhatever the company discovers during its investigation, along with its decision on whether\nor not is should pay the $6 million ransom will prove quite educational for other media firms\nwho may find themselves victimized in a similar manner.\n\nAs with most ransomware situations, the consensus on whether or not the victim should pay\nup was split. If the data is deemed more valuable than the ransom and it cannot be\nreplicated than breaking out the corporate check book might be in order, but otherwise, if at\nall possible, the bad guys should not be paid off.\n\n“It's a business decision, plain and simple. If an attacker was threatening to release the new\nStar Wars movie early, I'd want to understand the business impact of that. If it meant that\nthere would be a decrease in people attending movies or buying merchandise in dollar\namounts that exceeded the amount of the ransom, I'd at least consider coming to the table\nand negotiating,” said James Carder, CISO of LogRhythm.\n\nHowever, everyone did agree that snatching IP was a smart move as it forces the company\nto quickly make a decision over what is essentially a product with an expiration date. And\nthey did not rule out that despite asking for money the hacker could have an ulterior motive,\none similar to the Sony hack that was focused on damaging the studio for the release of the\nanti-North Korea movie “The Interview.”\n\n\n-----\n\nIntellectual property is particularly well suited to ransomware attacks because there is little\nway to repair the damage after it has been released. In the case of movies and/or episodes,\nthere is an immediate diminution in market value,” Keller said.\n\nWilliams agreed, adding the negative consequences of pre-releasing brand defining IP can\nbe tremendous with the possibility of subscriptions being impacted in HBO's case.\n\nCarder did add that if a company manages to save a few dollars in negotiating to pay a lower\nransom it would be smart to take that money and invest in boosting its cybersecurity. And he\nhad a few suggestions on where to invest with the most important point made being the\namount the company invests should be near the equivalent to the value of what it is trying to\nprotect.\n\n“Unfortunately, there isn't a silver bullet or one thing these studios can do. It's a combination\nof things that must happen. Studios must practice good IT and security hygiene (patching\nsystems and applications, updating and modernizing systems/applications/infrastructure,\ncontrolling access to only those that need access, validating identities, encrypting or applying\nother safeguards to critical business systems and data). They also must implement stringent\nmonitoring and alerting mechanisms as compensating controls for when or if an attacker\nbreaks through their defenses,” Carder said.\n\nWilliams noted that even improving some basic security protocols would be a huge help. The\nfirst change he suggested is to stop relying on passwords as a line of defense to protect\nintellectual property. Next is to implement multifactor authentication and utilize machine\nlearning to halts attacks as they happen.\n\nWhile there are many things companies must do to increase security, the one thing they\ncannot do is underestimate their enemies, said Matthew Pascucci, Cybersecurity Practice\nManager at CCSI.\n\n\"The HBO hack should be taken seriously. Anytime a malicious actor has your sensitive data\nand is releasing it to the public they've earned the right to be taken serious. How HBO\nresponds to their demands and moves forward with the isolation of the incident will\ndetermine what needs to be done moving forward from a hardening and process\nperspective,” he said.\n\nIn the end it may be hard to discern what will be the final result of this attack. HBO may\ndetermine how it was done, but unless it publicly states that it paid, or the hacker makes\nsuch a disclosure, the world may not know. Unlike the NotPetya attack, which has negatively\nimpacted the financials of FedEx and Maersk, HBO may pass through this incident\nunscathed. Especially if it enters into a negotiation with Mr. Smith.\n\n“Just like with any business deal, there could be some level of negotiation and potentially\nsome agreements made if HBO thinks that the stolen data has considerable value from a\nbusiness perspective By comparison if you look at the effects of Sony's breach there was\n\n\n-----\n\nreally no material impact on Sony s fiscal results the year it was breached. Most of the cost\nincurred was associated with the investigation and the remediation necessary to bolster their\ncybersecurity program, which could be seen as an investment in the long run,” Carder said.\n\nDoug [Olenick](https://www.scmagazine.com/author/doug-olenick)\n\n## Related\n\n\n-----",
