This analysis has identified a shared object dimension and shared obfuscation methods across weaponized RTF files utilized by the APT\ngroups known as Sidewinder (Indian State Interests), Goblin Panda/Conimes (Chinese State Interests), Temp.Periscope/ APT40 / Leviathan (Chinese\nState Interests), and Temp.Trident / Dagger Panda & Nomad Panda / Icefog (Chinese State Interests). Both unique object dimensions and multiple\nshared obfuscation methods are visible in the RTF files which appear to be artifacts of a shared RTF phishing weaponizer. In addition to shared RTF\nproperties, a distinct pattern of post-exploitation TTP’s is shared between the APT groups aligned with China, whereas a unique post-exploitation\nexecution chain can be seen in Sidewinder APT campaigns. The use of a common RTF phishing weaponizer alongside distinct post-exploitation\nTTPs introduces the possibility that Chinese and Indian APTs may have an overlapping supply chain for the acquisition of exploits and phishing\nweaponizers. However, after these tools are acquired a distinct and complex network of APT digital quartermasters may determine how these tools\nare equipped with payloads and deployed in distinct operations.\n\n## Using Object Dimensions to Track RTF Phishing Weaponizers\n\nRTF files are among the most popular file formats used in phishing attacks today. To create a weaponized RTF file capable of exploiting a common\nvulnerability exploit (“CVE”), RTF weaponizers are often used which consist of a script that injects a malicious RTF object into a pre-crafted RTF\nphishing document. The resulting weaponized exploit file can then be attached to a phishing email and sent to a victim. When RTF weaponizers are\nacquired or purchased, it is common for operators to change aspects of the weaponizer payload which occurs after initial CVE exploitation.\nHowever, it is less common for operators to change the object header and dimensions within the RTF Weaponizer, resulting in shared unique\nobject dimensions across weaponized exploits created by adversaries. Object dimensions are represented in the RTF strings as “\\objhN” for height\nand “\\objwN” for width. Analysts can identify related samples with matching unique object dimensions by hunting for samples with object\ndimensions sharing these properties.\n\n[RTF 1.14 Specification](http://ftp.artifax.net/ArtRep/2.0/Help/rtf.htm)\n\nAnomali Labs identified a unique object dimension present in RTF phishing files weaponized with CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802 which\nappear to be utilized by numerous Asian APT groups. The identified RTFs all share a unique object height and width, which determine how the\nobject will be rendered in Microsoft Word. Specifically the object dimensions “objw2180\\objh300” are present in the RTF files and have been\nobserved in phishing files linked to the APT groups Sidewinder, Goblin Panda, Temp.Periscope, and Temp.Trident.\n\nAdditionally, object data present in the RTF files were shared between a number of samples utilized by these groups. There are multiple RTF\nobfuscation strings constant among these samples which is a byproduct of the obfuscation utilized by the RTF Weaponizer. This shared obfuscation\noutput enforces the likelihood of this phishing weaponizer being utilized by multiple actors and possibly originating from an overlapping supply\nchain.\n\n|Col1|anomali.com/blog/analyzing-digital-quartermasters-in-asia-do-chinese-and-indian-apts-have-a-shared-supply-chain|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nwere identified during an investigation into Sidewinder APT activity. This activity was later attributed to the Goblin Panda / Conimes group .2\n\n## Distinct Execution Techniques\n\nDespite all identified APT samples sharing unique RTF object dimensions and obfuscation methods, two distinct methods covered at length below\nfor executing payloads were found. The Sidewinder APT downloads and executes a payload via an HTA file and the three clusters of Chinese APT\nactivity drop shellcode via an OLE package which pulls down a source file for payload execution.\n\nThe Sidewinder APT has historically targeted organizations linked to the Pakistani Military and is believed by security researchers to be an actor\nassociated with Indian espionage interests possibly operating as a contractor in the space. Sidewinder has conducted campaigns targeting\nWindows and Android-based systems. Their use of weaponized RTF files with unique object dimensions in phishing campaigns rely on the\nsuccessful exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 in which the opened RTF file downloads and executes HTA files on the victim’s machine . Primarily3\nEnglish language phishing files that invoke topics involving the military borders of India, China, and Pakistan are weaponized and require execution\nby the victim to pull down additional files including a malicious .hta. Once the .hta has been downloaded from a C2 domain and executed, the\npowershell payload contained in the .hta file can then be executed on a victim’s system .4\n\nAlternatively, three distinct clusters of Chinese APT activity have been observed utilizing these RTF files sharing unique object dimensions. Goblin\nPanda / Conimes has historically targeted Vietnam utilizing RTF phishing attachments delivering a payload identified as “QCRat” . Temp.Periscope /5\nAPT40 / Leviathan has historically targeted U.S. and international institutions associated with naval and maritime issues affecting the South China\nSea while supporting the theft of intellectual property . Temp.Trident / Dagger Panda & Nomad Panda / Icefog have historically targeted the6\nMongolia region (Dagger Panda) alongside Russian and Central Asia (Nomad Panda) likely as part of economic espionage efforts in support of the\nBelt and Road Initiative . Versions of the custom payload Fucobha have been identified as part of these campaigns, which was first identified in7\n2013 . In addition to these distinct APTs using a common RTF weaponizer, they share a common post-exploitation execution technique. Rather than8\ndownloading and executing a malicious file, the RTF document drops and executes shellcode via an OLE package that then drops a distinctive\nsource file to execute a payload. This method has been identified earlier by security analysts . Anomali Labs identified the presence of the unique9\nobject dimension \"objw871\\\\objh811\\\\objscalex8\\\\objscaley8” in RTF files involved with this post-exploitation method. This object dimension can\nbe used to identify multiple malicious RTF files attributed to Chinese APT groups. The presence of both a shared phishing weaponizer and a shared\npost-exploitation execution technique between these groups is indicative of a noteworthy tool and TTP overlap. This overlap indicates that these\nAPT groups may be part of a shared supply chain which receives tools for phishing exploitation from a shared Digital Quartermaster.\n\n|Actor|Targeting|Potential Motivation|Methodology|Unique Tools|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Goblin Panda a.k.a. Conimes|Vietnam and Southeast Asia|Espionage aligned with commercial and South China Sea issues|RTF Phishing followed by shellcode executed via an OLE package dropping distinctive source file|QCRat Payload|\n|Temp.Periscope a.k.a APT40 a.k.a Leviathan|U.S. Defense; Maritime; Academic Institutions; International & Political organizations|Intellectual property theft and military espionage|RTF Phishing followed by shellcode executed via an OLE package dropping distinctive source file|DADBOD EVILTECH AIRBREAK HOMEFRY MURKYTOP|\n|Nomad Panda & Dagger Panda a.k.a Temp.Trident a.k.a.Icefog|Mongolia and Central Asia|Economic espionage for Belt & Road Initiative|RTF Phishing followed by shellcode executed via an OLE package dropping distinctive source file|Fucobha Payload|\n\n\n## Timeline of Activity - Temporal Indicators\n\nThe earliest public sample (c92a26c42c5fe40bd343ee94f5022e05647876daa9b9d76a4eeb8a89b7f7103d) of a CVE-2017-11882 RTF exploit\ndocument matching these identified object dimensions and using the Chinese post-exploitation execution technique contains a last modified date\nof November 18, 2017. Two samples attributed to Temp.Periscope contain last modified dates from 2007 that appear to be manipulated and\ntherefore cannot be accurately dated based on this information. The first identified RTF samples can be attributed to Temp.Periscope with Goblin\nPanda later beginning to utilize these RTF files in phishing campaigns circa January 2018. Temp.Trident appears to have begun using these RTF files\nin late February 2018 based on publicly available samples. Notably the Sidewinder APT RTF phishing samples were observed in the wild\nsubsequent to use by Chinese APT groups with samples not observed until April 4, 2018 based on last modified dates of public samples. Most\nrecently a sample was identified in October 2018.\n\nWhile CVE-2017-11882 was the primary RTF exploit observed between November 2017 and September 2018, a shift in TTPs was observed with an\nupdated weaponizer targeting CVE-2018-0802. Subsequent to October 23, 2018. RTF phishing files attributed to Chinese APT groups and containing\nthese unique object dimensions shifted their TTPs to target this new CVE. The targeted vulnerability is highly similar to CVE-2017-11882 and proof\nof concepts have been released which effectively target both vulnerabilities with minimal changes to the exploit code. No Sidewinder APT samples\ntargeting CVE-2018-0802 were publicly identified at the time of analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion: Are Exploits Being Traded from the Royal Road or Imperial Highway?\n\nThe presence of unique RTF object dimensions, object data strings indicative of shared obfuscation methods, and shared post-exploitation TTP’s\namongst Chinese APT groups indicate that a shared RTF phishing weaponizer may be in use by multiple adversaries in the APAC region. The\nconstancy of the object dimensions and object data across APT groups, despite weaponzier updates targeting new CVE’s, reinforces the shared\nnature of this tool. The distribution of a shared weaponizer for phishing is consistent with historic reporting regarding the Goblin Panda APT that\npreviously utilized a shared phishing weaponizer for CVE-2012-0158. Additionally, the practice of utilizing a shared Digital Quartermaster and\nphishing builder was previously observed across Chinese APT campaigns unrelated to these actors as early as 2013. This provides a historic\nprecedent for tool sharing of this kind10. The shared post-exploitation methods used by Temp.Periscope, Temp.Trident, and Goblin Panda, when\nexamined in context of this shared RTF phishing weaponizer, supports a conclusion that these APTs may share a common supply chain and Digital\nQuartermaster.\n\nAlternatively, analysis indicating this RTF phishing weaponizer overlaps with the otherwise unrelated Sidewinder APT campaigns raises a larger\nquestion about tool acquisition by APTs in the APAC region. Although not confirmed at this time, this occurrence could indicate that Indian &\nChinese APT groups are using an overlapping supply chain for exploits. Similar supply chains have been known to consist of an ecosystem of\nunderground exploit brokers and weaponizer developers providing tools to an exclusive list of clientele. However, despite the apparent overlap,\nthis analysis has not determined if this RTF weaponizer originated in India, in China, or elsewhere. Publicly observed samples indicate that tool\nadoption was first seen by the Chinese group Temp.Periscope, with Goblin Panda, and Temp.Trident following suit prior to usage by the\nSidewinder APT. While it is possible that this temporal adoption may indicate context about the weaponizer’s origin, unlike the ancient trading\nroads that have historically connected India and China, the current exchange of offensive cyber tools remains opaque. Further research is\nnecessary at this time to substantiate the possibility of an active shared APT supply chain in the APAC region.\n\nAnomali Labs has developed the following Yara signatures that
