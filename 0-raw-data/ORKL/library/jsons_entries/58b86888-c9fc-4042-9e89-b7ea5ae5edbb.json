As of this writing, a number of researchers have linked the\nactivity to the suspected North Korean-affiliated “Lazarus Group” due to similarities in the\ncode and the infrastructure. Flashpoint analysts conducted similar analyses, but also\nincluded a linguistic and cultural review of the 28 ransom notes found within the WannaCry\nmalware to determine the native tongue of the author(s).\n\nSince the May 12, 2017, “WannaCry” ransomware worm attack, researchers have struggled\nwith the question of attribution. As of this writing, a number of researchers have linked the\nactivity to the suspected North Korean-affiliated “Lazarus Group” due to similarities in the\ncode and the infrastructure. Flashpoint analysts conducted similar analyses, but also\nincluded a linguistic and cultural review of the 28 ransom notes found within the WannaCry\nmalware to determine the native tongue of the author(s).\n\n\n-----\n\n## Analysis\n\nFlashpoint analyzed each of the notes individually for content, accuracy, and style, and then\ncompared results. Analysts also compared the ransom notes to previous ransom messages\nassociated with other ransomware samples to determine if there was reuse. Unsurprisingly,\nthere are many similarities, but an exact match was not found. The WannaCry samples\nanalyzed by Flashpoint contained language configuration files with translated ransom\nmessages for the following languages:\n\n1. Bulgarian\n2. Chinese (Simplified)\n3. Chinese (Traditional)\n4. Croatian\n5. Czech\n6. Danish\n7. Dutch\n8. English\n9. Filipino\n10. Finnish\n11. French\n12. German\n13. Greek\n14. Indonesian\n15. Italian\n16. Japanese\n17. Korean\n18. Latvian\n19. Norwegian\n20. Polish\n21. Portuguese\n22. Romanian\n23. Russian\n24. Slovak\n25. Spanish\n26. Swedish\n27. Turkish\n28. Vietnamese\n\nImage 1: WannaCry ransom note in English.Image 1: WannaCry ransom note in English.\nAnalysis revealed that nearly all of the ransom notes were translated using Google Translate\nand that only three, the English version and the Chinese versions (Simplified and\nTraditional), are likely to have been written by a human instead of machine translated.\n\n\n-----\n\nThough the English note appears to be written by someone with a strong command of\nEnglish, a glaring grammatical error in the note suggest the speaker is non-native or perhaps\npoorly educated.\n\nFlashpoint found that the English note was used as the source text for machine translation\ninto the other languages. Comparisons between the Google translated versions of the\nEnglish ransomware note to the corresponding WannaCry ransom note yielded nearly\nidentical results, producing a 96% or above match.\n\nImage 2: Percent identical by word count between Google translate and WannaCry note\nversions.\n**_Image 2: Percent identical by word count between Google translate and WannaCry note_**\n_versions._\n\n## Chinese Ransomware Notes\n\nThe two Chinese ransom notes differ substantially from other notes in content, format, and\ntone. Google Translate fails in both Chinese-English and English-Chinese tests, producing\ninaccurate results that suggests the Chinese text was likely not have been similarly\ngenerated by the English text.\n\nA number of unique characteristics in the note indicate it was written by a fluent Chinese\nspeaker. A typo in the note, “帮组” (bang zu) instead of “帮助” (bang zhu) meaning “help,”\nstrongly indicates the note was written using a Chinese-language input system rather than\nbeing translated from a different version. More generally, the note makes use of proper\ngrammar, punctuation, syntax, and character choice, indicating the writer was likely native or\nat least fluent. There is, however, at least one minor grammatical error which may be\nexplained by autocomplete, or a copy-editing error.\n\nThe text uses certain terms that further narrow down a geographic location. One term, “礼拜”\nfor “week,” is more common in South China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore; although it\nis occasionally used in other regions of the country. The other “杀毒软件” for “anti-virus” is\nmore common in the Chinese mainland.\n\nPerhaps most compelling, the Chinese note contains substantial content not present in any\nother version of the note, is lengthier, and differs slightly in format.\n\nImage 3: The Simplified Chinese ransom note with key areas highlighted.Image 3: The\n_Simplified Chinese ransom note with key areas highlighted._\n\n## Conclusions\n\n\n-----\n\nFlashpoint assesses with high confidence that the author(s) of WannaCry s ransomware\nnotes are fluent in Chinese, as the language used is consistent with that of Southern China,\nHong Kong, Taiwan, or Singapore. Flashpoint also assesses with high confidence that the\nauthor(s) are familiar with the English language, though not native. This alone is not enough\nto determine the nationality of the author(s).\n\nImage 4: Assessed genesis of the WannaCry ransom notes.Image 4: Assessed genesis of\n_the WannaCry ransom notes._\nFlashpoint assesses with moderate confidence that the Chinese ransom note served as the\noriginal source for the English version, which then generated machine translated versions of\nthe other notes. The Chinese version contains content not in any of the others, though no\nother notes contain content not in the Chinese. The relative familiarity found in the Chinese\ntext compared to the others suggests the authors were fluent in the language—perhaps\ncomfortable enough to use the language to write the initial note.\n\nGiven these facts, it is possible that Chinese is the author(s)’ native tongue, though other\nlanguages cannot be ruled out. It is also possible that the malware author(s)’ intentionally\nused a machine translation of their native tongue to mask their identity. It is worth noting that\ncharacteristics marking the Chinese note as authentic are subtle. It is thus possible, though\nunlikely, that they were intentionally included to mislead.\n\n\n-----",
