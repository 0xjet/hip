Ransomware attacks are no longer reserved events. Companies are at a constant threat to their revenue, data, brand, image, and\nsubsequent shutdown of the business.\n\n**Redeemer ransomware was initially identified in June 2021, and since then, four public versions (1.0, 1.5, 1.7, and 2.0) have been released.**\nThis article contains the technical analysis of the Redeemer ransomware and its various features.\n\n## Evolution of the Redeemer Ransomware 2.0\n\nThe threat actor, Cerebrate operating on a cybercrime forum named Dread has been actively promoting the Redeemer ransomware. They\nhave recently started operating on the Breached forum and have released its latest version (version 2.0) on the same.\n\nRedeemer has gone through four version changes since September 2021. The latest version includes improved graphical features such as a\nGUI builder interface, an icon change for encrypted files, a detailed instructions list, etc. The threat actor also claims to have added support for\nWindows 11 along with few cryptographic changes to the latest version. The image below describes the features added with each version\nrelease of the Redeemer ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Modus Operandi\n\n**Using the builder executable, the attacker creates a ransomware executable.**\n\n**The attacker specifies an RSA private key file, email address for contact, XMR amount and the option to disable ‘melt’, if**\n**a crypter is being used to encrypt the ransomware. Enabling ‘melt’ will make the ransomware executable delete itself and**\n**relocate to a random directory on the system, and execute from there in a hidden state.**\n\n**Using the Generate Key Pair option, an RSA private key is generated which is sent to the Malware author (Cerebrate)**\n**along with the encrypted public key generated by the ransomware executable. The public key is received from the victim.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The Malware author (Cerebrate) will share the master key only upon having received 20% of the collected ransom**\n**amount. Thus, the victim can only decrypt their files once 20% of the ransom payment has been made by the affiliate**\n**attacker.**\n\n**[Related Read Technical Analysis of Emerging, Sophisticated Pandora Ransomware Group](https://cloudsek.com/technical-analysis-of-emerging-sophisticated-pandora-ransomware-group/)**\n\n## Details of the Ransomware\n\nThis Ransomware is written in C++ and comes with a builder and decrypter executable.\nIt uses the following encryption algorithms:\n\nAES256 is used to encrypt the files on the victim’s computer\nRSA is used to encrypt the key\nThe ransomware clones itself with the name of a system executable file (eg. conhost.exe), and creates a hidden folder for itself in the\nWindows directory.\nIt terminates all the running processes and executables which may pose a threat to the encryption routine.\nIt deletes all shadow copies of files and clears all event as well as application logs using wevtutil, vssadmin, and wbadmin.\nIt uses multithreading in order to enumerate the filesystem and encrypt files. It creates 35 different threads that point to the same\nencryption routine.\nIt also modifies the Winlogon registry value and sets it to display the ransom note. Thus, when a user logs into the machine, the ransom\nnote is displayed.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Ransomware Signature\n\nThe signature of this executable shows us that it is written in C++. When conducting the string analysis, multiple Base64 encoded strings were\nobserved, some of which get decoded to the public key used for encryption, and powershell commands. Upon decoding one of these strings,\nthe following translation was obtained: ‘Redeemer Ransomware – Your Data Is Encrypted’.\n\nSignature of the executable file indicating that it is written in C++\n\nAn\n\nencoded ransomware string\n\n### Stage I – Pre-Encryption Operations\n\n**Mutex Creation**\n\nUpon execution, Redeemer first hides its console window by using a call to the **_ShowWindow Windows API. It then creates a Mutex, called_**\nthe RedeemerMutex, in order to make sure that multiple instances of the ransomware are not running on the same system.\n\nCode\n\nfor hiding the process window and creation of the Mutex\n\n**String Encoding**\n\nAn RSA public key, ransom amount, and contact email ID are then loaded as Base64 values into memory and decoded for further usage. This\nRansomware heavily uses Base64 for string encoding purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\nCode for loading and decoding Base64 values, and storing them for later use\n\n### Stage II – Preparing for Encryption\n\nThe second stage of the ransomware is dictated by the transfer of control to a specific logic section that is controlled by the argument count\nvalue. This is done by moving itself under a different name to a world writable directory as shown in the image below.\n\nThe list of random executable and directory names\nA new instance is spawned that does the encryption. The name of the newly spawned process will be randomly chosen from the list shown in\nthe image above. The entire process breakdown is covered in the following section:\n\nThe ransomware randomly chooses the directory and executable names by using the logic shown below. It also sets the directory\nattributes to hidden using the SetFileAttributes Windows API. In this case, the directory selected is C:\\Windows\\SQL and the executable\nname is taskmgr.exe.\n\nLogic for determining the file and folder name combination\n\nNow, the ransomware executes its copy using the `ShellExecuteW` Windows API, while taking the path to the old exe as an argument.\nThis is done in order to delete its old copy and continue running as an imposter system executable, which will commence the encryption.\n\n\n-----\n\nExecuting the new executable while accepting\n\nthe old one as an argument\n\nThe routine for directory enumeration and encryption will begin only after the above argument condition is met. A check is implemented\nfor the same by counting the number of arguments passed to the executable.\n\nCode for checking the arguments and deleting the original executable if criteria is met\n\nThe new executable then runs the Windows Event Utility (wevtutil) commands using CMD in order to clear important event logs. The\n**_vssadmin and wbadmin commands are used to delete all shadow copies, backup catalogs, and system-state backups in order to make_**\nfile recovery impossible.\n\nCommands executed to clear event logs and delete shadow copies\n\nThe ransomware terminates executables and services (including security applications) which might hinder the encryption operations. The\ncode for this is hardcoded in the program as Base64 strings which are decoded using the taskkill and net stop commands. (Refer to the\nList of Executables & Services Terminated by the Ransomware)\n\nCommands used to terminate executable\n\nand services which might hinder encryption\n\n\n-----\n\ne a so a e a so ed ts t e `So t a e\\\\` `c oso t\\\\` `do s` `\\\\Cu` `e t e s o \\\\` `ogo` `/st o g` eg st y ey, od es\nthe `LegalNoticeCaption  and` `LegalNoticeText` values, and sets them to the ransom note. Thus, when a user logs in, the\nransom note is displayed.\nThe ransomware also creates an exception list so that it does not encrypt the following:\n\nSystem and OS directories\nRedeemer ransomware (i.e itself)\nRansom note\nAlready encrypted files\n\nCode highlighting the\n\nskipped extensions and files\n\n[Related YourCyanide: An Investigation into ‘The Frankenstein’ Ransomware that Sends Malware Laced Love Letters](https://cloudsek.com/yourcyanide-an-investigation-into-the-frankenstein-ransomware-that-sends-malware-laced-love-letters/)\n\n### Encryption\n\nRedeemer is capable of enumerating and encrypting both local files and network-attached drives.\n\nThe ransomware encryption loop\n\nIt enumerates local drives using the following `GetLogicalDrives Windows APIs:`\n\nFor the local files, it uses `SHGetFolderPath`\nFor network assets, it uses `WNetEnumResource .`\n\nIt executes these operations using a loop with `FindFirstFile and` `FindNextFile .`\n\n\n-----\n\nEnumeration of local and network files and folders\n\nIt should be noted that this ransomware uses multithreading for encryption, which makes it efficient in terms of CPU usage. It creates 35\ndifferent threads, each pointing to the encryption routine.\n\nScreenshot of the threads created by Redeemer\n\nIt initializes the ransom note in Base64 and writes the decoded value to a file named `Read Me.TXT.` The encrypted files are saved with the\n\n`.redeem` extension.\n\nScreenshot of encrypted file names\n\n## Ransom Collection\n\nWhen an encrypted file is clicked by the user/victim, the following message is displayed.\n\nScreenshot of the message displayed upon opening an encrypted file\n\nThe ReadMe.TXT file containing the ransom note is displayed in the image below.\n\n\n-----\n\nScreenshot of the ransom note (Read Me.TXT)\n\nTo decrypt their files, the victims are asked to pay the demanded ransom amount in Monero.\nOnce the ransom payment is verified, the victim receives a decryption tool and a key which allows them to restore their files.\n\n[Read Also Analysis and Attribution of the Eternity Ransomware: Timeline and Emergence of the Eternity
