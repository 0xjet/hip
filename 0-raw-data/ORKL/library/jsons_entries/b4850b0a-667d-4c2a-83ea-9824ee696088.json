    "plain_text": "# Flowspec – TA505’s bulletproof hoster of choice\n\n**intel471.com/blog/bulletproof-hoster-of-choice**\n\nJul 15, 2020\n\nBy the Intel 471 Intelligence Analysis team.\n\nHere at Intel 471 we spend a fair amount of time tracking malicious infrastructure providers.\nIn the world of cybercrime the malicious infrastructure provider, or Bulletproof Hoster\n(BPH) as they are called in the underground marketplace, is a core enabling service that often\ngets little attention from threat intelligence analysts. It’s difficult to quantify their impact as\nit’s often spread over the activities of many different clients that are conducting activities that\nrange from low-level phishing to more sophisticated intrusions. Sure, IP addresses and\ndomains associated with badness get pushed over to the NOC/SOC, SIEM or endpoints to\nprotect the enterprise, but few are digging beyond the initial incident and indicators then\nworking up the chain to prefixes, Autonomous System Numbers (ASN) or even the\ncompanies behind them.\n\nAs you divert your attention to the malicious infrastructure provider and move up this chain,\nyou’re dealing with aspects of the bad guy’s business model that are more costly to put in\nplace and thus change less frequently. You’re also allowing for opportunities to identify, track\nand proactively block clusters of infrastructure that, while not yet used for malicious activity,\nhave been set aside for such badness. In this blog we’ll start with some infrastructure\nsuspected to be in use by TA505 and make the case for blocking the entire associated prefix\nas well as using BGP announcements to monitor for future indications of infrastructure being\nput in place.\n\nThrough the course of our research we’ve identified a couple of IPs addresses suspected to\nhave been used in secondary activity by TA505, so if you’re seeing these then it means you’ve\npotentially got some big problems.\n```\n176.121.14.175\n176.121.14.238\n\n```\nThese are a bit more significant to TA505 operations than Get2 Loader malware\ninfrastructure, which are used early on as part of the initial infection. Get2 Loader is widely\nthought to be the loader operated by TA505 early on in their intrusions. This infrastructure\nwill typically see more frequent turnover given its position in the chain, but the same exercise\ncan be done with those domains & IPs as well…and it’s worth doing.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen looking at an IP address there are few red flags that should get your attention. It s\ncertainly not a perfect science, but they do offer indications you may be dealing with BPH\ninfrastructure set aside to support malicious activity.\n\n1. Things to look out for include:\n2. The associated company is registered to an offshore location such as Belize, Seychelles,\n\nPanama or others;\n3. The company was registered in the last 1-3 years;\n4. The associated ASNs were created in the last 1-3 years;\n\n5. There are only a small number (1 – 6) prefixes associated with the ASN;\n6. The prefixes associated with the ASN are smaller (/22 to /24);\n\n7. The ASN has a small number (1 – 2) of peers (as in BGP peering);\n8. Little or no benign content is hosted within the infrastructure;\n9. The organization maintains a presence in the underground marketplace…obvious\n\ngiveaway!\n\nTo give a quick and simple example we’ll start with the two IPs mentioned above as being\nassociated with TA505 activity. The first thing we want to understand is the smallest prefix\nannouncement and routing history associated with the IP address. That’s pretty easy using\nRIPE’s free tool RIPEStat. The key takeaways from the screens below are that both IPs have\nbeen part of 176.121.14.0/24 since mid-2018 and it is currently announced by AS210138.\nAlso, this prefix provides a fairly small number of IP addresses — 256 to be exact.\n\n[https://stat.ripe.net/widget/routing-history#w.resource=176.121.14.175](https://stat.ripe.net/widget/routing-history#w.resource=176.121.14.175)\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can also use RIPEStat to understand the routing history for AS210138. This will provide\nyou information related to what other prefixes have been and are being announced under a\nparticular Autonomous System (AS). What we can see is that AS210138 has only announced\nthe subject /24 IPv4 prefix since October 2019 and the IPv6 /48 since in April 2020. If you\nwere confident an ASN was controlled by a malicious infrastructure provider you could make\nthe case for blocking any prefixes associated with it currently and in the future.\n\n[https://stat.ripe.net/widget/routing-history#w.resource=AS210138](https://stat.ripe.net/widget/routing-history#w.resource=AS210138)\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can look further into the ASN, the parent organization, and more using the RIPE\ndatabase and other tools, but that’s beyond the scope of this blog. We’ll stick to three RIPE\nobjects (person, organization and ASN) that provide some pretty decent insight into the AS\nand those that control it.\n\n[https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=ripe&key=AS210138&type=aut-num](https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=ripe&key=AS210138&type=aut-num)\n\n\n-----\n\nhttps://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=ripe&key=ORG-FL235RIPE&type=organisation\n\nhttps://apps.db.ripe.net/db-webui/lookup?\nsource=RIPE&type=person&key=NS7363\n-RIPE\n\nThe information gleaned from the RIPE\nDB and from RIPEStat is somewhat more\nreliable than domain WHOIS as it can’t\nall simply contain dummy data and some\nof it is related to BGP, which needs to be\nlegitimate if you’re going to play on the\ninternet. To summarize some of the info\nwe’ve pulled together:\n\nBoth IPs are part of 176.121.14.0/24,\nwhich is a relatively small netblock of 256 IP addresses\nThe prefix falls under ASN 210138, which was created on Oct 2, 2019\nThe AS first announced 176.121.14.0/24 on Oct 12, 2019\nThe prefix and ASN are associated with a company called Flowspec LTD\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, we consider the question of whether or\nnot this particular organization is catering\nits services to cybercriminals directly in the\nunderground marketplace. A quick look\nacross a number of forums will show that\nFlowspec is operating in plain sight and\nclearly offering bulletproof hosting services.\nIt’s not always this easy to answer this\nquestion, however.\n\nWe’ve taken an abbreviated look at Flowspec’s setup, but what we can conclude is that TA505\nare likely active in the underground marketplace and using the BPH services of Flowspec. It’s\na safe bet to also conclude that nothing good is coming out of Flowspec’s /24 and it’s more or\nless set aside for nefarious activity. TA505, a somewhat sophisticated adversary, are just one\nof a number of clients so to block that /24 will also help defend against any other badness\noriginating from Flowspec.\n\n## So what can we do about it?\n\nCourse of action (COA) analysis must take into account your organization’s capabilities, but\nbelow are a number of simple COAs that might make this sort of research and analysis\nactionable for your organization.\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Block/alert on all 256 IPs associated with 176.121.14.0/24. The prefix is owned and\n\noperated by a known BPH service. One of the service’s clients is TA505. Better yet,\nblacklist the ASN and any prefixes associated with it.\n2. Monitor the 176.121.14.0/24 for BGP announcements that would suggest it is being\n\nremoved from Flowspec or moved to another entity. This could indicate the prefix is no\nlonger used as part of the BPH service or has been transferred to a new entity under the\nservice’s control.\n3. Monitor BGP announcements for Flowspec’s ASN to identify new prefixes being added\n\nso you can immediately block/alert on them.\n4.
