Despite\na -24% decrease in botnet C&C activity between January\nand June 2024, China was still hosting more botnet\nC&Cs (2,823) than any other country. Nevertheless,\nlet’s hope this downtrend continues.\n\n\n### Decreases across the globe\n\n\nMost regions, including the aforementioned China (-24%),\nexperienced a decrease in the number of botnet C&Cs, with\nthe exception of Bulgaria (+162%), Sweden (+52%), Mexico\n(+33%) and Russia (+24%). Meanwhile, India, Poland and\nSwitzerland departed from the Top 20.\n\n\n### What’s happening in Bulgaria?\n\n\nAfter reporting a +227% increase in Q4 2023, Bulgaria\nshows no signs of curtailing this malicious activity.\nThe number of botnet C&Cs hosted in the country\ncontinued to increase, reaching 715, placing them at #6\nin this Top 20.\n\n\n### Highs and lows for Latin America\n\n\nNew entrants Argentina and Colombia joined the Top 20\nrankings at #13 and #16, respectively. Meanwhile, Mexico\nadvanced five places to #7, with a +33% increase, reaching\n497 botnet C&Cs.

Furthermore, it was\n\nCobalt Strike is a legitimate\n\nassociated with 93% more botnet C&Cs than its closest\n\ncommercial penetration testing tool\n\ncontender, Flubot, at #2.\n\nthat allows an attacker to deploy\n\n\n### Is Flubot not dead?\n\n\nAs we’ve discussed in previous publications, FluBot\nuses a “FastFlux” technique to host its botnet C&Cs. The\nsame botnet infrastructure also serves as C&Cs for other\nmalware families, such as TeamBot. To make our internal\ntracking easier, we continue to label the associated\ninfrastructure as FluBot, but this is effectively hosting all\nkinds of other botnet C&C badness.\n\n### RATs are on the rise\n\nRemote Access Trojans (RATs), accounting for 28.53% of\nmalware, were the second most popular type associated\nwith botnet C&C servers. This malware type is designed\nto enable attackers to control an infected computer\nremotely. Once the RAT is operating, the attacker can\nsend commands to the compromised system to receive\ndata in response. The most prevalent RAT this reporting\nperiod was DCRat, which saw a +72% increase between\nJanuary and June 2024.\n\n### Android backdoors increase in popularity\n\nThe number of botnet C&Cs associated with android\nbackdoors amounted to only 8.58% between July and\nDecember 2023; however, over the last six months that\npercentage rose to 20.01%. This is partially due to new\nentrants Hook (#7) and Coper (#19), but is predominantly\ncomprised of Flubot associated infrastructure.\n\n### Endgame for IcedID and Pikabot\n\n[This May we saw “Operation Endgame” and the](https://www.spamhaus.org/resource-hub/malware/operation-endgame-botnets-disrupted-after-international-action/)\ntakedown of several botnets, including IcedID and\nPikabot. Therefore, it will come as no surprise to see\nthese malware families drop out of the Top 20 malware\nassociated with botnet C&Cs this reporting period.\nGreat to see onward impact from this global operation!\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware associated with botnet C&Cs,  Jan-Jun 2024 (continued)\n\n\n### Malware families associated with botnet C&Cs\n\n\n**Rank** **Jul - Dec**\n\n**2023**\n\n\n**Jan - Jun**\n\n**2024**\n\n\n**% Change** **Malware Family** **Description**\n\n\n**#1** 5,628 3,348 -41% Cobalt Strike Pentest Framework\n\n**#2** 1,159 1,727 49% Flubot Android Backdoor\n\n**#3** 1,083 1,020 -6% AsyncRAT Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#4** 426 733 72% DCRat Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#5** 670 729 9% Remcos Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#6** 800 665 -17% Sliver Pentest Framework\n\n**#7** - 470 New entry Hook Android Backdoor\n\n**#8** - 379 New entry Mirai DDoS Bot\n\n**#9** 406 374 -8% QuasarRAT Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#10** 942 307 -67% Qakbot Backdoor\n\n**#11** 200 301 51% FakeUpdates Loader/Downloader\n\n**#12** 559 280 -50% RedLineStealer Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#13** - 201 New entry Latrodectus Loader/Downloader\n\n**#14** - 197 New entry BianLian Ransomware\n\n**#15** 140 163 16% Havoc Pentest Framework\n\n**#16** - 134 New entry RisePro Credential Stealer\n\n**#17** 167 128 -23% NjRAT Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#18** 98 103 5% Rhadamanthys Credential Stealer\n\n**#19** - 92 New entry Coper Android Backdoor\n\n**#20** - 88 New entry Bashlite DDoS Bot\n\n\n**0** **1000** **2000** **3000** **4000**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware type comparisons\n\n0.00%\n\nRansomware\n\n1.72%\n\n0.00%\n\nDDoS Bot\n\n4.08%\n\nLoader/ 1.48%\nDownlaoder 4.39%\n\nPentest 49.39%\nFramework 36.51%\n\n8.54%\n\nBackdoor\n\n2.68%\n\nRemote Access 25.22%\nTrojan (RAT) 28.53%\n\n8.58%\n\nAndroid Backdoor\n\n20.01%\n\n6.06%\n\nCredential Stealer\n\n2.07%\n\n0.73%\n\nSpambot\n\n0.00%\n\n**0%** **10%** **20%** **30%** **40%** **50%**\n\nJul-Dec 2023 Jan-Jun 2024\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused top-level domains,  Jan-Jun 2024\n\n### Interpreting the data  \n\nRegistries with a greater number of active domains\nhave greater exposure to abuse. For example, between\nJanuary and June 2024, .com had more than 155m\n\n**a brief overview**\n\ndomains, of which 0.00129% were associated with botnet\nC&Cs. Meanwhile, .sbs had approximately 721k domains,\nof which 0.03172% were associated with botnet C&Cs.\n\n**Generic TLDs (gTLDs)**\n\nBoth are in the top five of our listings. Still, one had a\nmuch higher percentage of domains related to botnet\nC&Cs than the other.\n\n### .sbs in at #5 \n\nAfter a fleeting visit in Q3 2023, generic top-level\n[domain (gTLD), .sbs, owned by Shortdot, shot back into](https://www.spamhaus.org/resource-hub/service-providers/we-hope-you-keep-sbs-clean-shortdot/)\n[the Top 20 at #5 with a +252% increase. With prices starting](https://tld-list.com/tld/sbs)\n[as low as $0.90 (at the time of writing), it’s no surprise](https://tld-list.com/tld/sbs)\nthis gTLD is a botnet hotbed. Clearly, this TLD is still not\nliving up to its value proposition “where people cultivate\nunbiased mindsets” and “public interest agendas meet\nmeaningful actions.”\n\n### Increases for .online\n\nHaving re-entered the charts in Q4 2023, Radix-owned\n\n**New entries**\n\ngTLD, .online, increased by +280% between January\nand June 2024, ranking #2 in the Top 20 most abused\ntop-level domains. Another TLD owned by the same\n\nspace (#20).\n\nregistry, .store, also entered the Top 20 this period at\n#4, with 232 newly registered botnet C&C domains\n\n**Departures**\n\nobserved on it.\n\npw, rest.\n\n### Working together with the industry for  a safer internet\n\nNaturally, we prefer no TLDs to have botnet C&Cs linked\nwith them, but we live in the real world and understand\nthere will always be abuse. What is crucial is that abuse is\ndealt with quickly. Where necessary, if domain names are\nregistered solely for distributing malware or hosting botnet\nC&Cs, we would like registries to suspend these domain\nnames. We greatly appreciate the efforts of many registries\nwho work with us to ensure these actions are taken.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused top-level domains,  Jan-Jun 2024 (continued)\n\n\n### Top abused TLDs - number of domains\n\n\n**Rank** **Jul - Dec**\n\n**2023**\n\n\n**Jan - Jun**\n\n**2024**\n\n\n**% Change** **TLD** **Type of TLD**\n\n\n**#1** 3,103 2,013 -35% com gTLD\n\n**#2** 116 441 280% online gTLD\n\n**#3** 161 367 128% site gTLD\n\n**#4** - 232 New entry store gTLD\n\n**#5** 65 229 252% sbs gTLD\n\n**#5** 125 229 83% org gTLD\n\n**#7** 94 224 138% net gTLD\n\n**#8** 159 198 25% xyz gTLD\n\n**#9** 86 189 120% cfd gTLD\n\n**#10** 217 141 -35% top gTLD\n\n**#11** 449 122 -73% shop gTLD\n\n**#12** 125 78 -38% fun gTLD\n\n**#13** - 69 New entry website gTLD\n\n**#14** - 68 New entry cn ccTLD\n\n**#15** - 60 New entry cloud gTLD\n\n**#16** - 58 New entry tech gTLD\n\n**#17** 101 50 -50% ru ccTLD\n\n**#18** - 48 New entry co ccTLD\n\n**#18** 803 48 -94% info gTLD\n\n**#20** - 41 New entry space gTLD\n\n\n**0** **500** **1000** **1500** **2000**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused domain registrars,  Jan-Jun 2024\n\n### Namecheap #1\n\nDespite spending years in the top five, US-based\nNamecheap finally took the number one position, with\n\n**New entries**\n\na disappointing +89% increase.

We hope that the situation in Danesco Trading Ltd,\nthis region will improve before the next report publication.\n\n### Huge increases at Hostinger\n\nWe have observed an enormous +564% increase of\nnewly registered botnet C&C domains at the Lithuanianbased registrar, Hostinger, rising from 80 between July\nDecember 2023, to 531 between January and June 2024.\nNow ranking #2 in the Top 20, we hope this domain\nregistrar can stop this increase in malicious domain\nregistrations, and fast.\n\n### Tucows’ downward trend turns \n\nAfter 12 months of reductions in the number of\nbotnet C&C operators registering through them,\nTucows experienced an +11% increase during this period.\nSadly, this placed Tucows straight back in the Top 10.\n\n### Sav getting savvy to abuse? \n\nIn Q2 2023, we reported issues we were seeing at USbased registrar, Sav.
