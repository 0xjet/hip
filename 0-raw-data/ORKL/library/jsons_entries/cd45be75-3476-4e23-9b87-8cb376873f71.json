As I am always interested in new\nmalware, I took a look to see what could be discovered.\n\nAccording to the post, the hacked accounts were being used to SPAM suspicious links using\nSteam chat. These chat messages would tell the recipient to go to videomeo.pw to watch a\nvideo.\n\n**Steam Chats**\n\nWhen the target went to the page, they would be greeted with a message stating that they\nneeded to update Flash Player in order to watch the video.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fake Video Page**\n\nIf a target downloads the installer and executes it, they will find that it does not appear to do\nanything. This is because the Flash Player installer is actually a Trojan that executes a\nPowerShell script called zaga.ps1, which will download a 7-zip archive, 7-zip extractor, and a\nCMD script from the zahr.pw server.\n\n**Zaga.ps1 PowerShell Script**\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the files are downloaded, the PowerShell script will then launch the CMD file, which\nwill extract the sharchivedmngr to the %AppData%\\lappclimtfldr folderand configure\nWindows to automatically start the mcrtvclient.exe program when a user logs in. This\n[program is actually a renamed copy of the NetSupport Manager Remote Control Software.](http://www.netsupportmanager.com/)\n\nWhen the program is launched, it will connect to the NetSupport gateway at leyv.pw:11678\nand await commands. This allows the attacker to remotely connect to the infected computer\nand take control over it.\n\n**NetManager Configuration File**\n\nFor those who are concerned they are infected with this Steam Trojan, I suggest they check\nthe %AppData% folder for the specified folders.\n\n\n-----\n\nFurthermore, all users must be careful with what links they visit and what downloads they\ninstall. These days it is becoming more and more frequent for accounts to be hacked and\nthen for attackers to use them to distribute malware. Stay vigilant, be careful, and make sure\nyou have an antivirus software installed.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[Ukraine supporters in Germany targeted with PowerShell RAT malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-supporters-in-germany-targeted-with-powershell-rat-malware/)\n\n[New stealthy Nerbian RAT malware spotted in ongoing attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-stealthy-nerbian-rat-malware-spotted-in-ongoing-attacks/)\n\n[New NetDooka malware spreads via poisoned search results](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-netdooka-malware-spreads-via-poisoned-search-results/)\n\n[New Android banking malware remotely takes control of your device](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-android-banking-malware-remotely-takes-control-of-your-device/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.

Much appreciated.\n\n\n-----\n\n[blueicetwice - 5 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/835475/blueicetwice/)\n\nThank you for the excellent piece, Mr Abrams!\n\nAlso wishing you well in your bleeping lawsuit.\n\n[granada12 - 5 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/893853/granada12/)\n\nThis is a new varient. Last year one of my steam friend send me a message with a link in\nit. But it was automated not remotely operated.\n\nNever you should have your information automatically fill in or saved. You never know\nhe could send a great gift to him passing through your wallet. :p\n\n[Pugglerock - 5 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/978945/pugglerock/)\n\nIt's where the two step authentication comes in handy. I have steam on my phone for\nSteam Guard, so if someone does unfortunately manage to get a hold of my details, they\nwon't be able to log in without the code generated from my phone.\n\n\n-----\n\n[granada12 - 5 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/893853/granada12/)\n\n\"It's where the two step authentication comes in handy.

Windows 10 brilliantly comes WFO in that regard. I'm not advising anyone to\ndo the same, but I ran \"Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted\" and left it that way.\n\n[Daedalus_ - 5 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/1032190/daedalus/)\n\nWhat if I downloaded the installer on mobile but didn't run it?\n\n\n-----\n\n[Lawrence Abrams - 5 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nThen you are fine. Malware cannot hurt you unless its executed in some way.\n\n[Post a Comment Community Rules](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/posting-guidelines/)\n\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\n\n[Not a member yet?
