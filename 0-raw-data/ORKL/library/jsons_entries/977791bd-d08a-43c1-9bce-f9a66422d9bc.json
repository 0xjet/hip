However, this is only a small part of this botnet’s malicious activity. Capable\nof acting like both a computer worm and a file virus, Phorpiex is spread through exploit kits\nand with the help of other malware and has infected more than 1,000,000 Windows\ncomputers to date. By our assessment, the annual criminal revenue generated by Phorpiex\nbotnet is approximately half a million US dollars.\n\nOf course, to maintain such a large botnet, a reliable command and control (C&C)\ninfrastructure is required. For malware with a small outreach, or if infected computers are not\npart of a single botnet, virtual private servers (VPS) are most often used. VPS hosting\nservices can be purchased from legitimate companies. Many VPS hosting providers don’t\nrequire identity verification, and the services can be paid for anonymously.\n\nHowever, in the case of the Phorpiex botnet, a public VPS is not suitable. First of all, the\nC&C server for such a botnet would immediately attract attention with a large amount of\nmalicious traffic: several million requests per day from more than 100,000 unique IP\n\n\n-----\n\naddresses are sent to the Phorpiex C&C servers. By our assessment, the monthly volume of\nthe botnet’s C&C traffic may exceed 70 TB. Therefore, Phorpiex doesn’t use public VPS\nhosting services. Instead, it uses dedicated IP subnets registered to figureheads.\n\n## Botnet Architecture\n\nInitially, the Phorpiex has been known as a botnet operated using IRC protocol (also known\nas Trik). However, recent Phorpiex campaigns have switched to modular architecture and got\nrid of IRC communication. We barely saw any of its IRC C&C servers online in 2019.\nHowever, our sinkholes still indicate many thousands of hosts infected with Trik. When we\ndid spot IRC C&C servers online, we managed to capture a command for loading another\nmalware to the infected machines:\n\n**Figure 1 – Trik C&C communication dump with the decrypted URL.**\n\nWe assume that this malware, self-named Tldr (probably stands for “TrikLoader”), has\ncurrently become the core part of the Phorpiex botnet. Tldr is a downloader that uses HTTP\nprotocol for communication with C&C servers. Its main purpose is to load another malware\non the infected machines. Some Tldr samples have the functionality of a computer worm and\ncan spread through removable drives. We also observed variants of the malware that act like\na file virus infecting other software.\n\nIf necessary, malware actors can extend the functionality of the botnet by loading additional\nmodules. The image below shows the infection flow and modular architecture of the current\nbotnet.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2 – Phorpiex infection flow and architecture.**\n\nThe purpose of Tldr, and modules such as the VNC Worm and the NetBIOS Worm, is to\ndistribute the botnet as much as possible. The final goal of the Phorpiex operators is to gain\nprofit, generally in crypto-currency.\n\nThe main ways the botnet is monetized:\n\n– [Sextortion spam.](https://research.checkpoint.com/in-the-footsteps-of-a-sextortion-campaign/)\n\n– Crypto-jacking.\n\n– Crypto-currency clipping.\n\n– Providing services for loading other malware (Raccoon stealer, Predator The Thief),\ndistributing ransomware.\n\nCurrently, the Phorpiex botnet doesn’t load ransomware. After the termination of the\nGandCrab ransomware, the Phorpiex botnet completely switched to sending sextortion spam\nemails from the infected computers and loading data stealers there.\n\nWe should emphasize that almost all samples of Trik and Tldr include crypto-clipper\nfunctionality. Addresses of all crypto wallets consist of a long combination of digits and\nletters. The only way to transfer crypto-currency without additional devices is to copy the\naddress to the clipboard and then insert it in a corresponding field in a wallet application. The\nmalware alters crypto wallet addresses in a clipboard, and the money is transferred to the\n\n\n-----\n\nwallet that belongs to the malware operators. Crypto-clipper functionality allows malware\noperators to gain profits without any additional effort, even when C&C servers are offline.\nBitcoin wallets used in both Trik and Tldr configurations continue to receive stolen Bitcoins\nand have collected more than 17 BTC so far.\nBotnet capacity assessment\nPhorpiex bots continuously scan domain names and IP addresses extracted from the\nconfiguration. Even if a valid C&C server responds, the malware continues to query other\nhosts. Therefore, after registering domains from different Tldr configurations, we started to\nreceive a large number of connections from Phorpiex bots. This allowed us to assess the\nprevalence of the botnet.\nDuring the past two months, we registered connections from more than 1,000,000 unique\nhosts. At any given time, an average of 15,000 bots is online, and up to 100,000 bots are\nactive daily.\n\n**Figure 3 – Number of bots online hourly.**\n\nThe botnet hosts are primarily located in Asia. The most significant parts of the botnet are\nlocated in India, China, Thailand, and Pakistan. There are also bots present in the US,\nMexico, and many African countries. Europe is almost unaffected by the botnet.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4 – Phorpiex botnet global locations.**\n\n## C&C Infrastructure\n\nAll Phorpiex modules use a hard-coded list of IP addresses and domain names for C&C\ncommunication. While most malware implements DGA, using hard-coded domain names\ndoesn’t impair the survival of the Phorpiex bots. We suppose the list of domain names is\nused as a precaution, to be able to regain control of the bots in case of the loss of C&C\nservers accessed by the IP address. The list of domain names is updated periodically. While\nmonitoring the Phorpiex campaign during 2019, we discovered more than 4,000 different\nsamples of Tldr, with approximately 300 configurations and 3297 domain names and IP\naddresses.\n\nTldr uses the same C&C servers that were used by the Trik IRC bot:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5 – Phorpiex C&C infrastructure.**\n\nCurrently, the most active IP used by the botnet for its C&C servers is 185.176.27.132 and\naddresses from the subnet 92.63.197.0/24.\n\nWe found that the subnet 92.63.197.0/24, which hosts a lot of Phorpiex C&C servers, was\n[also observed in other threats like Smoke Loader and Necurs, and used for sending phishing](https://twitter.com/suspectnetworks/status/984680582067126274)\n[and spam emails, and for port scanning.](https://www.abuseipdb.com/check-block/92.63.197.0/24)\n\nOne more interesting fact regarding this subnet is that it is registered to an individual\nentrepreneur in the Ukraine:\n\norg-name: FOP HORBAN VITALII Anatoliyovich\n\norg-type: OTHER\n\naddress: 62408, KHARKIV REGION, ELITE village, SCHOOL str. 25, AP. 26\n\n[e-mail: [email protected]](https://research.checkpoint.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\n[We found the registration data for an individual entrepreneur called “FOP HORBAN VITALII](https://work-info.com.ua/fop/792145-fop-gorban-vitalij-anatolijovich)\nAnatoliyovich.” His main activity is in food retail:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6 – Screenshot from the Directory of Companies of the Ukraine.**\n\nTherefore, we think “FOP HORBAN VITALII Anatoliyovich” is just a figurehead.\n\nAlmost the same situation appears if we search for data about another IP address used by\nthe Phorpiex C&C server – 185.176.27.132:\n\norg-name: IP Dunaev Yuriy Vyacheslavovich\n\norg-type: OTHER\n\naddress: 420132, Kazan, Chuikova str, 69\n\n[e-mail: [email protected]](https://research.checkpoint.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\nDunaev Yuriy Vyacheslavovich is also an individual entrepreneur from Russia (Republic\n[Tatarstan) whose main activity is transport services. As in the previous case, the activity of](https://info.1cont.ru/contragent/ip-dunaev-juriy-vjacheslavovich/)\nthe entrepreneur is not related to the Internet or IT in any way.\n\nPackets to this network are routed through Telehouse ISP, which is physically located in\nBulgaria:\n\n9 50 ms 49 ms 49 ms as50360.peer.telehouse.bg [178.132.83.102]\n\n10 46 ms 46 ms 46 ms 192.168.244.2\n\n11 51 ms 50 ms 50 ms 185.176.27.9\n\n12 50 ms 46 ms 50 ms 185.176.27.132\n\nPerhaps, what we are witnessing is cooperation between Phorpiex and another cybercrime\ngroup that obtains IP subnets from RIPE and provides services for hosting malicious C&C\ninfrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Crypto-jacking campaign\n\nCryptojacking is the unauthorized use of someone else’s computer to mine cryptocurrency.\nOne of the final payloads loaded to Phorpiex-controlled computers is XMRig mining software.\nThe reward for crypto-currency mining using XMRig is paid in Monero (XMR). The Phorpiex\nXMRRig miner comes with the configuration embedded in the sample. It uses Phorpiex C&C\nservers as mining pools:\n\n**XMRig downloaded from** **Pool address**\n\n\nhxxp://93.32.161[.]73/2\nhxxp://185.176.27[.]132/2\n\n\n193.32.161.73:7777\n\n\nhxxp://185.176.27[.]132/2 185.176.27.132:4545\n\nhxxp://193.32.161[.]77/2.exe 193.32.161.77:9595\n\n\nhxxp://92.63.197[.]38/3.exe\nhxxp://92.63.197[.]60/2.exe\nhxxp://92.63.197[.]153/2.exe\nhxxp://94.156.133[.]65/55.exe\n\n\n92.63.197.153:7575\n\n\nhxxp://193.32.161[.]69/2.exe\nhxxp://193.32.161[.]77/2.exe\n\n\n193.32.161.69:5555\n\n\n**Table 1 – Phorpiex C&C servers and XMRig mining pools.**\n\nIn addition, we found XMR addresses for Phorpiex XMRig samples and found that they are\n[the same as those used in the “sextortion” campaign. The wallets are stored in integrated](https://research.checkpoint.com/in-the-footsteps-of-a-sextortion-campaign/)\n[format. This means that the address also contains the Payment ID. The Payment ID is](https://web.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/paymentid.html)\nusually used to identify transactions to merchants and exchanges. Given the intrinsic privacy\nfeatures built into Monero, where a single public address is usually used for incoming\ntransactions, the Payment ID is especially useful to tie incoming payments with user\naccounts. The XMR addresses extracted from the Phorpiex XMRig samples and used in\nsextortion campaigns differ only by the Payment ID:\n\n\nWallet from the XMRig sample (MD5):\n**36e824615d72d11a3f962ec025bfceba**\n\n\n4BrL51JCc9NGQ71kWhnYoDRffsDZy7m1HUU7M\nU4nUMXAHNFBEJhkTZV9HdaL4gfuNBxLPc3BeM\nLGaPbF5vWtANQujt72bSgzs7j6uNDV\n\n\nWallet from the XMRig sample (MD5):\n**7f8880c0bc2dd024a3cf5261b6582313**\n\n\n4BrL51JCc9NGQ71kWhnYoDRffsDZy7m1HUU7M\nU4nUMXAHNFBEJhkTZV9HdaL4gfuNBxLPc3BeM\nLGaPbF5vWtANQsTC167gPTeRcVSaut\n\n\n-----\n\nWallet from the sextortion spam module\n(MD5):\n**2c50efc0fef1601ce1b96b1b7cf991fb**\n\n\n4BrL51JCc9NGQ71kWhnYoDRffsDZy7m1HUU7M\nU4nUMXAHNFBEJhkTZV9HdaL4gfuNBxLPc3BeM\nLGaPbF5vWtANQubDtNq5uuC622w4we\n\n\n**Table 2 – Phorpiex Monero wallets noticed in XMRig samples and sextortion campaign.**\n\nThese facts leave no doubt that the Phorpiex botnet owners receive all the profit from mining.\nUnfortunately for us, due to its privacy features, the Monero blockchain doesn’t allow us to\ntrack transactions and view an individual’s balance. However, we can estimate the\nprofitability of the crypto-jacking campaign using the results of the botnet capacity\nassessment, the [Monero mining profitability calculator, and other](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/xmr) [Monero benchmarks.](https://monerobenchmarks.info/)\nAssuming that the average Phorpiex victim doesn’t have top-level hardware, the basis of our\ncalculation was a low hash rate of 100 H/s which corresponds to INTEL I5-6500T CPU. At\nany given time, an average of 15,000 bots is online. Therefore, the total Monero mining hash\nrate provided by Phorpiex botnet is 1.5 MH/s. Of course, Phorpiex actors don’t pay for the\nelectricity and pool fee as regular miners do, so we assume those values are equal to 0:\n\n**Figure 7 – Monero mining profitability calculation.**\n\nTherefore, by our assessment, the Phorpiex botnet must generate at least 3,122 XMR per\nyear which currently is equivalent to about 21 Bitcoins (BTC) or $ 180,000.\n\n## Crypto-clipping campaign\n\n\n-----\n\nWe first saw transactions to the wallets observed in the Trik configuration in August 2016.\nThis may be the time when crypto-clipping functionality was first added to Trik. Malware\ncreators started their operations stealing Bitcoin only. In Tldr, they added support for a large\nnumber of virtual assets including Ethereum, Litecoin and even Perfectmoney.\nUnlike Monero, the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains allow us to monitor all transactions.\nTherefore, we are able to assess how effective a particular crypto-clipping campaign is. We\ncollected a large number of Trik and Tldr samples and the Bitcoin wallets extracted from\nthem.\nBitcoin wallets extracted from Trik configurations received a total of more than 11 BTC in 376\ntransactions:\n\n\nBTC Wallet Amount First\nTransaction\nDate\n\n\nLast\nTransaction\nDate\n\n\n1JWWZFUVAWvFNS2D5qwQQo4oSsseoD9kAn 0,04953613 14.08.2016 24.08.2016\n\n1HewcqbrkXY5iqrDqjb4j4AHiaDeobpE6P 0,00030088 21.06.2017 21.06.2017\n\n1KXZqR1fjAxcv1gvdmPfN2WsWsDwM7r2R2 0,0165661 18.06.2017 09.10.2018\n\n1of6uEzx5qfStF1HrVXaZ1eE3X4ntnbsx 5,33347017 10.08.2017 02.09.2019\n\n1LaVtKqJatoeAHkHEgp9UF2fJEarEdZPr9 0,37694525 13.09.2016 17.11.2016\n\n1Kzhh4nqyjB3MAoQ5uH2Bcdz3qXWpnsMzd 3,39173817 19.12.2016 10.04.2017\n\n1CpQYTKfiYj8ZoXUmz1DaohjJVsDzGpgbx 0,81380018 01.02.2017 11.09.2019\n\n18qKrmaUXaEgbYEn6yMkGKNcqkYB3mSxNv 1,60713638 22.11.2016 04.08.2018\n\nTotal 11,58949326\n\n**Table 3 – Phorpiex Trik crypto-clipper BTC wallets.**\n\nAs we can see from the table, despite the fact that Trik bots don’t receive updates and the\nC&C servers are offline, some wallets still continue to gain Bitcoins.\nThe table below contains Bitcoin wallets extracted from Tldr configurations:\n\n\nBTC Wallet Incoming\nTransactions\n\n\nAmount First\nTransactio\nDate\n\n\n1DYwJZfyGy5DXaqXpgzuj8shRefxQ7jCEw 214 2,53308 31.05.201\n\n1BdhCwNFzNbWoJvxrok6V7z2af7xjJLS58 23 0,313455 29.04.201\n\n\n-----\n\n1Gx8oRKKczwdB32yiLzVx5hsjAze6g5HHw 13 0,286929 05.07.201\n\n14GJm9M5zaX6Zyojt5yxNZcdoouJ4WPAgT 10 0,109102 31.01.201\n\n1EN3bbs8UdVWA3i3ixtB9jQWvPnP9us4va 50 0,277109 21.02.201\n\n1C2SvtsUu8YZVUBbha4KiBGYRW5dwtrRvd 9 0,141692 30.06.201\n\n18bzpjFfo5JQ41GzzUNRMgcE7WwQwpqFrR 14 0,116484 12.09.201\n\n1Bn4JYKoVgQpZ73doWVFSNZBbwKj3cpJNR 23 0,192937 28.07.201\n\n1CUhtfNjsGMZziCVzZ4oVan9NCGriY4NDZ 14 0,139406 17.04.201\n\n1MaN4Me35n1kM6h7JVPNUQYqYgjasEQLzs 29 0,105204 08.06.201\n\n19mduWVW9QphW5W2caWF84wcGVSmASRYpf 8 0,016345 27.09.201\n\n1L6sJ7pmk6EGMUoTmpdbLez9dXACcirRHh 25 0,242939 18.07.201\n\n13cQ2H6oszrEnvw1ZGdsPix9gUayB8tzNa 33 0,286732 19.08.201\n\n19B5G1ftgXRrD6GiTzThL9BiySVdf1HJZy 27 0,718224 04.12.201\n\n1LdFFaJiM7R5f9WhUEskVCaVokVtHPHxL5 7 0,017085 30.10.201\n\nTotal 499 5,49672513\n\n**Table 4 – Phorpiex Tldr crypto-clipper BTC wallets.**\n\nTherefore, in the 3 year period, crypto-clipping campaigns allowed the malware operators to\nsteal more than 17 BTC in 875 transactions, or about 5.6 BTC annually.\nEthereum crypto-currency wallets extracted from Trik and Tldr samples gained much less\nthan Bitcoin wallets:\n\n\nETH Wallet Incoming\nTransactions\n\n\nAmount\n\n\n0x8b7f16faa3f835a0d3e7871a1359e45914d8c344 2 0,163207\n\n0xa9b717e03cf8f2d792bff807588e50dcea9d0b1c 2 0,1988\n\n0xff0d45f3e2ec83de3b2e069300974732ba1c5d30 9 1,827462\n\n0x373b9854c9e4511b920372f5495640cdc25d6832 2 0,096352\n\n0x87f84b56fb061f51ca709f2ac3fc6e2d4b3b8f8f 5 4,139667\n\n0xa5228127395263575a4b4f532e4f132b14599d24 3 0,092458\n\n\n-----\n\n0x43e44151ad4d625d367376a6fd3ea44c82718777 3 7,294262\n\n0x05F916216CC4BA6ac89b8093d474E2a1e6121c63 2 0,301865\n\n0xc4e6e206ddc7f83a78582fc4e5536a8ed395c5e1 1 0,017308\n\n0x74e4195d16e8887ebe6d6abde1aa38bc91e69976 2 0,039646\n\n0x08a1f48df7b6847fe8276ee55068f6cf83340c9a 0 0\n\n0xb6d8926bf0418de68a7544c717bbb4ea198769cc 9 1,240524\n\n0xab1b250d67d08bf73ac864ea57af8cf762a29649 0 0\n\n0xff8c5843e7abe2708037fc1acdca83b37466a299 11 1,911012\n\nTotal 40 17,32256\n\n**Table 5 – Phorpiex crypto-clipper ETH wallets**\n\nThere are only 51 transactions, with a total amount of about 17 ETH, whose current value is\nmuch less than Bitcoin. However, those wallets are interesting to us for another reason.\n[Services like etherescan.io can show if an Ethereum address belongs to a particular](https://etherescan.io/)\nexchange or service. For the addresses from the table, all ETH are transferred to the\n[address of the Cryptonator service:](https://cryptonator.com/)\n\n**Figure 8 – Ethereum transactions from the Phorpiex ETH address.**\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the Ethereum addresses used in the crypto-clipping\ncampaign are created in a Cryptonator wallet. Cryptonator requires a valid email address for\nregistration and confirmation for each new IP address and device by email. We think that the\naccess logs of the Cryptonator service may store the real IP addresses of the Phorpiex\nactors.\n\nAnother interesting fact is that some of the Ethereum wallets have collected a large number\nof ERC-20 tokens:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 9 – Ethereum ERC-20 tokens transactions to the Phorpiex ETH address.**\n\nHowever, the tokens can’t be withdrawn from the wallets because Cryptonator doesn’t\nsupport tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. Most likely, this wasn’t taken into account\nby the malware actors. Therefore, token transfers from victims are simply blackholed.\n\nComparison to the sextortion campaign\n\n[We’ve been observing the Phorpiex sextortion campaign for about half a year. During this](https://research.checkpoint.com/in-the-footsteps-of-a-sextortion-campaign/)\nperiod, we recorded transfers of more than 14 Bitcoins [update the numbers before\npublication] to the Phorpiex wallets related to this campaign. If the trend continues, the\nannual revenue of the sextortion campaign would be 28 Bitcoins.\n\n**Figure 10 – Comparison of the Phorpiex earnings from different malicious activities**\n\n\n-----\n\nSextortion appears to be a more profitable venture than crypto-currency clipping or mining\nusing the botnet’s computing power. However, those malicious activities complement each\nother, generating about 54.6 Bitcoins annually, which is currently about $500,000.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe inspected some of Darknet advertisements that provide prices for malware installation\nservices. Usually infection services prices vary from $100 to $1000 per 1000 infections,\ndepending on the victims’ location. Phorpiex bots are mostly located in Asia – the region in\nwhich malware installation services are the cheapest. Therefore, to purchase malware\ninfection services on the Darknet, the owners of the Phropiex botnet would pay about\n$100,000. However, in addition to purchasing infections through side services like the RIG\nexploit kit or the Smokeloader botnet, Phropiex also uses its own distribution techniques: the\nVNC worm module, NetBIOS worm module, and file virus functionality. But even with these\ncosts, as we can see, the creation of such a botnet appears to be very profitable.\n\nThe tools used by Phorpiex are not too sophisticated. Obviously, not much time was spent\non their development. This case shows us that such a massive botnet can be created by\ncybercriminals without a deep knowledge of system programming, cryptography, etc.\n\nThe ecosystem that currently exists in the Darknet makes it easy enough to implement\nalmost any idea for cybercrime.\n\n## IOC\n\n**MD5** **Description** **Downloaded From**\n\n58198a2ebac604399c3e930207df47f1 Phorpiex Trik\nv5.0\n\n64990a45cf6b1b900c6b284bb54a1402 Phorpiex Tldr\nv3.0\n\ne5aea3b998644e394f506ac1f0f2f107 Phorpiex Tldr\nv2.0\n\n383498f810f0a992b964c19fc21ca398 Phorpiex Tldr\nv1.0\n\n\nafe348ff22ad43e98ee7ab19a851b817 Phorpiex Tldr\nmod2019\nDropped by Trik\n2019-07-23\n\nd9e59a4295926df49c8d6484aa6b8305 Phorpiex Tldr\nDropped by RIG\nEK 2019-05-29\n\n\nhxxp://92.63.197[.]59/lst.exe\n\n\nhxxp://94.156.133[.]65/11.exe\n\n\n-----\n\n051356bee1541f592d66969af46feb95 Phorpiex Tldr\nDropped by\nSmokeLoader\n2019-05-15\n\n99a349f6b758c80e9a1b88d1895e7790 Sextortion\nDASH\n\n\nhxxp://ghjk78kjhb[.]net/ ->\nhxxp://94.156.133[.]65/11.exe\n\n\nhxxp://185.176.27[.]132/4\n\n\nd85dcfd49b8e259f4135fa9f021f250a Sextortion BTC hxxp://thaus[.]top/7\n\n2c50efc0fef1601ce1b96b1b7cf991fb Sextortion XMR hxxp://185.176.27[.]132/6\n\n8f9b7c1c2b84b8c71318b6776d31c9af XMRig miner hxxp://185.176.27[.]132/2\n\n**C&C IP** **MD5**\n\n112.126.94.107 2d33fd32d8ec7b7d0ed379b80a167ff4\n\n123.56.228.49 2d33fd32d8ec7b7d0ed379b80a167ff4\n\n172.104.40.92 2d33fd32d8ec7b7d0ed379b80a167ff4\n\n185.176.27.132 f3dcf80b6251cfba1cd754006f693a73\n\n193.32.161.69 a8ab5aca96d260e649026e7fc05837bf\n\n193.32.161.73 a24bb61df75034769ffdda61c7a25926\n\n193.32.161.77 cc89100f20002801fa401b77dab0c512\n\n87.120.37.156 97835760aa696d8ab7acbb5a78a5b013\n\n87.120.37.234 a0039fbc46f2e874f2e4151712993343\n\n87.120.37.235 f0c7f0823de1a9303aa26d058c9951a0\n\n92.63.197.106 e24b40197da64a4baa9a81cc735e839b\n\n92.63.197.112 82eecd3b80caa7d0f51aba4ee8149c1a\n\n92.63.197.153 20ef08bdae07f3494e20195e65d7b7f5\n\n92.63.197.38 49d218a1a09ba212e187dc2de923ba62\n\n92.63.197.48 1462114257a6fcc52a8782c2a2616009\n\n92.63.197.59 c63a7c559870873133a84f0eb6ca54cd\n\n92.63.197.60 82eecd3b80caa7d0f51aba4ee8149c1a\n\n94.156.133.65 b69270ee30bd20694948dba6c09ead7f\n\n\n-----\n\n95.81.1.43 5c79b524fb8d9bb4e9a3d79fe543c011\n\n124.158.10.82 1727de1b3d5636f1817d68ba0208fb50\n\n125.212.217.33 1727de1b3d5636f1817d68ba0208fb50\n\n125.212.217.30 1727de1b3d5636f1817d68ba0208fb50\n\n127.181.87.80 af1cf2281597aba08e40cf7c030d71a9\n\n183.81.171.242 53cb3f1e57fbd596463d164d1ca79a14\n\n185.189.58.222 aa0d8b2506376c95ba314e14f08a9b49\n\n220.181.87.80 f8c110929606dca4c08ecaa9f9baf140\n\n210.211.116.246 1727de1b3d5636f1817d68ba0208fb50\n\n_Check Point Anti-Bot blade provides protection against this threat:_\n_Worm.Win32.Phorpiex.C_\n_Worm.Win32.Phorpiex.D_\n_Worm.Win32.Phorpiex.H_\n\n\n-----",
