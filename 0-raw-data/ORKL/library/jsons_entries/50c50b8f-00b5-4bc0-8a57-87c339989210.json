Even so, most major Web site owners aren’t taking full advantage of the security tools\navailable to protect their domains from being hijacked. Here’s the story of one recent victim\nwho was doing almost everything possible to avoid such a situation and still had a key\ndomain stolen by scammers.\n\nThe U.S. government — along with a number of leading security companies — recently\nwarned about a series of highly complex and widespread attacks that allowed suspected\nIranian hackers to siphon huge volumes of email passwords and other sensitive data from\nmultiple governments and private companies. But to date, the specifics of exactly how that\nattack went down and who was hit have remained shrouded in secrecy.\n\nThis post seeks to document the extent of those attacks, and traces the origins of this\noverwhelmingly successful cyber espionage campaign back to a cascading series of\nbreaches at key Internet infrastructure providers.\n\nMailing List\n\n[Subscribe here](https://krebsonsecurity.com/subscribe/)\nSearch KrebsOnSecurity\n\nRecent Posts\n\nSpam Nation\n\n\n-----\n\nA New York Times Bestseller!\n\nThinking of a Cybersecurity Career?\n\nRead this\n\n\n-----\n\nAll About Skimmers\n\nClick image for my skimmer series.\n\nStory Categories\n\n[A Little Sunshine](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/sunshine/)\n[All About Skimmers](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/all-about-skimmers/)\n[Ashley Madison breach](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/ashley-madison-breach/)\n[Breadcrumbs](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/breadcrumbs/)\n[Data Breaches](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/data-breaches/)\n[DDoS-for-Hire](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/ddos-for-hire/)\n[Employment Fraud](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/employment-fraud/)\n[How to Break Into Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/how-to-break-into-security/)\n[Latest Warnings](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/latest-warnings/)\n[Ne'er-Do-Well News](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/neer-do-well-news/)\n[Other](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/other/)\n[Pharma Wars](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/pharma-wars/)\n[Ransomware](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/ransomware/)\n[Russia's War on Ukraine](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/russias-war-on-ukraine/)\n[Security Tools](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/security-tools/)\n[SIM Swapping](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/sim-swapping/)\n[Spam Nation](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/spam-nation/)\n[Target: Small Businesses](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/smallbizvictims/)\n[Tax Refund Fraud](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/tax-refund-fraud/)\n[The Coming Storm](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/comingstorm/)\n[Time to Patch](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/patches/)\n[Web Fraud 2.0](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/web-fraud-2-0/)\n\nThe Value of a Hacked PC\n\n\n-----\n\nBadguy uses for your PC\n\nBadguy Uses for Your Email\n\nYour email account may be worth far more than you imagine.\n\nWhy So Many Top Hackers Hail from Russia\n\n\n-----\n\nCategory: Web Fraud 2.0\n\nInnovations from the Underground\n\n\n-----\n\nID Protection Services Examined\n\nIs Antivirus Dead?\n\nThe reasons for its decline\n\nThe Growing Tax Fraud Menace\n\nFile 'em Before the Bad Guys Can\n\nInside a Carding Shop\n\n\n-----\n\nA crash course in carding.\n\nBeware Social Security Fraud\n\nSign up, or Be Signed Up!\n\nHow Was Your Card Stolen?\n\n\n-----\n\nFinding out is not so easy.\n\nKrebs’s 3 Rules…\n\n...For Online Safety.\n\n\n-----",
