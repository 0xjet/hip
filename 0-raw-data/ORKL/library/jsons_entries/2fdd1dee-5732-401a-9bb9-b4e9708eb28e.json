Working with U.S\npartners, DHS and FBI identified a malware variant used by the North Korean government. This malware has been identified as ELECTRICFISH.\nGovernment refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA ac\nhttps://www.us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.\n\nDHS and FBI are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity.\n\nThis MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques. Use\nadministrators should flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CIS\nCyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.\n\nThis report provides analysis of one malicious 32-bit Windows executable file. The malware implements a custom protocol that allows traffic to be\nbetween a source and a destination Internet Protocol (IP) address. The malware continuously attempts to reach out to the source and the designa\nwhich allows either side to initiate a tunneling session. The malware can be configured with a proxy server/port and proxy username and passwor\nallows connectivity to a system sitting inside of a proxy server, which allows the actor to bypass the compromised system’s required authentication\noutside of the network.\nFor a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:\n\n[MAR-10135536-21.stix](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10135536-21.stix.xml)\n\nSubmitted Files (1)\n\na1260fd3e9221d1bc5b9ece6e7a5a98669c79e124453f2ac58625085759ed3bb (a1260fd3e9221d1bc5b9ece6e7a5a9...)\n\n## Findings\n\n**a1260fd3e9221d1bc5b9ece6e7a5a98669c79e124453f2ac58625085759ed3bb**\n\nDetails\n\n**Name** a1260fd3e9221d1bc5b9ece6e7a5a98669c79e124453f2ac58625085759ed3bb\n\n**Size** 1422336 bytes\n\n**Type** PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n**MD5** 8d9123cd2648020292b5c35edc9ae22e\n\n**SHA1** 0939363ff55d914e92635e5f693099fb28047602\n\n**SHA256** a1260fd3e9221d1bc5b9ece6e7a5a98669c79e124453f2ac58625085759ed3bb\n\n**SHA512** 646697e3d5146e05a221183f6c9f00f5eb38400ef9a2f83bfd0fcf2f8af1a7efff99c0a3486740c745ce6cf0939c4f0678cb818cbbff8ed2b28a\n\n**ssdeep** 24576:HsO8RKL6OLnWZGFbHq0aMow5Q3gkD/74tU3hYPgP5IyrMsEOhVRpxHkADUHEPbzJ:0KjKHMbO3pkoBIyIstVRpxHL1bF\n\n**Entropy** 6.703195\n\nAntivirus\n\n**BitDefender** Gen:Variant.Ursu.349885Unclassified\n\n**Emsisoft** Gen:Variant.Ursu.349885 (B)\n\nYara Rules\n\nNo matches found.\n\nssdeep Matches\n\nNo matches found.\n\nPE Metadata\n\n\n-----\n\n**Compile Date** 2018-09-29 11:55:36-04:00\n\n**Import Hash** 3549cfa19e60aa9239f79d80e19279fa\n\nPE Sections\n\n**MD5** **Name** **Raw Size** **Entropy**\n\n08bb17d8e839e7fc92426e813a696e73 header 1024 2.590786\n\n6c3daca3c522ab98a8ac12a45087297c .text 983040 6.595856\n\n3d3d7962d16652002018640a3fa27d44 .rdata 340480 6.187858\n\nb7f382ea7e6c9c8e737cb92551341e64 .data 37888 4.714377\n\n871fb8486e5ea3307ff7b65ddf46518a .rsrc 512 5.112624\n\n382715f8e776a544bf70f843a52e3ff2 .reloc 59392 6.015022\n\nPackers/Compilers/Cryptors\n\nMicrosoft Visual C++ ?.?\n\nProcess List\n\n**Process** **PID** **PPID**\n\nlsass.exe 488 (384)\n\na1260fd3e9221d1bc5b9ece6e7a5a98669c79e124453f2ac58625085759ed3bb.exe 3052 (3024)\n\nDescription\n\nThis file is a malicious Windows 32-bit executable.

If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.\nRestrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unl\nEnforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.\nExercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.\nEnable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.\nDisable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\nScan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file\nMonitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.\nExercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).\nScan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.\nMaintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).\n\nAdditional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Specia\n800-83, \"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops\".\n\n## Contact Information\n\nCISA continuously strives to improve its products and services.
