For example, below is one of the samples collected by\nDuncan that has its bytes reversed in the original download.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DLL saved in reverse byte order** _(isc.sans.edu)_\nEventually, the final payload is assembled on the machine under the name\n\"qwveqwveqw.exe,\" which is likely random, and a new registry key is added for persistence.\n\n\n-----\n\n**New registry key and the malicious executable** _(isc.sans.edu)_\nA clear and persistent sign of the infection is the EXE file generating traffic to a command\nand control server at 193.106.191[.]162, even after the system reboots, restarting the\ninfection process on the compromised machine.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Malicious traffic captured in Wireshark** _(isc.sans.edu)_\nOne thing to note is that META modifies Windows Defender via PowerShell to exclude .exe\nfiles from scanning, to protect its files from detection.\n\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into the malicious traffic details for detection purposes or curiosity,\nDuncan has published the PCAP of the infection traffic [here.](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2022/04/06/index.html)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[German automakers targeted in year-long malware campaign](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/german-automakers-targeted-in-year-long-malware-campaign/)\n\n[Ukraine warns of “chemical attack” phishing pushing stealer malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-warns-of-chemical-attack-phishing-pushing-stealer-malware/)\n\n[Pixiv, DeviantArt artists hit by NFT job offers pushing malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pixiv-deviantart-artists-hit-by-nft-job-offers-pushing-malware/)\n\n[New powerful Prynt Stealer malware sells for just $100 per month](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-powerful-prynt-stealer-malware-sells-for-just-100-per-month/)\n\n[PDF smuggles Microsoft Word doc to drop Snake Keylogger malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pdf-smuggles-microsoft-word-doc-to-drop-snake-keylogger-malware/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience\nworking on various online publications.
