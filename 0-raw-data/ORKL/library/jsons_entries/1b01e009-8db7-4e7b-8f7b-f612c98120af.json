And in the end, a rare\naction happened: Someone was actually arrested.\n\nThis episode of \"The Ransomware Files\" talks to those who had a role in this incredible\n[event. It also coincides with the release of new technical information about the software](https://csirt.divd.nl/2022/04/04/Kaseya-VSA-Full-Disclosure/)\nvulnerabilities exploited by the ransomware gang, which were found by the Dutch Institute for\nVulnerability Disclosure, or DIVD.\n\n\n-----\n\nREvil managed to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in the Virtual Systems Administrator, which\nis remote management software made by Kaseya and widely used by managed service\nproviders. The vulnerabilities allowed the group to spread its ransomware, which was\ndisguised as a software update.\n\nDIVD had warned Kaseya of the vulnerabilities in April, but REvil also discovered them, says\nFrank Breedijk, manager of DIVD's Computer Security Incident Response Team. Breedijk\nand DIVD's chairman, Victor Gevers, felt they had lost the race with the attackers.\n\n\"We were in this marathon to fix software that had quite a bit of technical debt in it,\" Breedijk\nsays. \"And then with the finish line in sight, on your right-hand side, all of a sudden comes\nUsain Bolt, passes you, flips you the bird and ransoms a whole bunch of systems.\"\n\nThe attack resulted in more than 1,500 organizations becoming infected with ransomware.\nRobert Cioffi is the founder of Progressive Computing, which is a New York-based managed\nservice provider that used Kaseya's VSA to deliver services to its clients.\n\nCioffi feared he might lose his business after speaking with a colleague on the day of the\nattack in July 2021. All 80 of his customers were infected.\n\n\"I couldn't comprehend the words coming out of his mouth - that all of our customers were\nransomwared,\" Cioffi says. \"It just didn't make sense to me. What? How is it that everyone is\nransomwared?\"\n\nThere are other twists and turns. The FBI and its law enforcement partners hacked back at\nthe hackers, snatching a universal decryption key. And after the REvil gang went dark for\ngood, prosecutors announced the arrest of a Ukrainian man, Yaroslav Vasinskyi, for the\nattack against Kaseya. Vasinskyi is now awaiting trial in Texas (see: US Nabs Alleged\n_Ransomware Operators - One Tied to Kaseya)._\n\n[\"The Ransomware Files\" is a podcast miniseries available on Spotify,](https://open.spotify.com/show/14nO7YaLCzbCtymJ7GWRNq) [Apple Podcasts,](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/the-ransomware-files/id1593282775)\n[Google,](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy83MjU1YzE2Yy9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw) [Audible,](https://www.audible.com.au/pd/Podcast/B08K6R7N1N?qid=1636075188&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=771c6463-05d7-4981-9b47-920dc34a70f1&pf_rd_r=KEQZ39401YAE84S7VEQ8) [Stitcher and more.
