The exact same certificate had been used to sign non-malicious D-Link\n\n software; therefore, the certificate was likely stolen.\n\n Having confirmed the file’s malicious nature, we notified D-Link, who launched their own\n\n investigation into the matter. As a result, the compromised digital certificate was revoked by D\n Link on July 3, 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. The D-Link Corporation code signing certificate used to sign malware\n\n\n## The malware\n\n\n-----\n\n#### component. Recently, the JPCERT published a thorough analysis of the Plead backdoor, which,\n\n according to Trend Micro, is used by the cyberespionage group BlackTech.\n\n\nFigure 2 The Changing Information Technology Inc code signing certificate used to sign malware\n\n\n-----\n\n#### identified samples signed using a certificate belonging to a Taiwanese security company named\n\n Changing Information Technology Inc.\n\n Despite the fact that the Changing Information Technology Inc. certificate was revoked on July\n\n ​4, ​2017, the BlackTech group is still using it to sign their malicious tools.\n\n The ability to compromise several Taiwan-based technology companies and reuse their code\n signing certificates in future attacks shows that this group is highly skilled and focused on that\n\n region.\n\n The signed Plead malware samples are highly obfuscated with junk code, but the purpose of\n\n the malware is similar in all samples: it downloads from a remote server or opens from the local\n\n disk a small encrypted binary blob. This binary blob contains encrypted shellcode, which\n\n downloads the final Plead backdoor module.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Obfuscated code of the Plead malware\n\n\n#### The password stealer tool is used to collect saved passwords from the following applications:\n\nGoogle Chrome\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft Outlook\n\nMozilla Firefox\n\n## Why steal digital certificates?\n\n#### Misusing digital certificates is one of the many ways cybercriminals try to mask their malicious\n\n intentions – as the stolen certificates let malware appear like legitimate applications, the\n\n malware has a greater chance of sneaking past security measures without raising suspicion.\n\n Probably the most infamous malware known to have used several stolen digital certificates is\n\n the Stuxnet worm, discovered in 2010 and the malware behind the very first cyberattack to\n\n target critical infrastructure. Stuxnet used digital certificates stolen from RealTek and one from\n\n JMicron, two well-known technology companies based in Taiwan.\n\n However, the tactic is not exclusive to high-profile incidents like Stuxnet, as evidenced by this\n\n recent discovery.\n\n\n-----\n\nESET detection names\n\nWin32/PSW.Agent.OES trojan\n\nWin32/Plead.L trojan\n\nWin32/Plead.S trojan\n\nWin32/Plead.T trojan\n\nWin32/Plead.U trojan\n\nWin32/Plead.V trojan\n\nWin32/Plead.X trojan\n\nWin32/Plead.Y trojan\n\nWin32/Plead.Z trojan\n\n\n-----\n\n80AE7B26AC04C93AD693A2D816E8742B906CC0E3\n\n62A693F5E4F92CCB5A2821239EFBE5BD792A46CD\n\nB01D8501F1EEAF423AA1C14FCC816FAB81AC8ED8\n\n11A5D1A965A3E1391E840B11705FFC02759618F8\n\n239786038B9619F9C22401B110CF0AF433E0CEAD\n\nSigned samples (SHA-1)\n\n1DB4650A89BC7C810953160C6E41A36547E8CF0B\n\nCA160884AE90CFE6BEC5722FAC5B908BF77D9EEF\n\n9C4F8358462FAFD83DF51459DBE4CD8E5E7F2039\n\n13D064741B801E421E3B53BC5DABFA7031C98DD9\n\n\n-----\n\namazon.panasocin[.]com\n\noffice.panasocin[.]com\n\nokinawas.ssl443[.]org\n\n\nCode signing certificates serial numbers\n\n\nD-Link Corporation: 13:03:03:e4:57:0c:27:29:09:e2:65:dd:b8:59:de:ef\n\nChanging Information Technology Inc: 73:65:ed:e7:f8:fb:b1:47:67:02:d2:93:08:39:6f:51\n\n1e:50:cc:3d:d3:9b:4a:cc:5e:83:98:cc:d0:dd:53:ea\n\n\n\n[Anton Cherepanov](https://www.welivesecurity.com/author/acherepanov/) 9 Jul 2018 - 12:28PM\n\n\n-----\n\n[FIFA WORLD CUP](https://www.welivesecurity.com/category/fifa-world-cup/) [MALWARE](https://www.welivesecurity.com/category/malware/) [MALWARE](https://www.welivesecurity.com/category/malware/) [MALWARE](https://www.welivesecurity.com/category/malware/)\n\n\n[MALWARE](https://www.welivesecurity.com/category/malware/)\n\n\n[FIFA WORLD CUP](https://www.welivesecurity.com/category/fifa-world-cup/)\n\n\nAmmyy Admin\ncompromised with\nmalware again; World\nCup used as cover\n\n\n[MALWARE](https://www.welivesecurity.com/category/malware/)\n\n\nNew Telegram-abusing\n[Android RAT discovered](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/06/18/new-telegram-abusing-android-rat/)\nin the wild\n\n\n[MALWARE](https://www.welivesecurity.com/category/malware/)\n\n\nBackSwap malware finds\n[innovative ways to](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/05/25/backswap-malware-empty-bank-accounts/)\nempty bank accounts\n\n\nOne year later:\nEternalBlue exploit more\npopular now than during\nWannaCryptor outbreak\n\n\n### Discussion\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nAbout Us\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Experts\n\nESET\n\n\nHow To\n\nCategories\n\n\nNews Widget\n\n\n-----",
