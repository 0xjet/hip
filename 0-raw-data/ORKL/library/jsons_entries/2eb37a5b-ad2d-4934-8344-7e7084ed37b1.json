These tools can be\nused to hook into system drivers and access local passwords and the LDAP server.\nReported capabilities include monitoring keystrokes and mouse movements,\naccessing webcams and USB drives, searching and replacing local files and\nmaintaining a persistent connection.\n\nThe signatures and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) included in this advisory will\nassist in detecting APT28 malware. Network based signatures alone will not guarantee\nsuccessful identification of APT28 in a network. Many of the communication modules\nused by the actor are wrapped in protocols such as SSL/TLS, with the intention of\nevading content-based signatures.\n\nPlease use the indicators in this NCSC advisory to check for the presence of this\nmalware on your platforms and networks.\n\n## Detecting known ATP28 tools\n\n### X-AGENT\n\nX-AGENT (Also known as CHOPSTICK) is a second-stage modular remote access\ntrojan (RAT). It can run on Windows, iOS and Unix-based operating systems.\n\nFunctions of X-AGENT include key logging and file extraction. It is often used after\nfirst stage malware such as CORESHELL or GAMEFISH. X-AGENT is likely to be\nused in conjunction with XTUNNEL and CompuTrace/Lojack. Recent versions of XAGENT use SSL/TLS to encrypt the communications.\n\n### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\nThe following IP addresses and domains have been used for X-AGENT Command\nand Control (C2) servers, to communicate with victims:\n\n**IP Address** **Domain**\n139.5.177.205 malaytravelgroup.com\n80.255.6.15 worldimagebucket.com\n89.34.111.107 fundseats.com\n86.106.131.229    globaltechengineers.org\n139.5.177.206\n185.181.102.203 beststreammusic.com\n185.181.102.204 thepiratecinemaclub.org\n169.239.129.31 coindmarket.com\n\n2 of 8\n\n|IP Address|Domain|\n|---|---|\n|139.5.177.205|malaytravelgroup.com|\n|80.255.6.15|worldimagebucket.com|\n|89.34.111.107|fundseats.com|\n|86.106.131.229|globaltechengineers.org|\n|139.5.177.206||\n|185.181.102.203|beststreammusic.com|\n|185.181.102.204|thepiratecinemaclub.org|\n|169.239.129.31|coindmarket.com|\n\n\n-----\n\n|213.252.247.112|creekcounty.net|\n|---|---|\n|185.86.148.15||\n|89.45.67.110|virtsvc.com|\n|185.86.150.205||\n|193.37.255.10|moderntips.org|\n|195.12.50.171|daysheduler.org|\n|51.38.128.110|escochart.com|\n|185.144.83.124|loungecinemaclub.com|\n|185.216.35.10|genericnetworkaddress.com|\n|185.94.192.122|bulgariatripholidays.com|\n|185.216.35.7|georgia-travel.org|\n|103.253.41.124|bbcweather.org|\n|185.189.112.195|politicweekend.com|\n|185.230.124.246|truefashionnews.com|\n|87.120.254.106|protonhardstorage.com|\n|77.81.98.122|moldtravelgroup.com|\n|89.34.111.132|iboxmit.com|\n|46.21.147.55|brownvelocity.org|\n|103.208.86.57|pointtk.com|\n|185.128.24.104|narrowpass.net|\n|145.239.67.8|powernoderesources.com|\n|185.210.219.250||\n|86.105.9.174|topcinemaclub.com|\n|89.34.111.107|fundseats.com|\n\n\n### Snort Rules\n\nThe following snort rules can be used to detect X-Agent communications between\nCommand and Control (C2) servers and victims:\n```\nalert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (flow:\nestablished,from_client; msg: \"XAgent Beacon\"; content:\n\"HTTP/1.1|0d 0a|Accept|3a|\ntext/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml|3b|q=0.9,*\";\n!\"Host|3a| yandex.ru\";; pcre: \"/^(?:GET|POST)\n\\/(?:watch|search|find|results|open|search|close)\\/\\?(?:text=|from\n=|aq=|ai=|ags=|oe=|btnG=|oprnd=|utm=|channel=|itwm=)/\";)\nalert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (flow:\nestablished,from_client; msg:: \"XAgent itwm beacon v1\"; content:\n\"/?itwm\"; fast_pattern; pcre: \"/itwm=[A-Za-z0-9\\-\\_]{29,35}/\";)\nalert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (flow:\nestablished,from_client; msg:: \"XAgent itwm beacon v2\"; content:\n\"&itwm\"; fast_pattern; pcre: \"/&itwm=[A-Za-z0-9\\-\\_]{29,35}/\";)\n\n### Hashes\n\n```\nThe following are SHA-1 hashes of X-Agent files used by APT28:\n\n3 of 8\n\n\n-----\n\n**Filename** **Hash**\nchost.exe 46e2957e699fae6de1a212dd98ba4e2bb969497d\nmsoutlook.dll c53930772beb2779d932655d6c3de5548810af3d\nSamp_(16).file fa695e88c87843ca0ba9fc04b176899ff90e9ac5\noutlook.dll 046a8adc2ef0f68107e96babc59f41b6f0a57803\n\n### CompuTrace\n\nCompuTrace/Lojack is a legitimate piece of software, which can track and assist in the\nrecovery of lost or stolen laptops as well as remotely locking and deleting files.\n\nAPT28 have modified this software.

The\ncommunications module used by ZEBROCY transmits using HTTP. The implant has\nkey logging and file exfiltration functionality and utilises a file collection capability that\nidentifies files with particular extensions.\n\nThe primary deployment mechanism for ZEBROCY has been spear-phishing emails,\nin which the payload runs systeminfo, tasklist and also takes a screenshot.\n\n### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n\nThe following IP addresses have been used for ZEBROCY victim communications:\n\n\n**IP Address**\n176.223.111.243\n172.104.21.26\n188.241.68.118\n89.45.67.153\n185.25.50.93\n45.124.132.127\n\n### Snort Rules\n\nThe following snort rule can be used to detect a string present in ZEBROCY victim\ncommunications:\n```\nalert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (flow:\nestablished,from_client; msg: \"APT28 - Web/request -FILE- contenttype\"; content: \"-FILE-\"; pcre: \"/[A-Z0-9\\-]{16}-FILE[^\\r\\n]+.tmp/\"\n\n### Hashes\n\n```\nThe following are SHA-1 hashes of ZEBROCY files:\n\n**Filename** **Hash**\ncodexgigas_913ac13ff24 913ac13ff245baeff843a99dc2cbc1ff5f8c025c\n5baeff843a99dc2cbc1ff5f\n8c025c\n\ncodexgigas_b758c7775d b758c7775d9bcdc0473fc2e738b32f05b464b175\n9bcdc0473fc2e738b32f0\n5b464b175\n\n6 of 8\n\n|Filename|Hash|\n|---|---|\n|codexgigas_913ac13ff24 5baeff843a99dc2cbc1ff5f 8c025c|913ac13ff245baeff843a99dc2cbc1ff5f8c025c|\n|codexgigas_b758c7775d 9bcdc0473fc2e738b32f0 5b464b175|b758c7775d9bcdc0473fc2e738b32f05b464b175|\n\n\n-----\n\n|UpnP Error Handler|3e7dfe9a8d5955a825cb51cb6eec0cd07c569b41|\n|---|---|\n\n\n### Mitigation\n\nFollow the high-level security mitigations detailed in the NCSC mitigating malware\n**guidance** [(https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malware) and in the Preventing](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malware)\n**Lateral Movement guidance** [(https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/preventing-lateral-](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/preventing-lateral-movement)\n[movement).](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/preventing-lateral-movement)\n\nFor additional mitigations for Windows 10 follow the NCSC Windows 10 EUD\n**guidance:** [https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/eud-security-guidance-windows-10-1703.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/eud-security-guidance-windows-10-1703)\nThis guidance details how to configure AppLocker to help prevent malicious applications\nfrom running on end user devices.\n\n**Deploy SysMon. Microsoft SysInternals Tool SysMon, is able to monitor and log system**\nactivity to the Windows Event Log. It can provide information about process creations,\nnetwork connections, and changes to file creation time.\n\nBy collecting the events it generates using Windows Event Collection or SIEM agents,\nand subsequently analysing them, Network Defenders and System Administrators can\nidentify malicious or anomalous activity and understand how intruders and malware\noperate on their networks.\n\nTo help reduce the risk of PowerShell being used as an attack vector on the\nnetwork, these two pieces of guidance will help:\n\n  - [https://www.iad.gov/iad/library/ia-guidance/security-tips/powershell-security-risks-](https://www.iad.gov/iad/library/ia-guidance/security-tips/powershell-security-risks-and-defenses.cfm)\n\n[and-defenses.cfm](https://www.iad.gov/iad/library/ia-guidance/security-tips/powershell-security-risks-and-defenses.cfm)\n\n  - [https://www.asd.gov.au/publications/protect/securing-powershell.htm](https://www.asd.gov.au/publications/protect/securing-powershell.htm)\n\n**Manage macros carefully:**\n\n  - Disable Office macros except in the specific apps where they are required\n\n  - Only enable macros for users that need them day-to-day\n\n  - Ensure these users understand how harmful macros can be, and treat macros\n\nfrom untrusted sources with extreme caution\n\n  - Use a recent and fully patched version of Office.\n\n  - The underlying platform should, ideally, be configured in line with the NCSC’s\n\nEUD Security Guidance. See NCSC Guidance:\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/end-user-device-security and\n[https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/macro-security-microsoft-office](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/macro-security-microsoft-office)\n\n**Layer phishing defences. Detect and quarantine as many malicious email attachments**\nand as much spam as possible, before they reach your end users. Multiple layers of\ndefence will greatly cut the chances of a compromise.\n\n  - **Treat people as your first line of defence. Tell staff how to report suspected**\n\nphishing emails, and ensure they feel confident to do so. Investigate their reports\n\n\n7 of 8\n\n\n-----\n\npromptly and thoroughly. Never punish users for clicking phishing links or opening\nattachments.\n[See NCSC Guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/phishing](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/phishing)\n\n**Consider implementing a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**\nsolution to centrally collate logs from SysMon and Windows Event Logs.\n\n**Set up a security monitoring capability so you are collecting the data that will be**\nneeded to analyse network intrusions.
