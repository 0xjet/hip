This is a golden\nopportunity for threat actors to capitalize on fear, spread misinformation, and generate mass\nhysteria—all while compromising victims with scams or malware campaigns.\n\n[Profiting from global health concerns, natural disasters, and other extreme weather events is](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/social-engineering/2019/10/help-prevent-disaster-donation-scams-from-causing-more-misery/)\n[nothing new for cybercriminals. Scams related to SARS, H1N1 (swine flu), and avian flu have](https://www.nclnet.org/beware_of_h1n1_scams)\n[circulated online for more than a decade. According to reports from ZDnet, many state-sponsored](https://www.zdnet.com/article/state-sponsored-hackers-are-now-using-coronavirus-lures-to-infect-their-targets/)\nthreat actors have already started to distribute coronavirus lures, including:\n\nChinese APTs: Vicious Panda, Mustang Panda\nNorth Korean APTs: Kimsuky\n[Russian APTs: Hades group (believed to have ties with APT28), TA542 (Emotet)](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/botnets/2019/09/emotet-is-back-botnet-springs-back-to-life-with-new-spam-campaign/)\nOther APTs: Sweed (Lokibot)\n\n[Recently, the Red Drip team reported that APT36 was using a decoy health advisory document to](https://twitter.com/RedDrip7/status/1237983760802394112?s=20)\nspread a Remote Administration Tool (RAT).\n\nAPT36 is believed to be a Pakistani state-sponsored threat actor mainly targeting the defense,\nembassies, and the government of India. APT36 performs cyber-espionage operations with the\nintent of collecting sensitive information from India that supports Pakistani military and diplomatic\n[interests. This group, active since 2016, is also known as Transparent Tribe, ProjectM, Mythic](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/proofpoint-operation-transparent-tribe-threat-insight-en.pdf)\nLeopard, and TEMP.Lapis.\n\n## APT36 spreads fake coronavirus health advisory\n\n\n-----\n\n[APT36 mainly relies on both spear phishing and watering hole attacks to gain its foothold on](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/social-engineering/2020/01/spear-phishing-101-what-you-need-to-know/)\nvictims. The phishing email is either a malicious macro document or an rtf file exploiting\nvulnerabilities, such as CVE-2017-0199.\n\nIn the coronavirus-themed attack, APT36 used a spear phishing email with a link to a malicious\ndocument (Figure 1) masquerading as the government of India (email.gov.in.maildrive[.]email/?\n_att=1579160420)._\n\nFigure 1: Phishing document containing malicious macro code\n\nWe looked at the previous phishing campaigns related to this APT and can confirm this is a new\nphishing pattern from this group. The names used for directories and functions are likely Urdu\nnames.\n\nThe malicious document has two hidden macros that drop a RAT variant called Crimson RAT. The\nmalicious macro (Figure 2) first creates two directories with the names “Edlacar” and “Uahaiws”\nand then checks the OS type.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: malicious macro\n\nBased on the OS type, the macro picks either a 32bit or 64bit version of its RAT payload in zip\nformat that is stored in one of the two textboxes in UserForm1 (Figure 3).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: embedded payloads in ZIP format\n\nThen it drops the zip payload into the Uahaiws directory and unzips its content using the\n“UnAldizip” function, dropping the RAT payload into the Edlacar directory. Finally, it calls the Shell\nfunction to execute the payload.\n\n## Crimson RAT\n\nThe Crimson RAT has been written in .Net (Figure 4) and its capabilities include:\n\nStealing credentials from the victim’s browser\nListing running processes, drives, and directories on the victim’s machine\nRetrieving files from its C&C server\nUsing custom TCP protocol for its C&C communications\nCollecting information about antivirus software\nCapturing screenshots\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Crimson RAT\n\nUpon running the payload, Crimson RAT connects to its hardcoded C&C IP addresses and sends\ncollected information about the victim back to the server, including a list of running processes and\ntheir IDs, the machine hostname, and its username (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: TCP communications\n\n## Ongoing use of RATs\n\nAPT36 has used many different malware families in the past, but has mostly deployed RATs, such\nas BreachRAT, DarkComet, Luminosity RAT, and njRAT.\n\nIn past campaigns, they were able to compromise Indian military and government databases to\nsteal sensitive data, including army strategy and training documents, tactical documents, and\nother official letters. They also were able to steal personal data, such as passport scans and\npersonal identification documents, text messages, and contact details.\n\n## Protection against RATs\n\nWhile most general users needn’t worry about nation-state attacks, organizations wanting to\n[protect against this threat should consider using an endpoint protection system or endpoint](https://www.malwarebytes.com/business/endpointprotection/)\ndetection and response with exploit blocking and real-time malware detection.\n\n\n-----\n\nShoring up vulnerabilities by keeping all software (including Microsoft Excel and Word) up-to-date\nshields against exploit attacks. In addition, training employees and users to avoid opening\ncoronavirus resources from unvetted sources can protect against this and other social\nengineering attacks from threat actors.\n\nMalwarebytes users are protected against this attack. We block the malicious macro execution as\nwell as its payload with our application behavior protection layer and real-time malware detection.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nDecoy URLs\n```\nemail.gov.in.maildrive[.]email/?att=1579160420\nemail.gov.in.maildrive[.]email/?att=1581914657\n\n```\nDecoy documents\n```\n876939aa0aa157aa2581b74ddfc4cf03893cede542ade22a2d9ac70e2fef1656\n20da161f0174d2867d2a296d4e2a8ebd2f0c513165de6f2a6f455abcecf78f2a\n\n```\nCrimson RAT\n```\n0ee399769a6e6e6d444a819ff0ca564ae584760baba93eff766926b1effe0010\nb67d764c981a298fa2bb14ca7faffc68ec30ad34380ad8a92911b2350104e748\n\n```\nC2s\n```\n107.175.64[.]209\n64.188.25[.]205\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK\n\n```\n[https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0115/](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0115/)\n\n\n-----",
