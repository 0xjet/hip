We identified over 200 samples of malware generated by the group over the last two years. These attacks are themed\naround Middle Eastern political issues and the motivation appears to relate to espionage, as opposed to opportunistic or criminal intentions.\n\nThese are not technically sophisticated attackers. However, they do deploy some novel tactics, detailed below, and the implications of these\nattacks could be significant. Both the tools and targets of Moonlight are reminiscent of “Gaza Hacker Team,” a group of attackers that are said\n[to be politically aligned to the Hamas[1]. In spite of these commonalities, we have not identified any firm links between the two groups.](http://blog.vectranetworks.com/blog/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks#_ftn1)\n\nWe refer to this group of attackers as _Moonlight, after the name the attackers chose for one of their command-and-control domains._\n\n[[1]](http://blog.vectranetworks.com/blog/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks#_ftnref1) [http://www.securityweek.com/gaza-cybergang-attacks-attributed-hamas](http://www.securityweek.com/gaza-cybergang-attacks-attributed-hamas)\n\n#### Moonlight’s targets\n\nVectra Networks worked with providers to sinkhole Moonlight’s command-and-control infrastructure. The hosts seen via our sinkhole show a\nclear targeting of Middle Eastern victims:\n\n**_Figure 1: Moonlight’s victims of attacks_**\n\nMost of these victims are connecting from home networks, and are therefore\nunidentifiable, though one notable victim is a Palestinian news organization.\n\nVectra believe the victims from the United States and China are outliers. These\ninfected machines were primarily from university networks and were likely either\nsecurity researchers sandboxing malware or overseas students targeted for links to\ntheir homeland.\n\nIndirect targeting data from to the online virus scanning site VirusTotal, and traffic statistics from\nthe URL linking services the attackers use indicate many of these attacks are targeted towards\neither small groups or individual targets:\n\n**_Figure 2: The statistics show one of the attacker’s malicious files, registering only two clicks_**\n\n#### OpenMe.docx.exe\n\nThe attackers name their malware as documents of interest to their victims, to\nentice them to open them. The malicious decoy documents display themes\nrelevant to Middle Eastern politics, and provide some indication as to who the\nintended targets may be:\n\n20160611-NCRI-AR-Rajavi-Syria-Ramadan.docx.exe\n\nAssassination of Talal of Jordan YouTube.exe\n\nAudio recording of the meeting of Egyptian Emirati. MP3.exe\n\nBrigadier Alleno behind moral projection of Zakaria al-Agha.docx.exe\n\nexe\n\nFatah foreign conspiracies.exe\n\nWapons and ammunition stores found while digging a waterway in Egyptian Rafah.exe\n\nHamas and Fatah agree to the following.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nHamas Betrayal.exe\n\nImportant leaking security meeting Arab Emirates.exe\n\nscr\n\nLeaked audio recording of the meeting of Egyptian security Emirates.mp3.exe\n\nLeaking important Arab Emirates security meeting.mp3.exe\n\nMeeting of the Executive Committee of the PLO.exe\n\nPresident sources oust Fatah leadership in Gaza and the cost Abu Samhadana to lead the organization.doc.exe\n\nSawiris and the project of the Suez Canal.exe\n\nSinai Bombings.docx.exe\n\nThe full truth behind Abu Ghussains disease.exe\n\nThe grandson of President Abbas in the festival of love, and what response was Mr. Samir Mashharawi him.exe\n\nThe names of the perpetrators of the bombings in the Gaza Strip.exe\n\nThe son of Mufti takfiri Hamas fist anti-drug police.docx.exe\n\nMoonlight demonstrates that 0-days, or even exploits, aren’t required to successfully compromise machines. Instead, they show a preference\nfor the classic social engineering approach of sending e-mails with attachments or links to files with the filename [legitimate fileextension].exe, for example:\n\nscr\n\nSecrets documents Panama.docx.exe\n\ndoc.exe\n\nAudio recording of the meeting of Egyptian Emirati.mp3.exe\n\nMoonlight typically makes good on the promised theme of the lures, and present the victim with a relevant “decoy document”:\n\n**_Figure 3: \"Meeting of the Executive Committee of the PLO\" - Decoy documents_**\n_opened on victim machines by the malware_\n\n**_Figure 4: Decoy video about women trafficked to Syria_**\n\n#### Impersonated new organizations\n\nThe attackers typically deploy malicious files via shortened URLs, presumably to look\nmore innocuous. Many of the links and domains impersonate Middle Eastern media\norganizations such as Eln News and Wattan TV:\n\nhttp://bit[.]do/www-elnnews-com\n\nhttp://wattan.tep[.]su/deaf.rar\n\nhttp://www.aman-news[.]com/arab/betrayal%20of%20Hamas.%20exe\n\nOne domain impersonating the media, Alwatenvoice[.]com, also hosts “landing pages”\nto encourage victims to download the malware, described below.\n\n#### Distribution\n\nOne Facebook user has shared a number of posts from the malicious Alwatenvoice[.]com:\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5: Two pages containing malware shared by the user on Facebook_**\n\nThe second post is of particular interest. The Facebook information box says the article is from All4Syria[.]info, a popular independent news\noutlet reporting on Syria, but in fact it leads to Alwatenvoice[.]com:\n\n**_Figure 6: The link to All4Syria[.]info that actually leads to Alwatenvoice[.]com_**\n\nThe user is then presented with a page that looks very much like the real All4Syria website:\n\n**_Figure 7: The malicious page on Alwatenvoice[.]com on the left, and the legitimate site All4Syria[.]nfo on the right_**\n\n\n-----\n\np p g p p y p y,\nname and Facebook profile information. Their details match that of a senior Fatah militant who Reuters reported was targeted for\nassassination during violent struggles between Hamas in Fatah in 2007.\n\nWe would stress that even if the account is controlled by the attackers it could be an account that they have compromised, or impersonates\nan innocent and unconnected person. It is also possible that the account sharing the malicious links belongs to a user who is unknowingly\nspreading malicious content.\n\n#### H-Worm\n\n[Moonlight typically delivers an obfuscated version of the widely available H-Worm[2], a malicious Visual Basic Script worm, as their first stage](http://blog.vectranetworks.com/blog/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks#_ftn1)\nbackdoor. Moonlight deploy an ever-changing range of deployment scripts to evade anti-virus software. Many of these use basic scripts within\nself-extracting RAR archives to install the malware:\n\n[[2]](http://blog.vectranetworks.com/blog/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks#_ftnref1) [https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/09/now-you-see-me-h-worm-by-houdini.html](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/09/now-you-see-me-h-worm-by-houdini.html)\n\n**_Figure 8: Some of the malicious scripts used by Moonlight to deploy H-Worm_**\n\nIn these excerpts, we see the Moonlight make some strange choices in deploying their malware such as:\n\nOpening a decoy document from the Windows System folder\n\nPreventing users from deleting any files (including the installed malware) from the C:\\temp\\ folder\n\nThere is a large amount of variation in the scripts used to install malware, and it’s likely that the large number of samples have been produced\nby hand, rather than a more productionised process of using build tools that is preferred by more sophisticated groups.\n\n#### njRat\n\nRecords to URLs that users have submitted to VirusTotal record the attackers installing additional malware using the access they gained with\n[the first stage H-Worm malware. Examples of this are recorded in URLs submitted to VirusTotal[3] for the domain fun2[.]dynu.com:](http://blog.vectranetworks.com/blog/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks#_ftn1)\n\n**Date** **Location**\n\n\n-----\n\n2016-08-10 C:/users/administrator/desktop/k.exe\n\n2016-08-10 C:/users/administrator/desktop/service.exe\n\n[[3]](http://blog.vectranetworks.com/blog/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks#_ftnref1) [https://www.virustotal.com/en/domain/fun2.dynu.com/information/](https://www.virustotal.com/en/domain/fun2.dynu.com/information/)\n\n[As with earlier stages, the attackers employ a number of methods to deploy the well-known[4] njRat which seems to vary from sample to](http://blog.vectranetworks.com/blog/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks#_ftn1)\nsample. In one example the malware stores a program within a base64 compressed blob. This is then loaded into memory, and executed\nusing EntryPoint.Invoke():\n\n**_Figure 9: An example loader for njRat deployed by Moonlight_**\n\n[[4]](http://blog.vectranetworks.com/blog/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks#_ftnref1) [http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/simple-njrat-fuels-nascent-middle-east-cybercrime-scene and](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/simple-njrat-fuels-nascent-middle-east-cybercrime-scene)\n[http://threatgeek.typepad.com/files/fta-1009---njrat-uncovered.pdf](http://threatgeek.typepad.com/files/fta-1009---njrat-uncovered.pdf)\n\nThe 24 Kb of code this decodes to is another .NET application – njRat. Other droppers also decrypt the blob, before it is executed. Both njRat\n[and code obfuscators such as this are freely available[5], and there are a plethora of tutorials available online to help budding hackers use](http://blog.vectranetworks.com/blog/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks#_ftn1)\nthem with limited technical knowledge.\n\n[[5] Eg; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dub4g4tVezI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dub4g4tVezI)\n\n#### A significant operation\n\nMoonlight’s command-and-control infrastructure is very simple. It consists of dynamic domains controlled via home internet connections in the\nWest Bank of Palestine. We were surprised to identify a very large number of varied malware samples (over 200) attached to this simple\ninfrastructure:\n\n**_Figure 10: Moonlight’s infrastructure_**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe earliest attacks appear to be non-targeted, opportunistically inviting victims to click links on Youtube videos and social media posts typical\nof Middle-Eastern “hacktivists.” Later attacks appear to target particular groups or individuals. Moonlight’s usage of the Google URL\nshortening service allows us to roughly compare attacks over time:\n\n**_Figure 11: One attack from December 2014 (left), and one from December 2015 (right)_**\n\n#### Who are the attackers?\n\nIn general, the assigned IP-location of command and control servers is a poor indication [[6] of attacker locations. However, in this case the](http://blog.vectranetworks.com/blog/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks#_ftn1)\nprovided locations of home networks in the Gaza strip are likely to be accurate and fits with other details from the attacks. The attackers also\ndemonstrate low operational security, particularly in their earlier attacks. Domain Whois records and social media posts provide strong ideas\nas to the identities of some of those involved. It would not be prudent to publish the identities of the possible attackers in a conflict zone.\n\nPerhaps a more interesting question is _\"What are the attackers’ aims?\" Or if they are being directed, who is ultimately funding and tasking_\nthem?\n\n[[6] With reference to http://www.csoonline.com/article/3028788/techology-business/norse-corp-deconstructing-threat-intelligence-on-iran.html](http://blog.vectranetworks.com/blog/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks#_ftnref1)\n[and https://threatbutt.com/map/](https://threatbutt.com/map/)\n\n#### Countering attacks\n\n\n-----\n\np p p\n\nIndividuals and organizations outside of the Middle East are unlikely to encounter the attacks by Moonlight. However, the tools and techniques\ndeployed are typical of low-skilled but determined attackers within the Middle East and serve as an example of the kinds of attacks that often\nslip through. Moonlight’s strategy of obfuscating well known malware appears to be fairly successful at evading host-based security\nmechanisms. The network communications of the well-known malware families such as H-Worm and njRat should still trigger existing network\nsignature base detection tools.\n\nVectra customers are protected through the following generic detections:\n\nSuspicious HTTP – Provides generic detection of HTTP based malware such as H-Worm\n\nExternal Remote Access –Provides generic detection of RATs such as njRat\n\nMalware Update – Provides generic detection of secondary malware over HTTP(S)\n\nSecurity professionals can review the Appendix for a full listing of file-hashes and domains employed in these attackers.\n\n[Vectra Threat Labs operates at the precise intersection of security research and data science.
