malware\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-web-redirect-service-infects-16-500-sites-to-push-malware/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-web-redirect-service-infects-16-500-sites-to-push-malware/)**\n\nBill Toulas\n\nBy\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nApril 7, 2022\n02:45 PM\n0\n\n\n-----\n\nA new traffic direction system (TDS) called Parrot is relying on servers that host 16,500\nwebsites of universities, local governments, adult content platforms, and personal blogs.\n\nParrot's use is for malicious campaigns to redirect potential victims matching a specific\nprofile (location, language, operating system, browser) to online resources such as phishing\nand malware-dropping sites.\n\n[Threat actors running malicious campaigns buy TDS services to filter incoming traffic and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tds-systems-are-the-next-big-money-makers-in-the-land-of-cybercrime/)\nsend it to a final destination serving malicious content.\n\nTDS are also legitimately used by advertisers and marketers, and some of these services\n[were exploited in the past to facilitate malspam campaigns.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/legitimate-tds-platform-abused-to-push-malware-via-exploit-kits/)\n\n## Used for RAT distribution\n\nParrot TDS was discovered by threat analysts at Avast, who report that it’s currently used for\na campaign called FakeUpdate, which delivers remote access trojans (RATs) via fake\nbrowser update notices.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Site displaying the fake browser update warning** _(Avast)_\nThe campaign appears to have started in February 2022 but signs of Parrot activity have\nbeen traced as far back as October 2021.\n\n“One of the main things that distinguishes Parrot TDS from other TDS is how widespread it is\n[and how many potential victims it has,” comments Avast in the report](https://decoded.avast.io/janrubin/parrot-tds-takes-over-web-servers-and-threatens-millions/)\n\n“The compromised websites we found appear to have nothing in common apart from servers\nhosting poorly secured CMS sites, like WordPress sites.”\n\n\n-----\n\n**Malicious**\n\n**JavaScript code seen in compromised sites** _(Avast)_\nThreat actors have planted a malicious web shell on compromised servers and copied it to\nvarious locations under similar names that follow a “parroting” pattern.\n\nMoreover, the adversaries use a PHP backdoor script that extracts client information and\nforwards requests to the Parrot TDS command and control (C2) server.\n\nIn some cases, the operators use a shortcut without the PHP script, sending the request\ndirectly to the Parrot infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Parrot's direct and proxied forwarding** _(Avast)_\nAvast says that in March 2022 alone its services protected more than 600,000 of its clients\nfrom visiting these infected sites, indicating the massive scale of the Parrot redirection\ngateway.\n\nMost of the users targeted by these malicious redirections were in Brazil, India, the United\nStates, Singapore, and Indonesia.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Parrot's redirection attempts heatmap** _(Avast)_\nAs Avast details in the report, the particular campaign’s user profile and filtering are so finetuned that the malicious actors can target a specific person from thousands of redirected\nusers.\n\nThis is achieved by sending that target to unique payload-dropping URLs based on extensive\nhardware, software, and network profiling.\n\nThe payload dropped on the targets' systems is the NetSupport Client RAT set to run in silent\nmode, which provides direct access to the compromised machines.\n\n\n-----\n\n**The details of the dropped**\n\n**payload** _(Avast)_\n\n## Phishing Microsoft credentials\n\nWhile the RAT campaign is currently the main operation served by the Parrot TDS, Avast\nanalysts have also noticed several infected servers hosting phishing sites.\n\nThose landing pages resemble a legitimate-looking Microsoft login page asking visitors to\nenter their account credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\n**One of the phishing sites served by the Parrot TDS** _(Avast)_\nFor users who browse the web, having an up-to-date internet security solution running at all\ntimes is the best way to deal with malicious redirections.\n\nFor admins of potentially compromised web servers, Avast recommends the following\nactions:\n\nScan all files on the webserver with an antivirus.\nReplace all JavaScript and PHP files on the webserver with original ones.\nUse the latest CMS version and plugins versions.\nCheck for automatically running tasks on the web server like cron jobs.\nAlways use unique and strong credentials for every service and all accounts, and add\n2FA where possible.\nUse some of the available security plugins for WordPress and Joomla\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers target Russian
