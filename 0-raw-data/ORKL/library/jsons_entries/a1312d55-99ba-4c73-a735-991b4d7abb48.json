Executive Summary\n\nDesert Falcons is a new group of cybermercenaries operating from the Middle East and using\na set of methods to hide and operate malware. The cybercriminals appear to be highly skilled:\nin addition to proficient social engineering tricks, they have developed the following from\nscratch:\n\n- Computer systems malware targeting Windows devices\n\n- Mobile malware targeting Android devices\n\n- Infection vectors, including phishing emails, fake websites and fake social networking\naccounts\n\nPotential victims were enticed with socio-political news and information, and many\nsuccumbed rapidly to malware infection.\n\nThe victims targeted include:\n\n- Military and Government\n\n- Newspaper, TV/Radio Channels and Top Media Outlets\n\n- Financial and Trading Institutions\n\n- Research and Education Institutions\n\n- Activists and Political Leaders\n\n- Energy Firms\n\n- Physical Security Companies\n\nVictims of the Desert Falcons are located mainly in the following countries:\n\n- Egypt\n\n- Palestine\n\n- Israel\n\n- Jordan\n\nThe Desert Falcons cybercriminals are native Arabic speakers; and it is believed to be the first\nknown Arab group to develop and run a full cyber espionage operation. Desert Falcons began\nits operations in 2011, with the first infections taking place in 2013. The group became very\nactive in late 2014/early 2015.\n\nThe Desert Falcons comprises around 30 members working in three teams and operating\nmainly out of Palestine, Egypt and Turkey.\n\nThe number of victims to date exceeds 3,000.\n\nThe group’s malware was originally found during an attack investigation in the Middle East.\nKaspersky Lab clients are protected from infection, with the malware files and domains used\nin the targeted attacks detected and blocked.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 2. Introduction\n\nThe geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East have deepened over the last few years. The crisis\nis taking many forms, and the conflict in cyberspace is intensifying as different sides try to shift\nthe struggle in their favour by exploiting cyber intelligence and distorting news.\n\nTargeted cyberattacks have also increased rapidly in the region over the last few years, with\nvictims identified for almost every one of the major advanced cyberattack campaigns (Regin,\nEpic Turla, Careto, Nettraveler, Red October, Flame, Gauss, Duqu, and more.)\n\nThe Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky Lab has uncovered new\ntargeted attacks in the Middle East. Native Arabic-speaking cybercriminals have built advanced\nmethods and tools to deliver, hide and operate malware that they have also developed\nthemselves. This malware was originally discovered during an investigation of one of the\nattacks in the Middle East.\n\nPolitical activities and news are being actively used by the cybercriminals to entice victims\ninto opening files and attachments. Content has been created with professionalism, with well\ndesigned visuals and interesting, familiar details for the victims, as if the information were long\nawaited.\n\nThe victims of the attacks to date have been carefully chosen; they are active and influential\nin their respective cultures, but also attractive to the cybercriminals as a source of intelligence\nand a target for extortion.\n\nThe attackers have been operating for more than two years now, running different\ncampaigns, targeting different types of victims and different types of devices (including\nWindows- and Android-based). We suspect that at least 30 people distributed across\ndifferent countries are operating the campaigns.\n\nAs a security organization, our analysis has focused only on the malware and the facts\nuncovered during our research.\n\nThe falcon is a popular and rare bird that has existed for a long time in Arabian countries\nwith deserts, such as Egypt, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, and\nOman, among others. It is also a symbol of hunting and sharp vision. The Desert Falcons are\nproficient cyberattackers, with carefully chosen targets, who are all thoroughly investigated\nbefore being attacked and infected.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 3. Operation Goals and Victim Profiles\n\nOne of the most mysterious things about the Falcons is the range and variety of victims; with\nclear political, geographical and social distinctions between them.\n\n###### Further details of individual categories of victims\n\n\nVictim Category Victim Description\n\n\nMedia Organizations and popular senior reporters from large and small, global and local media\norganizations, with wide coverage in the Middle East region\n\n\n-----\n\nA screenshot from one of the physical security providers targeted shows the attackers’ interest\nin information about security officers and their assignments. It is possible that these victims\nwere targeted in order to collect useful information that could be used in actual physical crime.\n\n### 3.1. Stolen Files information\n\nThe Desert Falcons’ operations were found to be mainly focused on political and military\nintelligence. In all, the attackers were able to steal more than one million files and\ndocuments containing sensitive information from victims’ computers and devices.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 4. Operation Analysis\n\nThe Desert Falcons make use of different tools and techniques to Deliver, Infect, Spy on\nand Manage their victims. Below we outline each of the methods involved and how they were\ncarefully used to operate the cyber espionage activities. They are grouped into three sections\nas follows:\n\n- Deceive and Infect\n\n- Infiltrate and Spy\n\n- Track and Control\n\n### 4.1. Deceive and Infect\n\nMalware writers use multiple technical and social engineering methods to deliver their files\nand encourage the victims to run them; creating an effective infection vector, even when they\nare targeting what should be well-protected organisations such as governments, banks and\nleading media outlets. In this case the attackers depended mainly on social engineering to\nexploit:\n\n- Victims’ trust in social networking forums\n\n- Victims’ curiosity about news relating to political conflict in their country\n\nIn the following sections we outline the different methods used by the cybercriminals to infect\ntheir victims.\n\n##### 4.1.1. Targeted emails and documents\n\nThe Falcons attacks used spear phishing e-mails that attempted to trick the victim into opening\na malicious attachment. Spear phishing was mainly used when targeting important victims\nsuch as governments or high profile media.\n\nThe spear phishing e-mails used by the Falcons were very well structured with filenames\nand attachments selected with care for the targeted victim.\n\n###### Email samples\n\n\nEmail information Time of delivery\n\n\nFrom: ( السكرتير التنفيذي Executive Secretary)\nSubject: ( المستحقات المالية The financial benefits)\nAttachment: \u0007//.المستحقات rar//.التقرير الفاصل بخصوص المستحقات scr\n(a detailed report on the benefits)\n\n\nMarch 2014\n\n\nFrom: ( االعالمية رنا The media reporter Rana)\nSubject: \u0007اود تذكيرك باالجتماع) مدير مكتب المحامي ديفيد.

Just click the shortcut: the rar/lnk trick\n\nAnother technique used by the cybercriminals is to send a rar file that extracts to multiple\nfiles and offers an appealing shortcut in the form of a small, innocent-looking icon. In this\ncase the victim does not need to double-click an executable file, the shortcut is enough to\nrun a whole command to extract, setup and run the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 4.1.3. Right-to-left extension override trick\n\nThis method takes advantage of special characters in Unicode to reverse the order of\ncharacters in a file name, hiding the dangerous file extension in the file name and placing a\nharmless-looking fake file extension near the end of the file name. By using this technique,\neven careful users with good technical knowledge could be tricked into running malicious files.\n\n##### 4.1.4. Social Networking tricks\n\n###### Targeted Facebook attacks aimed at specific people\nThe Desert Falcons team is among to the first to run targeted attacks through Facebook chat.\nThe attackers created authentic Facebook accounts and then interacted with chosen victims\nthrough common Facebook pages until they had gained their trust. Then they sent them\nTrojan files in the chat hidden as an image or similar.\n\nBelow are some screenshots of a victim’s PC showing the infection process, extracted from\none of the command and control servers:\n\n\n-----\n\nMalware files being sent as me.rar or mypic.rar from fake accounts to the victims through chat\n\n###### Facebook attacks targeted at generic activists and political followers (mass infection)\nFor wider infections, especially among activists and political figures, different social engineering\ntechniques were used. These included Facebook posts and redirects to fake pages with\npolitical content. We were able to identify suspect Facebook posts on popular activist pages,\nwith links to domains or malware downloads used by Falcons. Below are a few examples:\n\n\n-----\n\nPosts made from compromised or fake accounts on political pages; Dr Salam Fayyad is a\nformer prime minister of the state of Palestine.\n\nAnother post with malicious content, this time on the page of Benjamin Netanyahu, the\ncurrent prime minister of Israel.\n\n##### 4.1.5. The fake RealPlayer plugin trick\n\nIn this case political social engineering was used to deliver malware as a “plugin” for the\n“banned video” of a famous political show in Egypt hosted by the satirist Bassem Youssef.\n[The page was hosted on the following domain: www.linkedim.in, chosen to resemble the](http://www.linkedim.in)\npopular LinkedIn social networking site.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 4.2. Infiltrate and Spy\n\nThe Desert Falcons depend on two different backdoors to spy on victims. Both backdoors\nare homemade and are under continuous development. We were able to identify and collect\nmore than 100 malware samples used by the Desert Falcons.\n\nOnce they have infected the victim’s computer, attackers have full access and control, and\nthey usually proceed as follows:\n\n1. New victims are categorized into groups before being infected (e.g. A001, A002, and so on)\n2. One of the cybercriminals is appointed to each new victim after infection\n3. A complete list of all files (especially XLS, DOC, JPG and WAV) is retrieved from the victim’s\nmachine\n4. The cybercriminal browses and collects any interesting pictures and files\n5. The cybercriminal also collects chats and screenshots\n6. Depending on the importance of the victim, the surveillance is then either intensified or\ndropped\n\n##### 4.2.1. The Falcons’ main Trojan\n\nThis is the main Trojan used in the attacks, especially when targeting important\nvictims. Multiple versions of the Trojan were found, revealing ongoing development and\nimprovements.\n\nThe Falcons’ main Trojan is divided into two modules:\n\n###### 4.2.1.1. Falcons’ Downloader\nThis module is used for the initial infection. Once executed, the Falcons’ downloader will\nsend a registration request to the Command and Control (C&C) server with the victim’s IP\naddress and a harddisk ID. The downloader will request a registration confirmation from\nthe C&C. Encrypted versions of the latest Falcons’ backdoor will then be downloaded and\ninstalled on the victim’s machine.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 4.2.1.2. Falcons’ Backdoor\nThe Falcons’ backdoor communicates with C&C servers using HTTP requests with encrypted\ncontent, providing the attackers with full backdoor functionality including:\n\n- Screenshots\n\n- Keylogs\n\n- Upload/Download files\n\n- Information on all the .doc and .xls files on the victim’s hard disk or connected USB\ndevices\n\n- The ability to steal passwords stored on the system registry (Internet Explorer and live\nMessenger)\n\nAll the files and screenshots collected by the backdoor are sent to the C&C in a passwordprotected archive.\n\nThe earliest sample we found of the Falcons’ Trojan was compiled in Feb 2013. We consider\nthis to be the real start date for the infection activity. (c07ac2120b4312b33089c0\ncc97405876, MSN.exe).\n\n##### 4.2.2. DHS spyware\n\nDHS naming is used by the attackers to describe the nickname initials of one of the\ndevelopers (D** H*** Spyware).\n\nFrom June 2014, the Falcons began using a new, totally rewritten backdoor, the “DHS\nspyware”, is built by a different development team. This also provided the attackers with\ncontrol over the infected systems, serving the same goals as before through the following\nfunctionalities:\n\n- Screenshots and Keylogs\n\n- Audio recording\n\n- Downloading and Uploading files\n\n- Password stealing\n\n- Interactive shell\n\n\n-----\n\nDHS builder, used to bind malware with an icon and the category to which the victim belongs.\n\nScreen shot for DHS C&C management console\n\n##### 4.2.3. DHS2015, also called iRat\n\nBeginning 2015, DHS released a new, almost final version of the Trojan malware, now\npacked with new features and techniques to escape detection, but also adding encryption\nto the C&C communication and file storage. The new malware has been named DHS2015 or\niRAT.\n\n##### 4.2.4. Mobile backdoor traces\n\nDuring the investigation of the C&C servers we found traces of data pointing to mobile Trojan\nlogs on the C&C www.fpupdate.info. The traces represent a structure for a mobile spying\ncommand server, the server contains mobile Call logs, SMS logs and Geolocation tracking\nfor more than 360 victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 4.2.5. Other tools by DHS\n\nThe cybercriminals also developed other tools, for example, a public/private key-based file\ncryptor/decryptor tool.\n\nMD5: 363d7b99fee999a4c39a2a1052fa7919\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 4.2.6. Compilation timeline for samples\n\nThe malware files compilation timeline for the collected samples clearly shows the Falcons’\nactivity and operations, which started in 2013 and increased dramatically in 2014.\n\n### 4.3. Track and Control\n\nThe Desert Falcons’ operation can be divided into three different campaigns, each operated\nfrom a different C&C/IP, targeting different types of victims and operated mostly by different\nteam members.\n\nThe campaigns can be classified by the type and version of malware and the type of victims\ntargeted:\n\n- Campaign 1: \u0007Active in Palestine, Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf states (KSA, UAE and Qatar)\n\n- Campaign 2: Active in Israel\n\n- Campaign 3: Active in Egypt\n\n##### 4.3.1. 1[st] Campaign - targeting computer devices and mobiles\n\nThis is the main Falcons’ campaign and included the highest number of victims. It focused\nmainly high profile victims in Palestine, Jordan, Egypt and the Gulf states, and the target\nvictims were mainly government organizations, military centers and top media outlets.\n\n\nC&C Domains IPs Victims Malware used Registration Date\n\n\nahmedfaiez.info 188.40.75.132 Media & Falcons Trojan 2013-03-29\n188.40.106.84 Government\n\nfpupdate.info 188.40.75.132 Mobile Falcons Trojan 2013-04-14\n\n\n-----\n\nflushupate.com 188.40.75.132 Falcons Trojan 2014-02-16\n\nflushupdate.com 188.40.75.132 Media Falcons Trojan 2014-02-16\n\nineltdriver.com 188.40.75.132 Military & Falcons Trojan 2014-09-14\nGovernment\n\nmediahitech.info 188.40.106.84 Unknown Falcons Trojan 2012-06-28\n\n##### 4.3.2. 2[nd] Campaign\n\nThis campaign mainly targeted victims in Israel using the main Falcons Trojan. More than\n600 victims have been identified.\n\n\nC&C Domains IPs Victims Malware used Registration Date\n\n\nmixedwork.com 188.40.81.136 Israeli Victims Falcons Trojan 2014-02-18\n\nplmedgroup.com 188.40.81.136 Israeli Victims Falcons Trojan 2014-02-18\n\npstcmedia.com 188.40.81.136 Unknown, currently Falcons Trojan 2013-07-04\nsinkholed\n\n##### 4.3.3. 3[rd] Campaign\n\nThis targeted mainly activists, political figures and radio/TV channels in Egypt. It’s the only\ncampaign in the Falcons’ operations that used the DHS spyware.\n\n\nC&C Domains IPs Victims Malware used Registration Date\n\n\nadvtravel.info 188.40.106.84 Activists DHS Spyware 2013-11-17\n\nlinksis.info 188.40.106.84 Politicians and DHS 2015/IRat 2014-12-01\nActivists\n\nBesides being the only campaign to use DHS spyware, we can confirm this is also the most\nrecent, managed by new and less experienced group members. This is apparent from\nmistakes made in the campaign operation. For example, the C&C server advtravel.info was\npublicly accessible, despite containing files, screenshots and information collected from the\nvictims and the backdoor execution logs.\n\n\n-----\n\nFile and folder structure on one of the command servers. For a short time the file access\npermissions for the command servers were made public.\n\n##### 4.3.4 Liptona.net\n\nOne of the interesting findings that could indicate an earlier start to the Falcons’ operations\nis the Liptona.net domain. The hosting history for this domain shows that between 21 June\n2012 and December 2013, this domain was pointing to one of the IPs (188.40.106.84) used\nby the Falcons.\n\nWe were able to find a malware sample using Liptona.net as a C&C\n(667b5004fa197beb0129e1ddbc416864). This sample has some similarities to the\nFalcons’ main backdoor and the compilation time for the sample points back to Dec 2011.\nOne interesting thing is that this sample tries to steal login credentials for hardcoded URLs of\nPalestinian websites, an indication of a shared goal with the Falcons’ team.\n\nWebsites hardcoded in the malware:\n\n- [http://mail.mtit.pna.ps/src/login.php (Email Ministry of Telecommunications and](http://mail.mtit.pna.ps/src/login.php)\nInformation Technology Palestine )\n\n- [http://myaccount.jawwal.ps/ (Jawwal Mobile provider)](http://myaccount.jawwal.ps/)\n\n- http://portal.iugaza.edu.ps/ (Islamic University of Gaza)\n\nMalware using liptona.net as C&C containing hardcoded URLs for Palestinian websites\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 4.3.4. Campaigns operational timeline\n\nEven though malware files were only traced back to 2013, domain-related traces were found\nthat may indicate earlier activities by the Desert Falcons:\n\n\n-----\n\n## 5. Attribution\n\nThe investigation into the Desert Falcons cybermercenaries enabled the research team to\ndetermine the identity of some members of the group behind the development and operation\nof the campaigns.\n\nThe Desert Falcons team members count around 30, working in three teams and operating\nmainly from Palestine, Egypt and Turkey.\n\nWe also confirmed that the cybercriminals are native Arabic speakers from the Middle East,\nbased on evidence from:\n\n- The identities found\n\n- The fact that most malware files have the PE resource “Version Info” with “Lang property”\nset to “Arabic”\n\n- Arabic User names for the C&C administrators\n\n- Arabic names and emails found in the registration history of the C&C domains\n\n- Solid Arabic phishing emails and documents used in attacks\n\n- DHS spyware command and control panel with Arabic interface\n\nThe identities of some of the cybercriminals were found when inspecting the contents of one\nof the C&Cs which had public read permissions open for a short period of time. We were able\nto track and identify the full profile of some of the attackers including Facebook and twitter\naccounts, private blogs and websites. Surprisingly the attackers have published on twitter\nsome information about their development of the spyware and the command servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\nThe Desert Falcons’ attacks show clearly that zeroday techniques are not a must for efficient\ntargeted attacks. Using phishing emails, social engineering and homemade tools and\nbackdoors, the Desert Falcons were able to infect hundreds of sensitive and important\nvictims in the Middle East region through their computer systems or mobile devices.\n\nThis is just an alert for the poor cyber security situation in the region. Banks, Media outlets,\nGovernments and Military entities in different countries all fell prey to the Desert Falcons’\nattacks.\n\nFalcons’ threat actors are determined, active and have good technical knowledge. We expect\ntheir operations to carry on developing more Trojans and using more advanced techniques.\nWith enough funding, they might be able to acquire or develop exploits that would increase\nthe efficiency of their attacks\n\nDesert Falcons is just one example of the rise of cybercrime in a geopolitically troubled\nregion that will motivate other threat actors or states to leverage cyber attacks for political or\ncriminal goals.\n\nKaspersky Lab detects all the malware files as follows:\n\n- Trojan.Win32.DesertFalcons\n\n- Trojan-Spy.Win32.Agent.cncc\n\n- Trojan-Spy.Win32.Agent.ctcr\n\n- Trojan-Spy.Win32.Agent.ctcv\n\n- Trojan-Spy.Win32.Agent.ctcx\n\n- Trojan-Spy.Win32.Agent.cree\n\n- Trojan-Spy.Win32.Agent.ctbz\n\n- Trojan-Spy.Win32.Agent.comn\n\n- Trojan.Win32.Bazon.a\n\n\n-----\n\n## 7.
