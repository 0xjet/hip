Blog](https://securityscorecard.com/blog)\n\nBy Ryan Slaney, Staff, Threat Researcher\n\nPosted on March 10th, 2022\n\n**Executive Summary**\n\nSecurityScorecard (SSC) has identified three separate DDoS attacks which all targeted\nUkrainian government and financial websites leading up to and during Russia’s\ninvasion of Ukraine. Details of these DDoS attacks have not yet been publicly\nidentified.\n\nSSC discovered a botnet of more than 3,000 unique IP addresses, across multiple\ncountries and continents, that were the source of the DDoS attacks which consisted of\nHTTP floods and DNS amplification. SSC has named this botnet “Zhadnost” – Russian\nfor “Greed.”\n\nMost Zhadnost bots are routers, the majority of them MikroTik, with misconfigured DNS\nrecursion settings and other known vulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DDoS attacks appeared to have had a minimal, temporary impact on their targets.\nGovernment websites and banking services were quickly restored and customers'\nbalances were not affected.\n\nWe assess that the IP addresses used in the first DDoS attack were a combination of\nZhadnost bots and other botnets possibly controlled by criminal actors, who partnered\nwith or were hired by the same threat actor. The second and third DDoS attacks used\nonly Zhadnost bots.\n\nAttributing Zhadnost and the DDoS attacks to any one threat actor is difficult, however,\nwe assess with moderate confidence that Russia, or Russian-aligned actors, are likely\nbehind this DDoS campaign.\n\n**Background**\n\nOn November 10, 2021, reports emerged of unusual movement of Russian troops near the\nborders of Ukraine. By November 28, Ukraine reported a build up of 92,000 Russian troops.\nIn January 2022, Russian troops began arriving in Belarus for military exercises. Throughout\nDecember 2021 and January 2022, a series of diplomatic talks took place between Russia,\nNATO, and Ukraine during which Russia proposed limits on NATO’s activities in eastern\nEurope, such as a prohibition on Ukraine ever joining NATO. NATO/Ukraine rejected these\nproposals and warned Russia of strong economic and other measures should it invade\nUkraine. Russia continued to build up its forces along Ukraine’s border with Russia and\nBelarus, and in the Black Sea. NATO and Western countries pledged their support to Ukraine\nand began providing lethal and non-lethal military equipment, intelligence, and financial aid\nto help Ukraine defend itself from Russian aggression.\n\nOn February 24, Russian President Putin announced he had decided to launch a “special\nmilitary operation” in Ukraine. Shortly thereafter, explosions were reported in several\nUkrainian cities and Russian military vehicles began crossing Ukrainian borders on several\nfronts.\n\nThis whitepaper specifically discusses SecurityScorecard’s investigation into the use of\nDDoS attacks against Ukrainian infrastructure leading up to and during Russia’s invasion of\nUkraine. We have identified three separate DDoS attacks which all targeted Ukrainian\ngovernment and financial websites in a likely effort to take them offline, thereby denying and\ndegrading access to news, information, and currency from official Ukrainian government and\nfinancial sources.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nAccording to various open sources and media reports, as well as SecurityScorecard’s own\ndata, the following websites were targeted by DDoS attacks on three different occasions:\n\n**Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs - mfa.gov.ua**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ukrainian Ministry of Defence - mil.gov.ua**\n\n**Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs - mvs.gov.ua**\n\n**Security Service of Ukraine - ssu.gov.ua**\n\n**Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers - kmu.gov.ua**\n\n**Oschadbank - oschadbank.ua**\n\n**Privatbank - privatbank.ua**\n\nWe resolved the IP addresses of these domains and conducted netflow analysis for the\nperiod corresponding with the DDoS attacks. From the available netflow results, we\ndiscovered more than 3,000 unique IP addresses–spanning multiple countries and\ncontinents–that were the source of the DDoS attacks. Of note, none of the IP addresses\ninvolved in any of the observed DDoS attacks were located in Russia or Belarus. We then\nconducted further research and analysis on the 50 most active IP addresses from each\nattack using proprietary data enrichment techniques and open and closed intelligence\nsources.\n\n**February 15 DDoS Attack**\n\nOn February 15, 2022, Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov,\nannounced that a cyberattack against the websites of Ukraine’s defense ministry and army,\nas well as the interfaces of the country’s two largest banks, was the largest assault of its kind\nin the country's history and “bore traces of foreign intelligence services.” Ilya Vityuk, the head\nof the Ukrainian Intelligence Agency’s Cyber Security Department, blamed Russia for the\nattack, citing as evidence that the attack likely cost “millions of dollars” to execute, far beyond\nthe capabilities of individual hackers or groups. He asserted that Russia is the only country\nthat is interested in such strikes on Ukraine.\n\nFrom our analysis, SSC has identified more than 200 unique IP addresses that were\ninvolved in the February 15 DDoS attack. The attack consisted of HTTPS flooding on port\n[443. This type of attack is designed to overwhelm a targeted server with HTTP requests.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http/)\nOnce the target has been saturated with requests and is unable to respond to normal traffic,\na [denial-of-service will occur for additional requests from actual users. Analysis of the 50](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/denial-of-service/)\nmost active IP addresses revealed that approximately half of them appear to be MikroTik\nrouters, or other devices running SquidProxy.\n\nOur data also revealed that the majority of the IP addresses have previously been\nassociated with activity from the following implants:\n\nXorddos\n\nCobaltstrike\n\n\n-----\n\nAmadey\n\nTrickbot\n\nQakbot\n\nLokibot\n\nJedobot\n\nBluebot\n\nBetabot\n\nGumblar\n\nKasidet\n\nPonyLoader\n\nSmokeloader\n\nUnfortunately, SSC is not able to determine from the available data if the malicious HTTP\nrequests were sent from the router themselves, compromised hosts behind them, or a\ncombination of both. This makes attributing this particular attack to any one threat actor\nextremely difficult. Our work here continues.\n\nFortunately, this attack appeared to have minimal impact on its targets. According to a\nstatement from Victor Zhora of the Ukrainian Center for Strategic Communications and\nInformation Security, Ukrainian cybersecurity officials managed to significantly reduce the\namount of harmful traffic to the websites. Furthermore, while the targeted banks confirmed\nthe attack, they indicated that users had only been temporarily unable to withdraw money\nfrom their accounts. Banking services were quickly restored and customers’ balances were\nnot affected.\n\n**February 23 and 28 DDoS Attacks**\n\nOn February 23, another DDoS attack against Ukrainian websites was again reported by\nMykhailo Fedorov.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 1: Mykhailo Fedorov’s Telegram\n\nSSC discovered another DDoS attack that took place between February 27 - 28 that was\nlargely unreported in the media, likely since such attacks were becoming commonplace at\nthis point.\n\nFrom our analysis, SSC has identified more than 3,000 unique IP addresses that were\ninvolved in DDoS attacks on February 23 and 27-28. Analysis of these IP addresses\nrevealed that the vast majority of them are running “MikroTik Bandwidth-test server” on port\n2000, with a connection signature of \\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00, recursion enabled on UDP/TCP port\n53, and multiple versions of MikroTik RouterOS services on various ports. Analysis of the 50\nmost active IPs from the second and third attacks revealed that 76% and 92%, respectively,\ncan be identified as MikroTik devices.\n\nImage 2: Percentage of MikroTik Devices\n\n100% of the IPs we identified had DNS recursion enabled on port 53. SSC assesses that the\nthreat actor sent spoofed DNS requests to the MikroTik devices, which allowed DNS\nrecursion. The requests were then processed as valid and returned to the spoofed recipients,\nin this case the targeted Ukrainian websites. This is known as an amplifier attack because\nthis method takes advantage of misconfigured DNS servers to reflect the attack onto a target\nwhile amplifying the volume of packets. SSC has named the botnet used to conduct the\nsecond and third DDoS attacks “Zhadnost”--Russian for “Greed.”\n\n\n-----\n\nZhadnost is somewhat similar to the Mēris botnet discovered by Russia-based companies\nYandex and Qrator Labs in 2021. Yandex/Qrator Labs reported that 90 to 95% of the Mēris\nbots that had recently attacked Yandex with a DDoS attack had MikroTik Bandwidth Test\nrunning on port 2000 with a connection signature of \\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00. According to a\ndifferent report released by NetScout on October 28, 2021, NetScout discovered that there\nare at least two distinct MikroTik-based IoT botnets inhabiting the same population of\nunpatched, exploitable MikroTik routers; Mēris, which uses HTTP Pipelining as a form of\nattack, and a botnet called Dvinis (Latvian for “twin”), which does not. Instead, Dvinis uses an\napparent typo in the attack generator which appends an extra ‘/’ character to the end of the\nURIs targeted in HTTP POST and GET floods.\n\nIn response to the Yandex/Qrator labs discovery, MikroTik released a report indicating\n\nMēris bots are MikroTik routers that were compromised in 2018, when MikroTik RouterOS\nhad a vulnerability that was quickly patched. There was no new vulnerability in RouterOS\nand there was no malware hiding inside the RouterOS filesystem, rather the attacker was\nreconfiguring RouterOS devices for remote access, using commands and features of\nRouterOS itself. Unfortunately, closing the old vulnerability does not immediately protect\nthese routers.\n\nAlthough MikroTik provided mitigation advice in its statement, it did not mention anything\nabout ensuring that DNS recursion was properly configured. But there is evidence that\nMikroTik is aware of this vulnerability. According to MikroTik’s website, every MIkroTik that\nhas the“Allow-Remote-Requests” feature turned on is a potential attack vector, representing\na 1:179 bandwidth amplification factor.\n\nPreliminary analysis using Qrator Labs’ Mēris identification tool has revealed that none of the\nZhadnost IP addresses are part of the Mēris botnet. No such identification tool for Dvinis\nnodes exists. However, only the first attack consisted of HTTP floods, which Dvinis is known\nfor. Zhadnost bots don’t require a compromised router, simply a router with misconfigured\nDNS recursion. Therefore, SSC assesses that it is also unlikely that Zhadnost IPs are part of\nDvinis. Thus, we believe they are a new botnet, controlled by a different actor.\n\nThe analysis of the 50 most active Zhadnost bots/MikroTik routers used in the second and\nthird attack has also revealed that several devices behind them have previously been\nassociated with activity from the following implants:\n\nAmadey\n\nBetabot\n\nGumblar\n\nLokibot\n\n\n-----\n\nPonyloader\n\nWe assess that the implant activity is incidental, and not connected to the deployment of\nZhadnost bots.\n\nTo create Zhadnost, all the threat actor had to do was establish and maintain a list of\nMikroTik and other devices with misconfigured DNS recursion settings, which would forward\nspoofed requests to the targeted websites. This could be easily done using tools such as\nShodan and Google Dorks. According to our Attack Surface Intelligence Data, there are at\nleast 875,000 MikroTik devices located all over the world. This could potentially represent a\nnear infinite number of bots, provided DNS recursion is not properly configured on these\ndevices.\n\nImage 3. Location and density of MikroTik devices. (Source: SSC Attack Surface\nIntelligence)\n\n**Attribution**\n\nAttributing Zhadnost and the DDoS attacks to any one threat actor is difficult, given that\nanyone could have taken advantage of this misconfiguration with little effort. Furthermore, it\nis difficult to differentiate the traffic from the router itself from the legitimate traffic of the\ndevices behind it, making identification of the command and control infrastructure extremely\ndifficult. However, taking into account the current geopolitical factors, and considering which\ncountry is likely to gain from such attacks, SSC can assess with moderate confidence that\nRussia, or Russian-aligned actors, are likely behind this DDoS campaign.\n\n**Key Insights**\n\nDespite the involvement of MikroTik devices in all three attacks, further comparison reveals\nthat the first attack is quite different from the second or third:\n\n**Attack Date** **Feb 15th** **Feb 23rd** **February 28th**\n\n**% MikroTik** 50% 76% 92%\n\n\n-----\n\n**DDoS Attack Type** HTTP Flood DNS Amplification DNS Amplification\n\n**# of unique IPs** 200 1892 1958\n\n**% previously compromised** 50% 4% 12%\n\n**DNS Recursion Enabled %** 20% 100% 100%\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of three attacks.\n\nBased on these differences, SSC assesses with moderate confidence that the IP addresses\nused to conduct the second and third DDoS attacks against Ukrainian government and\nfinancial websites were solely Zhadnost bots, meaning MikroTik and other routers with\nmisconfigured DNS recursion settings. We assess that the IP addresses used in the first\nattack were a combination of Zhadnost bots and other botnets possibly controlled by criminal\nactors, who partnered with or were hired by the same threat actor.\n\nSSC also assesses with moderate confidence that the DDoS attacks had very limited impact\non their targets. This is likely a result of Ukraine being adequately prepared to handle such\nattacks, since similar tactics had been used during previous attacks. Furthermore, various\nUkrainian officials have made public statements regarding Ukraine’s success in minimizing\nthe effects of attacks.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nSo far, the DDoS attacks SSC has observed have been targeted towards government and\nfinancial websites, and do not appear to have much of an impact. This leads to the possibility\nthat the threat actor will target more critical targets in the next attacks, such as networks\nused for power generation, communications, and by hospitals and military units.\n\nAs the Russian military’s efforts become more aggressive to overcome the stiff Ukrainian\nresistance, we expect the cyber attacks towards Ukraine to follow suit. We also expect to see\nattacks on NATO and Western countries, in retaliation for the sanctions placed on Russia\nand the aid provided to Ukraine.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nSSC recommends that organizations check the DNS recursion settings in their routers,\nwhether they are MikroTik or another vendor. It is recommended that DNS recursion is\ndisabled if it is not required. If required, it should be configured to only conduct\nrecursion for trusted domains/hosts.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is critical to put DDoS mitigations in place, via a service like Cloudflare, Akamai, or\nAWS Cloudfront. Having a firewall will not stop the volume of traffic we have observed\nagainst Ukrainian targets via netflow analysis.\n\nFurthermore, blocking Russian IPs will not stop DDoS attacks. The attacks are coming\nfrom across the world from neutral countries in Latin America, EU (not Russia or\nBelarus), and southeast Asia.\n\n**IoCs**\n\nPlease contact [[email protected] for IoCs associated with Zhadnost and the DDoS attacks on](https://securityscorecard.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2d44435b485e59444a4c594442435e6d5e484e585f4459545e4e425f484e4c5f49034442)\nUkrainian websites.\n\n**Standing up for Peace and Democracy**\n\nSecurityScorecard (SSC) stands with Ukraine during this difficult time in its history.
