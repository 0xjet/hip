I found this assessment dangerously wrong and inaccurate\nso let me explain here why and maybe my post will help others avoid similar\noversimplifications.\n\nI cannot reference classified attribution intelligence products, but one of the most reputable\npublic sources is Välisluureamet, Estonia’s foreign intelligence service. In Välisluureamet’s\n2018 [unclassified report they attributed those groups to specific organizations within the](https://www.valisluureamet.ee/pdf/raport-2018-ENG-web.pdf)\nRussian Federation government. So let’s assume that this is accurate for the sake of this\nblog post.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhy is it dangerously wrong to communicate that getting targeted by APT28, APT29 or\nTurla is “Russia targeting you” rather than the specific actors? Simply because they are\nsignificantly different organizations, with different modus operandi, different objectives, and\ndifferent TTPs. This means that your threat model will be entirely different if you want to be\nprotected against APT28 versus Turla or APT29. To be more precise…\n\n**APT28 (GRU’s 6th Directorate/Military Intelligence)**\nA military intelligence agency is usually after intelligence of military value. Specifically this\nagency has shown that they are one of the most active actors in cyber with massive\nresources but not extremely sophisticated. Of course, when there are big geopolitical events,\nmilitary research, investigations on Russian military activities or military exercises they will be\naround, and they will be after any connected systems that can get them military intelligence\n\n\n-----\n\nthat could benefit the Russian Federation and its allies. They have been seen using all\nintelligence disciplines without any noticeable preference on cyber over other means of\ncollection.\n\n**APT29 (SVR/Foreign Intelligence)**\nThis is the equivalent of the CIA for Russia and just like the CIA, their cyber operations are\ntypically more on the targeted and less on the bulk collection. In numerous occasions they\nhave been seen conducting close access operations, and their objectives typically are\nrelated to political and economical information. For example, finding dirt to recruit someone\nas an SVR agent or finding out the details of a commercial agreement or research that could\nbenefit the Russian state or its allies. They are less in the SIGINT and more in the HUMINT\nspace so they are more likely to recruit an insider to get them what they want than perform\nan extremely sophisticated cyber operation.\n\n**Turla (FSB’s 16th Center/Signals Intelligence)**\nTurla is the equivalent of the NSA’s Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID) and because of\nthat, they are one of the most sophisticated cyber actors out there operating at a level similar\nto that of the NSA, including bulk collection. This means that they collect intelligence for a\nvariety of agencies both for Russia but also Russia’s allies under various agreements. So\ntheir target space is massive and they are the most advanced cyber operators of the Russian\ngovernment. They have a massive organization and their sole purpose is SIGINT. So if you\nare targeted by Turla then expect some very advanced and complex cyber operations. Also,\nif you are targeted by Turla it doesn’t mean that it’s Russia targeting you, it could be that they\nexecute an intelligence collection agreement for an ally of Russia that doesn’t have such\ncyber intelligence collection capabilities, similarly to what the NSA’s SID and other large\nSIGINT agencies do.\n\nAnd this is why oversimplifying in a threat intelligence product that any of the above actors\nshould be treated as simply “Russia is after you” is dangerous for cyber security\ndepartments/customers that have to develop defensive controls to protect their assets.\n\nIf you are unsure about the attribution it’s better to stay away from attributing it at all until\nyou have sufficient evidence, and focus on the lower level indicators and warnings that you\ncan share to help defenders take some action. For example, what did you observe in terms\nof TTPs or even IOCs. It’s better to share high confidence intelligence than “it’s the\nRussians” that has zero practical application to develop protections without more context that\ncan help in understanding the motivations and intentions.\n\nThe same applies if you are a briefer delivering those threat intelligence products, choose\nyour words wisely. Finally, do not forget that some of those agencies collaborate on certain\nprojects including sharing some software tools, libraries and TTPs (typically through lessonslearned sessions and internal policies).\n\nHopefully that clears it out…\n\n\n-----\n\nWritten by xorl\n\nJanuary 25, 2021 at 10:59\n\n[Posted in threat intelligence](https://xorl.wordpress.com/category/threat-intelligence/)\n\n## Leave a Reply\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.
