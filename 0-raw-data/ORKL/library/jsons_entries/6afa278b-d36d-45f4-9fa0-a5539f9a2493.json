exploitation\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/critical-wordpress-plugin-zero-day-under-active-exploitation/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/critical-wordpress-plugin-zero-day-under-active-exploitation/)**\n\nSergiu Gatlan\n\nBy\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nJune 1, 2021\n01:25 PM\n0\n\nThreat actors are scanning for sites running the Fancy Product Designer plugin to exploit a\nzero-day bug allowing them to upload malware.\n\n[Fancy Product Designer is a visual product configurator plugin for WordPress,](https://fancyproductdesigner.com/)\nWooCommerce, and Shopify, and it allows customers to customize products using their own\ngraphics and content.\n\nAccording to sales statistics for the plugin, Fancy Product Designer has been sold and\ninstalled on more than 17,000 websites.\n\n## Zero-day also impacts WooCommerce sites\n\n\n-----\n\nZero-days are publicly disclosed vulnerabilities vendors haven t patched, which, in some\ncases, are also actively exploited in the wild or have publicly available proof-of-concept\nexploits.\n\n[The security flaw is a critical severity remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability discovered](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)\nby [Wordfence security analyst Charles Sweethill on Monday.](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/06/critical-0-day-in-fancy-product-designer-under-active-attack/)\n\n\"The WordPress version of the plugin is the one used in WooCommerce installations as well\nand is vulnerable,\" threat analyst Ram Gall told BleepingComputer.\n\nWhen it comes to the plugin's Shopify version, attacks would likely be blocked, given that\nShopify uses stricter access controls for sites hosted and running on its platform.\n\n## Vulnerable sites exposed to complete takeover\n\nAttackers who successfully exploit the Fancy Product Designer bug can bypass built-in\nchecks blocking malicious files uploading to deploy executable PHP files on sites where the\nplugin is installed.\n\nThis allows the threat actors to completely take over vulnerable sites following remote code\nexecution attacks.\n\n\"This attacker appears to be targeting e-commerce sites and attempting to extract order\n[information from site databases,\" Gall said.](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/06/critical-0-day-in-fancy-product-designer-under-active-attack/)\n\n\"As this order information contains personally identifiable information from customers, site\nowners are in a particularly difficult position if they are still running vulnerable versions of this\nplugin as it risks the e-commerce merchant’s PCI-DSS compliance.\n\n\"Due to this vulnerability being actively attacked, we are publicly disclosing with minimal\ndetails even though it has not yet been patched in order to alert the community to take\nprecautions to keep their sites protected.\"\n\nWhile the vulnerability has only been exploited on a small scale, the attacks targeting the\nthousands of sites running the Fancy Product Designer plugin have started more than four\nmonths ago, on January 30, 2021.\n\n## Security update available\n\nSince the vulnerability is under active exploitation and was rated as critical severity,\ncustomers are advised to immediately install the Fancy Product Designer 4.6.9 patched\nversion released on June 2.\n\n\n-----\n\nWordFence is still holding off on releasing additional details about this vulnerability until more\nsites running Fancy Product Designer update to the latest version given that the zero-day\ncan be exploited \"in some configurations\" even after deactivation/\n\nDetailed info on how to update the plugin (which doesn't come with an automatic update\nmechanism) and indicators of compromise, including IP addresses used to launch these\n[ongoing attacks, are available in the WordFence report.](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/06/critical-0-day-in-fancy-product-designer-under-active-attack/)\n\nThe Fancy Product Designer development team did not reply to BleepingComputer's request\nfor comment before the article was published.\n\n_Update: Added info on patched version released on June 2, 2021._\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers target Tatsu WordPress plugin in
