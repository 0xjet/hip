    "plain_text": "# Large botnet cause of recent Tor network overload\n\n**[blog.fox-it.com/2013/09/05/large-botnet-cause-of-recent-tor-network-overload/](https://blog.fox-it.com/2013/09/05/large-botnet-cause-of-recent-tor-network-overload/)**\n\nSeptember 5, 2013\n\nRecently, [Roger Dingledine described a sudden increase in Tor users on the Tor Talk](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029582.html)\nmailinglist. To date there has been a large amount of speculation as to why this may have\nhappened. A large number of articles seem to suggest this to be the result of the recent\nglobal espionage events, the evasion of the Pirate Bay blockades using the PirateBrowser or\nthe Syrian civil war.\n\nAt the time of writing, the amount of Tor clients actually appears to have more than\nquintupled already. The graph shows no signs of a decline in growth, as seen below:\n\nAn alternative recurring explanation is the increased usage of botnets using Tor, based on\nthe assertion that the increase appears to consist of mostly new users to Tor that apparently\nare not doing much given the limited impact on Tor exit performance. In recent days, we\nhave indeed found evidence which suggests that a specific and rather unknown botnet is\nresponsible for the majority of the sudden uptick in Tor users. A recent detection name that\nhas been used in relation to this botnet is “Mevade.A”, but older references suggest the\nname “Sefnit”, which dates back to at least 2009 and also included Tor connectivity. We have\nfound various references that the malware is internally known as SBC to its operators.\n\n\n-----\n\nPreviously, the botnet communicated mainly using HTTP as well as alternative\ncommunication methods. More recently and coinciding with the uptick in Tor users, the\nbotnet switched to Tor as its method of communication for its command and control channel.\nThe botnet appears to be massive in size as well as very widespread. Even prior to the\nswitch to Tor, it consisted of tens of thousands of confirmed infections within a limited amount\nof networks. When these numbers are extrapolated on a per country and global scale, these\nare definitely in the same ballpark as the Tor user increase.\n\nThus one important thing to note is that this was an already existing botnet of massive scale,\neven prior to the conversion to using Tor and .onion as command and control channel.\n\n[As pointed out in the Tor weekly news, the version of Tor that is used by the new Tor clients](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-weekly-news-%E2%80%94-september-4th-2013)\nmust be 0.2.3.x, due to the fact that they do not use the new Tor handshake method. Based\non the code we can confirm that the version of Tor that is used is 0.2.3.25.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware uses command and control connectivity via Tor .onion links using HTTP. While\nsome bots continue to operate using the standard HTTP connectivity, some versions of the\nmalware use a peer-to-peer network to communicate (KAD based).\n\nTypically, it is fairly clear what the purpose of malware is, such as banking, clickfraud,\nransomware or fake anti-virus malware. In this case however it is a bit more difficult. It is\npossible that the purpose of this malware network is to load additional malware onto the\nsystem and that the infected systems are for sale. We have however no compelling evidence\nthat this is true, so this assumption is merely based on a combination of small hints. It does\nhowever originate from a Russian spoken region, and is likely motivated by direct or indirect\nfinancial related crime.\n\nThis specific version of the malware, which includes the Tor functionality, will install itself in:\n```\n%SYSTEM%\\config\\systemprofile\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\Windows Internet Name\nSystem\\wins.exe\n\n```\nAdditionally, it will install a Tor component in:\n```\n%PROGRAMFILES%\\Tor\\Tor.exe\n\n```\nA live copy for researchers of the malware can be found at:\n```\nhxxp://olivasonny .no-ip .biz /attachments/tc.c1\n\n```\nThis location is regularly updated with new versions.\n\nRelated md5 hashes:\n```\n2eee286587f76a09f34f345fd4e00113 (August 2013)\nc11c83a7d9e7fa0efaf90cebd49fbd0b (September 2013)\n\n```\nRelated md5 hashes from non-Tor version:\n```\n4841b5508e43d1797f31b6cdb83956a3 (December 2012)\n4773a00879134a9365e127e2989f4844 (January 2013)\n9fcddc45ae35d5cdc06e8666d249d250 (February 2013)\nb939f6ef3bd292996f97aa5786757870 (March 2013)\n47c8b85a4c82ed71487deab68de196ba (March 2013)\n3e6eb9f8d81161db44b4c4b17763c46a (April 2013)\na0343241bf53576d18e9c1329e6a5e7e (April 2013)\n\n```\nThank you to our partners for the help in investigating this threat.\n\nProtACT Team & InTELL Team\n\n\n-----",
