    "plain_text": "|Type your keyword...|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n\n**On December 23, 2015, around half of the homes in the Ivano-Frankivsk region in Ukraine (populationrd**\n**around 1.4 million) were left without electricity for a few hours. According to the Ukrainian news media**\n**outlet TSN, the cause of the power outage was a “hacker attack” utilizing a “virus”.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Furthermore, we found out that the attackers have been using a malware family on which we have had our**\n**eye for quite some time now: BlackEnergy. Specifically, the BlackEnergy backdoor has been used to plant�**\n**a KillDisk component onto the targeted computers that would render them unbootable.**\n\n## (Un)related events?\n\n**The BlackEnergy trojan has been used for various purposes in the past few years. At the Virus Bulletin**\n**[conference in 2014, we discussed a series of cyber-espionage attacks against high-value, government-](https://www.virusbtn.com/conference/vb2014/abstracts/LM3-LipovskyCherepanov.xml)**\n**related targets in Ukraine. The malware operators have used numerous spreading mechanisms to infect**\n**[their victims, including the infamous PowerPoint 0-day CVE-2014-4114. While the primary objectives of the](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/10/14/cve-2014-4114-details-august-blackenergy-powerpoint-campaigns/)**\n**2014 attacks appeared to be espionage, the discovery of BlackEnergy trojan-droppers capable of infecting**\n**SCADA Industrial Control Systems hinted that the gang might be up to something more dramatic.**\n\n**In the recent attacks against electricity distribution companies in Ukraine, a destructive KillDisk trojan was**\n**downloaded and executed on systems previously infected with the BlackEnergy trojan.**\n\n**[The link between BlackEnergy and KillDisk was first reported by CERT-UA� in November. In that instance, a](http://cert.gov.ua/?p=2370)**\n**number of news media companies were attacked at the time of the 2015 Ukrainian local elections. The**\n**report claims that a large number of video materials and various documents have been destroyed as a**\n**result of the attack.**\n\n## Electricity distribution companies under attack\n\n**Currently we know of several electricity distribution companies in Ukraine (other than the** **[medialized case](http://ru.tsn.ua/ukrayina/iz-za-hakerskoy-ataki-obestochilo-polovinu-ivano-frankovskoy-oblasti-550406.html)**\n**[of Prykarpattya Oblenergo, already picked up by the media) that have been targeted by cybercriminals. We](http://www.oe.if.ua/showarticle.php?id=3413)**\n**can confirm that the BlackEnergy backdoor was used against some of them and that the destructive�**\n**KillDisk component was also used in more recent cases observed during the week of Christmas Eve, 2015.**\n**Additionally, BlackEnergy was also detected at electricity companies earlier in 2015; while we have no**\n**indication of KillDisk being used at that time, it is possible that the cybercriminals were then at the**\n**preparatory stage of the attack.**\n\n**The infection vector used in these attacks is Microsoft Office files containing malicious macros. We have�**\n**[observed the BlackEnergy gang using this common technique, also employed by Dridex and other gangs,](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/11/24/new-dridex-campaign-achieves-high-infection-ratio-european-countries/)**\n**throughout 2015.**\n\n**The attack scenario is simple: the target gets a spear-phishing email that contains an attachment with a**\n**[malicious document. The Ukrainian security company CyS Centrum published two screenshots of emails](https://cys-centrum.com/ru/news/uisgcon11_2015#pic-5)**\n**used in BlackEnergy campaigns, where the attackers spoofed the sender address to appear to be one**\n**belonging to Rada (the Ukrainian parliament). The document itself contains text trying to convince the**\n**victim to run the macro in the document. This is an example where social engineering is used instead of**\n**exploiting software vulnerabilities. If victims are successfully tricked, they end up infected with BlackEnergy**\n**Lite.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[As explained in our Virus Bulletin talk, the BlackEnergy trojan is modular and employs various](https://www.virusbtn.com/conference/vb2014/abstracts/LM3-LipovskyCherepanov.xml)**\n**downloadable components to carry out specific tasks. In the case of the most recent attack in Ukraine, the�**\n**Win32/KillDisk malware was found on the infected system.**\n\n**As well as being able to delete system files to make the system unbootable – functionality typical for such�**\n**destructive trojans – the KillDisk variant detected in the electricity distribution companies also appears to**\n**contain some additional functionality specifically intended to sabotage industrial systems.�**\n\n**Firstly, it was possible to set a specific time delay after which the destructive payload was activated. Then,�**\n**apart from the regular KillDisk functionality, it would try to terminate two non-standard processes:**\n**komut.exe and sec_service.exe. The second process, sec_service.exe, may belong to software called**\n**ELTIMA Serial to Ethernet Connector or to ASEM Ubiquity, a platform commonly used in Industrial Control**\n**Systems (ICS). If this process is found on the target system, the trojan will not only terminate it but will also**\n**overwrite its corresponding executable file on the hard drive with random data in order to make restoration�**\n**of the system more difficult.�**\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Destructive malware is not a new phenomenon. While even some of the earliest viruses used to have**\n**destructive functionality intended mostly as a prank, today’s cybercriminals use such components for a**\n**number of reasons, ranging from sabotage, or hacktivism, to covering their tracks after a successful cyber-**\n**[espionage attack. The Flamer (a.k.a. Flame or sKyWIper) malware](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2012/05/29/flamer-the-21st-century-whale/)** **is one of the most notorious examples. A**\n**[data-wiping component has, reportedly, also been used in the attack against Sony Pictures. It should be](http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/12/inside-the-wiper-malware-that-brought-sony-pictures-to-its-knees/)**\n**clear, though, that a trojan capable of ‘wiping’ files or a few sectors of a hard-drive is not exactly unique�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**unrelated incidents are bound to happen.**\n\n**Even the BlackEnergy malware family has used a dstr destructive plugin in 2014. However, unlike the**\n**recent KillDisk variants used in attacks against media companies and the electricity distribution industry, it**\n**appeared as a generic ‘self-destruct’ component and we are not sure of its intended purpose.**\n\n**Our analysis of the destructive KillDisk malware detected in several electricity distribution companies in**\n**Ukraine indicates that it is theoretically capable of shutting down critical systems. However, there is also**\n**[another possible explanation. The BlackEnergy backdoor, as well as a recently discovered SSH backdoor,](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/03/blackenergy-sshbeardoor-details-2015-attacks-ukrainian-news-media-electric-industry/)**\n**themselves provide attackers with remote access to infected systems. After having successfully infiltrated�**\n**a critical system with either of these trojans, an attacker would, again theoretically, be perfectly capable of**\n**shutting it down. In such case, the planted KillDisk destructive trojan would act as a means of making**\n**recovery more difficult.�**\n\n**We can assume with a fairly high amount of certainty that the described toolset was used to cause the**\n**power outage in the Ivano-Frankivsk region.**\n\n**Although in Ukraine, Christmas is traditionally not celebrated on December 24** **th and 25, a group ofth**\n**cybercriminals has chosen this time of year to deliver a dark ‘present’ to a few hundred thousand people**\n**and many more might have also been this ‘lucky’, had the malware not been detected.**\n\n**_[For further information on the situation, thoughts and takeaways, read this post on the SANS Industrial](https://ics.sans.org/blog/2016/01/01/potential-sample-of-malware-from-the-ukrainian-cyber-attack-uncovered)_**\n**_Control Systems Security Blog.
