The knowledge of these attackers, their nature, their motivations, their tools and their operating methods served as a basis for the construction of this Atlas. This work, which comes from both geographical and secto- ral angles, offers several com- plementary reading grids. Our analysis shows a breakdown into fourteen sectors of acti- vity, allying the most traditional sectors (transportation, energy, education and research, tele- communications, health, go- vernment, legal, finance, ma- nufacturing, retail) to innovative industries (automotive, space, maritime, aviation) which by the strategic nature of their acti- vity are of interest to advanced threat actors. Thales uses directly this infor- mation to feed its Cybels offer of tools and services and provi- de high added value actions to ensure a better protection for everyone.  Understanding the geostrategic frameworks as well as main tar- geted sectors threats is key to the relevance of Cyber detection and protection. Combined, they provide much better understan- ding state of the threat. I am sure that you will be able to make good use of this book for your detection and protec- tion needs and I wish you a good read and regular browsing on http://cyberthreat.thalesgroup. com/ for live updates!\n\n\n###### yber threats no longer have borders and we are now facing increa Csingly organized and interna tional groups. The networks of attackers have professionalized and today target government organizations such as large companies or even the smallest ones. In recent years, recent health and geopolitical crises have fur- ther increased the tensions of the Cyber World and we now ob- serve attacks targeting all sec- tors of activity whether for lu- crative purpose as ransomware attacks, espionage or even, data theft. The first weapon in the face of this threat is to be able to un- derstand our opponents, their techniques, tactics and proce- dures of attackers in order to ensure to protect the critical as- sets of our clients and govern- ment partners. As the European leader in cy- ber security and the worldwide leader in data protection, Thales addresses the entire informa- tion security lifecycle, the cor- nerstone of digital trust.

Capitalising on our teams world- wide, with more than 11 consul- tancy teams and 6 Security Operation Centres, we can le- verage our international threats expertise to ensure cyber pro- tection to our customers from space to the ground and from information systems to opera- tional technologies. Our Cyber Threat Intelligence expert team is screening on a daily basis a rich database and multiple cyber threat sources around the world, which we have been monitoring for seve- ral decades in order to ensure actionable strategies for critical companies or governments. It relies among other things, on collaboration and transparency between organizations to ensure the right sharing of information. Today, we want to provide as many expertise and solutions as possible for a cybersecurity that only makes sense if it is collec- tive. It is with this objective that we wanted to broaden the scope of our Cyber Threat Atlas na- med “Cyber threat Hitmap” and provide it, for the first time, in a digital format opened to eve- ryone. Our Thales Cyber Threat Atlas will open-source to everyone a detailed knowledge of the cyber threat ecosystem by contextua- lizing the activity of attacker groups.

The European continent is a privileged territory for the de- velopment of cyber threats: the size of the attack surface (go- vernmental structures, enter- prises) provides opportunities for cybercriminals, and different motivations can come into play, as Europe is both the cradle of companies willing to pay ran- soms and a powerful symbol of the western world - justifying ideology-based attacks.\n\n\n###### Europe today is an incredibly complex geopolitical space — the result of centuries of histo- ry marked by a constant oscil- lation between strife and union. It is composed of over 40 diffe- rent countries and cultures with a great diversity of natio- nal and regional languages. Geographically, Europe com- prises a highly developed Wes- tern Europe, which has long been open to globalisation and its Atlantic interface; a Sou\n\n###### thern Europe with a Mediter- ranean culture and outlook; an Eastern Europe observing Western Europe on one side and Russia on the other; and a Northern Europe around the Baltic. Modern Europe conti- nues to reflect this history and geography. Despite these geostrategic and cultural differences, a European cooperation has been built around the European Union, the euro zone[1] and bilateral\n\n\n**_TERRITORY AND IDENTITY:**\n**THE RISK OF CYBER DESTA-**\n**BILISATION**\n\n###### One of the greatest geocy- ber risks that Europe faces is destabilisation. The purpose of Europe as a combined en- tity is to be unified in order to ensure a shared development and a place on the interna- tional stage. This can lead to attempts to weaken it from abroad. One striking example is Brexit, which has marked a profound geopolitical reconfi- guration in Europe. This shift has been exploited by threat actors to weaken political en- tities such as the European Union and the United King- dom itself.\n\n**_BREXIT EXPLOITED AS A**\n**WAY TO TARGET GOVERN-**\n**MENT AGENCIES IN THE UK**\n**AND WESTERN EUROPE**\n\n_In 2018, the ATK5 (APT28, Sofa-_\n_cy) group, known for its involve-_\n_ment on the 2016 U.S presidential_\n_election campaign and its allege-_\n_dly close ties to Russian intelli-_\n_gence, conducted a phishing sche-_\n_me targeting Western Europe and_\n\n\n**_TERRITORIES AND POLI-**\n**TICAL MODELS: RISK OF**\n**STRATEGIC INCIDENTS OF**\n**STRATEGIC INCIDENTS**\n###### Europe, as we explained ear- lier, is a geopolitical space with a diverse array of iden- tities, territories, political orientations and societies, which can lead to conflicts.\n\n**_AREAS OF INSTABILITY**\n\nUKRAINE\nOn the edge of Europe, in Ukraine,\nan armed conflict between Ukrainian government forces and Russian separatist militias has been\nongoing since 2014. It is the result\nof the annexation of Crimea by Russia, which provoked an open war in\neastern Ukraine. In 2014 and 2015,\nGermany, France, Ukraine and Russia ratified two different versions of\nthe Minsk agreements to settle the\nconflict and end the fighting in the\nindustrialized regions of Donetsk\nand Luhansk. These agreements\nwere never implemented and the\nconflict was prolonged, taking the\nform of a trench war along the\nfront line.

Most importantly, this at-_\n_tack displays the ability of attacker_\n_groups to leverage sensitive political_\n_issues and turn them into potential_\n_attack vectors. Zebrocy acted as a_\n_first-stage backdoor and was used_\n_to perform system reconnaissance,_\n_create or modify files, execute com-_\n_mands, take screenshots and create_\n_Windows scheduled tasks[2]._\n\n**_PLAYING ON THE WEST’S**\n**FEARS: THE EXAMPLE OF**\n**THE ATTACK ON TV5MONDE**\n\n_Some attacks also take advantage_\n_of internal crisis in certain countries_\n_to destabilise public opinion.

A hacker group calling it-_\n_self the Cyber Caliphate, linked to_\n_so-called Islamic State, first claimed_\n_responsibility. To shed light on the_\n_attack and identify the real perpetra-_\n_tors, TV5Monde called in technical_\n_experts from ANSSI, France’s natio-_\n_nal agency for information system_\n_security, who restored service and_\n_conducted a forensic investigation_\n_to search for clues. As their inves-_\n_tigation progressed, suspicions be-_\n_gan to point to ATK5 (APT28). The_\n_evidence gathered by the experts_\n_looked similar to a modus operandi_\n_already used by the group. As reflec-_\n_ted in this attack, it should be noted_\n_that groups such as ATK5 (APT28)_\n_use visceral issues of contention_\n_between or within European coun-_\n_tries to destabilise and weaken_\n_them[3]. Interestingly enough, the_\n_main destabilising agent is not_\n_the attacks itself but rather its er-_\n\n\n_close to ISIS, creating an alliance of_\n_circumstance between an ideologi-_\n_cal opponent wishing to undermine_\n_European influence and a civilizatio-_\n_nal adversary who uses the claim to_\n_instil fear within the population._\n\n**_TERRITORY AND DEVELOP-**\n**MENT: CYBERCRIME RISK**\n**AND INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE**\n\n###### Europe has many large cor- porations and SMEs (Small to medium-sized enterprises) that are interdependent at continental level. They are also part of the global eco- nomy. This European finan- cial, industrial and innovation ecosystem inevitably attracts the attention of large cyber- criminal groups as well as actors motivated by indus- trial espionage.\n\n**_THE ERA OF CYBER-EXTOR-**\n**TION AND THE RISK OF GLO-**\n**BAL SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS**\n\n_On 30 January 2020, French contrac-_\n_tor Bouygues Construction was the_\n_victim of an attack claimed by the_\n_group of attackers behind the Maze_\n_ransomware[4]. The operators de-_\n_manded a ransom of €10 million from_\n_the French group in exchange for a_\n_decryption key and the guarantee that_\n_its sensitive data would not be leaked._\n_On 21 October 2020, Sopra Steria_\n_announced that it had fallen victim_\n_to the Ryuk ransomware[5]. A month_\n_later, in November 2020, Italy-based_\n_international energy group Enel an-_\n_nounced that it had become the vic-_\n_tim of the Netwalker ransomware and_\n_that its operators were demanding a_\n_payment of some €14 million[6]. Most_\n_European companies are closely inte-_\n_grated into the market economy and_\n_are therefore especially vulnerable_\n_to supply chain attacks. During the_\n_REvil ransomware attack on IT ma-_\n_nagement software company Kaseya_\n_in July 2021, over 1,000 other orga-_\n_nizations were impacted, mostly in_\n_Europe[7]. Swedish supermarket fran-_\n_chise Coop had to close 800 stores_\n_because they were unable to use their_\n_cash registers[8]. This supply chain at-_\n_tack culminated in a record ransom_\n_d_ _d_ _f $70_ _illi_ _i_ _t_ _f_\n\n\n**_AIRBUS VICTIM OF INDUS-**\n**TRIAL ESPIONAGE AND THE**\n**RISK OF GLOBAL ATTACKS**\n**VIA THE SUPPLY CHAIN**\n\n_Supply chain attacks on European_\n_industrial or financial groups are not_\n_only motivated by financial gain but_\n_also by technological catch-up. As a_\n_result, industrial espionage against_\n_major European corporations is now_\n_a significant threat. In 2019, Airbus_\n_was hit by a supply chain attack de-_\n_signed to steal information about the_\n_A350 airliner and the A400M milita-_\n_ry transport plane[9]. The attack was_\n_initially attributed to the Chinese_\n_hacker group ATK41 (APT10), then_\n_to the ATK146 group (Avivore)[10]. It_\n_should be noted that it is difficult to_\n_determine the exact origin of this_\n_attack, mainly because Chinese es-_\n_pionage groups tend to share their_\n_infrastructure and attack tools. This_\n_sophisticated attack demonstrated_\n_the strategic adaptability of certain_\n_groups and the advanced threat_\n_posed by supply chain attacks. For_\n_the attackers, the impossibility of a_\n_frontal attack on the Airbus group_\n_was circumvented by compromising_\n_suppliers of the aircraft manufactu-_\n_rer such as Rolls-Royce or Expleo,_\n_laying the ground for actors with ba-_\n_sic capabilities to attack high value_\n_targets[11]_\n\n\n_Fake Brexit-related document contai-_ _now know that this attack was car-_\n\n\n**FEARS: THE EXAMPLE OF**\n\n\n**RISK OF GLOBAL ATTACKS**\n\n\n**WAY TO TARGET GOVERN-**\n\n\n**_BREXIT EXPLOITED AS A**\n\n\n-----\n\n**French regions that largely contribute to European demographic growth**\n\n**Number of inhabitants in 2015**\nIn thousands, per NUTS2*\n\n700 350\n6 000\n12 000\n\n*European division corresponding\nto the former regions in France\n\n**Evolution of European regional**\n**population between 2011 and 2015**\nIn %, per NUTS2*\n\nSuperior to 1,0\n\n0,5 to 1,0\n\n0 to 0,5 UE Value : 0,20%\n\n-0,5 to 0\n\nBelow -0,5\n\nDatas not available\n\nSources : Eurostat, 2015; Gisco, 2015\n\n\nRussia’s access route to the Baltic\nSea.

In this large-scale_\n_campaign, one of the malwares used_\n_was none other than BlackEnergy_\n_from the ATK14 group (BlackEnergy)._\n_As a result of these significant and_\n_destructive attacks, NATO decided_\n_to set up its Cooperative Cyber De-_\n_fence Centre of Excellence, which is_\n_based in Estonia._\n\n**_A POWER SPACE AT RISK**\n**FROM STRATEGIC ESPIONAGE**\n\nIn addition to these attacks, which\nare exceptional in terms of their\nconsequences, European countries\nare regularly under threat from\nstrategic espionage campaigns by\nforeign groups.\n\nCONTINUOUS ESPIONAGE\n_In November 2019, ANSSI, France’s_\n_national agency for information sys-_\n_tem security, reported cyberattacks_\n_against service providers and design_\n_offices. The hackers used the PlugX_\n_malware to infiltrate their systems,_\n_steal data and, almost certainly, ac-_\n_cess the networks of their clients. In_\n_July 2021, it was discovered that the_\n_Pegasus spyware was being used_\n_on a massive scale — a reminder_\n_of the strategic nature of certain_\n\n\n350\n\nUE Value : 0,20%\n\n\n**FROM STRATEGIC ESPIONAGE**\n\n\n**ESTONIA**\n\n\n**_CYBERATTACKS AGAINST**\n**UKRAINE AMID TENSIONS**\n**WITH RUSSIA**\n\nThe ongoing armed conflict\nbetween the Ukrainian military and\npro-Russian troops has sparked an\nintense cyber activity in the region,\ntargeting especially the Ukrainian\nterritory.\nThe ATK14 hacker group (BlackEnergy) has long been known for\ntargeting companies in Europe’s\nenergy sector. Starting in early\n2015, the group infiltrated a large\nnumber of Ukrainian electricity distribution companies in order to install the BlackEnergy malware and\naccess their OT/SCADA infrastructure. On 23 December 2015, hackers successfully compromised the\nSCADA systems of three Ukrainian energy companies and shut\ndown their substations. They used\nthe KillDisk plugin to destroy files\non workstations. The group also\nlaunched a more conventional\nDDoS attack on the call centres of\nthe three companies to make them\nunavailable to customers. The attack left about 230,000 people without power for nearly six hours in\n\n\nzation of the Ukrainian government\nas well as the loss of confidence\nof the Ukrainian population towards its institutions seem to be the\nobjectives pursued.\n\nWESTERN BALKANS\nThe Western Balkan is a region\ncomposed of several eastern European countries, namely Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo,\nNorthern Macedonia, Montenegro,\nSerbia and Slovenia. In this region,\nwhere ethnic and religious tensions\nstill exist between Kosovo and Serbia, and within Bosnia-Herzegovina\nitself, the European Union is trying\nto bring political stability through\nagreements pending eventual integration[14]. The issue remains complex because Russia also exerts an\ninfluence in the region, which can\nexacerbate geopolitical destabilisation and lead to cyberattacks.\n\nBALTIC STATES\nThe Baltic states are a region where\nthe homogenisation four dimensions — identity, society, politics\nand territory — is proving difficult.\nThese countries, which declared\nindependence in 1990 after the\ncollapse of the Soviet Union, quickly sought to distance themselves\nfrom Russia’s sphere of influence\nby refusing to be integrated into\nthe Commonwealth of Independent\nStates (CIS) and instead joining the\nEU and NATO in 2004. Since the\n2016 Warsaw Summit., they have\nbenefited from NATO airspace and\non the ground protection. While the\nregion may seem well protected, it\nremains surrounded by Russian influence to the east and south (Kaliningrad enclave and Russian forces\nin Belarus) and lies in part alongside\n\n\n_types of cyberattacks. More recent-_\n_ly, in September 2021, the German_\n_authorities announced that German_\n_politicians had been spied on in the_\n_run-up to the federal elections by_\n_the Ghostwriter gang, an APT group_\n_known for its alleged close ties with_\n_Russian military service GRU. This_\n_is not the first time Germany has_\n_been at the center of an espio-_\n_nage-motivated attack campaign,_\n_as between 2017 and 2018 its go-_\n_vernment agencies were reportedly_\n_targeted by ATK56 (APT28), ano-_\n_ther group linked to Russia. During_\n_this incident, the hackers managed_\n_to gain access to the network of_\n_several German ministries (foreign_\n_affairs, defence) as well as the Ger-_\n_man’s Chancellery and the Federal_\n_Court of Auditors. German inte-_\n_rests are also closely scrutinized by_\n_other countries, most notably Iran_\n_and China. The activity of Iranian_\n_attack groups on German targets_\n_has intensified recently with the_\n_rise of tensions in the Gulf and the_\n_maintenance of financial sanctions._\n_A report by the Dutch intelligence_\n_services even pointed to the Iranian_\n_strategy of using cyber espionage_\n_as a tool in the quest to acquire_\n_European military technology. This_\n_strategy even extends to the poli-_\n_tical domain with the surveillance_\n_of its expatriate population in the_\n_Netherlands and the monitoring of_\n_the criticism addressed to the Ira-_\n_nian regime[16]._\n\n\n**_MASSIVE CYBERATTACKS IN**\n\n\nKiev oblasts (regions). This attack\nis one of the first cases of cyber sabotage directed at a power grid and\ndemonstrates the determination\nand skill of the attackers. It is still\nnot known whether the malware\ncaused the power outage, or simply\nallowed its operators to do it manually.\nOn June 2017, a major cyberattack hit Ukrainian companies. The\nmalware used is a new version of\nPetya, a family of ransomware uncovered in 2016, which had been infecting Windows-based systems. This\nattack dubbed NotPetya, initially\ntargeting Ukrainian infrastructures\nspread globally and is still considered as one of the most destructive\ncyberattack ever achieved. The attackers leveraged the EternalBlue\nvulnerability and used unpatched\ncomputers to propagate across entire networks. The UK government,\nthrough its National Cyber Security\nCentre asserted with a high degree\nof confidence that the Russian military had carried out the NotPetya\ncyberattack, whose objective was to\ndisrupt energy companies and government institutions in Ukraine13.\nThe estimated cost for the global\n\n\n**_A POWER SPACE AT RISK**\n\n\nOn the night of January 13-14,\n2022, a cyberattack named “Operation Bleeding Bear” affected several Ukrainian government sites,\nrendering the computer structure\nof state-owned sites temporarily\ninoperable. This low-complexity attack consisted of the defacement\nof the targeted sites with the replacement of the homepage with a\npropaganda message in Ukrainian.\nIt seems that the attacker exploited\na known vulnerability in a content\nmanagement system (CMS). Besides, a dozen of systems (Windows\nand Linux) were also destroyed by\na wiper malware. This attack comes in a context of escalating tensions due to the failure of negotiations and the massive presence of\npro-Russian forces stationed at the\nborder. If Ukraine points the finger\nat the group of hackers known as\nUNC1151, affiliated with the Belarusian secret service, the low level of\ntechnicality of the attacker opens\nup a wide range of possibilities in\nterms of its origin, from individual\nhackers to state-sponsored groups.\nThis attack is indicative of the use\nof non-traditional fields including\ncyber in the pursuit of political ob\n\n**_CYBERATTACKS AGAINST**\n\n\n**WITH RUSSIA**\n\n\n###### Conclusion\n\n As we have seen, Europe is a complex geopolitical space where multiple spheres of power and various models are at play, chief among them the European Union, NATO and Russia. These models sometimes clash, leading to crises that are conducive to the emergence of cyberthreats — as in Ukraine,\n\n\n**UKRAINE AMID TENSIONS**\n\n\n###### the Baltic countries and the Western Balkans. Europe is the product of perma- nent oscillation between unity and plurality of identities, with political aspirations that can provoke societal, economic, po- litical and territorial crises, and that can be utilised as levers of destabilisation by cyberattacker groups.\n\n\n###### Europe is also highly integrated into the globalisation process, with industrial and financial champions, but also thanks to a myriad of SMEs, which are permanent targets of organised cybercrime and even industrial espionage.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 12 ATKS (Attackers)\n**targeted European countries**\n\n\n###### _Adversary Type\n\n _Terrorists _State-Sponsored _Cyber Criminal\n\n\n###### 1\n\n 3 20\n _Adversary type\n\n _Energy\n\n _Manufacturing\n\n _Communication\n\n _Transportation\n\n _Education\n\n _Aviation\n\n\n###### _Top 3 attacked sectors\n\n Energy Transportation Manufacturing\n\n\n###### Commonwealth  of Independent States_\n\nArmenia\nAzerbaijan\nBelarus\nGeorgia\nKazakhstan\nKyrgyzstan\nMoldova\nRussia\nTajikistan\nTurkmenistan\nUzbekistan\n\n\n-----\n\n**_CENTRAL ASIA AT THE**\n**HEART OF INTERNAL TEN-**\n**SIONS AND EXTERNAL IN-**\n**FLUENCES**\n\n**_CENTRAL ASIA, WITNESS**\n**TO RECONFIGURATIONS OF**\n**POWER UNDER CHINESE**\n**INFLUENCE**\n\nThe Central Asia region partly corresponds to historic Turkestan.\nThis region, which is as large as the\nEuropean Union, is made up of five\ncountries: Kazakhstan in the north,\nKyrgyzstan in the east, Tajikistan in\nthe southeast, Turkmenistan in the\nsouthwest and Uzbekistan, which\nis landlocked between these four\ncountries. The Great Steppe covers\nthe north and the South mainly\ncorrespond to desert regions.\nThese five countries, which became\nindependent from the Soviet Union\nin 1991, are surrounded by Russia\nto the north and west, China to the\neast and Iran to the south.\nChinese influence in the region was\nstrengthened with the launch in\nthe fall of 2013 of the «Silk Road\nEconomic Belt.»\nIt is one of the priorities set by the\nChinese government for the years\n\n\npaign. Threat actors also conducted attacks against Armenian targets using Zero Days via Chrome\nand Internet Explorer. Azerbaijan\nwas targeted by the ATK178 and\nATK228 groups and the PoetRAT\nmalware. The targets were highly\nspecific and appeared to be mainly Azerbaijani public and private\nsector organisations, especially\nICS (Import Control System) and\nSCADA (Supervisory Control and\nData Acquisition) systems in the\nenergy sector. The number and\nvariety of tools they used indicate\nthat the attacks were carefully\nplanned. The ATK228 group’s main\nobjective was to compromise the\nwind power companies that produce Azerbaijan’s electricity. On 5\nAugust 2020, ATK5 (APT28) also\nlaunched an attack campaign using\nthe Zebrocy malware against several NATO member governments,\nMiddle Eastern governments and\nthe Azerbaijan government, which\ncooperates with NATO. This attack\ncampaign came just days after the\nclashes between Azerbaijan and\nArmenia and less than two months before the conflict began on 27\nSeptember.\n\n\n###### Contextual analysis of CIS and geocyber risks\n\n\n**_CENTRAL ASIA, WITNESS**\n\n\n**POWER UNDER CHINESE**\n\n\n###### tern Bloc, is made up of a set of complex, intertwined dynamics, a Soviet Union centred on Mos- cow and the influences of new powers in a multipolar world.

This**\n**crossroads is also strategic and**\n**lead certain nearby powers —**\n**such as the European Union (with**\n**NATO), Turkey, Iran and Russia**\n**— to assert their influence in the**\n**region**\n\n\n**_SEPARATISM, NATIONALISM**\n**AND JIHADISM IN GEORGIA**\n\nAfter the fall of the USSR, many internal conflicts broke out. In Georgia, a civil war (1991-1993) pitted\nthe secessionist provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia against\nthe central government in Tbilisi[1].\nGeographically, the Caucasus\nextends into Russian territory,\nwith the North Caucasus. It was in\nthe North Caucasus that the First\nChechen War erupted in 1994.\nThis conflict — as in Abkhazia and\nSouth Ossetia — was the scene\nof confrontation between independence movements and a former\nSoviet republic, in this case Russia.\n\nThe regional consequences of the\nRusso-Chechen conflicts are significant and make terrorism even\nmore entrenched. For example, the\nPankisi Gorge crisis from 2002\nto 2003 saw Georgia clash with\nChechen rebels and members of\nAl-Qaeda.\nThe 2000’s were also marked by\nthe appearance of colour revolutions in former Soviet republics,\nin Georgia in 2003 (Rose Revolution), in Ukraine in 2004 (Orange\nRevolution) and in Belarus in 2005\n\n\nby popular, peaceful demonstrations, these revolutions highlight\nthe confrontation between Western influence and Russia’s desire\nto control its near abroad. The democratic aspirations of the people\nand the spectre of the emergence\nof pro-Western civil societies in\nthe region motivate Russian interference, particularly through disinformation campaigns as a part of a\nmore global hybrid warfare strategy.\n\nIn 2008, a war broke out between\nGeorgia and South Ossetia, supported by Russia, Abkhazia and the\nCIS armed forces. This conflict,\nwhich Georgia lost, allowed to leave\nthe CIS. This conflict signals the\nresurgence of Moscow’s influence,\nwhich is posing as the protector of\nsecessions.\n_In 2007 and 2008, around the time_\n_of the Russo-Georgian War and the_\n_widespread attacks in Estonia, the_\n_ATK5 group (APT28) really began_\n_to structure its attack campaigns._\n_From 2007 to 2014, ATK5 (APT28)_\n_massively targeted Georgian go-_\n_vernment agencies, including the_\n_Ministry of the Interior and Ministry_\n_of Defence, as well as civilians. The_\n_ATK14 group (BlackEnergy) also_\n\n\n_against Georgia and later began to_\n_target Estonia as well. The source_\n_code of the malware was sold at that_\n_time, which increased the number_\n_of attacks on Georgia. From 2011 to_\n_2013, another ATK14 malware called_\n_Potao was used to target Armenia_\n_and Georgia. In late 2013, it began to_\n_be deployed in Ukraine, with several_\n_samples used to target this country._\n_From September 2014, the victims_\n_of this malware included Ukrainian_\n_government agencies and the armed_\n_forces._\n_In spring 2010, the ATK7 group_\n_(APT10) conducted actions across_\n_the entire Caucasus and Central_\n_Asia, with continued campaigns_\n_using PinchDuke against Turkey and_\n_Georgia as well as numerous cam-_\n_paigns against other members of_\n_the Commonwealth of Independent_\n_States, such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgy-_\n_zstan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan._\n_This same malware was identified_\n_in Chechnya in 2008. In 2015, ATK7_\n_(APT29) also targeted Georgian en-_\n_tities with the CosmicDuke malware_\n_and a file attachment with a name_\n_in Georgian that translates “NATO_\n_consolidates control of Black Sea._\n_docx”._\n\n**_CONFLICT BETWEEN ARME-**\n**NIA AND AZERBAIJAN LINKED**\n**TO THE QUESTION OF NA-**\n**GORNO-KARABAKH**\n\nThe path to the independence of\nArmenia from Azerbaijan was made\nin the throes of a war (1988-1994)\nbetween these two former Soviet\nrepublics. In 2020, a second war\nbroke out between Nagorno-Karabakh, supported by Armenia,\nand Azerbaijan and the Syrian National Army, backed by Turkey. In\nNovember 2020, a ceasefire was\njointly announced by the belligerents. Azerbaijan regained possession of the Agdam, Kalbajar and\nLachin districts. Tensions are still\nextremely high in the region and\nanimosity between Armenia and\nAzerbaijan remains significant.\nThe 2020 conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh was also the theatre of a\nlot of cyber activity. The ATK116\ngroup (Inception, Cloud Atlas) was\nactive in October and November\n2020 with an espionage campaign\nbased on use of an article entitled:\n“Armenia transfers YPG/PKK terrorists to occupied area to train\nmilitias against Azerbaijan” Both\n\n\n**_SEPARATISM, NATIONALISM**\n\n\n**_CONFLICT BETWEEN ARME-**\n\n\n**AND JIHADISM IN GEORGIA**\n\n\nBaghdad\n\n\n**TO THE QUESTION OF NA-**\n\n\n**GORNO-KARABAKH**\n\n\n-----\n\nahead. An extensive network of\ntransport, pipeline and telecommunication infrastructure will form\nthe physical skeleton of a future\nEurasian “economic corridor”. This\nnetwork will link China to Western\nEurope by land via Central Asia,\nAsia Minor, the Persian Gulf, the\nCaucasus and the Balkans. It will\nalso link them by sea via the South\nChina Sea, the Indian Ocean and\nthe Persian Gulf through to the\nMediterranean.\nThe $50 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and\nthe $40 billion Silk Road Fund were\nset up by Xi Jinping to inject investment into regional infrastructure.\nDespite the altruistic rhetoric, Beijing is responding to national priorities and serving primarily Chinese\neconomic, political and strategic\ninterests. While based on the historic aura of the ancient road that\nlinked the Chinese and Roman empires, the objectives of these “new\nsilk roads” are adapted to serve\ncontemporary geopolitical needs.\nCentral Asia is a key part of the original New Silk Roads project, which\naimed to promote the construction\nof transport infrastructure between\nChina and Europe. Xi Jinping’s\nspeech announcing the launch of\nthe Silk Road Economic Belt was\nmade in Astana (renamed Nur-Sultan on 23 March 2019), Kazakhstan.\nThe imagery of the Silk Roads is\nespecially resonant in this part of\nthe world, which was at the heart\nof the trade flows between Europe,\nthe Middle East and the Chinese\nEmpire prior to the 15th century. Of\nthe six “economic corridors” in the\nnew Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),\ntwo directly concern Central Asia:\nthe New Eurasian Land Bridge\n(China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany) and the China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor (China, Kazakhstan,\nKyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan,\nTurkmenistan, Iran, Turkey).\nIn spite of having become the first\ntrading partner for central Asia\ncountries, China’s interest in its\nneighbouring region to the west is\nnot only based on an economic vision. For the Chinese central government, helping stabilise and develop the countries on its western\nfront is a way to avoid instability at\nthe gates of its western Xinjiang region. This region, considered unstable by Beijing is mainly populated\n\n\nperation between China and Central Asia is largely centred around\nthe Uyghur question and the fight\nagainst the “three scourges” identified by the Shanghai Cooperation\nOrganisation (SCO): terrorism, separatism and religious extremism.\nIn the years ahead, Russia’s reactions to China’s growing presence\nin its historic area of influence\nwill be closely watched. For Russia, the BRI certainly comes with\nadvantages, such as investment\ncapacities that it cannot offer its\npartners and that will help improve\ninfrastructures and make trade\nwithin the EAEU more seamless.\nLaunched in 2015, it does not\nchallenge Russia’s monopoly on\npolitical-security issues in Central\nAsia — at least for now — and it\nsupports institutional recognition\nof the EAEU as a credible and legitimate regional organisation[3].\nNonetheless, China’s security presence could be strengthened in the\nmedium or long term with the expansion of Chinese economic interests in the zone, as can be seen in\nTajikistan[4].\n\n\n**_LOOKING AT THE MAJOR**\n**ATTACKERS WHO HAVE TAR-**\n**GETED THE REGION, WE**\n**QUICKLY SEE THAT THE GEO-**\n**POLITICAL CONTEXT HAS A**\n**SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE**\n**NATURE AND STRUCTURE OF**\n**THE CYBERTHREAT.**\n\n\n**QUICKLY SEE THAT THE GEO-**\n\n\n**_LOOKING AT THE MAJOR**\n\n\n**GETED THE REGION, WE**\n\n\n**Commonwealth of Independant States**\n\n\n**SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE**\n\n\n**ATTACKERS WHO HAVE TAR-**\n\n\n**THE CYBERTHREAT.**\n\n\n###### pective countries, is leading the world’s major powers to pro- ject their influence on these territories, even if it means ta- king advantage of or stirring up potential internally destabilising factors\n\n\n**NATURE AND STRUCTURE OF**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 33 ATKS (Attackers)\n**targeted European countries**\n\n\n###### _Adversary Type\n\n _Terrorists _State-Sponsored _Cyber Criminal\n\n\n###### 1\n\n 5 3 _Adversary type\n\n _Energy\n\n _Communication\n\n _Transportation\n\n _Education\n\n _Aviation\n\n _Retail\n\n\n###### _Top 3 attacked sectors\n\n Energy Education Aviation\n\n\n###### Zone Africa_\n\nAlgeria Ethiopia Niger\nAngola Gabon Nigeria\nBenin Gambia Reunion (FR)\nBotswana Ghana Rwanda\nBurkina Faso Guinea Saint Helena (UK)\nBurundi Guinea-Bissau Sao Tome & Principe\nCape Verde Kenya Senegal\nCameroon Lesotho Seychelles\nCentral African Rep.

Over\nthe same period, the number of\nInternet users rose from 4.51 million to 590.3 million, an increase of\n12,988.7% [1,2,3,4,5].\nIn 2021, Internet penetration in\nAfrica extended to 43% of the population, or almost one in two people.\nThis figure is 78 times higher than\n20 years ago. Africa today is modern and connected.\n\n**_DEMOGRAPHIC**\n**STRUCTURE**\n\n\n**Internet penetration**\n\n###### 1373,49\n\n1 400,00 45 %\n\n\n20 %\n\n15 %\n\n\n1 200,00\n\n1 000,00\n\n\n40 %\n\n35 %\n\n\n**Mobile Economy Sub-Saharan Africa**\n\n**Mobile internet users** **Sim Connection** **Operation revenues**\n\nExclunding licensed cellular iot **and investment**\n\n\n2019-2025\nCAGR: 9.7%\n\n\n800,00\n\n600,00\n\n\n###### 42,98%\n\n 590,30\n\n\n30 %\n\n25 %\n\n\n**Unique mobile subscribers**\n\n2019-2025\nCAGR: 4.3%\n\n\n2019-2025\nCAGR: 4.3%\n\n\n400,00\n\n200,00\n\n\n10 %\n\n5 %\n\n\n2025\n\n###### 614m\n\n\n2019 2025 2019 2025 2019\n\n###### 272m 475m 816m 1.05bn $44.3bn\n\n\n2019\n\n###### 477m\n\n\n2025\n\n###### $48.7bn\n\n\n0,00 0,00\n###### 2000 2010 2021\n\n\nPenetration Rate Penetration Rate Penetration Rate\n(% of population) (% of population) (% of population)\n\n45% 50% 26% 39% 77% 86%\n\n\nInternet users\n(in millions)\n\n\nAfrican Population\n(in millions)\nPenetration\n\n\n**_DEMOGRAPHIC**\n\n\nis probably still underestimated.

According to\nUnited Nations forecasts, Africa’s\nmedian age is expected to rise by\nfive years by 2050 and the population is expected to grow by almost\n1.15 billion[6].\nIn 30 years, Africa will be home to\n1.2 billion people under the age of\n25, which means that the use of\ndigital tools will continue to grow at\n\n\nan even faster rate. In addition, the\nincrease in the median age by just\nover five years, coupled with the\nincrease in per capita living standards by 2050, will also lead to a\ndiversification and increase in the\nuse of digital media.\nInevitably, the higher Internet penetration rate will spell an upsurge\nin the number of interconnections\nand, as a result, a greater vulnerability and threat surface.\nThe implication in terms of cyberthreats is directly apparent but it\n\n\n-----\n\n**_POOR VISIBILITY OF THE**\n**NUMBER OF SECURITY INCI-**\n**DENTS**\n\nThere is also a cultural issue in cybersecurity in terms of reporting\nand fixing security incidents. Some\n96%[16] of incidents are not reported\nor resolved, which means that the\nlevel of cyberthreat in Africa is likely\nto be much higher than we know.\n\n**_LEGAL AND STRATEGIC AR-**\n**MOURY UNDER CONSTRUC-**\n**TION**\n\nMost African countries have not\nyet, or have not sufficiently, structured their legal armoury to deal\nwith the cyberthreat. In 2016, it was\nestimated that over 40 countries\nacross the entire continent had not\nor had only partially implemented\nspecific legal provisions to address\nthe challenges of cybercrime and\noversee the gathering of electronic\nevidence[17]. It should also be noted\nthat only 15 African countries have\na national cybersecurity strategy in\nplace[18].\n\n\n**_POOR VISIBILITY OF THE**\n\n\n**_BY EXTENSION, GSMA ES-**\n**TIMATES THAT 615 MILLION**\n**PEOPLE IN SUB-SAHARAN**\n**AFRICA WILL HAVE SUBSCRI-**\n**BED TO MOBILE SERVICES**\n**BY 2025, WITH 64% OF THEM**\n**SMARTPHONE SUBSCRIP-**\n**TIONS[9]. RISKS AND THREATS**\n\n###### This dual dynamic of a ra- pidly expanding vulnerability surface and the persistence of critical cybersecurity and cyberdefence issues has an impact on the level of cyber- threat observed across the African continent.\n\n**_EXAMPLE OF LIBERIA IN 2016**\n\n_In October 2016, Liberia suffered a_\n_massive DDoS (distributed denial_\n_of service) attack, which caused_\n_all banking transactions to be sus-_\n_pended for half the country[10]. Over_\n_half a million security cameras_\n_around the world simultaneously_\n_attempted to connect to the ser-_\n_vers used by Lonestar Cell MTN,[11]_\n_the country’s largest telecommu-_\n_nications company, leading to an_\n_extended service outage._\n\n**_EXAMPLE OF SOUTH AFRICA**\n**IN 2019**\n\n_In July 2019, the City of Johannes-_\n_burg fell victim to a devastating ran-_\n_somware attack[12]. The operators of_\n_the malware, the Shadow Kill Hac-_\n_kers, targeted City Power, the city’s_\n_main power company, forcing the_\n_authorities to shut down the city’s_\n_website, e-services platform and bil-_\n_ling system[13]. Electricity was also cut_\n_off for several hours in the city._\n\n**_EXAMPLE OF ETHIOPIA IN**\n**2020**\n\n_In June 2020, 13 official Ethiopian_\n_government websites were affected_\n_by a cyberattack by the Cyber_Horus_\n_Group. The hackers, whose Egyptian_\n_origin seems to be established, left_\n_several nationalist messages de-_\n\n\n_nouncing the filling of the Renais-_\n_sance Dam on the Nile, reflecting_\n_the significant geopolitical tension_\n_between Egypt and Ethiopia[14]._\n\n**_OPPORTUNITIES AND**\n**CHALLENGES**\n\n###### The contextual issue for un- derstanding the cyberthreat in Africa is not simply the ex- ponential increase in digital technology across the conti- nent. In reality, the problem also lies in the imbalance between this increase and the status of cybersecurity and cyberdefence in the so- cieties concerned.\n\n**_LACK OF CYBER EXPERTS**\n\nThis imbalance is mainly due to\nthree co-constituent factors. First,\nit is a human problem, which\ndoes not only concern the African\ncontinent. In Africa, an additional 100,000 cybersecurity experts\nare needed in order to respond to\nthe current challenges[15]. And the\ntrends we have discussed will further increase this need.\n\n\n###### Conclusion\n\n Africa is destined to become one of the geographic parts of the world where the cyber is- sue will be the most decisive factor for the future of socie- ties and organisations. Already, the continent’s colos- sal trends are fuelling a strate- gically important yet unsuspec- ted cyberthreat. These trends include the exponentially in- creasing Internet penetration across society and industry (up 12,988.7% in 20 years), the de\n\n**NUMBER OF SECURITY INCI-**\n\n\n**DENTS**\n\n\n###### mographic structure of these societies (1.2 billion people un- der 25 by 2050) and the rapidly growing popularity of digital tools. At the same time, 96% of se- curity incidents are unknown or unreported and decisive at- tacks are already affecting the continent, as we have seen in Ethiopia, South Africa and Li- beria. These trends will obviously continue to create huge issues\n\n\n###### and challenges, yet a mismatch is already apparent when we consider the structure of cy- bersecurity and cyberdefence across the continent. Three challenges need to be met, na- mely the training of the popu- lation to create cyber experts, the visibility of incidents and a clearly defined legal and strate- gic framework to address the cyberthreat.\n\n\n**_EXAMPLE OF LIBERIA IN 2016**\n\n\n**_LEGAL AND STRATEGIC AR-**\n\n\n**_EXAMPLE OF ETHIOPIA IN**\n\n\n**IN 2019**\n\n\n**TION**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 29 ATKS (Attackers)\n**targeted the aera**\n\n\n###### _Adversary Type\n\n _Terrorists _State-Sponsored _Cyber Criminal\n\n\n###### 8\n\n 5 _Adversary type 43\n\n _Energy\n\n _Manufacturing\n\n _Communication\n\n _Transportation\n\n _Education\n\n _Aviation\n\n _Information Technology\n\n _Retail\n\n\n###### _Top 3 attacked sectors\n\n Energy Education Manufacturing\n\n\n###### Zone North America _\n\nUnited States\nCanada\nMexico\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Contextual analysis of North America and geocyber risks\n\n\n**QUENCES ON THE CYBER-**\n\n\n**HAD SIGNIFICANT CONSE-**\n\n\n###### $18,036 billion, the highest in the world.

The United States is home to many of the largest multina- tional corporations and several global cities, chief among which is New York. However, such disparities and issues of hegemony can exa- cerbate international tensions, fostering an environment of heightened geopolitical cyber- threats.\n\n\n**_US FOREIGN POLICY HAVE**\n\n\n###### The Americas can be divided into three geographic regions: North America, which includes the United States, Canada and Mexico; Central America; and South America. This hemis- phere is marked by its cultural contrasts and, in particular, by its economic diversity. The United States and Canada are rich and developed, while other countries in the region are considered to be emergent or low-income economies. The Americas are beset by many geopolitical tensions taking the form of border conflicts\n\n\n###### between countries or even so- cial conflicts within them. The role of the United States, some- times described as dominant, is often cited as the cause. More accurately, dominance on the continent can be described as being shared between the United States and Canada, the region’s two most developed nations. This creates a geoe- conomic contrast on the conti- nent as a whole, as these two countries constitute one of the three major poles of the world economy. Indeed, in 2015, the GDP of the United States was\n\n\n**THREAT LANDSCAPE.**\n\n\n**_ONGOING INTERNATIONAL**\n**TENSIONS IN NORTH AMERICA**\n\n**Since the end of the Second**\n**World War – and, more to the**\n**point, since the Bretton Woods**\n**agreement in 1944 – the United**\n**States has remained at the top of**\n**the international order.**\n\n**_THE US AND CHANGING FO-**\n**REIGN POLICIES IN THE ERA**\n**OF “AMERICA FIRST”**\n\nCanada, Mexico and the rest of\nthe world have had to significantly\namend their foreign policies over\nthe last several years, under\npressure during Donald Trump’s\nterm as President of the United\nStates from 2017 to 2021.\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS OF NORTH\nAMERICAN NATIONS\nThe leaders of Canada and Mexico,\nalong with foreign ministries from\nother nations around the world,\nhave adjusted their foreign policies\neither in the US’s favour or to turn\naway from it. For example, Canadian\n\n\n2020, relations between these two\ncountries were aggravated yet further with the killing of the Iranian\nGeneral Qassem Soleimani, the Islamic Republic’s representative in\nIraq and head of the Quds Force, in\nan American raid in Baghdad on 3\nJanuary 2020. Despite an Iranian\nretaliation in the form of several\nmissile strikes on US bases in Iraq,\ntensions have begun to soften as\nthe two sides seek some level of\nstability.\n\nCHINA–US RELATIONS\nIn recent years, relations between\nChina and the United States have\nbeen beset by several geopolitical\nevents that have strained the limits of diplomacy between the two\ncountries.\nFor example, in 2020, the US accused China at length of data theft\nand widespread espionage, leading to the closure of the Chinese\nconsulate in Houston, Texas. The\nUS Secretary of State justified\nthese steps as being for the protection of US intellectual property\nand the personal information of in\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau and\nMexican President Enrique Peña\nNieto have frequently remarked on\ntheir disagreements with President\nTrump, while remaining clear that\nthey wish to continue their cooperation with the world’s leading economy.\nDuring his term, President Trump\noriented its foreign policy towards a strengthening of bilateral relationships with Russia, Iran, and\neven China.\n\nRUSSIA–US RELATIONS\nThe power balance between the\nUnited States and these three nations was a touchstone of Trump’s\ntenure, and continues to be so under Biden, albeit with less emphasis on Russia.\nOn Russia specifically, some observers of Russia–US relations, particularly pro-Kremlin Europeans,\nhave claimed that Vladimir Putin\nis an “ideal” or “useful” enemy for\nAmerica. They imply that the US\nis almost entirely responsible for\nits tense, fragile relationship with\nPutin’s Russia, or even that it be\n\nnefits from the hostility that exists\nbetween the two countries. However, the US hardly revels in the\nongoing tensions, and does not appear to profit from them, not least\nbecause as Russia grows more distant from other European countries\nand US, it is becoming increasingly\ndependent on its relations with\nChina and less inclined towards mitigating the increasing asymmetry\nbetween these powers.\n\nIRAN–US RELATIONS\nRelations between the US and Iran\nhave become yet more precarious.\nIndeed, the recent spike in tensions\nstarting in early 2019 is part of a\nbroader trend of escalating diplomatic disagreements between the\ntwo countries. Already fraught after\nthe US’s withdrawal from the Iran\nnuclear deal (JCPOA) in May 2018,\nIran–US relations have degraded\neven further, especially since the\nTrump administration added the\nRevolutionary Guards to its list of\nterrorist organisations in April 2019\nand tightened its sanctions against\nTehran the following month. In\n\n\n**_US FOREIGN POLICY HAVE**\n**HAD SIGNIFICANT CONSE-**\n**QUENCES ON THE CYBER-**\n**THREAT LANDSCAPE.**\n\n_The threat represented by Russia_\n_has been compounded by a marked_\n_increase in the number and seve-_\n_rity of attacks since 2019. In cybe-_\n_respionage, the SolarWinds attack_\n_(December_ _2020)_ _demonstrated_\n_the danger posed by attacks from_\n_state-sponsored groups. This sup-_\n_ply chain breach had a particular-_\n_ly serious impact because, rather_\n_than directly targeting the federal_\n_government or a private company’s_\n_network, the perpetrators attacked a_\n_third-party software supplier serving_\n_these entities. The target was an IT_\n_management platform called Orion,_\n_a product of Texas-based company_\n_SolarWinds. More than 33,000 bu-_\n_sinesses used Orion. According to_\n_SolarWinds, 18,000 of its clients_\n_were affected, including 425 Fortune_\n_500 companies._\n_This heightened threat is also exem-_\n_plified by the ransomware attack_\n_conducted by ATK168 using REvil,_\n_also known as Sodinokibi. The at-_\n_tack on software company Kaseya_\n_by the REvil ransomware operation_\n_is considered the largest ever such_\n_attack by a cybercriminal group._\n_While 2017’s three ransomware at-_\n_tacks (WannaCry, NotPetya and Bad_\n_Rabbit) were larger, they were lin-_\n_ked to state-sponsored actors rather_\n_than groups with financial motives._\n_According to cybersecurity resear-_\n_chers at Symantec, some vague in-_\n_dications point to political motives_\n_behind the attack. The US has not_\n_explicitly linked the REvil attacks to_\n_the Kremlin, but President Joe Bi-_\n_den has nevertheless warned his_\n_Russian counterpart that the latter’s_\n_government must act against such_\n_criminal organisations, and that US_\n_authorities would do so if necessary._\n_In January 2021, several members of_\n_REvil were arrested by Russian au-_\n_thorities obeying to a US demand._\n_While it may appear as the rein-_\n_forcement of collaboration between_\n_the two countries, the timing of this_\n_announcement raises questions as_\n\n\nalso described the Chinese consulate in Houston as having been a\nhub for espionage. Moreover, two\nChinese nationals were charged by\na US court with computer hacking\noffences for allegedly stealing data\nfrom a company working on a Covid-19 vaccine.\nHowever, the closure of the\nHouston consulate in particular\nwas all the more symbolic as it\nwas the PRC’s first in the United\nStates, having opened in 1979 with\nthe reestablishment of diplomatic\nrelations between the two powers.\nChina viewed the closure as a step\ntoo far, declaring it an outrageous,\nunjustified and unilateral provocation by the US. Beijing retaliated\nby ordering the closure of the US\nconsulate in Chengdu, in central\nChina, on 24 July 2020. In a press\nrelease, the Chinese foreign minister described this as a “legitimate\nand necessary response to the\nunreasonable measures taken by\nthe United States”.\n\n\n**REIGN POLICIES IN THE ERA**\n\n\n**OF “AMERICA FIRST”**\n\n\n-----\n\n_the first campaign debate between_\n_Biden and Trump.

The\nUS’s decision to heavily tax steel\nand aluminium imports had been\nextremely damaging to Canada and\nthe member states of the European\nUnion. The move even provoked\nthreats of retaliation from the EU,\nCanada and Mexico. In May 2018,\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin\nTrudeau publicly declared his disap\n\n_were targeted by a cyberattack and_\n_Russian troops are massed at the_\n_border._\n_Likewise, the largest oil pipeline of_\n_the US, Colonial Pipeline, fell vic-_\n_tim to the RaaS (Ransomware-as-_\n_a-Service), forcing the company to_\n_temporarily shut down its activity._\n_The incident, which happened on_\n_May 7, 2021, affected the delivery of_\n_gas in Southern states, provoking_\n_shortages at gas pumps._\n_Former US President Donald Trump_\n_was also the target of several in-_\n_fluence campaigns. These attacks_\n_appeared to originate from groups_\n_operating in China, including ATK213_\n_(also known as APT31). This group_\n_carried out more than 150 breaches_\n_over the course of six months. In_\n_2020, Trump called for the social_\n_media platform Tik Tok to be banned_\n_in the United States, on the basis_\n_that the data collected through the_\n_app was disseminated to the Chinese_\n_government. This ban provoked_\n_many Chinese actors to carry out_\n_influence campaigns aimed at des-_\n_tabilising the US elections by sowing_\n_disinformation about the President_\n_to sway voters._\n\n\n**_THREATS ARE ALSO EMER-**\n**GING FROM OUTSIDE OF**\n**CHINA.**\n\n_After months of heightened ten-_\n_sions between the US and Iran,_\n_there were fears that this could have_\n_been used as justification for an_\n_attempt to destabilise the US elec-_\n_tion. After Trump withdrew the US_\n_from the JCPoA in May 2018 and_\n_Iranian general Qassem Soleimani_\n_was killed on Iraqi soil in January_\n_2019, the risk of cyberespionage or_\n_more conventional attacks (such as_\n_phishing or ransomware campaigns)_\n_aiming to destabilise the then-US_\n_President became markedly more_\n_significant. In May and June 2020,_\n_this fear was realised in the form of_\n_an attack by the group Phospho-_\n_rus, which gained access to several_\n_accounts belonging to members of_\n_the administration, Trump campaign_\n_staff and others involved in the 2020_\n_presidential election._\n_Twitter announced that it had de-_\n_leted around 130 Iran-based ac-_\n_counts that had disrupted the public_\n_conversation on the platform during_\n\n\n**_THREATS ARE ALSO EMER-**\n\n\n**GING FROM OUTSIDE OF**\n\n\n**CHINA.**\n\n\nproval and, along with policymakers\nin European countries, claimed that\nthe President’s invocation of the\nnational security defence, referring\nto WTO regulations, did not hold\nwater.\nIt is therefore unsurprising to see\nCanada looking to the nations of\nthe Old Continent for less protectionist economic partners, more\nopen to diplomatic relations.\nThis transition took a significant\nstep forward with the signing of\nthe Comprehensive Economic and\nTrade Agreement (CETA) between\nCanada and the EU in autumn\n2016. The goal of this agreement\nwas to ease the export of Canadian\nproducts to the European market\nby almost completely eliminating\ntariff and non-tariff barriers, while\ncreating a more stable investment\ncontext for Canadian and European\nbusinesses.\nPrime Minister Trudeau and French\nPresident Emmanuel Macron portrayed this bolstered Canada–\nFrance relationship as favouring a\njust, fair and rules-based international order. Canada and France have\ninstituted structural frameworks\nfor their joint activities, particularly\nin the areas of culture, the environment, development aid, sustainable\ndevelopment, artificial intelligence\nand defence. The two countries\nhave committed to a joint meeting\nof their cabinets with the goal of\nbuilding further institutional ties.\n\n\n_Many of these disinformation cam-_\n_paigns have responded to significant_\n_events such as the January 2017_\n_massacre at a Quebec City mosque_\n_or the June 2019 approval of the_\n_Trans Mountain pipeline._\n\n**_MEXICO**\n\nAlthough Mexico is a multiparty democracy, power remains concentrated in the hands of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI),\nwhich controlled both chambers of\nCongress and the presidency continuously from the Second World\nWar until 2018.

A military junta seized power in Managua, Nicaragua’s capital, triggering a civil war that engulfed the country. The so-called Sandinis- ta revolution marked the start of more than 10 years of civil war in Latin America. Geopolitical tensions abound in the Americas, fuelled by border conflicts between countries or social conflicts within them, as well as the dominant role of the United States. Central and South America are regions beset by perennial and long-standing conflicts. In Cen- tral America, the Sandinista re\n\n###### volution against the US-backed dictatorship in Nicaragua in the 1970s marked the beginning of a decade of strife. In South America, some ten- sions are rooted in national bor- ders drawn during the post-co- lonial period. The wounds of the War of the Pacific, in which Bo- livia lost its only province with access to the sea to Chile, re- main raw for many Bolivians. The repercussions of this ani- mosity are still being felt as Bo- livia refuses to provide energy resources to Chile. Since the end of the 2000s, there have also been significant tensions between Colombia and Vene- zuela.\n\n\n###### Despite these ongoing strains, the continent is becoming more and more integrated. Human and capital flows are on the rise, albeit oriented towards the US. In North America, the USMCA (United-States, Mexico, Canada Agree has established an area where capital and goods circu- late freely. Its equivalent in the South is MERCOSUR. The region’s troubled internal relations may give rise to groups of attackers aiming to take ad- vantage of its geopolitical ins- tability and set off an explosion of cybercrime within the region and beyond.\n\n\ntions (UNASUR) is now moribund.\nIn 2018, six of its 12 members\nannounced their temporary withdrawal from the union and suspended their financial contributions\nin response to the organisation’s\ncollective inability to designate a\nnew secretary general to succeed\nthe former president of Colombia.\nThis institutional breakdown is\nthe result of these countries’ shift\ntowards nationalism and prioritisation of their own economic interests, which has aggravated regional divisions and conflicts between\ncountries.\nTheir inward turn is hardly surprising, as many of them had endured\nor continue to endure deep economic, political and social crises.\nThese situations dampen the driving force that motivates earnest\ncooperation and regional projection,\ninstead favouring policy focused on\nthe internal welfare of the nation.\n\n**_FOREIGN POWERS CAN**\n**TAKE ADVANTAGE OF**\n**DETERIORATING REGIONAL**\n**UNITY THROUGH ESPIONAGE**\n**ACTIVITIES**\n\n\n**Areas of tension in the South American region**\n\n**Suspected origin of attackers targeting this region**\n\n\n**UNITY THROUGH ESPIONAGE**\n\n\n**DETERIORATING REGIONAL**\n\n\n**TAKE ADVANTAGE OF**\n\n\n**ACTIVITIES**\n\n\n**_DEEP-ROOTED TENSIONS**\n**IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH**\n**AMERICA**\n\n**In recent decades, urban conflicts**\n**have erupted throughout Latin**\n**America in response to several**\n**phenomena including poverty and**\n**rising inequality.

Brazil, for\nexample, is one of the five emer\n\ngent economies known as the\nBRICS countries.\nHowever, since 2011, this growth\nhas been merely relative, and most\nLatin American countries have slid\ninto recession.\nIn fact, after a “golden decade”\nbetween 2003 and 2013, during\nwhich economies boomed and inequalities narrowed, Latin America’s\nGDP (Gross Domestic Products)\nper capita had collapsed to 2010 levels by the end of 2020. The price\nof exported primary commodities\nhas weighed heavily on countries’\nfinancial capacities as well as their\neconomic growth. The fossil fuels\nsector has also been a factor in\nthis crisis: in 2014, oil prices plummeted in Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela.\n\n**_REGIONAL DIVISIONS**\n**STOKING BORDER**\n**CONFLICTS**\n\n\n**TIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES**\n\n\n**_INTERNAL CONFLICTS**\n\n\n**STOKING BORDER**\n\n\nBorder conflicts in this region are\nnothing new. For hundreds of years,\n\n\nfor several international conflicts,\nwith some still ongoing that stretch\nback to the 19th century.\nToday, political disagreements\nbetween countries continue for a\nvariety of reasons, including various permutations of nationalism\nand conflicts of economic interest.\nThese battles are fought in the\nraw materials sector, particularly\noil and gas, as well as within the\nframework of increasingly fragile\nregional alliances.\nOn 1 May 2006, Evo Morales nationalised Bolivia’s oil wells, hitting\nBrazilian company Petrobras (a\nthird of whose shares are owned\nby the Brazilian government) particularly hard and impacting other\nforeign companies including Spain’s\nRepsol. In response to objections\nby Brazil, backed by Argentina, Bolivia gained the support of Venezuela, resulting in a temporary schism\nbetween the region’s left-wing governments.\nFurthermore, more than ten years\nafter its founding treaty was signed,\n\n\n0\n\nAmerican societies. The OECD has\nexpressed concern at deteriorating\nsocial cohesion and growing alienation between citizens and public\ninstitutions in all countries in the\nregion.\nWith the exception of Venezuela,\nwhere political and economic crises\nhave triggered a humanitarian crisis, the resultant turbulence has\nmanifested internally in other South American countries.

However,\nsuch decisions can exacerbate inequalities, increase tension in society and sometimes result in a\nviolent backlash by the population.\nThis was the case in Chile, in 2019,\nwhere a political decision was made\nto increase ticket prices on the\nSantiago Metro.\nThis was merely a catalyst for a\nmuch broader protest movement\nchallenging the Chilean economic model and spotlighting the\n\ncountry’s inequalities. Surging poverty and inequality, deteriorating\npublic services and wage stagnation, combined with ever-increasing precarity and unemployment,\nhave laid bare widespread dissatisfaction and defiance towards elites\nand governments.\nIn addition, corruption scandals\ncontinue to come to light in a ma\n\nmining the legitimacy of political\nsystems and institutions as the public discovers their extent. The Odebrecht case embodies the current\nsituation with regard to corruption.\nSome 10 countries have been impacted by the scandal, which led to\nthe downfall of Peruvian president\nPedro Pablo Kuczynski.\nAll of these factors have coalesced\nto breed discontentment within Latin American societies and foster a\nfeeling of insecurity. Rising crime,\nwhether tangible or virtual, has\nmade the region one of the most\ndangerous in the world.\nLatin America is home to 40 of\n\nthe 44 cities where criminal activity poses the most severe threat.\nFor instance, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have the highest homicide rates in the world. Much of this urban violence is\nperpetrated by gangs, specialized\nin drug trafficking. Indeed, due to\nits geography, Latin America is an\nactive participant in the drug trade\n\n\ncaine. Figures show that 80% of\ncocaine arriving in the country\ntransits through Central America.\nThis lucrative and straightforward\nbusiness has led to the formation\nof thousands of small, violent gangs\nacross the region (including maras,\nMexican cartels and Brazilian mafia\norganisations). Law enforcement\nand politicians are often powerless\nto stop them, and the rot is often\nworsened by corruption and public\nofficials accepting bribes.\n\n**_LATIN AMERICA’S**\n**INSTABILITY HAS LED**\n**TO WIDESPREAD PRECARITY,**\n**OPENING THE DOOR FOR**\n**CYBERCRIMINALS TO**\n**CONDUCT VARIOUS TYPES**\n**OF ATTACK CAMPAIGNS BOTH**\n**WITHIN THE REGION AND**\n**AROUND THE WORLD**\n\n_These groups include ATK237, also_\n_known as the Tetrade.

As with Yemen, the\nconflict became international when\nIslamic State got involved in 2013.\nWhat began as a national conflict\nquickly turned into a regional and\ninternational conflict in which Russia, Iran and Turkey have taken\npart. Russia and Iran have sent\nmilitias to support President Assad’s regime and its strategic interests in the region. Turkey sent\nin its armed forces in late 2019\nafter the US withdrawal from the\nregion, officially to protect its borders and fight jihadists. Unofficially,\nTurkey has also been fighting the\nKurds, with whom it is in conflict\nwithin its borders.

In June\n2017, after some comments allegedly made by the Emir of Qatar in\nwhich he praised Iran, Hezbollah\nand the Muslim Brotherhood, the\npetro-monarchies of the gulf severed diplomatic ties with Qatar.\nOn 16 July 2017, the Washington\nPost claimed, based on sources\nfrom the US Secret Service, that\nthe statement from the Emir originated from a computer hack perpetrated by the UAE. The objective of\ndestabilizing the Qatari emirate and\nasserting Saudi power in the region\nhas proven to be counterproductive,\nas witnessed by the rapprochement\nbetween Qatar and Iran.\nAbove all, this crisis reveals the\nfragmentation of the Middle East\naround the opposition between\nSunni Wahhabi Saudi Arabia and\nShiite Iran. This confrontation is not\nsimply religious, with Sunnism and\nShiism, or cultural through Arab or\nPersian influences, but geopolitical\nwith a desire for power and influence\nin the Western Asia zone. As during the Cold War, the neighbouring civil wars in Syria, Yemen and\nto a lesser extent Libya are turning\ninto theatres of indirect confrontation between the two blocs.\n\n**_JERUSALEM AND THE**\n**ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN**\n**CONFLICT**\n\nThis diversity of religions lies at\nthe heart of the ancient problem in\nthe city of Jerusalem, which is the\ncradle of the three monotheistic religions (Islam, Judaism and Christianity) Long contested because of\n\n\n_grams that allow full remote control_\n_of a computer from another device._\n_DarkComet is a French-made RAT_\n_that has been modified to spy on Sy-_\n_rian revolutionary forces._\n_Secondly, the Damascus regime_\n_uses the cyber tool to destabilize its_\n_opponents. For example, the Syrian_\n_government regularly cuts off the_\n_country’s communications to in-_\n_terfere with the rebels’ exchanges._\n_In addition to cutting off the Inter-_\n_net and GSM networks at strategic_\n_times, it may send a large number_\n_of connection requests in order to_\n_saturate the network._\n_The Syrian leaders regularly mobilise_\n_hacker groups, such as ATK132 (Sy-_\n_rian Electronic Army) which carry_\n_out DDoS (distributed denial of ser-_\n_vice) or defacement attacks. Certain_\n_Arabic media outlets are regularly_\n_targeted by the Syrian Electronic_\n_Army (SEA). For example, the we-_\n_bsite of the Qatar-based Al Jazee-_\n_ra news channel was hacked by the_\n_SEA in April 2012. At the same time,_\n_the Twitter account of Al Arabiya, a_\n_Saudi Arabian television news out-_\n_let, posted bogus messages about_\n_an explosion at a Qatar gas facility,_\n_the replacement of Qatar’s Prime_\n_Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister_\n_and the arrest of the Prime Minis-_\n_ter’s daughter in London. The SEA_\n_was almost certainly seeking to exa-_\n_cerbate the tensions between Qatar_\n_and Saudi Arabia in order to under-_\n_mine their partnership on the Syrian_\n_issue. In January 2013, the Syrian_\n_Electronic Army announced that it_\n_had several documents detailing the_\n_role played by Turkey, Saudi Ara-_\n_bia and Qatar in the Arab world for_\n_nearly two years. This information_\n_was later published on the website_\n_of Al Akhbar, a Lebanese newspaper_\n_that is reputedly pro-Hezbollah. This_\n_type of initiative is frequent and the_\n_countries targeted are always those_\n_that take an official position against_\n_Bashar al-Assad and that are ac-_\n_cused by the Syrian government of_\n_militarily supporting the opposition._\n\n**_STRUCTURE OF THE CYBER-**\n**THREAT GENERATED BY THE**\n**ASSAD REGIME**\n\n_The Pat Bear group (ATK85) should_\n_not be confused with the SEA,_\n_though it is related to it.

Numerous\nconfrontations between Arabs and\nJews ensued in the second half of\nthe 20th century, and countries\noutside the conflict took a position.\nWhat the Arab League contests is\nIsrael’s policy of expansion, which\nit considers illegitimate. The Palestinians do not hesitate to protest\nagainst this policy, and various terrorist movements have been born\nout of this conflict. One example\nis Hamas, which carried out suicide attacks until 2005 and now\nfocuses on attacks on Israeli cities. In response, Israel has stepped up its militarisation and accelerated the process of expansion\ninto the Palestinian territories. In\nearly 2021, clashes in Gaza, under\nIsraeli control, flared up again like\na recurring theme. They serve as a\ni d that th i f t it\n\n\n_support the President’s image and_\n_positions in a context of dissent and_\n_violence against civilians.

This group_\n_also came out of the SEA, but it_\n_does not have the same missions. It_\n_specialises in espionage and main-_\n_ly directs its actions at the natio-_\n_nal level.

As a result, these countries\nsatisfy the primary needs of their\npopulations, such as medical care\nand social infrastructure (universities, etc.) and even exempt them\nfrom taxes.\nHydrocarbons are like a drug in the\nMiddle East. Internally, the rentier\ncountries enjoy the satisfaction of\nsubstantial and continuous income\nstreams. However, this income is\ndependent on world prices, which\ncan create a kind of “withdrawal”\neffect. This serves as a geopolitical\n\n\ncontext of the Iran-Saudi Arabia\nproxy conflict.\nRiyadh and Tehran are among the\nbest supplied with hydrocarbons\nand the largest producers in the\nregion. In 1960, they helped create\nthe Organisation of the Petroleum\nExporting Countries (OPEC) but\nsoon began to display doctrinal\ndivergences, especially at the Caracas summit in 1977, where the\nmembers aligned around Saudi\nArabia’s productivist vision. Since\nthe 1980s, Saudi Arabia has increased its production in order to\nbring down the price per barrel and\nput financial pressure on Iran. The\nIranian economy, which was not\ndiversified at the time, was quickly\nhit by American sanctions in the\n1990s.\nIn the future, this energy lever could\npose a significant risk of geopolitical destabilisation and lead to an\nincrease in the level of cyberthreat.\n\n\n###### Conclusion\n\n As we have seen, the Middle Eastern cyberthreat landscape is shaped by several geopoliti- cal factors. The region is highly polarised around a fundamen- tal divergence between Saudi Arabia and Iran. This polarisa- tion takes the form of a subre\n\n###### gional Cold War with a “bloc” logic that is often reduced to a simple opposition between Sunnis and Shiites, but which in reality is much more com- plex. These two blocs confront each other indirectly in war zones such as Syria and Ye\n\n###### men, as well as through militia or Islamist intermediaries. Ultimately, this complexity is transposed into cyberspace with an array of hacker groups and a sustained level of activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 70 ATKS (Attackers)\n**targeted the aera**\n\n\n###### _Adversary Type\n\n _Terrorists _State-Sponsored _Cyber Criminal\n\n\n###### 3 3\n\n _Adversary type\n\n _Energy\n\n _Manufacturing\n\n _Communication\n\n _Transportation\n\n _Education\n\n _Aviation\n\n\n###### 36\n\n\n###### _Top 3 attacked sectors\n\n Energy Education Manufacturing\n\n\n###### Zone East Asia _\n\nBurma Vietnam\nBrunei China\nCambodia Japan\nIndonesia North Korea\nLaos South Korea\nMalaysia Taiwan\nPhilippines Mongolia\nSingapore\nThailand\nEast Timor\n\n\n-----\n\n_gust 2017 attacked its political insti-_\n_tutions.

On 5 August 2017, the mee-_\n_ting of foreign ministers of ASEAN_\n_countries in Manila had resulted in a_\n_resurgence of tensions provoked by_\n_Vietnam against China._\n_In addition to the ATK34 group, of_\n_which Goblin Panda is a part, the_\n_ATK1 group (Lotus Blossom) re-_\n_gularly attacks the region. Before_\n_2013, one of the group’s hackers_\n_called Elise installed backdoors on_\n_Southeast Asian networks, focu-_\n_sing especially on electronics ma-_\n_nufacturers and telecommunication_\n_companies, which enabled attackers_\n_to penetrate the systems[7]. In 2015,_\n_ATK1 conducted massive espionage_\n_campaigns aimed at government_\n_and military organisations across_\n_Southeast Asia[8]. These campaigns,_\n_whose objective was to weaken_\n_political organizations and spy on_\n_group members, are still ongoing._\n_The most prominent example is the_\n_ASEAN, which suffered from a cyber_\n_espionage attack operated by ATK1_\n_in January 2018[9]._\n_Other groups, considered less pro-_\n_lific, appear to be more responsive_\n_to a political agenda. ATK34’s cam-_\n_paign of attacks on Vietnamese ins-_\n_titutions in August 2017, for one,_\n_reflects intensifying tensions with_\n_China. The ATK29 (TEMP.Periscope)_\n_group has also demonstrated its_\n_ability to exploit local contexts and_\n_leverage them into cyber attack op-_\n_portunities. ATK29’s campaign in_\n_Cambodia in July 2018 during the_\n_legislative elections is indicative of_\n_this trend. ATK29 group is interes-_\n_ting because the first evidence of its_\n_activity dates from the start of the_\n_Silk Roads project in 2013._\n_Initially focusing on the maritime do-_\n_main, its range of targets was later_\n_extended to the defence, transporta-_\n_tion, engineering and space sectors._\n_In recent campaigns, it has directed_\n_its attacks at the countries involved_\n_in the Silk Roads project, reflecting_\n_a shift in targets and paradigm.

However, the\nsummer 2021 was marked by a\nformal meeting between Taliban\nleaders and an Indian delegation in\nQatar.\nRelations between Pakistan and\nthe Taliban are more complex,\nespecially since the Taliban announced that it does not recognise\nthe Durand Line, which marks the\nborder between the two countries.\nFurthermore, Pakistan, like Afghanistan, has suffered Taliban attacks\non its soil, which has prompted the\ntwo countries to cooperate more\nclosely in recent years.\nDespite Afghanistan’s instability\nand this historic context, both India\nand Pakistan are trying to cooperate with their neighbour. Notably,\nPakistan has reached a Memorandum of Understanding with Afghanistan for the establishment of\nthe Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit\nTrade Agreement (APTTA) and the\nconstruction of a rail link between\nthe two countries. This cooperation\nmay extend to joint defence and intelligence sharing operations.\nIn turn, India, which historically\nhas a stronger relationship with\nAfghanistan, has set up agricultural development projects on Afghan\nterritory and, in the last decade, several hundred Afghan soldiers have\nbeen trained at Indian institutions.\n\n**_DESPITE THESE PARALLEL**\n**BILATERAL COOPERATIONS,**\n**WHICH REMAIN IN PLACE TO-**\n**DAY, CYBER OPERATIONS ARE**\n**STILL BEING CONDUCTED**\n\n_For example, the ATK64 group_\n_(Transparent Tribe, APT36), suspec-_\n_ted of being sponsored by Pakistan,_\n_has repeatedly targeted Afghanistan_\n_in espionage operations.

Pakistan is a predominantly Muslim\ncountry that was formed as the\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan. India,\nconversely, is a secular state that\ninherited much of the territory of\nthe Raj.\nShortly after independence, the\nFirst Indo-Pakistani war took place\nin Kashmir. The Kashmir region,\nindependent since 1947, spans territories claimed by India, Pakistan\nand China. Pakistan and India lay\nclaim to all of these territories. Reflecting this complex heritage, the\npopulation of Kashmir is now predominantly Muslim, but it is ruled\nby a Hindu Maharaja.\nThis first war ended in 1949 after\nthe United Nations brokered a ceasefire agreement based on a future Line of Control (LoC). Since\nthe LoC was established, Kashmir\nhas been a region in two parts: Indian Kashmir and Pakistani Kashmir. The Line of Control has become a militarised zone with the\n\n\n**BILATERAL COOPERATIONS,**\n\n\n**THE UNSTABLE STATE**\n\n\noff across the divide. The Indo-Pakistani conflict remains crystallized\non the Kashmir issue. Today, the\nborder between India and Pakistan\nis considered one of the most dangerous in the world.\nOn 14 February 2019, tensions\nbetween Pakistan and India reignited when a suicide attack claimed by Pakistan-based Islamist\ngroup Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM)\nkilled 41 Indian soldiers. The attacker was a 20-year-old Kashmiri rebel, whose act led to a resurgence\nof military activism in the region.\nNarendra Modi, Prime Minister of\nIndia since 2014, condemned the\nattack and announced that there\nwould be a response.\nOn 18 February, in retaliation, India conducted an armed raid in the\narea where the attack had taken\n\n\n**_DESPITE THESE PARALLEL**\n\n\n**_AFGHANISTAN:**\n\n\nplace. Nine people were killed in\nthe town of Balakot, where a JeM\ntraining camp is located. The resurgence of terrorist attacks in the\nregion is worrisome for the Indian\ngovernment, which is using all\npossible means to protect against\nthem. Since both countries are\nnuclear powers, and the border\nbetween them is one of the most\nmilitarised in the world, an open\nconflict would be devastating for\nthe region.\n\n**_FOR THIS REASON, THE**\n**CYBER LEVER APPEARS THE**\n**BEST WAY FOR EACH SIDE**\n**TO ASSERT ITS CLAIMS**\n\n_Indo-Pakistani tension is most-_\n_ly latent, with no open and direct_\n_confrontation since 1971_ _Nonethe_\n\n\n_less, current tensions are high, and_\n_groups of cyberattackers, suspected_\n_to be from both countries, regular-_\n_ly conduct operations against each_\n_other’s security forces.

Historically, each country’s bilateral\nrelations with its Afghan neighbour\nhave oscillated between long-term\nsupport projects and containment\nactions linked to the presence of\nthe Taliban.\nIndia was the only South Asian\ncountry to recognise the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of\nAfghanistan in the 1980s. In turn,\nPakistan suffered destabilisation attempts perpetrated by the Soviets\nand implemented by the Afghan\ngovernment with the objective of\narming Pakistan’s Pashtun independence fighters so they could\noverthrow the regime of the time.\nSince then, Pakistan has continued\nto treat its westerly neighbour with\nsuspicion.\nWith the rise of the Taliban movement, both countries have maintained their course of action. India\nsupported the then regime, helping\noverthrow the Taliban, while Pakistan has been regularly accused\nby Afghanistan of funding the mujahideen through its Inter-Services\nIntelligence (ISI)\n\n\nthe Indian government and education departments. In the case of\nthe attacks against Afghanistan,\nthe attacker was able to exfiltrate\nnumerous personal documents including diplomatic visas as well as\nthe IDs of Afghan government officials. SideCopy APT uses fake documents as well as Trojan Horses\ndistributed via spear-phishing techniques[2].\n\n**_COMMITMENT TO REGIONAL**\n**INTEGRATION**\n\n**_SOUTH ASIAN ASSOCIATION**\n**FOR REGIONAL COOPERA-**\n**TION**\n\nAt the regional scale, the eight\nSouth Asian countries created the\nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in 1985\nto promote cooperation between\nmember states and drive economic\ndevelopment.\nThis regional organisation has permanent links with the United Nations as an observer. It has also\ndeveloped ties with other regional organisations such as the European Union. In 2006, SAARC\ncreated the South Asian Free Trade\nArea (SAFTA) encompassing 1.6 billion people.\nAt the local level, cooperation projects are emerging. In 2015, the gas\npipeline project linking four South\nAsian countries, namely Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and\nIndia, was born. This project, which\nallows the countries to achieve\ngreater energy autonomy, strengthens the ties between the South\nAsian states.\nThese various cooperation projects,\naimed at better regional integration\nand economic development, are\nalso intended to give the countries\nin the region greater autonomy with\nrespect to neighbouring powers.\nThe region is surrounded by China\nto the north and east and by Iran\nto the west. It should also be noted\nthat Russia, further north, has a\nhistoric influence in the region. This\ninfluence has been achieved by cyberthreat actors suspected of being\nsponsored by these neighbouring\npowers.\n\n\n**DAY, CYBER OPERATIONS ARE**\n\n\n**CYBER LEVER APPEARS THE**\n\n\n**BEST WAY FOR EACH SIDE**\n\n\n**TO ASSERT ITS CLAIMS**\n\n\n-----\n\n_SEVERAL GROUPS POTENTIAL-_\nLY SUPPORTED BY CHINA HAVE\nTARGETED THE REGION.

This is reflected in the many cyberattacks between groups in these countries. However, the states in question are trying to overcome the dif- ficulties through development projects, bilateral and multila- teral cooperation and the crea- tion of a free trade area. These challenging attempts are motivated by an awareness of a broader contextual dimen- sion. Regional integration, al- beit imperfect, should help the\n\n\nA COMPLEX SINO-INDIAN RELATIONSHIP, SOURCE OF POLITICAL TENSIONS AND CYBER OPERATIONS\nChina and India are states that share\nmany similarities. Formerly under\ncolonial rule, both countries have\nexperienced exceptional economic\nand demographic growth that has\nallowed them to assert themselves\nas major powers at the regional and\nglobal levels. The two governments\nmaintain close relations, particularly at the economic level, marked by\nbilateral partnerships and their leading role in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). In spite of\nthis collaboration, tensions remain\nbetween the two political regimes\nas they clash over their common\nfrontier as well as over the trade\nroutes developed in recent years.\n\nCONFLICT AROUND THE SINO-INDIAN BORDER ZONE\nJune 15, 2020 is an important\ndate in the evolution of the border\nconflict between the two countries. For the first time in 45 years,\nthe frontier zone was the scene of\nviolent clashes leading to the death\n\n\nof Indian and Chinese soldiers in\nthe mountainous Galwan River valley. This historic conflict is based\non divergent views between the\ntwo regimes, with India considering the frontier region to be nearly 3500 km long, compared to an\nestimate repeated by the Chinese\nmedia of around 2000 km. While\nthe likelihood of an open conflict\nbetween India and China remains\nlow, the intensification of tensions\nrelated to the frontier regions could\nlead both sides to resort more frequently to the cyber tool.\n\nSILK ROAD AND FREEDOM\nROAD: A SYMBOL OF SINO-INDIAN RIVALRY\nIn 2013, Xi Jinping gave a speech\nin Astana in which he unveiled the\ncomprehensive project to build infrastructure along the ancient Silk\nRoads. This project called «The New\nSilk Roads» shows the Chinese hegemonic ambition to create a new\nstrategic paradigm along land and\nsea routes. In order to compete\nwith this ambition, India and Japan\nhave developed an infrastructure\nand transport project that is sup\n\n_launched massive campaigns against_\n_the country. The government, the_\n_Indian Informatic Centre, the de-_\n_fence industry, telecom providers_\n_and even NGOs were targeted. An IP_\n_address of one of the attackers was_\n_associated with a university based in_\n_Chengdu, China. The same targets_\n_were attacked in 2018 by operations_\n_attributed to ATK2 (Wicked Panda)._\n_This campaign appears to be re-_\n_lated to the inauguration of the port_\n_of Chabahar, Iran, a competitor to_\n_Gwadar, a few months earlier._\n\n###### Conclusion\n\n South Asia is a geographic re- gion that tends to move towar- ds closer unity despite the dis- sensions and diversities. It is physically permeated by contradictory geopolitical is- sues, culturally shaped by be- liefs, which are hard to re- concile, and historically marked by a heritage of conflict. Ten- sions between India and Pa- kistan, the instability of Afgha- nistan and the great difference in development and wealth between the countries make\n\n\n###### countries in the region protect from neighbouring influences and gain significance on the international stage in an auto- nomous manner. As we have seen, cyberattacks from neighbouring countries occur regularly and often fo- cus on destabilisation and es- pionage by exploiting these historic, cultural and physical animosities.\n\n\nposed to revitalize the trade routes\nbetween the Asian and African\ncontinents: the «Freedom Road».\nThe rivalry between both projects\ntends to intensify tensions between\nBeijing and New Delhi. The port of\nGwadar, a symbol of the «New Silk\nRoads», has to face competition\nfrom the port of Chabahar, inaugurated in 2017 by an Indo-Iranian\nalliance wishing to challenge the\ngrip of Chinese influence in Central\nAsia.\n\nTHE RISE IN SINO-INDIAN TENSIONS HAS LED TO A SHARP\nINCREASE IN CYBER ESPIONAGE\nACTIVITIES BY CHINESE-BASED\nATTACKER GROUPS ON INDIAN\nTERRITORY\n_The energy sector has been parti-_\n_cularly affected, as have port facili-_\n_ties.

It also includes New Zealand and Australia, larger countries which are more eco- nomically developed than the is- land states.\n\n The region’s dynamics play out at Pacific-wide, sub-regional, and island levels. While Austra\n\n###### lia and New Zealand stand out as key countries thanks to their demographic and economic im- portance, the island states of Oceania are still over-dependent on other countries, leading to the development of a “nor- th-south” divide in the region.\n Largely ignored in the history of international relations, Oceania has emerged as a zone of signi- ficant strategic interest in the post-war period. Australia and New Zealand are seeking exten- sive US engagement in Oceania, while affirming their position as regional powers.\n\n\n**_NEW ZEALAND’S POSITION**\n**IN THE OCEANIA REGION**\n\nThe intensification of tensions\nbetween China and Australia\nraises questions about New Zealand’s strategic positioning in this\nnew context.

Canberra requested that China apologise for this attack on the conduct\nof Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, but received no reply.\nThis series of diplomatic incidents\nbetween the two countries must be\nviewed within the context of Australia’s broader security concerns\nabout Chinese growth presenting a\nthreat to the Asia-Pacific region.

Starting\nin May 2020, for example, China\nintroduced a series of commercial\nsanctions against Australian products. The sanctions resulted in\nhigher tariffs and stricter quotas\nbeing imposed on Australian products such as wine or barley.\nIn parallel with these commercial tensions, diplomatic disputes\nbetween the two countries also\nintensified.

In November 2020,\nthis new role took shape when the\nalliance condemned China’s intervention in Hong Kong and called for\nthe reinstatement of the members\nof the Legislative Council who had\nbeen suspended by Beijing. This declaration also denounced the treatment of the Uighur population.\nWhile New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern spoke of the\ndifficulty of «reconciling» differences\nbetween the two countries, Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta refused\nto join the Five Eyes alliance’s\ncondemnation of the treatment of\nthe Uighur minority in Xinjiang province.\nThis statement, in addition to jeopardizing the alliance’s political\nproject, shows the fragility of New\nZealand’s diplomatic position, torn\nbetween preserving its relationship\nwith Australia and its economic\n\n\nwell-being. The progressive militarization in the South China Sea and\nChinese interference in Hong Kong\ncould lead New Zealand to adopt\na clearer strategic line in the future. Depending on the positioning\nchosen, New Zealand could become a breeding ground for offensive\nactivity by Chinese cyber attackers.\n\n**_AUSTRALIA AND THE NEW**\n**AUKUS ALLIANCE IN THE IN-**\n**DO-PACIFIC REGION**\n\n**AUKUS (an acronym based on the**\n**country names Australia, United**\n**Kingdom and United States) is a**\n**new trilateral strategic defence al-**\n**liance. It was initially created for**\n**the purpose of constructing a class**\n**of nuclear-powered submarines,**\n**collaborating in the Indo-Pacific**\n**region (where the rise of China is**\n**viewed as a growing threat), and**\n**developing more advanced tech-**\n\n\n**nologies. The agreement led Aus-**\n**tralia to terminate the contract**\n**awarded to France in 2016 for the**\n**construction of 12 diesel-electric**\n**submarines to replace its ageing**\n**fleet of Collins-class submarines.**\n**Australia decided in November**\n**2021 to engage alongside its Ame-**\n**rican and British allies.**\n**Aside from the United Kingdom,**\n**this is the first time that the**\n**United States has shared nuclear**\n**propulsion technology with an ally.**\n**Consequently,** **many** **observers**\n**believe that Australia, the United**\n**Kingdom and the United States**\n**have entered into a historic nuclear**\n**defence and security agreement**\n**which will have consequences in**\n**the Indo-Pacific region for decades**\n**to come. The agreement will en-**\n**able Australia to build a fleet of at**\n**least eight nuclear attack subma-**\n**rines in order to counter Chinese**\n**influence.**\n**However, it is also interesting to**\n**note that the AUKUS agreement**\n\n\n**will include artificial intelligence as**\n**well as other technologies, such**\n**as cybersecurity. AUKUS could**\n**therefore be one of the most im-**\n**portant defence and cooperation**\n**alliances for decades.**\n**According to the associated press**\n**release, the partnership is a his-**\n**toric opportunity for the three**\n**nations to protect their shared**\n**values, and contribute to the stabi-**\n**lity and prosperity of the Indo-Pa-**\n**cific region, together with friends**\n**and partners who share the same**\n**ideas.**\n\n_The decision to involve Austra-_\n_lia in the longstanding cooperation_\n_between the US and the UK reflects_\n_the West’s growing concern about_\n\n\n_Beijing’s military expansion, debt di-_\n_plomacy and cyber-intimidation._\n\n**_THE AUKUS ALLIANCE GOES**\n**WELL BEYOND JUST SUBMA-**\n**RINES**\n\n_Attention has focused on French_\n_and Australian diesel/nuclear sub-_\n_marines, and military hardware is_\n_certainly a key component, in view_\n_of the geopolitical issues at stake._\n_However, the agreement also covers_\n_other forms of conflict. The AUKUS_\n_alliance attaches particular impor-_\n_tance to cyberspace._\n_At the press conference announ-_\n_cing the agreement, US president_\n_Joe Biden said that a cybersecurity_\n_component would be included, in_\n\n\n_addition to submarine technology._\n_Although President Biden did not_\n_specify this during the press confe-_\n_rence, it appears probable that the_\n_United States and the UK would_\n_support Australia in the deployment_\n_of cyber-defence, and potentially also_\n_cyber-attack, capabilities._\n_In recent years, Australia has been_\n_the target of several major cyber-at-_\n_tacks, one of the most striking of_\n_which took place in June 2020._\n_Australian Prime Minister Scott_\n_Morrison went on the record to of-_\n_ficially state that the country had_\n_been the subject of a sophisticated_\n_state-sponsored cyber-attack._\n_Suspecting that China was res-_\n_ponsible, Mr Morrison said that he_\n_had talked to British Prime Minister_\n_Boris Johnson about the incident,_\n_although it is uncertain whether the_\n_United Kingdom had provided cy-_\n_ber-expertise to Australia._\n\n\n**_THE AUKUS ALLIANCE GOES**\n\n\n**RINES**\n\n\n-----\n\n# Attackers\n### Groups\n\n\n-----\n\n**_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON**\n\n\n**_DESCRIPTION**\n\n\n\n**> Attack against Taiwan United**\n**States -

However, Mummy Spider\nswiftly developed the malware capabilities to include an RSA key exchange for command and control\ncommunication and a modular architecture.\nMummy Spider does not follow typical criminal behavioral patterns.\nIn particular, Mummy Spider\nusually conducts attacks for a few\nmonths before ceasing operations\nfor a period of between three and\n12 months, before returning with\na new variant or version. After\na 10 month hiatus, Mummy Spider returned Emotet to operation\nin December 2016 but the latest\nvariant is not deploying a banking\nTrojan module with web injects, it\nis currently acting as a loader delivering other malware packages.\nThe primary modules perform reconnaissance on victim machines,\ndrop freeware tools for credential\ncollection from web browsers and\nmail clients and a spam plugin for\nself-propagation. The malware is\nalso issuing commands to download and execute other malware families such as the banking Trojans\nDridex and Qakbot.\nMummy Spider advertised Emotet\non underground forums until 2015,\nat which time it became private.\nTherefore, it is highly likely that\nEmotet is operated solely for use\nby Mummy Spider or with a small\ntrusted group of customers.\nThe group is composed of competent personnel, and Emotet is\nregularly considered as one of the\nmost threatening malware for businesses.\n\n\nThe group seems to have an interesting interaction with the\nATK103 (TA505). TA505 is a financially motivated group that is\nactive since 2014, seemingly of\nRussian origin. It is a significant\npart of the email threat landscape\nand is responsible of large malicious spam campaigns, mostly to\ndistribute the Dridex and Trickbot banking trojan, the Locky and\nJaff ransomwares, among others.\nTA505 use Necurs botnet to drive\nthese campaigns. It is highly adaptable, often change its malwares\nand techniques, regularly use offthe-shelf malwares and operate on\na massive scale.\nSince March 2018, ATK103 was observed using FlawedAmmyy RAT, a\nvariant of the leaked AmmyyAdmin\n3 (Remote Administration Tool).\nThe use of these tools can make\nus think that this actor is willing to\nswitch from big spam campaigns\nto more targeted attacks.\nFirst, TrickBot is probably the\nmost distributed malware by Emotet, and has been distributed nearly every day since September 2018.\nThe links were rather tenuous\nhowever, and TrickBot was just\nanother malware dropped by Emotet until September 2019. In the\nbeginning of June 2019, the group\ntook a break until September 16,\n2019. The group, as previously\nmentioned, came back with a new\ninfrastructure zone (Epoch 3).\nSince this day, every time that a\nTrickBot malware is deployed via\nEmotet (currently, nearly every\nday) its tag (an identifier that is\nadded to every build of TrickBot)\nfollows a specific pattern, while\nprevious distribution tags were\nseemingly random. This hints to\na bigger cooperation between the\nATK103 group and Emotet. Moreover, on September 18, 2019 the\ngroup introduced a new loader. This\nloader, that is bigger, shares some\ncode with the TrickBot loader.\nThis might mean that the group\n\n\nused the summer break they took\nto strengthen their relationships\nwith ATK103. Indeed, deploying the\ngroup malware in a privileged way\nis one thing, but potentially sharing code is another.\nOn 27 January 2021 Europol announced that the infrastructure\nof the Emotet network had been\nneutralised through a multilateral\npolice operation.\n\n**_USED MALWARES :**\n\n- Emotet\n\n**_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON**\n\n**> Emotet long-running**\n**campaigns**\n_Happened on: 2014-05-01_\n\n**> October 2019 - External SOCs**\n**used as lures by Emotet**\n_Happened on: 2019-10-14_\n\n**> 2021 - Delta Variant Malspam**\n**Campaign**\n_Proofpoint researchers observed_\n_an increase in COVID-19 related_\n_threats since late June 2021.

In most cases they claimed that\nthey took over the account to show\nits owner its low level of security,\nwhile requesting them to contact the\ngroup directly to solve this problem.\nThis shows that the group presents\nitself as a kind of a grey-hat group\nwho looks for vulnerabilities and security issues in order to receive money from the companies in which\nthese issues were found. This was\nalso the case with the two DDoS attacks they launched against HSBC\nbank and Pokemon Go (in 2016 and\n2017 respectively), allegedly to enhance the level of security of those\ncompanies. However, even though\nOurMine tried to show themselves\nas a group that enhances cyber security of companies, some of their\nattacks were done as a revenge. For\nexample, they took over a media website after publishing an article that\nallegedly revealed the real identity of\nthe threat actor behind the group,\na teen from Saudi Arabia. Another\nexample was when they leaked information of a company that did not\ncontact them about security issues\nthey found in its servers. Furthermore, in some cases they tried to\nbrag about their capabilities when\nthey were challenged to hack the\nwebsite of WikiLeaks in 2017. Overall, the group did not launch very\nsophisticated attacks, and all the\nattacks were detected very quickly.\nOf note, since mid 2017, the group is\nnot active, and their website seems\nto be under maintenance.\n\n\nOn January 22, 2020, the group\nstarted to target social medias account (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)\nwhich combined have tens of millions of followers. they published the\nmessage “Hi, we’re OurMine group.\nWe are here for 2 things: 1) Announce that we are back 2) Show\npeople that everything is hackable.\nTo improve your accounts security\ncontact us: contact@ourmine.org”.\n\n**_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON**\n\n**> June-2016 Twitter accounts**\n**hack**\n_Happened on: 2016-06-01_\n\n**> July 2016 HSBC bank DDoS**\n**attack**\n_Happened on: 2016-07-01_\n\n**> August 2016 -

This group is described**\nas a group having a relative lack\nof complexity but they sucessfully\ncompromised their targets which\nare mostly the defence contractors,\nindustrial campanies, shipbuilding companies, telecommunication operators and medias in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. This\ngroup used spearphishing emails\nexploiting CVE-2012-0158 and CVE2012-1856 or contains a web link\nto Oracle Java exploits CVE-20130422 and CVE-2012-1723. It uses\nalready known and patched vulnerabilities. Its lure Word documents\ncontains pictures of a woman or\nare related to political actuality.\nThis group also used HLP files abusing Windows features to drop its\nmalwares.\n\nAfter the initial access, the group\nlist folder on the disk, IP configuration and information about the victim network. If the victim is interesting it deploys additional softwares\nsuch as backdoor and lateral movement tools to dump password from\nWindows, IE or Outlook and a legitimage RAR compressing tool. It\nalso try tool steal Windows address\nbooks (.WAB files) and XSL, DOC\nor HWP documents. The stolen\ndocument are compressed and split\ninto multiple parts using WinRAR\nor CABARC to be transfered to the\nC2 server.\n\nThe lateral movement is done using\nmultiple tools to dump credential\nfrom browsers or Outlook.\n\nThe C2 servers are hosted on shared\nhosting plateforms and dedicated\nhosting. Their C2 infrastructure is\nvery ephemeral. Icefog seems to\nuse a hit and run strategy. They\ninfects their victims, steal the data\nand the C2 infrastructure expires in\na few months. This strategy indicates that they knew what they are\nlooking for. They did not maintain\na persistent presence on the compromised network when their goal\nis reached.\n\nAfter the Kaspersky reports from\nSeptember 2013 and January 2014,\nthe group desapeared. In 2015 after\n\n\nnearly a year of silence, new variants of the ICEFOG (ICEFOG-M\nand ICEFOF-P) have been found,\nused during campaign which targets do not match with previously\nseen campaign.\n\n_NB: According to the researcher_\n_Chi-en Shen from FireEye, the new_\n_variants of the ICEFOG backdoor_\n_are used by multiple Chinese groups_\n_(APT9, APT15, Goblin Panda and_\n_another group name Temp Group_\n_A which can actually be the ori-_\n_ginal Icefog group). The conclusion_\n_is that the ICEFOG backdoor cannot_\n_be used to attribute a campaign._\n\n**_USED MALWARES**\n\n- 8.t Dropper\n\n- ICEFOG\n\n- JavaFog\n\n- MacFog\n\n**_USED TOOLS**\n\n- CABARC\n\n- WinRAR\n\n**_USED VULNERABILITIES**\n\n- CVE-2012-0158\n\n- CVE-2012-1723\n\n- CVE-2012-1856\n\n- CVE-2013-0422\n\n**_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON**\n\n**> Ice Fog campaign against**\n**Japan, South Korea and Taiwan**\n**between 2011 to 2013**\n_Happened on: 2011-01-01_\n\n\n###### Threat Actor_ Targeted Areas_\n\n**ATK23**\n\n(aka: Icefog) is an Chinese\n\ncyber espionange group active\n\nsince at least 2011.\n\n_Type of attacker: State Sponsored\n\n###### Alias_\n\n_Dagger Panda\n_Ice Fog\n_Icefog\n\n###### NORTH AMERICA CENTRAL ASIA\n United States Of America Kazakhstan Canada Uzbekistan\n Targeted Sectors_\n Tajikistan\n\n_Water distribution and supply **NORTHERN EUROPE**\n_Naval Netherlands **SOUTHERN ASIA**\n_Military\n_Media India\n_Maritime Compagnies **WESTERN EUROPE** Sri Lanka\n_High-Tech France Pakistan\n_ Government\n\n###### United Kingdom \n\nand administration agencies\n\n###### Of Great Britain And Northern\n\n_Energy **SOUTH EAST ASIA**\n\n###### Ireland\n\n_Defence\n\n###### Singapore\n\n_Aerospace Germany\n\n###### Philippines\n Italy\n Malaysia\n Austria\n\n EASTERN ASIA\n EASTERN EUROPE\n Languages_\n Taiwan\n Belarus\n\n_Chinese Korea\n\n###### Japan\n MIDDLE EAST/ WESTERN ASIA Hong-Kong Turkey China\n Motivations_\n Mongolia\n\n_Espionage\n\n###### OCEANIA\n Australia\n Suspected origin \n RUSSIA\n of the attacker_\n Russian Federation\n\nChina\n\n2010\n\n2011-01-01\nIce Fog campaign against Japan, South\n\n\n**_USED VULNERABILITIES**\n\n\n**_USED TOOLS**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_MITRE ATT&CK[®] TECHNIQUES**\n**USED BY THIS ATTACKERS GROUP**\n\nT1005 -

The tetrades are\njust a small part of the threat from\nLatin America.\n\nIt is impossible to know or recognize who are the groups or individuals behind its malware.

The link to Iran is argued by SentinelLabs under four\npoints:\n\n- Firstly, the nature of the motivation and the modus operandi\nusing wipers echoes behaviour\nobserved in other groups suspected of being sponsored by the\nIranian state. The nature of the\ntargets is also reminiscent of the\ngeopolitical tension between Iran\nand Israel. Another target located\nin the United Arab Emirates had\nalready been targeted by Iranian\ngroups. It is a critical infrastructure facility of the Emirates.\n\n- Secondly, some of the webshells\ndeployed by the group were modified versions of ASPXSpy. Three\nof these variants were uploaded\nto VirusTotal from Iran, the rest\nfrom other Middle Eastern countries.\n\n- Also, while the group regularly\nuses public VPN providers (e.g.\nProtonVPN), it has used nonVPN nodes from servers linking\nto Iranian domains in the past.\n\n- Finally, Agrius uses the DEADWOOD wiper in its arsenal. This\nsoftware has been linked by some\nsources to ATK35 (APT33), the\nShamoon operator. It seems\nthat Agrius and ATK35 share resources in this matter. This is because the variant used by Agrius\nis an improvement of the original\nsoftware, which implies that the\ngroup had access to the source\ncode of the latter or at least ex\n\nchanged with the original developers. The use of DEADWOOD\ncame shortly after an attempt\nby Agrius to use his personal wiper named Apostle. Apostle was\nprobably not fully operational at\nthe time of its deployment, which\nprompted Agrius to use an equivalent from an outside source.\n\n**_USED MALWARES**\n\n- Apostle Ransomware variant\n\n- Apostle Wiper variant\n\n- DEADWOOD\n\n- IPsec Helper\n\n**_USED VULNERABILITIES**\n\n- CVE-2018-13379\n\n**_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON**\n\n**> 2020 Dec - ATK241 extended**\n**its operations to Israeli targets**\n_Happened on: 2020-12-31_\n\n\n###### Threat Actor_ Targeted Areas_\n\n**ATK241**\n\nA group using ran somware-like extor-\ntion campaigns with data encryption\nto actually using a wiper to destroy\nthe tar get’s data.\n\n###### Alias_\n\n_Agrius\n\n###### Motivations_\n\n_Sabotage **MIDDLE EAST/**\n_Coercion **WESTERN ASIA**\n\n###### United Arab Emirates Israel\n\n Suspected origin of the attacker_\n\nIran\n\n2020\n\n2020-12-31\nATK241 extended its operations to Israeli\n\n\n**_USED VULNERABILITIES**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_USED MALWARES**\n\n\n**_USED TOOLS**\n\n\n2012-01-01 2012-11-01 2015-06-01 2016-12-01 2020-07-01\nDark Caracal First Dark Caracal Operation January 2018: New wave of campaigns\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n\n###### Threat Actor_ Targeted Areas_\n\n**ATK27**\n\n(aka: Dark Caracal) is\n\nan advanced persistence threat\ngroup in activity since January 2012,\nwith a suspected origin of Lebanon.\n\n_Type of attacker: State Sponsored\n\n###### Alias_\n\n_Dark Caracal\n_TAG-CT3\n\n###### NORTH AMERICA SOUTHERN ASIA\n United States Of America Nepal\n India\n Targeted Sectors_\n SOUTH AMERICA Pakistan\n\n_Military\n\n###### Bolivarian Republic \n\n_Media\n_Manufacturing Of Venezuela **SOUTH EAST ASIA**\n_Legal Services Vietnam\n_International Organizations **NORTHEN EUROPE** Thailand\n_Healthcare\n_ Government Netherlands Philippines\nand administration agencies\n_Financial Services **WESTERN EUROPE** **EASTERN ASIA**\n_Education\n\n###### France Korea\n\n_Defence\n\n###### Germany China Italy\n Motivations_ Switzerland RUSSIA Russian Federation\n MIDDLE EAST/\n\n_Ideology\n\n###### WESTERN ASIA\n\n_Financial Gain\n_Coercion Lebanon\n\n###### Saudi Arabia Syria Qatar Jordan\n\n Suspected origin of the attacker_\n\nLebanon\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n\n2012-01-01 2012-11-01 2015-06-01\nDark Caracal First Dark Caracal Operation\n\n\n**_DESCRIPTION**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_MITRE ATT&CK[®] TECHNIQUES**\n**USED BY THIS ATTACKERS GROUP**\n\nT1005 - Data from Local System\nT1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information\nT1027.002 - Software Packing\nT1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter\nT1059.003 - Windows Command Shell\nT1071 - Application Layer Protocol\nT1071.001 - Web Protocols\nT1078 - Valid Accounts\nT1083 - File and Directory Discovery\nT1106 - Native API\nT1113 - Screen Capture\nT1133 - External Remote Services\nT1189 - Drive-by Compromise\nT1195 - Supply Chain Compromise\n\n\n**USED BY THIS ATTACKERS GROUP**\n\n\n**_MITRE ATT&CK**\n\n\n\n**[®]**\n\n\nT1204 - User Execution\nT1204.002 - Malicious File\nT1218.001 - Compiled HTML File\nT1218.002 - Control Panel\nT1547.001 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder\nT1556.003 - Pluggable Authentication Modules\nT1566.003 - Spearphishing via Service\n\n\n**_CYBER ATTACK PHASES**\n\n\n**RECONNAIS-** **RESOURCE** **INITIAL** **EXECUTION**\n**SANCE** **DEVELOPMENT** **ACCESS**\n\n\n**TECHNIQUES**\n\n\n**PERSISTENCE** **PRIVILEGE**\n**ESCALATION**\n\n\n**DEFENSE**\n**EVASION**\n\n\n**CREDENTIAL**\n**ACCESS**\n\n\n**DISCOVERY** **LATERAL**\n**MOVEMENT**\n\n\n**COLLECTION** **COMMAND** **EXFILTRATION** **IMPACT**\n**AND CONTROL**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_USED MALWARES**\n\n\n**ATK29 - Known for their attacks on**\nforeign maritime systems to extract\ndata necessary for the development\nof Chinese navy skills, as well as for\nits geostrategic use in the context\nof the New Silk Roads project.

Since March 2019, there has\nbeen a paradigm shift and a change\nin the sectors targeted by the group.\nThus, while the group had mainly\ntargeted maritime companies in order to catch up with the Chinese\nNavy, it is increasingly targeting\npolitical organizations in Southeast\nAsia. The purpose of these spying\nactions is to support the Chinese\nSilk Roads project on freight transport infrastructure projects.\nATK29 is a group whose campaigns\nobey the Chinese needs for technological catch-up and Beijing’s\ndiplomatic ambitions. The group is\nalways very active, and is composed\nof competent people. Its arsenal is\ncomposed of many tools, which\nare regularly changed. It is quite\nreactive and has, in the past, used\nsecurity vulnerabilities only a few\ndays after their publication. Many\nof the tools used by this group are\nalso used by other Chinese state\nattackers, suggesting exchanges of\nskills and tools between different\nsections. In addition, the group\nshared its infrastructure with another group of Chinese attackers,\nHellsing.\nIn January 2020, the group was\nobserved targeting Malaysian Government officials.

Europol described the scale\nof the attack as «unprecedented».\nAlready in 2014, North Korea had\nattacked Sony Pictures. Due to\nthe scale of the damage, the U.S\nreceived help from Microsoft and\nFacebook to counter WannaCry.\nMicrosoft in a publication confirmed the statements of the British\nNCSC and stated that «by working\nwith Facebook and other members\nof the security community, we\nhave taken strong measures to\nprotect our customers and the Internet from ongoing attacks by an\nadvanced player in the persistent\nthreats known as ZINC also known\nas the Lazarus Group». The attack,\nwhile reaching known geopolitical\nenemies such as Britain, whose\nHealth National Service (NHS) was\nhit hard, also spread to states relatively close to North Korea such as\nRussia. The country’s postal services were also severely disrupted.\n\n**_A cyber tool at the service**\n**of the regime’s domestic and fo-**\n**reign policy**\n\nNorth Korea is using its cyber capabilities for two geopolitical purposes. First, as with the Sony and\nWannaCry attacks, the country\nis very simply targeting its classic\ngeopolitical enemies. In June 2018,\nfor example, North Korean hackers\ntargeted a South Korean think tank\nspecializing in national security issues. The hackers took advantage\nof a zero-day to compromise the\norganization’s website and insert a\nbackdoor for code injection. Earlier\nin April 2018, Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups targeted Japanese defence companies to obtain information on Tokyo’s policy\ntowards North Korea. This information was likely shared. In May it was\n\n\n**_DESCRIPTION**\n\n\n**The International Context as a**\n**Driver of the North Korean Cyber**\n**Strategy.**\n\n**_Recent history implications**\n\nAsia’s recent geopolitics is not only\nstructured by China’s economic\nand informational stranglehold, via\nnew international institutions and\nvassalized digital champions, but\nalso by North Korea, whose recent\npolicies remain difficult to pin down.\nNorth Korea’s foreign policy orientations are nevertheless indexed to\nthe confrontation with the United\nStates.\n\nIt should be recalled that in February 2007 relations between the two\ncountries were due to be normalized following a bilateral agreement\nsigned in Beijing to record the closure of the Yongbyon power station.\nHowever, one year after the agreement, North Korea announced the\nreopening of this power station before firing a Unha-2 rocket which\nwas supposed to carry a communications satellite in April 2009.\nHowever, according to military\nsecurity experts, it was a ballistic\nmissile. Since then, relations have\nfluctuated between tension and\ncalm as North Korea under embargo is caught by the throat. In order\nto calm its adversary, the United\nStates is providing food aid in exchange for a restraint effort. However, the aid is not enough, and North Korea has no other choice but\nto repeat its pressure or to resort\nto perilous barter. Therefore, for\ndecades, North Korea has been exchanging arms with countries such\nas Syria, Iran, Congo, Myanmar,\nEritrea or Yemen in exchange for\nfood. The year 2018 is interesting\nfrom this point of view, since the\nparadigm of relations between the\nUnited States and North Korea has\ntaken an unexpected turn.\n\n**_A new relationship with the**\n**United States?**\n\nAfter months of great tension\nbetween Donald J. Trump and Kin\nJung Un, which caused the international community to fear a nuclear\n\n\nproposed to the American President\na meeting to discuss his country’s\nmilitary nuclearization. Prior to the\nmeeting on 12 June 2018, Kim Jung\nUn redesigned the North Korean\narmy and said he wanted to maintain \"the momentum of appeasement with the United States and\nits willingness to eventually give up\nits nuclear deterrent. The summit\nresulted in a joint statement: Joint\nStatement of President Donald J.\nTrump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of\nthe Democratic People’s Republic\nof Korea at the Singapore Summit.\nFour main points emerged from\nthis statement.\n\nFirst, the United States and North Korea are committed to establishing a new relationship in accordance with the desire of the people\nof both countries for peace and\nprosperity. Second, the two countries will join efforts to establish\na lasting and stable peace regime\non the Korean Peninsula. Thirdly,\nby reaffirming the Panmunjeom\nDeclaration of 27 April 2018, North Korea is committed to working\ntowards the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Finally, the two States undertake to\nrecover the bodies of prisoners of\nwar and missing in action, including the immediate repatriation of\nthose already identified. The declaration also mentions that D.J. Trump undertakes to provide security\nguarantees to North Korea in return.\n\n**_Cyber as a new strategic lever**\n**for North Korean ambitions**\n\nHow can we understand this turnaround in the geopolitical situation?\nA potential answer: a new cyber\nstrategy.\n\nNorth Korea is not to be outdone\nin this respect. Already in December 2017, the peninsular state\nhad already distinguished itself with\nthe WannaCry malware affair. In a\nquasi-joint statement, the United\nStates and Great Britain stated\nthat North Korea was behind this\nmassive attack, which affected almost 300,000 computers in 150\ncountries and caused billions of\n\n\n###### Threat Actor_ Targeted Areas_\n\n**ATK3**\n\nThis threat group represents the\nBu reau 121 which is one of the eight\nBureaus associated to the Recon-\nnaissance General Bureau.

Compromised Android\napplications, hosted on Google Play,\nwere stealing information from the\ndevices and allowing the insertion\nof codes stealing photos, contact\nlists and SMS messages.\n\nIn addition to these direct attacks\nor cyber-espionage actions of geopolitical origin, North Korea uses\ncyber-espionage as a repercussion of geopolitical situations. As\nwe mentioned, the country has to\nuse barter to support itself and to\ncircumvent the Western embargo.\nCyber-attacks have become the\nnew tool of this North Korean policy of survival. In August 2018, the\nIndian bank Cosmos was robbed of\n13.5 million dollars by North Korean\nhackers who, after penetrating the\nstructure’s banking system and\nmaking thousands of unauthorized\nATM withdrawals, made several illegal money transfers via the SWIFT\nfinancial network. The same technique was used, and the same\nconsequences were seen in April\n2018 at a Central American online\ncasino with the aim of siphoning off\nfunds. Finally, although there are\nmany examples, as early as March\n2018 the group of hackers in question targeted several major Turkish banks and government funding\nagencies.\n\n**_What does Lazarus really mean?**\n\nThe North Korean cyber threat\nstructure is unique. Several high-level groups exist with the characteristic of being dedicated to a specific function. However, all of these\ngroups are linked to the North\nKorean military apparatus, in particular to Bureau 121 of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, which\nleads most sources to amalgamate\nthem under a devoted name, Lazarus. Nevertheless, this concentration is detrimental to the analysis\ninsofar as the Lazarus prism leads\nus to consider that only one group\npursues the motivations of APT,\ncybercriminal, terrorist and hacktivist at the same time. We try as\nmuch as possible to specify the Lazarus sub-groups for adequate intelligence.\nAKT3 or Lazarus is not a single\nThreat Group. It represents the Bu\n\nBureaus associated to the Recon**naissance General Bureau. The**\nBureau 121 is the primary office tasked with cyber operations. It was\nreorganized in September 2016 and\nit is now composed of:\n\n**• Lab 110**\nIt is the key cyber unit under the\nRGB; it applies cyberattack techniques to conduct intelligence operations.\n\n**• Office 98**\nPrimarily collects information on\nNorth Korean defectors, organizations that support them, overseas\nresearch institutes related to North\nKorea, and university professors in\nSouth Korea.\n\n**• Office 414**\nGathers information on overseas\ngovernment agencies, public agencies, and private companies.\n\n**• Office 35**\nOffice concentrated on developing\nmalware, researching and analyzing\nvulnerabilities, exploits, and hacking\ntools.\n\n**• Unit 180**\nUnit specialized in conducting cyber operations to steal foreign money from outside North Korea.\n\n**• Unit 91**\n- focuses on cyberattack missions\ntargeting isolated networks, particularly on South Korea critical national infrastructure such as KHNP\nand the ROK Ministry of National\nDefense.\n\n- stealing confidential information\nand technology to develop weapons\nof mass destruction.\n\n**• 128 and 413 Liaison Office**\nResponsible of hacking foreign intelligence websites and train cyber\nexperts.\n\n**_The Bureau 121 conducted three**\n**main types of operations:**\n\n**• Cyber espionage: The Lazarus**\nUnits conducted multiple cyber\nespionage operations such as the\nKimsuki campaign and the Operation KHNP. These espionage\noperations have different objec\n\nKorean dissidents, the collection\nof intellectual properties helping\nthe development of weapons of\nmass destruction or political espionage.\n\n**• Cyber Terrorism: in 2013 North**\nKorea conducted disruptive attacks on South Korean media\nand financial companies (Operation DarkSeoul) and was responsible for the Sony hack link\nto the movie «The Interview» in\nNovember 2014. These attacks\noccured before the 2016 reorganization of the Bureau 121, that’s\nwhy we can’t tell which Unit is\ncurrently responsible of disruptive operations.\n\n**• Money theft: One of the mission**\nof the Bureau 121 is the collection\nof liquidity to finance these cyber\nactivities and the DPKR itself. It\nis done by spreading ransomware\nlike the infamous WannaCry\nwhich collected $91.000 through\nbank robbery. The cyber bank\nrobbery is done by infiltrating\nthe banking network to steal the\nSWIFT credentials and use these\ncredentials to initiate transactions to an account controlled by\nthe attacker. The most known is\nBangladesh Central Bank Heist in\nFebruary 2016 allowing the theft\nof $81m. This activity was carried\non by the Unit 180, which has similar objectives than the North\nKorean threat group APT38 aka\nStardust Chollima or BlueNoroff.\n\n**_The Bureau 121 is supported by**\n**other Units from the General Staff**\n**Department**\n\n**• The Operation Bureau**\ntasked to define cyber strategies\nand plan operations.\n\n**• The** **Command** **Automation**\n**Bureau**\ncomposed of three units:\n\n- Responsible for malware development (seems redundant with the\nOffice 35)\n\n- Unit 32: responsible for military\nsoftware development\n\n- Unit 56: responsible for command\nand control software development\n\n**• The Enemy Collapse Sabotage**\n**Bureau**\ntasked with information and psy\n\nA cyber operation involves the interaction of these different teams.\nFor example, the Operation Bureau\ndefines an objective, the Office 35\nfinds a useable exploit, the Unit 31\ndevelops the backdoor and the lure\ndocuments with the help of the\nEnemy Collapse Sabotage Bureau\nto create efficient spear-phishing\ndocument. The Unit 56 develops\nC2 software and maintains a C2\ninfrastructure which will be used\nby the Lab 110, Unit 180 or Unit 91\nto achieve the objective. Due to\nthis configuration, it is expected to\nfind tools and infrastructure overlap between the different operation\nunits.\n\n**_USED MALWARES**\n\n- CRAT\n\n- Dacls\n\n- MATA\n\n- TFlower\n\n- ThreatNeedle\n\n- Vyveva\n\n**_USED VULNERABILITIES**\n\n- CVE-2016-0034\n\n- CVE-2017-7269\n\n**_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON**\n\n**> October 2019: Attack on**\n**the Kudankulam Nuclear Power**\n**Plant in India**\n_Happened on: 2019-10-01_\n\n**> Operation In(ter)ception**\n_Happened on: 2019-09-01_\n\n**> Dream Job**\n_Operation Dream Job involves_\n_Lazarus using fake job offers as_\n_a means of luring victims into_\n_revealing sensitive information_\n_about the company, or clicking_\n_on malicious links or opening_\n_malicious attachments that_\n_eventually lead to the installation_\n_of malware used for espionage_\n_Happened on: 2020-08_\n\n**> Dream Job**\n\n\n**_USED VULNERABILITIES**\n\n\n**_USED MALWARES**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_MITRE ATT&CK[®] TECHNIQUES**\n**USED BY THIS ATTACKERS GROUP**\n\nT1003 -

The attacks of this adver-**\nsory are different from those seen\nin untargeted or targeted attacks,\nwhich makes it peculiar in many\nways. When part of the targeted\nattacks can be qualified as opportunistic: This group will prefer to\nmodify their target profiles and\ngeographic attack zones based on\ngeopolitical events.\n\nThus, no target is immune in the\nworld. ATK33’s objective will be to\nsteal sensitive intellectual property\nrelated to government interests,\nThe group has systematically targeted specific governments organizations, defense institutes, intelligence\nagencies, diplomatic institutions\nand telecommunications providers\nin South and Southeast Asia. The\nrecurrent use of spear phishing\ntactics (phishing attempts targeting\nspecific individuals) and access to\npreviously unknown zero-day exploits have made it a very resilient\nthreat.\n\nFor initial access it uses mainly\nspear-phishing, we have also seen\nthe use of nuisance attacks against\nvulnerable browser plugins. It uses\nseveral zero-day exploits suggesting that this is a well-resourced\ngroup. ATK33 is less prolific in the\nfield than ATK9 for example, but focuses on a small number per year\ntrying to hide its infections with\nself-removing malware and using\none-shot delivery servers. It often\ntargets the private email accounts\nof its victims and uses them to access the organization’s networks. It\nuses custom developed tools which\nare often updated to avoid detection. Its backdoors are configured\nto operate during the victim’s working hours to hide network traffic\nfrom legitimate traffic. Interestingly,\nthere is no code shared between\ntheir different backdoors.\n\nThe CnC infrastructure is a mixture of registered domains and free\nsubdomains obtained through dynamic DNS providers. The group\nuses compromised infrastructure\nbased in multiple countries.\n\n\nUsed lure documents often address\ncontroversial subjects to incite the\nreader to open them.\n\nBased on Microsoft’s investigations, here is a non-exhaustive list\nof ATK33 characteristics.\n\n- Implementation of several cyber\nespionage campaigns since at\nleast 2009.\n\n- Concentration on a small number of campaigns per year, which\nreduces the risk of detection and\nhelps the group to remain unnoticed and focused longer.\n\n- Targeting of governments and related organizations in South and\nSouth East Asia. Using multiple\nunpatched vulnerabilities in zero-day exploits against its victims.\n\n- Main method: Spear phishing\nHiding its traces by automatic\nremoval of malicious components or by using single mode\nserver-side logic where remotely\nhosted malicious components are\nonly allowed to load once.\n\n- Harassment of its targets via\ntheir unofficial or private email\naccounts, to use them as a\nspringboard to the planned organization’s network.\n\n- Use of malicious tools that are tailor-made and have the resources\nto update these applications often\nin order to avoid being detected.\n\n- Configuring its backdoor malware\nto restrict its activities to victims’\nworking hours, in an effort to disguise post-infection network activity from normal user traffic.\n\n- Its espionage activity is not intended to achieve direct financial\ngain, but rather uses stolen information for indirect economic\nbenefits.\n\n**_USED MALWARES**\n\n- ATMsol\n\n- Dipsind\n\n- Hot patcher\n\n- JPIN\n\n- adbupd\n\n\n**_USED TOOLS**\n\n\n\n- Living off the Land\n\n**_USED VULNERABILITIES**\n\n- CVE-2013-1331\n\n- CVE-2013-7331\n\n- CVE-2015-2545\n\n- CVE-2015-2546\n\n**_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON**\n\n**> 2012 -

Their malwares are compiled with Russian language setting and during the Russian office working hours. Despite\nnumber of public disclosure from\nEuropean governments and indictments from the U.S. Department of\nJustice, this adversary continues to\nlaunch operations targeting the political and defense sector in Europe\nand Eurasia.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2014, ATK5 had\nthree kinds of targets:\n\n- Georgian government agencies\n(Ministry of Internal Affairs and\nMinistry of Defense) or citizens\n\n- Eastern European governments\n\n- Security organisations\n\nThe attack of the Georgian Ministry\nof Defense can be a response to\nthe growing U.S.-Georgian military\nrelationship. In 2013, the group targeted a journalist which is a way to\nmonitor public opinion, spread disinformations or identify dissident.\n\nDuring 2015 and 2016, this group\nactivity increased significantly, with\nnumerous attacks against government departments and embassies\nall over the world.\n\nAmong their most notable presumed targets are the American Democratic National Committee, the\nGerman parliament and the French\ntelevision network TV5Monde.\nATK5 seems to have a special interest in Eastern Europe, where it\nregularly targets individuals and organizations involved in geopolitics.\nThey also have been implicated in\nthe U.S. presidential election attacks in late 2016.\n\nThe 2016 attacks were visible and\ndisruptive but in 2017 the group\noperated a great change to more\nstealthy attacks to gather intelligence about a range of targets.\n\nOne of the striking characteristics\nof ATK5 is its ability to come up\nwith brand-new zero-day vulnera\n\nexploited no fewer than six zero-day\nvulnerabilities. This high number of\nzero-day exploits suggests significant resources available, either\nbecause the group members have\nthe skills and time to find and\nweaponize these vulnerabilities, or\nbecause they have the budget to\npurchase the exploits. In addition,\nAPT28 tries to profile its target\nsystem to deploy only the needed\ntools. This prevents researchers\nfrom having access to their full\narsenal.\n\n**_USED MALWARES**\n\n- ADVSTORESHELL\n\n- Blitz backdoor\n\n- CORESHELL\n\n- Cannon\n\n- DealersChoice\n\n- Delphocy\n\n- Downdelph\n\n- Drovorub\n\n- HIDEDRV\n\n- JHUHUGIT\n\n- Komplex\n\n- LoJax\n\n- OLDBAIT\n\n- USBStealer\n\n- X-Agent\n\n- X-Agent for Android\n\n- XAgentOSX\n\n- XTunnel\n\n- Zebrocy\n\n**_USED TOOLS**\n\n- Forfiles\n\n- Koadic\n\n- Living off the Land\n\n- Mimikatz\n\n- Responder\n\n- Winexe\n\n- certutil\n\n\n**ATK5**\n(aka Sofacy, APT28) is a Russian\nstate-sponsored group of attackers\noperating since 2004, whose main\nobjective is to steal confidential infor-\nmation from political\nand military targets that benefit the\nRussian government.\n\n_Type of attacker: State Sponsored\n\n###### Alias_\n\n_APT 28 **NORTH AMERICA** **MIDDLE EAST/**\n_APT28 United States Of America **WESTERN ASIA**\n_Fancy Bear Canada Armenia\n_Group 74\n\n###### Azerbaijan\n\n_Group-4127\n_IRON TWILIGHT **SOUTH AMERICA** Georgia\n_Pawn Storm Brazil Iran\n_PawnStorm\n\n###### Turkey\n\n_SIG40\n_SNAKEMACKEREL **NORTHERN EUROPE** Saudi Arabiaz\n_STRONTIUM\n\n###### Sweden\n\n_Sednit\n_Sofacy Netherlands **CENTRAL ASIA**\n_Swallowtail Kazakhstan\n_TAG_0700 **WESTERN EUROPE** Tajikistan\n_TG-4127\n_Threat Group-4127 United Kingdom Of Great\n_Tsar Team Britain And Northern Ireland **SOUTH EAST ASIA**\n_TsarTeam France Malaysia\n_apt_sofacy\n\n###### Spain Germany EASTERN ASIA Belgium China\n Targeted Sectors_ EASTERN EUROPE JapanKorea\n Belarus Mongolia\n\n_Universities\n_Transportation Bulgaria\n_Think Tank Hungary **SOUTHERN ASIA**\n_Political Organizations\n\n###### Latvia Afghanistan\n\n_Media\n_International Organizations Ukraine\n_Hospitality Slovakia\n_High-Tech\n\n###### Poland Suspected origin\n\n_Healthcare\n_ Government Romania of the attacker_\nand administration agencies Montenegro\n\nRussia\n\n_Energy\n_Embassies\n_Defence\n_Defence contractors Languages_ Motivations_\n_Cybersecurity _Political Manipulation\n_Aerospace _Russian _Georgian _Espionage\n\n2008 2009 2010 2011\n\n2008-01-01 2008-01-01 2011-10-01\nCyber attacks Compromise of the Spearphishing of the\n\n\n**_USED MALWARES**\n\n\n-----\n\n**> September 2013: Spearphishing**\n**on Military officials**\n_Happened on: 2013-09-01_\n\n**> Late-2013: Targeting a**\n**Journalist Covering the**\n**Caucasus**\n_Happened on: 2019-07-01_\n\n**> Late-2013: Targeting an**\n**Eastern European Ministry of**\n**Foreign Affairs**\n_Happened on: 2013-07-01_\n\n**> January 2014: Spearphishing on**\n**Pakistanes military officials**\n_Happened on: 2014-01-01_\n\n**> May 2015: APT28 targets**\n**the Ukrainian Central Election**\n**Commission**\n_Happened on: 2015-05-01_\n\n**> August 2014: Attempt**\n**to compromise the Polish**\n**government**\n_Happened on: 2014-08-01_\n\n**> September 2014: Typosquatting**\n**of European defense exhibition**\n_Happened on: 2014-09-01_\n\n**> October 2014 -

Based\non a generally low level of coding\ncomplexity, CrowdStrike assesses\nthis adversary in terms of average\ntechnical sophistication.\n\n“The CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence team tracking of this adversary began in late 2016, when evidence of an attack surfaced against\na victim based in India and working\nin the hospitality sector. The attack\nused an Excel spreadsheet containing macro code that deployed the\npreviously mentioned simplistic\n.NET downloader payload. The basic nature of the malicious document and observed coding errors\nin the downloader payload are the\nbasis for the assessment that this\nactor demonstrates a low level of\ntechnical skills.\n\nMYTHIC LEOPARD was further observed in 2017 developing methods\nfor disguising custom malware implants. Two binder tools used to\ndisguise custom executables as legitimate Microsoft implants — were\ndiscovered by Falcon Intelligence\nand linked to MYTHIC LEOPARD in\nJuly 2017.\n\nSince April 2018, Falcon Intelligence has observed ongoing targeted intrusion activity using\nmalicious Microsoft Office Excel\ndocuments likely associated with\nthe MYTHIC LEOPARD adversary.\nAs part of this campaign, the adversary leveraged generic themes\nrelated to administrative, managerial or supervisory matters alongside a unique Visual Basic Script\n(VBScript) technique used for installation. Falcon Intelligence has\nobserved MYTHIC LEOPARD using\nthis technique for several years\nto install multiple first-stage implants and downloaders, including\nthe isqlmanager and Waizsar RAT\nmalware families. However, the use\nof the UPX packer and timestomping techniques have not previously\nbeen associated with this adversary\nand likely indicates an incremental\n\n\nincrease in tradecraft and sophistication.\n\nMYTHIC LEOPARD actors have\npreviously used an indigenously\nproduced .NET obfuscation tool to\nhide malware implants as legitimate\ntools. The malicious files visual_\nHD.exe and skypee.exe both attempt\nto impersonate a legitimate uTorrent executable once installed and\nrunning. Both malicious files use a\npreviously identified MYTHIC LEOPARD command-and-control (C2)\ndomain msupdate.servehttp[.]com.\nMYTHIC LEOPARD has previously\nreused old C2 domains across medium to long periods of time, despite operational security concerns.\n\nThe related decoy document in this\nattack simply displays a pay scale\nwithout any further identifying information. However, the filename\n(Pay Matrix Projected After 7th\nCPC (3).xls) suggests that it is related to India 7th Central Pay Commission recommendations for government salaries. As noted above,\nIndia is within the traditional target\nscope for this adversary.”\n\n**_USED MALWARES**\n\n- Crimson\n\n- ObliqueRAT\n\n- CapraRAT\n\n\n\n**> March 2020 - APT36 delivers**\n**CrimsonRAT with covid related**\n**phishing emails**\n_Happened on: 2020-03_\n\n**> March 2021 - ObliqueRAT**\n**targets South Asia**\n_Happened on: 2021-03_\n\n**> 2021 - TransparentTribe**\n**targeting India with evolving**\n**CrimsonRAT throughout 2021**\n_Happened on: 2021_\n\n**> Early 2022 - APT 36 Targeting**\n**Indian Government Officials via**\n**Spyware**\n_Happened on: 2022_\n\n\n###### Threat Actor_ Targeted Areas_\n\n**ATK64**\nA Pakistan-based adversary with\noperations likely located in Karachi.\nThis adversary uses social enginee-\nring and spear phishing to target\nIndian military and defense enti ties\n\n###### Alias_\n\n_APT 36\n_APT36\n_C-Major\n_Mythic Leopard\n_Operation C-Major\n_Operation Transparent Tribe\n_ProjectM **WESTERN EUROPE**\n_TMP.Lapis Germany\n_Transparent Tribe\n\n**>**\n\n###### MIDDLE EAST/ WESTERN ASIA\n Targeted Sectors_ Iran\n SOUTHERN ASIA\n\n_Military\n\n###### India\n\n_Defence\n\n###### Pakistan Afghanistan\n\n Suspected origin of the attacker_\n\nPakistan\n\n\n-----\n\n**_DESCRIPTION**\n\n\n**ATK66 - Reportedly, the group was**\nestablished in 2011, but became active starting from 2014, when the\nfirst attacks were detected in the\nwild.

The group entered the\npublic spotlight following the 2017\nhack of Larson Studios, and the\nsubsequent release of an entire season of the TV show “Orange is the\nNew Black”. “The Dark Overlord”\nkey business model is to hack into\nlow, medium and high-profile organizations, mostly in the healthcare,\neducation, and media production\nsectors in the US and the UK, and\nsubsequently put the stolen data up\nfor sale or demand ransom from its\nvictims. The Dark Overlord appears\nto primarily be a financially-driven\nthreat actor, with a proven history of success, and likely millions\nof dollars in profits. The threat actor has been prevalently active on\nDarknet marketplaces and hacking\nforums, where he tries to sell “private” databases (databases that are\nnot in the public domain yet), but\nalso other goods, such as software\nsource code.\n\nAlleged Members: arrested in September 2016.

But this article has\nbeen modified, maybe due to a mistake, and nothing remains but the\nCatchamas info stealer trojan. Because of these circumstances, the\ninformation presented here is with\nmoderate confidence.\n\nDuring the last wave of attack,\nwhich began in 2017, Thrip had targeted a satellite communications\noperator. The attack group seemed\nto be particularly interested in the\noperational side of the company,\nlooking for and infecting computers\nrunning software that monitors\nand controls satellites. This suggests to us that Thrip’s motives go\nbeyond spying and may also include\ndisruption.\n\nThe group uses several Live off the\n_Land tools. It uses administrations_\ntools available on the compromised\nmachine to reach its goal. This\ntechnique has multiple advantages:\n\n- Reduced costs and development\ntime of an attack.\n\n- The lack of custom malware\nmakes the intrusion difficult to\nattribute.\n\n- Usage of legitimate tools and legitimates protocol makes the detection of the intrusion difficult to\ndetect.\n\nATK78 uses PsExec, a legitimate\nMicrosoft Sysinternal for lateral\nmovement in the compromised\nnetwork. PsExec is used to install\nthe Catchamas trojan which allows\nthe adversary to steal information.\nThis malware is deployed on interesting compromised systems.\nSymantec identified three computers based in China used to launch\nthe attack. Thrip targeted a telecommunication satellite operator.\nIt seemed to focus on systems executing the software used to control\n\n\nobjective was the perturbation besides the espionage. In the same\nway, when the group targeted a\ngeospatial imaging organization, it\nfocuses on computers executing\nthe software \"MapXtreme Geographic Information System\", used\nto develop geospatial applications,\nGoogle Earth and Garmin imaging.\nThe group targeted three organizations from Southeast Asia in the\ntelecommunication sector and one\nin the defense sector. The nature of\nthe attacks indicates that these organizations were targeted, not their\nclients.\n\nGeographic targets and the kind\nof targeted entities indicate a correlation with PRC interests in the\ncontext of Sino-US tensions in the\nChina Sea especially with issues\nof sovereignty around Spratly and\nParacel islands. This suggests a direct link between Thrip Group and\nChinese institutions.\n\nThe group therefore appears to act\nbased on a strategic framework defined by the Party, but also on immediate contextual indications. The\ngroup’s nuisance capabilities and\nusual targets make it formidable.\n\nWe draw attention on the fact that\nwe have chosen to treat only the\ncase of the Thrip group under the\nATK78, some sources also link it to\nthe aliases Lotus Blossom, Lotus\nPanda, Spring Dragon. This state\nof affairs stems from the high level of sharing that exists between\nChinese attackers and the structure of their cyber service leading\nto confusion in their identification.\n\n**_USED MALWARES**\n\n- Catchamas\n\n- Hannotog\n\n- Mimikatz\n\n- Mycicil\n\n- Rikamanu\n\n- Sagerunex\n\n- Spedear\n\n- Syndicasec\n\n\n###### Threat Actor_ Targeted Areas_\n\n**ATK78**\nA Chinese cyber-espionage group\ntar geting telecommunications,\ngeos patial imaging and defense\nsectors in the United States and\nSoutheast Asia.\n\n_Type of attacker: State Sponsored\n\n###### Alias_\n\n_Thrip\n\n###### NORTH AMERICA\n United States Of America\n Targeted Sectors_\n\n_ Satellites\n\n###### SOUTH EAST ASIA\n\nand Telecommunications\n_Media Vietnam\n_High-Tech Philippines\n_Education\n_Defence\n_Communication **EASTERN ASIA**\n_Aerospace Taiwan\n\n###### Motivations_ Suspected origin of the attacker_\n\n_Information theft China\n_Espionage\n\n2018\n\n2018-01-01\nThrip targets Southeast Asia\n\n\n**_USED MALWARES**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_MITRE ATT&CK[®] TECHNIQUES**\n**USED BY THIS ATTACKERS GROUP**\n\nT1003 - OS Credential Dumping\nT1010 - Application Window Discovery\nT1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery\nT1036 - Masquerading\nT1047 - Windows Management Instrumentation\nT1048 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\nT1048.003 - Exfiltration Over Unencrypted/Obfuscated Non-C2 Protocol\nT1056 - Input Capture\nT1059.001 - PowerShell\nT1074 - Data Staged\nT1098 - Account Manipulation\nT1112 - Modify Registry\nT1113 - Screen Capture\nT1115 - Clipboard Data\nT1219 - Remote Access Software\nT1543.003 - Windows Service\nT1555.004 - Windows Credential Manager\nT1560 - Archive Collected Data\nT1564.001 - Hidden Files and Directories\nT1588.002 - Tool\n\n\n**USED BY THIS ATTACKERS GROUP**\n\n\n**_MITRE ATT&CK**\n\n\n\n**[®]**\n\n\n**RECONNAIS-** **RESOURCE** **INITIAL** **EXECUTION**\n**SANCE** **DEVELOPMENT** **ACCESS**\n\n\n**_CYBER ATTACK PHASES**\n\n\n**PERSISTENCE** **PRIVILEGE**\n**ESCALATION**\n\n\n**TECHNIQUES**\n\n\n**DEFENSE**\n**EVASION**\n\n\n**CREDENTIAL**\n**ACCESS**\n\n\n**DISCOVERY** **LATERAL**\n**MOVEMENT**\n\n\n**COLLECTION** **COMMAND** **EXFILTRATION** **IMPACT**\n**AND CONTROL**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_DESCRIPTION**\n\n\n**ATK8 - The group has been disco-**\nvered in March 2014 after the publication of a series of slides from\nEdward Snowden.

In a four\nyears period, the group improved\nfrom using open-source malwares such as njRat or Downloader\nto its own custom Android RAT,\nWindows RAT and JS backdoor.\nThis developpement indicated\nthat the group has ressources\nbut it used a small C2 infrastructure with 9 known C2 domains\nin the same period. Furthermore\nthis group on advanced phishing\ntechniques than exploiting sophisticated vulnerabilities.\n\nThis group attacks in waves :\n\n- October 2014 - July 2015 : Attacks against Syria using njRat\nand Downloader plus AndroRAT\nfor Android devices\n\n- July 2015 - November 2016 : Attacks using DarkComet, VBS\nBackdoor, AndroRAT and multiple\ntypes of payloads\n\n- December 2016 - July 2018 : Attacks using a custom Android\nRAT, a custom Windows RAT, a\nJavaScript Backdoor\n\nIn March 2019, the group started\nto use the WinRAR vulnerability\n(CVE-2018-20250) to install an\n\n\ncomputer. The language used in\nthe malwares and in the lure documents is Arabic. The lure documents are about terrorist attacks,\na sensible subject in the Middle\nEast region and other theme that\ncan easily lead to user curiosity.\n\n**Android RAT**\nThe Android RAT is an application\npretending to be «ChatSecure»,\n«WordActivation», «whatsappupdate_2017», and other common\nchat office software. It incites the\nuser to activate Android Device\nManager to protect itself from\nbeing easily uninstalled and hide its\nicon to run in background. After\nestablishing a connection with the\nC2 he wait for command and steal\ndata from WhatsApp, Viper and\nother softwares. It has the ability\nof recording, photographing, GPS\npositioning, uploading contacts/call\nrecords/sms/files, executing cloud\ncommands in xml format, etc.\n\n**Windows RAT**\nThis Windows RAT pretends to be\nthe Telegram chat application, using\nstrong phishing techniques (well\nchosen icons, names, well made interfaces) with a fake installation interface to lead the user to install the\nmalware and, if needed, malicious\nupdates.

However, along the years, the group has\nshifted to attack banks all over the\nworld such as in East Asia, Europe\nand more.\n\nThe group is known for their sophisticated and profound attacks,\nin which usually they take a long\nperiod of time to study the potential victim, to maximize the attack against them. In most cases,\nSpear-phishing emails were sent\nto bank employees, while having\na malicious file attached to them.\nThis usually downloaded the Silence Trojan that has many capabilities of stealing data, downloading\nadditional tolls, track victims and\nmore. A few versions of the toll\nwere found, and it has shown that\nthe group is continuing to enhance\nthem. Furthermore, the group uses\nmalwares to attack ATMs specifically, such as Atmosphere. At the\nbegenning, the tools used to target ATM were developped by other\ncyber criminals but the group is\ncurrently using homemade tools.\nThrough this, the group was able\nto steal millions of dollars in cash\nalong the years, mostly from banks\nin Russia, and Eastern Europe.\n\nSome IP addresses used during\ntheses attacks seems to be located\nin France, mostly from the OVH\nhoster.\n\nIn 2020 the group started to target Banks in Sub-Saharian Africa\nand to threaten Australian banks of\nDDoS attacks if they will not pay\nlarge sums in Monero cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to Group-IB the Silence\ngroup started to buy access from\n\n\nTA505 to banks which correlate\nwith the diminution of spear-phishing attempt from Silence.

The attacker’s tools and TTPs indicate\nthat he has prepared to conduct\noperations that can last several\nyears and require a long preparation. In the 2017 attack, the group\ncompromised the target’s network\nalmost a year before reaching the\nSIS (Safety Instrument System).\nDuring this period, priority seems\nto have been given to safety operational. His lack of curiosity during\nthe operation may indicate that the\nattacker is waiting for something\nbefore acting visibly.\n\n**Group description**\n\nTriton is a highly sophisticated\nmalware for manipulating the Industrial Control Systems (ICS) of\ncritical infrastructures discovered\nat the end of 2017. It is difficult to\ndetermine definitively the motivation\nbehind this campaign. According to\nseveral observers, the main objective of the campaign was to test the\ntools and refine the techniques.\n\nIt should be noted that according\nto Dragos, the ATK91 (Xenotime)\ngroup is probably one of the most\ndangerous groups known to date,\nsince it attacks industrial security\nsystems almost exclusively with\ndestructive intent resulting in loss\nof life. The Thales Cyber Threat Intelligence team shares this observation. Certainly, in its report of the\n66 most dangerous attackers in\nthe world, the Centre for Technical Threat Analysis ranks the group\nonly 30th with a score of 59 out\nof 100. This score means above\nall that the group does not represent a global threat to date, as it\nis extremely specialized and is not\nyet operational to our knowledge.\nHowever, the motivation and the\ntechnical level reached by ATK91\n(Xenotime), to compromise industrial control systems, makes it a\nformidable attacker whose attacks\ncan have serious consequences\non the security of people and infrastructures.\n\n\n**A particular international context**\n\nThis initial attack on Saudi interests by a group whose origin appears to be Russian is taking place\nin an unusual international context.\nIt should be recalled that since the\nend of 2017, Russia and Saudi Arabia\nhave been moving closer together\non the diplomatic front. However, if\nwe look at the sector targeted, namely oil, we must remember that\nsince 2014 and the annexation of\nCrimea, pressure from the West\non Russia has been added to the\nfall in world oil prices, which has\nplunged Russia into a recession. To\nstimulate investment, the Kremlin\nhad to find capital and foreign exchange. For this reason, Russia\nhas moved closer to Saudi Arabia, whose alliance with the United\nStates had weakened under the\nObama era in the alder of the Iranian nuclear agreement, supported\nby the former US President. On 1\nJanuary 2017, the two countries\ndecided to reduce oil production\nvolumes to 1.8 million barrels/day in\norder to increase the price of black\ngold. The attack on Triton at the\nend of 2017 took place 9 months\nlater, when King Salman travelled\nto Moscow (November 2017) to\nprepare for the next OPEC+ meeting, which was supposed to lead\nto a further reduction in production\nafter March 2018. Nevertheless, the\nlast 9 months have been marked\nby two important events that have\nredefined everyone’s interests. The\nchange in US position in favor of\nSaudi Arabia during the Trump era\nby denouncing the Iranian nuclear\nagreement and the Gulf crisis of\nJune 2017, which increased tension between the Kingdom and its\nShiite alter ego, weakened relations\nbetween Russia and the Saudis. After the meeting of the two leaders\nand the attack on Saudi Arabia that\nparalyzed its oil company, Triton\nlaunched new attacks in 2018 in\nthe Middle East region and against\nthe United States. Good relations\nbetween Saudi Arabia and Russia\nwere reconfirmed in the second\nweek of June 2018, when Saudi\nArabia and Russia agreed to stabilize oil prices at an average level\nof 75 dollars per barrel, while King\nBen Salman and President Putin\n\n\nning the Football World Cup, which\ntook place on the 14th.\n\nIt should be noted that according\nto Dragos, the Triton group (Xenotime) is undoubtedly one of the\nmost dangerous groups known to\ndate since it attacks industrial security systems almost exclusively\nwith destructive intent involving\nloss of human life.\n\n**Kill Chain**\n\nAt the end of 2017, an oil and gas\nfacility in Saudi Arabia experienced\ndowntime due to an infection with a\nstrain of malware capable of interfacing with the facility’s industrial\ncontrol systems. The malware was\ntargeted at Schneider’s Triconex\ninstrumented security system. Access to the system was achieved in\nthe classic way with phishing and\nhacking of the ID by changing the\ntelephone number to receive the\nSMS message giving the administrator password. The group then\ncompromised a system administrator workstation, after having laterally crossed the demilitarized zone\nconstituting the airlock between\nthe IT and OT network. The identifiers were then used to access and\ncompromise the SIS controllers.\nThe controllers were placed in Program Mode during their operation,\nallowing the attackers to reprogram\nthem. The attackers stayed for almost a year in the Triconex system\nengineering station. It was from this\nstarting point that they were able\nto send a Trojan horse to infect the\nmemory of the SIS controllers via\na zero-day operation allowing a privilege upgrade. From that point on,\nthe attacker had complete control\nof the plant. One year after the\nintrusion, on June 3, 2017, ATK91\n(Xenotime) went into attack mode.\nQuickly, the procedure for securing\nthe petrochemical plant was triggered and the temperature and pressure began to drop. The machines\nstopped in emergency. Two months\nlater, almost to the day, the same\nphenomenon occurred, suggesting\na major cyber-attack.\n\nIt is believed that on the first attempt the group inadvertently shut\ndown the plant, as some controllers\n\n\n###### Threat Actor_ Targeted Areas_\n\n**ATK91**\nThis group is known for the Tri-\nton malware. Triton is an attack\nframework allowing the manipula-\ntion of Security Systems, In dustrial\nControl Systems (ICS) of critical in-\nfrastructures, discovered at the end\nof 2017 when it has caused an acci-\ndental shutdown of the machines.\n\n###### Alias_\n\n_TEMP.Veles\n_TRITON group\n_XENOTIME\n\n###### MIDDLE EAST/ WESTERN ASIA\n Saudi Arabia\n Targeted Sectors_\n\n_ Energy\n\n###### Suspected origin of the attacker_\n\nRussia\n\n###### Motivations_\n\n_Sabotage\n_Espionage\n\n2017\n\n2017-01-09\nCampaign leveraging\n\n\n-----\n\nlogic code failed a validation check.\nThe protocol attacked by the group\nis proprietary, suggesting prior reverse engineering. In addition, the\ndevelopment of the tool would require access to both hardware and\nsoftware that are difficult to acquire.\nSuch an attack requires a high level of technical knowledge and, although it is unlikely to be reproducible on a large scale, it shows that\nthe attacker is sufficiently capable\nof attacking and potentially causing\nphysical damage to plants and industrial systems. The group would\nbe linked to the Central Scientific\nResearch Institute of Chemistry\nand Mechanics in Moscow for the\nfollowing reasons:\n\n- Personal links with that Institute,\n\n- An IP address used by the attacker,\n\n- Correspondence between business hours and working hours\nin Moscow.\n\nThis institution studies ways to\nprotect critical infrastructure\nand develops weapons and military equipment. The group has\nbeen using test environments to\ncheck the internal workings of its\nmalware since at least 2013. Other\nintrusions by this attacker into the\nMiddle East were carried out at\nundisclosed dates, focusing on oil\nand gas companies until the end of\n2018. It should be noted that the\ngroup has also begun probing energy systems in the United States\nand other countries.\nXenotime uses a dozen custom\nand public tools to carry out its\nattacks. The custom tools reimplement features of the public tools\nby adding anti-detection methods.\nThese tools appear to be used during critical phases of the intrusion.\n\nAttacks on industrial systems are\nlong (several months or years)\nsince they require learning how to\nexploit the target’s industrial process and developing the appropriate\ntools. The attack is therefore preceded by a discovery, learning and\npreparation phase during which\nthe attacker will set up his attack\ninfrastructure. The infrastructure\nuses VPS servers from international hosting providers (OVH or\nUK-2 Limited), VPNs and Dynamic DNS allowing regular changes\n\n\nthe target’s network, the attacker\nneeds to ensure persistent and\nvery discreet access throughout\nthe mission.\n\nXenotime therefore uses several\nmethods to hide its activities:\n\n- Renaming files to make them appear legitimate (using Microsoft\nUpdate file naming)\n\n- Use of standard tools simulating\nthe activity of an administrator\n(RDP, PsExec, WinRM)\n\n- Editing legitimate Outlook Exchange files to open web access,\n\n- Use of encrypted communication\nfor sending commands and programs\n\n- Use of multiple subfolders rarely\nused by users or programs,\n\n- Regular cleaning of attack tools,\nactivity logs, temporary files after\nuse\n\n- Changes to the dates contained\nin the files (creation and modification dates)\n\n- Use of VPN networks, allowing\nto hide the IP address of the attacker\n\nMalware persistence on compromised machines is achieved by\ncreating an Image File Execution\nOptions registry key or scheduled\ntasks. After reaching the targeted\nSIS controllers, the attacker focuses on deploying TRITON by limiting his activities to off-peak hours\nto avoid being discovered. TRITON\nthen allows full control of these\nsystems.\n\nThis modus operandi, largely based\non a concern for non-detection, allows us to draw two conclusions.\nFirstly, this line of development is\ntypical of state-sponsored attackers. The latter do not wish to be\nlinked to offensive computer systems with a geo-strategic dimension and demand that the groups\nfinance the greatest possible discretion. In the present case, the\nfact that the group is linked to a\nnational research institution and\nthat its modus operandi is devoted\nto destruction reinforces this hypothesis. The second conclusion that\ncan be drawn from this emphasis\non concealment is that it confirms\nthe non-operational nature of the\nattacker’s arsenal at the time of the\n\n\nas long as possible in the target’s\nsystems in order to increasingly\ntest his tool.\n\nThe case of this group shows that\nthe theory of security by darkness,\nwhich consists in thinking that an\nICS/SCADA system is complex and\ntherefore secure, no longer holds.\nThe rise in the quality of attacker\ngroups, the generalization of protocols and the standardization of systems have changed the situation.\n\n**_USED MALWARES**\n\n- Cryptcat\n\n- Mimikatz\n\n- SecHack\n\n- Triton/Trisis\n\n**_USED TOOLS**\n\n- Plink\n\n**_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON**\n\n**> Campaign leveraging the Triton**\n**malware**\n_Happened on: 2017-01-09_\n\n\n**_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON**\n\n\n**_USED TOOLS**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_MITRE ATT&CK[®] TECHNIQUES**\n**USED BY THIS ATTACKERS GROUP**\n\nT1003 - OS Credential Dumping\nT1021 - Remote Services\nT1021.001 - Remote Desktop Protocol\nT1027.005 - Indicator Removal from Tools\nT1036 - Masquerading\nT1048 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\nT1053 - Scheduled Task/Job\nT1059.001 - PowerShell\nT1070.004 - File Deletion\nT1070.006 - Timestomp\nT1074 - Data Staged\nT1078 - Valid Accounts\nT1087 - Account Discovery\nT1119 - Automated Collection\n\n\n**USED BY THIS ATTACKERS GROUP**\n\n\n**_MITRE ATT&CK**\n\n\n\n**[®]**\n\n\nT1133 - External Remote Services\nT1135 - Network Share Discovery\nT1505.003 - Web Shell\nT1546.012 - Image File Execution Options Injection\nT1560 - Archive Collected Data\nT1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment\nT1566.002 - Spearphishing Link\nT1571 - Non-Standard Port\nT1573 - Encrypted Channel\nT1583 - Acquire Infrastructure\n\n\n**_CYBER ATTACK PHASES**\n\n\n**RECONNAIS-** **RESOURCE** **INITIAL** **EXECUTION**\n**SANCE** **DEVELOPMENT** **ACCESS**\n\n\n**TECHNIQUES**\n\n\n**PERSISTENCE** **PRIVILEGE**\n**ESCALATION**\n\n\n**DEFENSE**\n**EVASION**\n\n\n**CREDENTIAL**\n**ACCESS**\n\n\n**DISCOVERY** **LATERAL**\n**MOVEMENT**\n\n\n**COLLECTION** **COMMAND** **EXFILTRATION** **IMPACT**\n**AND CONTROL**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_USED VULNERABILITIES**\n\n\n**_DESCRIPTION**\n\n\n**ATK92 - (aka: Gorgon Group, or**\nAggah) is engaged both in cybercriminal attacks as well as targeted attacks against worldwide\ngovernmental organizations.

This\npattern was echoed by TrendMicro, which identified civil society\nas the primary target of APT28’s\ndomestic operations\n\n\n\n- October 2018: Citizen Lab released\na report revealing that the Saudi\nArabian government had infected\nwith a spyware the phone of the\npolitical dissident Omar Abdulaziz. The spyware was identified as\n“Pegasus”, a product developed by\nIsraeli company NSO group\n\n- May 2021: High-profile targets\nwithin the Uyghur community in\nChina and Pakistan were targeted\nby a phishing campaign in which\nChinese hackers posed as the\nUnited Nations to trick users into\nopening a link that would install\na backdoor. The objective of this\ncampaign was cyber-espionage\nInterestingly, cyber attacks against\ncivil society receive little attention\nfrom leading CTI firms. This may\nbe due to the lack of financial resources for civil society to purchase threat intelligence. Therefore,\none should keep in mind that commercial threat reporting will tend\nto focus on sectors that can afford\nCTI services rather than segments\nthat cannot.\n\n\n###### _Civil Society\n\n\n**_MAIN THREAT VECTORS**\n\n\ngovernment organizations at only\n13%. While both government agencies and politically oriented NGOs\ncollect public policy information,\nthe lack of safeguards encourages\nthreat actors to prioritize targeting the latter civil society organizations. In 2019, Microsoft observed 740 intrusion attempts from\nnation-state actors targeting democracy-focused civil society organizations in the U.S.-including\npolitical parties and think tanks involved in the election process. The\nstructure of American civil society\nis interesting because organizations in this ecosystem are hailed\nas major players in the national\npolitical debate. This has prompted\nadversaries of the United States\n\n- namely China, Iran and Russia - to launch cyber operations\nto retrieve any sensitive political\ncontent that these organizations\nmay have. This includes projections on the leading policy issues\nas well as staff and contact information.\nChinese-affiliated actors have\nlaunched particularly aggressive\ncampaigns targeting U.S.-based\nNGOs working on issues related\nto human rights and democracy in China. In these campaigns,\nthe exfiltration of sensitive data\nhas not been limited to the NGO’s\n\n\n**_UNDERSTANDING**\n**THE CYBER THREAT**\n\nCivil society refers to non-profit,\ncitizen-based groups that are organized at the local, national or\ninternational level. These groups\ncan take a variety of forms, ranging from unions and communities to think tanks and NGOs. The\nvery nature of their activities (often related to the political sphere)\ncoupled with limited budgets\n(non-profit) to implement protective security measures make them\nan enticing target for malicious\nactors. This intuition is borne out\nin the wild as civil society organizations and faces a dense cyber\nthreat landscape, both in terms of\nnumbers and variety of threat actors. From a hacker’s perspective,\nthe Civil Society represents a rich\nenvironment as organizations process credit card data for donations\nand may store personal information or even IP data.\n\n**_CYBERTHREAT LANDSCAPE:**\n**NGOS AND CHARITIES**\n\nNGOs appear in many aspects as\nthe embodiment of the challenges faced by the Civil Society as\na whole. According to a survey\nconducted by the Institute for Cri\n\ntical Infrastructures over NGOs\nand NPOs, 50% of the respondents revealed they had been targeted by a ransomware and nearly\nhalf (49%) admitted they did not\nrely on a specific unit to deal with\ncybersecurity issues. This gap can\nbe explained in part by the participatory funding of these organizations and the prioritization of\nexpenditures towards operational\nneeds.\n\nLooking at charities, which are\ncritical in the civil society ecosystem, a few trends are worth noting. First, while many services\nhave gone digital, the rate of reporting cyberattacks has remained\nsteady. Just over one in four charities (26%) reported being the\ntarget of a cyberattack in 2020,\nand this trend seems to correlate\nwith the size of the organization,\nas 68% of very high revenue charities recorded at least one cyber\nincident. 80% of breaches involve\na phishing scheme.\n\n**_AN APPEALING TARGET FOR**\n**STATE ACTORS**\n\nAt 32%, NGOs represent the\nlargest sector targeted by nation-state nefarious activities,\nahead of professional services and\n\n\nprogramming but has included a\nwide range of internal information, including legal and research\nresources. This gave them a very\nclear picture of how these civil society groups operate.\n\n**_MAIN THREAT VECTORS**\n\n- Spear-phishing: use of spoofed\nemail address to send malicious\nURLS and ultimately gain credential access of employees\n\n- CEO fraud: combines spear-phishing and identity theft to lure\nnaïve employees into making\nmoney transfer. The associations Save the Children and\nRoots for Peace both lost more\nthan $1 million following a CEO\nfraud\n\n**_INTERFERENCES IN POLITI-**\n**CAL CAMPAIGNS**\n\nIt is undeniable that political campaigns represent an opportunity\nfor attackers seeking to undermine\n\n\n**CIVIL SOCIETY: DISSIDENTS,**\n\n\n**JOURNALISTS, MINORITIES**\n\n\n**_A BROADER DEFINITION OF**\n\n\n**THE CYBER THREAT**\n\n\n**CAL CAMPAIGNS**\n\n\n**Top 6 industry targeted** **Resources targeted by threat actors**\n**by nation-state actors** **in civil society organizations**\n\n\n**_INTERFERENCES IN POLITI-**\n\n\n**_UNDERSTANDING**\n\n\n###### 20%\nInternational\nCommunications\n\n###### 1% [Information Tech]\nDocuments\n\n###### 1% [Legal Records] 1% [Marketing]\n\n\n###### 5%\n\nHuman Resources\nRecords\n\n\n###### 10%\nInternational\norganizations\n\n###### 13%\nGovernement\n\n\n###### 7%\n\nInformation\ntechnology firms\n\n###### 7%\n\nHigher\neducation\n\n\n**_CYBERTHREAT LANDSCAPE:**\n\n\n###### 32%\nNGOs\n###### 31%\n\nProfessional\nservices\n\n\n**_AN APPEALING TARGET FOR**\n\n\n**STATE ACTORS**\n\n\n###### 27% 44% Business\n\nAccount /\nFinancial Records\n\n###### 1%\nCredential\n\n\n**NGOS AND CHARITIES**\n\n\n**Ohio church : April 2019**\nNear Cleveland, a church\nfell victim to a business\nemail compromise (BEC)\nscam, leading to a loss of\n$1.75 millions.\n\n\n**Royal Dublin Society (RDS) :**\n**February 2022**\nThe RDS systems were crippled by\na ransomware attack that affected\nthe confidentiality of personal\ninformation belonging to employees\nand exfiltrated by the attackers\n\n\n**Vietnamese Overseas Initiative for Conscience**\n**Empowerment (VOICE) : May 2021**\nVOICE fell off to a cyberattack allegedly perpetrated by\nATK17 (aka Ocean Lotus), a hacker group affiliated\nwith the Vietnamese government.\n\n\n**EU DisinfoLab: July 2021**\nEU DisinfoLab was targeted by a phishing\nscheme in an attack attributed to\nNobelium, the gang responsible for the\nSolarWinds cyberattack\n\n\n2019 2020 2021 2022\n\n\n2022\n\n\n2021\n\n\n**Philadephia Food Bank: December 2020**\nPhiladeplhia Food Bank, the region’s largest\nhunger relief organization lost $1 million to a\n\n\n2020\n\n\n**Volunteer Service Abroad : May 2021**\nVolunteer Service Abroad, the largest\ninternational development volunteer\n\n\n2019\n\n\n**Red Cross : January 2022**\nThe International Committee of\nthe Red Cross fell victim to a\n\n\n-----\n\n###### _Education\n\n\n**_OTHER MOTIVATION : USE**\n**CASE SHED LIGHTS ON ES-**\n**PIONAGE-DRIVEN PLAYERS**\n\nAs part of a campaign that begun\nin April 2017, cyberattacks from\nChinese attacker groups have targeted U.S. universities in an effort\nto collect military type intelligence.\nThe information sought was related\nto underwater technology and although no public notice has been\nissued, some institutions may have\nbeen compromised. This demonstrates the value of academic research for states seeking information of strategic interest. Between\n2013 and 2017, Iranian hackers had\nalready implemented a phishing\nscam to recover the passwords of\nhundreds of professors of American universities.\n\n**_CYBERATTACKS WITH SIGNI-**\n**FICANT CONSEQUENCES**\n\nFar reaching consequences often\narise from cyberattacks on the\neducation and research industry.\nThe NSW Department of Education was hit by a cyberattack in\nJuly 2021, provoking an utter paralysis of the education system. In\nJanuary 2022, Albuquerque Public\nSchools district fell off to a cyberattack. The attack forced the superintendent Scott Elder to announce\nthe cancellation of classes for two\ndays in a row. This affected 75,000\nstudents, or one in five school\nchildren in New Mexico. Likewise, a\nransomware attack forced Howard\nUniversity to cancel classes and\nshut down campus network in September 2021. Some organizations\nturn to another solution, paying\nthe ransom, thus having to bear a\nfinancial drop-off. The University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco decided\nto pay part of the ransom ($1,14 millions) demanded by the Netwalker\nextortion group in order to decrypt\ntheir system and recover their data.\nIn 2020, 77 individual cyber-extortion attacks affected nearly 1800\nschools and resulted in $6.6 billions\nof recovery costs alone.\n\n\n**PIONAGE-DRIVEN PLAYERS**\n\n\n**_EVIDENCE THAT EDUCATION**\n\n\n**CASE SHED LIGHTS ON ES-**\n\n\n**IS A TARGET FOR CYBER-**\n\n\n**CRIME**\n\n\n**_UNDERSTANDING**\n**THE CYBER THREAT**\n\nSchools and higher education institutions were among the most\npopular targets in 2021. According\nto Checkpoint, Education and Research was the industry most targeted by cyberattacks in 2021, with\norganizations facing 1605 security\n\n\n**_OTHER MOTIVATION : USE**\n\n\nattacks per week. This figure represents a 75% year-on-year surge.\nFor comparison, cyberattacks\nacross all industries have increased\nby 50% over the period. The reasons behind this growth appear\nas both structural (valuable user\ndata, chronic under-appreciation of\ncybersecurity), as well as cyclical\nwith the complex adaptation of pe\n\ndagogical methods to the COVID 19\npandemic. This combination of factors seems to explain why, despite\nthe sector facing major challenges\nsuch as a lack of staff and a lack\nof funding and resources, the prevalence of cyberattacks seems to\nbe increasing year after year, as\nbreaches in schools and higher\neducation are widely reported.\n\n\n**_EVIDENCE THAT EDUCATION**\n**IS A TARGET FOR CYBER-**\n**CRIME**\n\nThe NCSC (National Counterintelligence and Security Center) continues to respond to an increased\nnumber of ransomware attacks affecting education establishments in\nthe UK, including schools, colleges,\nand universities. Three reasons can\nbe put forward to explain the attractiveness of the sector for the\ncybercriminal ecosystem.\n\nFirst, universities and educational\ninstitutions hold valuable data that\ncan be mined. They have valuable\ninformation about students and employees, namely medical records, PII\n(personable identifiable information)\nand financial information.\n\nSecond, their attack surface has\ngrown rapidly over the past two\nyears. Most companies are increasingly adopting new cloud and digital platforms, allowing them to\nbe much more effective than in\nthe past. Educational institutions\nare no exception to this trend. Indeed, many had to react quickly to\nchallenging remote working conditions to add new capabilities for\nengaging learners and storing files.\nCOVID 19 in that regard created\navenues for hackers to exploit remote systems. The limited budgets\nof certain institutions and notably\npubic schools further contribute to\ntheir vulnerability.\n\nThird, paying ransom in the event\nof computer systems being encrypted by ransomware often appears\nto be the most viable option for organizations that cannot justify halting educational services.\n\nThese arguments are reflected in\nthe fact that 13% of educational\ninstitutions have experienced a ransomware attack. This compares to\n5.9% for government institutions\nand 3.5% for healthcare organizations.\n\n|ATK206|ATK17|ATK73|ATK129|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|ATK217|ATK18|ATK77|ATK130|\n|ATK219|ATK19|ATK78|ATK131|\n|ATK1|ATK27|ATK98|ATK133|\n|ATK2|ATK29|ATK101|ATK134|\n|ATK32|ATK40|ATK103|ATK135|\n|ATK35|ATK49|ATK109|ATK136|\n|ATK22|ATK51|ATK115|ATK137|\n|ATK9|ATK37|ATK121|ATK140|\n|ATK13|ATK55|ATK123|ATK142|\n|ATK15|ATK67|ATK127|ATK143|\n|ATK153|ATK157|ATK167||\n\n\n**THE CYBER THREAT**\n\n\n**Average weekly attacks per organization, by industry 2021, compared to 2020**\n\n\n**_UNDERSTANDING**\n\n\nEducation / Research\n\nGovernment / Military\n\nCommunications\n\nISP / MSP\n\nHealthcare\n\nSI / VAR / Distributor\n\nUtilities\n\nManufacturing\n\nFinance / Banking\n\nInsurance / Legal\n\nLeisure / Hospitality\n\nConsultant\n\nSoftware Vendor\n\nRetail / Wholesale\n\nTransportation\n\nHardware Vendor\n\n**Five key reasons why**\n**Education is a target for**\n**cybercriminals.**\n\n\n###### 1605\n\n\n(+75%)\n\n\n###### 1136\n\n\n(+47%)\n\n(+51%)\n\n(+67%)\n\n\n**FICANT CONSEQUENCES**\n\n\n###### 830\n\n\n**_CYBERATTACKS WITH SIGNI-**\n\n\n###### 1079\n\n 1068\n\n(+71%)\n\n(+18%)\n\n\n###### 778\n\n 736\n\n 704\n\n 703\n\n\n(+46%)\n\n(+41%)\n\n(+53%)\n\n\n###### 636\n\n\n(+68%)\n\n(+40%)\n\n(+73%)\n\n\n###### 595\n\n\n###### 576\n\n\n###### 536\n\n 526\n\n\n(+146%)\n\n(+39%)\n\n(+34%)\n\n\n###### 501\n\n\n###### 367\n\n\n(+34%)\n\n\nConfidential research\ndocuments\n\n\nDisgruntled\nemployees and\nstudents\n\n\nLack\nof preparedness\n\n\nStrong incentives Valuable user\nto pay a ransom data\n\n\n-----\n\n**_OTHER MOTIVATION : DIS-**\n**GRUNTLED EMPLOYEES/STU-**\n**DENTS**\n\nWith 20% of attacks being the\nwork of an internal actor, educational services are one of the sectors most affected by this threat.\nIt can result in DDoS attacks from\ndisgruntled students or staff.

Other operators do not\nabide by those strict principles and\ncontemplate the sector as an easy\ntarget. In March 2021, the FBI issued a FLASH, a document alerting\neducation institutions of the surge\nof attacks directed at the sector by\nthe actor dubbed PYSA. The Grief\nransomware is another cyber-extortion actor targeting education\ninstitutions.

Its\nactivity is similar to MEGACORTEX version 2 which appeared in\nmid-2019\n\n- It checks for the existence of a\nMutex value, «EKANS», on the\nvictim\n\n- If present, the ransomware will\nstop with an «already encrypted!» message and if present the\nencryption proceeds using standard encryption library functions\n\n- The main functionality on victim systems is achieved via WMI\n(Windows Management Instrumentations) calls\n\n- Before data encryption: EKANS\nstops the processes listed by process name in a hard-coded list in\nthe malware’s coded strings for\nthe majority of listed processes,\ndatabases, data backup solutions\n\n\nor ICS-related processes\n\n- After that EKANS displays a ransom note\n\n**_ICS SYSTEMS:**\n\n- IIT-focused ransomware could\nimpact control system environments if it could migrate to Windows parts of control system\nnetworks, thus disrupting operations\n\n- EKANS modifies this narrative\nseen above as ICS-specific functionality is directly referenced in\nthe malware\n\n- Some of these processes may\nreside in typical corporate computer networks, such as :\n\n- Proficy servers or Microsoft SQL\nservers\n\n\n**_USE CASE 2: ENEL GROUP :**\n\n\n**SYSTÈMES ICS**\n\n\n**_ICS SYSTEMS:**\n\n\n**Programming language**\n\n\n**RANSOMWARE:**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### _Financial\n\n\n**Your identity is a steal on the Dark Web**\n\n**Social security** **Online payment** **Credit or debit card**\n**number** **services login info** (credit cards are more popular)\n(e.g. paypal)\n\n**$1** **$20-$200** **$5-$110**\n\n**Drivers license** **Loyalty accounts** $5 $15 $30\n\nWith CVV With bank Fullz info[*]\nnumber info\n\n**General non-financial institution**\n**logins**\n\n**$20** **$20**\n\n**Diplomas** **Passeports (US)** **$**\n\n**$1**\n\n**Subscription**\n**Medical records**\n**services**\n\n\n**_UNDERSTANDING**\n**THE CYBER THREAT**\n\nFinancial institutions are leading\ntargets of cyber attacks. Banks\nare where the money is, and for\ncybercriminals, attacking banks\noffers multiple avenues for profit\nthrough extortion, theft, and fraud.\nNation-states and hacktivists also\ntarget the financial sector for political and ideological motivations. Regulators are taking notice, and implementing new controls for cyber\nrisk to address the growing threat\nto the banks they supervise.\n\n**_WHO IS BEHIND**\n**THE THREAT?**\n\nThe malicious actors behind these\nattacks include not only increasingly daring criminals, such as the\nCarbanak group, which targeted\nfinancial institutions to steal more\nthan $1 billion during 2013-18, but\nalso states and state-sponsored attackers (see table). North Korea, for\nexample, has stolen some $2 billion\nfrom at least 38 countries in the\npast five years.\nFinancial services companies are\n\n\nwell aware of the problem and are\nworking hard to combat cybercrime, but huge amounts of money are still being siphoned off every year by cybercriminals ($4.2B in\n2020 according to the FBI).\nState-sponsored adversaries may\nattack the financial services sector to the extent that it disrupts\nan activity essential to the functioning of a state. In 2020, New\nZealand stock exchange was halted\nby a DDoS cyber attack, disrupting\nduring two days the cash and debt\nmarket.\nIn summary, the motivations of\nthe attackers can be divided into\nseveral categories: purely financial\n(96%), espionage (3%) grudge (2%),\nFun (1%), ideology (1%).\n\n**_THE CYBERTHREAT SITUA-**\n**TION**\n\nIn the financial sector, in 51% of\nthose cases, the attackers succeeded in encrypting company data.\nBut 62% of victims said they were\nable to restore fully from backups,\nand only 25% paid a ransom, the\nsecond lowest payment rate of all\nindustries surveyed, 7% below the\naverage.\n\n\nIn 2021, 44% of the breaches in\nthis vertical were caused by Internal actors (having seen a slow but\nsteady increase since 2017) (Figure\n2). The majority of actions performed by these individuals are accidental actions, including sending\nemails to the wrong people, which\naccount for 55% of all error-based\nbreaches (and 13% of all breaches\nfor the year).\n\n**_COST OF RANSOMWARE AT-**\n**TACK IN FINANCIAL SECTOR**\n\nAs shown in figure 3, healthcare,\nenergy and financials services and\npharmaceuticals experienced an\naverage total cost of a data breach\nsignificantly higher than less regulated industries such as hospitality,\nmedia and research. This can also\nbe explained by the value of the assets detained by financial services.\nIndeed, bank account and credit\ncard number are high value commodities for cybercriminals looking\nto monetize information on Dark\nWeb forums.\nCyber-extortion actors have understood that well and often target financial institutions speci\n\nfically. Banco BCR, the largest\nstate-owned commercial bank of\nCosta Rica was hit twice by Maze\noperators in a one-year span. The\nMaze team boasted about having\nexfiltrated over 11 millions credit card\ncredentials.\n\n**_CNA FINANCIAL HIT BY A**\n**CYBERATTACK**\n\nIn March 2021, the Chicago-based\ninsurance company CAN Financial fell victim to an attack by ransomware. The attackers masqueraded the malware as a fake browser\nupdate to gain initial access to the\nsystem. More than 15,000 servers\nwere encrypted by the Phoenix Locker, a malware officially developed\nby the Phoenix threat actor but\nbelieved to have a connection with\nEvil Corp. Sensitive personal information (SSN, medical records, etc.)\nwas stolen by the attackers and\nthe 7th largest insurance company\nin the US decided to pay off the\namount of the ransom, which, at\n$40 millions, is the highest amount\never recorded.\n\n**_LARGE-SCALE FRAUDS**\n\nThreat actors are increasingly turning to large-scale frauds, targeting directly banks networks rather\nthan relying on stolen payment information in order to achieve fraudulent transaction. One player that\nillustrates this trend is the Lazarus\nGroup. Affiliated to North Korea, the\ngroup has pioneered the targeting of\nSWIFT terminals. SWIF is a messaging network providing financial\ninstitutions with a secure place to\nperform monetary transactions.\n\n\n**_CNA FINANCIAL HIT BY A**\n\n\n**THE CYBER THREAT**\n\n\n**CYBERATTACK**\n\n\n**$100-$400** **$1000-$2000**\n\n\n**_UNDERSTANDING**\n\n\n**$1-$10** **$1-$1000[**]**\n\n\n**TACK IN FINANCIAL SECTOR**\n\n\n\n - Fullz info is a bundle of information that includes a «full» package for fraudsters: name, SNN,\nbirth date, account numbers and other data that make them desirable since they can often do a\nlot af immediate damage.\n** Depends on how complete they are as well as if ot a single record or an entire database.\nNote: Prices can vary over time and prices listed below are an estimation and aggregation based\non reference articles and hands on experience of Experian cyber analyst the last two years.\n\n**Actors in Finance breaches over time**\n\n\n**_THE CYBERTHREAT SITUA-**\n\n\n**_LARGE-SCALE FRAUDS**\n\n\n**THE THREAT?**\n\n\n**Attackers known to have targeted the financial sector**\n\nATK243 ATK157\n\nATK206 ATK2\n\n\n**_WHO IS BEHIND**\n\n\n**Cost of data leaks in the finance sector**\n\nMeasured in\nUS$ millions\n\n###### Healthcare $7.13 Energy $6.39 Financial $5.85\n\n\n**_COST OF RANSOMWARE AT-**\n\n\n-----\n\nnancial constraints. A 2020 study\nshowed that 97% of city employees\ntransfer sensitive documents via\ntheir email boxes. Finally, the criticality of certain operations performed by local makes them prone\nto paying ransomware to ensure\nbusiness continuity. In 2018, Iranian hackers launched a massive\nransomware attack against city\ncomputer networks. The scale of\nthe incident created a disruption in\nthe operation of law enforcement,\ncourt processing boxes, payment of\nparking tickets and a halt in operations at Hartsfield-Jackson airport.\nThe city of Baltimore also fell victim to ransomware attacks in 2018\nand 2019, causing server paralysis\nand disruption to its 911 emergency call center. A coordinated ransomware attack also targeted 22\nsmall towns in Texas, resulting in\nransom payments of hundreds of\nthousands of dollars.\n\n\n###### _Government\n\n\n**_UNDERSTANDING**\n**THE CYBER THREAT**\n\nFor several years now, the strategic risks for the security of France,\nEurope and, more generally, the\nWest, have changed in nature and\nintensity. Today, the monopoly of\nviolence escapes the States and\nwar has become hybrid: civil and\ninterstate, internal and external,\nmaterial and immaterial. This observation applies particularly to cyber attacks. These transformations\nare profoundly disrupting democracies, their values and their institutions. Many governments, particularly in Europe, have had to face a\nmuch more dangerous cyber threat\n\n\nlevel are the highest-ranking Defence staff who are most qualified\nto protect the public. Yet, through\nunderinvestment, lack of awareness, rapid technological advancements in hacking software and any\nnumber of factors, cyber attacks\non military weapons are an increasingly prevalent threat.\nIndeed, many weapons or the systems that control them are vulnerable to some form of cyber attack.\nThese attacks can occur without\nthe military teams controlling the\nweapons being aware of them.\nThese weaknesses have been referred to as ‘critical cyber vulnerabilities’. For five years, US Department\nof Defense testers have routinely\ndiscovered these vulnerabilities in\nalmost every weapon system under\ndevelopment or in circulation.\nThis is made possible by a large\nnumber of advanced weapons systems developed by private companies, which have factory-defined passwords on arrival. These\npasswords have remained un\n\nchanged, allowing them to be easily found online. Vulnerabilities\nfound in military systems included\nthe ability to turn a weapon on or\noff, affect missile targeting, adjust\noxygen levels or manipulate what\ncontrollers see on their computer\nscreens. All would be devastating in\na real combat operation and could\nresult in loss of life.\n\n**_LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES**\n\nAs local governments and municipalities have gone increasingly digital and process more and more\ndata, they have become attractive\nto cybercriminals. Indeed, these\nlocal entities combine two central\nelements that make them particularly appealing to malicious adversaries: the possession of high-value\ndata that can be used in identity\ntheft, including tax records that\ncompile PII, and the magnitude of\nvulnerabilities that are the result of\nthese organizations’ underinvestment in their IT security due to fi\n\ntargeting the very institutions of\nthose states and jeopardizing the\nproper functioning of the targeted\ngovernments.\n\n**_PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION**\n\nWhen it comes to governments,\nit is necessarily appropriate to talk\nabout public administrations.

This has been\nparticularly noticeable with many\ninstitutions in the health sector\nfalling victim to numerous groups\nof attackers:\n\n- Hackers managed to penetrate the\nsystem of one of the largest test\ncentres of Covid-19 in Antwerp,\nBelgium. While its network was\nstill offline on Tuesday, the laboratory refused to pay the ransom\nand filed a complaint.\n\n- The European Medicines Agency\n(EMA), which is responsible for\nreviewing the dossiers of candidate vaccines, was hit by a cyber attack. Scientific data on the\nPfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the first\ntreatment on the market, was accessed by the criminals.\n\n- On 15 September, the Paris Hospitals (AP-HP) reported that the\npersonal data of 1.4 million people\nwho had undergone Covid screening tests in the Ile-de-France region in mid-2020 had been stolen\nduring the summer. E-mail, telephone number, address, social\nsecurity number and test results\nwere found in the wild and on\ndark web sites.\n\n**_THE INTERNET OF MEDICAL**\n**THINGS (IOMT)**\n\nIn order to improve efficiency and\nperformance, many hospitals are\nequipped with connected devices\n(15 to 20 in one hospital room on\naverage). Some of them, such as\nultrasound scanners and physiological monitors, are connected to\nboth the Internet and the hospital’s\ncomputer network, thus providing\nan entry point for an attacker. Internet of Things devices have many\nintrinsic vulnerabilities, are rarely\nprotected by antivirus software and\nare not regularly updated, which explain why they are exploited by malicious actors.\n\n\n**_COVID-19 AND THE HEALTH**\n\n\n**SECTOR**\n\n\n**_UNDERSTANDING**\n**THE CYBER THREAT**\n\nHealthcare organizations are increasingly exposed to online attacks, threatening daily work and\ncompromising confidential patient\ndata. It has become apparent from\nthe many attacks that have occurred in recent years that healthcare\nstaff does not have the time or resources to minimally counter the\nattacks. The potential disruption\ncaused by a complete overhaul of\nonline security is simply too great\nfor many organizations to even\nconsider. Despite the willingness of\ngovernments to successfully limit\nthe number of attacks on critical\ninfrastructure, new threats continue to be discovered every day. The\nhigh demand for patient information and often outdated systems\nare among the many reasons why\nthe healthcare sector is now the\nmain target for online attacks.\n\n**_CYBERTHREAT SITUATION**\n\nSince 2019, the healthcare sector\nhas seen a shift from breaches\ncaused by internal actors to primarily external actors. It brings this\nvertical in line with the long-term\ntrend seen by other industries.\nWhile one of the primary concerns\nin the healthcare industry remains\nmiscellaneous errors, with delivery\nmistakes being the most common\nincident (36% of human error),\nthese are not intentional in nature.\nAs a matter of fact, malicious insider breaches have not been among\nthe top three trends in the healthcare industry for several years.\nWhile basic human error continues\nto plague the healthcare industry,\norganized cybercriminal groups\nwith a financial motivation continue to target it, with ransomware\ndeployment a preferred tactic.\n\n\n###### _Health\n\n**_HEALTHCARE**\n**CYBERSECURITY STATISTICS**\n\n - Ransomware attacks have hit\n34% of healthcare organizations\nin 2021[ 1]\n\n - The Secretary of U.S. Department\nof Health and Human Services\n(HHS) Breach of Unsecured Protected Health Information lists\n592 breaches of unsecured protected health information affecting 500 or more individuals that\nare currently under investigation\nby the Office for Civil Rights. 306\nof the breaches were submitted in\n2020 alone.\n\n - From 2017 to 2020, more than\n93 percent of healthcare organizations have experienced a data\nbreach and 57 percent have had\nmore than five data breaches during the same time frame.\n\n - The average bill to recover from\na ransomware attack was $1.27\nmillion in 2021, the lowest of any\nindustry over the year.\n\n - Data compromised: Personal\n(66%), Medical (55%), Credentials\n(32%), Other (20%), (breaches)\n\n - Actors motivations: Financial\n(91%), Fun (5%), Espionage (4%),\nGrudge (1%) (breaches)\n\n**_THE RANSOMWARE**\n**ATTACKS ON HOSPITALS**\n**AND HEALTHCARE**\n\nBetween 2020 and 2021, France\nrecorded 27 major cyberattacks on\n\n\n**AND HEALTHCARE SERVICES**\n\n\n**_CYBERTHREAT SITUATION**\n\n\n**_UNDERSTANDING**\n\n\nRansomware attack\nagainst Dax Hospital\n\nRansomware attack\nagainst VillefrancheS ô H it l\n\n\nhealthcare institutions.

In addition, API misconfiguration issues were involved\nin nearly two-thirds of studied incidents. This targeting coincided with\na robust underground marketplace\nfor cloud-related credentials, with\n\n\n**_UNDERSTANDING**\n**THE CYBER THREAT**\n\nThe high tech and IT sector’s relevance to economic, intelligence,\nand security concerns likely make\nit a target for a variety of threat\nactors. The high-tech sector is often ground zero for cyberattacks.\nOne obvious reason is that these\norganizations have very valuable information to steal. However, another more subtle reason is the very\nnature of high-tech organizations.\nHigh-tech companies generally\nhave a higher risk appetite than\ntheir counterparts in other industries. In addition, they tend to be\nearly adopters of new technologies that are still maturing and are\ntherefore particularly vulnerable to\nattacks and exploits. Parts of the\nhigh-tech sector provide a path of\nattack to other sectors, as hightech products are a key part of\nthe infrastructure for all kinds of\norganizations.

Besides, the very\nnature of this industry makes them\nprime candidates for ransomware\nattacks, as they handle large volumes of sensitive data (confidential information related to mergers\nand acquisitions, documents under\nprofessional secrecy) that threat\nactors perceive as valuable. This\ncombination of factors opens the\ndoor to cyberattacks by groups\nwith primarily financial objectives.\n\n**_CYBER-EXTORTION AND**\n**LEGAL SECTOR**\n\nThe nature of cyber-extortion has\nchanged in recent years, from an\necosystem dominated by the use of\nransomware as both a data encryption and ransom negotiation tool to\nan environment where operators\nuse various blackmail techniques,\nsometimes not even encrypting the\ndata. This new tactic, often referred as double-extortion reflects a\n\n\n###### _Legal\n\nreality : for some companies, the\npossibility of having their sensitive\ndata published is a greater risk than\nhaving their servers paralyzed. This\nobservation applies to companies in\nthe legal sector for two main reasons.\nFirst, a law company whose name\nand sensitive documents were\nleaked by a cyber-extortion gang\nwill suffer from reputational damage as clients will move away\nfrom the firm. A law company loses\non average 5% of their clients after\na data breach.\n\nSecond, for European firms, the\nprovisions of the GDPR (General\nData Protection Regulation) provides for fines up to 4% of the company’s turnover in case of dissemination of confidential content.\n\nDespite the uncertainty of negotiating with cybercriminals, those elements may explain why some law\nfirms decide to pay the ransom.\n\n\n**_RANSOMWARE AND LEGAL**\n\n\n**_CYBER-EXTORTION AND**\n\n\n**SECTOR: USE CASE**\n\n\n**_UNDERSTANDING**\n\n\n**Number of targets per ransomware** **Number of legal services victim organization**\n**between Feb 202 and May 2021** **(Feb 2020 – May 2021)**\n\n\n**_EVOLUTION OF THE RAN-**\n\n\n**SOMWARE THREAT**\n\n\n**High-Profile Ransomware Attacks on legal sector**\n\n\n**THE CYBER THREAT**\n\n\nSodinokibi\nNetWalker\nMaze\n\nEverest\nEgregor\n\nDoppelPaymer\nDarkSide\nConti\nClop\n\nAvaddon\n\n\n**LEGAL SECTOR**\n\n\n**4 New Square: June 2021**\n4 New Square is a London-based\ncommercial barristers’ (lawyers)\nChambers.

This attack led\nto a paralysis of servers, leading\nto the suspension of production\nlines, particularly in Australia and\nthe United States, where several\nslaughterhouses suspended their\nactivities. This attack is a landmark\nfor the manufacturing industry as\nJBS supplies almost a quarter of\nthe world’s meat. This incident resulted in a $11 million ransom being\npayed to REvil’s operators.\n\n\n**_MANUFACTURING SECTOR**\n**AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUC-**\n**TURES**\n\nThe critical manufacturing sector\nis particularly at risk of being targeted by malicious actors. In December 2021, the CISA released a\nreport tackling the issue and providing insights on the evolution of\nthe cyberthreat for this sector. In\nparticular, the CISA has identified\nvulnerabilities in ICS (Industrial\nControl Systems) that are even\nmore crucial with the COVID pandemic forcing companies to adapt\nto remote working. Managing cybersecurity risks has become more\ncomplex, as companies are incited\nto resort to process automation.\nICS play a key role in the securization of critical infrastructure, notably with regards to energy-related\ninfrastructure.\n\n\n**_UNDERSTANDING**\n**THE CYBER THREAT**\n\nThe manufacturing sector, due\nto the nature of its activities, has\nlong been kept away from the prerogatives of protecting computer systems. The reason for this\nis twofold: first, manufacturing\ncompanies have long been able to\noperate disconnected from the Internet and second, the general perception was that hackers were not\ninterested in the information and\nassets owned by manufacturing\norganizations. The emergence of\nIndustry 4.0 and the need for manufacturing companies to connect\ntheir industrial control systems\n(ICS) to the Internet has challenged\nthis paradigm. Thus, the novelty of\nthe emergence of network protection issues for these companies is\naccompanied by a gap compared to\nother sectors. This multiplies the\nopportunities for intrusion by malicious actors, which can leverage\nIntellectual property (IP) assets in\norder to generate income.\n\n**_THE STATE OF THE THREAT**\n**IN THE MIDST OF COVID 19**\n\nThe manufacturing sector was particularly affected by the global COVID19 pandemic and continues its\nrise among the sectors most affected by cyberattacks. According to\nthe 2021 Global Threat Intelligence\nReport (GTIR), the sector has become the second most impacted\nby cyberattacks, behind finance\n\n\nand insurance, with a rise of 300%\nin a year (2020 to 2021). A study\nconducted by Deloitte also shows\nthat nearly 40% of manufacturing\ncompanies have suffered a cyber\nattack this year and that among\nthese companies, 38% have experienced a loss of over 1 million dollars. Critical manufacturing firms\ninvolved in the vaccine cold chain\nwere targeted by a phishing campaign in a larger effort to gain access to sensible information pertaining to the COVID 19 vaccine.\n\n**_THE MOST COMMON**\n**THREATS FOR MANUFACTU-**\n**RING COMPANIES**\n\nPhishing and Ransomware seem\nto be the most common types of\nthreats targeting companies operating in the manufacturing sector.\nPhishing techniques (represent\n75.4% of social engineering attacks\n\n\nconducted for this sector) are the\nmost common vector used to gain\ninitial access along with the use of\nstolen credentials. The lack of preparation of the sector explains the\nvulnerability of the industry to phishing attacks.\nRansomware operators and more\nbroadly cyber-extortion actors target heavily the manufacturing companies. Figures show that 92% of\nthe attackers targeting the sector\nare financially motivated. Manufacturing companies have a particular incentive to pay large ransoms\ninsofar as a downtime would be\ndetrimental to their activity. As a\nresult the cost-effective option is\noften the payment of the ransom.\nIn 2021, the manufacturing industry is the sector most represented\namong cyber-extortion victims,\nwith more than 350 enterprises in\nthe ransomware leaks for the year.\n\n\n**_OTHER COMMON THREATS**\n\n- Manufacturing ranks 5th among\nsectors with the highest risk\nof internal threat. Employees\nworking in the sector are often\nuntrained and thus considered as\nweak links that can be leveraged\nby hackers. Malicious insiders are\nalso common in manufacturing\norganizations, whether they are\nafter a fincancial or personnal objective.\n\n- Manufacturing companies represent 22% of cyber espionage victims according to Verizon.

While\nsmaller retailers have moved to\ncard payments and online operations, larger retailers have focused\non harnessing big data to achieve\nefficiencies and maximize profit\nmargins.\nThis has introduced new threat\nvectors as retailers’ attack surfaces\nhave expanded, and these vectors\nare being exploited by cybercriminals keen to steal money and confidential financial information. Data\nis the new currency for cybercriminals, who focus not just on money and goods but also customers’\npersonal data that can be stolen\nand sold online.

They have become an essential element for the\nsuccessful accomplishment of military missions.\nNevertheless, for a number of\nyears, and especially with the onset\nof the New Space, the issue of cybersecurity in space systems has\nbeen sidelined, if not completely\nignored. The reasoning was that\nsince cyber attack techniques were\nnot as developed as they are today,\nthe functional and budgetary priority was not necessarily allocated\nto the issue of cyber security.\n\n\n**_VULNERABILITIES IN SPACE**\n**SYSTEMS**\n\nThe Space industry is organized\naround several segments:\n\n- Ground Segment\n\n- Link Segment\n\n- User Segment\n\n- Space Segment\n\n**_GROUND SYSTEM**\n\nCompromising the ground station\nis ultimately the easiest way to\ncontrol a satellite because it provides the equipment and software\nto legitimately control and track it.\nBesides, it uses existing and established ground systems and attack\nvectors. The types of threats are\ngenerally the same throughout the\nlife cycle of a satellite.\n\n\n**_VULNERABILITIES IN SPACE**\n\n\n**_UNDERSTANDING**\n\n\n**_SPACE SEGMENT**\n\n\nOnce in orbit, a satellite has limited\nphysical contact with humans, although this does not mean that\nsecurity threats are not present.\nVulnerabilities in the software and\nhardware used the satellite can\narise and impact the operation of\nthe satellite and the robustness of\nsecurity controls\n\n**_USER SEGMENT**\n\nCompared to the Link Segment\nwhich corresponds to the interactions between the three segments,\nthe User Segment deals with the\napplications of satellite systems.\nApplications such as navigation, television and communications often\n\n\nrequire dedicated hardware. Other\nsystems use the data collected by\nthese dedicated receivers to serve a\nspecific product or application. For\nsatellite television transmissions,\na satellite dish and decoder must\nbe installed to receive the channels\nprovided and to perform the subsequent tuning and decoding of the\nbroadcasts for viewing.\n\n**_EACH SEGMENT IS A POTEN-**\n**TIAL THREAT SURFACE**\n\nWhen we talk about threats to the\nspace sector it is first important\nto recall the different dimensions\nof the threat surface created by\nthe sector’s morphology. In reality\n4 segments are to be identified:\nspace, ground, link, and user.\nIn the following section, we will\nprovide examples to explain the\nways in which attackers have found\nto target these specific segments.\nThese examples focus mainly on\nuse cases of state-sponsored attacker groups, but they should not\nsuggest that organized cybercriminal gangs are not capable of acting\non these threat surfaces.\n\n|Upload of wro|ng Ephemeris|\n|---|---|\n\n|System intrusion from External Entity|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n\n###### TELECOMMUNICATION MISSION\n\n**Malicious software**\n**onboarding** **Satellite Control Segment**\n\nISL\n\n**Link Interception**\n\nISL **High jacking of Command and Control** **Upload of wrong Ephemeris**\n\nPlatform cmd/ctrl\n\nPayloand cmd/ctrl\n\nUser\ntraffic\n\n**Telecom Mission Segment**\n\nUser User\ntraffic traffic **Teleport**\n\nSatellite\nTelecommands\n& telemetries\n\n**Users** monitoringPayload\n\n**Compromising traffic**\n\n**Spoofing of User terminal** **management data**\n\n**Compromising Routing algorithm**\n\nsubscriptionsUsers RF requests\n\nPayload\nconfiguration\n\n**Responsibilities** **System intrusion** RF allocations\n\nMission Operator **from External Entity**\n\nSatellite Constellation Operator **Service Providers**\n\n1 Network Service Provider THALES GROUP INTERNALRessourcesrequests **Operation SegmentNetwork**\n\n\nRF requests\n\nRF allocations\n\n**Network**\n**Operation Segment**\n\n\n**_EACH SEGMENT IS A POTEN-**\n\n\n**THE CYBER THREAT**\n\n\n**_USER SEGMENT**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_LINK SEGMENT AND ATK13’S**\n**ATTACK EXAMPLE**\n\nThe main advantage for an espionage group to leverage the Link\nsegment is that it is difficult to\nidentify. Indeed, the geographical\nlocation of the C&C server is very\ndifficult to trace with this tactic\n\n\nsince Internet-based satellite receivers can be located anywhere\nin the area covered by the satellite.\nThe only drawback is the instability\nof the connection and its slowness.\nIn this case ATK13 used a very\nsimple method: Hijacking of DVB-S\nsatellite links.\nThe question is, how is this possible? As Kaspersky reminds us,\nfour basic elements are necessary:\n\n\n**ATK78’S ATTACK EXAMPLE**\n\n\n**_GROUND SEGMENT AND**\n\n\n**_USER SEGMENT: DATA**\n\n\n**USER**\n\n\ndents, anecdotal spoofing reports\nare not uncommon in Russian waters.\n**_SPACE SEGMENT: THE RISK**\n**OF TAKEOVER**\n\nAttacks on the satellites themselves are less common in recent\ntimes. Nevertheless, most of the\ntypologies of attacks described\nabove (living off the land tactic,\nlinks hijacking, GPS Spoofing/Jamming, etc.) can be means to reach\nthe space segment as a final target.\nHere, the most important risk is a\ntakeover or an OT attack on a satellite. In 2008 in a scientific article\nby Jessica A. Steinberger reported\n\n\n**_LINK SEGMENT AND ATK13’S**\n\n\n**ATTACK EXAMPLE**\n\n\nRemote script dropper\ne.g. LNK with PowerShell\nfrom cloud\n\n\n**Living Off the Land tactic**\n\n**1** **2** **3**\n\n\n\n- A satellite dish – the size depends\non geographical position and satellite,\n\n- A low-noise block downconverter\n(LNB),\n\n- A dedicated DVB-S tuner (PCIe\ncard)\n\n- A PC, preferably running Linux\n\n\n**_GROUND SEGMENT AND**\n**ATK78’S ATTACK EXAMPLE**\n\nIn January 2018, Symantec’s Targeted Attack Analytics TAA issued\nan alert for a major telecom operator in South-East Asia. The alert\nwas linked to an attack by a group\ncalled Thrip, which collects information on satellite-operating infrastructure.\nTo date, known targets are satellite operators in the USA and\nSouth-East Asia but also defence\ncontractors, telecom operators and\norganizations processing satellite\nimagery. In particular, the group\nlooks for information linked to satellite operations and geospatial\nimagery.\nThrip’s tactics are referred to here\nas ‘living off the land’ and employ\nlegitimate tools often already installed on its victims’ computers\nwith some scripting and shell code\nthat is hardly visible. It is therefore\na dualisation of legitimate tools\nused by satellite operators on the\nground for strategic and economic\nespionage.\n\n**_USER SEGMENT: DATA**\n**SPOOFING TO LURE THE**\n**USER**\n\nThere are many ways to spoof a\nGPS satellite. One way is to compromise the satellite’s receiver and\nalter its output signal. In 2017, the\nU.S. Maritime Administration reported the first GPS spoofing attack against over 20 ships in\nthe Black Sea. Correspondence\nbetween one of the impacted vessels and their command center indicates that over the course of the\nattack, the GPS position displayed\non their navigation tool sometimes\nshowed ‘lost GPS fixing position’.\nAt one point during the attack, the\nspoofed location showed the ship\nwas located near the Gelendzhik\nairport but was in fact 25 nautical\nmiles from the reported location.\nAccording to a non-profit organization called Resilient Navigation and\nTiming, which monitors GPS inci\n\n**INCURSION**\n\n\n**PERSISTENCE** **PAYLOAD**\n\n\nExploit in memory e.g.\nSMB EternalBlue\n\n\n**Non-persistent**\n\n\nMemory only malware\ne.g. SQL Slammer\n\n\nDual-use tools e.g. netsh\nor PsExec.exe\n\n\nEmail with Non-PE file\ne.g. document macro **Persistent** Memory only payload e.g.\nMirai DDoS\n\n\nFileless persistence\nloadpoint e.g. JScript in\nNon-PE file payload e.g.\nregistry\nPowerShell script\n\n\nWeak or stolen\ncredentials e.g. RDP\npassword guess\n\n\nRegular non-fileless\nmethod\n\n\nRegular non-fileless\npayload\n\n\n**Spoofing against over 20 ships in the Black Sea.**\n\n\n**SPOOFING TO LURE THE**\n\n\non a Trojan horse attack that allowed hackers to break into the\ncomputer system of the Johnson\nSpace Center in Houston, Texas.\nWith this access they managed\nto reach the International Space\nStation (ISS) and disrupt on-board\noperations.

As a result of the proliferation of attackers and their modus\noperandi, IT systems are often too\nvulnerable. As a result, attackers\nare finding more and more entry\npoints into increasingly vulnerable\nsystems. In addition, in 2020, a\nnumber of global events have favoured attacks against this sector\nof activity, such as the COVID-19\npandemic. Indeed, in this period of\ncoronavirus, attacking those in the\nsecond line unfortunately makes\nsense for malicious individuals. The\ntransport and logistics sector fulfils\nvital missions and therefore needs\n\n\nmore than ever to have fully operational information systems.\nIt is important to know that the\ntransport sector is made up of six\nsub-sectors: public transport and\npassenger rail, pipeline systems,\nroad and highway transport, the\nmaritime transport system, rail\nfreight, and postal and maritime\ntransport. The vitality of the sector’s interconnectedness and global\npresence makes it a tempting target for hackers.\n\n**_WHERE THE WEAKNESSES**\n**ARE: THE RAIL INDUSTRY**\n\nIn the rail industry, traditional wirebased train control and management systems (TCMS), which had\nonly limited communication with\nexternal systems, are giving way\nto wireless standards like GSMRailway, a relatively broad network\nlinking trains to railway regulation\ncontrol centers. As is the case for\n\n\nall mobility providers these days,\nT&L companies use vehicle infotainment services and other equipment that add another layer of internet-connected communications.\n\n**_WHERE THE WEAKNESSES**\n**ARE: THE MARITIME SECTOR**\n\nIn every segment of the transportation industry, the widened cyber-attack surface is evident. For\ninstance, among maritime companies, relatively simple distressand-safety systems have been replaced by full-fledged, cloud-based,\nlocal area networks, like the International Maritime Organization’s\n(IMO) e-navigation program. These\nnetworks are a tempting target for\nhackers because they collect, integrate, and analyze on-board information continuously to track ships’\nlocations, cargo details, maintenance issues, and a host of oceanic\nenvironmental considerations.\n\n\n**Wireless network connectivity is making railroads**\n**easy target for hackers**\n\n**Cargo ships are increasingly connected to communications systems**\n**that leave them vulnerable**\n\nRadar equipement\n\nSatellite Electronic Display\n\nPositioning Information System\nsystems (GPS) (ECDIS)\n\nVoyage data\nrecorders (VDRs)\n\nIT bridge\nsystems\n\nRadio frenquency (RF)\ncommunication\n\nCommunication\nsystems\n\nSatellite\n\nVessel communication\n\nCargo\nsystems\n\nOperational Water ingress\ntech systems alarm Level\n\nindication\n\nPower\nmanag- Closed-circuit (CCTV)\nment Engine television network\n\nEquipment Terminal Office Emergency response Container-sensing\nmanagment repar response systems\nvendors\n\n\n**ARE: THE RAIL INDUSTRY**\n\n\n**_WHERE THE WEAKNESSES**\n\n\n**_UNDERSTANDING**\n\n\nAutomatic\nIdentification\nSystem (AIS)\n\nIntegrated\ncommunication\nsystems\n\n\n**ARE: THE MARITIME SECTOR**\n\n\n**THE CYBER THREAT**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_THE IMPACT OF CYBER-**\n**CRIME IN THE TRANSPORTA-**\n**TION SECTOR**\n\nThe fallout from cyber attacks can\nsometimes be felt by organizations\nfor many months.\nIn addition to service interruptions,\ncybercrime can also impact daily\noperations and result in the exposure of sensitive data.\n\n- Below are sample impacts of cyber attacks in the transportation\nsector:\n\n- Disruption to traffic lights, toll\nbooths and electronic traffic signs\n\n- Interruption of ticket machines\nand fare gates\n\n- Blocked access to important files\nand data\n\n- Theft of sensitive information\nfrom emails\n\n- Interruption of payroll services\n\n- Theft of personally identifiable information (“PII”)\n\n\n\n- Blocked access to computer\nsystems, resulting in employees\nusing personal devices for work.\n\n**_TRANSPORTATION CYBE-**\n**RATTACKS CAN BE DEVASTA-**\n**TING**\n\nTransportation is the tenth most\ncostly industry for experiencing a\ndata breach. On average, breaches\ncost transit companies $3.58 million per incident and take 275 days\nto contain. As cyberattacks on the\nsector grow increasingly common,\nthese figures could grow, leading\nto incredible losses.\nExample of devastating attack: in\nearly May 2021, the Colonial Pipeline suffered a ransomware attack that forced it to shut down\nits entire network to prevent the\nmalware from spreading.\n\n\nIndeed, Colonial Pipeline, the largest oil pipeline in the United\nStates, shut down operations after suffering what is believed to\nbe a ransomware attack. Colonial\nPipeline transports refined petroleum products between refineries\non the Gulf Coast and markets in\nthe southern and eastern United\nStates. The company transports\n2.5 million barrels per day through\nits 5,500-mile pipeline and supplies\n45% of all fuel consumed on the\nEast Coast\n\n\n**RATTACKS CAN BE DEVASTA-**\n\n\n**_TRANSPORTATION CYBE-**\n\n\n**TION SECTOR**\n\n\n**Top threats in the transportation industry**\n\n\n**CRIME IN THE TRANSPORTA-**\n\n\n**TING**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Our\n# experts\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Cybels Train & Experiment\n\n Thales SOC\n\n\n-----\n\n# References\n\n\n-----\n\n**EAST ASIA AREA**\n\n**_Page 50 to 55_**\n\n1 Franck Manuelle, ‘Une géographie de\nl’Asie du Sud-Est’, Document, Géoconfluences (ENS Lyon), 3 June 2020,\nhttp://geoconfluences.ens-lyon.fr/informations-scientifiques/dossiers-regionaux/asiedu-sud-est/cadrage.\n2 Hyonhee Shin, ‘N.Korea’s Trade with China Plunges 80% as COVID-19 Lockdown\nBites’, Reuters, 19 January 2021, sec.\nChina, https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nkoreas-trade-with-china-plunges-80covid-19-lockdown-bites-2021-01-19/.\n3 Lee Seong-hyon, ‘China-N.
