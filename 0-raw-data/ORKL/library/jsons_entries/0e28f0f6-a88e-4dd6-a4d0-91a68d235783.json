Recent Russian\nstate-sponsored cyber operations have included DDoS attacks against Ukrainian organizations. Note:\nfor more information on Russian state-sponsored cyber activity, including known TTPs, see joint CSA\nUnderstanding and Mitigating Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure.\nCyber threat actors from the following Russian government and military organizations have conducted\nmalicious cyber operations against IT and/or OT networks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), including FSB’s Center 16 and Center 18\nRussian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)\nRussian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), 85th Main Special Service\nCenter (GTsSS)\nGRU’s Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST)\nRussian Ministry of Defense, Central Scientific Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics\n(TsNIIKhM)\n\nThe Russian Federal Security Service\nOverview: FSB, the KGB’s successor agency, has conducted malicious cyber operations targeting\nthe Energy Sector, including UK and U.S. energy companies, U.S. aviation organizations, U.S.\ngovernment and military personnel, private organizations, cybersecurity companies, and journalists.\nFSB has been known to task criminal hackers for espionage-focused cyber activity; these same\nhackers have separately been responsible for disruptive ransomware and phishing campaigns.\nIndustry reporting identifies three intrusion sets associated with the FSB, but the U.S. and UK\ngovernments have only formally attributed one of these sets—known as BERSERK BEAR—to FSB.\n\n\nBERSERK BEAR (also known as Crouching Yeti, Dragonfly, Energetic Bear, and\nTemp.Isotope) has, according to industry reporting, historically targeted entities in Western\nEurope and North America, including state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) organizations, as\nwell as Energy, Transportation Systems, and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector\norganizations. This group has also targeted the Water and Wastewater Systems Sector and\nother critical infrastructure facilities. Common TTPs include scanning to exploit internet-facing\ninfrastructure and network appliances, conducting brute force attacks against public-facing\nweb applications, and leveraging compromised infrastructure—often websites frequented or\n\nPage 3 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nProduct ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nowned by their target—for Windows New Technology Local Area Network Manager (NTLM)\ncredential theft. Industry reporting assesses that this actor has a destructive mandate.\nThe U.S. and UK governments assess that this APT group is almost certainly FSB’s Center\n16, or Military Unit 71330, and that FSB’s Center 16 has conducted cyber operations against\ncritical IT systems and infrastructure in Europe, the Americas, and Asia.\nResources: for more information on BERSERK BEAR, see the MITRE ATT&CK® webpage\non Dragonfly.\nHigh-Profile Activity: in 2017, FSB employees, including one employee in the FSB Center for\nInformation Security (also known as Unit 64829 and Center 18), were indicted by the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) for accessing email accounts of U.S. government and military personnel,\nprivate organizations, and cybersecurity companies, as well as email accounts of journalists critical of\nthe Russian government.[9] More recently, in 2021, FSB Center 16 officers were indicted by the U.S.\nDOJ for their involvement in a multi-stage campaign in which they gained remote access to U.S. and\ninternational Energy Sector networks, deployed ICS-focused malware, and collected and exfiltrated\nenterprise and ICS-related data. One of the victims was a U.S. nuclear power plant.[10]\nResources: for more information on FSB, see:\n\n\n\n\nU.S. DOJ Press Release Four Russian Government Employees Charged in Two Historical\nHacking Campaigns Targeting Critical Infrastructure Worldwide\nJoint CSA Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures of Indicted State-Sponsored Russian Cyber\nActors Targeting the Energy Sector\nUK Press Release UK Exposes Russian Spy Agency Behind Cyber Incidents\n\nRussian Foreign Intelligence Service\nOverview: SVR has operated an APT group since at least 2008 that has targeted multiple critical\ninfrastructure organizations. SVR cyber threat actors have used a range of initial exploitation\ntechniques that vary in sophistication coupled with stealthy intrusion tradecraft within compromised\nnetworks. SVR cyber actors’ novel tooling and techniques include:\n\n\n\nCustom, sophisticated multi-platform malware targeting Windows and Linux systems (e.g.,\nGoldMax and TrailBlazer); and\nLateral movement via the “credential hopping” technique, which includes browser cookie theft\nto bypass multifactor authentication (MFA) on privileged cloud accounts.[11]\n\nHigh-Profile Activity: the U.S. Government, the Government of Canada, and the UK Government\nassess that SVR cyber threat actors were responsible for the SolarWinds Orion supply chain\ncompromise and the associated campaign that affected U.S. government agencies, critical\ninfrastructure entities, and private sector organizations.[12][13][14]\nAlso known as: APT29, COZY BEAR, CozyDuke, Dark Halo, The Dukes, NOBELIUM, and\nNobleBaron, StellarParticle, UNC2452, YTTRIUM [15]\n\nPage 4 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nProduct ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nResources: for more information on SVR, see:\n\n\n\n\nJoint CSA Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Cyber Operations: Trends and Best\nPractices for Network Defenders\nJoint Advisory Further TTPs associated with SVR cyber actors\nThe MITRE ATT&CK webpage on APT29\n\nFor more information on the SolarWinds Orion supply chain compromise, see:\n\n\n\n\nCISA’s Supply Chain Compromise webpage\nCISA’s webpage on Remediating Networks Affected by the SolarWinds and Active\nDirectory/M365 Compromise\nNCSC-UK Guidance Dealing with the SolarWinds Orion compromise\n\nGRU, 85th Main Special Service Center\nOverview: GTsSS, or Unit 26165, is an APT group that has operated since at least 2004 and\nprimarily targets government organizations, travel and hospitality entities, research institutions, and\nnon-governmental organizations, in addition to other critical infrastructure organizations.\nAccording to industry reporting, GTsSS cyber actors frequently collect credentials to gain initial\naccess to target organizations. GTsSS actors have collected victim credentials by sending\nspearphishing emails that appear to be legitimate security alerts from the victim’s email provider and\ninclude hyperlinks leading to spoofed popular webmail services’ logon pages. GTsSS actors have\nalso registered domains to conduct credential harvesting operations. These domains mimic popular\ninternational social media platforms and masquerade as tourism- and sports-related entities and\nmusic and video streaming services.\nHigh-Profile Activity: the U.S. Government assesses that GTsSS cyber actors have deployed\nDrovorub malware against victim devices as part of their cyber espionage operations.[16] The U.S.\nGovernment and UK Government assess that GTsSS actors used a Kubernetes® cluster to conduct\nwidespread, distributed, and anonymized brute force access attempts against hundreds of\ngovernment and private sector targets worldwide.[17]\nAlso known as: APT28, FANCY BEAR, Group 74, IRON TWILIGHT, PawnStorm, Sednit,\nSNAKEMACKEREL, Sofacy, STRONTIUM, Swallowtail, TG-4127, Threat Group-4127, and Tsar\nTeam [18]\nResources: for more information on GTsSS, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage on APT28.\n\nGRU’s Main Center of Special Technologies\nOverview: GTsST, or Unit 74455, is an APT group that has operated since at least 2009 and has\ntargeted a variety of critical infrastructure organizations, including those in the Energy, Transportation\nSystems, and Financial Services Sectors. According to industry reporting, GTsST also has an\nextensive history of conducting cyber espionage as well as destructive and disruptive operations\n\nPage 5 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nProduct ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nagainst NATO member states, Western government and military organizations, and critical\ninfrastructure-related organizations, including in the Energy Sector.\nThe primary distinguishing characteristic of the group is its operations use techniques aimed at\ncausing disruptive or destructive effects at targeted organizations using DDoS attacks or wiper\nmalware. The group’s destructive operations have also leveraged wiper malware that mimics\nransomware or hacktivism and can result in collateral effects to organizations beyond the primary\nintended targets. Some of their disruptive operations have shown disregard or ignorance of potential\nsecondary or tertiary effects.\nHigh-Profile Activity: the malicious activity below has been previously attributed to GTsST by the\nU.S. Government and the UK Government.[19][20]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGTsST actors conducted a cyberattack against Ukrainian energy distribution companies in\nDecember 2015, leading to disruption of multiple companies’ operations and widespread\ntemporary outages. The actors deployed BlackEnergy malware to steal user credentials and\nused BlackEnergy’s destructive component, KillDisk, to make infected computers inoperable.\nIn 2016, GTsST actors conducted a cyber-intrusion campaign against a Ukrainian electrical\ntransmission company and deployed CrashOverride malware (also known as Industroyer)\nspecifically designed to attack power grids.\nIn June 2017, GTsST actors deployed NotPetya disruptive malware against Ukrainian\nfinancial, energy, and government organizations. NotPetya masqueraded as ransomware, had\na large collateral impact, and caused damage to millions of devices globally.\nIn 2018, GTsST actors deployed data-deletion malware against the Winter Olympics and\nParalympics using VPNFilter.\n\nThe U.S. Government, Government of Canada, and UK Government have also attributed the October\n2019 large-scale, disruptive cyber operations against a range of Georgian web hosting providers to\nGTsST. This activity resulted in websites—including sites belonging to the Georgian government,\ncourts, non-government organizations (NGOs), media, and businesses—being defaced and\ninterrupted the service of several national broadcasters.[21][22][23]\nAlso known as: ELECTRUM, IRON VIKING, Quedagh, the Sandworm Team, Telebots, VOODOO\nBEAR [24]\nResources: for more information on GTsST, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage on Sandworm Team.\n\nRussian Ministry of Defense, Central Scientific Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics\nOverview: TsNIIKhM, as described on their webpage, is a research organization under Russia’s\nMinistry of Defense (MOD). Actors associated with TsNIIKhM have developed destructive ICS\nmalware.\nHigh-Profile Activity: TsNIIKhM has been sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for\nconnections to the destructive Triton malware (also called HatMan and TRISIS); TsNIIKhM has been\nsanctioned by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO) for a 2017 incident\n\nPage 6 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nProduct ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nthat involved safety override controls (with Triton malware) in a foreign oil refinery.[25][26] In 2021,\nthe U.S. DOJ indicted a TsNIIKhM Applied Development Center (ADC) employee for conducting\ncomputer intrusions against U.S. Energy Sector organizations. The indicted employee also accessed\nthe systems of a foreign oil refinery and deployed Triton malware.[27] Triton is a custom-built malware\ndesigned to manipulate safety instrumented systems within ICS controllers, disabling the safety\nalarms that prevent dangerous conditions.\nAlso known as: Temp.Veles, XENOTIME [28]\nResources: for more information on TsNIIKhM, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage on TEMP.Veles.\nFor more information on Triton, see:\n\n\n\n\n\nCISA Malware Analysis Report (MAR) HatMan – Safety System Targeted Malware (update B)\nCISA ICS Advisory Schneider Electric Triconex Tricon (Update B)\nJoint CSA Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures of Indicted State-Sponsored Russian Cyber\nActors Targeting the Energy Sector\nNCSC-UK Advisory TRITON Malware Targeting Safety Controllers\n\nRussian-Aligned Cyber Threat Groups\nIn addition to the APT groups identified in the Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Operations section,\nindustry reporting identifies two intrusion sets—PRIMITIVE BEAR and VENOMOUS BEAR—as statesponsored APT groups, but U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities have\nnot attributed these groups to the Russian government.\n\n\nPRIMITIVE BEAR has, according to industry reporting, targeted Ukrainian organizations since\nat least 2013. This activity includes targeting Ukrainian government, military, and law\nenforcement entities using high-volume spearphishing campaigns to deliver its custom\nmalware. According to industry reporting, PRIMITIVE BEAR conducted multiple cyber\noperations targeting Ukrainian organizations in the lead up to Russia’s invasion.\nResources: for more information on PRIMITIVE BEAR, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage on\nthe Gamaredon Group.\n\n\n\nVENOMOUS BEAR has, according to industry reporting, historically targeted governments\naligned with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), defense contractors, and other\norganizations of intelligence value. Venomous Bear is known for its unique use of hijacked\nsatellite internet connections for command and control (C2). It is also known for the hijacking\nof other non-Russian state-sponsored APT actor infrastructure.[29] VENOMOUS BEAR has\nalso historically leveraged compromised infrastructure and maintained an arsenal of customdeveloped sophisticated malware families, which is extremely complex and interoperable with\nvariants developed over time. VENOMOUS BEAR has developed tools for multiple platforms,\nincluding Windows, Mac, and Linux.[30]\nResources: for more information on VENOMOUS BEAR, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage\non Turla.\n\nPage 7 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nProduct ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nRussian-Aligned Cybercrime Groups\nCybercrime groups are typically financially motivated cyber actors that seek to exploit human or\nsecurity vulnerabilities to enable direct theft of money (e.g., by obtaining bank login information) or by\nextorting money from victims. These groups pose consistent threats to critical infrastructure\norganizations globally.\nSince Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, some cybercrime groups have independently\npublicly pledged support for the Russian government or the Russian people and/or threatened to\nconduct cyber operations to retaliate against perceived attacks against Russia or materiel support for\nUkraine. These Russian-aligned cybercrime groups likely pose a threat to critical infrastructure\norganizations primarily through:\n\n\n\nDeploying ransomware through which cyber actors remove victim access to data (usually via\nencryption), potentially causing significant disruption to operations.\nConducting DDoS attacks against websites.\no In a DDoS attack, the cyber actor generates enough requests to flood and overload the\ntarget page and stop it from responding.\no DDoS attacks are often accompanied by extortion.\no According to industry reporting, some cybercrime groups have recently carried out\nDDoS attacks against Ukrainian defense organizations, and one group claimed credit\nfor DDoS attack against a U.S. airport the actors perceived as supporting Ukraine (see\nthe Killnet section).\n\nBased on industry and open-source reporting, U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK\ncyber authorities assess multiple Russian-aligned cybercrime groups pose a threat to critical\ninfrastructure organizations. These groups include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CoomingProject\nKillnet\nMUMMY SPIDER\nSALTY SPIDER\nSCULLY SPIDER\nSMOKEY SPIDER\nWIZARD SPIDER\nThe Xaknet Team\n\nNote: although some cybercrime groups may conduct cyber operations in support of the Russian\ngovernment, U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities assess that cyber\ncriminals will most likely continue to operate primarily based on financial motivations, which may\ninclude targeting government and critical infrastructure organizations.\n\nThe CoomingProject\nOverview: the CoomingProject is a criminal group that extorts money from victims by exposing or\nthreatening to expose leaked data. Their data leak site was launched in August 2021.[31] The\n\nPage 8 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nProduct ID: AA22-110A\n\nCoomingProject stated they would support the Russian Government in response to perceived\ncyberattacks against Russia.[32]\n\nKillnet\nOverview: according to open-source reporting, Killnet released a video pledging support to\nRussia.[33]\nVictims: Killnet claimed credit for carrying out a DDoS attack against a U.S. airport in March 2022 in\nresponse to U.S. materiel support for Ukraine.[34]\n\nMUMMY SPIDER\nOverview: MUMMY SPIDER is a cybercrime group that creates, distributes, and operates the Emotet\nbotnet. Emotet is advanced, modular malware that originated as a banking trojan (malware designed\nto steal information from banking systems but that may also be used to drop additional malware and\nransomware). Today Emotet primarily functions as a downloader and distribution service for other\ncybercrime groups. Emotet has been used to deploy WIZARD SPIDER’s TrickBot, which is often a\nprecursor to ransomware delivery. Emotet has worm-like features that enable rapid spreading in an\ninfected network.\nVictims: according to open sources, Emotet has been used to target industries worldwide, including\nfinancial, e-commerce, healthcare, academia, government, and technology organizations’ networks.\nAlso known as: Gold Crestwood, TA542, TEMP.Mixmaster, UNC3443\nResources: for more information on Emotet, see joint Alert Emotet Malware. For more information on\nTrickBot, see joint CSA TrickBot Malware.\n\nSALTY SPIDER\nOverview: SALTY SPIDER is a cybercrime group that develops and operates the Sality botnet. Sality\nis a polymorphic file infector that was discovered in 2003; since then, it has been replaced by more\nadvanced peer-to-peer (P2P) malware loaders.[35]\nVictims: according to industry reporting, in February 2022, SALTY SPIDER conducted DDoS attacks\nagainst Ukrainian web forums used to discuss events relating to Russia’s military offensive against\nthe city of Kharkiv.\nAlso known as: Sality\n\nSCULLY SPIDER\nOverview: SCULLY SPIDER is a cybercrime group that operates using a malware-as-a-service\nmodel; SCULLY SPIDER maintains command and control infrastructure and sells access to their\nmalware and infrastructure to affiliates, who distribute their own malware.[36][37] SCULLY SPIDER\ndevelops and operates the DanaBot botnet, which originated primarily as a banking Trojan but\nexpanded beyond banking in 2021 and has since been used to facilitate access for other types of\nmalware, including TrickBot, DoppelDridex, and Zloader. Like Emotet, Danabot effectively functions\nas an initial access vector for other malware, which can result in ransomware deployment.\n\nPage 9 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nProduct ID: AA22-110A\n\nAccording to industry reporting, recent DDoS activity by the DanaBot botnet suggests SCULLY\nSPIDER has operated in support of Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine.\nVictims: SCULLY SPIDER affiliates have primarily targeted organizations in the United States,\nCanada, Germany, United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Poland, Mexico, and Ukraine.[38] According to\nindustry reporting, in March 2022, Danabot was used in DDoS attacks against multiple Ukrainian\ngovernment organizations.\nAlso known as: Gold Opera\n\nSMOKEY SPIDER\nOverview: SMOKEY SPIDER is a cybercrime group that develops Smoke Loader (also known as\nSmoke Bot), a malicious bot that is used to upload other malware. Smoke Loader has been available\nsince at least 2011, and operates as a malware distribution service for a number of different payloads,\nincluding—but not limited to—DanaBot, TrickBot, and Qakbot.\nVictims: according to industry reporting, Smoke Loader was observed in March 2022 distributing\nDanaBot payloads that were subsequently used in DDoS attacks against Ukrainian targets.\nResources: for more information on Smoke Loader, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage on Smoke\nLoader.\n\nWIZARD SPIDER\nOverview: WIZARD SPIDER is a cybercrime group that develops TrickBot malware and Conti\nransomware. Historically, the group has paid a wage to the ransomware deployers (referred to as\naffiliates), some of whom may then receive a share of the proceeds from a successful ransomware\nattack. In addition to TrickBot, notable initial access and persistence vectors for affiliated actors\ninclude Emotet, Cobalt Strike, spearphishing, and stolen or weak Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)\ncredentials.\nAfter obtaining access, WIZARD SPIDER affiliated actors have relied on various publicly available\nand otherwise legitimate tools to facilitate earlier stages of the attack lifecycle before deploying Conti\nransomware.\nWIZARD SPIDER pledged support to the Russian government and threatened critical infrastructure\norganizations of countries perceived to carry out cyberattacks or war against the Russian\ngovernment.[39] They later revised this pledge and threatened to retaliate against perceived attacks\nagainst the Russian people.[40]\nVictims: Conti victim organizations span across multiple industries, including construction and\nengineering, legal and professional services, manufacturing, and retail. In addition, WIZARD SPIDER\naffiliates have deployed Conti ransomware against U.S. healthcare and first responder networks.\nAlso known as: UNC2727, Gold Ulrick\nResources: for more information on Conti, see joint CSA Conti Ransomware. For more information\non TrickBot, see joint CSA TrickBot Malware.\n\nPage 10 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nProduct ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nThe XakNet Team\nOverview: XakNet is a Russian-language cyber group that has been active as early as March 2022.\nAccording to open-source reporting, the XakNet Team threatened to target Ukrainian organizations in\nresponse to perceived DDoS or other attacks against Russia.[41] According to reporting from\nindustry, on March 31, 2022, XakNet released a statement stating they would work “exclusively for\nthe good of [Russia].” According to industry reporting, the XakNet Team may be working with or\nassociated with Killnet actors, who claimed credit for the DDoS attacks against a U.S. airport (see the\nKillnet section).\nVictims: according to industry reporting, in late March 2022, the XakNet Team leaked email contents\nof a Ukrainian government official. The leak was accompanied by a political statement criticizing the\nUkrainian government, suggesting the leak was politically motivated.\n\nMITIGATIONS\nU.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities urge critical infrastructure\norganizations to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats by immediately (1) updating software,\n(2) enforcing MFA, (3) securing and monitoring RDP and other potentially risky services, and (4)\nproviding end-user awareness and training.\n\n\nUpdate software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware, on IT\nnetwork assets. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities and critical and high\nvulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or denial-of-service on internet-facing\nequipment.\no Consider using a centralized patch management system. For OT networks, use a riskbased assessment strategy to determine the OT network assets and zones that should\nparticipate in the patch management program.\no Consider signing up for CISA’s cyber hygiene services, including vulnerability\nscanning, to help reduce exposure to threats. CISA’s vulnerability scanning service\nevaluates external network presence by executing continuous scans of public, static IP\naddresses for accessible services and vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nEnforce MFA to the greatest extent possible and require accounts with password\nlogins, including service accounts, to have strong passwords. Do not allow passwords to\nbe used across multiple accounts or stored on a system to which an adversary may have\naccess. As Russian state-sponsored APT actors have demonstrated the ability to exploit\ndefault MFA protocols and known vulnerabilities, organizations should review configuration\npolicies to protect against “fail open” and re-enrollment scenarios. For more information, see\njoint CSA Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Gain Network Access by Exploiting Default\nMultifactor Authentication Protocols and “PrintNightmare” Vulnerability.\nIf you use RDP and/or other potentially risky services, secure and monitor them\nclosely. RDP exploitation is one of the top initial infection vectors for ransomware, and risky\n\n\n\nPage 11 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nProduct ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nservices, including RDP, can allow unauthorized access to your session using an on-path\nattacker.\no Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and\nusing virtual desktop infrastructure. After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed\noperationally necessary, restrict the originating sources and require MFA to mitigate\ncredential theft and reuse. If RDP must be available externally, use a virtual private\nnetwork (VPN) or other means to authenticate and secure the connection before\nallowing RDP to connect to internal devices. Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce\naccount lockouts after a specified number of attempts to block brute force attempts, log\nRDP login attempts, and disable unused remote access/RDP ports.\no Ensure devices are properly configured and that security features are enabled. Disable\nports and protocols that are not being used for a business purpose (e.g., RDP\nTransmission Control Protocol Port 3389).\n\n\nProvide end-user awareness and training to help prevent successful targeted social\nengineering and spearphishing campaigns. Phishing is one of the top infection vectors for\nransomware, and Russian state-sponsored APT actors have conducted successful\nspearphishing campaigns to gain credentials of target networks.\no Ensure that employees are aware of potential cyber threats and delivery methods.\no Ensure that employees are aware of what to do and whom to contact when they\nreceive a suspected phishing email or suspect a cyber incident.\n\nAs part of a longer-term effort, implement network segmentation to separate network segments\nbased on role and functionality. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware\nand threat actor lateral movement by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various\nsubnetworks.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure OT assets are not externally accessible. Ensure strong identity and access\nmanagement when OT assets needs to be externally accessible.\nAppropriately implement network segmentation between IT and OT networks. Network\nsegmentation limits the ability of adversaries to pivot to the OT network even if the IT network\nis compromised. Define a demilitarized zone that eliminates unregulated communication\nbetween the IT and OT networks.\nOrganize OT assets into logical zones by considering criticality, consequence, and operational\nnecessity. Define acceptable communication conduits between the zones and deploy security\ncontrols to filter network traffic and monitor communications between zones. Prohibit ICS\nprotocols from traversing the IT network.\n\nTo further prepare for and mitigate cyber threats from Russian state-sponsored or criminal actors,\nU.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities encourage critical infrastructure\norganizations to implement the recommendations listed below.\n\nPage 12 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nProduct ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nPreparing for Cyber Incidents\n\n\nCreate, maintain, and exercise a cyber incident response and continuity of operations plan.\no Ensure the cyber incident response plan contains ransomware- and DDoS-specific\nannexes. For information on preparing for DDoS attacks, see NCSC-UK guidance on\npreparing for denial-of-service attacks.\no Keep hard copies of the incident response plan to ensure responders and network\ndefenders can access the plan if the network has been shut down by ransomware, etc.\n\n\n\nMaintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data. Backup procedures should be\nconducted on a frequent, regular basis (at a minimum every 90 days). Regularly test backup\nprocedures and ensure that backups are isolated from network connections that could enable\nthe spread of malware.\no Ensure the backup keys are kept offline as well, to prevent them being encrypted in a\nransomware incident.\n\n\n\nEnsure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers\nthe entire organization’s data infrastructure with a particular focus on key data assets.\nDevelop recovery documentation that includes configuration settings for common devices and\ncritical equipment. Such documentation can enable more efficient recovery following an\nincident.\nIdentify the attack surface by mapping and accounting all external-facing assets (applications,\nservers, IP addresses) that are vulnerable to DDoS attacks or other cyber operations.\nFor OT assets/networks:\no Identify a resilience plan that addresses how to operate if you lose access to—or\ncontrol of—the IT and/or OT environment.\no Identify OT and IT network interdependencies and develop workarounds or manual\ncontrols to ensure ICS networks can be isolated from IT networks if the connections\ncreate risk to the safe and reliable operation of OT processes. Regularly test\ncontingency plans, such as manual controls, so that safety-critical functions can be\nmaintained during a cyber incident. Ensure that the OT network can operate at\nnecessary capacity even if the IT network is compromised.\no Regularly test manual controls so that critical functions can be kept running if ICS or\nOT networks need to be taken offline.\no Implement data backup procedures.\no Develop recovery documents that include configuration settings for common devices\nand critical OT equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentity and Access Management\n\n\nRequire accounts with password logins, including service accounts, to have strong passwords\nand do not allow passwords to be used across multiple accounts or stored on a system to\nwhich an adversary may have access. Consider using a password manager; see NCSC-UK’s\nPassword Manager Buyers Guide for guidance.\n\nPage 13 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nProduct ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement authentication timeout and lockout features to prevent repeated failed login\nattempts and successful brute-force attempts.\nCreate a deny list of known compromised credentials and prevent users from using knowncompromised passwords.\nSecure credentials by restricting where accounts and credentials can be used and by using\nlocal device credential protection features. Russian state-sponsored APT actors have\ndemonstrated their ability to maintain persistence using compromised credentials.\no Use virtualizing solutions on modern hardware and software to ensure credentials are\nsecurely stored.\no Ensure storage of clear text passwords in Local Security Authority Subsystem Service\n(LSASS) memory is disabled. Note: for Windows 8, this is enabled by default. For\nmore information see Microsoft Security Advisory Update to Improve Credentials\nProtection and Management.\no Consider disabling or limiting NTLM and WDigest Authentication.\no Implement Credential Guard for Windows 10 and Server 2016 (refer to Microsoft:\nManage Windows Defender Credential Guard for more information). For Windows\nServer 2012R2, enable Protected Process Light for Local Security Authority (LSA).\no Minimize the Active Directory (AD) attack surface to reduce malicious ticket-granting\nactivity. Malicious activity such as “Kerberoasting” takes advantage of Kerberos’ Ticket\nGranting Service (TGS) and can be used to obtain hashed credentials that malicious\ncyber actors attempt to crack.\n\n\n\nAudit domain controllers to log successful Kerberos TGS requests and ensure the events are\nmonitored for anomalous activity.\no Secure accounts.\no Enforce the principle of least privilege. Administrator accounts should have the\nminimum permission necessary to complete their tasks.\no Ensure there are unique and distinct administrative accounts for each set of\nadministrative tasks.\no Create non-privileged accounts for privileged users and ensure they use the nonprivileged accounts for all non-privileged access (e.g., web browsing, email access).\n\n\n\n\nDisable inactive accounts uniformly across the AD, MFA systems, etc.\nImplement time-based access for privileged accounts. The FBI and CISA observed\ncybercriminals conducting increasingly impactful attacks against U.S. entities on holidays and\nweekends in 2021. Threat actors may view holidays and weekends—when offices are\nnormally closed—as attractive timeframes, as there are fewer network defenders and IT\nsupport personnel at victim organizations. The just-in-time access method provisions\nprivileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege\n(as well as the zero-trust model) by setting network-wide policy to automatically disable admin\naccounts at the AD level. As needed, individual users can submit requests through an\nautomated process that enables access to a system for a set timeframe.\n\nPage 14 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nProduct ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nProtective Controls and Architecture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity that may indicate lateral movement by a\nthreat actor, ransomware, or other malware. Use network monitoring tools and host-based\nlogs and monitoring tools, such as an endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool. EDR tools\nare particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and\nuncommon network connections for each host.\nImplement a firewall and configure it to block Domain Name System (DNS) responses from\noutside the enterprise network or drop Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets.\nReview which admin services need to be accessible externally and allow those explicitly,\nblocking all others by default.\no U.S. Defense Industrial Base organizations may sign up for the NSA Cybersecurity\nCollaboration Center’s Protective Domain Name System (PDNS) services.\nEnable web application firewalls to mitigate application-level DDoS attacks.\nImplement a multi-content delivery network (CDN) solution. This will minimize the threat of\nDDoS attacks by distributing and balancing web traffic across a network.\n\nVulnerability and Configuration Management\n\n\nUse an antivirus programs that uses heuristics and reputational ratings to check a file’s\nprevalence and digital signature prior to execution. Note: organizations should assess the\nrisks inherent in their software supply chain (including its security/antivirus software supply\nchain) in light of the existing threat landscape.\no Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets\nusing up-to-date signatures.\no Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine how OT network assets are\nidentified and evaluated for the presence of malware.\n\n\n\nImplement rigorous configuration management programs. Ensure the programs can track and\nmitigate emerging threats. Review system configurations for misconfigurations and security\nweaknesses.\nDisable all unnecessary ports and protocols.\no Review network security device logs and determine whether to shut off unnecessary\nports and protocols. Monitor common ports and protocols for command and control\nactivity.\no Turn off or disable any unnecessary services (e.g., PowerShell) or functionality within\ndevices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify business-to-business VPNs and block high-risk protocols.\nEnsure OT hardware is in read-only mode.\nEnable strong spam filters.\no Enable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users.\no Filter emails containing executable files to prevent them from reaching end users.\n\nPage 15 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nProduct ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\no\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement a user training program to discourage users from visiting malicious\nwebsites or opening malicious attachments.\n\nRestrict Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol within the network to only access servers that\nare necessary and remove or disable outdated versions of SMB (i.e., SMB version 1). Threat\nactors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations.\nReview the security posture of third-party vendors and those interconnected with your\norganization. Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software or\nhardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.\nImplement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to\nexecute known and permitted programs under an established security policy.\nOpen document readers in protected viewing modes to help prevent active content from\nrunning.\n\nResponding to Cyber Incidents\nU.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cybersecurity authorities urge network defenders\nof critical infrastructure organizations to exercise due diligence in identifying indicators of malicious\nactivity. Organizations detecting potential APT or ransomware activity in their IT or OT networks\nshould:\n1. Immediately isolate affected systems.\n2. For DDoS attacks:\na. Identify the source address originating the attack via the SIEM or logging service. If the\nattack is originating from a single pool of IP addresses, block IP traffic from suspected\nIPs via access control lists or by contacting your internet service provider (ISP).\nb. Enable firewall rate limiting to restrict the amount of IP traffic coming in from suspected\nIP addresses\nc. Notify your ISP and enable remote triggered blackhole (RTBH).\n3. Secure backups. Ensure your backup data is offline and secure. If possible, scan your backup\ndata with an antivirus program to ensure it is free of malware.\n4. Collect and review relevant logs, data, and artifacts.\n5. Consider soliciting support from a third-party IT organization to provide subject matter\nexpertise, ensure the actor is eradicated from the network, and avoid residual issues that\ncould enable follow-on exploitation.\n6. Report incidents to appropriate cyber and law enforcement authorities:\n\n\nU.S organizations: share information about incidents and anomalous activity to\nCISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870 and/or the FBI\nvia your local FBI field office or the FBI’s 24/7 CyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or\n\nPage 16 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nProduct ID: AA22-110A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCyWatch@fbi.gov. For ransomware incidents, organizations can also report to the U.S.\nSecret Service via a U.S. Secret Service Field Office.\n\n\nAustralian organizations: if you have questions about this advice or have indications\nthat your environment has been compromised, call the ACSC at 1300 CYBER1 (1300\n292 371).
