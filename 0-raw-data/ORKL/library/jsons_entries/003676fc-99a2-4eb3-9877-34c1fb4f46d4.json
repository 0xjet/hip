This includes systems used to perform\nbackground checks and systems used to request birth, death, and marriage certificates, all of\nwhich are now processed and reviewed manually, in person or via the phone.\n\nTags\n\n[Alaska](https://therecord.media/tag/alaska/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[APT](https://therecord.media/tag/apt/)\n[cyberattack](https://therecord.media/tag/cyberattack/)\n[health department](https://therecord.media/tag/health-department/)\n[nation-state](https://therecord.media/tag/nation-state-2/)\n[social security](https://therecord.media/tag/social-security/)\n[USA](https://therecord.media/tag/usa/)\n[website vulnerability](https://therecord.media/tag/website-vulnerability/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
