Benczkowski of the Justice\nDepartment’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Justin E. Herdman of the Northern District\nof Ohio.\n\nBogdan Nicolescu, 36, and Radu Miclaus, 37, were convicted after a 12-day trial of\nconspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit service marks,\naggravated identity theft, conspiracy to commit money laundering and 12 counts each of wire\nfraud. Sentencing has been set for Aug. 14, 2019 before Chief Judge Patricia A. Gaughan of\nthe Northern District of Ohio.\n\nAccording to testimony at trial and court documents, Nicolescu, Miclaus, and a coconspirator who pleaded guilty, collectively operated a criminal conspiracy from Bucharest,\nRomania. It began in 2007 with the development of proprietary malware, which they\n\n\n-----\n\ndisseminated through malicious emails purporting to be legitimate from such entities as\nWestern Union, Norton AntiVirus and the IRS. When recipients clicked on an attached file,\nthe malware was surreptitiously installed onto their computer.\n\nThis malware harvested email addresses from the infected computer, such as from contact\nlists or email accounts, and then sent malicious emails to these harvested email addresses.\nThe defendants infected and controlled more than 400,000 individual computers, primarily in\nthe United States.\n\nControlling these computers allowed the defendants to harvest personal information, such as\ncredit card information, user names and passwords. They disabled victims’ malware\nprotection and blocked the victims’ access to websites associated with law enforcement.\n\nControlling the computers also allowed the defendants to use the processing power of the\ncomputer to solve complex algorithms for the financial benefit of the group, a process known\nas cryptocurrency mining.\n\nThe defendants used stolen email credentials to copy a victim’s email contacts. They also\nactivated files that forced infected computers to register email accounts with AOL. The\ndefendants registered more than 100,000 email accounts using this method. They then sent\nmalicious emails from these addresses to the compromised contact lists. Through this\nmethod, they sent tens of millions of malicious emails.\n\nWhen victims with infected computers visited websites such as Facebook, PayPal, eBay or\nothers, the defendants would intercept the request and redirect the computer to a nearly\nidentical website they had created. The defendants would then steal account credentials.\nThey used the stolen credit card information to fund their criminal infrastructure, including\nrenting server space, registering domain names using fictitious identities and paying for\nVirtual Private Networks (VPNs) which further concealed their identities.\n\nThe defendants were also able to inject fake pages into legitimate websites, such as eBay, to\nmake victims believe they were receiving and following instructions from legitimate websites,\nwhen they were actually following the instructions of the defendants.\n\nThey placed more than 1,000 fraudulent listings for automobiles, motorcycles and other highpriced goods on eBay and similar auction sites. Photos of the items were infected with\nmalware, which redirected computers that clicked on the image to fictitious webpages\ndesigned by the defendants to resemble legitimate eBay pages.\n\nThese fictitious webpages prompted users to pay for their goods through a nonexistent\n“eBay Escrow Agent” who was simply a person hired by the defendants. Users paid for the\ngoods to the fraudulent escrow agents, who in turn wired the money to others in Eastern\nEurope, who in turn gave it to the defendants. The payers/victims never received the items\nand never got their money back.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis resulted in a loss of millions of dollars.\n\nThe Bayrob group laundered this money by hiring “money transfer agents” and created\nfictitious companies with fraudulent websites designed to give the impression they were\nactual businesses engaged in legitimate financial transactions. Money stolen from victims\nwas wired to these fraudulent companies and then in turn wired to Western Union or Money\nGram offices in Romania. European “money mules” used fake identity documents to collect\nthe money and deliver it to the defendants.\n\nThe FBI investigated the case, with assistance from the Romanian National Police. Senior\nCounsel Brian Levine of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property\nSection (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Duncan T. Brown and Brian McDonough of\nthe Northern District of Ohio prosecuted the case. The Office of International Affairs also\nprovided assistance in this case.\n\n\n-----",
