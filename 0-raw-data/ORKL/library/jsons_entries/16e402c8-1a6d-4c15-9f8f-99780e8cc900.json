We found that Predator\npersists after reboot using the iOS automations feature.\nWe conducted Internet scanning for Predator spyware servers and found likely Predator customers in Armenia, Egypt, Greece,\nIndonesia, Madagascar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Serbia.\nCytrox was reported to be part of [Intellexa, the](https://intellexa.com/) [so-called “Star Alliance of spyware,” which was formed to compete with NSO Group,](https://gizmodo.com/the-lucrative-government-spyware-industry-has-a-new-one-1832568791)\nand which describes itself as “EU-based and regulated, with six sites and R&D labs throughout Europe.”\n\n## 1.

Cytrox, a Part of the “Intellexa Alliance”\n\nThe following section is not a complete accounting of the relationship between Cytrox and other entities. It is based on a review of a mix\nof media reports and a nonexhaustive review of company registries across various jurisdictions. Additional research into Intellexa and the\ncompanies that form this marketing alliance could potentially provide useful insight into how commercial surveillance companies employ\ncomplex business structures and use measures that obfuscate their operations.\n\n**The Link between Cytrox and Intellexa**\n\nCytrox is [part of the so-called “Intellexa alliance,” a marketing label for a range of mercenary surveillance vendors that emerged in 2019.](https://www.fastcompany.com/90369108/inside-the-shadowy-world-of-spyware-makers-that-target-activists-and-dissidents)\nThe consortium of companies includes Nexa Technologies (formerly Amesys), WiSpear/Passitora Ltd., Cytrox, and Senpai, along with\nother unnamed entities, purportedly seeking to compete against other players in the cyber surveillance market such as NSO Group and\nVerint.\n\n[Originally based in Cyprus, a recent report indicates that Intellexa now operates from Greece, which is also listed as the LinkedIn location](https://www.intelligenceonline.com/surveillance--interception/2021/10/28/cyberintelligence-firm-intellexa-makes-paris-appearance-with-orion,109701542-art)\nof its [founder, Dilian.

In reviewing filings in the Israeli business registry, we observed a 2020 transfer of all shares held by Cytrox Holdings Zrt (Hungary)\nin Cytrox EMEA Ltd./Balinese Ltd. (Israel) to Aliada Group Inc., an entity registered in the British Virgin Islands (registration no. 1926732).\nPrior to this share transfer, Cytrox Holdings Zrt appears to have been the sole shareholder of shares in Cytrox EMEA Ltd./Balinese and\nafter this share transfer it seems to remain the sole shareholder in Cytrox Software Ltd./Peterbald. Further, an article from Intelligence\n_Online in 2017_ [notes that WiSpear Systems is “owned by Aliada Group Inc.”](https://www.intelligenceonline.com/surveillance--interception/2017/09/20/with-wispear-gsm-interception-champion-tal-dilian-gets-into-wifi,108262318-art)\n\nInformation on Aliada Group Inc. is relatively scant. The same 2017 article from Intelligence Online notes that Aliada Group Inc. is\n“backed by the private equity firm Mivtach-Shamir, which spent $3.5 million to acquire a 32% stake in Aliada in December 2016, along\n[with an option to acquire an additional 5%.” Mivtach-Shamir is “a publicly-traded Israeli investment company” founded by Meir Shamir. In](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mivtach-shamir-holdings-ltd)\nreviewing entries for WiSpear/Passitora Ltd. in Cyprus’ business registry, we noted that “Mivtah Shamir Technologies (2000) Ltd.” is listed\nas a director of Passitora Ltd., along with Dilian. We also found an entry in the Israeli business registry for a “Mivtach Shamir\nTechnologies (2000) Ltd.,” which was apparently incorporated in 2000.\n\nFurther, a 2020 Haaretz [article noted that Avi Rubinstein, a “high-tech entrepreneur, filed a lawsuit against Dilian in Tel Aviv District](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/tech-news/.premium.HIGHLIGHT.MAGAZINE-a-shady-israeli-intel-genius-his-cyber-spy-van-and-million-dollar-deals-1.9413973)\nCourt.” 4 According to Haaretz, Aliada Group Inc. is described in the litigation as “a group of cyberweapon companies whose products are\nbranded under the name Intellexa.” Two other individuals, Oz Liv, who was also a commander in Unit 81, and Meir Shamir, are also\nnamed as defendants. According to Haaretz, these two individuals, along with Rubinstein, who filed the suit, and Dilian, are all\nshareholders in Aliada Group Inc.\n\n_Haaretz further notes that Rubinstein is accusing Dilian, Liv, and Shamir of acting “illegally to dilute [Rubinstein’s] own shares through a_\n_pyramid of companies set up overseas. Some of those companies were established via front men connected to Dilian, including his_\n_second wife, Sara Hamou” (as noted above, Hamou’s name appears in corporate registry listings in the Dun & Bradstreet database for_\nIntellexa entities in Ireland and Greece). The lawsuit also reportedly claimed that “this transfer of Aliada’s activities out of Israel via shell\n_companies, first to the British Virgin Islands and later Ireland, violated both Israeli and foreign defense export control laws.”_\n\nAccording to the BVI Registrar of Corporate Affairs, as of the date of publication of this report, Aliada Group Inc.’s legal status is “in\npenalty” due to nonpayment of annual fees. In addition, the registered agent filed an intent to resign on November 12, 2021. The reason\nfor the resignation is as yet unclear.\n\n**Intellexa’s Products**\n\nA [prior version of the Intellexa website markets “intelligence solutions” including “tactical interception.” The marketing of interception was](https://web.archive.org/web/20211004210723/https://intellexa.com/)\n[also underscored in Dilian’s 2019 Forbes interview. However, at the time of writing, the website is considerably more vague about the](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/08/05/a-multimillionaire-surveillance-dealer-steps-out-of-the-shadows-and-his-9-million-whatsapp-hacking-van/?sh=27618a2f31b7)\ncompany’s activities. In its current form, Intellexa’s website and associated videos pitch a product called “Nebula” which is described as a\n‘holistic’ intelligence gathering and analysis platform.\n\nFigure 3: Text from the Intellexa website at time of writing.\nThe company’s website prominently features the claim that it is “EU-based and regulated.” This claim is interesting given the track record\nof some of Intellexa’s participating corporate entities, which have been riddled with legal issues and other controversy. For example, in\n[June 2021, executives of Amesys and Nexa Technologies were indicted by investigating judges with the crimes against humanity and war](https://www.fidh.org/en/region/north-africa-middle-east/egypt/surveillance-and-torture-in-egypt-and-libya-amesys-and-nexa)\n\n\n-----\n\ncrimes unit of the Paris Judicial Court for complicity in torture in relation to product sales to the Libyan government and complicity in\ntorture and forced dissapearance in relation to product sales to the Egyptian government.\n\n[Dilian has also been followed by reports of legal and other irregularities, both during his time in the Israeli military and in his new career](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-cyprus-israel-spies-arab-world-cyber-something-wrong-1.8317030)\n[as a mercenary surveillance tech vendor.

Attacks against the Two Targets\n\nNour first became suspicious after observing that his iPhone was “running hot.” We learned of Nour’s case and reviewed logs from his\nphone. Ultimately, we determined that his device had been exploited and infected with two separate mercenary spyware tools: Pegasus\nspyware, made by NSO Group, and Predator, which is developed by Cytrox.\n\nWe attribute the attacks on the two targets to the Egyptian Government with medium-high confidence. We conducted scanning (Section\n4) that identified the Egyptian Government as a Cytrox Predator customer, websites used in the hacks of the two targets bore Egyptian\nthemes, and the messages that initiated the hack were sent from Egyptian WhatsApp numbers (Section 2.5, Section 2.7).\n\n### 2.1. Confirming NSO Pegasus Infection of Ayman Nour\n\nThe logs showed that Nour’s phone had been repeatedly compromised with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware since March 3, 2021. For\nexample, evidence of execution of the following processes was identified on Nour’s phone, dating back to March 3, 2021:\n\n```\n/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/tisppd/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/bfrgbd\n\n```\n```\n/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/xpccfd\n\n```\n```\n/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/comsercvd\n\n```\n```\n/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/rlaccountd\n/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/launchrexd\n/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/ckeblld\n/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/comnetd\n\n```\n```\n/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/accountpfd\n\n```\n```\n/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/jlmvskrd\n/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/msgacntd\n/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/brstaged\n\n```\n```\n/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/fdlibframed\n\n```\n\nThese process names all appear on a list of Pegasus indicators published by Amnesty Tech and we have also independently linked them\nto Pegasus. Crash logs also showed that on June 30, 2021, NSO Group’s **_[FORCEDENTRY](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-into-nso-zero-click.html)_** exploit (CVE-2021-30860) was fired at the\nphone. The exploit did not result in installation of the Pegasus spyware at this time.\n\nBased on the traces of FORCEDENTRY, the presence of process names linked to Pegasus, and additional factors, we conclude with\nhigh confidence that the phone was repeatedly hacked with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware starting on March 3, 2021.\n\n### 2.2. Confirming Cytrox Predator Infection of Ayman Nour\n\nAfter confirming forensic traces of Pegasus on Nour’s iPhone, we identified the presence of additional spyware, which we attribute with\nhigh confidence to Cytrox. We further conclude with high confidence that it is unrelated to Pegasus spyware.\n\nWhile examining the iPhone logs we determined that, on June 30, 2021, two commands `“/Payload2” were running on the phone (PIDs`\n339 and 1272), and that these commands had been launched with a single argument, a URL on `distedc[.]com . The commands were`\nrunning as root.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Listing of commands running on Nour’s phone.\niPhone logs indicated that the process names of the commands were UserEventAgent and com.apple.WebKit.Networking, that their\nbinaries were resident on disk in the /private/var/tmp/ folder, and that the responsible process for both was siriactionsd, which is a\nlegitimate iOS process that manages iOS shortcuts and automations.\n\nFigure 5: Phone logs showing process names of the commands, and paths to binaries on disk.\nWhile iOS has legitimate binaries with the names “com.apple.WebKit.Networking” and “UserEventAgent”, the binaries in Figures 5 do not\nmatch any known legitimate Apple version. Moreover, the legitimate iOS binaries with these names are not stored in\n```\n/private/var/tmp/ . The two suspicious processes were running as part of the\n\n```\n“ com.apple.WorkflowKit.BackgroundShortcutRunner ” launchd coalition. We found two additional suspicious processes that had\nrecently run in this same coalition, named “hooker” and “takePhoto”.\n\n### 2.3. Attribution to Cytrox\n\n[We looked up the IP address for distedc[.]com on Internet scanning service Censys and found that, as of October 2021, it returned an](https://censys.io/)\nHTTP 302 redirect to [https://duckduckgo.com. Concluding that this might be an identifying behavior, we built a](https://duckduckgo.com/) [Censys fingerprint for the](https://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&per_page=25&virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE&q=services.http.response.body_hash%3A%60sha1%3A8490a34ab83d79b3b5f66dbd4484438717b6dca7%60+and+services.http.response.headers.access_control_allow_origin%3A%60*%60)\nredirect.\n\nWe found 28 hosts on Censys matching this fingerprint in October 2021, including an IP in Northern Macedonia, `62.162.5[.]58, which`\nwas pointed to by `dev-bh.cytrox[.]com in August 2020, and which also returned a redirect with` `dev-bh.cytrox[.]com in its`\n[Location header on port 80 during this period.](https://www.shodan.io/host/62.162.5.58/history#80)\n\nAdditionally, passive DNS tool [RiskIQ shows that the IP 62.162.5[.]58 returned a certificate](https://www.riskiq.com/)\n(0fb1b8da5f2e63da70b0ab3bba8438f30708282f) for teslal[.]xyz between July 2020 and September 2020. Since `62.162.5[.]58`\ncurrently returns a `teslal[.]xyz certificate, we assume that the IP has not changed ownership since August 2020 and is thus still`\nrelated to `cytrox[.]com .`\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Cytrox WordPress page from 2019, after apparent hacking and the placement of an SEO-link for an online casino.\n[The cytrox.com domain previously returned a WordPress page containing an email address (ivo@cytrox.com), which appears to be the](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:ivo@cytrox.com)\nemail of Ivo Malinkovski, CEO of Cytrox. The WordPress page is apparently unmaintained, and was apparently hacked to include spam\nlinks to an online casino (Figure 6).\n\nWe analyzed binaries associated with the spyware (Section 3), which revealed that the spyware is named “Predator.” We performed\nadditional fingerprinting and scanning (Section 4) that allowed us to identify additional components of Cytrox client infrastructure.\n\n### 2.4. Observation of Additional Domains\n\nIn addition to distedc[.]com, we observed additional domains associated with the Predator installation on the two victim phones.\n\n**Domain** **Where Seen**\n\ndistedc[.]com As argument to running Predator process in system logs; in iOS\nautomation for Predator persistence\n\ngosokm[.]com iOS system logs for running Predator processes showed data\nexfiltration here\n\n\nyoutubesyncapi[.]com\nbity[.]ws\n\n\nPredator configuration echoed to system logs\n\n\negyqaz[.]com Within Android Predator sample downloaded from distedc[.]com;\nSafari history of compromised device\n\n\nalmasryelyuom[.]com\nqwxzyl[.]com\n\n\nSafari history of compromised device timestamped ~1ms before\negyqaz[.]com\n\n\n**Table 1: Domains observed in Predator spyware used to hack Egyptian targets.**\n\n### 2.5. How Ayman Nour was Hacked with Predator\n\nWe searched Nour’s phone for these domains and found that an Egyptian number on WhatsApp (+201201407978), purporting to be a\n“Dr. Rania Shhab,” sent four distinct links to almasryelyuom[.]com and qwxzyl[.]com to Nour’s device. The links were sent as images\ncontaining URLs. The same WhatsApp account sent a link to youtu-be[.]net, which we assess is also related, because the server\nresponse for youtu-be[.]net matches that of almasryelyuom[.]com and qwxzyl[.]com.\n\nThe following are examples of images accompanying the links sent by the attacker extracted from Nour’s phone:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: An image accompanying a Cytrox Predator link sent to Nour reads: “Turkey asks the Egyptian opposition channels to stop\ncriticizing Egypt, and Cairo comments on the move…”\n\nFigure 8: An image accompanying a Cytrox Predator link sent to Nour reads: “The moment a car fell from the top of the [6th] October\nBridge in Ramses.”\n\nFigure 9: An image accompanying a Cytrox Predator link sent to Nour purports to be a link to the legitimate website of the Al Masry Al\nYoum newspaper. The actual link goes to a fake lookalike domain, almasryelyuom[.]com.\n\nFigure 10: An image accompanying a Cytrox Predator link sent to Nour reads: “Breaking news.. Alexandria train accident today. Full\ndetails…”\n\n### 2.6. Evidence of Predator and Pegasus Running Simultaneously\n\nPhone logs indicate that on June 22, 2021, Pegasus and Predator were running simultaneously on Nour’s phone, as these four\nprocesses were observed running simultaneously:\n\n**PID** **Process** **Spyware**\n\n4219 `/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/launchrexd` Pegasus\n\n\n-----\n\n**PID** **Process** **Spyware**\n\n4412 `/private/var/tmp/com.apple.WebKit.Networking` Predator\n\n**Table 2: Pegasus and Predator processes running simultaneously on Nour’s phone on June 22, 2021.**\n\nThe phone logs indicate that the device was infected with Pegasus on June 22 at 13:26 GMT. A number of Library/SMS/Attachments\nfolders were created between 13:17 and 13:21, and there were no entries whatsoever in the Attachments table of the sms.db file for June\n22, suggesting that a zero-click exploit may have been the vector for Pegasus installation. Approximately an hour later, a Predator link\nsent to Nour on WhatsApp was opened in Safari at 14:33 GMT on the same day and Predator was installed on the device two minutes\nlater at 14:35 GMT.\n\n### 2.7. How Second Target was Hacked with Predator\n\nThe second target, an Egyptian journalist in exile who is the host of a popular news program, received one message on WhatsApp from\nan unknown number (+201201407595) with a link to the same almasryelyuom[.]com website.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: Second target is targeted with Predator.\nThe individual who sent the link claimed that they were an Assistant Editor at the Al Masry Al Youm newspaper.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 3. Analysis of Cytrox s Predator Spyware\n\nWe obtained Android and iOS payloads from distedc[.]com and found them to be copies of a loader for a spyware product called\nPredator. We believe that these payloads are invoked by a previous exploit phase that we do not have.\n\n### 3.1. Initialization\n\nThe iPhone executable is a 64-bit Mach-O binary which, like its Android counterpart, expects two arguments when the binary’s `main`\nfunction is called, which appear to be a kernel process task port and a pid value. The `main function then calls` `kmem_init with these`\nvalues, which proceeds to enable Predator stage 1 for continued execution. The Android sample passes its arguments to shared\nconstants `SHMEMFD_VSS and` `SHMEMFD_VSS .`\n\nBoth the iOS and Android samples then call a `startPy function to load a bundled Python 2.7 runtime. In the iOS sample, two additional`\nbuilt-in objects are added to the runtime: `predutils and predconfig. The Android sample contains further additional built-in objects:`\ninjector, pc2, recorder, and voip_recorder. Upon initialization, startPy loads a frozen Python module named loader which begins by\nimporting the Predator config from the interpreter’s predconfig module.\n\nThe iOS and Android configurations are slightly different. The complete configurations are available in Appendix 1. Once Predator iOS\nloads its configuration, it loads another frozen Python module named km_ios, a utility module that provides kernel memory management\nhelper functions enabling additional Predator module capabilities.\n\nThe iOS payload also contains a _check function, which queries the phone number and the phone’s current locale country code. If the\nlocale country code is equal to “IL” (the country code for Israel), or the phone number begins with “+972” (the telephone country code for\nIsrael) then the spyware terminates. However, the method that Predator uses to query the phone number,\nCTSettingCopyMyPhoneNumber, may not work in recent versions of iOS. We could not determine how (or if) the _check function is\ncalled.\n\n### 3.2. Python Loader\n\nIn addition to the frozen loader module, “src/loader.py” (“frozenpyc/src/loader.py” in the Android sample), we also found copies of what\nappear to be older versions of the module that do not appear to be invoked by Predator: “src/loader2.py”, “src/loader_real.py” and\n“src/loaderBackup03”. All of the loader versions contain multiple references to “Predator.”\n\nFigure 12: An excerpt of code from the loader module that mentions “Predator.”\nAfter loading the Predator configuration, the iOS loader then wipes the device’s crash logs by removing all files in\n“/private/var/mobile/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/”. Then, it downloads a configuration file and additional stages of the spyware from the\nserver (specified by predconfig’s INS_URL parameter, which is set to https://bity[.]ws).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13: Predator on iOS wipes the crash logs.\nOn Android, the loader module also downloads additional files from the server (specified by predconfig’s INS_URL parameter, which is\nset to https://egyqaz[.]com).\n\n### 3.3. Persistence on iOS\n\nOn iOS, the loader calls a get_configuration_persistency function, which downloads an iOS shortcuts automation from the spyware server\nto ensure persistence. The persistent payload is referred to as “Nahum,” which is the name of a minor biblical prophet. Nahum’s prophecy\nappears in the Hebrew Tanakh and the Christian Old Testament, and foretells the total destruction of Nineveh, a powerful fortress city.\n\n_Nineveh is destroyed, deserted, desolate! Hearts melt with fear; knees tremble, strength is gone; faces grow pale. Where now is the_\n_city that was like a den of lions, the place where young lions were fed, where the lion and the lioness would go and their cubs would_\n_be safe?_\n\nNahum 2:10-11 GNB\n\nThe iOS automation is triggered when certain apps are opened, including a number of built-in Apple apps, such as the App Store,\nCamera, Mail, Maps, Safari, as well as third-party apps including Twitter, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, LinkedIn, Skype, SnapChat,\nViber, Wire, TikTok, Line, OpenVPN, WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram.\n\nFigure 14: Automation on Target 2’s infected device as viewed in the “Automations” tab of the “Shortcuts” app.\nThe automation first checks if the phone’s battery level is greater than 9% (i.e., if the phone is not in a low-battery situation). If the phone’s\nbattery level is adequate, then the automation downloads JavaScript code from the spyware server and substitutes this code into a block\nof HTML contained in the shortcut. We were unable to obtain this JavaScript code. The HTML in the shortcut also contains a JavaScript\nfunction “make_bogus_transform” which appears to create an XSLT transformation that may be invoked by the downloaded JavaScript\n\n\n-----\n\ncode. The HTML code with the substituted JavaScript is then Base64 encoded, its contents are prepended with data:text/html, and then\nthe automation passes this URL to WebKit to render. This presumably triggers the exploit and results in the installation of the Predator\nspyware.\n\nWhile automations normally trigger visible notifications when they are run, the Predator shortcut runs entirely in the background, invisible\nto the user, because Predator also changes an option to disable automations from triggering notifications.\n\nThe get_configuration_persistency function also downloads an iOS profile named “com.[name redacted].disable-shortcuts-notifications”,\nfrom the spyware server.\n\nWe located a profile with the same name publicly released by [name redacted], a software engineering student. We are redacting the\nname of the student here because we do not believe they are involved in Cytrox Predator development. The profile’s sole function is to\nprevent iOS from displaying notifications when an automation is run. Thus, users who have been hacked with Predator do not see\nnotifications when the spyware is launched.\n\nFigure 15: Profile to disable automations notifications used by Predator.\nThere is nothing particularly special or complex about this specific profile, and Predator’s developers could have easily crafted their own\nsimilar profile that duplicated this functionality without mentioning the software engineering student by name.\n\nThe get_configuration_persistency function also downloads binaries called “takePhoto,” “agent.dylib,” “inject,” and “hooker” on iOS14, but\ndoes not download these files on iOS13, instead logging the message “iOS 13, don’t need hooker.” We did not obtain these files, but we\nbelieve that “hooker” and “takePhoto” are the same binaries we saw running in Section 2.2.\n\n### 3.4. Additional Android Details\n\nWe did not find a mechanism for persistence on Android, nor values in the Android configuration file that indicate persistence support.\nHowever, we found some additional code in the Android sample, including code to disable SELinux and code for an audio recording\ncomponent.\n\nPredator stores additional Python modules and native ELF binaries in the fs.db SQLite file which is located at the path set in DB_FILE.\nThe Python interpreter has a frozen module called sqlimper which is responsible for interacting with this database. The database contains\na table called files which has a column called file_hash and a column called file_data. The file_hash is used in place of a file name and is\ncomputed using the following routine, where n is the name:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe injector module declares one function, inject, which can inject a shared object into a running process. Interestingly, there is a function\ncalled prior to injection which attempts to disable SELinux enforcement via the SELinuxFS.\n\nIt should be noted that this approach likely will not succeed on devices that have additional checks and protections around SELinux\nenforcement—for example, Samsung RKP. However, there are artifacts associated with Predator that suggest approaches like RKP can\nbe defeated by stomping on the SELinux access vector cache entries to grant the needed permissions.\n\nThe pc2 module contains a single function, pc2_send_command, that is used as an IPC mechanism to send commands to Predator’s\naudio recording component. The supported commands are START_VOIP, STOP_VOIP, START_MICRORECORDER,\nSTOP_MICRORECORDER, and POLL_VOIP. This module works in conjunction with the recorder and voip_recorder modules. Each of\nthe recorder modules have a start and stop function which are used to start/stop Predator’s hot mic (recorder) and call recording\n(voip_recorder) capabilities. Recordings are stored in /data/local/tmp/wd/r/ in MP3 format.\n\n## 4. Scanning to Find Cytrox Customers\n\nWe fingerprinted the behavior of the domains from Table 1 and found additional domains via Shodan and Censys.\n\n**Domains** **Fingerprint**\n\n\nalmasryelyuom[.]com\nqwxzyl[.]com\n\nyoutu-be[.]net\n\n\n\n[[Shodan,](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=ssl.jarm%3A%2229d29d15d29d29d00042d42d000000038eaaf490bec8dc33757f165ce01762%22+http.html_hash%3A372213971+Access-Control-Allow-Origin) [Censys]](https://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&per_page=25&virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE&q=services.jarm.fingerprint%3A%6029d29d15d29d29d00042d42d000000038eaaf490bec8dc33757f165ce01762%60+and+services.http.response.body_hash%3A%60sha1%3A01b1df0ce8e76f49129f112be3fb0cdfef696818%60+and+services.http.response.headers.access_control_allow_origin%3A%60*%60)\n\n\negyqaz[.]com [[Shodan,](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=http.html_hash%3A-1759424475+access-control-allow-origin) [Censys]](https://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&per_page=25&virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE&q=services.http.response.body_hash%3A%60sha1%3A65973405857b3df07f2189bd4ed46aed34e57154%60+and+services.http.response.headers.access_control_allow_origin%3A%60*%60)\n\ndistedc[.]com [[Shodan,](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=http.html_hash%3A-681485527+access-control-allow-origin) [Censys]](https://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&per_page=25&virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE&q=services.http.response.body_hash%3A%60sha1%3A8490a34ab83d79b3b5f66dbd4484438717b6dca7%60+and+services.http.response.headers.access_control_allow_origin%3A%60*%60)\n\ngosokm[.]com [[Shodan,](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=http.html_hash%3A430832470+utf-8) [Censys]](https://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&per_page=25&virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE&q=services.http.response.body_hash%3A%60sha1%3A803f8750b5bb6661d45f4cb52db84567ae8c34b1%60+and+services.http.response.headers.Content_Type%3A%60text%2Fhtml%3B+charset%3Dutf-8%60)\n\n\nyoutubesyncapi[.]com\nbity[.]ws\n\n\n\n[[Shodan,](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=http.html_hash%3A-1826349220+access-control-allow-origin) [Censys]](https://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&per_page=25&virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE&q=services.http.response.body_hash%3A%60sha1%3A30f7f162d392247afc106a622e9bee9092c2677a%60+and+services.http.response.headers.access_control_allow_origin%3A%60*%60)\n\n\n**Table 3: Shodan and Censys fingerprints for Cytrox domains.**\n\nOf the Shodan and Censys results, we identified several servers that returned HTTP Server headers with the value “Server,” rather than\n“nginx,” These servers were typically hosted on consumer broadband connections available to local subscribers only, rather than cloudhosting services that can be procured internationally. We believe that the “Server: Server” IPs on consumer broadband connections are\n_endpoint IPs that indicate locations of customers. We found endpoint IPs in the following countries, so we conclude that these_\ngovernments are likely among Cytrox’s customers:\n\n\n-----\n\nArmenia, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Madagascar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Serbia\n\nScanning also reveals a range of domains used by Cytrox that have country-specific themes, which leads us to suspect that they may be\nspecifically targeted in relation to these countries. We list a subset of these in Table 4.\n\n**Country Theme** **Cytrox Domain**\n\nEgypt aramexegypt[.]com\nalmasryelyuom[.]com\n\nalraeesnews[.]net\n\nbank-alahly.com\n\ncarrefourmisr[.]com\n\neg-gov[.]org\n\negyqaz[.]com\n\netisalategypt.tech\n\nikea-egypt[.]net\n\norangegypt[.]co\n\nsinai-new[.]com\n\nuberegypt.cn[.]com\n\nvodafoneegypt[.]tech\n\nyallakora-egy.com\n\nyuom7[.]net\n\nIvory Coast adibjan[.]net\npolitique-koaci[.]info\n\nMadagascar tribune-mg[.]xyz\n\nMali actumali[.]org\n\nSaudi Arabia niceonase[.]com\nniceonesa[.]net\n\nSerbia novosti[.]bid\npolitika[.]bid\n\nTrinidad & Tobago forwardeshoptt[.]com\nguardian-tt[.]me\n\n**Table 4: Some Cytrox Predator domains indicating country themes.**\n\nWe additionally identified further domains impersonating popular companies and online sites (Table 5).\n\n**Legitimate Service** **Cytrox Domain**\n\nApple applepps[.]com\n\nFox News ffoxnewz[.]com\n\nGoogle Play Store playestore[.]net\n\nInstagram instegram[.]co\n\nLinkedIn lnkedin[.]org\n\nSephora sephoragroup[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\n**Legitimate Service** **Cytrox Domain**\n\nTesla Motors teslal[.]shop\nteslal[.]xyz\n\nTwitter twtter[.]net\ntw.itter[.]me\n\nWhatsApp wha.tsapp[.]me\n\nXNXX xnxx-hub[.]com\n\nYouTube youtu-be[.]net\nyoutub[.]app\n\nyoutubewatch[.]co\n\n**Table 5: Some Cytrox Predator domains impersonating legitimate companies or websites.**\n\n### Special Note: Predator after Pegasus for Saudi Arabia?\n\nAn IP address in Saudi Arabia appears to have begun matching our Cytrox Predator fingerprints at the end of July 2021, and we classify\nthis IP address as that of a likely Predator customer. NSO Group’s June 30, 2021 transparency report mentions that NSO cut off a client,\n[later reported to be Saudi Arabia by the New York Times, apparently in response to the revelations of spying on Al Jazeera journalists.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/17/world/middleeast/israel-saudi-khashoggi-hacking-nso.html)\nThis may be an indication that Saudi Arabia has switched from Pegasus to Predator.\n\n## 5. Disclosure & Enforcement\n\nIn accordance with the Citizen Lab’s vulnerability disclosure policy, we shared copies of Cytrox Predator forensic artifacts with Apple,\nwhich has confirmed to the Citizen Lab that they are investigating. In addition, given the abuse of WhatsApp for Predator targeting, the\nCitizen Lab shared forensic artifacts with Meta’s security team.\n\nToday, Thursday, December 16th, Meta is taking an enforcement action against Cytrox, which includes removing approximately 300\nFacebook and Instagram accounts linked to Cytrox. Their investigation also reveals an extensive list of lookalike domains used as part of\n[social engineering and malware attacks, which are included in Appendix A of their report.](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/taking-action-against-surveillance-for-hire/)\n\nThe Meta report states that they believe Cytrox customers include entities in Egypt, Armenia, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Colombia,\nCôte d’Ivoire, Vietnam, Philippines, and Germany, and that they identified additional abusive targeting initiated by Cytrox customers\naround the world.\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\nThis report is the first investigation to discover Cytrox’s mercenary spyware being abused to target civil society. Remarkably, one of the\nvictims was simultaneously infected with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. NSO Group has received outsized publicity in recent years,\nthanks to a growing customer list, spiraling abuse problems, and groundbreaking investigative work by civil society. Cytrox and its\nPredator spyware, meanwhile, are relatively unknown.\n\nThe targeting of a single individual with both Pegasus and Predator underscores that the practice of hacking civil society transcends any\nspecific mercenary spyware company. Instead, it is a pattern that we expect will persist as long as autocratic governments are able to\nobtain sophisticated hacking technology. Absent international and domestic regulations and safeguards, journalists, human rights\ndefenders, and opposition groups will continue to be hacked into the foreseeable future.\n\n### The Mercenary Spyware Ecosystem\n\nBoth the [Citizen Lab and Amnesty International’s](https://citizenlab.ca/tag/nso-group/) [Security Lab have produced extensive technical reports on NSO Group. While](https://www.amnesty.org/en/search/NSO%20Group/)\nprominent, the mercenary spyware firm was not the first nor is it the only spyware firm of its kind whose technology has been linked to\n[abuse problems. In fact, the market for offensive intrusion capabilities is large, varied, and proliferating internationally.](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/surveillance-technology-at-the-fair/)\n\nFor example, prior to the Citizen Lab’s [first report on NSO Group in 2016, we documented extensive abuses of Hacking Team and](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/)\n[FinFisher mercenary spyware. (Hacking Team was subsequently rebranded Memento Labs in 2019.) In 2017, we published a report on](https://citizenlab.ca/2015/10/mapping-finfishers-continuing-proliferation/)\nthe spyware firm, Cyberbit, whose technology was used by Ethiopia to mount a global cyber espionage campaign. We also discovered\nevidence that Cyberbit was marketing its spyware to known human rights abusers, including the Royal Thai Army, the Uzbek secret\nservices, Vietnam, Kazakhstan, Rwanda, Serbia, and Nigeria. Earlier this year, we published a report on yet another spyware firm,\n\n\n-----\n\n[Candiru, with our findings independently corroborated by Microsoft,](https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/) [Google, and the](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/how-we-protect-users-0-day-attacks/) [threat intelligence team at ESET.

These practices frustrate investigation, regulation, and accountability. Mercenary spyware companies further evade\noutside scrutiny by employing complex accounting and incorporation techniques familiar to those used by arms traffickers, money\nlaunderers, kleptocrats, and corrupt officials.\n\nAs investigative journalists and public interest researchers continue to put a spotlight on mercenary spyware companies, we expect they\nwill continue their efforts to evade scrutiny and accountability.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to to M.S. and Ayman Nour.
