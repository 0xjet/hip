Here at Symantec\nSecurity Response, we’ve been keeping our eyes on a group that we believe are among the\nbest of breed. We’ve given them the name of Hidden Lynx—after a string that was found in\nthe command and control server communications. This group has a hunger and drive that\nsurpass other well-known groups such as APT1/Comment Crew. Key characteristics of this\ngroup are:\n\ntechnical prowess\nagility\norganized\nsheer resourcefulness\npatience\n\nThese attributes are shown by the relentless campaigns waged against multiple concurrent\ntargets over a sustained period of time. They are the pioneers of the “watering hole”\ntechnique used to ambush targets, they have early access to zero-day vulnerabilities, and\nthey have the tenacity and patience of an intelligent hunter to compromise the supply chain\nto get at the true target. These supply chain attacks are carried out by infecting computers at\na supplier of an intended target and then waiting for the infected computers to be installed\nand call home, clearly these are cool calculated actions rather than impulsive forays of\namateurs.\n\nThis group doesn’t just limit itself to a handful of targets; instead it targets hundreds of\ndifferent organizations in many different regions, even concurrently. Given the breadth and\nnumber of targets and regions involved, we infer that this group is most likely a professional\nhacker-for-hire operation that are contracted by clients to provide information. They steal on\ndemand, whatever their clients are interested in, hence the wide variety and range of targets.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also believe that to carry out attacks of this scale, the group must have considerable\nhacking expertise at its disposal, perhaps 50 to 100 operatives are employed and organized\ninto at least two distinct teams both tasked with carrying out different activities using different\ntools and techniques. These types of attacks require time and effort to carry out, some of the\ncampaigns require research and intelligence gathering before any successful attacks can be\nmounted.\n\nAt the front line of this group is a team that uses disposable tools along with basic but\neffective techniques to attack many different targets. They may also act as intelligence\n[collectors too. This team we call Team Moudoor after the name of the Trojan that they use.](https://web.archive.org/web/20130920000343/http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-100817-2451-99)\nMoudoor is a back door Trojan that the team uses liberally without worry about discovery by\nsecurity firms. The other team acts like a special operations unit, elite personnel used to\n[crack the most valuable or toughest targets. The elite team uses a Trojan named Naid and](https://web.archive.org/web/20130920000343/http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-061518-4639-99)\nare therefore referred to as Team Naid. Unlike Moudoor, the Naid Trojan is used sparingly\nand with care to avoid detection and capture, like a secret weapon that is only used when\nfailure is not an option.\n\nSince 2011, we have observed at least six significant campaigns by this group. The most\n[notable of these campaigns is the VOHO attack campaign of June, 2012. What was](https://web.archive.org/web/20130920000343/http://www.eweek.com/security/government-agencies-utilities-among-targets-of-voho-cyber-spy-attacks/)\nparticularly interesting about this attack was the use of the watering hole attack technique\nand the compromise of Bit9’s trusted file signing infrastructure. The VOHO campaign was\nultimately targeting US defense contractors whose systems were protected by Bit9’s trustbased protection software but when the Hidden Lynx attackers’ progress was blocked by this\nobstacle, they reconsidered their options and found that the best way around the protection\nwas to compromise the heart of the protection system itself and subvert it for their own\npurpose. This is exactly what they did when they diverted their attention to Bit9 and breached\ntheir systems. Once breached, the attackers quickly found their way into the file signing\ninfrastructure that was the foundation of the Bit9 protection model, they then used this\nsystem to sign a number of malware files and then these files were used in turn to\ncompromise the true intended targets.\n\n[For those interested in more in-depth information, we have published a whitepaper that](https://web.archive.org/web/20130920000343/http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/hidden_lynx.pdf)\ndescribes the group and the attack campaigns carried out by them.\n\nWe have also put together an infographic that summarizes the key information about this\nprolific Hidden Lynx group.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nBlog Entry Filed Under:\n\n\n-----",
