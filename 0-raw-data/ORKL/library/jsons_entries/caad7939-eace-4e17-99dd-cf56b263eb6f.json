As a](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/glossary/advanced-persistent-threat-apt/)\nrefresher, APTs are prolonged, aimed attacks on specific targets with the intention to\ncompromise their systems and gain information from or about that target.\n\nWhile the targets may be anyone or anything—a person, business, or other organization—\nAPTs are often associated with government or military operations, as they tend to be the\norganizations with the resources necessary to conduct such an attack. Starting with\nMandiant’s APT1 report in 2013, there’s been a continuous stream of exposure of nationstate hacking at scale.\n\nCybersecurity companies have gotten relatively good at observing and analyzing the tools\nand tactics of nation-state threat actors; they’re less good at placing these actions in context\nsufficient enough for defenders to make solid risk assessments. So we’re going to take a\nlook at a few APT groups from a broader perspective and see how they fit into the larger\nthreat landscape.\n\nToday, we’re going to review the activities of Lazarus group, alternatively named Hidden\nCobra and Guardians of Peace.\n\n## Who is Lazarus Group?\n\n\n-----\n\nLazarus Group is commonly believed to be run by the North Korean government, motivated\nprimarily by financial gain as a method of circumventing long-standing sanctions against the\n[regime. They first came to substantial media notice in 2013 with a series of coordinated](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/world/asia/south-korea-computer-network-crashes.html)\nattacks against an assortment of South Korean broadcasters and financial institutions using\n[DarkSeoul, a wiper program that overwrites sections of the victims’ Master Boot Record.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/glossary/master-boot-record-mbr/)\n\n[In November 2014, a large scale breach of Sony Pictures was attributed to Lazarus. The](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack)\nattack was notable due to its substantial penetration across Sony networks, the extensive\namount of data exfiltrated and leaked, as well of use of a wiper in a possible attempt to erase\nforensic evidence. Attribution on the attacks was largely hazy, but the FBI released a\nstatement tying the Sony breach to the earlier DarkSeoul attack, and officially attributed both\nincidents to North Korea.\n\n[Fast forward to May 2017 with the widespread outbreak of WannaCry, a piece of](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2017/07/all-this-eternalpetya-stuff-makes-me-wannacry/)\nransomware that used an SMB exploit as an attack vector. Attribution to North Korea rested\nlargely on code reuse between WannaCry and previous North Korean attacks, but this was\nconsidered to be thin grounds given the common practice of tool sharing between regional\nthreat groups. Western intelligence agencies released official statements to the public\nreaffirming the attribution, and on September 6, 2018, the US Department of Justice charged\na North Korean national with involvement in both WannaCry and the Sony breach.\n\nMore recently, the financially-motivated arm of Lazarus Group has been garnering attention\nfor attacks against financial institutions, as well as cryptocurrency exchanges. The latter is\nnotable for involving Trojanized trading apps for both Windows and MacOS.\n\n## Malware commonly deployed\n\n[DarkSeoul](https://www.secureworks.com/research/wiper-malware-analysis-attacking-korean-financial-sector)\n[Fallchill](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/trojan-variants/fallchill)\n[Trojan.Fastcash](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-275A)\n[Bitsran](https://baesystemsai.blogspot.com/2017/10/taiwan-heist-lazarus-tools.html)\nAssorted backdoors for persistence\n\n## Should you be worried?\n\nYes, but not to the degree you might think. Lazarus Group activities center on financial gain,\nas well as achieving the political goals of the North Korean regime. Given that North Korea’s\nstated political objectives tend to hyper focus on regional conflicts with South Korea and\nJapan, businesses outside of that sphere probably are at a low risk of politically-motivated\nattacks.\n\nFinancial motivations, however, do pose a significant risk to almost all organizations.\nFortunately, defense against these types of attacks is largely the same whether they are\nstate sponsored or not. Defenders should have robust log-monitoring capability, a patch\n\n\n-----\n\n[management program, anti-phishing protection, and flags to distinguish legitimate](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2019/02/business-anti-phishing/)\ncommunications from leadership from imposters.\n\n## What might they do next?\n\nAttribution for Lazarus attacks is softer than with many other threat groups, and divining\npolitical motivations for North Korea has proven difficult for decades. As a result, it’s tough to\nproject what their next targets might be. It’s a reasonable assumption, however, that while\nsanctions remain on North Korean leadership, the financial motivations of Lazarus will also\nremain. Organizations at particular risk of financially-motivated attacks should include\nLazarus while considering security mitigations.\n\n## Additional resources\n\n[Comprehensive review of TTPs by Kaspersky](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07180244/Lazarus_Under_The_Hood_PDF_final.pdf)\n\n[Extensive review of the Sony attack](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Report.pdf)\n\n[April 10th US-CERT report on North Korean trojan HOPLIGHT](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/AR19-100A)\n\n\n-----",
