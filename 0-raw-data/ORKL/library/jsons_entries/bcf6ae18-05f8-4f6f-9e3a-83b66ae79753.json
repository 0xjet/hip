One such area is the nation of](tel:+18666999689)**\n\n**Nigeria.**\n\n**When you think of Nigeria and cybercrime, the first thing that pops into your mind is�**\n\n**probably the familiar Nigerian “419” scams. Those enticing emails that promise huge**\n\n**sums of money while scamming victims out of ‘advance fees’ and personal data have**\n\n**become something of a punchline these days. Despite being well known, they still**\n\n**persist and often succeed, but in reality, these are just a minor percentage of the total**\n\n**cybercrime activity coming out of Nigeria.**\n\n**For years now there has been a more serious Nigeria-based cyberscam with a rotating**\n\n**cast of actors and groups. The goal of this cyberscam is primarily financial gain, with�**\n\n**disruption of business as a welcome side benefit. �The potential, however, exists for**\n\n**more severe actions, in terms of physical compromise or destruction of property, cargo**\n\n**and possibly even human life.**\n\n**[While this activity has received a decent amount of coverage in the past, Cylance’s](http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-piercing-hawkeye.pdf)**\n\n**Research Team decided to take a closer look.**\n\n\n**[ShareShare](javascript:void(0);)**\n\n\n**90**\n\n\n**18**\n\n\n**1**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cylance’s investigation concentrated on an ongoing campaign out of Nigeria, primarily**\n\n**targeting high-impact industries in India. In particular: manufacturing, shipping,**\n\n**freight/cargo logistics, and transportation companies were targeted.**\n\n**The immediate gain from these attacks for the cybercriminals is access to a wealth of**\n\n**financial data. By leveraging credential-stealing tools such as Pony and �Hawkeye, the**\n\n**attackers are able to gain access to personal and corporate email accounts as well as**\n\n**breaching corporate intranets and VPNs.**\n\n**But rather than simply stealing data wholesale and selling it online to the highest**\n\n**bidder, the attackers do something unusual: they manually read through the mail in the**\n\n**compromised email accounts, searching for further targets (both personal and**\n\n**corporate) which they can leverage to infiltrate other companies or siphon money from.�**\n\n**The level of detail to which the attackers are privy after accessing corporate email**\n\n**accounts is alarming. Sensitive data including employee records, banking transactions,**\n\n**vehicle or ocean vessel tracking info, and standard intellectual property were all**\n\n**targeted and exfiltrated by this group.�**\n\n**There have been multiple ‘waves’ observed in these attacks, primarily spanning from**\n\n**October 2015 to June 2016. With the Pony Loader 2.2 infrastructure in place, the**\n\n**attackers were able to begin the initial stages of attack. This was typically carried out**\n\n**via a standard spear-phish email to individuals in targeted companies. The messages**\n\n**all have invoice, cargo or shipment inquiry themes, and are sent from registered**\n\n**domains that look very similar to the domains of legitimate companies with whom the**\n\n**target companies typically do business.**\n\n**For example:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1: Phishing Email 1 - Bogus Cargo Inquiry (With Malicious Attachment)_**\n\n**_Figure 2: Phishing Email 2 - Bogus Account Details Confirmation �(With Malicious Attachment)_**\n\n**The spear-phish emails are weaponized with either .BZ or .ACE compressed**\n\n**executables (extracting to either .EXE or .SCR files). �**\n\n**Those attachments are Pony or Hawkeye trojans, which are then used to steal even**\n\n**more credentials and data from the targets. Once the cybercriminals have actual**\n\n**legitimate credentials to work with, they send further spear-phish emails to additional**\n\n**targets manually identified from the compromised accounts. �**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 3: Phishing Email 3 - Bogus Outstanding Invoice Confirmation �(With Malicious Attachment)_**\n\n**In some cases, Hawkeye and Pony are sent in the same email, as per the example in**\n\n**Figure 4, below:**\n\n**_Figure 4: Phishing Email 4 - Changi Airfreight Center Enquiry (Note Spelling Errors) - With Malicious_**\n\n**_Pony & Hawkeye Trojan Attachments_**\n\n##### Panels and Infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5: Pony 2.2 Control Panel - 1_**\n\n**Cylance's primary investigative focus with these campaigns has been the wave which**\n\n**started in early April 2016, and (as of this writing) is still ongoing in June 2016. In early**\n\n**April, the attackers set up their main infrastructure via Unlimited Web Hosting out of the**\n\n**UK. Multiple registered domains were immediately used to set up Pony Loader panels**\n\n**and host associated malware:**\n\n**Initial Registered Domains:**\n\n**cosmoships-gr(dot)com**\n\n**equinoxdsitribution(dot)com**\n\n**etaship-sg(dot)com**\n\n**fortressict-nl(dot)com**\n\n**friendshlp-chartering(dot)com**\n\n**iwenconsultinggroup(dot)com**\n\n\n-----\n\n**octagonainternational(dot)com**\n\n**pcchand(dot)com**\n\n**pruship-tw(dot)com**\n\n**seahorsegroup-in(dot)com**\n\n**toships(dot)net**\n\n**tosihps(dot)com**\n\n**toslhips(dot)com**\n\n**toslhps(dot)com**\n\n**vietexcurisons(dot)com**\n\n**alexbensonship(dot)com**\n\n**The longest running panels (now down as of 6/14/2016) were hosted on nqvoil-**\n\n**sg(dot)com, and pcchand(dot)com. Pony C2s were briefly active on friendship-�**\n\n**chartering(dot)com, toships(dot)net, and tosihps(dot)com. Both the Pony-hosting**\n\n**domains, and those not hosting Pony were observed sending out weaponized email**\n\n**messages, directing victims to one of the active Pony C2s:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 6: Pony 2.2 Control Panel - 2_**\n\n**_Figure 7: Pony 2.2 Control Panel - 3_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 8: Pony 2.2 Control Panel - 4_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 9: Pony 2.2 Control Panel - 5_**\n\n**Armed with ample sets of credentials, the attackers now have access to an enormous**\n\n**amount of sensitive information. This is perhaps the biggest takeaway of this post. Even**\n\n**if the attackers were only interested in the financial data, of which there is plenty, the�**\n\n**potential for financial and physical damage via leveraging other segments of acquired�**\n\n**data is alarming.**\n\n**Not only do the cybercriminals have access to critical financial data such as account�**\n\n**numbers, transaction IDs, bank routing numbers, SWIFT codes, IBAN codes, and so**\n\n**on, but in this case the attackers also have direct access to vehicle, shipping, and cargo**\n\n**logistics data. This data ranges from the routes and locations of delivery truck fleets, all�**\n\n**the way to routing and cargo of commercial and government marine vessels. Examples**\n\n**of financial and transportation data, gathered/ monitored by the attacker, are given�**\n\n**below:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 11: Confidential Data Monitored by the Attackers - 2�_**\n\n**_Figure 12: Confidential Data Monitored by the Attackers - 3�_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 13: Vehicle/ Tracking Cargo Info Monitored by the Attackers -1_**\n\n**_Figure 14: Vehicle / Cargo Tracking Info Monitored by the Attackers - 2_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 15: Vehicle/ Cargo Tracking Info Monitored by the Attackers - 3_**\n\n**_Figure 16: Monitored Vehicle/ Cargo Tracking Info - 4_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The attackers are utilizing Pony Loader 2.2 almost exclusively for these attacks. There**\n\n**are a few specific targets where Hawkeye and/or Zeus came into play, but most of the�**\n\n**focus and benefit comes from Pony. The Pony malware is purpose-built to harvest a�**\n\n**prescribed set of credentials and data from the victim’s machine. Pony 2.2 is capable of**\n\n**harvesting RDP, HTTP/HTTP, FTP, SFTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP as well as bitcoin**\n\n**(including Electrum and Multibit modules).**\n\n**The bitcoin theft modules are relatively new to Pony Loader. That is to say, the**\n\n**functionality related to theft of cryptocurrencies was introduced first in version 2.0 of�**\n\n**Pony Loader. The password stealing modules are (in standard Pony fashion) also**\n\n**specific to certain products.�**\n\n**Global Password Module List:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 17: Global Password Module List -1_**\n\n**_Figure 18: Global Password Module List - 2_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 19: Global Password Module List - 3_**\n\n**The RDP Capture module can be seen below, along with portions of the bitcoin**\n\n**processing modules:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 20: RDP Capture Module -1_**\n\n**Below, we see how credentials are constructed from the data submitted from infected**\n\n**clients:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 21: RDP Capture Module - 2_**\n\n**Pony Loader stores data in a local MySQL database. This functionality is outlined in**\n\n**database.php on the server hosting the Pony DB:**\n\n**_Figure 22: Pony Loader SQL Database_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**exposed (in the clear) in the server s config.php:�**\n\n**_Figure 23: MySQL Credentials - Exposed_**\n\n**Upon execution, Pony Loader will attempt to identify specific AV products running on�**\n\n**the victim's machine, for evasion purposes. In the analyzed examples, the binaries are**\n\n**looking to identify running instances of antivirus products from the following companies:**\n\n*** Bitdefender**\n\n*** Kaspersky**\n\n*** AVG**\n\n**Pony binaries (associated with these campaigns) do not stray from the natively built**\n\n**binaries generated by the Pony Builder, with one exception. Some of the binaries are**\n\n**encrypted with an off-the-shelf Crypter tool called DarkEyE Protector:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 24: DarkEyE Protector Logo_**\n\n**In one example we looked at, the license for DarkEyE Protector is bound to /**\n\n**associated with the email address lakashop25(at)gmail.com. (Visible as artifact**\n\n**embedded in the malware binary). That same email address is associated with the**\n\n**hosting of the Pony C2 domains.**\n\n**_Figure 25: Domain Hosting Purchase Showing Use of Email Address: lakashop(at)gmail.com_**\n\n**If we go back to some of the initial spear-phish campaigns, we can actually find one�**\n\n**where that same email account was used to send the infected message:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 26: Spear Phish Email Showing Same Email Address Used as Domain Purchaser_**\n\n##### Attribution\n\n**There are many aspects that point to Nigeria above and beyond the by-the-book**\n\n**modus operandi outlined in both this write-up and some of the past efforts previously**\n\n**referenced.**\n\n**We also observed that most of the logins to the various Pony admin panels were**\n\n**tagged as being in Nigeria:**\n\n**_Figure 27: Pony Admin Panel Showing Logins From Nigeria_**\n\n**We also see consistent reuse of user names and passwords that reference Nigerian**\n\n**culture. These accounts appear consistently among the compromised accounts as well**\n\n**within the actual administrative credentials to Pony admin panels.**\n\n**For example, one particular actor uses several variations of “waxxy” which is a**\n\n**reference to the popular Nigerian DJ known as DJ Waxxy.**\n\n**EX: waxxy3:waxxysomuch**\n\n**EX: waxxy3:vgwbnpcnra**\n\n**EX: waxxy3:louiss33**\n\n**We also see several recurring uses of “chukwuka123” and “chukwuka”. “chukwuka” is**\n\n**a reference to the popular Nigerian actress Chioma Chukwuka:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 28: Chioma Chukwuka, Whose Name is Often Used as a Password_**\n\n**The term “chukwuka” is more frequently used as the password to some of the Pony**\n\n**admin panels, but appears as a modified password for compromised accounts as well.�**\n\n**Going back to the specific attribution side, we can do a little more digging around these�**\n\n**terms to find OSINT pointing to specific individuals acting as part of this cybercrime�**\n\n**group.**\n\n**One particular username and associated email account pops up far more frequently**\n\n**than others. The “onyeb4real” user name is frequently observed setting up**\n\n**dummy/burner email accounts and using them to send out either weaponized**\n\n**messages, or text-only social engineering lures in attempts to lure victims into either**\n\n**running malicious code, or visiting sites hosting malicious code.**\n\n**Examples are listed below (exact URLs obfuscated):**\n\n**[h x x p s / / -onyeb4real@gmail.com:hope@www.maxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxookmark](mailto:onyeb4real@gmail.com:hope@www.maxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxookmark)**\n\n**[h x x p s / / -onyeb4real@yahoo.com:louiss33@www.xxxxxxxxxxxxxom/cart](mailto:onyeb4real@yahoo.com:louiss33@www.xxxxxxxxxxxxxom/cart)**\n\n**[h x x p s / / -onyeb4real@gmail.com:louiss33@dolxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxom/join/shipping](mailto:onyeb4real@gmail.com:louiss33@dolxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxom/join/shipping)**\n\n**[h x x p / / -onyeb4real@gmail com:louiss33@traclxxxxxx xxxx/signup/](mailto:onyeb4real@gmail.com:louiss33@traclxxxxxx.xxxx/signup/)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**p** **y** **g** **g**\n\n**[h x x p s / / -onyeb4real@gmail.com:Louiss33@wwxxxxxxxxxxxxxomount/login.jsp](mailto:onyeb4real@gmail.com:Louiss33@wwxxxxxxxxxxxxxomount/login.jsp)**\n\n**[h x x p / / -onyeb4real@gmail.com:louiss33@www.juxxxxxxxxxxxxxom959.html](mailto:onyeb4real@gmail.com:louiss33@www.juxxxxxxxxxxxxxom959.html)**\n\n**[h x x p s / / -onyeb4real@gmail.com:louiss33@wwxxxxxxxxxxxxxomm](mailto:onyeb4real@gmail.com:louiss33@wwxxxxxxxxxxxxxomm)**\n\n**[h x x p / / -onyeb4real@yahoo.com:louiss@wwxxxxxxxxxxxxxomos_.html](mailto:onyeb4real@yahoo.com:louiss@wwxxxxxxxxxxxxxomos_.html)**\n\n**[h x x p / / -onyeb4real@yahoo.com:louiss@baxxxxxxxxxxxxxomgnin/](mailto:onyeb4real@yahoo.com:louiss@baxxxxxxxxxxxxxomgnin/)**\n\n**[h x x p s / / -onyeb4real@gmail.com:louiss33@m.exxxxxxxxxxxxxomnin](mailto:onyeb4real@gmail.com:louiss33@m.exxxxxxxxxxxxxomnin)**\n\n**[h x x p s / / -onyeb4real@gmail.com:louiss33@signin.exxxxxxxxxxxxxomSAPI.dll](mailto:onyeb4real@gmail.com:louiss33@signin.exxxxxxxxxxxxxomSAPI.dll)**\n\n**[h x x p s / / -onyeb4real@yahoo.com:louiss@xxxxxxxxxxxxxomgin.php](mailto:onyeb4real@yahoo.com:louiss@xxxxxxxxxxxxxomgin.php)**\n\n**Oftentimes, the “onyeb4real” string is coupled with “louis33”. If we refer to the \"waxxy\"**\n\n**references outlined above, we see that there are also couplings of “louiss” (and**\n\n**variations of it) and both “onyeb4real” and \"waxxy\".**\n\n**A little OSINT digging reveals numerous profiles of a specific Nigerian individual names�**\n\n**“Louis” with a frequent handle of Waxxy or Waxxy3.

It is therefore critical that any protective or preventative controls on the**\n\n**hosts completely prevent that binary from being executed. Now that we see how much**\n\n**sensitive information a small group of cybercriminals can get access to using simple**\n\n**stolen email credentials, we can understand how vital it is to prevent this simple theft**\n\n**from happening. Unfortunately, that is not always possible with traditional, signature-**\n\n**based, technologies running on the endpoint.**\n\n**It is important to point out that some of the samples we analyzed were not ‘publically**\n\n\n-----\n\n**p p** **,** **g** **,** **g** **y** **y** **g** **y**\n\n**technologies and vendors rely on.
