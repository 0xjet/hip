    "plain_text": "# Sodinokibi/REvil Ransomware Defendant Extradited to United States and Arraigned in Texas\n\n**[justice.gov/opa/pr/sodinokibirevil-ransomware-defendant-extradited-united-states-and-arraigned-texas](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/sodinokibirevil-ransomware-defendant-extradited-united-states-and-arraigned-texas)**\n\nMarch 9, 2022\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\nOffice of Public Affairs\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nWednesday, March 9, 2022\n\nA man charged with conducting ransomware attacks against multiple victims, including the\nJuly 2021 attack against Kaseya, made his initial appearance and was arraigned today in the\nNorthern District of Texas.\n\nAccording to an August 2021 indictment, Yaroslav Vasinskyi, 22, accessed the internal\ncomputer networks of several victim companies and deployed Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware\nto encrypt the data on the computers of victim companies.\n\n“When last year I announced charges against members of the Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware\ngroup, I made clear that the Justice Department will spare no resource in identifying and\nbringing to justice transnational cybercriminals who target the American people,” said\nAttorney General Merrick B. Garland. “That is exactly what we have done. The United States,\nalongside our international partners, will continue to swiftly identify, locate, and apprehend\nalleged cybercriminals, capture their illicit profits, and bring them to justice.”\n\n“Just eight months after committing his alleged ransomware attack on Kaseya from overseas,\nthis defendant has arrived in a Dallas courtroom to face justice,” said Deputy Attorney\nGeneral Lisa O. Monaco. “When we are attacked, we will work with our partners here and\nabroad to go after cybercriminals, wherever they may be.”\n\nAccording to the indictment, Vasinskyi was allegedly responsible for the July 2, 2021,\nransomware attack against Kaseya. In the alleged attack against Kaseya, Vasinskyi caused the\ndeployment of malicious Sodinokibi/REvil code throughout a Kaseya product that caused the\nKaseya production functionality to deploy REvil ransomware to “endpoints” on Kaseya\ncustomer networks. After the remote access to Kaseya endpoints was established, the\nransomware was executed on those computers, which resulted in the encryption of data on\ncomputers of organizations around the world that used Kaseya software.\n\n\n-----\n\nThrough the deployment of Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware, the defendant allegedly left\nelectronic notes in the form of a text file on the victims’ computers. The notes included a web\naddress leading to an open-source privacy network known as Tor, as well as the link to a\npublicly accessible website address the victims could visit to recover their files. Upon visiting\neither website, victims were given a ransom demand and provided a virtual currency address\nto use to pay the ransom. If a victim paid the ransom, the defendant provided the decryption\nkey and the victim then was able to access their files. If a victim did not pay the ransom, the\ndefendant typically posted the victim’s stolen data or claimed they sold the stolen data to\nthird parties, and victims remained unable to access their files.\n\nVasinskyi is charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with\ncomputers, damage to protected computers, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If\nconvicted of all counts, he faces a total penalty of 115 years in prison. A federal district court\njudge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other\nstatutory factors.\n\nVasinskyi, a Ukrainian national with ties to a ransomware group linked to Russia-based\nactors, was taken into custody in Poland where he remained held by authorities pending\nproceedings in connection with his requested extradition to the United States, pursuant to\nthe extradition treaty between the United States and the Republic of Poland. Vasinskyi was\ntransported to Dallas by U.S. law enforcement authorities where he arrived on March 3. He\nmade his initial court appearance and was arraigned today in the Northern District of Texas.\n\nThe FBI’s Dallas and Jackson Field Offices are leading the investigation. Substantial\nassistance was provided by the Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs and the\nNational Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany H. Eggers for the Northern District of Texas and Senior\nCounsel Byron M. Jones of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property\nSection are prosecuting the case.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas, the FBI’s Dallas and Jackson\nField Offices and the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nconducted the operation in close cooperation with Europol and Eurojust, which were an\nintegral part of coordination. Investigators and prosecutors from several jurisdictions,\nincluding Romania's National Police and the Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime\nand Terrorism; Canada’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police; France’s Court of Paris and BL2C\n(anti-cybercrime unit police); the Dutch National Police; Poland’s National Prosecutor’s\nOffice, Border Guard, Internal Security Agency, and Ministry of Justice; and the\ngovernments of Norway and Australia provided valuable assistance.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the\nDepartment of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n(CISA); Germany’s Public Prosecutor’s Office Stuttgart and State Office of Criminal\n\n\n-----\n\nInvestigation of Baden-Wuerttemberg; Switzerland s Public Prosecutor s Office II of the\nCanton of Zürich and Cantonal Police Zürich; the National Police of Ukraine and the\nProsecutor General’s Office of Ukraine; the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency; the\nU.S. Secret Service; the Texas Department of Information Resources; BitDefender; McAfee;\nand Microsoft also provided significant assistance.\n\nFor more resources on ransomware prevention and response, visit\nwww.StopRansomware.gov.\n\n_An indictment is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until_\n_proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law._\n\n\n-----",
