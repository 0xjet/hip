The malware managed to sneak into Google Play\ndisguised as seemingly legitimate apps “Crypto Monitor”, a cryptocurrency price tracking app,\nand “StorySaver”, a third-party tool for downloading stories from Instagram.\n\nBesides delivering the promised functionalities, the malicious apps can display fake notifications\nand login forms seemingly coming from legitimate banking applications, harvest credentials\nentered into the fake forms, as well as intercept text messages to bypass SMS-based 2-factor\nauthentication.\n\nThe same trojan, only under a different disguise, was recently spotted on Google Play by\n[researchers at RiskIQ, who published their analysis of the threat in a November 9 report.](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/mobile-bankbot/)\n\n## The malicious apps\n\nThe first of the malicious apps we came across, “Crypto Monitor”, was uploaded to the store on\nNovember 25, 2017 under the developer name walltestudio. The other app, “StorySaver” with the\ndeveloper name kirillsamsonov45, appeared on Google Play on November 29.\n\nTogether, the apps had reached between 1000 and 5000 downloads at the time we reported them\nto Google on December 4. Both apps have since been removed from the store.\n\nFigure 1 – The malicious apps discovered on Google Play\n\nAfter the malicious apps are launched, they compare the apps installed on the compromised\ndevice against a list of targeted banking apps – in this case, the official apps of fourteen Polish\nbanks (the list of specific banking apps can be found at the end).\n\n\n-----\n\nIf any of the fourteen apps are found on the device, the malware can display fake login forms\nimitating those of the targeted legitimate apps. This may happen without any action on the user’s\nside, or after the user clicks on a fake notification displayed by the malware, seemingly on behalf\nof the bank.\n\nFigure 2 – Fake notification displayed by the malicious “StorySaver” app\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 – Left: Fake login form; Right: legitimate login form\n\nESET’s security systems detect the threat as Android/Spy.Banker.QL and prevent it from getting\ninstalled.\n\n\n-----\n\nESET telemetry shows that 96% of the detections come from Poland (the remaining 4% from\nAustria), apparently due to local social engineering campaigns propagating the malicious apps.\n\n## How to stay safe\n\nThe good news is that this particular banking malware doesn’t use any advanced tricks to ensure\nits persistence on affected devices. Therefore, if you’ve installed any of the above described\nmalicious apps, you can remove them by going to Settings > (General) > Application\n**manager/Apps, searching for either “StorySaver” or “Crypto Monitor” and uninstalling them.**\n\nThe bad news, however, is that if you have installed one of the apps on a device on which you\nuse any of the fourteen targeted banking apps listed below, the crooks might already have access\nto your bank account. We advise you to check your bank account for suspicious transactions and\nseriously consider changing pin codes.\n\nTo avoid falling prey to mobile malware in the future, make sure to always check app ratings and\nreviews, pay attention to what permissions you grant to apps, and use a reputable mobile security\nsolution to detect and block latest threats.\n\n### Targeted banking apps\n\n**App name** **Package name**\n\n[Alior Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.comarch.mobile) com.comarch.mobile\n\n[BZWBK24 mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.bzwbk.bzwbk24) pl.bzwbk.bzwbk24\n\n[Getin Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getingroup.mobilebanking) com.getingroup.mobilebanking\n\n[IKO](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.pkobp.iko) pl.pkobp.iko\n\n[Moje ING mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.ing.mojeing) pl.ing.mojeing\n\n[Bank Millennium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wit.android.bcpBankingApp.millenniumPL) wit.android.bcpBankingApp.millenniumPL\n\n[mBank PL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.mbank) pl.mbank\n\n[BusinessPro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.bph) pl.bph\n\n[Nest Bank](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.fmbank.smart) pl.fmbank.smart\n\n[Bank Pekao](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.eleader.mobilebanking.pekao) eu.eleader.mobilebanking.pekao\n\n[PekaoBiznes24](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.eleader.mobilebanking.pekao.firm) eu.eleader.mobilebanking.pekao.firm\n\n[plusbank24](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.eleader.mobilebanking.invest) eu.eleader.mobilebanking.invest\n\n[Mobile Bank](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.eleader.mobilebanking.raiffeisen) eu.eleader.mobilebanking.raiffeisen\n\n[Citi Handlowy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.konylabs.cbplpat) com.konylabs.cbplpat\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4 – Icons of the targeted banking apps\n\n### IoCs\n\nPackage Name Hash Phishing\nserver\n\nin.crypto.monitor.coins 57A96D024E61F683020BE46173D74FAD4CF05806 nelis.at\n\ncom.app.storysavernew 757EA52DB39E9CDBF5E2E95485801E3E4B19020D sdljfkh1313.win\n\n**_Special thanks to Witold Precikowski for bringing one of the malicious apps to our_**\n**_attention._**\n\n11 Dec 2017 - 02:58PM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
