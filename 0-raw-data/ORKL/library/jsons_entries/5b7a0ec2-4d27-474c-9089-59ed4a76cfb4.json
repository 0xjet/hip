    "plain_text": "# How cryptomixers allow cybercriminals to clean their ransoms\n\n**intel471.com/blog/cryptomixers-ransomware**\n\nA thorough understanding of the operational underpinnings of these mixing services is key to\ncomprehending how criminals are launder ransoms.\n\nNov 15, 2021\n\nCryptocurrency is a cybercriminal’s best friend.\n\nActors all over the world have leveraged this technology’s increased anonymity to buy and\nsell illegal goods, services, stolen data, underground infrastructure and force victims to pay\nransom. While blockchain analysis enables researchers and law enforcement to glean\ninformation from illicit transactions, criminals have countered by adopting the use of\ncryptomixers to obscure their transactions and further complicate investigations. Intel 471\nhas observed actors in the cybercriminal underground relying on cryptomixing services to\nobfuscate the origin of their criminal earnings.\n\n**HOW MIXERS WORK**\n\nCryptomixers are often stand-alone services that are available to the general public via the\nopen internet. They often use anonymous means of communication and do not keep logs of\ncustomer transactions, which given the push by law enforcement for crypto exchanges to\nincorporate financial compliance laws into their operations, makes cryptomixers a useful tool\nfor criminals.\n\nMixers work by allowing threat actors to send a sum of cryptocurrency, usually bitcoin, to a\nwallet address the mixing service operator owns. This sum joins a pool of the service\nprovider’s own bitcoins, as well as other cybercriminals using the service. The initial threat\nactor’s cryptocurrency joins the back of the “chain” and the threat actor receives a unique\nreference number known as a “mixing code” for deposited funds. This code ensures the actor\ndoes not get back their own “dirty” funds that theoretically could be linked to their\noperations. The threat actor then receives the same sum of bitcoins from the mixer’s pool,\nmuddled using the service’s proprietary algorithm, minus a service fee. For added anonymity,\nthe threat actor can choose to send this new “clean” sum of bitcoins to numerous wallet\naddresses to further obfuscate the trail of the illicit funds. This makes it more difficult for law\nenforcement to associate the original “dirty” cryptocurrency with the threat actor.\n\nThe diagram below further explains how this scheme operates:\n\n\n-----\n\n**POPULAR CRYPTOMIXERS**\n\nWhile the act of “mixing” cryptocurrency is not itself an illegal practice, these platforms\naren’t widely used by the vast majority of crypto-enthusiasts. Most users do not need the\nextra level of privacy nor want to lose crypto to the service fees that come with mixing\ncryptocurrency. The cryptomixers that Intel 471 observed all had well-established presences\non multiple, well-known cybercrime forums. All of the mixers had professional-looking sites,\nlikely serving as an attempt to make their operations appear more legitimate and attract a\nwider range of clients. None of the providers advertised their roles in money laundering,\ninstead preferring to suggest their sites serve businesses using cryptocurrencies and\nindividuals interested in protecting their privacy.\n\nAmong the most popular mixers observed by Intel 471 are:\n\nAbsolutio\n\nAudiA6\n\nBlender\n\nMix-btc\n\nAll the mixers Intel 471 observed were operational on the clear web and Tor network except\nmix-btc, which was only available on the open internet. All four providers offered their\nservices in English, with Absolutio, AudiA6 and mix-btc also featuring Russian-language\nversions of their sites. All four mixers offered services for Bitcoin, while others also offered\nmixing services for Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Dash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin,\nMonero and Tether cryptocurrencies.\n\nAll the mixers listed a minimum balance for mixing services, which varied from 0.001 bitcoin\n(about US $60) for Blender to 0.006 bitcoin (about US $375) for mix-btc. Maximum\namounts varied significantly, with Absolutio limited to 2 bitcoins (about US $125,700), Audi\n\n\n-----\n\nA6 to 27 bitcoins (about US $1.7 million) and Blender to 2,600 bitcoins (about US $163\nmillion). Mix-btc did not specify an upper limit for transactions.\n\nAdditionally, all four mixers charge transaction fees, collected as a percentage of the total\namount of cryptocurrency to be mixed. Some services allow users to choose a “dynamic”\nservice fee, which is most likely done to complicate investigations into illicit cryptocurrency\nfunds by altering the amount being laundered at different stages of the process, making it\nmore difficult to tie the funds to a specific crime or individual. The fees are the following:\n\nAbsolutio:  Users select “dynamic” service fees, falls between 1 percent to 30 percent\n\nAudiA6: Flat service fee between 3 percent and 5.5 percent\n\nBlender: Users select “dynamic” service fee, falls between 0.6 and 2.5 percent\n\nMix-btc: Flat service fee between 3 percent and 5.5 percent, additional charges\ndepending on the volatility of bitcoin price\n\nWhile these mixers do not share their wallet addresses publicly, Intel 471 found a wallet that\nwas used by Blender from June 2020 to July 2020, handling bitcoin transactions in excess of\n54 bitcoins (about US $3.4 million). Assuming an average transaction fee of 1.6 percent, this\nwallet could have received fees in excess of US $50,000 during that time period.\n\n**EVEN MORE “PRIVACY”**\n\nWith RaaS groups wanting as many ways as possible to keep a low profile, some developers\ndecided to integrate cryptocurrency mixing services in their administrative panel instead of\nrelying on the web-based options. The developers behind Avaddon, DarkSide 2.0 (also\nknown as BlackMatter) and REvil likely integrated the BitMix cryptocurrency mixer to\nfacilitate the laundering of ransom payments for program affiliates. Additionally, BitMix\nitself operated an affiliate-type program in which registered partners received 50 percent of\nfees charged for mixing funds. This meant any RaaS groups engaged in this partnership\nwould receive 50 percent of the commission BitMix charged ransomware affiliates With\nBitMix commissions reaching as much as 4 percent, the affiliate program presents an\nappealing prospect to RaaS groups.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nCryptomixers are a linchpin in ransomware schemes. Through these services, threat actors\ncan achieve their end goal of cashing out and keeping the criminal underground liquid\nthrough the trade of illicit goods and services. A thorough understanding of the operational\nunderpinnings of these mixing services is key to comprehending how criminals are\nlaundering the money they earn from their crimes. It’s important to understand how all\nfacets of a ransomware operation works if civil society is to stop the losses inflicted by these\nschemes.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
