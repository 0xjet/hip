Since our last update, TAG has\nobserved a continuously growing number of threat actors using the war as a lure in phishing\nand malware campaigns. Government-backed actors from China, Iran, North Korea and\nRussia, as well as various unattributed groups, have used various Ukraine war-related\nthemes in an effort to get targets to open malicious emails or click malicious links.\n\nFinancially motivated and criminal actors are also using current events as a means for\ntargeting users. For example, one actor is impersonating military personnel to extort money\nfor rescuing relatives in Ukraine. TAG has also continued to observe multiple ransomware\nbrokers continuing to operate in a business as usual sense.\n\nAs always, we continue to publish details surrounding the actions we take against\n[coordinated influence operations in our quarterly TAG bulletin. We promptly identify and](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tag-bulletin-q1-2022/)\nremove any such content, but have not observed any significant shifts from the normal levels\nof activity that occur in the region.\n\nHere is a deeper look at the campaign activity TAG has observed over the past two weeks:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Curious Gorge, a group TAG attributes to China s PLA SSF, has conducted campaigns**\nagainst government and military organizations in Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, and\nMongolia. While this activity largely does not impact Google products, we remain engaged\nand are providing notifications to victim organizations.\n\nRecently observed IPs used in Curious Gorge campaigns:\n\n5.188.108[.]119\n91.216.190[.]58\n103.27.186[.]23\n114.249.31[.]171\n45.154.12[.]167\n\n**COLDRIVER, a Russian-based threat actor sometimes referred to as Calisto, has launched**\ncredential phishing campaigns, targeting several US based NGOs and think tanks, the\nmilitary of a Balkans country, and a Ukraine based defense contractor. However, for the first\ntime, TAG has observed COLDRIVER campaigns targeting the military of multiple Eastern\nEuropean countries, as well as a NATO Centre of Excellence. These campaigns were sent\nusing newly created Gmail accounts to non-Google accounts, so the success rate of these\ncampaigns is unknown. We have not observed any Gmail accounts successfully\ncompromised during these campaigns.\n\nRecently observed COLDRIVER credential phishing domains:\n\nprotect-link[.]online\ndrive-share[.]live\nprotection-office[.]live\nproton-viewer[.]com\n\n**Ghostwriter, a Belarusian threat actor, recently introduced a new capability into their**\ncredential phishing campaigns. In mid-March, a security researcher released a blog post\ndetailing a 'Browser in the Browser' phishing technique. While TAG has previously observed\nthis technique being used by multiple government-backed actors, the media picked up on\nthis blog post, publishing several stories highlighting this phishing capability.\n\nGhostwriter actors have quickly adopted this new technique, combining it with a previously\nobserved technique, hosting credential phishing landing pages on compromised sites. The\nnew technique, displayed below, draws a login page that appears to be on the passport.i.ua\ndomain, overtop of the page hosted on the compromised site. Once a user provides\ncredentials in the dialog, they are posted to an attacker controlled domain.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample of hosting credential phishing landing pages on compromised sites\n\nRecently observed Ghostwriter credential phishing domains:\n\nlogin-verification[.]top\nlogin-verify[.]top\nua-login[.]top\nsecure-ua[.]space\nsecure-ua[.]top\n\nThe team continues to work around the clock, focusing on the safety and security of our\nusers and the platforms that help them access and share important information. We’ll\ncontinue to take action, identify bad actors and share relevant information with others across\nindustry and governments, with the goal of bringing awareness to these issues, protecting\n\n\n-----\n\nusers and preventing future attacks. While we are actively monitoring activity related to\nUkraine and Russia, we continue to be just as vigilant in relation to other threat actors\nglobally, to ensure that they do not take advantage of everyone’s focus on this region.\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n[Threat Analysis Group](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/%20)\n\n\n-----",
