In this blog post, we analyze several of\nthose campaigns and their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). These campaigns\nwere all observed between mid-May and early July of this year, and can likely be attributed to\none, or possibly two, groups. The attacks have become more sophisticated, and have\nevolved to evade detection on a continual basis.\n\nOther researchers have attributed these attacks to a group known as the Cobalt Gang, which\n[has continued its activities even after the arrest of its alleged leader in Spain this year.](https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/mastermind-behind-eur-1-billion-cyber-bank-robbery-arrested-in-spain)\n\nSimple campaigns typically use a single technique and often embed the final executable\npayload into the exploit document. However, more complex campaigns require meticulous\nplanning on the part of the attacker and include more sophisticated techniques to hide the\n\n\n-----\n\npresence of the malicious code, evade operating system protection mechanisms and\neventually deliver the final payload, likely to be present only in the memory of the infected\ncomputer and not as a file on the disk.\n\nThe attacks we will be highlighting generally start with an email campaign, often targeted\ntoward financial institutions. The malicious emails display a strong command of the English\nlanguage, and their content may have been taken from legitimate emails relevant to the\nbusiness of the targeted organization.\n\nThe emails either contain a URL pointing to one of the three document types or have initial\nattack stages attached outright. They are using Word OLE compound documents with\nmalicious obfuscated VBA macro code, RTF documents containing Microsoft Office exploits\nor PDF documents that start the next attack stages to eventually deliver a Cobalt Strike\nbeacon binary or a JScript-based backdoor payload.\n\nIt is essential to be aware of these attacks as emails look legitimate, but can result in the\ninstallation of a payload that can inflict significant financial damage to the targeted\norganization.\n\n## Infection vector — Emails\n\nAll observed attacks start with an email message, containing either a malicious attachment\nor a URL which leads to the first stage of the attack.\n\nThe text of the emails is likely taken from legitimate email, such as mailing lists that targeted\norganisations may be subscribed to.\n\nBelow are three examples, with the first one purporting to be sent by the European Banking\nFederation and is using a newly registered domain for the spoofed sender email address.\nThe attachment is a malicious PDF file that entices the user to click on a URL to download\n[and open a weaponized RTF file containing exploits for CVE-2017-11882,](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11882) [CVE-2017-8570](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-8570)\n[and CVE-2018-8174. The final payload is a JScript backdoor also known as More_eggs that](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8174)\nallows the attacker to control the affected system remotely.\n\n\n-----\n\nObserved email campaign 1\n\nThe second campaign, sent on June 19, appears to be sharing threat intelligence information\nwith the recipient, and the sender seems to be from a newly registered domain that looks like\na domain belonging to a major manufacturer of ATMs and other payment systems. This\ncampaign contains a URL, which points to a malicious Word document where the infection\nchain is triggered by the user allowing the VBA macro code to run.\n\nObserved email campaign 2\n\nThe third campaign, sent on July 10, is a more personal campaign that targets a variety of\n\n\n-----\n\nbusinesses. The subject indicates that this is a complaint about problems with services\nprovided by the target company, allegedly listed in an attached document. The attachment is\nan RTF document containing exploits that start the chain of several infection stages until the\nfinal executable payload is downloaded and loaded in the memory of the infected system. All\nemails lead to stage 1 of the attack chain.\n\nObserved email campaign 3\n\n## Stage 1\n\n**Document attacks (PDFs, RTFs, DOCs)**\n\nMost commonly, the observed emails have a malicious RTF file as an attachment, but the\nattachments can also be Word documents with obfuscated VBA macro code, PDF files that\nredirect to other documents, or even outright binary executable payloads.\n\nHere, we show an example of a PDF campaign as seen from the point of view of the affected\nuser. The user receives an email with a PDF attachment and opens a file that does not\ncontain any exploit code, but relies on the social engineering techniques used in the email,\nwhich should convince the user to open the attachment without suspecting that there may be\nsomething wrong with it.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis malicious PDF only contains a URL to entice the user to view the file.\n\nIf the user chooses to click on the URL link and to read the actual content of the file, the\nbrowser will open a legitimate Google location which will redirect the browser to a malicious\ndocument.\n\nBrowser redirection\n\nFinally, the malicious Word document is opened and the VBA macro code is run after the\nuser allows for the editing of the content within Word. This eventually kickstarts the rest of\nthe infection chain, terminates the Word process to hide the original file and opens a new\n\n\n-----\n\nWord instance to display a non-malicious decoy document dropped to the disk drive by one\nof the previous stages.\n\nMalicious Word document\n\nThe decoy document remains constant throughout the campaign and is likely a side effect of\nthe Threadkit exploit toolkit and cannot be relied upon for attribution.\n\nDecoy document opened in Word\n\n\n-----\n\n**Stage 2 — Exploits and exploit kits**\n\nRTF documents sent in the observed campaigns contain exploits for several vulnerabilities in\nMicrosoft Office, and they seem to be created using a version of an exploit toolkit, often\nreferred to as [Threadkit. Documents generated by the toolkit typically launch a couple of](https://www.scmagazine.com/evolving-exploit-builder-kit-threadkit-used-for-rat-and-banking-trojan-campaigns/article/755975/)\nbatch files, task.bat and task (2).bat that drive the rest of the infection process.\n\nThreadkit is not exclusively used by the actors behind the observed attacks but also by other\ngroups utilizing various payloads, including Trickbot, Lokibot, SmokeLoader and some other\nbanking malware.\n\nThe actors behind the attacks seem to be using a somewhat modified version of the exploit\nkit, which relies on launching code through known mechanisms for evading Windows\nAppLocker protection feature and leveraging legitimate Microsoft applications such as cmstp,\nregsvr32 or msxsl. We will discuss these mechanisms in more detail later in this post.\n\nAt least three vulnerabilities are exploited with these documents, the most common of which\nis a memory stack buffer overflow in Microsoft Equation Editor (CVE-2017-11882) patched by\nMicrosoft in November 2017, followed by a composite moniker vulnerability (CVE-20178570), as well as the very similar, but slightly older, script moniker vulnerability that is very\npopular among attackers (CVE-2017-0199).\n\nMore recent attacks also attempted to exploit an Internet Explorer vulnerability (CVE-20188174) triggered by an RTF document and an embedded URL moniker object. The embedded\nobject triggers a download of an HTML page containing the VBScript that exploits the\nvulnerability and launches the shellcode. The HTML component of the exploit is based on\nthe [original exploit code discovered in May this year.](https://github.com/0x09AL/CVE-2018-8174-msf/blob/master/CVE-2018-8174.rb)\n\n\n-----\n\nCVE-2018-8174 VB script exploit code\n\n## Stage 3 — Scriptlets, scripts and DLLs\n\n**AppLocker bypass attempts (cmstp, msxsl, regsvr32)**\n\n[When Microsoft decided to add the AppLocker feature to Windows to allow defenders to](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-overview)\nimplement holistic protection application control, security researchers began working on the\noffensive side of security to search for ways to circumvent it.\n\nWindows AppLocker allows administrators to control which executable files are denied or\nauthorized to execute. Administrators can create rules based on file names, publishers or file\nlocation that will allow only certain files to execute, but not others.\n\nAppLocker works well for executables and over time it has also been improved to control\nvarious script types, including JScript, PowerShell and VBScript. This has significantly\nreduced the attack surface and forced attackers, including more sophisticated groups, to find\nnew methods of launching executable code.\n\nA number of legitimate Windows executables that are not blocked by the default AppLocker\npolicies has been discovered and various proof of concept AppLocker bypass code became\npublicly available.\n\n\n-----\n\nNotable applications used in these attacks are cmstp and msxsl. The Microsoft Connection\nManager Profile Installer (cmstp.exe) is a command-line program used to install Connection\nManager service profiles. Cmstp accepts an installation information file (INF) as a parameter\nand installs a service profile leveraged for remote access connections. A malicious INF file\ncan be supplied as a parameter to download and execute remote code.\n\nExample malicious INF file to load a remote SCT file\n\nCmstp may also be used to load and execute COM scriptlets (SCT files) from remote\nservers.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample of malicious scriptlet file used to drop a malicious DLL dropper for the next stage\n\nMicrosoft allows developers to create COM+ objects in script code stored in an XML\ndocument, a so-called scriptlet file. Although it is common to use JScript or VBScript, as they\nare available in Windows by default, a scriptlet can contain COM+ objects implemented in\nother languages, including Perl and Python, which would be fully functional if the respective\ninterpreters are installed.\n\nTo bypass AppLocker and launching script code within a scriptlet, the attacker includes the\nmalicious code within an XML script tag placed within the registration tag of the scriptlet file\nand calls cmstp with appropriate parameters. For example:\n\nHere, the attackers randomize the scriptlet name and use a .txt filename extension, likely in\nan attempt to bypass fundamental protection mechanisms that attempt to block file types\nbased on the filename extension.\n\n\n-----\n\nPayload dropper in an XSL file\n\nAnother executable used to attempt bypass of the AppLocker feature is msxsl.exe, a\nWindows utility used to run XSL (eXtensible Stylesheet Language) transformations.\nMsxsl.exe is dropped together with its parameter by the previous attack stage, a DLL\ndropper, and run to continue the infection chain.\n\nIt takes an XML and an XSL file as a parameter, but it also loads the script engine and runs\nthe script code within the <msxsl:script> tag of the supplied XSL file when invoked through a\ncall placed within the <xsl:value-of> tag.\n\nInvoking the JScript code of the payload dropper within an XSL file\n\nThe supplied XML file seems to be randomly generated and used simply because the\nsecond parameter is required and is of no further interest for analysis.\n\n**DLL dropper**\n\nAn earlier part of the second stage is implemented as an encrypted JScript scriptlet which\neventually drops a randomly named COM server DLL binary with a .txt filename extension,\nfor example, 9242.txt, in the user's home folder and registers the server using the\nregsvr32.exe utility.\n\nThe dropper contains an encrypted data blob that is decrypted and written to the disk. The\ndropper then launches the next stage of the attack by starting PowerShell, msxsl or\ncmstp.exe as described above.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the DLL dropper is finished with its activity, it will be deleted from the drive, which may\nbe one of the reasons why there are not too many DLL dropper samples available in public\nmalware repositories.\n\nExported functions of the two observed variations of the dropper DLLs\n\nFrom the observed samples, it seems that the attacker has access to the source code of two\nlegitimate DLLs which they modify to include the malicious dropper code. They can be\ndistinguished by looking at the names of the exported functions. The exported names seem\nlegitimate and should not be used as a basis for the malware detection.\n\n## Stage 4 — Downloaders\n\n**PowerShell leading to shellcode**\n\nThe PowerShell chain is launched from an obfuscated JScript scriptlet previously\ndownloaded from the command and control (C2) server and launched using cmstp.exe.\n\nFirst PowerShell stage with base64 encoded code\n\nThe first PowerShell stage is a simple downloader that downloads the next PowerShell stage\n\n\n-----\n\nand launches a child instance of powershell.exe using the downloaded, randomly named\nscript as the argument.\n\nPowerShell downloader\n\nThe downloaded PowerShell script code is obfuscated in several layers before the last layer\nis reached. The last layer loads shellcode into memory and creates a thread within the\nPowerShell interpreter process space.\n\nPowerShell stage shellcode loader\n\nThis PowerShell code used in the final stage to launch shellcode is publicly available as a\npart of an open-source antivirus evasion framework DKMC (Don't Kill My Cat) released in\n2016, but it is [also connected with the](http://www.offensiveops.io/tools/cobalt-strike-bypassing-windows-defender-with-obfuscation/) [Cobalt Strike framework.](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\nBeginning of the \"download and load\" shellcode\n\nThe shellcode is relatively simple and begins with a XOR loop that deobfuscates the rest of\nthe code. The most important function is the one that resolves the various API addresses\nusing a checksum of the API name as the parameter, traverses the PEB linked list of loaded\nmodules to find the required module, traverses the list of module exports to find the required\nAPI and finally jumps (calls) the found API function. The main purpose of the shellcode is to\ndownload an encrypted payload over HTTPS, decrypt it in memory and launch it.\n\n**JScript downloader**\n\nAs opposed to PowerShell loading a Cobalt Strike beacon, the other observed infection\nchain continues using JScript to deliver the final payload, which is a JScript backdoor. In this\ninfection chain, the DLL dropper drops a JScript downloader, which eventually downloads the\nJScript backdoor payload from the C2 server.\n\n\n-----\n\nJScript downloader which downloads and launches a randomly named backdoor\n\nThe final payload is another obfuscated scriptlet file that is started by launching regsvr32.exe\nwith the /U (unregister) command-line option to call into scrobj.dll JScript interpreter with the\ndownloaded scriptlet file as an argument.\n\n## Stage 5 — Payloads\n\n**JScript backdoor**\n\nIn the JScript side of the observed campaign's infection chain, the final payload is a fully\n\n\n-----\n\nfunctional JScript backdoor known as More_eggs, based on one of the variable names\npresent in its code.\n\nThe functionality of the backdoor is somewhat typical for that type of malware and allows the\nattacker to control the infected machine over an HTTPS-based C2 protocol. The backdoor\nhas its initial gate that it connects to on a regular basis to check for the next commands\nsubmitted by the attacker.\n\nThe commands are relatively limited, but are sufficient enough to instruct the backdoor to\ndownload and execute a new payload, remove itself from the system or download and\nlaunch additional scriptlets. During the research, we have not observed other binary\npayloads downloaded by the JScript backdoor but they are likely to be present in a real\nenvironment.\n\nLooking at our Umbrella Investigate telemetry, there was a low level of activity for most of the\nC2 servers. However, for one of them, api.outlook.kz, we observed a regular pattern of\nmoderate usage over the period of a few weeks with the majority of the queries coming from\nU.S., followed by Germany and Turkey.\n\nDNS queries for api.outlook.kz backdoor C2 host\n\nThe backdoor fingerprints the targeted system and sends back the acquired information,\nincluding an installed anti-malware program, a version of the installed operating system, the\nlocal IP address, the name of the infected computer, the username and other characteristics\nthat uniquely describe the infected system.\n\nTwo More_eggs backdoor versions, possibly two different groups?\n\nThere are definite similarities between these attacks — primarily in the type of exploit, but\nalso in the C2 infrastructure and the kind of payload that is used. However, that doesn't mean\nit can be attributed to a single actor.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are at least two different versions of the JScript backdoor used, version 2.0 and\nversion 4.4. Interestingly, if an attack used version 4.4, the attackers decided to add a\nvariable \"researchers\" initialized to the string \"We are not cobalt gang, stop associating us\nwith such skids!\", which may indicate that there is a more than one actor using very similar\nTTPs being active during the same period.\n\n**Cobalt Strike beacon**\n\nOn the PowerShell side of the infection chain, the downloaded final payload is a Cobalt\nStrike beacon, which provides the attacker with rich backdoor functionality.\n\nCobalt Strike beacons can be compared with Meterpreter, a part of the Metasploit\nframework. Cobalt Strike is used by penetration testers and offensive security researchers\nwhen delivering their services, but it is generally, just as Meterpreter, detected by antimalware software as it can be easily used by malicious actors.\n\nThe beacon payload allows attackers to maintain full control over the infected system and\npivot to other systems as they see required, harvest user credentials, execute code with a\nUAC bypass, escalate the beacon privileges using different mechanisms, and so on. An indepth analysis of a Cobalt Strike beacon payload is outside of the scope of this post.\n\n## Conclusion/Summary\n\n\n-----\n\nBreadth of the observed campaigns\n\nAttackers have to create a reliable and adaptable infrastructure to be able to continually\nlaunch attacks over an extended period of time. This sometimes requires the development of\nproprietary tools with the advantage of full control over them, but with a higher initial cost of\ninvestment.\n\nOn the other hand, attackers can choose off-the-shelf tools such as the ones described,\nwhich can serve their purposes equally well if they are disguised.\n\nWe have documented the activities of several related malware campaigns targeting users in\nthe financial industry, as well as other businesses, with a potential for financial return. We\nchoose to cover these campaigns to showcase the breadth of TTPs required for successful\n\n\n-----\n\ntargeted attacks, ranging from proper reconnaissance all the way to delivery of the final\npayload through several intermediate infection stages.\n\nThe TTPs we observed over the past two months are consistent with the previous activity of\nthe so-called Cobalt Group.\n\nHowever, we have found some payloads that contain a message for researchers stating that\nthe attackers are not the Cobalt group, which may indicate that the attacks are conducted by\ndifferent actors despite the commonalities in TTPs.\n\nAlthough the attacks are conducted using readily made tools, the attackers show a high level\nof technical knowledge judging by their ability to combine those tools into a number of\nsuccessful campaigns delivering different payloads to gain an initial foothold into their targets\nand provide attackers with a platform for further attack stages to reach their ultimate goal,\nwhich is likely a financial gain.\n\n## Coverage\n\nAdditional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection)\nmalware used by these threat actors.\n\n[Cisco Cloud Web Secuirty (CWS) orWeb Security Alliance (WSA) web-scanning prevents](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/cloud-web-security/index.html)\naccess to malicious websites and detects malware used in these attacks.\n\n[Email Security can block malicious emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security-appliance/index.html)\n\n[Network Security appliances such asNext-Generation Firewall (NGFW), Next-Generation](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/firewalls/index.html)\n[Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS), andMeraki MX can detect malicious activity](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/intrusion-prevention-system-ips/index.html)\nassociated with this threat.\n\n\n-----\n\n[AMP Threat Grid helps identify malicious binaries and builds protection into all Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/amp-threat-grid/index.html)\nSecurity products.\n\n[Umbrella, our secure internet gateway (SIG), blocks users from connecting to malicious](https://umbrella.cisco.com/)\ndomains, IPs, and URLs, whether users are on or off the corporate network.\n\nOpen Source Snort Subscriber Rule Set customers can stay up to date by downloading the\n[latest rule pack available for purchase on Snort.org.](https://www.snort.org/products)\n\n## IOCs\n\n**RTFs**\n\naf9ed7de1d9d9d38ee12ea2d3c62ab01a79c6f4b241c02110bac8a53ea9798b5\n\ne4081eb7f47d76c57bbbe36456eaa4108f488ead5022630ad9b383e84129ffa9\n\nbebd4cd9aece49fbe6e7024e239638004358ff87d02f9bd4328993409da9e17c\n\n7762bfb2c3251aea23fb0553dabb13db730a7e3fc95856d8b7a276000b9be1f5\n\na1f3388314c4abd7b1d3ad2aeb863c9c40a56bf438c7a2b71cbcff384d7e7ded\n\ndc448907dd8d46bad0e996e7d23dd35ebe04873bc4bb7a8d26feaa47d09d1eab\n\ncbbf2de2fbd4bce3f9a6c7c2a3efd97c729ec506c654ce89cd187d7051717289\n\n40f97cf37c136209a65d5582963a72352509eb802da7f1f5b4478a0d9e0817e8\n\n**DOC(x)s**\n\ne566db9e491fda7a5d28ffe9019be64b4d9bc75014bbe189a9dcb9d987856558\n\n9ddc22718945ac8e29748999d64594c368e20efefc4917d36fead8a9a8151366\n\n1247e1586a58b3be116d83c62397c9a16ccc8c943967e20d1d504b14a596157c\n\n**Dropper DLLs**\n\ncc2e9c6d8bce799829351bd25a64c9b332958038365195e054411b136be61a4f\n\n0fef1863af0d7da7ddcfd3727f8fa08d66cd2d9ab4d5300dd3c57e908144edb6\n\n74af98fb016bf3adb51f49dff0a88c27bf4437e625a0c7557215a618a7b469a1\n\n844f56b5005946ebc83133b885c89e74bc4985bc3606d3e7a342a6ca9fa1cc0e\n\n**Scriptlets**\n\n283f733d308fe325a0703af9857f59212e436f35fb6063a1b69877613936fc08\n\nafeabc34e3260f1a1c03988a3eac494cc403a88711c2391ea3381a500e424940\n\n3b73ebb834282ae3ffcaeb3c3384fd4a721d78fff5e7f1d5fd63a9c244d84c48\n\n4afba1aa6b58dc3754fe2ff20c0c23ce6371ba89094827fe83bb994329fa16a3\n\n**PDFs**\n\n\n-----\n\n5ac1612535b6981259cfac95efe84c5608cf51e3a49b9c1e00c5d374f90d10b2\n9d6fd7239e1baac696c001cabedfeb72cf0c26991831819c3124a0a726e8fe23\ndf18e997a2f755159f0753c4e69a45764f746657b782f6d3c878afb8befe2b69\n\n**Decoy document**\n\nf1004c0d6bf312ed8696c364d94bf6e63a907c80348ebf257ceae8ed5340536b\n\n**Executable payloads**\n\nf266070d4fe999eae02319cb42808ec0e0306125beda92f68e0b59b9f5bcac5a\n\nfc004992ad317eb97d977bd7139dbcc4f11c4447a26703d931df33e72fd96db3\n\n**URLs -
