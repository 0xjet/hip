It has quickly become one of the most\nprominent and profitable types of malware for Threat Actors (TAs).\n\nIn a typical scenario, the ransomware infection starts with the TA gaining access to the target device.\nDepending on the type of ransomware, it can infect the entire operating system or encrypts\nindividual files. The TAs will then typically demand payment from the victim for the decryption of their\nfiles.\n\nMultiple new ransomware groups have surfaced recently, highlighting the adoption of ransomware\nattacks by TAs for monetary gains. A few of them include:\n\n## RedAlert Ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\n[RedAlert or N13V is a new ransomware strain that targets both Windows and Linux VMWare ESXi](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-redalert-ransomware-targets-windows-linux-vmware-esxi-servers/)\nservers on corporate networks. The ransomware stops all running virtual machines and encrypts any\nfile related to virtual machines, such as virtual disks. RedAlert Ransomware was named after a\nstring with the same name in the ransom note, but threat actors named their campaign “N13V”.\nRedAlert only accepts ransom payments in Monero, which is rather atypical for ransomware groups.\n\nRedAlert ransomware has manual operations, which means TAs execute the ransomware after a\ncomplete takeover of the victim system. The ransomware binary provides various options to the TAs\nfor performing pre-encryption operations such as stopping all virtual machines running on VMware\nESXi, Asymmetric cryptography performance tests, etc.\n\nThe ransomware uses NTRUEncrypt public key encryption algorithm for encryption. The\nransomware only targets log files (.log), swap files(.vswp), virtual disks(.vmdk), snapshot files\n(.vmsn) and memory files(.vmem) of VMware ESXi virtual machines. After encryption the\nransomware appends a “.crypt[Random number]” extension to the file.\n\nThe figure below shows the leak site of RedAlert ransomware.\n\nFigure 1 – RedAlert Ransomware Leak Site\n\n## 0mega Ransomware\n\nAnother new ransomware gang, “0mega,” is suspected of targeting organizations using Double\nExtortion techniques. The indicators of compromise of this ransomware strain are unavailable in the\nwild.\n\nStill, as per researchers’ comments, the ransomware appends the files with the “.0mega” extension\nand creates ransom notes named “DECRYPT-FILES.txt.”\n\nThe figure below shows the 0mega Ransomware data leak site.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 – 0mega Ransomware Leak Site\n\n## Lilith Ransomware\n\nRansomware operators now have another new tool at their disposal, named Lilith Ransomware. This\nthreat can affect many file types and render them completely unusable.\n\nLilith ransomware encrypts files on the victim’s machine and appends the extension of encrypted\nfiles as “.lilith.” Afterward, a ransom note is created on the system to demand payment.\n\nIn this report, Cyble Research Labs conducts a deep analysis of Lilith ransomware to understand its\nbehavior and infection mechanism.\n\n### Technical Analysis: Lilith Ransomware\n\nStatic analysis indicates that the Lilith ransomware file is a console-based x64 architecture\nexecutable written in C/C++, as shown below.\n\nFigure 3 – Static information of LILITH Ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon execution, Lilith ransomware initially searches for a list of hardcoded processes in the file and\nterminates its execution if any of them are running on the target’s machine. This step ensures that\nthese processes do not block access to the files to be encrypted.\n\nThe below figure shows the APIs used to kill the process execution by the ransomware.\n\nFigure 4 – APIs used to Terminate Process Execution\nA full list of hardcoded process names is shown in the below figure.\n\nFigure 5 – List of\n\nProcesses for Termination\nTo identify the services running in the machine, the ransomware first calls “OpenSCManagerA()”\nAPI, which establishes a connection to the service control manager that gives the TAs access to the\nservice control manager database.\n\nUpon gaining access to this database, the following APIs() will be called:\n\n_OpenServiceA() – Opens the specified service._\n_QueryServiceStatusEx() – Gets the status of the service._\n\n\n-----\n\n_EnumDependentServiceA() – Retrieves the dependent services._\n_ControlService() – takes control of the service for stopping._\n\nIf the “OpenSCManagerA()” API fails to get the handle to Service Control Manager (SCM), then the\nransomware skips calling the below service-related APIs.\n\nFigure 6 – Service-Related APIs\nAfter that, the ransomware enumerates and gets the system drive information of the victim’s\nmachine by using the below APIs such as GetDriveTypeW(), FindFirstVolumeW(), and\n_FindNextVolumeW()._\n\nFigure 7 – System Drive Related APIs\nBefore initiating the encryption process, the ransomware drops the ransom note in multiple folders\nwith the file name “Restore_Your_Files.txt.” The ransomware creates a ransom note with the content\nshown in the figure below.\n\nFigure 8 – Malware Writes Ransom Notes\nThe ransomware searches for files to encrypt on the local system by enumerating the file directories\nusing FindFirstFileW() and FindNextFileW() API functions. It ignores the file extensions such as\nEXE, DLL, and SYS and excludes a list of directory and file names from the encryption process\n(Figure 9).\n\nInterestingly, the exclusion list contains the filename “ecdh_pub_k.bin,” which stores the local public\nkey of BABUK ransomware for file decryption.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9 –\n\nExclusion List of Folder and File names\nThe malware uses cryptographic APIs such as CryptAcquireContextW() and CryptGenRandom()\nfrom ADVAPI32.dll to encrypt victims’ files. The ransomware generates a random key with the\nfunction “CryptGenRandom()” and then encrypts the files using an encryption routine as shown\nbelow.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10 – Encryption Routine\nThe figure below shows the WriteFile operation and the original/infected file content before and after\nencryption.\n\nFigure 11 – WriteFile() Operation\nFinally, the malware renames the encrypted file with the “.lilith” extension and replaces it with the\noriginal file by using the “MoveFileExW()” API, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12 – MoveFileExW() API\nThe below figure shows the encrypted files by Lilith ransomware after the successful infection of a\nvictim’s machine.\n\nFigure 13 – Files Encrypted by Lilith Ransomware\nIn the dropped ransom note, victims are given three days to negotiate the price with the TAs for the\ndecryption software. At the end of this deadline, the TAs threaten to begin leaking personal data if\nthe ransom is not paid.\n\nThe ransom note also contains the poison ID for TOX communication and the Onion URL of the leak\nsite page – shown in the figure below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14 – Ransom Note\nThe figure below shows the Onion leak site home page of Lilith ransomware.\n\nFigure 15 – Onion Leak Site\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware groups continue to pose a severe threat to firms and individuals. Organizations need\nto stay ahead of the techniques used by TAs besides implementing the requisite security\nbest practices and security controls.\n\nRansomware victims are at risk of losing valuable data as a result of such attacks, resulting in\nfinancial loss and lost productivity. If the victim is unable or unwilling to pay the ransom, the TAs may\nleak or sell this data online, compromising sensitive user data for businesses and individuals and\nresulting in a loss of reputation for the affected organization(s).\n\nThroughout 2021 and 2022, we have observed record levels of ransomware activity. While notable\nexamples of this are rebrands of existing groups, newer groups like LILITH, RedAlert, and 0mega\nare also proving to be potent threats.\n\nCyble Research Labs continuously monitors new ransomware campaigns and will keep our readers\nupdated.\n\n## Our Recommendations\n\nWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against\nattackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:\n\n**Safety Measures Needed to Prevent Ransomware Attacks**\n\nConduct regular backup practices and keep those backups offline or in a separate network.\nTurn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected\ndevices wherever possible and pragmatic.\nUse a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected devices,\nincluding PC, laptop, and mobile.\nRefrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their authenticity.\n\n**Users Should Take the Following Steps After the Ransomware Attack**\n\nDetach infected devices on the same network.\nDisconnect external storage devices if connected.\nInspect system logs for suspicious events.\n\n**Impacts And Cruciality of Ransomware**\n\nLoss of Valuable data.\nLoss of the organization’s reputation and integrity.\nLoss of the organization’s sensitive business information.\nDisruption in organization operation.\nFinancial loss.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK® Techniques\n\n**Tactic** **Technique ID** **Technique Name**\n\n\n-----\n\nExecution [T1204](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/) User Execution\n\n\nDiscovery [T1012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012/)\n\n[T1082](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)\n\n[T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083)\n\n\nQuery Registry\n\nSystem Information Discovery\n\nFile and Directory Discovery\n\n\nDefense Evasion [T1027](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027) Obfuscated Files or Information\n\nImpact [T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/) Data Encrypted for Impact\n\n## Indicator Of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n**Indicators** **Indicator**\n\n**Type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\nLILITH\nRansomware\nx64 EXE file\n\nRedAlert\nRansomware\nLinux file\n(elf)\n\n\nb7a182db3ba75e737f75bda1bc76331a\ncf0fe28214ad4106c48ec5867327319eaa82b3c3\nf3caa040efb298878b99f883a898f76d92554e07a8958e90ff70e7ff3cfabdf5\n\nf2fa9a3ce883a7f5b43ba5c9ff7bdf75\nda6a7e9d39f6a9c802bbd1ce60909de2b6e2a2aa\n039e1765de1cdec65ad5e49266ab794f8e5642adb\n0bdeb78d8c0b77e8b34ae09\n\n\nMD5\nSHA1\nSha256\n\nMD5\nSHA1\nSha256\n\n\n-----",
