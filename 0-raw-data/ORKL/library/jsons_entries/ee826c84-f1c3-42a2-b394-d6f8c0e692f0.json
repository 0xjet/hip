Based\non widely publicized operations alone, the group has attempted to\nsteal more than $1.1 billion.\n\nInstead of simply obtaining accesses and moving to transfer funds\nas quickly as possible, APT38 is believed to operate more similarly\nto an espionage operation, carefully conducting reconnaissance\nwithin compromised financial institutions and balancing financially\nmotivated objectives with learning about internal systems.\n\nAPT38 shares malware code and other development resources with\nTEMP.Hermit North Korean cyber espionage activity, although we\nconsider APT38's operations more global and highly specialized for\ntargeting the financial sector.\n\nThe group has compromised more than 16 organizations in at least 11\ndifferent countries, sometimes simultaneously, since at least 2014.\n\nSince the first observed activity, the group's operations have\nbecome increasingly complex and destructive. APT38 has adopted\na calculated approach, allowing them to sharpen their tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) over time while evading\ndetection.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Table of Contents\n\n\n**Re-evaluation of North Korean State-Sponsored**\n**Activities.............................................................................................4**\n\n**Targeting and Mission...................................................................6**\n\nBank Targeting.......................................................................... 7\n\nOther Targeting........................................................................ 8\n\nRelationship to other North Korean\nState-Sponsored Activities..................................................9\n\nEffects of Sanctions...............................................................12\n\n**Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures.....................................14**\n\nEarly Activities and Operations Development............14\n\nScale of Operations................................................................15\n\nA Modern Bank Heist at a Glance.....................................16\n\n**Heist Stages & Operational Characteristics........................17**\n\n1 Information Gathering........................................................17\n\n2 Initial Compromise..............................................................18\n\n3 Internal Reconnaissance...................................................19\n\n4 Pivot to SWIFT Servers................................................... 20\n\n\n5 Transfer Funds......................................................................21\n\n6 Destroy Evidence...............................................................22\n\n**Malware.............................................................................................23**\n\nEvading Detection.................................................................24\n\nEvading Antivirus...................................................................25\n\nModular Malware....................................................................25\n\nUse of False Flags..................................................................25\n\n**Attribution........................................................................................26**\n\nNorth Korean Infrastructure...............................................26\n\nShared Resources, Motivation...........................................27\n\nLinks to North Korean Military Units .............................27\n\n**Outlook and Implications..........................................................28**\n\nTechnical Annex: Malware Used by APT38................. 29\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Re-evaluation of North Korean\n State-Sponsored Activities\n\nIn 2018, we began an intensive review of North Korean\nstate-sponsored cyber operations based on activity that\nwe had previously attributed to TEMP.Hermit, related data\nderived from Mandiant forensic investigations, FireEye\nappliances, FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence collections, and\npublic reporting associated with the \"Lazarus\" (aka\nHidden Cobra) group. Investigating intrusions of many\nvictimized organizations has provided us with a unique\nperspective into the entire attack lifecycle. As a result of\nthis review, we are separating a cluster of activity distinct\nenough to be tracked separately from TEMP.Hermit. We\nnow refer to this financially motivated group as APT38.\n\n\n-----\n\n- APT38 is a financially motivated group linked to North\n\nKorean cyber espionage operators, renown for attempting\nto steal hundreds of millions of dollars from financial\ninstitutions and their brazen use of destructive malware.\n\n- APT38 executes sophisticated bank heists typically\n\nfeaturing long planning, extended periods of access\nto compromised victim environments preceding any\nattempts to steal money, fluency across mixed operating\nsystem environments, the use of custom developed tools,\nand a constant effort to thwart investigations capped\nwith a willingness to completely destroy compromised\nmachines afterwards.\n\n- [A 2016 Novetta report detailed the work of security](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Report.pdf)\n\nvendors attempting to unveil tools and infrastructure\nrelated to the 2014 destructive attack against Sony\nPictures Entertainment. This report detailed malware\nand tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that the\nresearchers believed were linked to a set of developers and\noperators they dubbed \"Lazarus,\" a name that has become\nlargely synonymous with aggressive North Korean cyber\noperations. We tracked many of these indicators and\ncampaigns as TEMP.Hermit.\n\n\n\n- Attribution to both the \"Lazarus\" group and TEMP.Hermit\n\nwas made with varying levels of confidence primarily\nbased on similarities in malware being leveraged in\nidentified operations. Over time these malware similarities\ndiverged, as did targeting, intended outcomes, and TTPs,\nalmost certainly indicating that TEMP.Hermit activity is\nmade up of multiple operational groups primarily linked\ntogether with shared malware development resources and\nNorth Korean state sponsorship.\n\n- Because APT38 is backed by (and acts on behalf of) the\n\nNorth Korean regime, we opted to categorize the group as\nan \"APT\" instead of a \"FIN.\" This also reflects that APT38's\noperations closely resemble espionage-related activity.\n\n- We will continue to refer to TEMP.Hermit and related North\n\nKorea-sponsored activity as appropriate, minus the distinct\noperations we are now attributing to APT38.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Targeting and Mission\n\n\nBased on observed activity, we judge that APT38's\nprimary mission is targeting financial institutions and\nmanipulating inter-bank financial systems to raise large\nsums of money for the North Korean regime. Increasingly\nheavy and pointed international sanctions have been\nlevied on North Korea following the regime's continued\nweapons development and testing. The pace of APT38\nactivity probably reflects increasingly desperate efforts\nto steal funds to pursue state interests, despite growing\neconomic pressure on Pyongyang. Since 2015, APT38\nhas attempted to steal hundreds of millions of dollars\nfrom financial institutions. Some of the publicly reported\nattempted heists attributable to APT38 include:\n\n\n\n- [Vietnam TP Bank in December 2015](https://www.reuters.com/article/cyber-hesit-vietnam-idUSL3N18E1OF)\n\n- [Bangladesh Bank in February 2016](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/03/magazine/money-issue-bangladesh-billion-dollar-bank-heist.html)\n\n- [Far Eastern International Bank in Taiwan in October 2017](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-17/north-korean-hacker-group-linked-to-taiwanese-bank-cyberheist)\n\n- [Bancomext in January 2018](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-29/mexico-foiled-a-110-million-bank-heist-then-kept-it-a-secret)\n\n- [Banco de Chile in May 2018](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-banks-cyberattack/bank-of-chile-trading-down-after-hackers-rob-millions-in-cyberattack-idUSKBN1J72FC)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Bank Targeting\nAPT38 has pursued their main objective of targeting banks\nand financial entities since at least 2014[1]. In late 2015,\ntheir operations escalated as they attempted to conduct\nfraudulent transactions for the first time. Throughout 2016,\nAPT38 pursued geographically diverse targets at a notable\nrate. While APT38 is financially motivated, we believe\nthat in certain instances, they targeted entities solely for\ninfrastructure to facilitate follow-on operations or help\nevade detection.\n\nDuring our review, multiple public incidents have been\nreportedly linked to this body of activity based largely\non their targeting of SWIFT systems. We are currently\ntracking a variety of suspected events that have varying\ndegrees of associations to APT38. Although we cannot\nconfirm these instances were conducted by APT38, we\nhave observed some overlaps between these publicly\nreported events and APT38 based on the timing and\nlocation of targeting, malware, and general TTPs used.\n\n- [A recent criminal complaint, unsealed on Sept. 6, 2018,](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and)\n\nby the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) detailing links\nbetween APT38, additional TEMP.Hermit activity, and\nthe North Korean regime, named an African bank that\nappears to have been targeted in early 2016. The bank\nwas allegedly targeted with the NESTEGG backdoor\nand involved an attempted theft of approximately $100\nmillion. This compromise overlaps with APT38's use of\nNESTEGG and the general timing of APT38 operations\nin early 2016.\n\n\n\n- The DOJ complaint detailed a Southeast Asian bank\n\ntargeted in late 2015 and 2016. This coincides with\nAPT38's targeting of organizations in Southeast Asia,\nincluding entities located in Vietnam, Malaysia, and the\nPhilippines throughout 2016. The DOJ complaint also\ndetailed adversary use of a shared password between\nBangladesh Bank, the African bank and Southeast Asian\nbank, providing evidence of further TTP overlap with\nAPT38.\n\n- [Per public reporting, threat actors targeted Banco del](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-heist-swift-specialreport-idUSKCN0YB0DD)\n\nAustro in Ecuador with fraudulent SWIFT transactions\nin 2015. While we have limited insight into this targeting,\nwe have identified APT38 targeting South American\nentities previously.\n\n- In August 2018, threat actors targeted Cosmos\n\nBank in India using both fraudulent ATM and SWIFT\n[transactions. Public reports have indicated that](https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/cosmos-online-theft-after-7th-arrest-sit-probe-covers-other-states/story-PlWSvlCLT0161H6OHS5E8O.html)\nindividuals located in India were used to assist in\nwithdrawing fraudulent funds. While we have not\nobserved APT38 target ATMs, the use of individuals\n[in country to carry out attacks is similar to public](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-08-03/a-baccarat-binge-helped-launder-the-world-s-biggest-cyberheist)\n[reporting of APT38 leveraging individuals to launder](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-08-03/a-baccarat-binge-helped-launder-the-world-s-biggest-cyberheist)\nmoney after SWIFT attacks.\n\n\n1 The characterizations in this report are based upon our visibility and public reporting of activity. There are potentially additional banks and financial entities affected by APT38 that\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1. APT38 global targeting.**\n\n**POLAND**\n\n**UNITED STATES** **TURKEY**\n\n**MEXICO**\n\n**BRAZIL**\n\n**CHILE**\n\n**URUGUAY**\n\n**INDUSTRIES TARGETED**\n\nBanks/Credit Unions\n\nMedia\n\nFinancial Transaction\n\nGovernments\n\nFinancial Exchange\n\n###### Other Targeting\nAlthough the group's primary targets appear to be\nbanks and other financial organizations, they have also\ntargeted countries' financial governing bodies as well as\nmedia organizations with a focus on the financial sector.\nWe surmise that the targeting of banks, media, and\ngovernment agencies is conducted in support of APT38's\nprimary mission.\n\n- In late 2016, APT38 most likely deployed strategic web\n\ncompromises (watering holes) at cryptocurrencyfocused media organizations during the cryptocurrency\nbubble. These sites attracted significant traffic from\nfinancial institutions as they were seeking more\n\n\ninformation on different cryptocurrencies and initial coin\noffering. This incident was previously reported under\nTEMP.Hermit.\n\n- The group targeted news outlets known for their\n\nbusiness and financial sector reporting, probably in\nsupport of efforts to identify and compromise additional\nfinancial institutions. These incidents were previously\nreported under TEMP.Hermit.\n\n- APT38 also targeted financial transaction exchange\n\ncompanies likely because of their proximity to banks.\n\nFigure 1 displays a map of countries associated with\norganizations that we can confirm were targeted by APT38.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2. North Korean operator posting in an underground forum.**\n\n**looking for a silent doc exploit**\n\n**12-04-2015, 09:01 AM**\n\n**Contact**\n\n[closed@HF:]\n\n**campbelldavid793@gmail.com**\n\nPosts: 13\nThreads: 3\nReputation: 0\nBytes: 0\n\n###### Relationship to other North Korean State-Sponsored Activities\n\n\nWhile the DOJ complaint highlighted potential links\nbetween major incidents associated with the North\nKorean regime, we believe these links provide insight\nto the much larger cyber initiatives conducted by the\nregime and are not bound by motivation or operation. The\ncomplaint details a complex web of social media accounts,\ninfrastructure, links to a North Korean government front\norganization, developers and operators associated with\ninitial reconnaissance of victim organizations, as well as\nmalware similarities observed between intrusions. These\nlinks provide support for the operations being carried out\nunder the direction of the North Korean government, as\nwell as giving insight into the scale and scope required to\ncarry out these large-scale operations.\n\n- The details provided in the DOJ allegations include\n\nspecifics about the email accounts and infrastructure\nthat were leveraged across multiple operations, such as:\n\n—— In December 2015, a North Korean\n\noperator associated with the email account\n(campbelldavid793@gmail.com) was observed\nposting in underground forums (as shown in Figure 2)\nasking for a \"silent doc exploit.\"\n\n—— This email account was later observed sending spear\nphishing emails to a U.S. defense contractor.\n\n—— The North Korean IP address that was used to access\n\nthe email account was also used to access another\naccount (wangchung01@gmail.com).\n\n\n—— This email account was associated with testing\n\ncontent in spear-phishing emails that was later\nobserved in spear-phishing emails sent to Bangladesh\nBank.\n\n- The DOJ complaint provided insight into overlaps in\n\noperator accounts used to conduct reconnaissance\nagainst a U.S. defense contractor, Sony Pictures\nEntertainment, and actors associated with their movie\n_The Interview, Bangladesh Bank, and other related_\norganizations. It stated that the operators conducted\nonline research on the targeted organizations and\nindividuals related to those organizations. The operator\naccounts purportedly sent out LinkedIn invitations to\nthe related individuals, and operators later sent spearphishing messages to many of these individuals.\n\n- The complaint also detailed similarities in malware\n\nobserved in targeting different organizations.\n\n—— Allegations against the subject of the complaint, Park\n\nJin Hyok, tie him to multiple campaigns, including the\nSWIFT fraud incidents we now attribute to APT38,\ntargeting of aerospace and defense contractors\nwe still attribute to TEMP.Hermit, and the release of\nWANNACRY ransomware.\n\n—— Specific technical details regarding some of these\n\noverlaps are outlined in the Malware section of this\nreport.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe assess with high confidence that the concurrent\ntargeting of multiple organizations in the entertainment,\ndefense, and financial industries would require a significant\namount of resources and multiple teams dedicated to\nachieving specific objectives.\n\n- The overlapping accounts used to research the affected\n\norganizations provides some indication that the same\nultimate sponsor ordered the reconnaissance activity of\nthe targeted organizations.\n\n- Most likely, the skillset of those conducting phishing and\n\npost-compromise operations are different and those\njob functions may also be separated. At one victim, for\nexample, there was a significant time gap between the\nobserved spear-phishing associated with operators\noutlined in the complaint and the observed activity\nassociated with the attempted heists, providing some\nindication that the spear-phishing was not necessarily\nconducted by the same actor attempting the heist.\n\n—— Given the lapse in time between the spear-phishing\n\nand the heist activity in the above example, we\nsuggest two separate but related groups under the\nNorth Korean regime were responsible for carrying\nout missions; one associated with reconnaissance\n(TEMP.Hermit or a related group) and another for the\nheists (APT38).\n\n—— Another potential explanation is that in many cases\n\nit was difficult to identify the original method of\ninfection at the affected financial institutions (APT38\nis adept in covering their tracks), making it difficult\nfor forensic analysts to trace operations back to the\noriginal source.\n\n- Similarities in malware observed at the victim\n\norganizations is a likely indication that the attackers had\naccess to either shared development resources or the\nsame code repository.\n\n\nConnections between APT38, TEMP.Hermit, and additional\nlinked incidents and organizations are notionally depicted\nin Figure 3 below. Park Jin Hyok's involvement as detailed\nin the DOJ complaint most likely indicates that he had a\nmalware and/or operational development role and that his\nwork was shared with multiple North Korean operations\nacross different motivations.\n\n- Park's connections to Lab 110, a cyber-focused North\n\nKorean military unit, and its front organizations were\nsummarized in the DOJ complaint. These ties are\ndetailed further in the section Links to North Korean\nMilitary Units.\n\n- Park's activities are linked to multiple incidents typically\n\ndescribed in public reporting as broadly linked to\n\"Lazarus,\" including WANNACRY and the targeting\nof the entertainment industry. Although malware\nsimilarities and common sponsorship link these incidents\nto Park, there is significant differentiation between\nAPT38 and these other related clusters of activity.\n\n- APT38, in particular, is strongly distinguishable because\n\nof its specific focus on financial institutions and\noperations that attempt to use SWIFT fraud to steal\nmillions of dollars at a time. Despite toolset overlap,\nthis is significantly different from TEMP.Hermit's more\ntraditional espionage-driven activity and distinct from\nother operations publicly lumped together as \"Lazarus.\"\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3. Notional depiction of APT38's connections to other North Korean state-sponsored operations**\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can confirm that the APT38 operator activity is\nlinked to the North Korean regime, but maintains a set of\ncommon characteristics, including motivation, malware,\ntargeting, and TTPs that set it apart from other statesponsored operations.\n\n- APT38's operations, malware, and motivations are\n\ndistinct from TEMP.Hermit.\n\n—— As previously mentioned, we assess with high\n\nconfidence that APT38's mission is focused on\ntargeting financial institutions and financial systems\nto raise money for the North Korean regime. In\ncontrast, TEMP.Hermit is a cluster of North Koreansponsored cyber espionage activity that has primarily\ntargeted defense and government entities; we believe\nits mission is to collect strategic intelligence against\ncountries that would benefit North Korean interests\nand dissident activity deemed a threat to the regime.\nTEMP.Hermit's scope is broader in general as well,\nalso targeting energy research in 2015 and electrical\nutilities in 2017.\n\n—— Since at least the beginning of 2014, APT38\n\noperations have focused almost exclusively on\ndeveloping and conducting financially motivated\ncampaigns targeting international entities, whereas\nTEMP.Hermit is generally linked to operations focused\non South Korea and the United States. For example,\nTEMP.Hermit's July 2017 targeting of U.S. aerospace\ndefense contractors was likely a result of political\nconflicts concerning North Korea's missile program\nand South Korea's missile-defense plans.\n\n- Public reporting typically reports the financially\n\nmotivated activities associated with the heists as a\nsubgroup of Lazarus, such as \"Bluenoroff\" by Kaspersky\nand \"Stardust Chollima\" by CrowdStrike.\n\n- Further, APT38's toolset is significantly more\n\nspecialized. Malware such as DYEPACK (a suite of\ntools that manipulates local data from SWIFT servers)\nis specifically designed to consider the intricacies and\ncomplex nature of banking transaction systems, such as\nSWIFT.\n\nIt is important to note that not all financially motivated\nNorth Korean activity is attributable to APT38.\n\n- While the broader TEMP.Hermit group has been\n\nobserved targeting other financial-related organizations\nassociated with cryptocurrency, our data did not\n\n\ndemonstrate these incidents had infrastructure, malware,\ntargeting, or timing overlap with other APT38-attributed\noperations.\n\n- APT37 (Reaper), another North Korean state-sponsored\n\ngroup, targeted a Middle Eastern financial company, but\nthere was no evidence of financial fraud.\n\n—— This organization was likely targeted by APT37\n\nbecause it pulled operations out of North Korea.\n\n—— There are no apparent overlaps between APT37\n\nand APT38's infrastructure and focus on targeting\nfinancial organizations. Although APT37 has\npreviously targeted the financial sector, it does not\nfocus specifically on stealing money as APT38 does.\n\n###### Effect of Sanctions\nWhile North Korean cyber operations against specific\ncountries may have been driven by diplomatic factors and\nperceived insults against Pyongyang, the application of\nincreasingly restrictive and numerous financial sanctions\nagainst North Korea probably contributed to the formation\nof APT38's core mission and operations.\n\n- APT38's operations began in February 2014 and were\n\nlikely influenced by financial sanctions enacted in March\n2013 that blocked bulk cash transfers and restricted\nNorth Korea's access to international banking systems.\n\n- Sanctions enacted in 2016 in March and November\n\nbroadened limitations and further curtailed North\nKorea's access to both funds and the international\nfinancial system by terminating joint ventures and\nprohibiting states from opening new bank branches in\nNorth Korea. Multiple rounds of sanctions in a single\nyear likely increased pressure for North Korea to come\nup with funds quickly as evinced by their attempted\nheist in February 2016 only two months after a foiled\nattempt in December 2015. Despite being engaged\nin multiple active compromises in January 2016, new\nsanctions may have contributed to APT38's escalation in\ntargeting via watering hole attacks in October 2016.\n\n- Multiple sanctions were enacted again in 2017, and they\n\nmay have continued to influence the speed of APT38's\nattempted heists with sanctions occurring in September\nand December 2017, and attempted heists taking place\nthe following month in October 2017 and January 2018,\nrespectively.\n\nA detailed listing of these and other significant events\nsurrounding the major attempted heists by APT38 is\noutlined in Figure 4 below.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APT38 TIMELINE\n\n\n**Figure 4.**\nAPT38 operations\nand North Korea's\nworsening financial\nsituation\n\n\nResolutions\n\nSummits\n\nGeneral operations by APT38\n\nTests by North Korea\n\nHeists or Attempted Heists by APT38\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Tactics, Techniques and Procedures\n\n###### Early Activities and Operations Development • Details published by DOJ indicate that malware\nEarly APT38 operations suggest that the group developers read user manuals for SWIFT systems,\nbegan targeting financial institutions with an intent to providing some indication of initial efforts to develop\nmanipulate financial transaction systems at least as SWIFT-specific malware, such as DYEPACK. The\nearly as February 2014, although we did not observe earlier observed deployment of DYEPACK was in\nfraudulent transactions until 2015. These activities December 2015.\nprovide some indication of a learning period that would\n\nBased on observed incidents, we believe APT38\n\ninform the development of TTPs later definitive of\n\nactivities were initially clustered in Southeast Asia as the\n\nAPT38 activity.\n\ngroup built up its capabilities before expanding globally\n\n      - We do not have evidence that the earliest targeted shortly after.\n\nfinancial institutions were victimized by fraudulent\n\n                                                    - Targeting in Southeast Asia likely spanned from\n\ntransactions before APT38 left the compromised\n\nFebruary 2014 to late 2017.\n\nenvironments, possibly indicating that APT38 was\nconducting reconnaissance-only activity at that time.      - Expansion into other regions, such as Latin America\n\nand Africa, began in early to mid-2016. Latin American\n\n      - Initial operations targeted Southeast Asian financial\n\norganizations have continued to be targeted into at\n\ninstitutions most likely because North Korea had\n\nleast May 2018.\n\nbetter access to money laundering network in these\ncountries.      - APT38 operations extended to Europe and North\n\nAmerica from approximately October 2016 to October\n\n      - In early 2014, the group deployed NESTEGG (a\n\n2017.\n\nbackdoor) and KEYLIME (a keylogger) malware\ndesigned to impact financial institution-specific\nsystems at a Southeast Asian bank. There is no\nevidence that these tools were used to target SWIFT\nsystems at the time, even though the victimized bank\nused SWIFT. These factors most likely indicate that\nAPT38 was still learning about various systems related\nto financial transactions.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Scale of Operations\nBased on the frequency and number of concurrent active\noperations, we have some indication that APT38 is a\nlarge operation with significant resources at its disposal.\nFurthermore, APT38 appears to have access to shared\nresources linked to TEMP.Hermit, most likely greatly\nincreasing the number of personnel available to the group\nand the pace of malware development.\n\n      - From November 2015 through the end of 2016, APT38\n\nwas involved in at least nine separate compromises\nagainst banks. This is a large number of compromises\nfor one group to conduct concurrently. The total\nnumber of concurrent compromises is likely to be even\nhigher than this, especially when factoring in targeting\noutside of the financial industry as well as suspected\nAPT38 activity detailed in the targeting section above.\nIn addition, many of the operations were at different\nstages of the attack lifecycle throughout this time,\nadding to the complexity and effort required to manage\nall the operations simultaneously.\n\n      - The group conducted extremely thorough and time-\n\nconsuming reconnaissance activities, demonstrating that\nit had both large numbers of personnel and the time to\ndedicate to lengthy operations. For example, in multiple\ninstances, APT38 dedicated time to observing network\nactivity and gathering critical information about users\nand systems that had access to SWIFT servers.\n\n      - APT38 maintained a large library of unique non-public\n\nbackdoors and other utilities, detailed in the Malware\nsection below. Additionally, APT38 continued to refine\ntools over time to incorporate additional tactics,\nincluding measures to evade detection. For example,\nthreat actors modified DYEPACK to avoid writing the\nmalware to disk by modifying the original stand-alone\nversion to be used in memory inline.\n\n      - In addition to cyber operations, public reporting has\n\ndetailed recruitment and cooperation of individuals\nlocated in-country to support with the tail end of\nAPT38's thefts, including persons responsible for\nlaundering funds and interacting with recipient banks of\nstolen funds. This adds to the complexity and necessary\ncoordination amongst multiple components supporting\nAPT38 operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### A Modern Bank Heist at a Glance\nAt a high level, APT38's targeting of financial organizations and subsequent heist attempts have followed the same\ngeneral pattern, as depicted in Figure 5 and explained below.\n\n**Figure 5.

The\n\nwhich employees have access to SWIFT\nsame account had a contact list with\n\nrelated systems.\n\nemail addresses for 37 employees of\nthe same targeted bank, suggesting a\nwider effort to establish connections and\npotential intrusion vectors.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the initial infection vectors at each\nattributed incident were not always\ndiscovered, APT38 relied on watering holes\nto gain initial access to at least some of the\norganizations. In at least one instance, APT38\nactors also exploited an insecure out-of-date\nversion of Apache Struts2 to execute code\non a targeted system. Further, the recent\nDOJ complaint provides insight into initial\ncompromise techniques conducted by North\nKorean operators against APT38 targets,\nwhich may have been leveraged as part of\nthe initial compromise into the targeted\norganizations.\n\n- A watering hole campaign hosted on the\n\nwebsite of a Polish financial governing\nbody (Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego, or\nKNF) was linked to multiple additional\nwatering holes in Latin America as well as a\ncryptocurrency news page. These strategic\nweb compromises are believed to have\nbeen used to infect multiple organizations,\nincluding some in Europe and North\nAmerica when victims visited the site.\n\n\nindicate that North Korean operators\nconducted a spear-phishing campaign\nagainst a specific bank using résuméthemed lure documents in early 2015.\nThis is corroborated by our identification\nof TEMP.Hermit's use of MACKTRUCK at\na bank, preceding the APT38 operation\ntargeting the bank's SWIFT systems in late\n2015. This activity is noteworthy and while\nwe acknowledge the operators detailed in\nthe complaint share resources and ultimate\nsponsorship with APT38, we do not have\nthe evidence at this time to attribute this\nspear-phishing activity to APT38.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Internal Reconnaissance\n\n**Characteristics:** —— In another case, we observed that\n\n## 3 • Deploy malware in a target environment APT38 compromised a SWIFT system\n\nto gather credentials and map the victim's and waited almost two years before\nnetwork topology. conducting fraudulent transactions.\n\nDuring that two-year period, APT38\n\n                  - Use internal tools, such as Sysmon and the\n\nmaintained access to the environment,\n\nnet.exe Windows command-line tool, to\n\ninstalled and updated backdoors, and\n\nscan systems.\n\nmonitored activity to learn more about\n\n**Operational specifics:** individual users, administrators, and\n\nAPT38 operators put significant effort into SWIFT systems.\nunderstanding their environments and —— It is possible that additional SWIFT\nensuring successful deployment of tools interactions occurred that were not\nagainst targeted systems.

APT38\ndeployed Sysmon on SWIFT systems to\nunderstand the processes, services, and\nusers that use SWIFT at each organization.\n\n                  - [APT38 installed MAPMAKER, a port](https://intelligence.fireeye.com/reports/18-00002554)\n\nmonitoring tool, on SWIFT systems.\nMAPMAKER is a reconnaissance tool\nthat enumerates and prints active TCP\nconnections on the local system. APT38 has\nused Sysmon and MAPMAKER together\nto gain a better understanding of the\nconfiguration and use of SWIFT systems\nwithin victim environments.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 5\n\n\n###### Transfer Funds\n\n\n**Characteristics:**\n\n- Deploy and execute malware that allows APT38 to insert\n\nfraudulent SWIFT transactions and alter transaction\nhistory\n\n- Transfer funds to accounts set up in other banks, usually\n\nlocated in separate countries where little oversight\nenables money laundering.\n\n- Typically, multiple transactions are initiated.\n\n**Operational specifics:**\n\nAPT38 relies on DYEPACK, a SWIFT transaction-hijacking\nframework, to initiate transactions, steal money, and hide\nany evidence of the fraudulent transactions from the\nvictimized bank. The group uses DYEPACK to manipulate\nthe SWIFT transaction records and hide evidence of the\nmalicious transactions, so bank personnel are none the\nwiser when they review recent transactions.\n\n- SQL statements identified at multiple victims deleting\n\nfraudulent SWIFT messages provide some evidence of\nhow DYEPACK modifies transaction records.\n\n- If the DYEPACK processor manipulates a record of a\n\nSWIFT message destined for a file or printer, it also\nmodifies the raw record in the Alliance Access Oracle\nSQL database. It does this using a series of steps:\n\n—— First, it serializes the data extracted from the print job\n\ninto an appropriate format.\n\n—— It then invokes a legitimate Oracle command-line\n\nSQL utility to update the database. These updates\nmay delete rows containing local records of SWIFT\nmessages or update the body text of a local record of\na SWIFT message. (Figure 6 shows an example SQL\nstatement used to query for SWIFT records.)\n\n—— When an employee goes to review the local records\n\nof the SWIFT messages, they will see the falsified\ndata planted by the attacker using DYEPACK.\n\n\n—— Because these techniques manipulate the SQL\n\ndatabase directly, the transaction data is changed\noutside of the SWIFT framework.\n\n- APT38 modified their malware to better suit the\n\nspecifics of how SWIFT was used in at least one\nvictimized organization, indicating the group has access\nto custom development capabilities. The targeted victim\nuses Foxit PDF Reader, a legitimate program, to review\nSWIFT message records as opposed to relying on\nprinted paper copies. To accommodate for this, APT38\nupdated DYEPACK to modify PDF files opened with\nFoxit PDF Reader to remove traces of the fraudulent\ntransactions. We refer to this variant of DYEPACK as\nDYEPACK.FOX.\n\n- APT38 transferred funds to banks in a separate country,\n\nmost likely to facilitate money laundering activity.\nPublic information reports that fictitious names and\nfraudulently opened accounts are used to quickly\ntransfer the funds to additional accounts, often under\nthe guise of government account payments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), foundations, and\nsimilar organizations.\n\n[—— According to public reporting, funds stolen from](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-08-03/a-baccarat-binge-helped-launder-the-world-s-biggest-cyberheist))\n\nBangladesh Bank were sent to four bank accounts\nin the Philippines and one account associated\nwith an NGO in Sri Lanka via multiple transactions.\nFurther reporting indicates that two individuals were\nassociated with allegedly laundering tens of millions\nof dollars in an illegal gambling operation. During\nthis heist, APT38 waited for a holiday weekend in\nthe respective countries to increase the likelihood of\nhiding the transactions from banking authorities.\n\n—— The use of an NGO for transferring money was also\n\nmirrored in a separate operation, where APT38\nattempted to transfer multiple transactions totaling\nmore than $100 million to a South Korean bank\naccount for a South Korean NGO.\n\n```\nselect * from saaowner.appe_<date> where appe_s_umid = '<id>';\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n## 6\n\n\n###### Destroy Evidence\n\n\n**Characteristics:**\n\n- Securely delete logs and files using non-public malware.\n\n- Deploy and execute disk-wiping malware to cover tracks\n\nand disrupt later forensic analysis.\n\n- Use publicly available ransomware on the organization's\n\nsystems to delay SWIFT investigations and destroy\nremaining evidence of activity.\n\n**Operational specifics:**\n\nAPT38 is unique in that it is not afraid to aggressively\ndestroy evidence or victim networks as part of their\noperations. The group, like many of the APT groups\nwe track, uses various methods to cover its tracks and\nmisdirect investigators. However, APT38 is also one of the\nmore brazen groups in that it is not afraid to cause enough\ndamage to render entire networks inoperable. This attitude\ntoward destruction is probably a result of the group trying\nto not only cover its tracks, but also to provide cover for\nmoney laundering operations.\n\n- Some functionality to remove traces of malware were\n\nbuilt into the malware itself. For example, DYEPACK\nincludes the ability to uninstall itself by removing its\nservice entry and calling a utility specifically used for\nsecure deletion. Once the file has been removed, it\nexecutes a Windows batch script to also remove the\nsecure deletion utility. In one instance, DYEPACK was\nconfigured to self-destruct on a preconfigured date.\n\n- APT38 deployed other tools (including CLEANTOAD\n\nand CLOSESHAVE) that were specifically designed to\nclean up other malware used during the operation. In\nmultiple intrusions, APT38 cleared Windows Event logs\nand Sysmon logs probably to thwart forensic analysis.\nIn early intrusions, this was done manually, but as the\ngroup's activities progressed, they developed and\ndeployed SCRUBBRUSH, a tool that deletes event logs\nand prefetch files, and may attempt to clean up master\nfile table (MFT) records.\n\n\n\n- APT38's operations demonstrate the group's intent to\n\ndisrupt victim operations. The group carefully identified\nall systems within an environment (along with the\ncredentials needed to access those systems) and then\npushed wiper malware to the selected systems before\ninitiating a massive wipe event. This is more calculated\nand time-consuming than relying on malware that\nuses self-replication to identify and wipe systems.\nFurther, BOOTWRECK (one of the wipers used by\nAPT38) was configured to destroy critical sections of\nthe victim machines and then initiate a system reboot,\ndemonstrating an intention to knock the majority of\nworkstations and servers offline. An example disk boot\nfailure screen observed at one affected Latin American\norganization is depicted in Figure 7.\n\n- APT38 has disrupted organizations' daily operations,\n\nincluding causing website outages, phone inaccessibility,\nand inoperability of important systems. During one\nreported incident, APT38 rendered close to 10,000\nworkstations and servers completely inoperable, causing\nan outage in the bank's telephone service and other\nessential services.\n\n**Figure 7. Example system knocked offline by APT38**\n(Source: Twitter)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Malware\n\nAPT38 has leveraged a large number of customized tools,\nalmost certainly indicating access to significant resources,\nincluding a large development team. Several tools unique\nto APT38 contain functions and code overlap with\nmalware used by TEMP.Hermit, almost certainly indicating\nthat these groups share a common developer.\n\n- As of this writing, we have attributed at least 26\n\nunique non-public malware families to APT38 and have\nobserved the group using at least two publicly available\nmalware families. This tool set includes a variety of\nbackdoors, disruptive tools, tunnelers, and data miners.\n\n- NESTEGG and MACKTRUCK share an identical\n\nhard-coded byte array, although this is not used in\nMACKTRUCK and appears to be an artifact from\ndevelopment.\n\n**Figure 8. APT38 attack lifecycle**\n\n\n\n- 260 bytes of functionality are shared between\n\nWANNACRY and WHITEOUT; the specific function\ngenerates a random selection of cipher suites for a\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) handshake.\n\nFigure 8 provides the breakdown of all the observed\nmalware families used by APT38, broken down by stages\nof the attack life cycle. The Technical Annex contains\nadditional details on each malware family.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Evading Detection\nAPT38 has employed multiple techniques for avoiding\ndetection, including use of passive and active backdoors,\nmodular malware, active testing, and agile response to\nAV. Additionally, APT38 regularly timestomps their files to\nblend in with other files in the victim environment\n\nBackdoors that are configured to operate in \"passive\"\nmode indicate that the attacker intends to access\nthe system with the backdoor from other internally\ncompromised systems. APT38 consistently leverages\n\"passive\" backdoors to provide ease of access to\nsegmented internal systems.\n\n**Figure 9. Active versus passive backdoors**\n\nCommand and\nControl Server\n\nCHEESETRAY\nActive Backdoor\n\n\n\n - The NESTEGG and CHEESETRAY backdoors have been\n\nidentified being used in passive mode.\n\n - At one victim, CHEESETRAY was configured to operate\n\nin passive mode on SWIFT servers, but in active mode\non SWIFT workstations.\n\n - Figure 9 contains an example of how APT38 used\n\na tunneler to relay commands from an active\nCHEESETRAY backdoor on a SWIFT workstation to a\npassive CHEESETRAY backdoor listening on port 8443\non a SWIFT Alliance application server.\n\nAPT38\n\nSWIFT Alliance\nApplication Server\n\nPublic Internet\n\nNACHOCHEESE\nPassive Tunneler\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Evading Antivirus\nAPT38 uses several measures to evade anti-virus and\nthwart investigator analysis, including the use of multiple\ncode packing methods and encrypting files on the system\nand in the registry.\n\n- Of the 26 unique custom malware families used by\n\nAPT38, at least nine malware families use a publicly\navailable method of code packing, such as Themida,\nEnigma, VMProtect, and Obsidium.\n\n- APT38 has demonstrated a quick response when its\n\nbackdoors are detected by anti-virus. In one victim\nnetwork, an anti-virus program began identifying the\nBLINDTOAD loader and subsequently detected it on the\nmultiple systems. In response, APT38 operators returned\nto the environment and installed new undetected\nversions of BLINDTOAD and CHEESETRAY.\n\n- In one instance, the group purposefully ran an anti-virus\n\nscan on a victim system, potentially to determine if its\nbackdoors were detected.\n\n###### Modular Malware\n\nSome tools used by APT38 are composed of multiple\ncomponents that load each other and are positioned\nin different places within a compromised environment.\nThe use of modular components is useful both in its\nextensibility, in that it's easy for the programmer to\nbuild out additional functionality in the future, and the\ndistribution of functionality among components assists in\nevading detection.\n\n- DYEPACK, for example, is comprised of separate\n\nprocessor, interceptor, and encrypted configuration\ncomponents.\n\n- BLINDTOAD, another APT38 tool, is a loader that\n\nprovides a framework to load an encrypted resource,\ndecode it in memory, and execute it. This typically\nbypasses traditional anti-virus detection.\n\n\n###### Use of False Flags\n\nAPT38 has incorporated several false flags during their\noperations to further mislead investigators, including:\n\n- In one case, APT38 dropped a variant of DARKCOMET\n\n(a publicly available backdoor) at the end of their\noperations. The configured command and control (C&C)\nserver for this sample was a legitimate bank in Africa.\nWe surmise that APT38 possibly deployed this tool to\ndistract investigators.\n\n- APT38 has also deployed the HERMES ransomware,\n\nwhich has been used by other financially motivated\ncyber crime actors. In this case, the ransomware was not\ncorrectly configured to collect ransom. We suspect this\nwas another technique employed by APT38 to distract\ninvestigators and destroy evidence.\n\n- Additionally, the NACHOCHEESE malware used by\n\nAPT38 contained poorly translated Russian-language\nstrings, which were likely included to misdirect\ninvestigators.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Attribution\n\n###### North Korean Infrastructure\nWe attribute APT38 to North Korean state-sponsored operators based on a combination of technical indicators\nlinking the activity to Pyongyang and details released by DOJ implicating North Korean national Park Jin Hyok\nin a criminal conspiracy. We assess with high confidence that these activities were directed and sponsored by\nthe North Korean government. Because the North Korean regime keeps strict control over communications and\ninternet infrastructure in the country, it is highly improbable that these operations could be conducted without\nthe knowledge or explicit sponsorship of the government.\n\n- The DOJ complaint also detailed two blocks of IP addresses used by Park in APT38 and other North Korean\n\noperations:\n\n**Table 1. North Korean IP address ranges**\n\n\n**North Korean IP Address Range** **Description**\n\n\n175.45.176.0 – 175.45.179.255 IP range registered to a company in Pyongyang\n\n\n210.52.109.0 – 210.52.109.255 IP range registered to a company in China but leased to\nNorth Korea\n\n\n\n- The use of these ranges by APT38 for their operations has been corroborated by third-party reporting:\n\n[—— A public report by Group-IB indicated APT38 logged into watering hole domains associated with (brou.com[.]](https://www.infosecurityeurope.com/__novadocuments/459994?v=636576773911930000)\n\nuy, cnbv.gob[.]mx knf.gov[.]pl) from two IPs (210.52.109.22 and 175.45.178.222) within the same North Korean IP\nranges.\n\n[—— A report by Kaspersky indicates APT38 also logged into an Apache Tomcat server used to host its malicious](https://securelist.com/lazarus-under-the-hood/77908/)\n\nfiles from the same IP range (175.45.176.0 -175.45.179.255) in January 2017.\n\n- As detailed in the DOJ complaint, a sample of WHITEOUT (aka Contopee) malware we attribute to APT38\n\nwas used between 2015 and 2016 against a Southeast Asian bank. The sample used a specific DDNS domain,\nonlink.epac[.]to, which was managed by an account at a DDNS provider. The same account was accessed on\nOctober 6, 2015 from a North Korean IP address.\n\n- As detailed in the DOJ complaint, the North Korean operators conducted reconnaissance on a Southeast Asian\n\nbank, including visiting its website, researching the business identifier code (BIC) used by the SWIFT system\nto uniquely identify the bank, and the BIC code for a corresponding bank needed to carry out the intended\nfraudulent transactions. This is evidence of shared motivation and intent to target the SWIFT system by the\nNorth Korean operators performing the reconnaissance and APT38 which later targeted that organization.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Shared Resources, Motivation\nMalware overlaps between APT38 and TEMP.Hermit\nhighlight the shared development resources accessible\nby multiple operational groups linked to North Korean\nstate-sponsored activity. Although these are disparate\noperations against different targets and rely on distinct\nTTPs, the malware tools being used either overlap\nor exhibit shared characteristics indicating a shared\ndeveloper or access to the same code repositories.\nAlthough APT38 is distinct from other TEMP.Hermit\nactivity, both groups operate consistently within the\ninterests of the North Korean state.\n\n- Malware similarities, including code overlap and shared\n\nfunctions, are a primary connection between APT38\nand other operations still attributed to TEMP.Hermit.\nFor additional malware similarity details, please see the\npreceding section.\n\n- APT38's increasingly aggressive targeting against\n\nbanks and other financial institutions has paralleled\nNorth Korea's worsening financial condition (Figure 4).\nSimilarly, TEMP.Hermit campaigns against U.S. defense\ncontractors and South Korean government offices\nand companies is consistent with other North Korean\nobjectives.\n\n###### Links to North Korean Military Units\nBased on details published in the DOJ complaint against\nNorth Korean programmer Park Jin Hyok, we know that\nAPT38 and other cyber operators linked to TEMP.Hermit\nare associated with Lab 110, an organization subordinate\nto or synonymous with the 6th Technical Bureau in North\nKorea's Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). The\norganization is believed to leverage front organizations to\nmask their activities, including infiltrating networks and\ngathering intelligence. These relationships are outlined in\nFigure 3.\n\n\n\n- [The DOJ complaint and open sources report that Lab](https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/141218_Cyber_Operations_North_Korea.pdf)\n\n110 operates out of front companies typically based in\nnortheast China. Identified fronts include Chosun Expo\nJoint Venture in Dalian and Chosun Baeksul Trading\nCompany in Shenyang.\n\n- Firsthand accounts, information provided by a foreign\n\ninvestigative agency, and common IP addresses used to\naccess the company website and associated accounts\nwhile connecting to and from North Korea corroborate\nreports that Chosun Expo was a front company\noperated by authorities in Pyongyang.\n\n- Similar units reportedly operate in other regions around\n\nthe world, including Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and\nother parts of China.\n\n- Malware developers and other adversary actors are\n\nbelieved to be recruited out of North Korea's universities\nand directly into military units, such as Lab 110. Schools\nreportedly feeding into these units include Kim Chaek\nUniversity of Technology and Kim Il Sung Military\nScience University.\n\n**Figure 10. Archived website for Chosun Expo Joint Venture**\n(Source: archive.fo)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Outlook and Implications\n\n\nAPT38's targeting of financial institutions is most likely\nan effort by the North Korean government to supplement\ntheir heavily-sanctioned economy. Stricter and more\ntargeted sanctions which expanded from restricting access\nto international banking systems to focusing on specific\nexports have most likely increased pressure significantly\n[and emboldened operations. Public reporting suggests](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/north-korea-criminal-empire-drugs-trafficking-1.4435265)\nNorth Korea has previously engaged in illicit activities\nsuch as smuggling and drug trade to raise currency and\nkeep its economy afloat. We judge APT38’s cyber heists\n[are extensions of these illicit activities. Published reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-02-07/inside-kim-jong-un-s-hacker-army)\nfrom North Korean defectors additionally provide details\non cyber-focused military units being tasked to generate\nincome for the regime, generally by engaging in various\ncybercriminal schemes including piracy and freelance\nprogramming work.\n\n\nWhile it is unclear how APT38’s operations will be affected\nby the recent DOJ complaint, it is notable that North\nKorean operators appear to be undeterred by public\noutings in the past. Furthermore, the timing of recent\nAPT38 operations provides some indication that even\ndiplomatic re-engagement will not motivate North Korea\nto rein in its illicit financially-motivated activities. Based on\nthe large scale of resources and vast network dedicated\nto compromising targets and stealing funds over the last\nfew years, we believe APT38’s operations will continue in\nthe future. In particular, the number of SWIFT heists that\nhave been ultimately thwarted in recent years coupled\nwith growing awareness for security around the financial\nmessaging system could drive APT38 to employ new\ntactics to obtain funds especially if North Korea’s access to\ncurrency continues to deteriorate.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Technical Annex: Malware Used by APT38\n\n**Table 2.
