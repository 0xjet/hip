However,\nrecently it has caught general attention due to several incidents that might mean a change of\nparadigm in the way such attacks have been addressed so far, mainly for two reasons presented\nbelow.\n\nFirst, from a technical perspective, it is remarkable that the bandwidth of some of the latest\nattacks skyrockets in comparison to what has been seen previously. On October 21, 2016, a\nseries of DDoS attacks against Dyn DNS (a DNS provider used by many important Internet\ncompanies) impacted the availability of a number of sites concentrated in the north-east of the\nUnited States and, later on, other areas of the USA. Impacted sites included among others:\nPayPal, Twitter, Reddit, GitHub, Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, and RuneScape. Also, earlier that\nmonth, the attacks against the Krebs on Security blog and the French Internet service and hosting\nprovider OVH reached 620 Gbps and 1.2 Tbps respectively [2].\n\nThe attack against the Krebs on Security blog trying to silence it – this blog has been very active\nexplaining the techniques and motivation of the DDoS threat actors [3] – is especially revealing\nabout this change of scale. The blog, which had been targeted by DDoS attacks previously,\nwas protected by the Akamai DDoS mitigation service. Akami was providing protection for free\ndue to the public relevance of this blog in the community. However following the attacks in\nOctober 2016, Akami was forced to cancel the service due to the huge resources needed for the\nmitigation:\n\n_Akamai had protected krebsonsecurity.com for four years, but the magnitude of the attacks seen_\n_during the final week were significantly larger than the majority of attacks Akamai sees on a regular_\n_basis. [4]_\n\nBotnets exploiting vulnerabilities in hundred of thousands of Internet connected devices, such\nas cameras, DVRs, and home DSL routers were behind an important part of these massive\nattacks. The fact that security was not one of the design targets for these devices was long\nconsidered a potential threat by the security community, which was often neglected by the\nmanufacturers. These potential threats have turned into serious incidents with many devices\naffected. On November 26, 2016, Deutsche Telekom announced an outage affecting over 900\n000 customers. The affected customers all had routers that were vulnerable to a specific exploit\nthat was incorporated into an Internet of Things (IoT) worm that was released on the Internet.\nThe aim of this worm was to add these devices under the control of one of the botnet masters.\nDuring that week, there was a peak of traffic related to that vulnerability – most prominently in\nBrazil and the UK [5, 6].\n\nThe second factor to be underlined is the fact that in August 2016 the code of one of the IoT\nbotnets was publicly released on Internet, which makes it much more easy for different threat\nactors to achieve such attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the IoT devices. It is difficult to\nassess at the moment, how this potentially easy proliferation of such botnets will affect the\nnumber and power of the attacks in the future.\n\nStrategies to mitigate DDoS need to be adopted. These should focus initially on prevention,\nbut eventually by designing multi-layered defense strategies. Therefore, DDoS threats should\n\n\n-----\n\nbe taken into account as part of Business Continuity Planning, along with issues such as site\nselection, power outages, and natural disasters.\n\nIn this document, CERT-EU has focused on procedures for securing IT infrastructure from threats\nagainst availability. The white-paper is based on proven DDoS identification and mitigation\nmethods that can effectively and efficiently respond to DDoS attacks.\n\n### 1.1 Target Audience\n\nThis document is aimed at general IT staff that has undertaken the responsibility of being prepared to respond to DDoS incident. This document only provides high-level guidelines. Different approaches are possible and may be valid. This document should rather be seen as a\nguideline in case of the absence of more specific local policies and procedures related to this\ntopic. It does not supersede any specific applicable policies or procedures, which should be\nfollowed if they exist.\n\nIn case of doubts or any additional questions about this document, do not hesitate to seek\nfurther advice and assistance from your respective authorities or CERT-EU team.\n\n## 2 DDoS Attack Categories\n\nThere are three primary categories of DDoS attacks [1]:\n\n**Volumetric Attacks: These include UDP, ICMP, and other (spoofed or not) packet floods. The**\nattack aims to saturate the bandwidth of the targeted resource. Magnitude is measured in bits\nper second. In this category it is important to underline the amplification attacks – attacks that\ntake advantages of the asymmetry design of some protocols (such as DNS and NTP) to flood the\nvictim with the answers to queries, which multiply many times the number of bits of the query.\n\n**Protocol Attacks: These include SYN floods, fragmented packet attacks, Smurf, and more. This**\ntype of attack consumes actual server resources or resources on the intermediate equipment,\nsuch as firewalls and load balancers. Magnitude is measured in packets per second.\n\n**Application Layer Attacks: These include slow POST, HashDos, GET flood, clogging and more.**\nThis attack sends data according to specific features of well-known applications such as HTTP,\nDNS, SMTP, SSL. Comprised of seemingly legitimate packets, the goal of these attacks is the\ndepletion of certain resources in the application. Magnitude is measured in requests per second.\n\nThe different layers potentially used by the DDoS attacks are presented in Figure 1.\n\n## 3 DDoS Threat Landscape\n\nGetting global information concerning the evolution of the DDoS attacks is not an easy task,\nbecause the information is spread between the ISPs and the targets of the attacks all around the\nInternet. For writing this white-paper, CERT-EU has reviewed the latest reports from two of the\nleading companies offering defense services against DDoS. These reports are based on the data\nrecorded by these defense networks and in one of them also on information from a periodic\ntechnical survey sent to its clients [7, 4]. The aim of this white-paper is not to reproduce nor\nsummarize these reports, but to offer some of the conclusions with analysis, but underlining the\noriginal sources.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: The layering of DDoS attacks on the OSI network model\n\nAccording to [7], 34% of the enterprise, government, and education organizations reported\nthat they have experienced DDoS attacks in 2015. Among those, over one-quarter indicated\nthat they suffered more than 10 attacks per month, and about half say the attacks exceeded\ntheir total Internet capacity. The motivation that these organizations attribute to these attacks\nis shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2: DDoS attack motivations\n\nThis data gives a predominant role in the DDoS attacks to criminal organizations in contrast\nto the information offered in the previous version of this white-paper, related to the year 2013\n\n[8]. Although the source is also different, such attribution can be supported by the evidence\nthat stresser tools/bots have been used much more often recently, in contrast with other typical\n_hacktivism tools (such as the famous LOIC) used previously._\n\n\n-----\n\nRegarding the attack size, in general the peak attack sizes and large attack frequency seem to\nhave increased dramatically over the last years [7]. A graph of the tendency of the size of the\nDDoS attacks over the last several years is presented in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3: Size of DDoS attacks in the rent years\n\nThe latest data available for the third quarter of 2016 shows – versus the same quarter of 2015\n– a 77% increase of the DDoS and a 138% increase of those bigger than 100Gps [7]. This trend\nis consistent with the recent attacks against the Krebs on Security blog and the French Internet\nservice and hosting provider OVH reached 620 Gbps and 1.2 Tbps respectively. It confirms the\ntrend of significant growth in the top-end size of DDoS attacks year-over-year.\n\nUDP fragments and DNS reflection continued to be the largest portion of the DDoS. The two\nvectors are strongly correlated, because a considerable amount of the UDP fragmentation traffic\nis caused by DNS traffic. Combined UDP fragmentation and DNS floods grew by 4.5% in the\nthird quarter of 2016, accounting for nearly 44% of the attack vectors reported by [7].\n\nThe evolution of the NTP protocol attacks presented in the quoted report is of special interest,\nbecause it seems that while the number of NTP attacks has grown over time, the amount of\ntraffic generated by each attack has decreased significantly. This is because the number of\nvulnerable servers has stabilized, after decreasing significantly due to the patching. Also there\nstarted to appear a competition between the attackers for the remaining resources, since this\nattack has improved its popularity during the last two years. During 2014, when the NTP\nvulnerability was published, CERT-EU started a scanning campaign reporting to the constituency\nwith a good rate of fixing the vulnerable servers. The same was done after that for DNS open\nresolvers and to prevent amplification attacks using the SNMP protocol.\n\nOn the other hand, stressers and botnets account for a large portion of the attack traffic in the\nlargest attacks. Usually different techniques are used in these largest attacks. Among them,\n**Mirai botnet has had an prominent role in the last few months. Rather than using reflectors,**\nMirai uses compromised IoT systems and generates traffic directly from those nodes. Mirai scans\nthe Internet for telnet services using well-known weak passwords present in many devices. The\ncode itself is downloaded during a telnet session using FTP. Mirai also terminates processes that\nbelong to competing botnets and closes its own attack vector.\n\nMirai can be highly tailored. The first version was capable of ten different attacks. Half of its\nsuccess is the use of the GRE protocol[1] as application layer attack. It is also resilient with respect\n\n1GRE protocol was developed by Cisco and allows to connect networks of different technologies through an IP\nnetwork by encapsulating its datagrams over IP packets\n\n\n-----\n\nto the availability of its C2 servers, and it has a great capacity of generating peak traffic without\nusing reflectors/amplification, because it has available a big number of vulnerable IoT devices\n\n[4].\n\nDue to the public release of the source code and ita extensible nature, new versions of the code\nhave been detected. In addition, according to statistics about the use of telnet service, they have\nskyrocketed in the last four months. It is than quite possible that we might see in the future\nattacks of several Tbps which might be the peak power of all the potential Mirai controlled\ndevices on the Internet.\n\nHowever, it is not easy to assess if (and if so - when) this potential threat will materialize. The\nattention received by Mirai after its release in the public domain might contribute to acceleration of the process described above related to the life cycle of the NTP amplifications attacks.\nIt may lead to many attackers competing for controlling the same resources. Although in this\ncase, the size of the potentially available resources to set up the attack is much bigger than in\nthe case of NTP amplification attacks.\n\n## 4 DDoS Mitigation\n\nAs mentioned, DDoS is one of the risks to be addressed in the organization Business Continuity\nPlan (BCP). The organization should start by assessing the likelihood of different scenarios and\nthe business impact for the organization. Only after understanding the consequences of a DDoS\nand its likelihood, the accountable managers for the affected service can start and support the\nneeded actions and plans to reduce the risk to a level they can accept.\n\nSome of the aspects that have to be taken into account are common for risk assessment supporting BCP. Following suggested points should be reviewed specifically for DDoS mitigation in\nthis analysis:\n\n  - On what IT assets the services depend on, and what are the relationships/dependencies\nbetween them. Ideally, it would be useful to have a dependency tree describing the connections between assets and services. For instance: knowing what databases are supporting what services, or what services might be affected, if it is decided to reduce the TTL\nin the DNS. Such information can be very useful in order to foresee the consequences of\nsome mitigation techniques.\n\n  - What are the external nodes in the dependency trees and which underpinning contracts\nassurance their availability. What are the contact points related to these resources to be\nreported to in case of a DDoS.\n\n  - What are the different scenarios that might be applicable concerning these dependency\ntrees; which are the single points of failure; which assets are critical to support more than\none service or the most critical service.\n\n  - What threats can by identified that can cause a fail in the dependency tree. Gathering\nfurther technical information about the assets and dependencies might help to foresee the\ntype of DDoS that the organization is most vulnerable to. For example, it does not make\nsense to publish through a Content Delivery Network of resources with high dependency\non dynamic content. Reviewing a DDoS attack which might target the assets that generate this dynamic content (such as the databases) might be more useful. In this phase,\nsome controlled stress-tests might be helpful to point to the weakest link in the chain of\ndependencies.\n\n\n-----\n\nHaving all that information, one can start to select the mitigation techniques and controls to be\nimplemented in the mitigation plan and its continuous improvement strategy.\n\nIn any case, CERT-EU recommends a formal approach to the risk assessment for those constituents which have been already attacked, as well as for those who have a high risk as result\nof a preliminary estimation. In order to achieve it, CERT-EU recommends to use the same risk\nassessment methodology that are used for the rest of IT security risk mitigation, but focus on\nthe availability of the information, instead of on confidentiality or integrity.\n\nDefending a site against a DDoS attack has both a fixed and a variable cost. The fixed costs\ncome in the form of locations, servers, and engineering. The variable, or operational, costs\ninclude the bandwidth served and manpower needed to mitigate attacks for the time they are\non-going [4]. From this perspective, mitigating DDoS is a business decision that should address\nwhat service should be still available under what kind of a DDoS attack and for how long. It is\nalso important to support the proper mitigation plan with the proper budget allocations and to\naccept the residual risk. It is important to remember that starting by considering only or mainly\ntechnical aspects might be misleading.\n\n### 4.1 Mitigation Techniques\n\nIt is important to underline that taking into account the strength of the latest attacks, it may be\nnecessary to hire specialist services, if continuous availability under a powerful DDoS attack is\nthe requirement of an organization. There have been several guides from different specialists\npublished that show possible approaches to facing such attacks [9, 10]\n\nSimilarly to the list of types of attacks, the list of mitigation techniques does not try to be\nexhaustive. It only offers a summary that can be extended by specialized literature. Eventually,\nthe techniques chosen should be tailored to reach the proper residual risk that the management\ncan or has to accept.\n\n  - Blocking the attack via FW/IPS. It can be useful with Layer 7 DDoS attacks when they\ncan be detected by signatures or when the source IPs make it feasible. On the other\nhand, these devices can be themselves targeted by network DDoS attacks, they are useless\nagainst reflective attacks, and in oder to work properly against DDoS attacks they might\nneed additional personnel training or specialist in the team.\n\n  - Auto-scale resources. Although theoretically possible in the cloud, might not be possible\nfor the back-end. In addition, it might not be setup fast enough to mitigate the attack.\n\n  - Adding mitigation DDoS hardware. It may be very useful to detect application-layer attacks early, which is very important to avoid that the services get affected. On the other\nhand, it might require to setup a specialist team in-house or will add an important overhead to the network administrators.\n\n  - Publishing service through a Content Delivery Network. It can be useful to absorb\nvolumetric attack for static content, but without other techniques might not address\napplication-layer attacks.\n\n  - Hiring DDoS scrubbing services. Theoretically they are able to just send to the organization the clean traffic after absorbing the attack, because they are supposed to have the\nintelligence to detect and discard most of the DDoS attack types. However, they might\nneed to be complemented with DNS and BGP solutions in order to be effective. In addition, considering the attack’s peak bandwidth seen lately, it might be really expensive for\nthe size of the resources required to mitigate such attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 4.2 DDoS Mitigation Plan\n\nAn effective immediate response is difficult and may depend on third parties, such as ISPs and\nDDoS mitigation specialists. These external partners have large scale infrastructures and use a\nvariety of technologies for identification, containment, and remediation. Therefore, DDoS attacks can sometimes be identified and mitigated before they reach the organization’s premises.\nAdditional tasks, especially in case of attacks on the network-layer, such as bandwidth prioritization and sinkholing may be performed at end-user/organization level.\n\nThe following list summarizes the proposed DDoS mitigation guide:\n\n1. Preparation\n\n    - contacts and procedures\n\n    - ISP and specialized support\n\n    - network & infrastructure setups\n2. Identification\n\n    - detection and alerting\n\n    - attack analysis\n\n    - motivation identification\n\n    - mitigation acquirement/refinement\n\n    - traceback\n3.

Nowadays, it is not possible to find any important political movement or\ncampaign without Internet presence. Hacktivism is simply a way protests and demonstrations\nhave moved to Internet. Hence, it is likely that hacktivism (and the DDoS threat it is associated\nwith) will play even more important role also in the future.\n\nHowever, recent data gives a predominant role in the DDoS attacks to criminal organizations.\nWith the increased use of stresser tools and botnets, much larger volumetric attacks are now\npossible. These new tools can be easily used for criminal purposes and for financial gain, but\nalso possibly to achieve political means of certain groups, parties, or even nation-states.\nThese possibilities have to be kept in mind when evaluating and deciding on how to prepare\nagainst the potential DDoS attacks.\n\nConsequently, the main ideas that CERT-EU would offer for consideration in order to face such\nissues, are:\n\n  - Institutions should establish their availability requirements clearly. It might have different\nimplications for critical services that must be available (even with legal implications),\nsuch as publications in the Official Dairy or on-line call-for-tenders than for resources that\nmight support and explain public policies or political decisions.\n\n  - It is very important to know in advance the weakest links and bottlenecks that might\nthreaten this availability requirements in case of a DDoS attack. In order to do that, a\ncomprehensive risk assessment is highly recommended.\n\n  - Taking into account the latest attack strength, it might be required to hire specialist help or\nconsultancy services to address demanding availability requirements. CERT-EU can help\nthe constituency to analyze the proposals they might have from a vendor-neutral point of\nview.\n\nFinally, in case of a DDoS attack, reporting the incident and investigating various aspects, such\nas the threat actors involved or the techniques used, can help for the global security on Internet.\n\n## 6 References\n\n[[1] http://www.incapsula.com/ddos/ddos-attacks/denial-of-service](http://www.incapsula.com/ddos/ddos-attacks/denial-of-service)\n\n\n-----\n\n[[2] https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/action-analysis-mirai-botnet-attacks-dyn/](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/action-analysis-mirai-botnet-attacks-dyn/)\n\n[[3] https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/ddos/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/ddos/)\n\n[4] [https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/q3-2016-state-of-](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/q3-2016-state-of-the-internet-security-report.pdf)\n[the-internet-security-report.pdf](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/q3-2016-state-of-the-internet-security-report.pdf)\n\n[5] [http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/inside-the-machine-uprising-how-](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/inside-the-machine-uprising-how-cameras-dvrs-took-down-parts-of-the-internet/)\n[cameras-dvrs-took-down-parts-of-the-internet/](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/inside-the-machine-uprising-how-cameras-dvrs-took-down-parts-of-the-internet/)\n\n[[6] https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/new-mirai-variant-involved-latest-deutsche-telekom-outage/](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/new-mirai-variant-involved-latest-deutsche-telekom-outage/)\n\n[[7] https://www.arbornetworks.com/insight-into-the-global-threat-landscape](https://www.arbornetworks.com/insight-into-the-global-threat-landscape)\n\n[8] [http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130912005038/en/NSFOCUS-Mid-Year-DDoS-](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130912005038/en/NSFOCUS-Mid-Year-DDoS-Threat-Report-2013-Details)\n[Threat-Report-2013-Details](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130912005038/en/NSFOCUS-Mid-Year-DDoS-Threat-Report-2013-Details)\n\n[[9] https://www.imperva.com/docs/gated/WP_Incapsula_DDoS_Response_Playbook.pdf](https://www.imperva.com/docs/gated/WP_Incapsula_DDoS_Response_Playbook.pdf)\n\n[10] [http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/traffic-anomaly-detector-xt-](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/traffic-anomaly-detector-xt-5600a/prod_white_paper0900aecd8011e927.pdf)\n[5600a/prod_white_paper0900aecd8011e927.pdf](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/traffic-anomaly-detector-xt-5600a/prod_white_paper0900aecd8011e927.pdf)\n\n\n-----",
