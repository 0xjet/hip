As these attacks encrypt hundreds, if not thousands, of\ndevices, they tend to have a huge impact on operators and the attackers demand a very\nlarge ransom.\n\nThe ransomware operators state they have created this site as a threat to victims that if they\ndo not pay, their data and names will be leaked by the attackers.\n\n**The 'Dopple Leaks' Site**\nThe ransomware operators have told BleepingComputer that this new site is in \"test mode\"\nand is currently being used mostly for shaming their victims and to publish a few files that\nwere stolen from victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Pemex information on the DoppelPaymer site**\nCurrently listed on this page are four companies that DoppelPaymer claims to have\nencrypted and who did not pay the ransom.\n\nOther than Pemex, BleepingComputer will only share descriptions of the other listed\ncompanies and the demanded ransoms that were shared with us by the DoppelPaymer\noperators.\n\nA merchant account company based out of USA with a ransom amount of 15 bitcoins\n(~$150K).\nA French cloud hosting and enterprise telecommunications company with a ransom of\n35 bitcoins (~$330K)\nA logistics & supply chain company based out of South Africa was encrypted on\nJanuary 20th, 2020 with a ransom amount of 50 bitcoins (~$500K).\n[Mexico's state-owned oil company Pemex was attacked by DoppelPaymer on](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mexicos-pemex-oil-suffers-ransomware-attack-49-million-demanded/)\nNovember 10th, 2019. The attackers demanded 568 bitcoins ($4.9 million at the\ntime) for a decryptor.\n\nOf all the sites, DoppelPaymer told us that they only stole a large amount of \"still unsorted\"\nfiles from Pemex.\n\nFor the other three companies, they only stole a few files because there was \"nothing\ninteresting\" or because \"it was not our goal\".\n\n\n-----\n\nThey stated that they do plan on performing more data exfiltration now that this site has been\ncreated.\n\n## Treat ransomware attacks like data breaches!\n\nBleepingComputer has repeatedly stated that ransomware attacks have to be treated like\ndata breaches.\n\nFor years, it is has been a well-known secret that ransomware attackers are looking through\nand stealing victim's files before encrypting computers and then threatening to release them.\n\nIt was [not until recently, though, that ransomware operators have followed through with their](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/allied-universal-breached-by-maze-ransomware-stolen-data-leaked/)\nthreats.\n\nNow that they are doing so and more ransomware operators are getting on board,\ncompanies need to be transparent about the data theft and treat these attacks like data\nbreaches.\n\nThis is because it is not only corporate data being stolen, but also vendor and client data and\nthe personal information of employees.\n\nTransparency is more important now than ever and hiding these attacks is putting their\nemployees at long-term risk as their data is exposed to identity theft and fraud.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[Karakurt revealed as data extortion arm of Conti cybercrime syndicate](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/karakurt-revealed-as-data-extortion-arm-of-conti-cybercrime-syndicate/)\n\n[Snap-on discloses data breach claimed by Conti ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/snap-on-discloses-data-breach-claimed-by-conti-ransomware-gang/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
