T-DE is not aware of the infections allowing\ncustomers to download and install infected PLC software for the initial purposes of cyber espionage. Long term intentions include\npossible physical sabotage operations. The PLCs appear to be genuine production parts with malware introduced post\nproduction. Verification of Oleg Vladimirovich Strekozov’s identity is incomplete; the name is likely fictitious and probably statesponsored. Evidence that suggests this outcome:\n\nMalware Targets SCADA Devices\n\nTTPs are like Dragonfly or Energetic Bear (B2)\nTargeting SCADA devices is consistent with espionage practices (B2)\n\nProvides hackers a foothold into US critical infrastructure Delta Website in Taiwan\nA copycat website in Russia is suspicious and consistent with masquerade techniques (C3)\nA legitimate Russian business would not conduct themselves in such a way (C2)\nMultiple other sites deliver the same software (C3) …\n\n[The full report: Intelligence Games in the Power Grid – 2016](https://treadstone71llc.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/intelligence-games-in-the-power-grid-2016.pdf)\n\n[The associated PPTX: Treadstone 71 Intelligence Games in the Power Grid](https://treadstone71llc.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/treadstone-71-intelligence-games-in-the-power-grid.pdf)\n\nMany of the original files are located here: http://ow.ly/3Ly730f2P0A\n\nUse Hybrid-Analysis.com or https://joesecurity.org/\n\nRecent reports from Symantec:\n\n[http://www.eweek.com/security/dragonfly-2.0-hackers-targeting-the-energy-sector-symantec-finds](http://www.eweek.com/security/dragonfly-2.0-hackers-targeting-the-energy-sector-symantec-finds)\n\n[https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/dragonfly-western-energy-sector-targeted-sophisticated-attack-group](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/dragonfly-western-energy-sector-targeted-sophisticated-attack-group)\n\n\n-----\n\n**[DELTA ELECTRONICS](https://cybershafarat.com/tag/delta-electronics/)** **[DELTA ELEKTRONIKS](https://cybershafarat.com/tag/delta-elektroniks/)** **[ENERGY](https://cybershafarat.com/tag/energy/)** **[HACKING](https://cybershafarat.com/tag/hacking/)** **[MILITARY](https://cybershafarat.com/tag/military/)** **[OPEN SOURCE](https://cybershafarat.com/tag/open-source/)** **[PLC](https://cybershafarat.com/tag/plc/)** **[SCADA](https://cybershafarat.com/tag/scada/)** **[STUXNET](https://cybershafarat.com/tag/stuxnet/)** **[TECHNIQUES](https://cybershafarat.com/tag/techniques/)**\n\n## Published by Treadstone 71\n\n@Treadstone71LLC cyber intelligence, counterintelligence, infiltration, OSINT, Clandestine Cyber HUMINT, cyber intel and\n[OSINT training and analysis, cyber psyops, strategic cyber security, Interim CISO Services View all posts by Treadstone 71](https://cybershafarat.com/author/jeffbardin/)\n\n**[© 2017 THE CYBER SHAFARAT - TREADSTONE 71](https://cybershafarat.com/)**\n\n**[BLOG AT WORDPRESS.COM.](https://wordpress.com/?ref=footer_blog)**\n\n\n-----",
