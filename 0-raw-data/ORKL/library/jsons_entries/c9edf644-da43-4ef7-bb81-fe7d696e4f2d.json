The group mainly attempts to collect by distributing\nmalware and taking over accounts through spear-phishing attacks. Attacks have mainly\ntargeted Windows, though instances of attacks on Android devices have likewise been\ndiscovered.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In November 2020, we found the mobile version of the AppleSeed family used by Kimsuky](https://youtu.be/UIzhecstLyg?t=949)\ngroup. In that sample, the group even called themselves Thallium, a name given by\n[Microsoft. We published our analysis on VB2021 localhost.](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2021-Kim-etal.pdf)\n\nIn April 2021, a malicious APK disguised as a mobile security program of KISA (Korea\n[Internet & Security Agency) to which KrCERT/CC belongs was distributed. The APK was](https://twitter.com/shadowchasing1/status/1388529890614341635)\nalso a mobile version of the AppleSeed family. When infected with a malicious APK, it\ncommunicates with the C&C server using the HTTP/S protocol, receives commands, and\nperforms malicious behaviors such as stealing information from the infected device.\n\nS2W’s threat research and intelligence center, Talon, recently identified three new types of\nmalware that target Android devices in the process of tracking the Kimsuky group. We\nnamed the three malicious APKs FastFire, FastViewer, and FastSpy by adding ‘Fast’\nincluded in the package name of each malicious APK and the characteristics of each.\n\n1. is a malicious APK currently being developed by the Kimsuky group, disguised as a\n\nGoogle security plug-in. It receives commands from Firebase, an app development\nplatform backed by Google, rather than receiving commands from the C&C through\nHTTP/S communication as in the traditional method.\n2. malware disguises itself as “Hancom Viewer”, a mobile viewer program that can read\n\nthe Hangul documents (.hwp) used in Korea, and downloads additional malware after\nstealing information from an infected device.\n3. The FastViewer malware downloads, and receives commands from the attacker’s\n\nserver through TCP/IP protocol. FastSpy is developed based on the source code of\nAndroSpy, a remote control tool for Android devices that was released as an .\n\n## FastFire malware disguised as Google Security Plugin\n\nAnalyzing the IP of the C&C server domain used by the Kimsuky group in the past, we found\na suspected malicious APK that the Kimsuky group is developing to target mobile devices. It\nis named “FastFire” as its package name contains “fastsecure” and uses the “Firebase” for\nC&C communication.\n\nAll antivirus vendors in VirusTotal have not classified the APK as malicious so far.\n(detection result 0/64, as of 2022.10.18)\n\nThe malicious APK has a package name com.viewer.fastsecure and disguises Google\nSecurity Plugin. After installation, it hides its launcher icon so that the victim does not know\nthat it is installed.\n\nAPK File Certificate Information ()\n\n## Detailed analysis of FastFire\n\n\n-----\n\nFastFire contains five malicious classes. After installation, only three classes are actually\nexecuted, and two classes are not. FastFire transmits a device token to the C&C server, and\nthen the C&C server sends a command to the infected device through Firebase Cloud\nMessaging (FCM).\n\n**1. Request a permission**\n\nWhen FastFire is executed, MainActivity class is executed first, and “You must grant\n_permission to the Google Security Plugin in order to be safely downloaded.” message is_\ndisplayed, and the MANAGE_OVERLAY_PERMISSION permission is requested. If\npermission is granted, the message “Downloaded safely” is displayed.\n\n**2. C&C Communication in Services**\n\nIn the manifest file in FastFire, two classes are specified to be executed as services. Of\nthese, only the MyFirebaseMessagingService class is actually executed.\n\nStartModuleService\n\nThe StartModuleService class is specified on the manifest, but it is not actually executed\nwhen FastFire is running. This class performs the function of reading a specific HTML page\nthrough the Android VIEW indent.\n\nstartmodule\n\n_startmodule class is not in the manifest nor is it called by another class, but a malicious code_\nis implemented. Kimsuky group conducts phishing attacks disguised as the site to hijack the\naccounts of large Korean portal sites such as Naver and Daum, FastFire malware also\ntargets the two portal sites. If the string “naver”, “daum” or “facebook” exists in the value\nreceived as an argument when calling the startmodule class, it connects to the C&C server\nand gets an HTML page. As that class is not actually called, it is likely still in development.\n\nhxxp[:]//mc.pzs[.]kr/themes/mobile/images/about/temp/android/naver.html\nhxxp[:]//mc.pzs[.]kr/themes/mobile/images/about/temp/android/daum.html\nhxxp[:]//mc.pzs[.]kr/themes/mobile/images/about/temp/android/facebook.html\n\nMyFirebaseMessagingService\n\nFirebase is a mobile development platform that provides various necessary functions such\nas DB, authentication, and messaging. Using this, message payloads can include a\nnotification property that the Firebase SDKs intercept and attempt to display a visible\nnotification to users.\n\n\n-----\n\n_MyFirebaseMessagingService class performs malicious behaviors by receiving commands_\nthrough Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). FastFire generates a device token to use FCM,\nand the token value is transmitted to the C&C server. After obtaining the token, the attacker\nmakes a request to Firebase to send a message payload containing the attacker’s command\nto the infected device. In response to the request, Firebase sends a message to the device.\n\nhxxp[:]//navernnail[.]com/fkwneovjubske4gv/report_token/report_token.php?token=\n\n[Device token]\n\nWhen the command is received, the onMessageRecived method is executed to perform an\naction. If the data of my_custom_key exists in the message, FastFire reads an HTML file\nfrom the C&C server and connects the deep link that takes the user to a specific page in an\napp. The HTML file according to whether the value is “naver”, “daum”, or “facebook”.\n\nhxxp[:]//navernnail[.]com/fkwneovjubske4gv/android/naver.html\nhxxp[:]//navernnail[.]com/fkwneovjubske4gv/android/daum.html\nhxxp[:]//navernnail[.]com/fkwneovjubske4gv/android/facebook.html\n\n**3. Additional C&C Server and Malicious Pages**\n\nAfter further analysis of FastFire’s infrastructure, an additional domain assigned to the\nResolved IP of FastFire’s C&C server was discovered. Since the domain has specific HTML\nfiles in the same directory path as FastFire’s, it is also identified as another C&C server used\nby Kimsuky.\n\nFastFire‘s C&C Server: navernnail[.]com ()\nAdditional C&C server: goooglesecurity[.]com ()\n\nThe HTML file obtained from the additional C&C server performs the function of calling a\nspecific application through a deep link on an Android device. FastFire takes the user to a\nspecific page in an app using the deep link according to the command, but the values in the\nsecured HTML were all unidentified. The attacker is expected to fill in that value with a test\nAPK name “[Target]_host” or a random string for the test.\n\nGenerally, the notification sent from Firebase is handled with the onMessageReceived\nmethod. However, the feature is not performed as the method is not implemented. Also, in a\nseparate function for testing notifications, related messages Facebook and Google are\nincluded in Turkish.\n\nIn addition, a file “fcm.html” was secured, and it calls the fcm_host through the deep link and\ndownloads additional malicious code.\n\nhxxp[:]//goooglesecurity[.]com/fkwneovjubske4gv/android/fcm.html\n\n\n-----\n\nAs such, FastFire is believed to be a new mobile malware currently being developed by the\nKimsuky group in that the deep link calling function is not yet properly implemented and there\nare classes that are not actually executed.\n\n## FastViewer & FastSpy disguised as Hancom Office Viewer\n\nIn addition to FastFire, we discovered mobile RAT that impersonates the “Hancom Office\nViewer”. “Hancom Office Viewer” is a mobile document viewer application used to view\nMicrosoft Word, PDF, or ‘Hangul (.hwp)’ documents and the number of downloads on the\nGoogle Play store is over 10 million.\n\n**FastViewer normally performs a document viewer, but when reading a document file**\n**specially created by an attacker, it performs malicious behaviors. The first 4 bytes of the**\nfile are checked to determine whether the document was created by the attacker, and if the\nconditions are met, device information is transmitted to the C&C server. After that,\nFastViewer additionally downloads FastSpy malware and executes it in memory to perform\nadditional malicious actions.\n\nFastViewer is a repackaged APK by adding arbitrary malicious code inserted by an attacker\nto the normal Hancom Office Viewer app, and the package name, app name, and icon are\nvery similar to the normal app.\n\n8420236c32f0991feaa7869549abdb97 (Hancom Office Viewer\n3458daa0dffdc3fbb5c931f25d7a1ec0 (FastViewer)\n\nFastViewer is signed with jks certificate (Java-based certificate format). The certificate\n[information is as follows. (Link)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HHbmiw_7XhlPBgzXYm7Hoi58Vb4ytfxBSGiMKTrU5uo/edit#gid=1740468069)\n\nFastViewer\n\n## Detailed analysis of FastViewer & FastSpy\n\n**1. String decryption algorithm**\n\nThe string used in FastViewer is decrypted by the custom algorithm. The encrypted string is\nused as the first argument, and the index of the key table is used as the second argument.\nAfter obtaining a key pair using the value of the XOR key table corresponding to the index,\nXOR is performed alternately from the back of the encrypted string.\n\n**2. Request permissions**\n\nFastViewer requests additional permissions from users for malicious actions such as\nreceiving commands, persistence, and spying. FastViewer abuses accessibility, so it is\nchecked whether accessibility is enabled before performing malicious behaviors.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The class name that requests the permissions is HiPermission, which is an open-source](https://github.com/yewei02538/HiPermission)\nthat has been released in the past. It is believed that Kimsuky group partially modified the\nsource code and applied it to FastViewer.\n\n**3. Check the header of document files**\n\nMalicious behavior operates when a special document file created by an attacker is read, by\nchecking whether the first 4 bytes of the file are “EDC%”. It then changes “EDC%” to the\noriginal 4 bytes, converting it to a normal document and displaying it to the user, executing\nmalicious behavior in the background.\n\nAccording to the calling condition, malicious behavior is performed that meets the condition\naccording to the variable “StrOpt”.\n\n**4. C&C Communication**\n\nFastViewer collects the information of the device and sends it to the C&C server as an ati\nparameter. If the app acquires permissions on the device and successfully gets the Device’s\nIMEI value, the ati parameter is assigned “Kur-{Device IMEI}_{Device IMEI}”. If IMEI value\ncannot be acquired due to permission failure or other problems, ati is assigned “Kurnull_error_imei”.\n\n(Success) hxxp://23.106.122[.]16/dash/index.php?&ati=\n(Fail) hxxp://23.106.122[.]16/dash/index.php?&ati=\n\nAfter that, the data that FastViewer receives from the C&C server is as follows, and it\ndetermines whether to download additional modules by comparing the version variable\ndefined in the FastViewer with the version value received from the server. If the response\nvalue is “ok”, only simple information stealing is performed, and an additional module is not\ndownloaded.\n\n(Response)\nversion:0|rat:on|ip:23.106.122[.]16|port:4545|package:com.example.res|interval:120\n\nAs above, when information about the additional module is successfully received, the\nrequest for downloading the module is sent to the C&C server. The version value is the value\nreceived from the server.\n\n(Download request) hxxp://23.106.122[.]16/dash/patch.php?name=Image.bin&ati=\n\n**5. Download an additional module — FastSpy**\n\nThe downloaded module is a compressed DEX file, and the original data is extracted through\nbase64 decoding and GZIP decompression in memory. The extracted file is FastSpy which\nperforms remote control.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter data extraction, the malicious class in the DEX in memory is dynamically called by\ncalling the LoadClass API that matches the SDK version of the device. If the class is\nsuccessfully called, the decrypted DEX is saved as image{version}.bin in the app install path.\n\nInstall Path: {App install path}/image{version}.bin\nFilename: image0.bin (version: 0)\nPackage Name: com.example.res\nMD5 hash (Compressed): aefa23b91cc667be041cad40abbfa043\nMD5 hash (Extracted): 89f97e1d68e274b03bc40f6e06e2ba9a\n\nWhen FastSpy is executed, the internally stored C&C server information is compared with\nthe information previously received from the C&C server. If the two values are different, the\ninformation is updated in memory with the information received from the server.\n\nInternally stored C&C server information\nFastSpy could abuse the accessibility API obtained from FastViewer to get additional\nprivileges without the user’s consent. If FastSpy requests specific permission for malicious\nbehaviors, a pop-up window requesting permission is displayed. In this case, FastSpy\nautomates the function of clicking the “Agree” button in the window, so that FastSpy acquires\nthe permission itself without interaction with users. However, it isn’t actually called in FastSpy\nwe secured.\n\n[The above method is similar to the method used by the previous Malibot malware to bypass](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/f5-labs-investigates-malibot)\nGoogle MFA authentication.\n\nsendAutoAction\nFastSpy can take control of infected devices, hijack phone and SMS information, or identify\nthe device’s location and whether it is used via camera, microphone, speaker, GPS, or\nKeyStroke in real-time.\n\nIn addition, the attacker can access files on the infected device and send them to the C&C\nserver. To exfiltrate, the file is compressed with the gzip algorithm and base64 encoding as\nused in FastSpy.\n\n## Correlation between FastSpy and AndroSpy\n\nFastSpy and AndroSpy have similar characteristics in the method name, message format,\nfunctions, and code. AndroSpy is an open-source RAT malware that was released in 2018\nand has the characteristic that methods and key variables are in Turkish.\n\n## Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nAs a result of analyzing the association between the FastFire, FastViewer, and FastSpy\nmalware and Kimsuky group, it was found that the FastFire’s C&C server domain also used\nin the “다양한 주제의 보도자료를 사칭한 Kimsuky 공격시도” performed by Kimsuky group in\nthe past.\n\nComparing the C&C URL released at the time and FastFire’s C&C URL, the same domain\nwas used for both campaigns, and the path under the temp directory was used. In addition,\nthe group mainly impersonates Korean large portal sites (Naver and Daum) in order to steal\ninformation from the target.\n\nThe domains (navernnail[.]com, goooglesecurity[.]com) used by the FastFire malware have a\nhistory of pivoting to 23[.]106.122.16 in the past, and this IP was also used as a distribution\nsite and C&C server for FastViewer and FastSpy.\n\nIn that, the signature date of FastViewer and that of FastFire are included within the period in\nwhich the navernnail[.]com domain which was bound to 23[.]106.122.16 (Singapore), all\nthree malware and infrastructure are used by Kimsuky at the same time.\n\nIn addition, the fact that goooglesecurity[.]com, an additionally verified C&C server of\nFastFire, also supports this point.\n\nOverlapped time\nFigure 26. Overall infrastructure\nDuring the analysis, there was a directory listing vulnerability in navernnail[.]com, so we were\nable to collect files existing on the server. Among them, the key_ps.txt file has a code similar\nto the keylogging script used by the Kimsuky group in the past, and the same mutex name is\nalso used.\n\nFilename: key_ps.txt\nMD5 : 5D56371944DEC9DA57DB95D0199DD920\nMutex name: Global\\AlreadyRunning191122\nReference:\n\nDirectory Listing\nFigure 28. Kimsuky’s keylogger script (key_ps.txt)\nIn addition, the info_sc.txt file was also confirmed to have similarities with Kimsuky group.\nFebruary 18, 2022, the malicious document disguised as the customer center of Klip, a\nvirtual asset wallet service in Korea, downloaded a very similar script.\n\nReference:\n\nLeft: 2022–02–18 1589989024.xml / Right: info_sc.txt\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nKimsuky group has continuously performed attacks to steal the target s information targeting\nmobile devices. Firebase, a normal service used as the C&C server in FastFire, is their\nadvanced tactic. In addition, various attempts are being made to bypass detection by\ncustomizing Androspy, an open-source RAT. In the future, caution is required as the Kimsuky\ngroup may distribute malicious codes with similar functions and variants to Android devices.\n\nLike FastViewer, sophisticated attack vectors are used to attack only specific targets, and\nexisting open sources are actively used to create high-performance variants such as\n**FastSpy. Since Kimsuky group’s mobile targeting strategy is getting more advanced, it is**\nnecessary to be careful about sophisticated attacks targeting Android devices.\n\n## Appendix A.
