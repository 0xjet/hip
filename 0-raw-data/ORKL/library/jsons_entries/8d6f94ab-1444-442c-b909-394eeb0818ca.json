    "plain_text": "# Kitten.gif: Meet the Sabbath Ransomware Affiliate Program, Again\n\n**mandiant.com/resources/sabbath-ransomware-affiliate**\n\nBlog\n\nTyler McLellan, Brandan Schondorfer\n\nNov 29, 2021\n\n10 mins read\n\nRansomware\n\nThreat Research\n\nUncategorized Groups (UNC Groups)\n\nIn September 2021, Mandiant discovered a post on exploit.in seeking partners for a new ransomware affiliate program. By October 21, 2021,\nthe 54BB47h (Sabbath) ransomware shaming site and blog were created and quickly became the talk of security researchers. In contrast with\nmost other affiliate programs, Mandiant observed two occasions where the ransomware operator provided its affiliates with pre-configured\nCobalt Strike BEACON backdoor payloads. While the use of BEACON is common practice in ransomware intrusions, the use of a ransom\naffiliate program operator provided BEACON is unusual and offers both a challenge for attribution efforts while also offering additional avenues\nfor detection.\n\nMandiant Advanced Practices began proactively identifying similar BEACON infrastructure across past Mandiant Consulting engagements,\nAdvanced Practices external adversary discovery program, and commercially available malware repositories. Through this analysis, Advanced\nPractices linked the new Sabbath group to ransom activity under previously used names including Arcane and Eruption.\n\nUNC2190, operating as Arcane and Sabbath, has targeted critical infrastructure including education, health, and natural resources in the\nUnited States and Canada since June 2021. The targeting of critical infrastructure by ransomware groups has become increasingly concerning\nas evidenced by governments moving to target ransomware actors as national security level threats with particular attention to groups that\ntarget and disrupt critical infrastructure.\n\n## Stealthy Ransomware\n\nIn July 2020, UNC2190 deployed ROLLCOAST ransomware while branded as Eruption. Mandiant has not observed samples of UNC2190deployed ransomware in 2021 and no samples of ROLLCOAST have ever been submitted to VirusTotal. In the following sections, some of the\ntechnical reasons why UNC2190’s ransomware has evaded capture and discovery will be discussed.\n\n## Next Level Extortion and ‘Backup Killers’\n\n\n-----\n\nSabbat st ca e to g t Octobe 0 e t e g oup pub c y s a ed a d e to ted a US sc oo d st ct o [edd t a d](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecOpsDaily/comments/qfkpgc/the_new_ransomware_group_54bb47h_seem_to_have/) o a o\nsuspended Twitter account, @54BB47h. During this recent extortion, the threat actor demanded a multi-million-dollar payment after deploying\n[ransomware. Media reporting indicated that the group took the unusually aggressive step of emailing staff, parents and even students directly](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/howdy-hackers-email-parents-and-students-after-allen-isd-refuses-to-pay-ransom/2758256/)\nto further apply public pressure on the school district.\n\n@54BB47h on Twitter\n\nUNC2190 uses a multifaceted extortion model where ransomware deployment may be quite limited in scope, bulk data is stolen as leverage,\nand the threat actor actively attempts to destroy backups.\n\nRansom note example\n\nThe threat actor has utilized public data leaks to extort the victims to pay ransom demands. While Sabbath operates a public shaming blog,\nMandiant only observed victims being publicly extorted beginning in mid-November 2021, where 6 victims were added over the span of two\ndays. Previously under the Arcane brand, Mandiant observed three victims publicly extorted in June 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nSource: Reddit SecOpsDaily\n\n## Arcane Rebranded\n\nMandiant discovered that the new Sabbath public shaming web portal and blog first published in October 2021 is nearly identical to that of\nArcane from June 2021. This included the same text content, and minor changes to the name, color scheme, and logo. The threat actor kept\nconsistent grammatical errors in their updated web forums.\n\nSabbath\n\n54bb47h5qu4k7l4d7v5ix3i6ak6elysn3net4by4ihmvrhu7cvbskoqd.onion Website October 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nthearcane.top website June 2021\n\nBehind the scenes, few technical changes were made to the affiliate model used to carry out the attacks between the rebranding from Arcane\nto Sabbath. BEACON samples and infrastructure from both ransomware affiliate services remained unchanged. The malware sample PE\ncompile times were identical on Themida-packed BEACON droppers used by the threat actor (such as md5\n6bd1a3849bb9d5f9ac5b4f4049081334 and 38667bc3ad2dcef35a5f343a5073e3f2).\n\n## Hunting for UNC2190 BEACON Samples\n\n[Since July 2020, UNC2190 has utilized BEACON with unique Malleable profile elements, including:](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/defining-cobalt-strike-components)\n\nGET requests ending with kitten.gif, such as:\n\nhxxps://markettc.biz/gifs/ZsoCzxU-X-5D3ZhV2zzKgc8SHhygCYmWpBRCS_mRV_SZxyWaaSPw7FFtcZ66twQ_uTDp5Edls\n\nmRa6K8GPtMVBnKOHhM6EgcnE4znZPiyXskZJXmHLSYAnkpLwhOrxyCoRkFthelDg\n\nVnuW7k3UVzDjEz3W4xuxSKBq2DuseaG-F0dob1M/kitten.gif\nPOST variable “image_url”, points to a specific image hosted on popular Russian social media site VK: hxxps://sun923.userapi.com/G4JvdZDEfLdIPlNN1-JkMGQ2unf2KEIV54Om5g/abJ70jGHfVk.jpg\nUser agent, such as: \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.163\nSafari/537.36\"\n\nMandiant discovered additional infrastructure similarities utilized by UNC2190 including:\n\nActual IPs masked using a cloud service.\nSelf-signed TLS certificate common name “Microsoft IT TLS CA 5”\n\n## Evolving to Evade Antivirus Detection\n\nIn March 2021, Mandiant Consulting observed an intrusion for another tracked UNC group where antivirus had detected and blocked two\nattempts to load a BEACON payload which Mandiant attributes to UNC2190. Subsequently, a different tracked threat actor deployed different\nransomware at this victim with more success. Starting July 6, 2021, Mandiant detected the use of Themida to pack UNC2190 BEACON\nmalware and protect it from detection.\n\n## ROLLCOAST Ransomware Deep Dive\n\nIn July 2020, Mandiant first detected ROLLCOAST ransomware usage by UNC2190. ROLLCOAST\n\nis a ransomware program that encrypts files on logical drives attached to a system. ROLLCOAST is a Dynamic Linked Library (DLL) with no\nnamed exports. When observed by Mandiant it uniquely had only one ordinal export 0x01. This suggested the sample was designed to avoid\ndetection and be invoked within memory, possibly through BEACON provided to affiliates. Incident responders working on similar intrusions\nshould capture memory for analysis. ROLLCOAST was not written to disk during this intrusion and was only detected in memory by Mandiant.\n\nThe malware begins by checking the system language and exits if it detects a non-supported language code from the table below. Many other\nransomware families have similar checks to avoid encrypting systems in Russia and other Commonwealth of Independent States member\ncountries presumably to avoid attracting the attention of law enforcement in countries where the ransomware operator and affiliates are more\nlikely to reside.\n\n## Language Exclusions\n\nROLLCOAST will exit if the system language matches one of the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Language ID** **Description**\n\n0x419 Russian (Russia)\n\n0x41A Croatian (Croatia)\n\n0x41B Slovak (Slovakia)\n\n0x41C Albanian (Albania)\n\n0x41D Swedish (Sweden)\n\n0x41E Thai (Thailand)\n\n0x41F Turkish (Turkey)\n\n0x420 Urdu (Islamic Republic of Pakistan)\n\n0x421 Indonesian (Indonesia)\n\n0x422 Ukrainian (Ukraine)\n\n0x423 Belarusian (Belarus)\n\n0x424 Slovenian (Slovenia)\n\n0x425 Estonian (Estonia)\n\n0x426 Latvian (Latvia)\n\n0x427 Lithuanian (Lithuania)\n\n0x428 Tajik (Cyrillic, Tajikistan)\n\n0x429 Persian (Iran)\n\n0x42A Vietnamese (Vietnam)\n\n0x42B Armenian (Armenia)\n\n0x42C Azerbaijani (Latin, Azerbaijan)\n\n0x42D Basque (Basque)\n\n0x42E Upper Sorbian (Germany)\n\n0x42F Macedonian (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\n\n0x430 Southern Sotho (South Africa)\n\n0x431 Tsonga (South Africa)\n\n0x432 Setswana (South Africa)\n\n\n-----\n\n0x433 Venda (South Africa)\n\n0x434 isiXhosa (South Africa)\n\n0x435 isiZulu (South Africa)\n\n0x436 Afrikaans (South Africa)\n\n0x437 Georgian (Georgia)\n\n0x438 Faroese (Faroe Islands)\n\n0x439 Hindi (India)\n\n0x43A Maltese (Malta)\n\n0x43B Sami, Northern (Norway)\n\n0x43D Yiddish (World)\n\n0x43E Malay (Malaysia)\n\n0x43F Kazakh (Kazakhstan)\n\n0x440 Kyrgyz (Kyrgyzstan)\n\n0x441 Kiswahili (Kenya)\n\n0x442 Turkmen (Turkmenistan)\n\n0x443 Uzbek (Latin, Uzbekistan)\n\n0x444 Tatar (Russia)\n\n## Similarities to Tycoon\n\n[Mandiant compared elements of ROLLCOAST to elements of Tycoon ransomware and found some similarities:](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/06/threat-spotlight-tycoon-ransomware-targets-education-and-software-sectors)\n\nBoth ransomware families encrypt files using AES in GCM mode\nOverlap between the ignored directories, files, and extensions including the ignored extension “.lolz”.\n\nThis suggests the developers modelled ROLLCOAST on, or copied elements from, Tycoon ransomware. ROLLCOAST and TYCOON differ in\ntheir overall implementations: TYCOON is a Java based ransomware whereas ROLLCOAST is not. In addition, there is functionality in the\npublicly reported TYCOON that ROLLCOAST does not appear to have (shell commands, backup tampering, firewall tampering, wmic).\n\n## ROLLCOAST Strings\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nFOUND DEVICE:\n\n```\n```\nStart encryption of %s\n\n```\n```\n[-] Failed to init dir traverse for: %s\n\n```\n```\nFinished encryption of %s\n\n```\n```\nWork out other countries.

In [Mandiant’s 2021 Trends and 2022 Predictions report, ransomware data theft operations affecting](https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/21-00020026)\nhealthcare are noted as having increased from January 2020 to June 2021, despite some groups claiming they would avoid targeting\nhospitals. UNC2190 has continued to operate over the past year while making only minor changes to their strategies and tooling, including the\nintroduction of a commercial packer and the rebranding of their service offering. This highlights how well-known tools, such as BEACON, can\nlead to impactful and lucrative incidents even when leveraged by lesser-known groups.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWith thanks Joshua Shilko for analytical contributions, Barry Vengerik, Tufail Ahmed, Isif Ibrahima, Andrew Thompson, Jake Nicastro, Nick\nRichard, and Moritz Raabe for technical review, and all the Mandiant Researchers, Consultants, Advanced Practices External Collectors, and\nFLARE REs for support, research, and assistance to create the content of this post.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK\n\nMandiant has observed UNC2190 use the following techniques:\n\n**ATT&CK Tactic Category** **Techniques**\n\nDiscovery T1016:    System Network Configuration Discovery\n\nT1057:    Process Discovery\n\nT1083:    File and Directory Discovery\n\nT1518:    Software Discovery\n\nImpact T1486:    Data Encrypted for Impact\n\n\n-----\n\nDiscovery T1016:    System Network Configuration Discovery\n\nT1057:    Process Discovery\n\nT1083:    File and Directory Discovery\n\nT1518:    Software Discovery\n\nDefense Evasion T1027:    Obfuscated Files or Information\n\nT1027.002:  Software Packing\n\nT1055:    Process Injection\n\nT1497:    Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion\n\nT1497.001:  System Checks\n\nT1564.003:  Hidden Window\n\nPersistence T1136:    Create Account\n\nCommand and Control T1071.001:  Web Protocols\n\nT1573.002:  Asymmetric Cryptography\n\nResource Development T1587.003:  Digital Certificates\n\nT1608.003:  Install Digital Certificate\n\nExecution T1059.001:  PowerShell\n\n## Yara Signatures\n\n_Note: FE_Hunting rules are designed to broadly capture suspicious files and are not designed to detect a particular malware or threat._\n```\n rule FE_Hunting_THEMIDA_strings_FEBeta\n\n```\n```\n{\n  meta:\n\n```\n```\n    author = \"Mandiant\"\n    date_created = \"2021-10-26\"\n\n```\n```\n    date_modified = \"2021-10-26\"\n    md5 = \"7669f00b467e2990be182584b341c0e8\"\n\n```\n```\n    rev = 2\n    sid = 415583\n\n```\n```\n  strings:\n    $themida = \".themida\" nocase\n\n```\n```\n  condition:\n    uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and filesize < 20MB and (@themida[1] < 1024)\n\n```\n\n}\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule FE_Ransomware_Win64_ROLLCOAST_1\n{\n\n```\n```\n  meta:\n    author = \"Mandiant\"\n\n```\n```\n    date_created = \"2020-07-15\"\n    date_modified = \"2020-07-15\"\n\n```\n```\n    md5 = \"45882426ecddb032981fd6c299b3cc47\"\n    rev = 2\n\n```\n```\n  strings:\n    $sb1 = { 48 8D [5] 48 8D ?? 24 ??
