Introduction\n\n**Bank robbery is perhaps the quintessential crime. The promise of immense, instant riches has lured**\n**many a criminal to target banks. And while the methods, tools, and scale of robbery have all changed,**\n**two things have stayed the same: the enticement of a hefty payday and the fact that no system is**\n**perfectly secure.**\n\n**In the modern digital economy, criminals are becoming ever more creative in ways to make off with**\n**millions without having to leave home. Despite enormous efforts, security is always a work in progress**\n**because of technical vulnerabilities and the human factor. Only a small fraction of banks today are able**\n**to withstand targeted attacks of the kind perpetrated by Cobalt, a cybercriminal group first described in�**\n**2016 that is currently active worldwide. Now the group has set its sights on more than just banks.**\n\n**[Researchers at Positive Technologies and other companies have described the group's methods](https://www.group-ib.com/cobalt.html)**\n**previously. In this report, we will describe the new techniques used by Cobalt in 2017, the changing**\n**target profile, and recommendations on how to avoid becoming their latest victim.�**\n\n### 2. Executive summary\n\n**The Cobalt group has been quick to react to banks' protective measures. When spam filters on mail�**\n**servers began to block most of the group's phishing emails, which contained forged sender**\n**[information, the attackers changed techniques. Now they actively use Supply Chain Attacks to](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/analyst/combatting-cyber-risks-supply-chain-36252)**\n**leverage the infrastructure and accounts of actual employees at one company, in order to forge**\n**convincing emails targeting a different partner organization. This tactic has already been used by other**\n**attackers, such as when the infrastructure of M.E.Doc was used to spread the NotPetya virus, which**\n**[blocked workstations at a large number of major companies.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/30/telebots-back-supply-chain-attacks-against-ukraine/)**\n\n**Cobalt has attacked banks, financial exchanges, insurance companies, investment funds, and other�**\n**financial organizations. The group is not afraid to use the names of regulatory authorities or security�**\n**topics to trick recipients into opening phishing messages from illegitimate domains.**\n\n**Here is some of the latest information about techniques used by the Cobalt group:**\n\n**Active attacks on bank partners in order to use partner infrastructure for sending phishing**\n**messages to banks.**\n\n**Phishing messages disguised as mailings from financial regulators.�**\n\n**Various types of malicious attachments: document with an exploit (.doc, .xls, .rtf), archive**\n**with an executable dropper file (.scr, .exe), and archive with LNK file (.lnk).�**\n\n**Among the first groups to get access to the latest version of the Microsoft Word Intruder 8�**\n**exploit builder, which made it possible to create documents exploiting vulnerability CVE-**\n**2017-0199.**\n\n**Poorly protected public sites are used to upload files and then download them to victim�**\n**computers.**\n\n**Phishing messages are sent both to corporate addresses and personal addresses of**\n**employees.**\n\n### 3.

Cobalt targets and objectives\n\n**The Cobalt group's traditional \"stomping grounds\" are the Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and**\n**Southeast Asia. In 2017, attacks grew to include North America, Western Europe, and even South**\n**America (Argentina).**\n\n**Of the companies targeted by Cobalt in phishing mailings, around 75 percent are in the financial�**\n**sector. Most of these financial companies are banks (90%), but others include financial exchanges,�**\n**investment funds, and lenders. This widening range of targets suggests that attacks on diverse**\n**companies with major financial flows are underway. This concurs with the forecast made by the�**\n**FinCERT of the Russian Central Bank, which predicted increased interest by cybercriminals in financial�**\n**exchanges in 2017.**\n\n**By attacking a financial exchange, the Cobalt group can \"pump\" or \"dump\" stocks, incentivizing�**\n**purchase or sale of shares in certain companies in a way that causes rapid fluctuations in share price.�**\n**Stock manipulation can affect not just the welfare of a single company, but the economy of entire**\n**countries. These methods were employed by the Corkow group in their 2016 attack on Russia's**\n**Energobank, which caused a 15-percent change in the exchange rate of the ruble and caused bank**\n**[losses of RUB 244 million (over USD 4 million).](http://fortune.com/2016/02/08/russian-hackers-currency-rate/)**\n\n**The remaining 25 percent of targeted companies represent diverse industries:**\n\n**Government**\n\n**Telecom/Internet**\n\n**Service Providers**\n\n**Manufacturing**\n\n\n-----\n\n**g** **g** **q** **p** **p** **g**\n**messages sent as part of Cobalt campaigns. These messages were sent to over 3,000 people in 12**\n**countries. The addresses include corporate addresses but also personal addresses, since employees**\n**often can check their email on work computers.**\n\n**Notably, Cobalt attacks government organizations and ministries in order to use them as a stepping**\n**stone for other targets.**\n\n### 5. Chronology of Cobalt 2017 campaign\n\n**In early 2017, we noted that the Cobalt group was actively registering illegitimate domains. As soon as**\n**these domains were used to send phishing mailings, we notified the security departments of the�**\n**targeted companies, as well as the FinCERT of the Russian Central Bank. Thanks to this timely**\n**intervention, the domains were blocked before the attackers could make use of them.**\n\n**Positive Technologies has investigated incidents related to attacks by the Cobalt group at a number of**\n**companies in 2017. In several cases, the attackers compromised company infrastructure and**\n**employee accounts in order to send phishing messages to partner companies (i.e., companies that**\n**have a legitimate pre-existing business relationship with banks) in North and South America, Europe,**\n**CIS countries, and Central and Southeast Asia. Against targets in the CIS countries, the attackers also**\n**used their own infrastructure, which included rented dedicated servers located in North America,**\n**Europe, and Southeast Asia.**\n\n**Several pieces of information suggest that the team responsible for the technical aspects of attacks**\n**consists of only a handful of people. When the attackers were at their most active inside target**\n**networks, the group would temporarily stop registering domain names and sending phishing mailings.**\n**Activity not aimed at the targeted infrastructure was not detected The days and times of mailings are**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The Cobalt group relies on social engineering to penetrate networks—users open malicious**\n**attachments from phishing messages that are disguised by the attackers to resemble messages from**\n**legitimate companies and regulatory authorities. These attachments contain a document file, which�**\n**downloads a dropper from a remote server or contains the dropper in a password-protected archive.**\n**Small in size, a dropper is used to download and run other malicious software (in the case of Cobalt,**\n**the Beacon Trojan).**\n\n**Preparations and progression of a typical attack are illustrated below.**\n\n**For information on the actions of Cobalt attackers inside the network of a targeted organization, please**\n**[see our previous report.](https://www.ptsecurity.com/upload/corporate/ww-en/analytics/Cobalt-Snatch-eng.pdf)**\n\n#### 1. Partner phishing\n\n**The Cobalt group's traditional method—sending messages with forged sender information—has fallen**\n**out of favor. Instead, the group has paid more attention to making sure that messages get delivered by**\n**dodging mail server filters. �**\n\n**For a targeted mailing (\"spear phishing\"), the criminals use previously registered domains. A domain**\n**name is chosen to be similar in meaning and spelling to the domain of the real company. For**\n**messages to make it through antispam and antivirus checks, the criminals correctly configure SPF�**\n**entries on the DNS server and indicate the correct DKIM signatures for their messages. This approach**\n**allows bypassing verification of the address of the sender's mail server, but offers digital evidence for�**\n**investigators.**\n\n**Despite the increased complexity involved, in the first quarter of 2017 the Cobalt group also began to�**\n**attack various companies that partner with banks, then sending phishing messages from these**\n**partners' infrastructures using the hacked accounts and mail servers of real employees.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**This approach ensures that recipients are likely to trust the sender and has a number of advantages:**\n\n**1. Attackers get information stored on the servers and in the databases of the compromised**\n\n**partner organization. This information can be used to create convincing phishing messages.**\n\n**2. Attackers obtain access to employee accounts on workstations and mail servers, giving phishing**\n\n**messages a high degree of trust and plausibility among potential recipients.**\n\n**3. Messages from partners are not blocked by mail server filters.�**\n\n**The attackers carefully choose subject lines, recipient addresses, and attachment names**\n**that will \"fly below the radar\" so that recipients open the attachments enclosed with�**\n**phishing messages.**\n\n**Today, Cobalt uses phishing mailings at practically all stages of targeted attacks on banks.**\n\n**1. Initial compromise starts with one or more workstations at a partner organization, which have been**\n**infected via phishing.**\n\n**_A message informing of \"missed payments\"_**\n\n**_Instructions for connecting to a payment gateway—supposedly_**\n\n**2. The attack against the partner organization is then developed by means of internal mailings**\n**containing malicious documents supposedly from colleagues, management, or IT.**\n\n**_\"Documents requested by the head of the department\"_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_A message claiming to inform of payroll changes_**\n\n**3. Malicious messages are sent from the partner's infrastructure to banks and other financial�**\n**organizations.**\n\n**_A password-protected archive (with the password \"doc\") supposedly containing an invoice for ATM_**\n\n**_maintenance_**\n\n**In early 2017, 60 percent of phishing messages from Cobalt related to cooperation and service terms**\n**between banks and their partners.**\n\n**In 2017 Cobalt began to use security anxieties as an attack vector. The group has sent messages from**\n**illegitimate domains posing as VISA, MasterCard, and FinCERT units of the Russian Central Bank and**\n**National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan.**\n\n**Broken English and copied boilerplate text can be convincing in the right circumstances**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_A fake FinCERT message_**\n\n**In Russia, this was a particularly ironic \"twist\" since FinCERT had been actively warning financial�**\n**companies about the Cobalt threat. So the group took advantage of such anxiety to send messages to**\n**banks with malicious documents, supposedly on how to keep bank systems safe**\n\n**_A vague warning that asks the user to act immediately_**\n\n**So by creating counterfeit domains superficially similar to those of real companies, the criminals use�**\n**the imprimatur of well-known organizations to convince users to open dangerous attachments.**\n\n**Since real messages from colleagues and partners usually arrive during working hours, the criminals**\n**structured the mailings so that employees would receive them during working hours (no matter in**\n**which time zone the attackers themselves were located).**\n\n**Most messages were received in the afternoon—the reason being that employees tend to be less**\n**vigilant, and therefore more susceptible to phishing, as the evening approaches.**\n\n**We noticed a slight variation in tactics against North American companies. Messages targeting U.S.**\n**and Canadian organizations were sent from the compromised infrastructure of a European partner. For**\n**the phishing messages to be plausibly European in origin, the criminals performed the mailing during**\n**European working hours, due to which the targets received emails in the early waking hours in the**\n**U.S. and Canada.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**software Cobalt Strike.**\n\n**The Trojan is delivered and run with the help of a special dropper. The dropper consists of .scr or .exe**\n**files that are placed on the victim's computer in one of the following ways:�**\n\n**1. In a password-protected ZIP archive, the password to which is given in the text of the phishing**\n\n**message.**\n\n**2. Downloaded from a hacked website when a malicious attachment (.doc, .xls, .rtf) is opened from**\n\n**the phishing message.**\n\n**3. Downloaded from a hacked website based on commands coded in a LNK file that is in a ZIP�**\n\n**archive attached to the message.**\n\n**Poorly protected websites are compromised by the attackers and used, in essence, as file�**\n**hosts for spreading malicious files in attacks against banks.�**\n\n**52 percent of the Cobalt phishing messages reviewed by our researchers contained Microsoft Word**\n**documents.**\n\n**The malicious Microsoft Office documents that trigger download of the dropper are created using the�**\n**Ancalog and Microsoft Word Intruder (MWI) exploit kits. With these kits, even a hacker without**\n**programming skills can create malicious Word documents and PDF files in an intuitive visual interface�**\n**in just minutes.**\n\n**The Cobalt group was one of the first to get their hands on a restricted version of MWI that can create�**\n**documents exploiting the critical vulnerability CVE-2017-0199. Since the version in question was sold**\n**on an individual basis to customers well known to the developer, there may be a relationship between**\n**the Cobalt group and developer of MWI. One instructive fact in this regard is that less than a week**\n**passed between announcement of a new MWI version and use by Cobalt of attachments exploiting**\n**[vulnerability CVE-2017-0199.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/microsoft-word-intruder-integrates-cve-2017-0199-utilized-cobalt-group-target)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**MWI is positioned by its developer as a tool for performing APT attacks; if the software is instead used**\n**to create files for mass spamming, the developer revokes the license. For users of the restricted�**\n**version of MWI, the developer offers a sort of \"scrubbing\" so that files will not be flagged by currently�**\n**available antivirus scanners.**\n\n**_The MWI developer boasting of the \"product\" online_**\n\n**Malicious documents sent by Cobalt to banks and their partners use exploits for**\n**vulnerabilities CVE-2017-0199, CVE-2015-1641, and CVE-2012-0158 in order to**\n**download and run the dropper on the victim system.**\n\n**_An official-seeming document about how to pay overdue debts�_**\n\n**When the attachment is opened, malicious code is run. This code takes advantage of vulnerabilities in**\n**[Microsoft Office to download the dropper from a remote server and �run it. After the code finishes�](https://blog.fortinet.com/2017/05/30/spear-phishing-fileless-attack-with-cve-2017-0199)**\n**running, a decoy document (such as shown in the screenshot) is displayed.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**the site or law enforcement may seize server equipment as part of a criminal investigation. Public**\n**knowledge of such incidents is likely to cause severe damage to company reputation.**\n\n**Usually Cobalt phishing messages are sent in several waves. In the first wave, the criminals send�**\n**Microsoft Office documents created using the described exploit kits.�**\n\n**If there are no \"hits\" from targeted users within 24 hours of a mailing (this is possible if a company has**\n**up-to-date versions of Microsoft Office that are free of the vulnerabilities targeted by the exploit�**\n**builders), the attackers send a second wave.**\n\n**Attached to the messages is a dropper, consisting of .exe or .scr executable files, in a password-�**\n**protected archive. By placing the files in an archive, the attackers can bypass some filtering and�**\n**antivirus systems. Solutions are available for real-time scanning of encrypted archives (when the**\n**password is indicated in the body of the message, as is the case here) but organizations making use**\n**of such software are few and far between.**\n\n**In addition, we have observed a separate mailing in which the attached archives contained LNK files;�**\n**as in all the other cases, these files are used to download the Beacon dropper. �**\n\n#### 3. Cobalt infrastructure\n\n**Since a Cobalt mailing is sent to thousands of recipients, the group clearly is using some sort of**\n**automation. Based on analysis of the phishing messages, we believe that the messages are sent from**\n**[phishing domains with the help of alexusMailer v2.0, a freely available PHP script used to send emails](https://github.com/AlexusBlack)**\n**anonymously.**\n\n**_alexusMailer and other scripts are available on forums_**\n\n**The script includes support for multithreaded sending, a visual editor for messages, import of recipient**\n**lists and other fields from files, templates, attaching any number of files to a message, and more.�**\n**Users can distribute sending tasks over a number of servers and set a delay for message sending.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_alexusMailer interface_**\n\n**However, when messages are sent with alexusMailer, the message header contains an artifact: the X-**\n**PHP-Originating-Script field contains the name of the file of the PHP script that was used to send the�**\n**messages. This means that on servers used for sending, the php.ini configuration file is set to log�**\n**outgoing mail.**\n\n**The Cobalt group uses widely availably public mail services, as well as services that allow anonymous**\n**registration of temporary addresses. Some of the domains used for reply addresses in Cobalt mailings**\n**include: TempMail (@doanart.com, @rootfest.net), Mail.com (@mail.com), AT&T Mail (@att.net,**\n**@sbcglobal.net), and Yahoo! (@ymail.com). These same services were used by Cobalt to create**\n**email addresses when registering domains.**\n\n**Based on the times at which the domains in the Cobalt infrastructure were registered, we found that**\n**the attackers tended to register domains towards the beginning of the week. This enables us to**\n**speculate on their working schedule:**\n\n**− On weekdays, the attackers actively register domains, prepare hacking tools, and (less**\n**often) send phishing mailings.**\n\n**− At the end of the week, the group concentrates on sending out mailings and advancing**\n**their attacks within the infrastructure of compromised organizations.**\n\n**− Since phishing mailings are sent out during working hours, domains are usually**\n**registered during the interval from 6:00 PM to 12:00 AM (UTC+0), which coincides with the**\n**end of the working day in European countries.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**It would seem that after registering a domain at the beginning of the week, the Cobalt group takes**\n**some time to prepare for their upcoming phishing campaign, which as noted usually comes at the end**\n**of the week. On average, the time from domain registration to the first phishing mailing with that same�**\n**domain is four days.**\n\n**Our researchers discovered a number of Cobalt phishing domains before the group was able to use**\n**them in its phishing campaigns. By acting quickly, it was possible to block the domains.**\n\n**Working in cooperation with industry regulators in Russia and other countries, we have succeeded in**\n**disabling delegation for all .ru domains and most other top-level domains known to be associated with**\n**Cobalt.**\n\n### 7. Conclusion\n\n**The barrier to entry for would-be cybercriminals keeps falling every year. No longer do hackers need to**\n**look for zero-day vulnerabilities and expensive tools to perform attacks. Instead, all they require are**\n**basic programming skills, commercially available software, and instructions posted on the Internet.**\n\n**Banks and other companies must realize that attackers are constantly refining the tools and�**\n**techniques they use. In today's environment, a company can fall victim just by getting caught in the**\n**middle as attackers scout for stepping stones to reach their ultimate target. That's why responsible**\n**companies can no longer remain complacent about security and pretend that hackers go after only**\n**large companies and banks, or target only far-away areas of the world. No matter their industry or**\n**ownership—whether banks, state-owned organizations, or whatever else—companies must keep**\n**protection of their digital infrastructure current and proactively update their software and operating**\n**systems. Employees must be trained to increase their security awareness and resist phishing**\n**attempts. Moreover, scanning should go beyond just incoming messages and attachments to include**\n**outgoing messages, with retrospective analysis. Public-facing web applications must also be protected**\n**—if company infrastructure or sites are compromised by an attacker, this can wound company**\n**reputation, cause blocking of company servers, trigger a drop in search engine ratings, and drive away**\n**customers.**\n\n**Information about the extent of losses caused by the Cobalt group in 2017 is not yet available.**\n**Perhaps warnings by bank regulators headed off some of the group's efforts. We will continue to**\n**monitor the Cobalt group and report new details as they become available. Judging by the scale of**\n**Cobalt campaigns worldwide, multimillion-dollar losses by banks are a real possibility. And if attacks on**\n**financial exchanges are successful, the consequences will include not only direct losses to individual�**\n**companies, but rate turbulence on world currency markets.**\n\n**[Author Positive Research at 1:00 AM](https://www.blogger.com/profile/12273696227623127095)**\n\n**[Tags Cobalt, hacks, research](http://blog.ptsecurity.com/search/label/Cobalt)**\n\n## No comments:\n\n Post a Comment\n\n**Enter your comment...**\n\n**Comment as:** **[Select profile...]**\n\n**PublishPublish** **PreviewPreview**\n\n**[Home](http://blog.ptsecurity.com/)** **[Older Post](http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2017/07/recovering-data-from-disk-encrypted-by.html)**\n\n**[Subscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)](http://blog.ptsecurity.com/feeds/8115373785289763196/comments/default)**\n\n\n**Enter your comment...**\n\n\n**PublishPublish**\n\n\n-----",
