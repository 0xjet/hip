As with HenBox, Farseer also has infrastructure ties to other\nmalware, such as Poison Ivy and Zupdax.\n\nWe named this malware Farseer malware due to a string found in the PDB path embedded within the executable files. For example:\n\ne:\\WorkSpace\\A1\\coding\\Farseer\\RemoteShellsRemote\\Release\\RemoteShellsRemote.pdb.\n\nTracking-back, we’ve seen over 30 unique samples throughout the past two and half years, with the majority in 2017 and a handful in 2018, the\nmost recent of which were seen, at least from our visibility, during the last two months indicating a relatively low-volume yet\nsteady flow of Farseer samples. Figure 1 below shows the trend of malicious sessions for these samples according to AutoFocus.\n\n_Figure 1 AutoFocus session trends for Farseer samples over time_\n\n### Ties to HenBox Android Malware et al\n\nAs previously mentioned, there are ties between Farseer, HenBox, PlugX, Zupdax, 9002, and Poison Ivy malware families. The infrastructure\nused by the combination of malware families is pretty vast, with plenty of overlaps, however in this blog we focus only on some of the\ncore ties captured in the green rectangle, as shown in Figure 2 below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Maltego chart showing overlaps between Farseer and related threats_\n\nFigure 2 shows a high-level representation of file hashes, IP addresses, and domain names used by some of the various malware families\nalready mentioned, together with their overlaps. Farseer has the largest number of samples in Figure 2 but that’s skewed given the focus of\nthis blog.\n\nThe green rectangle shows some of the core overlaps between the aforementioned families, which we will discuss in more detail now.\n\nThe most recent (at the point of publishing) Farseer sample (SHA256: 271E29FE… detailed in Table 2 below) introduced a new C2 domain –\ntcpdo[.]net – into the Farseer set, as shown in Figure 3 below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Maltego diagram showing tcpdo[.]net and other Farseer / PoisonIvy overlaps._\n\nFigure 3 shows how this new (to Farseer) domain relates both directly to said Farseer sample and indirectly, through third-level domains and\nIP addresses, to other Farseer samples; a handful of Poison Ivy samples have also used this domain as their C2,\nmostly before this Farseer sample – as early as mid-2015 – but also more recently, one month after, on December 17th, 2018 indicating it’s a\ndomain in fairly active use. Third-level domains of tcpdo[.]net, together with all other indicators are listed at the end of this blog.\n\nThe overlaps between Farseer and Poison Ivy don’t end with tcpdo[.]net. Much like with HenBox,\nother infrastructure ties exist: directly through sony36[.]com and md.son36[.]com; indirectly through third-level domains of tcpdo[.]net and IP\naddresses 45.32.251[.]7 and 45.32.53[.]250.\n\nFarseer also overlaps with HenBox and PlugX samples through multiple C2 domains and IP address resolutions:\n\nouthmail[.]com (and third-levels of this domain)\ncdncool[.]com (and third-levels of this domain)\nwww3.mefound[.]com\nw3.changeip[.]org\nwww5.zyns[.]com\n45.32.53[.]250\n45.32.44[.]52\n45.32.45[.]77\n59.188.196[.]162\n59.188.196[.]172\n\n[Domain outhmail[.]com was documented as part of research into a 9002 Trojan delivered through Google Drive back in 2016 further expanding](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-attack-delivers-9002-trojan-through-google-drive/)\nthe capabilities of this group and its tools.\n\n### Ghost Dragon Overlaps \n\nBefore we detail the Farseer malware itself, it’s worth noting another overlap we encountered during this research. Third-level\ndomain 3w.tcpdo[.]net, as shown towards the bottom of Figure 4 below, resolved to IP 175.45.192[.]234 in 2015. This IP address relates to\n[domains and custom Gh0st RAT malware samples, some of which are documented in this Ghost Dragon campaign report. Considering the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gh0st_RAT)\ntime that’s passed since this publication, it’s harder to investigate how strong the ties are, however, the two domains used\n\n\n-----\n\nby o so y ( d5c[ ] et) a d a see (3 tcpdo[ ] et) a e eso ed to t at add ess o e ece t y t a docu e ted t e G ost ago\nreport. Specifically, June 2015, and between July and August 2015, respectively for Poison Ivy and Farseer; these two domains and five others\n\n- adminloader[.]com, csip6[.]biz, cdncool[.]com, linkdatax[.]com and adminsysteminfo[.]com - have a common registrant, 46313@QQ[.]COM\nbut no such commonality exists within the set of known Ghost Dragon domains.\n\nIt’s possible the infrastructure relates to the same group, or multiple groups, conducting various attacks against different operating\nsystems using the various malware families described in this, and related, reports. The possible ties require further investigation.\n\n_Figure 4 Maltego chart showing overlaps to Ghost Dragon campaign_\n\n\n-----\n\n### C Se e St uctu e\n\n[As previously mentioned in the first HenBox blog, a common registrant registered seven known domains, four of which had malicious activity](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-henbox-chickens-come-home-roost/)\nrelated to Poison Ivy and Zupdax malware families. Interestingly, all of the domains share at least one third-level domain in common, perhaps\nindicating a template being used for the infrastructure setup or based on the requirements of the malware’s C2 communication. Table 1 below\nlists the commonalities, aside from other domains such as www, mail and dns.\n\n**Domain / Third-level Domain** **info.** **re.** **update.** **up.**\n\ntcpdo[.]net\n\nadminsysteminfo[.]com\n\nmd5c[.]net\n\nlinkdatax[.]com\n\ncsip6[.]biz\n\nadminloader[.]com\n\ncdncool[.]com\n\nnewfacebk[.]com\n\n_Table 1 Common third-level domain names_\n\n### Farseer Malware\n\nNow that we have introduced Farseer, and how it relates to other known malware families, let’s dive into how the malware\nworks. This section aims to provide a description of the general behavior for this malware based on a small subset of total set of samples; a\nmore detailed description exists in the technical appendix.\n\nFigure 5, below, describes at a high-level the post-installation execution flow of a typical Farseer sample.\n\n_Figure 5 Farseer Execution Flow_\n\nFarseer employs the known technique of DLL sideloading - the use of trusted binaries to load malicious code – to load its\npayload, see Figure 5. To achieve this, the malware begins by dropping known, legitimate, signed binaries to the host. These binaries, signed\nby Microsoft or other vendors, are typically trusted applications when checked by antivirus software or the operating system and thus do\nnot raise any suspicious alerts. Figure 6 below shows the import library list for both the benign PE files highlighting how the nested imports\nwork to ultimately load sys.dll – the malicious payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 bscmake.exe importing mspdb80.dll importing Farseer's sys.dll_\n\nThe payload on disk is an encrypted and compressed file that most antivirus software will not flag as malicious since the underlying code\nis hidden. More information about how the decompression and decryption can be found in the appendix.\n\nOnce sys.dll is running, it locates a file named stub.bin located in the same folder, and in-turn loads the Farseer config file, sys.dat, on disk.\nThe config relates to C2 communications, amongst other things.\n\nThe following two code excerpts show the obfuscated and deobfuscated versions of this variant’s configuration file. The obfuscation routine\nused in this case – and many others – is simply ASCII encoding where characters are replaced with their ASCII value; other variants have\nused stronger, custom encryption algorithms to hide configuration data. Details are in the appendix.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n\n\n\n[StudentInfo]\n\np1=117,112,46,111,117,116,104,109,97,105,108,46,99,111,109,\np2=56,48,\n\np4=116,101,115,116,45,48,52,45,49,49,\n\np5=67,58,92,85,115,101,114,115,92,65,68,77,73,78,73,126,49,46,87,73,78,92,65,112,112,68,97,116,97,92,76,111,99,97,108,92,84,101,109,\n\np1=up.outhmail[.]com\n\np2=80\n\np4=test-04-11\n\np5=C:\\Users\\[<i>username</i>]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\main.exe\n\n\nThe line items in the second code excerpt above are represented as follows:\n\np1 relates to the C2 FQDN;\np2 is the TCP port used for C2 – many variants use non-standard TCP ports;\np3 is missing;\np4 appears to be a version string of some sort, which is sent as part of the C2 communication – other variants have used strings, such as\n“mark”;\np5 is the full file path from where the malware was launched.\n\n[Farseer config files share some similarities with those of HenBox, as documented here and shown in Figure 7 below for convenience.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-henbox-inside-coop/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 Screenshot of HenBox configuration file, setting.txt_\n\nBoth are text files, read and parsed at run-time; more often than not, the ASCII data is obfuscated using encoding methods of varying\nsophistication. Perhaps the most notable similarity is the notation of the content, which in both malware families:\n\nis delimited by an ‘=’ equals character;\nuses a single character followed by a single digit starting from 1 to begin each line;\nhas the C2 host/FQDN on the first line;\nhas the TCP port to use to connect the C2 on the second line;\n\nFor persistence on the host, the Farseer malware creates a registry entry named sys under:\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\nThe entry runs the VBS script slmgr.vbs shown below, which executes bscmake.exe, and thus Farseer, each time a user logs on to their PC.\n\ncreateobject(\"wscript.shell\").run \"C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\windows\\bscmake.exe\"\n\nOne of the earliest Farseer samples Unit 42 analysed also used a decoy PDF document during execution. The PDF content included\na copied news article from a Myanmar website that reports on news in the Southeast Asia region. The file properties of said PDF, as shown\nbelow, describe the language setting of the application that created it, together with the creation date – eight days prior to\nthe Farseer sample that used the document.\n\nLanguage   : zh-CN\n\nAuthor    : Administrator\n\nCreator   : Microsoft® Word 2013\n\nCreate Date : 2016:04:11 11:06:30+08:00\n\nModify Date : 2016:04:11 11:06:30+08:00\n\nMore information about this variant of Farseer, and the decoy PDF, can be found in the appendix section.\n\n### Targeting\n\nIn this case, we do not have great visibility into the targets of the Farseer malware. However, given our existing knowledge based\non [previous](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/9002-trojan/) [research, and around malware with closely-related](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/plugx/) [infrastructure, together with certain targeting themes seen in](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/poison-ivy/)\nsome Farseer samples, it is highly likely that victims lay in and around the South East Asia region.\n\n### ATT&CK Techniques Observed\n\nID Technique\n\n[T1140](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140/) Deobfuscate / Decode Files or Information\n\n[T1071](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/) Standard Application Layer Protocol\n\n[T1060](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1060/) Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder\n\n\n-----\n\n[T1045](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1045/) Software Packing\n\n[T1073](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1073/) DLL Side-Loading\n\n[T1065](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1065/) Uncommonly Used Port\n\n[T1043](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1043/) Commonly Used Port\n\n[T1328](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1328/) Buy domain name\n\n[T1319](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1319/) Obfuscate or encrypt code\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe threat actors behind Farseer, and related malware including HenBox, continue to grow their armoury with the addition of this previouslyunknown malware family. The overlapping infrastructure, shared TTPs and similarities in malicious code and configurations highlights the web\nof threats used to target victims in and around the South East Asia region and perhaps beyond.\n\nFarseer payloads are backdoors that beacon to pre-configured C2 servers for instructions. The malware uses various techniques\nto evade detection and inhibit analysis. For example, DLL sideloading using trusted, signed executables allows the malware to execute rather\nseamlessly; some payloads are encrypted on disk preventing analysis, especially as decompression and decryption occurs at runtime, inmemory, where code is further altered to thwart forensic analysis.\n\nWhereas HenBox posed a threat for devices running Android, Farseer is built to target Windows, which appears to be more typical\ngiven previous threats seen from the group or groups behind this, and related malware.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are already protected via:\n\nAll samples in this report have a malicious verdict in WildFire.\nTraps advanced endpoint protection detects Farseer malware.\nDomains have been classified as malicious.\n[AutoFocus tags are available for additional context: Farseer.](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Farseer)\n\nUpdate 18th September 2019: This blog has changed to remove two references to PKPLUG as a malware family.\n\n## Appendix\n\nThe technical analysis of Farseer malware is described in this section. Table 2 below lists the samples we have chosen for our investigation.\nThe list includes a couple of recent samples and the first Farseer sample seen, according to our data, to highlight key differences in the threat’s\nevolution.\n\n# **SHA256** **First Seen (Pacific Time)** **Key Indicator / Domain**\n\n\n1 271E29FE8E23901184377AB5D0D12B40\nD485F8C404AEF0BDCC4A4148CCBB1A1A\n\n2 4AB41A025624F342DEB85D798C6D6264\nA9FB88B8B3D9037CF8D5248A9F730339\n\n3 9E08EFC73DC9145358898D2735C5F31D\n45A2571663C7F4963ABD217AE979C7CA\n\n_Table 2 Samples discussed in this blog_\n\n\n11/17/2018 10:11:16 pm tcpdo[.]net:158\n\n\n04/02/2018\n7:18:07 pm\n\n04/19/2016\n6:26:15 pm\n\n\nhonor2020[.]ga:993\n\nouthmail[.]com:80\n\n\nFarseer employs the known technique of DLL sideloading - the use of trusted binaries to load malicious code – to load its payload,\nsee Figure 5. To achieve this, the malware begins by dropping known, legitimate, signed binaries to the host. These binaries, signed by\nMicrosoft or other vendors, are typically trusted applications when checked by antivirus software or the operating system and thus do not raise\nany suspicious alerts. This technique takes advantage of the Windows search order for loading dependencies when a program launches. By\ndefault, the Windows loader will first look for any dependency files of the executable in its current working directory. If found, the executable will\nthen load them into memory. With this in mind, the actors place their malicious DLL’s in the same directory as the signed executable that was\ndropped on disk. By naming them as dependency files of that executable, the malicious code will run whenever the executable is started.\n\nNow that the actor has found a way to execute malicious code on the host, they use it to load their final payload, which contains the core\nfunctionality of the Farseer malware. The payload on disk is an encrypted and compressed file that most antivirus software will not flag as\nmalicious since the underlying code is hidden. To avoid detection from users and blend with the Windows file system, the\npayload files themselves have innocuous or common Windows file names and extensions.\n\n\n-----\n\neco p ess o a d dec ypt o o t e pay oad occu s o y at u t e, e o y, a d t e e o y code s a te ed to t a t o e s c\nanalysis. This is achieved by deconstructing the import address table (IAT) and resolving necessary API calls manually versus relying on the\nWindows loader. In addition, it further avoids IAT reconstruction by using what is known as stolen code technique, wherein some of the\ninstructions in the beginning of an API subroutine are emulated somewhere else in an allocated memory region. This can cause unexpected\nresults during memory analysis as the IAT API’s cannot be resolved. We determined that the in-memory payloads are backdoors that beacon\nto a pre-configured command and control server (C2) for instructions.\n\nFirst, bscmake.exe runs and imports mspdb80.dll, one of its dependency files. Bscmake.exe is an older Microsoft executable that is part of\nVisual Studio. When mspdb80.dll is loaded, it will import its dependency files, one of which is sys.dll. It should be stated that both bscmake.exe\nand mspdb80.dll are known, trusted files signed by Microsoft Corporation and have not been modified. Sys.dll however is the Farseer malware\nand is responsible for loading the encrypted file stub.bin file in-memory and begins code execution.\n\n_Figure 8 Sys.dll loading stub.bin_\n\nFigure 8 illustrates the connection between sys.dll and stub.bin. When sys.dll is loaded it will look for stub.bin in the current working directory.\n\n### C2\n\nThe most recent Farseer sample (#1, as per Table 2 above) communicates with update.tcpdo[.]net over TCP port 158. The contents of the\nnetwork communications are encoded, unlike the earlier Farseer samples that used no encoding, highlighting one of many changes in the\nevolution of this malware. Figure 10 below highlights some of the key differences between the three samples used in the analysis for this\nappendix section.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 Timeline for 3 Farseer samples in analysis; comparing notable differences_\n\nSample #2 (SHA256: 4AB41A025...) behaves almost identically as the others but with the following differences:\n\nPersistent VBS script renamed to common.vbs\nEncoded network communications\nConfiguration file renamed to base.dat\nEncrypted and compressed configuration file\nDoes not employ the use of any decoy documents\n\nThis sample, seen in early April 2018, communicates with honor2020[.]ga, which started resolving to 199.247.25[.]110 in August 2018,\naccording to Passive Total.\n\nDomain honor2020[.]ga bucks the trend when compared to others’ third-level domains, as per Table 1, above. From what we can tell, it has no\nsuch subdomains.\n\nOther Farseer samples fall into the same bucket as honor2020[.]ga. That is, they have no third-level domains, or don’t match the pattern of\nothers, and they share no overlaps to existing infrastructure whether used by Farseer or other malware families. Examples\ninclude windowsnetwork[.]org and newfacebk[.]com. The latter does share one third-level domain with the others in Table 1 but that’s where\nthe commonality ends.\n\nReviewing the dozen or so domains resolving to 199.247.25[.]110, most also make use free ccTLDs from Freenom, including .tk and .ml as per\nthe .ga in honor2020[.]ga. At this point, these domains and others resolving to this IP appear unrelated to Farseer, except\nfor honor2020[.]ga that is connected to Farseer sample 4AB41A025.... It’s possible honor2020[.]ga was simply chosen during testing for this\nmore recent Farseer sample but whatever the reason, it’s a change from the typically-used .com, .net and .org TLDs used by other samples.\n\nThe final sample to discuss (9E08EFC73…) as per Table 2 above, is the oldest sample we have record of in AutoFocus, seen on April 19th,\n2016. In this case, a decoy PDF file is dropped and executed from the victim’s %TEMP% folder as the malware continues to execute – a\nbehavior not seen again in other Farseer samples.
