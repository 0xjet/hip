Based on an IP found in a Laplas\nsample from Malware Bazaar.\n\nThe full list can be found at the end of post.\n\n[Link to Sample](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/825b0080782dee075f8aac11c3a682f86c5d3aa5462bd16be0ed511a181dd7ba/?ref=embee-research.ghost.io)\n\nSHA256: 825b0080782dee075f8aac11c3a682f86c5d3aa5462bd16be0ed511a181dd7ba\n\n[Links to relevant existing research by OALABS and](https://research.openanalysis.net/golang/laplace/python/research/ida/goresym/alphagolang/2022/11/27/laplace.html?ref=embee-research.ghost.io#Laplas-String) [Chris Duggan. Chris in particular has](https://twitter.com/TLP_R3D/status/1652223625104179201?ref=embee-research.ghost.io)\nsome work that is very similar to this.\n\nSearching this ip in shodan reveals a server that redirects to https://laplas[.].app\n\n\n-----\n\nSearching laplas.app reveals 27 servers. Each server appears to be a redirector to the\nmain Laplas site.\n\nSearching laplas.app in Censys reveals 22 servers. Two of which were not in the original\nShodan list.\n\nOne result 31.42.176[.]127 contains a reference to CN=Laplas.app. This result appears to\nbe the primary server.\n\n\n-----\n\nSearching for the common name of laplas.app does not reveal additional infrastructure.\nOnly the initial result of 31.42.176[.]127 was found.\n\nOf the 22 results with Censys, No other common names were available that could be used\nfor pivoting.\n\nOnly one Jarm hash was available. This was a common Jarm fingerprint with around 205K\nresults and hence was not useful for pivoting.\n```\nservices.jarm.fingerprint=15d3fd16d29d29d00042d43d000000fe02290512647416dcf0a4\n00ccbc0b6b\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n## Complete List of Potential Laplas Stealer Infrastructure\n\nComplete list of IP's based on searches for laplas.app in both Shodan and Censys.\n```\n31.42.176.127\n\n37.220.87.60\n\n45.81.243.208\n\n45.159.188.109\n\n45.159.188.158\n\n45.159.189.33\n\n45.159.189.105\n\n65.109.140.234\n\n78.153.130.208\n\n79.137.195.205\n\n79.137.199.252\n\n80.85.241.66\n\n85.192.40.252\n\n85.192.41.87\n\n89.23.97.128\n\n89.185.85.79\n\n95.214.27.252\n\n104.193.254.40\n\n104.193.255.50\n\n163.123.142.220\n\n176.113.115.25\n\n185.106.92.104\n\n185.174.137.94\n\n185.209.161.89\n\n185.213.208.247\n\n185.223.93.251\n\n193.188.23.86\n\n195.133.75.43\n\n212.113.106.172\n\n```\n\n-----",
