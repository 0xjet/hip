On July 5, 2021, our team at Splunk pushed out a rapid\n[response blog to help organizations detect REvil Ransomware Kaseya in Splunk. While](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/kaseya-sera-what-revil-shall-encrypt-shall-encrypt.html)\n**Splunk was not impacted by the ransomware attack, as a security leader we want to**\nhelp the industry by providing tools, guidance and support.\n\nToday, we’re here to provide more insights and research around this ransomware\norganization, in hopes to help businesses around the world understand the group and their\ntactics.\n\n## Introduction to REvil\n\nThe REvil payload (Ransomware Evil or also known as Sodinokibi) is ransomware as a\nservice criminal enterprise. REvil is said to be related to the criminal group known as\n[GandCrab. In a Ransomware as a service scheme, malicious actors partner with affiliates to](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/ransom-gandcrab/)\nextend their botnets and reap profits from new additions and attacks brought to them by\naffiliates. The profit is shared with affiliates which encourages them to infect more victims.\n\nThe REvil payload is associated with some of the following attack vectors:\n\nElliptic curve cryptography(ECC) for file encryption (files, shares)\nWindows Remote Desktop (RDP) brute force entry\nDouble extortion threat\nTarget VPN devices\nPhishing emails\nAffiliates may choose different attack vectors including specific software exploitation\n\n## Understanding How REvil Ransomware is Executed in a Simulation\n\nThe following images show REvil ransomware execution replicated via Splunk Attack\nRange. First, we can see the ransom note indicating the site located on the dark web where\nthe victim needs to go for further information.\n\n\n-----\n\nREvil ransomware execution replicated via Splunk Attack Range\n\n\nThe ransomware payload does not disable the systems completely, even though the\ndocuments are indeed encrypted, the system is left with enough capacity to download the\nTOR browser program and install it. Once a victim browses to the named site via TOR\nbrowser, they find a form where the key found in the ransom note is meant to be entered.\nNotice there is a captcha in this form.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter entering the key the victim is presented with a page with instructions on the steps to\nfollow to be able to decrypt the files.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the following capture, the Monero (XMR) address where victims are supposed to send\npayment can be seen.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe next capture shows the Dark Web page where the REvil ransomware gang advertises\nthe information they claim they obtained from victims that did not pay the ransom.\n\n\n-----\n\n### REvil Command-line Arguments\n\nREvil Ransomware also has several command line parameters to dictate its behavior or\nfeatures it wants to execute.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command-line Parameter** **Description**\n\n-nolan Do not encrypt network share\n\n-nolocal Do not encrypt the local drive\n\n-path Encrypt specific folder path\n\n-fast Fast encryption\n\n\n-----\n\n-full Encrypt both network and local drive\n\n### REvil Configuration JSON File\n\nREvil uses RC4 encryption/decryption algorithm to decrypt its notable strings and its\nconfiguration file. REvil does this by parsing the 0x20 bytes RC4 key placed in one of its\nsections and verifying the checksum hash of the encrypted config file in its code body. This\nconfiguration file (JSON format) contains information and conditions on how it will encrypt\nthe files in the compromised machine.\n\nBelow is the screenshot and description of the notable field in that configuration file.\n\n\n-----\n\n**REvil Config Field Name** **Description**\n\npk Public key (in Base64)\n\npid REvil versioning ID\n\nsub REvil tag number\n\ndbg Is it dbg mode\n\n\n-----\n\nwipe Wipe folder flag\n\nfld folder list it wants to skip during the encryption process\n\nfls File list it wants to skip during the encryption process\n\next File extension it wants to skip during the encryption process\n\nwfld The folder it wants to wipe\n\nprc Process name list it wants to terminate\n\ndmn REvil C2 domain list\n\nsvc Service name list it wants to stop\n\nnbody Ransomware notes in base64 format\n\nnname Ransomware notes file extension\n\nimg Ransomware notes that will be in bitmap form\n\narn Persistence flag\n\nnet C2 communication flag\n\n### Kill Switch for REvil Ransomware\n\nThis ransomware also has a kill switch. It tries to avoid compromising a machine with a\nspecific keyboard layout and languages like (Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, and many\nmore) as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Privilege Escalation\n\nREvil Ransomware will try to run itself using “runas” command to have a privilege\nescalation of execution.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Persistence\n\nIf the “arn” field in its configuration file is enabled, it will create an autorun registry on the\ncompromised machine as a persistence mechanism.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Defacement\n\nAside from the ransomware notes, it will generate in several folders in the compromised\nmachine, it will also create a bitmap containing a note that the machine is also infected.\n\n\n-----\n\n### COM Object\n\nThe Splunk Threat Research team also found some function in REvil ransomware where it\nuses com object IWbemClassObject “4590f811-1d3a-11d0-891f-00aa004b2e24” and\n“49BD2028-1523-11D1-AD79-00C04FD8FDFF” to execute root/cimv2 namespace or\nprivilege escalation.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Other Registry Entry**\n\nREvil is known to have a randomly generated file extension (5-10 characters) that will be\nused for its ransomware notes filename and for the files it encrypts. This randomly\ngenerated string will also save in a unique registry key. In this case, the randomly generated\nfile extension is “.teu459110”\n\n\n-----\n\n### Machine Info\n\nREvil ransomware will also gather some information about the compromised machine like\nthe computer name, user name, language used by the machine, product name, operating\nsystem, network group, OS version, and file extension it generates for the encrypted files.\nBelow is the example of the information in json format.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Defense Evasion\n\nIt will also execute a base 64 encoded PowerShell script command that will delete the\nshadow copy of the compromised machine.\n\nBase 64 encoded:\n```\npowershell -e\nRwBlAHQALQBXAG0AaQBPAGIAagBlAGMAdAAgAFcAaQBuADMAMgBfAFMAaABhAGQAbwB3AGMAbwBwAHkAIAB8A\n\n```\nBase 64 decoded:\n```\nGet-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy |
