    "plain_text": "# Researchers Say They Uncovered Uzbekistan Hacking Operations Due to Spectacularly Bad OPSEC\n\n**[vice.com/en_us/article/3kx5y3/uzbekistan-hacking-operations-uncovered-due-to-spectacularly-bad-opsec](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3kx5y3/uzbekistan-hacking-operations-uncovered-due-to-spectacularly-bad-opsec)**\n\nNation-state spy agencies are only as good as their operational security—the care they take\nto keep their digital spy operations from being discovered. But occasionally a government\nthreat actor appears on the scene that gets it all wrong.\n\nThis is the case with a threat actor recently discovered by Kaspersky Lab that it’s calling\nSandCat—believed to be Uzbekistan’s [repressive and much-feared intelligence agency, the](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/world/asia/uzbekistan-reform.html)\nState Security Service (SSS).\n\nThe group’s lax operational security includes using the name of a military group with ties to\nthe SSS to register a domain used in its attack infrastructure; installing Kaspersky’s antivirus\nsoftware on machines it uses to write new malware, allowing Kaspersky to detect and grab\nmalicious code still in development before it’s deployed; and embedding a screenshot of one\nof its developer’s machines in a test file, exposing a major attack platform as it was in\ndevelopment. The group’s mistakes led Kaspersky to discover four zero-day exploits\nSandCat had purchased from third-party brokers to target victim machines, effectively\nrendering those exploits ineffective. And the mistakes not only allowed Kaspersky to track\nthe Uzbek spy agency’s activity but also the activity of other nation-state groups in Saudi\nArabia and the United Arab Emirates who were using some of the same exploits SandCat\nwas using.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese guys [Uzbekistan s intelligence agency] have been around for quite a long time and\nup until now I’d never heard of Uzbekistan having a cyber capability,\" said Brian\nBartholomew, a researcher with Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team who will\npresent his findings about SandCat today in London at the VirusBulletin conference. “So it\nwas kind of a shocker to me to know that they … were buying all of [these exploits] and\ntargeting all these people and yet no one has ever written about them.”\n\nThe SSS, previously known as the National Security Service, isn’t new to the spy game: It\nemerged in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union to succeed the KGB as Uzbekistan’s\nnational intelligence agency and secret police, adopting some of the KGB’s surveillance\n[technologies as well as its oppressive tactics. Known for its torture and human rights abuses,](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/files/webfm/Documents/issues/eur_62_1086_2015_uzbekistantorture_fullreport.pdf?sMDvswFYigdhKzuEiNn89TaIgSBqYtF8)\nthe SSS was revamped in early 2018 by the country’s new president, who sought to reform\nits repressive ways. But earlier this year the new head of the spy agency was booted after a\nyear on the job, reportedly amid allegations that the agency had turned its spying capabilities\nagainst the new president and his family.\n\nThe agency’s interest in offensive hacking operations were first exposed in 2015 when a\nhacker named Phineas Fisher hacked the Hacking Team, an Italian firm that sells hacking\ntools to governments and law enforcement agencies, and published thousands of emails\n[exposing the company’s correspondence with customers, including the SSS. According to](https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/?q=itt.uz&mfrom=&mto=&title=&notitle=&date=&nofrom=&noto=&count=50&sort=0#searchresult)\nthe emails, which cover the years 2011-2015, the SSS spent nearly a million dollars on\nHacking Team tools. But its hacking operations have gone largely unnoticed until recently.\n\nIn October 2018, researchers at Kaspersky stumbled across SandCat after discovering an\nalready known piece of malware called Chainshot on a victim’s machine in the Middle East.\nChainshot had been used by two other nation-state threat actors in the Middle East in the\npast—groups security researchers have attributed to the UAE and Saudi Arabia—but the\nmalware in this case was using infrastructure not associated with either of these countries,\nsuggesting it was a different group Kaspersky hadn’t seen before. SandCat was also using a\nzero-day exploit to install Chainshot.\n\nAs Kaspersky analyzed machines infected with the exploit and Chainshot, and began to dig\ninto the group’s infrastructure that was tied to the infections, it ultimately led Kaspersky to\ndiscover three more zero days used by the same group each of which got essentially burned\nas the vulnerabilities they attacked got patched\n\n“I’d call [SandCat] my zero-day Pez dispenser,” Bartholomew told Motherboard, “because it\nseemed like every time we’d [find] another zero-day and patch it, they’d come up with\nanother one. [T]hey’re burning through them like nothing, which tells me one thing—that they\nhave tons of money.”\n\nThe discoveries didn’t seem to affect SandCat. But as each zero-day got burned for\nSandCat, it also got burned for Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen spy agencies purchase zero-day exploits from brokers, they often have two options:\npay a premium rate for an exclusive right to use an exploit, or pay less for exploits that other\ncustomers of the broker also get to use. The latter option comes with a risk, though—if any\ncustomer using a shared exploit is careless or reckless, this can result in the exploit being\ncaught, effectively burning it for anyone else who paid to use it.\n\n“All it takes is one sloppy customer,” Bartholomew said. “One customer who is bad at\nOPSEC ruins it for all the others.”\n\nKaspersky believes SandCat purchased its exploits from two Israeli companies known as the\nNSO Group and Candiru but provided Motherboard with no evidence to support this. NSO\nGroup is known for developing and selling some of the most powerful exploits for hacking\n[mobile phones, including malware that has been used to spy on journalists and](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59zajx/mexicos-sloppy-hacking-attempts-expose-customers-of-a-dollar1-billion-spyware-company) [dissidents.](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mg7pjy/ahmed-mansoor-million-dollar-dissident-government-spyware)\nCandiru is more of a full-service agency that provides, in addition to attack tools for\ncomputers, a [platform for managing attack operations. A spokeswoman for the NSO Group](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-top-secret-israeli-cyberattack-firm-revealed-1.6805950)\nwouldn’t say whether the company has ever sold exploits to the SSS but told Motherboard\nthe company “does not develop or license any products for PC-related interception such as\n‘Chainshot.’” Motherboard was unable to reach Candiru. A different Israeli company is known\n[to have supplied surveillance equipment to Uzbekistan, suggesting strong ties between the](https://equalit.ie/deflect-labs-report-6/)\nlatter and the Israeli surveillance industry.\n\nInitially Kaspersky didn’t know who SandCat was, but it didn’t take a lot of work to tie it to\nUzbekistan’s SSS.\n\nKaspersky discovered that SandCat’s developers had installed Kaspersky antivirus on their\ndevelopment machines—presumably to test whether malware they were developing inhouse\ncould bypass the detection tool. But they’re using it with the telemetry reporting feature of the\nantivirus tool enabled, which causes the antivirus software to grab a copy of any files on the\nmachines that it suspects are malicious and sends them back to Kaspersky for analysis.\n\n“[T]hat’s how we caught a lot of this stuff … every time they would test it, our [software]\nwould pull the binaries back,” Bartholomew said.\n\nFurthermore, any time SSS's suppliers sent SandCat new exploits for use, they arrived on a\nthumb drive. When SandCat developers inserted the drive into their machines, the\nKaspersky software would automatically scan it for malware and grab files it deemed\nmalicious.\n\n“I think we got one of those exploits before they even were able to use it,” Bartholomew said.\n\nHaving identified the systems SandCat used for development and testing, they discovered\nthat these machines used IP addresses that resolved to the “itt.uz” domain. When\nBartholomew looked up the registration information for itt.uz, it showed a 2008 registration to\n\n\n-----\n\nan entity in Tashkent, Uzbekistan called Military Unit 02616. Military Unit 02616 is cited in\nan Uzbekistan court case for doing forensics on electronic devices seized from the defendant\nby an investigative unit of the SSS.\n\n“Can it be this easy?” Bartholomew said he wondered. “I really wrestled hard with that for a\nlong time thinking there’s no way it’s this easy. But every piece of data that we have links\nback to the same thing.”\n\nSSS's email domain resolved to the IP address 84.54.69.202, and the systems SandCat\nuses for developing and testing its malware use a nearly identical address 84.54.69.203.\nSandCat uses these same machines to upload test files to Virus Total. Virus Total is a\nwebsite that aggregates numerous anti-virus programs so that anyone can upload suspicious\nfiles to the site to see if it’s malicious. Attackers also sometimes upload their new malware to\nthe site to test if it can successfully bypass antivirus detection, but Virus Total records the IP\naddress from which every file is uploaded, which means that malicious files SandCat\nuploaded to the site for such testing can be traced back to SandCat’s machines.\n\n“As a developer you don’t upload to Virus Total, [but] if you do, don’t do it from the same IP\naddresses that you’re conducting your operations from,” Bartholomew said\n\nIn October 2018, during the time SandCat’s zero-days were starting to be discovered and\nburned, the group began developing its own attack platform called Sharpa. Bartholomew\nthinks whoever supplied SSS with its zero-days and platform until then got fed up with so\nmany of the tools being burned quickly, forcing SandCat to develop inhouse.\n\nIt’s also possible the change was simply due to a natural progression, however—many spy\nagencies start out using a platform and malware purchased from others before developing\ninternal capabilities to build their own. Or the move might have been brought on by\nbudgetary constraints after the new president announced in 2017 he planned to rein in the\npowers of the SSS, reduce the number of dissidents being monitored on government\nblacklists, and transfer some SSS responsibilities to other agencies.\n\nBut if SandCat’s mistakes did cause its suppliers to fire it as a customer, the group didn’t\nreform its bad habits in developing its new platform.\n\nIn the process of conducting some tests, one of SandCat’s developers took a screenshot of\nhis desktop with a detailed image of the Sharpa interface open on it, and put it in a test file\nthat he ran on a machine with the Kaspersky software on it. He wanted to be able to load\nSharpa onto victim machines using a malicious Word file and for some reason used the\nscreenshot of his desktop as part of the Word file. When Kaspersky’s software grabbed the\nmalicious file, the researchers learned about the new platform in development as well as\nother intel. The screenshot, for example, shows developer notes written in Uzbek, confirming\n\n\n-----\n\nthe language of the developers, and also shows the interface used to track and control\nSharpa once it’s on infected machines. It also shows the IP addresses for SandCat’s test\nmachines.\n\n“This was really important, because … we didn’t know about [these] addresses [before this].\nSo we were able to go back in our telemetry and find more installations of more stuff\nbecause this IP address showed up in the screenshot,” Bartholomew said.\n\nBartholomew refers to SandCat as “trash actors” because of their reckless mistakes. But he\nthinks their OPSEC failures can be attributed to arrogance and inexperience.\n\n“A lot of the [nation-state threat actors] in that region have the same bravado. They just don’t\ncare [about being stealth]. They adamantly deny everything. And if they get caught they get\ncaught,” he said. But he notes that SandCat is still in the infant stage of development, even\nthough it’s been active in spying a long time, and is bound to make rookie mistakes.\n\nIn publicly exposing the group’s mistakes now, it’s likely that SandCat will improve its\nOPSEC. But Bartholomew says exposing them will also increase the number of researchers\ntracking them, which could help uncover more of their current victims and provide them with\nprotection.\n\n## ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to the [Terms of Use and](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html) [Privacy Policy & to receive electronic](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html)\ncommunications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions,\nadvertisements and sponsored content.\n\n\n-----",
