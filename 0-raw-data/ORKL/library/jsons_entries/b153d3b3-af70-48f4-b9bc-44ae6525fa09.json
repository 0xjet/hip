The actors have targeted\nboth large and small CDCs and subcontractors with\nvarying levels of cybersecurity protocols and resources.\nThese CDCs support contracts for the U.S. Department\nof Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community in the\nfollowing areas:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nActions to Help Protect Against\nRussian State-Sponsored Malicious\nCyber Activity:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nEnforce multifactor authentication.\nEnforce strong, unique passwords.\nEnable M365 Unified Audit Logs.\nImplement endpoint detection and\nresponse tools.\n\nCommand, control, communications, and combat systems;\nIntelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeting;\nWeapons and missile development;\nVehicle and aircraft design; and\nSoftware development, data analytics, computers, and logistics.\n\nHistorically, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors have used common but effective tactics to gain\naccess to target networks, including spearphishing, credential harvesting, brute force/password spray\ntechniques, and known vulnerability exploitation against accounts and networks with weak security.\nThese actors take advantage of simple passwords, unpatched systems, and unsuspecting employees\nto gain initial access before moving laterally through the network to establish persistence and\nexfiltrate data.\nThis document was developed by the FBI, NSA, and CISA in furtherance of their respective cybersecurity\nmissions, including their responsibilities to develop and issue cybersecurity specifications and mitigations.\nThis document is marked TLP:WHITE. Disclosure is not limited. Sources may use TLP:WHITE when information\ncarries minimal or no foreseeable risk of misuse, in accordance with applicable rules and procedures for public\nrelease. Subject to standard copyright rules, TLP:WHITE information may be distributed without restriction. For\nmore information on the Traffic Light Protocol, see https://www.cisa.gov/tlp.\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nFBI | NSA | CISA\n\nIn many attempted compromises, these actors have employed similar tactics to gain access to\nenterprise and cloud networks, prioritizing their efforts against the widely used Microsoft 365 (M365)\nenvironment. The actors often maintain persistence by using legitimate credentials and a variety of\nmalware when exfiltrating emails and data.\nThese continued intrusions have enabled the actors to acquire sensitive, unclassified information, as\nwell as CDC-proprietary and export-controlled technology. The acquired information provides\nsignificant insight into U.S. weapons platforms development and deployment timelines, vehicle\nspecifications, and plans for communications infrastructure and information technology. By acquiring\nproprietary internal documents and email communications, adversaries may be able to adjust their\nown military plans and priorities, hasten technological development efforts, inform foreign\npolicymakers of U.S. intentions, and target potential sources for recruitment. Given the sensitivity of\ninformation widely available on unclassified CDC networks, the FBI, NSA, and CISA anticipate that\nRussian state-sponsored cyber actors will continue to target CDCs for U.S. defense information in the\nnear future. These agencies encourage all CDCs to apply the recommended mitigations in this\nadvisory, regardless of evidence of compromise.\nFor additional information on Russian state-sponsored cyber activity, see CISA's webpage, Russia\nCyber Threat Overview and Advisories.\n\nTHREAT DETAILS\nTargeted Industries and Assessed Motive\nRussian state-sponsored cyber actors have targeted U.S. CDCs from at least January 2020, through\nFebruary 2022. The actors leverage access to CDC networks to obtain sensitive data about U.S.\ndefense and intelligence programs and capabilities. Compromised entities have included CDCs\nsupporting the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, U.S. Space Force, and DoD and Intelligence\nprograms.\nDuring this two-year period, these actors have maintained persistent access to multiple CDC\nnetworks, in some cases for at least six months. In instances when the actors have successfully\nobtained access, the FBI, NSA, and CISA have noted regular and recurring exfiltration of emails and\ndata. For example, during a compromise in 2021, threat actors exfiltrated hundreds of documents\nrelated to the company’s products, relationships with other countries, and internal personnel and legal\nmatters.\nThrough these intrusions, the threat actors have acquired unclassified CDC-proprietary and exportcontrolled information. This theft has granted the actors significant insight into U.S. weapons\nplatforms development and deployment timelines, plans for communications infrastructure, and\nspecific technologies employed by the U.S. government and military. Although many contract awards\nand descriptions are publicly accessible, program developments and internal company\ncommunications remain sensitive. Unclassified emails among employees or with government\ncustomers often contain proprietary details about technological and scientific research, in addition to\nprogram updates and funding statuses. See figures 1 and 2 for information on targeted customers,\nindustries, and information.\n\nPage 2 of 19 | Product ID: AA22-047A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nFBI | NSA | CISA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nWeapons and\nMissile Development\n\nVehicle and\nAircraft Design\n\nSoftware Development and\nInformation Technology\n\nData Analytics\n\nLogistics\n\nFigure 1.

Exfiltrated Information\n\nThreat Actor Activity\nNote: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® for Enterprise framework, version 10. See the ATT&CK for\nEnterprise for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques. See the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\n(TTPs) section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques.\n\nInitial Access\nRussian state-sponsored cyber actors use brute force methods, spearphishing, harvested credentials,\nand known vulnerabilities to gain initial access to CDC networks.\n•\n\nThreat actors use brute force techniques [T1110] to identify valid account credentials\n[T1589.001] for domain and M365 accounts. After obtaining domain credentials, the actors\nuse them to gain initial access to the networks. Note: For more information, see joint NSAFBI-CISA Cybersecurity Advisory: Russian GRU Conducting Global Brute Force Campaign to\nCompromise Enterprise and Cloud Environments.\n\n•\n\nThreat actors send spearphishing emails with links to malicious domains [T1566.002] and use\npublicly available URL shortening services to mask the link [T1027]. Embedding shortened\nURLs instead of actor-controlled malicious domains is an obfuscation technique meant to\nbypass virus and spam scanning tools. The technique often promotes a false legitimacy to the\nemail recipient, increasing the probability of a victim’s clicking on the link.\n\n•\n\nThe threat actors use harvested credentials in conjunction with known vulnerabilities—for\nexample, CVE-2020-0688 and CVE-2020-17144—on public-facing applications [T1078,\nT1190], such as virtual private networks (VPNs), to escalate privileges and gain remote code\nexecution (RCE) on the exposed applications.1 In addition, threat actors have exploited CVE2018-13379 on FortiClient to obtain credentials to access networks.\n\n•\n\nAs CDCs find and patch known vulnerabilities on their networks, the actors alter their\ntradecraft to seek new means of access. This activity necessitates CDCs maintain constant\n\nPage 3 of 19 | Product ID: AA22-047A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nFBI | NSA | CISA\n\nvigilance for software vulnerabilities and out-of-date security configurations, especially in\ninternet-facing systems.\nCredential Access\nAfter gaining access to networks, the threat actors map the Active Directory (AD) and connect to\ndomain controllers, from which they exfiltrate credentials and export copies of the AD database\nntds.dit [T1003.003]. In multiple instances, the threat actors have used Mimikatz to dump admin\ncredentials from the domain controllers.\nCollection\nUsing compromised M365 credentials, including global admin accounts, the threat actors can gain\naccess to M365 resources, including SharePoint pages [T1213.002], user profiles, and user emails\n[T1114.002].\nCommand and Control\nThe threat actors routinely use virtual private servers (VPSs) as an encrypted proxy. The actors use\nVPSs, as well as small office and home office (SOHO) devices, as operational nodes to evade\ndetection [T1090.003].\nPersistence\nIn multiple instances, the threat actors maintained persistent access for at least six months. Although\nthe actors have used a variety of malware to maintain persistence, the FBI, NSA, and CISA have also\nobserved intrusions that did not rely on malware or other persistence mechanisms. In these cases, it\nis likely the threat actors relied on possession of legitimate credentials for persistence [T1078],\nenabling them to pivot to other accounts, as needed, to maintain access to the compromised\nenvironments.\n\nTactics, Techniques, and Procedures\nThe following table maps observed Russian state-sponsored cyber activity to the MITRE ATT&CK for\nEnterprise framework. Several of the techniques listed in the table are based on observed procedures\nin contextual order. Therefore, some of the tactics and techniques listed in their respective columns\nappear more than once. See Appendix A for a functional breakdown of TTPs. Note: For specific\ncountermeasures related to each ATT&CK technique, see the Enterprise Mitigations section and\nMITRE D3FEND™.\n\nPage 4 of 19 | Product ID: AA22-047A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nFBI | NSA | CISA\n\nTLP:WHITE\nTable 1: Observed Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)\nTACTIC\n\nTECHNIQUE\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nReconnaissance\n[TA0043]\n\nGather Victim Identity\nInformation: Credentials\n[T1589.001]\n\nThreat actors used brute force\ntechniques to identify valid account\ncredentials for domain and M365\naccounts. After obtaining domain\ncredentials, the actors used them to gain\ninitial access.\n\nCredential Access\n[TA0006]\n\nBrute Force [T1110]\n\nInitial Access [TA0001]\n\nExternal Remote Services\n[T1133]\n\nThreat actors continue to research\nvulnerabilities in Fortinet’s FortiGate\nVPN devices, conducting brute force\nattacks and leveraging CVE-2018-13379\nto gain credentials to access victim\nnetworks.2\n\nInitial Access [TA0001]\n\nValid Accounts [T1078]\n\nPrivilege Escalation\n[TA0004]\n\nExploit Public-Facing\nApplication [T1190]\n\nThreat actors used credentials in\nconjunction with known vulnerabilities on\npublic-facing applications, such as\nvirtual private networks (VPNs)—CVE2020-0688 and CVE-2020-17144—to\nescalate privileges and gain remote\ncode execution (RCE) on the exposed\napplications.3\n\nInitial Access [TA0001]\n\nPhishing: Spearphishing\nLink [T1566.002]\n\nDefense Evasion\n[TA0005]\n\nInitial Access [TA0001]\nCredential Access\n[TA0006]\n\nInitial Access [TA0001]\n\nObfuscated Files or\nInformation [T1027]\n\nOS Credential Dumping:\nNTDS [T1003.003]\nValid Accounts: Domain\nAccounts [T1078.002]\nValid Accounts: Cloud\nAccounts [T1078.004]\n\nThreat actors sent spearphishing emails\nusing publicly available URL shortening\nservices. Embedding shortened URLs\ninstead of the actor-controlled malicious\ndomain is an obfuscation technique\nmeant to bypass virus and spam\nscanning tools. The technique often\npromotes a false legitimacy to the email\nrecipient and thereby increases the\npossibility that a victim clicks on the link.\nThreat actors logged into a victim’s VPN\nserver and connected to the domain\ncontrollers, from which they exfiltrated\ncredentials and exported copies of the\nAD database ntds.dit.\nIn one case, the actors used valid\ncredentials of a global admin account\n\nPage 5 of 19 | Product ID: AA22-047A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nFBI | NSA | CISA\n\nTLP:WHITE\nTACTIC\n\nTECHNIQUE\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nPrivilege Escalation\n[TA0004]\n\nData from Information\nRepositories: SharePoint\n[T1213.002]\n\nwithin the M365 tenant to log into the\nadministrative portal and change\npermissions of an existing enterprise\napplication to give read access to all\nSharePoint pages in the environment, as\nwell as tenant user profiles and email\ninboxes.\n\nInitial Access [TA0001]\n\nValid Accounts: Domain\nAccounts [T1078.002]\n\nCollection [TA0009]\n\nEmail Collection [T1114]\n\nIn one case, the threat actors used\nlegitimate credentials to exfiltrate emails\nfrom the victim's enterprise email\nsystem.\n\nPersistence [TA0003]\n\nValid Accounts [T1078]\n\nThreat actors used valid accounts for\npersistence. After some victims reset\npasswords for individually compromised\naccounts, the actors pivoted to other\naccounts, as needed, to maintain\naccess.\n\nDiscovery [TA0007]\n\nFile and Network\nDiscovery [T1083]\n\nAfter gaining access to networks, the\nthreat actors used BloodHound to map\nthe Active Directory.\n\nDiscovery [TA0007]\n\nDomain Trust Discovery\n[T1482]\n\nThreat actors gathered information on\ndomain trust relationships that were\nused to identify lateral movement\nopportunities.\n\nCommand and Control\n[TA0011]\n\nProxy: Multi-hop Proxy\n[T1090.003]\n\nThreat actors used multiple disparate\nnodes, such as VPSs, to route traffic to\nthe target.\n\nCollection [TA0009]\n\nLateral Movement\n[TA0008]\n\nPage 6 of 19 | Product ID: AA22-047A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nFBI | NSA | CISA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nDETECTION\nThe FBI, NSA, and CISA urge all CDCs to investigate suspicious activity in their enterprise and cloud\nenvironments. Note: For additional approaches on uncovering malicious cyber activity, see joint\nadvisory Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity, authored by CISA\nand the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\nDetect Unusual Activity\nImplement robust log collection and retention. Robust logging is critical for detecting unusual\nactivity. Without a centralized log collection and monitoring capability, organizations have limited\nability to investigate incidents or detect the threat actor behavior described in this advisory.\nDepending on the environment, tools and solutions include:\n•\n\nCloud native solutions, such as cloud-native security incident and event management (SIEM) tools.\n\n•\n\nThird-party tools, such as Sparrow, to review Microsoft cloud environments and to detect\nunusual activity, service principals, and application activity. Note: For guidance on using these\nand other detection tools, refer to CISA Cybersecurity Advisory Detecting Post-Compromise\nThreat Activity in Microsoft Cloud Environments.\n\nLook for Evidence of Known TTPs\n•\n\nLook for behavioral evidence or network and host-based artifacts from known TTPs\nassociated with this activity. To detect password spray activity, review authentication logs for\nsystem and application login failures of valid accounts. Look for frequent, failed authentication\nattempts across multiple accounts.\n\n•\n\nTo detect use of compromised credentials in combination with a VPS, follow the steps below:\no\n\no\no\n\no\n\no\no\no\n\nReview logs for suspicious “impossible logins,” such as logins with changing\nusernames, user agent strings, and IP address combinations or logins where IP\naddresses do not align to the expected user’s geographic location.\nLook for one IP used for multiple accounts, excluding expected logins.\nSearch for “impossible travel,” which occurs when a user logs in from multiple IP\naddresses that are a significant geographic distance apart (i.e., a person could not\nrealistically travel between the geographic locations of the two IP addresses in the time\nbetween logins). Note: This detection opportunity can result in false positives if\nlegitimate users apply VPN solutions before connecting to networks.\nEvaluate processes and program execution command-line arguments that may\nindicate credential dumping, especially attempts to access or copy the ntds.dit file\nfrom a domain controller.\nIdentify suspicious privileged account use after resetting passwords or applying\nuser account mitigations.\nReview logs for unusual activity in typically dormant accounts.\nLook for unusual user agent strings, such as strings not typically associated with\nnormal user activity, which may indicate bot activity.\n\nPage 7 of 19 | Product ID: AA22-047A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nFBI | NSA | CISA\n\nINCIDENT RESPONSE AND REMEDIATION\nOrganizations with evidence of compromise should assume full identity compromise and initiate a full\nidentity reset.\n•\n\nReset passwords for all local accounts. These accounts should include Guest,\nHelpAssistant, DefaultAccount, System, Administrator, and krbtgt. It is essential to reset the\npassword for the krbtgt account, as this account is responsible for handling Kerberos ticket\nrequests as well as encrypting and signing them. Note: Reset the krbtgt account twice and\nconsecutively with a 10-hour waiting period between resets (i.e., perform the first krbtgt\npassword reset, wait 10 hours, and then follow with a second krbtgt password reset). The\nkrbtgt password resets may take a long time to propagate fully on large AD environments.\nRefer to Microsoft’s AD Forest Recovery - Resetting the krbtgt password guidance and\nautomation script for additional information.4,5\n\n•\n\nReset all domain user, admin, and service account passwords.\n\nNote: For guidance on evicting advanced persistent threat (APT) actors from cloud and enterprise\nenvironments, refer to CISA Analysis Report Eviction Guidance for Networks Affected by the SolarWinds and\nActive Directory/Microsoft 365 (M365) Compromise. Although this guidance was drafted for federal agencies\ncompromised by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) via the SolarWinds Orion supply chain\ncompromise, the steps provided in the Eviction Phase are applicable for all organizations crafting eviction plans\nfor suspected APT actors.\n\nMITIGATIONS\nThe FBI, NSA, and CISA encourage all CDCs, with or without evidence of compromise, to apply the\nfollowing mitigations to reduce the risk of compromise by this threat actor. While these mitigations are\nnot intended to be all-encompassing, they address common TTPs observed in these intrusions and\nwill help to mitigate against common malicious activity.\n\nImplement Credential Hardening\nEnable Multifactor Authentication\n•\n\nEnable multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users, without exception. Subsequent\nauthentication may not require MFA, enabling the possibility to bypass MFA by reusing single\nfactor authentication assertions (e.g., Kerberos authentication). Reducing the lifetime of\nassertions will cause account re-validation of their MFA requirements.6 Service accounts\nshould not use MFA. Automation and platform features (e.g., Group Managed Service\nAccounts, gMSA) can provide automatic and periodic complex password management for\nservice accounts, reducing the threat surface against single factor authentication assertions.7\n\nPage 8 of 19 | Product ID: AA22-047A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nFBI | NSA | CISA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nEnforce Strong, Unique Passwords\n•\n\nRequire accounts to have strong, unique passwords. Passwords should not be reused\nacross multiple accounts or stored on the system where an adversary may have access.\n\n•\n\nEnable password management functions, such as Local Administrator Password Solution\n(LAPS), for local administrative accounts. This will reduce the burden of users’ managing\npasswords and encourage them to have strong passwords.\n\nIntroduce Account Lockout and Time-Based Access Features\n•\n\nImplement time-out and lock-out features in response to repeated failed login attempts.\n\n•\n\nConfigure time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher. For\nexample, the Just-In-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when\nneeded and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the\nZero Trust model). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to\nautomatically disable administrator accounts at the AD level when the account is not in\ndirect need. When the account is needed, individual users submit their requests through\nan automated process that enables access to a system but only for a set timeframe to\nsupport task completion.\n\nReduce Credential Exposure\n•\n\nUse virtualization solutions on modern hardware and software to ensure credentials are\nsecurely stored, and protect credentials via capabilities, such as Windows Defender\nCredential Guard (CredGuard) and Trusted Platform Module (TPM).8 Protecting domain\ncredentials with CredGuard requires configuration and has limitations in protecting other types\nof credentials (e.g., WDigest and local accounts).9,10 CredGuard uses TPMs to protect stored\ncredentials. TPMs function as a system integrity observer and trust anchor ensuring the\nintegrity of the boot sequence and mechanisms (e.g., UEFI Secure Boot). Installation of\nWindows 11 requires TPM v2.0.11 Disabling WDigest and rolling expiring NTLM secrets in\nsmartcards will further protect other credentials not protected by CredGuard.12,13\n\nEstablish Centralized Log Management\n•\n\nCreate a centralized log management system. Centralized logging applications allow\nnetwork defenders to look for anomalous activity, such as out-of-place communications\nbetween devices or unaccountable login failures, in the network environment.\no\no\no\n\nForward all logs to a SIEM tool.\nEnsure logs are searchable.\nRetain critical and historic network activity logs for a minimum of 180 days.\n\n•\n\nIf using M365, enable Unified Audit Log (UAL)—M365’s logging capability—which contains\nevents from Exchange Online, SharePoint online, OneDrive, Azure AD, Microsoft Teams,\nPowerBI, and other M365 services.\n\n•\n\nCorrelate logs, including M365 logs, from network and host security devices. This\ncorrelation will help with detecting anomalous activity in the network environment and\nconnecting it with potential anomalous activity in M365.\n\nPage 9 of 19 | Product ID: AA22-047A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nFBI | NSA | CISA\n\nTLP:WHITE\nIn addition to setting up centralized logging, organizations should:\n•\n\nEnsure PowerShell logging is turned on. Threat actors often use PowerShell to hide their\nmalicious activities.14\n\n•\n\nUpdate PowerShell instances to version 5.0 or later and uninstall all earlier versions of\nPowerShell. Logs from prior versions are either non-existent or do not record enough detail to\naid in enterprise monitoring and incident response activities.\n\n•\n\nConfirm PowerShell 5.0 instances have module, script block, and transcription logging\nenabled.\n\n•\n\nMonitor remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) logs and disable unused remote\naccess/RDP ports.\n\nInitiate a Software and Patch Management Program\n•\n\nConsider using a centralized patch management system. Failure to deploy software\npatches in a timely manner makes an organization a target of opportunity, increasing its risk of\ncompromise. Organizations can ensure timely patching of software vulnerabilities by\nimplementing an enterprise-wide software and patch management program.15\no\n\no\n\n•\n\nIf an organization is unable to update all software shortly after a patch is released,\nprioritize patches for CVEs that are already known to be exploited or that would be\naccessible to the largest number of potential adversaries (such as internet-facing\nsystems).\nSubscribe to CISA cybersecurity notifications and advisories to keep up with\nknown exploited vulnerabilities, security updates, and threats. This will assist\norganizations in maintaining situational awareness of critical software vulnerabilities\nand, if applicable, associated exploitation.\n\nSign up for CISA’s cyber hygiene services, including vulnerability scanning, to help reduce\nexposure to threats. CISA’s vulnerability scanning service evaluates external network\npresence by executing continuous scans of public, static IPs for accessible services and\nvulnerabilities.\n\nEmploy Antivirus Programs\n•\n\nEnsure that antivirus applications are installed on all organizations’ computers and are\nconfigured to prevent spyware, adware, and malware as part of the operating system security\nbaseline.\n\n•\n\nKeep virus definitions up to date.\n\n•\n\nRegularly monitor antivirus scans.\n\nPage 10 of 19 | Product ID: AA22-047A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nFBI | NSA | CISA\n\nUse Endpoint Detection and Response Tools\n•\n\nUtilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools. These tools allow a high degree of\nvisibility into the security status of endpoints and can be an effective defense against threat\nactors. EDR tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral movement, as they have insight\ninto common and uncommon network connections for each host.\n\nMaintain Rigorous Configuration Management Programs\n•\n\nAudit configuration management programs to ensure they can track and mitigate emerging\nthreats. Review system configurations for misconfigurations and security weaknesses. Having\na robust configuration program hinders sophisticated threat operations by limiting the\neffectiveness of opportunistic attacks.16\n\nEnforce the Principle of Least Privilege\n•\n\nApply the principle of least privilege. Administrator accounts should have the minimum\npermissions they need to do their tasks. This can reduce the impact if an administrator\naccount is compromised.\n\n•\n\nFor M365, assign administrator roles to role-based access control (RBAC) to implement\nthe principle of least privilege. Given its high level of default privilege, you should only use the\nGlobal Administrator account when absolutely necessary. Using Azure AD’s numerous other\nbuilt-in administrator roles instead of the Global Administrator account can limit assigning\nunnecessary privileges. Note: Refer to the Microsoft documentation, Azure AD built-in roles,\nfor more information about Azure AD.\n\n•\n\nRemove privileges not expressly required by an account’s function or role.\n\n•\n\nEnsure there are unique and distinct administrative accounts for each set of\nadministrative tasks.\n\n•\n\nCreate non-privileged accounts for privileged users, and ensure they use the nonprivileged accounts for all non-privileged access (e.g., web browsing, email access).\n\n•\n\nReduce the number of domain and enterprise administrator accounts, and remove all\naccounts that are unnecessary.\n\n•\n\nRegularly audit administrative user accounts.\n\n•\n\nRegularly audit logs to ensure new accounts are legitimate users.\n\n•\n\nInstitute a group policy that disables remote interactive logins, and use Domain\nProtected Users Group.\n\nTo assist with identifying suspicious behavior with administrative accounts:\n•\n\nCreate privileged role tracking.\n\n•\n\nCreate a change control process for all privilege escalations and role changes on user\naccounts.\n\nPage 11 of 19 | Product ID: AA22-047A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nFBI | NSA | CISA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n•\n\nEnable alerts on privilege escalations and role changes.\n\n•\n\nLog privileged user changes in the network environment, and create an alert for unusual\nevents.\n\nReview Trust Relationships\n•\n\nReview existing trust relationships with IT service providers, such as managed service\nproviders (MSPs) and cloud service providers (CSPs). Threat actors are known to exploit trust\nrelationships between providers and their customers to gain access to customer networks and\ndata.\n\n•\n\nRemove unnecessary trust relationships.\n\n•\n\nReview contractual relationships with all service providers, and ensure contracts include:\no\no\no\no\n\nSecurity controls the customer deems appropriate.\nAppropriate monitoring and logging of provider-managed customer systems.\nAppropriate monitoring of the service provider’s presence, activities, and connections\nto the customer network.\nNotification of confirmed or suspected security events and incidents occurring on the\nprovider’s infrastructure and administrative networks.\n\nNote: Review CISA’s page on APTs Targeting IT Service Provider Customers and CISA Insights: Mitigations\nand Hardening Guidance for MSPs and Small and Mid-sized Businesses for additional recommendations for\nMSP and CSP customers.\n\nEncourage Remote Work Environment Best Practices\nWith the increase in remote work and use of VPN services due to COVID-19, the FBI, NSA, and CISA\nencourage regularly monitoring remote network traffic, along with employing the following best\npractices. Note: For additional information, see joint NSA-CISA Cybersecurity Information Sheet:\nSelecting and Hardening Remote Access VPN Solutions.\n•\n\nRegularly update VPNs, network infrastructure devices, and devices used for remote\nwork environments with the latest software patches and security configurations.\n\n•\n\nWhen possible, require MFA on all VPN connections. Physical security tokens are the\nmost secure form of MFA, followed by authenticator applications. When MFA is unavailable,\nmandate that employees engaging in remote work use strong passwords.\n\n•\n\nMonitor network traffic for unapproved and unexpected protocols.\n\n•\n\nReduce potential attack surfaces by discontinuing unused VPN servers that may be\nused as a point of entry by adversaries.\n\nPage 12 of 19 | Product ID: AA22-047A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nFBI | NSA | CISA\n\nEstablish User Awareness Best Practices\nCyber actors frequently use unsophisticated methods to gain initial access, which can often be\nmitigated by stronger employee awareness of indicators of malicious activity. The FBI, NSA, and\nCISA recommend the following best practices to improve employee operational security when\nconducting business:\n• Provide end user awareness and training. To help prevent targeted social engineering and\nspearphishing scams, ensure that employees and stakeholders are aware of potential cyber\nthreats and how they are delivered. Also, provide users with training on information security\nprinciples and techniques.\n•\n\nInform employees of the risks of social engineering attacks, e.g., risks associated with\nposting detailed career information to social or professional networking sites.\n\n•\n\nEnsure that employees are aware of what to do and whom to contact when they see\nsuspicious activity or suspect a cyber intrusion to help quickly and efficiently identify\nthreats and employ mitigation strategies.\n\nApply Additional Best Practice Mitigations\n•\n\nDeny atypical inbound activity from known anonymization services, including\ncommercial VPN services and The Onion Router (TOR).\n\n•\n\nImpose listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to\nexecute known and permitted programs under an established security policy.\n\n•\n\nIdentify and create offline backups for critical assets.\n\n•\n\nImplement network segmentation.\n\n•\n\nReview CISA Alert AA20-120A: Microsoft Office 365 Security Recommendations for\nadditional recommendations on hardening M365 cloud environments.\n\nPage 13 of 19 | Product ID: AA22-047A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nFBI | NSA | CISA\n\nREWARDS FOR JUSTICE PROGRAM\nIf you have information on state-sponsored Russian cyber operations targeting U.S. critical\ninfrastructure, contact the Department of State’s Rewards for Justice Program.
