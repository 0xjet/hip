While\nthe general public may be hearing DarkSide’s name for the first time, Intel 471 has been\ntracking those associated with the variant since they first announced their products to the\ncybercrime underground last year.\n\nThe following is an examination of how DarkSide rose to prominence among cybercriminals\n— which Intel 471 has been tracking since they emerged in the underground — in an\necosystem that is teeming with actors looking for new ways to extort businesses out of their\nmoney.\n\nWhile spotted in the wild as far back as August 2020, DarkSide’s developer “debuted” the\nransomware on the popular Russian-language hacker forum XSS in November 2020,\nadvertising that he was looking for partners in an attempt to adopt an affiliate “as-a-service”\nmodel. Soon after, the ransomware was spotted to be behind numerous attacks, including\nseveral incidents targeting manufacturers and law firms in Europe and the United States.\n\nIn March 2021, the developer rolled out a number of new features in an effort to attract new\naffiliates. These included versions for targeting Microsoft Windows and Linux based systems,\nenhanced encryption settings, a full-fledged and integrated feature built directly into the\nmanagement panel that enabled affiliates to arrange calls meant to pressure victims into\npaying ransoms, and a way to launch a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS).\n\nWith respect to DarkSide’s affiliates, there is overlap in how the ransomware was delivered,\nincluding affiliates gaining initial network access by exploiting vulnerable software like\nCitrix, Remote Desktop Web (RDWeb), or remote desktop protocol (RDP), performing\nlateral movement, and exfiltrating sensitive data before ultimately deploying ransomware.\n\nFor initial access to networks, actors usually purchased access credentials on underground\nforums, conducted brute-force attacks, used spam campaigns to spread malware loaders\nand/or bought access to popular botnets such as Dridex, TrickBot and ZLoader. As for post\n\n-----\n\nexploitation tools, the arsenal usually included Cobalt Strike and Metasploit frameworks,\nMimikatz and BloodHound.\n\nSome of the tactics, techniques and procedures that Intel 471 has observed from DarkSide\naffiliates:\n\nOne prominent actor partnered with network access brokers to source initial access\ncredentials, used the Mega.nz file-sharing service to exfiltrate data from victims,\nleveraged a PowerShell backdoor for reconnaissance and persistence within corporate\nnetworks, and also operating the KPOT information-stealing malware in conjunction\nwith deploying DarkSide.\n\nAnother actor recruited penetration testers to use VPNs in conjunctions alreadyobtained network access, allowing attackers to move laterally within the network,\nexfiltrate sensitive data and deploy ransomware.\n\nDarkSide operators did not take responsibility for the Colonial Pipeline attack or publicly\ndump any data belonging to the company at the time of this report. However, on May 10,\n2021, the group released an announcement alluding to its possible involvement in the attack.\nThe operators pledged in the announcement that they will introduce “moderation” in the\nfuture by carefully checking each company DarkSide affiliates want to encrypt “to avoid\nsocial consequences in the future.” Operators also claimed that the group is strictly motivated\nby money, and not affiliated with any government apparatus.\n\nThis is not the first time DarkSide operators have tried to put PR spin on their actions. In\nOctober, [the group announced on its blog that it would donate a portion of the collected](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-gang-donates-part-of-ransom-demands-to-charity-organizations/)\n[ransoms to Children International, non-profit child sponsorship organization dedicated to](https://www.children.org/)\n[fighting poverty, and The Water Project, a non-profit aiming to provide clean water to](https://thewaterproject.org/)\ncountries in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\"We think it's fair that some of the money they've paid will go to charity,” the entry on the\nblog site read. “No matter how bad you think our work is, we are pleased to know that we\nhelped change someone's life.\"\n\nIt is unknown if DarkSide continued to fund the charities outside of their initial donation.\n\nThe popularity and increasing maturity of the ransomware-as-a-service model combined\nwith the aging systems that control energy systems is a compounding problem. As threat\nactors continue to observe ransomware’s operational success, more cybercriminals likely will\nwant to get in on the action due to its thriving sub-industries (i.e. access brokers, credential\nshops, and bulletproof hosting) and higher returns when compared other crimes (i.e.\ntargeting bank accounts). It’s imperative that companies responsible for critical\ninfrastructure understand that insecure systems present a juicy ransomware target to the\ncybercriminal underground, and proactive defenses will go a long way in preventing future\nincidents like what happened with Colonial Pipeline\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
