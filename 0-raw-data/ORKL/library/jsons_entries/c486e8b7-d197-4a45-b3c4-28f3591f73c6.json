However, these clues, outlined below, may represent a\n[social engineering experiment aimed at manipulating the media, à la Groove.](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/groove-ransomware-media-manipulation/)\n\n## RAMP is now in multiple languages\n\n\n-----\n\nIn October, RAMP administrators made changes to the forum s interface that make it more\naccessible to Chinese-speaking and English-speaking threat actors. Forum sections are now\nin Russian, English, and Mandarin; the main administrator is addressing members in English\nmore often than before; and there is noticeably more English content and comments—and\neven coming from some Russian-speaking actors.\n\nFurthermore, the RAMP authorization form (for account verification) now includes a domain\nfor a Chinese forum among the others.\n\nPreviously, RAMP was a mainly Russian-speaking forum, although English-speaking\nmembers were tolerated.\n\nFounded this summer year in response to top-tier Russian-speaking forums banning ads by\nransomware gangs, and now in its third iteration, RAMP now appears under a new .onion\ndomain and requires former users to re-register.\n\n## Mandarin on illicit communities\n\nIn October, an XSS user replied to a thread with a Chinese-language ad looking for partners\n[in a ransomware operation. Furthermore, in the wake of BlackMatter’s shutdown, the](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/blackmatter-announces-its-end/)\nspokesperson of LockBit invited BlackMatter’s affiliates to move to China where the LockBit\nspokesperson claimed to be residing.\n\nIn the screenshot below, XSS user “hoffman” greets two forum members who revealed\nthemselves as Chinese. The threat actor asks them if they could provide information about\nransomware and purchasing various kinds of system vulnerabilities. The language seems to\nbe machine-translated Chinese.\n\nAccording to RAMP administrators, there are about 30 users of Chinese origin on the forum\nthus far. However, apart from the Chinese-language forum headings, there is no notable\npresence from Chinese-language threat actors. Admins promised to add content for Chinese\nusers soon.\n\n\n-----\n\nNotably, RAMP administrators no longer require proof of membership on Exploit and XSS—\ntwo other top-tier Russian-language illicit forums—to approve registration.\n\n## Flashpoint analysis\n\nWhile it is possible that Russian-speaking ransomware operators may be seeking alliances\noutside of Russia—cooperative cybersecurity talks with the U.S. are currently underway—it\nremains unclear whether RAMP efforts to woo Chinese-speaking threat actors are in fact\nlegitimate or simply a smokescreen.\n\nIn late October 2021, the “Groove” ransomware gang called on other ransomware operators\nto jointly attack US entities; once this generated media attention, the operator of Groove’s\n[public blog claimed that it was a media hack. It is certainly possible that RAMP’s overture to](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/groove-ransomware-media-manipulation/)\nChinese-speaking threat actors is part of a similar strategy.\n\n## Prepare for Ransomware and Cyber Extortion with Flashpoint\n\nData and analysis for this article was discovered directly through analyst research in the\n[Flashpoint platform.
