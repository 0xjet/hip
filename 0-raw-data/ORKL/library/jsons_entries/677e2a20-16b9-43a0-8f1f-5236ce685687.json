This assessment is based on technical and geopolitical indicators. In\nApril 2021, we released **[a public report detailing our high-confidence assessment that UNC1151](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/espionage-group-unc1151-likely-conducts-ghostwriter-influence-activity)**\nprovides technical support to the Ghostwriter information operations campaign; this\nassessment, along with observed Ghostwriter narratives consistent with Belarusian\ngovernment interests, causes us to assess with moderate confidence that Belarus is also likely\nat least partially responsible for the Ghostwriter campaign. We cannot rule out Russian\ncontributions to either UNC1151 or Ghostwriter. However, at this time, we have not uncovered\ndirect evidence of such contributions.\n\n## Cyber Espionage Targeting Most Closely Aligns with Belarusian Government Interests\n\n\n-----\n\ndissidents, media entities, and journalists. While there are multiple intelligence services that\nare interested in these countries, the specific targeting scope is most consistent with\nBelarusian interests. In addition to the targeting scope, UNC1151 operations have focused on\nobtaining confidential information and no monetization efforts have been uncovered.\n\nSince at least 2016, UNC1151 has registered credential theft domains that spoof legitimate\nwebsites to steal victim credentials. Outside of the major American companies that are\nused worldwide (Facebook, Google, Twitter), most spoofed organizations have been in the\nfive countries listed above. This has included regional webmail providers, national and\nlocal governments, and private businesses.\n\nMalware based intrusions have also focused on Eastern Europe. Multiple significant\n\nintrusions into Ukrainian government entities have been conducted by UNC1151. Though\n\nmost of the activity was targeting Ukraine, some targeted Lithuania and Poland.\n\nUNC1151 targeted multiple Belarusian media entities and several members of the political\n\nopposition in Belarus in the year before the 2020 Belarusian election. UNC1151 has\ntargeted media entities in Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine, and Latvia, but we have not seen\n\nsimilar targeting of opposition leaders or domestic political activists in these countries.\nAdditionally, in several cases, individuals targeted by UNC1151 before the 2020 Belarusian\n\nelection were later arrested by the Belarusian government.\n\nThe group has not targeted Russian or Belarusian state entities. It has spear phished\n\nintergovernmental organizations dealing with former-Soviet states, but not their\ngovernments.\n\nWhile the majority of UNC1151 operations have targeted countries neighboring Belarus, a small\nminority have been conducted against governments with no obvious connection to Belarus.\nThere are multiple possible explanations for this targeting, including incidental inclusion on\ndiplomatic mailing lists, or non-public bilateral issues. However, the targeting that does not\nalign directly to Belarusian interests could indicate that UNC1151 also supports additional\npriorities. These out-of-scope operations mainly took place between 2016 and 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Map of UNC1151 Targeting from 2017 to 2020_\n\nHistorical UNC1151 domains have spoofed the websites of entities such as Malta’s\n\nGovernment, Kuwaiti Army (mail.kuwaitarmy.gov-kw.ml), France’s military, and other\n\ntargets that are beyond Belarus’ immediate geographic neighborhood. More recent\nUNC1151 domains have spoofed entities related to high priority targets such as Poland,\n\nLithuania, and Ukraine.\n\nIn June 2019, UNC1151 sent a phish with a malicious attachment to 33 recipients. While the\nmajority were in located in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Ukraine, it was also sent to the\nColombian, Irish and Swiss governments. In addition, multiple credential theft emails have\n\nbeen sent to the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n## Technical Evidence Indicates Operators Located in Minsk, Possible Connection to the Belarusian Government.\n\nSensitively sourced technical evidence indicates that the operators behind UNC1151 are likely\nlocated in Minsk, Belarus. This assessment is based on multiple sources that have linked this\nactivity to individuals located in Belarus. In addition, separate technical evidence supports a link\nbetween the operators behind UNC1151 and the Belarusian military.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese connections have been confirmed with separate sources.\n\n\n## Operational Continuity and No Links to Previously Tracked Groups\n\nMandiant has tracked UNC1151 since 2017, and during this time there have been no overlaps with\nother tracked Russian groups, including APT28, APT29, Turla, Sandworm, and\nTEMP.Armageddon. While we cannot rule out Russian support for or involvement in UNC1151 or\nGhostwriter operations, the TTPs used by UNC1151 are unique to this group.\n\nSandworm Team has conducted significant credential theft operations during the time\nUNC1151 has been active, but the techniques used have been distinct. While UNC1151\nprimarily sent phishes impersonating security notices, Sandworm team has leveraged\nwatering holes designed to redirect users to spoofed login websites.\n\nTEMP.Armageddon has conducted extensive targeting of multiple Ukrainian entities\n\nduring the time UNC1151 has been actively targeting Ukraine. The two groups appear to act\nwithout knowledge of the other and do not share any malware, infrastructure, or other\nresources.\n\nWe continue to assess that Ghostwriter activity is distinct from other information\n\noperations campaigns such as Secondary Infektion.\n\nSince 2017, UNC1151 operations have leveraged evolving but contiguous TTPs. This\nevolution is consistent with the maturation of a single organization, and we have not\nuncovered any evidence of a discontinuity in operators.\n\n## Ghostwriter Operations Aligned with Narrower Belarusian Interests Since Mid-2020\n\nPre-2020 Ghostwriter information operations were primarily anti-NATO, but since mid-2020\nthey have focused on Belarus’ neighbors.\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the earliest observed Ghostwriter operation until mid-2020, the Ghostwriter campaign\nprimarily promoted anti-NATO narratives that appeared intended to undercut regional security\ncooperation in operations targeting Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland. To this end, observed\noperations have disseminated disinformation portraying the foreign troop presence in the\nregion as a threat to residents and alleging that the costs of NATO membership are a detriment\nto local populations. The seeming intended effect of these narratives—to erode regional support\nfor NATO—can serve both Russian and Belarusian interests. We note, however, that the\ncampaign has specifically targeted audiences in countries bordering Belarus, whereas Russia\nhas long promoted anti-NATO narratives both in the region and further afield. Specifically,\nobserved Ghostwriter operations, in this time period and through the present, have almost\ncompletely excluded Estonia, which notably does not border Belarus but is a Baltic State, NATO\nmember, and a relevant component of any concerns about NATO’s security posture on its\neastern flank.\n\nTwenty-two out of 24 observed Ghostwriter operations conducted prior to mid-2020\npromoted narratives that were either directly critical of NATO—including allegations of the\ndeployment of nuclear weapons, NATO troops spreading COVID-19, and crimes committed\n\nby NATO troops—or otherwise critical of the presence of foreign troops from allied\nmember states.\n\nTwo additional operations conducted during this period promoted narratives that\nappeared intended to create controversy in Lithuanian domestic political affairs.\n\nSince the disputed August 2020 elections in Belarus, Ghostwriter operations have been more\ndistinctly aligned with Minsk’s interests. Promoted narratives have focused on alleging\ncorruption or scandal within the ruling parties in Lithuania and Poland, attempting to create\ntensions in Polish-Lithuanian relations, and discrediting the Belarusian opposition. Both\ngovernments have strongly condemned the Lukashenka regime’s crackdown on demonstrations\nand extraordinary efforts to stay in power. In addition, several Ghostwriter operations have\npromoted narratives specific to Belarus, including narratives critical of alleged Polish\ngovernment support for Belarusian dissidents. It is possible that operations seemingly intended\nto undermine local confidence in the Lithuanian and Polish governments are a response to what\nBelarus has claimed to be their intervention in Belarusian domestic affairs. Likewise, operations\nseemingly intended to create tensions between the two nations may be an attempt to undercut\ntheir cooperation, which has in part characterized their responses to Belarus-related issues.\n\nIn August 2020, Ghostwriter personas published articles that portrayed the protests in\n\nBelarus as orchestrated by the U.S. and NATO, claiming that NATO is willing to intervene\nmilitarily on behalf of the protestors and arguing that the West should refrain from\ninterfering in the \"internal affairs\" of Belarus.\n\nAdditionally, Ghostwriter operations have promoted narratives that seem designed in part\n\nto suggest foreign interference in Belarus, primarily from Poland and Lithuania.\n\nSince the August 2020 elections 16 out of 19 Ghostwriter operations promoted narratives\n\n\n-----\n\nSome operations targeting Poland and Lithuania have promoted narratives with\n\n\nconnections to regional disputes involving Belarus. For example, multiple operations have\nalleged that accidents had occurred at Lithuanian nuclear power facilities. Lithuania has\nactively opposed the construction and operation of Belarus’s Astravyets nuclear power\nplant, which is located near the Lithuanian border. Likewise, an August 2021 Ghostwriter\n\noperation targeting Poland and Lithuania promoted a narrative about a fabricated crime\ncommitted by migrants, while Poland and Lithuania were accusing Belarus of\norchestrating an outflow of migrants from its borders.\n\nWe have observed some dissemination of these narratives in Russian by what we assess\nto be campaign assets. The promotion of Ghostwriter narratives in Russian suggests that\nthey are in some way also intended to influence Russian-speaking audiences.\n\nGhostwriter narratives, particularly those critical of neighboring governments, have been\nfeatured on Belarusian state television as fact. We are unable to ascertain whether this is part\nof a coordinated strategy or if it is simply Belarusian state TV promoting narratives that are\nconsistent with regime interest and being unconcerned with accuracy. Such television\nprograms suggest that some Ghostwriter operations’ promoted narratives are particularly\nrelevant to the ongoing internal political conversation in Belarus, and it raises the possibility\nthat discrediting rival governments and Belarusian opposition figures in the eyes of the\nBelarusian public may be an additional goal of the Ghostwriter campaign.\n\nWe have observed multiple instances of Ghostwriter narratives discrediting the Polish\ngovernment promoted on Belarusian state-owned TV news. The TV reports have featured\nallegedly leaked Polish government communications and documents that were promoted\nin a hack-and-leak style Ghostwriter operation that began in June 2021. They also\nspecifically highlighted narratives that news programs framed as documenting Polish\nsupport for the Belarusian opposition. In one instance, a Belarusian TV news report even\ncited by name a Russian-language Telegram channel that we believe to be a Ghostwriter\n\nasset as its source.\n\nWe have additionally observed pro-Belarusian government Telegram channels regularly\nrepost or cite a Russian-language Telegram channel that we have attributed to\nGhostwriter.\n\n## Uncertainty around Malware Development and Information Operations Content\n\nThe sources of written content for Ghostwriter operations and of the malware used by UNC1151\nremain uncertain. The creation of content for information operations, especially in multiple\nlanguages, requires a distinct skillset from conducting computer intrusions. Likewise, the\ndevelopment of custom malware requires software engineering skills that are distinct from\n\n\n-----\n\nBelarus; however, the uncertainty and distinct skillsets required for different aspects of this\nactivity creates a possibility for the involvement of additional organizations or countries.\n\nGhostwriter information operations have published content in English, Lithuanian, Polish,\nLatvian, Ukrainian, Russian, and German.\n\nWe have determined that UNC1151 uses GoPhish primarily for their email sending\noperations – including both cyber espionage and Ghostwriter content dissemination. They\noften spoof the from envelope of the emails and previously leveraged email delivery\nservices such as SMTP2GO to legitimize themselves. Technical details from early UNC1151\ncampaigns suggest that the group was unfamiliar with these technologies and may have\nlearned on the job how to use them properly.\n\nUNC1151 uses credential harvesting domains attempting to spoof legitimate webmail\nproviders, generic login pages, and the legitimate websites of their targets. These\ncredential harvesting domains are sent to victims via phishing email. Over time, UNC1151\ndomain registration TTPs have shifted. Early domain registration TTPs looked similar to,\nbut did not technically overlap with, clusters of credential harvesting domains we\nattributed to Russian threat groups. Notably the group has shifted away from using\n\nFreenom and towards using Cloudflare services, which may be reflective of increased\nresources being available to the group.\n\nUNC1151 has used a proprietary suite of malware, including HIDDENVALUE, and\nHALFSHELL, and has infrequently been observed using open source or publicly available\n\ntools. Though we have observed the use of these early-stage foothold malware families,\nwe have yet to see post-compromise activity.\n\nUNC1151 has improved in its technical skill since we began tracking the group. UNC1151\nmalware families are commonly .NET applications with basic command functionality. We\nhave not seen any code overlap between these malware families, though supported\n\ncommands appear to be similar at a high level. We have observed variants of\nHIDDENVALUE which support slightly different sets of commands. Prior to HIDDENVALUE,\nwhich has been used in several different operations targeting Ukraine and Poland,\nmalware families used by UNC1151 may have been used for limited sets of operations.\n\n## Attribution Summary\n\nMandiant assesses with high confidence that UNC1151 is linked to the Belarusian government\nand with moderate confidence is linked to the Belarusian military. This is based on the below\nfactors:\n\nThe countries targeted by the majority of UNC1151 operations have strained bilateral\n\n\n-----\n\nMinistries of Defense are the most common government entities targeted by UNC1151,\nsuggesting a military intelligence focus for the group.\n\nIndividual targets, including individuals who are part of the Belarusian opposition and\nmedia are of most interest to Belarus.\n\nSensitive technical information locates the operation in Minsk, Belarus and links it to the\nBelarusian Military.\n\nUNC1151 has conducted operations without a clear, direct link to Belarusian priorities.\nHowever, these are a minority of operations and are plausibly explained by multiple\nfactors.\n\nMandiant assesses with high confidence that Ghostwriter information operations are conducted\nin support of the Belarusian government and with moderate confidence that they are conducted\nwith Belarusian sponsorship.\n\nThe operations conducted since the disputed Belarusian elections in 2020 have\nconformed to specific parochial Belarusian government goals and align with the overt\n\nactions taken by Belarus against Lithuania and Poland.\n\nThe close technical links between UNC1151 and the Ghostwriter campaign suggest a high\nlikelihood of a shared sponsor.\n\nHowever, we lack insight into the generation of the information operations’ content.\n\nMandiant has examined the possibility of Russian participation in UNC1151 and Ghostwriter\noperations, but we do not have su�cient evidence to confirm or refute a role in these activities.\nMandiant has seen high level TTP overlaps with Russian operations and much of the targeting\nand information operations are consistent with Russian goals. Given the close ties between the\ngovernments, collaboration is plausible; however, we have not uncovered direct evidence of\nRussian government involvement.\n\nUNC1151’s initial focus on NATO’s reputation in the Baltics is also a goal of Russia. However,\nthe operations focuses in Lithuania and Latvia, which border Belarus, and were not\nuncovered in Estonia, which does not.\n\nRussia has significant offensive cyber and information operations expertise that could\nhave supported the operation.\n\n## Outlook and Implications\n\nBelarusian sponsorship of UNC1151 and the links to the Ghostwriter operations showcases the\naccessibility and deniability of provocative information operations. While the cyber espionage\n\n\n-----\n\noperations are a one of many tools that governments use to accomplish their goals, and do not\nexist in a vacuum, but are leveraged alongside other types of operations.\n\n**YOUR CYBERSECURITY ADVANTAGE**\n\n**[CUSTOMERS](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)** **[PARTNERS](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)**\n\n\n**[Support](https://www.mandiant.com/support)**\n\n**[Community](https://community.fireeye.com/)**\n\n\n**[Mandiant Partners](https://www.mandiant.com/partners/mandiant-partners)**\n\n**[Service Partners](https://www.mandiant.com/partners/service-partners)**\n\n**[Cyber Risk Partners](https://www.mandiant.com/partners/cyber-risk-partners)**\n\n**[Technology Partners](https://www.mandiant.com/partners/technology-partners)**\n\n**[Partner Portal](https://partners.fireeye.com/English/)**\n\n\n**[COMPANY](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)** **[PRODUCTS AND S ERVIC ES](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)**\n\n\n**[About Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/company)**\n\n**[Media Center](https://www.mandiant.com/company/media-center)**\n\n**[Careers](https://careers.smartrecruiters.com/mandiant/all/)**\n\n**[CONNECT WITH MANDIANT](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)**\n\n\n**[Advantage Platform](https://www.mandiant.com/advantage)**\n\n**[Managed Defense](https://www.mandiant.com/advantage/managed-defense)**\n\n**[Mandiant Services](https://www.mandiant.com/services)**\n\n**[Mandiant Academy](https://www.mandiant.com/advantage/academy)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Report An Incident](https://www.mandiant.com/report-incident)**\n\n**[Email Preferences](https://www.mandiant.com/email-preferences)**\n\n\n**Cookie Preferences**\n\n\n-----",
