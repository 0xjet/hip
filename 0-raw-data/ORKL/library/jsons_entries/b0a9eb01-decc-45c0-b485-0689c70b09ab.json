It’s a technique reminiscent of vishing_\n_and tech support scams where potential victims are being cold called by the attacker,_\n_except in BazarCall’s case, targeted users must dial the number. And when they do, the_\n_users are connected with actual humans on the other end of the line, who then provide_\n_step-by-step instructions for installing malware into their devices._\n\n\n-----\n\nBazarCall campaigns first came into the limelight in late 2020 and since then Trellix has\nseen a constant increase in attacks pertaining to this campaign. It was initially found to be\n[delivering BazaarLoader (backdoor) which was used as an entry point to deliver](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.bazarbackdoor)\nransomware. For those interested in more details about BazaarLoader, [this article by “The](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/09/13/bazarloader-to-conti-ransomware-in-32-hours/)\nDFIR Report” contains a comprehensive explanation on how a BazaarLoader infection led\nto the installation of Conti Ransomware in a span of 32 hours. As the BazarCall campaign\ngrew, it was also found to be delivering other malware such as Trickbot, Gozi IFSB, IcedID\nand more.\n\nWhat we find particularly interesting is the evolution of the social engineering tactics of\nBazarCall. With the growth in cyberattacks, people are increasingly aware of the common\ntactics used by adversaries. As awareness has improved, BazarCall has ceaselessly\nadapted and evolved its social engineering tactics accordingly.\n\n[These linked articles by Palo Alto Networks and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/bazarloader-malware/) [Bleeping Computer can be referred to get](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bazarcall-malware-uses-malicious-call-centers-to-infect-victims/)\ninformation on the attack flow of some of the BazarCall campaigns.\n\nFigure. 1: Attack Chain\n\n### Analyzing the evolution\n\nUsing emails obtained by Trellix Email Security, our researchers contacted various call\ncenters to learn about different techniques and tactics utilized by attackers. Based on the\nanalysis, Trellix was able to generalize the attack flow of the BazarCall campaigns and\ncategorize the same into three phases. The study also revealed the evolution of the social\n\n\n-----\n\nengineering tactics which was particularly noticed in the call center scripts used by the\nscammers to trick victims into downloading and installing malware in their system, the\nscammers are now found to be utilizing many different types of conversation scripts.\n\nLet us dive into more details and go through the distinct phases of the attack.\n\n### Phase 1 - The bait\n\nThe delivery vector is a fake notification email which informs the recipient about a charge\nlevied on their account for purchase/renewal of a product/subscription. It contains all the\ngeneric information like Product Name, Date, Model, etc. along with a unique invoice\nnumber used by the scammer to identify the victim. In addition, the email states that the\nvictim can call the phone number for any queries or cancellation requests. In different\nvariants, the information was found to be present in the email body or as a PDF attachment.\n\nThe campaign was seen impersonating many brands like Geek Squad, Norton, McAfee,\nPayPal, Microsoft etc. (listed in the order of popularity).\n\nThe following screenshots are some sample emails and attachments which were detected\nby Trellix Email Security being distributed in the wild.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure. 2: Sample emails\n\n### Phase 2 - The attack\n\nOnce the recipient calls the scam call center the trickiest phase of the attack begins:\nmanipulating the victim into downloading and running malware on their system.\n\n\n-----\n\nBazarCall employs many different tactics to achieve this. We will now go into greater detail\non the conversation script categories.\n\n### The (dis)honest guy\n\nThis tactic begins with the scammer asking victim for basic details like invoice number,\nphone number, email address etc. Following which, the scammer takes a pause and\npretends to check his system to find any invoice relative to the details shared by the victim\nand then conveys that no invoice could be found. The scammer suggests that the email\nreceived by the victim is a spam email and should be ignored.\n\nThe scammer then queries victim to know if their system is slow or if they are facing any\nother issues with it, adding to which the scammer suggests that victim’s system might be\naffected with a malware which would have caused them to receive the spam email. He then\noffers to schedule a call back where an executive can scan and check the victim’s system\nand resolve any issues.\n\nThe next call begins with the scammer asking the name of the operating system which the\nvictim is using. Following the answer, the scammer asks the victim to open a specific URL\nwhich is a malicious website masqueraded to look like a customer support website. The\nscammer then asks the victim to enter a code on the website to download a file which he\nclaims to be an anti-virus software. As an additional tactic to make the call sound more\nauthentic, the scammer asks the victim to keep a note of the code for verification purposes.\nFinally, the scammer asks the victim to execute the downloaded file to run the scan on their\nsystem.\n\n### The (fake) incident responder\n\nThis tactic was found to be used in PayPal themed BazarCall campaigns. It begins with the\nscammer asking the victim for the details like invoice number, debited amount etc. The\nscammer then asks if the victim uses PayPal, on answering “Yes,” the scammer then asks\nfor the email ID which is linked to their PayPal account.\n\nThe scammer then pretends to check the information related to the victim’s PayPal account\nand states that the account has been accessed from 8 (or any random high number)\ndevices. The scammer asks if all these devices belong to the victim and just like anyone\nwould, the victim gets alarmed. The scammer then asks victim about their current location,\nfollowing the answer the scammer informs the victim that their account was accessed from\na suspicious location, the scammer would then name any random location which is far from\nthe victim’s current location.\n\n\n-----\n\nNow, something which we found amusing and interesting, the scammer asks the victim to\nsearch “What's my IP” on Google and suggests that if the result has a title as “your public\nIP address,” that means the connection is public and hence insecure. The scammer then\nsuggests that to secure the connection, the victim would need to open a particular website.\nThe final step is like the above case, where the scammer asks the victim to download and\nexecute a file.\n\n### The over compensator\n\nJust like the other categories, this tactic also begins with the scammer asking for basic\ndetails and pretending to check their system for the same. The scammer then confirms that\nthe amount has been deducted from the victim’s account for the security (or any other)\nproduct. He then asks the victim if they would want to cancel the subscription and if the\nvictim says “Yes,” the scammer explains the importance of security software to the victim\nand would ask if the victim still wants to proceed with the cancellation.\n\nThis is used as a tactic to make the call sound authentic by convincing the victim that the\ncaller is motivated to sell the subscription for the security product and is rather not\ndesperate to proceed for cancellation. The scammer then states that the victim needs to be\nconnected to a support agent to complete the cancellation and receive a refund. As an\nadditional tactic to gain trust, the scammer repeatedly asks the victim to not share any\nsensitive information with him as the call is being recorded and the company policy does\nnot allow him to ask for any sensitive information from the customer. The final step is like\nthe above case, where the scammer asks the victim to download and execute a file.\n\n### The (terr/sens)ible one\n\nThis tactic was found to be used in the “security subscription renewal” themed campaigns.\nThis also begins with the scammer asking for some basic details and pretending to find\ninformation related to it. The scammer then explains to the victim that the charge has been\nlevied on their account because the security product that came pre-installed with their\nlaptop has expired and has hence been automatically renewed to continue the security\nprotection for the device.\n\nThe scammer then asks the victim if they would like to continue with their security\nsubscription or cancel it. As the victim requests to cancel the subscription, the scammer\nqueries if the victim has any other security solution present on their system. This is also a\ntrust-gaining tactic where the scammer pretends to be interested in the security of the\nvictim’s system. The scammer then states that the victim needs to be connected to the\ncancellation server to complete the cancellation process and receive a refund. Here too, the\nfinal step is like the other cases, where the scammer asks the victim to download and\nexecute a file.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_The Relevance of the Invoice ID_**\n\nYou must have noticed that all variants of the campaign began with the scammer asking for\nthe Invoice ID from the victim. That is because each Invoice ID is uniquely generated for\nevery email. When the victim provides the Invoice ID to the scammer, the scammer\nsearches for the same in their database and if found, the scammer can use details related\nto the Invoice ID in order to pretend to already have victim’s details like name, email\naddress, amount debited, etc. This gives an impression of authenticity to the victim and\nhelps to convince him into downloading and running the malware.\n\nThe following are some examples of the fake support websites found by Trellix Email\nSecurity which are being used in BazarCall campaigns to deliver the malware.\n\nFigure. 3: Sample support sites\n\n### Phase 3 - The kill\n\nOnce the malware is executed, then begins the third phase of the attack where the malware\nis used to conduct financial fraud or push additional malware to the system.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the analysis by researchers from Trellix, the majority of BazarCall campaigns\nutilize a file name like “support.Client.exe” and the following is an example of such a file\nspotted by our researchers:\n\nName\n\nSupport.Client.exe\n\nSize\n\n85.70 KB\n\nFile-Type\n\nWin32 EXE\n\nSHA 256\n\nead2b47848758a91466c91bed2378de1253d35db3505b5f725c289468d24645b\n\nSHA 1\n\nbc664ec8dff62f5793af24f6ca013e29498062f2\n\nMD5\n\n1e88b21d4c7d51f312337b477167ed25\n\nOn executing, the file connects to a malicious domain (in this case healthcenter[.]cc) and\ndownloads a ClickOnce Security and Deployment Application file with “.application”\nextension. ClickOnce is a deployment technology that allows to create self-updating\nWindows-based applications that can be installed and run with minimal user interaction, you\n[can read more about it here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-security-and-deployment?view=vs-2022)\n\nThe malware then follows to drop multiple files on the victim’s system that are required for\nproper execution of the malware. The dropped files are found to be for ScreenConnect\nsoftware which is a legitimate remote-control software by ConnectWise. Adversaries,\nhowever, have been utilizing ScreenConnect for many years as a part of the attack chain\nwhere to drop spyware, ransomware, etc. BazarCall campaigns have also been consistent\nwith the use of ScreenConnect for more than a year.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the malware completes downloading the dependencies, it executes and the scammer\ngains remote access to the victim’s system. The attacker can also show a fake lock screen\nand make the system inaccessible to the victim, where the attacker is able to perform tasks\nwithout the victim being aware about them.the fourth page was the actual REvil backend\npanel as shared by the source.\n\nIn one such case noticed by Trellix, the scammer opens a Fake Cancellation Form behind\nthe lock screen and then asks the victim to fill out the form that requires generic details like\nname, address, email, etc. On submitting the form, the victim receives a success message\nsaying the refund is being processed and they should log into their bank account and\naccept the refund.\n\nFigure 4:\n\nFake cancellation form\n\nThe scammer then asks the victim to login into their bank account to complete the refund\nprocess where the scammer would manipulate the victim into sending money to the\nscammer by making it look like as if the victim is receiving the amount. This is achieved by\nlocking the victim’s screen and initiating a transfer-out request and then unlocking the\nscreen when the transaction requires an OTP (One Time Password) or a secondary\npassword. The victim is also presented with a fake refund successful page to convince him\ninto believing that they have received the refund. The scammer may also send an SMS to\nthe victim with a fake money received message as an additional tactic to prevent the victim\nfrom suspecting any fraud.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe above example only presents one of the many directions the attack can lead to, the\nattacker might also use the remote access to install additional malwares in the victim’s\nsystem to gain a persistent access to victim’s system which can be then used to spy on the\nactivities, exfiltrate data, steal credentials or install a ransomware on the system.\n\n### Infection map\n\nThe BazarCall campaigns were found to be most active in United States and Canada. They\nwere also seen targeting some Asian countries like India and China.\n\nFigure 5: Infection map\n\n### Trellix protection\n\nTrellix Email security provides reliable detection from BazarCall campaigns by preventing\nsuch emails from ever reaching your system.
