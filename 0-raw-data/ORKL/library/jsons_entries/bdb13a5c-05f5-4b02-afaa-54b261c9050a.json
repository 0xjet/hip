It uses strong encryption algorithms to ensure the data\nremains secure from attackers. However, it can also be used to encrypt, obfuscate, or\nmanipulate malware to make it harder for AV’s to detect. In this blog we review the\nScrubCrypter and its origin, where threat actors can easily buy the Crypter, and how\nattackers use phishing campaigns to distribute the Crypter and its accompanying malware.\n\n## What is ScrubCrypt?\n\n[ScrubCrypt is a Crypter currently sold on HackForums, a hacking forum in the clear web, that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearnet_(networking))\nanyone can access from their device.\n\nThe price of the Crypter is 40 USD for a monthly subscription and goes up to 200 USD for a\nlifetime subscription.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: ScrubCrypt pricing plan_\n\nThe seller of the Crypter “Scrubspoof” provides a list of Crypter features, which include:\n\nAES Encryption\nAnti VM/Debug\nPersistence mechanism\n\n_Figure 2: ScrubCrypt feature list_\n\nThe seller describes the Crypter as an “antivirus evasion tool [that] converts executables into\nundetectable batch files”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: ScrubCrypt value proposition_\n\nCustomers can leave a review about the Crypter in the HackForum post thread. One\ninteresting comment we stumbled upon was as follows:\n\n_Figure 4: Prospective customer comment_\n\nThis comment was made by a confused potential customer that managed to identify the\nsimilarity between ScrubCrypter and the well known Jlaive Crypter. The Jlaive Crypter has\nbeen used for a long time by many threat actors as their main Crypter of choice.\n\nEventually, the main developer of the Jlaive Crypter replied to the user:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Jlaive Crypter developer response_\n\nThe developer’s response was confirmation that ScrubCrypter is just a renamed version of\nthe Jlaive Crypter. While other customers claim that ScrubCrypter has better performance\nthan Jlaive, the features and functions are nearly identical. With a Crypter so easily available\nand accessible, any malicious actor can buy it and use it to propagate malware or the actor’s\nattack of choice. This threatens the overall security of many organizations, as the Crypter\nhides the final payload, making it less detectable to even some advanced security systems.\n\nNow that we have covered what ScrubCrypt is and how easy it is to access, let’s investigate\nhow it can be used in a real-world example.\n\n## The Crypt Goes Phish\n\nIn this example that Perception Point’s advanced threat detection platform caught, a\ncustomer received a seemingly typical phishing email. However, upon further review there is\nmore to this email than just meets the subject line.\n\nThe user receives an email with the subject: “LEP/RFQ/AV/04/2022/6030”. Upon opening the\nmessage, there is a generic body with keywords often employed in social engineering\ncampaigns. he goal of the message is to convince the user to download the attachment.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: The phishing email_\n\nWhen the user downloads the attached file, it leads to a .bat file (batch script), which, once\nexecuted by the user, leads to a multi-stage execution chain.\n\n_Figure 7: .bat File_\n\n\n-----\n\nThis eventually unleashes the Xworm RAT. Xworm RAT is a brand new Remote Access\nTrojan written in .NET language. Like any other RAT, it begins by stealing the user’s basic\ninformation like their country, IP address, operating system, etc. From there, it connects to\nthe C2 server, allowing the threat actor to employ a variety of commands like keylogging,\nremote control of the user’s mouse, and downloading ransomware.\n\nBy using the Crypter to send this attachment, it makes it more difficult for security systems to\ndetect. The Crypter adds a layer of protection to the malicious file, supposedly ensuring that\nthe attacker will gain access to the user’s system or network.\n\nPerception Point’s advanced threat detection platform flagged this message as malicious.\nThe platform was able to recognize the sender’s low reputation and lack of a known\nconnection to the user. In addition, the platform identified that the attachment was an archive\nfile, which contained an executable that prompted an automatic download on the user’s\noperating system.\n\n## Summary\n\nAttackers using a Crypter to hide malicious files poses a major security concern for all\norganizations, regardless of industry. The accessibility and availability of this specific\nScrubCrypt makes it all the more dangerous, as attackers can easily purchase it and use it to\nconduct widespread attack campaigns. Without the necessary security features, an individual\ncould open a ScrubCrypt file and unknowingly impact their entire organization, thus leading\nto irreparable damages.\n\nIn this blog we outlined the origins and uses of a Crypter. In subsequent blogs we will explore\nand expand upon the Crypter itself and the attack chain of Xworm RAT malware.\n\n### IOCs\n\nLEPRFQAV04,pdf.001 –\n28d6b3140a1935cd939e8a07266c43c0482e1fea80c65b7a49cf54356dcb58bc\n(Sha256)\nLEPRFQAV04,pdf.bat –\n04ce543c01a4bace549f6be2d77eb62567c7b65edbbaebc0d00d760425dcd578\n(Sha256)\n\n[All IOCs found by PerceptionPoint can be found on MalwareBazzar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/tag/PerceptionPoint/)\n\n\n-----",
