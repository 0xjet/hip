Unlike\ntraditional ransomware campaigns where the motive is obvious, this campaign is believed\nto be pseudo in nature. In other words, the intention is likely to cause destruction of infected\nsystems since the wiper at stage 4 simply overwrites data on the victim’s system, meaning\n\n\n-----\n\nno decryption is possible. The malicious software drops a fake ransomware note while\noverwriting the master boot record in the background. The ransom note contains a Bitcoin\naddress to send the ransom payment and contains a Tox ID to contact the threat actor. The\ninfection process is carried out using the publicly available Impacket tool.\n\nWhile the WhisperGate malware was initially detected in attacks against Ukraine, additional\ndetections have started to be seen across the globe. The Trellix Advanced Threat Research\nTeam has put together the following analysis of WhisperGate.\n\n**Figure 1. Global Prevalence of WhisperGate. Source: MVISION Insights**\n\n**Recommended Steps to Mitigate against WhisperGate**\n\nThe advisory released by the CISA provides several recommendations to secure your\nenvironment against WhisperGate that were gathered from their analysis of malware\nsamples discovered in the wild.\n\nValidate that all remote access to the organization’s network and privileged or\nadministrative access requires multi-factor authentication.\n\n\n-----\n\nEnsure that software is up to date, prioritizing updates that address vulnerabilities\nbeing exploited.\nDisable all ports and protocols that are not essential for business purposes.\nEnsure that Cloud Service security controls have been reviewed and implemented.\n\n[CISA: Implement Cybersecurity Measures Now to Protect Against Potential Critical Threats](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Insights-Implement_Cybersecurity_Measures_Now_to_Protect_Against_Critical_Threats_508C.pdf)\n\n**Open-Source Tools Being Observed in Attacks**\n\nAn open-source tool being observed in attacks using WhisperGate is Impacket. Impacket is\na collection of Python scripts that can be used by an attacker to target Windows network\nprotocols. This tool can be used to enumerate users, capture hashes, move laterally and\nescalate privileges. Impacket has also been used by APT groups, in particular Wizard\nSpider and Stone Panda.\n\nIn the observed intrusions related to WhisperGate, the malware executes via Impacket to\nassist threat actors in lateral movement and execution.\n\n**Figure 2. Tool Description and Campaigns Utilizing Impacket. Source: MVISION**\n**Insights**\n\n**Trellix Protections and Global Detections**\n\nTrellix Global Threat Intelligence is currently detecting all known analyzed indicators for this\ncampaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Blocking WhisperGate Attacks with Endpoint Security**\n\nTrellix ENS is currently detecting WhisperGate IOCs from the standpoint of signature\ndetections and the malware behavior associated with WhisperGate activity.\n\n**Figure 3. Story Graph summary of WhisperGate activity within ENS shown in**\n**MVISION ePO**\n\n**WhisperGate Threat Intelligence from the Trellix Advanced Threat Research Team**\n**and MVISION Insights**\n\nMVISION Insights will provide the current threat intelligence and known indicators for\nWhisperGate. MVISION Insights will alert to detections and Process Traces that have been\nobserved and systems that require additional attention to prevent widespread infection.\n\n\n-----\n\nMVISION Insights will also include Hunting Rules for threat hunting and further intelligence\ngathering of the threat activity and adversary.\n\n**Campaign Name: Ukrainian Organizations Targeted with Destructive Malware**\n\n**Figure 4. Analyzed Indicators with Detections. Source: MVISION Insights**\n\n**Figure 5. Process Trace of WhisperGate Activity. Source: MVISION Insights**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6. Hunting Rules for WhisperGate in MVISION Insights**\n\n**Detecting Malicious Activity with MVISION EDR**\n\nMVISION EDR is currently alerting to the activity associated with WhisperGate and will note\nthe MITRE techniques and any suspicious indicators related to the adversary activity.\n\n**Figure 7. Threat Behavior and Process Activity for WhisperGate shown in MVISION**\n**EDR**\n\n**Securing Cloud Services Against Attacks with MVISION Cloud**\n\nOne of the recommendations by the CISA to mitigate against WhisperGate attacks is to\nensure that cloud services and infrastructure are configured properly, and vulnerabilities\npatched. The Cloud Security controls provided in MVISION Cloud/UCE allow for\n\n\n-----\n\nvulnerability scans and configuration audits of your cloud environment. Identifying areas of\nrisks are critical to not allowing adversaries to gain initial access.\n\n**Figure 8. Vulnerability Scan Violations for AWS shown in MVISION UCE**\n\n**Figure 9. Configuration Audit Incidents for Azure shown in MVISION UCE**\nTrellix offers Threat Intelligence Briefings along with Cloud Security and Data Protection\nworkshops to provide customers with best practice recommendations on how to utilize their\nexisting security controls to protect against adversarial and insider threats, please reach out\nif you would like to schedule a workshop with your organization.\n\n### Featured Content\n\n\n-----\n\nPERSPECTIVES\n\n### Our CEO On Living Security\n\nBy [Bryan Palma · January 19, 2022](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/contributors/bryan-palma.html)\n\nTrellix CEO, Bryan Palma, explains the critical need for security that’s always learning.\n\n[Read More](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/perspectives/our-ceo-on-living-security.html)\n\nXDR\n\n### Time to Drive Change by Challenging the Challengers\n\nBy [Michelle Salvado · January 19, 2022](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/contributors/michelle-salvado.html)\n\nDynamic threats call for dynamic security – the path to resiliency lies in XDR.\n\n[Read More](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/xdr/time-to-drive-change-by-challenging-the-challengers.html)\n\nTHREAT LABS\n\n### 2022 Threat Predictions\n\nBy Trellix · January 19, 2022\n\nWhat cyber security threats should enterprises look out for in 2022?\n\n[Read More](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/threat-labs/2022-threat-predictions.html)\n\n## Get the latest\n\nWe’re no strangers to cybersecurity.
