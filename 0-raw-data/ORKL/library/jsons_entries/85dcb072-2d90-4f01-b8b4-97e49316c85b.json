    "plain_text": "# New Mustang Panda’s campaing against Australia\n\n**[lab52.io/blog/new-mustang-pandas-campaing-against-australia/](https://lab52.io/blog/new-mustang-pandas-campaing-against-australia/)**\n\nAUKUS (Australia-United Kingdom-United States) is a strategic military alliance between\nthese territories that became a reality in 2021, whose main objective is to build nuclearpowered submarines to counter the threat from China in the Indo-Pacific region. This\nagreement also includes the sharing of cyber capabilities and other submarine technologies.\nSome sources point out that this is not a security pact, but is rather intended to “elevate the\nintelligence and deterrence value of conventional capabilities”.\n\nThe key facts of this alliance are as follows:\n\nThe US pledged to invest $4.6 billion in the deal. Australia, for its part, will buy at least\nthree second-hand submarines from the US early in the next decade. However, the US\nCongress has yet to approve this transaction. In addition, Australia will build a fleet of\neight nuclear submarines. The first of these is expected to be ready in 2042.\n\nThis partnership has upset both France and China. Australia will terminate the contract\nawarded to France to build 12 diesel-electric submarines. The importance of these\nsubmarines is reflected in their capabilities: compared to traditional submarines, they\nhave a longer range, are harder to detect, can remain submerged for months and have\na greater carrying capacity. However, they are larger, which is why nuclear submarines\nare more vulnerable to attack from the surface.\n\nLast year, China called the deal “destabilising” and “provocative”. Mao Ning,\nspokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry, said at a press conference on 9th March\nthat Australia is contributing to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, is promoting an\narms race and that this agreement only destabilises the Asia-Pacific region. In addition,\nChina issued the following threat: “Australian troops are also more likely to be the first\ngroup of Western soldiers to waste their lives in the South China Sea”.\n\nThe Lab52 team has already detected the possibility that actors associated with China,\nespecially Mustang Panda, could carry out attacks against the Australian government,\nnotifying its clients.\n\nLab52 has found a zip file named Biography of Senator the Hon Don Farrell.zip. Hon Don\nFarrell is the current Australian Secretary of State for Trade and Tourism, indicating a\ntargeted campaign against Australia.\n\n\n-----\n\nIllustration 1 Senator Hon Don Farrell’s profile\nThe zip drops two files. On the one hand, the legitimate application for process pdf files\nSolid PDF Creator, renamed as “Biography of Senator the Hon Don Farrell/Biography of\n_Senator the Hon Don Farrell.exe”, on the other hand, we have seen a malicious payload_\nnamed SolidPDFCreator.dll. Persistence is done through a Dll Side Loading by the stager.\n\n_Illustration 2 Stage activity_\nC:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\cmd.exe /C copy SolidPDFCreator.dll\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\PhotoTvRHD\\SolidPDFCreator.dll & reg add\n“HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” /v SolidPDF /t\nreg_sz /d “C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\PhotoTvRHD\\SolidPDFCreator.exe” /F & schtasks /F\n/Create /TN SolidPDF /SC minute /MO 1 /TR\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\PhotoTvRHD\\SolidPDFCreator.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter that, the stager tries to impersonate common Microsoft update communications,\n[hardconding a legitimate host header www.asia.microsoft.com, which, in fact, is requesting](http://www.asia.microsoft.com/)\nagainst 123.253.35[.]231 as C2.\n\nIllustration 3 Stage request\nIt is worth noting that it does not download the PlugX malware in the first instance, as usual,\nbut, similar to what has been reported previously by Talos Intelligence [1] or Cisco [2], it uses\na custom-developed stager, subsequently providing the attacker with a reverse shell for a\nPlugX deployment.\n\nAs can be seen, China has developed cyber capabilities that allow it to respond quickly to\nany geopolitical event that might affect its interests. The AUKUS treaty has been a regional\ndestabilisation for China, and more campaigns are expected to continue to target Australia.\nLab52 highlights how tracking and monitoring events in international relations allows us to\nunderstand the motivations of key actor-states.\n\nIOC\n\n123.253.35[.]231\n\n4fbfbf1cd2efaef1906f0bd2195281b77619b9948e829b4d53bf1f198ba81dc5\n\ne2acbc36c2cce4050e34033c12f766fea58b4196d84cf40e979fac8fed24c942\n\n3c4671b4a0c3e7da186bd356e07cf0daca7267addde668044b1ded42c6dbe09b\n\n5dde3bca0e5319c62d547bd0c37e621f2050598a347447bde832a9fc37efd97d\n\n167a842b97d0434f20e0cd6cf73d07079255a743d26606b94fc785a0f3c6736e\n\n41276827827b95c9b5a9fbd198b7cff2aef6f90f2b2b3ea84fadb69c55efa171\n\nf8e6b2e537325d6775d35755c8fe19ef89b27e1a7aba183490fbcbf2d52c15f4\n\nReferences\n\n\n-----\n\n[1] – https://blog.talosintelligence.com/mustang-panda-targets-europe/\n\n[2] – https://gblogs.cisco.com/jp/2022/05/talos-mustang-panda-targets-europe/\n\n\n-----",
