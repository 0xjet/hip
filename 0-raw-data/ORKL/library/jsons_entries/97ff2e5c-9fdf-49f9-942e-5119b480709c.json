The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic offered a catalyst\nfor this tactic with its accompanying weakened organizational security and increased levels\nof fear and anxiety among workers—key conditions for successful extortion attempts. As a\nresult we are seeing more companies being targeted with various new extortion techniques\nand ransomware gangs are accumulating large profits.\n\n**How have ransomware extortion tactics evolved?**\n\nIn the second half of 2020, Accenture Cyber Threat Intelligence has observed ransomware\ngroups attempting to ratchet up pressure on victims to pay ransoms by increasing service\ndisruptions, and reputational damage. At the same time, some groups are also attempting\n\n\n-----\n\nto build trust with their victims, by setting out a framework of principles they adhere to, or\nproviding a set of “guarantees”, to increase the chances ransoms will be paid.\n\nTrend 1: Expanded service disruption\n\nThe principal impact of a ransomware attack has always been service disruption. When its\nnetwork or a portion is ‘held hostage,’ an organisation faces pressure to acquiesce to\nransom demands in the hope of restoring operations. The good news is that many\norganisations are now more effective at defending against and recovering from the\nransomware itself. Unfortunately, threat actors are also upping their game.\n\n**Tactic: DDOS attacks**\n\nA concerning new tactic is the addition of distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks to\nransomware and data theft attempts. On their ‘name and shame’ website, the ransomware\ngroup SunCrypt specifies whether it launched a DDOS attack against a victim, as shown in\nthe image below.\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n<<< End >>>\n\nSunCrypt often deploys a DDOS attack when ransom payment negotiations stall. For\norganizations already suffering a service disruption due to the ransomware, a DDOS attack\nmay exacerbate the disruption and complicate mitigation. This is particularly troublesome\n\n\n-----\n\nfor organisations in industries where any extended downtime can be very damaging, such\nas healthcare, logistics, and financial services.\n\nThe [Accenture Cyber Threat Intelligence (ACTI) team expects other ransomware gangs will](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/security/cyber-defense?src=curated+daily+content_twitter_100001148493693)\nadopt this tactic in the near future.\n\n**How to protect against DDOS attacks**\n\nACTI suggests organizations:\n\nEstablish strong working relationships with their internet service providers while also\npreparing a coordinated approach to DDOS attacks.\nDeploy appropriate technology to recognize the signs of a DDOS attack early.\nPrepare and test Incident Response playbooks and DDOS mitigation plans.\n\nTrend 2: Increased reputation damage\n\nRansomware gangs are becoming increasingly effective at exposing successful attacks to\nthe public to elicit payment. To pressure victims to pay, particularly those that succeed in\nminimizing the service disruption, groups usually first threaten to damage the reputation of\nthe victim and, if that does not succeed, start releasing sensitive information. Publicly\nexposing information may lead a victim’s customer base to believe the victim is lying about\nthe compromise, has poor network security, or could still be compromised—all of which can\nlead to long-term reputational damage for the victim.\n\n**Tactic: Retaliating against companies that deny or withhold information about a**\n**breach**\n\nThis past October, REvil (a.k.a. Sodinokibi) ransomware operators noticed that one of its\ntargets had notified its clients that it was unable to verify claims of data theft. In retaliation,\nREvil published screenshots of negotiations with the company to refute that statement:\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n\n-----\n\n<<< End >>>\n\n**Nefilim ransomware operators use their blog “Corporate Leaks” to release victims' data in**\nincrements. In September, the media reported on a victim of a yet-unattributed cyber attack,\nwhich included a quote from a security professional associated with the victim. The quote\nsuggested there was no evidence of access or theft of data. In response, in an October blog\npost, Nefilim pasted the quote and uploaded several files purportedly belonging to the\nvictim, along with the statement:\n\n\"It seems that the security advisors do not know how to do their job or they were asked by\n\n[COMPANY NAME REDACTED] to lie for them. [COMPANY NAME REDACTED] knew that\nthe breach has happened and received proof of the breach.\n\nThis confirms ransomware gangs follow news coverage on their victims and will discredit\nthem by publishing and responding to victim statements.\n\nIn September, a SunCrypt ransomware victim issued a brief statement on its company's\nwebsite (since removed) titled “[COMPANY NAME REDACTED] repels cyber attack.” The\nstatement said the “incident is under further investigation, but at present there are no\nindications that information has been stolen.” SunCrypt operators copied the statement to\ntheir victim blog and uploaded screenshots and a file of data allegedly stolen from the\nvictim.\n\n**Tactic: Use of mainstream platforms to increase pressure**\n\n[An actor associated with REvil carried out an-in depth interview with a Russian security](https://threatpost.com/revil-video-game-hit-revenue/160743/)\nresearcher in October. Uploaded to YouTube, the video showed the actor alluding to an\nattack on a major game developer, to pressure it into paying.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn November, Ragnar Locker ransomware operators used a hacked Facebook account to\nrelease an advertisement that stated one of their victims had falsely claimed no data had\nbeen stolen. They then issued a deadline for the victim to pay. Although the advertisement\n[was not seen by a wide audience before it was blocked by Facebook, the media picked up](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/11/ransomware-group-turns-to-facebook-ads/)\non it and spread the message further.\n\n**Tactic: Press releases**\n\n**Maze was the frontrunner of the ‘press release’ strategy to call out uncompliant targets.**\nThey have since retired, but their apparent successor – Egregor – gives out a “Hole of the\nMonth Award” to reveal the organization with the biggest “gap in security practices.” In\nOctober, two companies received the award, which included details on how the companies\nleft sensitive information unprotected – passwords, source code, unencrypted chats, and\ncontracts. They concluded the press release with a statement indicating the group\nmaintains access to the targeted company’s network: “P.S. Everyone who is going to use\n_the products of that companies soon, try to think about the possible backdoors from_\n_Egregor Team.”_\n\n**Darkside and SunCrypt ransomware also have a dedicated Press Release section on their**\nwebsite.\n\n**Mitigation**\n\nTo protect against reputational damage, ACTI suggests organizations:\n\nImplement a clear media strategy to convey information about a cyber security\nincident.\nExercise caution when releasing statements denying the extent of any attack until the\nfull details are known as attackers will expose any miscommunications or falsehoods.\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n[2020 Cyber Threatscape Report](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/security/cyber-threatscape-report)\n\n[READ THE REPORT](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/security/cyber-threatscape-report)\n\n<<< End >>>\n\nTrend 3: Increased attack costs\n\n\n-----\n\nData theft and exposure is now firmly front and center in the arsenal of most ransomware\ngangs’ extortion tactics, which can increase the cost of the attack. Attackers are extorting\nhigher ransoms and eliciting prompt victim payment by taking advantage of data breach\nregulations such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or\nUS state legislation requiring those suffering a data breach to notify relevant stakeholders.\nData breach victims can face stiff fines for violating such rules. Added to this is the personal\ncost to the individuals exposed in the breach: Threat actors often seek out insurance\npolicies, credit card data, passports, personal emails and more, to expose them on their\nwebsite.\n\n**Tactic: Exposing increasingly personal and sensitive information**\n\nIn October, the REvil blog posted a page that contained the last will and testament of the\ncompany owner of one of its victims, and threatened to publish passport information on the\nowner’s family. In addition they posted the company’s entire insurance policy which\nincluded a “Cyber Extortion Loss” coverage limit of $5 million. This imitates a LockBit\nransomware affiliate that emailed a victim’s stolen cyber insurance policy to security\nresearchers for reporting purposes and to extort the victim.\n\nIn the same month, for a REvil victim in the office equipment industry, the actors searched\nthe stolen data for the word “bank” and published a screenshot of its findings. The group\nwas likely looking for bank account numbers or other lucrative financial information.\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n\n-----\n\n<<< End >>>\n\n**Mitigation**\n\nTo protect against theft and exposure of data, ACTI suggests organizations:\n\nIncorporate strict handling policies for personal identifiable information (PII) and\nensure minimal personal sensitive data is stored on corporate networks.\nTake steps to secure networks against data theft: keeping software up to date,\ncarrying out regular risk assessments, encrypting and backing up data and training\nstaff on best practices.\n\nTrend 4: Facilitating ransom payment to resolve a breach\n\nIn stark contrast to the above trends, some gangs are attempting to set themselves apart as\ntrustworthy, charitable and easy to do business with, in order to encourage ransom payment\ncooperation. These gangs will streamline the payment and decryption process and publicly\nstate their ‘ethical’ business model, which supposedly translates to less chance of media\ncoverage, less downtime and no data exposure.\n\n**Tactic: The ‘nice guy’ approach**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ragnar Locker ransomware operators provide clear instructions on how to pay and use**\ntheir decryptor, and provide the ‘Ragnar_Locker Team Guarantee’:\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n<<< End >>>\n\nThe guarantee touches upon malicious extortion techniques employed by other gangs:\nposting conversations (REvil), leaving backdoors (Egregor) and launching DDoS attacks\n(SunCrypt). They also claim to identify and address other vulnerabilities to reduce their\nvictim's chance of suffering a future ransomware attack.\n\n[The Darkside ransomware operators donated funds to two legitimate non-profit charities in](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-gang-donates-part-of-ransom-demands-to-charity-organizations/)\nOctober to demonstrate ‘altruistic’ behavior. Additionally, on their website, they include\n‘assurances’ that they have pre-determined the ransom amount a victim can afford to pay\nand that they promise not to attack hospitals, schools, non-profits or governments:\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n<<< End >>>\n\n\n-----\n\n**Mitigation**\n\nACTI acknowledges that the ransom payment debate is complicated. Victims must weigh\nthe pros and cons of ransom payment with the pressure to quickly resolve the network\ndisruption. Despite attempting to appear principled, threat actors are not always true to their\nword. Ransomware gangs have said they will not attack hospitals, but have then attacked a\nhospital. They have promised to delete stolen data that subsequently appeared on dark\nweb forums.\n\nACTI suggests following the guidance contained within Accenture Security’s 30 November\nblog [Securing your business and the world from ransomware. This highlights the need to](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/security/securing-business-and-world-from-ransomware)\n[follow advice contained within the US government advisory related to ransom payments.](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory_10012020_1.pdf)\nACTI also stresses the importance of having a clear post-breach strategy in place to lessen\nthe impact of these extortion techniques if an attack occurs. This includes comprehensive\nincident response playbooks, business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and\nimplementing a clear media strategy.\nOur [ACTI team provides actionable and relevant threat intelligence to support decision](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/security/cyber-defense?src=curated+daily+content_twitter_100001148493693)\nmakers.
