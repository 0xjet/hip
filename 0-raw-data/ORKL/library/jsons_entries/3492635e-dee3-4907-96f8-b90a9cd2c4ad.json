    "plain_text": "# More on Huaying Haitai and Laoying Baichaun, the companies associated with APT10. Is there a state connection?\n\n**[intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2018/08/09/was-apt10-the-work-of-individuals-a-company-or-the-state/](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2018/08/09/was-apt10-the-work-of-individuals-a-company-or-the-state/)**\n\nintrusiontruth August 9, 2018\n\nIn the absence of more concrete proof, the 2017 Cloud Hopper report on APT10 relied on\ntiming analysis to make the connection to China. Compile times of executable files and\nregistration times of domains all pointed to work undertaken between 9am and 5pm Beijing\ntime.\n\nIf Zheng Yanbin, Gao Qiang and Zhang Shilong were working between 9am and 5pm and\nmanaged to orchestrate one of the largest Cyber attacks on western infrastructure of all time,\nit follows that any company for whom they were working would probably have been involved\nin the operation.\n\n**Laoying Baichaun Instruments Equipment Co Ltd**\n\nThe first company identified in our article on Gao Qiang was Laoying Baichaun Instruments\nEquipment Co Ltd. It was associated with fisherxp via his name, phone number and the\npostcode registered to fisherx[.]com, and less conclusively to Zhang Shilong via the photo he\ntook from a building nearby on Xinkai Road. The company has offices in Tianjin and appears\nto still operate, making sales online.\n\n\n-----\n\nXinkai Road, the home of Laoying Baichaun Instruments Equipment Co Ltd\n**Tianjin Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Co Ltd**\n\nThe second company identified was the Tianjin Huaying Haitai Science and Technology\nDevelopment Co Ltd (天津华盈海泰科技发展有限公司). It was associated with fisherxp via a\njob advert placed in his name. Huaying Haitai has an entry in several online Chinese\ncompany registration databases.\n\nAlibaba Enterprise entry for Huaying Haitai\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fang Ting, Sun Jie and Feng Tao**\n\n[The entries name two shareholders – Fang Ting (方亭), who owns 70% of the company, and](https://www.1688.com/xinyong/71d4fbe762e6e6987d7f9932ba806ada.html)\nSun Jie (孙杰) who owns 30%.\n\nShareholder information for Tianjin Huaying Haitai from 1688.com\nAnother individual named Feng Tao is also associated with the company, listed as a\nmanager in some databases.\n\nThe company is headquartered in Tianjin at the Fuyu Plaza building on Jiefang South Road\nin the Hexi district (天津市河西区解放南路中段西侧富裕大厦1-1906).\n\nCompany information online shows that the company has previously had a website –\nhuayinghaitai[.]com – though there is no trace of it ever having had any content\n\nThe site shown above includes a company profile that loosely translates as:\n\n\n-----\n\nHaitai Technology Development Co., Ltd. is a high-tech company dedicated to network\nsecurity construction and network security product development. The company’s\ntechnical team is a senior engineer with extensive network security experience\noverseas. Enthusiasm and superb technology contribute to China’s cyber security and\ncontribute to the world’s cyber security. We also welcome enthusiastic young people to\njoin my team and career.\n\nWHOIS registration information for the huayinghaitai[.]com domain shows that the domain is\nregistered to zhangduker[at]gmail.com with the phone number +86 022 88269292. Other\ndomains associated with the same e-mail address bear the name Zhang Du, including:\n\n8haowaimai.cn\n8haowaimai.com.cn\nappforge.cn\nappforge.com.cn\nbahaowaimai.cn\nbahaowaimai.com.cn\nbahaozhizunwaimai.cn\nbahaozhizunwaimai.com.cn\ndaodewang.cn\ndns-up.org\ngujian.net.cn\nhuayinghaitai.com\niecho.cn\niecho.com.cn\nlinuxhome.com.cn\nlinuxhome.org.cn\nlvxinghome.com\nzhizunwaimai.cn\nzhizunwaimai.com.cn\n\n**Association with the state?**\n\nHaving identified two companies at one time connected to at least one APT10 hacker, the\nquestion remains – were they hacking on behalf of the Chinese state? Huaying Haitai is a\nsmall company with two shareholders and, for a Cyber security company, a very small web\npresence. The situation bears more than a striking resemblance to Boyusec, a company\nused as cover for APT3 activity by the Chinese Ministry of State Security.\n\nThis blog believes that it has proof of links between the APT10 actors named in our research\nand the Chinese state, but our analysts are keen to corroborate it before publishing. If you\n**are a Cyber Threat Intelligence analyst and have information that could help us**\n**confirm the link between Zheng Yanbin, Gao Qiang, Zhang Shilong, Laoying Baichaun**\n**or Huaying Haitai and the Chinese state, please** **[contact us.](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/contact/)**\n\n\n-----",
