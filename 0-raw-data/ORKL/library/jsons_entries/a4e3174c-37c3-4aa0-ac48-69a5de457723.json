The agreement includes cybersecurity cooperation, technology transfer,](https://www.c4isrnet.com/thought-leadership/2021/02/08/russia-iran-cooperation-poses-challenges-for-us-cyber-strategy-global-norms/)\ncombined training, and coordination at multilateral forums, like the United Nations.\n\nMore on:\n\n[Cybersecurity](https://www.cfr.org/defense-and-security/cybersecurity)\n\n[Iran](https://www.cfr.org/middle-east-and-north-africa/iran)\n\n[Russia](https://www.cfr.org/europe-and-eurasia/russia)\n\n[Security Alliances](https://www.cfr.org/defense-and-security/security-alliances)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Although the cooperation with Moscow outlined in the agreement could upgrade Tehran s](https://www.ynetnews.com/business/article/rk005B5FeO)\noffensive cyber capabilities, the agreement is largely defensive, motivated by the countries’\nshared [animus toward the United States and U.S. influence in the Middle East as well as a](https://carnegie.ru/2016/08/18/russia-and-iran-historic-mistrust-and-contemporary-partnership-pub-64365)\ndesire to reduce dependence on Western technology. There are limits, however, to how\nclosely the two sides can be expected to work together. The relationship between Russia\nand Iran has long suffered from mutual suspicion, ideological differences, and competition.\nMoreover, in the past, Russian and Iranian operators have operated at cross purposes. For\n[example, in October 2019, British and U.S. officials revealed that the Russian threat actor](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cyber-idUSKBN1X00AK)\n[Turla had](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/turla) [hijacked Iranian hacking infrastructure as part of a false-flag operation.](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/hijacking-iranian-hacking-infrastructure)\n\nNet Politics\n\n**CFR experts investigate the impact of information and communication technologies**\n**on security, privacy, and international affairs. 2-4 times weekly.**\n\n[View all newsletters >](https://link.cfr.org/join/66n/signup&hash=2d4c5929e9e04cc42f5cd375fb8dcfb1)\n\n## Digital and Cyberspace Update\n\n**Digital and Cyberspace Policy program updates on cybersecurity, digital trade,**\n**internet governance, and online privacy.

Nonetheless, the agreement could pose four challenges to\nU.S. cyber operations. First, Russia could help Iran obtain stronger cyber defense systems.\nHarvard’s Belfer Center’s [National Cyber Power Index 2020 [PDF] lists Iran as the lowest-](https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/2020-09/NCPI_2020.pdf)\nscoring nation for cyber defense capabilities, with Russia ranked in the middle of the\n\n\n-----\n\ncountries surveyed. If Tehran addresses these defensive deficiencies with the help of\n[Russian technology and training, it could make U.S. initiatives like defend forward [PDF]](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Sep/18/2002041658/-1/-1/1/CYBER_STRATEGY_SUMMARY_FINAL.PDF)\nmore challenging and costly.\n\nSecond, Iran-Russia cyber cooperation could entail Russian cyber teams deploying to Iran to\nmonitor Iranian networks in order to collect insights and identify U.S. malware, similar to U.S.\n[Cyber Command’s “Hunt Forward” operations. Acquiring and analyzing Cyber Command or](https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/2433245/hunt-forward-estonia-estonia-us-strengthen-partnership-in-cyber-domain-with-joi/)\nNational Security Agency hacking tools and techniques could help improve Russian and\nIranian defenses, thwart future U.S. cyber operations, and force U.S. hackers to develop new\nexploits sooner than they hoped.\n\nThird, if able to access Iranian defense systems, Russian hackers could acquire and reverse\nengineer U.S. or Israeli malware that has been used against Iran. This occurred with the\nStuxnet worm, which targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities in 2010 and was attributed to the\n[United States and Israel. Since then, numerous cyber actors have developed over 22 million](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/stuxnet-returns-striking-iran-with/)\npieces of malware that used Stuxnet’s blueprint to target organizations around the world.\nStuxnet eventually infected thousands of networks globally, so hackers had access to lots of\nsamples, but an attack that did not become as widely known could still be repurposed if\nRussia is able to access Iranian networks.\n\nFourth, technologies and techniques that Iran acquires from Russia could be provided to\nIran’s proxies around the Middle East, including Hezbollah and militias in Iraq and Yemen.\nSome of these groups have already shown considerable hacking capabilities. In January,\nsecurity firm ClearSky [revealed that a Hezbollah-affiliated hacking group named Lebanese](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hezbollahs-cyber-unit-hacked-into-telecoms-and-isps/)\nCedar was involved in an extensive campaign that targeted telecoms and internet service\nproviders in the United States, Europe, and Middle East. Equipping Iranian proxies with\nadvanced Russian cyber capabilities could allow them to threaten government agencies,\nbusinesses, and U.S. operations in the Middle East. It could also hamper investigations into\ncyber operations conducted by Iranian proxies and lead to misattributing them to Russia,\npossibly causing unintended escalation.\n\nMore on:\n\n[Cybersecurity](https://www.cfr.org/defense-and-security/cybersecurity)\n\n[Iran](https://www.cfr.org/middle-east-and-north-africa/iran)\n\n[Russia](https://www.cfr.org/europe-and-eurasia/russia)\n\n[Security Alliances](https://www.cfr.org/defense-and-security/security-alliances)\n\nAlthough the agreement between Moscow and Tehran could pose challenges for U.S. cyber\nstrategy, some of its disruptive implications can be mitigated. To minimize the risk of their\nhacking tools being repurposed for use against them, the United States and its allies should\nestablish a unified vulnerability disclosure mechanism to share vulnerabilities, including\n\n\n-----\n\nthose that have already been exploited, with each other and vendors. While the United\n[States already has a vulnerability equities process, other allies seem to have only varying](https://www.wired.com/story/vulnerability-equity-process-charter-transparency-concerns/)\ndegrees of similar processes, if at all. Because victims are likely to patch vulnerabilities once\nthey’ve been targeted, the attacking country can disclose the vulnerabilities it used after\nthey’ve been exploited without weakening its offensive capabilities. Furthermore, the United\nStates could promote the responsible development of offensive capabilities by adding selfdestruct code modules to prevent them from being analyzed by adversaries. These modules\n[have been deployed as part of highly sophisticated malware campaigns in the past and are](https://www.neowin.net/news/a-new-virus-will-self-destruct-when-analyzed-by-researchers/)\ndesigned to overwrite their own file data in order to prevent forensic analysis.\n\nDigital and Cyberspace Update\n\n**Digital and Cyberspace Policy program updates on cybersecurity, digital trade,**\n**internet governance, and online privacy.

As cyber cooperation\nbetween Russia and Iran grows, leaving it unchallenged could pose new threats to U.S.\nsecurity and strategy in the Middle East.\n\n\n-----",
