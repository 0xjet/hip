Kaspersky refines the\nattribution to the Andariel APT, a subgroup of Lazarus. Korea CERT (KrCERT) reports a new attack\nand calls the malware tools seen in this attack TigerDownloader and TigerRAT. The KrCERT report\nprovides a thorough and detailed, indicator-based analysis of the relationship between their\nmalware samples and those previously analyzed by Kaspersky and Malwarebytes. They also employ\na proprietary attribution technology to further relate the attacks.\n\nIn this report, we focus on the malware tooling from the previously reported attacks. We provide new\nevidence to attribute these tools to the same downloader and RAT families. We will refer to these\nfamilies as TigerDownloader and TigerRAT respectively. We've chosen these names in recognition\nof KrCERT's important work where the names were first introduced to refer to the malware tools they\nstudied in that same work.\n\nWe systematically study code reuse as well as functional commonalities between all the samples\nused in different stages of the previously reported attacks (i.e., packers, downloaders, and RAT\npayloads). We have also found that while the tools fall into the mentioned families, there are different\nvariants of the tools which have been deployed in the reported attacks. For the RAT payloads, we\nhave found three versions with distinct capabilities. For the downloaders we have found two\nversions, one with and the other without persistence capabilities.\n\nApart from these findings, we contribute novel insights and speculations to the existing body of\nknowledge toward a clearer mapping of the techniques and tools used by this threat actor. Finally,\nwe are making our unpacking and config extraction scripts as well as raw data available to the\ncommunity (https://github.com/threatray/tigerrat) to facilitate further research and defense\ncapabilities.\n\n\ncapabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### PREVIOUS RESEARCH\n\n**April 19, 2021: Malwarebytes has reported a recent attack targeting South Korea using a malicious**\nWord document. The Malwarebytes report describes the attack and attributes it to the Lazarus\ngroup. Malwarebytes discovered a novel downloader component used in the attack. https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-intelligence/2021/04/lazarus-apt-conceals-malicious-codewithin-bmp-file-to-drop-its-rat/\n\n**June 15, 2021: Kaspersky released a blog post about the same attack, mentioning the**\nMalwarebytes report, saying they detected the Word document in April. Kaspersky refines the\nattribution to the Andariel APT group, a subgroup of Lazarus. Kaspersky’s analysis is based on\noperational similarities found between the current and past attacks of the Andariel APT group. They\nalso identify novel downloaders and RAT payloads. In addition, they find a new ransomware\ndeployed by the RAT. – https://securelist.com/andariel-evolves-to-target-south-korea-withransomware/102811/\n\n**September, 2021: KrCERT reports on an operation they call \"ByteTiger\", a campaign targeting**\nSouth Korean entities which they have attributed to the Andariel APT group. This report analyses in\ndetail a multistage attack with two unknown pieces of code which they call TigerDownloader and\nTigerRAT. They link the new attack to the samples previously disclosed by Malwarebytes and\nKaspersky using some proprietary tooling. Linkage is apparently done through similarities / re-use\nof code, rich headers, section hashes and C2 infrastructure, yet no further details are shared in the\nreport.\nhttps://www.krcert.or.kr/filedownload.do?attach_file_seq=3277&attach_file_id=EpF3277.pdf\n\n\n### INTRODUCTION\n\n##### WHAT IS THE ANDARIEL APT GROUP?\n\nAndariel group is a state-sponsored threat actor. It is a subgroup of the Lazarus cybercrime group,\nconsidered one of the most sophisticated North Korean threat actors to which threat researchers\nhave attributed many attacks from 2009 to 2021. The Andariel group is mostly targeting South\nKorean entities focusing mainly on financial gain and cyber espionage. This group is known to\nemploy custom tools and new techniques to increase the effectiveness of its attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Similarities and differences between the attack chains reported by Malwarebytes,_\n\n_Kaspersky and KrCERT._\n\n\nThe attack chains in all the reported cases have some structural similarities (see Figure 1). In all three\nreports a downloader malware has been observed. Kaspersky and KrCERT have additionally seen a\nthird-stage RAT components. Concerning the access methods, malicious documents have been\nused in the cases reported by Malwarebytes and Kaspersky, whereas a compromised website was\nused in the KrCERT case.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo quickly understand if the packed samples are related, we performed an automated code reuse\nanalysis at the function level. The results forming that analysis are shown in Figure 2. In the table, the\nnumbers in the “function reuse” column measure the number of samples in which a function occurs.\nAs an example, the function at the address 0x140002b70 (first row) appears in 27 out of 27 the\npacked samples. That is, this is a function that occurs in all packed samples.\n\n_Figure 2: Function reuse across the 27 packed binaries which we have analyzed._\n\n\n### PACKER ANALYSIS\n\nIn this section we will first establish that the packed binaries share common code that originates from\nthe unpacking algorithm. Then we show that there is a common packing scheme underlying all the\npacked samples at our disposal. Our findings thus provide strong evidence that the binaries are\nrelated by the same packer. Should the packer be under exclusive control of the attacker (which we\ndon’t know) then our findings would allow attribution of all the binaries to the same actor.\n\n##### SHARED CODE IN PACKED SAMPLES\n\nTo quickly understand if the packed samples are related, we performed an automated code reuse\nanalysis at the function level. The results forming that analysis are shown in Figure 2. In the table, the\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the analysis, we suspected that the samples share a few functions for the effective\nunpacking, while some of the remaining functions are used to avoid detections by antivirus, Yara and\nrelated pattern-based detection technologies. We then took a closer look at these stable functions\nand could confirm that they do, indeed, contain packing functionality. The results of this analysis are\nshown in Figure 3.\n\n**Packed hash** **Function address** **Function reuse** **Functionality**\n\n0996a8e5ec1a41645309... 140002b70 (27/27) map_decrypted_payload()\n\n0996a8e5ec1a41645309... 140001bf0 (27/27) anti_analysis_check()\n\n0996a8e5ec1a41645309... 140002030 (26/27) do_unpacking()\n\n0996a8e5ec1a41645309... 140002860 (26/27) dynamic_winapi_resolution()\n\n0996a8e5ec1a41645309... 140002360 (12/27) main_program()\n\n0996a8e5ec1a41645309... 140002a30 (14/27) relocate_mapped_payload()\n\n_Figure 3: Functionality found in the most stable functions._\n\nWe could also confirm the presence of junk code to avoid detection technologies. Figure 4 shows\nthe same function decrypt_payload() in two different samples. We can see junk functions like\nGetFontUnicodeRanges(), GetSysColorBrush() and CreateBitMap() which are called but whose\nreturn values are not being used. In the figure, the effective unpacking code, which in this case is the\nXOR decryption algorithm, is contained within the green boxes shown.\n\nWe have found this junk-code strategy in all the packed code and throughout many functions.\n\n\nThere are several other functions (i.e., 0x140001bf0, 0x140002030, 0x140002860) that appear in 27\nor 26 samples. From the table, we can establish that the packed samples are clearly related. All of\nthem have two functions in common and there are various subsets of the samples that feature\nsubstantial code reuse.\n\nIn a nutshell, the automated function reuse analysis gives us a quick understanding about the\nrelations of the packed samples. As we shall see next, it also directs our manual analysis efforts.\n\nBased on the analysis, we suspected that the samples share a few functions for the effective\nunpacking, while some of the remaining functions are used to avoid detections by antivirus, Yara and\nrelated pattern-based detection technologies. We then took a closer look at these stable functions\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Junk code in packer code to avoid anti-virus and Yara detections._\n\nIn summary, we have seen so far that the packed samples are related by a common packer code.\nThe code-wise differences between the packed samples is mainly due to the presence of junk code.\n\n##### COMMON PACKING SCHEME\n\nThe packer is a simple loader, which decrypts and maps the payload into memory. The decryption\nscheme is a simple XOR using a 16-byte key. This has been established in previous research.\n\nAdditionally, we found that all packer variants follow the same common packing scheme, whereas\nthe variants of the scheme are determined by two parameters. One parameter is whether or not the\npacked payload is Base64 encoded, the other is where the packed payload is stored within a PE file.\n\nThe variations concerning encoding of the payload are illustrated in Figure 5.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Above, Base64 encoding of encrypted payload; below, encrypted payload without encoding._\n\nConcerning the location of the packed code, we have observed that there are three locations within\na PE file where the packed payload is stored. The locations are depicted in Figure 6.\n\n_Figure 6: Variations of packed code locations in a PE file. Left to right, packed code in PE overlay, in the PE_\n\n_resource section, or in a dedicated PE section which is named OTC in this example._\n\n\n-----\n\nFor the third variant using a dedicated section, we observed the following section names: “KDATA,”\n\"OTC,” “OTS,” “OTT,” and “data.” We could not identify the significance, if any, underlying these\nnames.\n\nOur findings are summarized in Figure 7, which shows the packing scheme common to all packed\ndownloader and RAT variants we analyzed.\n\n\n_Figure 7: Packing scheme common to all samples._\n\n\n-----\n\n### MALWARE FAMILIES AND VARIANTS\n\nIn this section, we will establish through code reuse analysis that all the unpacked binaries fall into a\ndownloader or RAT family. We are calling these families the TigerDownloader and TigerRAT\nmalware family. These names were introduced in the KrCERT report to refer to the downloader and\nRAT components in their investigation.\n\nTo get a quick understanding of the unpacked binaries, we have performed a combined cluster and\ncode-reuse analysis. This analysis allows us to automatically identify malware families and malware\nvariants within a family. The goal of this analysis is to gain a quick understanding of the relationship\nbetween binaries and to direct analysts to the relevant samples for further manual analysis to\neventually understand the attacker’s tooling and capabilities.\n\n\nThe results of the cluster and code-reuse analysis are shown in Figure 8. The figure confirms that the\nunpacked binaries either fall into the TigerDownloader (blue) or TigerRAT (orange) family. Moreover,\nwe see that each family has three variants (shown as large circles). We have used a cluster threshold\nof 97.5%, meaning that binaries which are at least 97.5% similar fall into the same cluster. The clusters\nin the graph consist of the so-called “cluster representatives” (large circles) and samples (small\ncircles) directly connected to a cluster representative. The underlying idea is that the samples within\na cluster are essentially identical and thus well represented by the cluster representative.\n\n_Figure 8: Cluster and code-reuse analysis of the unpacked samples with their abbreviated hashes._\n\nWe note that the choice of the cluster threshold has an obvious impact on the variants: A high\nthreshold will reveal minor and more variants, while a low one reveals fewer and only major variants.\n\nWe draw the following conclusions from the graphs:\n\n  - There is no code reuse between the TigerDownloader and the TigerRAT family. We recall\nfrom the packer analysis that although the families are code-wise distinct, they are packed\nusing the same packing scheme.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe table in Figure 9 shows the detailed composition of the clusters from the previous graphs. We\nalso notice that some (hash-wise) unique packed samples result in (hash-wise) identical unpacked\nsample, reducing the effective diversity of the samples under consideration.\n\n_Figure 9: Detailed cluster information._\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the following sections we will analyze the downloader and RAT variants in more detail, limiting\nour analysis to the cluster representatives. This ability to reduce analysis to cluster representatives\nis key for the directed and efficient analysis and tracking of malware variants. The choice of cluster\nrepresentatives and their names used in the following analysis are shown in Figure 10.\n\n**Cluster** **Stage** **Sample Name** **Hash**\n\n0 RAT (x64) RAT-Kaspersky- bbddcb280af742ce10842b18b9d71206\n3[rd] stage x64 32cc042a8fe42eed90fc4bc94f2d71ac\n\n1 RAT (x64) RAT-KrCERT-x64 32f6b229913d68daad937cc72a57aa452\n3[rd] stage 91a9d623109ed48938815aa7b6005c\n\n\n2 Downloader (x64)\n2[nd] stage\n\n3 Downloader (x64)\n2[nd] stage\n\n4 Downloader (x86)\n2[nd] stage\n\n5 RAT (x86)\n3[rd] stage\n\n\nDownloaderMalwarebytes-x64\n\n\nRAT-Kasperskyx86\n\n\n1177105e51fa02f9977bd435f9066123ac\ne32b991ed54912ece8f3d4fbeeade4\n\n\nDownloaderKaspersky-x64\n\n\n588cdbd3ee3594525eb62fa7bab148f6d\n7ab000737fc0c311a5588dc96794acc\n\n\nDownloaderKaspersky-x86\n\n\n49a13bf0aa53990771b7b7a7ab31d6805\ned1b547e7d9f114e8e26a98f6fbee28\n\n\n464eaa82103f6f479e0d62dd48d2dab8e\nce300458136c03165d20915ee658067\n\n\n_Figure 10: Cluster representatives used in the subsequent analysis._\n\n\n-----\n\n### TIGERDOWNLOADER VARIANTS\n\nIn this section, we take a closer look at the two downloader variants: Downloader-Malwarebytes-x64\nand Downloader-Kaspersky-x64. From the cluster and code reuse analysis (see Figure 8) we know\nthat they share 97% of code and thus are minor variants of the TigerDownloader family.\n\nUsing the binary diffing capabilities of our analysis toolchain, we see in Figure 11 that the samples\nare largely made up of the same functions, except for one unique function (the one with the address\n0x140001230) in the Kaspersky (Downloader-Kaspersky-x64) sample.\n\n\n_Figure 11: Function level diff between Downloader-Kaspersky-x64 and Downloader-Malwarebytes-x64._\n\nAnalyzing the downloader sample from Kaspersky (see Figure 12), we see that the unknown function\n(0x140001230) is called from the main function of the downloader.\n\n_Figure 12: Left, Downloader-Kaspersky-x64; right, Downloader-Malwarebytes-x64._\n\n\n-----\n\nIt turns out that this function is used to achieve persistence. The technique being used is\nstraightforward and consists of creating a link in the current user startup folder to make sure that the\ndownloader is started upon reboot of a victim machine (see Figures 13 and 14).\n\n\n_Figure 13: Function which creates a shortcut for persistence._\n\n_Figure 14: Shortcut to persistent executable._\n\nFinally, we note that we haven’t found any persistence techniques in the Downloader-Malwarebytesx64 sample. The reason is likely to minimize indicators being left on victim machines.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS TO THE KRCERT TIGERDOWNLOADER\n\nUnfortunately, the downloader sample (f0ff67d4d34fe34d52a44b3515c44950) from the KrCERT\nreport is not available publicly, thus we could not include it into our analysis. To nevertheless\nexamine possible relations between KrCERT and the Malwarebytes and Kaspersky downloaders, we\nattempted to connect them purely based on the artifacts and behaviors publicly reported by KrCERT.\n\nLet’s start with a negative result. KrCERT reports a couple of C2 commands which they have found\nin their downloader (see Figure 15). We couldn’t find any of the “Tiger10X” identifiers in the\ndownloaders at our disposal. Neither were we able to find any other identifiers which could be\npossible C2 commands.\n\n\n**Identifier** **Action**\n\nTiger101 Send victim info\n\nTiger102 Receive command\n\nTiger103 File upload\n\n_Figure 15: TigerDownloader C2 commands reported by KrCERT._\n\nOn the other hand, we have found various aspects reported by KrCERT that are also present in the\nother downloaders:\n\n###### • The packer in the KrCERT reports fits into the packer scheme which we have established\nabove.\n\n  - KrCERT reports that the communication is encoded using Base64, which we have also\nobserved in our samples.\n\n  - The 3rd stages (RATs) which are downloaded by the 2nd stages (downloaders) all belong to\nthe same TigerRAT family (as we shall establish in the following section).\n\nIn a nutshell, the observations above suggest that the KrCERT Downloader might be related to the\ndownloaders observed by Malwarebytes and Kaspersky. However, this is speculative because we\nlack hard evidence since we don’t have access to the KrCERT sample.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor this analysis, we’ll focus on the representatives RAT-Kaspersky-x64, RAT-KrCERT-x64 and RATKaspersky-x86 which we established earlier (see Figure 10).\n\n##### COMMANDS AND CAPABILITIES PER VARIANT\n\nLet’s look at the C2 commands which we have found in the different variants. Figure 16 shows all the\nC2 commands that we have observed in at least one of the three RAT variants. The absence of the\ncommands with the ids 0x08 and 0x09 lead us to speculate that there are yet unknown samples in\nthe wild which do include these commands.\n\n**Command** **ID**\n\nSelfDelete 0x01\n\nSystemInfo 0x02\n\nShell 0x03\n\nFileManager 0x04\n\nKeylogger 0x05\n\nSocksTunnel 0x06\n\nScreenCapture 0x07\n\nPortForwarder 0x0a\n\n_Figure 16: Summary of all C2 commands which are available in at least one of the three RAT variants._\n\n\n### TIGERRAT VARIANTS\n\nWe recall from the code reuse and cluster analysis (see Figure 8) that we could connect all RATs to\nthe same TigerRAT family through code-reuse analysis. We have also seen that there are RAT variants\nthat differ more substantially than the downloader variants. For instance, the variants RAT-Kaspersky-\nx64 and RAT-KrCERT-x64 share only about 50% of their code.\n\nIn this section, we take a closer look at the RAT variants. We present strong new evidence on the\nfunctional and design levels that further attributes the RAT variants at our disposal to the same\nTigerRAT malware family. We also show that variants mainly differ in terms of the C2 commands they\nimplement.\n\n\n-----\n\nRAT-KrCERT-x64 FileManager, Keylogger, PortForwarder, ScreenCapture,\nSelfDelete, Shell, SocksTunnel, SystemInfo\n\n_Figure 17: C2 commands found in the different RAT variants._\n\nWe see that the three variants which we have automatically identified using cluster analysis are\nindeed three functionally distinct variants. Apart from these variations in C2 capabilities, the core\ncode of the variants is largely identical. Thus, it is essentially the C2 commands that define the\nthree variants. We also observe that the four commands “FileManager,” “ScreenCapture,”\n“SelfDelete” and “Shell” are common to all variants.\n\n##### A COMMON INTERFACE FOR C2 COMMANDS\n\nWe have found an interface that is common to all three variants, as follows:\n\n\nNext, we’re looking at the C2 commands which are supported by the different variants (see Figure\n17).\n\n**RAT variant** **Commands**\n\nRAT-Kaspersky-x86 FileManager, ScreenCapture, SelfDelete, Shell\n\nRAT-Kaspersky-x64 FileManager, Keylogger, ScreenCapture, SelfDelete, Shell,\nSocksTunnel, SystemInfo\n\nRAT-KrCERT-x64 FileManager, Keylogger, PortForwarder, ScreenCapture,\n\n\n**struct t_Module_GenericCommandInterface**\n{\nt_GenericCommand *Command;\n_DWORD id; // Command id\nt_MainStructure *MainStructure;\n_BYTE unk_data[0x10];\n_BYTE initialized;\n};\n\n**struct t_GenericCommand**\n{\n**void (*init)(t_Module_GenericCommandInterface *a1);**\n**void (*execute)(t_Module_GenericCommandInterface *a1);**\n**void (*enable)(t_Module_GenericCommandInterface *a1);**\n**void (*disable)(t_Module_GenericCommandInterface *a1);**\n**void** *enabled;\n};\n\n\nThe interface provides an abstraction that is implemented by all C2 commands found in the RATs.\nThis common interface establishes a strong relation between the variants within their core C2\nfunctionalities.\n\n\n-----\n\n**struct t_TCP**\n{\n**void (*constructor)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void (*set_cncs)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void (*connect_to_cnc)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void (*check_response_from_cnc)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void (*listen_to_new_commands)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void (*close_socket)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void (*send_data)(t_Module_TCP *a1, t_EncData *a2, int a3);**\n**void (*process_recv_command)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void (*enable_commands)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void** *var_1;\n};\n\n**struct t_TCP_Variant_KrCERT-x64**\n{\n**void (*constructor)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void (*set_cncs)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void (*connect_to_cnc)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void (*check_response_from_cnc)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void (*new_check_from_cnc_response)(t_Module_TCP *a1); // new in RAT-KrCERT-x64 variant**\n**void (*listen_to_new_commands)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void (*close_socket)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void (*send_data)(t_Module_TCP *a1, t_EncData *a2, int a3);**\n**void (*process_recv_command)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void (*enable_commands)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void** *var_1;\n};\n\n\n##### NEW C2 PROTOCOL VARIANT IN RAT-KRCERT-X64\n\nThe C2 protocol is essentially identical across all variants. The exception is a minor protocol change\nwhich we spotted in the RAT-KrCERT-x64 variant. The change concerns the registration of the\nmalware with the C2 and consists of an extra check located in the TCP module, which is responsible\nfor all communication with the C2:\n\n**struct t_TCP**\n{\n**void (*constructor)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void (*set_cncs)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void (*connect_to_cnc)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n**void (*check_response_from_cnc)(t_Module_TCP *a1);**\n\n\nIn Figure 18, the red rectangle contains the new protocol check which was added to the RAT-KrCERTx64 variant.\n\n_Figure 18: Left, other variants; right, RAT-KrCERT-x64 variant._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe new function essentially sends a 17-byte length chunk to the C2. We have not analyzed what\ndata is sent, but it looks like it could be related to a bot identifier or something similar. Once the\ndata is sent, it checks that the C2 returns the string \"n0gyPPx\" (see Figure 19).\n\n\n_Figure 19: C2 protocol check for \"n0gyPPx.\"_\n\nIn addition to this protocol change, we have also observed a change in the HTTP header that is sent\nat the beginning of the communication in the very first request by the RAT-KrCERT-x64 variant (see\nFigure 20).\n\n**RAT variant** **HTTP header**\n\nRAT-KrCERT-x64 HTTP 1.1 /index.php?member=sbi2009 SSL3.3.7\n\nRAT-KrCERT-x64, RAT-Kaspersky-x86 HTTP 1.1 /member.php SSL3.4\n\n_Figure 20: HTTP header variants._\n\nBased on this protocol analysis, we believe that RAT-KrCERT-x64 is a slightly newer version of the\nRAT which is at the same time clearly related to the other versions.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe analysis in this report is based on the malware samples at our disposal at the time of writing.\nDuring our analysis, we found indicators suggesting that additional, not yet publicly known, variants\nmay exist. Since threat analysis and attribution is data driven and evolving work, additional samples\nmay complete our current findings or lead to new findings. We invite you to contact us with\nadditional information, particularly if you can share suspected or confirmed TigerDownloader or\nTigerRAT binaries.\n\n\n### CONCLUSIONS\n\nOur analysis revealed new evidence and insights enabling us to attribute the previously reported\nAndariel APT binaries by Malwarebytes, Kaspersky and KrCERT to two new malware families. We call\nthese the TigerDownloader and TigerRAT families, using names originally introduced by KrCERT.\nWe have also seen that all the binaries are related by the same packing scheme. Our results are\nbased on both automated code-reuse analysis and manual analysis of the malware tooling reported\nin the previous reports.\n\nTo facilitate further research and defense capabilities, we are sharing our unpacking and config-\nextraction scripts as well as data with the community (https://github.com/threatray/tigerrat).\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the other hand, we have found that the compilation dates of the unpacked samples appear\nreasonable and likely correspond to the effective compilation dates. In fact, the unpacked\ncompilation timestamp is always before the first seen date. In many cases, it is 1 to 2 days before the\nfirst seen date which makes sense due to the time delay between the infection/detection and\nreporting/submission to platforms like VirusTotal. Also, none of the dates are in the future or\nunrealistically old. While these still could be false flags, it is reasonable to assume that the\ncompilation dates of the unpacked samples correspond to their effective production date. We also\nsee that most of the 3rd stage (TigerRAT) samples were detected before the 2nd stage\n(TigerDownloader) samples. This could indicate that until a host becomes infected by the 3rd stage,\nthe 2nd stage samples are not detected. It could also be due to the fact that 2nd stage samples are\nstealthier and have fewer features/functions. The raw data is shown in the table below.\n\n\n### APPENDIX\n\n##### ALLEGED COMPILATION DATES\n\nWe have looked at the compilation timestamps of the packed samples and concluded that they are\nrandomly chosen. For instance, some timestamps are in the future (e.g., “2024/06/09”) and others\nmany years in the past (e.g., “1996/10/17”).\n\nOn the other hand, we have found that the compilation dates of the unpacked samples appear\nreasonable and likely correspond to the effective compilation dates. In fact, the unpacked\ncompilation timestamp is always before the first seen date.

To do so, we\ncreated a config extractor for these samples. The following table shows the C2s for each sample. The\n2nd stage samples use a domain whereas the 3rd stage samples directly use an IP address.\n\nNOTE: In the configuration of the 3rd stage there are 4 hardcoded IPs.

We support all key malware defense\nuse cases, including identification / detection, hunting, response, and analysis. Threatray helps\nsecurity teams of all skill levels to effectively identify and analyze ongoing and past compromises.\n\n\nAt the core of Threatray are highly scalable code similarity search algorithms that find code reuse\nbetween a new and millions of known samples in seconds. Our core search algorithms do not make\nuse of traditional byte pattern matches and are thus highly resilient to code mutations.\n\nOur user facing features are based on the core search technology. They include best of class threat\nfamily identification and detection, easy to use real-time retro-hunting and retro-detection, cluster\nanalysis to quickly find relevant IOCs, and low-level multi-binary analysis capabilities. Some of our\nbinary analysis capabilities have been used for the research presented in this report.\n\nContact us at https://threatray.com/contact-us or https://twitter.com/threatray\n\n\n-----",
