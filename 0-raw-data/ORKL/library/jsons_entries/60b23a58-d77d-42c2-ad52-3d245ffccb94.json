We learned that these pages were copied from their\n\n victims’ webmail login pages and subsequently modi�ed for phishing. We\n\n believe further activities are propagated via spear-phishing attacks.\n\n The group’s targets include multiple government and military units, mainly in\n\n Nepal and Afghanistan. After the gathered credentials are sent, some of the\n\n phishing pages will redirect victims to di�erent documents or news pages. The\n\n themes and topics of these pages and documents are related to either Covid\n 19 or recent territory disputes between Nepal, Pakistan, India, and China.\n\n Furthermore, it seems that these lures are distributed via phishing links.\n\n\n### Related Articles\n\nWho is the Threat Actor\n\n[Behind Operation Earth](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/l/who-is-the-threat-actor-behind-operation-earth-kitsune-.html)\n\nKitsune?\n\nOverview of Recent\n\n[Sunburst Targeted](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/l/overview-of-recent-sunburst-targeted-attacks.html)\n\nAttacks\n\nEgregor Ransomware\n\nLaunches String of\n\nHigh-Pro�le Attacks to\n\nEnd 2020\n\n\n### Contact Us\n\n\n-----\n\n## We also found multiple Android APK �les on their phishing server. While some\n\n of them are benign, we also discovered malicious �les created with Metasploit.\n\n One of the normal applications, called “OpinionPoll,” is a survey app for\n\n gathering opinions regarding the Nepal-India political map dispute, which\n\n seems to be another political lure similar to the one they used in the spear\n phishing portion. We believe these applications are still under development\n\n and will likely be used to compromise mobile devices in the future.\n\n SideWinder has been very active in 2020. Earlier this year, we published a\n\n report on how the SideWinder APT group used the Binder exploit to attack\n\n mobile devices. The group also launched attacks against Pakistan, Bangladesh,\n\n and China using lure �les related to Covid-19.\n\n Analysis of the malicious document\n\n The use of malicious documents is one of SideWinder’s most common\n\n infection vectors. We collected several di�erent samples from the campaign,\n\n including:\n\n 1.   An LNK �le that downloads an RTF �le and drops a JavaScript �le\n\n 2.   A ZIP �le containing an LNK �le, which downloads an HTA �le (with\n\n JavaScript)\n\n 3.   An RTF �le that drops a JavaScript �le\n\n 4.   A PDF �le with an embedded JavaScript stream\n\n 5.   A DOCX �le with an external link to an OLE object (RTF �le), which\n\n contains and drops a JavaScript �le\n\n\n**[Archives ](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/trendmicro/en_us/research/09/archive)**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. An example of a downloaded ZIP �le containing an LNK �le that is used to download a malicious\n\nHTA �le\n\n## All of these cases end up with either the downloading or dropping of �les and\n\n then the execution of JavaScript code, which is a dropper used to install the\n\n main backdoor + stealer.\n\n The downloaded RTF �les exploit the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. It drops a\n\n �le named 1.a (a JavaScript code), which drops the backdoor + stealer into a\n\n folder in ProgramData and directly executes it or creates a scheduled task to\n\n execute the dropped �les at a later time.\n\nFigure 2. A scheduled task with a command to execute the dropped backdoor + stealer\n\n## The content of the newly created folder contains a few �les, including\n\n Rekeywiz (EFS REKEY wizard,\n\n FA86B5BC5343CA92C235304B8DCBCF4188C6BE7D4621C625564BEBD5326E\n\n D850), which is a legitimate Windows application.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. List of dropped �les\n\n## This application loads various system DLL libraries, including shell32.dll, which\n\n sideloads DUser.dll, one of shell32’s DelayImports.\n\nFigure 4. DUser library as DelayImport of shell32 library\n\n## However, a fake DUser.dll gets loaded into the process. This fake DLL library\n\n decrypts the main backdoor + stealer from the .tmp �le in the same directory.\n\nFigure 5. Algorithm for decrypting both main backdoor + stealer and con�guration\n\n## The decryption process is a simple XOR, where the key is the �rst 32 bytes\n\n from the encrypted �le and the payload are the remaining bytes. The\n\n decrypted payload is the main backdoor .NET executable binary.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Decrypted main SystemApp with listing its classes and resources\n\n## In Resources, the Default resource contains the encrypted con�guration.\n\n After decryption (using the same principle as with the main backdoor +\n\n stealer), the con�guration reveals which �le formats the attackers are\n\n targeting.\n\nFigure 7. The decrypted con�guration\n\n## The main functions of the backdoor + stealer are:\n\n 1) Downloading the .NET executable and running it\n\n 2) Collecting system information and uploading it to the command-and-control\n\n (C&C) server\n\n 3) Uploading selected �les to the C&C server\n\n\n-----\n\n## The collected information is in JSON format (hence why the Newtonsoft_Json\n\n library stored in Resources is loaded) and includes information such as\n\n privileges, user accounts, computer system information, antivirus programs,\n\n running processes, processor information, operating system information,\n\n timezone, installed Windows updates, network information, list of directories in\n\n Users\\%USERNAME%\\Desktop, Users\\%USERNAME%\\Downloads,\n\n Users\\%USERNAME%\\Documents, Users\\%USERNAME%\\Contacts, as well as\n\n information on all drives and installed apps.\n\n The spear-phishing attack\n\n We found several interesting dynamic DNS domains resolving to a server that\n\n was used to deliver SideWinder’s malicious documents. The subdomains of\n\n these dynamic DNS domains are designed to be similar to the domains of their\n\n victims’ mail servers. For example, “mail-nepalgovnp[.]duckdns[.]org” was\n\n created to pretend to be the original Nepal government’s domain\n\n “mail[.]nepal[.]gov[.]np”. Digging deeper, we found that it hosted several\n\n phishing pages.\n\n These pages were copied from the webmail servers of various targets and then\n\n modi�ed for spear-phishing attacks designed to steal login credentials.\n\n Although it’s not clear to us how these phishing pages are delivered to the\n\n victims, �nding the original webmail servers that they copied to make these\n\n phishing pages allows us to identify who they were targeting.\n\n Analysis of the phishing pages revealed that most of them would redirect to\n\n the original webmail servers, which they copied after the victims sent out their\n\n login credentials. However, we also found some of them will either redirect to\n\n documents or news pages. These documents and news are probably\n\n interesting in some way to their targets and are used to make them click and\n\n log in to the phishing pages. While several of the documents are related to\n\n\n-----\n\n## Covid-19, we also found some documents or news related to territorial issues\n\n in South Asia, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**“India

Interestingly,\n\n these Android applications still seem to be under the initial development\n\n phase as they are basic, still use the default Android icons, and have no\n\n practical function for users.\n\nFigure 11. The default Android icons used by the APKs\n\n\n-----\n\n## We noticed two applications among them, named “My First APP” and “Opinion\n\n Poll,” that seemingly have no malicious behavior. My First APP demonstrates\n\n login & register processes, while Opinion Poll acts as an opinion polling\n\n application for the Indian-Nepalese political map dispute. The �rst application\n\n is likely an Android demo application for beginners, while the second one\n\n starts with an explanation of “Opinion Writing,” followed by a survey.\n\nFigure 12. Non-malicious applications “My First APP” and “Opinion Poll”\n\n## Another two applications were built from JavaPayload for Metasploit that will\n\n load extra code from the remote server con�gured in the sample. While we\n\n were unable to retrieve the payload, according to the Manifest that requests\n\n numerous privacy-related permissions like location, contacts, call logs, etc., we\n\n can infer that it goes after the user’s private data. These two samples appear\n\n to be debug versions as they have no activities or any other component except\n\n Metasploit.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. Build from Metasploit and Request Permissions\n\n## We also identi�ed a malicious version of the My First APP application that\n\n added Metasploit whose class names have been obfuscated.\n\nFigure 14. Malicious version of My First APP, which adds Metasploit\n\n\n-----\n\n## SideWinder has used malicious apps as part of its operation before. In the\n\n campaign referenced earlier, the group used malicious APKs disguised as\n\n photography and �le manager tools to lure users into downloading them.\n\n Once downloaded into the user’s mobile device, the malicious APKs launch a\n\n series of fairly sophisticated procedures that includes rooting the device to\n\n stealthily deploy the payload, as well as exploiting CVE-2019-2215 and\n\n MediaTek-SU vulnerabilities for root privileges. The payload’s ultimate goal is to\n\n gather information from the compromised device and then send it back to its\n\n C&C server.\n\n In the case of these newer APKs, it seems that the goal is to gather user\n\n information as well. Unlike the earlier apps, which were already on the Google\n\n Play Store, all the APK �les found on their server are not mature enough for a\n\n deliberate attack. In our opinion, these are still in the initial stage, and the\n\n payloads (directed at mobile users) are still being re�ned further.\n\n Conclusion\n\n As seen with their phishing attacks and their mobile device tools’ continuous\n\n development, SideWinder is very proactive in using trending topics like Covid\n 19 or various political issues as a social engineering technique to compromise\n\n their targets.
