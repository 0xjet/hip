    "plain_text": "# Lazarus Group APT targeting South Korean users\n\n**[zscaler.jp/blogs/security-research/naver-ending-game-lazarus-apt](https://www.zscaler.jp/blogs/security-research/naver-ending-game-lazarus-apt)**\n\nZscaler’s ThreatLabz research team has been closely monitoring a campaign targeting\nusers in South Korea. This threat actor has been active for more than a year and continues\nto evolve its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); we believe with high confidence\nthat the threat actor is associated with Lazarus Group, a sophisticated North Korean\nadvanced persistent threat (APT) group.\n\nIn 2021, the main attack vector used by this threat actor was credential phishing attacks\nthrough emails, posing as Naver, the popular South Korean search engine and web portal.\n\nIn 2022, the same threat actor started spoofing various important entities in South Korea,\nincluding KRNIC (Korea Internet Information Center), Korean security vendors such as\n**Ahnlab, cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, and others. Some details about this**\n[campaign were published in this Korean blog, however they did not perform the threat](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/4586)\nattribution.\n\nEven though the TTPs of this threat actor evolved over time, there were critical parts of their\ninfrastructure that were reused, allowing ThreatLabz to correlate the attacks and do the\nthreat attribution with a high-confidence level. Our research led us to the discovery of\ncommand-and-control (C2) domains even before they were used in active attacks by the\nthreat actor. This proactive discovery of attacker infrastructure helps us in preempting the\nattacks.\n\nIn this blog, we will share the technical details of the attack chains, and will explain how we\ncorrelated this threat actor to Lazarus.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe would like to thank Dropbox for their quick action in taking down the malicious accounts\nused by the threat actor, and for also sharing valuable threat intelligence that helped us with\nthreat attribution.\n\n## Attack chains\n\nThis threat actor has frequently updated its attack chains over the last two months. We\nidentified three unique attack chains used by the threat actor to distribute the malware in\nemails:\n\n_Figure 1: Attack flow_\n\n## Spear phishing emails distribution\n\nDuring our analysis, we discovered that at least one of the IP addresses (222.112.127[.]9)\nused by the threat actor to log in to the attacker-controlled Dropbox accounts was also used\nto send spear phishing emails to the victims in South Korea.\n\nBelow are examples of two such emails that were sent from the IP address\n**222.112.127[.]9.**\n\n**Note: This IP address is related to KT Corporation, a Korean telecom provider. Multiple IP**\naddresses related to KT Corporation were abused by this threat actor during the current\nattack.\n\n**Email #1**\n\nIn this email, a macro-based document was sent to the victim.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Email sent to the victim_\n\nFigure 3 below shows that the decoy content of the document is related to Menlo Security\ncompany. This is consistent with other decoy contents used by the threat actor. For\ninstance, in the document with MD5 hash: 1a536709554860fcc2c147374556205d, the\ndecoy content used was related to Ahnlab - a Korea-based computer security company.\nThis is done for the purpose of social engineering.\n\n_Figure 3: Decoy content_\n\n**Email #2**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this email, a password protected macro-based XLS file was sent to the victim. The\npassword for the file was mentioned in the email body.\n\nThe theme of the file is related to cryptocurrency investments. This theme is consistent with\nother documents sent in this campaign as well. Lazarus Group is known to have a keen\ninterest in attacking cryptocurrency users, asset managers, and companies.\n\n_Figure 4: Email sent to the victim_\n\nFigure 5 below shows the sender's IP address in the email headers as indicated by the XOriginating-IP field.\n\n_Figure 5: Email header showing originating IP, Sender and Recipient_\n\n## Threat attribution\n\nIn order to perform the threat actor attribution, we did a correlation of the below data points.\n\n**1. C2 IP addresses**\n\n**2. Attacker-controlled Dropbox accounts’ registrant email addresses**\n\n**3 C2 domains’ registrant email addresses**\n\n\n-----\n\n**4. Passive DNS data**\n\n**5. Sender's email address in credential phishing attacks**\n\n**6. Sender's IP address in credential phishing attacks**\n\n**Note: OSINT information related to the above data points was also used in correlation**\nanalysis.\n\n### # Correlating different attacks to same threat actor\n\nAs described in the network communication section later in the blog, the Stage-3 binary\ninitially connects to an attacker-controlled Dropbox account to fetch a C2 domain which is\nused to perform further network communication.\n\nIn collaboration with Dropbox, we were able to discover the email addresses associated\nwith the attacker-controlled Dropbox accounts used during this attack. One such email\n[addresses was: [email protected][.]com](https://www.zscaler.jp/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\nThis same email address was recently mentioned in Prevailion's [blog. It was linked to](https://www.prevailion.com/what-wicked-webs-we-unweave/)\nseveral domains which were used during Naver-themed phishing activity.\n\nAlso, according to this [blog from 2021, this same email address was also used to send](https://blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=mrs_english&logNo=222289029970)\nNaver-themed credential phishing attack emails to users in South Korea.\n\nCorrelating the above data points, we can say with a high confidence level that the attack\nchains we have described in this blog are also related to the same threat actor.\n\n### # Attribution to Lazarus APT\n\nAccording to the threat infrastructure mapping done in Prevailion [blog, the IP address](https://www.prevailion.com/what-wicked-webs-we-unweave/)\n**23.81.246[.]131 belongs to one of the critical nodes used by the threat actor during Naver-**\nthemed phishing activity. One of the domains linked to this IP address was\n**navercorpservice[.]com. If we check the passive DNS data for this domain, we find two**\nother IP address resolutions: 172.93.201[.]253 in November 2021 and 45.147.231[.]213 in\nSeptember 2021.\n\nThe IP address 172.93.201[.]253 was recently used to host the domain **[disneycareers[.]net which was attributed to Lazarus APT in Google TAG blog.](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/countering-threats-north-korea/)**\n\nFurther, what caught our attention was the IP address 45.147.231[.]213. This IP address\nwas earlier used by North Korea-based APT threat actor. Recently, we also had a new\ndomain resolution alert for this IP address as part of our C2 infrastructure tracking. If we\n\n\n-----\n\npivot on the passive DNS data for this IP address, we can see that the domain:\n**www.devguardmap[.]org was hosted on this IP address in Jan 2021 which was attributed**\nto Lazarus APT as per this [tweet from ESET and Google TAG blog.](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1458438155149922312)\n\nCorrelating all the above data points, we reached the conclusion that the attack-chains we\ndiscovered are related to Lazarus threat actor. To the best of our knowledge, at the time of\nwriting, this threat actor attribution has not been publicly documented yet.\n\n## Technical analysis\n\nFor the purpose of technical analysis we will consider the attack chain starting with a\nCompiled HTML file having MD5 210db61d1b11c1d233fd8a0645946074.\n\n### [+] Stage 1: Compiled HTML file\n\nThe CHM file contains a malicious binary embedded inside it. At runtime, this will be\ndropped on the filesystem in the path: C:\\\\programdata\\\\chmtemp\\\\chmext.exe and\nexecuted.\n\nThe code responsible for extracting, dropping and executing the binary is present inside\n1hh.html as shown below.\n\n_Figure 6: HTML code dropping and executing the binary_\n\n### [+] Stage 2: Dropper\n\nThe dropper on execution performs the following operations:\n\n\n-----\n\n**1. Detects sleep patching to identify controlled execution environment such as Sandbox**\nexecution\n\n**2. Checks the name of all the running processes and terminates if it finds a process running**\nwith the name \"v3l4sp.exe\". This process name corresponds to the security software\ndeveloped by Ahnlab (a popular and frequently used security vendor in South Korea).\n\n**3. Creates file in the path \"C:\\ProgramData\\Intel\\IntelRST.exe\"**\n\n**4. XOR decodes the embedded PE from a hardcoded address**\n\n**5. Writes the decoded PE to the file created in Step-3**\n\n**6. Modifies PEB to masquerade itself as explorer.exe**\n\n**7. Executes IntelRST.exe**\n\n**8. Creates RUN registry entry for persistence**\n\n**Value: IntelCUI**\n\n**Data: C:\\ProgramData\\Intel\\IntelRST.exe**\n\n### [+] Stage 3: Dropped binary\n\nThe file IntelRST.exe dropped by the Stage-2 dropper is an ASpacked binary. On execution\nit performs the following operations:\n\n**1. Similar to the dropper binary it tries to detect sleep patching to identify controlled**\nexecution environment\n\n**2. Collects machine information and stores using the specified format which is later**\nexfiltrated and used as machine identifier.\n\n**String format:**\n\n[decoded_string]_[username]_[volume_serial_number_post_8_bytes]\n\n**decoded_string: (encoded string) ^ (key) [encoded_string_byte_offset%keySize]**\n\n**username: GetUserName()**\n\n**volume_serial _number: Using DeviceIoControl with**\nIOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY (0x2d1400)\n\n**3. Checks name of all the running processes and terminates if there is some process**\nrunning with the name \"v3l4sp.exe\" or \"AYAgent.aye\" or \"IntelRST.exe\"\n\n\n-----\n\n**4. If running with administrator privileges then it executes a PowerShell command using**\ncmd.exe to add WindowsDefender exclusion.\n\n**PowerShell command: Powershell -Command Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath**\n\"C:\\ProgramData\\Intel\\IntelRST.exe\n\n**5. Finally it starts the network communication**\n\n### [+] Network communication\n\nThe network communication occurs in the following sequence:\n\n**1. Send a GET request to the URL**\n\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/k288s9tu2o53v41/zs_url.txt?dl=0\".\n\n**2. Query the file size and send another network request to read the file content.**\n\n**Note: The file content points to the C2 domain to be used for rest of the network**\ncommunication.\n\n**3. Using the extracted C2 domain, send a POST request to the path \"/post.php\" and**\nexfiltrate collected user information.\n\n**Exfiltrated user information format:**\n\nuid={string_generated_in_Step-2_of_Stage3_binary}&avtype=%d&majorv=%d&minorv=%d\n\n**4. Finally send a GET request to the path \"/{decoded_string_from_step-2_of_Stage-**\n3_binary}/{formated_string_from_step-2_of_Stage-3_binary}/fecommand.acm\"\n\n**Note: At the time of analysis we didn't get any active response from the C2 server for the**\nabove network request.\n\n## Zscaler Cloud Sandbox detection\n\n**# Document detection**\n\n\n-----\n\n**# Dropper detection**\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\n**[+] Hashes**\n\n**MD5** **Description**\n\n\n-----\n\n37505b6ff02a679e70885ccd60c13f3b\n\nc156572dd81c3b0072f62484e90e47a0\n\nd7f6b09775b8d90d79404eda715461b7\n\na0f565f7f579f0d397a42db5a95d4ae8\n\ne2e5644e77e75e422bde075f409d882e\n\n37b7415442ab8ca01e08b2d7bfe809e2\n\nd19dd02cf375d0d03f557556d5207061\n\ne3ffda448df223b240a20dae41e20cef\n\ne732bc87033a935bd2d3d56c7772641b\n\n825730d9dd22dbae7f2bd89131466415\n\nc32f40f304777df7cfab428a54bb818b\n\nb587851d8a42fc8c23f638bbc2eb866b\n\n4382384feb5ad6b574f68e431006905e\n\n493f59b6933e59029bf3106fd4a2998d\n\nbdfb5071f5374f5c0a3714464b1fa5e6\n\n1769a818548a0b52c7be2a0a213a9384\n\n7b07cd6bb6b5d4ed6a2892a738fe892b\n\n9775ef6514916977d73e39a6b09029bc\n\n44be20c67a80af8066f9401c5bee43cb\n\n15a7125fe9e629122e1d1389062af712\n\n1fd8fef169bf48cfdcf506151264128c\n\n9ad00e513364e9f44f1b6712907cba9b\n\n1a536709554860fcc2c147374556205d\n\na2aca7b66f678b85fc7b4015af21c5ee\n\nbd416ea51f94d815b5b5b66861cbdcc5\n\necb2d07ede5a401c83a5fca8e00fa37a\n\ndb0483aced77a7db130a6100aef67967\n\n\nDocument\n\nDocument (Template based)\n\n\n-----\n\nc0b24dc8f53227ce0c64439b302ca930\n\nbb9ee3a6504fbf6a5486af04dbbb5da5\n\nce00749c908de017010055a83ac0654f\n\n2677f9871cb340750e582cb677d40e81\n\n90f2b7845c203035f0d7096aa28dda83\n\n044e701e8d288075b0fb6cd118aa94db\n\n556abc167348fe96abfbf5079c3ad488\n\n0ef32b48f6ca3a1a22ab87058b3d8aa0\n\n4548c7f157d300ec39b1821db4daa970\n\n430d944786e05042cdbe1d795ded2199\n\n96d86472ff283f6959b7a779f004dfba\n\n137910039cb94c0301154f3d1ec9ba29\n\n728b908e90930c73edeb1bf58b6a3a64\n\n1559aeb8e464759247e4588cb6a09877\n\n6df608342938f0d30a058c48bb9d8d4d\n\n78aa7e785a96f2826ee09a1aa9ab776e\n\n0c2dde41d508941cf215fe8f1f7e03a7\n\n783e7c3ba39daa28301b841785794d76\n\na225b7aff737dea737cd969fb307df23\n\n210db61d1b11c1d233fd8a0645946074\n\ne25ac08833416b8c7191639b60edfa21\n\n114f22f3dd6928bed5c779fa918a8f11\n\n**[+] File names**\n\n\nTemplate\n\nCompiled HTML (CHM)\n\n\n**Original Name** **Translated Name**\n\n\n-----\n\n확진자 및 동거인 안내문\n(50).chm\n\n메타콩즈가이드_1900002.chm\n\nNFT Metakongz Minting.chm\n\n202204_암호화폐_투자기\n획.docx\n\n사건 경위서.docx\n\n마산합포구 400억 대출요청.docx\n\n40억_자금투자계약서.docx\n\n긴급재난지원금신청서양식.docx\n\n대한광산개발(주).docx\n\n크립토스_로그인.docx\n\n**[+] C2 domains**\n\nnaveicoipg[.]online\n\nnaveicoipf[.]online\n\nnaveicoipc[.]tech\n\nnaveicoipa[.]tech\n\nnaveicoipe[.]tech\n\nnaveicoipd[.]tech\n\nnaveicoipep[.]tech\n\nnaveicoiph[.]online\n\nnaveicoipg[.]tech\n\nnaveicoipf[.]tech\n\nnaveicoipb[.]tech\n\nnaveicoipj[.]online\n\nnaveicoipi[.]online\n\nnaveicoipe[.]online\n\nnaveicoipd[.]online\n\nnaveicoipc[.]online\n\nnaveicoipb[.]online\n\nnaveicoipa[.]online\n\nnaveicoipc[.]com\n\nnaveicoipa[.]com\n\n\nGuide to confirmed cases and living with them\n(50).chm\n\nMeta Kong's Guide_190002.chm\n\nNFT Metakongz Minting.chm\n\n202204_Cryptocurrency_Investment Planning.docx\n\nincident report.docx\n\nMasanhappo-gu 40 billion loan request.docx\n\n4 billion_fund investment contract.docx\n\nEmergency Disaster Subsidy Application Form.docx\n\nDaehan Mine Development Co., Ltd. docx\n\ncryptos_login.docx\n\n\n-----\n\nnaveicoip[.]com\nnaveicoiph[.]tech\n\nnaveicoip[.]tech\n\nnaveicorp[.]com\n\ncopycatfrag[.]store\n\nknightsfrag[.]store\n\nparfumeparlour[.]store\n\n**# New domain resolutions for the IP 23.81.246[.]131**\n\nnavernidb[.]link\n\nnavermailteam[.]online\n\nnavermailservice[.]com\n\nmailservicecorp[.]online\n\nmailhelp[.]online\n\nmailcustomerservice[.]site\n\ncloudcentre[.]xyz\n\nnaverservice[.]host\n\nmailserviceteam[.]email\n\nnavermcorp[.]com\n\nnaverserviceteam[.]com\n\nnaversecurityteam[.]com\n\nnavermanageteam[.]com\n\nnavermailmanage[.]com\n\nnavercorpservice[.]com\n\nnavermailcorp[.]com\n\nnaversecurityservice[.]online\n\nnavermailservice[.]online\n\nnavercorp[.]live\n\nnavercscorp[.]com\n\nnavermanage[.]live\n\nnavermanage[.]com\n\nnavernidmail[.]com\n\nnoreplya[.]xyz\n\n**[+] Emails**\n\n**# Dropbox accounts associated email addresses**\n\n[[email protected][.]com](https://www.zscaler.jp/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\n[[email protected][.]com](https://www.zscaler.jp/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\n[[email protected][.]com](https://www.zscaler.jp/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\n\n-----\n\n**[+] PDB path**\n\nD:\\Works\\PC_2022\\ACKS_2012\\fengine\\Release\\fengine.pdb\n\n## About us\n\n[Zscaler ThreatLabz is a global threat research team with a mission to protect customers](https://www.zscaler.com/threatlabz/)\nfrom advanced cyberthreats.
