Those that succeed call on past experience to proactively develop their readiness for inevitable future risks. The measures they take are pre-emptive and continuous. For organizations considering the impacts of a cyber attack, there is much to be learnt from this “ready” mindset.\n\n Cyber attacks are a business reality, with 75% of organizations in the UK having experienced one between March 2019 and March 2020[1]. However, the impact of the attack and the damage caused, can be mitigated. Depending on an organization’s incident response (IR) and crisis management efforts, an attack with the potential to disrupt business continuity may have little impact. This can be achieved by anticipating incidents and developing a response around specific threats, their likelihood, and the motives of the attacker. It is never the result of a defensive arsenal of technology on its own.\n\n##### “There are organizations that are​ spending a ton on cyber security and they have very bad risk postures. There are others that are not spending very much but they have very good risk postures. The bottom line is it’s about their level of readiness.”​ – Paul Proctor, VP, Gartner\n\n1 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2020/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2020\n\n\n-----\n\n## PROACTIVE VS REACTIVE RESPONSE\n\nReadiness—in the context of cyber incidents—can be understood as a\nstate of being and working to continually be prepared for compromise,\nsuch that business continuity can be maintained throughout an attack.\nIt is both the measurement of an organization’s current security posture\nand a set of actions. The latter, when improved, can increase overall\norganizational resilience.\n\nReadiness can be aligned with the “preparation” phase in the IR lifecycle\n(see fig.1.), influencing all successive phases. It is broad in scope and\ndesigned to begin as far in advance of an incident as possible; this\npreparation phase may take place months or even years before an\nincident. Although this preparation phase is fundamental to IR as a\npractice, it is commonly overlooked.\n\nPREPARATION IDENTIFICATION CONTAINMENT ERADICATION RECOVERY LEARNINGS\n\nFig. 1. Incident response lifecycle\n\n## INCIDENT READINESS IN ACTION\n\nThe following walkthrough is based on real IR engagements and\ncontrasts the same attack being deployed against two near identical\norganizations in the financial sector. It illustrates the success of response\nwith and without prior readiness activity and welcomes the reader to\nmake their own judgement about the value of incident readiness and\nhow they may apply such a mindset in their own organization.\n\n\n-----\n\n## SETTING THE SCENE\n\n###### ENTERPRISE-A\n\nEnterprise-A has a workforce of 500,000 employees, and operations\nin several geographic regions. One central group security function\nexists in addition to local security representatives in each regional\noffice. Regions are responsible for their own security function and\ndetection technology; no monitoring of this technology takes place\nat the central security group level.\n\nSecurity initiatives include penetration testing for applications,\ninfrastructure, and networks. Some policies and processes for IR exist,\nbut are not widely understood due to a lack of training.\n\n\n###### ENTERPRISE-B\n\nEnterprise-B is identical in profile to Enterprise-A, except that it has\nrecently undertaken an incident readiness project including the\nfollowing elements:\n\n- IR plans and playbooks developed at the regional level\n\n- First responder training in place for both group and regional staff\n\n- Tabletop incident simulation exercises carried out on a regular\nbasis for each region, with group security playing the role of\nincident management\n\n- Review of the central logging solution that collects and\naggregates key logs, with an emphasis on logging strategy and\npolicy for priority assets within group and regional offices\n\n- A review of high privilege accounts and the management thereof\n\n\n-----\n\n## INCIDENT PHASE 1: INITIAL BREACH\n\n###### ENTERPRISE-A\n\n DAY 1\n\nThe third-party developer responsible for developing and\nmaintaining the organization’s money transfer application contacts\na representative from head office—suspicious files have appeared\non the application servers of two regional offices. These files were\nnot uploaded by the development team, which is the only team with\naccess to the servers.\n\n###### DAY 10\n\nGroup security at head office contacts the region where the\nsuspicious files have been identified. It transpires that the office is\nreceiving numerous client complaints regarding small, unrecognized\ntransactions from their accounts. The application owner is currently\ninvestigating the matter but is unsure of the cause at present.\n\n###### DAY 21\n\nThe developers are instructed by group security to delete the\nsuspicious files and report any further unusual file activity on other\nregional servers.\n\nGroup security investigates the unrecognized transactions in the\ntransaction logs and discovers a possible authentication flaw, which\nallows authentication keys to be reused. The team issues a patch and\ndistributes it to all regions where the application is hosted.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ENTERPRISE-B\n\n DAY 1\n\nUpon receiving notification from the development team about a\nsuspicious file on the application servers for its money transfer\napplication, a ticket is raised and assigned as a low-risk priority.\nAn analyst from the group security team calls the developer who\nraised the notification. They ask them to share their screen to enable\na two-way discussion about the suspicious nature of the file. The\nservers are Linux, so the developer logs on via Secure Shell (SSH) and\nprints the file contents to the shared screen.\n\nThe analyst takes note of the file contents:\n\n```\n#<?php\n/***********************************************\n********************************\n * Copyright 2017 WhiteWinterWolf\n * https://www.whitewinterwolf.com/tags/phpwebshell/\n *\n\n```\n- This file is part of wwolf-php-webshell.\n```\n *\n * wwwolf-php-webshell is free software: you can\nredistribute it and/or modify\n * it under the terms of the GNU General Public\nLicense as published by\n * the Free Software Foundation, either version\n3 of the License, or\n * (at your option) any later version.\n\n```\n\nA quick Google search of the string “WhiteWinterWolf” confirms that\nthe files are web shells. The application servers are now considered\ncompromised, so the analyst raises the ticket priority and directs the\ninfrastructure team to snapshot the virtual server’s hard drives. These\nsnapshots are sent for forensic analysis.\n\nOperational obligations and a lack of functional backup servers\nprohibit the affected servers from being taken offline. Instead,\nthe analyst locates the security team’s incident playbook for host\ncompromise and follows the instructions to generate a hash for the\nsuspicious file in question. The hash is sent as part of a notification to\nall regions, advising them to search for instances of the file on their\nservers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### DAY 10\n\nFurther investigation leads the analyst to a string of client complaints\nabout unauthorized transactions on their accounts. After requesting\napplication transaction logs for review, they quickly identify that an\nauthentication key has been reused for two different accounts. This\nindicates an authentication flaw in the application. As the web shell\nand the unauthorized transactions are linked, the risk of the incident\nis reassessed by the incident manager; the decision is made to\nengage an external IR provider.\n\nVirtual hard drive snapshots and the accompanying logs are sent to\nthe provider for analysis.\n\nWhilst the hard drive snapshots and logs are processed, Enterprise-B\nreceives guidance from the IR provider to increase monitoring on the\naffected assets. Over the next few days, a Linux endpoint detection\nand response (EDR) agent and updated AV signatures are deployed\nto the application servers and the logs are actively monitored by the\nsecurity team.\n\n**DAY 21**\n\nAn update on the investigation thus far is received from the IR\nprovider. It details the following:\n\n- External reconnaissance activity is visible in the local server logs\n\n- A web shell was uploaded via the file upload functionality of a web\napplication used by the developers to upload and maintain code\non the server\n\n- Additional malware was then installed, allowing the attacker to\ninteract directly with the server\n\n- The attacker was able to view the transaction logs stored in\nclear text on the server, where they were able to access the\nauthentication keys\n\n- There is some indication that the attacker is using the application\nAPI directly from the server via the GNU Wget functionality\n\nGroup security establishes an internal cyber security incident\nresponse team (CSIRT)[2] and convenes to discuss the incident and its\nremediation. Representatives are involved from every region.\n\nIt becomes clear that the attacker has a foothold on all the regional\napplication servers. Their objective is also clear: to extract funds by\ntransferring money between accounts directly from the application\nservers. The initial malicious transactions of nominal amounts were\ndesigned to assess the effectiveness of this approach.\n\n2 https://www.f-secure.com/content/dam/f-secure/en/consulting/our-thinking/collaterals/digital/F-Secure-Consulting-Blue-Team-paper-2020.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\nThe CSIRT decides to issue a temporary patch, stopping the\nauthentication key from being reused. Monitoring on the servers is\nincreased while the application team builds a new application server\nfor distribution to the affected regions.\n\n**DAY 34**\n\nThe new server image and patched application undergo a penetration\ntest before being deployed as the replacement in all regions.\nApproval of the single server image and application version happens\nquickly to avoid any further operational issues. It is imperative that all\nvulnerabilities are addressed before deployment to the regions.\n\n\n-----\n\n## INCIDENT PHASE 2: DOMAIN COMPROMISE\n\n###### ENTERPRISE-A\n\n DAY 182\n\nAn anti-virus alert is triggered on three servers in the regional office\nwhere activity on the application servers was first observed. The\nalerts indicate use of the credential harvesting tool Mimikatz[3].\n\nAn administrator is assigned to log on to the affected hosts using the\nlocal administrator account. Their attempts to identify the alerted\nfiles are ineffectual, as they have been successfully quarantined and\nare not present on disk.\n\n###### DAY 190\n\nAfter speaking to the administrator, the security manager concludes\nthat the threat has been contained by the anti-virus solution. The\nadministrator had attempted to extract the Windows event logs but\nadvised that the logs had since rolled over and were not preserved.\nEvery user password within the regional office network is reset as a\nprecaution and the investigation is closed off.\n\n3 https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz\n\n\n-----\n\n**ENTERPRISE-B**\n\n**Day 182**\n\nAn anti-virus alert triggers an investigation into three servers in a\nregional office. The regional security manager creates a ticket and\nassigns it as medium risk due to the nature of the alert—that a known\nhacking tool has triggered alerts on multiple servers. The security\nmanager instructs the administrator to take snapshots of the virtual\nservers and capture the event logs as per the first responder process.\n\nMeanwhile, the security manager reviews the access logs in the security\ninformation and event management (SIEM) system to identify any\naccounts that have recently logged on to the servers. One account\nstands out as anomalous, as it belongs to a manager in the money\ntransfer application team. This account has never previously accessed\nthe servers. Despite no business case, it also has local administrator\npermissions for them.\n\n**Day 183**\n\nThe security manager consults the application manager, and it is\nconcluded that the activity was not legitimately performed by the\norganization. After arranging a replacement laptop for the application\nmanager, the security manager takes possession of the infected laptop.\nA forensic imaging tool is used to capture a disk image of the laptop\nonto an encrypted external hard drive, as per the instructions in the first\nresponder guide.\n\nThe external hard drive and copies of the server snapshots are shipped\nvia courier with next-day delivery to group security for forensic\ninvestigation. The team has already been briefed on the incident and the\nincident ticket is updated with relevant details.\n\nThe password for the administrator account is reset and the affected\nservers are restored from a previous backup.\n\n**Day 185**\n\nGroup security forms a CSIRT with key representatives from the security,\ninfrastructure, and executive teams. The decision is made to engage\nEnterprise-B’s external IR provider for reinforcement. The organization’s\nincident manager invokes its incident response retainer and briefs the\nprovider’s consultants on what is known thus far. All available artifacts\nare shared with the consultants for analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DAY 191**\n\nThe investigation conducted by the IR consultants highlights the\nfollowing events:\n\n- The application manager was sent a phishing email containing a\nlink to a fake Linkedin profile three weeks prior to the first antivirus alerts. A two-stage payload was then downloaded onto their\nhost. As the user had local administrator permissions, a registry\nkey was used for persistence of the payload\n\n- Several randomly-named text files were found in the C:\\Windows\\\nTemp\\ directory of the laptop, which appear to be the output\nof a keylogger. These include the contents of emails, as well\nas passwords for internal platforms. The latter includes the\nSSH password to a jumpbox that provides access to the Linux\nenvironment where the application servers are hosted\n\n- The application manager’s credentials were then used to log on\nto the three servers flagged by the anti-virus alerts\n\n- The investigation streams for the servers are ongoing. The\nIR provider has so far identified a folder containing several\nexecutable files on each server. These executables appear to have\nbeen used by the attacker for enumeration\n\n- One such executable file named “<COMPANY_NAME>.exe”\nhas been submitted to the malware analysis team for reverse\nengineering to scrutinize its structure and purpose. Preliminary\nanalysis indicates that some extracted strings have keylogging\ncapability and that the executable is a custom piece of malware\n\n**DAY 193**\n\nAs a result of these findings, group security meets to assess the threat\nand plan remediation. The consequent actions are informed by both\nthe findings and are in line with its domain compromise playbook:\n\n- Exchange administrators from each region are instructed to\nsearch for instances of the phishing email in their regional user\nbase. Those regions with a proxy are instructed to search the\nproxy logs for the phishing URL\n\n- A list of hashes for the files identified in the attacker’s tool folder\nis sent to each regional office. It comes with instruction for the\nregional security teams to use their anti-virus solution to search\nfor instances of these on their estates\n\n- The regional administrator for the Linux environment hosting the\nmoney transfer application is instructed to search for instances of\nlogons using the compromised application manager’s credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DAY 198**\n\nWhile no other instances of the phishing email are found, the malware\nhash search shows hits on six additional servers in the region where\nthe malicious files were first identified. The additional server list\nincludes a domain controller.\n\nNo anomalous authentication events are identified in the Linux\nenvironment. However, it is recognized that limitations in the logging\nprohibit evidence being collected across the entire period of interest.\n\nThe administrator increases the log retention policy to 60 days, resets\nall user credentials, and hardens the firewall rules to ensure that only\nlisted IP addresses can access the Linux servers. A collection script\nis run on all Linux hosts in the environment, the output of which is\nshared with the IR provider for analysis.\n\n**DAY 201**\n\nFollowing the processes and playbook guidance defined for regional\ndomain compromise, group security obtains executive approval to\nsever the domain trust between the affected region and head office.\n\nThe following instructions are sent to the regional security team to\neradicate the threat:\n\n1. Restore backups of the affected servers from one month ago[4]\n2. Reset all user and administrator passwords via Active Directory\n(AD)\n3. Reset the KRBTGT password as per Microsoft’s best practice guide\n4. Identify additional accounts which may have excessive privileges\n5. Increase monitoring for all affected assets\n6. Monitor for operational impact and report back to group security\n7. Schedule a domain hardening assessment with the organization’s\ncyber security partner\n\nBy following these processes, Enterprise-B prevents the potential\nbusiness impact of the attack and successfully contains the incident.\nIt may now evaluate the incident with its IR provider and report back\nto the business. As part of the lessons learned process defined in\neach of the organization’s playbooks, the CSIRT conducts a meeting\nto discuss the information ascertained during the incident. An action\nplan to address the identified shortcomings is developed during the\nmeeting, and the resulting actions list is assigned to key individuals\nfor completion.\n\n4 The IR provider confirms these are clean, as they predate the servers’ compromise. The executive team know that the backup restoration may cause\nsome business impact and loss of production data. Stakeholders are on standby to deal with any fallout.\n\n\n-----\n\n## INCIDENT PHASE 3: ATTACKER CASH-OUT\n\n###### ENTERPRISE-A\n\n DAY 362 (ATTACKER OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED)\n\nEnterprise-A receives an influx of reports from clients who have lost\nsignificant sums of money through its money transfer application.\nThese come from multiple regions. The organization’s executive\nteam convenes a crisis management meeting with group security\nand regional security representatives to investigate and control the\nsituation.\n\nAn external IR provider is engaged and briefed on the findings so\nfar. The provider requests the following artifacts to support the\ninvestigation:\n\n- Disk images from the Linux application servers\n\n- Transaction logs from the money transfer application\n\n- Firewall logs for the Linux environment\n\n###### DAY 368\n\nAs most of the application server disk images need to be couriered\nfrom the respective regions, limited artifacts are available for analysis.\nOne disk image of a regional application server and some network\nlogs are provided initially.\n\nPreliminary findings reveal that malware has been running on the host\nfor over a year. The transaction logs again show that authentication\nkeys have been reused in money transfers, for different accounts, via\nthe API on the application server. The patch issued by group security\nto prevent the reuse of authentication keys was reversed by the\nattacker shortly before the bulk of the transactions took place.\n\nA timeline of key events from the attack confirms that the provided\ndisk image was not the first in the attack chain. The region where\nthe domain compromise occurred a few months prior is instead\ndetermined as the attack’s most likely origin. This conclusion is drawn\nfrom the timestamps of the fraudulent transactions and connections\non the firewall. Due to the time that has passed since this point, the\navailable historic evidence is limited.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DAY 376**\n\nAdditional disk images are received for analysis from the regional\noffices, including the region suspected as the starting point for the\nattack.\n\n**DAY 386**\n\nThe attacker’s foothold on the Linux servers is confirmed to originate\nfrom the corporate Windows environment, with the source of\nthe SSH connection being the application manager’s host. The IR\nprovider requests a disk image of the host, and the laptop is shipped\nto head office for analysis; the absence of equipment or experience\nto acquire a disk image prohibits the regional security team to do so\nindependently. This significantly hinders the investigation and causes\na substantial delay in the analysis process.\n\nNo connection exists between the regional application servers. The\nservers in each region were individually compromised, rather than via\nlateral movement. Each was compromised via web shells uploaded\nvia the developer’s code maintenance application, followed by the\ninstallation of persistent malware.\n\nThe development team concedes that it could see the web shells\nbeing created and wrote a script to delete any files matching the\nnames of said shells. They did not notify the organization, as they\nbelieved appropriate mitigation steps were taken by deleting the\nfiles.\n\nThe IR provider identifies variations of the web shells, which were not\ndeleted by the developer’s script. This is the mechanism that allowed\nthe attacker to maintain persistence on the application servers.\n\n**DAY 399**\n\nThe laptop belonging to the application manager is received. It\ntakes the regional team a few hours to find and provide its BitLocker\nrecovery key, after which time the IR provider acquires a disk image\nand begins analysis.\n\n**Day 416**\n\nSignificant time has passed since the domain compromise, and many\nlaptop artifacts have rolled over or been overwritten. The IR provider\nhighlights that the host was compromised when the user clicked a\nphishing URL. Custom malware is also running on the host as well\nas the suspected output from a keylogger. Another investigation is\nlaunched to determine if the domain controller is still compromised.\n\n\n-----\n\n## POST-INCIDENT LEARNINGS\n\nFollowing extensive forensic investigation, remediation of the\nincident takes several iterations. These cause long periods of\noperational downtime for Enterprise-A, impacting the business.\nThe investigation finds that the attacker targeted the organization\none year prior to their objectives being reached. They maintained\npersistence on several key assets during this time and systematically\ngathered data that would later inform and enable their final attack.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, three key detection events are\nidentified. These represent the point at which incident response\nprocesses could have been invoked and may ultimately have resulted\nin a different outcome for Enterprise-A.\n\nEnterprise-A’s response approach is illustrated via the following\nkey detection events, the response action taken for each, and the\nsubsequent impact.\n\n#### REACTIVE RESPONSE\n\n###### DETECTION EVENT RESPONSE IMPACT\n\n**Developer alert:** No investigation; true root\n\nDeveloper instructed to\n\n###### 1 suspicious file on cause not known, servers still\n\ndelete suspicious files\n\napplication server vulnerable\n\nReview logs, identify Patch stops attackers from\n\n**Client alert: strange**\n\nauthentication being able to transfer funds,\n\n###### 2 transactions on money\n\nvulnerability, create and but persistence means they\n\ntransfer application\n\ndeploy a patch can disable controls\n\nDomain compromise means\n\n###### 3 High risk AV alert on Delete malicious files, that the attacker can gather\n\nWindows servers in region reset user credentials important data for over a year\n\nto inform final attack\n\nFig. 2. Points of detection, response, and impact within a reactive response approach\n\n\n-----\n\nFollowing the investigation’s conclusion, critical gaps in Enterprise-A’s\nreadiness posture are identified. At a minimum, the following highlevel readiness measures could reduce the impact of incidents of this\nnature:\n\n- The creation of an IR plan detailing relevant regulations,\nthresholds, incident severity levels, escalation matrices, and\nroles and responsibilities to be assumed during a cyber security\nincident\n\n- The development of IR playbooks detailing high-level process\nflows for different categories of incidents; these would include\nincident management at the global level and incident categories\nat the regional level\n\n- First responder training for regional representatives to\nadvocate their responsibility for preserving evidence in suitable\ncircumstances. This would also provide them with the skills\nrequired to conduct initial analysis from triaged data\n\n- Incident response simulations developed and delivered\nsystematically to each region, encouraging buy-in from the\nregional offices for the incident response plan and playbook\n\nWe can now consider what a proactive response may have looked like\nfor Enterprise-A had the above elements been in place at the time of\nthe incident:\n\n#### PROACTIVE RESPONSE\n\n###### PREPARATION DETECTION EVENT RESPONSE IMPACT\n\n**First Responder training:** **Developer alert:** Snapshot virtual server hard\n\n**1** staff are aware of how and suspicious file on drives and send for root\n\nwhen to preserve artifacts application server cause analysis\n\n**Incident response**\n**policy detailing roles** Root cause analysis (RCA),\n\n**Client alert: strange**\n\nand responsibilities, review logs, identify\n\n**2** transactions on money\n\nbusiness owners, change authentication vulnerability,\n\ntransfer application\n\nmanagement, and patching create and deploy a patch\nprocess\n\nCapture forensic artifacts,\n\n**Playbooks exist for host** **High risk AV alert on**\n\nroot cause analysis, isolate\n\n**3** compromise and domain Windows servers\n\nand rebuilt according to and credential theft avoided\n\nrecovery in one region\n\nplaybooks\n\nFig. 2. Points of preparation, detection, response, and impact within a proactive response approach\n\n\n-----\n\nEnterprises that prioritize readiness are better equipped to raise\nthe barriers between advanced persistent threats (APTs) and their\ngoals, prior to a compromise. Such threats are systematic and\nrequire sufficient resource to succeed. By preserving key data and\ndeveloping learnings early in the kill-chain, the resource required\nby the attacker diminishes the value of its persistence. Instead of\nrelying on prevention, and responding reactively when it fails, this\napproach proactively deters threats by making an organization an\nuneconomical target.\n\n\n-----\n\n## SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nAn organization’s ability to maintain business continuity through a\ncyber incident, and recover any losses in the aftermath, is dependent\non its governance of the IR lifecycle. This includes the preparation\nphase where controlled and strategic actions can be taken, based on\nlearnings from tabletop exercises, capability-specific assessments,\nand real attacks.\n\nExamples like the one in this paper show that preparation reaches\nbeyond the deployment, configuration, and testing of tooling. Whilst\nsuitable tooling is essential, it cannot provide incident readiness on\nits own. Instead, its inclusion alongside strategic management of\npeople and processes—via continually-improved IR plans, playbooks,\nand low-level procedures—make for an effective response\nOperational resilience during a real incident is the result of skilled risk\nmanagement and the technical ability of the CSIRT, in addition to the\nperformance of tooling.\n\nFor the internal CSIRT managing the frontline during a compromise,\nproactive response can help circumvent burnout and improve\nchannels of communication with the executive team. Such crossdepartmental collaboration is a step towards security becoming a\nbusiness priority.\n\nIncidents are indeed a business consideration not a pure technical\none. The scrutiny of customers, partners, regulators, and the media\nthat results from an incident forms the case to develop security teams\nequipped to defend against modern threat actors—both constantly\nevolving and persistent in nature. The value of readiness investment\ncan be represented to senior stakeholders in this context as a route to\nincreased credibility, continuity, and growth.\n\n\n-----\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n**1.
