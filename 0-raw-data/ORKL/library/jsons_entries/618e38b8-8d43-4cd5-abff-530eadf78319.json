Summary information\n\nThe Gaza cybergang is an Arabic-language, politically-motivated cybercriminal group, operating since 2012 and actively targeting the MENA\n(Middle East North Africa) region. The Gaza cybergang’s attacks have never slowed down and its typical targets include government\nentities/embassies, oil and gas, media/press, activists, politicians, and diplomats.\n\nOne of the interesting new facts, uncovered in mid-2017, is its discovery inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region, infiltrating\nsystems and pilfering data, apparently for more than a year.\n\nAnother interesting finding is the use of the recently discovered CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability, and Microsoft Access files into which the\ndownload scripts were embedded to reduce the likelihood of their detection. Traces of mobile malware that started to appear from late April\n2017, are also being investigated.\n\nRecent targets for the group seem to be varied in nature; the attackers do not appear to be choosing targets selectively, but rather seeking\ndifferent kinds of MENA intelligence.\n\nSome of the interesting new updates about the Gaza cybergang:\n\nGaza cybergang attackers have continued their interest in government entities in MENA\nNew targets identified include oil and gas in MENA\nNew tools and techniques include\n\nAbuse of the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability\n\n\n-----\n\nUsage o ac os s de c oso t ccess es, e ab g o e detect o ates\nPossible Android mobile malware being used by attackers\n\n**Previous published research:**\n[https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergang-wheres-your-ir-team/72283/](https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergang-wheres-your-ir-team/72283/)\n\n**Kaspersky Lab products and services successfully detect and block Gaza cybergang attacks, detection names below:**\n\nHEUR:Exploit.MSOffice.Generic\nHEUR:Trojan.Win32.Cometer.gen\nHEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic\nTrojan-Downloader.Win32.Downeks\nTrojan-Spy.MSIL.Downeks\nWin32.Bublik\nWin32.Agentb\n\nMore information about Gaza cybergang is available to customers of the Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting Service. Contact:\n[intelreports@kaspersky.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## 2. Technical details\n\nPreviously, Gaza cybergang attacks were surprisingly successful in using simple and common tools to achieve their goals. They relied on a\nvariety of Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to perform their activities, including Downeks, Qasar, Cobaltstrike…\n\nAs recently as June 2017, however, the attackers started using the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability which enables direct code execution from a\nMicrosoft office document on non-patched victim systems (Cobaltstrike payload in this case). Another finding is a possible Android Trojan that\nthe attackers positioned on one of their command servers in April 2017.\n\nIn most cases, malware is sent by email as a compressed attachment or download links. Starting from March 2017, we have observed\ndownloaders or Microsoft office documents with embedded macros being sent to victims. When opened, the downloader would contact a URL\nor IP address to retrieve the actual payload. Once successfully executed, the malware grants full access to the attackers, providing them with\nthe ability to collect files, keystrokes and screenshots from victims’ devices. If the initial downloaded malware was detected by the victim, the\ndownloader would attempt to retrieve other malware files to the victim’s device, in the hope that one of those files would work.\n\nThe full list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) can be found in Appendix I. The list of the most interesting lure content, malware files and\nrelated droppers, and command servers can be found in Appendix II.\n\n## 3.

New findings\n\n\n-----\n\nGa a Cybe ga g attac e s a e bee co t uous y e o g t e s s o d e e t e e s, us g e et ods a d tec ques to de e\nmalware, in addition to adapting social engineering decoys to regional political and humanitarian incidents.\n\nIn mid-2017, the attackers were discovered inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region, infiltrating systems and pilfering data,\napparently for more than a year. The malware files that were found had been reported previously: https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergangwheres-your-ir-team/72283/\n\nWhile traces of Android mobile malware have been spotted, attackers have continuously used the Downeks downloader and the Quasar or\nCobaltstrike RATs to target Windows devices, enabling them to obtain remote access spying and data exfiltration abilities. This is now\nachieved more efficiently using the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability which enables direct code execution abilities from a Microsoft office document\non non-patched victim Windows systems. The use of Microsoft Access database files has also enabled the attackers to maintain low levels of\ndetection, as it’s not an uncommon method to deliver malware.\n\nThese developments have helped the attackers continue their operations, targeting a variety of victims and organizations, sometimes even\nbypassing defences and persisting for prolonged periods.\n\n### 4.1. The extended use of humanitarian and political causes in social engineering attacks\n\nAttackers have continuously targeted victims and organizations in government entities/embassies, oil and gas, media/press, activists,\npoliticians, and diplomats.\n\nThe Gaza cybergang relies increasingly on advanced and up-to-date social engineering techniques with political and humanitarian aspects that\ndirectly reflect regional incidents. Here is a short list of incidents that were each used multiple times:\n\nPalestinian Government not paying salaries to Gaza employees\nPalestinian prisoners’ hunger strike in Israeli jails\nThe political crisis in Qatar\n\nRecent targets for the group seem to be varied in nature, the attackers do not appear to be choosing targets selectively, but rather seeking any\ntype of intelligence.\n\n**4.1.1.

The use of Microsoft Access files with macros\n\nMicrosoft Access files with macro is another new development by the attacker group. MS Access database-embedded macros are proving to\nhave very low detection rates.\n\nMD5: 6d6f34f7cfcb64e44d67638a2f33d619\n\nFilename: GAZA2017.mdb\n\nC1: http://download.data-server.cloudns[.]club/GAZA2017.mdb\n\n**Downloads and executes:**\n\ndata-server.cloudns[.]club/wordindexer.exe\ndata-server.cloudns[.]club/indexer.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nTranslation: database of employees not receiving salaries, click “enable content” to see data\n\nDecrypted code\n\n### 4.3. Exploitation of the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability\n\nMD5: 87a67371770fda4c2650564cbb00934d\n\nFirst seen: 20-06-2017\n\nFilenames:\n\ndoc\n???? ????? ???? ????? ??? ????????.doc (Translation: the points of agreement between Hamas and the reforment Fateh movement)\n???? ?????? ?????? ??? ??????.doc (Translation: minutes of the tonight Fateh meeting)\n???? ?? ???? ???????? ??? ???????? ???????.doc (Translation: An advance on salary or full salary for employees next Tuesday?)\n\nThe attacks are a typical exploitation of CVE-2017-0199, starting with an email that distributes a malicious RTF document. The vulnerability is\nin the code that handles Ole2Link embedded objects, which allows Microsoft Office Word to run remote files, downloaded in this case from\n138.68.242[.]68. The downloaded payload is Cobaltstrike, which then connects to lol.mynetav[.]org to receive commands from the attackers.\nAdditional details on the Gaza cybergang’s use of CVE 2017-0199 with Cobaltstrike, can be found here:\n[http://bobao.360.cn/learning/detail/4193.html](http://bobao.360.cn/learning/detail/4193.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n### oss b e d o d ob e a a e\n\nTraces of APK files have been seen on one of the attackers’ command centers, starting from 23-04-2017.\n\nURL: http://alasra-paper.duckdns[.]org/send/%D9%88%ket-Edition-1.04_ApkHouse[.]com/Dont-Starve-Pocket-Edition1.04_ApkHouse[.]com.apk\n\nThe file name (Dont-Starve-Pocket-Edition-1.04_ApkHouse[.]com.apk), is an Android application file hiding as a popular game. We believe the\nandroid Trojan could be related to a previously investigated Android Trojan around the Gaza strip: https://securelist.com/breaking-the-weakestlink-of-the-strongest-chain/77562/\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nThe Gaza Cybergang has demonstrated a large number of attacks and advanced social engineering, in addition to active development of\nattacks, infrastructure and the utilization of new methods and techniques. Attackers are actively improving their toolkit in an effort to minimize\ntheir exposure to security products and services. Kaspersky Lab expects these types of attacks to intensify in the near term, both in terms of\nquality and quantity.\n\nIn order to protect your company from malware, Kaspersky Lab researchers recommend implementing the following measures:\n\nEducate staff to be able to distinguish spear-phishing emails or a phishing link from legitimate emails and links\nUse proven corporate grade security solution in combination with anti-targeted attacks solutions capable of catching attacks by analyzing\nnetwork anomalies\nProvide security staff with access to the latest threat intelligence data, which will arm them with helpful tools for targeted attacks\nprevention and discovery, such as indicators of compromise and YARA rules\nMake sure enterprise grade patch management processes are well established and executed.\n\nMore information about Gaza cybergang is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting Service.
