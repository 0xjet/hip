The](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/08080817/EB-YetiJuly2014-Public.pdf)_\n_group tends to attack different companies with a strong focus on the energy and industrial_\n_sectors. Companies attacked by Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti are geographically_\n_distributed worldwide with a more obvious concentration in Europe and the US. In 2016-_\n_2017, the number of attacks on companies in Turkey increased significantly._\n\n_The main tactics of the group include sending phishing emails with malicious documents and_\n_infecting various servers. The group uses some of the infected servers for auxiliary purposes_\n_– to host tools and logs. Others are deliberately infected to use them in waterhole attacks in_\n_order to reach the group’s main targets._\n\n_[Recent activity of the group against US organizations was discussed in a US-CERT advisory,](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)_\n_which linked the actor to the Russian government, as well as an advisory by the UK National_\n_Cyber Security Centre._\n\n\n-----\n\n_This report by_ _[Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT presents information on identified servers that have](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/)_\n_been infected and used by the group. The report also includes the findings of an analysis of_\n_several webservers compromised by the Energetic Bear group during 2016 and in early_\n_2017._\n\n## Attack victims\n\nThe table below shows the distribution of compromised servers (based on the language of\nwebsite content and/or the origins of the company renting the server at the time of\ncompromise) by countries, attacked company types and the role of each server in the overall\nattack scheme. Victims of the threat actor’s attacks were not limited to industrial companies.\n\n**Table 1. Compromised servers**\n\n**Country** **Description** **Role in the attack**\n\n**Russia** Opposition political website Waterhole\n\nReal estate agency Auxiliary (collecting user data\nin the waterhole attack)\n\nFootball club Waterhole\n\n\nDeveloper and integrator of\nsecure automation systems and\nIS consultant\n\nDevelopers of software and\nequipment\n\n\nWaterhole\n\nAuxiliary (collecting user data\nin the waterhole attack, tool\nhosting)\n\n\nInvestment website Auxiliary (collecting user data\nin the waterhole attack)\n\n**Ukraine** Electric power sector\ncompany\n\nBank Waterhole\n\n\nWaterhole\n\n\n**UK** Aerospace company Waterhole\n\n\n**Germany** Software developer and\nintegrator\n\nUnknown Auxiliary (collecting user data\nin the waterhole attack)\n\n\nWaterhole\n\n\n**Turkey** Oil and gas sector enterprise Waterhole\n\nIndustrial group Waterhole\n\n\n-----\n\nInvestment group Waterhole\n\n**Greece** Server of a university Auxiliary (collecting\nuser data in the\nwaterhole attack)\n\n**USA** Oil and gas sector enterprise Waterhole\n\n**Unknown** Affiliate network site Auxiliary (collecting\nuser data in the\nwaterhole attack)\n\n## Waterhole\n\nAll waterhole servers are infected following the same pattern: injecting a link into a web page\nor JS file with the following file scheme: file://IP/filename.png.\n\nThe link is used to initiate a request for an image, as a result of which the user connects to\nthe remote server over the SMB protocol. In this attack type, the attackers’ goal is to extract\nthe following data from the session:\n\nuser IP,\nuser name,\ndomain name,\nNTLM hash of the user’s password.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt should be noted that the image requested using the link is not physically located on the\nremote server.\n\n## Scanned resources\n\nCompromised servers are in some cases used to conduct attacks on other resources. In the\nprocess of analyzing infected servers, numerous websites and servers were identified that\nthe attackers had scanned with various tools, such as nmap, dirsearch, sqlmap, etc. (tool\ndescriptions are provided below).\n\n**Table 2. Resources that were scanned from one of the infected servers**\n\n\n**Country**\n\n**(based on the content)**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n**Russia** Non-profit\norganization\n\nSale of drugs\n\nTravel/maps\n\nResources based on the Bump platform (platform for corporate social\nnetworks) – non-profit organization, social network for college/university\nalumni, communication platform for NGOs, etc.\n\nBusiness – photographic studio\n\nIndustrial enterprise, construction company\n\nDoor manufacturing\n\nCryptocurrency exchange\n\nConstruction information and analysis portal\n\nPersonal website of a developer\n\nVainah Telecom IPs and Subnets (Chechen Republic)\n\nVarious Chechen resources (governmental organizations, universities,\nindustrial enterprises, etc.)\n\nWeb server with numerous sites (alumni sites, sites of industrial and\nengineering companies, etc.)\n\nMuslim dating site\n\n**Brazil** Water\ntreatment\n\n\n-----\n\n**Turkey** Hotels\n\nEmbassy in Turkey\n\nSoftware developer\n\nAirport website\n\nCity council website\n\nCosmetics manufacturer\n\nReligious website\n\nTurktelekom subnet with a large number of sites\n\nTelnet Telecom subnet with a large number of sites\n\n**Georgia** Personal\nwebsite of a\njournalist\n\n**Kazakhstan** Unknown\nweb server\n\n**Ukraine** Office\nsupplies\nonline store\n\nFloral business\n\nImage hosting service\n\nOnline course on sales\n\nDealer of farming equipment and spare parts\n\nUkrainian civil servant’s personal website\n\nOnline store of parts for household appliance repair\n\nTimber sales, construction\n\nTennis club website\n\nOnline store for farmers\n\nOnline store of massage equipment\n\nOnline clothes store\n\nWebsite development and promotion\n\n\n-----\n\nOnline air conditioner store\n\n**Switzerland** Analytical\ncompany\n\n**US** Web server\nwith many\ndomains\n\n**France** Web server\nwith many\ndomains\n\n**Vietnam** Unknown\nserver\n\n**International** Flight\ntracker\n\nThe sites and servers on this list do not seem to have anything in common. Even though the\nscanned servers do not necessarily look like potential final victims, it is likely that the\nattackers scanned different resources to find a server that could be used to establish a\nfoothold for hosting the attackers’ tools and, subsequently, to develop the attack.\n\nPart of the sites scanned may have been of interest to the attackers as candidates for\nhosting waterhole resources.\n\nIn some cases, the domains scanned were hosted on the same server; sometimes the\nattackers went through the list of possible domains matching a given IP.\n\nIn most cases, multiple attempts to compromise a specific target were not identified – with\nthe possible exception of sites on the Bump platform, flight tracker servers and servers of a\nTurkish hotel chain.\n\nCuriously, the sites scanned included a web developer’s website, kashey.ru, and resources\nlinks to which were found on this site. These may have been links to resources developed by\nthe site’s owner: www.esodedi.ru, www.i-stroy.ru, www.saledoor.ru\n\n## Toolset used\n\n### Utilities\n\nUtilities found on compromised servers are open-source and publicly available on GitHub:\n\nNmap – an open-source utility for analyzing the network and verifying its security.\n[Dirsearch — a simple command-line tool for brute forcing (performing exhaustive](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch)\nsearches of) directories and files on websites.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Sqlmap — an open-source penetration testing tool, which automates the process of](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap)\nidentifying and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities and taking over database\nservers.\n[Sublist3r — a tool written in Python designed to enumerate website subdomains. The](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r)\n[tool uses open-source intelligence (OSINT). Sublist3r supports many different search](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSINT)\nengines, such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu and Ask, as well as such services as\nNetcraft, Virustotal, ThreatCrowd, DNSdumpster and ReverseDNS. The tool helps\npenetration testers to collect information on the subdomains of the domain they are\nresearching.\n[Wpscan — a WordPress vulnerability scanner that uses the blackbox principle, i.e.,](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan)\nworks without access to the source code. It can be used to scan remote WordPress\nsites in search of security issues.\n[Impacket — a toolset for working with various network protocols, which is required by](https://github.com/CoreSecurity/impacket)\nSMBTrap.\n[SMBTrap — a tool for logging data received over the SMB protocol (user IP address,](https://github.com/CylanceSPEAR/SMBTrap)\nuser name, domain name, password NTLM hash).\n[Commix — a vulnerability search and command injection and exploitation tool written in](https://github.com/commixproject/commix)\nPython.\n[Subbrute – a subdomain enumeration tool available for Python and Windows that uses](https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute)\nan open name resolver as a proxy and does not send traffic to the target DNS server.\n[PHPMailer – a mail sending tool.](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer)\n\nIn addition, a custom Python script named ftpChecker.py was found on one of the servers.\nThe script was designed to check FTP hosts from an incoming list.\n\n### Malicious php files\n\nThe following malicious php files were found in different directories in the nginx folder and in\na working directory created by the attackers on an infected web servers:\n\n\n**File name** **Brief**\n**description**\n\nini.php wso shell+\nmail\n\nmysql.php wso shell+\nmail\n\n\n**md5sum** **Time of**\n**the**\n**latest**\n**file**\n**change**\n**(MSK)**\n\nf3e3e25a822012023c6e81b206711865 201607-01\n15:57:38\n\nf3e3e25a822012023c6e81b206711865 201606-12\n13:35:30\n\n\n**Size,**\n**bytes**\n\n28786\n\n28786\n\n\n-----\n\nopts.php wso shell c76470e85b7f3da46539b40e5c552712 201606-12\n12:23:28\n\nerror_log.php wso shell 155385cc19e3092765bcfed034b82ccb 201606-12\n10:59:39\n\ncode29.php web shell 1644af9b6424e8f58f39c7fa5e76de51 201606-12\n11:10:40\n\nproxy87.php web shell 1644af9b6424e8f58f39c7fa5e76de51 201606-12\n14:31:13\n\ntheme.php wso shell 2292f5db385068e161ae277531b2e114 201705-16\n17:33:02\n\nsma.php PHPMailer 7ec514bbdc6dd8f606f803d39af8883f 201705-19\n13:53:53\n\nmedia.php wso shell 78c31eff38fdb72ea3b1800ea917940f 201704-17\n15:58:41\n\nIn the table above:\n\n\n36623\n\n36636\n\n10724\n\n10724\n\n133104\n\n14696\n\n1762986\n\n\nWeb shell is a script that allows remote administration of the machine.\nWSO is a popular web shell and file manager (it stands for “Web Shell by Orb”) that\nhas the ability to masquerade as an error page containing a hidden login form. It is\navailable on GitHub:\n\n[https://github.com/phpFileManager/WSO](https://github.com/phpFileManager/WSO)\n\nTwo of the PHP scripts found, ini.php and mysql.php, contained a WSO shell concatenated\nwith the following email spamming script:\n\n[https://github.com/bediger4000/php-malware-analysis/tree/master/db-config.php](https://github.com/bediger4000/php-malware-analysis/tree/master/db-config.php)\n\nAll the scripts found are obfuscated.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nOne of the web shells was found on the server under two different names (proxy87.php and\ncode29.php). It uses the eval function to execute a command sent via HTTP cookies or a\nPOST request:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### Modified sshd\n\nA modified sshd with a preinstalled backdoor was found in the process of analyzing the\nserver.\n\nPatches with some versions of backdoors for sshd that are similar to the backdoor found are\navailable on GitHub, for example:\n\n[https://github.com/jivoi/openssh-backdoor-kit](https://github.com/jivoi/openssh-backdoor-kit)\n\nCompilation is possible on any OS with binary compatibility.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs a result of replacing the original sshd file with a modified one on the infected server, an\nattacker can use a ‘master password’ to get authorized on the remote server, while leaving\nminimal traces (compared to an ordinary user connecting via ssh).\n\nIn addition, the modified sshd logs all legitimate ssh connections (this does not apply to the\nconnection that uses the ‘master password’), including connection times, account names and\npasswords. The log is encrypted and is located at /var/tmp/.pipe.sock.\n\n## Activity of the attackers on compromised servers\n\nIn addition to using compromised servers to scan numerous resources, other attacker activity\nwas also identified.\n\nAfter gaining access to the server, the attackers installed the tools they needed at different\ntimes. Specifically, the following commands for third-party installations were identified on one\nof the servers:\n\napt install traceroute\napt-get install nmap\napt-get install screen\ngit clone https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git\n\nAdditionally, the attackers installed any packages and tools for Python they needed.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe diagram below shows times of illegitimate logons to one of the compromised servers\nduring one month. The attackers checked the smbtrap log file on working days. In most\ncases, they logged on to the server at roughly the same time of day, probably in the morning\nhours:\n\nIn addition, in the process of performing the analysis, an active process was identified that\nexploited SQL injection and collected data from a database of one of the victims.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe findings of the analysis of compromised servers and the attackers’ activity on these\nservers are as follows:\n\n1. With rare exceptions, the group’s members get by with publicly available tools. The use\n\nof publicly available utilities by the group to conduct its attacks renders the task of\nattack attribution without any additional group ‘markers’ very difficult.\n2. Potentially, any vulnerable server on the internet is of interest to the attackers when\n\nthey want to establish a foothold in order to develop further attacks against target\nfacilities.\n3. In most cases that we have observed, the group performed tasks related to searching\n\nfor vulnerabilities, gaining persistence on various hosts, and stealing authentication\ndata.\n4. The diversity of victims may indicate the diversity of the attackers’ interests.\n\n\n-----\n\n5. It can be assumed with some degree of certainty that the group operates in the\n\ninterests of or takes orders from customers that are external to it, performing initial data\ncollection, the theft of authentication data and gaining persistence on resources that\nare suitable for the attack’s further development.\n\n## Appendix I – Indicators of Compromise\n\n### Filenames and Paths\n\n**Tools***\n\n/usr/lib/libng/ftpChecker.py\n\n/usr/bin/nmap/\n\n/usr/lib/libng/dirsearch/\n\n/usr/share/python2.7/dirsearch/\n\n/usr/lib/libng/SMBTrap/\n\n/usr/lib/libng/commix/\n\n/usr/lib/libng/subbrute-master/\n\n/usr/share/python2.7/sqlmap/\n\n/usr/lib/libng/sqlmap-dev/\n\n/usr/lib/libng/wpscan/\n\n/usr/share/python2.7/wpscan/\n\n/usr/share/python2.7/Sublist3r/\n\n*Note that these tools can also be used by other threat actors.\n\n**PHP files:**\n\n/usr/share/python2.7/sma.php\n\n/usr/share/python2.7/theme.php\n\n/root/theme.php\n\n/usr/lib/libng/media.php\n\n**Logs**\n\n/var/tmp/.pipe.sock\n\n### PHP file hashes\n\nf3e3e25a822012023c6e81b206711865\n\nc76470e85b7f3da46539b40e5c552712\n\n155385cc19e3092765bcfed034b82ccb\n\n1644af9b6424e8f58f39c7fa5e76de51\n\n\n-----\n\n2292f5db385068e161ae277531b2e114\n7ec514bbdc6dd8f606f803d39af8883f\n78c31eff38fdb72ea3b1800ea917940f\n\n### Yara rules\n\nrule Backdoored_ssh {\n\nstrings:\n\n$a1 = “OpenSSH”\n\n$a2 = “usage: ssh”\n\n$a3 = “HISTFILE”\n\ncondition:\n\nuint32(0) == 0x464c457f and filesize<1000000 and all of ($a*)\n\n}\n\n## Appendix II – Shell script to check a server for tools\n\n### Shell script for Debian\n\ncd /tmp\n\nworkdir=428c5fcf495396df04a459e317b70ca2\n\nmkdir $workdir\n\ncd $workdir\n\nfind / -type d -iname smbtrap > find-smbtrap.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname dirsearch > find-dirsearch.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname nmap > find-nmap.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname wpscan > find-wpscan.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname sublist3r > find-sublist3r.txt 2>/dev/null\n\ndpkg -l | grep -E \\(impacket\\|pcapy\\|nmap\\) > dpkg-grep.txt\n\ncp /var/lib/dpkg/info/openssh-server.md5sums . #retrieve initial hash for sshd\n\nmd5sum /usr/sbin/sshd > sshd.md5sum #calculate actual hash for sshd\n\n### Shell script for Centos\n\ncd /tmp\n\nworkdir=428c5fcf495396df04a459e317b70ca2\n\nmkdir $workdir\n\ncd $workdir\n\nfind / -type d -iname smbtrap > find-smbtrap.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname dirsearch > find-dirsearch.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname nmap > find-nmap.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname wpscan > find-wpscan.txt 2>/dev/null\n\nfind / -type d -iname sublist3r > find-sublist3r.txt 2>/dev/null\n\n\n-----\n\nrpm -qa | grep -E \\(impacket\\|pcapy\\|nmap\\) > rpm-grep.txt\nrpm -qa –dump | grep ssh > rpm-qa-dump.txt #retrieve initial hash for sshd\nsha256sum /usr/sbin/sshd > sshd.sha256sum #calculate actual sha256 hash for sshd\nmd5sum /usr/sbin/sshd > sshd.md5sum #calculate actual md5 hash for sshd\n\n**[Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti: attacks on servers](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/media/EB_public_FINAL_EN_20042018.pdf)**\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Backdoor](https://securelist.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Vulnerabilities and exploits](https://securelist.com/tag/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/)\n[Watering hole attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/watering-hole-attacks/)\n\nAuthors\n\n[Kaspersky ICS CERT](https://securelist.com/author/icscert/)\n\nEnergetic Bear/Crouching Yeti: attacks on servers\n\nYour email address will not be published.
