Such static methods fall short in\ndetecting unknown types of malware-generated network traffic, which calls for more advanced\ndetection techniques that incorporate inspection of the overall packet structure, rather than specific\nstatic patterns.\n\nIn a blog on [data leakage from Android apps, Unit 42 researchers demonstrated that unknown traffic](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/android-apps-data-leakage/)\ntypes that leak sensitive user information could be detected using machine learning techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on command and control (C2) traffic from malware, such as Sality and Emotet, this blog\nanalyzes how deep learning models are further able to identify modified and incomplete C2 traffic\npackets. This analysis illustrates that the usage of machine learning techniques in IPS can discover\nyet unseen variants of C2 traffic and can help detect advanced attack campaigns.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall customers are protected from such types of attacks by](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall)\nIPS and AppID in our [Threat Prevention security subscription and with malware analysis and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/threat-prevention)\n[prevention through our WildFire security subscription.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire)\n\n## C2 Attacks\n\nOne of the most damaging aspects of malicious network attacks is accomplished through C2. After\nmalware infects a computer, it establishes a connection to the attacker's server -- the so-called C2\nserver -- to perform additional tasks that may include downloading other malicious software, data\ntheft or establishing remote control.\n\nIn the following sections, we introduce several malicious C2 traffic types, which we use as samples\nto show how an advanced machine learning system can detect such traffic. The discussed malware\nserves as examples to illustrate the effectiveness of our machine learning AI in the detection of C2\ntraffic. The detection capabilities of our AI are not limited to the presented malware samples, but can\nbe applied to general C2 detection.\n\n### Sality\n\nThe Sality malware was first discovered in 2003 and became more advanced over the years due to\nthe continuous development of new features and capabilities. Sality spreads itself by infecting and\nmodifying executable files and copying itself to removable drives and shared folders.\n\nOnce the malware infects a computer system, it attempts to open connections to remote sites,\ndownload additional malicious files and leak data from the host machine. Although Sality has been\naround for a while, the continued development and addition of new features make it an effective and\ncomplex malware.\n\nThe following two HTTP packet headers (Figures 1 and 2) show C2 traffic used by Sality to connect\nto the remote site padrup[.]com.\n\nGET /sobaka1.gif?12db3cf=98861835 HTTP/1.1\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0b; Windows NT 6.0)\n\nHost: padrup[.]com\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nCookie: jsessionid=85b50d8fab658ecb9f79aa4de6039c87\n\n_Figure 1.

Sality C2 traffic._\n\nC2 traffic from Sality, such as the packets shown in Figures 1 and 2, communicates with various C2\nservers worldwide to perform tasks such as downloading and installing additional malware or\nleaking sensitive data.\n\n### Emotet\n\nEmotet malware has been known since 2014 as banking malware. Typically, Emotet is distributed\nwith Microsoft Word documents containing embedded macros to infect vulnerable hosts. C2 traffic\nfrom Emotet malware transmits encoded or otherwise encrypted data over the HTTP protocol. In\nFigures 3 and 4, we show HTTP packet headers from Emotet C2 traffic.\n\nPOST /r1s4dvgwanu1ov8qku/e6qj08nos8kh/o7rhpr2xi05tkkp/ HTTP/1.1\n\nDNT: 0\n\nReferer: 90.[]160[.]138[.]175/r1s4dvgwanu1ov8qku/e6qj08nos8kh/o7rhpr2xi05tkkp/\n\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------1BetPUScZnIzXogZ6qQcQ8\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2;\n.NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3[.]0[.]30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET\nCLR 1.1.4322; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; InfoPath.3)\n\nHost: 90[.]160[.]138[.]175\n\nContent-Length: 5556\n\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n_Figure 3.

Emotet C2 traffic._\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther details about Emotet s C2 traffic and how to analyze it can be found in Unit 42 s posts,\n[Wireshark Tutorial: Examining Emotet Infection Traffic and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wireshark-tutorial-emotet-infection/) Attack Chain Overview: Emotet in\nDecember 2020 and January 2021.\n\n## Detecting C2 Traffic\n\nThe goal of an IPS is to accurately identify connections to a C2 server. Due to the dynamic nature of\nthe internet and the fast-changing assignment of IP addresses and domain names, this is very\nchallenging to achieve, and defenders often lag behind attackers.\n\nAn approach typically used in today’s security industry is to identify C2 traffic, such as network\npackets from Emotet, as shown above, with static signatures that match a specific pattern in the\ntraffic. This approach has the advantage of being accurate, but it is not flexible in detecting\nvariations or unknown types of traffic. Detecting packets (shown in Figure 3) are especially\nproblematic since there are no reliable patterns in the packet that could be used in a signature. For\nexample, the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) path from an Emotet packet (shown below) appears\nto contain random strings, which might transmit encoded information, but would not be a reliable\npattern to be used in a signature:\n\nPOST /r1s4dvgwanu1ov8qku/e6qj08nos8kh/o7rhpr2xi05tkkp/ HTTP/1.1\n\nA similar case can be observed in the user-agent field, which shows generic values from a web\nbrowser, as well as the hostname, which consists of a specific IP address:\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2;\n.NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET CLR\n1.1.4322; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; InfoPath.3)\n\nHost: 90[.]160[.]138[.]175\n\nNeither fields represent ideal candidates for signature generation.\n\nOther types of C2 packets can be reliably identified with traffic patterns. Such reliable patterns are\ntypically character strings that uniquely identify a certain type of C2 traffic and are not found in other\n(i.e. benign) traffic sessions. Still, this approach has the same disadvantage as IP/domain namebased detection due to the inherent challenges of maintaining an up-to-date and complete set of\ntraffic patterns.\n\nDue to these shortcomings, the application of machine learning is imperative to achieve flexible and\nreliable detection of C2 traffic. This is critical for detecting novel types of network-based attacks.\n\n### C2 Detection with Deep Learning\n\nIt is crucial to detect these malicious C2 traffic sessions promptly. As mentioned above, this is\ntraditionally done through the usage of static signatures on payloads and URLs. However, these\nsignatures are not exhaustive and can not detect novel C2 sessions. For these reasons, we\nresearched a deep learning model that can automatically extract the important features from a vast\namount of data to detect malicious C2 sessions.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur deep learning model leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to learn the content and\ncontext from a network session and determine if it connects to a malicious C2 server. Our detection\nmodule determines the probability of the session being malicious. Based on the predetermined\nthreshold, we can classify if a given session is malicious or not. For this blog, we tested a model\ntrained on ~60 million HTTP session headers with ~36 million benign and ~24 million malicious\nsessions. This dataset was collected in 2019.\n\nThe hyperparameters for training the deep learning model are computed so the false positive rate of\nthe model remains below 0.025%. We tested this model for over four months and observed that the\naverage false positive rate remained below 0.02% with more than 98% precision.\n\n### How Does a Deep Learning Model Detect the Traffic Packets Shown Above?\n\nDeep learning models extract features implicitly from the training data. Thus, it may not be possible\nto ascertain precisely which feature or sequence of features from a packet header triggers\ndetection.\n\nDeep neural networks have many parameters to obtain a highly expressive data representation\ncompared to traditional statistical models. By presenting a deep learning model with millions of\nknown malicious data packets, a neural network is trained to recognize the general structure of a C2\ntraffic packet. Consequently, the factors involved in packet classification do not depend on a single\nfield (such as the host name), but on various features -- the combination of characters and words or\nthe structure of the packet. The features that distinguish a benign packet from a malicious one are\nautomatically recognized by the neural network during the training process of millions of labeled\ndata points.\n\nTo better understand how a detection decision is made, we re-create the packet headers by\nremoving some critical information (e.g., hostname, URI paths) and evaluate these re-created\nheaders with our deep learning model. We summarized our results for different types of malicious\nC2 traffic in Table 1 and Table 2.\n\nIn Table 1, we present the probability with which our model could detect a session as malicious by\ntesting the full HTTP header, as well as the header without the uri-path, hostname, user-agent or\nreferer. These context-fields were removed one at a time. We observed that the model could detect\nall four C2 sessions with high confidence when all header field information was present. We also\nsee that the model was not reliant on one specific context-field and could detect malicious C2\ndetection without some of them present.\n\n\n**Malware C2** **Full**\n**header**\n\n\n**Without uri-**\n**path**\n\n\n**Without**\n**hostname**\n\n\n**Without user-**\n**agent**\n\n\n**Without**\n**referer**\n\n\nEmotet C2\ntraffic 1\n\nEmotet C2\ntraffic 2\n\nSality C2 traffic\n1\n\n\n99.72 99.86 96.28 97.37 99.55\n\n99.79 99.91 98.04 95.48 99.76\n\n99.99 99.99 99.98 99.99 NA\n\n\n-----\n\nSality C2 traffic\n2\n\n\n99.99 99.99 99.98 99.99 NA\n\n\n_Table 1. Performance of our deep learning model on session headers with different levels of_\n_information (the values in the table show the model confidence of a session being malicious; NA =_\n_the packet didn’t have this field)._\n\nAs we discussed above, a significant challenge in detecting C2 traffic with static signatures is\ndifferentiating reliable patterns from the network traffic. But, this is not the only pitfall signatures face\nin the detection of C2 traffic. A slight modification of C2 malware traffic could render a signature\nineffective. Consider the Sality C2 packet shown in Figure 1. The pattern ‘GET /sobaka1.gif’ is a\npotential candidate to be used in a signature in an IPS. An advanced malware may frequently\nchange the command pattern in its traffic payload to bypass packet inspection by an IPS.\n\nWe simulate such behavior by modifying packet headers and analyze how the detection output of\nour deep learning model changes. Consider the example below. We changed the uri-path in the\nSality C2 packet shown in Figure 1 from ‘sobaka1.gif?12db3cf=98861835’ to ‘/nobata2.gif?\n52ad3pf=77952613’ and our model was still able to detect the packet header as malicious with\n99.9% confidence. The full modified packet header is shown in Figure 5.\n\nGET /nobata2.gif?52ad3pf=77952613 HTTP/1.1\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0b; Windows NT 6.0)\n\nHost: padrup[.]com\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nCookie: jsessionid=85b50d8fab658ecb9f79aa4de6039c87\n\n_Figure 5. Modified packet header of Sality C2 traffic._\n\nIn Table 2, we present the prediction results of our model on changing values of different context\nfields, one at a time, in the request header. We observed that our model could detect the C2\nsessions with modified values in the context-fields. This shows that our deep learning model is not\nrelying on one specific context-field value, but is learning from the overall structure of the request\nheader.\n\n\n**Malware C2** **Full**\n**header**\n\n\n**Modified**\n**uripath**\n\n\n**Modified**\n**host**\n\n\n**Modified user-**\n**agent**\n\n\n**Modified**\n**referer**\n\n\nEmotet C2\ntraffic 1\n\nEmotet C2\ntraffic 2\n\nSality C2 traffic\n1\n\nSality C2 traffic\n2\n\n\n99.72 99.72 98.60 98.86 99.63\n\n99.79 99.92 99.94 99.99 99.94\n\n99.99 99.99 99.96 99.95 NA\n\n99.99 99.99 99.85 99.97 NA\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 2. Performance of our deep learning model on session headers with changes made on_\n_different context-fields of a request header (the values in the table shows the model confidence of a_\n_session being malicious; NA = the packet didn’t have this field)._\n\nIn addition to specific payload patterns in packet headers, the ordering of fields can play a role in\ndetecting C2 sessions with deep learning. In Table 3, we show how our model performs when the\npackets arrive in different context-field structures. For evaluation, we organized the context fields -host name (H), referer (R) for Emotet cache-control (C) for Sality and user-agent (UA) in different\narrangements. We found that our deep learning model could identify the payloads correctly even\nwhen the packet structure was changed.\n\n**Malware C2** **Full header** **(UP|H|R/C|UA)** **(UP|H|UA|R/C)** **(UP|UA|H|R/C)**\n\nEmotet C2 traffic 1 99.72 99.65 98.84 99.50\n\nEmotet C2 traffic 2 99.79 98.27 99.51 99.74\n\nSality C2 traffic 1 99.99 99.90 99.99 99.99\n\nSality C2 traffic 2 99.99 99.93 99.98 99.98\n\n_Table 3. Performance of our deep learning model on session headers with reordered context-fields_\n_(H = Host name, UA = User-Agent, UP = Uri-Path, R = Referer/C=Cache-Control) (the values in the_\n_table shows the model confidence of a session being malicious; NA = the packet didn’t have this_\n_field)._\n\nOverall, the results presented above demonstrate the strength of our deep learning model on\ndetecting the malicious C2 sessions of the malware families like Emotet and Sality. These malware\nfamilies might connect to different host servers and transfer additional information to conduct\nattacks, making it challenging to capture them with static signatures.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur research on using deep learning for C2 traffic detection shows the potential and necessity to\nuse advanced machine learning for intrusion detection and prevention. For novel attacks and zeroday vulnerabilities, it is critical to rely on systems that can identify attacks based on known traffic\nfeatures and identify unknown types of malicious network traffic to detect and prevent advanced\nthreat campaigns at an early stage. The results Unit 42 sees in various research projects directly\ncontribute to Threat Prevention and WildFire security subscriptions to ensure the protection of our\nNext-Generation Firewall customers.\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n\n-----",
