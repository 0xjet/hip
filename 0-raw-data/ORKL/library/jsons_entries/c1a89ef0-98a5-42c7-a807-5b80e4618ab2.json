Thus, in a time of war in Ukraine, the spotlight has also naturally turned to\ncyberwarfare, both past and present.\n\nSince at least 2014, companies in Ukraine or with network access to the region have\nsuffered the likes of malware such as BlackEnergy, GreyEnergy, Industroyer, NotPetya,\n[Exaramel, and, in 2022 alone, WhisperGate,](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/) [HermeticWiper,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/02/24/hermeticwiper-new-data-wiping-malware-hits-ukraine/) [IsaacWiper, and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/) [CaddyWiper.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/15/caddywiper-new-wiper-malware-discovered-ukraine/)\nIn all cases, except the last four, the cybersecurity community discovered enough code\nsimilarities, shared command and control infrastructure, malware execution chains and\nother hints to attribute all the malware samples to one overarching group – Sandworm.\n\n## Who is Sandworm?\n\nThe moniker Sandworm was chosen by researchers at iSIGHT Partners, a threat\nintelligence company, who discovered references to Frank Herbert’s novel Dune in\nBlackEnergy malware binaries in 2014. At that time, ESET researchers were presenting\ntheir findings on several targeted BlackEnergy attacks in Ukraine and Poland at a Virus\nBulletin conference, but also discovered the same, unmistakable references in the code:\narrakis02, houseatreides94, BasharoftheSardaukars, SalusaSecundus2, and\nepsiloneridani0.\n\nWhile some speculated that Sandworm was a group working from Russia, it wasn’t until\n[2020 that the US Department of Justice (DoJ) concretely identified Sandworm as Military](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328521/download)\nUnit 74455 of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) – which was changed to the Main\nDirectorate (GU) in 2010, although “GRU” seems to have stuck in Western parlance – of the\nGeneral Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, located at 22 Kirova Street,\nKhimki, Moscow in a building colloquially called “the Tower”:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. The Tower on 22 Kirova Street identified by the US DoJ as the location of GRU Unit_\n\n_[74455 (image source)](https://www.google.com/maps/@55.8829321,37.4575142,3a,35.8y,316.46h,98.32t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1stJbsChZ5HQ4ZFHyeE4kSYg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192)_\n\nIn his [tome on Sandworm, Andy Greenberg reflected on his walk along the Moscow Canal](https://www.amazon.com/Sandworm-Cyberwar-Kremlins-Dangerous-Hackers-ebook/dp/B07GD4MFW2)\nbelow: “With my back to the canal, the Tower stood directly above me, blocked off by a high\niron fence on a steep hill. I couldn’t make out a single human figure through its windows\nwithout using a pair of binoculars, which I wasn’t brave enough to try. It struck me that this\nwas as close as I was likely ever going to get to the hackers I’d now been following for two\nyears.”\n\nThe [2020 DoJ indictment that pulled the veil on Sandworm also named six officers of Unit](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328541/download)\n74455: Yuriy Sergeyevich Andrienko, Sergey Vladimirovich Detistov, Pavel Valeryevich\nFrolov, Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev, Artem Valeryevich Ochichenko, and Petr\nNikolayevich Pliskin.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 2. ‘Wanted’ poster for six members of GRU Unit 74455 (image source: FBI)](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/gru-hackers-destructive-malware-and-international-cyber-attacks)_\n\nA [2018 indictment of the DoJ had named three additional officers of Unit 74455, Aleksandr](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download)\nVladimirovich Osadchuk, Aleksey Aleksandrovich Potemkin, and Anatoliy Sergeyevich\nKovalev.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs it is unlikely that these officers will ever be brought before a US court, it also appears\nunlikely for now to see what evidence the prosecutors might have to back the indictment.\nPublicly, this leaves the attribution of certain malicious campaigns to Sandworm based on\nthese indictments alone on a more precarious footing. Yet where the two indictments\nincorporate information from public technical analyses of the malware attributed to\nSandworm’s subgroups, like BlackEnergy, TeleBots, and GreyEnergy, the attribution rests\non much more solid ground.\n\n## Sandworm pummeling organizations far and wide\n\nThe sheer number of malicious campaigns and malware that have been linked to\nSandworm over the years forms a litany of attacks that is difficult to summarize briefly.\nHowever, running through this list can give at least a broad perspective on the sophisticated\ncapability demonstrated by this threat group.\n\n### BlackEnergy: From DDoS attacks to industrial control systems (2007–2015)\n\nThe first inklings of BlackEnergy’s existence came in 2007 when Arbor Networks\n[researchers identified a new botnet used by Russian hackers to conduct distributed denial-](https://web.archive.org/web/20140329075643/http:/atlas-public.ec2.arbor.net/docs/BlackEnergy+DDoS+Bot+Analysis.pdf)\nof-service attacks (DDoS) against Russian targets. BlackEnergy was sold by its original\n[developer and used to strike Georgian websites with DDoS attacks when Russian troops hit](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Asia_2008_Steven.pdf)\nthe ground in Georgia in 2008.\n\n[In 2010, Dell SecureWorks released an analysis of a complete rewrite of the malware –](https://www.secureworks.com/research/blackenergy2)\nBlackEnergy 2 – with new capabilities to hide as a rootkit, send spam, steal banking\ncredentials, and destroy filesystems.\n\nThen, in 2014, ESET [discovered a variant of the malware, calling it BlackEnergy Lite due to](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/09/22/back-in-blackenergy-2014/)\nits “lighter footprint.” BlackEnergy Lite can execute arbitrary code and steal data from hard\ndrives. Using a combination of both the regular and light versions, the BlackEnergy\noperators struck over a hundred targets in Poland and Ukraine, including governmental\norganizations.\n\nThe next time BlackEnergy reared its ugly head was in November 2015 when ESET\n[observed it delivering a destructive KillDisk component against Ukrainian news media](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/03/blackenergy-sshbeardoor-details-2015-attacks-ukrainian-news-media-electric-industry/)\ncompanies. KillDisk is a generic detection name for malware that overwrites documents\nwith random data and makes the operating system unbootable.\n\nA month later, in December, ESET detected another KillDisk variant at electricity distribution\ncompanies that appeared to contain functionality to sabotage specific industrial control\n[systems. ESET also discovered SSHBearDoor, a backdoored SSH server used as an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)\nalternative to BlackEnergy for gaining initial access to systems. With this three-part toolset,\n\n\n-----\n\n[BlackEnergy caused a 4–6 hour power outage for around 230,000 people in the Ivano-](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/04/blackenergy-trojan-strikes-again-attacks-ukrainian-electric-power-industry/)\nFrankivsk region of Ukraine on December 23, 2015. This was the first time in history that ard\ncyberattack was known to disrupt an electrical distribution system.\n\n### TeleBots targets financial institutions (2016)\n\n[ESET researchers discovered TeleBots, a successor of BlackEnergy, that was targeting](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/12/13/rise-telebots-analyzing-disruptive-killdisk-attacks/)\n[financial institutions in Ukraine. TeleBots was named for its abuse of the Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots)\nto disguise the communication between the attackers and the compromised computers as\nHTTP(S) traffic to a legitimate server – api.telegram.org. The malware operators set up\nTelegram accounts from which they could issue commands to compromised devices. ESET\nresearchers found a Telegram account belonging to one of the attackers.\n\nAs the final stage of these attacks, TeleBots deployed a destructive KillDisk variant that,\ninstead of deleting files, replaced them with new files containing one of two strings:\nmrR0b07 or fS0cie7y – a callout to the [Mr. Robot TV series.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot)\n\n[ESET also discovered KillDisk fake ransomware variants capable of encrypting both](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/01/05/killdisk-now-targeting-linux-demands-250k-ransom-cant-decrypt/)\nWindows and Linux machines. After being encrypted, Linux machines became unbootable\nand displayed a ransom note for 222 Bitcoin, approximately US$250,000 at the time.\n\nIf the victims reached deep into their pockets to pay up, the attackers couldn’t decrypt the\nfiles due to a deliberate flaw in the encryption scheme. However, ESET researchers did find\na weakness in the encryption employed in the Linux version of the ransomware making\nrecovery possible, albeit difficult.\n\n### Industroyer: Power outage in Kiev (2016)\n\nOn December 17, 2016, almost a year after the first electrical power disruption in Ukraine,th\na second blackout occurred. The power was out for about an hour in part of the capital,\n[Kiev. ESET researchers picked up new malware and named it Industroyer.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/12/industroyer-biggest-threat-industrial-control-systems-since-stuxnet/)\n\nIndustroyer is unique in its ability to speak several industrial communication protocols that\nare used worldwide in critical infrastructure systems for power supply, transportation control,\nwater, and gas. Because these protocols were developed decades ago and were intended\nfor use in offline systems, security was far from the foremost consideration in their design.\nThus, once Industroyer achieved access to systems running these protocols, it became a\nsimple matter to directly control the electricity substation switches and circuit breakers and\nturn off the power.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Protective relays for electrical substations – Industroyer spoke the language of this_\n\n_hardware_\n\nTo clean up traces of itself after an attack, Industroyer’s wiper module made systems\nunbootable and recovery harder by erasing system-crucial registry keys and overwriting\nfiles. At the time of this discovery, no connection was found between Industroyer and\nBlackEnergy.\n\n**_RELATED READING:_** **_[Industroyer2: Industroyer reloaded](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/04/12/industroyer2-industroyer-reloaded/)_**\n\n### US presidential campaign (2016)\n\nIn a year of intense political dueling between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton for the US\npresidency, two GRU units came into view for disrupting Clinton’s campaign. According to a\n[DoJ indictment, Unit 26165 spearheaded a data leak campaign, hacking into the email](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download)\naccounts of members of Clinton’s campaign and into the networks of the Democratic\nCongressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee.\n\nUnit 74455 supported the leak of documents and emails stolen in these hacks. The\nattackers took on the fictitious personas DCLeaks, as well as Guccifer 2.0 in a copycat\nattempt of the [original Guccifer who also leaked Clinton’s emails back in 2013.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/guccifer-hacker-who-revealed-clintons-use-of-a-private-email-address-sentenced-to-52-months/2016/09/01/4f42dc62-6f91-11e6-8365-b19e428a975e_story.html)\n\n### French presidential election (2017)\n\nSimilar to the hacks around the 2016 US presidential campaigns, Sandworm conducted\nseven spearphishing campaigns against the French presidential campaigns from April–May\n[2017, according to a DoJ indictment. More than 100 members of Emmanuel Macron’s party](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328521/download)\n_La République En Marche!, along with other political parties and local government entities,_\nwere targeted.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attackers set up a fake social media account to offer documents stolen from En\n_Marche! and eventually leaked them._\n\n### TeleBots ransomware attacks preceding NotPetya (2017)\n\nThe infamous NotPetya (aka Diskcoder.C) attack was part of a series of ransomware\nattacks conducted in Ukraine by TeleBots. In 2017, ESET detected updated versions of\nTeleBots’ tools along with two pieces of ransomware used in attacks against financial\ninstitutions in Ukraine.\n\nIn March, ESET detected the first of these TeleBots ransomware variants – Filecoder.NKH –\nwhich encrypted all files (except those located in the C:\\Windows directory).\n\nIn May, a week after the [WannaCryptor outbreak, ESET detected the second of these](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/05/14/wannacryptor-curious-tale/)\n[TeleBots ransomware samples – Filecoder.AESNI.C (aka XData). This ransomware is](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/05/23/xdata-ransomware-making-rounds-amid-global-wannacryptor-scare/)\nnamed from the fact that it checks whether a machine supports the Advanced Encryption\nStandard New Instructions (AES-NI) – a set of hardware instructions that speed up AES\nencryption and decryption.\n\n[ESET published a decryption tool for the Filecoder.AESNI ransomware.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/05/31/eset-releases-new-decryption-tool-aes-ni-ransomware/)\n\n### NotPetya attack (2017)\n\n[In June 2017, a month after the infamous WannaCryptor attack, NotPetya struck](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/27/new-ransomware-attack-hits-ukraine/)\norganizations in Ukraine, rapidly spreading globally with worm-like capability via connected\nnetworks. Like WannaCryptor, NotPetya spread itself using an exploit known as\n[EternalBlue, allegedly developed by the United States’ National Security Agency and then](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/05/10/one-year-later-eternalblue-exploit-wannacryptor/)\nstolen and dumped online by the Shadow Brokers hacking group. EternalBlue targets a\ncritical flaw in an outdated version of Microsoft’s Server Message Block (SMB)\nimplementation, which is used mainly for file and printer sharing in corporate networks.\nNotPetya also spread using the EternalRomance exploit, another SMB exploit leaked by\nShadow Brokers.\n\nIf successful, NotPetya encrypts either the entire drive or all files. At the time of the attack,\nIT admins rushed to shut down corporate computers before they could be sabotaged. For\nthose that were struck, decryption was not possible even in the case of paying the US$300\nransom.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. NotPetya ransom note_\n\n[ESET researchers tracked the origin of this global malware epidemic to the supplier of the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/07/04/analysis-of-telebots-cunning-backdoor/)\npopular Ukrainian accounting software M.E.Doc. The NotPetya operators had compromised\nM.E.Doc’s network and established access to an update server from which they sent a\nmalicious update, unleashing NotPetya on the world. At the time, ESET attributed NotPetya\nto the TeleBots group.\n\n[In the current round of the MITRE Engenuity ATT&CK evaluations (2022), two threat actors](https://attackevals.mitre-engenuity.org/enterprise/wizard-spider-and-sandworm/)\nare being put under the microscope: Wizard Spider and Sandworm. Both of these threat\nactors have deployed ransomware to disrupt the operations of victimized organizations.\nWizard Spider used Ryuk ransomware for encryption, while Sandworm used NotPetya\nransomware to destroy systems via encryption.\n\n### Olympic Destroyer impersonating Lazarus (2018)\n\nWhile the opening ceremony of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games was a\nspectacular show for attendees, an unusually high number of seats were empty.\nUnbeknownst to the crowd, a cyberattack was taking place that shut down Wi-Fi hotspots\nand telecasts, grounded broadcasters’ drones, took down the PyeongChang 2018 website,\nand broke the back-end servers of the Olympics’ official app, preventing eager spectators\nfrom loading their tickets and attending the ceremony.\n\nTwo months earlier, the attackers had compromised the networks of two third-party IT\ncompanies contracted to support the IT operations of the PyeongChang Organizing\nCommittee. On the fateful day of the ceremony – February 9 – it was an easy step for theth\nattackers to pivot from these partner companies to PyeongChang Organizing Committee’s\n\n\n-----\n\nnetwork and unleash Olympic Destroyer s wiper module, which deleted files and displayed\nBitLocker messages requesting a recovery key after a forced reboot, ultimately making\nthem inoperable.\n\nTo better hide its origin, Olympic Destroyer’s developers crafted some of the code to look\n[like malware used by Lazarus, the APT group held responsible for the global WannaCryptor](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032/)\nattack. A [DoJ indictment attributed Olympic Destroyer to Sandworm, yet some researchers](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328521/download)\nbelieve that Fancy Bear (aka Sofacy and APT28) was the more likely culprit.\n\n### Exaramel: Linking Industroyer to TeleBots (2018)\n\n[In April 2018, ESET discovered Exaramel, a new backdoor being used by the TeleBots](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/10/11/new-telebots-backdoor-linking-industroyer-notpetya/)\ngroup. When Industroyer knocked out the power in Ukraine in 2016, thoughts had\nimmediately turned to the power outage triggered by BlackEnergy in 2015. However, there\nwere no code similarities or other hints to link Industroyer to BlackEnergy or TeleBots.\nExaramel was the missing piece of the puzzle.\n\n_Figure 5. Links between TeleBots, BlackEnergy, Industroyer and (Not)Petya_\n\nThe analysis of Exaramel revealed a number of similarities with Industroyer:\n\nboth group their targets based on the security solution in use;\nboth have very similar code implementation of several backdoor commands;\nboth use a report file to store the output of executed shell commands and launched\nprocesses.\n\nAdditionally, Exaramel used the malicious domain um10eset[.]net, which was also used by\na Linux version of TeleBots malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n[ESET also discovered a Linux variant of Exaramel equipped with the usual backdoor](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/10/11/new-telebots-backdoor-linking-industroyer-notpetya/#:~:text=Analysis%20of%20the%20Linux/Exaramel%20backdoor)\ncapabilities to establish persistence, communicate to its operators, execute shell\ncommands, and download and upload files.\n\nUnlike Industroyer, Exaramel doesn’t directly target industrial control systems. ESET\ndetected these Windows and Linux Exaramel backdoors at a Ukrainian organization that\nwas not an industrial facility.\n\n[Similarly, in 2021, when France’s national cybersecurity agency ANSSI released a report on](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/02/17/attacks-targeting-it-firms-stir-concern-controversy/)\na malicious campaign exploiting outdated versions of the Centreon IT monitoring tool,\nExaramel reappeared, but again not at industrial facilities. Exaramel, in both its Windows\nand Linux variants, was discovered in the networks of web hosting providers in France.\n\n### GreyEnergy targets the energy sector (2015–2018)\n\nAround the time of BlackEnergy’s attack on Ukraine’s electrical power grid in 2015, ESET\n[started detecting malware that ESET researchers called GreyEnergy – another successor](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/10/17/greyenergy-updated-arsenal-dangerous-threat-actors/)\nto BlackEnergy in parallel with TeleBots. While TeleBots focused on financial institutions,\nGreyEnergy mainly targeted energy companies in Ukraine, but also in Poland.\n\nESET was the first to document GreyEnergy’s activities in 2018. The operators of this\nmalware stayed out of the spotlight for three years, engaging in espionage and\nreconnaissance instead of destructive attacks like TeleBots’ NotPetya and Industroyer.\n\nGreyEnergy is similar to BlackEnergy but stealthier, wiping its malware components from\nvictims’ hard drives to avoid detection. In December 2016, ESET noticed that GreyEnergy\ndeployed an early version of the NotPetya worm. After discovering that the malware authors\nhad used the internal filename moonraker.dll for this worm – likely in reference to the James\n[Bond film – ESET researchers eponymously named it Moonraker Petya.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonraker_(film))\n\nAlthough ESET researchers did not find any GreyEnergy components that specifically\ntarget industrial control systems, the operators seemed to be targeting servers with high\nuptime and workstations used to manage industrial control systems.\n\n### Georgia (2019)\n\n[On October 28, 2019, according to a DoJ indictment, Sandworm defaced around 15,000th](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328521/download)\n[websites hosted in Georgia, in many cases posting an image of Mikheil Saakashvili, a](https://www.zdnet.com/article/largest-cyber-attack-in-georgias-history-linked-to-hacked-web-hosting-provider/)\nformer Georgian president known for opposing Russian influence in Georgia, with the\ncaption “I’ll be back”. The attack was orchestrated via a hack of Pro-Service, a Georgian\nweb hosting provider.\n\nThe attack evoked memories of the BlackEnergy DDoS attacks on Georgian websites back\nin 2008.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Cyclops Blink (2022)\n\nThe day before Russia’s invasion into Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the USth\n[Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published an alert on Cyclops](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-054a)\nBlink, a newly discovered piece of Linux malware that enslaves WatchGuard Firebox\ndevices to its botnet.\n\n\nAccording to the [technical analysis of the malware published by the UK’s National Cyber](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Cyclops-Blink-Malware-Analysis-Report.pdf)\nSecurity Centre (NCSC), the malicious developers found a weakness that allowed the\nmalware to pose as a legitimate firmware update of these devices. After a malicious update,\nto achieve persistence, a script automatically executes Cyclops Blink each time the\ncompromised device restarts.\n\nCyclops Blink comes with a core component that poses as a kernel thread and several\nmodules for gathering system information, downloading and uploading files, updating itself\nand persisting after reboot, and storing command and control server information.\n\nWhile CISA has not yet revealed which hints led them to attributing Cyclops Blink to\n[Sandworm, organizations are strongly advised to audit whether they have enabled the](https://techsearch.watchguard.com/KB?type=Article&SFDCID=kA16S000000SNyiSAG&lang=en_US)\nremote management interface to their Firebox devices, as this opens them immediately to\nthese attacks without the patch.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSince February 24, 2022, a host of malware targeting Ukrainian organizations, liketh\n[HermeticWiper,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/02/24/hermeticwiper-new-data-wiping-malware-hits-ukraine/) [HermeticWizard, HermeticRansom, IsaacWiper, and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/) [CaddyWiper has hit](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/15/caddywiper-new-wiper-malware-discovered-ukraine/)\nthe headlines. Currently, the Hermetic malware family, IsaacWiper, and CaddyWiper remain\nunattributed, leaving one question hanging heavily in the air: Is Sandworm back to its\nmischief?\n\nAs cybersecurity vendors around the world continue to sift through their malware telemetry\nfor clues, we may expect that more and more pieces of the puzzle will be put together.\nHowever, it may be that the disparate pieces will lead current theories increasingly astray.\nAfter all, skulduggery is part and parcel of the tactics employed by sophisticated threat\ngroups.\n\n_One last word about keeping malware names straight. In the flurry of recent discoveries of_\n_malware in Ukraine, several of the same pieces of malware have been given different_\n_names. So, remember that HermeticWiper is the same as FoxBlade, and HermeticRansom_\n_is the same as Elections GoRansom, and PartyTicket._\n\n21 Mar 2022 - 11:30AM\n\n\n-----\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
