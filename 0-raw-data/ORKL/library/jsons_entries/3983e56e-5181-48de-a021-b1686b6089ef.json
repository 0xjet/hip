So that’s all sorted then, pack it up, we’re\ndone.\n\n[— Barry Dorrans (@blowdart) June 13, 2021](https://twitter.com/blowdart/status/1404145530494586883?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nGreat to see ransomware payments being raised at G7. I’d like to see some options of\nhow organisations can be supported by government before we hail blocking payments\nas the solution. Too much talk of “fix backups and the problem is solved”, it’s never that\nsimple.\n\n[— Tom Hall (@thall_sec) June 12, 2021](https://twitter.com/thall_sec/status/1403720364019040257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nMost ransomware gangs are believed to operate from within the borders of former Soviet\nstates.\n\nMost of these groups operate under unwritten rules that as long as they launch attacks\nexclusively against western countries and avoid Russia and its neighboring countries, they\nare left to operate in peace by local authorities.\n\nPreviously, US intelligence said that at least one cybercrime group’s members (Evil Corp)\noperate under protection and in cooperation with Russia’s internal intelligence service, the\nFederal Security Service (FSB).\n\nEarlier today, Lindy Cameron, chief executive of the UK National Cyber Security Centre,\n[called ransomware attacks the biggest online threat to UK users, far greater than nation-](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jun/14/ransomware-is-biggest-online-threat-to-people-in-uk-spy-agency-chief-to-warn)\nstate hacking groups, highlighting that while state-sponsored groups might go after a limited\nnumber of targets and engage in silent espionage, ransomware gangs operate\nindiscriminately and have no reservations in causing large-scale disruptions in order to\nextract ransom payments.\n\n\n-----\n\nTags\n\n[cybercrime](https://therecord.media/tag/cybercrime/)\n[G7](https://therecord.media/tag/g7/)\n[Government](https://therecord.media/tag/government/)\n[politics](https://therecord.media/tag/politics/)\n[Ransomware](https://therecord.media/tag/ransomware/)\n[Russia](https://therecord.media/tag/russia/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
