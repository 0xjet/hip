Once\ninstalled the fake download requests accessibility permissions that allow an attack to take\n\n\n-----\n\nplace. The malware overlays login screens for banking apps, stealing credentials for its\noperators. Cerberus also has a crafty evasion technique—using the accelerometer on an\ninfected device to ensure the target is real and not a desk-based security analyst.\n\nThe developers behind Cerberus are reportedly renting the trojan out on the dark web and\nhave taken the unusual step of advertising their capabilities on Twitter. The threat actors\neven use their Twitter account to mock the security community tasked with trying to stop\nthem—and they are so confident, they even tried to sell the bot to a well known malware\nanalyst so he could examine their work.\n\nCerberus infects users when they access a fake website which immediately requests a\ndownload of Adobe Flash Player. The download is fake, and carries the malware payload.\n\n**[A video of the infection process can be seen here.](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1162315627052306432)**\n\nAndroid banking trojans are nothing new, and Cerberus is just the latest in a long line of such\nmalware to hit the headlines. Even the fact that Cerberus is being \"rented out\" on\nunderground forums is not unique. Malware \"for hire\" has become a theme.\n\nCerberus has been designed to steal banking credentials. It does this—again not unusually\n—by creating overlays on top of banking apps that capture usernames and passwords as\nthey are being entered. Such overlays are designed around specific apps, and Cerberus has\ndeveloped more than 30 of these thus far. Of note, the target banks are in the U.S., France\nand Japan—a fairly specific list of countries.\n\nESET security researcher Lukas Stefanko told me he \"found Cerberus in June, a couple of\ndays after it was published on an underground forum.\" Stefanko used Twitter to ask the\nresearch community if anyone had come across it before, \"and that is when I noticed their\ntwitter handle joined the debate under my tweet.\"\n\n\"Even though they know I am android malware analyst,\" Stefanko told me, \"they tried to sell\nme their Cerberus bot. They created a profile where the only thing I needed to do is buy it.\nHowever my goal was to obtain working sample and C&C address to properly analyze it.\"\nThe developers sent Stefanko a sample of Cerberus, but used his Twitter handle \"instead of\na real C&C server,\" and so he was unable to test it.\n\nTwo days later, Stefanko and colleagues \"detected an active campaign using this new\nbanking Trojan with thousands of website visits that contained the payload. Cerberus was\nspread via a fake website that asked users to install Adobe Flash Player.\"\n\nLukas Stefanko\n\nStefanko explained to me that the Cerberus developers used \"a web framework where\nanyone can check website visit statistics—because of that I found out which countries are\ntargeted with actual number of site visits.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nOver a fourteen day period, Stefanko tracked more than 13,000 visits to the fake Cerberus\nwebsite, most of which were from users in the U.S. and Japan.\n\nAt about the same time, Cerberus was seen being rented out in underground forums by the\nteam at [ThreatFabric. The malware's developers claimed it had been used privately for two](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/cerberus-a-new-banking-trojan-from-the-underworld.html)\nyears beforehand, and that it was \"written from scratch\" and does not \"borrow\" code from\nexisting malware, making it harder to detect. There is certainly none of the leaked Anubis\nsource code within Cerberus.\n\n\"Rental of banking Trojans is not new,\" the researchers explain. \"It was an existing business\nmodel when computer-based banking malware was the only form of banking malware and\nhas shifted to the Android equivalent a few years later.\"\n\nCerberus often comes as a social media attachment, so the usual caution on thinking before\nclicking applies. The malware uses its Flash Player application to trick user into granting\naccessibility rights. The malware can then grant itself additional rights to control the device,\nsend messages, make calls, communicate back to its handlers. It can even disable Google\nPlay Protect to avoid automatic detection.\n\nNone of which its unusual. And so the clever stuff—Cerberus has been designed to avoid\ndetection from desk-based malware analysts by delaying activation until it can confirm the\ndevice belongs to a genuine victim. It uses the device's accelerometer to measure steps.\n\"The Trojan uses this counter to activate the bot,\" ThreatFabric explains. And when the step\ncounter hits a target, \"it considers running on the device to be safe.\" This counter-measure\n\"prevents the Trojan from running and being analyzed in dynamic analysis environments\n(sandboxes) and on test devices.\"\n\nBut the real standout for Cerberus is that its developers have even taken to Twitter to \"post\npromotional content (even videos) about the malware\" and to \"make fun of the antivirus\ncommunity—sharing detection screenshots from VirusTotal (thus leaking IoC) and even\nengaging in discussions with malware researchers directly.\"\n\nCerberus is not seen as \"moving the needle\" for trojan capabilities, but it's dangerous\nnonetheless. \"Cerberus should not be taken lightly,\" ThreatFabric warns. It can harvest\ncontacts, send messages, steal credentials. And its overlays are not limited to banking apps\n—it can attack messaging or other accounts using the same techniques.\n\nThe rental model is interesting—it ensures the malware can evolve and spread quickly, and it\nincreases the likely damage during its lifespan. There is also the question of the apps\ncoverage thus far—U.S., France and Japan. If those were created to order, then the rental\nmodel will quickly add more.\n\nBut the most interesting element to Cerberus is the cat and mouse game playing out in the\nopen as its developers taunt the catcher community. And as entertaining as those Twitter\nexchanges might be it's important to remember there are many thousands of victims of\n\n\n-----\n\nCerberus whose lives will be badly impacted.\n\nAnd so, as ever, the usual advice applies. Take care what you download and install—avoid\ngimmicks and untrusted sources, use common sense. Our smartphones are the keys to our\ndigital worlds, and malware like Cerberus is designed to steal those keys while avoiding\ndetection in ever more clever ways.\n\n[Zak Doffman](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/)\n\n\n-----",
