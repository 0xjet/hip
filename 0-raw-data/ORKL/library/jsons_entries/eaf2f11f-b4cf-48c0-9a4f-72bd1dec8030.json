This\nstealer was named LummaC2 Stealer, which targets crypto wallets, extensions, and two-factor\nauthentication (2FA) and steals sensitive information from the victim’s machine.\n\nThe figure below shows the dark web post by the Threat Actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 – Dark Web Post for LummaC2 Stealer\nThe post also mentioned the link to LummaC2 Stealer’s seller website, which is written in Russian. The\nwebsite also offers various purchasing options for potential Threat Actors(TAs), with prices ranging from\n$250 to $20000 depending on the plan.\n\nThe image below shows the website where the stealer is available for sale.\n\nFigure 2 – LummaC2 Stealer Sellers Website\nIn addition, Threat Actors (TAs) behind the LummaC2 Stealer have created two Telegram channels in\nRussian: one for sharing information about the stealer and one for reporting bugs in the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 – Telegram Post by the Threat Actors\nThe researchers at CRIL found two active Command and Control servers connected to the LummaC2\nStealer.\n\nThe figure below illustrates the IP addresses of these servers, one located in Bulgaria and the other in\nGermany.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4 – LummaC2 Stealer C&C IPs\nThe figure below shows the login page of the LummaC2 Stealer’s Command and Control (C&C) server.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5 – LummaC2 C&C panel Login Page\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThe LummaC2 Stealer is a 32-bit GUI type executable with sha256\nd932ee10f02ea5bb60ed867d9687a906f1b8472f01fc5543b06f9ab22059b264.\n\nThe figure below shows the additional file details of the LummaC2 stealer executable.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6 – File Details of LummaC2 Stealer\n\n## Detection Evasion:\n\nThe stealer has many Obfuscated strings that are being covered by a random string, “edx765”, to evade\ndetection. Upon execution, the stealer passes the obfuscated string to a function that strips the random\nstring and delivers the original string.\n\nThe figure below shows the routine for string manipulation.\n\nFigure 7 – Assembly Code to Replace the edx765 String\n\n## Collects System Information:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter getting the required strings, the malware resolves the APIs. It starts extracting multiple pieces of\ninformation from the system, including LummaC2 Build, Lumma ID, Hardware ID, Screen Resolution,\nSystem Language, CPU Name, and Physical Memory. The malware stores this information in the memory\nunder the name system.txt.\n\nThe below figure shows the code snippet of malware for collecting system information.\n\nFigure\n\n8 – System Information Extracted by the Stealer\n\n## File Grabber:\n\nThe stealer now enumerates the %userProfile% directory and grabs .txt files from the Victims machine.\nThese grabbed files are stored in the memory under the name “Important Files/Profile” for exfiltration.\n\n## Wallets:\n\nThe stealer also targets crypto wallets such as Binance, Electrum, and Ethereum and collects sensitive\ninformation from the victim’s machine. The below figure shows the code snippet of stealers targeting\ncrypto wallets.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9 – The\n\nStealer Targeting Wallets\nAfter collecting the victim’s wallet and system details, the stealer sends this information to its C&C server,\nas shown below.\n\nFigure 10 – Initial C&C Communication of the Stealer\n\n## Browsers:\n\nAfter sending the stolen information, the stealer checks for the following browsers installed on the system:\nChrome, Chromium, Edge, Kometa, Vivaldi, Brave, Opera Stable, Opera GX Stable, Opera Neon, and\nMozilla Firefox and steals sensitive information from the browsers.\n\nThe figure below shows the code to check the browsers.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11 – Stealer Checking for the Browsers in System\n\n## Crypto Wallets and 2FA Extensions:\n\nThe stealer now searches for more information associated with the browser, such as crypto wallet and\ntwo-factor authentication (2FA) extensions that may have been installed.\n\nThe figure below shows the wallets and 2FA extensions that the stealer targets.\n\nFigure 12 – Stealer Targeting Crypto Wallet And 2FA Extensions\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, the stealer can also steal browser history, login information, network cookies, and more from\nthe system, as shown below.\n\nFigure 13 – Stealer Targeting Sensitive Browser Information\n\n## Command & Control Communication\n\nFinally, the stealer encrypts the data obtained from the infected system and sends it to the C&C server, as\nshown below.\n\nThe figure below depicts the C&C communication of the stealer.\n\nFigure 14 – C&C Communication of the LummaC2 Stealer\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLummaC2 behaves in a manner comparable to other stealer-type malware, which can take away both\nsystem and sensitive data from the victim’s machine. These dangerous programs usually have the\ncapacity to take information from web browsers and target Crypto wallets and 2FA extensions.\n\nThe additional information stored on web browsers, such as login credentials, PII, and financial\ninformation, can be further leveraged to conduct fraud activities as well.\n\n\n-----\n\nThreat actors can use the stolen data to steal cryptocurrencies from the victim s accounts, or alternatively,\nthey can sell this data to other threat actors for financial gain.\n\nCRIL continuously monitors emerging threats and will continue to keep readers informed.\n\n## Our Recommendations\n\nWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against\nattackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:\n\n### Safety Measures Needed to Prevent Malware Attacks\n\nRefrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their authenticity.\nUse a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected devices,\nincluding PC, laptop, and mobile.\nConduct regular backup practices and keep those backups offline or in a separate network.\nTurn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected\ndevices wherever possible and pragmatic.\n\n### Users Should Take the Following Steps After the Malware Attack\n\nDetach infected devices on the same network.\nDisconnect external storage devices if connected.\nInspect system logs for suspicious events.\n\n### Impact And Cruciality of Malware\n\nLoss of valuable data.\nLoss of the organization’s reputation and integrity.\nLoss of the organization’s sensitive business information.\nDisruption in organization operation.\nMonetary loss.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK® Techniques\n\n**Tactic** **Technique ID** **Technique Name**\n\n\n**Defense Evasion** [T1140](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140/)\n\n[T1562](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/)\n\n**Discovery** [T1082](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)\n\n[T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/)\n\n**Collection** [T1119](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119/)\n\n[T1005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005/)\n\n\nDeobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\n\nImpair Defences\n\nSystem Information Discovery\n\nFile and Directory Discovery\n\nAutomated Collection\n\nData from the Local System\n\n\n**Command and Control** [T1071](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/) Application Layer Protocol\n\n**Exfiltration** [T1020](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020/) Automated Exfiltration\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Indicators** **Indicator**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\nLummaC2\nBinary\n\nLummaC2\nBinary\n\nLummaC2\nBinary\n\nLummaC2\nBinary\n\n\n**1995a54dba0e05d80903d3d210c1e3da**\n**c43316ddcb51e143ab53f996587c23ea4985f6ea**\n**277d7f450268aeb4e7fe942f70a9df63aa429d703e9400370f0621a438e918bf**\n\n**a09daf5791d8fd4b5843cd38ae37cf97**\n**2c11592f527a35c3dac75139e870dd062b12dfe1**\n**60247d4ddd08204818b60ade4bfc32d6c31756c574a5fe2cd521381385a0f868**\n\n**5aac51312dfd99bf4e88be482f734c79**\n**9ac88b93fee8f888cabc3d0c9d81507c6dad7498**\n**9b742a890aff9c7a2b54b620fe5e1fcfa553648695d79c892564de09b850c92b**\n\n**c9c0e32e00d084653db0b37a239e9a34**\n**b97965e4a793ec0fa10abc86d0c6be5718716d8a**\n**d932ee10f02ea5bb60ed867d9687a906f1b8472f01fc5543b06f9ab22059b264**\n\n\nMD5\nSHA1\nSHA256\n\nMD5\nSHA1\nSHA256\n\nMD5\nSHA1\nSHA256\n\nMD5\nSHA1\nSHA256\n\n\n195[.]123[.]226[.]91 IP LummaC2\nC&C\n\n144[.]76[.]173[.]247 IP LummaC2\nC&C\n\n\n-----",
