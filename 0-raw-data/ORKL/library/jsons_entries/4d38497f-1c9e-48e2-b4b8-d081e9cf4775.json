The researchers estimate there are about\n30 different such affiliates across the LokiLocker samples that they have found in the wild.\n\nLike other cyber threats, such as distributed denial-of-services (DDoS), ransomware has\nevolved in recent years to include bad actors offering to lease their malware as a service to\nother criminals, enabling those less skilled to fire off relatively sophisticated campaigns via\nsomeone else's malicious code and backend infrastructure.\n\nMcAfee last year [issued a threat report that showed a significant drop in the incidence of](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/lp/threats-reports/jun-2021.html)\nransomware in the first quarter of 2021. However, the decline had less to do with\ncybercriminals embracing other attack methods and more with many of them using RaaS\ncampaigns that target fewer but larger organizations that bring in more money than mass\nmulti-target ransomware attacks.\n\nBlackBerry researchers say there are victims around the world, which isn't surprising given\nthat different affiliates may have different targeting patterns. Most so far are in Eastern\nEurope and Asia.\n\nThe researchers are still trying to determine the origins of the RaaS family but wrote that all\nthe embedded debugging strings are in English and mostly free of the kinds of mistakes and\nmisspellings typically seen in malware coming from Russia or China. Some of the earliest\nknown LokiLocker affiliates have usernames that are found exclusively on Iranian hacking\nchannels.\n\n\"Also, perhaps more interestingly, some of the cracking tools used to distribute the very first\nsamples of LokiLocker seem to be developed by an Iranian cracking team called\nAccountCrack,\" says Blackberry. \"Moreover, at least three of the known LokiLocker affiliates\nuse unique usernames that can be found on Iranian hacking channels. It's not entirely clear\nwhether this means they truly originate from Iran or that the real threat actors are trying to\ncast the blame on Iranian attackers.\"\n\nIn addition, the malware appears to contain a list of countries to exclude from encryption and\nin the samples the BlackBerry researchers have seen, the only country on the list is Iran.\n\n\"It seems that this functionality is not yet implemented, as there are no references to this\narray in the code,\" the researchers write. \"However, like the references to Iranian attackers\nand hacking tools, it could just as well be a false flag meant to misdirect our attention\" and\nput blame on Iran.\n\nThe malware is written in .NET and protected with NETGuard – a commercial product that\nthe researchers call a \"modified ConfuserEX,\" an open-source tool for protecting .NET\napplications – while also using KoiVM a virtualization plugin It used to be a licensed\n\n\n-----\n\ncommercial protection for .NET applications, but after its code was open-sourced in 2018, it\nbecame publicly available on GitHub.\n\nThe use of KoiVM as a protector is an unusual method for complicating analysis of the\nmalware that hasn't been seen with many other threat actors and may mark the start of a\nnew trend, according to BlackBerry.\n\nThe ransomware uses a combination of AES for file encryption and RSA for key protection to\nencrypt documents on victims' local hard drives and network shares. It then tells the victims\nto email the attackers to receive instructions for paying the ransom.\n\nAn early sample of the ransomware was distributed inside trojanized brute-checker hacking\ntools, including PayPal BruteCheck, Spotify BruteChecker, PiaVNP Brute Checker by\nACTEAM, and FPSN Checker by Angeal. Such tools are used to automate validation of\nstolen accounts and get access to other accounts through credential stuffing, in which\nhackers use usernames and passwords stolen from one website to log into other websites,\nsometimes using a botnet to accelerate the process.\n\n\"It's possible that the LokiLocker version distributed with these hacking tools constituted\nsome kind of beta testing phase before the malware was offered to a wider range of\naffiliates,\" the researchers say.\n\nLike other ransomware, LokiLocker puts a time limit for paying the ransom and will make the\nsystem unusable if the payment isn't made. However, if configured to do so, the malware\nalso includes a wiper function that will erase the data if the payment deadline passes.\n\n\"It will delete files on all of the victim's drives, except for the system files, and it will also try to\noverwrite the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the system drive to render the system unusable,\"\nthe researchers write, adding that the victims are greeted with this message: \"You did not\npay us. So we deleted all your files :)\"\n\nPresumably this is so that there's no chance at all to recover the scrambled documents, save\nfrom backups. In addition, after overwriting the MBR, the ransomware will try to crash the\nsystem by forcing a Blue Screen of Death.\n\nThe wiper function is part of an escalation by ransomware gangs in recent years to\nencourage victims to pay the ransom by including additional threats beyond just refusing to\ndecrypt the files, such as erasing data or leaking stolen files on the dark web.\n\nThere are no free tools to decrypt files captured by LokiLocker and BlackBerry – like the FBI\nand other security authorities – urge victims not to pay the ransom, arguing that it adds fuel\nto the global growth in ransomware and there is no guarantee they will get their data\nreturned. Also, even if it is returned, the hackers could have put a backdoor into the system,\nmaking the organization more vulnerable to future attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter all, people who pay one ransom can often be persuaded to pay another, the team at\nBlackBerry concludes. ®\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\nBig Tech loves talking up privacy – while trying to kill privacy legislation\n\nStudy claims Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft work to derail data rules\n\n[Thomas Claburn in San Francisco Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:48 UTC](https://www.theregister.com/Author/Thomas-Claburn)\nAmazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft often support privacy in public\nstatements, but behind the scenes they've been working through some common\norganizations to weaken or kill privacy legislation in US states.\n\n[That's according to a report this week from news non-profit The Markup, which said the](https://themarkup.org/privacy/2022/05/26/tech-industry-groups-are-watering-down-attempts-at-privacy-regulation-one-state-at-a-time)\ncorporations hire lobbyists from the same few groups and law firms to defang or drown\nstate privacy bills.\n\nThe report examined 31 states when state legislatures were considering privacy\nlegislation and identified 445 lobbyists and lobbying firms working on behalf of Amazon,\nApple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, along with industry groups like TechNet and the\nState Privacy and Security Coalition.\n\n[Continue reading](https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/27/big_tech_privacy/?td=keepreading-btm)\n\n\n-----\n\nSEC probes Musk for not properly disclosing Twitter stake\n\nMeanwhile, social network's board rejects resignation of one its directors\n\n[Katyanna Quach Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:26 UTC](https://www.theregister.com/Author/Katyanna-Quach)\nAmerica's financial watchdog is investigating whether Elon Musk adequately disclosed\nhis purchase of Twitter shares last month, just as his bid to take over the social media\ncompany hangs in the balance.\n\n[A letter [PDF] from the SEC addressed to the tech billionaire said he \"[did] not appear\"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000000000022003713/filename1.pdf)\n[to have filed the proper form detailing his 9.2 percent stake in Twitter \"required 10 days](https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/04/elon_musk_twitter/)\nfrom the date of acquisition,\" and asked him to provide more information.
