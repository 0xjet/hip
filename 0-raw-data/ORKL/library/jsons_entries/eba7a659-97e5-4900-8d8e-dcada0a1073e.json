This technique has also been\nobserved in phishing attacks, where cloud storage services are used to host phishing\npages.\n\nSome of the warning signs that users generally look out for in a phishing attack include\nsuspicious-looking domains, or websites without a HTTPS certificate. However, by using\nwell-known public cloud services such as Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure to host their\nphishing pages, the attackers can overcome this obstacle and disguise their malicious\nintent, improving their chances of ensnaring even security-savvy victims.\n\nThis was the case with a phishing attack we came across in January. The attack started\nwith a PDF document that was uploaded to Google Drive, and included a link to a phishing\npage:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe phishing page, hosted on storage.googleapis[.]com/asharepoint-unwearied439052791/index.html, asked the user to login with their Office 365 or organization e-mail:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen choosing one of the options, a pop-up window with the Outlook login page appears:\n\nAfter the credentials were entered, the user is led to a real PDF report published by a\nrenowned global consulting firm:\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring all of these stages, the user never gets suspicious since the phishing page is hosted\non Google Cloud Storage. However, viewing the phishing page’s source code has revealed\nthat most of the resources are loaded from a website that belongs to the attackers,\nprvtsmtp[.]com:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn more recent attacks, even a sharp-eyed, savvy user might miss this, as the attackers\nstarted using Google Cloud Functions, a service that allows the running of code in the\ncloud. In this case, the resources in the phishing page were loaded from a Google Cloud\nFunctions instance without exposing the attackers’ own malicious domains:\n\nInvestigating prvtsmtp[.]com showed that it resolved to a Ukrainian IP address\n(31.28.168[.]4). Many other domains related to this phishing attack resolved to the same IP\naddress, or to different ones on the same netblock.\n\nThis gave us an insight into the attackers’ malicious activity over the years and allowed us\nto see how they have been developing their campaigns and introducing new techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, we saw that back in 2018, the attackers used to host the phishing pages on\nthe malicious websites directly. Later on, and before switching to Google Cloud Storage, the\nattackers took advantage of Azure Storage to host the phishing pages:\n\nThe attackers in this case seem to be taking advantage of different cloud storage services,\na technique that has been gaining popularity due to the difficulties involved in detecting it.\nBecause such services usually have legitimate uses and do not appear suspicious, both\nvictims and network administrators have more difficulty identifying and fending off such\nattacks.\n\nGoogle suspended this particular hacker project in January 2020 for phishing abuse, which\nsubsequently suspended the URL as well as all URLs associated with that project since that\ntime. Google investigates and suspends phishing pages when we become aware of them\nthrough Safe Browsing data feeds and other direct reports.\n\nThis incident highlights the efforts that scammers and criminals will make to conceal their\nmalicious intentions, and to trick even security-savvy users. As we’ve noted in many\nprevious blogs, practical steps we can all take to stay protected against these opportunistic\nattacks are:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Beware of lookalike domains, spelling errors in emails or websites, and unfamiliar\n\nemail senders.\n2. Be cautious with files received via email from unknown senders, especially if they\n\nprompt for a certain action you would not usually do.\n3. Ensure you are ordering goods from an authentic source. One way to do this is NOT\n\nto click on promotional links in emails, and instead, Google your desired retailer and\nclick the link from the Google results page.\n4. Beware of “special” offers. “An exclusive cure for coronavirus for $150” is usually not a\n\nreliable or trustworthy purchase opportunity.\n5. Make sure you do not reuse passwords between different applications and accounts.\n\n[Organizations should prevent zero-day attacks with end-to-end cyber architectures, to block](https://www.checkpoint.com/solutions/zero-day-protection/)\ndeceptive phishing sites and provide alerts on password reuse in real time. And remember\nthat your users’ mailboxes are the front door into your organization. Targeted phishing\n[schemes steal $300B from businesses every month, so considers using email security](https://www.checkpoint.com/products/email-security/)\nmeasures too.\n\n\n-----",
