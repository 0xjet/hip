However, recent threats to our_\n_nation’s critical infrastructure have prompted a tightening of_\n_security measures across many different industry sectors._\n_Reducing control system vulnerabilities against physical and cyber_\n_attack is necessary to ensure the safety, reliability, integrity and_\n_availability of these systems. The U.S. Department of Homeland_\n_Security has developed a strategy to secure these vulnerabilities._\n_Crucial to this strategy is the Control Systems Security and Test_\n_Center (CSSTC) established to test and analyze control systems_\n_and their components. In addition, the CSSTC promotes a_\n_proactive, collaborative approach to increase industry’s_\n_awareness of standards, products and processes that can enhance_\n_the security of control systems. This paper outlines measures that_\n_can be taken to enhance the cybersecurity of process control_\n_systems in the chemical sector._\n\n### 1. INTRODUCTION\n\nEvidences of safe working environments and practices and secure working places are\nfound in almost every chemical plant. The evidence for cybersecurity is not as readily\napparent. However, keeping computers and networks free from viruses and hackers (and\navailable for productive use) is just as important as keeping thieves and terrorists out of\nthe plant. The purpose of this paper is to establish the need for cybersecurity for the\nchemical industry and to identify the common vulnerabilities of control systems.\n\n### 2. DISCUSSION\n\n**The Safety Mind-Frame**\n\n\n-----\n\nSecurity, like safety, must be an integral part of any chemical process. Operating\nprocedures are developed with the safety of workers, the public, and our environment in\nmind. Equipment is designed with safety in mind. The proper protective equipment is\nworn with safety in mind. Physical security surrounds the chemical plant. “Guards,\ngates and guns” are used to ensure the environment is safe for the workers. It protects the\ndocuments and processes that are business sensitive and classified. The right people are\nlet through the guard gate and the wrong people are kept out.\nBoth physical security and cybersecurity are put in place with safety in mind.\ncybersecurity protects control systems to keep the chemical processes working safely and\nefficiently. It ensures the data are not compromised. It keeps the computer viruses,\nworms, Trojans, etc. from infecting the computers on the network and from affecting the\ncontrol systems. It lets the right people access the controls and information, and keeps\nthe wrong people off the controls denying them access to sensitive and proprietary\ninformation and out of the network.\n\n**Cybersecurity – Is the Threat Real?**\n\nCybersecurity threats are real and they happen every day to people in all walks of life.\nWith the modernization of control system equipment more systems are interconnected\nand more importantly, more systems are linked at some level to the internet. With each\nadditional connection comes one more doorway by which a hacker, curious or malicious,\ncan enter. Additionally the control system networks are becoming more public.\nOperations within a chemical or electrical have traditionally been closed and little was\nknown about them to the outsider.  Last year at one of the principle cyber forums in this\ncountry, a hacker gave a presentation on control systems. Interest and curiosity is rising\nalong with the visibility.\nCyber attacks can slow the computer’s response and the networks speed or bring\neverything to a complete halt, causing a denial of service. Cyber attacks can also cause\nunwanted and unexpected results. In the world of chemical processing where efficiency\nis critical to making a profit, an undetected cyber attack can slow the process and reduce\nthe efficiency of the plant. An article from the Rand Corporation stated, “Attacks in\ncyberspace blur traditional boundaries between nations and private interests, cannot be\nforeseen or tracked via classical intelligence methods, and are all but indistinguishable\nfrom accidents, system failures or even hacker pranks.”[1] The critical infrastructure of the\nUnited States provides many lucrative targets.\nA well known example of a cyber attack that had disastrous results occurred in\nAustralia. A contractor who had been instrumental in installing the network for a waste\nmanagement company “caused millions of litres of raw sewage to spill out into local\nparks, rivers and even the grounds of a Hyatt Regency hotel. . . Marine life died, the\ncreek water turned black and the stench was unbearable for residents.”[2] A series of cyber\nattacks had been occurring for at least 2 months before the waste management company\nlearned what was happening and identified the source of the trouble.\nIn January 2003, the slammer worm caused the Internet to slow down to a crawl. The\nBank of America reported “that customers at a majority of its 13,000 automatic teller\nmachines were unable to process customer transactions.”[3] It is not hard to imagine how a\n\n\n-----\n\nChemical process could become paralyzed if a similar worm were to infect their network\nsystem.\nThe CERT Coordination Center has kept statistics on the number of incidents that\nhave been reported to them between 1988 and 2003. The number of cybersecurity\nincidents reported each year has been rising rapidly. In 1999, there were about 10,000\nincidents reported. In 2003, there were almost 140,000 incidents reported. This\nexponential increase in incidents demonstrates another interesting and important fact.\nThere are more and more people who are proliferating cyber attacks. As shown in Figure\n1, the cyber attacks are becoming more and more sophisticated yet the average person’s\nknowledge required to spawn an attack is actually being reduced. One of the major\nreasons for this is because the internet has enabled hackers to share their experiences and\ntechniques and obtain tools. For example, a New Jersey man was charged with computer\ncriminal activity and attempted criminal activity for placing spyware on his landlord’s\ncomputer to see how she was going to proceed collecting a $10,000 judgment from him.\nA service provider verified that the spyware came from his email address. He is currently\nout on $30,000 bail.[4]\n\n### � Threats More Complex as Attackers Proliferate\n\n\n**Malicious Code**\n\n\n**High**\n\n**Low**\n\n\n**BOTS**\n\n\n**Password Cracking**\n**Self-Replicating Code**\n**Password Guessing**\n\n\n**1980      1985      1990      1995      2000** **2005     2010**\n\n\n**Figure 1 – Intruder Knowledge vs. Attack Sophistication**\n\nCyber threats are real. Cyber attacks come from a wide variety of sources including,\nviruses/worms/trojans/etc, an insider or a disgruntled employee, neighborhood hackers,\nindustrial espionage, terrorists. Reconnaissance is typically a pre-cursor to an attack. All\nof the above mentioned sources can cause problems with control systems. However,\nsome of these sources have the intent to create problems on a very large scale. Two\nexamples are note worthy. First, the Washington Times reported that “China is actively\ndeveloping options to create chaos on the island, to compromise components of Taiwan’s\ncritical infrastructure.”[5] Then Media Corp News reported that “North Korea has trained\nmore than 500 computer hackers capable of launching cyber warfare against the United\nStates. . . The Military hackers had been put through a five-year university course\n\n\n-----\n\ntraining them to penetrate the computer systems of South Korea, the United States and\nJapan.”[6]\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has an objective to “create a\nnational-level capability to coordinate between government and industry to reduce\nvulnerabilities and respond to the threats associated with the control systems that\ncomprise our National Critical Infrastructure.”[7] The mission of the DHS National Cyber\nSecurity Division is to be the focal point for addressing cyber security issues in the\nUnited States.”[8] In order to accomplish that mission, the DHS National Cyber Security\nDivision has established the Control System Security and Test Center (CSSTC). The\nCSSTC is working to identify, analyze and eliminate vulnerabilities associated with the\ncontrol systems in critical infrastructure applications. A major effort is being made to\nincrease awareness of the need for cybersecurity and what to do to reduce vulnerabilities\nin control systems.\nTaking action to reduce or eliminate a vulnerability will reduce the probability of a\nsuccessful cyber attack. There are common things that any company can do to reduce the\nvulnerabilities in their control system. Below are the top 10 vulnerabilities commonly\nfound within control systems.\n\n**Top 10 Vulnerabilities in Control Systems**\n\n**10.** **Insufficient network separation (protection) between corporate and real-**\n**time control systems. The corporate and process control networks should be**\nseparated by a properly configured firewall. The architecture of the network\nis essential to good cybersecurity. Figure 2 shows the recommended network\narchitecture.\n\n**Figure 2 – Recommended Network Architecture**\n\n**9.** **Security efforts focused solely on corporate internet interface point.**\nWhen the IT organization assumes that if the corporate network is protected\nthen the rest of the control system is protected it leaves the process control\n\n\n-----\n\nnetwork open for attack. Some of the best and most secure networks have\nbeen compromised by an employee bringing in a laptop w/an embedded\nTrojan or Worm, connecting to the production network and introducing the\nmalicious code. Therefore, practicing defense in depth is an essential\ncybersecurity practice.\n\n**8.** **Remote access to the process control LAN not properly secured. Many**\ncontrol systems have modems or wireless access. These communication\npoints need to be secured with, for example, encryption or passwords.\nEquipment vendors frequently leave open ports for remote maintenance of\nequipment.\n\n**7.** **Dual-Network cards installed and in use, bridging the two networks. If a**\nsingle computer has direct access to both the corporate and process control\nnetworks through separate network cards, a hacker can bypass the firewall.\nThis can include remote communications when the remote user connects\nthrough a commercial ISP service.\n\n**6.** **Null-Session Authentication, shared folders, and “everyone” permissions**\n**defeat any internal IT controls. Everyone needs to be trained on good**\ncybersecurity practices. These commonly found security “no-no’s” are\nprimarily used for exploiting a system once access is gained. The fewer\ninternal access controls are in place the easier it is for a successful penetration\nto turn into a successful exploitation.\n\n**5.** **Process LAN and associated systems easy to find by obvious PC name. If**\na hacker can make it into the process control network, it only makes life easier\nfor them if they can easily recognize the names of the equipment,\ninstrumentation and controllers. There are many instances of people making\nlife easier by naming their systems with critical information, i.e., Firewall1,\nPrimary DNS, Historian or History1.\n\n**4.** **No outbound filtering of data. Data needs to be filtered as it exits the**\nprocess control network as well as filtering the data stream as it enters. The\nonly way to know what is being transferred into and out of your network is to\nlook at the data. Know which systems should be talking to which systems and\nlook for anomalies.\n\n**3.** **Workstations / Servers running process control applications not properly**\n**patched. Nearly every critical exploit for the past several years has had an**\nexisting patch. Patches are created by the vendor to make their system work\nbetter and operate more securely. Keep your anti-virus software updated, too.\nPatching in control systems is not easy. We must test, retest and then\ncarefully examine both the need and the net gain. If equal protection or\nmitigation can be gained another way for the short term then use it while you\nplan and patch.\n\n\n-----\n\n**2.** **Policies either not in place, not followed, inadequate or not enforced**\n**(password, backup/restore, etc…). Event the best training program and the**\nbest network architecture will be defeated if the company policies are\ninadequate or not enforced. Passwords have been found taped to the system,\nunder the keyboard, in a file on the system named “Passwords” or “psswd”\nand even shared with coworkers.\n\n**1.** **Social engineering (i.e., human factors) and physical security extremely**\n**weak. Your friendly industrial espionage agent will tell you that a few secrets**\nlearned through social engineering or by gaining access to the network system\nwill make the hackers’ job infinitely easier. An effective counterintelligence\nor Operations Security program and strict adherence to policies and\nprocedures are essential.\n\n### 3. CONCLUSION\n\nCybersecurity is critical to success in today’s business world. It helps defend against\ncyber attack on control systems for both the casual and the malicious intruder as well as\nindustrial espionage. Cyber attacks are a reality in today’s world, and critical\ninfrastructures are increasingly the target. The number of cyber incidences and the\nsophistication of the attacks have dramatically increased. Companies can defend\nthemselves against these attacks by reducing their process control network vulnerabilities\nand following good security practices and procedures. Critical infrastructures, such as\nthe chemical industry, need to be proactive and protect their assets from potential cyber\nattacks and to ensure the safety of workers, the public and our environment.\n\n### 4.
