Zebrocy is mainly used against governments and commercial](https://analyze.intezer.com/families/2196bcb4-94b0-4773-beb6-87900b338521)\norganizations engaged in foreign affairs. The lures consisted of documents about\nSinopharm International Corporation—a pharmaceutical company that COVID-19\nvaccine is currently going through phase three clinical trials—and an impersonated\nevacuation letter from Directorate General of Civil Aviation.\n\nThe lure was delivered as part of a Virtual Hard Drive (VHD) file that requires victims to\nuse Windows 10 to access the files. While the malware samples were heavily obfuscated,\n[it was possible to attribute them to the Sofacy threat actor since they shared](https://analyze.intezer.com/families/4b0df7b0-b079-4a21-a72d-a35efabef6d8)\ngenomes with samples used in previous campaigns.\n\nIt appears that the threat actor switched from delivering VHD files with the\nDelphi version of Zebrocy, to the Go version in the middle of November. Given that\nmany COVID-19 vaccines are about to be approved for clinical use, it’s likely that APTs\n\n\n-----\n\n(Advanced Persistent Threat) and financially motivated threat actors will use this\nmalware in their attacks.\n\n## Zebrocy Evolution\n\n[Zebrocy is a malware used by the threat group Sofacy, also known as Sednit, APT28,](https://analyze.intezer.com/families/2196bcb4-94b0-4773-beb6-87900b338521)\n[Fancy Bear, and STRONTIUM. Sofacy was one of the groups indicted by the Department](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/grand-jury-indicts-12-russian-intelligence-officers-hacking-offenses-related-2016-election)\nof Justice (DOJ) for the compromise of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The\nZebrocy toolset was first reported by Kaspersky Labs as part of theirAPT Trends\n[report in 2017. The malware was first used in2015 and overlapped with known Sofacy](https://securelist.com/zebrocys-multilanguage-malware-salad/90680/)\ninfrastructure at the time. Zebrocy operates as a downloader and collects information\nabout the infected host that is uploaded to the command and control (C&C) server\nbefore downloading and executing the next stage.\n\nThe first version of the downloader was written in Delphi and was based on aprevious\nmalware used by Sofacy. One unique aspect of the operators behind Zebrocy is their\nchoice of evolving the malware. Instead of improving their codebase to add new\nfunctionalities and increase their chance of staying undetected, the group has opted to\nkeep the malware simple by implementing new versions in different programming\nlanguages. Zebrocy samples written in AutoIT, C++, C#, Delphi, Go, and VB.NET have\n[been discovered by the research community.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-sofacy-groups-parallel-attacks/)\n\nWhile Zebrocy is known to be used by a subset of the Sofacy threat group, Kaspersky\n[Labs reported in January 2019 that they had discovered infrastructure used both by](https://securelist.com/greyenergys-overlap-with-zebrocy/89506/)\nZebrocy and GreyEnergy. GreyEnergy was discovered by ESET and reported on\n[inOctober 2018. The group is believed to be the successor of BlackEnergy, also known as](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ESET_GreyEnergy.pdf)\nSandworm. Sandworm was recently attributed to Russia’s GRU by the United States\n[government in an indictment for the NotPetya and Olympic Destroyer campaigns.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/six-russian-gru-officers-charged-connection-worldwide-deployment-destructive-malware-and)\nGenerally speaking, Sofacy and BlackEnergy have diverging goals and have been known\nto go after different targets. In this case, the common infrastructure and targets between\nthe Sofacy subgroup using Zebrocy and GreyEnergy suggests a relationship between the\ngroups.\n\n[Zebrocy is mainly used againstgovernments and commercial organizations engaged](https://securelist.com/masha-and-these-bears/84311/)\n[inforeign affairs. Victims have been locatedin: “Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-sofacy-groups-parallel-attacks)\nHerzegovina, China, Egypt, Georgia, Iran, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Kyrgyzstan,\nMongolia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan,\nUkraine, Uruguay, and Zimbabwe.” The delivery of Zebrocy is usually via a spear[phishingemail. The email has contained Microsoft Office documents or archive files.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/24/sednit-update-analysis-zebrocy/)\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nAt the end of November, we discovered a Virtual Hard Drive (VHD) file\n(a7b446d79d3fc05a7e1881d6d4abaf55) named 30-22-243.vhd that was uploaded from\nAzerbaijan to VirusTotal. VHD is the native file format for virtual hard drives used by\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft’s hypervisor, Hyper-V. Windows 10 has native support for the file format and\nallows the user to mount the file and access its content. Figure 1 shows what the user\nwould see if they downloaded the file to their desktop. According to timestamps stored\nin the file, the disk was created on November 20, 2020, 10 days before it was uploaded\nto VirusTotal.\n\n_Figure 1: VHD phishing lure._\n\nIf the user double-clicks on the file, Windows will mount the drive and\nit appears as an external hard drive. Figure 2 shows the content of the\nVHD.\n\n_Figure 2: Content of the VHD file. It contains two files: A PDF file and an executable_\n_that is masquerading as a Microsoft Word document._\n\nThe VHD file includes two files, a PDF document and an executable that is\nmasquerading as a Microsoft Word document. The PDF file consists of presentation\nslides about Sinopharm International Corporation. Figure 3 displays a screenshot of the\nfirst slide.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: PDF of presentation slides used as part of the lure._\n\nSinopharm International Corporation is a China-based manufacturer of pharmaceutical\nproducts. It is one of the companies in China that is currently working on a vaccine for\n[COVID-19. Their vaccine is currently undergoingphase three clinical trials but it has](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-coronavirus-drug-vaccine-status/)\n[already beengiven to nearly one million people. It may not come as a surprise that the](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-vaccine-sinopharm/china-sinopharms-coronavirus-vaccine-taken-by-about-a-million-people-in-emergency-use-idUKKBN27Z0PS)\nthreat group behind Zebrocy is using COVID-19-themed related lures when many\nvaccines are about to get approved for use. The group is known to usecurrent events as\npart of their phishing lures.\n\nThe second file is the malware. By default, Windows hides known file extensions and the\nuser can be easily tricked into believing that it’s a Word document. The scan results of\n[the executable from VirusTotal is shown in Figure 4 and Intezer Analyze in Figure 5.](https://analyze.intezer.com/)\nOnly nine of the 70 antivirus engines detected the file as generic malware while Analyze\ndetected the file as malware associated with Sofacy.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: VirusTotal scan results of the binary file with generic detection._\n\n_Figure 5: Intezer Analyze detects the file as genetically similar to malware used by_\n_Sofacy one year ago._\nThe malware is a new sample of Zebrocy written in Go. Earlier this year,\n[QuoIntelligence detected an ongoing campaign by Sofacy, assessing with medium-high](https://quointelligence.eu/2020/09/apt28-zebrocy-malware-campaign-nato-theme/)\nconfidence that the group was targeting Azerbaijan. In that campaign, the Delphi version\nwas used. It appears that the threat group has now switched from delivering the Delphi\ndownloader to the Go downloader.\n\nThe downloader is similar to the original downloader reported byPalo Alto Networks\n[Unit 42. The sample has been obfuscated with gobfuscator, the same tool used by the](https://github.com/unixpickle/gobfuscate)\n[Blackrota malware. The sample doesn’t collect the same amount of information about](https://blog.netlab.360.com/blackrota-an-obfuscated-backdoor-written-in-go-en/)\nthe infected machine (i.e., running processes, local disk information, and system\ninformation from “systeminfo”) as in previous campaigns. Instead, it collects the\nhostname and the path to the user’s TEMP folder. This information is used to generate\nan identifier by hashing the values with MD5. The screenshot functionality is not\nperformed by an imported third-party library. Rather, the malware author has included\nthe screenshot code from the library directly in the main codebase. The malware has\n\n\n-----\n\nsome anti-debugging checks. In Figure 6, it can be seen how the malware calls the\nWindows API function IsDebuggerPresent. If true is returned, it enters an infinite\nsleeping loop.\n\n_Figure 6: Logic that checks if the process is being debugged. If true, it enters a sleeping_\n_loop._\n\nThe screenshot is uploaded to the C&C located at the URL: hxxps://support**cloud[.]life/managment/cb-secure/technology.php. If the C&C returns a second**\nstage, the file is written to the disk and executed. The URL scheme for the C&C is similar\n[to the URL scheme used in the originalGo version (hxxp://89.37.226[.]148/technet-](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/sofacy-creates-new-go-variant-of-zebrocy-tool/)\n**support/library/online-service-description.php). The domain name was**\nregistered with NameCheap on October 20, 2020, and uses a certificate issued by Let’s\nEncrypt. The certificate was issued on November 2, 2020. The infrastructure is hosted\non 80.90.39.24 which is owned by the Luxembourg-based hosting company, Visual\nOnline. The infrastructure appears to be new.\n\n## Earlier Campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing the icon resource from the original phishing lure, we found another phishing lure\n(395e166af5197967503f45c3ac134ff7) that was uploaded to VirusTotal from Kazakhstan\non November 12. This VHD file was named No.243.CB3-EVACUATION\n**LETTER.vhd. The content of the file is shown in Figure 7.**\n\n_Figure 7: Content of No.243.CB3-EVACUATION LETTER.vhd. The disk file includes an_\n_executable file and a PDF file._\n\nThe executable is another Go version of Zebrocy. It uses the same C&C URL. The sample\nis obfuscated using the same technique the group has used for their prior versions. The\nfunction names have been mangled and the strings have been obfuscated. In this\nversion, the strings are obfuscated by rotating the characters in the string one step. For\nexample, A has been rotated to B.\n\n[The PDF file is corrupted. This is not the first time the group is usingcorrupt files as part](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/11/20/sednit-whats-going-zebrocy/)\n[of its lures. CorruptMicrosoft Excel files were used in the campaign uncovered by](https://quointelligence.eu/2020/09/apt28-zebrocy-malware-campaign-nato-theme/)\nQuoIntelligence earlier this year. The technique is likely used to trick the user into\nexecuting the application rather than just viewing the lure.\n\nBased on the file name, one theory we have is a message from India’s Directorate\n[General of Civil Aviation is being impersonated. It was announced in August that a flight](https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/will-develop-flight-network-to-russia-central-asian-countries-in-next-few-months-indigo-official/1920413)\nnetwork between India, Russia, and other Central Asian countries was being developed.\nWhile India has suspended international flights due to the pandemic, some airlines have\noperated charter flights to “Russia, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.”\n\nIt turns out the same VHD file was uploaded in October to VirusTotal with different\ncontent (855005fee45e71c36a466527c7fad62f); both samples share the same disk ID.\nThe content of this sample is shown in Figure 8. As with the other VHD files, this also\n\n\n-----\n\nhas a PDF file and an executable masquerading as a Microsoft Word Document. Instead\nof delivering the Go version of Zebrocy, the Delphi loader was used.\n\n_Figure 8: Content of VHD uploaded to VirusTotal in October._\n\nThe PDF lure is written in Russian. The title is, according to Google Translate:\n“NATIONAL LIST INDIVIDUALS AND LEGAL ENTITIES INVOLVED IN TERRORIST\nAND EXTREMIST ACTIVITIES OR THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEAPONS OF MASS\nDESTRUCTION.” The content of the first page is shown in Figure 9.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: Redacted screenshot of PDF lure written in Russian._\n\nAccording to timestamps, the VHD was created on October 21, the day after the domain\n(support-cloud[.]life) was registered. The domain was used in a spear-phishing attack\nagainst a Kazakhstan government ministry the same day. The VHD file was uploaded to\nVirusTotal the next day. On November 11, the same VHD file was reused but the lure and\npayload were changed. This version of the VHD was uploaded to VirusTotal the next day.\nBy applying this logic to the VHD file used to deliver the Sinopharm-based lure, we can\nestimate that it was used around November 20.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nZebrocy is a malware toolset used by the Sofacy threat group. While the group keeps\nchanging obfuscation and delivery techniques, code reuse allowed Intezer to detect and\ncorrectly classify this malware. With these recent phishing lures, it’s clear that COVID-19\nthemed attacks are still a threat and we might see more as vaccines become available to\nthe general public.\n\nIt’s important that companies use defense-in-depth strategies to protect against threats.\nEmployers should also ensure employees are trained on detecting and reacting to\nphishing attempts. Phishing attempts do not always originate from an external email\naddress; they can also come from a compromised account within the enterprise.\n\n## IoCs\n\n Network\n\nhxxps://support-cloud[.]life/managment/cb-secure/technology.php\n\n## VHD files\n\nd5d9210ef49c6780016536b0863cc50f6de03f73e70c2af46cc3cff0e2bf9353 301868.vhd\n43c65d87d690aea7c515fe84317af40b7e64b350304b0fc958a51d62826feade 3022-243.vhd\nd444fde5885ec1241041d04b3001be17162523d2058ab1a7f88aac50a6059bc0\nNo.243.CB3-EVACUATION LETTER.vhd\n\n## Zebrocy\n\nf36a0ee7f4ec23765bb28fbfa734e402042278864e246a54b8c4db6f58275662\n243_BIO_SINOPHARM.exe\n61c2e524dcc25a59d7f2fe7eff269865a3ed14d6b40e4fea33b3cd3f58c14f19\n243.CB3.EVACUATION LETTER.exe\n\n\n-----\n\n6449d0cb1396d6feba7fb9e25fb20e9a0a5ef3e8623332844458d73057cf04a1 301868 20.10.2020.exe\n\n**Joakim Kennedy**\nDr. Joakim Kennedy is a Security Researcher analyzing malware and tracking threat\nactors on a daily basis.
