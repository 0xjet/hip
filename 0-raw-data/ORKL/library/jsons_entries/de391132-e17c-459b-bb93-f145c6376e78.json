After\n[investigation, it became clear that this newcomer is derived from the code of the Xerxes banking malware, which itself is a strain of the LokiBot](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/lokibot_the_first_hybrid_android_malware.html)\nAndroid banking Trojan. The source code of the Xerxes malware was made public by its author around May 2019, which means that it is\naccessible to any threat actor.\n\nWhen source code of malware is leaked or made publicly accessible it is pretty common to see the threat landscape being supplemented with\nnew malware variants or families based on the said code. We have observed similar events in the past, as for example the infamous Bankbot\n[Trojan code made available by its author, leading to new Trojans like CometBot, Razdel and Anubis. When Anubis itself was leaked the](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/anubis_2_malware_and_afterlife.html)\n[actor(s) behind the Ginp Trojan reused small portions of its code.](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/ginp_a_malware_patchwork_borrowing_from_anubis.html)\n\nHowever, when Xerxes’ source code was leaked, no new malware based on, or using portions of, such code was observed. BlackRock seems\nto be the only Android banking Trojan based on the source code of the Trojan at the moment.\n\nAlthough LokiBot has been considered dead and inactive for a while, we have observed attempts from some actors to get the Trojan working\nseveral times in the last years. Looking at the number of samples built for each of those campaigns and the duration of those, the actors didn’t\nseem to have been very successful. Therefore, we believe that those campaigns were probably driven by new actors trying out the publicly\navailable source code. BlackRock campaigns - on the other hand - are not alike, not only did the Trojan undergo changes in its code, but also\ncomes with an increased target list (containing many non-financial apps) and have been ongoing for a longer period.\n\nTechnical aspects aside, one of the interesting differentiators of BlackRock is its target list; it contains an important number of social,\nnetworking, communication and dating applications. So far, many of those applications haven’t been observed in target lists for other existing\nbanking Trojans. It therefore seems that the actors behind BlackRock are trying to abuse the grow in online socializing that increased rapidly in\nthe last months due to the pandemic situation.\n\n## The LokiBot malware family\n\nAs BlackRock is based on the Xerxes banking Trojan, it is part of the LokiBot descendance which has several variants, as shown hereafter.\n\nLokiBot itself was first observed between end 2016 and beginning 2017 as rented malware. Sometime after the author of the Trojan got\n[banned from underground forums, the source code of the Trojan was leaked. During first half of 2018 MysteryBot was observed to be active.](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/mysterybot__a_new_android_banking_trojan_ready_for_android_7_and_8.html)\nAlthough it was based on LokiBot it contained upgrades in order to work properly on newer Android versions and used new techniques to steal\npersonal information In the second half of 2018 Parasite appeared on the threat landscape as direct successor of MysteryBot It was\n\n\n-----\n\ne a ced t access b ty eatu es a d so e auto ated sc pts (suc as ay a auto ated t a s e sc pts) ay 0 9 t e e es oja\nfirst appeared, it was based on Parasite and after some unsuccessful attempts in offering the Trojan in underground forums, the actor made it\npublicly available. After being used by several actors, it faded away from the threat landscape. In May 2020 BlackRock was first spotted.\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen the malware is first launched on the device, it will start by hiding its icon from the app drawer, making it invisible to the end-user. As\nsecond step it asks the victim for the Accessibility Service privileges. As visible in following screenshot, the Trojan’s largest campaigns are\nposing as fake Google updates:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nOnce the user grants the requested Accessibility Service privilege, BlackRock starts by granting itself additional permissions. Those additional\npermissions are required for the bot to fully function without having to interact any further with the victim. When done, the bot is functional and\nready to receive commands from the C2 server and perform the overlay attacks\n\n\n-----\n\n## Commands\n\nThe commands supported by the actual version of the bot are listed below. It gives a good overview of what the actor(s) can do on the infected\ndevice.\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\nSend_SMS Sends an SMS\n\nFlood_SMS Sends an SMS to a specific number every 5 seconds\n\nDownload_SMS Sends a copy of SMS messages to C2\n\nSpam_on_contacts Sends an SMS to each of the contacts present on the infected device\n\nChange_SMS_Manager Set malware as default SMS manager (command is repeated every 30 seconds until action is achieved)\n\nRun_App Starts a specific app on the bot\n\nStartKeyLogs Logs text content shown on the screen from targets and sends it to the C2\n\nStopKeyLogs Stops logging the accessibility events from targets\n\nStartPush Send a copy of all notifications content to the C2\n\nStopPush Stops sending a copy of all notifications content to the C2\n\nHide_Screen_Lock Keeps the device on the HOME screen\n\nUnlock_Hide_Screen Unlocks the device from the HOME screen\n\nAdmin Makes the both request admin privileges\n\nProfile Adds a managed admin profile for the malware on the device\n\nStart_clean_Push Dismisses (hiding) all push notifications\n\nStop_clean_Push Stops dismissing push notifications\n\n## Features\n\nBlackRock offers a quite common set of capabilities compared to average Android banking Trojans. It can perform the infamous overlay\nattacks, send, spam and steal SMS messages, lock the victim in the launcher activity (HOME screen of the device), steal and hide\nnotifications, deflect usage of Antivirus software on the device and act as a keylogger. Interestingly, the Xerxes Trojan itself offers more\nfeatures, but it seems that actors have removed some of them in order to only keep those that they consider useful to steal personal\ninformation.\n\nThe keylogger logs the text content from apps shown on the screen and will do so for applications included in the targets lists only.\n\nThe Trojan will redirect the victim to the HOME screen of the device if the victims tries to start or use antivirus software as per a specific list\nincluding Avast, AVG, BitDefender, Eset, Symantec, TrendMicro, Kaspersky, McAfee, Avira, and even applications to clean Android devices,\nsuch as TotalCommander, SD Maid or Superb Cleaner. By doing so, the Trojan tries to avoid letting the victim remove it from the device and\nestablish some form of persistency.\n\nBlackRock embeds following set of features, allowing it to remain under the radar and successfully harvest personal information:\n\nOverlaying: Dynamic (Local injects obtained from C2)\nKeylogging\nSMS harvesting: SMS listing\nSMS harvesting: SMS forwarding\nDevice info collection\nSMS: Sending\nRemote actions: Screen-locking\nSelf-protection: Hiding the App icon\nSelf-protection: Preventing removal\nNotifications collection\nGrant permissions\nAV detection\n\n## Profiling\n\n\n-----\n\nO e u ct o a ty t at s so a u que to ac oc s t at t a es usage o t e d o d o p o es s d o d eatu e s usua y used by\ncompanies to define a device policy controller (DPC) in order to control and apply policies on their mobile fleet. It allows to control various\naspects of a device without per se having complete administration rights on all aspects of the device.\n\nBlackRock abuses this feature to gain admin privileges. It simply creates and attributes itself a profile which has the admin privileges.\n\nThe following code snippet show how the profile is created:\n```\nprivate void createProfile() {\n  try {\n    Intent intent = new Intent(\"android.app.action.PROVISION\\_MANAGED\\_PROFILE\");\n    if(Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < 23) {\n      intent.putExtra(\"android.app.extra.\", this.getApplicationContext().getPackageName());\n    }\n    else {\n      intent.putExtra(\"android.app.extra.PROVISIONING\\_DEVICE\\_ADMIN\\_COMPONENT\\_NAME\", new ComponentName(this,\nAdmins.class.getName()));\n    }\n    if(intent.resolveActivity(this.getPackageManager()) != null) {\n      this.startActivityForResult(intent, 101);\n      return;\n    }\n  }\n  catch(Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n    return;\n  }\n}\n\n## Overlay attack\n\n```\nBlackRock abuses the Accessibility Service to check which application runs in the foreground. Like the Ginp Android banking Trojan,\nBlackRock has two types of overlay screens, one is a generic card grabber view and the other is specific per targeted app - credential phishing\noverlay. Both target lists can be found in the appendix of this blog.\n\nThe following code snippet shows how the overlay WebView is created:\n```\nprotected void onStart() {\n  super.onStart();\n  SharedPreferences.Editor editor = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this).edit();\n  editor.putBoolean(\"injActive\", true);\n  editor.commit();\n  String packageName = this.getIntent().getStringExtra(\"str\");\n  String injURL = this.getFilesDir().getAbsolutePath() + File.separator;\n  try {\n    this.webView = new WebView(this);\n    this.webView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);\n    this.webView.setScrollBarStyle(0);\n    this.webView.setWebChromeClient(new WebChromeClient());\n    this.webView.addJavascriptInterface(new JSInterface(this, packageName), \"Android\");\n    this.webView.setWebViewClient(new Inject.a(this));\n    this.webView.loadUrl(\"file:///\" + injURL + packageName + \"/index.html\");\n    this.setContentView(this.webView);\n    this.webView.setWebViewClient(new Inject.b(this, packageName));\n  }\n  catch(Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n  }\n}\n\n```\nAs shown in the previous code snippet, the URL of the overlay points to local files rather than a web location. This is a feature that is inherited\nfrom Xerxes, which downloads an archive with all the targets overlays files on the infected device. BlackRock does it somehow differently by\ndownloading a separate archive for each targeted app installed on the device.\n\nFollowing screenshots show some of the credential phishing overlays:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFollowing screenshot shows the generic card grabber overlay:\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, of the 337 unique applications in BlackRock’s target lists, many applications haven’t been observed to be targeted by banking\nmalware before. Those “new” targets are mostly not related to financial institutions and are overlayed in order to steal credit card details. As\nshown in the following chart, most of the non-financial apps are Social, Communication, Lifestyle and Dating apps. Most of the trending social\nand dating apps are included, the actors’ choice might have been driven by the pandemic situation, pushing people to socialized more online.\nIt also seems that actors have made a particular effort on including dating apps, which wasn’t something common in targets list so far.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen it comes to the targets of the credential-stealing overlays, the majority of the most targeted apps are related to banks operating in\nEurope, followed by Australia, the United States of America and Canada. But financial apps are not the only ones included in the list; shopping,\ncommunication and business apps seem to have a certain interest for the actors. Among others, we found some applications related to\nGerman online car selling services, Polish online shopping sites and well-known email services. The following chart shows the ratio of targeted\napps per app category.\n\nAs visible in following chart, the BlackRock Trojan’s target list includes applications operating in a variety of different countries. The chart\nshows the number of occurrences of financial apps per countries of operation for all BlackRock samples observed so far.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAlthough we’ve observed a steady increase in the number of new banking Trojans since 2014, 2020 shows an interesting increase again after\n[a quite calm 2019. As stated in our blog 2020 - Year of the RAT not only are there more new Android banking Trojans, but some of them also](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/2020_year_of_the_rat.html)\nbring innovative new features. Most of them start embedding features, allowing the criminals to take remote control of the infected device\n\n\n-----\n\n( ) a d so et es e e to auto at ca y pe o t e aud o t e ected de ce ( S) t e case o ac oc, t e eatu es a e ot\nvery innovative but the target list has a large international coverage and it contains quite a lot of new targets which haven’t been seen being\ntargeted before.\n\nAlthough BlackRock poses a new Trojan with an exhaustive target list, looking at previous unsuccessful attempts of actors to revive LokiBot\nthrough new variants, we can’t yet predict how long BlackRock will be active on the threat landscape. What can be considered as true is that\nthe number of new banking Trojans will continue to grow, bringing new functionalities to increase the success rate of fraud while fraud\nbecomes a growing risk even for consumers not using mobile banking - as we can see with BlackRock targeting 3rd party apps.\n\nThe second half of 2020 will come with its surprises, after Alien, Eventbot and BlackRock we can expect that financially motivated threat actors\nwill build new banking Trojans and continue improving the existing ones. With the changes that we expect to be made to mobile banking\nTrojans, the line between banking malware and spyware becomes thinner, banking malware will pose a threat for more organizations and their\ninfrastructure, an organic change that we observed on windows banking malware years ago.\n\nThe most important aspect to take care of is securing the online banking channels, making fraud hard to perform, therefore discouraging\ncriminals to make more malware.\n\n## Mobile Threat Intelligence\n\nOur threat intelligence solution – MTI, provides the context and in-depth knowledge of the past and present malware-powered threats in order\nto understand the future of the threat landscape. Such intelligence, includes both the strategic overview on trends and the operational\nindicators to discern early signals of upcoming threats and build a future-proof security strategy.\n\n## Client Side Detection\n\nOur online fraud detection solution – CSD, presents financial institutions with the real-time overview on the risk status of their online channels\nand related devices. This overview provides all the relevant information and context to act upon threats before they turn into fraud. The\nconnectivity with existing risk or fraud engines allows for automated and orchestrated, round the clock fraud mitigation.\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Samples\n\nSome of the latest BlackRock samples found in the wild:\n\n**App**\n**name** **Package name** **SHA-256 hash**\n\n\nGoogle\nUpdate\n\nGoogle\nUpdate\n\nGoogle\nUpdate\n\nGoogle\nUpdate\n\nGoogle\nUpdate\n\n\nayxzygxgagiqhdnjnfduerzbeh.hme.egybgkeziplb 51f9c37c3eec0b6f8325aa1c8fe64a0615ab920584042df557426473b1\n\ncmbmpqod.bfrtuduawoyhr.mlmrncmjbdecuc 6fa4baef8a811f429cee4b383d7a4776b7b363b62551c8d8e0f93bad33\n\nfpjwhqsl.dzpycoeasyhs.cwnporwocambskrxcxiug 7d34aaf84754fb247507681bcd821f9533f24c6d78aa6779a11f4d789d4\n\nonpekpikylb.bcgdhxgzwd.dzlecjglpigjuc 81fda9ff99aec1b6f7b328652e330d304fb18ee74e0dbd0b759acb24e75\n\nezmjhdiumgiyhfjdp.bjucshsqxhkigwyqqma.gqncehdcknrtcekingi fbaf785edfafa583ea61884d88f507a27154892a394e27d81102f79fe7e\n\n\n### Credential theft target list\n\nThe actual BlacRock target list used for credential theft contains 226 applications:\n\n**App name** **Package name**\n\nTransferWise Money Transfer com.transferwise.android\n\nPayPal Mobile Cash: Send and Request Money Fast com.paypal.android.p2pmobile\n\nPayoneer – Global Payments Platform for Businesses com.payoneer.android\n\nNETELLER - fast, secure and global money transfers com.moneybookers.skrillpayments.neteller\n\nEO.Finance: Buy and Sell Bitcoin.
