    "plain_text": "# Quarterly report: Incident Response trends in Summer 2020\n\n**[blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/06/CTIR-trends-q3-2020.html](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/06/CTIR-trends-q3-2020.html#more)**\n\n_By_ _[David Liebenberg and](https://twitter.com/chinahanddave?lang=en)_ _[Caitlin Huey.](https://twitter.com/hueylittle_er)_\n\nFor the fourth quarter in a row, Ryuk dominated the threat landscape in incident response.\nAs we mentioned in last quarter’s [report, Ryuk has shifted from relying on commodity trojans](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/04/IR-quarterly-threat-report-spring-2020.html)\nto using living-off-the-land tools. This has led to a decrease in observations of attacks\n\n\n-----\n\nleveraging commodity trojans. Email remained the top infection vector, though we observe\nincreased compromises of remote desktop services (RDS) as well as Citrix devices and\nPulse VPN. One of the more interesting trends this quarter was the role of the COVID-19\npandemic. Interestingly, we did not observe any engagements in which COVID-19 was used\nin an attack. However, CTIR has observed the pandemic impacting organizations, affecting\ntheir ability to respond and contain cybersecurity incidents.\n\n[For additional information, you can also check out our full summary here.](https://talos-intelligence-site.s3.amazonaws.com/production/document_files/files/000/092/612/original/032720__Q3_2020_one_pager.pdf)\n\n## Targeting\n\nA wide variety of verticals were once again targeted, including energy and utilities, financial\nservices, government, health care, industrial distribution, manufacturing, retail, technology,\ntelecommunications, and transportation. The top targeted verticals were health care and\ntechnology, a change from last quarter when the top targeted verticals were financial\nservices and government.\n\n## Threats\n\nRansomware continued to comprise the majority of threats CTIR observed. As mentioned\nabove, contrary to previous quarters, CTIR is observing fewer engagements in which Emotet\nand Trickbot function as the initial dropper for Ryuk. This is one reason why we observed far\nfewer attacks leveraging commodity trojans this quarter. As mentioned last quarter, Ryuk\nattacks evolved in other ways as well, leveraging encoded PowerShell commands to\ndownload the initial payload, disable security/AV tools, stop backups, and scan the entire\nnetwork and provide an output of online vs. offline hosts. Ryuk adversaries are using more\nWindows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and BitsAdmin to deploy the malware in\naddition to PsExec.\n\nFor example, a government organization had thousands of systems encrypted with Ryuk\nransomware, affecting nearly 2,000 systems and critical services. There was no evidence of\nany presence of commodity trojans during the attack. The adversaries compromised a\ndomain administrator account by recovering the password stored in a Group Policy. The\nadversaries attempted to prevent file restoration by using bcdedit to alter boot configuration\ndata to prevent system recovery, deleted Windows shadow copies, and used vssadmin to\nremove system restore points. The adversaries then tried to expand the number of affected\nhosts by granting full permission for all users for all files on all mounted disk drives with\nicacls.exe. They also sent Wake-On-Lan magic packets to wake shut-down hosts for\nencryption.\n\nThe adversaries used PowerShell to disable real-time monitoring malware protection and a\nPowerShell cmdlet code “Get-DataInfo.ps1” to scan the network and provide an output of live\nor dead hosts in text files. The adversaries used the command-line tool BitsAdmin, as well as\n\n\n-----\n\nWMIC and PsExec with privileged account credentials to copy Ryuk to additional hosts.\n\nIn another engagement where CTIR identified a Ryuk infection, the initial compromise was\nperformed with a phishing email that contained an encrypted Microsoft Word document. The\nmalicious code had been embedded in a chess game written in VBA, and once the\ndocument was opened, it created a VBS file and executed it through PowerShell. The VBS\nfile downloaded and executed the malicious payload identified as Detplock, a remote access\ntrojan (RAT).\n\nCTIR continued to observe ransomware actors exfiltrating sensitive data as another lever to\nfurther compel victims to pay the ransom. This is a continuation of a trend since Winter 2019.\n\n## Initial vectors\n\nFor the majority of engagements, definitively identifying an initial vector was difficult due to\nshortfalls in logging. However, in engagements in which the initial vector could be identified,\nor reasonably assumed, phishing remained the top infection vector. CTIR also observed\nseveral instances in which adversaries leveraged brute-force attacks against a victim\norganization’s RDS. These types of attacks may be related to the increased threat surface\ndue to remote work stemming from COVID-19 as well as an increase in Phobos ransomware\nattacks, which typically leverage compromised RDS connections as an initial vector. CTIR\nalso continued to observe multiple compromises of Citrix Application Discovery Controller\n[and Citrix Gateway (CVE-2019-19781) and Pulse Secure VPN (CVE-2019-11510).](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267027)\n\n## COVID-19\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, CTIR has not observed any engagements in which COVID-19 was\nleveraged, despite the fact that threat actors have been increasingly using COVID-19-related\ninformation as lures in phishing and malspam attacks. However, CTIR has observed the\npandemic impacting organizations, particularly in the health care industry, affecting their\nability to respond and contain cybersecurity incidents since pre-COVID-19 incident response\nplanning did not account for a pandemic occurring along with a parallel cybersecurity\nincident. Limitations in travel, personnel, and budget all contributed to increased difficulty\nmitigating incidents, which was observed across multiple incident response engagements in\nSummer 2020. Additionally, CTIR has observed organizations updating their internal IR and\nbusiness continuity planning in response to the pandemic. This illustrates the importance of\ndeveloping a robust incident response plan and maintaining flexibility to make adjustments in\nresponse to major global events. Despite a lack of COVID-19-themed campaigns, the\npandemic has still increased the threat surface, with an obvious uptick in both RDS and VPN\nservices due to increased remote work. Beyond providing new avenues for adversaries to\ntarget, CTIR has also responded by working with victim organizations in identifying the new\nnetwork “baseline” caused by these changes.\n\n\n-----",
