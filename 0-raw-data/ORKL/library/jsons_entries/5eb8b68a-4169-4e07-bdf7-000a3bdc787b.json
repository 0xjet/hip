    "plain_text": "# Operation Groundbait: Espionage in Ukrainian war zones\n\n**welivesecurity.com/2016/05/18/groundbait**\n\nMay 18, 2016\n\nAfter BlackEnergy and Operation Potao Express, ESET researchers have uncovered\nanother cyberespionage operation in Ukraine: Operation Groundbait.\n\nIn addition to the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine, in recent years the country has been\nfacing a significantly higher number of targeted cyberattacks, or so-called advanced\npersistent threats (APTs).\n\nAfter [BlackEnergy, which has, most infamously, facilitated attacks that resulted in power](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/20/new-wave-attacks-ukrainian-power-industry/)\n[outages for hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian civilians, and Operation Potao Express,](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/07/30/operation-potao-express/)\nwhere attackers went after sensitive TrueCrypt-protected data from high value targets,\nESET researchers have uncovered another cyberespionage operation in Ukraine:\nOperation Groundbait.\n\n## Cyber-surveillance focusing on separatists\n\nThe main point that sets Operation Groundbait apart from the other attacks is that it has\nmostly been targeting anti-government separatists in the self-declared Donetsk and\nLuhansk People’s Republics.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the attackers seem to be more interested in separatists and the self-declared\ngovernments in eastern Ukrainian war zones, there have also been a large number of other\ntargets, including, among others, Ukrainian government officials, politicians and journalists..\n\n## Groundbait?\n\nThese cyberespionage activities have been carried out using a malware family that ESET\ndetects as _[Win32/Prikormka. The malware has until now eluded the attention of anti-](http://virusradar.com/en/Win32_Prikormka/detail)_\nmalware researchers since at least 2008.\n\nThe infection vector for spreading the malware was mostly through spear-phishing emails\n(which is somewhat the norm for targeted attacks). During our research, we have observed\na large number of samples, each with its designated campaign ID, an appealing file name\nto spark the target’s interest, and decoy documents with various themes related to the\n[current Ukrainian geopolitical situation and the war in Donbass.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Donbass)\n\nWe chose the name Groundbait – the translation of the Russian word Prikormka\n(Прикормка) – because of a puzzling theme used in one campaign that stood out among\nthe others, which used themes related to the armed conflict. The malware file name was\nprikormka.exe and it displayed a pricelist of fishing groundbait, a choice of decoy document\nthat we have so far been unable to explain.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 – Decoy document with groundbait pricelist\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the malware features a modular architecture, allowing the\nattackers to expand its functionality and steal various types of sensitive information and files\nfrom the cyber-surveillance targets.\n\nFurther technical details of the malware, as well as additional information on the ongoing\n[cyberespionage operation, can be found in our comprehensive whitepaper.](http://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Operation-Groundbait.pdf)\n\n## So who’s behind it?\n\nAs is usual in the world of cybercrime and APTs, attributing the source of the attack is tricky\nas conclusive evidence is difficult to find. Our research into the attacks has shown that the\nattackers most likely operate from within Ukraine.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhoever they are, based on the types of targets chosen – mostly separatists in the selfdeclared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics – it is probably fair to assume that this\ncyber-surveillance operation is politically motivated.\n\nApart from that, any further attempt at attribution would at this point be speculative. It is\nimportant to note that in addition to separatists, the targets of this campaign include\nUkrainian government officials, politicians and journalists. The possibility of false flags must\nbe considered too.\n\nOur [comprehensive whitepaper includes more information on the Operation Groundbait](http://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Operation-Groundbait.pdf)\n[campaigns and technical details of the Prikormka malware. Indicators of Compromise (IOC)](http://virusradar.com/en/Win32_Prikormka/detail)\n[that can be used to identify an infection can also be found in the whitepaper or on github.](https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/groundbait)\n\nFor any inquiries, or to make sample submissions related to the subject, contact us at:\n[threatintel@eset.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:threatintel@eset.com)\n\n18 May 2016 - 02:30PM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
