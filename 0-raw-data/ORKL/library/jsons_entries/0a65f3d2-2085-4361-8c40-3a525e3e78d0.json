Such activities are\nunacceptable as they seek to threaten our integrity and security, democratic values and\nprinciples and the core functioning of our democracies.\n\nThese malicious cyber activities are targeting numerous members of Parliaments,\ngovernment officials, politicians, and members of the press and civil society in the EU by\naccessing computer systems and personal accounts and stealing data. These activities are\ncontrary to the norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace as endorsed by all UN\nMember States, and attempt to undermine our democratic institutions and processes,\nincluding by enabling disinformation and information manipulation.\n\nThe European Union and its Member States strongly denounce these malicious cyber\nactivities, which all involved must put to an end immediately. We urge the Russian\nFederation to adhere to the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\n\nThe European Union will revert to this issue in upcoming meetings and consider taking\nfurther steps.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Candidate Countries the Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania and)\nthe EFTA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, members of the European Economic\nArea, as well as Ukraine and Georgia align themselves with this declaration.\n\n1)The Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania continue to be part of the\n\nStabilisation and Association Process.\n\n## Press contacts\n\n**[Nabila Massrali](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3957585b5055581754584a4a4b585550795c5a175c4c4b564958175c4c)**\nSpokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy\n\n+32 2 29 88093\n\n+32 460 79 52 44\n\nIf you are not a journalist, please [send your request to the public information service.](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/contact/general-enquiries/)\n\n\n-----",
