    "plain_text": "# Yanluowang: Further Insights on New Ransomware Threat\n\n**[symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/yanluowang-ransomware-attacks-continue](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/yanluowang-ransomware-attacks-continue)**\n\n[Yanluowang, the ransomware recently discovered by Symantec, a division of Broadcom](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/yanluowang-targeted-ransomware)\nSoftware, is now being used by a threat actor that has been mounting targeted attacks\nagainst U.S. corporations since at least August 2021. The attacker uses a number of tools,\ntactics, and procedures (TTPs) that were previously linked to Thieflock ransomware attacks,\nsuggesting that they may have been a Thieflock affiliate who shifted allegiances to the new\nYanluowang ransomware family.\n\nThe attackers have been heavily focused on organizations in the financial sector but have\nalso targeted companies in the manufacturing, IT services, consultancy, and engineering\nsectors.\n\n## Lateral movement\n\nIn most cases, PowerShell is used to download tools to compromised systems including\nBazarLoader to assist in reconnaissance. The attackers then enable RDP via registry to\nenable remote access. After gaining initial access, the attackers usually deploy ConnectWise\n(formerly known as ScreenConnect), a legitimate remote access tool.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to perform lateral movement and identify systems of interest, such as the victim s\nActive Directory server, the attackers deploy Adfind, a free tool that can be used to query\nActive Directory, and SoftPerfect Network Scanner (netscan.exe), a publicly available tool\nused for discovery of hostnames and network services.\n\nThe next phase of the attack is credential theft and the attackers use a wide range of\ncredential-stealing tools, including:\n\nGrabFF: A tool that can dump passwords from Firefox\nGrabChrome: A tool that can dump passwords from Chrome\nBrowserPassView: A tool that can dump passwords from Internet Explorer and a\nnumber of other browsers\n\nAlong with these tools, the attackers also use a number of open-source tools such as\nKeeThief, a PowerShell script to copy the master key from KeePass. In some cases,\ncustomized versions of open-source credential-dumping tools were also observed\n(secretsdump.exe). Credentials were also dumped from the registry.\n\nIn addition, the attackers have also used a number of other data capture tools, including a\nscreen capture tool and a file exfiltration tool (filegrab.exe). Cobalt Strike Beacon was also\ndeployed against at least one targeted organization.\n\nOther tools used include ProxifierPE, which can be used to proxy connections back to\nattacker-controlled infrastructure, and the free, Chromium-based Cent web browser.\n\n## The Thieflock connection\n\nThere is a tentative link between these Yanluowang attacks and older attacks involving\nThieflock, ransomware-as-a-service developed by the Canthroid (aka Fivehands) group.\nSeveral TTPs used by these attackers overlap with TTPs used in Thieflock attacks,\nincluding:\n\nUse of custom password recovery tools such as GrabFF and other open-source\npassword dumping tools\nUse of open-source network scanning tools (SoftPerfect Network Scanner)\nUse of free browsers, such as s3browser and Cent browser\n\nThis link begs the question of whether Yanluowang was developed by Canthroid. However,\nanalysis of Yanluowang and Thieflock does not provide any evidence of shared authorship.\nInstead, the most likely hypothesis is that these Yanluowang attacks may be carried out by a\nformer Thieflock affiliate.\n\n## Protection\n\n\n-----\n\n[For the latest protection updates, please visit the Symantec Protection Bulletin.](https://www.broadcom.com/support/security-center/protection-bulletin)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\na710f573f73c163d54c95b4175706329db3ed89cd9337c583d0bb24b6a384789 – NetScan\n\n2c2513e17a23676495f793584d7165900130ed4e8cccf72d9d20078e27770e04 – Adfind\n\n43f8a66d3f3f1ba574bc932a7bc8e5886fbeeab0b279d1dea654d7119e80a494 – BazarLoader\n\n9aa1f37517458d635eae4f9b43cb4770880ea0ee171e7e4ad155bbdee0cbe732 – Veeamp\n\n85fb8a930fa7f4c32c8af86aa204eb4ea4ae404e670a8be17e7ae0adf37a9e2e – GrabFF\n\ne4942fde1cd7f2fcfb522090fd16298bce247295fe99182aecf7b10be3f5dc53 –\nConnectwiseInstaller\n\nfe38912d64f6d196ac70673cd2edbdbc1a63e494a2d7903546a6d3afa39dc5c4 –\nWmiExecAgent\n\nc77ff8e3804414618abeae394d3003c4bb65a43d69c57c295f443aeb14eaa447 – NetScan\n\n2fc5bf9edcfa19d48e235315e8f571638c99a1220be867e24f3965328fe94a03 – Secretsdump\n\n4ff503258e23d609e0484ee5df70a1db080875272ab6b4db31463d93ebc3c6dd – GrabFile\n\n1c543ea5c50ef8b0b42f835970fa5f553c2ae5c308d2692b51fb476173653cb3 – GrabChrome\n\n0b9219328ebf065db9b26c9a189d72c7d0d9c39eb35e9fd2a5fefa54a7f853e4 –\nOpenChromeDumps\n\nb556d90b30f217d5ef20ebe3f15cce6382c4199e900b5ad2262a751909da1b34 –\nBrowserPassView\n\n5e03cea2e3b875fdbf1c142b269470a9e728bcfba1f13f4644dcc06d10de8fb4 – ConHost\n\n49d828087ca77abc8d3ac2e4719719ca48578b265bbb632a1a7a36560ec47f2d –\nYanluowang\n\nmyeeducationplus.com\n\n185.53.46.115\n\n\n-----",
