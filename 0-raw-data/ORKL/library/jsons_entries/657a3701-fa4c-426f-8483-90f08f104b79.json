This family](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/kuluoz/)\nwas the latest evolution of the Asprox malware and at its peak in 2014 it accounted for 80%\n[of all malware sessions we observed in WildFire. When the team published our Threat](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/technologies/wildfire.html)\nLandscape Review in December of last year, we highlighted this family as a scourge that\nimpacted nearly every company Palo Alto Networks protected in 2014. Kuluoz was primarily\ndistributed through e-mail, which means we saw large numbers of SMTP sessions, but also\ndownloads over a variety of webmail clients.\n\nEven if you didn’t read our blogs, you probably dealt with Kuluoz. Throughout 2014, most of\nthe waves of spam e-mails carrying fake court notices, voicemail messages and package\ndelivery alerts carried a Kuluoz attachment. If you opened these attachments you quickly\nbecame part of the botnet, sending copies of the malware to other victims while the\nbotmaster silently installed additional malicious software on your system.\n\nGiven all of this activity, we were quite surprised when the malware all but disappeared at the\nend of December 2014.\n\nThe screenshot above shows the number of malware sessions per week that we tagged as\n[“Kuluoz” in the AutoFocus service. When we first noticed the drop-off, our suspicion was that](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/platforms/subscriptions/autofocus.html)\nwe were “missing” the new Kuluoz samples. Just weeks earlier we published a report that\nhighlighted their tactics -- a tactical shift in response would not have been unprecedented.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs weeks turned into months, we found that Kuluoz didn t return. We weren t the only ones\n[who noticed; Brad Duncan wrote a blog for the SANS indicating that the e-mails which had](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/What+Happened+to+You+Asprox+Botnet/19435/)\npreviously carried Kuluoz were now just…spam.\n\nBased on the data we’ve collected, the Kuluoz command and control infrastructure largely\nshut down in January and the botnet is no more. We continue to capture new samples of\n[Kuluoz in WildFire as orphaned infections continue sending out newly-crypted variants of the](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/technologies/wildfire.html)\nmalware, but the numbers are a tiny fraction of Kuluoz at its peak.\n\nThe original Asprox botnet has gone through multiple incarnations since it came online in\n2007. We’ve not yet seen any indication that the individuals behind these attacks have been\narrested or forced to stop operating, so it’s likely that they’ve shut down this botnet to\nregroup and redeploy after they’ve found ways to evade the detections deployed by the\nsecurity industry. After all, sending 80% of all malware puts you pretty high on everyone’s list\nof priorities.\n\nIf you are wondering what malware has replaced Kuluoz as our top family, the reigning\nchampion is Upatre, which is a downloader that typically installs the Dyre banking Trojan or\nthe CryptoWall Ransomware. It’s not nearly as prevalent as Kuluoz, but it’s certainly making\nan impression:\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
