The attackers appeared to have the ability to interact with SMB shares, and it's possible that they used\nmounted shares over SMB to transfer files from attacker-controlled infrastructure. There is also evidence that the attackers were able to\nbrowse the web through the backdoor, likely using it as a proxy to mask their IP address.\n\nThe goal of this campaign appears to have been espionage, as we saw the attackers exfiltrating data and staging data for exfiltration\nfrom infected networks.\n\n## Technical details\n\nAs well as the attack on the financial institution outlined in the case study below, Antlion compromised the networks of at least two\nother organizations in Taiwan, including another financial organization and a manufacturing company. The activity the group carried\nout on those networks was largely similar to the activity that is detailed in the case study, with the xPack backdoor frequently deployed\nand a lot of evidence of credential dumping. In the manufacturing target, also, we see the attackers attempting to download malicious\nfiles via SMB shares.\n\nThe attackers also spent a significant amount of time on both these targeted networks, spending close to 250 days on the financial\norganization and around 175 days on the manufacturing organization.\n\nSymantec, a division of Broadcom, cannot state with certainty what the initial infection vector used by the attackers in this campaign\nwas, though in one instance they were seen utilizing the MSSQL service to execute system commands, which indicates that the most\nlikely infection vector was exploitation of a web application or service. However, Antlion are also known to have previously used\nmalicious emails to gain initial access to victim networks.\n\nThe main custom backdoor used by Antlion in this campaign was the xPack backdoor, which is a custom .NET loader that decrypts\n(AES), loads, and executes accompanying .bin files. Its decryption password is provided as a command-line argument (Base64 encoded\nstring), and xPack is intended to be run as a standalone application or as a service (xPackSvc variant). The xPack malware and its\nassociated payload seems to be used for initial access; it appears that xPack was predominantly used to execute system commands,\ndrop subsequent malware and tools, and stage data for exfiltration. The attackers also used a custom keylogger and three custom\nloaders.\n\nEHAGBPSL loader - custom loader written in C++ - loaded by JpgRun loader\nJpgRun loader - customer loader written in C++ - similar to xPack, reads the decryption key and filename from the command line\n\n   - decodes the file and executes it\nCheckID - custom loader written in C++ - based on loader used by BlackHole RAT\n\nThe attackers also used a custom SMB session enumeration tool (NetSessionEnum), a custom bind/reverse file transfer tool named\nENCODE MMC, and a Kerberos golden ticket tool based on Mimikatz.\n\nThe attackers also used a variety of off-the-shelf tools, as well as leveraging living-off-the-land tools such as PowerShell, WMIC,\nProcDump, LSASS, and PsExec. The legitimate AnyDesk tool was also abused by the attackers for remote access in one of the victim\norganizations. The attackers were also observed leveraging exploits such as CVE-2019-1458 for privilege escalation and remote\nscheduled tasks to execute their backdoor. CVE-2019-1458 is an elevation-of-privilege vulnerability that occurs in Windows when the\nWin32k component fails to properly handle objects in memory.\n\nLegitimate versions of WinRAR appear to have been exploited by the attackers for data exfiltration, while there is also evidence of data\nexfiltration via PowerShell, specifically using the BitsTransfer module to initiate an upload to attacker-controlled infrastructure. There\nis also evidence that the attackers likely automated the data collection process via batch scripts, while there is also evidence of instances\n\n\n-----\n\nwhere data was likely staged for further exfiltration, though it was not actually observed being exfiltrated from the network. In these\ninstances, it appears the attackers were interested in collecting information from software pertaining to business contacts, investments,\nand smart card readers.\n\n## Case study: Attack on a financial organization\n\nThe attackers spent a significant amount of time on victims’ networks, and deployed both custom and off-the-shelf malware. In one\nfinancial sector victim in Taiwan the attackers spent almost nine months on the victim network.\n\nThe first suspicious activity on this victim network occurred in December 2020 when WMIC was used to execute two commands:\n\nwmic process get CSName,Description,ExecutablePath,ProcessId /format:”;CSIDL_SYSTEM\\wbem\\zh-tw\\htable.xsl”;\nwmic os get\nname,version,InstallDate,LastBootUpTime,LocalDateTime,Manufacturer,RegisteredUser,ServicePackMajorVersion,SystemDirectory\n/format:”;CSIDL_SYSTEM\\wbem\\zh-tw\\htable.xsl”;\n\nThe first command was used to list the computer name, description of processes, executable path, and process ID. The output was\nwritten to a suspicious file named htable.xsl under the wbem directory. The second command was used to collect information about the\nsystem, which was written out to the same file (htable.xsl). Information collected included:\n\nVersion of the operating system (OS)\nThe installation date\nThe last time the system was booted\nThe local date and time of the system\nThe manufacturer\nThe registered user\nService pack information - this can be used to determine what patches are installed\nSystem directory path\n\nFive minutes after those commands were issued, WMIC was used to dump credentials:\n\nreg save HKLM\\SAM CSIDL_COMMON_DOCUMENTS\\sam.hiv\nreg save HKLM\\SYSTEM CSIDL_COMMON_DOCUMENTS\\sys.hiv\nreg save hklm\\security CSIDL_COMMON_DOCUMENTS\\security.hiv\n\nThe commands listed above were all executed via Antlion’s custom xPack backdoor.\n\nSeveral days later, during the Christmas holiday period, the attackers returned over a period of a few days and executed the xPack\nbackdoor again. They also executed an unknown VBS script via PsExec multiple times:\n\n“;cscript.exe”; CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\update.vbs\n\nOn December 28, the attackers used xPack to launch a command prompt to dump credentials from several machines within the\ncompromised organization with the following commands:\n\nupload.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe 16.dmp (a renamed version of Sysinternals procdump64.exe)\nreg save hklm\\sam CSIDL_PROFILE\\publicsam.hive\nreg save hklm\\system CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\system.hive\nreg save hklm\\security CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\security.hive\n\nOver the following couple of weeks, the attackers continued to return intermittently to launch the xPack backdoor or to dump\ncredentials via the registry. Then, following a few weeks of inactivity, they become active on the infected network once again.\n\nThe attackers used the xPack backdoor to launch a command prompt to execute the following commands:\n\n“;cmd”; /K CHCP 950\nCHCP 950\nquery user\n“;CSIDL_SYSTEM\\quser.exe”;\ntasklist /v\nfindstr explorer\ncmd /c dir “;CSIDL_PROFILE\\desktop”;\nCSIDL_SYSTEM\\cmd.exe /c cmd /c dir \\users /b\ncmd /c dir “;CSIDL_PROFILE\\desktop”;\ncmd /c dir \\users /b\n\n\n-----\n\nreg save hklm\\security CSIDL_COMMON_DOCUMENTS\\security.hiv\nrar a -r -hp1qaz@WSX3edc!@# W22-009-099.tmp “;CSIDL_COMMON_DOCUMENTS\\w22-009-099_file”;\nreg save hklm\\system CSIDL_COMMON_DOCUMENTS\\system.hiv\nreg save hklm\\sam CSIDL_COMMON_DOCUMENTS\\sam.hiv\n\nThe above commands were used to firstly change the code page to 950, which is the Windows code page for Traditional Chinese. The\nattackers then executed 'query user' to list any logged-in users on the system, as well as running ‘tasklist’ to get a list of all the running\nprocesses on the system. They also tried to discover what processes were running, before listing all contents of the Desktop directory\nand the Users directory. After this, the attackers dumped credentials again via the registry.\n\nThe attackers returned to the network a couple of weeks later and carried out largely the same activity. The attackers remained active\non the network for March, April, and May 2021, intermittently returning to launch their xPack backdoor or dump credentials from the\nregistry. Dumping credentials appears to be a main focus of the attackers, with them likely using these credentials to move laterally\nacross the network to identify machines of interest from which they can exfiltrate data.\n\nThe last activity on this network, after a gap of three months, occurred in August 2021, when the attackers returned and listed all\navailable shares. They then dumped credentials from the registry and proceeded to collect account, group, and workstation\nconfiguration information.\n\nThey then dumped credentials from the registry once again. This was the last activity seen on this network.\n\n## Experienced actor stays active\n\nAntlion is believed to have been involved in espionage activities since at least 2011, and this recent activity shows that it is still an actor\nto be aware of more than 10 years after it first appeared.\n\nThe length of time that Antlion was able to spend on victim networks is notable, with the group able to spend several months on victim\nnetworks, affording plenty of time to seek out and exfiltrate potentially sensitive information from infected organizations. The targeting\nof Taiwan is perhaps unsurprising given we know Chinese state-backed groups tend to be interested in organizations in that region.\n\n## Protection\n\n[For the latest protection
