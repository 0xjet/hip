The wide number of sectors and geographies of the\norganizations targeted in this campaign is interesting. Cicada’s initial activity several years\nago was heavily focused on Japanese-linked companies, though in more recent times it has\nbeen linked to attacks on managed service providers (MSPs) with a more global footprint.\nHowever, this campaign does appear to indicate a further widening of Cicada’s targeting.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attribution of this activity to Cicada is based on the presence on victim networks of a\ncustom loader and custom malware that are believed to be exclusively used by the APT\ngroup.\n\nWhile Cicada has been linked to espionage-style operations dating back to 2009, the earliest\nactivity in this current campaign occurred in mid-2021, with the most recent activity seen in\nFebruary 2022, so this is a long-running attack campaign that may still be ongoing,\n[researchers from Symantec, a division of Broadcom, have found.](https://software.broadcom.com/)\n\n## Activity on infected networks\n\nIn several cases, the initial activity on victim networks is seen on Microsoft Exchange\nServers, suggesting the possibility that a known, unpatched vulnerability in Microsoft\nExchange may have been used to gain access to victim networks in some cases.\n\nOnce the attackers have successfully gained access to victim machines we observe them\ndeploying various different tools, including a custom loader and the Sodamaster backdoor.\nThe loader deployed in this campaign was also deployed in a previous Cicada attack.\n\nSodamaster is a known Cicada tool that is believed to be exclusively used by this group. It is\na fileless malware that is capable of multiple functions, including evading detection in a\nsandbox by checking for a registry key or delaying execution; enumerating the username,\nhostname, and operating system of targeted systems; searching for running processes, and\ndownloading and executing additional payloads. It is also capable of obfuscating and\nencrypting traffic that it sends back to its command-and-control (C&C) server. It is a powerful\nbackdoor that Cicada has been using since at least 2020.\n\nIn this campaign, the attackers are also seen dumping credentials, including by using a\ncustom Mimikatz loader. This version of Mimikatz drops mimilib.dll to obtain credentials in\nplain text for any user that is accessing the compromised host and provides persistence\nacross reboots.\n\nThe attackers also exploit the legitimate VLC Media Player by launching a custom loader via\nthe VLC Exports function, and use the WinVNC tool for remote control of victim machines.\n\nOther tools utilized in this attack campaign include:\n\nRAR archiving tool - can be used to compress, encrypt, or archive files, likely for\nexfiltration.\nSystem/Network discovery - a way for attackers to determine what systems or services\nare connected to an infected machine.\nWMIExec - Microsoft command-line tool that can be used to execute commands on\nremote computers.\nNBTScan - an open-source tool that has been observed being used by APT groups to\nconduct internal reconnaissance within a compromised network\n\n\n-----\n\n## Victims\n\nThe victims in this campaign appear to primarily be government-related institutions or NGOs,\nwith some of these NGOs working in the fields of education and religion. There were also\nvictims in the telecoms, legal, and pharmaceutical sectors.\n\nThe victims are spread through a wide number of regions including the U.S., Canada, Hong\nKong, Turkey, Israel, India, Montenegro, and Italy. There is also just one victim in Japan,\nwhich is notable due to Cicada’s previous strong focus on Japanese-linked companies.\n\nThe attackers spent as long as nine months on the networks of some victims.\n\nThe victims targeted, the various tools deployed in this campaign, and what we know of\nCicada’s past activity all indicate that the most likely goal of this campaign is espionage.\n[Cicada activity was linked by U.S. government officials to the Chinese government in 2018.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\n\n## Significance of this activity\n\nThis is a long-running campaign from a sophisticated and experienced nation-state-backed\nactor that may still be ongoing, as the most recent activity we saw in this campaign was in\nFebruary 2022. The targeting of multiple large organizations in different geographies at the\nsame time would require a lot of resources and skills that are generally only seen in nationstate backed groups, and shows that Cicada still has a lot of firepower behind it when it\ncomes to its cyber activities.\n\n## Protection\n\n[For the latest protection updates, please visit the Symantec Protection Bulletin.](https://www.broadcom.com/support/security-center/protection-bulletin)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nIf an IOC is malicious and the file available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect\nand block that file.\n\n01b610e8ffcb8fd85f2d682b8a364cad2033c8104014df83988bc3ddfac8e6ec\n\n056c0628be2435f2b2031b3287726eac38c94d1e7f7aa986969baa09468043b1\n\n062ce400f522f90909ed5c4783c5e9c60b63c09272e2ddde3d13e748a528fa88\n\n0b452f7051a74a1d4a544c0004b121635c15f80122dc6be54db660ceb2264d6f\n\n0ec48b297dd1b0d6c3ddd15ab63f405191d7a849049feedfa7e44096c6f9d42a\n\n20fc3cf1afcad9e6f19e9abebfc9daf374909801d874c3d276b913f12d6230ec\n\n\n-----\n\n2317d3e14ab214f06ae38a729524646971e21b398eda15cc9deb8b00b231abc3\n\n2417da3adebd446b9fcb8b896adb14ea495a4d923e3655e5033f78d8e648fcc8\n\n37f56127226ce96af501c8d805e76156ca6b87da1ba1bb5d227100912f6c52d9\n\n3aa54e7d99b69a81c8b25ab57aeb971644ed0a206743c9e51a80ec1852f03663\n\n3ff2d6954a6b62afb7499e1e317af64502570181fd49ac5a74e2f7947e2e89db\n\n4f6a768841595293146ca04f879efa988e4e95ce0f2bc299cb669fea55e78b65\n\n5269db6b19a1d758c75e58ee9bbf2f8fd684cfedbfe712d5b0182d7bbd3a1690\n\n5bc68df582c86c884b563b15057cc223f2e9bc1022ebb297e32a9a7e3036228b\n\n6b4692029f05489ecda10e11cfacfc3b19097856b88647d3695f3bdc7dd83ce9\n\n7b581c0305c78f28bad60028c63e852dc34fc9e28f39e4b0af73d80c1d9680c9\n\n83030f299a776114878bcd2ade585d97836ef4ddb6943cb796be2c88bcb83a83\n\n90a03dabfc4e56a12cc3bac5cbe991db044b900a01ec341803c864506e467ffa\n\n9917a2213f114e87745867e5fea6717efd727d7c08fdc851969224be2f0e019b\n\n9b5f9ff82ed238bcbd83628ed3ec84988dc05f81cec9e45a512fbd2c8ac45c33\n\nadfe177ade7d9bfe4df251a69678102aec1104a4ba9f73032dd90aba76d8bdd9\n\nb76fde584f87c88bdd21fab613335ce7fc05788aa4bb3191d1517ec16ef4d11a\n\nce45af43dd2af52d6034e981515474147802efdfe036e00078fee29a01694fd6\n\nd461347388ccf0c2008332a1674885a41f70b94b2263bddef44e796d3b1b43b5\n\ndf993dca434c3cd2da94b6a90b0ae1650d9c95ea1d5f6a5267aca640d8c6d00e\n\nee46e714660f7652502d5b3633fae0c08c8018f51cfb56a487afd58d04dd551a\n\nfe33fdd5a63fee62362c9db329dde11080a0152e513ef0e6f680286a6a7b243f\n\n88[.]198.101[.]58\n\n168[.]100.8[.]38\n\n\n-----\n\n## About the Author\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n**Symantec**\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to\ninvestigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer\nanalysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n\n-----",
