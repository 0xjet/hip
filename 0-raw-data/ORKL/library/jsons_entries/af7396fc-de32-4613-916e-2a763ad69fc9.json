A large\n\nscale cyber-espionage network was revealed and analyzed during the investigation, which we called \"Red\n\nOctober\" (after famous novel \"The Hunt For The Red October\").\n\nThis report is based on detailed technical analysis of a series of targeted attacks against diplomatic,\n\ngovernmental and scientific research organizations in different countries, mostly related to the region of\n\nEastern Europe, former USSR members and countries in Central Asia.\n\nThe main objective of the attackers was to gather intelligence from the compromised organizations, which\n\nincluded computer systems, personal mobile devices and network equipment.\n\nThe earliest evidence indicates that the cyber-espionage campaign was active since 2007 and is still active\n\nat the time of writing (January 2013). Besides that, registration data used for the purchase of several\n\nCommand & Control (C&C) servers and unique malware filenames related to the current attackers hints at\n\neven earlier time of activity dating back to May 2007.\n\n## Main Findings\n\n**Advanced Cyber-espionage Network: The attackers have been active for at least several years,**\n\nfocusing on diplomatic and governmental agencies of various countries across the world.\n\n\n-----\n\nwere compiled in a list and used when the attackers needed to guess secret phrase in other locations. To\n\ncontrol the network of infected machines, the attackers created more than 60 domain names and several\n\nserver hosting locations in different countries (mainly Germany and Russia). The C&C infrastructure is\n\nactually a chain of servers working as proxies and hiding the location of the 'mothership' control server.\n\n**Unique architecture: The attackers created a multi-functional kit which has a capability of quick**\n\nextension of the features that gather intelligence. The system is resistant to C&C server takeover and\n\nallows the attack to recover access to infected machines using alternative communication channels.\n\n**Broad variety of targets: Beside traditional attack targets (workstations), the system is capable of**\n\nstealing data from mobile devices, such as smartphones (iPhone, Nokia, Windows Mobile), enterprise\n\nnetwork equipment (Cisco), removable disk drives (including already deleted files via a custom file\n\nrecovery procedure).\n\n**Importation of exploits: The samples we managed to find were using exploit code for vulnerabilities in**\n\nMicrosoft Word and Microsoft Excel that were created by other attackers and employed during different\n\ncyber attacks. The attackers left the imported exploit code untouched, perhaps to harden the identification\n\nprocess.\n\n**Attacker identification: Basing on registration data of C&C servers and numerous artifacts left in**\n\nexecutables of the malware, we strongly believe that the attackers have Russian-speaking origins. Current\n\nattackers and executables developed by them have been unknown until recently, they have never related to\n\nany other targeted cyberattacks.\n\n## Anatomy of the attack\n\n**General description**\n\nThese attacks comprised of the classical scenario of specific targeted attacks, consisting of two major\n\nstages:\n\n1. Initial infection\n\n2. Additional modules deployed for intelligence gathering\n\nThe malicious code was delivered via e-mail as attachments (Microsoft Excel, Word and, probably PDF\n\ndocuments) which were rigged with exploit code for known security vulnerabilities in the mentioned\n\napplications. In addition to Office documents (CVE-2009-3129, CVE-2010-3333, CVE-2012-0158), it\n\nappears that the attackers also infiltrated victim network(s) via Java exploitation (known as the 'Rhino'\n\nexploit (CVE-2011-3544).\n\n\n-----\n\nembedded malicious code initiated the setup of the main component which in turn handled further\n\ncommunication with the C&C servers.\n\nNext, the system receives a number of additional spy modules from the C&C server, including modules to\n\nhandle infection of smartphones.\n\nThe main purpose of the spying modules is to steal information. This includes files from different\n\n[cryptographic systems, such as \"Acid Cryptofiler\", (see https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_Cryptofiler)](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_Cryptofiler)\n\nwhich is known to be used in organizations of European Union/European Parliament/European\n\nCommission since the summer of 2011. All gathered information is packed, encrypted and only then\n\ntransferred to the C&C server.\n\n**Step-by-step description (1st stage)**\n\nDuring our investigation we couldn't find any e-mails used in the attacks, only top level dropper\n\ndocuments. Nevertheless, based on indirect evidence, we know that the e-mails can be sent using one of\n\nthe following methods:\n\nUsing an anonymous mailbox from a free public email service provider\n\nUsing mailboxes from already infected organizations\n\nE-mail subject lines as well as the text in e-mail bodies varied depending on the target (recipient). The\n\nattached file contained the exploit code which activated a Trojan dropper in the system.\n\nWe have observed the use of at least three different exploits for previously known vulnerabilities: CVE\n2009-3129 (MS Excel), CVE-2010-3333 (MS Word) and CVE-2012-0158 (MS Word). The first attacks that\n\nused the exploit for MS Excel started in 2010, while attacks targeting the MS Word vulnerabilities\n\nappeared in the summer of 2012.\n\nAs a notable fact, the attackers used exploit code that was made public and originally came from a\n\npreviously known targeted attack campaign with Chinese origins. The only thing that was changed is the\n\nexecutable which was embedded in the document; the attackers replaced it with their own code.\n\nThe embedded executable is a file-dropper, which extracts and runs three additional files.\n\n%TEMP%MSC.BAT\n\n%ProgramFiles%WINDOWS NTLHAFD.GCP (<- This file name varies)\n\n%ProgramFiles%WINDOWS NTSVCHOST.EXE\n\n\n-----\n\nchcp 1251\n\n:Repeat\n\nattrib -a -s -h -r \"%DROPPER_FILE%\"\n\ndel \"%DROPPER_FILE%\"\n\nif exist \"%DROPPER_FILE%\" goto Repeat\n\ndel \"%TEMP%msc.bat\"\n\nAnother noteworthy fact is in the first line of this file, which is a command to switch the codepage of an\n\ninfected system to 1251. This is required to address files and directories that contain Cyrillic characters in\n\ntheir names.\n\nThe \"LHAFD.GCP\" file is encrypted with RC4 and compressed with the \"Zlib\" library. This file is\n\n\n-----\n\ninto system memory and is responsible for communication with the C&C server.\n\nOn any infected system, every major task is performed by the main backdoor component. The main\n\ncomponent is started only after its loader (\"svchost.exe\") checks if the internet connection is available. It\n\ndoes so by connecting to three Microsoft hosts:\n\nupdate.microsoft.com\n\nwww.microsoft.com\n\nsupport.microsoft.com\n\nFigure - Hosts used to validate internet connection\n\n\n-----\n\nconnects to its C&C servers:\n\nCapture of malware's communication with the C2\n\nThe connections with the C&C are encrypted - different encryption algorithms are used to send and\n\nreceive data.\n\nEncrypted communication with the C2\n\nDuring our investigation, we found more than 60 different command-and-control domains. Each malware\n\nsample contains three such domains, which are hardcoded inside the main backdoor component:\n\n\n-----\n\nHardcoded C2 domains inside backdoor\n\n**Step-by-step description (2nd stage)**\n\nAfter a connection with the C&C server is established, the backdoor starts the communication process,\n\nwhich leads to the loading of additional modules. These modules can be split into two categories: \"offline\"\n\nand \"online\". The main difference between these categories is their behavior on the infected system:\n\n\"Offline\": exists as files on local disk, capable of creating its own system registry keys, local disk log\n\nfiles, and may communicate with C&C servers on their own.\n\n\"Online\": exists only in system memory and is never saved to local disk, do not create registry keys,\n\nall logs are also kept in memory instead of local disk and sends the result of work to the C&C server\n\nusing own code.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere is a notable module among all others, which is essentially created to be embedded into Adobe\n\nReader and Microsoft Office applications. The main purpose of its code is to create a foolproof way to\n\nregain access to the target system. The module expects a specially crafted document with attached\n\nexecutable code and special tags. The document may be sent to the victim via e-mail. It will not have an\n\nexploit code and will safely pass all security checks. However, like with exploit case, the document will be\n\ninstantly processed by the module and the module will start a malicious application attached to the\n\ndocument.\n\nThis trick can be used to regain access to the infected machines in case of unexpected C&C servers\n\nshutdown/takeover.\n\n## Timeline\n\nWe have identified over 1000 different malicious files related to over 30 modules of this Trojan kit. Most\n\nof them were created between May 2010 and October 2012.\n\nThere were 115 file-creation dates identified which are related to these campaigns via emails during the\n\nlast two and a half years. Concentration of file creation dates around a particular day may indicate date of\n\nthe massive attacks (which was also confirmed by some of our side observations):\n\n**Year 2010**\n\n19.05.2010\n\n21.07.2010\n\n04.09.2010\n\n\n-----\n\n05.01.2011\n\n14.03.2011\n\n05.04.2011\n\n23.06.2011\n\n06.09.2011\n\n21.09.2011\n\n**Year 2012**\n\n12.01.2012\n\nBelow is a list of sample attachment filenames that were sent to some of the victims:\n\n**File name:**\n\nKatyn_-_opinia_Rosjan.xls\n\nFIEO contacts update.xls\n\nspisok sotrudnikov.xls\n\nList of shahids.xls\n\nSpravochnik.xls\n\nTelephone.xls\n\nBMAC Attache List - At 11 Oct_v1[1].XLS\n\nMERCOSUR_Imports.xls\n\nCópia de guia de telefonos (2).xls\n\nProgramme de fetes 2011.xls\n\n12 05 2011 updated.xls\n\ntelefonebi.xls\n\n## Targets\n\nWe used two approaches to identify targets for these attacks. First, we used the Kaspersky Security\n\nNetwork (KSN) and then we set up our own sinkhole server. The data received using two independent\n\nways was correlating and this confirmed objective findings.\n\n**KSN statistics**\n\nThe attackers used already detected exploit codes and because of this, in the beginning of the research we\n\nalready had some statistics of detections with our anti-malware software. We searched for similar\n\ndetections for the period of 2011-2012.\n\n\n-----\n\nTrojan kit.\n\n|RUSSIAN FEDERATION|35|\n|---|---|\n|KAZAKHSTAN|21|\n|AZERBAIJAN|15|\n|BELGIUM|15|\n|INDIA|15|\n|AFGHANISTAN|10|\n|ARMENIA|10|\n|IRAN|7|\n|TURKMENISTAN|7|\n|UKRAINE|6|\n|UNITED STATES|6|\n|VIET NAM|6|\n|BELARUS|5|\n|GREECE|5|\n|ITALY|5|\n|MOROCCO|5|\n|PAKISTAN|5|\n|SWITZERLAND|5|\n|UGANDA|5|\n|UNITED ARAB EMIRATES|5|\n|BRAZIL|4|\n|FRANCE|4|\n|GEORGIA|4|\n|GERMANY|4|\n|JORDAN|4|\n|MOLDOVA|4|\n|SOUTH AFRICA|4|\n|TAJIKISTAN|4|\n|TURKEY|4|\n|UZBEKISTAN|4|\n|AUSTRIA|3|\n|CYPRUS|3|\n|KYRGYZSTAN|3|\n|LEBANON|3|\n|MALAYSIA|3|\n|QATAR|3|\n\n\nSAUDI ARABIA 3\n\n\n-----\n\n|INDONESIA|2|\n|---|---|\n|KENYA|2|\n|LITHUANIA|2|\n|OMAN|2|\n|TANZANIA|2|\n\n\nCountries with more than one infections\n\nOnce again, this is based on data from Kaspersky AV products. Apparently, real number and list of victim\n\nnames is much larger than mentioned above.\n\n## Sinkhole statistics\n\nDuring our analysis, we uncovered more than 60 different domains used by different variants of the\n\nmalware.\n\nOut of the list of domains, several were expired so we registered them to evaluate the number of victims\n\nconnecting to them.\n\nThe following domains have been registered and sinkholed by Kaspersky Lab:\n\n**Domain** **Date sinkholed**\n\nshellupdate.com 5-Dec-2012\n\nmsgenuine.net 19-Nov-2012\n\nmicrosoft-msdn.com 5-Nov-2012\n\nwindowsonlineupdate.com\ndll-host-update.com 2-Nov-2012\nwindows-genuine.com\n\nAll the sinkholed domains currently point to \"95.211.172.143\", which is Kasperskys' sinkhole server.\n\nDuring the monitoring period (2- Nov 2012 - 10 Jan 2013), we registered over 55,000 connections to the\n\nsinkhole. The most popular domain is \"dll-host-update.com\", which is receiving most of the traffic.\n\n|Domain|Date sinkholed|\n|---|---|\n|shellupdate.com|5-Dec-2012|\n|msgenuine.net|19-Nov-2012|\n|microsoft-msdn.com|5-Nov-2012|\n|windowsonlineupdate.com dll-host-update.com windows-genuine.com|2-Nov-2012|\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the point of view of country distribution of connections to the sinkhole, we have observed victims in\n\n39 countries, with most of IPs being from Switzerland. Kazakhstan and Greece follow next.\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, when connecting to the sinkhole, the backdoors submit their unique victim ID, which allows\n\nus to separate the multiple IPs per victims.\n\nBased on the traffic received to our sinkhole, we created the following list of unique victim IDs, countries\n\nand possible profiles:\n\n|Victim ID|Country|Victim profile|\n|---|---|---|\n|0706010C1BC0B9E5B702|Kazakhstan|Gov research institute|\n|0F746C2F283E2FACE581|Kazakhstan|?|\n|150BD7E7449C42C66ED1|Kazakhstan|?|\n|15B7400DBC4975BFAEF6|Austria|?|\n\n\n-----\n\n|3619E36303A2A56DC880|Russia|Foreign Embassy|\n|---|---|---|\n|4624C55DEF872FBF2A93|Spain|?|\n|4B5181583F843A904568|Spain|?|\n|4BB2783B8AEC0B439CE8|Switzerland|?|\n|5392032B24AAEE8F3333|Kazakhstan|?|\n|569530675E86118895C4|Pakistan|?|\n|57FE04BA107DD56D2820|Iran|Foreign Embassy|\n|5D4102CD1D87417FF93B|Russia|Gov research institute|\n|5E65486EF8CC4EE4DB5B|Japan|Foreign Trade Commission|\n|6127D685ED1E72E09201|Kazakhstan|?|\n|6B9AFF89A02958C79C17|Ireland|Foreign Embassy|\n|6D97B24C08DD64EEDE03|Czech Republic|?|\n|7B14DE85C80368337E87|Turkey|?|\n|89BF96469244534DC092|Belarus|Gov research institute|\n|8AA071A22BEDD8D8EC13|Moldova|Government|\n|8C58407030570D3A3F52|Albania|?|\n|947827A169348FB01E2F|Bosnia and Herzegovina|?|\n|B34C94D561B348EAC75D|Switzerland|?|\n|B49FC93701E7B7F83C44|Belgium|?|\n|B6E4946A47FC3963ABC1|Kazakhstan|Energy research group|\n|C978C25326D96C995038|Russia|?|\n|D48A783D288DC72A702B|Kazakhstan|Aerospace|\n|DAE795D285E0A01ADED5|Russia|Trading company|\n|DD767EEEF83A62388241|Russia|Gov research institute|\n\n\nIn some cases, it is possible to create a profile of the victim based on the IP address; in most of the cases,\n\nhowever, the identity of the victim remains unknown.\n\n## KSN + sinkhole data\n\nSome of the victim organizations were identified using IP addresses and public WHOIS information or\n\nremote system names.\n\nMost \"interesting\" out of those are:\n\nAlgeria - Embassy\n\nAfghanistan - Gov, Military, Embassy,\n\nArmenia - Gov, Embassy\n\nAustria - Embassy\n\nAzerbaijan - Oil/Energy Embassy Research\n\n\n-----\n\ng y\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina - Embassy\n\nBotswana - Embassy\n\nBrunei Darussalam – Gov\n\nCongo – Embassy\n\nCyprus - Embassy, Gov\n\nFrance - Embassy, Military\n\nGeorgia - Embassy\n\nGermany - Embassy\n\nGreece – Embassy\n\nHungary -Embassy\n\nIndia – Embassy\n\nIndonesia - Embassy\n\nIran – Embassy\n\nIraq – Gov\n\nIreland - Embassy\n\nIsrael - Embassy\n\nItaly -Embassy\n\nJapan - Trade, Embassy\n\nJordan - Embassy\n\nKazakhstan - Gov, Research, Aerospace, Nuclear/Energy, Military\n\nKenya - Embassy\n\nKuwait - Embassy\n\nLatvia - Embassy\n\nLebanon - Embassy\n\nLithuania - Embassy\n\nLuxembourg - Gov\n\nMauritania - Embassy\n\nMoldova - Gov, Military, Embassy\n\nMorocco - Embassy\n\nMozambique - Embassy\n\nOman - Embassy\n\nPakistan - Embassy\n\nPortugal - Embassy\n\nQatar - Embassy\n\nRussia - Embassy, Research, Military, Nuclear/Energy\n\nSaudi Arabia - Embassy\n\nSouth Africa - Embassy\n\nSpain Gov Embassy\n\n\n-----\n\nTanzania Embassy\n\nTurkey - Embassy\n\nTurkmenistan - Gov, Oil/Energy\n\nUganda - Embassy\n\nUkraine - Military\n\nUnited Arab Emirates - Oil/Energy, Embassy, Gov\n\nUnited States - Embassy\n\nUzbekistan - Embassy\n\n## С&C information\n\nA list of the most popular domains used for command and control can be found below:\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, although the domain \"dll-host-update.com\" appears in one of the malware configurations, it\n\nhad not been registered by the attackers. The domain has since been registered by Kaspersky Lab on Nov\n\n2nd, 2012 to monitor the attacker's activities.\n\nAnother interesting example is \"dll-host-udate.com\" - the \"udate\" part appears to be a typo.\n\nAll the domains used by attackers appear to have been registered between 2007-2012. The oldest known\n\ndomain was registered in Nov 2007; the newest on May 2012.\n\nMost of the domains have been registered using the service \"reg.ru\", but other services such as\n\n\"webdrive.ru\", \"webnames.ru\" or \"timeweb.ru\" have been used as well.\n\nDuring our monitoring, we observed the domains pointing to several malicious webservers. A list of\n\nservers with confirmed malicious behavior can be found below.\n\nIn total, we have identified 10 different servers which exhibited confirmed malicious behavior. Most of\n\nthese severs are located in Germany, at Hetzner Online Ag.\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring our analysis, we were able to obtain an image of one of the command-and-control servers. The\n\nserver itself proved to be a proxy, which was forwarding the request to another server on port 40080. The\n\nscript responsible for redirections was found in /root/scp.pl and relies on the \"socat\" tool for stream\n\nredirection.\n\nBy scanning the Internet for computers with port 40080 open, we were able to identify three such servers\n\nin total, which we call \"mini-motherships\":\n\nConnecting to these hosts on port 40080 and fetching the index page, we get the following standard\n\ncontent which is identical in all C&Cs:\n\nFetching the index info (via HTTP \"HEAD\") for these servers, reveals the following:\n\ncurl -I --referer \"http://www.google.com/\" --user-agent \"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows\n[NT 5.1)\" http://31.41.45.139:40080](http://31.41.45.139:40080/)\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Mon, 12 Nov 2012 09:58:37 GMT\nServer: Apache\nLast-Modified: Tue, 21 Feb 2012 09:00:41 GMT\nETag: \"8c0bf6-ba-4b975a53906e4\"\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nContent-Length: 186\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n\n-----\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Mon, 12 Nov 2012 09:59:09 GMT\nServer: Apache\nLast-Modified: Tue, 21 Feb 2012 09:00:41 GMT\nETag: \"8c0bf6-ba-4b975a53906e4\"\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nContent-Length: 186\nContent-Type: text/html\n\nIt should be noted that the \"last modified\" field of the pages points to the same date: Tue, 21 Feb 2012\n\n09:00:41 GMT. This is important and probably indicates that the three known mini-motherships are\n\nprobably just proxies themselves, pointing to the same top level \"mothership\" server.\n\nThis allows us to draw the following diagram of the C&C infrastructure as of November 2012:\n\nFor the Command and Control servers, the various generations of the backdoor connect to different\n\nscripts:\n\n**Domain** **Script location**\n\n/ i bi / t/th\n\n|Domain|Script location|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n|dll-host-update.com|/cgi-bin/dllhost/ac|\n|---|---|\n|microsoft-msdn.com|/cgi-bin/ms/check /cgi-bin/ms/flush|\n|windows-genuine.com|/cgi-bin/win/wcx /cgi-bin/win/cab|\n|windowsonlineupdate.com|/cgi-bin/win/cab|\n\n\nFor instance, the script \"/cgi-bin/nt/th\" is being used to receive commands from the command-and\ncontrol server, usually in the form of new plugins to run on the victim's computer. The \"/cgi-bin/nt/sk\"\n\nscript is called by the running plugins to upload stolen data and information about the victim.\n\nWhen connecting to the C&C, the backdoor identifies itself with a specific string which includes a\n\nhexadecimal value that appears to be the victim's unique ID. Different variants of the backdoor contain\n\ndifferent victim IDs. Presumably, this allows the attackers to distinguish between the multitudes of\n\nconnections and perform specific operations for each victim individually.\n\nFor instance, a top level XLS dropper presumably used against a Polish target, named \"Katyn_\n_opinia_Rosjan.xls\" contains the hardcoded victim ID \"F50D0B17F870EB38026F\". A similar XLS named\n\n\"tactlist_05-05-2011_.8634.xls / EEAS New contact list (05-05-2011).xls\" possibly used in Moldova\n\ncontains a victim ID \"FCF5E48A0AE558F4B859\".\n\n**Part 2 of this paper will cover malware modules and provide more technical details about**\n\n**their operation.**\n\n\n-----",
