Using we were able to develop indicators of compromise\ntechniques developed to match the network traffic primarily based on the network traffic generated by the\nTaidoor malware generate when communicating with a malware used in the Taidoor campaign. Using data\ncommand-and-control (C&C) server, we were able to collected from the Trend Micro™ Smart Protection\nidentify victims that these appeared to have Network™, we are able to identify victims whose\ncompromised. All of the compromise victims we networks communicated with Taidoor C&C servers.\ndiscovered were from Taiwan, the majority of which While we are unable to determine the exact method by\nwere government organizations. which any of the victims’ networks were compromised,\n\nthe information we collected did indicate which specific\nTaidoor malware samples contacted which C&C servers.\nWe also obtained email samples associated with the\ndelivery of the Taidoor malware samples. As such, we\nwere able to provide an overview of the Taidoor\ncampaign, including the attack vectors and malware the\nattackers used, and come up with a remediation\nstrategy.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CONTEXT ATTACK VECTORS\n\nThe Taidoor attackers have been actively engaging in The Taidoor campaign exploits a wide variety of\ntargeted attacks since at least March 4, 2009. Despite vulnerabilities as attack vectors, old and new alike. Data\nsome exceptions, the Taidoor campaign often used from the early part of this year shows that the Taidoor\nTaiwanese IP addresses as C&C servers and email attackers rampantly used malicious .DOC files to exploit\naddresses to send out socially engineered emails with a Microsoft Common Controls vulnerability, CVE-2012-\nmalware as attachments. One of the primary targets of 0158.[1]\nthe Taidoor campaign appeared to be the Taiwanese\ngovernment. The attackers spoofed Taiwanese Historical data, on the other hand, shows that the\ngovernment email addresses to send out socially Taidoor attackers also distributed emails with malicious\nengineered emails in the Chinese language that typically .PDF file attachments that exploited Adobe Reader,\nleveraged Taiwan-themed issues. The attackers actively Acrobat, or Flash Player vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2009-\nsent out malicious documents and maintained several IP 4324, 2CVE-2010-1297, 3 CVE-2010-2883,4 and CVE-2011-\naddresses for command and control. 0611).[5] They also used malicious Microsoft Excel and\n\nPowerPoint files (e.g., CVE-2011-1269[6] and CVE-2009-\n3129)[7] to exploit old vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office.\n\n##### Social Engineering Ploy\n\nAs part of their social engineering ploy, the Taidoor\nattackers attach a decoy document to their emails that,\nwhen opened, displays the contents of a legitimate\ndocument but executes a malicious payload in the\nbackground.\n\n1 [http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0158)\n[2012-0158](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0158)\n2 [http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2009-](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2009-4324)\n[4324](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2009-4324)\n3 [http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-1297)\n[1297](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-1297)\n4 [http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-2883)\n[2883](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-2883)\n5 [http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-0611)\n[0611](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-0611)\n6 [http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-1269)\n[1269](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-1269)\n7 [http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2009-](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2009-3129)\n[3129](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2009-3129)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### OPERATIONS TECHNICAL INDICATORS\n\nWe were only able to gather a limited amount of System Modifications\ninformation regarding the Taidoor attackers’ activities\nafter they have compromised a target. We did, however,\n\nOpening a malicious document (i.e., .PDF, .DOC, .XLS, or\n\nfind that the Taidoor malware allowed attackers to\n\n.PPT file) allows the Taidoor malware to create two files\n\noperate an interactive shell on compromised computers\n\nin a user’s Temp folder—C:\\Documents and\n\nand to upload and download files. In order to determine\n\nSettings\\[USER]\\Local Settings\\Temp. The first file is\n\nthe operational capabilities of the attackers behind the\n\ntypically a small executable file (i.e., 17.5KB) named “[2\n\nTaidoor campaign, we monitored a compromised\n\ncharacters].tmp.” This is copied to another folder,\n\nhoneypot. The attackers issued out some basic\n\nusually C:\\Documents and Settings\\[USER]\\Local\n\ncommands in an attempt to map out the extent of the\n\nSettings, and renamed to “~dfds3.reg,” which modifies\n\nnetwork compromise but quickly realized that the\n\nthe Windows Registry before being deleted.\n\nhoneypot was not an intended targeted and so promptly\ndisabled the Taidoor malware running on it. This\nindicated that while Taidoor malware were more widely Persistence Mechanism\ndistributed compared with those tied to other targeted\ncampaigns, the attackers could quickly assess their\n\nThe Taidoor malware uses the file, ~dfds3.reg, to modify\n\ntargets and distinguish these from inadvertently\n\nthe Windows Registry in order to maintain persistence.\n\ncompromised computers and honeypots.\n\nWhile the names of the registry entries and the\nexecutable files may vary, these consistently modified\nthe key, HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\\nCurrentVersion\\Run.\n\n##### Network Traffic\n\nThe Taidoor malware produces identifiable network\ntraffic. These often directly accessed an IP address.\nSometimes, however, certain samples made use of\ndomain names for HTTP communication. In such a case,\nthe GET and POST requests contained a URL path such\nas:\n```\n                                          aaaaa.php?id=bbbbbbcccccccccccc\n\n```\n“aaaaa” refers to five random characters that form a\nfile name such as “qfgkt.php,” followed by “bbbbbb,” six\npseudorandomly generated characters that change for\neach connection. “cccccccccccc” refers to 12 characters\nthat represent the compromised host’s MAC address\nthat is obfuscated using a custom algorithm. The\ncompromised host’s MAC address is communicated to\nthe Taidoor C&C server this way because it is used as an\nRC4 encryption key to encrypt the subsequent network\ncommunication between the compromised host and the\nC&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Malware Analysis Exploits, Payloads, and Decoy Documents\n\nThe shellcode in the exploit document is commonly\n\n###### Arrival Vectors encrypted.

Both\nexternal and local threat intelligence is crucial for\ndeveloping the ability to detect attacks early. The\nfollowing are the core components of this defense\nstrategy:\n\n                                         - Enhanced visibility: Logs from endpoint, server,\nand network monitoring are an important and\noften underused resource that can be\naggregated to provide a view of the activities\nwithin an organization that can be processed\nfor anomalous behaviors that can indicate a\ntargeted attack.\n\n                                         - Integrity checks: In order to maintain\npersistence, malware will make modifications to\nthe file system and registry. Monitoring such\nchanges can indicate the presence of malware.\n\n                                         - Empowering the human analyst: Humans are\nbest positioned to identify anomalous behaviors\nwhen presented with a view of aggregated logs\nfrom across a network.

Also, while cybercrime focuses on stealing credit card\nand banking information to gain profit, APTs are better thought of as cyber espionage.\n# TAIDOOR\n\n### • First Seen\n\nIndividual targeted attacks are not one-off attempts. Attackers continually try to get inside the target’s network.\n\nBased on Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ data, the earliest Taidoor campaign-related activities were seen as far back as October 2010.\n\n### • Victims and Targets\n\nAPT campaigns target specific industries or communities of interest in specific regions.\n\nThis campaign primarily targeted government organizations located in Taiwan.\n\n### • Operations\n\n\nIn this campaign, attackers sent an email to targets. The email came with specially created file attachments that exploited vulnerabilities such as\n_CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2009-4324, CVE-2010-1297, CVE-2010-2883, CVE-2011-0611, CVE-2011-1269, and CVE-2009-3129. The purpose of the file_\nattachment is to drop and install SIMBOT malware variants, which had functionalities normally seen in Remote Access Trojans (RATs).\n\n### • Possible Indicators of Compromise\n\n\nAttackers want to remain undetected as long as possible. A key characteristic of these attacks is stealth.\n\n\nThe GET and POST requests from compromised computers contained a URL path in the following format, aaaaa.php?id=bbbbbbcccccccccccc, where\n_“aaaaa” refers to five random characters that form a file name, “bbbbbb,” refers to six pseudorandomly generated characters that change for each_\nconnection, and “cccccccccccc” refers to 12 characters that represent the compromised host’s MAC address that is obfuscated using a custom\nalgorithm.\n\nIn addition, the initial command-and-control (C&C) server request typically uses the following format:\n\n[C&C]/{5 random characters}.php?id={6 random numbers}{encrypted victim’s MAC address}\n\n - The full technical details of this attack can be read in the Trend Micro research paper, “The Taidoor Campaign: An In-Depth Analysis.” The\n\ncharacteristics highlighted in this APT campaign profile reflect the results of our investigation as of August 2012.\n\n\n-----\n\nTR END MICRO™ TR END MICRO INC.\n\nTrend Micro Incorporated (TYO: 4704; TSE: 4704), a global cloud security leader, 10101 N.
