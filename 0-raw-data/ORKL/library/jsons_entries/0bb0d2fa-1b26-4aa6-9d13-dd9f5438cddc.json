    "plain_text": "# Protecting customers from a private-sector offensive actor using 0-day exploits and DevilsTongue malware\n\n**microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/15/protecting-customers-from-a-private-sector-offensive-actor-using-0-day-**\nexploits-and-devilstongue-malware/\n\nJuly 15, 2021\n\nThe Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) alongside the Microsoft Security Response\nCenter (MSRC) has uncovered a private-sector offensive actor, or PSOA, that we are calling\n[SOURGUM in possession of now-patched, Windows 0-day exploits (CVE-2021-31979 and](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-31979)\n[CVE-2021-33771).](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-33771)\n\nPrivate-sector offensive actors are private companies that manufacture and sell\ncyberweapons in hacking-as-a-service packages, often to government agencies around the\nworld, to hack into their targets’ computers, phones, network infrastructure, and other\ndevices. With these hacking packages, usually the government agencies choose the targets\nand run the actual operations themselves. The tools, tactics, and procedures used by these\n\n\n-----\n\ncompanies only adds to the complexity, scale, and sophistication of attacks. We take these\nthreats seriously and have moved swiftly alongside our partners to build in the latest\nprotections for our customers.\n\nMSTIC believes SOURGUM is an Israel-based private-sector offensive actor. We would like\nto thank the Citizen Lab, at the University of Toronto’s Munk School, for sharing the sample\nof malware that initiated this work and their collaboration during the investigation. In their\n[blog, Citizen Lab asserts with high confidence that SOURGUM is an Israeli company](https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/)\n[commonly known as Candiru. Third-party reports indicate Candiru produces “hacking tools](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-top-secret-israeli-cyberattack-firm-revealed-1.6805950)\n\n[that] are used to break into computers and servers”.\n\n[As we shared in the Microsoft on the Issues blog, Microsoft and Citizen Lab have worked](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/07/15/cyberweapons-cybersecurity-sourgum-malware/)\ntogether to disable the malware being used by SOURGUM that targeted more than 100\nvictims around the world including politicians, human rights activists, journalists, academics,\nembassy workers, and political dissidents. To limit these attacks, Microsoft has created and\nbuilt protections into our products against this unique malware, which we are calling\n_DevilsTongue. We have shared these protections with the security community so that we can_\ncollectively address and mitigate this threat. We have also issued a software update that will\nprotect Windows customers from the associated exploits that the actor used to help deliver\nits highly sophisticated malware.\n\n## SOURGUM victimology\n\n[Media reports (1,](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/06/hacking-team-hacked-firm-sold-spying-tools-to-repressive-regimes-documents-claim) [2,](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/dec/20/citizen-lab-nso-dozens-of-aljazeera-journalists-allegedly-hacked-using-israeli-firm-spyware) [3) indicate that PSOAs often sell Windows exploits and malware in](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/phone-hacking-mollitiam-industries)\nhacking-as-a-service packages to government agencies. Agencies in Uzbekistan, United\nArab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia are among the list of Candiru’s [alleged previous customers.](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/10/03/meet-candiru-the-super-stealth-cyber-mercenaries-hacking-apple-and-microsoft-pcs-for-profit/__;!!OPvj_Mo!qxCbqIivPDfDqHshaSJGunR3h_DoOYV2RVnwMJgvScAoj3M1t_G2HZOUIdiCpg%24)\nThese agencies, then, likely choose whom to target and run the cyberoperations themselves.\n\nMicrosoft has identified over 100 victims of SOURGUM’s malware, and these victims are as\ngeographically diverse as would be expected when varied government agencies are believed\nto be selecting the targets. Approximately half of the victims were found in Palestinian\nAuthority, with most of the remaining victims located in Israel, Iran, Lebanon, Yemen, Spain\n(Catalonia), United Kingdom, Turkey, Armenia, and Singapore. To be clear, the identification\nof victims of the malware in a country doesn’t necessarily mean that an agency in that\ncountry is a SOURGUM customer, as international targeting is common.\n\nAny [Microsoft 365 Defender and](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/threat-protection/microsoft-365-defender) [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alerts containing detection](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/endpoint-defender)\nnames for the DevilsTongue malware name are signs of compromise by SOURGUM’s\nmalware. We have included a comprehensive list of detection names below for customers to\nperform additional hunting in their environments.\n\n## Exploits\n\n\n-----\n\nSOURGUM appears to use a chain of browser and Windows exploits, including 0-days, to\ninstall malware on victim boxes. Browser exploits appear to be served via single-use URLs\nsent to targets on messaging applications such as WhatsApp.\n\nDuring the investigation, Microsoft discovered two Windows 0-day exploits for vulnerabilities\ntracked as CVE-2021-31979 and CVE-2021-33771, both of which have been fixed in the July\n2021 security updates. These vulnerabilities allow privilege escalation, giving an attacker the\nability to escape browser sandboxes and gain kernel code execution. If customers have\ntaken the July 2021 security update, they are protected from these exploits.\n\n[CVE-2021-31979 fixes an integer overflow within Windows NT-based operating system](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-31979)\n(NTOS). This overflow results in an incorrect buffer size being calculated, which is then used\nto allocate a buffer in the kernel pool. A buffer overflow subsequently occurs while copying\nmemory to the smaller-than-expected destination buffer. This vulnerability can be leveraged\nto corrupt an object in an adjacent memory allocation. Using APIs from user mode, the\nkernel pool memory layout can be groomed with controlled allocations, resulting in an object\nbeing placed in the adjacent memory location. Once corrupted by the buffer overflow, this\nobject can be turned into a user mode to kernel mode read/write primitive. With these\nprimitives in place, an attacker can then elevate their privileges.\n\n[CVE-2021-33771 addresses a race condition within NTOS resulting in the use-after-free of a](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-33771)\nkernel object. By using multiple racing threads, the kernel object can be freed, and the freed\nmemory reclaimed by a controllable object. Like the previous vulnerability, the kernel pool\nmemory can be sprayed with allocations using user mode APIs with the hopes of landing an\nobject allocation within the recently freed memory. If successful, the controllable object can\nbe used to form a user mode to kernel mode read/write primitive and elevate privileges.\n\n## DevilsTongue malware overview\n\nDevilsTongue is a complex modular multi-threaded piece of malware written in C and C++\nwith several novel capabilities. Analysis is still on-going for some components and\ncapabilities, but we’re sharing our present understanding of the malware so defenders can\nuse this intelligence to protect networks and so other researchers can build on our analysis.\n\nFor files on disk, PDB paths and PE timestamps are scrubbed, strings and configs are\nencrypted, and each file has a unique hash. The main functionality resides in DLLs that are\nencrypted on disk and only decrypted in memory, making detection more difficult.\nConfiguration and tasking data is separate from the malware, which makes analysis harder.\nDevilsTongue has both user mode and kernel mode capabilities. There are several novel\ndetection evasion mechanisms built in. All these features are evidence that SOURGUM\ndevelopers are very professional, have extensive experience writing Windows malware, and\nhave a good understanding of operational security.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the malware is installed, a first-stage hijack malware DLL is dropped in a subfolder of\n_C:\\Windows\\system32\\IME\\; the folders and names of the hijack DLLs blend with legitimate_\nnames in the \\IME\\ directories. Encrypted second-stage malware and config files are\ndropped into subfolders of C:\\Windows\\system32\\config\\ with a .dat file extension. A thirdparty legitimate, signed driver physmem.sys is dropped to the system32\\drivers folder. A file\ncalled WimBootConfigurations.ini is also dropped; this file has the command for following the\nCOM hijack. Finally, the malware adds the hijack DLL to a COM class registry key,\noverwriting the legitimate COM DLL path that was there, achieving persistence via COM\nhijacking.\n\nFrom the COM hijacking, the DevilsTongue first-stage hijack DLL gets loaded into a\n_svchost.exe process to run with SYSTEM permissions. The COM hijacking technique means_\nthat the original DLL that was in the COM registry key isn’t loaded. This can break system\nfunctionality and trigger an investigation that could lead to the discovery of the malware, but\nDevilsTongue uses an interesting technique to avoid this. In its DllMain function it calls\n_LoadLibrary on the original COM DLL so it is correctly loaded into the process. DevilsTongue_\nthen searches the call stack to find the return address of LoadLibraryExW (i.e., the function\ncurrently loading the DevilsTongue DLL), which would usually return the base address of the\nDevilsTongue DLL.\n\nOnce the LoadLibraryExW return address has been found, DevilsTongue allocates a small\nbuffer with shellcode that puts the COM DLL’s base address (imecfmup.7FFE49060000 in\nFigure 1) into the rax register and then jumps to the original return address of\n_LoadLibraryExW (svchost.7FF78E903BFB in Figures 1 and 2). In Figure 1 the COM DLL is_\nnamed imecfmup rather than a legitimate COM DLL name because some DevilsTongue\nsamples copied the COM DLL to another location and renamed it.\n\n_Figure 1. DevilsTongue return address modification shellcode_\n\nDevilsTongue then swaps the original LoadLibraryExW return address on the stack with the\naddress of the shellcode so that when LoadLibraryExW returns it does so into the shellcode\n(Figures 2 and 3). The shellcode replaces the DevilsTongue base address in rax with the\nCOM DLL’s base address, making it look like LoadLibraryExW has returned the COM DLL’s\naddress. The svchost.exe host process now uses the returned COM DLL base address as it\nusually would.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Call stack before stack swap, LoadLibraryExW in kernelbase returning to_\n_svchost.exe (0x7FF78E903BFB)_\n\n_Figure 3. Call stack after stack swap, LoadLibraryExW in kernelbase returning to the_\n_shellcode address (0x156C51E0000 from Figure 1)_\n\nThis technique ensures that the DevilsTongue DLL is loaded by the svchost.exe process,\ngiving the malware persistence, but that the legitimate COM DLL is also loaded correctly so\nthere’s no noticeable change in functionality on the victim’s systems.\n\nAfter this, the hijack DLL then decrypts and loads a second-stage malware DLL from one of\nthe encrypted .dat files. The second-stage malware decrypts another .dat file that contains\nmultiple helper DLLs that it relies on for functionality.\n\nDevilsTongue has standard malware capabilities, including file collection, registry querying,\nrunning WMI commands, and querying SQLite databases. It’s capable of stealing victim\ncredentials from both LSASS and from browsers, such as Chrome and Firefox. It also has\n[dedicated functionality to decrypt and exfiltrate conversations from the Signal messaging](https://signal.org/)\napp.\n\nIt can retrieve cookies from a variety of web browsers. These stolen cookies can later be\nused by the attacker to sign in as the victim to websites to enable further information\ngathering. Cookies can be collected from these paths (* is a wildcard to match any folders):\n\n_%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Chromium\\User Data\\*\\Cookies_\n_%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\*\\Cookies_\n_%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCookies_\n_%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Packages\\*\\AC\\*\\MicrosoftEdge\\Cookies_\n_%LOCALAPPDATA%\\UCBrowser\\User Data_i18n\\*\\Cookies.9_\n_%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Yandex\\YandexBrowser\\User Data\\*\\Cookies_\n_%APPDATA%\\Apple Computer\\Safari\\Cookies\\Cookies.binarycookies_\n_%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Cookies_\n_%APPDATA%\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\*\\cookies.sqlite_\n_%APPDATA%\\Opera Software\\Opera Stable\\Cookies_\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, DevilsTongue seems able to use cookies directly from the victim s computer on\nwebsites such as Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Yahoo, Mail.ru, Odnoklassniki, and Vkontakte to\ncollect information, read the victim’s messages, and retrieve photos. DevilsTongue can also\nsend messages as the victim on some of these websites, appearing to any recipient that the\nvictim had sent these messages. The capability to send messages could be weaponized to\nsend malicious links to more victims.\n\nAlongside DevilsTongue a third-party signed driver is dropped to\n_C:\\Windows\\system32\\drivers\\physmem.sys. The driver’s description is “Physical Memory_\nAccess Driver,” and it appears to offer a “by-design” kernel read/write capability. This\nappears to be abused by DevilsTongue to proxy certain API calls via the kernel to hinder\ndetection, including the capability to have some of the calls appear from other processes.\nFunctions capable of being proxied include CreateProcessW, VirtualAllocEx,\n_VirtualProtectEx, WriteProcessMemory, ReadProcessMemory, CreateFileW and_\n_RegSetKeyValueW._\n\n## Prevention and detection\n\nTo prevent compromise from browser exploits, it’s recommended to use an isolated\nenvironment, such as a virtual machine, when opening links from untrusted parties. Using a\nmodern version of Windows 10 with virtualization-based protections, such as Credential\nGuard, prevents DevilsTongue’s LSASS credential-stealing capabilities. Enabling the attack\n[surface reduction rule “Block abuse of exploited vulnerable signed drivers” in Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction?view=o365-worldwide#block-abuse-of-exploited-vulnerable-signed-drivers)\n[Defender for Endpoint blocks the driver that DevilsTongue uses. Network protection blocks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/network-protection?view=o365-worldwide)\nknown SOURGUM domains.\n\n### Detection opportunities\n\nThis section is intended to serve as a non-exhaustive guide to help customers and peers in\nthe cybersecurity industry to detect the DevilsTongue malware. We’re providing this guidance\nwith the expectation that SOURGUM will likely change the characteristics we identify for\ndetection in their next iteration of the malware. Given the actor’s level of sophistication,\nhowever, we believe that outcome would likely occur irrespective of our public guidance.\n\n**File locations**\n\nThe hijack DLLs are in subfolders of \\system32\\ime\\ with names starting with ‘im’. However,\nthey are blended with legitimate DLLs in those folders. To distinguish between the malicious\nand benign, the legitimate DLLs are signed (on Windows 10) whereas the DevilsTongue files\naren’t. Example paths:\n\n_C:\\Windows\\System32\\IME\\IMEJP\\imjpueact.dll_\n_C:\\Windows\\system32\\ime\\IMETC\\IMTCPROT.DLL_\n_C:\\Windows\\system32\\ime\\SHARED\\imecpmeid.dll_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DevilsTongue configuration files, which are AES-encrypted, are in subfolders of\n_C:\\Windows\\system32\\config\\ and have a .dat extension. The exact paths are victim-specific,_\nalthough some folder names are common across victims. As the files are AES-encrypted,\nany files whose size mod 16 is 0 can be considered as a possible malware config file. The\nconfig files are always in new folders, not the legitimate existing folders (e.g., on Windows\n10, never in \\Journal, \\systemprofile, \\TxR etc.). Example paths:\n\n_C:\\Windows\\system32\\config\\spp\\ServiceState\\Recovery\\pac.dat_\n_C:\\Windows\\system32\\config\\cy-GB\\Setup\\SKB\\InputMethod\\TupTask.dat_\n_C:\\Windows\\system32\\config\\config\\startwus.dat_\n\nCommonly reused folder names in the config file paths:\n\n_spp_\n_SKB_\n_curv_\n_networklist_\n_Licenses_\n_InputMethod_\n_Recovery_\n\nThe .ini reg file has the unique name WimBootConfigurations.ini and is in a subfolder of\n_system32\\ime\\. Example paths:_\n\n_C:\\Windows\\system32\\ime\\SHARED\\WimBootConfigurations.ini_\n_C:\\Windows\\system32\\ime\\IMEJP\\WimBootConfigurations.ini_\n_C:\\Windows\\system32\\ime\\IMETC\\WimBootConfigurations.ini_\n\nThe Physmem driver is dropped into system32:\n\n_C:\\Windows\\system32\\drivers\\physmem.sys_\n\n**Behaviors**\n\nThe two COM keys that have been observed being hijacked for persistence are listed below\nwith their default clean values.
