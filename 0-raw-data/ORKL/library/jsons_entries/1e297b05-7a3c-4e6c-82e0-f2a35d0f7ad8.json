    "plain_text": "# New PatchWork Spearphishing Attack\n\n**lab52.io/blog/new-patchwork-campaign-against-pakistan/**\n\nRecently, a somewhat more elaborated phishing has caught our attention at Lab52, it\nconsists on a malicious office document of a real article from Samaa.tv published on 07-102019, one of the most important media in Pakistan. The article used in this campaign is\nrelated to the current rise of tension in the geopolitical Indian-Pakistani conflict with Kashmir.\nThe headline of the article is: “India to become center of extremism under Modi: AJK PM”\n([1]).\n\nIllustration 1: Headlines used in the Campaign\nThe document, with name “India’s_Extremisms_Under_Mobi.docx” and hash\n“167062593cb9e42a404dc9c8a0347e74888712a1256731724417e6f1d411cbbb” was written\nin English, an official language for both countries. The startling headline selected in the\ncampaign tries to attract the attention and interest of the Pakistani and Indian people through\nthe social fear. So the main target would be more focused to the Pakistani victims to\ndownload the malicious document. At the moment, Delhi and Islamabad claim the control of\nthe whole Kashmir area. However, each public administration manage a concrete area of the\nregion ([2]) ([3]).\n\n\n-----\n\nIllustration 2: External Kashmir’s influence\n\nChina is also involved in this geopolitical scenario as China is carrying out an important\ninvestment in Pakistan, especially in the “China-Pakistan Economic Corridor”. A public officer\nfrom Beijing declared that if there is any unacceptable geostrategic movement from India,\nChina would defend the legal right of Pakistan in the Kashmir’s area ([3]).\n\nIllustration 3: China Pakistan Economic\n\ncorridor\nThe economic and trade geopolitical interests of China in Pakistan are highly relevant.\nCurrently, it is relevant the investments of China in Pakistan to keep developing the China &\nPakistan economic which will join to the OBOR’s route until the Gwadar and Karachi Port\n\n\n-----\n\n([4]). The Indian claim to control of the whole Kashmir area, means an important approach of\nIndia to the Economic Corridor of China-Pakistan, this geopolitical situation provokes\ndiscomfort to both partners as their logistical project would be in danger to be disrupted. As it\nis showed; China, Pakistan and India are showing more interests in the Kashmir area.\n\nThe document appeared in public sources around 15-10-2019 and the internal data of the\ndocument dates from the 12-10-2019 so it seems a recent campaign. When the document is\nopened, the MSOffice Word editor process is constantly suspended and acts in an unstable\nway. Analyzing in depth the document, it can be observed that it contains a file called\nimage1.eps that corresponds to a Flash element of the document that exploits the adobe\nFlash vulnerability known as “CVE-2017-0261”.\n\nIllustration 4: Dropped files by the document\nThe exploit executed by the document contains a shellcode that dumps into the folder\n“C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\DeviceSync” 3 executable files, two of them related to VMWare,\nand one named “MSBuild.exe”. After creating these files, the shellcode runs the binary\nnamed “VMWareCplLauncher.exe”..\n\nAs described in this Unit42 report [6], the executable “VMWareCplLauncher.exe” is a signed\nbinary from VMWare and the DLL is also a legitimate part of VMWare, which is automatically\nloaded by the executable, and has been modified to create in this case two scheduled tasks:\n\nIllustration 5: Tasks created by VMWareCplLauncher.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nIllustration 6: Second binary path\nThe first task, points to the yet seen executable “MSBuild.exe” and the second to a binary\nthat isn’t generated at any time of the infection and that could point to a next stage of\ninfection that may be downloaded after a “recon” of the infected machine made by this fist\nstage. After a minute, the task programmed with the name “Windows Update…” launches\nthe MSBuild.exe binary, which consists of a first stage trojan, with a multitude of capabilities\ndescribed below.\n\nThis sample contacts the domain “yetwq.twilightparadox.com” through the HTTP protocol to\nwhich constantly sends information collected from the victim computer, together with the\nparameter “crc=e3a6” which is “hardcoded” in its logic.\n\nIllustration 7: Malware traffic with it’s C2\nThe response of the server is checked in its logic, in search of one of the following numbers\n“4, 5, 8, 13, 23, 33” which correspond to different commands related to the download and\nexecution of other binaries, keyboard monitoring, sending screenshots to the command and\ncontrol server or theft of files with the following list of extensions:\n“doc:docx:pdf:ppt:pptx:jpg:jpeg:png:rtf:txt:7z:rar:zip:docm:msg:wps:xps:pptm”.\n\n\n-----\n\nIllustration 8: Command switch/case on the sample\nBoth its capabilities and its code are practically the same as those described by Unit42 in\nreference to the BadNews threat. In the same way, the TTPs of the entire infection chain\ncoincide with those described in several reports in relation to campaigns that have been\nattributed to the Patchwork group also known as “Dropping Elephant” or “APT-C-09”.\n\nFurthermore, due to the characteristics of the campaign and the current geopolitical scenario\nin the area, it seems that its main targets could be located in Pakistan and would be linked to\nthe Chinese-Pakistani Economic Corridor (CPEC) route.\n\nIOCs:\n\n167062593cb9e42a404dc9c8a0347e74888712a1256731724417e6f1d411cbbb\n\n6b656dc98773255cbc3592122db6487326e39b8e01966cca174dde87e72f82ec\n\n5f5a1af57872610aa692ee3d0fba4a0171c2ec1a8cc3cf45f21f52caa2ab9041\n\n31c913899d50d78f2d7d9657e7534bd36819ec9571566216f1c963bf605417f7\n\nyetwq.twilightparadox.com\n\n185.161.208.252\n\nReferences:\n\n\n-----\n\n[1] https://www.samaa.tv/news/2019/10/india-to-become-center-of-extremism-under-modiajk-pm/\n\n[2] [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49737886](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49737886)\n\n[3] [https://www.dw.com/en/pakistan-thanks-china-for-support-on-kashmir-issue/a-50745277](https://www.dw.com/en/pakistan-thanks-china-for-support-on-kashmir-issue/a-50745277)\n\n[4]https://www.dw.com/en/belt-and-road-forum-is-the-china-pakistan-economic-corridorfailing/a-48473486\n\n[5] [https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0040/](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0040/)\n\n[6] https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-patchwork-continues-deliver-badnews-indiansubcontinent/\n\n\n-----",
