See the_ _[ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v8/techniques/enterprise/)_\n_actor tactics and techniques._\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) are aware of a ransomware attack affecting a critical infrastructure (CI)\nentity—a pipeline company—in the United States. Malicious cyber actors deployed DarkSide\n[ransomware against the pipeline company’s information technology (IT) network.[1] At this](https://www.colpipe.com/news/press-releases/media-statement-colonial-pipeline-system-disruption)\ntime, there is no indication that the entity’s operational technology (OT) networks have been\ndirectly affected by the ransomware.\n\nCISA and FBI urge CI asset owners and operators to adopt a heightened state of awareness\nand implement the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this Joint\nCybersecurity Advisory, including implementing robust network segmentation between IT and\nOT networks; regularly testing manual controls; and ensuring that backups are implemented,\nregularly tested, and isolated from network connections. These mitigations will help CI\nowners and operators improve their entity's functional resilience by reducing their\nvulnerability to ransomware and the risk of severe business degradation if impacted by\nransomware.\n\n**(Updated May 19, 2021):** Click here for a STIX package of indicators of compromise\n(IOCs). Note: These IOCs were shared with critical infrastructure partners and network\ndefenders on May 10, 2021. The applications listed in the IOCs were leveraged by the\nthreat actors during the course of a compromise. Some of these applications might\nappear within an organization's enterprise to support legitimate purposes; however,\nthese applications can be used by threat actors to aid in malicious exploitation of an\norganization's enterprise. CISA and FBI recommend removing any application not\ndeemed necessary for day-to-day operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**[(Updated July 08, 2021): Click here for downloadable IOCs associated with a sample](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10337802-1.v1.WHITE_stix.xml)**\nof a DarkSide ransomware variant analyzed by CISA and FBI. Note: CISA and FBI\nhave no evidence that this sample is related to the pipeline incident detailed in this\nCSA. This variant executes a dynamic-link library (DLL) program used to delete\nVolume Shadow copies available on the system. The malware collects, encrypts, and\nsends system information to the threat actor’s command and control (C2) domains and\ngenerates a ransom note to the victim. For more information about this variant, refer to\n[Malware Analysis Report MAR-10337802-1.v1: DarkSide Ransomware.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-189a)\n\n[Click here for a PDF version of this report.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA21-131A_Darkside_Ransomware.pdf)\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**_Note: the analysis in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory is ongoing, and the information_**\n_provided should not be considered comprehensive. CISA and FBI will update this advisory_\n_as new information is available._\n\nAfter gaining initial access to the pipeline company’s network, DarkSide actors deployed\nDarkSide ransomware against the company’s IT network. In response to the cyberattack, the\ncompany has reported that they proactively disconnected certain OT systems to ensure\n[the systems’ safety.[2] At this time, there are no indications that the threat actor moved](https://www.colpipe.com/news/press-releases/media-statement-colonial-pipeline-system-disruption)\nlaterally to OT systems.\n\nDarkSide is ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)—the developers of the ransomware receive a\nshare of the proceeds from the cybercriminal actors who deploy it, known as\n“affiliates.” According to open-source reporting, since August 2020, DarkSide actors have\nbeen targeting multiple large, high-revenue organizations, resulting in the encryption and\ntheft of sensitive data. The DarkSide group has publicly stated that they prefer to target\norganizations that can afford to pay large ransoms instead of hospitals, schools, non-profits,\n[and governments.[3],[4]](https://securitynews.sonicwall.com/xmlpost/darkside-ransomware-targets-large-corporations-charges-up-to-2m/)\n\nAccording to open-source reporting, DarkSide actors have previously been observed gaining\ninitial access through phishing and exploiting remotely accessible accounts and systems and\n[Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) (Phishing [T1566], Exploit Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1566/)\n\n[[T1190], External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1190/) [[T1133]).[5],[6] DarkSide actors have also been observed](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1133/)\nusing Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to maintain Persistence [[TA0003].[7]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0003/)\n\nAfter gaining access, DarkSide actors deploy DarkSide ransomware to encrypt and steal\nsensitive data (Data Encrypted for Impact [[T1486]). The actors then threaten to publicly](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)\n[release the data if the ransom is not paid.[8],[9] The DarkSide ransomware uses Salsa20](https://securitynews.sonicwall.com/xmlpost/darkside-ransomware-targets-large-corporations-charges-up-to-2m/)\n[and RSA encryption.[10]](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/threat-center/threat-landscape-dashboard/ransomware-details.darkside-ransomware.html)\n\n[DarkSide actors primarily use The Onion Router (TOR) for Command and Control (C2)](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0183/)\n\n[[TA0011] (Proxy: Multi-hop Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0011/) [[1090.003]).[11],[12] The actors have also been observed](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1090/003/)\n[using Cobalt Strike for C2 [13]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/software/S0154/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mitigations\n\nCISA and FBI urge CI owners and operators to apply the following mitigations to reduce the\nrisk of compromise by ransomware attacks.\n\n**Require multi-factor authentication for remote access to OT and IT networks.**\n**Enable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users.**\nFilter emails containing executable files from reaching end users.\n**Implement a user training program and simulated attacks for spearphishing to**\ndiscourage users from visiting malicious websites or opening malicious attachments\nand re-enforce the appropriate user responses to spearphishing emails.\n**Filter network traffic to prohibit ingress and egress communications with known**\nmalicious IP addresses. Prevent users from accessing malicious websites by\nimplementing URL blocklists and/or allowlists.\n**Update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware on IT**\nnetwork assets, in a timely manner. Consider using a centralized patch management\nsystem; use a risk-based assessment strategy to determine which OT network assets\nand zones should participate in the patch management program.\n**Limit access to resources over networks, especially by restricting RDP. After**\nassessing risks, if RDP is deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating\nsources and require multi-factor authentication.\n**Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets**\nusing up-to-date signatures. Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine\nhow OT network assets are identified and evaluated for the presence of malware.\n**Implement unauthorized execution prevention by:**\n\n**Disabling macro scripts from Microsoft Office files transmitted via email.**\nConsider using Office Viewer software to open Microsoft Office files transmitted\nvia email instead of full Microsoft Office suite applications.\n**Implementing application allowlisting, which only allows systems to execute**\nprograms known and permitted by security policy. Implement software restriction\npolicies (SRPs) or other controls to prevent programs from executing from\ncommon ransomware locations, such as temporary folders supporting popular\ninternet browsers or compression/decompression programs, including the\n```\n      AppData/LocalAppData folder.\n\n```\n**Monitor and/or block inbound connections from Tor exit nodes and other**\n**anonymization services to IP addresses and ports for which external**\nconnections are not expected (i.e., other than VPN gateways, mail ports, web\nports). For more guidance, refer to Joint Cybersecurity Advisory AA20-183A:\nDefending Against Malicious Cyber Activity Originating from Tor.\n**Deploy signatures to detect and/or block inbound connection from Cobalt**\n**Strike servers and other post exploitation tools.**\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA and FBI urge CI owners and operators to apply the following mitigations now to reduce\nthe risk of severe business or functional degradation should their CI entity fall victim to a\nransomware attack in the future.\n\n**Implement and ensure robust network segmentation between IT and OT**\n**networks to limit the ability of adversaries to pivot to the OT network even if the IT**\nnetwork is compromised. Define a demilitarized zone that eliminates unregulated\ncommunication between the IT and OT networks.\n**Organize OT assets into logical zones by taking into account criticality,**\nconsequence, and operational necessity. Define acceptable communication conduits\nbetween the zones and deploy security controls to filter network traffic and monitor\ncommunications between zones. Prohibit industrial control system (ICS) protocols from\ntraversing the IT network.\n**Identify OT and IT network inter-dependencies and develop workarounds or**\n**manual controls to ensure ICS networks can be isolated if the connections create risk**\nto the safe and reliable operation of OT processes. Regularly test contingency plans\nsuch as manual controls so that safety critical functions can be maintained during a\ncyber incident. Ensure that the OT network can operate at necessary capacity even if\nthe IT network is compromised.\n**Regularly test manual controls so that critical functions can be kept running if ICS or**\nOT networks need to be taken offline.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Implement regular data backup procedures on both the IT and OT networks.**\nBackup procedures should be conducted on a frequent, regular basis. The data backup\nprocedures should also address the following best practices:\n\n**Ensure that backups are regularly tested.**\n**Store your backups separately. Backups should be isolated from network**\nconnections that could enable the spread of ransomware. It is important that\nbackups be maintained offline as many ransomware variants attempt to find and\nencrypt or delete accessible backups. Maintaining current backups offline is\ncritical because if your network data is encrypted with ransomware, your\norganization can restore systems to its previous state. Best practice is to store\nyour backups on a separate device that cannot be accessed from a network,\nsuch as on an external hard drive. (See the Software Engineering Institute’s page\non [ransomware).](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2017/05/ransomware-best-practices-for-prevention-and-response.html)\n**Maintain regularly updated “gold images” of critical systems in the event**\n**they need to be rebuilt. This entails maintaining image “templates” that include**\na preconfigured operating system (OS) and associated software applications that\ncan be quickly deployed to rebuild a system, such as a virtual machine or server.\n**Retain backup hardware to rebuild systems in the event rebuilding the primary**\nsystem is not preferred. Hardware that is newer or older than the primary system\ncan present installation or compatibility hurdles when rebuilding from images.\n**Store source code or executables. It is more efficient to rebuild from system**\nimages, but some images will not install on different hardware or platforms\ncorrectly; having separate access to needed software will help in these cases.\n**Ensure user and process accounts are limited through account use policies,**\n**user account control, and privileged account management. Organize access rights**\nbased on the principles of least privilege and separation of duties.\n\nIf your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, CISA and FBI recommend the\nfollowing actions:\n\n**Isolate the infected system. Remove the infected system from all networks, and**\ndisable the computer’s wireless, Bluetooth, and any other potential networking\ncapabilities. Ensure all shared and networked drives are disconnected, whether wired\nor wireless.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Turn off other computers and devices. Power-off and segregate (i.e., remove from**\nthe network) the infected computer(s). Power-off and segregate any other computers or\ndevices that shared a network with the infected computer(s) that have not been fully\nencrypted by ransomware. If possible, collect and secure all infected and potentially\ninfected computers and devices in a central location, making sure to clearly label any\ncomputers that have been encrypted. Powering-off and segregating infected computers\nand computers that have not been fully encrypted may allow for the recovery of\npartially encrypted files by specialists. (See Before You Connect a New Computer to\nthe Internet for tips on how to make a computer more secure before you reconnect it to\na network.)\n**Secure your backups. Ensure that your backup data is offline and secure. If possible,**\nscan your backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of malware.\nRefer to Joint Cybersecurity Advisory: AA20-245A: Technical Approaches to\nUncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity for more best practices on incident\nresponse.\n\n**Note: CISA and the FBI do not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a**\nransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other\ncriminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities.\nPaying the ransom also does not guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered. CISA and\n[FBI urge you to report ransomware incidents to your local FBI field office.](http://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field)\n\n[CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help CI organizations assess,](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services)\nidentify and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware.
