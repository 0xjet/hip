location\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/newly-found-android-malware-records-audio-tracks-your-location/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/newly-found-android-malware-records-audio-tracks-your-location/)**\n\nBill Toulas\n\nBy\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nApril 1, 2022\n03:41 PM\n0\n\nA previously unknown Android malware uses the same shared-hosting infrastructure\npreviously seen used by the Russian APT group known as Turla, though attribution to the\nhacking group not possible.\n\n[Turla is a Russian state-supported hacking group known for using custom malware to target](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-state-hackers-use-new-tinyturla-malware-as-secondary-backdoor/)\n[European and American systems, primarily for espionage.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-turla-hackers-breach-european-government-organization/)\n\n[The threat actors have recently been linked to the Sunburst backdoor used in](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sunburst-backdoor-shares-features-with-russian-apt-malware/)\nthe [SolarWinds supply-chain attack in December 2020.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-solarwinds-cyberattack-the-hack-the-victims-and-what-we-know/)\n\n## New Android spyware discovered\n\n\n-----\n\n[Researchers from Lab52 identified a malicious APK [VirusTotal] named Process Manager](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e0eacd72afe39de3b327a164f9c69a78c9c0f672d3ad202271772d816db4fad8)\nthat acts as Android spyware, uploading information to the threat actors.\n\nWhile it is not clear how the spyware is distributed, once installed, Process Manager\nattempts to hide on an Android device using a gear-shaped icon, pretending to be a system\ncomponent.\n\nUpon its first launch, the app prompts the user to allow it to use the following 18\npermissions:\n\nAccess coarse location\nAccess fine location\nAccess network state\nAccess WiFi state\nCamera\nForeground service\nInternet\nModify audio settings\nRead call log\nRead contacts\nRead external storage\nWrite external storage\nRead phone state\nRead SMS\nReceive boot completed\nRecord audio\nSend SMS\nWake log\n\nThese permissions are a serious risk to privacy as it allows the app to get a device's\nlocation, send and read texts, access storage, take pictures with the camera, and record\naudio.\n\nIt is unclear if the malware abuses the Android Accessibility service to grant itself\npermissions or if it's tricking the user into approving a request.\n\nAfter receiving the permissions, the spyware removes its icon and runs in the background\nwith only a permanent notification indicating its presence.\n\n\n-----\n\n**The permanent notification**\n\n**posing as a system service**\n_(Lab52)_\nThis aspect is quite strange for spyware that should usually strive to remain hidden from the\nvictim, especially if this is the work of a sophisticated APT (advanced persistent threat)\ngroup.\n\nThe information collected by the device, including lists, logs, SMS, recordings, and event\nnotifications, are sent in JSON format to the command and control server at\n82.146.35[.]240, which is located in Russia.\n\n**Establishing**\n\n**C2 connection to send the stolen data** _(Lab52)_\nThe method of distribution for the APK is unknown, but if it is Turla, they commonly use\nsocial engineering, phishing, watering hole attacks, etc., so it could be anything.\n\n## Strange case of abuse for profit\n\n[While researching the app, the Lab52 team also found that it downloads additional payloads](http://lab52.io/blog/complete-dissection-of-an-apk-with-a-suspicious-c2-server/)\nto the device and found a case of an app fetched directly from the Play Store.\n\nThe app is named \"Roz Dhan: Earn Wallet cash,\" and it's a popular (10,000,000 downloads)\napp featuring a money-generating referral system.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Abused application on the Play Store**\nThe spyware reportedly downloads the APK via the app's referral system, likely to earn a\ncommission, which is somewhat strange given that the particular actor is focused on cyber\nespionage.\n\nThis, in addition to the seemingly unsophisticated implementation of the Android spyware,\nleads us to believe that the C2 analyzed by Lab52 may be part of a shared infrastructure.\n\nState actors are known for following this tactic, even if rarely, as it helps them obscure their\ntrace and confuse analysts.\n\nHowever, due to the low sophistication of the malware's threat capabilities and the use of\nreferral-based monetization, the researchers do not believe this to be the work of a nationstate actor, like Turla.\n\n\"So in this report, we want to share our analysis on the capabilities of this piece of malware,\nalthough the attribution to Turla does not seem possible given its threat capabilities,\"\nexplain the Lab52 researchers.\n\n## Keep malware out\n\n\n-----\n\nUsers of Android devices are advised to review the app permissions they have granted,\nwhich should be fairly easy on versions from Android 10 and later, and revoke those that\nappear overly risky.\n\nAlso, starting from Android 12, the OS pushes indications when the camera or microphone\nis active, so if these appear orphaned, spyware is hiding in your device.\n\nThese tools are particularly dangerous when nesting inside IoTs that run older Android\nversions, generating money for their remote operators for prolonged periods without anyone\nrealizing the compromise.\n\n_Update 4/3/22: Article and title updated to show more clearly that the link with Turla APT is_\n_based on weak evidence._\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[FluBot Android malware
