Based on a blog by 360 Core Security, we observed PJobRAT spyware samples disguised as](https://blogs.360.cn/post/analysis-of-PJobRAT.html)\ngenuine dating and instant-messaging apps.\n\nOur research was in line with the findings of 360 Core Security, and we found the spyware disguising as a famous dating app for Non-resident\nIndians called Trendbanter and an instant messaging app called Signal. PJobRAT is a variant of spyware that disguises as a dating app\nor an instant messaging app. It collects information such as contacts, SMSes, and GPS data. This RAT family first appeared in December\n2019. PJobRAT is named after the structure of its code, which involves functions called ‘startJob’ or ‘initJob’ that initiate the malicious activity.\n\nBased on a [post on Twitter, the Cyble Research team came to know of 8 associated samples of the variant.](https://twitter.com/blackorbird/status/1404752748919156737?s=20)\n\n_Figure 1: Trendbanter App_\n\nThe malicious apps were seen using legitimate-looking icons of the genuine Trendbanter and Signal apps.\n\n_Figure 2: Malware Impersonating as Trendbanter and Signal Apps_\n\nUpon further analysis, we found that PJobRAT is being displayed as a legitimate-looking WhatsApp icon on\nthe device’s home screen. However, the settings page clearly reveals the Trendbanner icon of the PJobRAT spyware app.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 PJobRAT Spyware App Tricks Users with WhatsApp Icon_\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nAll the associated samples of PJobRAT have dangerous permissions for spying on the victim’s device. The application collects personally\nidentifiable information (PII) available in the victim’s device without the user’s knowledge and uploads the same to a C&C server. The malicious\nactivity starts immediately after the user starts the application. As showcased in figure 3, the application uses icons of legitimate apps to\nhide itself from the home screen.\n\n**Dangerous Permissions**\n\nandroid.permission.READ_CONTACTS\n\nandroid.permission.READ_SMS\n\nandroid.permission.RECORD_AUDIO\n\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\n\nandroid.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\n\nandroid.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS\n\nandroid.permission.BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE\n\nThe PJobRAT starts the malicious activity as soon as the user clicks on the application icon. The activity is initiated using initJobs function from\nthe application subclass that gets executed when the application starts, as shown in Figure 4.\n\n_Figure 4: Jobs Initiated in Applications Subclass_\n\nThe image below showcases the code through which sensitive PII is collected by the PJobRAT, along with the\nprocess initiated by the Android JobService.\n\n_Figure 5 Initiating Different Jobs to Collect PII data_\n\nThe following image shows the code that harvests the victim’s Contact List information from the Address Book.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 Contact List Collected from Address Book_\n\nAs shown in Figure 7, the application collects selective documents with specific suffixes and uploads it to the C&C server.\n\n_Figure 7 Filters for Specific Document Format_\n\nThe application also collects all the media files such as audio, video, and images available in the device, as shown in Figure 8.\n\n_Figure 8 Collect media files such as Audio, Video, and Images_\n\nPJobRAT also uses the BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE to hook the Android window for reading the information associated\nwith WhatsApp such as WhatsApp contacts and messages, as shown in Figure 9.\n\n_Figure 9 Reading and Collecting WhatsApp Data_\n\n**Communication Details**\n\n\n-----\n\nOu esea c d cates t at Job uses t o odes o co u cat o, ebase C oud essag g ( C ) a d e app cat o\nreceives commands from Firebase, as shown in Figure 10.\n\n_Figure 10 Firebase Interaction to receive Commands_\n\nFigure 11 depicts the code with which the application uploads the collected data using HTTP to the C&C server.\n\n_Figure 11 Uploading the Data using HTTP_\n\nRetrofit is another library that is used by some of the samples of PJobRAT for uploading user data.\n\n_Figure 12 Retrofit for C&C server Communication_\n\nOur analysis shows that PJobRAT uploads the following information from the victim device to the C&C server:\n\nContacts information\nSMSes\nAudio and video files\nList of installed applications\nList of external storage files\nDocuments such as PDFs, Excel, and DOC files\nWiFi and GPS information\nWhatsApp contacts and messages\n\nAll of the analyzed samples have the same code format and communicate with the same C&C server URLs. The C&C URLs are mentioned in\nthe below table.\n\n**PJobRAT C&C URLs**\n\n\n-----\n\n# **Digest (SHA256)** **Package name** **Upload URL**\n\n1 5c715ca910ffbd80189cffd2705a5346f40bc466458e0223191d56be5a417c7b com.company.test hxxp://144.91.65[.]101/sen\n\n2 e8f9b778b87cef1d767a77cb99401875ffdbcc85b345f31a4b4e1b7003218f3f com.test.piclock hxxp://144.91.65[.]101/sen\n\n3 80baa403def61ad0c7ba712595a90a44049464341de0d880c57823dbe9d27c94 si.test.hangonv4e hxxp://gemtool.sytes[.]net\n3cMV/sjdf578hj_p-lm235_\nq/sjdf0oO2hq877pnzxii_iio\n\n4 04366d01542cba82787433d0d565c13b227a08fc6657bcb34269de48e452543a dev.example.trendbanternew hxxp://gemtool.sytes[.]net\n3cMV/sjdf578hj_p-lm235_\nq/sjdf0oO2hq877pnzxii_iio\n\n5 34021375c1720620093699fd98ca2a2856ef4c77f42ff5c8fb02ad194817a235 org.company.hangonv3 hxxp://gemtool.sytes[.]net\n3cMV/sjdf578hj_p-lm235_\nq/sjdf0oO2hq877pnzxii_iio\n\n6 41576737cd3d9f1e04ca0b7d49b412ecc935da78b2ea007c92b84d85012b011e com.company.hangon hxxp://gemtool.sytes[.]net\n3cMV/sjdf578hj_p-lm235_\nq/sjdf0oO2hq877pnzxii_iio\n\n7 c9db17ede3177c6fd13fa90259733dbca9be8fbd43f0059efd6ec35acbda2b48 si.test.hangonv4e hxxp://gemtool.sytes[.]net\n3cMV/sjdf578hj_p-lm235_\nq/sjdf0oO2hq877pnzxii_iio\n\n8 f491e27644a85915a1f92314c20e9fc63337a019f9463d34df262699d0a8a7ee com.simple.ppapp hxxps://helloworld.bounce\n\nBased on speculations by 360 Core Security, the PJobRAT spyware is allegedly targeting military professionals using dating apps and instant\nmessaging apps. In the past, military personnel have been victims of social engineering campaigns launched by crafty cybercriminals. In\naddition, as a result of the latest privacy policy update by WhatsApp, the use of the Signal app has increased in India. We suspect that the\nthreat actor has leveraged this situation as an opportunity to deliver malicious applications. The Cyble research team is actively monitoring this\ncampaign and any activity around PJobRAT spyware.\n\n**Safety Recommendations:**\n\nKeep your anti-virus software updated to detect and remove malicious software.\nKeep your system and applications updated to the latest versions.\nUse strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.\nDownload and install software only from trusted sites.\nVerify the privileges and permissions requested by apps before granting them access.\nPeople concerned about the exposure of their stolen credentials in the dark web can register at [AmiBreached.com to ascertain their](https://amibreached.com/)\nexposure.\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK® Techniques- for Mobile**\n\n**Tactic** **Technique ID** **Technique Name**\n\n\nDefense\nEvasion\n\nCredential\nAccess\n\n\n[T1406,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1406) [T1418](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1418) Obfuscated Files or Information Application Discovery\n\n[T1412,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1412) [T1409](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1409) Capture SMS Messages Access Stored Application Data\n\n\nCollection [T1429,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1429) [T1507,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1507) [T1432,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1432) [T1430,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1430) [T1412,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1412) [T1409](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1409) Capture Audio Network Information Discovery Access Contact List Location\nTracking Capture SMS Messages Access Stored Application Data\n\n\nCommand and\nControl\n\n\n[T1573,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573) [T1571](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571) Encrypted Channel Non-Standard Port\n\n\nDiscovery [T1421,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1421) [T1418,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1418) [T1426,](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1426) [T1424](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1424) System Network Connections Discovery Application Discovery System\nInformation Discovery Process Discovery\n\nImpact [T1447](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1447) Delete Device Data Carrier Billing Fraud\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**\n\n**IOCs** **IOC type**\n\n5c715ca910ffbd80189cffd2705a5346f40bc466458e0223191d56be5a417c7b SHA256\n\ne8f9b778b87cef1d767a77cb99401875ffdbcc85b345f31a4b4e1b7003218f3f SHA256\n\n80baa403def61ad0c7ba712595a90a44049464341de0d880c57823dbe9d27c94 SHA256\n\n\n-----\n\n04366d01542cba82787433d0d565c13b227a08fc6657bcb34269de48e452543a SHA256\n\n34021375c1720620093699fd98ca2a2856ef4c77f42ff5c8fb02ad194817a235 SHA256\n\n41576737cd3d9f1e04ca0b7d49b412ecc935da78b2ea007c92b84d85012b011e SHA256\n\nc9db17ede3177c6fd13fa90259733dbca9be8fbd43f0059efd6ec35acbda2b48 SHA256\n\nf491e27644a85915a1f92314c20e9fc63337a019f9463d34df262699d0a8a7ee SHA256\n\nhxxp://144.91.65[.]101/senewteam2136/ Interesting URL\n\nhxxps://helloworld.bounceme[.]net/axbxcxdx123/ Interesting URL\n\nhxxp://gemtool.sytes[.]net:9863/shfppdlslfz_5699_hqp2o0o-3cMV/sjdf578hj_p-lm235_za0Oo-q/ Interesting URL\n\n144.91.65[.]101 Suspicious IP\n\n**About Cyble**\n\n[Cyble is a global threat intelligence SaaS provider that helps enterprises protect themselves from cybercrimes and exposure in](https://cyble.com/)\nthe darkweb.
