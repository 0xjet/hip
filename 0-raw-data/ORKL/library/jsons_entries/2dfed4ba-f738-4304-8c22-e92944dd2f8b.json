In this update, we take a closer look at the trends driving\nthe growth in these incidents.\n\n## The number of ransomware actors is increasing...\n\nThere has been a sharp increase in the number of ransomware operations this year,\nfollowing a trend already established in 2019. This is likely the result of the high profile of\nransomware incidents and, in cases where details of ransom payments have entered the\n\n\n-----\n\npublic domain, the perceived profitability of human-operated ransomware attacks. This is\nattracting new players into the market. Recent arrivals include the ransomware systems\nAvaddon, Darkside, Smaug and SunCrypt.\n\nThe growth in ransomware operations is not confined to new actors. Many established\ncriminal groups have already added ransomware to their portfolios. Banking trojans such as\nEmotet, Dridex and TrickBot are now more commonly used as the initial delivery mechanism\nin highly targeted ransomware attacks. The latest threat actor to make this switch is QakBot,\nwhich since March 2020 has been used in the delivery of ProLock and DoppelPaymer\nransomware.\n\nThe shift by established criminal actors towards ransomware is likely driven by opportunity\ncosts. Successful online banking attacks rely on complex money laundering operations to\nreceive stolen funds and transfer the proceeds to bank accounts under criminal control. The\nspecialist criminals who provide money laundering services demand high commissions,\nwhereas ransom payments are usually direct to cryptocurrency wallets already controlled by\nthe attackers. As a consequence, ransomware operations are almost certainly more\nprofitable than online banking attacks.\n\n## ...because the barriers to entry are dropping\n\nRansomware operations can be grouped into three broad categories: private schemes,\naffiliate programmes and builders.\n\nPrivate schemes\nAffiliate programmes\nRansomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)\n\n### Private schemes\n\nWe assess that several of the most significant ransomware threats, including Ryuk/Conti and\nWastedLocker, are run privately. They are operated by criminal enterprises whose leadership\nhas been active for over a decade and which comprise many of the most sophisticated and\nexperienced criminal actors we currently track.\n\nThese actors are largely secretive and do not participate in the criminal forums or\nmarketplaces frequented by less-established actors; instead, they either have all of the\nresources they need in-house, or where they do need to bring in external expertise, they\nemploy private communication channels to do so.\n\n### Affiliate programmes\n\nRansomware operators such as Sodinokibi, NetWalker and Nefilim are run as affiliate\nprogrammes. The threat actors are responsible for the development and management of the\nmalware They provide access to the ransomware to their affiliates whose role is to conduct\n\n\n-----\n\nattacks.\n\nThe funds extorted from victims are divided between the ransomware operators and their\naffiliates in pre-agreed, profit-sharing arrangements. This enables actors with network\nintrusion and exploitation skills to acquire access to ransomware capabilities they could not\neasily develop themselves, reducing the barriers to entry.\n\nLaunch of the NetWalker affiliate scheme in March 2020\n\n### Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)\n\nIn RaaS schemes, the developer sells access to the malware for a one-off fee. The products\nare usually marketed as “builders”, in that the purchaser can configure the ransomware\nthrough a graphic user interface (GUI) which then compiles the malware into a working\nbinary. In addition to a one-off fee, some RaaS schemes offer a subscription service which\nprovides users with “rebuilds” to reduce antivirus detections and/or updates when new\nfeatures become available.\n\nRansomware builder on sale in criminal forums\n\nRansomware builder on sale in criminal forums\n\nRaaS schemes are sold on criminal marketplaces and many are marketed as a better\nalternative to affiliate programmes: after the initial purchase is made, the actor keeps 100%\nof any revenue generated from their attacks. RaaS schemes have all but removed the entry\nbar to ransomware operations as all that is required to obtain a working malware package is\nthe funds to make the purchase and access to the criminal marketplaces where they are\nsold.\n\nIn general, RaaS actors tend to target SMEs, whereas affiliate programmes and private\nransomware operations are more likely to attack larger organisations. This is because RaaS\ncustomers often do not possess the requisite skills needed to attack and exploit large,\ncomplex networks.\n\n## Ransomware operations are scalable\n\nThe arrival of new ransomware groups, the proliferation of RaaS schemes and the fact that\nestablished criminal actors have added ransomware operations to their activities have all led\nto an increase in attacks. But another key factor is that many ransomware operations are\ninherently scalable. High-profile affiliate programmes like Sodinokibi and NetWalker have\nactively recruited new partners.\n\nThe income of affiliate programmes and the amount of attacks they are able to sustain are a\nfunction of the number and effectiveness of the affiliates that threat actors have recruited.\nThis has introduced a degree of competition between rival affiliate programmes, as they try\n\n\n-----\n\nto attract high-quality candidates to expand their operations. For example, the threat actor\ncontrolling Sodinokibi expects to retain 30-40% of the revenue generated by its affiliates,\nwhereas a selling point of the NetWalker scheme is that successful partners can retain 8090% of the proceeds of their attacks.\n\n## Established players are raising their game\n\nTwo of the most established and prominent ransomware threat actors have upgraded their\nsystems in 2020. BitPaymer, a ransomware variant operated by the threat actor with the selfstyled name “Evil Corp” (a.k.a. the Dridex Group), was first introduced in 2017. Although the\nthreat actor added some incremental improvements to the code, the core system has\nremained largely unchanged since its introduction. In 2020, “Evil Corp” launched a new\nransomware project known as WastedLocker, which was responsible for high profile attacks\nfrom the outset. Unlike BitPaymer, which was partially derived from the source code for the\nDridex banking trojan, WastedLocker has been written from scratch.\n\nRyuk, one of the most serious ransomware threats to organisations, was first introduced in\n2018. Ryuk operations were at a high tempo throughout 2019 which continued into Q1 of\n2020. Since then, a new ransomware variant known as Conti has emerged. Like\nWastedLocker, Conti has been written from scratch, but based on coding similarities and the\nnaming conventions used in files and commands, we assess it has been written by the threat\nactor in control of Ryuk.\n\nWe don't know why these high-level threat actors have introduced completely new systems,\nbut it is likely that the rapid growth in ransomware threats has resulted in some potential\ntargets having a better awareness of, and preparedness for, attacks. The threat actors have\ntherefore modernised their toolsets in an attempt to retain the initiative.\n\n## Data leaks have grown exponentially\n\n[As we noted in May, the actors in control of Maze ransomware began a trend by creating a](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/crisis-and-resilience/covid-19/why-an-increase-in-cyber-incidents-during-covid-19.html)\nsite where they posted data stolen from victims prior to the encryption of their files. The\npurpose of the leak site was to increase the level of coercion on new victims by making an\nexample of those who refused to pay Maze’s ransom demands.\n\nSince then, the number of actors with currently active leak sites has risen to 15 (or 18 if\ndiscontinued leak sites are also counted), including those in control of private ransomware\nsystems such as DoppelPaymer, Conti and CL0P. The rate and frequency of leaks has\ngrown rapidly, with 80% of data leaks occurring since the beginning of May.\n\nThere are risks associated with attempting to assess the level of threat posed by different\nransomware actors purely on the level of activity on their leak sites:\n\n\n-----\n\nLeak sites normally only display data on victims who have refused to accede to the\nattacker’s ransom demands, so it is impossible to gauge how successful individual\nactors are in coercing payments from victims;\nSome key ransomware actors, for example WastedLocker, do not use leak sites at all,\npreferring to operate beneath the radar. Others, such as ProLock are known to\nexfiltrate data but do not operate a leak site. However, some of these actors are likely\nto sell stolen information that can be used for identity theft or card fraud on specialist\ncriminal marketplaces; and\nAttackers do not always succeed in exfiltrating data from their victims but have still\nencrypted their victim’s files.\n\nNevertheless, the quantity and rate at which data is posted to leak sites may provide some\ninsight into the scale and tempo of different ransomware operations. It is notable that Maze\naccounts for almost 40% of all data leaks and that they have posted data continuously since\nFebruary this year. The actors in control of Conti began leaking data no earlier than the end\nof July, but in a little over six weeks have accounted for 13% of all leaks by ransomware\nactors.\n\nRunning total of data leaks since November 2019\n\nData leaks by ransomware operation\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRansomware attacks affect practically every business sector and are growing in intensity.\nThis is fuelled by an influx of new ransomware actors, the expansion of existing affiliate\nschemes and the pursuit of improved revenues by established cyber crime actors. The\nbarriers to entry into ransomware operations have been lowered by RaaS schemes which\nmeans that SMEs are as much at risk from a ransomware attack as large organisations,\ndespite high profile incidents by “big game hunters” such as WasteLocker and\nDoppelPaymer grabbing the headlines.\n\n## Contact us\n\n Contact us\n\n[Form](https://cloud.uk.info.pwc.com/cyber-security-sign-up-to-updates)\n\nHide\n\n\n-----",
