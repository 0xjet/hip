Furthermore, the\nemail itself looks benign, simple and straight to the point, informing the recipient that the\nrequired information is behind an external service due to an issue with storage size or\nformatting (Figure 1). This is a common tactic that allows malicious actors to circumvent mail\nfilters such as Mimecast, Microsoft EOP and Microsoft ATP.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2_\n\nUpon inspection of the “Download Files” button we can see that the service being used to\ndeliver this phish is in fact Mimecast, itself a legitimate service. Combining this with the\npreviously noted circumvention method makes standard detection almost impossible.\n\n_Figure 3_\n\nAs seen in Figure 3, the page presented to the user is a legitimate Mimecast service being\nused to host the malicious file. This is compounded by the use of a key to gain access to the\nfile by clicking the access-key button or entering a previously provided key (see Figure 3).\nHowever both methods will direct the user to the next stage\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce access has been gained to the first landing page, there will be an option to download\nthe malicious file at the side of the page. To add authenticity, the credentials of the original\nsender have been replicated, as shown below in Figure 4.\n\n_Figure 4_\n\n_Figure 5_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6_\n\nEmail Header analysis: Taking a look at the headers on Figure 6, it is a different\nstory altogether. IP addresses such as [10.x.x.182 and 10.x.x.36] are used by independent\noperating networks. These may be as small as a single computer connected to a\nhome gateway, and are installed in hundreds of millions of devices automatically.\n\nHowever, IP 41.x.x.131 belongs to MimecastSA (according to VirusTotal and Whois), and\ncould be the reason it escaped SEG detection.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7_\n\nHaving accessed the malicious link, the user will see the above page\ndisplayed (Figure 7) with a request for the user’s Microsoft email address and password.\nUnlike other credential phishing pages, the Microsoft background and logo aren’t displayed.\nThe simplicity of the page, combined with a URL lacking indicators of Microsoft or associated\ndomains, is suspect. The third field is the most obvious red flag (Figure 7): A recovery option\nis made available even though an incorrect password hasn’t been entered. This is\ndone to prompt the victim into providing a phone number.\n\n_Figure 8_\n\n\n-----\n\nHaving inserted test credentials, the information is exported to the phishing campaign\nURL address. This site is hosted by hxxps://www.docdroid[.]net/OwKxXnZ/purchase-order00177389-pdf. Entering information will continually refresh the page regardless of credentials\nsupplied.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\nNetwork IOC IP\n\n\nhXXp://biz267.inmotionhosting[.]com/~craneo5/pow/po[.]php\n\nhXXps://www.docdroid[.]net/OwKxXnZ/purchase-order-00177389pdf\n\n\n23[.]235[.]212[.]50\n\n54[.]37[.]79[.]95\n\n\n**_All third-party trademarks referenced by Cofense whether in logo form, name form or product_**\n**_form, or otherwise, remain the property of their respective holders, and use of these trademarks in_**\n**_no way indicates any relationship between Cofense and the holders of the trademarks.
