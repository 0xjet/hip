Information Stealing - Exfiltrating cookie session data, clipboard strings, and attempts to\nsteal user credentials.\n\n2. Self Propagation - Copies itself throughout the operating system and in the startup folder\nand can spread via removable drive.\n\n3. Denial of service (DOS) - Domain Name Service (DNS) request manipulation, and the\nability to send and receive spam email including advertisement flooding.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis time around we re seeing this malware group using RAR (compressed files created by\nthe WinRAR archiver) files with malicious JS (text file containing javascript code) files\nembedded. In this campaign the bad actors are spoofing Maersk Shipping Line - A Danish\ninternational container shipping company and the largest operating subsidiary of the Maersk\nGroup. Maersk is commonly spoofed because of its wide reach of customers and\nprevalence in the shipping industry. The lure being used in today's is a shipment bill of\nlading\n\n_Vjw0rm Sample_\n\n**Mitigation Tactics**\n\n1. If your organization doesn't regularly receive legitimate RAR files then we suggest\nbanning that file extension globally.\n\n2. User education has never been more important, malicious actors are constantly\ninnovating and pivoting, users need to be on their game and know what to look for and what\nnot to click on. Establish an easy process in your company where users can submit\nanything suspicious to your IT/Helpdesk team for review.\n\n3. Defense in depth is something that your company should constantly strive for.
