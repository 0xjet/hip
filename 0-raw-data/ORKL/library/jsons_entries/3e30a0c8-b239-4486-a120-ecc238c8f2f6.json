The\nspammers behind this scheme claimed they’d hacked your computer and recorded videos of\nyou watching porn, and promised to release the embarrassing footage to all your contacts\nunless a bitcoin demand was paid. Now, French authorities say they’ve charged two men\nthey believe are responsible for masterminding this scam. One of them is a 21-year-old\nhacker interviewed by KrebsOnSecurity in 2017 who openly admitted to authoring a banking\ntrojan called “Nuclear Bot.”\n\nThe author of a banking Trojan called Nuclear Bot — a teenager living in France — recently\nreleased the source code for his creation just months after the malware began showing up\nfor sale in cybercrime forums. Now the young man’s father is trying to convince him not to act\non a job offer in the United States, fearing it may be a trap set by law enforcement agents.\n\nMailing List\n\n[Subscribe here](https://krebsonsecurity.com/subscribe/)\nSearch KrebsOnSecurity\n\nRecent Posts\n\nSpam Nation\n\n\n-----\n\nA New York Times Bestseller!\n\nThinking of a Cybersecurity Career?\n\nRead this\n\n\n-----\n\nAll About Skimmers\n\nClick image for my skimmer series.\n\nStory Categories\n\n[A Little Sunshine](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/sunshine/)\n[All About Skimmers](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/all-about-skimmers/)\n[Ashley Madison breach](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/ashley-madison-breach/)\n[Breadcrumbs](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/breadcrumbs/)\n[Data Breaches](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/data-breaches/)\n[DDoS-for-Hire](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/ddos-for-hire/)\n[Employment Fraud](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/employment-fraud/)\n[How to Break Into Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/how-to-break-into-security/)\n[Latest Warnings](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/latest-warnings/)\n[Ne'er-Do-Well News](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/neer-do-well-news/)\n[Other](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/other/)\n[Pharma Wars](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/pharma-wars/)\n[Ransomware](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/ransomware/)\n[Russia's War on Ukraine](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/russias-war-on-ukraine/)\n[Security Tools](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/security-tools/)\n[SIM Swapping](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/sim-swapping/)\n[Spam Nation](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/spam-nation/)\n[Target: Small Businesses](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/smallbizvictims/)\n[Tax Refund Fraud](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/tax-refund-fraud/)\n[The Coming Storm](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/comingstorm/)\n[Time to Patch](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/patches/)\n[Web Fraud 2.0](https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/web-fraud-2-0/)\n\nThe Value of a Hacked PC\n\n\n-----\n\nBadguy uses for your PC\n\nBadguy Uses for Your Email\n\nYour email account may be worth far more than you imagine.\n\nWhy So Many Top Hackers Hail from Russia\n\n\n-----\n\nCategory: Web Fraud 2.0\n\nInnovations from the Underground\n\n\n-----\n\nID Protection Services Examined\n\nIs Antivirus Dead?\n\nThe reasons for its decline\n\nThe Growing Tax Fraud Menace\n\nFile 'em Before the Bad Guys Can\n\nInside a Carding Shop\n\n\n-----\n\nA crash course in carding.\n\nBeware Social Security Fraud\n\nSign up, or Be Signed Up!\n\nHow Was Your Card Stolen?\n\n\n-----\n\nFinding out is not so easy.\n\nKrebs’s 3 Rules…\n\n...For Online Safety.\n\n\n-----",
