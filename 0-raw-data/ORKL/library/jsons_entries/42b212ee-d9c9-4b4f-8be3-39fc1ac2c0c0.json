Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS and FBI identified Trojan malware variants used by the North\nKorean government. This malware variant is known as SHARPKNOT. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North\nKorean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.\n\nDHS and FBI are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean\ngovernment.\n\nThis MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques.\nUsers or administrators should flag activity associated with the malware, report the activity to the DHS National Cybersecurity and\nCommunications Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced\nmitigation.\n\nThis malware report contains analysis of a malicious 32-bit Windows executable file. When executed from the command line, the malware\noverwrites the Master Boot Record (MBR) and deletes files on the local system, any mapped network shares, and physically connected\nstorage devices.\n\nThe following Yara rule can be used to detect this malware:\n\n--- BEGIN YARA RULE --\nrule r4_wiper_1\n{\nmeta:\nsource = \"NCCIC Partner\"\ndate = \"2017-12-12\"\nstrings:\n$mbr_code = { 33 C0 8E D0 BC 00 7C FB 50 07 50 1F FC BE 5D 7C 33 C9 41 81 F9 00 ?? 74 24 B4 43 B0 00 CD 13 FE C2 80 FA 84\n7C F3 B2 80 BF 65 7C 81 05 00 04 83 55 02 00 83 55 04 00 83 55 06 00 EB D5 BE 4D 7C B4 43 B0 00 CD 13 33 C9 BE 5D 7C EB C5 }\n$controlServiceFoundlnBoth = { 83 EC 1C 57 68 3F 00 0F 00 6A 00 6A 00 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B F8 85 FF 74 44 8B 44 24 24 53 56 6A\n24 50 57 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 1D ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B F0 85 F6 74 1C 8D 4C 24 0C 51 6A 01 56 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? 68 E8 03 00 00 FF 15 ??\n?? ?? ?? 56 FF D3 57 FF D3 5E 5B 33 C0 5F 83 C4 1C C3 33 C0 5F 83 C4 1C C3 }\ncondition:\nuint16(0) == 0x5a4d and uint16(uint32(0x3c)) == 0x4550 and any of them\n}\n\nrule r4_wiper_2\n{\nmeta:\nsource = \"NCCIC Partner\"\ndate = \"2017-12-12\"\nstrings:\n// BIOS Extended Write\n$PhysicalDriveSTR = \"\\\\\\\\.\\\\PhysicalDrive\" wide\n$ExtendedWrite = { B4 43 B0 00 CD 13 }\ncondition:\nuint16(0) == 0x5a4d and uint16(uint32(0x3c)) == 0x4550 and all of them\n}\n\n--- END YARA RULE --\n\n**Files (1)**\n\n\nca057fd197fc99cfb60b7379cb64475e6bd206fdd4b019f1f70c2214115f3b83 (350CBA65E28C723CBF0724C19BD7EE...)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Findings\n\n### ca057fd197fc99cfb60b7379cb64475e6bd206fdd4b019f1f70c2214115f3b83\n\n\n**Details**\n\n\n**Name** 350CBA65E28C723CBF0724C19BD7EE69\n\n**Size** 20480 bytes\n\n**Type** PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n**MD5** 350cba65e28c723cbf0724c19bd7ee69\n\n**SHA1** c8cb01bc1f62c6d6b95caa7bf2cae167d5736ffa\n\n**SHA256** ca057fd197fc99cfb60b7379cb64475e6bd206fdd4b019f1f70c2214115f3b83\n\n**ssdeep** 192:s/7pzppvWcUcHfHxSnx5LqSe/7m8EI2K3A+Y6Geny6VuwjZhfJP4oynQ6f:K7pvWc/HfHsFGqrI2K3AZwuwzV4+6f\n\n**Entropy** 2.914359\n\n\n**Antivirus**\n\n\n**ClamAV** Win.Trojan.Agent-1388723\n\n\n**Yara Rules**\n\n\nNo matches found.\n\n**ssdeep Matches**\n\nNo matches found.\n\n\n**Packers/Compilers/Cryptors**\n\n\nMicrosoft Visual C++ 5.0\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\nThis file is a malicious 32-bit Windows executable. Analysis indicates the primary purpose of this application is to destroy a compromised\nWindows system by overwriting and deleting the Master Boot Record (MBR) on the victim's system and deleting files on network mapped\nshares as well as physically attached storage devices.\n\nThe malware must be executed from a command line using any alphanumeric character or string as an argument. Once executed, the\nmalware first attempts to disable the \"System Event Notification\" and \"Alerter\" services (Figure 1).\n\nNote: The Alerter service is present in Windows XP and Windows 2003, which are no longer supported by Microsoft. Current operating\nsystems supported by Microsoft do not run the Alerter service.\n\nNext, the malware overwrites the MBR, displaying a status in the command (CMD) window. If the malware is able to overwrite the MBR, an\n\"OK\" status is displayed in the CMD window. If the malware is unable to overwrite the MBR, a \"Fail\" status is displayed.\n\nAfter the MBR is overwritten, the malware attempts to gain access to physical and network drives attached to the victim's system and\nrecursively enumerate through the drive’s contents. When the malware identifies a file, it overwrites the file's contents with NULL bytes,\nrenames the file with a randomly generated file name (Figure 2), then deletes the file, making forensic recovery impossible.\n\nIf the malware is able to overwrite, rename and delete the file, the CMD window will display a “Break>\" status. If the malware is only able to\ndelete the file, the CMD window will display a “Del>\" status (Figure 3).\n\nOnce the malware has completed deleting files, the system is rebooted. If the malware has executed successfully, the system is rendered\ninoperative.\n\n\n-----\n\n**ScreenshotsFigure 1.

A Malware Analysis Report (MAR) includes results from both automated analysis and manual reverse engineering. In most**\ninstances this report will provide indicators for computer and network defense. To request additional analysis, please contact US-CERT and\nprovide information regarding the level of desired analysis.\n\n**Can I edit this document? This document is not to be edited in any way by recipients. All comments or questions related to this document**\nshould be directed to the US-CERT Security Operations Center at 1-888-282-0870 or soc@us-cert.gov.\n\n**Can I submit malware to NCCIC? Malware samples can be submitted via three methods:**\nWeb: https://malware.us-cert.gov\nE-Mail: submit@malware.us-cert.gov\nFTP: ftp.malware.us-cert.gov (anonymous)\n\nNCCIC encourages you to report any suspicious activity, including cybersecurity incidents, possible malicious code, software vulnerabilities,\nand phishing-related scams.
