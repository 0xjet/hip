These victims\nare from all over the world, and the submitted ransom notes all contained the email address\nof the threat actor.\n\n**A sharp spike in Babuk Ransomware submissions to ID Ransomware**\nLike the original operation, this ransomware attack adds the .babyk extension to encrypted\nfile names and drops a ransom note named How To Restore Your Files.txt.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Files encrypted by Babuk Locker**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nCompared to the original Babuk Ransomware operation that demanded hundreds of\nthousands, if not millions, of dollars to recover their files, this new threat actor is only asking\nfor .006 bitcoins or approximately $210 from their victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ransom note from new Babuk ransomware attack**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nThe new threat actors also misspelled Babuk by adding a 'C' to 'Babuck Locker' in the\nransom note.\n\nAnother noticeable change is that the original Babuk Locker operation utilized a dedicated\nTor payment site used to negotiate with victims. However, the new attacks are using email\nto communicate with victims through a babukransom@tutanota.com email address.\n\nIt is unclear how the ransomware is being distributed, but we have created a\n[dedicated Babuck Locker support topic that victims can use to share more information](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/754087/babuck-locker-help-and-support-topic-babyk-how-to-restore-your-filestxt/)\nabout the attack.\n\nIf anyone pays the ransom demand for this new ransomware campaign, please let us know\nas we would like to ask you some private questions.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Wind turbine firm Nordex hit by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wind-turbine-firm-nordex-hit-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Hackers use Conti's leaked ransomware to attack Russian companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-contis-leaked-ransomware-to-attack-russian-companies/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Babuk Locker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/babuk-locker/)\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Ransomware Builder](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware-builder/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
