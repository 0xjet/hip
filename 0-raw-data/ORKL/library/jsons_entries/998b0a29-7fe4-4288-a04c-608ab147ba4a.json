Once considered\nthe world’s largest malware botnet more than one year ago, Emotet was composed of\nhundreds of command and control servers and almost two million victims. Emotet was so\nlarge that it took a [joint effort between law enforcement agencies and authorities from](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action)\nNetherlands, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Lithuania, Canada,\nand Ukraine to allow investigators to take control of the botnet's servers, disrupt the\nmalware's operation, and arrest two operators.\n\nUnfortunately, law enforcement was not able to deliver a fatal blow to Emotet. In November\n2021, a new version of Emotet emerged. How did this happen? What is the botnet doing\ntoday? And how can organizations avoid becoming victims?\n\n## Emotet - Hard to Kill\n\nFirst discovered as a banking trojan in 2014, Emotet malware evolved into the go-to solution\nfor cybercriminals over the years. One of the main reasons for Emotet’s popularity is its\nfunctionality. Emotet is a self-propagating and “modular loader” malware, which means that\nwhile it is running on an infected system, botnet operators can send different modules that\nare capable of executing different jobs\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Emotet infrastructure essentially acted as a primary door opener for computer systems\non a global scale. It was then rented by cyber criminals to install their own malware: info\nstealers, ransomware, banking trojans, and other types of malware. In many respects,\nEmotet worked like a SaaS solution, only in this case, it was MaaS (malware-as-a-service).\n\nObserving millions of infected machines, law enforcement tried to move against Emotet. In\nJanuary 2021, law enforcement shut down Emotet and seized the infrastructure behind it.\nAfter gaining control of the infrastructure, on April 25, 2021, law enforcement effectively killed\nthe botnets by issuing a final update to remove the remaining infections. But before the\n[takedown, a partnership between Emotet operators and the Trickbot group allowed Trickbot](https://intel471.com/blog/understanding-the-relationship-between-emotet-ryuk-and-trickbot)\noperators to leverage the Emotet infrastructure to distribute Trickbot, a banking trojan. On\nNovember 14, 2021, Trickbot command and control servers began issuing tasks to their\ninfected machines, instructing them to download a new Emotet version.\n\nEmotet began spreading rapidly once again. The malware that law enforcement hoped to kill\nwas back in business.\n\n## BitSight Exclusive: Ransomware for Dummies\n\n### Bring your strategic defense to the next level\n\n## BitSight Exclusive: Ransomware for Dummies\n\n\n-----\n\n### Bring your strategic defense to the next level\n\nRansomware attacks globally nearly doubled in 2021. BitSight’s Ransomware for Dummies\nbook reveals indicators of potential attacks, and how to minimize costly damage when\nsuccessful ransomware targets you.\n\nDownload eBook\nButton Arrow\n\n## Emotet Infection Chain\n\nEmotet spreads itself via email phishing campaigns, using the infected computers to send\nthe malicious emails. The emails can have multiple formats, such as simple emails without\nany context or replies to stolen email threads. Typically, the emails can carry either an\nattached Excel/Word document, a password-protected zip file, or a link to download the\ndocument. More recently, on April 22, our team spotted Emotet using LNK files instead of the\nusual Excel files, showing that the threat actors are trying to improve their tactics to increase\ntheir infection success rate.\n\nBelow is an example of a hijacked email thread with an attached Excel XLS file:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Hijacked email thread (observed by BitSight)_\n\nWhen opened, the attached Excel file asks the user to enable the macros:\n\n_Figure 2. Emotet XLS file (observed by BitSight)_\n\nOnce the user clicks “Enable Content,” Excel runs a macro that will try to download and\nexecute the Emotet payload. Below, we can see what a complete process tree looks like\nwhen the macros are enabled:\n\n_[Figure 3. Emotet infection process tree (https://tria.ge/220517-g92l5sgac3/)](https://tria.ge/220517-g92l5sgac3/)_\n\nAs seen above, the process tree ends with Emotet being launched via regsvr32.exe.\n\nIf the compromised user has administrator privileges, Emotet sets up persistence by creating\na Windows service that will run automatically. If the user has regular permissions, a new key\ngets added under the Windows registry key\n\"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\".\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce installed, Emotet starts polling tasks from the command and control servers. These\ntasks can instruct the bot to either execute an Emotet module or a third-party malware.\n\nTypically, we see Emotet trying to steal information (email client passwords, email contacts,\nemail threads, and saved browser credentials) and turn the victim's computer into a spam bot\ncapable of sending emails using the stolen credentials.\n\nIn some cases, we see Emotet trying to install third-party malware, which means that the\nbotnet operators will provide access to other threat actors that operate a different type of\nmalware. Since the re-emergence of Emotet, we have seen Emotet delivering malware such\nas CobaltStrike, Qbot, and SystemBC.\n\n## Emotet Infections on the Rise\n\nSince March 2022, BitSight has observed Emotet targeting more than 3 million unique email\naddresses with spam.\n\n_Figure 4. Total targets (observed by BitSight)_\n\nOne thing that is interesting to note about Emotet is that there are occasionally time periods\nwhere no emails are sent at all. This is typical of Emotet’s behavior, and usually comes when\nthe operators are working on an update to the malware. Time periods of no activity are\n\n\n-----\n\ntypically followed by periods of heightened activity when a new wave of spam emails is being\nsent.\n\n## Effectiveness of Emotet in Collecting Credentials\n\nSince March 2022, BitSight has observed more than 300,000 unique stolen email\ncredentials, suggesting that Emotet is again becoming a significant malware threat.\n\n_Figure 5. Total stolen credentials (observed by BitSight)_\n\n## Japan and Italy in the Crosshairs\n\nWhile BitSight observes a significant number of top-level domains being targeted, Japan\nstands out as one of the most targeted top-level domains. Our observations are consistent\nwith [previous reports from Japan’ s CERT, JPCC, describing the rise in Emotet infections](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/at/2022/at220006.html)\naffecting Japanese email addresses. Besides the interest in Japan, Emotet regularly targets\nItaly with malicious email campaigns.\n\nSince the beginning of March, we have seen .COM, .IT (Italy), and .JP (Japan) as the three\nmost targeted top-level domains within the spam targets. The remaining top-level domains\nthat complete the top 10 list of most targeted TLDs are: .BR, .MX, .NET, .CA, .FR, .ID, and\n.DE.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Spam targets top 10 TLD (observed by BitSight)_\n\nDuring the same period, we have observed that .COM, .JP, and .MX (Mexico) are the toplevel domains that are observed to have the highest number of stolen email credentials. The\nremaining top-level domains that complete the top 10 list of TLDs within the stolen\ncredentials are: .IT, .BR, .NET, .ZA, .IN, .ID, and .AR.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7.

These servers are reverse\nproxies that forward bot requests to upstream servers (Tier-2 C2), which in turn forward\nrequests to another tier of upstream servers (Tier-3 C2), and so on.\n\n\n-----\n\nBitSight has identified a total of 339 Tier-1 C2s. These servers were most prevalent in the\nUS, Germany, and France. Other countries observed hosting a high number of Tier-1 C2s\ninclude: Singapore, Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea, Canada, and the UK. These 10\ncountries hosted roughly 70% of the identified Tier-1 C2s.\n\nIn all, BitSight observed a total of 47 countries hosting Tier-1 C2s. The map below highlights\nthe distribution of these servers by country (red indicates the highest number of servers).\n\n## Global Distribution of Emotet Infected Systems\n\nNetwork telemetry of the communications with the Tier-1 C2s since the beginning of March\nallowed us to estimate the distribution of Emotet infected systems around this time. We can\neasily see that, by now, there are infected systems, or bots, all over the world. Based on that\ntelemetry, the most affected countries are: Brazil, Thailand, and Indonesia. These three\ncountries amount to roughly 33% of all infected systems. The remaining countries in the top\n10 of countries with most infections are: India, Italy, Mexico, United States, Saudi Arabia,\nPhilippines, and Vietnam. The top 10 amount to 69% of all infected systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Responding to Emotet: Best Practices and IOCs\n\nEmotet is a notorious malware family that has resurfaced after suffering a takedown.\nOrganizations should treat it as a significant adversary to their infrastructures since it can\ncause lots of damage to them and enable access to other criminals, such as ransomware\noperators. Emotet is most likely still in a growing/testing phase and recovering from the\neffects of a takedown. Nevertheless, organizations should know that this threat is back and,\nonce again, targeting companies worldwide.\n\nThe main spread method for Emotet is via email malicious files or links, so following cyber\nrisk best practices and preventing the opening of suspicious emails is the best preemptive\nmeasure to avoid getting infected. BitSight has published a short list of cyber risk best\npractices.\n\nFor network administrators, please consider adding BitSight’s IOCs IP list to traffic filtering\nsolutions to successfully prevent compromised systems communicating effectively with their\nC2 servers, downloading and installing further malware.
