In January, Synoptek, a California-based IT service provider\n[decided to pay the ransom to decrypt its files after being infected with the Sodinokibi](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/96017/malware/sodinokibi-ransomware-attack.html)\nransomware.\n\nKenneth Cole Productions, Inc. is an American fashion house founded in 1982 by Kenneth\nCole.\n\nThe Sodinokibi ransomware operators claim to have stolen over 70,000 documents with\nfinancial and work data, and more than 60,000 records of company customers.\n\nThe Sodinokibi gang requested the payment of a ransom and threatens to leak online the full\ndump containing stolen data in case the company will decide to not meet the request.\n\n“Kenneth Cole Productions, you have to hurry,” the ransomware operators said. “When time\n_is up and there is no feedback from you, the entire cloud data will be published, including_\n_your customers’ personal data.”_\n\n\n-----\n\n[In December, for the first time, the crime gang behind the Maze ransomware, decided to](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/95356/malware/maze-ransomware-data-leak.html)\nblackmail the victims and force them to pay the ransom.\n\nThis move is shocking and brings the ransomware attack to a higher level of threat, we can\nexpect that other cybercrime gangs will adopt a similar strategy to blackmail the victims and\nforce them to pay the ransom.\n\n[Other groups, such as the Nemty Ransomware and BitPyLock gangs adopted the same](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/90396/malware/nemty-ransomware.html)\ntechnique in January 2020.\n\n**[Pierluigi Paganini](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559)**\n\n**[(SecurityAffairs –](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)** **hacking, Kenneth Cole)**\n\nCopyright 2021 Security Affairs by Pierluigi Paganini All Right Reserved.\nBack to top\n\n[Home](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)\n[Cyber Crime](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-crime)\n[Cyber warfare](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-warfare-2)\n[APT](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/apt)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Data Breach](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/data-breach)\n[Deep Web](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/deep-web)\n[Digital ID](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/digital-id)\n[Hacking](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacking)\n[Hacktivism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacktivism)\n[Intelligence](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/intelligence)\n[Internet of Things](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/iot)\n[Laws and regulations](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/laws-and-regulations)\n[Malware](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/malware)\n[Mobile](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/mobile-2)\n[Reports](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/reports)\n[Security](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/security)\n[Social Networks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/social-networks)\n[Terrorism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/terrorism)\n[ICS-SCADA](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/ics-scada)\n[EXTENDED COOKIE POLICY](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/extended-cookie-policy)\n[Contact me](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/contact)\n\n\n-----",
