    "plain_text": "# Strategic Analysis: Agent Tesla Expands Targeting and Networking Capabilities\n\n**[cofense.com/strategic-analysis-agent-tesla-expands-targeting-and-networking-capabilities/](https://cofense.com/strategic-analysis-agent-tesla-expands-targeting-and-networking-capabilities/)**\n\nCofense December 15, 2020\n\nA new iteration of the Agent Tesla keylogger has expanded on its data harvesting capabilities\nand exfiltration efforts in phishing campaigns primarily targeting India and ISPs. Cofense\nIntelligence recently alerted customers to Agent Tesla’s high volume compared to other\nkeylogger families from January to August this year. The newest iteration of the keylogger\nadded to that volume, likely as threat actors moved to adopt the updated version.\n\nThreat actors who transition to this version of Agent Tesla gain the capability to target a wider\nrange of stored credentials, including those for web browser, email, VPN and other services.\nThis may indicate an increased interest in stolen credentials for a more specialized segment\nof the market or a particular kind of product or service. The update also includes networking\ncapabilities that create a more robust set of exfiltration methods, including the use of the\nTelegram messaging service—adding to an overall trend of abusing trusted platforms to\nevade network-based detection. For Cofense Intelligence customers, technical details of\nthese and other updates are available in the full report in ThreatHQ.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Top regions targeted by the different versions of Agent Tesla._\n\n_Figure 2: Top industries targeted by the different versions of Agent Tesla._\n\nFrom August to December of this year, the newest iteration of Agent Tesla largely followed\nthe same pattern as the older version in terms of targeted industries and regions. Figure 1\nshows that both versions preferred to target email accounts in India more than any other\nregion. The United States and Brazil were also among the top three most targeted regions.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 shows that Agent Tesla overwhelmingly targeted internet service providers (ISPs)\nover other industries. Utilities and financial services rounded out the top three targeted\nindustries.\n\nISPs could be considered a major target for threat actors because of the other industry\nverticals that rely on them for essential functions. A compromised ISP could give threat\nactors access to organizations that have integrations and downstream permissions with the\nISP. Subscribers would also be at risk, as ISPs often hold emails or other critical personal\ndata that could be used to gain access to other accounts and services. In at least one\n[incident, attackers reportedly targeted subscriber data of a compromised ISP in Austria.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-breached-a1-telekom-austrias-largest-isp/%23:~:text%3DA1%2520Telekom%252C%2520the%2520largest%2520internet,malware%2520infection%2520in%2520November%25202019.&sa=D&ust=1607978903702000&usg=AOvVaw1KZ1tU8XuqyyvdxnXh4DbZ)\n\nAgent Tesla has been a major force within the phishing-threat landscape for years and has\nsteadily evolved, likely in response to threat actors’ demands and improvements in network\ndefenses. The variety of infection chains that use this keylogger family as its final payload\nare too numerous to list, which shows the versatility of this particular family. The fact that\nolder versions of Agent Tesla keylogger are still successful today likely indicates that threat\nactors will be slow to adopt the newest version. However, once threat actors realize the\nbenefits gained from updating to the newest version, they may transition more quickly as the\nnew features might be necessary. Despite the dangerous capabilities of both versions of\nAgent Tesla, organizations can protect themselves by educating their employees and\nkeeping proper mitigations in place.\n\n**All third-party trademarks referenced by Cofense whether in logo form, name form or product**\n**form, or otherwise, remain the property of their respective holders, and use of these trademarks in**\n**no way indicates any relationship between Cofense and the holders of the trademarks.
