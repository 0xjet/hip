The\n[malware was named by Proofpoint Emerging Threats Labs, whose signatures recognize the](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/daily-ruleset-update-summary-20210924)\nmalware based on its command and control (C2) traffic. Since then, the malware has been\n[spotted in several campaigns, each showing similar infection chains. The following graphic](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse.php?search=tag%3Amirrorblast)\nshows the rough sequence of a MirrorBlast campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 – Infection chain of a MirrorBlast campaign seen in October 2021.\n\n## Is MirrorBlast a campaign from TA505?\n\n[After MirrorBlast’s emergence, some security researchers speculated that it could be linked](https://twitter.com/Cyjax_Ltd/status/1446060667455393795)\nto TA505. Comparing MirrorBlast activity to historical TA505 Get2/SDBBot campaigns\nrevealed numerous similarities in tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). We assess that\nthese similarities significantly strengthen the hypothesis that MirrorBlast and TA505 are\nlinked. In this article, we describe some of these similarities:\n\nSimilarities in modus operandi\nSimilar domain registration patterns\nCampaign cadence\nSimilar download websites and lure documents\nSimilar target selection mechanisms\nFollow-up malware\n\n\n-----\n\n**Similarities in Modus Operandi**\n\nThe Get2/SDBBot campaign TTPs were always similar, as if the group followed a strict\nplaybook: The domains were registered, the download website was set up, and before the\nmalware was distributed, the attackers uploaded a legitimate document to the download\nwebsite. This was probably for testing purposes. Sometimes it was an empty document or\none containing the characters “123”. But occasionally the attackers uploaded Excel\ndocuments containing several spreadsheets and legitimate content. For example, Figure 2\nshows the test document that was uploaded during the Get2/SDBBot campaign on 14\nSeptember 2020.\n\nLooking at the MirrorBlast campaigns, the threat actor behaved similarly. The campaign on\n14 October 2021 was notable. Like TA505, the attackers registered domains, published the\ndownload website, and uploaded a test document. Strikingly, this test document was the\nsame document as used by TA505 in a campaign in 2020, demonstrating an overlap in the\nattackers’ methods as well as the tools they use.\n\nFigure 2 – Legitimate Excel file uploaded to TA505 and MirrorBlast malware distribution\nwebsites.\n\n**Similar Domain Registration Patterns**\n\nIn Get2/SDBBot campaigns, TA505 registered new domains that had recognizable\ncharacteristics:\n\n\n-----\n\nMost domains impersonated well-known online services or used related keywords\nThe domains often contained one or more hyphen characters to separate words\nThe domains used the top-level domain .com\n\nHere are some examples of known TA505 domains:\n\n**Known TA505 Domains**\n\n_xbox-en-cnd[.]com_\n\n_one-drive-storage[.]com_\n\n_store-in-box[.]com_\n\n_microsoft-store-drm-server[.]com_\n\n_clouds-doanload-cnd[.]com_\n\n_microsoft-sback-server[.]com_\n\n_one-drive-ms[.]com_\n\n_owncloud-cdn[.]com_\n\n_cdn-onedrive-live[.]com_\n\n_office-en-service[.]com_\n\nAs you can see, the domains follow a consistent naming convention. Moreover, the\ncombination of certain domain registrars and DNS service providers is also a good indicator\nof new TA505 domains. Figure 3 shows the domain registrars used in the documented\nTA505 campaigns from September 2019 to December 2020. Most of the time, Eranet\nInternational Limited was used to register the new domains and only rarely were others used.\nBut in November and December 2020 this pattern changed when most domains were\nregistered through Cnobin Information Technology Limited. After that, no more TA505\nGet2/SDBBot campaigns ceased, resulting in no temporal overlap with MirrorBlast\ncampaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 – TA505 domain registrations by registrar, September 2019 to December 2020.\n\nAs of October 2021, there are only a few known MirrorBlast domains. However, even the\nlimited data suggest a consistent pattern in MirrorBlast domain registrations. As with TA505,\nthe attackers imitate a well-known online service and often delimit keywords in their domains\nwith hyphens. The threat actor behind the MirrorBlast campaigns used Cnobin Information\nTechnology Limited to register their domains. This domain registrar was used by TA505 at\nthe time of their last known activity in late 2020. There is no overlap in DNS service\nproviders, since TA505 only used DNSPod and Cloudflare.\n\nFigure 4 – MirrorBlast domain registrations.\n\n**Campaign Cadence**\n\nIn 2020, TA505 ran a new campaign almost every day during the week. For this purpose,\nnew domains were registered for Get2 and SDBBot distribution nearly every campaign. In\naddition, the spam waves of the campaigns were large. Comparing the cadence of\nMirrorBlast activity is difficult because of the limited data available at this point. However,\ncomparing MirrorBlast activity to date suggests that the campaigns became more frequent at\nthe end of September 2021 and currently match the cadence of TA505 campaigns. New\ndomains are registered almost daily, which are used to spread malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5 – Timeline showing MirrorBlast domain registrations from September to October\n2021.\n\n**Infrastructure Overlap**\n\nIn the [MirrorBlast campaign on 4 October 2021, an overlap with known TA505 infrastructure](https://app.any.run/tasks/2915d0ca-3608-4fb2-9207-7ee09b560a61/)\nwas detected. The IP address 169.239.128[.]11, which pointed to the domain\nfidufagios[.]com in the MirrorBlast campaign, was previously used in a TA505 campaign on 9\nOctober 2019. In the MirrorBlast campaign, the IP address was used for command and\ncontrol (C2). Meanwhile, in the TA505 campaign, the IP address pointed to the domain\nonedrive-sdn[.]com and was used to host a malicious Excel document.\n\n**Campaign** **Date** **Domain** **IP Address**\n\nMirrorBlast 4 October 2021 fidufagios[.]com **169.239.128[.]11**\n\nGet2/SDBBot (TA505) 9 October 2019 onedrive-sdn[.]com **169.239.128[.]11**\n\n**Similar Download Websites and Lure Documents**\n\nAnother similarity between the two campaigns is the design and use of websites to trick\nusers into downloading malicious Excel spreadsheets. Both campaigns lead users to a\ndownload website via a hyperlink or an HTML attachment, whose design varies from\ncampaign to campaign. Figure 6 shows the website of a Get2/SDBBot TA505 campaign from\n14 February 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6 – Website used in Get2/SDBBot campaign, February 2020.\n\nIn the MirrorBlast campaign on 7 October 2021 (Figure 7), the website’s design was almost\nidentical to the one used in campaigns attributed to TA505. The reuse of the websites\nsuggests that MirrorBlast and TA505 may be linked, or re-purposed by another threat actor\nwith access to the website source code.\n\nFigure 7 – Website used in MirrorBlast campaign, October 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nTA505 mostly used Excel documents to distribute Get2 and SDBBot. If you open the\ndocument, you will usually find an image designed to trick the user into activating Microsoft\nOffice’s macro functionality, which causes a malicious macro to run. These social\nengineering images varied in the Get2/SDBBot campaigns orchestrated by TA505.\n\nExamining the images used in MirrorBlast lure documents reveals that they are almost\nidentical to the TA505 documents (Figures 8 and 9).\n\nFigure 8 – Lure document in TA505 campaign, 19 August 2020.\n\nThe only major difference is that the MirrorBlast campaign targeted a German-speaking\nregion, so the threat actor translated the text into German. However, if you look at the text\nclosely, you will notice that the second to last sentence was not translated and is identical to\nthe TA505 campaign. Such images and designs can be copied by other threat actors and\nused for their own purposes. For this reason, this similarity only weakly supports the view\nthat MirrorBlast and TA505 are linked.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9 – Lure document in MirrorBlast campaign, 13 October 2021.\n\n**Similar Target Selection Mechanisms**\n\nThe download websites used to distribute Get2, a loader used by TA505, were selective\nabout which visitors to infect. Namely, they only offered the malicious Excel document to\nvisitors with a Windows User-Agent. If a user with a different User-Agent finds their way to\nthe website, they are [redirected to Apple’s iOS website.](https://urlscan.io/result/55c2ec69-d1ce-442b-94ab-d4d350b0a0a9/)\n\nFigure 10 – Website redirect used in a TA505 campaign.\n\nWe found similar target selection behavior when looking at the MirrorBlast download\nwebsites. If you visit the website with a non-Windows User-Agent, you are also redirected to\nthe Apple iOS website.\n\nFigure 11 – Website redirect used in a MirrorBlast campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis similar behavior is interesting, but also can be used to detect new TA505 and\n[MirrorBlast domains. For example, urlscan.io, an online URL scanning service, has a search](https://urlscan.io/)\nfeature that network defenders can use to find TA505 and MirrorBlast URLs submitted to the\nservice:\n\n_page.url:”*/ios/ios-13*”_\n_page.url:”*/ios/ios-15*”_\n\nIn the known Get2 campaigns of TA505, a short reconnaissance phase took place after the\ninitial infection. The computer name, username, Windows version, and a list of active\nprocesses were collected and sent to the C2 via an HTTP POST request. The C2 responded\nwith a cookie and URLs leading to the next malware stage depending on this information.\nThis mechanism gives TA505 the ability to select which infected systems to deliver the next\nmalware stage, thereby minimizing delivery to malware analysis systems and targets of little\nvalue.\n\nMirrorBlast performs similar checks. In the KiXtart phase, which occurs after the Excel macro\ncode executes, the malware sends various information about the client to a C2 server. This\nincludes the domain name, computer name and username.\n\nFigure 12 – System information sent to C2 in KiXtart phase.\n\nIf this information originates from a client of interest to the attacker, the next malware stage\nfollows. In the Rebol phase, information about the client is again collected. The computer\nname, username and system architecture are transmitted to a C2 via an HTTP GET request.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13 – Base64 encoded system information sent to C2 in Rebol phase, with a UUID\nreturned.\n\nIn response, the C2 server returns a UUID. This UUID is encoded in Base64 and used as an\nargument in subsequent HTTP GET requests. This way, the C2 operator can select which\nsystems they want to infect.\n\nFigure 14 – Base64 encoded system information sent to C2 in Rebol phase, with no UUID\nreturned.\n\n**Follow-up Malware**\n\nAnother similarity between TA505 and MirrorBlast is the malware that is eventually delivered\nto an infected system. According to [public reports, the follow-up malware of a MirrorBlast](https://twitter.com/ffforward/status/1446212189438754826)\ncampaign is FlawedGrace (GraceWire). FlawedGrace is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that\n\n\n-----\n\nwas often used by the TA505 group. A [report from ANSSI indicates the malware was used](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2020-CTI-009.pdf)\nexclusively by TA505 in mid-2020. Assuming that FlawedGrace is only available to TA505,\nthe appearance of FlawedGrace in MirrorBlast campaigns is strong evidence that MirrorBlast\nis closely linked to TA505. However, whether TA505’s exclusive control over FlawedGrace\nhas extended beyond mid-2020 is unclear.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis article compares the TTPs used in MirrorBlast and TA505’s Get2/SDBBot campaigns.\nWe focused on similar characteristics between the two. Whether TA505 is behind the\nMirrorBlast campaigns or another threat actor is responsible is not definitively clear based on\nthese similarities, so we leave this for the reader to decide. Regardless of who is behind\nMirrorBlast, the campaign uses novel techniques (i.e. the KiXtart and Rebol phases) and has\nramped up its activity in recent weeks. Therefore, we recommend organizations to implement\nprevention and detection measures to prevent infection with this malware. To accompany this\narticle, we have published indicators of compromise (IOCs) of known MirrorBlast campaigns\nin the Appendix.\n\n## IOCs\n\n**Observed MirrorBlast Campaigns:**\ncdn03664-dl-fileshare[.]com\nXLS: 2acdd04554feb1ef8b0307d5fb2c1bf7fd6a8e1157f9d3753119e64b30c16c30\nKiXtart payload download: 185.225.19[.]246\nMSI KiXtart: a403eae5b12b909f4075e855f58d1742308d5e0d3450e79b60162fa9fb7caad7\nKiXtart C2: 185.176.220[.]198\nRebol payload download: 5.188.108[.]40\nMSI Rebol: a69d27abd043cc676095f71300bf6b2368167536fcd4fe5342cf79a7e94fc2fe\nRebol C2: feristoaul[.]com\ndzikic-my-sharepoint[.]com\nXLS: 4648edc370e61a52c95d3f525391e0154406fd661d01d091f2d9dba9f8a485f2\nKiXtart payload download: 185.10.68[.]235\nMSI KiXtart: 2b108ec3e467ab6c3a9ad6a5545e8410e4185f8fee7a008d3d3a89a8caf86e75\nKiXtart C2: 185.202.93[.]201\nRebol payload download: 185.225.19[.]156\nMSI Robol: 0e6451e1f0eadb89390f4360e2a49a2ffb66e92e8b3ae75400095e75f4dd6abb\nRebol C2: fidufagios[.]com\ndzikics-my-sharepoint[.]com\nXLS: f4891094d6623dadbf84486b85a29b4bd0badf28ee100bc0e44c550715614e62\nKiXtart payload download: 185.10.68[.]235\nMSI KiXtart: ed7709cbbad9e164a45235be5270d6fb3492010ea945728a7d58f65f63434e58\nKiXtart C2: 185.183.96[.]147\nRebol payload download: 192.36.27[.]92\n\n\n-----\n\nMSI Robol: 0e6451e1f0eadb89390f4360e2a49a2ffb66e92e8b3ae75400095e75f4dd6abb\nRebol C2: fidufagios[.]com\ncdn-8846-sharepoint-office[.]com\nXLS: 28221d5ed7a6b37a4a0e5be77a9137378b1b6ca850c6327b77eae7a2b4437c96\nKiXtart payload download: 155.138.205[.]35\nKiXtart MSI: 83e4c90dc8bc1c53a4000bef83a355c4e36d2a1ba4a5d0982bc5b9b350278f1f\nKiXtart C2: 45.79.239[.]23\ncdnfilesdrop[.]com\ncdn0341.us-dropbox[.]com\ncdn9883.us-dropbox[.]com\nXLS: 67af798c2d8e2a5d19fb304d60aca9c40cc23ae40d350ddef0c9a8ac95e94555\nRebol payload download: hxxp://23.19.58[.]52\nRebol MSI: eceb164a69e8f79bb08099fcdf2b75071c527b0107daebc0e7a88e246b4c7f13\nRebol C2: feristoaul[.]com\n**Potential follow-up malware:**\nhxxp://141.164.41[.]231/host64_sh.bin\nhxxp://141.164.41[.]231/host32_pic.bin\nhxxp://5.149.255[.]14/host64_sh.bin\nhxxp://5.149.255[.]14/host32_pic.bin\nhxxp://89.44.197[.]46/host64_sh.bin\nhxxp://89.44.197[.]46/host32_pic.bin\nhxxp://193.42.36[.]110/host64_sh.bin\nhxxp://193.42.36[.]110/host32_pic.bin\nhost64_sh.bin: c1b4a0b9eadbf51e13343270b7ef85703b8a11ee736526f61193b821a72bef1f\nhost32_pic.bin:\naa42da6f08308796d2f1a61ea4aa79ac6054b2f57670e553d7fda481bd521737\nC2: cdn-wfs-nspod[.]com\nTags\n\n[mirrorblast](https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/blog/?post-tag=mirrorblast) [ta505](https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/blog/?post-tag=ta505)\n\n\n-----",
