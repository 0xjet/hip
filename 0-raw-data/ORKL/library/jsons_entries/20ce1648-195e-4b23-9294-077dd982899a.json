This technique,\nreferred to as RTF template injection, leverages the legitimate RTF template functionality. It\nsubverts the plain text document formatting properties of an RTF file and allows the retrieval of a\nURL resource instead of a file resource via an RTF’s template control word capability. This enables\na threat actor to replace a legitimate file destination with a URL from which a remote payload may\nbe retrieved.\n\nThe sample RTF template injection files analyzed for this publication currently have a lower\ndetection rate by public antivirus engines when compared to the well-known Office-based template\ninjection technique. Proofpoint has identified distinct phishing campaigns utilizing the technique\nwhich have been attributed to a diverse set of APT threat actors in the wild. While this technique\nappears to be making the rounds among APT actors in several nations, Proofpoint assesses with\nmoderate confidence, based on the recent rise in its usage and the triviality of its implementation,\nthat it could soon be adopted by cybercriminals as well.\n\n## RTF Template Injection \n\nRTF template injection is a simple technique in which an RTF file containing decoy content can be\naltered to allow for the retrieval of content hosted at an external URL upon opening an RTF file. By\naltering an RTF file’s document formatting properties, specifically the document formatting control\nword for “\\*\\template” structure, actors can weaponize an RTF file to retrieve remote content by\nspecifying a URL resource instead of an accessible file resource destination. RTF files include their\ndocument formatting properties as plaintext strings within the bytes of the file. This allows the\nproperty control word syntax to be referenced even in the absence of a word processor application,\nproviding formatting stability for the filetype across numerous platforms. However, RTF files based\non the malleability of these plaintext strings within the bytes of a file are often subverted for\nmalicious file delivery purposes in the context of a phishing campaign. While historically the use of\n[embedded malicious RTF objects has been well documented as a method for delivering malware](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/malware)\nfiles using RTFs, this new technique is more simplistic and, in some ways, a more effective method\nfor remote payload delivery than previously documented techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. RTF Document Formatting Properties Rich Text Format (RTF)_ _[Version 1.5 Specification.](http://www.biblioscape.com/rtf15_spec.htm)_\n\nAs documented in the RTF file Version 1.5 specifications (Figure 1), RTF files include a\n“\\*\\template” control word, where the value “*\\” designates that the following value is a destination,\nand “template” designates the specific control word function. This control word value is intended to\nbe the destination of a legitimate template file which is retrieved and loaded upon the opening of\nthe initial RTF, changing the visual appearance of the file. However, it is trivial to alter the bytes of\nan existing RTF file to insert a template control word destination including a URL resource. This\nallows the RTF file to retrieve a URL resource as a destination rather than a file like the RTF\nstructure intends. This method is viable in both .rtf and .doc.rtf files, allowing for the successful\nretrieval of remote payloads hosted at an external URL.\n\n## RTF Template Injection in Microsoft Word\n\nIn the case of .doc.rtf files the extension specifies that the RTF file will be opened utilizing Microsoft\nWord. As a result, when an RTF Remote Template Injection file is opened using Microsoft Word,\nthe application will retrieve the resource from the specified URL before proceeding to display the\nlure content of the file. This technique is successful despite the inserted URL not being a valid\ndocument template file. This process is demonstrated in Figures 2 and 3 below in which an RTF\nfile has been weaponized by researchers to retrieve the documentation page for RTF version 1.5\nfrom a URL at the time the file is opened. The technique is also valid in the .rtf file extension\nformat, however a message is displayed when opened in Word which indicates that the content of\nthe specified URL is being downloaded and in some instances an error message is displayed in\nwhich the application specifies that an invalid document template was utilized prior to then\ndisplaying the lure content within the file.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Sample RTF template injection File Downloading Remote Resource._\n\n_Figure 3. Sample RTF template injection File Displayed Lure._\n\n## Weaponization\n\n\n-----\n\nThe weaponization of an RTF file can be achieved by creating or altering an existing RTF file’s\ndocument property bytes using a hex editor. This technique does not require the use of a word\nprocessor application for the injection of the RTF remote template URL into the file. The example in\nFigure 4 demonstrates the insertion of a template control word into an existing RTF file, specifically\nwithin a preexisting enclosing group for a font family control word. Note that the template control\nword value is not contained in an independent set of braces, which results in an invalid RTF file\nformat error. Instead, it is appended at the beginning of an existing enclosing group for a font family\ncontrol word allowing for a valid RTF file structure. This is not the only control word group of an\nRTF file that will successfully incorporate a template control word as part of an existing enclosing\ngroup. RTF files allow for the parsing of destination control words in a number of enclosing groups\nthroughout the file structure. The below file excerpt has been included for demonstrative\npurposes.\n\n_Figure 4. Sample RTF template injection Template Control Word._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe success of this technique was tested in a limited capacity by researchers at Proofpoint and is\nlikely more malleable than what has been demonstrated in this publication. The malleability of this\nmethod paired with an RTF file’s capability to render encoding for Unicode characters further\nincreases the viability of this technique. By including the template control word within various\nenclosing groups of a file and utilizing Unicode rendering to obfuscate the included URLs, this\ntechnique may prove to be an in the wild alternative to Office based Template Injection.\n\n## A Timeline of APT Actors Adopting RTF Template Injection\n\nProofpoint has observed an increasing adoption of RTF template injection from February through\nApril of 2021 by APT threat actors. While the technique appears to pre-date this adoption with\n[researchers mentioning the technique as early as January 2021, two distinct APT groups believed](https://fareedfauzi.github.io/posts/Maldoc-Cheatsheet/)\nto be associated with the state interests of India and China adopted RTF template injection during\nthis time. Signs of weaponization including the registration of delivery infrastructure were observed\nbeginning on March 15, 2021 and April 8, 2021, respectively, with multiple distinct campaigns\nfollowing throughout the months of April and May.\n\nTemplate injection RTF files attributable to the APT group DoNot Team, that has [historically been](https://www.first.org/resources/papers/tallinn2019/Linking_South_Asian_cyber_espionnage_groups-to-publish.pdf)\nsuspected of being aligned with Indian-state interests, were identified through July 8, 2021. RTF\nfiles likely attributable to a Chinese-related APT actor were identified as recently as September 29,\n2021, targeting entities with ties to Malaysian deep water energy exploration. Following this initial\nadoption period, the APT actor Gamaredon, which has been linked to the Russian Federal Security\nService (FSB), was later observed utilizing RTF template injection files in campaigns that\nleveraged Ukrainian governmental file lures on October 5, 2021.\n\n_Figure 5. Timeline of RTF template injection Adoption by APT Actors._\n\n## Analyzing DoNot Team RTF Template Injection \n\n\n-----\n\nThe earliest observed public instance of the APT actor DoNot Team utilizing RTF template injection\nfiles appears to have occurred in February 2021 with lures referencing the same period. Some RTF\n[template injection files attributed by security researchers to DoNot Team had compilation](https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/Analysis-of-the-Donot-group%27s-attack-campaign-using-RTF-template-injection-against-the-neighbourhood/)\ntimestamps from 2017, suggesting possible earlier adoption. However, Proofpoint could not verify\nthis group’s usage of the technique dating back several years and note that manipulation of\ncompilation stamps in RTF files is a technique within threat actors’ capabilities.\n\n[Files publicly identified on April 5, 2021 utilize Unicode-signed 16-bit character notation within the](https://twitter.com/ShadowChasing1/status/1387309759217365000)\nRTF file that, when rendered, are revealed to be the remote template injection URL within the RTF\ntemplate property field. This group used this same technique throughout subsequent campaigns\nspanning from April through July 2021. Samples from the campaign utilized “defense proposal”\nlures and appeared to target entities in Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The use of Unicode signed\ncharacter notation provides an obfuscation for the URL value included in the RTF file and is likely\nused by actors as an effort to evade static detection signatures in anti-virus engines. The ability of\nRTF files to parse these signed 16-bit Unicode characters provides actors an alternative to using\nplaintext strings containing a URL, which allows for easy analysis of malicious samples upon\ndetection. A detailed description of how to decode this URL format within DoNot Team files has\nbeen [published by the security analyst Rafa Pedrero following mention of the sample in](https://ciberseguridad.blog/decodificando-ficheros-rtf-maliciosos/)\nopen [source.](https://twitter.com/ShadowChasing1/status/1387309759217365000)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. DoNot Team RTF template injection File Signed 16-Bit Unicode Template URL._\n\nA deeper analysis of the structure of DoNot Team’s RTF template injection files reveals that they\nare including the template formatting property within a preexisting list override table in the RTF file.\nThis table is part of a list of lists within an RTF that governs the formatting of various document\nfeatures including things like headers, footers, and footnotes. In the case of the DoNot Team\nattachment files, the malicious template control word is embedded within the “\\*\\wgrffmtfilter”\ncontrol word enclosing group. This feature is intended to apply a set of filters that will limit the\ndisplayed document style options in Microsoft Word when an RTF file is opened. The\n“wgrffmtfilters” are normally specified by four-digit hexadecimal values. This preexisting\n\n\n-----\n\nhexadecimal value may have informed the threat actor s decision to include the template field in\nthis section, since they [used Unicode-signed 16-bit format to replace an existing hexadecimal](https://manuals.swissmains.com/download/attachments/1376332/Word2007RTFSpec9.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1587628367473&api=v2)\nvalue.\n\nDespite the perceived sophistication in using Unicode encoding within the RTF injection template,\nDoNot Team appears to have struggled to seamlessly integrate the template control word into the\nRTF file for initialization in Microsoft Word. When opening the files in Microsoft Word, a\ndownloading message is displayed which reveals the intended malicious URL along with the\ninvalid document template error message described above. These messages are visible in Figures\n7 and 8. Further the files were altogether lacking social engineering content, displaying a blank\ndocument after the downloading alert and error messages were displayed. Samples analyzed for\nthe purposes of this blog include:\n\n801402ffa0f0db6cc8fc74c68c4b707a625205f25bc2c379f6a8b8329231eb56\n694d433a729b65993dae758e862077c2d82c92018e8e310e121e1fa051567dba\n\n_Figure 7. DoNot Team RTF template injection File Downloading Remote Payload._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. DoNot Team RTF template injection File Document Template Error Message._\n\n## TA423 Adopts RTF Template Injection to Target Malaysia \n\nBetween April and late September 2021, security researchers identified RTF template injection files\nin campaigns targeting entities in Malaysia as well as international companies operating in the\nenergy exploration sector. These files demonstrate a persistent targeting of entities operating in the\nregion utilizing RTF template injection files as phishing attachments. Unlike previously observed\nvariants of files using this technique, these files include remote template injection URLs in plaintext.\nThe URLs referencing external content were plainly visible in the strings of the RTF attachments.\nOf note is that this threat actor also weaponized the RTF files by using a different section of the\ndocument formatting properties than was previously observed among the DoNot Team campaigns.\nThis actor chose to modify a preexisting enclosing group with a font family control word rather than\nthe \"wgrffmtfilters” group previously discussed. Below is an analyzed public sample from July 2021\nfor demonstrative purposes:\n\ndf203b04288af9e0081cd18c7c2daec2bc4686e2e21dcaf415bb70bbd12169a0\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. TA423 RTF template injection File Template Control Word._\n\nThe Malaysian-themed RTF template injection file successfully loaded in Microsoft Word without\ndisplaying error messages or displaying the URL downloading content message. The social\nengineering lure within the document is a simple message impersonating Office 365 that requests\nusers to “Enable Editing” and “Enable Content” for the file. Additionally, it includes a single line\nreferencing the National Palace in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. TA423 Malaysian Themed RTF template injection File Lure._\n\n## Gamaredon Onboards RTF Template Injection Capabilities \n\nAt the beginning of October 2021, Proofpoint researchers identified public samples of Gamaredon\nRTF template injection documents which impersonated the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. This\n[tactic is consistent with reporting on this APT group that links Gamaredon to the Russian FSB](https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-vstanovyla-khakeriv-fsb-yaki-zdiisnyly-ponad-5-tys-kiberatak-na-derzhavni-orhany-ukrainy)\noperating in the Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. The files communicate with the\ndomain pretence77.glorious[.]nonima[.]ru which also was a remote template delivery URL used by\nseveral Microsoft Office Word documents that impersonated Ukrainian government organizations.\nThese Office files communicate with actor infrastructure using a URI pattern previously observed\namong Gamaredon malicious Microsoft Office phishing documents. Specifically, the Microsoft\nOffice documents used remote template injection to retrieve malicious payload files using URIs\nwith the directory “/ELENAPC/principles/” on several occasions. Additionally, in several instances\nthe resources retrieved delivered an MP3 file as a delivery resource.\n\nThe combination of these shared delivery domains, use of known Gamaredon remote template\ninjection document techniques, social engineering lures impersonating governmental organizations\nwithin the groups primary area of responsibility, and the URI patterns across both RTF and Office\ntemplate injection files allowed researchers to attribute the samples to Gamaredon.\n[Researchers note that several of these Office remote template injection documents](https://twitter.com/s1ckb017/status/1445704873345896455)\n[were identified in open-source in relation to Gamaredon on October 6, 2021.](https://twitter.com/s1ckb017/status/1445706513956306950)\n\n_Figure 11. Gamaredon RTF template injection File Lure._\n\nRelated Files and URLs:\n\n\n-----\n\n9525.rtf|a33ccc612a03de4f42a6f5ab5277470f6a7e8ee7abe52725b13704366e8da48b\n9525.doc|8f4a91ecfb9190461459a2d05e5cb944da80ec30a2b1d69f9817ecb431a5ac8f\nedc84bbf13b8300540daf7cd203dc12eede6286a1ac5ce2175031fba3125d354\nЗразок тлг ІСД\nІНТЕРНЕТ.docx|066b2b884b250a3bda4feb19aaa71616c19bf6387ed2767b633521647ada29f8\nАкт\nінсталяції.docx|b9aefe12015489b94e9e7d2cc19fd5e81a471da93a320477f1c8e362344f6bde\nhxxp://pretence77.glorious.nonima[.]ru/ELENAPC/principles/nearly.mp3\nhxxp://intense52.faithful.onihik[.]ru/elenapc/\nhxxp://intense52.faithful.onihik[.]ru/ELENAPC/bikes.conf\n\nThe RTF template injection files observed in use by the Gamaredon group notably includes the\ntemplate control word in the same group as DoNot Team malicious files. Gamaredon similarly\nutilizes the “\\*\\wgrffmtfilter” control word enclosure group that governs document style filters.\nGamaredon, however, opts to include the URL in plaintext rather than using signed 16-bit Unicode\nvalues. Gamaredon’s use of this technique alongside several other attachment delivery methods,\nsuch as Office and XML template documents which all share a single remote template URL,\nsuggests that the actor is experimenting with new file types. The actor may be comparing the\neffectiveness of their efforts that utilize diverse attachment files to gauge the efficacy of their\nphishing tactics as they stage new campaigns. While Proofpoint cannot definitively determine\nwhere Gamaredon may have encountered this RTF template injection technique, the inclusion of\nthe template control word within the style filter section of the document suggests that they may be\nreplicating capabilities encountered in open-source that were previously used as part of the DoNot\nTeam campaigns earlier in 2021.\n\n_Figure 12. Gamaredon RTF template injection File Template Control Word._\n\n## Outlook: Injections are So 2021 \n\nThe viability of XML Office based remote template documents has proven that this type of delivery\nmechanism is a durable and effective method when paired with phishing as an initial delivery\nvector. The innovation by threat actors to bring this method to a new file type in RTFs represents\n\n\n-----\n\nan expanding surface area of threat for organizations worldwide. While this method currently is\nused by a limited number of APT actors with a range of sophistication, the technique’s\neffectiveness combined with its ease of use is likely to drive its adoption further across the threat\nlandscape. Ultimately this is a technique poised for wider adoption in the threat landscape beyond\ntargeted phishing attacks with likely adopters being crimeware actors. While Indian and Chinese\nAPT actors have demonstrated an affinity for RTF file types in the past by using RTF weaponizers\nlike the tool [Royal Road, defenders eventually saw those tools and techniques become widely](https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2020/03/vb2019-paper-attribution-object-using-rtf-object-dimensions-track-apt-phishing-weaponizers/)\nused by less sophisticated actors. This well-established trickle-down pattern may be accelerated in\nthis case based on the minimal effort needed to weaponize RTF attachments before deploying in\nactive phishing campaigns\n\n**ET Signatures**\n\nSID: 2032483 – ET TROJAN DonotGroup Template Download\n\nSID: 2034157 - ET TROJAN Gamaredon Maldoc Remote Template Retrieval (GET)\n\nSID: 2034156 - ET TROJAN Gamaredon Maldoc Remote Template Retrieval (GET)\n\n**YARA Signatures**\n\n**rule Proofpoint_RTFtemplateInjection_Technique_Generic_HTTP_HTTPS**\n\n{\n\nmeta:\n\nauthor = \"Proofpoint Threat Research\"\n\ndescription = \"Detects malicious RTFs using RTF Template Injection to Retrieve\n\nRemote Content from a URL\"\n\ndisclaimer = \"Yara signature created for hunting purposes - not quality controlled\n\nwithin enterprise environment\"\n\nhash1 = \" 43538d9010462668721f178efaeca89f95f6f35a \"\n\nhash2 = \" b5ec74e127ce9dfcb1b3bd9072c1d554b59b4005 \"\n\nstrings:\n\n$rtf = { 7b 5c 72 74 66 } //rtf_bytes\n\n$s1 = \"{\\\\*\\\\template http\" ascii nocase //https_intentionally_not_specified\n\ncondition:\n\n$rtf at 0 and $s1\n\n\n-----\n\n}\n\n**rule Proofpoint_RTFtemplateInjection_Technique_Generic_Unicode_16Bit**\n\n{\n\nmeta:\n\nauthor = \"Proofpoint Threat Research\"\n\ndescription = \"Detects malicious RTFs using RTF Template Injection to Retrieve Remote\n\nContent from Unicode 16 Bit Encoded URL\"\n\ndisclaimer = \"Yara signature created for hunting purposes - not quality controlled\n\nwithin enterprise environment\"\n\nhash1 = \" fbc8064399008fe20f350f0de5e4bbf5833847c7 \"\n\nhash2 = \"6c01fe16e8cffa3049e84707672b82dc32f1cf72 \"\n\nstrings:\n\n$rtf = { 7b 5c 72 74 66 } //rtf_bytes\n\n$s1 = {7B 5C 2A 5C 74 65 6D 70 6C 61 74 65 20 0D 0A 5C 75 2D } //{\\*\\template \\u\ncondition:\n\n$rtf at 0 and $s1\n\n}\n\n## Learn more\n\n[SANS STAR Live Stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyOtkibGro&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqyOtkibGro&feature=youtu.be)\n\n\n-----",
