However, unlike most potentially malicious\ndocuments that get processed in our labs, this file displayed similarities with a set of files\nknown to have been used in separate attacks targeted at different institutions.\n\nOur technical dive into the file lead us to a sophisticated malware framework that uses a\nhandful of novel techniques for command and control identification and communications, as\nwell as a plugin-based architecture, a design choice increasingly being adopted among\nthreat actor groups in the past few years.\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5mP1LqcNWmA\n\nDubbed EHDevel, this operation continues to this date, the latest known victims reportedly\nbeing several Pakistani individuals. In their case, the threat actors have chosen different\nlures than the ones presented in this paper, but the modus operandi is identical. Another\nimportant discovery lies in the fact that this specialized framework that has been used to\ngather field intelligence for years in different shapes and forms, and our threat intelligence\nsuggests a connection with the 2013 Operation Hangover APT as well. Our technical dive\ninto the framework revealed an intricate mix of transitions from one programming language\nto another, code under active development and bugs that were not spotted during the QA\nprocess (if there were any).\n\nMidway through our research, additional technical information and news of EHDevel\n[framework have emerged. You can find a partial technical description of EHDevel over at](http://www.4hou.com/info/news/5760.html)\n[4HOU (warning: Chinese), as well as news on the India/Pakistan cyberattack in a Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-cyber-threat/exclusive-india-and-pakistan-hit-by-spy-malware-cybersecurity-firm-idUSKCN1B80Y2)\nreport.\n\n[Download the whitepaper](https://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/171/Bitdefender-Whitepaper-EHDevel-A4-en-EN.pdf)\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[anti-malware research](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/antimalware-research/) [whitepapers](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/whitepapers/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Alexandru MAXIMCIUC\n\nI'm a veteran security researcher with more than a decade of experience.
