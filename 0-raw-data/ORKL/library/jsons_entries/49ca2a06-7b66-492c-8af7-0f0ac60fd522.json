One tool, a VBA macro targeting\nMicrosoft Outlook, uses the target’s email account to send spearphishing emails to contacts in the victim’s\nMicrosoft Office address book. We also analyzed further Gamaredon tools that have the ability to inject\nmalicious macros and remote templates into existing Office documents.\n\n_Tools linked to Gamaredon and discussed in this blogpost are detected as variants of MSIL/Pterodo,_\n_Win32/Pterodo or Win64/Pterodo by ESET’s products._\n\nThe Gamaredon group has been active since at least 2013. It has been responsible for a number of\n[attacks, mostly against Ukrainian institutions, as evidenced in several reports from](https://cert.gov.ua/news/42) [CERT-UA and from](https://cert.gov.ua/news/46)\nother official Ukrainian bodies over time.\n\nIn the last few months, there has been an increase in activity from this group, with constant waves of\nmalicious emails hitting their targets’ mailboxes. The attachments to these emails are documents with\nmalicious macros that, when executed, try to download a multitude of different malware variants.\n\nGamaredon has leveraged many different programming languages in the past few months, ranging from\nC# to VBScript, batch files and C/C++. The tools used by Gamaredon are very simple and are designed to\ngather sensitive information from compromised systems and to spread further.\n\nContrary to other APT groups, the Gamaredon group seems to make no effort in trying to stay under the\nradar. Even though their tools have the capacity to download and execute arbitrary binaries that could be\nfar stealthier, it seems that this group’s main focus is to spread as far and fast as possible in their target’s\nnetwork while trying to exfiltrate data. Could we be missing something?\n\n## Background\n\nFigure 1 illustrates a typical compromise chain in a Gamaredon campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Typical Gamaredon compromise chain_\n\nWhile most of the recent publications have focused on the spearphishing emails together with the\ndownloaders they contain, this blogpost focuses on the post-compromise tools deployed on these systems.\n\n## Outlook VBA module\n\nThe Gamaredon group uses a package that includes a custom Microsoft Outlook Visual Basic for\nApplications (VBA) project. Using Outlook macros to deliver malware is something we rarely see while\ninvestigating malicious campaigns.\n\nThis bundle of malicious code starts out with a VBScript that first kills the Outlook process if it is running,\nand then removes security around VBA macro execution in Outlook by changing registry values. It also\nsaves to disk the malicious OTM file (Outlook VBA project) that contains a macro, the malicious email\nattachment and, in some cases, a list of recipients that the emails should be sent to.\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, it relaunches Outlook with a special option, /altvba <OTM filename>, which loads the Gamaredon\n[VBA project. The malicious code is executed once the Application.Startup event is received. They have](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/outlook.application.startup)\nbeen using this module in three different ways to send malicious email to:\n\nEveryone in the victim’s address book\nEveryone within the same organization\nA predefined list of targets\n\nWhile abusing a compromised mailbox to send malicious emails without the victim’s consent is not a new\ntechnique, we believe this is the first publicly documented case of an attack group using an OTM file and\nOutlook macro to achieve it.\n\n_Figure 2. Outlook VBA script creating the malicious email_\n\nBased on the “send to all in contact list” behavior of this malicious VBA code, we believe that this module\nmight have led some organizations to think they were targeted by Gamaredon when they were merely\ncollateral damage. For example, recent samples uploaded to VirusTotal coming from regions that are not\n\n\n-----\n\n[traditionally targeted by Gamaredon, such as Japan, could be explained by the actions of this module.](https://blog.trendmicro.co.jp/archives/24285)\n\nAs seen in Figure 2, the VBA code builds the email body and attaches the malicious document to the\nemail. We’ve seen both .docx and .lnk files being used as attachments. These are very similar to the\ncontent of the malicious attachments used in Gamaredon’s initial spearphishing campaigns. Figure 3\nshows an email generated by this malicious component.\n\n_Figure 3. Email generated by the Outlook VBA module with a Word document attachment that contains a remote_\n\n_template_\n\nThe email contains both English and Russian text. However, as illustrated in Figure 3, there is a problem\nwith the Russian encoding. This was fixed in a later version of this module — another example of the\nGamaredon group’s fast development pace and apparent lack of attention to detail.\n\n## Office macro injection module – CodeBuilder\n\n\n-----\n\nWe analyzed different variants of malicious modules used by the Gamaredon group to inject malicious\nmacros or remote templates into documents already present on the compromised system. This is a very\nefficient way of moving laterally within an organization’s network as documents are routinely shared\namongst colleagues. Also, as these macros are run when opening the documents, it is a good way to\npersist on a system as some of these documents are likely to be opened multiple times and at different\ntimes.\n\nThese macro injection modules also have the functionality to tamper with the Microsoft Office macro\nsecurity settings. Thus, affected users have no idea that they are again compromising their workstations\nwhenever they open the documents. We have seen this module implemented in two different languages:\nC# and VBScript.\n\n### C#\n\nThis module was delivered, like many other tools, in a 7z self-extracting archive. Inside, there was a\npassword-protected RAR archive containing a few files. Notably, there were two text files, one for Word\nand one for Excel, containing the VBA source code of the malicious macro to be inserted into the targeted\ndocuments, and the .NET assembly responsible for finding and compromising existing documents. As\nillustrated in Figure 4, the assembly name is CodeBuilder.\n\n_Figure 4. CodeBuilder functions in a version that is not obfuscated_\n\n\n-----\n\nThis .NET module first reduces Office macro security settings for various document types by modifying the\nfollowing registry values:\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\<version>\\<product>\\Security\\VBAWarnings\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\<version>\\<product>\\Security\\AccessVBOM\n\nIt iterates over all possible Office <version> values for both Word and Excel <product> values. It then\nscans for documents with valid Word or Excel file extensions on all drives connected to the system. For the\ndrive containing the Windows installation, it scans only specific locations, namely the Desktop and\nDownloads folders. For the others, it scans the entire drive. The malware moves each located document\ninto the AppData folder, inserts malicious Word or Excel macros into it using a Microsoft.Office.Interop\nobject, and then moves the document back into its original folder. In the samples we analyzed, the injected\nmacros were simple downloaders.\n\n### Batch file/VBScript\n\nThe VBScript version of this module is similar in behavior to the .NET one. The main difference is that\ninstead of inserting a malicious macro into existing documents, it inserts references to a remote template\ninto them.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. VBScript using the Document.AttachedTemplate property to inject a reference to a remote template into_\n\n_existing documents_\n\nThis VBScript module also comes packaged in a self-extracting archive, containing one batch file and two\nVBS files responsible for iterating through documents and adding the remote template references to them.\n\n## Module updates\n\n[Interestingly, some of the custom tools described in Palo Alto Networks’ 2017 blogpost on Gamaredon are](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-title-gamaredon-group-toolset-evolution/)\nstill being updated and in use today. Some show significant similarities while others are rewrites in different\ncoding languages. The most prevalent tools downloaded and installed on compromised machines can be\nbroadly grouped into two different categories: downloaders and backdoors.\n\n### Downloaders\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are many variations of their downloaders, most of them written in either C# or VBScript. This section\nwill cover only two of their most original variants; the others have not evolved that much and are very\nsimple.\n\n**_C# compiler module_**\n\nThis .NET executable, similar to many other tools used by the Gamaredon group, uses obfuscation\ntechniques such as junk code insertion and string obfuscation. It contains in its body the base64-encoded\nsource code of a downloader. It decodes that source code and compiles it directly on the system using the\nbuilt-in Microsoft.CSharp.CSharpCodeProvider class. It places the resulting executable in an existing\ndirectory and creates a scheduled task that will launch it every 10 minutes. As can be seen in Figure 6, the\ndecoded source code still has comments in it, illustrating the apparent sloppiness of Gamaredon’s\noperators.\n\n_Figure 6. Part of the C# downloader source code included in the C# compiler module_\n\n**_GitHub project module_**\n\n\n-----\n\nAs seen in Figure 7, this .NET executable uses a GitHub repository to obtain and execute a downloader.\nThis repository is now gone, but we were able to download a copy of it while it was still available.\n\n_Figure 7. .NET module responsible for downloading and executing a payload stored on github.com_\n\nThe repository contained a single file — readme.txt — that was a base64-encoded .NET downloader\nexecutable. The role of the GitHub project module is to download this file, decode it and execute it.\n\n### Backdoors – file stealers\n\nWhile some variations exist in functionalities, the main purpose of these modules is to enumerate all\ndocuments on a compromised system and upload them to the C&C server. These file stealers can also\ndownload and execute arbitrary code from the C&C server. As with many other tools used by the\nGamaredon group, they come in four different coding languages: C/C++, C#, batch file and VBScript.\n\n**_C/C++_**\n\n\n-----\n\n[This variant is the successor of the USBStealer module described here. Although the latest versions are](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-title-gamaredon-group-toolset-evolution/)\nnow quite different, examining samples of this module throughout its development clearly shows it\noriginates from the same source code.\n\nOne sample that illustrates this shift well is a 64-bit DLL with internal name Harvesterx64.dll, compiled in\nJune 2019. It still has most of the strings used in the older variants, but also exhibits two improvements that\nare still in the newer ones. First, it now resolves Windows APIs via name hashing and second, it uses a\nbasic text file instead of a SQLite database to track which files were already uploaded to the C&C server.\n\nThe behavior of this module is quite straightforward: it scans the system for new Microsoft Office\ndocuments, both on local and removable drives, and uploads them to the C&C server. To know whether the\ndocument is new, the module keeps, in a text file, one MD5 hash per file uploaded to the server. These\nMD5 hashes are not based on the file content, but rather on a string composed of the file name, its size\nand its last modified time. The module’s strings are stored in its .data section, encrypted with a simple XOR\nkey. It also has the ability to download and execute arbitrary code from its C&C server.\n\n**_C#_**\n\nThis is a reimplementation in C# of the C/C++ version. The major difference is that it also takes\nscreenshots of the compromised computer every minute. As seen in Figure 8, the version we analyzed has\nfive different threads with evocative names.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. C# backdoor thread creation routine_\n\n**_Batch file/VBScript_**\n\nThis version comprises several scripts, written in both batch file form and VBScript. The ultimate goal is the\nsame, though: scanning the system for sensitive documents. The main mechanism is a batch file that\nsearches for Word documents (*.doc*) on the system and stores their names in a text file (see Figure 9).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9.Example inject.txt file containing the result of the backdoor’s document file scan_\n\nThe package also contains encrypted script files named 1.log, 2.log, 3.log, 4.log and 5.log. Once\ndecrypted, these scripts are obfuscated VBScript downloaders that are able to download and execute\narbitrary code.\n\n## Network infrastructure\n\nThe Gamaredon group uses many different domains, both free and paid, for its C&C servers. Free domains\nare mostly DDNS from No-IP: hopto.org, ddns.net, myftp.biz, while paid domains are registered through the\nREG.RU registrar and include the .fun, .site, .space, .ru, .website and .xyz TLDs.\n\nThey are constantly changing the domains used by their tools, but mostly on a small number of ASNs.\nCareful analysis suggests they use separate domains for small groups of victims. Please check ESET’s\nGitHub account for an extensive list of domains used by the Gamaredon group.\n\n## Quality of execution\n\n\n-----\n\nWe were able to collect numerous different samples of malicious scripts, executables and documents used\nby the Gamaredon group throughout their campaigns. We noticed several mistakes in these, especially in\nscripts. It is of course impossible to know the exact reason behind these bugs or oversights, but the volume\nof samples the group produces and their rapid development could explain it. The fact that there were\ncomments left in the source code included in some C# compiler module samples or that the Russian\nencoding was wrong in email generated by the Outlook VBA module shows that there is no stringent\nreview or testing before releasing their many tools and using them in the wild.\n\nHowever, while these errors might lower their tools’ overall effectiveness, this group’s rapid execution and\nadaptation also has some advantages. The volume and relentlessness of the attacks can create a state of\nconstant dread in their targets. And although the code is very simple, some techniques, such as script\nobfuscation, make it hard to fully automate the analysis, making the analyst’s job tedious.\n\nTheir GitHub project allowed us a glimpse into the rapid development of their tools. The code that was\ncommitted there clearly showed the evolution of the C# downloader. The first versions showed no signs of\nobfuscation; then the developers added different string obfuscations and junk code to make the analysis\nharder.\n\nIn terms of persistence, several different techniques are used, but the most common ones are scheduled\ntasks, autorun registry keys and leveraging the Startup folder. Although these techniques are very simple\nand have been known for a long time, the Gamaredon group’s strategy of trying to install multiple scripts\nand executables on each system, and constantly updating them, significantly complicates the defender’s\nlives.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite the simplicity of most of their tools, the Gamaredon group also is capable of deploying some\nnovelty, such as their Outlook VBA module. However, as it is far from stealthy, in the long run it is no match\nfor a capable organization. The variety of tools Gamaredon has at its disposal can be very effective at\nfingerprinting a machine and understanding what sensitive data is available, then spreading throughout the\nnetwork. Could this just be a way to deploy a much stealthier payload?\n\n_[Special thanks to ESET Senior Malware Researcher Anton Cherepanov for his help in this research.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/author/acherepanov/)_\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n**SHA-1** **ESET detection name** **Comments**\n\n6F75F2490186225C922FE605953038BDEB537FEE DOC/TrojanDownloader.Agent.ARJ Outlook\nVBA\nmodule\n\nDFC941F365E065187B5C4A4BF42E770035920856 Win32/Pterodo.XG.gen C# Office\nmacro\ninjection\nmodule\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA-1** **ESET detection name** **Comments**\n\n9AFC9D6D72F78B2EB72C5F2B87BDC7D59C1A14ED Win32/Pterodo.ZM Batch file/‌\nVBScript\nOffice\nmacro\ninjection\nmodule\n\n3DD83D7123AEFBE5579C9DC9CF3E68BCAFC9E65E MSIL/Pterodo.CD C#\ncompiler\nmodule\n\n941F341770B67F9E8EE811B4B8383101F35B27CD MSIL/Pterodo.CA GitHub\nproject\nmodule\n\nDC8BD2F65FD2199CE402C76A632A9743672EFE2D Win32/Pterodo.XC C/C++\nbackdoor\n\n336C1244674BB378F041E9064EA127E9E077D59D MSIL/Pterodo.DP C#\nbackdoor\n\n5FC1B6A55A9F5A52422872A8E34A284CDBDD0526 Win32/Pterodo.YE Batch file/‌\nVBScript\nbackdoor\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n\nInitial\nAccess\n\n\n[T1193](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193/) Spearphishing Attachment Gamaredon group sends emails\nwith malicious attachments to its\ntargets.\n\n\n[T1199](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199/) Trusted Relationship Gamaredon group malware\nabuses a compromised\norganization’s email accounts\nto send emails with malicious\nattachments to the victim’s\ncontacts.\n\nExecution [T1064](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064/) Scripting Gamaredon group uses scripting\nheavily, mostly Batch files and\nVBScript.\n\n[T1085](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1085/) Rundll32 Gamaredon group malware\nuses rundll32 to launch\nmalicious DLLs, for example\nthe C/C++ backdoor.\n\n\n[T1106](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106/) Execution through\nAPI\n\n\nGamaredon group malware\nuses CreateProcess to launch\nadditional components, for\nexample to execute payloads\nreceived from its C&C servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n[T1204](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) User Execution Initial compromise by the\nGamaredon group usually\nrequires the user to execute a\nmalicious email attachment.\n\nPersistence [T1053](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/) Scheduled Task Gamaredon group malware\nregisters several of its modules\n(downloaders, backdoors, etc.) as\nscheduled tasks.\n\n\n[T1060](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1060/) Registry Run Keys /\nStartup Folder\n\n[T1137](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/) Office Application\nStartup\n\n\nGamaredon group uses Run\nkeys and the Startup folder to\nensure its modules are\nexecuted at every reboot.\n\nGamaredon group malware\ninserts malicious macros into\nexisting documents, providing\npersistence when they are\nreopened.\n\n\nDefense\nEvasion\n\n\n[T1027](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/) Obfuscated Files or\nInformation\n\n\nGamaredon group makes heavy\nuse of compressed archives,\nsome password protected, to\ndeliver its malicious payloads.\nStrings are routinely obfuscated\nor encrypted in these malicious\nmodules.\n\n\n[T1112](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/) Modify Registry Gamaredon group malware\nmodifies several registry keys\nto deactivate security\nmechanisms in Microsoft\nOffice related to macros.\n\n[T1116](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1116/) Code Signing Gamaredon group uses\nsigned binaries in its malicious\ncampaigns.
