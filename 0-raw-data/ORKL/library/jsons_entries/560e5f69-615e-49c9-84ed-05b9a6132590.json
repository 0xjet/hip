    "plain_text": "# Saber Lions Organization (APT-C-38) Attacks Uncovered\n\n**blogs.360.cn/post/analysis-of-APT-C-38.html**\n\nMay 27, 2019\n\n# Saber lion organization (APT-C-38) attack activity revealed\n\n I. Overview\n\nSince July 2015, the Army Lions Organization (APT-C-38) has launched an organized,\nplanned and targeted uninterrupted attack in the Middle East. Its attack platform is\nWindows and Android. Up to now, 360 Beaconlab has captured 25 Android platform\nattack samples, 4 Windows platform attack samples, and 16 C2 domain names.\n\nIn May 2018, Kaspersky security vendor published the report \" [Who's who in the Zoo \",](https://securelist.com/whos-who-in-the-zoo/85394/)\nthe first time to disclose the organization as an unaffiliated espionage organization\nfocused on the Middle East target, and named ZooPark, the attack weapon involved\ncontains four iterations The version of the Android-side RAT, load delivery methods\ninclude puddles and Telegram channels.\n\nIn 2019, 360 Campfire Lab captured the latest attack activity of the Saber Lions\norganization. In addition to discovering Android-side attacks, it also found that the\norganization had Windows-side attacks, and the Android-side RAT still belongs to the\nfourth generation. We combine the geopolitical factors of the APT attack, the language\nused by the attacking organization, and the historical attack activities initiated by the\norganization. The analysis considers the organization to be an APT organization in the\nbackground of a country in the Middle East in West Asia. In addition, we would like to\n**thank our brother team----360 Advanced Threat Response Team for the completion**\nof the Windows side RAT content of this report.\n\nBecause of the main target of the Saber-Like organization, the Kurdish target is a\nKurdish country in the Middle East and West Asia. In addition, the Windows side RAT\ncontains multiple \"Saber\" under the PDB path, and the Asian lion is the representative\nanimal of the Middle East. Some of the other characteristics of the organization and the\n360 naming rules for the APT organization, we named the organization the Saber Lion\n(APT-C-38).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1.1 The time of the key attack activity of the saber lion\n\n# Second, load delivery and network infrastructure\n\nThe way the saber lion organizes the payload delivery is mainly the puddle attack and\nthe Telegram channel. It should be noted that after the organization was first leaked in\nearly May 2018, the attacking organization used a new batch of network infrastructure at\nthe end of the month.\n\n**- Puddle attack**\n\nTwo Arab news newspaper websites (Annahar, Kuwait and Al-Nahar, Egypt), which are\npopular in the Middle East, have been found to have been used by the organization for\npuddle attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2.1 Egypt Al-Nahar website\n\n**- Telegram channel**\n\nIn addition to the above two puddle attacks against the designated Arab countries in the\nMiddle East, we also found that the organization used the Telegram channel to spread\nthe Kurdish people in the Middle East when attacking its main target (such as the\nelection of the Kurdistan Province before the Islamic Parliament). Attacks and attacks in\nthe Kurwana Nanda quarter of Kurdistan Province, etc.).\n\nFigure 2.2 Telegram channel against the Kurdish provincial elections before the Islamic\nParliament\n\n**- Network infrastructure**\n\nTo date, the Saber Lions organization has used multiple network infrastructures.\n\nTable 1 Network infrastructure used by the Army Lions organization\n\n\nRhubarb2.com C2 server IR'Sanan\ndaj\n\nRhubarb3.com C2 server Privacy‐\nProtect\n\n\n+98.9303938251 Pilton86\n[@yahoo.‐](mailto:pilton86@yahoo.com)\ncom\n\nPrivacyProtect Privacy‐\nProtect\n\n\n6614478527\n\nPrivacyPro‐\ntect\n\n9865214523\n\n1663976888\n\n\nAndroidup‐\ndaters.com\n\n\nIntermediate\nservice(im‐\nage)\n\n\nIR'Tehran +98.2188561212 Asghark‐\n[hof@gma](mailto:asgharkhof@gmail.com)\nil.com\n\nIR'Tehran +98.2188888299 Silent.c‐\n[ity2020@](mailto:silent.city2020@mail.com)\nmail.com\n\n\nDlgmail.com Intermediate\nservice(im‐\nage)\n\n\n-----\n\nDlstubes.com Intermediate\nservice(im‐\nage)\n\n\n1558738817\n\n1558738817\n\n1558738817\n\n11155679\n\n1771798635\n\n2417682380\n\n\nGoogleupda‐\ntors.com\n\nAdobeactive‐\nupdates.com\n\nAdobeseup‐\ndater.com\n\n\nIntermediate\nservice(im‐\nage)\n\nIntermediate\nservice(im‐\nage)\n\nIntermediate\nservice(im‐\nage)\n\n\nDlstube.com Intermediate\nservice(im‐\nage)\n\n\nAdobeactive‐\nupdate.com\n\n\nIntermediate\nservice(im‐\nage)\n\n\nIR +98.8877588798 Bold‐\n[man.sam](mailto:boldman.sam@mail.com)\n@mail.‐\ncom\n\nIR +98.8877588798 Bold‐\n[man.sam](mailto:boldman.sam@mail.com)\n@mail.‐\ncom\n\nIR +98.8877588798 Bold‐\n[man.sam](mailto:boldman.sam@mail.com)\n@mail.‐\ncom\n\nIR'Tehran +98.2177888991 Bold‐\n[man.sam](mailto:boldman.sam@mail.com)\n@mail.‐\ncom\n\nIR'Tehran +98.2122694575 Kimkallia\n[n@gmail.](mailto:kimkallian@gmail.com)\ncom\n\nIR'Tehran +98.9106145178 Sirus_viru\n[s6688@y](mailto:sirus_virus6688@yahoo.com)\nahoo.com\n\n\n5.61.27.154 Null Null Null Null Null\n\n5.61.27.157 Null Null Null Null Null\n\n5.61.27.173 Null Null Null Null Null\n\n91.109.23.175 Null Null Null Null Null\n\nIt should be noted that on May 23, 2018, a new batch of network infrastructure was\napplied. The latest mobile attack load was deployed in one of the servers in March 2019.\nThere are 4 intermediate servers and 3 of them. It still survives and resolves to the same\nIP, and these servers act as intermediate servers for the PC and mobile RATs.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2.3 A batch of network infrastructure newly deployed by the Saber Lions\norganization in the month after being disclosed\n\n# Third, the way of induction\n\nThe Saber lion organization mainly uses the following two induction methods in this\noperation:\n\n**- Camouflage with normal APP function**\n\nFor better avoidance, it is noticed that in addition to masquerading the file icon, the\nnormal APP interface will be displayed when the RAT starts. Currently, the four-initiative\nversion of the Android RAT will display the normal interface after running, but Espionage\nin the background is turned on at runtime or when a specified broadcast is received.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3.1 Second and fourth generation Android RAT post-run demonstration examples\n\n**- File icon camouflage**\n\nFigure 3.2 Disguised application software icon\n\n# Fourth, RAT attack sample analysis\n\nAs of now, the Saber has been using different RATs for Android and Windows platforms.\nAfter analysis, we believe that the latest Android RAT and PC RAT should be purchased\nfrom the same commercial development organization, one of the developers nicknamed\n\"Apasec \".\n\n**- Android**\n\nThe Android side uses a total of four iterations of the RAT. In this report, we only\nintroduce the fourth-generation RAT used by the latest attack activities. We are called\nUnitMM. The RAT is currently only available in the saber lion organization. For other\nversions of the RAT, refer to the information. The Kaspersky Security Vendor Report\nmentioned earlier in this report.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe fourth generation RAT of the UnitMM Saber Lion organization. We named it UnitMM\nbased on the class name and database name used by the RAT. The latest version of\nUnitMM controls dozens of feature configurations to steal SMS, contacts, geolocation,\nbrowser bookmarks and search history, clipboard information, externally specified\napplication data, capture photos/video/audio A variety of malicious behaviors.\n\nIn addition, UnitMM can also interact in response to specified instructions from C2.\n\nTable 2 C2 instruction and function correspondence table\n\n2 Update malicious feature configuration\n\n4 Execute shell command\n\n6 Compress and save the specified file/folder to the default directory\n\n8 Write the task content to a temporary zip file, extract all the content from it and\ndelete it\n\n10 Copy the specified file/folder to the specified directory\n\n12 Move the specified file/folder to the specified directory\n\n14 Rename the specified file/folder\n\n16 Delete specified file/folder\n\n18 Create the specified directory\n\n20 Silently send the specified content message to the specified number\n\n\ntwenty\ntwo\n\ntwenty\nfour\n\n\nDial the specified number\n\nGet the file list information under the specified path and save it to the default\ndirectory\n\n\n26 Update intermediate server (C2 steganographic picture) list\n\n**- Windows**\n\nA RAT has been discovered on the Windows side. We have been named SpecialSaber.\nThe RAT is currently only available in the Army Lions organization, with a total of four.\n\nSpecialSaber This is a RAT that has not been exposed before. According to the directory\nname under the latest version of the PDB path, we are named SpecialSaber. It has\ndetection and killing (including Bitdefender, Kaspersky, Avira, Avast, AVG, ClamWin,\nESET, Norton, McAfee, Panda, Symantec), stealing a variety of browser information, a\nvariety of mailbox information, user account information, disk file information, etc. With a\nvariety of malicious behaviors such as keyloggers and screenshots. After stealing\nvarious information, it will be saved in the file's own working directory. The file name is\nrandomly generated š string, and the file is stored in the specified format.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4.1 Example of a screenshot file stored in a uniform format\n\nTable 3 Table of some file type values and file meanings\n\n1 Screenshot, jpeg format\n\n2 A list of all files for each drive, including directory, file name, file size information\n\n3 Keylogger\n\n4 Account password information for FireFox, Chrome, IE, Opera, Safari, Thunder‐\nbird, Outlook\n\n5 History of FireFox, Chrome, IE, Opera, Safari\n\n6 Bookmark information for FireFox, Chrome, IE, Opera, Safari\n\n7 Yahoo Messenger account password information\n\n8 User account list and details for each account\n\n9 Logical drive size, free space and drive letter\n\n10 Complete TCP/IP configuration for all adapters\n\n14 Zip compressed file\n\n\ntwenty\nfour\n\n\nDetailed configuration information of the operating system, including soft kill in‐\nformation, product ID, hardware attributes, etc.\n\n\nIn addition, SpecialSaber can also interact in response to specified instructions from C2.\n\nTable 4 Part C2 instruction and function correspondence table\n\n3 Create the specified directory\n\n4 Rename the specified file/folder\n\n6 file download\n\n\n-----\n\n7 File compression encryption (Zip, AES)\n\n10 Get account password information for FireFox, Chrome, IE, Opera, Safari, Thunder‐\nbird, Outlook\n\n11 Get bookmark information for FireFox, Chrome, IE, Opera, Safari\n\n12 Get the history of FireFox, Chrome, IE, Opera, Safari\n\n14 Get the name of the uninstaller list\n\n16 Get the size of the logical drive, the remaining space and the drive letter\n\n17 Get full TCP/IP configuration for all adapters\n\n18 Get a list of user accounts and details for each account\n\n25 Get Yahoo Messenger account password information\n\n**- Suspected to be purchased from the same commercial development company**\n\nBy comparing the UnitMM RAT on the Android side with the SpecialSaber RAT on the\nWindows side, we see that the two adopt a similar approach in the C2 communication\nlink, and the information stolen by the two has a special commonality. We think that the\ntwo should come from the same business. Development organization.\n\nIn addition, we found a developer named \"Apasec\" in the path of a PDB. We found that\nthe name appeared in the C2 panels of the organization's mobile terminal many times.\nThis finding further verifies our judgment.\n\n# V. Distribution of the attacked area\n\nUp to now, 360 Campfire Labs has found that there are 7 countries affected by the attack\nof the Saber Lions, of which Iran is the most affected. This is related to the attack on the\nKurds who found the country during our analysis. It doesn't matter.\n\nFigure 5.1 Distribution of the attacked area\n\n\n-----\n\n# Sixth, the attacker portrait\n\nBased on the attacker's special attacks on the attack, the language used, and the\ngeopolitical factors of the APT attack, we summarized the following views of the attack\norganization:\n\nFamiliar with Persian, Arabic, with Persian being the most frequently used.\nIt is mainly aimed at Kurdish people in a certain province in the Middle East in\nWest Asia. It can deploy attacks on activities at certain moments in real time and\neven in advance, and it also targets several Arab countries in the Middle East.\nAPT attacks are mostly based on internal and geopolitical factors (national or\nhostile).\nFrom the perspective of the victim's background and the duration of the attack, the\ntarget of the attacker's focus is significant at the political and strategic level and\nlasts longer.\n\nIn summary, 360 Campfire Lab believes that the attacker is an APT organization from a\ncountry in the Middle East in West Asia.\n\n# Seven, summary\n\nIn recent years, we have seen that APT attacks have evolved with the times. The PC\nside is no longer a unique target. More and more attack organizations will also use the\nmobile end as another necessary target for attacks, and even invest frequently. The\ncyber war under the background of some countries in the Middle East and the AsiaPacific region.\n\nAPT attacks are developing rapidly, especially the development of mobile attacks. We\nhave seen that some of the attacking organizations in the past few years are still\nrelatively rudimentary. Even some security vendors use kittens and other names to name\nthem to show low respect for the attacking capabilities of the corresponding attacking\norganizations. However, as the attack gains value and the attack organization increases\nits investment, we see that the attack is more and more complex, and the pertinence and\neffectiveness are getting stronger. If the former kitten is used as an example, it is like a\nyoung one. The kitten gradually became a mature lion. This saber lion organization is\nundoubtedly a typical representative of the development of APT attacks. Based on the\nspecial background of the organization and the current situation of its affiliated countries,\nwe believe that the organization's attack may have a new round of changes.\n\n_Appendix A: Sample MD5_\n\n\n-----\n\nAndroid攻击样本MD5          Windows攻击样本MD5\n0745b0957aab92b6a09645e076b4f339  5b0431bbebdc48d2fa37882f7343b011\n1874aa71c9b13eec5b587e8ed6a71606  31edb7591bfeeb72e0652c17781640af\n191cc5d165472ae19e665821be71c282  58cc3935fbfdb2990304b99fbb919dad\n232bd3dde6914db0a3dbfc21ed178887  848193568a48f5742135667e9842890a\n2d91f7d1eb0d32ece0a8b1715a70b4cd\n345c2325dd633099f29b6d7141a4703d\n451ff729eaa1cf26943a812cd37eb4ac\n4d8ddec9243bc6ac0419c561fe413cfc\n519018ecfc50c0cf6cd0c88cc41b2a69\n5ad36f6dd060e52771a8e4a1dd90c50c\n5efddd7f0fc2125e78a2ca18b68464ec\n699a7eedd244f402303bcffdee1f0ed1\n6a388edbce88bb0331ae875ceeb2f319\n73b0a3cae8510dd2efeca7d22f730706\n7b530999847bbf43e7d6cbb76da684ae\n7d7ad116e6a42d4e518378e2313e9392\na7d00c8629079f944b61c4dd5c77c8fb\na856f9de281cadad7142828dda3843b4\nac4402e04de0949d7beed975db84e594\nb44b91b14f176fbf93d998141931a4aa\nb714b092d2f28fcf78ef8d02b46dbf9c\nc7e4d75caa8e07847e47eadce229c288\ncb67abd070ae188390fc040cbe60e677\ne2f62b5acf3795a62e9d54e1301c4e7b\nec5a6f0e743f4b858aba9de96a33fb0c\n\n_Appendix B: C&C_\n\nrhubarb2.com\nrhubarb3.com\nandroidupdaters.com\ndlgmail.com\ndlstubes.com\ngoogleupdators.com\nadobeactiveupdates.com\nadobeseupdater.com\ndlstube.com\nadobeactiveupdate.com\n5.61.27.154\n5.61.27.157\n5.61.27.173\n91.109.23.175\nsolar64.xp3.biz\nentekhab10.xp3.biz\n\n_Appendix C: PDB_\n\nC:\\Users\\apasec110\\Desktop\\Saber1\\client\\Saber1-Develop\\Release\\Saber1Dev.pdb\nC:\\Users\\apasec110\\Desktop\\Saber1\\client\\editing saber\\Saber1-Developchanged\\Release\\Saber1-Dev.pdb\nC:\\Users\\M&M\\Desktop\\Saber1\\Special-Saber1-Windows-Clientbinder_backup(last stable socket communication)\\Release\\Saber1-Dev.pdb\nC:\\Users\\M&M\\Desktop\\Saber1\\Special-Saber1-Windows-Clientbinder_backup\\Release\\Saber1-Dev.pdb\n\n_Appendix D: Reference Links_\n\n\n-----\n\n[1] https:\n\n[2] https:\n\n[3] https:\n\n[4] https:\n\n[5] https:\n\nThis article links: [http://blogs.360.cn/post/analysis-of-APT-C-38.html](http://blogs.360.cn/post/analysis-of-APT-C-38.html)\n\n-- EOF -\nAuthor published in 2019-05-27 10:15:30, added classification under and added ' ' label,\nlast modified 2019-05-27 11:04:14 [360烽火实验室（360 Beaconlab）](http://blogs.360.cn/author/zhanghao-ms) [移动端技术](http://blogs.360.cn/cate/%E7%A7%BB%E5%8A%A8%E7%AB%AF%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF) android\n\n平台 [APT](http://blogs.360.cn/cate/apt-report) [Android](http://blogs.360.cn/cate/Android) [360mobile](http://blogs.360.cn/tag/360mobile)\n\n\n-----",
