The group uses an arsenal of homemade\nmalware tools and techniques to execute and conceal its campaigns on PC and Mobile OS.\n\n#FalconsAPT is the 1st known campaign to be fully developed by Arabic #hackers to\ntarget the Middle East #TheSAS2015\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fthe-desert-falcons-targeted-attacks%2F68817%2F&text=%23FalconsAPT+is+the+1st+known+campaign+to+be+fully+developed+by+Arabic+%23hackers+to+target+the+Middle+East+%23TheSAS2015)\n\nThe first Desert Falcons operations were seen in 2011 and the group made its first infections\nin 2013.
