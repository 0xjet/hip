An additional update in July added indexing of stolen data, making the group’s data\nleak website(s) searchable by parameters including keywords and file types.\n\nBut the group did not stop there. In August, Symantec says it observed an updated version\nof the Exmatter data exfiltration tool being used alongside ALPHV/BlackCat/Noberus in\nattacks – this had previously been seen being used alongside the BlackMatter ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nwhich is designed to steal specific file types from selected directories and upload them to the\nattacker’s server prior to deployment of the ransomware.\n\nAs of this summer, Exmatter includes refinements to the types of files it steals, the addition of\nfile transfer protocol (FTP) capabilities in addition to SFTO and WebDav, the ability to create\nreports listing processed files, the ability to corrupt them, and a self-destruct option, among\nother things. It has also been extensively rewritten, possibly in a bid to avoid detection.\n\nOne ALPHV/BlackCat/Noberus affiliate has also been observed using the Eamfo infostealer\nto target credentials stored by Veeam backup software – it does this by connecting to the\nVeeam SQL database and making a specific query, and may also have been used by\nLockBit and [Yanluowang.](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252524873/Cisco-confirms-leaked-data-was-stolen-in-Yanluowang-ransomware-hit)\n\nTargeting Veeam for credential theft is an established technique that comes in handy from a\nmalicious point of view because it enables privilege escalation and lateral movement, and\ntherefore gives one more access to data to steal and encrypt.\n\n“There’s no doubt that Coreid is one of the most dangerous and active ransomware\ndevelopers operating at the moment,” wrote the Symantec team.\n\n“The group has been around since 2012 and became well-known for using its Carbanak\nmalware to steal money from organisations worldwide, with the banking, hospitality and retail\n[sectors among its preferred targets. Three members of the group were arrested in 2018, and](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252446153/Three-Carbanak-cyber-heist-gang-members-arrested)\nin 2020 the group changed its tactics and launched its ransomware-as-a-service operation.\n\n“Its continuous development of its ransomware and its affiliate programs indicates that this\nsophisticated and well-resourced attacker has little intention of going anywhere anytime\nsoon,” they said.\n\n**Read more about ransomware**\n\nCurrent and former CISA members say the best methods for curbing ransomware\n[attacks are organisations reporting attacks and assisting in investigations.](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/252524998/Transparency-disclosure-key-to-fighting-ransomware)\nPrevention and protection are often the focus of ransomware discussions, but IT teams\nmust understand ransomware's effects on operations and how to react in an attack\nscenario.\n\n**Read more on Hackers and cybercrime prevention**\n\n\n-----\n\nVice Society cyber gang targeted multiple UK schools\n\nBy: Alex Scroxton\n\nVice Society ransomware 'persistent threat' to education sector\n\nBy: Arielle Waldman\n\n\n-----\n\nLockBit ransomware activity nose-dived in October\n\nBy: Shaun Nichols\n\nRansomware crews regrouping as LockBit rise continues\n\nBy: Alex Scroxton\n\nLatest News\n\n[Tech Nation to shutter after more than a decade](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/365529739/Tech-Nation-to-shutter-after-more-than-a-decade)\n[Cyber training firm launches £20k data protection scholarship](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/365529972/Cyber-training-firm-launches-20k-data-protection-scholarship)\n[Russian DDoS hacktivists seen targeting western hospitals](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/365529957/Russian-DDoS-hacktivists-seen-targeting-western-hospitals)\n\n\n-----\n\n[View All News](https://www.computerweekly.com/news)\n\nDownload Computer Weekly\n\nIn The Current Issue:\n\nHow the cost-of-living crisis is affecting IT\nReverse cloud migrations: shifting IT back on-premise\n[Download Current Issue](https://www.computerweekly.com/ezine/Computer-Weekly/How-the-cost-of-living-crisis-is-affecting-IT)\n\n\n-----",
