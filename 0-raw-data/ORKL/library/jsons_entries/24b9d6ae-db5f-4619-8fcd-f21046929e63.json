This Group’s methods tend to be spear-phishing emails\n\nwith malicious PDF attachments or web links to binary executables\n\n\nwith a Poison Ivy remote administration tool (RAT) payload. The\n\nGroup’s targeted victims included China/US relations experts,\n\n\nDefense entities, and the Geospatial industry. Zscaler detected\n\nrepeated infections from this Group to a customer related to this\n\n\ntarget list. The following report summarizes the incident details to\n\nincrease awareness of these attacks in order to increase detection,\n\nresponse, and prevention. A much more detailed report has been\n\n\n##### This Group’s\n\n# “ methods tend to\n\n##### be spear-phishing emails with malicious PDF attachments or web links to binary executables with a (RAT) payload.\n\n -Zscaler ThreatLabZ\n\n\nprovided to impacted parties, stakeholders, and other trusted\n\ngroups dealing with these incidents. The larger report dives into\n\n\nmore details about the command and control servers (C&Cs)\n\nbeing used by this Group. If you are working on similar research\n\nwould like to collaborate, please contact threatlabz@zscaler.com\n\n\nand we will share the detailed report with select entities.\n\n###### Introduction\n\n\nZscaler provides inline security and policy enforcement of web\n\nand email transactions to include full-content inspection and\n\n\ncomprehensive transaction logging and analysis. Given that\n\nmany of Zscaler’s customers are large enterprises, it is not\n\nsurprising that some have been the target of so called Advanced\n\n\n##### The Group’s\n\n# “ targeted victims\n\n##### included China/US relations experts, Defense entities, and the Geospatial industry.\n\n -Zscaler ThreatLabZ\n\n\nPersistent Threats (APTs). During the course of our daily activities\n\nresearching various threats, Zscaler ThreatlabZ often uncovers\n\n\ninfected hosts that we believe have been compromised via\n\nattacks that bear the signature of an APT attack. While there is no\n\n\nuniversally accepted definition of APT attacks, for the purposes\n\nof this paper we will leverage Richard Bejtlich’s blog post on the\n\n\nsubject[1].\n\n**1. http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2010/01/what-is-apt-and-what-does-it-want.html**\n\n\n© 2011 Zscaler All Rights Reserved Page 2\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Alleged APT Intrusion Set: 1.php Group\n\n- Advanced means the adversary can operate in the full spectrum\n\n\nof computer intrusion. They can use the most pedestrian\n\npublicly available exploit against a well-known vulnerability, or\n\n\nthey can elevate their game to research new vulnerabilities and\n\ndevelop custom exploits, depending on the target’s posture.\n\n\n\n- Persistent means the adversary is formally tasked to\n\naccomplish a mission. They are not opportunistic intruders. Like\n\n\nan intelligence unit they receive directives and work to satisfy\n\ntheir masters. Persistent does not necessarily mean they need\n\n\nto constantly execute malicious code on victim computers.\n\nRather, they maintain the level of interaction needed to execute\n\n\n#####    …the adversary\n\n# “ here is a threat\n\n##### because it is organized and funded and motivated. Some people speak of multiple “groups” consisting of dedicated “crews” with various missions.\n\n -Richard Bejtlich, TaoSecurity blog\n\n\ntheir objectives.\n\n\n\n- **Threat means the adversary is not a piece of mindless code.**\n\nThis point is crucial. Some people throw around the term\n\n\n“threat” with reference to malware. If malware had no human\n\nattached to it (someone to control the victim, read the stolen\n\n\ndata, etc.), then most malware would be of little worry (as long\n\nas it didn’t degrade or deny data). Rather, the adversary here\n\nis a threat because it is organized and funded and motivated.\n\n\nSome people speak of multiple “groups” consisting of\n\n\ndedicated “crews” with various missions.\n\n© 2011 Zscaler All Rights Reserved Page 3\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Alleged APT Intrusion Set: 1.php Group\n\n###### Contents\n\nSummary....................................................................................................................... 1\n\nIntroduction.................................................................................................................... 1\n\nSection 1: “1.php” Group Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT).......................................... 5\n\nSection 2: Customer Infection Behavior......................................................................... 8\n\n2.1 GET Beacons with Modified XOR Parameters......................................................... 8\n\n2.2 GET Beacons with Data moved to URL path............................................................ 9\n\n2.3 HTTPS CONNECTs to C&Cs.................................................................................... 9\n\nSection 3: Indent Inter-Relationships............................................................................. 10\n\n3.1 Possible Relationship to Other APT Incidents.......................................................... 12\n\nSection 4: Lessons Learned........................................................................................... 13\n\n4.1 Conduct logging and analytics within your environment.......................................... 13\n\n4.2 Correlate with other sources................................................................................... 14\n\n4.3 APTs are not always that ‘Advanced........................................................................ 14\n\n4.4 APTs are not limited to the United States Government or Defense Industrial Base.... 14\n\n4.5 APT Information Disclosure Remains a Challenge................................................... 15\n\nConclusion..................................................................................................................... 16\n\n© 2011 Zscaler All Rights Reserved Page 4\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Alleged APT Intrusion Set: 1.php Group\n\n###### Section 1:\n\n\n###### “1.php” Group Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)\n\nThere is a good deal of information in the public domain related to\n\n\n“1.php” Group incidents (malware and C&Cs) that can be correlated with\n\nincident activity that we identify and detail within this report. Intrusion\n\nactivities related to this Group date back at least to 2009, if not earlier\n\n\n(there is one sample we found dating back to 2008). For example, a\n\nDecember 7, 2009 blog post by Contagio[2 ] details a malicious phishing\n\n\nemail regarding United States troop deployment in Afghanistan that\n\nprovides a malicious link to:\n\n\n#####    Once unzipped,\n\n# “the malware is a\n\n##### Windows executable with an SCR extension that is identified as a Poison Ivy RAT variant.\n\n -Zscaler ThreatLabZ\n\n\nFile name: WWW.DREAMLIFES.NET/Afghanistan/Afghanistan.zip.\n\nMD5: 052E62513505A25CCFADF900A052709C\n\n\nOnce unzipped, the malware is a Windows executable with an SCR\n\nextension that is identified as a Poison Ivy RAT variant. Beyond simple\n\n\nphishing attacks with links to malware, the Group also sends spear\nphishing emails with malicious PDF attachments to their targets. For\n\n\nexample, the SANS ISC Handler’s Diary drew attention to this Group’s\n\nphishing campaign exploiting CVE-2009-4324 in January 2010. A\n\n\nscreenshot of their story headline is below in: Figure 1 SANS ISC Diary\n\nHeadline related to “1.php” malware campaign[3].\n\n\nFigure 1 SANS ISC Diary Headline related to “1.php” malware campaign\n\nAn example of one of the Poison Ivy RAT payloads used during this\n\n\ncampaign was:\n\nFile name: SUCHOST.EXE dropped from Request.pdf email attachment\n\n\nMD5: B0EECA383A7477EE689EC807B775EBBB\n\n**2. http://contagiodump.blogspot.com/2009/12/attack-of-day-poison-ivy-zip-download.html**\n**3. http://isc.sans.edu/diary.html?storyid=7867**\n\n\n© 2011 Zscaler All Rights Reserved Page 5\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Alleged APT Intrusion Set: 1.php Group\n\nThis file received commands from: CECON.FLOWER-SHOW.ORG.\n\nMore recently, in July 2011, open-source reports[4] exist of Poison Ivy\n\nusage surrounding the FLOWER-SHOW.ORG domain. This incident\n\nexploited PDF vulnerabilities (CVE-2010-2883) in attached spear-phishing\n\nemails targeting experts on Japan, China, Taiwan / USA relationships.\n\nSee a screenshot of the email in: Figure 2 Spear-phishing email with\n\nattachment exploiting CVE-2010-2883.\n\nFigure 2 Spear-phishing email with attachment exploiting CVE-2010-2883\n\nOnce the Poison Ivy payload is installed, it frequently uses a unique\n\nbeaconing pattern to communicate with a C&C server. To illustrate the\n\ncommunication sequence, reference the Joebox sandbox report[5] for the\n\nfollowing file:\n\nFile name: Halloween.scr\n\nMD5: 5B90896127179F0AD2E6628593CDB60D\n\n**4. http://contagiodump.blogspot.com/2011/07/jul-13-cve-2010-2883-pdf-meeting-agenda.html**\n\n© 2011 Zscaler All Rights Reserved Page 6\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Alleged APT Intrusion Set: 1.php Group\n\nThis report shows that once infected, the victim:\n\n\n\n- Communicates with C&Cs:\n\n– FREE.COFFEELAUCH.COM (98.126.69.3)\n\n\n– FIREHAPPY.SYTES.NET * (98.126.69.3)\n\n\n\n- Via HTTP GET requests to the path: /1.php?id=[data1]&id=[data2]\n\n&id=[data3]&id=[data4]&id=&id=\n\n\n– 2.php, 3.php, and 4.php with id parameters and some with an\n\nending &Done have also been observed\n\n\n– The data parameters are information about the infected host (IP,\n\nhostname, MAC address, username, and OS/system version) that\n\n\n#####    The “1.php?=”\n\n# “ HTTP GET request for\n\n##### the initial C&C check- in has been identified in the majority of past incidents involving this Group and is the reason for the informal “1.php” name used to describe this intrusion set.\n\n -Zscaler ThreatLabZ\n\n\nhave been base64 encoded and then XORed. XOR keys of 0x3C\n\n\nand 0x3E have been observed.\n\nAn asterisk following a domain will designate No-IP[6] dynamic DNS\n\ndomains in this report. Dynamic DNS is a service that provides free,\n\n\ncheap flexible domain hostname to IP address resolution and No-IP is\n\none of the many vendors in this space.\n\n\nWhile the malware variants used are generally referred to as Poison\n\nIvy variants, there are many cases of them being detected/labeled as a\n\ngeneric Trojan, Backdoor, or something else entirely. For example, in a\n\n\nDecember 2009 malware report Kaspersky lists one variant as Trojan.\n\nWin32.Buzus.cvdu[7] and in June 2010 another as Trojan.Win32.Agent.\n\neevf[8] .\n\n\nNote the “1.php?id=” HTTP GET request for the initial C&C check-in.\n\nThis specific behavior has been identified in the vast majority of past\n\nincidents involving this Group and is reason for the informal “1.php”\n\n\nname used to describe these intrusion sets within the report. More\n\ninformation may be garnered from the open-source community, but the\n\n\nabove should be a sufficient introduction into the tactics, techniques, and\n\nprocedures (TTPs) of this Group.\n\n\n**5. http://support.clean-mx.de/clean-mx/view_joebox.php?md5=9339bb2af4d8c07e63051d0f120530e1&id=679603**\n**6. http://www.no-ip.com/services/managed_dns/free_dynamic_dns.html**\n**7. http://www.securelist.com/en/descriptions/7383071/Trojan.Win32.Buzus.cvdu**\n**8. http://www.securelist.com/en/descriptions/7854148/Trojan.Win32.Agent.eevf**\n\n© 2011 Zscaler All Rights Reserved Page 7\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Alleged APT Intrusion Set: 1.php Group\n\n###### Section 2: Customer Infection Behavior\n\n\nZscaler has observed on-going attacks from June 2010 to present,\n\ninvolving a Cleared Defense Contractor. Given the entity involved and the\n\n\ncharacteristics of the traffic observed, Zscaler believes that the attack is\n\ndirectly related to the “1.php” Group. While these attacks appear related\n\nto the “1.php” Group, the beacons do not bear the previously mentioned\n\n\n“1.php” HTTP path. However, there are many similarities regarding\n\nthese “new” beacons as well as direct relationships regarding previously\n\n\n#####    Zscaler believes that\n# “ongoing attacks against\n##### a sensitive customer are directly related to the “1.php” Group.\n\n -Zscaler ThreatLabZ\n\n\nidentified domains and IPs used by the “1.php” group. Presumably,\n\nthese “new” beacon behaviors have been altered to evade any\n\n\nsignatures designed to detect the previous “1.php” beaconing behavior.\n\n###### 2.1 GET Beacons with Modified XOR Parameters\n\n\nOne of the first variations that we noticed in the attacks, was that the\n\ninfected hosts sent HTTP GET request check-ins to URLs with the\n\n\ngeneral pattern of:\n\nFQDN/css.ashx?sc=[data1]&sp=[data2]&ad=[data3]&dh=[data4]&mr=[d\n\n\nata5]&tk=\n\nThe data parameters contained the same victim information as\n\n\nmentioned in the “1.php” beacons and were also base64 encoded\n\nand XORed with a key. Examples of C&Cs that we observed for this\n\n\nparticular check-in variant include:\n\n- HOUSE.SUPERDOGDREAM.COM\n\n- HOME.ALLMYDEARFRIENDS.COM\n\n- GOOGLETIME.SERVEIRC.COM *\n\n- INFO.SPORTGAMEINFO.COM\n\n- PEOPLE.ENJOYHOLIDAYS.NET\n\n- PEARHOST.SERVEHALFLIFE.COM *\n(June 2010 – 1st C&C observed in infection)\n\n\n© 2011 Zscaler All Rights Reserved Page 8\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Alleged APT Intrusion Set: 1.php Group\n\n###### 2.2 GET Beacons with Data moved to URL path\n\n\nThe next variation that we noticed in attacks, involved the infected hosts\n\nsending HTTP GET request check-ins to URLs with the general pattern of:\n\nFQDN/[data1]/[data2]/[data3]/[data4]/[data5]\n\n\nThe data did not appear to be XORed in the same manner as the beacons\n\nthat were previously identified. However, based on size and number of\n\n\n#####  …it is currently\n\n# “believed that the\n\n##### infection point was through malicious email attachments (as was the case in many of the “1.php” OSINT incidents).\n\n -Zscaler ThreatLabZ\n\n\ndata blocks, it appears that the beacons contain similar information from\n\nthe victims. Examples of C&Cs used in this infection variant include:\n\n\n\n- SATELLITE.QUICKSEARCHMOVIE.COM\n\n- WWW.TOYHOPING.COM\n\n- WORK.FREETHROWLINE.NET\n\n- SEA.ANIMALFANS.NET\n\n- WWW.SEARCHSEA.NET\n\n- LOVE.ANIMALFANS.NET\n\n- WWW.JOBCALL.ORG\n\n###### 2.3 HTTPS CONNECTs to C&Cs\n\n\nThe latest variations on these attacks are related to customer infections\n\nbeginning on August 3, 2011. Prior to infection for this incident, as well\n\nas the previous ones listed, web transaction logs did not provide any\n\n\nstrong evidence of the infection point – it is currently believed that the\n\ninfection point was through malicious email attachments (as was the\n\n\ncase in many of the “1.php” OSINT incidents). Following infection, many\n\nweb transactions were witnessed each hour to the C&C servers via\n\n\nHTTPS with the following behaviors:\n\n- CONNECT on port 443/TCP with 200 HTTP response code\n\n- HTTP request version 1.0 with HTTP response version 1.1\n\n- Request size for “keep-alive” beacons were primarily 227 – 228 bytes\n\n- Response size is most commonly between 969 – 990 bytes\n\n- Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 user-agent string (hard-coded into\nmalware, as this is not a standard browser for this customer)\n\n\n© 2011 Zscaler All Rights Reserved Page 9\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Alleged APT Intrusion Set: 1.php Group\n\nExamples of C&Cs used in this infection variant include:\n\n- WWW.SAVAGECOUNTY.NET\n\n- LOOK.CAPTAINSABERTOOTH.NET\n\n- GEOINFO.SERVEHTTP.COM *\n\n- ROSE.OFFICESKYLINE.COM\n\n- WWW.CAREERCHALLENGES.NET\n\n- OFFER.AMERICAMS.N\n\n###### Section 3: Incident Inter-Relationships\n\nThere are a number of domains and IP addresses that have been tied to\n\nthe previously mentioned incidents. Toward the beginning of the report\n\nit was stated that we believed all of these incidents to be related. As\n\nhas already been seen, there are some similarities across the incidents,\n\nsuch as same victim organization, similar beaconing data blocks, and\n\ninfection believed to be from malicious email attachments. However, the\n\nstrongest evidence for their relationship is the fact that related domains\n\nand IPs are used for C&Cs across these incidents.\n\n© 2011 Zscaler All Rights Reserved Page 10\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Alleged APT Intrusion Set: 1.php Group\n\nThe following Figure 3 - Link-Graph of “1.php” Incident Inter-Relationship\n\nprovides this illustration with only a small snippet of information from\n\nthese incidents:\n\n\nDOMAIN\n\n\nHOSTNAME IP RESOLUTION\n\n\nZhang, Yao hua” Registration details\nICP100.net nmaeservers\n\n\ndreamlifes.net\n\n\njobcall.org\n\n\nofficeskyline.com\n\n\n178.63.130.197\n\n\n46.4.209.130\n\n\ncoffeelaunch.com\n\n\nsportgameinfo.com\n\n\ncaptainsabertooth.net\n\n\nOSINT “1.php” Incidents\n\n\nExample of Possible\nVictim Names\n\n\nwww\n\n\nfree\n\n\nimage\n\n\nqnao\n\n\ndo:\n\n\nsmart\n\n\n© 2011 Zscaler All Rights Reserved Page 11\n\n\nseablow.net\n\n\ngeoinfo.servehttp.com\n\n\nsuperdogdream.com\n\n\nenjoyholidays.net\n\n\n2.2 Incidents\n\n\n2.3 Incidents\n\n\ntastfine\n\n\nhouse\n\n\nrose\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Alleged APT Intrusion Set: 1.php Group\n\n###### 3.1 Possible Relationship to Other APT Incidents\n\n\nPast experience with APT-style incidents show that hostnames may be\n\nused to identify the C&C for particular victims of interest. For example,\n\n\nin bakerhughes.thruthere.net[9] was a C&C used against Baker Hughes\n\nin the disclosed Night Dragon[10] attacks. There have been a number\n\nof interesting hostnames used with “1.php” C&C domains that may\n\n\nindicate other potential victims. These hostnames potentially identify\n\nvictims within the US Government (USG), Defense Industrial Base (DIB),\n\n\n#####  There have been a\n\n# “number of interesting\n\n##### hostnames used with “1.php” C&C domains that may include other potential victims.\n\n -Zscaler ThreatLabZ\n\n\nand Geospatial industry. The above link-graph provides one example of\n\nsuch an entity that has information about its attacks already disclosed in\n\nthe open-source (QinetiQ).\n\n\n“QINETIQ” or “QNAO” (QinetiQ North America Operations) for example,\n\nwas an HBGary customer. HBGary supported QinetiQ in detection\n\n\nand analysis of on-going targeted attacks against them. Following the\n\nAnonymous compromise and leakage of HBGary information, there is\n\nsignificant information in the public domain regarding the attacks against\n\n\nQinetiQ. One such example is HBGary’s Incident Response Technical\n\nReport Supplement for QinetiQ[11] . Page 8 of that report, in the “History\n\n\nof the strain” section states:\n\nHBGary has code-named this threat group as “Soysauce”. This group\n\nis also known as “Comment Crew” by some, and also as “GIF89a” by\n\nsome. The choice of codename is completely arbitrary in this context\n\nand is simply meant to identify a group of Chinese hackers who have\n\n\na consistent agenda to target the defense industrial complex.\n\nThe name “Comment Crew” and “GIF89a” has been used by\n\n\nresearchers because of the behavior of this group to enclose C&C\n\ncommands within comments on HTML pages or hidden within image\n\nfiles, a technique known as steganography. These indicators have not\n\n\nbeen witnessed in the attacks previously listed in this report.\n\nBeyond a likely QinetiQ attack relation, there are a number of other\n\n\nhostnames that indicate potential attack targets of the “1.php” Group.\n\nDisclosure of other possible victim names is intentionally omitted from\n\nthis report.\n\n\n**9. http://hbgary.anonleaks.ch/greg_hbgary_com/2505.html**\n**10. http://www.mcafee.com/in/resources/white-papers/wp-global-energy-cyberattacks-night-dragon.pdf**\n**11. http://publicintelligence.info/HBGary-QinetiQ.pdf**\n\n© 2011 Zscaler All Rights Reserved Page 12\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Alleged APT Intrusion Set: 1.php Group\n\n###### Section 4: Lessons Learned\n\nA number of lessons can be learned from analyzing incidents within\n\nthis intrusion set. In the following section, we will discuss analytical\n\ntechniques that enterprises should be adopting, in order to uncover\n\nsimilar attacks on their organizations.\n\n###### 4.1 Conduct logging and analytics within your environment\n\nThis report shows an evolution of the beaconing behavior from the\n\n“1.php” Group. Relying solely on existing signatures of known threats\n\nwould not have triggered detections. By identifying transactions that\n\nare anomalous, it is possible to detect previous or recurring incidents,\n\nsuch as those identified above. Some of the anomalies, which led to the\n\nfindings in this report, include:\n\n- HTTP version 1.0 requests with version 1.1 responses\n\n- Numerous transactions to an unknown / uncategorized domain\n\n– Some of these transactions were to No-IP dynamic DNS domains\n\n    - Blocking or heavily monitoring the communication to dynamic\n\nDNS domains is recommended\n\n– Some of these domains were parked\n\n– Transactions occur during non-standard times (nights / weekends)\n\n– Some transactions (in particular the GET beacons) had a larger\n\nrequest size than response size\n\n- Microsoft IE 6 user-agent (UA) string usage in an environment that\n\ndoes not typically use this UA\n\n© 2011 Zscaler All Rights Reserved Page 13\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Alleged APT Intrusion Set: 1.php Group\n\n###### 4.2 Correlate with other sources\n\n\nBy leveraging data sources such as passive DNS, domain registration\n\ninformation, other open-source reports, and other research - it is possible\n\n\nto derive information about probable domains and infrastructure used,\n\nin other attacks by the same group of attackers. In some cases, this\n\n\ninformation may provide indicators as to the targets or purpose of the\n\nattacks. It should also be noted that making too many assumptions or\n\nbelieving unverified indicators as fact can lead to misleading information.\n\n\n##### While the exploitation\n\n# “used in some of\n\n##### the crafted PDF attachments may be considered advanced, for the most part the attack is one of social-engineering.\n\n -Zscaler ThreatLabZ\n\n\nAnyone can set a hostname for a C&C to be “QINETIQ” for example.\n\nHowever, by correlating these domains with a group that has been\n\n\nidentified as being involved in APT attacks, provides a stronger indication\n\ninto their possible target.\n\n\n###### 4.3 APTs are not always that ‘Advanced’\n\nThe above incident reports document (spear-) phishing with a malicious\n\n\nPDF attachment, or link to a binary executable with a Poison Ivy RAT\n\npayload. While the exploitation used in some of the crafted PDF\n\n\nattachments may be considered advanced, for the most part the attack is\n\none of social-engineering. This is nothing new and something that other\n\nfraudsters / criminals have been leveraging for many years. RSA recently\n\n\nwrapped up their APT summit and their first finding concluded that the\n\n“attack vector [is] shifting from technology to people”.[12]\n\n\n###### 4.4 APTs are not limited to the United States Government       or Defense Industrial Base\n\nThe victim related to this report is neither a Government agency, nor\n\n\nan entity that would normally be associated with the Defense Industrial\n\nBase. While this report does list USG (United State Government) and\n\n\nDIB (Defense Industrial Base) entities as possible victims, there are many\n\nmore commercial entities within the Geospatial and Telecommunication\n\n\nindustries that appear to have been victims of this Group. Zscaler has\n\nnoted both foreign and domestic entities that have been victims of other\n\n\nAPT incidents as well.\n\n**12. http://www.rsa.com/summitresults**\n\n\n© 2011 Zscaler All Rights Reserved Page 14\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Alleged APT Intrusion Set: 1.php Group\n\n###### 4.5 APT Information Disclosure Remains a Challenge\n\nIncident Information Disclosure is an extension to the heated debate\n\naround vulnerability information disclosure, and full-disclosure versus\n\nresponsible-disclosure. Responsible-disclosure is fairly well defined and\n\nadopted within the vulnerability space, but it is not within the incident\n\nspace.\n\n**Here are some arguments for “full disclosure” of incident information:**\n\n- A larger community of awareness (and thus potential detection\n\npossibility), particularly if there are more organizations impacted\n\n- A general philosophy that information should be public and that the\n\nGovernment or information security community should not have\n\nsecrets kept from the public\n\n- The public should be made aware of which organizations have been\n\nvictimized so that this information and their response can be weighed\n\nbefore trusting them again in the future\n\n**Here are some arguments for “responsible disclosure” (the**\n\n**selective release of information to specific parties) of incident information**\n\n- Public release will cause the attacker to alter their TTPs and possibly\n\nallow them to make changes to infected systems prior to incident\n\nresponse action, making detection more difficult\n\n- Public release of information can be viewed as attempting to garner\n\nthe spotlight for financial motives versus genuine concerns about\n\nsecurity\n\n- There may be law enforcement (or other) investigations that are\n\non-going and such a release of information could compromise the\n\ninvestigation\n\n**Zscaler adheres to the following general principals for incident/**\n\n**vulnerability disclosure:**\n\n- Customer specific information is disclosed only to the impacted\n\ncustomer\n\n© 2011 Zscaler All Rights Reserved Page 15\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Alleged APT Intrusion Set: 1.php Group\n\n- Customer information will be redacted prior to public disclosure\n\nor disclosure to other impacted parties, stake-holders, and trusted\n\ngroups within the information security community\n\n- Public disclosure will provide high-level indicators of compromise\n\n(such as general network behavior and malicious domains) without\n\nthe release of specifics as to which organizations were impacted and\n\nis done so when it is believed that such information will benefit others\n\nin protecting against similar threats\n\n- Based on feedback/approval from the impacted parties, stake-holders,\n\nand information security community – additional information may be\n\nreleased to the public\n\nZscaler is willing to share additional details of the incidents discussed\n\nin this report with trusted groups within the information security\n\ncommunity to help further their research with regard to similar incidents.\n\nIf you are interested in sharing data on this and other incidents, we\n\nencourage you to contact us at threatlabz@zscaler.com.\n\n###### Conclusion\n\nBy interrogating Zscaler’s comprehensive logging repository for\n\nanomalous activity and indicators of compromise, a Zscaler ThreatLabZ\n\nresearcher identified a high-risk entity victimized by a possible APT attack\n\nlinked to the “1.php” Group. The conclusion that these attacks should be\n\nclassified as an APT attack are based on the following indicators:\n\n- The victim enterprise is a high risk target, involved in an industry that\n\nhas regularly been targeted in similar attacks\n\n- Linkages were identified among several previous incidents from 2010\n\nto present, showing persistence\n\n- There remains little to no open-source information on the domains /\n\nIPs used in the attack, and the linkage to open-source reports shows a\n\ncorrelation with past APT incidents\n\n© 2011 Zscaler All Rights Reserved Page 16\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Alleged APT Intrusion Set: 1.php Group\n\n- The RAT payload in question is popular among previously documented\n\n\nAPT incidents\n\n\n\n- Some No-IP dynamic DNS domains used (while a weak APT indicator,\n\ndynamic DNS domains have often been used among documented APT\n\n\n##### The sum of these\n\n# “indicators has led to\n\n##### our conclusion that this was an attack performed over a significant period of time that focused on a specific target, given the sensitive nature of their work.\n\n -Zscaler ThreatLabZ\n\n\nincidents, such as Aurora and Night Dragon)\n\n\n\n- Hostnames related to victims are used, which is a technique\n\npreviously documented in other APT attacks\n\n\n\n- Nameserver and domain registration information indicates likely\n\nChinese origin of attacks\n\n\n\n- VPS/hosting servers used match some of those previously used in\n\nalleged APT attacks.\n\n\nThe sum of these indicators has led to our conclusion that this was\n\nan attack performed over a significant period of time that focused on\n\n\na specific target, given the sensitive nature of their work. Based on\n\ninformation in the public domain, it appears that these attacks correlate\n\n\nwith others, previously identified as being the work of the “1.php”\n\nGroup. Identified targets of these attacks include China/US relations\n\n\nexperts, USG / DIB entities, and the Geospatial industry. Based on\n\nthe targets, it is our belief that corporate espionage was the goal of\n\n\nthe attacks. Open-source reports suggest that these attacks are more\n\nwidespread than many realize and that the same or similar actors\n\n\nare compromising numerous organizations in order to steal sensitive\n\nintellectual property. As stated within the Lessons Learned section, it\n\n\nis important that those concerned about such attacks be vigilant in their\n\nlog collection and analysis to identify anomalies or other indications of\n\n\ncompromise.\n\n© 2011 Zscaler All Rights Reserved Page 17\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Alleged APT Intrusion Set: 1.php Group\n\n###### About Zscaler: The Cloud Security Company™\n\nZscaler enforces business policy, mitigates risk and provides twice\n\nthe functionality at a fraction of the cost of current solutions, utilizing\n\na multi-tenant, globally-deployed infrastructure.
