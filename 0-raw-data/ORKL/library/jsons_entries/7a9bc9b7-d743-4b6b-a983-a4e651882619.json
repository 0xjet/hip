Their targets have spanned all across the world, with a\nfocus on government, defense organizations and various Eastern European governments.\n[There have been numerous reports on their activities, to the extent that a Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofacy_Group)\nhas even been created for them.\n\nFrom these reports, we know that the group uses an abundance of tools and tactics, ranging\nacross zero-day exploits targeting common applications such as Java or Microsoft Office,\nheavy use of spear-phishing attacks, compromising legitimate websites to stage wateringhole attacks, and targeting over a variety of operating systems – Windows, OSX, Linux, even\nmobile iOS.\n\nThe Linux malware Fysbis is a preferred tool of Sofacy, and though it is not particularly\nsophisticated, Linux security in general is still a maturing area, especially in regards to\nmalware. In short, it is entirely plausible that this tool has contributed to the success of\nassociated attacks by this group. This blog post focuses specifically on this Linux tool\npreferred by Sofacy and describes considerations and implications when it comes to Linux\nmalware.\n\n## Malware Assessment\n\nFysbis is a modular Linux trojan / backdoor that implements plug-in and controller modules\nas distinct classes. For reference, some vendors categorize this malware under the Sednit\nattacker group naming designation. This malware includes both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of\n[Executable and Linking Format (ELF) binaries. Additionally, Fysbis can install itself to a](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1059)\nvictim system with or without root privileges. This increases the options available to an\nadversary when it comes to selecting accounts for installation.\n\n\n-----\n\nSummary information for the three binaries we analyzed follows:\n\nMD5 364ff454dcf00420cff13a57bcb78467\n\nSHA-256 8bca0031f3b691421cb15f9c6e71ce19335\n5d2d8cf2b190438b6962761d0c6bb\n\nssdeep 3072:n+1R4tREtGN4qyGCXdHPYK9l0H786\nO26BmMAwyWMn/qwwiHNl:n+1R43QcIL\nXdF0w6IBmMAwwCwwi\n\nSize 141.2 KB (144560 bytes)\n\nType ELF 64-bit (stripped)\n\nInstall as root /bin/rsyncd\n\nRoot install desc synchronize and backup service\n\nInstall as non-root ~/.config/dbus-notifier/dbus-inotifier\n\nNon-root install desc system service d-bus notifier\n\nC2 azureon-line[.]com (TCP/80)\n\nUsage Timeframe Late 2014\n\nTable 1: Sample 1 - Late 2014 Sofacy 64-bit Fysbis\n\nMD5 075b6695ab63f36af65f7ffd45cccd39\n\nSHA-256 02c7cf55fd5c5809ce2dce56085ba43795f2\n480423a4256537bfdfda0df85592\n\nssdeep 3072:9ZAxHANuat3WWFY9nqjwbuZf454U\nNqRpROIDLHaSeWb3LGmPTrIW33HxIajF:\n9ZAxHANJAvbuZf454UN+rv eQLZPTrV3Z\n\nSize 175.9 KB (180148 bytes)\n\nType ELF 32-bit (stripped)\n\nInstall as root /bin/ksysdefd\n\nRoot install desc system kernel service defender\n\nInstall as non-root ~/.config/ksysdef/ksysdefd\n\nNon-root install desc system kernel service defender\n\nC2 198.105.125[.]74 (TCP/80)\n\n\n-----\n\nUsage Timeframe Early 2015\n\nTable 2: Sample 2 - Early 2015 Sofacy 32-bit Fysbis\n\nMD5 e107c5c84ded6cd9391aede7f04d64c8\n\nSHA-256 fd8b2ea9a2e8a67e4cb3904b49c789d57ed\n9b1ce5bebfe54fe3d98214d6a0f61\n\nssdeep 6144:W/D5tpLWtr91gmaVy+mdckn6BCUd\nc4mLc2B9:4D5Lqgkcj+\n\nSize 314.4 KB (321902 bytes)\n\nType ELF 64-bit (not stripped)\n\nInstall as root /bin/ksysdefd\n\nRoot install desc system kernel service defender\n\nInstall as non-root ~/.config/ksysdef/ksysdefd\n\nNon-root install desc system kernel service defender\n\nC2 mozilla-plugins[.]com (TCP/80)\n\nUsage Timeframe Late 2015\n\nTable 3: Sample 3 - Late 2015 Sofacy 64-bit Fysbis\n\nOverall, these binaries are assessed as low sophistication, but effective. They epitomize the\ngrudging reality that Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors often don’t require advanced\nmeans to affect their objectives. Rather, these actors more often than not hold their\nadvanced malware and zero day exploits in reserve and employ just enough resources to\nmeet their goals. It is only fair that defenders use any shortcuts or tricks at their disposal to\nshorten the amount of time it takes to assess threats. In other words, defenders should\nalways look for ways to work smarter before they have to work harder.\n\n**Getting the Most Out of Strings**\n\nBinary strings alone revealed a good amount about these files, increasing the efficacy of\n[activities such as static analysis categorization (e.g., Yara). One example of this is Fysbis](https://plusvic.github.io/yara/)\ninstallation and platform targeting information for the samples in Table 1 and Table 2.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Sofacy Fysbis installation and platform targeting found in strings\n\nIn this case, we can see the binary installation path and local reconnaissance to determine\nwhich flavor of Linux the malware is running. This is followed by a number of Linux shell\ncommand style commands related to the malware establishing persistence.\n\nAnother example of easily obtained information from these samples is capability based.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Sofacy Fysbis capability related leakage through strings\n\nFigure 2 shows interactive status / feedback strings that can give a defender an initial profile\nof capabilities. In addition to contributing to static analysis detections, this can be useful as a\nstarting point for further incident response prioritization and qualification of the threat.\n\n**Symbolic Information Can Shorten Analysis Time**\n\nInterestingly, the most recent ELF 64-bit binary we analyzed (Table 3) was not stripped prior\nto delivery, which offered additional context in the form of symbolic information. Defenders\n[more familiar with Windows Portable Executable (PE) binaries can equate this with](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms809762.aspx)\ncompilation of a Debug version versus a Release version. For comparison, if we were to\ninspect Fysbis “RemoteShell” associated strings in one of the stripped variants, we would\nonly see the following:\n\nFigure 3: Sofacy Fysbis stripped binary string references to RemoteShell capability\n\nCompare this with what is available from the non-stripped variant:\n\nFigure 4: Sofacy Fysbis non-stripped binary strings referenes to RemoteShell capability\n\nLittle static analysis gifts like these can help to speed defender enumeration of capabilities\nand – more importantly – further contribute to correlation and detection across related\nsamples.\n\nAdditionally, this latest sample demonstrated minor evolution of the threat, most notably in\nterms of obfuscation. Specifically, both samples in Table 1 and Table 2 leaked installation\ninformation in the clear within binary strings. This was not the case with the sample in Table\n3. Taking a closer look at this non-stripped binary using a disassembler, the following\ncorresponds to decoding malware installation information for a root-privilege account.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Assembly code view of Sample 3 installation decoding\n\nIn this case, the symbolic information hints at the method used for decoding, with references\nto mask, path, name, and info byte arrays.\n\nFigure 6: Assembly view of Sample 3 root installation related byte arrays\n\nAs it turns out, the referenced byte mask is applied to the other byte arrays using a rolling\ndouble-XOR algorithm to construct malware installation paths, filenames, and descriptions\nfor a Linux root account. Corresponding INSTALLUSER byte arrays exist, which facilitate the\nnon-root installation for the trojan. The same masking method is also used by the binary to\ndecode malware configuration C2 information, further showcasing how a little symbolic\ninformation can go a long way towards completeness and higher confidence in assessment\nof a malware sample.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about how Fysbis works, the samples analyzed remain fairly\n[consistent with the sample analysis found here.](http://vms.drweb.com/virus/?i=4276269)\n\n## Infrastructure Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nAs Unit 42 has discussed in depth in other blog articles, we have observed that adversaries\nin general are seemingly hesitant in changing their infrastructure. This may be due to not\nwanting to commit additional resources, or simply a matter of retaining familiarity for the sake\nof timeliness. In either case, we see the same type of behavior here with the Fysbis samples\nin use by Sofacy.\n\nThe oldest sample (Table 1), was found to beacon to the domain azureon-line[.]com, which\nhad already been widely publicized as a known command and control domain for the Sofacy\ngroup. Using passive DNS, we can see that two of the original IPs this domain resolved to,\n193.169.244[.]190 and 111.90.148[.]148 also mapped to a number of other domains that had\nbeen in use by the Sofacy group during that time period.\n\nFigure 7: Sample 1 C2 resolutions\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first of the newer samples (Table 2), continues the trend and beacons to an IP also\nwidely associated with the Sofacy group, 198.105.125[.]74. This IP has been mostly\n[associated with the tool specifically known as CHOPSTICK, which can be read about here.](https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/fireye/images/rpt-apt28.pdf)\n\nFigure 8: Sample 2 C2 resolutions\n\nThe newest sample (Table 3), introduces a previously unknown command and control\nbeacon to mozilla-plugins[.]com. This activity aligns with the previously observed Sofacy\ngroup tactic of integrating legitimate company references into their infrastructure naming\nconvention. Neither this new domain nor the IP it resolves to have been observed in the past,\nindicating that the sample in Table 3 may be associated with a newer campaign. Comparing\nthis sample’s binary with the other two however, shows there are significant similarities on\nthe code level as well as in terms of shared behavior.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: Sample 3 C2 resolutions\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLinux is used across business and home environments and appears in a variety of form\nfactors. It is a preferred platform within data centers and the cloud for businesses, as well as\nan ongoing favorite when it comes to a majority of Internet-facing web and application\nservers. Linux is also at the foundation of Android devices and a number of other embedded\nsystems. The value proposition of Linux – especially when it comes to its use in the\nenterprise – can be broken out into three perceived benefits: lower total cost of ownership\n(TCO), security, and feature set. While numbers and comparison alone can contribute to\nmeasurement of TCO and feature set, security requires further qualification. Expertise in the\nLinux platform is highly sought after across all industries for multiple disciplines, from system\nadministration to big data analytics to incident response.\n\nThe majority of businesses still maintain Windows-heavy user environments where certain\ncore infrastructure components also operate under Windows servers (e.g., Active Directory,\nSharePoint, etc.). This means, from a practical perspective, most of a business’s focus\nremains on supporting and protecting Windows assets. Linux remains a mystery to a number\nof enterprise IT specialists –most critically for network defenders. Identifying and qualifying\npotential incidents requires a familiarity with what constitutes normal operation in order to\nisolate anomalies. The same is true for any other asset in an environment, normal operation\nis entirely dependent on a given asset’s role / function in the enterprise.\n\n\n-----\n\nLack of expertise and visibility into non-Windows platforms combine in some environments to\npresent significant risks against an organization’s security posture. As a recent caution, the\n[Linux vulnerability described under CVE-2016-0728 further demonstrates the potential](http://www.pcworld.com/article/3023870/security/linux-kernel-flaw-endangers-millions-of-pcs-servers-and-android-devices.html)\nbreadth of real-world risks to associated platforms. A natural extension of this exposure is\nincreased targeting by both dedicated and opportunistic attackers across various malicious\nactor motivations. Despite the lingering belief (and false sense of security) that Linux\ninherently yields higher degrees of protection from malicious actors, Linux malware and\nvulnerabilities do exist and are in use by advanced adversaries. To mitigate associated risks\nrequires tailored integration of the people, processes, and technology in support of\nprevention, monitoring, and detection within an environment.\n\nLinux malware detection and prevention is not prevalent at this time, but Palo Alto Networks\ncustomers are protected through our next-generation security platform:\n\nIPS signature 14917 deployed to identify and prevent command and control activity\nThe C2 domains and files mentioned in this report are blocked in our Threat Prevention\nproduct.\n\n## Indicators\n\n**Type** **Value**\n\nMD5 364ff454dcf00420cff13a57bcb78467\n\nSHA256 8bca0031f3b691421cb15f9c6e71ce193\n\n355d2d8cf2b190438b6962761d0c6bb\n\nssdeep 3072:n+1R4tREtGN4qyGCXdHPYK9l\n\n0H786O26BmMAwyWMn/qwwiHNl:n\n\n+1R43QcILXdF0w6IBmMAwwCwwi\n\nMD5 075b6695ab63f36af65f7ffd45cccd39\n\nSHA-256 02c7cf55fd5c5809ce2dce56085ba437\n95f2480423a4256537bfdfda0df85592\n\nssdeep 3072:9ZAxHANuat3WWFY9nqjwbuZf\n\n454UNqRpROIDLHaSeWb3LGmPTrI\n\nW33HxIajF:9ZAxHANJAvbuZf454UN\n\n+rv eQLZPTrV3Z\n\nMD5 e107c5c84ded6cd9391aede7f04d64c8\n\nSHA-256 fd8b2ea9a2e8a67e4cb3904b49c789d\n\n57ed9b1ce5bebfe54fe3d98214d6a0f61\n\nssdeep 6144:W/D5tpLWtr91gmaVy+mdckn6\n\nBCUdc4mLc2B9:4D5Lqgkcj+\n\n\n-----\n\nPath /bin/rsyncd\n\nPath Desc synchronize and backup service\n\nPath ~/.config/dbus-notifier/dbus-inotifier\n\nPath Desc system service d-bus notifier\n\nPath /bin/ksysdefd\n\nPath ~/.config/ksysdef/ksysdefd\n\nPath Desc system kernel service defender\n\nC2 azureon-line[.]com\n\nC2 198.105.125[.]74\n\nC2 mozilla-plugins[.]com\n\nC2 Mozillaplagins[.]com\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
