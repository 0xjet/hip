While some\ndevelopers realized that the job involved \"black hat\" activities, conversations indicated that\nsome developers might not have realized they were working for cybercriminals.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the court document does not name the ransomware operation that Witte is believed to\nhave helped develop, BleepingComputer has been told that she worked on the recently\n[released Diavol ransomware.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/diavol-ransomware-sample-shows-stronger-connection-to-trickbot-gang/)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Google exposes tactics of a Conti ransomware access broker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-exposes-tactics-of-a-conti-ransomware-access-broker/)\n\n[New ChromeLoader malware surge threatens browsers worldwide](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-chromeloader-malware-surge-threatens-browsers-worldwide/)\n\n[New ERMAC 2.0 Android malware steals accounts, wallets from 467 apps](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ermac-20-android-malware-steals-accounts-wallets-from-467-apps/)\n\n[Practice your development skills with lifetime access to DevDojo](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/offer/deals/practice-your-development-skills-with-lifetime-access-to-devdojo/)\n\n[Interpol arrests alleged leader of the SilverTerrier BEC gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/interpol-arrests-alleged-leader-of-the-silverterrier-bec-gang/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
