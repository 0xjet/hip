In this blog post we aim to bridge the knowledge gap on this group and provide a more thorough insight into its\nlatest activities and modus operandi. Here are some key insights that will be described in this publication:\n\nCycldek (also known as Goblin Panda and Conimes) has been active in the past two years, conducting targeted operations against\ngovernments in Southeast Asia.\nOur analysis shows two distinct patterns of activity, indicating the group consists of two operational entities that are active under a mutual\nquartermaster.\nWe were able to uncover an extensive toolset for lateral movement and information stealing used in targeted networks, consisting of\ncustom and unreported tools as well as living-off-the-land binaries.\nOne of the newly revealed tools is named USBCulprit and has been found to rely on USB media in order to exfiltrate victim data. This\nmay suggest Cycldek is trying to reach air-gapped networks in victim environments or relies on physical presence for the same purpose.\n\n## Background\n\nCycldek is a long-known Chinese-speaking threat actor. Based on the group’s past activity, it has a strong interest in Southeast Asian targets,\nwith a primary focus on large organizations and government institutions in Vietnam. This is evident from a series of targeted campaigns that\nare publicly attributed to the group, as outlined below:\n\n2013 – indicators affiliated to the group were found in a network of a technology company operating in several sectors, as briefly\n[described by CrowdStrike.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-august-goblin-panda/)\n2014 – further accounts by CrowdStrike describe vast activity by the group against Southeast Asian organizations, most notably Vietnam.\nThe campaigns made prominent use of Vietnamese-language lure documents, delivering commodity malware like PlugX, that was\ntypically leveraged by Chinese-speaking actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n0 t e g oup as t essed au c g attac s us g u e docu e ts t po t ca co te t e ated to et a, d opp g a a a t\nof a malicious program named NewCore RAT, as [described by Fortinet.](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/rehashed-rat-used-in-apt-campaign-against-vietnamese-organizations.html)\n2018 – attacks have been witnessed in government organizations across several Southeast Asian countries, namely Vietnam, Thailand\nand Laos, using a variety of tools and new TTPs. Those include usage of the Royal Road builder, developed versions of the NewCore\nRAT malware and other unreported implants. These were the focus of intel reports available to Kaspersky’s Threat Intelligence Portal\nsubscribers since October 2019, and will be the subject matter of this blog post.\n\n**_Figure 1: Timeline of Cycldek-attributed attacks._**\n\nMost attacks that we observed after 2018 start with a politically themed RTF document built with the 8.t document builder (also known as\n‘Royal Road’) and sent as a phishing mail to the victims. These documents are bundled with 1-day exploits (e.g. CVE-2012-0158, CVE-201711882, CVE-2018-0802) which in turn run a dropper for three files:\n\na legitimate signed application, usually related to an AV product, e.g. QcConsol – McAfee’s QuickClean utility, and wsc_proxy.exe,\nAvast’s remediation service.\na malicious DLL which is side-loaded by the former application.\nan encrypted binary which gets decrypted and executed by the DLL.\n\nThe final payload that is run in memory is malware known as NewCore RAT. It is based on an open-source framework named PcShare or\n[PcClient that used to be prevalent in Chinese hacker forums more than a decade ago. Today, the software is fully available on Github, allowing](https://github.com/xdnice/PCShare)\nattackers to leverage and modify it for their needs.\n\nIn the case of Cycldek, the first public accounts of the group’s usage of NewCore date back to 2017. As described in a blog post by Fortinet,\nthe malware provides the attacker with broad capabilities such as conducting a range of operations on files, taking screenshots, controlling the\nmachine via a remote shell and shutting down or restarting the system.\n\n## Two implants, two clusters\n\nWhen inspecting the NewCore RAT malware delivered during the various attacks we investigated, we were able to distinguish between two\nvariants. Both were deployed as side-loaded DLLs and shared multiple similarities, both in code and behavior. At the same time, we noticed\ndifferences that indicate the variants could have been used by different operators.\n\nOur analysis shows that the underlying pieces of malware and the way they were used form two clusters of activity. As a result, we named the\nvariants BlueCore and RedCore and examined the artifacts we found around each one in order to profile their related clusters. Notable\ncharacteristics of each cluster’s implant are summarized in the table below.\n\n**BlueCore** **RedCore**\n\n\nInitial Infection\nVector\n\nLegitimate AV\nUtility\n\nSide-Loaded\nDLL\n\n\nRTF documents Unknown\n\nQcConcol.exe (McAfee’s QuickClean utility) wsc_proxy.exe (Avast’s remediation\napplication)\n\nQcLite.dll wsc.dll\n\n\n-----\n\nPayload\nLoader\n\nInjected\nProcess\n\nConfiguration\nFile\n\n\nstdole.tlb – contains PE loading shellcode and an encrypted BlueCore\nbinary\n\n\ndllhst3g.exe explorer.exe or winlogon.exe\n\n%APPDATA%\\desktop.ini C:\\Documents and Settings\\All\nUsers\\Documents\\desktop.ini or\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\All\nUsers\\Documents\\desktopWOW64.ini\n\n\nmsgsm64.acm -contains PE loading shellcode\nand and an encrypted RedCore binary\n\n\nMutexes UUID naming scheme, e.g. {986AFDE7-F299-4A7D-BBF4CA756FC27208}, {CF94A87F-4B49-4751-8E5C-DA2D0A8DEC2F}\n\n\nUUID naming scheme, e.g. {CB191C19-1D2D45FC-9092-6DB462EFEAC6},\n{F0062B9A-15F8-4D5F-9DE802F39EBF71FB},\n\n{E68DFA68-1132-4A32-ADE28C87F282C457},\n\n{728264DE-3701-419B-84A42AD86B0C43A3},\n\n{2BCD5B61-288C-44D5-BA0DAAA00E9D2273},\n\n{D9AE3AB0-D123-4F38-A9BE898C8D49A214}\n\n\nCommunicated\nURL Scheme\n\n\nhttp://%s:%d/link?url=%s&enpl=%s&encd=%s http://%s:%d/search.jsp?\nreferer=%s&kw=%s&psid=%s\nor\n\nhttp://%s:%d/search.jsp?\nurl=%s&referer=%s&kw=%s&psid=%s\n\n\n**_Table 1: Comparison of BlueCore and RedCore loader and implant traits._**\n\nAs demonstrated by the table, the variants share similar behavior. For example, both use DLL load order hijacking to run code from DLLs\nimpersonating dependencies of legitimate AV utilities and both share a mutex naming convention of random UUIDs, where mutexes are used\nfor synchronization of thread execution. By comparing code in both implants, we can find multiple functions that originate from the PCShare\nRAT; however, several others (like the injection code in the figure below) are proprietary and demonstrate identical code that may have been\nwritten by a shared developer.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: Code similarity in proprietary injection code used in both RedCore and BlueCore implants. Code marked in yellow in_**\n**_BlueCore is an inlined version of the marked function in RedCore._**\n\nMoreover, both implants leverage similar injected shellcode used to load the RedCore and BlueCore implants. This shellcode, which resides in\nthe files ‘stdole.tlb’ and ‘msgsm64.acm’, contains a routine used to decrypt the implants’ raw executable from an embedded blob, map it to\nmemory and execute it from its entry point in a new thread. Since both pieces of shellcode are identical for the two variants and cannot be\nattributed to any open source project, we estimate that they originate from a proprietary shared resource.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 3: Call flow graph comparison for binary decryption functions used by the shellcode in both clusters._**\n\nHaving said that, it is also evident that there are differences between the variants. The clearest distinctions can be made by looking at malware\nfunctionality that is unique to one type of implant and absent from the other. The following are examples of features that could be found only in\nRedCore implants, suggesting that despite their similarity with BlueCore, they were likely used by a different entity for different purposes:\n\nKeylogger: RedCore records the title of the current foreground window (if it exists) and logs keystrokes each 10ms to an internal buffer of\nsize 65530. When this buffer is filled, data from it is written to a file named ‘RCoRes64.dat’. The data is encoded using a single byte XOR\nwith the key 0xFA.\nDevice enumerator: RedCore registers a window class intended to intercept window messages with a callback that checks if the\ninspected message was sent as a result of a DBT_DEVICEARRIVAL Such events signal the connection of a device to the system, in\nwhich case the callback verifies that this device is a new volume, and if it is, it sends a bitmap with the currently available logical drives to\nthe C&C.\nRDP logger: RedCore subscribes to an RDP connection event via ETW and notifies the C&C when it occurs. The code that handles this\n[functionality is based on a little-known Github repository named EventCop which is intended to obtain a list of users that connected to a](https://github.com/Mandar-Shinde/EventCop)\nsystem via RDP. The open-source code was modified so that instead of printing the data of the incoming connection, the malware would\ncontact the C&C and inform it about the connection event.\nProxy server: RedCore spawns a server thread that listens on a pre-configured port (by default 49563) and accepts requests from nonlocalhost connections. A firewall exception is made for the process before the server starts running, and any subsequent requests\npassed from a source to it will be validated and passed on to the C&C in their original format.\n\nPerhaps the most notable difference between the two implants is the URL scheme they use to connect and beacon their C&C servers. By\nlooking for requests made using similar URL patterns in our telemetry, we were able to find multiple C&C servers and divide the underlying\ninfrastructure based on the aforementioned two clusters. The requests by each malware type were issued only by legitimate and signed\napplications that were either leveraged to side-load a malicious DLL or injected with malicious code. All of the discovered domains were used\nto download further samples.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 4: Difference in URL scheme used by each implant for C2 communication._**\n\nThe conclusion that we were able to reach from this is that while all targets were diplomatic and government entities, each cluster of activity\nhad a different geographical focus. The operators behind the BlueCore cluster invested most of their efforts on Vietnamese targets with several\noutliers in Laos and Thailand, while the operators of the RedCore cluster started out with a focus on Vietnam and diverted to Laos by the end\nof 2018. The statistics of these activities, based on the number of detected samples we witnessed downloaded from each cluster of C&Cs, are\noutlined in the figures below.\n\n**_Figure 5: Volume of downloaded samples from C&Cs of each cluster by country and month, since mid-2018._**\n\nFurthermore, considering both differences and similarities, we are able to conclude that the activities we saw are affiliated to a single actor,\nwhich we refer to as Cycldek. In several instances, we spotted unique tools crafted by the group that were downloaded from servers of both\ngroups. One example of this, which can be seen in the figure below, is a tool custom built by the group named USBCulprit. Two samples of it\n\n\n-----\n\ne e do oaded o bot ueCo e a d edCo e se e s o e co p e e s e st ca be ou d t e ppe d a, t s suggests\nthe entities operating behind those clusters are sharing multiple resources – both code and infrastructure – and operating under a single\norganizational umbrella.\n\n**_Figure 6: Examples of proprietary malware named USBCulprit downloaded from servers of both clusters. Further examples are_**\n**_provided in the Appendix._**\n\n## Info stealing and lateral movement toolset\n\nDuring the analysis, we were able to observe a variety of tools downloaded from both BlueCore and RedCore implants used for either lateral\nmovement in the compromised networks or information stealing from infected nodes. There were several types of these tools – some were\nproprietary and formerly unseen in the wild; others were pieces of software copied from open-source post-exploitation frameworks, some of\nwhich were customized to complete specific tasks by the attackers.\n\nAs in the cases of RedCore and BlueCore, the downloaded tools were all invoked as side-loaded DLLs of legitimate signed applications. Such\napplications included AV components like wsc_proxy.exe (Avast remediation service), qcconsol.exe and mcvsshld.exe (McAfee components),\nas well as legitimate Microsoft and Google utilities like the resource compiler (rc.exe) and Google Updates (googleupdate.exe). These tools\ncould be used in order to bypass weak security mechanisms like application allowlisting, grant the malware additional permissions during\nexecution or complicate incident response.\n\nAs already mentioned, the bulk of these tools are common and widespread among attackers, sometimes referred to as living-off-the-land\nbinaries, or LOLbins. Such tools can be part of open-source and legitimate software, abused to conduct malicious activities. Examples include\nBrowserHistoryView (a Nirsoft utility to obtain browsing history from common browsers), ProcDump (Sysinternals tools used to dump memory,\npossibly to obtain passwords from running processes), Nbtscan (command line utility intended to scan IP networks for NetBIOS information)\nand PsExec (Sysinternals tools used to execute commands remotely in the network, typically used for lateral movement).\n\nThe rest of the tools were either developed fully by the attackers or made use of known tools that were customized to accommodate particular\nattack scenarios. The following are several notable examples:\n\n**Custom HDoor: an old tool providing full-featured backdoor capabilities like remote machine administration, information theft, lateral**\nmovement and the launch of DDoS attacks. Developed by a hacker known as Wicked Rose, it was popular in Chinese underground\n[forums for a while and made its way into the APT world in the form of variants based on it. One example is the Naikon APT that made](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07205555/TheNaikonAPT-MsnMM1.pdf)\nuse of the original tool.\n\nThe custom version used by Cycldek uses a small subset of the features and the attackers used it to scan internal networks and create\ntunnels between compromised hosts in order to avoid network detections and bypass proxies. The tool allows the attackers to exfiltrate\ndata from segregated hosts accessible through the local network but not connected to the internet.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 7: Command line usage of the custom HDoor tool._**\n\n**JsonCookies: proprietary tool that steals cookies from SQLite databases of Chromium-based browsers. For this purpose, the sqlite3.dll**\nlibrary is downloaded from the C&C and used during execution to parse the database and generate a JSON file named ‘FuckCookies.txt’\ncontaining stolen cookie info. Entries in the file resemble this one:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\n{\n\n\"domain\": \".google.com\",\n\n\"id\": 1,\n\n\"name\": \"NID\",\n\n\"path\": \"/\",\n\n\"value\": \"%VALUE%\"\n\n}\n\n**ChromePass: proprietary tool that steals saved passwords from Chromium-based browser databases. The output of the parsed**\ndatabase is an HTML document containing a table with URLs and their corresponding stolen username and password information. This\nprogram includes a descriptive command line message that explains how to use it, as outlined below.\n\n\n**_Figure 8: Command line usage of the ChromePass tool._**\n\n## Formerly Unreported Malware: USBCulprit\n\nOne of the most notable examples in Cycldek’s toolset that demonstrates both data stealing and lateral movement capabilities is a malware we\ndiscovered and dubbed USBCulrpit. This tool, which we saw downloaded by RedCore implants in several instances, is capable of scanning\nvarious paths in victim machines, collecting documents with particular extensions and passing them on to USB drives when they are\nconnected to the system. It can also selectively copy itself to a removable drive in the presence of a particular file, suggesting it can be spread\nlaterally by having designated drives infected and the executable in them opened manually.\n\nDuring the time the malware was active, it showed little change in functionality. Based on Kaspersky’s telemetry, USBCulprit has been seen in\nthe wild since 2014, with the latest samples emerging at the end of 2019. The most prominent addition incorporated to samples detected after\n2017 is the capability to execute files with a given name from a connected USB. This suggests that the malware can be extended with other\nmodules. However, we were not able to capture any such files and their purpose remains unknown.\n\nAnother change we saw is the loading scheme used for variants spotted after 2017. The older versions made use of a dropper that wrote a\nconfiguration file to disk and extracted an embedded cabinet archive containing a legitimate binary and a malicious side-loaded DLL. This was\nimproved in the newer versions, where an additional stage was added, such that the side-loaded DLL decrypts and loads a third file from the\narchive containing the malicious payload. As a result, the latter can be found in its decrypted form only in memory.\n\n\n-----\n\ns oad g sc e e de o st ates t at t e acto be d t a es use o s a s see t e p e ous y desc bed p a ts att buted to\nCycldek. For example, binaries mimicking AV components are leveraged for conducting DLL load-order hijacking. In this case, one of the files\ndropped from the cabinet archive named ‘wrapper.exe’ (originally named ‘PtUserSessionWrapper.exe’ and belonging to Trend Micro) forces\nthe execution of a malicious DLL named ‘TmDbgLog.dll’. Also, the malware makes use of an encrypted blob that is decrypted using RC4 and\nexecuted using a custom PE loader. The full chain is depicted in the figure below.\n\n**_Figure 9: USBCulprit’s loading flow, as observed in samples after 2017._**\n\nOnce USBCulprit is loaded to memory and executed, it operates in three phases:\n\n**Boostrap and data collection: this stage prepares the environment for the malware’s execution. Namely, it invokes two functions**\nnamed ‘CUSB::RegHideFileExt’ and ‘CUSB::RegHideFile’ that modify registry keys to hide the extensions of files in Windows and verify\nthat hidden files are not shown to the user. It also writes several files to disk and initializes a data structure with paths that are later used\nor searched by the malware.Additionally, the malware makes a single scan to collect files it intends to steal using a function named\n‘CUSB::USBFindFile’. They are sought by enumerating several predefined directories to locate documents with either one of the\nfollowing extensions: *.pdf;*.doc;*.wps;*docx;*ppt;*.xls;*.xlsx;*.pptx;*.rtf. Every document found is logged in a file that enlists all targeted\npaths for theft within a directory, such that every checked directory has a corresponding list file.\n\nThe chosen files are then grouped into encrypted RAR archives. To achieve that, the malware extracts a ‘rar.exe’ command line utility,\nhardcoded as a cabinet archive in its binary, and runs it against every list created in the former step. The password for the archive is initialized\nat the beginning of the malware’s execution, and is set to ‘abcd!@#$’ for most variants that we observed.\n\nIt is worth noting that sought documents can be filtered by their modification date. Several variants of USBCulprit perform a check for a file\nnamed ‘time’ within the directory from which the malware is executed. This file is expected to have a date-time value that specifies the\nmodification timestamp beyond which files are considered of interest and should be collected. If the ‘time’ file doesn’t exist, it is created with\nthe default value ‘20160601000000’ corresponding to 01/06/2016 00:00:00.\n\n**USB connection interception and data exfiltration/delivery: when bootstrapping and data collection is completed, the malware**\nattempts to intercept the connection of new media and verify that it corresponds to a removable drive. This is achieved by running an\ninfinite loop, whereby the malware is put to sleep and wakes at constant intervals to check all connected drives with the GetDriveTypeW\nfunction. If at least one is of type DRIVE_REMOVABLE, further actions are taken.\n\nWhen a USB is connected, the malware will verify if stolen data should be exfiltrated to it or it already contains existing data that should be\ncopied locally. To do this, a directory named ‘$Recyc1e.Bin’ will be searched in the drive and if not found, will be created. This directory will be\nused as the target path for copying files to the drive or source path for obtaining them from it.\n\n\n-----\n\no u de sta d c d ect o o e copy s ou d ta e p ace, a spec a a e e a ed t t s sea c ed oca y t e sts, t e a a e\nwould expect to find the aforementioned ‘$Recyc1e.Bin’ directory in the drive with previously stolen document archives and attempt to copy it\nto the disk. Otherwise, the local archive files will be copied to the same directory from the disk to the drive.\n\n**_Figure 10: USBCulprit’s check for the 1.txt marker, indicating if stolen files should be copied to the removable drive, or from it._**\n\n**Lateral movement and extension: as part of the same loop mentioned above, the existence of another marker file named ‘2.txt’ will be**\nchecked locally to decide if lateral movement should be conducted or not. Only if this file exists, will the malware’s binary be copied from\nits local path to the ‘$Recyc1e.Bin’ directory. It’s noteworthy that we were unable to spot any mechanism that could trigger the execution\nof the malware upon USB connection, which leads us to believe the malware is supposed to be run manually by a human handler.Apart\nfrom the above, USBCulprit is capable of updating itself or extending its execution with further modules. This is done by looking for the\nexistence of predefined files in the USB and executing them. Examples for these include {D14030E9-C60C-481E-B7C2-0D76810C6E96}\nand {D14030E9-C60C-481E-B7C2-0D76810C6E95}.Unfortunately, we could not obtain those files during analysis and cannot tell what\ntheir exact purpose is. We can only guess that they are used as extension modules or updated versions of the malware itself based on\ntheir behavior. The former is an archive that is extracted to a specific directory that has its files enumerated and executed using an\ninternal function named ‘CUSB::runlist’, while the latter is a binary that is copied to the %TEMP% directory and spawned as a new\nprocess.\n\nThe characteristics of the malware can give rise to several assumptions about its purpose and use cases, one of which is to reach and obtain\ndata from air-gapped machines. This would explain the lack of any network communication in the malware, and the use of only removable\nmedia as a means of transferring inbound and outbound data. Also, we witnessed some variants issue commands to gather various pieces of\nhost network information. These are logged to a file that is later transferred along with the stolen data to the USB and can help attackers profile\nwhether the machine in which the malware was executed is indeed part of a segregated network.\n\n**_Figure 11: Commands used to profile the network connectivity of the compromised host._**\n\nAnother explanation is that the malware was handled manually by operators on the ground. As mentioned earlier, there is no evident\nmechanism for automatically executing USBCulprit from infected media, and yet we saw that the same sample was executed from various\ndrive locations, suggesting it was indeed spread around. This, along with the very specific files that the malware seeks as executable\nextensions and could not be found as artifacts elsewhere in our investigation, point to a human factor being required to assist deployment of\nthe malware in victim networks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCycldek is an example of an actor that has broader capability than publicly perceived. While most known descriptions of its activity give the\nimpression of a marginal group with sub-par capabilities, the range of tools and timespan of operations show that the group has an extensive\nfoothold inside the networks of high-profile targets in Southeast Asia.\n\nFurthermore, our analysis of the implants affiliated to the group give an insight into its organizational structure. As already stated, the\nsimilarities and differences in various traits of these pieces of malware indicate that they likely originated from different arms of a single\norganization. Perhaps it’s worth noting that we noted multiple points where such entities didn’t work in a well-coordinated manner, for example,\ninfecting machines using the BlueCore implant when they were already infected with RedCore.\n\nLastly, we believe that such attacks will continue in Southeast Asian countries. The use of different tools to reach air-gapped networks in the\nsame countries and attempts to steal data from them have been witnessed in the past. Our analysis shows this type of activity has not ceased\n– it has merely evolved and changed shape, in terms of malware and actors.
