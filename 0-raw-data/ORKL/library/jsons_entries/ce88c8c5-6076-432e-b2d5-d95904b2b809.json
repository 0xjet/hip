The malware capabilities are those of a\nclassic stealer with a focus on cryptocurrency theft. As a quick summary, Mars Stealer is able\nto:\n\ncollect data from several browsers (passwords, cookies, credit cards, etc.);\nsteal credentials from crypto plugins, crypto wallets and 2FA plugins;\ngrab files;\nfingerprint the infected host.\n\nIt shares code with other information stealers including Arkei, Oski and Vidar.\n\nGiven its interesting functionalities, its ease of use and reasonable price, the Mars Stealer\nmalware has become popular on several underground forums. Moreover, the presumed\ndevelopers regularly release new versions of the malware to fix some bugs and especially to\nimprove the Mars Stealer capabilities in terms of data collection and defense evasion.\n\n\n[Mars Stealer has been recently brought to light by 3xp0rt’s in-depth analysis1](https://3xp0rt.com/posts/mars-stealer) and the\nrelease of a cracked version. In the blog post, 3xp0rt wrote an analysis of a Mars Stealer\nsample of an early version by exposing the different obfuscation methods and the data\ntargeted by the malware on the infected hosts. A few days later, some members of the\ninfosec community shared their findings on the builder and the administration panel of the\ninformation stealer. In recent days, some campaigns distributing Mars Stealer have been\n[publicly described23.](https://blog.morphisec.com/threat-research-mars-stealer)\n\nSEKOIA.IO analysts have been monitoring the threat on underground forums to be up-todate on the latest developments. We have also recently carried out an in-depth analysis of\nsamples of different versions of Mars Stealer, and noticed many changes in the obfuscation\ntechniques.\n\n## Why investigate the Mars Stealer malware?\n\n\nInformation stealers are a threat to be considered, as many threat actors are using them to\nharvest credentials and other personal information. The stolen data can then be sold on\nunderground forums and then possibly leveraged in “Big Game Hunting” operations, as the\n[Lapsus$ threat group does .4](https://www.sekoia.io/en/lapsus-when-kiddies-play-in-the-big-league/)\n\nAmong these information stealers, Mars Stealer has become an emerging threat in recent\nmonths\n\n\n-----\n\nFirst of all, the malware is widely advertised on numerous underground forums and the\npublications reach a large audience. Furthermore, users of Mars Stealer usually give good\nfeedback and do not hesitate to recommend it when forum members are looking for an\ninformation stealer. The Mars Stealer malware therefore appeared in our Dark Web\nmonitoring during the second half of 2021.\n\n_Figure 1. Positive feedback on the Mars Stealer software and service on the XSS forum_\n\n_Figure 2. Users’ comments advising Mars Stealer on the XSS publication named “Raccoon_\n_or Mars Stealer”_\n\nDynamic of ransomware activity in Q1 2022\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Download](https://blog.sekoia.io/mars-a-red-hot-information-stealer/)**\nIt is worth noting that Mars Stealer is under continuous development and the project is\nprofessionally maintained, which makes it attractive and trustworthy to potential clients.\nIndeed, the presumed developers (MarsTeam) regularly collect user feedback on posts on\nthe underground forums, on the Telegram support channel or on Jabber. MarsTeam then\ntakes this feedback into account to make improvements, new features or bug fixes. New\nversions are regularly released and accompanied by a changelog to list the notable changes\nmade to the Mars Stealer agent and also the panel.\n\n_Figure 3. Changelog of the Mars Stealer version 8 published on the XSS forum_\n\nFurthermore, the malware appeared in OSINT reports in early 2022, especially with the great\n3xp0rt’s in-depth analysis. Since then, its occurrence has increased in the infosec community\nbecause of the publication of its builder and above all, some campaigns distributing Mars\nStealer have been brought to light in the Cyber Threat Intelligence sphere.\n\nLast, the abrupt shutdown of Raccoon Stealer operations, which is one of the most\nwidespread stealers, leaves a significant part of the market for the information stealers.\nIndeed, on March 25, 2022, the profile raccoonstealer announced on the Russian-speaking\nunderground forum XSS that the group operating Raccoon Stealer closed the project for an\nundetermined period of time. This unexpected shutdown is due to the loss of a developer of\nthe project Raccoon Stealer during the “special operation”, in reference to the Russian war in\nUkraine.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Raccoonstealer’s statement on the shutdown of the Raccoon Stealer project on the_\n_XSS forum_\n\nA publication of MarsTeam on the XSS forum fully confirmed this hypothesis. On March 24,\n2022, MarsTeam responded to two potential clients:\n\n“Guys, deal with the message backlog, will reply to all within 24 hours. A lot of people came\n_from Raccoon. We do not have time to process all messages physically.“” (translated from_\nRussian)\n\n_Figure 5. MarsTeam mentioning a wave of clients coming from Raccoon on the XSS forum_\n\nFor all of the above reasons it seems relevant to us to monitor the Mars Stealer threat, to\nstay-up-to-date on the development of the malware and to track Indicators of Compromise\n(IoCs) to detect Mars Stealer. These two points are the subject of the next parts.\n\n## A journey with the malware developers\n\nIn this part, we analyze the publications and the activities of the presumed Mars Stealer\ndevelopers (MarsTeam) on underground forums. According to our Dark Web monitoring,\n_MarsTeam is active on numerous underground forums including XSS.is, lolz.guru and bhf.io._\nHowever, we focus on the XSS forum as MarsTeam publishes first, and more frequently on\nthis one.\n\nOn May 21, 2021, the Mars Stealer team joined the XSS underground forum under the name\n_MarsTeam with a deposit of 0.009 Bitcoin ($336 at May 2021 exchange rate). One month_\nlater, MarsTeam opened a new discussion whose title translated from Russian is “Mars\n\n\n-----\n\nStealer – a native, non-resident stealer with loader and stealer functionality .\n\n_Figure 6. First publication of MarsTeam advertising Mars Stealer_\n\nThe publication introduces Mars Stealer as “a new software developed for people working\n_with crypto” – to be interpreted: for people who want to steal cryptocurrencies. The malware_\nis sold with the malware-as-a-service model for $140 per month.\n\n## Mars Stealer capabilities\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the Mars Stealer capabilities advertised by MarsTeam are\nthose of a classic information stealer with a specific focus on cryptocurrency theft. Our\ntechnical analysis of Mars Stealer confirmed that the applications targeted by the malware\nsamples are those described in the MarsTeam publications.\n\nThe stealer collects personal information from numerous browsers: passwords, cookies,\ncredit cards, autofill data, history of websites visited and files downloaded. The list of\nsupported browsers is quite wide, from the most popular (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer,\nMicrosoft Edge, Firefox, etc.) to the less common. Mars Stealer collects this data in the\ndefault path of the different browser user data, or browser profiles.\n\nThe theft of cryptocurrencies is one of its distinguishing features, MarsTeam specifies that:\n“Important feature that makes us stand out from competitors is the collection of browser\n_plugins with an emphasis on cryptocurrency and 2FA plugins” (translated from Russian)._\nIndeed, the list of targeted crypto plugins is very long with more than 40 references, including\nthe most used (Coinbase, MetaMask, Binance). The same goes for the list of crypto wallets\nand 2FA plugins targeted by the information stealer.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware also fingerprints the infected host to collect information about hardware,\ninstalled software and other personal information. Mars Stealer collects these data using\nWinAPI calls such as GetSystemInfo, GetCurrentProcess or by requesting the Windows\nRegistry keys such as HARDWARE\\DESCRIPTION\\System\\CentralProcessor\\0,\n_SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall._\n\nLast but not least, Mars Stealer acts as a file grabber which is easily customizable by the\noperator. MarsTeam describes it as “a powerful feature” as the start path, file extension, file\nsize and the recursive search can be set up. It also captures a screenshot of the victim’s\ndesktop, loads files on the infected machine and executes them with arguments.\n\n## High-quality service for malware operators\n\nIn addition to the stealing agent, Mars Stealer is sold with the administration panel and\ncustomer support. It is worth noting that the malware operator must host the Command &\nControl (C2) server and associated panel on its own server to access the stolen data.\n_MarsTeam insists on the fact that all the traffic is available only for the customer and does_\nnot pass through a server of the Mars Stealer developers. This functionality is often\nrequested by information stealer users who want to control and own all the data.\n\nIn the first MarsTeam’s publication, the Mars Stealer administration panel is described as “a\n_powerful data search functionality” and the user experience seems to be a priority in the_\ndevelopment of Mars Stealer. MarsTeam describes multiple capabilities of the panel on\nwhich the operator can easily manage, sort, filter, and remove the logs.\n\nMoreover, the purchase of Mars Stealer includes a high-quality service including the support\nof all issues, the access to the customer chat and the new releases of the malware.\n\nAll the malware capabilities accompanied by a user-friendly interface and quality support\nmake Mars Stealer very attractive and popular to attackers on underground markets.\n\n## Underground forum presence\n\nThe responsiveness of the Mars Stealer team on the underground forums sends a positive\nmessage to potential customers. MarsTeam is not only responsive to user requests, but also\nvery active on several underground forums. Since the first communication on Mars Stealer in\nJune 2021, MarsTeam has regularly published changelogs to announce new malware\nreleases, as shown by the following figure. Special offers or teasing new features are also\nthe subject of many of MarsTeam‘s posts.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Timeline of MarsTeam’s major publications on the XSS forum_\n\nLet us consider the releases of new Mars Stealer versions on the XSS forum. Most of these\nchangelogs include new features, improvements, or bug fixes both on the agent and the\nadministration panel. We noticed that the early versions did not have a version number. The\nofficial versioning started with version 4 released on August 21, 2021, so we approximately\nassociated the first versions to MarsTeam’s early changelogs. Most of them are divided into\ntwo sections: on the software and the administration panel.\n\nSoftware improvements are focused on the coverage of targeted applications by adding new\nbrowsers or new crypto plugins, as well as the upgrade of defense evasion techniques. For\nexample, version 7 introduced the support of the Google Beta browser and numerous crypto\nplugins, which increased the number of collectable crypto plugins to 101. Version 6 brings\nnew evasion methods for VM and antiviruses.\n\nImprovements achieved on the web administration panel aim to facilitate the user experience\nby giving new possibilities of sorting, filtering and searching for stolen data. The Mars Stealer\ndeveloper also optimized the performance related to the SQL database.\n\nThe analysis of the MarsTeam’s publications on different underground forums shows that the\npresumed Mars Stealer professionally works on software development, but also on\ncommunication and support. This conscientiousness seems to seduce the attackers who\nwant to buy and use an information stealer well maintained and in continuous enhancement.\n\n## How to collect Mars Stealer IoCs?\n\nIn the previous part, we showed how Mars Stealer has become an emerging threat and why\nwe must be interested in it. In this part we see how to collect Mars Stealer IoCs based on\nYARA signatures, C2 server tracker and the automated extraction of the malware\nconfiguration. The last method requires a technical analysis of Mars Stealer and its versions\nwhich implement different obfuscation techniques. This in-depth analysis is the subject of the\npart named Mars Stealer objective C2.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Collecting Mars Stealer samples\n\n### Early versions\n\nBefore analyzing the different versions of the Mars Stealer malware, a first step consists of\ncollecting the malware samples. We have therefore written a YARA rule based on the sample\nshared in the 3xp0rt analysis to identify other Mars Stealer samples.\n\nA reliable method to detect samples of a malware family consists in searching for operation\ncode (opcode) patterns used in the deobfuscation routine. In the early versions, the malware\nimplemented a deobfuscation function which first decodes base64-encoded strings and then\ndecrypts RC4-encrypted strings. This algorithm is applied on numerous obfuscated strings\nas shown in the following figure, which corresponds to the function loading obfuscated\nstrings.\n\n_Figure 8. Function loading obfuscated strings in a Mars Stealer early version sample_\n\nFour instructions are repeated for each obfuscated data: push, call, add and mov. A YARA\nrule identifying this version of Mars Stealer can be written based on the repetition of these\nopcodes. Adding to the detection pattern some specific strings can fine-tune the rule in order\nto identify only Mars Stealer binaries. Here is a possible YARA rule to find Mars Stealer\nsamples:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule infostealer_win_mars_stealer_early_version {\n  meta:\n    description = \"Identifies samples of Mars Stealer early version based on\nopcodes of the function loading obfuscated strings.\"\n    source = \"SEKOIA.IO\"\n    reference = \"https://blog.sekoia.io/mars-a-red-hot-information-stealer/\"\n    classification = \"TLP:WHITE\"\n    hash = \"7da3029263bfbb0699119a715ce22a3941cf8100428fd43c9e1e46bf436ca687\"\n  strings:\n    $dec = {a3 ?? ?? ?? ?? 68 ?? ?? ?? ?? e8 ?? ?? 00 00 83 c4 ??}\n    $api00 = \"LoadLibrary\" ascii\n    $api01 = \"GetProcAddress\" ascii\n    $api02 = \"ExitProcess\" ascii\n    $api03 = \"advapi32.dll\" ascii\n    $api04 = \"crypt32.dll\" ascii\n    $api05 = \"GetTickCount\" ascii\n    $api06 = \"Sleep\" ascii\n    $api07 = \"GetUserDefaultLangID\" ascii\n    $api08 = \"CreateMutex\" ascii\n    $api09 = \"GetLastError\" ascii\n    $api10 = \"HeapAlloc\" ascii\n    $api11 = \"GetProcessHeap\" ascii\n    $api12 = \"GetComputerName\" ascii\n    $api13 = \"VirtualProtect\" ascii\n    $api14 = \"GetUserName\" ascii\n    $api15 = \"CryptStringToBinary\" ascii\n    $str0 = \"JohnDoe\" ascii\n  condition:\n    uint16(0)==0x5A4D and\n    #dec > 400 and 12 of ($api*) and $str0\n}\n\n```\n_Figure 9. YARA rule identifying Mars Stealer early version samples_\n\nWe shared the rule on sample sharing platforms and collected several results from this\nYARA rule. As expected from our Dark Web monitoring, we observed different Mars Stealer\nversions based on their deobfuscation routine among our collected samples. We also noticed\nseveral samples for which a new PE section name appeared: LLCPPC. More details on the\ndifferent versions can be found in the following technical analysis.\n\n### LLCPPC versions\n\nThe PE section name LLCPPC is a highly discriminating factor of the Mars Stealer malware.\nWe can therefore easily identify Mars Stealer samples using this characteristic in a YARA\nrule using the PE module:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nimport pe \nrule infostealer_win_mars_stealer_llcppc {\n  meta:\n    description = \"Identifies samples of Mars Stealer based on the PE section\nname LLCPPC.\"\n    source = \"SEKOIA.IO\"\n    reference = \"https://blog.sekoia.io/mars-a-red-hot-information-stealer/\"\n    classification = \"TLP:WHITE\"\n    hash = \"fd92fe8a4534bc6e14e177fee38a13f771a091fa6c7171fcee2791c58fbecf40\"\n  condition:\n    uint16(0)==0x5A4D and\n    for any i in ( 0..pe.number_of_sections-1 ): (\n        pe.sections[i].name == \"LLCPPC\" and pe.sections[i].raw_data_size <\n5000 )\n}\n\n```\n_Figure 10. YARA rule identifying Mars Stealer samples based on the PE section name_\n\nFor information, LLCPPC is a profile on the underground forum lolz.guru that reverses\nengineer some popular malware (Redline, Mars Stealer, DCRat, X-FILES and SHurkSteal) in\norder to debunk the misleading information used to advertise the product.\n\nThe developer of Mars Stealer probably named the PE section of the malware to rag\n_LLCPPC after the analysis of the malware which revealed untruths in the malware’s_\nadvertisement. On August 24, 2021, LLCPPC published a technical analysis of a Mars\nStealer sample with the title “Mars Stealer is the worst stealer | How the shit coder cheats on\n_you”._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. LLCPPC’s publication debunking a Mars Stealer sample on the lolz.guru forum_\n\nIn this analysis, LLCPPC concludes that only encryption and the secure import address table\nare the pros of Mars Stealer while the list of cons is much longer. Among them, LLCPPC\nraised the non-optimized code, the lack of debugging and virtualization evasion, the absence\nof multithreading, etc. As shown by the previous figure, LLCPPC also mentioned that the\nMars Stealer sample is well detected by VirusTotal and Any.Run analysis, unlike MarsTeam\nstated.\n\n### Latest version (version 8)\n\nThe LLCPPC section disappeared in the latest version of Mars Stealer, which corresponds to\nversion 8 according to the MarsTeam releases on XSS. Indeed, samples of the latest Mars\nStealer version only send one request to retrieve the DLLs (freebl3.dll, mozglue.dll,\n_msvcp140.dll, nss3.dll, softokn3.dll, sqlite3.dll and vcruntime140.dll). These files are linked to_\nlegitimate third-party DLLs allowing Mars Stealer to collect data from the infected host. As\n\n\n-----\n\nwritten by MarsTeam in the version 8 release notes _now the software makes one request_\n_after the request file, which contains all necessary libraries for correct work of the software”_\n(translated from Russian), it therefore corresponds to version 8 samples.\n\nCommunication with the C2 server is performed over HTTP, and since version 6, the stealer\ncan use HTTPS.\n\n_Figure 12: HTTP communication with the C2 server_\n\n1. Implant sends a GET request to the C2 URL to grab its configuration.\n2. Implant fetches all DLLs on the “/request” endpoint, the libraries are zipped (c.f. figure\n\n13).\n3. Stolen data are posted to the C2 on the same URL used in step (1).\n\n_Figure 13: HTTP response on /request that contains all DLLs zipped_\n\nTo identify and collect these samples, we can again write a YARA rule based on the string\ndeobfuscation routine since the discriminating section name is no longer used. From our\ntechnical analysis, we identify the deobfuscation routine based on XOR keys, which is further\ndetailed in the “Mars Stealer objective C2” section. The algorithm consists in xoring each\nobfuscated string and its corresponding key.\n\nOur resulting YARA rule is:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule infostealer_win_mars_stealer_xor_routine {\n  meta:\n    description = \"Identifies samples of Mars Stealer based on the XOR\ndeobfuscation routine.\"\n    source = \"SEKOIA.IO\"\n    reference = \"https://blog.sekoia.io/mars-a-red-hot-information-stealer/\"\n    classification = \"TLP:WHITE\"\n    hash = \"4bcff4386ce8fadce358ef0dbe90f8d5aa7b4c7aec93fca2e605ca2cbc52218b\"\n  strings:\n    $xor = {8b 4d ?? 03 4d ?? 0f be 19 8b 55 ?? 52 e8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 c4 ?? 8b c8\n8b 45 ?? 33 d2 f7 f1 8b 45 ?? 0f be 0c 10 33 d9 8b 55 ?? 03 55 ?? 88 1a eb be}\n  condition:\n    uint16(0)==0x5A4D and $xor\n}\n\n```\n_Figure 14. YARA rule identifying the XOR routine implemented by Mars Stealer_\n\nTo conclude this section, we would like to mention another rather classical but very efficient\nmethod to collect and classify the malware samples based on the PE creation time. Indeed,\nmany unpacked Mars Stealer samples share identical PE creation dates, making them easy\nto identify on sample sharing platforms: “2021-08-12T17:45:33” and “2022-01-05T14:09:08”.\n\nThe Command & Control infrastructures of cyber attackers observed in 2021 by SEKOIA.IO\n\n**[Download](https://hubs.ly/Q017Jz330)**\n\n## Tracking Mars Stealer C2 servers\n\nTracking servers used to host malware C2 servers or more widely adversary infrastructures\n[is a proactive hunting approach we have intensively developed at SEKOIA.IO .5](https://blog.sekoia.io/centralization-of-edr-alerts-new-detections-and-trackers-the-novelties-of-november-2021/) Concerning\nthe Mars Stealer malware, C2 servers are hosted by the attackers and not by the malware\ndeveloper. This makes it more difficult or even impossible to identify a heuristic based on the\nHTTP response to find the malware C2 servers, as each attacker should configure its own\nHTTP server hosting the Mars Stealer administration panel.\n\nHowever, a good and simple method to track the widely sold malware consists in finding\nservers hosting one of the characteristic web pages of the administration panel. By searching\nthe hash of these specific web pages (JavaScript, PHP or HTML pages) on URL scanning\nplatforms, we can identify the servers used by the malware to download payloads and\nexfiltrate the stolen information.\n\nConcerning the Mars Stealer administration panel, we can track several pages which are\nspecific to the malware panel. For example:\n\n\n-----\n\n_d8f09307b60c5bef5ceacfd8501bd3d91f1de9e5e746bb2d7def94d86789da50 and_\n_304288329069ad8eaafce0f10a369101607c9248fbc9aaaa733c9e2dab5c467f are_\nspecific to the Mars Stealer PHP login pages (login.php). The first hash corresponds to\nthe login page of the version 8 of Mars Stealer, while the second corresponds to the\nlogin page of the version 7 and below. We were able to confirm these results from the\nleaked source code of the administration panel.\n_9faf0345bf0785854343b9303734c2f4d3adba818cb408dcc6e2384ccc8a7aa2 and_\n_20e6bb3cf9d13f10bca7b7b5d1f4cb82146c274747e8c2ae7fe3307881f00829 are_\nspecific to CSS pages used by the Mars Stealer login page (bootstrap.min.css).\n\n_Figure 15. Login page of the Mars Stealer administration panel_\n\n[From this information, we can write a heuristic on urlscan.io6](https://urlscan.io/search/#hash%3A(20e6bb3cf9d13f10bca7b7b5d1f4cb82146c274747e8c2ae7fe3307881f00829%20OR%20304288329069ad8eaafce0f10a369101607c9248fbc9aaaa733c9e2dab5c467f%20OR%209faf0345bf0785854343b9303734c2f4d3adba818cb408dcc6e2384ccc8a7aa2%20OR%20d8f09307b60c5bef5ceacfd8501bd3d91f1de9e5e746bb2d7def94d86789da50)) (or other similar services) like:\n```\nhash:(20e6bb3cf9d13f10bca7b7b5d1f4cb82146c274747e8c2ae7fe3307881f00829 OR\n304288329069ad8eaafce0f10a369101607c9248fbc9aaaa733c9e2dab5c467f OR\n9faf0345bf0785854343b9303734c2f4d3adba818cb408dcc6e2384ccc8a7aa2 OR\nd8f09307b60c5bef5ceacfd8501bd3d91f1de9e5e746bb2d7def94d86789da50)\n\n```\nOn April 7, 2022, this query resulted in 43 URLs which hosted a Mars Stealer administration\npanel.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16. Urlscan.io results on the heuristic identifying Mars Stealer login pages_\n\nThis method is based on URL submissions and, unfortunately, is not as proactive as\nheuristics based on the HTTP response. But it has the merit of collecting network IoCs\n(domain names or IP addresses) over time. Moreover, the webpages of the malware\nadministration panel rarely changes, unlike the source code of the agent. It is therefore a\ngood way to track a malware family over time and then pivot to new samples that might not\nbe detected by our YARA rules.\n\nAnother way of tracking Mars Stealer C2 servers is to pivot on the file request\n(3de1fb0d1108907fd61d6d6b9a4c6b856af509e0af35578f158cfce5d634fe07) which is the\narchive containing the legitimate DLLs. All Mars Stealer samples of version 8 request this\nresource. For example, on VirusTotal, some C2 servers can be identified hosting the zip file\nand samples requesting it.\n\nIn conclusion, we are tracking the Mars Stealer threat by different means which allows us to\ncollect network and system IoCs. Another technique we used to collect Mars Stealer C2\nURLs consists of extracting them from the samples. The next part is focused on our in-depth\nanalysis of several Mars Stealer versions, which allowed us to implement a configuration\nextractor.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mars Stealer objective C2\n\nAn in-depth analysis of this malware has been done by 3xp0rt, the article describes how the\nstrings are loaded, the checks performed against the infected hosts (languages, antiemulation, e.g.: John Doe & HALT9), the cookies and crypto wallets extraction, the C2\nexfiltration and configuration grabbing. In our context, the analysis here is focused on the\nCommand and Control configuration moreover, on how to automatically extract it. To answer\nthis need, an analysis of the different versions of the malware and on how the C2 URL is\ndeobfuscated and loaded in PE is required. From this analysis, we tried to identify the Mars\nStealer releases based on the MarsTeam publications on XSS forum.\n\n## Mars Stealer main functionalities\n\nThe figure below briefly introduces what Mars Stealer core function looks like (for more\n[details checks 3xp0rt in-depth analysis )1](https://3xp0rt.com/posts/mars-stealer), its main function could be split in 8 units described\nbelow:\n\n1. Load static string: this function prepares the malware to load further libraries and\n\nfunctions and setup the decryption key;\n2. Link basic function to setup malware functionalities for step 3 to 4 includes;\n3. Anti-debugging / Anti-emulation:\n\n1. Check time\n2. Check Windows Defender sandbox\n4. Decrypt all strings: this includes other libraries’ function name, strings used by the\n\nstealer (e.g. SQL requests for cookies extraction);\n5.

As mentioned previously in the analysis of publications on underground\nforums, MarsTeam tries to improve its product with each release (bug fix, some obfuscation\n& new functionalities). Release advertisements on the XSS forum might not match what has\nbeen identified as a version in this article. The version identification process is based on how\nthe malware stores and deobfuscates its C2, which could lead to version overlap of the\nannounced versions by MarsTeam and our work.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe next section describes the first and older technique used by Mars Stealer to load its C2,\nwhich involved retrieving the RC4 key and spotting the position of the Command and Control\nin the PE.\n\n## String loading\n\nOne of the first functions of the malware aims to load a small set of strings, which are used a\n[bit later with the two known functions of Kernel32.dll:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/system-services?redirectedfrom=MSDN) _[LoadLibrary and](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya)_ _[GetProcAddress.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress)_\nThese two functions are used for further functions and library loading. In this same function\n(load_string), the first string loaded is twenty bytes long, which appears to be the key used to\ndecrypt (RC4) strings of the malware.\n\nThose obfuscated strings are stored in the .data section in this given format: encrypted string\n[with RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4) algorithm stored in base64. Figure below shows how the RC4\nkey is loaded.\n\n_Figure 18. RC4 key loading_\n\nFor example, for the following string: “K3vgIP3rMlysQNU=“:\n\n1. The base64-decoded string is 2b7be020fdeb325cac40d5.\n2. The RC4-decrypted string with the key 85297062256884302049 is “MachineGuid”.\n\nRC4 key retrieving is the first step to get the C2 in clear text. Then, finding the offset of the\nstring that contains the C2 is the objective. This strings are the third and the fourth string\nloaded and decrypted in the function decrypt_string.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 19. Offset of C2 encoded in base64 and encrypted with RC4_ _(addresses: 0x4131f4_\n_and 0x413210)_\n\nIn one of the most recent releases, a new section was created by the Mars Stealer authors.\nThe C2 location is now at an offset defined in the LLCPPC code, c.f. figure 20. This version\nand its upgrade are analyzed in depth in the next three sections.\n\n## A new section entered the ring\n\nAs introduced in the section “Collecting Mars Stealer samples”, a new section with the\nsingular name LLCPPC has been introduced in the Mars Stealer PE structure.\n\nThe structure of this section has evolved during the different releases. First of all, this section\nwas composed of one segment that contains code used by the malware, and then authors\nadd data, sometimes in clear text or obfuscated.\n\nThe new section of malware has the given structure:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 20. LLCPPC section structure_\n\nIn the previous LLCPPC section structure, the C2 URL is in clear text, that means it is not\nobfuscated and the XOR key is not used. However, in most samples, the C2 URL is\nobfuscated with the XOR key.\n\nThree different versions of this section have been observed during our investigation. The first\nversion of this section is the one using RC4 encryption on the C2 located in the data section,\nthen in next version malware developers append at the bottom of the section the C2 and\nchange the obfuscation method. Data can be obfuscated with XOR operation or can be\nstored in clear text.\n\n### LLCPPC with RC4 encryption\n\nThe simplest version of the LLCPPC section only contains code. The code is in charge of\nloading the obfuscated string from a specific offset and calling the deobfuscation function\n(e.g. base64 decode plus RC4 decryption).\n\n_Figure 21. IDA decompilation of the function “decrypt_string” that calls a function in LLCPPC_\n_section to load the C2_\n\n\n-----\n\nMalware developers had replaced the C2 decryption (see figure 21) by a call to the function\nlocated at the beginning of the LLCPPC section, oddly followed by multiple NOP operations.\n\nThe calling function of the LLCPPC section is the following one:\n\n_Figure 22. IDA decompilation of the C2 loading before its decryption (RC4)_\n\n1. The call edx is a call to the kernel32.dll function GetModuleHandleA used to return the\n\nhandle to the file that is loaded, where the request module here is 0, this is a trick to\nreturn the base address of the PE.\n2. From this address an offset is computed (different in each Mars Stealer sample): lea\n\n_eax, [edi + 0x16d40], edi which holds the base address of the PE._\n3. Then, a call esi is performed, register esi contains the address of the function that\n\ndecodes base64 and decrypts RC4. This function is located in the .text section and is\nused to decrypt other strings of the malware. This is the same function that is called\nmultiple times by decrypt_string.\n4. Finally, the decoded and decrypted string is then stored at a specific location with mov\n\n_dword [edi + 0x177b0], eax; the edi register still contains the base address of the PE._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 23. IDA decompilation of the C2 bozkurtoot[.]dev loading after its decryption (RC4)_\n\nThe deobfuscation process is called twice, once for the C2 IP address or domain name and\nfor the URL path as highlighted in the figure above.\n\n### LLCPPC with embedded data\n\nAs mentioned previously, some versions of this section embed data, those data appear to be\nthe C2 (IP address or domain name) plus its URL path.\n\nFrom now two variants exist, one with the C2 in clear text (c.f. figure 24) and a variant where\nthe C2 is xored (c.f. figure 25):\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 24. Radare2 dump of LLCPPC section with C2 in clear text_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 25. Radare2 dump of LLCPPC section with C2 obfuscated_\n\nA dynamic analysis helps to identify how the C2 was obfuscated and where its obfuscation\nkey was stored.\n\nThe deobfuscation function (c.f. figure 27) determines the string length, then loads the C2\nand xor key from a known offset located in the LLCPPC section to finally call the function that\nunxors data. Besides, this function is located in the .text section and is also used for other\nstrings deobfuscation.\n\nIn fact, the obfuscated C2 could be read in clear text with the short following Python snippet\nof code:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\ndef unxor(string: iterable, key: iterable) > str:\n  \"\"\"Method to unxor obfuscated data from llcppc section\"\"\"\n  unxored = \"\"\n  for c1, c2 in zip(key, string):\n      unxored += chr(c1 ^ c2)\n  return unxored\n\n```\n_Figure 26. Function deobfuscating data from LLCPPC section_\n\nThe function responsible for the string unxor data is the following one:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 27. IDA decompilation of function responsible to unxor string_\n\nAs observed while computing analysis on multiple samples using XOR obfuscation and data\nstored in the LLCPPC section (c.f. figure 20). The obfuscated C2 target, C2 URL path and\nXOR key are located at the same position for each sample of this version; this indicates a\nstatic assignment of the location by the authors.\n\nC2 target offset is: `LLCPPC base address + 0x200 .`\n\n\n-----\n\nC2 target clear text is in the .data section: `0x41A800 .`\nC2 URL path offset is: `LLCPPC base address + 0x280 .`\nC2 URL path clear text is in .data section: `0x41A2A0 .`\nXOR key for C2 target and C2 URL path is: `LLCPPC base address + 0x300 .`\n\nThe mechanism described in the above section to get the C2 might be assigned to version 4\nand above. A new variant then came with virtual machines and environment analysis\ndetection.\n\nLLCPPC Anti VM mechanism\n\nThe Mars Stealer team has updated its C2 loading; some anti-VM checks have been\nintroduced in a new version. As shown by the figure below, the malware loops over the\nrunning process looking for particular process names. This version checks if a process\ncontains VBOX or if a process is named q.exe which is a the Sysinternal tool: Rootkit\n[detection utility .8](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/rootkit-revealer) In case none of the suspicious processes is identified, the malware\nallocated a virtual memory space for the Mars Stealer core function (c.f. figure 17) and then\nexecute it (c.f. figure 28, “jmp eax”).\n\n_Figure 28. Anti-VM mechanism_\n\nThe C2 loading method for this version does not differ that much from other LLCPPC\nversions. Indeed, after the virtual memory allocation of Mars Stealer core function followed\nby the jump into this new allocated memory area, the code of Mars Stealer remains the same\n\n\n-----\n\nas the one described in the Mars Stealer capabilities section. However, from a scripting\npoint of view it will be required to look a step further to find out the “OEP” (Original Entry\nPoint).\n\nLLCPPC left the game: Mars Stealer V8\n\nAs explained previously in the section “Collecting Mars Stealer samples”, the last version has\nevolved, both the C2 server and the implant benefit from some upgrades. From the implant\npoint of view, two major functionalities were introduced:\n\n1. Downloaded DLLs are now grouped in a single ZIP file named and fetched from the\n\n“/request” URL.\n2. A new anti-analysis check is introduced.\n\nThe C2 is obfuscated using the same techniques as described in the section “LLCPPC with\nembedded data”, but for this version, obfuscated data are located in the .rdata section.\nMoreover, each part of the C2, the IP address or the domain name and the URL path, has\ntheir own XOR key. The structure of the code does not change regarding the previous\nversion with XOR obfuscation; the xored string is followed in the PE structure by its XOR\nkey.\n\n_Figure 29. Obfuscated C2 IP address followed by its XOR key_\n\nThis simple version 8 of Mars Stealer does not represent the trend we observed during our\n[tracking session, various samples identified as version 8 are packed with Themida .9](https://www.oreans.com/Themida.php)\n\n**Extra analysis notes**\n\nAs mentioned in the past section, the samples retrieved from VirusTotal were identified with\nonly two different RC4 keys: 8529706225688430204 and 86223203794583053453 with\nmassive usage of the first one. We cannot affirm that one key is linked to a specific release,\nnor a selling batch, nor a threat actor (this hypothesis does not make sense here, in a\nmalware-as-a-service context).\n\nThe XOR key located at the end of the LLCPPC section is repeatedly present even if no\nobfuscation is applied on the C2 (c.f. figure 24).\n\n\n-----\n\nSome older (below version 7) Mars Stealer samples came packed with a VMProtect layer,\nrelated hashes are:\n\n_a6cd1f6158ce5a16bd500218333e81fcb6ecd960da3cfa0c1b701a5cf9f98dec_\n_8ded24590c991f33438fe38f3ae10e91672369b1f029bf339a94d74c8645932a_\n_af503eb7e314b4a8acb2ef849fc7cea7f273fa9544b40904314b651859b66a17_\n\n**SEKOIA.IO interaction**\n\nMalware C2 loading and deobfuscation have been analyzed in their different versions and\n[the behavior of the multiple versions are now identified. A FAME module10](https://certsocietegenerale.github.io/fame/) to automatically\nextract Command and Control has been developed. This module uses the Python library\n[r2pipe11](https://www.radare.org/n/r2pipe.html) to interact with the PE file.\n\n\nTwice a week, one of our workers of the SEKOIA Malware Watcher project pulls samples\nfrom VirusTotal that match our YARA rule mentioned in the “Collecting Mars Stealer samples”\nsection and submits these samples to our FAME instance. C2 are extracted via FAME and\nfinally pushed contextualized to SEKOIA.IO with the relationship indicating the Mars Stealer\nmalware.\n\n_Figure 29. From VirusTotal to SEKOIA.IO with FAME_\n\nThe FAME module will be release as Open Source on the SEKOIA.IO public Github\n[repository named fame_module12.
