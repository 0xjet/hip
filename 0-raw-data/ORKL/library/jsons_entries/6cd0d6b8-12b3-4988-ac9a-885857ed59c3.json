More people are investing in different\ncryptocurrencies than ever before, given how accessible it is in the current market.\n\nCryptocurrency’s primary appeal is its decentralized, self-governed nature and ease of transaction. Crypto wallets like\nMetamask, Coinbase, Binance, and Exodus are the medium of choice for many to manage and transact\ncryptocurrency.\n\nAs Cryptocurrency is gaining popularity worldwide, it may replace regular currency to some extent in the future.\n\nHowever, this is not without its downsides. Cryptocurrency also acts as an enabler for phishing, scams, hacking, and\nother malicious activities due to its decentralized nature. Figure 1 highlights a few incidences of crypto phishing where\nthe Threat Actors (TAs) have targeted the Metamask wallet and stolen cryptocurrency.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 – Metamask_\n\n_scam tweets_\nDuring our routine Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) research, Cyble Research Labs came across certain phishing\nsites distributing malware targeting the Metamask application. Metamask is a popular cryptocurrency wallet that\ninteracts with the Ethereum BlockChain and allows users to access the Ethereum wallet through a web browser or\nmobile app.\n\nThis particular malware targets both Android and iOS Metamask users and steals seed phrases from the victim’s\ndevice.\n\nA seed phrase is a sequence of words used to access a cryptocurrency wallet. Threat Actors (TAs) can compromise\ncrypto wallets and steal various cryptocurrencies from the victim’s Metamask account by stealing the seed phrase.\n\nOur analysis indicates that the objective of the malware is to steal cryptocurrency and specifically target users based\nout of China. The below image shows the TAs C&C login panel, which stores all the stolen information.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 – Login Page of C&C Panel_\n\nCyble Research Labs observed that the malicious package is hosted on over ten different phishing sites (details are\nshared in the IOCs section below).\n\nWe believe that the user could have received a spam SMS or email containing a phishing URL. When users first visit\n[the phishing URL, they will see a page similar to a legitimate Metamask website, as shown in Figure 3.](https://metamask.io/)\n\nThe phishing site uses the icon and name of the Metamask wallet in addition to copying the UI of the genuine\nMetamask website to trick the user. Figure 3 shows the phishing site and genuine Metamask website, where it is\ndifficult to distinguish between legitimate and fake websites.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 – Phishing vs._\n\n_Genuine site_\nUpon investigating the phishing website, we observed that the TAs had changed the URL of the “Download now”\nbutton, which downloads the malicious package. However, the rest of the controls on the phishing website, such as\nfeatures, support, etc., point to the legitimate Metamask site to appear genuine to potential victims.\n\nWhen users interact with the ‘Download’ button, they are redirected to the download options page, where the user can\ndownload the app for iOS, Chrome, and Android.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 –_\n\n_Download options for users_\nIf users click on the Chrome download option, they are redirected to the Chrome web store, and they can then\ndownload the genuine Metamask extension. This activity confirms that the Threat Actor only targets iOS and Android\nMetamask users.\n\n_Figure 5 –_\n\n_Redirecting user to Chrome Web Store_\nWhen a user clicks on “Install Metamask for iPhone,” it takes them to this phishing site\n“hxxps://jpvzhy[.]com/y4BU[.]html“.\n\nThe site loads a page with a QR code, which will then download a malicious app targeting iPhone Metamask users.\n\n\n-----\n\n_QR code for downloading iOS malicious app_\nFor Android, the site will download the Android malware file named “matemask.apk,” as shown below.\n\n_Downloading the malicious Android app_\n\n## APK Analysis\n\n\n_Figure 6 –_\n\n_Figure 7 –_\n\n\nWhile analyzing the downloaded APK file, we observed that the genuine application had been modified with malicious\ncode to steal the wallet’s seed phrase.\n\n### APK Metadata Information\n\nApp Name: Metamask\nPackage Name: io.Metamask\nSHA256 Hash: d918019edb12a3d8542d0905256fd5ce56fe515a7bbce77d27494e13def4b3ee\n\nFigure 8 shows the metadata information of an application.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 – App Metadata_\n\n_Information_\nFigure 9 shows the Android interface for victim devices with the application icon and name.\n\n_Figure 9 – App Icon and Name_\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon analyzing the manifest file, we observed that the package name and class name were the same, making the\napp appear genuine to potential victims.\n\nWe observed a defined launcher activity in the malicious app’s manifest file, extending the react-native class and\nloading the “index.Android.bundle” file from assets.\n\n_Figure 10 –_\n\n_Launcher Activity_\nOnce the application is installed, it asks the user to import the wallet using the seed phrase. The app does not accept\nrandom seed phrases. It has a predefined dictionary of words in the js script. If the seed phrase matches the pattern\nfrom the dictionary, it will send the seed phrase to the Command & Control (C&C) server.\n\n_Figure 11 – Malicious app asking for Seed Phrase_\n\nOn analyzing the index file’s JavaScript source code, the method “tryExportSeedPhrase()” is responsible for sending\nthe seed phrase to the malicious server hosted at “hxxp://39.109.123.213/handler[.]ashx“.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12 –_\n\n_Modified malicious JS code_\nDynamic analysis confirms that the application sends a seed phrase to the malicious server, as shown below.\n\n_Figure 13 –_\n\n_Sending seed phrase to the malicious server_\nThe seed phrase is used to access crypto wallets.\n\nTAs can thus use the harvested seed phrase to access the wallet and steal cryptocurrency, causing financial loss to\nvictims.\n\nSince the seed phrase is sent to the attacker’s server using an unsecured HTTP connection, other attackers who are\nmonitoring the victim’s outgoing network connection can also compromise the wallets.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to our research, the fake crypto wallet targets Metamask iOS and Android users. The fake wallet does not\nneed many Android permissions to steal seed phrases and cryptocurrency. However, the Threat Actor mimicked the\ngenuine Metamask website extremely closely, making it easier to trick potential victims.\n\nCrypto wallets must strengthen their mobile-first approach and prepare for the challenges posed by this threat by\nunderstanding the security landscape. This can be achieved by implementing a real-time threat-driven mobile security\nstrategy.\n\n## Our Recommendations\n\nWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against attackers. We\nrecommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:\n\n### How to prevent malware infection?\n\nDownload and install software only from official app stores like Google Play Store or the iOS App Store.\nUse a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices, such as PCs,\nlaptops, and mobile devices.\n\nUse strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.\nEnable biometric security features such as fingerprint or facial recognition for unlocking the mobile device where\npossible.\nBe wary of opening any links received via SMS or emails delivered to your phone.\nEnsure that Google Play Protect is enabled on Android devices.\nBe careful while enabling any permissions.\nKeep your devices, operating systems, and applications updated.\n\n### How to identify whether you are infected?\n\nRegularly check the Mobile/Wi-Fi data usage of applications installed on mobile devices.\nKeep an eye on the alerts provided by Anti-viruses and Android OS and take necessary actions accordingly.\n\n### What to do when you are infected?\n\nDisable Wi-Fi/Mobile data and remove SIM card – as in some cases, the malware can re-enable the Mobile\nData.\nPerform a factory reset.\nRemove the application in case a factory reset is not possible.\nTake a backup of personal media Files (excluding mobile applications) and perform a device reset.\n\n### What to do in case of any fraudulent transaction?\n\nIn case of a fraudulent transaction, immediately report it to the concerned bank.\n\n### What should banks do to protect their customers?\n\nBanks and other financial entities should educate customers on safeguarding themselves from malware attacks\nvia telephone, SMSs, or emails.\n\n## MITRE
