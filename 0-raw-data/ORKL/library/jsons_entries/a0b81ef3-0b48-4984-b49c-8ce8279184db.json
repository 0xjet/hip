    "plain_text": "# Cybercriminals cash in on black market vaccine schemes\n\n**[intel471.com/blog/fake-covid-vaccination-cards-cybercrime](https://intel471.com/blog/fake-covid-vaccination-cards-cybercrime)**\n\nIf you look back through all of the research Intel 471 has released on cybercriminals making\nmoney on stolen digital assets, a major takeaway is that the cyber underground will adopt\nany scheme, as long as it results in money being made. With the world trying to move past\nthe global COVID-19 pandemic, another opportunity for illegal gains has struck.\n\nIntel 471 has observed numerous actors on various underground forums selling fake COVID\nvaccine certifications, as well as several forums hosting advertisements for COVID-19\nvaccines. While these advertisements have proliferated for months, we have observed these\nschemes growing on underground forums that are rooted in the cybercrime ecosystem.\n\nOf those fake vaccine passes being advertised, we have seen the concentration placed on the\nUnited States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccination card, which is a\npaper form, and the European Union’s vaccine passport, which is issued in both digital and\npaper forms. On one particular cybercrime forum, an actor has listed several advertisements\nfor fake vaccination cards that parrots a lot of the misinformation that surround the various\nCOVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“We do this to help people who are in critical situations and want to travel urgently,” the\nadvertisement reads. “Watch out and stay away from the vaccine; it’s poisonous. Kindly pass\nout the message to those who are still blind out there, so many secrets are hidden from us.\nThe minority ruling are trying to destroy mankind.”\n\nThe actor has set up several communication channels for anyone interested: potential\ncustomers can reach out via encrypted messaging services Telegram, WhatsApp, and Wickr,\nor encrypted email service ProtonMail.\n\nAnother advertisement on the same forum offers fake CDC cards. These falsified documents\nare focused on the European and French documents and associated false QR codes. The\nwebsite, accessible via the TOR browser, shows what the final QR code product will look like:\n\n\n-----\n\nAn example of a fake French digital COVID passport taken from an underground website. (Intel 471)\n\nWith regards to the actual vaccine, an actor’s advertisement that Intel 471 observed claimed\nto be able to send potential buyers numerous different vaccines currently on the market:\nAstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, and Sputnik V. Buyers were then\ndirected to visit a particular website set up for sales. However, that e-commerce website was\nnot working at the time this blog post was published.\n\nThere have been numerous reports that this falsified document practice has been going on\nfor months. However, we have seen the market change as the virus causes different issues in\nvarious parts of the world. Actors will:\n\nRead open-source news to determine which countries are not getting enough, or any,\ndeliveries of the vaccine.\n\nMarket the illegal vaccine to these developing countries since these nations have no\nprivate way of obtaining vaccines and must instead rely on COVAX distribution.\n\nUndermine the pharmaceutical companies’ efforts to distribute the vaccine, putting\npeople in danger since they have very little recourse to determine if the vaccines are\nlegitimate.\n\n\n-----\n\nBe it underground vaccine sales or counterfeit vaccine passes, actors are monetizing the fear\nand misinformation around COVID-19, creating a new market that has been constructed\npartly by pushing people who have never purchased anything illicit to buy things off of the\nunderground. While the schemes carried out in this blog do not directly impact an\norganization’s cybersecurity defenses, it can hurt pharmaceutical companies by robbing them\nof consumers and damaging their brand reputations. In addition, fake vaccine passports\nharm healthcare, erodes government trust with false information, and can disrupt local and\nnational economies.\n\nNo matter the damage wrought, it shows that cybercriminals and the forums where they\ngather online will take on any scheme, no matter how technical, in order to make money.\n\n\n-----",
