    "plain_text": "# Vidar Exploiting Social Media Platform (Mastodon)\n\n**asec.ahnlab.com/en/30875/**\n\nJanuary 26, 2022\n\nThe ASEC analysis team has recently discovered that Vidar is exploiting a social media\nplatform named Mastodon to create C&C server addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\nMastodon website\nVidar is an info-stealer malware installed through spam emails and PUP, sometimes being\ndisguised as a KMSAuto authenticator tool. It has been consistently distributed since the\npast, and there was a recent case of it being installed through other types of malware such\nas Stop ransomware. When Vidar is run, it first accesses the C&C server to receive\ncommands and DLLs that are required to steal information before it can perform its infostealing activities. In the past, the malware simply connected to C&C server and received\ncommands and additional files like other malware. Yet the recent Vidar type exploits various\nonline platforms to actually create C&C servers.\n\nLast year, it used a game matching platform called FaceIt to do so, which was discussed in\none of the ASEC blog posts.\n\n[Vidar Info-Stealer Abusing Certain Game Platform](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/22932/)\n\nRecent Vidar cases exploit Mastodon, a social media platform. When Vidar is run, it first\naccesses Mastodon (noc.social website) before it tries to communicate with the C&C server.\nTo be more specific, it is a profile page of a user named “banda5ker”.\n\n\n-----\n\nAttacker’s Mastodon profile\nThe profile page has the string shown below. It is the actual C&C server address of Vidar.\n\n“hello 162.55.213[.]180|”\n\nThe malware downloads the web page and searches the “hello” string, parsing the C&C\naddress existing between the separator “|”.\n\nRoutine for C&C address parsing\nIf the attacker edits the profile part and enters another address, the Vidar info-stealer will\nconnect to the changed C&C server and continue to perform malicious activities. If\nMastodon’s attacker account is not blocked, the attacker can repeatedly edit the C&C server\nto make the same malware connect to different C&C servers. It is likely that the attacker is\nusing the method to bypass network detection for the C&C address.\n\n\n-----\n\nVidar connects to the actual C&C servers established and receives DLL files needed for\ncommands and info-stealing, and ultimately sends the stolen information to the C&C server.\nNote that Vidar’s version is v49.6 (see figure of data sent below). The version of the Vidar\nstrain which exploited FaceIt was v38.6.\n\nVidar’s network activities of sending stolen information\nThe info-stealing features of Vidar are explained in the following post.\n\n[Analysis of Info-Leaking Feature of Info-Stealer Malware Vidar](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/17633/)\n\nAhnLab’s anti-malware software, V3, detects and blocks the malware using the following\naliases:\n\n**[File Detection]**\n\n– Infostealer/Win.SmokeLoader.R465643 (2022.01.19.01)\n\n**[Behavior Detection]**\n\n– Malware/MDP.Vidar.M3505\n\n**[IOC]**\n\n**File**\n\n185cc9e866a23c5cff47d41e8834ffad\n\n**C&C**\n\n– hxxps://noc[.]social/@banda5ker\n\n– hxxp://162.55.213[.]180\n\n**Subscribe to AhnLab’s next-generation threat intelligence platform ‘AhnLab TIP’ to**\n**check related IOC and detailed analysis information.**\n\n[Categories:Malware Information](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/category/malware-information/)\n\n[Tagged as:C&C,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/cc-en/) [InfoStealer,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/infostealer-en/) [MASTADON,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/mastadon/) [vidar,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/vidar-en/) [VidarMASTODON](https://asec.ahnlab.com/tag/vidarmastodon/)\n\n\n-----",
