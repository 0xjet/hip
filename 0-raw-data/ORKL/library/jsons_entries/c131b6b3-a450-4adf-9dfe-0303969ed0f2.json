Today almost everyone knows that they\nneed to protect their publicly exposed services and applications against the potential attacks\nfrom the outside. Wide range of tools have been developed to provide protection\nmechanisms against such threats.\n\nWith more sophisticated security solutions being deployed, threat actors have shifted focus\non spots where the defense measures are the weakest or absent. Latest trends show that\nsoftware supply chain attacks have become a popular tactic for threat actors of all\nsophistication levels. They are now commonly aimed at the providers of low-level software\ncomponents as means to infiltrate development organizations, or even to subvert the release\nprocess.\n\nOne of the ways of doing this is by abusing the level of trust that developers have in the\nthird-party code. Growing popularity of software package repositories and their ease of use\nmake them a perfect target. When developers reuse existing libraries to implement the\nneeded functionality faster and easier, they rarely make in-depth security assessments\nbefore including them into their project. This omission is a result of the overwhelming nature,\nand the vast quantity, of potential security issues found in third-party code. Hence in general,\npackages are quickly installed to validate whether they solve the problem and, if they don’t,\nmove on to the alternative. This is a dangerous practice, and it can lead to incidental\ninstallation of malicious software.\n\nAs a part of our continuous security research, ReversingLabs periodically scans public\npackage repositories to track the malicious attempts to compromise software developers.\nThis blog discusses the process used to find another NPM package that steals saved\nChrome browser passwords.\n\n### NPM analysis\n\nNPM is the package manager for Node.js, hosting over 1.5 million unique packages and\nproviding over 30 billion monthly package downloads. The entire repository was processed\nusing ReversingLabs Titanium Platform static analysis engine. Following analysis shows\nthat, beside the expected textual JavaScript files, NPM also contains various types of\nexecutable files (PE, ELF, MachO…) within its packages. In this large scale NPM repository\nanalysis, the platform recursively extracted NPM packages, and then used Explainable\nMachine Learning algorithms to detect the embedded malware threats. One of its findings, a\nthreat labeled Win32.Infostealer.Heuristics, seemed as a promising lead. This detection was\nassigned to an embedded Windows executable file with the following SHA1 hash:\n881db33f855ab8e268d66c933689cdd32c40b694.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe aforementioned file was found in several versions of the nodejs_net_server package\nusing static analysis. Metadata collected from these packages shows that the original name\nof the file was “a.exe”, and that it was located inside the “lib” folder. While threat hunting, files\nwith filename consisting of a single letter and an extension immediately raise a red flag for\nadditional inspection. A detailed look into this particular case revealed that “a.exe” is, in-fact,\na [ChromePass utility, a tool which can be used to recover passwords stored inside of a](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chromepass.html)\nChrome web browser.\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot of ChromePass tool\n\nIt isn’t malicious by itself, but it can be when put into the malicious use context. For instance,\nthis package uses it to perform malicious password stealing and credential exfiltration. Even\nthough this off-the-shelf password recovery tool comes with a graphical user interface,\nmalware authors like to use it as it can also be run from the command line.\n\nThis might sound very familiar, as one of our [previous blog posts disclosed a similar](https://blog.secure.software/the-npm-package-that-walked-away-with-all-your-passwords)\npassword stealing PE executable found in another NPM package. It seems that true and\ntested techniques have a tendency to repeat themselves.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: nodejs_net_server NPM package summary\n\nNPM repository pages for the nodejs_net_server package show that the latest version of this\npackage, v1.1.2, was published 6 months ago. URL references for the package homepage\nand repository lead to non-existing locations hosted on GitHub. The author of this package\ngoes by the name chrunlee and seems to be an active developer on GitHub working on 61\nrepositories. GitHub account also contains a link to a web page hxxps://chrunlee.cn where\nthe author actively publishes blog posts related to developer thematics.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: chrunlee’s github profile\n\nNPM version history shows that this package has 12 published versions, totalling in over\n1,283 downloads since the package was first published at the end of February 2019. The\nanalysis that follows details the evolution process of this malicious NPM package.\n\n**Version number** **Publish date**\n\n1.0.0 2019-02-28 11:26:39\n\n1.0.1 2019-05-14 11:53:36\n\n1.0.2 2019-05-14 13:35:22\n\n1.0.3 2019-05-14 13:42:47\n\n\n-----\n\n1.0.4 2019-05-14 14:05:24\n\n1.0.5 2019-05-17 06:04:14\n\n1.0.6 2019-05-20 11:14:03\n\n1.0.7 2020-04-27 09:11:48\n\n1.0.8 2020-04-28 08:27:00\n\n1.1.0 2020-12-02 08:18:38\n\n1.1.1 2020-12-24 05:43:45\n\n1.1.2 2020-12-24 06:00:28\n\nTable 1: nodejs_net_server version history\n\nThe first version was published just to test the publishing process of an NPM package. Three\nmonths later, the developer implemented a remote shell functionality which was polished\nover several subsequent versions. In April 2020, minor modifications to the shell functionality\nwere made in the versions 1.0.7 and 1.0.8. Finally, in December 2020, the author made an\nupgrade to version 1.1.0 by adding a script to download the aforementioned password\nstealing tool hosted on their personal website, with the URL location\n_hxxps://chrunlee.cn/a.exe. In versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.2, this script was modified to run_\nTeamViewer.exe instead, probably because the author didn’t want to have such an obvious\nconnection between the malware and their website.\n\nFun fact related to versions that contain the password recovery tool is that the package\nauthor accidentally published their own, stored login credentials. It appears that the\npublished versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 from the NPM repository include the results of testing the\nChromePass tool on the author’s personal computer. These login credentials were stored in\nthe “a.txt” file located in the same folder as the password recovery tool named “a.exe”.\n\nThis textual file contains 282 login credentials created between March 20th 2020 and\nDecember 2nd 2020. There is a possibility that at least a part of these passwords are still\nvalid. While their validity wasn’t verified, just looking at some of the recovered credentials\nvisible in Figure 4. shows that the author didn’t always care about best password policy\npractices.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: some of the passwords malware author recovered from his browser\n\nAnother interesting fact is the way the author intended to trick the targets to execute the\nmalicious package. In cases of malware placed in package repositories, attackers usually\nrely on typosquatting. They disguise their packages by using names similar to some other\npopular package so that they could easily lure their targets into installing the package. In this\ncase, the author took a different approach and decided to abuse the configuration options of\nNPM packages.\n\nNPM packages provide a way to install one or more executable files into the PATH by\n[providing a “bin” field inside the package.json configuration file. Upon package installation,](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#bin)\nNPM will symlink that file to the prefix/bin folder for global installs, or ./node_modules/.bin/\nfolder for local installs. Any name can be assigned to these executables and, in case when a\nmodule with the same name already exists, it would be overwritten and mapped to the script\nprovided by the malware. Even though NPM requires the “--force” flag for this to work in case\nof global installs, it isn’t necessary for local package installations.\n\nIn this case, the hijacking target was the jstest package. NPM download stats show that this\npackage has been downloaded more than 35,000 times. It is a fairly popular package in the\nNode.js developer community, with more than 1,000 downloads in the last 7 days. What\nmakes this package a really good target for hijacking is that the preferred way to use it in\ntesting is executing it from the command line, instead of using it from JavaScript files as a\nmodule.\n\nFigure 5: Abusing “bin” field inside\n\npackage.json for execution hijacking\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the package installation and the successful execution hijacking, persistence is\naccomplished by installing the lib/test.js script as a Windows service.\n\nFigure 6: Installation of persistent windows service\n\nThis service opens a socket for listening to incoming commands on port 7353. Supported\ncommands include reverse host and port configuration, directory content listing, file lookup,\nfile upload, shell command execution and screen and camera recording. Screen and camera\nrecording are accomplished using the embedded ffmpeg executable. Browser password\nstealing is accomplished through shell command execution of the previously downloaded\nChromePass hack-tool.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Creation of the listening socket\n\nAs noted earlier, homepage and GitHub repository links of this package lead to non-existing\nwebpages. Looking at the other NPM packages published by the author chrunlee reveals\nanother package with non-existing links. This package is named tempdownloadtempfile, and\nhas only one version published June 17th 2019. It contains only the package.json and\n_file/test.js files. While the file/test.js file implements the same remote shell functionality as the_\nones found in different versions of nodejs_net_server package, this package does not\nperform execution hijacking and does not have a persistence mechanism, which makes its\npurpose a bit unclear.\n\n### Software supply chain attacks ramp up\n\nSoftware supply chain attacks are becoming a powerful strategy for malicious actors.\nSecurity community needs to pay more attention to these types of threats. Everyone involved\nin the software development process needs to understand that malicious actors today are\ntrying to compromise the development process across all of its stages. Developers are being\ntargeted as a critical entry point to their organization and its client base.\n\nOne of the most frequent attack vectors targeting developers is exploitation of public\npackage repositories. As these repositories have a large number of hosted packages, they\noffer a good hiding place for malware to lurk in. Repetitive discovery of malicious packages in\nthese repositories has proven that there is a growing need for security solutions that can\nprovide reliable identification and protection against these types of attacks.\n\nReversingLabs is continuously developing and improving tools that can be incorporated into\nthe software development process to provide a reliable and efficient detection of software\nsupply chain attacks. Its powerful static analysis engine can generate a software security\nreport which provides an exact and complete insight into the contents of a release package\n\n\n-----\n\nin the form of a Software Bill Of Materials, or SBOM. The report provides information on\npossible unknown or unexpected software dependencies, and unwanted licencing\nrestrictions found in third-party software. In addition to in-depth malware identification, it also\nprovides an early warning about leaked sensitive information like private SSH keys and\ncertificates. With powerful software behavior diffs, released packages can also be compared\nto their previous versions to observe and recognize possibly unwanted changes in code\nfunctionality. Every detected problem is scored with a grade describing its severity,\nremediation complexity, and offers a recommendation towards problem resolution.\n\nThe ReversingLabs software quality assurance report enables critical security improvement\ntracking during the software development process. This report is specifically designed for\ndevelopers looking to take that next step in implementing best practices needed to produce\nquality and secure software.
