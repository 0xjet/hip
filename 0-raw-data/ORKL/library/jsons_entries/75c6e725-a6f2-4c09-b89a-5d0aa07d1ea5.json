ShadowPad was the primary\nbackdoor for espionage operations in multiple campaigns, including the CCleaner,\nNetSarang, and ASUS supply-chain attacks.\nThe adoption of ShadowPad significantly reduces the costs of development and\nmaintenance for threat actors. We observed that some threat groups stopped\ndeveloping their own backdoors after they gained access to ShadowPad.\nAs a byproduct of that shared tooling, any claim on attribution needs to be reviewed in\na cautious way when a shared backdoor like ShadowPad is involved.\nInstead of focusing on specific threat groups, we discuss local personas possibly\ninvolved in the development of ShadowPad as an iterative successor to PlugX.\n\n\n-----\n\nRead the Full Report\n\n## Overview\n\nShadowPad emerged in 2015 as the successor to PlugX. However, it was not until several\n[infamous supply-chain incidents occurred – CCleaner,](https://blog.avast.com/new-investigations-in-ccleaner-incident-point-to-a-possible-third-stage-that-had-keylogger-capacities) [NetSarang and](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/) [ShadowHammer –](https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer-a-high-profile-supply-chain-attack/90380/)\nthat it started to receive widespread attention in the public domain. Unlike the publicly-sold\nPlugX, ShadowPad is privately shared among a limited set of users. Whilst collecting IoCs\nand connecting the dots, we asked ourselves: What threat actors are using ShadowPad in\ntheir operations? And ultimately, how does the emergence of ShadowPad impact the wider\nthreat landscape from Chinese espionage actors?\n\nTo answer those questions, we conducted a comprehensive study on the origin, usage and\necosystem of ShadowPad. The full report provides:\n\na detailed overview of ShadowPad, including its history, technical details, and our\nassessment of its business model and ecosystem\na detailed description of four activity clusters where ShadowPad has been used\na discussion of how ShadowPad’s emergence changes the attacking strategies of\nsome China-based threat actors\nhow ShadowPad affects the threat landscape of Chinese espionage attacks\n\nIn this blog post, we provide an abridged version of some of our key findings and\ndiscussions. Please see the full report for an extended discussion, full Indicators of\nCompromise and other technical indicators.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nShadowPad is a modular backdoor in shellcode format. On execution, a layer of an\nobfuscated shellcode loader is responsible for decrypting and loading a Root plugin. While\nthe sequence of operation in the Root plugin decrypts, it loads other plugins embedded in the\nshellcode into memory. The plugins are kept and referenced through a linked list:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nstruct plugin_node {\n  plugin_node* previous_node;\n  plugin_node* next_node;\n  DWORD referenced_count;\n  DWORD plugin_timestamp;\n  DWORD plugin_id;\n  DWORD field_0;\n  DWORD field_1;\n  DWORD field_2;\n  DWORD field_3;\n  DWORD plugin_size;\n  LPVOID plugin_base_addr;\n  LPVOID plugin_export_function_table_addr;\n}\n\n```\nAlong with the plugins embedded in the sample, additional plugins are allowed to be\nremotely uploaded from the C&C server, which allows users to dynamically add\nfunctionalities not included by default.\n\nThe architecture of ShadowPad backdoor\nAs luck would have it, the ShadowPad controller (version 1.0, 2015) was accidentally\ndiscovered during private research. All of the stakeholders involved agreed to our releasing\nscreenshots but not the details of the actual file, so we are unable to provide hashes for this\ncomponent at present.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis of the controller allowed us to obtain a clear picture of how the builder generates the\nshellcodes, how the users manage the infected hosts, and the kinds of functions available on\nthe controller.\n\n## Privately Shared Attack Framework or Privately Sold Modular Malware?\n\nAn intriguing question to address is whether ShadowPad is a privately shared attack\nframework or a privately developed modular malware platform for sale to specific groups. Its\ndesign allows the users to remotely deploy new plugins to a backdoor. In theory, anyone\ncapable of producing a plugin that is encrypted and compressed in the correct format can\nadd new functionalities to the backdoor freely.\n\nHowever, the control interfaces of the plugins are hardcoded in the “Manager” page of the\nShadowPad controller, and the controller itself does not include a feature to add a new\ncontrol interface.\n\nThe interfaces to control the plugins are hardcoded and listed in the “Manager” page\nIn other words, it is unlikely that ShadowPad was created as a collaborative attacking\nframework. Only the plugins produced by the original developer could be included and used\nthrough the ShadowPad controller.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the other hand, even if the control interface of a plugin is listed in the menu, not every\navailable plugin is embedded in the ShadowPad samples built by the controller by default.\nThere is no configuration in the builder to allow the user to choose which plugins are\ncompiled into the generated sample, so this setting can only be managed by the developer of\nthe controller.\n\nIf ShadowPad was not originally designed as an open framework, the following question is\nwhether it is freely shared with or sold to its users. The possible author ‘whg’ – and one of his\nclose affiliates, Rose – have been monetizing their malware development and hacking skills\n[since the early 2000s. Both individuals sold self-developed malware, and Rose offered](https://web.archive.org/web/20090925075518/http:/www.hackbase.com:80/news/2009-04-09/24948.html)\nservices such as software cracking, penetration testing and DDoS attacks. If ShadowPad\nwas developed by them or their close affiliates, it is more likely to be sold to – rather than\nfreely shared with – other users under this context.\n\n## Selling the Plugins Separately Rather than Giving a Full Bundle by Default\n\nThe available functionalities to ShadowPad users are highly controlled by the seller of\nShadowPad. Looking deeply into the plugin numbers and the distribution of different plugins\nembedded in around a hundred samples, we assessed that the seller is likely selling each\nplugin separately instead of offering a full bundle with all of the currently available plugins.\n\nThe number of samples grouped by the number of plugins in each sample\nThe image above groups the samples by the number of the plugins embedded in them. Most\nof the samples contain less than nine plugins with the following plugins embedded: Root,\nPlugins, Config, Install, Online, TCP, HTTP, UDP and DNS. This set of plugins can only\n\n\n-----\n\nsupport the installation of backdoors and communications with C&C servers, without\nproviding further functionality.\n\n## What Threat Actors Are Using Shadowpad?\n\nShadowPad is sold privately to a limited set of customers. SentinelOne has identified at least\nfive activity clusters of ShadowPad users since 2017:\n\nAPT41\nTick & Tonto Team\nOperation Redbonus\nOperation Redkanku\nFishmonger\n\nIn the full report, we discuss each in turn. Here, we will limit our observations to the most\ninteresting points related to APT41.\n\nAPT41 is the [accepted naming convention for the activities conducted by two spinoffs of](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer)\nwhat was once referred to as ‘Winnti’, sub-groups – BARIUM (Tan Dailin aka Rose and\nZhang Haoran) and LEAD (Chengdu 404 Network Technology Co., Ltd).\n\nAll of the individuals are based in Chengdu, Sichuan. Rose (aka “凋凌玫瑰”), Zhang Haoran,\nand Jiang Lizhi (aka “BlackFox”, one of the persons behind Chengdu 404) were coworkers\n[between 2011 and 2017, while Rose and BlackFox knew each other since at least 2006.](https://web.archive.org/web/20060906223841/http:/www.mghacker.com:80/blogview.asp?logID=127)\n\nRose started his active collaboration on malware development with whg, the author of PlugX,\n[when he was a member of the hacking group NCPH back in 2005. They developed “NCPH](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/WickedRose_andNCPH.pdf)\nRemote Control Software” together until 2007. The executable of the controller was freely\n[shared on NCPH websites, but they also declared that the source code was for sale.](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519130046if_/http://www.ncph.net/newncph/news_view.asp?newsid=96)\n\n\n-----\n\nNCPH 5.0 Remote Control Software, developed back in 2005, was powered by whg and\nRose\n\nRose and his friends sold the source code of “NCPH remote control software” on NCPH\nforum\n\n\n-----\n\nBARIUM (Rose and Zhang Haoran) were one of the earliest threat groups with access to\n[ShadowPad. Aside from some smaller-scale attacks against the gaming industry, they were](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/03/11/gaming-industry-scope-attackers-asia/)\naccountable for several supply chain attacks from 2017 to 2018. Some of their victims\n[included NetSarang,](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/) [ASUS, and allegedly,](https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer-a-high-profile-supply-chain-attack/90380/) [CCleaner.](https://content.fireeye.com/apt-41/rpt-apt41/)\n\nAnother subgroup, LEAD, also used ShadowPad along with other backdoors to attack\nvictims for both financial and espionage purposes. They were reported to attack electronic\nproviders and consumers, universities, telecommunication, NGO and foreign governments.\n\nConsidering the long-term affiliation relationship between Rose and whg, we suspect that\nRose likely had high privilege access to – or was a co-developer of – ShadowPad, and other\nclose affiliates in Chengdu were likely sharing resources. This could also explain why\nBARIUM was able to utilize a special version of ShadowPad in some of their attacks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe emergence of ShadowPad, a privately sold, well-developed and functional backdoor,\noffers threat actors a good opportunity to move away from self-developed backdoors. While it\nis well-designed and highly likely to be produced by an experienced malware developer, both\nits functionalities and its anti-forensics capabilities are under active development. For these\nthreat actors, using ShadowPad as the primary backdoor significantly reduces the costs of\ndevelopment.\n\nFor security researchers and analysts tracking China-based threat actors, the adoption of the\n“sold – or cracked – commercial backdoor” raises difficulties in ascertaining which threat\nactor they are investigating. More systematic ways – for instance, analysis on the\nrelationship between indicators, long-term monitoring on the activities and campaigns – need\nto be developed in order to carry out analytically-sound attribution. Any claim made publicly\non the attribution of ShadowPad users requires careful validation and strong evidentiary\nsupport so that it can help the community’s effort in identifying Chinese espionage.\n\nRead the full report for an extended discussion, full Indicators of Compromise and other\ntechnical indicators.\n\n## Read the Full Report\n\n[Read the Full Report](https://assets.sentinelone.com/c/Shadowpad?x=P42eqA)\n\n\n-----",
