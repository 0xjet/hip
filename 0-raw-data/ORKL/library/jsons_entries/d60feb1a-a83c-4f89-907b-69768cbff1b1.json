This information represents victims who_\n_were successfully attacked but opted not to pay a ransom._\n\nIt seems like LockBit wasn’t content with having us merely crown them as one of the five\nmost serious cyberthreats facing businesses in 2023. In February, the most widely used\nransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) posted a total of 126 victims on its leak site—a record high\nsince we started tracking the leaks in February 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\nKnown ransomware attacks by gang, February 2023\n\n\n-----\n\nKnown ransomware attacks by country, February 2023\n\n\n-----\n\nKnown ransomware attacks by industry sector, February 2023\nCompanies attacked along LockBit’s warpath last month include financial software firm ION\nGroup and Pierce Transit, a public transit operator in Washington state. LockBit claimed that\n[ION Group had paid the ransom and demanded $2 million from Pierce Transit.](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/02/ion-starts-bringing-customers-back-online-after-lockbit-ransomware-attack)\n\nSpeaking of ransom demands, it seems like that’s another area where LockBit broke records\nlast month.\n\nIn early February LockBit tried to get $80 million out of the UK's Royal Mail—the largest\ndemand since asking Continental for $50 million in 2022. Royal Mail rejected the demand,\ncalling it ‘absurd’, and LockBit consequently published the files it stole from the company—\n[but not without also leaking a chat history showing the negotiations between the two parties,](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/02/royal-mail-gives-lockbit-a-lesson-in-ransomware-negotiation)\nwhich featured the unusual sight of a Royal Mail negotiator giving the feared ransomware\ngang the runaround.\n\n\n-----\n\nLockbit and Royal Mail negotiations\nConfirmed attacks by Vice Society, the ransomware gang infamous for wreaking havoc on\nthe education sector, reached their three-month low last month. The apparently Russianbased group tallied just two victims on its leak site in February, but—true to their modus\noperandi—both of them were educational institutions: Guildford County School, a specialist\nmusic academy in London, and Mount Saint Mary College, a liberal arts college in New York.\nNeedless to say, we’re not banking on this persistent education sector threat going away\nanytime soon.\n\nAfter LockBit, ALPHV (aka BlackCat) and Royal again topped the list of most known victims\nlast month. But as it turns out, these two groups have more in common than just their high\nplacements: Both are considered big dangers to healthcare organizations. The US\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) even released a detailed report on Royal\nand ALPHV in mid-January 2023 outlining the dual threat to the US health sector. Last\nmonth, however, Royal and ALPHV apparently only attacked one healthcare organization\n[between them—ALPHV’s attack on the Pennsylvania-based Lehigh Valley Health Network.](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/02/lehigh-valley-health-network-targeted-by-blackcat-ransomware)\nTheir combined 48 leaked victims last month were across a range of industries, mainly\ncentered around manufacturing, logistics, and services. It just goes to show that just because\nransomware is used to target one sector in one month that doesn’t necessarily mean it won’t\nbe used against a different industry in another month.\n\n[Ever since we first reported on it in November 2022, witnessing the emergence of the Play](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/01/ransomware-in-november-2022)\nransomware gang over the months has been one of those “Aw, they grow up so fast (and\nevil)” type of situations. After their surge in December activity fell by about 76 percent in\nJanuary, it made something of a comeback last month with 11 known victims, including the\nCity of Oakland, where an attack shutdown many of the city's services. In fact, the situation\nwas so bad in Oakland that the Interim City Administrator declared a state of emergency\nshortly afterwards.\n\n## New ransomware groups\n\n### Medusa\n\n\n-----\n\nNot since we introduced Royal ransomware in November 2022 have we seen a new gang\nburst onto the scene with as much activity as Medusa did in February. The group published\n20 victims on its leak site, making it the third most active ransomware last month. Among its\nvictims are Tonga Communications Corporation (TCC), a state-owned telecommunications\ncompany, and oil and gas regulator company PetroChina Indonesia.\n\nThe Medusa leak site\n\n### V is Vendetta\n\nV is Vendetta is a newcomer that published three victims in February on a site that follows\nthe not-so-new practice of branding itself with imagery ripped from a particular mid-2000s\ndystopian action film. The site is noteworthy not only for its awful \"teenager's bedroom\"\n\n\n-----\n\ndesign but also for using a subdomain of the Cuba ransomware dark web site.\n\nThe V is Vendetta leak site\n\n## DPRK's ransomware antics\n\n[In early February, CISA released an alert highlighting the continuous state-sponsored](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/02/cisa-issues-alert-with-south-korean-government-about-dprks-ransomware-antics)\nransomware activities by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) against\norganizations in the US healthcare sector and other vital infrastructure sectors.\n\nThe agencies have reason to believe cryptocurrency ransom payments from such operations\nsupport DPRK's \"national-level priorities and objectives.\" The report states:\n\nThe authoring agencies assess that an unspecified amount of revenue from these\ncryptocurrency operations supports DPRK national-level priorities and objectives,\nincluding cyber operations targeting the United States and South Korea governments\n—specific targets include Department of Defense Information Networks and Defense\nIndustrial Base member networks,\n\nIn the last few years, two new ransomware strains from DPRK have surfaced: Maui and\nH0lyGh0st.\n\n## US Marshal Service ransomware attack\n\nIt seems ransomware attackers are going after the big fish again.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt least, it s been a while since a federal agency like the US Marshals Service (USMS) was\n[hit with ransomware. In late February 2023 a threat actor managed to infiltrate the agency](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/02/us-marshals-service-hit-by-ransomware-and-data-breach)\nand to get hold of sensitive information about staff and fugitives.\n\nIt’s far from rare to see a ransomware attack on governments, to be sure. State, Local,\nTribal, and Territorial (SLTT) governments were hammered by ransomware throughout 2022.\nAttacks on the federal government, however, remain few and far between.\n\nIf there’s one thing this attack taught us, it’s that no organization is safe from ransomware—\nbut that’s not all. It’s also the most eye-catching attack on the fabric of the US since the\n[Colonial Pipeline attack by the DarkSide ransomware gang. There is no word about who is](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/05/ransomware-attack-shuts-down-colonial-pipeline-fuel-supply)\nresponsible for the attack or whether or not there has been a ransom demand.\n\nIf this is the work of a regular ransomware gang rather than a political statement, it's a\nsurprise that they're this bold (or frankly, stupid, for thinking the federal government would\never pay them). Attacking a federal government paints a huge target on their backs.\n\n[We know there have been times where affiliates of ransomware gangs go rogue and attack](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/02/ransomware-in-december-2022#:~:text=Lockbit%E2%80%A6%20apologizes%3F)\nan organization that's off-limits according to the gangs' rules—but until more information is\nreleased, many details about the USMS breach remain speculative.\n\nOur Ransomware Emergency Kit contains the information you need to defend against\nransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) gangs.\n\n[GET THE RANSOMWARE EMERGENCY KIT](https://try.malwarebytes.com/2023-ransomware-emergency-kit/)\n\nHow to avoid ransomware\n\n**[Block common forms of entry.
