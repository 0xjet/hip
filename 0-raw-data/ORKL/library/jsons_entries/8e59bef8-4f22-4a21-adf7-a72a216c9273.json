Dmytro Fedorov, 44, Fedir Hladyr, 33,\nand Andrii Kopakov, 30, are suspected to be key members within CARBON SPIDER’s point\nof sale (POS) subgroup.\n\nThe arrests took place between January and June 2018, and coincided with a slowdown in\nCARBON SPIDER activity. The [DoJ announcement also details the group’s use of a front](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-members-notorious-international-cybercrime-group-fin7-custody-role-attacking-over-100)\ncompany, named Combi Security, to recruit developers and intrusion specialists for its\noperations. Given that other members of this subgroup remain at large, it is likely that the\ntactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) may change but activity will continue.\n\nCARBON SPIDER, more widely known as the Carbanak group, is a long-standing criminal\nenterprise responsible for compromising banks to transfer funds to mule accounts,\nperforming ATM jackpotting attacks, and conducting mass compromise of debit and credit\ncards from POS terminals in large enterprises. They have been active in some form since at\n\n\n-----\n\nleast 2013. During that time, the group has focused on the banking, financial, media,\ntechnology, hospitality, and food and beverage verticals, using targeted campaigns to reach\ntheir objectives.\n\n## Untangling the CARBON SPIDER Web\n\nThe structure of CARBON SPIDER is very complex and was initially suspected to be a\nsingle group, based on their use of several custom tools and specific TTPs. However,\nfurther research into the structure indicates that there are several clusters of activity likely\nmade up of subgroups serving different missions, potentially with access to a shared\ndevelopment environment and pool of resources. A complex structure such as this is\ndifficult to manage and speaks to the sophistication of the actor.\n\nThis blog aims to examine CARBON SPIDER over time and attempts to describe their\n[changing relationship within the eCrime ecosystem.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/ecrime-ecosystem/)\n\n## Custom Tools\n\nCARBON SPIDER has leveraged many custom tools since it began activity in 2013,\nincluding its primary implant Sekur (a.k.a. Anunak). These include the following:\n\n**Sekur**\n\nName Sekur\n\nAliases Anunak and Carbanak RAT\n\nFirst Seen February 2014 (based on compile time)\n\nLast Seen November 2017 (based on compile time)\n\nPurpose Primary remote access toolkit (RAT) for monitoring victim systems of interest\n\nType Microsoft Windows executable\n\n\nExample\nHash\n\nFalcon\nEPP\nprotection\n\n\n[f70cef297efe9ec0abea369b3c1235f14220a6165b48f6e8aa054296078122c8](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/f70cef297efe9ec0abea369b3c1235f14220a6165b48f6e8aa054296078122c8)\n\n[Machine learning: Cloud-based, on-sensor indicators of attack(IOAs):](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/indicators-attack-vs-indicators-compromise/)\nSuspicious activity\n\n\n-----\n\nMITRE\nATT&CK™\ntechnique\nanalysis\nfrom\nHybrid\nAnalysis\n\nSekur has been CARBON SPIDER’s primary tool for several years, although usage over\nthe last year appears to have declined. It contains all the functionality you would expect\nfrom a RAT, allowing the adversary to execute commands, manage the file system, manage\nprocesses, and collect data. In addition, it can record videos of victim sessions, log\nkeystrokes, enable remote desktop, or install Ammyy Admin or VNC modules. From July\n2014 on, samples were compiled with the capability to target Epicor POS systems and to\ncollect credit card data.\n\n**Agent ORM**\n\nName Agent ORM\n\nAliases Toshliph and DRIFTPIN\n\nFirst Seen June 2015 (based on compile time)\n\nLast Seen May 2016 (based on compile time)\n\nPurpose First-stage information collection and downloading next-stage payloads\n\nType Microsoft Windows executable\n\n\nExample\nHash\n\nFalcon\nEPP\nprotection\n\nMITRE\nATT&CK™\ntechnique\nanalysis\nfrom\nHybrid\nAnalysis\n\n\n[36937e5e744873b3646c9d345e8cf50fb969029dc77525acfe63d5a9d28b73f2](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/36937e5e744873b3646c9d345e8cf50fb969029dc77525acfe63d5a9d28b73f2)\n\n[Machine learning: Cloud-based, on-sensor IOAs: Suspicious activity](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/indicators-attack-vs-indicators-compromise/)\n\n\n_Agent ORM began circulating alongside Sekur in campaigns throughout the second half of_\n2015. The malware collects basic system information and is able to take screenshots of\nvictim systems. It is used to download next-stage payloads when systems of interest are\n\n\n-----\n\nidentified. It is strongly suspected that Agent ORM has been deprecated in favor of scriptbased first-stage implants (VB Flash, JS Flash, and Bateleur).\n\n**VB Flash**\n\nName VB Flash\n\nAliases HALFBAKED\n\n\nFirst\nSeen\n\nLast\nSeen\n\n\nSeptember 2015 (based on observed distribution)\n\nMay 2017 (based on observed distribution)\n\n\nPurpose First-stage information collection and downloading next-stage payloads\n\nType VBScript\n\n\nExample\nHash\n\nFalcon\nEPP\nprotection\n\n\n[a7a927bd44040817ae39e15aeb3f0b69ca943d4ce5b00d12eed6fae5b1c325d0](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/a7a927bd44040817ae39e15aeb3f0b69ca943d4ce5b00d12eed6fae5b1c325d0)\n\n[IOAs: Attacker methodology; Suspicious activity](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/indicators-attack-vs-indicators-compromise/)\n\n\nVB Flash was first observed being deployed alongside Agent ORM in September 2015. It is\nlikely that this was developed as a replacement to Agent ORM and contained similar\ncapabilities. The first observed instance of VB Flash included comments and was easy to\nanalyze—later versions soon began to integrate multiple layers of obfuscation. Several\nversions of VB Flash were developed including ones that utilized Google Forms, Google\nMacros, and Google Spreadsheets together to make a command-and-control (C2) channel.\nThis variant would POST victim data to a specified Google form, then make a request to a\nGoogle macro script, receiving an address for a Google Spreadsheet from which to request\ncommands.\n\n**JS Flash**\n\nName JS Flash\n\nAliases JavaScript variant of HALFBAKED\n\nFirst Seen May 2017 (based on observed distribution)\n\nLast Seen November 2017 (based on observed distribution)\n\nPurpose First-stage information collection and downloading next-stage payloads\n\n\n-----\n\nType JavaScript\n\n\nExample\nHash\n\nFalcon EPP\nprotection\n\n\n[ffebcc4d2e851baecd89bf11103e3c9de86f428fdeaf0f8b33d9ea6f5ef56685](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/ffebcc4d2e851baecd89bf11103e3c9de86f428fdeaf0f8b33d9ea6f5ef56685)\n\n[IOAs: Attacker methodology; Suspicious activity](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/indicators-attack-vs-indicators-compromise/)\n\n\nJS Flash capabilities closely resemble those of VB Flash and leverage interesting\ntechniques in deployment via batch scripts embedded as OLE objects in malicious\ndocuments. Many iterations of JS Flash were observed being tested before deployment,\ncontaining minor changes to obfuscation and more complex additions, such as the ability to\ndownload TinyMet (a cutdown of the Metasploit Meterpreter payload). PowerShell was also\nused heavily for the execution of commands and arbitrary script execution. No JS Flash\nsamples were observed being deployed after November 2017.\n\n**Bateleur**\n\nName Bateleur\n\nAliases N/A\n\nFirst Seen June 2017 (based on observed distribution)\n\nLast Seen April 2018 (based on observed distribution)\n\nPurpose First-stage information collection and downloading next-stage payloads\n\nType JavaScript\n\n\nExample\nHash\n\nFalcon\n\nEPP\nprotection\n\nMITRE\nATT&CK™\ntechnique\nanalysis\nfrom\nHybrid\nAnalysis\n\n\n[da70df51aa80414fcba9bf7322e44e8ea5ed6a3725f342cd05c733376c6f2121](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/da70df51aa80414fcba9bf7322e44e8ea5ed6a3725f342cd05c733376c6f2121)\n\n[IOAs: Malicious document; Establishing persistence.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/indicators-attack-vs-indicators-compromise/)\n\n\nBateleur deployments began not long after JS Flash and were also written in JavaScript.\nDeployments were more infrequent and testing was not observed. It is likely that Bateleur\nwas run in parallel as an alternative tool and eventually replaced JS Flash as CARBON\n\n\n-----\n\nSPIDER s first stage tool of choice. Although much simpler in design than JS Flash, all\nexecuting out of a single script with more basic obfuscation, Bateleur has a wealth of\ncapabilities—including the ability to download arbitrary scripts and executables, deploy\nTinyMet, execute commands via PowerShell, deploy a credential stealer, and collect victim\nsystem information such as screenshots.\n\n## Clusters of Activity\n\nBased on the use of these tools, it is possible to group the CARBON SPIDER activity into\nseveral clusters. These clusters may represent different groups with a common tool supply\nchain, or isolated campaigns from the same group, using separate individuals to carry out\nattacks with a different focus.\n\n**Point of Sale (POS) Targeting**\n\n\nTarget\nRegion\n\nTarget\nSector\n\nActive\nFrom\n\n\nPrimarily U.S. and Western Europe\n\nEnterprises that process many card transactions (in particular casinos,\nhotels, and restaurant chains)\n\nAt least mid 2015\n\n\nActive To Current\n\nThe POS cluster is the most prolific associated to the CARBON SPIDER actor and is also\nknown as FIN7. This cluster has used all the custom tools described with VB Flash, JS\nFlash, and Bateleur that are unique to them. Over time, they have used targeted spear\nphishing emails to deploy malicious documents that initially used exploits; more recently,\nthey have used macros and OLE embedded objects. The primary method of cash out for\nthis group is the acquisition and sale of credit and debit card dumps from POS devices.\nMany of the stolen cards are sold as collectives on the eCrime marketplace, Joker’s Stash.\n\n**Targeting of Russian Financial Institutions**\n\nTarget Region Russia\n\nTarget Sector Financial and banking\n\nActive From Late 2013\n\nActive To Early 2015\n\n\n-----\n\nThis cluster can also be described as the original Carbanak group. It is suspected that they\nstole large sums of money using several cash out methods against Russian banks, at which\npoint the group may have diverged. It is likely that they developed the primary CARBON\nSPIDER implant Sekur and were, at the point of being operational, probably the only users\nof it.\n\n**Targeting of Middle Eastern Financial Institutions**\n\nTarget Region Middle East and South Asia\n\nTarget Sector Financial and banking\n\nActive From October 2014\n\nActive To Activity reported up to at least early 2016\n\nAlthough the targeting profile is the same as the Russian banking cluster, the TTPs are very\ndifferent. In particular, the use of tooling stands out from other clusters of CARBON SPIDER\nactivity. As with other clusters, the primary infection vector is targeted spear phishing emails\nthat use exploits for a variety of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office:\n\nCVE-2015-2545\nCVE-2014-4114\nCVE-2015-1770\nCVE-2015-1641\n\nA custom `.NET first stage payload is deployed that in some cases deploys Agent ORM or`\nSekur, but is also used to deploy NetWire. Instances of DarkComet and Morphine RAT use\nsome custom `.NET downloader servers as their C2. One possibility is that CARBON`\nSPIDER outsourced deployment of their malware for this campaign. An alternative theory is\nthat this is a seperate group also using CARBON SPIDER tools. Little is reported publicly\nabout the successfulness of this cluster of activity, and no cash out methods are known.\n\n**Targeting of Eastern European Financial Institutions**\n\nTarget Region Ukraine and Eastern Europe\n\nTarget Sector Likely financial and banking\n\nActive From Mid-2015\n\nActive To Last known activity in late 2015\n\nThe Eastern European banking cluster is based on a single campaign using a strategic web\ncompromise of an Italian bank in Ukraine to deploy instances of Agent ORM to likely\nUkrainian targets It is likely that this cluster links to one of the other clusters of Sekur\n\n\n-----\n\nactivity, possibly the unattributed activity discussed below. However, no follow-on actions\nhave been observed past Agent ORM deployment.\n\n**Unattributed**\n\n\nTarget\nRegion\n\nTarget\nSector\n\n\nWhere known (appears to be Ukraine)\n\nNot known in most cases (one case focused on news and media\norganizations)\n\n\nActive From May 2015\n\nActive To At least January 2017\n\nThe unattributed activity is based on a cluster of Sekur activity that runs in parallel with the\nPOS cluster of activity, but does not exhibit the same TTPs (with differences in Sekur\nconfiguration, campaigns, and infrastructure selection). Many of these samples were\nsubmitted from Ukraine; additionally, one of them was deployed using a malicious document\nwith a decoy that suggests Ukrainian news and media targeting. It is possible that this\nactivity relates to the Eastern European bank cluster of Agent ORM activity; yet without\nfurther evidence of follow-on activity, it is not possible to determine this cluster’s action on\nobjectives.\n\n## Timeline\n\nBelow is a timeline showing the activity of each of the five clusters of CARBON SPIDER\nactivity:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe timeline shows that several of these clusters of activity started just after public reporting\nof the group (around mid-2015) and that the divergence in activity may have been the result\nof this exposure. It also highlights that CARBON SPIDER now likely operates multiple\nparallel missions focusing on different regions and sectors.\n\n## Links to Other Targeted eCrime Groups\n\nBeyond the described clusters of CARBON SPIDER activity based around their custom\ntools, their are also interesting links to other tracked, targeted eCrime activity. This includes\nthe group dubbed RATPAK SPIDER (also known as Buhtrap) that targets Russian and\nUkrainian financial institutions, a group dubbed Odinaff targeting SWIFT systems\nparticularly in Eastern Europe, and the group COBALT SPIDER (also known as Cobalt)\nthat, again, specializes in targeting Russian banks.\n\n**RATPAK SPIDER**\n\nOperation Buhtrap had a similar target scope (Russian financial) to the first cluster of\nCARBON SPIDER activity. Although these have always been tracked as seperate groups,\nthere is a technical link between payload deployments. A custom macro dropper that would\nencode the payload using VB Script notation, and contained the strings “After OnTime” and\n“FUCK AV,” was observed in only 19 unique samples across Crowdstrike sample stores.\nOne of the payloads was an instance of Agent ORM used to targeted casinos; a second\npayload also used by CARBON SPIDER was an instance of Sekur. The other six unique\npayloads observed being deployed using this custom macro dropper were instances of the\nNullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) downloader attributed to the Buhtrap group.\nInitially, this led to tracking both threats as CARBON SPIDER. Although it now appears that\nBuhtrap is likely a separate entity, the use of this shared deployment mechanism — unique\nto these two groups — suggests a common supply chain or developer and a closer working\nrelationship, especially given some similarities in target scope.\n\n**Odinaff**\n\nA SWIFT compromise was observed in mid-2016, targeting a Ukrainian bank that at the\ntime was unattributed. Based on similar TTPs, it was hypothesised that this could be\nCARBON SPIDER activity; however, although common off-the-shelf tools (such as\nMeterpreter and Cobalt Strike) were used, the custom CARBON SPIDER arsenal was not\npresent. Later, this group was reported in open source as Odinaff. In addition to similar\nTTPs, there appeared to be some infrastructure overlap with two IP addresses. One Odinaff\nC2 was also reported to be in previous use as a Sekur plugin server. A second IP was also\nreported to be used by CARBON SPIDER in a previous campaign. Again, this may just be a\nshared hosting provider, but the TTP similarity makes this infrastructure overlap more\nnoteworthy.\n\n**COBALT SPIDER**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Cobalt group, tracked by CrowdStrike intelligence as COBALT SPIDER, bears many\nsimilarities in the targeting of banks to the Russian cluster of CARBON SPIDER activity.\nBoth groups also use Cobalt Strike and several other pen-testing tools in their operations;\nnevertheless, the two groups appear to be distinct outside of this.\n\nOn March 26, 2018, an announcement was made that a Russian citizen identified by\nauthorities as “Denis K.” was arrested by the Spanish national police in Alicante, Spain. He\nwas reportedly involved in early CARBON SPIDER targeting of Russian banks and is\nsuspected of being one of the members of COBALT SPIDER. Although reports suggest that\nhe may have been a leader of COBALT SPIDER, activity has continued from this group,\nsuggesting his role was not a key one within this organization. This suggests a link between\nthe two groups between 2013 and likely, 2015. This is around the time that the dominant\nfocus for CARBON SPIDER became targeting the POS systems of Western enterprises. It\nis possible that at least one individual left CARBON SPIDER and either joined forces with or\ncreated COBALT SPIDER.\n\n## Summary\n\nCARBON SPIDER is the pioneer of targeted eCrime activity with some of the largest\npublicly attributed success. Their level of sophistication across the clusters of activity makes\nthem a key player in the eCrime ecosystem. Although there is not enough evidence to\ndirectly link CARBON SPIDER to other targeted criminal groups, it is assessed with high\nconfidence (based on analysis of artifacts and infrastructure over time) that CARBON\nSPIDER shares resources with other notable criminal groups.\n\nThere are two possible hypotheses as to how the clusters of CARBON SPIDER activity are\nlinked. One theory is that they were originally one group that splintered into several with\ndifferent focuses. Several of the splinter groups may have maintained access to their\ncustom tools (e.g., Sekur), while others moved on to work with other actors (e.g., COBALT\nSPIDER). A second theory is that CARBON SPIDER operates as distinct groups with\ndifferent focuses, but they report to a single management structure. Resources may be\nshared between the groups, but each has its own members. At this stage, the first theory\nappears to be the most likely.\n\nBased on recently observed tooling and operations, CARBON SPIDER appears to be\nfocusing their efforts on the POS cluster of activity against the hospitality and restaurant\nsector, with no recently reported activity against banks. They also appear to be moving\naway from their custom tooling, with no Sekur samples compiled since November 2017 and\nfewer samples appearing in live operations.\n\nGoing forward, it is likely that CARBON SPIDER will continue operations to target sectors\nthat give the best financial return for their efforts. For the short term, this will likely mean a\ncontinued focus on POS systems and large enterprises that process them. It is possible that\nthey may return to target banks, but this would likely be on a small scale with very focused\n\n\n-----\n\noperations. CARBON SPIDER will likely move completely away from their old custom\ntoolset, either developing new tools or using commodity off-the-shelf packages to achieve\ntheir objectives. This is even more assured given the arrests of three members of the most\nprolific CARBON SPIDER subgroup.\n\nAs CARBON SPIDER adversary groups retool and alter their TTPs CrowdStrike will\n[continue to track this adversary leveraging FalconX capabilities to combine endpoint](https://www.crowdstrike.com/products/falcon-x/)\n[protection, automation and malware analysis to prevent CARBON SPIDER from breaching](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/malware-analysis/)\nour customer networks.\n\n_To learn more about how to incorporate intelligence on threat actors like CARBON SPIDER_\n_[into your security strategy, please visit the Falcon Intelligence product page.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/products/falcon-intelligence/)_\n\n_[Download the CrowdStrike 2020 Global Threat Report](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/2020-crowdstrike-global-threat-report/)_\n\nRelated Content\n\nWho is EMBER BEAR?\n\n\n-----\n\nA Tale of Two Cookies: How to Pwn2Own the Cisco RV340 Router\n\n\n-----\n\nPROPHET SPIDER Exploits Citrix ShareFile Remote Code Execution Vulnerability CVE 2021 22941 to\nDeliver Webshell\n\n\n-----",
