The plugin helps increase\nvisibility by displaying the reviews in strategic locations through advertising networks from\nGoogle or Microsoft.\n\nSecurity researchers from digital risk management company RiskIQ received an alert on\nSeptember 15 from their systems for positive identification of the Magecart skimming code\nin the certificate.js script of the Shopper Approved seal code.\n\nThe investigation revealed that the attackers injected the code without applying any\nobfuscation, which made it easy to detect and identify. Aware of the mistake, they returned\nabout 15 minutes later and modified the skimmer to hide it.\n\n\n-----\n\nDeobfuscated Magecart card-skimming script\nThis blunder, although minor, was enough to let researchers view the clean code without\nhaving to resort to deobfuscation techniques.\n\nObfuscated code, 15 minutes later\n\n\n-----\n\nOf note is the drop server set up by the attackers to receive the payment card data, which is\n[the same used in the Feedify hack, a month ago.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/feedify-hacked-with-magecart-information-stealing-script/)\n\nRiskIQ used several channels of communication to alert Shopper Approved of the\ncompromise and help them mitigate the issue. Two days later, the skimmer code was\nremoved from the store review widget. An investigation was also started to learn the source\nof the compromise.\n\n“While Shopper Approved is active on thousands of websites, only a small fraction of their\n[clients were impacted,” RiskIQ says in a report shared with BleepingComputer in advance.](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/magecart-shopper-approved/)\n\nShopper Approved identified clients that loaded the compromised script and contacted them\nto help remediate the issues.\n\n## At least seven groups associated with Magecart campaigns\n\nMagecart is the term used for multiple groups that either compromise shopping websites\ndirectly or go further up the stream and infect plugins used by a large number of online\nstores, in an attempt to score big.\n\nAt the moment, RiskIQ distinguishes between seven groups, some of them responsible for\nthe [Ticketmaster,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ticketmaster-announces-data-breach-affecting-5-percent-of-all-users/) [British Airways, Feedify, and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/british-airways-fell-victim-to-card-scraping-attack/) [Newegg breaches.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/newegg-credit-card-info-stolen-for-a-month-by-injected-magecart-script/)\n\nThe recommendation from the experts is to remove third-party code from checkout pages.\nMany payment service providers have already adopted this practice, RiskIQ informs.\n\n[The Magecart threat is unlikely to disappear any time soon. In fact, a sharp increase in the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/magecart-attacks-grow-rampant-in-september/)\nnumber of attacks has been spotted in September by multiple security outfits.\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
