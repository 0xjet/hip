He\nsaid Poland's Internal Security Agency and military intelligence established that the attacks\nwere by the UNC1151 group.\n\n“The services are in possession of information confirming the links of the aggressors with the\nactivity of the Russian special services,” Zaryn said in a statement.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome 100 of the more than 4,350 accounts hit in Poland belong to former and current\ngovernment members, lawmakers and local administration officials, Zaryn said.\n\nThe hacks include one revealed earlier this month on the private email and social media\naccounts of Michal Dworczyk, the head of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki’s office, and\nDworczyk’s wife.\n\nDworczyk insists his account held no classified or sensitive information.\n\nContent allegedly coming from Dworczyk's account and relating to armaments purchases\n[and Poland's response to the coronavirus, along with Dworczyk's ID and driving license, has](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/Coronavirus)\nappeared this month on the Telegram communicator that originated in Russia in 2013.\n\nProsecutors are investigating, and Zaryn said steps have been taken to increase\ncybersecurity. Last week, lawmakers met for a closed-doors session to analyze the attacks\nand draw lessons from them.\n\nPolish security officials often say the hacking of government-linked accounts is aimed at\nweakening Poland’s position internationally or straining its ties with Western partners. That is\nwidely seen in Poland as a strategic aim of the Kremlin as Warsaw backs sanctions against\n[Russia over its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its support for the authoritarian](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/Ukraine)\npresident of Belarus.\n\n\n-----",
