Key findings\n\n- **CryptBot continues to be deployed mainly from websites offering fake cracked software and “Pay-**\n\n**Per-Install” solutions like PrivateLoader (also known as “InstallsKey” on Telegram) or the now defunct**\n\n**360Installer.**\n\n- By searching for the **Matomo tracking script used by the threat actor to get web statistics**\n\nmeasurement on its campaigns, we were able to retrieve **every domain that hosted CryptBot**\n\nthroughout time and the ones currently hosting it. We also found that in some cases, those domains\n\nwere redirecting to **Lumma payloads loaded by** **HijackLoader depending on the URL the user was**\n\noriginating from.\n\n- Through the analysis of the websites offering infected versions of cracked software, we were able to\n\n**pivot on certain OPSEC errors made during their setup to find additional malicious websites with the**\n\nsame purpose of distributing CryptBot.\n\n- Both CryptBot and PrivateLoader continue to use bulletproof hosting solutions such as the infamous\n\n_“Aeza International Ltd” and “Karina Rashkovska” to host their phishing pages, command-and-control_\n\npanels, and malware payloads overall. We notably highlight how “Psb Hosting Ltd”, a company based\n\nin the United Kingdom and run by a Russian individual, now possesses an IPv4 range previously owned\n\nby _Karina Rashkovska, and how this company promotes its bulletproof hosting capacities on_\n\nunderground forums.\n\n- The Amadey cluster hosted by the Seychellois autonomous system “1337TEAM LIMITED” that was first\n\nanalysed by Team Cymru’s threat research team in September 2022, continues its activities with the\n\nlatest version of the malware (version 4.41), to push additional payloads including CryptBot, Lumma,\n\n**Redline and Stealc.**\n\n# 2. Introduction\n\nFirst discovered in 2019, CryptBot is a 32-bit infostealer designed to exfiltrate various sensitive\n\ninformation from an infected system and eventually later sell them to other threat actors as initial\n\naccess vectors for more complex data breach campaigns. Its main spreading technique is based on\n\nthe distribution of infected cracked versions of commonly used software. In a lesser volume, CryptBot\n\nalso relies on other threat actors to expend its botnet of infected machines like for example the “Pay\n**Per-Install” service named “InstallKeys” still active on Telegram, that offers access to the machines**\n\nit infects through its personal malware named **PrivateLoader. In addition to this service, Mandiant**\n\ndiscovered in August 2024 that “PeakLight”, a memory-only dropper spreading through fake video\n\nfiles, was used to deploy CryptBot along other malwares such as LummaC2 and ShadowLadder[1].\n\n1 _[https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/peaklight-decoding-stealthy-memory-only-](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/peaklight-decoding-stealthy-memory-only-malware?hl=en)_\n_[malware?hl=en](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/peaklight-decoding-stealthy-memory-only-malware?hl=en)_\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\nRegarding other deployments of the malware, Mandiant assessed with moderate confidence in 2021\n\nthat the state-sponsored Russian intrusion set **APT29 used logs stolen by CryptBot operators to gain**\n\na foothold in the system of a targeted entity.[2] As CryptBot is designed to steal the user content of some\n\ninternet browsers including **Google Chrome,** _Google decided to file a complaint against fifteen_\n\nPakistani individuals believed to be running the malware’s “criminal enterprise”. Additionally, other\n\nsoftware owned by Google such as Google Earth Pro were part of the long list of programs infected\n\nwith CryptBot and advertised on these fake websites. In the complaint file provided by the Southern\n\nDistrict court of New York, Google also mentions that infected cracked software distribution alone had\n\nled to approximately **672,220** **CryptBot infections between 2022 and 2023.[3] This information was**\n\ncorroborated by _Prodaft in a tweet from August 2023, in which they mentioned that more than_ **17**\n\n**million unique devices worldwide had been infected by the malware in the last 5 years.[4] Following**\n\nthis complaint, the court decided to grant Google the right to take down current and future domains\n\ntied to the distribution of CryptBot. Google stated that decision would “slow new infections from\n\n_occurring and decelerate the growth of CryptBot”._\n\nThe numbers indeed crashed to **40,581 infections in 2023 according to** _Prodaft[5]. However, despite_\n\nthose actions, Intrinsec CTI team observed new domains registered in **September 2024 used as**\n\nCryptBot C2s, or to host and deploy its payloads along additional malwares such as Lumma. With this\n\nreport, we aim to notably present the current infrastructure leveraged by threat actors to maintain the\n\nmalware, as well as the methods of distribution it presently uses to maximise the growth of its botnet.\n\n# 3. Sources of infections observed in September\n\n## 3.1. Search Engine Optimization\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction of this report, CryptBot is mainly distributed through cracked\n\nversions of commonly used software. The websites offering those software tend to be quite good in\n\nSearch Engine Optimization as they often appear in the first results of most browsers when looking for\n\ncracked programs. For example, in the figure below (Figure 1), we tried to see what websites would be\n\nput forward by Google when searching for a cracked version of “Wondershare Filmora”, a video editing\n\nsoftware frequently used by professionals. Out of the first four websites displayed by Google, the first\n\none (haxpc[.]net) was already offering a version of the software infected with CryptBot.\n\n2 _[https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/russian-targeting-gov-business/?hl=en](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/russian-targeting-gov-business/?hl=en)_\n\n3 _[https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/04/28/handout_google_cryptbot_complaint.pdf](https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/04/28/handout_google_cryptbot_complaint.pdf)_\n\n4 _[https://x.com/PRODAFT/status/1687107709626363905](https://x.com/PRODAFT/status/1687107709626363905)_\n\n5 _[https://x.com/PRODAFT/status/1687107709626363905](https://x.com/PRODAFT/status/1687107709626363905)_\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Google results when searching for cracked versions of Wondershare Filmora._\n\nSometimes the websites were typosquatted domains of legitimate software distributers like\n\n“filecr[.]com” from which a malicious domain “filecrr[.]org” was mimicking the landing page and\n\nname. In the figure below (figure 2), this fake website was distributing a version of Windows\n\nProfessional also infected with CryptBot.\n\n_Figure 2 Website distributing an infected version of Windows 10 Professional._\n\nThe email address “filecrr.org@gmail[.]com” linked to the website, was registered on LinkedIn and\n\nother various websites like Quora and Pinterest, with what we believe to be for SEO purposes as the\n\ninfected cracked software were being advertised on these websites with this account.\n\nThe location provided by the account on LinkedIn pointed to **Pakistan, which matches with the**\n\nnationality of the defendants accused by Google of running CryptBot’s distribution. Additionally, the\n\nmail server “mx1.hosting[.]pk”, used to register “filecrr[.]org”, happened to be a **Pakistani server**\n\nprovided by Hostinger, as the TLD indicates.\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. LinkedIn account registered with the email address linked to filecrr[.]org._\n\nOverall, all those malicious websites came in different languages and offered a wide range of\n\ncommonly used software.\n\n_Figure 4. Snippet of different websites distributing infected cracked software._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 3.1.1. Domains hosting the download links\n\nOnce a user tries to download a software from those websites, they get redirected to another\n\npage displaying a Mega or Dropbox link to a password protected archive.\n\n_Figure 5. Domain displaying a link to a Mega folder with the password of the archive hosted on it._\n\nThe page is available in other languages, including **Russian,** **French,** **Spanish, and** **German. If the**\n\nvisiting system is not from those countries, it just displays it in English by default.\n\n_Figure 6. Snippet of the JS code contained in the source code of the page._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n_Firebase hosting_\n\nOn a Russian website distributing torrents for games and generic software, the provided link\n\ncontaining the URL to the Mega/Dropbox folder happened to be hosted on a Firebase instance instead\n\nof the previous self-crafted website.\n\n_Figure 7. Snippet of the page distributing and alleged Russian version of Windows 10 on only-_\n\n**_soft[.]org._**\n\nOnly two days later, this instance would be taken down by Google. The website offering the cracked\n\nsoftware thus switched back to a generic domain “rar-freeload[.]com/vers01.0011”, crafted by the\n\nthreat actor. Despite Google’s complaint, CryptBot continues to be distributed through Google\n\nsolutions like Firebase. We can nonetheless acknowledge Google’s reactivity regarding the takedown\n\ntime laps.\n\n_Figure 8. Firebase page redirecting to the Mega folder containing the CryptBot archive._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 3.1.2. The CryptBot payload\n\nOnce we download the archive and decrypt it with the previously provided password, we\n\nobtain part of the legitimate software along with an executable named “Set-up.exe”; being the actual\n\n**CryptBot malware.**\n\n_Figure 9. Content of the downloaded archive._\n\nTo remain persistent on the system, CryptBot copied itself in AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ under the name\n\n“service123.exe” and created a schedule task with schtasks.exe named “ServiceData4”, in order for\n\nthe copy of the malware to launch at every start of the system.\n\n_Figure 10. Schtasks command launched by the CryptBot executable at launch to stay persistent._\n\nTo avoid reinfecting the same host, CryptBot created a mutex in:\n\n  - _\\Sessions\\1\\BaseNamedObjects\\QLEvFWjDaxiNdJEADjHk_\n\nAfter collecting the login information of the browsers installed on the system, CryptBot exfiltrated the\n\ndata by saving it in a seemingly encrypted file with a random name “Kecavase.bin” and sent it to its\n\nC2 with URL: “twov2pn[.]top/v1/upload.php”.\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. Content of the POST request that CryptBot sent to its C2._\n\nThe IP 185.244.181[.]38 the C2 domain resolved happens to resolve many other domains generated\n\nwith CryptBot’s DGA algorithm.\n\n_Figure 12. Snippet of the list of domains hosted on the above-mentioned IP._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following layout aims to summarize the overall kill chain related to a CryptBot infection.\n\n_Figure 13. Layout of CryptBot’s kill chain._\n\n## 3.2. Deployed by PrivateLoader\n\nCryptBot also relies on “Pay-Per-Install” services such as **InstallKeys** on Telegram, which\n\noffers access to machines by downloading its clients’ malwares on the systems that it previously\n\ninfected with **PrivateLoader. Like CryptBot, this service infects its victims through SEO and cracked**\n\nsoftware.\n\nIn the month of September, user “iamaachum” on MalwareBazaar observed that CryptBot was indeed\n\nbeing deployed by PrivateLoader payloads when the system language was set to **Italian.[6] Once**\n\ninfected by PrivateLoader, CryptBot would be downloaded from the following URLs:\n\n  - _147.45.44[.]104/prog/66dd5fafdeab3_lyla.exe_\n\n  - _147.45.44[.]104/revada/66deebee3b2d7_lyla2.exe_\n\n  - _147.45.44 [.]104/lopsa/66e2d83e11e31_lyla3.exe_\n\n  - _147.45.44[.]104/yuop/66e1de4b31f49_lyla23.exe_\n\n  - _103.130.147[.]211/Files/1.exe_\n\n  - _103.130.147[.]211/Files/Channel3.exe_\n\n  - _103.130.147[.]211/Files/Channel4.exe_\n\nPrivateLoader currently communicates with the following command-and-control servers:\n\n  - _45.91.200[.]135/api/crazyfish.php_\n\n  - _147.45.47[.]169/api/crazyfish.php_\n\n  - _212.113.116[.]202/api/crazyfish.php_\n\n  - _62.133.61[.]172/api/crazyfish.php_\n\n  - _92.246.139[.]82/api/crazyfish.php_\n\n6 _[https://bazaar.abuse.ch/user/14172/](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/user/14172/)_\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 3.2.1. Leveraging bulletproof hosting solutions\n\nAs you can observe, PrivateLoader uses IPs from ranges 147.45.47[.]0/24 and 147.45.47[.]0/24\n\nwhich are part of the **Ukrainian autonomous system named “Karina Rashkovska” (AS215789).** _In a_\n\n_previous investigation[7], Intrinsec CTI Team linked this network to a bulletproof hosting solution named_\n\n“Marshall Servers”, currently advertised on underground forums. We also believe with a high level of\n\n_confidence that this service is run by a Byelorussian individual named “Aliaksei_ **Bolbas” leading the**\n\ncompany “Waicore Hosting LTD.” registered in the United Kingdom. The mail server of the company\n\n“mail.waicore[.]com” happened to be hosted on 185.106.92[.]254, an IP now owned by “PSB Hosting\n\n_Ltd” (AS214927), the new owner of the IPv4 range_ **82.115.223[.]0/24 that** _Karina Rashkovksa used to_\n\npossess.\n\nComposed of four IPv4 ranges, this autonomous system based in the UK can also be linked to a\n\nbulletproof hosting service named “PSB Offshore” which promotes its services on underground forums\n\nwith the mention: “Bulletproof servers with a wide range of acceptable content”. We indeed previously\n\nreported how threat actors linked to Russia like UAC-0006 and Latrodectus decided to host some of\n\ntheir infrastructure on this network, at a time where it was only composed of one IPv4 range[8]. The\n\ndirector of the company _PSB HOSTING LTD_ is a Russian individual named “Skipin Vladislav\n\n**Andreevich”. In addition to AS “Karina Rashkovksa”,** PrivateLoader also used IPs from Russian\n\nbulletproof hosting solution “Aeza International Ltd” (AS210644), including **92.246.139[.]82 and**\n\n**212.113.116[.]202,** as C2 servers.\n\n_Figure 14. Layout of the links made between the above-mentioned entities._\n\n7 Intrinsec private report. \"Identifying Upstream Providers Peering with Bulletproof Networks\". July 2024.\n\n8 Intrinsec private report. \"Unveiling UAC-0006’s Infrastructure and Operations on Ukraine’s assets and its Allies\n_throughout 2024\". July 2024._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## 3.3. Deployed by SmokeLoader\n\nIn addition to PrivateLoader, we observed that SmokeLoader, another Russian loader sold on\n\nunderground forums that also spreads through cracked software, was being used to deploy CryptBot\n\nthroughout September. The malware was downloaded from the same URL as the one PrivateLoader\n\nused: “103.130.147[.]211/Files/Channel3.exe”. We believe that SmokeLoader was only used as a dropper\n\nsince it did not communicate with the C2s contained in its configuration and only downloaded\n\nCryptBot along other malwares.\n\nThe following SmokeLoader command-and-control domains could nonetheless be found in the\n\nmalware’s code (2022 version):\n\n  - _epohe[.]ru/tmp/_\n\n  - _olihonols.in[.]net/tmp/_\n\n  - _nicetolosv[.]xyz/tmp/_\n\n  - _jftolsa[.]ws/tmp/_\n\nCryptBot communicate with only one command-and-control domain contained in its configuration:\n\n  - _thirtv13pn[.]top/v1/upload.php (resolved IP 195.133.13[.]230)_\n\n  - _analforeverlovyu[.]top/v1/upload.php_\n\nThe IP of this single C2 was hosting a trove of other similar DGA generated domains used as CryptBot\n\nC2s:\n\n_Figure 15. Snippet of the domains hosted on IP 195.133.13[.]230._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## 3.4. Deployed by the Seychellois Amadey cluster\n\nTwo years ago, in September 2022, Team Cymru’s research team reported on an Amadey\n\ncluster hosted on an anonymous autonomous system based in **Seychelles (initially declared as**\n\n**Russian before November 2020[9]) named “1337TEAM LIMITED” (AS51381) that shares 100% of its peering**\n\nagreements with a **Russian autonomous system named “Storm Networks LLC” (AS43298).[10] As a**\n\nreminder, Amadey is Remote Access Trojan (RAT) sold underground forums by a Russian-speaking\n\nuser named “InCrease”. The Amadey C2s were hosted on the only IPv4 range of this autonomous\n\nsystem “185.215.113[.]0/24” The other autonomous systems registered by the company (AS60424,\n\n**AS56873 and AS39770) did not announce any IPv4 ranges.**\n\nWe noticed that this cluster was still online and was now using the latest version of Amadey released\n\nin August (version **4.41, botnet IDs:** **fed3aa &** **1176f2) to deploy** **CryptBot during the month of**\n\n**September 2024, along other malwares such as Redline, Stealc and Lumma.**\n\nCryptBot happened to be downloaded from the same IP as the one we found in the PrivateLoader and\n\nSmokeLoader campaigns:\n\n     - _103.130.147[.]211/Files/2.exe_\n\n     - _103.130.147[.]211/Files/Channel4.exe_\n\nThe first Amadey payload named “ednfoki.exe” associated to botnet “1176f2”, communicated with the\n\nfollowing C2:\n\n  - _185.215.113[.]19/CoreOPT/index.php_\n\nThe second Amadey payload named “apxlong.exe” associated to botnet “fed3aa”, communicated\n\nwith the following C2:\n\n  - _185.215.113[.]16/Jo89Ku7d/index.php_\n\nOverall, This C2 was used to host more than around 70,000 bots since its creation.\n\n_Figure 16. Number of infected systems that connected to the C2._\n\n9 _[https://bgpranking.circl.lu/asn](https://bgpranking.circl.lu/asn)_\n\n10 _[https://www.team-cymru.com/post/seychelles-seychelles-on-the-c-2-shore](https://www.team-cymru.com/post/seychelles-seychelles-on-the-c-2-shore)_\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\nRegarding the other malwares that were deployed by these Amadey campaigns, the Redline payload\n\ncommunicated with IP “65.21.18[.]51” on port **45580 and was associated to the botnet ID**\n\n“@OLEH_PSP”. This is a reference signature to the Telegram channel of the same name that sells logs\n\nstolen by infostealers, inducing that the owner of this channel “KomandoR” (now banned from XSS\n\nforum) has indeed control over this Redline botnet.\n\n_Figure 17. Telegram channel allegedly in control of the previously found Redline payload._\n\nWe believe that this Amadey cluster could be owned by bigger “traffers” selling traffic to those kinds\n\nof Telegram channel, as multiple other stealers with C2s hosted by different AS other than _1337TEAM_\n\n_LIMITED were deployed. We unfortunately could not associate the rest of those payloads to any known_\n\nbotnet or Telegram channel.\n\nThe Stealc payload for example, communicated with a different Russian bulletproof autonomous\n\nsystem named “PROSPERO OOO” (AS200593), with a C2 hosted on IP 91.202.233[.]158. This autonomous\n\nsystem indeed mainly hosts criminal activities on its network,[11] and in particular a major part of\n\nGootloader’s infrastructure.[12] We have notably released a public report on Intrinsec’s blog regarding\n\nthis network.\n\n\n##### PROSPERO OOO\n\nThe Russian autonomous system PROSPERO OOO (AS200593) could be linked with a high level of\n\nconfidence to Proton66 OOO (AS198953), another Russian AS, that we believe to be connected to\nthe bulletproof services named \"SecureHost\" and \"BEARHOST\". The connection between PROSPERO\n\nand Proton66 could be made through similarities in the way both networks are operated, notably in\ntheir respective peering agreements shared with other Russian networks.[13]\n\nSecureHost is a bulletproof hosting provider advertised since 2022 on underground Russianspeaking forums. It notably declares ignoring DMCA and Spamhaus requests. The servers are\n\nlocated in Russia, with a direct access to an Internet Exchange Point (IX).\n\n\n11 _[https://web.archive.org/web/20231018093233/https:/oliverhough.io/prospernot-prospero-as-the-little-as-](https://web.archive.org/web/20231018093233/https:/oliverhough.io/prospernot-prospero-as-the-little-as-that-could-part-1/)_\n\n_[that-could-part-1/](https://web.archive.org/web/20231018093233/https:/oliverhough.io/prospernot-prospero-as-the-little-as-that-could-part-1/)_\n\n12 _[https://x.com/Gootloader/status/1778786008219128088](https://x.com/Gootloader/status/1778786008219128088)_\n\n13 [https://www.intrinsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TLP-CLEAR-PROSPERO-Proton66-Uncovering-the-](https://www.intrinsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TLP-CLEAR-PROSPERO-Proton66-Uncovering-the-links-between-bulletproof-networks.pdf)\n\n[links-between-bulletproof-networks.pdf](https://www.intrinsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TLP-CLEAR-PROSPERO-Proton66-Uncovering-the-links-between-bulletproof-networks.pdf)\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## 3.5. Deployed through PDF documents\n\nCryptBot is also currently being deployed through PDF documents displaying fake instructions\n\nfor downloading cracked commercial software. The instructions contained in the document simply\n\nask the user to disable their anti-virus and click on a provided link that happens to redirect to the\n\ndomains we previously found (see “3.1.1. Domains hosting the download links” part of this report).\n\n_Figure 18. Content of one of those malicious PDF documents._\n\nThis specific PDF file was contained in many archives downloaded from websites distributing cracked\n\nsoftware. As one can observe in the figure below (figure 18), the archives’ names could give us a hint\n\nof which software were targeted and spoofed.\n\n_Figure 19.

Following Matomo to find the redirecting domains\n\nAll the domains that provided the URL to the Mega folder containing CryptBot’s archive used a\n\n**Matomo tracking script. As a reminder, Matomo, like Google Analytics, is a web analytics software**\n\nplatform providing detailed reports on a website and its visitors. This includes the search engines and\n\nkeywords they used, the language they speak, which pages they like, **the files they download and**\n\nother various things.\n\nThis tracking script named “track.js”, sent all those details to “mtmoweb[.]website”, a Matomo\n\ninstance operated by the threat actor. We believe that the threat actor uses this method to get an\n\noverview of which websites distributing cracked software generate the most traffic and with which\n\nsoftware specifically to improve their campaigns. This could even be a way for the threat actor to\n\nremunerate the individuals operating those websites according to the amount of traffic they generate.\n\n_Figure 20. Content of the “track.js” script._\n\nBy scanning websites containing this specific script, we were able to track every domain hosting the\n\nURL link to the Mega folder distributing CryptBot infected archives (see “Indicators of compromise”\n\nsection of this report for the full list). The figure below (figure 20) aims to summarize the followed\n\nmethod:\n\n_Figure 21. Layout summarizing the method employed to track the domains redirecting to the Mega_\n\n_folders._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## 4.1. Domains hosted by Aeza servers in France\n\nRetrieving those domains enabled us to get an overview of how they were operated\n\nthroughout time. We noticed that they were fronted by either _DDOS-Guard – AS57724 (a Russian_\n\nCloudflare-like solution) or directly by _Cloudflare – AS13335; thus, hiding the real IP of the servers_\n\nhosting them. However, some of them would sometime not be fronted by those services and directly\n\nrevealing their IP.\n\nWhen not fronted, all those domains were hosted on one of the two autonomous systems managed\n\nby the Russian bulletproof hosting provider **Aeza, being either AS210644 (Aeza International Ltd) or**\n\n**AS216246 (Aeza Group Ltd.). One IP, 147.45.68[.]130, managed by AS210644 and apparently located in**\n\n**France, was hosting redirecting domains with instructions displayed in French. The other IP that we**\n\nmostly observed to be hosting the same domains was located in Russia and managed by AS216246\n\n(185.112.83[.]145).\n\n_Figure 22. Instructions displayed in French and hosted on French Aeza server 147.45.68[.]130._\n\n_Domains: sarahmakesitbetter[.]com, rivistablog[.]com, anotherconversation[.]com, and_\n\n_puntext[.]com._\n\n\n##### Aeza International Ltd.\n\nIn recent months, Intrinsec’s CTI team has been noticing the recrudescence of a variety of malware\n\ncommand-and-control servers being hosted on the same Autonomous System named _Aeza_\n_International Ltd. (AS210644). This service has been growing since 2021 under a different name Aeza_\n\n_Group Ltd. (AS216246). Before creating the company, the founder of Aeza was involved in another_\nRussian bulletproof hosting provider named “MskHost”, which was hacked by hacktivists and\n\neventually shutdown by their creators.\nMajor actors like TA577 have been using this service for their campaigns and we believe that it will\n\nremain the case for both sophisticated and basic threat actors.\n\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## 4.2. Lumma deployment\n\nAfter retrieving those domains by scanning for the present of the Matomo script in their code,\n\nwe found that the same domain could in fact redirect to multiple other Mega or Dropbox folders.\n\nDepending on the URL, the website could point to either a CryptBot or a Lumma infected archive.\n\nLike the domain “rars-freeload[.]com”, where the URL “rars-freeload[.]com/thre” would point to a\n\nMega folder hosting a **Lumma infected archive, and “rars-freeload[.]com/vs012/” would point to a**\n\n**CryptBot infected archive.**\n\nThe downloaded Lumma payload happened to communicate with the same C2 domains as the\n\npayload downloaded by the Amadey cluster hosted on 1337TEAM LIMITED.\n\n_Figure 23. Layout summarizing the concept above-mentioned._\n\n# 5. Pivoting to find other distribution websites\n\nMore than a hundred of websites offering cracked versions of software were hosted on IP\n\n**195.66.210[.]137, managed by** **Ukrainian autonomous system “Virtual Systems LLC” (AS6698).**\n\nAmong those, “drapk[.]net” for example, distributes fake APK and redirects to “techjbc[.]cfd”, a\n\ndifferent domain that the ones we previously observed but still linked to an URL leading to the same\n\nMega folder containing the identical archive infected with **CryptBot. Consult the “Indicator of**\n\ncompromise” section of this report for the complete list of websites that could be found.\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 24. Snippet of the domains found to be hosted on 195.66.210[.]137._\n\nSome of the domains used as redirectors would display the same Common Name (CN) field. Through\n\nthis pivot, a few additional ones could be discovered.\n\n\n##### Domain name\n\n\ntechjbc[.]cfd\n\nsultanisback[.]pro\n\nfilemirrormegaz[.]shop\n\nallgetinopcc[.]cfd\n\nfree4pc[.]shop\n\nAdditionally, by inspecting the content of autonomous systems like _IP Volume Inc. -_ **AS202425, a**\n\nnetwork based in the Seychelles that we attribute with a high level of confidence to the creators of the\n\nnew defunct Ecatel, we discovered much more domains used for the same purposes.

The company was registered in\n\nKent (United Kingdom) with its headquarters in The Hague. In 2011, the company got into an\nargument with the data centre in Alphen aan de Rijn where they rented servers. Thereupon, they\n\ndecided to start their own data centre called DataOne in Wormer.[15]\nIn December 2015, IP addresses from Ecatel moved to a new company registered in Seychelles\n\nnamed Quasi Network, which later changed to “IP Volume Inc”. In 2020, the Ministry of Justice and\nSecurity of the Netherlands published a ranking of Dutch hosting companies with the most child\n\npornography on their servers. With 4,500 out of 175,000 verified reports, IP Volume Inc ranked\n**second.[16]**\n\nIn addition to IP Volume Inc, Ecatel’s directors created another company in the Netherlands named\n“FiberXpress BV”[17], associated to the autonomous system AS57717. IP Volume Inc obtains upstream\n\nfrom this network by sharing **74.5% of its peering agreements. Overall, the autonomous system**\nmanages 1,792 IPv4. The address of the company is the same as their datacentre in Wormer, where\n\nall of their other Dutch companies are also located.[18]\nBy analysing the various contents hosted on FiberXpress BV, we discovered a trove of domains that\n\nwere part of a large network of fake websites distributing copies of cracked software or video\ngames. In some cases, those websites switched from being hosted on IP Volume Inc to FiberXpress\n\n_BV, such as “crackedkeys.softwaresdaily[.]com” for example._\n\n\n_Figure 25.

Conclusion\n\nThis report aimed to give an insight on the current spreading methods leveraged by CryptBot\n\nand the various collaborations that it maintains with other threat actors within the cybercrime\n\necosystem. We also highlighted how some of these actors like the Pay-Per-Install service running the\n\nPrivateLoader malware continue to rely on **bulletproof hosting providers. This requires keeping on**\n\nmonitoring these networks due to the frequency of their infrastructure changes, as we could observe\n\nin the IPv4 ranges that were moved from a bulletproof autonomous system to another. Most of those\n\nnetworks’ malicious nature had already been unveiled in previous investigations of Intrinsec’s CTI\n\nteam. By blocking those autonomous systems, the campaigns analysed in this report could have\n\neventually been diffused.\n\nAll those different sources of infections leading to the deployment of CryptBot underline the threat\n\nactor’s will to rapidly expand its botnet, probably in response to Google’s efforts in taking down the\n\nmalware’s infrastructure which drastically lowered the infection rate. This also shows that despite\n\nhaving companies with major strike power like Google engaging in legal procedures, those threats\n\ncan still prosper and expand. The main solution continues to be proactive in tracking their last TTPS,\n\nrelated IoCs, code evolution, capacities, and C2 communications overall.\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n# 7.
