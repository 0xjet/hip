This is currently under\ninvestigation, to understand the cause,“ a company representative told us.\n\nFrom what is known at this point, the issues have not influenced the Japanese production\nor dealer activities. Furthermore, the company spokesperson said that there is no impact on\nHonda customers.\n\n“In Europe, we are investigating to understand the nature of any impact” - Honda\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the Japanese car manufacturer is tight-lipped about these events, a security\n[researcher named Milkream has found a sample of the SNAKE (EKANS) ransomware](https://twitter.com/milkr3am)\nsubmitted to VirusTotal today that checks for the internal Honda network name of\n\"mds.honda.com.\"\n\nWhen BleepingComputer tried to analyze the sample, the ransomware would start and\nimmediately exit without encrypting any files.\n\nThe researcher states that this is because the ransomware tries to resolve the\n\"mds.honda.com\" domain, and failing to do so, will terminate the ransomware without\nencrypting any files.\n\nSecurity researcher Vitali Kremez has also told BleepingComputer that in addition to the\nmds.honda.com check, it also contains a reference to the U.S. IP address 170.108.71.15.\n\nThis IP address resolves to the 'unspec170108.amerhonda.com' hostname.\n\nThe reference to this IP address and the internal hostname check are very strong indicators\nthat today's network outages are being caused by a SNAKE ransomware attack.\n\n**Snake Ransom note dropped by sample found today**\n\ncredit: [milkream](https://twitter.com/milkr3am)\nIt is unclear how many systems are affected but Snake is known to steal data before\ndeploying the encryption routine. In a statement to BleepingComputer on Tuesday, Honda\nsays that they can \"confirm that there is no information breach at this point in time.\"\n\n\"Work is being undertaken to minimise the impact and to restore full functionality of\nproduction, sales and development activities. At this point, we see minimal business impact\"\n\n- Honda representative\n\nBleepingComputer reached out to the SNAKE ransomware operators, and while they did\nnot admit to the attack they did not deny it either\n\n\n-----\n\nAt this time we will not share details about the attack in order to allow the target some\ndeniability. This will change as time passes,\" the SNAKE operators told BleepingComputer.\n\n## Open database leaks sensitive info\n\nIf this proves to be an intrusion from an unauthorized party, it would be a significantly\ndifferent security incident than what the company had to deal with last year when\nmisconfigured databases exposed sensitive information on the public internet.\n\n[At the end of July 2019, security researcher Justin Paine found an unsecured ElasticSearch](https://twitter.com/xxdesmus)\ndatabase containing information on about 300,000 Honda employees across the world,\nincluding the CEO.\n\nApart from personally identifiable information, the database instance included details about\nmachines on the network, like the version of the operating system, hostnames, and patch\nstatus.\n\nAccording to Paine’s research, a table called “uncontrolledmachines” listed systems on the\ninternal network that did not have security software installed.\n\n\"If an attacker is looking for a way into Honda's network knowing which machines are far\nless likely to identify/block their attacks would be critical information. These \"uncontrolled\n[machines\" could very easily be the open door into the entire network,\" Paine said](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/honda-exposes-26-000-records-of-north-american-customers/)\n\nAnother open ElasticSearch database belonging to Honda was discovered on December 11\nlast year by [security researcher Bob Diachenko. The records were unprotected on the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/honda-exposes-26-000-records-of-north-american-customers/)\npublic internet and included data about customers in North America.\n\nThe database was from a data logging and monitoring server for telematics services. It\nincluded full names, email addresses, phone numbers, postal addresses, vehicle make and\nmodel, as well as its identification number (VIN).\n\nThe company estimated that about 26,000 unique consumer-related records were exposed\ndue to the misconfigured database.\n\n**Update 6/8/20: Added information about a Honda IP address in the ransomware**\nexecutable and a statement from the SNAKE ransomware operators.\n\n**Update 6/9/20: Added details from a second statement from Honda about the risk of**\ninformation breach and the impact on business.\n\n_This is a developing story_\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Honda](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/honda/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Snake](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/snake/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
