As a final step the wiper reboots [the] computer.\"\n\n\n-----\n\n[Specifically, HermeticWiper is delivered via the benign but signed EaseUS partition management](https://twitter.com/0xAmit/status/1496641159371837444)\n[driver that then proceeds to impair the first 512 bytes, the Master Boot Record (MBR) for every](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record)\nphysical drive, before initiating a system shutdown and effectively rendering the machine\ninoperable.\n\n\"After a week of defacements and increasing DDoS attacks, the proliferation of sabotage operations\nthrough wiper malware is an expected and regrettable escalation,\" SentinelOne's principal threat\n[researcher Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade said in a report analyzing the new malware.](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/hermetic-wiper-ukraine-under-attack/)\n\nAt least one of the intrusions involved deploying the malware directly from the Windows domain\ncontroller, indicating that the attackers had taken control of the target network.\n\nThe scale and the impact of the data-wiping attacks remains unknown as yet, as is the identity of\nthe threat actor behind the infections. But the development marks the second time this year that a\n[destructive malware has been deployed on Ukrainian computer systems after the WhisperGate](https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/a-new-destructive-malware-targeting.html)\noperation in mid-January.\n\n[The wiper attacks also follow a third \"massive\" wave of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks](https://cip.gov.ua/en/news/chergova-kiberataka-na-saiti-derzhavnikh-organiv-ta-banki)\nthat hit several Ukrainian government and banking institutions on Wednesday, knocking out online\nportals for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Cabinet of Ministers, and Rada, the country's parliament.\n\n\n-----\n\nLast week, two of the largest Ukrainian banks, PrivatBank and Oschadbank, as well as the\n[websites of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces suffered outages as a result of](https://cip.gov.ua/en/news/shodo-kiberataki-na-saiti-viiskovikh-struktur-ta-derzhavnikh-bankiv)\na [DDoS attack from unknown actors, prompting the U.K. and](https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1493628291844083723) [U.S. governments to point the fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HycneIX8Zos)\n[at the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), an allegation the Kremlin has denied.](https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/kremlin-denies-russia-behind-ukraine-cyberattack.html)\n\nCampaigns that use DDoS attacks deliver torrents of junk traffic that are intended to overwhelm\ntargets with the goal of rendering them inaccessible. A subsequent analysis of the February 15\nincidents by the CERT-UA [found that they were carried out using botnets such as Mirai and](https://cert.gov.ua/article/37139) [Mēris](https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/meris-botnet-hit-russias-yandex-with.html)\n[by leveraging compromised MikroTik routers and other IoT devices.](https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/over-300000-mikrotik-devices-found.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\nWhat's more, information systems belonging to Ukraine's state institutions are said to have been\n[unsuccessfully targeted in as many as 121 cyber attacks in January 2022 alone.](https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/u-sichni-2022-roku-sbu-zablokuvala-ponad-120-kiberatak-na-ukrainski-orhany-vlady)\n\nThat's not all. Cybercriminals on the dark web are looking to capitalize on the ongoing political\ntensions by advertising databases and network accesses containing information on Ukrainian\ncitizens and critical infra entities on RaidForums and Free Civilian marketplaces in \"hopes of\n[gaining high profits,\" according to a report published by Accenture earlier this week.](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/cyber-defense/ukraine-russia-2022)\n\nThe [continuous onslaught of disruptive malicious cyber acts since the start of the year has also led](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/ukraine-continues-to-face-cyber.html)\nthe Ukrainian law enforcement authority to paint the attacks as an effort to spread anxiety,\nundermine confidence in the state's ability to defend its citizens, and destabilize its unity.\n\n\n-----\n\nUkraine is facing attempts to systematically sow panic, spread fake information and distort the real\n[state of affairs,\" the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) said on February 14. \"All this combined is](https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/zaiava-sbu-shchodo-proiaviv-hibrydnoi-viiny-v-informatsiinomu-prostori)\nnothing more than another massive wave of hybrid warfare.\"\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
