Global experts are using massive\npreventative efforts to combat hackers who are working day-in and day-out to produce an\nexploit that can successfully leverage the remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft\nExchange.\n\nCPR has outlined the disclosed vulnerabilities, the targeted organizations by country and\nindustry, and then recommendations to prevent the attacks, which are yet to come.\n\n**Current attack attempts in numbers**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe country most attacked has been The United States (17% of all exploit attempts),\nfollowed by Germany (6%), the United Kingdom (5%), The Netherlands (5%) and Russia\n(4%).\n\n\n-----\n\nMost targeted industry sector has been Government/Military (23% of all exploit attempts),\nfollowed by Manufacturing (15%), Banking & Financial Services (14%), Software vendors\n(7%) and Healthcare (6%).\n\n**Behind-the-scenes of the Zero Days**\n\nOn March 3, 2021 Microsoft released an emergency patch for its Exchange Server product,\nthe most popular mail server worldwide. All incoming and outgoing emails, calendar\ninvitations and virtually anything accessed within Outlook goes through the Exchange\nserver.\n\nOrange Tsai (Cheng-Da Tsai) from DEVCORE, a security firm based in Taiwan, reported\ntwo vulnerabilities in January. Unware of the full magnitude of these findings, Microsoft was\nprompted to further investigate their Exchange server. The investigation uncovered five\nmore critical vulnerabilities.\n\nThe vulnerabilities allow an attacker to read emails from an Exchange server without\nauthentication or accessing an individual’s email account. Further vulnerability chaining\nenables attackers to completely take over the mail server itself.\n\nOnce an attacker takes over the Exchange server, they can open the network to the internet\nand access it remotely. As many Exchange servers have internet exposer (specifically\nOutlook Web Access feature) and are integrated within the broader network, this poses a\ncritical security risk for millions of organizations.\n\n[Orange Tsai (Cheng-Da Tsai) teaser for pre-authentication remote code execution chain on Twitter,](https://twitter.com/orange_8361/status/1346401788811825153)\n\nJan 05,2021\n\n**What organizations are at risk?**\n\nIf your organization’s Microsoft Exchange server is exposed to the internet, and has not\nbeen updated with the latest patches nor protected by a third party software such as Check\nPoint, then you should assume the server is completely compromised. Compromised\nservers could enable an unauthorized attacker to extract your corporate emails and execute\nmalicious code inside your organization with high privileges.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Technical Explanation**\n\nCVE-2021-26855 – is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Exchange\nwhich allows the attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests and authenticate as the\nExchange server.\nCVE-2021-26857 – is an insecure deserialization vulnerability in the Unified\nMessaging service. Insecure deserialization is where untrusted user-controllable data\nis desterilized by a program. Exploiting this vulnerability gives HAFNIUM the ability to\nrun code as SYSTEM on the Exchange server. This requires administrator permission\nor another vulnerability to exploit.\nCVE-2021-26858 – is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in\nExchange. If HAFNIUM could authenticate with the Exchange server then they could\nuse this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. They could authenticate\nby exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate\nadmin’s credentials.\nCVE-2021-27065 – is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in\nExchange. If HAFNIUM could authenticate with the Exchange server then they could\nuse this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. They could authenticate\nby exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate\nadmin’s credentials.\n\nSince the disclosure, CPR has received questions regarding the identity of the attackers,\ntheir motivation and the wide context of recent major hacks.\n\nIn this attack, as in Sunburst, a particularly common platform was used as a front door for\ncovert entry and prolonged stay within the network. The good news is that only highly\nskilled and well-financed threat actors are capable of using the front door to potentially enter\ntens of thousands of organizations worldwide. While hacking the exchange server with zero\ndays is quite impressive, the purpose of the attack and what cybercriminals wanted within\nthe network is still unknown. Organizations who are at risk should not only take preventive\nactions on their Exchange, but also scan their networks for live threats and assess all\nassets.\n\n**Prevent Future Attacks and Remain Protected**\n\nHere are Check Point’s recommendations to prevent future attacks and remain protected:\n\n**Patch – immediately update all Microsoft Exchange Servers to the latest patched**\nversions available by Microsoft. This update is not automatic and you are expected to\nperform it manually.\n**Threat Prevention protections – Check Point provides comprehensive security**\ncoverage to the vulnerabilities reported by Microsoft with the following Threat\nPrevention protections:\n\n\n-----\n\n**[IPS](https://www.checkpoint.com/products/intrusion-prevention-system-ips/)**\n\n[CVE-2021-26855 – CPAI-2021-0099](https://www.checkpoint.com/defense/advisories/public/2021/CPAI-2021-0099.html)\n[CVE-2021-26857 – CPAI-2021-0107](https://www.checkpoint.com/defense/advisories/public/2021/CPAI-2021-0107.html)\n[CVE-2021-26858 – CPAI-2021-0107](https://www.checkpoint.com/defense/advisories/public/2021/CPAI-2021-0107.html)\n[CVE-2021-27065 – CPAI-2021-0099](https://www.checkpoint.com/defense/advisories/public/2021/CPAI-2021-0099.html)\n\n**Threat Emulation**\n\nWinsCVE-2021-27065.A\n\n**Anti-Virus**\n\nTC.
