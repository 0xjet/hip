U.S.](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/fin7/)\n[prosecutors had accused Kolpakov, a Ukrainian national, of working as a manager and](https://www.cyberscoop.com/fin7-andrii-kolpakov-extradition-spain/)\nrecruiter for the crew, a role in which he hired and supervised computer specialists who\nspent their days stealing payment card information from dozens of companies, including\nChipotle, Red Robin and Sonic Drive-In.\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring the course of the scheme, [Kolpakov] received compensation for his participation in\nFIN7, which far exceeds comparable legitimate employment in Ukraine,” the plea deal notes.\n“For the purposes of this plea agreement, the parties agree that — during [Kolpakov’s]\nparticipation in the malware scheme — FIN7 illegal activity resulted in over $100 million in\nlosses to financial institutions, merchant processors, insurance companies, retail companies\nand individual cardholders.”\n\nFIN7 is a notorious cybercrime group that’s attracted from international law enforcement\nagencies and an array of private security firms. Dozens of hackers worked as part of the\nscheme, according to the U.S. Justice Department, masquerading as a legitimate vendor\n[called “Combi Security,” which presented itself as a penetration testing company. Rather than](https://www.cyberscoop.com/chinese-iranian-hackers-front-companies/)\nconducting security assessments, though, FIN7, would breach protected systems to steal\ncredit data and other personal information.\n\n[Researchers have blamed the group for stealing more than $1 billion. The target list also](https://www.wired.com/story/fin7-carbanak-hacking-group-behind-a-string-of-big-breaches/)\nincluded Whole Foods, Saks Fifth Avenue, Trump Hotels and other organizations with a\nwealth of customer payment data. Scammers still were using FIN7 malware into 2020,\nresearchers have found.\n\n[Spanish police arrested Kolpakov in June 2018, ultimately extraditing him to the U.S. in](https://www.cyberscoop.com/fin7-andrii-kolpakov-extradition-spain/)\n2019. Kolpakov was in possession of a laptop computer, multiple hard drives and a mobile\nphone containing “multiple thousands of payment card numbers” and usernames and\npasswords stolen from American companies, according to the plea deal.\n\nKolpakov now faces up to 25 years in prison under the terms of the plea deal.\n\nFedir Hladyr, another FIN7 member, [pleaded guilty in September 2019. Hladyr’s sentencing](https://www.cyberscoop.com/fin7-fedir-hladyr-guilty-carbanak/)\nis scheduled for Dec. 11.\n\nKolpakov’s plea agreement is available in full below.\n\n\n-----",
