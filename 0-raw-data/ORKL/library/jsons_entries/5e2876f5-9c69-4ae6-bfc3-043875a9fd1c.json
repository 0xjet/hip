See the talk I gave at BH/DC for more context on leaked certificates:\n[https://t.co/UWu3AzHc66](https://t.co/UWu3AzHc66) [pic.twitter.com/gCrol0BxHd](https://t.co/gCrol0BxHd)\n\n[— Bill Demirkapi (@BillDemirkapi) March 3, 2022](https://twitter.com/BillDemirkapi/status/1499437244830175236?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nA code-signing certificate allows developers to digitally sign executables and drivers so that\nWindows and end-users can verify the file's owner and whether they have been tampered\nwith by a third party.\n\nTo increase security in Windows, Microsoft also requires kernel-mode drivers to be code\nsigned before the operating system will load them.\n\n## NVIDIA certificates used to sign malware\n\nAfter Lapsus$ leaked NVIDIA's code-signing certificates, security researchers quickly\nfound that the certificates were being used to sign malware and other tools used by threat\nactors.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to samples uploaded to the VirusTotal malware scanning service, the stolen\ncertificates were used to sign various malware and hacking tools, such as Cobalt Strike\nbeacons, Mimikatz, backdoors, and remote access trojans.\n\nFor example, one threat actor used the certificate to sign a Quasar remote access trojan\n\n[[VirusTotal], while someone else used the certificate to sign a Windows driver [VirusTotal].](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/065077fa74c211adf9563f00e57b5daf9594e72cea15b1c470d41b756c3b87e1)\n\n**Quasar RAT signed by**\n\n**NVIDIA certificate**\n[Security researchers Kevin Beaumont and](https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog) [Will Dormann shared that the stolen certificates](https://twitter.com/wdormann)\nutilize the following serial numbers:\n```\n43BB437D609866286DD839E1D00309F5\n14781bc862e8dc503a559346f5dcc518\n\n```\nSome of the files were likely uploaded to VirusTotal by security researchers but others\n[appear to be used by threat actors for malware campaigns [1,](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a0aa66f6639e2b54a908115571c85285598845d3e52888fe27c6b35f6900fe56/detection) [2].](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a7c3ce181e5c3956bb6b9b92e862b6fea6d6d3be1a38321ebb84428dde127677/relations)\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile both stolen NVIDIA certificates are expired, Windows will still allow a driver signed with\nthe certificates to be loaded in the operating system.\n\nTherefore, using these stolen certificates, threat actors gain the advantage of making their\nprograms look like legitimate NVIDIA programs and allowing malicious drivers to be loaded\nby Windows.\n\n**Signed Quasar RAT sample**\n\nTo prevent known vulnerable drivers from being loaded in Windows, David Weston, director\nof enterprise and OS security at Microsoft, tweeted that admins can configure Windows\nDefender Application Control policies to control what NVIDIA drivers can be loaded.\n\nWDAC policies work on both 10-11 with no hardware requirements down to the home\nSKU despite some FUD misinformation i have seen so it should be your first choice.\nCreate a policy with the Wizard and then add a deny rule or allow specific versions of\nNvidia if you need\n\n— David Weston (DWIZZZLE) (@dwizzzleMSFT) [March 3, 2022](https://twitter.com/dwizzzleMSFT/status/1499527802382471188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nHowever, using WDAC is not an easy task, especially for non-IT Windows users.\n\n\n-----\n\nDue to the potential for abuse, it is hoped that the stolen certificates will be added to\nMicrosoft's certificate revocation list in the future to prevent malicious drivers from loading in\nWindows.\n\nHowever, doing so will cause legitimate NVIDIA drivers to be blocked as well, so we will\nlikely not see this happening soon.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[NVIDIA fixes ten vulnerabilities in Windows GPU display drivers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nvidia-fixes-ten-vulnerabilities-in-windows-gpu-display-drivers/)\n\n[NVIDIA has open-sourced its Linux GPU kernel drivers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/linux/nvidia-has-open-sourced-its-linux-gpu-kernel-drivers/)\n\n[NVIDIA fined for failure to disclose cryptomining sales boost](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/nvidia-fined-for-failure-to-disclose-cryptomining-sales-boost/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
