The simple nature of such attacks combined with the use of\nmalicious JavaScript code for intercepting payment data attract more and more\ncybercriminals, and JS-sniffers became one of the most prominent sources of stolen bank\ncards on underground markets. However, in one recent campaign we saw a big step forward\nin attacks on e-commerce websites involving JS-sniffers.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In July 2020, Sansec published an article about the attacks on US and European online](https://sansec.io/research/north-korea-magecart)\nshops with the use of JavaScript sniffers (JS-sniffers). The researchers attributed the\n\"clientToken=\" campaign to the North Korean APT called Lazarus (aka Dark Seoul Gang,\nHIDDEN COBRA, Guardians of Peace, APT38, APT-C-26, Labyrinth Chollima, Zinc,\nBluenoroff, Stardust Chollima).\n\nThe Group-IB Threat Intelligence team looked deeper into these campaigns and identified\nanother campaign involving the same infrastructure. The threat actor went back to the old\n**habit of stealing crypto using a never-before-seen tool. Lazarus attacked online stores**\nwhich accept cryptocurrency payments through crypto skimmers: JS-sniffers modified for the\npurpose of stealing crypto currency. Some victims, identified by Sansec, in fact, didn't fell\nprey to the clientToken= campaign, but to a different, previously undocumented Lazarus\ncampaign, codenamed BTC Changer by Group-IB researchers. Group-IB's TI&A team\nidentified BTC addresses used by Lazarus and have analyzed the transactions. Group-IB\nfound additional evidence of Lazarus involvement in the campaigns.\n\nGroup-IB researchers analyzed the newly discovered attacks, described the links with the\nclientToken= campaign, analyzed the transactions associated with the wallets controlled by\nthe gang, and estimated Lazarus' profits from the use of crypto-stealing JS-sniffers at\n0.89993859 BTC ($8,446.55 at the moment of the transaction and $52,611 as of April 9,\n2021) and 4.384719 ETH, ($9,047 as of April 9, 2021).\n\n**Initial discovery**\n\nThe clientToken= campaign conducted by Lazarus and identified by Sansec started in May\n2019. During the campaign, the attackers used a list of compromised websites for hosting\nmalicious JavaScript files to steal bank card information from European and US online\nshoppers:\n\nstefanoturco[.]com\ntechnokain[.]com\ndarvishkhan[.]net\nareac-agr[.]com\nluxmodelagency[.]com\nsignedbooksandcollectibles[.]com\n\nThe same compromised websites were also used as gates for receiving collected payment\ninformation from infected websites. Links to JavaScript files on compromised websites were\ninjected into the source code of various online shops.\n\nGroup-IB researchers discovered that, in late February 2020, Lazarus started using a\nmodified version of the malicious JavaScript script that was initially used during the\nclientToken= campaign all the while using the same infrastructure. The new version had the\nsame names of functions, but bank card harvesting was replaced with cryptocurrency\n\n\n-----\n\nskimming and they started targeting companies who accepted payments in BTC. The new\nversion of the malicious JavaScript, which Group-IB researchers named Lazarus BTC\nChanger, was designed to switch the destination payment address to the attackers' BTC\naddress.\n\n_Fig. 1: Snippet of source code for Lazarus BTC Changer_\n\nTo store malicious JavaScript files, the attackers used compromised the website\n**luxmodelagency[.]com, just like with the clientToken= campaign. In some cases, they also**\nused internal JavaScript files of the infected websites as storage for malicious JavaScript.\n\n**Analysis of Lazarus BTC Changer campaign**\n\n**INFECTED WEBSITES**\n\nWhile analyzing Lazarus BTC Changer, we identified three compromised websites, two of\nwhich were listed in Sansec's article as victims of the clientToken= campaign: \"Realchems\"\n[(https://realchems.com/) and \"Wongs Jewellers\" (https://www.wongsjewellers.co.uk/). In the](https://realchems.com/)\ncase of Wongs Jewellers, we identified a sample of Lazarus BTC Changer on their website,\nbut we did not find any evidence that the shop accepts cryptocurrency, so the attackers\nprobably added Lazarus BTC Changer to the website by mistake. The third victim is an\n\n\n-----\n\nItalian luxury clothes shop, but malicious code was removed from the website at the moment\nof analysis.\n\n**SAMPLES**\n\nLike all traditional JS-sniffers, Lazarus BTC Changer detects when users are on the checkout\npage of an infected website, but instead of collecting bank card details, it replaces the BTC\nor ETH address owned by the shop with an address used by the hackers. A snippet of such\nJavaScript code is shown in Figure 2 along with the BTC address used by the attackers\n**(1MQC6C4FVX8RhmWESWsazEb5dyDBhxH9he) and the ETH address**\n**(0x460ab1c34e4388704c5e56e18D904Ed117D077CC).**\n\n_Fig. 2: Lazarus BTC Changer sample with BTC and ETH addresses_\n\nIn late March 2020, the attackers added a fake web payment form to their arsenal. The form\nopens in an iframe element.\n\n_Fig. 3: Lazarus BTC Changer with a fake payment form_\n\nThe fake form (Figure 4) asks that the payment be made directly to the BTC address\ncontrolled by the hackers (1MQC6C4FVX8RhmWESWsazEb5dyDBhxH9he). Despite the\nfact that the form mentions one particular target (Realchems), the attackers used the same\n\n\n-----\n\nfake form in the samples injected into the source code of the other two target websites.\n\n_Fig. 4: Fake payment form, which opens in an iframe element_\n\nWhile analyzing the source code of the fake payment form (Figure 5) Group-IB Threat\nIntelligence researchers found that it was saved from the Realchems website using\nSingleFile browser extension. For each saved page SingleFile creates a comment with the\nURL address of the page and the saved date using Date() JavaScript object. In this case the\ncomment contains the text in Korean \"그리니치 표준시\" (Greenwich Mean Time), which\nindicates that the page was saved on the device with Korean locale.\n\n_Fig. 5: Source code of fake payment form with Korean text_\n\n**Analysis of BTC transactions**\n\nThe four cryptocurrency addresses extracted from the Lazarus BTC Changer samples used\nby the attackers to receive stolen funds are:\n\n0x460ab1c34e4388704c5e56e18D904Ed117D077CC\n1Gf8U7UQEJvMXW5k3jtgFATWUmQXVyHkJt\n1MQC6C4FVX8RhmWESWsazEb5dyDBhxH9he\n1DjyE7WUCz9DLabw5EWAuJVpUzXfN4evta\n\n\n-----\n\nGroup-IB analyzed the transactions associated with the BTC addresses controlled by\nLazarus and discovered that the adversaries most likely used CoinPayments.net. An\nanalysis of money transfers from the attackers' BTC addresses, extracted from the Lazarus\nBTC Changer samples, to the address 35dnPpcXMGEoWE1gerDoC5xS92SYCQ61y6\nrevealed three transactions to BTC wallets allegedly owned by CoinPayments.net.\nCoinPayments.net is a payment gateway that allows users to conduct transactions involving\nBitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies. As such, Lazarus may have used it\nto facilitate cryptocurrency exchanges and transfers to external cryptocurrency addresses.\nThe website's KYC (Know Your Customer) policy could theoretically help identify individuals\nbehind these attacks.\n**ANALYSIS OF WALLETS**\n\nAt the time of withdrawing cryptocurrency from the extracted BTC addresses, the attackers\ntransferred 0.89993859 BTC ($8,446,55 at the moment of the transaction and $52,611 as of\nApril 9, 2021). The two main BTC addresses\n(1Gf8U7UQEJvMXW5k3jtgFATWUmQXVyHkJt and\n**1MQC6C4FVX8RhmWESWsazEb5dyDBhxH9he) used to steal funds received 43**\ntransactions while the Lazarus BTC Changer campaign was active. The address\n1DjyE7WUCz9DLabw5EWAuJVpUzXfN4evta was not active during the Lazarus BTC\nChanger campaign because there were only one incoming and one outgoing transactions\nassociated with this address on January 7, 2020, two months before the Lazarus BTC\nChanger campaign began. The ETH address received 29 incoming transactions, with a total\nprofit of 4.384719 ETH, ($9,047 as of April 9, 2021). This ETH address had been active\nsince July 11, 2019, however, and could have been used during other operations conducted\nby the hackers. It is therefore impossible to determine the transactions which resulted from\nthe Lazarus BTC Changer campaign.\n\n**ANALYSIS OF OUTGOING BTC TRANSACTIONS**\n\nWe tracked all outgoing transactions from the BTC addresses used by the attackers and\nextracted from Lazarus BTC Changer samples. We found that all stolen funds were\ntransferred to a single address (35dnPpcXMGEoWE1gerDoC5xS92SYCQ61y6) as a result\nof transaction a929c7\n(https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/a929c7d3b7ae58eb5b833460017016267f7ac66cbd16ad0\nb4c4d4c9b3f50406a). From this point onward, we used a short form of transaction IDs\ninstead of full IDs because of the length. Let's take a look at how all funds were transferred\nbefore this transaction.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig. 6: Transactions from the BTC addresses used by the attackers before withdrawal in the_\n_transaction a929c7_\n\nThe address 1DjyE7WUCz9DLabw5EWAuJVpUzXfN4evta was used in two Lazarus BTC\nChanger samples, but in this case the attackers were not successful: while samples with this\nBTC address were detected in late March 2020, all the funds from this address were\ntransferred on January 7, 2020, which means that either the attackers did not receive any\nmoney using samples involving this address, or the funds from this address were transferred\nafter the previous attacks. However, in January 2020 all the funds from this address were\ntransferred during transaction d64045\n(https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/d64045015d066aaa0187e822eebbe25437785d5c56be1a\n3fdcf3b77e99d324a7) to addresses 3Gud3MyyNyJvUEfaqvF3dYnYUGvxYGhvzb (which,\naccording to multiple wallet explorers, helps attribute wallets and transactions to particular\ncrypto services; this address is part of CoinPayments.net) and\n15ddzs7zA59cNt3m2YsErRzVamueWTTkTZ, which was one of the source addresses in\ntransaction a929c7.\n\nThe address 1MQC6C4FVX8RhmWESWsazEb5dyDBhxH9he was found in four samples\nused in the Lazarus BTC Changer campaign, including three samples which used fake\niframe payment forms. On April 5, 2020 the funds from this address were transferred to two\naddresses as part of transaction 5b3b34\n(https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/5b3b34e8fdb642b028361799df5ac3955f38653f746f98c67\n183b2c62dbfb9ef): 3JnxmN6aCwhPc1cWd17ka6n7KFNbiYYRiz (which, according to\nmultiple wallet explorers, is part of CoinPayments.net) and large part of the funds was sent\nto 1MrYhKvRiScuFPRb9ybuJzrrGX8BzR9u9r. Five days later on April 10, 2020 the funds\nfrom 1MrYhKvRiScuFPRb9ybuJzrrGX8BzR9u9r were sent again as part of transaction\n\n\n-----\n\na305ae\n(https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/a305aee9b7916ae34cefe9d3b2665271e027af52fdf57d6e\n4d3e02658760e456) to one of supposed CoinPayments.net addresses\n(3A6BbxFAYGj4zgcbBUatLeVxvqSDV4nQfV) and a large part of the funds was sent to\n1HDMJ42anvW97ib2awZkzSQsCjR7uxLD79, which was one of source addresses during the\nmain withdrawal of the stolen funds.\n\nThe address 1Gf8U7UQEJvMXW5k3jtgFATWUmQXVyHkJt used in one of the malware\nsamples was the most closely connected with the main withdrawal in transaction a929c7:\nthis address was one of the source addresses for this transaction.\nBesides these three transfers from the addresses used by the attackers, there was a fourth\nBTC address, which was the source in transaction a929c7\n**1KYjujKXcXw9mPrCr5HadY2DWCmo6aMrY9. However, we did not identify any malware**\nsamples or other malicious activity associated with this address and other related addresses.\nDuring the investigation, we identified three transactions as part of which a small part of the\nfunds was transferred to BTC addresses presumably owned by CoinPayments.net\naccording to multiple public wallet explorers. Based on this pattern, we can suppose that\nattackers possibly use CoinPayments.net as a payment gateway and a small part of funds in\neach of these transactions is the website's commission for payment.\nDuring transaction a929c7, the funds were sent to the address\n**35dnPpcXMGEoWE1gerDoC5xS92SYCQ61y6 on May 17, 2020 at 00:03. Thirty-four**\nminutes later, the funds from this address were transferred to two BTC addresses as part of\ntransaction 8ad539\n(https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/8ad539d33b3a9bcbc777ff252eb125c389d761c491750b4\n2ef2d67d90047337d): the larger part was sent to\n**bc1qhs5extg53a44wcj9kfuvjvnqnv3dhpsadacttd and the other part to**\nbc1qkjx7gm7enumq7ektxyk54l7zww45fxsk25eggw. From the\n**addressbc1qhs5extg53a44wcj9kfuvjvnqnv3dhpsadacttd, the funds were sent to other**\ntwo addresses as part of transaction 6acd59\n(https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/6acd5930f026c8163c1a742b7229acbceff7f9d317b9328f5\n736476e5f6b5692): 0.45641878 BTC to 38r5HQigv4Yh5ETwhYV8HwZwBbvThwSmfH and\n0.38125138 BTC to 1FWhm95L6Nh2eqKKS5uKsXeAFeYB4yHegm.\n\nFurther investigation didn't provide any useful connections between the BTC addresses and\npublic cryptocurrency services, so it is unclear where the funds were subsequently\ntransferred.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig. 7: Transactions after withdrawal from all BTC addresses used by the attackers_\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGroup-IB researchers identified a previously undocumented campaign: Lazarus BTC\nChanger, attributed to the North Korean hacker group called Lazarus. The campaign marks\nthe first time that Lazarus used malicious JS-sniffers to steal cryptocurrency. As part of the\ncampaign, Lazarus used the same infrastructure as in the clientToken= campaign (described\nby Sansec researchers) and a modified version of the clientToken= JavaScript sniffer.\nCombined with the gang's track record of going after crypto, the campaign makes it possible\nto attribute the attacks to Lazarus with a high level of confidence.\n\nGroup-IB Threat Intelligence team identified a supposed payment gateway that was used in\nseveral transactions involving the stolen funds. The website's KYC policies can theoretically\nhelp identify individuals behind the Lazarus BTC Changer campaign.\n\nGroup-IB researchers believe that after the gang successfully tested new tools on small ecommerce stores, it will be able to switch to more prominent targets for bigger gains.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n- To improve your visibility into the operations of threat actors carrying out JS sniffer attacks,\nstay up-to-date with their latest TTPs, and receive unique data about adversary activity for\n[threat hunting you may use Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution.](https://www.group-ib.com/intelligence-attribution.html)\n\n- Use complex and unique passwords to access the website's admin panel and any services\nused for administration, for example phpMyAdmin, Adminer. If possible, set up two-factor\nauthentication.\n\n\n-----\n\n- Install all necessary updates for the software used, including CMS of websites. Do not use\noutdated or unsupported versions of the CMS. This will help to reduce the risk of servers\nbeing compromised and make it more difficult for an attacker to download the web shell and\ninstall malicious code.\n\n- Regularly check the store for malware and conduct regular security audits of your website.\nFor example, for websites based on CMS Magento, you can use Magento Security Scan\nTool.\n\n- Conduct **[complex security assessment of your website to discover all possible](https://www.group-ib.com/security-assessment.html)**\nvulnerabilities, get information about existing exploits, and receive in-depth\nrecommendations to eliminate them.\n\n- Use the appropriate systems to log all changes that occur on the website, as well as to log\naccess to the website's control panel and database and track file change dates. This will help\nyou to detect website files infected with malicious code, as well as track unauthorized access\nto the website or web server.\n\n[Lear more about Group-IB's Security Assessment,](https://www.group-ib.com/security-assessment.html) [Threat Intelligence & Attribution, and](https://www.group-ib.com/intelligence-attribution.html)\n[Fraud Hunting Platform on our](https://www.group-ib.com/fraud-hunting-platform.html) [website.](https://www.group-ib.com/)\n**Indicators of compromise**\n\n**Samples**\n\n51043929f82412a87be8fc315f73c0fc41dd46ae8e45d3e427d03df9dbe8c9e5\nc8f27cf9b6fe3de41642c75f64ce955a094a646d907ca2937534ec0d81bdd6d1\nfb3f47bbd5fe5b7a89f7305688823cd7b986693eeae3a26bcdaf94c318a8bcd3\n\n\n-----\n\nd36a330038c7ec5b04c6e5da42071083d87806447b2236fcaa964bfef302a82b\n06ac32672777f4b7b3e890a9afabde9af3fee85c8d8a83429c5fadd04c298309\n79570a46d94301c0b89a8fd0539b0770bc375829b1c42d1ee8e0d4b7b44f8f7c\ne889dc3c95d160c30d675351e6ba1050e0d2ef04ce0b6074277c422a215e932e\n\n**Network indicators**\n\nluxmodelagency[.]com\n\n**Cryptocurrency addresses**\n\n0x460ab1c34e4388704c5e56e18D904Ed117D077CC\n1Gf8U7UQEJvMXW5k3jtgFATWUmQXVyHkJt\n1MQC6C4FVX8RhmWESWsazEb5dyDBhxH9he\n1DjyE7WUCz9DLabw5EWAuJVpUzXfN4evta\nShare\n\nReceive insights on the latest cybercrime trends\n\n\n-----",
