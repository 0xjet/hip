It was just a matter of time until cyber-criminals started to\ntrick users into installing tainted video-conferencing apps to capitalize on the expanded pool\nof users.\n\n## Malicious Zoom clones for the unaware\n\nZoom has been in the spotlight lately as one of the booming applications for video\nconferencing, despite its issues with end-to-end encryption and liberalized data sharing with\nFacebook. It did not take long for cyber-criminals to re-package it, disseminate it on thirdparty markets and wait for new victims to install it. The samples documented in this article\nspread outside of the Google Play Store and exclusively target users who sideload\napplications on their Droids.\n\n_Analyzed sample: 30a1a22dcf7fa0b62809f510a43829b1_\n\n_Packagename: us.zoom.videomeetings_\n\n_Detection: Android.Trojan.Downloader.UJ_\n\n_App label: Zoom_\n\nThis piece of malware has components injected in the repackaged Zoom application, as\nshown in figure 1 below.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the user interface is identical with the original application, it comes with extra\n“functionality” that the user did not sign up for. The malware tries to download its main\npayload from a command-and-control infrastructure\nat tcp[:]//googleteamsupport[.]ddns.net:4444\n\nThe choice of domains is likely not random, as it could indicate what the attackers might\ntarget next (the Google TeamSupport application is a business-to-business collaborative\nplatform that is also surging during the COVID-19 isolation).\n\n——————————————————————————————————————–\n\n_Update (04/01/2020): We have investigated the googleteamsupport[.]ddns.net domain and_\n_uncovered some interesting historical details._\n\n\n-----\n\n_This is a dynamic DNS service that allows an user with a dynamic IP address to map it to a_\n_subdomain, so they can offer a service without interruption, even when their dynamic IP_\n_address changes._\n\n_Our domain history shows that this subdomain was pointed at an IP address in Jordan_\n_(92.253.77.106) that seems to also have resolved sweetman2020[.]no-ip[].biz._\n\n_We were able to link the sweetman2020 subdomain as a command and control server for_\n_SandoRAT / DroidJack, an Android remote access tool. Last year, security researcher_\n_[Dancho Danchev also linked this subdomain to several targeted attacks using remote](https://ddanchev.blogspot.com/2019/09/massive-portfolio-of-apt-advanced.html)_\n_access tools._\n\n——————————————————————————————————————–\n\nThe sample has the same package name as the original Zoom application and the\ndevelopers have taken even subtle measures to keep the Certificate details as close as\npossible to the original Zoom app.\n\n## Aggressive adware gangs can’t miss the show\n\nBitdefender researchers have also uncovered a tainted Zoom APK that specifically targets\nChinese users. Once sideloaded, the application asks for phone, location and photo\npermissions on start.\n\nAnalyzed sample: fb5243138a920129dd85bb0e1545c2be\n\nPackagename: us.zoom.videomeetings\n\nDetection: Android Adware Downloader BC\n\n\n-----\n\nApp label: Zoom\nTargets: China\n\nWhen the victim taps the app icon, the application either does nothing, or it briefly displays\nan ad before closing itself.\n\nThe piece of code below shows that the main activity is transparent:\n```\n<activity android:name=\"com.kdssa.sdk.csj.SplashActivity\"\nandroid:theme=\"@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar\"> <intent-filter> <action\nandroid:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\"/> <category\nandroid:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\"/> </intent-filter> </activity>\n\n```\nAs soon as the app opens, a native ad is loaded and displayed on the screen for just a\nsecond.\n\nWhen the application finally starts, the victim is presented with ads as soon as they try to\nJoin a Meeting. They will keep receiving these ads until they press the X button.\n\nThe APK we analyzed retrieves adware info from:\nhttps[:]//sf3-ttcdn-tos.pstatp[.]com/obj/ad-pattern/renderer/package.json (the sf3 prefix part\nis different across various apps with the same SDK)\n```\n{“name”:”ad-pattern-renderer”,”version”:”1.0.124″,”main”:”https[:]//sf3-ttcdntos.pstatp][.]com/obj/ad-pattern/renderer/99093f/index.html”,”resources”:\n[{“url”:”https[:]//sf3-ttcdn-tos.pstatp[.]com/obj/adpattern/renderer/99093f/index.html”,”md5″:”f0d70a91b5035cd0a11b99fe8182ca42″,”level”:\n{“url”:”https[:]//sf3-ttcdn-tos.pstatp[.]com/obj/adpattern/renderer/99093f/index.js”,”md5″:”0f4eeff8f4ebfa230471c43dbf2e8bae”,”level”:1}\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nHardcoded links:\n\nhttp[:]//sf3-ttcdn-tos[.]pstatp.com/\n\n## More Zoom badware\n\nThis is another malicious sample that attempts to impersonate the Zoom application and\nlure victims into installing it.\n\nAnalyzed sample: 9930b683d4b31a3398da0fb75c27d056\n\nPackagename: app.z1_android_421120320_app_original_file\n\nDetection: Android.Trojan.HiddenAds.AJR\n\nApp label: ZOOM Cloud Meetings\n\nWhen opened, the application initially hides itself from the menu. It then starts a repeating\nalarm that randomly sends an intent to an Ad Service. This service subsequently starts an\nAdActivity that opens an ad. The link can be found in the resources: adsforapp1[.]com\n\nThe malicious app proceeds with checking for another hard-coded string in assets, called\n‘admin’. If the string is true, it asks for device admin rights. If the value is set to false (as in\nour case), it tries to download another file (the apk entry).\n\nWhen opened, the app redirects to download the extra component.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs of the moment of writing, this sample has been seen in the wild in the United States.\n\nThe sample bundles functionality to ask for device admin permissions in English or\nRussian, based on the default language of the mobile phone. The malware also has the\nability to start itself when the device is powered on.\n\n_[Bitdefender Mobile Security for Android detects and blocks these applications as](https://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/mobile-security-android.html)_\n_Android.Trojan.Downloader.UJ, Android.Adware.Downloader.BC and_\n_Android.Trojan.HiddenAds.AJR. In order to minimize risks of getting compromised, Android_\n\n\n-----\n\n_users are advised to install a security solution and to limit their downloads to vendor-_\n_recommended application stores._\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[anti-malware research](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/antimalware-research/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Oana ASOLTANEI\n\nOana Asoltanei is a Security Researcher at Bitdefender.
