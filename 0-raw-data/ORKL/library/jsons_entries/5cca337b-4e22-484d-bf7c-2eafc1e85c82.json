PlugX has been used in a number of attacks since first being discovered in 2012, and\n[we have published several articles related to its use, including an analysis of an](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/plugx/) attack campaign targeting Japanese\ncompanies.\n\nElirks, less widely known than PlugX, is a basic backdoor Trojan, first discovered in 2010, that is primarily used to\nsteal information from compromised systems. We mostly observe attacks using Elirks occurring in East Asia. One of\nthe unique features of the malware is that it retrieves its C2 address by accessing a pre-determined microblog\nservice or SNS. Attackers create accounts on those services and post encoded IP addresses or the domain names\nof real C2 servers in advance of distributing the backdoor. We have seen multiple Elirks variants using Japanese\nblog services for the last couple of years. Figure 1 shows embedded URL in an Elirks sample found in early 2016.\n\n_Figure 1 Embedded URLs in Elirks variant_\n\nIn another sample found in 2014, an attacker used a Japanese blog service. The relevant account still exists at the\ntime of writing this article (Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Blog account created by the attacker in 2014_\n\n**Link to previous attack campaign**\n\nUnit 42 previously identified an Elirks variant during our analysis of the attack campaign called [Scarlet Mimic. It is](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/research/scarlet-mimic)\nyears-long campaign targeting minority rights activists and governments. The malware primarily used in this series\nof attacks was FakeM. Our researchers described the threat sharing infrastructure with Elirks in the report.\n\nAs of this writing, we can note similarities between previously seen Elirks attacks and this recent case in Japan.\n\n**Spear Phishing Email with PDF attachment**\n\nFigure 3 shows an email which was sent to a ministry of Taiwan in May 2012.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Spear Phishing Email sent to a ministry of Taiwan_\n\nThe email characteristics were bit similar to the recent case (Table 1).\n\n2012 2016\n\n\nEmail\nSender\n\nEmail\nRecipient\n\n\nMasquerades as an existing bank in Taiwan Masquerade as an existing aviation company in\nJapan\n\n\nRepresentative email address of a ministry of\nTaiwan, which is publicly available.\n\n\nRepresentative email address of a subsidiary\ncompany, which is publicly available.\n\n\nSubject “Bank credit card statement” in Chinese “Airline E-Ticket” in Japanese\n\n\nAttachment PDF file named “Electronic Billing\n\n1015” in Chinese\n\n_Table 1 Email characteristics_\n\n\nFile named “E-TKT” in Japanese with PDF icon\n\n\nWhen a user opened the attached PDF file, the following message is displayed. It exploits a vulnerability in Adobe\nFlash, CVE-2011-0611 embedded in the PDF and installs Elirks malware on the system.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 opening malicious PDF attachment_\n\n**Airline E-Ticket**\n\nAttackers choose a suitable file name to lure targeted individual or organization. In the recent case, the malicious\nattachment name in the email was reported as “E-TKT”. We found similar file name in the previous attack in Taiwan\nin August 2012 (Figure 5).\n\n_Figure 5 Elirks executable file masquerade as folder of E-Ticket_\n\nWhen opening the file, Elirks executes itself on the computer and creates ticket.doc to deceive users (Figure 6).\n\n_Figure 6 doc file created by Elirks_\n\nWe’ve also seen another file name related to aviation at Taiwan in March 2012. Figure 7 shows PDF file named\n“Airline Reservation Numbers (updated version).pdf”. When opening the PDF file, it displays the exactly same\nmessage with the Figure4, exploits CVE-2011-0611 and installs Elirks.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCurrently, we have found no reliable evidence to indicate\nthe same adversary attacked a company in Japan in 2016\nand multiple organizations in Taiwan in 2012. However, we\ncan see some resemblances between the two attacks. In\nboth cases, attackers used the same malware family,\ncrafted spear phishing emails in a similar manner, and\nseem to be interested in some areas related to aviation. We\nhave been seeing multiple Elirks variants targeting Japan in\nthe last few years, potentially indicating an ongoing cyber\nespionage campaign. We will keep an eye on the threat\nactors.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from Elirks\nvariant and can gather additional information using the\nfollowing tools:\n\nWildFire detects all known Elirks samples as malicious\n\nAll known C2s are classified as malicious in PAN-DB\n\n[AutoFocus tags have been created: Elirks](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Elirks)\n\n## Indicators:\n\n**Executable File:**\n\n8587e3a0312a6c4374989cbcca48dc54ddcd3fbd54b48833afda991a6a2dfdea\n\n0e317e0fee4eb6c6e81b2a41029a9573d34cebeabab6d661709115c64526bf95\n\nf18ddcacfe4a98fb3dd9eaffd0feee5385ffc7f81deac100fdbbabf64233dc68\n\n**Delivery PDF:**\n\n755138308bbaa9fcb9c60f0b089032ed4fa1cece830a954ad574bd0c2fe1f104\n\n200a4708afe812989451f5947aed2f30b8e9b8e609a91533984ffa55d02e60a2\n\n\n-----",
