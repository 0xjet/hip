This prompted\nthe company to take offline all its computer systems, a precaution meant \"to protect data\nand prevent the spread of the virus.\"\n\nAs a result, customers could no longer use the website or the app for transactions or make\npayments using credit or debit cards at its more than 1,500 stores across the world.\nHundreds of customer complaints came pouring in via social media since the outage began.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn [replies to customers today, Travelex was unable to provide updates about progress on](https://twitter.com/TravelexUK/status/1214183366712528898)\nrestoring its services. In the meantime, the company shows a cyber incident notification on\nthe main page of its website and \"planned maintenance\" on other pages.\n\n## All network locked, files stolen\n\nOn January 3, ComputerWeekly magazine received inside information that the Londonbased foreign currency exchange company fell victim to a ransomware attack, albeit the\nmalware family remained unknown.\n\n[The same news outlet today reported that the ransomware used in the Travelex attack is](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252476283/Cyber-gangsters-demand-payment-from-Travelex-after-Sodinokibi-attack)\nSodinokibi.\n\nBleepingComputer was able to independently confirm that Travelex systems were indeed\ninfected by REvil ransomware. We were told that the extension added to some of the\nencrypted files was a string of more than five random characters, similar to .u3i7y74. This\nmalware typically adds different extensions to files locked on other computer systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to the ransom note, the Sodinokibi crew told BleepingComputer that they\nencrypted the entire Travelex network and copied more than 5GB of personal data, which\nincludes dates of birth, social security numbers, card information and other details.\n\nWe were told that they deleted the backup files and that the ransom demanded was $3\nmillion; if not paid in seven days (countdown likely started on December 31), the attackers\nsaid they will publish the data they stole.\n\n## Travelex left the door open\n\nDetails about how the intrusion occurred are not available at the moment but Travelex was\nrunning insecure services before the incident, which could explain how the attacker may\nhave breached the network.\n\nThe company is using the Pulse Secure VPN enterprise solution for secure communication,\nwhich was patched last year against an \"incredibly bad\" vulnerability (CVE-2019-11510), as\nsecurity researcher Kevin Beaumont describes it in a recent blog post.\n\nOn unpatched systems, the flaw \"allows people without valid usernames and passwords to\nremotely connect to the corporate network the device is supposed to protect, turn off multifactor authentication controls, remotely view logs and cached passwords in plain text\n[(including Active Directory account passwords),\" Beaumont explains.](https://doublepulsar.com/big-game-ransomware-being-delivered-to-organisations-via-pulse-secure-vpn-bd01b791aad9)\n\nA [public exploit for this has been available since August 21, 2019. Soon after, someone](https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Security_Advisories/SA44101/)\nstarted scanning the internet for vulnerable endpoints.\n\nTroy Mursch, chief research officer at Bad Packets, found about 15,000 systems that were\ndirectly exploitable via this security issue. Mursch then started to contact organizations at\nrisk, warning them about the danger of leaving their systems unpatched.\n\nTravelex was one of the companies Mursch alerted of the issue but he did not get a reply:\n\n\n-----\n\nsource: [Bad Packets Report](https://twitter.com/bad_packets/status/1213536922825420800)\nAttackers typically spend significant time on the network before deploying the ransomware\nand encrypting files. This is to get familiar with the network and find systems with important\ndata and backups, to increase their chances of getting paid.\n\nFurthermore, Kevin Beaumont discovered that Travelex had on its Amazon cloud platform\nWindows servers that were exposed to the internet and did not have the Network Level\nAuthentication feature enables. This means that anyone could connect to the server before\nauthenticating.\n\n\n-----\n\nsource: [Kevin Beaumont](https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1212874282596012032)\n**Update [06/01/2020, 18:26 EST]: Pulse Secure issued a statement today about**\nransomware actors exploiting unpatched VPN servers. The company is not validating any\nrecent findings as it does not have any data about the attacks.\n\n\"As of now, we are unaware of receiving reports directly from customers about this\nderivative exploit – no firsthand evidence,\" Pulse Secure told BleepingComputer.\n\nThe current communication underlines that a patch for the software is available since April\n24, 2019, and that customers were informed multiple times about the fix, via emails, inproduct and support website notifications.\n\n\"Actors will take advantage of the vulnerability that was reported on Pulse Secure, Fortinet\nand Palo Alto VPN products – and in this case, exploit unpatched VPN servers to propagate\nmalware, REvil (Sodinokibi), by distributing and activating the Ransomware through\ninteractive prompts of the VPN interface to the users attempting to access resources\nthrough unpatched, vulnerable Pulse VPN servers.\" Scott Gordon (CISSP), Pulse Secure\nChief Marketing Officer.\n\n\n-----\n\nSince the release of the patch, support engineers have been available 24x7 for customers\nneeding help to solve the problem, including those not under an active maintenance\ncontract.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Karakurt revealed as data extortion arm of Conti cybercrime syndicate](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/karakurt-revealed-as-data-extortion-arm-of-conti-cybercrime-syndicate/)\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Extortion](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/extortion/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Sodinokibi](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/sodinokibi/)\n[Travelex](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/travelex/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
