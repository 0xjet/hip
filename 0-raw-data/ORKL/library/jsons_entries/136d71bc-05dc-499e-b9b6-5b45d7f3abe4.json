This cybercrime campaign is focused mainly on the\ntheft of cryptocurrency wallets, and we estimate that the attackers have already made off with hundreds\nof millions of dollars.\n\nThis campaign was also reported by additional companies and organizations, including JPCERT/CC[1],\nNTT Security[2] and F-SECURE[3]. The campaign is also known as CryptoMimic, Dangerous Password and\nLeery Turtle.\n\nIn our report we attributed this campaign to a specific actor – North Korea’s LAZARUS APT Group. This\nattribution is a result of two stages of research:\n\n  - First stage– connecting all research documents to the same campaign: a comparative study of\nall the research documents trying to prove they are all referring to the same campaign.\n\n  - Second stage – Attribution to Lazarus: We adopted F-SECURE’s attribution to LAZARUS. Then we\nreaffirmed this attribution by comparing the attack tools found in this campaign to other\nLazarus campaigns and found strong similarities.\n\nOur research shows a MEDIUM-HIGH likelihood that Lazarus group, a North-Korean, state-sponsored\nAPT group, is attacking crypto exchanges all over the world and in Israel for at least three years. This\ngroup is has successfully hacked into numerous companies and organizations around the world for\nmany years. Until recently this group was not known to attack Israeli targets.\n\nWe would like to thank NTT Security Japan for sharing malware samples with us, and for their feedback\non this research.\n\n1 https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2019/07/spear-phishing-against-cryptocurrency-businesses.html\n2 https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-Takai-etal.pdf\n3 https://labs.f-secure.com/assets/BlogFiles/f-secureLABS-tlp-white-lazarus-threat-intel-report2.pdf\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2021 All rights reserved to ClearSky Ltd.

The group’s focus is mainly espionage, political attacks (anti-US and anti-South\nKorea, mostly) and financial, especially cryptocurrency wallets attack. According to the FBI this group is\nstate-sponsored and is a part of North Korea’s RGB intelligence agency.\n\n#### CryptoCore - An Attack Campaign Targeting Israeli Crypto- Exchanges\n\nOn June 2020, we released a detailed report about a three-year-old campaign targeting cryptoexchanges in Israel, US, Europe, and Japan by unknown group which we dubbed CryproCore[4] campaign.\nWe also identified that the attackers behind this campaign stole millions of dollars’ worth of\ncryptocurrency wallets.\n\nWhile at the time, we did not attribute this campaign, our initial hypothesis was that this group is of\nRussian or other eastern-European origin.\n\nParallel to our report, other cybersecurity firms released research papers describing similar attacks:\n\n  - A report by F-SECURE which reviewed a large-scale, international campaign found while\ninvestigating attacks on crypto wallets. According to the research paper, the attackers started a\nconversation with their targets and convinced them to download a malicious file. The paper\nshowed an analysis of the malwares used in the attack and outlined similarities between them\nand between malwares known to be used by LAZARUS.\n\n  - A report by the Japanese CERT JPCERT/CC which gave an analysis of several incidents where\nemployees of Japanese firms were contacted and convinced to download malicious files. The\nreport gave no further information about the affected parties but gave some technical\ninformation about the malware used for the attack.\n\n  - A report by the Japanese cybersecurity firm NTT SECURITY which points to a campaign they\ndubbed CRYPTOMIMIC. According to the report, large sums of money were stolen from crypto\nwallets by contacting users and convincing them to download malicious files. The report\ncontained information about the attack’s modus operandi, as well as a technical analysis of the\nmalware used.\n\n4 https://www.ClearSkysec.com/cryptocore-group /\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2021 All rights reserved to ClearSky Ltd.

By comparing these\nresearch papers, we found that they share:\n\n  - A large number of IoC’s\n\n  - A VBS script used for communication with C&C servers.\n\nOur working hypothesis is that since all three papers share many varied IoCs (domains, IPs, Files etc.) as\nwell as the same VBS script, then they all point to the same attack campaign.\n\n1. Comparison of indicators (IOC’s) between ClearSky’s and F-Secure’s research:\n\nThe following 40 IOC’s were all found in both the ClearSky and F-SECURE papers:\n\nIdentical IOC’s in both ClearSky’s and F-SECURE’s research\n\nd7b8c3c986495a814c9b8bd10d3f5eef googledrive.network\n\ncd0a391331c1d4268bd622080ba68bce googledrive.email\n\ndb3c54038e0b2db2c058a5e9761e4819 googleexplore.net\n\nee15bec0e9ba39f186d721515efd6a00 googledrive.online\n\nd3d32225bf893ccc62dee9d833fe04f2 googledrive.download\n\n45123dac5e13cebe1dc7fc95afd9c63e uploadsfiles.xyz\n\n3e9b52e3b90ac45ac5ddb9c91615c7ae msupdatepms.xyz\n\nb8406b91b0eb57267f192a1aee6d3ee0 onedrivems.online\n\nfeccea47b97e78f2d6c4271da3f565c4 drivegooglshare.xyz\n\n7d5c259d422310218a8888ec1ce65e92 1driv.org\n\nc869b0fe739d0626e4474eea980dd018 cloudfiles.club\n\n83bac6075fe0d21eea6c9942b2738a1e onedriveupdate.publicvm.com\n\nc5d9a6478b9b68c213301cb81cbd3833 twosigma.publicvm.com\n\nc509890d250d6e986e3c3654aa5cea26 drivegoogle.publicvm.com\n\n17d97dca939836fe4eeb61eac371960f googleupdate.publicvm.com\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2021 All rights reserved to ClearSky Ltd.

Comparison of indicators (IOC’s) between ClearSky’s and JPCERT/CC’s research:\n\nThe following six IOC’s were all found in both the ClearSky and JPCERT/CC papers:\n\n\nIdentical IOC's in both ClearSky’s and\n\n\nJPCERT/CC’s researches\na9c5355fce2bd42e5cb3cd1fe6c375f1\n\ndrivegoogle.publicvm.com\n\ngoogledrive.email\n\ngoogledrive.network\n\ngoogledrive.publicvm.com\n\nmskpupdate.publicvm.com\n\n3. Comparison of VBS scripts found in ClearSky’s and F-SECURE’s research:\n\nAs part of ClearSky’s CryptoCore research, we uncovered a VBS script used for connecting the\nattacked system with C&C servers and awaiting instructions. A nearly identical script was\npresented as part of F-SECURE’s research. Here are the two scripts, un-obfuscated, side by side:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2021 All rights reserved to ClearSky Ltd.

Send a request to the first argument passed to the script on runtime with the string:\n\n?topic=s[random-digits] .\n2. Start infinite loop:\n\na. Wait for response.:\n\ni. If response was returned, attempt to run it.\nii. If response was not returned, wait three minutes.\n\n4. Comparison of VBS script between ClearSky and JPCERT/CC:\n\nA reference is made in JPCERT/CC’s report to a very similar script, which operates in the same\nfashion and has the same parameters:\n\n5. CONCLUSION\n\nGiven the large amount of similar IOC’s and a virtually identical VBS script all found in ClearSky’s,\nF-SECURE’s and JPCERT/CC’s research papers, we can assume it is highly probable they are all\nreferring to the same attack campaign.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2021 All rights reserved to ClearSky Ltd.

To\nclearly say they are related, we searched for similarities between the RAT and STEALER tools found in\nNTT SECURITY’s and F-SECURE’s research papers. Our working hypothesis is that if the different\nmalwares display many similarities, then NTT SECURITY’s research can also be said to relate to the same\nattack campaign.\n\n1.

This strengthens the hypothesis that these tools were created by the same\nactors.\n\nHere is an example of F-SECURE’s YARA rules signing the RAT from NTT SECURITY’s research\n(msoRAT):\n\n5. CONCLUSION\n\nGiven the similarities between F-SECURE’s and NTT-SECURITY’s RAT and STEALER in:\n\n      - File behavior\n\n      - Similarities in code\n\n      - Being signed by the same YARA rules\nWe can say with a high probability that NTT SECURITY’s research also deals with the same attack\ncampaign and attacker as the other three research papers. This means that all four research\npapers are about the same attack campaign.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2021 All rights reserved to ClearSky Ltd.

Attempting to apply F-SECURE’s\nbackdoor YARA rule to the findings from this report will not work, but only because the 2016 backdoor\naccesses a file named “scaeve.dat” while in newer versions that has been changed to “perflog.dat”.\nChanging the file’s name would cause the YARA rule to apply to the 2016 research as well.\n\nKaspersky\n\nWe can see that our test for applying YARA rules from F-SECURE’s research to ESET’s and KASPERSKY’s\nresearch worked, and highly strengthens the attribution of these attacks to LAZARUS.\n\nDuring our research, we located several indicative and uncommon traits for LAZARUS tools that were\npart of the attack campaign:\n\nSimilar traits for RAT:\n\n1. RAT is named ntuser.cat.\n2. Usage of the packers themida and VMProtect.\n3. Injection of malware to process explorer.exe, and potentially to other processes.\n4. RAT accesses file “msomain.sdb” and decrypts it. This file contains information of C&C servers.\n5. Base64 encoding in RAT’s code.\n6. Unique code in RAT and STEALER for RC4 encryption. This code has only ever been found in\n\nLAZARUS tools.\n7. Uniform malware command-parsing table, indicating the same RAT was used for several targets.\n8. Unique wrapper function for decrypting RC4 and Base64.\n\nSimilar traits for STEALER:\n\n1. Usage of the packers themida and VMProtect.\n2. Injection of malware to process lsass.exe, probably done to dump user passwords and steal\n\ndata.\n3. STEALER accesses file “msomain.sdb” and decrypts it. This file contains information of C&C\n\nservers.\n4. Unique code in RAT and STEALER for RC4 encryption. This code has only ever been found in\n\nLAZARUS tools.\n5.

However, it was possible to detect the VMProtect packer by viewing the sections within the\nsamples, as VMProtect creates two custom sections postfixed with ‘0’ and ‘1’.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBy being able to sign F-SECURE’s YARA rules to RATs associated with LAZARUS from ESET and\nKASPERSKY’s we have greatly strengthened F-SECURE’s attribution of the CryptoCore attack campaign to\nLAZARUS.\n\nIn addition, we have located several indicative and uncommon traits in these tools all associated with\nLAZARUS.\n\nThe above information means we can, with a high level of probability, attribute the CryptoCore attack\ncampaign to LAZARUS.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2021 All rights reserved to ClearSky Ltd.
