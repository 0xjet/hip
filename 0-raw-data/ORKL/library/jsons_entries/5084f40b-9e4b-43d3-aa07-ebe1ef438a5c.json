Notable attack vectors include Trickbot and\nCobalt Strike (see below for details).\nWhile there are no specific or credible cyber threats to the U.S. homeland at this time, CISA, FBI,\nNSA, and the United States Secret Service (USSS) encourage organizations to review this advisory\nand apply the recommended mitigations.\n(end of update)\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) have observed the increased use of Conti ransomware in more than 400 attacks on U.S. and\ninternational organizations. (See FBI Flash: Conti Ransomware Attacks Impact Healthcare and First\nResponder Networks.) In typical Conti ransomware attacks, malicious cyber actors steal files, encrypt\nservers and workstations, and demand a ransom payment.\n\nTo report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact\nyour local FBI field office at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices, or the FBI’s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) at\n855-292-3937 or by email at CyWatch@fbi.gov.

See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat actor\ntactics and techniques.\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nWhile Conti is considered a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model ransomware variant, there is\nvariation in its structure that differentiates it from a typical affiliate model. It is likely that Conti\ndevelopers pay the deployers of the ransomware a wage rather than a percentage of the proceeds\nfrom a successful attack.\nConti actors often gain initial access [TA0001] to networks through:\n•\n\nSpearphishing campaigns using tailored emails that contain malicious attachments\n[T1566.001] or malicious links [T1566.002];\no Malicious Word attachments often contain embedded scripts that can be used to\ndownload or drop other malware—such as TrickBot and IcedID, and/or Cobalt Strike—\nto assist with lateral movement and later stages of the attack life cycle with the\neventual goal of deploying Conti ransomware.[1],[2],[3]\n\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nStolen or weak Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials [T1078];[4]\nPhone calls;\nFake software promoted via search engine optimization;\nOther malware distribution networks (e.g., ZLoader); and\nCommon vulnerabilities in external assets.\n\nIn the execution phase [TA0002], actors run a getuid payload before using a more aggressive\npayload to reduce the risk of triggering antivirus engines. CISA and FBI have observed Conti actors\nusing Router Scan, a penetration testing tool, to maliciously scan for and brute force [T1110] routers,\ncameras, and network-attached storage devices with web interfaces. Additionally, actors use\nKerberos attacks [T1558.003] to attempt to get the Admin hash to conduct brute force attacks.\nConti actors are known to exploit legitimate remote monitoring and management software and remote\ndesktop software as backdoors to maintain persistence [TA0003] on victim networks.[5] The actors\nuse tools already available on the victim network—and, as needed, add additional tools such as\nWindows Sysinternals and Mimikatz—to obtain users’ hashes and clear-text credentials, which\nenable the actors to escalate privileges [TA0004] within a domain and perform other post-exploitation\nand lateral movement tasks [TA0008]. In some cases, the actors also use TrickBot malware to carry\nout post-exploitation tasks.\n\nPage 2 of 10 | Product ID: AA21-265A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA | USSS\n\nTLP:WHITE\nAccording to a recently leaked threat actor “playbook,”[6] Conti actors also exploit vulnerabilities in\nunpatched assets, such as the following, to escalate privileges [TA0004] and move laterally [TA0008]\nacross a victim’s network:\n•\n•\n•\n\n2017 Microsoft Windows Server Message Block 1.0 server vulnerabilities;[7]\n\"PrintNightmare\" vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) in Windows Print spooler service;[8] and\n\"Zerologon\" vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) in Microsoft Active Directory Domain Controller\nsystems.[9]\n\nArtifacts leaked with the playbook identify four Cobalt Strike server Internet Protocol (IP) addresses\nConti actors previously used to communicate with their command and control (C2) server.\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\n162.244.80[.]235\n85.93.88[.]165\n185.141.63[.]120\n82.118.21[.]1\n\nCISA and FBI have observed Conti actors using different Cobalt Strike server IP addresses unique to\ndifferent victims.\nConti actors often use the open-source Rclone command line program for data exfiltration [TA0010].\nAfter the actors steal and encrypt the victim's sensitive data [T1486], they employ a double extortion\ntechnique in which they demand the victim pay a ransom for the release of the encrypted data and\nthreaten the victim with public release of the data if the ransom is not paid.\n\nINDICATORS OF COMPROMISE\nUpdated March 9, 2022:\nThe following domains have registration and naming characteristics similar to domains used by\ngroups that have distributed Conti ransomware. Many of these domains have been used in malicious\noperations; however, some may be abandoned or may share similar characteristics coincidentally.\nDomains\nbadiwaw[.]com\n\nfipoleb[.]com\n\nkipitep[.]com\n\npihafi[.]com\n\ntiyuzub[.]com\n\nbalacif[.]com\n\nfofudir[.]com\n\nkirute[.]com\n\npilagop[.]com\n\ntubaho[.]com\n\nbarovur[.]com\n\nfulujam[.]com\n\nkogasiv[.]com\n\npipipub[.]com\n\nvafici[.]com\n\nbasisem[.]com\n\nganobaz[.]com\n\nkozoheh[.]com\n\npofifa[.]com\n\nvegubu[.]com\n\nbimafu[.]com\n\ngerepa[.]com\n\nkuxizi[.]com\n\nradezig[.]com\n\nvigave[.]com\n\nbujoke[.]com\n\ngucunug[.]com\n\nkuyeguh[.]com\n\nraferif[.]com\n\nvipeced[.]com\n\nbuloxo[.]com\n\nguvafe[.]com\n\nlipozi[.]com\n\nragojel[.]com\n\nvizosi[.]com\n\nbumoyez[.]com\n\nhakakor[.]com\n\nlujecuk[.]com\n\nrexagi[.]com\n\nvojefe[.]com\n\nbupula[.]com\n\nhejalij[.]com\n\nmasaxoc[.]com\n\nrimurik[.]com\n\nvonavu[.]com\n\nPage 3 of 10 | Product ID: AA21-265A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA | USSS\n\nTLP:WHITE\ncajeti[.]com\n\nhepide[.]com\n\nmebonux[.]com\n\nrinutov[.]com\n\nwezeriw[.]com\n\ncilomum[.]com\n\nhesovaw[.]com\n\nmihojip[.]com\n\nrusoti[.]com\n\nwideri[.]com\n\ncodasal[.]com\n\nhewecas[.]com\n\nmodasum[.]com\n\nsazoya[.]com\n\nwudepen[.]com\n\ncomecal[.]com\n\nhidusi[.]com\n\nmoduwoj[.]com\n\nsidevot[.]com\n\nwuluxo[.]com\n\ndawasab[.]com\n\nhireja[.]com\n\nmovufa[.]com\n\nsolobiv[.]com\n\nwuvehus[.]com\n\nderotin[.]com\n\nhoguyum[.]com\n\nnagahox[.]com\n\nsufebul[.]com\n\nwuvici[.]com\n\ndihata[.]com\n\njecubat[.]com\n\nnawusem[.]com\n\nsuhuhow[.]com\n\nwuvidi[.]com\n\ndirupun[.]com\n\njegufe[.]com\n\nnerapo[.]com\n\nsujaxa[.]com\n\nxegogiv[.]com\n\ndohigu[.]com\n\njoxinu[.]com\n\nnewiro[.]com\n\ntafobi[.]com\n\nxekezix[.]com\n\ndubacaj[.]com\n\nkelowuh[.]com\n\npaxobuy[.]com\n\ntepiwo[.]com\n\nfecotis[.]com\n\nkidukes[.]com\n\npazovet[.]com\n\ntifiru[.]com\n\n(End of update)\n\nMITRE ATT&CK TECHNIQUES\nConti ransomware uses the ATT&CK techniques listed in table 1.\nTable 1: Conti ATT&CK techniques for enterprise\nInitial Access\nTechnique Title\n\nID\n\nUse\n\nValid Accounts\n\nT1078\n\nConti actors have been observed gaining\nunauthorized access to victim networks\nthrough stolen Remote Desktop Protocol\n(RDP) credentials.\n\nPhishing: Spearphishing\nAttachment\n\nT1566.001\n\nConti ransomware can be delivered using\nTrickBot malware, which is known to use an\nemail with an Excel sheet containing a\nmalicious macro to deploy the malware.\n\nPhishing: Spearphishing\nLink\n\nT1566.002\n\nConti ransomware can be delivered using\nTrickBot, which has been delivered via\nmalicious links in phishing emails.\nExecution\n\nCommand and Scripting\nInterpreter: Windows\nCommand Shell\n\nT1059.003\n\nConti ransomware can utilize command line\noptions to allow an attacker control over how it\nscans and encrypts files.\n\nPage 4 of 10 | Product ID: AA21-265A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA | USSS\n\nTLP:WHITE\nNative Application\nProgramming Interface\n(API)\n\nT1106\n\nConti ransomware has used API calls during\nexecution.\nPersistence\n\nValid Accounts\n\nT1078\n\nConti actors have been observed gaining\nunauthorized access to victim networks\nthrough stolen RDP credentials.\n\nExternal Remote Services\n\nT1133\n\nAdversaries may leverage external-facing\nremote services to initially access and/or\npersist within a network. Remote services\nsuch as virtual private networks (VPNs), Citrix,\nand other access mechanisms allow users to\nconnect to internal enterprise network\nresources from external locations. There are\noften remote service gateways that manage\nconnections and credential authentication for\nthese services.

Define a demilitarized zone that eliminates unregulated\ncommunication between networks.\nFilter network traffic to prohibit ingress and egress communications with known malicious IP\naddresses.\nEnable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users. Implement a\nuser training program to discourage users from visiting malicious websites or opening\nmalicious attachments. Filter emails containing executable files to prevent them from reaching\nend users.\nImplement a URL blocklist and/or allowlist to prevent users from accessing malicious\nwebsites.\n\nScan for vulnerabilities and keep software updated.\n•\n•\n\nSet antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of network assets using up-todate signatures.\nUpgrade software and operating systems, applications, and firmware on network assets in a\ntimely manner. Consider using a centralized patch management system.\n\nRemove unnecessary applications and apply controls.\n•\n\nRemove any application not deemed necessary for day-to-day operations.

Implement software restriction policies (SRPs)\nor other controls to prevent programs from executing from common ransomware locations,\nsuch as temporary folders supporting popular internet browsers or\ncompression/decompression programs.\nImplement execution prevention by disabling macro scripts from Microsoft Office files\ntransmitted via email. Consider using Office Viewer software to open Microsoft Office files\ntransmitted via email instead of full Microsoft Office suite applications.\nSee the joint Alert, Publicly Available Tools Seen in Cyber Incidents Worldwide—developed by\nCISA and the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United\nKingdom—for guidance on detection and protection against malicious use of publicly available\ntools.\n\nImplement endpoint and detection response tools.\n•\n\nEndpoint and detection response tools allow a high degree of visibility into the security status\nof endpoints and can help effectively protect against malicious cyber actors.\n\nLimit access to resources over the network, especially by restricting RDP.\n•\n\nAfter assessing risks, if RDP is deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating\nsources and require multifactor authentication.\n\nSecure user accounts.\n•\n•\n\nRegularly audit administrative user accounts and configure access controls under the\nprinciples of least privilege and separation of duties.\nRegularly audit logs to ensure new accounts are legitimate users.\n\nReview CISA’s APTs Targeting IT Service Provider Customers guidance for additional mitigations\nspecific to IT Service Providers and their customers.\n\nUse the Ransomware Response Checklist in case of infection.\nIf a ransomware incident occurs at your organization, CISA, FBI, and NSA recommend the following\nactions:\n•\n•\n\nFollow the Ransomware Response Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA-Multi-State Information\nSharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.\nScan your backups. If possible, scan your backup data with an antivirus program to check\nthat it is free of malware.\n\nPage 8 of 10 | Product ID: AA21-265A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA | USSS\n\n•\n•\n\nTLP:WHITE\nReport incidents immediately to CISA at https://us-cert.cisa.gov/report, a local FBI Field\nOffice, or U.S. Secret Service Field Office.\nApply incident response best practices found in the joint Advisory, Technical Approaches\nto Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity, developed by CISA and the cybersecurity\nauthorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\nCISA, FBI, and NSA strongly discourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may\nembolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in\nthe distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not\nguarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered.\n\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nThe Digital Forensics, Incident Response (DFIR) Report: BazarLoader to Conti Ransomware\nin 32 Hours (September 2021): https://thedfirreport.com/2021/09/13/bazarloader-to-contiransomware-in-32-hours/\nNSA Cybersecurity Information Sheet: Transition to Multi-Factor Authentication (August 2019):\nhttps://media.defense.gov/2019/Sep/09/2002180346/-1/-1/0/Transition%20to%20Multifactor%20Authentication%20-%20Copy.pdf\nNSA Cybersecurity Information Sheet: Segment Networks and Deploy Application-Aware\nDefenses (September 2019): https://media.defense.gov/2019/Sep/09/2002180325/-1/1/0/Segment%20Networks%20and%20Deploy%20Application%20Aware%20Defenses%20%20Copy.pdf\nNSA Cybersecurity Information Sheet: Hardening Network Devices (August 2020):\nhttps://media.defense.gov/2020/Aug/18/2002479461/-1/1/0/HARDENING_NETWORK_DEVICES.PDF\n\nFree Cyber Hygiene Services\nCISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help organizations assess, identify, and\nreduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware.
