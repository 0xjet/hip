    "plain_text": "# Talos on the developing situation in Ukraine\n\n**[blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/02/current-executive-guidance-for-ongoing.html](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/02/current-executive-guidance-for-ongoing.html)**\n\n**This post is also available in:**\n\n[日本語 (Japanese)](https://gblogs.cisco.com/jp/2022/03/security-talos-on-the-developing-situation-in-ukraine/)\n\n[Українська (Ukrainian)](https://talosintelligence.com/resources/411)\n\nIn the last month, Talos has seen a shift in activity in response to the unjust invasion of\nUkraine. This post is meant to serve as our executive overview of the situation and provide\nyou with the most up-to-date information and security content from Talos. As with any highly\nfluid or dynamic situation, we are doing our best to provide our customers with highly\naccurate and timely intelligence and information.\n\nContent related to Ukrainian activity:\n\nPlease note that indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to the activity are available in\n[theHermeticWiper andWhisperKill blogs.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/02/threat-advisory-hermeticwiper.html)\n\n## General guidance\n\n\n-----\n\nOur general and primary guidance for companies and individuals alike continues to echo the\nrecommendations from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)\n[\"Shields Up\" guidance.](https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up)\n\nTalos is proud of not only our team's cybersecurity response but also a volunteer OSINT\nforce of over 500 motivated Cisco teammates. Even more are undertaking humanitarian\nrefugee relief efforts to make life just a little safer and easier in a part of the world many have\nnever been. Teams have set aside their normal tasks, and now watch over Ukrainian\nnetworks, others have focused on caring for and protecting refugees and still, others have\nturned their obsession with social media into a critical component of our open-source\nintelligence work.\n\n\n-----",
