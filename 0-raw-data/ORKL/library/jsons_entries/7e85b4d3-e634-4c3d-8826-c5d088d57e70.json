Commodity ransomware typically spreads like a virus that\ninfects devices and only requires malware remediation. Human-operated ransomware is the\nresult of an active attack by cybercriminals that infiltrate an organization’s on-premises or\ncloud IT infrastructure, elevate their privileges, and deploy ransomware to critical data.\n\nThese “hands-on-keyboard” attacks target an organization rather than a single device and\nleverage human attackers’ knowledge of common system and security misconfigurations to\ninfiltrate the organization, navigate the enterprise network, and adapt to the environment and\nits weaknesses as they go. Hallmarks of these human-operated ransomware attacks\ntypically include credential theft and lateral movement and can result in deployment of a\nransomware payload to high business impact resources the attackers choose.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese attacks can be catastrophic to business operations and are difficult to clean up,\nrequiring complete adversary eviction to protect against future attacks. Unlike commodity\nransomware that only requires malware remediation, human-operated ransomware will\ncontinue to threaten your business operations after the initial encounter.\n\nThis figure shows how this extortion-based attack that uses maintenance and security\nconfiguration gaps and privileged access is growing in impact and likelihood.\n\n## Protect your organization against ransomware and extortion\n\nFor a comprehensive view of ransomware and extortion and how to protect your\norganization, use the information in the Human-Operated Ransomware Mitigation Project\n**Plan PowerPoint presentation.**\n\nHere's a summary of the guidance:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe stakes of ransomware and extortion-based attacks are high.\nHowever, the attacks have weaknesses that can mitigate your likelihood of being\nattacked.\nThere are three phases to configure your infrastructure to exploit attack weaknesses.\n\nFor the three phases to exploit attack weaknesses, see the Protect your organization against\nransomware and extortion solution to quickly configure your IT infrastructure for the best\nprotection:\n\n1. Prepare your organization to recover from an attack without having to pay the ransom.\n2. Limit the scope of damage of an attack by protecting privileged roles.\n3. Make it harder for an attacker to get into your environment by incrementally removing\n\nrisks.\n\n[Download the Protect your organization from ransomware poster for an overview of the three](https://download.microsoft.com/download/5/e/3/5e37cbff-9a7a-45b2-8b95-6d3cc5426301/protect-your-organization-from-ransomware.pdf)\nphases as layers of protection against ransomware attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Additional ransomware resources\n\nKey information from Microsoft:\n\n[The growing threat of ransomware, Microsoft On the Issues blog post on July 20, 2021](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/07/20/the-growing-threat-of-ransomware/)\n[Rapidly protect against ransomware and extortion](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/compass/protect-against-ransomware)\n[2021 Microsoft Digital Defense Report (see pages 10-19)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/microsoft-digital-defense-report)\n[Ransomware: A pervasive and ongoing threat threat analytics report in the Microsoft](https://security.microsoft.com/threatanalytics3/05658b6c-dc62-496d-ad3c-c6a795a33c27/overview)\n365 Defender portal\n\nMicrosoft's Detection and Response Team (DART) ransomware approach and\nbest practices and [case study](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/compass/dart-ransomware-case-study)\n\nMicrosoft 365:\n\n[Deploy ransomware protection for your Microsoft 365 tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/ransomware-protection-microsoft-365)\n[Maximize Ransomware Resiliency with Azure and Microsoft 365](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/maximize-ransomware-resiliency-with-azure-and-microsoft-365/)\n[Recover from a ransomware attack](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/recover-from-ransomware)\n[Malware and ransomware protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/assurance/assurance-malware-and-ransomware-protection)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Protect your Windows 10 PC from ransomware](https://support.microsoft.com//windows/protect-your-pc-from-ransomware-08ed68a7-939f-726c-7e84-a72ba92c01c3)\n[Handling ransomware in SharePoint Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/troubleshoot/security/handling-ransomware-in-sharepoint-online)\n[Threat analytics reports for ransomware in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/threatanalytics3?page_size=30&filters=tags%3DRansomware&ordering=-lastUpdatedOn&fields=displayName,alertsCount,impactedEntities,reportType,createdOn,lastUpdatedOn,tags,flag)\n\nMicrosoft 365 Defender:\n\n[Find ransomware with advanced hunting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/advanced-hunting-find-ransomware)\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud Apps:\n\n[Create anomaly detection policies in Defender for Cloud Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/anomaly-detection-policy)\n\nMicrosoft Azure:\n\nMicrosoft Security team blog posts:\n\n[3 steps to prevent and recover from ransomware (September 2021)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/07/3-steps-to-prevent-and-recover-from-ransomware/)\n\n[A guide to combatting human-operated ransomware: Part 1 (September 2021)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/20/a-guide-to-combatting-human-operated-ransomware-part-1/)\n\nKey steps on how Microsoft's Detection and Response Team (DART) conducts\nransomware incident investigations.\n\n[A guide to combatting human-operated ransomware: Part 2 (September 2021)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/27/a-guide-to-combatting-human-operated-ransomware-part-2/)\n\nRecommendations and best practices.\n\nBecoming resilient by understanding cybersecurity risks: Part 4—navigating current\nthreats (May 2021)\n\nSee the Ransomware section.\n\n[Human-operated ransomware attacks: A preventable disaster (March 2020)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/03/05/human-operated-ransomware-attacks-a-preventable-disaster/)\n\nIncludes attack chain analyses of actual attacks.\n\n[Ransomware response—to pay or not to pay?
