Ever since their first attacks, which involved DDoS operations\nagainst various organizations across different industries, the group has managed to step up\ntheir attacks even further. Two of the group's most notable campaigns include the 2014 Sony\nhack, which involved sensitive company and personal information, and the 2016 Bangladeshi\nbankattack that stole millions of dollars from the financial institution. Recently, the group was\nseen expanding into cryptocurrency attacks, with the use of the RATANKBA malware to\ntarget cryptocurrency companies\n\n**_Timeline of Lazarus Group Activities_**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Lazarus group has had multiple operations over the years, most of which involve either\ndisruption, sabotage, financial theft or espionage. The organization also has “spin-off”\ngroups, which focus on specific kinds of attacks and targets:\n\n**_Bluenoroff:_**\n\nA subgroup focused on attacking foreign financial institutions. They are responsible for a\nwide array of financial theft incidents, including the aforementioned attack on a Bangladeshi\nbank.\n\n**_Andariel:_**\n\nA subgroup focused on South Korean organizations and businesses using specifically\ntailored methods created for maximum effectivity.\n\nThe chart below shows a timeline of the group’s activities and objectives over the years.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Timeline of Lazarus Group activities_\nA quick glance at the timeline of the group’s activities provides clues on the way they\noperate. Lazarus and its various subgroups will typically perform disruption and misdirection\noperations as part of their objectives. The group is fairly versatile as well, as they use a wide\nvariety of tools and tactics to perform their attacks. Here are some examples of the group's\nobjectives, tools, and procedures:\n\n**_Notable Tactics of Lazarus_**\n\n**_Disruption_**\n\nThe disruptive operations performed by Lazarus involve DDOS attacks and Wipers with timebased triggers. These include KILLMBR with a hard-coded wiping date, and QDDOS, which\nhas duration date that wipes data ten days after infection. DESTOVER, a backdoor equipped\nwith wiping capabilities, is another example.\n\n**_Misdirection_**\nLazarus also included misdirection on some of their campaigns. Some operations were\ndisguised as hacktivist activities, with groups such as \"GOP,\" \"WhoAmI,\" and \"New Romanic\nArmy\" claiming responsibility for these alleged hacktivism attacks. They also tried to emulate\nthe modus operandi of hacktivists by defacing web pages and leaking information.\n\nLazarus also plants false flags inside their tools as another misdirection technique. One\nexample is the KLIPOD backdoor, which uses Romanized Russian words for its backdoor\ncommands. While it is possible that Lazarus has members from different countries, the\n\n\n-----\n\nRomanized Russian words do not appear to be written by a native speaker, and arguably\nused for misdirection.\n\nWhile the objectives of these attacks vary from sabotage to financial gain, Lazarus did put\nsome effort to misdirect attribution efforts towards other entities.\n\n**_Protectors_**\n\nLazarus makes use of commercially available protectors for its tools. However, during their\nactual attacks, we have seen them deploy both protected and unprotected versions of their\ntools on the same target:\n\n**_Anti-Forensics_**\n\nLazarus also employed some anti-forensics techniques in their operations, which include:\n\n**Separation of components: In the later years of Lazarus operations, particularly**\noperations related to the Bluenoroff subgroup, they made use of component separation\nfor their malware\n**Command line tools: Lazarus, again via Bluenoroff, makes use of command line**\nbackdoors and installers. Aside from separating the components, they also require\nspecific arguments for execution. The installer of the Nestegg framework, for example,\nrequires a password as an argument along with other switches. Their backdoor\nKLIPOD, on the other hand, receives its C2 server as a command line argument.\n**Disk Wiping: Lazarus previously used wipers for disruption and sabotage. In later**\nyears, wiper samples in various forms can still be seen in their operations, although\nthere are no reports of it being used. In particular, DESTOVER samples were seen in\nsome of Bluenoroff operations, but no actual wiping occurred or was reported. In\naddition, command line forms of wiper tools were also recovered. These wipers may\nhave been designed to wipe traces of the attacker’s activities after the campaign has\nbeen completed, to leave as little evidence as possible.\n**Prefetch, event logs, and MFT record wipers: In an effort to cover their tracks,**\nLazarus later made use of tools that can delete evidence. These include prefetch\ndeletion, event logs deletion which support various OS versions, and MFT record\nwiping.\n\n**Defending against threats posed by Lazarus and other similar attacks:**\n\n[The Lazarus Group—and any kind of targeted attack—is dangerous because of the wide](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/understanding-targeted-attacks-goals-and-motives)\nvariety of tools at their disposal and the different tactics they use depending on their targets\nand their objectives. This means that an organization’s security and IT professionals must\nensure that every corner of their network infrastructure is secure from different kinds of\nattacks. This includes ensuring that all machines connected to the network are always\n\n\n-----\n\nupdated with the latest security patches to minimize vulnerability exploitation. As information\ntheft is also a prime objective of targeted attacks, protecting data from any possible breach\nshould also be top priority.\n\nOrganizations can also look into multilayered security solutions such as Trend Micro™ Deep\nDiscovery™, which provides real-time protection against targeted attacks. It can detect\ntargeted attacks anywhere in the network. It features smart XGen™ technology that utilizes a\nblend of cross-generational techniques for applying the right technology at the right time,\n[resulting in the highest detection rate possible. Trend Micro™ Office Scan™ protects the](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/network/deep-discovery.html)\norganization’s users and corporate information by providing multiple layers of XGen™\nsecurity protection. It includes a comprehensive list of features such as machine learning,\nbehavioral analysis, exploit protection, advanced ransomware protection, application\nwhitelisting, sandbox integration, and more.\n\nHIDE\n\n**Like it?
