Review the IOCs in the CSV file and check if they have been observed in their\n\nenvironment.\n2. Perform an active scan of all systems and include the file hashes in the organization's\n\nAV/EDR solutions.\n3. Make sure all VPN and email servers are upgraded to the latest version to resolve any\n\nvulnerabilities that threat actors can use to gain access to internal networks.\n4. If servers are not up to date, update them and perform password resets for all users.\n5. Increase monitoring for unusual events in the corporate networks.\n6. Report any breaches or unusual activity to the Israeli Israel National Cyber Directorate.\n\n## Hille Yaffe still struggling\n\nIn the meantime, the Hillel Yaffe Medical Center in the north of Tel Aviv is still struggling with\nthe restoration of its systems, and the staff is using \"pen a paper\" to admit patients and\ncirculate exams for the sixth day now.\n\nEven though there's hope that the Hillel Yaffe Medical Center will return to normal operations\n[in a few days, there are fears that some medical records will be unrecoverable.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/officials-said-to-fear-some-medical-records-lost-forever-in-hospital-cyberattack/)\n\nThis is because the ransomware actors reportedly accessed the backup system, wiping all\ncopies stored there for emergency cases like cyberattacks.\n\n[Reuven Eliyahu, the cybersecurity chief in the Health Ministry has confirmed that the mid-](https://www.timesofisrael.com/top-cyber-official-hospital-attack-purely-financial-likely-by-chinese-group/)\nweek attack was carried out by Chinese hackers in a statement today, and described the\nactors’ motives as “purely financial”.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is probably a Chinese hacker group that broke away from another group and started\nworking in August,\" Eliyahu said in an interview with Army Radio. \"The motive for the attack\nwas purely financial.\"\n\nHowever, a source in the cybersecurity industry has told BleepingComputer that the\nattribution to China is weak and that the attacks may have simply been port scans or probes\ninto a network's defenses.\n\nAs for the ransom payment, the Hillel Yaffa center is a government-owned hospital, and as\nsuch, it won't negotiate with hackers.\n\n_Update 10/18/21 02:31 PM EST: Added further information about attribution to China._\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Clop ransomware gang is back, hits 21 victims in a single month](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-gang-is-back-hits-21-victims-in-a-single-month/)\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience\nworking on various online publications.
