Now they believe China vacuumed up reams of\ninformation in a bid to develop better artificial intelligence, or AI.\n\nMatt Chinworth for NPR\nSteven Adair hunts hackers for a living. Back in January, in a corner-of-his-eye, peripheral\nkind of way, he thought he saw one in his customer's networks — a shadowy presence\ndownloading emails.\n\nAdair is the founder of a cybersecurity company called Volexity, and he runs traps to corner\nintruders all the time. So he took a quick look at a server his client was using to run Microsoft\nExchange and was stunned to \"see requests that we're not expecting,\" he said. There were\nrequests for access to specific email accounts, requests for confidential files.\n\nHe followed all this requested information to a virtual server off-site. \"The hair is almost rising\non my arms right now when I think about it,\" Adair told NPR later. \"This feeling of like, oh,\ncrap this is not what should be going on.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat Adair discovered was a massive hack into Microsoft Exchange — one of the most\npopular email software programs in the world. For nearly three months, intruders helped\nthemselves to everything from emails to calendars to contacts. Then they went wild and\nlaunched a second wave of attacks to sweep Exchange data from tens of thousands of\nunsuspecting victims. They hit mom-and-pop shops, dentist offices, school districts, local\ngovernments — all in a brazen attempt to vacuum up information.\n\nBoth the White House and Microsoft have said unequivocally that Chinese governmentbacked hackers are to blame.\n\nNPR's months-long examination of the attack — based on interviews with dozens of players\nfrom company officials to cyber forensics experts to U.S. intelligence officials — found that\nstealing emails and intellectual property may only have been the beginning. Officials believe\nthat the breach was in the service of something bigger: China's artificial intelligence\nambitions. The Beijing leadership aims to lead the world in a technology that allows\ncomputers to perform tasks that traditionally required human intelligence — such as finding\npatterns and recognizing speech or faces.\n\n\"There is a long-term project underway,\" said Kiersten Todt, who was the executive director\nof the Obama administration's bipartisan commission on cybersecurity and now runs the\nCyber Readiness Institute. \"We don't know what the Chinese are building, but what we do\nknow is that diversity of data, quality of data aggregation, accumulation of data is going to be\ncritical to its success.\"\n\n## The break-in\n\nThe intruders broke into Exchange by finding a handful of coding errors that gave them entry\ninto Exchange servers and then allowed them to take control. Vulnerable systems just\nneeded to satisfy two conditions: They had to be connected to the internet and controlled\nlocally by the company's IT department, something known in cyber lingo as \"on premises,\" or\n\"on prem.\" (Microsoft's Office 365 wasn't swept up in the breach because it runs in the cloud,\nwhich offers more protection.)\n\nThe hack was fairly straightforward: Once the attackers locked onto a target and slipped into\nthe exposed Exchange servers, they planted code that essentially tricked it into requesting\ninformation — emails, documents, PDFs — and then any servers on the other end assumed\nthe request was legitimate.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Enlarge this image](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/07/07/20210624-stevenadair-charbage-01_custom-b0ac0fe8c86a528e618e4246f0bf6ccdcf109745-s1200.jpg)\nSteven Adair, the founder of a Virginia-based cybersecurity company called Volexity, was the\nfirst to discover the Microsoft Exchange hack in the wild. \"The hair is almost rising on my\narms right now when I think about it,\" he says. Claire Harbage/NPR hide caption\n\n**toggle caption**\nClaire Harbage/NPR\n\nSteven Adair, the founder of a Virginia-based cybersecurity company called Volexity, was the\nfirst to discover the Microsoft Exchange hack in the wild. \"The hair is almost rising on my\narms right now when I think about it,\" he says.\n\nClaire Harbage/NPR\n\"It was like a conversation in which the receiving server was saying, 'Oh, you're the\nExchange server, you're a trusted entity, you're allowed to do this,' \" Adair said, \"and\nbasically it doesn't check that this is a completely unauthenticated request.\"\n\nAs soon as Adair saw that, he reached out to Microsoft.\n\n## \"A relatively routine report\"\n\nThese days most companies run Exchange in the cloud so Microsoft takes care of data\nsecurity. Some banks, big corporations and defense companies run a hybrid system, using\nthe cloud for a lot of their day-to-day operations but maintaining servers in-house to store\n\n\n-----\n\nproprietary information they d prefer to control.\n\nCompanies running their own Exchange servers tend to be small and medium-size firms,\nplaces with small IT departments that, until recently, didn't spend much time worrying about\nbeing targeted in a cyberattack. But that's exactly what happened — because if their email\nserver was connected to the internet it meant any bad guy could hit it.\n\n\"At the time it was perceived as a relatively routine report of a couple of vulnerabilities,\" Tom\nBurt, a vice president at Microsoft who manages the digital crimes unit, told NPR. \"It was in\njust a couple of dozen entities worldwide and just a handful in the U.S. We and the rest of the\ndefender community see this activity happening all the time.\"\n\nMicrosoft has a Threat Intelligence Center, called MSTIC, that is responsible for investigating\nand responding to attacks. It tracks dozens of nation-state hackers and has specialists who\nfollow particular groups. So it didn't take MSTIC long to determine who was roaming around\n[in Exchange servers: a group of Chinese government hackers known as Hafnium.](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/02/new-nation-state-cyberattacks/)\n\nHafnium, Burt says, is relatively new; Microsoft has only been tracking it regularly since June\n2020. It has an M.O. — it tends to target information at government agencies, medical\ncompanies and universities.\n\nTypically, hackers find targets by scanning the internet. They look for systems that haven't\nbeen updated or patched. Investigators believe that in this case the hackers scanned the\ninternet for companies that were running Exchange locally.\n\nThe second step of the hack was a bit more perplexing. The attackers seemed to have a\nweirdly specific piece of data ready to deploy: the exact email addresses of various people\nrunning Exchange servers around the world. That struck Burt as odd, because those email\naddresses \"would be different for every single company and organization around the world,\"\nhe said. \"And that's not public information. So when we looked at this we thought: How is this\nhappening?\"\n\nWhile on its face that was troubling, for most of January and February, the breach appeared\nmanageable — the hack hadn't been widely deployed, and Microsoft was already at work on\na patch to correct the coding errors that let the hackers in in the first place. The plan was to\nrelease it on its regularly scheduled patch day — known as Patch Tuesday, the first Tuesday\nof every month. But something unexpected happened: The hack went viral.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Enlarge this image](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/07/12/2021-07-07-microsofthack-jtamayo_020_custom-816efb3826609ba27f22652cfd9fbdb223eaf8e6-s1200.jpg)\nThe hackers were part of a group out of China that Microsoft calls Hafnium. Tom Burt, a vice\npresident at Microsoft who manages the digital crimes unit, says Hafnium emerged on the\nscene in June 2020.

Tom Burt, a vice\npresident at Microsoft who manages the digital crimes unit, says Hafnium emerged on the\nscene in June 2020.\n\nJovelle Tamayo for NPR\n\"All of a sudden we saw hundreds a day and then that continued to escalate until we were\nseeing north of several thousand a day,\" Burt said. \"It was a very significant and noisy\nescalation. And as we watched that happen, we actually saw a number of different known\nChinese actors and a wide range of unknown groups operating from China, all using this\nexploit.\"\n\nJohn Lambert, the head of the MSTIC team, likened it to \"the moment before a firecracker\ngoes off. You know something's going to happen and you want to know: How loud is this\ngoing to be?\"\n\nClearly, this was going to be loud — and waiting for Patch Tuesday was no longer an option.\n\n\n-----\n\n## All hands on deck\n\nThe day software fixes go out to customers is actually the end of the cycle for Microsoft's\npatch team. Members of the team have spent the whole month leading up to it trying to\nunderstand a vulnerability or tweak some functional problem in the software. Patch Tuesday\nis when the world gets to see what they've been working on and apply it to their systems.\n\n\"It's like tax day for us, but it's the runup to tax day for customers,\" Chang Kawaguchi,\ndirector and chief information security officer for Microsoft 365, told NPR. \"That's why having\na Patch Tuesday, having a consistent expectation on the customer's part, is so important to\nthem, so they can plan for it.\"\n\nIf you have to release a fix anytime before a Patch Tuesday, Kawaguchi said, you ruin\nsomebody's weekend. Instead of going to a movie, they need to be in the office testing\nwhatever Microsoft has created to make sure it doesn't somehow lock up something else\nthey have running on their network.\n\nBut the metastasis of the Exchange attack at the end of February meant Kawaguchi's team\ncouldn't wait. It had to build a fix, release it and push it out to customers right away.\n\nWhat made this difficult is that, initially, those in-house Exchange servers around the world\nweren't something Microsoft could see or had access to. If the affected servers had been in\nthe cloud, the company could have just pushed out a patch and applied it itself. But because\nthey weren't, Microsoft had to find a way to convince some 350,000 IT administrators running\nExchange locally to stop whatever they were doing and patch right away. And that was\nproving to be hard.\n\nEven putting all that aside, patches are like a ticking time bomb. They don't just protect\nsystems, they alert criminals around the world how to get into unpatched systems. \"Going\npublic you can't just tell the good guys,\" Kawaguchi said. \"When we release a patch, the bad\nguys start reverse engineering it immediately. So we always know when we release that's the\nstarting gun of a race.\"\n\n## A government response\n\n\n-----\n\nMeanwhile, anxiety about the hack was beginning to ripple through the highest levels of the\n[Biden administration. National security adviser Jake Sullivan tweeted out a message urging](https://twitter.com/JakeSullivan46/status/1367660450855477256)\nIT departments to install the patches. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency released\nan [emergency directive that warned if the malicious activity was left unchecked, it could](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/03/03/cisa-issues-emergency-directive-and-alert-microsoft-exchange)\n\"enable an attacker to gain control of an entire enterprise network.\"\n\n[The White House convened a task force — in fact, Microsoft's Burt was on it — to figure out](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/17/statements-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-deputy-national-security-advisor-for-cyber-anne-neuberger-on-microsoft-exchange-vulnerabilities-ucg/)\nways to impress upon the nation's Exchange administrators just how serious this was.\n\nEven the FBI got involved. It secured a court order so it could legally scan the internet, find\nservers the Chinese had breached and then proactively remove whatever they might have\nleft there — all without informing the victims first.\n\n\"This is an active threat,\" press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at the White House while\nall this was going on. \"Everyone running these servers — government, private sector,\nacademia — needs to act now to patch them.\"\n\nKawaguchi said later, \"I think this was probably the first time a tool we built was specifically\npointed to in a White House press release. There were aspects of this incident and this\ncampaign that were definitely novel.\"\n\n[Enlarge this image](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/08/23/gettyimages-1231535992-edit_custom-923f916e48f1fb837423cb9b2492789070f3aa61-s1200.jpg)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is an active threat, White House press secretary Jen Psaki, pictured here in March,\ntold reporters as the hack started to spread. \"Everyone running these servers ... needs to act\nnow to patch them.\" Samuel Corum/Getty Images hide caption\n\n**toggle caption**\nSamuel Corum/Getty Images\n\n\"This is an active threat,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki, pictured here in March,\ntold reporters as the hack started to spread. \"Everyone running these servers ... needs to act\nnow to patch them.\"\n\nSamuel Corum/Getty Images\nKawaguchi said in his nearly 20 years at Microsoft, he'd never seen an attack scale up so\nquickly. And the breadth of it seemed out of character; nation-state hackers tend to have very\ntargeted goals, he said — they know what they want and they gather it up quietly. In this\ncase, the Chinese were acting like cybercriminals seemingly unconcerned about who or what\nmight get caught up in their attack.\n\n\"A lot of customers probably have felt 'I'm too small a fish,' \" Kawaguchi said. \" 'Nobody, no\nnation-state, is going to go after me.' And what we're seeing is because there's so much\nconnection between organizations, you can go after a small fish to get to a big fish. And so\neverybody's having to up their game.\"\n\nChina, for its part, has denied any responsibility for the Microsoft Exchange attack.\n\n## \"The Chinese are very Shop-Vac-oriented\"\n\nThe Microsoft Exchange hack was the latest in a long list of Chinese-sponsored\ncyberattacks. The tally in just the four years between 2014 and 2018 is head-spinning. There\nwas the Office of Personnel Management attack in which hackers spent some time in OPM\nnetworks and then whisked away 21.5 million records from the federal government's\nbackground investigation database.\n\nThere was also a breach at the health care insurer Anthem Inc. in which cyberthieves swiped\n78 million names, birth dates and Social Security numbers. Two years after that, credit\nreporting agency Equifax Inc. announced that hackers stole the credit information of 147.9\nmillion Americans. And then there was the break-in at Marriott's Starwood hotels. In 2018,\nStarwood announced that someone had cracked into its reservations database and stolen\nreservation, credit card, passport and other travel information from some 500 million people.\n\nU.S. officials said Beijing-backed hackers were behind every one of those attacks.\n\n\"If you look, just look at the Equifax breach alone, which I consider one of the greatest\ncounterintelligence successes by the Chinese Communist Party, they have all the financial\ndata for every single American adult,\" said William Evanina, former director of the National\n\n\n-----\n\nCounterintelligence and Security Center. The Chinese have more data than we have on\nourselves.\"\n\nEvanina is now the founder and CEO of the Evanina Group, a risk consultancy company,\nand he said he spends much of his time fielding calls about Chinese breaches. \"We've had\nso many, we've grown numb to it,\" he said. When it comes to information, he said, \"the\nChinese are very Shop-Vac-oriented.\"\n\n[Enlarge this image](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/08/23/gettyimages-1232586374_slide-88556031343c33e20f1bc6b8d045597cdf0691af-s1200.jpg)\nIt's been an open secret for years among intelligence officials that China has been on a\ncampaign to steal massive amounts of data. The Justice Department charged Chinese\ngovernment-based hackers thisyear with intellectual property theft.

The Justice Department charged Chinese\ngovernment-based hackers thisyear with intellectual property theft.\n\nToby Scott/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\n\n-----\n\nChina s appetite for America s private data has been one of the biggest open secrets of\nmodern intelligence. Intelligence officials estimate that China has now stolen all the personal\n[identifiable information of about 80% of Americans, and it has a good start on collecting](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-bevanina-080421.pdf)\ninformation on the remaining 20%. And while the individual breaches and numbers are\nworrying, the real issue is how all this information can be woven together to build on itself.\n\n\"Let's play spycatcher for a second here,\" says Evanina, who used to do counterintelligence\nfor the CIA. \"So you have the OPM data breach, so you have an entire security clearance file\nfor someone, you have Anthem records, you have his Marriott point record, credit cards,\nEquifax, his loans, his mortgages, his credit score.\"\n\nImagine how a Chinese intelligence officer can leverage that data to get someone talking or\nto make a connection that can be used for intelligence purposes. \"They know everything\nabout you before they even bump you on a cruise or on a vacation,\" he said.\n\n## A new moonshot\n\nFor a long time, what the Chinese government intended to do with all this information was a\nbit of a mystery, but now, some analysts said the Microsoft Exchange hack offers some new\nclues. For example, remember those IT administrator emails the Chinese needed to get into\nthe Exchange servers? Microsoft's Burt thinks they got them during an earlier Chinese\nhacking operation.\n\n\"What we've heard directly is they've accumulated vast quantities of data about Americans,\"\nBurt said. \"And they must have created a massive database that included the actual email of\nwho are the Exchange server administrators.\"\n\nChina may have been leveraging information it had stolen in other attacks. But this is the first\ntime players have actually spoken publicly about how that happened. Intelligence officials\ntold NPR this attack seemed more reckless in that respect.\n\nBut that may have been only a piece of a grander plan. Back in 2017, the Chinese\nCommunist Party announced it would be making the development of world-class artificial\n[intelligence a national priority — akin to America's race to the moon. And to do that China](https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/digichina/blog/full-translation-chinas-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-development-plan-2017/)\nmade clear it would focus on two things: developing computer scientists who can write\nalgorithms, and amassing information that world-class algorithms need to learn from.\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft's Burt says a specialized piece of information was needed to make the Exchange\nhack work — the specific email address of local Exchange server administrators. Officials\nsay they believe the Chinese got those addresses during a previous cyberattack. Jovelle\n**Tamayo for NPR hide caption**\n\n**toggle caption**\nJovelle Tamayo for NPR\nIn 2017, Chinese scholars were writing more research papers on AI than any other country in\nthe world. China has more than 1,000 AI firms, second only to the U.S., and its universities\nare churning out computer scientists at breakneck speed.\n\nChina has built-in advantages in the information race. It has more than 1 billion people it can\n(and does) collect information about, and U.S. officials said it has been supplementing all\n[that with large-scale data heists. (The Justice Department indicted four Chinese military](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-chinese-nationals-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\nhackers this year over intellectual property theft and economic espionage.)\n\nThe Cyber Readiness Institute's Todt said, against that backdrop, the second phase of the\nExchange hack — when hackers hoovered up emails and information from tens of\nthousands of companies — shouldn't be a surprise.\n\nStealing information from small- and medium-size businesses out in the American heartland\ndoesn't immediately suggest espionage. Instead, officials believe the Chinese gather this\ninformation to help them construct the informational mosaic they need to build world-class AI.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt explains their tendency, Todt said, to gather and aggregate data and as much as possible\nand not discriminating where that data comes from.\"\n\nThe reason we should care about that is because of the role AI plays in our everyday lives. It\nis becoming the mechanism by which insurance rates are calculated, credit is given,\nmortgages are approved and health care data is calculated. And Todt said Americans should\ntake a moment to reflect on what it would mean to have a technology that will touch our lives\nin a myriad of ways built by someone else and, more specifically, China.\n\n\"As it builds out its AI, China can social engineer to its priorities, to its mission,\" she said.\n\"And that mission may be different from ours.\"\n\n\n-----",
