During the investigation we found a brand new\n\nbackdoor sample, which implements lots of features by using Dropbox API, using\n\nDropbox like a C&C server. After the reverse engineering, we extract the Dropbox\n\ntoken used by the sample, dig into Dropbox folder, and reveal the whole functional\n\nstructure.\n\n_[The report is co-authored with Trend Micro.](https://www.trendmicro.com/)_\n\n_Kenney Lu, Daniel Lunghi, Cedric Pernet, and Jamz Yaneza. (17 February 2020)._\n\n_Trend Micro. “Operation DRBControl - Uncovering A Cyberespionage Campaign_\n\n_Targeting Gambling Companies In Southeast Asia”_\n\n## First Stage Infection\n\nThe threat actor uses Windows Defender Core Process MsMpEng.exe which has a\n\nlegal digital signature to load the malicious DLL file. Load the shellcode from the\n\n\nTalent-Jump Technologies, IncTalent-Jump Technologies, Inc\n\n\n-----\n\ninfection.\n\nDuring the investigation, we found a total of 8 different loader’s filenames [Appendix 1]\n\nrenamed from MsMpEng.exe and placed at C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft in its\n\nseparated folder. The loader is just called the function ServiceCrtMain imported\n\nfrom mpsvc.dll .\n\n\nThe malicious DLL file mpsvc.dll has two types [Appendix 2]. The older type will try\n\nto read shellcode from payload file English.rtf, decode and decompress the\n\ncontent using RtlDecompressBuffer to release the final executable (Figure 1).\n\n_Figure 1. Older type of mpsvc.dll_\n\nThe newer one has a different way to start the infection. There is a piece of\n\nshellcode hard-coded in the mpsvc.dll, after decoding the shellcode from\n\nmpsvc.dll, it will inject and execute to load the shellcode from mpsvc.mui\n\n(Figure 2), which will release the final executable and inject into the process.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Newer type of mpsvc.dll_\n\nBoth of these two types of mpsvc.dll will release a full functional backdoor, which\n\ncan connect to the C&C server. But the final executable released by a newer type of\n\nmpsvc.dll has some upgrade, including the function to interact with Dropbox API.\n\nThe following article will focus on the malicious executable released by the newer\n\ntype of mpsvc.dll .\n\nThe hardcoded shellcode in a newer type of mpsvc.dll will first allocate 0x80000\n\nbytes of memory space. Getting the current module’s full path and replace the\n\nextension dll to mui and read the shellcode in this mui file, then jump to the\n\nbase address of mui file plus its first byte. (Figure 3)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Decoded shellcode in mpsvc.dll_\n\nIn the end, the shellcode in mpsvc.mui has another different piece of hard-coded\n\nbytes, which will decompress by RtlDecompressBuffer to the final malicious\n\nexecutable (Figure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. The final malicious executable in buffer._\n\n## Sample Analysis\n\nThe final malicious executable sample we extracted has numerous features. Here is\n\nthe analysis of some major functions.\n\n### Bypass UAC\n\nThis sample can bypass UAC via .NET. It is not a new technique which was disclosed\n\nin 2017 [1], the threat actor only changes the GUID to 9BA94120-7E02-46ee\nADC6-10640B04F93B (Figure 5) and specify the location of DLL file which will load\n\nby the .NET application in the elevated process.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Code snippet of bypass UAC._\n\n### Persistence\n\nThere are two ways to persist. Register as a startup program in\n\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersio\n\n\nn\\\\Run if it has no privileged (Figure 6). Otherwise, it will register itself as a system\n\nservice (Figure 7).\n\n_Figure 6. Register as a start program._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Register as a system service._\n\n### Information Gathering\n\nIt will collect some basic information like IP address, hostname, username, OS\n\nversion and so on. Also, it will search the registry key’s value\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Bitcoin\\\\Bitcoin-Qt and try to look for\n\nthe wallet address if exist (Figure 8). All of this information will upload to Dropbox as\n\n%Y-%m-%d %H-%M-%S.log, below is a file sample:\n\n\nLan IP: x.x.x.x\n\nComputer: WIN-XXXXXX\n\nUserName: Administrator\n\nOS: Win10(X64)\n\nVersion: 8.0\n\nBit: Not Found !!!\n\nExist: NO\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Code snippet of information gathering._\n\n### Recording Features\n\nThis sample acquired three types of recording features, including key-log, clipboard\n\nlog, and screen recording. The screen recording file naming format is [%y-%m-%d]\n\n%H-%M-%S.avi . The key-log and clipboard log will encode by different key and salt,\n\nthen save as <hash>.pas for key-log and <hash>.log for clipboard log (Figure 9).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Code snippet of key log encoding._\n\n### Connect to C&C Server\n\nThis sample can also connect to a specific C&C server and send back data by using a\n\nfake HTTP POST request (Figure 10).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. Code snippet of preparing for fake POST request._\n\n### RTTI Information\n\nThe RTTI information remaining, here is the full class name list we got:\n\nCHPAvi\n\nCHPCmd\n\nCHPExplorer\n\nCHPHttp\n\nCHPKeyLog\n\nCHPNet\n\nCHPPipe\n\nCHPPlugin\n\nCHPProcess\n\nCHPProxy\n\nCHPRegedit\n\nCHPScreen\n\nCHPService\n\nCHPTcp\n\nCHPTelnet\n\nCHPUdp\n\n### Interact With Dropbox\n\n\n-----\n\ncharacters is hardcoded in stack string (Figure 11).\n\n_Figure 11. Code snippet for the first 24 characters of Dropbox API token._\n\nBesides connecting to the C&C server, this sample can also upload & download with\n\nDropbox API. Especially when the log file is uploaded, it will try to download\n\nbin.asc and check the file has fake GIF file header or not. If everything is correct,\n\nit will continue to the custom decoding phase, which will calculate with an array of\n\nbytes hard-coded in the sample, to release the inject payload (Figure 12).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12. Code snippet of interaction with Dropbox API._\n\n## Inside of Dropbox Folder\n\nAfter we got the Dropbox token, we can now dig into Dropbox by using official API,\n\nfor example, list the account information which creates this token, list the full file\n\nand folder information.\n\nIn the Dropbox, the folder structure like this:\n\n\n/<unique_hash>/%Y-%m-%d\\ %H:%M:%S.log\n\n/<unique_hash>/bin.asc\n\n/codex64bin.asc\n\n/codex86bin.asc\n\n/x64bin.asc\n\n/x86bin.asc\n\n\nEach infected victim has its folder named by unique hash /[0-9A-z]/, this hash is\n\ngenerated by machine key and some other information. %Y-%m-%d\\\n\n%H:%M:%S.log is the log file upload by the victim. *.asc is the file upload by the\n\nthreat actor. For example, bin.asc is the payload download by the victim when\n\nthe log file is upload succeeds.\n\n\n-----\n\n13).\n\n_Figure 13. The list of infected computers._\n\n## Second Stage Infection\n\nAfter the first infection stage completed, it will persistent itself as a system service or\n\nautorun program. Collecting information and establish a connection to the C&C\n\nserver. The most interesting part is each time when the log file is upload succeeds, it\n\nwill try to download bin.asc from each computer’s unique folder. Most of\n\n\n-----\n\nDropbox.\n\nFurther analysis of x64bin.asc, we found the second Dropbox API token, its\n\npurpose is different from the first one. Now the threat actor is ready to use Dropbox\n\nas another C&C server with the full backdoor feature.\n\nThe second infection stage’s sample has some bonus features including the ability\n\nto interact with Dropbox, the command code mapping show as below:\n\n**Command Code Action**\n\n2 ListDrives\n\n3 ListFiles\n\n4 ExecuteFile\n\n5 ManageFile\n\n6 UploadFile\n\n7 DownloadFile\n\n8 OpenTerminal\n\nIn these commands, there are three different files, each of these file has specific\n\nfilename and purpose:\n\neLHgZNBH : The status file, upload to Dropbox at regular intervals.\n\nyasHPHFJ : The command file, containing command and arguments.\n\ncsaujdnc : The execution result of the command.\n\nThe status file eLHgZNBH contain the basic information about victim and\n\ntimestamp, upload to Dropbox at regular intervals. Whenever status file upload\n\nsucceeds, it will try to download the command file yasHPHFJ if it existed. Extract\n\nthe command code and arguments from yasHPHFJ then execute the command\n\nand upload the execution result to Dropbox as csaujdnc (Figure 14).\n\n|Command Code|Action|\n|---|---|\n|2|ListDrives|\n|3|ListFiles|\n|4|ExecuteFile|\n|5|ManageFile|\n|6|UploadFile|\n|7|DownloadFile|\n|8|OpenTerminal|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14. Flow of three files interact with Dropbox_\n\nBy using this control flow, the threat actor can use Dropbox as a C&C server to\n\ncontrol the victim’s computer even the fixed connection between the specific C&C\n\nserver’s IP address has been found and blocked. Unless we block\n\ncontent.dropboxapi.com and api.dropboxapi.com, otherwise we can not\n\nisolate the infected computer.\n\nThe Dropbox API remain the detail of each file and folder, for example this is a file\n\ninformation return by Dropbox API:\n\n\n{\n\n'.tag': 'file',\n\n'name': 'Secret_File.txt',\n\n'path_lower': '/secret_file.txt',\n\n'path_display': '/Secret_File.txt',\n\n'id': 'id:<UNIQUE_FILE_ID>',\n\n'client_modified': '2019-07-21T02:45:42Z',\n\n'server_modified': '2019-07-21T02:53:04Z',\n\n'rev': '[0-9a-f]{6,}',\n\n'size': 125,\n\n'is_downloadable': True,\n\n'content_hash': '<SHA256_HASH>'\n\n}\n\n\n-----\n\nuse rev to list the full history of this file and download it. Sort out this information\n\nand the command code mapping, we can now list the full command executed on\n\neach computer and its arguments. Here is two computers’ execution list (Figure 15\n\n& 16).\n\n_Figure 15. Real command execution list from one victim._\n\n_Figure 16. Another real command execution list._\n\nAccording to these record, the threat actor follows almost the same action on every\n\ninfected computer. First, download additional attack programs from Dropbox, like\n\n\n-----\n\nof these files to Dropbox for further searching. Last but not least, infiltrate the\n\ncompany intranet or even the cloud service.\n\nCombining all decoded yasHPHFJ files, we can show the threat actor’s approximate\n\nworking hours (Figure 17).\n\n_Figure 17. The threat actor’s approximate working hours._\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe start to monitor the Dropbox for each token and parse the infected computer’s\n\nlist, here we can see the infected computer’s number from July 2019 to September\n\n2019 this two month (Figure 18 & 19).\n\n_Figure 18. Dropbox A (first token): infected computer’s number._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 19. Dropbox B (second token): infected computer’s number._\n\nWe got nearly 200 infected computers at the highest peak from Dropbox A, alone\n\nwith nearly 80 computers from Dropbox B. Both of these static has a drop at August\n\n21, 2019, the threat actor clear the Dropbox folder for some reason. Monitoring\n\nends on September 20, 2019, all tokens we got are revoked by the threat actor.\n\nDuring these two months, we got five different Dropbox token. Each of these tokens\n\nhas its purpose. The first two tokens are the major one we discuss in this article,\n\nothers are more like for testing.\n\nFrom the first infection stage, established the connection between the C&C server\n\nand Dropbox at the same time. If the IP address of the C&C server been blocked, it\n\ncan still have limited control from Dropbox. Once it completed the second infection\n\nstage, Dropbox is turning into a second channel C&C server which has full remote\n\ncontrol features (Figure 20). Steal the data and infiltrate the whole company. This\n\nmethod is not complex but very useful.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 20.
