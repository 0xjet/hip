SUMMARY\n\n#### After an extensive investigation, which revealed a widespread campaign targeting multiple universities, Accenture’s iDefense unit is publishing this report to provide threat indicators and mitigation approaches to help organizations defend themselves and ensure cyber resilience against this threat group. It’s imperative to highlight the third-party risk and supply chain threat from advanced cyber adversaries. Organizations need to understand that espionage actors will seek to exploit any organization within a target’s supply chain to fulfill its strategic collection requirements.\n\nThe authors of the technical paper titled \"Deliver Uncompromised: A Strategy for Supply Chain Security and Resilience\nin Response to the Changing Character of War\"[1] draw attention to the issue of adversarial targeting of the DoD supply\nchain by stating that most nation states have a full complement of technologies and resources available to achieve their\nasymmetric strategies and goals as they relate to cyberespionage. They take advantage of the inherent vulnerabilities[2]\nin the complex DoD supply chain ecosystem, namely a lack of oversight associated with operational security and siloed\nthreat intelligence sharing.\n\nAs referenced in the “Accenture Cyber Threatscape Report 2018,”[3] supply chains are integral to the DoD as the\nDepartment works to bring its technologies and weapon platforms to maturity. Threat actors have identified these supply\nchains as effective means of infiltrating victim organizations. Even verticals like aerospace and defense, in which\ncompanies have bought into the maintenance of mature security hygiene or in which the regulatory landscape has\nforced such adoption, supply chains still present openings.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n  - Based upon tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) correlations, campaign targeting, leveraged malware,\ninfrastructure and compelling third-party intelligence,[4] iDefense analysts have moderate to high confidence that\nthis activity is attributed to the MUDCARP (aka “TEMP.PERISCOPE” and “Leviathan”) threat group.\n\n  - As referenced in a recent Wall Street journal article[5] MUDCARP collection requirements appear to include\nseveral very specific submarine technologies produced by multiple cleared defense contractors (and their\nrespective supply chains). Any technology or program that involves the delivery or launching of a payload from\na submerged submarine, or undersea autonomous vehicles, is of high interest to MUDCARP.\n\n  - It is likely that MUDCARP actors have targeted several cleared defense contractors, universities (both domestic\nand foreign), and oceanographic institutes.\n\n  - MUDCARP and other cyberespionage threat groups will continue to target companies, think tanks and\nuniversities who are in the DoD supply chain as a means of stealing intellectual property and exploiting those\nbusiness relationships targeting DoD organizations.\n\n1 Gronager, John, et. al. \"Deliver Uncompromised: A Strategy for Supply Chain Security and Resilience in Response to the Changing Character of\n[War.” August 2018.

MITIGATIONS & RECOMENDATIONS\n\nOrganizations can proactively defend against cyberespionage campaigns targeting supply chain assets by enforcing\npolicies and procedures designed to adhere to DoD supply chain requirements and best practices. According to\nDefense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clause 252.204-7012[6], “Safeguarding Covered Defense\nInformation and Cyber Incident Reporting”, entities which comprise the DoD supply chain, except for contracts solely for\nthe acquisition of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items, have had to become National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171[7] compliant no later than December 31, 2017. This publication,\ntitled “Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations”, provides recommended\nsecurity requirements for protecting the confidentiality of controlled unclassified information when such information is\nresident in nonfederal systems and organizations.\n\nThe security requirements contained in SP 800-171 are broken down into fourteen categories or “families” which include\naccess control, configuration management, incident response, and risk assessment among many others. The\npublication then identifies specific controls, policies, and procedures for each category that relate to the general topic of\nthe family. For example, under Access Control, it is requirement that the supply chain organization authorize remote\nexecution of privileged commands and remote access to security-relevant information. Another example, under the\nIncident Response family, states that tracking, documenting and reporting incidents to designated officials both internal\nand external to the targeted organization. iDefense recommends that the requirements outlined in this publication\nshould be immediately implemented and enforced by any company or institution producing goods or services or\nconducting research on behalf of the DoD. These best practices also advertise that contractors and academic\ninstitutions educate their employees as to the breadth, depth and scope of the adversary, and the risks imposed to\nnational security; doing so will help to try to ensure an environment of supplier security and resilience by incentivizing\nproper security controls and threat intelligence sharing.\n\nRegarding the detection and remediation of MUDCARP campaigns, organizations should focus on educating staff on\nhow to detect socially engineered e-mails and the repercussions of enabling macros in Office documents sent via email. In addition, security professionals should specifically enable alerts to detect tools and techniques frequently\nutilized by MUDCARP actors. These include the delivery of malicious Microsoft Office documents exploiting the CVE2017-11882 vulnerability; the use of a custom backdoor written in JavaScript known as “Orz” that retrieves attacker\ncommands from compromised websites and MUDCARP-created profiles on legitimate networking sites; and “China\nChopper,” a simple Web shell designed to run on a variety of Web servers that allows an adversary to download files,\naccess the victim system’s Active Directory, and determine passwords via a brute-force attack.\n\n### Technical Mitigations\n\niDefense suggests organizations consider rapidly prioritizing Microsoft Office Suite application patching and updating\ndue its high popularity and constant targeting by threat groups. For example, CVE-2017-8759's patch was available on\nSeptember 12, 2018, and MUDCARP was able to deliver weaponized CVE-2017-8759 RTF documents to targets 3\ndays later. This 72-hour time frame is typically faster than most organizations 30-day Window for patching - leaving\nthem vulnerable to attacks by agile threat groups such as MUDCARP.\n\niDefense suggests organizations perform management of privileged accounts like the default Administrator account,\nwhich should be disabled and removed from systems. Threat actors like MUDCARP often target users with enhanced\nprivileges and those users should adhere to least privilege principals by limiting their use of privileged accounts to\nmitigate threat actors from exploiting their elevated permissions and authorization by enforcing role-based training and\nsecurity policies. As an example, some of the malicious MUDCARP samples identified above will not properly execute\nunless the targeted victim is the Administrator user account when opening the lure documents.\n\niDefense suggests organizations configure its e-mail gateways to inspect DKIM Signatures, SPF & DMARC records to\ndetect the absence or failure of such identifiers with incoming mail - as these authentication and identification items\n\n6 DFARS 252.204-70**. Under Secretary for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/html/current/252204.htm\n7 NIST Special Publication 800-171. National Institute of Standards and Technology. https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-171/rev-1/final\n\n\n-----\n\nhave not been typically observed on MUDCARP infrastructure and phishes. If these tests fail, consider appending\nindicators and warnings (I&Ws) in the e-mail subject line, such as [SUSPICIOUS] or [IDENTITY-UNVERIFIED] in\naddition to the normal [EXTERNAL] tag for incoming e-mail. Implementation of these I&Ws would additionally need to\nbe followed up with enhanced phishing training for your users to understand what these warning mean, and how it does\nnot positively confirm a malicious e-mail or phish but should alert them to treat the e-mail with caution.\n\niDefense suggests organizations implement network segmentation, segregation and isolation for research/high-value\nsystems in enclave networks. Threat groups like MUDCARP specifically target intellectual property and research for\nespionage or theft in these systems. Controlling information boundaries and security perimeters of these highvalue/research systems is critical to making them defensible as part of best practices for secure network architecture. It\nis advisable to request researchers define the operational network requirements (if any) needed for their research &\ndevelopment systems. Once defined, then strictly enforce network access to only permitted and approved destinations\nto mitigate exposure to threat actor infrastructure, such as MUDCARP standing up brand new domains and IPs as C2s\nthat are not necessary for researchers to connect to perform their work.\n\niDefense suggests organizations implement Web-proxy interception, categorization, and filtering of Internet-accessible\nwebsites. Threat actors like MUDCARP often establish new domains or sites without a visible or functional website that\nany visitor would find convincing or useful. Web proxies can evaluate these new domains and sites to determine\nfunctionality, popularity, newness, and reputation, which are criteria that can be used to block these sites – preventing\nadditional malicious actions or content from being delivered to the targeted user. iDefense suggests reviewing your\nWeb-proxy configuration settings to determine the effects of blocking “uncategorized,” “unpopular,” and “suspicious-”\nlike categories available from your proxy.\n\niDefense suggests that organizations identify all the user-agents installed within their environment and enforce softwarebaselines to make it easier for security to identify anomalous or rogue user-agents performing connections to external\nsites through network interception and monitoring. Threat actors like MUDCARP will sometimes utilize unique UserAgent strings to establish connections, for example: ` Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64;\nTrident/5.0; BOIE9;ENUSMSE` - which can be more easily identified during security monitoring if there is a list of known\nstandardized User-Agents to compare against.\n\niDefense suggests organizations consider migrating to Windows 10 or newer OS. Threat Actors like MUDCARP can\nutilize techniques like Reflective DLL Loading to write a DLL into memory and load a shell, like Meterpreter – which\ngives them backdoor access to the victim. However, Windows 10 OS now has Windows Defender Advanced Threat\nProtection (ATP), Exploit Guard, and Import Address Table Access Filtering (IAF) which can detect these techniques\nand upcoming security features that could even potentially mitigate it by requiring files to exist on disk before they can\nbe executed in combination with application-whitelisting.\n\niDefense suggests that organizations implement PowerShell security features. Threat actors such as MUDCARP are\nknown to utilize PowerShell to issue malicious commands and operate on compromised systems. To mitigate this tactic,\nenable PowerShell script block logging through the Windows Components -> Windows PowerShell -> \"Turn on\nPowerShell Script Block Logging\" policy value option. Furthermore, disable the PowerShell 2.0 version with the\ncommand “Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName MicrosoftWindowsPowerShellV2Root.” In addition,\nif your staff do not need or use PowerShell for business operations, consider setting the execution policy to be very\nrestrictive all users and monitor for any suspicious use of PowerShell on systems.\n\niDefense suggests organizations review and test OLE/COM blocking controls in their environment to determine if they\ncan still complete necessary business operations without Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)-embedded functionality.\nThreat actors like MUDCARP are likely to continue to utilize OLE as a method to insert malicious content inside various\nphishing documents. OLE/COM component activation can be blocked through the following registry key change:\n“\\Microsoft\\Office\\ClickToRun\\REGISTRY\\MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Common\\COM\nCompatibility\\{CLSID} DWORD ActivationFilterOverride = 1”.\n\n\n-----\n\niDefense suggests as a precaution that your organization configure Microsoft Office applications with secure technical\nimplementations that may mitigate current and future MUDCARP attack techniques that target this suite of software,\nsuch as the following:\n\n  - Threat actors may attempt to force Office applications to spawn an instance of Internet Explorer that loads\ndangerous content, such as ActiveX. To mitigate this, enable “Restrict ActiveX Installs” in Internet Explorer,\nenable \"Scripted Window Security Restrictions\" and enable Binding of these security policies to Microsoft office\napplications through the Security Settings -> IE Security “Bind to Object” so they cannot be bypassed.\n\n  - Threat actors may embed navigation to URLs or other hyperlinks within lure document to compromise the user.\nTo mitigate this technique, enable the block of URL navigation from Office files through the Security Settings ->\nIE Security \"Navigate URL\" option. Furthermore, consider training users to manually navigate in URLs needed\nfor business and to be wary of such links provided by external sources.\n\n  - Threat actors may utilize exploits in certain Office documents and templates. Enable Protected View to mitigate\nexploits for files originating from the internet, files located in potentially unsafe locations and Outlook\nattachments, through the Security -> Trust Center -> Protected View options. Furthermore, enable Data\nExecution Prevention (DEP) through the System -> Advanced system settings -> Settings -> Data Execution\nPrevention -> \"Turn on DEP for all programs and services except those I select\" option. In addition, enable\nControl Flow Guard (CFG) through the Windows Defender Security Center -> App & browser control -> Exploit\nprotection settings -> System settings -> \"Control flow guard (CFG)\" option.\n\n  - Threat actors may embed macros or VBA scripts in Office files to execute malicious actions. Block macros from\nrunning in Office files from the Internet through the Security -> Trust Center options. Furthermore, disable\ntrusted access to the VBA object model through the Security -> Trust Center \"Trust access to Visual Basic\nProject\", disable “VBScript to run in Internet Explorer” and train users to be wary of all macros from external\nsources.\n\n  - Threat actors may establish second-stage payload and malware downloads through the initial e-mail\nattachment and deceive users or bypass download warning prompts. To mitigate this, disable any file\ndownloads requested by Office applications through the Security Settings -> IE Security \"Restrict File\nDownload\" option.\n\n  - Threats actors may link external content inside Office files which can cause changes in the document without\nthe user’s knowledge. To mitigate this, disable automatic updating of links through the Word Options ->\nAdvanced \"Update automatic links at Open\".\n\n  - Threat actors may use password-protection or other rights-management features in Office files to encrypt\nmalicious macros or scripts within the file to bypass Anti-Virus scanning. To mitigate this, enable scanning of\nencrypted macros through the Security -> Trust Center \"Scan encrypted macros in Word Open XML\ndocuments\" option.\n\n  - Threat actors may attempt to load local Web pages through Office files to bypass security controls. To mitigate\nthis, disable local machine zone elevation through the Security Settings -> IE Security \"Protection From Zone\nElevation\" option. Furthermore, block invoked hyperlink instances of popups from Office documents through the\nSecurity Settings -> IE Security \"Block popups\" option.\n\n  - Threat actors may attempt to load malicious files through external web content. To mitigate this, enable the\nSmart Screen Filter through the Windows Components -> Internet Explorer -> Internet Control Panel -> Security\nPage -> Restricted Sites Zone -> ”Turn on SmartScreen Filter scan” option.\n\n  - Threat actors may also target wordpad.exe rather than winword.exe with RTF files - so exploit protection\nmitigations should be enabled to mitigate against this. Enable Control Flow Guard (CFG) through the Windows\nDefender Security Center -> App & browser control -> Exploit protection settings -> System settings -> \"Control\nflow guard (CFG)\" option for wordpad.exe.\n\niDefense suggests maintaining and configuring any detonation chambers, or anti-malware sandboxes to match the\ncurrent running configuration and software versions of production systems in your environment. This can be important\nfor running and testing incoming files to your organizations for the presence of malicious code that may only specifically\ntarget certain product versions with new vulnerabilities that may not correctly exploit sandboxes that diverge from\nproduction.\n\n\n-----\n\niDefense suggests that organizations actively hunt for attachments sent to your organization with the presence of OLEembedded objects, Equation Editor and linked objects. An example of one of these hunting rules is provided below for\nreference:\n\n_rule CVE_2017_11882{_\n_meta:_\n_description = \"Exploit for CVE-2017-11882\"_\n_author = \"iDefense Vulnerability Research Labs\"_\n_strings:_\n_$rtf_header = \"\\\\rtf\" nocase_\n_$rtf_objclass = \"\\\\objclass\" nocase_\n_$rtf_objupdate = \"\\\\objupdate\" nocase_\n_$rtf_objdata = \"\\\\objdata\" nocase_\n\n_$equation_text = \"Equation.3\"_\n_$equation_hex = \"4571756174696f6e2e33\"_\n_$ole_header_hex = \"d0cf11e0a1b11ae1\"_\n\n_$text_1 = \"636d64\"    nocase_\n_$text_2 = \"7374617274\" nocase_\n_$text_3 = \"6d73687461\" nocase_\n_$text_4 = \"68747470\"  nocase_\n\n_condition:_\n_3 of ($rtf_*) and_\n_2 of ($text_*) and_\n_1 of ($equation*) and_\n_$ole_header_hex_\n_}_\n\n## 3.

After establishing a connection to the C2, the BADFLICK malware will accept\ncommands to return a reverse shell or perform remote operations such as searching for files on the infected host and\ndownloading/uploading files to or from the C2. iDefense judges that based on the lack of persistence methods of\nBADFLICK, it is likely used to download a third-stage backdoors or implants that will maintain persistence on the victim\nsystem for advanced operations and targeting.\n\n--\niDefense suggests organizations perform historical searches, monitoring and blocking of the following indicators:\n\n### Historical and Related MUDCARP Indicators\n\n_File Hashes:_\n\n3cd25b30c7f25435c17eaf4829fe1fb6\neb136010f134009817b41bc9e51b6c5d03e51f3a\nbfc5c6817ff2cc4f3cd40f649e10cc9ae1e52139f35fdddbd32cb4d221368922\n\n2dd9aab33fcdd039d3a860f2c399d1b1\nb6643ff79369bbc3aa3c62599671b5b166505432\n305f331bfb1e97028f8c92cbcb1dff2741dcddacc76843e65f9b1ec5a66f52bc\n\nabb77435a85dd381036d3bfcb04aa80d\n015b556af90959c78c988dca532592bfa733475b\n\n\n-----\n\n80b931ab1798d7d8a8d63411861cee07e31bb9a68f595f579e11d3817cfc4aca\n\n3eb6f85ac046a96204096ab65bbd3e7e\nb85368d79231edf57b8f840c876b539657f2d3ae\n146aa9a0ec013aa5bdba9ea9d29f59d48d43bc17c6a20b74bb8c521dbb5bc6f4\n\nab662cee6419327de86897029a619aeb\nbf8a297b4a1fd8ee1666be74afca80a8addb145d\n6f6ee01e9dc2d8c4c260ef4131fe88dc152e53ee8afd3e66e92d4e1bf5fd2e92\n\n35f456afbe67951b3312f3b35d84ff0a\n05e5632ca8c205457d537a6206314e17aad9c9e5\nced7ca9625543d3d3d09f70223cc19f0d99e21792854452df5ba84b3a59d17b8\n\nbd9e4c82bf12c4e7a58221fc52fed705\naa6a121f98330df2edee6c4391df21ff43a33604\n7ba05abdf8f0323aa30c3d52e22df951eb5b67a2620014336eab7907b0a5cedf\n\nf8858db5b412deb29800458201912b37\n942ef4e9d0ac0cbb356df9cf17fca19220fbed7b\nc92a26c42c5fe40bd343ee94f5022e05647876daa9b9d76a4eeb8a89b7f7103d\n\naca7037286b64b0da05c9708d647c013\nd84eb5b6c506d22eaf6bcb2b4f743101d010e721\nc0b8d15cd0f3f3c5a40ba2e9780f0dd1db526233b40a449826b6a7c92d31f8d9\n\ne1512a0bf924c5a2b258ec24e593645a\n5e39ea9a92662270f616860546277eaa3703ca8a\nc7fa6f27ec4f4142ae591f2dd7c63d046431945f03c87dbed88d79f55180a46d\n\ne3867f6e964a29134c9ea2b63713f786\nd058567274b5d10f78eebefde62e35f6a389272f\ncdf6e2e928a89cbb857e688055a25e37a8d8b8b90530bd52c8548fb544f66f1f\n\n6e843ef4856336fe3ef4ed27a4c792b1\n1875db18a7c01ec011b1fe2394dfc49ed8a53956\n5860ddc428ffa900258207e9c385f843a3472f2fbf252d2f6357d458646cf362\n\n_Domains:_\n\n   - eujinonline.sytes[.]net   - update.wsmcoff[.]com\n\n   - api.wsmcoff[.]com   - info.wsmcoff[.]com\n\n   - kc.wsmcoff[.]com   - store.wsmcoff[.]com\n\n   - wsmcoff[.]com   - thyssenkrupp-marinesystems[.]org\n\n   - chemscalere[.]com   - www.chemscalere[.]com\n\n   - webmail.chemscalere[.]com   - mail.chemscalere[.]com\n\n   - update.chemscalere[.]com   - cpanel.chemscalere[.]com\n\n   - autoconfig.chemscalere[.]com   - about.chemscalere[.]com\n\n   - news.chemscalere[.]com   - ftp.chemscalere[.]com\n\n   - db.chemscalere[.]com   - catalog.chemscalere[.]com\n\n   - autodiscover.chemscalere[.]com   - scsnewstoday.com\n\n   - mail.scsnewstoday.com\n\n\n-----\n\n_URLs:_\n\n  - hxxp://www.thyssenkrupp-marinesystems[.]org/templater.doc\n\n  - hxxp://www.thyssenkrupp-marinesystems[.]org/templater.hta\n\n  - wsdl=ftp://185.106.120[.]206/pub/readme.txt\n\n  - wsdl=fxp://185.106.120[.]206/pub/readme.txt\n\n_IPs:_\n\n   - 103.243.175[.]181   - 185.106.120[.]206   - 89.245.139[.]187\n\n## 4. CONCLUSION\n\nAt this time, iDefense is still analyzing the data sets collected by proprietary sensors and intelligence operations in order\nto bolster the findings included in this report. However, there have been no identified reasons to believe that this data\nset is incorrect.\n\nAs indicated by the 2018 Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) Worldwide Threat Assessment report,\nChina will continue to target cleared defense contractors, IT and communications firms using its robust cyber espionage\ncapabilities.[8] Moreover, based upon China’s integrated and long-term military modernization plans, it could be assumed\nthat Chinese-sponsored collection against maritime technologies that afford advantages to Western and allied naval\nforces will continue into the foreseeable future.\n\niDefense believes that DoD supply chain assets, with an emphasis on medium and small contractors, academic\ninstitutions and think tanks will continue to be prime targets for adversaries such as MUDCARP. Until requirements,\nsuch as those specified in NIST SP 800-171 and \"Deliver Uncompromised: A Strategy for Supply Chain Security and\nResilience in Response to the Changing Character of War\", are implemented by members of the DoD supply chain and\nroutinely audited and enforced by the United States government, foreign threat actors will continue to actively exploit\nthese shortcomings.\n\n8 “Worldwide Threat Assessment of the Intelligence Community.” February 13, 2018.\n[https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Testimonies/2018-ATA---Unclassified-SSCI.pdf](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Testimonies/2018-ATA---Unclassified-SSCI.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nin the United States and in foreign countries.
