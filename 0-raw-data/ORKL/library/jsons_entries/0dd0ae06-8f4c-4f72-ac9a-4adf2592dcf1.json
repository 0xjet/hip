The operation, partially described in a recent article by Tencent,\nprimarily targeted Chinese territory until recently, when it broke out around the world.\n\nDespite the sophistication, this attack looks like a work in progress, with many components\nin the early stage of development. Although the campaign has not reached the magnitude\nof the [Zacinlo adware campaign, it is already infecting users worldwide.](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2018/06/six-years-and-counting-inside-the-complex-zacinlo-ad-fraud-operation/)\n\nWe discovered that the operators of this rootkit-enabled spyware are continuously testing\nnew components on already-infected users and regularly making minor improvement to old\ncomponents. The various components can serve different purposes or take different\napproaches to achieving their goals. Some of the most important components shipped with\nthe malware can achieve the following:\n\nExtract cookies and steal login credentials from Google Chrome, Chromium, Mozilla\n**Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Baidu Browser and Yandex**\n**Browser.**\nSteal a user’s payment accounts from his Facebook, Amazon and Airbnb\nwebpages.\nSend friend requests to other accounts, from the user’s Facebook account.\n\n\n-----\n\nSend phishing messages to the victim s Facebook friends containing malicious APKs\nused to infect Android users as well.\nSteal login credentials for the user’s account on Steam.\nInject JavaScript adware in Internet Explorer.\nInstall Chrome/Opera extensions to inject JavaScript adware on these browsers as\nwell.\nExfiltrate browsing history.\nSilently display ads or muted YouTubevideos to users via Chrome. We found some\ndroppers that can install Chrome if it is not already on the victim’s computer.\nSubscribe users to YouTube video channels.\nDownload and execute any payload.\n\nWant to learn more?
