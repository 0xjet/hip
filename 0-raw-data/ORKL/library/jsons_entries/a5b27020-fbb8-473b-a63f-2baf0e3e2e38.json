The cracking process may take a large_\n_amount of time, up to tens of hours,”_ _[reads the announcement published by Avast. “The](https://decoded.avast.io/threatresearch/decrypted-targetcompany-ransomware/)_\n_decryptor periodically saves the progress and if you interrupt it and restart the decryptor later,_\n_it offers you an option to resume the previously started cracking process.”_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe password cracking process is only needed once per PC, there is no need to repeat it for\neach file.\n\n[TargetCompany ransomware decryptor utility can download from Avast server, a simple](https://files.avast.com/files/decryptor/avast_decryptor_atomsilo.exe)\ninterface instructs the users in the decryption process.\n\n_“On the final wizard page, you can opt-in whether you want to backup encrypted files. These_\n_backups may help if anything goes wrong during the decryption process. This option is_\n_turned on by default, which we recommend.” continues Avast._\n\n[TargetCompany has been active since June 2021, once encrypted a file it adds](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/763499/targetcompany-ransomware-support-topic/)\n.mallox, .exploit, .architek, or .brg extension to the filenames of encrypted files.\n\nLike other ransomware, TargetCompany removes shadow copies on all drives and kills some\nprocesses that may hold open valuable files, such as databases.\n\nOnce the encryption process is completed it drops a ransom note file named “HOW TO\nRECOVER !!.TXT” in all folders containing encrypted files.\n\nOver the past months Avast has released other free decryptors for other ransomware,\n[including Babuk,](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/123844/malware/babuk-ransomware-decryptor.html) [AtomSilo, and LockFile ransomware.](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/123854/malware/atomsilo-lockfile-ransomware-decryptor.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Pierluigi Paganini](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559)**\n\n**[(SecurityAffairs –](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)** **hacking, TargetCompany ransomware)**\n\nYou might also like\n\n**[Experts believe that Russian Gamaredon APT could fuel a new round of DDoS attacks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131762/apt/gamaredon-apt-ddos-attacks.html)**\n\nMay 28, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\n\n-----\n\n**[The strange link between Industrial Spy and the Cuba ransomware operation](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131754/cyber-crime/industrial-spy-cuba-ransomware.html)**\n\nMay 28, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\nCopyright 2021 Security Affairs by Pierluigi Paganini All Right Reserved.\nBack to top\n\n[Home](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)\n[Cyber Crime](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-crime)\n[Cyber warfare](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-warfare-2)\n[APT](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/apt)\n[Data Breach](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/data-breach)\n[Deep Web](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/deep-web)\n[Digital ID](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/digital-id)\n[Hacking](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacking)\n[Hacktivism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacktivism)\n[Intelligence](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/intelligence)\n[Internet of Things](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/iot)\n[Laws and regulations](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/laws-and-regulations)\n[Malware](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/malware)\n[Mobile](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/mobile-2)\n[Reports](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/reports)\n[Security](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/security)\n[Social Networks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/social-networks)\n[Terrorism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/terrorism)\n[ICS-SCADA](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/ics-scada)\n[EXTENDED COOKIE POLICY](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/extended-cookie-policy)\n[Contact me](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/contact)\n\n\n-----",
