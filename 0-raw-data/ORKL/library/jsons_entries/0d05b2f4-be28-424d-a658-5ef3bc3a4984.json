Our research indicates that\n\n these four interconnected malware tools are elements of\n\n much larger mAPT (mobile advanced persistent threat)\n\n campaigns that have been active for years. Although there\n\n is evidence that the campaigns have been active since at\n\n least 2013, Lookout researchers have been monitoring\n\n the surveillanceware families — SilkBean, DoubleAgent,\n\n CarbonSteal and GoldenEagle — as far back as 2015.\n\n The mAPT threat actors behind this activity possess a mobile\n\n arsenal containing at least four other Android surveillance\n\n tools publicly known as HenBox[1], PluginPhantom[2], Spywaller[3]\n\n and DarthPusher[4]. By examining the surveillanceware apps,\n\n their signing certificates and supporting command and\n\n control (C2) infrastructure, we have discovered connections\n\n between these malware tools and the actors behind them\n\n which we detail in this report.\n\n Evidence suggests that some of the mAPT activity described\n\n in this report is also publicly associated with desktop APT\n\n activity in China[5], a theme which is increasingly common with\n\n mobile malware tooling.\n\n Lookout researchers have evidence to suggest that while\n\n the main target of this activity is indeed the Uyghur ethnic\n\n minority in China, these tools have also been used to\n\n target Uyghurs living outside China, Tibetans, and Muslim\n\n populations around the world.\n\n[1 https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-henbox-chickens-come-home-roost/](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n\n###### Titles and in-app functionality suggest targets speak a\n\n variety of languages including: Uyghur (in all its four scripts:\n\n Arabic, Russian, Uyghur Cyrillic and Chinese), English, Arabic,\n\n Chinese, Turkish, Pashto, Persian, Malay, Indonesian, Uzbek\n\n and Urdu/Hindi.\n\n The development timeline and targeting of these families\n\n also appear to align with Chinese national security directives\n\n and “counter-terrorism” efforts as defined by the Chinese\n\n government, perhaps suggesting a broader strategic goal\n\n behind the campaign. Lookout researchers have observed\n\n a peak in malware development beginning in 2015, which\n\n coincides with the “Strike Hard Campaign against Violent\n\n Terrorism” (严厉打击暴力恐怖活动专项行动) campaign in\n\n Xinjiang that began in May 2014, as well as the creation of the\n\n National Security Strategic Guidelines, the National Security\n\n Law and the Counterterrorism Law in 2015[6].\n\n Additionally, the languages, countries, and services that were\n\n observed targeted by the mAPT are in line with China’s official\n\n list of “26 Sensitive Countries,” which according to public\n\n reporting, has been used by Chinese authorities as targeting\n\n criteria. During our research, we found evidence of at least 14\n\n of the 26 countries being targeted by the malware campaigns\n\n discussed in this report.\n\n\n[2 https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-pluginphantom-new-android-trojan-abuses-droidplugin-framework/](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n[3 https://blog.lookout.com/spywaller-mobile-threat](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n[4 https://thehackernews.com/2015/03/Xiaomi-Mi-4-malware.html](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n[5 https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/09/forced-to-adapt-xslcmd-backdoor-now-on-os-x.html](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n[6 https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/Chinas%20Response%20to%20Terrorism_CNA061616.pdf](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n[7 https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/09/09/eradicating-ideological-viruses/chinas-campaign-repression-against-xinjiangs](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Map showing the countries targeted by the mAPT activity discussed in this report.\n\n\n###### A sample of DoubleAgent has previously been reported\n\n to target the Tibetan people[8] and evidence found in our\n\n investigation suggests the surveillanceware classified as\n\n GoldenEagle may also target the same group. While SilkBean\n\n is a relatively small and targeted family for Uyghur individuals,\n\n shared infrastructure between SilkBean and DoubleAgent\n\n suggests that the two are operated by the same actor and\n\n have been for many years. That same infrastructure has also\n\n been seen communicating with samples of the malware\n\n families CarbonSteal, HenBox, PhantomPlugin, Spywaller and\n\n DarthPusher.\n\n\n###### Users of the Lookout mobile security products are protected\n\n from all these threats. According to our data, none of the\n\n malicious apps covered by this report here were available on\n\n Google Play.\n\n\n[8 https://citizenlab.ca/2013/04/permission-to-spy-an-analysis-of-android-malware-targeting-tibetans/](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PluginPhantom DarthPusher HenBox FireEye GREF report\n C2 C2\n Signed C2\n C2\n samples\n\n Signed\n C2 C2 samples\n\n SilkBean Shared DoubleAgent Signing Shared C2 IP delivering infrastructure certificates XSLCmd malware\n\n Signed\n C2 samples\n Shares C2 IP address\n\n Spywaller GoldenEagle Shared unique CarbonSteal\n WeChat ID\n\n Unique code overlap\n\n Map showing the countries targeted by the mAPT activity discussed in this report.\n\n\n[9 https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/09/forced-to-adapt-xslcmd-backdoor-now-on-os-x.html](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Key Findings\n\n###### Four new Android surveillanceware tools have been\n\n discovered by Lookout.\n\n • The primary aim of these surveillanceware apps is to\n\n gather and exfiltrate personal user data to a command\n\n and control server.\n\n • The apps fall into four separate malware families, each\n\n of which has its own unique data gathering priorities\n\n and techniques. We named these families SilkBean,\n\n DoubleAgent, CarbonSteal and GoldenEagle.\n\n • Lookout researchers can trace some of the associated\n\n infrastructure as far back as 2013, along with changes   \n\n in tooling.\n\n • These surveillanceware tools have been used in\n\n conjunction with previously reported malware    \n\n families such as HenBox, PluginPhantom, Spywaller   \n\n and Darth Pusher.\n\n Targets of these malware families are primarily Uyghurs, both\n\n in China and around the world, but also include Tibetans and\n\n possibly wider Muslim communities.\n\n • Application titles and in-app functionality of the malware\n\n samples suggest the targets of all four surveillanceware\n\n families are the Uyghur Muslim ethnic minority group,\n\n centered in Xinjiang, China. Some applications and C2\n\n domains appear to impersonate third-party Uyghur\n\n language app stores and focus on Uyghur-targeted apps\n\n and services.\n\n • Evidence suggests Uyghur communities in at least\n\n fourteen other countries may also be targeted. Content\n\n within malware samples reference local services and\n\n news outlets in countries such as Turkey, Syria, Kuwait,\n\n Indonesia and Kazakhstan.\n\n\n\n###### • DoubleAgent and GoldenEagle also target Tibetans,\n\n inferred from their titles as well as public reporting.[10]\n\n • Application titles have also been seen in at least 10\n\n different languages - Uyghur (in all its four scripts:\n\n Arabic, Russian, Uyghur Cyrillic and Chinese), English,\n\n Arabic, Chinese, Turkish, Pashto, Persian, Malay,\n\n Indonesian, Uzbek and Urdu/Hindi.\n\n All four malware families are connected to each other\n\n through shared command and control infrastructure,\n\n signing certificates as well as code and target overlap.\n\n • Samples of DoubleAgent, GoldenEagle and SilkBean\n\n share C2 infrastructure indicating that the same actor \n\n is behind the deployment of these malware tools.\n\n • Infrastructure publicly associated with the actor known\n\n as GREF in 2018 has been found to be linked directly to\n\n CarbonSteal samples. In past public reporting, GREF\n\n has also been referred to as APT15, Ke3chang, Mirage,\n\n Vixen Panda and Playful Dragon.\n\n • Overlap of non-compromised signing certificates\n\n indicates that a combination of these tools are being\n\n used in tandem by a single group of mAPT actors to\n\n target Uyghurs and other Muslim populations around\n\n the world.\n\n\n[10 https://citizenlab.ca/2013/04/permission-to-spy-an-analysis-of-android-malware-targeting-tibetans/](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n\n-----\n\n## SilkBean\n\n#### Findings\n\n###### In January 2019, Lookout researchers began investigating\n\n SilkBean, a small and targeted Android surveillanceware tool\n\n focusing on the Turkic minority ethnic group, the Uyghurs. \n\n The malware samples mainly trojanized applications for\n\n Uyghur/Arabic focused keyboards, alphabets, and plugins.\n\n A hallmark of SilkBean is the comprehensive RAT (remote\n\n access trojan) functionality that allows an attacker to execute\n\n over 70 different commands on an infected device. SilkBean is\n\n delivered via applications that possess malicious functionality,\n\n but mimic titles and icons that a target may want to install. \n\n The legitimate app with functionality the user expects is\n\n packaged within the malware and installed after SilkBean\n\n successfully infects a target device.\n\n Tracking SilkBean throughout 2019 led to the discovery that\n\n the actor behind this malware had a much larger Android\n\n toolset than was previously thought, and had also perhaps\n\n expanded their target group. Malware samples connected by\n\n common command and control infrastructure over a number\n\n of years suggests that the same group behind the activity of\n\n SilkBean was also making use of the malware families known\n\n as DarthPusher[11], HenBox[12], PluginPhantom[13] and the next\n\n surveillanceware family presented here: DoubleAgent.\n\n[11 https://www.androidphons.com/malware-spotted-xiaomi-mi4-smartphones/](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n[12 https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-henbox-chickens-come-home-roost/](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n\n###### The languages used in the titles and in-app content include:\n\n Uyghur (in all its four scripts: Arabic, Russian, Uyghur Cyrillic,\n\n and Chinese), English, Arabic, Chinese, Turkish, Pashto,\n\n Persian, Malay, Indonesian, and Urdu/Hindi. Locations\n\n referenced in these titles also point to individuals living in\n\n or visiting countries such as Syria, Kuwait, Indonesia and\n\n Turkey. Many topics reference either popular Muslim apps\n\n or applications that individuals who are interested in Islam\n\n might find entertaining. Other titles and domains reference\n\n legitimate services, websites and third party app stores that\n\n serve Uyghur-relevant content only.\n\n Logging statements indicate that the developers of SilkBean\n\n speak Chinese. Chinese names and locations are also\n\n mentioned in non-compromised signer certificates used\n\n to sign samples of this malware, although this information\n\n is easy to falsify during development. Similarities in coding\n\n techniques and naming conventions between SilkBean and\n\n other known Chinese-developed malware families also add\n\n weight to this theory.\n\n\n[13 https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-pluginphantom-new-android-trojan-abuses-droidplugin-framework/](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Targeting\n\n###### The majority of SilkBean samples acquired by Lookout in 2016 and 2017 have titles like com.google.pay and com.android.\n\n google.service, which the average user might find innocuous on an Android device. Most later samples had app icons and titles\n\n identifying them as Uyghur targeted as shown in the following figure.\n\n\n###### While at least two samples have a direct reference to Uyghur specific applications, such as Uyghur Keyboard, (Uyghur) Alphabet and Uyghur\n\n Plugin, one is titled “ئىستىقالل ” which may be loosely translated as “Independence” in Arabic. Another recent sample is titled TalkBox, a push\n to-talk messaging application commonly used in China.\n\n\n###### A SilkBean sample (SHA-1: 3da34aaf95ffcb5c5d36c2a9fc5 42c1b08c36d2f) uncovered in June 2019 prompted a closer look\n\n at the family. It had the title “         ”, which translates to “Syria News” in Arabic. Despite the app title, the content of the اخبار سوريا\n\n application was still specifically Uyghur-focused - all news stories could be viewed in the three different scripts used for the\n\n Uyghur language.\n\n Icons and screenshots of\n\n SilkBean samples which are\n\n examples of language-specific\n\n targeting used by this threat,\n\n where the same news article is\n\n presented in a number of Uyghur\n\n language scripts.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Screenshots from a sample of\n\n SilkBean masquerading as a\n\n Uyghur Keyboard application.\n\n The first stage of the application\n\n asks the user for an update\n\n immediately and uses this\n\n opportunity to install another\n\n application which contains\n\n legitimate functionality, also\n\n retrieved from it’s assets folder\n\n (non-rooted device functionality).\n\n The application does not attempt\n\n to hide its icon either. As is\n\n discussed later however, the\n\n current C2 content encourages\n\n users to disable this security\n\n setting and allow app installs\n\n from unknown locations.\n\n#### Malware details\n\n###### Apps belonging to the SilkBean family have extensive surveillance and remote-control capabilities as is evident from the following\n\n list of 70 commands the app can receive from its C2 and perform.\n\n\n###### CMD_ADDRESSBOOK CMD_ADDRESSBOOK_DEL CMD_ADDRESSBOOK_INFO CMD_AUTO_SCREEN_STATE CMD_BASICINFO_GET CMD_BASICINFO_SET CMD_BROWSER_DATA_DEL CMD_BROWSER_DATA_GET CMD_CALL_GEAR CMD_CALL_RECORD CMD_CALL_RECORD_DEL CMD_CALL_RECORD_TOP CMD_CHANG_TOKEN CMD_CONTROLLER_CONNECT CMD_CONTROLLER_VERIFY CMD_ENVIRONMENT_RECORD CMD_GPS CMD_HEARTBEAT CMD_INSTALL_APP CMD_INSTALL_APP_DEL CMD_INSTALL_APP_NORM_DEL CMD_INSTALL_APP_SETUP CMD_MESSAGE\n\n\n###### CMD_MESSAGE_DEL CMD_MESSAGE_MODIFY CMD_MESSAGE_SEND CMD_PHONE_BLOCK CMD_PHONE_BLOCK_DELLOG CMD_PHONE_BLOCK_GET CMD_PHONE_BLOCK_GETLOG CMD_PHONE_CAMERA_GET CMD_PHONE_IM_DEL CMD_PHONE_IM_GET CMD_PHONE_MAIL_ATTACH CMD_PHONE_MAIL_BODY CMD_PHONE_MAIL_DEL CMD_PHONE_MAIL_GET CMD_PHONE_RECORD CMD_PHONE_RECORD_FILES CMD_PHONE_SWITCH_MACHINE CMD_PHONE_WEIBO_DEL CMD_PHONE_WEIBO_GET CMD_PLUG_DELETE CMD_PLUG_PATH_GET CMD_PLUG_VER_QUERY CMD_RECORD_APP\n\n\n###### CMD_RECORD_FILES CMD_RECORD_FILES_DEL CMD_RECORD_RECORD_GET CMD_RECORD_WATCHAPPFILES CMD_RUNNING_APP CMD_RUNNING_APP_STOP CMD_SDCARD CMD_SDCARD_DEL CMD_SDCARD_DOWNLOAD CMD_SDCARD_GET_FILES CMD_SDCARD_MVFILE CMD_SDCARD_RENAME CMD_SDCARD_RUN CMD_SDCARD_UPLOAD CMD_SOCKETCLOSE CMD_TROJAN_AUTOCONFIG CMD_TROJAN_AUTOSEND CMD_TROJAN_CONNECT CMD_TROJAN_INFORMATION CMD_UPDATE_THEIR_BYURL CMD_WATCHAPP_RECORD_ADD CMD_WATCHAPP_RECORD_DEL CMD_WATCHAPP_RECORD_SYN\n\n\n###### The list of all commands that can be received and processed by SilkBean samples. Note the get and delete\n\n commands for Weibo information on an infected device, which is a popular social media site in China.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Many samples of SilkBean had most of their malicious functionality in a second stage and read command and control\n\n information from a settings file in the assets folder.\n\n\n{\n\n“App_run_name”:””,\n“Aram_type”:”true”,\n“backup_path”:”www.englishedu-online.com:7082;213.128.81.82:7082;”,\n“Client_type”:”3”,\n“Install_type”:2,\n“Mm_group”:”attack_2”,\n“mm_path”:”C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\ryingsoft\\\\mmserver\\\\data\\\\center\\\\\nmm\\\\9365e76b-f9e3-4ac7-881f-c93ab1077a60.apk”,\n\n“Mm_type”:0,\n“Notfiy_phone”:””,\n“Os_type”:0,\n“other_path”:”C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\ryingsoft\\\\mmserver\\\\data\\\\center\\\\\nmm\\\\aa42b5bb-f43e-4841-80cd-917680909614.apk”,\n\n“Port”:7082,\n“Rs_type”:”3”,\n“server_ip”:”www.turkyedu-online.com”,\n“Sock_type”:0,\n“Update_config”:\n{\n\n“Call_type”:2431,\n“Cyc_time”:”60”,\n“Save_path”:”c:\\\\auto_path”,\n“Screen_state”:1,\n“Start_time”:”22:00”,\n“Stop_time”:”23:00”,\n“Time_type”:1,\n“trans_type”:”WIFI ONLY”\n},\n“Use_weixin”:0,\n“version”:”2016-02-18new”\n}\n\n###### Top: Files seen in the assets folder of a sample of SilkBean. The file 112 is a sqlite database used to store some data for the application. The file\n\n 113 is the second stage and contains malicious functionality. com.kittyhomes.uyghurinputkeyboard is the application that contains legitimate\n\n functionality and setting.prop is the encrypted file containing C2 information. Bottom: In all cases, this settings file is encrypted using a set\n\n of bitwise shifting operations. Once decrypted, it contains a JSON Object, similar to the one shown above. The values of the “mm_path” and\n\n “other_path” keys may contain clues about the developer’s build environment. “ryingsoft” is also a string found in signer certificate details of\n\n many SilkBean samples, possibly a reference to an IT company with the same name, based in Shanghai[14].\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Command and control infrastructure and possible distribution mechanisms\n\n\n###### Two C2 server domains retrieved from the settings files from\n\n SilkBean samples are www.englishedu-online[.]com and\n\n www.turkyedu-online[.]com. Navigating to these sites early\n\n on in the investigation redirected the request to a third-party\n\n app store called www.islamapk[.]com which hosts Uyghur\n\n and Islamic specific applications for download.\n\n More recently however, navigating to these sites directs the\n\n user to an exact copy of http://video.overxtube[.]com, an\n\n adult content site, which also resolves to the same IP address\n\n as the SilkBean C2s. Site content encourages users to modify\n\n Android security settings, thereby allowing the installation of\n\n applications from an “Unknown Source”.\n\n All applications offered on this site (SHA-1:\n\n eea64762788a3df961dc83ff5d48f227eddb8f25,\n\n 5deaaa31ac24bced0215287c6dd74a0ba71abdc9,\n\n None of the APKs downloaded from the site during the\n\n investigation were malicious, although a significant fraction\n\n of the links were either not accessible or the target files did\n\n not exist. Lookout also began ingesting the same APKs found\n\n\n###### 1fbc8c3abcc0e70743e182bc34ba2b459935d2f3) are signed\n\n with a compromised key, but do not appear to contain any\n\n malicious functionality consistent with SilkBean and also do\n\n not have surveillanceware capabilities. However, all three\n\n applications have the capability to install an application\n\n package. This is a behavior explicitly explained away by\n\n the content on the web site as an expected “update” of the\n\n app. This behavior might provide insight into a possible\n\n distribution mechanism for the malicious apps.\n\n Lastly, accessing either of the C2 servers over an HTTPS\n\n connection again redirected the user to islamapk[.]com.\n\n However, the site content delivered on this site appeared\n\n to impersonate yet another third-party app store, yurdax[.]\n\n com. It is possible that the targets for SilkBean may already be\n\n familiar with this site and this made infecting their devices with\n\n SilkBean easier.\n\n\n###### on SilkBean C2 servers from other sources shortly before\n\n new samples of SilkBean started appearing in August 2018.\n\n The temporal correlation suggests that the site and malware\n\n campaign were being updated in parallel.\n\n\n###### A screenshot taken during the investigation\n\n of https://www.islamapk[.]com/ which\n\n is exactly identical in content to http://\n\n yurdax[.]com/android/.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Lookout researchers also uncovered six applications\n\n requesting invasive permissions that connect to islamapk[.]\n\n com, with very telling package names as to who is being\n\n targeted. Two of the applications are known SilkBean\n\n samples, while the remaining are not yet classified into\n\n any known families, but appear to look for a second stage\n\n download from islamapk[.]com, which at the time of writing\n\n could not be accessed. Two of the applications’ package\n\n names are com.uyghur.hunter.islamapk, and the other two\n\n are com.islamapk.uy, which is consistent with the targeting of\n\n Uyghurs that Lookout researchers have seen.\n\n\n###### Connections to Other Uyghur-targeted Surveillanceware\n\n The detailed investigation into SilkBean apps and\n\n infrastructure provided the starting point for piecing\n\n together the different elements of this mAPT into a larger\n\n picture. Starting from the IP address (213.128.81[.]82) of\n\n the two previously mentioned C2 servers of SilkBean (www.\n\n englishedu-online[.]com and www.turkyedu-online[.]com) we\n\n found that a number of similar C2 servers had also resolved\n\n to the same IP address. This resolution has not changed since\n\n January 2016 (for turkyedu-online[.]com) and October 2017\n\n (for www.englishedu-online[.]com).\n\n\n###### A Maltego graph showing the resolutions of SilkBean’s C2 domains to the IP addresses 213.128.81[.]82 and 31.210.106[.]90 as well as some\n\n other domains resolving to the same IPs since February 2016. This image was compiled using RiskIQ’s Passive DNS data. OSINT[15] and RiskIQ[16]\n\n research indicates that uyghurappbazar[.]com and overxtube[.]com are already publicly associated with Android malware[17]. Many sites have a\n\n naming convention with the pattern “*edu-online.com” and the rest appear to contain innocuous names or reference Uyghur-specific content,\n\n such as otkaxbazar[.]com.\n\n\n[15 https://www.malwareurl.com/ns_listing.php?as=AS197328](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### By retroactively searching Lookout’s app database for apps\n\n communicating with domains seen in the above graph, a C2\n\n domain pattern “*edu-online.com” emerged as a common\n\n theme for many associated domain names this actor has made\n\n use of. From this, Lookout researchers uncovered hundreds of\n\n\n###### samples communicating with these domains, not all of which\n\n are SilkBean surveillanceware. In fact, the majority of these\n\n downloaded samples belong to malware from the families\n\n DarthPusher, HenBox and PluginPhantom.\n\n\n###### exploration leading 204 New\n englishedu-online.com\n to new domains Applications\n\n turkyedu-online.com\n\n Phantom\n HenBox Plugin\n\n Flowchart highlighting the connection from SilkBean infrastructure to new APK samples tied to three other malware families, DarthPusher,\n\n PhantomPlugin and HenBox.\n\n\n###### DarthPusher[18] is classified by Lookout as an app dropper, i.e.\n\n malware with capability that can arbitrarily install an Android\n\n APK. An adversary can use this capability to push any piece of\n\n surveillanceware to an intended target device.\n\n PluginPhantom[19], or IHide, was found to contain many\n\n separate Android applications hidden within its resources.\n\n Each surveillance function of the malware, such as collecting\n\n call logs, location, SMS messages and more, was divided\n\n into separate APKs that were then loaded through the\n\n “DroidPlugin” framework for Android. Location tracking\n\n functions used only Baidu libraries and most debugging\n\n[18 https://www.androidphons.com/malware-spotted-xiaomi-mi4-smartphones/](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n\n###### statements appeared to be in Chinese. Lookout researchers\n\n also noticed overlap with other Chinese-developed code from\n\n IronButler and SpyWaller malware, which continues the trend\n\n of heavily reusing already existing malware tooling by the\n\n actor behind SilkBean.\n\n HenBox[20,21], is a previously discovered surveillanceware\n\n already known to target the Uyghur community. We can only\n\n attribute a small subset of these apps to the SilkBean actor\n\n through the use of shared infrastructure and the similarity of\n\n the used domains to the previously mentioned pattern.\n\n\n[19 https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-pluginphantom-new-android-trojan-abuses-droidplugin-framework/](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n[20 https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-henbox-chickens-come-home-roost/](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n[21 https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-henbox-inside-coop/](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Branching out from WHOIS information, C2 domains,\n\n and IP resolutions, Lookout researchers were able to find\n\n other potential C2 domains in use by the actor behind this\n\n tooling using the same targets and patterns.

Many of the domains collected during our research above appear to\n\n suggest hosting content for third party app stores. For example, Oztil App Baziri appears to be yet another Uyghur-focused third party app store (www.\n\n oztil.com), and also has been seen in other HenBox and DarthPusher titles. In fact, there are so many potential app stores that, without further insight into\n\n the targeted community, it is difficult to discern if any of these are legitimate stores or malicious watering holes impersonating legitimate stores.\n\n\n###### As shown in the table above, the titles and languages used in\n\n these applications imply targeting of these malware families\n\n over a wide geographic area. There are titles in at least ten\n\n different languages, and many samples reference services in\n\n a number of countries around the world. While many apps are\n\n of interest to Muslims in general, Uyghur populations abroad\n\n in these geographic regions have reportedly continued to see\n\n targeting by the Chinese government [27,28,29].\n\n At least eighteen third-party app stores were found during\n\n this investigation, all serving pages in Uyghur and Arabic.\n\n\n###### Among some other general and utility apps, these stores also\n\n contained apps specific to the Uyghur population or persons\n\n practicing Islam. If at least some samples of SilkBean were\n\n intended for Uyghur targets residing in China, the heavy\n\n use of third-party app stores makes sense since the Google\n\n Play store is not available in the region. Secure messaging\n\n applications such as WhatsApp and Voxer could also be\n\n downloaded from these stores, but are not malicious and\n\n appear to be popular, modified versions of those legitimate\n\n applications.\n\n\n[27 https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/800118582/i-thought-it-would-be-safe-uighurs-in-turkey-now-fear-china-s-long-arm](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n[28 https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/02/china-uyghurs-living-abroad-tell-of-campaign-of-intimidation/](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n[29 https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FP 20190930 china counterterrorism byman saber-1.pdf](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Screenshots depicting some of the many third-party app stores found\n\n focusing on persons that speak Uyghur or practice Islam.\n\n\n###### There was one group of malicious applications whose\n\n details are not described in this section. Applications that\n\n communicate to turknews-online[.]com stood out to Lookout\n\n researchers as a completely different piece of malware. These\n\n are samples from a long-running family Lookout researchers\n\n have been tracking called DoubleAgent, described next in this\n\n report. Titles and functionality were particularly noteworthy as\n\n they display content from islamapk[.]com and yurdax[.]com,\n\n previously associated with SilkBean C2 server content. The\n\n most recent samples ingested by Lookout were initially found\n\n\n###### on VirusTotal and were uploaded through IPs located in US,\n\n Germany, and Korea in March and June of 2019.\n\n There are also malware samples communicating to the\n\n C2 server babyedu-online[.]com which belong to a\n\n surveillanceware known as GoldenEagle, described in the\n\n last section of this report.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### It appears to be important to the threat actor using SilkBean to\n\n blend into the background noise while infecting their targets,\n\n and that is a recurring theme in their design choices. Many\n\n samples were signed with compromised signing certificates,\n\n and the campaigns involving SilkBean uses known and\n\n abundant malware (DarthPusher, Spywaller) to accomplish\n\n their tasks, perhaps so that there is no unique tooling to tie\n\n to them. Where custom tooling is used, it is blended into\n\n apps that may be downloaded by their targets, as well as\n\n making them as geographically and linguistically-specific as\n\n possible. There is also evidence that the actor has deliberately\n\n made use of titles, package names, and emails (found in\n\n WHOIS information) that mimic the names of popular Uyghur\n\n individuals and activists. For example,\n\n which was used to link may C2 domains together, may be\n\n referring to Alimjan Yimit[30], a Uyghur christian clergyman who\n\n was imprisoned in 2008.\n\n Campaigns associated with SilkBean also appear to be long\n running, at least since 2015, and this shows patience and\n\n perseverance by the operator in question. It also appears\n\n that this mobile tool is not only used to target the Uyghur\n\n population within China, but also around the world in\n\n countries such as Turkey, Syria, Kuwait, Indonesia, Malaysia,\n\n Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\n## DoubleAgent\n\n#### Findings\n\n###### In 2013 Citizen Lab reported on a compromised version of\n\n KakaoTalk[31], which had been used to target a prominent\n\n individual in the Tibetan community. This app was the\n\n first publicly exposed sample of a malware family called\n\n DoubleAgent. When Lookout initially investigated\n\n DoubleAgent in 2015, it was already an advanced Android\n\n remote access tool (RAT). Early versions of this family\n\n trojanized apps such as Voxer and TalkBox, as well as Amaq\n\n[30 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alimjan Yimit](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n\n###### News, the official Daesh news application. The extent of this\n\n malware family and its connections to other campaigns has\n\n not been publicly reported on until now. Lookout researchers\n\n have seen DoubleAgent used exclusively against groups with\n\n contentious relationships with the Chinese government.\n\n Although Lookout has been tracking this malware family for\n\n many years, new samples discovered in the last year indicated\n\n that the actors behind DoubleAgent were continuing to evolve\n\n the surveillanceware and use new infrastructure. However,\n\n they maintained the same targeting, as well as several key\n\n malware characteristics, such as similar decryption keys for\n\n configuration files.\n\n These recent samples, discovered in late 2019, are the\n\n focus of this section on DoubleAgent. A decryption of the\n\n configuration files from these samples revealed a direct\n\n overlap in C2 infrastructure between the operators of\n\n DoubleAgent and SilkBean at a time when both malware\n\n families appeared to be active. The C2s found also confirmed\n\n our findings that other domains resolving to the IP address\n\n 213.128.81[.]82 since February 2016 were part of the same\n\n actor’s infrastructure. This leads us to believe that the same\n\n actor is behind the use of DoubleAgent and SilkBean.\n\n Titles also suggest targeting of the DoubleAgent family has\n\n included the Uyghur population, with these most recent\n\n samples masquerading as third-party Android app stores\n\n (islamapk[.]com and yurdax[.]com) serving Uyghur-focused\n\n applications and overlapping with C2 content seen when\n\n investigating SilkBean. Consistent use of domain names that\n\n fit the pattern “*-online.com” was also noted across both these\n\n families.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Malware details\n\n Each DoubleAgent sample comes with an encrypted file in\n\n the assets folder that contains configuration information for\n\n the malware and its command and control servers. On launch,\n\n the malware Base64 decodes the file, most recently disguised\n\n with the name “GoogleMusic.png”. This decoded text is then\n\n decrypted with a key formed by joining two strings hardcoded\n\n in the sample. MessageDigest is used to calculate the MD5 of\n\n this string, which is then used as the final key when decrypting\n\n the configuration file using the AES algorithm.\n\n\n###### Contents of the decrypted configuration file are split by a\n\n sequence of hash signs (“###” or “####”) and then dollar\n\n signs (“$$$$$”). This allows the malware to parse out C2\n\n information, decryption/encryption keys, beaconing and\n\n timeout periods, among other configuration details on how\n\n the malware is run on an infected device..\n\n\n###### androidapps.spdns.org:990 $$$$$comix_Qove $$$$$HaPyzi0o825-$^ $$$$$1 ####android.apps.us.to:990 $$$$$comix_Qove $$$$$HaPyzi0o825-$^ $$$$$1 ####androidapps.nsupdate.info:990 $$$$$holder-Peoq $$$$$PhyOZ915_#@ $$$$$1 ####android.app.info.tm:990 $$$$$holder-Peoq $$$$$PhyOZ915_#@ $$$$$1 ####http://heartsys.dnsapi.info ####30 ####600 ####21600 ####60 ####on\n\n Decrypted contents of early configuration files called “google.ind”.\n\n [{“IP”:”www.turknews-online.com”,”port”:9701},{“IP”:”www.cookedu-online.com”,”port”:9701},{“IP”:”www.turknews- online.com”,”port”:9701},{“IP”:”192.168.10.108”,”port”:9080}]####600####60####on\n\n Configuration file formats appear to have changed slightly in more recent versions. The C2 list is now an array of JSON objects and the FTP\n\n server information is omitted. In this particular sample, the C2 server is turknews-online[.]com, a C2 domain tied to SilkBean.\n\n\n###### Early versions of DoubleAgent used FTP servers as staging\n\n areas for exfiltrated content and required infected devices\n\n to authenticate with credentials from the decrypted text\n\n file. In addition to serving as a staging area for exfiltrated\n\n information, the FTP servers also hold files containing specific\n\n instructions that a device should carry out in the future.\n\n When an infected device beacons to C2 infrastructure it will\n\n check the FTP server for files with the format <device IMEI>.\n\n fmd. These files contain commands for a discrete action like\n\n uploading a file, enabling a service such as audio recording,\n\n searching directories for specific files, or installing additional\n\n applications.\n\n\n###### Newer versions of DoubleAgent upload files, unencrypted,\n\n directly to the C2 servers using TCP sockets. Although the\n\n usual list of surveillance data is pulled and inserted into SQLite\n\n databases on the device (such as system information, calls,\n\n contacts, SMS texts, apps installed, browsing history, and\n\n more), it is not uploaded unless instructed by the C2 which\n\n indicates that the actor behind DoubleAgent prefers handling\n\n data exfiltration carefully, likely to avoid detection.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### In addition, DoubleAgent also pulls the list of files, where\n\n possible, from the following set of locations when instructed\n\n to do so via C2 commands. It also monitors any changes and\n\n logs them in a SQLite database locally on the device.\n\n • /data/data/com.google.android.gm/shared_prefs\n\n (Gmail app)\n\n • /data/data/com.google.android.gm/databases\n\n (Gmail app)\n\n • /data/data/com.android.email/shared_prefs\n\n (Default email app)\n\n • /data/data/com.android.email/databases\n\n (Default email app)\n\n • /data/data/com.dropbox.android/databases\n\n (Dropbox app)\n\n • /data/system\n\n • /DCIM\n\n • /Pictures\n\n Some samples of DoubleAgent feature code for downloading\n\n exploits in order to root the phone and install additional\n\n malware as a system app. Specifically, Lookout has seen the\n\n authors using TowelRoot in order to gain privileged access on\n\n victim devices and install additional malware on /system. This\n\n technique makes it difficult for the typical user to clean their\n\n device if infected.\n\n Messages received from the C2 can contain an object that\n\n specifies two things: a number representing one of up to 39\n\n commands handled by the malware, and optionally a String\n\n object that specifies any further parameters, each separated\n\n by a sequence of hash signs (‘#’).\n\n\n###### The most noteworthy RAT capabilities found to be present in\n\n these new samples are discussed below:\n\n • Runs arbitrary shell commands with or without root\n\n privileges, as specified by the C2 and returns the output\n\n of the command.\n\n • Remounts system as Read-Write, installs a file as a system\n\n app at the location /system/app/GoogleMail.apk, and\n\n remounts /system back to Read-Only permissions if it has\n\n root.\n\n • Installs a specified APK after a specified number of\n\n seconds.\n\n • Hides or unhides app icon.\n\n • Updates C2 configuration.\n\n • Gathers a list of running apps and a list of apps in the\n\n foreground.\n\n • Creates, deletes, and renames specific files.\n\n • Records calls as .amr files, and zips them before sending\n\n the archive file out to the C2 server.\n\n • Has the ability to kill its background service if needed,\n\n likely either to avoid detection or save battery.\n\n • Stores all exfiltrated data in database (.db) files on the\n\n device.\n\n • Has a database to track what files need to be uploaded\n\n to or downloaded from the C2 server, as specified by\n\n commands provided to the malware.\n\n • Can either automatically or when directed by the C2 copy\n\n and upload data of popular communications applications,\n\n depending on the DoubleAgent sample.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Talkbox\n\n DiDi (rideshare app in China)\n\n Keechat\n\n Coco\n\n Voxer\n\n\n###### WhatsApp\n\n Airetalk\n\n Viber\n\n Telegram\n\n Zello (Push to talk)\n\n\n###### Skype\n\n QQ\n\n MicroMsg\n\n MagicCall (Voice Changer app)\n\n BBM\n\n\n###### List of applications whose files or databases are uploaded to DoubleAgent C2 servers of DoubleAgent samples seen in\n\n 2019. The malware also attempts to change the file permissions for all files under the /data/data/ directory of the above chat\n\n applications to permit read/write/execute for any UID.\n\n\n###### Instruction (command) 38, above, allows the attacker to execute a specified shell command along with an arbitrary number\n\n of parameters separated by a ‘###’ string, without requesting root permissions. ‘Kshell’ is the class in DoubleAgent\n\n responsible for executing shell commands with or without root permissions, as specified. If the command successfully gets\n\n executed, the output is sent back to the C2.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### DoubleAgent’s connection to other malware families\n\n In late 2019 novel DoubleAgent samples appeared that had\n\n evolved significantly from previous versions, and a closer\n\n look at their configuration and C2 infrastructure highlighted\n\n new connections to SilkBean, HenBox and DarthPusher. This\n\n strengthened the theory that the actor behind DoubleAgent\n\n is also involved in the deployment, and perhaps even\n\n development, of these other malware families.\n\n\n###### Icons of the newly uncovered DoubleAgent samples, which are\n\n titled “Disk photo recovery”, “SafeUM”, “Quran” and “Alphabet”,\n\n the last two being in line with past targeting profiles.\n\n\n###### Many of the new DoubleAgent samples in Lookout’s app database contained configuration files, which, when decrypted,\n\n contained links to known SilkBean C2 infrastructure.\n\n\n\n[{\n\n“IP”:”www.turknews-online.com”,\n“port”:9701\n},{\n\n“IP”:”www.cookedu-online.com”,\n“port”:9701\n},{\n\n“IP”:”www.turknews-online.com”,\n“port”:9701\n},{\n\n“IP”:”192.168.10.108”,\n“port”:9080\n}]\n####600####60####on\n\n\n\n[{\n\n“IP”:”www.turknews-online.com”,\n“Port”:9701\n},{\n\n“IP”:”176.31.115.156”,\n“port”:9701\n},{\n\n“IP”:”www.turknews-online.com”,\n“port”:9701\n},{\n\n“IP”:”176.31.115.156”,\n“port”:9701\n}]\n####600####60####off\n\n###### Two configurations found in recent DoubleAgent samples.\n\n The hardcoded IP address present in one of\n\n the DoubleAgent configurations is pointed\n\n to by two domains of interest: classone\n online[.]com and classedu-online[.]com. As\n\n shown in the previous section on SilkBean,\n\n the naming pattern “*edu-online[.]com” and\n\n “*-online[.]com” is consistent with the actor\n\n behind SilkBean as well as activity linked with\n\n the same actor also employing HenBox and\n\n PhantomPlugin malware families.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Four non-compromised signing certificates that signed\n\n samples of DoubleAgent were also used to sign applications\n\n belonging to the HenBox, DarthPusher and CarbonSteal\n\n Android surveillance families. CarbonSteal is another novel\n\n malware family described in the next section of this report.\n\n This confirms the theory that the actor behind the deployment\n\n and use of the samples of these malware families is the same.\n\n An overlap in validity dates of these signing certificates may\n\n also indicate that these tools were under development and\n\n use in the same timeframe, starting in early 2015.\n\n Finally, code similarities in these samples of SilkBean,\n\n HenBox, DarthPusher, CarbonSteal and DoubleAgent also\n\n suggest a common origin. For example, a malware sample\n\n (SHA-1: 1278654a7e6411f25c10a72e4db41468233ce519)\n\n first seen in late 2016 has unique code characteristics\n\n that belong to both HenBox and CarbonSteal, while\n\n being signed with a certificate that has also been used\n\n to sign DoubleAgent samples. Another sample (SHA-1:\n\n 61c0837583e9bfa915b7d897ed9d6b6c0faf7e4a), titled\n\n “Quran”, possesses code similarities between HenBox and\n\n DoubleAgent malware families, while also being signed\n\n with a certificate that was used to sign 48 other HenBox,\n\n DoubleAgent, DarthPusher and CarbonSteal samples. This is\n\n another indicator that these malware tools are being used in\n\n tandem by the same actor.\n\n## CarbonSteal\n\n#### Findings\n\n###### In March 2018, Palo Alto Networks released a report on a\n\n Chinese surveillanceware family named Henbox[32], which was\n\n found to be targeting minorities in China. When examining\n\n this research closely, Lookout found numerous IoCs (such\n\n as C2 and signer certificates) overlapping with another long\n\n running surveillanceware family, CarbonSteal, so named due\n\n to signer certificates containing the phrase Yǐtiān jiàn, that\n\n\n###### may be referring to a sword frequently advertised for sale as\n\n made from carbon steel.\n\n CarbonSteal is Android surveillanceware that has been\n\n tracked by Lookout since 2017, and more than 500 samples\n\n have been seen to date. While not as sophisticated as HenBox,\n\n certain samples of CarbonSteal do make use of a combination\n\n of native libraries and DEX classes, while others do not and are\n\n much simpler.\n\n Hallmarks of CarbonSteal include extensive audio recording\n\n functionality in a variety of codecs and audio formats, as well\n\n as the capability in later samples to control an infected device\n\n through specially crafted SMS messages. Attackers can also\n\n perform audio surveillance through the malware’s ability to\n\n silently answer a call from a specific phone number and allow\n\n the attacker to listen in to sounds around an infected device.\n\n Based on this functionality, we suspect that CarbonSteal\n\n might be deployed in areas with insufficient or no mobile data\n\n coverage.\n\n Samples of CarbonSteal and HenBox also use the same non\n compromised signing certificates in many cases, suggesting\n\n the actor behind their deployment is the same. Furthermore,\n\n overlapping validity dates of these certificates may indicate\n\n that the samples were produced around the same time frame.\n\n This evidence led Lookout researchers to the theory that these\n\n tools were primarily used in an ongoing malware campaign (at\n\n the time) and against similar targets, with titles and languages\n\n once again suggesting a Uyghur focused interest.\n\n Other overlaps in C2 and signer certificate IoCs indicate that\n\n tools such as DarthPusher and PhantomPlugin are also in this\n\n actor’s mobile surveillance arsenal. \n\n Lastly, a C2 IP address that communicated with CarbonSteal\n\n and HenBox samples was also observed communicating with\n\n samples of an OS X backdoor that was tied to GREF activity in\n\n 2014 by FireEye[33].\n\n\n[32 https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/03/unit42-henbox-chickens-come-home-roost/](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Malware details\n\n\n###### Titles for the vast majority of CarbonSteal samples are “设置”, which translates to “Setting”, however the operators behind this family\n\n also used various Google themed names and app icons for well known chat apps, VPN apps and popular games in China. They also\n\n impersonated Baidu apps (such as iQIYI, an online video platform based in Beijing and used by the Chinese Taiwan Affairs Office to\n\n further United Front (China) efforts)[34] and Izda, a Uyghur-focused search engine and content site. Titles such as “Quran”, “Dua” and\n\n “mullaim” also point to a Muslim focus of targets.\n\n\n###### CarbonSteal samples exhibit a high level of sophistication,\n\n with recent samples splitting their malicious functionality\n\n between native libraries and secondary APKs that get\n\n decrypted and loaded during execution, at times using\n\n reflection. Early samples appear to be based on the Dendroid\n\n malware family. Throughout its implementation, CarbonSteal\n\n maintains a focus on audio recording functionality and\n\n collection of data from chat applications popular in China.\n\n CarbonSteal samples contain an RC4 encrypted configuration\n\n file (usually config.txt or conf.txt) where information such as\n\n command and control details (IP/domain and port), a control\n\n phone number, and a UID are stored. Almost all samples also\n\n contain encrypted secondary JAR or DEX files in the assets\n\n folder, titled googlej.jpg and googles.jpg.\n\n On compromised devices, CarbonSteal samples have the\n\n following functionality:\n\n • Retrieve call logs.\n\n • Retrieve all SMS and MMS messages.\n\n[34 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQIYI](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n[35 https://github.com/MiCode](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n\n\n###### • Retrieve device metadata including model, manufacturer,\n\n product, sdcard size, and memory specs.\n\n • Retrieve disk usage information.\n\n • Retrieve CPU information including device serial number.\n\n • Retrieve QQ content from external storage.\n\n • Retrieve installed apps and when they were installed.\n\n • Retrieve notes and data from MiCode[35], a community-run,\n\n open source version of the Xiaomi sticky note app, and\n\n even masquerades as this application.\n\n • Receive out-of-band instructions via SMS from numbers\n\n specified in the configuration or retrieved from the C2.\n\n • Track the location of a device.\n\n • Remotely record audio.\n\n • Search external storage for various files such as audio\n\n recordings (.amr).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### • Call netcfg and get stats.\n\n • Log when the device is powered on and off.\n\n • Dynamically load additional functionality.\n\n • If the superuser binary is present, use it to silently install\n\n additional applications\n\n • Test for the Flyme operating systems or OPPO or VIVO\n\n phones in order to turn off various power saving features.\n\n\n###### CarbonSteal’s capability for operation without the use of\n\n mobile data or WiFi is particularly interesting. Apps of this\n\n family monitor the sender of incoming text messages and\n\n caller ID of incoming calls and match it against a number\n\n specified in the configuration file. If a call is received from\n\n the control phone number, the malware turns off the device’s\n\n ringer and answers the call immediately. This allows the\n\n operator of the control phone to listen in on the environment\n\n around the infected device. Once the call ends, the call log is\n\n deleted from call records on the device.\n\n CarbonSteal operators can also remotely control infected\n\n devices by sending them specially crafted text messages.

The retrieved data is sent back to the\n\n control phone number using SMS messages. CarbonSteal expects the control phone number to start with +86, which is the dialing code for China.\n\n Analysis of sample configurations only found one control phone number (158 7172 6845) specified for a small set of samples, which may belong to a\n\n mobile number segment operated by China Mobile in Wuhan City, Hubei Province.\n\n CarbonSteal samples are able to encode audio data into a variety of encodings, such as G711, G722 and Speex and store audio\n\n files in a variety of file formats, such as .amr, .raw, .wav and .gms3. CarbonSteal can send this audio data as complete recorded\n\n files through network sockets or by using RTP to stream data to a C2.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Audio and other data is stored at the following locations using\n\n timestamps as file names:\n\n • /mnt/sdcard/google/db/mp/<timestamp> (general media\n\n recorder)\n\n • /mnt/sdcard/google/db/mc/<timestamp> (general media\n\n recorder)\n\n • /mnt/sdcard/google/db/pr/<timestamp> (phone call\n\n recorder)\n\n • /mnt/sdcard/google/db/sr/<timestamp> (SMS-triggered\n\n audio recorder)\n\n • /mnt/sdcard/google/db/ps/<timestamp> (screenshot\n\n capture)\n\n • /mnt/sdcard/google/db1/<timestamp> (seen in older\n\n samples, no use of subfolders)\n\n Audio data can also be recorded to the following paths on\n\n external storage:\n\n • /<sdcard>/FinalAudio.amr\n\n •  /<sdcard>/RawAudio.raw\n\n • /<sdcard>/FinalAudio.wav\n\n[36 https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/HostnameVerifier.html](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n\n###### CarbonSteal attempts to perform rudimentary SSL certificate\n\n validation by using the HostnameVerifier[36] interface to confirm\n\n that the hostname of the C2 server communicating back to the\n\n malware is indeed the same one in the SSL certificate the SSL\n\n connection is using.\n\n CarbonSteal appears to have been the most active in 2017,\n\n when the vast majority of new samples were seen. However,\n\n later samples of CarbonSteal seen in 2019 moved towards\n\n making extensive use of Android accessibility services to\n\n exfiltrate messages from secure messaging applications, a\n\n trend commonly seen in other recent Android surveillance\n\n malware. This suggests that CarbonSteal is still under active\n\n development and continues to evolve.\n\n#### CarbonSteal C2 infrastructure and APT15 links\n\n###### During the investigation of CarbonSteal, the C2 domain\n\n amote-366.vicp[.]cc was found to be hosting numerous\n\n websites on a number of subdomains some of which\n\n contained content restricted in China. Site content included a\n\n GoogleDrive link to the book “Freedom in the Sunset” written\n\n by Professor Yuan Hongbing, which has been banned by\n\n Chinese authorities. Other content included Uyghur-themed\n\n political content and content that appears to be Iranian\n\n specific.\n\n Legitimate applications were also found hosted on the same\n\n site, such as versions of Baidu Netdisk for MacOSX, Android,\n\n iOS and Windows.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Examples of some of the hosted content on CarbonSteal’s C2 domain amote-366.vicp[.]cc.\n\n\n###### There could be a number of reasons a C2 server may be\n\n hosting this content. It is possible that the site originally\n\n hosted this content deliberately and was then compromised\n\n by the actor behind CarbonSteal. The alternative is that\n\n the actor may have used the same server with a secondary\n\n purpose of luring individuals who are inclined to access this\n\n content. In either case, this setup allows the actor to monitor\n\n access to this content and possibly target those that do.\n\n Non-compromised signer certificates used to sign\n\n CarbonSteal samples were also used to sign a subset of\n\n malware samples belonging to the families known as Henbox\n\n and DarthPusher. This consistent use of the same mobile\n\n\n###### surveillanceware families was also seen when examining\n\n SilkBean and DoubleAgent samples. This may suggest that\n\n actors behind the use of these malware families not only share\n\n the same target groups but also resources and tools.\n\n In March 2018, Lookout researchers discovered that\n\n certain CarbonSteal C2 domains overlapped with several\n\n HenBox samples found at the same time. A handful of these\n\n CarbonSteal samples were also found to communicate to a\n\n particular IP address (61.128.110[.]38) that overlapped with\n\n the deployment of an OSX backdoor XSLCmd reported by\n\n FireEye[37] in 2014.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### This article initially described the activity as belonging to the\n\n threat actor GREF, but it was updated in August 2019 to note\n\n that the activity is now being tracked as an uncategorized APT\n\n group. In past public reporting the actor known as GREF is\n\n also referred to as APT15, Ke3chang, Mirage, Vixen Panda and\n\n\n###### Playful Dragon. GREF is so named due to a variety of Google\n\n references in their activities, and the same can be seen in the\n\n activity of the threat actor behind CarbonSteal. This includes\n\n application titles, package names and encrypted files’ names.\n\n\n###### IoC overlap from 2018 between CarbonSteal, HenBox, and an IP address tied to APT backdoor use in 2014.\n\n\n###### In July 2019, ESET published findings on a previously undocumented backdoor named Okrum, used to deliver Ketrican\n\n malware[38] and attributed to the Ke3chang group. According to this report, several Ketrican samples from 2017\n\n communicated to subdomains of babytoy-online[.]com.\n\n\n###### Ketrican SHA-1 C2 server\n\n\n###### D3BFB10DB08C6828C3001C1F825ED6A6BF6F6E01 buy.babytoy-online[.]com\n\n 2C8B145EF5AC177C99DFCB8C0221E30B3A363A96 newflow.babytoy-online[.]com\n\n D8AA9E4918E464D00BA95A3E28B8707A148EC4D7 buy.babytoy-online[.]com\n\n\n###### F2BFDA51BDA3EE57878475817AF6E5F24FFBBB28 items.babytoy-online[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\n###### While not a concrete connection, this is reminiscent of the naming pattern seen in many past domains associated with Henbox,\n\n SilkBean and PluginPhantom infrastructure.\n\n\n###### Other domains seen associated with HenBox, SilkBean and PluginPhantom, families monitoring Chinese minorities.\n\n\n###### Given the overlaps of C2 infrastructure, it appears plausible\n\n that these three families have the same developer and targets.\n\n This belief, in conjunction with past public reporting[39] that\n\n HenBox is also tied to APT15, leads Lookout researchers to\n\n believe that SilkBean, PluginPhantom, and now CarbonSteal,\n\n can be tied to this mAPT threat.\n\n#### GoldenEagle\n\n###### Findings\n\n The last family in this discussion is GoldenEagle, which\n\n Lookout researchers also believe is being used by the\n\n same group of China-based actors described in this report.\n\n\n###### GoldenEagle, so called due to titles (“Golden.eagle”) and\n\n package names (“com.golden.eagle”) of samples believed to\n\n be test / development versions, targets primarily Uyghurs and\n\n Muslims in general, as well as Tibetans, individuals in Turkey,\n\n and in China. Golden eagles are used as part of ancient\n\n hunting traditions[40] throughout the Eurasian Steppe and\n\n diasporas in Mongolia and the Xinjiang Autonomous Region\n\n whose population is primarily Uyghur.\n\n Among the aspects that make GoldenEagle particularly\n\n interesting is that the earliest test samples of this family\n\n appeared as early as 2012, making it one of the longest\n running surveillanceware families we have observed to date.\n\n GoldenEagle code has been identified in an impressively\n\n\n[39 https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2020/03/vb2019-paper-pulling-pkplug-ad­](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n[versary-playbook-long-standing-espionage-activity-chinese-nation-state-adversary/](https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2020/03/vb2019-paper-pulling-pkplug-adversary-playbook-long-standing-espionage-activity-chinese-nation-state-adversary/)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### large and diverse set of applications over the years. These\n\n samples can be divided into two major groups: those that\n\n exfiltrate data via HTTP and those that exfiltrate data via SMTP,\n\n i.e., by sending exfiltrated data in file attachments of emails\n\n to an attacker-controlled mailbox using innocuous-looking\n\n subjects and mail body content. The latter technique, while\n\n appearing in the early stages of GoldenEagle development,\n\n has resurfaced in samples signed and analysed in May 2020.\n\n\n###### Insecure configurations in attacker infrastructure have also\n\n shown that the actor behind GoldenEagle is not only targeting\n\n Android devices, but also conducting phishing attacks in\n\n parallel from the same administration console. The actors\n\n behind GoldenEagle have shown themselves to be well\n\n resourced and capable of operating a long-running campaign.\n\n\n###### Mapping out when apps trojanized with GoldenEagle were signed shows the actors’ activity. A clear spike in samples belonging to this family\n\n took place during 2016, and new samples have continued to be observed in 2020. At this point it is unclear whether these new samples are\n\n part of testing or a re-emergence of GoldenEagle activity, as these newer samples appear to be largely unchanged and possess the test title\n\n “Golden.eagle”.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The majority of samples of GoldenEagle were clearly\n\n developed with targeting of the Uyghur minority in mind and\n\n included trojanized versions of apps such as Sarkuy (Uyghur\n\n music service), Tawarim (Uyghur e-commerce site), uyhurqa\n\n kirgvzvx (Uyghur input keyboard), Yeltapan Air (possibly\n\n an airline booking application - Yeltapan Inc. is a popular\n\n Uyghur app development company), TIBBIYJAWHAR (Uyghur\n\n Pharmaceutical app), Hawar.cn News (believed to previously\n\n provide Uyghur-specific news and content), Nur.cn News\n\n (also delivers Uyghur-specific content) and the Uyghur Quran,\n\n among others.\n\n Other samples included trojanized apps with a broad range\n\n of functionality from VPNs, instant messaging, and social\n\n\n###### networking to games, adult media content, and Google\n\n searching. Notable trojanized apps include Twitter, Facebook,\n\n Calendar, AIM, RenRen, VLC media player, and the QQ\n\n messaging application.\n\n The expanse of applications trojanized by GoldenEagle also\n\n indicated additional targets, with applications titled “快搜西藏”\n (Quick Search Tibet), “西藏同程游记” (Travel Notes in Tibet) and\n “美丽西藏精选壁纸” (Beautiful Tibet Featured Wallpaper) that\n\n appeared to focus on individuals living or travelling in Tibet.\n\n “Gundem News” was also seen in the array of titles suggesting\n\n individuals in Turkey are also targeted. “8684公交”, the Beijing\n\n bus transit application, was also seen as an app title, possibly\n\n indicating broader Chinese targeting.\n\n\n###### The actors behind GoldenEagle have deployed trojanized versions of a staggeringly large and diverse set of applications. This level of technical\n\n investment combined with the longevity of operations suggests that GoldenEagle is being managed by a well-resourced adversary. Shown\n\n above is a subset of app icons from the GoldenEagle family.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Malware details\n\n GoldenEagle samples can be divided into two disparate\n\n groups; samples that communicate to attackers through\n\n HTTP requests and samples that communicate via SMTP to a\n\n hardcoded email address that is assumed to be operated by\n\n the attacker.\n\n Early samples of GoldenEagle exfiltrated data through files\n\n sent over SMTP to an attacker-controlled email address.\n\n All samples had the same hardcoded attacker email \n . On start up these samples also\n\n sent an SMS message to an attacker-controlled number\n\n\n###### (18801206738, a Beijing mobile number) with the message “ A\n\n host online, attention please!”.\n\n Use of this version appears to have ended in 2017 and has only\n\n recently picked up again in May 2020 with samples labelled\n\n with the default name “Golden.eagle”. The email address\n\n and phone number remains consistent. This makes it unclear\n\n whether this is testing by the actor or another wave of activity.\n\n Data exfiltrated by these samples is limited to lightweight text\n\n files and includes the following content:\n\n\n###### Data type File attachment 00 Subject/body of email Content of text file\n\n\n###### Subject: Hello,George Call Logs C.txt Body: Forum Nokia Developer\n\n Subject: HELOS SMS SX.txt Body: MyBody\n\n\n###### <missed calls list> !-*RMC*-! <Incoming calls list> !-*RIC*-! <Outgoing calls list>\n\n <Inbox list> !-*ISG*-! <Outbox list> !-*OSG*-! <Drafts lits> !-*DSG*-! <Sentbox list>\n\n\n###### Subject: Hi,Peter Contacts P.txt <contact list> Body: Launches N900-Newest mobile\n\n\n###### Early versions of Golden Eagle exfiltrate data as an attachment to an email with subject, body, and attachment file name specific to the type of data being\n\n exfiltrated. Incomplete functionality for MMS message exfiltration as well as receiving emails from the attacker for command and control operations was\n\n also seen in later samples.\n\n\n###### The following credentials were used in all samples of the SMTP\n\n version of GoldenEagle:\n\n Smtp = “smtp.sina.cn”\n\n User = “ ”\n\n Password = [redacted]\n\n From = “ ”\n\n\n###### The second version of GoldenEagle vastly expands the\n\n malware’s capability and makes use of HTTP POST requests\n\n as its primary communication method with C2 infrastructure.\n\n These samples contain plaintext configuration files stored\n\n in the assets directory of each application from where C2\n\n information can be gathered.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### There are two versions of these configuration files that\n\n accompany slightly different functionality as well. The earlier\n\n version is labelled “goledn_config.json” that has only one\n\n configuration setting beyond attacker C2 details, which\n\n registers if the malware has been run for the first time or not.\n\n In samples making use of the second, more advanced version\n\n of the configuration file (named “ygoledn_config.json”) the\n\n configuration contains up to 15 different parameters and the\n\n malware includes functionality to update these parameters\n\n through C2 instructions, allowing an attacker to enable and\n\n disable various malicious functionality.\n\n These more recent GoldenEagle samples come with the\n\n surveillanceware capabilities listed below.\n\n • Get contact information.\n\n • Retrieve installed apps.\n\n • Retrieve call history.\n\n • Notify operator if it has root permissions.\n\n • Retrieve any doc, txt, gif, apk, jpg, png, mp3, and db files\n\n that are found on external storage.\n\n • Retrieve text messages.\n\n • Take screenshots.\n\n • Take photos with the device camera.\n\n • Request device administrator privileges.\n\n • Allow proxy configuration.\n\n • Record calls in .amr format.\n\n • Record environment audio when instructed by the\n\n operator.\n\n • Location tracking.\n\n • Get messages from chat applications such as WeChat.\n\n • Send notifications to specific SMS endpoints.\n\n • Update themselves.\n\n[41 http://izda.com/](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n\n###### SMS messages are sent by GoldenEagle when a second stage\n\n is successfully installed, or when a SMS message containing a\n\n Telegram code is received.\n\n GoldenEagle and CarbonSteal convergence\n\n Lookout researchers discovered several code overlaps\n\n between CarbonSteal and GoldenEagle, suggesting that the\n\n malware families are developed by the same actor.\n\n During our investigation, we noticed a unique WeChat\n\n ID (wx09fa07f77f651c23) in several CarbonSteal\n\n samples that was also found in one GoldenEagle\n\n sample. This ID is also used in an application (SHA-1:\n\n 30c34052ff4684b521e4a36038dd3d80a6693d20) that is\n\n signed using the same signing certificate also used to sign\n\n known CarbonSteal samples. However, this particular sample\n\n appears to be an app dropper rather than a full-featured\n\n surveillanceware though it is also capable of tracking device\n\n location. The title and legitimate functionality of the app is\n\n called “izda” and it connects to a Uyghur content site of the\n\n same name[41]. Lookout researchers were not able to retrieve a\n\n malicious second stage from the app.\n\n Code functionality not directly tied to malicious activity within\n\n the above-mentioned app dropper application was found\n\n to overlap with a number of other GoldenEagle samples all\n\n targeting Uyghur and Uzbek speaking individuals or groups.\n\n Their titles included, izda (Uyghur content site), Papap (a\n\n Chinese language vehicle information app associated with\n\n Autonavi), Baykuq (a Uyghur language news app), Misranim (a\n\n popular Uyghur language website), TIBBIYJAWHAR (Uyghur\n\n Pharmaceutical app), and Isimlar (an Uzbek child naming site,\n\n with a package name of com.yeltapan.isimlar).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Application icons of malware samples that share overlapping code found in CarbonSteal and GoldenEagle.\n\n\n###### All these titles are in line with past GoldenEagle and\n\n CarbonSteal targeting efforts, indicating that the two malware\n\n families have significant overlap in use. These new samples, in\n\n particular those with app dropper functionality may suggest\n\n the further evolution of this tooling and the continued activity\n\n of the actor behind these threats.\n\n C2 infrastructure and connections with other malware\n\n During this investigation we mapped out a sprawling\n\n infrastructure used by the actor behind GoldenEagle which\n\n resulted in over 50 domains and IP addresses being tied to\n\n this adversary. There was a consistent pattern of registering\n\n\n###### and using fake domains intended to fool users into believing\n\n that the domain names were associated with popular services\n\n such as Google, Norton, Symantec, and Voxer.\n\n At the time of writing this report, all known C2 infrastructure\n\n supporting GoldenEagle is no longer active. However,\n\n during the investigation in 2017-2018 we identified several\n\n domains which were found to contain security flaws, allowing\n\n for a deeper insight into adversary behavior, targeting and\n\n attribution. Among the content accessible was a management\n\n panel that contained email addresses of targets, what we\n\n believe to be GPS coordinates of target devices, IPs of\n\n admin logins and target devices, and evidence that phishing\n\n campaigns were being run from the same infrastructure.\n\n\n###### During the investigation in 2017 and 2018, Lookout researchers were able to retrieve the IP addresses for logins to the administrator panel since\n\n mid August of 2017. This included over 100 addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Target upload logs as seen on an open GoldenEagle administration panel showing some of the earliest uploads from infected devices in 2017.\n\n The logs shown in this figure are most likely test devices.\n\n Mapping out GPS coordinates listed in the management panel shows a close clustering centering around Tang chang’an Wall Site Park. One of\n\n these is located in an area labelled Xi’an Tianhe Defense Technology, which is a large defense contractor in China.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Screenshot showing one of the open GoldenEagle management panels where attacker-specified phishing links for Voxer, Facebook, VK, and\n\n Kik are listed. The translated table column titles from left to right are: “Number”, “Type”, “Phishing URL”, “Date”, “Action”. The button in the top\n\n left is labelled “Add Phishing URL”. ace.v0xer[.]net was seen live as late as August 2018 and resolved to an IP address to which a GoldenEagle C2\n\n server (www.vipapkdownload[.]com) also resolved until September 2019, suggesting GoldenEagle was used in multi-year campaigns and may\n\n have leveraged phishing attacks at the same time.\n\n\n###### A small number of GoldenEagle samples were also found\n\n to communicate to a C2 server known to be associated with\n\n DoubleAgent activity and tied to SilkBean infrastructure\n\n mentioned previously in this report (babyedu-online[.]\n\n com). Titles of these applications appear in English, Uyghur,\n\n Chinese, Arabic and Uzbek. One title “Abdulweli Qari” may\n\n refer to the prominent Uyghur Muslim cleric Abdukerim\n\n Abduweli, also known as, Kerem Qari, who was imprisoned in\n\n northwest Xinjiang[42].\n\n[42 https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/cleric-12142018153501.html](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n[43 https://blog.lookout.com/spywaller-mobile-threat](https://appsgeyser.io/3023577/UzbekChat)\n\n\n###### This follows the consistent pattern we have observed in IoCs\n\n within the four malware families discussed here of leveraging\n\n the names of prominent figures in the Uyghur community as\n\n email addresses in WHOIS information, and titles and content\n\n of malware samples, intended to entice individuals who are\n\n engaging in these topics.\n\n A handful of GoldenEagle samples also share a C2 IP address\n\n (203.124.14[.]109) with known samples of Spywaller[43] and\n\n titles of those samples were Uyghur targeted, yet another\n\n addition to the actor’s Android surveillance arsenal.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### About Lookout\n\n###### Lookout is the leader in mobile security, protecting the device\n\n at the intersection of the personal you and the professional\n\n you.
