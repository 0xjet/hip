Cybercriminals know this and readily\n\nuse it as lures, as we have seen in past spam runs that used fake YouTube links or promised\nphotos of naked celebrities.\n\nThis month, actors of Operation Arid Viper and members of the Yanbian Gang jumped on the\nsexually explicit content bandwagon, using them in separate attacks that target respective\nvictims in Israel and Kuwait, and South Korea.\n\n\n-----\n\nOperation Arid Viper attacked five Israeli-based organizations in the government, transport,\ninfrastructure, military, and academic industries, and one organization in Kuwait using spearphishing emails that dropped a pornographic video on a victim's computer.\n\n“It targeted professionals who might be receiving very inappropriate content at work and so\nwould hesitate to report the incident,” declares Trend Micro threat researchers in a recent\nreport of the Arid Viper discovery.\n\n**[Read:** **[How Operation Arid Viper Used Sexually Explicit Content]](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/operation-arid-viper-bypassing-the-iron-dome)**\n\nMeanwhile, fake versions of popular porn apps\n\nwere among the many lures that the Yanbian Gang used to infect millions of Android™\nmobile banking customers in South Korea.\n\nMobile banking customers unknowingly downloaded malware apps, which mobile threat\nresearcher Simon Huang described to come \"in the guise of popular porn apps with lewd\nicons and names and eye-catching descriptions like 'sexy women photos' and 'porn movies.'\n”\n\n\"They hardly ever deliver on their promise though when run. All they do, in fact, is steal and\nupload victims’ mobile banking credentials to C&C servers,\" adds Huang.\n\nWhen mobile users in South Korea download the apps—either through links sent via SMS or\nfrom infected mobile downloads—their mobile phone numbers, account names and number,\nand login credentials are automatically sent over to the Yanbian Gang members.\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Read:** **[Fake Porn Apps Used in South Korean Banking App Scam]](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/south-korean-fake-banking-app-scam)**\n\n**Battling Malicious Clicks and Urges**\n\nThreat actors rely on an element of shame from professionals who received the\npornographic video, care of Operation Arid Viper, to keep them from reporting the incident to\ntheir IT departments. This gives attackers a longer window to use the malware to get\nwhatever information they can from the system. \"These victims’ failure to act on the threat\ncould have then allowed the main malware to remain undiscovered. The attackers used a\ndistinct and likely successful strategy previously unseen when it came to avoiding incident\nresponse team investigations,\" researchers stressed in the paper.\n\nMost targeted attack strategies leave employees out of incident response solutions.\nHowever, given that the human component is a typical weak spot in a system's defenses,\ndoing so is an oversight that can lead to data loss or theft.\n\nWe have previously noted that organizations need to complement security efforts with a\nproactive security awareness program. This program should train the workforce to practice\nsafe habits and how to react to actual security incidents.\n\n**[[Read:How Employees Make or Break Enterprise Security]](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/employees-make-or-break-enterprise-security)**\n\nIn addition, everyone should be reminded that sexually explicit content is a mainstay in a\ncybercriminal's bag of targeted attack tricks. It is not just organizations that are in danger of\nthese schemes, as we have seen in the case of the South Korean mobile banking app\nscheme.\n\nConsumers and enterprises alike should establish proactive measures against targeted\nattacks, which should also address malware and flaws in mobile devices.\n\n**[Read:** **[Are You Guilty of Poor Mobile Security?]](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/mobile-safety/are-you-guilty-of-poor-mobile-security)**\n\n**[Read:** **[Proven Protection Against Targeted Attacks and Advanced Threats]](https://www.trendmicro.com.ph/cloud-content/us/pdfs/business/white-papers/wp_custom-defense-against-targeted-attacks.pdf)**\n\nHIDE\n\n**Like it?
