Damage could have been done to those systems if Israeli authorities hadn’t\nfoiled the attack, Unna claimed.\n\n“We’re now in the middle of preparing for the next phase [of attacks] to come — because it\nwill come eventually,” he said in a speech streamed at the CybertechLive Asia conference.\n\n\n-----\n\nPublic details on the attack are scarce, as Israeli officials have not released forensic data in\n[connection with the incident. The Israeli cyber directorate issued a terse statement in late](https://www.gov.il/he/departments/publications/reports/scadaalert)\nApril about attempted breaches of water pumping stations and treatment plants, and urged\ncompanies in the sector to take defensive measures.\n\nMultiple media reports blamed Iran for the malicious activity. (CyberScoop could not\nindependently confirm this attribution.) The Iranian government has denied involvement.\n\nUnna acknowledged the suggestions, but did not specifically blame Iran.\n\n“We are not attributing or saying anything officially about who’s behind it,” he said. “But it’s\nnot a gang, it’s not a cybercrime group. They gain nothing from it.”\n\nIn retaliation, Israeli hackers breached computers at an Iranian shipping port in early\nMay, [according to a Washington Post report.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/officials-israel-linked-to-a-disruptive-cyberattack-on-iranian-port-facility/2020/05/18/9d1da866-9942-11ea-89fd-28fb313d1886_story.html)\n\nAfter mentioning that report, Unna suggested that Israel may have hit back at Iran for the\ncyberattack. “Maybe and maybe not,” he said. “It seems like there are new rules of\nengagement, rules of war” in cyberspace.\n\n[Galina Antova, co-founder of industrial cybersecurity company Claroty, said the](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/claroty/)\nattempted cyberattack on Israeli water systems “highlights that while water infrastructure\ntypically eludes the public’s attention as a major source of cyber risk, it remains susceptible\nto both targeted and non-targeted threats.”\n\n[Israel and](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/israel/) [Iran — two bitter enemies — have long conducted cyber-operations against each](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/iran/)\nother as part of a broader regional conflict. More than a decade ago, suspected U.S. and\n[Israeli intelligence operatives used the Stuxnet computer worm to sabotage centrifuges at an](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/stuxnet/)\nIranian nuclear facility.\n\nThe [coronavirus pandemic has reaffirmed that hackers are unwilling to refrain from attacking](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/coronavirus/)\ncritical infrastructure, Unna said.\n\n[Red lines will continue to be crossed, he said, referring to recent cyberattacks on the Czech](https://www.cyberscoop.com/czech-hospital-cyberattack-coronavirus/)\nhealth care sector. “Cyber winter is coming and coming faster than even I suspected.”\n\n\n-----",
