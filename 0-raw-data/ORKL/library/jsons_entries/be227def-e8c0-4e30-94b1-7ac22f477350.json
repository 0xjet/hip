Collectively they all\nspent millions on a popular non-fungible token\n(NFT) called the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).\n\nDepending on how they store their NFTs, they\ncould also become high-profile targets for\ncybercrime. Already, in December 2021, a BAYC\ncollector lost $2.2 million after his BAYC and\nMutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs were stolen by a\nhacker.\n\nThis was not an isolated incident. With the\nNFT market booming (NFT trading volume\nincreased by over 20,000% from 2020 to 2021),\ncybercriminals have rushed to adapt their\nstrategies to exploit this still relatively new trend.\nFrom imitating social media accounts for NFT\ncreators to making fake Google ads, hackers are\nexploring all avenues to make away with people’s\ncryptos and NFTs.\n\nHowever, one emerging threat vector for crypto\ncrimes that the Morphisec Research Team\nhas noticed and that is particularly worrying is\nhappening through the Discord app. Last year, we\n\n\n**_Source: OpenSea a popular crypto wallet site_**\n\nanalyzed the BABADEDA Crypter, a crypter that\nspecifically targets crypto and NFT communities\nthrough malicious Discord bots. Not only have\nthe attackers behind this campaign evolved their\nattack methods since then (using other crypters\nbesides the BABADEDA), but we have also\nrecently noticed an increasing number of stopped\nattacks on Morphisec’s customers’ devices which\noriginated from this particular NFT campaign.\n\nIn this report, we pick up where we left off in\nNovember 2021, taking a closer look at the\nattacker’s motivations, infrastructure, and\nactivities. We also explain why Next-Generation\nAnti-Virus (NGAV) and Endpoint Detection and\nResponse (EDR) solutions are not able to protect\nagainst these types of campaigns and how\nMoving Target Defense technology can keep your\ndevices safe from this dangerous threat.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Wait… WHAT is an NFT???\n\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital files\nthat, like cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or\nEthereum, exist on a blockchain, a form of digital\nledger. NFTs can be any type of digital object,\nfrom artwork and memes to tweets and audio. In\nsome instances, NFTs may also be tied to physical\nobjects.\n\nEach NFT has a digital signature that acts as proof\nof ownership. However, unlike cryptocurrencies,\nNFTs are non-fungible, meaning that they can’t\n\n\nbe equally exchanged for something else, nor\ncan they be reproduced. In this way, NFTs can be\nlikened to limited edition Baseball cards or rare\nminted coins, where rarity/scarcity equals value.\n\nCompounded by increased interest in\ncryptocurrency (the underlying foundation to\ncreating and tracking NFTs), this has caused a\n125% increase in NFT growth, and everyone is\njumping in to grab a piece of the pie.\n\n\n**_Source: Cloud Security Alliance SECtember, 2021 via The Demo Forum_**\n\n\n-----\n\n# An Expanding Metaverse\n\nPart of what is propelling the growth\nof NFT adoption is the promise of the\nmetaverse. The metaverse will be an\nonline, three-dimensional universe\nthat combines multiple virtual spaces.\nAlthough it doesn’t yet exist, many\nsee it as a future version of the\ninternet. Accessing these 3D spaces\nvia smartglasses, mobile apps, gaming\nconsoles, and other metaverse-friendly\ndevices, users, represented as 3D\navatars, will be able to collaborate, shop,\nplay games, and socialize, much in the\nsame way they do already in the real\nworld.\n\n\n**_Source: Nike_**\n\n\nAs an immersive virtual economy, the metaverse will rely on cryptocurrencies as a mode of payment,\nwith each metaverse likely to have its own set of coins. Users will be able to use these coins to pay for\ngoods and services within the metaverse, including NFTs, virtual real estate, shoes, and more. Walmart,\nAdidas, Gucci, and other popular brands have already invested millions as they make a giant leap into\nthe realm of virtual goods.\n\n### More Money, More Problems\nOne unforeseen consequence of the\ngrowing interest in cryptocurrencies,\nNFTs, and the metaverse is the rising\nnumber of scams. Considering that the\nNFT market is worth $7 billion and that\nstealing NFTs can net malicious actors\nmillions of dollars overnight, this is not\nsurprising.\n\n\n**_Source: YouTube - #Metaverse | Walmart VR Virtual Shopping_**\n\nExperience SXSW\n\n\nAs users and businesses continue to\nembrace this new form of e-commerce,\ncriminals are finding new ways to\nexploit them. We cover this trend in\ndetail in the next section.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Early Warnings - Findings from the Morphisec Research Team\n\n\nNot long ago, the Morphisec Research Team\ninvestigated an NFT and crypto crime campaign\nknown as the BABADEDA Crypter, which we\ndiscovered during a new crypter research study.\nDuring our investigation, we focused on the\ncrypter’s mechanism and capabilities while also\nbriefly discussing a new campaign targeting the\ncrypto and NFT communities.\n\n\nThe recent surge in NFT scams and crypto crime\nactivities, as well as a rising number of attacks\non our customers’ devices (fully prevented by\nMorphisec) linked to this NFT campaign, has\nprompted us to dive deeper into the attacker’s\ninfrastructure and dissect its activity.\nIn this report, we will walk you through the\nprogression of the attacker’s infrastructure\nand capabilities since November 2020, the first\nevidence of its activity, until today.\n\n\n### Infection Strategy\nBefore moving forward, we need to understand the attacker’s workflow, starting with who their target\nvictims are, up until the point they steal their funds.\n\nIn this campaign, we identified that the attacker’s targets are Crypto and NFT communities (as per our\nprevious investigation). We know that the actor impersonates existing Crypto/NFT services with a Discord\nchannel. Thus, their victims are members of such communities.\n\nHere is an example of a real scam conducted on a popular Discord forum on February 7, 2022.\n\n**_Source: Discord_**\n\n\n-----\n\nHere is another example.\n\n**_Source: Discord_**\n\n# Can You Spot a Fake?\n\nTake the example below. Two of the\nthree NFTs are fakes. Can you tell\nwhich ones?\n\nThe leftmost NFT is sold by an artist\nwith a stolen profile picture. We\nknow this NFT is a scam because\nit doesn’t have a yellow verification\ncheck mark in the upper left-hand\ncorner.\n\n\n**_Source: Benzinga_**\n\nThe NFT in the middle is also a fake.\nHowever, it is obvious that it was\ncreated by a more sophisticated criminal because they were able to fake the verification check mark.\nNevertheless, if you zoom in, you can tell the difference between this verification check mark and a real\ncheck mark (the NFT on the right, with the verification check mark extending outside the avatar).\n\nThe sophistication of these types of scams, along with the attacks that follow, is increasing every day.\n\n\n-----\n\n# You’ve Been Scammed, Now What?\n\nBy looking at the full attack chain, we can infer that the actor wants to steal high-value NFTs and\ncryptocurrencies. Their motives explain why they chose the kind of malware delivery method they did.\n\n_Full attack chain [Source: Morphisec]_\n\nThe attack chain comprises several components, and each one can be used as a standalone or as a\nservice. This means that the actor stealing funds from a particular victim is not necessarily the developer\nof these components. The fact that the components are independent gives the attacker the ability to\nimprove or change tactics quickly.\n\n**We will cover the following components in the following sections:**\n\n\n\n- The attacker creates Discord bots that, to\nthe uninitiated eye, may look like they are\nowned by one of the official community\nadministrators.\n\n- The bots send private messages to channel\nmembers inviting them to download the new\ndesktop application from an official-looking\nwebsite that is actually owned by the attacker.\n\n- The website is a perfect copy of the real site\nwith one major change - a download button\nto the fake desktop application.\n\n- Even when the application is downloaded and\nexecuted, victims still have no idea something\n\n\nis wrong. Under the hood, however, the\nmalware unpacks itself and loads the final\npayload.\n\n- The final payload, usually RAT, is used\nto steal the victim’s browsing data and\ninstall keylogger and other surveillance\nfunctionalities, including ones that give the\nattacker complete control over the victim’s\nmachine.\n\n- The attacker can use the stolen data to take\nover the victim’s identity and transfer their\npossessions to their own wallet/account.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious bots facilitate over 90% of NFT scams. These bots can be easily obtained through Discord\nforums, Twitter, and underground exchange communities on the dark web. They are easy to operate\nand are very lucrative. A motivated bot operator can purchase a program for 0.2 Ethereum ($600 at the\ntime of this writing) and get a 15x+ return in only one week. This return compounds as experience and\nefficiencies are gained.\n\n### Evolution of the Threat Actor\n\n_Campaign Timeline_\n\nAlthough an attack chain has many components, when looking at the evolution of the campaign, two\nmain components jumped out:\n\n1. Improved architecture (both decoy servers and file servers)\n2. The final payload used once successful infection is achieved.\n\nIn this section, we’ll explain each component and its progression over time:\n\n   - Infrastructure - the DevOps and networking infrastructures required from start to finish.\n\n   - Execution Methods - which Crypter is being used to deliver the final payload.\n\n   - Final Payloads - what final payload the actor used.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Infrastructure Discord Bots\nThe actor uses Discord bots to reach their victims. They do so by sending official-looking DMs in targeted\nDiscord channels:\n\n_Discord private message luring a user to download a malicious app_\n\nTo do this, the actor creates dozens of Discord bots that automatically send these messages to potential\nvictims. However, spamming a forum with bots raises suspicions immediately.\n\n_Bots accounts discovered by a user_\n\n\n-----\n\nPreviously, finding and blocking the spamming bots was relatively easy - as shown on the previous page leading the actor to use better naming conventions.\n\n_Different names to the bots_\n\nThe latest campaign shows the actor using different content within these messages and randomized yet\nstill valid looking usernames. This suggests that the actor actively improves their phishing capabilities and\ndevelops their infection method over time.\n\n_Source: Kasada_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Decoy Sites\nThe main purpose of these fraudulent Discord messages is to lure the victim into downloading the “new\nofficial desktop application” from the “official site.” Keeping its real intentions hidden, the attacker creates\nan identical copy of the home page. The only thing they change is the CTA button.\n\n_Decoy vs. Original Site_\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough the technique for creating decoy sites hasn’t changed, the targeted apps did. The attacker\nchanges the active decoys according to the community it’s currently targeting.\n\nThe figure below illustrates the changes the attacker made between December 2021 to February 2022.\n\n**December** **January** **February**\n```\n   spookyswap[.]fund orca[.]mba pegaxy[.]fund\n\n```\n`popsicle[.]fund` xyfinance[.]fund `torix[.]fund`\n```\n    snowbank[.]fund osmosiszone[.]fund jonesdao[.]net\n   alchemists[.]fund grim[.]fund cocosbcx[.]fund\n   abracadabra[.]run polychainsmonsters[.]com gitcoin[.]fund\n     zapp3r[.]com viper[.]fund sushi-v3[.]app\n   olympus-dao[.]fund woofsolana[.]fund meritcircle[.]fund\n     debank[.]fund steps[.]fund biconomy[.]fund\n  polygon-project[.]com strongblock[.]fund oxdao[.]net\n\n```\nring-finance[.]com `blocto-portto[.]fund` vvsfinance[.]fund\n```\n   terra-money[.]com thor[.]fund\n\n```\nIt is not clear why the attacker changes the targeted applications and communities. However, we\ncan assume they do so when their scam is revealed or when they are trying to find a better attacking\nlandscape in new and unaware communities.\n\n### File Servers\nThe third step of the\ninfection is responsible for\ndelivering the executable\nto the victim. During our\nresearch period, we tracked\narchitectural changes in\nthis mechanism. It looks like\nthe attacker tested several\napproaches, and now they\nconverge these into their\nfinal version.\n\n_Fake application delivery methods_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Version 1: The attacker hosted the fake application inside its respective decoy site. For example,**\n```\nterra-money[.]net served the file Terra_Station_Setup_1.2.1.exe when making a request to\nterra-money[.]net/station/Terra_Station_Setup_1.2.1.exe route.\n\n```\n**Version 2: Cybersquatting. Decoy site A redirects the traffic to decoy site B that holds its malware.**\nFor example, safemoone[.]net is a decoy site to the original safemoon.net redirected by\n```\nlarvaslab[.]com to download the fake application from safemoone[.]us/download/\nLarvaLabs-App_v2.1.1-setup.exe route.\n\n```\n**Version 3: All decoys download from the same centralized file server. As of writing this report, the file**\nservers used in this campaign are:\n\n**Date Down** **Domain** **IP**\n```\n  17/12/2021 - 10/01/2022 veeffriends[.]com 46.30.40[.]105\n   12/01/2022 - Active download-app-v2[.]fund 46.30.40[.]108\n   01/02/2022 - Active server-storage-dwl[.]com 46.30.44[.]84\n\n```\nThere’s a clear shift between the methods used. In the beginning, the actor used the simplest working\nsolution. We assume that the second method is a transition step to the third method - we saw a large\nnumber of decoy sites downloading from only two other decoy sites. Observing the third method, we\ncan see that the attacker has evolved to use the “right” way from a distributed application’s architecture\n\n_Fake application delivery methods_\n\n\n-----\n\npoint of view.\nAlthough the third method allows greater flexibility for the attacker to update their malware due to a\ncentralized repository, the problem with this method is that it opens one point of failure - once the\ncurrently active file server is down, the attack chain breaks.\n\n### Hosting Services\nThe actor uses EuroByte’s services as its preferred hosting service to deliver their fake applications. We\nhave found references of other cybercriminals using EuroByte’s services to host DCRat botnet controller\n(asos[.]click), Emotet (azatop[.]ru, korechok[.]ru, …), AutoKMS (kmsmatrix[.]info), etc.\n\n**Domain** **IP** **Decoy Site?** **Country** **Hosting Service**\n```\n  spiritswaps[.]com 46.30.40[.]105 Yes Russia EuroByte.ru\n splinterslands[.]com 46.30.40[.]105 Yes Russia EuroByte.ru\n   safemoone[.]us 46.30.40[.]105 Yes Russia EuroByte.ru\n babydogescoin[.]com 46.30.40[.]105 Yes Russia EuroByte.ru\n  veeffriends[.]com 46.30.40[.]105 No Russia EuroByte.ru\ndownload-app-v2[.]fund 46.30.40[.]108 No Russia EuroByte.ru\n server-storage-dwl[.]com 46.30.40[.]84 No Russa EuroByte.ru\n\n### Files Delivered\n```\nThe downloaded files have a similar naming convention, size, and icon as their legitimate counterparts.\nThe naming convention and the icon help fool the victim into believing it’s a legitimate application. On\nthe other hand, a similar size may help evade scanning engines.\n\n|Domain|File Name|Size|Icon|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|grim[.]fund|GrimFinance-dApp-v2.3.1.exe|118MB||\n|metaverses-pro[.]com|MetaversePro-App-v2.0.exe|122MB||\n|debank[.]fund|DeBank-dApp-v2.2-release.exe|122MB||\n|helium-app[.]com|Helium-App-v2.2-release.exe|116MB||\n|moonebeam[.]com|MoonbeamApp-v2.1.0_release.exe|108MB||\n\n\n-----\n\n### Execution Methods\nAfter mapping the infrastructure used throughout the campaign, we dug into the actor’s execution\nmethods. This campaign was first revealed when our team researched a new crypter used in the wild,\nbut that’s not the only crypter used.\n\nAt the beginning of the campaign (see the table below), we saw evidence of the actor using custom .NET\nCrypters and Crypto Obfuscator. However, starting from August 2021, it looks like the actor has moved\nto use BABADEDA Crypter as their main crypter of choice.\n\nAlthough we don’t think this threat actor is the developer behind BABADEDA Crypter, we found that they\nare the first to use the latest variants. This may suggest that this threat actor purchased a private stub or\nthat there is a close relationship between the two.\n\nBy now, we know who the victims are, and we are also aware of the attacker’s goal. What’s left is\nunderstanding how the goal was achieved. To answer this question, we traced the final payload from the\nbeginning of the campaign to the end. This resulted in three different RATs used as the final payload Remcos, BitRAT, and AsyncRAT.\n\nThis can be seen in the following table:\n\n**Date** **Packer/Crypter** **Payload** **C2** **Port**\n```\n 11/2020 - 07/2021 Custom .NET packer Remcos 95.217.114[.]96 4782\n                                  37.48.89[.]8 4783\n                                 94.23.218[.]87\n 07/2021 - 08/2021 Crypto Obfuscator Remcos 135.181.17[.]47 4783\n               (.NET)\n 08/2021 - 10/2021 BABADEDA BitRAT 135.181.140[.]182 7777\n                                135.181.140[.]153\n                                 135.181.6[.]215\n 11/2021 - 12/2021 BABADEDA using DLL Remcos 65.21.127[.]164 4783\n            sideloading with AsyncRAT 4449\n              IIS Express\n 12/2021 - *Active BABADEDA using DLL Remcos 193.56.29[.]242 4783\n            sideloading with\n             Adobe/TopoEdit\n 01/2022 - *Active BABADEDA using DLL Remcos 157.90.1.54 4783\n            sideloading with\n               Link.exe\n\n```\n*Active - At the time of writing\n\n|Date|Packer/Crypter|Payload|C2|Port|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|11/2020 - 07/2021|Custom .NET packer|Remcos|95.217.114[.]96 37.48.89[.]8 94.23.218[.]87|4782 4783|\n|07/2021 - 08/2021|Crypto Obfuscator (.NET)|Remcos|135.181.17[.]47|4783|\n|08/2021 - 10/2021|BABADEDA|BitRAT|135.181.140[.]182 135.181.140[.]153 135.181.6[.]215|7777|\n|11/2021 - 12/2021|BABADEDA using DLL sideloading with IIS Express|Remcos AsyncRAT|65.21.127[.]164|4783 4449|\n|12/2021 - *Active|BABADEDA using DLL sideloading with Adobe/TopoEdit|Remcos|193.56.29[.]242|4783|\n|01/2022 - *Active|BABADEDA using DLL sideloading with Link.exe|Remcos|157.90.1.54|4783|\n\n\n-----\n\n# Technical Details\n\nOne of the more recent features added to the attack chain is the usage of a DLL sideloading attack to\ninject the final payload into a benign application. In our previous research, we explained in detail the\ninner workings of the BABADEDA Crypter. During our current investigation, we observed that all fake\napplications utilize a DLL Side-Loading technique on trusted applications such as iisexpress.exe (IIS\nExpress), A3DUtility.exe (Adobe Acrobat Reader), and TopoEdit.exe (Microsoft tool)\n\n_DLL Side-Loading_\n\nThe additional layer allows attackers to run the BABADEDA Crypter under a legitimate process instead of\na fake one, as done previously. As shown in the figure above, a new DLL is loaded into the process.\n\nFirst, the fake application’s installer will unpack the files to the destination directory. Then it launches\nthe benign executable, for example, A3DUtility.exe. Inside the executable’s import table, we will\nfind BIB.dll import. This is a modified version of the original BIB.dll, used for sideloading the first\nstage of the malicious payload. This version of BIB.dll isn’t signed and has another entry in its IAT - an\nimport of AcroInfo.dll.\n\n_IAT comparison_\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough the name may trick you into thinking this file is part of a benign Adobe Reader installation, in\nreality, this DLL loads the BABADEDA Crypter we covered in our previous research.\n\n_Loading BABADEDA Crypter’s DLL_\n\nBABADEDA Crypter already had a low detection rate in VT, and the new variant helps keep it totally FUD\nfor multiple scans, as seen below.\n\n_Totally FUD Remcos payload taking with its C2_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Options to Prevention and Response Gaining Insights\nHacked credentials and crypto accounts are among the most sought-after and valuable items for\npurchase on the dark web and underground communities. Due to the skyrocketing prices of BTC, ETH,\nand other cryptocurrencies, hacked accounts may hold large sums of coin-based currency and cash,\nprotected by relaxed security measures after the initial verification process. This can then be cashed in\nfor NFTs and other high-value goods in the metaverse and the physical world.\n\n**Crypto** **$ Average Price**\n\n**(USD) 2021**\n\nHacked Coinbase verified account $610\n\nUSA verified LocalBitcoins account $350\n\nCypto.com verified account $300\n\nCoinfield.com verified account $410\n\nKraken verified account $810\n\nCex.io verified account $710\n\nBlockchain.com verified account $310\n\nBinance verified account $410\n\nExample listings of hacked cyptocurrency site accounts being sold.\n\n**_Source: Privacy Affairs Dark Web Price Index_**\n\nMorphisec Insights, as well as Morphisec Threat Intelligence, can act as an early warning system for\nyour enterprise to give you visibility into criminals that are targeting your employees and organization.\nCredential theft and account takeover is a common entry point for criminals to establish a foothold into\nyour organization and move laterally, further enforcing more damage to business operations and critical\nassets. The industry best practice is to monitor the areas where criminals operate to mitigate attacks\nbefore they occur.\n\n### Moving Target Defense\nAs a prevention-focused solution, Morphisec Guard morphs device memory to confuse and trap\nattacks that avoid NGAV solutions. As a result, defenders can automatically protect assets like NFTs and\ncryptocurrencies against zero-day threats like the crypters discussed in this report.\n\n\n-----\n\n### When All Else Fails\nIn many cases, we have found that it is already too late to prevent this type of attack from occurring,\nand incident response (IR) is needed. Morphisec Incident Response team works collaboratively with\nclient organizations to triage critical security incidents and conduct forensic analysis to solve immediate\ncyberattacks, as well as provide recommendations for reducing your organization’s risk exposure.\n\n**The Morphisec IR team will leverage this insight to:**\n\n   - Help contain in-progress incidents and reduce damage.\n\n   - Provide recommendations for long-term risk reduction.\n\n   - Audit critical infrastructure to ensure you have the lowest possible risk of exposure to a\ncyberattack.\n\nContact the Morphisec IR Team\n\n# Conclusion\n\n\nAs demonstrated above, these highly dangerous\ncrypters can have a devastating effect. Targeting\ncryptocurrency users through trusted attack\nvectors gives its distributors a fast-growing\nselection of potential victims. Because crypters\ncan masquerade as known applications with\ncomplex obfuscation techniques, anyone\nrelying on traditional signature-based malware\ndetection has no way of knowing if a crypter is on\ntheir machine and can’t stop it from executing.\nMachine learning and behavior-based endpoint\nprotection platforms (EPP) or endpoint detection\n\n\nand response (EDR) solutions may also have a\ndifficult time detecting this type of attack, as they\nare not as effective against in-memory attacks.\n\nMitigating the threat posed by a crypter\nrequires securing the device memory it targets.\nMorphisec does this through Moving Target\nDefense (MTD), a technology that creates a\ndynamic attack surface and morphs process\nmemory to trap crypters like BABADEDA before\nthey are able to deploy.\n\n\n-----\n\n# IOCs\n\nMore IOCs can be found in our previous blog.\n\n### Decoy Websites\n\n\n###
