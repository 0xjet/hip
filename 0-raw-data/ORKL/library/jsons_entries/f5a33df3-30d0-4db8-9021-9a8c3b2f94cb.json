We code\n\nnamed the vulnerability as “double kill” exploit. This vulnerability affects the\n\nlatest version of Internet Explorer and applications that use the IE kernel. When\n\nusers browse the web or open Office documents, they are likely to be potential\n\ntargets. Eventually the hackers will implant backdoor Trojan to completely\n\ncontrol the computer. In response, we shared with Microsoft the relevant\n\ndetails of the 0day vulnerability in a timely manner. This APT attack was\n\nanalyzed and attributed upon the detection and we now confirmed its\n\nassociation with the APT-C-06 Group.\n\nOn April 18, 2018, as soon as 360 Core Security detected the malicious activity,\n\nwe contacted Microsoft without any delay and submitted relevant details to\n\nMicrosoft. Microsoft confirmed this vulnerability on the morning of April 20th\n\nand released an official security patch on May 8th. Microsoft has fixed the\n\nvulnerability and named it CVE-2018-8174. After the vulnerability was properly\n\nresolved, we published this report on May 9th, along with further technical\n\ndisclosure of the attack and the 0day.\n\n## II A�ection in China\n\nAccording to the sample data analysis, the attack affected regions in China are\n\n\nattack from Win32k TypeIsolation\n\nSave and Reborn GDI data-only\n\nattack from Win32k TypeIsolation\n\n\n#### 分类目录\n\n[APT报告 (2)](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/category/apt%e6%8a%a5%e5%91%8a/)\n\n[web前端技术 (4)](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/category/web%e5%89%8d%e7%ab%af%e6%8a%80%e6%9c%af/)\n\n[人工智能 (2)](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/category/%e4%ba%ba%e5%b7%a5%e6%99%ba%e8%83%bd/)\n\n[其他 (4)](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/category/%e5%85%b6%e4%bb%96/)\n\n[内核技术 (9)](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/category/kernel/)\n\n[勒索软件 (9)](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/category/%e5%8b%92%e7%b4%a2%e8%bd%af%e4%bb%b6/)\n\n[后台技术 (7)](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/category/%e5%90%8e%e5%8f%b0%e6%8a%80%e6%9c%af/)\n\n[威胁预警 (5)](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/category/%e5%a8%81%e8%83%81%e9%a2%84%e8%ad%a6/)\n\n[客户端技术 (1)](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/category/%e5%ae%a2%e6%88%b7%e7%ab%af%e6%8a%80%e6%9c%af/)\n\n[年度报告 (1)](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/category/%e5%b9%b4%e5%ba%a6%e6%8a%a5%e5%91%8a/)\n\n[技术分享 (2)](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/category/tech/)\n\n[服务端测试 (2)](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/category/%e6%9c%8d%e5%8a%a1%e7%ab%af%e6%b5%8b%e8%af%95/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## III Attack Procedure Analysis\n\nThe lure documents captured in this attack are in Hebrew[1] The attackers\n\nexploit office with OLE autolink objects (CVE-2017-0199) to embed the\n\ndocuments onto malicious websites.

UAC bypass was used in this process, as well as file steganography\n\nand memory reflection uploading, in order to bypass traffic detection and to\n\ncomplete loading without any files.\n\nThe main process of the attack is shown in the following figure:\n\n\n-----\n\nOn April 18, 2018, Advanced Threat Response Team of 360 Core Security\n\nDivision detected a high-risk 0day vulnerabilities. The vulnerability affects the\n\nlatest version of Internet Explorer and applications that use the IE kernel and\n\nhas been found to be used for targeted APT attacks. On the same day, 360\n\nimmediately communicated with Microsoft and submitted details of the\n\nvulnerability to Microsoft. Microsoft confirmed this vulnerability on the morning\n\nof April 20th and released an official security patch on May 8th. The 0day\n\nvulnerability was fixed and it was named CVE-2018-8174.\n\nCVE-2018-8174 is a remote code execution vulnerability of Windows VBScript\n\nengine. Attackers can embed malicious VBScript to Office document or website\n\nand then obtain the credential of the current user, whenever the user clicks, to\n\nexecute arbitrary code.\n\n### 2. Vulnerability Principles\n\nTh h h i i l l i f h l bili l f d h\n\n\n-----\n\nSeeing from the POC created by using the exploit samples we captured, the\n\nprinciples of the exploit is obvious. The POC samples are as below:\n\nDetailed procedures:\n\n1) First create a cla1 instance assigned to b, and then assign value 0 to b,\n\nbecause at this point b’s referenced count is 1, causing cla1’s Class_Terminate\n\nfunction to be called.\n\n2) In the Class_Terminate function, again assign b to c and assign 0 to b to\n\nbalance the reference count.\n\n3) After the Class_Terminate return, the memory pointed to by the b object will\n\nbe released, so that a pointer to the memory data of the released object b is\n\n\n-----\n\n### 3. Exploitation\n\nThe 0-day exploit exploits UAF multiple times to accomplish type confusion. It\n\nfakes and overrides the array object to perform arbitrary address reading and\n\nwriting. In the end, it releases code to execute after constructing an object.\n\nCode execution does not use the traditional ROP or GodMod, but through the\n\nscript layout Shellcode to stabilize the use.\n\n#### Fake array to perform arbitrary address reading and writing\n\nMem members of 2 classes created by UAF are offset by 0x0c bytes, and an\n\narray of 0x7fffffff size is forged by reading and writing operation to the two\n\nmem members.\n\ntypedef struct tagSAFEARRAY {\n\nUSHORT cDims; // cDims = 0001\n\nUSHORT fFeatures; fFeatures =0x0880\n\nULONG cbElements; // the byte occupied by one element (1 byte)\n\nULONG cLocks;\n\nPVOID pvData; // Buffer of data starts from 0x0\n\nSAFEARRAYBOUND rgsabound[1];\n\n\n-----\n\nULONG cElements; // the number of elements (0x7fffffff, user space)\n\nLONG lLbound; // the initial value of the index (starting from 0)\n\n} SAFEARRAYBOUND, *LPSAFEARRAYBOUND;\n\nA forged array composes of a one-dimensional array, the number of elements\n\nis 7fffffff, each element occupies 1 byte, and the element memory address is 0.\n\nSo the accessible memory space for the array is from 0x00000000 to\n\n0x7ffffffff*1. Therefore, the array can be read and written at any address. But\n\nthe storage type of lIlIIl is string, so only by modifying the data type to 0x200C,\n\ni.e. VT_VARIANT|VT_ARRAY( array type), attackers can achieve their purpose.\n\n#### Read the storage data of the speci�ed parameter\n\nIn the malicious code, the above function is mainly used to read the data of the\n\nmemory address specified by the parameter. The idea is to obtain the specified\n\nmemory read capability via the characteristics of the first 4 bytes of the string\n\naddress (namely, the content of the bstr, type, size field) returned by the lenb\n\n(bstr xx) in the vb (the data type in the VBS is bstr).\n\n\n-----\n\nfirst add 4 to the value to get 0x11223348, and then set the variant type to 8\n\n(string type). Next, call len function: if found to be BSTR type, vbscript will\n\nassume that the forward 4 bytes (0x11223344) is the address memory to store\n\nthe length. So the len function will be executed and the value of the specified\n\nmemory address will be returned.\n\n#### Obtain Key DLL Base Address\n\n1. The attacker leaks the virtual function table address of the\n\nCScriptEntryPoint object in the following way, which belongs to\n\nVbscript.dll.\n\n1. Obtain the vbscript.dll base address in the following way.\n\n1. Because vbscript.dll imported msvcrt.dll, the msvcrt.dll base address was\n\nobtained by traversing the vbscript.dll import table, msvcrt.dll introduces\n\nkernelbase.dll, ntdll.dll, and finally the NtContinue, VirtualProtect function\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Bypass DEP to execute shellcode\n\n1. Use arbitrary reading and writing technique to modify the VAR type type\n\nto 0x4d, and then assign it with a value of 0 to make the virtual machine\n\nperform VAR:: Clear function.\n\n2. Control with caution and let the code Execute function ntdll!ZwContinue.\n\nThe first parameter CONTEXT structure was also constructed by the\n\nattacker.\n\n1. Control the code with caution to execute ntdll! ZwContinue function. The\n\nfirst parameter CONTEXT structure is also carefully constructed by the\n\nk\n\n\n-----\n\n1. The first parameter of ZwContinue is a pointer to the CONTEXT structure.\n\nThe CONTEXT structure is shown in the following figure, and the offset of\n\nEIP and ESP in CONTEXT can be calculated.\n\n5. The values of the Eip and Esp in the actual runtime CONTEXT and the\n\nattacker’s intention are shown in the figure below.\n\n\n-----\n\n## V Powershell Payload\n\nAfter the bait DOC file is executed, it will start to execute the Powershell\n\ncommand to the next step payload.\n\nFirst of all, Powershell will fuzzy match incoming parameter names, and it is\n\ncase-insensitive.\n\nSecond step, decrypt the obfuscated command.\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, the script uses a special User-Agent access URL page to request the next\n\nload and execute.\n\nThe size of the requested payload file is approximately 199K. The code\n\nfragment is as follows.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe found that this code was modified from invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.ps1[2].\n\nbuffer_x86 and buffer_x64 in the code are same function but from different\n\nversions of dll files File export module name: ReverseMet dll\n\n\n-----\n\n_https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire/blob/master/data/module_source/co_\n\n_de_execution/Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.ps1_\n\nDLL file decrypts ip address, port and sleep time from the configuration. After\n\nthe decryption algorithm xor 0xA4, and subtracted 0x34, the code is as follows.\n\nDecryption configuration file from the ip address 185.183.97.28 port 1021 to\n\nobtain the next load and execute. After it connects to the tcp port, it will get 4\n\nbytes to apply for a memory.\n\nSubsequent acquired writes into the new thread, and execute the acquired\n\nshellcode payload.\n\nSince the port of the sample CC server is closed, we cannot get the next load\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to use PowerShell to load the payload, the bait DOC file also runs\n\nrundll32.exe to execute another backdoor locally. There are several notable\n\nfeatures of the backdoor program it uses: the program uses COM port to copy\n\nfiles, realize UAC bypass and two system DLL hijacks; it also uses the default\n\nDLLs of cliconfg.exe and SearchProtocolHost.exe to take advantage of whitelist;\n\nfinally in the process of component delivery, use file steganography and\n\nmemory reflection loading method to avoid traffic monitoring and achieve no\n\nfile landing load.\n\n### 1. Retro backdoor execution\n\nThe backdoor program used in this attack is actually the Retro series backdoor\n\nknown to be used by the APT-C-06 organization. The following is a detailed\n\nanalysis of the implementation process of the backdoor program.\n\nFirst execute the DLL disguised as a zlib library function with rundll32 and\n\nexecute the backdoor installation functions uncompress2 and uncompress3.\n\n\n-----\n\nSearchProtocolHost.exe.\n\nCopy the DLL file in the AppData directory to the System32 directory through\n\nthe COM interface and name it msfte.dll and NTWDBLIB.dll.\n\nThen copy the file NTWDBLIB.dll to the System directory and execute the\n\nsystem’s own cliconfig to achieve DLL hijacking and load NTWDBLIB.dll.\n\nThe role of NTWDBLIB.dll is to restart the system service WSearch, and then\n\nstart msfte.dll.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe script will then generate and execute the MO4TH2H0.bat file in the TEMP\n\ndirectory, which will delete the NTWDBLIB.DLL and its own BAT from the system\n\ndirectory.\n\n\n-----\n\nMsfte.dll is the final backdoor program whose export is disguised as zlib. The\n\ncore export functions are AccessDebugTracer and AccessRetailTracer. Its main\n\nfunction is to communicate with CC and further download and execute\n\nsubsequent DLL programs.\n\nSimilar to the previously analyzed sample, it is also using image steganography\n\nand memory reflection loading. The decrypted CC communication information\n\nis as follows:\n\nThe format of the request is:\n\n\n-----\n\ntypes of M and H, inst parameter is the current installation id, name is the\n\nCC_name obtained by decryption, this time is pphp.\n\nAfter decryption after downloading, the process is exactly the same as the\n\nformat of the previous image steganography transmission. The decryption\n\nprocess this time is shown in the figure below:\n\nThe previously decrypted test sample decryption process is shown below:\n\nFor the CC URL corresponding to the test request, because we did not obtain\n\nthe corresponding image during the analysis, the CC is suspected to have\n\nfailed.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 2. Retro backdoor evolvement\n\nThe back door program used in the APT-C-06 organization’s early APT\n\noperation was Lucker. It is a set of self-developed and customized modular\n\nTrojans. The set of Trojans is powerful, with keyboard recording, voice\n\nrecording, screen capture, file capture and U disk operation functions, etc. The\n\nLucker ‘s name comes from the PDB path of this type of Trojan, because most of\n\nthe backdoor’s function use the LK abbreviation.\n\nIn the middle to late period we have discovered its evolution and two different\n\ntypes of backdoor programs. We have named them Retro and Collector by the\n\nPDB path extracted from the program. The Retro backdoor is an evolution of\n\nthe Lucker backdoor and it actives in a series of attacks from 2016 till now. The\n\nname comes from the pdb path of this type of Trojan with the label Retro, and\n\nalso has the word Retro in the initial installer.\n\n\n-----\n\nC:\\workspace\\Retro\\RetroDLL\\zlib1.pdb\n\nThe evolution of the reflective DLL injection technique can be found from the\n\nrelevant PDB paths, and there are a lot of variants of this series of backdoors.\n\n## VII Attribution\n\n### 1. Decryption Algorithm\n\nDuring the analysis, we found the decryption algorithm that malware used is\n\nidentical to APT-C-06’s decryption algorithm.\n\nThe decryption algorithm of this attack is as follow:\n\nThe decryption algorithm APT-C-06 used is as follow:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the further analysis, we found the same decryption algorithm was used in the\n\n64-bit version of the relevant malware.\n\n### 2. PDB Path\n\nThe PDB path of the malware used in this attack has a string of “Retro”. It is one\n\nspecific feature of Retro Trojan family.\n\n### 3. Victims\n\nIn the process of tracing victims, we found one special compromised machine.\n\nIt has a large amount of malware related to APT-C-06. By looking at these\n\nsamples in chronological order, the evolution of the malicious program can be\n\nclearly seen. The victim has been under constant attack acted by APT-C-06\n\nsince 2015. The early samples on the compromised machine could be\n\nassociated with DarkHotel. Then it was attacked by Lurker Trojan. Recently it\n\nwas under the attack exploiting 0-day vulnerabilities CVE-2018-8174.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT-C-06 is an overseas APT organization which has been active for a long\n\ntime. Its main targets are China and some other countries. Its main purpose is\n\nto steal sensitive data and conduct cyber-espionage. DarkHotel can be\n\nregarded as one of its series of attack activities.\n\nThe attacks against China specifically targeted government, scientific research\n\ninstitutions and some particular field. The attacks can be dated back to 2007\n\nand are still very active. Based on the evidence we have, the organization may\n\nbe a hacker group or intelligence agency supported by a foreign government.\n\nThe attacks against China have never stopped over the past 10 years. The\n\nTechniques the group uses keep evolving through time. Based on the data we\n\ncaptured in 2017, targets in China are trade related institutions and\n\nconcentrated in provinces that have frequent trading activities. The group has\n\nbeen conducting long-term monitoring on the targets to stole confidential data.\n\nDuring the decades of cyber attacks, APT-C-06 exploits several 0-day\n\nvulnerabilities and used complicated malware. It has dozens of function\n\nmodules and over 200 malicious codes.\n\nIn April, 2018, the Advanced Threat Response Team of 360 Core Security\n\nDivision takes the lead in capturing the group’s new APT attack using 0-day\n\nvulnerabilities (CVE-2018-8174) in the wild, and then discovers the new type\n\nattack – Office related attack exploiting 0-day VBScript vulnerabilities.\n\nAfter the capture of the new activity, we contacted Microsoft immediately and\n\nshared detailed information with them. Microsoft’s official security patch was\n\nreleased on 8th May Now we published this detailed report to disclose and\n\n\n-----\n\n## References\n\nhttps://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018\n8174\n\n## About\n\n360 Helios Team is the APT(Advanced Persistent Attack) research and analysis\n\nteam in Qihoo 360.\n\nThe team is dedicated in APT attack investigation, threat incident response and\n\nunderground economy industrial chain studies.\n\nSince the establishment in December, 2014, the team has successflly\n\nintegrated 360’s big data base and built up a quick reversing and corellation\n\n\n-----\n\n360 Helios also provides threat intelligence assessment and response solutions\n\nfor enterprises.\n\n[Contact: 360zhuiri@360.cn](mailto:360zhuiri@360.cn)\n\n[Posted in: 未分类](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/category/uncategorized/)\n\n[← Lock. 勒索病毒分析](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/lock-%e5%8b%92%e7%b4%a2%e7%97%85%e6%af%92%e5%88%86%e6%9e%90/) APT-C-06组织在全球范围内首例使用“双杀”0day\n\n[漏洞(CVE-2018-8174)发起的APT攻击分析及溯](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/cve-2018-8174/)\n\n源 →\n\n### 发表评论\n\n电子邮件地址不会被公开。 必填项已用*标注\n\n评论\n\n\n-----\n\n姓名 *\n\n电子邮件 *\n\n站点\n\n\n发表评论\n\n\n-----\n\nCopyright © 2018 奇虎360技术博客 [Primer WordPress theme by GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/)\n\n\n-----",
