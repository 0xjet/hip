However, between noon and 5pm Moscow time, the REvil operation stated that\nthe REvil domain was accessed using Unknown’s keys, confirming their concerns that a\nthird-party has backups with their service keys The REvil operator added that the REvil\n\n\n-----\n\nserver was compromised and the hijacker deleted 0-neday s access to their hidden admin\nserver. 0_neday believes the hijacker was looking for them. 0_neday signed off XSS and\nwished the participants “good luck”\n\nFlashpoint analysts note that this was an unexpected turn in REvil’s attempt to reconstitute\n[their operations, as the group had just begun recruiting new affiliates on the RAMP forum,](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/revil-continues-reemergence-on-ramp-forum/)\n[and offering unusually high commissions of 90 percent to attract affiliates. Flashpoint](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/interview-with-revil-affiliated-ransomware-contractor/)\nanalysts are tracking the situation and will provide updates as they arise.\n\nUsers on XSS were generally incredulous at this new announcement. The spokesperson of\nthe LockBit ransomware gang claimed this new disappearance is proof that the REvil reemergence in September was part of an elaborate FBI plot to catch REvil affiliates. Several\nthreat actors agreed with the Lockbit representative and added that they believed that REvil\n[will re-emerge again under a totally new name, leaving behind recent scandals without](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/revils-cryptobackdoor-con-ransomware-groups-tactics-roil-affiliates-sparking-a-fallout/)\nhaving to pay out old affiliates. Another threat actor added, paraphrasing Shakespeare,\n“Something is rotten in the state of ransomware.”\n\nOn October 18, at 10AM EST, the XSS moderators closed the thread where REvil made the\nannouncement and advised fellow users to block REvil accounts.\n\n\n-----",
