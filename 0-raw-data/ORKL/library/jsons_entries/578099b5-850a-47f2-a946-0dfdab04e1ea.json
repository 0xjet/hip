It is known to encrypt documents, databases, videos,\nor photos after it infects the whole system. The files become inaccessible for the victims,\nwhere Robinhood’ Goodwill’ asks the victim to donate for socially driven activities to get their\nfiles back. For example: ‘Goodwill Ransomware forces victims to donate new clothes to the\nhomeless, provide financial assistance to the poor, and many more. They then ask victims to\npost it online.\n\nHowever, a few more ransomware have other motives to force victims to do some act to\nretrieve their infected files. Quick heal published a blog about Sarbloh Ransomware related\nto the Farmer Protests and was not demanding any ransom. Similarly, Goodwill ransomware\nacts as a Robin Hood and forces victims to help the poor. Let us look into more detail about\nthis ransomware and how the attacker gets hold of the files in the system.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nLet us analyse the hash (MD5: cea1cb418a313bdc8e67dbd6b9ea05ad). This is a .NET\nCompiled file. This executable is packed with Fody; hence we can see only the main routine.\n\nWe can also observe references to Costura.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig 1: Costura References_\n\nThis Costura is a plugin for Fody that allows the developers to embed all the dependencies\nin the form of resources packed inside the final dotNET executable.\n\n_Fig2: Plugin_\n\nIt can be seen in the above image how the embedded dependencies are fetched and\nunpacked.\n\nUpon execution it connects to URL hxxp[:]//9855-13-235-50-147.ngrok[.]io/alertmsg[.]zip and\ndownloads alertmsg.zip file into location: C:\\Users\\Public\\Windows\\Ui\n\n\n-----\n\nAll the content related to Ransom notes and encryption information is in the zip file. This\nexecutable coordinates with the contents of the zip. It encrypts the files with the extension\n“.gdwill.”\n\nTo recover the files, 3 activities need to be performed as shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig 3: Ransom note_\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter completing all the given activities, the details must be sent to the email in the below\nformat:\n\n_Fig 4: Email Format_\n\nThe ransomware attackers ask the victims to provide convincing evidence for the activities to\nprove it done. After which, the person orchestrating this threat will provide a decryption tool\nto recover the stolen files. Let us look at how the threat actors hack and encrypt the files via\nthe given below snapshot.\n\n_Fig 6: Encryption_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Encryption Process\n\n1.GeneratePassword: A password is randomly generated and then base64 encoded. The\nSHA256 of this base64 encoded data which later forms the key for encryption (AES)\n\n2. GenerateSystemId: SystemID of the victim’s machine is obtained\n\n3. CheckConnection: Pings google.com and checks if the internet is working\n\n4. MakeConnection: Uploads the password and SystemID to the server along with location\nand IP\n\n5.RetrieveFiles: AES Encryption is done on files with extension with a key generated in\nStep1 .pptx,.docx,.xlsx,.txt,.pdf,.500,.jpeg,.jpg,.png\n\n6. AlertingUser: Launches index.html(containing ransom note) via launch.bat present in the\nalertmsg.zip\n\n_Fig 7: Batch file for alert_\n\nThis malware also sleeps for a few seconds to bypass the analysis.\n\nAt last, it was found that this ransomware was derived from an Open-source Jasmin\n[Encryptor, which can be found on https://github.com/codesiddhant/Jasmin-Ransomware.](https://github.com/codesiddhant/Jasmin-Ransomware)\n\n## How do we prevent such kinds of attacks?\n\nTo keep ourselves secure from such attacks, follow the great saying “Prevention is better\nthan Cure”! The infection vector is usually in the form of mails, so do not open attachments\nfrom an untrusted sender. Do not enable macros in the Doc received mainly from\ncorrespondences. Avoid clicking on unverified links and those in spam emails. Keep your\nsoftware and antivirus updated. Always remember to back up your data so that you can\nrecover it even in case of a ransomware attack.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the content above, we have looked into how Goodwill Ransom is related to Open-source\nJasmin. It has modified the open-source for, e.g., In Jasmin, files are encrypted with the\n“.jasmin” extension, whereas GoodWill files are encrypted with “.gdwill.” In Jasmin, hosted\npoints to localhost, whereas Goodwill points to external C2. This ransomware was unique\nbecause of its charitable nature instead of demanding money. The strings present in the file,\nsuch as “Error h bhaiyya,” seems that the routes of this hack were generated in India.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Indicators of compromise (IOC)**\n\ncea1cb418a313bdc8e67dbd6b9ea05ad\n\n**QuickHeal Protection**\n\nTrojan.YakbeexMSIL.ZZ4\n\n**Tejaswini Sandapolla**\n\n[Follow @](https://twitter.com/)\n\n\n-----",
