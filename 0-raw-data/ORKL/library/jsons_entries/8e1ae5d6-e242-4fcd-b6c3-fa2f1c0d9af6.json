The malware made](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html)\nheadlines across the globe, as it was a sophisticated piece of malware developed by a\nnation state, infecting half a million devices, and poised to cause havoc. Yet the attack was\naverted. The attacker’s command and control (C2) infrastructure was seized by the FBI,\npreventing the attacker from broadcasting orders to compromised devices. The attacker lost\ncontrol of the infected systems, and potential catastrophe was prevented.\n\nThis was a wakeup call that alerted the cybersecurity community to a new kind of statesponsored threat — a vast network of compromised devices across the globe that could stow\naway secrets, hide the origins of attacks and shut down networks.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is the story of VPNFilter, and the catastrophe that was averted.\n\n## Network as the target\n\nNetwork infrastructure is a tempting and useful target to attackers. Like any computing\nsystem, network devices such as routers and switches may contain vulnerabilities or\nmisconfigurations that allow attackers to compromise the device. Once compromised, the\ndevice can be used as a point of incursion to search out and attack additional further\nsystems, or the functionality of the device can be changed to the attacker’s will, and network\ntraffic intercepted, modified or rerouted. Unlike many other computing systems, routers and\nswitches are unlikely to be running anti-virus software, or be under active supervision by\neagle-eyed administrators who may notice unusual activity.\n\nIn the weeks prior to the disclosure of VPNFilter, it was clear that network infrastructure was\nincreasingly the target of state-sponsored threat actors. The activities of a threat actor\nassociated with Russia had been observed and government agencies across the world\n[published advisories warning organisations to take note1,2,3.](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=1029833275466591797#1)\n\n## Traces of VPNFilter\n\nSomeone registered the unobtrusive domain toknowall.com in December 2015. On May 4\n2017 that domain was changed to point to an IP address hosted in France after it initially\npointed at a Bulgarian hosting provider. Although nobody knew it at the time, this was one of\nthe means by which the attackers were communicating with VPNFilter. This domain would\nremain active until the threat was neutralised on May 23, 2018.\n\n\nBy the end of August 2017, the FBI had been made aware of a home router exhibiting\nunusual behaviour. The device attempted to connect to a Photobucket account to download\n[an image, behaviour that was clearly being driven by a malware infection .4](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=1029833275466591797#4)\n\nIn fact, both the Photobucket accounts and the toknowall.com domain were hosting images\nin which the IP address of the C2 server, used by the threat actor to issue instructions to the\nmalware were hidden, disguised within the EXIF metadata of the image.\n\nBy March 2018, additional malware samples were discovered that also reached out to\nPhotobucket, and used toknowall.com as a backup in case Photobucket was unavailable.\nAnalysing the malware samples showed that the threat actor let an important clue slip.\n\nTo keep important data within the malware confidential, the malicious code used encryption,\nimplementing the RC4 encryption algorithm. However, the code implementing this algorithm\nincluded a subtle error, a mistake that was identical to exhibited by code used in the\n\n\n-----\n\n[BlackEnergy attacks against Ukraine and elsewhere . This code reuse from one attack to](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=1029833275466591797#5)\nanother allowed government agencies to identify that this attack originated from the group\n[known as APT28 or “Sofacy.”6](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=1029833275466591797#6)\n\n## BlackEnergy and APT28\n\nEach threat actor group has their own mode of operation, preferences, and characteristics\nthat they display as part of their attacks. For example, Group 123 is known to conduct\n[attacks by distributing documents that reference politics on the Korean peninsula .7](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=1029833275466591797#7) In\ncontrast, the threat actor Rocke seeks to install cryptocurrency mining software on\n[compromised devices by downloading code from Git repositories .8](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=1029833275466591797#8) Threat actors frequently\nreuse code or infrastructure, which allows researchers to identify specific threat actor groups\n[and track their campaigns .9](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=1029833275466591797#9)\n\n\nAPT28, also known as Sofacy or Grizzly Steppe, is one of many threat actors that are\nfollowed by analysts. There is little doubt that this threat actor is part of the Russian\n[Intelligence Services, that it is particularly active, and that it can cause chaos10,11.](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=1029833275466591797#10)\n\nThe BlackEnergy attack was one of the most notorious attacks from this group. BlackEnergy\ndisrupted electrical power distributions in Ukraine in December 2015, which caused\n[widespread power outages across the country .7](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=1029833275466591797#7) A particular characteristic of this attack was\na component that wiped disks, rendering infected devices inoperable and destroying forensic\nevidence which could have been used to understand exactly how the attack was\n[conducted12.](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=1029833275466591797#12)\n\n\nThis intent to destroy systems and prevent recovery was one of the factors that made is so\nimportant to respond to VPNFilter swiftly.\n\n## Capability and intent\n\nVPNFilter managed to exploit various network devices and affected over 500 000 devices in\nat least 54 countries. The modular architecture of the malware allowed the threat actor to\ninstall various different modules to conduct different malicious activities from the infected\ndevices.\n\nAt its simplest, the malware contained the ability to ‘brick’ or render permanently inoperable\nthe infected devices. Alternatively, the malware could be used as a point of ingress on a\nnetwork, and subsequently used to discover and attack other systems connected to the\naffected device. One particular module contained functionality to identify and monitor\nModbus network traffic, a protocol widely used in Industrial Control Systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nA further module allowed the malware to create a giant Tor network comprising the many\ncompromised systems. This network potentially allowed attackers to disguise the ultimate\ndestination of data stolen from other compromised systems, or the country of origin of\nattacks against systems.\n\nClearly, capturing data, especially usernames and passwords, was one goal of the attack.\nThe malware was capable of downgrading encrypted https connections to an unencrypted\nhttp connection, then saving that traffic for future collection. Similarly, anything that looked\nlike a user credential or authorisation token could be identified, recorded, and subsequently\ncollected.\n\nSince the malware infected routers that direct network traffic to its intended destination, the\nmalware could modify the routing information and create custom destinations for certain\ntraffic; redirecting traffic from the genuine destination to a separate system under the control\nof the attackers. All of this is achieved without alerting the end user that anything was amiss.\n\n## The response\n\nThe number of affected systems grew throughout the spring of 2018. However, sharp spikes\nin the numbers of new infections were observed on May 8 and 17. This sudden growth was\nalmost exclusively within Ukraine which pointed to imminent preparation of an attack.\n\nAt this point, Talos worked with partner organisations in the private and public sector to\n[neutralise the threat. The FBI led efforts to seize the C2 infrastructure,6](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=1029833275466591797#6) and in parallel, Talos\ninformed members of the industry coalition group, the Cyber Threat Alliance, to ensure that\n[the whole cyber security industry could act together to neutralise the threat 13.](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=1029833275466591797#13)\n\n\nThe response was closely coordinated. Law enforcement took down the C2 infrastructure,\ncutting the ability of the attacker to send commands to the infected systems. The cyber\nsecurity industry updated security products to detect and block VPNFilter, and issued advice\nto users on how to protect themselves.\n\nWe will never know the exact nature of the attack that was averted. The timing of the growth\nof infections suggested that Ukranian Constitution Day on June 29, the anniversary of\nNotPetya on June 27, or Orthodox Pentecost Monday on May 28 may have been target\ndates. The Security Service of Ukraine suggested that the attack would have been timed to\n[disrupt the UEFA Champions League Final, which was taking place in Kiev on May 2614.](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=1029833275466591797#14)\n\n## Protection\n\nVPNFilter partly resided in memory, and partly on the storage media of the devices it\ninfected. Rebooting the device would clear the memory resident part of the malware, but not\nstop the malware component residing in the device storage from initiating contact with the\n\n\n-----\n\ncommand and control systems. However, once that C2 was disabled, the persistent part of\nthe malware could no longer receive instructions.\n\nThe remnants of the malware can be cleared by resetting devices to factory settings,\nfollowed by patching to the latest version to remove vulnerabilities. Although it is still unclear\nwhich vulnerabilities were exploited to install VPNFilter, all the types of devices that were\ncompromised had known existing vulnerabilities.\n\nGiven their position in the network topology, perimeter network devices are always going to\nbe exposed to attack. Unpatched devices with known vulnerabilities that are exposed to the\ninternet are ripe for compromise by threat actors such as APT28.\n\nKeeping such devices fully patched and correctly configured are vital parts of network\nhygiene. However, if this can’t be assured, then devices need to be placed behind next\ngeneration firewalls to detect and block the attacks before they impact on the vulnerable\ndevice.\n\nVigilance is also part of good network hygiene. VPNFilter was first detected by identifying the\nunusual network behaviour of an infected device. The network is ideally placed to be the\nsensor that detects and informs us of the actions of the bad guys.\n\n## Conclusion & Aftermath\n\nTogether, Talos and the FBI worked to identify and characterise VPNFilter. The malware’s\nmulti-stage [modular platform supported both intelligence-collection and destructive cyber](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/09/vpnfilter-part-3.html)\nattack operations. The campaign managed to infect over 500 000 devices in at least 54\ncountries. This malware could have been used to conduct a large-scale destructive attack,\nwhich would have rendered infected physical devices unusable and cut off internet access\nfor hundreds of thousands of users. However, identification and characterisation of the\nthreat, coupled with a coordinated response across the public and private sectors, stopped\nthe attack before a catastrophe occurred.\n\nThe degree of collaboration across different organisations was unprecedented. There is\nalways a balance to tread between keeping information private in order to maintain\noperational security, and sharing between partners to act together, maximising the impact\nagainst the threat actor to reduce the severity of an attack. There is evidence to suggest that\nTalos’ early engagement of the Cyber Threat Alliance in the case of VPNFilter has had a\nlasting legacy, helping to encourage others to engage in earlier, and more frequent sharing of\n[data13.](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=1029833275466591797#13)\n\nThe various malicious modules identified for VPNFilter give us an insight into the objectives\nand desires of the threat actor. Notably, infecting routers allows the threat actor to reroute\nnetwork traffic from the intended legitimate destination to a malicious destination under the\n\n\n-----\n\ncontrol of the attacker. Potentially this ability can be used to collect further usernames and\npasswords, and also to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks by intercepting and reading\nnetwork traffic before passing it on to the intended destination.\n\nAPT28 is only one example of the many threat actors who continue to attempt destructive\n[attacks. Talos recently discovered the Sea Turtle campaign. Although the unknown threat](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/04/seaturtle.html)\nactor behind the attack is different from APT28, they also sought to reroute internet traffic in\norder to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks and collect user credentials. However, they\nachieved their objectives by a completely different approach than VPNFilter, by attacking the\n[internet’s DNS infrastructure15.](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=1029833275466591797#15)\n\nClearly, network infrastructure is in the sights of nation-state threat actors. We can expect\nthat attackers will continue to seek to compromise these systems and continue to refine and\ndevelop the malware that they use to achieve their goals. Attackers can only learn from past\nfailures. In the inevitable next wave of attacks, we can expect to see malware that leaves\nfewer traces in network traffic and has a more sophisticated C2 infrastructure that is more\nresistant to disruption.\n\nThe network is at the heart of our professional and social lives, and increasingly, our physical\nenvironment. The little devices that connect us to the network are often overlooked, but it is\nthese systems allow our critical national infrastructure and enterprises to function.\n\nVPNFilter teaches us that attackers have not overlooked the importance of these systems,\nand that those who may be seeking to disrupt our societies look to strike at the network.\nHowever, in attempting to conduct this attack, the threat actors have let slip their\ntechnologies and the capabilities that they are trying to develop. These clues help us in\nknowing where to look and how to search for the next attack in preparation.\n\nTalos continues to use its unparalleled visibility of threats to analyse the changing threat\nlandscape and to act together with partners to protect customers. Nevertheless, cyber\nsecurity is everyone’s concern. We all have our part to play in protecting against the next\nattack by ensuring that we have adequate security protection, and that all our devices\nconnected to the network are kept updated and fully patched.\n\nWe don’t know what the next major attack will be, but we continue to search for the hints and\nclues of an impending attack, so that we can disrupt the activity and stop catastrophes\nbefore they happen.\n\n## References\n\n[1].
