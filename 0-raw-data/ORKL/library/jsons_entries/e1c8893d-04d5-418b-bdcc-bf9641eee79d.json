Along similar lines, we recently\ncame across a new malware campaign that uses a similar AutoIt script to deliver a new\nvariant of the CyberGate RAT and RedLine stealer.\n\nThis blog will walk you through a detailed analysis of the payload delivery mechanism,\ncapabilities, and Command and Control (C&C) communication. We also observed the\nusage of custom C&C protocols to exfiltrate sensitive information. We will shed light on the\ncustom protocol used by the Cybergate RAT.\n\nBelow is the detection timeline for AutoIt malware campaigns in the past month. We\nobserved several hits for the AutoIt malware involving various malware families, including\nAZOrult, Xtreme RAT, Taurus stealer, RedLine Stealer, and CyberGate RAT. The Zscaler\nThreatLabZ team is closely monitoring the developments on these campaigns to ensure\ncoverage.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Hits of AutoIt-based malware in the past month._\n\nZscaler Cloud Sandbox captured the CyberGate RAT and RedLine stealer successfully. We\nobserved that both of them are packed with the same packer and use the same payload\ndelivery mechanism. The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in these two\ncampaigns are similar in nature, so we suspect that the same actors are behind these\nattacks.\n\n**Payload delivery mechanism**\n\nAs observed in a previous blog, the source of the stealer was spam mail containing a link to\ndownload the malware or an attached DOC file that downloads the malware. While tracking\nthis campaign, we found that this malware is served by phishing sites. At the time of our\nanalysis, we found a live phishing site of a cryptocurrency blockchain exchange called\nResistance, which is serving the RedLine stealer.\n\nFigure 2: A crypto blockchain exchange phishing site.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Wrapper analysis**\n\nThe files downloaded from these phishing sites are self-extracting archives (SFX), which\ncontain a cabinet file and a script to execute embedded files. The cabinet file can be found\nunder the RCData resource directory with the name ‘CABINET’ and command for execution\nin the resource directory of the name ‘RUNPROGRAM’.\n\n_Figure 3: The resource directory of the wrapper file._\n\nThe cabinet file contains three files with a ‘com’ extension and the file names are random\nand different in other AutoIt scripts. Those files are:\n\nffXi.com - This is a legit Autoit3.exe having an invalid header used to run AutoIt scripts\nadCt.com - A Windows Base64 encoded AutoIt script by certutil\nbzYfp.com - The encrypted payload\n\nThe command-line script present in the ‘RUNPROGRAM’ resource directory to execute\nembedded files is shown below:\n\n_cmd /c <nul set /p =\"M\" > lsass.com & type ffXi.com >> lsass.com & del ffXi.com & certutil -_\n_decode adCt.com R & lsass.com R & ping 127.0.0.1 -n 20_\n\nFirst, it corrects the header of ‘ffXi.com’ (Autoit3.exe) by appending “M”, stores it in\n‘lsass.com’, then it deletes ‘ffXi.com’. After that, it decodes the Base64 encoded AutoIt\nscript using ‘certutil’ with the parameter “-decode”, saves it to a file “R”, and then runs this\nAutoIt script with Autoit3.exe (lsass.com). In the end, it uses the ping command as a sleep\ntimer.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe AutoIt script uses custom obfuscation and all the hardcoded strings are encrypted in\nthe malware, as we have seen previously in this campaign. Upon execution, the AutoIt\nscript drops and hides the following four files in the directory “%APPDATA%\\\\cghost” for\nachieving persistency on the system. We found this persistency technique in the AutoIt\nscript only if the final payload is RAT.\n\ncghost.com - Copy of AutoIt interpreter\naGuDP - Copy of Autoit script\nbzYfp.com - Copy of encrypted payload\ndLzSj.vbs - VBS script to execute AutoIt interpreter with the script\n\nThe VBS file contains:\n\n_CGXdBksrYqQnDIwn =_\n_GetObject(\"winmgmts:\\\\.\\root\\cimv2:Win32_Process\").Create(\"%appdata%\\cghost\\cghost.com_\n_%appdata%\\cghost\\aGuDP\", \"%appdata%\\cghost\", Null, OJxMEkRRELvrj )_\n\nFor persistence, it creates an internet shortcut file ‘cghost.url’ in the startup directory with\nthe following contents:\n\n_[InternetShortcut]_\n_URL=\"%APPDATA%\\cghost\\dLzSj.vbs\"_\n\nThe AutoIt script has multiple sandbox evasion tricks to avoid detection. It also checks to\nsee if a file and computer name exists in the system and checks for a particular domain.\n\n_Figure 4: The malware performs multiple checks before execution._\n\nThis malware wrapper avoids its execution in the Windows defender antivirus simulator by\nchecking for the presence of the “C:\\aaa_TouchMeNot.txt” file in the system. The malware\nterminates execution if it finds the following computer names, which are used by AV\nemulators:\n\n“NfZtFbPfH” - Kaspersky\n\n“tz” - Bitdefender\n\n“ELICZ” - AVG\n\n\n-----\n\nMAIN - VBA\n“DESKTOP-QO5QU33” - Assuming this is the attacker’s machine name\n\nIt checks for the sleep API patch with 'GetTickCount' to detect the sandbox emulation. It\nalso checks for the domain ‘OJtmGmql.OJtmGmql’, it will exit if the domain is alive. These\nare random strings and found to be different in every other wrapper. If it passes all the\nabove checks then it injects the shellcode for the 'RC4' algorithm based on the system\narchitecture into the specified running process or the current process memory.\n\n_Figure 5: The RC4 algorithm shellcode._\n\nThe RC4 key is XOR-encrypted in the AutoIt script which can be found in a function calling\nalong with the encrypted data and process path for injection.\n\n_Figure 6: The encrypted RC4 key._\n\nThis RC4 key is found to be different in every case. The AutoIt script reads the encrypted\npayload (bzYfp.com) and decrypts it using the RC4 shellcode with the hardcoded key\n“537180” (in this case).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: The RC4 algorithm in the first shellcode._\n\nAfter that, it injects another shellcode in the memory, which creates a mutex first with the\nname of ‘JFTZRATSJPATTZLFCUTTH’, then it takes the decrypted PE file, injects it into the\nprocess, and executes it.\n\nThe final payload is decrypted and executed in the memory only so it will not get captured\nby the antivirus if it has static detection.\n\nWe have written a python script to decrypt the encrypted payload, which can be found in\nAppendix I.\n\nThe payloads dropped by this wrapper are CyberGate RAT or RedLine stealer.\n\n**CyberGate RAT**\n\nThe CyberGate RAT from this campaign looks like a new variant that we have not seen in\nthe past. CyberGate allows an attacker to browse and manipulate files, devices, and\nsettings on the victim's machine as well as download and execute additional malware. It\nalso has a wide range of information stealing abilities, such as keyloggers, screen capture,\nand remote enabling of webcams.\n\nThe capabilities of the CyberGate RAT that we found in this variant include:\n\n\n-----\n\nCollecting the system info\nCreating a specified directory\nDownloading and executes additional files\nGetting the content of a specified file\nStealing the browser’s credentials\nCapturing the screen\nRunning a keylogger\n\nThe C&C address and port information are encrypted and hardcoded in the binary.\nEncryption is simple XOR with the hardcoded key “2qYNYM2Z74XL”.\n\n_Figure 8: The XOR decryption of the encrypted IP address._\n\nThe unique bot ID is created by adding the username, computer name, and the serial\nnumber of the victim machine and calculating the MD5 hash.\n\nBot ID = MD5(UserName+ComputerName+SerialNumber)\n\n_Figure 9: Bot ID creation._\n\n**Network traffic analysis**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis variant of CyberGate RAT has a hardcoded and encrypted C&C IP address and it uses\na 3970 port to communicate on the TCP protocol. The complete traffic is compressed with\nzlib compression and encrypted with RC4 with the hardcoded key present in the binary.\n\n_Figure 10: CyberGate network traffic._\n\n_Figure 11: Packet structure._\n\nClient and server packets are encrypted or decrypted by RC4 with the same hardcoded key\n“draZwyK8wNHF”, which is present in the binary. After the decryption of server packets, the\n[data starts with the marker of 14 bytes “@@[email protected]@” and followed by the zlib](https://www.zscaler.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\ncompressed data. We have seen this marker in the previous version of Cybergate RAT.\n\nFigure 12: The decrypted packet data.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter decompression, the data starts with the command followed by the parameters and\nseparated by the marker “##$##”.\n\n_Structure: <Command>##$##<Parameters>##$##_\n\nFigure 13: The decrypted communication between the client and the C&C server.\n\nIn the first request, the command will send the calculated unique bot ID to the server.\n\nThe second command will search for the stored credentials in the Chrome and Firefox\nbrowser profiles. If it matches the parameters, then it sends the credentials to the server\nalong with the machine info, including socket name, user name, computer name, product\nname, and bot ID.\n\nFigure 14: The credentials and machine info that is sent to the server.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe command Ky8pr22KrbW3 or neAWM9TC4tsk creates the specified directory in the\n%appdata%. It then downloads and stores the specified file inside and executes it.\n\nFigure 15: The command to download and execute additional malware.\n\nWe have found the following commands in this variant of the CyberGate RAT.\n\n**Commands** **Descriptions**\n\n4hybWKLmEShM Send the unique bot ID to the server\n\nECDnG66CYsZc Steal the browser’s credentials and machine info\n\ndYh3GKy2DK Store data to the registry\n\nKy8pr22KrbW3 Download and execute additional malware\n\nneAWM9TC4tsk Download and execute additional malware and exit itself\n\nEffNaMNRW43T Capture the screen\n\n5Qvape9Wv6eA Start the keylogger\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have written a python script to decrypt the CyberGate RAT and C&C traffic. It can be\nfound in Appendix II.\n\n**RedLine stealer**\n\nThe final payload is the .NET binary file of RedLine stealer. This stealer is available for sale\non Russian forums and was seen before in a COVID-themed email campaign. Proofpoint\n[published a blog about that campaign.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/new-redline-stealer-distributed-using-coronavirus-themed-email-campaign)\n\nThe capabilities of this stealer include:\n\nCollecting information about the victim’s system\nCollecting credentials, cookies, credit cards from Chromium- and Gecko-based\nbrowsers\nCollecting data from FTP clients (FileZilla, WinSCP)\nCollecting data from IM clients (Pidgin)\nCollecting cryptocurrency wallets\nDownloading and executing the specified file\n\n_Figure 16: The RedLine stealer classes and C&C domain._\n\nThe RedLine stealer uses SOAP over HTTP protocol for its C&C communication.\n\nAfter getting connected with the C&C server, RedLine fetches the client configuration\nsettings from the server.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17: Fetching the client configuration settings._\n\nThis client configuration settings include GrabBrowsers, GrabFTP, GrabFiles,\nGrabImClients, GrabPaths, GrabUserAgent, and GrabWallets.\n\n_Figure 18: The RedLine client configuration settings._\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter collecting the data as per the configuration, it sends all the data back to the server.\n\n_Figure 19: Sending the stolen data to server._\n\nAfter that, it sends the request to the server to get the task to download a file, execute a file,\naccess a link, or inject a file to a process along with the victim’s machine info, such as IP,\nlocation, OS, and more.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 20: Sending the request to the server to get a task._\n\n**Coverage**\n\nThe observed indicators in this attack were successfully blocked by the Zscaler Cloud\nSandbox.\n\n_Figure 21: The Zscaler Cloud Sandbox report for the CyberGate RAT._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 22: The Zscaler Cloud Sandbox report for the RedLine stealer._\n\nIn addition to sandbox detections, Zscaler’s multilayered cloud security platform detects\nindicators at various levels.\n\nThe following is the advanced threat protection signatures released for detecting the\nmalware:\n\n[Win32.Backdoor.CyberGate](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=Win32.Backdoor.CyberGate)\n\n[Win32.Backdoor.RedLine](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=Win32.Backdoor.Redline)\n\n[Win32.PWS.AutoIT](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=Win32.PWS.AutoIT)\n\nAnd the following are the Cloud IPS (non-web) signatures that enable detection of the\nCyberGate RAT:\n\n[Win32.Backdoor.CyberGate](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=Win32.Backdoor.CyberGate)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe are observing an increase in the usage of AutoIt script as a wrapper to deliver malware\nby threat actors. This trend appears to be getting stronger with a lot of obfuscation, antianalysis and anti-sandbox tricks, and fileless techniques being adopted by the AutoIt-based\nmalware. The final payloads we have seen in these campaigns are RATs and Infostealers,\nwhich are capable of stealing sensitive information and installing additional malware. Also,\nthe usage of a custom protocol for the exfiltration of sensitive information poses a great\nchallenge for network security solutions to block the data exfiltration attempt.\n\nThe Zscaler ThreatLabZ team will continue to monitor AutoIT-based malware campaigns to\nshare the information with the community and to keep our customers safe.\n\n\n-----\n\n**[MITRE ATT&CK™ tactic and technique mapping](https://attack.mitre.org/)**\n\n**Tactic        Technique**\nT1059        Execution through Command-Line interface\nT1060        Persistence in startup directory\nT1055        Process injection\nT1140        Obfuscated files\nT1503        Steal credentials from web browsers\nT1056        Keylogging\nT1539        Steal web session cookies\nT1083        File and Directory Discovery\nT1057        Process Discovery\nT1012        Query Registry\nT1082        System Information Discovery\nT1497        Sandbox Evasion\nT1005        Collect Data from Local System\nT1113        Captures Screen\nT1094        Custom C&C Protocol\nT1132        Base64 Data Encoding\nT1065        Uncommonly Used Port\nT1002        Data Compressed\nT1020        Data Exfiltration\nT1022        Data Encrypted\n\n**IOCs**\n\nCybergate RAT\n37.252.5[.]213/55.exe (Download URL)\n37.252.5[.]213[:]3970 (Cybergate C&C)\n433dd4dce13e86688a3af13686c84d1c Packed file\n608D98351812A3C2C73B94A6F5BEF048 Encoded autoit file\n340F2664D7956A753D8EA2FA5C0044FF Encrypted payload\n53A116D2B8AB11B92B293B4AD18CC523 Decoded autoit script\n391317CC132C65561811316324171F8C Shellcode 1\n63CFBCE717C7761B6802E3C1B1F8ACCF Shellcode 2\n88A81C67556D4470F23F703D64606E16 Cybergate RAT\n\nRedLine Stealer\nresisproject[.]me (Phishing site)\nbbuseruploads[.]s3[.]amazonaws[.]com/583b9547-e88c-4247-a01e655ff985a7ae/downloads/5a2556c5-ec0f-4699-b67c-40b9f2a43fc7/Resistance_Walletwindows-2.2.9.zip (Download URL)\nresisproject[.]cc (Phishing site)\nbitbucket[ ]org/kapow37047/win64/downloads/ResistanceWallet 2 2 8 exe (Download URL)\n\n\n-----\n\nyellowbag[.]top (RedLine C&C)\n70EFF6AE73C0E276D385929D9E253D02 Packed file\nC96BF5CECA92A5362F342A7EE19FDC88 Encoded autoit file\nF1AA91851E0F66AAC3F65E4C237E8B51 Encrypted payload\n106FCC5A6B51E4B2213694C7B5FF3C08 Decoded autoit script\n729BB625379513FC677606888941248B RedLine Stealer\n4B0F5B53264C56125BD5C889E063BBCA Packed file\n67E67250B0DB02F824804EC17A757B1E Encoded autoit file\n67BB52ECFE627A96076AFAFD2DDE32C7 Encrypted payload\n293918878C0CE8CFFBD344B16EAC656E Decoded autoit script\n9E286AB918E5FACF45B2AE0195CEF54B RedLine Stealer\n\n**Appendix I**\n\nPython Script to decrypt encrypted Cybergate payload and RedLine payload:\n\nimport sys\nfrom Crypto.Cipher import ARC4\n\n#RC4 keys\nkeys = ['537180', '7010', ‘2379’]\n\nenc_file = sys.argv[1]\ndec_file = sys.argv[2]\n\nfor key in keys:\ncipher = ARC4.new(key)\ndata = open(enc_file, 'rb').read()\nout = cipher.decrypt(data)\n\nif out[:2] == \"MZ\":\nwith open(dec_file, 'wb') as wf:\nwf.write(out)\nprint(\"[+] Decrypted PE file - \" + dec_file)\nbreak\n\n**Appendix II**\n\nPython Script to decrypt & decompress Cybergate traffic:\n\nimport zlib\nfrom Crypto.Cipher import ARC4\n\ndef dec_packet(packet):\n\n\n-----\n\nresult =\nmarker = \"##$##\"\n#packet = str(bytearray.fromhex(packet))\n\nif len(packet) == 2:\nreturn result\ntry:\nif packet.startswith(\"\\x0d\\x0a\"):\npacket = packet[2:]\npacket = packet.split(marker)[1]\nif packet.startswith(\"\\x0d\\x0a\"):\npacket = packet[2:]\nexcept:\npass\n\ntry:\nkey = b'draZwyK8wNHF'\ncipher = ARC4.new(key)\n\nrc4_out = cipher.decrypt(packet)\n[if rc4_out.startswith(\"@@[email protected]@\"):](https://www.zscaler.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\nrc4_out = rc4_out[14:]\nresult = zlib.decompress(rc4_out)\nreturn result\nexcept:\nreturn result\n\n\n-----",
