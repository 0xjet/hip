We assess with high**\n\n\n**confidence that Group 123 was responsible for the following six campaigns:�**\n\n**Decept**\n\n\n**\"Golden Time\" campaign.**\n\n**\"Evil New Year\" campaign.**\n\n**\"Are you Happy?\" campaign.**\n\n**\"FreeMilk\" campaign.**\n\n\n**Mutiny Fuzzer**\n\n\n-----\n\n**On January 2nd of 2018, the \"Evil New Year 2018\" was started. This campaign copies the**\n\n**approach of the 2017 \"Evil New Year\" campaign.**\n\n**The links between the different campaigns include shared code and compiler artifacts such as**\n\n**PDB (Program DataBase) patterns which were present throughout these campaigns.**\n\n**Based on our analysis, the \"Golden Time\", both \"Evil New Year\" and the \"North Korean Human**\n\n**Rights\" campaigns specifically targeted South Korean users. The attackers used spear�**\n\n**phishing emails combined with malicious HWP documents created using Hancom Hangul**\n\n**Office Suite. Group 123 has been known to use exploits (such as CVE-2013-0808) or scripting�**\n\n**languages harnessing OLE objects. The purpose of the malicious documents was to install and**\n\n**to execute ROKRAT, a remote administration tool (RAT). On occasion the attackers directly**\n\n**included the ROKRAT payload in the malicious document and during other campaigns the**\n\n**attackers leveraged multi-stage infection processes: the document only contained a**\n\n**downloader designed to download ROKRAT from a compromised web server.**\n\n**Additionally, the \"FreeMilk\" campaign targeted several non-Korean financial institutions. In this�**\n\n**campaign, the attackers made use of a malicious Microsoft Office document, a deviation from�**\n\n**their normal use of Hancom documents. This document exploited a newer vulnerability, CVE-**\n\n**2017-0199. Group 123 used this vulnerability less than one month after its public disclosure.**\n\n**During this campaign, the attackers used 2 different malicious binaries: PoohMilk and Freenki.**\n\n**PoohMilk exists only to launch Freenki. Freenki is used to gather information about the**\n\n**infected system and to download a subsequent stage payload. This malware was used in**\n\n**several campaigns in 2016 and has some code overlap with ROKRAT.**\n\n**Finally, we identified a 6th campaign that is also linked to Group 123. We named this 6th�**\n\n**campaign \"Are You Happy?\". In this campaign, the attackers deployed a disk wiper. The**\n\n**purpose of this attack was not only to gain access to the remote infected systems but to also**\n\n**wipe the first sectors of the device. We identified that the wiper is a ROKRAT module.�**\n\n**This actor was very active this year and continued to mainly focus on South Korea. The group**\n\n**leveraged spear phishing campaigns and malicious documents the contents of which included**\n\n**very specific language suggesting that they were crafted by native Korean speakers rather than�**\n\n**through the use of translation services. The actor has the following demonstrated capabilities:**\n\n**To include exploits (for Hangul and Microsoft Office) in its workflows.�**\n\n**To modify its campaigns by splitting the payload in to multiple stages**\n\n**To use compromised web servers or legitimate cloud based platforms.**\n\n**To use HTTPS communications to make it harder to perform traffic analysis.�**\n\n**To compromise third parties to forge realistic spear phishing campaigns (i e Yonsei**\n\n\n-----\n\n### T H E T I M E L I N E\n\n**Here is the timeline for 2017 and the beginning of 2018:**\n\n### A U G U S T 2 0 1 6 T O M C A M P A I G N\n\n**As with the majority of Group 123 campaigns, the initial attack vector during this campaign was**\n\n**spear phishing. Talos identified two different kinds of emails. The first email we discovered was�**\n\n**the most interesting. In this sample, we observed the attackers praising the user for joining a**\n\n**panel related to the \"Korean Reunification and North Korean Conference\". The text in the email�**\n\n**explained that the recipient should complete the attached document to provide necessary**\n\n**feedback. This appears to be a non-existent conference. The closest match we identified�**\n\n**related to any Unification conference was held in January 2017, which was the NYDA�**\n\n**Reunification conference. The sender was '�kgf2016@yonsei.ac.kr' which is the contact email of**\n\n**the Korea Global Forum, a separate conference.**\n\n**When we analyzed the email headers, we determined that the email was sent from an SMTP**\n\n**server using an IP associated with the Yonsei University network. We believe that the email**\n\n**address was compromised and abused by the attackers to send the email used in this**\n\n**campaign.**\n\n**The filename for the malicious attachment translates as 'Unification North Korea Conference _�**\n\n**Examination Documents' which reinforces the text in the email about the reunification�**\n\n**conference. For an added bonus, in the body of the email, the attacker even suggests that**\n\n**people who completed the document would get paid a 'small fee'. Perhaps the gift of**\n\n**embedded malware is the payment:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Much less effort was used to craft the second email Talos analyzed. The email was from a free**\n\n**Korean mail service provided by Daum, Hanmail, indicating that there was no attempt to try to**\n\n**appear as if it originated from an official body or person, unlike the previous email described.�**\n\n**The subject was simply 'Request Help' while the attachment filename was 'I'm a munchon�**\n\n**person in Gangwon-do, North Korea'. We suspect the attacker was trying to generate**\n\n**sympathy by reminding the reader that Munchon and the province it is in, Kangwon, were part**\n\n**of a unified province that included South Korea's Gangwon-do prior to the division of Korea in�**\n\n**1945.**\n\n**A second email contained a story about a person called 'Ewing Kim' who was looking for help:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The email's attachments are two different HWP documents, both leveraging same vulnerability**\n\n**(CVE-2013-0808). This vulnerability targets the EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) format. The**\n\n**purpose of the shellcode is to download a payload from the Internet. The first email displays�**\n\n**the following decoy document to the infected user and download the following payload:**\n\n**hxxp://discgolfglow[.]com:/wp-content/plugins/maintenance/images/worker.jpg**\n\n**The second email displays the following decoy document to the infected user and downloads**\n\n\n-----\n\n**hxxp://acddesigns[.]com[.]au/clients/ACPRCM/kingstone.jpg**\n\n**In both cases, the downloaded payload is the ROKRAT malware.**\n\n**The first tasks of this variant of ROKRAT is to check the operating system version. If Windows�**\n\n**XP is detected, the malware executes an infinite loop. The purpose is to generate empty�**\n\n**reports if opened on sandbox systems running Windows XP machines. Additionally it checks to**\n\n**determine if common analysis tools are currently running on the infected system. If it detects**\n\n**the presence of these tools, the malware performs two network requests to legitimate**\n\n**websites:**\n\n**hxxps://www[.]amazon[.]com/Men-War-**\n**PC/dp/B001QZGVEC/EsoftTeam/watchcom.jpg**\n\n**hxxp://www[.]hulu[.]com/watch/559035/episode3.mp4**\n\n**The Amazon URL displays a WWII game called 'Men of War' while the Hulu URL attempts to**\n\n**stream a Japanese anime show called 'Golden Time':**\n\n\n-----\n\n**One of the identifying characteristics of ROKRAT is the fact that it uses social network and**\n\n**cloud platforms to communicate with the attackers. These platforms are used to exfiltrate�**\n\n**documents and receive instructions. Here is a list of the platforms used by this variant: Twitter,**\n\n**Yandex and Mediafire. The tokens for each platform are hardcoded within the sample:�**\n\n\n-----\n\n### C A M P A I G N\n\n**In the early part of 2017, Group123 started the \"Evil New Year\" campaign. In this campaign the**\n\n**actors tried to fool victims by pretending the emails were from the Korean Ministry of**\n\n**Unification and that they offered Korean-specific analysis. �This campaign began with a handful**\n\n**of spear phishing emails to South Korean targets and containing malicious attachments.**\n\n**Group123 further attempted to entice victims to open the attachments by using common**\n\n**Hancom Hangul documents. Hancom's Hangul is a popular Office Suite used primarily in the�**\n\n**Korean peninsula. The use of Hangul office documents has the advantage of being the norm�**\n\n**for the Korean peninsula. If the attacker used Microsoft documents, it may have raised**\n\n**suspicions in the victim. Given the regional file format used there is a chance that some�**\n\n**security software suites may not handle them well, and this may have provided an evasion**\n\n**case for the attacker.**\n\n**The documents sent to the targets were titled \"Analysis of \"Northern New Year in 2017\" and**\n\n**used the official logo of the Korean Ministry of Unification. This is a simple choice for the actor�**\n\n**to make, but it further shows their familiarity with the region.**\n\n**The document claimed to discuss the New Year's activities of North Korea and this would have**\n\n**been something that the victims in South Korea would be very interested in. This would have**\n\n\n-----\n\n**This document was a decoy aimed to entice the user to open malicious documents embedded**\n\n**further down the page**\n\n**The actor embedded two additional links and the document urged the user to click on these**\n\n**links for more information about New Year's activities in North Korea. The first link was labeled�**\n\n**as \"Comparison of Major Tasks in '16 & '17\" and the second link was identified as \"Comparison�**\n\n**between '16 & '17\".**\n\n**Upon opening these links the user was presented with a further decoy Hangul document. This**\n\n**document was well written and further increases our confidence that we are dealing with a new�**\n\n**Korean actor. These documents contained malicious OLE objects used to drop binaries.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**This time, however, they contained malicious OLE (Object Link Embedded) objects.**\n\n**Initial analysis confirmed two similarly sized OLE object files within this document which�**\n\n**appeared to be the same from an execution point of view.**\n\n**The two dropped binaries were stored and executed in this location during our analysis:**\n\n**C:\\Users\\ADMINI~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Hwp (2).exe**\n\n**C:\\Users\\ADMINI~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Hwp (3).exe**\n\n**Initial analysis showed some sloppy cleaning up from Group123, which we used later to**\n\n**determine that separate campaigns were the work of this same actor, as compilation artifacts**\n\n**remained within the binaries:**\n\n**e:\\Happy\\Work\\Source\\version 12\\T+M\\Result\\DocPrint.pdb**\n\n**The second stage of the dropped binaries was used to execute wscript.exe while injecting**\n\n**shellcode into this process. The shellcode is embedded within the resource 'BIN' and is used to**\n\n**unpack another PE32 binary and use wscript.exe to execute it. To do this, Group123 uses a**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The new PE32 unpacked from the shellcode is an initial reconnaissance malware which is**\n\n**used to communicate with the C2 infrastructure to obtain the final payload. The information this�**\n\n**malware collected included the following:**\n\n**The computer name**\n\n**The username**\n\n**The execution path of the sample**\n\n**The BIOS model**\n\n**A randomly-generated ID to uniquely identify the system**\n\n**Group123 utilized this method to ensure their victim was (a) someone they wanted to target**\n\n**further and (b) someone they could infect further based on the information obtained from the**\n\n**reconnaissance phase.**\n\n**Further network analysis showed that the binary attempted to connect to the following URLs:**\n\n**www[.]kgls[.]or[.]kr/news2/news_dir/index.php**\n\n**www[.]kgls[.]or[.]kr/news2/news_dir/02BC6B26_put.jpg**\n\n**Korean Government Legal Services (KGLS) is a legitimate Korean government body that**\n\n**manages Korean government legal affairs. By compromising the KGLS, the attacker gained a**\n\n**trusted platform from which to execute an attack.**\n\n**The initial network connection is to 'index.php'. This connection transmits the information**\n\n**gathered during the reconnaissance phase. The attacker uses this information to then**\n\n**determine the specific filename (based on the random ID) to serve to the infected victim. In our�**\n\n**case this was 02BC6B26 - this meant a file \"02BC6B26_put.jpg\" was created for us on the�**\n\n**attackers C2. This file is then dropped and renamed 'officepatch.exe' on the victim's machine.�**\n\n**Because the attacker was careful about who they attacked, we were unable to obtain this file�**\n\n**during our analysis.**\n\n**During our investigation we were able to identify additional Command and Control**\n\n**infrastructure used by this actor. Four C2s were observed, based in the following countries:**\n\n**3 C2 in South Korea**\n\n**1 C2 in the Netherlands**\n\n**Here is a global map of the identified infrastructure:�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Contrary to the previous campaign, the attackers separated the reconnaissance phase from**\n\n**the main ROKRAT payload. This trick was likely used to avoid detection. This is an interesting**\n\n**adaptation in Group 123's behavior.**\n\n### M A R C H 2 0 1 7 : \" A R E\n\n**In March 2017, Group 123 compiled a disk wiper. The malware contains 1 function, the**\n\n**purpose is to open the drive of the infected system (\\\\.\\PhysicalDrive0) and write the following**\n\n**data to the MBR:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**malware reboots the machine with the following command: c:\\windows\\system32\\shutdown /r /t**\n\n**1**\n\n**After the reboot, the MBR displays the following string to the user:**\n\n**The link to the other campaigns was the following PDB path:**\n\n**D:\\HighSchool\\version**\n**13\\VC2008(Version15)\\T+M\\T+M\\TMProject\\Release\\ErasePartition.pdb**\n\n**As you can see, it perfectly matches the ROKRAT PDB. This wiper is a ROKRAT module**\n\n**named ERSP.enc. We assume that ERSP means ERaSePartition. This module can be**\n\n**downloaded and executed on demand by Group 123.**\n\n**This sample is interesting considering the attack in December 2014 against a Korean power**\n\n**plant where the message that was displayed by the wiper was \"Who Am I?\".**\n\n### M A Y 2 0 1 7 : \" F R E E M\n\n**This campaign targeted non-Korean financial institutions, but unlike the other campaigns, this�**\n\n**one does not use HWP documents. It instead uses Office documents. This change is because�**\n\n**Group 123 did not target South Korea during this campaign and Microsoft Office is standard in�**\n\n**the rest of the world.**\n\n### Infection Vectors\n\n**The attackers exploited CVE-2017-0199 in order to download and execute a malicious HTA**\n\n**document inside of Microsoft Office.

Group 123 again used one**\n\n**of their main calling cards, the malicious HWP document. This time, Group 123 used a**\n\n**document containing information in relation to a meeting held on 1st November in Seoul, South**\n\n**Korea. This document was alleged to have been written by a legal representative claiming to**\n\n**be representing the \"Citizens' Alliance For North Korean Human Rights And Reunification Of�**\n\n**Korean Peninsula\". Group 123 once again uses information related to the Korean unification�**\n\n**and now are claiming to highlight concerns related to human rights issues.**\n\n**The document brought Talos a new gift - a new version of ROKRAT. Following on with the**\n\n**normal Group 123 activity the document was written in perfect Korean text and dialect again**\n\n**suggesting the origin of this group is from the Korean peninsula.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Further analysis of the document text allowed us to understand the context. The document**\n\n**mentions 'Community of North Korean human rights and unification' with the lawyer claiming to�**\n\n**be part of the \"Citizen's Alliance for North Korean Human Rights and North-South unification\".�**\n\n**The main purpose of this document was an attempt to arrange a meeting to discuss items**\n\n**related to \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" and \"Enactment of a Law\" which was passed in**\n\n**2016 in South Korea. We believe that the document was attempting to target stakeholders**\n\n**within the '올인통' community in an attempt to entice them to join the discussion in an attempt to**\n\n**work on additional ideas related to these activities. The meeting was due to take place on**\n\n**November 1, 2017 and this document was trying to garner additional interest prior to the**\n\n**meeting.**\n\n**Once again Group 123 leveraged the use of OLE objects within the HWP document.

Talos suspect the filename may have been�**\n\n**selected to make it appear within running processes as a potential Hancom updater.**\n\n**The dropper is used to extract a new resource named SBS. This specific resource contains�**\n\n**malicious shellcode used by the malware. Additionally we see a cmd.exe process launched**\n\n**and used for process injection using the VirtualAlloc(), WriteProcessMemory() and**\n\n**CreateRemoteThread() Windows APIs, as with the first finding of ROKRAT they continue to�**\n\n**use similar Windows APIs. The following graph view from IDA shows these steps.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**These execution steps allow the launch of the new ROKRAT variant by decoding the PE binary**\n\n**and injecting into the cmd.exe process.**\n\n**One of Group 123 oddities in this campaign was to drop the following picture as a decoy image**\n\n**to the user. This image shows various publicly available images which look to be related to the**\n\n**Korean 'Independence Movement' and appear to be related to the Korean war.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**We began performing further in-depth analysis on this new version of ROKRAT and this is**\n\n**where we started to notice some similarities with Group 123s \"Evil New Years\" campaign. The**\n\n**similitudes are discussed later in this paper.**\n\n**This ROKRAT variant contained anti-sandbox techniques. This is performed by checking if the**\n\n**following libraries are loaded on the victim machine.**\n\n**SbieDll.dll (sandboxie library)**\n\n**Dbghelp.dll (Microsoft debugging tools)**\n\n**Api_log.dll (threatAnalyzer / GFI SandBox)**\n\n**Dir_watch.dll (threatAnalyzer / GFI SandBox)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**analysis difficult, Group 123 used an anti-debugging technique related to NOP (No Operation).�**\n\n**nop dword ptr [eax+eax+00h] is a 5 byte NOP. But this opcode is not correctly supported by**\n\n**some debugging tools, Immunity Debugger for example, will replace the assembly by \"???\" in**\n\n**red making it difficult to attempt to debug.�**\n\n**This version of ROKRAT came with a Browser Stealer mechanism which was similar, with a**\n\n**few modifications, to that used in the FreeMilk campaign using Freenki malware in 2016.�**\n\n**Group 123 continued their use of Cloud platforms with this campaign, this time leveraging**\n\n**pCloud, Dropbox, Box and Yandex.**\n\n**Finally here is the PDB of the sample used during this campaign:**\n\n**d:\\HighSchool\\version 13\\2ndBD\\T+M\\T+M\\Result\\DocPrint.pdb**\n\n### J A N U A R Y 2 0 1 8 : \" E\n\n**As we observed at the beginning of 2017, Group 123 started a campaign corresponding with**\n\n**the new year in 2018. This campaign started on the 2nd of January. The infection vector was a**\n\n\n-----\n\n**This decoy document is an analysis of the 2018 New Year speech made by the leader of North**\n\n**Korea. The approach is exactly the same as what was seen in 2017 using a new decoy**\n\n**document. This document was alleged to have been written by the Ministry of Reunification as�**\n\n**demonstrated by the logo in the top left.**\n\n**Similar to the \"Golden Time\" campaign, this document exploits an EPS vulnerability in order to**\n\n**download and execute shellcode located on a compromised website:**\n\n**hxxp://60chicken[.]co[.]kr/wysiwyg/PEG_temp/logo1.png**\n\n**The fake image usage is a common pattern for this group. This image contains shellcode used**\n\n**to decode the embedded final payload: ROKRAT. This ROKRAT variant is loaded from�**\n\n**memory. It's a fileless version of ROKRAT. This behavior shows that Group 123 is constantly�**\n\n**evolving to avoid detection. As usual, the ROKRAT sample uses cloud providers to**\n\n**communicate with the operator, this time leveraging Yandex, pCloud, Dropbox and Box.**\n\n### L I N K S B E T W E E N C A\n\n Code Sharing\n\n\n-----\n\n**are shared in the samples mentioned in this article; however we will cover only two in this**\n\n**article: the reconnaissance phase and the browsers stealer.**\n\n**RECONNAISSANCE PHASE**\n\n**The ROKRAT samples used during the two \"Evil New Year\" and the \"North Korean Human**\n\n**Rights\" campaigns contained a reconnaissance phase. In the \"Evil New Year\" campaign the**\n\n**payload was split into two parts, the first part contained the reconnaissance code. In the other�**\n\n**campaign the reconnaissance phase was directly included in the main payload. This code is**\n\n**the same.**\n\n**The malware uses the following registry key to get the machine type:**\n\n**HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\mssmbios\\Data\\SMBiosData. The \"System**\n\n**manufacturer\" value is used to identify the type of machine. The code appears to be based on**\n\n**a forum post (rohitab.com) describing the use of the Win32 APIs used. The source code only**\n\n**considers the following machine types:**\n\n\n**default:  lpString = \"(Other)\";        break;**\n\n**case 0x02: lpString = \"(Unknown)\";       break;**\n\n**case 0x03: lpString = \"(Desktop)\";       break;**\n\n**case 0x04: lpString = \"(Low Profile Desktop)\"; break;�**\n\n**case 0x06: lpString = \"(Mini Tower)\";     break;**\n\n**case 0x07: lpString = \"(Tower)\";        break;**\n\n**case 0x08: lpString = \"(Portable)\";      break;**\n\n**case 0x09: lpString = \"(Laptop)\";       break;**\n\n**case 0x0A: lpString = \"(Notebook)\";      break;**\n\n**case 0x0E: lpString = \"(Sub Notebook)\";    break;**\n\n\n**The string format - with the () - and the considering types are exactly the same as those used**\n\n**in the ROKRAT samples.**\n\n**It's interesting to note that this reconnaissance phase was not included in the ROKRAT variant**\n\n**used during the \"Golden Time\" campaign.**\n\n**BROWER STEALER**\n\n**For the first time, the ROKRAT sample used during the \"North Korean Human Rights\"�**\n\n**contained a browser credentials stealer. The code used to perform this task in the same that**\n\n**found within in a Freenki sample deployed in 2016.**\n\n**The malware is able to extract the stored passwords from Internet Explorer, Chrome and**\n\n**Firefox For Chrome and Firefox the malware queries the sqlite database containing the URL**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Additionally, they support the Microsoft Vault mechanism. Vault was implemented in Windows**\n\n**7, it contains any sensitive data (like the credentials) of Internet Explorer. Here is the**\n\n**initialization of the Vault APIs:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**On the left, we have the ROKRAT sample and on the right the FreeMilk sample. You can see**\n\n**that in addition to the code, the author copy-pasted English typos such as \"IE Registery\":**\n\n### PDB Paths\n\n**We can clearly identify a pattern in the PDB naming convention of all the binaries mentioned in**\n\n**this article.**\n\n**ROKRAT:**\n\n**e:\\Happy\\Work\\Source\\version 12\\T+M\\Result\\DocPrint.pdb (from the \"Evil New**\n**Year\" campaign)**\n\n**d:\\HighSchool\\version 13\\2ndBD\\T+M\\T+M\\Result\\DocPrint.pdb (from the \"North**\n**Korean Human Rights\" campaign**\n\n**D:\\HighSchool\\version 13\\First-Dragon(VS2015)\\Sample\\Release\\DogCall.pdb**\n**(ROKRAT Sample from an unidentified campaign from June)�**\n\n**Wiper:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**13\\VC2008(Version15)\\T+M\\T+M\\TMProject\\Release\\ErasePartition.pdb (From the**\n**\"Are You Happy?\" campaign)**\n\n### S U M M A R Y G R A P H\n\n**Here is a graph to visualize the similarities and differences between each campaign mentioned**\n\n**in this article:**\n\n### C O N C L U S I O N\n\n**South Korea is becoming an important target for malicious actors and the techniques used are**\n\n**becoming specific to the region (for example: use of native language to try and ensure the�**\n\n**targets feel that the information, document or email being sent to them has added legitimacy).**\n\n**In a specific campaign, this actor took time to compromise multiple legitimate Korean platforms�**\n\n**including Yonsei and the KGLS in order to forge the spear phishing campaign or to host the**\n\n**command and control. This approach is not common with less advanced actors and**\n\n**demonstrates a high level of maturity and knowledge of the Korean region.**\n\n**However Group 123's activities are not limited to South Korea. For international targets, they**\n\n**are able to switch to a more standard attack vector such as using Microsoft Office documents�**\n\n**as opposed to the specific HWP documents used when targeting victims located in Korea.�**\n\n**Group 123 does not hesitate to use public exploits and scripting languages to drop and**\n\n**execute malicious payloads. We can notice that this group uses compromised legitimate**\n\n**websites (mainly Wordpress) and cloud platforms to communicate with the infected systems.**\n\n**This approach makes it difficult to detect communications through analysis of these network�**\n\n**flows. Even if the arsenal of this actor is diverse, we have identified some patterns, copy-paste�**\n\n**code from various public repositories and similarities between the different piece of code. In**\n\n**addition to the Remote Administration Tools, we identified a wiper. We conclude that this group�**\n\n**was involved in a campaign of intelligence gathering and finally attempted destruction.�**\n\n**With our current knowledge of this actor, we predict that they will not disappear anytime soon**\n\n**and will continue to be active during the coming years. Group 123 is constantly evolving as the**\n\n\n-----\n\n**explained their capabilities will likely continue to evolve over time as they further refine their�**\n\n**TTPs.**\n\n### I O C S\n\n \"Golden
