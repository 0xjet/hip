The recent breach at EA—leveraging the game company’s Slack communications through stolen credentials to infiltrate the](https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kvkqb/how-ea-games-was-hacked-slack)\ncompany network—is an example of the threat information stealing malware can pose to businesses as well as individuals.\n\nRecently, we’ve been tracking a particularly active campaign by actors using Raccoon Stealer, a widely-used information stealing malware.\nWhile Raccoon has been in the wild for some time, and is run as a service by its developers for other criminals, this recent campaign has\nmade up the majority of our recent detections of the malware. As such, it offers an opportunity to examine the evolving tactics, techniques and\nprocedures used by criminals to steal critical information—either for sale in criminal marketplaces, or for their own use.\n\n\n-----\n\nA post introducing Raccoon Stealer on a Russian\nlanguage forum (translated).\nLike many stealers, Raccoon Stealer is sold as a service, rather than as a standalone malware. Its developers have been marketing the\nstealer-as-a-service platform for (at least) the last two years on the dark web on malware-related forums. Controlled from a Tor-based\ncommand and control “panel” server, Raccoon is much like other commercial web-based services in that it is under perpetual development,\nwith new features and bug fixes shipping regularly—even providing automated updates to malware that’s already deployed on infected\nmachines. While sold on boards that are predominantly in Russian, Raccoon also advertises in English and offers English-language support.\n\nRaccoon can collect passwords, cookies, and the “autofill” text for websites, including credit card data and other personal identifying\ninformation that may be stored by the browser. Thanks to a recent “clipper” update, Raccoon Stealer also now targets cryptocurrency wallets,\nand can retrieve or drop files on infected systems.\n\nAn advertisement post for the latest upgrades to\n\nRaccoon… …and the translation of the post.\n\nThe developers of Raccoon keep tight control on the access to their malware, hosting access to any bots that are deployed by their customers\nthrough a Tor-based web panel. Each executable of their malware has a signature tied to the customer—so that if a sample of their malware\nshows up on VirusTotal or other malware sites, they can trace it back to the customer who may have leaked it.\n\n## The infostealer ecosystem\n\nInformation stealers fill an important niche in the cybercrime ecosystem. They are a component of all sorts of identity theft, allowing their\noperators to harvest personal identifying information from the systems they infect—including the theft of login data in the form of stored\ncredentials and browser cookies that control access to web-based services. These credentials are often swiped and sold on criminal\nmarketplaces, allowing other actors to take advantage of them for their own criminal intentions.\n\nInfostealers are an inexpensive entry ramp into criminal activity. An entry-level, seven day subscription to Raccoon Stealer, for example, only\ncosts $75. And unlike more sophisticated criminal malware operations (such as ransomware), there’s no vetting of buyers—they can be\npurchased by anyone, regardless of their reputation in the criminal underworld. Services such as Raccoon permit nascent cybercriminals to\nestablish a reputation that would let them subscribe to, or purchase, more advanced malware from more exclusive vendors.\n\nOn top of that, some infostealers’ binaries and source code are freely obtainable. A “cracked” version of the Azorult infostealer builder is\nposted on several download sites that can be found with a quick web search. There are also offensive security tools, such as LaZagne, that\n[can be used for the same task by malicious actors—we’ve seen LaZagne used by Dharma ransomware operators.](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/08/12/color-by-numbers-inside-a-dharma-ransomware-as-a-service-attack/)\n\n\n-----\n\necause o t s easy a a ab ty, o at o stea e s a e a p e a e t t eat ou te e et y, a d a e ope ated by a de s at o acto s s\nis in part because of how easy it is for would-be criminals to obtain them and deploy infostealers, and because the thriving marketplace for\nstolen credentials and service access makes it easy to turn a quick profit on their fruit.\n\nOnce deployed, the criminals buying, renting (or stealing) infostealers easily find a market for the stolen data. There is a constant demand for\nstolen user credentials—especially credentials providing access to legitimate services that can be used to host or spread more malware, either\nthrough hosting (with FTP or other server credentials) or distribution (with email or messaging apps)–gaining the benefit of the legitimacy of the\nstolen domains and accounts. This makes infostealer data grabs easy and low-risk to monetize, compared to deeper network intrusions,\nransomware or fraudulent use of web banking services.\n\nNot all infostealers are used in this way. Some serve as a component of another threat—for example, as part of an attempt to move laterally\nwithin a network by a ransomware operator (as in the case of Dharma actors’ use of LaZagne). Some are used in targeted ways, to get access\nto a specific organization for the purpose of deploying other malware. In some cases, infostealers are built into another form of malware, such\n[as remote access tools. QuasarRAT, for example, does not execute its information stealing components until it receives a remote command](https://github.com/quasar/Quasar)\nfrom its human operator.\n\n## Trash panda compromise\n\nIn targeted intrusions where the infostealer tool is just part of a larger intrusion, attackers deploy the infostealer manually, after gaining access\nthrough other means. But more often, infostealers such as Raccoon are distributed in one of two ways.\n\nThe most frequent method is via spam email, as a compressed executable or as the payload of a malicious document dropper. But attackers\nmay also spread the malware using a malicious website, or peer-to-peer sharing service (such as Bittorrent), masquerading as pirated\nsoftware. Again, the stealer itself may get delivered, or it may be installed by a dropper.\n\nThe vast majority of recent Raccoon samples are distributed via a single dropper campaign leveraging malicious websites. The actors behind\nthe campaign also used search engine optimization to raise the chances that people looking for a particular software package would visit the\nmalicious sites. Search for “[software product name] crack” on Google return links to websites that purport to provide downloads of software\nwith license requirements bypassed.\n\nA Google search for a cracked version of a software\n\npackage returns links to pirated software sites—except (at least) one of these is a malware site.\nThe sites associated with the campaign have been search-engine optimized to be high in the results for Google and other web searches for\ncracked software. They are also promoted on a YouTube channel with videos about ‘warez’ (pirated software). We found samples in telemetry\nrooted with two domains: gsmcracktools.blogspot.com and procrackerz.org.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe fake\n\nwarez site, a WordPress blog, is filled with listings for “cracked” software.\nWhile the sites advertised themselves as a repository of “cracked” legitimate software packages, the files delivered were actually disguised\ndroppers. Clicking on the links to a download connected to a set of redirector JavaScripts hosted on Amazon Web Services that shunt victims\nto one of multiple download locations, delivering different versions of the dropper.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe downloaded first-stage payload is an archive,\n\ncontaining a password-protected archive and a text document containing a password.\n\nThe archive containing the “setup” executable is password-protected to evade\n\nmalware scanning. The contents of the password\n\nfile, complete with ASCII art.\nThe payloads within these password-protected folders are self-extracting installers. They have signatures associated with self-extracting\narchives from tools such as 7zip or Winzip SFX, but cannot be unpacked by these tools. Either the signatures have been faked, or the headers\nof the files have been manipulated by the actors behind the droppers to prevent unpacking without execution.\n\n\n-----\n\ne d oppe s t s ca pa g d d ot o y ca y accoo t ey de e a u be o ot e a a e a es, so et es t e sa e bu d e,\nincluding:\n\ncrypto-miners\n“clippers” (malware which steal cryptocurrencies by modifying the victim’s system clipboard during transactions and changing the\ndestination wallet)\nmalicious browser extensions\nYouTube click-fraud bots\nDjvu/Stop (a ransomware targeted primarily at home users).\n\nThe variety of malware suggests these droppers are most likely “droppers as a service” and not directly related to the threat actor using\nRaccoon Stealer. We’ll explore this campaign in more detail in an upcoming report.\n\n## Telegram from home\n\nThe samples of Raccoon dropped by this campaign are distinct from previously analyzed samples in that these use Telegram channels for\ncommunication. Telegram is used to deliver the address of a command and control gateway.\n\nA Google cache of a Raccoon Telegram channel preview.\n\nA live view of the channel preview, with a different encrypted channel description message. This channel address is encrypted and hard-coded\ninto the Raccoon stealer, along with a configuration ID associated with the Raccoon “customer” and an RC4 encryption key.\n\n\n-----\n\nRaccoon code for contacting Telegram and\n\nacquiring the gate address.\nUsing the hard-coded RC4 key, Raccoon decrypts the message in the description for the channel—which contains the address for a command\nand control “gate.” This is not a straightforward decryption process—a portion of the resulting string is trimmed from both the start and end of\nthe channel description, and then the code decrypts the text with RC4 to obtain the C2 gate address.\n\nThis mechanism can be used to change between gates if communications are blocked. With the gate address retrieved, Raccoon connects to\nthe gate to communicate with the C2.\n\nRaccoon C2 traffic summary, starting with the\n\nTelegram connection. Upload from Raccoon to the\n\nC2 “gate”.\nThe first HTTP POST sent by Raccoon to the gate includes a base64-encoded “params” field. This includes a unique identifier for the stealer\nbot (bot_id) and the configuration ID decrypted earlier. The C2 gate responds with a JSON object that contains configuration information for the\nstealer.\n\n\n-----\n\nRaccoon Stealer configuration data passed down by\n\nthe C2 includes location data about the target.\nThe configuration contains links to retrieve required library files of Raccoon stealer (and, in some cases, for additional payloads). In the sample\nwe analyzed, the secondary payload is a cryptocurrency miner.\n\n## Trash panda-ing through your info\n\nAfter collecting data from the victim machine, Raccoon archives them into a bundle to upload to the C2. The archive contains a screenshot of\nthe victim’s desktop (screen.jpg), gathered system information (System Info.txt), and stolen data from browsers, email clients, cryptocurrency\nwallets—whatever data it can find based on\n\nSystem Info.txt follows the format below:\n\n\n-----\n\nAn example of the content of System Info.txt sent\n\nback by Raccoon Stealer.\nOnce collected, the archive is uploaded to the gate as an HTTP post.\n\n## Working in the coin mine\n\nFrom the network telemetry summarized earlier, we saw our Raccoon Stealer sample download two additional payloads. The first is a\ncryptocurrency mining tool, installed by a loader Raccoon downloaded in this sample from f0473248.xsph.ru/ApplicationFrameHost.exe.\n\n[The code itself is based on SilentXMRMiner, written in Visual Basic .NET:](https://github.com/UnamSanctam/SilentXMRMiner)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe SilentXMRMiner Github page advertises its\n\ndefense evasion and persistence capabilities.\nThe miner is built with a configuration that allows the attacker to determine the type of cryptocurrency it mines, the mining pool it connects to,\nand a wallet address, through a graphic interface. The resulting miner configuration is packaged for delivery as a payload. Raccoon allows its\nsubscribers to deploy such payloads through its Tor-based web interface.\n\nScreen shots of the configuration builder for\n\nSilentXMRMiner\n\n\n-----\n\nThe miner’s .NET code is obfuscated with Crypto\n\n[Obfuscator based on analysis with de4dot. It behaves in the following way:](https://github.com/de4dot/de4dot)\n\n1. Checks running processes; if another copy of the miner is already running, it terminates execution.\n2. Copies itself to %TEMP%\\RtkAudUService64.exe.\n3. Adds a “HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” registry key for persistence.\n4. Executes %TEMP%\\RtkAudUService64.exe\n5. The new instance runs a legitimate version of the File Explorer executable (explorer.exe), and injects the miner code into that process via\n\na RunPE method—replacing the code in the explorer.exe memory with the miner code.\n\nThe execution flow of the Raccoon sample.\n\nThe code block that performs the RunPE “process\n\nhollowing.”\nThe configuration of the miner is passed to the hollowed process by the loader as parameters (shown as the “explorer.exe” process at the top\nleft of the process flow chart above). The configuration parameter includes the type of coin to mine and the URL of the mining pool to connect\nto, and other settings configured by the miner builder:\n\n\n-----\n\nfor XMR. The first paid out 10.04 XMR over its lifetime:\n\napproximately $2,900 US over the roughly eight-month lifetime of the wallets.\n\n## Clipping cryptocoins\n\n\nWe found two wallets used by the campaign, both\n\nThe second paid out 4 XMR.\n\nBetween the two of them, that amounts to\n\n\nThe miner clearly wasn’t the only second-stage payload delivered from the Raccoon Stealer source domain used in this campaign\n(f0473248.xsph.ru). VirusTotal recorded that this domain delivered 18 payloads between October 2020 and April 2021—the period during\nwhich most of this investigation took place, and the campaign was active.\n\nWhile many were variants of the miner we evaluated above, the other payloads delivered a “clipper” malware called QuilClipper. This\n[information stealer malware hijacks cryptocurrency and (in this case) Steam trade transactions, steering them to the malware’s operator.](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6748-ETSG-5417#howtotrade)\n\nThe initial payload delivered from Raccoon is a loader, written in .NET, heavily obfuscated and packed. Static analysis on the unpacked sample\nrevealed that the loader contains 3 main components: an encrypted payload, an anti-virtual machine module to evade analysis, and a RunPE\nmodule to do the same sort of process-hollowing that Raccoon Stealer itself uses to execute.\n\nThe RunPE module used to load the clipper malware into memory can select from five different executables to run and replace with the\nmalware code. The encrypted payload of the loader is QuilClipper itself.\n\nA compiled AutoIT executable, QuilClipper has been in active use since 2018. First published on darkwebs.ws (which is currently down), the\nclipper malware’s source code was leaked on underground forums. While the original author of QuilClipper was a Russian speaker who uses\nthe nickname “nzx” on forums and in code, this sample of QuilClipper included different author nickname: MickeyMF.\n\n\n-----\n\nQu C ppe stea s c yptocu e cy a d Stea t a sact o s by co t uous y o to g t e syste c pboa d o do s de ces t ects,\nwatching for cryptocurrency wallet addresses and Steam trade offers by running clipboard contents through a matrix of regular expressions to\nidentify them:\n\n**RegEx** **Currency**\n\n79[0-9]{9} qiwiru\n\n380[0-9]{9} qiwiua\n\n375[0-9]{9} qiwibe\n\n(?i)E[0-9]{12} wme\n\n(?i)Z[0-9]{12} wmz\n\n(?i)X[0-9]{12} wmx\n\n4100[0-9]{10,12} ya\n\nP[0-9]{9,11} pa\n\n(?i)(steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/[?]partner=[0-9]{9}&token=[0-9A-z]{8}) steam\n\n(1)[1-9A-Z][1-9A-z]{32} btc\n\n(3)[1-9A-Z][1-9A-z]{32} btc2\n\n(G)[A-z][1-9A-z]{32} btg\n\n(A)[A-z][1-9A-z]{32} btg2\n\nD[A-Z1-9][1-9A-z]{32} doge\n\nX[a-z][1-9A-z]{32} dash\n\n(L)[A-z][1-9A-z]{32} lite\n\n(M)[A-z][1-9A-z]{32} lite2\n\nt[0-9A-z]{33,35} zcash\n\n0x[0-9A-z]{40} eth\n\nq[a-z0-9]{41} bch\n\n4[1-9A-z]{94,105} xmr\n\n2[1-9A-z]{94,105} bcn\n\nR[1-9a-z][1-9A-z]{32} rdd\n\nG[1-9][1-9A-z]{93} grft\n\nB[1-9a-z][1-9A-z]{32} blk\n\nE[A-z][1-9A-z]{32} emc\n\nr[A-Z][1-9A-z]{32} xrp\n\nN[A-Z][1-9A-z]{32} neo\n\n[A-Z9]{90} iota\n\nDdzFFzCqrht[1-9A-z]{93} ada\n\n[0-9]{20}L lsk\n\nS[A-z][1-9A-z]{32} strat\n\n3P[1-9A-z]{33} waves\n\nQ[A-z][1-9A-z]{32} qtum\n\nV[a-z][A-z][1-9A-z]{31} via\n\nWe were able to extract the complete list of cryptocurrency wallets used in this QuilClipper campaign:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Currency** **Address**\n\nwme E131861246090\n\nwmz Z951343623712\n\nwmx X295432170648\n\neth 0x51923d87c096dfEF7962b97A9c315e147302e1e9\n\nbtc 1BgivXvAHYsY82TaGkQ9znVrsm8Ka4SYic\n\nbtc2 3No6411JCoFJ1YKbNx3XEfiSTfJG66kzuP\n\nbch qrycev0vycz7k58f9xspmhpnp7hh5wtz7qf6k99r5q\n\nbtg GRAUWErUbiGz1nFJtM8RTb4vKuojKBpggD\n\nbtg2 AYqLnTTThKqhV4npsciGstSpAa1XdkrrBP\n\ndoge D7PxzNxHpHWXUDZFD87oz26xdwzA2ZPHCH\n\ndash Xvhy5ivBRSD2EV5iWMJQcNHzZfsFHzmGx9\n\nlite LPrTY2BMuhRufywiYmJWRQrRxaM29uWK5S\n\nlite2 MS8fsusNAxGm7pWV4VXD3mGzDf5ryEccW8\n\nxmr 4GpZCMCXCDC7UZmYPezXCW4n9UbRmpngrNT6XAx4UtUka8fGUvJu557bTqQnYLFDXsR6q8Ebw35rR7hqfmEgTHj5Pq5kkhwfbY\n\nzcash t1JRpfow927XUoPtmgataMC5m5aLewzNYUP\n\nblk BLX4ZNU8hKPuTvEuBpDmukxx1otFamYf5k\n\nrdd RuYcDcmXWky8CyvW79pq1qxePi72FucuiG\n\nstrat SdAmVfGT1K8MnsmuYQby2wJibmeiHnQwVH\n\nxlm GDTNDX3YTBIQY5XLVFWS3ODIEZJBFEBW5SLCWAB23EGFQWHEAZL6C2KC\n\nvia via1qwwkc2ssfu0sy7c6qhr8e4curh64j8vglc0pz0m\n\nxrp rMWCnxwDxHyCapmgYTypH3f54XqkLYfxhZ\n\npa P1018554560\n\nChecking the BTC wallet addresses used in the campaign, we were able to see the balance details for each of them.

The Etherium wallet contained 2.792996354 ETH—\nwhich is the equivalent of approximately $6,700 USD.\n\n## The Raccoon/QuilClipper connection\n\nWhile analyzing similar samples to .Net loader and clipper on Virustotal, we found more samples hosted on the domain bbhmnn778.fun.\nSome of the .NET loaders were Raccoon Stealer, and both the QuilClipper and Raccoon samples use the Raccoon Telegram channel we\nfound in our initial Raccoon sample: telete.in/jbitchsucks. Investigating these files and searching on their filenames, we found a YouTube\nchannel that promotes Raccoon Stealer and QuilClipper.\n\n\n-----\n\n“Black Rabbit”, A YouTube channel promoting\n\nRaccoon Stealer and QuilClipper. (Now removed)\nIn the video promoting QuilClipper, the same actor nickname (MickeyMF) is referenced.\n\n## Raccoon infrastructure\n\nTo get a better sense of Raccoon’s second-stage deployment infrastructure, we checked the other subdomains connected to the root domain,\n**xsph.ru. There are records of over 60 subdomains under xsph.ru, and 21 that have been active in all of these domains were registered**\nthrough the Russian hosting provider SprintHost.ru, and managed through that company’s domain name service. But there are no current\nhosts associated with the domains, and the domain registration itself expired at the end of July, 2021.\n\nMany of the subdomains followed the same naming pattern as the subdomain used in our Raccoon sample, while others were clearly reserved\nfor other tasks—including phishing (such as subdomains named “wellsfargosecurecloud” and “chaseonlinesecure”). Sophos telemetry for\nsubdomains shows it being regularly used as part of phishing activity for at least the last year. The hosts used to serve these subdomain\nnames have been hosted on various shared IP addresses on SprintHost’s infrastructure in St. Petersburg. They’ve been connected to other\nmalware downloads as well.\n\nCasting a wider net, we looked at other domains that have been associated with Raccoon infrastructure over the past six months. The name\n**Marina Grodovich crops up frequently in registrations of Raccoon Stealer gate domains. The name has been tied to a total of 94 domains**\nused since September, 2020 in Raccoon Stealer attacks.\n\nA RiskIQ screenshot showing some of the 94\n\ndomains tied to the organization name used to register Raccoon Stealer command and control gateway domains.\n\n\n-----\n\na y o t e seco d stage do a s ost g pay oad do oads a e t ed to a s g e G a add ess t at as used to eg ste t e o e a p e,\nthe Raccoon demonstrated on Youtube uses aun3xk17k.space to download QuilClipper.\n\nAccording to Have I Been Pwned, this address\n\nwas used to register a “hacking” community (see below), and various legitimate websites like Linkedin, Dropbox, and Bitly.\n\n## Crime at your service\n\nThis Raccoon Stealer campaign is indicative of how industrialized criminal activity has become. Using a collection of paid services—the\ndropper-as-a-service to deploy Raccoon, in addition to the stealer-as-a-service Raccoon itself, and what may be an underlying malware\nhosting-as-a-service underlying all of these components—the actor behind this Raccoon campaign was able to\n\ndeploy malware\nsteal cookies and credentials\nsell those stolen credentials on criminal marketplaces\nsteal approximately $13,200 US worth of cryptocurrency, and use the compute resources of victims to mine another $2,900 in\ncryptocurrency over a 6-month period.\n\nTo produce this return, the actor paid Raccoon’s operators about $1200 over the period, plus $50 malware build fees—roughly 10 percent of\nthe take—plus the cost of the dropper delivery. All of this required only basic technical skills on the part of the actor running the campaign.\n\nIt’s these kinds of economics that make this type of cybercrime so attractive—and pernicious. Multiplied over tens or hundreds of individual\nRaccoon actors, it generates a livelihood for Raccoon’s developers and a host of other supporting malicious service providers that allows them\nto continue to improve and expand their criminal offerings. And those offerings largely hit consumers—especially, as in this case, when they\nmake use of searches for free versions of commercial software.\n\n## Protection details\n\nSophos protects against Raccoon and other stealers in multiple ways—by signature, reputation, static analysis and behavior. QuilClipper is\nalso stopped, as are the droppers observed in this campaign.\n\n[SophosLabs has published the indicators of compromise relating to samples discussed in this report on the SophosLabs Github page.](https://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs/blob/master/raccoonstealer.csv)\n\n\n-----",
