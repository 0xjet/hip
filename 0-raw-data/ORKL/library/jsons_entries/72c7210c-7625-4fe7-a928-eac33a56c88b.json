The timing of the last two trips of these groups of spies\ncoincided with two severe poisoning incidents in April and May of that year involving a\nBulgarian arms manufacturer, his son, and the production chief of his group of plants.\nIn 2015, the poisonings had remained unresolved. A privately-commissioned analysis\nstudy at a OPCW-certified lab in Finland had found traces of an unknown substance\nfrom the organophoshate family.\nOne of the GRU spies present in Bulgaria during both poisonings was “Sergey\nFedotov”, the cover identity of Denis Sergeev, a GRU Major General who was also in\nthe UK during the 2018 attempt on the lives of Sergey Skripal and his daughter.\nFollowing our disclosures and a request by the victim, in 2019 Bulgarian investigative\n[authorities re-opened the cold case from 2015. They subsequently indicted three of the](https://studiox.prb.bg/bg/sgp/news/aktualno/sofijska-gradska-prokuratura-predostavja-dopyl-84)\nGRU officers and placed them on the Interpol Red Notice list. These three indicted men\nwere Maj. Gen. Denis Sergeev (“Sergey Fedotov”), Lt. Col. Sergey Lyutenko (“Sergey\nPavlov”), and Col. Egor Gordienko (“Georgy Gorshkov”).\nWe [discovered that following the failed assassination attempt, Egor Gordienko had](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/02/25/an-officer-and-a-diplomat-the-strange-case-of-the-gru-spy-with-a-red-notice/)\nbeen deployed to Geneva as a senior Russian diplomat where he served until the end\nof 2018.\nBulgarian authorities also released surveillance footage showing one of the three –\npresumably Denis Sergeev – wearing a disguise and approaching several cars in an\nunderground garage where the poison victims’ cars had been parked.\nOn 26 August 2020, Bulgaria’s prosecution office suspended the criminal proceedings\nagainst the three indicted suspects. The reasons given in the decision were the\nimpossibility to proceed with fact-finding in the absence of detained suspects, and long\ndelays in obtaining international legal assistance from third countries. While this step\ndoesn’t imply a termination of the criminal proceedings, it means that the case will\nremain “frozen” for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Our investigative team, including Bellingcat and** **[The Insider Russia, has obtained a](http://theins.ru/)**\n**copy of the suspension decision which contains a summary of Bulgarian**\n**investigators’ findings, many of which are previously unknown to the public. These**\n**shed more light on whom exactly the GRU targeted for assassination, as well as on**\n**the course of events surrounding the poisoning attempts including the time between**\n**exposure to the poison and the onset of the first symptoms. Paired with new booking**\n**and travel data obtained by our investigative team, these findings shed more light on**\n**the modus operandi of the GRU’s elite kill team.**\n\n**These new findings may be particularly relevant in the context of the disclosure that**\n**the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was also caused by**\n**exposure to a substance from the Novichok family. The findings also showcase the**\n**extreme recklessness of this assassination method which exposes random people to**\n**the deadly substance – as seen both in the case with Gebrev’s son and in the death of**\n**[Dawn Sturgess in 2018.](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45000472)**\n\n**We have also obtained new data on the interaction of Bulgarian investigators with**\n**international bodies like the OPCW, the Finnish laboratory, and Finnish investigative**\n**authorities, which suggest that not all all avenues for fact-finding have been explored**\n**in full, and some efforts may have been blocked by third parties for unclear reasons.**\n**In addition, we note that the role of at least one accessory to the crime has not been**\n**investigated despite credible evidence of his involvement.**\n\n## Anatomy of a Murder Attempt: The Long Stakeout\n\nThe three GRU undercover officers indicted by Bulgarian authorities\n\nThe prosecution’s document lays out the chronology of events that led to the intentional\norganoposphate poisoning of three Bulgarian citizens in April 2015, with a repeat attempt on\ntheir lives a month later. The facts presented in the case – which broadly align with the\n\n\n-----\n\ntimeline previously identified by us, complemented by our additional findings, point to a wellprepared, long-running operation that involved a preparatory phase with multiple trips and\ndifferent teams.\n\nThe first planning trip identified in the prosecution’s document was on 15 February 2015. The\nthree indicted GRU officers arrived on the same date to Bulgaria’s capital of Sofia, but using\nthree different flights and arrival countries: “Gorshkov” (Gordienko) arrived first at 12:23 on\nAeroflot flight SU2060 from Moscow, “Fedotov” (Sergeev) flew in from Belgrade at 15:58 on\nAir Serbia flight JU122, and “Pavlov” (Lyutenko) arrived at 18:08 from Athens, Greece.\n\nAccording to the indictment documents, “Sergey Pavlov” booked Hotel Hill for the week\nstarting 15 February 2015, and requested a room on the third floor with a view to the parking\n[area. Hotel Hill is adjacent to Emilian Gebrev’s main corporate office at Emco Ltd, and a view](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Emco+Ltd/@42.6720295,23.320907,81a,35y,39.32t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x40aa84555648e1ef:0x9e6b603b5dcbeba5!8m2!3d42.6727004!4d23.3207214)\nto the parking area in front of the hotel would also ensure a view to the complete walkway\nfrom Emco’s entrance to the underground garage where Gebrev and his employees park\ntheir cars.\n\nInvestigators also determined that during the same period, “Gorshkov” stayed at Hotel\nMarinella, which is a short walk from the Hill Hotel and the Emco offices. He requested a\nroom on the 15th floor, with a direct view to the entrance to the underground garage. While\nBulgarian investigators say they did not uncover records showing “Fedotov” stayed at the\nsame hotel, Bellingcat has found records showing he stayed there together with “Gorshkov”.\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth Gorshkov and Pavlov rented cars upon arrival. It is unclear what their itinerary during\nthe week was, but shopping records from “Gorshkov”‘s VISA credit card (issued in the name\nof his cover identity) show that at least he stayed within the limits of the capital Sofia during\nthis period. However, his total mileage during the week was 128 km, which suggests he may\nhave taken short trips outside Sofia. “Pavlov”‘s mileage was even lower, at 87 km.\nInvestigators believe that this whole week was dedicated to tailing their main target – Emilian\nGebrev – and identifying patterns of his daily routine.\n\nGorshkov’s car rental reservation, obtained by our investigative team\n\nCuriously, “Gorshkov”‘s credit card records show multiple souvenir purchases from Sofia,\nincluding boutique cosmetics, sports goods and children toys. It appears personal shopping\non a tax-payers’ funded credit card is not frowned upon within the GRU – possibly justified as\nalibi-ensuring behavior.\n\nAt the end of this preparatory visit, the three officers departed back to Russia – with\n“Fedotov” and “Pavlov” sharing an Aeroflot flight to Moscow on 22 February 2015, and\n“Gorshkov” leaving on a different Aeroflot flight that same day.\n\n## Repeat Tourists\n\n\n-----\n\nThe same trio of seeming independently traveling tourists returned to Bulgaria just two\nmonths later, On 22 April 2015, “Pavlov” flew from Moscow to Sofia. Two days later, on 24\nApril 2015, “Gorshkov” and “Fedotov” flew into the seaside resort city of Bourgas, apparently\nfor increased operational security. Pavlov had initially rented an apartment approximately 50\nmeters from the Emco offices, and two days later – on the day the other two members\narrived – moved in to the same Hill Hotel as during his first trip, requesting specifically the\nsame room with a view on the third floor.\n\nThe other two chose a more circuitous arrival to the crime scene. Upon landing in Bourgas,\n“Fedotov” and “Gorshkov” rented a car in Gorshkov’s name and drove 140 km north in the\ndirection of Varna, Bulgaria’s other large seaside city. There, they both checked in at the Best\nWestern Park hotel just for one night. They drove on to Sofia the next day, but stayed at\ndifferent locations there. Gorshkov booked a three-room apartment in downtown Sofia, about\n3 km away from the Emco office. The reservation was made until 30 April – and both he and\n“Fedotov” had bought returning tickets to Moscow for that day. During the same period\n“Fedotov” had rented an apartment located approximately 300 meters from the offices of\nEmco.\n\nNone of the three would stay until the end of their prepaid period, or use their purchased\nreturn tickets. They bought new, earlier return tickets – and flew back to Moscow via Istanbul\nin the evening of 28 April 2015 – as soon as they (thought) they had completed their mission.\n\n## The Fruit of the Poisonous Three\n\nEmilian Gebrev fell seriously ill and subsided into a coma on the evening of 28 April 2015,\nduring a business dinner with Polish partners he was hosting in a restaurant at the Marinella\nHotel – the same place where “Gorshkov” and “Fedotov” had stayed at in February. His\ncompany’s production manager – Valentin Tahchiev – fell seriously ill two days later, and\nEmilian’s adult son Hristo Gebrev showed milder symptoms of poisoning on 4 May 2015. The\nstaggered timing of the poisoning of the three – as well as the choice of targets – had\nremained a source of mystery to observers. However, video footage from an underground\ngarage used by the Gebrev’s company may hold answers to these puzzling questions.\n\n\n-----\n\nBulgarian businessman Emilian Gebrev. Photo (c) Capital.bg, used with permission\n\nBulgarian investigative authorities believe that a yet-unidentified type of organophosphate\nnerve agent was applied to the door handles of the victims’ cars while they were parked in a\npublic garage just behind the Hill Hotel. The garage is open to the public on a subscription\nbasis, and is the main parking area used by employees of Emco, the holding company for\nGebrev’s arms manufacturing and trading business. An analysis of the the footage from the\ngarage’s security cameras lays out a convincing case for this hypothesis.\n\nOn the day on which Emilian Gebrev first fell ill, 28 April 2015, he drove into the garage and\nparked his Nissan GTR at 11:07 am, promptly leaving on foot towards his office. In the\nfollowing two hours his company’s production manager, Valentin Tahchiev, and his personal\ndriver, Oleg Lazarov, parked their own cars – a Toyota Land Cruiser and a Mercedes S Class\nrespectively, in the same garage.\n\nAt 13:58 the surveillance cameras captured the presence in the garage of a person wearing\na felt hat and black gloves, and holding something in hand. He initially approached Valentin\nTahchiev’s Land Cruiser and lingered next to it – his hands out of camera view – for a few\nseconds. Then he turned towards Gebrev’s Nissan GTR – which was parked right next to the\nToyota – and also lingered there for a few seconds. Here, too, the camera angle did not allow\nfor his manipulation of the car to be seen. He circled each of the two cars three times in the\ncourse of 2 minutes.\n\nThen the figure started walking towards the exit of the garage. A different camera registered\nhim stopping and lingering at the Mercedes usually driven by Gebrev’s driver. Here, the\nperson stayed for a few seconds on the right-hand (passenger) side of the car, before\nmoving on towards the exit. At 14:02 – only four minutes after his first appearance in the\n\n\n-----\n\ngarage – the figure took advantage of the garage slide-up door being opened by a new\nentering car, and exited the parking area in the same way as he had entered four minutes\nearlier.\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/sKhfsjgtIuQ\n\nJust over ten minutes after the figure exited the garage, at 14:15, Gebrev’s personal driver\nwalked in and drove out with his Mercedes S. He picked up Emilian Gebrev shortly thereafter\non the way to a business meeting. Gebrev felt the first symptoms of severe intoxication just\nbefore dinner, and collapsed into a coma at approximately 20:30 at the restaurant in the\nMarinella hotel.\n\nMr. Tahchiev, Emco’s production manager, didn’t pick up his car until two days later, in the\nearly morning of 30 April. He drove out of the garage and returned the car to it three hours\nlater, at 9:40. Shortly thereafter he also collapsed with symptoms similar to – but milder than\n– those of Gebrev. He checked into Sofia’s Tokuda hospital at 6 pm on the same day. His\nsymptoms included slurred speech, blurred vision, effusive perspiration, severely constricted\npupils, extremely high blood pressure and continuous vomiting. After three days of\nsypmotmatic treatment, his status was somewhat improved but he had no memory of the\npreceding days. After his family discovered the similar symptoms experienced by Emilian\nGebrev, he was moved to a different hospital and was diagnosed with organophosphatic\npoisoning. The difference in severity between his symptoms and those experienced by\nGebrev might be explained by the unexpectedly long time elapsed between the application of\nthe substance to the car door handle and the moment of exposure.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt approximately 10:30 on the same morning, Emilian Gebrev s son, Hristo Gebrev, entered\nthe garage and approached his father’s car. He opened the trunk, appearing to inspect it;\nthen walked around the car. He could be seen holding something resembling a hand-held\nmeasuring device near the driver-side window. He then did the same with the production\ndirector’s car parked right next to Gebrev’s one.\n\nWhile the prosecution document does not propose a hypothesis for Gebrev’s son’s activity –\nand apparently did not even question him in the course of the investigation – sources close\nto the victims informed us that Hristo Gebrev was using a borrowed hand-held hazardous\nsubstances “sniffer” device in a desperate attempt to identify the cause of his father’s critical\nintoxication. At that time, doctors were struggling to find the source of the poisoning in order\nto select the appropriate treatment for Emilian Gebrev.\n\nHristo Gebrev himself fell ill four days later, on 4 May 2015. His symptoms were significantly\nmilder than those of his father and Valentin Tahchiev, and this may be explained by the\nminimal exposure the the organoposphate during the two cars inspection.\n\n## “Mission Failed. Try Again?”\n\nBoth Emilian Gebrev and Valentin Tahchiev were admitted in critical conditions: Gebrev into\nthe hospital of Sofia’s Military-Medical Academy, and Tahchieve into the emergency\n“Pirogov” clinic – and were treated for severe poisoning with an unknown substance. As\nback in 2015 the public awareness of Russia’s revived use of organoposphates of the\nNovichok type was non-existent, they – and particularly Gebrev, who experienced by far\nmore severe symptoms – survived solely due to aggressive symptomatic treatment by\nexperienced doctors with hands-on war zone medical experience.\n\nThe Pirogov hospital diagnosis in the case of Mr. Tahchiev states: “Intoxication with an organoposphatic\n\nsubstance. Cholinomimetic syndrome M and N”\n\n\n-----\n\nBy mid-May both Gebrev and Tahchiev were released from hospital and began their\nrecuperation period at their homes. Just three days later, on 18 May 2015, booking records\nobtained by our investigative team show the GRU kill team started planning a renewed\nattempt to complete their failed mission. Hotels were booked and tickets purchased on 18\nMay, and five days later on 23 May 2015, two of persistent trio of tourists returned to Bulgaria\nfor the third time that year. “Sergey Fedotov” and “Georgy Gorshkov” flew in from Moscow to\nSofia on a joint Aeroflot flight SU2060. This time, however, they were not joined by “Sergey\nPavlov”.\n\nThe indictment document does not mention a third person during the GRU kill team’s\nremedial, third trip. However, as we reported earlier, based on leaked travel and hotel\nbooking data reviewed by us, we discovered that during this visit the trio was replenished\nwith a new member. He arrived from Moscow to Sofia on the same day as “Fedotov and\n“Gorshkov”. The new entry was “Danil Stepanov”, the cover identity of another member of\nthe elite GRU kill team whose real name is Danil Kapralov.\n\nDanil Kapralov, a.k.a. “Danil Stepanov”. Left, photograph from a social media profile of Kapralov’s family\n\nmember, right, photograph from “Stepanov’s” travel passport.\n\nUnlike Lyutenko (“Pavlov”), Kapralov had medical education in addition to his Spetsnaz skills.\nLike “Pavlov”, however, “Stepanov” was a lover of hotel rooms with the view. A reservation\nfrom Booking.com he made – obtained by our investigative team – shows him requesting\nliterally “A room with a good view” at the Hill Hotel.\n\n\n-----\n\nJust like during the previous GRU trip in April, only one member – “Stepanov” – was\nstationed near Gebrev’s office. The planned sojourn at the Hill Hotel was from 23-29 May\n2015. “Fedotov” and “Gorshkov” again took residence for the same period at a relatively\nremote hotel, about 3 km away.\n\nHowever, upon arrival to Sofia, the GRU trio was confronted with an unexpected\ndevelopment. Emilian Gebrev and his son had decided to drive to the family’s seaside\nhouse, where they thought the clean, iodine-filled air would accelerate the recovery process.\n\n## The Road Trip\n\n\n-----\n\nThe exact itinerary for the GRU trio for the next five days is not clear. They rented a car for\nthe period 23-30 May – again in the name of “Gorshkov” – which had no in-built GPS system\nand therefore could not be traced by investigators (notably, in each case the GRU team\nchose a relatively old and/or inexpensive car model that did not have onboard GPS tracking).\nCredit card records show that the trio stayed in Sofia at least the first day upon arrival, as\npurchases from a sports good shop were registered that evening.\n\nWhat investigators appear convinced about is that by 28 May 2015, the GRU officers had\ncaught up with the Gebrevs’ at the seaside some four hours drive from Sofia. On that day,\nEmilian Gebrev felt a recurrence of the familiar symptoms and his condition began\ndeteriorating. Upon the onset of symptoms, his son drove him back straight to the Military\nMedical Hospital in Sofia and checked him again in into the emergency ward.\n\nThe next day, 29 May, “Gorshkov” and “Fedotov” crossed the Bulgarian-Serbian border with\ntheir rented car and returned it on the following day at Belgrade airport. They flew back to\nMoscow that same day. “Stepanov” had returned to Moscow on a direct flight from Sofia on\n29 May 2015.\n\n## Unanswered Questions\n\nThe prosecution decision to suspend investigations – which presumably tracks closely the\nindictment document in its fact-finding part – presents a convincing case for the direct causal\nrelationship between the three named suspects and the near-fatal poisoning of the three\nBulgarian citizens. However, the investigations completed thus far leave a number of open\nquestions that need to be addressed.\n\n### Identity of the man with the hat\n\nBulgarian investigators do not name the identity of the figure in the underground garage, but\nconclude that he applied a powerful nerve agent of organophosphate group to the door\nhandles of the cars to be likely used by Emilian Gebrev and his production manager. As we\n[reported previously, Bulgarian authorities have requested assistance from US investigators](https://twitter.com/christogrozev/status/1204365213673373696)\nin enhancing the quality of the surveillance video in order to determine the identity of the\nperson. This has reportedly not yielded results.\n\nOur [previous](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/02/21/the-search-for-denis-sergeev-photographing-a-ghost/) [reporting has concluded that the figure most likely is Maj. Gen. Denis Sergeev,](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/02/14/third-suspect-in-skripal-poisoning-identified-as-denis-sergeev-high-ranking-gru-officer/)\na.k.a. “Sergey Fedotov”. He is the senior-most member of the mission who also took\nstronger operational security measures during both trips (few of the hotel or apartment\nbookings and none of the car rentals were in his name; also there were no credit card\npurchases made on his credit card). He was also the only member known to have been part\nof another similar assassination attempt – as a senior member of the Skripal poisoning\nmission in 2018. This determination is, however, not conclusive, and it is possible that one of\nthe other two team members was charged with the last-mile task of applying the poisonous\n\n\n-----\n\nsubstance. An argument against the hypothesis for Fedotov would be the fact that in the\nSkripal case, he had a supervising role, and junior team members – Col. Mishkin and Col.\nChepiga – were presumably tasked with crossing the last mile of the operation.\n\nDetermining the identity of the person in the garage is important not solely for attribution of\nculpability in the Bulgarian case but also to better understand the MO of Russian secret\nservices protocols in similar assassination operations – knowledge that is likely to prove\nuseful in deciphering other assassination attempts.\n\n_Possible approaches to determining the identity – absent facial data – include further_\n_investigation into telecoms data – identifying the number and residual metadata from the_\n_phones used by the three members, as well as gait analysis and comparison based on video_\n_samples of the three known suspects._\n\n### Partial list of suspects\n\nThe Bulgarian authorities have charged three suspects with the crime. However, evidence\nexists that ties at least three more members of the same GRU unit to the time and place of\n[the operation. As we previously wrote, at least six of the Unit 21955 undercover officers](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/11/23/the-dreadful-eight-grus-unit-29155-and-the-2015-poisoning-of-emilian-gebrev/)\nappeared to have been involved in the planning of the Gebrev operation, based on the timing\nof their synchronized “staggered” arrivals and departures in the period from February to May\n2015. The Bulgarian authorities have charged three of them, and the indictment documents\ndo not include details of investigation of the potential role of any of the others.\n\nIn the case of at least one additional person (“Stepanov”/Kapralov), the links are hard to\nexplain away with any other hypothesis than direct involvement in the incriminated operation.\nBulgarian investigators could relatively easily prove or disprove the hypothesis of\ninvolvement of the other members by applying data collection similar to the one implemented\non the main three. This does not appear to have been done.\n\n### Non-attribution\n\nThe prosecution document refers to the three indicted suspects by their cover identities only.\nAs previously disclosed by us, these are artificially created identities that do not exist; thus,\ncharging suspects under these identities is little more than an empty gesture. The real\nidentities behind the suspects’ cover names have been publicly disclosed by us and\nBulgarian investigators have reportedly issued Interpol warrants under both sets of names, in\nline with our identifications.\n\nNon-inclusion of the real names, as well as the absence of attribution of the actions of the\nthree indicted persons to Russia’s military intelligence, also leads to inability to determine a\nmotive for the crime. Predictably, therefore, motives are not even discussed in the\nprosecution’s decision.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on information from the victims, the prosecution authorities have not even filed a\nformal request with Russian authorities in relation to the actual identity of the suspects. While\na response from Russia – in keeping with recent precedent – is unlikely to result in usable\ninformation, an unconvincing reaction will permit investigative authorities in Bulgaria to use\nalternative methods, including intelligence, to determine the real identities.\n\nNotably, the prosecution document notes that it has received information from Swedish\nintelligence that one of the indicted suspects – “Sergey Fedotov” – received a short-term\nSwedish-issued Schengen visa in early 2014 on the basis of a joint application with\n“Alexander Petrov”. The birth date for “Petrov” matches that of Alexander Mishkin, one of the\nmain two suspects in the Skripal attempted murder case – which UK authorities have\nofficially been attributed to the GRU. While Bulgarian prosecutors point to this direct link with\nthe Skripal case as corroboration for the guilt of “Fedotov”, they shy away from following\nthrough with the logical conclusion that the same group – GRU – must have been behind the\nBulgarian operation.\n\n_Our Russian investigative partner The Insider has addressed Russian investigative_\n_authorities with a question whether they have received a formal request for assistance in_\n_determining the identity of the suspects and bringing them to justice._\n\n## International Dysfunction\n\nWhile some of the lack of progress in the investigation of the Gebrev poisoning case can be\nattributed to the seemingly timid actions of Bulgarian prosecutors, other aspects appear to be\ncaused by deadlocks and inefficiencies in international legal cooperation. A crucial deadlock\nin this case is the absence of definitive determination of the used poisonous substance.\n\nBulgarian prosecutors’ timid attempts to engage the OPCW’s expertise in determining the\nsubstance ended up in a legal cul-de-sac, as Bulgarian authorities insisted on the application\nof Bulgarian criminal code of procedure to the OPCW involvement, while the organization\ndeclined to comply and referred to existing regulation that necessitates a peer-to-peer (stateparty) approach to interactions with the OPCW. While from a legalistic perspective the\nOPCW position appears to be correct, the (global) public interest in this case would\npresuppose a higher level of proactive involvement by the only international organization\nhaving the ability to harness the available expertise needed to determine the nature and\nprovenance of a particularly dangerous chemical substance.\n\nBulgarian investigators’ efforts to receive assistance from Verifin – the OPCW-accredited lab\nin Finland which conducted the initial analysis of blood samples from Emilian Gebrev in 2015\n– appear to have stalled as well. While the original report from Verifin contained a\ncommitment that samples will be kept and available for a five year period – until June 2020 –\nan official 2019 query from Bulgarian investigators to Verifin seen by us yielded a much\nbelated response that no samples are available anymore. No further explanations were\nprovided in the response. In the meantime, the original five-year conservation period has\n\n\n-----\n\nlapsed, leaving Bulgarian investigators with no obvious way forward to determine the exact\nsubstance used. A personal attempt by Emilian Gebrev to invoke the assistance of the\nFinnish lab VERIFIN – for whose analysis he had paid in 2015 – yielded no response. He\nthen asked for help from Finland’s prosecution to establish how and why his own blood\nsamples – to which he had received a commitment of storage for 5 years – had vanished\nfrom VERIFIN – this also yielded no results. In a formal response he received, Finnish\nprosecutors point him to Bulgarian law enforcement as “the crime was committed on\nBulgarian territory.”\n\nThe lack of proactive international cooperation in this case appears to be systemic and has\nramifications well beyond the individual criminal proceedings in Bulgaria. It also possibly pits\nthe victims’ truth-finding interests against opaque and possibly political interests of state\nparties. The disappearing test samples in Gebrev’s case draw parallels to another recent\ncase in which a Russian opposition figure targeted presumably by Russian security services\nhad his [test results withheld and “classified” by the FBI, leaving him uncertain of what really](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/stonewalling-fbi-fuels-suspicion-of-poison-pact-with-kremlin-h99pp60jg)\nhappened to him, and how he can prevent it from happening again.\n\nGiven the mounting evidence of state parties such as Russia using chemical weapons and\nnerve agents for extrajudicial assassinations – both abroad and, as it appears from the\nNavalny case, at home – little progress can be expected in crime solving or prevention\nwithout a vastly more streamlined, technocratic system of international legal cooperation that\nis impermeable to political interests.\n\n\n-----",
