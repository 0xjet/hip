    "plain_text": "# THREAT ANALYSIS\n\n\n# ANALYSIS\n\n\n## HOGFISH REDLEAVES CAMPAIGN\n### HOGFISH (APT10) targets Japan with RedLeaves implants in “new battle”\n\n\n# THREAT\n\n\n-----\n\n##### iDefense analysts have identified recent campaigns attributed to APT10, also known as HOGFISH and Stone Panda. This report provides a technical overview of the bespoke RedLeaves implants leveraged by the actor in their “new battle” campaign.\n\n\niDefense is providing information about this reported campaign to the general\niDefense customer base so that customers are aware of the modus operandi of a\nhighly active threat group that is targeting institutions for espionage purposes,\nespecially in Japan.\n\nMore specifically, this threat analysis is intended for security operations center (SOC)\nanalysts and engineers. Intelligence analysts may also want to read this report.\nAdditionally, management and executive leadership may want to use this information.\n\nSOC analysts and engineers can use this threat analysis detailed information\npertaining to the workings of a malware family and indicators of compromise (IoCs) to\ncontain or mitigate the discussed threat through monitoring or blocking. SOC analysts\ncan use the information provided in the Analysis and Mitigation sections of this IA to\nconduct hunting activities on systems that may have already been compromised.\n\nAnalysts and security engineers can use the IoCs by adding them to hunting lists on\nEndpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions as well as network- and host-based\nblacklists to detect and deny malware implantation and command-and-control (C2)\ncommunication. Intelligence analysts may want to use the information provided in this\nIA to better inform their own analyses. The provided information can also help inform\nongoing intelligence analyses and forensic investigations, particularly for compromise\ndiscovery, damage assessment, and attribution.\n\nManagement and executive leadership may use this information to assess the risks\nassociated with the threat described herein to make operational and policy decisions\naccordingly.\n\nKnowledge of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the operators\nbehind this campaign helps to better inform detection and response to attacks by this\nthreat group.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### HOGFISH (APT10) TARGETS JAPAN WITH REDLEAVES IMPLANTS IN NEW BATTLE \n\n###### REDLEAVES ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample that iDefense analyzed for this report is a Word document with Japanese\nfilename, 2018年度（平成30年度）税制改正について.doc, which translates to English as\n“About the 2018 fiscal year (Heisei 30) tax system revision.doc”. This document has the\nfollowing properties:\n\n  - **Filename: 2018年度（平成30年度）税制改正について.doc**\n\n  - **MD5: 797b450509e9cad63d30cd596ac8b608**\n\n  - **File Size: 664.2 KB (680,095 bytes)**\n\n  - **Author: Windows ユーザー (Windows user)**\n\n  - **Last Modified by: Windows ユーザー (Windows user)**\n\n  - **Creation Time Stamp: 2018-01-09 03:56:00 (Jan. 9, 2018, 3:56 a.m.)**\n\n  - **Modified Time Stamp: 2018-01-09 04:25:00 (Jan. 9, 2018, 4:25 a.m.)**\n\nAfter the document is opened, the victim is presented with a message from Office 365 to\nasking the victim to “Enable content” (see Exhibit 1). On the next page, however,\niDefense identified what appears to be a base64-encoded string.\n\n**Exhibit 1: Dropper Document**\n\nThe macro shown in Exhibit 2 will then perform the following sequence of actions:\n\n  - Drop the embedded base64-encoded content into a new file,\nZsHUvtNctKYbgPj.txt, in the %temp% folder\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Decode this new file by leveraging “certutil”, a legitimate Windows program; the\nbase64 encoded data decodes to a Microsoft Corp. Cabinet file, which is saved as\nYjhdJ.cab (MD5 hash: 44c7319d8d7b84c52c4a6c94056d246b)\n\n  - Use “expand”, again a legitimate Windows program, to “expand” or decompress\nfile contents (AYRUNSC.exe and PTL.AYM) to the %temp% folder, and\nconsequently delete the earlier created files\n\n**Exhibit 2: VBA Macro**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this malware creates two new binaries: AYRUNSC.exe and\nPTL.AYM. AYRUNSC.exe is a legitimate and digitally signed binary created by ESTsoft\nCorp. and pertains to ALYac, Korean anti-virus software. PTL.AYM is in fact another binary\nfile; specifically, it is a DLL file with the following properties:\n\n  - **Filename: PTL.AYM**\n\n  - **Internal Filename: ptl.dll**\n\n  - **MD5: 4f1ffebb45b30dd3496caaf1fa9c77e3**\n\n  - **File Size: 440.0 KB (450,560 bytes)**\n\n  - **Compiled Time Stamp: 2018-01-08 02:15:02 (Jan. 8, 2018, 2:15 a.m.)**\n\nThe compiled time stamp, assuming it is not altered, suggests the actor developed the\nimplant 2 days before launching the described campaign.\n\nThis DLL is a clone of a legitimate DLL, also by ALYac, and corresponds to the anti-virus\nsoftware’s Utility Module. However, rather than the original DLL, it only has two imports\nas the authors have implemented a simple, single-byte XOR obfuscation (using key 0x40)\nto obfuscate other imports and strings. For example, XOR decoding the binary reveals\nthe following two interesting strings:\n\n  - %ProgramFiles%\\Internet Explorer\\iexplore.exe\n\n  - \\GppiTEMms.lnk\n\n\n-----\n\nAs opposed to the original DLL by ALYac, which typically has 15 exports, the analyzed\nsample has the following 20 exports:\n\n  - ChangeScriptName   - FreeList   - GetFileName\n\n  - GetFilePath   - GetFilePath2   - GetFilePathNew\n\n  - GetFilePathNew2   - GetFolderPath   - GetFolderPath2\n\n  - GetFolderPathNew   - GetFolderPathNew2   - GetPathVariable\n\n  - GetPathVariableList   - GetSIDList   - Initialize\n\n  - Initialize_IjDEJK   - Lock   - NbhgHUxiGf\n\n  - UnInitialize   - rGBKikBeJObSwSjY\n\nThree exported functions clearly stood out: Initialize_IjDEJK, NbhgHUxiGf, and\nrGBKikBeJObSwSjY. These are, however, all dummy exports to throw off analysts or\nperhaps even taunt researchers, and more specifically perhaps to taunt the Japan\nComputer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC).\n\nFor example, when executing the DLL file by calling the NbhgHUxiGf export function, the\nvictim would be prompted with a Windows message box with \"jpcert-1”, as can be shown\nin Exhibit 3 and 4.\n\n**Exhibit 3: Windows message box creation**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Exhibit 4: Windows message box with the message “jpcert-1”**\n\nAll other functions are either empty or also filled with calls to MessageBoxA(), which is\nunusual for DLL loading implants. However, one export function, GetFolderPathNew2, is\nresponsible for loading the RedLeaves DLL implant by performing process hollowing in\niexplore.exe, Microsoft Corp.’s default browser. The initial process, AYRUNSC.exe, is\nunable to work correctly and will therefore exit.\n\nFor persistence, RedLeaves will add a shortcut “.lnk” file in the user’s Startup folder,\nwhich points to `AYRUNSC.exe’, as shown in Exhibit 5.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Exhibit 5: GppiTEMms.lnk in Startup Folder**\n\nOnce running, the RedLeaves implant will then attempt to communicate with the\nfollowing C2 domains, using HTTP, but connects to the C2 server on port 443:\n\n  - firefoxcomt.arkouowi[.]com\n\n  - update.arkouowi[.]com\n\nThe configuration settings for the RedLeaves implant can be extracted from memory and\ncontains the following information:\n\n  - Campaign ID: 2018-1-8-NewBattle\n\n  - Mutex: jH10689DS\n\n  - Key: babybear\n\nThe string “2018-1-8-NewBattle” refers to the campaign ID set up by the actor and may\nallude the actor starting a “new battle” (campaigns). The malware will create a unique\nversion of the aforementioned mutex on the victim machine in order to avoid running the\nimplant twice.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs mentioned before, RedLeaves will attempt to communicate over HTTP, using POST\nrequests with a hardcoded User-Agent:\n\n\nPOST /M6Xz5MOS/index.php HTTP/1.1\n\n\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\n\nAccept: */*\n\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64;\nTrident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR\n3.0.30729; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)\n\n\nNetwork traffic is encrypted with RC4 using the key “babybear”.\n\n\nThe RedLeaves implant has at least the following abilities:\n\n  - Take screenshots\n\n  - Gather browser usernames and passwords\n\n  - Gather extended system information\n\n  - Send, receive, and execute commands from the C2 server\n\nFurther analysis also reveals that the RedLeaves implant described corresponds to the\nactor’s “Lavender” version of the malware family.\n\nFor example, the strings “LAVENDERX” and “LAVENDERengin” (which are dynamically\nbuilt on the stack) are used to determine the implant’s version.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OTHER REDLEAVES IMPLANTS\n\niDefense analysts also identified the RedLeaves samples with the following attributes:\n\n_ed65bbe9498d3fb1e4d4ac0058590d88_\n\n  - **Internal Filename: libcef.dll**\n\n  - **Starts in Function: cef_string_utf8_to_utf16**\n\n  - **Compiled Time Stamp: 2018-01-18 04:38:12 (Jan. 18, 2108, 4:38 a.m.)**\n\n  - **Startup Item/Shortcut: BnorTEPkh.lnk**\n\n  - **C2 Server: algorithm.ddnsgeek[.]com**\n\n  - **Campaign ID: 2018-1-18-sgowen**\n\n  - **Mutex: rV6880B9**\n\n  - **Key: babybear**\n\n_e2627a887898b641db720531258fd133_\n\n  - **Internal Filename: libcef.dll**\n\n  - **Starts in Function: cef_initialize**\n\n  - **Compiled Time Stamp: 2018-01-29 09:36:41 (Jan. 29, 2018, 9:36 a.m.)**\n\n  - **Startup Item/Shortcut: EaahLDRej.lnk**\n\n  - **C2 Server: friendlysupport.giize[.]com**\n\n  - **Campaign ID: 2018-1-29-No.1**\n\n  - **Mutex: 2N6541mb**\n\n  - **Key: moscowww**\n\nThe above sample, ed65bbe9498d3fb1e4d4ac0058590d88, also displays similar\ntaunting messages (see Exhibit 6 and 7):\n\n\n-----\n\n**Exhibit 6: Message box with a taunting message**\n\n**Exhibit 7: Message box with another taunting message**\n\n###### C2 INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nC2 infrastructure enumeration reveals overlap between the three samples that iDefense\nanalyzed, as Exhibit 8 illustrates.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Exhibit 8: Maltego Graph Showing Campaigns Overlap**\n\n###### MITIGATION\n\nTo effectively defend against the threats described in this report, iDefense recommends\nblocking access to the following C2 domains and IP addresses:\n\n  - firefoxcomt.arkouowi[.]com\n\n  - update.arkouowi[.]com\n\n  - friendlysupport.giize[.]com\n\n  - algorithm.ddnsgeek[.]com\n\n  - 149.36.63[.]65\n\n  - 83.136.106[.]108\n\n\n-----\n\nHashes (SHA-256):\n\n_d956e2ff1b22ccee2c5d9819128103d4c31ecefde3ce463a6dea19ecaaf418a1_\n_5504e04083d6146a67cb0d671d8ad5885315062c9ee08a62e40e264c2d5eab91_\n_f6449e255bc1a9d4a02391be35d0dd37def19b7e20cfcc274427a0b39cb21b7b_\n_db7c1534dede15be08e651784d3a5d2ae41963d192b0f8776701b4b72240c38d_\n\nRelated hashes (SHA-256):\n\n_f9acc706d7bec10f88f9cfbbdf80df0d85331bd4c3c0188e4d002d6929fe4eac_\n_e28294f62178451c7b11988d2c790f7f44c81b0bf06ab252e60f6b9ca57cacec_\n_36db2c5f8bb947cad25a4abeaff1ff0e827bd7fcf9c77dbfb36247e3fc9f530a_\n_4de5a22cd798950a69318fdcc1ec59e9a456b4e572c2d3ac4788ee96a4070262_\n_7188f76ca5fbc6e57d23ba97655b293d5356933e2ab5261e423b3f205fe305ee_\n_388d6b38f21c79e0e2ad7ead1108025b8bb3486d8d29f2468b5cb0e54bff11d2_\n_37333ecdd16b1ecbcd070b202492c1870dafd799f6299a420cdcc8a9e149cc93_\n\nFor threat hunting, it is also useful to examine the content of the following folders and\nlook out for anomalous data:\n\n  - %temp%\\AYRUNSC.exe\n\n  - %temp%\\PTL.AYM\n\n  - %appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\GppiTEMms.lnk\n\n  - %appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\EaahLDRej.lnk\n\n  - %appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\BnorTEPkh.lnk\n\n  - A mutex named jH10689DS, 2N6541mb, or rV6880B9.\n\n\n#### CONTACT US\n\n\nJoshua Ray\n[joshua.a.ray@accenture.com](mailto:joshua.a.ray@accenture.com)\n\nBart Parys\n[bart.parys@accenture.com](mailto:bart.parys@accenture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ABOUT ACCENTURE\n\nAccenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services\nand solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations.
