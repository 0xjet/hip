    "plain_text": "# A Closer Look at the DarkSide Ransomware Gang\n\n**[krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/a-closer-look-at-the-darkside-ransomware-gang/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/a-closer-look-at-the-darkside-ransomware-gang/)**\n\nThe FBI [confirmed this week that a relatively new ransomware group known as DarkSide is](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-network-disruption-at-colonial-pipeline)\nresponsible for an attack that caused Colonial Pipeline [to shut down 5,550 miles of pipe,](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/08/us/politics/cyberattack-colonial-pipeline.html)\nstranding countless barrels of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel on the Gulf Coast. Here’s a closer\nlook at the DarkSide cybercrime gang, as seen through their negotiations with a recent U.S.\nvictim that earns $15 billion in annual revenue.\n\nColonial Pipeline has shut down 5,500 miles of fuel pipe in response to a ransomware incident.\n\nImage: colpipe.com\n\n[New York City-based cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint said its analysts assess with a](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/)\nmoderate-strong degree of confidence that the attack was not intended to damage national\ninfrastructure and was simply associated with a target which had the finances to support a\nlarge payment.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis would be consistent with DarkSide s earlier activities, which included several big game\nhunting’ attacks, whereby attackers target an organization that likely possesses the financial\nmeans to pay the ransom demanded by the attackers,” Flashpoint observed.\n\nIn response to public attention to the Colonial Pipeline attack, the DarkSide group sought to\nplay down fears about widespread infrastructure attacks going forward.\n\n“We are apolitical, we do not participate in geopolitics, do not need to tie us with a defined\ngovernment and look for other our motives [sic],” reads an update to the DarkSide Leaks\nblog. “Our goal is to make money, and not creating problems for society. From today we\nintroduce moderation and check each company that our partners want to encrypt to avoid\nsocial consequences in the future.”\n\nFirst surfacing on Russian language hacking forums in August 2020, DarkSide is a\nransomware-as-a-service platform that vetted cybercriminals can use to infect companies\nwith ransomware and carry out negotiations and payments with victims. DarkSide says it\ntargets only big companies, and forbids affiliates from dropping ransomware on\norganizations in several industries, including healthcare, funeral services, education, public\nsector and non-profits.\n\nLike other ransomware platforms, DarkSide adheres to the current badguy best practice of\ndouble extortion, which involves demanding separate sums for both a digital key needed to\nunlock any files and servers, and a separate ransom in exchange for a promise to destroy\nany data stolen from the victim.\n\nAt its launch, DarkSide sought to woo affiliates from competing ransomware programs by\nadvertising a victim data leak site that gets “stable visits and media coverage,” as well as the\nability to publish victim data by stages. Under the “Why choose us?” heading of the\nransomware program thread, the admin answers:\n\n\n-----\n\nAn advertisement for the DarkSide ransomware group.\n\n“High trust level of our targets. They pay us and know that they’re going to receive decryption\ntools. They also know that we download data. A lot of data. That’s why the percent of our\nvictims who pay the ransom is so high and it takes so little time to negotiate.”\n\nIn late March, DarkSide introduced a “call service” innovation that was integrated into the\naffiliate’s management panel, which enabled the affiliates to arrange calls pressuring victims\ninto paying ransoms directly from the management panel.\n\nIn mid-April the ransomware program announced new capability for affiliates to launch\ndistributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against targets whenever added pressure is\nneeded during ransom negotiations.\n\nDarkSide also has advertised a willingness to sell information about upcoming victims before\ntheir stolen information is published on the DarkSide victim shaming blog, so that\nenterprising investment scammers can short the company’s stock in advance of the news.\n\n“Now our team and partners encrypt many companies that are trading on NASDAQ and\nother stock exchanges,” DarkSide explains. “If the company refuses to pay, we are ready to\nprovide information before the publication, so that it would be possible to earn in the\nreduction price of shares. Write to us in ‘Contact Us’ and we will provide you with detailed\ninformation ”\n\n\n-----\n\nDarkSide also started recruiting new affiliates again last month — mainly seeking network\n[penetration testers who can help turn a single compromised computer into a full-on data](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/amid-an-embarrassment-of-riches-ransom-gangs-increasingly-outsource-their-work/)\nbreach and ransomware incident.\n\nPortions of a DarkSide recruitment message, translated from Russian. Image: Intel 471.\n\n“We have grown significantly in terms of the client base and in comparison to other projects\n(judging by the analysis of publicly available information), so we are ready to grow our team\n[and a number of our affiliates in two fields,” DarkSide explained. The advertisement](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/darkside20.txt)\ncontinued:\n\n“Network penetration testing. We’re looking for one person or a team. We’ll adapt you to the\nwork environment and provide work. High profit cuts, ability to target networks that you can’t\nhandle on your own. New experience and stable income. When you use our product and the\nransom is paid, we guarantee fair distribution of the funds. A panel for monitoring results for\nyour target. We only accept networks where you intend to run our payload.”\n\nDarkSide has shown itself to be fairly ruthless with victim companies that have deep pockets,\n[but they can be reasoned with. Cybersecurity intelligence firm Intel 471 observed a](https://www.intel471.com/)\nnegotiation between the DarkSide crew and a $15 billion U.S. victim company that was hit\nwith a $30 million ransom demand in January 2021, and in this incident the victim’s efforts at\nnegotiating a lower payment ultimately reduce the ransom demand by almost two-thirds.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DarkSide ransomware note.\n\nThe first exchange between DarkSide and the victim involved the usual back-and-forth\nestablishing of trust, wherein the victim asks for assurances that stolen data will be deleted\nafter payment.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: Intel 471.\n\nWhen the victim counter-offered to pay just $2.25 million, DarkSide responded with a lengthy,\nderisive reply, ultimately agreeing to lower the ransom demand to $28.7 million.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe timer it [sic] ticking and in in next 8 hours your price tag will go up to $60 million, the\ncrooks replied. “So, you this are your options first take our generous offer and pay to us\n$28,750 million US or invest some monies in quantum computing to expedite a decryption\nprocess.”\n\nImage: Intel 471.\n\nThe victim complains that negotiations haven’t moved the price much, but DarkSide\ncountered that the company can easily afford the payout. “I don’t think so,” they wrote. “You\naren’t poor and aren’t children if you f*cked up you have to meet the consequences.”\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: Intel 471.\n\nThe victim firm replies a day later saying they’ve gotten authority to pay $4.75 million, and\ntheir tormentors agree to lower the demand significantly to $12 million.\n\nImage: Intel 471.\n\nThe victim replies that this is still a huge amount, and it tries to secure additional assurances\nfrom the ransomware group if it agrees to pay the $12 million, such as an agreement not to\ntarget the company ever again, or give anyone access to its stolen data. The victim also tried\nto get the attackers to hand over a decryption key before paying the full ransom demand.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: Intel 471.\n\nThe crime gang responded that its own rules prohibit it from giving away a decryption key\nbefore full payment is made, but they agree to the rest of the terms.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: Intel 471.\n\nThe victim firm agrees to pay an $11 million ransom, and their extortionists concur and\npromise not to attack or help anyone else attack the company’s network going forward.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: Intel 471\n\nFlashpoint assesses that at least some of the criminals behind DarkSide hail from another\n[ransomware outfit called “REvil,” a.k.a. “Sodinokibi” (although Flashpoint rates this finding at](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=revil)\n[only “moderate” confidence). REvil is widely considered to be the newer name for GandCrab,](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/07/is-revil-the-new-gandcrab-ransomware/)\na ransomware-as-a-service offering that closed up shop in 2019 after bragging that it had\nextorted more than $2 billion.\n\nExperts say ransomware attacks will continue to grow in sophistication, frequency and cost\nunless something is done to disrupt the ability of crooks to get paid for such crimes.\nAccording to [a report late last year from Coveware, the average ransomware payment in the](https://www.coveware.com/blog/q3-2020-ransomware-marketplace-report#:~:text=Average%20Ransomware%20Increases%20as%20Attackers%20Target%20Bigger%20Companies&text=The%20average%20ransom%20payment%20increased,to%20drag%20the%20averages%20up.)\nthird quarter of 2020 was $233,817, up 31 percent from the second quarter of last year.\nSecurity firm Emsisoft found that almost 2,400 U.S.-based governments, healthcare facilities\nand schools were victims of ransomware in 2020.\n\nLast month, a group of tech industry heavyweights lent their imprimatur to a task force that\n[delivered an 81-page report to the Biden administration on ways to stymie the ransomware](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/task-force-seeks-to-disrupt-ransomware-payments/#more-55321)\nindustry. Among many other recommendations, the report urged the White House to make\nfinding, frustrating and apprehending ransomware crooks a priority within the U.S.\nintelligence community, and to designate the current scourge of digital extortion as a national\nsecurity threat.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Further reading: Intel 471 s take on the Colonial Pipeline attack.](https://www.intel471.com/blog/darkside-ransomware-colonial-pipeline-attack)\n\n\n-----",
