Zimperium zLabs recently\ndiscovered an aggressive mobile premium services campaign with upwards of 10 million\n**victims globally, and the total amount stolen could be well into the hundreds of millions of**\nEuros. While typical premium service scams take advantage of phishing techniques, this\nspecific global scam has hidden behind malicious Android applications acting as Trojans,\nallowing it to take advantage of user interactions for increased spread and infection.\n\nThese malicious Android applications appear harmless when looking at the store\ndescription and requested permissions, but this false sense of confidence changes when\nusers get charged month over month for the premium service they get subscribed to without\ntheir knowledge and consent.\n\nThe Zimperium zLabs researchers discovered this global premium services Trojan\ncampaign through a rise in specific alerts from our z9 on-device malware detection engine,\nwhich detected and reported the true nature of these malicious Android applications.\n\nForensic evidence of this active Android Trojan attack, which we have named GriftHorse,\nsuggests that the threat group has been running this campaign since November 2020.\nThese malicious applications were initially distributed through both Google Play and thirdparty application stores. Zimperium zLabs reported the findings to Google, who verified the\nprovided information and removed the malicious applications from the Google Play store.\nHowever, the malicious applications are still available on unsecured third-party app\nrepositories, highlighting the risk of sideloading applications to mobile endpoints and user\ndata and needing advanced on-device security.\n\n_Disclosure: As a key member of the Google App Defense Alliance, Zimperium scans_\n_applications before publishing and provides an ongoing analysis of Android apps in the_\n_Google Play Store._\n\nIn this blog, we will:\n\nCover the capabilities of the GriftHorse Trojan;\n\n\n-----\n\nDiscuss the architecture of the applications;\nShow the communication with the C&C server; and\nExplore the global impact of the GriftHorse campaign.\n\n## What can the GriftHorse Android Trojan do?\n\nThe mobile applications pose a threat to all Android devices by functioning as a Trojan that\nsubscribes unsuspecting users to paid services, charging a premium amounting to around\n36 Euros per month.\n\nThe campaign has targeted millions of users from over 70 countries by serving selective\nmalicious pages to users based on the geo-location of their IP address with the local\nlanguage. This social engineering trick is exceptionally successful, considering users might\nfeel more comfortable sharing information to a website in their local language.\n\nUpon infection, the victim is bombarded with alerts on the screen letting them know they\nhad won a prize and needed to claim it immediately. These pop ups reappear no less than\nfive times per hour until the application user successfully accepts the offer. Upon accepting\nthe invitation for the prize, the malware redirects the victim to a geo-specific webpage\nwhere they are asked to submit their phone numbers for verification. But in reality, they are\nsubmitting their phone number to a premium SMS service that would start charging their\nphone bill over €30 per month. The victim does not immediately notice the impact of the\ntheft, and the likelihood of it continuing for months before detection is high, with little to no\nrecourse to get one’s money back.\n\nThese cybercriminals took great care not to get caught by malware researchers by avoiding\nhardcoding URLs or reusing the same domains and filtering / serving the malicious payload\nbased on the originating IP address’s geolocation. This method allowed the attackers to\ntarget different countries in different ways. This check on the server-side evades dynamic\nanalysis checking for network communication and behaviors.\n\nOverall, GriftHorse Android Trojan takes advantage of small screens, local trust, and\nmisinformation to trick users into downloading and installing these Android Trojans, as well\nfrustration or curiosity when accepting the fake free prize spammed into their notification\nscreens.\n\n## How does the GriftHorse Android Trojan work?\n\nThe Trojans are developed using the mobile application development framework named\n**Apache Cordova. Cordova allows developers to use standard web technologies – HTML5,**\nCSS3, and JavaScript for cross-platform mobile development. This technology enables\ndevelopers to deploy updates to apps without requiring the user to update manually.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile this framework should provide the user a better experience and security, the very\nsame technology can be abused to host the malicious code on the server and develop an\napplication that executes this code in real-time. The application displays as a web page that\nreferences HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.\n\nUpon installation and launch of the application, the encrypted files stored in the\n“assets/www” folder of the APK is decrypted using “AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding”. After\ndecryption, the file index.html is then loaded using the WebView class.\n\nFigure 1: The application code containing Key, IV, and file types to decrypt dynamically\n\nThe core functionality source code lies in the js/index.js file that calls onDeviceReady\nfunction which adds “Google Advertising ID (AAID) for Android devices” to appConf. The\ndata structure appConf is populated with AppsFlyerUID collected after initializing AppsFlyer\n\n\n-----\n\n(React Native AppsFlyer plugin) using the devKey. Following necessary checks, the\nprogram control is given to GetData().\n\nFigure 4: The contents of index.js file that calls GetData()\nThe GetData() function handles the communication between the application and the C&C\nserver by encrypting an HTTP POST request with the value of appConf.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: The GetData() function that communicates with the C&C server\nThe request and response network communication with the server can be seen in the\nfollowing screenshots, where the parameter “d” is the encrypted ciphertext of appConf.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe received encrypted response is decrypted using AES to collect the second-stage C&C\nURL and executes a GET request using Cordova’s InAppBrowser. The decrypted contents\nof the above communication can be seen in the following screenshots.\n\nFigure 9: The decrypted content of the response from the first-stage C&C server\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: The decrypted content of the POST request to the first-stage C&C server\n\nThe configuration for pushing the notifications is received in the response and displayed\nevery one hour for five times as seen in the below screenshot. The motive of this repetitive\nnotification pushing is to grab the user’s attention and navigate to the application.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe second-stage C&C domain is always the same irrespective of the application or the\ngeolocation of the victim, and the GET request to this server navigates the browser to the\nthird-stage URL. An example of the response can be seen below.\n\nThe third-stage URL displays the final page asking for the victim’s phone number and\nsubscribes to several paid services and premium subscriptions.\n\nThe JavaScript code embedded in the page is responsible for the malicious behavior of the\napplication due to the interaction between the Web and Mobile resources. Some examples\nof the displayed page and the malicious JS codes are shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThere are two variants of the campaign differing by the interaction with the victim:\n\nFirst Variant: Displays a “Continue” or “Click” Button, clicking on which initiates an\nSMS sending action as shown in the above screenshots. This URI is parsed.\n\nExample: “sms:1252?body=TREND frcql1sm”.\nSecond Variant: Requests the victim’s phone number to be entered and registered\nwith the server’s backend. Then the malicious behavior is the same as the first\nvariant.\n\nThe interaction between the WebPage and the in-app functions is facilitated by the\nJavaScript Interface, which allows JavaScript code inside a WebView to trigger actions in\nthe native(application) level code. This can include the collection of data about the device,\nincluding IMEI, and IMSI among others.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The GriftHorse Threat Actors\n\nThe GriftHorse campaign is one of the most widespread campaigns the zLabs threat\nresearch team has witnessed in 2021, attributing its success to the rarely seen combination\nof features:\n\nCompletely undetected and reported by any other AV vendors;\nMore than 200 Trojan applications were used in the campaign;\nSophisticated architecture preventing the investigation of the extent of this campaign;\nand\nNo-Reuse policy to avoid the blocklisting of strings.\n\nThe level of sophistication, use of novel techniques, and determination displayed by the\nthreat actors allowed them to stay undetected for several months.\n\nIn addition to a large number of applications, the distribution of the applications was\nextremely well-planned, spreading their apps across multiple, varied categories, widening\nthe range of potential victims.\n\nThe following chart shows the category distribution of the apps found:\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Victims of GriftHorse Trojan\n\nThe campaign is exceptionally versatile, targeting mobile users from 70+ countries by\nchanging the application’s language and displaying the content according to the current\nuser’s IP address. Based on the collected intel, GriftHorse has infected over 10 million\nvictim’s devices in the last few months.\n\nThe cybercriminal group behind the GriftHorse campaign has built a stable cash flow of illicit\nfunds from these victims, generating millions in recurring revenue each month with the total\namount stolen potentially well into the hundreds of millions. Each of the victims is charged\nover €30 per month, leading to recurring financial loss until they manage to rectify the issue\nby contacting their SIM operator.\n\nThe campaign has been actively under development for several months, starting from\nNovember 2020, and the last updated time dates back to April 2021. This means one of\ntheir first victims, if they have not shut off the scam, has lost more than €200 at the time of\nwriting. The cumulative loss of the victims adds up to a massive profit for the cybercriminal\ngroup.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 21: Heatmap of the over 10 million victims spread across over 70 countries\n\n## Zimperium vs. GriftHorse Android Trojan\n\nZimperium zIPS customers are protected against GriftHorse Trojan with our on-device z9\nMobile Threat Defense machine learning engine.\n\nTo ensure your Android users are protected from GriftHorse Trojan, we recommend a quick\nrisk assessment. Any application with GriftHorse will be flagged as a Suspicious App Threat\non the device and in the zConsole. Admins can also review which apps are sideloaded onto\nthe device that could be increasing the attack surface and leaving data and users at risk.\n\n## Summary of GriftHorse Android Trojan\n\nThe threat actors have exerted substantial effort to maximize their presence in the Android\necosystem through a large number of applications, developer accounts, and domains. The\nZimperium zLab researchers have noticed the technique of abusing cross-platform\ndevelopment frameworks to stay undetected has been on the rise, making it more difficult\nfor legacy mobile AV providers to detect and protect their customers.\n\nThe timeline of the threat group dates back to November 2020, suggesting that their\npatience and persistence will probably not come to an end with the closing down of this\ncampaign. The threat to Android users will always be present, considering the innovative\napproaches used by malicious actors to infect the victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe numerical stats reveal that more than 10 million Android users fell victim to this\ncampaign globally, suffering financial losses while the threat group grew wealthier and\nmotivated with time. And while the victims struggle to get their money back, the\ncybercriminals made off with millions of Euros through this technically novel and effective\nTrojan campaign.\n\n## Indicators of
