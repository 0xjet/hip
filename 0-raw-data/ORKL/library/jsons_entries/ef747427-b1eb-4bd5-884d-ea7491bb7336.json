Lets unravel some infrastructure.\n\n**[silentpush.com/blog/two-men-arrested-for-impersonating-dhs-employees-lets-unravel-some-infrastructure](https://www.silentpush.com/blog/two-men-arrested-for-impersonating-dhs-employees-lets-unravel-some-infrastructure)**\n\nApril 9, 2022\n\nApr 9\n\n\n-----\n\nWritten By [The Team](http://10.10.0.46/blog?author=6081bc3c4920d358398731f8)\n\nResearch by Silent Push research team\n\n[On Wednesday two men were arrested who are alleged to have been impersonating](https://apnews.com/article/us-secret-service-956062f32e02854112b7c52794d202b2)\nFederal agents. 5 witnesses have given evidence that the men pretended to work for\nseveral agencies, with the Department Of Homeland Security being one of them.\n\nAccording to the affidavit that initially sounds bad but not on the very high end of what bad\ncould be.\n\nAt this point one may mistakenly think these guys were just trying to sound sophisticated or\na “Walter Mitty” type of episode that got out of hand. However the allegations quickly\nescalate into very concerning territory.\n\n“Specifically, TAHERZADEH has provided members of the United States Secret Service\n(USSS) and an employee of DHS with, among other things, rent-free apartments (with a\ntotal yearly rent of over $40,000 per apartment), iPhones, surveillance systems, a drone, a\nflat screen television, a case for storing an assault rifle, a generator, and law enforcement\nparaphernalia. TAHERZADEH also offered these individuals use of, what TAHERZADEH\nrepresented to be “official government vehicles.” In addition, TAHERZADEH offered to\npurchase a $2,000 assault rifle for a United Secret Service Agent assigned to the First\nLady’s protective detail. As of April 4, 2022, as a result of this conduct, four members of the\nSecret Service were placed on administrative leave pending further investigation.”\n\n## A harsh job interview\n\n\n-----\n\nThen they are alleged to actually try to recruit someone to work for them under the guise of\nbeing deputized by the DHS. According to the affidavit “As part of the “recruitment process”\nTAHERZADEH and ALI required that the “applicant” be shot with an Airsoft rifle to evaluate\ntheir pain tolerance and reaction. Subsequent to being shot, the applicant was informed that\ntheir hiring was in process. The applicant was also assigned to conduct research on an\nindividual that provided support to the Department of Defense and intelligence community.”\n\nThis ongoing sharade only got uncovered when a United States Postal Inspector was\ninvestigating an assault at the apartment complex where the suspects lived. They were\nwitnesses to the assault but their questioning made the inspector suspicious and they called\nin the FBI.\n\n## The Set Up.\n\nSo what were they doing? Looking into the affidavit they were using an email address with\nthe domain name ussp[.]us. Let’s use this as a starting point and map out their\ninfrastructure and timings.\n\nThey have a corporate LInkedin page set up for this company.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd a Cruchbase profile\n\n\n-----\n\nTheir registered address is 949 1ST St SE APT 509 Washington, DC, 20003-4737 United\nStates. Their website is no longer fully functional but we can still see the urls that were\nhosted there using archive.org.\n\n\n-----\n\nExamples of the urls on the ussp[.]us website\n\nExample of one of the web pages of ussp[.]us\n\n\n-----\n\nInstagram Page of USSP\n\n## Front\n\nThe court documents suggest they were providing apartments rent free to a number of\npeople in the apartment building who have now been suspended from their public service\njobs. The implication is that the suspects were taking advantage of these people for\nnefarious purposes such as espionage. If we look at their infrastructure is there anything we\ncan tell.\n\n## Whois Records\n\nWe found a number of domains for this group. The first being ussp[.]us but also a number fo\nothers on the same custom name server \"a1.ussp.us\", \"a2.ussp.us\".\n\nFor this primary domain the admin is listed as “INFORMATION SYSTEMS”\n\n\n-----\n\nIf we check out the other domains on these name servers.\n\nLet’s get a better look\n\nThe same organization had quite a few ‘special police’ themed domains on the go since\n2020. The costs of this are beginning to mount up.\n\n## What are special police officers?\n\nhttps://mpdc.dc.gov/service/security-snapshot-updates-security-personnel\n\nThis is perhaps the more interesting question about this story. The companies that these\nsuspects had set up were branded as if they provide security contracting as special police\n[officers for the District Of Columbia. These appear to be a special type of private security](http://statewideprotectiveservice.com/site2/dc-faqs/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[contractors who are licensed to make arrests within the area they cover. We don t know if](http://statewideprotectiveservice.com/site2/dc-faqs/)\nthe people in question were licensed or not but all of these domains they were operating are\naround that theme. Is this a case of delusional security guards pretending they were\nsomething “cooler”, or is this something more nefarious as some people are suggesting.\n\n## Prior Behavior\n\n[The suspects in this case seem to have an ongoing track record of irresponsible behavior](https://www.thedailybeast.com/homeland-security-conman-arian-taherzadehs-arrest-is-karma-says-former-friend-from-kansas-city)\nand would not seem to be ideal candidates for any real undercover work or espionage\nactivity, but we’ll see what gets revealed in court.\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10696133/How-fake-DHS-agents-spent-18MONTHS-trying-infiltrate-Secret-Service-Jill-Bidens-detail.html?s=09\n\n## Why these Subdomains?\n\nOne question that would be good to have the answer to is why do certain subdomains exist\nfor this organization. People are assuming the company is a complete front but what if it\nhad contracts and what were they for?\n\nwww.downloads.ussp./us\n\n## TXT Records\n\nWe can tell from their TXT records that they had a logmein account as well as Google\nsearch console and Office 365 for the main domain ussp./us.\n\n\n-----\n\nuspolice./us also had a verification TXT record for Microsoft. So this may also have been\none of their email domains.\n\n## Certificates\n\nThe main domain had some certificates for cpanel and others.\n```\ndate\": 20220330,\n\n    \"domain\": \"ussp.us\",\n\n    \"domains\": [\n\n     \"a1.ussp.us\",\n\n     \"cpanel.a1.ussp.us\",\n\n     \"cpcalendars.a1.ussp.us\",\n\n     \"cpcontacts.a1.ussp.us\",\n\n     \"mail.a1.ussp.us\",\n\n     \"webmail.a1.ussp.us\",\n\n     \"whm.a1.ussp.us\",\n\n     \"www.a1.ussp.us\"\n\"host\": \"a1.ussp.us\",\n\n    \"issuer\": \"cPanel, Inc.
