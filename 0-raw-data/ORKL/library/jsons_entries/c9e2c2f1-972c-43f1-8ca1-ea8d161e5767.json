    "plain_text": "# Kaseya Ransomware Supply Chain Attack: What You Need To Know\n\n**[symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/kaseya-ransomware-supply-chain](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/kaseya-ransomware-supply-chain)**\n\n**UPDATE July 5 2021: Our blog has been updated with more details on how the ransomware**\n_was executed along with additional protection information._\n\nSeveral hundred organizations have been targeted by the REvil (aka Sodinokibi)\nransomware in a supply chain attack involving Kaseya VSA software and multiple Managed\nService Providers (MSPs) who use it. News of the attack broke yesterday (Friday 3 July),\n[prompting Kaseya to urge VSA users to shut down their VSA servers to prevent them from](https://www.kaseya.com/potential-attack-on-kaseya-vsa/)\nbeing compromised. The attack may have been timed to coincide with the 4th of July holiday\nweekend in the U.S., where many organizations may be lightly staffed.\n\n**Are Symantec customers protected?**\n\nYes, Symantec Endpoint products proactively blocked tools used to deliver the ransomware\npayload in this wave of attacks.\n\n**How many organizations are affected?**\n\nAccording to Kaseya only a very small percentage of their customers were affected,\n“currently estimated at fewer than 40 worldwide”. However, each of those organizations may\nbe MSPs with multiple customers. Current reports suggest hundreds of victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n**How was REvil delivered to computers during these attacks?**\n\nWhile the exploit used to breach Kaseya VSA server side has not yet been fully documented,\nit is known that the attackers delivered a malicious script and an ASCII PEM named agent.crt\nto Kaseya VSA clients. The dropper masqueraded inside the ASCII PEM file, which was\ndecoded using certutil after attempts to disable Microsoft Defender. It dropped two\nresources, an old, but legitimate copy of Windows Defender (MsMpEng.exe) and custom\nmalicious loader. The dropper writes the two files to disk and executes MsMpEng.exe which\nthen side loads and executes the custom loader's export (mpsvc.dll).\n\n**What was the motivation for the attacks?**\n\nREvil attacks are usually financially motivated. However, there are some signs that the\nattacks may be politically motivated disruption. The attackers have, on occasion, appeared to\nhave a political motive in their selection of targets.\n\nIn this attack, strings in the payload made references to President Joe Biden, ex-president\nDonald Trump, and Black Lives Matter. The attackers demanded a ransom of $45,000, which\nmay be another reference to Trump, who was the 45th president of the U.S.\n\nFurthermore, REvil’s Tor payment site is down at the time of writing, meaning victims will\nhave no way of paying a ransom. Whether the group is having technical difficulties or\nwhether it never intended to collect a ransom remains unclear.\n\n**What is REvil/Sodinokibi?**\n\nREvil (detected as Ransom.Sodinokibi) is a family of ransomware developed by a\ncybercrime group Symantec calls Leafroller. The ransomware is used in targeted attacks,\nwhere the attackers attempt to encrypt all computers on the victim’s network in the hope of\nextorting a large ransom. The group is known to steal victim data prior to encryption and\nthreaten to release it unless a ransom is paid.\n\nLeafroller is one of the most established and prolific targeted ransomware groups in\noperation. Prior to its development of REvil, the group was associated with an older\nransomware family known as Gandcrab. Leafroller is known to operate a Ransomware-as-aService, where its sells its tools to collaborators known as affiliates in exchange for a cut of\nany ransom payments they obtain.\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\nTools associated with these attacks will be detected and blocked on machines running\nSymantec Endpoint products.\n\n**File-based protection:**\n\n\n-----\n\nDownloader\nHeur.AdvML.C\nPacked.Generic.618\nRansom.Sodinokibi\nTrojan.Gen.2\nTrojan.Gen.MBT\nWS.Malware.1\nWS.Malware.2\n\n**Network-based protection:**\n\nRansom.Gen Activity 29\nAudit: Ransom.Gen Activity 55\n\n[For the latest protection updates, please visit the Symantec Protection Bulletin.](https://www.broadcom.com/support/security-center/protection-bulletin)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nd55f983c994caa160ec63a59f6b4250fe67fb3e8c43a388aec60a4a6978e9f1e - Dropper\n\ndf2d6ef0450660aaae62c429610b964949812df2da1c57646fc29aa51c3f031e - Dropper\n\ndc6b0e8c1e9c113f0364e1c8370060dee3fcbe25b667ddeca7623a95cd21411f - Dropper\n\naae6e388e774180bc3eb96dad5d5bfefd63d0eb7124d68b6991701936801f1c7 - Dropper\n\n66490c59cb9630b53fa3fa7125b5c9511afde38edab4459065938c1974229ca8 - Dropper\n\n81d0c71f8b282076cd93fb6bb5bfd3932422d033109e2c92572fc49e4abc2471 - Dropper\n\n1fe9b489c25bb23b04d9996e8107671edee69bd6f6def2fe7ece38a0fb35f98e - Dropper\n\n8dd620d9aeb35960bb766458c8890ede987c33d239cf730f93fe49d90ae759dd - Sodinokibi\n\ne2a24ab94f865caeacdf2c3ad015f31f23008ac6db8312c2cbfb32e4a5466ea2 - Sodinokibi\n\nd8353cfc5e696d3ae402c7c70565c1e7f31e49bcf74a6e12e5ab044f306b4b20 - Sodinokibi\n\nd5ce6f36a06b0dc8ce8e7e2c9a53e66094c2adfc93cfac61dd09efe9ac45a75f - Sodinokibi\n\ncc0cdc6a3d843e22c98170713abf1d6ae06e8b5e34ed06ac3159adafe85e3bd6 - Sodinokibi\n\n0496ca57e387b10dfdac809de8a4e039f68e8d66535d5d19ec76d39f7d0a4402 - Sodinokibi\n\n8e846ed965bbc0270a6f58c5818e039ef2fb78def4d2bf82348ca786ea0cea4f - Sodinokibi\n\n\n-----",
