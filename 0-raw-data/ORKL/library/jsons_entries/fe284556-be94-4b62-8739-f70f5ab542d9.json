Soon\nafter launching, weaknesses were found in the ransomware that allowed a free decryptor to\nbe released by [Tesorion.](https://www.tesorion.nl/)\n\nThe ransomware operators quickly fixed their bugs and released a new version of the\nransomware under Ranzy Locker name.\n\nWhile the name has changed, strings associated with a PDB debug file in the ransomware\nexecutables still show it is the same as ThunderX.\n```\nC:\\Users\\Gh0St\\Desktop\\ThunderX\\Release\\LockerStub.pdb\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nBleepingComputer s theory is that they rebranded to start with a clean slate and avoid the\nstigma of being associated with the previously released decryptor.\n\n## Meet the Ranzy Locker ransomware\n\n[Using a sample of the ransomware found by MalwareHunterteam and shared with](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\nBleepingComputer, we can get a deeper dive into how the ransomware operates.\n\n[When launched, Ranzy Locker will first clear Shadow Volume Copies so that victims can't](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/why-everyone-should-disable-vssadminexe-now/)\nuse it to recover encrypted files.\n```\nvssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet;\n\n```\nWhen encrypting files, the ransomware will use a Windows API called the 'Windows Restart\nManager' that will terminate processes or Windows services that keep a file open and\nprevent it from being encrypted.\n\n**Windows Restart Manager**\nFor each encrypted file, the ransomware appends the new .ranzy extension to the file's\nname. For example, a file named 1.doc would be encrypted and renamed to 1.doc.ranzy.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ranzy Locker encrypted files**\nIn each traversed folder, the ransomware will create a ransom note named 'readme.txt' that\nincludes information about what happened to a victim's data, a warning that their data was\nstolen, and a link to a Tor site where the victim can negotiate with the threat actors.\n\nIt should be noted that in previous versions of ThunderX, the ransomware operators\ncommunicated with victims via email rather than using a dedicated Tor site.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ranzy Locker ransom note**\nWhen a victim visits the Tor payment site, they will be greeted with a 'Locked by Ranzy\nLocker' message and be shown a live chat screen to negotiate with the threat actors. As part\nof this 'service,' the ransomware operators allow victims to decrypt three files for free to\nprove that they can do so.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ranzy**\n\n**Locker Tor payment site**\n\n## Ranzy Locker launches a data leak site\n\nMany ransomware gangs utilize a double-extortion attack method, which is to steal\nunencrypted files from a victim before they encrypt the devices on the corporate network.\n\nThis attack method provides the threat actors two ways to leverage the victim into paying a\nransomware -- pay to get their files back and not have their data publicly leaked.\n\n[This week, the Ranzy Locker gang released a data leak site called 'Ranzy Leak' to leak the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/list-of-ransomware-that-leaks-victims-stolen-files-if-not-paid/)\ndata of victims who do not pay.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis web site currently includes one victim who develops power control solutions.\n\nAn item of interest is that the Tor onion URL used by the Ranzy Leak site is the same as the\n[one previously used by Ako Ransomware.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-now-demands-extra-payment-to-delete-stolen-files/)\n\nThe use of Ako's URL could indicate that both groups merged to form Ranzy Locker, or they\n[are cooperating similarly as the Maze cartel.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-team-up-to-form-extortion-cartel/)\n\nUpdate 10/16/20: The Ako ransomware operators contacted us and stated ThunderX is part\nof their operation and that they have rebranded to Ranzy Locker.\n\n\"Because we update our original ransomware and its little rebranding.\n\nThunderX is test version our update, but some US kids share this build on virustotal —\noops.\"\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[Snap-on discloses data breach claimed by Conti ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/snap-on-discloses-data-breach-claimed-by-conti-ransomware-gang/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Shutterfly discloses data breach after Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shutterfly-discloses-data-breach-after-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
