Besides well-known events such as\n\n## Cthe attacks against Estonia, Georgia, and Ukraine;\n\nrecent headlines have seen Russian hacking syndicates\ncredited with targeting NATO officials at conferences,\nstealing hundreds of millions from banks, and\nsuccessfully penetrating the White House unclassified\ncomputer network. The increase in cyber-exploits is\nalso accompanied by a much more aggressive Russian\nforeign policy, which has seen them invade Ukraine\nand literally seize control of sovereign territory in\nCrimea. So it should not surprise anyone that just\nas nuclear capable Russian bombers are increasingly\npenetrating foreign airspace, their cyber-warriors\nappear to be ramping up their intrusions as well.\nBut this time, perhaps for the first time, root9B has\nmanaged to find where they were hiding and identified\neffective defenses against their intended attacks. This is\nwhat happened in late April and early May of this year.\n\nOur firm of cybersecurity experts, staffed by\nveterans from the United States Department of\nDefense, identified suspicious activity within one\nof our client’s networks; a threat which on closer\ninspection bore the unique signature of a group of\nRussian hackers well-known in the cyber-security\n\n\nindustry. As Cyber Threat analysts continued to\nfollow the indicators, they uncovered a global\nattack in the making, and took steps to protect not\nonly our clients, but other identified victims as well.\n\nSofacy, Sednit, Sourface, APT-28, and a host of other\nnames are all used to describe this particularly prolific\nand superbly talented group of Russian hackers, which\nhas strongly suspected ties to Russian intelligence\nservices.

With a network defense\nstrategy of pursuit and deterrence in mind, root9B\noperators conduct Active Adversary Pursuit (HUNT)\noperations as a tailored solution for cyber security\nteams. Working in concert with traditional network\ndefense appliances that currently reside in our client’s\nproprietary network, root9B’s HUNT platform delivers\na pro-active defense protection capability to identify,\npursue, and mitigate cyber threats. This approach was\ndeveloped by root9B in order to leverage previously\nexisting security products with client-specific threat\nintelligence and proprietary capabilities that can\nidentify sophisticated vulnerabilities, generate\nactionable intelligence, and install solutions with\nmuch greater speed and efficiency.\n\n#### Winning In Advance\n\nDuring the end of April 2015, root9B analysts were\nconducting routine security analysis to explore and\ndiscover new and emerging cyber threats. Threat\nAnalysts discovered what appeared to be a targeted\nspearfishing domain aimed at a financial institution.\nThe server it was found on raised even more\nquestions, because although security experts knew\nthe server as a bad actor, it was generally associated\nwith malware used in nation state attacks. As analysts\ncontinued their work they discovered several more\npieces of new malware. The malicious code bore\nspecific signatures that have historically been unique\nto only one organization, Sofacy. This malware\n\n\nwas pointing at a spearfishing domain registered to\nimpersonate a Middle Eastern financial institution\nand the domain registration details did not match\nnormal Sofacy operational signatures. That said, the\nmalicious software certainly did. Members of root9B’s\noperations team conducted HUNT operations,\nremotely deploying their live memory capability across\nthe clients proprietary networks to analyze known\ntechniques that can evade the most efficient security\nproducts on the market. root9B’s capability parses live\nmemory while the system is running and looks for\nindicators of advanced tactics such as code injection\nor security product bypassing. Using a combination\nof standard industry tools and proprietary techniques\nour analysts began to develop a larger picture of what\nwas taking place. Immediately, root9B identified that\npreparations were being made for a larger scale attack\nsimilar to previous Sofacy attributed exploits, and\nthe attack was still in the preparatory stages. To our\nanalysts, this was a rare opportunity. “It is rare enough\nto learn of an attack of this potential magnitude in\nadvance, but to have all of the information necessary\nto stop it before it begins is unprecedented,“ said an\nunnamed root9B analyst.\n\nEvidence of intrusion within client networks pointed\nto a specific server, CARBON2U.COM, that had been\npreviously linked to malicious activity and identified\nby other security firms as part of the infrastructure\nutilized by the Sofacy group. Analysts studied the\nremaining domains registered on that server, and\ninitially noted that one in particular, CBIUAEBANK.\n\n\n-----\n\nMay 10, 2015\n\nCOM, appeared to be a fake version of CBIUAE.COM,\nthe actual domain of the website of Commercial\nBank International of the United Arab Emirates.\nFurther analysis lead to even more suspicion, and\nthose suspicions grew even stronger as they watched\nanother comparable domain created, CBIUAEBN.\nCOM. As analysts passively monitored CARBON2U.\nCOM, they observed as the apparent fake domains\nthey were monitoring migrated to other servers; first\nto SITE4NOW.NET and later to OK2HOST.COM.\nThis gave analysts two more suspicious servers to\nstudy, and added considerable data analysis.\n\nroot9B analysts began to dissect the data at hand to\nidentify common tactics, techniques, and procedures\nused by the adversaries which could provide further\ninformation about the planned hack, including\ninformation about potential attack vectors. As\nroot9B analyzed increasing amounts of metadata\nand associated indicators, they were able to identify\na very unique signature consistently used by someone\ninvolved in setting up the hack. Investigating the\n\n\nroot9B: The Threat Defiance Report\n\napparently fictitious list of personas used to create\nand register domains, a pattern emerged. Due to\nthe nature of this unique signature, root9B is in the\nprocess of further documenting and reporting to the\nproper authorities.\n\nThe discovery of the hacker’s single mistake in\ntradecraft was indeed a powerful catalyst, and lead\nto the discovery of a treasure trove of new indicators.\nThe new discoveries included evidence related to past\nattempts to launch attacks against many of the same\ntargets, including the aforementioned Commercial\nBank International. What the analysts eventually\nhad was a very detailed view of the specific tactics\nemployed by this adversary; and a window into a\nplan for a hack that was even larger than originally\nbelieved, much larger. Where initially they had only\na single fake domain pointed at CBI, now there were\nsix additional domains, all used to target this single\nvictim. Many of the fake domains appeared to have\nbeen created by several of the same accounts, and open\nsource analysis indicated that the names listed for the\n\n\n-----\n\nMay 10, 2015\n\nperson registering the addresses was clearly fictitious;\nprobably chosen at random from the Internet.\n\nThe analysts at root9B understand better than anyone\nthe significance of this analysis. As far as any of them\nknow, and it stands to reason that they would, there\nhas never been a case of a large-scale attack utilizing\nnumerous zero-day exploits that were so thoroughly\nmapped in advance before. The analysts who worked\nthis case now understand that the attackers began\npreparations for this campaign in June 2014, a full\neleven months ago. The design of the hack bears\nstriking similarity to the very exploits that have made\nSofacy so feared and respected. At least nine months\nof meticulous preparation coupled with one slip of\ntradecraft has enabled root9B to inform potential\ntargets prior to the execution of the strategy.\n\nWith the exception of CBIUAEONLINE.COM, there\nare numerous consistencies amongst the tactics\nemployed by the hackers. The group generates what\nare likely fictitious personalities as the “owners”\nof each of the fake domains. All of the fictitious\npersonalities list the same street address. While they\nchange names and house numbers for them, they all\nreside on Cloverdale Lane in DeSoto, Texas. Analysts\nnoting the similarity did not have to visit the street\nto determine that it was unlikely that they each\nresided in different homes on the same street. In\nfact, even the house numbers changed only slightly\nfrom one domain to the other. In addition to the\nlinks between the addresses, streets, and names, they\nfound that the registrant phone numbers were also\nvery closely related. The only differences in registrant\ndata from one domain to the next involved very slight\nmodifications to the country codes or by changing the\nthird digit. This kind of flaw in tradecraft allowed for\nfurther detailed network analysis.\n\nFurther analysis of the street addresses enabled\nroot9B to correlate the address and personas listed as\nregistrants via public records, doing so showed that\nmost of these addresses did not even exist, and the\nfew addresses confirmed to physically exist did not\nhave residents with the names listed. This became a\n\n\nroot9B: The Threat Defiance Report\n\nkey signature of the hackers; a common thread which\nunraveled all of Sofacy’s careful preparation. Often\nthose wanting to generate a free and anonymous email\naddress will use a false name and address in order to\nconceal and preserve their true identity.\n\nThe information below dictates open source research\non the adversary’s creation of domains. As previously\nnoted, root9B is in the process of further documenting\nand reporting probable fictitious personas to the\nauthorities.\n\nDOMAIN: CBIBUAE.COM\n\n    - Created: 2014-06-14\n\n    - Nameserver: nvhserver.com\n\nDOMAIN: CBIUAEONLINE.COM\n\n    - Created: 2014-06-24\n\n    - Updated: 2014-07-03\n\n    - ameserver:aspnix.com\n(suspended-domain)\n\nDOMAIN: ROYALBSUK.COM\n\n    - Created: 2014-07-02\n\n    - Updated: 2014-07-06\n\n    - Nameserver: (suspended-domain)\n\n\n-----\n\nMay 10, 2015\n\nDOMAIN: CIBUAEONLINE.COM\n\n    - Created: 2014-11-27\n\n    - Updated: 2014-01-27\n\n    - Nameserver: hostzeal.com\n\nDOMAIN: CIBUAEONLINEBN.COM\n\n    - Created: 2014-11-28\n\n    - Updated: 2014-01-27\n\n    - Nameserver: site4now.net\n\nDOMAIN: CBIUAEONLINE.COM\n\n    - Created: 2014-12-10\n\n    - Updated: 2014-02-08\n\n    - Nameserver: ok2host.com\n\nDOMAIN: CBIUAEBANK.COM\n\n    - Created: 2015-04-29\n\n    - Updated: 2015-05-02\n\n    - Nameserver: site4now.net\n\nDOMAIN: CBIUAEBN.COM\n\n    - Created: 2015-04-29\n\n    - Updated: 2015-05-03\n\n    - ameserver: ok2host.com\n\nCorrelating the increasing amounts of information,\nroot9B analysts have determined that the adversary\nresponsible for the initial attack in June 2014 was\nalmost certainly the same, or very closely-related to\nthe entity responsible for creating at least two of the\ndomains in April 2015. The same person was ostensibly\nresponsible for registering the two most recent\ndomains (CBIUAEBN.COM and CBIUAEBANK.\nCOM). Analysts from root9B now believe that the\nadversary most likely selected this name through\nan internet search, and that these personas, while\npossibly real names, are not the true names of those\nindividuals associated with the preparations for this\nattack.\n\nroot9B analysts have also identified an additional\npersona; one that did not appear to directly relate to\nthis attack against CBI UAE Bank, but that carried\nsimilar operational tactics to include comparable\nstreet address schemes and the registration of\n\n\nroot9B: The Threat Defiance Report\n\ndomains closely resembling financial institutions.\nBy studying the new persona, root9B discovered\nthey had previously created several domains and\nwebsites, all of which have been flagged as Fake\nFinancial Institutions by security analysts. Also\nidentified during this analysis, was the prepositioning\nof a domain targeting the financial institution B-OFAMERIC.COM, created in April 2015. This indicates\nthat Bank of America, is among the probable targets.\n\nThis same individual has registered numerous other\nfake domains on many more name servers. One of\nthese name servers, BULKBREAKERS.COM, contains\nseveral other international financial institutions. One\nof those domains, T-D-CANADATRUST.COM, was\nupdated on 23 March 2015, and appears to be targeting\nToronto Dominion (TD) Canada Trust. Among the\napparent targets of other domains similarly created\nor updated in 2015 are: the United Nations, United\nNations Children’s Fund, United Bank for Africa,\nRegions Bank, and possibly Commerzbank.\n\n#### Results\n\nWhile root9B’s discovery began with servicing\ntheir own customers, their analysis has revealed an\nadversary pattern that has enabled the identification\nof previously unknown target vectors. As root9B\nanalysts continued to peel back the layers, it became\nmore apparent, that this attack was likely associated\nwith Russian intelligence. The targets included\nmultiple major financial institutions, as well as the\ninternational government domain. In addition to\nidentifying targets, root9B analysts also discovered\nindicators of malware, the analysis of which revealed\nseveral zero-day threats and their corresponding\n“hashes.” Each new discovery revealed more\ninformation, enabling a more complete picture to\nemerge. root9B discovered and analyzed numerous\nother domains being staged or recently created for\nthe malicious cyber operation. Also discovered was a\nfatal flaw in the hackers tradecraft that lead to a major\nbreakthrough. Research based on the adversary’s flaw\nin tactics showed that there was a strong likelihood of\ntwo distinct subgroups, each of which utilized unique\n\n\n-----\n\nMay 10, 2015\n\nmethods of cover for their activity. Each of the two\ngroups also had a unique theme to their target sets.\nThe first seemed to focus on military, diplomatic,\nand media targets, and relied on the cover of proxies\nand private domain registrations. As documented\nearlier, the other group used deliberately falsified\npersonalities, all of which claimed to be American\ncitizens, and focused on financial and banking targets.\nUnderstanding the scope of the newly staged malicious\noperations, root9B also tipped the information to the\nappropriate international and domestic government\nauthorities.\n\nWhile the continued vector of the attack remains\nunclear, root9B assesses that it will most likely be a\nspear-phishing campaign. This attack vector will likely\nuse a well-crafted email containing either a malicious\nfile or web hyperlink to what recipients believe is the\nactual website; but is instead a fake landing page.\nIn typical attacks of this nature, once users navigate\nto the link, visitors are prompted to supply account\ncredentials and personal information under the false\nassumption that they are communicating with their\nbank via a secure link. However, it is possible, that the\nSofacy group could utilize this server as a vector to\ndeliver malicious code to the banking victims in an\nattempt to obtain access to the network. As of October\n2014, the Symantec Corporation had reported an\nincreased use of spear-phishing emails containing\nmalware specifically targeted against financial\ninstitutions.\n\n\nroot9B: The Threat Defiance Report\n\nAccording to their conclusions, root9B analysts expect\nthat spear-phishing attacks will begin in the near\nfuture, or may have already commenced. As root9B\ncontinues to work with authorities it is recommended\nthat the aforementioned financial institutions take\ncaution examining any and all correspondence. In\naddition, it is recommended that networks begin\nblocking the following hashes and communications\nwith the identified Command and Control (C2)\nserver:\n\nMalware SHA1 Hash\n\n0450aaf8ed309ca6baf303837701b5b23aac6f05\n\nbb909d9c27a509bf97cdc85268556ff5a6d2550a\n\nf325970fd24bb088f1befdae5788152329e26bf3\n\na351842ee01374d66bae35354ffe72f0b1b8a40b\n\nCommand and Control (C2) Server:\n\n176.31.112.10\n\n\n-----\n\nMay 10, 2015 root9B: The Threat Defiance Report\n\nInteresting samples of over 250 identified malicious\ndomains*:\n\nb-of-americ.com\nosce-military.org\nbbcnewsweek.com\nqov.hu.com\nsettings-yahoo.com\nyovtube.co\ngooglesetting.com\ncbiuaebn.com\ncbiuaebank.com\ntechcruncln.com\nun-unicef.org\nroyalbsuk.com\nkwqx.us\nmiddle-eastreview.org\nunitednat.org\nfbonlinelottery.com\nfubnt.com\nglobeshippers.biz\nglobeshippers.net\ngsandsc.com\ngshippers.com\nhesselawchambers.com\nlargefarm.net\nregionsbnk.info\nseatreasures.org\nssandsc.com\nt-d-canadatrust.com\ntechielawfirms.com\ntogounoffice.com\nubagroupsgh.com\nun-unicef.org\nunicomba.com\nuniversalcoba.com\n\n*Some domains may have been previously reported\nas associated with the Sofacy Group.
