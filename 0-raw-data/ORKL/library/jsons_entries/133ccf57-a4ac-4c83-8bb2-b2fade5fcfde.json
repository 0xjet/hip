We believe the threat**\n\n**originates from Iran.**\n\n**Below you will find key details related to this disclosure. A full copy of the iSIGHT Partners report is available�**\n\n**[upon request by registering here.](http://info.isightpartners.com/newscaster-iranian-threat-within-social-networks)**\n\n**For any media related inquires on the NEWSCASTER Threat please contact Adrienne Reitz,**\n\n**[newscaster@okco.com](mailto:newscaster@okco.com)**\n\n## Here is what you need to know…\n\n**WHAT IS THE NEWS?**\n\n**iSIGHT Partners believes Iranian threat actors are using more than a dozen fake personas on social networking**\n\n**sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, YouTube, Blogger) in a coordinated, long-term cyber espionage**\n\n**campaign. At least 2,000 people/targets are, or have been, caught in the snare and are connected to the false**\n\n**personas.**\n\n**This campaign, working undetected since 2011, targets senior U.S. military and diplomatic personnel,**\n\n**congressional personnel, Washington D.C. area journalists, U.S. think tanks, defense contractors in the U.S.**\n\n**and Israel, as well as others who are vocal supporters of Israel to covertly obtain log-in credentials to the email**\n\n**systems of their victims. Additional victims in the U.K. as well as Saudi Arabia and Iraq were targeted.**\n\n**The targeting, operational schedule, and infrastructure used in this campaign is consistent with Iranian origins.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**elaborate and have created credibility using, among other tactics, a fictitious journalism website,�**\n\n**newsonair.org, that plagiarizes news content from other legitimate media outlets.**\n\n**These credible personas then connected, linked, followed, and “friended” target victims, giving them access to**\n\n**information on location, activities, and relationships from updates and other common content.**\n\n**Accounts were then targeted with “spear-phishing” messages. Links which appeared to be legitimate asked**\n\n**recipients to log-in to false pages, thus capturing credential information. It is not clear at this time how many**\n\n**credentials the attack has captured to date.**\n\n**Additionally, this campaign is linked to malware. While the malware is not particularly sophisticated it includes**\n\n**capability that can be used for data exfiltration.�**\n\n**WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?**\n\n**The discovery and investigation of the attack reveals three critical insights:**\n\n**1. Social media offers a powerful and covert pathway for targeting key government and industry leadership**\n\n**through a third-party platform potentially outside of existing security measures.**\n\n**2. Given targeting associated with this campaign, Iranian actors may have used accesses gained through**\n\n**this activity to support the development of weapon systems, provide insight into the disposition of the U.S.**\n\n**military or the U.S. alliance with Israel, or impart an advantage in negotiations between Iran and the U.S.**\n\n**Furthermore, it is possible that any access or knowledge could be used as reconnaissance-for-attack in**\n\n**advance of disruptive or destructive activity.**\n\n**3. Adversaries such as these are increasingly adept at finding and exploiting opportunities to carry out cyber�**\n\n**espionage, even when lacking sophisticated capability. NEWSCASTER’s success is largely due to its**\n\n**patience, brazen nature, and innovative use of multiple social media platforms.**\n\n**WHAT KIND OF DATA WAS TAKEN?**\n\n**We are unable to say with complete visibility. However, it is reasonable to assume that a vast amount of social**\n\n**content was compromised in addition to some number of log-in credentials that can be used to access additional**\n\n**systems and information.**\n\n**As users often maintain the same credentials for multiple sites, it is impossible to determine the scope, scale,**\n\n**and duration of data loss.**\n\n**WHO SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT THIS THREAT?**\n\n**Given the covert nature of cyber espionage, its impacts are often difficult to forecast or measure; however, in�**\n\n**this instance, we expect any access obtained by the NEWSCASTER network will be ultimately exploited for**\n\n**intelligence value.**\n\n**We infer, from our limited knowledge of NEWSCASTER targeting, that such intelligence could ultimately support**\n\n**the development of weapon systems, provide insight into the disposition of the U.S. military or the U.S. alliance**\n\n**with Israel, or impart an advantage in negotiations between Iran and the U.S., especially with regards to**\n\n**sanctions and proliferation issues.**\n\n**It is also possible that the compromise of such high-ranking and influential people could be used to access the�**\n\n**senior levels of as-of-yet unidentified organizations in the U.S., Israel, and elsewhere. Furthermore, we surmise�**\n\n**that access could be leveraged as reconnaissance-for-attack, supporting eventual disruptive or destructive**\n\n\n-----\n\n**attacks on Saudi Aramco underscore this possibility.**\n\n**The NEWSCASTER network appears to be primarily focused on targeting senior military and policymakers,**\n\n**firms associated with defense technology, and the U.S.-Israel lobby, however, we found victims in the financial�**\n\n**and energy sectors, as well as elsewhere, and we recognize that we could only see a portion of the accounts**\n\n**connected to this network. Organizations involved in critical infrastructure, or who have information that may be**\n\n**of strategic or tactical interest to a nation-state adversary should be concerned about a threat such as this.**\n\n**WHY DOES ISIGHT PARTNERS THINK THIS ORIGINATES IN IRAN?**\n\n**Though the timing of the social network attack may seem irregular at first, over multiple years the schedule�**\n\n**behind the activity becomes apparent. They maintained a regular schedule, including what appears to be a**\n\n**lengthy lunch break followed by the remainder of the work day. These hours conform to work hours in Tehran.**\n\n**Furthermore, the operators work half the day on Thursday and rarely work on Friday, the Iranian weekend.**\n\n**Other clues, such as the targets on which the operators have chosen to focus and additional technical**\n\n**indicators, lead us to believe NEWSCASTER originates in Iran.**\n\n**WHAT IS THE NEWSCASTER NETWORK AFTER?**\n\n**Without seeing how the information stolen by the NEWSCASTER network is used, it is difficult to make a�**\n\n**definitive assessment of their ultimate motivation. However, the actors have intimated their interest in specific�**\n\n**defense technology as well as military and diplomatic information by their targeting. This type of targeting is**\n\n**inconsistent with cyber-criminal behavior.**\n\n**It remains possible that the actors could selectively reveal information gained through this campaign to**\n\n**embarrass those who were targeted, or already have, but we have seen no evidence of this at this time.**\n\n**Ultimately, we believe the sponsors of the activity are seeking information advantage over rival military forces,**\n\n**defense industries, diplomats, and others.**\n\n**IS THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY COMMON ON SOCIAL NETWORKS?**\n\n**We have previously identified cyber espionage campaigns which originate from China using social network�**\n\n**accounts to propagate, but never a campaign of such complexity working across so many platforms.**\n\n**NEWSCASTER is unprecedented in complexity, scale, and longevity.**\n\n**HOW DID ISIGHT PARTNERS UNCOVER THIS ACTIVITY?**\n\n**We are protective of sources and methods, but we can confirm that these actors did not go unnoticed by some�**\n\n**targeted entities and they left significant evidence of their activity throughout the Internet. As with many other�**\n\n**threats, iSIGHT Partners combined malware analysis, open source research, and research from our global**\n\n**collection network to create our assessment of the NEWSCASTER network.**\n\n**IS NEWSONAIR.COM ALSO PART OF THE FAKE NEWS RUSE?**\n\n**Newsonair.COM, a legitimate Indian news operation, is not the same as newsonair.ORG. We have no indication**\n\n**that newsonair.COM was in anyway linked to faux newsonair.ORG site that was part of this campaign.**\n\n**IS THIS THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN?**\n\n**We can’t be certain. We have no information implicating the ultimate sponsor. In the past we’ve seen cyber**\n\n**espionage operations carried out by government organizations, corporate intermediaries, and other third parties.**\n\n**WHAT STEP CAN AN ENTERPRISE TAKE TO PROTECT ITSELF?**\n\n**In addition to blocking known NEWSCASTER infrastructure, an enterprise can protect itself by taking steps to**\n\n**iti** **t** **th** **h** **l** **t** **f th** **NEWSCASTER th** **t** **Th** **h th** **t** **t** **k** **i** **t** **t** **l**\n\n\n-----\n\n**learn from these mistakes to better recognize similar incidents.**\n\n**NEWSCASTER was brazen, complex multi-year cyber-espionage that used a low-tech approach to avoid**\n\n**traditional security defenses​–exploiting social media and people who are often the “weakest link” in the security**\n\n**chain. This underscores the importance of cyber threat intelligence that enables enterprises to proactively tune**\n\n**defenses to combat a determined and persistent adversary utilizing constantly evolving tactics.**\n\n**WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC?**\n\n**Don’t be worried, but do be vigilant. As always, do not create trusted connections with unknown organizations**\n\n**and/or individuals. Never provide login credentials with any site or person who contacts to you (rather than you**\n\n**contacting it), use strong passwords and regularly change them.**\n\n**HAVE YOU COORDINATED WITH THE FBI ON THIS REPORT?**\n\n**The intelligence development and analysis was completed independently by iSIGHT Partners.**\n\n**iSIGHT Partners did coordinate with the FBI to:**\n\n**Brief government agencies and our commercial clients**\n\n**Coordinate on the release of the report**\n\n**Identify the relevance/possible impact of the threat to critical infrastructure entities and agencies**\n\n**WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC?**\n\n**The complexity, scale, and longevity of this campaign leads us to believe that there may be additional victims**\n\n**that do not yet realize they are at risk. We hope that by making this information public, we can deter further**\n\n**incidents. If you determine you are a victim, immediately contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation at either**\n\n**your local FBI Cyber Task Force or FBI CYWATCH (email: cywatch@ic.fbi.gov or phone: +1-855-292-3937)**\n\n**WHO IS ISIGHT PARTNERS?**\n\n**Dallas-based iSIGHT Partners is a global cyber intelligence firm that delivers cyber threat intelligence and�**\n\n**insight to leading enterprises in business and government.
