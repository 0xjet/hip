Those attacks included a\ndenial of service attack against the website of South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\nwhich the South Korean government says originated from China.\n\nFireEye's director of cyber-espionage analysis John Hultquist told the _Wall Street_\n_Journal that FireEye had detected a surge in attacks against South Korean targets from_\nChina since February, when South Korea announced it would deploy THAAD in response to\nNorth Korean missile tests. The espionage attempts have focused on organizations\nassociated with the THAAD deployment. They have included \"spear-phishing\" e-mails\n\n\n-----\n\ncarrying attachments loaded with malware along with watering hole attacks that put exploit\ncode to download malware onto websites frequented by military, government, and defense\nindustry officials.\n\nFireEye claims to have found evidence that the attacks were staged by two groups\nconnected to the Chinese military. One, dubbed Tonto Team by FireEye, operates from the\nsame region of China as previous North Korean hacking operations. The other is known\namong threat researchers as APT10, or \"Stone Panda\"—the same group believed to be\n[behind recent espionage efforts against US companies lobbying the Trump administration on](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/04/researchers-find-china-tried-infiltrating-companies-lobbying-trump-on-trade/)\nglobal trade. These groups have also been joined in attacks by two \"patriotic hacking\" groups\nnot directly tied to the Chinese government, Hultquist told the Journal—including one calling\nitself \"Denounce Lotte Group\" targeting the South Korean conglomerate Lotte. Lotte made\nthe THAAD deployment possible through a land swap with the South Korean government.\n\n\n-----",
