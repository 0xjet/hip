    "plain_text": "### Threat Insights Report\n\n###### Q1 - 2022\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Threat Landscape\n\n##### Welcome to the Q1 2022 edition of the HP Wolf Security Threat Insights Report\n\n#### Notable Threats\n\n##### “Two for one” malware campaign leads to multiple remote access Trojan (RAT) infections\n\n\nEach quarter our security experts highlight notable\nmalware campaigns, trends and techniques identified by\nHP Wolf Security. By isolating threats that have evaded\ndetection tools and made it to endpoints, HP Wolf\nSecurity gives an insight into the latest techniques being\nused by cybercriminals, equipping security teams with\nthe knowledge to combat emerging threats and improve\ntheir security postures.1\n\nAt the end of February 2021, the HP threat research team\nidentified a malware campaign that leads to multiple\nRAT infections on the same device. The attackers spread\nthe malware by email using malicious Visual Basic script\nattachments, triggering the infection chain when\nopened. Two obfuscated PowerShell commands run,\nboth of which download and run additional scripts from\nthe web.\n\n\nFigure 1 - Infection chain leading to different malware families\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Threats unknown by hash when isolated by HP Wolf Security\n# 9%\n\n#### Hours on average before threats isolated by HP Wolf Security were known by hash to other security tools\n# 79\n\n\n“ProgramData” directory. The executable is a legitimate\nsigned program called VbsEdit Script Launcher. Once\nthe PowerShell script runs this file, the manifest is\nloaded and executed from the same folder, ultimately\nlaunching a RAT called Vw0rm (Vengeance Worm).2 This\nexecution ends the first branch of the infection chain.\n\nThe second PowerShell command downloads and runs\nanother script from the web. This script checks if Avast\nanti-virus is installed on the infected system. If this is the\ncase, it downloads and runs another PowerShell script,\neventually running an .exe and .dll containing NjRAT\nmalware.3 If this anti-virus product is not installed, the\nscript downloads and runs an .exe and .dll containing\nAsyncRAT.4 The result is that the victim’s PC is infected\nwith Vw0rm and NjRat or AsyncRAT.\n\nIn this campaign, the attacker used VbsEdit Script\nLauncher to proxy the execution of Vw0rm through a\ntrusted process (T1127), thereby bypassing application\nallowlisting defenses on the PC and avoiding the\nexecution of “noisy” processes like wscript.exe and\ncscript.exe that are commonly monitored by security\ntools and Microsoft’s Antimalware Scanning Interface\n(AMSI).5 Network defenders not only need to keep a\nclose eye on living-off-the-land binaries and scripts, but\nalso third-party development utilities that attackers can\nuse to run malicious code.6\n\nFigure 2 - Visual Basic script that downloads secondary\nscripts from the web\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Mekotio banker smuggled in HTML files to Latin American banking customers\n\nIn March, HP Wolf Security detected a malware\ncampaign delivering Mekotio, a banking Trojan, used by\nthreat actors to target online banking customers in Latin\nAmerica.7 The attackers targeted Portuguese speakers\nwith lures that purported to be parcel collection\nnotifications from a courier company. To bypass email\ngateway security, they used a technique called HTML\nsmuggling (T1027.006).8 The malware steals online\nbanking credentials and other financial data from its\nvictims.\n\n\nDouble-clicking the HTML attachment opens the file in a\nweb browser, where the user is prompted to download a\n.zip archive. The archive contains a Windows Installer file\n(MSI), which unpacks and starts an .exe when executed.\nAnalyzing the executable’s resource section reveals an\nAutoHotKey script, a popular scripting language used to\nautomate tasks in Windows.9\n\n\nFigure 3 - Overview of Mekotio infection chain, March 2022\n\n\nThe executable runs the AutoHotKey script, which makes\nan HTTP request to ipinfo[.]io. The response contains\ninformation that geolocates the public IP address of the\ninfected PC. Since Mekotio targets victims in Latin\nAmerican countries, the script aborts if the victim’s IP\naddress is outside of Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, or\nArgentina. If the victim is in one of the targeted locations,\nthe malware downloads and extracts a .zip archive\ncontaining a .dll and an .exe file. These files are written\ninto a folder and then the .dll is renamed to shfolder.dll,\nthe name of a legitimate Windows library.\n\n\nThe executable, vmnat.exe, is a legitimate file used by\nVMware Workstation, a desktop hypervisor. To run the\n.dll, the malware relies on DLL search order hijacking\n(T1574.001).10 Running vmnat.exe causes it to load the .dll\ncontaining Mekotio instead of the legitimate shfolder.dll\nlibrary. This campaign shows how attackers chain\noffensive techniques together to deliver their malicious\npayloads unnoticed.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### gg p Publisher malware to deliver RATs\n\nWhile attackers prefer Office formats like Excel, Word,\nand PowerPoint to distribute malware, attackers\noccasionally experiment with less popular formats too.\nIn February, HP Wolf Security detected a malware\ncampaign that used Microsoft Publisher (.pub) files to\ntrick victims - a format we seldom see being abused.\n\n\nThe attackers sent malicious .pub email attachments to\nrecipients pretending to be financial documents,\nmentioning keywords such as “payroll”, “order”,\n“purchase”, “inquiry” and “invoice” in the subject lines\nand file names. The attackers used obfuscated Visual\nBasic for Applications (VBA) macros that run when the\nuser closes the document.\n\n\nFigure 4 - Microsoft Publisher file containing a malicious VBA macro\n\n\nThe macros assemble a URL and then opens it with\nmshta.exe (T1218.005), a legitimate utility used to run\nMicrosoft HTML Applications (.hta) files.11 The utility runs\nJavaScript and Visual Basic code hosted on a web page.\nThe code downloads secondary malware by compiling a\nPowerShell script over several steps and running it. Next,\nthis script executes a .NET binary, which downloads and\nlaunches the malware payload from the web. Attackers\nused this campaign to spread Formbook and Agent\nTesla information-stealing malware.12 13\n\n\nWe found large overlaps in the tactics, techniques and\nprocedures (TTPs) of this campaign and another that\nspread Agent Telsa in November 2021, attributed to a\nthreat group called Aggah.14 In that campaign, the VBA\nmacros were embedded in PowerPoint (.ppa and .ppam)\npresentations and sent to targets by email. The code\nused in both campaigns strongly resemble each other.\nThe shared TTPs suggests that this latest campaign also\noriginated from Aggah.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### a a e so ated by o Secu ty that used Office file formats\n# 45%\n\n##### PDF malware is not yet dead\n\n\nIn March, HP Wolf Security detected a malware\ncampaign spreading Snake Keylogger, delivered in PDF\ndocuments.15 After opening the PDF email attachment,\nthe user is shown a prompt asking them to allow another\nfile to be opened. The attackers named the second file\n“has been verified. However PDF, Jpeg, xlsx, .docx” to\nmake it appear as though the file name was part of a\nprompt from Adobe Reader.\n\n\nThe second file is a Word document stored as an\n“EmbeddedFile” in the PDF file. If the user clicks OK to the\nprompt, the document opens in Microsoft Word,\nconnects to a URL, then loads an external object linking\nand embedding (OLE) object. The object contains exploit\ncode that takes advantage of CVE-2017-11882, a\nvulnerability in Microsoft Equation Editor, ultimately\ninfecting the PC with Snake Keylogger.16\n\n\nFigures 5 & 6 - Prompt shown to user when opening the PDF document (left) and OLE object containing exploit (right)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Fake Windows 11 upgrade website spreads Redline Stealer\n\nThreat actors are always looking for topical lures to\nsocially engineer victims into infecting systems. Shortly\nafter an announcement about Windows 11 in January, a\nmalicious actor registered the domain windowsupgraded[.]com, which they used to spread malware by\ntricking users into downloading and running a fake\ninstaller. The domain caught our attention because it\nwas newly registered, imitated a legitimate brand and\ntook advantage of a recent announcement. The threat\nactor used this domain to distribute RedLine Stealer, an\ninformation-stealing malware family that is widely\nadvertised for sale within underground forums.17\n\n\nWe tracked a similar campaign in December 2021.18 Back\nthen, the threat actor registered discrodappp[.]com,\nwhich they used to serve RedLine Stealer disguised as\nan installer for the popular messaging app. In both\ncampaigns, the attacker used fake websites to mimic\npopular software to trick users into installing their\nmalware, registered the domains using the same domain\nregistrar, used the same DNS servers, and delivered the\nsame malware family. This campaign highlights how\nattackers are quick to take advantage of important,\nrelevant and interesting current events to create\neffective lures.\n\n\nFigure 7 - Fake Windows website registered by attackers to serve malware\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Malware campaigns targeting African banking sector\n\nThe top motivation behind cybercrime is financial\nenrichment, and the financial services industry is an\nattractive target for cybercriminals. In early 2022, HP\nWolf Security isolated a targeted malware campaign\nagainst an employee of a West African bank.19 The user\nreceived an email purporting to be from a recruiter from\nanother African bank with information about job\nopportunities there. The campaign caught our attention\nbecause of its targeted nature and how the threat actor\nattempted to deliver malware using HTML smuggling.\n\n\nThe attackers registered at least one domain mimicking\na legitimate bank. One of the domains displayed a web\npage about the bank’s employment application process,\nwhich was likely copied from the legitimate\norganization’s website.\n\nOpening the HTML file prompts the victim to download\nan .iso archive, which in turn contains a Visual Basic\nscript. The script delivers GuLoader malware, which is\nexecuted using PowerShell code stored the Registry and\nis otherwise only run in memory.20\n\n\nFigure 8 - Fake banking website registered by attackers\n\n\n-----\n\n##### targeting Japanese organizations\n#### Notable Trends\n\n\n#### Rise in Emotet samples isolated over previous quarter\n# 28x\n\n#### Top exploited vulnerabilities\n\n\nEmotet, once described by Europol as the most\ndangerous malware in the world, was largely inactive\nfrom January to October 2021.21 However from October,\nthe malware started being delivered as a secondary\npayload after a PC is infected with TrickBot malware.22 In\nlate February 2022, HP Wolf Security detected a surge in\nEmotet email spam, representing a 28-fold (2,823%)\nincrease in sightings in Q1 2022 compared to the\nprevious quarter.\n\nThe malware rose 36 places to become the most\npopular family in circulation, behind Agent Tesla and\nNemucod. The campaigns primarily targeted Japanese\norganizations through malicious Excel spreadsheets\n(.xlsm). HP Wolf Security detected a 23% increase in\nspreadsheet threats over last quarter, partially driven by\ngrowing Emotet activity.\n\nEmotet’s operators have automated the creation of\nspearphishing lures, using a technique called email\nthread hijacking to trick recipients into infecting their\nPCs. By exfiltrating victims’ email mailboxes, the botnet\nspoofs sender addresses, subject lines, attachment file\nnames and the body text of emails. This stolen data is\nused to craft convincing emails that are sent as replies\nto existing email threads, with the goal of tricking targets\ninto opening malicious email attachments and links.\n\n##### JavaScript and Java-based malware on the rise\n\nIn Q1 2022, HP Wolf Security detected a rise in Java and\nJavaScript malware. Java archive threats (.jar) saw a\n476% increase over the previous quarter, while\nJavaScript malware saw a 42% increase in the same\nperiod.\n\n##### Microsoft Office remains most targeted application for exploits\n\nThe top three exploited vulnerabilities isolated by HP\nWolf Security in Q1 2022 all targeted Office applications.\nThere was a 5% increase in CVE-2017-11882 exploits from\nlast quarter, a modest 3% increase in CVE-2018-0802\nexploits, and a 7% drop in CVE-2017-0199 exploits.23 24\n\n\n-----\n\n#### p p vectors types\n## 69%\n\nEmail\n## 18%\n\nWeb browser downloads\n## 13%\n\nOther\n\n\n#### Stay current\n\nThe HP Wolf Security Threat Insights Report is made\npossible by most of our customers who opt to share\nthreat telemetry with HP.
