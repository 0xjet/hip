With its targeted nature and history for choosing high-profile victims, we shine our\nspotlight on RansomEXX to reveal its tactics, techniques, and procedures.\n\nView infographic of \"Ransomware Spotlight: RansomEXX\"\n\nRansomExx is a [ransomware variant that debuted as Defray777 in 2018. It made a name for itself in 2020,](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/ransomware)\n[after it was used in widely reported attacks on government agencies, manufacturers, and other such high-](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/the-state-of-ransomware-2020-s-catch-22)\nprofile only months apart. By then, it was dubbed RansomEXX after the string “ransom.exx” was found in\nits binary. In 2020, the group also started a leak site for publishing stolen data.\n\n[Today, RansomEXX remains an active name among other ransomware variants like LockBit and Conti.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-lockbit)\nLike other groups, the one running RansomEXX appears to have no qualms about publishing data stolen\nfrom its targets. It has also published information stolen from government agencies — a recent case was an\n[attack on a Scottish mental health charity in March 2022, where they published 12GB worth of data that](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/hotforsecurity/scottish-mental-health-charity-devastated-by-heartless-ransomexx-ransomware-attack/)\nincluded the personal information and even credit card details of the charity’s volunteers.\n\nThis paints a picture of how RansomEXX operates and why it should be thwarted. To help in this regard,\nthis report looks into its specific tactics, tools, and methods, so that organizations can be better prepared to\ndefend against it.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## What do organizations need to know about RansomEXX\n\n[RansomEXX is another ransomware variant that runs on a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and has](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tr/security/definition/ransomware-as-a-service-raas)\nbeen consistently active since its discovery. Up to the present, RansomEXX has been responsible for\nattacks and publishing stolen data on its leak site. Here is an overview of what RansomEXX is known for:\n\n**It has both a Windows and Linux variant. RansomEXX’s Linux version, discovered in late**\n[2020, marked the first known time a major Windows ransomware variant expanded to Linux. This](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-version-of-ransomexx-ransomware-discovered/)\nmove allows modern ransomware variants to target core infrastructure that are often running on\nLinux.\n**Linked to the threat group** **[Gold Dupont. The threat group has been active since 2018. They are](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-dupont)**\na financially motivated cybercriminal group with a main arsenal that includes RansomEXX or\nDefray777, Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, and Vatet Loader.\n**Uses trojanized legitimate tools. RansomEXX campaigns, as typical of Gold Dupont attacks,**\ninvolve malware like Vatet Loader, PyXie RAT, TrickBot, and post-intrusion tools like Cobalt Strike\n[as part of their arsenal. The use of trojanized legitimate tools is common among modern ransomware](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/locked-loaded-and-in-the-wrong-hands-legitimate-tools-weaponized-for-ransomware-in-2021)\nvariants, allowing them to deploy payloads faster while avoiding detection.\n**Hardcoded name of the target in its binary. One of the key indicators of RansomEXX’s**\ntargeted nature is how it has its target’s name hardcoded in its binary. It demonstrates how\nRansomEXX attacks involve a certain amount of preparation and are tailored to their chosen victim’s\nprofile.\n\nAside from these known characteristics of RansomEXX, an interesting development in its more recent\nhistory is its attack on a mental health charity. Prior to this particular attack, RansomEXX targeted larger\norganizations like a government agency, a major clothing store in Brazil, and many others. Ransomware\ngroups are known to choose targets based on their ability to pay hefty ransoms, making the attack on the\ncharity organization a particular departure.\n\nOperating as an RaaS, the actors behind RansomEXX conduct reconnaissance before each campaign to\nhelp them choose the right tools from their arsenal to build an efficient attack. For example, RansomEXX\nhas [employed IcedID and Vatet loader, among others, for an attack in which deploying the ransomware](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/a/expanding-range-and-improving-speed-a-ransomexx-approach.html)\nonly took five hours after initial access. The next sections look at the regions and industries the group has\ntargeted most often, based on our detections.\n\n-->\n\n## Top affected industries and countries\n\n\n-----\n\nOur telemetry shows data on RansomEXX activity or attack attempts from March 31, 2021 to March 31,\n2022. We observed RansomEXX activity from all over the globe, but the heaviest concentration was in USA\nin France followed by Brazil. The reason behind this observation is the 2021 RansomEXX attack on a major\nhardware manufacturer in Taiwan.\n\nFigure 1. Countries with the highest number of attack attempts for the RansomEXX ransomware (March\n31, 2021 to March 31, 2022) Source: Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ ™\n\nBased on our detections, RansomEXX was most active in the manufacturing sector, followed by the\neducation and banking sectors. Overall, the differences are relatively slim given the small sample size.\n\nFigure 2. Industries with the highest number of attack attempts for AvosLocker ransomware (March 31,\n2021 to March 31, 2022)Source: Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™\n\n## Infection chain and techniques\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven that RansomEXX operates on the RaaS model, its infection chain can vary depending on the target\nand the affiliate carrying out the various stages of the attack.\n\nFigure 3. RansomEXX infection chain\n\n**Initial Access**\n\nRansomEXX has been known to use Malspam to infiltrate machines and deliver multiple tools and\nrelated malware before finally deploying the actual ransomware payload.\n\n**Execution and Exfiltration**\n\nThe threat actors make use of different pieces of malware for execution. From our telemetry, we saw\nIcedID, TrickBot, Cobalt Strike beacons, and PyXie RAT. These are known to be used in other\ncampaigns as well. PyXie RAT also has the capability to exfiltrate data and obtain information from\nthe target machine.\n\n**Lateral Movement**\n\nFor lateral movement, multiple server message block (SMB) hits were seen on our telemetry. This has\nbeen used to deliver VATET loader.\n\n**Discovery**\n\nSimilar to other campaigns, RansomEXX also makes use of Mimikatz and LaZagne to extract\ncredentials from the target machine.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe deployment of the final ransomware payload ensures that files are encrypted in the machine.\nRansomEXX encrypts files using advanced encryption standard (AES), while the AES key is\nencrypted using RSA encryption.\n\nFigure 4. Sample ransom note\n\n**Other technical details**\n\nIt avoids encrypting the following strings in their file

IcedID Mimikatz SMB RansomEXX\n\nTrickBot LaZagne\n\nPyXie RAT\n\nCobalt Strike beacon\n\nVatet Loader\n\n## Recommendations\n\nRansomEXX is not as active as it had been in 2020, when its consecutive attacks made it one of the newer\nransomware families to watch out for. However, being a highly targeted and human-operated ransomware,\nits attacks affect its victims and their reputation significantly. The combination of memory-based\ntechniques, legitimate Windows tools, and post-intrusion contribute a lot to RansomEXX’s successes.\n\nPreventing the attacks from the outset is key to avoiding the worst of ransomware campaigns.\nOrganizations should learn from past RansomEXX campaigns and be vigilant against initial access tactics.\nUsers should be wary of enabling macros, and of documents that prompt them to do so.\n\nTo help defend systems against similar threats, organizations can establish security frameworks that can\nallocate resources systematically for establishing solid defenses against ransomware.\n\nHere are some best practices that can be included in these frameworks:\n\n**Audit and inventory**\n\n\n-----\n\nTake an inventory of assets and data.\nIdentify authorized and unauthorized devices and software.\nMake an audit of event and incident logs.\n\n**Configure and monitor**\n\nManage hardware and software configurations.\nGrant admin privileges and access only when necessary to an employee’s role.\nMonitor network ports, protocols, and services.\nActivate security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls and routers.\nEstablish a software allowlist that only executes legitimate applications.\n\n**Patch and update**\n\nConduct regular vulnerability assessments.\nPerform patching or virtual patching for operating systems and applications.\nUpdate software and applications to their latest versions.\n\n**Protect and recover**\n\nImplement data protection, back up, and recovery measures.\nEnable multifactor authentication (MFA).\n\n**Secure and defend**\n\nEmploy sandbox analysis to block malicious emails.\nDeploy the latest versions of security solutions to all layers of the system, including email, endpoint,\nweb, and network.\nDetect early signs of an attack such as the presence of suspicious tools in the system.\nUse advanced detection technologies such as those powered by AI and machine learning.\n\n**Train and test**\n\nRegularly train and assess employees on security skills.\nConduct red-team exercises and penetration tests.\n\nA multilayered approach can help organizations guard possible entry points into the system (endpoint,\nemail, web, and network). Security solutions that can detect malicious components and suspicious\nbehavior can also help protect enterprises.\n\n[Trend Micro Vision One™ provides multilayered protection and behavior detection, which helps](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response.html)\nblock questionable behavior and tools early on before the ransomware can do irreversible damage to\nthe system.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Trend Micro Cloud One](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/hybrid-cloud/cloud-one-workload-security.html) Workload Security protects systems against both known and unknown\nthreats that exploit vulnerabilities. This protection is made possible through techniques such as\nvirtual patching and machine learning.\n[Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Email Inspector employs custom sandboxing and advanced analysis](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps/email-and-collaboration/email-inspector.html)\ntechniques to effectively block malicious emails, including phishing emails that can serve as entry\npoints for ransomware.\n[Trend Micro Apex One™ offers next-level automated threat detection and response against advanced](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps/endpoint.html)\nconcerns such as fileless threats and ransomware, ensuring the protection of endpoints.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n[The IOCs for this article can be found here.
