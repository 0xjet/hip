This malicious activity, which we attributed to the\nthreat actor Scarlet Mimic, was first [brought to light back in 2016.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/scarlet-mimic-years-long-espionage-targets-minority-activists/)\n\nSince then, CPR has observed the group using more than 20 different variations of their\nAndroid malware, disguised in multiple Uyghur-related baits such as books, pictures, and\neven an audio version of the Quran, the holy text of the Islamic faith. The malware is\nrelatively unsophisticated from a technical standpoint. However, its capabilities allow the\nattackers to easily steal sensitive data from the infected device, as well as perform calls or\nsend an SMS on the victim’s behalf and track their location in real-time. Also, it allows audio\nrecording of incoming and outgoing calls, as well as surround recording. All this makes it a\npowerful and dangerous surveillance tool.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this report, we present a technical analysis and describe the evolution of the campaign in\nthe last seven years. Although a small part of this campaign was briefly discussed in Cyble’s\n[publication as an isolated and unattributed incident, in this article we put the whole campaign](https://blog.cyble.com/2022/09/05/spyware-campaign-targeting-the-uyghur-community/)\nin perspective and outline almost a decade’s worth of persistent efforts in phone surveillance\nof the Uyghur community.\n\n## Overview of the campaign\n\nSince 2015, CPR has identified more than 20 samples of Android spyware called\n**MobileOrder, with the latest variant dated mid-August 2022. As there are no indications that**\nany of them were distributed from the Google Store, we can assume the malware is\ndistributed by other means, most likely by social engineering campaigns. In most cases, the\nmalicious applications masquerade as PDF documents, photos, or audio. When the victim\nopens the decoy content, the malware begins to perform extensive surveillance actions in\nthe background. These include stealing sensitive data such as the device info, SMS and\ncalls, the device location, and files stored on the device. The malware is also capable of\nactively executing commands to run a remote shell, take photos, perform calls, manipulate\nthe SMS, call logs and local files, and record the surround sound.\n\n_Figure 1 – MobileOrder malware samples observed in the wild._\n\n\n-----\n\nAll the samples are based on the code of the MobileOrder malware from 2015, although\nduring the ensuing years some changes were introduced by the developers. A few of these\nchanges were clearly developed to reduce the chances of the malware being detected by\nsecurity solutions: the malware authors experimented with ways to hide the malicious strings\n(which indicate the malware’s intentions), first by moving them to the resources section, and\nlater encoding them in base64.\n\nThe actors also added a few adjustments and features to gather more information from their\nvictims’ devices. One new aspect is to move from using AMAP SDK, an Android SDK used\nto identify geolocation, to using the standard Android LocationListener implementation. This\nallows the attackers to track their target’s location in real-time instead of an on-demand\nbasis.\n\n_Figure 2 – Evolution of the Android malware._\n\nThe MobileOrder malware, despite being actively used and updated, still does not support\nmodern Android OS features, such as runtime permissions or new intent for APK installation,\nand does not use techniques common to most modern malware such as accessibility usage,\navoiding battery optimization, etc.\n\nWe are not able to identify which attacks have been successful, however, the fact that the\nthreat actors continue to develop and deploy the malware for so many years suggests that\nthey have been successful in at least some of their operations.\n\n## Technical analysis\n\nWhen the victim opens the lure, whether it is a document, picture, or audio file, it actually\nlaunches the malicious application, which in turn opens a decoy document to distract the\nvictim from background malicious actions. Some of the versions also ask for Device Admin\n\n\n-----\n\nand root access, which not only gives the malware full access to the device, but also\nprevents the victim from easily uninstalling the application:\n\n_Figure 3 – Device admin activation and superuser request._\n\nThe malware then hides its icon and launches two services: core and open. The open\nservice is responsible for showing the victim the decoy content (a PDF file or an image or an\naudio record) which is stored in res/raw/, res/drawable/ or assets:\n\n_Figure 4 – Malware code that displays a decoy picture from February 2022 version._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe core service launches the Communication thread, which connects to the C&C\n(command & control) server and processes the commands received, and the KeepAlive\n_thread, which periodically triggers a connection to the server and relaunches the parent_\nservice.\n\n_Figure 5 – The service that starts the Communication and KeepAlive threads._\n\nHowever, the KeepAlive _thread is not the only one responsible for keeping the malware_\nactive. The malware developer also created BroadcastReceiver that starts the core Service.\nThe triggers for this receiver are numerous actions registered in the AndroidManifest, making\nsure the malware stays active all the time.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 – AndroidManifest.xml specifying triggers for the BroadcastReceiver which is_\n_responsible for keeping the malware alive._\n\n### C&C Communication\n\nDepending on the sample, the malware can use a hardcoded list of C&C servers, dead drop\nresolvers, or both.\n\nFirst, the malware starts the process of resolving the C&C server, which includes decoding\nthe built-in C&C addresses and, where it is defined, extracting the C&C server from dead\ndrop resolvers which point to additional C&C infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 – The malware decodes the hardcoded C&C domains and the C&C server from the_\n_dead drop resolver._\n\nThe use of dead drop resolvers helps prevent the infrastructure from being easily discovered\nthrough static analysis, but also enables operational resiliency as this infrastructure may be\ndynamically changed. All the versions of the malware that make use of dead drop resolvers\nquery different posts on the Chinese Sina blog platform.\n\n**Dead drop resolvers**\n\nFirst, the malware requests a specific blog page:\n\n_Figure 8 – Dead drop resolver on a Sina blog post._\n\nThen it searches the received HTML for a specific base64-encoded regex pattern and\ndecodes it to get the real C&C IP address and port.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 – The code responsible for regex pattern matching of the dead drop resolvers._\n\nIn this specific example, the string `MjA5Ljk3LjE3My4xMjQ6MjY3NQ== is decoded to`\n```\n209.97.173.124:2675 . The malware then creates a socket connection to the specified IP\n\n```\nand port.\n\n**Encryption**\n\nTo secure communication with the C&C server, the malware encrypts the data with AES. The\nkey is generated in runtime from an encrypted passphrase inside dex by calculating the MD5\ndigest:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10- AES key generation._\n\n### Command execution\n\nAfter successfully connecting to the C&C, the malware processes commands from the\nremote server. It first reads a command, then an argument size, and finally the actual\nencrypted arguments.\n\nThis is the full list of commands:\n\n\n**Command**\n**ID**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n64 Send a list of files from the specific path.\n\n65 Send a list of processes running on the device.\n\n67 Send device and connectivity information (IMEI, Phone Number, Network\ntype, Accounts, Installed applications, Browser history and others).\n\n68 Delete specific files on the device.\n\n69 Upload files from a specified path on the device to the C&C server.\n\n70 Download files from the C&C server (any file type).\n\n71 Upload all SMS messages.\n\n72 Upload all Contacts.\n\n73 Upload all Call Logs.\n\n74 Take a photo from the camera.\n\n77 Start Audio Recording task (immediately or at a specified time).\n\n78 Start “Network” location updates and send cell location info immediately.\n\n79 Start “GPS” location updates.\n\n82 Install APK (silently or via UI).\n\n83 Uninstall the application (silently or via UI).\n\n84 Execute “ chmod -R 777 ” to a specific path via `su .`\n\n85 Launch a specific application on the device.\n\n86 Send Broadcast with a specific action to trigger other applications.\n\n87 Run shell command.\n\n\n-----\n\n88 Change the minimal time interval between a location updates.\n\n89 Disable location tracking.\n\n91 Check if a screen is on.\n\n92 Send SMS to a specific number.\n\n93 Delete specific SMS.\n\n94 Perform call to a specific number.\n\n96 Delete a specific call log.\n\n97 Update the C&C list.\n\n98 Take a screenshot.\n\nAs we can see from this list, the malware contains stealer functionality to upload all kinds of\nsensitive data from the device (device info, SMS, calls, location, etc.), but also provides RAT\nfunctionality by executing active commands on the device such as remote shell, file\ndownloading, taking photos, performing calls, manipulating the SMS and call logs, etc. In the\nnext sections, we analyze the most important functions.\n\n### SMS and Call Logs manipulation\n\nThe malware has commands to upload all the SMS and call logs to the attackers’ server. In\naddition, it provides the functionality to send text messages or perform a call to a specific\nnumber. This allows the actors to conduct further malicious activity against additional targets\nby impersonating the current victim, using his name, phone number and credibility. This\ndrastically increases the chances of success.\n\nTo hide these actions from the victim, the attackers may use commands to remove the last\nmessages or call logs so that no traces of their interactions with third parties are left on the\ndevice.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11- Malware code responsible for running calls / sending SMS from a victim’s device_\n_and functions to cover the evidence of these actions._\n\n### Location tracking\n\nThe malware can collect the victim’s device location and track its changes over time. When it\nis launched, the malware registers a location listener, which means Android will trigger this\nlistener every time the location is changed.\n\nThe malware collects latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, bearing, accuracy, and the provider\n(GPS or network) that supplied these results. It also tries to convert the current location from\nlatitude and longitude coordinates to a physical address using the Geocoder class. The\nnumber of details and the precision of this reverse geocoding process may vary. For\nexample, one set of coordinates can be translated to the full street address of the closest\nbuilding, while another might contain only a city name and a postal code.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe geolocation data is immediately sent by the spyware to the remote server. Additionally,\nthe malicious application also writes this data with a timestamp to the file called map.dat,\nthereby continuously collecting and saving the victim’s geolocation. Even if the internet\nconnection on a victim’s devices or to the C&C server is unavailable, the file with all the\ngeolocation information is continuously updated and is uploaded to the attacker-controlled\nserver when the connection is restored.\n\n_Figure 12 – Location updates processing and reverse geocoding._\n\nThe attackers can also configure the Location listener parameters remotely:\n\nChange the minimal interval between the location updates – This allows the actors to\ndecrease the number of updates but can still track the victim.\nChange the provider for location tracking between GPS (based on satellite usage) or\nnetwork (based on the availability of cell towers and WiFi access points).\n\nBefore the malware developers started to utilize the standard Android LocationListener, the\nmalware used a third-party SDK called AMAP to track the victim’s location. The overall idea\nis similar: when the malicious app receives a command from the attackers’ server to start\ntracking the device’s location, it subscribes to location updates from the AMAP SDK. This\nway, at every location change, the malware writes the current location with a timestamp to\nthe map.dat file and stores it as a variable.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13 – Device location tracking in the versions that use the AMAP SDK_\n\nAs a result, the attackers can send commands from the remote server to read the current\nlocation or to request a full tracking file.\n\nTo summarize, in the most recent versions, the malware developers added the ability to track\ntheir target’s location in real-time. The malware sends location updates on its own, compared\nto previous versions where the server needed to send additional commands to get the\nlocation information.\n\n### Call recording and file upload\n\nTo record both incoming and outgoing calls from the infected device’s microphone, the\nmalware uses a BroadcastReceiver called CallRecorder. It monitors the phone state and\nsaves the call records locally to the db file, so that it can be uploaded later to the attackercontrolled remote server by issuing the “upload file” command.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14 – The malware code responsible for recording the incoming and outgoing calls._\n\n### Surround recording\n\nBesides recording incoming and outgoing calls, the attackers can start surround recording\nremotely by issuing a relevant command from the C&C server.\n\nWhen the command is received, the malware gets as an argument the desired duration and\nthe specified delay before the recording starts. If there is no delay specified, it launches a\nthread that immediately starts to record. Otherwise, it creates a PendingIntent for the\n_BroadcastReceiver that is registered in AlarmManager – and as a result, triggers a recording_\nin the specified time.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15 – Starting audio recordings._\n\nAfter the AudioRecording thread performs the recording with the specified duration, it saves\nit to the db file with the timestamp:\n\n_Figure 16 – Surround recording implementation._\n\nAs the recorded files may be quite large, we would expect to see some restrictions in the\ncode on how the resulting files are exfiltrated (for example, upload the files only via Wi-Fi\nnetworks), but there are no such limitations in the code. However, there is no automatic\n\n\n-----\n\nupload for the recorded calls. The attackers decide when to exfiltrate the files, so they could\nsend a command to get device information (which contains the current network connection\ntype) and then exfiltrate the files from the device when convenient.\n\nBecause the attackers have updated information about the victim’s location, they can choose\nthe opportune moment to record offline private conversations, which affects not only the\nvictim’s privacy but also that of unsuspecting third parties.\n\n### Remote shell\n\nThe malware can receive commands to execute a remote shell, which is done by starting a\nthread that, in turn, starts a shell process and establishes a socket connection to the same\nC&C server, but over a different port. The shell’s output is redirected to the socket output\nstream from which the malware reads the commands, then decrypts and executes them:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17 – Remote shell execution._\n\n### Drop additional APK\n\nWhen it receives a command to install an APK, the malware starts a thread that checks if it\nhas enough privileges to install the application silently. If the check fails, the malware\nlaunches a regular UI installation via intent:\n\n_Figure 18 – Silent apk installation via PackageManager._\n\nUninstalling an application performs exactly the same logic.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThe first report that summarized the activity of Scarlet Mimic and various elements of this\nthreat was [published in 2016. It reviewed a series of persistent attacks that targeted Uyghur](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/scarlet-mimic-years-long-espionage-targets-minority-activists/)\nand Tibetan minority rights activists as well as those who support their cause.\n\nThe group’s arsenal at that point included multiple Trojans and tools for Windows and\nmacOS. In 2015, the actors started to expand their espionage efforts from PCs to mobile\ndevices using the spyware called MobileOrder, which focused on compromising Android\ndevices Based on the code similarity shared infrastructure and victimology we conclude\n\n\n-----\n\nthat the new wave of attacks belongs to the same threat actor and that the group continues\nto deploy and develop MobileOrder malware until this day. In addition to clear code overlaps,\nwe observed multiple overlaps in the infrastructure between the new samples and the old\nMobileOrder malware variant, as well as multiple variants of Windows Psylo Trojan\npreviously attributed to Scarlet Mimic, that interact with the same malicious domains as the\nmobile malware.\n\n[In late 2017, Lookout research published their report on another cluster of malicious activity,](https://www.lookout.com/blog/mobile-threat-jaderat)\nwhich relied on JadeRAT Android malware to target the Uyghur community. This campaign\n[“had some overlap [with ScarletMimic] around the apps they trojanized, the likely groups they](https://www.cyberscoop.com/lookout-china-scarlet-mimic-jaderat/)\ntargeted, their capabilities, and to some extent their implementation.”\n\nTogether with the evidence of the ongoing campaign using Android spyware provided in this\nreport, this emphasizes the heavy shift of activity targeting these minority groups towards\nmobile surveillance in the last few years.\n\n### Code overlaps\n\nThe MobileOrder from the 2015 report also started by registering itself as a device admin\nwith admin privileges to secure its persistence and to lay a proper foundation for the rest of\nthe malware’s functionalities:\n\n_Figure 19 – MobileOrder sample from 2015 (md5: a886cbf8f8840b21eb2f662b64deb730)_\n_requesting device admin privileges vs the sample from April 2020 performing the same_\n_request (right)_\n\nThe 2015 version of MobileOrder masqueraded as a PDF document, with an embedded PDF\ncalled `rd.pdf in the application’s resources. This is similar to all the new samples in the`\nongoing campaign where the decoy content is PDF files. The bait PDF extracted from the\nmalware resources is written to the device’s SD card and displayed to the victim while\nexecuting the malicious actions in the background:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 20 – APK structure and the decoy PDF file location in 2015 sample of MobileOrder_\n_and August 2022 sample (right)._\n\nThe main communication thread, which is responsible for communicating with a C&C server\nvia socket and processing received commands, also did not change much over time,\nalthough many of the commands themselves changed the command id, and a few more\nfunctionalities were added.\n\n_Figure 21 – Command processing in MobileOrder from 2015 vs commands processing in_\n_newer samples (deobfuscated code)._\n\n## Victimology and lures\n\n\n-----\n\nMost of the malicious applications we observed have names in the Uyghur language, in its\nArabic or Latin scripts. They contain different decoys (documents, pictures, or audio\nsamples) with content related to the ethnic geopolitical conflict centered on Uyghurs\nin China’s far-northwest region of Xinjiang, or with the religious content referencing the\nUyghurs’ Muslim identification. We can therefore conclude that this campaign is likely\nintended to target the Uyghur minority or organizations and individuals supporting them,\nwhich is consistent with the Scarlet Mimic group’s previously reported activity.\n\nA few interesting examples of decoys used by the actor over the years include:\n\nThe sample with the original name “photo” (md5:a4f09ccb185d73df1dec4a0b16bf6e2c)\ncontains the picture of Elqut Alim, the “New Chief Media Officer” of the Norwegian\nYouth Union who call themselves “a group of Uyghur youth who live in Norway with a\ncommon understanding and a common goal, which is to stand up against China’s\ninvasion of East Turkestan.” The malware was uploaded to VT with the name in Uyghur\nLatin and a fake “.jpg” extension.\n\n_Figure 22 – Decoy image from the sample a4f09ccb185d73df1dec4a0b16bf6e2c._\n\nThe application named پارتىزانلىق ئشى” which translates from Uyghur to “Guerrillaۇرۇ\nWarfare” (md5: b5fb0fb9488e1b8aa032d7788282005f) contains the PDF version of the\nshort version of the military course by Yusuf al-Ayeri, the now deceased first leader\nof Al-Qaeda in Saudi Arabia, which outlines the tactical methods of guerrilla warfare.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 23 – The lure PDF containing the materials by the military wing of Al-Qaeda._\n\nAnother sample called “rasimim” (“pictures” in Uyghur, sample\nmd5:06c8c089157ff059e78bca5aeb430810) contains multiple pictures referring to the\nescalated tensions in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in May 2014, including the\ndeployment of special police forces next to the Urumqi Railway Station and the medical\nevacuation after a terrorist attack in a street market.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 24 – The lure pictures of escalations in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang._\n\nThe [sample called “The China Freedom Trap” (md5:](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1562741109171752960)\na38e8d70855412b7ece6de603b35ad63) masquerades as a partial PDF of the book\nwith the same name written by Dolkun Isa, politician and activist from the region of\nXinjiang and the current president of the World Uyghur Congress:\n\n_Figure 25 – The cover of the lure PDF._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sample called quran kerim which translates as Noble Quran (md5:\nf10c5efe7eea3c5b7ebb7f3bf7624073) uses as a decoy an mp3 file of a recorded\nspeech in what seems to be a Turkic language.\n\nSome of the other lures include the pictures of unidentified individuals, and as reverse\nsearch engines fail to trace their origin, we can assume that these pictures are borrowed\nfrom the private profiles of these individuals in some social networks or were stolen from\ntheir mobile devices as a result of the spyware deployment.\n\nIt’s interesting that one of the samples, called “القائمة” (“The list” in Arabic) with the package\nname `com.sy.go.immx (md5:7bf2ca0e7242cabcee8d3bb37ac52fc7) doesn’t follow the`\npattern of referencing Uyghurs. The name and the lure of this application is in Arabic, and\n[the lure document contains a picture of a list of persons wanted by Shabwah Governorate in](https://www.alameenpress.info/news/21776)\nYemen for threatening the security and stability of the province. This may indicate the\nadditional targeting of individuals or organizations located in a different geographical zone\nand involved in another conflict.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOver the years, Scarlet Mimic strongly continues its espionage operations against the\nUyghur community using Android malware. The persistence of the campaign, the evolution\nof the malware and the persistent focus on targeting specific populations indicate that the\ngroup’s operations over the years are successful to some extent. This threat group’s shift in\ntheir attack vector into the mobile sector provides another evidence of a growing tendency of\nextensive surveillance operations executed on mobile devices as the most sensitive and\nprivate assets.\n\n**Check Point’s** **[Harmony Mobile helps securing mobile devices across all attack](https://www.checkpoint.com/harmony/mobile-security/mobile/)**\n**vectors: apps, network and OS and protects against Android malware such as the one**\n**used on this campaign.**\n\n**Harmony Mobile leverages Check Point’s ThreatCloud and award-winning file**\n**protection capabilities to block the download of malicious files to mobile devices and**\n**prevent file-based cyber-attacks, such as the one’s described on this blog.**\n\n## IOCs\n\n**SHA256** **Package Name**\n\n```\nfd99acc504649e8e42687481abbceb71c730f0ab032357d4dc1e95a6ef8\nbb7ca\n\n```\n```\ncom.emc.pdf\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n**SHA256** **Package Name**\n\n```\n89f350332be1172fc2d64ac8ecd7fd15a09a2bd6e0ab6a7898a48fb3e5c\n9eac3\n84ce04fd8d1c15046e7d50cd429876f0f5fbca526d7a0a081b6b9a49fe6\n6131f\nf876b2a60d4cf7f88925f435f29f89c0393f57a59ec46d490c7e87821f2\n9fc0f\nc2cd40f1c21719d4611ff645c7f960d0070c19e8ad12cc55aded7b5a341\nc89a3\n2e94183fcbc3381071d023a030640aaef64739006b6c22603b94b970ceb\neeec2\n73729646a7768a5bd4c301842c19b3b16bb190e435af466a731ad365449\n82098\n13e457ce16c0fe24ad0f4fe41a6ad251ebffb2fdaaebe7df094d7852ba0\ncfdc6\n155d0707858cbb18ed5ecb4d98009288e4c5a1e68275d9db5b2390f2046\n36431\n0703185a3e206b8da96a86f4bbcb750b48bbec8b2fc2598eed8603e4027\ncf4ae\nbe0ae4394b8592cd1325b86669fa78f9ccd320d23f839e81001138be914\na760f\n990e50ce20706be80b4d62367ff6ed615d6dd04551b42cfd80b1a895006\n5b646\n\n```\n```\npw.nrt.photo.g\noogle\ncom.sy.go.immx\ncom.pdf.google\n.vv\ncom.pdf.google\n.vm\ncom.pdf.google\n.vm\ncom.pdf.google\n.vm\ncom.photo.andr\noid.p\ncom.update.goo\ngle\ncom.photo.andr\noid.p\ncom.photo.andr\noid.p\ncom.photo.andr\noid.p\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n**SHA256** **Package Name**\n\n```\n633739c3b51715516fb226b3b9c693530d8ef715ac19093cdf6aaf10814\n9b91f\ne959dc221a8667cde8b9ff080d078e60ed1e8bf5a3c6f1f352919c9b8f6\n96830\ne3ee0ccfb01e2effd49feddb252781baa2a05f8360d5cf949d09e3add1e\n73e4d\n126e41c231c1b5a25584e27d47132d0d243da155e6a70517d08dbf61120\n1fdca\ned3aa8e58d65c81df2f18e970456225b7c2b78e4add4dea556298a915b8\nfef1a\n35adf82e2ace8fe0ddfd50b21dad274df40696f5dfcdf7372fe63eed8bb\ned869\n03004ccc23033a09532bea7dfa08c8dfa85814a15f5e3aedb924a028bcd\n6f908\nafcbf339d1c0a6174f93425cd1b8ba50979132856f0c333865a62d7c6e8\na3084\n91c34071622b678b2f64a8b896c7898cceff658764eb0ae5e100b3d4d86\n8a664\n549ea085fbb23729ee000721938d95ea38ff2e70a63af1d4aa8db6b7b34\n58f6f\nba08ee68d9218e0aaa3384bcb2ab281fd8273fe40aee65c300adbf85120\ncbc7b\n\n```\n```\ncom.view.openp\ndf\ncom.view.openp\ndf\ncom.photo.andr\noid.p\ncom.photo.andr\noid\ncom.photo.andr\noid\ncom.photo.andr\noid\ncom.view.openp\ndf\ncom.photo.andr\noid\ncom.photo.andr\noid\ncom.photo.andr\noid\ncom.lppads.and\nroid\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n**Indicator** **Type**\n```\nadfgasfasfasf123[.]com C&C\nblackbeekey[.com C&C\nfly100.dellgod[.]net C&C\nislam.ansardawlatalislam[.]com C&C\nk7k7[.]co C&C\nmobile.muslimbro[.]org C&C\nziba.lenovositegroup[.]com C&C\n209.97.173[.]124 C&C\n45.32.112[.]182 C&C\n\n```\n```\nhttps://blog.sina.com[.]cn/u/52411\n06671\nhttps://blog.sina.com[.]cn/u/59557\n75229\nhttps://blog.sina[.]cn/dpool/blog/\ns78u\nhttps://blog.sina.com[.]cn/u/59269\n10809\n\n```\n```\nDead drop\nresolver\nDead drop\nresolver\nDead drop\nresolver\nDead drop\nresolver\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n-----",
