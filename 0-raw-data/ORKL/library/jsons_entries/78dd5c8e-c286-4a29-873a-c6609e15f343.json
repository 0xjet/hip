The Android RAT was mostly spotted in China and Japan. What makes it a\n“targeted threat” is that it seems to have been developed by Italian speakers targeting specific Android devices, selecting their\n**victims based on their devices” IMEI codes. The analyzed samples date from December 2015 to June 2016.**\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\nChecks if it”s installed on specific devices, based on IMEI numbers;\nContains code strings in Italian;\nConnects to Italian C&C servers;\nTargets rooted devices;\nMostly spotted in China;\n\n**Context: The analyzed Android RAT requires a rooted device to exfiltrate data. Considering that 80 percent of China”s mobile users use**\nrooted smartphones, this further supports that it might have been intended for spying on specific devices â€“ possibly on the Chinese\nmarket – using IMEI filtering capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n[However, even if the targeted device is not rooted, previous Bitdefender research has revealed that some malicious Android applications](https://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/android-malware-promises-porn-but-roots-device-and-installs-other-malware-13900.html)\ncome fully loaded with exploit packs aimed at rooting Android devices, regardless of the operating system they”re running. Consequently,\nit”s not difficult to envision a scenario in which a device can be stealthily rooted and then remotely controlled with a RAT like the one\nanalyzed here.\n\nWhile during our previous research we found that a malicious app could pack four different exploit packs, other security researchers have\n[also revealed that some malware can even pack up to 18 different Android rooting modules to gain full control over the device. Of course,](http://www.cmcm.com/blog/en/security/2016-06-29/995.html)\nin that particular instance the Trojan was only used to generate revenue by downloading and installing apps on victim”s devices, not to\ninstall surveillance tools.\n\n**Analyzing Samples**\n\nBitdefender researchers found a series of samples containing this highly targeted Android RAT, dating from December 2015 to June 2016.\nWhile it”s been distributed under two package names – “it.cyprus.client” and “it.assistenzaumts.update” â€“ the basic functionality of\nthe RAT is the same. Neither of the two packages has any interface once it lands on the device.\n\nAlthough the samples were not found in Google Play, one ound in early February 2016 (md5: 667452e44935325c2b20a3d7204efe3b,\npackage: “it.assistenzaumts.update”) stirred curiosity as it only connected to specific Command and Control servers only if it validated a\nseries of IMEI codes.\n\nSince the IMEI number usually can identify the exact model of an Android device, the devices the RAT specifically searched for were a\n**Samsung N9005 Galaxy Note 3 LTE, a Samsung SM-G355HN Galaxy 2 Core, a LG D820 Nexus 5 and a G355H Galaxy Core II** **(SM-**\n**G355HN). (Fig. 1)**\n\nIf the IMEI scan resulted in a match, the RAT would connect to a specific IP address â€“ belonging to the attacker-controlled command and\ncontrol center â€“ and start pulling various instructions.\n\n\nPossibly Italy-Born Android RAT Reported in China, Find Bitdefender Researchers\n\n\nFig. 1 â€“Code from January sample that checks for specific IMEI codes.\n\nOther RAT functionalities found in the sample point to traditional behavior, such as taking screenshots at various time intervals, copying the\ndevice”s phone settings and sending them to the command and control server, and moving screenshots to the device”s SD card and the\nuploading them to the attackers” server. (Fig. 2)\n\n\n-----\n\nPossibly Italy Born Android RAT Reported in China, Find Bitdefender Researchers\n\n\nFig. 2 – Code from January sample that copies screenshots onto SD card\n\nIn late June and early July, Bitdefender researchers found two more versions of the same RAT, but this time mostdevices that reported the\nsamples seemed to originate in China. The original sample for February seems to indicate that the device the RAT was tested on was only\nused for testing, probably for ironing out bugs or checking the malware”s functionality.\n\nHowever, these new reports seem to indicate that the it.assistenzaumts.update package was reported by 7 Android devices in China\n**and one in Netherlands, according to Bitdefender telemetry. (Fig. 3)**\n\n\n-----\n\nPossibly Italy Born Android RAT Reported in China, Find Bitdefender Researchers\n\n\nFig. 3 â€“ Telemetry on “it.assistenzaumts.update” reports, between January â€“ July 2016\n\nAnother interesting aspect of the newly found “it.assistenzaumts.update” RAT samples (MD5: 83c90e931a1a9b249b2f9ce8bf5ecd0b\nand MD5: 88e8e4ff540fb881d1300f9759026904), seem to indicate that the newer versions don”t have the C&C server IP addresses\nhardcoded to the IMEI. (Fig. 4) In fact, they just send the victim”s IMEI code to a specific IP and port address. Naturally, the new C&C IP\nstill originates in Italy.\n\n\nPossibly Italy-Born Android RAT Reported in\nChina, Find Bitdefender Researchers\n\n\nFig. 4 â€“ New version of “it.assistenzaumts.update” that doesn”t have C&C IP”s hardcoded based on IMEI codes\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly enough, the **it.cyprus.client package was not only reported in China, but also in Japan. (Fig. 5) The package seems to**\nhave the same abilities as the one analyzed above, except that it”s delivered under a different name.\n\n\nPossibly Italy-Born Android RAT Reported in China, Find Bitdefender Researchers\n\n\nFig. 5 Telemetry on “it.cyprus.client” reports, December 2015 â€“ July 2016\n\n**Takeaway**\n\nIt”s worth mentioning that the RAT”s full spying capabilities only work on rooted devices. While some of it”s basic capabilities, such as\ndevice identification, work on non-rooted devices, the malware appears to designed specifically for rooted Android smartphones.\n\nChina is well known for having its own surprisingly large Android marketplaces. Coupling this with the fact that the RAT specifically seeks\nout particular IMEI codes (devices), one can speculate that its developers are highly keen on infecting specific individuals there.\n\nSince only advanced persistent threats (APT) normally exhibit this type of selectivity when infecting victims, this Android RAT could be part\nof a wider attack that we”ve yet to uncover.\n\n[As usual, make sure that you always use a mobile security solution on your devices, as to prevent malicious applications from installing,](http://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/mobile-security-android.html)\nand make sure that you only download apps from official marketplaces.\n\n**Samples:**\n\nMD5 Package Name Detection\n\n3170ea805a0f216c21c554bb576e75fb it.cyprus.client Android.Trojan.AndroRAT.B\n\n695a9f7bb0d7ecb810fe8a3dbe90a173 it.cyprus.client Android.Trojan.AndroRAT.B\n\n6e83b72fcb0abf9e65a48d405f739e93 it.cyprus.client Android.Trojan.AndroRAT.B\n\n667452e44935325c2b20a3d7204efe3b it assistenzaumts update Android Trojan AndroRAT B\n\n\n-----\n\n83c90e931a1a9b249b2f9ce8bf5ecd0b it.assistenzaumts.update Android.Trojan.AndroRAT.ZA\n\n88e8e4ff540fb881d1300f9759026904 it.assistenzaumts.update Android.Trojan.AndroRAT.ZA\n\n**_Note: This article is based on technical information provided courtesy of Bitdefender Researchers Alin Barbatei and Marius Mihai_**\n**_Tivadar, Team Leader â€“ Malware Research._**\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[industry news](http://10.10.0.46/blog/hotforsecurity/tag/industry-news/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Liviu ARSENE\n\nLiviu Arsene is the proud owner of the secret to the fountain of never-ending energy.
