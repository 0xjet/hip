    "plain_text": "# Canadian Police Raid ‘Orcus RAT’ Author\n\n**[krebsonsecurity.com/2019/04/canadian-police-raid-orcus-rat-author/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/04/canadian-police-raid-orcus-rat-author/)**\n\nCanadian police last week raided the residence of a Toronto software developer behind\n“Orcus RAT,” a product that’s been marketed on underground forums and used in countless\nmalware attacks since its creation in 2015. Its author maintains Orcus is a\nlegitimate Remote Administration Tool that is merely being abused, but security experts say\nit includes multiple features more typically seen in malware known as\na Remote Access Trojan.\n\nAn advertisement for Orcus RAT.\n\nAs [first detailed by KrebsOnSecurity in July 2016, Orcus is the brainchild of](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/07/canadian-man-is-author-of-popular-orcus-rat/) **John “Armada”**\n**Revesz, a Toronto resident who until recently maintained and sold the RAT under the**\ncompany name Orcus Technologies.\n\n[In an “official press release” posted to pastebin.com on Mar. 31, 2019, Revesz said his](https://pastebin.com/JgZpxwpf)\ncompany recently was the subject of an international search warrant executed jointly by\nthe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Canadian Radio-television and\n**Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).**\n\n“In this process authorities seized numerous backup hard drives [containing] a large portion\nof Orcus Technologies business, and practices,” Revesz wrote. “Data inclusive on these\ndrives include but are not limited to: User information inclusive of user names, real names,\nfinancial transactions, and further. The arrests and searches expand to an international\ninvestigation at this point, including countries as America, Germany, Australia, Canada and\npotentially more.”\n\nReached via email, Revesz declined to say whether he was arrested in connection with the\nsearch warrant, a copy of which he shared with KrebsOnSecurity. In response to an inquiry\nfrom this office, the RCMP stopped short of naming names, but said “we can confirm that our\n\n\n-----\n\nNational Division Cybercrime Investigative Team did execute a search warrant at a Toronto\nlocation last week.”\n\nThe RCMP said the raid was part of an international coordinated effort with the Federal\nBureau of Investigation and the Australian Federal Police, as part of “a series of ongoing,\nparallel investigations into Remote Access Trojan (RAT) technology. This type of malicious\nsoftware (malware) enables remote access to Canadian computers, without their users’\nconsent and can lead to the subsequent installation of other malware and theft of personal\ninformation.”\n\n“The CRTC executed a warrant under Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) and the\nRCMP National Division executed a search warrant under the Criminal Code respectively,”\n[reads a statement published last week by the Canadian government. “Tips from international](https://www.canada.ca/en/radio-television-telecommunications/news/2019/03/crtc-and-rcmp-national-division-execute-warrants-in-malware-investigation.html)\nprivate cyber security firms triggered the investigation.”\n\nRevesz maintains his software was designed for legitimate use only and for system\nadministrators seeking more powerful, full-featured ways to remotely manage multiple PCs\naround the globe. He’s also said he’s not responsible for how licensed customers use his\nproducts, and that he actively kills software licenses for customers found to be using it for\nonline fraud.\n\nYet the [list of features and plugins advertised for this RAT includes functionality that goes](https://web.archive.org/web/20170602061727/https://orcustechnologies.com/features.html)\nsignificantly beyond what one might see in a traditional remote administration tool, such as\nDDoS-for-hire capabilities, and the ability to disable the light indicator on webcams so as not\nto alert the target that the RAT is active.\n\n“It can also implement a watchdog that restarts the server component or even trigger a Blue\nScreen of Death (BSOD) if the someone tries to kill its process,” wrote researchers at\nsecurity firm Fortinet in [a Dec. 2017 analysis of the RAT. “This makes it harder for targets to](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/a-peculiar-case-of-orcus-rat-targeting-bitcoin-investors.html)\nremove it from their systems. These are, of course, on top of the obviously ominous features\nsuch as password retrieval and key logging that are normally seen in Remote Access\nTrojans.”\n\n[As KrebsOnSecurity noted in 2016, in conjunction with his RAT Revesz also sold and](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/07/canadian-man-is-author-of-popular-orcus-rat/)\nmarketed a bulletproof “dynamic DNS service” that promised not to keep any records of\ncustomer activity.\n\n[Revesz appears to have a flair for the dramatic, and has periodically emailed this author over](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10160525561715403&set=pb.753335402.-2207520000.1554220457.&type=3&theater)\nthe years. Sometimes, the missives were taunting, or vaguely ominous and threatening. Like\nthe time he reached out to say he was hiring a private investigator to find and track me. Still\nother unbidden communications from Revesz were friendly, even helpful with timely news\ntips.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to Revesz himself, he is no stranger to the Canadian legal system. In June 2018,\nRevesz shared court documents indicating he has been involved in multiple physical assault\ncharges since 2007, including “7 domestic disputes between partners as well as incidents\nwith his parents.”\n\n“I am not your A-typical computer geek, Brian,” he wrote in a 2018 email. “I tend to have a\nviolent nature, and have both Martial arts and Military training. So, I suppose it is really good\nthat I took your article with a grain of salt instead of actually really getting upset.”\n\nThe sale and marketing of remote administration tools is not illegal in the United States, and\nindeed there are plenty of such tools sold by legitimate companies to help computer experts\nremotely administer computers.\n\nHowever, these tools tend to be viewed by prosecutors as malware and spyware when their\nproprietors advertise them as hacking devices and provide customer support aimed at\nhelping buyers deploy the RATs stealthily and evade detection by anti-malware programs.\n\n[Last year, a 21-year-old Kentucky man pleaded guilty to authoring and distributing a popular](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/luminositylink-rat-author-pleads-guilty/)\nhacking tool called “LuminosityLink,” which experts say was used by thousands of\ncustomers to gain access to tens of thousands of computers across 78 countries worldwide.\n\nAlso in 2018, 27-year-old Arkansas resident Taylor Huddleston was sentenced to three\nyears in jail for making and selling the “NanoCore RAT,” which was being used to spy on\nwebcams and steal passwords from systems running the software.\n\nIn many previous law enforcement investigations targeting RAT developers and sellers,\ninvestigators also have targeted customers of these products. In 2014, the U.S. Justice\nDepartment announced a series of actions against more than 100 people accused of\npurchasing and using “Blackshades,” a cheap and powerful RAT that the U.S. government\nsaid was used to infect more than a half million computers worldwide.\n\n\n-----\n\nEarlier this year, Revesz [posted on Twitter that he was making the source code for Orcus](https://twitter.com/OrcusTech)\nRAT publicly available, and focusing his attention on developing a new and improved RAT\nproduct.\n\nMeanwhile on Hackforums[.]net — the forum where Orcus was principally advertised and\nsold — members and customers expressed concern that authorities would soon be visiting\nOrcus RAT customers, posts that were deleted almost as quickly by the Hackforums\nadministrator.\n\nAs if in acknowledgement of that concern, in the Pastebin press release published this week\nRevesz warned people away from using Orcus RAT, and added some choice advice for\nothers who would follow his path.\n\n“Orcus is no longer to be considered safe or secure solution to Remote Administrative\n[needs,” he wrote, pointing to a screenshot of a court order he says came from one of the](https://i.imgur.com/UdfIj0l.jpg)\npolice investigators, which requires him to abstain from accessing Hackforums or Orcusrelated sites. “Please move away from this software without delay. It has been a pleasure\ngetting to know everyone in my time online, and I hope you all can take my words as a life\nlesson. Stay safe, don’t do stupid shit.”\n\n\n-----",
