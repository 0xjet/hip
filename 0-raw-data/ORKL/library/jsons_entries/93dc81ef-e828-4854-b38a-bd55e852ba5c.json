    "plain_text": "Cyber Threats to Mobile Phones\nPaul Ruggiero and Jon Foote\n\nMobile Threats Are Increasing\nSmartphones, or mobile phones with advanced capabilities like those of personal computers\n(PCs), are appearing in more people’s pockets, purses, and briefcases. Smartphones’ popularity\nand relatively lax security have made them attractive targets for attackers. According to a report\npublished earlier this year, smartphones recently outsold PCs for the first time, and attackers\nhave been exploiting this expanding market by using old techniques along with new ones. 1 One\nexample is this year’s Valentine’s Day attack, in which attackers distributed a mobile picturesharing application that secretly sent premium-rate text messages from the user’s mobile phone.\nOne study found that, from 2009 to 2010, the number of new vulnerabilities in mobile operating\nsystems jumped 42 percent. 2 The number and sophistication of attacks on mobile phones is\nincreasing, and countermeasures are slow to catch up.\nSmartphones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) give users mobile access to email, the\ninternet, GPS navigation, and many other applications. However, smartphone security has not\nkept pace with traditional computer security. Technical security measures, such as firewalls,\nantivirus, and encryption, are uncommon on mobile phones, and mobile phone operating systems\nare not updated as frequently as those on personal computers. 3 Mobile social networking\napplications sometimes lack the detailed privacy controls of their PC counterparts.\nUnfortunately, many smartphone users do not recognize these security shortcomings. Many users\nfail to enable the security software that comes with their phones, and they believe that surfing the\ninternet on their phones is as safe as or safer than surfing on their computers. 4\nMeanwhile, mobile phones are becoming more and more valuable as targets for attack. People\nare using smartphones for an increasing number of activities and often store sensitive data, such\nas email, calendars, contact information, and passwords, on the devices. Mobile applications for\n\n1\n\nPandaLabs. “Quarterly Report PandaLabs (January-March 2011).” http://press.pandasecurity.com/wpcontent/uploads/2011/04/PandaLabs-Report-Q1-2011.pdf\n2\nSymantec. “Symantec Report Finds Cyber Threats Skyrocket in Volume and Sophistication.”\nhttp://www.symantec.com/about/news/release/article.jsp?prid=20110404_03\n3\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology. “Guidelines on Cell Phone and PDA Security (SP 800-124).”\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-124/SP800-124.pdf\n4\nTrend Micro. “Smartphone Users: Not Smart Enough About Security.”\nhttp://trendmicro.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&news_item=738&type=archived&year=2009\n© 2011 Carnegie Mellon University. Produced for US-CERT, a government organization.\n\n1\n\nsocial networking keep a wealth of personal information. Recent innovations in mobile\ncommerce have enabled users to conduct many transactions from their smartphone, such as\npurchasing goods and applications over wireless networks, redeeming coupons and tickets,\nbanking, processing point-of-sale payments, and even paying at cash registers.\n\nTypical Attacks Leverage Portability and Similarity to PCs\nMobile phones share many of the vulnerabilities of PCs. However, the attributes that make\nmobile phones easy to carry, use, and modify open them to a range of attacks.\n•\n\nPerhaps most simply, the very portability of mobile phones and PDAs makes them easy\nto steal. The owner of a stolen phone could lose all the data stored on it, from personal\nidentifiers to financial and corporate data. Worse, a sophisticated attacker with enough\ntime can defeat most security features of mobile phones and gain access to any\ninformation they store. 5\n\n•\n\nMany seemingly legitimate software applications, or apps, are malicious. 6 Anyone can\ndevelop apps for some of the most popular mobile operating systems, and mobile service\nproviders may offer third-party apps with little or no evaluation of their safety. Sources\nthat are not affiliated with mobile service providers may also offer unregulated apps that\naccess locked phone capabilities. Some users “root” or “jailbreak” their devices,\nbypassing operating system lockout features to install these apps.\n\n•\n\nEven legitimate smartphone software can be exploited. Mobile phone software and\nnetwork services have vulnerabilities, just like their PC counterparts do. For years,\nattackers have exploited mobile phone software to eavesdrop, crash phone software, or\nconduct other attacks. 7 A user may trigger such an attack through some explicit action,\nsuch as clicking a maliciously designed link that exploits a vulnerability in a web\nbrowser. A user may also be exposed to attack passively, however, simply by using a\ndevice that has a vulnerable application or network service running in the background. 8\n\n•\n\nPhishing attacks use electronic communications to trick users into installing malicious\nsoftware or giving away sensitive information. Email phishing is a common attack on\nPCs, and it is just as dangerous on email-enabled mobile phones. Mobile phone users are\nalso vulnerable to phishing voice calls (“vishing”) and SMS/MMS messages\n(“smishing”). 9 These attacks target feature phones (mobile phones without advanced data\nand wireless capabilities) as well as smartphones, and they sometimes try to trick users\n\n5\n\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology. “Guidelines on Cell Phone and PDA Security (SP 800-124).”\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-124/SP800-124.pdf\n6\nFor example, two attacks in March and May 2011 made several Trojans, or seemingly legitimate apps bundled\nwith malicious software, available in an official app store. The Trojans were downloaded tens of thousands of times\nbefore being removed from the store and users’ phones.\n7\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology. “Guidelines on Cell Phone and PDA Security (SP 800-124).”\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-124/SP800-124.pdf\n8\nJohn Cox. “iPhone on Wi-Fi Vulnerable to Security Attack.” http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipoditunes/news/index.cfm?rss&newsid=27777\n9\nUS-CERT. “Technical Information Paper-TIP-10-105-01: Cyber Threats to Mobile Devices.” http://www.uscert.gov/reading_room/TIP10-105-01.pdf\n2\n\ninto receiving fraudulent charges on their mobile phone bill. Phishers often increase their\nattacks after major current events, crafting their communications to look like news stories\nor solicitations for charitable donations. Spammers used this strategy after the March\n2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. 10\n\nConsequences of a Mobile Attack Can Be Severe\nMany users may consider mobile phone security to be less important than the security of their\nPCs, but the consequences of attacks on mobile phones can be just as severe. Malicious software\ncan make a mobile phone a member of a network of devices that can be controlled by an attacker\n(a “botnet”). Malicious software can also send device information to attackers and perform other\nharmful commands. Mobile phones can also spread viruses to PCs that they are connected to.\nLosing a mobile phone used to mean only the loss of contact information, call histories, text\nmessages, and perhaps photos. However, in more recent years, losing a smartphone can also\njeopardize financial information stored on the device in banking and payment apps, as well as\nusernames and passwords used to access apps and online services. If the phone is stolen,\nattackers could use this information to access the user’s bank account or credit card account. An\nattacker could also steal, publicly reveal, or sell any personal information extracted from the\ndevice, including the user’s information, information about contacts, and GPS locations. Even if\nthe victim recovers the device, he or she may receive many spam emails and SMS/MMS\nmessages and may become the target for future phishing attacks.\nSome personal and business services add a layer of authentication by calling a user’s mobile\nphone or sending an additional password via SMS before allowing the user to log onto the\nservice’s website. A stolen mobile phone gets an attacker one step closer to accessing the\nservices as the user. If the device contains the owner’s username and password for the service,\nthe attacker would have everything necessary to access the service.\n\nTake Steps to Protect Your Mobile Phone\nAlthough mobile phones are taking on more capabilities formerly available only on PCs,\ntechnical security solutions for mobile phones are not as sophisticated or widespread as those for\nPCs. This means that the bulk of mobile phone security relies on the user making intelligent,\ncautious choices. Even the most careful users can still fall victim to attacks on their mobile\nphones. However, following best practices regarding mobile phone security can reduce the\nlikelihood or consequences of an attack.\n•\n\nWhen choosing a mobile phone, consider its security features. Ask the service\nprovider if the device offers file encryption, the ability for the provider to find and wipe\nthe device remotely, the ability to delete known malicious apps remotely, and\nauthentication features such as device access passwords. If you back up your phone data\nto a PC, look for an option to encrypt the backup. If you plan to use the device for VPN\n\n10\n\nMathew Maniyara. “Phishers Have No Mercy for Japan.” http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/phishers-haveno-mercy-japan\n3\n\naccess, as some users do to access work networks, ask the provider if the device supports\ncertificate-based authentication.\n•\n\nConfigure the device to be more secure. Many smartphones have a password feature\nthat locks the device until the correct PIN or password is entered. Enable this feature, and\nchoose a reasonably complex password. Enable encryption, remote wipe capabilities, and\nantivirus software if available.\n\n•\n\nConfigure web accounts to use secure connections. Accounts for certain websites can\nbe configured to use secure, encrypted connections (look for “HTTPS” or “SSL” in\naccount options pages). Enabling this feature deters attackers from eavesdropping on web\nsessions. Many popular mail and social networking sites include this option.\n\n•\n\nDo not follow links sent in suspicious email or text messages. Such links may lead to\nmalicious websites.\n\n•\n\nLimit exposure of your mobile phone number. Think carefully before posting your\nmobile phone number to a public website. Attackers can use software to collect mobile\nphone numbers from the web and then use those numbers to target attacks.\n\n•\n\nCarefully consider what information you want stored on the device. Remember that\nwith enough time, sophistication, and access to the device, any attacker could obtain your\nstored information.\n\n•\n\nBe choosy when selecting and installing apps. Do a little research on apps before\ninstalling them. Check what permissions the app requires. If the permissions seem\nbeyond what the app should require, do not install the app; it could be a Trojan horse,\ncarrying malicious code in an attractive package.\n\n•\n\nMaintain physical control of the device, especially in public or semi-public places.\nThe portability of mobile phones makes them easy to lose or steal.\n\n•\n\nDisable interfaces that are not currently in use, such as Bluetooth, infrared, or WiFi. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in software that use these interfaces.\n\n•\n\nSet Bluetooth-enabled devices to non-discoverable. When in discoverable mode, your\nBluetooth-enabled devices are visible to other nearby devices, which may alert an\nattacker or infected device to target you. When in non-discoverable mode, your\nBluetooth-enabled devices are invisible to other unauthenticated devices.\n\n•\n\nAvoid joining unknown Wi-Fi networks and using public Wi-Fi hotspots. Attackers\ncan create phony Wi-Fi hotspots designed to attack mobile phones and may patrol public\nWi-Fi networks for unsecured devices. Also, enable encryption on your home Wi-Fi\nnetwork. 11\n\n•\n\nDelete all information stored in a device prior to discarding it. Check the website of\nthe device’s manufacturer for information about securely deleting data. Your mobile\nphone provider may also have useful information on securely wiping your device.\n\n11\n\nSee “US-CERT Cyber Security Tip ST05-003 – Securing Wireless Networks” at http://www.uscert.gov/cas/tips/ST05-003.html.\n4\n\n•\n\nBe careful when using social networking applications. These apps may reveal more\npersonal information than intended, and to unintended parties. Be especially careful when\nusing services that track your location.\n\n•\n\nDo not “root” or “jailbreak” the device. Third-party device firmware, which is\nsometimes used to get access to device features that are locked by default, can contain\nmalicious code or unintentional security vulnerabilities. Altering the firmware could also\nprevent the device from receiving future operating system updates, which often contain\nvaluable security updates and other feature upgrades.\n\nAct Quickly if Your Mobile Phone or PDA Is Stolen\n•\n\nReport the loss to your organization and/or mobile service provider. If your phone or\nPDA was issued by an organization or is used to access private data, notify your\norganization of the loss immediately. If your personal phone or PDA was lost, contact\nyour mobile phone service provider as soon as possible to deter malicious use of your\ndevice and minimize fraudulent charges.\n\n•\n\nReport the loss or theft to local authorities. Depending on the situation, it may be\nappropriate to notify relevant staff and/or local police.\n\n•\n\nChange account credentials. If you used your phone or PDA to access any remote\nresources, such as corporate networks or social networking sites, revoke all credentials\nthat were stored on the lost device. This may involve contacting your IT department to\nrevoke issued certificates or logging into websites to change your password.\n\n•\n\nIf necessary, wipe the phone. Some mobile service providers offer remote wiping,\nwhich allows you or your provider to remotely delete all data on the phone.\n\nAdditional Resources\nUS-CERT Resources\n•\n\n“Technical Information Paper: Cyber Threats to Mobile Devices”\n(http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/TIP10-105-01.pdf)\n\n•\n\n“Protecting Portable Devices: Physical Security”\n(http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-017.html)\n\n•\n\n“Protecting Portable Devices: Data Security”\n(http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-020.html)\n\n•\n\n“Securing Wireless Networks” (http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST05-003.html)\n\n•\n\n“Cybersecurity for Electronic Devices” (http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST05-017.html)\n\n•\n\n“Defending Cell Phones and PDAs Against Attack”\n(http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST06-007.html)\n\n5\n\nOther Resources\n•\n\n“Mobile Device Security: Threats, Risks, and Actions to Take” (podcast,\nhttp://www.cert.org/podcast/show/20100831frederick.html)\n\n•\n\nInternet Crime Schemes: Phishing/Spoofing\n(http://www.ic3.gov/crimeschemes.aspx#item-14)\n\n•\n\nInternet Crime Schemes: Identity Theft (http://www.ic3.gov/crimeschemes.aspx#item-9)\n\n6",
