Based on what we currently know, the security\ncommunity should feel good about the collective work done to limit the damage done by this\nwave of attacks. As we have notified our targeted customers and watched closely for other\nreports, we are not seeing evidence of any significant number of compromised organizations\nat this time. More importantly, antivirus services, like Microsoft Defender Antivirus, and\nendpoint detection and response products, such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, are\nidentifying and protecting against the malware being used in this wave of attacks and are\nworking in combination with Microsoft Defender for Office 365. It is important for all users to\nemploy basic cybersecurity hygiene, including using multi-factor authentication, using\nantivirus/antimalware software and being careful not to click on links in email, unless you can\nconfirm reliability to minimize the risk of being phished. We will continue to monitor the\nsituation.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis week we observed cyberattacks by the threat actor Nobelium targeting government\nagencies, think tanks, consultants, and non-governmental organizations. This wave of\nattacks targeted approximately 3,000 email accounts at more than 150 different\norganizations. While organizations in the United States received the largest share of attacks,\ntargeted victims span at least 24 countries. At least a quarter of the targeted organizations\nwere involved in international development, humanitarian, and human rights work. Nobelium,\noriginating from Russia, is the same actor behind the attacks on SolarWinds customers in\n2020. These attacks appear to be a continuation of multiple efforts by Nobelium to target\ngovernment agencies involved in foreign policy as part of intelligence gathering efforts.\n\nNobelium launched this week’s attacks by gaining access to the Constant Contact account\nof USAID. Constant Contact is a service used for email marketing. From there, the actor was\nable to distribute phishing emails that looked authentic but included a link that, when\nclicked, inserted a malicious file used to distribute a backdoor we call NativeZone. This\nbackdoor could enable a wide range of activities from stealing data to infecting other\ncomputers on a network. You can read more about the technical aspects of these\nattacks in [this blog post from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC).](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/)\n\nMany of the attacks targeting our customers were blocked automatically, and Windows\nDefender is blocking the malware involved in this attack. We’re also in the process of\nnotifying all of our customers who have been targeted. We detected this attack and identified\nvictims through the ongoing work of the MSTIC team in tracking nation-state actors. We have\nno reason to believe these attacks involve any exploit against or vulnerability in\nMicrosoft’s products or services.\n\nThese attacks are notable for three reasons.\n\nFirst, when coupled with the attack on SolarWinds, it’s clear that part of Nobelium’s playbook\nis to gain access to trusted technology providers and infect their customers. By piggybacking\non software updates and now mass email providers, Nobelium increases the chances\nof collateral damage in espionage operations and undermines trust in the technology\necosystem.\n\nSecond, perhaps unsurprisingly, Nobelium’s activities and that of similar actors tend to track\nwith issues of concern to the country from which they are operating. This\ntime Nobelium targeted many humanitarian and human rights organizations. At the height of\n[the Covid-19 pandemic, Russian actor Strontium targeted healthcare organizations involved](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/11/13/health-care-cyberattacks-covid-19-paris-peace-forum/)\n[in vaccines. In 2019, Strontium targeted sporting and anti-doping organizations. And we’ve](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/10/28/cyberattacks-sporting-anti-doping/)\n[previously disclosed activity by Strontium and other actors targeting major elections in the](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/10/cyberattacks-us-elections-trump-biden/)\nU.S. and elsewhere. This is yet another example of how cyberattacks have become the tool\nof choice for a growing number of nation-states to accomplish a wide variety of political\nobjectives, with the focus of these attacks by Nobelium on human rights and humanitarian\norganizations.\n\n\n-----\n\nThird, nation-state cyberattacks aren t slowing. We need clear rules governing nation-state\nconduct in cyberspace and clear expectations of the consequences for violation of those\n[rules. We must continue to rally around progress made by the Paris Call for Trust and](https://pariscall.international/en/)\nSecurity in Cyberspace, and more widely adopt the recommendations of the Cybersecurity\nTech Accord, and the [CyberPeace Institute. But, we need to do more. Microsoft will continue](https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/)\nto work with willing governments and the private sector to advance the cause of digital\npeace.\n\nTags: [cyberattacks,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cyberattacks/) [CyberPeace Institute,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cyberpeace-institute/) [cybersecurity,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cybersecurity-2/) [MSTIC,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/mstic/) [Nobelium](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/nobelium/)\n\n\n-----",
