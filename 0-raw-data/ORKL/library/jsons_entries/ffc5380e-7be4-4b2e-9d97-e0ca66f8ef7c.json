    "plain_text": "# Conti Ransomware Nets at Least $25.5 Million in Four Months\n\n**[elliptic.co/blog/conti-ransomware-nets-at-least-25.5-million-in-four-months](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/conti-ransomware-nets-at-least-25.5-million-in-four-months)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Elliptic Intel**\n\nElliptic’s analysis of newly-uncovered ransomware transactions has revealed that Conti’s\nillicit activities have netted the group at least $25.5 million since July 2021, which includes\none ransom payment of over $7 million in November 2021.\n\nIn a [collaboration with threat intelligence company Prodaft, Elliptic has analysed Bitcoin](https://www.prodaft.com/resource/detail/conti-ransomware-group-depth-analysis)\naddresses connected to 14 ransomware attacks conducted by Conti between July 1st and\nNovember 5th 2021. These addresses were identified by Prodaft after they were able to\naccess Conti’s management admin portal.\n\nConti ransomware was first observed in 2020 and is believed to be the successor to Ryuk,\nwhich has been active since 2018. Both Conti and Ryuk are operated by the Russian\ncybercrime group, Wizard Spider.\n\nConti has attacked numerous high profile victims, including the Japanese electronics supplier\nJVCKenwood, and London-based high society jeweller Graff. In September 2021, Prodaft’s\nthreat intelligence team observed a surge of ransomware attacks attributable to Conti, which\nis currently one of the most active ransomware strains.\n\nOf the 14 attacks analysed by Elliptic, 50% resulted in a payment to Conti, though the\ngroup’s overall success rate is likely to be considerably lower. Over the same time period,\nConti’s public leak site listed more than 130 victims.\n\nConti uses the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model. RaaS Bitcoin transactions\ncharacteristically split — as the proceeds of each ransom payment is distributed between the\nransomware operator and the affiliate that infected the victim — with the exact percentage\nsplit differing between RaaS groups. In most instances, the affiliates are awarded the\nmajority of the ransom payment, with the ransomware operators taking a smaller\npercentage.\n\nAnalysing the ransom payment addresses identified by Prodaft resulted in the identification\nof a consolidation cluster, which has received a 22.5% split of several of the ransom\npayments, believed to represent the operator’s share. In total, Conti received at least $25.5\nmillion (more than 500 BTC) in ransom payments since July 2021, $6.2 million of which was\nkept by the Conti operator.\n\n\n-----\n\n**IMG 1: Screenshot from Elliptic’s cryptocurrency investigations software, Forensics —**\n**_showing the destination of the Conti operator’s share of the ransom payments_**\n\nApart from one outgoing payment of 0.07 Bitcoin which was sent from the consolidation\ncluster to a prominent exchange in August 2021, the Conti operator has not sent any of the\nBitcoins in this wallet to services such as exchanges where they could cash-out their\nproceeds. Blockchain records indicate that the remaining 123.06 Bitcoin is currently held in\nan unhosted wallet.\n\nElliptic also tracked the ransomware proceeds received by Conti affiliates. One identified\nwallet has received payments from both Conti and DarkSide, which may indicate that an\nindividual has worked as an affiliate for both of these groups.\n\n**IMG 2: Screenshot from Elliptic’s cryptocurrency investigations software, Forensics —**\n**_showing the destination of the affiliates’ share of the Conti ransom payments_**\n\n\n-----\n\nConti affiliates appear to conduct a sophisticated money laundering operation, avoiding\nobvious consolidation of funds. Despite this, Elliptic has identified affiliate funds being sent to\nexchanges, coin swaps, privacy enhancing wallets including Wasabi, and the Russianlanguage darknet market Hydra.\n\n**The Importance of Countering Ransomware Groups and How Elliptic Can Help**\n\nCountering ransomware has become a top priority for the world’s largest financial\njurisdictions, with the United States’ OFAC recently imposing sanctions on two\ncryptocurrency exchanges believed to be laundering ransomware proceeds. The latest,\nagainst [Latvia-based Chatex, coincided with an international law enforcement operation](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/crypto-addresses-holding-nfts-worth-532k-are-among-latest-sanctioned-by-ofac)\nagainst REvil, another ransomware group.\n\nVirtual asset service providers and financial institutions have a legal and financial\nresponsibility to ensure that they have effective transaction screening tools in place to\nprevent the facilitation of ransomware-related money laundering. Any attempt by Conti\noperators or affiliates to cash out presents a risk to VASPs.\n\n[At Elliptic, we provide blockchain analytics solutions to assist regulated cryptoasset](https://www.elliptic.co/solutions)\nbusinesses and financial institutions in preventing exposure to illicit actors such as\nransomware groups.\n\nElliptic’s clients can visualise and investigate wallets and transactions, including ransomware\n[payments, using Elliptic Forensics, in order to ‘follow the money’ to its ultimate source or](https://www.elliptic.co/solutions/crypto-investigations)\n[destination.
