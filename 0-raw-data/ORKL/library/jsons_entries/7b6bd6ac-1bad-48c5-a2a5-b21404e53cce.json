When threat actors exploit this type of bug, it\ncan cause the program to crash while at the same time allowing commands to be executed\non the device without permission.\n\nThese bugs are critical because they could allow a remote attacker to execute almost any\ncommand, including the downloading of malware to provide further access to the device.\n\nThe zero-day vulnerabilities fixed by Mozilla are:\n\n\n-----\n\n**CVE-2022-26485: Use-after-free in XSLT parameter processing - Removing an XSLT**\nparameter during processing could have lead to an exploitable use-after-free. We\nhave had reports of attacks in the wild abusing this flaw.\n**CVE-2022-26486: Use-after-free in WebGPU IPC Framework - An unexpected**\nmessage in the WebGPU IPC framework could lead to a use-after-free and\nexploitable sandbox escape. We have had reports of attacks in the wild abusing this\nflaw.\n\n[As Mozilla's security advisory explains, the Firefox developers are aware of \"reports of](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2022-09/#CVE-2022-26485)\nattacks in the wild\" actively exploiting these vulnerabilities.\n\nWhile Mozilla has not shared how threat actors use these zero-day vulnerabilities in attacks,\nit was likely done by redirecting Firefox users to maliciously crafted web pages.\n\nThese vulnerabilities were discovered and disclosed to Mozilla by Chinese cybersecurity\ncompany Qihoo 360 ATA.\n\nDue to the critical nature of these bugs, and they are being actively exploited, it is strongly\nrecommended that all Firefox users update their browsers immediately.\n\nYou can also download the latest version of Mozilla Firefox for Windows, macOS, and Linux\nfrom the following links:\n\n[Firefox 97.0.2 for Windows 64-bit](https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest-ssl&os=win64&lang=en-US)\n[Firefox 97.0.2 for Windows 32-bit](https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest-ssl&os=win&lang=en-US)\n[Firefox 97.0.2 for macOS](https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest-ssl&os=osx&lang=en-US)\n[Firefox 97.0.2 for Linux 64-bit](https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest-ssl&os=linux64&lang=en-US)\n[Firefox 97.0.2 for Linux 32-bit](https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest-ssl&os=linux&lang=en-US)\n\nUsers can manually check for new updates by going to the Firefox menu > Help > About\n**Firefox. Firefox will then automatically check for and install the latest update and prompt**\nyou to restart your browser.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Google Chrome emergency update fixes zero-day used in attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-chrome-emergency-update-fixes-zero-day-used-in-attacks/)\n\n[Mozilla fixes Firefox, Thunderbird zero-days exploited at Pwn2Own](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mozilla-fixes-firefox-thunderbird-zero-days-exploited-at-pwn2own/)\n\n[CISA adds 41 vulnerabilities to list of bugs used in cyberattacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-adds-41-vulnerabilities-to-list-of-bugs-used-in-cyberattacks/)\n\n[Cisco urges admins to patch IOS XR zero-day exploited in attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisco-urges-admins-to-patch-ios-xr-zero-day-exploited-in-attacks/)\n\n[Microsoft Teams, Windows 11 hacked on first day of Pwn2Own](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-teams-windows-11-hacked-on-first-day-of-pwn2own/)\n\n[Actively Exploited](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/actively-exploited/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Firefox](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/firefox/)\n[Mozilla](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/mozilla/)\n[Vulnerability](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/vulnerability/)\n[Web Browser](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/web-browser/)\n[Zero-Day](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/zero-day/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
