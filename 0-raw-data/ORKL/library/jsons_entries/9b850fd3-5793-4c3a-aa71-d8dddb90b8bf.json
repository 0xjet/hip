Recently we detected a new activity\ninvolving the same malware and a connection to legitimate software developed by ASUS\nCloud Corporation.\n\n[The Plead malware is a backdoor which, according to Trend Micro, is used by the](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/following-trail-blacktech-cyber-espionage-campaigns/)\nBlackTech group in targeted attacks. The BlackTech group is primarily focused on\ncyberespionage in Asia.\n\nThe new activity described in this blogpost was detected by ESET in Taiwan, where the\nPlead malware has always been most actively deployed.\n\n## What has happened?\n\nAt the end of April 2019, ESET researchers utilizing ESET telemetry observed multiple\nattempts to deploy Plead malware in an unusual way. Specifically, the Plead backdoor was\ncreated and executed by a legitimate process named AsusWSPanel.exe. This process\nbelongs to the Windows client for a cloud storage service called ASUS WebStorage. As\nseen in Figure 1, the executable file is digitally signed by ASUS Cloud Corporation.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. The AsusWSPanel.exe code-signing certificate_\n\nAll observed Plead samples had the following file name: Asus Webstorage Upate.exe [sic].\nOur research confirmed that the AsusWSPanel.exe module of ASUS WebStorage can\ncreate files with such filenames during the software update process, as seen in Figure 2.\n\n_Figure 2. Decompiled code of the ASUS WebStorage client_\n\nThere are several possible explanations for why legitimate software could create and\nexecute the Plead malware.\n\n## Scenario 1 – Supply chain attack\n\n\n-----\n\nA supply chain opens unlimited opportunities for attackers to stealthily compromise a large\nnumber of targets at the same time: that’s why the number of supply-chain attacks is\n[increasing. In recent years ESET researchers analyzed such cases as M.E.Doc,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/07/04/analysis-of-telebots-cunning-backdoor/) Elmedia\nPlayer, [VestaCP,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/10/18/new-linux-chachaddos-malware-distributed-servers-vestacp-installed/) [Statcounter, and the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/11/06/supply-chain-attack-cryptocurrency-exchange-gate-io/) [Gaming industry.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/03/11/gaming-industry-scope-attackers-asia/)\n\nFor malware researchers, it’s not always easy to detect and confirm a specific supply-chain\nattack; sometimes there are not enough pieces of evidence to prove it.\n\nWhen we think about the possibility of an ASUS WebStorage supply-chain attack, we\nshould take into account the following points:\n\nLegitimate ASUS WebStorage binaries were delivered via the same update\nmechanism\nCurrently, we are not aware that ASUS WebStorage servers are used as C&C servers\nor have served malicious binaries\nAttackers used standalone malware files instead of incorporating malicious\nfunctionality inside legitimate software\n\nTherefore, we consider the hypothesis of a possible supply-chain attack to be a less likely\nscenario; however, we can’t fully discount it.\n\n## Scenario 2 – Man-in-the-middle attack\n\n[The ASUS WebStorage software is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack (MitM).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)\nNamely, the software update is requested and transferred using HTTP; once an update is\ndownloaded and ready to execute, the software doesn’t validate its authenticity before\nexecution. Thus, if the update process is intercepted by attackers, they are able to push a\nmalicious update.\n\nESET researchers are familiar with cases when malware was delivered using a MitM attack\nat the ISP level, such as [FinFisher,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/09/21/new-finfisher-surveillance-campaigns/) [StrongPity2, and the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/12/08/strongpity-like-spyware-replaces-finfisher/) [Turla mosquito case.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ESET_Turla_Mosquito.pdf)\n\nAccording to the Trend Micro research mentioned earlier, the attackers behind the Plead\nmalware are compromising vulnerable routers and even using them as C&C servers for the\nmalware.\n\nOur investigation uncovered that most of the affected organizations have routers made by\nthe same producer; moreover, the admin panels of these routers are accessible from the\ninternet. Thus, we believe that a MitM attack at the router level is the most probable\nscenario.\n\nAs mentioned above, the ASUS WebStorage software requests an update using HTTP.\nSpecifically, it sends a request to the update.asuswebstorage.com server, which sends an\nanswer back in XML format. The most important elements in the XML response are the guid\nand the link. The guid element contains the currently available version; the link element\n\n\n-----\n\ncontains the download URL used for the update. The update process is simple: the\nsoftware checks whether the installed version is older than the most recent version; if so,\nthen it requests a binary using the provided URL, as seen in Figure 3.\n\n_Figure 3. A legitimate communication during an update check of the ASUS WebStorage software_\n\nTherefore, attackers could trigger the update by replacing these two elements using their\nown data. This is the exact scenario we actually observed in the wild. As shown in Figure 4,\nattackers inserted a new URL, which points to a malicious file at a compromised gov.tw\ndomain.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. A captured communication during a malicious update of the ASUS WebStorage software_\n\nThe illustration in Figure 5 demonstrates the most likely scenario used to deliver malicious\npayloads to targets through compromised routers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Man-in-the-middle attack scenario_\n\n## Plead backdoor\n\nThe deployed Plead sample is a first-stage downloader. Once executed, it downloads the\nfav.ico file from a server, whose name mimics the official ASUS WebStorage server:\nupdate.asuswebstorage.com.ssmailer[.]com\n\nThe downloaded file contains an image in PNG format and data used by the malware,\nwhich is located right after PNG data. Figure 6 depicts the specific byte sequence (control\nbytes) the malware searches for, and then it uses the next 512 bytes as an RC4 encryption\nkey in order to decrypt the rest of the data.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. The data used by the Plead malware in the downloaded PNG file_\n\nThe decrypted data contains a Windows PE binary, which can be dropped and executed\nusing one of the absolute filenames and paths:\n\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\slui.exe\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\ctfmon.exe\n%TEMP%\\DEV[4_random_chars].TMP\n\nBy writing itself to the Start Menu startup folder, the malware gains persistence – it will be\nloaded each time the current user logs into the system.\n\nThe dropped executable is a second-stage loader, whose purpose is to decrypt shellcode\nfrom its PE resource and execute it in memory. This shellcode loads a third-stage DLL,\nwhose purpose is to get an additional module from a C&C server and execute it. The thirdstage DLL and downloaded module are thoroughly analyzed by JPCERT and published in\n[their blogpost (referred to there as “TSCookie”).](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2018/03/malware-tscooki-7aa0.html)\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nAttackers are constantly looking for new ways to deliver their malware in a stealthier way.\nWe see that supply-chain and man-in-the-middle attacks are used more and more often by\nvarious attackers all around the globe.\n\nThis is why it’s very important for software developers not only to thoroughly monitor their\nenvironment for possible intrusions, but also to implement proper update mechanisms in\ntheir products that are resistant to MitM attacks.\n\nESET researchers notified ASUS Cloud Corporation prior to this publication.\n\n_For any inquiries, or to make sample submissions related to this subject, please contact us_\n_at threatintel@eset.com._\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n**ESET detection names**\n\nWin32/Plead.AP trojan\n\nWin32/Plead.AC trojan\n\n**Plead samples (SHA-1)**\n\n77F785613AAA41E4BF5D8702D8DFBD315E784F3E\n\n322719458BC5DFFEC99C9EF96B2E84397285CD73\n\nF597B3130E26F184028B1BA6B624CF2E2DECAA67\n\n**C&C servers**\n\nupdate.asuswebstorage.com.ssmailer[.]com\n\nwww.google.com.dns-report[.]com\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n\nExecution [T1203](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203/) Exploitation for\nClient Execution\n\n\nBlackTech group exploits a vulnerable\nupdate mechanism in ASUS\nWebStorage software in order to\ndeploy Plead malware in some\nnetworks.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n\nPersistence [T1060](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1060/) Registry Run Keys /\nStartup Folder\n\n\nPlead malware might drop a second\nstage loader in the Start Menu's\nstartup folder.\n\n\nDefense\nEvasion\n\n\n[T1116](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1116/) Code Signing Some Plead malware samples are\nsigned with stolen certificates.\n\n\n[T1027](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/) Obfuscated\nFiles or\nInformation\n\n\nPlead malware\nencrypts its payloads\nwith the RC4\nalgorithm.\n\n\nCredential\nAccess\n\n\n[T1081](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1081/) Credentials in Files BlackTech can deploy a module that\nsteals credentials from the victim's\nbrowser and email clients.\n\n\nDiscovery [T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/) File and Directory\nDiscovery\n\n\nPlead malware allows attackers to\nobtain a list of files.\n\n\n[T1057](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1057/) Process\nDiscovery\n\n\nPlead malware\nallows attackers to\nobtain a list of\nrunning processes\non a system.\n\n\nCommand\nAnd\nControl\n\n\n[T1105](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/) Remote File Copy Plead malware allows attackers to\nupload and download files from its\nC&C.\n\n\n[T1071](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/) Standard\nApplication\nLayer\nProtocol\n\n\nPlead malware uses\nHTTP for\ncommunication with\nits C&C.\n\n\nExfiltration [T1041](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/) Exfiltration Over\nCommand and\nControl Channel\n\n14 May 2019 - 11:30AM\n\n\nData exfiltration is done using the\nalready opened channel with the C&C\nserver.\n\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n\n-----\n\n### Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
