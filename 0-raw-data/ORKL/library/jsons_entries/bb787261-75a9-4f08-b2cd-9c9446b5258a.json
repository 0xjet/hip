We call this_\n_report our “Intelligence Insights” and plan to share a public version of it with the broader_\n_infosec community from here onward._\n\n## Highlights\n\nRose Flamingo dipped its pink talon into the top 10 confirmed threats we detected in August\n2021. Meanwhile, TA551 continues to surge ahead of Cobalt Strike as the most prevalent\nthreat from the last month—and year-to-date for that matter. We’re also continuing to\nobserve a trend of adversaries exploiting enterprise applications for initial access, primarily\nthrough vulnerabilities in WebLogic and Confluence over the last few weeks. Last but\ncertainly not least, “Crypters” are gaining momentum among “as-a-Service” threats and\n[lowering the barrier of entry for adversaries seeking to install remote access trojans (RAT).](https://redcanary.com/blog/misbehaving-rats/)\n\nThe Red Canary Intelligence team offers insights into these threats—and a glimpse into the\n10 most prevalent threats from August—in the latest edition of Intelligence Insights.\n\nTOP THREATS IN AUGUST 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n**August rank** **Threat name** **Percent of customers affected**\n\n\nAugust rank :\n➡ 1\n\nAugust rank :\n⬆ 2\n\nAugust rank :\n⬇ 3\n\nAugust rank :\n⬆ 4\n\nAugust rank :\n⬆ 5*\n\nAugust rank :\n⬇ 5*\n\nAugust rank :\n⬇ 7\n\nAugust rank :\n⬆ 8*\n\nAugust rank :\n⬆ 8*\n\nAugust rank :\n➡ 8*\n\n\nThreat name:\n[TA551](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/ta551/)\n\nThreat name:\n[Cobalt Strike](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/cobalt-strike/)\n\nThreat name:\n[Mimikatz](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/mimikatz/)\n\nThreat name:\n[Yellow Cockatoo](https://redcanary.com/blog/yellow-cockatoo/)\n\nThreat name:\nAdload\n\nThreat name:\nSocGholish\n\nThreat name:\n[Gamarue](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/gamarue/)\n\nThreat name:\nEmpire\n\nThreat name:\nMetasploit Framework\n\nThreat name:\nRose Flamingo\n\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n2.5%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n1.5%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n1.3%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n0.9%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n0.7%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n0.7%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n0.6%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n0.5%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n0.5%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n0.5%\n\n\n⬆ = trending up from July\n⬇= trending down from July\n➡ = no change in rank from July\n\n*Denotes a tie\n\n## Rose Flamingo rises into top 10 threat rankings\n\n\n-----\n\nRose Flamingo is a new activity cluster that we ve identified emerging over the past several\nmonths. We name new activity clusters when we observe overlap across various detections\nthat we are unable to successfully associate to any known threats named by the community.\nRose Flamingo’s initial access occurs via file-sharing websites purporting to provide free or\n“cracked” software. The ZIP files downloaded from these websites have enticing strings in\ntheir names like `free,` `key,` `download,` `license,` `latest,` `iso, or` `crack, and`\ncontain a TXT file with a password for an additional nested ZIP file. The nested ZIP file is\nwhere the trouble really begins, as it contains the initial loader that delivers additional\nmalicious payloads. We observed a variety of payloads, from coinminers to infostealers and\n[even a single instance of ransomware. Other researchers from Sophos and](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/09/01/fake-pirated-software-sites-serve-up-malware-droppers-as-a-service/) [BitDefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/labs/debugging-mosaicloader-one-step-at-a-time)\nhave observed activity that overlaps with what we identify as Rose Flamingo, and we plan\nto release further details on it in the future as this threat emerges.\n\n## TA551 prevails as the most prevalent threat thus far in 2021\n\nTA551, also known as Shathak, is a threat group that uses large-scale phishing campaigns\nto deliver additional malware payloads. It continued to surge ahead in prevalence over the\npast month, overtaking Cobalt Strike as the most prevalent threat in August as well as 2021\noverall. So far this year, nearly 10 percent of all Red Canary customers have encountered a\nTA551 detection. BazarBackdoor was TA551’s payload du jour for most of August, though\nwe were fortunate to catch this threat early enough that we did not encounter any cases of\nBazarBackdoor activity last month. Credit for that early intervention goes to those\nimplementing strong mitigating controls, including restricting access to Office macros and\nblocking traffic to new domains. TA551 was also the #1 most prevalent threat Red Canary\nobserved in 2020, and fortunately the same detection opportunities we shared in our Threat\nDetection Report are still effective in catching this threat.\n\n## Adversaries continue to exploit enterprise applications for initial access\n\nIn August 2021, Red Canary observed adversaries exploiting vulnerabilities in WebLogic\nand Confluence to carry out a variety of follow-on actions in multiple environments. Given\nthe frequency with which vulnerabilities are disclosed and the ease with which adversaries\ncan exploit newly reported weaknesses, particularly in common applications, Red Canary\nfocuses on identifying and detecting the behavior we observe surrounding exploitation of a\nvulnerability, and we recommend others take this approach as well. Understanding the\nthreats we see and the ways in which adversaries operate in compromised networks allows\nus all to protect our networks from malicious activity regardless of the means by which the\nenvironment is accessed.\n\n**WebLogic**\n\n\n-----\n\nA handful of attacks we observed last month involved tactics, techniques, and procedures\n[(TTP) that overlap with those used by an adversary known as Prophet Spider, a threat](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/prophet-spider-exploits-oracle-weblogic-to-facilitate-ransomware-activity/)\ngroup named by CrowdStrike that is known to compromise vulnerable WebLogic servers\nand hand off access to ransomware operators. In campaigns we saw (which were\nconsistent with CrowdStrike’s excellent reporting), the adversary compromised vulnerable\nWebLogic instances, dropped a web shell on victims’ endpoints, and installed various tools.\nWe also identified behavior consistent with ransomware precursor activity in one instance.\n\n### Detection opportunity: Certificate Utility Authority decoding data\n\nThis detection opportunity helped us identify Base64-encoded data that was stored in a\n```\n.txt file being decoded and written to a .jsp web shell file.\n\n```\nProcess = `certutil.exe`\n\n&\n\nCommand_line includes `decode`\n\n_[You can test the efficacy of this detection opportunity by running this Atomic Red Team test](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1140/T1140.md#atomic-test-2---certutil-rename-and-decode)_\n_in Command Prompt_\n\n**Confluence**\n\nWe also saw adversaries exploit a recently disclosed vulnerability in Confluence (CVE2021-26084) and use a variety of tools in an attempt to mine cryptocurrency from victims.\n[Activity we observed was consistent with open source reporting on threats exploiting this](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/atlassian-confluence-flaw-actively-exploited-to-install-cryptominers/)\nvulnerability.\n\n### Detection opportunity: Redirected Base64-encoded commands into bash\n\nThis Linux detection opportunity helped us identify execution of a Base64-encoded\ncommand that was redirected into `bash using brace expansion syntax. This command`\n[initiated the download of z0miner.](https://blog.netlab.360.com/threat-alert-z0miner-is-spreading-quickly-by-exploiting-elasticsearch-and-jenkins-vulnerabilities/)\n\nProcess = `bash`\n\n&\n\nCommand_line includes `base64 -d`\n\n&\n\nCommand_line includes `bash`\n\n\n-----\n\n_[You can test the efficacy of this detection opportunity by running this Atomic Red Team test](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/1513717eb2f9a2b242fb23fb2ed5d7d749201b22/atomics/T1140/T1140.md#atomic-test-5---base64-decoding-with-shell-utilities)_\n_in_ `sh! .`\n\n## “Crypters” become newest “as-a-Service” threat\n\nIn the past few months, we’ve tracked multiple “Crypters-as-a-Service” (CaaS) that facilitate\nthe delivery of malware through various PowerShell obfuscation methods. The CaaS model\nis another addition to the growing market of tools and services geared toward adversaries\nwith lower technical sophistication. These crypters lower the barrier of entry for RAT\ninfections, and tracking them helps us more accurately track use of the crypter versus the\nRAT.\n\nThe first crypter we’ve been tracking is called “HCrypt.” According to our own observations\nand public reporting, adversaries using HCrypt typically drop RATs such as ASyncRAT,\nQuasar RAT, and LimeRAT. Adversaries leveraging HCrypt have been observed gaining\ninitial access via phishing attachments, often leveraging image files (IMG or ISO) containing\na script (VBS or JS) that launches HCrypt. The malicious script downloads an additional\nscript hosted on various publicly accessible sites including archive, cloud hosting, code\nrepositories, and paste sites. This execution chain ultimately leads to a RAT infection.\n\nAnother crypter we’ve been tracking is called “Snip3,” which was first documented in May\n2021. It drops similar RATs to those we observed with HCrypt, including AsyncRAT, Agent\nTesla, and Revenge RAT.\n\n### Detection opportunity: PowerShell command contains “DownloadString”\n\nThis detection opportunity helped us identify HCrypt’s Base64-encoded PowerShell\ncommand to download an additional obfuscated PowerShell script.\n\n\n-----\n\nProcess = `powershell`\n&\nCommand_line includes `downloadstring`\n\n_[You can test the efficacy of this detection opportunity by running this Atomic Red Team test](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/ba0b1a3c355bd9a6722a6fa2ba093121d5eabfce/atomics/T1105/T1105.md#atomic-test-15---file-download-via-powershell)_\n_from PowerShell._\n\nLook familiar?\n\n[If you've run into any of these behaviors on your environment, let us know!](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:blog@redcanary.com)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nDetection and response\n\n### ChromeLoader: a pushy malvertiser\n\nDetection and response\n\n### Intelligence Insights: May 2022\n\nDetection and response\n\n### The Goot cause: Detecting Gootloader and its follow-on activity\n\nDetection and response\n\n### Marshmallows & Kerberoasting\n\n\n-----\n\n**Subscribe to our blog**\n\nOur website uses cookies to provide you with a better browsing experience.
