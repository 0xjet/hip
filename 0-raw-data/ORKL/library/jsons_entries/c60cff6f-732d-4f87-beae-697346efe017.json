These new variants\nprove that ransomware’s [targeted and extortion-focused era is alive and well in 2021.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/ph/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/the-state-of-ransomware-2020-s-catch-22)\n\n## Technical analyses\n\n**AlumniLocker ransomware**\n\nWe recently spotted the AlumniLocker ransomware, a variant of the Thanos ransomware family, which asks for a ransom payment of 10\nbitcoins (equivalent to US$457,382.60 as of writing). The ransomware actors also threaten to publish their victims’ data on their “wall of\nshame” website if they don’t send the payment within 48 hours.\n\nAlumniLocker arrives via a malicious PDF email attachment. Based on our investigation, the PDF is a fake invoice that urges the victim\nto download it.\n\nFigure 1. A screenshot of the malicious PDF file\n\nThe malicious PDF contains a link (hxxps://femto[.]pw/cyp5) that, once clicked, will download a ZIP archive containing a downloader.\n\nFigure 2. Downloader content\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ZIP archive also contains a fake JPG file, which is actually a PowerShell script that will download and execute the AlumniLocker\n[payload by abusing a Background Intelligent Service Transfer (BITS) module.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/bitstransfer/?view=win10-ps)\n\nFigure 3. The fake JPG file that contains a\n\nPowerShell script that abuses a BITS module\n[The AlumniLocker ransomware file is a Themida-packed](https://www.oreans.com/ThemidaHelp.pdf) [Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) executable file. It appends .alumni to](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24290/intermediate-language-il-net)\nencrypted files:\n\nFigure 4. A screenshot of a victim’s encrypted files\n\nOnce AlumniLocker encrypts a victim’s files, a text file that details the amount of ransom demanded by the actors, as well as\ninstructions on how to send over the payment, is shown via Notepad. If the ransom amount is not paid within the specified period, the\nransomware actors threaten to publish the victim’s personal files on their website, which is inaccessible as of writing.\n\nFigure 5. The AlumniLocker\n\nransom note\n\n### Humble ransomware\n\nWe spotted the Humble ransomware in February 2021. This not-so-typical ransomware family is compiled with an executable wrapper\n(Bat2Exe). Our investigation points to two Humble ransomware variants, both with extortion techniques that prompt victims to pay\nransom expeditiously. One variant threatens a victim that once they restart their system, the Master Boot Record (MBR) will be\nrewritten. Meanwhile, the other variant makes the same threat about the MBR being rewritten if the victim does not pay the ransom\nwithin five days.\n\n[The main executable is the batch file itself — something that might be uncommon but not new. What sets this ransomware apart from](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/megacortex-ransomware-spotted-attacking-enterprise-networks)\nothers is its utilization of a public webhook service from communication platform Discord to report to its author or publish infection\nreports from its victims.\n\nThe Humble ransomware denies explorer.exe from viewing or accessing local storage drives.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. A screenshot of an infected machine showing that no other drives\n\nare accessible through explorer.exe except for removable drives\n\nFigure\n\n7. Humble ransomware prevents explorer.exe from accessing local storage drives.\nThe first Humble ransomware variant we analyzed drops the %temp%\\{temp directory}\\extd.exe component, which is usually used for\ncryptography and web API binary, to aid with file encryption.\n\nThe malware utilizes certutil.exe, a program that manages Windows certificates, to generate a key from a randomized input. This will\nthen be used by the extd.exe component to encrypt files.\n\nFigure 8. Humble ransomware uses CertUtil to generate a key from a randomized\n\ninput.\nHumble ransomware encrypts 104 file types, including files with the following extensions: .exe, .pdf, .mp3, .jpeg, .cc, .java, and .sys.\n\nAfter a machine is successfully encrypted, the malware sends a report to the ransomware operator’s Discord webhook panel via a\ncustom-made AutoIt-compiled Discord webhook binary.\n\nFigure 9. A report generated using a Discord webhook panel to inform the Humble ransomware operator of a new successful infection\nand encryption\nThe malware will generate a random string that will then be used to append the infected files. The malware also displays a ransom note\nthat is set as a user’s lock-screen image, warning the victim against restarting the system.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Humble ransomware’s ransom note\n\ndisplayed as a lock-screen image\nThe second Humble ransomware variant that we analyzed downloads the component file (detected by Trend Micro as\n[Boot.Win32.KILLMBR.AD) using PowerShell, certutil.exe, and extd.exe, instead of being encoded within and being automatically](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Boot.Win32.KILLMBR.AD/)\ndropped from the batch file.\n\nFigure 11. The\n\ncomponents of the more recent Humble ransomware variant\nThis variant informs the victim of the infected machine that if they do not pay the ransom of 0.0002 bitcoins (US$9.79 as of writing)\nwithin five days, all files will be deleted.\n\nFigure 12. The ransom note for the second\n\nvariant of Humble ransomware\n\n## Security recommendations and Trend Micro solutions\n\nAs ransomware families and variants evolve, they become more deliberate with their approaches and employ the use of complex\ntechniques and behaviors with the goal of successfully siphoning off millions in ransomware payments. According to the insurance\ncompany [Coalition, cyberextortion amounts doubled from 2019 to the first quarter of 2020.](https://info.coalitioninc.com/rs/566-KWJ-784/images/DLC-2020-09-Coalition-Cyber-Insurance-Claims-Report-2020.pdf)\n\nUsers and organizations should follow important security recommendations in order to keep their devices and systems protected from\nransomware, including enforcing the principle of least privilege, disabling local admin accounts, and limiting access to shared or network\ndrives.\n\nThe following are other vital recommendations for users and organizations to prevent ransomware attacks:\n\nUnverified emails and links embedded in them should be opened with caution, as ransomware has been known to spread in this\nmanner.\nImportant files should be backed up using the 3-2-1 rule: Create three backup copies on two different media with one backup in a\nseparate location.\nRegularly update software, programs, and applications to protect them from the latest vulnerabilities.\nKeep personal information safe as even this could give out clues to security information on used systems\n\n\n-----\n\n**How can Trend Micro protect organizations from ransomware?**\n\n[Trend Micro’s comprehensive XDR solution applies the most effective expert analytics to the deep data sets collected from Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response/managed-xdr-mdr.html)\nsolutions across the enterprise, making faster connections to identify and stop attacks.
