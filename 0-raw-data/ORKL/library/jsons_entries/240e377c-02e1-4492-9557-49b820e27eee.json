Defending against Pyongyang’s_\n_cyberattacks requires the same constant vigilance and rapidly evolving meth­_\n_ods and techniques that law enforcement agencies had to use in response to its_\n_evasion of sanctions. The United States has taken only limited actions against_\n_North Korean hackers and foreign countries that allow them to operate and_\n\n_launder money from cybercrimes. Without a firm response from the U.S., the_\n_North Korean regime will continue to undermine the effectiveness of inter­_\n\n_national sanctions and could inflict even greater damage during a crisis or_\n_military conflict._\n\n\nNorth Korean missiles and nuclear weapons have garnered fear, inter­\nnational condemnation, and tough sanctions. Pyongyang’s cyber activities,\nhowever, have elicited less reaction and punishment despite having been\nused repeatedly in attacks against governments, financial institutions,\nand industries.\n\nThe attitude of experts toward North Korea’s cyber capabilities\nwas initially dismissive, just as their reaction to the regime’s nuclear\nand missile programs had been.[1] Many, pointing to the famous night­\ntime satellite imagery of northeast Asia with a dark North Korea\nsurrounded by the blazing lights of its neighbors, did not believe that\nthe technologically backward regime was capable of sophisticated\ncyberattacks.\n\nNevertheless, although the regime fails to provide technological comforts\nfor its populace, Pyongyang developed an advanced cyber warfare prow­\ness that is surpassed by few nations. From initial rudimentary distributed\n\n\n-----\n\n**2** NORTH KOREAN CYBERATTACKS:\nA DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT\n\ndenial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against South Korea, the regime improved\nits cyber programs to create a robust and global array of disruptive military,\nfinancial, and espionage capabilities.\n\nAs its cyber proficiencies evolved, Pyongyang implemented ever more\nsophisticated techniques and prioritized financial targets to evade interna­\ntional sanctions and augment the regime’s coffers for its nuclear and missile\nprograms. Although it appears to have de-emphasized cyber operations\nagainst military and infrastructure targets in recent years, the regime previ­\nously alluded to attacking allied info-centric warfare strategies and civilian\nnetworks during a crisis.\n\nThe scope of North Korea’s demonstrated cyber capabilities and the\nseverity of other recent cyberattacks, such as the Russian-sponsored Solar­\nWinds hack, Chinese exploitation of Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities,\n\nand DarkSide malware shutting down of the Colonial Pipeline, demonstrate\nthe continued critical vulnerability of the government, financial, infrastruc­\nture, and corporate sectors. The United States, in conjunction with foreign\ngovernments and the private sector, needs to augment cyber defenses and\nrespond more forcefully to attacks. Failure to do so enables North Korea\nto continue undermining the effectiveness of international sanctions and\nleaves the United States and its partners exposed to a potentially devastat­\ning cyberattack in the future.\n\n\n###### Cyber: A Key Component of North Korean Strategy\n\nPyongyang has developed a comprehensive and sophisticated arsenal\nof cyberattack tools and methods. In 2017, senior U.S. intelligence officials\nassessed that North Korea was one of the top four cyber threats capable\nof launching “disruptive or destructive cyberattacks” against the United\nStates.[2] The Director of Central Intelligence warned in January 2019 that\nNorth Korea “poses a significant cyber threat to financial institutions,\nremains a cyber-espionage threat, and retains the ability to conduct dis­\nruptive cyber attacks.”[3]\n\nNorth Korea’s cyber weapons and tactics are consistent with the regime’s\nasymmetric military strategy. As North Korea’s conventional military forces\ndeteriorated in comparison with those of the United States and South Korea,\nPyongyang developed new weapons to counter the growing gap in capabili­\nties, including nuclear weapons, missiles, and long-range artillery.\n\nAfter studying U.S. military operations in Iraq, North Korean leader Kim\nJong-il concluded that allied high-tech warfare was vulnerable to cyber­\n\nattacks and that “in the 21st century, war will be [fought as] information\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPECIAL REPORT | No. 247** September 2, 2021 | 3\nheritage.org\n\nwarfare.”[4] Kim opined that “cyber attacks are like atomic bombs” and that\n“[w]ar is won and lost by who has greater access to the adversary’s military\n\n\ntechnical information in peacetime.”[5]\n\nNorth Korean strategists see cyberspace as an integral part of its military\nstrategy, designating it “the fifth major battlefield” along with ground, air,\nsea, and space.[6] By 2009, Kim declared that North Korea was “fully ready\nfor any form of high-tech war.”[7] The South Korean Ministry of Defense\nwarned that North Korea was able to disrupt Global Position System (GPS)\nnetworks and was developing the means to jam high-tech missiles and pre­\ncision-guided bombs.[8]\n\nKim Jong-il initiated North Korea’s foray into cyber warfare, but\nit was during Kim Jong-un’s reign that Pyongyang accelerated and\nexpanded its cyberattacks on a broader spectrum of targets. Since 2010,\nNorth Korea is believed to have jammed the GPS systems of planes\nover Incheon Airport; stopped the release of a major motion picture\nin the United States; hacked into South Korean banks, newspapers,\nand nuclear power plants; and defrauded banks and cybercurrency\nexchanges to gain billions of dollars.\n\n“With intensive information and communication technology, and\nthe brave Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) with its [cyber] war­\nriors,” Kim declared in 2013, “we can penetrate any sanctions for the\nconstruction of a strong and prosperous nation.”[9] It is noteworthy that\neven then, Kim highlighted the financial sanctions–evading aspect of\ncyber operations.\n\n\nKim Jong-un declared that cyber warfare is a “magic weapon”[10] and an\n“all-purpose sword that guarantees the North Korean People’s Armed Forces\n\nruthless striking capability, along with nuclear weapons and missiles.”[11] In\nthe run-up to a crisis or as an alternative to kinetic strikes, the regime could\nconduct cyberattacks on government and civilian computer networks that\ncontrol communications, finances, and infrastructure such as power plants\nand electrical grids.\n\n\n###### Cybercrime: New Methods for Old Strategy\n\nNorth Korea’s cyber operations are consistent not only with its asymmet­\nric military strategy, but also with the regime’s long history of using criminal\nactivities to acquire money. Earlier criminal efforts included counterfeiting\nof currencies, pharmaceutical drugs, and cigarettes; production and traf­\nficking of illicit drugs, including opium and methamphetamines; trafficking\nin endangered species products; and insurance fraud.\n\n\n-----\n\n**4** NORTH KOREAN CYBERATTACKS:\nA DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT\n\nCybercrimes enable the North Korean regime to gain currency and\nevade international sanctions in ways that are more efficient, cost-effec­\ntive, and lucrative than past illicit activities and more recent smuggling\nand ship-to-ship transfers of oil. The regime’s cybercrimes are global in\nscope, provide astronomical returns on investment, and are low-risk since\nthey are difficult to detect and attribute with little likelihood of inter­\nnational retribution. There have been very few United Nations (U.N.) or\nU.S. sanctions imposed or legal actions taken against North Korean cyber\n\ngroups. Cybercrime is especially beneficial to the regime as it faces the\ncumulative effects of international sanctions and the impact of self-im­\nposed COVID restrictions on legal and illicit foreign trade, as well as\nnatural disasters in the agricultural heartland and decades of devastating\nsocialist economic policies.\n\n**Cybercrime Eclipsing Traditional Crimes. As the international**\ncommunity cracked down on North Korea’s various criminal endeavors,\nthe beleaguered regime shifted toward new ways to gain money. Cyber\noperations are now a greater component of North Korean criminal activ­\nities than earlier, more traditional “bricks and mortar” endeavors such as\ncounterfeiting and smuggling. North Korea’s hackers “have become the\nworld’s leading bank robbers,” in the words of John Demers, head of the\nNational Security Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. “Simply put,\nthe regime has become a criminal syndicate with a flag, which harnesses its\nstate resources to steal hundreds of millions of dollars.”[12]\n\nAs with any criminal activity, it is difficult to assess how much North\nKorea has gained from its cybercrime operations. Governments, finan­\n\ncial institutions, and law enforcement agencies may be unaware of some\ncybercrimes or unable to determine the perpetrator conclusively. Even\nwith a successful cybercrime, North Korean hackers may not have been\nable to convert all of the cryptocurrency into hard cash, and some vic­\ntimized financial institutions were able to recover some or all of their\nlost currency.\n\nIn August 2019, the U.N. Panel of Experts estimated that North Korea\nhad cumulatively gained $2 billion from cybercrime.[13] For comparison, in\n2019, North Korea legally imported $2.7 billion in assorted civilian mer­\nchandise, mostly from China,[14] and its annual gross domestic product (GDP)\nwas $29 billion.[15]\n\nA South Korean organization has estimated that North Korean cyber­\ncrimes generate an annual revenue of $860 million,[16] but others assess that\nPyongyang may gain $1 billion a year—a third of the value of the nation’s\n\nexports—from cyber heists.[17] During 2017–2018, North Korea was estimated\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPECIAL REPORT | No. 247** September 2, 2021 | 5\nheritage.org\n\nto account for 65 percent of all global cybercrime.[18] One regime hacking\nunit, the Lazarus Group, is assessed to have gained more than $1.75 billion\nworth of cryptocurrency.[19]\n\nIn September 2018, a grand jury issued an indictment of North Korean\ncyber operative Park Jin-hyok for attempted cyber heists and extortions\nin Asia, Africa, North America, and South America totaling $1.3 billion\nduring 2015–2018.[20] In 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice declared that\nNorth Korean hacking of virtual currency exchanges and related money\nlaundering “poses a grave threat to the security and integrity of the global\nfinancial system.”[21]\n\n\n###### North Korean Cyber Agencies\n\nPyongyang has an expansive array of government organizations and\naffiliated hacker groups conducting malicious cyber operations.[22] Orga­\nnizations appear to have specified missions, although there also appear to\nbe overlap or changes in mission over time. The shadowy nature of covert\ncyber groups, as well as fragmentary and conflicting information, makes a\ndefinitive understanding difficult.\n\nThe predominant government organizations for cyber operations are the\nReconnaissance General Bureau and the General Staff Department. Both\n\nare subordinate to the State Affairs Commission,[23] which is chaired by Kim\nJong-un, and have numerous subordinate units. Other government units\n\n\ninclude the State Security Department and the Defense Commission.\n\nIn additional to government agencies, numerous affiliated North Korean\nhacker groups are conducting attacks against government, financial, infra­\nstructure, and other sectors. These groups include:\n\n\nl\nAndariel;\n\nl\nBeagleBoyz;\n\n\nl\nBluenoroff;\n\nl\nThe Chollima groups;\n\n\nl\nDark Hotel;\n\nl\nGroup 123;\n\n\n-----\n\n**6** NORTH KOREAN CYBERATTACKS:\nA DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT\n\nl\nThe Kimsuky group;\n\n\nl\nLazarus (also known as APT38);[24]\n\nl\nReaper (also known as APT37 and Thallium); and\n\n\nl\nStarcraft.\n\nThe U.S. government refers to the North Korean government’s malicious\ncyber activity collectively as Hidden Dragon.\n\n\n###### North Korea’s Illicit Cyber Operations\n\nCyber operations provide new methods and tools that Pyongyang can use\nto fulfill its long-standing objectives of espionage, disruptive and destruc­\ntive operations, extortion and terrorism, illicit money-making activities,\nand evasion of sanctions. North Korean hackers have penetrated computer\nnetworks to:\n\n\nl\nCollect intelligence on and steal secrets from defense, military tech­\nnology, intelligence, financial, nuclear, and pharmaceutical targets;\n\nl\nDisrupt, damage, and destroy computer systems through\n\n\nDDoS attacks;\n\n\nl\nDeploy ransomware to encrypt data or files to hold computer systems\n\nhostage until extortion payments or other demands were met, some­\ntimes in conjunction with violent physical attacks, as well as running\ncyber protection rackets whereby North Korean cyber groups will\nrefrain from attacking entities in return for payment;\n\n\nl\nRetaliate against opponents of the regime or those who demean North\n\nKorean leaders; and\n\n\nl\nIllegally acquire and launder stolen money to evade sanctions and\n\nraise funds for the cash-strapped regime by cyberattacking banks,\nfinancial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges, and the SWIFT\n(Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunica­\ntion) network.[25]\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPECIAL REPORT | No. 247** September 2, 2021 | 7\nheritage.org\n\n###### Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\n\n\nNorth Korean hackers are adept at developing sophisticated cyber coding\nto gain access even to well-protected government, military, and financial\ncomputer networks. They are also astute at exploiting human vulnerabil­\nities through social engineering methods to trick victims into uploading\nmalware that compromises network security.\n\nHackers seek access in much the same way that intelligence agencies\nrecruit human assets. Like intelligence agencies, they ascertain the informa­\ntion and organizations that would achieve government-directed objectives,\nconduct reconnaissance to identify individuals that could provide access to\nthat information, assess vulnerabilities and the means by which to exploit\nthem, and determine which methods they can use to exfiltrate the data.\n\nNorth Korea often delivers malware through spear-phishing emails tar­\ngeted at people who can provide either direct or tertiary access to a target\nnetwork. While many of these attempts are variants on “please click on\nthe (infected) attachment,” the means employed to allay the target’s suspi­\ncions have become increasingly clever. The hackers use “spoofing” tactics\nto disguise an email, social media account, or website so that it appears\nto be from a recognized reliable source so that the target will unwittingly\nupload malware. The approaches are often individually customized and\nhighly profiled, using personal information either about the target or about\nindividuals or organizations that the target would trust.\n\nIn Operations Dream Job, In(ter)ception, North Star, and WannaJob,\nNorth Korea targeted Australian, Indian, Israeli, Russian, South Korean,\n\nand U.S., defense and aerospace experts to gain classified or proprietary\ninformation by using fake job offers from defense contractors as lures to\ninstall data-gathering implants on the victims’ systems. The cyber groups\nimpersonated job recruiters by creating fictitious WhatsApp, Facebook, and\nLinkedIn profiles of legitimate companies and even conducted extensive\n\ndialogue through email and phone calls.\n\n\nSimilar techniques were used against employees of banks, companies,\nand other organizations to gain access to computer networks.[26] North\nKorean groups will mimic colleagues, friends, journalists, or Korea-related\n\norganizations to gain access to a victim’s computer and then use acquired\ninformation or contact lists to conduct follow-on approaches.[27] The groups\nhave even commissioned experts to write papers that were then used as bait\nwhen targeting other experts.[28]\n\nHackers and intelligence agencies also welcome targets that offer them­\nselves as sources. A “walk-in” intelligence source walks into an embassy or\n\n\n-----\n\n**8** NORTH KOREAN CYBERATTACKS:\nA DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT\n\notherwise contacts a government source to volunteer his or her services\nwithout having been previously targeted. Hackers conduct “watering hole”\nattacks by either infecting or creating websites that potential sources are\nlikely to visit.\n\nThe hackers can create infected documents or links and wait for someone\nto arrive and unknowingly take the bait. In 2017, North Korean hackers\ninfected the website of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority with\nmalware that was programmed to download to computers that visited the\nsite only if they were from 104 preselected financial institutions and tele­\ncommunications companies.[29]\n\nOnce a source has provided access, the available information, including\ninformation on possible access to other potential targets, is investigated\nand vetted for its usefulness. North Korean hackers may spend nine to\n18 months conducting reconnaissance, elevating user privileges, and\n\ndisabling security procedures before attempting to execute a cybertheft.\nNorth Korean hackers are seen as unique in their willingness to destroy\nlarge amounts of data to cover their tracks or distract targets while a theft\nis in process.[30]\n\n\n###### North Korea’s Evolving Cyber Operations\n\nPyongyang’s cyberattacks developed through several phases.[31] Initially,\nthe regime focused on cyber espionage to steal information and cyberat­\ntacks to disrupt or destabilize networks related to national defense, nuclear\npower plants, infrastructure, telecommunications, media, and corporations.\nEarly cyber operations were a form of “reconnaissance by fire” to test pre­\nliminary capabilities against opponents’ defenses and may have served as\nproof of concept for far more extensive and crippling operations to be used\nin a time of military conflict or major crisis.\n\nAs North Korea improved the scope, scale, and sophistication of its\ncyber operations, it progressed through phases of cyberterrorism, revenge\nattacks, and extortion; cyber bank robbery; cryptocurrency exchanges and\ndecentralized finance (DeFi) platforms; and (after the onset of COVID)\npharmaceutical companies. The initiation of a new phase did not curtail\ncyberattacks prevalent in previous phases, although their scope and pri­\noritization might have changed. For example, cyberespionage operations\ncontinued after Pyongyang initiated cybercriminal activities to gen­\nerate revenue.\n\nIn 2015, North Korea began cyber robbery operations to gain revenue for\nthe beleaguered, heavily sanctioned regime. Pyongyang began with attacks\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPECIAL REPORT | No. 247** September 2, 2021 | 9\nheritage.org\n\nagainst traditional financial institutions such as banks, fraudulent forced\ninterbank transfers, and automated teller machine (ATM) thefts. After the\ninternational community took notice of these attacks, the regime shifted\nto targeting cryptocurrency exchanges. By 2020, according to one U.N.\nmember state, North Korean “attacks against virtual currency exchange\nhouses [had] produced more illicit proceeds than attacks against financial\ninstitutions” with stronger cyber protections.[32]\n\n\n###### Potential North Korean Cyber Actions During a Crisis\n\nNorth Korea has proven to be adept at deeply penetrating even highly\nsecure computer networks of governments, militaries, banks and interna­\ntional financial transaction systems, and critical infrastructure targets. More\nworrisome, however, is the possibility that Pyongyang could inflict even greater\ndamage during a crisis or hostilities on the Korean Peninsula. These attacks\nindicate that Pyongyang has the potential to engage in cyber warfare with\ndisproportionately massive impact—in other words, to create a cyber 9/11.\n\nNorth Korea could paralyze critical infrastructure systems such as com­\nmunications, dams, electrical grids, hospitals, nuclear power plants, supply\nchains, and traffic-control systems. North Korean hackers have targeted\nrailroad companies and airlines, including an automated operating system\nthat controls trains’ speed. Hackers have already jammed airline GPS sig­\nnals and might seek to gain control of airplane controls.[33]\n\nIn 2013, South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) revealed that\nPyongyang had developed a Trojan program to take over computer networks\n\nand power supply systems, chemical materials facilities, oil storage termi­\nnals, water treatment stations, and subway networks throughout South\nKorea. The NIS indicated that the regime had recorded the geographic\n\ncoordinates of South Korean chemical materials facilities, oil storage ter­\nminals, water treatment stations, and power plants and that it had collected\ninformation on power substations, subway networks and elevated roadways\nin major cities, tunnels, bridges, and railroad stations.[34]\n\nIn 2017, North Korea attempted to use spear-phishing emails to gain\nentry into U.S. electric companies as an early-stage reconnaissance oper­\nation. Computer security firm FireEye reported that the hackers failed to\ngain access at that time to computer systems or industrial control systems\nthat regulate the supply of power.[35] Nevertheless, the U.S. government\nhas warned that North Korea’s illicit cyber activities “threaten the United\nStates and the broader international community and, in particular, pose a\nsignificant threat to the integrity and stability of the international financial\n\n\n-----\n\n**10** NORTH KOREAN CYBERATTACKS:\nA DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT\n\nsystem,” in addition to which “[t]he DPRK has the capability to conduct dis­\nruptive or destructive cyber activities affecting U.S. critical infrastructure.”[36]\n\nPyongyang could engage in economic warfare to steal massive amounts\nof money or undermine the stability of the international financial system\nor worldwide markets. The regime could conduct ransomware attacks on\nbanks to gain money or to disable or destroy computer networks as well as\nflood the SWIFT system with fraudulent transactions. In 2019, more than\n11,000 SWIFT member institutions worldwide sent approximately 33.6\n\n\nmillion transactions per day through the network.[37]\n\n###### What the United States Should Do\n\n\nNorth Korean cyber operations are a strategic threat to the United States,\nits partners, and the international financial network. Pyongyang’s cyber­\ncrimes provide a means to evade sanctions and undermine international\nefforts to curtail the regime’s prohibited nuclear and missile programs.\n\nWashington needs to make addressing this threat a national priority by\nestablishing a comprehensive whole-of-government strategy, to be coordi­\nnated with other governments as well as the private sector. The U.S. should\nfully enforce existing laws and assess whether additional legislative and\nexecutive actions are needed, including enhanced regulations of cyber­\ncurrency exchanges and DeFis. Washington should determine a range of\npunitive steps, both cyber and kinetic, for responding to attacks deemed\ndetrimental to national security.\n\nSpecifically, Washington should:\n\n\nl\n**Assess the threat. The Director of National Intelligence should**\n\nprepare classified and unclassified National Intelligence Estimates\ndefining the extent of North Korean cyber capabilities, past attacks,\nand the potentially greater threat from future operations, including\nduring a crisis or hostilities on the Korean Peninsula. These reports\nshould be submitted to appropriate committees in Congress.\n\n\nThe U.S. should also continue to issue threat advisories that provide\n\ndetailed technical details of North Korean cyber organizations, recent\ncyberattacks, ways to evade cyber defenses, and money laundering\nin order to alert government and private-sector entities to take\nappropriate actions to improve cyber defenses. Widespread public\ndissemination of threat information and private contacts with other\ngovernments as well as banks, financial institutions, and companies\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPECIAL REPORT | No. 247** September 2, 2021 | 11\nheritage.org\n\nenable the sharing of more detailed information while still protecting\nclassified sources and methods.\n\n\nl\n**Create a comprehensive national strategy to combat cyber**\n**threats. Addressing North Korea’s cyber threat should be a national**\npriority that requires a comprehensive whole-of-government\nresponse that uses all of the instruments of national power. Given the\nexpansive nature of Pyongyang’s cyber operations, the effort should\nbe directed by the White House and should include, at a minimum, the\nDepartments of Treasury, Justice, Defense, Commerce, and Homeland\n\nSecurity as well as the Intelligence Community.\n\n\nIt is encouraging that the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act\n\ncreated the position of National Cyber Director to serve as principal\nadviser to the President on cyber policy. Chris Inglis, a 28-year veteran\nof the National Security Agency, was confirmed in June 2021 to lead\ncoordination of U.S. cybersecurity policy and strategy implementa­\ntion; oversee efforts to increase cybersecurity and deter malicious\ncyber activity; coordinate the federal response to cyberattacks; engage\nwith the private sector; engage in diplomatic efforts to develop norms\nof and international consensus on responsible state cyber behavior;\nand support “the integration of defensive cyber plans and capabilities\nwith offensive cyber plans.”[38] Also encouraging was President Biden’s\nannouncement that he would “make cybersecurity a top priority at\nevery level of government…further strengthen partnerships with the\nprivate sector, and expand our investment in the infrastructure and\npeople we need to defend against malicious cyberattacks.”[39]\n\n\nHowever, questions remain with respect to how the National Cyber\nDirector will interact with other senior officials and organizations\nwith direct or indirect cyber responsibilities. Who will have the clout\nto direct a coherent, comprehensive policy across vast bureaucratic\norganizations with overlapping responsibilities and conflicting prior­\nities? Without real authority over departments and agencies, the new\ncyber director could face some of the same problems that plagued the\nDirector of National Intelligence, whose position was created after the\n9/11 attack. If bureaucratic turf battles and inertia are to be overcome,\nthe President will have to make clear who has real authority on cyber\npolicy, particularly as it interacts with national security, economic,\nand law enforcement policies.\n\n\n-----\n\n**12** NORTH KOREAN CYBERATTACKS:\nA DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT\n\nl\n**Coordinate with the private sector. Extensive sharing of cyber-**\nthreat information among and between the public and private sectors\nis critical for improving defenses against North Korean and other\nhackers. Collaboration and coordination enable a more comprehen­\nsive assessment of weaknesses in government, industry, business,\nfinancial, and infrastructure computer networks as well as proposals\nfor innovative technical or methodological fixes. In conjunction with\nindustry, businesses, and financial institutions, Washington should\ntherefore develop, coordinate, and promulgate cyber rules, regulations,\nsecurity protocols, and best practices to improve cybersecurity and\nthe resilience of networks.\n\n\nThe Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act[40] authorized the Depart­\n\nment of Homeland Security to “encourage robust sharing of useful\ncybersecurity information among all types of entities—private,\nFederal, state, local, territorial, and tribal.”[41] The new Office of the\nNational Cyber Director will join existing government bodies in\nengaging with the private sector, and this will increase the potential\nfor competition, confusion, and industry frustration.[42] Care should be\ntaken to delineate responsibilities among government agencies.\n\n\nDespite all actions that governments, industries, and banks implement,\nthe weak link will still be the individual employee who inadvertently\nallows malware to penetrate the system. No matter how strong the cas­\ntle’s defenses are, one person carelessly allowing the drawbridge to drop\ndown undermines all defenses. With that in mind, organizations should\nexplore technical measures that preclude or reduce the downloading\nof malware. Preventing North Korean cyber intrusions will require\nboth improved technical defenses and effective measures to thwart the\nregime’s sophisticated social engineering techniques that induce indi­\nviduals to upload malware unknowingly into computer systems.\n\nl\n**Engage international partners. U.S. defenses are only as strong as**\nthe weakest link overseas. The U.S. should continue and expand efforts\nto coordinate with foreign governments, law enforcement agencies,\nand financial regulatory agencies at the national level and, through\nthem, regional and domestic partners. There should also be engage­\nment with foreign financial institutions and businesses to disseminate\ninformation on North Korean cyber hacking and money-laundering\ntactics, techniques, and procedures.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPECIAL REPORT | No. 247** September 2, 2021 | 13\nheritage.org\n\nThe United States should take the lead in multiple fora to establish and\n\nensure compliance with international cybersecurity standards. Such\nefforts could take place in existing diplomatic entities, such as the\nUnited Nations or G20 forum, led by the White House or State Depart­\nment, as well as with financial and law enforcement organizations.\n\n\n1. The U.N. Panel of Experts recommended that financial institutions,\n\nincluding banks and cryptocurrency exchanges, enhance cyber\ndefenses by sharing threat information and best practices through\norganizations such as the Financial Services Information Sharing\nand Analysis Center.[43] The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign\nAssets Control (OFAC) could take the lead on encouraging and\n\n\nfacilitating information sharing among law enforcement and finan­\ncial institutions. The initiative could be modeled on the Treasury\nDepartment’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN\nExchange program to enhance the sharing of information on prior­\nity illicit finance threats with financial institutions.[44]\n\n\n2. Washington should ensure that financial entities either fully comply\n\nwith existing regulations or risk losing their access to the SWIFT\nfinancial transaction network or ability to maintain correspondent\naccounts in the U.S. financial system.\n\n\n3. Given the United States’ extensive intelligence collection capabil­\n\n\nities and law enforcement expertise, Washington should dispatch\nteams overseas to engage with foreign government, law enforce­\nment, financial institutions, and private-sector entities to provide\ntargeted information on North Korean cyber programs. The U.S.\ndid this extensively to counter North Korean evasion of sanctions.\nThose efforts successfully alerted entities that were unaware of\nNorth Korean activities and triggered compliance prior to the\nissuing of formal U.S. punitive measures.\n\nl\n**Fully enforce laws against illicit activities and cyber opera­**\n**tions. Despite the severity of Pyongyang’s cyberattacks, the U.S.**\ngovernment has taken action only against a handful of North Korean\nactors. Unfortunately, this is consistent with actions by successive\nU.S. Administrations to limit law enforcement efforts against North\nKorean, Chinese, and other entities that violate U.S. laws and U.N.\nresolutions. The U.S. government should take action against North\n\n\n-----\n\n**14** NORTH KOREAN CYBERATTACKS:\nA DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT\n\nKorean hackers as well as countries that enable them to operate from\ntheir soil or that provide technology, equipment, or training.[45] This\ncan be done by:\n\n\n1. Fully resourcing the sanctions enforcement effort by dedicating\n\nsufficient investigative and enforcement effort to it;\n\n\n2. Fully enforcing FinCEN regulations that are applicable to crypto­\n\ncurrency transactions by U.S. nationals or within the United States;\n\n\n3. Prohibiting transactions by U.S. nationals or within the U.S. that\n\ninvolve cryptocurrencies the anonymity of which has facilitated\nillicit transactions on behalf of North Korea;\n\n\n4. Amending the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act\n\nof 2016[46] to ban transactions in proceeds derived from cryptocur­\nrency that constitute the proceeds of illicit activity or were involved\nin carrying out illicit activity; and\n\n\n5. Putting greater pressure on host nations to expel or extradite North\n\nKorean hackers, including terminating the U.S. Department of\nCommerce technology export licenses of nations that fail to do so.[47]\n\n\nStronger action could constrain North Korea’s ability to gain funding\nfor its prohibited nuclear and missile programs. The Departments\nof Treasury and Justice should target banks, financial institutions,\nand front companies that are used to launder money stolen by\nNorth Korea. In 2017, the U.S. Congress passed to the Trump White\nHouse a list of 12 Chinese banks that were believed to be committing\nmoney-laundering crimes in the U.S. financial system. To date, the\nexecutive branch has taken no action. In the past, the U.S. imposed $8\nbillion–$9 billion in fines on European banks that laundered money\nfor Iran, but it has yet to impose any fines on Chinese banks that\nlaunder money for North Korea.\n\nJustice Department actions against some North Koreans revealed the\n\n\nextent to which they had moved money illicitly through nine different\nChinese banks. The Treasury Department should engage with those\nbanks to discern whether they unwittingly facilitated financial crimes,\nin which case they should be subject to remedial actions, or were\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPECIAL REPORT | No. 247** September 2, 2021 | 15\nheritage.org\n\ncomplicit, in which case they should be fined, labelled money-laun­\ndering concerns, and denied access to the U.S. financial system.[48] The\nBank Secrecy Act, Section 312 of the USA Patriot Act, and other U.S.\nregulations require U.S. financial institutions to take anti–money\nlaundering measures to ensure that correspondent bank accounts of\nforeign entities are not used for money-laundering purposes in U.S.\nfinancial institutions.[49]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Congress enacted the National Defense Authoriza­\ntion Act for fiscal 2021,[50] which includes the Anti-Money Laundering\nAct of 2020. The statute updates U.S. anti-money laundering laws,\n\nsignificantly expands the U.S. government’s authority to subpoena\ndocuments held by foreign banks overseas, and codifies a $50,000 daily\nfine for failing to comply with subpoenas. The act also preserves the\ngovernment’s ability to terminate foreign correspondent accounts\nin the U.S. financial system, which is a financial “death penalty” for\nforeign banks that do not comply.[51]\n\n\nl\n**Augment regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges. As banks**\n\nand financial institutions responded to North Korean cyberattacks,\nPyongyang shifted toward cryptocurrency exchanges and DeFis both\n\nas targets and as means to launder money. The U.S., in conjunction\nwith other nations, should review existing legislation and regulations\nthat are applicable to cryptocurrency exchanges to ensure sufficient\nsecurity against cyberattacks and prevent money-laundering.\n\n\nThe U.N. Panel of Experts recommended that member states should\n\n\nimplement Financial Action Task Force standards and “that to\nmanage and mitigate the risks emerging from virtual assets,” such\nassets should be subject to enhanced monitoring and compliance\nstandards.[52] The United States could augment its technical warning\nnotices to include increased emphasis on identifying North Korean\nattacks, specific actors and their virtual coin “wallets,” and techniques\nused against cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nl\n**Determine U.S. responses to North Korean cyberattacks. The**\npotential for greater and even catastrophic North Korean cyberattacks\nagainst the United States, its partners, and the international financial\nsystem raises questions about the proper levels of retaliatory or even\npreemptive actions against the regime. “[A] good defense isn’t enough,”\n\n\n-----\n\n**16** NORTH KOREAN CYBERATTACKS:\nA DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT\n\nPresident Biden has commented; “we need to disrupt and deter our\n\nadversaries from undertaking significant cyberattacks in the first\nplace. We will do that by, among other things, imposing substantial\ncosts on those responsible for such malicious attacks, including in\ncoordination with our allies and partners.”[53]\n\n\nGiven North Korea’s limited exposure to cyberattacks, a U.S. or\ninternational response would also need to consider non-cyber tools\nof national power. These include “diplomatic action, cooperation\nreduction, visa restriction, financial sanctions, legal action, and\nmilitary action. A consistent pattern of imposing meaningful costs\nfor malicious cyber behavior will strengthen our cyber deterrence\nif applied consistently, and in some cases, publicly.”[54] A military\nresponse to a non-military cyberattack would be a difficult decision,\nparticularly given the difficulty of conclusively assigning blame for\ncyber operations. In 2014, however, NATO leaders agreed that a largescale cyberattack on a member country would be considered an attack\non the entire alliance, potentially leading to the invocation of Article\n5 and triggering a military response.[55] Similarly, the United States\nand Japan agreed in 2019 that in certain circumstances, a cyberattack\ncould constitute an armed attack for the purposes of Article V of the\nU.S.–Japan Security Treaty.[56]\n\n\nThe United States should consider discussing with other U.N. member\n\nnations whether future North Korean cyberattacks should merit a\nU.N. Security Council resolution and accompanying sanctions, such as\nthose imposed in response to the regime’s nuclear and missile tests.[57]\nNorth Korean cyber groups that commit cybercrimes to evade sanc­\ntions and gain funding for the regime’s prohibited nuclear and missile\nprograms could be sanctioned under existing resolutions.\n\n###### Conclusion\n\n\nNorth Korea is a direct threat to the security of the United States, its\nallies, and the international financial system. Pyongyang continues to aug­\nment and refine its nuclear, missile, and cyber threats to the United States\nand its allies. While its kinetic military attacks have been limited in recent\nyears, the regime has freely engaged in an expansive cyber gray-zone war\nwith much lower risk of retaliation than conventional military actions entail.\nPyongyang has conducted cyber guerrilla warfare to steal classified military\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPECIAL REPORT | No. 247** September 2, 2021 | 17\nheritage.org\n\nsecrets, has absconded with billions of dollars in money and cybercurrency,\nhas held computer systems hostage, and has inflicted extensive damage on\ncomputer networks.\n\nDefending against North Korean cyberattacks requires constant vig­\nilance and rapidly evolving methods and techniques of the sort that law\nenforcement agencies had to use in response to Pyongyang’s improved\ntactics for evading sanctions. Complacency or a lack of vigor will leave\ncritical government, military, financial, and industry sectors vulnerable to\npotentially devastating attacks.\n\nYet the United States has taken only limited actions against North Korean\nhackers and foreign countries that allow them to operate and launder money\nfrom cybercrimes. Without a firm response from the U.S. to North Korea’s\nhack of Sony and subsequent threat of terrorism, such attacks against the\nU.S. and its interests will only grow more common.\n\n\n-----\n\n**18** NORTH KOREAN CYBERATTACKS:\nA DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT\n\n###### Appendix 1: North Korean Government Agencies and Subordinate Groups Conducting Cyber Operations\n\n\n###### Government Agencies\n\nl\n**Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).

A bank official noticed\n\n\na typographical error and prevented an additional $851 million from\nbeing stolen.[133] The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank authorized five of 35\nfraudulent payments.[134]\n\nl\n$9 million was stolen from Ecuador’s Banco del Austro.[135]\n\n\nl\n$18 million was stolen from the Standard Bank of South Africa. The\n\nJapanese government stated that the hackers used forged cards with\n\n\ncustomer information stolen from the Standard Bank of South Africa\nto withdraw cash from approximately 1,700 ATMs in Tokyo and 16\nprefectures across Japan.[136]\n\n\nl\nUnion Bank of India thwarted a theft of $166 million. Hackers trans­\n\nferred money to banks in Cambodia, Thailand, Taiwan, and Australia,\nbut authorities were able to recover the money.[137]\n\n\n-----\n\n**30** NORTH KOREAN CYBERATTACKS:\nA DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT\n\nl\nThere was an attempt to steal approximately $104.1 million from\n\n\nan unidentified African bank to bank accounts in Taiwan, Thailand,\nand Cambodia.[138]\n\nl\nThe South Korean online shopping mall Interpark was the target of a\n\n\nhack attack and blackmail of customer information. The National Police\nAgency reported that the hackers forced the transfer of $2.7 million.[139]\n\n2017\n\n\nl\n**FASTCash Campaign. North Korean hacker groups stole tens of**\nmillions of dollars from bank ATMs in Africa and Asia. An attack in\n2017 enabled cash withdrawals from ATMs in more than 30 countries,\n\nand a similar event in 2018 targeted banks in 23 countries.[140] In 2018,\nthe Cosmos Bank in India was targeted, enabling $13.5 million to be\nwithdrawn in more than 14,000 simultaneous ATM withdrawals by\n“money mules” with cloned ATM cards in 28 countries as well as in\n\n\nadditional transfers to an account belonging to a Hong Kong–based\ncompany using SWIFT transfers.[141]\n\nl\nAn attempt was made to steal $60 million from a Tunisian bank.[142]\n\n\nl\nAn attempt was made to steal approximately $60.1 million from the\n\nFar Eastern International Bank of Taiwan and transfer the money to\n\n\nbank accounts in Sri Lanka, Cambodia, and the United States.

Attacks in\n\nFebruary and July 2017 netted $7 million or more each, and subse­\n\n\nquent attacks in June 2018 and March 2019 netted $31 million and $20\nmillion, respectively.[156]\n\n\nl\nYoubit (South Korea) suffered multiple attacks involving a $4.8 million\n\nloss in April 2017 and then 17 per cent of its overall assets in December\n2017, forcing the exchange to file for bankruptcy.[157]\n\n\nl\nMonero (South Korea) lost $25,000 from cryptojacking.[158]\n\nl\nCoinis (South Korea) lost $2.19 million.[159]\n\n\n-----\n\n**32** NORTH KOREAN CYBERATTACKS:\nA DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT\n\nl\nNiceHash (Slovenia) lost more than $70 million.[160]\n\n\nl\nSouth Korean Cryptocurrency Company refused to pay a ransom\nof $16 million in cryptocurrency, so North Korean hackers released\nconfidential customer information.[161]\n\nl\nNorth Korean hackers extorted approximately $2.3 million in crypto­\n\n\ncurrency from Central American Online Casino 1 and approximately\n$361,500 in cryptocurrency from Central American Online Casino 2 to\nprevent the release of confidential customer information.[162]\n\n2018\n\n\nl\nIn Operation AppleJeus, North Korean hackers created a fake\n\ncryptocurrency company to deliver malware by means of a disguised\nregular application update to targets in China, the U.K., Poland, and\nRussia. The virus enabled the attacker to gain full control of the users’\n\n\ndevice and steal cryptocurrency.[163]\n\nl\nThe theft of USD$13 million was reported in India.[164]\n\n\nl\nIn Bangladesh, an attempt was made to steal $2.6 million.[165]\n\nl\nIn Japan, Coincheck declared that $532 million was stolen.[166]\n\n\nl\nNorth Korean groups hacked into an unidentified digital currency\n\nexchange and stole nearly $250 million worth of digital currency. Two\nChinese nationals who laundered the assets on behalf of the North\nKorean group received approximately $91 million (in addition to $9.5\nmillion from a hack of another exchange).[167]\n\n\nl\nThe Indonesian Cryptocurrency Company was victimized\n\nby the fraudulent transfers of approximately $24.9 million in\ncryptocurrency.[168]\n\n\n2019\n\nl\nDragonex (Thailand, Singapore, and Hong Kong) reported the theft of\n\n\n$7 million.[169]\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPECIAL REPORT | No. 247** September 2, 2021 | 33\nheritage.org\n\nl\nUpBit (South Korea) lost $49 million.[170]\n\n\n2020\n\nl\nThe Lazarus Group stole $275 million from the KuCoin currency\n\n\nexchange. KuCoin’s CEO stated that the exchange recovered $204\nmillion worth of the stolen funds.[171]\n\n\nl\nNew York Financial Services Company lost approximately $11.8\n\nmillion through fraudulent transfers of cryptocurrency.[172]\n\n\n###### Phase Five: Alternative Currencies and DeFis\n\nAfter successfully hacking into a financial target, operatives must even­\ntually convert cryptocurrency into real currency and launder it to avoid\ndetection. Cybersecurity experts have identified North Korean hackers\nmoving money through hundreds or thousands of separate transactions\nin numerous countries to launder it before cashing out.\n\nIn 2019, North Korea began to use decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms\nand decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEX) to launder cryptocur­\nrency. The Lazarus group’s use of DeFi platforms nearly doubled in 2020\nas its use of mainstream cryptocurrency exchanges decreased.[173] The\nshift reflects North Korea’s money-laundering adaptability in response\nto increasing security protocols or law enforcement focus on existing\nplatforms. CipherTrace, a crypto intelligence company, assessed that\ncryptocurrency thefts and hacks declined in 2020 due to increased security\nprocedures but that hacks against DeFis increased.[174]\n\n\n###### Phase Six: Pharmaceutical Companies\n\nNorth Korea took advantage of the COVID-19 crisis to target pharma­\nceutical companies for proprietary information on vaccine production as\nwell as individuals and businesses seeking COVID relief funding.\n\nIn 2020, the Lazarus group planned a large-scale phishing campaign\nagainst more than 5 million individuals and businesses in India, Japan,\nSingapore, South Korea, the U.K., and the United States. The hackers would\npose as local authorities dispersing government COVID support funds and\ndirect the targets to fake websites where they would divulge personal and\nfinancial information.[175]\n\n\n-----\n\n**34** NORTH KOREAN CYBERATTACKS:\nA DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT\n\nNorth Korean hackers targeted at least six pharmaceutical companies in\nthe U.S., the U.K. and South Korea that were working on COVID treatments,\nincluding Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, AstraZeneca, Genexine, Shin\nPoong, and Celltrion. It was unclear whether North Korea was attempting\nto create its own vaccine or to sell obtained vaccine information to a foreign\npharmaceutical company.[176] In some cases, the hackers sent spear-phishing\nemails representing themselves as job recruiters or World Health Organi­\nzation representatives.[177]\n\nThe Lazarus group also targeted government agencies conducting\nCOVID research, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices and the European Medicines Agency. The Kaspersky computer\nsecurity company assessed that some computers at government agencies\nand companies had been breached.[178]\n\nIn 2021, a member of the South Korean National Assembly asserted that\nintelligence reporting indicated that North Korea had targeted Pfizer to\ngain COVID vaccine information. It was uncertain whether the attack was\nsuccessful.[179]\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPECIAL REPORT | No. 247** September 2, 2021 | 35\nheritage.org\n\n###### Appendix 3: U.S. Government Responses to the North Korean Cyber Threat\n\n\nIn recent years, the U.S. government has issued numerous warning\nnotices to highlight the growing danger of North Korean cyberattacks.[180]\nThe notices provide detailed technical information to enable companies\n\nand financial institutions to develop defensive responses. Washington also\nhas issued indictments and imposed sanctions on North Korean individuals\nand entities in response to illicit cyber activities. Specifically:\n\nl\nIn 2014, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the\n\n\nReconnaissance Guidance Bureau after the Sony hack.\n\n\nl\nIn 2016, the United States designated North Korea as a money-laun­\n\ndering concern, precluding it from accessing the U.S. financial system\nfor international financial transactions.[181]\n\n\nl\nIn September 2018, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign\n\nAssets Control (OFAC) and the Department of Justice sanctioned and\n\n\nunsealed criminal charges against Park Jin-hyok and the Chosun Expo\nJoint Venture for their involvement in the Sony hack, Bangladesh bank\n\nrobbery, and WannaCry ransomware attack.[182]\n\n\nl\nIn June 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\n\naffirmed the U.S. government’s authority under the Patriot Act to\nsubpoena records from foreign banks with correspondent accounts\nin the United States as well as to cut off access by foreign banks to the\nU.S. financial system or dollar-denominated transactions.[183] The ruling\nwas in response to a Chinese company’s use of three Chinese banks to\nlaunder millions of dollars on behalf of North Korea’s sanctioned For­\neign Trade Bank. The court ruling “caused a ripple effect throughout\nthe Chinese financial sector. Stock prices for the three banks…plum­\nmeted shortly after the publication of the circuit court’s opinion.”[184]\n\n\nl\nIn September 2019, OFAC announced sanctions against the Lazarus,\n\nAndariel, and Bluenoroff hacking groups for cyberattacks to support\nNorth Korea’s illicit nuclear and missile programs. The legal action\nblocks any property or interests of these entities in the United States. Any\ntransactions by U.S. persons or foreign financial institutions using corre­\nspondent accounts in the United States would be subject to sanctions.[185]\n\n\n-----\n\n**36** NORTH KOREAN CYBERATTACKS:\nA DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT\n\nl\nIn February 2020, the Pentagon, the FBI, and the Department of\n\n\nHomeland Security issued a series of messages warning of a North\nKorean cyber-espionage hacking campaign to “conduct illegal activity,\n\nsteal funds & evade sanctions.”[186]\n\n\nl\nIn March 2020, a grand jury indicted and the Treasury Department\n\nimposed sanctions on two Chinese nationals (Tian Yinyin and Li\nJiadong) for laundering more than $100 million in cryptocurrency\n\n\nstolen by North Korean agents in a 2018 hack of a cyberexchange\nthat netted $250 million. The individuals were also linked to a North\nKorean cybertheft of $48.5 million from a South Korean currency\n\nexchange in 2019.[187]\n\n\nl\nIn May 2020, the Justice Department charged 28 North Korean and\n\nfive Chinese individuals with laundering more than $2.5 billion in\nillegal payments for Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and missile pro­\ngrams. The unsealed indictment accused the individuals of acting as\nagents of North Korea’s Foreign Trade Bank, the regime’s primary\nforeign currency bank and under U.S. sanctions for facilitating nuclear\nproliferation.[188] The case was the largest U.S. sanctions violations case\nagainst North Korea and reveals the extent to which the United States\nbelieves China has assisted North Korea’s illicit network to evade\ninternational sanctions.[189]\n\n\nl\nIn August 2020, the U.S. government warned of a North Korean group\n\ntargeting government defense contractors to gather intelligence\nsurrounding key military and energy technologies. The group used\nfake job postings from leading defense contractors as lures to install a\ndata-gathering implant on the victim's system.[190]\n\n\nl\nIn August 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil complaint\n\nfor forfeiture of 280 cryptocurrency accounts linked to North Korean\nhacking of two cryptocurrency exchanges in July 2019 and September\n2019 that netted millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency for the\nregime. “The complaint follows related criminal and civil actions\nannounced in March 2020 pertaining to the theft of $250 million\nin cryptocurrency through other exchange hacks by North Korean\nactors” and “exposes the ongoing connections between North Korea’s\ncyber-hacking program and a Chinese cryptocurrency money launder­\ning network.”[191]\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPECIAL REPORT | No. 247** September 2, 2021 | 37\nheritage.org\n\nl\nIn August 2020, the U.S. government issued a warning about the\n\n\ncompromise of ATMs by the North Korean–linked BeagleBoyz and\nOperation FastCash. In February 2020, North Korea had resumed its\ntargeting of banks in multiple countries for fraudulent international\nmoney transfers and ATM cashouts, ending “a lull in bank targeting\nsince late 2019.” BeagleBoyz overlaps with other North Korean cyber\ngroups and has been involved in attempts to steal nearly $2 billion at\nleast since 2015.[192]\n\n\nl\nIn September 2020, leaked U.S. government documents revealed that\n\nNorth Korea laundered $174.8 million in illicit funds from 2008 to\n2017 through prominent U.S. banks in New York, including JP Morgan\nChase and Bank of New York Mellon. The documents also showed that\nChinese companies were involved.[193]\n\n\nl\nIn October 2020, the U.S. government issued a warning alert on North\n\nKorean cyber group Kimsuky. The U.S. said the group was “engaged\nin ongoing cyber operations against worldwide targets to gain intel­\nligence for North Korea, specifically on foreign policy and national\nsecurity issues related to the Korean peninsula, nuclear policy, and\nsanctions.”[194] The group specifically targets experts, think tanks, and\ngovernment agencies in South Korea, Japan, and the United States.\n\n\nl\nIn February 2021, the U.S. government issued an alert about the\n\nLazarus group’s targeting of individuals and companies, including\n\n\ncryptocurrency exchanges and financial service companies, with\nmalware to steal cryptocurrency. Lazarus targeted cryptocurrency\norganizations in more than 30 countries during 2020 using crypto­\ncurrency malware, referred to as AppleJeus. North Korea has used\nAppleJeus malware posing as cryptocurrency trading platforms since\n\nat least 2018. The malware appears to be from a legitimate cryptocur­\nrency trading company to fool individuals into downloading it from\nwhat appears to be a legitimate website. Lazarus also uses phishing,\n\nsocial networking, and social engineering techniques to lure users into\ndownloading the malware.[195]\n\n\nl\nIn February 2021, the U.S. government unsealed a December 2020\n\nindictment against three North Korean hackers (Jon Chang-hyok,\nKim Il, and Park Jin-hyok) accused of committing a series of cyberat­\ntacks and attempting to steal or extort more than $1.3 billion worth\n\n\n-----\n\n**38** NORTH KOREAN CYBERATTACKS:\nA DANGEROUS AND EVOLVING THREAT\n\nof money and cryptocurrency from cyber heists and forced ATM\ncashouts. The case was an expansion of a 2018 case involving the Sony\nand WannaCry hacks. An accompanying case related to a Canadi­\nan-American citizen who pled guilty to money laundering.[196]\n\n\nl\nIn March 2021, for the first time, the U.S. extradited a North Korean\n\nintelligence operative from overseas. Mun Chol-myong, affiliated\nwith the Reconnaissance General Bureau, was accused of defrauding\nbanks and laundering money through the U.S. financial system “in\ntransactions valued at over $1.5 million” by using “a web of front com­\npanies and bank accounts registered to false names and remov[ing]\nreferences to [North Korea] from international wire transfer and\ntransactional documents.”[197]\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPECIAL REPORT | No. 247** September 2, 2021 | 39\nheritage.org\n\n###### Endnotes\n\n\n1.
