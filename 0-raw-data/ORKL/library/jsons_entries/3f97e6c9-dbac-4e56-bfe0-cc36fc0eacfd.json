Sajjan,\nMinister of National Defence, and the Honourable Bill Blair, Minister of Public Safety and\nEmergency Preparedness, issued the following statement: “Today, Canada joins its allies in\nidentifying People's Republic of China’s (PRC) state-backed actors for the unprecedented\nand indiscriminate exploitation of Microsoft exchange servers.\n\nJuly 19, 2021 – Ottawa, Ontario – Global Affairs Canada\n\nThe Honourable Marc Garneau, Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Honourable Harjit S. Sajjan,\nMinister of National Defence, and the Honourable Bill Blair, Minister of Public Safety and\nEmergency Preparedness, issued the following statement:\n\n“Today, Canada joins its allies in identifying People's Republic of China’s (PRC) statebacked actors for the unprecedented and indiscriminate exploitation of Microsoft exchange\nservers.\n\n“In early March 2021, Microsoft disclosed vulnerabilities in its exchange servers that were\nexploited by state actors. This activity put several thousand Canadian entities at risk—a risk\nthat persists in some cases even when patches from Microsoft have been applied. Globally,\nan estimated 400,000 servers have been affected.\n\n“Canada is confident that the PRC’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) is responsible for the\nwidespread compromising of the exchange servers.\n\n“Canada believes it is highly likely that this cyber activity was intended to gain access to\nnetworks worldwide for the theft of intellectual property and to acquire vast quantities of\npersonally identifiable information.\n\n“Several cyber groups from the PRC are believed to have taken part in this operation,\nincluding Advanced Persistent Threat Group 40 (APT 40). These actors are highly\nsophisticated and have demonstrated an ability to achieve sustained, covert access to\nCanadian and allied networks beyond the compromising of Microsoft exchange servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT 40 almost certainly consists of elements of the Hainan State Security Department s\nregional MSS office. This group’s cyber activities targeted critical research in Canada’s\ndefence, ocean technologies and biopharmaceutical sectors in separate malicious cyber\ncampaigns in 2017 and 2018.\n\n“Canada and its allies remain steadfast in their unity and solidarity in calling out\nirresponsible state-sponsored cyber activity. Canada will continue to release public\nattributions to make clear to perpetrators that it will expose malicious cyber activity\nconducted against Canada and its allies. Canada will continue to work in concert with\npartners on this crucial security issue.\n\n“Canada remains committed to working with partners to support the open, reliable and\nsecure use of cyberspace and calls on China to act responsibly and cease this pattern of\nirresponsible and harmful cyberspace behaviour. These kinds of reckless actions cannot be\naccepted and tolerated by responsible state-actors.\n\n“To further protect Canadians, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security has put out guidance\non mitigating the ongoing threat posed by Microsoft exchange server vulnerabilities.”\n\n## Additional information\n\nAdditional information regarding threat group from the PRC:\n\n**Threat Group: APT 40**\n**Public Names: Also publicly reported as Kryptonite Panda, TEMP.Periscope,**\nTEMP.Jumper, Bronze Mohawk, Leviathan, Mudcarp\n**Organizations: The PRC’s MSS and the Hainan State Security Department**\n**Targets: Regularly targets South Pacific governments (including Australia and New**\nZealand) and maritime and defence technologies\n\n## Associated Links:\n\n[Canada’s international cyber policy](https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/issues_development-enjeux_developpement/peace_security-paix_securite/cyber_policy-politique_cyberspace.aspx?lang=eng)\n[Active Exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Vulnerabilities - Update 4.](https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/alerts/active-exploitation-microsoft-exchange-vulnerabilities)\n[Canada Identifies China as Responsible for Cyber Compromise – December 2018](https://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/en/information-and-resources/announcements/canada-and-allies-identify-china-responsible-cyber)\n\n## Contacts\n\nSyrine Khoury\n\nPress Secretary\n\nOffice of the Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\n[Syrine.Khoury@international.gc.ca](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:Syrine.Khoury@international.gc.ca)\n\n\n-----\n\nDaniel Minden\nPress Secretary\nOffice of the Minister of National Defence\n613-996-3100\n[Daniel.Minden@forces.gc.ca](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:Todd.Lane@forces.gc.ca)\n\nMedia Relations Office\nCommunications Security Establishment\n[media@cse-cst.gc.ca](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:media@cse-cst.gc.ca)\n\nMadeleine Gomery\nPress Secretary\nOffice of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness\n613-292-0370\n[madeleine.gomery@ps-sp.gc.ca](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:madeleine.gomery@ps-sp.gc.ca)\n\nMedia Relations\nPublic Safety Canada\n613-991-0657\n[ps.mediarelations-relationsaveclesmedias.sp@ps-sp.gc.ca](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:ps.mediarelations-relationsaveclesmedias.sp@ps-sp.gc.ca)\n\nReport a problem or mistake on this page\nPlease select all that apply:\n\n**Date modified:**\n2021-07-19\n\n\n-----",
