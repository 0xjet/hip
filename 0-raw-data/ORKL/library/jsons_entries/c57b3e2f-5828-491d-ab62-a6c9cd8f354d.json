The research](http://10.10.0.46/applewebdata://EE3289EC-0D81-4BD2-8BC1-674841CE97AB#_ftn1)\nfound that FIN8, a financially motivated group, had used this toolkit to target victims in the\nchemicals, insurance, retail and technology sectors. We’ve expanded on Bitdefender’s\n[findings by using Pure Signal™ Recon to identify infrastructure currently in use by the group.](https://team-cymru.com/products/pure-signal-recon-threat-hunting-and-threat-reconnaissance/)\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nTwo IP addresses were provided in the Bitdefender paper, described as BADHATCH\ncommand and control IOCs, and were used as seeds for this investigation:\n\n104.168.145[.]204 (HOSTWINDS, US)\n192.52.167[.]199 (QUADRANET, US)\n\nBanner information was obtained for both IP addresses during December 2020, showing\nidentical strings on ports TCP/22 and TCP/80.\n\n**TCP/22: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.9p1 Debian-10+deb10u2**\n\n**TCP/80: HTTP/1.1 404 Server: nginx/1.14.1 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 Content-**\nLength: 14 Connection: Close\n\nPivoting on the string observed on TCP/80 ‘HTTP/1.1 404 Server: nginx/1.14.1 ContentType: text/plain; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 14 Connection: Close’, two further IP\naddresses were identified hosting the same banner information:\n\n89.45.4[.]192 (M247, US)\n108.62.118[.]100 (LEASEWEB, US)\n\nA further set of queries for the two ‘new’ IP addresses identified the same banner information\nbeing hosted on TCP/22 ‘SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.9p1 Debian-10+deb10u2’, as observed with\nthe original seeds.\n\nGiven the low volume of IP addresses [2] hosting the same banner information as observed\non the seed IP addresses, the two strings (when viewed in combination) were considered a\nviable fingerprint for connected FIN8 activity.\n\nNetwork traffic data was obtained for both 89.45.4[.]192 and 108.62.118[.]100 in order to help\nconfirm this assertion. These findings are summarised as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nRepeated established inbound connections, during the period 24 January – 13 March\n2021 (i.e., present day), to TCP/443 on both 89.45.4[.]192 and 108.62.118[.]100\nsourced from numerous potential victims:\n\nA Germany-based logistics company\nA Sweden-based engineering company\nAn US-based bank\nAn US-based credit union\nAn US-based engineering company\n\nSome evidence to suggest 89.45.4[.]192 taking over as the primary C2 on or around 20\nFebruary 2021.\n\nNote that the potential victims described above were notified of this activity prior to the\nrelease of this blog.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis investigation has highlighted two FIN8 command and control IP addresses, believed to\nbe in active use by the threat actors in targeting potential victims in Germany, Sweden and\nthe United States.\n\nTECHNICAL APPENDIX\n\nFIN8 C2s:\n\n89.45.4[.]192\n\n108.62.118[.]100\n\n[[1]](http://10.10.0.46/applewebdata://EE3289EC-0D81-4BD2-8BC1-674841CE97AB#_ftnref1) https://labs.bitdefender.com/2021/03/fin8-group-is-back-in-business-with-improvedbadhatch-kit/\n\n\n-----",
