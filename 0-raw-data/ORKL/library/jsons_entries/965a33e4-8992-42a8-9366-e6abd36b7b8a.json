It has rapidly become one of the most\nimportant and profitable malware families among Threat Actors (TAs). In a typical scenario, the\nransomware infection starts with the TA gaining access to the target system. Depending on the type of\nransomware, it can infect the entire operating system or encrypts individual files. The TAs will then\ntypically demand payment from the victim for the decryption of their files.\n\nWhile organizations are protecting themselves from ransomware attacks, new ransomware groups are\nalso emerging proportionally every year. New ransomware groups are evolving by expanding the scope of\ntheir operations for financial gain. Multiple new ransomware groups have emerged recently, highlighting\nthe widespread adoption of ransomware attacks by TAs for monetary growth.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) came across three new ransomware families: AXLocker,\nOctocrypt, and Alice Ransomware.\n\n## AXLocker Ransomware\n\nRansomware operators now have one newer tool, named AXLocker, which can encrypt several file types\nand make them completely unusable. Additionally, the ransomware steals Discord tokens from the\nvictim’s machine and sends them to the server. Later, a ransom note is displayed on the victim’s system\nto get the decryption tool used for recovering the encrypted files.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nWe have taken the following sample hash for our analysis: (SHA256),\n_c8e3c547e22ae37f9eeb37a1efd28de2bae0bfae67ce3798da9592f8579d433c, which is a 32-bit GUI-_\nbased .NET binary executable targeting Windows operating systems as shown below.\n\nFigure 1 – Static file details of AXLocker ransomware\nUpon execution, the ransomware hides itself by modifying the file attributes and calls the startencryption()\nfunction to encrypt files, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 – AXLocker main function\nThe startencryption() function contains code to search files by enumerating the available directories in the\nC:\\ drive. It looks for specific file extensions to encrypt and excludes a list of directories from the\nencryption process, as shown in the figure below.\n\nFigure 3 – File extension to encrypt and directories to exclude from encryption\nAfter that, the ransomware calls the ProcessFile function, which further executes an EncryptFile function\nwith the fileName as an argument to encrypt the victim’s system files.\n\nThis ransomware uses the AES encryption algorithm to encrypt files. The figure below shows a\nransomware code snippet searching and encrypting the victim’s files.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4 – AXLocker ransomware searching and encrypting files\nThe image below shows the code snippet of the encryption function and the original/infected file content\nbefore and after encryption.\n\nFigure 5 – Encryption function and the original/encrypted file content\n\n\n-----\n\nWe observed that the ransomware does not change the file name or extension after the encryption. The\nimage below shows the encrypted file of the ransomware after the successful infection on the victim’s\nmachine.\n\nFigure 6 – Encrypted file by AXLocker ransomware\nAfter encrypting the victim’s files, the ransomware collects and sends sensitive information such as\nComputer name, Username, Machine IP address, System UUID, and Discord tokens to TA, as shown in\nthe below figure.\n\nFigure 7 – Exfiltrate victim stolen details\nFor stealing Discord tokens, the malware targets the following directories:\n\n_Discord\\Local Storage\\leveldb_\n_discordcanary\\Local Storage\\leveldb_\n_discordptb\\leveldb_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Opera Software\\Opera Stable\\Local Storage\\leveldb_\n_Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\\\Default\\Local Storage\\leveldb_\n_BraveSoftware\\Brave-Browser\\User Data\\Default\\Local Storage\\leveldb_\n_Yandex\\YandexBrowser\\User Data\\Default\\Local Storage\\leveldb_\n\nIt uses regex to find the Discord tokens in the local storage files and saves them in the list, then sends\nthem to the Discord server along with other information using the below URL:\n\n_hxxps://discord[.]com/api/webhooks/1039930467614478378/N2J80EuPMXSWuIBpizgDJ-_\n_75[Redacted]DJimbA7xriJVmtb14gUP3VCBBZ0AZR_\n\nFigure 8 – Grab function to Steal Discord tokens\nFinally, the AXLocker ransomware shows a pop-up window that contains a ransom note that gives\ninstructions to victims on contacting the TAs to restore their encrypted files, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9 – AXLocker ransom note window\n\n## Octocrypt Ransomware\n\nOctocrypt is a new ransomware strain that targets all Windows versions. The ransomware builder,\nencryptor, and decryptor are written in Golang. The TAs behind Octocrypt operate under the\nRansomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) business model and surfaced on cybercrime forums around October\n2022 for USD400.\n\nThe Octocrypt ransomware has a simple web interface for building the encryptor and decryptor, and the\nweb panel also displays the infected victim’s details.\n\nThe below figure shows a post made by the Octocrypt Ransomware Developer on a cybercrime forum\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10 – Post Made by the Octocrypt developer on Cybercrime Forum\n\n## Ransomware Builder: Octocrypt\n\nThe Octocrypt web panel builder interface allows TAs to generate ransomware binary executables by\nentering options such as API URL, Crypto address, Crypto amount, and Contact email address.\n\nTAs can download the generated payload file by clicking the URL provided in the web panel under\npayload details. The below figure shows the payload options to build the ransomware executable and\ngenerated URL to download the file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11 – Octocrypt builder and payload URL\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThe sample hash\n(SHA256), 9a557b61005dded36d92a2f4dafdfe9da66506ed8e2af1c851db57d8914c4344, was taken for\nthis analysis.\n\nBased on static analysis, we found that the ransomware is a console-based 64-bit GoLang binary\nexecutable. Upon execution, the ransomware initially ensures the system’s internet connection and then\nchecks the TCP connection to access the API URL, as shown below.\n\nFigure 12 – Checking system internet and TCP connection\nAfter that, the malware starts the encryption process by enumerating the directories and encrypts the\nvictim’s files using the AES-256-CTR algorithm, appending the extension as “.octo”.\n\nThen, the ransomware drops the ransom note in multiple folders with the file name\n“INSTRUCTIONS.html”. Finally, the ransomware changes the victim’s wallpaper which displays a\nmessage that threatens the victim to send a ransom amount to a specific Monero wallet address, as\n\n\n-----\n\nshown below.\n\nFigure 13 – Octocrypt changing desktop background\n\n## Alice Ransowmare\n\nOne more new ransomware dubbed “Alice” also appeared on cybercrime forums under the TAs project of\n“Alice in the Land of Malware”. The Alice ransomware also works under the Ransomware-as-a-Service\n(RaaS) business model. The Indicators of Compromise of this ransomware strain are unavailable in the\nwild.\n\nThe figure below shows TA’s advertisements on a cybercrime forum.\n\nFigure 14 – Alice ransomware post shared by TA on a Cybercrime Forum\nThe TA sells this Alice ransomware builder for the prices listed below:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15 – Alice ransomware price details\nAs specified by the developer on the forum, the below figure shows the functionality and advantages of\nAlice ransomware.\n\nFigure 16 – Alice ransomware functionalities and advantages\n\n## Ransomware Builder: Alice\n\nThe Alice ransomware builder permits the TAs to generate ransomware binary files with a customized\nransom note. After entering the ransom message and clicking the “New Build” button in the builder, it will\ngenerate two executable files named “Encryptor.exe” and “Decryptor.exe”, as shown in the figure below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17 – Alice ransomware builder\nSuccessful execution of Alice ransomware encrypts the victim’s files and appends the extension as\n“.alice”. Also, the malware drops ransom notes named “How to Restore Your Files.txt” in multiple folders.\n\nThe below figure shows the encrypted files and dropped ransom note by Alice ransomware.\n\nFigure 18 – Encrypted files and dropped ransom note by Alice ransomware\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware groups continue to pose a serious risk to firms, individuals, and even entire governments,\nas we recently observed in the case of Costa Rica. The victims are at risk of losing valuable data as a\nresult of such attacks, resulting in financial and productivity loss. In extreme cases, compromising\ngovernment and law enforcement credentials can even result in cyberwarfare with grave implications for\nnational security and diplomatic relations.\n\nCRIL has also observed a considerable increase in cybercrime through Telegram channels and\ncybercrime forums where TAs sell their products without any regulation. TAs are increasingly attempting\nto maintain a low profile to avoid drawing the attention of Law Enforcement agencies. Enterprises need to\nstay ahead of the techniques used by TAs and implement the requisite security best practices and\nsecurity controls, or they will become the victims of increasingly sophisticated and aggressive\nransomware.\n\nRegularly monitoring the dark web and acting upon early warning indicators such as compromised\ncredentials, accesses, and identifying vulnerabilities traded on cybercrime forums can forewarn\nenterprises of potential threats and allows them to take corrective action based on real-time, actionable\nthreat intel. CRIL continuously monitors new ransomware campaigns and will keep our readers updated.\n\n## Our Recommendations\n\nWe have listed some of the essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control\nagainst attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:\n\n### Safety Measures Needed to Prevent Ransomware Attacks\n\nConduct regular backup practices and keep those backups offline or in a separate network.\nTurn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected\ndevices wherever possible and pragmatic.\nUse a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected devices,\nincluding PC, laptop, and mobile.\nRefrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their authenticity.\n\n### Users Should Take the Following Steps After the Ransomware Attack\n\nDetach infected devices on the same network.\nDisconnect external storage devices if connected.\nInspect system logs for suspicious events.\n\n### Impact And Cruciality of Ransomware\n\nLoss of valuable data.\nLoss of the organization’s reputation and integrity.\nLoss of the organization’s sensitive business information.\nDisruption in organization operation.\nFinancial loss.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK® Techniques\n\n**Tactic** **Technique ID** **Technique Name**\n\n\n-----\n\nExecution [T1204](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/)\n\n[T1059](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/)\n\n[T1047](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/)\n\nPersistence [T1547.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/)\n\n[T1053](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/)\n\n\nUser Execution\n\nCommand and Scripting Interpreter\nWindows Management Instrumentation\n\nRegistry Run Keys / Startup Folder\n\nScheduled Task/Job\n\n\nDefense Evasion [T1497](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/) Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion\n\nCredential Access [T1528](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528/) Steal Application Access Token\n\n\nDiscovery [T1087](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/)\n\n[T1082](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)\n\n[T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/)\n\n\nAccount Discovery\n\nSystem Information Discovery\n\nFile and Directory Discovery\n\n\nImpact [T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/) Data Encrypted for Impact\n\nCommand and Control [T1071](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/) Application Layer Protocol\n\nExfiltration [T1020](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020/) Automated Exfiltration\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Indicators** **Indicator**\n**type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\nAXLocker\n\nRansomware\n\nexecutable\n\nAXLocker\n\nRansomware\n\nexecutable\n\nAXLocker\n\nRansomware\n\nexecutable\n\nAXLocker\n\nRansomware\n\nexecutable\n\nAXLocker\n\nRansomware\n\nexecutable\n\nOctocrypt\n\nRansomware\n\nexecutable\n\nOctocrypt\n\nRansomware\n\nexecutable\n\n\nab2c19f4c79bc7a2527ab4df85c69559\n\n60a692c6eaf34a042717f54dbec4372848d7a3e3\n\nd51297c4525a9ce3127500059de3596417d031916eb9a52b737a62fb159f61e0\n\n07563c3b4988c221314fdab4b0500d2f\n\na5f53c9b0f7956790248607e4122db18ba2b8bd9\n\n0225a30270e5361e410453d4fb0501eb759612f6048ad43591b559d835720224\n\na18ac3bfb1be7773182e1367c53ec854\n\nc3d5c1f5ece8f0cf498d4812f981116ad7667286\n\nc8e3c547e22ae37f9eeb37a1efd28de2bae0bfae67ce3798da9592f8579d433c\n\n9be47a6394a32e371869298cdf4bdd56\n\nca349c0ddd6cda3a53ada634c3c1e1d6f494da8a\n\n9e95fcf79fac246ebb5ded254449126b7dd9ab7c26bc3238814eafb1b61ffd7a\n\nad1c2d9a87ebc01fa187f2f44d9a977c\n\n03d871509a7369f5622e9ba0e21a14a7e813536d\n\nd9793c24290599662adc4c9cba98a192207d9c5a18360f3a642bd9c07ef70d57\n\n346e7a626d27f9119b795c889881ed3d\n\nce25203215f689451a2abb52d24216aec153925a\n\n9a557b61005dded36d92a2f4dafdfe9da66506ed8e2af1c851db57d8914c4344\n\n5a39a2c4f00c44e727c3a66e3d5948c2\n\n07e7341b86ace9935c4f1062d41a94f3b31f9bf6\n\n65ad38f05ec60cabdbac516d8b0e6447951a65ca698ca2046c50758c3fd0608b\n\n\nMD5\n\nSHA-1\n\nSHA256\n\nMD5\n\nSHA-1\n\nSHA256\n\nMD5\n\nSHA-1\n\nSHA256\n\nMD5\n\nSHA-1\n\nSHA256\n\nMD5\n\nSHA-1\n\nSHA256\n\nMD5\n\nSHA-1\n\nSHA256\n\nMD5\n\nSHA-1\n\nSHA256\n\n\n-----\n\n2afdbca6a8627803b377adc19ef1467d\n\n13a0ce1c3ac688c55ba3f7b57fb6c09ad0e70565\n\ne65e3dd30f250fb1d67edaa36bde0fda7ba3f2d36f4628f77dc9c4e766ee8b32\n\n\nMD5\n\nSHA-1\n\nSHA256\n\n\nOctocrypt\n\nRansomware\n\nUPX packed\n\nexecutable\n\n\n-----",
