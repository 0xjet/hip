Yet the proliferation of binary-focused analysis enabled by\n\ntools such as VirusTotal that make samples available widely absent\n\nvictim and use context yield analysis lacking significant amplifying\n\ninformation. This is not to say that any specific malware analysis\n\nperformed is wrong, but rather that malware-exclusive analysis may\n\nmiss contextuality, significance, and use-cases that are vital aspects\n\nof understanding a security incident.\n\nLooking at some high-profile instances from the past four years of\n\nsecurity reporting, there are many examples of excellent technical\n\nreports in isolation which nonetheless miss some critical aspects of\n\ncertain security incidents or appear to indicate connections that\n\ngreater context reveals as unsupported. By incorporating other\n\naspects of security event analysis – host artifacts, network\n\ninfrastructure, network traffic, and where possible adversary\n\nmotivations and objectives – cyber threat intelligence analysts can\n\ngain greater, more accurate insight into activities.\n\nUltimately, threat intelligence producers will rarely have the “full\npicture” of an incident, but whether limited to malware or some other\nsingle aspect of an event, analysts must ensure that resulting products\nare properly dispositioned and resulting conclusions supported by the\navailable evidence. Threat intelligence consumers must realize the\nlimitations faced by producers and formulate their own analysis and\nintegration of third-party threat intelligence to incorporate other\nsources to fill in gaps where possible. Recognizing the limitations of\nanalysis based on small sample sizes using only a single analytical\nmethod means network defenders overall, and threat intelligence\npractitioners specifically, can accurately categorize observations and\napply controls and defenses in a supportable fashion.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe commercial threat intelligence field largely came into existence with the publication\nof the Mandiant APT1 report in 2013.[1] While previous reports on cyber threats existed,\nmany took the form of one-off blogs, or media stories lacking the analytic rigor currently\nassociated with cyber threat intelligence reporting.[2] Initially, non-government threat\nintelligence was limited to entities with direct access to data as a result of incident\nresponse work, security tool telemetry, or other direct exposure to events. However, the\nlaunch of VirusTotal by Spanish security company Hispasec significantly changed\nmatters.[3] Initially designed as a mechanism for users to perform security scans of files\nusing multiple anti-virus (AV) products on its debut in 2004, the service gradually\nexpanded (especially following acquisition by Google in 2012) to provide a paid service\nenabling researchers (and companies) beyond the participating AV vendors to retrieve\nfiles for analysis.\n\nWith this move, an entirely new field of security research opened with the availability of\na large corpus of malware samples beyond any researcher’s or company’s individual\nexperience and actions. While this resulted in an explosion of research and analysis of\nmalicious software, this shift also generated an ecosystem where threat intelligence and\nanalysis became increasingly dominated by pure malware analysis.\n\nThe question we as practitioners now face is, while the benefits of greater exposure,\nsharing, and availability have produced a dramatically larger corpus of analysis and\ninformation, has this effort come at a cost? This paper will argue that while malware\nanalysis offers significant benefits for generating threat intelligence, it is not perfect.\nParticularly, malware analysis on its own imposes certain limitations on contextuality\nand purpose, important items that are typically unavailable in pure binary or malware\nsample examination. Understanding these limitations and adjusting for them\nnonetheless allows defenders to incorporate this information, provided the results can\nbe placed in proper context.\n\n### Goal of Threat Intelligence\n\nThreat intelligence is typically defined as knowledge that enables defensive action,[4] or\nknowledge that allows for prevention or mitigation of attacks.[5] There are many\nexaminations producing more specific definitions, as well as multiple frameworks for\norganizing or systematizing threat intelligence information and knowledge, but these\ngeneral definitions are sufficient for our current purposes. More importantly, the\nfundamental goal of threat intelligence is to provide some mechanism for an\norganization to prepare for, or defend against, an event or attack which it has not already\n\n\n-----\n\nbeen the victim of; or, to provide mechanisms to identify an intrusion which may have\notherwise gone unnoticed.\n\nThus, threat intelligence’s value proposition to an organization comes explicitly from its\nability to enable and enhance operations. This can range from something as simple as\ndistributing raw observables or more refined indicators of compromise (IOC) to detailing\nattacker techniques and methodologies around which more complex (and robust)\ndefense can be built.[6] In either case, network defenders, or those charged with evaluating\n(and accepting) network security risk, should be able to extract actionable, practical\nvalue for threat intelligence to be of use. While information and reporting that does not\nmeet these criteria of usefulness and actionability may be quite interesting, for practical\ndefensive purposes they become so much “frictionless spinning in a void”.[7]\n\nFigure 1: Cyber Threat Intelligence Evolution\n\nUltimately, we want cyber threat intelligence to follow a sequence of actions yielding\ngreater understanding of the threat environment. Raw data analysis and IOC tracking\ngenerates the foundation upon which we can then begin to piece together different\nobservables to yield more general adversary behaviors. Based on these behaviors and\nadversary tendencies, defenders can begin articulating specific defensive measures and\nmitigations to counteract adversary behavior (or queries and searches to identify if that\nactor is already present). Additionally, organizational leadership can take portions of this\ninformation to judge the risk faced by their operation, either from specific behaviors or\ntechniques to which they may be susceptible or from certain types of actor based on\nassessed objectives and goals.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Investigation and Malware Analysis\n\nMalicious software, or malware, forms part of many (if not most) network security\nincidents, from highly complex, custom-developed binaries to scripting objects built\nfrom public repositories. Malware analysis is the practice of “dissecting malware to\nunderstand how it works, how to identify it, and how to defeat or eliminate it.”[8]\n\nThe progression of deliverables from understanding functionality, developing\nmechanisms to recognize, then building countermeasures against malware roughly fits\nthe criteria established above for threat intelligence. Analysis of a given sample should\nyield more than an investigation of an esoteric encoding/decoding routine or evasion\ntechnique, but also seek to identify practical mechanisms to identify and defeat these\ntechniques, or some other aspect of the malware’s functionality so as to inhibit its\neffectiveness and usefulness.\n\nHistorically, malware analysis took place either as part of a broader security\ninvestigation or incident response, or among small groups of researchers who could\nshare samples – and context around where the samples came from and their assessed\npurpose. In these cases, malware analysis came with contextuality: why it was\nsignificant, where it was located, how it was used, and what its immediate defensive\nimplications were. In the last decade or so, the proliferation of sample sharing and\ndistribution portals, whether commercial (VirusTotal) or free (Any.Run, Malshare)[9] have\nenabled wider distribution and greater availability of malware samples – but at the cost\nof stripping context from them.\n\nWhile samples now lack valuable contextual information surrounding their use and\norigin, much of the process of malware analysis can nonetheless take place. As a result,\npurely technical analysis can flourish, removed from any grounding in network or security\noperations.\n\n### Issues, Concerns, and Limitations\n\nMalware analysis is an important, and often invaluable, portion of overall threat\nintelligence operations. Yet malicious file analysis also represents but one technique\namong many for understanding and analyzing adversary behavior. Understanding\nmalware functionality (and how to defeat it) is undeniably important, but in isolation\nfrom other factors or absent execution context it may be significantly less useful than it\notherwise would be with additional, enriching information.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Security Incident Components\n\n\nA security incident consists of three general components: host artifacts and tools;\nnetwork data and traffic analysis; and adversary objectives or intentions. A ransomware\nattack would consist of the specific ransomware malware involved, the means through\nwhich it propagated across the network, or entered into the environment in the first place\nand the adversary’s purpose (ostensibly to make money, although items such as\nNotPetya can muddy these waters)[10]. Yet a malware-specific approach to such an\ninvestigation, especially if the only data source is a sample sharing service, provides\nonly the ransomware as an object for investigation and analysis. There is much that can\nbe learned from the sample, but depending on its functionality, there may be multiple\nother steps or necessary observables required to identify critical defensive needs – such\nas propagation mechanisms, host artifacts specific to the victim’s network (as opposed\nto the analysis environment), network traffic patterns, and related information. Malware\nanalysis on its own only gets us part of the way to answering these questions in many\ncircumstances.\n\n\n-----\n\nExamining specific circumstances, where an overemphasis on malware analysis was\nused to formulate conclusions, we can identify cases not necessarily representing\nmistakes, but where matters were less useful than they could be or failed to capture\ncertain degrees of nuance. Thus, analysts generated and disseminated threat\nintelligence, but the resulting product may not have been as complete, accurate, or useful\nlacking broader event context from other sources and analytical mechanisms.\n\n##### 2016 UKRAINE POWER EVENT\n\nThe 2016 Ukraine power event represented the first known electric power incident\ninduced through malware.[11] While some preliminary conference talks addressed the\nevent along with media reporting, the first technically detailed, published report was\nESET’s analysis of Industroyer, followed by publication under the name CRASHOVERRIDE\nby Dragos. ESET’s report appeared to cover multiple phases of the intrusion, which\ninitially seemed to originate from a remote access tool (RAT) facilitating network access\nwhich enabled deployment of the actual electric transmission manipulation software.\nThe tools were grouped as distinct stages in a single intruder event, building up along\ntypical kill chain steps to final actions on objectives through the ICS payload. From a\npure malware analysis perspective, this approach makes sense as the identification of\nthe set of tools associated with the incident including a backdoor or RAT combined with\nindustrial control-specific malware indicates that the former would be used to position\nand then execute the latter.\n\nWhile initial analysis of the malware is accurate in terms of each sample’s capability, the\nabsence of contextual incident information left some items (such as additional\nadversary actions to enable malware installation) unexplained. There were some hints\nin public talks and media reporting as to the greater scope of the event, but no in-depth,\nwritten technical coverage.[12] Reports emerging years after the event, in 2018 and 2019,\neventually addressed in detail how multiple tools were in play in the victim network, and\nexecution of the industrial control system (ICS) specific portion of the attack does not\nappear necessarily linked to the backdoor.[13] Furthermore, while some such as Oleksii\nYasynskyi had publicly hinted that multiple entities were likely involved in the 2016 power\nevent,[14] more recent review of events shows apparently different adversary intrusion\ntechniques in play. Enterprise IT intrusion steps displayed a significantly different set of\nbehaviors than the ICS-focused portion of the attack. This observed bifurcation appeared\nto confirm a multiple actor intrusion hypothesis.\n\nA few years after the incident, ESET identified new malware, called EXARAMEL, with\nsignificant functional overlap with the 2016 Ukraine event backdoor. Based on the\ntechnical overlap and a malware-centric investigative approach, previous analysis\nlooking at the power event as a single-actor incident supported transitive attribution that\nthe users (or at least authors) of EXARAMEL were also responsible for not merely the\n\n\n-----\n\nIndustroyer backdoor, but the overall 2016 Ukraine power event. In the case of\nEXARAMEL, ESET analysts were able to link this malware to TeleBots, known elsewhere\nas Sandworm.[15] Given past analysis and the backdoor code overlap, by extension 2016\nUkraine appears to become a Sandworm event.\n\nYet analysis incorporating information from the victim environment and the overall\nintrusion – not available if conducting or limited to pure binary analysis – indicates a\nmore subtle operation as outlined above. Instead of a single, monolithic intrusion, the\n2016 Ukraine event appears to be a case where at least two distinct teams were\noperating at different stages of the incident: Sandworm serving as an initial access and\npenetration team, handing over access to ELECTRUM as an ICS-specialist group to\nperform final control system network penetration and the ICS attack.\n\nKey points establishing this differentiation center around the Sandworm-linked backdoor\nsimilar to EXARAMEL. Analyzing available event data shows no evidence that the\nbackdoor is linked to the introduction of the ICS attack payloads, or in their execution in\nthe victim environment. Instead, these stages of the incident use separate sets of\ntechniques, including simple scripting, built-in operating system tools, and credential reuse. Additionally, network infrastructure associated with the backdoor maps to known\nSandworm tendencies (e.g., using servers also functioning as TOR infrastructure at the\ntime of the incident), while other network infrastructure more closely aligned with the\nICS-specific portion of events lack these characteristics. A summary of these\ndifferences is provided in Figure 3 below.\n\n\nFigure 3: SANDWORM and ELECTRUM Comparison in 2016 Ukraine\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile initial reporting on Industroyer/CRASHOVERRIDE within the context of the 2016\nUkraine event provided significant information for defensive response, it did so largely\nin context of observed malware alone. Thus, the picture provided was incomplete and\nlacked insight into, and coverage of, critical aspects of the event: penetration of the\ncontrol system network and execution of potentially destructive malware in the\nenvironment.[16] Once additional, detailed information became available, a more thorough\nanalysis became possible, yielding not only distinct phases of adversary operation (one\nrelying mostly on custom malware, the other primarily on “living off the land”\ntechniques), but possibly distinct entities involved in the event as well. From a threat\nintelligence application, this more complete picture empowers more effective, broader\nreaching defense.\n\n##### ACTOR LINKING ON TOOLS\n\nOne common methodology in malware-focused threat intelligence, observed to some\ndegree in the discussion above given connections between the Industroyer backdoor and\nEXARAMEL, is grouping activity based on tool use and design. However, while ESET’s\nanalysis of EXARAMEL strongly suggests additional telemetry was used to tie\nEXARAMEL to Sandworm, many other similar assessments are made purely on malware\nanalysis alone. In these cases, analysts can quickly reach problematic conclusions as\nthey effectively focus more on developers or capability sources rather than actors or\nexecutors.\n\nThe most obvious cases where researchers can get into difficulty concerns publicly- or\ncommercially available tools. As attackers have broadened arsenals away from primary\nreliance on custom-developed malware for operations to embrace a combination of open\nsource (e.g., Mimikatz)[17], criminal source (e.g., PlugX)[18], and commercial (e.g.,\nCobaltStrike)[19] tools, linking activity to an entity or campaign based purely on tool use\nbecomes very problematic. The proliferation of tools such as PlugX, ChinaChopper,\nnjRAT, and the host of open-source libraries now used by attackers make tool-centric\nattribution increasingly weak in many cases. This can result in attribution errors, which\nin turn can lead to false assumptions on other aspects of the given attack lifecycle –\nsuch as accompanying, expected behaviors and attacker objectives. The result is\ninaccurate or faulty overall threat intelligence that can lead to problematic or erroneous\nresponses.\n\nA more interesting variant of this phenomenon of tool tracking occurs when considering\ndevelopment and division of labor for threat actors. Malicious cyber entities need not be\nmonolithic bodies with dedicated development resources working exclusively to support\na certain threat actor. Instead, for the most complex and well-resourced entities,\nseparate operational teams are likely supported by development shops, contractors, or\neven commercial acquisition. These entities in turn may contribute tools and capabilities\n\n\n-----\n\nto multiple distinct entities. Furthermore, in shallow pools of elite talent, individual\ndevelopers and related entities may shift jobs or roles resulting in similar coding patterns\nand technical “tells” migrating with individuals or even contracted teams when they\nbegin supporting a different entity. Thus, tracking even custom tools may reveal more\nabout developers than it yields on operational teams and their objectives.\n\nSome headline discoveries on what appear to be clusters of activity – such as Animal\nFarm or Equation Group-related malware[20] – may therefore track development resources\nand not actual operational teams.\n\n\nFigure 5: Tool Usage Compared to Operational Authority and Execution Figure 4: Operational and Tasking Relationships\n\n\nAs outlined in Figure 4, complex, well-resourced entities (such as state-sponsored\nactivities) feature multiple tiers and centers of activity from operational or national\ncommand authority through various tool and capability development shops until finally\nreaching operational teams. The various entities operating may overlap, follow similar\noperational and technical guidance, or in some cases (such as distinct “splits” in state\n\n\n-----\n\npower centers, such as NSA vs. CIA in the United States, FSB/SVR vs. GRU in Russia, or\nMOIS vs. IRGC in Iran) entities serving similar interests or goals may operate in\ncompletely different ways.\n\n\nFigure 5: Tool Usage Compared to Operational Authority and Execution\n\n\nWhile the technical analysis linking groups in efforts such as Animal Farm, Equation\n\nGroup, the totality of legacy Sandworm reporting, and similar items reflects excellent\n\nmalware analysis capability, lack of additional context or exposure to precise lines of\n\ndevelopment, communication, and operation mean specific relationships can be\n\nobscured. Looking at something like Equation Group-related tooling, researchers may\n\nhave identified a common contractor working for multiple distinct entities instead of\nidentifying some overarching, coordinated development program for advanced malware\n\ntools shared among partnering organizations. The latter possibility certainly exists, but\n\nits provability remains relatively low in likelihood absent additional information beyond\n\nmalware samples to tie identified tools to specific actors and objectives.\n\nVisualizing a division of labor emblematic of complex, bureaucratic systems means\nintentions, capabilities, and actions are handed off between multiple discrete entities.\nSome of these entities may solely support given actors at different levels, while others\nshift depending on tasking, priorities, and resource requirements. Thus, as shown in\nFigure 5, specific tool continuity may persist among different actors for a specific\noperation or goal, but need not hold for future operations that require different coalitions\nof actors and entities to achieve actions on objectives.\n\n\n-----\n\nNone of this should be construed as saying the binary analysis in work cited above is\nsomehow wrong. Rather, this serves as a caution that the perceived relationships yielded\nthrough a single type of data and a single type of analysis can (and almost certainly will)\npossess holes or permit misconceptions to proliferate. Drawing overarching conclusions\nfrom such activity and bundling this into guidance and threat intelligence may therefore\nbroadcast relationships that are far different to what they may seem through a\ncircumscribed field of view.\n\n##### LOOKBACK AND APT10\n\nFinally, malware analysis is subject to adversaries who may deliberately manipulate\ntooling or take advantage of potential researcher biases to induce inconclusive or\nmisleading results. While examples of interesting “false flags” exist such as Olympic\nDestroyer,[21] a more recent and potentially interesting example can be found in phishing\nactivity targeting North American electric utilities in 2019. From August to September\n2019, researchers at Proofpoint identified a phishing campaigned they call LookBack,\nutilizing spoofed network infrastructure and emails to deliver malware to electric\nutilities.[22]\n\nSpecific aspects of this phishing campaign were exceptionally strange as they seemed\nto completely replicate techniques employed by a different entity, thought to be APT10,\nthat were publicly disclosed in great detail nearly a year prior by FireEye.[23] Examples of\nnear identical overlap include campaign-specific items from 2018 events such as\nmimicking the Generic Updater (GUP) service used by Notepad++ and using a version of\nWindows LIBCURL with a malicious exported function to obscure execution. Overall,\nLookBack appears to be either APT10 completely replaying known tradecraft in a new\nincident, or a very deliberate attempt to mimic well-known behaviors associated with\nAPT10.\n\n\nFigure 6: LockBack Exploitation and Execution Chain\n\n\n-----\n\nThis precise adherence to disclosed, legacy tradecraft raises many questions.\nPresumably, given detailed previous public reporting, an adversary demonstrating past\nsophistication and dedicated support or development resources to enable campaigns\nsuch as Cloud Hopper would not resort to such an obvious replay of known techniques.[24]\nIf we accept this premise (and it must be noted, this is an assumption, and adversaries\ncan certainly be lazy), then some other entity would need to be involved. The resulting\npossible conclusion would be an entity working to look like APT10.\n\nAlthough incomplete given the relatively small number of available samples from this\nevent, there are some subtle indications that the document dropper may share some\ndesign and functionality overlap with document droppers previously used by entities\nlinked to North Korean interests from 2016 through 2017.[25] In addition to this potential\ntechnical overlap, there is also precedent for North Korean-related entities targeting the\nUS electric sector via phishing with spoofed documents to drop and execute encoded\nmalware.[26] Thus two datapoints emerge which may suggest an alternative explanation\nfor the observed activity.\n\nWhile threat attribution may seem a lower priority than identifying the attack\nmechanisms and defenses, from a threat intelligence informing operations perspective\nit is significant in this case given the substantial differences in likely adversary\nobjectives. For example, APT10 is associated with long-running access and information\ngathering operations with no publicly known instances leveraging intrusions for\ndeliberate disruption or destruction. Meanwhile, the North Korean linked activity, while\nalso encompassing some traditional intelligence collection, extends to potentially\ndisruptive activity such as cryptocurrency mining and financial theft, and deliberate\ndisruptive behavior such as ransomware or wipers. Thus, attribution based on this\ninformation has implications for just what risks a potential victim would face from a\npotential LookBack-related intrusion, and the appropriate responses for mitigating them.\n\nOverall, this campaign represents a case where it is simply too early (given available\ninformation) to make either assessment, at least with a high degree of confidence. To\nthe original reporter’s credit, this uncertainty is documented and reflected in public\nreleases around LookBack. While Proofpoint articulated their reporting with proper\ncaveats and estimative language, in many cases temptations exist to take limited\ninformation born solely of analysis of a handful of samples to make claims which may\nnot withstand further scrutiny. Worse yet, in some cases analysis based on small sample\nsets may become revealed as outright false with additional evidence. Given limited\ninformation, threat intelligence based on a single analytical technique and a handful of\nsamples must realize the limitations imposed on any conclusions. Finally, these\nlimitations must be clearly and explicitly communicated to recipients so they can\ndisposition the resulting report and intelligence appropriately.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Defensive Options and Implications\n\nNone of the above represent existential threat intelligence issues, but these examples\nillustrate how analytic tendencies and dependencies can yield less than ideal results.\nThis covers both threat intelligence producers, who must be cognizant of the limitations\nthat narrow, incomplete source analysis place on conclusions, and threat intelligence\nconsumers, who need to assess received reporting considering how it was produced to\ndetermine actual relevance and efficacy.\n\nMalware analysis will remain a very important aspect of threat intelligence production\nfor the foreseeable future. But understanding precisely how it fits in to the overall\nintelligence analysis and production process is necessary to ensure practitioners and\nconsumers do not assign greater confidence to matters than necessary. Thus, defenders\ncan still extract value from even a single source of malicious software – but must\nappropriately couch analysis, recognizing what inherent limitations are thus placed on\nconclusions given lack of amplifying information or contextual clues. Use of proper\nestimative language, confidence levels, and related techniques can allow threat\nintelligence producers to adequately and accurately disposition results.\n\nFrom a threat intelligence consumer perspective, the nature of threat intelligence\nproduction means that in many cases reports will be based on limited or incomplete\ndata, especially for new or emerging items. Knowing this limitation, especially in the case\nof single-source analysis such as a malware-only report, can allow defenders to\ntherefore properly assess the strength and applicability of such a report and its findings.\nFurthermore, knowing this limitation means threat intelligence consumers cannot be\nmerely passive recipients, but must engage in active research, analysis, and correlation\nof sources to identify potential holes and limitations in received information. This may\nseem undesirable as essentially reproducing the analysis and production stage of the\nintelligence cycle. Yet defenders and threat intelligence consumers must apply allsource analysis and cross-source correlation to identify and, where possible, fill in\nimportant contextual gaps.\n\nThreat intelligence practitioners must understand the limitations placed on certain types\nof analysis, accept that limited sourcing or single-analysis examination will leave holes,\nand report such items with the proper use of estimative language and justifiable\nconclusions. Organizations can still produce valuable, actional intelligence, but by\nadding these extra steps and recognizing limitations in techniques, practitioners can\ngenerate better reporting at appropriate levels of confidence. Furthermore, while this\nspecific report focused only on malware analysis, this is just an example as similar\nissues can emerge in pure network infrastructure tracking (especially when pivoting to\nidentify related items), or analysis based on a single incident where many observations\nmay be specific to the victim environment.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe increased availability of malware samples to companies and\nresearchers has energized and broadened the field of cyber threat\nintelligence, allowing for new discoveries and enhancing defense.\nHowever, while beneficial in multiple ways, many aspects of the\nindustry may rely too much on this single form of analysis and place\ngreater confidence in discoveries from isolated malware samples than\nis justified. Threat intelligence practitioners and consumers must\ntherefore work to understand the limitations of any single-source,\nsmall sample size examination, and measure expectations and\nevaluations appropriately. Furthermore, this concern is neither unique\nnor limited to malware analysis as a discipline, but applies to all facets\nof threat intelligence.\n\nWhen analyzing events or campaigns, threat intelligence professionals\nmust work toward integrating as many data sources and samples as\npossible to produce high-confidence analysis. Recognizing that this is\nnot always possible, organizations must then ensure appropriate\nestimative language and confidence assessments are applied to\nensure conclusions are sound and that analytical leaps and pivots are\nclearly identified, underlying logic is justified, and analytical leaps\nsupportable through some evidence. Working in this fashion, the field\nof cyber threat intelligence can continue moving forward, yielding\nappropriately beneficial and actionable results to consumers, enabling\nimproved defenses.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Notes\n\n1 APT1 – FireEye (https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeyewww/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf)\n\n2 One possible exception predating the APT1 report is McAfee’s Operation Shady Rat\n(http://www.csri.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wp-operation-shady-rat1.pdf).
