However, it has been operational since August 2021, when\na threat actor used it to attack U.S. corporations. Said attack shared similar TTPs with\n[ransomware Thieflock, designed by Fivehands ransomware gangs. This connection alluded](https://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/in-depth-look-at-yanluowang-ransomware)\nto a possible link between the two through the presence or influence of an affiliate. The\ngroup has been known for successfully ransoming organisations globally, particularly those\nin the financial, manufacturing, IT services, consultancy, and engineering sectors.\n\nYanluowang attacks typically begin with initial reconnaissance, followed by credential\nharvesting and data exfiltration before finally encrypting the victim’s files. Once deployed on\ncompromised networks, Yanluowang halts hypervisor virtual machines, all running processes\nand encrypts files using the “.yanluowang” extension. A file with name README.txt,\ncontaining a ransom note is also dropped. The note also warns victims against contacting\nlaw enforcement, recovery companies or attempting to decrypt the files themselves. Failure\nto follow this advice would result in distributed denial of service attacks against a victim, its\nemployees and business partners. Followed by another attack, a few weeks later, in which all\nthe victim’s files would be deleted.\n\nThe group’s name “Yanluowang” was inspired by the Chinese mythological figure\nYanluowang, suggesting the group’s possible Chinese origin. However, the recent leak of\nchat logs belonging to the group, revealed those involved in the organisation spoke Russian.\n\n## Leak of Yanluowang’s chat logs\n\nOn the 31st of October, a Twitter user named @yanluowangleaks shared the matrix chat\nand server leaks of the Yanluowang ransomware gang, alongside the builder and decryption\nsource. In total, six files contained internal conversations between the group’s members.\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the analysis of these chats, at least eighteen people have been involved in\nYanluowang operations.\n\n_Figure 1: Twitter account where the leaks and decryption source were shared_\n**‍**\n\n**Potential members: ‘@killanas', '@saint', '@stealer', '@djonny', '@calls', '@felix', '@win32',**\n'@nets', '@seeyousoon', '@shoker', '@ddos', '@gykko', '@loader1', '@guki', '@shiwa',\n'@zztop', '@al', '@coder1'‍\n\n**Most active members: ‘@saint’, ‘@killanas’, ‘@guki’, ‘@felix’, ‘@stealer’.**\n\nTo make the most sense out of the data that we analyzed, we combined the findings into two\ncategories: tactics and organization.‍\n\n## Tactics ‍\n\nFrom the leaked chat logs, several insights into the group’s operational security and TTPs\nwere gained. Firstly, members were not aware of each other’s offline identities. Secondly,\ndiscussions surrounding security precautions for moving finances were discussed by\nmembers @killanas and @felix. The two exchanged recommendations on reliable currency\nexchange platforms as well as which ones to avoid that were known to leak data to law\nenforcement. The members also expressed paranoia over being caught with substantial\namounts of money and therefore took precautions such as withdrawing smaller amounts of\ncash or using QR codes for withdrawals.\n\nAdditionally, the chat logs exposed the TTPs of Yanluowang. Exchanges between the\ngroup’s members @stealer, @calls and @saint, explored the possibilities of conducting\nattacks against critical infrastructure. One of these members, @call, was also quick to\n\n\n-----\n\nemphasise that Yanluowang would not target the critical infrastructure of former Soviet\ncountries. Beyond targets, the chat logs also highlighted Yanluowang’s use of the\nransomware, PayloadBIN but also that attacks that involved it may potentially have been\nmisattributed to another ransomware actor, Evil Corp.\n\nFurther insight surrounding Yanluowang’s source code was also gained as it was revealed\nthat it had been previously published on XSS.is as a downloadable file. The conversations\nsurrounding this revealed that two members, @killanas and @saint, suspected @stealer\nwas responsible for the leak. This suspicion was supported by @saint, defending another\nmember whom he had known for eight years. It was later revealed that the code had been\nshared after a request to purchase it was made by a Chinese national. @saint also used\ntheir personal connections to have the download link removed from XSS.is. These\nconnections indicate that some members of Yanluowang are well embedded in the\nransomware and wider cybercrime community.\n\nAnother insight gained from the leaked chat logs was an expression by @saint in support of\nUkraine, stating, “We stand with Ukraine” on the negotiation page of Yanluowang’s website.\n[This action reflects a similar trend observed among threat actors where they have taken](https://de.darktrace.com/blog/threat-actor-tactics-in-the-russo-ukrainian-conflict-analyst-observations-and-predictions)\nsides in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nRegarding Yanluowang’s engagement with other groups, it was found that a former member\nof Conti had joined the group. This inference was made by @saint when a conversation\nregarding the Conti leak revolved around the possible identification of the now Yanluowang\nmember @guki, in the Conti files. It was also commented that Conti was losing a\nconsiderable number of its members who were then looking for new work. Conversations\nabout other ransomware groups were had with the mentioning of the REVIL group by\n@saint, specifically stating that five arrested members of the gang were former classmates.\nHe backed his statement by attaching the article about it, to which @djonny replies that\nthose are indeed REVIL members and that he knows it from his sources.‍\n\n## Organization ‍\n\nWhen going through the chat logs, several observations were made that can offer some\ninsights into the group's organizational structure. In one of the leaked files, user @saint was\nthe one to publish the requirements for the group's \".onion\" website and was also observed\ninstructing other users on the tasks they had to complete. Based on this, @saint could be\nconsidered the leader of the group. Additionally, there was evidence indicating that a few\nusers could be in their 30s or 40s, while most participants are in their 20s.\n\nMore details regarding Yanluowang's organizational structure were discussed deeper into the\nleak. The examples indicate various sub-groups within the Yanlouwang group and that a\nspecific person coordinates each group. From the logs, there is a high probability that\n@killanas is the leader of the development team and has several people working under him.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is also possible that @stealer is on the same level as @killanas and is potentially the\nsupervisor of another team within the group. This was corroborated when @stealer\nexpressed concerns about the absence of certain group members on several occasions.\nThere is also evidence showing that he was one of three people with access to the source\ncode of the group.\n\nRole delineation within the group was also quite clear, with each user having specific tasks:\nDDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks, social engineering, victim negotiations,\npentesting or development, to mention a few. When it came to recruiting new members,\nmostly pentesters, Yanluowang would recruit through XSS.is and Exploit.in forums.‍\n\n**Underground analysis and members’ identification ‍**\n\nFrom the leaked chat logs, several “.onion” URLs were extracted; however, upon further\ninvestigation, each site had been taken offline and removed from the TOR hashring. This\nsuggests that Yanluowang may have halted all operations. One of the users on XSS.is\nposted a picture showing that the Yanluowang onion website was hacked, stating,\n“CHECKMATE!! YANLUOWANG CHATS HACKED @YANLUOWANGLEAKS TIME’S UP!!”.‍\n\n_Figure 2: The screenshot of Yanluowang website on Tor (currently offline)_\nAfter learning that Yanluowang used Russian Web Forums, we did an additional search to\nsee what we could find about the group and the mentioned nicknames.\n\nBy searching through XSS.Is we managed to identify the user registered as @yanluowang.\nThe date of the registration on the forum dates to 15 March 2022. Curiously, at the time of\nanalysis, we noticed the user was online. There were in total 20 messages posted by\n@yanluowang, with a few publications indicating the group is looking for new pentesters.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: The screenshot of Yanluowang profile on XSS.is_\n‍\n\n_Figure 4: The screenshot of Yanluowang posts about pentester recruitment on XSS.is_\nWhile going through the messages, it was noticed the reaction posted by another user\nidentified as @Sa1ntJohn, which could be the gang member @saint.\n\n‍Figure 5: The screenshot of Sa1ntJohn’s profile on XSS.is\n_‍Looking further, we identified that user @Ekranoplan published three links to the website_\ndoxbin.com containing information about three potential members of the YanLuoWang gang:\n@killanas/coder, @hardbass and @Joe/Uncle. The profile information was published by the\nuser @Xander2727.‍\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: The screenshot of Yanlouwang member-profile leak on XSS.is_\n\n_Figure 7: The screenshot of @hardbass Yanlouwang member profile leak_\n\n_Figure 8: The screenshot of @killanas/coder Yanlouwang member profile leak._\n_‍If the provided information is correct, two group members are Russian and in their 30s, while_\nanother member is Ukrainian and in his 20s. One of the members, @killanas, who was also\nreferenced in chat logs, is identified as the lead developer of the Yanluowang group; giving\nthe interpretation of the chat leaks a high-level of confidence. Another two members, who\nwere not referenced in the logs, took roles as Cracked Software/Malware provider and\nEnglish translator/Victim Negotiator.‍\n\n## Implications for the wider ransomware landscape‍\n\nTo conclude with the potential implications of this leak, we have corroborated the evidence\ngathered throughout this investigation and employed contrarian analytical techniques. The\nascertained implications that follow our mainline judgement, supporting evidence and our\ncurrent analytical view on the matter can be categorized into three key components of this\nleak:\n\n## ‍Impact on the ransomware landscape‍\n\nThe leak of Yanluowang’s chat logs has several implications for the broader ransomware\nlandscape. This leak, much like the Conti leak in March, spells the end for Yanluowang\noperations for the time being, given how much of the group’s inner workings it has exposed.\nThis could have an adverse effect. While Yanluowang did not control as large of a share of\n\n\n-----\n\nthe ransomware market as Conti did, their downfall will undoubtedly create a vacuum space\nfor established groups for their market share. The latter being a consequence of the release\nof their source code and build tools.\n\n## ‍Source code‍\n\nThe release of Yanluowang’s source code has several outcomes. If the recipients have no\nmalintent, it could aid in reverse engineering the ransomware, like how a decryption tool for\nYanluowng was released earlier this year. An alternative scenario is that the publication of\nthe source code will increase the reach and deployment of this ransomware in the future, in\nadapted or modified versions by other threat actors. Reusing leaked material is notorious\namong ransomware actors, as seen in the past, when Babuk’s source code was leaked and\nled to the development of several variants based on this leak, including Rook and Pandora.\nThis could also make it harder to attribute attacks to one specific group.\n\n## ‍Members‍\n\nThe migration of unexposed Yanluowang members to other ransomware gangs could further\nadd to the proliferation of ransomware groups. Such forms of spreading ransomware have\nbeen documented in the past when former Conti members repurposed their tactics to join\nefforts with an initial access broker, UAC-0098. Yet, the absence of evidence from members\nexpressing and/or acting upon this claim requires further investigation and analysis.\nHowever, as there is no evidence of absence – this implication is based on the previously\nobserved behavior from members of other ransomware gangs.\n\n\n-----",
