The websites targeted encompass Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Amazon,\neBay, and Etsy.\n\n\"The stealer signs into victims' social media platforms using stolen cookies, and extracts account\ninformation like Facebook Ads-manager to run malicious advertisements with stored payment\nmethods and Instagram via API to steal personal information,\" the researchers said.\n\nFFDroider also comes with a downloader functionality to upgrade itself with new modules from an\nupdate server that allows it expand its feature set over time, enabling malicious actors to abuse the\nstolen data as a vector for initial access to a target.\n\n\n-----\n\nMain Function of Lightning Stealer\n\nLightning stealer operates in a similar fashion in that it can steal Discord tokens, data from\ncryptocurrency wallets, and details pertaining to cookies, passwords, credit cards, and search\nhistory from more than 30 Firefox and Chromium-based browsers, all of which is exfiltrated to a\nserver in JSON format.\n\n[\"Info Stealers are adopting new techniques to become more evasive,\" Cyble researchers said,](https://blog.cyble.com/2022/04/05/inside-lightning-stealer/)\nadding it \"witnessed ransomware groups leveraging Info Stealers to gain initial network access and,\neventually, exfiltrating sensitive data.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\nThe development comes as stealer malware is becoming an increasingly common occurrence\nacross different attack campaigns in recent months, in part to fill the void left by Raccoon Stealer's\nexit from the market in late March due to the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\n[In February 2022, Cyble Research disclosed details of an emerging threat called Jester Stealer](https://blog.cyble.com/2022/02/24/jester-stealer-an-emerging-info-stealer/)\nthat's engineered to steal and transmit login credentials, cookies, credit card information along with\ndata from passwords managers, chat messengers, email clients, crypto wallets, and gaming apps\nto the attackers.\n\n[Since then, at least three different info-stealers have emerged in the wild, including BlackGuard,](https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/experts-shed-light-on-blackguard.html)\n[Mars Stealer, and](https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/researchers-expose-mars-stealer-malware.html) [META, the last of which has been observed delivered via malspam campaigns to](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Windows+MetaStealer+Malware/28522/)\ncollect sensitive data.\n\n\n-----\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
