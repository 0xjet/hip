    "plain_text": "# NANHAISHU\n\n## RATing the South China Sea\n\n### TLP: White\n\n\n-----\n\n#### SUMMARY\n\nThis whitepaper details a malicious program we identify as NanHaiShu. Based on our analysis, the threat\nactor behind this malware targets government and private-sector organizations. Notable targets of\nthe malware include the Department of Justice of the Philippines, the organizers of the Asia-Pacific\nEconomic Cooperation (APEC) Summit and a major international law firm.\n\nWe believe these entities were targeted for their involvement in a dispute centering on the South China\nSea. The conflicting territorial claims at the heart of the issue were addressed by an international tribunal\non 12[th ]July 2016[[1]]. Based on the specific selection of organizations targeted for attack by this malware, as\nwell as indications revealed in our technical analysis of the malware itself, we believe the threat actor to\nbe of Chinese origin.\n\nWe saw the first sample of NanHaiShu in the wild for the last couple years, and as of March 2016, it is still\nbeing actively distributed. Technically speaking, the malware is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that is\nspread in spearphishing email messages which contain the malware as a malicious file attachment. The\ncontents of the email message include, among other things, industry-specific terms that indicate they\nwere deliberately designed with the specific targets in mind.\n\nThe attached file contains a VBA macro that executes an embedded JScript file. It is likely that the threat\nactor knew the targets use VBA macros in their business environment, since the attack only works if the\ndefault security setting in Microsoft Office is modified to allow macro execution.\n\nOnce installed on a machine in the target network, NanHaiShu sends information from the infected\nmachine to a remote command and control (C&C) server.\n\n\n###### F-SECURE LABS THREAT INTELLIGENCE\nMalware analysis\nWhitepaper\n\nPublished: July 2016\n\n\n###### CONTENTS Summary .......................................................2 Intelligence....................................................3\nAttack overview ......................................................3\nInfection vector...................................................3\nTarget details.......................................................3\nTimeline..................................................................4\nAttribution & links...................................................5\nConsequences ........................................................5\n###### Technical analysis...........................................6\nInfection sequence.................................................6\nObfuscation............................................................9\nNetwork traffic........................................................9\nOther notes.............................................................10\n###### Sources..........................................................12 Appendix A | Samples.....................................13 Appendix B | IOCS..........................................14\n\n\n-----\n\n#### INTELLIGENCE\n\n##### ATTACK OVERVIEW\n\n###### Infection vector\nThe threat actor uses spearphishing email messages to\ndeliver the malware to their targets, with the text contents\nof the emails carefully crafted (or ‘socially engineered’)\nto the recipients. For example, the content of the email\nmessages used to target the law firm included text related\nto salary or financial matters (Image 1).\n\nThe care displayed in crafting the contents of the\nspearphishing emails indicates the level of effort made by\nthe threat actor to convince recipients that the emails were\nlegitimate.\n\n###### Target details\nThe common denominator among the targets selected\nis that they have some relation to the territorial dispute\nrevolving around the South China Sea.\n\nTargets included the Department of Justice of the\nPhilippines, the organizers of the Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation (APEC) Summit and an international law firm\nrepresenting one of the involved parties.\n\n###### Philippines Department of Justice\nThe Department of Justice of the Philippines has been\ninvolved in the arbitration case filed by that country against\nChina[[2]].\n\n###### APEC organizers\nA sample we recently encountered used a theme related\nto the Economic Leader’s Meeting (AELM), an event tied\nto the APEC Summit that was held in the Philippines in\nNovember 2015[[3]]. In the leadup to the event,news reports\nhad indicated that the South China Sea dispute was\nexpected to be tabled and addressed by the ministers[[4,5]].\n\n###### Major international law firm\nThis major international law firm represents nation states in\narbitration cases involving the United Nations Convention\non the Law of the Sea. Since 2013, this firm has been\nrepresenting one of the parties in its dispute[[6]].\n\nPrior to publication, we made an attempt to reach out to\nthe organizations that we identified as targets and notified\nthem of this threat. Per request, some details have been\nwithheld from inclusion in this public report.\n\n\n**IMAGE 1: SPEAR FISHING EMAIL**\n**TARGETING LAW FIRM EMPLOYEES**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### TIMELINE\n\nMultiple NanHaiShu samples were discovered over the\ncourse of the investigation. Of the samples collected, a\nparticular subset was tasked with gathering intelligence\nrelated to the South China Sea arbitration case.\n\nDistribution of this subset of samples started from January\n13[th] 2015. The file “DOJ Staff bonus January 13, 2015.\nxls” was seen just a month after the Permanent Court\nof Arbitration posted a third press release about the\narbitration case between the two countries[[7]].\n\nThe press release announced that the Philippines\n(represented by the law firm) had until March 15[th] 2015\nto submit supplemental arguments on their case, while\nChina had until June 16[th] 2015 to provide a response to the\nsubmission.\n\nTwo attacks happened between the two aforementioned\ndeadlines:\n\nyy After the Philippines’ deadline, a document file\nwith a filename that referenced the company\nname was sent to the law firm.\nyy Another file that also targeted the lawyers used\nthe name “Salary and Bonus Data.xls” and was\nreleased on May 22[th] 2015, or barely a month\nbefore China’s deadline.\n\nWe saw another sample of this threat also being\ndistributed using a file named “AELM Entertainment\nbudget and Attendance allowance.xls”.\n\nThis file was seen in the wild on October 2[nd] 2015, more\nthan a month prior to the actual event in the Philippines.\nThe event was attended by, among others, Chinese\nPresident Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama; one\nof the main topics that was expected to be tabled during\nthe event was the South China Sea dispute[[4,5]].\n\nOn October 26[th] 2015, there were multiple news reports\nabout the movement of US military ships in the South\nChina Sea[[8,9]]. In the exact same time frame, there was\na notable change in the C&C servers contacted by the\nmalware (see Attribution & Links section).\n\n\n###### TIMELINE OF NANHAISHU  MALWARE DISCOVERY\n\n**November 2015**\nAPEC Summit takes\nplace in the Philippines\n\n\n**October 2015**\nSamples seen in the wild\nC&C servers switch IP address\n\n**October 2015**\nNews on US ship\nmovements\n\n**June 16 2015**\nDeadline for China\nto submit response\n\n**May 2015**\nSamples seen in the wild\n\nSalary and\nBonus Data.xls\n\n\nAELM\nEntertainment\nbudget and\nAttendance\nallowance.xls\n\n\n**March 2015**\nSamples seen in the wild\n\n\nThe draft Foley Hoag reform\nof the distribution of shares\nand remuneration system.xls\n\n\n**March 15 2015**\nDeadline for Philippines to\nsubmit supplemental arguments\n\n\n**January 2015**\nSample seen in the wild\n\nDOJ Staff bonus\nJanuary 13, 2015.xls\n\n\n-----\n\n**IMAGE 2: VARIABLE NAMES ATTRIBUTION**\n\nSearch results for the variable names in\nNanHaiShu’s base64 decoder function\n\n**IMAGE 3: CODE COMPARISON**\n\nNanHaiShu’s VBA base64 decoder (top) vs.\npublicly available JavaScript base64 decoder (bottom)\n\n\n##### ATTRIBUTION & LINKS\n\nThe malware’s VBA base64 decoder function seems to\nbe popular among Chinese programmers - searching for\nthe variable names on the Internet leads to a handful of\nChinese websites (Image 2).\n\nThe variables initialization used by the VBA malware script\nappears to be a forked version of the Javascript base64\ndecoder. This latter code was publicly available in a blog\npost from the Chinese Software Developer Network\n(CSDN) website (Image 3), as early as 2005.\n\nNanHaiShu samples initially had most of their C&C\nservers resolve to IP addresses hosted in the United States\n(specifically, to cloud computing service providers).\nOn October 26[th] 2015 however, all of the malware’s C&C\nservers pointed to the IP address 103.238.224.218 (Image\n4), an IP hosted from a Chinese AS, coinciding with news\nreports of US ship movements in the South China Sea [[8,9]].\n\nOur technical analysis indicates a notable orientation\ntowards code and infrastructure associated with\ndevelopers in mainland China. In addition, we also\nconsider it significant that the selection of organizations\ntargeted for infiltration are directly relevant to topics that\nare considered to be of strategic national interest to the\nChinese government. Based on these points, we believe\nthat the threat actor is of Chinese origin.\n\n##### CONSEQUENCES\n\nNanHaiShu is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and thus\nis able to send system information from an infected\nmachine to a remote C&C server. It is capable of receiving\nand executing additional JScript and VBScript code. The\nRAT can also download any file the attacker pleases.\nThe downloaded files or scripts may then be used for\nexfiltration of data that is likely to be highly sensitive,\ngiven the profile of its targets.\n\n**IMAGE 4: C&C SERVERS**\n\n\nSearch results for the variable names in\nNanHaiShu’s base64 decoder function\n\n**IMAGE 3: CODE COMPARISON**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### TECHNICAL ANALYSIS\n\n##### INFECTION SEQUENCE\n\nNanHaiShu arrives via a spearphishing email message with a file attachment. The emails are sent out from free email\nservice providers and as with most such messages, use socially engineered text content to entice the user into opening\nthe attachment. The file is usually an XLS, but may also be a DOC file. Regardless of format, the attached document\ncontains a malicious macro.\n\nIn most major business environments today, the ability to run macros is disabled by default in the security settings for\nMicrosoft Office programs. If this setting has been modified however, or if the individual user is permitted to enable\nmacros, it is still possible for macro code to be launched.\n\nOffice will display a notification message before the macro code can be executed:\n\n**IMAGE 5: MACRO SECURITY WARNING**\n\nThe user must actively enable the macros in the document for the attack to continue. If the user unwittingly does so, the\nVBA macro decodes and runs.\n\n**IMAGE 6: VBA MACRO DECODES AND EXECUTES THE JSCRIPT**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn most of the samples, two sets of Base64 encoded files are embedded in the VBA macro. For the recent sample, the VBA\nmacro will decode and first write JScript data to “%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Network\\network.js”, then execute it.\n\n**IMAGE 7: VBA MACRO DECODES & OPENS DECOY XLS FILE**\n\nThe macro then decodes a decoy XLS file, which it saves to the current directory using the same filename as the malicious\nXLS. The decoy is then loaded. Finally, the macro creates a VBScript file that will delete the original file.\n\nMeanwhile, the network.js modifies the %regrun% registry to point to itself as its autostart mechanism.\n\nThe code will proceed to retrieve the following system information (Image 8, next page) and upload it to the C&C server:\n\n1.  Volume Serial Number\n2.  IP Address\n3.  Computer Name\n4.  User Name\n5.  Operating System\n6.  Proxy Server\n\nAfterwards, it waits for instructions from the server for a maximum interval of 10.584 seconds (or 6 * 0x6e4 ms).\n\n\n-----\n\n**IMAGE 8: INFORMATION GATHERING ROUTINE**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### OBFUSCATION\n\nThe VBA macro uses base64 encoding to embed the decoy XLS and JScript file. For the recent sample, the URL string used\ninside the JScript code was obfuscated in two layers; it had to be decoded using base64, then decrypted using a routine\nthat extracts and converts a Unicode number to a character.\n\n**IMAGE 9: ADDITIONAL OBFUSCATION ON TOP OF BASE64 ENCODING**\n\n##### NETWORK TRAFFIC\n\nThe attackers utilize dynamic DNS providers for their C&C server; the server that the malware contacts is already included\nthe malicious JScript code. For the most recent sample, the communication between the malware and C&C server uses\nthis data structure before encoding:\n\n\nmd5(Volume Serial Number) | IP Address | Computer Name | User Name | Operating System | Proxy Server | Malware Version |\n\n\nBelow is the POST data example from an infected VM image:\n\n\naction=aaa&data=N2RkZjMyZTE3YTZhYzVjZTA0YThlY2JmNzgyY2E1MDl8MTkyLjE2OC4xLjF8Sm9obkRvZS1QQ3xKb2huRG\n9lLVBDXEpvaG5Eb2UoYWRtaW5pc3RyYXRvcil8TWljcm9zb2Z0IFdpbmRvd3MgWFAgUHJvZmVzc2lvbmFsfHxqc25lWzEuNF\n0saW1wdCxwcnw=\n\n\nThe malware uses HTTP POST to upload the encoded system information and uses HTTP GET to download and execute\nJScript and VBScript code.\n\n**IMAGE 10: THE FUNCTION THAT UPLOAD DATA, DOWNLOAD FILES AND EXECUTE SCRIPTS**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### OTHER NOTES\n\nThe JScript contains a constant variable named “gVersion”. The variable seems to be the malware name/version used by\nthe threat actor to identify the source of data.\n\nThe variable “gVersion” contained variations of the following strings:\n\n1.  hta[1.1]doj.m\n2.  jsne[1.3.3]PP\n3.  jsne[1.4],impt,pr\n\n**IMAGE 11: GVERSION VARIABLE**\n\nThe gVersion of the recent JScript is “jsne[1.4],impt,pr”.\n\nThe HTA file dropped by the “DOJ Staff bonus January 13, 2015.xls” sample has the same JScript routines that exists in later\nsamples, but they are encapsulated inside an HTML format. The file is loaded using the MSHTA.EXE program, which opens\nup the Internet Explorer. Compared with HTML, the HTA has more privileges that can create, edit and remove files and\nregistry entries[[10]].\n\n**IMAGE 12: HTML TAGS ENCAPSULATING THE MALWARE CODE**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first SCRIPT tag moves the IE window outside the viewable area and hides it using the resizeTo command. The second\nSCRIPT tag contains the JScript routine that are common among NanHaiShu samples.\n\nThe only difference between the HTA and the JScript files is that the C&C is not encrypted and it contains the SafeIE\nfunction, which modifies the “Internet Settings” and “Internet Explorer” registries to avoid any prompt related to running\nunsafe ActiveX.\n\n**IMAGE 13: SAFEIE FUNCTION USED TO PREVENT ANY ACTIVEX PROMPT**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### SOURCES\n\n[1] Washington Post; Beijing’s claims to South China Sea rejected by international tribunal?; published 12 July 2016;\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/beijing-remains-angry-defiant-and-defensive-as-key-south-chinasea-tribunal-ruling-looms/2016/07/12/11100f48-4771-11e6-8dac-0c6e4accc5b1_story.html\n\n[2] CNN Philippines; De Lima on The Hague hearings: The world is watching; published July 15 2015;\n\nhttp://cnnphilippines.com/news/2015/07/15/de-lima-doj-rest-of-the-world-watching-the-hague-hearings.html\n\n[3] APEC2015; Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit 2015 Economic Leader’s Meeting (AELM);\n\nhttp://apec2015.ph/meetings/aelm/\n\n[4] Reuters; Obama puts South China Sea dispute on agenda as summitry begins; published 17 Nov 2015;\n\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-apec-summit-idUSKCN0T60RM20151117\n\n[5] Wall Street Journal; Obama Sets Tone for APEC Forum With Focus on South China Sea; published 17 Nov 2015;\n\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-sets-tone-for-apec-forum-with-focus-on-south-china-sea-1447761193\n\n[6] GMA News Online; PROFILES: Can these foreign lawyers help PHL win its arbitration case vs. China?; published July 17\n2015; http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/523278/news/nation/profiles-can-these-foreign-lawyers-helpphl-win-its-arbitration-case-vs-china\n\n[7] Permanent Court of Arbitration; Press Release: Arbitration between the Republic of the Philippines and the People’s\n[Republic of China; published 17 December 2014; http://www.pca-cpa.org/PH-CN_20141217_Press_Release_](http://www.pca-cpa.org/PH-CN_20141217_Press_Release_No_3%20%28ENG%29dac6.pdf?fil_id=2846)\n[No_3%20%28ENG%29dac6.pdf?fil_id=2846](http://www.pca-cpa.org/PH-CN_20141217_Press_Release_No_3%20%28ENG%29dac6.pdf?fil_id=2846)\n\n[8] Reuters; U.S. Navy destroyer nears islands built by China in South China Sea; published 26 Oct 2015;\n\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-usa-idUSKCN0SK2AC20151026\n\n[9] The Guardian; US navy to send destroyer in serious challenge to China territorial claims; published 26 Oct 2015;\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/26/us-navy-destroyer-chinese-islands-south-china-sea\n\n[10] Wikipedia; HTML Application; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Application\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Appendix A | SAMPLES\n\n###### Table 1.
