The attackers gained access to Citrix through several\ncompromised employee accounts, he said.\n\n\"So it's a pretty deep intrusion, with multiple employee compromises and remote access to\ninternal resources,\" he said.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile there is no evidence the attacks directly penetrated U.S. government networks, the\nbreach carries a potential risk that the hackers could eventually find their way into sensitive\ngovernment networks, experts said.\n\nCitrix issued a statement Friday saying the FBI had informed the company Wednesday that it\nhad come under attack from \"international cybercriminals\" and that it was taking action \"to\ncontain this incident.\"\n\n\"While our investigation is ongoing, based on what we know to date, it appears that the\nhackers may have accessed and downloaded business documents,\" it said.\n\n\"At this time, there is no indication that the security of any Citrix product or service was\ncompromised.\"\n\nThe company did not specify over what time period it had come under the cyberattack, how\nmany employee accounts may have been compromised or other details. Citrix's statement\ncame in response to an NBC News request for comment late Thursday.\n\n\"Citrix deeply regrets the impact this incident may have on affected customers,\" it said.\n\nThe FBI declined comment.\n\nResecurity informed Citrix executives of the first cyberattack in a Dec. 28 email, Yoo said.\n\nAn analysis of the cyberattack indicated the hackers were focused in particular on FBIrelated projects, NASA and aerospace contracts and work with Saudi Aramco, Saudi\nArabia's state oil company, according to Yoo.\n\nYoo said his firm, which has been tracking the Iranian-linked group for years, has reason to\nbelieve that Iridium broke its way into Citrix's network about 10 years ago, and has been\nlurking inside the company's system ever since.\n\n\"Once an attacker goes into an environment and compromises one account, that's just the\nfirst stage. And what we uncovered and through our own analysis is a very sophisticated\ncampaign,\" he said.\n\nCitrix sells workplace software to government agencies and corporations around the world\nthat allow employees to work remotely from their own desktops or mobile devices off a\ncentralized data center.\n\nSuzanne Spaulding, a former senior official at the Department of Homeland Security, said\nhacking government contractors provides a potential attack pathway into U.S. government\nfiles. She cited the 2015 cyber attack on the federal Office of Personnel Management in\nwhich private records on millions of individuals were compromised.\n\n\n-----\n\nGovernment contractors often hold sensitive information. Remember that the OPM breach\nincluded breaches of contractors who were conducting background investigations for OPM\nand were holding very sensitive information about individuals seeking or holding clearances,”\nshe said.\n\nIn the case of Citrix, even if the hack did not gain access to company operations, it’s possible\nthat adversaries could gain insights into the company’s network configuration and the\ndefenses of the government agencies, Spaulding said. And that would make hacking those\ngovernment agencies easier, she said.\n\nThe breach of Citrix's computer network gave the hackers access to private communication\nwith government agencies about various sensitive information technology projects involving\nthe FBI, the Missile Defense Agency, the Defense Logistics Agency, the White House\ncommunications agency, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and others, Yoo\nsaid.\n\nDISA provides technical and communications support to the president, the vice president,\nthe secretary of defense and top commanders. The White House communications agency is\nassigned the task of providing secure communications for the president and is manned by\nU.S. military personnel.\n\nIridium targeted Citrix to get at the company’s government clients, Resecurity experts said.\n\"It's an ideal scenario to attack customers in various verticals including the government and\nmilitary,\" Yoo said.\n\nThe goal is to hack into sensitive U.S. government systems, he said. \"We do believe that\nthey are being targeted.\"\n\nResecurity says the Iranian-backed Iridium is the same group that stole personal data on\n[Australian lawmakers and attacked the British Parliament in 2017, as NBC News reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/iran-backed-hackers-hit-both-uk-australian-parliaments-says-report-n977651)\npreviously.\n\nLast month, federal prosecutors charged former U.S. Air Force counterintelligence agent\n[Monica Elfriede Witt with espionage on behalf of Iran. Prosecutors said Witt had access to](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-us-counterintelligence-agent-charged-espionage-behalf-iran-four-iranians-charged-cyber)\nhighly classified information in her work in counterintelligence and defected to Iran in 2013.\nU.S. authorities also charged four Iranians — Behzad Mesri, Mojtaba Masoumpour, Hossein\nParva and Mohamad Paryar — with allegedly using information she had provided to help\nthem target her former colleagues and conduct other cyberespionage.\n\nResecurity experts also said an Iranian-linked group with ties to Iridium was suspected in an\nattempted hack into Israel's missile alert system more than a year ago.\n\nIsrael Defense Forces’ cyberdefense division successfully repelled the cyberassault on the\nsystem, which provides early warning for incoming rockets and missiles, an IDF commander\n[told Israel Hayom’s weekend magazine.](https://www.breakingisraelnews.com/121663/idf-iranian-missile-alert-hack/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Courtney Kube](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/courtney-kube-ncpn3621)\nCourtney Kube is a correspondent covering national security and the military for the NBC\nNews Investigative Unit.\n\n\n-----",
