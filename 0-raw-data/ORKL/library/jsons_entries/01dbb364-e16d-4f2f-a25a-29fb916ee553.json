Find out\nwhy you should partner with eSentire, the Authority in Managed Detection and Response,\ntoday.\n\n[Learn more](https://www.esentire.com/partners)\n\nby Joe Stewart and Keegan Keplinger,\n\nSecurity Researchers with eSentire‘s Threat Response Unit (TRU)\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nFor the past 16 months, eSentire’s security research team, the Threat Response Unit (TRU),\nhas been tracking one of the most capable and stealthy malware suites — Golden Chickens.\nGolden Chickens is the “cyber weapon of choice” for three of the top money making, longestrunning Internet crime groups: Russia-based FIN6 and Cobalt Group and Belarus-based\nEvilnum. The three criminal operations are estimated to have collectively caused financial\nlosses over USD $1.5 billion. This report unveils the identity of the threat actor behind\nGolden Chickens—who goes by badbullzvenom—and outlines how he was found.\n\n### Key Findings\n\nWho is badbullzvenom? Reading through the history of the threat actor’s posts on the\nRussian-language hacker forum, Exploit.in, TRU found multiple mentions of the\nbadbullzvenom account being shared between two people. From the posts, we learn the\nfollowing about badbullzvenom:\n\nThey claim to be from Moldova\nThey speak Romanian, French, and English\nThey claim to work with Russia-based Cobalt Gang (this is also evident in public\nanalysis of Golden Chickens campaign IOCs)\n\n### Who is “Frapstar” and what is his connection to badbullzvenom?\n\n\n-----\n\nNumerous other data points in the report connect a second threat actor, who goes by\n“Frapstar” and the username badbullzvenom. He self-identifies as “Chuck from Montreal” –\nan alias. In addition to speaking French and having a keen interest in buying stolen\nCanadian credit card accounts, he says he owns a BMW 5 Series automobile, which\nprovides TRU with further leads into the identity of “Chuck”.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTRU has discovered “Chuck’s” real name, pictures of him, his home address, the names of\nhis parents, siblings, and friends; his social media accounts, his hobbies, and that he owns a\nsmall business, which he runs out of his home.\n\n“Chuck”, who uses multiple aliases for his underground forum, social media, and Jabber\naccounts, and the threat actor claiming to be from Moldova, have gone to great lengths to\ndisguise themselves. They have also taken great pains to obfuscate the Golden Chickens\nmalware, trying to make it undetectable by most AV companies, and limiting customers to\nusing Golden Chickens for ONLY targeted attacks. Because of eSentire’s investigation,\n“Chuck” has lost his anonymity. TRU also continues to track improvements in the Golden\nChickens source code and discover new Golden Chickens attack campaigns, as recent as\nJuly, which tells us at least one threat actor is still actively developing the product and selling\nit to other cybercriminals. We expect to see further targeted attacks, leveraging this malware,\nbeing launched against financial institutions and other organizations in the foreseeable\nfuture.\n\n## Introduction\n\n[eSentire\nis a leading global provider of Managed Detection and Response security services.](https://www.esentire.com/)\n[For the past 16 months, our security research team, the Threat Response Unit (TRU), has](https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/esentire-threat-response-unit-tactical-threat-response)\nbeen tracking, analyzing, and defending our customers from one of the most capable and\nstealthy malware suites on the Cyber Underground – Golden Chickens. Golden Chickens is\nthe “cyber weapon of choice” for three of the top money making and longest-running Internet\ncrime groups: Russia-based FIN6 and Cobalt Group and Belarus-based Evilnum. The three\ncybercrime operations are estimated to have collectively caused financial losses over USD\n$1.5 billion.\n\nSince 2018, the Golden Chickens suite has been distributed as a Malware-as-a-Service\n(MaaS). Between April 2021 and April 2022, TRU discovered two significant hacking\ncampaigns utilizing Golden Chickens. During the April 2021 incidents, TRU found corporate\n[employees on LinkedIn being targeted by threat actors using fake job offers. One year later](https://www.esentire.com/security-advisories/hackers-spearphish-professionals-on-linkedin-with-fake-job-offers-infecting-them-with-malware-warns-esentire)\nthe April 2022 campaign uncovered by TRU demonstrated that the attack tactics were\n[reversed, and corporate hiring managers were sent fake resumes, of job applicants, laden](https://www.esentire.com/blog/hackers-spearphish-corporate-hiring-managers-with-poisoned-resumes-infecting-them-with-the-more-eggs-malware)\nwith malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nTRU continues to track the Golden Chickens malware, and not only have we detected a new\nthreat campaign that appears to be targeting e-Commerce organizations, we have also\ndiscovered the identity of the threat actor/operator behind Golden Chickens. He is referred to\n[by CrowdStrike researchers as VENOM SPIDER, and he has been connected to the threat](https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2020CrowdStrikeGlobalThreatReport.pdf)\nactor “badbullzvenom”.\n\nTRU has tracked many of badbullzvenom‘s Internet activities, going back as far as 2013. We\nhave also discovered badbullzvenom‘s birthdate, home address, his parents and siblings‘\nnames, friends‘ names, his hobbies, his social media accounts, and one of his side\nbusinesses.\n\nIt is rare to uncover this level of detail about a threat operator, and it illustrates the breadth\nand expertise of TRU. This intelligence, including many of the Underground Forum\nconversations badbullzvenom has had with other threat actors, has been extremely valuable.\nIt has helped us better decipher his Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), as well as\nthe origins of the Golden Chickens MaaS and its ongoing operations. With this knowledge,\nwe continue to hone our defenses, protecting eSentire’s global customer base from wellorchestrated attacks utilizing the Golden Chickens MaaS.\n\nIt is our objective with this report to share our research with other organizations and their\nsecurity teams so that they might better defend their critical data and applications from threat\nactors mounting attack campaigns using the Golden Chickens malware suite. The balance of\nthis report includes:\n\nA brief overview of the FIN6, Cobalt Group and Evilnum cybercrime organizations\nA detailed account of the investigation and subsequent identification of the Golden\nChickens MaaS operator\nAn analysis of the Golden Chickens malware and the current attack campaign\nInsights and security recommendations from TRU\n\n### Golden Chickens‘ Connection to the Billion Dollar Hackers’ Club—FIN6, Cobalt Group and Evilnum\n\nFor those not familiar with FIN6, Cobalt Group and Evilnum, they are hands down three of\nthe longest-running and successful financial crime gangs, and it is reported that cumulatively\nthey have caused over USD $1.5 billion in losses.\n\n**FIN6**\n\nThis Russia-based, financial cybercrime group is known as one of the most notorious\n[hacking gangs in the world of cybercrime. They dominated news headlines in 2018 when](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/19/j/fin6-compromised-e-commerce-platform-via-magecart-to-inject-credit-card-skimmers-into-thousands-of-online-shops.html)\nthey were cited as being the cyber gang who broke into the online payment systems of\nBritish Airways, Ticketmaster UK and top electronic retailer, Newegg, stealing credit and\ndebit card data from millions of customers, as well as stealing Personal Identifiable\n\n\n-----\n\nInformation (PII) from British Airways customers and staff. [British Airways concluded that](https://www.cyberscoop.com/british-airways-additional-customers-identified-magecart-breach/)\nduring their cyber heist, the hackers siphoned off credit and debit card data (also referred to\nas card-skimming),and personal data from 425,000 of their customers and staff. As a result,\nBritish Airways was slapped with a £20 million (USD $26 million) fine from the Information\nCommissioner’s Office (ICO), a UK government watchdog group. The ICO determined that\nBritish Airways did not take the right precautions in protecting the sensitive data of its\ncustomers. However, the ICO fine was not the end of the damage caused by the FIN6\nbreach of British Airways. On [July 5, 2021, British Airways settled a legal claim made by a](https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/28326-british-airways-data-breach-compensation)\ngroup of the airline’s customers and staff, whose data had been leaked during the breach.\nThe settlement was kept confidential, and the airline agreed to pay compensation for\nqualifying claimants but did not admit liability, according to news sources.\n\nThe number of customers affected by the [Ticketmaster UK breach, at the hands of FIN6,](https://threatpost.com/ticketmaster-fine-2018-data-breach/161198/)\nnumbered in the millions. In fact, security experts estimate that the 2018 attack impacted 9.4\nmillion customers. The UK ICO determined that the breach led directly to widespread fraud.\nAs such, they levied a fine of £1.25 million on the ticket agency stating that the corporation\n“failed to put appropriate security measures in place to prevent a cyber-attack on a chat-bot\ninstalled on its online payment page” – and this violated the E.U.’s General Data Protection\nRegulations (GDPR).\n\n[And while top online electronics retailer Newegg couldn’t specify just how many of their](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/magecart-newegg/)\ncustomers’ credit and debit cards were stolen, security reports found that the threat actors\nwere inside Newegg’s IT network for a month before being detected, giving the\ncyberattackers a full 30 days to skim many of Newegg’s customers. Newegg is estimated to\nreceive over 50 million visitors a month, according to Similarweb, a firm which collects\ninformation on site visits.\n\nConservatively, security firm FireEye estimates that between 2016 and 2019, FIN6 is\nbelieved to have stolen 20 million payment cards worth $400 million. The FIN6 gang first\ngained notoriety in 2014 for their attacks against point-of-sale (POS) machines in retail\noutlets and hospitality companies, but as proven by their attacks against British Airways,\nTicketmaster UK and Newegg in 2018, they wholeheartedly moved on to target online\npayment systems of large e-Commerce companies.\n\n**FIN6 attacks e-Commerce companies’ payment platforms with Golden Chickens in late**\n**2018 & retail, entertainment and pharma companies’ payment portals attacked by**\n**Golden Chickens in early 2019.**\n\n[Interestingly, intelligence analysts with Visa reported that at the end of 2018, FIN6 was](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/support-legal/documents/fin6-cybercrime-group-expands-threat-To-ecommerce-merchants.pdf)\nspecifically targeting numerous e-Commerce companies’ payment servers and using\nmalicious documents to infect their targets with the more_eggs component of the Golden\nChickens malware, as the initial phase of their attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nThat activity mirrors another threat campaign that was reported separately in February 2019\nby [ProofPoint researchers. In these incidents, threat actors were observed attacking retail,](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/fake-jobs-campaigns-delivering-moreeggs-backdoor-fake-job-offers)\nentertainment and pharmaceutical companies’ online payments systems\nand using\nmalicious documents, laden with the more_eggs component of Golden Chickens, to target\nthe companies’ employees. The threat actors sent fake job offers to the employees, cleverly\nusing the job title listed on their LinkedIn profiles in their communications. Could FIN6 be\nbehind this Golden Chickens attack campaign?\n\nLater in August 2019, the FIN6 operators launched another malicious campaign, and\nresearchers believe FIN6 was actively going after multinational organizations. Like the\nFebruary 2019 campaign, employees were spear phished with fake job offers. According to\nresearchers, the threat actors began by targeting handpicked employees using LinkedIn\nmessaging and email.\n\nBetween the end of 2018 and April 2021, there have been three distinct Golden\n**Chickens/more_eggs LinkedIn campaigns using the same modus operandi (MO). Each**\ncampaign targeted corporate employees, utilized their LinkedIn profile, and then social\nengineered them with bogus job offers, which lead to the more_eggs component of Golden\n**Chickens.**\n\n**Cobalt Group**\n\nAnother Russia-based organized cybercrime gang that has been plaguing financial\n[institutions since at least 2016 and is known to use the Golden Chickens malware suite. The](https://adware.guru/same-people-developed-malware-for-the-evilnum-hack-group-fin6-and-cobalt/)\n[Cobalt Group is reported to have caused the financial industry over a billion dollars in](https://www.makeuseof.com/notorious-cyber-crime-gangs/)\ncumulative losses. Their crime spree includes the targeting of 100 financial institutions in\nmore than 40 countries worldwide, allowing the criminals to steal more than USD $11 million\nper heist.\n\nThe Cobalt Group's typical MO was to infiltrate banking institutions by sending spear\nphishing emails with malicious attachments to bank employees. The Cobalt Group\nrepeatedly used Golden Chickens and its **[more_eggs backdoor in their attacks. Once](https://cyware.com/news/cobalt-group-suspected-of-targeting-financial-institutions-and-businesses-in-new-campaign-b6b0b4a4)**\ndownloaded, the cybercriminals gained access to the infected computer and were able to\naccess the internal banking network. The Cobalt Group was said to have spent months\ninside the infected networks studying the bank’s operations and workflows, including the\nSociety for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) bank system.\n\nThe Cobalt Group also gained notoriety for its “jackpotting“ schemes where they would break\ninto bank servers that controlled the ATMs and manipulate the ATMs to remotely dispense\ncash at a certain time, in predetermined locations, where money mules waited to collect the\ncash.\n\n**Evilnum**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Evilnum group, believed to be out of Belarus, is best known for compromising financial\ntechnology companies and companies that provide stock trading platforms and tools. They\ntarget financial information about the FINTECH companies and their customers, seeking out\nspreadsheets, customer lists, investments, trading operations and credentials for trading\nsoftware platforms. The Evilnum group is also known to spear phish employees of the\ncompanies they are targeting and enclose malicious zip files. If executed, the employees\noften get hit with the more_eggs backdoor, along with other malware.\n\n### Unmasking badbullzvenom—The Threat Actor Behind Golden Chickens\n\n[Quo Intelligence first connected VENOM SPIDER to the threat actor “badbullzvenom”. This](https://quointelligence.eu/2020/07/golden-chickens-evolution-of-the-maas/)\nattribution was made possible due to a dispute on the Exploit.in hacker forum. In the thread,\nprivate conversations are revealed between a Golden Chickens MaaS customer,\nBlackAngus, and the MaaS provider, badbullzvenom. The dispute centered around a sample\nof the malware appearing in VirusTotal, causing the customer to be banned from the service.\nBecause the actual sample in VirusTotal was linked in the thread, researchers were able to\nconfirm the connection to the Golden Chickens MaaS and identify badbullzvenom as the\nMaaS operator.\n\n_Figure 1 - Exploit.in reply to dispute thread. badbullzvenom drops BlackAngus as a customer_\n_for breaking his rules and shuts down his access._\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the entire content of his posts on Exploit.in, we learn the following information about\nbadbullzvenom:\n\nThey claim to be from Moldova\nThey speak Romanian, French, and English\nThey claim to work with Cobalt Gang (this is also evident in public analysis of Golden\nChickens campaign IOCs)\n\n### The Connection between badbullzvenom and “Frapstar”\n\nDigging deeper into Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), TRU studied numerous security\nreports in order to connect the various forum accounts engaged with the Golden Chickens\nMaaS, and we found one published by Trend Micro in 2015 titled: Attack of the Solo\nCybercriminals – Frapstar in Canada, where the threat actor is identified as a lone carder (a\ncriminal who monetizes stolen credit cards) with accounts and multiple aliases (including\nbadbullzvenom) on several hacker forums.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 - Trend Micro Report on Frapstar_\n\nFrom this [report, we learn more key information about the threat actor who goes by Frapstar:](https://blog-trendmicro-co-jp.translate.goog/archives/11529?_x_tr_sl=ja&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc)\n\nThey have a keen interest in obtaining stolen Canadian credit card accounts\nThey own a BMW 5 Series automobile, specifically the E39 540i\nThey use the following usernames on various forums:\n\nBadbullzvenom\nBadbullz\nFrapstar\nKsensei21\nE39_Frap* (i.e., E39_Frapstar)\n\n### Are There Two Threat Actors Behind the Golden Chickens MaaS?\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the report from Trend, we see that user E39_Frap self-identifies as Chuck from\nMontreal”. However, this seems to be at odds with the information from the Exploit.in forum\nwhere the threat actor says he is from Moldova and can write in Romanian, as well as in\nEnglish and French. He even participates in a thread on the Lampeduza forum titled\n“Romanian only”. However, in the earlier thread, we also see where badbullzvenom says he\ncan write in French, which could show a possible connection to Montreal.\n\nIs the threat actor behind the badbullzvenom account from Montreal, Moldova or another\nEastern European country where Romanian is spoken? This remained a mystery until we\nhad the opportunity to read through many of the threat actor’s older forum posts. Here we\nfound mentions on multiple occasions of the badbullzvenom account being shared between\ntwo people. (See Figures 3 and 4).\n\n_Figure 3 - Exploit.in post_\n\n_Figure 4 - Exploit.in post_\n\n\n-----\n\nTRU believes that Chuck is just one threat actor that operates the badbullzvenom account\nat times, and is in fact located in Montreal, Canada. We also believe there is a second threat\nactor, possibly from Moldova or Romania, that operates the badbullzvenom account\nalongside “Chuck.”\n\n### Timeline of badbullzvenom’s Progression from Script Kiddie to MaaS Provider\n\nBadbullzvenom’s activity on Exploit.in, over the years, demonstrates a progression from a\n“script kiddie” to a MaaS provider:\n\nFigure 5: Progression from ScriptKiddie to MaaS Provider\n\n**2013 – badbullzvenom first recorded posts on the forum that are often complaints about**\nother users. He demonstrates an interest in Canadian computer traffic and Canadian banks\nsuch as TD, CIBC, Scotiabank, and BMO.\n\n**2014 – Throughout the majority of 2014, badbullzvenom only posts three times in Exploit.in.**\n\n**2015 – badbullzvenom returns from his hiatus, but he tends to demonstrate more confidence**\nand technical acumen. He points other members to appropriate tools of the hacking trade,\nparticipates in banter, shows an interest in banking trojans for sale, and starts giving more\npositive reviews.\n\n**2016 – After another hiatus, badbullzvenom returns once again, offering for sale his first**\ncyber tool. He only nets two customers and in this time, he continues to show interest in\nbanking trojans and cryptors, as well as a continued interest in financial data relating to\nCanada. He also makes aggressive and offensive comments, including one statement he\nmakes before going on hiatus again, where he tells one member of Exploit.in to kill\nthemselves, and he offers to pay for the bullet.\n\n**2017-2019 – badbullzvenom returns to the forum once more, offering the sale of “Word 1-day**\ndoc builder” – known today as VenomKit. It is a malicious document builder that takes\nadvantage of Windows Office exploits. He accumulates customers quickly and continues to\n\n\n-----\n\ndevelop the builder, adding new exploits as they appear and updating its features. For\nexample, PowerShell is removed from the attack chain to reduce detection, .dll support is\nadded for payloads, and a .js downloader (likely the more_eggs backdoor component of\n[Golden Chickens is added and is for sale.) During this timeframe, Cobalt Group is reported](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/a-hacking-group-is-already-exploiting-the-office-equation-editor-bug/)\nas using badbullzvenom’s builder to deploy Cobalt Strike in attacks on banks – then again in\n2018. In 2019, [FIN6 is observed using more_eggs with employment lures.](https://threatpost.com/fin6-target-ecommerce/147847/)\n\n### Picking Up the Trail\n\nIn recent years, database leaks have exposed billions of users’ credentials, leading to\nhacking and privacy concerns. However, one aspect of this activity works in favor of network\ndefenders – the fact that numerous hacking forums have had their user databases leaked,\noffering an opportunity to make connections between online personas of known threat actors\nand their real-world identities.\n\nReferencing the 2015 Trend Micro report, we confirmed the threat actor had accounts in\nthree underground forums. These forums were later breached, and the user databases\nleaked, revealing email addresses used by the threat actor in the past:\n\nCarder.pro\n\n[frapstar:[email protected]](https://www.esentire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\nOpensc.ws\n\n[ksensei:[email protected]](https://www.esentire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\nCarder.su\n\n[frapstar:[email protected]](https://www.esentire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\n[Other database leaks revealed an account using the [email protected] email address with the](https://www.esentire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\npassword “Nay45uck+”. Pivoting on this piece of information leads us to an old Myspace\n[account registered to [email protected] that used the same password. While it is possible](https://www.esentire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\nthere could be two users that coincidentally chose the same rather unique password,\nsearching Google leads us to the account “crazyteg67” on the Montreal Racing forum using\nthat email address, to sell $1000 worth of gift cards for $700.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 - Montreal Racing post_\n\nThis account seems to be shared by multiple people, as there are frequent posts offering\nitems for sale with different contact phone numbers and first names in the offer. One of the\ncontact names is “Chuck”.\n\n_Figure 7 - crazyteg67 selling an XBOX 360 as \"chuck\"_\n\nThe crazyteg67 user also owns a BMW 540i according to his own posts:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 - crazyteg67 looking for a 540i clutch replacement_\n\n### The Social Media Trail\n\nPivoting on the “dalion67” username, we find a Pinterest account for “Dee Inconegro”, with a\nfew boards created under it. One of those boards is dedicated to BMW M5 series photos,\nand another is dedicated to photos of English Bull Terriers, and the name of the board is\n“Bad Bullz”.\n\n_Figure 9 - Pinterest profile_\n\nInterestingly, there is a Facebook account using the same fake name “Dee Inconegro”, with\nonly a few posts. However, we can see references to this account in other users’ posts, one\nof which referred to the account by an older name, “Keyser Sensei” (See Figure 11), which\nwe found amusing as it appears to be a reference to the mysterious crime lord character—\nKeyser Söze in the movie, Usual Suspects.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10 - Dee Inconegro Facebook_\n\n_profile_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 - Facebook post linking to Dee Inconegro profile_\nAdditionally, this account is linked through multiple friends to another account with the name\n“Chuck Larock”, which appears to be an older account of the same actor, where he shared\nphotos of his English Bull Terriers. However, this name is also an alias, not the real name of\nthe threat actor.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12 - Chuck Larock Facebook profile_\n\nEven though the threat actor is careful to never use his real name when creating social\nmedia or forum accounts, a comment from one of “Chuck Larock’s” Facebook friends gives\nus a clue.\n\n_Figure 13 - Facebook comment_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe comment, where a friend says: “yo [name redacted] ca va” which casually means “hey,\nhow are you?” in French. This might easily be overlooked, because the name the friend calls\nout in the comment is not a common name and not meaningful by itself. However, in the\ncontext of Dee Inconegro’s Facebook page, we find another clue. From public records, we\nlearn that Dee Inconegro’s listed employer, [company name redacted.ca], is actually owned\nby a man who goes by [name redacted], a Canadian citizen of Haitian descent.\n\n_Figure 14 - Business registration for [company name redacted]_\n\nIt appears that [company name redacted.ca] is a sole-proprietor business, operated from a\nresidential address in Montreal. One former Google Street View photo shows an image of\nthe location with two BMWs in the driveway and a person (possibly our threat actor) standing\nin front.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15 - Google Street View image of [name redacted.ca] office_\n\nThis name matches another email address posted by the account on the Montreal Racing\nforums, [name redacted]@sympatico.ca.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16 – crazyteg67 asking for photo_\n\nReferences to the number “67” in usernames used by the threat actor and his associates\n[could suggest an affiliation with the Montreal 67s, a Haitian street gang.](https://hiphopdatabase.fandom.com/wiki/67%27s)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17: Background information on the 67’s street gang._\n\n### About the Golden Chickens Malware Suite—a Modular Malware\n\nGolden Chickens is a stealthy, highly functional, all-in-one suite of malware. It consists of\nvarious components that threat actors can select for their objectives:\n\n**More_eggs – This is the Golden Chickens‘ key component. More_eggs provides threat**\nactors with a back door and a malware loader.\n\n**VenomLNK – Initial access for more_eggs. VenomLNK is a .lnk file (Windows shortcut) sent**\nto victims to instigate User Execution.\n\n**TerraLoader – The primary goal of VenomLNK is to instantiate TerraLoader which can then**\nload the individual objective-based plugins.\n\n**TerraRecon – Performs initial environmental analysis of the infected machine and provides**\nthreat actors with some rudimentary information of the organization‘s network.\n\n**TerraStealer – Harvests credentials and emails from browsers, email clients, and transfer**\nutilities.\n\n**TerraTV – Allows threat actors to move laterally in the network by hijacking the**\norganization‘s running instance of TeamViewer.\n\n**TerraPreter – Provides a meterpreter shell that allows threat actors to perform actions such**\nas lateral movement, discovery, and credential theft manually.\n\n**TerraCrypt – An encryption payload for ransomware extortion attacks.**\n\n\n-----\n\n### TRU Detects a New Golden Chickens Campaign & E-Commerce Companies Appear to Be the Targets\n\nSince the beginning of 2022, TRU has observed several incidents in which VenomLNK, a\n.lnk file (a Windows shortcut) sent to victims to instigate User Execution, was leveraged to\ntarget corporate hiring managers in the U.S. A single sample uploaded to VirusTotal in July\n2022, from France, pointed to a new resume-themed download server, suggesting ongoing\ncyberattacks utilizing Golden Chickens. The associated URL indicates the malware is being\nused to go after e-Commerce companies, which we know is a favorite target of FIN6, the\nfinancial crime group known for successfully compromising large e-Commerce companies\nincluding British Airways, Newegg, Ticketmaster and countless others.\n\nIn order to deliver VenomLNK to victims and ensure that they click on them, the Golden\nChickens operators leverage employee recruitment processes. The threat actors engage\ntargets through services such as LinkedIn, Indeed, and the organization‘s own careers\nsection of their website. In the past, operators started by engaging the victim on LinkedIn,\neventually following up with a job offer through email.\n\nIn the July campaign, VenomLNK is hosted on a personal branding web page (See Figures\n18 and 19). The operators then send a link leading to a mock resume PDF through the\norganization‘s recruitment platform (e.g. Indeed, LinkedIn, or the organization‘s own career\nweb page). The PDF purports to be broken, offering an embedded link (Figure 20) to the\nmalicious VenomLNK file on the branding website, which the victim then downloads and\nexecutes manually after completing a CAPTCHA.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 18: The landing page of the personal branding website hosting VenomLNK_\n\n_Figure19: Personal branding website hosting VenomLNK_\n\n_Figure 20: The only content in the PDF is a fake error message with a link directing the victim_\n_to download VenomLNK_\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing a CAPTCHA on a website makes it harder for security researchers and their tools,\nespecially if those tools are automated, to retrieve and analyze if there is any malware\npresent. Evasion tactics, like this, are a clever way for threat actors trying to get a foothold\ninto an e-Commerce company to increase their chances of success.\n\n### A $200,000 Bounty Issued for badbullzvenom on July 18, 2022\n\nNot only has TRU detected what appears to be a new Golden Chickens attack campaign, but\non July 18, 2022, a threat actor going by “babay” went on to Exploit.in and accused\nbadbullzvenom of stealing $1 million from him. Consequently, babay issued a $200,000\nbounty for any information leading to badbullzvenom’s real identity. See Figure 21.\n\n_Figure 21: A threat actor on Exploit.in accuses badbullzvenom of stealing $1 million from him_\n_and offers a $200,000 bounty for any information leading to badbullzvenom’s real identity_\n\nThe translation of the complaint made on July 18, 2022, by babay about badbullzvenom in\nExploit.in:\n\n\n-----\n\n[[email protected] a.k.a. badbullzvenom](https://www.esentire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\nThe total cost of the complaint $1,000,000.\n\nThe person scammed me, didn't complete his job, talk total nonsense, I can't contact him\nand he refuses to return the money back. The situation is private, I sent the logs to the\nadmin.\n\nFor the information that can lead to his deanonymization I will pay $200,000 through the\nguarantor.”\n\nThe translation of Exploit.in’s Administrator/Moderator’s response to babay:\n\n“I have looked through the logs, the user is deleted from the forum.”\n\n### The Significance of Discovering the Identity of the Golden Chickens Operator\n\n1. The connection to The Billion Dollar Hackers: The Golden Chickens MaaS is a\n\nfavorite cyber weapon of three of the longest-running and successful financial crime\ngangs on the Underground: Russia-based FIN6 and Cobalt Group, and Evilnum, a\nhacker group suspected to operate out of Belarus, a neighbor and ally of Russia. In\nlearning more about the threat actor behind Golden Chickens and understanding his\noperation, TRU can garner more intelligence about the TTPs of the FIN6, Cobalt Group\nand Evilnum operations. This knowledge is invaluable for eSentire and other cyber\ndefenders, as they develop security protections that will detect, respond and shut down\nattacks launched by these threat groups.\n2. Collaboration with Law Enforcement: In 2015, the [Trend Micro report about](https://blog-trendmicro-co-jp.translate.goog/archives/11529?_x_tr_sl=ja&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc)\n\nFrapstar, aka badbullzvenom, provided solid intelligence about this threat actor, giving\nlaw enforcement a real chance of identifying and potentially arresting badbullzvenom\nwhen he was still a minor player on the cybercrime scene. Instead, he has had seven\nyears to hone his skills, and from our findings, we see that he has continued to get\nbetter at developing malware and obfuscating it. Badbullzvenom is very stealthy, and\nhe goes to extremes to keep his malware fully undetectable (FUD) by anti-virus, trying\nto make sure that samples of Golden Chickens are not uploaded to Virus Total.\nBadbullzvenom also insists that his clients ONLY use his malware in very “targeted”\nattacks to further ensure that he and his malicious software fly under the radar.\n\nWe believe the case of the Golden Chickens operator is a stark example of what can\nhappen if a threat actor, who is considered “low hanging fruit,” is ignored by law\nenforcement. All eSentire’s research has been transitioned to law enforcement for\ncriminal investigations.\n\n\n-----\n\n3. Understanding Golden Chickens Malware: Discovering the identity and activities of\n\nthe Golden Chickens operator has enabled Stewart and Keplinger to answer several\nquestions about the malware suite, such as:\n\nWhy do security researchers see so few hacker campaigns involving the Golden\nChickens malware?\nHow long has badbullzvenom been conducting cyber fraud?\nWhat TTPs does badbullzvenom use to avoid detection?\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere is compelling evidence that the threat actor, detailed in this report, is one of possibly\ntwo operators behind the badbullzvenom account on Exploit.in.\n\nInterestingly, as of July 2022, all of badbullzvenom’s posts on Exploit.in have been purged\nfrom the forum. However, TRU continues to see improvements in the Golden Chickens\nsource code and new Golden Chickens attack campaigns, like the one we detected in July.\nThat tells us that the malware suite is still actively being developed and is being and sold to\nother threat actors. We expect to see further targeted attacks against financial institutions\nand organizations, processing large amounts of credit and debit card data, leveraging this\nmalware in the foreseeable future. Thus, TRU is continuing to investigate the Golden\nChickens operation and any other parties that may be involved.\n\nIt is TRU’s recommendation that organizations take the following steps to protect against the\nGolden Chickens malware suite:\n\n1. Employ exhaustive endpoint monitoring for LOLBINs, aka Trusted Windows Binary\n\nabuse. LOLBINs of interest include cmd.exe, wscript.exe, wmic.exe, cmstp.exe,\nmsxsl.exe, powershell.exe, and ie4uinit.exe.Ensure endpoint products have rules in\nplace to detect suspicious usage of these Windows processes.\n2. Ensure employees are aware of common phishing tactics:\n\nBe suspicious of attachments from people you don’t know – additional care is\nrequired in cases where you must accept documents from the public (such as\nwith employee hiring process)\nInspect attachment file types by right clicking the file and selecting properties\nDocuments should never come as LNK, ISO, or VBS files\nOften, these malicious files will be enclosed in a .zip file to bypass email filters\n\n\n-----\n\n3. Have an easy process in place for reporting phishing and suspicious behavior\n\nLeadership is responsible for ensuring a positive and convenient path is in place\nfor reporting suspicious behavior\nDevelop a collaborative culture of cyber resiliency where employees are\ncomfortable to bring forward questions, and even mistakes when it comes to\nemail behavior and downloads. Punishing employees for falling for phishing\nscams will reduce the chances that they – and other employees – report them in\nthe future.\n4. Engage Managed Detection and Response services for 24/7 Security Monitoring,\n\nThreat Hunting and Threat Containment expertise. The speed with which you can\ndetect and contain a threat actor before they achieve their objectives is imperative in\npreventing business disruption.\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Domains**\n\njohnwagen[.]com\n\nmikelatona[.]com\nliamelston[.]com\nmikegarmon[.]com\nrobertbuss[.]com\njohncheston[.]com\njamesstepleton[.]com\njamesreuther[.]com\nwilliamhankins[.]com\n\njamesdabill[.]com\n\n**VenomLNK SHA256**\n\n33e5078833aa2caf7dcbae23300c6a4635076625e79f2368871727e895e76d89\n\n05d9e8a947dbaebb6c3df9889bc2db55f1ba58f18f16a96d105bf9f3438081bb\n\n26fdd198192575716c72f1cc08c6ad0f9828d5bb90225436caf654b95c967ee3\n\nce08dbf119fbe2effdecce7374bb12b2720489a6508bef67f1d297b25fceeadf\n\nc8fe70f61d05b50dd5f9000979f517e2e9a89b6f9d3e8d896af82064de187cb7\n\nc611088c624895be4e347e0d474405a2ddf582af0172867014666d5a78e657dc\n\n7d3bbf055179fb53d7ffcbb0c0a2c07caea64c5bdc5db442d8babba8da398abf\n\nCookies allow us to deliver the best possible experience for you on our website - by\ncontinuing to use our website or by closing this box, you are consenting to our use of\n[cookies.
