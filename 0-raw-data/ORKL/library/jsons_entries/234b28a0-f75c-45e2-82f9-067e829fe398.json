It has also changed the way we engage in conflict with\nothers; this can be seen on a micro level in the emergence of cyber bullying or at the macro\nlevel in the declaration by the U.S. Department of Defense declaring “Cyber” a fifth domain of\nwarfare.\n\nCyber conflict can be an equalizer for adversaries who have limited ability to achieve their\ngoals through other conventional avenues. As an example, take the case of individuals\nsupportive of the Syrian regime; these supporters have little ability to engage in kinetic\nwarfare against Western or anti-regime targets in the physical world, but leveraging cyber\nattacks is well within their capability.\n\nOver the past three months, the adversary designated by CrowdStrike as DEADEYE\nJACKAL (commonly known as the Syrian Electronic Army) carried out a number of attacks\nagainst major media outlets. In mid-August, reports emerged that the adversary successfully\nredirected visitors to the major media websites such as the Washington Post to a DEADEYE\nJACKAL-controlled website; the actor also claimed to have similarly compromised the\nwebsites of CNN and Time. Several weeks later, DEADEYE JACKAL successfully took down\nthe New York Times’ website through a DNS redirection.\n\nIt is interesting to note that these were not direct attacks against the targeted organizations’\nnetworks; they were carried out by compromising the networks of third-party service\nproviders. These third parties were leveraged by the targets to support social media\nmarketing, content publishing, advertising, and domain registration/hosting. Compromising\nthese vendors is a new tactic for DEADEYE JACKAL, who leveraged it as a force multiplier.\nThis tactic negated the necessity of compromising three hard targets, allowing the adversary\nto increase impact dramatically by finding a common link and exploiting it. The attacks by\nDEADEYE JACKAL were clearly motivated by press surrounding the conflict in Syria that\nwas critical of the Syrian regime. This adversary is supportive of the current Syrian regime,\nand it likely desired to control the messaging it felt was driving international anti-regime\nsentiment. In general, these attacks were disruptive and did not target sensitive data of the\nmedia outlets or service providers. These attacks represent the emerging threat of regional\nconflicts spilling over into the cyber domain and damaging or embarrassing entities far\noutside of the conflict zone.\n\nDesire to control messaging about the Syrian regime motivated DEADEYE JACKAL’s\ntargeting of the media; however, they could easily adjust targeting toward more impactful\ntargets. As an example, DEADEYE JACKAL may have similarly decided that Western\n\n\n-----\n\nfinancial institutions would be an effective target to dissuade kinetic involvement of external\nmilitaries. Financial entities in the U.S. have already been victimized by attackers calling\nthemselves the “Cyber fighters of Izz Ad-Din Al Qassam” who purportedly seek retribution for\nan offensive video posted to a popular video sharing site. DEADEYE JACKAL could also turn\nits sights on entities within the defense industrial base, as the weapons produced by those\ncompanies might be used in a strike against Syrian government forces. Organizations in the\noil and gas sector could also be targeted if the adversary views interference in the Syrian\nconflict as a pretext to secure access to oil resources in the region. Whatever the business\nvertical one can come up with, there is a potential reason why an irrational actor motivated\nby self defense might seek to leverage cyber attacks against it.\n\nThe spillover of regional conflict is also demonstrated by the activity of another adversary\ndesignated by CrowdStrike as CORSAIR JACKAL (also known as the Tunisian Cyber Army).\nDuring 2013, this adversary carried out a smaller number of high-profile attacks aimed at\norganizations in the financial, oil and gas, and shipping sectors. Additionally, in March 2013\nthe adversary also made unconfirmed claims that it compromised a large user database from\na financial institution. Although CORSAIR JACKAL’s operations were not as visible as those\nof DEADEYE JACKAL, the adversary represents another instance of malicious cyber activity\nemanating from a tumultuous region directed at organizations that may not have a clear\nconnection to the conflict in that region. In the case of CORSAIR JACKAL, the only\nlegitimacy needed to target Western businesses was anti-Western sentiment from perceived\ninterference by Western governments in theatre.\n\nOrganizations across all sectors must consider the risk of conflict in the physical world\nspilling over into the cyber domain and resulting in malicious actors targeting their systems,\noperations, or customers. The use of cyber attacks is not declining; it is rapidly proliferating.\nAs tools become easier to acquire, use, and modify, new adversaries are stepping on to the\ncyber domain from all over the world every day.\n\nIt is for these reasons that CrowdStrike advocates an intelligence-driven approach to\nsecurity; the CrowdStrike Intelligence team tracks adversaries emanating from geographic\nlocations across the globe and various motivations. This past quarter we identified multiple\nnew adversaries with specific Tactics, Techniques, and Practices (TTPs) and associated\nactionable indicators for our intelligence subscription customers. These new adversaries\ninclude the two nationalistically motivated actors discussed above, DEADEYE JACKAL and\nCORSAIR JACKAL, and a number of others engaged in targeted intrusion operations such\nas STONE PANDA, NIGHTSHADE PANDA, GOBLIN PANDA, and MAGIC KITTEN.\n\n**Learn More about CrowdStrike’s approach to intelligence-driven security.**\n\n**[LISTEN NOW](https://web.archive.org/web/20160315044507/http://www.crowdstrike.com/crowdcasts/index.html)**\n\n**Register for our 10/16 CrowdCast: “You Have an Adversary Problem.
