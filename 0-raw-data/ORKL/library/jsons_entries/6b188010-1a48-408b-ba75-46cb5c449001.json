Many campaigns have originated from this IP since June of 2020 (see Indicators of Compromise). It is a\nheavily modified re-working of the SOVA malware, with different functionality, targets, C2 servers, domains and packing\nschemes.\n\nMaliBot has an extensive array of features:\n\nWeb injection/overlay attacks\nTheft of cryptocurrency wallets (Binance, Trust)\nTheft of MFA/2FA codes\nTheft of cookies\nTheft of SMS messages\nThe ability to by-pass Google two-step authentication\nVNC access to the device and screen capturing\nThe ability to run and delete applications on demand\nThe ability to send SMS messages on demand\nInformation gathering from the device, including its IP, AndroidID, model, language, installed application list, screen\nand locked states, and reporting on the malware’s own capabilities\nExtensive logging of any successful or failed operations, phone activities (calls, SMS) and any errors\n\n[back to top]\n\n## Distributing MaliBot\n\nDistribution of MaliBot is performed by attracting victims to fraudulent websites where they are tricked into downloading the\nmalware, or by directly sending SMS phishing messages (smishing) to mobile phone numbers.\n\n### Websites\n\nThe malware authors have so far created two campaigns– “Mining X” and “TheCryptoApp” – each of which has a website\nwith a download link to the malware (see Campaign Screenshots in the Appendix).\n\n**TheCryptoApp campaign attempts to trick people into downloading their malware instead of the legitimate TheCryptoApp –**\na cryptocurrency tracker app with more than 1 million downloads in the Google Play Store.[1]\n\n\n-----\n\nFor stealth and targeting purposes, the download link will direct the user to the malware APK only if the victim visits the\nwebsite from an Android device, otherwise, the download link will refer to the real TheCryptoApp app in the play store (see\nFigure 1 and Figure 2 ).\n\nFigure 1. Javascript variables used to modify the download URL.\n\nThe Mining X campaign is not based on any actual application in the Google Play store, but instead presents a QR code\nthat leads to the malware APK.\n\n[back to top]\n\n### Smishing\n\nSmishing is commonly used among mobile banker-trojans because it allows the malware to spread in a fast and\ncontrollable way, and in this case, MaliBot is no different. MaliBot can send SMS messages on-demand, and once it\nreceives a “sendsms” command containing a text to send and a phone list from the C2 server, MaliBot sends the SMS to\neach phone number (Figure 3).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. MaliBot code sending smishing messages to targeted phone numbers.\n\nMaliBot’s C2 IP has been used in other malware smishing campaigns since June 2020, which raises questions about how\nthe authors of this malware are related to other campaigns (see Campaign Screenshots).\n\n[back to top]\n\n## How MaliBot Works\n\nAndroid ‘packers’ are becoming increasingly popular with malware developers since they allow native code to be encrypted\nwithin the mobile app making reverse engineering and analysis much more difficult. Using the Tencent packer, MaliBot\nunpacks itself by decrypting an encrypted Dex file from the assets and loading it in runtime using MultiDex. We have a\n[detailed analysis on the Tencent packer in the “Dex decryption” section in our Flubot article. Please note that not all MaliBot](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/flubots-authors-employ-creative-and-sophisticated-techniques-to-achieve-their-goals-in-version-50-and-beyond)\nsamples are packed.\n\nOnce loaded, MaliBot contacts the C2 server to register the infected device, then asks the victim to grant accessibility and\nlauncher permissions. MaliBot then registers four services that perform most of the malicious operations:\n\nBackground Service\n\nPolls for commands from C2\nHandles C2 commands\nSends device and malware information (such as permissions enabled, phone locked, \"VNC\" enabled, etc.)\nSend Keep-Alive pings to C2\nNotify Service\n\nChecks Accessibility permissions, if not granted it sends a notification to enable these permissions and\nnavigates to Settings.\nAccessibility Service\n\nImplementing a VNC-like functionality using the Accessibility API (see below)\nGrabbing information from screen\nPopulate Bus object which saves device’s states\nScreen Capture service\n\nResponsible for capturing the screen, also used as part of the \"VNC\" implementation\n\nFour Receivers are registered as well:\n\nSMS Receiver – interception of SMS messages\nBoot Receiver\nCall Receiver\nAlarm receiver – background service watchdog to intercept calls, register boot activity, and intercept alarms.\n\n\n-----\n\n[back to top]\n\n### Accessibility API Abuse\n\nMaliBot performs most of its malicious operations by abusing Android’s Accessibility API. The Accessibility API is a powerful\ntool developed to encourage Android developers to build apps accessible for users with additional needs. The Accessibility\nAPI allows mobile apps to perform actions on behalf of the user, including the ability to read text from the screen, press\nbuttons and listen for other accessibility events.\n\nHowever, these powerful functions can also allow attackers to steal sensitive information and manipulate the device to their\nadvantage. Flubot, Sharkbot and Teabot are just a few examples of banking trojans other than MaliBot that abuse the\naccessibility API. This service also allows mobile malware to maintain persistence. The malware can protect itself against\nuninstallation and permissions removal by looking for specific text or labels on the screen and pressing the back button to\nprevent them.\n\n[back to top]\n\n### Google’s 2-Step Verification Bypass\n\nStealing credentials is often not enough to allow an attacker to successfully log in to a victim’s account. Since Google\naccounts are often enabled with multifactor authentication (also known as two-factor authentication, or in Google’s case, 2step verification), a prompt will be shown on the victim’s devices if an unknown device tries to log in. The prompt will ask the\nvictim to grant or deny the login attempt, then match a number shown on the other device. Once they have used MaliBot to\ncapture credentials, the attackers can authenticate to Google accounts on the C2 server using those credentials, and use\nMaliBot to extract the MFA codes through the following steps:\n\nFirst, it validates the current screen is a Google promp﻿t screen (Figure 4 & Figure 5).\n\nFigures 4 & 5\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Google MFA prompt of the type MaliBot was designed to circumvent.\n\nFigure 5. MaliBot code detecting Google's MFA prompt.\n\nUsing the Accessibility API, the malware clicks on the \"Yes\" button\nThe attacker logs the MFA code shown on the attacker’s device to the C2.\nThe malware then retrieves the MFA code that was shown on the attacker’s device from the C2 (Figure 6 & Figure 7).\n\nFigures 6 & 7\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Google MFA prompt on the attacker device.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. MaliBot code to retrieve the MFA value.\n\nMaliBot then clicks on the correct button on the screen by matching the buttons’ value against the number retrieved\nfrom the C2 server (Figure 8 and Figure 9).\n\nFigures 8 & 9\n\nFigure 8. MaliBot screen showing the MFA prompt.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. MaliBot code to select the correct prompt response based on the value from the C2 server.\n\n[back to top]\n\n### Injects\n\nWhen MaliBot registers the device to the C2, it also sends the device’s application list, which helps the C2 determine which\noverlays/injections to provide whenever an “injectlist” command is sent (Figure 10). The response from the server is a list of\napps and their associated injection link (Figure 11). Each injection link contains an HTML overlay that looks identical to the\noriginal app. Figure 12-Figure 15 show example injection overlays from financial institutions, in these cases based in Spain\nand Italy.\n\nFigure 10. MaliBot's C2 request for injection links and a list of viable targets.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. C2 response containing injection/overlay links.\n\nFigures 12, 13, 14, & 15\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12.

Overlay for app from Spanish bank CaixaBank.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. Overlay for app from Italian financial services organization CartaBCC.\n\nMaliBot listens for events using the Accessibility Service. If it detects that the victim has opened an app on the list of\ntargets, it will set up a WebView that displays an HTML overlay to the victim. Figure 16, Figure 17, and Figure 18 show the\napp listening for specific conditions, initiating an overlay attack, and setting up the WebView.\n\nFigure 16. Instructions beginning an injection attack if the frontmost application has an overlay available.\n\nFigure 17.

It has a number of methods to\naccomplish this, including the ability to steal cookies, multifactor authentication (MFA) codes and crypto wallets.\n\n**Cookies**\n\nMaliBot can steal credentials and cookies of the victim’s Google account. When the victim opens a Google app from the list\nbelow, MaliBot opens a WebView to a Google sign-in page (Figure 19). The victim is forced to sign in, as they cannot use\nthe back button to exit the WebView.\n\nFigure 19. Code snippet of process to detect Google app opening.\n\nThese are the Google Apps MaliBot monitors and initiates a WebView to collect credentials upon launch:\n\nMaliBot uses the “shouldInterceptRequest” WebView function to intercept the URLs that will be loaded to the WebView. By\nintercepting the URLs of the WebView, MaliBot knows which of four login stages the victim is in:\n\nhttps://accounts google[ ]com/signin/v2/identifier login page\n\n\n-----\n\nhttps://accounts.google[.]com/_/lookup/accountlookup Checks if Email exists\nhttps://accounts.google[.]com/_/signin/challenge - MFA challenge page\nhttps://myaccount.google[.]com – Successful login page\n\nMaliBot extracts the email and password entered to the WebView sign-in page using the Accessibility API. Before sending\nthe credentials to the C2 server (Figure 20), MaliBot creates redirections within the WebView to [Gmail,](https://mail.google.com/) [Google Pay, and](https://pay.google.com/)\n[Google Passwords and tries to grab the cookies of each redirection. MaliBot also uses the Accessibility API to try to capture](https://passwords.google.com/)\npasswords from Google Passwords.\n\nFigure 20. MaliBot sends email, password, recovery and cookie list to the C2 server.\n\n**Google Authenticator MFA Codes**\n\nSeparately from the Google multifactor authentication bypass listed above, MaliBot is also able to steal multifactor\nauthentication codes from Google Authenticator on-demand. When the C2 server sends a “2factor” command, the malware\nopens Google Authenticator (Figure 21 & Figure 22).\n\nFigure 21. Trigger function for stealing MFA codes.\n\nFigure 22. A separate trigger function for stealing MFA codes.\n\nWhenever Google Authenticator is open, the accessibility service will run the 2FA-code stealer task, which searches for an\nMFA-code on screen using a regular expressions pattern of XXX XXX (where X is a digit), as seen in Figure 23 & Figure 24,\nand then sends the codes to the C2 server (Figure 25).\n\nFigure 23. Regular expression pattern for Authenticator codes.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 24. Pattern matching against all of the text on the screen to detect MFA codes.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25. Logging and sending MFA codes to the C2 server.\n\nTo steal MFA codes that are sent to the victim via SMS, MaliBot captures and exfiltrates incoming SMS messages. To do\nso, MaliBot registers a class as an SMS receiver in the manifest (Figure 26).\n\nFigure 26. SMS receiver declared in the manifest.\n\nThis class inherits from BroadcastReceiver class – which would make the SMS receiver receive incoming SMS messages\nas an Intent. By calling Telephony.Sms.Intents.getMessagesFromIntent, the message is extracted from the Intent, then\nthe SMS receiver sends the incoming SMS message to the C2 server (Figure 27).\n\nFigure 27. MaliBot exfiltrating SMS messages to C2.\n\n**Crypto Wallets**\n\nMaliBot is also able to steal information from “Binance” and “Trust,” which are both well-known crypto-currency wallets.\n\nBinance\n\nMaliBot tries to retrieve the Total Balance from victim’s Binance wallet. To get to the Total Balance window, the malware\nuses the Accessibility Service to click through the app (Figure 28).\n\nFigure 28. MaliBot clicking through the Binance app using the Accessibility API to find the total balance.\n\nOnce the Total Balance is found (Figure 29), it then sends it to the C2 (Figure 30). If a login window is encountered during\nthe process it is logged to the C2 as an unauthorized access.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 29. Extracting the victim s total balance from Binance using the Accessibility API.\n\nFigure 30. Exfiltrating the victim's total balance in Binance to the C2. The “phrase” variable is the total balance of the\naccount.\n\nTrust\n\nMaliBot is able to steal the Total Balance as well as Seed Phrases (a sort of master password for the wallet) from the\nvictim’s Trust wallet (Figure 31).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 31. Example of Seed Phrases in the Trust app.\n\nSimilarly to how MaliBot locates the Total Balance in Binance, it clicks through the app using the Accessibility API until it\ngets to the relevant window. Once it finds the Total Balance, MaliBot tries to gather the Seed Phrases as well. Once it\nlocates them, it extracts them and removes the digits from the sides of each phrase (Figure 32) before exfiltrating the\ncurrency and Seed Phrases (Figure 33).\n\nFigure 32. Extraction and preparation of Seed Phrases.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 33. Exfiltration of balance and seed phrases to the C2 server.\n\n[back to top]\n\n### Full Remote Control of Infected Device\n\nThe Accessibility API of Android allows MaliBot to perform inputs as though it was the victim. It abuses this functionality to\nimplement something akin to a VNC server which allows remote control of the victim’s device. The attacker is able to obtain\nscreen captures from the victim and send input commands to the malware to perform actions. The remote control\ncommunicates with a hardcoded IP over HTTP port 1080 (see Indicators of Compromise) and offers several commands\n(Figure 34):\n\nback button\nhome button\nlock button\n“recents” button\nclick (x, y coordinates)\nlong press (x, y coordinates)\nswipe (x, y – x, y coordinates)\nscroll (x, y coordinates, amount)\nshow/hide overlay\ntake screenshot\npaste\nclear text\nstart an app\nupload app list\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 34. Command handling for VNC-like functionality.\n\nThis effectively creates an Accessibility API-based remote access trojan (RAT) that allows the attacker to conveniently\naccess the device remotely.\n\n[back to top]\n\n### SMS Sending\n\nMaliBot can send SMS messages on-demand, which is mostly used for smishing campaigns, but can also be used for\nmonetization by sending a Premium SMS which bills the victim’s mobile credits (if enabled). The malware verifies that it has\nSEND_SMS permission (Figure 35), waits for the “sendsms” command to be dispatched from the C2 (Figure 36), along with\na phone number list and a text to send, and then sends the text to every phone number in the list (Figure 37).\n\nFigure 35. MaliBot checking for SMS permissions.\n\nFigure 36. Code for MaliBot actions when it receives the \"sendsms\" command.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 37. MaliBot sending SMS messages to every phone number on the list provided by the C2.\n\n[back to top]\n\n### Logging\n\nMaliBot logs any uncaught exceptions, this helps the malware authors to find and fix bugs in their code (Figure 38).\n\nFigure 38. Error logging and reporting in the malware.\n\n[back to top]\n\n## Evasion and Stealth\n\n\n-----\n\nMalware authors commonly employ tactics to prevent victims from discovering malicious apps, and to make it harder for\nsecurity researchers to uncover their true purposes. MaliBot currently uses some of these capabilities and appears to have\nthe ability to use more in the future.\n\n### Current MaliBot Evasion Techniques\n\nAndroid is able to pause or kill a running service in the background if it’s not active or if the OS needs the resources. To\nkeep the Background Service of the malware alive, MaliBot sets itself as a launcher. Every time the launcher activity is\nvisited (which is very often) it starts or wakes up the service (Figure 39).\n\nFigure 39. MaliBot maintaining its Background Service by observing launcher activity.\n\nThis capability also allows the malware to get notified on every launched application and check whether an overlay/injection\nattack should be performed, according to the list of overlay-ready applications provided by the C2.\n\n[back to top]\n\n### Future Evasion Capabilities\n\nThe malware authors included functions in MaliBot that are not used in current version. Those functions could potentially be\nused in later versions, however, it is also possible that the malware authors copied code from somewhere else and not used\nthe entire functionality.\n\nOne example is a function that can detect if its running in an emulated environment. Another example is a function\nresponsible for setting the malware as a hidden app, so it won’t be visible in the app drawer. Both functions were seen and\nused in SOVA malware code.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 40. Unused capability in MaliBot that checks various device attributes against hardcoded values to determine\nwhether the device is running in an emulated environment.\n\n[back to top]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMaliBot is most obviously a threat to customers of Spanish and Italian banks, but we can expect a broader range of targets\nto be added to the app as time goes on. In addition, the versatility of the malware and the control it gives attackers over the\ndevice mean that it could, in principle, be used for a wider range of attacks than stealing credentials and cryptocurrency. In\nfact, any application which makes use of WebView is liable to having the users’ credentials and cookies stolen.\n\nThe F5 Labs [2022 Application Protection Report also noted that while the rise of ransomware has been the most dramatic](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/2022-application-protection-report-in-expectation-of-exfiltration)\nattacker trend in the last two years, 2021 also saw a more subtle rise in malware infections that exfiltrated data without\npursuing encryption and a ransom. Such a capable and versatile example of mobile malware serves as a reminder that the\nattack trends du jour are never the only threat worth paying attention to. We hope the following indicators of compromise\nare helpful for responders in mitigating this threat.\n\n**Think we got something wrong? Have questions for the authors?
