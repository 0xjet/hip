The target this time are personnel belonging to defence organizations\n& other Government organizations in India.\n\nIn the recent wave of attacks, APT36 is using honey trapping technique to lure their\ntargets. The “honey trap” operations use fake profiles of attractive women to entice\ntargets into opening their emails or chatting over messaging platforms, ultimately leading\nthem into downloading malware.\n\nSome of the attachment names that we found in the current themed attack:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen target opens such attachment, it drops MSIL based Crimson RAT which has been\nused by APT36 in many of their past attacks. This RAT is used for data-stealing activities\nand sending them to a CnC server.\n\n## Operation ‘Honey Trap’\n\nIndian Army has described ‘honey trap’ cases as a weapon of hybrid warfare being waged\nby the enemy across the borders. The same theme is now being used by APT36 to lure its\ntargets.\n\nImage: News feeds showing the use of ‘honey trap’ cases\n\n## Campaign Overview\n\n\n-----\n\nThis campaign continues to use two separate infection chains. These two infection\ntechniques of APT36 have remained the same in the past couple of years.\n\nIn the first chain, a spear-phishing email has a macro loaded document as an attachment.\nThis document is responsible to execute a dropper module that starts the Crimson RAT\ntool to perform malicious activity.\n\nImage: Infection Chain – Scenario 1\n\nIn the second chain, a spear-phishing email attachment directly contains a dropper\nmodule within a zip file. This dropper component opens a decoy document for the victim\nand runs Crimson RAT tool in the background to perform malicious activity.\n\nImage: Infection Chain – Scenario 2\n\nThe second infection chain is not so successful in organizations as their firewalls usually\nblock ‘EXE’ filetype within an email. This is the main reason, it is targeting personal\naccounts of individuals related to the Indian Defence sector.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Crimson RAT\n\nCrimson RAT remains a popular arsenal on APT36 group. We had published details of\nanother APT36 attack last month; working of the malware remains the same.\n\nhttps://www.seqrite.com/resources/transparent-tribe-targetting-critical-indianorganizations\n\nSummarized behaviour of this RAT\nProcess:\n\nList processes\nKill process\nExecute commands\nFile:\n\nDrives, files and directory traversal\nDelete files\nExecute files\nSearch for file extensions\nMetadata extraction\nCapture Screen:\n\nSingle and Continuous screenshots\nGet Thumbnails, Screen Size\nData Exfiltration:\n\nDownload from C2\nUpload to C2\n\nShown here are some functionality implementations in crimson RAT code:\n\nImage: Functionality to list all running process\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: Functionality to check and add startup entry in the registry\n\nImage: Functionality to search files of a given extension\n\nImage: Functionality to capture screenshot.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt is a well-established fact, that APT36 targets defence and other critical sector\norganizations. Usually, their targets are individuals and organizations which are of\nstrategic interest to India’s western neighbour. However, in this campaign, interestingly,\n\n\n-----\n\nsome of the targeted entities belong to organizations based in the eastern states in India!\nIn last one year, this is the second instance where we saw APT36 targeting organizations\nof interest to India’s eastern neighbour\n\n**IOCs associated to the honeytrap campaign:**\n\n\n03E499D6E15817F5C7EF0F4F2FFD6D27\n0FD5FD92A6D8467A892C889B7DE49FC2\n\n11C594AF9B478A1EC688E874BCF61FE9\n\n2B22AC62E5843F22F4A51149ADE2D6D1\n\n3709CE3826A3AEBA20341ED2EF38259F\n\n3952EBEDF24716728B7355B8BE8E71B6\n\n467B10934E97D66E738E56501C22D1C4\n\n46B9FA19A52D0E83B63280547630BB33\n\n485F08EE7F741219BC1F2438319A33E4\n\n4B7D87FFA7D243A32D6D516583B04B8A\n\n4C0E752600746B6D67CF1D49C103D64A\n\n4DC350105A7879E14780B0A353816BC5\n\n5111974611588AFFE86C99EB9897FE02\n\n589729BC673FE05A2F3B4C85797E2CE6\n\n60BC356B4C88431353756B9496CF8F55\n\n6368B4E339D04B30DA20AF70C67EC743\n\n6801133F37481D8D865E984766E49D34\n\n6B2931A1E68E8C9B02B815DC8065B4F8\n\n6C11F92F6646E696724DE47D41ADC9F0\n\n6DAA8DB3ED3661F9BC708E9B3E5F5C3C\n\n8B22B21F258207F6B2C71483EAFF8CA6\n\n8D34A25D139F836FD36BBEB869A6BD3F\n\n\n92A16E790F69E68C393B3BEEA15E14AA\n94C00B72C37D5EB00E6B200AA71295C7\n\n9C9A6005C14D4EDFF392EE174E3A6964\n\nA15602E81A2E9860463F83ED66E7FFFD\n\nA22DBB859B380E375DF17D0751E407F5\n\nA7C8DD395CD707794A8BFFE9C06A6344\n\nA93F9E7325567A01357C565F2875C02F\n\nB6E5D3B7F74B99CB039B8226AAFE6E08\n\nC0C2BCA1B2668D10D0B26E0F6DB34A64\n\nC32E6BC20F46CF0EB6E3608F35651195\n\nC9895D76ACE01B7A1DB407B18059B785\n\nCBFAE579A25DF1E2FE0E02934EFD65DC\n\nD504CAB93AB055267BDD7693BFCFED5B\n\nD9CE6D2F89AFADD13D42CAC313C91582\n\nE670F157F988FA13317CD878DEB55697\n\nE89E1D0CDB0C0653744E5D12B6262F07\n\nE8AA25A0D8A95E43712765FEFAC3C068\n\nEA371D9282AB9C2A7274C5C8ACA9A64A\n\nF0C1AEA58025973D254FF9FD08599E65\n\nF70B3DA6C795B544FAC4F90AE4B45BA2\n\nFE74761CE3EEDB20FF50FEFE9C2D49EF\n\nFF2F32C78688AEC15C1283B1E625E72A\n\n\n-----\n\n**Subject matter experts:**\nPavankumar Chaudhari\nKalpesh Mantri\n\n\n-----",
