From the start of the operation till\nmid-September of the same year the group leaked the data of more than a dozen\nvictims on their blog similarly to other groups of this type. The ransomware group\nexercises double and triple extortion on them.\n\n[The INC Ransom group was first observed by security researchers in early August](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1689029459255373826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1689029459255373826%7Ctwgr%5E3c1ece7a60842b30436b7b6dadeb7ca042333bd8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huntress.com%2Fblog%2Finvestigating-new-inc-ransom-group-activity)\n2023.\nThe group’s victims are mostly businesses from the private sector and the victims list\n[also includes a government organization and a charity association. All known victims](https://twitter.com/BrettCallow/status/1704532305442910429)\nare exclusively from Western countries with the majority of them from the United\nStates and Europe (a single victim was from Singapore).\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\nSegmentation Of Victims By Industry & Country Of Origin\n\nThroughout the negotiation with the victims, the group publishes a “proof pack”\nconsisting of several photos of private data (employer’s ID, professional charts, etc.),\nand additional information to motivate their victims to pay. In one case, the actor\naccused one of the victims of money laundering, implying that the victim had\nmoney to pay the ransom of 160,000 USD. In another case, the threat actor\nthreatened two of the victim's customers to carry out a supply chain attack in case\nthe victim, an IT provider, didn't pay the ransom.\n\nINC Ransom’s leak blog, besides hosting the published leaks, has light and dark UI\noptions, a feedback box, and a link to the group’s Twitter account. The leaks blog user\ninterface carries some similarities to LockBit 3.0’s Ransomware leak blog; however, as\nopposed to LockBit, INC does not charge for the leaked data.\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\nLockBit 3.0’s Leak Blog\n\nINC’s Leak Blog\n\nMeanwhile, the victims have a separate site where the negotiation with the group is\ndone. The site requires them to open a user account with the user ID that has been\ncommunicated in the ransom note, and a password of their choice.\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\nINC’s Feedback Box INC’s Victim Sign In Page\n\n[When it comes to modus operandi, INC cases seem to be similar to other](https://www.huntress.com/blog/investigating-new-inc-ransom-group-activity)\nransomware groups. The group uses compromised credentials to gain access to a\nvictim environment and move laterally using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol). When\ncompromising new machines, another credential theft command occurs using the\nscripts. Eventually, the operators deploy the ransomware using WMIC and PSEXEC.\n\nIn order to exfiltrate data, the group was observed using the MegaSync tool, which\nhas also been used by other ransomware group affiliates.\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\n## ANALYSIS\n\nIn this section, the Cybereason team describes the INC ransomware behavior based\non a dynamic and static approach, mainly relying on reverse-engineering of the\nransomware samples we obtained.\n\nThe ransomware's initial ability is dependent on the command-line arguments that\nthe ransomware operator gives:\n\n   - _- - file: Encrypt a given file_\n\n   -   - - dir: Encrypt a given directory\n\n   - _- - sup: stands for “stop using process”, killing a given process_\n\n   - _- - ens: encrypt network shares_\n\n   - _- - lhd: load hidden drives_\n\n   - _- - debug: Print messages to the screen about the encryption process_\n\nCommand-Line Arguments\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\nCommand-Line Arguments\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter setting the parameters, the ransomware decrypts its ransom notes. It uses the\nfunction CryptStringToBinaryA two times to decrypt content stored in base64 which\ncontains the ransom note.\n\nRansomware Note Decryption Process\n\nIn each encrypted directory, the ransomware will drop two ransom notes, one as a\n_.txt file and the other in .html format._\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\nDecrypted Ransomware Note\n\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Command-Line Arguments\n\n##### Load Hidden Drives\n\nIf the lhd (load hidden drives) parameter was set, the ransomware will check for any\nhidden drive (A-Z) to mount to encrypt it.\n\nHidden Drive Encryption Function\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Encrypt Network Shares\n\nNext, if the parameter ens (encrypt network shares) parameter was set, the\nransomware will check if there are any other kinds of shared data storage to encrypt:\n\n   - _DRIVE_FIXED - external hard drives_\n\n   - _DRIVE_REMOVABLE - USB sticks_\n\n   - _DRIVE_REMOTE - shared network_\n\nNetwork Share Encryption Function\n\n##### Stop Using Processes\n\nIf the argument –sup (stop using processes) is set, the ransomware will use the\nMicrosoft Win32 application, Restart Manager, to kill any process that has a handle or\naccessing a resource that the ransomware wants to encrypt. This approach was also\nobserved in other ransomware groups such as Lockbit, Babuk, and Royal.\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\nStop Using Processes Function\n\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\n### Deleting Shadow Copies\n\nAfter all the preparations are set, the ransomware will continue to delete the volume\nshadow copy backups from the victim's machine. It will use the API DeviceIoControl\nwith the dwIoControlCode parameter set to 0x53C028. This code is translated to an\nundocumented IOCTL “IOCTL_VOLSNAP_SET_MAX_DIFF_AREA_SIZE” which resizes\nthe allocated space for shadow copies snapshots and causes the deletion of them.\n\nVolume Shadow Copy Deletion Function\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\n### Exclusions\n\nBefore encrypting, INC will inspect the file and exclude it from encryption if it has\none of the following extensions:\n\n_●_ _.msi_\n\n_●_ _.exe_\n\n_●_ _.dll_\n\n_●_ _.inc_\n\nFile Encryption Exclusions\n\nIn addition to extensions, it will exclude the directories that contain the following\nstring in their names:\n\n   - Windows\n\n   - Program files\n\n   - Program files (x86)\n\n   - $RECYCLE.BIN\n\n   - appdata\n\n   - INC\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\nFile Directory Exclusions\n\n### PhysicallyPrinting The Ransom Note\n\nINC ransomware actively seeks out available printers in the network and sends the\ncommand to print the ransom note.\n\nINC verifies the presence of the specific drivers, Microsoft Print to PDF or Microsoft\nXPS Document Writer, on the targeted host system. It then tries to print the ransom\nnote through the printer connected to it. This approach not only adds an extra layer\nof intimidation to its victims but also serves as a visual reminder of the intrusion.\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware Note Print Function\n\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\n### Changing The Wallpaper\n\nAnother notable capability of INC ransomware is the ability to change the host\nbackground wallpaper image. At the end of the attack, INC changes the background\nwallpaper and displays the ransom note on the screen using the “Fixedsys” font.\n\nRansomware Notification\n\nRansomware Background Display Modification Function\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\n## Encryption Process\n\nINC uses multi-threading to speed up the encryption process. The number of\nthreads will be the number of processors multiplied by 4. In addition, to synchronize\nthe threads, INC will choose to use Completion Ports.\n\n[According to MSDN, “I/O completion ports provide an efficient threading model for](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/i-o-completion-ports)\nprocessing multiple asynchronous I/O requests on a multiprocessor system”.\n\nRansomware Multi-Threading Support\n\nAnother approach to speeding up the encryption is partial encryption, INC\nimplements its partial encryption in the following manner:\n\n   - If the file is smaller than 1 MB:\n\n      - The entire file will be encrypted\n\n   - If the file is larger than 1 MB but smaller than 3MB:\n\n      - 1 MB will be encrypted\n\n      - The rest will not be encrypted\n\n   - If the file is larger than 3MB:\n\n      - Encryption intervals of encrypting 1MB and not encrypting 2MB\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware Partial Encryption Schema\n\nThe intervals of encryption can also be seen clearly in the process monitor.\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\nProcess Monitor Output During Partial Encryption\n\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\n## DETECTION AND PREVENTION\n\n### Cybereason Defense Platform\n\n[The Cybereason Defense Platform is able to detect and prevent INC ransomware](https://www.cybereason.com/platform)\ninfections using multi-layer malware protection that leverages threat intelligence,\n[machine learning, anti-ransomware, next-gen antivirus (NGAV), and Variant Payload](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOswitXwSPI)\n[Prevention capabilities.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOswitXwSPI)\n\nThe Cybereason Defense Platform Detects & Prevents INC-related MalOp\n\nCYBEREASON RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe Cybereason GSOC & Security Research teams recommend the following actions\nin the Cybereason Defense Platform:\n\n   - Enable Application Control to block the execution of malicious files.\n\n   - Enable Anti-Ransomware in your environment’s policies, set the\n[Anti-Ransomware mode to Prevent, and enable Shadow Copy detection to](https://www.cybereason.com/platform/ransomware-protection)\nensure maximum protection against ransomware.\n\n   - Enable Variant Payload Prevention with prevent mode on Cybereason\nBehavioral execution prevention.\n\ncybereason.com\n\n\n-----\n\n   - To hunt proactively, use the Investigation screen in the Cybereason Defense\nPlatform and the queries in the Hunting Queries section to search for\nmachines that are potentially infected with INC Ransomware.\n\n      - Based on the search results, take further remediation actions, such as\nisolating the infected machines and deleting the payload file.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK MAPPING\n\n**Tactic** **Technique or Sub-technique**\n\n[TA0005: Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005) [T1083: File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/)\n\n[TA0007: Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/) [T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/)\n\n[TA0007: Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/) [T1046: Network Service Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1046/)\n\n[TA0007: Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/) [T1057: Process Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1057/)\n\n[TA0007: Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/) [T1082: System Information Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)\n\n[TA0007: Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/) [T1135: Network Share Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0575/)\n\n[TA0040: Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0040) [T1486: Data Encrypted for Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)\n\n[TA0040: Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0040) [T1489: Service Stop](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1489/)\n\n[TA0040: Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0040) [T1490: Inhibit System Recovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490/)\n\n[TA0002: Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/) [T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/)\n\n**Indicator** **Descriptio**\n\n**Indicators** **type** **n**\n\nINC\n\nfcefe50ed02c8d315272a94f860451bfd3d86fa6ffac215e69dfa26a7a SHA256 Ransomwar\n5deced e Binary\n\ncybereason.com\n\n|Tactic|Technique or Sub-technique|\n|---|---|\n|TA0005: Discovery|T1083: File and Directory Discovery|\n|TA0007: Discovery|T1016: System Network Confgi uration Discovery|\n|TA0007: Discovery|T1046: Network Service Discovery|\n|TA0007: Discovery|T1057: Process Discovery|\n|TA0007: Discovery|T1082: System Information Discovery|\n|TA0007: Discovery|T1135: Network Share Discovery|\n|TA0040: Impact|T1486: Data Encrypted for Impact|\n|TA0040: Impact|T1489: Service Stop|\n|TA0040: Impact|T1490: Inhibit System Recovery|\n|TA0002: Execution|T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter|\n\n|Indicators|Indicator type|Descriptio n|\n|---|---|---|\n|fcefe50ed02c8d315272a94f860451bfd3d86fa6ffac215e69dfa26a7a 5deced|SHA256|INC Ransomwar e Binary|\n\n\n-----\n\n### About the Authors\n\n\nMarina Popelov, Security Analyst, Security Research Team\n\n\nMarina is a security and threat intelligence analyst at Cybereason.\nShe began her career in the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) as an open\nsource intelligence analyst (OSInt) analyst and today specializes in\nweb and dark web intelligence.\n\n\nEli Salem, Security & Malware Researcher, Security Research Team\n\n\nEli is a Security and malware reverse engineer at Cybereason.
