According to Sherstuk’s interviews\n\n with the press, over 9000 artillery personnel have been using\n\n the application in Ukrainian military.\n\n • \u0007Successful deployment of the FANCY BEAR malware within\n\n this application may have facilitated reconnaissance against\n\n Ukrainian troops. The ability of this malware to retrieve\n\n communications and gross locational data from an infected\n\n device makes it an attractive way to identify the general location\n\n of Ukrainian artillery forces and engage them.\n\n • \u0007Open source reporting indicates that Ukrainian artillery forces\n\n have lost over 50% of their weapons in the 2 years of conflict and\n\n over 80% of D-30 howitzers, the highest percentage of loss of any\n\n other artillery pieces in Ukraine's arsenal.\n\n • \u0007This previously unseen variant of X-Agent represents FANCY\n\n BEAR’s expansion in mobile malware development from iOS\n capable implants to Android devices, and reveals one more\n\n component of the broad spectrum approach to cyber operations\n\n taken by Russia-based actors in the war in Ukraine.\n\n • \u0007The collection of such tactical artillery force positioning\n\n intelligence by FANCY BEAR further supports CrowdStrike’s\n\n previous assessments that FANCY BEAR is likely affiliated with\n\n the Russian military intelligence (GRU), and works closely with\n\n Russian military forces operating in Eastern Ukraine and its\n\n border regions in Russia.\n\n\n#### “\n###### OPEN-SOURCE\n REPORTING INDICATES\n LOSSES OF ALMOST 50% OF EQUIPMENT IN\n THE LAST 2 YEARS OF\n CONFLICT AMONGST UKRAINIAN ARTILLERY FORCES AND OVER 80%\n OF D-30 HOWITZERS WERE LOST, FAR MORE THAN ANY OTHER PIECE\n OF UKRAINIAN\n\n ARTILLERY 9.\n\n#### ”\n\n\n-----\n\n##### BACKGROUND\n\nIn late June and August 2016, CrowdStrike Intelligence provided initial\n\nreporting and technical analysis of a variant of the FANCY BEAR implant\n\nX-Agent that targeted the Android mobile platform[2]. CrowdStrike\n\nidentified this X-Agent variant within a legitimate Android application\n\nnamed Попр-Д30.apk. This app was developed and used by artillery\n\ntroops to simplify targeting data for the D-30 towed howitzer. CrowdStrike\n\ninvestigation reveals that this app has been utilized in a possible training\n\nor operational role in at least one unit of the Ukrainian military. Therefore,\n\nthe implant likely targeted military artillery units operating against pro\nRussian separatists in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nThis implant represents further advancements in FANCY BEAR’s\n\ndevelopment of mobile malware for targeted intrusions and extends\n\nRussian cyber capabilities to the front lines of the battlefield. This Tipper\n\nbuilds on CrowdStrike’s previous reporting by providing a timeline\n\nof events, contextual discussion regarding the potential drivers for\n\ndevelopment and deployment of the malware, and a description of the\n\nanalytical process resulting in targeting assessments. Finally, this Tipper\n\nleverages these assessments, in conjunction with more recently observed\n\nactivity by Russia-based adversaries, to determine the potential for any\n\nfuture activity in the mobile malware threat space.\n\n\n#### “\n###### CROWDSTRIKE\n IDENTIFIED THIS X-AGENT VARIANT WITHIN A LEGITIMATE ANDROID APPLICATION NAMED ПОПР-Д30.APK.\n THIS APP WAS DEVEL­\n OPED AND USED BY ARTILLERY TROOPS TO\n SIMPLIFY TARGETING\n DATA FOR THE D-30\n TOWED HOWITZER\n\n#### ”\n\n\n-----\n\nRussia offers\nUkraine loans and\n\ndiscounts on gas\n\n###### JAN FEB MAR\n\n**ПОПР-Д**\n\n###### 20 14\n\nProtests reach their\npeak, gov’t cracks down\n\nviolently; agreement\nreached for elections;\n\nYanukovich flees to\n\nRussia\n\nCyberBerkut\n\nEmerges\n\n\nIndividual believed to be the\n\ndeveloper promotes Android\nApp on Russian Social Media\n\nKremlin threatens Ukraine\nSite vKontakte\n\nover EU agreement\n\n**П О П Р -Д 3 0**\n**DE VELO PED**\n\n**2 0 FEB -**\n\n**13 APR**\n\n###### FEB MAR APR MAY JUNE JULY AUG SEPT OCT\n\n**POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT TIME FRAME: MALICIOUS X-AGENT IMPLANT INJECT FOR**\n\nUkraine’s Parliament\nconvenes and plans to lay\n\nfoundation for EU\nAssociation Agreement\n\n## LEGEND\n\n######   \u0007Events associated with the Android app\n\n   International Events or Diplomacy Efforts\n\n   Ukrainian Domestic Affairs\n\n   Targeted Intrusion, DDoS or Disinformation\n\n   Russian / Ukrainian Confrontation\n\n\nAnon Ops vs.\nUkraine Gov’t Web­\nsites - Defacements\n\nand DDoS\n\n\nDDoS and targeted\nintrusions in media,\nfinancial, & political\n\nentities in Ukraine\n\n\nGazprom increases\ngas prices, Ukraine\n\nskips payment\n\n\nIntrusions into\n\nUkraine’s\nTransportation\n\nSector\n\nPresidential\n\nElections in\n\nUkraine\n\n###### JULY AUG\n\n**ARMED CONFLICT IN UKRAINE**\n\nIntrusion against\nUkraine’s Central\n\nElection\nCommission\n\n\nObserved in\nDistribution on Forums\n\n###### DEC\n\nEarliest public\n\nreporting on\nthe Android App\ndeveloped by the\nUkrainian soldier\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|J ET BE||\n\n|M|ALICIOUS|APP DIS|TRIBUTION|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n|CyberBerkut Releases Info CyberBerkut Defaces Associated With Claimed Bellingcat Website Intrusion into Ukraine’s Security Service SBU JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUNE JULY AUG SEPT OCT NOV DEC LIKELY RUSSIA-BASED RECONNAISSANCE OF UK MALICIOUS APP DEVELOPMENT, DEPLOYMENT, AND USAGE TIME FRAME LA|Attack on Kiev Airport System JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUNE JULY AUG SEPT OCT NOV DEC RAINIAN GOVERNMENT AND/OR MILITARY TARGETS TE APRIL 2013 - AND BEYOND|\n|---|---|\n|20 15 20 16 ARMED CONFLICT IN UKRAINE First Minsk Ceasefire Minsk II Protocol Collapses signed Developer of benign app promoted within Ukrainian military Reported testing Targeted intrusions Pro-Russian Hacktivist period for ArtOS against Ukraine’s Group Sprut Emerges Ministry of Defense News story associating app author as head of the ArtOS project, a joint en­ LEGEND Crimea lacks deavor with the Noosphere||\n\n\nForums discussing the app\nand claiming to be associat­\ned with the developers users\n\nare called out as fraudulent\nsome users claim copy apps\n\nare distributing malware\n\n\n## LEGEND\n\n######   \u0007Events associated with the Android app\n\n   International Events or Diplomacy Efforts\n\n   Ukrainian Domestic Affairs\n\n   Targeted Intrusion, DDoS or Disinformation\n\n   Russian / Ukrainian Confrontation\n\n\nCyber attacks\nagainst Ukrainian\n\npower stations\n\n###### DEC JAN\n\n**LIKELY RUSSIA-BASED RECONNAISSANCE OF UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT AND/OR MILITARY TARGETS**\n\n**ARMED CONFLICT IN UKRAINE**\n\nCrimea lacks\nelectricity after\nphysical attack\n\n\nEngineering School\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TIMELINE OF EVENTS\n##### DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION PROCESS\n OF THE BENIGN APPLICATION\n\nThe original application central to this discussion, Попр-Д30.apk, was\n\ninitially developed domestically within Ukraine by a member of the 55th\n\nArtillery Brigade. Based on the file creation timestamps as well as the\n\napp signing process, which occurred on 28 March 2013, CrowdStrike has\n\ndetermined that the app was developed sometime between 20 February\n\nand 13 April 2013.\n\nShortly after that time frame, on 28 April 2013, an individual bearing the\n\nsame name as the application’s developer promoted the application\n\non Russian vKontakte[3] pages associated with the artillery forces. The\n\npromotion of the program was likely limited to social media, and the\n\ndistribution was controlled from the author’s main page, «Програмное\n\nобеспечение современного боя» (translation: \"Modern combat software\").[4]\n\nAs an additional control measure, the program was only activated for\n\nuse after the developer was contacted and issued a code to the individual\n\ndownloading the application.\n\nNo evidence of the application has been observed on the Android app\n\nstore, making it unlikely that the app was distributed via that platform.\n\nThe control measures established by the developer to limit the use and\n\nproliferation of the Попр-Д30.apk application, coupled with its unique\n\npurpose, make its broad distribution on the Android store improbable.\n\nAt the time of this writing, it is unclear to what degree and for how\n\nlong this specific application was utilized by the entirety of the\n\nUkrainian Artillery Forces. Based on open source reporting, social\n\nmedia posts, and video evidence, CrowdStrike assesses that Попр-Д30.apk\n\nwas potentially used through 2016 by at least one artillery unit operating\n\nin eastern Ukraine.\n\n##### RECONNAISSANCE, DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION\n OF THE MALICIOUS APPLICATION\n\n**RECONNAISSANCE**\n\nGiven the estimated development timeframe and the promotional period\n\nfor the benign Попр-Д30.apk application, the program was likely available\n\nonline for distribution after late April 2013. CrowdStrike Intelligence\n\nassesses that the application likely came to the attention of Russia\nbased adversaries around this time frame as a result of ongoing Russian\n\n\n#### “\n###### THE ORIGINAL,\n BENIGN APPLICATION\n ENABLED ARTILLERY\n FORCES TO MORE\n RAPIDLY PROCESS\n TARGETING DATA FOR\n THE D-30 HOWITZER\n REDUCING TARGETING\n TIME FROM MINUTES DOWN TO 15 SECONDS.\n\n#### ”\n\n\n-----\n\nreconnaissance associated with the revolution in Ukraine. Actors with a\n\nnexus to Russia regularly monitor social media sites in order to better\n\nunderstand or formulate operations against their targets.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence has noted instances in which some Russia-based\n\nactors and attribution front groups have leveraged information obtained\n\nfrom Ukrainian social media sites in order to perform operations. The\n\nmost notable recent example of this was in the case of extortion-based\n\nthreats directed against the Polish Government.[5] In this particular case,\n\nthe perpetrators likely sought out openly available account information\n\nfrom a vKontakte page belonging to a Ukrainian citizen, who was soliciting\n\ndonations to aid volunteer soldiers fighting in eastern Ukraine. The adversary\n\nthen used this profile information, in conjunction with the name \"Pravyy\n\nSector,\" to make it appear as though the extortion threats against the Polish\n\ngovernment were originating from an ultranationalist Ukrainian group.\n\nCrowdStrike has assessed that by performing this type of deceptive\n\noperation the perpetrator likely sought to make it appear as though\n\nUkrainian interests were threatening the Polish government. In addition,\n\nbecause the individual account hijacked for this operation had been used to\n\ntry to raise funds for Ukrainian forces, the adversary may have been trying to\n\naggravate Western governments enough to freeze the individual’s accounts.\n\nThe attack did not appear to achieve its intended result. Poland rebuffed the\n\nthreats, and the owner of the vKontakte page denounced any involvement\n\nin the threat. Subsequently the Pravyy Sector group scrubbed their social\n\nmedia page of much of the information associated with this failed operation.\n\nThis particular incident is an example of how a disinformation operation is\n\nstaged. While this incident is not likely to be related to the development of\n\nthe X-Agent Android variant, it demonstrates the reconnaissance and pre\nplanning tactics that precede the rest of a campaign. Development\n\nand Distribution\n\nCrowdStrike has discovered indications that as early as 2015 FANCY BEAR\n\nlikely developed X-Agent applications for the iOS environment, targeting\n\n\"jailbroken\" Apple mobile devices. The use of the X-Agent implant in the\n\noriginal Попр-Д30.apk application appears to be the first observed case\n\nof FANCY BEAR malware developed for the Android mobile platform. On 21\n\nDecember 2014 the malicious variant of the Android application was first\n\nobserved in limited public distribution on a Russian language, Ukrainian\n\nmilitary forum. A late 2014 public release would place the development\n\ntimeframe for this implant sometime between late-April 2013 and early\n\nDecember 2014.\n\n\n#### “\n###### FOR UKRAINIAN TROOPS, ARTILLERY FORCES HAVE\n ALSO SHOULDERED A\n HEAVY COST. IN 2 YEARS OF CONFLICT, THEY HAVE LOST NEARLY\n 50% OF THEIR ARTILLERY PIECES AND\n OVER 80% OF D-30\n HOWITZERS, FAR MORE\n THAN ANY OTHER PIECE OF UKRAINIAN\n ARTILLERY.\n\n#### ”\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring that proposed development timeframe, a number of significant\n\nevents unfolded between Ukraine, Russia, and the international\n\ncommunity. Most notably, Russian attempts to influence Ukrainian-EU\n\nrelations resulted in the large-scale, Maidan protest movement, eventually\n\nresulting in the ouster of then-president Victor YANUKOVYCH, the invasion\n\nand annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia, and the protracted\n\narmed conflict in eastern Ukraine. Therefore, the creation of an application\n\nthat targets some of the front line forces pivotal in Ukrainian defense\n\non the eastern front would likely be a high priority for Russian adversary\n\nmalware developers seeking to turn the tide of the conflict in their favor.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed that the distribution of the\n\nmalicious application targeted the very artillery units for which the benign\n\napplication was developed—brigades operating in eastern Ukraine on the\n\nfrontlines of the conflict with Russian-backed separatist forces during\n\nthe early stages of the conflict in late-2014. This assessment is based on a\n\nnumber of factors, but chief among them is the likelihood that a military\n\nmember would only trust and use an application designed to calculate\n\nsomething as critical as targeting data if it was developed and promoted\n\nby a member of their own forces. The type of operational activity described\n\nhere suggests an extremely sophisticated understanding of the target that\n\nonly a skilled adversary would likely possess.\n\nBy late December 2014, the total number of Russian forces in the region\n\nwas approximately 10,000 troops.[6] Because the Android malware could\n\nfacilitate gross position information, its successful deployment could\n\nhave facilitated anticipatory awareness of Ukrainian artillery force troop\n\nmovement, thus providing Russian forces with useful strategic planning\n\ninformation. Indeed, the 55th Artillery Brigade and similar artillery units\n\noperated frequently against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nA video posted on 18 October 2015[7] specifically shows them employing the\n\nПопр-Д30.apk application and operating in the vicinity of eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe choice of the Russian language character set in the application further\n\nunderscores the targeting of forces within eastern Ukraine, as Russian is the\n\npredominant language utilized in that region. An assessment of languages\n\nspoken by region based on the most recent census information illustrates\n\nthe permeation of the Russian language in that region and highlights the\n\nvalue of providing Russian in the malicious Попр-Д30.apk application.\n\nOne alternative theory regarding the use of the Russian language in the\n\napplication could be that targeting may have been directed at pro-Russian\n\n\n#### “\n###### CROWDSTRIKE\n INTELLIGENCE HAS\n ASSESSED THAT THE\n DISTRIBUTION OF THE\n MALICIOUS APPLICATION\n\n TARGETED THE VERY\n ARTILLERY UNITS FOR\n WHICH THE BENIGN\n\n APPLICATION WAS\n DEVELOPED—BRIGADES OPERATING IN EASTERN\n UKRAINE ON THE\n FRONTLINES OF THE\n\n CONFLICT WITH\n RUSSIAN-BACKED\n SEPARATIST FORCES\n DURINGTHE EARLY\n STAGES OF THE CONFLICT\n\n IN LATE-2014.\n\n#### ”\n\n\n-----\n\n### L A N G U A G E S S P O K E N B Y R E G I O N\n\n###### W E S T C E N T E R S O U T H E A S T D O N B A S S\n\n U R K A N I A N 92.6% 78.2% 35.3% 37.4% 19.9%\n\n U R K A N I A N &\n\n 2.9% 16.6% 38.4% 34.4% 34%\n R U S S I A N E Q U A L L Y\n\n R U S S I A N 2% 4.2% 20% 25.9% 40.4%\n\n O T H E R 1.6% .4% 5.4% 1.3% 5.2%\n\n U N C L E A R .9% .6% .9% 1% .5%\n\nDistribution of Russian/Ukrainian Language Use in Ukraine[8]\n\n\nforces operating in eastern Ukraine. A relevant and likely counterargument for this theory, however, is that Russian\n\nforces likely have employed fire support systems and other technologies that can already calculate targeting data,\n\nnegating the need for an application to perform this task. Additionally, the application was initially developed by a\n\nmember of the Ukrainian army. An opposing force would probably not adopt technology developed by the enemy for use\n\non the battlefield.\n\n##### OUTCOMES AND CONCLUSION\n\nThe eastern Ukrainian front has been markedly impacted by heavy fighting involving Russian troops and pro-Russian\n\nrebel fighters deployed to this region. Artillery forces on both sides of the conflict have served an important role. For\n\nUkrainian troops, artillery forces have also shouldered a heavy cost. Open-source reporting indicates losses of almost\n\n50% of equipment in the last 2 years of conflict amongst Ukrainian artillery forces and over 80% of D-30 howitzers were\n\nlost, far more than any other piece of Ukrainian artillery 9.[9]\n\nBetween July and August 2014, Russian backed forces launched some of the most decisive attacks against Ukrainian\n\nforces, resulting in significant loss of life, weaponry, and territory. According to open sources, Ukrainian service\n\npersonnel from the 24th and 72nd Mechanized Brigade, as well as the 79th Airborne Brigade, were among the units to\n\nhave suffered casualties. International monitoring groups later assessed some of the attacks were likely to have come\n\nfrom inside Russian territory.[10]\n\nA malware-infected Попр-Д30.apk application probably could not have provided all the necessary data required to\n\ndirectly facilitate the types of tactical strikes that occurred between July and August 2014. Eyewitness accounts from\n\nindividuals within the impacted units reported seeing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used in the area prior to one\n\nattack, underscoring the need for precise locational data for these particular strikes and introducing the possibility\n\n\n-----\n\nthat the Android malware served to support the reconnaissance role of\n\ntraditional battlefield assets. Although traditional overhead intelligence\n\nsurveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) assets were likely still needed\n\nto finalize tactical movements, the ability of this application to retrieve\n\ncommunications and gross locational data from infected devices, could\n\nprovide insight for further planning, coordination, and tasking of ISR,\n\nartillery assets, and fighting forces.\n\nThe X-Agent Android variant does not exhibit a destructive function and does\n\nnot interfere with the function of the original Попр-Д30.apk application.\n\nTherefore, CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed that the likely role of\n\nthis malware is strategic in nature. The capability of the malware includes\n\ngaining access to contacts, Short Message Service (SMS) text messages,\n\ncall logs, and internet data, and FANCY BEAR would likely leverage this\n\ninformation for its intelligence and planning value.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence assesses a tool such as this has the potential\n\nability to map out a unit’s composition and hierarchy, determine their plans,\n\nand even triangulate their approximate location. This type of strategic\n\nanalysis can enable the identification of zones in which troops are operating\n\nand help prioritize assets within those zones for future targeting.\n\nAdditionally, a study provided by the International Institute of Strategic\n\nStudies determined that the weapons platform bearing the highest losses\n\nbetween 2013 and 2016 was the D-30 towed howitzer.[11] It is possible that\n\nthe deployment of this malware infected application may have contributed\n\nto the high-loss nature of this platform.\n\nThe development of the X-Agent Android malware represents an expansion\n\nof FANCY BEAR capabilities in terms of mobile malware, and illustrates\n\nthe practical application of full-spectrum combat as envisioned in the\n\neponymous doctrinal writings of General Valery GERASIMOV. As a part\n\nof full-spectrum operations in Ukraine, Russia-based adversaries have\n\nleveraged malware on the battlefield, in the civil sector, and against\n\ncritical infrastructure. They have also engaged in aggressive information\n\noperations in the media. In relation to this broader picture of Russian\n\ncomputer operations, the approach to targeting mobile smartphone and\n\ntablet devices in order to gain strategic insight into communications is a\n\ntactic that cannot be disregarded.\n\nCrowdStrike assesses that the observed and described X-Agent implant\n\ntargeting Ukrainian military Android devices running the Попр-Д30.apk\n\n\n#### “\n###### CROWDSTRIKE\n INTELLIGENCE ASSESSES\n A TOOL SUCH AS THIS\n HAS THE POTENTIAL ABILITY TO MAP OUT A\n UNIT’S COMPOSITION\n AND HIERARCHY,\n DETERMINE THEIR\n PLANS, AND EVEN\n TRIANGULATE THEIR APPROXIMATE LOCATION\n\n#### ”\n\n\n-----\n\napplication is likely only the initial iteration of this type of malware. While\n\nthis malware was initially discovered in a battlefield environment, an\n\nadversary could also leverage it in attacks against non-military targets.\n\nMobile devices and internet-connected technology have increasingly\n\nproliferated civilian and military organizations. This technique may very\n\nlikely be deployed in the political, government, or non-governmental\n\nsectors in the near future.\n\n1-The name Попр-Д30.apk is an abbreviated variant of Поправки-Д30\n\nwhich translates to Correction-D30.\n\n2-For more information, contact CrowdStrike\n\n3-vKontakte is a Russian social media networking site alike in layout\n\nand functionality to Facebook.\n\n4-http://programs-art.at.ua\n\n5-For more information, contact CrowdStrike\n\n6-Igor Sutyagin, “Russian Forces in Ukraine,” Royal United Services\n\nInstitute, March 2015, https://rusi.org/sites/default/files/201503_bp_\n\nrussian_forces_in_ukraine.pdf\n\n7-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp-7e_ZGH8I\n\n8-Data for image circa 2015.
