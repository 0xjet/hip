    "plain_text": "# Compromised WordPress Sites Used to Distribute the Adwind RAT\n\n**zscaler.com/blogs/research/compromised-wordpress-sites-used-distribute-adwind-rat**\n\n[With more than 60 million websites, including 33.4 percent of the top 10 million global websites, built on the WordPress platform, it is big](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/malicious-javascript-injected-wordpress-sites-using-latest-plugin-vulnerability)\n[news when a new attack aimed at this popular tool surfaces. And, as you can probably guess, the Zscaler ThreatLabZ team recently noticed](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/abuse-hidden-well-known-directory-https-sites)\nanother campaign targeting WordPress sites.\n\nSince the first week of April 2020, we observed several instances of malicious Java archive (JAR) files hosted on compromised WordPress\nwebsites. These JAR files used several layers of encryption to protect its final payload—the Adwind remote access Trojan (RAT).\n\nIn this blog, we describe two aspects of this campaign. In the first part, we describe the intelligence information we gathered from this\ncampaign, which was used for threat attribution. In the second part, we explain in detail all the steps used for decrypting the multiple layers of\nencryption that were used to protect the final payload.\n\n## Compromised sites used for hosting the payload\n\nWe observed a common pattern shared among all the compromised websites in this campaign, which are used to host the malicious JAR\npayload. All these websites used the Content Management System (CMS) from WordPress. Attackers often exploit vulnerabilities in\nWordPress plugins to get access to the admin panel of the CMS. Once the access is obtained, they can host their payload on the server.\n\nThe WordPress version can be confirmed by checking the meta HTML tag in the source code with the “name” attribute field set to “generator”\nas shown below for one of the compromised sites observed in this campaign.\n\n_Figure 1: WordPress version in the HTML source code._\n\nMost of the compromised websites in this campaign were running a fairly recent version of WordPress—5.3.x. Only a few sites were running\noutdated versions, such as 4.5.x or 3.3.x.\n\nThe file names for the payload varied between themes ranging from Coronavirus to payment invoices and shipping delivery services, such as\nDHL and USPS, as shown below:\n\nCovid-19Update.jar\n\nReylontransport-covid19-statement20.jar\n\nRescheduleUSPS.jar\n\nDHLPaket.jar\n\n## Threat attribution\n\nOn some of the compromised WordPress sites used to host the malicious JAR files, we were able to find PHP web shells that attackers used\nto control the web server as shown in Figure 2\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: PHP web shell on a compromised WordPress site._\n\nThere are some other web shells present in the same directory. After inspecting the different web shells, we located a PHP mailer script that\nwould send a test email to attacker-specified email addresses, as shown in Figure 3.\n\n_Figure 3: PHP mailing script found on the compromised server._\n\nEmail addresses:\n\n[[email protected]](https://www.zscaler.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#df8cbebdbaadacbabdada6e6e69fb9adbabab2beb6b3f1b7aa)\n\n[[email protected]](https://www.zscaler.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#530032313621203631212a6a6a13303a27213c3e323a3f7d3b26)\n\n## Technical analysis of the encrypted JAR\n\nThere were multiple layers of encryption used in the JAR files in this campaign, which made it clear that some form of crypting service was\nused by the threat actor to protect the final JAR payload. After decrypting several layers, we found a reference to “Qarallax”, which leads us to\nbelieve that the cryptor used can be attributed to the Qarallax crypt service.\n\nIn this section of the blog, we will go in to the details of the different layers of encryption and how we unpacked them one by one to reveal the\nfinal payload.\n\nFor the purpose of analysis, we have chosen the JAR file with MD5 hash: 0a5f34440389ca860235434eea963465\n\n**Filename of the JAR file: Covid-19Update.jar**\n\n## Decryption: Stage 1\n\nThis JAR file contains two encrypted resources:\n\n\n-----\n\n**esou ce** /c oud/ e update\n\n**Resource: 2: AaxIv/WEPcXKp/UBLah/kCQuJbJn**\n\nThese resources will be loaded and decrypted at runtime. To understand the decryption process, let us look at the source code of rr.class\npresent inside this JAR file. This class file is responsible for loading the above resources and calling the decryption routines. The code section\nis shown in Figure 4 with relevant comments added to the code.\n\n_Figure 4: Code for decrypting the resources in stage 1._\n\nIt is also important to note that the strings referenced in the above code are defined inside the gf.class file. All these strings are encrypted as\nshown in Figure 5.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Encrypted strings in stage 1._\n\nThe string decryption routine is shown in Figure 6.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: String decryption routine in stage 1._\n\nThis string decryption routine was reused in the later stages as well. So we rewrote it in Python to make the decryption process of further\nlayers easier. The code for string decryption is mentioned in the Appendix I section of this blog.\n\nThe different steps involved in decryption in above code are:\n\n1. The resource, “/cloud/file.update” is read using getClass.getResourceAsStream() into a byte array.\n2. This resource is decrypted using the AES key: “Psjduiwo8wosld9O” using the AES block cipher mode: AES/ECB/PKCS5PADDING.\n3. The result of the above decryption is an XML file, which is shown in Figure 7.\n\n\n-----\n\n_gu e_ _e obta ed a te dec ypt o_ _t co ta s t e_ _S ey to dec ypt t e seco d esou ce_\n\n4. This resource is loaded using the loadFromXML() method which allows individual properties from the XML to be accessed to continue the\ndecryption process.\n\n## Decryption: Stage 2\n\nThe XML file, which was obtained after decrypting stage 1, is used to decrypt the second layer as defined below.\n\n1. The SERVER entry in this XML file corresponds to the second encrypted resource called: /AaxIv/WEPcXKp/UBLah/kCQuJbJn.Tje in the\n\nJAR file. The PASSWORD entry in the above XML file corresponds to the AES key, which will be used to decrypt this second resource.\n2. The AES key used for decrypting the second resource is: xslNGppgnJmTwGGH.\n3. Second resource is decrypted to a Gzip file, which gets decompressed to another JAR file.\n\n## Decryption: Stage 3\n\nIn this stage, we will look at the decrypted JAR file obtained from stage 2. The class files and resource file structure for this JAR is as shown\nin Figure 8.\n\n_Figure 8: JAR file structure of stage 3._\n\nThis JAR file has one encrypted resource called “/this/file.grt”.\n\nExecution of this JAR file begins in the method: j2t.ple.IL as shown in Figure 9.\n\n_Figure 9: The main method in stage 3._\n\nThe strings in this method were encrypted using the same string encryption method as in stage 1. The only difference was in the initial one\nbyte XOR key, which was changed to 0x58.\n\n\n-----\n\nte dec ypt g t e st gs t e a et od, e ca see a e e e ce to t e Qa a a p oject Qa a a p o des c ypt g se ces o\nencrypting JAR files on underground hacking forums, leading us to correlate this to Qarallax.\n\nNow let us look at the method, Il() defined in il_1.class file. This method performs the resource decryption as shown in Figure 10.\n\n_Figure 10: Code for performing decryption of resources in stage 3._\n\nThe different steps involved in the decryption are:\n\n1. It loads the encrypted resource: “/this/file.grt” using getClass.getResourceAsStream() into a byte array.\n2. It uses the DES key: R5uE7enKM8wK0qOk8s9di to decrypt the above resource.\n3. The result of decryption is an XML file as shown in Figure 11.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11: The XML file after decryption in stage 3._\n\n4. The SERVER_BIN file in the above decrypted XML corresponds to the next stage encrypted file. PASSWORD_CRYPTED corresponds to\nan encrypted AES key, which will be used to decrypt the SERVER_BIN file. PRIVATE_PASSWORD is the RSA private key, which is used to\ndecrypt the AES key.\n\n5. Each of the above properties are loaded from the XML using loadFromXML() and getProperty() methods.\n\n6. The RSA private key is stored as a serialized Java object. It is unserialized using the readObject() method.\n\n7. The unserialized RSA key is used to decrypt the AES key defined in the PASSWORD_CRYPTED section of the XML.\n\n8. The decrypted AES key is used to decrypt the SERVER_BIN file, which results in the next stage decrypted file.\n\n## Decryption: Stage 4\n\nThe decrypted payload obtained from stage 3 is the final JAR payload, which was protected with multiple layers of encryption. The JAR class\nfile structure for this payload is as shown in Figure 12.\n\n\n-----\n\n_gu e_ _e J_ _e st uctu e_ _stage_\n\nThis file contains multiple encrypted resources.\n\nKey1.json – RSA private key stored as a serialized Java object.\n\nKey2.json – Encrypted AES key.\n\nConfig.json – Encrypted config file of the Java RAT.\n\nLet us look at the main method—server.main.Start()—of this JAR file. We can see the use of encrypted strings in this JAR file as shown in\nFigure 13.\n\n_Figure 13: The encrypted strings in stage 4._\n\nFigure 14 shows the string decryption routine.\n\n_Figure 14: The string decryption routine in stage 4._\n\nThis string decryption routine is different from the previous stages we analyzed. It is a variant of XOR decryption, which derives the decryption\nkey in an interesting way.\n\nThe first two lines of the decryption routine are:\n\nStackTraceElement stackTraceElement = new LinkageError().getStackTrace()[1];\n\nString string = new StringBuffer(stackTraceElement.getClassName()).append(stackTraceElement.getMethodName()).toString();\n\nThese lines are used to fetch the class name and the method name from which the string decryption routine was called. To find the calling\nclass name and method name, it generates an exception using LinkageError() and then fetches the first stack frame using getStackTrace()[1].\nFrom this stack frame, the calling class name and method name are derived.\n\n\n-----\n\ns a e a p e, e t e st g dec ypt o out e s ca ed by t e et od t e c ass Sta t, t e t e O dec ypt o ey be\n\"Startii\".\n\nUpon further analysis, we discovered that this string decryption routine is the same as the one provided by the Java obfuscator called Allatori.\nUsually class files obfuscated with Allatori obfuscator use the method name: ALLATORIxDEMOxhthr().\n\nHowever, in this case, the method name was also obfuscated to remove any reference to Allatori.\n\nWe rewrote the string decryption routine in Python to decrypt all the strings in this JAR file. The Python script is provided in the Appendix II\nsection of this blog.\n\nAfter decrypting the strings, the resulting code is shown in Figure 15.\n\n_Figure 15: The code after decrypting the strings._\n\n## Decryption of the config file\n\nAs a first step, we will decrypt the resources to get access to the config file. The steps involved in decryption are:\n\n1. Loads the serialized object from the resource: “/server/resources/Key1.json” using getClass.getResourceAsStream().\n2. Unserializes the Java object using readObject() to get access to the RSA private key.\n3. Loads the encrypted AES key from the resource called: \"/server/resources/Key2.json\".\n4. Loads the encrypted config file from the resource called: “/server/resources/config.json\".\n5. Decrypts the AES key using the RSA private key.\n6. Decrypts the encrypted resource using the decrypted AES key.\n\nThe resulting decrypted config file is as shown below.\n\n{\"securityRetry\":20,\"vbox\":true,\"security\":[],\"nickName\":\"quarantoes\",\"installation\":\n{\"jarName\":\"aDaGm\",\"moduleFolder\":\"pWnmd\",\"moduleEntry\":\"tUjeninoYOKbbABjEQOfwMmkkAV/iPYMlXQvBnHKdoBEfaulmhiFQGfShHjNdiXU\n\n[{\"delay\":2,\"port\":9932,\"dns\":\"212.114.52.236\"}]}\n\nWe provide a description of the key fields present in the above configuration file.\n\n**Vbox: Indicates whether the presence of VirtualBox should be checked or not.**\n\n**nickName: This is a unique identifier used while building the RAT. In our case, it is “quarantoes”.**\n\n**Installation: A JSON that contains key-value pairs describing the location where the JAR file needs to be copied to on the file system.**\n\n**jreFolder: Indicates the folder where all the files required for running the JAR are stored.**\n\n**jarRegistry: The name of the Windows registry key used for persistence.**\n\n**delay: Indicates the number of seconds to delay the execution.**\n\n**Vmware: Indicates whether the presence of VMWare should be checked or not.**\n\n**Port: The port number on which the RAT communicates with the server.**\n\n**DNS: IP address of the callback server.**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Activities performed by the RAT\n\nBelow are the main activities performed by the RAT.\n\n1. It checks the OS name and if it is not Windows, then the RAT does not execute.\n\n2. It copies itself to the path: C:\\Users\\user\\pMbbW\\aDaGm.class. The directory name in this path is selected from the “mainFolder”\n\nparameter of the config file and the filename is selected using the “jarName” parameter in the config file. The file extension for the JAR\nfile is selected as “.class” based on the configured value for parameter: “jarExtension” in the config file.\n3. It sets the Windows registry key for persistence to ensure that the above JAR file is executed automatically using javaw.exe upon\n\nreboot.\n\n**Key path: HKEY_USERS\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run**\n\n**Key name: UKikhtn**\n\n**Key value: \"C:\\Users\\user\\Oracle\\bin\\javaw.exe\" -jar \"C:\\Users\\user\\pMbbW\\aDaGm.class\"**\n\nThe key name is fetched from the config file as well.\n\n1. It loads the DLL from the resource section: “/server/resources” based on the system architecture. For 32-bit system, it loads x86.dll and\n\nfor 64-bit system, it loads amd64.dll.\n\nThis DLL will be loaded and copied to a temporary location on the file system with the file extension, “.xml”. The DLL is then loaded using the\nSystem.load() command as shown in Figure 16.\n\n_Figure 16: The code for loading the DLL._\n\n5. It checks the value of the “active” key in the decrypted config.json file. If the value is set to true, then the RAT delays the execution by the\n“delay” number of seconds as configured in the config.json file.\n\n6. It checks for the presence of a virtualization environment, such as VMWare, Virtualbox and Qemu. If it finds the presence of such an\nenvironment, then it exits the execution.\n\nWe will not be describing the functionality of this binary in detail in this blog since the final payload is a well-known jRAT (Java-based RAT).\n\n## Cloud Sandbox Detection\n\n[Figure 17 shows the Zscaler Cloud Sandbox successfully detecting this JAR-based threat.](https://www.zscaler.com/products/sandboxing)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17: Zscaler Cloud Sandbox detection._\n\nIn addition to sandbox detections, Zscaler’s multilayered cloud security platform detects indicators at various levels, as seen here:\n[Java.Backdoor.Adwind.](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=Java.Backdoor.Adwind)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis threat actor leverages compromised websites to serve heavily encrypted variants of a Java-based RAT, which makes the detection\ndifficult over the network.\n\nAs an extra precaution, users should not run JAR files from untrusted and unknown sources since JAR files contain executable code and\nhave the capability of infecting a system.\n\nWeb administrators who use WordPress installations should ensure that they are running the latest version of WordPress plugins and themes\nto prevent any vulnerability from being exploited.\n\nThe Zscaler ThreatLabZ team will continue to monitor this campaign, as well as others, to help keep our customers safe.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK TTP Mapping\n\n**Tactic** **Technique**\n\nPersistence Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder - T1060\n\nObfuscation Obfuscated Files or Information - T1027\n\nSoftware Packing T1045\n\nProcess Discovery Query and kill system processes - T1057\n\nSecurity Software Discovery T1063\n\nSystem Information Discovery T1082\n\nSystem Network Configuration Discovery T1016\n\nWindows Management Instrumentation T1047\n\n\n-----\n\nUncommonly Used Port T1065\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOC)\n\n**URLs hosting JAR files**\n\nhxxp://haus-pesjak[.]at/Covid-19Update.jar\n\nhxxps://digitaltextile.com[.]ru/lk/Deutsche%20Telekom.jar\n\nhxxps://digitaltextile.com[.]ru/n/DHL%20paket.jar\n\nhxxp://haus-pesjak[.]at/04-07-20Intuitinvoices.jar\n\nhxxp://teddyshatsworld[.]pl/Reylontransport-covid19-statement20.jar\n\nhxxp://thaivictory.co[.]th/pageconfig/album/dir/5/order.jar\n\nhxxp://cherryemoore[.]com/USPS/RedeliveryUSPS.jar\n\nhxxps://feylibertad[.]org/Amazon-PO20023938.jar\n\nhxxp://mahalowood[.]com/USPS/USPSReschedulerLabel.jar\n\nhxxps://newsha.jsonland[.]ir/wp-includes/css/DHLPaket.jar\n\nhxxps://www.stillval[.]com/USPS/RescheduleUSPS.jar\n\nhxxps://thediscoveryrun[.]com/UPS/ShippingInfo.jar\n\nhxxp://jeddahcrumbly[.]com/DHLPAKET.jar\n\nhxxps://dev.medialogistics2020[.]ca/wp-content/plugins/ubh/Quickbooks-INV5066.jar\n\n**Hashes of the samples**\n\n7e4bdf62d3ecd78b3f407f6ec1158678\n\n0a5f34440389ca860235434eea963465\n\n1da18ec639f7ec2a8aad58655d846e23\n\nd7489b47e17630e5594a320b43b201db\n\nda52c24302a03626d2175123b751f466\n\nb766cf6695730b74a107cb73157262b1\n\n919f2d0043f063a90702fb36887699e8\n\nd470d5a428f99818278fb2816a8d03e9\n\n8f5e55fbb1bee93dc5912dcbd0092519\n\n4a97b2d004d72b69aa64f621b5b74775\n\n051b4da1f0079c6f60d6c8eb62b3f586\n\n2020551b5373121053abdbf3eaafa02d\n\na4da22e269b93148eb9857036b9a072a\n\n876eb4208ef2eec6e9f12b13f764a975\n\n1d77e96974e1e2301ed78cec19e8710b\n\n**Network Indicators**\n\n212.114.52[.]236:9932\n\nunks123.duckdns[.]org:46865\n\n\n-----\n\nay dubya[ ]us 8 8\n\nfresh.ygto[.]com:1010\n\ngwiza1988.hopto[.]org:6025\n\npraisesalways.ddns[.]net:1010\n\nwawa.cleansite[.]us:1010\n\ndlee889.mywire[.]org:5858\n\n**Appendix I**\n\n**String decryption routine**\n\n#!
