One thing about this malware stood out: the subdirectory used in the access\npanel URL. It contained the string “***=**U=TEAM” (which we have obfuscated). Our\ninvestigations lead us to believe this may be a case of industrial espionage.\n\nThe actors use compromised websites to host their access panels. Luckily for us they made\na mistake and left the ZIP file they dropped on the compromised site.\n\nThis enabled us to see how the back-end of the panel works. The Zip file contains five files:\n\nThe three files of interest are config.php, index.php, and install.php.\n\nConfig.php contains the password for the MySQL server they will set up.\n\n\n-----\n\nInstall.php creates the database and sets up the panel to store the passwords stolen by the\nmalware. We found the following snippet in the code:\n\nWe did some searching and found that “Bilal Ghouri” was originally responsible for the PHP\nback-end of the popular PWS Hackhound Stealer, which was released in 2009.\n\nWe also found this warning at the end of the code:\n\nSurely they would have remembered to delete this file!\n\nThe most important file is index.php. This file is responsible for storing the passwords\nuploaded by the malware and also enables the actors to search and export the data.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is interesting that the script checks for a specific user agent, “HardCore Software For :\nPublic.”\n\nThis user agent is used by the malware when uploading the stolen data. The PHP script\nchecks if the user agent matches the hardcoded one before allowing any data to be\nuploaded.\n\nThe malware in use is ISR Stealer, a modified version of Hackhound Stealer. Our findings\nare confirmed by the comments in the preceding PHP code.\n\nThe PWS targets the following applications:\n\nInternet Explorer\nFirefox\nChrome\nOpera\nSafari\nYahoo Messenger\nMSN Messenger\nPidgin\nFileZilla\nInternet Download Manager\nJDownloader\n\n\n-----\n\nTrillian\n\nThe following screen of the original Hackhound Stealer shows options for building the\nmalware:\n\nThis screen of the ISR Stealer builder was used by the actors behind the campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nISR Stealer uses two executables to gather passwords stored on the machine: Mail\nPassView and WebBrowserPassView, both by Nirsoft. These apps gather passwords stored\nin mail clients and web browsers. Both of these files reside in the resources of the ISR\nStealer. The panel location is also stored in the malware’s resources, in a simple encrypted\nform with SUB 0x02.\n\n_An encrypted URL._\n\n_A decrypted URL._\n\nWe did some more digging and found that the actors responsible for this malware have been\nactive since the beginning of 2016, with the first sample spotted in the wild in January.\n\nThe following spear-phishing emails were sent to entice targets to download and execute the\nPWS:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe actors have been busy for several weeks, although we saw no activity during the Easter\nholiday. After “Easter break,” we noticed that they had slightly changed the panel. It now\nincludes the string “Powered By NEW LINE OF *** **U TEAMS VERSION 2.1.”\n\n\n-----\n\nOne compromised website had more than 10 access panels receiving stolen passwords from\nthe PWS. We observed that some of the targets of the spear phishing are companies\nthat deal with machinery parts. The actors used some of the following filenames:\n\n(RFQ__1045667machine-oil valves).exe\nButterflyCheckVALVES.exe\nBALL VALVE BIDDING.exe\nRFQ BALL VALVE.exe\nBall Valves with BSPP conection.exe\n\nThese names lead us to believe that industrial espionage might be a motive of the actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have also noticed that they are attaching the malware with a “.z” extension. This is likely\nbecause some popular ZIP file handlers will associate this file extension with their programs\nand allow users to extract it. Using .z also bypasses some popular cloud email file\nrestrictions.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe contacted the website owners used by the actors and informed them of the compromise\nso that they could remove the panels.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nMcAfee detects this threat as PWS-FCGH. We advise you block .z file extensions at the\ngateway level. This step will prevent other malware from using this technique in their\nphishing campaigns.\n\n[Oliver Devane Research Scientist](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/author/oliver-devane/)\nOliver Devane is currently a Senior Security Researcher at McAfee.
