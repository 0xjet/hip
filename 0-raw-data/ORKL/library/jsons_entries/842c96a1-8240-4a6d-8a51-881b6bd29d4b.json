The malware families used in this campaign consisted\nmainly of malicious documents featuring CARROTBAT downloaders with SYSCON payloads, but also included a new malware downloader\nUnit 42 has dubbed CARROTBALL.\n\nCARROTBALL, initially discovered in an attack during October 2019, is a simple FTP downloader utility which facilitates the installation of\nSYSCON, a full-featured Remote Access Trojan (RAT) which leverages FTP for Command and Control (C2). It was found embedded in a\nmalicious Word document sent as a phishing lure to a US government agency and two non-US foreign nationals professionally associated with\nNorth Korea.\n\nThroughout the course of the campaign, Unit 42 ultimately observed a total of six unique malicious document lures being sent as attachments\nfrom four unique Russian email addresses to 10 unique targets. The subject matter of the lures featured articles written in Russian pertaining\nto ongoing geopolitical relations issues surrounding North Korea. Of those malicious documents, five contained CARROTBAT downloaders,\nand one contained a CARROTBALL downloader. All malicious second stage payloads were SYSCON.\n\nWhile this campaign does demonstrate some evolution in the actor’s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) with the use of a new\ndownloader family and new malicious code in the form of Word Document macros, the majority of its attributes bear a strong resemblance to\n[the Fractured Block campaign previously reported by Unit 42 in November 2018. As such, Unit 42 has dubbed this campaign Fractured Statue.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-the-fractured-block-campaign-carrotbat-malware-used-to-deliver-malware-targeting-southeast-asia/)\n[The Adversary Playbook for the activity described in this blog can be found here.](https://pan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/?pb=konni)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Fractured Statue Campaign Timeline_\n\n### Opening Wave of Attacks\n\nBetween July 15th, 2019 and July 17th, 2019, spear phishing emails were sent to a total of five individuals at a US government agency from\nthe email addresses 0tdelkorei@mail[.]ru and kargarnova@mail[.]ru. The spear phishing emails utilized three different email subjects with\nmalicious macro documents attached with the same name; all file names were written in Russian. Further, all of the malicious documents\ncontained articles written in Russian pertaining to ongoing geopolitical relations issues surrounding North Korea. The documents themselves\nwere rather generic and had no embedded image enticements to enable macros. They did, however, leverage second-stage downloader\ncomponents consistent with known CARROTBAT samples, and almost all of them featured SYSCON payloads. The first pages of each of\nthese documents are shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2.

Also of note is that the lure in this attack did\nfeature a more traditional “enable macro” cover page, but was then followed by additional pages in Russian that thematically matched with the\ndocuments found in the rest of the campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7.

Macro from malicious documents associated with CARROTBAT._\n\nWhen executed, this code will:\n\nDetermine whether the victim’s host machine is running Windows with an x86 or x64 architecture.\nParse the contents of a corresponding textbox within the document and convert it to a command line argument specific to the Windows\narchitecture on the victim’s machine.\nExecute the command.\nClear the contents of the textboxes and save the document.\n\nAs previously mentioned, all samples featuring the macros above also featured CARROTBAT as a second stage downloader.\n\nThe October 2019 attack, however, differed significantly from the previous ones. Instead of reading from the contents of the document itself,\nthe macros leveraged an embedded Windows executable in the form of hex bytes delimited via the ‘|’ character that ultimately acted as a\ndropper. When the macro was executed, the hex bytes were split, converted to binary, and dropped onto disk as an executable. The first few\nlines of this functionality are shown below:\n\n_Figure 9. Macro from malicious documents associated with CARROTBALL._\n\nIn this case, the dropped binary was a new type of downloader we have dubbed CARROTBALL. Its sole purpose was to serve as the main\nmechanism to facilitate the download and installation of the SYSCON backdoor. This is very similar to the CARROTBAT samples observed\n[earlier on in this campaign and in the previous Fractured Block campaign (see technical analysis here). Additionally, of novel interest in this](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-the-fractured-block-campaign-carrotbat-malware-used-to-deliver-malware-targeting-southeast-asia/)\nattack was the use of two separate FTP credential pairs to conduct active C2 operations. One credential pair was hardcoded in the dropped\nCARROTBALL binary and used to connect to the domain downplease.c1[.]biz to retrieve a CAB file renamed with a generic .dat extension.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. Observed CARROTBALL FTP interaction._\n\nWhen extracted, the .cab file was found to contain two malicious batch files, two malicious dlls (one of which contained a custom base64\nalphabet), and a second domain (lookplease.c1[.]biz) with a set of FTP login credentials encoded in the custom base64 alphabet. The contents\nof the cab file are as follows:\n\n_Figure 11.

However, as additional campaigns began to appear with strongly overlapping TTPs yet did not feature the Konni RAT, specifically,\nsome industry researchers simply began to adopt the “Konni” moniker to refer to the actors behind the aggregated set of activity. Unit 42 has\nfollowed this trend, and now refers to the “Konni Group” as such.\n\n**Konni’s Ties to Fractured Statue**\n\n[As prominently documented by Cisco Talos, the first Konni Group activity was a sustained information stealing/RAT distribution campaign](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/05/konni-malware-under-radar-for-years.html)\nspanning between 2014 and 2017. Throughout 2018, Unit 42 released several blogs on Konni Group activity, and subsequently identified two\n[new malware families the group was using in the attacks, dubbed NOKKI and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-new-konni-malware-attacking-eurasia-southeast-asia/) [CARROTBAT, respectively. Now, in 2019, Unit 42’s continued](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-the-fractured-block-campaign-carrotbat-malware-used-to-deliver-malware-targeting-southeast-asia/)\nobservation of targeted CARROTBAT activity (in addition to the new malware CARROTBALL being used during the same campaign) could\nindicate that both are still in use by the Konni Group, as thematically linked elements of Konni Group TTPs include:\n\nTargeting individuals/organizations who have interest in, are directly linked to, or conduct business in North Korea (corroborated by\nprevious research by Unit 42).\nUtilizing malicious document phishing lures containing subject matter pertaining to North Korea (corroborated by previous research by\nUnit 42).\nIteratively increasing the type and complexity of their payload delivery mechanisms (from their initial use of simple Base64 strings as\nreported by Trend Micro, then later leveraging CARROTBAT, and now leveraging CARROTBALL)\n\nHowever, there are non-trivial obstacles to obtaining a high-confidence attribution to the Konni Group, namely the fact that previous blogs\nproduced by Unit 42 and other researchers contain a great deal of technical detail about the group’s operations, and copycat actors may\nattempt to emulate previously observed TTPs to hinder attribution efforts or perform false-flag operations.\n\nIn light of these factors, Unit 42 assesses with moderate confidence that this activity is related to the Konni Group.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOverall, the Fractured Statue campaign provides clear evidence that the TTPS discovered in Fractured Block are still relevant, and that the\ngroup behind the attacks still appears to be active. Additionally, development and use of the new downloader, CARROTBALL, alongside the\nmore commonly observed malware delivery mechanism, CARROTBAT, may indicate that the previous methods employed by the group to\n[successfully infect their targets are becoming less effective.
