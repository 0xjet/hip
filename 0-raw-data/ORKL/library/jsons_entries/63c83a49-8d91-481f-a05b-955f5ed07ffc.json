    "plain_text": "# Sea Turtle keeps on swimming, finds new victims, DNS hijacking techniques\n\n**[blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/07/sea-turtle-keeps-on-swimming.html](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/07/sea-turtle-keeps-on-swimming.html)**\n\n_By_ _[Danny Adamitis with contributions from Paul Rascagneres.](https://twitter.com/dadamitis)_\n\n## Executive summary\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter several months of activity, the actors behind the [Sea Turtle DNS hijacking campaign](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/04/seaturtle.html)\nare not slowing down. Cisco Talos recently discovered new details that suggest they\nregrouped after we published our initial findings and coverage and are redoubling their\nefforts with new infrastructure. While many actors will slow down once they are discovered,\nthis group appears to be unusually brazen, and will be unlikely to be deterred going forward.\n\nAdditionally, we discovered a new DNS hijacking technique that we assess with moderate\nconfidence is connected to the actors behind Sea Turtle. This new technique is similar in that\nthe threat actors compromise the name server records and respond to DNS requests with\nfalsified A records. This new technique has only been observed in a few highly targeted\noperations. We also identified a new wave of victims, including a country code top-level\ndomain (ccTLD) registry, which manages the DNS records for every domain uses that\nparticular country code, that access was used to then compromise additional government\nentities. Unfortunately, unless there are significant changes made to better secure DNS,\nthese sorts of attacks are going to remain prevalent.\n\n## New DNS hijacking technique\n\nTalos now has moderate confidence that the threat actors behind Sea Turtle have been using\nanother DNS hijacking technique. This new technique has been used very sparingly, and\nthus far have only identified two entities that were targeted in 2018, though we believe there\nare likely more.\n\nThis new technique once again involved modifying the target domain's name server records\nto point legitimate users to the actor-controlled server. In this case, the actor-controlled name\nserver and the hijacked hostnames would both resolve to the same IP address for a short\nperiod of time, typically less than 24 hours. In both observed cases, one of the hijacked\nhostnames would reference an email service and the threat actors would presumably harvest\nuser credentials. One aspect of this technique that makes it extremely difficult to track is that\nthe actor-controlled name servers were not used across multiple targets — meaning that\nevery entity hijacked with this technique had its own dedicated name server hostname and\nits own dedicated IP address. Whereas previously reported name server domains such as\nns1[.]intersecdns[.]com were used to target multiple organizations.\n\nIn one case, a private organization primarily used a third-party service as their authoritative\nname server. Then, for a three-hour window in January 2018, their name server records\nwere changed to a name server hostname that mimicked a slightly different version of the\norganization's name. During that three-hour window, the actor-controlled IP address hosted\nthree hostnames, the two actor-controlled name servers and the webmail hostname. This\nwould allow the threat actors to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, as outlined in our\nprevious post, and harvest credentials. This technique was also observed against a\ngovernment organizations in the Middle East and North African region.\n\n## Continued activity against ccTLD\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Institute of Computer Science of the Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas\n[(ICS-Forth), the ccTLD for Greece, acknowledged on its public website that its network had](https://techblog.gr/internet/kyvernoepithesi-ypesti-to-mitroo-onomaton-internet-katalixi-gr-el/)\nbeen compromised on April 19, 2019. Based on Cisco telemetry, we determined that the\nactors behind the Sea Turtle campaign had access to the ICS-Forth network.\n\nCisco telemetry confirmed that the actors behind Sea Turtle maintained access to the ICSForth network from an operational command and control (C2) node. Our telemetry indicates\nthat the actors maintained access in the ICS-Forth network through at least April 24, five\ndays after the statement was publicly released. Upon analysis of this operational C2 node,\nwe determined that it was also used to access an organization in Syria that was previously\nredirected using the actor-controlled name server ns1[.]intersecdns[.]com. This indicates that\nthe same threat actors were behind both operations.\n\n[We also saw evidence that the threat actors researched the open-source tool PHP-Proxy.](https://www.php-proxy.com/)\nNotably, this particular C2 node searched for both blog.talosintelligence.com and\nncsc.gov.uk, presumably to view Talos' previous reports on DNS hijacking and this DNS\nhijacking advisory from the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre.\n\n## New actor-controlled nameserver\n\nWe recently discovered a new actor-controlled nameserver, rootdnservers[.]com, that\nexhibited similar behavior patterns as name servers previously utilized as part of the Sea\nTurtle campaign. The domain rootdnservers[.]com was registered on April 5, 2019 through\nthe registrar NameCheap. The new actor-controlled name server rootdnservers[.]com was\nutilized to perform DNS hijacking against three government entities that all used .gr, the\nGreek ccTLD. It's likely that these hijackings were performed through the access the threat\nactors obtained in the ICS-Forth network. Below is a table showing the three most recent\nactor-controlled name servers that we have associated with this activity and their current\noperational status.\n\n**Hostnames** **IP addresses** **Operational Status**\n\nns1[.]rootdnservers[.]com. 45[.]32[.]100[.]62 Active\n\nns2[.]rootdnservers[.]com. 45[.]32[.]100[.]62 Active\n\nns1[.]intersecdns[.]com 95[.]179[.]150[.]101 Inactive\n\nns2[.]intersecdns[.]com 95[.]179[.]150[.]101 Inactive\n\n## New IP addresses associated with man-in-the-middle activity\n\nBy identifying the targeted domains, we were able to identify the hijacked hostnames and the\ncorresponding actor-controlled MitM nodes The threat actors again employing previously\n\n\n-----\n\ndocumented tradecraft, by performing a certificate impersonation technique. This is where\nthe threat actors procure an SSL certificate for the targeted hostname from a different SSL\nprovider. Below is a table showing the dates and associated IP addresses.\n\n**Date** **IP address**\n\nApril 13, 2019 95[.]179[.]131[.]225\n\nApril 16, 2019 95[.]179[.]131[.]225\n\nApril 11, 2019 95[.]179[.]131[.]225\n\nApril 11, 2019 140[.]82[.]58[.]253\n\nApril 10, 2019 95[.]179[.]156[.]61\n\n## Updated victimology\n\nSince our initial report, Sea Turtle has continued to compromise a number of different entities\nto fulfill their requirements. We have identified some of the new primary targets as:\n\nGovernment organizations\nEnergy companies\nThink tanks\nInternational non-governmental organizations\nAt least one airport\n\nIn terms of secondary targets, we have seen very similar targets as those previously\nreported, such as telecommunications providers, internet service providers and one registry.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Coverage and mitigations\n\nIn order to best protect against this type of attack, we compiled a list of potential actions. We\nhave included additional security recommendations, that were highlighted by Bill Woodcock\n[during his presentations on DNS/IMAP attacks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNF6TE75mzg)\n\nWe recommend implementing multi-factor authentication, such as DUO, to secure the\nmanagement of your organization's DNS records at your registrar, and to connect\nremotely to your corporate network via a Virtual Private Network (VPN).\nTalos suggests a registry lock service on your domain names, which will require the\nregistrar to provide an out-of-band confirmation before the registry will process any\nchanges to an organization's DNS record.\nDNSSEC sign your domains, either in-house, or using a DNS service provider which\nperforms DNSSEC key-management services.\nDNSSEC validate all DNS lookups in your recursive resolver, either using in-house\nnameservers, or a service like Cisco Umbrella / OpenDNS.\nMake Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) email servers accessible only from\nyour corporate LAN and to users who have already authenticated over a VPN.\nIf you suspect you were targeted by this type of activity, we recommend instituting a\nnetwork-wide password reset, preferably from a computer on a trusted network.\nLastly, network administrators can monitor passive DNS record on their domains, to\ncheck for abnormalities.\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\n**IP address** **Characterization** **Date Range**\n\n185[.]64[.]105[.]100 Operational Node March - April 2019\n\n178[.]17[.]167[.]51 Operational Node June 2019\n\n95[.]179[.]131[.]225 Mitm Node April 2019\n\n140[.]82[.]58[.]253 Mitm Node April 2019\n\n95[.]179[.]156[.]61 Mitm Node April 2019\n\n196[.]29[.]187[.]100 Mitm Node December 2018\n\n188[.]226[.]192[.]35 Mitm Node January 2018\n\nns1[.]rootdnservers[.]com Actor-controlled nameserver April 2019\n\nns2[.]rootdnservers[.]com Actor-controlled nameserver April 2019\n\n45[.]32[.]100[.]62 Hosted malicious nameserver April 2019\n\n\n-----\n\nns1[.]intersecdns[.]com Actor-controlled nameserver February - April 2019\n\nns2[.]intersecdns[.]com Actor-controlled nameserver February - April 2019\n\n95[.]179[.]150[.]101 Hosted malicious nameserver February - July 2019\n\n\n-----",
