Using our global visibility, we have determined that while Emotet has not yet\nattained the same scale it once had, the botnet is showing a strong resurgence with a total of\napproximately 130,000 unique bots spread across 179 countries since November 2021. This\ngrowing pool of bots presents a looming threat to organizations around the world; Emotet\nbots serve to not only propagate the malware by spamming targets through legitimate mail\nservers using stolen credentials, but they also serve as footholds for lateral movement in\ncoveted networks and could be promoted to act as proxy C2s\n\n\n-----\n\n### Introduction\n\nEmotet is widely considered one of the world’s most dangerous global malware families due\nto its role in gaining initial access to infected machines and then selling that access to other\ncybercriminals, such as ransomware operators. When we first reported on Emotet a few\n[years ago, we focused on its unique tiering structure and how the complex architecture both](https://blog.lumen.com/emotet-illuminated-mapping-a-tiered-botnet-using-global-network-forensics/)\nenabled resiliency against individual C2 disruptions and provided a successful malware\ndistribution framework to rent out as a service to other actors and ransomware operators. We\nexplored how network telemetry revealed that some infected Windows devices or bots were\npromoted via a UPnP module to serve as proxy C2s, forwarding communications from newly\ninfected devices to threat actor-controlled infrastructure. We used Lumen’s global backbone\nvisibility to plot out the distinct clusters of C2s known as Epochs 1 and 2, and we determined\nthat only the Bot C2s were communicating with other malware families such as TrickBot,\nIcedID, Qakbot, Dridex and others. At the time, we identified, on average, 40,000 unique\nEmotet bots daily and tracked more than 300 unique Emotet C2s in a given month.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus in summer of 2019, Emotet [came back full swing with a new set of bots](https://twitter.com/blacklotuslabs/status/1164648560933199872)\nand C2s added to its arsenal (Epoch 3). After an active couple of years, Emotet was taken\n[offline by law enforcement in January 2021, only to resurface late last year with some initial](https://www.zdnet.com/article/emotet-once-the-worlds-most-dangerous-malware-is-back/#:~:text=The%20Emotet%20botnet%20has%20returned,with%20TrickBot%2C%20warn%20security%20researchers.)\nhelp from TrickBot.\n\nSince that time, the infosec community has been closely monitoring its return, with numerous\norganizations reporting new functions and changes in the infection methodology. It is evident\nfrom early reporting and substantial recent spamming activity that Emotet’s return warrants\nattention. But how mature is the new version of Emotet? Does it rival its predecessor? Black\nLotus Labs’ analysis reveals that while Emotet’s C2 infrastructure was reestablished in\nNovember, the aggregation of bots really didn’t begin in earnest until January. And while the\ncurrent daily unique bot count is smaller than that of Emotet in its heyday, the number is\nsteadily increasing. The scale of the new bot infrastructure coincides with some notable\ndifferences in the tiering structure and geographic distribution this time around.\n\n### Technical Details\n\n**New Functions**\n\nAs other threat intel intelligence teams have noted, the new Emotet exhibits a few notable\n[changes in how it functions, including, the algorithm it uses to encrypt network traffic and the](https://intel471.com/blog/emotet-returns-december-2021)\nseparation of the process list into its own module.\n\nWhile the previous version of Emotet used the RSA encryption scheme with a single key to\nencrypt and validate network traffic, the new version employs elliptic curve cryptography\n(ECC), with a public key to perform the encryption and a separate algorithm to perform data\nvalidation.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the prior version of Emotet, the list of running process on the infected computer was sent\nto the C2 along with the initial beacon. In the new version, a process list module is sent to\nthe infected machine after it first checks in with the C2. Initially, the new process module\nwould only send the list of running processes. However, the operators recently added\nfunctionality to gather additional information about the infected host, demonstrating the\nongoing evolution of Emotet’s code.\n\nFigure 1: Excerpts from Emotet communication from bot to Tier 1 C2 showing header,\nprocess list and system information\n\n**Global Distribution of C2s**\n\nWhile Black Lotus Labs tracked more than 300 unique Emotet C2s in May of 2019, the\nnumber of unique C2s in the roughly four months since the resurgence is roughly 200. As\nFigure 2 reflects, when Emotet came back online in November 2021, it did so with a smaller,\nbut relatively consistent pool of Tier 1 C2s. Over the last few months, the C2 pool has\ncontinued to grow to an average of 77 unique Tier 1 C2s per day from late February through\nMarch 4.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Daily active unique Emotet Tier 1 C2s November 2021 – March 4, 2022\n\nThe global distribution of Tier 1 Emotet C2s today, depicted in Figure 3, has some similarities\nwith our earlier reporting on Emotet’s prior Tier 1 C2 infrastructure: Emotet C2s are once\nagain predominently located in the United States and Germany. The rest of the list of top 10\ncountries by volume of C2s includes (in order of prevalence): France, Brazil, Thailand,\nSingapore, Indonesia, Canda, United Kingdom and India. The average number of days an\nEmotet Tier 1 C2 is active currently stands at 29 since the resurgence. However, as the\nbotnet once again becomes more established, that figure may change; the average active\ndays of an Emotet C2 in 2019 was 38.\n\nFigure 3: Emotet global Tier 1 C2 distribution as of March 4, 2022\n\n**Change in Tiering Model**\n\nOne core difference in the architecture of Emotet today is the apparent absence of Bot C2s.\nIn the earlier version of Emotet, a subset of bots would receive a UPnP module that enabled\nan infected device to act as a C2 by opening a port on the user’s router that would then allow\n\n\n-----\n\nit to proxy traffic from Emotet bots to a higher-tier C2. These Bot C2s, which represented as\nmuch as 80% of the Emotet C2s we reported at the time, were the only C2s that appeared to\ncommunicate with other malware families.\n\nHowever, to date, Black Lotus Labs has not observed new Emotet bots being infected with\nthe UPnP module or exhibiting proxy communications with Tier 1 C2s. It remains to be seen\nwhether the lack of Bot C2s is a permanent shift, or just an effect of Emotet’s rebuilding\nphase that may yet include reestablishing Bot C2s in the future.\n\n**Global Distribution of Bots**\n\nWhile Emotet’s new C2 infrastructure exhibited a steady base beginning in November, it took\na few months before a sizable pool of bots was reestablished. Figure 4 illustrates the relative\nlack of Emotet bots until a notable uptick beginning in mid-January 2022. The weekly\ncadence of fluxuations in the number of new Emotet bots from January through the time of\nthis report mimic those we saw for Emotet back in 2019.\n\nFigure 4: Daily active unique Emotet bots November 2021 – March 4, 2022\n\nAs depicted in Figure 5, Emotet bots today show a heavy distribution in Asia, namely Japan,\nIndia, Indonesia and Thailand. This is not surprising given the preponderance of vulnerable\nor outdated Windows hosts in the region. The remaining top 10 countries by volume of\nEmotet bots includes (in order): South Africa, Mexico, the United States, China, Brazil and\nItaly.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Emotet global bot distribution as of March 4, 2022\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe growth and distribution of bots is an important indicator of Emotet’s progress in restoring\nits once sprawling infrastructure. Each bot is a potential foothold to a coveted network and\npresents an opportunity to deploy Cobalt Strike or eventually be promoted to a Bot C2.\n\nWhile other organizations can characterize the nature of the C2 nodes through analysis of\nthe bot infection vector via malware samples, the Black Lotus Labs reputation system tracks\nboth Emotet’s C2 infrastructure and its bots. This intelligence feeds the Lumen security\nservices portfolio to help protect customers from interacting with known or suspected\nmalicious infrastructure.\n\nBecause Emotet is primarily spread through malicious email attachments and embedded\n[URLs, we advise Lumen customers to bolster defenses against phishing as an initial access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/)\nvector through full monitoring of network resources, ensuring proper patch management and\nconducting ongoing phishing and social engineering training for employees.\n\nOur visibility showed a marked drop after March 4, with Emotet bots and Tier 1 C2s dropping\ndown to 2,855 and 36, respectively. However, those numbers already appear to be climbing\nonce again: we are currently tracking 6,435 bots and 62 Tier 1 C2s.\n\nWe would like to thank the many researchers who track and share information to help defend\nagainst the Emotet botnet. In particular, we are grateful to the tireless efforts of Joseph\nRoosen and the Cryptolaemus team, and Roman Hüssy of abuse.ch.\n\n\n-----\n\nBlack Lotus Labs took action to null-route some Emotet C2 infrastructure and will continue to\ncollaborate with the community to detect and disrupt Emotet. We encourage other\norganizations to alert on these and similar indicators in their environments.\n\n[For additional IoCs associated with this campaign, please visit our GitHub page.](https://github.com/blacklotuslabs/IOCs/blob/main/Emotet_Redux_IoCs.txt)\n\nIf you would like to collaborate on similar research, please contact us on Twitter\n@BlackLotusLabs.\n\nThis information is provided “as is” without any warranty or condition of any kind, either\nexpress or implied.
