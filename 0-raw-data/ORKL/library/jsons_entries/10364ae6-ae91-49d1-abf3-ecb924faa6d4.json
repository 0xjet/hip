We took\nimmediate action to prevent the encrypton of our systems, further secure our environment,\nand initiate an internal and external investigation into the incident.\n\nCrytek confirmed that Egregor operators later leaked documents stolen during the incident\non their data leak site.\n\n\"Based on our investigation, the information in some case included individuals' first and last\nname, job title, company name, email, business address, phone number and country,\"\nCrytek revealed.\n\n_Crytek ransomware letter (BleepingComputer)_\n\n## Data breach impact downplayed\n\nThe game developer tried to reassure affected customers by saying \"the website itself was\ndifficult to identify [..], so that in our estimation, only very few people will have taken note of\nit.\"\n\nCrytek added downloading the leaked data would've also taken too long, which would have\nalso likely represented a significant hurdle that stopped people from trying to grab it.\n\nCrytek also believes that those who attempted downloading the stolen data were\ndiscouraged by the \"huge risk\" of compromising their systems with malware embedded in\nthe leaked documents.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile these points would make sense for individuals with little to no experience in using\ncomputers, most people who would want and know how to get their hands on this type of\ndata would likely use downloaders and open the leaked files in a virtual machine.\n\nFurthermore, threat actors commonly download files leaked on ransomware data leaks to\nsell or share with other cybercriminals.\n\nConsidering this, Crytek's attempts to downplay the seriousness of the data breach\nresulting from the October 2020 ransomware attack don't hold water.\n\n\"While we are not aware of misues of any information potentially impacted, we are providing\nthis notice as part of our precautions,\" Crytek added.\n\n_Crytek data leak (BleepingComputer)_\nAs BleepingComputer reported in October, Crytek's systems were hit by Egregor\nransomware in an attack confirmed by sources familiar with the incident.\n\nWhile we were not told how many Crytek systems were encrypted in the attack, we were\ntold that files were encrypted and renamed to include the '.CRYTEK' extension.\n\nThe stolen data leaked by Egregor on their data leak site included:\n\nFiles related to WarFace\nCrytek's canceled Arena of Fate MOBA game\nDocuments with information on their network operations\n\nOther well-known companies and organizations worldwide attacked by Egregor in the past\n[include Barnes and

affiliates arrested in Ukraine\n\nIn February 2021, several members of the Egregor ransomware operation were arrested in\nUkraine following a joint operation between French and Ukrainian law enforcement.\n\nLaw enforcement officers made the arrests after French authorities could trace ransom\npayments to individuals located in Ukraine.\n\nThe arrested individuals are believed to be Egregor affiliates whose job was to hack into\ncorporate networks and deploy the ransomware.\n\nEgregor launched in September 2020, right after the Maze ransomware gang began\nshutting down its operation.\n\n[At the time, BleepingComputer was told by threat actors that Maze's affiliates switched to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-is-shutting-down-its-cybercrime-operation/)\nEgregor's RaaS, allowing the new RaaS to launch with experienced and skilled hackers.\n\nEgregor operates as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) where the ransomware developers\npartner with affiliates who conduct the attacks, splitting the ransom payments.\n\nAs part of this arrangement, the core team earns between 20-30% of all paid ransoms,\nwhile affiliates pocketed the other 70-80%.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cybersecurity firm Kivu said in a February report that Egregor has 10-12 core members and](https://kivuconsulting.com/download/successful-ransomware-is-organized-crime-2/)\n20-25 semi-exclusively vetted members, and it amassed over 200 victims since its\nSeptember launch.\n\n_A Crytek spokesperson was not available for comment when contacted by_\n_BleepingComputer earlier today or after our initial report from October 2020._\n\n### Related
