This\nassessment is based on the historical targeting pattern of this threat activity group and the typical area\nof responsibility of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Northern Theater Command-aligned threat actors.\n\nIn this campaign, we observed a particular focus on the targeting of South Korean academic entities.\nThe targeting of academia more generally fits within wider Chinese espionage efforts that serve\nmultiple purposes, including intellectual property (IP) theft and expanding Chinese Communist Party\n(CCP) soft power and influence within higher education internationally. Business leaders in companies\nengaging closely with academia in countries of strategic interest to Chinese intelligence services should\nconsider the business risks of both potential IP loss and academic institutions’ vulnerability to foreign\nstate influence that could lead to reputational damage through association.\n\nMore widely, intelligence collection within South Korea from Chinese state-sponsored actors is likely\ndriven by both regional proximity as well as the country’s strategic role in China's competition with the\nUnited States (US) and other regional allies within the Indo-Pacific region. In recent months, Chinese\nofficials have been [increasingly outspoken](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/04/china/wang-yi-china-japan-south-korea-intl-hnk/index.html) on South Korea’s perceived movement toward closer\nrelations with the US. Of particular note, in May 2023, a South Korean news outlet [cited](https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/1094072.html) anonymous\n[“senior diplomatic officials” to report that China threatened to withhold cooperation with Seoul on North](https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/1094074.html)\nKorea and other issues if South Korea continues crossing “red lines” related to South Korea “meddling\nwith Taiwan” or supporting “the US and Japan’s containment of China”. Notably, multiple observed\nTAG-74 decoy documents and spoofed domains specifically related to inter-Korean cooperation and\nreunification. These highlighted geopolitical tensions are likely to drive increased intelligence collection\nefforts from Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups such as TAG-74 against South Korean\npublic and private sector entities. This intelligence could be used to define Chinese diplomatic or\nbusiness engagement with South Korean entities, especially when foreign policy doesn't align with\nChinese strategic objectives.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n  - TAG-74 is a Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group traditionally tasked with intelligence\ncollection against organizations within South Korea, Japan, and Russia. In the activity highlighted\n\n[1 TAG-74 overlaps with reported activity under the aliases Tonto Team, COPPER, CactusPete, Earth Akhlut, Karma Panda, and Bronze Huntley (1,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/bisonal-10-years-of-play/)\n[2), a group publicly linked to the People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force (PLASSF) former Shenyang Military Region Technical](https://vb2020.vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-Lunghi-Horejsi.pdf)\n[Reconnaissance Bureau (now part of the Northern Theater Command) (1, 2).](https://web.archive.org/web/20220706211644/https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/summit/cds-2019/presentations/cds19-executive-s08-achievement-unlocked.pdf)\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat Analysis\n\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nCompiled HTML (.chm) files likely distributed via spearphishing. These .chm files consist of 3 primary\ncomponents:\n\n1. An embedded legitimate executable that is vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking. Observed\nexecutables used include the filenames vias.exe, LBTWiz32.exe,\n```\n   PresentationSettings.exe, and ImagingDevices.exe.\n\n```\n2. A malicious DLL loaded via the accompanying legitimate executable via DLL search order\n\nhijacking.\n3. A HTML file that is used to:\n\n    - display a decoy document to the user\n\n    - execute a script to decompile the contents of the .chm file via the native Windows HTML\nHelp executable program (hh.exe)\n\n    - execute the legitimate executable vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking, either directly\nor via the RUN registry key\n\n**Figure 2: Example TAG-74 HTML file containing script to decompile .chm file and execute vias.exe (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nThe HTML file, as shown in Figure 2, includes a bitmap shortcut object which, when clicked, executes\nthe native HTML Help Windows binary hh.exe to decompile the .chm file and a second shortcut which\nexecutes the legitimate executable vias.exe contained within the .chm. An embedded script then\nuses the native HTML click() method to simulate a mouse-click on the first object, which executes\nthe first shortcut, waits 2 seconds, and then repeats this for the second object to trigger the DLL\nsearch order hijacking chain.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\ninter-Korean cooperation and reunification as well as specific academic institutions, indicating a likely\nparticular interest in these areas from TAG-74 actors.\n\n|IP Address|ASN|First Seen|Last Seen|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|45.133.194[.]135|AS206804 (EstNOC OY)|March 27, 2023|April 6, 2023|\n|92.38.135[.]92|AS202422 (G-Core Labs)|February 8, 2023|May 15, 2023|\n|141.164.60[.]28|AS20473 (AS-CHOOPA)|October 13, 2023|April 17, 2023|\n|158.247.223[.]50|AS20473 (AS-CHOOPA)|March 13, 2023|June 7, 2023|\n|158.247.234[.]163|AS20473 (AS-CHOOPA)|November 4, 2023|June 7, 2023|\n\n\n**Table 1: IP addresses observed in use by TAG-74 during 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n|Likely Spoofed Entity|Industry|Spoof Domain(s)|\n|---|---|---|\n|Daum|IT|attachdaum.servecounterstrike[.]com attachmaildaum.servecounterstrike[.]com attachmaildaum.serveblog[.]net logindaums.ddnsking[.]com loginsdaum.viewdns[.]net|\n|bizmeka[.]com|IT|bizmeka.viewdns[.]net|\n|Hamonsoft|IT|hamonsoft.serveblog[.]net|\n|Hanseo University|Academic|hanseo1.hopto[.]org|\n|hometax[.]go[.]kr|Government|hometax.onthewifi[.]com|\n|Mail Plug|IT|mailplug.ddnsking[.]com|\n|Democratic Party of Korea|Political|minjoo2.servehttp[.]com|\n\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n|National Election Commission|Government|necgo.serveblog[.]net|\n|---|---|---|\n|Pixoneer Geomatics ((주)픽소니어)|IT|pixoneer.myvnc[.]com|\n|Peaceful Unification Advisory Council|Government|puacgo1.servemp3[.]com|\n|Satrec Initiative|Aerospace|satreci.bounceme[.]net|\n|Sejong University|Academic|sejonglog.hopto[.]org|\n|National Institute for Unification Education|Academic|unipedu.servebeer[.]com|\n\n\n**Table 2: Selection of TAG-74 DDNS domains likely spoofing specific South Korean entities (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n\n#### Use of Open-Source ReVBShell Backdoor for Initial Access\n\n\nAs noted, TAG-74 has employed a slightly modified version of the open-source ReVBShell backdoor.\nModifications include additional functions responsible for:\n\n  - Base64-encoding C2 traffic\n\n  - Execution guardrails which, if ESET antivirus is detected on the infected host, set the C2 server\nIP address 0.0.0[.]0 and the malware is exited\n\n  - Additional commands or functions for code execution, changing the sleep interval, self-deletion,\nand enumeration via WMI command-line (WMIC)\n\nReVBShell is configured to sleep for a specified interval (the default is 5 seconds) following a NOOP\nresponse from the C2 server. In most cases, this sleep time is changed from the default 5 seconds to 5\nminutes in observed TAG-74 activity. The TAG-74 variant also contains additional functionality to edit\nthis sleep interval via a C2 command.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: Additional functions present in customized ReVBShell version responsible for Base64 encoding and decoding data**\n\n\n(Source: Recorded Future)\n\n\n#### Continued Usage of Flagship Malware Bisonal for Follow-on Activity\n\n\nInsikt Group observed multiple Bisonal samples communicating with C2 infrastructure attributed to\nTAG-74 (see Table 3). Bisonal is likely intended to be used as a follow-on malware family loaded after\ninitial access is established due to the additional functionality beyond the lightweight ReVBShell. Bisonal\nis a long-running, custom backdoor exclusive to Chinese state-sponsored threat activity that has been\n[used in targeted intrusion activity primarily in Japan, South Korea, and Russia since at least 2010 (1,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/bisonal-10-years-of-play/) [2,](https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2020/pdf/JSAC2020_3_takai_jp.pdf)\n[3, 4).](https://web.archive.org/web/20130920120931/https:/www.rsaconference.com/writable/presentations/file_upload/cle-t04_final_v1.pdf)\n\n|SHA256 Hash|Filename|C2|\n|---|---|---|\n|11cd4b64dcac3195c01ffc937ae1eb77aa2f 98d560a75347036d54a1cf69a5fd|SearchFilterHost.exe|formsgle.freedynamicdns[.]net|\n|01e5ebc2c096d465800660a0ad6d62208 a5b2b675e3700f3734fac225b1d38bd|-|satreci.bounceme[.]net|\n|a88ca28b0948e810d4eb519db7b72a40cf e7907ce4c6a881a192880278f3c8b5|msfltr32.exe|hanseo1.hopto[.]org|\n|89f250599e09f8631040e73cd9ea5e515d 87e3d1d989f484686893becec1a9bc|-|sarang.serveminecraft[.]net|\n|0ea0b19c562d20c6ac89a1f2db06eedcb1 47cde2281e79bb0497cef62094b514|MySnake.EXE|sarang.serveminecraft[.]net|\n\n\n**Table 3: TAG-74 Bisonal samples first observed in 2022 (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nInsikt Group conducted a comparative analysis of the payload loaded by the sample\n```\n11cd4b64dcac3195c01ffc937ae1eb77aa2f98d560a75347036d54a1cf69a5fd listed in Table 3,\n\n```\nand identified close similarities with a variant of Bisonal [reported by NTT Security in 2020. The sample](https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2020/pdf/JSAC2020_3_takai_jp.pdf)\nwe analyzed had the following commands, which closely align with the variant analyzed by NTT\n[Security (page 27):](https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2020/pdf/JSAC2020_3_takai_jp.pdf#page=27)\n\n  - Change prefix of sending data (unknown and unknown2 fields inside the payload struct in Figure\n**6)**\n\n  - Send process information\n\n  - Send drive list\n\n  - Send file information\n\n  - Process termination\n\n  - Execute command\n\n  - File download\n\n  - File upload\n\n  - Delete file\n\n  - Recreate socket\n\n  - Sending socket objects\n\n  - File execution\n\nThe sample analyzed by Insikt Group also uses the same string decryption algorithm and reuses the\n```\n1213 key highlighted within the NTT Security Bisonal research (page 28). Additionally, the magic bytes\n0A 1B 2C 3D referenced in the NTT Security analysis on one of the Bisonal variants’ C2\n\n```\n[communications (page 64) matched both of the analyzed samples.](https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2020/pdf/JSAC2020_3_takai_jp.pdf#page=64)\n\nThe second sample in Table 3\n(01e5ebc2c096d465800660a0ad6d62208a5b2b675e3700f3734fac225b1d38bd), is packed using\nVMProtect and loads a Bisonal payload very similar to the first. Example C2 communications for this\nsample are shown in Figure 5 — this includes the magic bytes 0A 1B 2C 3D alongside basic victim\ninformation such as computer name, user name, operating system IP address, and a campaign/target\ncode, as also shown in Figure 6. This communication structure matches that of the first sample.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payloads loaded by the other 3 samples in Table 3 all contain the [characteristic marker string](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-bisonal-malware-used-attacks-russia-south-korea/)\n```\nbisonal, which was not present in the other 2 analyzed samples. The presence of this marker string\n\n```\n[appears to vary based on the variant of Bisonal in use, which has evolved](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-bisonal-malware-used-attacks-russia-south-korea/) significantly over the past\ndecade.\n\n## Mitigations\n\nUsers should conduct the following measures to detect and mitigate activity associated with TAG-74\nactivity:\n\n  - Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any\nnetwork defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and, upon review, consider blocking\nconnection attempts to and from — the external IP addresses and domains linked in Appendix A.\n\n  - Organizations should consider blocking .chm and other low-legitimate-use file attachments at\nemail gateways and through application deny lists where possible, given the propensity of abuse\nand low prevalence of legitimate use in most environments.\n\n  - Recorded Future proactively detects and logs malicious server configurations in the Command\nand Control Security Control Feed. The Command and Control list includes both open-source\nand customized tools used by Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups, such as\nReVBShell. Recorded Future clients should alert on and block these C2 servers to allow for\ndetection and remediation of active intrusions.\n\n  - Since multiple state-sponsored and financially motivated threat activity groups continue to use\nDDNS domains in network intrusion activity, all TCP/UDP network traffic involving DDNS\nsubdomains should be blocked and logged (using [DNS RPZ](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dnsop-dns-rpz-00) or similar).\n\n  - Monitor for domain abuse, such as typosquat domains spoofing your organization, through the\nRecorded Future Brand Intelligence [module.](https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/)\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe observed TAG-74 campaign is indicative of the group’s long-term intelligence collection objectives\nagainst South Korean targets. Given the group’s persistent focus on South Korean organizations over\nmany years and the likely operational purview of the Northern Theater Command, the group is likely to\ncontinue to be highly active in conducting long-term intelligence-gathering on strategic targets within\nSouth Korea as well as in Japan and Russia.\n\nThe use of .chm files by Chinese state-sponsored actors is not particularly common outside of South\nKorea but has been seen both in TAG-74 campaigns and in activity attributed to North Korean\nstate-sponsored threat activity groups, such as Kimsuky and APT37, in activity targeting South Korea\n[(1, 2). Network defenders should consider monitoring for the presence and use of .chm files, especially](https://asec.ahnlab.com/jp/53039/)\nif they are not typically used within their environment. Generally, the use of more unusual file types for\n[initial access, such as .chm, has increased in prevalence following a shift away from macro usage by](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/misc/pfpt-us-threat-research-2023-05-12-cybercrime-experimentation.pdf)\nthreat actors throughout 2022 and 2023.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix A — Indicators of Compromise\n\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix B — Mitre ATT&CK Techniques\n\n|Tactic: Technique|ATT&CK Code|\n|---|---|\n|Initial Access - Spearphishing Attachment|T1566.001|\n|Execution - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Visual Basic|T1059.005|\n|Execution - User Execution: Malicious File|T1204.002|\n|Persistence - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder|T1547.001|\n|Defense Evasion - Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Search Order Hijacking|T1574.001|\n|Defense Evasion - System Binary Proxy Execution: Compiled HTML File|T1218.001|\n|Defense Evasion - Execution Guardrails|T1480|\n|Discovery - Software Discovery: Security Software Discovery|T1518.001|\n|Command and Control - Data Encoding: Standard Encoding|T1132.001|\n|Command and Control - Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols|T1071.001|\n|Command and Control - Encrypted Channel: Symmetric Cryptography|T1573.001|\n|Exfiltration - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel|T1041|\n\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix C — Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis\n\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Insikt Group[®]\n\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group, the company’s threat research division, comprises analysts and security researchers with deep government, law\nenforcement, military, and intelligence agency experience.
