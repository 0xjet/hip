Kaspersky Lab refrains from confirming the actual actors behind advanced\ngroups such as nation-states, so it refers to these attackers as \"Chinese-speaking\" cyber\nespionage groups.\n\n“Immediately after the signing of the agreement, there was silence” in attacks against the\nUS, Raiu said in an interview with Dark Reading. “Then there were some small bits and\npieces of random noise … but after that, they [Chinese-speaking APTs] completely went\nsilent in the US and UK,” Raiu said, referring to Xi’s similar no-hack deal in October with\nPrime Minister Cameron in the UK.\n\nRaiu said the cyber espionage groups appear to have shifted their focus to Russia and other\nformer Soviet countries as new sources of intellectual property for economic gain in the wake\nof the Obama-Xi pact.\n\nWhile the Obama-Xi agreement was applauded by the security and IT industries as a good\nfirst step, critics had expected China ultimately not to fully comply with the agreement. Those\nconcerns appeared to come to fruition in October, when CrowdStrike reported spotting\nmultiple Chinese APT groups attempting to steal business secrets from seven US companies\nin the technology and pharmaceutical industries the day after the Obama-Xi agreement. The\nObama-Xi pact stops short of banning traditional espionage via hacking.\n\nKaspersky’s Raiu said his company has seen activity from Mirage, a Chinese-speaking APT\ngroup that traditionally has targeted ministries of foreign affairs, waging attacks in Russia.\n“Now they are super-active in Russia,” he said, with interests in military espionage, for\nexample. But there have been “several” APT groups seen targeting Russian victims, he said.\n\nKurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, says the increased activity\ntargets “a geopolitical profile.”\n\nIndustries that support those geopolitical interests and structure are also under attack, he\nsaid.\n\nCrowdStrike also has seen more Chinese attacks on Russia -- from a specific Chinese APT\ngroup called Hammer Panda against Russian Federation nations. But it's also still seeing\nChina-based attacks on US companies.\n\n\"We have definitely observed an increase in Hammer Panda targeting of the Russian\nFederation. In the [CrowdStrike] Global Threat Report ... we observe that following an\nagreement between China and Russia in May 2015 to abolish any type of hacking between\nthe two states, we observed an almost immediate violation of the agreement by China,\" said\nAdam Meyers, vice president of intelligence at CrowdStrike. \"We have continued to observe\nChina-based intrusion groups targeting US companies.\"\n\n\n-----\n\n**Find out more about** **[APTs at Interop 2016, May 2-6, at the Mandalay Bay](http://www.interop.com/lasvegas/conference/security.php?mp_dr_le_ilv16_edt)**\n\n**Convention Center, Las Vegas.** **[Register today and receive an early bird discount of](http://www.interop.com/lasvegas/registration/?mp_dr_le_ilv16_edt)**\n**$200.**\n\n[Vulnerabilities/ThreatsThreat IntelligenceAttacks/BreachesAdvanced Threats](http://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats)\n\nKeep up with the latest cybersecurity threats, newly-discovered vulnerabilities, data breach\ninformation, and emerging trends.
