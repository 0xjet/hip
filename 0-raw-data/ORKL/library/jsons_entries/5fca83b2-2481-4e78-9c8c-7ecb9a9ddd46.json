It was found in the wild in 2007 and since then it has been continually\nmaintained and developed.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn recent years, QakBot has become one of the leading banking Trojans around the globe.\nIts main purpose is to steal banking credentials (e.g., logins, passwords, etc.), though it has\nalso acquired functionality allowing it to spy on financial operations, spread itself, and install\nransomware in order to maximize revenue from compromised organizations.\n\nTo this day, QakBot continues to grow in terms of functionality, with even more capabilities\nand new techniques such as logging keystrokes, a backdoor functionality, and techniques to\nevade detection. It’s worth mentioning that the latter includes virtual environment detection,\nregular self-updates and cryptor/packer changes. In addition, QakBot tries to protect itself\nfrom being analyzed and debugged by experts and automated tools.\n\nAnother interesting piece of functionality is the ability to steal emails. These are later used by\nthe attackers to send targeted emails to the victims, with the obtained information being used\nto lure victims into opening those emails.\n\n## QakBot infection chain\n\nQakBot is known to infect its victims mainly via spam campaigns. In some cases, the emails\nwere delivered with Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel) or password-protected\narchives with the documents attached. The documents contained macros and victims were\nprompted to open the attachments with claims that they contained important information\n(e.g., an invoice). In some cases, the emails contained links to web pages distributing\nmalicious documents.\n\nHowever, there is another infection vector that involves a malicious QakBot payload being\ntransferred to the victim’s machine via other malware on the compromised machine.\n\nThe initial infection vectors may vary depending on what the threat actors believe has the\nbest chance of success for the targeted organization(s). It’s known that various threat actors\n[perform reconnaissance (OSINT) of target organizations beforehand to decide which](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/osint/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\ninfection vector is most suitable.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_QakBot infection chain_**\n\nThe infection chain of recent QakBot releases (2020-2021 variants) is as follows:\n\nThe user receives a phishing email with a ZIP attachment containing an Office\ndocument with embedded macros, the document itself or a link to download malicious\ndocument.\nThe user opens the malicious attachment/link and is tricked into clicking “Enable\ncontent”.\nA malicious macro is executed. Some variants perform a ‘GET’ request to a URL\nrequesting a ‘PNG’ However, the file is in fact a binary.\nThe loaded payload (stager) includes another binary containing encrypted resource\nmodules. One of the encrypted resources has the DLL binary (loader) which is\ndecrypted later during runtime.\nThe ‘Stager’ loads the ‘Loader’ into the memory, which decrypts and runs the payload\nduring runtime. The configuration settings are retrieved from another resource.\nThe payload communicates with the C2 server.\nAdditional threats such as ProLock ransomware can now be pushed to the infected\nmachine.\n\n## Typical QakBot functions\n\nTypical QakBot malicious activity observed in the wild includes:\n\nCollecting information about the compromised host;\nCreating scheduled tasks (privilege escalation and persistency);\nCredentials harvesting:\n\nCredential dumping (Mimikatz, exe access)*;\nPassword stealing (from browser data and cookies);\nTargeting web banking links (web injects)*.\nPassword brute forcing;\nRegistry manipulation (persistence);\nCreating a copy of itself;\nProcess injection to conceal the malicious process.\n\n## Communication with C2\n\nThe QakBot malware contains a list of 150 IP addresses hardcoded into the loader binary\nresource. Most of these addresses belong to other infected systems that are used as a proxy\nto forward traffic to other proxies or the real С2.\n\nCommunication with the С2 is a HTTPS POST request with Base64-encoded data. The data\nis encrypted with the RC4 algorithm. The static string “jHxastDcds)oMc=jvh7wdUhxcsdt2”\nand a random 16-byte sequence are used for encryption. The data itself is in JSON format.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Original message in JSON format_**\n\n**_HTTPS POST request with encrypted JSON_**\n\nUsually, after infection the bot sends a ‘PING’ message, ‘SYSTEM INFO’ message and ‘ASK\nfor COMMAND’ message, and the C2 replies with ‘ACK’ and ‘COMMAND’ messages. If\nadditional modules were pushed by the C2, the bot sends a ‘STOLEN INFO’ message\ncontaining data stolen by the modules.\n\n**‘PING’ message – bot request message to C2 with ‘BOT ID’ in order to check if С2 is**\nactive:\n\n**_‘PING’ message_**\n\n**‘ACK’ message – C2 response message with field “16” containing the external IP**\naddress of the infected system, the only valuable information:\n\n\n-----\n\n**_ACK message_**\n\n**‘SYSTEM INFO’ message – bot request message to C2 with information collected**\nabout the infected system. In addition to general system information such as OS\nversion and bitness, user name, computer name, domain, screen resolution, system\ntime, system uptime and bot uptime, it also contains the results of the following utilities\nand WMI queries:\n\nwhoami /all\narp -a\nipconfig /all\nnet view /all\ncmd /c set\nnslookup -querytype=ALL -timeout=10 _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.{DOMAIN}\nnltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts\nnet share\nroute print\nnetstat -nao\nnet localgroup\nqwinsta\nWMI Query ROOT\\CIMV2:Win32_BIOS\nWMI Query ROOT\\CIMV2:Win32_DiskDrive\nWMI Query ROOT\\CIMV2:Win32_PhysicalMemory\nWMI Query ROOT\\CIMV2:Win32_Product\nWMI Query ROOT\\CIMV2:Win32_PnPEntity\n\n\n-----\n\n**_‘SYSTEM INFO’ message_**\n\n**‘ASK for COMMAND’ message – bot command request message to C2. After the**\n‘SYSTEM INFO’ message is sent, the bot starts asking the C2 for a command to\nexecute. One of the main fields is “14” – the SALT. This field is unique and changes in\nevery request. It is used to protect against hijacking or takeover of a bot. After receiving\nthis request, the С2 uses the SALT in the signing procedure and places the signature in\nthe response, so the bot can check the signed data. Only a valid and signed command\nwill be executed\n\n\n-----\n\n**_‘ASK for COMMAND’ message_**\n\n**‘COMMAND’ message – C2 response message with command to execute. The**\ncurrent version of the bot supports 24 commands, most of them related to download,\nexecution, drop of additional modules and module configuration files with different\noptions, or setup/update configuration values.\nThis type of message contains the signed value of the SALT (obtained from the bot’s\nrequest field “14”), COMMAND ID and MODULE ID. The other values of the message\nare not signed.In previous versions, the bot received modules and commands\nimmediately after infection and sending a ‘SYSTEM INFO’ message. Now, the C2\nresponds with an empty command for about an hour. Only after that will the C2 send\ncommands and modules in the response. We believe that this time delay is used to\nmake it difficult to receive and analyze new commands and modules in an isolated\ncontrolled environment.\n\n**_‘COMMAND’ C2 response with empty command_**\n\nIf the C2 pushes some modules, the Base64-encoded binary is placed into field “20” of the\nmessage.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_‘COMMAND’ C2 response with additional module to load_**\n\n**‘STOLEN INFO’ message – bot message to C2 with stolen information like passwords,**\naccounts, emails, etc. Stolen information is RC4 encrypted and Base64 encoded. The\nkey for the RC4 encryption is generated in a different way and based on the infected\nsystem ID (aka Bot ID) values, and not based on a static string as in the case of traffic\nencryption.\n\n**_‘STOLEN INFO’ message_**\n\nOnce communication with the C2 server has been established, QakBot is known to\ndownload and use additional modules in order to perform its malicious operations.\n\nThe additional modules differ from sample to sample and may include: ‘Cookie grabber’,\n‘Email Collector’, ‘Credentials grabber’, and ‘Proxy module’ among others.\n\nThese modules may be written by the threat actors themselves or may be borrowed from\nthird-party repositories and adapted. It can vary from sample to sample. For example, there\nare older samples that may use Mimikatz for credentials dumping.\n\nBelow are some of the modules that we found during our research.\n\n## Additional modules\n\n**Cookie Grabber – collects cookies from popular browsers (Edge, Firefox, Chrome,**\nInternet Explorer).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hidden VNC – allows threat actors to connect to the infected machine and interact with**\nit without the real user knowing.\n\n**Email Collector – tries to find Microsoft Outlook on the infected machine, then iterates**\nover the software folders and recursively collects emails. Finally, the module exfiltrates\nthe collected emails to the remote server.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_The threat actors distributed a debug version of the email collector module at some_**\n**_point_**\n\n**Hooking module – hooks a hardcoded set of WinAPI and (if they exist) Mozilla DLL**\nHooking is used to perform web injects, sniff traffic and keyboard data and even\nprevent DNS resolution of certain domains. Hooking works in the following way:\nQakBot injects a hooking module into the appropriate process, the module finds\nfunctions from the hardcoded set and modifies the functions so they jump to custom\ncode.\n\n**_The module contains a ciphered list of DLLs and functions that the bot will hook_**\n\n**Passgrabber module – collects logins and passwords from various sources: Firefox**\nand Chrome files, Microsoft Vault storage, etc. Instead of using Mimikatz as in previous\nversions, the module collects passwords using its own algorithms.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Procedure that collects passwords from different sources_**\n\n**Proxy module – tries to determine which ports are available to listen to using the**\nUPnP port forwarding and tier 2 С2 query. Comparing current and old proxy loader\nversions revealed some interesting things: the threat actors decided to remove the\ncURL dependency from the binary and perform all HTTP communications using their\nown code. Besides removing cURL, they also removed OpenSSL dependencies and\nembedded all functions into a single executable – there are no more proxy loaders or\nproxy modules, it’s a single file now.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_UPnP port forwarding query construction_**\n\nAfter trying to determine whether ports are open and the machine could act as a C2 tier 2\nproxy, the proxy module also starts a multithreaded SOCKS5 proxy server. The SOCKS5\nprotocol is encapsulated into the QakBot proxy protocol composed of: QakBot proxy\ncommand (1 byte), version (1 byte), session id (4 bytes), total packet length (dword), data\n(total packet length-10). Incoming and outgoing packets are stored in the buffers and may be\nreceived/transmitted one by one or in multiple packets in a single TCP data segment\n(streamed).\n\nThe usual proxy module execution flow is as follows:\n\n1. Communicate with the C2, try to forward ports with UPnP and determine available\n\nports and report them to the C2. The usual C2 communication protocol used here is\nHTTP POST RC4-ciphered JSON data.\n2. Download the OpenSSL library. Instead of saving the downloaded file, QakBot\n\nmeasures the download speed and deletes the received file.\n3. Set up external PROXY-C2 connection that was received with command 37 (update\n\nconfig)/module 274 (proxy) by the stager.\n\nCommunicating with the external PROXY-C2:\n\n1. Send initial proxy module request. The initial request contains the bot ID, external IP\n\naddress of the infected machine, reverse DNS lookup of the external IP address,\ninternet speed (measured earlier) and seconds since the proxy module started.\n2. Establish a connection (proxy commands sequence 1->10->11) with the PROXY-C2.\n3. Initialize sessions, perform socks5 authorization with login/password (received from\n\nPROXY-C2 with command 10).\n4. Begin SOCKS5-like communication wrapped into the QakBot proxy module protocol.\n\nQakBot proxy commands are as follows:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n1 Hello (bot->C2)\n\n10 Set up auth credentials (C2->bot)\n\n11 Confirm credentials setup (bot->C2)\n\n2 Create new proxy session (C2->bot)\n\n3 SOCKS5 AUTH (bot->C2)\n\n4 SOCKS5 requests processing (works for both sides)\n\n5 Close session (works for both sides)\n\n\n-----\n\n6 Update session state/session state updated notification (works for both\nsides)\n\n7 Update session state/session state updated notification (works for both\nsides)\n\n8 PING (C2->bot)\n\n9 PONG (bot->C2)\n\n19 Save current time in registry (C2->bot)\n\n**_Parsed packets from C2_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Tracking single proxy_**\n\n**Web inject – the configuration file for the hooking module**\n\nOnce communication with the C2 is established, one of the additional modules that is\ndownloaded is the web-inject module. It intercepts the victim’s traffic by injecting the\nmodule into the browser’s process and hooking the network API. The hooking module\ngets the execution flow from intercepted APIs, and as soon as the victim accesses\ncertain web pages related to banking and finance, additional JavaScript is injected into\nthe source page.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Fragment of JavaScript injected into the source page of the Wells Fargo login page_**\n\n## QakBot statistics\n\nWe analyzed statistics on QakBot attacks collected from our Kaspersky Security Network\n(KSN), where anonymized data voluntarily provided by Kaspersky users is accumulated and\nprocessed. In the first seven months of 2021 our products detected 181,869 attempts to\ndownload or run QakBot. This number is lower than the detection number from January to\nJuly 2020, though the number of users affected grew by 65% compared to the previous year\nand reached 17,316.\n\n_Number of users affected by QakBot attacks from January to July in 2020 and 2021_\n_[(download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/09/01155141/01-en-qakbot.png)_\n\nWe observed the largest campaigns in Q1 2021 when 12,704 users encountered QakBot,\nwith 8,068 Kaspersky users being targeted in January and 4,007 in February.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nQakBot is a known Trojan-Banker whose techniques may vary from binary to binary (older\nand newer versions). It has been active for over a decade and doesn’t look like going away\nanytime soon. The malware is continuously receiving updates and the threat actors keep\nadding new capabilities and updating its modules in order to steal information and maximize\nrevenue.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe know that threat actors change how they perform their malicious activities based on\nsecurity vendor activities, using sophisticated techniques to stay under the radar. Although\nQakBot uses different techniques to avoid detection, for example, process enumeration in\norder to find running anti-malware solutions, our products are able to detect the threat using\nbehavior analysis.
