These stealer trojans were spread as**\n**harmless software and were installed more than 5,856,010 times.**\n\nIn total, our specialists uncovered 10 of these trojan apps. Of them, 9 were available on\nGoogle Play:\n\n1. a photo-editing software called Processing Photo. It is detected by Dr.Web Anti-Virus\n\nas **[Android.PWS.Facebook.13 and was spread by the developer chikumburahamilton.](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.13&lng=en)**\nIt was installed over 500,000 times.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. applications that enabled access limitations for using other software installed on\n\nAndroid devices: App Lock Keep from the developer Sheralaw Rence, App Lock\nManager from the developer Implummet col, and Lockit Master from the developer\n[Enali mchicolo―all detected as Android.PWS.Facebook.13. They were downloaded](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.13&lng=en)\nat least 50,000, 10 and 5,000 times respectively.\n3. Rubbish Cleaner from the developer SNT.rbcl―a utility to optimize the Android device\n\nperformance. It was downloaded over 100,000 times. Dr.Web detects it as\n**[Android.PWS.Facebook.13.](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.13&lng=en)**\n4. astrology programs Horoscope Daily from the developer HscopeDaily momo and\n\nHoroscope Pi from the developer Talleyr Shauna, also detected as\n**[Android.PWS.Facebook.13. The former had more than 100,000 installs while the](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.13&lng=en)**\nlatter―more than 1,000 installs.\n5. a fitness program called Inwell Fitness, and detected as Android.PWS.Facebook.14\n\nfrom the developer Reuben Germaine. It has more than 100,000 installs.\n6. an image editing app called PIP Photo that was spread by the developer Lillians. Its\n\n[various versions are detected as Android.PWS.Facebook.17 and](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.17&lng=en)\n**[Android.PWS.Facebook.18. This app has over 5,000,000 downloads.](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.18&lng=en)**\n\nUpon Doctor Web’s specialists report to Google, part of these malicious applications was\nremoved from Google Play. However, at the time of this news release, some apps were still\navailable for download.\n\nDuring the course of analyzing of these stealer trojans, we discovered an earlier modification\nthat was spread through Google Play under the guise of an image editing software called\nEditorPhotoPip, which has already been removed from the official Android app store but still\navailable on software aggregator websites. This modification was added to the Dr.Web virus\n[database as Android.PWS.Facebook.15.](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.15&lng=en)\n\n[While the Android.PWS.Facebook.13,](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.13&lng=en) **[Android.PWS.Facebook.14, and](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.14&lng=en)**\n**[Android.PWS.Facebook.15 are native Android apps, the Android.PWS.Facebook.17 and](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.15&lng=en)**\n**[Android.PWS.Facebook.18 are utilizing the Flutter framework designed for cross-platform](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.18&lng=en)**\ndevelopment. Despite this, all of them can be considered modifications of the same trojan\nsince they use identical configuration file formats and identical JavaScript scripts to steal\nuser data.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe applications were fully functional, which was supposed to weaken the vigilance of\npotential victims. With that, to access all of the apps’ functions and, allegedly, to disable inapp ads, users were prompted to log into their Facebook accounts. The advertisements\ninside some of the apps were indeed present, and this maneuver was intended to further\nencourage Android device owners to perform the required actions.\n\nThis is how some of these apps looked upon launch:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nAnd this is the message encouraging potential victims to log into their Facebook account:\n\n\n-----\n\nIf users agreed and clicked the login button, they saw standard social network login form as\nshown on the next screenshot:\n\nWith that, the displayed form was genuine. These trojans used a special mechanism to trick\ntheir victims. After receiving the necessary settings from one of the C&C servers upon\nlaunch, they loaded the legitimate Facebook web page https://www.facebook.com/login.php\ninto WebView. Next, they loaded JavaScript received from the C&C server into the same\nWebView. This script was directly used to highjack the entered login credentials. After that,\nthis JavaScript, using the methods provided through the JavascriptInterface annotation,\npassed stolen login and password to the trojan applications, which then transferred the data\n\n\n-----\n\nto the attackers C&C server. After the victim logged into their account, the trojans also stole\ncookies from the current authorization session. Those cookies were also sent to\ncybercriminals.\n\nAnalysis of the malicious programs showed that they all received settings for stealing logins\nand passwords of Facebook accounts. However, the attackers could have easily changed\nthe trojans’ settings and commanded them to load the web page of another legitimate\nservice. They could have even used a completely fake login form located on a phishing site.\nThus, the trojans could have been used to steal logins and passwords from any service.\n\nThe **[Android.PWS.Facebook.15 malicious program that turned out to be an earlier](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.15&lng=en)**\nmodification of the trojans, is identical to the others. However, it contains additional\nfunctionality to output the data into the log in Chinese, which may indicate its possible origin.\n\n[The appearance of the Android.PWS.Facebook.15 trojan with examples of its output to the](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.15&lng=en)\nlog file are shown below:\n\nDoctor Web recommends Android device owners install applications only from known and\ntrusted developers, as well as to pay attention to other user reviews. The reviews cannot\nprovide an absolute guarantee that the apps are harmless but can still alarm you about\npotential threats. You should also pay attention to when and which apps ask you to login into\nyour account. If you are not sure that what you are doing is safe, it would be better for you\nnot to proceed any further and uninstall the suspicious program.\n\nDr.Web Anti-Virus products for Android successfully detects and deletes all known\n[modifications of the Android.PWS.Facebook.13,](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.13&lng=en) **[Android.PWS.Facebook.14,](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.14&lng=en)**\n**[Android.PWS.Facebook.15,](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.15&lng=en)** **[Android.PWS.Facebook.17, and](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.17&lng=en)**\n**[Android.PWS.Facebook.18 trojan applications, so they pose no threat to our users.](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.18&lng=en)**\n\n\n-----\n\n[Indicators of compromise](https://github.com/DoctorWebLtd/malware-iocs/blob/master/Android.PWS.Facebook/README.adoc)\n\n[More details on Android.PWS.Facebook.13](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.13&lng=en)\n\n[More details on Android.PWS.Facebook.14](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.14&lng=en)\n\n[More details on Android.PWS.Facebook.15](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.15&lng=en)\n\n[More details on Android.PWS.Facebook.17](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.17&lng=en)\n\n[More details on Android.PWS.Facebook.18](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.PWS.Facebook.18&lng=en)\n\n## Your Android needs protection.\n\n Use Dr.Web\n\nThe first Russian anti-virus for Android\nOver 140 million downloads—just from Google Play\nAvailable free of charge for users of Dr.Web home products\n\n[Free download](https://f2.drweb.com/lr/?to=https%3A%2F%2Fdownload.drweb.com%2Fandroid%2F%3Flng%3Den%26from%3DANDROID_PROTECT_BLOCK_NEW)\n\n[What is the benefit of having an account?](https://www.drweb.com/user/advantages/?lng=en)\n\n## Tell us what you think\n\nTo ask Doctor Web’s site administration about a news item, enter @admin at the beginning\nof your comment.
