Due to the limitations\nimposed by the epidemiological situation, particular categories of users and businesses were\nincreasingly targeted by cybercriminals. While we were adjusting to remote work and the rest\nof the new conditions, so were scammers. As a result, 2020 was extremely eventful in terms\nof digital threats, in particular those faced by financial institutions.\n\nAt the same time, some of the known [APT (Advanced persistent threats) groups that are not](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/apt-advanced-persistent-threats/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\ngenerally targeting financial institutions have tried their hand at it. Existing at a special\ncrossroads between APT and financial crime, the Lazarus group has already been among\nthe most active ones in the financial sphere. In 2020, the group tried its hand at the big\n[extortion game with the VHD ransomware family. Later on other groups, such as](https://securelist.com/lazarus-on-the-hunt-for-big-game/97757/)\n[MuddyWater, followed suit.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iranian-state-hacker-group-linked-to-ransomware-deployments/)\n\nMoreover, in 2020, we saw regional actors go global. A few Brazilian malware families\nexpanded their operations to other continents, targeting victims in Europe and Asia. We have\n[dubbed the first four families to have done this (Guildma, Javali, Melcoz, Grandoreiro) “the](https://securelist.com/the-tetrade-brazilian-banking-malware/97779/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Tétrade . Later on the authors of Guildma also created the new banking malware Ghimob](https://securelist.com/ghimob-tetrade-threat-mobile-devices/99228/)\ntargeting users located in Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Germany, Angola, and\nMozambique.\n\nOf course, the known financial threats have remained, too. Thus, the year 2020 saw a surge\nin the use of Emotet, [described by Interpol as “the world’s most dangerous malware”. In the](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/emotet-botnet-named-most-wanted-malware-for-july-2020/)\n[beginning of 2021, law enforcement agencies all over the world joined their forces to disrupt](https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action)\nthe botnet’s infrastructure. According to Kaspersky experts, the operation will frustrate\nEmotet’s activities for at least several months. In the meantime, at least some of Emotet\n[customers have switched to Trickbot.](https://threatpost.com/trickbot-takes-over-emotet/164710/)\n\nEven though, in 2020, we have seen ever more sophisticated cyberattacks, the overall\nstatistics look encouraging: the number of users hit by computer and mobile malware\ndeclines, so does financial phishing. Still, that does not mean that the cyber world has\nbecome a safer place – it means that the cybercriminals’ goals and tactics have undergone a\nnumber of changes. Despite the decreasing general statistics, we see that attacks have\nbecome more targeted and business-oriented. At the same time, we observe cybercriminals\nto skillfully adapt themselves to the global changes and benefit from the teleworking\nvulnerabilities and the rising popularity of online shopping. This report aims to shed a light on\nmore details of financial cyberthreats in 2020.\n\n[This research is a continuation of our annual financial threat reports (2019,](https://securelist.com/financial-cyberthreats-in-2019/96692/) [2018 and](https://securelist.com/financial-cyberthreats-in-2018/89788/) [2017)](https://securelist.com/financial-cyberthreats-in-2017/84107/)\nproviding an overview of the latest trends and key events across the financial threat\nlandscape. Traditionally, the study covers the common phishing threats encountered by\nusers, along with Windows and Android-based financial malware.\n\n## Methodology\n\nIn this research, by financial malware we mean several types of malevolent software. Firstly,\nwe identify as financial the malware targeting users of financial services such as online\nbanking, payment systems, e-money services, e-shops, and cryptocurrency services.\nSecondly, we use the term to define the malware attempting to gain access to financial\norganizations and their infrastructure. In most cases, financial malware attacks rely on\nspamming and phishing activities, such as creating and distributing fake finance themed web\npages and emails to steal the victims’ payment info.\n\nTo examine the financial sector threat landscape, Kaspersky researchers have analyzed the\nmalicious activities on devices owned by individuals using the Kaspersky security products,\n[which they volunteered to make available to us through the Kaspersky Security Network. The](https://www.kaspersky.com/ksn)\ncorporate user statistics were collected from the enterprise security solutions, after our\ncustomers agreed to share their data with Kaspersky.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe data for 2020 was mostly compared against 2019 to monitor the malware development\ntrends. However, in some parts, for better insight into the financial malware evolution, the\nstudy also refers to earlier times.\n\n## Key findings\n\n**Phishing:**\n\nIn 2020, the percentage of users hit by phishing declined slightly from 15.7% to 13.2%.\nThis time around, e-shops became the target of choice for phishing attacks. Almost\nevery fifth attempted visit to a phishing page blocked by Kaspersky products has been\nrelated to online store phishing.\nPhishing attacks against PayPal users soared from 26.8% in 2019 to 38.7% in 2020.\nThe longtime leader of the category, Visa, dropped to the fourth place with 10.2% of\nphishing attacks against users of payment systems successfully prevented by\nKaspersky in 2020.\n\n**PC:**\n\nIn 2020, 625,364 users were attacked by banking Trojans – 148,579 less from 773,943\nin 2019.\nThis year, users in Russia, Germany and Kazakhstan were the most frequent targets of\nfinancial malware.\nZbot is still the most widespread banking malware (22.2 % of attacked users), the\nsecond place is now held by CliptoShuffler (15.3%), with Emotet (14.5%) in the third\nplace as before.\n36% of users hit by banking malware are corporate ones – an increase of one\npercentage point from the previous year.\n\n**Mobile:**\n\nThis year, the number of users attacked by Android banking malware rapidly dropped\nby more than 55%: from 675,772 in 2019 to 294,158 in 2020.\nJapan, Taiwan and Spain ended up with the highest percentage of users hit by Android\nbanking malware.\n\n## Financial phishing\n\nFinancial phishing is one of the most popular tools used by cybercriminals to make money.\nIts prevalence is explained by the fact that it does not require much investment or technical\nexpertise. In most cases, successful scammers win access either to the victim’s money or\ndata that can be sold or otherwise monetized.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Percentage of financial phishing attacks (of the overall phishing attacks) detected by_\n_[Kaspersky, 2016 – 2020 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/03/31105720/01-en-financial-report.png)_\n\nIn 2020, Kaspersky anti-phishing technologies detected 434,898,635 attempted visits to\nvarious types of phishing pages. As can be seen from the graph above, 37.2% of those were\nrelated to financial phishing – 14.2 p.p. less than the figure registered in 2019 (51.4%). The\nlowest financial phishing percentage in the past five years.\n\nBy “financial phishing” we mean not banking phishing alone but several other types as well.\nFor one, there are the ‘payment systems’, which include pages mimicking the well-known\npayment brands like PayPal, Visa, MasterCard, American Express and others. There are\nalso the ‘e-shops’ which include online stores and auction sites like Amazon, Apple store,\nSteam, E-bay and others.\n\nIn 2019, the financial phishing cases detected by Kaspersky products were distributed as\nfollows:\n\n_[Distribution of financial phishing cases by type in 2019 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/03/31105748/02-en-financial-report.png)_\n\n_[Distribution of financial phishing cases by type in 2020 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/03/31105815/03-en-financial-report.png)_\n\nThe year 2020 was definitely a unique one when it comes to financial phishing. One year\nback, we reported an increase in bank-related phishing from less than 22% to almost 30%. In\n2020, banking phishing reached only 10.72 percent of the total. The e-shops, with 7.57% in\n2019, on the contrary, almost tripled reaching 18.12%. Kaspersky experts connect these\nchanges with the lockdown measures due to the pandemic – at home most of the time,\npeople turned to online shopping and digital entertainment. Thus, growing demand from the\nusers has led to increased “supply” from the cybercriminals. It should be noted that, while\nonline shopping proved the most appealing field for scammers, payment systems were not\nthat much of a lure – their share barely reaching 8.41%.\n\n2019 statistics on payment systems:\n\n_The most frequently used brands in ‘payment systems’ financial phishing schemes in 2019_\n_[(download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/03/31110013/04-en-financial-report.png)_\n\nAs can be observed from the graph above, the users of Visa Inc. (37.6%) were targeted the\nmost in 2019. PayPal came in second with 26.8%, while MasterCard closed the top 3.\n\n_The most frequently used brands in ‘payment systems’ financial phishing schemes in 2020_\n_[(download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/03/31110044/05-en-financial-report.png)_\n\nIn 2020, the PayPal brand name (38.7%) was used for scam more than those of any other\npopular payment system. Its share grew by 12 p.p.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Example of a phishing page targeting PayPal users_**\n\nMastercard made it to the second place slightly increasing its share from 16.3% to 17.5%.\nThe third and the fourth places, with a tiny difference between them, were taken by American\nExpress (10.6%) and Visa (10.2%). As was observed, in 2020, scammers mimicked Visa Inc.\n3.5 times less than in 2019 (37.6%).\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Example of a phishing page targeting Visa users_**\n\nIn 2019, we analyzed the ‘e- shop’ brands most frequently used by cybercriminals in financial\nphishing schemes. The results showed Apple (42.8%) to be the number one choice for\nscam. The online stores Amazon (23.6%) and eBay (14.2%) took the second and the third\nplace respectively.\n\n_[Brands most frequently used in ‘e-shop’ financial phishing schemes, 2019 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/04/01101139/06-en-financial-report_1.png)_\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_Examples of phishing pages based on the online store brands most used by_**\n**_cybercriminals_**\n\nIn 2020, as the e-shop phishing continued to grow, Amazon made it to the first place with\n27.84% of total. Challenged by the popular online store, Apple (27.07%) stepped down to the\nsecond place, its share reduced by 15 p.p. Steam and eBay swapped their positions –\nSteam (14.90%) finished third, and eBay (12.85%) fourth.\n\n_[Brands most frequently used in ‘e-shop’ financial phishing schemes, 2020 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/04/01100937/07-en-financial-report_1.png)_\n\n## Banking malware for PC\n\nIn this study, we analyze the banking malware that steals the credentials used to access\nonline banking or payment system accounts and to intercept one-time passwords.\n\nAfter an upsurge of malware activity in October 2016, when as many as 1,494,236 users\nwere hit, we observed a gradual decline in the number of users attacked with banking\nmalware. 2020 was no exception. The number of attacked users has declined from 773,943\nin 2019 to 625,364 – almost a 20% drop.\n\nThe reduction can be explained by the fact that attacks are becoming more targeted –\ncybercriminals now prefer to attack large businesses. Yet common users and small entities\ncontinue to fall victim to cybercriminal groups such as Zbot, CliptoShuffler, Emotet, RTM and\nothers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Dynamic change in the number of unique users attacked with banking malware 2018 – 2020_\n_[(download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/03/31110219/08-en-financial-report.png)_\n\n### The main actors\n\nEvery year we detect multiple families of banking malware: some of them become outdated,\nsome, on the contrary, gain popularity among cybercriminals. Below is a list of top 10 most\nactive banking malware families detected in 2019. The leading ones were Zbot (21.6%),\nRTM (19.8%), Emotet (12.6%), CliptoShuffler (5.6%) and Trickster (5.5%).\n\n_[TOP 10 most widespread banking malware families in 2019 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/03/31110245/09-en-financial-report.png)_\n\nThis year we continued tracking the most active banking malware families. It is quite\nnoteworthy that only four of them (Zbot, CliptoShuffler, Emotet and RTM) account for more\nthan one half of the attacked users. Below is a list of top 10 banking malware families we\ndetected in 2020.\n\n_[TOP 10 most widespread banking malware families in 2020 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/03/31110312/10-en-financial-report.png)_\n\nWhile Zbot (22.2%) still enjoys the status of the most used malware in the financial sphere,\nthere were some changes in the list. RTM, with 10.5%, dropped from the second to the\nfourth place, while two other families, CliptoShuffler (15.3%) and Emotet (14.5%), both\nclimbed higher in 2020. Notably, Gozi (3.3%), the second most active family just two years\nago, was pushed out to the ninth place.\n\nWhat is more, year 2020 has also been special for expansion of regional threat actors into\n[the outside world. Thus, the four large Brazilian families we have called the Tétrade went](https://securelist.com/the-tetrade-brazilian-banking-malware/97779/)\nglobal targeting not only Latin America but Asian and European countries as well.\n\n### Geography of attacked users\n\nTo assess and compare the degree of computer infection risk faced by users in different\ncountries of the world, we have calculated for each country the proportion of Kaspersky\nproduct users faced by the threat during the period of report versus the total number of users\nattacked by financial malware.\n\nTraditionally, more than half of all users hit with banking malware in 2019 and 2020 came\nfrom 10 countries. In 2019, the top 10 was as follows:\n\nRussian Federation 33.6%\n\nGermany 7.4%\n\nChina 3.3%\n\nBrazil 3%\n\n\n-----\n\nIndia 3%\n\nMexico 3%\n\nVietnam 2.70%\n\nItaly 2.60%\n\nKazakhstan 2%\n\nUnited States 2%\n\nIn 2019, Russia’s share reached 33.6% of the total, Germany finishing second with 7.4%,\nand China closing the top three with 3.3%.\n\nIn 2020, the situation was as follows:\n\nRussian Federation 26.6%\n\nGermany 4.5%\n\nKazakhstan 4.1%\n\nBrazil 3.4%\n\nChina 3.4%\n\nItaly 3.3%\n\nIndia 3.1%\n\nMexico 2.8%\n\nVietnam 2.8%\n\nUzbekistan 2.3%\n\nAs can be seen from the chart, despite the decline Russia (26.6%) and Germany (4.5%) still\nhold the first and second places in the top 10. Notably, Russia’s figures always tend to be the\nhighest due to the fact that most Kaspersky users are located in Russia. Kazakhstan, which\nused to be 9 with 2%, this year broke into the top three having added 2 more percentageth\npoints.\n\n### Types of users attacked\n\nIt can be noticed that financial malware becomes more corporate-oriented. This year we\nobserved that 36% of users attacked by banking malware are corporate ones – one\npercentage point up from the previous year. This partly confirms our hypothesis about\n\n\n-----\n\ncybercriminals shifting their attention to the corporate sector. Still, the increase is relatively\nsmall, and we expect the redistribution of attacks between corporate and private users to\nclear up in the near future.\n\n_[Corporate vs consumer product users, 2019–2020 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/03/31110344/11-en-financial-report.png)_\n\nAll in all, in 2020, companies became more vulnerable due to the restrictions for onsite work\nand staff, coupled with increased number of employees using the corporate network\nremotely. The hasty transition to teleworking has affected the corporate security – most\nbusinesses were not ready to go online. Some of them lacked the devices, so employees\nhad to use their home computers for work. Lack of online security training, default laptop\nconfigurations left as is, vulnerable remote access connections – together these factors have\npaved way to all sorts of attacks, including banking malware scams.\n\n## Сryptocurrency related cyberthreats in 2020\n\nThree years ago, in 2018, cryptocurrencies made the hottest topic and turned the eyes of the\nwhole cybersecurity community to the new danger. We have analyzed the hidden mining\nsoftware cybercriminals spread to coin money at the users’ cost, and found that today the\nmalicious activity is not that widespread.\n\n_[Number of users attacked by mining malware in 2019 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/03/31110412/12-en-financial-report.png)_\n\n_[Number of users attacked by mining malware in 2020 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/03/31110441/13-en-financial-report.png)_\n\n_[Geography of mining attacks, 2020 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/03/31110508/18-en-financial-report.png)_\n\nThus, in 2020, we continued to observe a downward trend for this type of threat. Yet by the\nend of the year the numbers reached a certain plateau, and we even saw local trend\nreversals. It is likely that the sharp increase in cryptocurrency prices at the end of 2020 may\nboost the threat in early 2021. Moreover, due to the COVID crisis, we may yet see some\neconomies collapsing and local currencies plummeting in 2021, which would turn\ncryptomining a lot more attractive.\n\n## Mobile banking malware\n\nAndroid banking malware is a well-known threat Kaspersky experts have been analyzing for\nyears. Last year was a dramatic one in terms of mobile banking malware. As stated in our\n[previous annual report, in 2019, the number of users hit by it dropped to just over 675](https://securelist.com/financial-cyberthreats-in-2019/96692/)\nthousand from around 1.8 million in 2018.\n\n_[Number of users attacked with Android banking malware, 2018 – 2019 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/03/31105841/14-en-financial-report.png)_\n\nIn 2020, we observed a continuation of this trend as the number of attacked users decreased\nby more than 55% to 294,158.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Number of users attacked with Android banking malware, 2019 – 2020 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/03/31110602/15-en-financial-report.png)_\n\nTo get a better view of the reasons behind these dramatic changes, Kaspersky experts took\na closer look at the landscape and reviewed the most widespread families over the year. In\n2019, the situation was as follows:\n\n_[Most widespread Android banking malware in 2019 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/03/31110638/16-en-financial-report.png)_\n\nIn 2020, Asacub’s (25.6%) share is still the weightiest. Yet it shrank by 18.8 percentage\npoints since 2019. Agent (18.0%) is still in the second position, although a bit lighter from the\nyear before. Svpeng (12.8%), which mostly hunts for the administrator rights on the infected\n[device, this year was challenged by Rotexy (17.9%), in which the banking Trojan’s features](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/rotexy-banker-blocker/24733/)\nare combined with those of a ransomware blocker.\n\n_[Most widespread Android banking malware in 2020 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/03/31110710/17-en-financial-report.png)_\n\nAll in all, 2020 was rich in new mobile banking malware. Let us give a brief overview of this\nyear’s major findings:\n\n**[Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Ghimob.a](https://securelist.com/ghimob-tetrade-threat-mobile-devices/99228/)**\nNew banking malware from the Tétrade group that went global this year and attacked\nbanks, exchanges, cryptocurrency exchangers and fintech organizations in Brazil,\nParaguay, Peru, Portugal, Germany, Angola, and Mozambique. Ghimob was able to\nspy on a total of 153 mobile apps, which is impressive for a banking Trojan.\n**[Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Gorgona.a](https://twitter.com/ThreatFabric/status/1285144962695340032)**\nThe malware mimics Google Play and uses the notification panel to attract the user’s\nattention. It can make and redirect calls, execute USSD commands, install additional\napps and block the device, if needed. If granted the permission to use Accessibility, it\ncan get even more rights, for example, to receive and process text messages. Thus, it\ncan gain control of the two-factor authentication. Uses TCP for C2 communication.\nTends to target banks in Turkey.\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Knobot.a](https://twitter.com/ThreatFabric/status/1240664876558823424)**\nThe new financial threat market player. Alongside phishing windows and interception of\nthe two-factor authentication messages, the Trojan offers several features not typical of\nfinancial threats. For example, a mechanism for interception of device PIN code\nthrough Accessibility services.\nIronically, it asks its victim to delegate the rights and even provides a small instruction\non how to do it.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_A screenshot of Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Knobot.a on user’s phone_**\n\n### Geography of attacked users\n\nTop 10 countries by percentage of users hit by Android banking malware in 2019:\n\nRussian Federation 0.72%\n\nSouth Africa 0.66%\n\nAustralia 0.59%\n\nSpain 0.29%\n\nTajikistan 0.21%\n\nTurkey 0.20%\n\nUnited States 0.18%\n\nItaly 0.17%\n\nUkraine 0.17%\n\nArmenia 0.16%\n\nTop 10 countries by percentage of users hit by Android banking malware in 2020:\n\nJapan 2.83%\n\nTaiwan (province of China) 0.87%\n\nSpain 0.77%\n\nItaly 0.71%\n\nTurkey 0.60%\n\nKorea 0.34%\n\nRussian Federation 0.25%\n\nTajikistan 0.21%\n\nPoland 0.17%\n\n\n-----\n\nAustralia 0.15%\n\nAs can be seen from the statistics, all the countries were completely reshuffled year on year.\nRussia from it top position in 2019 moved to the 7 place in 2020. Armenia, which used toth\nclose the 2019 chart, left it altogether. On the other hand, Japan (2.83%) and Taiwan\n(0.87%), not even mentioned in 2019, rapidly gained more users hit by Android banking\nmalware and made it to the top. Meanwhile Spain (0.77%) ousted Australia from the third\nplace with almost 3 thousand of affected users.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe year 2020 has shown that cybercriminals can easily adapt to new realities of the\nchanging world. They keep updating their malware with new features and improving the\ndetection avoidance techniques. The general statistics in all the areas we have analyzed (PC\nand mobile malware, phishing) is on the downward trend, which is a good sign.\n\nWe have observed that, in 2020, the phishing scammers have switched their attention from\nbanks to e-shops. This trend is closely related to the pandemic, which has greatly changed\nthe public’s attitude towards online shopping: criminals have marked its growing popularity\nand turned focus on it. We have registered a slight increase of the share of malware attacks\nagainst corporate users. The emerging trend of banking Trojans targeting corporate users is\nalso of concern, as such attacks are likely to bring more problems than attacks on\nindividuals. At the same time, the regional scam factories targeting financial organizations\nare increasingly reaching the global level, potentially resulting in more growth in 2021. Thus,\neven though the general statistics look positive, we have to consider the massive threat\nlandscape still faced by financial organizations.\n\n**For protection against financial threats, Kaspersky recommends users to:**\n\nInstall only applications obtained from reliable sources, such as the official websites;\nCheck the access rights and permissions requested by the application – do not grant\nthem if they fail to match the app’s feature set;\nNever follow links from spam messages and never open documents attached to them;\nInstall a trusted security solution, such as Kaspersky Security Cloud – it will protect you\nfrom a broad range of financial cyberthreats.\n\n**To protect your business from financial malware, Kaspersky security experts**\n**recommend:**\n\n[Introduce cybersecurity awareness training for your employees, particularly those](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/security-awareness)\nresponsible for accounting, to teach them to detect phishing pages and improve the\ndigital literacy of staff in general;\nFor critical user profiles, such as those in financial departments, enable the default\ndeny mode for web resources to ensure that only legitimate ones can be accessed;\n\n\n-----\n\nInstall the latest updates and patches for all the software you use;\nFor protection from complex threat and targeted attacks, install the anti-APT and EDR\nsolutions for network threat detection, incident investigation and timely recovery action.\nProvide your SOC team with access to the latest threat intelligence and regular upskill\n[training.
