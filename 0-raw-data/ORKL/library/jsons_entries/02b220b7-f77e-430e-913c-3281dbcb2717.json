APT10 is a Chinese cyber espionage group that FireEye has tracked since 2009, and they have a history of targeting\nJapanese entities.\n\nIn this campaign, the group sent spear phishing emails containing malicious documents that led to the installation of the\n[UPPERCUT backdoor. This backdoor is well-known in the security community as ANEL, and it used to come in beta or RC (release](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/chessmaster-adds-updated-tools-to-its-arsenal/)\ncandidate) until recently. Part of this blog post will discuss the updates and differences we have observed across multiple versions\nof this backdoor.\n\n## Attack Overview\n\nThe attack starts with Microsoft Word documents containing a malicious VBA macro being attached to spear phishing emails.\nAlthough the contents of the malicious documents are unreadable (see Figure 3), the Japanese titles are related to maritime,\ndiplomatic, and North Korean issues. Table 1 shows the UPPERCUT indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n\n**File Name** **MD5** **Size** **C2**\n\n自民党海洋総合戦略小委員会が政府に提言申し入れ.doc 4f83c01e8f7507d23c67ab085bf79e97 843022 eservake.jetos[.]com\n\nGovernment Recommendations from the Liberal Democratic Party’s 82.221.100.52\nComprehensive Strategic Maritime Subcommittee\n\n151.106.53.147\n\nグテマラ大使講演会案内状.doc f188936d2c8423cf064d6b8160769f21 720384 eservake.jetos[.]com\n\nInvitation to Lecture by Guatemalan Ambassador 151.106.53.147\n\n153.92.210.208\n\n米国接近に揺れる北朝鮮内部.doc cca227f70a64e1e7fcf5bccdc6cc25dd 733184 eservake.jetos[.]com\n\nNorth Korean interior swayed by the approach of the United States 153.92.210.208\n\n167.99.121.203\n\nTable 1: UPPERCUT IoCs\n\n[For the North Korean lure, a news article with an identical title was readily available online. It’s also worth noting that in the](http://www.worldtimes.co.jp/column/88334.html)\nGuatemalan lure, the attacker used an unusual spelling of Guatemala in Japanese. The top result of a Google search using the\nsame spelling led us to the event website for the lecture of the Guatemalan Ambassador, held in August 2018. Figure 1 shows the\nscreenshot of the event page.\n\n|File Name|MD5|Size|C2|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|自民党海洋総合戦略小委員会が政府に提言申し入れ.doc Government Recommendations from the Liberal Democratic Party’s Comprehensive Strategic Maritime Subcommittee|4f83c01e8f7507d23c67ab085bf79e97|843022|eservake.jetos[.]com 82.221.100.52 151.106.53.147|\n|グテマラ大使講演会案内状.doc Invitation to Lecture by Guatemalan Ambassador|f188936d2c8423cf064d6b8160769f21|720384|eservake.jetos[.]com 151.106.53.147 153.92.210.208|\n|米国接近に揺れる北朝鮮内部.doc North Korean interior swayed by the approach of the United States|cca227f70a64e1e7fcf5bccdc6cc25dd|733184|eservake.jetos[.]com 153.92.210.208 167.99.121.203|\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Event Website for the Lecture of Guatemala Ambassador\n\nFigure 2 shows the macro function that displays the lure document. At the bottom of this function, we can see the readable text that\nmatches the contact information found in Figure 1. Thus, people who would have an interest in Latin American issues may have\nbeen the targets of this campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Macro to display lure document\n\nThe initial Word documents were password protected, likely in an effort to bypass detection. Once the password (delivered in the\nbody of the email) is entered, the users are presented with a document that will request users to enable the malicious macro, as\nshown in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3: Lure document\n\nFigure 4 shows what happens when the malicious macro is executed.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Macro to install UPPERCUT\n\nThe execution workflow is as follows:\n\n1.   The macro drops three PEM files, padre1.txt, padre2.txt, and padre3.txt, to the victim’s %TEMP% folder and then copies them\nfrom %TEMP% to the %AllUserProfile% folder.\n\n2.   The macro decodes the dropped files using Windows certutil.exe with the following commands (certutil.exe is a legitimate\nbuilt-in command-line program to manage certificates in Windows):\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\" /c certutil -decode C:\\ProgramData\\padre1.txt C:\\ProgramData\\\\GUP.txt\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\" /c certutil -decode C:\\ProgramData\\padre2.txt C:\\ProgramData\\\\libcurl.txt\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\" /c certutil -decode C:\\ProgramData\\padre3.txt C:\\ProgramData\\\\3F2E3AB9\n\n3.   The macro creates a copy of the files with their proper extensions using Extensible Storage Engine Utilities (esentutil.exe) with\nthe following commands (esentutil.exe is also a legitimate program that is pre-installed in Windows):\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\esentutl.exe\" /y C:\\ProgramData\\\\GUP.txt /d C:\\ProgramData\\GUP.exe /o\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\esentutl.exe\" /y C:\\ProgramData\\\\libcurl.txt /d C:\\ProgramData\\libcurl.dll /o\n\nThe dropped files include the following:\n\nGUP.exe : GUP, a free (LGPL) Generic Updater. GUP is an open source binary used by Notepad++ for software updates.\nThe version used here is version 4.1 digitally signed by Notepad++, as shown in Figure 5.\nlibcurl.dll: Malicious Loader DLL\n3F2E3AB9: Encrypted shellcode\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Notepad++ signed updater\n\n4.   The macro launches the legitimate executable GUP.exe.\n\nThe executable sideloads the malicious DLL (libcurl.dll), which decrypts and runs shellcode (3F2E3AB9) located in the same\nfolder.\nThe shellcode decodes and decompresses another DLL, which is an updated variant of UPPERCUT. Before decoding the\nDLL, the shellcode uses an anti-debug technique based on ntdll_NtSetInformationThread which causes the thread to be\ndetached from the debugger, as shown in Figure 6. The DLL is then loaded into memory and the randomly named exported\nfunction is called.\n\nFigure 6: Anti-debug technique used by shellcode\n\n5.   The macro deletes the initially dropped .txt files using Windows esentutl.exe and changes the document text to an embedded\nmessage.\n\nThe complete attack overview is shown in Figure 7.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Attack overview\n\n[Several threat actors leverage the technique of using Windows certutil.exe for payload decoding, and APT10 continues to employ](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/12/targeted-attack-in-middle-east-by-apt34.html)\nthis technique.\n\n## Evolution of UPPERCUT\n\nFigure 8 shows the timeline of updates for UPPERCUT. The PE compile time of loaders and the create time of droppers (Word\ndocuments) are plotted in the graph. The compile time of loaders in the newer version(s) are not shown here since the timestamps\nare overwritten and filled with zeroes. We don’t have visibility into UPPERCUT 5.2.x series, but it’s possible that minor revisions\nwere released every few months between December 2017 and May 2018.\n\nFigure 8: Timeline of UPPERCUT updates\n\nUnlike previous versions, the exported function names are randomized in the latest version (Table 2).\n\n**Encoded Payload** **Decoded Payload**\n\n**MD5** **Size** **Import Hash** **Exported Function** **Version**\n\naa3f303c3319b14b4829fe2faa5999c1 322164 182ee99b4f0803628c30411b1faa9992 l7MF25T96n45qOGWX 5 3 2\n\n|Encoded Payload|Col2|Decoded Payload|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|MD5|Size|Import Hash|Exported Function|Version|\n\n\n-----\n\n|fce54b4886cac5c61eda1e7605483ca3|345812|c1942a0ca397b627019dace26eca78d8|WcuH|5.4.1|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\nTable 2: Static characteristics of UPPERCUT\n\nAnother new feature in the latest UPPERCUT sample is that the malware sends an error code in the Cookie header if it fails to\nreceive the HTTP response from the command and control (C2) server. The error code is the value returned by the GetLastError\nfunction and sent in the next beacon. This was likely included to help the attackers understand the problem if the backdoor is\nunable to receive a response (Figure 9). This Cookie header is a unique indicator that can be used for network-based detection.\n\nFigure 9: Example of callback\n\nEarlier versions of UPPERCUT used the hard-coded string “this is the encrypt key” for Blowfish encryption when communicating\nwith a C2. However, in the latest version, the keys are hard-coded uniquely for each C2 address and use the C2’s calculated MD5\nhash to determine which key to use, as shown in Figure 10.\n\nFigure 10: Blowfish key generation\n\nFor instance, Table 3 lists the hard-coded C2 addresses, their MD5 hash, and the corresponding Blowfish key in the decoded\npayload of 126067d634d94c45084cbe1d9873d895.\n\n|C2|MD5|Blowfish Key|\n|---|---|---|\n|hxxp[:]//151.106.53[.]147/VxQG|f613846eb5bed227ec1a5f8df7e678d0|bdc4b9f5af9868e028dd0adc10099a4e6656e9f0ad12b2e75a30f5ca0e34489d|\n|hxxp[:]//153.92.210[.]208/wBNh1|50c60f37922ff2ff8733aaeaa9802da5|fb9f7fb3c709373523ff27824ed6a31d800e275ec5217d8a11024a3dffb577dd|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Default|Default|f12df6984bb65d18e2561bd017df29ee1cf946efa5e510802005aeee9035dd53|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\nTable 3: Example of Blowfish keys\n\nIn this example, the MD5 hash of hxxp[:]//151.106.53[.]147/VxQG will be f613846eb5bed227ec1a5f8df7e678d0. When the malware\ninteracts with this URL, bdc4b9f5af9868e028dd0adc10099a4e6656e9f0ad12b2e75a30f5ca0e34489d will be selected as a Blowfish\nkey. If the MD5 hash of the URL does not match any of the listed hashes, then the default key\nf12df6984bb65d18e2561bd017df29ee1cf946efa5e510802005aeee9035dd53 will be used.\n\nAnother difference in the network traffic generated from the malware is that the encoded proxy information has been added in the\nURL query values during the C2 communication. Table 4 shows the parameters sent to C2 server from the backdoor in the newer\nversions. These are sent via POST request, as shown in Figure 9.\n\nTable 4: URL parameters\n\nAdditionally, the command string is hashed using the same RGPH hashing algorithm as before. Two more commands,\n0xD290626C85FB1CE3 and 0x409C7A89CFF0A727, are supported in the newer versions (Table 5).\n\n**Commands** **Description**\n\n0x97A168D9697D40DD Download and validate file (XXHash comparison) from C2 server\n\n0x7CF812296CCC68D5 Upload file to C2 server\n\n0x652CB1CEFF1C0A00 Load PE file\n\n0x27595F1F74B55278 Download, validate (XXHash comparison), execute file, and send output to C2 server\n\n0xD290626C85FB1CE3 Format the current timestamp\n\n0x409C7A89CFF0A727 Capture the desktop screenshot in PNG format and send it to C2\n\nNone of the above The received buffer is executed via cmd.exe and the output is then sent to the C2 server\n\nTable 5: Supported commands\n\n|Commands|Description|\n|---|---|\n|0x97A168D9697D40DD|Download and validate file (XXHash comparison) from C2 server|\n|0x7CF812296CCC68D5|Upload file to C2 server|\n|0x652CB1CEFF1C0A00|Load PE file|\n|0x27595F1F74B55278|Download, validate (XXHash comparison), execute file, and send output to C2 server|\n|0xD290626C85FB1CE3|Format the current timestamp|\n|0x409C7A89CFF0A727|Capture the desktop screenshot in PNG format and send it to C2|\n|None of the above|The received buffer is executed via cmd.exe and the output is then sent to the C2 server|\n\n\n-----\n\n, g g y yp y,\nharder for analysts to detect and decrypt the backdoor’s network communications. This shows that APT10 is very capable of\nmaintaining and updating their malware.\n\nTo mitigate the threat, users are advised to disable Office macros in their settings and not to open documents from unknown\nsources. FireEye Multi-Vector Execution (MVX) engine is able to recognize and block this threat with the following detection names:\n\nAPT.Backdoor.Win.UPPERCUT\nFE_APT_Backdoor_Win32_UPPERCUT\n\n\n-----",
