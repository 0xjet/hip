Its primary targets are toplevel government agencies and civil and military organizations. Naikon is one of the most\nactive APTs in Asia, especially around the South China Sea, and has been spying on entities\nin the area for around five years, since at least 2010.\n\n## Who are the victims of these attacks?\n\nKaspersky Lab has detected Naikon malware in the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Singapore, Nepal, Thailand, Laos and China.\n\n## Am I at risk?\n\nNaikon’s targets are hit using traditional spear-phishing techniques, with emails carrying\nattachments designed to be of interest to the potential victim. This attachment might look like\na Word document, but is in fact an executable file with a double extension. You might be a\n\n\n-----\n\ntarget of Naikon if the following risk factors are familiar to you:\n\n**Risk factors:**\n\nIf you work for/with governments/military in APAC\nYou possess valuable information\nIf you receive and read hundreds of emails, open attachments\n\n## Are normal consumers at risk?\n\nWe haven’t seen the Naikon group attacking ordinary consumers, however the malware\nused by the group could easily be turned against anyone running Windows and using email..\nBasically, if someone is connected with an individual of interest to the Naikon APT, they\ncould be targeted.\n\n## How can I protect myself?\n\nKaspersky Lab advises organizations to protect themselves against Naikon as follows:\n\nDon’t open attachments and links from people you don’t know\nUse an advanced anti-malware solution\nIf you are unsure about the attachment, try to open it in a sandbox\nMake sure you have an up-to-date version of your operating system with all patches\ninstalled\n\nKaspersky\nNaikon is a threat actor that appears to be Chinese-speaking. Its primary targets are toplevel government agencies and civil and military organizations.\n\n\n-----",
