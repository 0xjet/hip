Based on code similarity\nand shared tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), the team assessed this activity to\nbe possibly linked to a Chinese-based group known as APT40, or Leviathan. The group’s\ncampaign appears to target Malaysian government officials with a lure regarding the\n2020 Malaysian political crisis.\n\n## Anatomy of the attack\n\nFigure 1: Original image Figure 2: Lure document image\n\nTo initiate their advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign, the group likely delivered a\nMicrosoft Word document as a phishing lure attachment. The image used in the lure\n(Figure 2) appears to be crafted from a broadcast announcement shared by a Malaysian\nblogger (Figure 1). The lure image includes the same broadcast time, but the date and\nspeech topic are removed. Once this attachment is opened, a decoy document is\npresented while behind the scenes, taking the following actions:\n\nThe lure document downloads the remote template RemoteLoad.dotm\n\n\n-----\n\nThe remote template executes VBA macro code\nThe VBA macro code unpacks and executes two embedded base64-encoded DLLs\n(sl1.tmp and sl2.tmp) to c:\\users\\public\\\n\nThis technique is known as template injection, which you may recall from our Playing\ndefense against Gamaredon Group blog post. This an effective approach used by\nadversaries to bypass perimeter controls such as email gateways.\n\nFigure 3: Remote template injection – RemoteLoad.dotm\n\nFigure 4: Obfuscation of MZ/PE header base64\nBoth embedded DLLs ( sl1.tmp and `sl2.tmp ) are similar and export the same`\nfunction names: `RCT and` `RCP . The first DLL ( sl1.tmp ) is used to download a benign`\nexecutable called `LogiMailApp.exe and an associated library` `LogiMail.dll, and the`\nsecond DLL ( sl2.tmp ) is used to execute `LogiMailApp.exe, which automatically`\nattempts to execute `LogiMail.dll due to an inherent DLL search order vulnerability`\nwe’ll cover shortly.\n\n\n**File name** **File**\n**type**\n\n\n**Size**\n**(bytes)**\n\n\n**MD5** **Compile time**\n\n\nLogiMailApp.exe\n\nLogiMail.dll\n\n\nWin32\nEXE\n\nWin32\nDLL\n\n\n311656 850a163ce1f9cff0367854038d8cfa7e\n\n105984 b5a5dc78fb392fae927e9461888f354d\n\n\n2012-09-26\n22:13:13+00:00\n\n2020-06-03\n04:08:29+00:00\n\n\n-----\n\nsl1.tmp Win32\nDLL\n\nsl2.tmp Win32\nDLL\n\n\n3072 ccbdda7217ba439dfb6bbc6c3bd594f8\n\n3072 dbfa006d64f39cde78b0efda1373309c\n\n\n2019-11-29\n17:15:29+00:00\n\n2019-11-29\n21:23:44+00:00\n\n\nTable 1: Dropped files metadata\n\nFigure 5: Download and execution of LogiMailApp.exe and LogiMail.dll\nThis implementation stood out to our researchers due to a behavioral idiosyncrasy:\n\nThe Microsoft Office application winword.exe loads sl1.tmp and sl2.tmp DLLs uses\nthe LoadLibraryA method, which is moderately rare\nThese DLLs run explicit commands or install a payload from a URL using the\nCallWindowProcA method, which appears to be exceptionally rare\nBoth DLLs are deleted after execution\n\nFigure 6: Download and execution module deletion\n\n## Embedded DLLs\n\nThe embedded DLLs, `sl1.tmp and` `sl2.tmp, have very limited functionality —`\nexporting the RCP and RCT functions. The RCP function implements the `WinExec`\nmethod to execute commands where the RCT function uses the `URLDownloadToFileA`\nmethod to download a file from a specified URL.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Exported functions – RCP and RCT\n\n## DLL side-loading a backdoor\n```\nLogiMailApp.exe, which is downloaded by sl1.tmp and executed by sl2.tmp, is\n\n```\nvulnerable to a form of DLL search-order hijacking called side-loading, which\nautomatically searches for and executes `LogiMail.dll if found in the same directory.`\nForms of DLL search-order hijacking can be used with many third-party software\napplications. In this case, search-order hijacking was used to load a backdoor that exports\nthe following notable functions:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: LogiMail.dll exports table\n\nFigure 9: LogiMailApp.exe – Logitech camera software\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: LogiMail.dll side-loading\nThe adversary-created binary LogiMail.dll exports the function `DllGetClassObject`\nthat contains critical logic for the execution flow of this sample:\n\n1. Download an AES-encrypted second stage object to `%TEMP%\\~liseces1.pcs`\n2. Derive a 128-bit AES key and initialization vector from SHA256 of a hardcoded\n\nstring\n3. Read and decrypt `%TEMP%\\~liseces1.pcs in memory using the ReadFile and`\n\nCryptDecrypt functions\n4. Delete `%TEMP%\\~liseces1.pcs from disk`\n\nFigure 11: Encrypted URL and hardcoded key\n\nFigure 12: Decrypted second stage URL and temp staging file\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13: Second stage download, in-memory decryption, execution, and file deletion\n\n## Second stage backdoor\n\nThe decrypted second stage backdoor is mapped into memory and then its original entry\npoint (OEP) is called, thus bypassing successful detections based on file system scanning.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14: LogiMail.dll — Resolving needed functions to map second stage PE into\nmemory\n\nFigure 15: The second stage implant mapped in LogiMailApp.exe memory\nBoth the payload staging server and the second stage infrastructure use dynamic DNS:\n\nFigure 16: C2 HTTP POST request to /postlogin\nThis payload supports the following capabilities:\n\nBasic anti-debug checks\nSystem and user discovery\nExecution via command line\nFile discovery, upload, and download\nPersistence via run registry\nEncrypt C2 traffic using same AES key\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17: System and user discovery\n\nFigure 18: Execution via command-line\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19: File discovery, upload, and download\n\n## Possible APT40/Leviathan connection\n\nEarlier in the year, the Malaysian Computer Emergency Response Team (MyCERT)\n[issued an advisory related to espionage activity targeting their country. The report listed](https://www.mycert.org.my/portal/advisory?id=MA-774.022020)\ndifferent TTPs and included multiple samples and other technical indicators that align\nwith a threat group known as APT40/Leviathan.\n\nAt a high level, this sample follows the continued trend of targeting Malaysian victims\nusing specific TTPs such as remote templates, employing macros, using DLL side-loading\ntechniques, and leveraging an in-memory implant with dynamic DNS for command and\ncontrol. More specifically, the second stage implant from this lure shares unique strings\nand URL references and contains similar functionality that correlates with the previous\nreporting for APT40/Leviathan. With these similarities, our Intelligence & Analytics\nTeam assesses with moderate confidence that this activity is linked to APT40/Leviathan.\n\nImplant String Similarities with MyCERT Sample:\n\n/list_direction\n/post_document\n/post_login\nOpen Remote File %s Failed For: %s\nOpen Pipe Failed %s\nDownload Read Path Failed %s\n%02X-%02X-%02X-%02X-%02X-%02X\nSoftware\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\nntkd\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20: Shared strings with MyCERT sample - 8a133a382499e08811dceadcbe07\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this post, we highlighted a recent sample that most likely represents the work of a\nhighly organized adversary. Activity groups like this are significant for everyone to take\nnotice of, if only because they represent a higher maturity level of post-exploit innovation.\nTheir cutting edge TTPs today end up being everyone’s run of the mill tomorrow; it’s\nimportant to learn from these events.\n\nWe hope that by sharing some of these insights, we can help raise awareness and continue\nto focus on protecting the world's data from attack. To enable organizations further, we’ve\nadded all the observed MITRE ATT&CK techniques and indicators of compromise®\n(IoCs) below.\n\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK techniques®\n\n[T1193 - Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193/)\n[T1221 - Template Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221/)\n[T1060 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1060/)\n[T1073 - DLL Side-Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1073/)\n[T1129 - Execution through Module Load](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1129/)\n[T1055 - Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/)\n[T1107 - File Deletion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1107/)\n[T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140/)\n[T1059 - Command-Line Interface](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n#### File names and paths\n```\nBubar Parlimen.zip\nBubar Parlimen.docx\nRemoteLoad.dotm\nC:\\Users\\Public\\sl1.tmp\nC:\\Users\\Public\\sl2.tmp\nC:\\Users\\*\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\~liseces1.pcs\nC:\\Users\\*\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\LogiMailApp.exe\nC:\\Users\\*\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\LogiMail.dll\n\n Registry keys\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\ntkd\n\n URLs\nhxxps[:]//armybar[.]hopto[.]org/LogiMail.dll\nhxxps[:]//armybar[.]hopto[.]org/LogiMailApp[.]exe\nhxxps[:]//armybar[.]hopto[.]org/Encrypted\nhxxp[:]//tomema.myddns[.]me/postlogin\nhxxp[:]//tomema[.]myddns[.]me/list_direction\nhxxp[:]//tomema[.]myddns[.]me/post_document\n\n IPs\n104[.]248[.]148[.]156\n139[.]59[.]31[.]188\n\n HTTPS certificate\n74b5e317527c93539dbaaf84d6a61da92a56012a\n\n Hashes\n523cbdaf31ddc920e5b6c873f3ab42fb791fb4c9d1f4d9e6a7f174105d4f72a1\nab541df861c6045a17006969dac074a7d300c0a8edd0a5815c8b871b62ecdda7\n145daf50aefb7beec32556fd011e10c9eaa71e356649edfce4404409c1e8fa30\n93810c5fd9a287d85c182d2ad13e7d30f99df76e55bb40e5bc7a486d259810c8\n925f404b0207055f2a524d9825c48aa511199da95120ed7aafa52d3f7594b0c9\nfeca9ad5058bc8571d89c9d5a1eebce09e709cc82954f8dce1564e8cc6750a77\n06a4246be400ad0347e71b3c4ecd607edda59fbf873791d3772ce001f580c1d3\n77ef350639b767ce0a748f94f723a6a88609c67be485b9d8ff8401729b8003d2\n\n### YARA\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule APT_APT40_Implant_June2020 {\n  meta:\n    version = \"1.0\"\n    author = \"Elastic Security\"\n    date_added = \"2020-06-19\"\n    description = \"APT40 second stage implant\"\n  strings:\n    $a = \"/list_direction\" fullword wide\n    $b = \"/post_document\" fullword wide\n    $c = \"/postlogin\" fullword wide\n    $d = \"Download Read Path Failed %s\" fullword ascii\n    $e = \"Open Pipe Failed %s\" fullword ascii\n    $f = \"Open Remote File %s Failed For: %s\" fullword ascii\n    $g = \"Download Read Path Failed %s\" fullword ascii\n    $h = \"\\\\cmd.exe\" fullword wide\n  condition:\n    all of them\n}\n\n### References\n\n```\n\n-----",
