    "plain_text": "# Predatory Sparrow: Who are the hackers who say they started a fire in Iran?\n\n**bbc.com/news/technology-62072480**\n\nBy Joe Tidy\n\n**By Joe Tidy**\n\nCyber reporter\n\nPublished\n\n7 days ago\n\n\n-----\n\nImage source, Predatory Sparrow\nImage caption,\nThe steel factory shortly before the fire\n\n**It's extremely rare for hackers, who operate in the digital world, to cause damage in**\n**the physical world.**\n\nBut a cyber-attack on a steel maker in Iran two weeks ago is being seen as one of those\nsignificant and troubling moments.\n\nA hacking group called Predatory Sparrow said it was behind the attack, which it said caused\na serious fire, and released a video to back up its story.\n\nThe video appears to be CCTV footage of the incident, showing factory workers leaving part\nof the plant before a machine starts spewing molten steel and fire. The video ends with\npeople pouring water on the fire with hoses.\n\nIn another video that surfaced online, factory staff can be heard shouting for firefighters to be\ncalled and describing damage to equipment.\n\nPredatory Sparrow, also known by its Persian name, Gonjeshke Darande, says this was one\nof three attacks it carried out against Iranian steel makers on 27 June, in response to\nunspecified acts of \"aggression\" carried out by the Islamic Republic.\n\nMedia caption,\nThe moment when Predatory Sparrow says it caused the fire\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group has also started sharing gigabytes of data it claims to have stolen from the\ncompanies, including confidential emails.\n\nOn its Telegram page Predatory Sparrow posted: \"These companies are subject to\ninternational sanctions and continue their operations despite the restrictions. These cyberattacks, being carried out carefully to protect innocent individuals.\"\n\nThat last sentence has pricked the ears of the cyber-security world.\n\nClearly the hackers knew that they were potentially putting lives in danger, but it seems they\nwere at pains to ensure the factory floor was empty before they launched their attack - and\nthey were equally eager to make sure everyone knew how careful they had been.\n\nThis has led many to wonder whether Predatory Sparrow is a professional and tightly\nregulated team of state-sponsored military hackers, who may even be obliged to carry out\nrisk assessments before they launch an operation.\n\n[Iran says foreign country hacked petrol stations](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-59062907)\n[Iranian hackers posed as British-based academic](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57817463)\n\n\"They claim themselves to be a group of hacktivists, but given their sophistication, and their\nhigh impact, we believe that the group is either operated, or sponsored by, a nation state,\"\nsays Itay Cohen, head of cyber research at Check Point Software.\n\nImage source, Predatory Sparrow\n\nImage caption,\nPredatory Sparrow has a Telegram channel, Twitter account and even a logo\n\nIran has been the victim of a spate of recent cyber-attacks that have had an impact in the\nreal world but nothing as serious as this.\n\n\"If this does turn out to be a state sponsored cyber-attack causing physical - or in the war\nstudies jargon 'kinetic' damage - this could be hugely significant,\" says Emily Taylor, Editor of\nthe Cyber Policy Journal.\n\n\"Historically the Stuxnet attack on Iran's uranium enrichment facilities in 2010, has been\nhighlighted as one of the few - if not the only known - example of a cyber-attack causing\nphysical damage.\"\n\nStuxnet was a computer virus first discovered in 2010 that damaged or destroyed centrifuges\nat Iran's uranium enrichment facility in Natanz, hampering its nuclear programme.\n\nSince then there have been very few confirmed cases of physical damage.\n\nImage source, EPA\n\n\n-----\n\nImage caption,\nNatanz is heavily protected, with its most sensitive machinery housed deep underground\n\nPossibly the only one came in 2014 in Germany. In the annual report of the German cyber\nauthority it was stated that a cyber-attack caused \"massive damage\" to a steel factory,\ncausing an emergency shutdown, but no further details have ever been given.\n\nThere have been other cyber-attacks that could have caused serious damage but didn't\n[succeed. For example, hackers have tried but failed to add chemicals to the water supply by](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55989843)\ntaking control of water treatment facilities.\n\nIt's more common for cyber-attacks to cause disruption - to transport networks for example without causing real physical damage.\n\nEmily Taylor says it's a significant distinction because if a state is proven to have caused\nphysical damage to the Iranian steel factory it may have violated international laws\nprohibiting the use of force, and provided Iran with legal grounds to hit back.\n\nSo if Predatory Sparrow is a state-sponsored military hacking group, which country does it\nrepresent? Its name, a play on the name of the Iranian cyber-warfare group, Charming\nKitten, could be a clue, suggesting that it's a country with a strong interest in Iran.\n\nThe Stuxnet attack is widely thought to have been carried out by Israel, with support from the\nUS. And this time the murmurings linking the Predatory Sparrow attack with Israel have been\nloud enough to prompt a response from the Israeli government.\n\nAccording to Israeli media reports, Defence Minister Benny Gantz has ordered an\ninvestigation into leaks that led to Israeli journalists heavily hinting that Israel is behind the\nhack.\n\nThe minister is reportedly concerned that Israel's \"ambiguity policy\" on its operations against\nIran might have been broken.\n\n\"If this cyber-attack is state-sponsored then of course Israel is the prime suspect. Iran and\nIsrael are in a cyber-war, and officially both states acknowledge this,\" says Ersin Cahmutoglu\nfrom ADEO Cyber Security Services in Ankara.\n\n\"Both states mutually organise cyber-attacks through their intelligence services and\neverything has escalated since 2020 when retaliation came from Israel after Iran launched a\nfailed cyber-attack on Israeli water infrastructure systems and attempted to interfere with the\nchlorine level.\"\n\nImage caption,\nPredatory Sparrow hijacked road signs to spread chaos in Iran\n\n\n-----\n\nIn October last year Predatory Sparrow claimed responsibility for taking Iran s national fuel\nstation payment system offline. The group also said it had been behind a hack that hijacked\ndigital billboards on roads, making them display a message saying, \"Khamenei, where is our\nfuel?\" - a reference to the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nAgain, the hackers showed a degree of responsibility by warning Iran's emergency services\nin advance about the potential chaos that could result.\n\nCheck Point researchers say they have also found code in the malicious software used by\nPredatory Sparrow that matches code used by another group, called Indra, that hacked\nIranian train station displays in July last year.\n\nAccording to Iranian news reports, hackers indicated on information boards at stations\nacross the country that trains were cancelled or delayed, and urged passengers to call the\nsupreme leader.\n\nBut experts say the steel factory attack is a sign that the stakes are getting higher.\n\nImage source, FARS\n\nImage caption,\nIn August 2021 train station displays were hacked causing confusion to rail users\n\nAccording to the CEO of Mobarakeh Steel Company, where the fire apparently took place,\nthe plant's operations were not affected by the attack and no-one was hurt. The two other\ncompanies targeted also said they experienced no problems.\n\nNariman Gharib, a UK-based opposition Iranian activist and independent cyber-espionage\ninvestigator, is convinced the video is genuine. He notes that two other videos of the fire\nwere also posted on Twitter.\n\n\"The attack was real, as workers recorded video from another angle and we saw a statement\nposted on one company's Telegram channel regarding the suspension of the production line,\nwhich was later denied.\"\n\nHe fears a threshold has now been crossed.\n\n\"If Israel is behind these attacks, I think they are showing that they can do real damage\nrather than just disrupting a service. It shows how things can quickly escalate.\"\n\n## More on this story\n\nHow cyber-attacks could be deadly\n\n25 September 2020\n\n\n-----",
