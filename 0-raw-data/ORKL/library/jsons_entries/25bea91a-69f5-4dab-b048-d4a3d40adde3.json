This vulnerability was patched in October 2020](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5135)\nbut it is still \"heavily abused by ransomware groups today\" per Coveware.\n\n## Ransomware vs. SonicWall devices\n\n\n-----\n\nA threat group tracked by Mandiant as UNC2447 has also exploited the CVE-202120016 zero-day bug in SonicWall SMA 100 Series VPN appliances to deploy a new\nransomware strain known as FiveHands (a DeathRansom variant just as HelloKitty).\n\nTheir attacks targeted multiple North American and European targets before SonicWall\n[released patches in late February 2021.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-firewall-maker-hacked-using-zero-day-in-its-vpn-device/)\n\nThe same zero-day was also abused in January in attacks targeting SonicWall's internal\n[systems and later indiscriminately exploited in the wild.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-sma-100-zero-day-exploit-actively-used-in-the-wild/)\n\n[Mandiant threat analysts discovered three other zero-day vulnerabilities in SonicWall's on-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-warns-customers-to-patch-3-zero-days-exploited-in-the-wild/)\npremises and hosted Email Security (ES) products in March.\n\nThese three zero-days were also actively exploited by a group Mandiant tracks as UNC2682\nto backdoor systems using BEHINDER web shells, allowing them to move laterally through\nvictims' networks and access emails and files.\n\n\"The adversary leveraged these vulnerabilities, with intimate knowledge of the SonicWall\napplication, to install a backdoor, access files and emails, and move laterally into the victim\n[organization's network,\" the Mandiant researchers said at the time.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/04/zero-day-exploits-in-sonicwall-email-security-lead-to-compromise.html)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[QNAP alerts NAS customers of new DeadBolt ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qnap-alerts-nas-customers-of-new-deadbolt-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[SonicWall ‘strongly urges’ admins to patch SSLVPN SMA1000 bugs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-strongly-urges-admins-to-patch-sslvpn-sma1000-bugs/)\n\n[QNAP warns of ransomware targeting Internet-exposed NAS devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qnap-warns-of-ransomware-targeting-internet-exposed-nas-devices/)\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Intuit warns of QuickBooks phishing threatening to suspend accounts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/intuit-warns-of-quickbooks-phishing-threatening-to-suspend-accounts/)\n\n\n-----",
