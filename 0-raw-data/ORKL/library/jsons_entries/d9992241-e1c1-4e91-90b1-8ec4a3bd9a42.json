The\n\nRedLine Stealer is an infostealer malware marketed\n\ninfostealer is offered as malware-as-a-service with a subscription\n\nand sold on several online criminal forums by the\n\nof varying lengths available.\n\nRussian-speaking cybercriminal “REDGlade”, also known\nas “Glade”. RedLine Stealer is used to steal credentials Online discussions, reporting, and activities involving RedLine\nand other information such as cryptocurrency wallet Stealer increased in March 2021 and have since been relatively\nfiles that are easily monetized by direct use or sale to constant. This increase is also a reflection of reporting and\nother criminals. The sale of this stolen data is often sharing of information about RedLine Stealer as it has become\nconducted through underground markets that provide more broadly recognized as a threat by the security community.\none-stop shopping for criminals involved in identity theft\n\nRedLine Stealer collects usernames, passwords, cookies,\n\nor who simply wish to cash out what they can based on\n\nsaved credentials, and credit card information from browsers.

The phishing email lures](https://securityboulevard.com/2021/06/digital-artists-targeted-in-redline-infostealer-campaign/)\n[are often topical, concerning current events such as COVID-19](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/07/threat-thursday-redline-infostealer)\ninformation. RedLine Stealer has also been found disguised as\nlegitimate applications, including as an [installer for Telegram,](https://blog.minerva-labs.com/redline-stealer-masquerades-as-telegram-installer)\nand has been installed via SmokeLoader masquerading as\n[privacy software. Legitimate websites may be used as part of the](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/malware-masquerades-privacy-tool)\ninfection chain for RedLine Stealer distribution. As a commodity\nmalware that has been available since early 2020, and for which\na cracked version has been released, the malware is used by\ndisparate operators; thus, initial RedLine Stealer installation\nvectors may include many different methods and techniques.\n\n\n#### Threat Analysis\n\nRedLine Stealer is one of the most notorious infostealer\nbrands being sold on the dark web for the last year and a half.\nThe stealer is associated with several threat actors primarily\noperating on low-tier Russian-speaking forums and Telegram\nchannels.\n\nRedLine Stealer was first advertised on February 18, 2020,\non the low-tier Best Hack Forum (BHF) by the threat actor\nREDGlade. Similar advertisements were observed several days\nlater on other Russian-language low-tier forums WWH Club by\nthe threat actor Glade. All advertisements listed the Telegram\nchannel @REDLINESUPPORT as a primary point of contact for\nthe interested parties, a contact which is still active at the time\nof this publication. REDGlade also originally registered on Best\nHack Forum on February 13, 2020, and has a positive reputation\namong other cybercriminals on the forum. Analysis of the content\npublished by REDGlade indicates that they are primarily involved\nin the sales and support of RedLine Stealer. REDGlade was also\nactive on other Russian-speaking dark web forums posting\nabout RedLine Stealer. The threat actor Glade registered on\nWWH Club forum on February 13, 2020, the same date REDGlade\nregistered on BHF. Considering identical product listings, dates\nof registration, and the Telegram handle @REDLINESUPPORT,\nInsikt Group believes that the usernames REDGlade and Glade\nare very likely operated by the same individual or threat actor\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: List of sources with RedLine Stealer advertisements (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\nExamination of dark web discussions indicates that the\nprimary sources supporting the sale of RedLine Stealer are BHF\nand WWH Club forums. The seller encourages threat actors to use\npersonal messages and forum escrow for conducting purchases\nand provides a 20% discount for all types of goods and services\nthat meet the requirements. Open-source references toward\nthe Telegram handle @REDLINESUPPORT indicate that it was\nallegedly registered in Denmark.\n\nAccording to the threat actor, RedLine Stealer is an infostealer\nwith an admin panel developed in C# and steals login data from\nmultiple sources, including:\n\n[• All Chromium and Mozilla Gecko-based web browsers](https://www.chromium.org/)\n\n - Cookies\n\n  - Account credentials\n\n  - Payment card data\n\n  - Autofill forms\n\n  - FTP and Instant messenger client data\n\n\nRedLine Stealer is advertised as having the following\ntechnical functionality:\n\n  - A customizable file-grabber\n\n  - Filters for country and operating system (capable of\n\nsetting up a blocklist of countries where the build will not\nwork)\n\n  - Create and edit tasks\n\n  - Panel configuration that enables actors to remove\n\nduplicate logs\n\n  - Collect information about the victim’s system based\n\non the following indicators. Information can be viewed\ndirectly from the panel without opening the log:\n\n     - IP address\n\n    - Country\n\n    - City\n\n    - Current username\n\n    - HWID\n\n    - Keyboard layouts\n\n    - Screenshot\n\n     - Screen resolution\n\n    - Operating system\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: RedLine Stealer sales thread on the dark web (Source: BHF Forum)_\n\n    - UAC settings\n\n     - Types of privileges\n\n    - User-Agent\n\n     - Information about the components of the infected\n\nmachine (video cards and processors)\n\n     - Installed antiviruses\n\nInitial advertisements for RedLine Stealer detailed several\nsecondary tasks or functions it supports, such as:\n\n  - RunPE — injection of a 32-bit file downloaded from a\n\ndirect link into another user-specified file\n\n  - DownloadAndEx — download a file via a direct link to the\n\nspecified path from subsequent launch\n\n  - OpenLink — open the link in the default browser\n\n  - Downloading files via a direct link to a specified path\n\n##### “Cracked” Versions of RedLine Stealer\n\nThreat actors continue to distribute “cracked” versions of\nRedLine Stealer in 2021. The distribution of cracked versions of\n[RedLine Stealer is not a new phenomenon and has been reported](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/new-redline-stealer-distributed-using-coronavirus-themed-email-campaign)\nas far back as 2020. While the validity of these cracked versions\nof the stealer from over a year ago is less certain, actors in\n2021 attempting to gain access to the malware are more likely to\nrely on recent iterations of RedLine Stealer that were reportedly\nleaked across multiple sources within the past two months.\n\n\n\n- On August 26, 2021, the threat actor “alfy1331”\n\npublicly shared on XSS Forum a cracked version of\nRedLine Stealer v. 20.2. According to the threat actor,\nthe infostealer was cracked by another threat actor\nwith the Telegram account @kurome_sup. A search\nfor this Telegram handle on dark web sources found\nthe threat actor “Kurome”, a member of the low-tier\nRussian-speaking forum, who uses it as a primary point\nof contact. This upload likely had a cascading effect\nas other forums, including Best Hack Forum, where\nREDGlade initially operated, had members sharing\ncracked versions of RedLine Stealer with the same\nversion as the sample uploaded to XSS Forum: Version\n20.2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: alfy1331 shared cracked version of RedLine Stealer v.20.2 builder (Source: XSS Forum)_\n\nAs of this writing, the latest version of RedLine Stealer,\nversion 21.2, was released on September 3, 2021. alfy1331\nstated that the admin panel of the malware was updated and\nold RedLine Stealer builds would not work in the updated admin\npanel.\n\n\nAccording to REDGLade, there are 2 types of subscription\nlicenses for the latest malware variants:\n\n  - “PRO”, a lifetime license available for $800 with 3 months\n\nof free crypt service and antivirus scan check\n\n  - “Lite”, a 1-month license with 1 month of free crypt\n\nservice available for $150\n\nREDGLade previously provided discounts to buyers, and\nthe subscription costs have varied since the product’s launch\nin February 2020. RedLine Stealer is advertised as accepting\npayments in the following cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Litecoin,\nEthereum, Monero, and Tether. Additionally, RedLine Stealer’s\nTelegram support channel has continued to provide updates\nregarding new features available to Lite and PRO users\nthroughout 2021. In February 2021, the channel stated that\nfuture builds would be signed by default with Code Signing\ndigital certificates.\n\nSince its initial appearance, RedLine Stealer has continued\nto be adopted by top-tier cybercriminals. A thread launched\non June 27, 2021, on the top-tier Russian-speaking forum\nExploit called “Raccoon VS Redline VS Smoke” detailed how\ncybercriminals discussed the positives and negatives of various\ninfostealers that currently operate on the dark web market.\nParticipants stated that RedLine Stealer has good technical\nfunctionality and provides compromised credentials and other\nrelevant data as stated in the specs. Also, they stated that one\nof the primary advantages of RedLine Stealer is its crypt service,\n“Spectrum Crypt Service” @spectrcrypt_bot. For example, the\nthreat actor “_pra9ma” added that its functionality is similar to\nthat of AZORult stealer.\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven its positive feedback among cybercriminals, the\nsource code of RedLine Stealer is sought after by many threat\nactors, who are ready to pay a price significantly higher than its\nlifetime license cost. On September 17, 2021, the threat actor\n“Yorkshire” on Exploit Forum was going to buy RedLine Stealer’s\nsource code for $2,000.\n\n##### Role of RedL ine Stealer in Underground Shops\n\nAnalysis of the dark web shops involved in the sales of\nthe stolen account credentials indicates that RedLine Stealer\ncontinues to supply several prominent underground shops,\nincluding Russian Market and Amigos Market, with the largest\nnumber of compromised accounts as of this writing in comparison\nto 4 to 5 other stealers often leveraged by its administrators.\nTypically, the prices for RedLine Stealer-compromised accounts\nare higher than other infostealers. Recently compromised\naccounts by RedLine Stealer cost $10.\n\n_Figure 6: RedLine Stealer listings for sale on the dark web (Source: Russian Market)_\n\n\n-----\n\n|Stealer|Russian Market Listings|Amigos Market Listings|\n|---|---|---|\n|RedLine|761,985|765,217|\n|Vidar|645,078|645,078|\n|Taurus|95,417|95,417|\n|Racoon|85,951|87,720|\n|AZORult|48,663|48,663|\n|Ficker|Does not supply credentials|1,561|\n||||\n\n\n_Table 1: Compromised account listings by infostealer brand on Amigos Market and Russian Market_\n_(Source: Recorded Future Data)_\n\nDespite the volume of RedLine Stealer infections appearing\nacross Russian Market and Amigos Market listings, both Amigos\nMarket and Russian Market were identified by Insikt Group (June\n2021) posting identical listings regularly that contained the same\ntimestamps, infostealer variants used, geographical locations of\naffected machines, and ISPs. This also means that the figures in\nTable 1, above, tabulating the true number of listings across the\n2 shops is inflated by nearly double, as there are a large number\nof listings on both shops which are identical.\n\nKELA Group shared research with Insikt Group to further\ncorroborate the relationship between the 2 shops. Their research\nhighlights unique identifiers, viewable by inspecting the HTML\npage content, that are identical between Russian Market and\nAmigos Market. Bot data being advertised on Amigos Market that\nhas been scraped from Russian Market uses the identifier that\nwas assigned to this data set on Russian Market and prepends\nit with the letter “v”. In some instances, the same stolen data is\nre-listed on Amigos Market for a 50% markup over its price on\nRussian Market. KELA’s analysis shows that of the 1.5 million bots\nbeing advertised on Amigos Market, the number of identifiers\nthat do not have the prepended “v” designation is a small fraction\nof what is being advertised overall, suggesting a large portion\nof Amigos Market is almost entirely a mirror of Russian Market.\n\n#### Technical Analysis\n\nInsikt Group analyzed the 3 main RedLine Stealer components:\nthe legitimate admin panel, which contains an integrated builder\nthat requires purchasing the software to use, the cracked version,\nwhich allows free access to the admin panel but does not allow\nbuilds to be created from within the panel, and a cracked builder\nthat generates RedLine Stealer builds outside of the admin panel\nwithout needing to pay for the software.\n\n\n##### RedLine Stealer Admin Panel Analysis\n\nOn August 26th, 2021, alfy1331 shared a cracked version\nof the admin panel used to build RedLine Stealer and explore\ndata stolen from infected machines on XSS Forum, giving other\nthreat actors free access to RedLine Stealer. The cracked version\nshared on XSS is version 20.2; as of this writing the official\nRedLine Stealer is up to version 21.2. Insikt Group acquired this\ncracked version for in-depth analysis.\n\nThere are only 4 steps involved to configure the cracked\nversion. These steps can be completed in under 10 minutes by an\nexperienced threat actor. This includes running 2 executables as\nan administrative user, logging in to the panel using the supplied\nusername (“ims0rry”) and password (“racoon”), and filling out\na few fields in a panel that generates a functioning build of\nRedLine Stealer. The cracked distribution also contains an FAQ,\na 12-page PDF included when RedLine Stealer is purchased\nfrom the original developer. The FAQ has detailed installation,\nbuilding, crypting, and general configuration and customization\ninstructions, making RedLine Stealer more accessible and easy\nto use for any threat actor on the dark web.\n\nBefore generating a build for RedLine Stealer, threat actors\ncan customize the build settings using the panel seen in Figure\n7 below. Threat actors can choose to collect data from browsers,\nVPN clients, Steam, Telegram, and more. They can also specify\nwhich files they want to retrieve, including the use of wildcard\nfiltering, and also which domains to filter for, including sensitive\npasswords and cookies.\n\nThe cracked version of RedLine Stealer also includes a\nstandalone builder configured with the default parameters seen\nabove. Threat actors can use the cracked standalone builder\n(Kurome.Builder) to specify their server IP address, port, build\nID, and error message, as seen in Figure 8 below. Insikt Group\ndeveloped a script to extract the configuration information from\nan executable that was built using the cracked builder. The script\nand extracted configuration details are available to Recorded\nFuture clients.\n\nInsikt Group used the cracked builder to create a malware\nsample that exfiltrated the collected data to an admin panel\nrunning in our lab. This gave us access to the data exfiltrated\nfrom the infostealer and allowed us to interact with the data\nusing the admin panel. The panel view labeled “Logs” contains a\nlist of machines infected with RedLine Stealer that have finished\nexfiltrating stolen data. This can be seen below in Figure 9,\nalong with the options available to the threat actor to explore\nthe stolen data.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: RedLine Stealer build settings panel (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: RedLine Stealer panel showing exfiltrated logs from infected machine (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\nOne of the menu options, “System Info”, gives the threat\nactor a detailed view into the infected machine, such as the\ninstalled operating system, hardware details, a screenshot,\ninstalled antivirus, the country code, IP address, and other useful\ninformation, which can be seen in Figure 10 below.\n\nThreat actors can access specific logs to gain information\nto support further operations. An example, seen below in Figure\n11, shows the detailed view giving the threat actor access to\nthe cookies stolen from the infected machine. Theft of cookies\ncan lead to session hijacking and session spoofing, which can\nallow an attacker to impersonate the infected user and access\nwebsites they frequent.\n\nInformation exfiltrated from an infected machine can be\nsaved locally to be accessed outside of the dedicated admin\npanel. Additional information outside of what is displayed in the\npanel can be found in the saved logs, including a list of installed\nsoftware, a process list, and more detailed user information.\n\nThreat actors that manage multiple deployments of RedLine\nStealer can use the “Statistics” tab in the panel to get an overview\nof the data they’ve successfully stolen. The statistics include\nthe number of wallets, passwords, credit cards, and cookies, as\nwell as statistics about the top 10 operating systems, antivirus\nsystems, and countries where they’ve deployed RedLine Stealer.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: System information and screenshot exfiltrated from an infected machine to RedLine Stealer admin panel (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n_Figure 11: Cookies exfiltrated from an infected machine to RedLine Stealer panel (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12: Saving a “log” from an infected machine results in these files being saved to the specified folder (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n_Figure 13: RedLine Stealer panel showing statistics about infected machines that communicate with this command and control server(Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n##### RedLine Stealer Analysis\n\nThe RediIne Stealer is written in C#, and based on Insikt\nGroup’s analysis, the code appears to be written by an experienced\nC# developer. The malware has a modular design with classes\ndedicated to each task or module, seen below in Figure 14. This\nallows new components to be written and integrated with minimal\noverhead. The icon file associated with the executable can vary\nfrom build to build as it can be specified by the threat actor\nusing the RedLine Stealer admin panel. Builds created using the\ncracked builder have an original filename “Implosions.exe”, the\nassembly name “Happy.exe”, and are 96 KB; however, this can\nchange depending on the layers of obfuscation applied by each\nthreat actor after building RedLine Stealer. The threat actor who\n\n\ndeveloped RedLine Stealer included recommendations in the FAQ\non crypting services available via Telegram that can be used\nwith RedLine Stealer, one of which is the @spectrcrypt_bot. The\nrecommended services are:\n\n  - Using the /defensenet command in @spectrcrypt_bot,\n\nwhich is operated by the threat actor\n\n  - Using the /defense command in @spectrcrypt_bot, and\n\nthe executable will be crypted on crypter[.]biz\n\n  - @Floiar\n\n  - @ninjacrypterbot\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14: Modules included in RedLine Stealer version 20.2 (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n_Figure 15: Example of the ProtonVPNRule class highlighting developer tendencies (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15 highlights the following trends used by the\ndeveloper throughout the RedLine Stealer code:\n\n1. The code obfuscates path strings and uses string\n\nreplacement functions to determine the real file path,\nhelping the malware evade static string detection.\n\n2. It uses arrays for strings instead of string variables and\n\nstores strings in reverse order to avoid string detection.\n\n3. Continuous misspellings of words can be found within\n\nthe code.\n\nThe bulk of the collection can be seen in the module labeled\n“ResultFactory”, specifically in the function called directly\nfrom the application’s Program.Execute main function named\n“sl9HSDF234”. Interestingly, the names of the functions in\nResultFactory are obfuscated, while all other function names in\nthe binary are unobfuscated.\n\nRedLine Stealer will terminate its own process and delete\nitself from disk in an attempt to remain undetected after\ncollecting and exfiltrating the stolen data.\n\nSince the release of the cracked builder, the original developer\nhas continued to add functionality to RedLine Stealer. Some\n[researchers report the addition of more types of crypto wallets](https://twitter.com/0x4143/status/1435203497033670660)\nbeing collected from newer samples including TerraStation,\nHarmonyWallet, Coin98Wallet, TonCrystal, and KardiaChain.\n\n##### Host-Based Detection\n\n\nRedLine Stealer samples execute various commands that\ncan be keyed on for detection. Although the PID and the path\nof the executable will change depending on the environment\nthis instance of RedLine Stealer is running in, these commands\nand subsequent actions can be used for detection. We have\ncreated a Sigma rule to detect the use of commands and this\nrule has been shared on the Recorded Future Platform.\n\nInsikt Group has also created a YARA rule for RedLine\nStealer. The YARA rule is based upon uncommon strings\nfound in the code as well as the misspellings described in the\nRedLine Stealer Analysis section. The YARA rule is available to\nRecorded Future clients.\n\n##### Network-Based Detection\n\nNetwork detection logic can be developed by making use\nof several key elements in the communications between the\nRedLine Stealer implant and the command and control (C2)\nserver:\n\n  - RedLine Stealer communicates using the Microsoft\n\nSimple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), which allows\napplications to transfer data over HTTP. Tempuri[.]org\nis the default domain used by Microsoft development\nproducts including SOAP, and this and other SOAP\nartifacts are observed in the RedLine Stealer C2 traffic.\n\n  - Specific communications from the server are visible in\n\nthe traffic, including commands from the C2 to gather\ninformation. There are some uncommon strings used.\n\n  - Specific communications from the infected system are\n\nvisible in the traffic, such as system enumeration and\nresponses to commands. Some uncommon strings are\nused.\n\n\n_Figure 16: ResultFactory class showing the list of collected data (left) and a detailed view of the scanned wallets (right) (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17: RedLine Stealer-infected communication displaying SOAP interaction and C2 server instructions (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\nRedLine Stealer C2 servers use TCP, but do not use any\nspecific port. As mentioned in the technical analysis section\nabove, the port can be set within the RedLine Stealer builder.\nRedLine Stealer C2 servers most often are observed using\n[random, high port numbers such as 11915 or 31858. Benign SOAP](https://threatfox.abuse.ch/ioc/229360/)\n[traffic is often on port 80, however, RedLine Stealer C2 servers](https://techterms.com/definition/soap)\n[have been observed operating on port 80 as well.](https://threatfox.abuse.ch/ioc/229044/)\n\nNot all of these elements are specific to RedLine Stealer,\nand in fact those such as the use of SOAP or port 80/TCP are\nquite common in network traffic. But by combining some of\nthese features, effective detections may be developed. Based\non this data, Snort IDS rules were created using aspects of the\npreceding elements these are available on the Recorded Future\nPlatform.\n\n##### Active C2 Server Detection\n\nInsikt Group detects active RedLine Stealer C2 servers based\non configuration data extracted from RedLine Stealer samples,\nwhich are then validated by checking for the appropriate\nresponse from the server. C2 servers so identified can be found\nin the Recorded Future Platform.\n\nThere are also open-source resources available for\norganizations to keep informed of RedLine Stealer C2 servers\nobserved in the wild, such as the ThreatFox compilation of\n[RedLine Stealer C2 servers provided by Abuse.ch.](https://threatfox.abuse.ch/browse/malware/win.redline_stealer/)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Outlook\n\nRedLine Stealer has become increasingly popular since\nits launch in 2020 based on a general increase in reference\ncount observed among underground sources monitored by\nInsikt Group. This increase has been furthered by the influx of\ncracked versions of RedLine Stealer distributed across Englishlanguage cybercriminal forums, such as Raid Forums, that are\neasily accessible even to actors with less experience with similar\ntooling. RedLine Stealer’s [role as a secondary payload that](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/malware-masquerades-privacy-tool)\nsupplements threat activity tied to other popular underground\ntooling, such as SmokeLoader, raises the probability that this\nstealer will continue to be a reliable method of data harvesting for\nthe near future. The demand for stolen login information derived\nfrom RedLine Stealer infections for sale within the criminal\nunderground similarly ensures that shops and marketplaces will\ncontinue to rely on it as a primary source of stolen information to\nsell. This continues to be reflected on multiple popular infostealer\nshops, such as Russian Market, where RedLine Stealer infections\nare associated with the highest volume of infected machines\nwhen compared to other popular infostealers including Vidar and\nAZORult.\n\nSeveral links to cracked versions of RedLine Stealer\ndistributed within underground sources are no longer active, with\nREDGlade likely to have taken steps to prevent old builds of the\ninfostealer from working with the new admin panel. However,\nthreat actors who have already downloaded the older, cracked\nRedLine Stealer package, which includes a builder and control\npanel, can continue using and sharing the malware without any\ncost.\n\nDespite the release of a cracked version of the RedLine\nStealer, REDGlade has continued to develop the malware and\nnow sells a new, updated version. It is expected that both the\n“legitimate” and cracked versions of the malware will remain\npopular due to the free or minimal cost of this effective infostealer.\nWe expect that the criminal marketplaces currently selling data\ncollected by RedLine Stealer will continue doing so as long as the\nmalware remains an effective means of accomplishing this task.\n\nSince REDGlade continues to update RedLine Stealer with\nnew functionality and continues to add new features to the\nadmin panel, detections will need to be verified and updated\naccordingly in the future.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Recorded Future\n\nRecorded Future is the world’s largest provider of intelligence for enterprise\n\nsecurity.
