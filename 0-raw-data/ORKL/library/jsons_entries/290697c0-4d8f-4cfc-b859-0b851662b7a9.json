Since then, except for a one-off, suspected comeback in November 2018,\nwith a phishing campaign targeting several US-based organizations, no activity has been\nconfidently attributed to the Dukes. This left us thinking that the group had stopped its\nactivities.\n\nThis held true until recent months, when we uncovered three new malware families that we\nattribute to the Dukes – PolyglotDuke, RegDuke and FatDuke. These new implants were\nused until very recently, with the latest observed sample being deployed in June 2019. This\nmeans the Dukes have been quite active since 2016, developing new implants and\ncompromising high-value targets. We call these newly uncovered Dukes activities,\ncollectively, Operation Ghost.\n\n[Operation Ghost: The Dukes aren’t back – they never left](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ESET_Operation_Ghost_Dukes.pdf)\n\n[Download Research Paper](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ESET_Operation_Ghost_Dukes.pdf)\n\n## Timeline and victimology\n\nWe believe Operation Ghost started in 2013 and it is still ongoing as of this writing. Our\nresearch shows that the Ministries of Foreign Affairs in at least three different countries in\nEurope are affected by this campaign. We have also discovered an infiltration by the Dukes\nat the Washington, DC embassy of a European Union country.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the first public traces of this campaign is to be found on Reddit in July 2014. Figure\n1 shows a message posted by the attackers. The strange string using an unusual character\nset is the encoded URL of a C&C server used by PolyglotDuke.\n\n_Figure 1. Reddit post containing an encoded Command & Control URL_\n\nFigure 2 presents the timeline of Operation Ghost. As it is based on ESET telemetry, it\nmight be only a partial view of a broader campaign.\n\n_Figure 2. Timeline of Operation Ghost_\n\n## Attribution to the Dukes\n\nOn one hand, we noticed numerous similarities in the tactics of this campaign to those from\npreviously documented ones, such as the use of:\n\nsteganography in images to hide payloads or C&C communications\nWindows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for persistence\n\nWe also noticed important similarities in the targeting:\n\n\n-----\n\nall the known targets are Ministries of Foreign Affairs.\nknown targeted organizations were previously compromised by other Dukes malware\nsuch as CozyDuke, OnionDuke or MiniDuke.\non some machines compromised with PolyglotDuke and MiniDuke, we noticed that\nCozyDuke was installed only a few months before.\n\nHowever, an attribution based only on the presence of known Dukes tools on the same\nmachines should be taken with a grain of salt. We also found two other APT threat actors –\n[Turla and](https://recon.cx/2018/brussels/resources/slides/RECON-BRX-2018-Visiting-The-Snake-Nest.pdf) [Sednit – on some of the same computers.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/eset-sednit-full.pdf)\n\nOn the other hand, we found strong code similarities between already documented samples\nand samples from Operation Ghost. We cannot discount the possibility of a false flag\noperation, however, this campaign started while only a small portion of the Dukes’ arsenal\nwas known. In 2013, at the first known compilation date of PolyglotDuke, only MiniDuke had\nbeen documented and threat analysts were not yet aware of the importance of this threat\nactor. Thus, we believe Operation Ghost was run simultaneously with the other campaigns\nand has flown under the radar until now.\n\nPolyglotDuke (SHA-1: D09C4E7B641F8CB7CC86190FD9A778C6955FEA28) uses a\ncustom encryption algorithm to decrypt the strings used by the malware. We found\nfunctionally equivalent code in an OnionDuke sample (SHA-1:\nA75995F94854DEA8799650A2F4A97980B71199D2) that was documented by F-Secure in\n2014. It is interesting to note that the value used to seed the srand function is the\ncompilation timestamp of the executable. For instance, 0x5289f207 corresponds to Mon 18\nNov 2013 10:55:03 UTC.\n\nThe IDA screenshots in Figure 3 show the two similar functions.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Comparison of a custom string encryption function found in PolyglotDuke (on the left) and_\n\n_in OnionDuke (on the right) samples from 2013_\n\nFurther, recent samples of the MiniDuke backdoor bear similarities with samples\ndocumented more than five years ago. Figure 4 is the comparison of a function in a\n[MiniDuke backdoor listed by Kaspersky in 2014 (SHA-](https://securelist.com/miniduke-is-back-nemesis-gemina-and-the-botgen-studio/64107/)\n1: 86EC70C27E5346700714DBAE2F10E168A08210E4) and a MiniDuke backdoor (SHA1: B05CABA461000C6EBD8B237F318577E9BCCD6047) compiled in August 2018.\n\n_Figure 4. Comparison of the same function in MiniDuke from 2014 (on the top) and in MiniDuke_\n\n_from 2018 (on the bottom)_\n\nGiven the numerous similarities between other known Dukes campaigns and Operation\n_Ghost, especially the strong code similarities, and the overlap in time with previous_\ncampaigns, we assess with high confidence that this operation is run by the Dukes.\n\n## Updated tools and techniques\n\nIn Operation Ghost, the Dukes have used a limited number of tools, but they have relied on\nnumerous interesting tactics to avoid detection.\n\n\n-----\n\nFirst, they are very persistent. They steal credentials and use them systematically to move\nlaterally on the network. We have seen them using administrative credentials to\ncompromise or re-compromise machines on the same local network. Thus, when\nresponding to a Dukes compromise, it is important to make sure to remove every implant in\na short period of time. Otherwise, the attackers will use any remaining implant to\ncompromise the cleaned systems again.\n\nSecond, they have a sophisticated malware platform divided into four stages:\n\nPolyglotDuke, which uses Twitter or other websites such as Reddit and Imgur to get\nits C&C URL. It also relies on steganography in images for its C&C communication.\nRegDuke, a recovery first stage, which uses Dropbox as its C&C server. The main\npayload is encrypted on disk and the encryption key is stored in the Windows registry.\nIt also relies on steganography as above.\nMiniDuke backdoor, the second stage. This simple backdoor is written in assembly. It\nis very similar to older MiniDuke backdoors.\nFatDuke, the third stage. This sophisticated backdoor implements a lot of\nfunctionalities and has a very flexible configuration. Its code is also well obfuscated\n[using many opaque predicates. They re-compile it and modify the obfuscation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_predicate)\nfrequently to bypass security product detections.\n\nFigure 5 is a summary of the malware platform of Operation Ghost.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Summary of Operation Ghost malware platform_\n\nThird, we also noticed that the operators avoid using the same C&C network infrastructure\nbetween different victim organizations. This kind of compartmentalization is generally only\nseen by the most meticulous attackers. It prevents the entire operation from being burned\nwhen a single victim discovers the infestation and shares the related network IoCs with the\nsecurity community.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur new research shows that even if an espionage group disappears from public reports for\nmany years, it may not have stopped spying. The Dukes were able to fly under the radar for\nmany years while compromising high‑value targets, as before.\n\nA comprehensive list of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and samples can be found in the\n[full white paper and on GitHub.](https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/dukes)\n\nFor a detailed analysis of the backdoor, refer to our [white paper.
