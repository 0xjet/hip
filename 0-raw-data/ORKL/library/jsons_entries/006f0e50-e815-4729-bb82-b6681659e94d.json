The campaign involved a backdoor Trojan that the attackers distributed\nvia dozens of apps in Google Play and elsewhere.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Dr Web first reported the malware in July 2019, but we decided to investigate because the](https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=13349&c=0&p=0)\nTrojan was more sophisticated than most malware for stealing money or displaying ads. The\nspyware is able to gather geo-location data, call logs and contacts; and can monitor SMS\nactivity. The malware can also collect information about the device and the apps installed on\nit.\n\nThe earliest registered PhantomLance domain we found dates back to December 2015. We\nfound dozens of related samples that had been appearing in the wild since 2016 and one of\nthe latest samples was published in November last year. We informed Google about the\nmalware, and Google removed it soon after. We observed around 300 attacks targeting\nspecific Android devices, mainly in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring our investigation, we discovered various overlaps with reported OceanLotus APT\ncampaigns, including code similarities with a previous Android campaign, as well as macOS\nbackdoors, infrastructure overlaps with Windows backdoors and a few cross-platform\ncharacteristics.\n\n### Naikon’s Aria\n\nThe Naikon APT is a well-established threat actor in the APAC region. Kaspersky first\n[reported and then fully described the group in 2015. Even when the group shut down much](https://securelist.com/the-chronicles-of-the-hellsing-apt-the-empire-strikes-back/69567/)\nof its successful offensive activity, Naikon maintained several splinter campaigns.\n\n[Researchers at Check Point recently published their write-up on Naikon resources and](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/naikon-apt-cyber-espionage-reloaded/)\nactivities related to “Aria-Body”, which we detected in 2017 and reported in 2018. To\nsupplement their research findings, we published a summary of our June 2018 report,\n[“Naikon’s New AR Backdoor Deployment to Southeast Asia“, which aligns with the Check](https://securelist.com/holy-water-ongoing-targeted-water-holing-attack-in-asia/96311/)\nPoint report.\n\nAR is a set of backdoors with compilation dates between January 2017 and February 2018.\nMuch of this code operates in memory, injected by other loader components without touching\ndisk, making it very difficult to detect. We trace portions of this codebase back to\n“xsFunction” EXE and DLL modules used in Naikon operations going back to 2012. It’s\nprobably that the new backdoor, and related activity, is an extension of, or a merger with, the\ngroup’s “Paradir Operation”. In the past, the group targeted communications and sensitive\ninformation from executive and legislative offices, law enforcement, government\n\n\n-----\n\nadministrative, military and intelligence organizations within Southeast Asia. In many cases\nwe have seen that these systems also were targeted previously with PlugX and other\nmalware.\n\nThe group has evolved since 2015, although it continues to focus on the same targets. We\nidentified at least a half a dozen individual variants from 2017 and 2018.\n\n[You can read our report here.](https://securelist.com/naikons-aria/96899/)\n\n### COMpfun authors spoof visa application with HTTP status-based Trojan\n\nLast October, we observed malware that we call Reductor, with strong code similarities to\nCOMpfun, which [infected files on the fly to compromise TLS traffic. The attackers behind](https://securelist.com/compfun-successor-reductor/93633/)\nReductor have continued to develop their code. More recently, the Kaspersky Threat\nAttribution Engine revealed a new Trojan with strong code similarities to COMpfun.\n\nThe [new malware, like its predecessor, targeted diplomatic bodies in Europe. To lure their](https://securelist.com/compfun-http-status-based-trojan/96874/)\nvictims, the attackers used spoofed visa applications that contain malware that acts as a\nfirst-stage dropper. This in turn downloads the main payload, which logs the target’s location,\ngathers host- and network-related data, performs keylogging and takes screenshots. The\nTrojan also monitors USB devices and can infect them in order to spread further, and\nreceives commands from the C2 server in the form of HTTP status codes.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt s not entirely clear which threat actor is behind COMpfun. However, based mostly on the\nvictims targeted by the malware, we associate it, with medium-to-low confidence, with the\nTurla APT.\n\n### Mind the [air] gap\n\nIn June, we published our report on the latest tools and TTPs (Tactics Techniques and\nProcedures) of [Cycldek (aka Goblin Panda, APT 27 and Conimes), a threat actor that has](https://securelist.com/cycldek-bridging-the-air-gap/97157/)\ntargeted governments in Southeast Asia since 2013.\n\nMost of the attacks we have seen since 2018 start with phishing emails that contain\npolitically themed, booby-trapped RTF documents that exploit known vulnerabilities. Once\nthe target computer has been compromised, the attackers install malware called NewCore\nRAT. There are two variants. The first, BlueCore, appears to have been deployed against\ndiplomatic and government targets in Vietnam; while the second, RedCore, was first\ndeployed in Vietnam before being found in Laos.\n\nBot variants download additional tools, including a custom backdoor, a tool for stealing\ncookies and a tool that steals passwords from Chromium-based browser databases. The\nmost striking of these tools is USBCulprit, which relies on USB media to exfiltrate data from\nvictims’ computers. This may suggest that Cycldek is trying to reach air-gapped networks in\ncompromised environments or relies on a physical presence for the same purpose. The\nmalware is implanted as a side-loaded DLL of legitimate, signed applications.\n\n### Looking at big threats using code similarity\n\n\n-----\n\n[In June, we announced the release of KTAE (Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine). KTAE](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/cyber-attack-attribution-tool)\nwas initially developed as an internal threat hunting tool by the Global Research and\n[Analysis Team at Kaspersky and was instrumental in our investigations into the LightSpy,](https://securelist.com/ios-exploit-chain-deploys-lightspy-malware/96407/)\n[TajMahal,](https://securelist.com/project-tajmahal/90240/) [Dtrack,](https://securelist.com/my-name-is-dtrack/93338/) [ShadowHammer and](https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/) [ShadowPad campaigns.](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/)\n\nHere’s how it works in a nutshell. We extract from a suspicious file something that we call\n‘genotypes’ – short fragments of code selected using our proprietary algorithm – and\ncompare it with more than 60,000 objects of targeted attacks from our database, using a\nwide range of characteristics. Based on the code similarities, KTAE calculates a reputational\nscore and highlights the possible origin and author, with a short description and links to both\nprivate and public resources, outlining the previous campaigns.\n\n[Subscribers to our APT intelligence reports can see a dedicated report on the TTPs used by](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/apt-intelligence-reporting?redef=1&THRU&reseller=gl_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder_______)\nthe identified threat actor, as well as further response steps.\n\nKTAE is designed to be deployed on a customer’s network, with updates provided via USB,\nto ensure confidentiality. In addition to the threat intelligence available ‘out of the box’,\ncustomers can create their own database and fill it with malware samples found by in-house\nanalysts. In this way, KTAE will learn to attribute malware analogous to those in the\ncustomer’s database while keeping this information confidential. There’s also an API\n(application programming interface) to connect the engine to other systems, including a thirdparty SOC (security operations center).\n\nCode similarity can only provide pointers; and attackers can set false flags that can trick\neven the most advanced threat hunting tools – the ‘attribution hell’ surrounding Olympic\nDestroyer provided an object lesson in how this can happen. The purpose of tools such as\n\n\n-----\n\nKTAE is to point experts in the right direction and to test likely scenarios.\n\nYou can find out more about the development of KTAE in this [post by Costin Raiu, Director of](https://securelist.com/big-threats-using-code-similarity-part-1/97239/)\nthe Global Research and Analysis Team and this [product demonstration.](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/15591/414427?utm_source=kdaily&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=gl_great-kitchen_ay0073&utm_content=link&utm_term=gl_kdaily_organic_73kst6nfgfeyywq)\n\n### SixLittleMonkeys\n\nEarlier this year, we observed a Trojan injected into the spooler system process memory of a\ncomputer belonging to a diplomatic body. The malware is implemented like an API using an\nenterprise-grade programming style – something that is quite rare and is mostly used by\nadvanced threat actors. We attribute this campaign to a threat actor called SixLittleMonkeys\n(aka Microcin) because of the re-use of C2 infrastructure, code similarities and focus on\ndiplomatic targets in Central Asia.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThis threat actor uses steganography to deliver malicious modules and configuration data\nfrom a legitimate public resource, in this case from the legitimate public image hosting\nservice cloudinary.com:\n\n[You can read our full report here.](https://securelist.com/microcin-is-here/97353/)\n\n## Other malware\n\n### Loncom packer: from backdoors to Cobalt Strike\n\nIn March, we reported the distribution of Mokes and Buerak malware under the guise of a\nsecurity certificate update. Following publication of that report, we conducted a detailed\nanalysis of the malware associated with this campaign. All of the malware uses legitimate\nNSIS software for packing and loading shellcode, and the Microsoft Crypto API for\ndecrypting the final payload.\n\nBesides Mokes and Buerak, which we mentioned in the previous article, we noticed packed\nspecimens of DarkVNC and Sodin (aka REvil and Sodinokibi). The former is a backdoor\nused to control an infected machine via the VNC protocol; the latter is a ransomware family.\nHowever, the most striking find was the Cobalt Strike utility, which is used both by legal pentesters and by various APT groups. The command center of the sample that contained\nCobalt Strike had previously been seen distributing CactusTorch, a utility for running\nshellcode present in Cobalt Strike modules, and the same Cobalt Strike packed with a\ndifferent packer.\n\n### xHelper: the Trojan matryoshka\n\n\n-----\n\nThe [xHelper Trojan remains as active as ever. The most notable feature of this Trojan is its](https://securelist.com/unkillable-xhelper-and-a-trojan-matryoshka/96487/)\npersistence on an Android device: once it gets onto a phone, it’s able to survive even if it’s\ndeleted or the device is restored to factory settings.\n\nThe architecture of the latest version resembles a Russian nesting doll (or ‘matryoshka’). The\ninfection starts by tricking a victim into downloading a fake app – in the case of the version\nwe analyzed, an app that masquerades as a popular cleaner and speed-up utility. Following\ninstallation, it is listed as an installed app in the system settings, but otherwise disappears\nfrom the victim’s view – there’s no icon and it doesn’t show up in search results. The\npayload, which is decrypted in the background, fingerprints the victim’s phone and sends the\ndata to a remote server. It then unpacks a dropper-within-a-dropper-within-a-dropper (hence\nthe matryoshka analogy). The malicious files are stored sequentially in the app’s data folder,\nto which other programs do not have access. This mechanism allows the malware authors to\nobscure the trail and use malicious modules that are known to security solutions.\n\nThe final downloader in the sequence, called Leech, is responsible for installing the Triada\nTrojan, whose chief feature is a set of exploits for obtaining root privileges on the victim’s\ndevice. This allows the Trojan to install malicious files directly in the system partition.\nNormally this is mounted at system startup and is read-only. However, once the Trojan has\nobtained root access, it remounts the system partition in write mode and modifies the system\nsuch that the user is unable to remove the malicious files, even after a factory reset.\n\nSimply deleting xHelper isn’t enough to clean the device. If you have ‘recovery’ mode set up\non the device, you can try to extract the ‘libc.so’ file from the original firmware and replace\nthe infected one with it, before removing all malware from the system partition. However, it’s\nsimpler and more reliable to completely re-flash the phone. If the firmware of the device\ncontains pre-installed malware capable of downloading and installing programs, even reflashing will be pointless. In that case, it’s worth considering an alternative firmware for the\ndevice.\n\n### Spike in RDP brute-force attacks\n\nThe huge increase in remote working due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had a direct\nimpact on cybersecurity and the threat landscape. Alongside the higher volume of corporate\ntraffic, the use of third-party services for data exchange and employees working on home\ncomputers (, IT security teams also have to grapple with the increased use of remote access\ntools, including the Microsoft RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).\n\nRDP, used to connect remotely to someone else’s desktop, is used by telecommuters and IT\nsupport staff to troubleshoot problems. A successful RDP attack provides a cybercriminal\nwith remote access to the target computer with the same permissions enjoyed by the person\nwhose computer it is.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the two months prior to our report (i.e. March and April), we observed a huge increase in\nattempts to brute-force passwords for RDP accounts. The numbers rose from 100,000 to\n150,000 per day in January and February to nearly a million per day at the beginning of\nMarch.\n\n1\n\n_Growth in the number of attacks by the Bruteforce.Generic.RDP family, February–April 2019_\n_[(download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2020/04/29113731/rdp-stats-all.png)_\n\nSince attacks on remote infrastructure will undoubtedly continue, it’s important for anyone\nusing RDP to protect their systems. This includes the following.\n\nUse strong passwords.\nMake RDP available only through a corporate VPN.\nUse [NLA (Network Level Authentication).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Level_Authentication)\nEnable two-factor authentication.\nIf you don’t use RDP, disable it and close port 3389.\nUse a reliable security solution.\n\nEven if you use a different remote access protocol, you shouldn’t relax. At the end of last\n[year, Kaspersky experts found 37 vulnerabilities in various clients that connected via the](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/vnc-vulnerabilities/31462/)\nVNC protocol, which, like RDP, is used for remote access.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Gaming during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nOnline gamers face various threats, including malware in pirated copies, mods and cheats,\n[phishing and other scams when buying or exchanging in-game items and dangers](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/steam-scam/11317/)\n[associated with buying accounts.](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/whats-wrong-with-cheap-game-keys/35682/)\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to a marked increase in player activity.

With the connection of work computers to\nhome networks, and, conversely, the entry of home devices into work networks that are often\npoorly prepared for this, attacks on players are becoming not only a way to get to an\nindividual user’s wallet but also a way to access the corporate infrastructure. Cybercriminals\nare actively hunting for vulnerabilities that they can exploit to compromise systems.

The infected file, which has an EXE](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/bootkit/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\nor RAR extension, is called (in Russian) ‘on the new initiative of the World Bank in\nconnection with the coronavirus pandemic’. The file is a self-extracting archive that contains\n‘easymule.exe’ and ‘1211.doc’.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe file includes the Rovnix bootkit.\n\nRovnix is well-known and the source code published some time ago. And there’s nothing\nnew about cybercriminals exploiting the current pandemic to distribute malware. However,\n[Rovnix has been updated with a UAC (User Account Control) bypass tool, allowing the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control)\nmalware to escalate its privileges without displaying a UAC request. It also uses DLL\nhijacking to camouflage itself in the system.\n\nThis version also delivers a loader that is unusual for this malware. Once the malware is\ninstalled, the C2 can send commands to control the infected computer, including recording\nsound from the microphone and sending the audio file to the cybercriminals, turning off or\nrestarting the computer.\n\nOur analysis of this version makes it clear that even well-known threats like Rovnix can throw\nup surprises when the source code goes public. Freed from the need to develop their own\nprotection-bypassing tools from scratch, cybercriminals can pay more attention to the\ncapabilities of their own malware and add their own ‘goodies’ to the source code – in this\ncase, UAC bypass.\n\n[You can read our full analysis here.](https://securelist.com/oh-what-a-boot-iful-mornin/97365/)\n\n### Web skimming with Google Analytics\n\nWeb skimming is a common method of stealing the data of online shoppers. Cybercriminals\ninject malicious code into a target website to harvest the data entered by consumers. They\ngain access to the compromised site by brute-forcing an administrator account password,\nexploiting vulnerabilities in the CMS (content management system) or one of its third-party\nplugins, or by injecting malicious code into an incorrectly coded input form.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne way to prevent this is to try to block the exfiltration of the harvested data using a\nContent Security Policy (CSP) – a technical header that lists all services with the right to\ncollect information on a particular site or page. If the service used by the cybercriminals is\nnot listed in the header, they will not be able to withdraw any information they harvest.\n\nSome attackers are using Google Analytics to work around this. Most online providers today\ncarefully monitor visitor statistics; and the most convenient tool for doing this is Google\nAnalytics. The service, which allows data collection based on many parameters, is currently\nused by around 29 million sites. So, there’s a strong likelihood that data transfer to Google\nAnalytics is allowed in the CSP header of an online store. To collect website statistics, all you\nhave to do is configure tracking parameters and add a tracking code to your pages. As far as\nthe service is concerned, if you are able to add this code, you are the legitimate owner of the\nsite. So, the malicious script injected by the attacker can collect user data and then, using\ntheir own tracking code, send it through the Google Analytics Measurement Protocol directly\nto their account.\n\nTo prevent these issues, webmasters should do the following:\n\nAdopt a strict CMS access policy that restricts user rights to a minimum.\nInstall CMS components from trusted sources only.\nCreate strong passwords for all administrator accounts.\nApply updates to all software.\nFilter user-entered data and query parameters, to prevent third-party code injection.\nFor e-commerce sites, use PCI DSS-compliant payment gateways.\n\nConsumers should use a reliable security solution – one that detects malicious scripts on\npayment sites.\n\n[You can read more about this method here.](https://securelist.com/web-skimming-with-google-analytics/97414/)\n\n### The Magnitude Exploit Kit\n\nExploit kits are not as widespread as they used to be. In the past, they sought to exploit\nvulnerabilities that had already been patched. However, newer and more secure web\nbrowsers with automatic updates simply prevent this. The decline in the use of Adobe Flash\nPlayer has also reduced the opportunities for cybercriminals. Adobe Flash Player is a\nbrowser plug-in: so even if the browser was up-to-date, there was a possibility that Adobe\nFlash was still vulnerable to known exploits. The end of life date for Adobe Flash is fast\napproaching. It is disabled by default in all web browsers and has pretty much been replaced\nwith open standards such as HTML5, WebGL, and WebAssembly.\n\nNevertheless, exploit kits have not disappeared completely. They have adapted and\nswitched to target people running Internet Explorer that haven’t installed the latest security\nupdates.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough Edge replaced Internet Explorer as the default web browser with the release of\nWindows 10, Internet Explorer is still installed for backward compatibility on machines\nrunning Windows 10; and has remained the default web browser for Windows 7, 8 and 8.1.\nThe switch to Microsoft Edge development also meant that Internet Explorer would no longer\nbe actively developed and would only receive vulnerability patches without general security\nimprovements. Notwithstanding this, Internet Explorer remains a relatively popular web\n[browser. According to NetMarketShare, as of April 2020, Internet Explorer is used on 5.45%](https://meterpreter.org/netmarketshare-april-data-windows-os-decrease-edge-was-firmly-in-second-place/)\nof desktop computers (for comparison, Firefox accounts for 7.25%, Safari 3.94% and Edge\n7.76%).\n\nDespite the security of Internet Explorer being five years behind that of its modern\n[counterparts, it supports a number of legacy script engines. CVE-2018-8174 is a vulnerability](https://securelist.com/delving-deep-into-vbscript-analysis-of-cve-2018-8174-exploitation/86333/)\nin a legacy VBScript engine that was originally discovered in the wild as an exploited zeroday. The majority of exploit kits quickly adopted it as their primary exploit. Since its discovery,\na few more vulnerabilities for Internet Explorer have been discovered as in-the-wild zerodays – CVE-2018-8653, CVE-2019-1367, CVE-2019-1429 and CVE-2020-0674. All of them\n[exploited another legacy component of Internet Explorer – a JScript engine. It felt like it was](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/12/apacolypse-now-exploiting-windows-10-in_18.html)\njust a matter of time until exploit kits adopted these new exploits.\n\nExploit kits still play a role in today’s threat landscape and continue to evolve. We recently\nanalyzed the evolution of one of the most sophisticated exploit kits out there – the Magnitude\nExploit Kit – for a whole year. We discovered that this exploit kit continues to deliver\nransomware to Asia Pacific (APAC) countries via malvertising. Study of the exploit kit’s\nactivity over a period of 12 months showed that the Magnitude Exploit Kit is actively\nmaintained and undergoes continuous development. In February this year, the exploit kit\nswitched to an exploit for the most recent vulnerability in Internet Explorer – CVE-2019-1367\n– originally discovered as an exploited zero-day in the wild. Magnitude Exploit Kit also uses a\npreviously unknown elevation of privilege exploit for CVE-2018-8641, developed by a prolific\nexploit writer.\n\n[You can read more about our findings here.](https://securelist.com/magnitude-exploit-kit-evolution/97436/)\n\nWhile the total volume of attacks performed using exploit kits has decreased, it’s clear that\nthey still exist, remain active, and continue to pose a threat. Magnitude is not the only active\nexploit kit and we see other exploit kits that are also switching to newer exploits for Internet\nExplorer. We recommend that people install security updates, migrate to a supported\noperating system (and make sure you stay up-to-date with Windows 10 builds) and also\nreplace Internet Explorer as their web browser.\n\n[Backdoor](https://securelist.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[Exploit Kits](https://securelist.com/tag/exploit-kits/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Phishing](https://securelist.com/tag/phishing/)\n[RDP](https://securelist.com/tag/rdp/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Trojan](https://securelist.com/tag/trojan/)\n\nAuthors\n\n[David Emm](https://securelist.com/author/davidemm/)\n\nIT threat evolution Q2 2020\n\nYour email address will not be published.
