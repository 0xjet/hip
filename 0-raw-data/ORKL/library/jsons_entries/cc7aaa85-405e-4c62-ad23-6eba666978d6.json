This is of importance because the FIN7\ngroup has been historically believed to operate out of Russia.\n\n## Political pressure mounting on ransomware gangs\n\nFIN7’s recent announcement also comes after the operators and members of multiple\nransomware operations have been hunted and arrested all over the world this summer.\n\nFor example, in their previous incarnation as the Darkside ransomware, the FIN7 group had\nto pull the plug on their operation after their servers were hacked and cryptocurrency funds\nwere stolen, following a suspected law enforcement action.\n\nIn addition, rival ransomware gang REvil shut down not once, but twice, with the second time\nin October, after law enforcement backdoored and hijacked their dark web servers.\n\n[Furthermore, just last week, Europol detained a Ukrainian group who orchestrated more than](https://therecord.media/europol-detains-suspects-behind-lockergoga-megacortex-and-dharma-ransomware-attacks/)\n1,800 ransomware attacks with strains such as LockerGoga, MegaCortex, and Dharma,\nincluding the devastating attack on aluminum producer Norsk Hydro in early 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis period of intense pressure on ransomware gangs comes after attacks have reached an\nall-time high this year, with some attacks causing major issues across the world. Examples\nhere include the Darkside ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline (caused fuel supply\nissues for the US East Coast), the REvil attack on JBS Foods (disrupted meat supply across\nthe US), and the REvil attack on Kaseya (disrupted thousands of companies across the\nglobe).\n\nAs Jeff Moss, founder of the Black Hat and DEF CON security conferences, said earlier\ntoday on Twitter, law enforcement agencies have typically known the identities of most\nransomware operators but have also known they couldn’t go after some groups because of\nRussia’s uncooperative behavior, something that appears to be changing – based on\nBlackMatter’s statement.\n\nSuggests the authorities have known all along and only once the pressure increased\ndid they act. It’s examples like that that convinced me that ransomware is at least 50%\n[a political problem. https://t.co/1Yi6KxriMD](https://t.co/1Yi6KxriMD)\n\n[— Jeff Moss (@thedarktangent) November 3, 2021](https://twitter.com/thedarktangent/status/1455790624452399105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nTags\n\n[BlackMatter](https://therecord.media/tag/blackmatter/)\n[Darkside](https://therecord.media/tag/darkside/)\n[RaaS](https://therecord.media/tag/raas/)\n[Ransomware](https://therecord.media/tag/ransomware/)\n[Russia](https://therecord.media/tag/russia/)\n[shutdown](https://therecord.media/tag/shutdown/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
