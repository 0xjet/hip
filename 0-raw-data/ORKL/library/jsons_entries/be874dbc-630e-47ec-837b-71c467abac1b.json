    "plain_text": "-----\n\nAs is shown in the SS7 network\nanalysis performed by Positive\nTechnologies in 2014[*], even hackers\nwith a minimal knowledge of how\nto launch security attacks against a\ntelecom company can:\n\n­­ Disclose a subscriber location\n\n­­ Wiretap phone calls\n\n­­ Intercept SMS messages and\npasswords\n\n­­ Steal money from subscriber\naccounts\n\n­­ Affect availability of service\n\nThe research also discovered that:\n\n­­ Even the top 10 telecom\noperators are vulnerable to these\nattacks\n\n­­ Hacker location and network\ntype are of no significance\n\n­­ Hackers only need a Linux-based\nPC\n\n­­ Required software is available on\nthe Internet\n\n­­ Attacks involve valid SS7\nmessages: rough filtration can\nnegatively affect your entire\nservice\n\n\n### Cellular Network Security Complications\n\nOur society is more reliant than ever on telecommunications. There are at least 4bn subscribers worldwide and 70% of firms rely on the SS7 network for Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) solutions for the provision of their own services. Everything from ATMs\nto GPS navigation devices already transmits data over cellular networks.\n\nBut there is a significant weakness at the heart of this mobile revolution: the widely-used SS7\nsignaling protocols were developed decades ago with no protection provided or even planned.\nThough recently introduced, SIGTRAN specifications for SS7 protocols inherited all the weak\npoints of SS7.\n\nMobile communications further evolved to provide mobile carriers and service providers with\nwider access to SS7 networks. Overall roaming connectivity adds to the pressure on mobile\ncarriers to ensure network security and continuity of service. This lack of security enables hackers\nto send, intercept, and alter SS7 messages attacking cellular networks and subscribers.\n\nRecently, SS7 security has become very topical:\n\n­­ When Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the CIA, first talked about the total surveillance by the NSA, many infosec experts showed evidence that the main technique the NSA\ncould have used was exploitation of SS7 vulnerabilities.\n\n­­ There are private companies offering SS7 attack services at reasonable rates, and as more companies enter the market, the rates continue to fall.\n\n­­ Celebrities’ private conversations posted on the Internet by hackers have become more frequent.\n\n­­ Current SS7 filtering systems (firewalls) are weak as they fail to analyze signaling traffic flows in\ndetail without causing a loss of speed and connectivity.\n\n- www.ptsecurity.com/library/whitepapers/\n\n\n-----\n\n### PT SS7 Attack Discovery[™]: Detecting Mobile Attacks\n\nPT SS7 Attack Discovery[™] — a new telecom security solution from Positive Technologies — detects\nintrusions via an SS7 network online and immediately informs infosec departments for early incident response. The system also performs a retrospective analysis of signaling traffic and assists in\nforensics tasks while not interfering with SS7/SIGTRAN interaction. Key features:\n\n­­ **Detection of all SS7 attack vectors including: examination of the network and collection**\nof subscriber data (IMSI, MSC/VLR, HLR), user location tracking, interception of SMS messages,\nsending of spoofed SMS and USSD messages, subscriber or cellular segment DoS, billing bypass, alteration of subscriber profiles in VLR and subscriber categories.\n\n­­ **Low impact on signaling traffic. The PT SS7 AD[™] system is implemented at the border of**\nthe SS7 network avoiding a negative effect on signaling traffic. Only an IP connection is required. There is no need to assign special addresses to SS7 in the form of Signaling Point Codes\n(SPC) or Global Titles (GT). Quick attack identification and its thorough analysis enhances protection avoiding impact on the speed of the network and its services.\n\n­­ **Message correlation. This is available in systems with load balancing over several Signal**\nTransfer Points (STPs), ensuring the whole SS7 perimeter is covered and preventing false positives.\n\n­­ **Regularly updated knowledge base. PT SS7 AD[™] benefits from the expertise of the spe-**\ncialist Positive Technologies Telecoms Research Lab, ensuring it reflects the very latest research\non SS7 security.\n\n­­ **Dynamic analysis. This approach rapidly determines which SS7 network activity is irregular**\nby monitoring traffic changes and comparing its characteristics at different times.\n\n­­ **Data visualization. User-friendly dashboards display information about all interactions with**\nexternal SS7 networks; attacks and fraud attempts. These dashboards are configurable for ease\nof data analysis.\n\n\n###### Additional Features\n\nPT SS7 Attack Discovery[™] is used to\ncreate a single SS7 stream database\nin a carrier’s network. In addition to\ndetecting attacks, its in-depth analysis of signaling traffic and call flows\nenables carriers to:\n\n­­ Investigate fraud\n\n­­ Gather evidence of malicious\nactivity\n\n­­ Detect equipment errors\n\n­­ Find bottlenecks in the carrier’s\ninfrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\n### Attack Vectors: How to Detect and Prevent\n\n**Example №1:** **Network investigation and collection of subscriber data (IMSI, MSC/VLR,**\nHLR). A hacker examines an operator’s network (1), finds core hosts, determines their functional\nroles (2, 3), and collects information that the network discloses (4).\n\nSubsequent BEGIN messages\nto the GT pool from\n7900100900 to 7900100920\n\n**SS7** **1** **2**\n\nAttacker **4** **STP** **MSC/VLR** **HLR**\n\n**ABORT message from** GT 7900100904 GT 7900100905\n7900100904\n7900100905 **3**\n\nMeanwhile, PT SS7 AD[™] logs his actions identifying illegal use of such messages as SRI4SM, SRI,\nSRI4LCS, SendIMSI, etc. Recognizing attacks while they are being planned helps to prevent their\nexecution.\n\n**Example №2: Disclosure of subscriber location and control over his moves.** With necessary data on the network and its subscribers gathered, the hacker directly addresses the main\nhosts (1, 2) requesting information about the subscriber via ATI, PSI, and SRI messages (3).\n\nSubscriber IMSI\n\n#### 1\n\n 2\n\n**SS7**\n\nMCC, MNC,\nLAC, CID\n\nAttacker **STP** **MSC/VLR** **MCC: 250**\n\n**MNC: 90**\n**LAC: 4A67**\n**CID: 673D**\n#### 3\n\nUsing signature analysis, PT SS7 Attack Discovery[™] singles out illegal messages from the traffic and\nregisters an attack attempt. Rapid response to the attack can block and prevent the hacker from\nmonitoring subscriber moves.\n\n**Example №3: Interception of SMS messages is one of the most perilous attacks because it**\nexploits SMS messages that often include sensitive information such as payment confirmation (3D\nSecure codes) and recovery data for email, social network, and payment service passwords. The\nattacker only needs to register a victim subscriber on a fake MSC/VLR (1, 2). If successful, the hacker\nwill receive all subscriber’s SMS messages (3–6).\n\nFake MSC/VLR\n\n**SS7** **1**\n\n**Fake MSC/VLR** Attacker **HLR** **MSC/VLR** Subscriber A\n\n\n-----\n\nSMS to\nSubscriber A\n\n**SS7** **4**\n\n**Fake MSC/VLR** Attacker **HLR** **5** **SMS Center**\n\nFake MSC/VLR\n\n##### 6\n\nSMS to Subscriber A\n\nAnalyzing subscriber registration outside the home network, PT SS7 AD[™] checks its integrity and\ndetects suspicious and unfinished procedures that prove attack attempts. With this attack detected,\nyou can be sure there was an attempt to compromise a subscriber and obtain his data. Therefore,\nprevention of such attacks and notification of clients of such attempts is a necessity.\n\n**Example №4: DoS for MSC. A hacker can directly attack an operator’s network and its services.**\nThe most severe are DoS attacks because they cause network unavailability and many other negative implications. The attack is based on the procedure of assigning a roaming number (MSRN)\nwhen receiving a voice call. If an attacker sends multiple roaming number requests (1), then the\npool of available numbers will soon be exhausted (2). As a result, the switch will not be able to\nprocess terminating calls (3).\n\nProvide\nRoaming Number\n\n#### 1\n\n 2\n\n**SS7** **3**\n\n|3|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n\nAttacker **STP** **MSC/VLR**\n\n\n**BUSY**\n\n\nSubscriber\n\n\nStudying valid call flow sequences, PT SS7 AD[™] detects attacks at the very beginning, identifies and\nhelps to block attack sources. Detection of other DoS attacks — exploitation of HLR Reset and SCCP\nManagement, denial of service via SSN Prohibit and TID Flood — has the same algorithm.\n\nPT SS7 Attack Discovery[™] can also discover redirection and wiretapping of voice calls, sending of\nfake SMS and USSD messages, subscriber DoS, spoofing of a subscriber’s profile in a VLR, alteration of a subscriber’s category, and many other attacks. For details, see the SIGNALING SYSTEM\n7 (SS7) SECURITY REPORT at http://www.ptsecurity.com/upload/ptcom/SS7_WP_A4.ENG.0036.01.\nDEC.28.2014.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n### PT SS7 Attack Discovery[™] in Use\n\n**Modularity**\n\nPT SS7 Attack Discovery[™] includes two types of modules. SS7 Sensor collects raw SS7 traffic from\nthe STP, singles out useful data, and sends messages to Attack Detector. Attack Detector aggregates processed SS7 traffic from all SS7 Sensors in the network, creates dialogs, discovers intrusions\nusing its knowledge base, and examines signaling traffic for unusual behavior.\n\n**Full view**\n\nPT SS7 Attack Discovery[™] obtains data from all required links, either international or local, and places\nit in separate dialogs on Attack Detector to avoid loss of system messages and false positives.\n\n**In-depth protocol analysis**\n\nPT SS7 AD[™] studies all-layer protocols and checks address information, address and subscriber ID\ncompliance, and operation codes. Based on the complete view of the signal exchange, the system\ncomes to a conclusion about the attack and immediately informs the infosec department about it.\n\n**Call flow inspection**\n\nWith a vast knowledge of mobile systems, PT SS7 AD[™] identifies suspicious messages from external\nnetworks, unusual message sequences, and wrong equipment responses to outside actions. The\nsystem renders all data on anomalies to information security staff for analysis.\n\n**Flexible classification of attacks**\n\nWith a custom event classification system, PT SS7 AD[™] signals an attack if a message comes from a\nblacklisted address. There is also the option to create white lists — a limited number of addresses\nwhose actions will be recognized as valid.\n\n### Deployment and Operation Modes\n\nPT SS7 Attack Discovery[™] is deployable both as hardware and as a virtual solution. Depending on\nthe client’s tasks and technical specifications, the system can run in a variety of modes:\n\n**1.** External traffic analysis on the STP. PT SS7 AD[™] receives all incoming and outgoing traffic on an\n“external” STP interface and detects attacks against telecom carriers.\n\n\n**Sensor**\n\n\n**Attack Detector**\n\n\n-----\n\n**2.** Traffic analysis after the border STP. To detect intrusions into a border device, PT SS7 AD[™] examines a copy of traffic from an internal SS7 network on any aggregating host.\n\n\nPT SS7 Attack Discovery[™] processes\nthe copy of signaling traffic and\nkeeps away from the SS7/SIGTRAN\ninteraction between operators\navoiding any damaging impact on\nthe network and its services speed.\n\n\n**Sensor**\n\n\n**Attack Detector**\n\n\n**3.** Traffic analysis before network elements. If PT SS7 AD[™] cannot obtain a traffic copy from an\naggregating host, it studies traffic before key network elements (MSC/VLR, HLR, SMSC).\n\n**STP**\n\n**SS7**\n\n**HLR** **MSC/VLR**\n\nTraffic Traffic\ncopy copy\n\n**Sensor** **Attack Detector**\n\n**4.** Analysis of specific message types. SIGTRAN must be connected to the STP. The STP must be\nable to copy traffic depending on specific features of signaling messages.\n\n\n**Sensor**\n\n\n**Attack Detector**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Additional Services: Telecom Security Analysis\n\nPT SS7 Attack Discovery[™] enhances detection of real-time intrusions via the SS7 network. Nonetheless, you can prevent many attacks beforehand discovering vulnerabilities and noncompliance\nwith security standards on all the levels of the telecommunications infrastructure. Positive Technologies provides telecom companies with:\n\n­­ **SS7 security audit service that includes MAP/CAP attack simulation, assessment of impact**\non CS Core (MSC/VLR/HLR/AuC), forensic investigation of possible fraud or SS7-based security\nincidents.\n\n­­ **Cell network security assessment** to examine various vulnerabilities and configuration\nweakness in the radio access network that could allow illegal use of services and disruption or\ndegradation of services delivered through 2G, 3G, and 4G.\n\n­­ **Mobile application security service to reduce the risk of security breaches that could**\ncause significant financial losses and damage to reputation. We provide both client- and server-side application analysis using gray- and white-box testing to identify vulnerabilities and\nfind ways to neutralize them.\n\n­­ **Penetration testing to detect hidden system flaws; evaluate the potential impact on opera-**\ntions if those flaws are exploited; verify the efficiency of current security tools and evaluate the\nlevel of security awareness among staff.\n\n­­ **Vulnerability research into new technologies, protocols, and applications to check**\nwhether security mechanisms are missing or employed incorrectly; to identify vulnerabilities\nand security issues that arise as a result and reduce associated risk.\n\n­­ **Security and compliance audit (ISO 27001, 27002, and 27011; TIA, ITU, NIST, ETSI recom-**\nmendations) as a basis for development of an adequate and comprehensive action plan for\ninformation security enhancements. Such plans help to mitigate the financial and reputational\nrisk related to information security.\n\n###### About Positive Technologies\n\nPositive Technologies is a leading provider of vulnerability assessment, compliance management, and threat\nanalysis solutions to more than 1,000 global enterprise clients.
