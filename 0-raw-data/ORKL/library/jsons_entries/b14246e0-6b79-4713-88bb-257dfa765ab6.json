The Go malware comes in 32-bit and 64-bit variants as both ELF and PE\nfiles, allowing the threat actor to develop the malware once and deploy it to many different\narchitectures.\n\n**SHA-256** 0322c4c2d511f73ab55bf3f43b1b0f152188d7146cc67ff497ad275d9dd1c20f\n\n**First seen** 2020-04-06 01:09:29\n\n**Go version** 1.8\n\nThe most recent samples of WellMess differ from the 2018 samples as they now support\ncommunicating with the C2 server via three separate communication methods. The sample\nanalysed in this report is typical of the latest generation of WellMess.\n\nThe malware builds a pipe-separated userParameters string based on the victim machine’s\ncomputer name, user domain, user name and several hardcoded values in the malware, and\nstores it for use throughout the malware’s execution. An example string would be:\n```\ncomputername|console|userdomain|username|NTSUUpIIaFEU|104\n\n```\nThe bold values are taken from data hardcoded in the binary and likely represent campaign\nor platform information about the running malware. In this sample a copy of the string then\nhas the NTSUUpIIaFEU string appended for a second time and then MD5 hashed which is\nstored for later use.\n\nAs mentioned, the malware can communicate with the C2 server via three communication\nmethods with each being enabled or disabled on a per sample basis.The three methods are:\n\nHTTP\nHTTPS\nDNS\n\nIn this sample the DNS communication method is not enabled; however, the method has\nbeen documented for completeness as the functionality is present in the malware.\n\nFor each communication method the malware follows a similar process; it establishes a\nconnection with the C2 and then enters an infinite loop to exchange data. The details of the\ninitial connection differ for each method but the main loop that exchanges data uses the\nsame functions to carry out malicious functionality.\n\n\n-----\n\n## HTTP communications\n\nThe HTTP mode is the same communication method used in variants of the malware from\n2018. Although it uses the non-encrypted HTTP protocol to communicate with the C2 it\nmanually encrypts the contents of the requests to hide data from packet inspection. The\nmalware creates an AES session key and initial value (as detailed in Appendix C) which are\nbase64 encoded, appended to each other with a \\n separator. Once appended, it is further\nencrypted with a hardcoded RSA public key and base64 encoded again and obfuscated\nbefore being sent to the C2 as the body of a POST request.\n\nFigure 1. Initial message format\n\nThe obfuscation routine used on the final base64 data removes and replaces characters in\nthe base64 string, according to Table 1:\n\nTable 1. Character replacements\n\n**Plain text symbol** **Obfuscated data**\n\n+,\n\n/ :\n\n= Three spaces\n\nThe string is then chopped into randomly chosen 3-8 character chunks and each chunk is\nseparated with a single space. The final string is then set as the content of a HTTP POST\nrequest to the hardcoded IP and port present in the malware. The POST request also\ncreates an obfuscated cookie to include in the POST request. The cookie is a string\nconsisting of tags that contain information about the malware which is then RC6 encrypted\nwith a hardcoded key, base64 encoded and split into random sized chunks. The first cookie\nsent to the C2 includes the previously generated MD5 session hash and has the following\nformat before encryption:\n```\nmd5_hash/pa:1_0p\n\n```\nEncrypted cookies generated by the malware can be decrypted with a script[3] provided by\nJPCERT, so long as the RC6 key has been obtained for the sample that generated the\ncookie.\n\nOnce the AES key and IV have been sent to the C2 the malware sends the userParameters\nstring and the saved MD5 hash separated by a newline character in the same way. The only\ndifference from the previous send is that the <;title;> tag contains the string a:1_1 this time.\n\nAfter the initial connection to the C2 has been established, the malware will repeatedly\nattempt to receive a command from the C2. The communications follow the pattern shown in\nFigure 2\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Communication pattern\n\nThe 2398 random bytes of data are base64 encoded and then obfuscated as detailed\npreviously in Table 1. This data is then sent to the C2 with an RC6 encrypted cookie with the\n<;head;> tag containing the MD5 session hash value, the <;title;> tag containing the string rc\nand the <;service;> tag being present but empty. The malware expects the server to respond\nwith a HTTP 200 OK response that contains an RC6 encrypted cookie in a similar format to\nthe sent cookie. This is checked in the malware by parsing the received cookie data\naccording to the following regex which also matches the format of the sent cookie data.\n```\n[^;]*?);>(?P[^\n\n```\nThe cookie is used by the malware to determine what type of command has been received\nfrom the C2; Table 2 summarises the possible options.\n\nTable 2. Cookie tag details\n\nTag Value Description\n\nhead G Send a beacon to the C2 to maintain the connection\n\nhead C Start downloading multiple chunks of data from the C2\n\ntitle integer The number of chunks to be downloaded from the C2 when in C mode\n\nservice p Calculate a new AES key and send it to the C2\n\nservice f Tells the malware the received data is to be decoded as base64 rather\nthan UTF8\n\nservice u Updates the user agent used in communications to be a string sent\nfrom the C2\n\nservice m Updates the maximum size of data to be sent in one POST request to\nthe C2\n\nservice hi Updates the wait time used by the G tag\n\nservice pr Changes the enabled protocol list\n\nservice fu Writes a file to the victim\n\nservice fd Sends a file from the victim to the C2\n\n\nservice No\nValue\n\n\nThe contents from the C2 are executed as either command line or\nPowerShell script commands\n\n\nIf the response from the C2 contains a value of p in the service tag received, then the\nmalware will generate a new AES key and send it to the C2 in the same way as during the\ninitial connection to the C2.\n\n\n-----\n\nA value of G in the head tag will make the malware send the string Missed me? Interval=\nwith the currently configured value that is used by the malware to calculate wait intervals\nwhen receiving this command.\n\nA value of C in the head tag will check a <;title;> tag for the number of chunks the C2 wants\nto send to the malware and will receive data and store it for later use until the title tag value\nin a received message matches the desired number of chunks from the C2. This method will\nbe used when the C2 wishes to send a large amount of data to the malware but does not\nwant to alert network monitoring tools that a large data transfer is occurring.\n\nThe service tag values, except for p, are used when interpreting the content of the data sent\nto the malware. The content of the data is stored in the Content segment of the 200 OK\nresponses from the C2. The data in the content section is converted from the obfuscated\nformat detailed in Table 1, base64 decoded and then decrypted using the AES key that was\npreviously sent to the C2.\n\nOnce all the data has been received and decoded from the C2, the malware will call a\nfunction called botlib.Work which is responsible for the malicious behaviour of this malware.\nThis function handles the u, m, hi, fu, fd and pr service tags as well as having a default case\nwhere the service tag does not contain any data. The fu commands take the contents of the\nresponse from the C2 as the file to write and parses the service tag for the file name and\npath to use. The service tag is expected to be in the following format:\n```\nfu|filepath|filename\n\n```\nThe tag is split using the ‘|’ character and if the filepath parameter is present, then the data\nis written to a file using that parameter as the file name and path. If the path is not present,\nthen the malware instead writes the file to the current directory the malware is in with a file\nname of upload.filename. The fd command uses the same format to find the file to send to\nthe C2; however, if the filepath parameter is not present the malware will look for a file in the\ncurrent folder called download.filename.\n\nThe pr command also utilises the ‘|’ as a separator with each protocol separated by the\nsymbol. An example service tag that would enable all of the communication methods in the\nsample analysed would be:\n```\npr|1|2|3\n\n```\nThe default case when the service tag is empty allows the malware to treat the contents of\nthe response from the C2 as a command to execute via the Go library functions\nos.exec.Command or os.exec.Start. The format of the received command is checked against\nthe below regex pattern for validity before executing and the command is read from the body\nof the message received from the C2.\n```\nfileName:(?P.*?)\\sargs:(?P.*?)\\snotwait:(?P.*)\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThis method for running commands is slightly different from the older .NET variants of the\nbackdoor which additionally supported running scripts via PowerShell.\n\n## HTTPS communications\n\nWhen the backdoor is configured to use HTTPS to communicate with the C2, the\nfunctionality is largely the same as when in HTTP mode. The differences are that it lacks the\noptions to update a session key due to encryption being handled by the TLS layer and it also\ndoes not have the option to send data to and from the C2 in the chunking mode previously\ndescribed. In addition, only one transmission is made to the C2 when the malware is\nestablishing a connection as there is no exchange of an AES session key. The hello\nmessage that is sent contains the same plaintext data as the HTTP mode.\n```\nComputername|console|userdomain|username|NTSUUpIIaFEU|104\\nMD5_hash_string\n\n```\nHowever, the title tag has just the character a rather than a:1_1 that is used for the HTTP\nbeacon.\n\nThe communication pattern between the victim and the C2 also follows the same pattern as\ndescribed in Figure 2 but the outer layers of obfuscating the data and RSA encryption are\nremoved due to the TLS protocol handling the encryption. The malware secures the\ncommunications between itself and the C2 by implementing a feature called mutual TLS.\n\nUsually TLS operates in simple mode, which only requires a server to carry out\nauthentication. Mutual TLS means the malware has a trusted SSL certificate hardcoded in its\nbinary that it uses to check the certificate provided by the C2; the malware also forwards its\nown hardcoded certificate to the C2 that the C2 checks. So long as both the C2 and the\nmalware accept the provided certificates then communications will be encrypted using TLS,\notherwise the connection will be rejected and the malware will not be able to communicate\nwith the C2.\n\nWhen looking at the certificates embedded in the samples, it appears that the threat actor\nuses a self-signed certificate authority to sign both the C2 and the malware’s certificates. The\nWellMess malware stores the C2 IP addresses it uses in the binary as a plaintext url. The\nformat of the C2 url string for the example in Figure 3 would be one of:\n\nhxxp[:]//45.152.84[.]57:port_number; or,\nhxxps[:]//45.152.84[.]57:port_number.\n\nThis pattern can be used to identify numerous samples of the WellMess backdoor.\n\n## DNS communications\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DNS communication protocol is significantly different to the previous two modes. Data is\nsent to the C2 by DNS tunnelling. This involves prepending encoded data as a sub domain\nto a threat actor-controlled domain and then using DNS requests to transmit this data to the\nC2 with other DNS resolution services forwarding on the message.\n\nThe implementation of DNS tunnelling in this sample uses A records to send data to the C2\nand then uses TXT records to receive commands during its main loop.The initial message\nsent to the C2 consists of the current time printed in DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS AM/PM\nformat. This is then encoded using a non-standard base32 encoding with an alphabet of\nybndrfg8ejkmcpqxot1uwisza345h769. This time value is then used throughout the execution\nof the malware as part of the DNS beacon message to the C2.\n\nThe DNS method builds a URL string by splitting the encoded string into four parts of random\nlength, separating each with a period. It then gzips and RC4 encrypts the previously\ngenerated MD5 hash string using a hardcoded key. As this sample did not have DNS\nfunctionality enabled, the key was not configured in this binary. The result of the RC4\noperation is then encoded using the base32 encoding and then that is split into a periodseparated string with each chunk a random length.\n\nIf the result of the manipulation of the MD5 hash gave the string abcdefg12345, the resulting\nperiod separated string could end up being something like .ab.cde.fg12.245. Each chunk can\nhave a maximum length of 12 characters.\n\nThe previously encoded four-part message then has the command of this operation\nappended to it, in the initial beacon’s case the command is id. That then has the MD5 string\nappended to it followed by the malicious domain. The whole message is then prepended with\na sequence identifier in case the malware needs more than one DNS request to fit the\ninformation in. A couple of example strings with sections bolded to show the boundaries are\nincluded below to demonstrate the encoding:\n```\na.0.0.gy516c.jufh3dycto.ryaukqtwga.7dgp3ykbgo.id.sr.nn.6r.xyf.j61.mi.it.nhi.fif.pp.9k.\na.0.0.gy516cjwfh.3dyctor.yaurqto.go7dnp3ykbgo.id.srnn6rxyfj.61miitnhif.ifpp9kgpf9p.wz3\n\n```\nAs can be seen in the above examples, even when the contents of the message change, the\npart of the URL relating to the MD5 hash remains consistent albeit with different length\nchunks for each send.\n\nWhen sending beacons during the main loop in DNS mode the malware will generate two\nbase64 encoded strings from seven random bytes each and join them with a period to the\ncommand rc. It will then append the previously generated time string after separating it into\nfour separate chunks. Finally, it will append another 10 base64 encoded strings, each\ngenerated from 7 random bytes. Finally the C2 domain is appended to the string and this is\nsent to the C2 as a DNS TXT request\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrc.IIiq2TtU8Q.njp7XG1_7A.gy516c.jwfh3d.yctoryau.rqtu8r7drqjykbgo.XaXwo1pH0w.owxdUchyYw\n\n```\nThe response is expected to contain three TXT records. The first specifies the command that\nis being sent from the C2 and can be either of C or G. These commands operate in the same\nway described previously. If the first command does not match either of these values then\nthe malware reads the data from the third TXT record, decodes it using the custom base32\nalgorithm, RC4 decrypts the result, then gzip decompresses the data to give the final data to\nbe used.\n\nThe commands expected in this data are either the pr command, as previously described, or\na com command. The com option calls the same functions as the default case in the HTTP\nand HTTPS modes which allows the malware to run a cmd shell but then exfiltrates the\noutput via DNS A records.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn contrast to how it has abandoned some previous tooling, Blue Kitsune doubled down on\nits WellMess backdoor by improving its functionality even after it was exposed by open\nsource reporting. The added functionality to support three separate communication protocols\nlikely improves the malware’s ability to avoid detection from network monitoring when the\noriginal HTTP protocol is not desired.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Cyber Emergency\nCenter, [https://www.lac.co.jp/lacwatch/pdf/20180614_cecreport_vol3.pdf, 2018 (Japanese](https://www.lac.co.jp/lacwatch/pdf/20180614_cecreport_vol3.pdf)\nlanguage source)\n\n[2] ‘Malware “WellMess” Targeting Linux and Windows’,\nJPCERT, [https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2018/07/malware-wellmes-9b78.html (6th July 2018)](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2018/07/malware-wellmes-9b78.html)\n\n[3] ‘JPCERTCC/aa-tools’, GitHub, https://github.com/JPCERTCC/aatools/blob/master/wellmess_cookie_decode.py\n\n[4] ‘ISO 3166 Country Codes’, ISO, [https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)\n\nTTPs\nHashes and IP\n\n### TTPs\n\n[Application Layer Protocol: DNS -
