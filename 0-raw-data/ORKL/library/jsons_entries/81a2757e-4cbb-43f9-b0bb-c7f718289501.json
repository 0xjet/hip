While the malware attack has not been exclusively targeting](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-082113-4423-99)\nthe region, it has been focusing on the South Korean manufacturing industry. Duuzer is a\nwell-designed threat that gives attackers remote access to the compromised computer,\ndownloads additional files, and steals data. It’s clearly the work of skilled attackers looking\nto obtain valuable information.\n\nThere is also evidence to suggest that the actors behind Duuzer are spreading two other\nthreats, detected as [W32.Brambul and](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-051114-3802-99) [Backdoor.Joanap, to target more organizations in](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-092507-0410-99)\nSouth Korea. Brambul and Joanap appear to be used to download extra payloads and carry\nout reconnaissance on infected computers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Duuzer: An advanced back door threat**\nDuuzer is an ongoing threat that is being delivered in targeted attacks. While the exact\ndistribution method is unknown, it’s likely that the malware is spreading through spearphishing emails or watering-hole attacks.\n\nThe Trojan has been designed to work on both 32-bit and 64-bit computers. It also detects\nwhether the computer it has infected is a virtual machine that was made using Virtual Box or\nVMware. If this is the case, then Duuzer stops executing. This allows Duuzer to attempt to\nevade detection from security researchers who are running virtual machines that are\ndesigned to be compromised with malware for analysis.\n\nOnce Duuzer infects a computer, it opens a back door, giving the attackers access to\nalmost everything. The attackers can securely connect to the compromised computer\nthrough the threat and perform the following activities:\n\nGather system and drive information\nCreate, enumerate, and end processes\nAccess, modify, and delete files\nUpload and download files\nChange the time attributes of files\nExecute commands\n\nThe Duuzer attackers have been observed trying to disguise their malware on an infected\ncomputer. They do this by identifying what software is installed and runs on startup, then\nrenaming their malware to a similar title of an existing, legitimate program.\n\nBased on our analysis of Duuzer, the attackers behind the threat appear to be experienced\nand have knowledge about security researchers’ analysis techniques. Their motivation\nseems to be obtaining valuable information from their targets’ computers.\n\nThe attackers appear to be manually running commands through the back door on affected\ncomputers. In one case, we observed the attackers creating a camouflaged version of their\nmalware, and in another, we saw them attempting, but failing, to deactivate Symantec\nEndpoint Protection (SEP).\n\n**Duuzer in disguise**\nThe attackers began by querying the Run key in the registry, redirecting the output to a\ntemporary file:\n\ncmd.exe /c \"reg query \"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" >\nC:\\Windows\\TEMP\\BP25B4.tmp\" 2>&1\n\nThey narrowed their query down to a specific user’s Run key:\n\n\n-----\n\ncmd.exe /c reg query HKEY_USERS\\\n\n[REMOVED]\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" >\nC:\\Windows\\TEMP\\BP6380.tmp\" 2>&1\n\nThe attackers discovered that a particular program was installed on the affected computer\nand decided to mimic that software. They created a new folder with the same name as the\nidentified application, but in a different location. They then copied their malware into that\nfolder:\n\ncmd.exe /c \"md C:\\USER_PROFILE\\AppData\\Local\\[REMOVED]\"\n\nThe attackers listed out the attributes for the file that they attempted to mimic. They then\nchanged the attributes of their malicious file to match those of the clean one.\n\ncmd.exe /c \"dir /a \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\[REMOVED]\\[REMOVED] AGENT\\\n\n[REMOVED].exe\" > C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\BPD0B6.tmp\" 2>&1\n\nFinally, the attackers created a new registry entry in the Run subkey to load their malware.\nAgain, they used a similar name to the legitimate application to mimic it.\n\ncmd.exe /c \"reg add \"HKEY_USERS\\\n\n[REMOVED]\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" /v \"\n\n[REMOVED]Agent\" /t REG_SZ /d \"\\\"C:\\USER_PROFILE\\AppData\\Local\\[REMOVED]\\\n\n[REMOVED].exe\\\"\" /f > C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\BPA62F.tmp\" 2>&1\n\nThe attackers launched the camouflaged version of the malware, ended the old instance\nprocess, and deleted the first instance of the malware. At this point, having blended into the\nvictim process, the attackers began to explore the local network using standard network\nenumeration tools.\n\n**Failing to deactivate Symantec Endpoint Protection**\nOn a separate computer, during their network-mapping exercise, the attackers were unable\nto bypass SEP detections and attempted to disable the application. To do this, they installed\nan API-hooking tool in an effort to discover how the security application was interfacing with\nWindows and deactivate it. However, they were unable to stop SEP’s monitoring activities.\n\n**The Brambul/Joanap connection**\nDuring our research, we found a dropper that infects computers with a worm known as\nBrambul and a back door Trojan called Joanap. It’s unclear how the dropper is being\ndistributed, but it’s likely that it comes from malicious emails. Our analysis into Duuzer\nindicates that the Trojan is associated with both Brambul and Joanap. Computers infected\nwith Brambul have been used as command-and-control (C&C) servers for Duuzer and have\nalso been compromised with Duuzer.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Brambul worm uses brute-force attacks to propagate. The threat connects to random\nIP addresses through the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol using a hardcoded list of\nuser names and passwords. The passwords are quite common or easy to guess, such as\n“123123”, “abc123”, “computer,” “iloveyou,” ”login”, and “password”.\n\nAfter Brambul compromises a computer, it creates a net share to give attackers access to\nthe system drive (usually the C: drive). It sends a message with the computer’s details and\nlogin credentials to a hardcoded email address. Brambul’s variants may be able to drop\nadditional threats.\n\nJoanap is dropped alongside Brambul and registers itself as a service with the display\nname “SmartCard Protector.” This threat can open a back door, send specific files to the\nattackers, save or delete files, download and run executables, and launch or end\nprocesses.\n\nJoanap also sends commands and configuration data over an RC4-encrypted connection to\nother computers infected with these threats. These commands could include running or\nending processes, moving or deleting files, and updating C&C details.\n\n**Mitigation**\nDuuzer, Brambul, and Joanap are just a small selection of many threats affecting South\nKorea. The nation has been impacted in high-profile, targeted campaigns over the last few\nyears. According to the region’s National Computing & Information Agency (NCIA), there\n[have been more than 114,035 attacks targeting government agencies between 2011 and](http://www.zdnet.com/article/south-korea-suffers-110000-cyberattacks-in-five-years/)\n2015 so far. The numerous malicious campaigns in the region highlight how attackers\ncontinue to see South Korea as an attractive target.\n\nSymantec recommends that users and businesses adhere to the following best practices to\nprevent their computers from being compromised with this malware:\n\nChange default user names and passwords\n[Avoid using common or easy-to-guess passwords. The Norton Security Center has](http://us.norton.com/dos-donts-passwords/article)\nadvice on how to pick strong passwords.\nEnsure that the operating system and software is regularly updated to prevent known\nvulnerabilities from being exploited\nDon’t open suspicious emails. These messages typically distribute malware through\nmalicious links and attachments.\nKeep security software up-to-date with the latest definitions\n\n**Protection**\n[Norton Security,](https://us.norton.com/) [Symantec Endpoint Protection, and other](https://www.symantec.com/endpoint-protection/) [Symantec security products](http://www.symantec.com/products-solutions/)\nprotect users against these threats through the following detections:\n\n**Antivirus**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Intrusion Prevention System**\n\n[System Infected: Backdoor.Joanap Activity](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=28867)\n\nWe’ve also provided the indicators of compromise for Duuzer, Brambul, and Joanap, as\nfollows:\n\n**Backdoor.Duuzer indicators of compromise**\nMD5\n\n1205c4bd5d02782cc4e66dfa3fef749c\n92d618db54690c6ae193f07a31d92098\n3e6be312a28b2633c8849d3e95e487b5\n41a6d7c944bd84329bd31bb07f83150a\n7343f81a0e42ebf283415da7b3da253f\n73471f41319468ab207b8d5b33b0b4be\n84a3f8941bb4bf15ba28090f8bc0faec\nb04fabf3a7a710aafe5bc2d899c0fc2b\ne04792e8e0959e66499bfacb2a76802b\n3a963e1de08c9920c1dfe923bd4594ff\n51b3e2c7a8ad29f296365972c8452621\n5f05a8f1e545457dbd42fe1329f79452\n91e5a64826f75f74a5ae123abdf7cef5\n9749a4b538022e2602945523192964ad\n9ca7ec51a98c2b16fd7d9a985877a4ba\nbb6cbebd4ffd642d437afc605c32eca0\nfb4caaaf1ac1df378d05111d810a833e\n4b2d221deb0c8042780376cb565532f8\ncd7a72be9c16c2ece1140bc461d6226d\nf032712aa20da98a1bbad7ae5d998767\nf940a21971820a2fcf8433c28be1e967\n71cdcc903f94f56c758121d0b442690f\n0f844300318446a70c022f9487475490\n\nSHA256\n\nfd5a7e54cfdd3b3f32b44d8fdd845e62d6b86c0ddb550c544d659588d06ceaee\n89b25f9a454240a3f52de9bf6f9a829d2b4af04a7d9e9f4136f920f7e372909b\na01bd92c02c9ef7c4785d8bf61ecff734e990b255bba8e22d4513f35f370fd14\nc327de2239034b6f6978884b33582ce97761bcc224239c955f62feebd01e5946\nc7024cf43d285ec9671e8dc1eae87281a6ee6f28e92d69d94474efc2521f03ed\n5a69bce8196b048f8b98f48c8f4950c8b059c43577e35d4af5f26c624140377c\n477ca3e7353938f75032d04e232eb2c298f06f95328bca1a34fce1d8c9d12023\nd57d772eefa6086b5c249efff01189cf4869c2b73007af63affc353474eaafcb\n\n\n-----\n\n4efeea9eeae3d668897206eeccb1444d542ea537ca5c2787f13dd5dadd0e6aaa\na0a6d0e3af6e76264db1e0d4a4ad5745fff15eb2790938718b2c0988b9415b2b\n5b28c86d7e581e52328942b35ece0d0875585fbb4e29378666d1af5be7f56b46\n47181c973a8a69740b710a420ea8f6bf82ce8a613134a8b080b64ce26bb5db93\nfb6d81f4165b41febc739358aeba0fe15048e1d445296e8df9104875be30f9a7\n4a6aba1c182dd8304bac91cc9e1fc39291d78044995f559c1d3bce05afd19982\n7099093177094ea5cc3380b42c2556ed6e8dd06a2f537fa6dd275e5cc1df9c9a\n90d8643e7e52f095ed59ed739167421e45958984c4c9186c4a025e2fd2be668b\n66df7660ddae300b1fcf1098b698868dd6f52db5fcf679fc37a396d28613e66b\n37f652e2060066a1c2c317195573a334416f5a9b9933cfb1ece55bea8048d80f\n6b71465e59eb1e266d47efeaecc256a186d3e08f570bffcfd5ac55e635c67c2a\nd2e03115ef1525f82d70fc691f0360e318ade176a3789cf36969630d9af6901a\n912905ec9d839ca8dfd6771ff5c17aec3516f9ad159a9d627b81261055095fbf\n4cf3a7e17dc4628725dd34b8e98238ed0a2df2dc83189db98d85a38f73706fa5\n\n**W32.Brambul indicators of compromise**\nMD5\n\n1c532fad2c60636654d4c778cfe10408\n1db2dced6dfa04ed75b246ff2784046a\n3844ec6ec70347913bd1156f8cd159b8\n40878869de3fc5f23e14bc3f76541263\n95a5f91931723a65dcd4a3937546da34\n99d9f156c73bd69d5df1a1fe1b08c544\na1ad82988af5d5b2c4003c42a81dda17\nca4c2009bf7ff17d556cc095a4ce06dd\nf273d1283364625f986050bdf7dec8bb\n\nSHA256\n\nc029ae20c314d7a0a2618f38ced03bac99e2ff78a85fe8c8f8de8555a8d153ab\n1da344e5e55bef4307e257edd6f1e14835bdae17538a74afa5fc12c276666112\n9c3e13e93f68970f2844fb8f1f87506f4aa6e87918449e75a63c1126a240c70e\n230c2727e26467e16b5cf3ca37ecb8436ee5df41bfc4cd04062396642f9de352\nd558bb63ed9f613d51badd8fea7e8ea5921a9e31925cd163ec0412e0d999df58\ncbb174815739c679f694e16484a65aa087019272f94bcbf086a92817b4e4154b\n61f46b86741c95336cdac3f07f42b7df3e84695968534be193e98ea76d1070d1\n1dea57b33a48c79743481371a19e17f68ae768a26abc352f21560308698c786f\n8df658cba8f8cf0e2b85007f57d79286eec6309e7a0955dd48bcd15c583a9650\n\n**Backdoor.Joanap indicators of compromise**\nMD5\n\nfd59af723b7a4044ab41f1b2a33350d6\n\n\n-----\n\n4613f51087f01715bf9132c704aea2c2\n074dc6c0fa12cadbc016b8b5b5b7b7c5\n27a3498690d6e86f45229acd2ebc0510\n7a83c6cd46984a84c40d77e9acff28bc\n1d8f0e2375f6bc1e045fa2f25cd4f7e0\n304cea78b53d8baaa2748c7b0bce5dd0\na1ad82988af5d5b2c4003c42a81dda17\n\nSHA256\n\n9a179e1ca07c1f16c4c1c4ee517322d390cbab34b5d123a876b38d08da1face4\na1c483b0ee740291b91b11e18dd05f0a460127acfc19d47b446d11cd0e26d717\n7650d8c0874aa7d1f2a5a7d255112976e9f38ffad8b7cdda76d0baa8f4729203\n5b10cfb236d56a0f3ddaa5e9463ebf307b1d2e0624b0f1c6ece19213804b6826\n0622481f1c1e246289014e9fe3497e69f06ed8b3a327eda86e4442a46790dd2e\n4c5b8c3e0369eb738686c8a111dfe460e26eb3700837c941ea2e9afd3255981e\ncbf5f579ff16206b17f039c2dc0fa35704ec01ede4ba18ecb1fc2c7b8217e54f\n61f46b86741c95336cdac3f07f42b7df3e84695968534be193e98ea76d1070d1\n\n\n-----",
