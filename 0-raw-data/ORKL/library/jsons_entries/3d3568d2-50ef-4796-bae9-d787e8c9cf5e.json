When using Morse code, each letter and number is encoded as a\nseries of dots (short sound) and dashes (long sound).\n\nStarting last week, a threat actor began utilizing Morse code to hide malicious URLs in their\nphishing form to bypass secure mail gateways and mail filters.\n\nBleepingComputer could not find any references to Morse code being used in phishing\nattacks in the past, making this a novel obfuscation technique\n\n\n-----\n\n## The novel Morse code phishing attack\n\nAfter first learning of this attack from a post on [Reddit, BleepingComputer was able to find](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/le2q3v/first_time_ive_seen_this_a_malware_attachement_in/)\nnumerous samples of the targeted attack uploaded to VirusTotal since February 2nd, 2021.\n\nThe phishing attack starts with an email pretending to be an invoice for the company with a\nmail subject like 'Revenue_payment_invoice February_Wednesday 02/03/2021.'\n\n**Phishing email**\nThis email includes an HTML attachment named in such a way as to appear to be an Excel\ninvoice for the company. These attachments are named in the format\n'[company_name]_invoice_[number]._xlsx.hTML.'\n\nFor example, if BleepingComputer was targeted, the attachment would be named\n'bleepingcomputer_invoice_1308._xlsx.hTML.'\n\nWhen viewing the attachment in a text editor, you can see that they include JavaScript that\nmaps letters and numbers to Morse code. For example, the letter 'a' is mapped to '.-' and\nthe letter 'b' is mapped to '-...', as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Source code HTML phishing attachment**\nThe script then calls a decodeMorse() function to decode a Morse code string into a\nhexadecimal string. This hexadecimal string is further decoded into JavaScript tags that are\ninjected into the HTML page.\n\n**Decoded JavaScript tags**\nThese injected scripts combined with the HTML attachment contain the various resources\nnecessary to render a fake Excel spreadsheet that states their sign-in timed out and\nprompts them to enter their password again.\n\n\n-----\n\n**HTML attachment displaying the phishing login form**\nOnce a user enters their password, the form will submit the password to a remote site\nwhere the attackers can collect the login credentials.\n\nThis campaign is highly targeted, with the threat actor using the logo.clearbit.comservice to\ninsert logos for the recipient's companies into the login form to make it more convincing. If a\nlogo is not available, it uses the generic Office 365 logo, as shown in the image above.\n\nBleepingComputer has seen eleven companies targeted by this phishing attack, including\nSGS, Dimensional, Metrohm, SBI (Mauritius) Ltd, NUOVO IMAIE, Bridgestone, Cargeas,\nODDO BHF Asset Management, Dea Capital, Equiniti, and Capital Four.\n\nPhishing scams are becoming more intricate every day as mail gateways become better at\ndetecting malicious emails.\n\nDue to this, everyone must pay close attention to URLs and attachment names before\nsubmitting any information. If something looks at all suspicious, recipients should contact\ntheir network administrators to investigate further.\n\nAs this phishing email uses attachments with double-extension (xlxs and HTML), it is\nimportant to [make sure that Windows file extensions are enabled to make it easier to spot](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/hiding-windows-file-extensions-is-a-security-risk-enable-now/)\nsuspicious attachments.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Phishing websites now use chatbots to steal your credentials](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-websites-now-use-chatbots-to-steal-your-credentials/)\n\n[Fake crypto sites lure wannabe thieves by spamming login credentials](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-crypto-sites-lure-wannabe-thieves-by-spamming-login-credentials/)\n\n[Attackers hijack UK NHS email accounts to steal Microsoft logins](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/attackers-hijack-uk-nhs-email-accounts-to-steal-microsoft-logins/)\n\n[New phishing warns: Your verified Twitter account may be at risk](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-phishing-warns-your-verified-twitter-account-may-be-at-risk/)\n\n[The top 10 password attacks and how to stop them](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-top-10-password-attacks-and-how-to-stop-them/)\n\n[Credentials](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/credentials/)\n[Excel](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/excel/)\n[Morse Code](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/morse-code/)\n[Office 365](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/office-365/)\n[Phishing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/phishing/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
