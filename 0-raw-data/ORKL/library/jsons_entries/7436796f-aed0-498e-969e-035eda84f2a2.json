REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko\n\nWhen the lights went out in northern Kiev on Dec. 17-18, power supplier Ukrenergo\nsuspected a cyber attack and hired investigators to help it determine the cause following a\nseries of breaches across Ukraine\n\n\n-----\n\nPreliminary findings indicate that workstations and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\n(SCADA) systems, linked to the 330 kilowatt sub-station “North”, were influenced by external\nsources outside normal parameters, Ukrenergo said in comments emailed to Reuters.\n\n“The analysis of the impact of symptoms on the initial data of these systems indicates a\npremeditated and multi-level invasion,” Ukrenergo said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials and cyber experts are still working to compile a chronology of\nevents, draw up a list of compromised accounts, and determine the penetration point, while\ntracing computers potentially infected with malware in sleep mode, it said.\n\nThe comments make no mention of which individual, group or country may have been\nbehind the attack.\n\n“It was an intentional cyber incident not meant to be on a large scale... they actually attacked\nmore but couldn’t achieve all their goals,” said Marina Krotofil, lead cyber-security researcher\nat Honeywell, who assisted in the investigation.\n\nIn December 2015, a first-of-its-kind cyber attack cut the lights to 225,000 people in western\nUkraine, with hackers also sabotaging power distribution equipment, complicating attempts\nto restore power.\n\nUkrainian security services blamed that attack on Russia.\n\nIn the latest attack, hackers are thought to have hidden in Ukrenergo’s IT network\nundetected for six months, acquiring privileges to access systems and figure out their\nworkings, before taking methodical steps to take the power offline, Krotofil said.\n\n“The team involved had quite a few people working in it, with very serious tools and an\nengineer who understands the power infrastructure,” she said.\n\nThe attacks against Ukraine’s power grid are widely seen by experts as the first examples of\nhackers shutting off critical energy systems supplying heat and light to millions of homes.\n\nWriting by Oleg Vukmanovic; reporting by Pavel Polityuk in Kiev, Oleg Vukmanovic and\nStephen Jewkes in Milan; editing by Susan Fenton/Ruth Pitchford\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\nfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-up\n\n\n-----",
