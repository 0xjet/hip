And that certainly seems to have been the case for the world’s cyber criminals. As COVID-19 medical and economic programs began to wind down, attackers had to get back to making a living the old-fashioned way: by honing their social engineering skills, enhancing their tooling, and looking for opportunity in unexpected places.\n\nAll of this has led to an explosion in ingenuity. From the commoditization of\nsophisticated techniques like multifactor authentication bypass to threats that rely\nsolely on the attacker’s charm and persuasiveness, the cyber attack chain—and\nthe landscape as a whole—has seen major development on several fronts. And\nwith Microsoft’s moves to curtail abuse of Office macros creating unignorable\npressure to innovate, many threat actors are still experimenting to figure out what\ncomes next.\n\nBut no matter which tactics or techniques attackers turn to, their victims remain\nstubbornly human. Cyber attackers target people. They exploit people. Ultimately,\nthey are people. That’s what makes protecting people from cyber threats such a\nprofound and fascinating challenge.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n 4 Key Findings\n\n\n###### Spotlight on SocGholish\n\n The attack chain\n\n SocGholish attack chain: initial compromise\n\n Emotet attack chain: initial compromise\n\n Goulishly smart social engineering\n\n\n###### 6\n\n 6 6\n\n 7\n 8 10\n 11 12 13\n\n\n###### About This Report\n\n What this report covers\n\n Scope\n\n The Threat Landscape\n\n Leader and losers\n\n Linked or attached?\n\n Top malware\n\n Top lures\n\n Top techniques\n\n\n###### 22\n\n 22 22 22 23\n\n\n###### 25 Chatting with Attackers\n 26 Business email compromise\n\n 25 Spotlight on Emotet\n\n\n###### 14 Identity Crisis\n\n 15 APT Spotlight\n\n\n###### 29\n 30\n 31 31\n\n\n###### Opportunistic Attacks\n\n Russia-Ukraine\n\n Queen Elizabeth II\n\n Silicon Valley Bank\n\n\n###### 32 A Dark Cloud\n 34 Post-access activities 34 Traffic sources\n\n 35 Conclusions\n\n\n###### 16\n 17 18 19 24\n\n\n###### New Developments\n\n MFA bypass\n\n Attack of the TOADs\n\n Forced evolution\n\n Rapid iteration\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Key Findings\n\n### 13 million\n\n# 94%\n###### TOAD messages peaked at more\n of cloud tenants were\n than 13 millon per month\n targeted every month\n Office macro use collapsed after Microsoft rolled out controls\n to block them\n\n Conversational attacks via mobile devices Emotet topped the charts grew twelvefold again, sending over\n\n## x12\n\n### Top 5 MFA-Bypass\n\n###### Novel distribution\n\n accounted for more than a\n pushed SocGholish\n\n### 25 million\n\n###### million messages per month\n into the top-five\n ranking for malware\n\n### messages\n\n###### (by message volume)\n\n|94% of cloud tenants were targeted every month|Col2|Office macro use collapsed after Microsoft rolled out controls to block them|\n|---|---|---|\n|Top 5 Novel distribution pushed SocGholish into the top-five ranking for malware|MFA-Bypass accounted for more than a million messages per month||\n\n\n-----\n\n###### About This Report\n\n For more than 20 years, Proofpoint has been in the business of protecting people and defending data from cyber attacks. In that time, our research has consistently led us toward a simple but powerful observation: people—not technology—are the most critical variable in today’s cyber threats.\n\nThis year, Human Factor report takes an even closer look at new developments\nin the threat landscape, focusing on the combination of technology and\npsychology that makes modern cyber attacks so dangerous.\n\n###### What this report covers\n\nThis report covers threats detected, mitigated and resolved during 2022 among\nProofpoint deployments around the world: one of the largest, most diverse data\nsets in cybersecurity.\n\nWe largely focus on threats that are part of a broader attack campaign, or series\nof actions taken by an attacker to accomplish a goal. Sometimes, we’re able to\nlink these campaigns to a specific threat actor, a process known as attribution.\n\n###### Scope\n\nThe data in this report draws on the Proofpoint Nexus Threat Graph, using data\ncollected from Proofpoint deployments around the globe. Each day, we analyze\nmore than 2.6 billion email messages, 49 billion URLs, 1.9 billion attachments,\n28 million cloud accounts, 1.7 billion suspicious SMS and more. Together, this\namounts to trillions of data points across the digital channels that matter.\n\nThis report covers Jan. 1–Dec. 31, 2022. Where specific campaigns are\ndiscussed, this is the result of direct observation by our global network of threat\nresearchers. Campaigns are defined as a series of common actions taken by a\nsingle attacker to accomplish a goal.\n\nIn a small number of cases, full-year data either wasn’t available or might confuse\nthe point being made. We’ll make it clear where we’ve used a shorter time frame\nor a different source of data.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### SECTION 1\n\n#### The Threat Landscape\n\n\n-----\n\n**TA542:**\n\nThe threat actor behind the Emotet\nmalware. Financially motivated and\nknown for extremely high-volume\nemail campaigns.\n\n**TA511:**\n\nA financially motivated cyber criminal\ngroup. Known for high-volume\ncampaigns targeting a wide range of\nindustries. It has been associated\nwith a number of different malware\nfamilies since first being observed.\n\n\n###### The more things change, the more they stay the same. In some respects, 2022 saw a lot of development in the threat landscape. Attack chains became more varied. Delivery mechanisms were rapidly tested and discarded. And threat actors began to match their ingenuity with new-found patience.\n\nAnd yet, while techniques and tactics evolved—often at breakneck speeds—\nover the course of the year, the identity of the main culprits retained a degree\nof consistency.\n\n###### Leaders and losers\n\nDespite an erratic year, TA542, the entity behind Emotet, regained its place as\nthe world’s most prolific threat actor. Its return to the top comes only a year after\nlaw enforcement took the botnet offline in January 2021. Emotet’s absence last\nyear left the way clear for a new volume leader to step up for the first time in three\nyears. But TA511—last year’s top actor by volume—doesn’t even make the top\n10 this year, falling to 12th place.\n\n**Threat Actors by Message Volume**\n\nTA542 25,616,214\n\nTA569 12,760,306\n\nTA2725 3,331,606\n\nTA577 1,690,885\n\nTA2536 1,124,481\n\nTA544 763,815\n\nTA570 666,015\n\nTA578 288,059\n\nTA5453 161,780\n\nTA579 83,131\n\n\n-----\n\n**TA2541:**\n\nA persistent cyber criminal group\nthat typically targets aviation,\ntransportation and defense\nindustries.\n\n**TA577:**\n\nA prolific cyber criminal group\ntracked since 2020. One of the most\nnotorious Qbot affiliates, this group\nis known to target a wide range of\nverticals.\n\n**initial access facilitator:**\n\nCyber criminal groups that\nspecialize in providing ransomware\nactors with access to compromised\nsystems.\n\n\nOur researchers identify threat actors by looking for patterns in the daily deluge\nof malicious email. When they find activity by a known actor, those messages\nare grouped into a campaign, usually defined by a common social engineering\nstrategy or technique.\n\nRanking actors by the number of discrete campaigns they launch rather than\njust by sheer volume of messages can offer a useful alternative perspective. This\napproach allows us to see which groups are most active across the year and how\nthey alter their tactics and lures.\n\n**Threat Actors by Campaign Volume**\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nTA2541 TA577 TA2725 TA580 TA542 TA558 TA578 TA570 TA551 TA2722\n\nThe top two actors in this chart, TA2541 and TA577 make for an interesting\ncomparison. TA2541 has a tight focus on aerospace, travel and defense\nindustries. Unlike many others, this group tends to ignore current events and\nseasonal themes in its lures, preferring to rely on carefully crafted, industryspecific social engineering.\n\nTA577, on the other hand, takes a completely different approach. A known initial\n**access facilitator, this group targets broadly across both geographies and**\nindustries, and it has delivered a wide variety of different malware over the years.\n\n\n-----\n\n**financially motivated:**\n\nCyber criminals who primarily seek\nto acquire money, either through\ndirect theft or by monetizing stolen\ndata and credentials.\n\n\n**advanced persistent threat:**\n\nThreat actors who primarily work in\nsupport of a national interest. In\nsome rare cases, APT actors also\nengage in financially motivated\nactivity.\n\n\n**Emotet:**\n\nA prolific malware botnet. Apart\nfrom a period during 2021 when\nEmotet was shut down by law\nenforcement, it has typically been\nthe world’s most widely distributed\nmalware.\n\n\n###### Linked or attached?\n\nThe split between URLs and attachments for threat delivery also remained\nconsistent year on year. While there were a few periods when trends grew close,\nURLs accounted for around three quarters of all threats overall.\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\n\nURL Attachment\n\nWhen we break down campaigned threats between financially motivated and\n**advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, we see a difference in approach, with**\nAPT actors far less likely to use attachments.\n\n\nWhile URLs are also the most popular delivery mechanism for cybercrime,\nthe distribution is more even. Some of this may be down to the influence of a\nhandful of large-scale actors. As we’ll see when we take a closer look at EMOTET\nin “Spotlight on Emotet” on page 27, TA542 has a strong attachment to… well,\nattachments.\n\n\n-----\n\n**FormBook:**\n\nThis malware-as-a-service has been\nsold on forums since 2016. Pricing\nis comparatively low, making it a\npopular choice for attackers.\nBecause of this, it’s seen in a wide\nrange of attacks using many\ndifferent social engineering tactics\nand delivery methods.\n\n\n**Delivery Type E-Crime** **Delivery Type APT**\n\nURL\n\n\nAttachment\n\nHybrid\n\n\nMessage\n\n\n**NetSupport:**\n\nA legitimate remote access tool,\nnow widely abused by cyber\ncriminals.\n\n\n**AgentTesla:**\n\nWidely available stealer malware\nthat also acts as a loader for\nsecondary payloads.\n\n\n**SocGholish:**\n\nAn initial access malware delivered\nexclusively by drive-by downloads\nfrom infected websites.\n\n\n###### Top malware\n\nWith TA542 the leading threat actor by volume, it will come as no surprise to see\nEmotet at the top of the malware chart. Commodity malware used by a range of\nthreat actors occupies three of the other four places (FormBook, Netsupport and\n**AgentTesla). But the rise of SocGholish is noteworthy. (We take a detailed look at**\nit in detail in “Spotlight On SocGholish” on page 22.)\n\nEmotet FormBook SocGholish NetSuppot AgentTesla\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Top lures\n\nAbusing our familiarity and trust in major brands is one of the simplest forms of\nsocial engineering. And once again, cyber criminals had an overwhelming favorite\nwhen it came to brand abuse.\n\n\nOffice 365 Microsoft\n\nOutlook\n\n\nAmazon Microsoft\nExcel Online\n\n\nMicrosoft\nSharepoint\n\n\nMicrosoft products and services occupied four of the top five positions for abused\nbrands across all threats, with Amazon taking the other spot. Among campaigns\nreviewed by our researchers, Amazon was actually the most abused brand, but\nMicrosoft still dominated the rest of the top five.\n\nSwitching focus to the topics featured in malicious messages, our researchers\nfound that terms like “payment,” “order,” “invoice” and “purchase” were most\ncommonly used.\n\n\nIn the mobile space, last year’s most popular smishing subject—package delivery\nnotifications—remained prominent in both the U.S. and U.K. But as other lure types\nincreased in the U.K., the overall share of delivery-related smishing messages fell.\n\n**Percentage of Smishing Delivery Lures**\n\n\n50\nU.K.\n\n\n40\n\n30\n\n\nU.S.\n\n\n20\n\n10\n\n\nQ1 2022 Q2 2022 Q3 2022 Q4 2022\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Top techniques\n\nWhen the first Human Factor report debuted almost 10 years ago, one of the\ninsights we wanted to convey was the central role of social engineering in most\ncyber attacks. To this day, it remains the most common technique encountered by\nour researchers. Among the many attacks we classified, the vast majority relied\non some element of psychological manipulation.\n\n**Techniques by Campaign Volume**\n\n8000\n\n7000\n\n6000\n\n5000\n\n4000\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n0\n\n\nSocial Engineering\n\nCompressed Executable\n\nPowerShell\n\nShortcut\n\n\nLCG Kit\n\nPassword Protected\n\nGeofencing\n\nThread Hijacking\n\n\nVBS\n\nJavaScript\n\n\nSocial engineering is endlessly scalable and limited only by attackers’ ingenuity.\nAnd even without the use of malware or technical exploits, the aftermath of a\nsuccessful social engineering attack can be devastating.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Identity Crisis\n\n Whether their chosen mode is phishing or malware distribution, attackers invest a lot of effort into gaining access to corporate credentials and devices. So it’s worth spending a moment to consider why this access is so highly prized.\n\nUser credentials are analogous to identity. Once your login and password are\ncompromised, an attacker effectively becomes you as far as the systems you\nhave access to are concerned. And recent research we undertook into identity\nrisks reveals just how easily a compromised identity can become a big problem.\n\nAt many organizations, the presence of misconfigured or “shadow” admins brings\nadditional risk to credential theft. Local administrators are often missing from\nprivilege account management solutions. And some admin accounts may not be\nknown to IT departments at all, with privileges either misapplied or left in place after\na role change. As many as 40% of these shadow admin identities can be exploited\nin a single step, such as resetting a domain password to elevate privileges. And\n13% of shadow admins were found to already have domain admin privileges.\n\nThe situation is equally promising for malware distributors. We’ve found that as\nmany as 1 in 6 endpoints contain some kind of exploitable identity risk. Around\n10% of endpoints have an unprotected privileged account password, with 26% of\nthose exposed accounts being domain admins. So it’s easy to see how successful\ninitial access can rapidly lead to domain-wide attacks such as ransomware\ninfection or data theft.\n\n##### 1 in 6\n**endpoints**\n**contain risk**\n\n\n-----\n\n**TA471:**\n\nAn advanced persistent threat actor\nthat engages in both corporate and\ngovernment espionage.\n\n**TA416:**\n\nAn advanced persistent threat group\naligned with the Chinese state.\n\n**TA453:**\n\nAn advanced persistent threat group\nthat supports the intelligence needs\nof Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary\nGuard Corps.\n\n\n###### APT Spotlight\n\n As the lure themes mentioned in the last section show, financial motives dominate the threat landscape. So much so, that only a tiny fraction of our customers are targeted by state-sponsored APT actors (and even fewer are targeted by groups aligned with one of the global superpowers).\n\nSince volumes of APT activity are low in comparison to financially motivated cyber\ncrime, a single outlier attack can have an outsized impact on our data. This was\nthe case in 2022, where one large campaign by TA471 propelled that actor to\nthe top of the APT message volume charts. Message volume can mislead; our\nresearchers prefer to describe attributed APT activity in terms of frequency and\nnumber of campaigns. Using this measure, TA416, an APT actor aligned with the\nChinese state, was one of the most active. In particular, our researchers noted\nsignificant new campaigns by TA416 that coincided with the start of the RussiaUkraine war, targeting European diplomatic entities involved in refugee and\nmigrant services.\n\n**APT Actors by Campaign Volume**\n\nTA427\n\nTA453\n\nTA412\n\nTA499\n\nTA416\n\nPrecision and patience are key to much APT activity, with many of these actors\ninvesting significant time exchanging benign messages with their targets to build\nrapport over weeks or even months. Most activity by TA453, the second most\nactive APT group last year, follows this pattern, with the group impersonating\nmultiple personas in some campaigns. The group, which is believed to be aligned\nwith the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran, typically targets academic,\ndissidents, journalists and other figures of political influence. But last year, the\ngroup also targeted medical and aerospace researchers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### SECTION 2\n\n#### New\n Developments\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Over the course of 2022, several technical and tactical innovations grew to become ubiquitous in the threat landscape. In their own way, each signals a dangerous escalation, whether in terms of once- inaccessible tools becoming commoditized, or new methods of manipulation becoming commonplace.\n\n MFA bypass\n\n\nWith multifactor authentication (MFA) turned on, many users assume that their\naccounts and data are secure. After all, a cyber criminal would have to compromise\nyour credentials and have access to the second factor of authentication, such as\nyour mobile, landline or token generator.\n\n\nBut in the tug-of-war between attack and defense, one side rarely keeps hold of an\nadvantage for long. In early 2022, our researchers reported on a new development\nin the world of phish kits. These off-the-shelf tools allow even non-technical\ncriminals to spin up a phishing campaign. The existence of phish kits is nothing\nnew, with recent years seeing the market evolve from a licensing model to\noperators providing fully hosted, phishing as a service. And in 2022, phish kits\ngained a powerful new capability: bypassing MFA.\n\nOct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar\n\n2022 2023\n\nEvilProxy Evilginx2 NakedPages\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n|||\n|||\n|||\n|||\n|Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec 2022|Jan Feb Mar 2023|\n\n\n-----\n\n**EvilProxy:**\n\nA phishing-as-a-service platform\nwith advanced capabilities.\n\n**Evilginx2:**\n\nA red-team tool with advanced\ncapabilities allowing for reverse\nproxy attacks against multi-factor\nauthentication.\n\n**NakedPages:**\n\nAn off-the-shelf phishing kit with\nadvanced capabilities allowing for\nreverse proxy attacks against\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n\nIn the fourth quarter of the year, we gained visibility into attacks using three\nprominent MFA bypass frameworks: EvilProxy, Evilginx2 and NakedPages.\nTogether, these techniques account for hundreds of thousands of malicious\nmessages every month, with EvilProxy continuing to see significant volumes\ninto 2023.\n\nMFA is still an integral part of defense in depth, and activating it remains best\npractice. But the growth of these techniques should signal a loud note of\ncaution: attackers will take everything if you let them—even your MFA tokens.\n\n###### Attack of the TOADs\n\nLast year we reported on an increase in telephone-oriented attack delivery\n(TOAD), a novel technique involving a high degree of interaction between victim\nand attacker. The first stage of a TOAD attack uses pure social engineering.\nUsually, it arrives in the form of a fake subscription invoice or similar, designed to\npersuade victims to call a telephone helpline. But instead of customer service, the\ntarget ends up talking to a cyber criminal. Once they have a victim on the phone,\ncyber attackers can pursue several ploys, from guiding victims into granting\nremote access to their machines to instructing them to download malware.\n\nThis year our systems gained the ability to detect TOAD attacks automatically,\ngiving us a clearer picture of just how ubiquitous this technique has become.\n\n**TOAD Messages**\n\n15M\n\n12M\n\n9M\n\n6M\n\nOCT NOV DEC\n\n\n-----\n\n**BazaCall:**\n\nAn early prominent instance of\ntelephone-oriented attack delivery\nthat infected victims with the now\ndefunct BazaLoader malware.\n\n\nWe now detect and mitigate millions of TOAD messages per month. And while\na percentage of these originate with high-profile attackers like the BazaCall\ngroup responsible for last year’s fake movie streaming sites and unannounced\nJustin Bieber tours, the sheer volumes now involved speak to adoption by less\nsophisticated groups.\n\nTOAD is here to stay; security awareness programs had better jump to it.\n\n\n###### Forced evolution\n\nCyber criminals are innovators, but they don’t innovate for the sake of it. If a tactic\nor technique is successful, they’ll keep at it until defenders catch on. A great\nexample of this is the use of Office macros for malware delivery. The technique\nwas a mainstay for almost two decades—so much so that Microsoft finally\ndecided to do something about it.\n\n\nOver the course of 2022, Microsoft made changes to how its productivity suite\ntreats files downloaded from the internet, making it much harder for cyber\ncriminals to deliver malware through Office documents.\n\n**Total Messages by Macro Type**\n\n\n12\n\n10\n\n\n8\n\n6\n\n\n4\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\nDate 2022\n\n\nVBA Macros XL4 Macros\n\n\n-----\n\n200\n\n180\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\nVolumes of messages containing Office macros fell sharply over the course of the\nyear, with the large spikes in both VBA and XL4 due to Emotet-related activity.\nIn turn, we saw other file types increasing as cyber criminals experimented\nwith new techniques.\n\n**File Type By Campaign Count**\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\nZIP LNK RAR ISO IMG\n\nThreat actor TA577 provides a compelling snapshot of this evolution in practice. A\nprolific Qbot affiliate, TA577 features in the top five threat actors for both message\nand campaign volume. In 2022, the group pivoted away from macros and adopted\nnew techniques, including using various file types such as PDFs, ISOs and virtual\nhard disk (VHD) files.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Techniques Used By TA577 (2022)**\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\n\n###### MACROCALYPSE\n\nWith Office macros no longer a\nreliable malware delivery channel,\nthreat actors turned to PDFs, ISOs\nand virtual hard disk (VHD) files.\n\n\n18\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\nHTML Smuggling ISO PDF Shortcut\n\nVBA Macro VHD WSF XL4 Macro\n\n\nBut the end of Office macros doesn’t mean that attackers turned their backs on\nMicrosoft. At the end of the year, our researchers noted a sudden increase in\ncampaigns abusing the software giant’s OneNote product. Campaigns surged\nin early 2023, and Microsoft has announced plans to increase security measures\nfor files embedded in OneNote documents.\n\n**Number of Campaigns Using OneNote**\n\n\n80\n\n70\n\n\n60\n\n50\n\n\n40\n\n30\n\n\n20\n\n10\n\n\n0\n\n\nDec 22 Jan 23\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Spotlight on SocGholish\n\n One of the year’s standout threats appeared in the form of SocGholish, a malware exclusively delivered by cyber criminal group TA569. Among the threat actors we track, TA569 was the second most prolific after TA542/Emotet. And among malware seen in malicious email, only Emotet and the commodity malware FormBook had a higher message volume.\n\n The attack chain\n\n\n**TA569:**\n\nA cyber criminal group known for\ncompromising content management\nservers to deliver SocGholish. An\ninitial access facilitator, the group\nhas been linked to WastedLocker\nand may have ties to other\nransomware operations.\n\n\nThe cyber attack chain is a model that describes the typical progression of most threats. While every attack is unique in\nsome way, most follow a common sequence. Let’s compare and contrast the initial compromise sequence for two key\nstrains of malware.\n\n**Initial** Lateral\nRecon Persistence Info Gathering PRIV ESC Staging Impact\n**Compromise** Movement\n\n###### SocGholish attack chain: initial compromise\n\nUnlike most of the malware discussed in this report, SocGholish isn’t delivered directly to victims in the form of an\nemailed URL or attachment. In fact, most emails flagged as SocGholish by our systems come from legitimate senders.\nInstead, SocGholish is a “drive-by” malware, which sits on infected websites and tricks victims into downloading it with\nfake browser update alerts.\n\n\n**Initial**\n**Compromise**\n\n\n**Infect host**\n\nMalware can be served from infected\nwebsites. To do this, the attacker\ntakes advantage of a vulnerability with\nthe site or a site component, such as\nadvertising units or embedded assets.\n\n\n**Legitimate email**\n\nInfected sites are often\nunaware that they are\nhosting SocGholish and\nwill continue to send out\nemail to users.\n\n\n**Click URL**\n\nIf recipients click\nthrough to a site\ncontaining SocGholish,\nthey risk infection.\n\n\n**SocGholish installed**\n\nIf a user follows the fake\nupdate instructions,\nSocGholish is installed on\ntheir machine.\n\n**Ransomware or other**\n**follow-on activity**\n\n**Emotet installed**\n\nIf the recipient engages\nwith the malicious\nattachment, Emotet is\ndownloaded and installed\nto their machine.\n\n\nThis year, TA569 was successful in serving malware from some very high-traffic\nwebsite, including, for a brief period, some local and national news sites.\nDuring that time, any email containing a link back to an infected—such as daily\nnewsletters, breaking news alerts or third-party roundups—was flagged for\nposing a risk of SocGholish infection.\n\nIn the specific case of the news websites, administrators identified the source\nof the infection and removed the malicious script in a matter of hours. But\nmany sites hosting SocGholish have no idea they are infected. And to\ncomplicate matters further, TA569 tends to cycle through the sites it has\ncompromised, turning injects on and off, making the task of identifying\ninfected hosts even harder.\n\n**SocGholish Volume 2022**\n\n4M\n\n3M\n\n2M\n\n1M\n\n0M\n\nJan Mar May Jul Sep Nov\n\nBut while SocGholish email volumes are similar to those of other highprofile malware, there is a critical difference in how this threat is spread.\nUnderstanding that difference offers not only the key to defending against\nSocGholish, but also a valuable insight into how social engineering can show\nup in unexpected areas of decision making.\n\n###### Ghoulishly smart social engineering\n\nSocGholish makes for an interesting case study because its attack chain\ncontains both active and passive forms of social engineering. Most obviously,\nthe fake browser update preys upon users’ familiarity with computing\nconventions to persuade them to install malicious software. But beyond this\novert manipulation, our researchers believe TA569 may also have a subtler\npurpose.\n\nEroding user patience with the systems and tools configured to defend them\nis an ambitious goal, but some threat actors have already experienced some\nsuccess. In one of last year’s highest profile breaches, attackers gained\naccess to their target’s systems by bombarding a specific user with MFA push\nrequests on their mobile device. Sufficiently annoyed, that user eventually\nclicked “Yes” to authenticate the log-in attempt. A point of defense became a\npoint of weakness, simply because the attacker made it into an irritant.\n\nIn the case of SocGholish, it’s possible that high volumes of email from\nlegitimate sources being flagged as malicious will eventually cause enough\nfriction that users demand certain sites be safe listed. Or worse, people will\nstart ignoring flagged email warnings altogether. If either of those happen,\nTA569’s success will create a rising tide that lifts all cyber criminal boats.\n\n\n###### Emotet attack chain: initial compromise\n\nCompare that attack chain to Emotet-based attacks, which follow a more traditional pattern.\n\n\n**Fake browser update**\n\nSocGholish typically shows\nusers a pop-up notification\nasking them to download and\ninstall a “browser update”\nthat’s actually malware.\n\n**Interaction with attachment**\n\nOnce an attachment is opened,\nthe recipient usually still has to\ngo further before the threat is\nrealized. In the case of Emotet,\nvictims typically have to click\nto enable Office macros.\n\n\n**Email**\n\nMost malware is delivered by\nmalicious email containing either\nlinks or attachments.\n\n\n**Has attachment**\n\nThe group behind Emotet\nnow stands almost alone\namong large-scale threat\nactors in its use of\nmacro-enabled Office\nattachments.\n\n\n**Attachment is opened**\n\nFor an email threat to\npose a risk, the recipient\nmust first open the\nattachment.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TA2536:**\n\nA long-standing financially\nmotivated cyber criminal group, first\nobserved in 2015. Typically\ndistributes malicious\nOffice documents.\n\n\n###### Rapid iteration\n\nThe fluctuations in the threat landscape are a constant challenge for security\nteams and researchers. The most agile threat actors change social engineering\nstrategies and malware payloads regularly, making them a moving target that can\nbe tough to pin down.\n\n\n**LokiBot:**\n\nCommon stealer malware, first\nidentified in 2016. Also used as a\nbackdoor for secondary infections.\n\n\nA good example of this tendency in 2022 was TA2536, a cyber criminal group\nwe’ve been tracking since 2015. TA2536 largely uses commodity malware,\ndelivering 15 different payloads over the course of the year. AgentTesla and LokiBot\ninformation stealers appeared often in the group’s campaigns, but as the chart\nbelow illustrates, other payloads varied widely.\n\n**TA2536 Different Malware Used Each Month**\n\n\n12\n\n10\n\n\n8\n\n6\n\n\n4\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\n2022\n\nXloader Vidar Snake Keylogger Remcos\n\nRedline njRAT NanoCore Loki Bot\n\nHawkEye GuLoader Formbook AZORult\n\n\nAve Maria AsyncRAT AgentTesla\n\n\n-----\n\n**Pig Butchering:**\n\nA form of conversational threat in which\nbenign messages are exchanged before\nthe attacker seeks to extract money\nfrom victims by persuading them to\ninvest in bogus cryptocurrency\nplatforms.\n\n\n###### Chatting with Attackers\n\n Cyber attack and cyber defense are often deeply technical disciplines. But one of 2022’s most notable developments was also arguably the least technical. Conversational attacks have been a part of the threat landscape for a while. APT attackers, for instance, are known to invest significant time and effort in building rapport with their targets before trying to steal credentials or data. But over the course of the year, our data reveals a significant increase in the number of conversational attacks from financially motivated actors.\n\nIn the mobile space, our Cloudmark division measured a twelvefold increase in\nconversational attacks during the first half of the year, including romance scams,\nfake job ads and “Pig Butchering” cryptocurrency fraud. This growth has made\nconversational lures the most common form of attack in some verticals. Even\naccounting for the impact of simplified abuse reporting in iOS, the data reveals a\nsignificant shift towards conversational approaches across the mobile landscape.\n\n**Conversational Reports: U.S.**\n\n12M\n\n1M\n\n8M\n\n6M\n\n4M\n\n2M\n\n0M\n\n1Q2022 2Q2022 3Q2022 4Q2022\n\n\n-----\n\n###### $2.5B\n\nLosses due to cryptocurrency\nscams in 2022\n\n###### $2.7B\n\nin BEC losses to U.S. companies\n\n###### $34M\n\nin losses from ransomware\n\n\nThe cost of these attacks is considerable. The most recent FBI Internet Crime\n_Report cited more than $2.5 billion in losses due to cryptocurrency scams;[1] pig_\nbutchering is now among the leading examples of this trend. And the losses\naren’t just financial. Conversational approaches work because the victim makes\nan emotional investment in the attacker. In romance scams and pig butchering,\nthe realization that this trust has been misplaced can be every bit as devastating\nas the monetary loss.\n\n###### Business email compromise\n\nWhile the chatty, informal messages typical of pig butchering and romance scams\nare less common in email, certain categories of email threat beyond APT still fit\nthis pattern. Most business email compromise (BEC) does not involve phishing or\nmalware. Instead, attackers use social engineering and other deceptive techniques\nto slip undetected into the normal flow of business communications, sending\nillegitimate invoices, money transfers and similar tasks.\n\n**BEC Message Volume**\n\n4M\n\n3.5M\n\n3M\n\n2.5M\n\n2M\n\n1.5M\n\n0M\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\nBEC is a seemingly low-key threat, attracting far less attention than ransomware\nand data leaks. But according to the FBI Internet Crime Report, BEC cost\nAmerican businesses $2.7 billion last year, with the global figure certain to be\nmuch higher. Ransomware victims, in contrast, lost just $34 million.\n\n1 FBI “Internet Crime Report 2022 ” March 2023\n\n\n-----\n\n**Conti:**\n\nOnce the world’s most infamous\nransomware gang. The group\ndisbanded in 2022 after many of its\ninternal documents were leaked on\nTwitter. Research suggests many\nindividuals associated with Conti\njoined other groups and continue to\nremain active in the cybercriminal\necosystem.\n\n\n###### Spotlight on Emotet\n\n In January 2021, law enforcement shut down the Emotet botnet, making arrests and seizing money and equipment. Overnight, the world’s most prolific malware was taken offline. But optimism from that operation was short-lived. Last November Emotet blinked back into life and began sending out new campaigns. Independent reporting at the time drew a connection between Emotet’s return and moves by the Conti ransomware gang to consolidate its choice of initial access malware.\n\nEmotet activity throughout 2022 was erratic. The only two significant peaks of\nactivity occurred in March and June, and activity shut down completely during\nAugust, September, October and December. Despite this fitful pattern, TA542,\nthe group behind Emotet, still sent more malicious email last year than any other\nthreat actor we track.\n\n**Emotet Message Volume**\n\n12M\n\n10M\n\n8M\n\n6M\n\n4M\n\n2M\n\n0M\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\n\n-----\n\n###### THE EMOTET-CONTI CONNECTION\n\nThe @ContiLeaks disclosures\nconfirmed a close alliance between\nConti and Emotet. The group may\nhave fallen into disarray after Conti\nshut down.\n\n\nOne possible explanation for TA542’s periods of dormancy can be found in\nthe fate of the Conti ransomware group. In late May of last year, the group\nannounced plans to shut down operations. This came after a period of intense\nscrutiny triggered by large amounts of the group’s internal data being leaked on\nTwitter. The @ContiLeaks disclosures confirmed a close alliance between Conti\nand Emotet. Emotet may have experienced a degree of disarray as a result of the\nConti closing its doors.\n\nIt’s also possible that Emotet may simply be biding its time. The group is something\nof an outlier among large-scale threat actors. For instance, it still prefers to distribute\nits malware using attachments, swimming against the tide of URL-based attacks.\nEven so, Emotet conducted a small number of experimental campaigns involving\nURLs. These tests suggest that—like many dominant players—the group may just\nbe taking its time in adapting to the changes going on around it.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### SECTION 3\n\n#### Opportunistic Attacks\n\n\n-----\n\n###### RELIEF AGENCIES IN\n THE CROSSHAIRS\n\nA likely state-sponsored phishing\ncampaign targeted personnel\ninvolved in managing the logistics of\nrefugees fleeing the Russia-Ukraine\nwar. A week later, China-aligned\nTA416 was found targeting similar\nrelief efforts.\n\n\n###### Timeliness is key consideration in social engineering. Lures that refer to recent events or time-sensitive decisions can cause victims to skip some of the scrutiny they might otherwise apply. In recent years, COVID-19 provided attackers with endless headlines and policy decisions to use in their lures. This year, as the pandemic receded into the background in many countries, cyber criminals looked to apply their opportunism elsewhere.\n\n Russia-Ukraine\n\nWhen the Russia-Ukraine war ignited at the end of February, some commentators\npredicted a year of unprecedented cyber conflict. Thankfully, that didn’t happen.\nBut the political, economic and humanitarian upheaval was an opportunity several\nAPT actors couldn’t ignore.\n\nWithin days of the invasion, our researchers identified a likely state-sponsored\nphishing attack using compromised Ukrainian armed service credentials. The\ncampaign targeted European government personnel involved in managing the\nlogistics of refugees fleeing the war. Only a week later, a campaign by Chinaaligned attacker TA416 was uncovered targeting a similar range of relief efforts.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CASHING IN\n ON THE CROWN\n\nA lure purporting to be part of a\ndigital “memorial wall” directed\nvictims to a website that tried to\nharvest their login credentials.\n\n\n###### Queen Elizabeth II\n\nWhile international conflict provided opportunity for state-sponsored attackers,\nfinancially motivated cyber criminals were less choosey. In September, the\ndeath of Queen Elizabeth II led one threat actor to spin up an unusual phishing\ncampaign. The lure purported to be part of a digital “memorial wall” being\nconstructed by Microsoft. If users clicked through to participate, they were\ndirected to a URL that tried to harvest their login credentials.\n\n###### Silicon Valley Bank\n\nThe recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) offers a great illustration of just\nhow quickly cyber attackers can gear up to take advantage of a crisis. Within\nhours of U.S. authorities taking control of the ailing bank in March, our researchers\nsaw dozens of lookalike and typosquatting domains being registered. And almost\nat once, SVB customers began to receive targeted malicious email trying to incite\nmoney transfers or other illicit transactions.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### SECTION 4\n\n#### A Dark Cloud\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Last year we reported on how the ubiquity of cloud infrastructure led to a noteworthy rise in the number of threats faced by cloud tenants. This year, that trend has continued to the point where it is now cloud threats themselves that have become truly ubiquitous\n\n**Percentage of Cloud Tenants Attacked**\n\n100%\n\n90%\n\n80%\n\n70%\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\nSuccessful Precision Attacks Precision Attacks Successful Brute-Force Attacks Brute-Force Attacks\n\n\n###### 62%\n\nof targeted cloud tenants were\nsuccessfully compromised\n\nThe average monthly volume\nof brute-force attacks rose\n###### 400%\n\nin early 2023 vs. the 2022\nmonthly average\n\n\nIn 2022, up to 98% of monitored tenants were targeted by either a precision or a\nbrute-force cloud attack. Attacks were so frequent that in any given month, 94%\nof monitored tenants were targeted, indicating a regularity on par with email and\nmobile vectors.\n\nOf these targeted cloud tenants, 62% were successfully attacked, with the\nmonthly success rate averaging around 20%. This is slightly lower than last year’s\nmonthly figure of 24%, which suggests that cloud administrators may have noted\nthe degree of threat escalation and taken steps to protect their systems and users.\n\nAnother contributing factor to the declining success rate might be found in\nMicrosoft’s deprecation of some legacy email protocols. Removing these less\nsecure options led to a mid-year decline in the success rate of brute-force\nattacks, though precision attacks largely retained their effectiveness. The\nwaning effectiveness of brute-force attacks may have led attackers to double\ndown on volume. As we entered 2023, the number of brute-force attacks in\nour data—notably password spraying—increased from a monthly average\nof around 40 million to nearly 200 million. Still, it seems likely that dwindling\nefficacy will ultimately continue to lead attackers to pivot to other techniques\nand threat vectors.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 14%\n\nof successful cloud attacks led\ndirectly to post-compromise\nmalicious email activity in the\nsecond half of 2022.\n\n###### 13%\n\nof successful cloud attacks led to\nmalicious file activity.\n\n###### 11%\n\nof organizations authorized a\nmalicious third-party app.\n\n\n###### Post-access activities\n\nOnce a cloud tenant has been compromised, threat actors have several options.\nWith a single set of credentials often giving access to email, document storage\nand other single sign-on services, the effects can be severe. Among monitored\ncloud tenants that experienced a successful attack in the second half of last year,\nat least 14% saw outbound post-access malicious email activity. Thread-hijacking\nand impersonation are critical tools in the BEC and supply chain playbooks. So\nmalicious mailbox access could have consequences not just for the attacked\norganization, but for their customers and partners.\n\nPost-access malicious file activity rates were similar, affecting 13% of affected\ntenants in 2022. File activity isn’t only limited to data theft—attackers can also\nupload malicious files containing malware or phishing threats or amend existing\ndocuments, such as supplier payment details.\n\nAttackers’ ability to persist in the compromised environment is a growing challenge\nin cloud-based attacks. Many attackers set up new mailbox rules such as redirects,\nor seek to manipulate multifactor authentication methods, granting a degree\nof persistence even if their access is detected and cut off. Attackers may\nalso authorize malicious OAuth applications, potentially making their access\nmore durable and persistent. At a conservative estimate, at least 11% of\norganizations authorized a malicious third-party application last year.\n\n###### Traffic sources\n\nAs we saw in the lure data presented earlier in this report, using legitimate\ninfrastructure is a tried and trusted technique in social engineering. But it\nalso plays a key role in the delivery of many cloud-based attacks. Around\n8 in 10 organizations faced brute-force attacks using Microsoft, Amazon\nand Cloudflare infrastructure last year. While the threats originating from\nother domains in this list might seem like easy targets for blocklisting, the\npresence of cloud giants such as Microsoft, Amazon and Cloudflare—whose\ninfrastructure hosts countless legitimate services that organizations rely\nupon—shows the limitations of rules-based protections.\n\n**Top 10 Risky Domains**\n\nmicrosoft.com\n\n**86%**\n\namazon.com\n\n**84%**\n\nbiterika.ru\n\n**81%**\n\nnetprotect.com\n\n**80%**\n\ncolorcrossing.com\n\n**79%**\n\ncloudflare.com\n\n**79%**\n\nblazingseollc.com\n\n**79%**\n\nservermania.com\n\n**78%**\n\nhetzner.de\n\n**77%**\n\negihosting.com\n\n**75%**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Conclusion\n\n No matter where attackers look next for inspiration, a people-centric approach to prevention is the key to defending against future threats. Users who are trained to expect the unexpected will be primed to spot a threat and break the attack chain, whether it comes in the form of a note-perfect phishing page or a sly text message purporting to be from an old friend.\n\nCyber attacks are inevitable. But with the right mindset, tools and policies, they\ncan be a manageable risk. Deploy solutions that give you visibility into who’s\nbeing attacked, how they’re being attacked, and whether they clicked.\n\n**Build a robust email fraud defense. Email fraud can be hard to detect. Invest**\nin a solution that can manage email based on custom quarantine and blocking\npolicies. Your solution should analyze both external and internal email—attackers\nmay use compromised accounts to trick users within the same organization.\n\n**Protect cloud accounts from takeover and malicious apps. Attackers are agile and**\ncan pivot on a dime, so every entry point into your systems needs to be covered.\n\n**Partner with a threat intelligence vendor. Focused, targeted attacks call for**\nadvanced threat intelligence. Leverage a solution that combines static and\ndynamic techniques to detect new attack tools, tactics and targets—and then\nlearns from them.\n\nThreat actors are more equipped, creative and motivated than ever. Stopping\nthem requires a multilayered, people-centric approach that spans the entire\nattack chain.\n\nTo learn more about how Proofpoint can protect your people from advanced email\nattacks and identity-based threats, visit proofpoint.com\n\n\n-----\n\n###### LEARN MORE\nTo learn more about how Proofpoint provides insight into your vulnerability-, attack- and privilege-based user risks\n\n[and helps you mitigate them with a people-centric cybersecurity strategy, visit proofpoint.com..](https://www.proofpoint.com/us)\n\n**ABOUT PROOFPOINT**\n\nProofpoint, Inc. is a leading cybersecurity and compliance company that protects organizations’ greatest assets and biggest risks: their people.
