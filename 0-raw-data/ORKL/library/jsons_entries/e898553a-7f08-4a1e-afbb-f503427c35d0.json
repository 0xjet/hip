Talos has a team of dedicated, native-level\nspeakers that translated these documents in their entirety into English. We also translated a\nCobalt Strike manual that the authors referenced while creating their playbook.\n\nThese documents, written mostly in Cyrillic, were allegedly released by an affiliate upset with\nConti. We believe that this translation is an extremely important contribution to the\ncommunity, as machine-translated efforts have missed some interesting insights and led to\nsome garbled passages.\n\nNotably, the [LockBit operator we interviewed warned us that something like this would take](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/02/interview-with-lockbit-ransomware.html)\nplace. They stated that in a ransomware cartel, \"Someone will sell them out from the inside,\"\nwhich is allegedly what took place in this case. The LockBit operator also told us that\nransomware actors use various channels on the messaging app Telegram to stay on top of\n\n\n-----\n\nthe latest exploits and attack trends. A look into a list of Telegram channels deemed\ninteresting by the playbook authors shows numerous channels that were potentially\nleveraged for this exact use.\n\nTalos' main takeaway from this playbook is that operators of all skill levels are involved with\nConti. Some adversaries who are very new to the malware scene could follow this playbook\nto compromise a major, enterprise network with relatively little experience. At the end of this\npost, we've attached a full English translation of the documents.\n\n### Translation notes\n\nWhile translating, our linguists discovered many grammatical mistakes, potentially indicating\nthe writing process was rushed. But based on the language used, the authors likely possess\nat least a high school education. It is unclear whether the document was originally written\nentirely in Russian or they machine translated some English-language documents and\nincluded them in the playbook. The document contains some peculiar word choices that\ncould be caused by auto-translation, or just poor writing. The playbook contains transliterated\nabbreviations, words and phrases, though this could be because there are no equivalents in\nRussian or the authors were unaware or preferred not to use them. However, even if it\nincluded machine translations, the playbook was likely later reviewed and edited to sound\nnatural for a Russian-speaking audience. Regardless, it is clear that the authors pulled\ninformation from a variety of open-source materials in compiling the document. There are\nFrench passages present in various documents, as well, but only as examples of Cobalt\nStrike output, likely indicating that they were created during or copied from an attack\ntargeting French companies.\n\n### Insights into the adversary\n\nReferences to team leads, chats and conferences indicate that the group is at least\nsomewhat well-organized. They also display a familiarity with corporate network\nenvironments, such as where prized assets are located and how to access them. This is\nparticularly true for U.S. and European networks, which they note have enhanced\ndocumentation that provides for easier targeting. Of note, the only \"geographical\" mention by\nthe adversaries was the mention of U.S./EU active directory (AD) structures. Their\ninstructions, which are meticulous and easy to follow, also demonstrate that they are efficient\nand methodical.\n\nThrough the leaker's posts, we learned that the alleged salary for a Conti pentester was\naround $1,500 USD. Several dark web posts noted that this was relatively low and others\nsaid it is more profitable to be legitimately employed than to work with Conti, based on their\n\n\n-----\n\nlow payments as a whole.\n\nActors discuss low payments for Conti.\n\n### Insights into the leaker\n\nFrom information derived from the dark web, we learned the alleged identity of the leaker is\n\"m1Geelka.\" This is apparently a young individual who was a lower-level member of Conti.\n\nm1Geelka claims that they are not a pentester but are interested in IT.\n\nBased on information from their Telegram account, they appear to be based in Ukraine.\nM1Geelka claimed they were not paid by Conti for their services, prompting them to release\nthis information to exact revenge on Conti.\n\n\n-----\n\nPost containing the initial leaked documents.\n\nLater, they claimed they leaked the documents to better understand Conti and not for\nrevenge, and they only leaked elements that could be detectable by anti-virus (AV) software,\nnot more private elements, since the leaker respects the work of their coders.\n\nm1Geelka clarifies their reasons for leaking the documents.\n\n### Barrier to entry\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the biggest takeaways during the translation was the overall thoroughness and detail\nof these playbooks. The level of detail provided could allow even amateur adversaries to\ncarry out destructive ransomware attacks, a much lower barrier to entry than other forms of\nattacks. This lower barrier to entry also may have led to the leak by a disgruntled member\nwho was viewed as less technical (aka \"a script kiddie\") and less important.\n\n### Hunting for admin access\n\nThe adversaries list several ways to hunt for administrator access once on the victim\nnetwork. They use commands such as Net to list users and tools like AdFind to enumerate\nusers with access to Active Directory, and even OSINT, including the use of social media\nsites like LinkedIn to identify roles and users with privileged access. They note that this\nhunting process is particularly easy in U.S. and EU networks because of how they are\nstructured and how roles and responsibilities are commonly detailed in comments.\n\n### Cobalt Strike\n\n[The primary tool described in this playbook is the red-teaming framework Cobalt Strike. The](https://talosintelligence.com/resources/145)\nrelease included a version 4.3 of Cobalt Strike, and the JARM hash for the server matched\nwhat we would expect from a cracked Cobalt Strike server. The tool worked well. The\nplaybook also pulled heavily from a Russian-language manual describing how to conduct\nattacks against Active Directory. We identified the Russian manual the authors were\nleveraging, and have translated and included it as well in this report.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Cobalt Strike version included in the playbook.\n\n### Tools listed by the adversary\n\nBesides Cobalt Strike, our linguists identified several other tools and native Windows utilities\nlisted in the playbook. Of the tools and utilities mentioned, many have been commonly\nassociated with previous ransomware operations, while others appear to be less familiar. Of\nthe tools and command-line utilities the adversary mentioned, Talos identified those that\nhave been commonly used by ransomware operators for reconnaissance and discovery,\nsuch as the use of ADFind to query for information on Active Directory (AD), and whoami to\nenumerate groups the user is a member of.\n\n[These actors also appear to be using two tools — Armitage and](https://tools.kali.org/exploitation-tools/armitage) [SharpView — that are not](https://github.com/tevora-threat/SharpView)\ncommonly seen in Cisco Talos Incident Response (CTIR) ransomware engagements.\nArmitage is a red-team toolkit built on the Metasploit framework that enables the user to\n\n\n-----\n\nlaunch exploits, scans, and more, while SharpView is a .NET port of PowerView, one of\nmany tools contained within the PowerSploit offensive PowerShell toolkit.\n\n[SharpChrome and](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpDPAPI%23sharpchrome) [SeatBelt — two other tools we have not seen used in CTIR ransomware](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt)\nengagements — were also used for credential-dumping. SharpChrome is a Chrome-specific\nimplementation of SharpDPAPI and attempts to decrypt logins and cookies. SeatBelt is a\nproject written in C# that collects system data such as OS information (version, architecture),\nUAC system policies, user folders and more.\n\n### Comparisons to previous ransomware IR engagements involving Conti\n\nOnce our linguists translated the documents, we compared some of the techniques\nmentioned in the manuals and guides with activities and TTPs we have observed in CTIR\nengagements that involved the Conti ransomware. In many ransomware engagements, CTIR\ntypically observes the adversary using PowerShell to disable Windows Defender real-time\nmonitoring. This is in contrast to the adversary's instructions to manually disable real-time\nmonitoring, which is much more interactive and time-consuming.\n\nHowever, PowerShell wasn't the only tool mentioned by these adversaries to disable\nWindows Defender — the adversaries suggest using GMER as an alternative. GMER is a\ntool CTIR has observed across a few ransomware engagements, including at least one Conti\nengagement. GMER is marketed as an \"anti-rootkit\" tool and has been used by ransomware\nactors to identify protections and AV and to stop or remove them. Monitoring for the\nexecution of GMER could help identify precursor activity to ransomware events. Since\nGMER hasn't been updated in several years, hash-based tracking is easy and effective.\n\nCTIR assessed in at least one Conti engagement with a high degree of confidence that the\nadversary potentially had access to every account within the active directory (AD)\nenvironment. This is interesting given that the leaked Conti documents contain a number of\ntechniques and advice on AD hunting in the victim environment. The accounts the adversary\nleveraged in at least one CTIR engagement also included Administrator and IT accounts,\nboth of which were emphasized as valuable targets for AD hunting in the leaked playbook.\n\n[The adversaries also included instructions on CVE-2020-1472 Zerologon exploitation in](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2020-1472)\nCobalt Strike. In a previous Ryuk ransomware engagement from Q2 2021, we observed the\nadversary access several additional resources within that environment and employ a\nprivilege escalation exploit leveraging CVE-2020-1472 to impersonate a domain controller.\nTalos first started observing Ryuk adversaries using the Zerologon privilege-escalation\nvulnerability in September 2020 and continued updating their attacks on the health care and\npublic health sectors in October. Some researchers have described Conti as the successor\nto Ryuk.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nUnfortunately, these ransomware cartels are not going anywhere, and in all likelihood, the\nproblem will likely get worse before it gets better. These translated playbooks have given\noutsiders a glance into the techniques and behaviors of these groups once they are on a\nvictim network, from the tools they leverage to their capabilities in using OSINT to find\nsystems of interest on the network. One thing is certain: They clearly provide comprehensive\ndocumentation to their affiliates.\n\nThis documentation allows both seasoned criminals and those newer to the scene the ability\nto conduct large-scale, damaging campaigns. This shows that although some of the\ntechniques used by these groups are sophisticated, the adversaries carrying out the actual\nattacks may not necessarily be advanced.\n\nAdditionally, this translation will provide defenders with a more complete view into the TTPs\nof these actors. This is an opportunity for defenders to make sure they have logic in place to\ndetect these types of behaviors or compensating controls to help mitigate the risk. This\ntranslation should be viewed as an opportunity for defenders to get a better handle on how\nthese groups operate and the tools they tend to leverage in these attacks.\n\n### Full translation\n\n[here in pdf.](https://talosintelligence.com/resources/269)\nthe [txt files via zip.](https://talosintelligence.com/resources/302)\n\n\n-----",
