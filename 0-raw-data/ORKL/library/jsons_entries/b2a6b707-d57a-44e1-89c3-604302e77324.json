Also known as “BaneChant”, MM Core is a file-less APT which is executed in memory by a\ndownloader component. It was first reported in 2013 under the version number “2.0-LNK” where it used the tag\n“BaneChant” in its command-and-control (C2) network request. A second version “2.1-LNK” with the network tag\n“StrangeLove” was discovered shortly after.\n\nIn this blog we will detail our discovery of the next two versions of MM Core, namely “BigBoss” (2.2-LNK) and\n“SillyGoose” (2.3-LNK). Attacks using \"BigBoss\" appear likely to have occurred since mid-2015,\nwhereas \"SillyGoose\" appears to have been distributed since September 2016. Both versions still appear to be\nactive.\n\n### Targeted Regions and Industries\n\nIn 2013 MM Core was reported to target Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries. Our own telemetry suggests\nthat both Africa and the United States have also been recent targets. The following list shows the targeted industries\nwe have observed:\n\nNews & Media\n\nGovernment - Defence\n\nOil & Gas Manufacturing\n\nTelecommunications\n\n### MM Core Capabilities\n\nAn overview of MM Core backdoor’s functionalities is as follows:\n\nSend infected system’s computer name, windows version, system time, running processes, TCP/IP\nconfiguration, and top level directory listings for drives C to H\n\nDownload and execute file\n\nDownload and execute file in memory\n\nUpdate itself\n\nUninstall itself\n\n## Infection Method\n\nPreviously the MM Core downloader component was downloaded and executed through shellcode by a DOC file\nexploiting CVE 2012-0158. However, the new DOC exploit we found exploits a more recent CVE-2015-1641\nMicrosoft Word vulnerability which it uses to extract embedded malware. The extracted malware is then executed\n\n\n-----\n\nnaval dialogues.doc . This document exploits CVE-2015-1641 and executes shellcode which drops a legitimate\nMicrosoft executable along with a trojanised DLL named “ChoiceGuard.dll”. The shellcode then executes the\nMicrosoft executable, causing the malicious DLL to automatically be loaded into the file when it is run - hence the\nterm \"side-loading\". The DLL downloads and executes the file-less MM Core backdoor in memory, which uses\nsteganography to hide itself inside a JPEG file. The JPEG contains code to decrypt itself using the Shikata ga\nnai algorithm.\n\nOnce decrypted and executed in memory, the MM Core backdoor will extract and install an embedded downloader\nwhen it is first run and add it to Windows start-up for persistence. This downloader, which is similar to the first\ntrojanised DLL, is then executed and will download the MM Core JPEG once again, executing it in memory like\nbefore. This time MM Core will conduct its backdoor routine which will send off system information and await further\ncommands.\n\nAn overview of this infection process is as follows:\n\n## Valid Certificates\n\nSome of the downloader components we found (i.e. \"ChoiceGuard.dll\") are signed with a valid authenticode\ncertificate from Russian organisation \"Bor Port\":\n\n\n-----\n\nWe suspect that this may be a stolen certificate as it is very unlikely that a malware author would sign malware with\ntheir own organisation's certificate.\n\n## Updated Malware Artefacts\n\nNewer versions of MM Core use updated version tags, mutexes, and filenames as compared with their 2013\ncounterparts. These are listed in the table below:\n\n## Evasion Tactics\n\nThe MM Core actors have made significant efforts to prevent security researchers from tracking their\ninfrastructure. The first two versions of MM Core back in 2013 used spoofed registrant information in order to\nregister the C2 domains, whereas the new campaigns use C2s registered using a registrant privacy protection\n\n\n-----\n\nthe noise of legitimate sites that are hosted on the same infrastructure.\n\n## Forcepoint Protection Statement\n\n### Forcepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\nStage 5 (Dropper File) - The malware components are prevented from being downloaded and/or executed.\n\nStage 6 (Call Home) - Network traffic used by the downloaders and MM Core is identified and blocked.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMM Core is an active threat targeting multiple countries and high profile industries. It is interesting to note that even\nthough MM Core’s version has incremented twice, the core backdoor code has remained almost the same apart\nfrom the new file and mutex names. Largely this is perhaps due to the file-less nature of its payload, which may also\nexplain why the majority of the updates were in the delivery mechanism. At the same time this demonstrates that the\nattackers behind MM Core very well know what they are doing, updating the malware just enough to keep their\noperation under the radar after all these years.\n\nOn the other hand, while the volume of related MM Core samples remain low, we noticed that the MM Core\ndownloader shares code, techniques and network infrastructure with a trojan called \"Gratem\", as well as sharing the\nsame authenticode certificate for recent samples. Gratem is a more active downloader malware family which has\nbeen distributed since at least 2014. Ultimately this suggests that MM Core may be a part of a larger operation that\nis yet to be fully uncovered.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n### Documents\n\nd336b8424a65f5c0b83328aa89089c2e4ddbcf72 (US pak track ii naval dialogues.doc)\n\n### Dropper/Downloader Samples (SHA1)\n\nf94bada2e3ef2461f9f9b291aac8ffbf81bf46ab\nef59b4ffc8a92a5a49308ba98cb38949f74774f1\n1cf86d87140f13bf88ede74654e01853bae2413c\n415ad0a84fe7ae5b88a68b8c97d2d27de5b3aed2\ne8bfa4ed85aac19ab2e77e2b6dfe77252288d89b\nf94bada2e3ef2461f9f9b291aac8ffbf81bf46ab\n83e7b2d6ea775c8eb1f6cfefb32df754609a8129\nb931d3988eb37491506504990cae3081208e1a66\n7031f4be6ced5241ae0dd4315d66a261f654dbd6\nab53485990ac503fb9c440ab469771fac661f3cc\nb8e6f570e02d105df2d78698de12ae80d66c54a2\n188776d098f61fa2c3b482b2ace202caee18b411\ne0ed40ec0196543814b00fd0aac7218f23de5ec5\n5498bb49083289dfc2557a7c205aed7f8b97b2a8\nce18064f675348dd327569bd50528286929bc37a\n\n\n-----\n\nf89a81c51e67c0bd3fc738bf927cd7cc95b05ea6\n\n### MM Core Unpacked DLL Samples (SHA1)\n\n13b25ba2b139b9f45e21697ae00cf1b452eeeff5\nc58aac5567df7676c2b08e1235cd70daec3023e8\n4372bb675827922280e8de87a78bf61a6a3e7e4d\n08bfdefef8a1fb1ea6f292b1ed7d709fbbc2c602\n\n### Related Gratem Samples (SHA1)\n\n673f315388d9c3e47adc280da1ff8b85a0893525\nf7372222ec3e56d384e7ca2650eb39c0f420bc88\n\n### Dropper/Downloader Payload Locations\n\nhxxp://davidjone[.]net/huan/normaldot.exe\n\n### MM Core Payload Locations\n\nhxxp://mockingbird.no-ip[.]org/plugins/xim/top.jpg\nhxxp://presspublishing24[.]net/plugins/xim/top.jpg\n\nhxxp://ichoose.zapto[.]org/plugins/cc/me.jpg\nhxxp://presspublishing24[.]net/plugins/cc/me.jpg\n\nhxxp://waterlily.ddns[.]net/plugins/slm/pogo.jpg\nhxxp://presspublishing24[.]net/plugins/slm/pogo.jpg\n\nhxxp://nayanew1.no-ip[.]org/plugins/xim/top.jpg\nhxxp://davidjone[.]net/plugins/xim/top.jpg\n\nhxxp://hawahawa123.no-ip[.]org/plugins/xim/logo.jpg\nhxxp://davidjone[.]net/plugins/xim/logo.jpg\n\n### MM Core C2s\n\nhxxp://presspublishing24[.]net/plugins/cc/mik.php\nhxxp://presspublishing24[.]net/plugins/slm/log.php\nhxxp://presspublishing24[.]net/plugins/xim/trail.php\n\n### Gratem Second Stage Payload Locations\n\nhxxp://adnetwork33.redirectme[.]net/wp-content/themes/booswrap/layers.png\nhxxp://network-resources[.]net/wp-content/themes/booswrap/layers.png\n\nhxxp://adworks.webhop[.]me/wp-content/themes/bmw/s6.png\n\nhxxp://adrev22[.]ddns.net/network/superads/logo.dat\n\n// / / /\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
