If there are no movements, we will sell the remaining,\nmore important and interesting commercial and personal data to third parties, including\nfinancial details.\"\n\nAt this time, Artech's site is down and it is not known if it is due to this attack.\nBleepingComputer has reached out to Artech with questions related to the ransomware\nattack, but have not heard back.\n\nAs we have been saying over and over, ransomware attacks need to be treated with\ntransparency and as a data breach.\n\nBy trying to hide these attacks, and the theft of employee, company, and customer data,\ncompanies are not only risking fines and lawsuits but are also putting personal data at risk.\n\nThis practice of using stolen data as leverage is not going to go away and is only going to\nget worse.\n\n\n-----\n\nExpect to see more ransomware operators began to utilize this practice as it becomes the\nnorm in attacks.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[Data Exfiltration](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-exfiltration/)\n[Extortion](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/extortion/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[REvil](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/revil/)\n[Sodinokibi](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/sodinokibi/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
