The RAT\nmindset is also a growing trend that ThreatFabric analysts have observed in mobile banking\nTrojans over the last years. This blog provides an overview of the changes that took place in\nthe last months on the mobile banking threat landscape and describes why we can expect an\nincrease in the use of Remote Access Trojans for fraudulent purposes.\n\nPlay on words aside, in the world of malware the term RAT stands for Remote Access\nTrojan. This functionality can be added to malware in order to provide the criminal operator\nthe same degree of (remote) control of the infected device as its owner/user has.\n\nRemote access can be achieved in different ways, for example by using more-or-less native\nservices such as SSH (Secure Shell) or RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol), or even by using\nthird-party software such as TeamViewer, VNC or RAdmin. We want to stress that those\ntools by themselves are not inherently malicious and are in most cases used for legitimate\npurposes, such as providing users with support or perform remote administration (hence\n\n\n-----\n\ncalling this type of utilities Remote Administration Tools which can cause confusion). Some\nmalicious actors prefer to develop their own code/tools with the hope to remain under the\nradar while benefiting of similar functionality.\n\nHistorically, mobile banking malware was designed and used primarily to access and steal\ninformation that facilitates financial fraud. Examples of such information include second\nfactors of authentication (SMS, mTAN) and other secrets that could be used to perform fraud\nthrough the targeted banking services. As fraud detection mechanisms used by financial\ninstitutions evolved it became harder for criminals to use aforementioned methods without\nbeing detected.\n\nThreat actors have conceived diverse ways to circumvent detection mechanisms by\nimpersonating the victim’s device. A famous one is the use of a back-connect proxy on the\ninfected device combined with device fingerprints, allowing the actor’s device to look like the\n“real” one. Solutions like device binding and fingerprinting allowed financials to detect such\ntechniques, therefore criminals had to innovate again. In this situation RATs are criminals’\nHoly Grail, as they offer the ability to perform fraudulent transactions directly from the\ninfected (victim) device. By doing so, criminals are making it substantially harder to detect\nfraudulent transactions without a client-based detection solution.\n\nIn Android banking malware, the RAT capability has not been commonly used due to\nlimitations of the Android operating system (it requires use of the Accessibility Service).\nNevertheless, back in 2016 the “Retefe” threat actors were already observed making use of\nRAT functionality by abusing the TeamViewer application, giving them full control over the\ninfected device. As Retefe is run by a group of experienced Windows malware actors and\nbecause RAT capabilities are quite common in Windows banking malware, the actors\nprobably decided to reuse that approach with Android devices as well.\n\nThreat actors motivated by financial gain have noticed the shift of consumers from desktop\ntowards mobile based online banking. This trend has also resulted in the evolution of mobile\nmalware in order to bypass detection measures. From simple SMS-stealer to fully-fledged\nRAT with Automated Transaction Systems, criminals continuously innovate to try to remain\nsuccessful. Hereafter is an overview of recent changes made by some key players in the\nAndroid banking malware threat landscape.\n\n## Cerberus\n\nThe [Cerberus banking Trojan that appeared on the threat landscape end of June 2019 has](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/cerberus-a-new-banking-trojan-from-the-underworld.html)\ntaken over from the infamous Anubis Trojan as major rented banking malware. While offering\na feature-set that enables successful exfiltration of personally identifiable information (PII)\nfrom infected devices, Cerberus was still lacking features that could help lowering the\ndetection barrier during the abuse of stolen information and fraud. Mid-January 2020, after\nnew-year celebrations, Cerberus authors came back with a new variant that aimed to resolve\nthat problem, a RAT feature to perform fraud from the infected device.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis new Cerberus variant has undergone refactoring of the code base and updates of the\nC2 communication protocol, but most notably it got enhanced with the RAT capability,\npossibility to steal device screen-lock credentials (PIN code or swipe pattern) and 2FA\ntokens from the Google Authenticator application.\n\nThe RAT service is able to traverse the file system of the device and download its contents.\nOn top of that it can also launch TeamViewer and setup connections to it, providing threat\nactors full remote access of the device.\n\nOnce TeamViewer is working, it provides actors with many possibilities, including changing\ndevice settings, installing or removing apps, but most notably using any app on the device\n(such as banking apps, messengers and social network apps). It can also provide valuable\ninsight into victim’s behavior and habits; in case it would be used for espionage purposes.\n\nThe following snippet shows the code responsible for TeamViewer login and initialization:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nString runningPackage this.lowerPkgName;\nif(getNodeFromEvent.contains(\"com.teamviewer.host.market\")) {\n  AccessibilityNodeInfo username = AcccesibilityUtils.getNodeFromEvent(event,\n\"com.teamviewer.host.market:id/host\\_assign\\_device_username\");\n  AccessibilityNodeInfo password = AcccesibilityUtils.getNodeFromEvent(event,\n\"com.teamviewer.host.market:id/host\\_assign\\_device_password\");\n  AccessibilityNodeInfo submit = AcccesibilityUtils.getNodeFromEvent(event,\n\"com.teamviewer.host.market:id/host\\_assign\\_device\\_submit\\_button\");\n  if(username != null) {\n    this.teamviewerUsername = this.utils.readShPrStr(this,\nthis.strings.connect_teamviewer);\n    if(!this.teamviewerUsername.isEmpty()) {\n      this.teamviewerPassord = this.utils.readShPrStr(this,\nthis.strings.password);\n      this.credsSubmitted = false;\n      this.passwordFilled = false;\n      this.userFilled = false;\n      this.permissionStatus = 0;\n      this.utils.writeShPrStr(this, this.strings.connect_teamviewer, \"\");\n      this.utils.writeShPrStr(this, this.strings.password, \"\");\n    }\n  }\n  if(this.permissionStatus == 0) {\n    AccessibilityNodeInfo v7\\_7 = AcccesibilityUtils.getNodeFromEvent(event,\n\"com.teamviewer.host.market:id/action\\_bar_root\");\n    if(v7_7 != null && AcccesibilityUtils.getNodeFromEvent(event,\n\"com.teamviewer.host.market:id/buttonPanel\") != null) {\n      this.permissionStatus = 1;\n      AccessibilityNodeInfo tmButton =\nAcccesibilityUtils.getNodeFromEvent(event, \"android:id/button1\");\n      if(tmButton != null) {\n        this.acc_utils.clickButton(tmButton);\n      }\n      AccessibilityNodeInfo klmCheckBox =\nAcccesibilityUtils.getNodeFromEvent(event, \"com.samsung.klmsagent:id/checkBox1\");\n      AccessibilityNodeInfo klmConfirm =\nAcccesibilityUtils.getNodeFromEvent(event, \"com.samsung.klmsagent:id/btn_confirm\");\n      if(klmCheckBox != null && this.permissionStatus == 1) {\n        this.acc_utils.clickButton(klmCheckBox);\n        this.acc_utils.clickButton(klmConfirm);\n        this.permissionStatus = 2;\n        Utils utils = this.utils;\n        utils.launchPkg(this, \"com.teamviewer.host.market\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if(!this.teamviewerUsername.isEmpty() && !this.teamviewerPassord.isEmpty()) {\n    if(username != null && !this.userFilled) {\n      this.acc_utils.setInput(username, this.teamviewerUsername);\n      this.userFilled = true;\n    }\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n    if(password ! null && !this.passwordFilled) {\n      this.acc_utils.setInput(password, this.teamviewerPassord);\n      this.passwordFilled = true;\n    }\n    if((this.userFilled) && (this.passwordFilled) && !this.credsSubmitted) {\n      this.permissionStatus = 0;\n      this.acc_utils.clickButton(submit);\n      this.credsSubmitted = true;\n      String v0_9 = this.utils.readShPrStr(this, this.strings.hidden);\n      if(v0_9.equals(\"true\")) {\n        this.goBack();\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\nThe feature enabling theft of device’s screen lock credentials (PIN and lock pattern) is\npowered by a simple overlay that will require the victim to unlock the device. From the\nimplementation of the RAT we can conclude that this screen-lock credential theft was built in\norder for the actors to be able to remotely unlock the device in order to perform fraud when\nthe victim is not using the device. This once more shows the creativity of criminals to build\nthe right tools to be successful.\n\nAbusing the Accessibility privileges, the Trojan can now also steal 2FA codes from Google\nAuthenticator application. When the app is running, the Trojan can get the content of the\ninterface and can send it to the C2 server. Once again, we can deduce that this functionality\nwill be used to bypass authentication services that rely on OTP codes.\n\nThis is an example of what the Google Authenticator application looks like:\n\n\n-----\n\nUntil now, the end of February 2020, no advertisement for these features has yet been made\nin underground forums. Therefore, we believe that this variant of Cerberus is still in the test\nphase but might be released soon. Having an exhaustive target list including institutions from\nall over the world, combined with its new RAT capability, Cerberus is a critical risk for\nfinancials offering online banking services. Whether in its target list or not, it is easy for its\noperators to enhance the list to target additional apps (refer to the appendix for the current\ntarget list).\n\n\n-----\n\n## Gustuff\n\nThe Gustuff banking Trojan, first spotted in 2016, went through quite a long journey of\nenhancements since its appearance on the threat landscape. Although originally built based\non the infamous Marcher malware, it went through a major refactoring, introducing\nconsiderable changes in its architecture and feature set.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, Gustuff was the first Android banking Trojan that heavily relied\non Android’s Accessibility Service to power its RAT functionality. The RAT was originally\nimplemented to lower detection of fraud but was later enhanced to facilitate automated and\nlarge-scale fraud from the infected devices. Unlike Cerberus, Gustuff’s RAT doesn’t use\nthird-party utilities but uses a home-made JSON-based text protocol instead, to both\nvisualize and interact with content of the infected device’s interface.\n\nIn April 2019 the actors behind the Gustuff Trojan started developing a new version of the bot\nalongside the original one in “production”, resulting in the original Trojan being slowly phased\nout to make place for the new one. Although this process was slow, the new variant started\nreplacing the old one extensively from August 2019 on. After several weeks the swap\nbetween versions was finished. Whilst keeping most of the codebase, the new variant of\nGustuff introduced changes in the architecture and command handling and added some new\nfeatures such as keylogging, browser overlays and even an ATS (Automated Transaction\nSystem) on top of the RAT.\n\nAlthough technically being an overlay attack, browser overlays closely resemble the\ninfamous “webfakes” (popular technique used by Windows banking malware), as instead of\nchecking the package name of running apps, the Trojan abuses Accessibility privileges to\ncheck contents of the browser’s address bar to determine if the victim is accessing a website\nfrom the target list. The browser ends up being overlayed, tricking the victim into interacting\nwith a fake web page.\n\nOne of the first browser overlays built by the Gustuff actors was the public Australian\ngovernment login page:\n\n\n-----\n\nUnlike Cerberus, Gustuff is operated privately and has its main focus on Australian and\nCanadian banks. Targeting financial institutions, crypto-wallets but also government websites\nand job seeking platforms in order to collect more personal information from the victims (see\nthe appendix for targets).\n\nGustuff was the first Android banking Trojan observed to include an ATS, making it more\nadvanced and efficient compared to other similar bankers. The Automated Transaction\nSystem will operate quasi-automatically by stealing victim’s credentials, logging in to its\n\n\n-----\n\naccount to verify validity of credentials and availability of funds, and later logging in again to\nsetup and perform fraudulent transactions, all from the victim’s device. Due to its\ntechnological stand and focus, the Gustuff trojan is a major threat to all targeted parties in its\ntarget list.\n\n## Hydra\n\n[Having its roots as a “dropper services” as described in our BianLian blog, Hydra went a long](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/bianlian_from_rags_to_riches_the_malware_dropper_that_had_a_dream.html)\nway from using outdated overlay attack techniques, to a fully capable banking malware.\nAlthough still having such capability, starting from February 2019, Hydra is no longer used as\ndropper but as a functional and stand-alone banking Trojan.\n\nIt features screencast capabilities (like the Anubis Trojan), enabling actors to visualize what\nis happening on the device in real-time, but also a back-connect proxy option, enabling\nactors to impersonate the infected device and use it to perform fraud. Some other features\ninclude remote app installation, remote screen locking and the possibility to use Google\nfirebase as command handler.\n\nThe following screenshots show some of the overlays used against banks operating in\nTurkey:\n\n\n-----\n\nHydra is operated privately and until recently was targeting exclusively banks operating in\nTurkey and some crypto wallet applications. Beginning 2020, the actors expanded the list of\ntargets to include applications from major banks all around the world (see the appendix for\ntargets). Taking into consideration the ongoing evolution of the Trojan, the expansion of the\ntarget list could either mean that the actors decided to grow their fraud opportunity or that\nthey are planning to enter the malware rental market.\n\nExpanding the target list to more countries and more institutions will also pose new\nchallenges for this Trojan; it means trying to remain undetected by a large spectrum of\nmalware and fraud detection solutions.\n\nThe next important step for Hydra to be successful internationally will be to add a RAT\nfunctionality to its payload. Due to the well-thought-of modular architecture of the bot, actors\nwill certainly be able deal with such enhancements pretty easily; one more reason to keep an\neye on it!\n\n\n-----\n\n## Ginp\n\n[Ginp appeared on the threat landscape in the second half of 2019 as a simple SMS stealer,](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/ginp_a_malware_patchwork_borrowing_from_anubis.html)\ncompletely written from scratch. It is not unusual to see actors attempt to create new\nmalware now and then, but in this particular case the malware started to evolve rapidly,\ngoing through frequent development cycles.\n\nIn the months following its first appearance, it has adopted techniques used by mature\nbanking malware, sometimes even reusing code snippets from existing malware such as\nAnubis. By fall 2019, Ginp was already a fully-fledged banking Trojan, capable of performing\ncredit card and credential theft using overlay attacks.\n\nThe frequency at which this Trojan is evolving is quite surprising: authors have issued more\nthan 10 different variants of the bot in 4 months. Here we highlight the important mutations\nthat Ginp took in that time span:\n\n**Date** **Description of changes**\n\nJune 2019 Simple SMS stealer\n\n\nAugust\n2019\n\nOctober\n2019\n\nNovember\n2019\n\nNovember\n2019\n\nDecember\n2019\n\nDecember\n2019\n\nDecember\n2019\n\nDecember\n2019\n\nDecember\n2019\n\nDecember\n2019\n\n\nGeneric card grabber overlay capability and abuse of Accessibility Service\n\nPayload obfuscation and card grabber overlays specific per target\n\nComplete overlay capability with credential theft and reuse of Anubis Trojan\ncode\n\nPossibility to request additional permissions and bypass battery optimization\nrules\n\nOverlay attacks through push notifications\n\nDoze mode and SharedPreferences updates through command\n\nKeylogging capability\n\nAdded show alert command and delays for specific features such as\ngranting permissions and injects\n\nExpanded list of targets\n\nAdded get phone number command\n\n\n-----\n\n**Date** **Description of changes**\n\n\nDecember\n2019\n\nJanuary\n2020\n\nJanuary\n2020\n\nMarch\n2020\n\n\nHard-coded targets changed from banking apps to social ones\n\nAdded [androidx library and stop notifications, call forward, send fake SMS](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx)\nand ringtone commands\n\nAdded get running processes and get current activity commands\n\nAdded VNC capabilities\n\n\nAnother aspect that makes Ginp stand out is the Modus Operandi of its overlay attacks. As\nvisible in the following screenshots of overlays, a remarkable differentiator of Ginp is that all\nits overlay screens for banking apps consist of at least two steps. The first page of the\noverlay is used to steal the login credentials, the second one to steal the credit card details.\nThe social-engineering trick is encouraging the victim to “validate” its identity and therefore\nprovide all the previously mentioned information.\n\nThe following screenshots show a set of overlays used by Ginp:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nSo far authors of the Trojan seemed to keep the Trojan private. The actual narrow and very\nfocused target list (see appendix) indicate a certain knowledge and interest in Spanish\nbanks, which could indicate authors’ familiarity with the country.\n\nAlthough capable of stealing basic personal information from victims, Ginp is yet still lacking\nfunctionality when it comes to remaining undetected while performing fraud. Although there\nis an actual gap, looking at how fast and frequent new versions of the Ginp Trojan are\nreleased, there is a high chance that the challenge will be taken care of soon. We can expect\nGinp to evolve further in order to circumvent fraud detection measures and therefore also\noffer functions such as screencast, back connect proxy and possibly even RAT.\n\n### Update 10/03/2020\n\nAt the end of February the actors behind Ginp added screen capture capabilities to their\nTrojan. Like previously added functionality, the code is borrowed from the leaked Anubis\nTrojan source code. It enables the bot to stream screenshots and send them to the C2 so\nthat actors can see what is happening on the screen of the infected device.\n\n## Anubis\n\nAlthough no longer officially supported since the conviction of its author, Anubis is still a\ncommon choice of criminals when it comes to Android banking malware. Since both client\nand server source code are publicly accessible for free, this does not come as a surprise.\nSome of the new users even made changes to it, fixing the bugs and gradually improving\nsome aspects of the Trojan to sell or rent it in underground forums.\n\nEven though some changes have been observed in certain Anubis campaigns, no major\nchanges have been introduced by those secondary sellers. Most changes are either fixes of\nknown issues or improvements of existing features (such as automatic disabling of Google\nPlay Protect). In January 2020 a new sales post appeared in some underground forum\noffering a modified version of Anubis 2.5 actually promising a RAT feature:\n\n\n-----\n\nTranslation:\n\n_Additionally, at the moment we develop VNC (commonly used as a synonym for RAT in the_\n_malware community). It will be implemented in the coming month. Persons, who supported_\n_the service by purchasing the bot, will be granted a chance to work as our partners, build will_\n_cost around 15k. Maybe a little less._\n\n_With VNC implemented, bot will install an app from the Google Play store on the victim’s_\n_device and after that you will get an access code. The victim will be able to see when you are_\n_accessing the device, it is not possible to hide that process in Android. However, we will add_\n_the feature that will allow disabling the screenlock. If the screen of the device is locked, bot_\n_will receive the command to unblock the device. After that you can connect to the phone and_\n_perform necessary transactions. It should be OK for nighttime; you shouldn’t have any_\n_problems._\n\n_I accept your requests to add any feature to the bot. We will discuss prices individually._\n_Injects will happen once in 3-4 months._\n\nJudging by this humble and not very technical description, it seems that the actors behind\nthis post chose an implementation similar to how Cerberus is offering its RAT feature: using a\nthird-party application to control the infected device. Although this statement should be taken\nwith caution (there is no honor among the thieves), there is a high chance we will see new\nvariants of the Anubis Trojan offering a fully-fledged RAT, keeping the malware relevant in\nthe current threat landscape.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe [arrest in April 2019 of “maza-in”, author of the Anubis Trojan, caused a shortage of](https://twitter.com/ThreatFabric/status/1162283463891750913)\nrented and supported Android banking Trojan in the mobile threat landscape. It resulted in\nmany actors staying low and scared, unable to use a convenient banking Trojan. Anubis\n\n\n-----\n\nfollowed the fate of Exobot and GMBot, becoming a free publicly available banking malware\nthat was shadowed by commercial products.\n\nThe aforementioned calm, however, didn’t last for long. Shortly after discontinuity of the\nAnubis malware rental service, a new successful commercial service appeared which is\noperational to this date - Cerberus. In addition, some actors chose to start development of\ntheir own banking Trojans, resulting in new malware such as Ginp.\n\nExisting banking Trojans have continued evolving in order to remain relevant and successful.\nCreative and inventive, certain threat actors have been able to enhance their malicious tools\nto remain under the radar while growing fraud revenue. Gustuff and Hydra are good\nexamples of such with their own view on implementation of Automated Transaction Systems\nand Remote Access.\n\nThis year we can expect the threat landscape to evolve further, with new banking malware\nfamilies appearing and older ones being enhanced with new capabilities. It seems that in\norder to keep up with contemporary fraud detection solutions and successfully perform fraud,\nmalware authors will continue implementing features that facilitate on-device fraud. More\nthan ever, a clear overview and understanding of the threat landscape is crucial, and tools to\ndetect the presence of such malware on devices have become invaluable to avoid fraud.\n\n## Mobile Threat Intelligence\n\nOur threat intelligence solution – MTI, provides the context and in-depth knowledge of the\npast and present malware-powered threats in order to understand the future of the threat\nlandscape. Such intelligence, includes both the strategic overview on trends and the\noperational indicators to discern early signals of upcoming threats and build a future-proof\nsecurity strategy.\n\n## Client Side Detection\n\nOur online fraud detection solution – CSD, presents financial institutions with the real-time\noverview on the risk status of their online channels and related devices. This overview\nprovides all the relevant information and context to act upon threats before they turn into\nfraud.
