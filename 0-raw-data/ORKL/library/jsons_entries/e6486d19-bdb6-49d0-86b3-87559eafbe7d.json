malware\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-supporters-in-germany-targeted-with-powershell-rat-malware/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-supporters-in-germany-targeted-with-powershell-rat-malware/)**\n\nBill Toulas\n\nBy\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nMay 16, 2022\n02:05 PM\n5\n\n\n-----\n\nAn unknown threat actor is targeting German users interested in the Ukraine crisis, infecting\nthem with a custom PowerShell RAT (remote access trojan) and stealing their data.\n\nThe malware campaign uses a decoy site to lure users into fake news bulletins that\nsupposedly contain unreleased information about the situation in Ukraine.\n\nThese sites offer malicious documents that install a custom RAT that supports remote\ncommand execution and file operations.\n\nThe campaign was uncovered by threat analysts at Malwarebytes, who have provided all\nthe details and indicators of compromise in their write-up.\n\n## Campaign details\n\nThe domain used in these attacks is \"collaboration-bw[.]de,\" which the threat actor\nregistered when the domain expired and then cloned the look of the real site.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Real and fake site** _(Malwarebytes)_\nVisitors of the site will find a file called \"2022-Q2-Bedrohungslage-Ukraine,\" promising\ninformation about the situation in Ukraine and offered for free download.\n\n\n-----\n\n**The news lure and the download button** _(Malwarebytes)_\nThe corresponding section on the site claims that the document is constantly updated with\nnew information, so users are urged to get a fresh copy every day.\n\nThe downloaded ZIP archive contains a CHM file consisting of several compiled HTML files.\nIf the victim opens it, they are served a bogus error message.\n\n\n-----\n\n**The error message served upon execution** _(Malwarebytes)_\nIn the background, however, the file triggers PowerShell that runs a Base64 deobfuscator\nleading to fetching and executing a malicious script from the fake site.\n\n**The script that fetches the payload** _(Malwarebytes)_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe script eventually drops two files onto the victim s computer, the RAT in .txt file form and\na .cmd file that helps execute it through PowerShell.\n\n## PowerShell RAT\n\nThe custom PowerShell RAT that hides in \"Status.txt\" begins its malicious operation by\ncollecting basic system information and assigning a unique client ID.\n\nThis information and anything else stolen from the host computers is exfiltrated to a\nGerman domain, \"kleinm[.]de\".\n\nTo bypass Windows AMSI (Anti-malware Scan Interface), the RAT uses an AES-encrypted\nfunction named \"bypass,\" decrypted on the fly using a generated key.\n\n**Bypass function details** _(Malwarebytes)_\nThe main capabilities of the RAT are the following:\n\nDownload files from the C2 server\nUpload files to the C2 server\nLoad and execute a PowerShell script\nExecute a specific command\n\nHowever, Malwarebytes does not give specific examples of how the threat actor used the\nRAT and its capabilities in the wild, so the campaign's goals remain unknown.\n\n\"It is not easy to attribute this activity to a specific actor, and there are no solid indicators to\n[support attribution,\" explains Malwarebytes in the report.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-intelligence/2022/05/custom-powershell-rat-targets-germans-seeking-information-about-the-ukraine-crisis/)\n\n\"Based on motivation alone, we hypothesize that a Russian threat actor could be targeting\nGerman users, but without clear connections in infrastructure or similarities to known TTPs,\nsuch attribution is weak.\"\n\nThe critical takeaway is to be cautious with file downloads from the web, as even known\nand previously trustworthy websites may have quietly changed hands.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen it comes to news sites like this one, offering stories in file format instead of hosting\neverything on a web page is rarely justified by legitimate reasons, so treat it as a red flag.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with

They simply no longer want to\nknow!\n\nThere is no question that Putin is the same garbage as Biden and the others, there is\nno good side in this conflict here. But putting all the blame on Putin is just being wrong\nand stupid. His offer not to start any war was INTENTIONALLY ignored for weeks, or\neven years by the american governments of Obama, Trump and Biden.. And why\nwouldn't they? Only all the other involved countries stand to loose enormously.\nThe US will make windfall profits through weapons sales... and their sales of ugly, dirty\ngas....\nAnd as always others fight america's wars, and others countries will be destroyed, the\nUS stays clean, as always. And the americans the same ugly ingnorant idiots.\n\nOne can hope that the war spills into western Europe, and the idiots there get what\nthey deserve, for sticking with the US. And the second hope is, that the US itself one\nday will make the same mistake in the Taiwan affair, because the Chinese will not\nprefer to \"nice\", they will bring that war the US. There will be Champagne.....\n\nWe others live in the same world of barbaric criminal countries, with the US number\none, Israel #2, China #3 and Russia #4.\nHave a nice future...\n\n\n-----\n\n[yawnshard - 1 week ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/1172847/yawnshard/)\n\nWhat is with this profuse argumentum ad hominem?
