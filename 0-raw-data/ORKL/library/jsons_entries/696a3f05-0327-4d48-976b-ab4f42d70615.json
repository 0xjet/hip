From numerous conference talks, to blogs and papers, to various applications in CTI analysis,\nthe question of threat attribution repeatedly emerges. While CTI attribution discussions can take many forms\nand aim at specific audiences—for example, policy-makers and state strategy —this discussion will focus on the1\n\ntechnical analyst’s perspective. In adopting this viewpoint, the question of attribution typically manifests in a very\nbinary fashion. Whereas attribution, as described below, represents various gradations, most discussion limits2\n\nitself to “yes or no” discussions as to the value and need for CTI attribution, when the actual answer (as with most\nthings in CTI) is, “it depends.”\n\nIn this paper, a concept of attribution that moves the CTI community away from binary conceptions of CTI\nattribution value and instead approaches a continuum of attribution types will be introduced. In doing so, multiple\npossibilities emerge for CTI attributive statements, of different values and significance for different parties—as\n\n1\n“Publicly attributing cyber attacks: a framework” - Florian J.

Through this discussion, the\nrelative value of different types of statements will be examined. Additionally, critical consideration will be applied\nto why some positions along the emerging continuum of attribution types may be less than desirable for all\nparties, and ultimately best avoided.\n\n# Defining an Attribution Continuum\n\nAt present, no shortage exists of discussions on CTI attribution. From brief, general media overviews to multiple\nin-depth academic works to vendor-specific methodology discussions, various perspectives exist on the subject3\n\nof how and why to perform CTI attribution. Yet common to nearly all these approaches is a focus on a binary4\n\nperspective with respect to the value of attribution: whether such activity is desirable, or should be ignored. This\nview results in a false dichotomy of either an “all in” approach of threat actor attribution or ignoring the subject as\neither not useful for defenders, or not possible for most CTI analysts.\n\nResulting debates differentiate between attribution as a way of identifying perpetrators and actors responsible\nfor given cyber operations, and more behavior-centric clustering of identified activity to delineate sets of\ncommon tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This separation of behavioral clustering from “attribution” is\nreflected in academic literature, where attribution is frequently defined in the following, “who-centric” manner:\n\n_“[A]ttribution” [is] “determining the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s_\n_intermediary.” A resulting identity may be a person’s name, an account, an alias, or similar_\n_information associated with a person. A location may include physical (geographic) location, or_\n_a virtual location such as an IP address or Ethernet address.[5]_\n\nThis view of attribution—focusing on the definition of a specific organization or even person behind operations as\nwell as characteristics of that organization—seems far too narrow to reflect operational realities for the overall\nconcept. If we instead adopt a perspective where “attribution” represents the identification or classification of an\nincident to a given entity where entity is a flexible identifier ranging from “how-centric” attribution, linking\nobservations to clusters of similar behaviors or TTPs, to very specific “who-focused” attribution, referencing a\nspecific person or organization, multiple possibilities emerge. In adopting this view, analysts approach a range of\nattribution options which can be mapped to a continuum, such as the following representation:\n\n3\nExamples include: “Threat Attribution: Misunderstood & Abused” - MalwareBytes & DarkReading\n[(https://www.darkreading.com/partner-perspectives/malwarebytes/threat-attribution-misunderstood-and-abused/a/d-id/1](https://www.darkreading.com/partner-perspectives/malwarebytes/threat-attribution-misunderstood-and-abused/a/d-id/1327915)\n[327915); “Strategies for Resolving the Cyber Attribution Challenge” - Panayotis A.

By exploring the “poles” of this continuum—Behavioral Attribution on the far\nleft, and Primary Attribution on the far right—we can gain greater insights into the attribution process and its\nimplications.\n\n## Behavioral Attribution\n\nThe left pole of the attribution continuum focuses primarily on technical observables and evidence. Related items\ninclude malware samples, network infrastructure, logs and system artifacts, and similar observations. Residing\nwithin technical observations and observed activities, this type of attribution centers on how a given event took\nplace while abstracting away from who might be responsible. Network defenders as well as CTI vendors and\nanalysts will typically reside primarily in this realm, as the majority of (if not all) available evidence relating to\ncyber operations typically resides in this region.\n\nClustering related activity based on technical observations, behaviors, or TTPs represents a fundamental element\nof cybersecurity, and is applied by multiple vendors and analysts when generating intelligence products. Central\nto the concept is remaining faithful to the evidence on hand, and not projecting further than available information\nallows. In this fashion, Behavioral Attribution—though still quite complex and often difficult to execute in\npractice—remains both grounded in existing observations while remaining accessible to a variety of parties.\n\n\n-----\n\nTypical names for Behavioral Attribution include activity groups, behavioral clusters, and similar nomenclature.[6]\n\nImportantly, the resulting names and “designators” assigned to the resulting clusters are representative of an\nanalytical methodology—how the observations were clustered—as opposed to any inherent attribute of the\nresponsible party. Thus the names and cryptonyms used by vendors and analysts in Behavioral Attribution are\nmeaningful primarily in the sense of acting as placeholders. An APT number or adjective describing a behavioral7\n\ncluster simply reflects the collection of evidence and the methodology used to link observations, rather than\nadhering to the specific entity or party responsible for creating the observations in the first place.\n\nOverall Behavioral Attribution seeks to bucket and group observations as they are linked through technical\nanalysis or observation within technical artifacts. As such, this type of attribution can be quite powerful in\ngrouping similar activities while respecting the boundaries of available evidence. However, such an approach also\nwill, by definition, fail to generate any understanding as to the identity or motivations of the party responsible for\na given operation. Certainly there is some scope to infer intentionality—for example, the presence of code\ndesigned to delete data, as in Shamoon, or a “ransomware” routine that does not allow for decryption, as seen in\nNotPetya, gives insight into adversary intent —but further links to purpose, desire, and motivation require8\n\ninferences that are difficult to defend absent significant non-technical evidence.\n\n## Primary Attribution\n\nThe right pole of the attribution continuum incorporates significant non-technical data to flesh out information\nabout the perpetrators of a given cyber incident as opposed to details and aspects of the incident itself. Unlike\nBehavioral Attribution, this “who-centric” approach to attribution extends beyond technical observables to\nincorporate evidence relating to or describing the entity responsible.\n\n6\n“The Diamond Model: An Analyst’s Best Friend” - Sergio Caltagirone, Dragos\n[(https://www.dragos.com/resource/the-diamond-model-an-analysts-best-friend/); Vanderlee](https://www.dragos.com/resource/the-diamond-model-an-analysts-best-friend/)\n\n7 “Naming, Necessity, and Activity Group Attribution” - Joe Slowik, Stranded on Pylos\n[(https://pylos.co/2018/06/04/naming-necessity-and-activity-group-attribution/)](https://pylos.co/2018/06/04/naming-necessity-and-activity-group-attribution/)\n\n8 “Shamoon The Wiper: Further Details (Part II)” - Dmitry Tarakanov, Kaspersky\n[(https://securelist.com/shamoon-the-wiper-further-details-part-ii/57784/); “ExPetr/Petya/NotPetya is a Wiper, Not](https://securelist.com/shamoon-the-wiper-further-details-part-ii/57784/)\nRansomware” - Anton Ivanov & Orkhan Mamedov, Kaspersky\n[(https://securelist.com/expetrpetyanotpetya-is-a-wiper-not-ransomware/78902/)](https://securelist.com/expetrpetyanotpetya-is-a-wiper-not-ransomware/78902/)\n\n\n-----\n\nPrimary Attribution delves to the source of activity, rather than just\nits externally observable features. As such, Primary Attribution\nseeks to determine precisely who is responsible for a given event,\npotentially down to the identity of specific persons. The information\nrequired to make such assessments is difficult to gather, and in\nmany cases not available to private parties. Occasionally CTI\nvendors are able to gather information allowing for Primary\nAttribution statements, such as Mandiant’s seminal APT1 report\nlinking the identified activity to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)\nUnit 61398. Other entities, such as Citizen Lab based at the9\n\nUniversity of Toronto or the Bellingcat organization, may also\noccasionally reach supportable Primary Attribution conclusions\nwith respect to cyber activity. More often, the required information\nto link activity to specific organizations or persons resides in\ncapabilities reserved for government use: law enforcement\nauthorities such as warrants or subpoenas; lawful interception of\ncommunications; or Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Human Intelligence (HUMINT) collection and analysis\nconducted by intelligence agencies.\n\nCentral to these capabilities is the ability to move from technical observation to identification of a persona\nresponsible for that activity. To satisfy the evidentiary needs of Primary Attribution, investigations must move\ninto “who-focused” avenues where private entities not only are ill equipped to operate, but often are prohibited\nfrom doing so by law. As a result, independent researchers and analysts often get the best glimpses of Primary\nAttribution statements through public releases by government entities in the form of indictments, sanctions, or\nsimilar actions specifying parties related to a given cyber operation. By correlating technical observations to the\npublicly documented incident, CTI analysts can perform transitive attribution through this available evidence to\nget close to Primary Attribution statements.\n\nWhile Behavioral Attribution remains foremost in importance for frontline defenders, in that such an approach\nfocuses on the actual how behind or shaping operations, Primary Attribution, when done well and properly, has\nsignificant benefits as well. When correctly performed with proper evidence, Primary Attribution can link events\nto specific groups or personas which allows for reasonable estimation of intention or purpose. When combined\nwith technical observations, such visibility can be very powerful in enabling defender response. Yet given the\nevidentiary requirements of Primary Attribution, typically such information (and more importantly, finalized\nanalysis) is not available until well after events have transpired, making this approach valuable but typically not\napplicable to operational network defense.\n\n9\n“APT1: Exposing one of China’s Cyber Espionage Units” - Mandiant\n(https://www.freeye.com/content/dam/fi [reeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdfi](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf) )\n\n\n-----\n\n## General Attribution\n\nFinally, while significant “left-” and “right-tail” space exists adjacent to the poles of Behavioral and Primary\nAttribution—where either some evidence exists to migrate slightly beyond behaviors, or not enough allows for\ndefinitive assignment to a specific group—a middle ground is also present. In this case, analysts move beyond pure\ntechnical observations, but lack the evidence necessary to link activity to a specific group, person, or related\nentity.\n\nThis middle ground typically represents the most accessible degree of “who-centric” attribution for most analysts\nand vendors. Yet its value is questionable, along with the possibility of allowing for assumptions and bias to leak\ninto analysis. The easiest way to conceptualize this type of attribution, General Attribution, is through statements\nsuch as “this incident is linked to China” or “this event is tied to ransomware operators working out of Romania” or\nsimilar generic statements.\n\nIn addition to approaches where limited evidence or projections of intent allow migration from Behavioral\nAttribution toward General Attribution, it is also possible for attributive statements to degrade over time from\nPrimary Attribution. In this scenario, an analyst encounters external evidence (an indictment, sanctions, or similar\nprimary source evidence) enabling Primary Attribution statements related to specific activity. But, as illustrated\nin the above diagram, such statements are valid only for the activity covered by the given evidence and its\ncircumstances. Subsequently, such evidence decays toward General Attribution statements where we can link\nsubsequent activity to historical incidents tied to a specific party, but such links are no longer as firm as they were\ninitially.\n\nGeneral Attribution claims identify a geographic region and potentially general interest, but fail to move beyond\nsuch statements to precise identification of responsible parties or motivations. While these may seem as on their\nface useful in providing rough guidance to what entity may be responsible for a given operation, such an approach\ncarries significant and worrisome assumptions. Most importantly, this approach assumes that entities such as\n“China” or “Romanian criminal elements” are unitary actors with similar (if not identical) motivations and goals,\n\n\n-----\n\nwhen all available evidence indicates significant diversity among such higher-level groupings of cyber operators.\nJust as a continuum exists reflecting degrees of attribution, we can also view state-directed cyber operations as\nresiding along a continuum of motivations and degrees of responsibility.10 General Attribution to a diverse entity,\n\nsuch as a country, may generate headlines or a sense of satisfaction, but does little to further either tactical or\neven strategic planning against a given adversary.\n\nEssentially, General Attribution represents a minimally-enriched “best guess” half-way mark toward more robust\n“who-based” Primary Attribution. Such statements may be supportable and defensible given evidence (e.g.,\nactivity identified is ultimately linked to a given state), but the utility of doing so is debatable while the scope for\nmisinterpretation or assumption is concerningly high. While General Attribution statements are accessible to\nmost analysts and organizations, their value, as will be demonstrated in greater detail below, is questionable for\nall parties with an interest in CTI attributive statements.\n\n# Attribution Action Constraints\n\nAttributive actions, although representing some degree of choice on the analyst’s part, also reflect degrees of\n_constraint. Particularly, an analyst may wish to perform Primary Attribution, yet only possess technical evidence of_\nthe activity in question. In this case, irrespective of analyst desire, constraints should compel the analyst to focus\non Behavioral Attribution. Yet the danger inherent to this situation is a migration to General Attribution as a\n“good enough” substitute for the rigors of Primary Attribution statements.\n\nCTI analysts and vendors frequently demonstrate a mismatch between choice and constraints along the\nlimitations described above. Most often, we observe this disconnect where analysts desire greater “who-centric”\nattribution than evidence permits, searching for a way to make statements such as “This organization is\nresponsible for the campaign.” Less frequently, analysts possessing significant additional knowledge beyond mere\ntechnical observables may omit these items (or the conclusions that can be derived from them), typically to\npreserve sources and methods of collection for such evidence which are often sensitive in nature.\n\nIn the latter case, the broader community is left wanting for more information and detail where such items are\nactually available. While not necessarily desirable, such an action does not impose any significant cost or lead to\npotentially incorrect analysis or misconceptions, at least from a pure network defense perspective. Such concerns\nare, however, inherent to the former, when analysts wish to move beyond constraints to make pseudo-Primary\nAttribution claims when necessary evidence is lacking. In these cases, a desire to move beyond the evidence\navailable, either through hypothesis or outright guesswork, can lead to outcomes that are indefensible and\noutright incorrect. Examples would include misattributing identified behaviors to a definite entity, or somewhat\nless concerningly making such claims (which may nonetheless appear likely) when the evidence simply doesn’t\nexist to support.\n\nThat constraints exist on reporting ability and potential accuracy is undeniable, yet overcoming such constraints\nraises several questions. Items include:\n\n10\n“Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks” - Jason Healey, The Atlantic Council\n[(https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/022212_ACUS_NatlResponsibilityCyber.PDF)](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/022212_ACUS_NatlResponsibilityCyber.PDF)\n\n\n-----\n\n    - How can we move beyond evidence constraints on attribution?\n\n    - How can analysts properly describe activity when constraints limit us to technical details?\n\n    - Is it even desirable for analysts to push against evidentiary constraints toward more robust, “who-centric”\nforms of attribution (the right side of the continuum)?\n\nMoving beyond constraints is easily satisfied: analysts simply require more (and better) evidence. Yet the type of\nevidence necessary is often beyond the reach of private sector CTI operations and usually cannot be distributed\nor referenced in public reporting from government or law enforcement operations except in anomalous\nsituations. The type of evidence in question relates to “who-specific” findings typically associated with\ngovernment-run intelligence collection or law enforcement investigations. At times, private sector entities and\nindependent researchers can utilize this information when it is made public, and even more exceptionally uncover\nsuch evidence independently. Especially valuable over the past few years are detailed indictments produced by\nthe United States Department of Justice (DoJ). DoJ indictments are typically treasure troves of information that\nsimply cannot be found elsewhere or through other (legal) means, including details such as organizational\nhierarchies and even the identification of specific individuals involved in operations. In these cases, third-party\nanalysts can leverage this work and, through connection with known technical observables, make links between\ninformation in indictments and previously-gathered technical evidence to make statements closer (although not\nnecessarily identical) to Primary Attribution.\n\nWhen the evidence is simply not available to move beyond constraints, such limitations must be recognized and\nembraced. In these situations, analysts face the frustrating—but necessary—task of grouping observations purely\nbased on technical observations. Multiple frameworks exist to either assist such activity, such as MITRE ATT&CK,\n\n11 or outright define the process, like the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis.12 In any event, analysts must\n\nremain faithful to the information available (technical observations) and not work to move beyond what such\nevidence can support. This essentially means dwelling on the left side of the continuum, focusing on Behavioral\nAttribution, linking observations to named clusters of activity as opposed to discrete entities or personas.\n\nYet in cases where evidence falls short, but desire (or necessity) requires pushing further to the right on the\nattribution continuum toward Primary Attribution, what avenues are available? Some may argue that going “just\nfar enough” towards “who-centric” attribution to identify a plausible sponsor or directing state authority, even if\nthis falls well short of a specific identity, may suffice to add value. In this scenario, where available information is\ninsufficient to make a Primary Attribution statement such as “Sandworm, identified as Russian GRU Unit 74455,”\n\n13 simply saying “Russian-related” or “likely of Russian origin” would appear to be acceptable. This type of General\n\nAttribution, linking to a very broad entity (which consists of multiple subgroups and interests which may not all\nwork in concert with one another), seems enticing at first as a “halfway” point between Behavioral Attribution\n\n11\n[MITRE ATT&CK (https://attack.mitre.org/)](https://attack.mitre.org/)\n\n12\n“The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis” - Sergio Caltagirone, Andrew Pendergast & Christopher Betz\n[(https://www.activeresponse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/diamond.pdf)](https://www.activeresponse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/diamond.pdf)\n\n13 [Sandworm - MITRE ATT&CK (https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034/); “Six Russian GRU Officers Charged in Connection](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034/)\nwith Worldwide Deployment of Destructive Malware and Other Disruptive Actions in Cyberspace” - United States\nDepartment of Justice (DoJ)\n[(https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/six-russian-gru-offcers-charged-connection-worldwide-deployment-destructive-malware-i](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/six-russian-gru-officers-charged-connection-worldwide-deployment-destructive-malware-and)\n[and)](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/six-russian-gru-officers-charged-connection-worldwide-deployment-destructive-malware-and)\n\n\n-----\n\nand incredibly difficult Primary Attribution. But on further analysis, this concept seems to create far more issues\nthan it solves.\n\n# The “Mushy Middle” of Attribution\n\nExtremes of attribution activity—behavior-only clustering and externally-enriched Primary Attribution of threat\nactors— have been established and explored thus far. While there remains significant left- and right-tail space for\nitems that move slightly beyond Behavioral Attribution with additional evidence and items which may fall short of\ncomplete Primary Attribution, a significant space exists between the two. In a previous section, we described this\nas General Attribution—although here we will refer to this area primarily as the “mushy middle.”\n\nThe “mushy middle” consists of attribution statements which go far enough to name a general party—”China”,\n“Romanian criminal gangs”, “Iranian interests”—but that do not go further to concrete entities within these\nbroader groupings. On the one hand, narrowing down activity from the universe of “all possible actors” to a\nsubset such as “Chinese-related threat actors” seems to be somewhat beneficial. Yet any such benefit derives\nfrom a (mis)conception of country-level unitary actions with respect to cyber operations, their objectives, and\ndesired impacts.\n\nFurther examination and reflection reveals that general groupings—whether “Chinese interests” or “Bulgarian\ncriminal elements”—mask a diverse set of actors with varying motivations, TTPs, and intentions. Lazily lumping\nactivity under such a general label may seem productive at first, but under additional scrutiny such actions are\nlikely to facilitate bias or assumption rather than lead to greater analytical rigor and improved defensive\nresponse. To further explore the “mushy middle” and its implications, we will consider several examples.\n\n## Reviewing Russian-Related Intrusion Operations and SUNBURST\n\nSeveral high-profile incidents and resulting statements and analysis from multiple parties highlight a number of\nworrying cyber operations linked to various Russian entities. As part of this, statements ranging from specific\nidentification of Russian government entities (and even the personnel staffing such agencies) exist, along with\nmore general claims of links to Russian-related “interests.” While saying “Russian-related” for a given\nincident—such as the recently disclosed SUNBURST activity —may appear on its face somewhat beneficial, this14\n\n14\n“Continuous Eruption: Further Analysis of the SolarWinds Supply Chain Incident” - Joe Slowik, DomainTools\n[(https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/continuous-eruption-further-analysis-of-the-solarwinds-supply-incident);](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/continuous-eruption-further-analysis-of-the-solarwinds-supply-incident)\n“Highly Evasive Attacker Leverages SolarWinds Supply Chain to Compromise Multiple Global Victims With SUNBURST\nBackdoor” - FireEye\n\n\n-----\n\nclassification papers over significant differences in Russian-nexus cyber operations.

While\n\nGRU operations—especially those linked to Sandworm, or Unit 74455—are frequently linked to disruptive or\noutright destructive operations, no such parallel exists with historical SVR-linked activity. Instead, SVR-linked\noperations (commonly tracked as APT29 or Cozy Bear, although additional subgroups likely exist)\noverwhelmingly focus on traditional espionage activities with no evidence of disruptive activity.\n\nIn this example, an attribution statement going just far enough to say “Russia” is not only unhelpful, but potentially\nmisleading given the differing operational profiles, intentions, and histories of specific Russian-linked threat\nactors. A General Attribution statement related to SUNBURST operations thus seems less than ideal, and\n\n19\n“Russian Government Hackers are Behind a Broad Espionage Campaign that has Compromised U.S. Agencies including\nTreasury and Commerce” - Ellen Nakashima &Craig Timberg, The Washington Post\n[(https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russian-government-spies-are-behind-a-broad-hacking-campaign-that](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russian-government-spies-are-behind-a-broad-hacking-campaign-that-has-breached-us-agencies-and-a-top-cyber-firm/2020/12/13/d5a53b88-3d7d-11eb-9453-fc36ba051781_story.html)\n[-has-breached-us-agencies-and-a-top-cyber-frm/2020/12/13/d5a53b88-3d7d-11eb-9453-fc36ba051781_story.htmli](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russian-government-spies-are-behind-a-broad-hacking-campaign-that-has-breached-us-agencies-and-a-top-cyber-firm/2020/12/13/d5a53b88-3d7d-11eb-9453-fc36ba051781_story.html) );\n“How the Russian hacking group Cozy Bear, suspected in the SolarWinds breach, plays the long game” - Shannon Vavra & Tim\n[Starks, Cyberscoop (https://www.cyberscoop.com/cozy-bear-apt29-solarwinds-russia-persistent/); “The Devil’s in the](https://www.cyberscoop.com/cozy-bear-apt29-solarwinds-russia-persistent/)\nDetails: SUNBURST Attribution” - Joe Slowik, DomainTools\n[(https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/the-devils-in-the-details-sunburst-attribution)](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/the-devils-in-the-details-sunburst-attribution)\n\n20 [“Russian Cyber Units” - Congressional Research Service (https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11718)](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11718)\n\n\n-----\n\nperhaps creates more confusion absent additional evidence allowing for a Primary Attribution statement linking\nthe activity to a specific entity under Russian command authority.\n\nDifferentiation among actors, taking into consideration their different goals, interests, and likely intentions, is\ntherefore critical in properly dispositioning the SUNBURST and related activity.

While derived via Behavioral Attribution, Microsoft’s\noriginal public blog also noted that HAFNIUM is “assessed to be state-sponsored and operating out of China,” a\nGeneral Attribution statement.[22]\n\n21\n“HAFNIUM targeting Exchange Servers with 0-day exploits” - Microsoft\n[(https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/); “Microsoft Exchange Server](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/)\nRemote Code Execution Vulnerability” - Microsoft Security Response Center\n[(https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26855); “ProxyLogon” - OrangeTsai/Cheng-Da Tsai](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26855)\n[(https://proxylogon.com/); “Operation Exchange Marauder: Active Exploitation of Multiple Zero-Day Microsoft Exchange](https://proxylogon.com/)\nVulnerabilities” - Josh Grunzweig, Matthew Meltzer, Sean Koessel, Steven Adair & Thomas Lancaster, Volexity\n[(https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/03/02/active-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities/)](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/03/02/active-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities/)\n\n22 “Examining Exchange Exploitation and its Lessons for Defenders” - Joe Slowik, DomainTools\n[(https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/examining-exchange-exploitation-and-its-lessons-for-defenders)](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/examining-exchange-exploitation-and-its-lessons-for-defenders)\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on reporting from Microsoft, Volexity, and FireEye, threat actors were exploiting CVE-2021-26855 since\nat least January 2021, and given other timelines potentially as far back as November 2020.23 After disclosure,\n\nexploitation activity exploded with various media outlets reporting 20-30,000 entities victimized in the U.S. alone\nwithin days of public vulnerability disclosure.24 Most significantly, several additional, distinct entities beyond\n\nHAFNIUM started abusing this vulnerability—shortly after public disclosure and in several cases just prior.[25]\n\nWhile non-Microsoft reporting emphasized multiple distinct groups exploiting the Exchange vulnerability from\nthe start media reporting and popular conceptions latched onto the initial General Attribution statement from\nMicrosoft: that CVE-2021-26855 and related Microsoft Exchange exploitation is correlated with HAFNIUM,\nHAFNIUM is linked to China, and therefore all such activity is linked to Chinese operations.\n\nThere are several problems with the logic in the previous statement. First, and as demonstrated in reporting from\nFireEye and Volexity, it was already debatable as to whether exploitation from January 2021 onward is linked to a\nsingle entity. Following public disclosure (and the ability to reverse engineer the Exchange patches), exploitation\npossibilities rapidly expand as the vulnerability shifts from a “Zero Day” to a “N-Day.”26 Although evidence is\n\nuncertain as of this writing, available information suggests that one to six distinct groups were exploiting the\nProxyLogon vulnerability prior to public disclosure, with multiple potential additional entities opportunistically\n\n23\n“Detection and Response to Exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Zero-Day Vulnerabilities” - Matt Bromiley, Chris DiGiamo,\nAndrew Thompson & Robert Wallace, FireEye\n[(https://www.freeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/03/detection-response-to-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-di](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/03/detection-response-to-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities.html)\n[ay-vulnerabilities.html); “Examining Exchange Exploitation and its Lessons for Defenders” - Joe Slowik, DomainTools](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/03/detection-response-to-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities.html)\n[(https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/examining-exchange-exploitation-and-its-lessons-for-defenders)](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/examining-exchange-exploitation-and-its-lessons-for-defenders)\n\n24 “More than 20,000 U.S. organizations compromised through Microsoft flaw” - Joseph Menn, Raphael Satter & Trevor\nHunnicutt, Reuters\n[(https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-cyber-microsoft/as-microsoft-email-software-hack-spreads-experts-brace-for-mo](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-cyber-microsoft/as-microsoft-email-software-hack-spreads-experts-brace-for-more-impact-idUKKCN2AX23L)\n[re-impact-idUKKCN2AX23L);](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-cyber-microsoft/as-microsoft-email-software-hack-spreads-experts-brace-for-more-impact-idUKKCN2AX23L)\n\n25 “Four new hacking groups have joined an ongoing offensive against Microsoft’s email servers” - Patrick Howell O’Neill, MIT\nTechnology Review\n[(https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/06/1020442/four-new-hacking-groups-microsoft-email-servers/)](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/06/1020442/four-new-hacking-groups-microsoft-email-servers/)\n\n26 “The Overlooked Problem of 'N-Day' Vulnerabilities” - Ang Cui, DarkReading\n[(https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/the-overlooked-problem-of-n-day-vulnerabilities/a/d-id/1331348)](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/the-overlooked-problem-of-n-day-vulnerabilities/a/d-id/1331348)\n\n\n-----\n\ndoing so after the patch release and vulnerability identification.27 Even in cases where use of the chained\n\nexploitation of the set of Exchange vulnerabilities first linked to HAFNIUM results in the deployment of the same\ntoolset (such as the widely available China Chopper webshell), diversity in precise tool configuration and other\ndetails strongly indicates multiple, distinct entities are engaged in the underlying activity.[28]\n\nSecond, the association of HAFNIUM with “China” raises concerns. HAFNIUM may very well be associated with\nChinese authorities or interests, but such a high-level association (to “China” as opposed to anything specific\nabout the People’s Republic and its various military, intelligence, contracting, and criminal entities) does little to\nassist defense, response, or even higher-level strategy. As stated previously, postulating “China” as a unitary\nobject—with uniform behaviors and intentions in cyber operations—simply ignores the reality of diverse entities\nexecuting cyber intrusions with ties to Chinese authorities.\n\n27\nO’Neill\n\n28\n“Analyzing Attacks Against Microsoft Exchange Server With China Chopper Webshells” - Jeff White, Palo Alto Networks\n[(https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/china-chopper-webshell/); “China Chopper Still Active 9 Years Later” - Paul](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/china-chopper-webshell/)\nRascagneres & Vanja Svajcer, Cisco Talos\n[(https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/08/china-chopper-still-active-9-years-later.html)](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/08/china-chopper-still-active-9-years-later.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nSince Chinese authorities established the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Strategic Support Force (SSF) in\nDecember 2015,29 Chinese-associated cyber activities increasingly bifurcate between traditional espionage\n\noperations and military cyber operations focused technical intelligence along with offensive and defensive\nactions. Typical views of China-linked cyber operations focus on extensive intellectual property theft and\nespionage activity. The formation of the SSF, and its Network Systems Department (NSD) component, combined\nformer military espionage operations (PLA Third Department) and offensive cyber missions (PLA Fourth\nDepartment) into a single entity focused on military specific missions and support. Meanwhile, increased diversity\nof operations by the Chinese civilian Ministry of State Security (MSS) indicates a possible separation of duties in\noverall espionage operations between SSF/NSD and MSS from the mid-2010s onward. While the SSF/NSD\nappears to largely concentrate on military-supporting capabilities in cyber offense and defense, MSS (and its\nvarious contractors and regional units) remain focused on espionage and technology theft operations.30 Although\n\nexceptions certainly exist,31 the overall trajectory of Chinese state computer network operations activity since\n\nthe SSF’s formation reflects an increasingly firm separation of duties between military and civilian intelligence\nauthorities.\n\nFurthermore, in addition to the SSF-MSS bifurcation, a thriving contractor-based, “hack-for-hire” ecosystem also\nexists within China. Most clearly demonstrated through the confusing cluster of activity referred to as “Winnti,”[32]\n\na complex system of relationships exists between actual operating entities and sponsors or directing authorities.\nSuch tangled links have confounded multiple researchers and analysts, leading to a confusing mess of activity\nclusters and incomplete attribution. HAFNIUM may fall into this category, making assessment of this group’s\nintentions, motivations, and operational direction more confusing still.\n\n29\n“The Strategic Support Force and the Future of Chinese Information Operations” - Elsa B.

Yet the diversity of Chinese strategic interests and possible operational\ngoals—including the possibility of building up deniable proxy infrastructure through which to conduct future\noperations, including offensive actions—means that all assumptions of potential Exchange exploitation purpose\nsimply based on a link to “China” are either insupportable or meaningless given numerous plausible options.\nFurthermore, that post-disclosure opportunistic exploitation of the vulnerabilities in Exchange are now lumped\ninto unitary activity by a single agent engenders additional problems. Given information available at the time of\nthis writing, the Behavioral Attribution statements made by Microsoft, FireEye, and others seem defensible and\ndesirable, while subsequent General Attribution statements by Microsoft and popular media generate little more\nthan confusion with respect to this activity.\n\n## The Multitude of Possible Midpoint Errors\n\nThe two examples provided—linked to Russian and Chinese cyber operations, respectively—may appear to limit\nthis discussion to large, complex, and well-resourced cyber powers. And yet with minimal investigation, similar\nconcerns arise in other areas as well. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), Iran, and even the\nUnited States (and other members of the Five Eyes (FVEY) SIGINT-sharing partnership)33 do not represent\n\nmonolithic entities with complete unification over cyber capabilities, missions, and objectives. Rather, these\nentities represent complex arrangements with multiple units performing missions ranging from traditional\nespionage collection to internal security operations to pre-positioning for future conflict (commonly referred to\nas “operational preparation of the environment,” or OPE).[34]\n\nSimply saying that a given activity is the act or aligns with the interest of a given country or authority leaves so\nmuch space for inferring actual intentionality as to be meaningless at best, or misleading at worst. Although\nseemingly not as complex, the interaction and overlap between criminal organizations and entities operating in\nthe e-crime ecosystem is not far off from the complexity of state services.35 In these spaces, as seen in the\n\nexplosion of actors and service providers facilitating ransomware since at least 2018, an entire ecosystem\nspanning initial access, subsequent penetration, and ultimate network ransom operations exists.36 Thus, making\n\ngeneral claims about regions or similar does little to shed light on the specifics of adversary operations given the\ndiversity of actors across multiple geographies operating within this space.\n\n33\n“This Week in DIA History: Formation of the FVEY Partnership” - US Defense Intelligence Agency\n[(https://www.dia.mil/News/Articles/Article-View/Article/1861392/this-week-in-dia-history-formation-of-the-fvey-partners](https://www.dia.mil/News/Articles/Article-View/Article/1861392/this-week-in-dia-history-formation-of-the-fvey-partnership/)\n[hip/)](https://www.dia.mil/News/Articles/Article-View/Article/1861392/this-week-in-dia-history-formation-of-the-fvey-partnership/)\n\n34 “Tactical Cyber: Building a Strategy for Cyber Support to Corps and Below” - Isaac R.

At the same time, General Attribution\ndoes little to actually elucidate specific motivations and intentions for the matter at hand. As a result, General\nAttribution statements represent so much “junk food” for analysts and external observers, providing some\nabstracted glimpse of “who” might be responsible for a given activity while lacking the rigor or specificity required\nfor either network defense or strategic planning and response.\n\n# Orienting Cyber Threat Intelligence to Defensible Attribution Actions\n\nIf CTI attribution remains locked between separate “poles” of Behavioral Attribution and Primary Attribution,\nwith limited ability to migrate from behaviors to specific entities and a likely misleading middle lying in between,\nwhat should be the goal of CTI attributive statements? Put exceptionally simply, the goal of attribution within the\nconcepts of operational cyber security is quite succinct: attributive statements should seek to assist network\ndefenders. In this fashion, the “mushy middle” described above fails to reach the necessary evidentiary rigor of\nPrimary Attribution while muddying Behavioral Attribution by tapping into preconceived notions or artificial\nexpectations of state- or group-level conduct as though these were always monolithic, unitary objects.\n\nThe above is not to say that Primary Attribution statements are useless for network defenders. They can in fact\nbe quite valuable to the degree that such statements enable direct links to real entities from which we can then\nreasonably infer intention and purpose. Identification to this level of specificity can cement understanding of\nadversary behaviors and TTPs, while also facilitating understanding of intruder or attacker goals. When\nperformed properly and accurately, such identification can be invaluable for defensive response and triage. For\nexample, being able to differentiate between a likely espionage campaign and a potentially disruptive operation\nwould be invaluable for response actions to a given breach, as discussed in the SUNBURST example above.\n\nYet while desirable, the likelihood that such information will be available (given evidence requirements),\nactionable (due to possible controls over the use and dissemination of information), or timely (since gathering\nPrimary Attribution evidence takes time) will often be incredibly low. Certainly attribution to specific entities\n(and motivations) is valuable when it can take place, but as evidenced by the months or years-long separation\nbetween public statements and actual events in U.S. indictments or the sanctions and public reports of other\ncountries, the likelihood of such information being timely and actionable is quite small.\n\n\n-----\n\nInstead, by remaining within existing and supportable evidentiary boundaries, CTI analysts can ensure attribution\nclaims remain grounded in available data while still providing critical support to network defenders and related\nparties. Such discipline allows CTI reporting to detail how intrusions take place, even if why and by whom remain\nmysteries. Furthermore, CTI analysts will also avoid generic, largely unhelpful statements such as “this appears to\nalign with Russian intentions” that provide no appreciable value for defensive operations and may ultimately lead\nto misconceptions and ill-thought assumptions instead given the diversity of such interests.\n\nWhile the “mushy middle” may succeed in claiming soundbites, conference presentations, and media mentions,\nthis arena fails to provide much in the way of actionable, useful information for network defenders. Relation to a\ngeneral “interest” or abstract “intention” simply does not provide enough fidelity into adversary motivation and\nobjectives to engender improved defensive responses. Instead, such an approach generates a superficial feeling of\n“adversary identification” when such identification resembles little more than the toss of a weighted die.\n\nFurthermore, General Attribution provides little for audiences typically more interested in Primary Attribution\nstatements, such as policymakers and strategic decision makers. For their actions to truly matter, just pointing a\nfinger at “China” or similar does little more than provide a performative statement—actual, concrete action\ndemands narrowing down responsible entities to specific parties. In this way, responses ranging from sanctions to\nindictments to possible cyber “counterstrikes” are enabled.37 Failure to provide sufficient detail on such matters\n\nto this type of audience therefore does little to enable any impactful or effective action in the realm of cyber\noperations, deterrence, or response. While “who” can and, depending on the audience, certainly does matter in\ncyber defensive operations, the evidentiary standard of reaching “who-based” attribution is well beyond that\nwhich is expressed by many entities operating in the public sphere.\n\nGiven the above arguments. General Attribution represents a lazy midpoint between grounded Behavioral\nAttribution and more robust (but rarely achieved, and if so even more rarely made public) Primary Attribution\nactivities. General Attribution statements are certainly possible, and potentially (if vacuously) supportable to\nsome degree. Yet given the evidence available to many CTI analysts, the combination of assumptions made in\nperforming General Attribution combined with lack of any noticeable, material value make this an undesirable,\npointless endeavor. Where analysts can proceed toward more robust attribution statements defining specific\n\n37\n“U.S. Cyber Command operation disrupted Internet access of Russian troll factory on day of 2018 midterms” - Ellen\nNakashima, The Washington Post\n[(https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-cyber-command-operation-disrupted-internet-access-of-russi](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-cyber-command-operation-disrupted-internet-access-of-russian-troll-factory-on-day-of-2018-midterms/2019/02/26/1827fc9e-36d6-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html)\n[an-troll-factory-on-day-of-2018-midterms/2019/02/26/1827fc9e-36d6-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-cyber-command-operation-disrupted-internet-access-of-russian-troll-factory-on-day-of-2018-midterms/2019/02/26/1827fc9e-36d6-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html)\n\n\n-----\n\ngroups, organizations, or persons, we should use all tools and evidence in our power to do so. But given the rare\nsituations where this can be achieved, CTI analysts and commercial vendors are advised to remain firmly\ngrounded in making Behavioral Attribution claims which are supported by evidence, which also happen to be the\nstatements of most immediate utility to on-the-ground network defenders.\n\n# A Note on Names\n\nOne final consideration relates to naming linked to CTI attributive actions.38 Analysts and external observers are\n\nfamiliar with a diverse series of names from various vendors, organizations, and other parties describing what\nseems, on its face, to be identical (or at least overlapping) activity. One typical and convincing argument\nconcerning the profusion of threat actor names, including when referring to the same activity, is that analysts\nshould avoid using the terminology of others due to different sources, clustering methodologies, and visibility.[39]\n\nThis approach makes sense and ties in to the epistemic realities of typical analyst visibility and available evidence.\nYet as noted in prior sections, this activity aligns with a certain sector of our attribution continuum, namely\nBehavioral Attribution based on clustering of observables.\n\nAs illustrated below, unless an analyst finds themselves in the improbable position of omniscience with respect to\nthe set of all possible observations of a given threat, campaign, or other action, at best analysts will work with a\nsubset of observations. Furthermore, different analysts, utilizing different sources or possessing different\nvisibility into matters, will have perspectives on matters that, although frequently overlapping, are not necessarily\nexact—and this is before we delve in to matters of methodology which may result in different clustering actions.\nIn this case, unless third parties have visibility into both the methodology and corpus of evidence used to derive a\ncluster name, Behavioral Attribution terms should be distinct among different analysts.\n\nMatters change when we proceed along the attribution continuum towards Primary Attribution. In this situation,\nnames are not linked to varying clusters of related observations, but instead designate a specific entity,\norganization, or person in the world. In these cases, a profusion of names for precisely the same thing is both\n\n38\n“The Newcomer’s Guide to Cyber Threat Actor Naming” - Florian Roth\n[(https://cyb3rops.medium.com/the-newcomers-guide-to-cyber-threat-actor-naming-7428e18ee263)](https://cyb3rops.medium.com/the-newcomers-guide-to-cyber-threat-actor-naming-7428e18ee263)\n\n39 “Making Order out of Chaos: How to Deal with Threat Group Names” - Katie Nickels, SANS\n[(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff1yhdIx0yY)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff1yhdIx0yY)\n\n\n-----\n\nunhelpful and absurd. As previously documented, CTI analysts will rarely be able to migrate toward Primary\nAttribution statements, and halfway General Attribution claims are similarly unhelpful as well as imprecise.\nTherefore the issue of name profusion for specific, existing entities is not common—but it does occur.\n\nTo explore further, we can look at the 2018 indictment of two Chinese nationals by the U.S. Department of Justice\nfor intellectual property theft campaigns.40 Prior to the indictment, CTI analysts and vendors tracked the activity\n\nin question under various names such as APT10, Cloud Hopper, POTASSIUM, Stone Panda, and other terms.[41]\n\nWhile such tracking made sense—given different visibility and analytical methodology—prior to the indictment\n(and its treasure trove of Primary Attribution evidence), after its release the activity was linked to a specific\nentity: Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Company, operating on behalf of or in conjunction\nwith the Chinese MSS’s Tianjin State Security Bureau. At this point, the activities tracked as APT10, Stone Panda,\nCloud Hopper, etc., coalesce around a specific entity in the world—and the cryptonyms no longer make sense, at\nleast in the context of activity specifically described in the indictment.\n\nFor describing the campaigns in the 2018 DoJ document, use of the vendor-specific cryptonyms becomes useful\nonly insofar as it allows us to link the Primary Attribution statements within the document to prior analysis when\nsuch evidence was unavailable. A proper way of referencing the activity would therefore resemble something\nalong the lines of, “cyber intrusions executed by Huaying Haitai, previously tracked as APT10,” or similar. But\ncontinuing to use the cryptonyms exclusively without reference to the named, identified responsible party\nmuddies analysis and enables continuous confusion.\n\nWhere matters become less clear are in future research and analysis of activity, similar to previous discussions\nconcerning the “decay” of linked Primary Attribution statements over time. Using the same example as above,\nPrimary Attribution evidence allows for the identification of a specific entity responsible for items previously\ntracked as Cloud Hopper, etc.—but future activity, absent continued collection and availability of Primary\nAttribution evidence, will lack equivalent visibility. In these cases, visibility- and methodology-specific names may\nreemerge as problems of evidence availability and perspective return. However, future statements can at least\nanchor themselves in prior Primary Attribution statements by noting the historical link to a definite entity, and\nthe possibility that future observations reflect a continuation of this link. At this stage, we reach the rightward\nsection of the attribution continuum, but fall short of pure or complete Primary Attribution possibilities. Instead,\nwe can only make assessments of a continued link to the named entity in past Prior Attribution work until\nsufficient evidence becomes available to re-establish the “who”-specific link.\n\n40\n“Two Chinese Hackers Associated With the Ministry of State Security Charged with Global Computer Intrusion Campaigns\nTargeting Intellectual Property and Confidential Business Information” - U.S. Department of Justice\n[(https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusio](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\n[n)](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\n\n41 “Operation Cloud Hopper” - PWC & BAE Systems\n[(https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/cloud-hopper-report-fnal-v4.pdfi](https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/cloud-hopper-report-final-v4.pdf) ); “APT10 (MenuPass Group): New Tools, Global\nCampaign Latest Manifestation of Longstanding Threat” - FireEye\n[(https://www.freeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/apt10_menupass_grou.htmli](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/apt10_menupass_grou.html) ); “Two Birds, One STONE PANDA” -\n[Adam Kozy, CrowdStrike (https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/two-birds-one-stone-panda/)](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/two-birds-one-stone-panda/)\n\n\n-----\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAttribution is a thorny subject in CTI discussion, but through further examination and analysis we can reveal the\nconcept not as a binary choice but rather a selection along a continuum of options. These range from purely\nbehavior-based analysis and linking on technical information to robust, all-source identification of specific\norganizations or even individual persons responsible for a given incident.\n\nAlthough attribution maps to a continuum with a near infinite variety of possibilities, thorough examination of\nattribution outcomes reveals a mushy, undesirable middle ground between the two poles described above. Due to\na variety of factors, many (if not most) CTI analysts and their respective employers will be unable to push very far\nfrom the leftward pole of Behavioral Attribution. Yet in desiring to achieve something more akin to Primary\nAttribution, CTI practitioners must beware a middle ground of General Attribution that provides little real value\nto either network defenders or higher-level policymakers and strategic audiences, while also introducing\nassumptions and overly broad classifications that confuse decision-making and follow-on analysis.\n\nEven though the temptation to CTI analysts is strong to make general associative statements linking a given\nactivity or incident to a country or high-level group, further examination indicates these are at best misleading\nand at worst potentially harmful. Understanding that groups, from state-sponsored cyber operations to complex\ncriminal networks, are not unitary objects but rather contain various interest centers, points of focus, and\noperational teams highlights that simply saying “this incident is related to Country X” does little to advance the\nfield of network defense on any practical level. By understanding the continuum of attribution choices and the\nconstraints forced on these choices through available data and evidence, CTI practitioners can remain grounded\nin what sources are accessible while also improving support to consumers of CTI.\n\n\n-----",
