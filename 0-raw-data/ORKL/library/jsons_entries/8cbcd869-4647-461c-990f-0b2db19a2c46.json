For the first time we were observing what seemed to be a coordinated North Korean\nattack against Russian entities. While attributing attacks to a certain threat group or another\nis problematic, the analysis below reveals intrinsic connections to the tactics, techniques and\ntools used by the North Korean APT group – Lazarus.\n\nThis discovery came about as we were tracking multiple malicious Office documents that\nwere designed and crafted specifically for Russian victims. Upon closer examination of these\ndocuments, we were able to discern that they belonged to the early stages of an infection\nchain which ultimately led to an updated variant of a versatile Lazarus backdoor, dubbed\n[KEYMARBLE by the US-CERT.](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/AR18-221A)\n\nSometimes referred to as Hidden Cobra, Lazarus is one of the most prevalent and active\nAPT groups in the world today. The infamous group, which is known to be a North Korean\nsponsored threat actor, is believed to be behind some of the largest security breaches of the\n\n\n-----\n\nlast decade.\n\n[This includes the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack) [Bangladesh bank heist, and](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/insane-81m-bangladesh-bank-heist-heres-know/)\nnumerous other high stakes operations, such as the theft of millions of dollars worth in\ncryptocurrencies from at least five different [cryptocurrency exchange services worldwide.](https://www.coindesk.com/north-korean-hacking-group-lazarus-stole-571-million-in-cryptos-report)\n\n[While our campaign’s timeline seems to overlap with last week’s ESTsecurity report on the](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2105)\n“Operation Extreme Job” campaign targeting South Korean security companies, we have\nobserved different tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) employed in the two\noperations.\n\nIt is long believed among the security community that Lazarus is divided into at least two\nsubdivisions: the first named Andariel which focuses primarily on attacking the South Korean\ngovernment and organizations, and the second, Bluenoroff, whose main focus is\nmonetization and global espionage campaigns.\n\nThe differences between the two campaigns, which were conducted at the same time,\nprovides wind once again to the theory that multiple divisions are at work here.\n\nThis incident, however, represents an unusual choice of victim by the North Korean threat\nactor. Usually, these attacks reflect the geopolitical tensions between the DPRK and nations\nsuch as the U.S, Japan and South Korea. In this case, though, it is probably Russian\norganizations who are the targets.\n\n**Infection Chain**\n\nDuring our analysis we encountered two different infection flows.\n\nThe main infection flow consists of the following three main steps:\n\n1. A ZIP file which contains two documents: a benign decoy PDF document and a\n\nmalicious Word document with macros.\n2. The malicious macro downloads a VBS script from a Dropbox URL, followed by the\n\nVBS script execution.\n3. The VBS script downloads a CAB file from the dropzone sever, extracts the embedded\n\nEXE file (backdoor) using Windows’ “expand.exe” utility, and finally executes it.\n\nAt first, the infection chain consisted of all the above stages, but at a certain point, the\nattackers decided to skip on the second stage of the infection chain and the malicious Word\nmacros were modified to directly “download and execute” the Lazarus Backdoor in stage\nthree.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig 1: The Infection Flow**\n\n**Lure Office Documents**\n\nAll documents related to this campaign were uploaded to VirusTotal from different sources in\nRussia during the week of 26-31/01/19, with what looks like their original file names.\n\nAll the documents also included similar metadata, with “home” as the author name, and a\nKorean code page.\n\nDuring the campaign, the attackers utilized multiple lure images in order to convince the\nvictims to click the “Enable Content” button and trigger the malicious macro code.\n\n“2018.11.2~2019.1.26_ErrorDetail.doc”\n\n**First Submission: 2019-01-31 13:45:04**\n\n**Code Page: Korean**\n\n**Author: home**\n\n**Notes: Cyrillic looking characters in the image**\n\n**SHA-1: 088c6157d2bb4238f92ef6818b9b1ffe44109347**\n\n\n-----\n\n**“Serial_Numbers.xls”**\n\n**First Submission: 2019-01-31 06:56:00**\n\n**Code Page: Korean**\n\n**Author: home**\n\n**SHA-1: 4cd5a4782dbed5b8e337ee402f1ef748b5035709**\n\n\n-----\n\n**“LosAngeles_Court_report.doc”**\n\n**First Submission: 2019-01-26 09:59:50**\n\n**Code Page: Korean**\n\n**Author: home**\n\n**SHA-1: e89458183cb855118539373177c6737f80e6ba3f**\n\n**Malicious Macros**\n\nThe campaign exhibits very similar macro code in both the XLS and DOC variants of the\ndropper.\n\nThe macros themselves are very simple and straightforward, but in this case, keeping the\nmacros simple and without any advanced obfuscation tricks, resulted in malicious documents\nthat were able to pass undetected by many reputable security vendors on Virus Total.\n\nAn interesting part of the download stage in one of the documents, is the unexplained usage\nof a Dropbox “Host” field in the HTTP request header.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig 2: A dropbox “Host” field in the HTTP request header**\n\nThe mystery was solved, however, once we located another related sample, which actually\ndownloaded the next stage of the infection chain from Dropbox itself, making it pretty clear\nthat Dropbox was the original source for the second stage of the infection, during this\ncampaign.\n\n**Fig 3: The code responsible for downloading the second stage of the infection from DropBox**\n\n**Decoy Document**\n\nDuring this campaign, at least one of the malicious Office documents was originally\ndistributed via a ZIP file, along with another PDF decoy document named NDA_USA.pdf.\n\n**Fig 4: The decoy and malicious files contained within the distributed ZIP file**\n\nThe benign document tries to make the files look legitimate, and contains an NDA for\nStarForce technologies – a Russian based company which provides software copyprotection solutions.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fig 5: The benign document sent to decoy victims**\n\n**The Dropzone**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Lazarus Group is known to utilize an array of compromised servers for its operations,\nand this time is no different.\n\nThe final payload in this campaign is downloaded from a compromised server in the form of\na CAB file, which is later expanded into the KEYMARBLE backdoor. It is important to note\nthe CAB file is disguised as a JPEG image on the compromised host\n(https://37.238.135[.]70/img/anan.jpg).\n\nA closer look at the compromised server shows an unconvincing website for the “Information\nDepartment” of the “South Oil Company”. The server is located in Iraq and hosted by\nEarthLink Ltd. Communications&Internet Services.\n\nFig 6: The Iraqi compromised server\n\n**The KEYMARBLE Backdoor**\n\n[KEYMARBLE is as a general purpose backdoor that was described in a report by NCCIC](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/AR18-221A)\nlast August. The malware is a remote administration tool (RAT) that provides its operators\nwith basic functionality to retrieve information from the victim’s machine. Once executed, it\nconducts several initializations, contacts a C&C server and waits indefinitely for new\n\n\n-----\n\ncommands from it. Each received command is processed by the backdoor and handled\nwithin an appropriate function, which in turn collects a piece of information or conducts an\naction on the target machine.\n\n**AV Detection**\n\nAs part of the infection flow we previously described, all of the malicious documents\nmentioned downloaded KEYMARBLE, compressed inside a CAB file.\n\nIt is interesting to note, that by encapsulating the backdoor in a CAB file, the attackers were\nable to lower the detection rate of this sample from five vendors to a mere two vendors, who\ndetected this file as malicious on VirusTotal:\n\n**Fig 7: vendor detection results in Virus Total**\n\n**Version Comparison**\n\nThis instance of the malware resembles its predecessor from last year in flow and\nfunctionality. Both operate in two main stages – an initialization phase that sets up necessary\ndata structures and contacts the C&C server, and the main command dispatch loop that\nreceives commands from the server and passes them on to their corresponding handlers.\nParticular mechanisms within these stages also appear in other pieces of malware that\noriginate from North Korea, a lot of which are attributed to the infamous Lazarus Group.\n\n\n-----\n\nHaving said that, there are particular differences in this variant from the previously reported\nsample of the same family. For one, the authors used [wolfSSL, an open source code](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl)\nrepository used to authenticate the client’s identity to the C2 server and encrypt\ncommunication. This is not the first time this library is used in North Korean malware. Intezer\n[described a different RAT that leveraged it in an attack against cryptocurrency exchanges](https://www.intezer.com/lazarus-group-targets-more-cryptocurrency-exchanges-and-fintech-companies/)\nlast year. Additionally, while most of the command codes handled by the backdoor overlap in\nboth the new and old version, some of the codes were omitted from the recent sample and\nseveral others were modified, so as the functionality of their handlers.\n\nIn the upcoming paragraphs we will outline the key features of KEYMARBLE, focusing on\nboth correlations and distinctions from the previous sample reported by the US-CERT.\n\n**Initialization**\n\nBoth backdoor variants start with an action of dynamic Win32 API functions resolution. This\nis a very typical initial stage that appears across multiple North Korean malwares, whereby a\nlist of function names is decrypted during runtime and then resolved to a global table in\nmemory. The addresses from that table will be used subsequently to invoke any calls to the\ndesired API functions. One of the features in this mechanism that distinguishes this malware\n[family from others is perhaps the usage of the open source McbDES2 code to implement](https://read.pudn.com/downloads198/sourcecode/crypt/ca/930917/McbDES2.hpp__.htm)\nfunction name decryption with the DES algorithm.\n\n**Figure 8: Comparison of API resolution logic in both versions of KEYMARBLE**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 9: API function name decryption using the open source McbDoDES template library**\n\nFollowing this, KEYMARBLE will start preparing the data structures required for\ncommunicating with the C&C server. This will include both initiation of WolfSSL related\nstructures as well as initial contact with the server. For the former, the malware will drop a\nhardcoded PEM certificate to the disk under %TEMP% with the file name “Thumbss.db”,\nwhich will have its data read and passed to an internal WolfSSL function called ProcessFile.\nThis will in turn parse it and assign data derived from the certificate to a global context\nstructure used for communication. The used certificate in this sample can be found in the\nIOC section below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 10: Initialization of communication using wolfSSL, and outline of a proprietary**\nstructure that comprises some of the key structures required for the malware’s\ncommunication.\n\nAs for initiating contact with the C2 server, the malware will create a socket, set it to be nonblocking by invoking ioctlsocket with the command argument set to 0x8004667E, and\nattempt to connect to the hardcoded IP address 194\\.45\\.8\\.41 over port 443. This will\nhappen indefinitely with 30 minute intervals between each connection attempt until success,\nat which point the malware will break from the loop and continue its execution.\n\n**Communication Protocol**\n\nEach message exchanged between the malware and the server will have a predefined\nstructure (as outlined in figure 4) which resembles a TLS application record. As mentioned\nbefore, the malware leverages SSL for communication, hence each such message will be\nencrypted with a key exchanged during the SSL handshake between client and server, and\nthe action of sending or receiving data will be handled by wolfSSL functions designated for\nthis purpose (SendData and ReceiveData accordingly).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 11: Custom protocol message structure. Resembles a TLS record.**\n\nAfter initiating the first connection with the C2 server, KEYMARBLE will issue a beacon\nmessage. This message is meant to carry the machine’s UID, which is a result of the\noperation:\nMD5(ProductID|MAC), where the first field is obtained by querying the\n_SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\ProductId registry key, and the second is_\nthe MAC address obtained by invoking the function GetAdaptersInfo. However, this UID will\nbe retrieved only after an explicit request from the server, and until that’s done the data field\nin the beacon will be left blank.\n\n**Figure 12: calculation of UUID as a result of MD5 on ProductID and MAC address.**\n\nAfter the initial beacon the malware will enter an infinite loop where it will anticipate to get\ncommand codes from the server. These will be passed on to a dispatcher function, where\neach command will be handled by an appropriate handler. The command is received in two\n\n\n-----\n\nparts – first the server will send a message carrying the command s data length, and only\nthen it will issue the actual command code.\n\n**Figure 13: beacon and main message loop**\n\n**Backdoor Commands**\n\nThe command dispatcher is a very basic mechanism that uses a switch case in order to pass\ncontrol to the corresponding function. The command codes range from 0x1234556 to\n0x1234578 and most overlap with commands that appeared in the older version of the\nbackdoor. However, this version carries a smaller number of commands (18 vs. 22) and few\nof them differ in code and functionality from the older version. Also, much like with receiving\nthe command code, each command argument sent (if such is required) will be preceded with\na length message to indicate what buffer size should be allocated for the sent argument.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 14: command dispatch function comparison between the old and new version of**\nKEYMARBLE\n\nAll of the commands, their logic and response are summarized in the table below:\n\n\n**Command**\n**code**\n\n\n**Meaning** **Response data**\n\n\n0x1234556 Receives a message with arbitrary data, ignores it and\njust sends a blank message back. Probably used to test\nthe backdoor.\n\n0x1234558 Receives a path to a directory, enumerates it and builds\nan array of data structures that conveys various\ninformation fields on each file in it (e.g. file size, last\nwrite time etc.). Once all data from the directory is\nretrieved, the array will be sent to the server. See\nappendix for more details.\n\n0x1234559 Receives a command to execute on Windows and runs\nit with the following command line:\n_cmd.exe /c “[received_cmd_line] >_\n_%TEMP%\\PM[GetTempFileNameW_generated_name]”_\n_>2&1. The output of the execution, which will be written_\nto the %TEMP% directory and prefixed with “PM” will\nbe sent in chunks of 16KB to the server. A maximum of\n60 chunks can be sent while the command is still\nexecuting. Subsequently, the generated temporary file\nwe be deleted and the cmd.exe process terminated.\nThe residual data that was not sent yet after termination\nwill be forwarded on to the server.\n\n0x123455A Retrieves information on running processes in the\nsystem, gathers it into a buffer and issues it to the\nserver.\n\n0x123455B Gets a name of a process as an argument and\nterminates it.\n\n0x123455C Receives a file name and number of iterations as an\nargument, overwrites the file’s content, renames and\ndeletes it. The overwrite happens with a stream\ngenerated by the libc rand function (with the current\ntick count as seed), and the new file name is generated\nas a 3-10 character name that is also a result of a\nsimilar stream. The process of data garbling and\nrenaming takes places for the amount of iterations\nspecified by the server, after which the file is deleted.\n\n\nSends a response\nwith the data field se\nto 0.\n\nIf succeeds, respond\nwith the command\ncode after sending a\nthe data, otherwise i\nthe path wasn’t foun\nit will send back a\nmessage with a blan\ndata field.\n\nSends a response\nwith the data field se\nto 0.\n\n–\n\nIf succeeds, respond\nwith the command\ncode.\n\nSends the result of\n_GetLastError as data_\nafter the DeleteFileW\noperation.\n\n\n-----\n\n0x123455D Collects various pieces of information on the system\nand network of the attacked machine (e.g. MAC\naddress, free space on disk, OS build info etc.), builds\nthem into a single buffer and sends it as response. See\nappendix for more details.\n\n0x123455E Scans all drive letters and checks for the existence of\nfixed, non-root or removable drives. For each found\ndrive a buffer is created and initialized with the drive’s\nnumeric type, the drive’s letter and the underlying\nvolume’s name. for the last parameter, if the drive has\nno name and it’s fixed or non-root the name will be\nassigned as “Local Disk”, otherwise if it’s removable it\nwill be assigned as “CD Drive”. All such buffers are\nappended together and sent to the C2..\n\n0x123455F Gets a file path and length of data, after which data is\nsent from the server in chunks of 16KB and written to\nthat path.\n\n0x1234560 Gets a file path and attempts to get a handle to it. If\nsucceeds, retrieves file size and sends the file content\nto the server in chunks of 16KB.\n\n0x1234565 Sends an uninitialized global buffer of size 448 to the\nserver.\n\n0x123456E Sends the current directory (result of\n_GetCurrentDirectoryW) to the server._\n\n0x123456F Receives a directory path as argument and sets it to be\nthe current one (using SetCurrentDirectoryW).\n\n0x1234574 Receives a path to a directory as an argument, iterates\nover all files in it and zips them using the open source\n[TZip library. The archive is located at %TEMP% and its](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~mdfisher/Code/WebPagePreprocessor/zip.cpp)\nname is prefixed with ‘DWS00’. Upon successful zip,\nthe archive will be sent to the server, otherwise any\ncreated file will be deleted.\n\n0x1234575 Receives 2 arguments – an application path and a\nwShowWindow parameter (determines if the process\nwindow is visible or not) and creates a new process for\nit.\n\n\nIf succeeds, respond\nwith the command\ncode after sending t\nbuffer.\n\n–\n\nIf succeeds, respond\nwith the command\ncode, otherwise\nsends back the last\nerror.\n\nIf succeeds, respond\nwith the command\ncode, otherwise\nsends back the last\nerror.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nSends the result of\n_GetCurrentDirectory_\nas a response to the\nserver.\n\nIf succeeds, respond\nwith the command\ncode.\n\nIf succeeds, respond\nwith the command\ncode.\n\n\n-----\n\n0x1234576 Receives 2 paths – a source path and a destination\npath. The malware will move the file from the source to\ndestination path.\n\n0x1234577 Receives 2 file names – a source and destination. The\nmalware will get the file time of the source and set the\ndestination file’s time to be the same.\n\n0x1234578 Retrieves the current file name and sends it to the\nserver.\n\n\nIf succeeds, respond\nwith the command\ncode.\n\nSends the last error\none of the operation\nfails, otherwise send\n0.\n\n–\n\n\nCheck Point protects against this attack through its SandBlast threat prevention solutions.\n\nIOCs\n\n2b4fb64c13c55aa549815ec6b2d066a75ccd248e (New KEYMARBLE sample)\nd1410d073a6df8979712dd1b6122983f66d5bef8 (Old KEYMARBLE sample)\n088c6157d2bb4238f92ef6818b9b1ffe44109347 (Maldoc)\n4cd5a4782dbed5b8e337ee402f1ef748b5035709 (Maldoc)\ne89458183cb855118539373177c6737f80e6ba3f (Maldoc)\na5b2c704c5cff550e6c47454b75393add46f156f (ZIP file containing decoy PDF)\n194\\.45\\.8\\.41:443 (KEYMARBLE C2)\nhxxp://37\\.238\\.135\\.70/img/anan.jpg (Dropzone server)\nPEM Certificate:\n\n—–BEGIN CERTIFICATE—–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\n\n\n-----\n\nTwkCOWQf3m6oX56DDpzeHJmLYEukX7QNjVBF3mTW7LIuPT5rR3nJFYJA9Tf0umvd\nB30JttH5\n—–END CERTIFICATE—–\n\nReferences\n\nNCCIC KEYMARBLE report from August 2018: https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/analysisreports/AR18-221A\nIntezer report on cryptocurrency exchange attacks by Lazarus group from March 2018:\nhttps://www.intezer.com/lazarus-group-targets-more-cryptocurrency-exchanges-andfintech-companies/\n[WolfSSL on Github: https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl)\nMcbDes2 project code:\nhttps://read.pudn.com/downloads198/sourcecode/crypt/ca/930917/McbDES2.hpp__.ht\nm\nTZip library:\n[https://graphics.stanford.edu/~mdfisher/Code/WebPagePreprocessor/zip.cpp](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~mdfisher/Code/WebPagePreprocessor/zip.cpp)\n\nAppendix:\n\nStructure used for each file and directory enumerated during execution of handler for\ncode 0x1234558:\n\nThe buffer used for collection system and network info in the handler for code 0x123455D\nwill have the following outline:\n\n\n-----\n\nwhere info_item is a FAM of the following structure:\n\nand system_info has the following structure:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
