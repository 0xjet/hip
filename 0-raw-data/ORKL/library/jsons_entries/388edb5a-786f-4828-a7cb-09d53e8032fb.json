    "plain_text": "## FLASHPOINT HUNT TEAM:\n# Zeppelin Ransomware Analysis\n\n### Flashpoint’s Hunt Team comprises talented researchers who specialize in identifying, investigating,\n\n and mitigating cyber threats. ​One of the recent examples of work provided by The Hunt Team\n\n analysts was extensive analysis of Zeppelin ransomware. Zeppelin was one of the most\n\n sophisticated and, therefore, expensive ransomware builders put on the underground market. It was\n\n one of the first examples of a sophisticated ransomware builder for sale that did not require\n\n affiliation with the criminal group in order to operate the ransomware. Because of this, it is\n\n impractical to associate “Zeppelin” attacks with any group since their business model essentially\n\n made it a Ransomware-as-a-Franchise.\n\n The following outlines Zeppelin’s origins and a technical analysis from the Flashpoint Hunt Team:\n\n ZEPPELIN ORIGINS:\n\nIt all started on November 5, 2019, when a threat actor posted on top-tier Russian-language hacking forums\n\noffering a new ransomware builder named “Zeppelin.”\n\nImage 1: Original Zeppelin offering for sale\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Zeppelin builder’s notable features included the ability to execute arbitrary commands before starting\n\nthe search, data encryption, and deliberate inability to execute on systems of the countries of the\n\nCommonwealth of Independent States (including Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan). In addition, the\n\nransom note is completely customisable including content, language, and method of contacting the malicious\n\nactor.\n\nFor example this ransom note was written in Turkish and listed the contact address as a Gmail account.\n\nImage 2: Zeppelin ransom note\n\nThe first reports of Zeppelin ransomware infections appeared just a day after the initial offering, targeting\n\ntech and healthcare companies in Europe as well as the United States. Samples were hosted on water-holed\n\nwebsites and in the case of the PowerShell loader, on Pastebin. According to various researchers, at least\n\nsome of the attacks were conducted through managed security service providers (MSSPs).\n\n### TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:\n\nThe distinct feature of the Zeppelin ransomware is that it encrypts files on the victim’s computer with a\n\ncustom extension and always prepends each with the same bytes. Ransomware prepends the hardcoded\n\nmarker string “ZEPPELIN” to the beginning of each encrypted file. This is followed by an 8-byte length of\n\nencrypted data and an 8-byte length of original data, which includes a 3-byte \"666\" string that the\n\nransomware adds to every file before the encryption.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 3: Zeppelin encrypted file with the prepend\n\nFlashpoint analysts were able to uncover key features of the ransomware builder such as it’s position among\n\nthe existing RaaS ecosystem, anti-analysis and anti-execution techniques, geopolitical affiliations, encryption\n\nstandards and unique features allowing for the creation of precise signatures that can be used by intrusion\n\ndetection systems.\n\nAnalysts uncovered that although the Zeppelin ransomware is an enhanced version of “Buran” ransomware\n\nand using the same implementation of RSA + RSA + AES and RNG for encryption and decryption functionality,\n\nthe rest of the build, from functionality to installation mechanisms, is completely different and a stand-alone\n\nproduct.\n\nThe builder executable is able to create any number of 2048-bit RSA keys, which it saves in the “master.key”\n\nfile. The public key from the RSA pair is hard-coded in several executables that are also generated by the\n\nbuilder: the master unlocker executable and the ransomware itself (in EXE, DLL, or PS1 form).\n\nIt is possible to generate numerous keys and therefore create numerous strains of the ransomware, each of\n\nwhich requires its own master unlocker. As an additional level of complexity, the seed that the builder uses\n\nfor key generation is a time stamp counter, which is different for every actor and machine that uses the\n\nbuilder to generate a set of master keys.\n\nFlashpoint analysts confirmed that the master builder that is generated with one set of keys cannot decrypt\n\nfiles that have been encrypted with different sets of master RSA-2048 keys. This feature ensures only the\n\noperator who creates the particular strain of Zeppelin ransomware can subsequently decrypt files encrypted\n\nwith this strain.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 4: Zeppelin builder user interface\n\nIt is not unusual for malware writers to use various obfuscation methods to make executables more difficult\n\nto detect or analyze. Zeppelin Raas creators went a step further and created various methods to thwart not\n\nonly analysis, but also a usage of the ransomware builder by unwanted groups.\n\nBy examining the API calls, Flashpoint analysts were able to view the check that the executable performs to\n\nmake sure the operator of the ransomware is a Russian speaker and/or a citizen of countries of the\n\nCommonwealth of Independent States. The program checks the computer locale, as well as the user’s\n\npreferred and default languages, keyboard layout, and calendar information.\n\n### FINAL THOUGHTS:\n\nZeppelin offering showed that the RaaS made a leap in maturation in the tactics, techniques, and procedures\n\n(TTPs) of threat actors leveraging ransomware—either for more substantial financial gain or as a distraction\n\nfrom other illicit activities which brings ransomware once again to the top of the list of information security\n\nteams.\n\nThis comprehensive approach to the analysis of Zeppelin provided our clients with extensive IOCs related to\n\nthis specific ransomware as well as unique insight into trends of modern ransomware in general. Ultimately,\n\nthis leads the private and public sector to better determine the appropriate alerting capabilities needed and a\n\nthorough threat assessment of this ransomware for potential similar ransomware in the future.\n\n\n-----\n\n### ABOUT FLASHPOINT\n\nFlashpoint is the globally trusted leader in risk intelligence for organizations that demand the fastest, most\ncomprehensive coverage of threatening activity on the internet.
