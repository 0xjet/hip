Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas\n\nGCSB Minister Andrew Little said that the foreign intelligence agency has established links\nbetween Chinese state-sponsored actors known as Advanced Persistent Threat 40 (APT40)\nand malicious cyber activity in New Zealand.\n\nThe GCSB had \"worked through a robust technical attribution process\" to establish its\nconclusions, Little said.\n\nHe said the government is joining other countries in strongly condemning what the Chinese\nMinistry of State Security has been doing both in New Zealand and globally.\n\n\"Separately, the GCSB has also confirmed Chinese state-sponsored actors were responsible\nfor the exploitation of Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities in New Zealand in early 2021.\n\n\"We call for an end to this type of malicious activity, which undermines global stability and\nsecurity, and we urge China to take appropriate action in relation to such activity emanating\nfrom its territory,\" Little said in a statement.\n\nMicrosoft email servers have been targeted and Little said the GCSB has helped the affected\nlocal organisations.\n\nIn March [New Zealanders were warned to be concerned and act swiftly after a massive](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/437849/microsoft-email-users-in-nz-told-to-act-quickly-after-mass-hack)\nemail hack that was blamed on China.\n\n\n-----\n\nLittle will not be naming the victims citing national security and commercial confidentiality.\n\nIt reinforced the importance of organisations and individuals having strong cyber security\nmeasures in place, the minister said.\n\nThe GCSB said about 30 percent of serious malicious cyber activity in this country can be\nlinked to various state-sponsored actors.\n\n**Read more:**\n\n[The Red Line series](https://www.rnz.co.nz/programmes/red-line)\n[NZ risks giving China 'coercive power' over economy -
