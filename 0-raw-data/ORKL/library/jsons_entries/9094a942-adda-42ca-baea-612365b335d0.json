    "plain_text": "# Rocket Kitten Showing Its Claws: Operation Woolen- GoldFish and the GHOLE campaign\n\n**[trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/operation-woolen-goldfish-when-kittens-go-phishing](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/operation-woolen-goldfish-when-kittens-go-phishing)**\n\nView research paper: Operation Woolen Goldfish: When\n\nKittens Go Phishing\n\n\n-----\n\nRocket Kitten refers to a cyber threat group that has been hitting different public and private\nIsraeli/European organizations. It has launched two campaigns so far: a malware campaign\nthat exclusively makes use of GHOLE malware, as well as a targeted attack dubbed as\n“Operation Woolen-GoldFish” that's possibly state-sponsored.\n\nGHOLE is a malware family that was discussed in the 31st Chaos Communication Congress\nof the Chaos Computer Club (31C3), during a lecture that tackled its ongoing involvement in\ntargeted attacks. Based on the compilation date of its oldest samples, the malware is\nbelieved to have been active since 2011, and has been used by Rocket Kitten in their\ntargeted attacks.\n\nOperation Woolen-GoldFish, on the other hand, is a cyber attack campaign that we suspect\nto be state-sponsored, or at the very least politically-motivated. It has been attacking the\nfollowing targets:\n\nCivilian organizations in Israel\nAcademic organizations in Israel\nGerman speaking government organizations\nEuropean government organizations\nEuropean private companies\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Background, Analysis, Findings_**\n\n**GHOLE Malware Campaign:**\n\nIn February 2015, we received an alert that involved an infected Excel file that, upon\nanalysis, proved to be part of the GHOLE malware campaign, one of Rocket Kitten’s\ncampaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe GHOLE malware campaign involves victims being sent spear-phishing emails with\nmalicious attachments. The attachment is usually an Excel file that contains a\nmalicious macro.\nWhen clicked, the Excel file drops a .DLL file that will then be executed by the\nmalicious macro embedded in the Excel file.\nThe Excel file is tailored to trick the user into running the macro. If the user does not\nenable the macro content, the .DLL file will not be executed.\nGHOLE is a malware family derived from a modified Core Impact product. Core Impact\nis a penetration-testing product made by Core Security, a legitimate company.\nFurther analysis revealed that the GHOLE variants involved in the operation connect to\nC&C servers hosted mainly in Germany. The servers are registered under one\ncustomer by the name of Mehdi Mavadi. We are hesitant in attributing the attack to\nsuch an identity as the name itself is quite common, and that the customer’s servers\nmay simply be compromised and being used as a proxy rather than actually providing\ninfrastructure for the Rocket Kitten group.\n\n**Operation Woolen-GoldFish:**\n\nSimilar to the GHOLE malware campaign, Operation Woolen Goldfish involves spearphishing emailsembedded with a malicious link that leads to a OneDrive link. The link\ngoes directly to a malicious file download.\nThe malware payload was initially found to be a variant of GHOLE, but further samples\nled to te discovery of a new payload: a variant of a keylogger known as the CWoolger\nkeylogger. It is detected as TSPY_WOOLERG.A.\n\n**_Possible Attribution_**\n\nAnalyzing the malicious documents in the spear phishing emails of their Microsoft Office\nmetadata, we narrowed down the suspects to one “Wool3n.H4t”, whose name appears in\nmost of the document samples found as the last known modifier. His other accomplices\ninclude entities who go by the names “aikido1” and “Hoffman”.\n\nWe looked deeper into the identity of Wool3n.H4t and discovered the following:\n\nHe may have been running an underground hacking blog under the same nickname,\nwith the only two entries signed by “Masoud_pk”\n“Masoud_pk” may possibly be the true identity of Wool3n.H4t. “Masoud” belongs in the\ntop 500 commonly used first names in Iran.\nA debug string found in the CWoolger keylogger code shows that the compiler is\nidentified as Wool3n.H4T.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis report explores Rocket Kitten by analyzing the tools used to leverage its malicious\nactivities. From our findings we can definitely say that threat actor team is alive and active,\nand while the tracks they left behind—as well as their use of macros—might make them\nseem a bit inexperienced, they are slowly improving and gaining traction.\n\nWe are also able to confirm that Wool3n.H4T is not only responsible for most of the infecting\nOffice documents used, but also capable of developing malware.\n\nWith all the evidence, Rocket Kitten’s attacks can be construed as politically-motivated, as\nthe targeted entities do share a particular interest in the Islamic Republic of Iran. While\nmotives behind targeted attack campaigns differ, the end results are one and the same: shift\nin power control either in the economically or politically.\n\nRead the research paper Operation Woolen-GoldFish: When Kittens Go Phishing for a full,\ndetailed look into the activities and methods of Rocket Kitten.\n\nHIDE\n\n**Like it?
