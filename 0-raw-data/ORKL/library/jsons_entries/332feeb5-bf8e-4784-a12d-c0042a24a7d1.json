We’ve observed the “Read\n[The Manual” (RTM) Locker gang, previously known for their e-crime activities, targeting corporate](https://www.botconf.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Botconf2022-04-MyrakasymovRogachev.pdf)\nenvironments with their ransomware, and forcing their affiliates to follow a strict ruleset. Is this yet another\nransomware gang, or is there more to this gang and their locker than meets the eye? This blog investigates\nthe actor, along with a technical deep dive into their Windows ransomware executable.\n\nExecutive summary\n\nThe “Read The Manual” Locker gang uses affiliates to ransom victims, all of whom are forced to abide by the\ngang’s strict rules. The business-like set up of the group, where affiliates are required to remain active or notify\nthe gang of their leave, shows the organizational maturity of the group, as has also been observed in other\ngroups, such as [Conti.](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/conti-leaks-examining-the-panama-papers-of-ransomware.html)\n\nThe gang’s modus operandi is focused on a single goal: to fly below the radar. Their goal is not to make\nheadlines, but rather to make money while remaining unknown. The group’s notifications are posted in\nRussian and English, where the former is of better quality. Based on that, it isn’t surprising that the\nCommonwealth of Independent States in Eastern Europe and Asia (CIS) region is off-limits, ensuring no\nvictims are made in that area.\n\nLifting RTM’s veil\n\nThe RTM Locker gang’s panel provides a look into their rules, targets, and modus operandi. These provide an\ninsight into the group’s targets, and their way of working. Additionally, some estimated guesses regarding (a\npart of) the group’s members’ geographic locations can be made based on the available information.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe gang s panel and tactics\n\nThe panel’s login page requires a username and password combination, along with a captcha code to prevent\nbrute force login attempts by other actors and researchers alike.\n\nFigure 1 - The panel's login page\nWithin the panel, affiliates can add ransomed victims. This shows how the group’s methods are aligned with\nthe current of standard behavior of ransomware gangs: the intent to extort their victims twice. Once by\nencrypting files, and once by naming and shaming their victims by publishing stolen and exfiltrated data. The\nimage below shows the panel’s page to add victims; note the data release timer which is to be set by the\naffiliate.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 - The addition of a new target in the panel\nAn excerpt from the ransom note provides further evidence of the strategy: “All your documents, photos,\nreports, customer and employee data, databases and other important files are encrypted and you cannot\ndecrypt them yourself. They are also on our servers!” The complete ransom note is listed in Appendix A.\n\nAffiliate rules and exceptions\n\nThe affiliates need to remain active, or their account will be removed. Any affiliate who is inactive for 10 days\nwithout providing a notification upfront, will be locked out of the panel.\n\nFigure 3 - The notice from the group's administration mentioning that unexplained affiliate inactivity leads to a\nban from the group\nAside from avoiding lurking researchers within the group, this shows the gang’s posture is professionally\noriented with a clear hierarchy. This structure is further seen in the rest of the rules, which are clearly spelled\nout for affiliates, ensuring that the gang’s remains under the radar of the prying eyes of security researchers\nand law enforcement.\n\nTo stay off the radar, CIS countries are excluded, as well as morgues, hospitals, and COVID-19 vaccine\nrelated corporations. The specification with regards to hospitals is rather distinct, as a dentist’s office is named\nas an applicable target, unlike an actual hospital.\n\nThis rule ties in with the rule which states that headlines are to be avoided, meaning that vital infrastructure,\nlaw enforcement, and other major corporations are to be excluded from attacks, as these garner unwanted\nattention to the group. If such a case does occur, all traces to the RTM gang are to be removed, and the\nnegotiation is to be held via a separate platform, thus ensuring that those who obtain access to the negotiation\nchatroom via the sample do not see the ongoing discussion.\n\nWithin this private environment, a decryptor is likely provided to ensure the victim can silently recover the\nencrypted machines and resume their operations normally, although other ransomware cases have proven\nthat even with a decryptor, companies aren’t always likely to resume their day-to-day operations in a blink, as\nthe ransomware’s echo can last weeks or months, if not longer.\n\n\n-----\n\nLinking any negotiation chat publicly is prohibited and warrants the affiliate to be banned. Even though this is\nmore a statement rather than a fact, all chats are allegedly encrypted. The stolen data is also allegedly stored\non a different server, even though the RTM Locker website is only accessible via the TOR network, the actors\nseem to be cautious.\n\nTheir cautious attitude is not without reason, aside from the obvious implications of their illegal activities. Other\nransomware gangs have gotten to the point where they caught the attention of the mainstream media, making\nthem a priority for law enforcement and security researchers alike. An example of this is the DarkSide gang in\n[2021, after the Colonial Pipeline debacle attracted attention across the globe.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/business/darkside-pipeline-hack.html)\n\nRTM Locker malware builds are to be kept private, indicating that the actors want to ensure the builds are not\nanalyzed for as long as possible. As will become clear in the technical analysis, samples contain a self-delete\nmechanism which is invoked once the victim’s device is encrypted. This further strengthens the stealthy nature\nof their operations. Affiliates who do leak samples risk a ban, based on the affiliated ID within the locker.\n\nRedistribution of the RTM Locker by outsourcing the job to other self-hired affiliates is also forbidden, thus\nattempting to limit the amount of people with access to the samples.\n\nFinally, all communication with the RTM gang is to be done via the TOX messenger, and in no other way.\n\nFigure 4 - The group's rules\nGeographic location\n\nPer the RTM gang’s updates, there was an internal conflict due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, which ultimately\nlead to data leakage. The screenshot below shows their update.\n\nFigure 5 - The group's explanation with regards to the ongoing war in Ukraine\n\n\n-----\n\nThe screenshot reads: In connection with the current situation between Russia and Ukraine, there was an\nincident due to the fault of one of the participants about the drain of one of our servers, work is underway to\ntransfer and restore data. The bleeds of the new software will be made for some time by several of our\nexperienced negotiators. We apologize for the inconvenience!”\n\nBased on this, one can speculate that there are supporters and opponents of said war within the RTM gang,\nmaking it likely that one or more of the group’s members reside in Russia, whereas other members who\noppose the war are likely located in different geographical areas. This is further supported by the avoidance of\nCIS countries when the gang’s affiliates look for victims.\n\nTechnical analysis\n\nEven though the ransomware is not obfuscated, it does not contain symbols. The renamed functions and\nvariables within the analysis are given during the analysis. The ransomware follows a clear execution flow, as\nshown below.\n\nFigure 6 - The flow of\n\nthe Windows based RTM Locker sample\nIn the next sections, the locker will be examined in detail, along with code excerpts. The table below provides\nthe hashes of the analyzed sample.\n\nSHA-256\n\n\nc41a2ddf8c768d887b5eca283bbf8ea812a5f2a849f07c879808845af07409ed\n\nSHA-1\n\n\neaad989098815cc44e3bcb21167c7ada72c585fc\n\nMD-5\n\n\n3416b560bb1542af1124b38fb344fa1f\n\n\nElevated privileges\n\nTo cripple the targeted system more effectively, the RTM Locker encrypts as much files as possible. To ensure\nthe required permissions are acquired, the ransomware checks if it has administrative permissions on the builtin system domain, which provides unrestricted access to the device.\n\n\n-----\n\nRTM Locker does not utilize an exploit to obtain these permissions, it simply launches itself with the required\npermissions, resulting in a User Account Control dialog popping up. If the victim approves the execution, the\nnew process instance is launched with the requested administrative permissions, and the current locker\ninstance shuts itself down. If the victim rejects the prompt, the locker continuously requests it, until the\npermissions are granted. The image below shows this process in pseudo code.\n\nFigure 7\n\n- The pseudo code related to the locker's request for administrative privileges\nDebugging console\n\nWithin the locker’s main function, right after the elevated privilege check completed, the command-line\narguments are checked. If there is a sole argument which equals “-debug”, the console output is set. This\nallows the locker to print debug data, calls to do so are encountered throughout the ransomware’s code. The\nscreenshot below shows the check of the command-line argument, as well as the call to the function which\nsets the console output.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8 - A check for the \"-debug\" command-line\n\nargument\nEnvironmental awareness\n\nThe locker’s next step is to ensure it can maximize its impact by terminating processes which can either block\na file (such as Office applications), or which are used during the analysis of malicious files, such as x64dbg.\nThe pseudo code below shows the iteration over all the running processes, and the stopping of selected\nprocesses.\n\nFigure 9\n\n- Process detection and closure\nAs soon as the currently iterated process’ name is within the process list within the locker, the process is\nterminated with exit code 9. Note that the previously acquired administrative privileges on the system aid the\nlocker’s attempt to close all processes which it considers detrimental to its existence.\n\nThe following processes are checked for by the locker: sql.exe, oracle.exe, ocssd.exe, dbsnmp.exe,\nsynctime.exe, agntsvc.exe, isqlplussvc.exe, xfssvccon.exe, mydesktopservice.exe, ocautoupds.exe,\nencsvc.exe, firefox.exe, tbirdconfig.exe, mydesktopqos.exe, ocomm.exe, dbeng50.exe, sqbcoreservice.exe,\nexcel.exe, infopath.exe, msaccess.exe, mspub.exe, onenote.exe, outlook.exe, powerpnt.exe, steam.exe,\nthebat.exe, thunderbird.exe, visio.exe, winword.exe, wordpad.exe, and notepad.exe\n\nThe locker’s next step is to stop all services present within an embedded list. The pseudo code below shows\nthe iteration over and stopping of selected services.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10 - Service detection and stopping\nThe targeted services are responsible for anti-virus protection and back-ups, as can be seen here: vss, sql,\nsvc$, memtas, mepocs, sophos, veeam, backup, GxVss, GxBlr, GxFWD, GxCVD, GxCIMgr, DefWatch,\nccEvtMgr, ccSetMgr, SavRoam, RTVscan, QBFCService, QBIDPService, Intuit.QuickBooks.FCS,\nQBCFMonitorService, YooBackup, YooIT, zhudongfangyu, stc_raw_agent, VSNAPVSS, VeeamTransportSvc,\nVeeamDeploymentService, VeeamNFSSvc, PDVFSService, BackupExecVSSProvider,\nBackupExecAgentAccelerator, BackupExecAgentBrowser, BackupExecDiveciMediaService,\nBackupExecJobEngine, BackupExecManagementService, BackupExecRPCService, ArcSch2Svc,\nAcronisAgent, CASAD2DWebSvc, and CAARCUpdateSvc.\n\nAnother check which the locker performs, is the CPU’s capabilities to perform SSE2 related operations, which\nare, later on, used for cryptographic operations.\n\nSetting the stage\n\nPrior to starting the encryption process, the locker empties the recycle bin (without asking for confirmation,\nshowing the progress on-screen, or playing the completion sound), and it deletes the shadow copies. This\nensures that victims cannot restore files directly from the recycle bin or via the shadow copies after the locker\nhas taken the device hostage. The image below shows the related pseudocode.\n\nFigure 11 \nEmptying of the recycle bin and the removal of the shadow copies\nNext, the machine’s volumes are iterated, where non-used volume letters are assigned a mount point for\nunmounted partitions on all volumes. A maximum of 26 drive letters are used within the locker, as can be seen\nin the pseudo code below. Note that the order of the drives is based on the QWERTY keyboard lay-out. This\nmight indicate the locker creator(s) used such a lay-out during the development.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12 - The qwerty-keyboard based drive letter order array\n\nThe iteration happens by looping over the drives array, where each drive’s type is checked. If the drive type\nindicates that no volume is mounted for the given drive, it is stored in a different array, named\n“unmountedDrives” in the pseudo code below.\n\nFigure 13 - Generating the list of unmapped drive\n\nletters\nThe machine’s first volume is then iterated, and partitions on it are mounted to unused drives if possible. Note\nthat the array’s iteration starts at the end, meaning that the first new drive to be created, is “M:\\”.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14\n\n- Mounting all volumes to unmapped letters\nThe reason to mount all partitions on the attached volumes is to increase the number of files which can be\nencrypted by the locker, as all attached volumes are iterated upon, or until all drive letters are in use.\n\nFile encryption\n\nOnce all partitions are mounted, the iteration over all drives begins. This time with the intent to encrypt the\nencountered files, barring some exclusions. The pseudo code below shows the differentiation between remote\nand local drive types, after which the folder parsing function is called.\n\nFigure 15 - The call to\n\nencrypt a (remote) drive\nA folder separating backslash and a wildcard are appended to the provided path, after which the first file at the\ngiven location is searched for. If there is no such path, the function returns. If there is, a check is performed if\nthe excluded folder list contains the current name. If this is the case, a check is performed if the given file is a\nfile or a folder. When the path refers to a folder, the function is called recursively, thus including subfolders. If\nthe path refers to a file, which is not equal to the name of the ransom note, nor has an extension that is 65\ncharacters long, the file specific encryption function is called. The pseudocode below provides an overview of\nthe process that is described above.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16\n\n- The file iteration to determine if a file should be encrypted\nThe excluded names are the following: windows, appdata, application data, boot, google, mozilla, program\nfiles, program files (x86), programdata, system volume information, tor browser, windows.old, intel, msocache,\nperflogs, x64dbg, public, all users, default, ., and ..\n\nThe encrypted file gets a random 64-character extension based on 32 randomly generated bytes, where each\nbyte is displayed using two characters. The previously mentioned 65-character extension check is due to the\nreturn value of PathFindExtensionW, which returns a pointer to the extension’s dot, thus adding a character to\nthe extension length.\n\nThe random data is generated using the RtlGenRandom function, which is an undescribed import which is to\nbe manually resolved from advapi32 under the name of “SystemFunction036”. The pseudo code for the\nrandom data generation is given below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17 - Resolving the undocumented\n\n\"SystemFunction036\", also known as RtlGenRandom\nThe encryption of the files on the victim’s machine happens in a multi-threaded fashion, maximizing the impact\nby minimizing the time which is required to encrypt all files on the disk. There is, however, more to the multithreading within this locker than simply iterating and encrypting files in multiple threads.\n\nThe locker uses Input/Output Completion Ports (abbreviated as IOCP), allowing multiple threads to work with\nthe same file at the same time, based on signals that are sent between the threads. In this case, different\ntypes of threads are used for the encryption and the IOCP, as can be seen in the pseudo code below where\nthe two types of threads are created. Note that this code is called earlier on but is only discussed now as it is\nrelevant from here on out.\n\nFigure 18\n\n- The set-up to encrypt the files using multiple threads\nThe system information structure is filled by an earlier call to GetSystemInfo. The number of processors is\nused multiple times. First, to create IOCP threads, which number equals to twice the amount of the number of\nprocessors in the system information structure. It is then used to create encryption threads, one for each\n\n\n-----\n\nprocessor in the structure. Additionally, the number of processors is stored in a global variable, which is used\nto, atomically, keep track of the amount running encryption threads.\n\nThe encryption thread opens a file with direct access, as it excludes buffers. The\n“FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED” flag is required to use a file with IOCP. A check is then performed if the given\nfile’s size is 512 byte or more. If the file size is less, it is not encrypted. The custom structure which is used in\nthe communication between the encryption and IOCP thread pair is then set up, where the action key defines\nthe action which should be taken. The used actions within the locker are given below.\n\n**Value**\n\n\n**Action**\n\n0xa1\n\n\nHandle the read file\n\n0xa2\n\n\nWrites the encrypted data\n\n0xa3\n\n\nRenames the file by moving it\n\n\nThe above-described actions are shown in the pseudo code below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n19 - The creation of the overlapped structure\nThe original name, as well as the new name, is stored in the custom structure, after which an IOCP is created,\nwhich is then posted, thus notifying the paired IOCP thread.\n\nFigure 20 - Sending\n\nthe created structure to the IO completion port\nWithin the IOCP thread, multiple actions can be performed, based upon any of the aforementioned action key\nvalues. Each action code sets the next code, thus moving through the process step-by-step. The read action is\nshown in the pseudo code below.\n\nFigure 21 - The read\n\naction\nThe next step is to encrypt and write the file’s data to the file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22 - The encrypt and write\n\naction\nThe last action key is moving the file within the same folder, essentially changing the file’s extension.\n\nFigure 23 - The\n\nrename action\nThe final encryption thread will change the wallpaper of the machine, which is yet another sign to the victim\nthat the device is compromised, along with the ransom notes and the encrypted files. Note the atomic check if\nthe local drive letter is below “Z”, which is the highest drive value that is possible. The starting value of 0x40 is\none less than the capital letter “A”, the lowest possible drive. The pseudo code below shows the wallpaper\nchange.\n\nFigure 24 \nChange the wallpaper\nThe new wallpaper is shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25 - The newly set wallpaper by the RTM Locker\nWaiting for the encryption to finish\n\nOnce all threads are running, the main function continues, as it calls a sleep loop. This allows the threads to\nswitch and continue their execution, until all are finished as they decrement the variable’s value.\n\nFigure 26 - Wait for the encryption to finish\n\nClear the logs\n\nThe one-but-last action the locker performs wipes the System, Application, and Security logs from the\nmachine. The wiping allows a back-up file to be specified, which is left void on purpose, ensuring the log is\ncompletely wiped.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 27 - Clear the\n\nevent logs\nSelf destruction\n\nAt last, the locker executes a shell command, which executes “cmd.exe /c PING -n 5 127.0.0.1 > NUL && del\n“[path]””. The path variable is enclosed between quotes to ensure it is parsed as a single command-line\nargument if there is a space somewhere in the path. The path is equal to the complete path to the locker’s\nexecutable. Once the shell command has been issued, the locker shuts down. The ping command allows the\nlocker’s process to shut down, making the delete command successful thereafter. Otherwise, the locker could\nstill be running, and thus in use, meaning the deletion would fail. The pseudo code for the described actions is\ngiven below.\n\nFigure 28 - Self\n\ndelete asynchronically\nDetection coverage\n\n**Product**\n\n**Signature**\n\n\n**Endpoint Security (ENS)**\n\n\nRTMLocker!3416B560BB15\n\n\n-----\n\n**Endpoint Security (HX)**\n\n\nHX-AV :\nGen:Variant.Doina.25486 & Generic.mg.3416b560bb1542af\nHXIOC: RTM LOCKER RANSOMWARE (FAMILY)\n\n\n**Network Security (NX)**\n\n**Detection as a Service**\n\n**Email Security**\n\n**Malware Analysis**\n\n**File Protect**\n\n\nRansomware.Win.Generic.MVX\nSuspicious Infector Activity\nSuspicious Ransomware Activity\n\n\n**EDR**\n\n\n_file_ep0171_deletecmd\n_file_ep0075_76_ransom\n\n\n[Information about this group can be found in Insights, an excerpt of which is shown below.

It is, however, unlikely that this locker is to be distributed via an\nautomated campaign given how it only properly works once it’s obtained the required administrative privileges.\nSince most corporate environments do not provide these permissions to most users, it is more likely that the\nlocker is to be executed once a network is within an actor’s control already. Actors can leverage phishing\nattacks, malicious spam (commonly known as malspam), vulnerable publicly exposed systems, or bought\naccess to get control of the targeted systems. Also take note of the group’s aim to operate without garnering\nattention, which ties into the lack of direct spreading via malspam, as it would shine a light on the group’s\nactions.\n\nBased on the group’s modus operandi, it looks like the group is opportunity based, rather than targeting a\nsingle industry, nor very specific corporations. The rules define a clear scope as to what is a potential target,\nallowing affiliates to operate as they see fit. The gang’s primary objective seems to make money, rather than a\npolitical motive.\n\nAppendix A – RTM Locker’s Ransom Note\n\nThe complete ransom note which is dropped by the locker is given below.
