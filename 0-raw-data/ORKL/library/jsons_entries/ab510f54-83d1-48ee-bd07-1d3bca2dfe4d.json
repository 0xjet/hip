A recorded video of the presentation is already online. You can watch\nit here:\n\n\nWatch Video At: https://youtu.be/yVqALLtvkN8\n\n\n-----\n\nAll of our research, including a full set of IoCs and Yara rules, is written up in the two part report DiceyF Deploys\nGamePlayerFramework in Online Casino Development Studio”, already available to our private report subscribers. Some technical\nanalysis from the report is provided here, along with a reference set of IoCs. You can find more information about trial and pay report\n[subscription options at intelreports@kaspersky.com.](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## Who is at the table\n\nWe call this APT “DiceyF”. They have been targeting online casinos and other victims in Southeast Asia reportedly for years now.\nOur research shows overlap with LuckyStar PlugX, a supply chain incident privately reported. TTPs, secure messaging client abuse,\nmalware, and targeting demonstrate that this set of activity and resources align with Earth Berberoka/GamblingPuppet activity\ndiscussed at [Botconf 2022 by Trend Micro researchers, also discussed as an unknown or developing cluster by other vendors. Prior](https://youtu.be/QXGO4RJaUPQ)\nto “Operation Earth Berberoka”, Trend Micro reported on “Operation DRBControl”, which also aligns with this activity and resource\nset.\n\nSo, do we have another Ocean’s Eleven Clooney-Pitt duo targeting the largest casinos for shocking levels of criminality, revenge,\nand theft? No we don’t. In the related DiceyF incident that we report on, there was no evidence observed to date of immediate\nfinancial motivation or cash theft. Instead, previous incidents reported by TrendMicro researchers have exhibited customer PII\ndatabase exfiltration and source code theft. Possibly we have a mix of espionage and IP theft, but the true motivations remain a\nmystery.\n\n## Rolling the dice\n\nAn interesting combination of detections and characteristics sparked interest in this activity. These data points included\n\nPlugX installers signed by a potentially stolen digital certificate from a secure messaging client development studio\nMalware distribution via an employee monitoring system and a security package deployment service\nUnusual .NET code signed with the same potentially stolen certificate and calling back to the same domain as the PlugX C2\n\nIn November 2021, multiple PlugX loaders and payloads were detected in a network, which is often a wearisome topic to\ninvestigate. However, this time, the PlugX installer triad was deployed via two methods as an executable signed with a legitimate\ndigital certificate — an employee monitoring service and a security package deployment service. This legitimate digital certificate\nappeared to have been stolen from a development and build studio for a secure messaging client. These PlugX payloads\ncommunicated with a C2 at apps.imangolm[.]com. Not much later, this same security package deployment service was used to push\nGamePlayerFramework downloaders, with these downloaders communicating with the same C2, and signed with the same digital\ncertificate.\n\nFurther research revealed a targeting profile suggesting an online casino development studio, and later, recruited/outsourced\ndevelopment systems on disparate networks. Waves of .NET downloader deployments followed and coincided with the PlugX\ndeployments, signed by the same digital certificate.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese downloaders maintained PDB strings with “PuppetLoader” filepaths. These PuppetLoader strings pretty clearly connected the\nmultistage loaders with past PuppetLoader downloaders, only this time, redesigned and rewritten in C#. Past PuppetLoaders, written\nin C++, maintain explicit strings:\n\nThe new .NET code maintains similar strings, reflecting the previous codebase from several years ago.\n\nWhile these findings were being analyzed and reported, the folks from Trend Micro reported on GamblingPuppet/Earth Berberoka at\nBotconf, and we are confident that this DiceyF GamePlayerFramework activity is a subsequent campaign with a newly developed\ncore malware set. This APT, DiceyF, aligns the previously reported GamblingPuppet and Operation DRBControl resources and\nactivity, which we also observed in earlier data as well:\n\nPlugX and PuppetLoader multistage loader\nOnline casino targeting in Southeast Asia\nLack of evidence presenting a financial motivation (Trend Micro observed customer database and source code exfiltration in\nOperation DRBControl)\nChinese language in use, particularly GamePlayerFramework error strings and plugin names and paths\nData theft focus for backdoors includes keystrokes and clipboard\nStolen digital certificate re-use\nObscure secure messaging client as delivery vehicle for malware and cloak for malicious activity\n\nGamePlayerFramework is a complete C# rewrite of the previously mentioned PuppetLoader C++/assembly malware. This\n“framework” includes downloaders, launchers, and a set of plugins that provide remote access and steal keystrokes and clipboard\ndata. The newer (summer 2022) executables are mostly all 64-bit .NET compiled with .NET v4.5.1, but some are 32-bit, or DLLs and\n\n\n-----\n\ncompiled with .NET v4.0. There are at least two branches to this framework, Tifa and Yuna, and both branches maintain new\nmodules, incrementally modified over time:\n\nD:\\Code\\Fucker\\GamePlayerFramework\\Tifa\\*.pdb\nC:\\Users\\fucker\\Desktop\\Fucker\\GamePlayerFramework\\Tifa\\*.pdb\nD:\\Code\\Fucker\\GamePlayerFramework\\Yuna\\*.pdb\n\n## FinalFantasy code quirks\n\nPlayers may be familiar with the FinalFantasy game series, where Tifa and Yuna are two of the main characters. The Tifa and Yuna\nbranches are different from one another: the Tifa branch includes only a downloader and a “core” module; the Yuna branch includes\na downloader, plugins, and various PuppetLoader components, at least a dozen in total. Even the downloaders are fairly different\nfrom one another. As a matter of fact, the Yuna.Downloader code changes quite a bit over time, including with JSON parsing,\nlogging, and encryption capabilities. Ongoing code development is on display here.\n\nThe Tifa branch of code was deployed to victims first in November 2021, and these Tifa downloaders maintain more primitive\nfunctionality than the later Yuna downloaders. Additionally, it appears that code-signing coordination was not well organized in\nNovember. Except for one Tifa executable that was signed, two of the three Tifa downloaders were unsigned code, unlike the Yuna\ndownloaders.\n\nThe initial Tifa downloaders were already using “Mango” and “Mongo” function names just like artifacts found in Yuna downloaders,\nalong with the aforementioned apps.imangolm[.]com C2 used by the PlugX implant. Later Yuna downloaders were distributed with\nthe filename “mango.exe”. Two of the Tifa.Downloader variants introduced a “DownloaderVersion” string, likely for the attackers to\nmaintain backwards compatibility on the server side. Some later Yuna.Downloader variants increase in functionality and complexity,\nbut multiple early variants and the Tifa branch are quite simple.\n\n## Loading the framework\n\nOnce downloaded and persistence set up, multiple components load the framework. The overall process of loading the framework\ncan be summarized with the following graph:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis load sequence results in running the “Launcher” component. Despite the name, the main functionality of this module is not to\nperform launching. Instead, it is the orchestrator of the framework, i.e. it manages all the framework components. After completing\nthe startup process, the orchestrator starts sending heartbeat packets to the C2 server every 20 seconds. Each such packet is a\nXOR-encrypted JSON object that contains the following information:\n\nUsername of the logged-in user\nCurrent user session status (locked or unlocked)\nSize of logs collected by the clipboard recorder plugin\nCurrent date and time\n\nThe C2 responds with one of fifteen commands.\n\nCommand name Command arguments Description\n\n\nPluginKeepAlive,\nKeepAlive\n\n\nN/A Updates an internal timestamp with the last C2 response time\n\n\nPluginDestory [sic] N/A Shuts down the framework\n\n\n-----\n\nGetSystemInfo N/A Retrieves various system information, namely:\n\nLocal network IP addresses\nAvailable privileges (SYSTEM, administrator or normal user)\nNetwork protocol used for C2 communication (hardcoded to Tcpv4 in\nall discovered samples)\nFramework version (in format yyyymmdd.xx, e.g. 20220506.00)\nDownloader module version\nCPU name\nAvailable RAM\nOperating system version\nAddress of the C2 server that is in use\nSize of clipboard recorder logs\nInstalled security solution\nBIOS serial number\nMAC addresses\nMachine boot time\n\n\nFastCmd Command: command to be\nexecuted\n\n\nAllows execution of shell commands; this command creates a new cmd.exe\nprocess with redirected standard input and output and sends commands to\nit; the output of executed commands is sent back to the C2 server\n\n\nGetDomainSetting N/A Sends the list of C2 servers specified in the configuration to the current C2\nserver\n\n\nSetDomainSetting DomainConfig: IP\naddresses and ports of\nnew C2 servers\n\nGetRemotePluginInfo PluginName: name of an\ninstalled plugin\n\nRunPlugin PluginName: name of the\nplugin to be launched\nSessionId: ID of the\nsession inside which the\nplugin is to be launched\n\n\nUpdates the list of C2 servers in the configuration by writing new C2 server\naddresses to the file C:\\ProgramData\\NVIDIA\\DConfig\n\nRetrieves the version of a locally installed plugin\n\nDownloads a plugin from the C2 server and launches it\n\n\nDeleteGuid N/A Removes the infection from the machine by creating a batch file that\nremoves all files dropped by the framework installer except for\nrascustoms.dll; after performing removal, the batch file deletes itself\n\n\nFastDownload FilePath: path of the file to\nbe uploaded\n\nCachePlugin PluginName: name of the\nplugin\nPluginVersion: version of\nthe plugin\n\nInstallPlugin PluginName: name of the\nplugin to be launched\nWaitForExitTimeout:\ntimeout interval\n\nRemoteInject SubMsg: a string equal to\neither RunVirtualDesktop\nor DestoryVirtualDesktop\n\n[sic]\n\nChromeCookie SubMsg: a string equal to\neither RunChromeCookie\nor GetCookiePath\n\nFirefoxCookie SubMsg: a string equal to\neither RunFirefoxCookie or\nGetCookiePath\n\n## Plugins overview\n\n\nUploads a file from the victim machine\n\nDownloads a plugin from the C2 server but does not launch it\n\nLaunches a plugin on the victim machine, waiting until the plugin process\nfinishes; in case of a timeout, the orchestrator kills the plugin process\n\nEither starts (if SubMsg is RunVirtualDesktop) or stops (if SubMsg is\nDestoryVirtualDesktop) the VirtualDesktop plugin\n\nIf SubMsg is RunChromeCookie, launches the ChromeCookie plugin; if the\nargument string is GetCookiePath, returns the path where Chrome cookies\nare stored\n\nIf SubMsg is RunFirefoxCookie, launches the FirefoxCookie plugin; if the\nargument string is GetCookiePath, returns the path where Firefox cookies\nare stored\n\n\n-----\n\nPlugins are EXE files that execute most of the framework s malicious activities. Plugins can be configured to be downloaded from\nthe C2 server when the framework starts up or is loaded at any other time using one of the commands above. During its execution,\na plugin may connect to the C2 server and receive commands from it. Information about running plugins is stored in the\nC:\\ProgramData\\NVIDIA\\DisplaySessionContainer1.ini file.\n\nAll plugins of the framework are stored in a fileless way. Whenever a plugin is downloaded from the C2 server, it is loaded into the\nframework with the following procedure:\n\nThe orchestrator selects a random port from 10000 to 20000 and launches a local TCP socket server on it.\nThe orchestrator creates a new svchost.exe process in suspended mode and injects the api-ms-win-core-sys-l1-0-5.dll library\nmentioned in the “Loading the Framework” section.\nThe injected library loads the PuppetLoader.Downloader component with the following arguments: -LoadName <plugin name>\n-PacketId <internal ID of the network packet with the plugin payload> -Port <server port generated at the first step>.\nThe Yuna.PuppetLoader.Downloader component downloads the plugin executable from the local TCP server and loads it\nusing Load.\n\nThe strings of the orchestrator component reference the following plugin names:\n\nPlugin.采集系统 (Acquisition System)\nPlugin.隐藏进程 (Hidden Process)\nPlugin.SSH\nPlugin.常用功能插件 (General Purpose Plugin)\nPlugin.SessionCmd\nPlugin.端口转发 (Port Forwarding)\nPlugin.屏幕传输 (Screen Transfer)\nPlugin.虚拟桌面 (Virtual Desktop)\nPlugin.剪贴板 (Clipboard)\nPlugin.ChromeCookie\nPlugin.FirefoxCookie\n\nWhile tracking deployments of GamePlayerFramework, we observed several plugins out of the list above being used: General\nPurpose Plugin, Clipboard and Virtual Desktop.\n\n## Malicious app with graphical interface\n\nThe application deployed through installation packages of security solutions was designed to mimic an application that synchronizes\ndata of the Mango messaging application. Below is the window displayed to the victim when this application starts:\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Window of the malicious “Mango Employee Account Data Synchronizer”_**\n\nIn order to make the victim user trust the malicious window, the attackers employed social engineering. As can be seen from the\nscreenshot above, they included the name of the victim organization and even the floor where the organization’s IT department is\nlocated. At the same time, the visible window makes this application less suspicious to security solutions.\n\nWhen started, this application:\n\nConnects to the C2 server via a TCP socket. The address and port of the server is specified in the binary. In case connection\nfails, the application displays a message window with the “无法连接到芒果员工数据同步服务器! 请反馈至IT部门!” text (“Unable\nto connect to Mango employee data synchronization server! Please report back to the IT department”).\nSends the following information to the C2 server:\nVersion of the installed Mango messenger\nMachine name\nCurrent username\nOperation system version\nList of local IPv4 addresses\nReceives a JSON object containing a Boolean value named IsErrorMachine. If it is set to true, the application displays a\nmessage window with the “尚未认证的机器, 请到10楼的IT部添加机器认证” text (“Machines that have not been certified, please\ngo to the IT department on the 10th floor to add machine certification”) and exits.\nLaunches the exe executable located inside the same directory as the application. The internal name of this file is\nYuna.Downloader.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe code is under continuous incremental change and its versioning reflects a semi professional management of the codebase\nmodifications. Over time, the group added Newtonsoft JSON library support, enhanced logging, and encryption for logging.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n**Domain** **IP** **First seen** **ASN**\n\napps.imangolm[.]com 202.182.115.238 20211106 20473, AS-CHOOPA\n\nquic.flashesplayer[.]com 202.182.115.238 2021-11-10 20473, AS-CHOOPA\n\narchivess.imangoim[.]net 45.77.47.149 20220506 20473, AS-CHOOPA\n\nAs described above, much of the early implants’ (both PlugX and the downloaders) communications activity calls back to\ninfrastructure by resolving FQDN for infrastructure located in Southeast Asia. Later into April 2022, some of the Yuna.Downloaders\nbegan communicating directly with a hardcoded IP address.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere are many interesting characteristics of DiceyF campaigns and TTPs. The group modifies their codebase over time, and\ndevelops functionality in the code throughout their intrusions.\n\nOrganizations need to maintain solid efforts in monitoring software deployed across their organizations. The deployment systems\nthemselves and the deployment process require heightened monitoring and maintenance: what gets deployed, when it gets\ndeployed, and whose credentials are being used. The systems themselves need to be hardened and security products installed and\nupdated.\n\nGamePlayerFramework enabled DiceyF, the actor behind this framework, to perform cyberespionage activities with some level of\nstealth. The initial infection method is noteworthy in that the framework is distributed via installation packages deployed through\nsecurity solution control centers. Furthermore, the components of this framework are signed with a digital certificate that makes the\nframework more trusted by security solutions. In order to further disguise the malicious components, attackers added a graphical\ninterface to some of them. Such implants are masqueraded as components of a messenger that is used at the victim organizations.\nTo make sure that victims did not become suspicious of the disguised implants, attackers obtained information about targeted\norganizations (such as the floor where the organization’s IT department is located) and included it inside graphic windows displayed\nto victims. They also used service names, file paths, digital signing certificates, and other artifacts from NVIDIA, Mango, and other\nlegitimate software. Plugins of GamePlayerFramework allow extensive monitoring of victim machines. For example, they are able to\nmonitor keystrokes and the clipboard, browse websites located inside the organization’s local network, or establish virtual desktop\nsessions. And over the course of several months, DiceyF developers added more encryption capabilities to better hide their logging\nand monitoring activities. In the future, we expect to see an increase in the number of plugins and observe more unusual defense\nevasion methods in this framework.\n\nFinally, the deployment tactic used here isn’t quite as sophisticated as infecting an external component of the supply chain itself, but\ncan be extremely effective.\n\n##
