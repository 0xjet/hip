Or almost did.\n\nIt was a spring evening, he says, three days—maybe four, time had become a blur—after he\nhad first begun tracking the hackers who were rummaging through the computer systems of\nRSA, the corporate security giant where he worked. Leetham—a bald, bearded, and\ncurmudgeonly analyst one coworker described to me as a “carbon-based hacker-finding\nmachine”—had been glued to his laptop along with the rest of the company’s incident\nresponse team, assembled around the company’s glass-encased operations center in a\nnonstop, 24-hours-a-day hunt. And with a growing sense of dread, Leetham had finally\ntraced the intruders’ footprints to their final targets: the secret keys known as “seeds,” a\ncollection of numbers that represented a foundational layer of the security promises RSA\nmade to its customers, including tens of millions of users in government and military\nagencies, defense contractors, banks, and countless corporations around the world.\n\n[This article appears in the July/August 2021 issue. Subscribe to WIRED.](https://subscribe.wired.com/subscribe/splits/wired/WIR_Edit_Hardcoded?source=HCL_WIR_COVER_INSET_0)\n\nPhotograph: Djeneba Aduayom\n\n\n-----\n\nRSA kept those seeds on a single, well-protected server, which the company called the\n“seed warehouse.” They served as a crucial ingredient in one of RSA's core products:\nSecurID tokens—little fobs you carried in a pocket and pulled out to prove your identity by\nentering the six-digit codes that were constantly updated on the fob's screen. If someone\ncould steal the seed values stored in that warehouse, they could potentially clone those\nSecurID tokens and silently break the two-factor authentication they offered, allowing\nhackers to instantly bypass that security system anywhere in the world, accessing anything\nfrom bank accounts to national security secrets.\n\nNow, staring at the network logs on his screen, it looked to Leetham like these keys to RSA’s\nglobal kingdom had already been stolen.\n\nLeetham saw with dismay that the hackers had spent nine hours methodically siphoning the\nseeds out of the warehouse server and sending them via file-transfer protocol to a hacked\nserver hosted by Rackspace, a cloud-hosting provider. But then he spotted something that\ngave him a flash of hope: The logs included the stolen username and password for that\nhacked server. The thieves had left their hiding place wide open, in plain sight. Leetham\nconnected to the faraway Rackspace machine and typed in the stolen credentials. And there\nit was: The server’s directory still contained the entire pilfered seed collection as a\ncompressed .rar file.\n\nUsing hacked credentials to log into a server that belongs to another company and mess\nwith the data stored there is, Leetham admits, an unorthodox move at best—and a violation\nof US hacking laws at worst. But looking at RSA’s stolen holiest of holies on that Rackspace\nserver, he didn’t hesitate. “I was going to take the heat,” he says. “Either way, I'm saving our\nshit.” He typed in the command to delete the file and hit enter.\n\nMoments later, his computer’s command line came back with a response: “File not found.”\nHe examined the Rackspace server’s contents again. It was empty. Leetham’s heart fell\nthrough the floor: The hackers had pulled the seed database off the server seconds before\nhe was able to delete it.\n\nAfter hunting these data thieves day and night, he had “taken a swipe at their jacket as they\nwere running out the door,” as he says today. They had slipped through his fingers, escaping\ninto the ether with his company’s most precious information. And though Leetham didn’t yet\nknow it, those secrets were now in the hands of the Chinese military.\n\n**Content**\n\n[This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.](https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1065829600%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-CyXelff2UCa&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true)\n\n[Listen to the full story here or on the Curio app.](https://curio.io/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe RSA breach, when it became public days later, would redefine the cybersecurity\nlandscape. The company’s nightmare was a wake-up call not only for the information security\nindustry—the worst-ever hack of a cybersecurity firm to date—but also a warning to the rest\nof the world. Timo Hirvonen, a researcher at security firm F-Secure, which published an\n[outside analysis of the breach, saw it as a disturbing demonstration of the growing threat](https://archive.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002225.html)\nposed by a new class of state-sponsored hackers. “If a security company like RSA cannot\nprotect itself,” Hirvonen remembers thinking at the time, “how can the rest of the world?”\n\nThe question was quite literal. The theft of the company's seed values meant that a critical\nsafeguard had been removed from thousands of its customers’ networks. RSA's SecurID\ntokens were designed so that institutions from banks to the Pentagon could demand a\nsecond form of authentication from their employees and customers beyond a username and\npassword—something physical in their pocket that they could prove they possessed, thus\nproving their identity. Only after typing in the code that appeared on their SecurID token (a\ncode that typically changed every 60 seconds) could they gain access to their account.\n\nThe SecurID seeds that RSA generated and carefully distributed to its customers allowed\nthose customers’ network administrators to set up servers that could generate the same\ncodes, then check the ones users entered into login prompts to see if they were correct.\nNow, after stealing those seeds, sophisticated cyberspies had the keys to generate those\ncodes without the physical tokens, opening an avenue into any account for which someone’s\nusername or password was guessable, had already been stolen, or had been reused from\nanother compromised account. RSA had added an extra, unique padlock to millions of doors\naround the internet, and these hackers now potentially knew the combination to every one.\n\nThis past December, when it became public that the company SolarWinds was hacked by\nRussian spies, the world woke up to the notion of a “supply chain attack”: a technique in\nwhich an adversary compromises a point of vulnerability in a software or hardware supplier\npositioned upstream from—and out of sight of—its target, a blind spot in the victim's view of\ntheir cybersecurity risks. The Kremlin operatives who hacked SolarWinds hid espionage\ncode in an IT management tool called Orion, used by as many as 18,000 companies and\ninstitutions globally.\n\nUsing the SolarWinds supply chain compromise, Russia’s foreign intelligence agency, known\nas the SVR, [penetrated deep into at least nine US federal agencies, including the State](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-solarwinds-hack-targets-fallout/)\nDepartment, the US Treasury, the Department of Justice, and NASA. In another worldshaking supply chain attack just a few years earlier, Russia’s military intelligence agency,\nknown as the GRU, hijacked a piece of obscure Ukrainian accounting software to push out a\ndata-destroying worm known as NotPetya, inflicting $10 billion in damage worldwide in the\nworst cyberattack in history.\n\nFor those with a longer memory, though, the RSA breach was the original massive supply\nchain attack. State cyberspies—who were later revealed to be working in the service of\nChina’s People’s Liberation Army—penetrated infrastructure relied on across the globe to\n\n\n-----\n\nprotect the internet. And in doing so, they pulled the rug out from under the entire world s\nmodel of digital security. “It opened my eyes to supply chain attacks,” says Mikko Hypponen,\nchief research officer at F-Secure, who worked with Hirvonen on the company's analysis of\nthe RSA breach. “It changed my view of the world: the fact that, if you can’t break into your\ntarget, you find the technology that they use and break in there instead.”\n\nIn the decade that followed, many key RSA executives involved in the company’s breach\nhave held their silence, bound by 10-year nondisclosure agreements. Now those agreements\nhave expired, allowing them to tell me their stories in new detail. Their accounts capture the\nexperience of being targeted by sophisticated state hackers who patiently and persistently\ntake on their most high-value networked targets on a global scale, where an adversary\nsometimes understands the interdependencies of its victims’ systems better than victims do\nthemselves, and is willing to exploit those hidden relationships.\n\nAfter 10 years of rampant state-sponsored hacking and supply chain hijacks, the RSA\nbreach can now be seen as the herald of our current era of digital insecurity—and a lesson\nabout how a determined adversary can undermine the things we trust most.\n\nOn March 8, 2011, a brisk late-winter day, Todd Leetham finished a smoke break and was\nwalking back into RSA’s headquarters in Bedford, Massachusetts—a pair of connected\nbuildings on the edge of a forest in the Boston suburbs—when a systems administrator\npulled him aside and asked him to take a look at something strange.\n\nThe admin had noticed that one user had accessed a server from a PC that the user didn’t\ntypically work on, and that the permissions setting on the account seemed unusual. A\ntechnical director investigating the anomalous login with Leetham and the admin asked Bill\nDuane, a veteran RSA engineer, to take a look. To Duane, who was busy working on a\ncryptographic algorithm at the time, the anomaly hardly looked like cause for alarm. “I frankly\nthought this administrator was crazy,” he remembers. “Fortunately he was stubborn enough\nto insist that something was wrong.”\n\nLeetham and the company’s security incident responders started to trace the aberrant\nbehavior and analyze the forensics of every machine the anomalous account had touched.\nThey began to see more telltale oddities in employees’ credentials, stretching back days.\nThe admin had been right. \"Sure enough,” Duane says, “this was the tip of the iceberg.”\n\nOver the next several days, the security team at RSA’s security operations center—a NASAstyle control room with rows of desks and monitors covering one wall—meticulously traced\nthe interlopers’ fingerprints. The RSA staffers began putting in nearly 20-hour workdays,\ndriven by the chilling knowledge that the breach they were tracking was still unfolding.\nManagement demanded updates on their findings every four hours, day or night.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe analysts eventually traced the origin of the breach to a single malicious file that they\nbelieved had landed on an RSA employee’s PC five days before they’d started their hunt. A\nstaffer in Australia had received an email with the subject line “2011 Recruitment plan” and\nan Excel spreadsheet attached to it. He'd opened it. Inside the file was a script that exploited\na zero-day vulnerability—a secret, unpatched security flaw—in Adobe Flash, planting a\ncommon piece of malicious software called Poison Ivy on the victim’s machine.\n\nThat initial point of entry onto RSA’s network, F-Secure’s Hirvonen would later point out in his\nown analysis, wasn't particularly sophisticated. A hacker wouldn’t have even been able to\nexploit the Flash vulnerability if the victim had been running a more recent version of\nWindows or Microsoft Office, or if he’d had limited access to install programs on his PC—as\nmost security administrators for corporate and government networks recommend, Hirvonen\nsays.\n\nBut it was from this ingress that the RSA analysts say the intruders began to demonstrate\ntheir real abilities. In fact, several RSA executives came to believe that at least two groups of\nhackers were in their network simultaneously—one highly skilled group exploiting the other’s\naccess, perhaps, with or without their knowledge. “There’s the trail through the woods that\nthe first one left, and right in the middle of it, branching off, is the second trail,” says Sam\nCurry, who was RSA’s chief security officer at the time. “And that second attack was much\nmore skilled.”\n\nOn that Australian employee’s PC, someone had used a tool that pulled credentials out of\nthe machine's memory and then reused those usernames and passwords to log into other\nmachines on the network. They’d then scraped those computers’ memories for more\nusernames and passwords—finding some that belonged to more privileged administrators.\nThe hackers eventually got to a server containing hundreds of users’ credentials. Today that\ncredential-stealing hopscotching technique is common. But in 2011 the analysts were\nsurprised to see how the hackers fanned out across the network. “It was really just the most\nbrutal way to blow through our systems that I’d ever seen,” Duane says.\n\nBreaches as extensive as the one carried out against RSA are often discovered months after\nthe fact, when the intruders are long gone or lying dormant. But Duane says that the 2011\nincident was different: Within days, the investigators had essentially caught up to the\nintruders and were watching them in action. “They’d try to get into a system, then we’d detect\nthem a minute or two later and go in and shut down that system or disable access to it,”\nDuane says. “We were fighting them tooth and nail, in real time.”\n\nIt was in the midst of that feverish chase that Leetham caught the hackers stealing what he\nstill believes was their highest-priority target: the SecurID seeds.\n\nRSA executives told me that the part of their network responsible for manufacturing the\nSecurID hardware tokens was protected by an “air gap”—a total disconnection of computers\nfrom any machine that touches the internet. But in fact, Leetham says, one server on RSA’s\n\n\n-----\n\ninternet-connected network was linked, through a firewall that allowed no other connections,\nto the seed warehouse on the manufacturing side. Every 15 minutes, that server would pull\noff a certain number of seeds so that they could be encrypted, written to a CD, and given to\nSecurID customers. That link was necessary; it allowed RSA’s business side to help\ncustomers set up their own server that could then check users’ six-digit code when it was\ntyped into a login prompt. Even after the CD was shipped to a client, those seeds remained\non the seed warehouse server as a backup if the customer’s SecurID server or its setup CD\nwere somehow corrupted.\n\nNow, instead of the usual once-every-15-minutes connections, Leetham saw logs of\nthousands of continuous requests for data every second. What’s more, the hackers had\nbeen collecting those seeds on not one but three compromised servers, relaying requests\nthrough the one connected machine. They had packaged up the collection of seeds in three\nparts, moved them off to the faraway Rackspace server, and then recombined them into\nwhat appeared to be the full database of every seed RSA had stored in the seed warehouse.\n“I was like, ‘Wow,’” Leetham says. “I kind of admired it. But at the same time: ‘Oh crap.’”\n\nAs it dawned on Leetham that the seed collection had likely been copied—and after he had\nmade his seconds-too-late attempt to delete the data off the hackers’ server—the enormity of\nthe event hit him: The trust that customers placed in RSA, perhaps its most valuable\ncommodity, was about to be obliterated. “This is an extinction event,” he remembers thinking.\n“RSA is over.”\n\nIt was late at night when the security team learned that the seed warehouse had been\nplundered. Bill Duane made the call: They would physically cut off as many of RSA’s network\nconnections as necessary to limit the damage and stop any further theft of data. They hoped,\nin particular, to protect any customer information that mapped to the seeds, and which might\nbe necessary for the hackers to exploit them. (Some RSA staff also suggested to me that the\nseeds had been stored in an encrypted state, and cutting off network connections was\nintended to prevent the hackers from stealing the key necessary to decrypt them.) Duane\nand an IT manager walked into the data center and started unplugging Ethernet cables one\nby one, severing the company’s connections to its manufacturing facility, parts of its network\nthat handled core business processes like customer orders, even its website. “I basically\nshut off RSA’s business,” he says. “I crippled the company in order to stop any potential\nfurther release of data.”\n\nThe next day, RSA’s CEO, Art Coviello, was in a meeting in the conference room that\nadjoined his office, preparing a public statement about the ongoing breach. Coviello had\nbeen getting updates since the intrusions were discovered. As the extent of the breach had\ngrown, he’d canceled a business trip to Brazil. But he’d remained relatively sanguine. After\nall, it didn’t sound like the hackers had breached any credit card data or other sensitive\ncustomer information. They’d kick out the hackers, he figured, post their statement, and get\non with business.\n\n\n-----\n\nBut in the middle of the meeting, he remembers, a marketing executive at the table with him\nlooked at her phone and murmured, “Oh dear.”\n\nCoviello asked her what was wrong. She demurred. He took the phone out of her hand and\nread the message. It said that Bill Duane was coming up to Coviello’s office; he wanted to\nupdate the CEO in person. When he got upstairs, he delivered the news: The hackers had\nreached the SecurID seeds. “I felt like a cannonball had been shot through my stomach,”\nCoviello says.\n\nIn the hours that followed, RSA’s executives debated how to go public. One person in legal\nsuggested they didn’t actually need to tell their customers, Sam Curry remembers. Coviello\nslammed a fist on the table: They would not only admit to the breach, he insisted, but get on\nthe phone with every single customer to discuss how those companies could protect\nthemselves. Joe Tucci, the CEO of parent company EMC, quickly suggested they bite the\nbullet and replace all 40 million-plus SecurID tokens. But RSA didn’t have nearly that many\ntokens available—in fact, the breach would force it to shut down manufacturing. For weeks\nafter the hack, the company would only be able to restart production in a diminished\ncapacity.\n\nAs the recovery effort got under way, one executive suggested they call it Project Phoenix.\nCoviello immediately nixed the name. “Bullshit,” he remembers saying. “We're not rising from\nthe ashes. We're going to call this project Apollo 13. We're going to land the ship without\ninjury.”\n\nAt 7:00 the next morning, March 17, RSA’s head of North American sales, David Castignola,\nfinished up an early workout on a treadmill at his local gym in Detroit. When he picked up his\nphone, he saw that he had missed no fewer than 12 calls—all from just that morning, and all\nfrom RSA’s president, Tom Haiser. RSA, Haiser’s voicemails said, was about to announce a\nmajor security breach. He needed to be in the building.\n\nA few hours and a last-minute flight later, Castignola literally ran into RSA’s headquarters in\nBedford and up to the fourth-floor conference room. He immediately noticed the pale, drawn\nfaces of the staff who had been dealing with the unfolding crisis for more than a week. “Every\nlittle indicator I got was: This is worse than I can even get my head around,” Castignola\nremembers.\n\nThat afternoon, Coviello published an open letter to RSA’s customers on the company’s\nwebsite. “Recently, our security systems identified an extremely sophisticated cyberattack in\nprogress,” the letter read. “While at this time we are confident that the information extracted\ndoes not enable a successful direct attack on any of our RSA SecurID customers, this\ninformation could potentially be used to reduce the effectiveness of a current two-factor\nauthentication implementation as part of a broader attack,” the letter continued—somewhat\ndownplaying the crisis.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn Bedford, Castignola was given a conference room and the authority to ask for as many\nvolunteers from the company as he needed. A rotating group of nearly 90 staffers began the\nweeks-long, day-and-night process of arranging one-on-one phone calls with every\ncustomer. They worked from a script, walking customers through protective measures like\nadding or lengthening a PIN number as part of their SecurID logins, to make them harder for\nhackers to replicate. Castignola remembers walking down the halls of the building at 10 pm\nand hearing calls on speaker phones behind every closed door. In many cases customers\nwere shouting. Castignola, Curry, and Coviello each did hundreds of those calls; Curry\nbegan to joke that his title was “chief apology officer.”\n\nAt the same time, paranoia was beginning to take hold in the company. The first night after\nthe announcement, Castignola remembers walking by a wiring closet and seeing an absurd\nnumber of people walking out of it, far more than he imagined could have ever fit. “Who are\nthose people?” he asked another nearby executive. “That’s the government,” the executive\nresponded vaguely.\n\nIn fact, by the time Castignola had landed in Massachusetts, both the NSA and the FBI had\nbeen called to help the company’s investigation, as had defense contractor Northrop\nGrumman and incident response firm Mandiant. (By chance, employees of Mandiant had\nalready been on-site prior to the breach, installing security sensor equipment on RSA’s\nnetwork.)\n\nRSA staff began to take drastic measures. Worried that their phone system might be\ncompromised, the company switched carriers, moving from AT&T to Verizon phones.\nExecutives, not trusting even the new phones, held meetings in person and shared paper\ncopies of documents. The FBI, fearing an accomplice in RSA's ranks because of the\napparent level of knowledge the intruders seemed to have of company systems, started\ndoing background checks. “I made sure that all members of the team—I don't care who they\nwere, what reputation they had—were investigated, because you have to be sure,” Duane\nsays.\n\nThe windows of some executives’ offices and conference rooms were covered in layers of\nbutcher paper, to prevent laser microphone surveillance—a long-distance eavesdropping\ntechnique that picks up conversations from vibrations in window panes—by imagined spies\nin the surrounding woods. The building was swept for bugs. Multiple executives insisted that\nthey did find hidden listening devices—though some were so old that their batteries were\ndead. It was never clear if those bugs had any relation to the breach.\n\nMeanwhile, RSA’s security team and the investigators brought in to help were “tearing the\nhouse down to the studs,” as Curry put it. In every part of the network that the hackers\ntouched, he says, they scrubbed the contents of potentially compromised machines—and\neven ones adjacent to them. “We physically went around and, if there was a box they were\non, it got wiped,” Curry says. “If you lost data, too bad.”\n\n\n-----\n\nIn late May 2011, about two months after the breach announcement, RSA was still\nrecovering, rebuilding, and apologizing to customers when it was hit with an aftershock: A\n[post appeared on the influential tech blogger Robert X. Cringely’s website, titled “InsecureID:](https://www.cringely.com/2011/05/25/insecureid-no-more-secrets/)\nNo More Secrets?”\n\nThe post was based on a tip from a source inside a major defense contractor, who’d told\nCringely that the company was responding to an extensive intrusion by hackers who seemed\nto have used stolen RSA seed values to get in. Everyone at the defense contractor was\nhaving their RSA tokens replaced. Suddenly RSA's breach seemed far more severe than the\ncompany’s original announcement had described it. “Well it didn’t take long for whoever\ncracked RSA to find a lock to fit that key,” Cringely wrote. “What if every RSA token has been\ncompromised, everywhere?”\n\nTwo days later, [Reuters revealed the name of the hacked military contractor: Lockheed](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-hackers/exclusive-hackers-breached-u-s-defense-contractors-idUSTRE74Q6VY20110527)\nMartin, a company that represented a cornucopia of ultra-secret plans for weapons and\nintelligence technologies. “The scab was healing,” Castignola says. “Then Lockheed hit. That\nwas like a mushroom cloud. We were back at it again.”\n\nIn the days that followed, defense contractors Northrop Grumman and L-3 were also named\nin news reports. Hackers with SecurID’s seed values had targeted them too, the stories said,\nthough it was never clear how deeply the intruders had penetrated the companies. Nor was it\nrevealed what the hackers had accessed inside Lockheed Martin. The company claimed it\nhad prevented the spies from stealing sensitive information like customer data or classified\nsecrets.\n\nIn another open letter to customers in early June 2011, RSA’s Art Coviello admitted, “We\nwere able to confirm that information taken from RSA in March had been used as an element\nof an attempted broader attack on Lockheed Martin, a major US government defense\ncontractor.”\n\nToday, with 10 years of hindsight, Coviello and other former RSA executives tell a story that\nstarkly contradicts accounts from the time: Most of the former RSA staff who spoke to me\nclaim that it was never proven that SecurID had any role in the Lockheed breach. Coviello,\nCurry, Castignola, and Duane all argued that it was never confirmed that the intruders inside\nRSA’s systems had successfully stolen the full list of seed values in an uncorrupted,\nunencrypted form, nor the customer list mapped to those seeds necessary to exploit them. “I\ndon't think that Lockheed’s attack was related to us at all,” Coviello states flatly.\n\nBy contrast, in the years since 2011, [Lockheed Martin has detailed how hackers used](https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/how-lockheed-martins-kill-chain-stopped-securid-attack/d/d-id/1139125)\ninformation stolen in RSA’s SecurID breach as a stepping stone to penetrate its network—\neven as it insists that no information was successfully stolen in that event. A Lockheed\nsource with knowledge of the company’s incident response reaffirmed to WIRED the\ncompany’s original claims. “We stand by our forensic investigation findings,” the source says.\n“Our analysis determined the breach of our two-factor authentication token provider was a\n\n\n-----\n\ndirect contributing factor in the attack on our network, a fact that has been widely reported by\nthe media and acknowledged publicly by our vendor, including Art.” In fact, the Lockheed\nsource says the company saw the hackers entering SecurID codes in real time, confirmed\nthat the targeted users hadn’t lost their tokens, and then, after replacing those users’ tokens,\nwatched the hackers continue to unsuccessfully enter codes from the old tokens.\n\nThe NSA, for its part, has never had much doubt about RSA’s role in subsequent break-ins.\nIn a [briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee a year after the RSA breach, NSA’s](https://www.airforcemag.com/PDF/SiteCollectionDocuments/Reports/2012/March2012/Day28/032812alexander.pdf)\ndirector, General Keith Alexander, said that the RSA hack “led to at least one US defense\ncontractor being victimized by actors wielding counterfeit credentials,” and that the\nDepartment of Defense had been forced to replace every RSA token it used.\n\nIn the hearing, Alexander went on to pin those attacks, vaguely, on an increasingly common\n[culprit: China. The New York Times and the](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/technology/chinas-army-is-seen-as-tied-to-hacking-against-us.html) [security firm Mandiant would later publish a](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf)\ngroundbreaking exposé on a Chinese state hacker group that Mandiant had named APT1.\nThe group was believed to be People’s Liberation Army Unit 61398, based on the outskirts of\nShanghai. Among its dozens of targets over the previous five years: the governments of the\nUnited States, Canada, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam; and the United Nations—and RSA.\n\nAfter those reports became public, Bill Duane printed out a picture of the hackers’\nheadquarters, a 12-story white building off of Shanghai’s Datong Road. He taped it to a\ndartboard in his office.\n\nI asked Duane, who retired from RSA in 2015 after more than 20 years at the company, at\nwhat point he considered RSA’s breach truly over: Was it the morning after he made the\nlonely decision to unplug a chunk of the company’s network? Or when the NSA, the FBI,\nMandiant, and Northrop had wrapped up and left? “Our view was that the attack wasn’t ever\nover,” he responds. “We knew that they left backdoors, that they’re always going to be able\nto break in, that the attacker can, with their resources, get in when they want to get in.”\n\nDuane’s harrowing experience in response to the intrusion taught him—and perhaps should\nteach all of us—that “every network is dirty,” as he puts it. Now he preaches to companies\nthat they should segment their systems and cordon off their most sensitive data so that it\nremains impenetrable even to an adversary that’s already inside the firewall.\n\nAs for Todd Leetham, he watched the SolarWinds fiasco unfold over the past six months with\na grim sense of déjà vu. “Everybody was shocked. But in hindsight, well, duh, it was kind of\neverywhere,” he says of SolarWinds. As was, by analogy, SecurID, 10 years earlier.\n\nLeetham sees the lessons of RSA’s supply chain compromise in starker terms than even his\ncolleague Bill Duane: It was “a glimpse of just how fragile the world is,” he says. “It’s a house\nof cards during a tornado warning.”\n\n\n-----\n\nSolarWinds demonstrated how precarious this structure remains, he argues. As Leetham\nsees it, the security world blindly put its trust in something that existed outside its threat\nmodel, never imagining that an adversary might attack it. And once again, the adversary\npulled out a supporting card underpinning the house’s foundation—one that had been\nconfused for solid ground.\n\n_Let us know what you think about this article.
