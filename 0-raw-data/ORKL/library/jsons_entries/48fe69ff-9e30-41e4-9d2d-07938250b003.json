The breach, which came to light in February 2015, is believed to be the work of a well- resourced cyberespionage group which Symantec calls Black Vine.\n\n Anthem wasn’t Black Vine’s only target. Black Vine has been actively conducting its campaigns since 2012 and has been targeting several industries, including aerospace, energy, and healthcare. The group has access to zero-day exploits distributed through the Elderwood framework and has used these exploits as the same time that other advanced attack groups have, such as Hidden Lynx.\n\n Black Vine typically conducts watering-hole attacks against websites that are relevant to its targets’ interests and uses zero-day exploits to compromise computers. If the exploits succeed, then they drop variants of Black Vine’s custom-developed malware: Hurix and Sakurel (both detected as Trojan.Sakurel), and Mivast (detected as Backdoor.Mivast). These threats open a back door on the compromised computers and allow the attackers to steal valuable information.\n\n Based on our own analysis of the campaigns, along with support from open-source data, Symantec believes that some actors of Black Vine may be associated with an IT security organization based in Beijing called Topsec.\n\n\n-----\n\n### INTRODUCTION\n\n## The discovery of the database queries soon led Anthem to realize that it was under attack from an advanced cyberespionage group.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Introduction\n\nOn January 26, 2014, a systems administrator for the major healthcare provider Anthem discovered that their\naccount had been compromised to access sensitive data from an internal database. Multiple queries had been\nrun from the account, but the system administrator realized that someone else had executed the queries.\nThe discovery of the database queries soon led Anthem to realize that it was under attack from an advanced\ncyberespionage group. This attack is believed to be the largest healthcare data breach to date, resulting in the\n[theft of over 80 million records. Symantec refers to the group behind the attack as Black Vine.](http://www.zdnet.com/article/health-insurer-anthem-hit-by-hackers-up-to-80-million-records-exposed/)\n\nDetails of the breach emerged in early February 2015, when the public learned of the magnitude of the attack\nagainst the US’ second largest healthcare provider. The breach, conducted by Black Vine, has been one of the\nmost highly publicized and reported attacks so far in 2015. However, this was only one of several of Black Vine’s\ntargeted campaigns, which spread across multiple industries.\n\nSince 2012, Black Vine has been conducting targeted attacks against multiple industries, including the energy,\naerospace, and healthcare sectors. The group uses advanced custom-developed malware, zero-day exploits, and\nother tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) typically associated with highly capable, organized attackers.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to document all of Black Vine’s known attacks, beginning in 2012 and continuing\nto present day. Connecting multiple Black Vine campaigns over time not only shows the group’s previous\noperations, but also demonstrates how the adversary has evolved. The intent of this report is to help\norganizations better understand Black Vine, including its TTPs, motivations, and its use of unique malware, and\ndefend themselves against this threat.\n\n#### Key findings\n\nAfter researching Black Vine’s attacks over time, Symantec identified the following key findings:\n\n**• Black Vine is responsible for carrying out cyberespionage campaigns against multiple industries, including**\nenergy, aerospace, and healthcare.\n\n**• Black Vine conducts watering-hole attacks targeting legitimate energy- and aerospace-related websites to**\ncompromise the sites’ visitors with custom malware.\n\n**[• Black Vine appears to have access to the Elderwood framework, which is used to distribute zero-day exploits](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/the-elderwood-project.pdf)**\namong threat groups that specialize in cyberespionage.\n\n**• Black Vine uses custom-developed malware and has resources to frequently update and modify its malware to**\navoid detection.\n\nThe findings documented in this report lead Symantec to believe that Black Vine is an attack group with working\nrelationships with multiple cyberespionage actors. The group is well funded, organized, and comprises of at\nleast a few members, some of which may have a past or present association with a China-based IT security\norganization called Topsec.\n\n\n-----\n\n### TARGETS\n\n## Black Vine frequently conducts  watering-hole attacks, which is when a legitimate website is compromised by an attacker and forced to serve malware to visitors of the website.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Targets\n\nOver the course of the Black Vine investigation, Symantec identified a number of targeted companies across\nseveral verticals. Analysis of attack data alone is misleading, due to Black Vine’s attack vectors. Black Vine\nfrequently conducts watering-hole attacks, which is when a legitimate website is compromised by an attacker\nand forced to serve malware to visitors of the website. As a result, an analysis of compromised computers alone\ndoes not portray an accurate picture of Black Vine’s targeting objectives. Instead, this shows us the industries\nwith the highest infection rates of Black Vine’s malware.\n\nBased on an analysis of\nSymantec’s telemetry\ndata, the following\nindustries have been\naffected by Black Vine’s\nactivity:\n\n**• Aerospace**\n\n**• Healthcare**\n\n**• Energy (specifically,**\ngas and electric\nturbine manufacturers)\n\n**• Military and defense**\n\n**• Finance**\n\n**• Agriculture**\n\n**• Technology**\n\nTo further determine\nBlack Vine’s intended\ntarget industries,\nSymantec assessed\nthe companies who\nown the affected\nwebsites. Symantec also\ninvestigated attacks\nbelieved to have been _Figure 1. Black Vine victims by region_\nconducted by Black Vine\nwhich didn’t involve\nwatering-hole attacks. After assessing multiple attack verticals, Symantec believes that Black Vine’s primary\ntargeted industries have been aerospace and healthcare. It is likely that other industries that were affected by\nthese attacks may have been secondary targets.\n\nBlack Vine’s targets are spread across several regions, based on the IP address locations of the compromised\ncomputers. The vast majority of infections affected companies in the US, followed by China, Canada, Italy,\nDenmark, and India.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Attackers’ resources\n\nBlack Vine appears to have access to a wide variety of resources to let it conduct multiple simultaneous attacks\nover a sustained period of time. These resources include the development of custom malware, access to\nzero-day exploits, and attacker-owned infrastructure. Funding and resourcing for sustained cyberespionage\ncampaigns against such a breadth targets can only be obtained through large public entities or privately owned\norganizations.\n\nOur analysis showed three major variants of Black Vine’s custom malware used in activity that we attribute\nto the attack group. The three variants of custom-developed malware are known as Hurix and Sakurel (both\n[detected as Trojan.Sakurel), and Mivast (Backdoor.Mivast). These variants are believed to have been created by](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-022401-3212-99)\nthe same malware author(s) and use some of the same code and resources. For example, Hurix and Sakurel have\nthe following similarities:\n\n**• Both Hurix and Sakurel gather the computer name of the target and encrypt data using the same algorithm.**\n\n**• This algorithm uses division and addition with static variables 1Ah and 61h. The location of the algorithm in**\neach threat is as follows:\n```\n            o Hurix: 402A75h\n            o Sakurel: 1000147Bh\n\n```\n**• Similar data and parameters exist in the network communication parameters:**\n```\n            o Both variants use the parameter “type” which is initialized with zero value.\n            o Both variants use a parameter that contains the same data, as seen below:\n\n```\n                  - Hurix: cookie=iztkctcebtgbbyf-2135928347 (where “cookie” is the parameter,\n“iztkctcebtgbbyf” is the encrypted computer name, and “-2135928347” is the decimal\nequivalent of the hard disk serial number)\n\n                 - Sakurel: imageid=iztkctcebtgbbyf-2135928347 (where “imageid” is the parameter,\n“iztkctcebtgbbyf” is the encrypted computer name, and “-2135928347” is the decimal\nequivalent of the hard disk serial number)\n\nAll three variants of Black Vine’s malware have the following capabilities:\n\n**• Open a pipe back door**\n\n**• Execute files and commands**\n\n**• Delete, modify, and create registry keys**\n\n**• Gather and transmit information about the infected computer**\n\nThe following unique traits were identified in the URL patterns seen in network communication requests\nbetween the malware and command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure from each variant:\n\n**• photoid=**\n\n**• resid=**\n\n**• imageid=**\n\n**• vid=**\n\nFor example:\n\n**• www.polarroute.com/newimage.asp/imageid=oonftwwtwwtzx1755999261&type=0&resid=139890**\n\n**• www.polarroute.com/viewphoto.asp/resid=126546&photoid=oonftwwtwwtzx1755999261**\n\nIn most cases, the malware is made to look like a technology-related application. Some of the themes used to\ndisguise the malware include Media Center, VPN, and Citrix applications. The C&C server or malware-hosting\ndomain is also themed similarly to the malware’s disguise. For example, in one instance, a Sakurel sample was\nnamed MediaCenter.exe (MD5:1240fbbabd76110a8fC&C9803e0c3ccfb). The C&C domain that the malware\ncommunicated with used a Citrix theme: citrix.vipreclod.com\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, most of the analyzed malware samples have been digitally signed by Korean software company\nDTOPTOOLZ Co or embedded software product developer MICRO DIGITAL INC. Symantec has observed that the\nDTOPTOOLZ Co certificate has been used to sign a malicious binary in adware and malvertising campaigns which\nare unrelated to Black Vine activity. Both of the digital certificates previously used to sign Black Vine’s malware\nhave either expired or been revoked. The details on both of the certificates are as shown in Figures 2 and 3.\n\n_Figure 2. DTOPTOOLZ CO digital certificate details_\n\n_Figure 3. MICRO DIGITAL INC. digital certificate details_\n\n\n-----\n\n### CAMPAIGNS\n\n## In all of the investigated Black Vine campaigns, the primary objective has been to gain access to their targets’ infrastructure and steal information.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Campaigns\n\nThe earliest known attack that Symantec attributes to Black Vine began in 2012. Since then, Symantec has\nobserved Black Vine conducting multiple targeted campaigns. In all of the investigated Black Vine campaigns,\nthe primary objective has been to gain access to their targets’ infrastructure and steal information.\n##### Energy\n\n[In late December 2012, security researcher Eric Romang published a blog, reporting that gas turbine](http://eromang.zataz.com/2013/01/02/capstone-turbine-corporation-also-targeted-in-the-cfr-watering-hole-attack-and-more)\nmanufacturer Capstone Turbine became a victim of a watering-hole attack. Symantec’s investigation confirmed\nRomang’s findings that during the attack, Capstone Turbine’s legitimate domain, capstoneturbine.com, was\n[serving an exploit for a zero-day bug known as the Microsoft Internet Explorer ‘CDwnBindInfo’ Use-After-Free](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/57070)\n[Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-4792). Users who browsed Capstone’s website using vulnerable](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/57070)\nversions of Internet Explorer at the time were ultimately compromised with the Sakurel payload. Sakurel\nprovided Black Vine with access to the compromised computers and their information. As previously mentioned,\nthe Sakurel sample seen in this attack was digitally signed by MICRO DIGITAL INC.\n\nDetails about the Sakurel malware samples associated with the attack are as follows:\n\n**• MD5 hash: 61fe6f4cb2c54511f0804b1417ab3bd2**\n\n**• C&C domain: web.viprclod.com**\n\n**• Vulnerability: CVE-2012-4792**\n\n**• Compile time: December 8, 2012 07:54:44**\n\nAdditionally, the C&C domain used in the attack, webvipr.clod.com, may be a typo-squat domain designed to\npose as the legitimate domain VipeCloud.com. The legitimate website belongs to VipeCloud, which provides\nsales and marketing automation as a service. This could be a coincidence or re-used infrastructure from other\nunknown attacks. However, the domain was registered on December 10, 2012, just two days after the Sakurel\nsamples that were used in energy-related attacks were compiled. Regardless, the C&C server theme is not\nconstant with themes we would expect to see with energy-related targets.\n\nThe following information was used to register the attacker’s C&C domain viprclod.com on December 10, 2012:\n\n**• Domain name: VIPRECLOD.COM**\n\n**• Created on: 10-Dec-12**\n\n**• Expires on: 10-Dec-13**\n\n**• Last Updated on: 10-Dec-12**\n\n**• Administrative contact:**\n```\n            o moon, today todaymoon321@gmail.com\n            o xingfudadao\n            o sitemo, ai no 236963\n            o Tanzania\n\n```\nCapstone Turbine is a US-based gas turbine manufacturer which specializes in micro turbine power along\nwith heating and cooling cogeneration systems. Capstone Turbine’s intellectual property in the research and\ndevelopment of energy and power technologies is likely what made it a target for cyberespionage.\n\nOn December 24, 2012, Black Vine targeted a second turbine power and technology manufacturer. While the\ndetails of this attack cannot be publicly disclosed, Sakurel was also used in this attack. Considering how Back\nVine conducted multiple waves of zero-day attacks and targeted turbine manufacturers, it’s likely that the attack\ngroup’s primary targeted industries at the time were involved in energy-related technologies.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Aerospace\n\n[In mid-2013, a third-party blog documented how a Citrix-themed lure was used in targeted attacks against a](http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/495631-citrix-apps-used-as-lure-in-targeted-attack-against-global-airline)\nglobal airline to deliver the Hurix malware. According to the blog, the malware was delivered through spear-\nphishing emails sent to specific employees at the airline. The emails included a URL that directed the user to\ndownload Hurix to their computer. Unfortunately, Symantec did not have access to the data needed to validate\nthe claims made in the blog. We are including a high-level summarization of the attack for documentation\npurposes.\n\nIn February 2014, Black Vine compromised the website of a European aerospace company. The attackers gained\naccess to the organization’s domain and leveraged its home page to compromise the website’s visitors. The\nwatering-hole attack was likely conducted to target more people in the aerospace industry. Similar to the attacks\n[against energy-related targets in 2012, the attackers exploited a new zero-day bug known as the Microsoft](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/65551)\n[Internet Explorer Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2014-0322). The payload of the](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/65551)\nattack was an updated version of Sakurel. Details on the Sakurel sample identified in the attack are as follows:\n\n**• MD5 hash: c869c75ed1998294af3c676bdbd56851**\n\n**[• C&C domain: oa.ameteksen.com](http://rats.gist.symantec.com/rats/trait/6611189)**\n\n**• Vulnerability: CVE-2014-0322**\n\n**• Compile time: July 16, 2013 03:44:36**\n\nOnce the victim was infected, Sakurel made the following network call to the C&C domain oa.ameteksen.com:\n```\n           GET /script.asp?resid=93324828&nmsg=del&photoid=iztkctcebtgbbyf-2135928347\n           HTTP/1.1\n\n```\nThe C&C domain ameteksen.com was registered with the following details:\n\n**• Domain name: AMETEKSEN.COM**\n\n**• Registrar URL: http://www.godaddy.com**\n\n**• Updated date: 2013-10-15 05:15:20**\n\n**• Creation date: 2013-10-15 05:06:32**\n\n**• Registrar expiration date: 2014-10-15 05:06:32**\n\n**• Registrar: GoDaddy.com, LLC**\n\n**• Registrant country: China**\n\n**• Name: ghregjr ngrjekg**\n\n**• Street: kwjfhrjkgh**\n\n**• City: rjekteyu**\n\n**• State/Province:**\n\n**• Postal code: 37182**\n\n**• Country: China**\n\n**• Phone: +86.3781263856**\n\n**• Email: dobbin.pacheco@aol.com**\n\nBlack Vine likely created the domain ameteksen.com to disguise it as the legitimate ameteksensors.com or\nametek.com, owned by aerospace and defense contractor Ametek.\n\nDuring our investigation of Black Vine’s aerospace-related attacks, Symantec discovered that the group used an\nunusual tactic. After the Sakurel payload was initially run on the victim’s computer, the malware made changes\nto the victim’s host file. The host file is normally used by the Windows operating system as a mechanism to\nstatically map a domain to an IP address, rather than using a network-based domain name system (DNS) lookup.\nOddly, Black Vine’s modifications to the host file added static entries resolving the legitimate domains to their\nlegitimate IP addresses.\n\nAltering a host file to map a domain to its legitimate IP address is unusual, because the default DNS requests\nwould provide the same mapping. This type of tactic would usually be seen in instances where an attacker\nwanted to redirect a legitimate domain to their own malicious infrastructure in order to steal credentials or\ninfect the target with additional malware. However, altering the host file on the infected computer could allow\nthe victim to discover that their computer had been compromised.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Table 1.

During the time of this investigation, the gifas.asso.net domain was being used to deliver\nmalware and the referring page was www.savmpet .com.\n\nThe numbers of concurrent attacks conducted by Black Vine against organizations within the aerospace industry\nare unknown. However, Symantec assesses with moderate confidencebelieves that multiple targeted campaigns\ntook place in early to mid-2014. Targeted cyberespionage operations against aerospace-related organizations\nwith custom malware and the use of zero-day exploits fit the TTPs typically associated with a well-funded public\nor private organization attacker.\n\n##### Healthcare\n\nIn February 2015, a major cyberespionage campaign targeting the healthcare industry was publicly disclosed.\nThe breach involved healthcare company Anthem, which was affected by an attack that led to the exposure of\nover 80 million patient records. Initial reports claimed that Anthem identified the breach on January 26, 2015,\nwhen a system administrator discovered that a database query had been run with their own credentials without\ntheir knowledge. Shortly after this discovery, Anthem realized the magnitude of the breach, which likely began in\nMay 2014. Based on the samples analyzed in our investigation, Symantec identified that the Black Vine malware\nvariant known as Mivast was used in the\nAnthem breach. Other third-part vendors _Table 2.

It is likely that the threat was delivered through spear-phishing emails, since a watering-\nhole attack was never seen or reported in the breach. The malware itself was disguised using Citrix and Juniper\nVPN lures, indicating that the initial attack may have been aimed at Anthem’s technical staff.\n\n#### Who is behind Black Vine?\n\nWe analyzed the group’s infrastructure, resources, and attack patterns in order to find out who the Black Vine\nattackers could be and what their motivations are. We also researched open source data, which suggests that\nsome actors of Black Vine may be associated with a Beijing-based company known as Topsec.\n\n##### Topsec association\n\n[A blog from Threat Connect noted that the registration information for infrastructure used in the Anthem](http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-hack-all-roads-lead-to-china/)\nbreach leads back to a Chinese origin. Infrastructure associated with the Mivast malware sample (MD5:230D8\nA7A60A07DF28A291B13DDF3351F) seen in the Anthem attacks resolved to IP address 192.199.254.126. The\ndomain topsec2014.com\nwas one of only a few\ndomains hosted on this\nIP address close to the\nsame time frame that\nMivast accessed C&C\ninfrastructure hosted on\nthe same IP address.\n\nThe topsec2014.\ncom domain can be\ntraced back to the\nregistrant address\ntopsec2014@163.com,\nwhich is believed to\nbe associated with the\nsimilar email address\nTopSec_2014@163.com.\nThe topsec2014 domain\nand the previously\nmentioned email\naddresses are associated\nwith an organization\ncalled Topsec.\n\nTopsec is a company _Figure 4. Details on the Topsec Network Security & Technology Company_\nthat began as a research\ninstitute in Beijing and\nhas since expanded to nearly every province of China. The organization focuses on security research, training,\nauditing, and products. Its customers include private businesses as well as public agencies. It also hosts an\nannual hacking competition known as the Topsec Cup and has reportedly hired known hackers to provide\nsecurity services and training.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Zero-day access and distribution\n\nMultiple Black Vine campaigns have exploited previously unknown zero-day vulnerabilities to deliver the group’s\ncustom payload. Zero-day exploits typically require attackers to have an advanced skillset to identify and then\ndetermine how to exploit the unheard-of vulnerability. Generally, these exploits can be purchased through\nunderground networks or may be created by specialized exploit developers. Both approaches require access to\nextensive financial resources.\n\nIn the case of Black Vine, Symantec has identified a pattern between this attack group’s activity and other\ncyberespionage-related campaigns. These campaigns were seen using the same zero-day exploits but delivering\na different payload. There appears to be shared access to zero-day exploits, which are distributed and used\nwithin days of one another among different attack groups, as the diagram in Figure 5 shows.\n\n###### Concurrent CVE-2012-4792 zero-day exploits\n\nIn late December 2012, the Council on Foreign Relations’ (CFR) website was compromised. The domain was\nreported as serving an exploit against an unknown vulnerability found in Internet Explorer 6, which was\neventually labelled CVE-2012-4792. At the time of exploitation, there was no patch or remediation in place for\nthe vulnerability, leaving victims using the vulnerable version of Internet Explorer helpless. Once the unpatched\n[vulnerability was exploited, the attackers delivered a variant of Backdoor.Bifrose to the victim’s computer. Based](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2004-101214-5358-99)\non Symantec’s previous findings, Bifrose has been associated with another cyberespionage campaign. Symantec\ndoes not believe that either this adversary or the CFR compromise is associated with Black Vine.\n\n_Figure 5. Zero-day distribution and framework_\n\nAs mentioned previously in this report, in December 2012, the Capstone Turbine website was compromised by\nBlack Vine. Based on the first known instances where malicious code was spotted on both the CFR and Capstone\nwebsites, the attacks began on or around the same week as one another.\n\nIn both website compromises, the domains were serving exploits against the same Internet Explorer zero-day\n\n\n-----\n\nvulnerability (CVE-2012-4792). The primary difference between the attacks was that the Sakurel payload was\ndelivered in the Capstone attack while Bifrose was distributed in the CFR attack.\n\n###### Concurrent CVE-2014-0322 zero-day exploits\n\nIn February 2014, there was another instance of two attack groups sharing the use of a zero-day exploit to\ndeliver different payloads. Between February 11 and February 15, 2014, the websites of the US Veterans of\nForeign Wars (VFW.org) and the home page of a large European aerospace manufacturer both became victims of\nwatering-hole attacks. Similar to the 2012 attacks, the sites were forced to redirect to an exploit for a previously\nunknown zero-day vulnerability in Internet Explorer (CVE-2014-0322) in order to deliver a malicious payload.\n[In the VFW.org attack, the delivered payload was a variant of Backdoor.Moudoor. Moudoor has been used in](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-100817-2451-99)\n[targeted attacks by a group previously reported by Symantec, referred as Hidden Lynx. The attack against](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/hidden_lynx.pdf)\nthe aerospace manufacturer took place simultaneously with the VFW attack and exploited the same zero-day\nvulnerability. The payload in the aerospace watering-hole attack was Black Vine’s Sakurel malware.\n\n###### Elderwood link\n\nThe simultaneous attacks between different attack groups seen in 2012 and 2014 exploited the same zero-day\nvulnerabilities at the same time, but delivered different malware. The malware used in these campaigns are\nbelieved to be unique and customized to each group. However, the concurrent use of exploits suggests a shared\naccess to zero-day exploits between all of these groups. Symantec has previously identified the platform that\n[has been used to deliver zero-day exploits to multiple attack groups as the Elderwood framework.](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/the-elderwood-project.pdf)\n\nPrevious attacks exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities sourced from the Elderwood framework are believed to have\noriginated from attackers based in China.\n\n##### Attribution\n\nBlack Vine appears to have access to resources to develop and update its own custom malware, and obtain\nzero-day exploits for its targeted attacks. This access and capability suggest that Black Vine is well funded and\nresourced. Black Vine’s continuous campaigns against targeted industries, beginning in late 2012, fit the TTPs\nassociated with organized cyberespionage actors.\n\nCertain Black Vine infrastructure seems to be associated with the Beijing-based security organization Topsec.\nThe relationship with Black Vine and Topsec provides evidence of the past or present geography of at least some\nactors involved in this group’s activity.\n\nAccess to the Elderwood framework is another indicator that Black Vine is in working relationships with actors\nassociated with widely reported cyberespionage attacks over the past several years. Along with this, Black Vine\nhas been observed using Elderwood-distributed zero-day exploits simultaneously with other threat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\n## Many of the campaigns analyzed by Symantec have been targeted attacks against the energy, aerospace, healthcare, and other industries.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nBlack Vine has been conducting its attacks since at least 2012. Many of the campaigns analyzed by Symantec\nhave been targeted attacks against the energy, aerospace, healthcare, and other industries. Black Vine\nused three variants of malware throughout the years known as Hurix, Sakurel, and Mivast. All three variants\noriginated from one malware family that was likely created and updated by the same author or developer. Each\nvariant has been updated to add features and is re-hashed to avoid detection.\n\nIn a number of attacks, the malware has been delivered onto the victim’s computer after Black Vine has\nexploited a zero-day vulnerability primarily through watering-hole attacks. The zero-day exploits used in these\nattacks are believed to have been distributed through the Elderwood distribution framework. Additionally, the\ngoal of all analyzed Black Vine campaigns has been cyberespionage.\n\nThe Anthem attack is one the most publicized and damaging attacks against the US health industry. However,\nthe healthcare industry is only one of several large cyberespionage-based campaigns conducted by Black\nVine. As outlined in the findings of our investigation, Black Vine has also attacked the aerospace and energy\nindustries. By investigating and documenting the TTPs, malware, targets, and exploits used in these attacks over\ntime, Symantec hopes to shed light on the history of the Black Vine attack group.\n\nSymantec’s goal in creating this report is to provide an assessment of this attack group to help organizations\nbetter understand the attackers and their motivations. Knowing the signs to identify Black Vine’s activity will\nhelp analysts build better defenses and allow decision-makers to react to Black Vine attacks more effectively.\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nSymantec
