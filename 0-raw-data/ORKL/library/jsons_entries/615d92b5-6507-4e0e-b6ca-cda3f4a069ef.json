    "plain_text": "Spamhaus tracks both Internet Protocol (IP)\naddresses and domain names used by\nthreat actors for hosting botnet command\n& control (C&C) servers. This data enables\nus to identify associated elements,\nincluding the geolocation of the botnet\nC&Cs, the malware associated with\nthem, the top-level domains used when\nregistering a domain for a botnet C&C,\nthe sponsoring registrars and the network\nhosting the botnet C&C infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Spotlight\n## A sitting duck? Qakbot’s demise\n\nIn Q3 a takedown operation, called “Duck Hunt”\noccurred, taking control of Qakbot’s infrastructure, and\nmetaphorically shooting down this malevolent malware.\n\n\n### Qakbot refresher\n\n\nFor those of you who are not overly familiar with the\nQakbot malware, here are some key points to digest:\n\n- \u0007Qakbot was Bad, with a capital B, and seen as one of\nthe most significant threats to corporate networks.\n\n- \u0007In 2022, every fourth malware site shared by\n[contributors to abuse.ch’s URLHaus platform was](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/)\nassociated with Qakbot – this malware was prolific.\n\n- \u0007Qakbot’s usual modus operandi was in providing\ninitial access to a network for groups to then deploy\nransomware, such as Conti, ProLock, Egregor and REvil.\n\n- \u0007Investigators have found evidence that, between\nOctober 2021 and April 2023, Qakbot administrators\nreceived fees corresponding to approximately $58\nmillion in ransoms paid by victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n### The takedown\n\n\nOn Tuesday August 29th, 2023, the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI), coordinating an international group\nof law enforcement authorities, announced that it had\ntaken control of the Qakbot infrastructure.\n\nIn a cunning move, through Bureau-controlled servers,\nthe FBI instructed infected computers to download an\nuninstaller file. This uninstaller, specifically created to\nremove Qakbot malware, untethered infected computers\nfrom the botnet and prevented the installation of any\nadditional malware.\n\n\n### It takes a community to keep the internet safe\n\n\nAs part of the remediation efforts, The Spamhaus Project\nwas more than happy to be able to assist the FBI and\nthe international coalition. Through data shared by these\nentities, we were able to contact email service providers,\nhosting companies, and other parties responsible for\nemail accounts that had been compromised by Qakbot.\nThe request was a simple one “please secure the\naccounts in question via a simple password reset.”\n\nOut of the 6.3 million email addresses that had been\nshared with Spamhaus by the FBI, approximately 50%\nwere downloaded for remediation.\n\n\n### Will the duck remain down?\n\n\nWho knows. Given that the perpetrators behind Qakbot\nhaven’t been arrested, we may well see it rise from the\nashes. Nonetheless, we applaud the work that this crossborder coalition, led by the FBI, has done – as ever it\nhighlights that it takes a global community to make the\ninternet a safer place.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Number of botnet C&Cs observed,  Q3 2023\n\nIn Q3 2023, Spamhaus identified 7,052 botnet C&Cs\ncompared to 8,438 in Q2 2023. This was a -16% decrease\nquarter on quarter. The monthly average reduced from\n\n**What are botnet command**\n\n2,813 in Q2 to 2,351 botnet C&Cs per month in Q3 2023.\n\n**& controllers?**\n\nA ‘botnet controller,’ ‘botnet C2’ or\n\n**Quarter** **No. of Botnets** **Quarterly Average** **% Change** ‘botnet command & control’ server\n\nQ4 2022 6,775 2,258 +56% is commonly abbreviated to ‘botnet\n\nC&C.’ Fraudsters use these to both\n\nQ1 2023 8,358 2,786 +23% control malware-infected machines\n\nQ2 2023 8,438 2,813 +1% and extract personal and valuable\n\ndata from malware-infected victims.\n\nQ3 2023 7,052 2,351 -16%\n\n\n-----\n\n## Geolocation of botnet C&Cs,  Q3 2023\n\n### China knocks the US off pole position \n\nThose increases keep coming for China.

Last quarter the numbers increased by a further\n18%, to 1,570, knocking the US off its #1 position;\na position the US had held for a year.\n\n\n### Decreases across the globe\n\n\nExcept for the previously mentioned China, along with\nSaudi Arabia (+13%), the Netherlands (+8%), Singapore\n(+7%) and India (2%), all other regions experienced a\ndecrease in the number of botnet C&Cs.

With .makeup, .beauty, and\n.hair all in the Top 10 list, we assume that a special offer\n\n**a brief overview**\n\nrun by the registry .xyz was too much of a lure for bad\nactors to purchase these domains for their botnet C&Cs.\nNevertheless, it’s not all bad news for this registry; .xyz\n\n**Generic TLDs (gTLDs)**\n\nitself dropped out of the Top 20, which we congratulate.\n\n### New ccTLD entry\n\nHaving seen a plethora of country code TLDs depart\nfrom the Top 20, following Freenom’s demise, it’s\ndisappointing to see a new entry to the charts: .pw.\n\nOriginally, this ccTLD was reserved for the residents\nof Palau, an island country found in the Pacific Ocean.\nHowever, now it’s commonly used to represent\n‘Professional Web’ and available for use by anyone.\nAs it happens with many ccTLDs that are repurposed\nto what are effectively gTLDS, they find their way onto\nour Top 20. As prices are dropped, those wishing to\nburn through domains i.e. cybercriminals, look for the\ncheapest domains available.\n\n### Interpreting the data\n\nRegistries with a greater number of active domains have\ngreater exposure to abuse. For example, in Q3 2023,\n**.ru had more than 5 million domains, of which 0.001%**\nwere associated with botnet C&Cs. Meanwhile, .pw had\napproximately 13,000 domains, of which 1.16% were\nassociated with botnet C&Cs. Both are in the top twenty\nof our listings. Still, one had a much higher percentage\nof domains related to botnet C&Cs than the other.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused top-level domains,  Q3 2023 (continued)\n\n### Working together with the industry for  a safer internet\n\nNaturally, we prefer no TLDs to have botnet C&Cs linked **New entries**\nwith them, but we live in the real world and understand\nthere will always be abuse.\n\nbuzz (#11), sbs (#14).\n\nWhat is crucial is that abuse is dealt with quickly.\n\n**Departures**\n\nWhere necessary, if domain names are registered\nsolely for distributing malware or hosting botnet C&Cs, cloud, me, net, us, xyz.\nwe would like registries to suspend these domain names.\nWe greatly appreciate the efforts of many registries who\nwork with us to ensure these actions are taken.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused top-level domains,  Q3 2023 (continued)\n\n\n### Top abused TLDs - number of domains\n\n\n**Rank** **Q2 2023** **Q3 2023** **% Change** **TLD** **Note**\n\n**#1** 1741 1904 9% com gTLD\n\n**#2** 226 449 99% shop gTLD\n\n**#3** 47 220 368% makeup gTLD\n\n**#4** 94 201 114% beauty gTLD\n\n**#5** - 164 New entry best gTLD\n\n**#6** - 153 New entry pw ccTLD\n\n**#7** 85 130 53% info gTLD\n\n**#8** - 109 New entry hair gTLD\n\n**#9** 161 93 -42% top gTLD\n\n**#10** 50 80 60% site gTLD\n\n**#11** - 70 New entry buzz gTLD\n\n**#12** 188 66 -65% ru ccTLD\n\n**#13** 44 64 45% cfd gTLD\n\n**#14** - 55 New entry sbs gTLD\n\n**#14** 238 55 -77% rest gTLD\n\n**#16** 161 47 -71% cyou gTLD\n\n**#17** 80 35 -56% org gTLD\n\n**#17** 157 35 -78% cn ccTLD\n\n**#19** 90 34 -62% br ccTLD\n\n**#20** 40 32 -20% io ccTLD\n\n\n**0** **500** **1000** **1500** **2000**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused domain registrars,  Q3 2023\n\n### Cloudflare enters at #5\n\nRegular readers will be used to seeing Cloudflare regularly\nenter and depart our network-focused charts.

Meanwhile,\n(disappointingly), NameSilo continues it’s upward\ntrajectory making it past the 1,000 marker, and steadfastly\nholding onto its #1 spot.\n\n### Decreases for many registrars\n\nEleven out of the fifteen registrars listed in Q2’s Top 20,\nsaw decreases in the number of botnet C&C operators\nregistering through them.
