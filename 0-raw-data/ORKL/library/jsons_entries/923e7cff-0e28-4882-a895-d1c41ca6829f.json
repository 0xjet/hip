The hint is there - just make sure to carefully read between the lines._**\n\n_Source: Russian OSINT YouTube Channel LockBit Interview_\n\n_“Money (greed) Beats Evil”_\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\nIn a recent interview by a Russian-speaking tech blog YouTube channel “Russian\nOSINT” published on August 23, 2021, (in Russian), the representative of the LockBit\n2.0 ransomware group shared insights of their operations and their views of the\nransomware business in general.\n\nSuch interviews are commonly weaponized by the RaaS syndicates and cybercrime to\nserve as a public relations practice in order to attract new affiliates, intimidate the\npublic, and promote their advanced technical features.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe public outreach of LockBit was likely intended to strengthen the syndicate s media\nstanding and ensure the trust of potential affiliates by promoting alleged high-level\nmoral and business standards claimed by this group.\n\nAn interview has clear political overtones as it covers various aspects such as\nsyndicates' victim's preference and the reflection of current geopolitical agenda,\nspecifically - the US-Russia relationships. The syndicate’s rhetoric and public stance\nhave clear similarities with the current political message propagated by the Russian\nstate.\n\n**Background**\n\nRansomware has become the main player within the cyber-geopolitical board game. The\nRussian-language segment of the ransomware community clearly dominates the dark market\nas well as world media front pages. A relatively novel ransomware group, LockBit 2.0, joined\nthe cybercrime arena in July of 2021 and has a high potential of becoming the leading\nextortionist syndicate by bringing talented hackers together in order to achieve for-profit or\neven political goals.\n\n[On August 23, 2021, a Russian-speaking tech blog YouTube channel “Russian OSINT”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldgmx4ZCfFg&t=54s)\npublished an interview with the representatives of LockBit uncovering details of their\noperations. Media interviews became routine for ransomware syndicates and have taken\nplace in large numbers over the past year across various platforms reaching both Russianand English-speaking audiences. Building public relations is an essential part of the\nransomware business model as it is used to not only grow the business but also attract\ntalented pen-testers.\n\n**Investigative Analysis**\n\nAdvIntel summarizes 5 essential points of the interview with the LockBit 2.0 representative\nand uncovers the interpretation behind their words.\n\n**1. Operations**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Nobody can beat us when it comes to the speed of encryption and data exfiltration, plus the_\n_level of automation with the distribution and encryption are processed. All it takes is one run_\n_on a domain controller and the entire corporate network is encrypted in the shortest amount_\n_of time.”_\n\nBy listing their technical features, the syndicate hopes to attract the most talented hackers\nout there to enrich their team with sophisticated pen testers. Time is money in ransomware\noperators' minds - one business day is all it takes to get a victim’s network as a hostage, they\nsay.\n\nThe LockBit 2.0 representative claims their ransomware to have the most advanced\ntechnical features allowing it to stand up among its competitors. Stated features include:\n\n1) the fastest encryption speed and data exfiltration\n\n2) automated process of distribution and encryption.\n\n3) Immediate data exfiltration\n\nAccording to the representative, it takes one run to encrypt the whole victim's network in the\nshortest amount of time. In addition, affiliates no longer need to fiddle with servers and cloud\nstorage and “waste time on tedious network routines, subsequently losing data after the first\n_complaint to the cloud provider.” All victim data is being stored in their data leak website_\nwhere each file can be downloaded separately.\n\n\n-----\n\n_LockBit referenced the use of BitDefender as a solution against ransomware attacks. At the_\n_same time, it is known that ransomware groups are focused on bypassing this tool, including_\n_the use of the official Bitdefender Uninstall Tool in order to disable the defenses_\n\n_Another widely discussed offensive capability that LockBit may have but which has not been_\n_mentioned in the interview is insider hiring. In the underground discussions (including the_\n_one on the image above) actors reported that for the high-profile attacks including the_\n_Accenture incident LockBit has been using insiders to initiate the operation._\n\n_Source: (Russian-language underground forums)_\n\n\n-----\n\n**2. Victimology**\n\n_“We do not attack healthcare and educational institutions, as well as social services and_\n_charities. Anything that contributes to the development of human beings and their safety_\n_remains untouched. ”_\n\nIndeed, ransomware syndicates claim to care about morals and promote a high level of\nmorality for future victims. However, as seen by numerous examples of other groups, most\nimportantly, DarkSide, REvil, and BlackMatter, such “moral agendas” never go beyond such\nflamboyant phrases. LockBit is likely no exception.\n\nIn reality, pushing the “social responsibility” agenda is just one more point for the syndicate in\norder to score high reputation points and establish a positive - as much as it can be - image\nof a business partner with high values for easier negotiations. “We value our reputation and\n_destroy all of the victim's data if the ransom is paid, guaranteeing full confidentiality of the_\n_deal”, - they add._\n\nThe bulk of the RaaS victimology is for-profit corporations as they are perceived as victims\npaying large ransoms without causing massive social and political backlashes.\n\n_A “loud” attack (media-covered) is bad for the company because it causes them reputational_\n_losses. A quiet attack is good for both - the company and for our money._\n\nThis being said, except for proper cybersecurity defenses, nothing saves critical industries\nsuch as healthcare and education from a ransomware attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Source: Russian OSINT YouTube Channel LockBit Interview_\n\n**3. Internal Structure & Affiliates**\n\n_“Our program lets affiliates handle negotiation processes with encrypted companies. Thus,_\n_we are not cheating anyone for money like Avaddon, DarkSide and REvil did.”_\n\nBy addressing the set of high business standards, the representative stresses a series of\nincidents inside of ransomware operations that caused a backlash from the underground\ncommunity. Avaddon, DarkSide, and REvil indeed performed exit scams or scammed their\nown affiliates by interfering in negotiations between the victim and affiliate and hijacking the\nransom payment from an affiliate. It is noteworthy how LockBit attempts to address the\ndistrust of RaaS created by these three groups and pacify the affiliates’ fears.\n\nAccording to the representative, from now on, LockBit ransom payment is made entirely to\nthe affiliate's wallets. The affiliate then transfers 20% of the payment to the LockBit\nleadership. This, in turn, will help to improve relationships with future and existing affiliates\nand rehabilitate ransomware reputation across the underground community.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Infographic reflects a scheme which, according to the cybercriminals, is used by_\n_cybersecurity companies and was mentioned by the LockBit 2.0 representative. According to_\n_LockBit, incident response companies make a profit by obtaining a decryption key for a lower_\n_price compared to a ransom requested from the victim thus keeping the difference in their_\n_pockets._\n\n_Source: Russian OSINT YouTube Channel LockBit Interview_\n\n**4. Operational Environment & Strategy**\n\nAlthough ransomware syndicates repeatedly deny any allegations of cooperation with the\nstate (primarily the Russian state), the words of the LockBit representative surprisingly\ncorrelate with the rhetoric of Russian officials that is actively propagated in the local media.\n\n_“The United States of America was founded by foreign invaders who exterminated the native_\n_population of the continent and regularly violates human rights to this day. There is a reason_\n_why the BLM movement exists in the U.S. Moreover, the United States is essentially a_\n_(money) printing press and as a result, they behave as if they were the masters of the world.”_\n\n\n-----\n\nSuch statements are widespread across Russian media outlets. Weaponizing the subject of\nracial tensions in the U.S. has been religiously practiced even by the early Soviet and\npropaganda. Just like its Socialist predecessor today, the Russian state intentionally focuses\non this narrative in order to cover up major failings of its own judicial system and ongoing\nhuman rights violations. At the same time, Russian state propaganda refers to the US’s\nleading role in the global finances to justify the hardship of the domestic economic crisis.\n\n**The LockBit representative has been the first member of the cybercriminal**\n**community, which traditionally is very apolitical, who has started to publicly**\n**reiterate these key concepts of the regime’s narrative.**\n\nMoreover, according to Russian media, the United States is continuing to be the main enemy\nand even threat to the world. The latest observation of Russian media demonstrates an\nincrease in discussions centered around the cyber domain and cyber warfare. Responding to\nthe increasing geopolitical tensions, the Russian state media channels push the agenda to\ndeny any involvement of the government or security apparatus in the cybercriminal activity.\nThe state media is also occupying prime time with alarmist reports predicting possible\nupcoming cyber attacks coming from the U.S.\n\nLockBit transfers this narrative as well by stating:\n\n_“The West presents Russia as an invader and as the common enemy. Therefore, it is_\n_essential for the West, to use any opportunity, to accuse Russia of any mortal sins in order to_\n_form a negative opinion about this main enemy. As a result, there is absolutely no need (for_\n_the West) to ground or back up these accusations. The West behaves in the same way with_\n_China as well.”_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Source: Russian OSINT YouTube Channel LockBit Interview_\n\n**_5. Security_**\n\n_“The only way you can feel the pressure from the security apparatus is when they are_\n_already at your doorstep physically breaching your door or your window. It is impossible (for_\n_security services) to put pressure or intimidate us by any other means.”_\n\nThe fact that the group claims no fear of being arrested by law enforcement does not indicate\ndirect cooperation with the government. However, such an approach does imply that RaaS\nactivities may be fully in line with the Russian state agenda as long as the actors follow the\norder. The rule is still the same - to whitelist CIS countries (The Commonwealth of\nIndependent States) - except for Ukraine and the Baltics. This list is also being extended to\nthe state’s partners that share geopolitical or economical interests, for example, Turkey,\nSyria, Iran, and China. As long as ransomware syndicates comply with these rules, there is\nno incentive for Russian law enforcement to go after cybercriminals as they technically\noperate “outside” of the country's borders.\n\n\n-----\n\nMoreover, Russia has no extradition treaty with the United States, while the two states face a\nlack of security cooperation driven by geopolitical issues that lead to disputes over\nextradition. It is not surprising, therefore that the representative states:\n\n_“We benefit from the hostile attitude of the West (towards Russia). It allows us to do conduct_\n_such an aggressive business and operate freely within the borders of the former Soviet (CIS)_\n_countries.”_\n\nDespite the so-called freedom, the representative admits that their actions bring a lot of\nstress to their life. Indeed, from the outside ransomware business might look like a gangster\naction movie, the only difference being that in reality there is life and freedom at stake. “I\n_don't sleep very well at night”, said the LockBit representative and they probably have a good_\nreason to say so. The recent geopolitical events - most importantly the Russia-US summit\nhave put ransomware into the spotlight. With the ongoing pressure from the President Biden\nadministration against cyber threats originating from the region, the Russian underground\nhas been experiencing waves of paranoia. The cybercriminal groups are attempting to keep\na low profile in order to avoid a takedown by the Russian law enforcement - a takedown\nwhich the regime can use to bolster their negotiations with the US.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nRaaS interviews became a normal practice for ransomware businesses to demonstrate their\npower to attract new affiliates and intimidate the public. The LockBit interview is unique as it\nhas a clear political context that correlates with the Russian state narrative.\n\nAt the same time, these public interactions are most importantly an attempt to address the\npublic trust crisis which RaaS is facing with their own affiliates - current or prospective. Exit\nscams and disappearances of large syndicates such as REvil, make LockBit one of the\nmajor players in the field and require the gang to provide a positive message.\n\n_A comment left by one of the cybercrime community members on the day of the interview_\n_publishing highlighting major flaws in LockBit’s activities_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Source: (Russian-language underground forums)_\n\nDespite a clear political statement involved, the whole spectacle probability originated as\nLockBit’s attempt to reshuffle internal power struggles and improve the image within the\nunderground community. An improvement that the group definitely requires.\n\n**Mitigations & Recommendations**\n\nLockBit 2.0 is known for actively exploiting public-facing applications. Therefore\nmonitoring endpoints should be the first mitigation strategy. The group specifically\nprefers the following infrastructural endpoints:\n\nCorporate VPN - especially Citrix/FortiNET\n\nExternally exposed RDPs\n\nAs a top-tier ransomware group, LockBit likely investigates recent CVEs including\nProxyLogon and Microsoft Exchange exposure. Monitoring exposed endpoints and\napplication of CVE-addressing patches is required.\n\nLockBit prioritizes network investigation which enables them to steal sensitive data.\nTherefore, disrupting network movements via creating segregated segments of\nnetwork, clear access hierarchy, and additional security for active directory, domain\nadmin, and local domains can significantly complicate their operations.\n\nMultifactor authentication is required to protect employees’ accounts from obtaining\naccount credentials by actors that might be used to escalate privileges and move\nlaterally within the network.\n\nIt is suggested to perform daily backups and keep them offline to avoid data loss.\n\n**Translation and transcript of the full LockBit interview in English and Russian**\n**prepared by AdvIntel is available below:**\n\nAdvIntel-LockBit-Interview_Translation-&-Transcript\n\n.pdf\n\nDownload PDF • 4.31MB\n\n**IoCs**\n\n**File Hashes**\n\n\n-----\n\nSha256 - 0545f842ca2eb77bcac0fd17d6d0a8c607d7dbc8669709f3096e5c1828e1c049\n\n**URLs**\n\nhxxp://lockbitapt6vx57t3eeqjofwgcglmutr3a35nygvokja5uuccip4ykyd[.]onion\n\nhxxp://lockbitsap2oaqhcun3syvbqt6n5nzt7fqosc6jdlmsfleu3ka4k2did[.]onion\n\nhxxp://lockbitsup4yezcd5enk5unncx3zcy7kw6wllyqmiyhvanjj352jayid[.]onion\n\nT1562.001: Impair defenses: disable or modify tools\n\nT1070.001: Indicator removal on host: clear Windows Event Logs\n\nT1041: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\n\nT1486: Data encrypted for impact\n\nT1489: Service stop\n\nT1490: Inhibit System Recovery\n\n\n-----",
