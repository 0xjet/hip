    "plain_text": "# Darkside Ransomware: Falcon Protects Customers\n\n**[crowdstrike.com/blog/falcon-protects-from-darkside-ransomware/](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/falcon-protects-from-darkside-ransomware/)**\n\nKaran Sood - Shaun Hurley - Adrian-Liviu Arsene May 18, 2021\n\nThe CrowdStrike Falcon® platform provides CrowdStrike clients with protection from\nDarkSide ransomware\nDarkSide is a ransomware as a service (RaaS) associated with an eCrime group\ntracked by CrowdStrike as CARBON SPIDER\n\nRansomware incidents such as the DarkSide attack that disrupted a major fuel pipeline —\none that transports almost half of all fuel consumed on the East Coast of the United States\n— underscore the fragility of our critical infrastructure, and the magnitude of the problems\nfaced by the public and private sector leaders who are charged with protecting it.\n\n“The vulnerability of infrastructure is significant to our national security and the operations of\nthis country,” said Shawn Henry, CrowdStrike CSO and President of CrowdStrike Services, in\nan [interview for MSNBC. “These organized crime groups have been making billions of](https://t.co/kTiPfoxtdq?amp=1)\ndollars by extorting U.S. companies and global companies that have not been able to protect\nthemselves from this debilitating ransomware.”\n\n## Who Was Behind the Pipeline Attack?\n\n\n-----\n\nDarkSide is associated with a criminal group tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence as\n[CARBON SPIDER. Security researchers, customers and anyone interested in learning more](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/adversary/carbon-spider/)\nabout the technical tradecraft, the targeted verticals and the origin of CARBON SPIDER can\n[explore the CrowdStrike Adversary Universe for intelligence on all tracked adversaries. This](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/)\ninformation is consistently updated, and enterprises can use it to defend their organizations\nagainst some of the most persistent adversaries active now.\n\nCARBON SPIDER first emerged in 2013 and is known to conduct several different financially\nmotivated operations. In the summer of 2020, it began using ransomware and ultimately built\nand marketed its own ransomware as a service (RaaS), which it dubbed “DarkSide.”\n\nDarkSide operators traditionally focused on Windows machines and have recently expanded\nto Linux, targeting enterprise environments running unpatched VMware ESXi hypervisors or\nstealing vCenter credentials to log in to management consoles directly, to encrypt virtual\nmachine files. This tactic further increases the scope of affected systems, placing additional\npressure on victims to give in to ransom demands.\n\nDarkSide operators seemed to pride themselves on their ability to vet affiliates that match a\nstrictly defined set of criteria and adhere to their code of conduct. While the eCrime group\nclaimed in the past that it will not target medical, educational or government institutions, it is\nclear that either its vetting process is not strict or some affiliates may not share their beliefs.\n[DarkSide ransomware operators to whom this incident was attributed issued a statement](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/statement-suspected-us-pipeline-hackers-say-they-dont-want-cause-problems-2021-05-10/)\nclaiming their goals are strictly financially motivated, with no political affiliation or intent to\ncause societal problems.\n\n(According to [Krebs on Security, the DarkSide ransomware affiliate program behind the](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/darkside-ransomware-gang-quits-after-servers-bitcoin-stash-seized/)\npipeline attack later “announced it was closing up shop after its servers were seized and\nsomeone drained the cryptocurrency from an account the group uses to pay affiliates.”)\n\n## Falcon vs. DarkSide: How CrowdStrike Protects Customers\n\nThe CrowdStrike Falcon platform incorporates intelligence derived from continuous\nmonitoring of the tactics, techniques and procedures of over 160 identified threat actors and\nnumerous unnamed groups, enabling us to protect organizations from sophisticated attacks,\nincluding DarkSide ransomware.\n\nCrowdStrike employs a layered approach when it comes to detecting malware, including\n[machine learning as well as indicators of attack (IOAs). As the screenshot below shows, the](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/indicators-of-compromise/ioa-vs-ioc/)\nFalcon sensor is able to kill the ransomware process as soon as the file encryption behavior\nis seen.\n\n\n-----\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\n[This video demonstrates how the DarkSide ransomware sample is immediately blocked and](https://crowdstrike.wistia.com/medias/of3a6d35lu)\nquarantined by Falcon upon execution. CrowdStrike’s machine learning engine is part of the\nFalcon agent and can protect the system online or offline. In addition to machine learning,\nCrowdStrike Falcon’s built-in behavioral detection also identifies the rapid encryption of files\nand blocks the ransomware execution to protect the system.\n\nCrowdStrike takes layered security to the next level by integrating machine learning and\nbehavioral detection within a single lightweight agent to protect those systems critical to our\ncustomers.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n[Organizations that are being hit with DarkSide or other ransomware risk a significant impact](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/)\nto their business operations for a protracted period of time. Companies have to protect\nthemselves, making sure they have the right technology in place and the right visibility into\ntheir environments so that they can disrupt these operations through their security\ninfrastructure.\n\n[The U.S. government, law enforcement and security companies understandably recommend](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/05/11/joint-cisa-fbi-cybersecurity-advisory-darkside-ransomware)\nthat companies do not give in to ransomware and extortion demands. Unfortunately, public\nand private entities are sometimes stuck in a situation where they cannot reconstitute their\nenvironment, making an attack an existential threat to the organization.\n\nTherefore, it’s vitally important for companies to protect themselves before an incident\noccurs, especially as ransomware is a prolific business that adversaries will continue to\ninvest in.\n\nProtecting our customers against threats like DarkSide ransomware and sophisticated\nadversaries like CARBON SPIDER is something the CrowdStrike platform does every day.\n[Organizations currently leveraging the Falcon platform can quickly and effectively detect and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-platform/)\nprotect against DarkSide ransomware and other BGH attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nIndependent third-party validation also supports the strength of our platform. CrowdStrike\nFalcon has recently been named a leader in the Gartner 2021 Magic Quadrant for Endpoint\nProtection Platforms (EPP) and The Forrester Wave™ Endpoint Security Software As A\nService. In addition, CrowdStrike Falcon has consistently proven its detection and protection\ncapabilities in tests performed by leading independent testing organizations, such as MITRE,\nSE Labs, AV-TEST and AV-Comparatives.\n\nBy deploying the Falcon platform and following the recommended “1-10-60” benchmark time\n(one minute to detect an incident, 10 minutes to investigate and one hour to remediate),\norganizations will have the best available protection for their operations and data from\nransomware attacks like DarkSide.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_Learn about recent intrusion trends, adversary tactics and highlights of notable_\n_[intrusions in the CrowdStrike 2021 Global Threat Report.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/global-threat-report/)_\n_Understand the trends and themes that we observed while responding to and_\n_remediating incidents around the globe in 2020 — download the latest CrowdStrike_\n_Services Cyber Front Lines Report._\n_[Learn more about the CrowdStrike Falcon® platform by visiting the product webpage.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-platform/)_\n_[Test CrowdStrike next-gen AV for yourself.
