For each story, we sought to summarize the most significant facts, findings, and conclusions of researchers, which we believe can be of use to experts who address practical issues related to ensuring the cybersecurity of industrial enterprises.\n\nAPT ATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS 1\n\n\n-----\n\n## SolarWinds\n\nA large-scale and sophisticated supply chain attack on SolarWinds’ Orion IT\n[enterprise software was described in our previous APT review. Researchers](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/reports/2021/03/29/apt-attacks-on-industrial-companies-in-2020/#_Toc67312781)\ncontinued to investigate the case and reported new findings.\n\n[New malware families were discovered: one, named “Sunspot”, was deployed in](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sunspot-malware-technical-analysis)\nSeptember 2019, when the attackers first breached the company’s network. It\nwas installed on SolarWinds' build server and was designed to monitor the server\nfor commands that assembled the Orion product. Once an Orion build command\nwas detected, the malware silently replaced a source code file with a file that\n[loaded the Sunburst malware. Another, named “Raindrop”, is a backdoor loader](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/solarwinds-raindrop-malware)\nthat drops Cobalt Strike, post-compromise, as a means of moving laterally\n[across the target network. Microsoft has published a further analysis of the](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/01/20/deep-dive-into-the-solorigate-second-stage-activation-from-sunburst-to-teardrop-and-raindrop/)\nmalware used in the attack, in particular the missing chain in the attack and the\nsequence of processes leading from the Sunburst backdoor to the execution of\nthe Cobalt Strike loader. The attackers separated these two components as far\nas possible to evade detection. The research also includes an analysis of\nadditional hands-on-keyboard techniques used by the attackers during initial\nreconnaissance, data collection and exfiltration, in addition to the broader TTPs\npublished already.\n\nLater, new malware families used by the threat group behind the SolarWinds\n[attack were identified. They include a backdoor called GoldMax (aka Sunshuttle),](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/03/sunshuttle-second-stage-backdoor-targeting-us-based-entity.html)\n[Sibot and GoldFinder.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/04/goldmax-goldfinder-sibot-analyzing-nobelium-malware/)\n\n[Prodaft, a Swiss cybersecurity firm, has published research describing the](https://github.com/prodaft/malware-ioc/blob/master/SilverFish/SilverFish_TLPWHITE.pdf)\nactivity of a group they found and dubbed SilverFish, which they claim was\nconnected with the SolarWinds incidents (they believe multiple groups, each\nwith its own motives, were behind the incidents). The group was responsible for\nintrusions at over 4720 private and government organizations, including Fortune\n500 companies, ministries, airlines, defense contractors, audit and consultancy\ncompanies, and automotive manufacturers. An extensive campaign was active\nbetween August 2020 and March 2021. Prodaft managed to access one of the\ngroup’s C2 servers. It obtained valuable information on the victims and postexploitation activities from the server. The most unusual activity they\ndiscovered was the use of existing enterprise victims as a sandbox for testing\nmalicious payloads for detection with enterprise EDR and AV solutions, with the\nresults of scanning reported back to the server.\n\nAPT ATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS 2\n\n\n-----\n\n## Cicada/APT10\n\n[In November and December 2020, Symantec](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-japan-espionage) [and LAC](https://www.lac.co.jp/lacwatch/report/20201201_002363.html) published blog posts\nabout a campaign of an actor known as APT10. One month later, Kaspersky\n[observed](https://securelist.com/apt10-sophisticated-multi-layered-loader-ecipekac-discovered-in-a41apt-campaign/101519/) new activities from the actor with an updated version of some of their\nimplants designed to evade security products and make analysis more difficult\nfor researchers.\n\nKaspersky has investigated a long-running espionage campaign dubbed\n\"A41APT\" targeting multiple industries, including the Japanese manufacturing\nindustry and its overseas bases, active since March 2019. The attackers used\n[vulnerabilities in an SSL-VPN product](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2020/04/attacks-exploiting-vulnerabilities-in-pulse-connect-secure.html) to deploy a multi-layered loader that was\ndubbed “Ecipekac” (aka DESLoader, SigLoader and HEAVYHAND). Most of the\npayloads deployed by this loader that have been discovered are fileless and had\nnot been seen before. The following malware was observed: “SodaMaster” (aka\nDelfsCake, dfls and DARKTOWN), “P8RAT” (aka GreetCake and HEAVYPOT),\nand “FYAnti” (aka DILLJUICE Stage 2), which in turn loads QuasarRAT, a popular\nopen-source remote administration tool.\n\nEcipekac infection flow (source: [Kaspersky)](https://securelist.com/apt10-sophisticated-multi-layered-loader-ecipekac-discovered-in-a41apt-campaign/101519/)\n\n## Andariel\n\n[Kaspersky has discovered](https://securelist.com/andariel-evolves-to-target-south-korea-with-ransomware/102811/) Andariel activity targeting a broad spectrum of\nindustries located in South Korea, including organizations in the manufacturing,\nhome network service, media and construction sectors, using a revised infection\nscheme and, in one case, custom ransomware. In April, Kaspersky observed\na decoy document with a Korean file name uploaded to VirusTotal. It revealed\na novel infection scheme and an unfamiliar payload.\n\nAPT ATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS 3\n\n\n-----\n\n[Infection flow (Source: Kaspersky)](https://securelist.com/andariel-evolves-to-target-south-korea-with-ransomware/102811/)\n\nThe threat actor has been spreading the third stage payload since the middle of\n2020 and leveraged malicious Word documents and files mimicking PDF\ndocuments as infection vectors. Notably, in addition to the final backdoor, one\nvictim became infected with custom ransomware, adding another facet to this\ncampaign of Andariel, which also sought financial gain in a previous operation\ninvolving the compromise of ATMs.\n\n[During the course of this research, Malwarebytes published a report with](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/malwarebytes-news/2021/04/lazarus-apt-conceals-malicious-code-within-bmp-file-to-drop-its-rat/)\ntechnical details of the same series of attacks, attributing it to the Lazarus\ngroup. After a deep analysis, Kaspersky came to a more precise conclusion in this\nregard: we believe that the Andariel branch of the Lazarus group was behind\nthese attacks. Code overlaps between the second stage payload in this\ncampaign and earlier Andariel malware allowed for this attribution. Apart from\nthe code similarity and the victimology, the way Windows commands and their\noptions were used in a backdoor shell in the post-exploitation phase is almost\nidentical to earlier Andariel activity.\n\n## China-Linked Threat Groups\n\n[The Cybereason Nocturnus Team has found](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/portdoor-new-chinese-apt-backdoor-attack-targets-russian-defense-sector) spear-phishing RTF documents\nweaponized with RoyalRoad that deliver PortDoor malware, a previously\nundocumented backdoor assessed to have been developed by a threat actor\nlikely operating in Chinese state interests. Over the years, the RoyalRoad\nweaponizer, also known as the 8.t Dropper/RTF exploit builder has been included\nin the arsenal of several Chinese-related threat actors such as Tick, Tonto Team\nand TA428, all of which use RoyalRoad regularly for spear-phishing in targeted\nattacks against high-value targets.\n\nAccording to the phishing lure content examined, the target of the attack was\nthe CEO of the Rubin Design Bureau, a Russian defense contractor that designs\nsubmarines for the Russian Navy.\n\nAPT ATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS 4\n\n\n-----\n\nA series of ransomware attacks with unclear purposes hit Taiwan organizations\n[in April and May 2020. Affected organizations include CPC Corporation —](https://medium.com/cycraft/china-linked-threat-group-targets-taiwan-critical-infrastructure-smokescreen-ransomware-c2a155aa53d5)\na state-owned petroleum, natural gas, and gasoline company and the largest\n[gasoline supplier in Taiwan, Formosa Petrochemical Corporation, Chunghwa](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3928508)\nTelecom [and, reportedly, organizations in the semiconductor industry. Given the](https://blog.cyberint.com/targeted-ransomware-attacks-in-taiwan)\nhighly targeted nature of these attacks, their lack of sophistication and the lack\nof contact information for ransomware payments in some of the ransomware\nvariants, as well as the fact that the campaign was launched just one week\nbefore the president’s inauguration in Taiwan, some believe the true motive\nbehind these attacks may be not financial gain but something else, such as\ncausing disruption or drawing the attention away from other activity. On May 15,\nthe Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice (MJIB) released an\n[investigation report](https://www.mjib.gov.tw/news/Details/1/607) stating that Winnti or another closely related group was\nsuspected of being behind these attacks.\n\n## ReverseRat attacks in India and Afghanistan\n\n[Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs has discovered](https://blog.lumen.com/suspected-pakistani-actor-compromises-indian-power-company-with-new-reverserat/) an attack in which the majority of\nvictims are located in India and a small number in Afghanistan. The attack\ninvolves a new remote access Trojan called ReverseRat. Victims include a\ngovernment organization, a power transmission organization, and a power\ngeneration and transmission organization somewhere in “South and Central Asia”\n(the country remains undisclosed). The actor behind this campaign has\noperational infrastructure hosted in Pakistan and researchers assume that it also\noriginates from that country. The infection chain of this campaign and its TTPs\n[are correlated with last year’s campaign called Operation SideCopy.](https://www.seqrite.com/documents/en/white-papers/Seqrite-WhitePaper-Operation-SideCopy.pdf)\n\n[Multi-step infection process observed in the campaign (Source: Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs)](https://blog.lumen.com/suspected-pakistani-actor-compromises-indian-power-company-with-new-reverserat/)\n\nAPT ATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS 5\n\n\n-----\n\nA multi-step infection chain results in the victim downloading two agents: one\n[resides in-memory (ReverseRAT), while the second is side-loaded (AllaKore),](https://github.com/OneideLuizSchneider/AllaKore_Remote)\nensuring the threat actor’s persistence on infected workstations. The original\nURLs that are the sources of the entire infection chain have not been found, but\nthey are likely sent in targeted emails or messages, as observed in the actor’s\nsimilar campaigns.\n\n## Operation Spalax\n\n[Researchers have uncovered](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/01/12/operation-spalax-targeted-malware-attacks-colombia/) attacks targeting Colombian organizations,\nincluding government institutions and private companies, particularly in the\nenergy and metallurgical industries. The ongoing attacks, dubbed “Operation\nSpalax”, install remote access Trojans, most likely to conduct cyber-espionage\nactivities\n\n[Operation Spalax infection process (Source: ESET)](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/01/12/operation-spalax-targeted-malware-attacks-colombia/)\n\nThe attacks observed in 2020 share some TTPs with those described in earlier\n[reports on groups targeting Colombia, for example, the QiAnXin report and the](https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/apt-c-36-continuous-attacks-targeting-colombian-government-institutions-and-corporations-en/)\n[TrendMicro report. The phishing emails used in the attack lead to malicious files](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/spam-campaign-targets-colombian-entities-with-custom-proyecto-rat-email-service-yopmail-for-cc/)\nbeing downloaded. In most cases, these emails have a PDF document attached\nto them, which contains a link that the user must click to download the malware.\nThe files that are downloaded are regular RAR archives containing an executable\n\nAPT ATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS 6\n\n\n-----\n\nfile. The payloads installed by operation Spalax are popular cybercriminal RATs:\nRemcos, njRAT and AsyncRAT. Several droppers have been observed that are\nvariants of a packer which uses steganography. These droppers have previously\nbeen used with Agent Tesla samples, but in this case, they contained no Agent\nTesla payload.\n\n## New Lazarus activities uncovered\n\nFollowing up on an [earlier investigation](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/reports/2021/02/25/lazarus-targets-defense-industry-with-threatneedle/) into Lazarus attacks on the defense\n[industry that used the ThreatNeedle cluster, Kaspersky discovered another](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q1-2021/101967/)\nmalware cluster named CookieTime, used in a campaign that was mainly focused\non the defense industry. We detected related activity in September and\nNovember 2020, with samples dating back to April 2020. CookieTime has a\ndifferent structure and functionality, compared to known malware clusters of\nthe Lazarus group. This malware communicates with the C2 server using the\nHTTP protocol. It uses encoded cookie values to deliver requests to the C2\nserver and to fetch command files from the C2 server. The C2 communication\ntakes advantage of steganography techniques used in files exchanged between\ninfected clients and the C2 server. The data transferred is disguised as GIF\nimage files that contain encrypted commands from the C2 server and command\nexecution results. Kaspersky researchers had a chance to look into the\ncommand-and-control script as a result of working closely with a local CERT\nto take down the threat actor’s infrastructure. The malware control servers are\nconfigured in a multi-stage fashion and only deliver the command file to valuable\nhosts.\n\n[ESET researchers have discovered](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/04/08/are-you-afreight-dark-watch-out-vyveva-new-lazarus-backdoor/) a previously undocumented backdoor,\ndubbed “Vyveva”, used to target a freight logistics company in South Africa.\nThe backdoor is designed to collect information from the victim’s computer and\nexfiltrate data. The malware communicates with the C2 via the Tor network.\nResearchers attribute this to Lazarus based on similarities with the threat actor’s\nprevious operations and samples.\n\n## RedEcho/ShadowPad\n\n[Recorded Future researchers have observed](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector/) an increase in targeted intrusion\nactivities against India’s power sector since early 2020. They attribute the\nactivity to a threat actor dubbed “RedEcho”. Since mid-2020, there was a steep\nrise in the use of the infrastructure they track as “AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE”,\n[which encompasses ShadowPad](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/) C2 servers.\n\nAPT ATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS 7\n\n\n-----\n\n## Zebrocy\n\n\nKaspersky has also researched the 2020-2021 attacks in India in involving the\nShadowPad loader and infrastructure described by Recorded Future. A broader\ngeography of victims was discovered based on telemetry data. Victims of these\nattacks include critical infrastructure organizations. The toolset used in these\nattacks includes an updated ShadowPad loader dubbed “ShadowShredder”.\nIt was described in a private APT report. Still, attribution remains vague, as\n[ShadowPad was originally known to be used by the BARIUM/APT41 group](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/) (aka\n“Winnti”), but since 2019 it has been used by multiple other Chinese speaking APT\nactors such as Tick, CactusPete, and IceFog.\n\n[In March, researchers observed](https://labs.sentinelone.com/a-deep-dive-into-zebrocys-dropper-docs/) a cluster of activities targeting Kazakhstan with\nDelphocy – malware written in Delphi that has previously been associated with\nZebrocy, supposedly a subgroup of Sofacy. The lures were Word documents\npurportedly created by a company named Kazchrome, a mining and metallurgical\ncompany and one of the world’s largest producers of chrome ore and\nferroalloys. Six Delphocy Word documents that appear to be related to this\ncluster have been found in total. All of the documents contain the same VBA\nscript that drops a PE file. Out of the six Word documents observed, two appear\nto be authentic uploads to VirusTotal by victims originating from Kazakhstan.\n\n[Zebrocy is already known](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/reports/2019/01/24/greyenergys-overlap-with-zebrocy/) to have targeted Kazakhstan’s industrial companies\nwith VBA documents back in 2018, so it seems to keep this tactics.\n\n\n## Attack on Iranian centrifuges\n\n[On April 10, there was a power blackout](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/13/iran-nuclear-natanz-israel) at Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility, affecting\nnot only the site’s main power distribution equipment but also its backup\nsystems. Initially, Iranian officials confirmed neither that there were casualties\nnor that the facilities had suffered damage. However, later it was acknowledged\nthat some centrifuges had been damaged and that the “small explosion” had\n“damaged sectors [which] can be quickly repaired.” Iran’s foreign ministry has\n[blamed Israel for sabotaging the country’s main uranium enrichment facility,](https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-iran-358384f03b1ef6b65f4264bf9a59a458)\nalthough this has not been confirmed.\n\nAPT ATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS 8\n\n\n-----\n\n## RATs targeting aerospace\n\n[Researchers have warned](https://blog.morphisec.com/ahk-rat-loader-leveraged-in-unique-delivery-campaigns) of an ongoing spear-phishing campaign targeting\n[aerospace and travel organizations, using a new and stealthy malware loader to](https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1392219299696152578)\ndeploy a series of RATs such as LimeRAT, RevengeRAT, and AsyncRAT. The\nattackers lure their victims with images masquerading as PDF documents that\ncontain information relevant to the target’s industry.\n\n[RAT infection process (Source: Morphisec)](https://blog.morphisec.com/ahk-rat-loader-leveraged-in-unique-delivery-campaigns)\n\nAttackers use remote access Trojans for data theft, follow-on activity, and\nadditional payloads, including Agent Tesla, which they use for data exfiltration.\n[The loader is under active development and is dubbed Snip3 by Morphisec.](https://blog.morphisec.com/revealing-the-snip3-crypter-a-highly-evasive-rat-loader)\n\n## Gelsemium\n\nThe APT threat actor Gelsemium, a cyberespionage group active since 2014,\n[is believed to be responsible for recent supply-chain attacks against targets](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/06/09/gelsemium-when-threat-actors-go-gardening/)\nin China, Japan, Mongolia, Taiwan, North and South Korea, and various Middle\nEastern countries. The targets include governments, religious organizations,\nelectronics manufacturers and universities. The supply chain attack was first\n[described in an Operation NightScout](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/02/01/operation-nightscout-supply-chain-attack-online-gaming-asia/) article. The attack compromised the\nupdate mechanism of NoxPlayer, an Android emulator for PCs and Macs that\n\nAPT ATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS 9\n\n\n-----\n\nis part of BigNox’s product range with over 150 million users worldwide. In these\ncampaigns, ESET researchers found a new version of Gelsemium’s complex and\nmodular malware, as well as additional tools such as the OwlProxy and\nChrommmebackdoors.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo what are the most important conclusions that can be drawn from an analysis\nof publicly available information about APT attacks on industrial organizations\nin H1 2021?\n\nFirst and foremost, that APT researchers have identified no cases of product\ndamage, equipment failure or other (perhaps even graver) physical\nconsequences of attacks on systems that are part of industrial enterprise OT\nnetworks. It is worth mentioning the incident at a water treatment plant in Florida\nin this respect: since it is highly likely that none of the APT groups was involved in\nthat incident, we did not include it in this report. As for the incident at the Natanz\nnuclear plant, we were able to find no reliable data in public sources indicating\nthat this was a cybersecurity incident.\n\nThe next most important conclusions, in our view, reflect today’s overall trends in\nthe evolution of the threat landscape for organizations of various sectors, types,\nand profiles, highlighting common challenges faced both by the threat research\ncommunity and by experts whose work includes ensuring the actual\ncybersecurity of IT and OT infrastructures.\n\nWe can state that:\n\n1. We increasingly see tools formerly associated primarily with criminal\n\nattacks being included in the toolset of APT groups.\n\n            - Social engineering remains the most popular initial penetration method\n\nnot only for cybercriminals, but also for APT groups.\n\n            - APT groups often don’t bother to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities: the\n\ninfrastructure of their potential victims is full of old, well-known flaws\nthat are actively exploited by other attackers (one example is attacks\nthat exploit vulnerabilities in SSL VPN gateways).\n\n            - The widespread use of commercial malware is no longer an indication\n\nof a purely criminal nature of the attacks.\n\n            - A zero-day vulnerability being exploited in an attack is no longer a\n\nclear sign of an APT.\n\n2. The popularity of ‘commercial’ malware among APT actors can be\n\nexplained, apart from purely pecuniary considerations, by the natural wish\n\nAPT ATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS 10\n\n\n-----\n\nto remain unnoticed or at least unrecognized, lost amongst the multitude\nof criminal attacks.\n3. It is worth noting, however, that other things than the toolset can also be\n\nborrowed from cybercriminals for that purpose, such as the\ninfrastructure (we will cover this in our future publications) and even\nstrategy. In H1 2021 (as we [predicted), an APT group followed the steps](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/reports/2020/12/02/ics-threat-predictions-for-2021/)\nof ExPetr operators in trying to disguise their activity as ransomware.\n\n4. Categorizing the diverse tools and infrastructure used in attacks in order\n\nto find out who is behind the various attacks (something information\nsecurity experts call “attribution”) and compiling an encyclopedia of the\nvarious known groups remains a difficult task. Despite the large amount\nof work that has already been done by numerous researchers, finding a\nconsensus often proves impossible. Professional cybersecurity threat\nactors leave few clues, and it often proves impossible to sort out their\ncrimes in the virtual world without ‘the Attorney General’s consent’.\nThis is demonstrated admirably by research into the notorious series of\nSolarWinds related attacks.\n\nAPT ATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS 11\n\n\n-----\n\nKaspersky Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (Kaspersky ICS CERT)\nis a global project of Kaspersky aimed at coordinating the efforts of automation system vendors,\nindustrial facility owners and operators, and IT security researchers to protect industrial enterprises\nfrom cyberattacks. Kaspersky ICS CERT devotes its efforts primarily to identifying potential and\nexisting threats that target industrial automation systems and the industrial internet of things.\n\nKaspersky ICS CERT [ics-cert@kaspersky.com](mailto:ics-cert@kaspersky.com)\n\nAPT ATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS 12\n\n\n-----",
