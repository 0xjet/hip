Until today,\nequipment owners could always remove IoT malware from their smart devices, modems, and\nrouters by resetting the device.\n\nThe reset operation flushed the device's flash memory, where the device would keep all its\nworking data, including IoT malware strains.\n\n## \"Hide and Seek\" malware copies itself to /etc/init.d/\n\n[But today, Bitdefender researchers announced they found an IoT malware strain that under](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2018/05/hide-and-seek-iot-botnet-resurfaces-with-new-tricks-persistence/)\ncertain circumstances copies itself to /etc/init.d/, a folder that houses daemon scripts on\nLinux-based operating systems —like the ones on routers and IoT devices.\n\nBy placing itself in this menu, the device's OS will automatically start the malware's process\nafter the next reboot.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The malware strain that achieved something that even the Mirai strain couldn t is called Hide](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-vulnerability-could-give-mirai-the-ability-to-survive-device-reboots/)\nand Seek (HNS) —also spelled Hide 'N Seek.\n\n## HNS botnet has evolved considerably in the past few months\n\n[Bitdefender experts first spotted the HNS malware and its adjacent botnet in early January,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-hns-iot-botnet-has-already-amassed-14k-bots/)\nthis year, and the botnet grew to around 32,000 bots by the end of the same month. Experts\nsay HNS has infected 90,000 unique devices from the time of discovery until today.\n\nCrooks used two exploits to create their initial botnet, which was unique from other IoT\nbotnets active today because it used a custom P2P protocol to control infected systems.\n\nNow, experts have found new HNS versions that have added support not only for two other\n[exploits [1,](https://vuldb.com/?id.92536) [2] but also for brute-force operations.](http://www.wanda25.de/wansview_ncs601w.html)\n\nWhat this means is that HNS infected devices will scan for other devices that have an\nexposed Telnet port and attempt to log into that device using a list of preset credentials.\n\nResearchers say that HNS authors have also had time to fine-tune this brute-forcing\nscheme, as the malware can identify at least two types of devices and attempt to log into\nthose systems using their factory default credentials, instead of blindly guessing passwords.\n\nFurthermore, the HNS codebase also received updates, and the bot now has ten different\nbinaries for ten different device architectures.\n\n## Not all HNS bots are boot persistent\n\nBut HNS is not capable of gaining boot permission on all infected devices. According to\nBitdefender senior e-threat analyst Bogdan Botezatu, \"in order to achieve persistence, the\ninfection must take place via Telnet, as root privileges are required to copy the binary to the\ninit.d directory.\"\n\nThe security expert also adds that the HNS botnet is still a work-in-progress, and the\nmalware still doesn't support launching DDoS attacks.\n\nNonetheless, the functions to steal data and execute code on infected devices are still there,\nwhich means the botnet supports a plugin/module system and could be expanded at any\npoint with any type of malicious code.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Microsoft detects massive surge in Linux XorDDoS malware activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-detects-massive-surge-in-linux-xorddos-malware-activity/)\n\n[Microsoft: Sysrv botnet targets Windows, Linux servers with new exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sysrv-botnet-targets-windows-linux-servers-with-new-exploits/)\n\n[New cryptomining malware builds an army of Windows, Linux bots](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cryptomining-malware-builds-an-army-of-windows-linux-bots/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Emotet botnet switches to 64-bit modules, increases activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-switches-to-64-bit-modules-increases-activity/)\n\n[New stealthy BotenaGo malware variant targets DVR devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-stealthy-botenago-malware-variant-targets-dvr-devices/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a few\nmore.
