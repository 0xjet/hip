    "plain_text": "# Treasury Continues to Counter Ransomware as Part of Whole-of-Government Effort; Sanctions Ransomware Operators and Virtual Currency Exchange\n\n**home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0471**\n\nNovember 8, 2021\n\n_FinCEN Updates Ransomware Advisory_\n\n_OFAC Sanctions Two Ransomware Operators and a Virtual Currency Exchange Network for_\n_the Kaseya Incident and Laundering Cyber Ransoms_\n\nWASHINGTON — Continuing the Administration’s whole-of-government effort to counter\nransomware, the U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced a set of actions focused\non disrupting criminal ransomware actors and virtual currency exchanges that launder the\nproceeds of ransomware. Treasury’s actions today advance the Biden Administration’s\ncounter-ransomware efforts to disrupt ransomware infrastructure and actors and address\nabuse of the virtual currency ecosystem to launder ransom payments.\n\n“Ransomware groups and criminal organizations have targeted American businesses and\npublic institutions of all sizes and across sectors, seeking to undermine the backbone of our\neconomy,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “We will continue to bring\nto bear all of the authorities at Treasury’s disposal to disrupt, deter, and prevent future\nthreats to the economy of the United States. This is a top priority for the Biden\nAdministration.”\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware incidents have disrupted critical services and businesses globally, as well as\nschools, government offices, hospitals and emergency services, transportation, energy, and\nfood companies. Reported ransomware payments in the United States so far have reached\n$590 million in the first half of 2021, compared to a total of $416 million in 2020. The\nperpetrators behind these ransomware incidents seek to harm the United States and extort\nthe American people and our allies. Those who provide financial services to, or facilitate\nmoney laundering for, ransomware actors enable this illegal activity.\n\nWhile most virtual currency activity is licit, virtual currency remains the primary mechanism\nfor ransomware payments, and certain unscrupulous virtual currency exchanges are an\nimportant piece of the ransomware ecosystem. The United States urges the international\ncommunity to effectively implement international standards on anti-money\nlaundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) in the virtual currency area,\nparticularly regarding virtual currency exchanges.\n\nToday’s coordinated action with several U.S. government and foreign partners demonstrates\nhow Treasury’s international partnerships enhance the ability to detect and disrupt, across\ncontinents and technologies, the illicit financial activities of those who seek to harm people’s\nlivelihoods, savings, and futures for private gain.\n\n## Designation of a Virtual Currency Exchange and Network for Complicit Financial Services\n\nToday’s actions include the designation of Chatex, a virtual currency exchange, and its\nassociated support network, for facilitating financial transactions for ransomware actors.\nChatex, which claims to have a presence in multiple countries, has facilitated transactions for\nmultiple ransomware variants. Analysis of Chatex’s known transactions indicate that over half\nare directly traced to illicit or high-risk activities such as darknet markets, high-risk\nexchanges, and ransomware. Chatex has direct ties with SUEX OTC, S.R.O. (Suex), using\nSuex’s function as a nested exchange to conduct transactions. Suex was sanctioned on\nSeptember 21, 2021, for facilitating financial transactions for ransomware actors. Chatex is\nbeing designated pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended, for providing\nmaterial support to Suex and the threat posed by criminal ransomware actors.\n\nAdditionally, OFAC is designating IZIBITS OU, Chatextech SIA, and Hightrade Finance Ltd\nfor providing material support and assistance to Chatex, pursuant to E.O. 13694, as\namended. These three companies set up infrastructure for Chatex, enabling Chatex\noperations.\nComplementing this action, the Department of State announced a Transnational Organized\nCrime Reward offer of up to $10,000,000 for information leading to the identification or\nlocation of any individual(s) who hold a key leadership position in the Sodinokibi/REvil\nransomware variant transnational organized crime group (22 U.S.C. §2708(b)(6)). The\n\n\n-----\n\nDepartment of State also announced a reward offer of up to $5,000,000 for information\nleading to the arrest and/or conviction in any country of any individual conspiring to\nparticipate in or attempting to participate in a Sodinokibi variant ransomware incident.\n\nFollowing an inspection by Latvia’s State Revenue Service, Latvian government authorities\nhave suspended with immediate effect the operations of Chatextech; assessed a fine for\nbreaches of company registration and business conduct laws and regulations; and will\nidentify current and former Chatextech board members, all non-Latvian nationals, in Latvia’s\nregistry of high-risk individuals. In addition, the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit has\nrevoked the license of Izibits OU after working with the United States to identify the activities\nof entities being designated today.\n\nUnprincipled virtual currency exchanges like Chatex are critical to the profitability of\nransomware activities, especially by laundering and cashing out the proceeds for criminals.\nTreasury will continue to use all available authorities to disrupt malicious cyber actors, block\nill-gotten criminal proceeds, and deter additional actions against the American people.\nTreasury benefitted immensely from close coordination with our partners across Latvian and\nEstonian government agencies, including their information sharing and swift action.\n\n## Designation of Two Ransomware Operators\n\nOFAC is designating Ukrainian Yaroslav Vasinskyi (Vasinskyi) and Russian Yevgeniy\n**Polyanin (Polyanin) for their part in perpetuating Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware incidents**\nagainst the United States. Vasinskyi deployed ransomware against at least nine U.S.\ncompanies. Vasinskyi is also responsible for the July 2021 ransomware activity against\nKaseya, which caused significant disruptions to the computer networks of Kaseya’s customer\nbase. Polyanin also deployed ransomware, targeting several U.S. government entities and\nprivate-sector companies. These two individuals are part of a cybercriminal group that has\nengaged in ransomware activities and received more than $200 million in ransom payments\npaid in Bitcoin and Monero. OFAC is also designating a company owned by Polyanin,\npursuant to E.O. 13694 as amended. Malicious cyber activities against the U.S. government\nand private sector will be aggressively investigated and pursued. Companies are\nencouraged to report all ransomware incidents to law enforcement, as well as any payments\nwith a potential sanctions nexus to OFAC, and strengthen their cyber defense posture.\n\n## Sanctions Implications\n\nAs a result of today’s designation, all property and interests in property of the designated\ntargets that are subject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally\nprohibited from engaging in transactions with them. Additionally, any entities 50 percent or\nmore owned by one or more designated persons are also blocked. In addition, financial\ninstitutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the\n\n\n-----\n\nsanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an\nenforcement action. Today’s action does not implicate a sanctions nexus to any particular\nRansomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) or variant.\n\n## FinCEN Releases Updated Advisory on Ransomware and the Use of the Financial System to Facilitate Ransom Payments\n\nIn addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is releasing an update\ntoday to its 2020 Advisory on Ransomware and the Use of the Financial System to Facilitate\nRansom Payments. The updated Advisory reflects information released by FinCEN in its\nFinancial Trend Analysis Report discussing ransomware trends, issued on October 15, 2021,\nand includes information on current trends and typologies of ransomware and associated\npayments as well as recent examples of ransomware incidents. The updated Advisory also\nsets out financial red flag indicators of ransomware-related illicit activity to assist financial\ninstitutions, including virtual currency service providers, in identifying and reporting\nsuspicious transactions associated with ransomware payments, consistent with their\nobligations under the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\n[Click here to view identifying information on the individuals and entities designated today.](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20211108)\n\nClick here to view FinCEN’s Updated Advisory on Ransomware and the Use of the Financial\nSystem to Facilitate Ransom Payments.\n\n## For More Information on Ransomware\n\nPlease visit [StopRansomware.gov, a one-stop resource for individuals and organizations of](https://www.stopransomware.gov/)\nall sizes to reduce their risk of ransomware incidents and improve their cybersecurity\nresilience.
