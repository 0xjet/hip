The speed and\nerratic nature of these developments, along with the peculiar nature of the new admins’\ncommunications, have left many cybercriminal users suspicious as to the operators’ real\nintentions and credibility.\n\n## Frenetic Takeover of “Verified” Hacker Forum Leave Cybercriminals Wary\n\nOn February 17, 2021, the elite Russian hacker forum, “Verified,” resurfaced abruptly, stood\nup with new web domains and new, unnamed admins claiming ownership. The speed and\nerratic nature of these developments, along with the peculiar nature of the new admins’\n\n\n-----\n\ncommunications, have left many cybercriminal users suspicious as to the operators real\nintentions and credibility.\n\nFlashpoint analysts continue to investigate the Verified forum and are actively monitoring\nhacker chatter for any noticeable shifts in community behavior or sentiment.\n\n### Notorious Russian Hacker Forum Active for More Than a Decade\n\n[For well over a decade now, Verified has been among the top cybercriminal venues for](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/dark-web-marketplace-cybercrime-pricing-2020/)\nhighly-skilled Eastern European hackers and associates, who routinely flock to the site to\nconduct their illicit cyber operations.\n\n## New, Unnamed Operators Gain Control, Promise Changes\n\nAs new Verified-linked domains emerged online last week, an unknown group of nameless\nadministrators claimed to usurp control of the long-standing forum. Following their successful\ntakeover, the new admins notified all Verified forum users of this news, making use of the\nprevious admin alias “VR_Support” to alert the entire forum community. They explained the\nreason for their abrupt takeover, claiming that the prior admins locked them out of Verified’s\nformer domains. Upon gaining access to Verified’s admin panel, they allegedly found the\nforum’s networking infrastructure in disarray with little to no security or user protections of\nnote.\n\nThe new operators purport that Verified’s inadequate site security propelled them into action\nto seize control, further asserting that the former site domain (verified[.]sc) had been hacked.\nThey promised to share screenshots as proof, but as of the writing of this post, that evidence\nhas yet to materialize.\n\n## Dubious Timing and No New Inventory Add to Cybercriminal Suspicions\n\nThe new admins also announced additional operational changes to the forum: They plan to\ndeactivate the forum’s former Jabber support servers and will offer free registration to all\nusers for an extended period of time to encourage swift adoption of the new domains. While\nthe renewed flurry of admin activity may reassure some cybercriminal users, many remain\nskeptical due to the dubious timing of it all and the lack of new forum data since January 20,\n2021—which, coincidently or not, is the same date as the site’s claimed seizure and\nownership transfer.\n\n### Former Verified Operators’ Continued Silence Is Deafening\n\nFurther confounding forum users and cybercriminal onlookers alike, the former admins of the\nold Verified domain have not yet acknowledged the seizure and transfer of Verified anywhere\nonline. No one has even copped to connectivity issues or other technical malfunctions that\n\n\n-----\n\nact at least as a partial explanation for all of this frantic movement.\n\n## Cybercriminal Suspicion Loud and Well-Founded\n\nNeedless to say, the frenetic pace of activity and the suspect narrative meant to ease user\ntrepidation may have done just the opposite, deepening their concerns rather than alleviating\nthem. Some savvy Verified cybercriminal users clearly have their eyebrows raised as they\ncomment on the new admins’ posts with skeptical reactions, mentions of “fake news,” and\nexpletive-laden posts trolling the new management.\n\nUsers on the rival Russian-language hacker forum “Exploit” have also expressed their own\ndisbelief about the dubious Verified domain and administration changes. In the wake of\n[several recent high-profile US-EU joint law enforcement campaigns targeting other](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/jokers-stash-gone-whats-next-in-card-fraud-cybercrime/)\nprominent Eastern European cybercriminal syndicates and illicit dark web marketplaces with\noperations stemming back to places like Bulgaria and Ukraine—perhaps, these suspicions\nare well-justified.\n\n## See Flashpoint Intelligence in Action\n\nWhy wait?
