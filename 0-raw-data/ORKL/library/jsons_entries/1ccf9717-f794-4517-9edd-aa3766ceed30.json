    "plain_text": "# Crypto stealing campaign spread via fake cracked software\n\n**blog.avast.com/fakecrack-campaign**\n\nUsers who download cracked software risk sensitive personal data being stolen by hackers.\n\nAre you interested in downloading free, cracked software? If so, you should know what\nyou’re getting into.\n\nWhen you accidentally download malicious cracked software, attackers can take everything\nyou have on your PC, and you’ll end up without your sensitive personal data and even\nwithout the software that you were trying to download in the first place. This is precisely how\nthe newly emerged FakeCrack campaign is doing its business, enticing users into\ndownloading fake cracked software. The bad actors behind the campaign have utilized a\n[vast infrastructure to deliver malware and steal personal and other sensitive data, including](https://www.avast.com/c-topic-malware)\n[crypto assets. Interested in knowing more? Let’s dive a bit deeper.](https://blog.avast.com/beware-of-a-new-amazon-token-crypto-scam)\n\n## Delivery infrastructure\n\nThe infection chain starts on dubious sites that supposedly offer cracked versions of wellknown and used software, such as games, office programs, or programs for downloading\nmultimedia content. All these sites are placed in the highest positions in search engine\n\n\n-----\n\nresults. The vast majority of the results on the first page lead to compromised crack sites,\nand users end up downloading malware instead of the crack. This technique is known as the\nBlack SEO mechanism exploiting search engine indexing techniques.\n\nNext, a link leads to an extensive infrastructure that delivers malware. What's interesting\nabout this infrastructure is its scale. After clicking on the link, the user is redirected through a\nnetwork of domains to the landing page. These domains have a similar pattern and are\nregistered on Cloudflare using a few name servers. The first type of domain uses the pattern\n_freefilesXX.xyz, where XX are digits. This domain usually only serves as a redirector. The_\nredirect leads to another page using the cfd top-level domain. These cfd domains serve as a\nredirector as well as a landing page. Overall, Avast has protected roughly 10,000 users from\nbeing infected daily who are located primarily in Brazil, India, Indonesia, and France.\n\n_Figure 1: Protected users on the whole delivery infrastructure (1 day period)_\n\nThe landing page has different visual forms. All of them offer a link to a legitimate file share\nplatform, which contains a malware ZIP file. The file sharing services abused in this\ncampaign include, for example, the Japanese file sharing filesend.jp or mediafire.com. An\nexample of the landing page is shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Landing page_\n\n## Delivered malware\n\nAfter accessing the provided link, the ZIP file is downloaded. This ZIP is encrypted with a\nsimple password (usually 1234) which prevents the file from being analyzed by antivirus\nsoftware. This ZIP usually contains a single executable file, typically named setup.exe or\n_cracksetup.exe. We collected eight different executables that were distributed by this_\ncampaign.\n\nThese eight samples exhibit stealers' activities, focusing on scanning the user's PC and\ncollecting private information from the browsers, such as passwords or credit card data. Data\nfrom electronic wallets are also being collected. The data has been exfiltrated in encrypted\nZIP format to C2 servers. However, the ZIP file encryption key is hardcoded into the binary,\nso getting the content is not difficult. The encrypted ZIP contains all information mentioned\npreviously, like the information about the system, installed software, screenshot and data\ncollected from the browser including passwords or private data of crypto extensions.\n\n_Figure 3: Exfiltered data in ZIP_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Zip password hardcoded in the binary_\n\n## Persistence techniques\n\nThe delivered stealer malware using two persistence techniques. Both of these techniques\nwere exclusively targeted at stealing crypto-related information, which we’ll now describe in\nmore detail.\n\n### Clipboard changer technique\n\nIn addition to stealing sensitive personal information as described above, some of the\nsamples also preserved persistence by dropping two additional files. The AutoIt compiler for\nthe case is not present on the user’s computer and the AutoIt script. The script has been\nusually dropped to the AppData\\Roaming\\ServiceGet\\ folder and scheduled to run\nautomatically at a predefined time.\n\nThis script is quite large and very heavily obfuscated, but after a closer examination, it does\nonly a few elementary operations. For one, it periodically checks the content of the clipboard.\nWhen it detects the presence of the crypto wallet address in the clipboard, it changes the\nvalue of the clipboard to the wallet address under the attacker’s control. The protection\nmechanism also deletes the script after three successful changes of the wallet address in the\nclipboard. The figure below shows the deobfuscated version of the part of the script.\n\nThe periodic_clipboard_checks function is being called in an infinite loop. Each call of the\n_check_clipboard function checks the presence of the wallet address in the clipboard and_\nchanges its content to the attacker’s controlled address. The attacker is prepared for various\ncrypto wallets, ranging from Terra, Nano, Ronin, or Bitcoincash. The numeric parameters in\nthe check_clipboard function are not important and serve only for optimizations.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Dropped AutoIt script_\n\nIn total, we identified 37 different wallets for various cryptocurrencies. Some of them were\nalready empty, and some of them we could not identify. However, we checked these wallets\non the blockchain and we estimate that the attacker earned at least $50,000. Moreover, if we\nomit the massive drop in the price of the Luna crypto in recent days, it was almost $60,000 in\napproximately a one month period.\n\n### Proxy stealing technique\n\nThe second interesting technique that we observed in connection with this campaign was the\nuse of proxies to steal credentials and other sensitive data from some crypto marketplaces.\nAttackers were able to set up an IP address to download a malicious Proxy Auto\n\n-----\n\nConfiguration script (PAC). By setting this IP address in the system, every time the victim\naccesses any of the listed domains, the traffic is redirected to a proxy server under the\nattacker’s control.\n\nThis type of attack is quite unusual in the context of the crypto stealing activity; however, it is\nvery easy to hide it from the user, and the attacker can observe the victim's traffic at given\ndomains for quite a long time without being noticed. The figure below shows the content of\nthe Proxy Autoconfiguration Script set up by an attacker. Traffic to Binance, Huobi, and OKX\ncryptomarkets is being redirected to the attacker’s controlled IP address.\n\n_Figure 6: Proxy autoconfig script_\n\n## How to remove the proxy settings\n\nThis campaign is dangerous mainly due to its extension. As it was shown at the beginning,\nthe attacker managed to get the compromised sites to high positions in search results. The\nnumber of protected users also shows that this campaign is quite widespread. If you suspect\nyour computer has been compromised, check the proxy settings and remove malicious\nsettings using the following procedure.\n\nThe proxy settings must be removed manually by using the following guidelines:\n\nRemove AutoConfigURL registry key in the\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\n\nAlternatively, using GUI:\n\nClick on the Start Menu.\nType Settings and hit enter.\nGo to Network & Internet -> Proxy.\nDelete Script Address and click on the Save button.\nDisable the “Use a proxy server” option.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor this campaign, cybercriminals abuse the brand names of popular software, by promoting\nillegal, seemingly cracked versions of them to lure users into downloading the malware.\nBrand names abused for this campaign are for example \"CCleaner Pro Windows\", but also\n\"Microsoft Office\", “Movavi Video Editor 22.2.1 Crack\" \"IDM Download Free Full Version With\nSerial Key\" \"Movavi Video Editor 22.2.1 Crack\" \"Crack Office 2016 Full Crack + Product Key\n(Activator) 2022\". We recommend users to always stick to official software versions instead\nof cracked versions.\n\nThanks to Martin Hanzlik, a high school student intern who participated in tracking this\ncampaign and significantly contributed to this blog post.\n\n## IoC\n\n Delivery infrastructure\n\ngoes12by[.]cfd baed92all[.]cfd aeddkiu6745q[.]cfd 14redirect[.]cfd\n\nlixn62ft[.]cfd kohuy31ng[.]cfd wae23iku[.]cfd yhf78aq[.]cfd\n\nxzctn14il[.]cfd mihatrt34er[.]cfd oliy67sd[.]cfd er67ilky[.]cfd\n\nbny734uy[.]cfd uzas871iu[.]cfd dert1mku[.]cfd fr56cvfi[.]cfd\n\nasud28cv[.]cfd freefiles34[.]xyz freefiles33[.]xyz wrtgh56mh[.]cfd\n\n### Malware\n\n**SHA-256**\n\nbcb1c06505c8df8cf508e834be72a8b6adf67668fcf7076cd058b37cf7fc8aaf\n\nc283a387af09f56ba55d92a796edcfa60678e853b384f755313bc6f5086be4ee\n\nac47ed991025f58745a3ca217b2091e0a54cf2a99ddb0c98988ec7e5de8eac6a\n\n5423be642e040cfa202fc326027d878003128bff5dfdf4da6c23db00b5942055\n\n\n-----\n\nc283a387af09f56ba55d92a796edcfa60678e853b384f755313bc6f5086be4ee\n\n9254436f13cac035d797211f59754951b07297cf1f32121656b775124547dbe7\n\n5423be642e040cfa202fc326027d878003128bff5dfdf4da6c23db00b5942055\n\n9d66a6a6823aea1b923f0c200dfecb1ae70839d955e11a3f85184b8e0b16c6f8\n\n### Stealer C2 and exfiltration servers\n\n**IP Address**\n\n185[.]250.148.76\n\n45[.]135.134.211\n\n194[.]180.174.180\n\n45[.]140.146.169\n\n37[.]221.67.219\n\n94[.]140.114.231\n\n### Clipboard changer script\n\n**SHA-256**\n\n97f1ae6502d0671f5ec9e28e41cba9e9beeffcc381aae299f45ec3fcc77cdd56\n\n### Malicious proxy server\n\n**IP**\n\n\n-----\n\n104[.]155.207.188\n\n**SHA-256**\n\ne5286671048b1ef44a4665c091ad6a9d1f77d6982cf4550b3d2d3a9ef1e24bc7\n\n\n-----",
