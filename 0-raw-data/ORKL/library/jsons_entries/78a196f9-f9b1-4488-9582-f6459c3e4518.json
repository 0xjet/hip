It is known for using blogs and microblogging\nservices to hide the location of its actual command-and-control (C&C) servers. This allows an\nattacker to change the C&C server used quickly by changing the information in these posts.\n\n\n-----\n\ng g p g,\nthat are used as part of its infection routines are now in Japanese. Secondly, it is now using\nblogging sites and microblogging services based in Japan for its C&C activity.\n\nThis post will discuss this C&C routine, the tools used in these attacks, and the connections\nbetween these tools.\n\n**C&C configuration retrieval**\n\nFigure 1. Overview of C&C configuration retrieval method\n\nBackdoors used by BLACKGEAR share a common characteristic: they all retrieve encrypted\nC&C configuration information from blogs or microblogs. An attacker would register an\naccount on these services and then create posts. The encrypted C&C information would be\nbetween two hardcoded tags, as seen below:\n\nFigure 2. Encrypted configuration information between tags\n\nThere are two reasons BLACKGEAR would use this technique. First, the beacon traffic of the\nbackdoor would look like normal traffic to blogs. Secondly, the threat actor would be able to\nquickly change the C&C servers used if these were blocked. A defender would be unable to\nblock this change in server from reaching any affected machines unless the legitimate site\nwas blocked as well.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Tools used by BLACKGEAR campaign\n\nThe malware tools used by BLACKGEAR can be categorized into three categories: binders,\ndownloaders and backdoors. Binders are delivered by attack vectors (such as phishing and\nwatering hole attacks) onto a machine. These, in turn, drop decoys and downloaders. The\nlatter connect to various sites under the control of the attacker and downloads backdoors.\nThese use persistent methods to ensure that they remain present on the affected machines to\ngive attackers access to the machine in question.\n\nBy separating the attack tools into three stages, threat actors are able to adapt quickly. If one\ncomponent is detected and/or blocked, it can be replaced without disrupting the entire\ntoolset.\n\n**Binder**\n\nThe binder (which we detect as the TROJ_BLAGFLDR family) hides as a normal folder by\nchanging its icon to a folder icon. Once the victim executes it, it executes the downloader in\nthe background, drops a decoy folder that includes fake documents, then delete itself. This is\nso the victim won’t notice that the malicious downloader has been executed.\n\n**Downloader**\n\nTSPY_RAMNY\n\nTSPY_RAMNY is a downloader dropped by TROJ_BLAGFLDR malware. To remain persistent, it\nmoves itself to the Windows temp folder and drops a *.lnk (Windows Shortcut) file in the startup\nfolder that points to itself. It also sends information about the compromised host (such as\nnetwork settings) back to the download site.\n\nThe download link is formatted in the following format:\n\nhttp://{IP address}/{folder name}/{webpage name} (Example: http://{IP\naddress}/multi/index.html)\n\nThis is done so that if someone looks solely at the URL, the download of the backdoor will\nappear to be an ordinary website.\n\nTSPY_YMALRMINI\n\nTSPY_YMALRMINI is another downloader that is dropped by TROJ_BLAGFLDR malware, which\nalso sends information about compromised hosts back to the download site We were unable\n\n\n-----\n\ny, g p\nTSPY_YMALRMINI uses the same URL format as RAMNY.\n\nTSPY_YMALRMINI has the same download link pattern as TSPY_RAMNY. The family name for this\nmalware is because some variants have the PDB string “C:\\toolson-mini\\YmailerCreater –\nDebug\\Binder\\Binder\\YMailer.pdb”. In addition, these variants also create a log file\nnamed YmailerMini.log.\n\n**Backdoors**\n\nBKDR_ELIRKS\n\nBKDR_ELIRKS was the first family of backdoors tied to BLACKGEAR. It retrieves encrypted C&C\nconfiguration information from various blogging or microblogging services. Once decoded, it\nconnects to these C&C servers and waits for commands given by a threat actor. To remain\npersistent, it moves itself to the Windows temp folder and drops a *.lnk (Windows Shortcut) file\nin the startup folder that points to itself.\n\nIts backdoor routines include getting information from the compromised host, downloading\nand running files, taking screenshots, and opening a remote shell.\n\nBKDR_YMALR\n\nBKDR_YMALR is a backdoor written using the .NET framework which is also known as\nLOGEDRUT. The detection name comes from a log file created by this malware family\nnamed YMailer.log. Its behavior is similar to ELIRKS – both in terms of C&C information retrieval\nand available commands to a threat actor.\n\n**Encryption and Decryption**\n\nBKDR_ELIRKS\n\nReverse analysis of ELIRKS allowed us to determine how to decrypt the C&C information,\nwhich is done in the following Python code:\n\n#! /usr/bin/env python\n\nfrom ctypes import *\n\ndef decipher(v, k):\ny=c_uint32(v[0])\nz=c_uint32(v[1])\nsum=c_uint32(0xC6EF3720)\ndelta=c_uint32(0x61C88647)\nn=32\nw=[0,0]\n\nwhile(n>0):\nz.value -= (y.value + sum.value) ^ (y.value * 16 + k[2]) ^ (( y.value >> 5 ) + k[3])\ny.value -= (z.value + sum.value) ^ (z.value * 16 + k[0]) ^ (( z.value >> 5 ) + k[1])\nsum.value += delta.value\nn -= 1\n\nw[0]=y.value\nw[1]=z.value\n\nreturn w\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\nkey = [0x8F3B39F1, 0x8D3FBD96, 0x473EAA92, 0x502E41D2]\nciphertext = [ciphertext1, ciphertext2] # you can input cipher text here\nres = decipher(ciphertext, key)\nplaintext = \"%X\" % (res[0])\nc4 = str(int(\"0x\"+plaintext[6:8],16))\nc3 = str(int(\"0x\"+plaintext[4:6],16))\nc2 = str(int(\"0x\"+plaintext[2:4],16))\n\nc1 = str(int(\"0x\"+plaintext[:2] 16))\n\n\n-----\n\ny\nblog/microblog posts are downloaded, the malware finds and decrypts the C&C information.\n\nThe C&C information is stored in the post in two short bits of text. The first is an eight-character\nstring that is decoded into a six-byte hexadecimal value. The second is a two-character string\nwhich is already in a hexadecimal format, and is concatenated towards the end. A modified\nversion of the [TEA algorithm decrypts these into the C&C server locations.](https://web.archive.org/web/20070127094759/http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~matthew/TEA/)\n\nFigure 4. BKDR_ELIRKS decryption algorithm\n\nBKDR_YMALR\n\nBKDR_YMALR implements the same behavior in a slightly different manner. It contains several\nencrypted strings:\n\nFigure 5. Encrypted strings in BKDR_YMALR\n\nThese encrypted strings are the result of the blog URLs and tags being first encoded\nwith Base64, and then encrypted with DES. The encryption key and initialization vector are\nhardcoded, with both set to 1q2w3e4r. (Note how these are positioned on a normal\nkeyboard.)\n\nFigure 6. Blog URL and tags in BKDR_YMALR\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. BKDR_YMALR decryption algorithm\n\nOnce these have been decoded, BKDR_YMALR uses the same algorithm as ELIRKS to obtain\nthe C&C information.\n\nFigure 8. BKDR_YMALR configuration from the blog post blog\n\n**Connections between tools**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Connections between tools\n\nMore than just tools being used together, it appears that there are distinct connections\nbetween the different tools used by BLACKGEAR. The string “YMailer” shows up in the\nfilenames of log files used by both BKDR_YMALR and TSPY_YMALRMINI, and it is in the PDB\nstrings of the latter. The two downloaders TSPY_RLMNY and TSPY_YMALRMINI both use the\nstring toolson in different places. Lastly, both downloaders and one backdoor share the same\ndecryption key 1q2w3e4r. The above illustration shows the connections between the families.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMalware threats need to evolve or otherwise become non-threats. Similarly, to stay relevant,\nBLACKGEAR has evolved with both new tools and new targets, and will continue to be a\nthreat for the foreseeable future. We will continue to monitor its activities in order to protect\nour customers.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise
