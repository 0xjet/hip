TPLink-Routers RCE](https://sekurak.pl/tp-link-httptftp-backdoor/)\n[2. Netgear RCE](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43055/)\n[3. (new) AVTECH RCE](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40500/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[4. (new) CISCO Linksys Router RCE](https://vuldb.com/?id.12362)\n[5. (new) JAW/1.0 RCE](https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/pwning-cctv-cameras/)\n[6. (new) OrientDB RCE](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42965/)\n[7. (new) CouchDB RCE](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44913/)\n\nAs a side-effect for adding more payloads, HNS is also noisier now, as it needs to scan\nmore ports to find new hosts to infect. Experts say they've seen HNS bots initiating scans\non ports:\n\n**23   Telnet**\n**80   HTTP Web Service**\n**2480 OrientDB**\n**5984 CouchDB**\n**8080 HTTP Web Service**\n... but also random ports\n\nBut HNS was easy to spot anyway because it's only the second major IoT botnet besides\nHajime known to use a P2P structure, so security researchers would have an easy time\nidentifying it regardless.\n\n## HNS testing coinminer payload\n\nHNS is not the first botnet to target OrientDB servers, which have become quite the favorite\n[among various botnets. For example, DDG, a botnet discovered last year, which is](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mining-botnet-targeting-redis-and-orientdb-servers-made-almost-1-million/) still alive\ntoday, has targeted OrientDB servers in the past with cryptocurrency-mining malware.\n\nIn fact, it appears that HNS operators might have learned something from the DDG crew\nbecause Netlab says HNS has also started dropping a coinminer payload on some of the\ninfected systems.\n\nFortunately, for the time being, it appears that these deployments have all failed, as the\nadditional coinminer payload failed to start and generate funds for the HNS operators.\n\nBut if they manage to get it up and running, they'll be in for some profits, as the DDG gang\ncollected well over $1 million from their coinmining last year.\n\n_[The Netlab team has published an in-depth analysis of the changes in HNS compared to its](http://blog.netlab.360.com/hns-botnet-recent-activities-en/)_\n_previous variant spotted back in January._\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New cryptomining malware builds an army of Windows, Linux bots](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cryptomining-malware-builds-an-army-of-windows-linux-bots/)\n\n[Microsoft detects massive surge in Linux XorDDoS malware activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-detects-massive-surge-in-linux-xorddos-malware-activity/)\n\n[Microsoft: Sysrv botnet targets Windows Linux servers with new exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sysrv-botnet-targets-windows-linux-servers-with-new-exploits/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Popular NFT marketplace Rarible targeted by scammers and malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/popular-nft-marketplace-rarible-targeted-by-scammers-and-malware/)\n\n[Emotet botnet switches to 64-bit modules, increases activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-switches-to-64-bit-modules-increases-activity/)\n\n[Botnet](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/botnet/)\n[Coinminer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/coinminer/)\n[CryptoCurrency](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cryptocurrency/)\n[IoT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/iot/)\n[Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a\nfew more.
