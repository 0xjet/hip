    "plain_text": "# New Voldemort/Nagini Ransomware Virus Infection\n\n**[bestsecuritysearch.com/voldemortnagini-ransomware-virus/](http://bestsecuritysearch.com/voldemortnagini-ransomware-virus/)**\n\nAlex Dimchev September 27, 2016\n\n**A new ransomware by the name of Voldemort(or Nagini) has appeared. It’s yet another**\n**dangerous virus with a goofy exterior. The virus locks the screen of infected**\n**computers and puts a picture of Lord Voldemort as a wallpaper. The virus doesn’t add**\n**extensions to encrypted files.**\n\n## Voldemort Ransomware Virus – What To Expecto?\n\n[The virus was discovered by Michael Gillespie. The virus was named after a few files](https://twitter.com/demonslay335/status/780072894126632960)\nreferencing Voldemort, the main villain of the Harry Potter franchise. One of the virus’s file\nnames is “Nagini.exe.” Another is named voldemort.horcrux.\n\n**Voldemort Ransomware is still in development as of now, but a finished version may be**\nreleased soon. The virus will most likely be distributed with the help of email spam (not owl\nmail, sadly.) The virus is developed by someone called “Colosseum.” It’s unknown is it’s a\nsingle person or a group of malware developers.\n\n## Voldemort Ransomware – Technical details\n\nThe Voldemort virus uses a strong RSA encryption algorithm. The ransomware includes\ninstructions to its victims. The message reads:\n\n\n-----\n\nDone Encrypting!\nEnter your credit card:\nGet key!\nEnter key to decrypt the files:\nDecrypt Now!\n\n**Voldemort ransomware aims to encrypt specific files. The extensions targeted the virus are:**\n\n.bmp, .doc, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .pdf, .pptx, .xls, .xlsx, .exe\n\nOnce the victim PC is infected, Voldemort will create its files in the following directories:\n\nC:\\Temp\\voldemort.horcrux\n*Username*\\1.exe\n*Username*\\Nagini.exe\n\nThe virus remains fairly mysterious as of now. There’s not a lot of data to go on since\n**Voldemort isn’t widely distributed yet.**\n\n## Voldemort Ransomware Virus – Conclusion\n\nDon’t underestimate Voldemort just because of its name. The virus can prove very\ndangerous if the crooks behind it start a distribution campaign. Voldemort isn’t the only virus\nwith a weird name. Here are a few examples of the cyber-criminal imagination:\n\n[Hitler Ransomware – A fake ransomware virus named after the Führer.](https://bestsecuritysearch.com/hitler-ransomware-remove-unlock-screen/)\n[PokemonGo ransomware – a Pikachu-faced ransomware virus masking as the hit app](https://bestsecuritysearch.com/pokemongo-exe-ransomware-masking-hit-app/)\n[Bart2 – a virus named after the brat from The Simpsons](https://bestsecuritysearch.com/bart2-ransomware-infection/)\n\nJust in case the virus proves dangerous, we’ll leave malware removal instructions at the end\nof this article. With their help, you’ll be able to combat the Voldemort/Nagini ransomware\nvirus. There’s no magic spell that can remove Voldemort ransomware. If you want to remove\nit, you’re going to have to go the muggle route and download an anti-malware tool or remove\nit by hand.\n\nRead: [New Trojan Downloader – Distributes Locky and Pony](https://bestsecuritysearch.com/new-trojan-locky-pony/)\n\n**Try to Load Your PC in Safe Mode**\n\nFor various Windows OS’s:\n\n**1) Hit WIN Key + R**\n\n\n-----\n\n**2) A Run window will appear. In it, write “msconfig” and then press Enter.**\n\n**3) A Configuration box shall appear. In it Choose the menu named “Boot”.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**4) Choose the Safe Boot preference and then go to Network under it to tick it.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Eliminate the malicious processes**\n\n1) hit the following key combination: CTRL+ESC+SHIFT\n\n2) Get over to Processes.\n\n3) Choose the suspicious process if you have found it and then right click it after which click\non “Open File Location.”\n\n4) End the malicious process by again right-clicking and choosing “End Process”.\n\n**Delete registry objects created by the Voldemort ransomware virus.**\n\n**For all Windows versions:**\n\n1) Again type simultaneously the Windows Button + R. key combination.\n\n2) In the type box, write “regedit”(without the inverted comas) and hit Enter.\n\n3) Type the CTRL+F key combination and then write the malicious name in the search type\nfield to locate the malicious executable.\n\n4) In case you have discovered registry keys and values related to the name, you should\ndelete them, but be careful not to delete legitimate keys.\n\n**Recover files encrypted by Voldemort.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**If you want to try recovering files yourself, you have several options:**\n**Option One: By using Windows’s System Restore**\n1) Hit the Windows Button + R. key combination.\n2) After the “Run” Window pops up, write “rstrui” and hit on the Enter button.\n3) Choose a restore point and continue.\n\n_IMPORTANT: If you want to be more effective, we strongly suggest booting in safe mode if_\n_you are to do this!_\n\n**Option Two: By using Windows’s Shadow Volume Copies**\n\nTo access shadow volume copies you may require a program, like Shadow Explorer. Install\nit, open it and make it scan for shadow copies. If you have them enabled, this method will\nwork, in case the crypto-virus has not deleted them.\n\n**Option Three: By using various Recovery Software**\n\nThis option will not ensure maximum effectiveness and recovery rate but still, you may\nrestore several files. Most data recovery programs are available for free online, simply\nGoogle “Data Recovery Software”.\n\n**Prevent viruses from damaging your files in the future.**\n\nTo protect your important data, we suggest that you store it in the cloud. Programs that\nmakes online backup possible also enable you to schedule auto backup on different time\nperiods and this way, even if you lose your data, you can find it uploaded in securely\nencrypted account, access to which only you have.\n\n### Was this content helpful?\n\nShare your opinion and help us improve our guides.\n\n\n-----",
