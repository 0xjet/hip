TA453 (aka CHARMING KITTEN and\nPHOSPHORUS) has historically aligned with Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)\ncollection priorities, targeting dissidents, academics, diplomats, and journalists. This\nlatest campaign, dubbed BadBlood, is a deviation from the group’s usual activity. [1,2,3]\nWhile this campaign may represent a shift in TA453 targeting overall, it is also possible it\nmay be the result of a specific short term intelligence collection requirement. BadBlood is\naligned with an escalating trend of medical research being increasingly targeted by threat\nactors.\n\nProofpoint researchers have named this campaign BadBlood based on the medical focus\nand continued geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel.\n\n**Credential Phishing Campaign**\n\nIn this December 2020 campaign, TA453 used an actor-controlled Gmail account that\nmasqueraded as a prominent Israeli physicist. The account\n(zajfman.daniel[@]gmail.com) sent messages with the subject \"Nuclear weapons at a\nglance: Israel\" and contained social engineering lures relating to Israeli nuclear\ncapabilities. These malicious emails contained a link to the TA453-controlled domain\n1drv[.]casa. When clicked, the URL leads to a landing site spoofing Microsoft's OneDrive\nservice along with an image of a PDF document logo titled CBP-9075.pdf.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: TA453 Landing Site with PDF Document Logo_\n\nWhen a user attempts to view and download the PDF document, 1drv[.]casa delivers a\nforged Microsoft login page which attempts to harvest user credentials. Attempting to use\nany other hyperlink in the webpage results in the same redirect to the same forged\nMicrosoft login page, except for the \"Create one!\" link. This tab leads to the legitimate\nMicrosoft Outlook “Sign Up” page at hxxps://signup.live[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: TA453 Credential Harvesting Page at 1drv[.] casa_\n\nOnce an email is entered by the user and “Next” is clicked, the page prompts for a\npassword.\n\nOnce a user enters their credentials, they are then redirected to Microsoft’s OneDrive\nwhere the benign \"Nuclear weapons at a glance: Israel\" document is hosted.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Microsoft OneDrive TA453 Benign Document_\n\nAt this time, it does not appear 1drv[.]casa conducts any sort of multi-factor\nauthentication bypass. Although Proofpoint does not currently have further visibility into\nhow TA453 used any credentials obtained from this specific campaign, public reporting\nfrom CERTFA indicates TA453 has previously used harvested credentials to exfiltrate\nemail inbox contents.[4] In select prior campaigns, Iranian-aligned actors, including\nTA453, have used compromised accounts for further phishing.[5]\n\n**Targeting**\n\nTA453 targeted less than 25 senior professionals at a variety of medical research\norganizations located in the US and Israel. Proofpoint analysis of the targets’ publicly\navailable research efforts and resumes indicate TA453 targeted individuals with a\nbackground in either genetics, oncology, or neurology. These medical professionals\nappear to be extremely senior personnel at a variety of medical research organizations.\nAdditionally, TA453 targeting Israeli organizations and individuals is consistent with\nincreased geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran during 2020. [6]\n\nAt this time, Proofpoint cannot conclusively determine the motivation of actors\nconducting these campaigns. As collaboration for medical research is often conducted\ninformally over email, this campaign may demonstrate that a subset of TA453 operators\nhave an intelligence requirement to collect specific medical information related to\ngenetic, oncology, or neurology research. Alternatively, this campaign may demonstrate\nan interest in the patient information of the targeted medical personnel or an aim to use\nthe recipients' accounts in further phishing campaigns. While this campaign may\nrepresent a shift in TA453 targeting overall, it is also possible it may be an outlier,\nreflective of a specific priority intelligence tasking given to TA453.\n\n**Attribution**\n\nWhile Proofpoint cannot independently attribute TA453 to the IRGC, the tactics and\ntechniques observed in BadBlood continue to mirror those used in historic TA453\ncampaigns and the overall targeting of TA453 campaigns detected by Proofpoint appear\nto support IRGC intelligence collection priorities.[7]\n\nIn 2019, the US Department of Justice indicted four Iranian individuals for using social\nmedia and credential phishing emails to conduct malicious computer intrusions on behalf\nof the IRGC.[8] Private industry reporting identified this activity as part of CHARMING\nKITTEN in both 2017 and 2019.[9,10] In early 2019, Microsoft reported TA453 was\nabusing well known email brands to conduct spearphishing operations against\ngovernment agencies, political targets, and journalists on behalf of the Iranian\ngovernment.[11]\n\n**Related Infrastructure**\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile investigating this campaign, Proofpoint Threat Research identified other domains\nattributed to TA453 with high confidence based on network infrastructure components,\ncampaign timing, and similarity in lure documents. Both Proofpoint and VirusTotal\ntelemetry indicated additional actor-controlled domains were used in TA453 campaigns\nattempted to compromise more traditional TA453 targets with a similar attack-chain in\nlate December 2020. Finally, the provided lure documents at the end of the attack chain\nshare similar, national security themes, including Congressional Research Reports, think\ntank publications, and other policy minded documents. While researchers were not able\nto directly correlate all of these domains with phishing campaigns, we judge this activity\nto be consistent with the BadBlood campaign.\n\n_Figure 4: Diagram of Related Infrastructure_\n\n_Figure 5: Final 1drv[.]xyz Lure “Reviving The Revolutionaries Document”_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Final 1drv[.]surf Lure Congressional Research Service Document_\n\n**Outlook**\n\nWhile TA453 has consistently demonstrated a desire to collect and exfiltrate the email\nmailbox contents belonging to typical intelligence targets of the Iranian government like\nthe Iranian diaspora, policy analysts, and educators, this TA453 campaign demonstrated\na desire to target medical researchers and providers. Further detection and analysis of\nTA453 campaigns will likely determine whether this targeting is an outlier or if targeting\nhas evolved to support the medical sector becoming a consistent intelligence requirement\nand target for TA453.\n\nWhile targeting medical experts in genetics, neurology and oncology may not be a lasting\nshift in TA453 targeting, it does indicate at least a temporary change in TA453 collection\npriorities. BadBlood is aligned with an escalating trend globally of medical research being\nincreasingly targeted by espionage motivated focused threat actors.
