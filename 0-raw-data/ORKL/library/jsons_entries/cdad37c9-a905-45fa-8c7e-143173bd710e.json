Its variants continue to find new](https://labs.k7computing.com/index.php/no-joking-around-with-joker/)\ntricks and tactics to stay undetected by doing small changes in its code or changing the payload download\ntechniques.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Malicious Joker Apps from Google Play Store\nThe following Joker samples were discovered recently on Google Play store which have now been removed.\n\nAll Document Scanner\nColor Call Flash- Call Screen\nClean Wallpaper\nFree BP Recorder\nFree Chat SMS\nFree Document Scanner\nFree Super Scanner\nFree Writing Message\nFree Secret Message\nPDF Scanner Master\nTime Zone Camera\nText Emoji Messages\nTeddy love wallpapers\nUnique Heart Rate Monitor\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nIn this blog, we will be analyzing the new Joker sample com.camera.phototimezonecamera. It is clear\nfrom Figure 2 that this new piece of Joker has adapted to multistage dex file loading; as the class name of a\nservice declared in the AndroidManifest.xml file is not defined in the classes.dex in the APK’s root folder.\nThis technique has not been seen in any of the previous Joker malware samples.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Undefined Class Name in AndroidManifest.xml\nThis means that the class not mentioned in the classes.dex would be loaded in memory at run-time using\nany one of the dynamic loading techniques.\n\nOnce launched, the malicious Android Package (APK) retrieves first level malicious payload, “a”, a .jar file\n(containing the payload dex) from grouplearn[.shop as shown in Figure 3, which enables the parent\nmalware with additional malevolent capabilities.\n\nFigure 3: Malicious First Level Payload from C2\nThis first level payload has a base64 encoded URL to download the next payload as shown in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4: Reference to the second payload in base64 encoded format\nThe second payload,”w.iov”, again a .jar file, downloaded from implemente[.life as shown in the Figure 4,\nhas the class reference of “okhttp3.service” class from the AndroidManifest.xml of\n**com.camera.phototimezonecamera as shown in Figure 5.**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Defined Class Name from AndoridManifest.xml\n\nThis Joker sample attempts to intercept incoming SMS messages and subscribe to the paid premium\nservices as shown in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6: Intercept SMS Messages\n\n## Mitigations\n\nAlways use the Official App Store to download apps\nCarefully read the user reviews before installing the apps\nEnsure you protect your device and data by using a reputable security product like K7 Mobile Security\nand keeping it up-to-date, to scan all the downloaded apps, irrespective of the source\n\nAt K7 Labs, we are constantly protecting our users with near real-time monitoring of Joker malware.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n**Infected Package Name on Google Play Store** **Hash** **Detection**\n**Name**\n\ncom.callphone.spashthemes EFB5D28977819F9C0CA0AC797D798136 Trojan (\n0001140e1\n)\n\ncom.camera.phototimezonecamera DEA4B4BBB25F7474D450B921871FF693 Trojan (\n0001140e1\n)\n\ncom.camerauniquemonitor.heartkeep BCE3E7080721B2615D355C4EE91C07CC Trojan (\n0001140e1\n)\n\ncom.country.landscape.wallpaper 0E5559546C2C01AF8326600C8DD7D7C8 Trojan (\n00580dec1\n)\n\n\n-----\n\ncom.humble.wallpapers E6CC00167761395BEF0FD2800CD66306 Trojan (\n0058134e1\n)\n\ncom.maccode.qrs.app 3E9858CA09CF039C54276529C9A790AE Trojan (\n0058134d1\n)\n\ncom.msc.docscanner DFDFC5A14A1D8C34A6EBF8D882334B2E Trojan (\n0001140e1\n)\n\ncom.mysdkdialy.bpanaysis E1756D7D7905B362B3D6431F61527DE9 Trojan (\n0001140e1\n)\n\ncom.PhotoMessage E1D05485913D4E7BF444A0492015D0DA Trojan (\n0058134b1\n)\n\ncom.smartful.companynowmessages.digitalesms FB584881E0CE6A643B12F5BA660EFC77 Trojan (\n0001140e1\n)\n\ncom.superjiu.camerascanner AE4045B3231217ED61297F1DE6966BAE Trojan (\n0001140e1\n)\n\nqrmatadata.scannerfreeused A5E6D4F943E6B039F2E5099243585778 Trojan (\n005812df1\n)\n\nsticker.mackercreator.wonderful D26ACC188894892F354F0A9DFBC0C163 Trojan (\n0001140e1\n)\n\n### Payload URLs\n\nfenglintechnology-app01[.oss-me-east-1.aliyuncs.com\n\nimplemente[.life\n\ngrouplearn[.shop\n\npuerassist[.club\n\n\n-----",
