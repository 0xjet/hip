    "plain_text": "# VPN Hacks Are a Slow-Motion Disaster\n\n**wired.com/story/vpn-hacks-pulse-secure-espionage/**\n\nBrian Barrett April 25, 2021\n\nThis year has seen no shortage of blockbuster hacks, from the SolarWinds supply chain\nmeltdown to [China’s blitz against Microsoft Exchange servers. It’s a lot. But the outsized](https://www.wired.com/story/china-microsoft-exchange-server-hack-victims/)\nfocus on those hacking sprees obscures another threat that has built steadily in the\nbackground for years, with no clean resolution in sight: the sustained assault on virtual\nprivate networks.\n\nThe latest example of a VPN meltdown—we’re talking corporate connections, not your\npersonal setup—is among the most dramatic. Security firm FireEye this week revealed that it\nhad found a dozen malware families, spread across multiple hacking groups, feasting on\nvulnerabilities in Pulse Secure VPN. The victims spanned the globe and ranged across the\nusual high-value targets: defense contractors, financial institutions, and governments. The\nattackers used their perch to steal legitimate credentials, improving their chances of gaining\naccess that’s both deep and sustained.\n\nWhich is the thing about VPN hacks. Since the whole point of a VPN is to create a secure\nconnection to a network, worming into one can save hackers a lot of hassle. “Once hackers\nhave those credentials, they don’t need to use spearphishing emails, they don’t need to bring\nin custom malware,” says Sarah Jones, senior principal analyst at FireEye. “It’s kind of a\nperfect situation.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe campaign that FireEye uncovered is especially ambitious and potentially troubling. It s\ntoo early for firm attribution, but the groups behind it appear to be linked to China, and their\ntargets seem chock full of the kind of sensitive information on which espionage groups thrive.\nOne of the malware families, called Slowpulse, could get around two-factor authentication\nprotections, sidestepping a key safeguard against credential harvesting.\n\n“The new issue, discovered this month, impacted a very limited number of customers,” said\nPulse Secure parent company Ivanti in a statement. “The team worked quickly to provide\nmitigations directly to the limited number of impacted customers that remediates the risk to\ntheir system.”\n\n“If the haystack keeps increasing, it’s impossible to find the needle.”\n\nVijay Sarvepalli, CERT\n\nA patch to fix the vulnerability at the heart of the attacks, though, won’t be available until next\nmonth. And even then, it may not provide much of a salve. Companies are often slow to\nupdate their VPNs, in part because downtime means employees effectively can’t get their\nwork done. Some of the intrusions FireEye spotted, in fact, appear related to vulnerabilities\nthat had been reported as far back as 2019. That same year, a Pulse Secure VPN flaw\noffered an inroad for a ransomware group to hold up Travelex, a travel insurance company,\n[for millions of dollars. A year later—despite warnings from researchers, national](https://www.wsj.com/articles/major-companies-shared-vulnerability-used-in-travelex-cyberattack-11579177596)\ncybersecurity organizations, and law enforcement—thousands of organizations remained\nvulnerable, says Troy Mursch, chief research officer of the cyber-threat intelligence company\nBad Packets.\n\nIt wasn’t always like this. VPNs used to typically rely on a set of protocols known as Internet\nProtocol Security, or IPsec. While IPsec-based VPNs are considered secure and reliable,\nthey can also be complicated and clunky for users. In recent years, as remote work\nexpanded then exploded, more and more VPNs have been built instead on ubiquitous\nencryption technologies known as secure sockets layer and transport layer security. The\ndistinctions descend rapidly into weeds, but essentially SSL/TLS VPNs made logging onto\nyour company’s network much more seamless—the difference between merging onto the\ninterstate in a minivan versus a Miata.\n\n“That was a big step for convenience,” says Vijay Sarvepalli, a senior security solutions\narchitect with the CERT Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon University. CERT helps\ncatalog vulnerabilities and coordinate their public disclosure. “When they designed those\nthings, the risks were not yet considered. It’s not impossible to protect these, but people are\nnot prepared to monitor and respond quickly to attacks against them.”\n\nSoftware of all stripes have vulnerabilities, but because VPNs by definition act as a conduit\nfor information that’s intended to be private, their bugs have serious implications. The\npandemic's shift to remote work has thrust the underlying issues into the spotlight. “Many\n\n\n-----\n\nSSL VPN vendors had serious flaws in their products to begin with, says Mursch. The\nincreased usage of SSL VPNs over the last year led to more scrutiny from security\nresearchers—and threat actors interested in exploiting them.”\n\nMore flaws means more opportunities for attackers. More users on a given VPN also makes\nit that much more difficult to spot the bad guys, especially for large, multinational companies.\n“It makes it harder to monitor when you have a lot more events going on,” says Sarvepalli. “If\nthe haystack keeps increasing, it’s impossible to find the needle.”\n\nTo the extent that there’s a silver lining here, it’s that the hackers behind the latest set of\nPulse Secure-related intrusions are incredibly sophisticated. OK, yes, that’s also bad news,\nin that they’ve likely stolen sensitive data from who knows how many corners of the world.\nBut it also means that copycats are unlikely to be able to replicate their moves before the\nvulnerability gets patched, at least not without a lot of work.\n\n“It’s rather specific in the knowledge you need to exploit it,” say Stephen Eckels, a reverse\nengineer at FireEye. “For us to understand what their malware was doing, we had to be in\ncontact with the authors of the code from Pulse Secure. An attacker was able to figure out\nthat same information on their own. ”\n\nStill, VPN vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit persist. Hackers will eventually reverse\nengineer this one after the patch comes out. And corporations continue not to address the\nexposure to their networks, despite frantic warnings from the security community. That status\nquo adds up to months or years of quiet espionage, the kind that may never lend itself to a\nfull accounting. “There’s a lot to be done still,” says Sarvepalli of the work required to shore\nup VPNs. “We are making progress, and some of these big hammers wake us up.”\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: [Get our newsletters!](https://www.wired.com/newsletter?sourceCode=BottomStories)\n[The cold war over McDonald's hacked ice cream machines](https://www.wired.com/story/they-hacked-mcdonalds-ice-cream-makers-started-cold-war/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_1&itm_content=footer-recirc)\n[What octopus dreams tell us about the evolution of sleep](https://www.wired.com/story/what-octopus-dreams-tell-us-about-the-evolution-of-sleep/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_1&itm_content=footer-recirc)\nThe lazy gamer’s [guide to cable management](https://www.wired.com/story/lazy-gamers-guide-cable-management/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_1&itm_content=footer-recirc)\n[How to log in to your devices without passwords](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-log-in-without-passwords-touchid-face-unlock-windows-hello/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_1&itm_content=footer-recirc)\nHelp!
