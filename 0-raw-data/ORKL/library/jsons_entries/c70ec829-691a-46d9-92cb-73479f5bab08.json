    "plain_text": "# Foreign Actors Likely to Use Online Journals to Spread Disinformation Regarding 2020 Elections\n\n**ic3.gov/media/2020/201001.aspx**\n\n## October 01, 2020 (2020-10-01T09:30:00-04:00)\n\nAlert Number\n\n## I-100120-PSA\n\nQuestions regarding this PSA should be directed to your local FBI Field Office.\n\nLocal Field Office Locations: [www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/Egress?url=https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices)\n\n_The FBI and CISA are issuing this PSA as a part of a series on threats to the 2020 election_\n_to enable the American public to be prepared, patient, and participating voters._\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security\nAgency (CISA) are issuing this announcement to raise awareness of the potential threat\nposed by foreign-backed online journals that spread disinformation regarding the 2020\nelections. Foreign intelligence services have been known to use websites, including pseudoacademic online journals, to disseminate articles with misleading or unsubstantiated\ninformation. Such sites could be employed during the 2020 election season in an attempt to\nmanipulate public opinion, increase societal divisions, cause widespread confusion, discredit\nthe electoral process, and undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions.\n\nForeign intelligence services have used online journals, including some with a global reach,\nto exacerbate disunity and dysfunction in the United States while also misinforming or\nmisleading readers. Foreign governments have used these journals to amplify their\ndisinformation and overt propaganda, and they have used websites, social media, and other\nonline platforms to amplify the journals' messages and increase their global reach.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs foreign actors intensify their efforts to influence the outcome of the 2020 U.S. elections,\nthey could use online journals to advance and launder misinformation and disinformation to\ndenigrate or support specific candidates or political parties. Foreign actors could also use\nonline journals to target the U.S. elections by making claims of voter suppression, amplifying\nreports of real or alleged cyberattacks on election infrastructure, asserting voter or ballot\nfraud, and spreading other information intended to convince the public of the elections'\nillegitimacy.\n\nRecommendations\n\nSeek out information from trustworthy sources, verify who produced the content, and\nconsider their intent.\nRely on state and local election officials as the authoritative sources of information\nabout how elections are conducted in their jurisdictions.\nVerify through multiple reliable sources any reports about problems in voting or election\nresults, and consider searching for other reliable sources before sharing such\ninformation via social media or other avenues.\nReport potential election crimes—such as disinformation about the manner, time, or\nplace of voting—to the FBI.\nIf appropriate, make use of in-platform tools offered by social media companies for\nreporting suspicious posts that appear to be spreading false or inconsistent information\nabout election-related problems or results.\n\nThe FBI and CISA urge the American public to critically evaluate the sources of the\ninformation they consume and to seek out reliable and verified information. The FBI is\nresponsible for investigating malign foreign influence operations and malicious cyber activity\ntargeting election infrastructure and other U.S. democratic institutions. CISA is responsible\nfor protecting the nation's critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats. The FBI and\nCISA provide services and information to uphold the security, integrity, and resiliency of the\nU.S. electoral processes.\n\nVictim Reporting and Additional Information\n\nThe FBI encourages the public to report information concerning suspicious or criminal\n[activity to their local field office (www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices) or to the FBI's Internet](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/Egress?url=https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices)\n[Crime Complaint Center (www.ic3.gov).
