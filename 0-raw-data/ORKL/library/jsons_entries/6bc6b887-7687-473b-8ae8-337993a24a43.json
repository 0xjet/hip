Today, business\n\nand government policy alike are difficult to imagine without informa\ntion technologies. But criminals have learned to use these systems\n\nfor unlawful purposes. The result is a constant battle between cyber\noutlaws and security professionals. To survive, criminals constantly\n\nrefine their methods and tools, leaving greater numbers of digital\n\nthreats in their wake.\n\nBy cyberthreat, we refer to a confluence of factors and conditions\n\nwith the potential to compromise information security. In this report,\n\nwe will consider cyberthreats from the standpoint of the actions per\nformed by criminals in cyberspace with the intention to breach an\n\ninformation system for stealing data or money, or performing other\n\nacts with the potential to cause harm to governments, businesses, or\n\nindividuals. Criminals may pursue these aims by targeting corporate\n\nIT infrastructure, workstations, mobile devices, other software and\n\nequipment, or humans themselves.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Trends and forecasts\n\nPositive Technologies keeps monitoring the most important IT se\ncurity threats. Cybercriminals are not slackening: they seize on news\n\nof fresh vulnerabilities, react to cryptocurrency price changes, and\n\ncontinue to refine their techniques.\n\nSummarizing our findings from the second quarter of 2019, we\n\nnote the following trends:\n\n� The number of unique cyberincidents remains high, standing at\n\nthree percent higher than in Q1 2019.\n\n� Mass attacks are less common than targeted ones, which make\n\nup 59 percent of the total (12% higher than in Q1).\n\n� Over half of all cybercrimes have data theft as their goal. Direct\n\nfinancial gain motivated 42 percent of attacks on individuals and\n\n30 percent of attacks on organizations.\n\n� In attacks on organizations, most stolen information consisted of\n\npersonal data (29%). Individuals stood to lose their credentials\n\nand payment card information (44% and 34%, respectively, of all\n\ninformation stolen from individuals).\n\n� Growth in the value of Bitcoin has inspired a revival of hidden\n\nmining.\n\n� MageCart attacks are becoming more common. Experts have\n\nnoted the increased presence of JS sniffers even on sites that do\n\nnot handle payments.\n\n� Malware infections have become more common among govern\nment targets (62% compared to 44% in Q1 2019). Last quarter,\n\ngovernments most frequently were hit by ransomware.\n\n� [IT companies often serve as a stepping-stone in supply chain at-](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/supply-chain-malware)\n\n[tacks. Email addresses from hacked IT vendors are actively used](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/supply-chain-malware)\n\nby attackers in phishing messages.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Statistics\n\nAs in past quarters, data theft is the top goal of most cyberattacks. Direct financial gain, by contrast, is\n\nsought in 30 percent of attacks on organizations and in 42 percent of attacks on individuals. The high\n\nrate of financially motivated attacks on individuals owes to several factors: regular mass infections by\n\nadware (including on mobile devices), infection by miners and other malware on dubious sites, and ex\ntortion campaigns in which the victim is threatened with compromising information.\n\n10% 2% 58% 42% 3% 55%\n\nAccess to information\n\nin attacks on in attacks on Financial profit\norganizations individuals\n\nHacktivism\n\nCyberwar\n\n30%\n\nFigure 1. Attackers' motives\n\nPersonal data and credentials are the most frequent item of interest for attackers targeting organizations.\n\nThis is no surprise, since companies can keep huge databases of clients' personal data and credentials. In\n\naddition, attackers may be interested in the credentials of the employees of the victim company.\n\nSocial media accounts can also be of value to an attacker, especially if an account is highly popular with a\n\nlarge number of subscribers. At the same time, users often fail to take basic precautions for securing their\n\naccounts. They use weak passwords or re-use passwords across sites, enter their passwords without mak\ning sure of site authenticity, and give out information that could help to guess their password. These factors\n\nexplain the high rate of stolen credentials (44%) among attacks on individuals. For instance, computer\n\n[game fans form a high-risk category. In Q2, attackers lured Steam users to websites with the false promise](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/social-engineering/2019/06/fresh-video-games-site-welcomes-new-users-with-steam-phish/)\n\nof a free new game, as long as the users would enter their Steam credentials first. Similar ruses can also be\n\n[found on gaming forums. A number of websites distributed the TurtleCoin cryptocurrency mining Trojan,](https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=13315&lng=en&c=5)\n\nwhich was disguised as a ZIP file supposedly containing cheat codes.\n\nSince payment cards and financial details are usually protected cryptographically, attackers' method of\n\nleast resistance is to trick people into disclosing this information via social engineering. Among attacks\n\non individuals, 34 percent of stolen data consists of payment card information.\n\n\n7% 6% 2% 4% 29%\n\n\n9% 7% 6% 44%\n\n\nin attacks on in attacks on\norganizations individuals\n\n\nPersonal data\n\nCredentials\n\nPayment card information\n\nCorporate secrets\n\nMedical records\n\nClient databases\n\nPersonal correspondence\n\nOther\n\n\n12% 13% 27%\n\n\n34%\n\nFigure 2.

The share of\n\ncyberincidents targeting individuals\n\nwas 24 percent. Among organiza\ntions (see Figure 3), the most fre\nquent targets were governments,\n\nindustrial companies, healthcare in\nstitutions, banks, and other financial\n\nentities.

For example, the DanaBot modular Trojan\n\n[we wrote about in Q1 now has ransomware capabilities. By comparison, another well-known piece of](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/cybersecurity-threatscape-2019-q1/)\n\n[ransomware, GandCrab, wound down and its operators announced the end of the malicious campaign.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/gandcrab-ransomware-operation-says-its-shutting-down/)\n\nSeveral weeks after reports indicated the end of development of the ransomware, security researchers\n\n[disclosed they had obtained access to the GandCrab servers. With the help of the encryption keys](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/release-of-gandcrab-52-decryptor-ends-a-bad-ransomware-story/)\n\nstored there, it was possible to make a decryption program for the latest version of GandCrab so that\n\nvictims could recover their encrypted files.\n\nDespite these events, the rate of ransomware attacks remains high. Creating a simple strain of ransom\nware does not even require custom code development. Most new ransomware is very similar to what al\nready exists. Instead of developing code from scratch, cybercriminals can now just acquire ready-to-use\n\ncode or pay for a subscription (ransomware as a service) on the darkweb. So even with minimal upfront\n\ninvestment, ransomware can bring a sizable income.\n\n[Reports have periodically appeared since April 2019 of attacks by new Sodinokibi ransomware. At least](https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/attackers-exploit-msps-tools-to-distribute-ransomware/d/d-id/1335025)\n\nthree IT service providers have fallen victim to it. Cybercriminals have used remote administration tools\n\n(Webroot and Kaseya) to install ransomware on the systems of clients of the compromised IT service\n\nproviders. But Sodinokibi has a few other tricks up its sleeve, in addition to supply chain attacks. It also\n\n[is spread via vulnerabilities in Oracle WebLogic Server and in phishing messages.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sodinokibi-ransomware-being-installed-on-exploited-weblogic-servers/)\n\n\n7% 5% 4% 7% 32%\n\n\n10% 7% 5% 5% 20%\n\n\nin attacks on in attacks on\norganizations individuals\n\n\nSpyware\n\nAdware\n\nMultifunctional malware\n\nRATs\n\nRansomware\n\nMiners\n\nBanking Trojans\n\nDroppers\n\nOther\n\n\n9% 9% 27%\n\n\n12% 12% 12% 17%\n\nFigure 8. Types of malware\n\n\nEmail continues to be the most popular method for delivering malware. In Q2, experts noticed an uptick\n\n[in cases of Trojans being spread in the ISO disk image format. This trick has been used by AgentTesla,](https://myonlinesecurity.co.uk/more-agenttesla-keylogger-and-nanocore-rat-in-one-bundle/)\n\n[LokiBot, and NanoCore. ISO images are often not scanned by antivirus software, since they may be](https://www.netskope.com/blog/lokibot-nanocore-iso-disk-image-files)\n\nwhitelisted. One giveaway is the file size: a malicious disk image will be smaller than 2 megabytes, while\n\na legitimate one will usually be much larger.\n\n\n-----\n\n1% 4% 48%\n\n\n7% 29%\n\n\n1%\n\n7%\n\n39%\n\n\n15%\n\nin attacks on in attacks on\norganizations individuals\n\n24%\n\n\nEmail\n\nCompromised servers\nand workstations\n\nWebsites\n\nOfficial app stores\n\nChat and SMS messages\n\nOther\n\n\n25%\n\nFigure 9. Malware distribution methods\n\nWe saw renewed criminal interest in cryptojacking in Q2 2019. With the Bitcoin price rising steadily, at\n[tackers continue to develop software for stealthy mining. Researchers at Sucuri discovered a miner with](https://blog.sucuri.net/2019/06/cryptomining-dropper-and-cronjob-creator.html)\n\nimproved persistence mechanisms: a special cron job (which is run periodically according to a schedule)\n\nallows resuming mining even if the main malware module has been detected and removed from the\n\ninfected system.\n\nAttackers widely distributed the AZORult infostealer in the second quarter. For instance, the experts at\n\nthe Positive Technologies Expert Security Center (PT ESC) in early April noted that the RTM group had\n\nstarted using AZORult instead of Pony. In addition, the AZORult Trojan spreads via websites under the\n\n[guise of various utilities (such as the G-Cleaner system optimizer or Pirate Chick VPN client).](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-windows-pc-cleaner-drops-azorult-info-stealing-trojan/)\n\n##### Social engineering\n\n[In Q2, criminals made active use of Azure App Service for different types of fraud involving social en-](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/app-service/)\n\ngineering. Azure can be used for quickly deploying phishing pages with fake login forms, as well as for\n\ncreating fake Microsoft technical support pages with popups stating the visitor's computer has been\n\ninfected by a non-existent virus. In addition, attackers send emails prompting to download a file after\n\nlogging in via a fake form, which is hosted on Azure Blob Storage. The scale and success of this scam is\n\ncaused in part by the domain (windows.net) and valid SSL certificate (belonging to Microsoft). But such\n\n[scams are hardly new. Instructions are available to users with the details of how to automatically block](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/office-365-custom-rules-to-block-azure-blob-storage-phishing-attacks/)\n\nsuch phishing emails.\n\nFigure 10. Theft of Office 365 credentials with use of Azure Blob Storage\n\n\n-----\n\nAs noted already, the strong increase in Bitcoin value in Q2 sparked a return of interest in the cryptocur\nrency, including among the criminal community. In one iteration, fraudsters used a seemingly timeless\n\nscheme. They claimed to be famous people or organizations offering cash prizes, with a catch: the \"win\nner\" must first transfer a small amount of money for verification purposes. In this case, the cryptocurren\n[cy \"prizes\" were supposedly being handed out by John McAfee and Elon Musk.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beware-of-fake-john-mcafee-and-tesla-cryptocurrency-giveaways/)\n\nYouTube's popularity has made video channels an attractive place to put malicious links. In one fraud\n\n[campaign, viewers were shown links (in the video description) to materials allegedly teaching how to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/youtube-cryptocurrency-videos-pushing-info-stealing-trojan/)\n\ngenerate bitcoins for free. But in reality, clicking the link initiated download of the Qulab infostealer.\n\n[Another such campaign used YouTube to spread the njRAT Trojan.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/youtube-bitcoin-scams-pushing-the-njrat-backdoor-infostealer/)\n\n##### Hacking\n\n[The most discussed security issue of Q2 was BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708), a critical](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0708)\n\nRemote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the RDS service in older versions of Windows.\n\nAlthough Microsoft released a patch on May 14, many computers around the world remain at\n\n[risk. Attackers are actively probing for vulnerable hosts and developing exploits.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/intense-scanning-activity-detected-for-bluekeep-rdp-flaw/)\n\n**BlueKeep could be exploited to spread malware on the scale of WannaCry,**\n\n**[which is why installing Windows updates is so important](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0708)**\n\n[Hackers are making use of a vulnerability in the Exim mail server (CVE-2019-10149) to remotely run OS](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-10149)\n\n[commands with administrator privileges.

In addition, criminals illegally install cryptocurrency miners on vulnerable servers. The vulnerabili-](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/new-pervasive-worm-exploiting-linux-exim-server-vulnerability)\n\nty was fixed by the Exim developers in February 2019. But release of a vendor update often fails to solve\n\nthe problem outright. Delays in installing updates give hackers a chance to successfully exploit even\n\nvulnerabilities that are five years old.\n\nThroughout Q2, attackers searched for publicly available Docker API instances by scanning the Internet\n\nfor hosts with open port 2375. Misconfigured Docker containers are used for a wide array of purposes.\n\n[After discovering a working container, for example, hackers might install Dofloo on it. This is the same](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/aesddos-botnet-malware-infiltrates-containers-via-exposed-docker-apis/)\n\n[Trojan placed by attackers on systems running Atlassian Confluence.

Dofloo uses the victim's resources to perform DDoS attacks and hidden cryptocurren-](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-3396)\n\ncy mining.\n\n##### Web attacks\n\nIn Q2, web vulnerabilities were exploited in 18 percent of attacks on organizations. The wave since Q1\n\nof attacks on payment sites continues to build. MageCart attacks with JS sniffers (malicious scripts de\n[signed to steal payment card information) hit Forbes, Puma, and numerous online stores. The criminals](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-inject-magecart-card-skimmer-in-forbes-subscription-site/)\n\nregularly update their malicious scripts. The danger of JS sniffers is that the threat may stay unnoticed\n\n[by users, since the malicious scripts are invisible to them. But one of the new methods used by MageCart](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2019/05/skimmer-acts-as-payment-service-provider-via-rogue-iframe/)\n\nto steal data may offer a way for attentive users to spot the threat. The attackers inject a form for enter\ning card information into site pages. But normally this interface should be shown only after the user is\n\nredirected to the secure page of the payment provider. Entering card information twice (first on the site\n\nitself and a second time on the payment provider's page) should raise red flags among users.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 11. MageCart form for stealing payment card information](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2019/05/skimmer-acts-as-payment-service-provider-via-rogue-iframe/)\n\n[In Q2, Malwarebytes Labs discovered MageCart JS sniffers in libraries stored by site developers in private](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2019/06/magecart-skimmers-found-on-amazon-cloudfront-cdn/)\n\n[Amazon CloudFront CDN repositories. In addition, since April criminals have been injecting MageCart](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/magecart-amazon-s3-buckets/)\n\nsniffers into files on Amazon S3, leading to compromise of 17,000 sites. Since not all compromised sites\n\nshow a form for entering card information, experts gauge it likely that the hackers are using JS sniffers\n\nfor so-called mass spray and pray attacks.\n\nNot all of the sites targeted are used for online purchases. In June, the Social Engineered blog, devel\n[oped on MyBB, was hacked. Attackers took advantage of an XSS vulnerability in MyBB that had become](https://cyware.com/news/social-engineered-site-falls-prey-to-an-xss-vulnerability-leaks-over-85000-unique-email-addresses-12d49f57)\n\npublic several days prior. The attackers thus were able to obtain 55,000 sets of credentials and personal\n\nmessages of forum users.\n\n##### Credential compromise\n\n[Weak passwords remain a major security threat. Passwords for 300 employees of Ethiopia's Information](https://www.safetydetective.com/blog/report-ethiopia-insa-leak/)\n\n[Network Security Agency, charged with overseeing information security, proved to be weak and were](https://www.safetydetective.com/blog/report-ethiopia-insa-leak/)\n\nsubsequently hacked and posted online. Out of 300 passwords, 142 were \"p@$$w0rd\" and another 60\n\nwere \"123\".\n\nCredential stuffing (attempts to log in to a system using sets of credentials stolen elsewhere) remains\n\n[frequent. Such attacks resulted in the breach of around half a million user accounts for the Uniqlo and](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/over-460-million-eretailer-1/)\n\nGU online stores.\n\n[Q2 also marked attacks by the new GoldBrute botnet to bruteforce RDP passwords. Over 1.5 million](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-goldbrute-botnet-is-trying-to-hack-15-million-rdp-servers/)\n\nWindows devices have already been attacked. While the objectives of the attackers remain unclear,\n\nthey likely include selling the stolen credentials on the darkweb. Mass attacks on weak credentials are a\n\ncommon occurrence for IoT devices as well. Silex malware, which attempts to log in to IoT devices using\n\n[standard sets of credentials, made the news in June.

In the U.S. in early May, the entire IT infrastruc\n[ture of Baltimore was inoperative for several weeks due to RobinHood ransomware. City authorities](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/25/us/nsa-hacking-tool-baltimore.html)\n\n[estimated losses at over $18 million.

This is particularly the case in small cities with poor\nly developed IT infrastructure. The city council of Riviera Beach, Florida, unanimously voted to pay a\n\n[ransom of 65 bitcoins (approximately $600,000) since the city lacked the backups necessary to get its](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/riviera-beach-florida-ransomware-attack-city-council-pays-600000-to-hackers-who-seized-its-computer-system/)\n\nsystems running again.\n\nAnother Florida city, Lake City, was targeted by ransomware in early June. City information systems were\n\n[infected as part of the large Triple Threat malicious campaign first described in April by Cybereason.](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/lake-city-reveals-it-suffered-a-triple-threat-ransomware-attack/)\n\nThe Triple Threat campaign received its name because of its three-part payload: phishing messages\n\ndelivered three different Trojans (Emotet, TrickBot, and Ryuk) to victim computers. Although infected\n\ndevices were disconnected from the city network as soon as possible, this was not fast enough to save\n\nmost phone and mail systems. Lake City decided to meet the attackers' demand of 42 bitcoins (approx\n[imately $530,000), after which the city's IT director was fired.](https://www.wcjb.com/content/news/City-of-Lake-City-moves-Forward-after-Cyber-Attack-511802711.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nYet another Florida city, Key Biscayne, came in the sights of ransomware attackers in late June. But in\n\n[this case the city refused to pay up.](https://miami.cbslocal.com/2019/06/26/key-biscayne-third-city-data-breach-florida-cities-paid-hackers/)\n\nGovernments have suffered due to phishing as well. In one such attack in Canada, the city of Burlington\n\n[lost $503,000.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/city-of-burlington-falls-for-503-000-phishing-scheme-1.5174695)\n\n[Government-related websites continue to attract ill-wishers.

Data stolen\n\n\nCredentials\n\nCorporate secrets\n\n\nAlmost all Q2 2019 attacks on industrial companies (96%) involved use of malware. The RTM group is\n\nactively attempting to penetrate the internal IT infrastructure of industrial companies. PT ESC detected\n\n26 malicious mailings by the group during the second quarter. Recipients included financial institutions\n\nand over a dozen industrial entities in Russia and the CIS. All the messages were written in Russian and\n\ntend to have a financial focus, claiming to include invoices, accounting paperwork, or related documents,\n\nrequesting to verify the documents, sign them, or make payment.\n\nThe RTM Trojan is classified as spyware: it steals credentials, records video, takes screenshots, and exfil\ntrates them to the attackers' server. Of interest, in June the group changed the method for getting the\n\nIP address of its command-and-control (C2) server. Now the address is obtained with the help of logic\n\noperations (AND and a right rotation) on the amount of a transaction received by a certain Bitcoin wallet.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Ransomware continues its assault on industry. Two such victims in Q2 included Aebi Schmidt, manufac-](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/23/aebi-schmidt-ransomware/)\n\n[turer of equipment for airports, and ASCO, a major aviation parts supplier.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-halts-production-for-days-at-major-airplane-parts-manufacturer/)\n\n[Hackers frequently target the websites of industrial companies.

In this case, too, the motivation for\n\nthe theft included gift card fraud.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### What companies can do to stay safe\n\n###### Use proven security solutions\n\n� Implement a system for centralized management of updates and patch\nes. To prioritize update plans correctly, the most pressing security threats\n\nmust be taken into account.\n\n� Install antivirus software with a sandbox for dynamically scanning files\n\nand the ability to detect and block threats such as malicious email at\ntachments before they are opened by employees. Ideally, antivirus soft\nware should simultaneously support solutions from multiple vendors and\n\nhave the ability to detect signs of hidden or obfuscated malware, as well\n\nas block malicious activity across diverse data streams: email, web traf\nfic, network traffic, file storage, and web portals. The solution must not\n\nonly check files in real time, but also automatically analyze files that have\n\nalready been checked; this will allow detecting new threats when signa\nture databases are updated.\n\n� We also recommend using SIEM solutions for timely detection and ef\nfective response to information security incidents. This will help identi\nfy suspicious activity, prevent infrastructure hacking, detect attackers'\n\npresence, and enable prompt measures to neutralize threats.\n\n� Use automated software audit tools to identify vulnerabilities.\n\n� Use web application firewalls as a preventive measure to protect websites.\n\n� Implement systems allowing deep network traffic analysis in order to\n\ndetect advanced persistent threats in real time and in saved traffic. Using\n\nsuch solutions will allow you to detect previously unnoticed attacks and\n\nmonitor network attacks in real time, including use of malware and hack\ning tools, exploitation of software vulnerabilities, and attacks on the do\nmain controller. Such an approach quickly identifies attackers' presence\n\nin the infrastructure, minimizes the risk of loss of critical data and disrup\ntion to business systems, and decreases the financial damage caused by\n\nthe attackers.\n\n� Employ specialized anti-DDoS services.\n\n###### Protect your data\n\n� Encrypt all sensitive information. Do not store sensitive information\n\nwhere it can be publicly accessed.\n\n� Perform regular backups and keep them on dedicated servers that are\n\nisolated from the network segments used for day-to-day operations.\n\n� Minimize the privileges of users and services as much as possible.\n\n� Do not use identical username–password combinations for multiple\n\nsystems.\n\n� Use two-factor authentication where possible, especially for privileged\n\naccounts.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Do not allow weak passwords\n\n� Enforce a password policy with strict length and complexity requirements.\n\n� Require password changes every 90 days.\n\n� Replace all default passwords with stronger ones that are unique.\n\n###### Monitor and stay current\n\n� Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches.\n\n� Test and educate employees regarding information security.\n\n� Make sure that insecure resources do not appear on the network perimeter. Regularly\n\ntake an inventory of Internet-accessible resources, check their security, and remediate\n\nany vulnerabilities found. It is a good idea to monitor the news for any new vulnerabil\nities: this gives a head start in identifying affected resources and applying necessary\n\npatches.\n\n� Filter traffic to minimize the number of network service interfaces accessible to an ex\nternal attacker. Pay special attention to interfaces for remote management of servers\n\nand network equipment.\n\n� Regularly perform penetration testing to identify new vectors for attacking internal\n\ninfrastructure and evaluate the effectiveness of current measures.\n\n� Regularly audit the security of web applications, including source-code analysis, to\n\nidentify and eliminate vulnerabilities that put application systems and clients at risk\n\nof attack.\n\n� Keep an eye on the number of requests per second received by resources. Configure\n\nservers and network devices to withstand typical attack scenarios (such as TCP/UDP\n\nflooding or high numbers of database requests).\n\n###### Keep clients in mind\n\n� Improve security awareness among clients.\n\n� Regularly remind clients how to stay safe online from the most common attacks.\n\n� Urge clients to not enter their credentials on suspicious websites and to not give out\n\nsuch information by email or over the phone.\n\n� Explain what clients should do if they suspect fraud.\n\n� Inform of security-related events.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### How vendors can secure their products\n\n� Follow all of the recommendations given in the section on corporate security.\n\n� Implement a secure development lifecycle (SSDL).\n\n� Regularly audit the security of software and web applications,\n\nincluding source-code analysis.\n\n� Keep web servers and database software up to date.\n\n� Do not use libraries or frameworks with known vulnerabilities.\n\n#### How users can avoid falling victim\n\n###### Invest in security:\n\n� Use only licensed software.\n\n� Maintain effective antivirus protection on all devices.\n\n� Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches.\n\n###### Protect your data:\n\n� Back up critical files. In addition to storing them on your hard drive, keep a copy\n\non a USB drive, external disk, or a backup service in the cloud.\n\n� Use an account without administrator privileges for everyday tasks.\n\n� Use two-factor authentication where possible, such as for email accounts.\n\n###### Do not use weak passwords:\n\n� Use complex passwords consisting of at least eight hard-to-guess letters, num\nbers, and special characters. Consider using a password manager to create and\n\nsecurely store passwords.\n\n� Set a different password for each site, email address, or other account that you use.\n\n� Change all passwords at least once every six months, or even better, every two to\n\nthree months.\n\n###### Be vigilant:\n\n� Scan all email attachments with antivirus software.\n\n� Be careful when visiting sites with invalid certificates. Remember that information\n\nentered on these sites could be intercepted by attackers.\n\n� Pay close attention when entering passwords or making payments online.\n\n� Do not click links to unknown suspicious sites, especially if a security warning appears.\n\n� Do not click links in pop-up windows, even if you know the company or product\n\nbeing advertised.\n\n� Do not download files from suspicious sites or unknown sources.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### About the research\n\nIn this quarter's report, Positive Technologies shares information on the\n\nmost important and emerging IT security threats. Information is drawn\n\nfrom our own expertise, outcomes of numerous investigations, and data\n\nfrom authoritative sources.\n\nAny particular mass incident, such as a phishing campaign using malware,\n\nis considered in this report as a single unique information security threat.\n\nEach event is characterized by the following parameters:\n\n� Attack target is the target of destructive actions by cybercriminals. In\n\ncases when social engineering is used to obtain information directly\n\nfrom an individual, client, or employee, the attack target is \"Humans\" On\n\nthe other hand, when social engineering is part of an attempt to place\n\nmalware on corporate infrastructure or on the computer of an individ\nual, the attack target is \"Computers, servers, and network equipment.\"\n\n� Attack motive is the ultimate goal of cybercriminals. If an attack results\n\nin theft of payment card information, the motive is \"data theft.\"\n\n� Attack methods are a set of techniques used to achieve a goal. An at\ntacker can perform reconnaissance, detect vulnerable network services\n\navailable for connection, exploit vulnerabilities, and get access to re\nsources or information. For the purposes of this report, this process is\n\nreferred to as \"hacking.\" Credential compromise and web attacks are\n\nput in separate categories for greater granularity.\n\n� Victim categories are the economic sectors in which the attacked\n\ncompanies operate (or individuals, if the attack was indiscriminate). For\n\nexample, the \"Hospitality and entertainment\" category includes com\npanies providing paid services, such as consulting agencies, hotels, and\n\nrestaurants. The \"Online services\" category includes platforms where\n\nusers can fulfill their needs online, for example ticket and hotel aggrega\ntor websites, blogs, social networks, chat platforms and other social me\ndia resources, video sharing platforms, and online games. Large-scale\n\ncyberattacks affecting more than one industry (most often, malware\n\noutbreaks) have been placed in the \"Multiple industries\" category.\n\nWe believe that in most cases cyberattacks are not made public because\n\nof reputational risks, which makes it hard even for companies involved in\n\nincident investigation and analysis of hacking groups to calculate the pre\ncise number of threats. This research is conducted in order to draw the\n\nattention of companies and ordinary individuals who care about the state\n\nof information security to the key motives and methods of cyberattacks, as\n\nwell as to highlight the main trends in the changing cyberthreat landscape.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout\nPositive Technologies\n\n\nPositive Technologies is a leading global provider of enterprise security solutions for vulnerability and compliance management, incident\nand threat analysis, and application protection.
