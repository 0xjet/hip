Some are even advertised on landing pages of popular Dark Web sites, which\ntransports users to the luring page of Bitcoin SCAMS. Inexperienced or Less Tech-Savvy\nNetizens are stupefied by such posts, falling into the bait; ultimately losing money.\n\nIt is also evident that these kinds of scams are being made operational by infamous\nThreat Actors such as Dark Hotel (Korea) to gain maximized profit to fund their Cyber\nOperations. One such incident pertaining to Magniber Ransomware (which we would be\ndiscussing at the end of this article). Hence, this paved the way for a passive income for\nthe cyber criminals without directly infecting the intended targets.\n\n\n-----\n\nBitcoin — The Greatest Cryptocurrency is currently witnessing an important stage in its Bull\nRun, surpassing the Market Value of Facebook (2 days back), to become $760 Billion in its\nMarket Value. Moreover, the currency had been legalized in various countries such as the\n**United States, Australia, Japan, Germany, and South Korea. It is also notable that more**\ncountries are in the pipeline of adopting Bitcoin for Economic Stability. Latin American Countries\nlike Venezuela (Boliver) & Argentina (Peso) had already started to migrate towards CryptoEconomy, where local currency is getting devalued and spiraling down to hyperinflation.\n\nAs the adoption rate has gone astronomical, many more concepts are being added to the\nCrypto Economic Cultures such as Bitcoin ATMs, KYC-less Exchanges, Paper Wallet, Cold\nWallets etc.\n\n\n-----\n\n[This provides a detailed view of Bitcoin ATMs installed over the world.](https://coinatmradar.com/countries/)\n\nIt is also remarkable that Bitcoin forks such as BCH (Bitcoin Cash) are also widely being\naccepted for day-to-day trading.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs adoption rate gets quadrupled, the SCAMS in this arena is also getting matured; hence\ndefrauding many Bitcoin Enthusiasts. This article explains about 1 such SCAM which are\ngenerally known as Bitcoin Doubling or\n\nWhat makes these SCAMS successful are various technical pointers which are implemented in\nthe site to entice the people with partial knowledge and low-maintenance web pages etc. Let’s\nlook into one of the use-case!\n\n**CASE STUDY — REAL TIME**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is one of the common Introductions found on such Scams, that instructs the users to feed\ntheir Bitcoin Wallet Address and Required Amount by sliding the Amount Pointer to get it\ninto your account.\n\nThere are various factors used in the Website to lure the visitors. Some of them are:\n**Live Stats:- This is used as a Trust Factor for newbies. The records are probably pulled from**\nthe Live Blockchain Transaction Log, repurposing it as Live Stats to showcase the website\nactivity.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Live Chat Support:- Bragging about the profit made from the site is being dumped in this**\nsection. Another bait awaiting inexperienced users.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to bust this myth, let’s take a chat conversation and run a plain check:\n**“I thought my friend wanted to fool me with this website link. but you can only get BTC**\n**here if you don't mess up with the fee confirmations”**\n\n\n-----\n\nHere, you can see similar Bitcoin Sites where the same chat log was found.\n\n_: The best part is- Chat Windows even works without Internet Connection (as my power got_\n_disrupted while drafting this), hence proving it to be hard-coded to the website (JS Files)._\n\n**Receipts: These are tiny pop-ups that appear on the site alerting visitors about its high-activity,**\nclaiming to have received funds by various users.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Again, if you are running any of the username checks, you will be thrown many SCAM sites._\n\nAfter feeding a BTC Address, it will run a loader to satisfy the eagerness of the visitors.\nFollowing Script is being shown:\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n```\n{ X00Percent: 2, X00Text: Starting injection process... }, { X00Percent: 4,\nX00Text: 'Connecting and Validating vulnerable BCH node...' }, { X00Percent: 8,\nX00Text: 'Spoofing Packets through IPV6 Tunnel...' }, { X00Percent: 10, X00Text:\n'Tunnelling via be6e:854229af:c9a::34' }, { X00Percent: 12, X00Text: 'Connecting to\nNode Maintenance Channel...' }, { X00Percent: 14, X00Text: 'Establishing connection...'\n}, { X00Percent: 16, X00Text: 'Connection successful on port 87118' }, { X00Percent:\n18, X00Text: 'Connecting to Node Maintenance Channel...' }, { X00Percent: 18, X00Text:\n'Re-spoofing Packets through IPV6 Tunnel...' }, { X00Percent: 32, X00Text: 'Extracting\ndata bitcoin pools -2 ' }, { X00Percent: 33, X00Text: 'Exploit uploaded... 0%' }, {\nX00Percent: 38, X00Text: 'Exploit uploaded... 50%' }, { X00Percent: 42, X00Text:\n'Exploit uploaded... 100%' }, { X00Percent: 59, X00Text: 'Success: Spoofing Packets\nthrough IPV6 Tunnel.' }, { X00Percent: 60, X00Text: 'Injecting script...' }, {\nX00Percent: 74, X00Text: 'Checking bitcoin pools response...' }, { X00Percent: 74,\nX00Text: 'Checking BCH Nodes for Vulnerability (OK).' }, { X00Percent: 74, X00Text:\n'79.83.83.61...' }, { X00Percent: 77, X00Text: 'Injecting ....' }, { X00Percent: 79,\nX00Text: 'Spoof Successful(OK)' }, { X00Percent: 79, X00Text: 'Checking Again for BCH\nNodes with Vulnerability (OK).' }, { X00Percent: 82, X00Text: 'Vulnerable Node Found at\n183.9.25.156' }, { X00Percent: 82, X00Text: 'Reading Blockchain Head...!' }, {\nX00Percent: 84, X00Text: 'ea0d7613 f665ce14 4de1a1d5 668088c9 90eadb87\\n dda97e16\n5c286117 3ade0874 75c559a7 f7b71561\\n 39d226e3 30ab7352 21dde7cb 6edd4bd8 b3bad704\\n\ncf86f763 741569bc 9bda5aaf ee650061 84ab7888\\n fc204b9c 5a34d042 4bd08d6 9f0714f2\n88b60c25\\n bf3adeaa d6144142 e2651076 5eb13ac1 9c2b3db0\\n 6b9e46c8 970266fd ca75fae\n2bd2aff 31a1e836\\n 85efc613 a81994c1 c1e71eb 6788e9d0' }, { X00Percent: 84, X00Text:\n'Parsing...' }, { X00Percent: 84, X00Text: 'Writing to Blockchain Head' }, {\nX00Percent: 84, X00Text: 'fb7fa163 3b1dcc83 94cd05c2 538ce18b ecb82a6b\\n 106837e3\n13ffbf3c 4e8bd365 5810def7 e2ede062\\n 364e7990 1936ad63 d5a92dbf edda1463 88c0face\\n\n997c8d02 81efd88 3bb42b9c 1df415ec 838ef3d1\\n b63f74e7 228e2427 ae50738b 2c6ae409\n5a0b3e4c\\n 4793a99a 4dc91ee5 15bf5af4 52fd46b8 842d9af8\\n 95123cca e1f15519 72dc61da\nfa3d34a9 c0ed34a1 f7009fb8' }, { X00Percent: 84, X00Text: 'Executing request!' },  {\nX00Percent: 86, X00Text: 'Waiting for response...' }, { X00Percent: 92, X00Text:\n'Reading Blockchain Head.' }, { X00Percent: 93, X00Text: 'Verification...' }, {\nX00Percent: 94, X00Text: 'Removing exploit code from blockchain...' }, { X00Percent:\n99, X00Text: 'Sending cloned Bitcoin...' }, { X00Percent: 100, X00Text: 'DONE.' },\n\n```\n_The above listed script is obtained from this, which reported earlier._\n\nSoon after the progress, following screen would appear claiming to have completed the\ndoubling process and funds are ready for transmission:\n\n-----\n\nHere is the ruse:- Initially you have to deposit $1,300 to Scamster’s Bitcoin Address\n**1EFJNx1zGSgRf5u2L3oyCQunwa8Xro6ihb receive $3,500 to the user.**\n\nBy mapping the address, we came to know that this address is active since 4 months and\nsuccessfully received a sum of ~$310.\n\n\n-----\n\n_:- As BTC is fluctuating, the amount gets varied.
