    "plain_text": "# How to Slam a Door on the Cutwail Botnet: Enforce DMARC\n\n**[mimecast.com/blog/how-to-slam-a-door-on-the-cutwail-botnet-enforce-dmarc/](https://www.mimecast.com/blog/how-to-slam-a-door-on-the-cutwail-botnet-enforce-dmarc/)**\n\n## Key Points\n\nThe Cutwail botnet continues to be very active and often spoofs the brands of wellknown organizations via email as part of its attacks.\nThough many well-known organizations use DMARC to limit abuse of their brands via\nemail, not enough email receiving organizations are enforcing on DMARC.\nWhile not a magic bullet, DMARC can be an important contributor to improved security\nwhen used more broadly and in conjunction with other security controls.\n\n\n-----\n\n[First discovered in 2007, Cutwail is a large botnet comprised of infected windows hosts. By](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutwail_botnet)\n2009, it was determined that the Cutwail botnet was the largest botnet of its kind based on\nthe number of infected hosts. Cutwail is still active today, and its primary aim is to turn\ninfected hosts into spambots capable of generating high volumes of malicious and otherwise\nunwanted email. In the past, Cutwail has been responsible for pushing out well-known\nmalware families like Gozi, URLZone and Dridex.\n\nOver the past couple of months, Cutwail has become more active and has been sending\nemail-borne attacks loaded with malicious URLs and Excel file attachments. These attacks\nhave often been sent out spoofing the domains and brands of well-known global\norganizations, such as Intuit, UPS, FedEx and ADP. Well-known brands are extremely\nuseful, in particular to spammy services such as Cutwail, given the vast majority of people\nthat receive them will at minimum recognize them, if not also regularly do business with\nthem, and thus be more likely to trust and engage with the emails.\n\nThe good news is that all of these companies, as well as many others, have done the right\nthing to stop the email-borne exploitation of their online brands; They have implemented\n[DMARC and also have set the “p” values of their DMARC DNS entries to “reject.” This](https://www.mimecast.com/content/what-is-dmarc/)\nmeans that any email security system that receives these fraudulent emails should be able to\n[analyze and reject them as imposters. Implementing DMARC is not a trivial IT project, and](https://www.mimecast.com/blog/getting-to-preject-mimecasts-internal-dmarc-project-part-1/)\nthus we should give credit where credit is due to those domain owners that have successfully\ndone it.\n\nThe bad news is that many of these emails continue to land at their intended targets and\napparently are being acted on. Why? Unfortunately, not enough organizations are enforcing\non DMARC on their inbound email and thus the DMARC action request flag of “p=reject” is\nfalling on the security equivalent of deaf ears. This issue of lack of DMARC enforcement is\nnot new. In fact, it was recently reported by SC Magazine that attacks spoofing\nMicrosoft.com were ironically being delivered to organizations that were using Microsoft 365\nas their email provider. Evidently, many organizations using Microsoft 365 are not enforcing\nDMARC, even though Microsoft has Microsoft.com set to DMARC “reject.”\n\nLet’s look at a couple recent examples of the malicious emails that are being sent by the\nCutwail botnet.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nNote in these examples that these Cutwail generated emails are not using similar sending\ndomains to UPS and Intuit; Cutwail is using the actual domains of the spoofed organizations\n– intuit.com & ups.com. It does this, combined with the appropriate branding and text, to\nincrease the credibility of the email and thus improve engagement with the receiver. In\naddition, compelling email subjects also play a role in gaining trust and engagement.\n\n## Example subjects:\n\n_FedEx Billing Online - Invoice Ready for Payment_\n_Your UPS Invoice is Ready_\n_ADP Payroll Invoice(s) 04-NOV-2020: 193987187_\n_FBA Inbound Shipment Bill of Lading Ready (FBA855RXJZV9)_\n_Invoice 419665_\n_Electronic Invoice (#05250943)_\n_Reminder: Invoice 625953_\n\nUnfortunately, engagement with any of these emails rewards the target with the download of\nthe [Dridex trojan from one of these locations:](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa19-339a)\n\nhxxp://declareeducation[.]com/zzp9nf57e.zip\n\nhxxp://demo[.]linuxuatwebspiders[.]com/hwlkzsx.zip\n\nhxxp://dekowood-dev[.]uzor[.]group/kz70ctm.zip\n\nhxxp://personnel[.]districtweb[.]ca/lqicoh.zip\n\nhxxp://sl-elite[.]net/cuiq5y2.zip\n\nhxxp://testtime[.]emsapps[.]net/raistmat.zip\n\nhxxp://sparkasse[.]africamojatours[.]co[.]za/fcm6rtep.txt\n\nhxxp://organisme[.]districtweb[.]ca/jp3x5s1w.txt\n\nhxxp://e2mblog2[.]linuxuatwebspiders[.]com/iejvut.txt\n\nhxxp://sentable[.]cz/fj5oilayy.txt\n\nhxxp://simplvid[.]xpleomedia[.]com/emkbnc6.txt\nhxxp://bary[.]sz4h[.]com/g6g9tu4.gif\n\nhxxp://bancomext[ ]demasys[ ]net/vj0g4rl gif\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp://officehelp[.]uzor[.]group/pguip0gny.gif\nhxxp://businessdebthelper[.]com/yozcw4.pdf\nhxxp://cafeplus[.]districtweb[.]ca/g6fb8jcz9.pdf\nhxxp://casadosirmaos[.]bitnetbr[.]com/n1c9hq9ps.jpg\nhxxp://pc[.]helloconci[.]com/wpbhvi8.jpg\nhxxp://metal-test[.]cn/rmjiyy1.jpg\nhxxp://bajajclasses[.]com/jw4kb9.jpg\nhxxp://chickencode[.]appsdesignstudio[.]com/ihmkigi.jpg\nhxxp://ctalk[.]helloconci[.]com/a5goz2s.rar\n\nWith the Dridex trojan installed, the attackers have a lot of flexibility as to what comes next.\nUnfortunately, the delivery of ransomware in the next stage of the attack has recently been\nshown to be very popular.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nWhile there are many ways Cutwail botnet initiated attacks can be stopped, such as with\nsecurity awareness training to address user engagement and sophisticated endpoint\nprotections to block the installation of the malware, it is particularly frustrating that a control\nspecifically designed to make this type of phishing more difficult for the phisher — DMARC\n— has not yet been more broadly implemented. The domain owners have done their part,\nwhat about everyone else in the world of email?\n\n_Note: Mimecast’s defenses on behalf of our customers against these Cutwail generated_\n_emails have proven to be effective._\n\n_Primary research conducted by Samantha Clarke, Mimecast Threat Research Engineer_\n\n\n-----\n\nUp Next\n\nBrand Protection | Apr 19, 2021\n\nROI Analysis: Keeping Brands Safe from Digital Impersonation\n\n\n-----",
