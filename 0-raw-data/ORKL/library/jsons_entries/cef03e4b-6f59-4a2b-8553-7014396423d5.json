This\nactor initiated their most recent campaign on November 19, 2014 targeting multiple\norganizations. The attacker leveraged multiple exploits, targeting both CVE-20146332 and [CVE-2014-4113. CVE-2014-6332 was disclosed publicly on 2014-11-11 and is a](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc?rtc=1)\nWindows OLE Automation Array Remote Code Execution vulnerability. CVE-2014-4113 is a\n[privilege escalation vulnerability that was disclosed publicly on 2014-10-14.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/10/two-targeted-attacks-two-new-zero-days.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe use of CVE-2014-6332 is notable, as it demonstrates that multiple classes of actors,\nboth criminal and APT alike, have now incorporated this exploit into their toolkits. Further, the\nuse of both of these two known vulnerabilities in tandem is notable for APT3. This actor is\nhistorically known for leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities in widespread but infrequent\nphishing campaigns. The use of known exploits and more frequent attacks may indicate both\na shift in strategy and operational tempo for this group.\n\n**The Spearphish**\n\nThe body of the message is below:\n\n_One Month's Free Membership for The PLAYBOY ClUB 1080P HD VIDEOS 100,000_\n_PHOTOS 4,000_ _MODELS Nude Celebrities,Playmates,Cybergirls & More!

These files have the following metadata:\n\ndoc.exe (x86):\n\nMD5      492a839a3bf9c61b7065589a18c5aa8d\n\nSize     12288 bytes\n\nImport Hash  9342d18e7d315117f23db7553d59a9d1\n\ndoc.exe (x64):\n\nMD5      744a17a3bc6dbd535f568ef1e87d8b9a\n\nSize     13824 bytes\n\nCompile Time 2014-11-19 08:25:45Z\n\nImport Hash  2fab77a3ff40e4f6d9b5b7e813c618e4\n\ntest.exe:\n\nMD5      5c08957f05377004376e6a622406f9aa\n\nSize     11264 bytes\n\nCompile Time 2014-11-18 10:49:23Z\n\nImport Hash  f34d5f2d4577ed6d9ceec516c1f5a744\n\nThese payload files also have interesting PDB debug strings.\n\ninstall.exe:\n\nc:\\Users\\aa\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2008\\Projects\\MShell\\Release    \\MShell.pdb\n\ndoc.exe:\n\nc:\\Users\\aa\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2008\\Projects\\4113\\Release \\4113.pdb\n\n\n-----\n\ntest.exe:\n\nC:\\Users\\aa\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2010\\Projects\\MyRat\\Client\\Client\n\\obj\\x86\\Release\\Client.pdb\n\nThe most interesting PDB string is the “4113.pdb,” which appears to reference CVE-20144113. This CVE is a local kernel vulnerability that, with successful exploitation, would give\nany user SYSTEM access on the machine.\n\nThe malware component, test.exe, uses the Windows command \"cmd.exe\" /C whoami” to\nverify it is running with the elevated privileges of “System” and creates persistence by\ncreating the following scheduled task:\n\nschtasks /create /tn \"mysc\" /tr C:\\Users\\Public\\test.exe /sc ONLOGON   /ru \"System\"\n\nWhen executed, the malware first establishes a SOCKS5 connection to 192.157.198.103\nusing TCP port 1913. The malware sends the SOCKS5 connection request \"05 01 00\" and\nverifies the server response starts with \"05 00\". The malware then requests a connection to\n192.184.60.229 on TCP port 81 using the command \"05 01 00 01 c0 b8 3c e5 00 51\" and\nverifies that the first two bytes from the server are \"05 00\" (c0 b8 3c e5 is the IP address and\n00 51 is the port in network byte order).\n\nOnce the connection to the server is established, the malware expects a message containing\nat least three bytes from the server. These first three bytes are the command identifier. The\nfollowing commands are supported by the malware:\n\n\nCommand\nID\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n00 00 00 Content after command ID is written to:\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\notepad1.exe\n\n00 00 01 Deletes the files:\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\notepad.exe\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\newnotepad.exe\n\n00 00 02 Malware exits\n\n\n-----\n\n00 00 03 Malware downloads the URL that follows the command ID. The file is saved\nto:\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\notepad.exe\n\n00 00 04 Content after command ID is written to:\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\notepad2.exe\n\n00 00 05 The files notepad1.exe and notepad2.exe are concatenated together and\nwritten to C:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\newnotepad.exe and\nexecuted\n\n00 00 06 The contents of the following file is sent to the server:\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\note.txt\n\n00 00 07 The string following the command ID is executed using \"cmd /C\" and results\nare sent to server\n\n**Links to APT3**\n\nOn October 28, we observed APT3 sending out spearphishing messages containing a\ncompressed executable attachment. The deflated exe was a variant of the same downloader\ndescribed above and connected to 198.55.115.71 over port 1913 via SOCKS5 proxy. The\nsecondary payload in that case was detected as Backdoor.APT.CookieCutter (aka Pirpi) and\nalso named newnotepad.exe (MD5 8849538ef1c3471640230605c2623c67) and connected\nto the known APT3 domains:\n\ninform.bedircati[.]com\n\npn.lamb-site[.]com\n\n210.109.99.64\n\nThe 192.184.60.229 IP address seen in this current campaign also hosts securitywap[.]com\n– another known domain referenced in our Operation Clandestine Fox blog.\n\nDOMAIN FIRST SEEN LAST SEEN IP ADDRESS\n\nsecuritywap.com 2014-11-17 2014-11-20 192.184.60.229\n\n\n-----\n\nwww.securitywap.com 2014-11-17 2014-11-20 192.184.60.229\n\nIn addition, the join.playboysplus[.]com exploit and payload delivery site resolves to\n104.151.248.173.\n\nThis IP has hosted other domains used by APT3 in past campaigns:\n\nDOMAIN FIRST SEEN LAST SEEN IP ADDRESS\n\njoin.playboysplus[.]com 2014-11-21 2014-11-21 104.151.248.173\n\nwalterclean[.]com 2014-11-18 2014-11-20 104.151.248.173\n\nwww.walterclean[.]com 2014-11-18 2014-11-20 104.151.248.173\n\n[As we discussed in our previous blog detailing previous APT3 activity, the walterclean[.]com](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/06/clandestine-fox-part-deux.html)\nserved as a Plugx/Kaba command and control server.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAlthough APT3 is well known for employing zero-day exploits in their attacks, recent activity\nhas demonstrated that they will also attack targets with known exploits or social engineering.\n\nSince Operation Clandestine Fox, we have observed this actor execute multiple attacks that\ndid not rely on zero-day exploits. The combination of this sustained operational tempo\n**and lack of zero-day exploits may indicate that this group has changed strategy and**\n**has decided to attack more frequently and does not have steady access to zero-day**\n**exploit code. No matter the strategy, this actor has shown an ability to operate successfully.**\n\nIOCs for this threat can be found [here.](https://github.com/mandiant/iocs/tree/master/APT3)\n\n\n-----",
