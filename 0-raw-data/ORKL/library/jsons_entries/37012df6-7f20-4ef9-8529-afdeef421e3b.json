While running, it will display screen that\nshows Stalin while playing the USSR anthem and displaying a countdown until files are\ndeleted.\n\n**StalinLocker/StalinScreamer Lock Screen**\n\nWhen executed, StalinLocker will perform the following actions:\n\nExtract the \"USSR_Anthem.mp3\" file to the %UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local folder and\n[play it. This anthem is the same one heard in this YouTube video, but of much worse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U06jlgpMtQs)\nquality.\nIt will copy itself to %UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\stalin.exe and create an autorun\ncalled \"Stalin\" that starts the screenlocker/wiper when the user logs into the computer.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt will create %UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\fl.dat and write the current amount of\nseconds left divided by 3. So each time you start the program, the countdown is\nsignificantly less.\nAttempt to terminate processes other than Skype or Discord.\nTerminate Explorer.exe and taskmgr.exe.\nTries to create a Scheduled Task called \"Driver Update\" to launch Stalin.exe. This part\nof the code is currently throwing errors.\n\nStalinLocker will then display the above lock screen that contains a 10 minutes countdown\n[until your files are deleted or you enter a code. According to MalwareHunterTeam, this code](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/996030614896857095)\nis derived by subtracting the current date of when the program was executed by the\ndate 1922.12.30. If the user enters the correct code, the wiper will exit and delete the autorun.\n\n**Enter Code Source**\n\nOn the other hand, if the code is not entered by the time the countdown reaches zero, the\nscreenlocker will attempt to delete all of the files on each drive letter found on the computer.\nThis is done by going through all drive letters from A to Z and deleting any that are accessible\nas shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Source code to delete files on drive letters A-Z**\n\nThis wiper is currently in development, but could easily be made into a workable state.\nThankfully, most security vendors are detecting this either through definitions or heuristics,\nso make sure that you have an anti-virus program installed and updated to the latest\ndefinitions.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Beware: Onyx ransomware destroys files instead of encrypting them](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beware-onyx-ransomware-destroys-files-instead-of-encrypting-them/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n**Hashes:**\n```\nSHA256: 853177d9a42fab0d8d62a190894de5c27ec203240df0d9e70154a675823adf04\n\n```\n**Associated Files:**\n```\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\fl.dat\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\stalin.exe\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\USSR_Anthem.mp3\n\n```\n**Associated Registry Entries:**\n```\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Stalin\n%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\stalin.exe\n\n```\nAD\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\n\n-----\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
