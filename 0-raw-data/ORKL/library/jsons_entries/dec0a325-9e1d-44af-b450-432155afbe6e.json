It was deployed through Group Policy, which suggests thatth\nthe attackers had taken control of the victim’s Active Directory environment.\n\nSome of the wipers spotted by ESET in Ukraine early into Russia’s invasion –\n[HermeticWiper and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/02/24/hermeticwiper-new-data-wiping-malware-hits-ukraine/) [CaddyWiper – were in some instances also planted in the same](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/15/caddywiper-new-wiper-malware-discovered-ukraine/)\n[fashion.

For overwriting it uses 4096 bytes length block\nfilled with randomly generated byte”.\n\n[Two months ago, ESET detected a wave of RansomBoggs ransomware attacks in the war-](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/11/28/ransomboggs-new-ransomware-ukraine/)\ntorn country that were also linked to Sandworm.
