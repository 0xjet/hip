Of these, SeaDuke is a simple trojan made interesting by the fact that it's written in Python.\n\nAnd even more curiously, SeaDuke, with its built-in support for both Windows and Linux, is the first\n\ncross-platform malware we have observed from the Duke group. While SeaDuke is a single - albeit cross\nplatform - trojan, CloudDuke appears to be an entire toolset of malware components, or \"solutions\" as the\n\nDuke group apparently calls them. These components include a unique loader, downloader, and not one\n\nbut two different trojan components. CloudDuke also greatly expands on the Duke group's usage of cloud\n\nstorage services, specifically Microsoft's OneDrive, as a channel for both command and control as well as\n\nthe exfiltration of stolen data. Finally, some of the recent CloudDuke spear-phishing campaigns have born\n\na striking resemblance to CozyDuke spear-phishing campaigns from a year ago.\n\n**Linux support added with the cross-platform SeaDuke malware**\n\n[Last week, both Symantec and Palo Alto Networks published research on SeaDuke, a newer addition to the](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/forkmeiamfamous-seaduke-latest-weapon-duke-armory)\n\narsenal of trojans being used by the Duke group. While older malware by the Duke group has always been\n\nwritten with a combination of the C and C++ programming languages as well as assembly language,\n\nSeaDuke is peculiarly written in Python with multiple layers of obfuscation. This Python code is usually\n\nthen compiled into Windows executables using py2exe or pyinstaller. However, the Python code itself has\n\nbeen designed to work on both Windows and Linux. We therefore suspect, that the Duke group is also\n\nusing the same SeaDuke Python code to target Linux victims. This is the first time we have seen the Duke\n\ngroup employ malware to target Linux platforms.\n\n_An example of the cross-platform support found in SeaDuke._\n\n**A new set of solutions with the CloudDuke malware toolset**\n\n[Last week, we also saw Palo Alto Networks and Kaspersky Labs publish research on malware components](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/07/tracking-minidionis-cozycars-new-ride-is-related-to-seaduke/)\n\nthey respectively called MiniDionis and CloudLook MiniDionis and CloudLook are both components of a\n\n\n-----\n\nvarying functionality while partially relying on a shared code framework and always using the same\n\nloader. Based on PDB strings found in the samples, the malware authors refer to the CloudDuke\n\ncomponents as \"solutions\" with names such as \"DropperSolution\", \"BastionSolution\" and\n\n\"OneDriveSolution\". A list of PDB strings we have observed is below:\n\n- C:\\DropperSolution\\Droppers\\Projects\\Drop_v2\\Release\\Drop_v2.pdb\n\n- c:\\BastionSolution\\Shells\\Projects\\miniDionis4\\miniDionis\\obj\\Release\\miniDionis.pdb\n\n- c:\\BastionSolution\\Shells\\Projects\\miniDionis2\\miniDionis\\obj\\Release\\miniDionis.pdb\n\n- c:\\OneDriveSolution\\Shells\\Projects\\OneDrive2\\OneDrive\\obj\\x64\\Release\\OneDrive.pdb\n\nThe first of the CloudDuke components we have observed is a downloader internally called\n\n\"DropperSolution\". The purpose of the downloader is to download and execute additional malware on the\n\nvictim's system. In most observed cases, the downloader will attempt to connect to a compromised\n\nwebsite to download an encrypted malicious payload which the downloader will decrypt and execute.\n\nDepending on the way the downloader has been configured, in some cases it may first attempt to log in to\n\nMicrosoft's cloud storage service OneDrive and retrieve the payload from there. If no payload is available\n\nfrom OneDrive, the downloader will revert to the previously mentioned method of downloading from\n\ncompromised websites.\n\nWe have also observed two distinct trojan components in the CloudDuke toolset. The first of these,\n\ninternally called \"BastionSolution\", is the trojan that Palo Alto Networks described in their research into\n\n\"MiniDionis\". Interestingly, BastionSolution appears to functionally be an exact copy of SeaDuke with the\n\nonly real difference being the choice of programming language. BastionSolution also makes significant use\n\nof a code framework that is apparently internally called \"Z\". This framework provides classes for\n\nfunctionality such as encryption, compression, randomization and network communications.\n\n\n-----\n\n_A list of classes in the BastionSolution trojan, including multiple classes from the \"Z\" framework._\n\nClasses from the same \"Z\" framework, such as the encryption and randomization classes, are also used by\n\nthe second trojan component of the CloudDuke toolset. This second component, internally called\n\n\"OneDriveSolution\", is especially interesting because it relies on Microsoft's cloud storage service\n\nOneDrive as its command and control channel. To achieve this, OneDriveSolution will attempt to log into\n\nOneDrive with a preconfigured username and password. If successful, OneDriveSolution will then proceed\n\nto copy data from the victim's computer to the OneDrive account. It will also search the OneDrive account\n\nfor files containing commands for the malware to execute.\n\n_A list of classes in the OneDriveSolution trojan, including multiple classes from the \"Z\" framework._\n\nAll of the CloudDuke \"solutions\" use the same loader, a piece of code whose primary purpose is to decrypt\n\nthe embedded, encrypted solution, load it in memory and execute it. The Duke group has often employed\n\n\n-----\n\nmore versatile with support for multiple methods of loading and executing the final payload as well as the\n\nability to write to disk and execute additional malware components.\n\n**CloudDuke spear-phishing campaigns and similarities with CozyDuke**\n\nCloudDuke has recently been spread via spear-phishing emails with targets reportedly including\n\norganizations such as the US Department of Defense. These spear-phising emails have contained links to\n\ncompromised websites hosting zip archives that contain CloudDuke-laden executables. In most cases,\n\nexecuting these executables will have resulted in two additional files being written to the victim's hard\n\ndisk. The first of these files has been a decoy, such as an audio file or a PDF file while the second one has\n\nbeen a CloudDuke loader embedding a CloudDuke downloader, the so-called \"DropperSolution\". In these\n\ncases, the victim has been presented with the decoy file while in the background the downloader has\n\nproceeded to download and execute one of the CloudDuke trojans, \"OneDriveSolution\" or\n\n\"BastionSolution\".\n\n\n-----\n\n_[apparently been copied by the attackers from here.](https://www.ndi.org/files/NDI%20Georgia_April%202015%20Poll_Public%20Issues_ENG_VF_0.pdf)_\n\nInterestingly, however, some of the other CloudDuke spear-phishing campaigns we have observed this\n\nJuly have born a striking resemblance to CozyDuke spear-phishing campaigns seen almost exactly a year\n\nago, in the beginning of July 2014. In both spear-phishing campaigns, the decoy document has been the\n\nexact same PDF file, a \"US letter fax test page\" (28d29c702fdf3c16f27b33f3e32687dd82185e8b).\n\nSimilarly, the URLs hosting the malicious files have, in both campaigns, purported to be related to eFaxes.\n\nIt is also interesting to note, that in the case of the CozyDuke-inspired CloudDuke spear-phishing\n\ncampaign, the downloading and execution of the malicious archive linked to in the emails has not resulted\n\nin the execution of the CloudDuke downloader but in the execution of the \"BastionSolution\" component\n\nthereby skipping one step from the process described for the other CloudDuke spear-phishing campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The \"US letter fax test page\" decoy employed in both CloudDuke and CozyDuke spear-phishing_\n\n_campaigns._\n\n**Increasingly using cloud services to evade detection**\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft OneDrive specifically as part of their operations. Earlier this spring we released research on\n\nCozyDuke where we mentioned observing CozyDuke sometimes either directly use a OneDrive account to\n\nexfiltrate stolen data or alternatively CozyDuke downloading Visual Basic scripts that would copy stolen\n\nfiles to a OneDrive account and sometimes even retrieve files containing additional commands from the\n\nsame OneDrive account.\n\nIn these previous cases the Duke group has only used OneDrive as a secondary communication channel\n\nbut still relied on more traditional C&C channels for most of their actions. It is therefore interesting to\n\nnote that CloudDuke actually enables the Duke group to rely solely on OneDrive for every step of their\n\noperation from downloading the actual trojan, passing commands to the trojan and finally exfiltrating\n\nstolen data.\n\nBy relying solely on 3rd party web services, such as OneDrive, as their command and control channel, we\n\nbelieve the Duke group is trying to better evade detection. Large amounts of data being transferred from\n\nan organization's network to an unknown web server easily raises suspicions. However, data being\n\ntransferred to a popular cloud storage service is normal. What better way for an attacker to surreptitiously\n\ntransfer large amounts of stolen data than the same way people are transferring that same data every day\n\nfor legitimate reasons. (Coincidentally, the implications of 3rd party web services being used as command\n\n[and control channels is also the subject of an upcoming talk at the VirusBulletin 2015 conference).](https://www.virusbtn.com/conference/vb2015/abstracts/R-Lehtio.xml)\n\n**Directing limited resources towards evading detection and staying ahead of defenders**\n\nDeveloping even a single multipurpose malware toolset, never mind many, requires time and resources.\n\nTherefore it seems logical to attempt to reuse code such as supporting frameworks between different\n\ntoolsets.
