    "plain_text": "# Calypso APT: new group attacking state institutions\n\n**ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/calypso-apt-2019/**\n\nPositive Technologies\n\n## Contents\n\n Calypso APT\n\nThe PT Expert Security Center first took note of Calypso in March 2019 during threat\nhunting. Our specialists collected multiple samples of malware used by the group. They have\nalso identified the organizations hit by the attackers, as well as the attackers' C2 servers.\n\nOur data indicates that the group has been active since at least September 2016. The\nprimary goal of the group is theft of confidential data. Main targets are governmental\ninstitutions in Brazil, India, Kazakhstan, Russia, Thailand, and Turkey.\n\nOur data gives reason to believe that the APT group is of Asian origin . 1\n\n## Initial infection vector\n\nThe attackers accessed the internal network of a compromised organization by using an\nASPX web shell. They uploaded the web shell by exploiting a vulnerability or, alternately,\nguessing default credentials for remote access. We managed to obtain live traffic between\nthe attackers and the web shell.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Part of the recorded traffic\nThe traffic indicates the attackers connected from IP address 46.166.129.241. That host\ncontains domain tv.teldcomtv.com, the C2 server for the group's trojan. Therefore the\nhackers use C2 servers not only to control malware, but also to access hosts on\ncompromised infrastructures.\n\nThe attackers used the web shell to upload utilities and malware, execute commands, and 2 3\ndistribute malware inside the network. Examples of commands from the traffic are\ndemonstrated in the following screenshot.\n\nFigure 2. Commands sent to the web shell\n\n## Lateral movement\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group performed lateral movement by using the following publicly available utilities and\nexploits:\n\nSysInternals\nNbtscan\nMimikatz\nZXPortMap\nTCP Port Scanner\nNetcat\nQuarksPwDump\nWmiExec\nEarthWorm\nOS_Check_445\nDoublePulsar\nEternalBlue\nEternalRomance\n\nOn compromised computers, the group stored malware and utilities in either C:\\RECYCLER\nor C:\\ProgramData. The first option was used only on computers with Windows XP or\nWindows Server 2003 with NTFS on drive C.\n\nThe attackers spread within the network either by exploiting vulnerability MS17-010 or by\nusing stolen credentials. In one instance, 13 days after the attackers got inside the network,\nthey used DCSync and Mimikatz to obtain the Kerberos ticket of the domain administrator,\n\"passing the ticket\" to infect more computers.\n\nFigure 3. Obtaining account data via DCSync\nUse of such utilities is common for many APT groups. Most of those utilities are legitimate\nones used by network administrators. This allows the attackers to stay undetected longer.\n\n## Attribution\n\nIn one attack, the group used Calypso RAT, PlugX, and the Byeby trojan. Calypso RAT is\nmalware unique to the group and will be analyzed in detail in the text that follows.\n\nPlugX has traditionally been used by many APT groups of Asian origin. Use of PlugX in itself\ndoes not point to any particular group, but is overall consistent with an Asian origin.\n\nThe Byeby trojan was used in the SongXY malware campaign back in 2017. The version 4\nused now is modified from the original. The group involved in the original campaign is also of\nAsian origin. It performed targeted attacks on defense and government-related targets in\n\n\n-----\n\nRussia and the CIS countries. However, we did not find any clear-cut connection between\nthe two campaigns.\n\nWhen we analyzed the traffic between the attackers' server and the web shell, we found that\nthe attackers used a non-anonymous proxy server. The X-Forwarded-For header passed the\nattackers' IP address (36.44.74.47). This address would seem to be genuine (more precisely,\nthe first address in a chain of proxy servers).\n\nFigure 4. Headers of requests to the web shell\nThe IP address belongs to China Telecom. We believe the attackers could have been\ncareless and set up the proxy server incorrectly, thus disclosing their real IP address. This is\nthe first piece of evidence supporting the Asian origins of the group.\n\nFigure 5. Information on the discovered IP address\nThe attackers also left behind a number of system artifacts, plus traces in utility\nconfigurations and auxiliary scripts. These are also indicative of the group's origin.\n\nFor instance, one of the DoublePulsar configuration files contained external IP address\n103.224.82.47, presumably for testing. But all other configuration files contained internal\naddresses.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. IP address found in the DoublePulsar configuration\nThis IP address belongs to a Chinese provider, like the one before, and it was most likely left\nthere due to the attackers' carelessness. This constitutes additional evidence of the group's\nAsian origins.\n\nFigure 7. Information on the discovered IP address\nWe also found BAT scripts that launched ZXPortMap and EarthWorm for port forwarding.\nInside we found network indicators www.sultris.com and 46.105.227.110.\n\nFigure 8. Network indicators found in the BAT scripts\nThe domain in question was used for more than just tunneling: it also served as C2 server for\nthe PlugX malware we found on the compromised system. As already mentioned, PlugX is\ntraditionally used by groups of Asian origin, which constitutes yet more evidence.\n\nTherefore we can say that the malware and network infrastructure used all point to the group\nhaving an Asian origin.\n\n## Analyzing Calypso RAT malicious code\n\nThe structure of the malware and the process of installing it on the hosts of a compromised\nnetwork look as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Malware structure and installation process\n\n## Dropper\n\nThe dropper extracts the payload as an installation BAT script and CAB archive, and saves it\nto disk. The payload inside the dropper has a magic header that the dropper searches for.\nThe following figure shows an example of the payload structure.\n\nFigure 10. Structure of the payload hard-coded in the dropper\nThe dropper encrypts and decrypts data with a self-developed algorithm that uses CRC32 as\na pseudorandom number generator (PRNG). The algorithm performs arithmetic (addition and\nsubtraction) between the generated data and the data that needs to be encrypted or\ndecrypted.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Dropper with original encryption and decryption algorithm\nNow decrypted, the payload is saved to disk at %ALLUSERSPROFILE;\\TMP_%d%d, where\nthe last two numbers are replaced by random numbers returned by the rand() function.\nDepending on the configuration, the CAB archive contains one of three possibilities: a DLL\nand encrypted shellcode, a DLL with encoded loader in the resources, or an EXE file. We\nwere unable to detect any instances of the last variant.\n\n## Installation BAT script\n\nThe BAT script is encoded by substitution from a preset dictionary of characters; this\ndictionary is initialized in a variable in the installation script.\n\nFigure 12. Example of installation script obfuscation\nIn the decoded script, we can see comments hinting at the main functions of the script:\n\nREM Goto temp directory & extract file (go to TEMP directory and extract files there)\nREM Uninstall old version (uninstall the old version)\nREM Copy file (copy file)\nREM Run pre-install script (run the installation BAT script)\nREM Create service (create a service launching the malware at system startup)\nREM Create Registry Run (create value in the registry branch for autostart)\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the beginning of each script we can see a set of variables. The script uses these variables\nto save files, modify services, and modify registry keys.\n\nFigure 13. Initializing variables in deobfuscated script\nIn one of the oldest samples, compiled in 2016, we found a script containing comments for\nhow to configure each variable.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. Early version of the script with comments\n\n## Shellcode x86: stager\n\nIn most of the analyzed samples, the dropper was configured to execute shellcode. The\ndropper saved the DLL and encrypted shellcode to disk. The shellcode name was always\nidentical to that of the DLL, but had the extension .dll.crt. The shellcode is encrypted with the\nsame algorithm as the payload in the dropper. The shellcode acts as a stager providing the\ninterface for communicating with C2 and for downloading modules. It can communicate with\nC2 via TCP and SSL. SSL is implemented via the mbed_tls library.\n\nInitial analysis of the shellcode revealed that, in addition to dynamically searching for API\nfunctions, it runs one more operation that repeats the process of PE file address relocation.\nThe structure of the relocation table is also identical to that found in the PE file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. Shellcode relocations\nSince the process of shellcode address relocation repeats that of the PE file, we can assume\nthat initially the malware is compiled into a PE file, and then the builder turns it into\nshellcode. Debugging information found inside the shellcode supports that assumption.\n\nFigure 16. Debugging information inside the shellcode\nAPI functions are searched for dynamically and addresses are relocated, after which the\nconfiguration hard-coded inside the shellcode is parsed. The configuration contains\ninformation about the C2 server address, protocol used, and connection type.\n\nFigure 17. Example of shellcode configuration\nNext the shellcode creates a connection to C2. A random packet header is created and sent\nto C2. In response the malware receives a network key, saves it, and then uses it every time\nwhen communicating with C2. Then the information about the infected computer is collected\nand sent to C2.\n\nNext three threads are launched. One is a heartbeat sending an empty packet to C2 every\n54 seconds. The other processes and executes commands from C2. As for the third thread,\nwe could not figure out its purpose, because the lines implementing its functionality were\nremoved from the code. All we can tell is that this thread was supposed to \"wake up\" every\n54 seconds, just like the first one.\n\n## Modules\n\nWe have not found any modules so far. But we can understand their functionality by\nanalyzing the code responsible for communication between the shellcode and the modules.\nEach module is shellcode which is given control over the zero offset of the address. Each\nmodule exists in its own separate container. The container is a process with loaded module\n\n\n-----\n\ninside. By default, the process is svchost.exe. When a container is created, it is injected with\na small shellcode that causes endless sleep. This is also hard-coded in the main shellcode,\nand more specifically in JustWait. pdb, most likely.\n\nThe module is placed inside with an ordinary writeprocess and is launched either with\nNtCreateThreadEx or, on pre-Vista operating systems, CreateRemoteThread.\n\nTwo pipes are created for each module. One is for transmitting the data from the module to\nC2; the other for receiving data from C2. Quite likely the modules do not have their own\nnetwork code and instead use the pipes to communicate with external C2 through the main\nshellcode.\n\nFigure 18. Creating pipes for modules\nEach module has a unique ID assigned by C2. Containers are launched in different ways. A\ncontainer can be launched in a specific session open in the OS or in the same session as the\nstager. In any particular session, the container is launched by getting the handle for the\nsession token of a logged-in user, and then launching the process as that user.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19. Creating container process in a different session\n\n## Commands\n\nThe malware we studied can process 12 commands. All of them involve modules in one way\nor another. Here is a list of all IDs of commands found in the malware, along with those that\nthe malware itself sends in various situations.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Network code\n\nNetwork communication is initialized after the network key is received from C2. To do that,\nthe malware sends a random sequence of 12 bytes to C2. In response the malware also\nexpects 12 bytes, the zero offset of which must contain the same value (_DWORD) as prior\nto sending. If the check is successful, four bytes at offset 8 are taken from the response and\ndecrypted with RC4. The key is four bytes sent previously, also located at offset 8. This result\nis the network key. The key is saved and then used to send data.\n\nAll transmitted packets have the following structure.\n```\nstruct Packet{\n  struct PacketHeader{\n  _ DWORD key;\n  _ WORD cmdId;\n  _ WORD szPacketPayload;\n  _ DWORD moduleId;\n};\n  _ BYTE [max 0xF000] packetPayload;\n};\n\n```\nA random four-byte key is generated for each packet. It is later used to encrypt part of the\nheader, starting with the cmdld field. The same key is used to encrypt the packet payload.\nEncryption uses the RC4 algorithm. The key itself is encrypted by XOR with the network key\nand saved to the corresponding field of the packet header.\n\n## Shellcode x64: stager (base backdoor)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis shellcode is very similar to the previous one, but it deserves a separate description\nbecause of differences in its network code and method of launching modules. This shellcode\nhas basic functions for file system interaction which are not available in the shellcode\ndescribed earlier. Also the configuration format, network code, and network addresses used\nas C2 by this shellcode are similar to code from a 2018 blog post by NCC Group about a\nGh0st RAT variant. However, we did not find a connection to Gh0st RAT.\n\nThis variant of the shellcode has only one communication channel, via SSL. The shellcode\nimplements it with two legitimate libraries, libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll, hard-coded in the\nshellcode itself.\n\nFirst the shellcode performs a dynamic search for API functions and loads SSL libraries. The\nlibraries are not saved to disk; they are read from the shellcode and mapped into memory.\nNext the malware searches the mapped image for the functions it needs to operate.\n\nThen it parses the configuration string, which is also hard-coded in the shellcode. The\nconfiguration includes information on addresses of C2 servers and schedule for malware\noperation.\n\nFigure 20. Sample of configuration string\nAfter that the malware starts its main operating cycle. It checks if the current time matches\nthe malware operational time. If not, the malware sleeps for about 7 minutes and checks\nagain. This happens until the current time is the operational time, and only then does the\nmalware resume operation. Figure 20 demonstrates an example in which the malware\nremains active at all times on all days of the week.\n\nWhen the operational time comes, the malware goes down the list of C2 servers specified in\nthe configuration and tries to connect. The malware subsequently interacts with whichever of\nthe C2 servers it is able to successfully connect to first.\n\nThen the malware sends the information on the infected computer (such as computer name,\ncurrent date, OS version, 32-bit vs. 64-bit OS and CPU, and IP addresses on network\ninterfaces and their MAC addresses). After the information on the infected computer is sent,\nthe malware expects a response from C2. If C2 returns the relevant code, sending is\ndeemed successful and the malware proceeds. If not, the malware goes back to sequentially\nchecking C2 addresses. Next it starts processing incoming commands from C2.\n\n## Modules\n\n\n-----\n\nEach module is a valid MZPE file mapped in the address space of the same process as the\nshellcode. Also the module can export the GetClassObject symbol, which receives control\nwhen run (if required).\n\nEach module has its own descriptor created by a command from C2. The C2 server sends a\nbyte array (0x15) describing the module. The array contains information on the module:\nwhether the module needs to be launched via export, module type (in other words, whether it\nneeds pipes for communicating with C2), module size, entry point RVA (used if there is no\nflag for launching via export), and module data decryption key. The key is, by and large, the\ndata used to format the actual key.\n\nFigure 21. Module decryption\nWe should also point out that decryption takes place only if modKey is not equal to the\n7AC9h constant hard-coded in the shellcode. This check affects only the decryption process.\nIf modKey does equal the constant, the malware will immediately start loading the module.\nThis means the module is not encrypted.\n\nEach module is launched in a separate thread created specially for that purpose. Launching\nwith pipes looks as follows:\n\nThe malware creates a thread for the module, starts mapping the module, and gives it\ncontrol inside the newly created thread.\nThe malware creates a new connection to the current working C2.\nThe malware creates a pipe with the name derived from the following format string: \\\\.\\\npipe\\windows@#%02XMon (%02X is replaced by a value that is received from С2 at\nthe same time as the command for launching the module).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware launches two threads passing data from the pipe to C2 and vice versa,\nusing the connection created during the previous step. Two more pipes,\n\\\\.\\pipe\\windows@#%02Xfir and \\\\.\\pipe\\windows@#%02Xsec, are created inside the\nthreads. The pipe ending in \"fir\" is used to pass data from the module to C2. The pipe\nending in \"sec\" is used to pass data and commands from C2 to the modules.\n\nThe second thread processing the commands from C2 to the modules has its own handler.\nThis is described in more details in the Commands section. For now we can only say that\none of the commands can start a local asynchronous TCP server. That server will accept\ndata from whoever connects to it, send it to C2, and forward it back from C2. It binds to\n127.0.0.1 at whichever port it finds available, starting from 5000 and trying possible ports one\nby one.\n\n## Commands\n\nThe following is a list of IDs for commands the malware can receive, along with commands\nthe malware itself sends in various situations.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Network code\n\nEach packet has the following structure:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nStruct Packet{\n    Struct Header{\n    _ DWORD rand _ k1;\n  _ DWORD rand _ k2;\n  _ DWORD rand  _ k3;\n  _ DWORD szPaylaod;\n  _ DWORD protoConst;\n  _ DWORD packetId;\n  _ DWORD unk1;\n  _ DWORD packetKey;\n};\n  _ BYTE [max 0x2000] packetPayload;\n};\n\n```\nEach packet has a unique key calculated as szPayload + GetTickCount() %\nhardcodedConst. This key is saved in the corresponding packetKey header field. It is used to\ngenerate another key for encrypting the packet header with RC4 (encryption will not occur\nwithout the packetKey field). RC4 key generation is demonstrated in the following figure.\n\nFigure 22. Generating RC4 key for the header\nThen yet another RC4 key is generated from the encrypted fields szPayload, packetId,\nprotoConst and rand k3 This key is used to encrypt the packet payload\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 23. Generating RC4 key for the packet payload\nNext the shellcode forms the HTTP headers and the created packet is sent to C2. In\naddition, each packet gets its own number, indicated in the URL. Modules may pass their ID,\nwhich is used to look up the connection established during module launch. Module ID 0 is\nreserved for the main connection of the stager.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 24. Forming HTTP headers\n\n## Other options\n\nAs we noted, the dropper may be configured to launch not just shellcode, but executable files\ntoo. We found the same dropper-stager but with different payloads: Hussar and\nFlyingDutchman.\n\n## Dropper-stager\n\nThe main tasks of this dropper are unpacking and mapping the payload, which is encoded\nand stored in resources. The dropper also stores encoded configuration data and passes it\nas a parameter to the payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25. Unpacking the payload\n\n## Hussar\n\nIn essence Hussar is similar to the shellcodes described earlier. It allows loading modules\nand collecting basic information about the computer. It can also add itself to the list of\nauthorized applications in Windows Firewall.\n\n## Initialization\n\nTo start, the malware parses the configuration provided to it by the loader.\n\nFigure 26. Configuration sample\nConfiguration structure is as follows:\n```\nStruct RawConfig{\n    _ DWORD protocolId;\n    _ BYTE c2Strings [0x100];\n};\n\n```\nThe protocolId field indicates the protocol to be used for communicating with C2. There are a\ntotal of three possibilities:\n\n\n-----\n\nIf protocolId equals 1, a TCP-based protocol will be used.\nIf protocolId equals 2, the protocol will be HTTP-based.\nIf protocolId equals 3, it will be HTTPS-based.\n\nThe time stamp is calculated from the registry from the key SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\\nCurrentVersion\\Telephony (Perf0 value). If reading the time stamp is impossible, \"temp\" is\nadded to the computer identifier.\n\nFigure 27. Generating computer ID\nNext Hussar creates a window it will use for processing incoming messages.\n\nFigure 28. Creating dispatcher window\nThen the malware adds itself to the list of authorized applications in Windows Firewall, using\nthe INetFwMgr COM interface.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo complete initialization, Hussar creates a thread which connects to C2 and periodically\npolls for commands. The function running in the thread uses the WSAAsyncSelect API to\nnotify the window that actions can be performed with the created connection (socket is\n\"ready for reading,\" \"connected,\" or \"closed\").\n\nFigure 29. Communication between the open socket and the window\nIn general, for transmitting commands, the malware uses the window and Windows\nmessaging mechanism. The window handle is passed to the modules, and the dispatcher\nhas branches not used by the stager, so we can assume that the modules can use the\nwindow for communication with C2.\n\n## Modules\n\nEach module is an MZPE file loaded into the same address space as the stager. The module\nmust export the GetModuleInfo function, which is called by the stager after image mapping.\n\n\n-----\n\n## FlyingDutchman\n\nThe payload provides remote access to the infected computer. It includes functions such as\nscreenshot capture, remote shell, and file system operations. It also allows managing system\nprocesses and services. It consists of several modules.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe group has several successful hacks to its credit, but still makes mistakes allowing us to\nguess its origins. All data given here suggests that the group originates from Asia and uses\nmalware not previously described by anyone. The Byeby trojan links the group to SongXY,\nencountered by us previously, which was most active in 2017.\n\nWe keep monitoring the activities of Calypso closely and expect the group will attack again.\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\n### Network\n\n23.227.207.137\n\n45.63.96.120\n\n45.63.114.127\n\n\n-----\n\nr01.etheraval.com\n\ntc.streleases.com\n\ntv.teldcomtv.com\n\nkrgod.qqm8.com\n\n### File indicators\n\n Droppers and payload\n\nC9C39045FA14E94618DD631044053824\n\nE24A62D9826869BC4817366800A8805C\n\nF0F5DA1A4490326AA0FC8B54C2D3912D\n\nCB914FC73C67B325F948DD1BF97F5733\n\n6347E42F49A86AFF2DEA7C8BF455A52A\n\n0171E3C76345FEE31B90C44570C75BAD\n\n17E05041730DCD0732E5B296DB16D757\n\n69322703B8EF9D490A20033684C28493\n\n22953384F3D15625D36583C524F3480A\n\n1E765FED294A7AD082169819C95D2C85\n\nC84DF4B2CD0D3E7729210F15112DA7AC\n\nACAAB4AA4E1EA7CE2F5D044F198F0095\n\n### Droppers with the same payload\n\n85CE60B365EDF4BEEBBDD85CC971E84D\n\n1ED72C14C4AAB3B66E830E16EF90B37B\n\nCB914FC73C67B325F948DD1BF97F5733\n\n### Payload without dropper\n\nE3E61F30F8A39CD7AA25149D0F8AF5EF\n\n974298EB7E2ADFA019CAE4D1A927AB07\n\nAA1CF5791A60D56F7AE6DA9BB1E7F01E\n\n05F472A9D926F4C8A0A372E1A7193998\n\n0D532484193B8B098D7EB14319CEFCD3\n\nE1A578A069B1910A25C95E2D9450C710\n\n2807236C2D905A0675878E530ED8B1F8\n\n847B5A145330229CE149788F5E221805\n\nD1A1166BEC950C75B65FDC7361DCDC63\n\nCCE8C8EE42FEAED68E9623185C3F7FE4\n\n### Hussar\n\n\n-----\n\n43B7D48D4B2AFD7CF8D4BD0804D62E8B\n\n617D588ECCD942F243FFA8CB13679D9C\n\n### FlyingDutchman\n\n5199EF9D086C97732D97EDDEF56591EC\n\n06C1D7BF234CE99BB14639C194B3B318\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK\n\n\n-----\n\n1.
