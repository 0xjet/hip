We were able to detect the aftermath of a\nsuccessful phishing attack against an employee at the company, which resulted in an\ninfection of a host in the client enterprise by Emotet malware. While we are still working with\nour partner to assist in triage and remediation, we wanted to share our findings to increase\nthe communities ability to collectively defend against these types of attacks. We posit that\nthis attack is part of a new campaign by the MUMMY SPIDER threat group, designed to test\nupdated techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTP) for future campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis article discusses the threat group behind the attack and breaks down the postcompromise activity that occurred within the client enterprise. This attack bypassed the client\nenterprise’s anti-virus protection and security products; however, IronNet’s behavioral\nanalytics were able to detect the post-compromise activity and quickly alert the customer to\nthe infection.\n\n## MUMMY SPIDER returns\n\n[MUMMY SPIDER (also known as TA54) is a threat group that utilizes various malicious](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-february-mummy-spider/)\nspam (malspam) email campaigns to deploy Emotet malware. First detected in 2014, Emotet\nis a modular, polymorphic trojan that is capable of evading signature-based detection and\nspreading throughout a victim network to compromise additional systems. Emotet often\nserves as a first–or second–stage malware that can drop and download further payloads,\nwhich could ultimately lead to data theft, remote control of systems, financial losses, and\noperational disruptions. An international law enforcement effort succeeded in taking down\nthe Emotet botnet in 2021, but it has since resurfaced with a new focus on targeted attacks\nrather than the previous “spray and pray” tactics it was once known for. We cannot claim with\n[absolute certainty that the group is linked to Russia; however, on April 20th 2022, a joint alert](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-110a)\nissued by cybersecurity agencies from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.S., and the\nU.K. mentioned the MUMMY SPIDER threat group when warning organizations of the threat\nof Russian cyber attacks on critical infrastructure.\n\nUnlike most threat groups, MUMMY SPIDER operates atypically; they will hibernate for\nmonths at a time and conduct operations in short bursts over a several month period.\nAdditionally, [recent reports attributed to this group have coincided with holiday seasons.](https://security-soup.net/quick-post-mummy-spider-delivers-emotet-maldocs-for-the-holidays/)\nHistorically, when the group resumed operations, they utilized new variants of Emotet in an\nattempt to bypass security efforts. In the case of the compromise detailed in this article, we\nbelieve that the MUMMY SPIDER threat group may have been testing a new bypass for\n[Microsoft disabling macros by default. This capability involves using OneDrive URLs or XLL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked)\n[files instead of traditional macro-enabled documents.ProofPoint believes that the reason for](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/emotet-tests-new-delivery-techniques)\nthe lower-than-normal target volume is because MUMMY SPIDER is testing the success of\nthis new technique before adopting it on a larger scale.\n\n## Behavioral detection and incident analysis\n\nOn April 29th, 2022, at 0100UTC, an enterprise user received a phishing email with a zip file\nattached. The archive contained an XLL file that the victim accidentally executed on the host\ncomputer. This triggered a series of requests to multiple external domains, which hosted the\nnew Emotet malware. While a majority of these outbound requests were blocked by\nenterprise security products, an outbound session succeeded to\n```\ngla[.]ge:80/old/PuVaff/ at 0151UTC and a DLL (Emotet) was downloaded. The\n\n```\nsample was not flagged as malicious by VirusTotal at the time of detection. IronNet observed\nthe host making a large volume of outbound requests to various remote servers in an\n\n\n-----\n\nattempt to establish command and control (C2) communications. Similar to the domain\nrequests, a majority of these attempts were blocked, but a small number were successful.\nIronDefense was able to generate alerts based on the anomalous nature of the domains, two\ninstances of C2 beaconing activity, and numerous threat-intelligence-based alerts.\n\nAfter reporting this activity to the customer, we were informed that the attack occurred on the\nFriday before a major holiday weekend; this suggests a potential attack of opportunity, which\ncorroborates with the new TTP that MUMMY SPIDER is assumed to be operating under.\nIronNet was able to alert the customer shortly after their workday ended Friday, enabling\nisolation of the infected host and mitigation during the long weekend. There is no evidence of\nlateral movement attempts from the infected host, supporting the assessment that this was\nisolated and thus part of MUMMY SPIDER’s new test campaign model.\n\n## Thread Hijacking\n\nAfter initial triage, IronNet’s threat hunters and intel analysts requested a copy of the\nphishing email used and were able to categorize this as a thread hijacking attack. Thread\nHijacking is a process in which a threat actor compromises and injects themselves into an\nemail thread in an effort to increase legitimacy and trust. In this instance, the actors\nleveraged an email chain that involved updating a spreadsheet of delivery information,\nproviding a legitimate use case for the phishing target to open the attached file. While the\nsender's address was not from a legitimate enterprise domain, the email was able to avoid\nsuspicion from the user.\n\nWhen we categorized this as a thread hijacking attack, we uncovered additional concerns\n[that we began to investigate. Palo Alto released an article in 2020 detailing this type of](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/emotet-thread-hijacking/)\nattack, which indicates the post-infection goal is exfiltrating host data via C2. This discovery\nsuggests the enterprise user was likely targeted, evidenced by the email being sent\nspecifically to the user. We were able to use this information to inform the customer that\n\n\n-----\n\nthere were likely additional infections of one or more personnel from the original email chain,\nmaking them aware of additional thread hijacking attacks that would be likely using emails\nfrom the victim user.\n\nIronNet conducted a review of indicators of compromise (IOC) associated with recent\nMUMMY SPIDER campaigns and identified external scanning attempts against several\nenterprise customers. While most of these appeared to be generic scanning, one instance\ninvolved a large volume of scanning against customer Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)\nservers. We conclude this was likely an attempt to identify more malspam targets. IronNet\nhas since deployed Threat Intelligence Rules (TIR) and propagated the incident alerts\nthroughout the IronDome, enabling other IronNet customers to have increased detection\ncapability and reduced response time through collective defense.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n[Recent reporting indicates that MUMMY SPIDER and other actors that use Emotet have](https://www.cyberscoop.com/emotet-tweaks-microsoft-botnet-russia/)\nbegun to conduct more targeted operations, increasing the likelihood of spear-phishing\nagainst enterprise employees. While preventing all enterprise users from being the victim of\na phishing attack would be ideal, it is statistically unlikely. Awareness training is\nrecommended and effective, but having additional layers of security in the event of\ncompromise is critical. This incident highlights the importance of behavioral detections as\nthreat actors work to evade traditional security tools and signature-based detections.\nIronNet’s ability to detect the behavioral aspects of this attack prevented the threat group\nfrom having extended access to the customer’s enterprise over a long weekend and\npotentially causing further damage.\n\n## IOCs\n\nURLs:\n```\n   gakudou[.]com:80/photo06/hEu/\n   giasotti[.]com:80/js/Khc6mb0zx4KoWX/\n   plresende[.]com:80/pcinfor/cq/\n   thomasmanton[.]com:80/wp-includes/owZnpWmH4D8j/\n   gla[.]ge:80/old/PuVaff/\n   gccon[.]in/UploadedFiles/UYtJNrT2llxy1/\n\n```\nExtract from C2 Config via Tria.ge\n\n```\n149.56.131.28:8080\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n5.9.116.246:8080\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n206.189.28.199:8080\n\n```\n\nTria.ge:\n\n[https://tria.ge/220428-23e5saffg3/behavioral1#report](https://tria.ge/220428-23e5saffg3/behavioral1#report)\n\n## IronNet Analytics Mapped to MITRE TTPs\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK**\n\n**IronNet Analytic** **Tactic** **Technique**\n\nConsistent Beaconing HTTP/TLS [Command and Control](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/) [Application Layer Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/)\n\nDomain Analysis HTTP/TLS [Command and Control](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/) [Application Layer Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/)\n\nAbout Ironnet\n\nFounded in 2014 by GEN (Ret.)
