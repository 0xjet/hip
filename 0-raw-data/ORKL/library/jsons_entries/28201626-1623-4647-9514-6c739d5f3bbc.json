According to data from Europol, the group is tied to cyberattacks\nagainst at least 100 banks across the world, stealing about one billion euros from them.\n\n[Although the alleged ringleader has been arrested in Spain this year, and three individuals](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/leader-of-carbanak-cobalt-hacker-group-who-stole-over-1bil-arrested-in-spain/)\n[believed to be members of the hacking crew have been charged at the beginning of the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-charges-three-members-of-fin7-carbanak-hacker-group/)\nmonth, the group continues to operate.\n\n## Phishing email uses domain similar to financial organization\n\nArbor Networks ASERT Team on August 13 noticed a new campaign bearing the Cobalt\nsignature. The target was NS Bank in Russia. ASERT's threat-intelligence partner Intel471\ndiscovered another campaign aimed at Carpatica Commercial Bank/Patria Bank in\nRomania.\n\nThe emails delivered to the victims purported to be from other institutions related to the\nfinancial industry, a tactic intended to increase confidence in launching the weaponized files\nin the attachment.\n\nThe researchers with ASERT examined the domain rietumu[.]me, which is a command and\ncontrol (C2) server connected to Cobalt activity, and found an email address that led them\nto five new domains created on August 1, one of them being inter-kassa[.]com.\n\nThe other domains the experts uncovered, and clearly trying to impersonate financial\ninstitutions are:\n\n[compass[.]plus - probably posing as BBVA Compass Bancshares or](https://www.bbvacompass.com/) Compass\nSavings Bank\n[eucentalbank[.]com - probably posing as the European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/)\neuropecentalbank[.]com - probably posing as the European Central Bank\n[unibank[.]credit - probably posing as any Unibank financial entities across the globe](https://www.google.com/search?q=unibank)\n\nInterkassa is a legitimate payment processing system based in Georgia (the country)\noffering over 50 payment instruments for online transactions in multiple currencies.\n\nLooking for samples associated with this domain, ASERT found a phishing email for an NS\nBank employee. Contrary to the \"norm,\" it included two links to malicious files: one to a\nWord document with obfuscated VBA scripts, and one for downloading a binary with the\nextension changed to JPG.\n\n## Email delivers links to two weaponized files\n\nThe weaponized Office file needs to have permission to run macros in order to be able to\nexecute the VBA script. But if macros are enabled, a convoluted operation is\ntriggered, ending with downloading and running a JavaScript backdoor very similar in\n\n\n-----\n\nfunctionality with another tool linked to the Cobalt group.\n\nThe executable file posing as JPEG image in the email to NS Bank came from hxxp://sepaeuropa[.]eu, a domain pretending to be related to the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA),\nan initiative for easier cross-border payments within the European Union space.\n\n\"UPX unpacked, is an executable rather than an image file. The sample is littered with junk\ncode that spends CPU cycles before proceeding to de-obfuscate itself. The unpacking\nroutine involves overwriting itself in memory with another executable,\" ASERT [explains.](https://asert.arbornetworks.com/double-the-infection-double-the-fun/)\n\nFollowing the analysis of this binary, the researchers determined it was a variant of\nCobInt/COOLPANTS - a [reconnaissance backdoor found on a C2 operated by Cobalt](https://www.group-ib.com/blog/renaissance)\nhackers in the past.\n\n\n-----\n\nMaking use of separate infection points in one email with two separate C2s makes this\nemail peculiar. One could speculate that this would increase the infection odds,\" ASERT\nconcludes.\n\n## Spear phishing employee at Romanian bank\n\nThe spear-phishing campaign against Carpatica Commercial Bank, now merged with Patria\nBank, delivered malware that shared the same program database with a sample from the\ndomain rietumul[.]me, tied to the Cobalt group.\n\nThe header of the phishing email shows that the attacker used SEPA once more as a cover\nfor the malicious activity, using SEPA Europe as the sender of the message.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is unclear when Intel471 caught the phishing email, but two weeks ago the Romanian\n[Intelligence Service (SRI) announced that it had solid information about cyberattacks aimed](https://www.sri.ro/articole/atacuri-cibernetice-de-amploare-in-perioada-iunie-august-2018)\nat financial institutions in Romania.\n\nAccording to the communication, the events occurred between June and August, a\ntimeframe that overlaps with the campaigns discovered by the researchers at the two\ncompanies.\n\nSRI says that analysis from its cyberintelligence unit, National Cyberint Center (CNC),\nshows that the arsenal of attack tools used by the hackers includes Cobalt Strike, a piece of\nsoftware for penetration testing. This is confirmed by the numerous reports from various\nsecurity companies that examined the group's activity.\n\n## Phishing is how it starts\n\nSpear-phishing is an initial stage of the attack, where the group tries to gain a foothold\naccess in the bank's digital infrastructure. Subsequent activity from the Cobalt group\ntypically consists in reconnaissance and moving laterally inside the network.\n\nAfter they learn how the target operates and get the same access as high-level employees,\nthe hackers could execute money transfers, command ATMs, and steal money from\npayment gateways and SWIFT systems.\n\n[Cobalt](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cobalt/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
