    "plain_text": "# The MsnMM Campaigns\n\n**The Earliest Naikon APT Campaigns**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nOver time, the Naikon APT appears to have used specific toolsets against organizations within\na designated country, as though each campaign was focused on one country. There is\nsometimes crossover between campaigns in several ways: the backdoors they deliver, the\ninfiltration techniques, and the overall infrastructure. Backdoor functionality can also cross\ncampaigns and tools. For example, sometimes we see an “inject” variant dropping a “sys10”\nbackdoor. Or a naikon backdoor dropping a rarstone backdoor. Again, this particular actor is\nresponsible for the MsnMM and Naikon campaigns deploying the following backdoors and tools:\n\n  - sslMM\n\n  - winMM\n\n  - exe_exchange\n\n  - wininetMM/sakto\n\n  - inject\n\n  - sys10\n\n  - xsControl/naikon and plugins\n\n  - rarstone\n\n  - second stage tools\n\nThe Naikon group also deployed a lesser-known set of second stage tools. They mixed together\nlegitimate system administration tools with offensive network reconnaissance tools, including a\ncustom network and service scanner and an attack codeset based on old Honker Union\ncodebase shared on Chinese-speaking forums. See “Second Stage Tools”.\n\nFor years, Naikon downloaders/backdoors were delivered to victim systems with kit-produced\nCVE-2012-0158 spear-phish. This exploit builder kit was shared amongst multiple APTs,\nbecause we see the same exploits dropping tools from various groups. Many of these exploit\nattachments were blocked by our advanced exploit protection (AEP) on customer systems in\nVietnam, Myanmar, the Philippines, and organizations related to the energy sector in these and\nother ASEAN nations. Some of these backdoors and spear-phish activities also showed up in\nthe Hardore Charlie CEIEC dump. In Jan 2014, we observed in some targets the increase of\n“right-to-left-override” (RTLO) naming schemes for initial payload delivery. In addition to its\ncustom toolset, it appears to test freely-distributed tools - in December 2013, it pushed out\n“Everything32” to victim systems, and TeamViewer was used as well. It is likely that the group\nfaced difficulties when it came up against anti-malware products and tried abusing legitimate\ntools for anti-malware evasion. Finally, this threat actor deploys a custom pdf binding tool, to\nadd to its effective but low-tech toolset.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Naikon attackers can be, and in fact have been precise in social-engineering their targets.\nData collection prior to an attack may have included the following data points:\n\n  - full names\n\n  - email addresses and status (active or inactive)\n\n  - date of birth and age\n\n  - interests in current events\n\n  - nationality\n\n  - gender\n\n  - previous email and social network communications to and from a target\n\n  - language spoken\n\nVictims of the early campaigns were located mostly throughout Myanmar, Vietnam, Singapore,\nLaos, Malaysia, and the Philippines. There are other locations where Naikon’s victims can be\nfound, but these countries stand out.\n\nTo get in to target networks, the Naikon APT relied on email as an attack vector. It first\ncompromised victim systems using common spear-phishing techniques, Such as cve-2012-0158 exploit\n\nattachments, attachments altered with RTLO techniques, and a combination of icon-spoofing and\nname padding for executables. The MsnMM campaigns featured ripped images and documents\nre-used for spear-phish decoys, and we see that technique reapplied throughout other Naikon\nAPT campaigns. The winMM components were also delivered to Myanmar victims throughout\nmid-2013 using RTLO and icon-spoofing techniques and sometimes even simpler icon\nspoofing+double extension+extra spacing in attachment filenames. For example, many of the\nBackdoor.Win32.MsnMM.i (winMM) executable filenames maintained almost 200 spaces,\nlooking like this:\n“letter to Gov office.doc                            .exe”\n\nThe Naikon APT used multiple backdoors presenting a variety of behaviors over time, but\nclusters of indicators were fairly consistent into 2015.\n\n**Shared Exploit Generation Kit**\n\nIt’s interesting that what appear to be multiple campaigns and crews all use a kit that generates\nCVE-2012-0158 exploits embedded with arbitrary backdoors for spear-phishing. One of the\ninteresting characteristics of the Naikon APT’s kit-produced shellcode is its runtime function\noffset calculations and control flow are built to jump past behavior-based protection and\nsandbox analysis. Each of the win32 api shellcode calls are carefully executed to land just past\nfunction hot patch space and prologues, evading user mode trampolines and hooks.\n\nMsnMM, Naikon and Rarstone backdoors were generally delivered with stock 0158 exploits.\nSome dropped iph.bat and an “iExplorer.exe” that began with a “WMcal” parameter and\nprofile.dat executable blob loaded into a running IE process. Other APTs use this kit as well. We\nfound Stone Panda Poison Ivy samples delivered with the same CVE-2012-0158 exploits,\n\n\n-----\n\ndropping iph.bat and iExplorer.exe, and running the “iExplorer.exe WMcal” executable filename\nand parameter.\n\nFinally, we found another exploit builder’s template used to attack Korean-speaking targets. It\nwas used across this group and others for building CVE-2012-0158 files, sharing the common\nauthor “Tran Duy Linh”.\n\n**Shared Strings, Functionality, Targets, and Infrastructure across Campaigns**\n\nMultiple Naikon tools used in multiple campaigns shared strings, functionality, a deployment and\ncontent focus on ASEAN organizations and other organizations doing business with them, and\nthe infrastructure itself. Let’s examine some of the toolset’s shared strings and functionality,\nthen move on to shared infrastructure.\n\n**Similar strings**\n\nWhile the Naikon backdoor maintained the user-agent string “NOKIAN95/WEB”, it also\nmaintained a debug path\nf:\\MyProjects\\xServer\\Release\\xServer.pdb\nAlso, the Naikon backdoor’s matching management software is called “xsControl”. Plugins for\nthe Naikon backdoor included a screenshot grabber named xsAdv.dll, and a single export\n“XS_Screencap”.\n\nThis debug path in Naikon backdoors is very similar to the debug path maintained in Rarstone\nbackdoors:\ng:\\MyProjects\\xsFunction\\Release\\DLL.pdb\n\nThe MsnMM campaign backdoors all maintain an “MM” internal name, and the functionality\nchanges when comparing them:\nWinMM\nWininetMM\nSslMM\nA more recent oddity from this group includes a WinMM dropper with the internal name “Zhixin”,\ncreating a recently compiled Sys10 backdoor.\n\nSome “MM” executables maintained debug strings across versions and families:\nJ:\\chong\\new\\Release\\SslMM.exe\nand\nJ:\\chong\\nod\\Release\\SslMM.exe\n\n**Shared infrastructure**\n\n\n-----\n\nNow, let’s take a look at some of the shared infrastructure that helps to tie all of these\ncampaigns together. MsnMM backdoors and naikon backdoors share portions of infrastructure\nacross campaigns. For a quick example, early msnMM backdoors like sslMM, and one of the\nlater tools, exe_exchange, share some domains with the nokian95 (naikon) and sys10\nbackdoors. There is much crossover:\n\nHere, you can see a table recording domains that are shared across the backdoors for\ncommand and control infrastructure.\n\nexe_exchang sys10 winMM sslMM wininetMM/ xsPlus/naikon\n\ne sakto\n\nahzx.eicp.net yes yes yes\n\nmncgn.51vip. yes yes yes\n\nbiz\n\nbkav.imshop.i yes yes\n\nn\n\nubaoyouxiang yes yes yes yes\n\n.gicp.net\n\ngooglemm.vic yes yes\n\np.net\n\nmyanmartech yes yes yes\n\n.vicp.net\n\n**Correlating Target Profiles with Spearphish and Decoy Content**\n\nOne of the most striking characteristics of this APT is that its targeting interest is revealed by its\nspear-phish and decoy content. Malicious actors of all stripes, including cybercriminals, have for\nat least the last ten years abused “hot topics” in their social-engineering content to better attract\nand mass-exploit victim systems. It’s a pretty worn-out discussion. What is different about the\nNaikon APT’s use of hot topics in spear-phish and decoy content is that reveals its specific\nvictims and how these change over time. Precision social engineering seems to be an elevated\nskill set for the group.\n\nA few of the most interesting examples of such content include: a UN discussion and vote on\nnuclear proliferation and disarmament, the MH370 flight, and construction on the Raytheon-built\nNational Coast Watch Center in PH.\n\nFor example, in the second week of October 2012, during the gang’s intense ongoing focus on\nSE Asian countries like Cambodia and its diplomats, we find a winMM backdoor detected as\n\"Trojan.Win32.Agent.udtc\" in New York City. This verdictidentified the Naikon APT’s backdoor\n\n|Col1|exe_exchang e|sys10|winMM|sslMM|wininetMM/ sakto|xsPlus/naikon|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|ahzx.eicp.net|yes|yes|yes||||\n|mncgn.51vip. biz|yes|yes|yes||||\n|bkav.imshop.i n||yes||||yes|\n|ubaoyouxiang .gicp.net|yes|||yes|yes|yes|\n|googlemm.vic p.net|||yes||yes||\n|myanmartech .vicp.net|||yes|yes||yes|\n\n\n-----\n\non the victim system. The timing is uncanny because, in that same week speeches and views\non nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation were presented by SE Asian country delegates to\nthe United Nations in New York City. An example of such a [talk is here; a naikon decoy’s](http://www.un.org/disarmament/special/meetings/firstcommittee/67/pdfs/11%20Oct%20GD%20Cambodia.pdf)\ncontent was strikingly similar:\n\nMsnMM campaigns most commonly presented spear-phish exploits targeting CVE-2012-0158.\nA listing of screenshots in Appendix A reveals the variety of content and themes, all related to\nevents and topics in the ASEAN region. Example titles include:\n\n|Letpadaung copper mine.doc|Myanmar Wanbao to commence construction of Letpadaung project|December 2014|\n|---|---|---|\n|nuclear agreement burma.doc|Burma Signs New Nuclear Deal With IAEA|September 2013|\n|ALP Statement on Present Illegal Bangali Problem inside Arakan.doc|ALP statement on present illegal Bangali problems inside Arakan [pdf]|December 2012|\n|Calendar Misslao 2013 Free.doc|Miss Lao Calendars|January 2014|\n|ASEAN and Partners Firmly Committed to Narrowing the Development Gap.doc|ASEAN and Partners Firmly Committed to Narrowing the Development Gap|April 2013|\n|refer to the 11th ACD Ministerial Meeting.doc|Asia Co-operation Dialogue eyes peace|December 2013|\n|Asia’s Military Developments.doc|Asia’s military developments|November 2013|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following example’s content was crafted to appear like a legitimate international agreement\ndiscussion. After the malicious document is opened and successfully exploits CVE-2012-0158\non the victim workstation, the exploit code drops and opens this decoy Word document:\n\nThis next example is written with the Laotian Phetsarath OT font, a decoy attempt to be a\nlegitimate Daily News Brief from the Laotian Foreign Ministry of Affairs. It demonstrates the\ngroup’s intentions to hit targets in Laos:\n\n\n-----\n\nAppendix A contains many more example document titles and screenshots. The themes and\ncontent that would appeal to politically-interested individuals in various parts of the world quickly\nbecome obvious.\n\nIn addition to a high volume of files exploiting CVE-2012-0158, the MsnMM attackers for a brief\nperiod used RTLO (right to left override) techniques, and then attachments exploiting CVE2010-3333. An example of RTLO that creates and opens this decoy document to camouflage its\nmalicious background activity, then dropping and executing MsnMM backdoors on its victim\nsystem:\n\nUNFC_Statement_final_rcs.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n**Naikon APT MsnMM Campaign Backdoors and Lateral Movement Toolset**\n\n**SslMM**\n\n|MD5 – Filename|File Size|Compilation date|Linker version|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|7b1199523a662a3844ba590f83b56dae - %temp%\\conime.exe|77,824 bytes|2013:01:31 01:25:38+00:00|6.0|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe MsnMM gang built and released many more variants of their sslMM creation. The code is a\nfull-featured backdoor. Each variant of this tool starts by attempting to create a socket, and then\ncreates a new thread implementing a fairly complicated keylogging facility not often seen, using\nWindows Keyboard Accelerators. Online code demonstrates the technique here:\nhttp://thronic.com/Win32%20Keylogging/\n\nThe backdoor retrieves a large number of victim system data points, which it then uses to check\nin to its hardcoded C2. The backdoor reports system identification information both to present\nthe victim’s identifying information and to fingerprint the system for asset management:\n\n  - OS version\n\n  - Service pack information\n\n  - Processor speed\n\n  - System name\n\n  - Logged-on user name\n\n  - OS install date\n\nOne of its more interesting features is the ability to fetch and use certificates from the “My” store\non Windows systems. The “My” certificate store is created on a per-user basis, and this is where\nusers’ certificates are stored. It is reserved for each user for signing and decrypting data and\nencrypting network communications.\n\nFeature list:\n\n  - Victim fingerprinting and performance sensitivity - system configuration collection\n\n  - Persistence - immediately identifying the Start Menu Startup directory and dropping a\n\nLNK to its own executable disguised as a “Office Start”, “Yahoo Talk”, “MSN Gaming\nZ0ne”, or “MSN Talk” shortcut\n\n  - Configurable network settings - both a primary and backup C2 string is hard-coded in\n\neach backdoor. At this point, we are aware of almost 50 domains and unique IP\naddresses used to host C2\n\n  - Keylogging facility - Windows Accelerators with hidden window and lengthy Accelerator\n\ntable\n\n  - Flexible network connectivity - proxy support for use with victim systems situated behind\n\nisolated networks\n\n  - GET and POST network code for exfiltrating system information\n\n  - Log file capabilities\n\n  - File search and file write primitives - identifying and collecting sensitive ondisk\n\ninformation\n\n  - Download and execute further arbitrary downloads\n\n  - Arbitrary inter-process launch and communication through named pipes\n\n  - Process privilege and token adjustments\n\n  - Anti-malware kill-process identification and termination\n\n  - Digital Certificate stealing and reuse for stealth SSL communications\n\n  - Network server listener\n\n\n-----\n\n**WinMM**\n\n**MD5 - Filename** **File Size** **Compilation date** **Linker**\n**version**\n\nc8c81cca4645e71213f2310cec6c277d - 118,784 2012.11.01 6.0\n%temp%\\wuauc1t.exe bytes 00:53:49\n\nWinMM is a full-featured, simple backdoor. Its first actions upon installation are to collect user\nand system data and report them back to the C2 over http. It uses NetUserGetInfo to identify\nthat it is running under an “Admin” account on the local system, then retrieves the system name\nand the version of the operating system that is running, including its service pack, and collects\nthe system install date from the registry:\n\\\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\InstallDate.\nThese values are built into a single string for reporting.\n\nSslMM also maintains this code chunk and functionality but does not immediately invoke it like\nwinMM. Also interesting and different from sslMM, are the decoy Word documents dropped by\nmany of the winMM droppers. Images of these documents are shown in the Appendix. The\ndocuments are all written and formatted with a specially developed Myanmar2 True Type font,\ndemonstrating the focus on politically-connected, native Myanmar speakers as targets. This font\nis not delivered by default with Microsoft Office. Instead, it must have been specifically installed\nby the attackers and then by the victims, otherwise the documents would not have displayed\nproperly.\n\nThe backdoor maintains multiple primitive functionalities:\nSetting a WH_CBT Windows hook for full activity spying (sslMM does not maintain this hooking\nfunctionality):\n\n  - File search and capture\n\n  - Process creation\n\n  - Keystroke capture\n\nThe backdoor is usually configured with primary and backup domains for C2 communications,\nalthough there are multiple known samples that maintain an IP address or only a single domain\nfor communications with no backup. Communication is built to appear as though a web browser\nis simply making a request to a remote web server. Some of these backdoors are configured to\nuse an unusual port for encrypted communications.\n\n**exe_exchange (used in attacks prior to ~2012)**\n\n|MD5 - Filename|File Size|Compilation date|Linker version|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|c8c81cca4645e71213f2310cec6c277d - %temp%\\wuauc1t.exe|118,784 bytes|2012.11.01 00:53:49|6.0|\n\n\n-----\n\n|MD5 – Filename|File Size|Compilation date|Linker version|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|6a82c153bd370250cc2fed89f1bb5c91 - %temp%\\services.exe|69,632 bytes|2012-03-13 07:54:19|6.0|\n\n\n**INJECTv1/INJECTRESOURCE**\n\n**MD5 – Filename** **File Size** **Compilation date** **Linker**\n**version**\n\nb295274423c91ad9e254475bf8edd459 159,744 May 27, 2013\n\n- wmiprive.exe bytes\n\n**The xsPlus/nokian backdoor and keylogger**\n\n**MD5 – Filename** **File Size** **Compilation date** **Linker**\n**version**\n\nd86106faaa398b8d83437176bf5e39c4 281,624 2011.12.19 6.0\nbytes 08:06:30\n\nIn 2014 the Naikon gang was found to be using another tool that maintains an internal name\n“xsPlus” and “xsControl”. This builder and its backdoors produce components with the\n“NOKIAN95/WEBx” user-agent strings, for which there are multiple versions. Its functionality is\ncovered in our previous Naikon APT post.\n\n**Naikon and minor links with APT30**\n\nAnother interesting aspect of the backdoor builder is that it also provides a keylogger plugin that\nis used on specific victim systems. And here there are minor, but striking, similarities with the\nAPT30 tools.\n\nCallback sessions for stolen data include these URLs:\n```\n   POST /stonehoof.rar/user=xxx&password=xxx\n   GET /stonehoof.rar/user=xxx&password=xxx\n\n```\n|MD5 – Filename|File Size|Compilation date|Linker version|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|b295274423c91ad9e254475bf8edd459 - wmiprive.exe|159,744 bytes|May 27, 2013||\n\n|MD5 – Filename|File Size|Compilation date|Linker version|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|d86106faaa398b8d83437176bf5e39c4|281,624 bytes|2011.12.19 08:06:30|6.0|\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the collector components upload data in SQLite3 format, while earlier versions of the\ntool upload xml formatted data. Presenting a similarity with the APT30 artifacts, their callback\ndomains included stonehoof.com, hosted on several IPs during the naikon campaigns. This\nname is very unusual, and it is an odd coincidence that it is shared by two geopolitically-focused\ncyber-espionage groups, both targeting the South China Sea region.\n\nAPT30 - stonehoof.com\n2012-10-07 208.77.46.251 174.36.159.165\n2013-04-03 174.36.159.165 219.90.115.251\n2013-04-14 219.90.115.251 174.36.159.164\n\nWhile the MsnMM components include the unusual “MM” in internal names sslMM, winMM, and\nwininetMM, some of the strings in the APT30 GEMSTONE software include the same – search\nand retrieval of the registry key “Software\\Microsoft\\GetMM”, and three function names\n“MicrosoftGMMExit, MicrosoftGMMHaveExit, MicrosoftGMMZJ”. The APT30 BACKSPACE\nbackdoor also contains a similar potential target reference, as discussed in the FireEye paper.\n“BACKSPACE Variant Path Possible Target\nZJ Auto (version 1.4) /autoMM/ Myanmar”\n\nSo, the “MM” shared by both of these may be a simple reference to Myanmar, the starting target\nfor these Naikon APT attacks.\n\nAPT30 backdoors also add “MSN.lnk” shortcuts to the Start Menu Startup location for\npersistence, just like the MsnMM components spoof “Msn Gaming Zone.lnk” and “Msn Talk.lnk”\nfor persistence.\n\n**Sys10**\n\n**MD5 - Filename** **File Size** **Compilation date** **Linker**\n**version**\n\nc58df5892700ac3f467524f86bf325c0 - 116.5 kb 2013.02.01 9.0\nupdate.exe 07:39:12\n\nYet another backdoor was used throughout 2013 by Naikon. Several of the C2 domains are\nshared with either Naikon or MsnMM infrastructure. This backdoor is a very basic initial\ncomponent. To give an idea of the sophistication of its development, one of the decryption\nschemes it uses is an xor 0x1 loop on the very beginning of its .data section to decrypt its C2\ndomain. In this case, 6C 6C 6A 62 66 2F 74 68 62 71 2F 6F 64 75 01 (lljbf/thbq/odu) →\nmmkcg.uicp.net.\n\n|MD5 - Filename|File Size|Compilation date|Linker version|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|c58df5892700ac3f467524f86bf325c0 - update.exe|116.5 kb|2013.02.01 07:39:12|9.0|\n\n\n-----\n\nThis weak level of encryption is odd, because other strings, like the unicode version of the\ncallback url “s.y.s.t.e.n.&.c.p.=.%.s.&.l.o.g.=.%.s.&.i.n.d.e.x.=.%.d.”, are maintained in plaintext\nin the .rdata section. Perhaps the authors thought xor’ing the domains would hide their\ninfrastructure for as long as needed, or they were working with others who didn’t understand\nautomated sandboxes and tracing but didn’t want the dns strings present in the binary. It doesn’t\nseem to make sense, but it appears to have been effective enough to leave in the executables.\n\nFor all of the “Sys10” backdoors, URL parameters were used consistently for the initial C2\ncallback: systen&cp=&log=&index=\nwhere:\n**cp = system computername**\n**log = signed decimal integer representation of the OS InstallDate**\n**index = simply the return value from a GetTickCount call**\n\nThe backdoor collects several bits of identifying information to send to the C2:\n\n  - computer name\n\n  - account name of logged-in user\n\n  - group name of logged-in user\n\n  - local IP address\n\n  - OS versioning information\n\n  - OS install date\n\nThe backdoor maintains a simple set of primitives:\n\n  - http-based communications with hardcoded C2\n\n  - download additional components\n\n  - start a new process\n\n  - terminate a running process\n\n  - find files and copy them\n\n  - delete files\n\n  - create files\n\nWe detected this backdoor on multiple victim workstations with the following verdicts:\n\nTrojan.Win32.Agentb.hyb\nTrojan.Win32.Agentb.iqj\nBackdoor.Win32.MsnMM.p\nUDS:DangerousObject.Multi.Generic\nTrojan.Win32.Agentb.jwp\n\nAccording to KSN (Kaspersky Security Network) data, almost all of the victims attacked with this\nbackdoor are based in Myanmar, or were Myanmar delegates travelling through the other\ncountries like the US, for example.

It created or\nused c:\\intel on the victim hard disk to unpack tools and compress/archive stolen victim files and\ndata with Winrar, like \"c:\\intel\\1.rar\". Some of these victim systems were occupied by both the\nCycldec and Naikon attackers.\n\nThe Cycldek attackers maintained this c:\\intel directory and its subdirectories as a sort of\nstaging point. This mirrors what we have seen with Naikon directory setup on some victims.\n\n  - a set of subdirectories\n\n  - stolen files for exfiltration\n\n  - operational logs\n\n  - process logs\n\n  - Cycldek tools and their config files\n\nThe Naikon APT and Cycldek APT also share a common attraction to Honker Union codebase.\n\n**Spear-phish, dropped files, web browser injection**\n\nThe common sequence of events on a vulnerable system falling for related spear-phish attacks\nled to a newly-created Internet Explorer process running with execution transferred to\nadditionally loaded executable code, usually profile.dat, maintaining the connectback C2\ncommunication code and data.\n\nIn this instance, a “naikon backdoor” was delivered initially as a part of a small package of\nobjects. The exploit attachment dropped iph.bat, iExplorer.exe, and a clean decoy document.\nThe exploit executed this batch file, which in turn executed iExplorer.exe and opened a decoy\ndocument from %temp%. The iExplorer.exe process wrote out a profile.dat file, launched the\nlegitimate Internet Explorer, and injected the .dat file into this newly created browser process. It\ntransfered control to the injected .dat code and terminated itself. The .dat code then connected\nwith a hardcoded C2 from within Internet Explorer, a common technique for evading any\n\n\n-----\n\noutbound traffic firewall issues.\n\nThe full email spear-phish and other decoy documents’ content presented here display the\ncampaigns’ focus on ASEAN targets that line up with the MsnMM campaigns:\n\nExample spear-phish and dropped sequence for NOKIAN95/WEB sent to web email service\nprovider users in the US and Southeastern Asian region:\n\nExample Word document decoy\n\nExample details, exhibiting the “common” sequence of events on systems:\n\nc334737ea5e8f74567bfdc2fce6717b9,2 SpecialServices.doc\nDrops → %temp%\\iph.bat\n\nc8ed40879e1e3352692fe8c765294955,%temp%\\svchost.exe\nc8ed40879e1e3352692fe8c765294955,C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\ymsgr_tray.exe\nc2: frankhere.oicp.net:443\n\n1b37457632840b04bf03e0745e51e573,readme.rtf\nDrops → %temp%\\iph.bat → %temp%\\iExplorer.exe WMcal\n6cbc73fae7118dbd0fae328ce8ee6050,iExplorer.exe,Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Cordmix.cu\nC2: phsenator.vicp.net\nC2: goihang.vicp.net:443\n\n\n-----\n\nExample decoy Word document\n\ncb72e70378755f1e8ab744a5b5e692bd,Asia’s Military Developments.doc (ripped from\n“Australian Strategic Policy Institute” blog post located here http://www.aspistrategist.org.au/asias-military-developments/)\n\n638c119a82a1b1d470e42e2e9712f3fb,iph.bat\n79de618615e139053ad92ca1e7bb7456,C:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Local\nSettings\\Temp\\mshtml.dat\n\n4299846c34fddda2f5a75239f8aca424,C:\\DOCUME~1\\user\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\upd.exe Rpcss\na3b3a32b6f67e4629133cc4578230efe,C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\msictl.exe\n\nc2: us.googlereader.pw:443\n\n\n-----\n\nExample decoy pdf targeting Myanmar government\n\n5f1f6fb3cea3e9c3bd84909b7d37aa8d, ”knu president speech on 65th anniversary of karen\nresistance day _burmese language_?fdp.scr” ← indicates RTLO naming, appeared to the\ntarget as pdf “knu president speech on 65th anniversary of karen resistance day _burmese\nlanguage_rcs.pdf”\n\n55b8b8779001b7e78a6adc55fb546401,C:\\DOCUME~1\\user\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\update.exe\n8660193a90e70f19a4419ae09306761f,C:\\DOCUME~1\\user\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\adobe.pdf\n\nC2: ubaoyouxiang.gicp.net\n\n\n-----\n\nExample decoy Word document targeting PH gov\n\n27ed7c7dd840ff7936418cf029d56603, AFP Summary.doc  %temp%\\iph.bat\n\nceb6e4499cfd8650f3e94fbcf7de48f6,%temp%\\iExplorer.exe WMcal\nb6424852dd0187ea554a1cbc4e3490f3,%temp%\\profile.dat\n\nC2: ttteco.vicp.net\n\n\n-----\n\nMany of these backdoors were delivered by simply binding decoy pdfs to a Naikon backdoor\nand sending this bundle to target addresses.
