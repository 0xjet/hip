This report details a\ncomprehensive strategic framework for tackling the dramatically increasing and evolving threat of\nransomware, a widespread form of cybercrime that in just a few years has become a serious national\nsecurity threat and a public health and safety concern.\n\nRansomware is not just financial extortion; it is a crime that transcends business, government,\nacademic, and geographic boundaries. It has disproportionately impacted the healthcare industry\nduring the COVID pandemic, and has shut down schools, hospitals, police stations, city governments,\nand U.S. military facilities. It is also a crime that funnels both private funds and tax dollars toward\nglobal criminal organizations. The proceeds stolen from victims may be financing illicit activities\nranging from human trafficking to the development and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nTackling ransomware will not be easy; there is no silver bullet for solving this challenge. Most\nransomware criminals are based in nation-states that are unwilling or unable to prosecute this\ncybercrime, and because ransoms are paid through cryptocurrency, they are difficult to trace.\nThis global challenge demands an “all hands on deck” approach, with support from the highest\nlevels of government.\n\nCountless people around the world are already working tirelessly to blunt the onslaught of\nransomware attacks. But no single entity alone has the requisite resources, skills, capabilities,\nor authorities to significantly constrain this global criminal enterprise.\n\nFor this reason, we convened the Ransomware Task Force — a team of more than 60 experts\nfrom software companies, cybersecurity vendors, government agencies, non-profits, and academic\ninstitutions — to develop a comprehensive framework for tackling the ransomware threat.\n\nOur goal is not only to help the world better understand ransomware, but to proactively and\nrelentlessly disrupt the ransomware business model through a series of coordinated actions,\nmany of which can be immediately implemented by industry, government, and civil society. Acting\nupon a few of these recommendations will not likely shift the trajectory, but the Task Force is\nconfident that implementing all of them in coordination, with speed and conviction, will make a\nsignificant difference.\n\nWhile we have strived to be comprehensive, we acknowledge there will be areas we have not\naddressed, or on which we could not come to consensus. Prohibition of payments is the most\nprominent example; the Task Force agreed that paying ransoms is detrimental in a number of ways,\nbut also recognized the challenges inherent in barring payments. Just as we have been grateful to\nstand on the shoulders of those that came before us, we hope our efforts and investigations will fuel\nthe thinking and recommendations of those that come after us.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe urge all those with the ability to act to do so immediately. The ransomware threat continues to\nworsen by the day, and the consequences of waiting to respond could be disastrous. More than\nmoney is at stake; lives, critical infrastructure, public faith in the legitimacy of our institutions, the\neducation system, and in many ways, our very way of life depends on taking action.\n\nAs a final note, we would like to offer our sincere thanks to the members of the Ransomware Task\nForce, who responded to our call and generously dedicated their time and energy into developing the\nrecommendations included in this report.\n\n**The Working Group Co-Chairs of the Ransomware Task Force.**\n\n\n###### John Davis,  Palo Alto  Networks\n\n\n###### Megan Stifel,  Global Cyber  Alliance\n\n\n###### Kemba Walden, Microsoft\n\n Philip Reiner,  Institute for Security  and Technology\n\n\n###### Jen Ellis,  Chris Painter,  Rapid7 The Global Forum  on Cyber Expertise Foundation Board\n\n\n###### Michael Phillips,  Resilience\n\n Michael Daniel,  Cyber Threat Alliance\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware attacks present an urgent national security risk around the world. This evolving form\nof cybercrime, through which criminals remotely compromise computer systems and demand a\nransom in return for restoring and/or not exposing data, is economically destructive and leads to\ndangerous real-world consequences that far exceed the costs of the ransom payments alone.\n\nIn 2020, thousands of businesses, hospitals, school districts, city governments, and other institutions\nin the U.S. and around the world were paralyzed as their digital networks were held hostage by\nmalicious actors seeking payouts. The immediate physical and business risks posed by ransomware\nare compounded by the broader societal impact of the billions of dollars steered into criminal\nenterprises, funds that may be used for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, human\ntrafficking, and other virulent global criminal activity.\n\nDespite the gravity of their crimes, the majority of ransomware criminals operate with near-impunity,\nbased out of jurisdictions that are unable or unwilling to bring them to justice. This problem is\nexacerbated by financial systems that enable attackers to receive funds without being traced.\nAdditionally, the barriers to entry into this lucrative criminal enterprise have become shockingly low.\nThe “ransomware as a service” (RaaS) model, allows criminals without technical sophistication to\nconduct ransomware attacks. At the same time, technically knowledgeable criminals are conducting\nincreasingly sophisticated attacks.\n\nSignificant effort has been made to understand and address the ransomware threat, yet attackers\ncontinue to succeed on a broad and troubling scale. To shift these dynamics, the international\ncommunity needs a comprehensive approach that influences the behavior of actors on all sides of\nthe ecosystem, including deterring and disrupting attackers, shoring up preparation and response of\npotential victims, and engaging regulators, law enforcement, and national security experts. We also\nneed international cooperation and adoption of processes, standards, and expectations.\n\nThis report outlines a comprehensive framework of actions (48 in total) that government and industry\nleaders can pursue to significantly disrupt the ransomware business model and mitigate the impact\nof these attacks in the immediate and longer terms. These recommendations were collaboratively\ndeveloped by the Ransomware Task Force (RTF) — a broad coalition of volunteer experts from\nindustry, government, law enforcement, civil society, cybersecurity insurers, and international\norganizations — to provide a strategic framework for a systemic, global approach to mitigating the\nransomware problem.\n\nWhile we have identified some recommendations as priorities, we strongly recommend viewing the\nentire set of recommendations together, as they are designed to complement, and build on each other.\nThe strategic framework is organized around four primary goals: to deter ransomware attacks through\na nationally and internationally coordinated, comprehensive strategy; to disrupt the business model\nand reduce criminal profits; to help organizations prepare for ransomware attacks; and to respond to\nransomware attacks more effectively.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ransomware threat continues to worsen daily. The actions detailed in this report need to be\nenacted together as soon as possible, and must be coordinated at a national and international level\nin order to have the necessary impact. We understand the gravity of this challenge, but we believe\nthat if this framework is implemented in full, the international community could see a decrease in\nthe volume of these types of attacks in one year’s time. Proposing this framework is merely the\nfirst step, and the real challenge is in implementation. With every recommended action we aimed\nto work through the practical implications, and in most cases we present immediately actionable\nrecommendations. The Co-Chairs of the RTF welcome the opportunity to discuss these findings\nand recommendations further to help achieve these goals.\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware is a flourishing criminal industry that not only risks the personal and financial\nsecurity of individuals, but also threatens national security and human life. Businesses, schools,\ngovernments, hospitals, and nearly every other type of institution are regularly targeted, disrupted,\nand held hostage. The problem has steadily grown worse in recent years, and in 2020, nearly\n2,400 U.S.-based governments, healthcare facilities, and schools were victims of ransomware,\naccording to the security firm Emsisoft.[1] Multiple organizations have issued reports on the costs\nof ransomware, and while their exact figures vary, all consistently show a steady increase in the\nnumber of attacks — and damaging economic impact.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Ransomware as a National Security Threat\n\nThe costs of ransomware go far beyond the ransom payments themselves. Cybercrime is typically\nseen as a white-collar crime, but while ransomware is profit-driven and “non-violent” in the\ntraditional sense, that has not stopped ransomware attackers from routinely imperiling lives.\n\n###### Threats to Critical Infrastructure:\nRansomware attacks have shut down the operations of critical national resources, including military\nfacilities. In 2019, a ransomware attack shut down the operations of a U.S. Coast Guard facility for\n30 hours,[6] and in February 2020, a ransomware attack on a natural-gas pipeline operator halted\noperations for two days.[7] Attacks on the energy grid, on a nuclear plant, waste treatment facilities, or\non any number of critical assets could have devastating consequences, including human casualties.\n\n###### Risks to Public Health:\nHospitals and other medical centers are a favorite target for ransomware criminals. In 2020, 560\nhealthcare facilities were hit by ransomware attacks in the U.S. alone.[8] These incidents not only cost\nthe victims millions of dollars in recovery, but they also have led to delays in patient treatment, and\npossibly loss of life. In September 2020, a ransomware attack led to the failure of computer systems\nat Duesseldorf University Clinic, requiring critically ill patients to be relocated to other facilities, and\nin the United States, an attack caused delays in treatment for cancer patients at the University of\nVermont Medical Care and other facilities.[9]\n\n\n###### Societal Impact: Targeting the Health Care Sector\n\nIn October 2020, hackers compromised the computer networks of roughly a dozen medical centers\nacross the United States. These attacks forced the cancelations of surgeries and disruptions in\npatient care; the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVM) was forced to furlough or reassign\nabout 300 employees as the hospital’s networks were taken offline in the midst of the COVID\npandemic, and patients were turned away from scheduled cancer treatments and other medical\nprocedures. The company’s President and COO estimated the attack would cost roughly $64 million\nbefore systems were fully restored.\n\n###### “\u0007It feels like we are all alone and no one understands  how dire this is,”\n\n– UVM Nurse to the New York Times.[10]\n\nExtensive cyber vulnerabilities across the healthcare industry create potentially lucrative targets\nfor malicious ransom-seeking actors, driving the significant increase in attacks against healthcare\nfacilities. Government policy choices regarding ransomware should focus on this critical threat:\nstatistical analysis reveals that ransomware-driven delays in care in these healthcare systems\ninvariably contributes to a loss of life due to the inability of patients to receive timely care.[11] This\nilluminates the risk to human life posed by these attacks – and yet the attackers continue to\nundertake these assaults with near impunity.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Diversion of Vital Public Resources:\nRansomware attacks on municipal governments are common. Such attacks not only divert public\nresources into illicit economies, but the victims incur costs that far exceed the ransoms alone. For\nexample, in 2018, the City of Atlanta paid $50,000 in Bitcoin as ransom, but the total cost of the\nrecovery exceeded $2.6 million, as the city was forced to pay for digital forensics, increased staffing,\ncrisis communications, and other costs.[12] A ransomware attack similarly debilitated the City of\nBaltimore, leading to a range of negative impacts.\n\n###### Loss of Data/Privacy: \nRansomware criminals are increasingly expanding their attacks to include “double extortion,” whereby\nthey first demand ransom to de-encrypt an organization’s data, then threaten to release the data on\nto the internet unless additional ransom is paid. At the start of 2020, only one major ransomware\ngroup exfiltrated data for a second extortion, but by the end of the year, at least 17 other groups used\nthis tactic.[13] The potential exposure of their data and ensuing legal liability (particularly in countries\nwith strict data security laws) may be a critical factor in leading some victims to pay the ransom.\n\n###### Disruption of Schools and Colleges:\nThe education sector has become a top target: during 2020, nearly 1700 schools, colleges, and\nuniversities in the United States were impacted by ransomware.[14] According to a report by the Federal\nBureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the\nMulti-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), 57% of all reported ransomware\nattacks in August and September 2020 were targeted at K–12 schools.[15] These attacks not only\ndisrupt the schools’ operations, but often include threats to leak confidential student data on the\ninternet.\n\n###### Societal Impact: Cities Under Siege\n\nIn May 2019, a ransomware attack on the City of Baltimore took critical services offline. The city\nrefused to pay the ransom, but the recovery lasted several weeks and cost $18.2 million to restore\nsystems back to their original state.[16] Beyond the financial burden on taxpayers and the shutdown of\nservices, the city’s inhabitants were no longer able to pay water bills, property taxes, or parking fines.\nSome residents who could not pay their bills saw their homes go into foreclosure. Databases tracking\nstreet drugs were knocked offline, people were unable to pay water bills and home sales were\ndelayed.[17] The city’s 911 dispatch system was knocked offline, and emergency calls made during that\ntime were not recorded. The criminals threatened to publicly release data stolen during the attack\nto exert pressure on city officials to pay, in an early example of the “double extortion” tactic that has\nsince become prevalent.[18]\n\n###### Economic Impact:\nRansoms paid by private firms siphon millions of dollars toward criminal enterprise every year. The\ntotal amount paid by ransomware victims increased by 311% in 2020, reaching nearly $350 million\nworth of cryptocurrency.[19] However, the economic impacts go well beyond the costs of ransoms\n\n\n-----\n\nalone. Reported ransomware payments do not cover the costs associated with service downtime\nand recovery. Total remediation costs are typically several times a ransom payment and are often\nlarge enough to cripple many small businesses. In addition, money that flows to the criminal\nnetworks creates second- and third-order economic effects, since those revenues go on to fund\nother types of crime.\n\n###### FIGURE 1 Average ransom in USD\n\n250,000\n\n200,000\n\n150,000\n\n100,000\n\n50,000\n\n0\n\n2018 2018 2019 2019 2019 2019 2020 2020 2020 2020\n_Q3_ _Q4_ _Q1_ _Q2_ _Q3_ _Q4_ _Q1_ _Q2_ _Q3_ _Q4_\n\n_From The Coveware Quarterly Ransomware Report_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Understanding Ransomware\n\nRansomware is a sub-category of malware, a class of software designed to cause harm to a\ncomputer or computer network. CISA defines ransomware as “an ever-evolving form of malware\ndesigned to encrypt files on a device, rendering any files and the systems that rely on them unusable.\nMalicious actors then demand ransom in exchange for decryption. Ransomware actors often target\nand threaten to sell or leak exfiltrated data or authentication information if the ransom is not paid.”[24]\n\nRansomware proliferates in diverse ways, including through exploitation of vulnerabilities, as well as\nsocial engineering tactics, such as “phishing” emails that deceive employees within an organization\nto open attachments that launch the malware that then infects their networks. Once launched, the\nmalware may connect to a command-and-control server to enable the criminals to move laterally\nacross networks and encrypt and/or exfiltrate the organization’s data. Ransomware victims are\ntypically prompted with a screen informing them that their data has been encrypted, with instructions\nfor how to restore their systems by sending payment via cryptocurrency. Not all attacks result in\ndata encryption, but most do: a 2020 survey of 5000 IT managers found that 51% had been hit by\nransomware in the last year, and the criminals succeeded in encrypting the data in 73% of these\nattacks, according to Sophos.[25]\n\n###### Example of a ransomware lock screen\n\n_Ransomware victims are typically prompted with a screen informing them that their data has been encrypted,_\n_with instructions for how to restore their systems by sending payment via cryptocurrency._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Ransom Payments\n\nA number of factors can influence whether victims agree to pay the ransom demand, including\nwhether they have cyber insurance, the quality of their data backups, and the estimated costs of the\nsystem outage. Legal considerations may also come into play: in the United States for example, firms\nthat pay ransoms (and their facilitators) may find themselves in violation of regulations imposed by\nthe Office of Foreign Assets Controls (OFAC).[26]\n\nSurveys of global IT professionals have found that, of the organizations reporting a ransomware\nattack, 27% of victims chose to pay the ransom requested, with small variations at the regional level\nin terms of the average amounts paid $1.18 million in APAC, $1.06 million at EMEA, and $0.99 million\nin the United States).[27]\n\nVictims may be more likely to pay if they are concerned their data will be made public. As a result, the\ntheft and threat of public disclosure of sensitive data — a tactic known as “double extortion” or “data\nexfiltration” — has become an increasingly common tactic for ransomware attackers, as it intensifies\nthe pressure on entities already struggling to regain operational capacity and protect sensitive data.\n\n###### FIGURE 2 Percent of attacks involving data exfiltration\n\nPercent of cases without data exfiltration\n\nPercent of cases with data exfiltration A 2020 survey by Sophos of\n\n###### 5000 IT managers found that\n\n100\n\n### 51%\n\n75\n\nhad been hit by ransomware in the last year\n\n50\n\n###### Criminals succeeded in encrypting the data in\n\n25\n\n### 73%\n\n0 of these attacks.\n\n2020 2020 2020 2020\n_Q1_ _Q2_ _Q3_ _Q4_\n\n_From The Coveware Quarterly Ransomware Report_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Cyber Insurance and Ransomware\n\nThe cyber insurance industry sells policies to firms to cover losses in the event of a ransomware attack\nor other incident. Cyber insurance policies often include specific coverages for ransomware, including\nfor business interruption losses, data restoration costs, incident response costs, and for a ransom\npayment, if one is made.\n\nRansomware attacks are the most common reported cyber insurance claim, according to Coalition, a\ncyber insurance firm. In the first half of 2020, Coalition observed a 260% increase in the frequency of\nransomware attacks among its policyholders, with the average ransom demand increasing 47% to an\naverage of $338,669.[28]\n\nThe role of cyber insurance in ransomware is complicated. Some argue that the “backstop” support\nof insurance encourages ransomware attackers, as victims may be more likely to pay if their costs\nare covered.[29] There is evidence that attackers may target companies specifically because they have\ninsurance; in an interview, a ransomware criminal affiliated with the prominent syndicate REvil (also known\nas Sodinokibi) stated that targeting firms with cyber insurance was “one of the tastiest morsels.”[30]\n\nOn the other hand, more mature insurance providers typically require that their clients adhere to strong baseline\nsecurity practices, which can significantly reduce the disruption caused by a ransomware attack. They\nalso connect victims to recovery experts and law enforcement, and can leverage a variety of market tools,\nsuch as co-insurance, to incentivize security standards and discourage organizations from paying ransoms.\n\nThe challenge is that not all cyber insurers are at the same level of sophistication, and some may even\nview a lack of security baseline requirements to be a unique selling proposition. Given the prevalence\nand cost of ransomware claims, it is rational to expect that the cyber insurance industry will eventually\nadopt security baseline requirements broadly as a standard expectation for insurability. When this\nbecomes the status quo, insurers will play a more definitively positive role both in driving adoption of\nbetter cyber hygiene, and in providing an important safety net for victims of attacks. However, it will take\ntime to achieve this maturity across the industry.\n\nAcknowledging the ways in which cyber insurance may influence or shape organizational behavior\nand the ransomware “kill chain”, the insurance-related recommendations in this report are designed to\nenhance the sector’s role in supporting comprehensive public and private action against ransomware,\nwhile accelerating the cyber insurance market’s maturity, solvency, and expertise. For a more detailed\noverview of cyber insurance, see Appendix A.\n\n\nincrease in the frequency of\n\n###### In the\n\nransomware attacks among its\n\n###### first half\n\n##### 260% policyholders,\n\n###### of 2020, Coalition observed a with the average to an average of\n\nransom demand\nincreasing 47% $338,669\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Role of Cryptocurrency\n\nThe explosion of ransomware as a lucrative criminal enterprise has been closely tied to the rise\nof Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which use distributed ledgers, such as blockchain, to track\ntransactions. The use of cryptocurrency adds to the challenge of identifying ransomware criminals,\nas payments with these currencies are difficult to attribute to any individual. Often the money does\nnot flow straight from ransomware victim to criminal; it travels through a multi-step process involving\ndifferent financial entities, many of which are novel and are not yet part of standardized, regulated\nfinancial payments markets.\n\nRansomware criminals typically demand that victims send their ransom payments via Bitcoin,\nbut after receiving the payment in a designated digital “wallet” (software that stores public and\nprivate keys), the criminals typically obfuscate these funds as quickly as possible to avoid detection\nand tracking. Their methods include “chainhopping,” which involves exchanging funds in one\ncryptocurrency for another using any of a variety of cryptocurrency exchanges. The funds can\nbe extremely difficult to trace after they have been exchanged, and to further shield themselves,\nransomware actors may use money-mule service providers to set up accounts, or use accounts with\nfalse or stolen credentials.\n\nRansomware criminals can also obscure their transactions through cryptocurrency “mixing services,”\nwhich muddy the public ledger by mixing in legitimate traffic with illicit ransomware funds. Some\ngroups will also demand payments in currencies known as “privacy coins,” such as Monero, that\nare designed for privacy and make payments untraceable.[31] However, privacy coins have not\nbeen adopted as widely as might be expected because they are not as liquid as Bitcoin and other\ncryptocurrencies, and due in part to regulation, this payment method may become increasingly\nimpractical.\n\nCryptocurrencies add to the challenge of ransomware because they are considered to be\n“borderless.” The cryptocurrency community is expressly focused on building a set of technologies\ndesigned to reduce compliance and financial process costs. After obfuscating the extorted funds,\nransomware criminals may either withdraw the funds into hard cash, or because cryptocurrencies\nhave become increasingly common (and their value has been steadily rising), they may keep their\nprofits in cryptocurrency and use them to pay for other illicit activities.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies are difficult to trace, blockchain analysis can help interpret public blockchain\nledgers and, with the proper tools, government agencies, cryptocurrency businesses, and financial\ninstitutions can understand which real-world entities transact with each other. Blockchain analytic\ncompanies are able to show that a given transaction took place between two different cryptocurrency\nexchanges, for example, or between a cryptocurrency exchange and an illicit entity, such as a\nsanctioned individual or organization. With blockchain analysis tools and Know Your Customer (KYC)\ninformation, law enforcement can gain transparency into blockchain activity in ways that are not\npossible in traditional finance.\n\nSee Appendix B: The Cryptocurrency Payment Process, for a more detailed overview of how\nransomware payments work, including where interventions could occur and how they could\nundermine the ransomware business model.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### A Global Challenge\n\nRansomware is a global challenge, as institutions in all sectors around the world are being\nincreasingly targeted. A single attack can also rapidly spread across borders, intentionally or\notherwise: the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack affected 150 countries.[32] A survey by security\nfirm Sophos[33] found the nations with the highest percentage of organizations reporting ransomware\nattacks in 2020 were India, Brazil, Turkey, Belgium, Sweden, and the United States. However,\nransomware attacks occur frequently in Russia, Saudi Arabia, China, and nearly every other nation.[34]\n\nReducing the ransomware threat will require global cooperation due to the highly decentralized\nnature of cryptocurrency, dispersed nature of the criminal networks involved, the internet’s basic\ninfrastructure, and the differing legal and regulatory regimes around the world. Ransomware\ncriminals are able to game the system by moving their operations to where legislation and cybercrime\nenforcement are the most lenient. International institutions have begun to tackle this challenge: in\nOctober 2020, for example, finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) called upon nations to\nimplement Financial Action Task Force standards to reduce ransomware and other cybercrime.[35]\nHowever, more must be done to improve global cooperation, reduce safe havens, align international\nstandards, and ramp up enforcement.\n\n###### FIGURE 3 2020/21 Confirmed Organization Ransomware Incidents\n\n**United Kingdom**\n\n29+ Events\n**United States**\n370+ Events\n\n**Brazil**\n\n9+ Events\n\n**2020/21 Confirmed Organization**\n\n**Ransomware Incidents**\n\n1 (log scale) 350+\n\n_Sources: Palo Alto Unit 42; Scitum; Cloudian; Black Fog; Recorded Future Incidents include victim organizations with data_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Threat Actors\n\nThe profitability of ransomware has attracted a diverse set of malicious actors, who have built a\nthriving and evolving criminal ecosystem. While different ransomware attacks may seem similar, they\nare often executed by a diverse array of attackers with highly variable motivations. Some are\norganized into ransomware “gangs,” which, like other organized crime units, operate in one cohesive\nteam while developing and executing attacks.\n\nRecent years have seen the rise of the “ransomware as a service” (RaaS) business model. Some\nnational governments have used ransomware to advance their strategic interests, including evading\nsanctions. This diversity of threats increases the complexity of attributing and countering ransomware\nattacks and highlights the need for broad pressure along the entire ransomware kill chain.\n\n###### FIGURE 4 Ransomware “Kill Chain”\n\n PRE-EXPLOIT POST-EXPLOIT\n\nRecon Dev/Test Sales/ Infrastructure Initital Ransomware Recovery\nResales Setup & Ops access Live\n\n###### PRE-EVENT EVENT POST-EVENT\n\n_Source: World Economic Forum’s Partnership against Cybercrime in collaboration with Accenture_\n\n###### Ransomware-as-a-Service\n\nCarrying out a ransomware attack does not require technical sophistication. “Ransomware as a\nservice” (RaaS) is a business model that provides ransomware capabilities to would-be criminals\nwho do not have the skills or resources to develop their own malware. In 2020, two-thirds of the\nransomware attacks analyzed by cybersecurity firm Group-IB were perpetrated by cyber criminals using\na RaaS model.[36] This “as a service” model follows similar evolutions in the mainstream software and\ninfrastructure industries, which have seen success from “software as a service” and “infrastructure as a\nservice” business models.\n\nIn the RaaS model, there are at least two parties who establish a business relationship: the developer and\nthe affiliate. The developer writes the malicious program that encrypts and potentially steals the victim’s\ndata. The developer then licenses this malware to the affiliate for a fixed fee or a share of successful\nransom payments. The affiliate executes the attack and collects the ransom, potentially also including\nadditional business arrangements, like purchasing exploits or using cryptocurrency brokers and washers.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this model, even a non-technical affiliate can successfully execute ransomware attacks by purchasing\nthe necessary exploits and malware. RaaS can be contrasted with more traditional ransomware gangs,\nin which a cohesive team both builds the malware and executes the attack. The Sobinokibi, Phos,\nDharma, and GlobeImposter ransomware variants are all known to operate under the RaaS model.[37]\n\n###### The Nation-State Nexus\nOf particular interest to the Task Force was the relationship between ransomware and national\ngovernments. Many ransomware criminals operate with impunity, as their countries’ governments\nare unwilling or unable to prosecute this form of crime. In other cases, the organizations executing\nransomware attacks may be state-sponsored, and may in fact be helping nations evade economic\nsanctions.[38] For example, in an April 2021 announcement of new sanctions against Russia, the U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury made a direct connection between Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB)\nand ransomware hackers, noting that “to bolster its malicious cyber operations, the FSB cultivates\nand co-opts criminal hackers, including the previously designated Evil Corp, enabling them to engage\nin disruptive ransomware attacks and phishing campaigns.”[39]\n\nProceeds from ransomware may help finance terrorism, human trafficking, or the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction.[40] For these reasons, direct affiliation between ransomware attacks and\ngovernments is intentionally shrouded in secrecy, making attribution and accountability challenging.\nCountering state-sponsored attackers will require broad application of “carrot and stick” methods and\ninternational cooperation.\n\n\n###### Societal Impact: NotPetya\n\nThe 2017 NotPetya attack highlighted how this form of cybercrime can have far-reaching\nconsequences. The estimated financial losses exceeded $10 billion, but the true scale of the damage\nwas far greater. Though the attack was not strictly ransomware as it was not motivated by profit,\nit did leverage ransomware code, cause the same type of disruptive impact, and present a screen\ndemanding a ransom.\n\nThe attack started in Ukraine, where computer systems at two major airports, bus stations, railways,\nthe postal service, and media companies were taken hostage. It infected ATM machines and\npayment systems, and for the first time after 31 years, the radiation monitors at Chernobyl shut\ndown, forcing workers in hazmat suits to manually monitor radiation levels.[41]\n\nThe destructive virus was designed to spread, and soon shut down factories in locations as far away\nas Tasmania. NotPetya affected Merck’s production of critical vaccines, and the company had to dip\ninto emergency stockpiles to meet demand. Doctors in Virginia and Pennsylvania were locked out of\npatient records and prescription systems.\n\nTwo years after the attack, railway and shipping systems in Ukraine still were not working at full\ncapacity. Packages that had been lost due to ransomware were still not found, and senior citizens\ncontinued to miss pension payments as their records had been lost.\n\nNotPetya was a stark example of how ransomware attacks can affect the very functioning of a\nsociety, and erode the trust that citizens hold in public institutions.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Existing Efforts to Mitigate Ransomware Attacks\n\nRansomware is not a new problem. As attacks have increased in prevalence and impact, significant\neffort has gone into understanding and addressing the array of associated issues. This includes the\ndevelopment of technical tools, critical research on attacker groups and trends, best practice guides\nfor preparation, established threat intel sharing programs, and attack nullification efforts.\n\nThe security field has well-known, pre-existing resources for cyber hygiene,[42] staff training,[43] and\nsecuring resources.[44] Cybersecurity firms can provide network monitoring, anomaly detection,\nand containment. Incident response teams have been established across government,[45] industry,\nand nonprofits, and at a systemic level, federal funding, information sharing, and public-private\npartnerships have been proposed to improve cyber response across organizations.[46]\n\nYet adoption of preparedness best practices remains limited, and ransomware attackers continue\nto find sectors and elements of society that are woefully underprepared for this style of attack. The\nsheer volume of content published on the topic of ransomware is part of the challenge; with so\nmuch information and noise surrounding this threat, time- and resource-constrained organizations\nand individuals struggle to identify the most relevant and accurate sources of useful information. In\naddition, many guides are reportedly either too simple, too complicated and overwhelming, or not\nspecific to ransomware. Operational security and IT staff represented in the Task Force reported that\nit is a struggle to find guidance that is truly actionable and feels relevant to their needs.\n\nSignificant effort remains to address the increasing risks posed by ransomware attacks. The\nsheer volume of attacks hitting such a broad range of sectors leaves even private sector security\ncompanies often lacking the capacity to respond to the number of requests for assistance. In\nresponse, federal governments have taken steps to coordinate information sharing and raise\nawareness around the risks posed by ransomware: for example, in January 2021, CISA unveiled the\nReduce the Risk of Ransomware Campaign to encourage public- and private-sector organizations\nto implement best practices, tools, and resources that can help them mitigate ransomware risk.[47]\nThe U.S. The Dutch National Police, Europol, McAfee, and Kaspersky Lab founded an initiative called\n“No More Ransom”, which provides decryption keys, information on ransomware, and preventative\nadvice, and has done so for years.[48] The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre also provides useful\ninformation and guidelines on how to mitigate ransomware.[49] Coordinated global law enforcement\nactions have led to isolated successes; in January 2021, for example, a coordinated effort led to the\ndisruption of the EMOTET botnet, a major component of ransomware criminals’ infrastructure.[50]\n\nDespite these efforts, ransomware attacks have continued to grow almost unabated, and the\ncriminals behind them continue to operate with near impunity. What began as a relatively minor\nnuisance to people and business is now causing losses in the billions of dollars, and attackers have\ncontinued to target critical public facilities like schools and hospitals. Solutions have been deployed\nin an uncoordinated, disjointed manner, with different sectors working on siloed solutions. The\nransomware threat cannot be stopped via piecemeal solutions; it needs the dedicated, coordinated\nattention of experts, from policymakers to security engineers to industry leaders.\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware has become too large of a threat for any one entity to address; the scale and magnitude\nof this challenge urgently demands coordinated global action. In response, in early 2021, the Institute\nfor Security and Technology (IST) convened the Ransomware Task Force (RTF), an interdisciplinary\ngroup of leaders, for a three-month sprint with the goal of producing a comprehensive framework\nof actionable solutions and recommendations to help public- and private-sector leaders reduce the\nthreats posed by ransomware in the near and long term.\n\nThis strategic framework aims to help policymakers and industry leaders take system-level action —\nthrough potential legislation, funding new programs, or launching new industry-level collaborations —\nthat will help the international community build resistance, disrupt the ransomware business model,\nand develop resilience to the ransomware threat.\n\nThe framework is organized around four goals: deter ransomware attacks through a nationally\nand internationally coordinated, comprehensive strategy; disrupt the ransomware business model\nand reduce criminal profits; help organizations prepare for ransomware attacks; and respond to\nransomware attacks more effectively.\n\nThese goals are interlocking and mutually reinforcing. For example, actions to disrupt the\nransomware payments system will decrease the profitability of ransomware, thereby helping to\ndeter other actors from engaging in this crime. Conversely, without taking the recommended steps\nto deter ransomware attackers, disruption will be harder to achieve. In a similar vein, many actions\ntaken to better prepare organizations for ransomware attacks, such as informing them about the\nrisks, will also improve their ability to respond, while understanding more about how organizations\nare responding to ransomware attacks will help improve organizations’ collective preparedness.\nThus, this framework should be considered as a whole, not merely a laundry list of potential\ndisparate actions.\n\n\n###### Recommendations at a glance:\n\n\n###### 1. \u0007Deter  Ransomware Attacks\n\n\n###### 2. \u0007Disrupt the ransomware business model\n\n\n###### 3. \u0007Help  organizations prepare\n\n\n###### 4. \u0007Respond to ransomware attacks  more effectively\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### Goal #1\n\n Deter ransomware attacks through a  nationally and internationally coordinated, comprehensive strategy\n\n The number of actors capable of conducting ransomware attacks is large and growing, and to curb the growth of this threat in the long-term, steps must be taken to systemically discourage ransomware attacks. This deterrence must be multilayered and rely on all instruments of national power. We propose a coordinated, effectively messaged, relentlessly executed deterrence campaign directed from the senior-most levels of the U.S. Government in real-time collaboration with international partners. The actions recommended here are to be directly supplemented by the disruption activities recommended in Goal #2.\n\n\n###### Objective 1.1:  Signal that ransomware is an international diplomatic and enforcement priority\n\n\n###### International governments must cooperate more purposefully and publicly to send an effective signal to ransomware criminals that this form of cybercrime is a diplomatic and law enforcement priority. A clear declarative policy will serve as a foundation to other international and national-level efforts.\n\n Action 1.1.1: Issue declarative policy through coordinated international diplomatic statements  that ransomware is an enforcement priority.\n\nUsing existing high-level forums (such as the G7, G7 Finance Ministers, G20, Interpol, Europol, and others[51]),\nsenior-level officials and ministers from major nations should agree to one or more joint declarations condemning\nransomware as a national security concern and/or a threat to critical infrastructure, and commit to pursue\nransomware actors. There are several international[52] precedents[53] for this declarative policy. This declaration\nshould outline the steps signatories will mutually agree to take, and include an agreement for each nation to create\na domestic action plan.\n\n\n**Timing: Begin immediately to lay the groundwork; declarations would be issued when the groups meet.**\n**Lead: State Department, National Security Council (NSC), Treasury, Department of Homeland Security (DHS),**\n_and Department of Justice, in coordination with international partners._\n\n\n###### Action 1.1.2: Establish an international coalition to combat ransomware criminals.\n\n\nA standing international coalition composed of representatives from key nations is necessary as a conduit\nfor sharing information and other resources related to the ransomware threat. Such a coalition should include\nrepresentatives from law enforcement using successful models like Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action\nTaskforce,[54] but also including the intelligence community, and private industry. It should carry out key shared\n\n\n-----\n\ntasks, such as building a legal case against criminal actors, pursuing targets/groups through pooling resources\nand tools, and amplifying takedowns when they happen. This effort would directly coincide with those detailed in\n1.1.1 and 1.1.3, but also throughout the actions recommended under Goal #2.\n\n\n**Timing: 3-6 months.** **Lead: White House, in coordination with international partners.**\n\n\nThe U.S. Government should lead the development of a network of ransomware investigative hubs across the\nglobe, including by leveraging cyber assistant legal attachés (ALATs) and International Computer Hacking and\nIntellectual Property (ICHIP) lawyers. The groups within this “team of teams” should be nimble and have access\nto specialists in each of the kill chain areas of the ransomware criminal organizations. The hubs should ensure\ntheir investigative priorities and resources are aligned and coordinated. They should foster a culture of information\nsharing, be located in diverse geopolitical regions to enable swift sharing of intelligence, and contribute directly to\nthe coalition recommended above in Action 1.1.2, but also to the actions recommended below in Objective 1.2 and\nmany of the actions under Goal #2.\n\n\n**Timing: 9-12 months.** **Lead: \u0007State Department, Department of Justice, and international equivalents.**\n\n\nAny international effort will need to include coordinated public communications by national leaders to keep\nthe spotlight on combating ransomware as a priority and ensure the success of the broader effort. These\ncommunications can take the form of speeches, op-eds, news articles, videos, and other media that draw\nattention to ransomware as a problem, promote prevention, and highlight enforcement successes.\n\n\n**Timing: Begin immediately to lay the groundwork; declarations must be issued on an ongoing basis.**\n**Lead: White House, in coordination with international partners.**\n\n\n###### Objective 1.2:  Advance a comprehensive, whole-of-U.S. government strategy for reducing ransomware attacks, led by the White House\n\n\n###### Ransomware is an urgent threat that demands a “whole-of-government” strategic response. Within the U.S. Government, establishing structures for cross-agency coordination will be vital for tackling the ransomware challenge, and will reduce the lag time in government response. Leading new joint efforts with industry will also be crucial: no single actor is fully capable of disrupting this threat by themselves, so we must come together to assess the threat and coordinate activities across authorities and capabilities. Although this recommendation is U.S.-focused, a similar approach should be adopted by other national governments. Additionally, since ransomware is a cross-border issue, it will be vital for governments to reach out to and work with international partners both on a policy and operational level\n\n\n-----\n\nTo ensure this challenge receives sufficient investment of time and resources from the highest levels of the\nU.S. federal government, the White House should establish an Interagency Working Group (IWG) dedicated to\nunderstanding and addressing the ransomware threat at a systemic level, and on an ongoing basis. Doing so will\nsignal to ransomware actors and international partners that this issue rises above other pressing cybersecurity\npriorities. Ideally led through the National Security Council (NSC) in coordination with the new National Cyber\nDirector (NCD), the Ransomware IWG will serve as a high-level strategic forum for coordinating expertise, shaping\npolicy, sharing information, and directing action for all stakeholders.\n\nThe Ransomware IWG will also help ensure that intragovernmental conflicts can be escalated efficiently through\nthe White House policy-coordination and national security decision-making process. The IWG should provide\npolicy direction and leadership for all U.S. Government actions related to ransomware, which will improve\naccountability and help ensure that agencies work together on signaling and deterrence. In addition, the NSC/NCD,\nState Department, DHS, DOJ, Treasury, and other relevant members of the IWG should engage international allies\nand partners to build a like-minded coalition against ransomware and ensure policy coordination, as called for in\nAction 1.1.2.\n\n\n**Timing: Immediate.** **Lead: White House and international equivalents.**\n\n\nThe Interagency Working Group (IWG) described in Action 1.2.1 should direct and oversee the creation of an\ninternal U.S. government Joint Ransomware Task Force (JRTF), whose objective is to coordinate an ongoing,\nnationwide campaign against ransomware, and identify and pursue opportunities for international cooperation.\nThe JRTF’s primary function is to identify targets for disruption and takedown, and clearly designate roles and\nresponsibilities for each. The U.S. government needs this formal interagency structure to avoid uncoordinated\nactivity and to break down the stovepipe structure. The JRTF must be empowered to leverage all tools of national\npower and should prioritize ransomware threats to critical infrastructure. The JRTF should increase the pace and\nefficacy of intelligence-driven ransomware infrastructure takedowns, disruptions of ransomware operations, and\narrest and prosecution of the people that enable them. A detailed breakdown of a potential structure, roles, and\nresponsibilities for the JRTF are provided in Appendix C.\n\nThe JRTF should collaborate closely with relevant private-sector organizations that can help defend against and\ndisrupt ransomware operations, such as security vendors, platform providers, telecommunications providers,\ninformation sharing organizations, cybersecurity non-profits, and other capable entities. These private-sector\nactivities and groupings can continue to operate on an informal and ad hoc basis through the establishment of a\nRansomware Threat Focus Hub (RTFH), which can serve as a central, organizing node for informal networks and\ncollaboration as part of a collaborative, sustained public-private anti-ransomware campaign. The structure, roles,\nand responsibilities of the RTFH are also provided in Appendix C.\n\n\n**Timing: Immediate.** **Lead: \u0007White House, via the direction of the IWG, in coordination with private industry,**\n_and international equivalents._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe JRTF should use all tools of national power to sustain an intelligence-driven anti-ransomware campaign\nthat includes target identification, threat hunting, action planning, execution, and communications. The roles and\nresponsibilities covered within the JRTF should include, but not be limited to: law enforcement action, diplomatic\nefforts, economic tools, technical cyber operations, and intelligence operations as appropriate. The campaign and\ncapabilities utilized should be tailored to target specific vulnerabilities in ransomware groups and their operations\nas identified in the intelligence assessments recommended in Actions 1.2.5 and 1.2.6. Coordination of operations,\nand intelligence sharing that supports those operations, should be streamlined with exceptions to policy as\nneeded to be most effective in targeting groups on the designated list. This should include sharing and operational\ncoordination with U.S. government entities, private industry (e.g. cybersecurity companies, service providers, and\ntrust groups), and a coalition of international partners.\n\nThe JRTF should enhance operational coordination with their international counterparts to conduct more,\nand more effective, international investigations and take-downs. This would be directly facilitated through the\ninvestigative hubs recommended in Action 1.1.3. The JRTF should, to the greatest extent possible, operate at the\nunclassified level, which is essential to enable flexibility, quick reaction times, and the incorporation of essential\npartners who are not JRTF members. To make this possible, the U.S. government should follow the lead of its\ncounterparts in the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Center and dramatically increase the volume of TS/\nSCI information made available at the unclassified level, with a singular focus on the ransomware threat.\n\nThe JRTF can ensure agreements are in place with designated private-sector partners to allow for field level\ncoordination, and must coordinate early and frequently with all relevant elements of U.S. departments and\nagencies, for instance, the NCIJTF and select U.S. Attorney Offices.\n\nVia the private-industry Ransomware Threat Focus Hub (RTFH), as detailed in Appendix C, non-government\nparticipants in these campaigns could include infrastructure providers, platform/OS providers, registrars, endpoint\nsecurity companies, threat intelligence firms, content delivery networks (CDNs), network operators, non-profits,\nand industry nodes. Engagement, planning, and execution should not be limited to regularly scheduled meetings;\nrather, the structure should allow for continuous, responsive, and ad hoc coordination and execution based on\nconstantly changing events.\n\n\n**Timing: 3-6 months.** **Lead: \u0007White House, via the direction of the IWG in Action 1.2.1, in coordination with**\n_private industry, and international equivalents._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### FIGURE 5 Proposed Framework for a Public-Private Operational Ransomware Campaign\n\n**Ransomware Interagency**\n**Working Group (IWG)**\n\n**Action 1.2.1**\n**NSC/NCD-led**\n\n**Joint Ransomware** **Ransomware**\n**Task Force (JRTF)** **Threat Focus Hub**\n\n**Action 1.2.2** **Action 1.2.2**\n**Interagency Operational Level** **Private Sector Facilitator**\n\n**USG Departments** **Existing**\n**and Agencies** **Coordination**\n\n**Group(s)**\n\n###### Action 1.2.4: Make ransomware attacks an investigation and prosecution priority, and communicate this directive internally and to the public.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) recently formed an internal task force to tackle ransomware and the Acting\nDeputy Attorney General issued guidance making ransomware an investigatory priority. The Task Force supports\nthis focus on ransomware and recommends that senior officials, such as the Attorney General, the Director of the\nFBI, and/or the Director of the United States Secret Service, sustain this focus at United States Attorney’s Offices\n(USAOs), FBI field offices, and Secret Service Task Forces to more aggressively pursue cases against ransomware\nactors. Consistent with this guidance, USAOs should prioritize ransomware prosecutions and seek harsher\npenalties for attacks on critical infrastructure or for attacks that endanger public health and safety.\n\nLegislation should also be considered to make ransomware and other Computer Fraud and Abuse Act offenses\nsubject to RICO, given the organized crime aspects of these offenses. Additionally, to raise the level of priority and\nclearly communicate that new status, officials should also pursue asset forfeiture against ransomware actors to\nthe maximum extent allowed by law and signal their intention to use this tool. This recommendation is expanded\nupon further in Actions 2.1.5 and 2.3.3.\n\n\n**Timing: 9-12 months.** **Lead: U.S. Department of Justice and Congress, and international equivalents.**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe United States must raise the Intelligence Community (IC) collection priority against ransomware actors\nso that all necessary resources, capabilities, and authorities can be brought to bear to answer the intelligence\nneeds to fulfill the tasks of the IWG and the JRTF. These must include (but are not limited to): signals intelligence\n(SIGINT) (including computer network operations, or CNO), human intelligence (HUMINT), and imagery intelligence\n(IMINT). This elevated prioritization must be accompanied by a reduction in the roadblocks that impede greater\nbidirectional sharing of information between the IC, international IC partners, and private industry, in order to fulfill\nthe intelligence needs of the IWG and the JRTF’s campaigns.\n\nTo establish the baseline for target development, the NSC should task an Intelligence Community Assessment\n(ICA) focused solely on ransomware actors and the criminal-state nexus. The goal of this ICA should be to\naccurately capture: the nature of the ransomware threat to national security; identification of actors and groups\nwho pose the most significant threat (including attribution to individuals involved whenever possible); locations\nfrom where they operate; and the infrastructure, tactics, and techniques they commonly use. The ICA should\nalso detail vulnerabilities that may exist within each actor group; any relationships between the actors and their\ngovernments that could negatively impact law enforcement’s ability to counter the threat; and any intelligence\ngaps that would need to be filled to more completely understand this threat.\n\nBased on the findings in the ICA and any other relevant intelligence, the IC should clearly designate ransomware\nactors as a national security threat at the level appropriate to the findings, and raise the priority of actively\ncountering the threat. The designation and priority level should ensure that all tools of national and international\npower are brought to bear to counter this threat in an aggressive, effective, but proportional, coordinated\ncampaign, as is detailed in 1.2.3.\n\n\n**Timing: 3 months.** **Lead: \u0007White House to task DNI, coordinate with Five Eyes Partners and international**\n_equivalents._\n\n\nInternational partners should work together to develop an international Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA)\non ransomware actors with the same goals described in Action 1.2.5 in order to create a more complete picture of\nthe global security threat posed by ransomware actors, and to serve as the baseline for coordinated international\nefforts. An international ICA will help raise the global intelligence collection priority against ransomware actors so\nthat all necessary resources can be brought to bear to answer the intelligence needs required to fulfill national and\ninternational collaborative efforts.\n\n\n**Timing: 3 months.** **Lead:\u0007** _\u0007White House to task DNI, coordinate with Five Eyes Partners and international_\n_equivalents._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Objective 1.3:  Substantially reduce safe havens where ransomware actors currently operate with impunity\n\n\n###### Many pernicious ransomware actors are given free reign by the nations where they reside and cannot be easily reached by international law enforcement agencies, either because a host country is actively protecting them, lacks the resources and capabilities to stop them, or does not prioritize the issue. Together with international partners, the U.S. should use a “carrot and stick” approach to motivate these nations to use all tools of national power — including critical law enforcement action — against the criminals operating within their borders or within friendly or neighboring countries.\n\n Action 1.3.1: Exert pressure on nations that are complicit or refuse to take action.\n\nNations should exert pressure on other nations that refuse to take action against ransomware criminals. These\nstrategies could include economic and trade sanctions; constrain “safe haven” country activity in international\nfinancial markets; using evidence of complicity to “name and shame” them in public forums to disrupt their\nfreedom of activity; withholding military or foreign assistance aid; or denying visas to citizens who seek to travel\nto the United States or other nations. Actions undertaken by the JRTF and the RTFH to disrupt the ransomware\nbusiness model should proactively be utilized to contribute to the intended deterrent effect of this sustained\npressure campaign.\n\n\n**Timing: 3 months, ongoing.** **Lead: U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Department of State.**\n\n\n###### Action 1.3.2: Incentivize cooperation and proactive action in resource-constrained countries.\n\n\nSome nations that serve as home bases for ransomware actors may not understand the gravity of this crime,\nor they may lack sufficient resources to prosecute ransomware criminals. The United States and other nations\nshould provide training and capacity-building to support these nations’ efforts, and provide direct law enforcement\nsupport, for example through joint law enforcement operations. Providing incentives to private-sector partners in\nthose nations may also increase these nations’ willingness to cooperate. Establishing ransomware as a priority in\nbilateral agreements could further bring these nations to the table.\n\n\n**Timing: 30 days and ongoing.** **Lead: \u0007U.S. Department of Justice and Department of State, and international**\n_equivalents._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Goal #2\n\n Disrupt the ransomware business model  and decrease criminal profits\n\n Ransomware is overwhelmingly a financially motivated crime, and as long as the profits outweigh the risks, attacks will continue. To effectively disrupt this threat, government and industry stakeholders must work collaboratively across borders to reduce the profitability of this criminal enterprise and increase the risk of ransomware execution. Governments can take diverse actions to:\n\n 1. Disrupt payment systems to make ransomware attacks less profitable; 2. Disrupt the infrastructure used to facilitate attacks; and 3. \u0007Disrupt ransomware actors themselves, through criminal prosecution and other tactics.\n\n This must all be done while minimizing harm to the victims of ransomware and not interfering with their ability to recover their systems.\n\n\n**The flow of money from a victim to a ransomware actor using cryptocurrency is complex.**\n**See Appendix B for a detailed guide on this process, and how entities like cryptocurrency exchanges**\n**fit within this ecosystem.**\n\n\n###### Objective 2.1:  Disrupt the system that facilitates the payment of ransoms.\n\n\n###### Ransomware attacks are profitable because ransom payments are made through the use of diverse cryptocurrencies, where payments are difficult to trace and can easily be laundered. The challenge for governments is to find new ways to get inside the ransomware payments process. It will be important to set measurable goals to assess progress toward this objective.\n\n\n###### Action 2.1.1: Develop new levers for voluntary sharing of cryptocurrency payment indicators.\n\n\nIn addition to the mandatory disclosure of a ransomware payment recommendation in Action 4.2.4, lawmakers\nshould create incentives to share timely and actionable cryptocurrency payment indicators to enable law\nenforcement to prioritize leads and seize ransom payments when possible. This information may include wallet\naddresses, transaction hashes, and ransom notes. In exchange for this information, victims should be able to\nreport anonymously, unless a victim is otherwise required to disclose the attack under privacy laws. Congress\nshould broaden the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 to cover this type of information sharing,\nexplicitly preserving attorney-client privilege and implementing parameters that limit how this information could\nlater be used by regulators or as part of civil litigation, to encourage participation.\n\n\n**Timing: 6 to 12 months.** **Lead: Congress, CISA, and other international equivalents.**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Action 2.1.2: Require cryptocurrency exchanges, crypto kiosks, and over-the-counter (OTC) trading “desks” to comply with existing laws.\n\n\nLawmakers need to pursue and enforce consistent licensing and registration requirements for cryptocurrency\nexchanges, crypto kiosks, and OTC trading desks where criminals “cash out” their cryptocurrency from ransomware\npayments. These entities are not consistently compliant with or subject to Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money\nLaundering (AML), and Combatting Financing of Terrorism (CFT) laws, and those that are subject to those laws do\nnot consistently report suspicious transactions to law enforcement or other institutions.[56] These laws must designate\nclear enforcement bodies to penalize non-compliant exchanges, kiosks, and OTC desks.\n\n\n-----\n\nTraditional financial institutions that fund these entities should also impose stricter rules. They should pursue\nSEC enforcement of cryptocurrency businesses that fail to register as broker-dealers, transfer agents, clearing\nagencies, and money service businesses (MSBs), with particular focus on mixing services that obfuscate criminal\ntransactions with legal traffic.\n\n\n**Timing: 12 months.** **Lead: \u0007Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission, and other**\n_international equivalents._\n\n\nRegulators should incentivize cryptocurrency exchanges, crypto kiosks, over-the-counter trading desks, and\nfinancial institutions to increase their reporting of suspicious transactions to federal law enforcement, to facilitate\njoint disruptive actions. In the U.S., these entities would use Section 314(b)[57] reports and suspicious activity\nreports (SARs) to report suspicious transactions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the\nU.S. Treasury Department. In addition, the Department of Treasury should streamline its processes for sharing\nSARs with exchanges, blacklisting wallets, and sharing with relevant federal and non-federal entities that may take\nother timely disruptive action.\n\n\n**Timing: 12 months.** **Lead: U.S. Treasury Department (FinCEN) and international equivalents.**\n\n\n###### Action 2.1.4: Centralize expertise in cryptocurrency seizure, and scale criminal seizure processes.\n\n\nLaw enforcement action on the basis of ransomware reporting must be swift as criminals strive to quickly\nmove funds beyond their reach. In the U.S., law enforcement can provide a cryptocurrency exchange with\na letter requesting that ransomware funds be frozen at the exchange as proceeds of crime to be seized by\nthe government. If done in time and with cooperation from the exchange, this can make the identified funds\nunavailable to the ransomware actors. This letter must be followed up with a seizure order from an attorney within\nthe Department of Justice, a process that, at the moment, is scattered across the United States, assigned to\ndifferent investigations, and assigned to attorneys with varying experience drafting these orders.\n\nKey units within the Department of Justice — including the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\n(CCIPS), Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Network (CHIPS), National Security Cyber Specialists\n(NCSC), the National Security Division (NSD), and the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS)\n— should identify attorneys who are knowledgeable in civil and criminal seizures related to cryptocurrency, and\nengage them to serve as a focal point for seizure orders across ransomware investigations. This should be\npart of the campaign tasked to the JRTF described in Action 1.2.2 or to the recently formed DOJ ransomwarefocused task force. This would dramatically streamline the current process, ensure seizure orders are pursued\nexpeditiously, and increase the number of seizure orders served, thereby making it more difficult for ransomware\nadversaries to convert virtual currency to fiat.\n\n\n**Timing: 6 to 12 months.** **Lead: U.S. Department of Justice and international equivalents.**\n\n\n-----\n\nFor individual ransomware victims, the economics of\npursuing civil remedies against liable actors may not\nmake sense, given the case may require extensive\nfactual investigation and innovative legal efforts. To\nsolve this problem, insurers and reinsurers should\nmeasure and assert their aggregated ransomware\nlosses and establish a common “war chest”\nsubrogation fund to evaluate and pursue strategies\naimed at subrogation recoveries, including restitution,\nrecovery, or civil asset seizures, on behalf of victims\nand in conjunction with law enforcement efforts.\n\nMany insurers currently maintain individual subrogation\nunits, but these do not typically act within the context\nof ransomware. This is because insurers may not be\nfamiliar with the novel legal and investigative expertise\nneeded to pursue ransomware actors; they may believe\nthe chances of recovery are unclear, and the cases\nmay span multiple international jurisdictions where\ninsurers may not typically pursue subrogation. This\ncommon “war chest” subrogation fund may sit within\na consortium (as described in Action 2.1.7) established\nby insurers and reinsurers to properly resource and\nscale novel efforts to pursue civil recoveries against\nliable actors, kickstarting efforts in civil courts to obtain\njustice, while pooling the costs associated with any one\ncase, alleviating concerns about uncertain results.\n\n\n**Timing: 6 to 12 months.**\n**Lead: Domestic and international insurance and**\n_reinsurance firms._\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a whistleblower reward program that\nhas already yielded several billion dollars in penalties that the U.S. would not have otherwise obtained. A public\nwhistleblower campaign in this vein should be targeted toward geographic regions around the world, and provide\nawards for information leading to the identification of individuals involved with developing ransomware, money\nlaundering of fiat, coding, ransom negotiations, and other roles. In addition to financial awards, such a program\ncould include non-monetary rewards, such as a path to citizenship. Any reward program should be designed in a\nway to protect the anonymity of the reporter of the criminal activity.\n\n\n**Timing: 6 to 12 months.** **Lead: The Securities and Exchange Commission and international equivalents.**\n\n\nInsurers and reinsurers should voluntarily establish an industry consortium to aggregate and share anonymized,\npertinent data to support threat-actor disruption, including both payment information (such as wallet addresses,\nransom demands, negotiation outcomes, and transaction hashes) and attack information.\n\nData sharing at the consortium should also accelerate the maturation of best practices and sustainability of the\ncyber insurance market, as this data enables further risk modeling and underwriting analysis. This consortium\nshould improve risk management and resolution strategies so that ransomware is less frequent, less destructive,\nand less profitable for the threat actors. It should also enable insurers and reinsurers to establish certainty with\nlaw enforcement and regulators such as OFAC as to the legality of any payment and as with respect to sanctions.\nFinally, the consortium may serve as the home of any common subrogation “war chest” fund for collaboration,\nas described in Action 2.1.5. This consortium should also work directly with the JRTF and RTFH as described in\nactions 1.2.2 and 1.2.3.\n\n\n**Timing: 6-12 months (to establish consortium and initial subrogation effort).**\n**Lead: Domestic and international insurance and reinsurance firms.**\n\n\n###### Objective 2.2:  Target the infrastructure used by ransomware criminals\n\n\n###### Ransomware actors rely on infrastructure to carry out their attacks, including servers and networks that serve as “command and control” for their attacks. Law enforcement agencies have opportunities to disrupt ransomware criminals by targeting this infrastructure.\n\n\n###### Action 2.2.1: Leverage the global network of ransomware investigation hubs.\n\n\nThe global network of ransomware investigative hubs recommended in Action 1.1.3 (and utilized by the coalition\nrecommended in 1.1.2 and the JRTF recommended in Action 1.2.2), including leveraging cyber assistant legal\nattachés (ALATs) and ICHIP prosecutors, should have access to specialists that are empowered to focus efforts\n\n\n-----\n\non infrastructure aimed at the “left of boom” elements of the criminal business model. This includes, among other\nareas, credential theft or other unauthorized access; malware distribution, including the use of malicious domains\nand criminal and abusive command and controls; criminal surveillance; and theft of intellectual property.\n\n\n**Timing: 6-12 months.** **Lead: U.S. Federal Government and international equivalents.**\n\n\nCurrently, private-industry companies — including but not limited to hosting companies, internet service providers,\nand telecommunications companies — are actively working with law enforcement and other industry partners to\ndisrupt infrastructure associated with ransomware actors. This infrastructure may include malicious servers used\nto facilitate or conduct attacks against victims. If a service provider is tipped to malicious infrastructure, it should\nbe able to take action against the infrastructure without fear of legal liability. For example, if a hosting company is\nmade aware that a customer is conducting attacks from one of the hosting company’s servers, they can typically\nshut down the customer’s service due to a violation of the company’s terms of service. In a less clear scenario,\nif a telecommunications company is provided a signature that identifies malicious network traffic and they block\nthe traffic from transiting their network, thereby disrupting the malicious activity, the company may have some\nlegal liability.\n\nCongress should ensure private industry can actively block or limit traffic when acting in good faith without\nfear of legal liability. Specifically, Congress should modernize the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and\nother cybersecurity laws to take into account activities that cybersecurity companies, security researchers,\nservice providers, and other responsible parties are currently doing “at risk” in gray areas in order to protect their\ncustomers.\n\nTo be clear, this is not advocating for “hacking back,” rather it is focused on decriminalizing practical security\nactivities necessary to counter modern cybersecurity threats, including against criminal infrastructure like botnets\nused in ransomware.\n\n\n**Timing: 12 to 24 months. Lead: U.S. Congress and international equivalents.**\n\n\n###### Objective 2.3:  Disrupt the threat actors, including ransomware developers, criminal affiliates,  and ransomware variants\n\n\n###### Action 2.3.1: Increase government sharing of ransomware intelligence.\n\n\nThe government should increase the sharing of intelligence about ransomware actors with the private and\nnonprofit sectors, including key data points that specifically lead back to the threat actors. Such information\ncould include threat actor personas, tradecraft, and attribution (including roles and responsibilities); behavioral\ntactics and techniques; and related technical information (i.e., indicators of compromise). Making such\nintelligence more broadly available would enable the private sector to protect itself more effectively; better\n\n\n-----\n\ncoordinate with government entities, such as the JRTF and RTFH in Action 1.2.2; and support governments in\ndisrupting ransomware activity.\n\n\n**Timing: 6 months and ongoing.  Lead: Department of Homeland Security and international equivalents.**\n\n\nTo better operationalize and focus resources, the U.S. Government and the security community should work\ntogether to create prioritized target decks for ransomware developers, criminal affiliates, and ransomware variants\nbased on how much harm they are doing and the breadth of their operations. The core of this effort must focus\non unveiling the threat actors themselves and understanding their organization(s), with the goal of identifying\nvulnerabilities that can be exploited to disrupt the threat, using all capabilities available to the private industry and\ngovernments. This effort should include working more closely with the security community on a routine basis to\nshare information and coordinate operations, to be facilitated by the JRTF and RTFH described in Action 1.2.2.\n\n\n**Timing: 6 to 12 months.** **Lead: U.S. Federal Government and international equivalents.**\n\n\nRansomware events are not singular, but part of an ongoing campaign of extortion against government and\nprivate-sector entities. Kill-chain analyses of ransomware organizations reveal a complex network of associates\nand entities. These organizations have been established to function as an extortion operation with repeatable\noutcomes. The various components of the organization include creators of malware, establishment of\nransomware affiliates, franchise fees or percentage of ransomware payouts to the operation leaders, digital wallet\ncreation, money laundering, using money mules, and more.\n\nLaw enforcement should disrupt the ransomware criminal enterprise by using established frameworks that\nhave been applied successfully to disrupt the activities of the mafia and other criminal organizations. The U.S.\ngovernment should leverage the power of the RICO statute, as called for above in Action 1.2.4, to prosecute\nransomware criminals. The RICO statute (Title 18 USCS § 1962) serves as a “mafia business tax”, and prohibits\nracketeering. RICO investigations provide influential tools to inspire cooperation of members and supporters of\na criminal enterprise, such as enhanced prison terms for any conspirators, and forfeiture and exposure to civil\nRICO investigations. If deemed necessary, the federal government should undertake immediate action to ensure\nransomware crimes are predicates for use of the RICO statutes.\n\n\n**Timing: 12 to 24 months.** **Lead: U.S. Law Enforcement and international equivalents.**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Goal #3\n\n Help organizations prepare for  ransomware attacks\n\n Any organization can fall victim to ransomware, creating catastrophic disruption for the organization and those it serves. Yet despite extensive press coverage and content on this topic, the threat is poorly understood by many public- and private-sector leaders, and the majority of organizations lack an appropriate level of preparedness to defend against these attacks. Even firms that have invested in cybersecurity broadly may be unaware of how to prepare for, and defend specifically against, ransomware attacks, and information available is in many cases oversimplified or excessively complicated.\n\n The challenge is to increase awareness and build defenses that will be effective both at scale and over time as the threat evolves. To do this, governments and industry leaders need to better connect with key audiences, including both the organizational leaders who need to understand that ransomware is a real and relevant threat to their organization, and also the individuals in operational roles (such as IT and security professionals) who need guidance on how to prioritize mitigation efforts given limited resources. Support should be customized based on each organization’s current situation, including to what extent it is already appropriately informed and whether it has appropriately invested in time and resources.\n\n\n###### Objective 3.1:  Support organizations with developing practical operational capabilities\n\n\n###### Guides and technological tools to mitigate ransomware are currently available; however, many are insufficient, overly simplified, or too complicated, and the general level of noise surrounding this problem is confusing and problematic.\n\n\n###### Action 3.1.1: Develop a clear, actionable framework for ransomware mitigation, response, and recovery.\n\n\nAlthough multiple organizations have published ransomware guides, no single, authoritative source of best practices\nexists. The current state of awareness around ransomware is similar to the general environment prior to 2014, when\nno compilation of best practices existed for cybersecurity. At that time, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology (NIST) led a multi-stakeholder process to develop the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure\n_Cybersecurity. This framework has been widely adopted by organizations around the world and serves as a foundational_\ncybersecurity risk management resource.\n\n**We have reached a similar point with the ransomware threat. The single most impactful measure that could be**\n**taken to help organizations prepare for and respond to ransomware attacks would be to create one internationally**\n**accepted framework that lays out clear, actionable steps to defend against, and recover from, ransomware.**\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware is a global problem, so governments and private-sector organizations around the world should collaborate\non this effort to ensure the framework will work internationally. Efforts taken only in one jurisdiction may be regionally\neffective, but will likely push attackers to focus on different regions; a coordinated international effort will create greater\nlong-term impact and more effectively disrupt the economics of the cybercrime market. It will also drive greater\nadoption in organizations that operate in more than one country.\n\nAs far as is practical, the framework should be consistent with existing cybersecurity frameworks, such as International\nStandards Organization publications[59] and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework,[60] but it should be specific to\nransomware. It should build on the work that NIST’s National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence has already done as\npart of the data integrity project and related papers. The framework should clearly identify each recommended action’s\nimpact, as well as the required investment of time and other resources. It should include multiple layers for different\naudiences; similar to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the top layer would be intended for executive decision makers,\nthe second and third layers for operational managers, and the fourth layer for front-line implementers.\n\nThe ransomware-specific framework should also identify what approaches are most successful in dealing with\nransomware and why. The framework should identify what constitutes a reasonable due diligence review prior to\npayment, consistent with actions 4.1.1 and 4.1.2, which address the creation of ransomware emergency response\nauthorities and a ransomware response fund.\n\nIn addition, industry-specific profiles should be developed to tailor the Ransomware Framework to different industries or\nsectors. Creating different profiles for local governments, small- and medium-sized businesses, and large enterprises,\nfor example, would enable different types of organizations to adapt the framework to their particular situations.\n\n\n**Timing: 12-24 months, and updated yearly thereafter.**\n**Lead: NIST for the US, and international equivalents, with private-sector participation.**\n\n\nAdditional materials should be developed to accompany the ransomware prevention framework, drawing from\nexisting resources, to further articulate how organizations can leverage specific security capabilities, technologies,\nand policies to meet the frameworks’ identified best practices. Such materials could include:\n\n  - Detailed deployment toolkits and guides to assist specific sectors or market segments with applying\nthe framework;\n\n  - Mappings to existing popular cybersecurity frameworks, e.g. NIST, ISOs, CIS controls\n\n  - A ransomware-specific risk assessment tool;\n\n  - Ransomware reference architectures (such as those developed by NIST’s National Cybersecurity\nCenter of Excellence);\n\n  - A ransomware killchain;\n\n  - A checklist to help organizations to hold managed service providers (MSPs) and IT vendors accountable.\n\n\n**Timing: 12-24 months, and updated regularly thereafter.** **Lead: \u0007NIST for the US, and other international**\n_equivalents._\n\n\n-----\n\nMany decision aids exist to aid organizations preparing for, and responding to, ransomware attacks. While this\nvolume of content is designed to help, it can in fact hinder preparedness or response as organizations struggle\nto identify the most relevant and actionable guidance for their situation. It is challenging for organizations to\ndetermine which guides can be trusted to provide high-quality, accurate advice. To address these shortcomings,\nthe Task Force recommends a two-pronged approach.\n\nFirst, internet search companies could take steps to make sorting through online materials easier. For example,\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, internet search companies took steps to highlight credible content related to the\npandemic to make it easier to find the most up-to-date and relevant information, and also to minimize the negative\nimpact of mis- or disinformation. A similar effort focused on ransomware would help IT and security professionals\nnavigate this highly complex and evolving threat landscape, and quickly identify the most important information\nand guidance. Once the Ransomware Framework and complementary materials are published, these would be\nprioritized on these search pages.\n\nSecond, a nonprofit entity, such as the Cybercrime Support Network, should collect and maintain a reference\nlibrary of decision aids and best practice guides for responding to a ransomware attack. This step would provide a\nvetted library of material for organizations to draw on to prepare for and/or respond to a ransomware attack.\n\n\n**Timing: 6-12 months for first iteration, and ongoing thereafter.**\n**Lead: For curation, internet search companies. For aggregation, a nonprofit like the Cybercrime Support**\n_Network (CSN) could lead this process in the U.S., together with international partners._\n\n\n###### Objective 3.2:  Increase knowledge and prioritization among organizational leaders\n\n\n###### There is a stark difference between being aware of ransomware as a threat and having a real understanding of the dynamics, mitigations, and potential impacts of an attack. Organizational leaders need greater understanding about the significance and relevance of the ransomware threat in order to allocate resources and prioritize focus.\n\n\n###### Action 3.2.1: Develop business-level materials oriented toward organizational leaders.\n\n\nOrganizational leaders traditionally see security as niche and highly technical. They need to understand\nransomware as a whole-organization event, in non-technical, business risk-relevant terms. While the Ransomware\nFramework described in Action 3.1.1 has a top layer aimed at executives, additional materials should highlight\nbusiness needs and risks, and aim toward educating organizational leaders about the threat.\n\nThese materials should include a simplified and translated overview of the framework; a ransomware primer\nfor business leaders; or a checklist for organizational leaders to address with operational staff. They could also\ninclude detailed case studies of real, anonymized attacks related to critical sectors, highlighting how ransomware\nattacks occurred and the resulting business impact. Any materials should also consider the regulatory landscape,\n\n\n-----\n\nemphasizing how adhering to preparatory frameworks\ncan reduce the likelihood of fines or other penalties.\n\n\n**Timing: 6-12 months, with updates yearly as needed.**\n**Lead: CISA or equivalent international government**\n_agency tasked with capacity-building around_\n_cybersecurity._\n\n\nA government-backed awareness campaign will not\nonly help raise the profile of ransomware as a serious\nbusiness issue, but it will also increase the credibility\nand need for focus among busy organizational leaders.\nThis should be coordinated with efforts addressing\noperational technical roles. Such a campaign should\nleverage appropriate international organizations, state\nand local governmental entities, non-profits, and\nindustry organizations and influencers. It should also\nbe accompanied by tabletop exercises that provide\nopportunities for learning and collaboration.\n\nAdditionally, as many organizational leaders rely\non trade or local business networks to learn about\nchallenges facing organizations in their sector or\nregion, we recommend engaging these organizations\nin awareness campaigns. In the United States,\norganizations that could be considered include\nChambers of Commerce, the National Association\nof Corporate Directors, the Young Presidents’\nOrganization, and various trade associations. These\norganizations may need funding in order to be able to\ntake on a campaign of this significance.\n\n\n**Timing: 12-24 months years, and ongoing for as**\n_long as relevant._\n**Lead: U.S. Federal government and international**\n_equivalents, appropriate agency leads (e.g.,_\n_Education or Homeland Security or equivalents),_\n_and key nonprofit partners._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Objective 3.3:  Update existing, or introduce new, cybersecurity regulations to address ransomware\n\n\n###### Regulations and standards related to cybersecurity vary widely, and in most cases do not specifically address ransomware. Updating regulations and filling gaps with new regulations will help drive better adoption of ransomware mitigations in core regulated sectors.\n\n For the new regulations proposed below, the government may want to consider a mechanism to address how quickly the technology and threat landscapes evolve, compared to the process for updating laws and regulations. For example, a private- or public-sector standards body (e.g. NIST, the Center for Internet Security, or a group similar to the Payment Card Industry Security Council) could set and annually update minimum required standards, and the law would incorporate this group’s standards.\n\n Action 3.3.1: Update cyber-hygiene regulations and standards.\n\nExisting cybersecurity regulations — such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in\nthe United States, and the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS) in the European Union,\nas well as non-regulatory standards such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) — all\nset a baseline for cybersecurity in specific regulated sectors where protection of data and essential services\nis considered critical. Though some targeted guidance exists,[62] many standards do not specifically address\nransomware, despite the significance of this threat. These and other existing cybersecurity regulations and\nstandards should thus be reviewed and, where necessary, updated to incorporate measures that align with the\nrecommended Ransomware Framework (see Action 3.1.1) to more directly mitigate ransomware attacks\n\n\n**Timing: Dependent on the creation of the Ransomware Framework (Action 3.1.1); likely 12-24 months, with**\n_subsequent iterations in the long term (24+ months)._\n**Lead: State and federal government(s) or equivalent law-making bodies, with support from state/local entities,**\n_think tanks, and nonprofits._\n\n\n###### Action 3.3.2: Require local governments to adopt limited baseline security measures.\n\n\nRansomware attacks impacting local governments are catastrophic not only for the organizations themselves, but also\nfor the constituents they serve. Mandating certain behaviors and practices will help local governments better defend\nagainst attacks, and may help them provide enhanced support for small-to-medium-sized businesses operating in\ntheir jurisdiction. In the United States, required measures could include:\n\n  - Joining the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC);\n\n  - Signing up for the MS-ISAC’s Malicious Domain Blocking and Reporting (MDBR),[63] unless already running a\ncomparable DNS filtering service; and\n\n  - Signing up for CISA’s infrastructure and web application scanning services.[64]\n\nOther measures could include the MS-ISAC offering ransomware-specific training and support to cities, though\nany additional requirements would likely require funding or financial incentives.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Timing: 6-12 months, and updated yearly thereafter.**\n**Lead: U.S. Federal Government and international equivalents.**\n\n\nManaged service providers (MSPs) often cover the IT and security functions for organizations that cannot invest in\nin-house expertise and technologies. MSPs do not commonly provide extensive security coverage or ransomware\nmitigations, but doing so would likely create widespread positive impact for small-to-medium-sized organizations.\nBaseline security measures for MSPs could include:\n\n  - Adherence with a cyber-hygiene program (for example, CIS Controls Implementation Group 1[65] and the\nNIST Cybersecurity Framework;[66]\n\n  - Mandatory disclosure across the MSP’s customer base if there is a ransomware incident involving the\nMSP’s service offering; and\n\n  - Forming an MSP-ISAC, an information sharing and analysis center specific to this industry.\n\nNote that some funding or financial incentivization may initially be needed to help MSPs develop cybersecurity capabilities.\n\n\n**Timing: 6-12 months.** **Lead: U.S. Congress and international equivalent lawmakers.**\n\n\n###### Objective 3.4:  Financially incentivize adoption of ransomware mitigations\n\n\n###### Many organizations are under-invested in cybersecurity and resilience, and may lack the resources to manage the ransomware threat. By providing financial incentives, governments can help the most vulnerable and resource-constrained organizations tackle this issue. For some organizations, incentives may be the only means available to prepare for, and defend against, a ransomware attack.\n\n\n###### Action 3.4.1: Highlight ransomware as a priority in existing funding provisions.\n\n\nWhere grants or funding are already offered and may be used for cybersecurity activity, we recommend that the\naccompanying language should be updated to highlight ransomware preparedness as a priority for spending and focus.\n\nAccording to a Third Way paper on U.S. federal grants for cybersecurity,[67] eight existing preparedness grants\nare available to state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments, transportation authorities, nonprofits, and\nprivate entities through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). These have recently been changed\nto allow recipients to spend funds on cybersecurity, as when FEMA identified cybersecurity as a “priority area” in\n2018 for the largest DHS preparedness grant, and required fund recipients to spend at least 5% of their funds on\ncybersecurity for critical infrastructure. This prioritization and funding expansion should continue across additional\ngrants and should specifically highlight ransomware preparedness as an urgent priority.\n\n\n**Timing: 3-6 months.** **Lead: Relevant fund designation agencies.**\n\n\n-----\n\nUnder current law, Homeland Security Preparedness Grants focus on terrorism. Given the threat that ransomware\nposes to U.S. state, local, tribal, and territorial government entities, expanding this grant program to encompass\ncybersecurity threats would provide tremendous benefits. In addition to making SLTTs more resilient to ransomware,\nthese investments will likely improve service delivery as upgrading software and hardware is often the most costeffective security investment an organization can make. As noted in Action 3.4.3, access to these grants should be\nconditioned upon demonstrated alignment with the Ransomware Framework after it is developed.\n\n\n**Timing: 6-12 months.** **Lead: Department of Homeland Security, working with Congress.**\n\n\nIn 2018, the U.S. Congress’s Help America Vote Act (HAVA) allocated grant funds to help states bolster their\nelection security. A similar model, through which states manage the delivery of grant funds to municipalities,\ncould be employed to provide grants as financial incentives for demonstrated alignment with the Ransomware\nFramework. This could help motivate U.S. State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial government entities (SLTTs) to better\nprepare for and defend themselves against a ransomware attack. Continued provision of such grants should be\nbased on clear measures of progress and advancement toward self-reliance. A similar model could be investigated\nfor suitability in other countries.\n\n\n**Timing: Dependent on the creation of the Ransomware Framework in Action 3.1.1; likely 12-24 months.**\n**Lead: U.S. Federal government and international equivalents.**\n\n\n###### Action 3.4.4: Alleviate fines for critical infrastructure entities that align with the Ransomware Framework.\n\n\nA recent amendment to the HITECH ACT[68] requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, when\nconsidering whether an entity should be fined for a HIPAA Security Rule-related violation, to consider the extent\nto which the entity has demonstrated alignment to an established risk management framework. A similar model\ncould apply to other regulated critical infrastructure sectors to strongly incentivize adherence to established risk\nmanagement frameworks for ransomware prevention.\n\n\n**Timing: 12-24 months.** **Lead: U.S. Federal government and international equivalents.**\n\n\n###### Action 3.4.5: Investigate tax breaks as an incentive for organizations to adopt secure IT services.\n\n\nGovernments should offer tax breaks or other financial incentives to businesses that meet certain baseline\nstandards for ransomware preparedness, as laid out in the Ransomware Framework under Action 3.1.1. Such a\nprogram should be structured to ensure long-term self-reliance. Leveraging tax breaks could help drive adoption of\nbest practices for preparation for ransomware attacks; however, there are many practical considerations around\nwho would qualify, whether the savings would offset costs, and how organizations would prove their qualification.\n\n\n.Timing: 24 months.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Goal #4\n\n Respond to ransomware attacks  more effectively\n\n For victim organizations, a ransomware attack can be a stressful, potentially existential event. Crucial decisions about how to respond — including whether to pay the ransom — must be made under intense pressure. Facing the potential threat of losing their data permanently, organizations may make hurried decisions, particularly if they lack understanding about the ramifications of paying a ransom or the full range of alternatives open to them.\n\n In order to improve organizations’ ability to respond to ransomware attacks more effectively, government and industry leaders should increase the resources and information available to ransomware victims. At the same time, governments should require organizations to take certain actions before paying a ransom, including reporting the payment to the government. Ultimately, increased support for ransomware victims, including improved awareness of legal requirements prior to payment, will decrease the number of organizations that feel compelled or trapped into paying ransoms.\n\n\n###### Objective 4.1:  Increase support for ransomware victims\n\n\n###### Ransomware can severely disrupt an organization’s business operations, and remediation efforts can take a long time. The resulting revenue loss can prove untenable for many companies, and can be a major crisis for hospitals and other critical infrastructure. Further, for many local governments and small- and medium-sized businesses, the cost of rebuilding networks to avoid paying the ransom is prohibitively expensive. A platform of support resources should be established and made available to help ransomware victims with the recovery process.\n\n\n###### Action 4.1.1: Create ransomware emergency response authorities.\n\n\nRansomware attacks that have widespread, disruptive effects across society often fall outside the scope of\ntraditional disaster response authorities. To address this gap, national governments should create special\nauthorities to mitigate the effects of ransomware attacks that have impacts beyond the affected organization.\nThe Cyberspace Solarium Commission recommended creating the authority to declare a “cyber disaster.”[69] The\nRansomware Task Force supports this idea and recommends that it should explicitly cover ransomware incidents.\n\nA cyber-disaster authority would enable federal agencies to assist victim organizations and local governments,\nas well as make other resources available, such as incident response support and forensic analysis. Such actions\nshould be limited to dealing with the immediate crisis and not long-term, ongoing engagement. To enable such\n\n\n-----\n\n“cyber disaster declarations,” Congress could choose to amend the primary law governing natural disaster\nresponse activities, typically referred to as the Stafford Act, to explicitly cover cyber incidents, or it could create a\nnew, separate authority.\n\n\n**Timing: 12-24 months.** **Lead: U.S. Federal government, and international equivalents.**\n\n\nWhile a company might determine that paying a ransom is economically rational, such a decision supports the\ncriminal enterprise and is rarely in the public interest. To enable more companies to bear the financial cost of\nremediation, national governments should create “Cyber Response and Recovery Funds” (CRRFs). In addition\nto other goals, a CRRF should cover restoring IT functionality for local governments, critical national functions,\nor other entities as they recover from a ransomware attack, particularly when those entities lack access to\nappropriate cyber insurance or when a cyber insurance policy does not cover the event. This approach would\nbe similar to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, which “provides for a transparent system of shared public\nand private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism.”[70] If such funding\nwere available for ransomware victims, then cost would play a smaller role in an organization’s decision about\nwhether to pay the ransom. As an incentive to invest in cybersecurity, governments could consider requiring the\norganization to cover some portion of the ransom as a “deductible.” Governments could also consider additional\nrequirements to access the fund, such as demonstrating use of the Ransomware Framework in Action 3.1.1, to\nraise organizations’ overall level of cybersecurity.\n\n\n**Timing: 12-24 months.** **Lead: \u0007U.S. Federal government in consultation with the insurance industry, and**\n_international equivalents._\n\n\nMany organizations will seek government assistance during a ransomware attack. In the United States, the\nTreasury Department’s guidance on ransomware payments essentially requires organizations to consult with\nthe Department if they want to pay the ransom. However, in many countries, agencies cannot fully meet their\nmandates with existing resources, nor is it always clear which agency has the responsibility or capability to\naddress an inquiry.\n\nTherefore, governments should increase funding for agencies to respond to ransomware-related inquiries so they\ncan meet demand, through a combination of additional staff and improved technology. In addition, in the U.S.\ncontext, the Department of Homeland Security’s CISA should consider providing a concierge or ombudsman service\nfor private-sector entities seeking guidance on ransomware-related questions. Under this approach, CISA would not\nbe responsible for interpreting another agency’s guidance, but it would direct the inquiry to the correct office within\nthe Federal government. This assistance would facilitate better decision-making within the private sector.\n\nFor example, the U.S. Treasury Department has indicated that ransom payments could violate sanctions against\ncertain individuals or organizations. Treasury’s guidance also indicates that organizations can be held strictly\nliable for such payments, which means they can be punished for sanctions violations, even if they were unaware\n\n\n-----\n\nor unable to determine that the recipient is on a prohibited list. As a result, many organizations will want to know\nwhether a potential payment recipient is a sanctioned entity. Given the volume of potential ransomware payments,\nthe Treasury will likely need additional resources to meet demands from the private sector. Second, inquiries may\nnot initially go to the Treasury; CISA could ensure that inquiries it receives regarding Treasury guidance get routed\nto the correct office.\n\n\n**Timing: 12-24 months.** **Lead: U.S. Federal government, and international equivalents.**\n\n\nIn October 2020, the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued\nan advisory to companies providing services to ransomware victims. This advisory indicates that OFAC will\nconsider ransomware payments as a sanctions violation if the recipient is on the Specially Designated Nationals\nand Blocked Persons List (SDN List), another blocked person, or covered by comprehensive country or region\nembargoes. Additionally, the advisory states that a violation by a non-U.S. person that causes a U.S. person to\nviolate any sanctions, or U.S. persons facilitating actions of non-U.S. persons in an effort to avoid U.S. sanctions\nregulations, are also prohibited. Finally, the advisory notes that any penalties could be assessed under strict\nliability, which means even if an organization did not know that paying the recipient would constitute a sanctions\nviolation, they can still be held liable for the action.\n\nWhile this guidance may seem straightforward, Task Force members who have specifically worked within this\nregime made the point that identifying payment recipients can prove quite challenging, especially under the short\ntimelines of a ransomware attack. Even if an organization asks OFAC whether a particular recipient falls into a\nprohibited category or seeks a payment license, OFAC is not resourced to provide answers rapidly enough for a\ncompany facing tight extortion timelines. Experts have identified other unanswered questions with the advisory.\nWhile the Task Force supports Treasury’s goal of reducing payments to criminals and in particular to prohibited\nentities, the advisory does not provide sufficient detail to be effective in achieving this outcome.\n\nTherefore, the Task Force recommends that the U.S. Treasury Department issue additional clarifying guidance to\nsupplement this advisory. This clarifying guidance should address such issues as what constitutes due diligence\nin determining the payment recipient’s identity, the liability OFAC would assign to each stakeholder, the timeline\nand process for obtaining a payment license (should an organization choose to pursue that route), and to what\nextent OFAC would consider the harms to people serviced by a ransomware victim in determining whether to grant\na license, if required. Taking into consideration the OFAC Advisory, as well as the almost simultaneous Financial\nCrimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Advisory and the Department of Justice Framework issued in October\n2020, OFAC should coordinate with these government counterparts to ensure the clarification considers their\ngoals and incorporates them into OFAC’s response to this request for clarification.\n\n**Timing: 6-12 months.** **Lead: \u0007U.S. Treasury Department. During the update process, the Treasury Department should**\n_consult with relevant industry, academia, civil society, and cybersecurity experts._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Objective 4.2:  Increase the quality and volume of information about ransomware incidents\n\n\n###### While everyone agrees that ransomware is a significant problem, there is a lack of reliable, representative data about ransomware’s scope and scale. Further, information about ongoing ransomware threats does not yet reach as much of the digital ecosystem as it should – to include both across sectors of private industry or within responsible governmental departments and agencies. Therefore, improving the quality and volume of ransomware information would enable better deterrence, enhance preparedness, and inform disruption activities.\n\n Action 4.2.1: Establish a Ransomware Incident Response Network (RIRN).\n\nTo increase the flow of ransomware information, a wide array of public and private organizations should formally\nagree to share such information rapidly and in standardized formats. To implement this action, the Task Force\nrecommends the creation of the Ransomware Incident Response Network (RIRN). The RIRN would serve several\nfunctions, including facilitating receipt and sharing of incident reports, directing organizations to ransomware\nincident response services, aggregating data, and sharing or issuing alerts about ongoing threats. Not all entities\nwithin the RIRN would participate in all RIRN functions. For example, some RIRN organizations might not accept\nindividual incident reports or conduct incident response activities, but they could refer inquiries to another RIRN\norganization that would.\n\nRIRN entities engaged in the receipt and sharing of specific incident reports would agree to receive and share\nreports using the standard format developed under 4.2.2; adopt a system of unique identifiers to avoid doublecounts while maintaining anonymity; and share the resulting information in an anonymized form with other\ncyber intelligence organizations and national governments in the network, including law enforcement. RIRN\norganizations would also agree to direct reporting entities to available public and private resources, including\nincident responders that could assist the entity through the ransomware attack. The RIRN should consider\nwhether to enable organizations to report anonymously, such that the receiving organization does not know the\nidentity of the submitter.\n\nOther RIRN functions could include sharing or issuing alerts about ransomware threats in non-technical language.\nSuch alerts would be designed to engage as broad an audience as possible and to prompt action to counter\nspecific threats.\n\nThe RIRN network should include non-profit organizations, such as the Cybercrime Support Network, Cyber\nReadiness Institute, Global Resilience Institute, Global Cyber Alliance, Information Sharing and Analysis\nOrganizations, and Cyber Threat Alliance; for-profit entities, including cybersecurity vendors, insurance providers,\nand incident responders; and national government agencies, including law enforcement.\n\n\n**Timing: 12-24 months to reach full operational capability.** **Lead: A nonprofit and international equivalents.**\n\n\n-----\n\nDifferent organizations require different types of information about ransomware attacks to serve a variety of goals.\nCybersecurity providers need technical data about the malware used in the attack to build protections for other\ncustomers, while law enforcement may be interested in other information, such as the wallet number and ransom\nnote. At the same time, reporting can be a significant burden to an organization suffering a ransomware attack.\n\nIn order to reduce the burden of ransomware reporting while increasing its utility for recipients, a standard\nransomware incident report format should be developed through a multi-stakeholder process. Any organization\nreporting a ransomware incident or reporting on behalf of another organization could use this format. The format\nshould encompass both non-technical information (such as affected organization type or ransom amount) and\ntechnical information (such as indicators of compromise). It should also leverage existing formats, such as STIX[71]\nand the MITRE ATT&CK[72] framework for technical data and suspicious activity reports, to make integration across\nreporting systems as easy as possible. The required fields should be kept to a minimum, but the format should\nenable more technically capable reporting entities to include more detailed information. Creating such a standard\nformat would also make aggregating and anonymizing reports easier.\n\n\n**Timing: 6-12 months.** **Lead: \u0007A nonprofit, such as the Institute for Security & Technology or the Cyber Threat**\n_Alliance, and international equivalents._\n\n\n###### Action 4.2.3: Encourage organizations to report ransomware incidents.\n\n\nNational governments should encourage organizations that experience a ransomware attack to report the\nincident to the RIRN using the common format. This encouragement could take the form of the “See Something,\nSay Something” campaign, and would note the benefits of reporting, the low level of effort required, and the\nprotections built into the reporting process (for example, that reports can be made anonymously). The government\nshould use different outreach methods for different parts of the ecosystem, for example, using tailored outreach\nfor K-12 engagement versus engagement with the manufacturing sector.\n\n\n**Timing: 6-12 months, updated ongoing as needed.**\n**Lead: Government cybersecurity agency or cyber center; DHS CISA in the U.S., with support from relevant**\n_government, industry, academia, civil society ransomware experts to craft the message._\n\n\n###### Action 4.2.4: Require organizations and incident response entities to share ransomware payment information with a national government prior to payment.\n\n\nIn the US, 54 states and territories have breach disclosure laws, and many sectors also have federal reporting\nrequirements, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (in the financial sector) and Sarbanes-Oxley (for publicly traded\ncompanies). In the European Union, the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive)\nrequires essential entities to report data breaches. Updating breach disclosure laws to include a ransom payment\ndisclosure requirement would help increase the understanding of the scope and scale of the crime, allow for better\nestimates of the societal impact of these payments, and enable better targeting of disruption activities. Further,\nrequiring ransomware victims to report details about the incident prior to paying the ransom would enable national\ngovernments to take actions such as issuing a freeze letter to cryptocurrency exchanges, as called for in Action\n2.1.4. Finally, publishing summaries of the information reported under this requirement will help organizations\n\n\n-----\n\nThis mandate should require organizations to report directly to a non-regulatory government agency. In turn,\na receiving agency should share the reported information with other appropriate, non-regulatory government\nagencies as rapidly as possible and, after appropriate anonymization, to the RIRN. To reduce the burden on\nvictim organizations, the mandatory report should only encompass limited information, such as ransom date,\ndemand, payment instructions (e.g., wallet number and transaction hashes), and amount, and it should use\nthe standard reporting format developed through Action 4.2.2. However, the reporting process should allow\norganizations to provide additional technical information about the incident when they can, and use insurance\nproviders or incident response entities to report on their behalf. In order to avoid forcing organizations to\nput themselves in potential regulatory jeopardy, the reporting requirement should incorporate limited liability\nprotections, including that the report cannot form the basis for a regulatory or other enforcement action. When\nenacting this mandate, governments should consider appropriate penalties for organizations that do not comply\nwith the requirement.\n\n\n**Timing: 12-24 months.** **Lead: U.S. Federal government, and international equivalents.**\n\n\n###### Objective 4.3:  Require organizations to consider alternatives to paying ransoms\n\n\n###### While most leaders oppose the idea of paying ransoms and only reluctantly agree to make a payment, they may arrive at the decision based on limited information. A common misperception is that the only alternative to payment is entirely rebuilding the network; that option might be prohibitively costly or take too long for organizations that have critical services that need immediate restoration. However, in many cases, viable alternatives exist between payment and a full network rebuild, such as restoring data from unencrypted shadow copies. Finally, a small minority of organizations might assume that paying the ransom will be the easiest path to restoring operations and may not otherwise review their alternatives.\n\n Requiring organizations to analyze options before paying ransoms could enable more organizations to choose alternative paths. However, even if governments choose not to make these recommendations mandatory, they should still be incorporated as best practices in the Ransomware Framework developed under Action 3.1.1.\n\n\n###### Action 4.3.1: Require organizations to review alternatives before making payments.\n\n\nAlthough ransomware attackers often try to use time pressure to try to persuade victims to pay, often other\noptions are available. Unencrypted shadow copies of data might be accessible, allowing a victim to recover their\nbusiness operations, or a decryption key might exist for that particular ransomware. If ransomware victims have a\nlegal requirement to conduct a due diligence review before making a payment, then they would have the ability to\npush back on demands for immediate payment. This review would also reveal whether options between payment\nand rebuilding the network from scratch are viable. For example, the mandate could require organizations to\nconsult with initiatives like No More Ransom to determine if their information can be decrypted without paying.\n\nSuch reviews should be scaled to the size and criticality of the organization; for SMBs, the review might only\nconsist of two or three actions. If more organizations actively seek alternatives to payment, fewer will feel\n\n\n-----\n\ncompelled to pay. National governments should enact a legal requirement for conducting the review; in the U.S.\ncontext, the private sector should develop what constitutes the due diligence review as part of the cost-benefit\nanalysis matrix in Action 4.3.3.\n\n\n**Timing: 12-24 months.** **Lead: U.S. Federal government and international equivalents.**\n\n\nIn addition to searching for payment alternatives, organizations should also compare the costs of paying the\nransom with those of not paying. Given the complexities involved, the costs associated with either option are not\nnecessarily obvious without analysis. Many costs will be incurred regardless of whether or not an organization\npays the ransom; for example, a company will be liable for breach notification costs regardless of whether the\nattacker upholds their promise not to further release the data if the ransom is paid. Consequently, such costs\nshould not factor into the decision. In many cases, the analysis could show that paying the ransom is not in fact\nthe cheaper option.\n\nThe Task Force recommends that national governments require organizations to conduct a cost-benefit analysis\nprior to making a ransom payment. Such statutes could also require medium- to large enterprises to document\nthis cost-benefit analysis prior to making a payment or authorizing their insurance provider to make a payment on\ntheir behalf. Once a standard cost-benefit analysis matrix is developed, as called for in Action 4.3.3, governments\ncould require the use of the standard matrix to facilitate inter-organization comparisons and data collection.\n\n\n**Timing: 12-24 months Lead.** **Lead: U.S. Federal government and international equivalents.**\n\n\n###### Action 4.3.3: Develop a standard cost-benefit analysis matrix.\n\n\nAs noted in 4.3.2, analyzing the costs associated with a payment decision can prove challenging. Many\norganizations would benefit from having a standard analytic matrix to carry out this task. However, most existing\ndecision guides do not explicitly tackle this question and clearly lay out the various cost factors. Therefore, the\nTask Force recommends that the Ransomware Framework called for in Action 3.1.1 specifically include a costbenefit matrix. This matrix should enable organizations to identify the costs associated with not paying compared\nto the costs of paying the ransom, as well as which costs to exclude from the analysis because they are incurred in\neither case.\n\n\n**Timing: 12-24 months.** **Lead: NIST for the US, and international equivalents, with private sector participation**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe question of whether to prohibit payment of ransoms has become increasingly pressing, and was\nraised by every working group in the Task Force. The argument in favor of a ransom ban holds that\nransomware is primarily motivated by profit, and if the potential for a payout is removed, attackers\nwill shift away from this tactic. A further argument is that ransom profits are used to fund other, more\npernicious crime, such as human trafficking, child exploitation, terrorism, and creation of weapons\nof mass destruction. When viewed with that lens, the case for prohibiting payments is clear.\n\nThe challenge comes in determining how to make such a measure practical, as there remains a lack\nof organizational cybersecurity maturity across sectors, sizes of organization, and geographies.\nRansomware attackers require little risk or effort to launch attacks, so a prohibition on ransom\npayments would not necessarily lead them to move into other areas. Rather, they would likely continue\nto mount attacks and test the resolve of both victim organizations and their regulatory authorities.\nTo apply additional pressure, they would target organizations considered more essential to society,\nsuch as healthcare providers, local governments, and other custodians of critical infrastructure.\n\nWere a government to take a hardline approach on non-payment, perhaps even offering to shore\nup victims in their jurisdiction in some manner, attackers will look for other potential targets before\nmoving to new sources of revenue. This means they will focus on countries or sectors where\ngovernments have not implemented the same policy or are unable to provide a safety net for victims.\nEven in jurisdictions that offer support for critical entities, organizations that do not qualify for this\nsupport may instead pay the ransom without disclosing the incident. This could then open them\nto further extortion.\n\nAs such, any intent to prohibit payments must first consider how to build organizational cybersecurity\nmaturity, and how to provide an appropriate backstop to enable organizations to weather the initial\nperiod of extreme testing. Ideally, such an approach would also be coordinated internationally to\navoid giving ransomware attackers other avenues to pursue.\n\nWith all these pragmatic considerations in mind, the Ransomware Task Force did not reach\nconsensus on prohibiting ransom payments, though we do agree that payments should be\ndiscouraged as far as possible. We recognize, though, that some governments may want to\npursue ransomware payment prohibitions based on their policy judgments. Given the potential\nconsequences, the Task Force has identified three factors that governments should consider\nto reduce the negative impacts of such prohibitions:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe Ransomware Task Force developed the recommendations outlined in this report to provide\na multi-pronged approach to countering ransomware, and it will be crucial for organizations\nacross sectors to work together and act immediately to tackle this challenge. Make no mistake:\nreducing the ransomware threat will not be easy, and it will not be accomplished by any individual\ngovernment or organization alone; this effort will require coordination, collaboration, and investment\nof time and resources.\n\nThe persistence of safe harbors and the challenge of tracing transactions through cryptocurrencies,\ncombined with the complexity of attribution and prosecution, stack the odds in ransomware\ncriminals’ favor. The old adage that a cybercriminal only has to be lucky once, while a defender\nhas to be lucky every minute of every day, has never been more true. Without major intervention,\nthe situation will only get worse as ransomware criminals continue to evolve their tactics and the\nproliferation of devices through the “internet of things” dramatically expands the attack surface. The\never-more lucrative ransomware industry will draw in more threat actors, compounding the problem.\n\nAdding to the challenge, victims of ransomware attacks may increasingly worry about reputational\nharm and be wary of disclosing details to the public. It is also likely that, as efforts to reduce\nransomware become more successful, actors may choose to target increasingly critical systems and\nnetworks, and adopt techniques that are more aggressive in order to combat increased defenses or\npayment obstruction techniques.\n\nYet failing to act is not an option. Allowing the ransomware challenge to go unchecked could have\ndisastrous consequences. Ransomware actors will only become more malicious, and worsening\nattacks will inevitably impact critical infrastructure, including communications, transportation, health\nand safety, distribution and logistics, utilities, and other critical infrastructure. Future attacks could\neasily combine techniques in ways that cause the infections to spread beyond their intended targets,\npotentially leading to far-reaching consequences, including loss of life.\n\nThe good news is that many of the recommendations outlined in this report may help improve\norganizations’ cybersecurity broadly, and lead to the establishment of new collaborations dedicated\nto keeping our digital society safe. Indeed, we are still at the dawn of the digital age, and finding new\nways to address ransomware and other cyber threats will have benefits that last for decades to come.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Summary of Recommendations\n\n\n_Action 2.1.1: \u0007_ _\u0007_ _\u0007Develop new levers for voluntary sharing of cryptocurrency payment indicators_\n\n_Action 2.1.2:_ _\u0007 \u0007 \u0007Require cryptocurrency exchanges, crypto kiosks, and over-the-counter (OTC) trading “desks” to comply with_\n_existing laws_\n\n_Action 2.1.3:_ _\u0007 \u0007 \u0007 Incentivize voluntary information sharing between cryptocurrency entities and law enforcement_\n\n_Action 2.1.4:_ _\u0007 \u0007 \u0007 Centralize expertise in cryptocurrency seizure, and scale criminal seizure processes_\n\n_Action 2.1.5:_ _\u0007 \u0007 \u0007 Improve civil recovery and asset forfeiture processes by kickstarting insurer subrogation_\n\n_Action 2.1.6:_ _\u0007 \u0007 \u0007 Launch a public campaign tying ransomware tips to existing anti-money laundering whistleblower award_\n_programs_\n\n_Action 2 17:_ _Establish an insurance-sector consortium to share ransomware loss data and accelerate best practices_\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe Institute for Security and Technology is incredibly grateful to the phenomenal group of volunteer\nexperts that came together to make this effort a success. The communities that operate day in and\nday out to grapple with challenges like ransomware comprise countless unsung heroes, and we are\nlucky to have been able to convene such a diverse and expansive group of dedicated professionals.\nThey graciously shared considerable amounts of their very limited time to provide their expertise and\nwork through proposed solutions as part of the three-month sprint of the Ransomware Task Force.\nAll of this took place during a period of significant high-level responsibilities across the industry.\n\nOur effort consisted of four main working groups, with an additional three special projects teams,\nsupplemented by numerous sub-working groups focused on everything from cryptocurrencies to “pizza\nparties” to cyber insurance. The Task Force consisted of members from civil society, private industry\n(from a range of sectors, including finance, cybersecurity, insurance, healthcare, and high technology),\nas well as members of government agencies from the United States and around the world.\n\nWe want to say a particular word of thanks to the RTF Working Group Co-Chairs, who poured an\nextraordinary amount of time and energy into organizing and leading large groups of experts,\nfacilitating what were often lively and healthy debates, developing and formulating complicated\nrecommendations, and lending their own extensive knowledge to the entire project. Their leadership\nelevated the process and this resulting report, and we cannot thank them enough.\n\nWe would also like to thank the many members of the Ransomware Task Force and their\norganizations, which afforded them the opportunity during otherwise exceedingly demanding times.\nThey answered this call to action with dedication and their substantial expertise. We appreciate the\nresources that each of them brought to the table and the professional connections they have tapped\ninto in order to move the process along and thoroughly vet our proposed solutions.\n\nLastly, we would like to thank the many unnamed people outside of the Task Force who answered our\nmany questions, discussed ideas, and gave feedback on our recommendations.\n\nWe believe the recommendations in this report, if undertaken together and with alacrity, could lead to\nreal change in the trajectory of this threat.

While\nthere are various types of insurance available that may cover losses associated with ransomware, including\nproperty insurance, kidnap and ransom insurance, and errors and omissions insurance, most insured\nransomware losses are covered by “affirmative” or “stand-alone” cyber insurance. “Affirmative” refers to\nexplicit cyber coverage within the text of an insurance policy; “stand-alone” refers to a dedicated insurance\npolicy for cyber risk, instead of cyber coverage available within a policy dedicated to other types of risk.\n\nThe first cyber insurance policies were designed to respond to lawsuits arising out of technology errors\nand omissions. As the internet developed, organizations digitized their operations, and as states passed\nlaws related to data breach notification and consumer privacy, cyber insurance firms expanded their\ncoverage to respond to the associated risks of data breach and business interruption. Today, cyber\ninsurance has become a standard part of cyber risk management strategies. Many cyber insurers and\nbrokers offer risk management services, education, and security tools to make their insureds more\nsecure, in addition to the traditional risk transfer of an insurance policy.\n\nWhile many insurance companies actively underwrite cyber risks, the market is led by 20 or so large insurers\nthat write the majority of cyber insurance policies. Less than 15% of organizations globally buy cyber\ninsurance, including about a third of all large companies in the United States. Internationally, the number\nof companies that have cyber insurance tends to be lower. While cyber insurance is growing, it remains\na niche product, and is less than 1% of the size of the greater property and casualty insurance market.[74]\n\nCyber insurance policies typically cover legal, forensic, and technical experts to help ransomware victims\ntake the most effective steps to recover. (See Table 1, Common Components of a Modern Cyber Insurance\nPolicy.) Insurance concentrates this kind of expertise to help victims best orchestrate their options for\nrecovery. Policies may indemnify victims for any business interruption losses and defend them against any\nliability arising out of the event. Cyber insurance policies typically cover expertise to help a victim restore\n\n\n-----\n\nits computer systems from backups and, in the unfortunate circumstances in which the victim has\ndecided it is necessary, expertise to handle a ransom negotiation and effectuate an extortion payment.\nCyber insurance policies never require a victim to pay a ransom. Any decision to pay sits with the victim.\n\n###### TABLE 1: Common Components of a Modern Cyber Insurance Policy\n\n|TYPE OF COVERAGE|PARTY|DETAIL|\n|---|---|---|\n|Incident Response Costs|First|The cost of responding to a data breach event, including IT forensics, external services, and specialists that might be employed; internal response costs; legal costs; and costs related to restoring systems to their preexisting condition.|\n|Data Privacy Liability|Third|The cost of dealing with and compensating third-party individuals whose information is or may have been compromised by a data breach event, including notification, compensation, providing credit-watch services, and other third-party liabilities to affected data subjects.|\n|Data Recovery Costs|First|The cost of reconstituting data and/or software that have been deleted or corrupted.|\n|Business Interruption Loss|First|Lost profits or extra expenses incurred due to the unavailability of IT systems or data as a result of cyber attacks or non-malicious IT failures.|\n|Regulatory Defense|Third|Provides coverage for fines, penalties, and defense costs in the face of regulatory actions investigating violations of privacy law.|\n|Cyber Extortion|First|The cost of extortion response expertise to vet and evaluate all possible options for recovery, and, if required, negotiate and execute any ransom payment.|\n|Multimedia Liability|Third|Defense costs and civil damages arising from defamation, libel, slander, copyright/trademark infringement, negligence in publication of any content in electronic or print media, as well as infringement of the intellectual property of a third party.|\n|Reputational Damage|First|Loss of revenues arising from an increase in customer churn or reduced transaction volumes that can be directly attributed to the publication of a defined security breach event.|\n|Network Liability|Third|Third-party liabilities arising from security events occurring within the organization’s IT network or passing through it in order to attack a third party.|\n|Contingent Business Interruption Loss|First|Costs of business interruption to the insured resulting from the IT failure of a third party, such as a supplier, critical vendor, utility, or external IT services provider.|\n|Technology Errors & Omissions Liability|Third|Coverage for third-party claims relating to failure to provide adequate technical service or technical products and software, including legal costs and expenses of allegations resulting from a cyber attack, error, or IT failure.|\n|Financial Theft and Fraud|First|The direct financial loss suffered by an organization arising from the use of computers to commit fraud or theft of money, securities, or other property.|\n|Physical Asset Damage|First|First-party loss due to the destruction of hardware or other physical property resulting from cyber attacks.|\n\n\n-----\n\nThousands of organizations have used cyber insurance to recover from ransomware attacks,\nincluding hospitals, cities, and schools, through comprehensive coverage and bringing to bear\nheavily vetted ransomware response expertise. Each year, cyber insurers pay out hundreds of\nmillions of dollars in cyber losses claimed by their insureds, including business income losses, data\nrecovery costs, and expert fees arising out of ransomware events.[75] As ransomware has become\nmore frequent and destructive, ransomware losses have increased, impacting both insured and\ninsurer. As a result, a number of insurers have exited the cyber insurance market or reduced their\nparticipation. Firms that remain have invested heavily in their ability to properly assess cyber risk.\nWith approximately $1 trillion in insurance limits exposed, the cyber insurance market is incentivized\nto reduce the risks posed by ransomware.\n\nIn the insurance industry, periods of falling premiums, expanding coverage, and loosening\nunderwriting standards (resulting from increased competition) are referred to as “soft markets,”\nwhereas periods of rising premiums, coverage restrictions, and heightened underwriting standards\n(due to increased underwriting losses) are often referred to as “hard markets.” According to multiple\nreports, cyber insurance has entered a “hard market” phase.[76]\n\nIn a hard market, the insurance industry can push insured organizations to better manage their\nrisk. Competing insurers may do this through rising underwriting standards and risk management\nstrategies, changes to price, and other innovations that align the insured organization’s incentives\ntoward risk management and risk transfer. This trend has been seen with respect to perils as\ndiverse as fire, piracy, hurricane, and kidnap for ransom; in each instance, the insurance sector has\nidentified and supported risk management practices and technologies that have bent the curve\nand ameliorated a significant risk, to the mutual benefit of the insured and the insurer. The cyber\ninsurance market should behave similarly; for example, after the major retail payment card breaches\nof 2013 and 2014, the cyber insurance market pushed compliance with PCI-DSS standards, industry\nstandards promulgated by the payment card industry that establish a base level of payment card\ncybersecurity.\n\n\n###### In a hard market, the insurance industry can push insured organizations to better manage their risk.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Rising Underwriting Standards in Response to Ransomware\n\nThe economics of the cyber insurance industry align with the victims of ransomware. As a result,\nthe industry is incentivized to innovate, evolve, compete, and otherwise increase its expertise to\nprevent insured ransomware losses. As ransomware losses have accelerated, the cyber insurance\nmarket has adapted.\n\n**Improved cyber-defense:**\nThe key adaptation has been investment in underwriting analysis to identify ransomware risk factors\nand developing the expertise to help firms secure themselves appropriately against a ransomware\nattack. Increased scrutiny of prospective insurance buyers is designed to incentivize firms to make\nappropriate security investments and become prepared. To accurately measure a firm’s ransomware\nrisk, cyber insurers are increasingly deploying supplemental ransomware underwriting applications,\nenlisting third-party cybersecurity firms to conduct additional assessments, and carrying out external\nscans of firms’ web-facing assets. Cyber insurers may deploy in-house security and risk engineering\nexpertise to proactively help insured organizations become more resilient in the face of ransomware\nrisk. A number of cyber insurers and insurance brokerage firms have established or acquired\ncybersecurity firms to provide managed threat detection, incident response, or security consulting\nservices to insureds in advance of a loss.\n\n**Market Strategies:**\nAnother adaptation comes from cyber insurers experimenting with different market strategies\nto incentivize organizations to increase their cybersecurity to become secure. These strategies\ninclude sublimits (i.e. reduced claim limits) for ransomware-related coverage; co-insurance (the\njoint assumption of a risk by the insured and insurer); increases in premium; and other changes or\nrequirements in the insurance coverage.[77] Underwriters may refuse to offer insurance coverage\nto organizations that do not first establish an appropriate level of cybersecurity preparedness. For\ninstance, this may mean that an organization must confirm that it follows a recognized cybersecurity\nframework, or that it has deployed multi-factor authentication, or is managing the risks associated\nwith remote access to computer networks. While underwriting firms may defer in certain details,\nthe cyber insurance market is coalescing around certain baseline controls as a prerequisite to\ninsurability.[78] Brokerages and risk management firms have also increased their advisory practices to\nmove organizations toward greater ransomware preparedness and insurability.\n\nOrganizations that lack basic cybersecurity hygiene may be uninsurable, which should spur greater\ninvestment in ransomware defenses. When the market works properly, organizations should be\nincentivized to reach an appropriate mix of insurance and security.[79]\n\n**Process changes:**\nFinally, as a third adaptation, cyber insurance companies have modified many internal processes.\nFor example, some insurers have established close connections with national and global law\nenforcement to facilitate the sharing of data and threat intelligence.[80]\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware payments are typically made in cryptocurrency. As cryptocurrency ownership\nrecords are maintained on the cryptographic ledger of a blockchain, ownership is not easily linked\nto identifiable individuals. Often the money does not flow straight from victim to criminal; it travels\nthrough a multi-step process involving different financial entities, each presenting insights into\ncriminal identities and opportunities for intervention.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 6 Payment Pathway and Potential Intervention Points\n\n RANSOMWARE PAYMENT PATHWAY POTENTIAL INTERVENTION POINTS\n\n|Col1|PREPARE AND RESPOND|\n|---|---|\n||• Prepare.

Law enforcement may engage blockchain analysis firms to investigate parties to cryptocurrency transactions.|\n|---|---|\n\n\n\n- Deter ransomware actors and their sponsors hosts and\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen a victim is hit with a ransomware attack, they may engage one or more incident response entities\nto assist in the process of advising on, and potentially paying, the ransom. These firms include the\nvictim’s cyber-insurance provider (if they have coverage), law firms, negotiation firms, threat intelligence,\nand forensic investigators.\n\nEntities like negotiation firms communicate directly with ransomware threat actors and seek to lower\nthe ransom demand. Other organizations (for example, incident response firms, financial institutions,\netc.) may perform due diligence to ensure a payment would not violate sanctions, identify the extent\nof applicable insurance coverage, and confirm that there is no publicly available decryption key.\nThese firms may also assist the victim with deciding whether or not to pay the ransom.\n\n###### Ransom Payment\n\nIf a victim decides to pay the ransom, either they or an incident response vendor, such as a forensic\ninvestigator or negotiation firm, will need to withdraw funds from a financial institution to purchase\nthe cryptocurrency. This cryptocurrency is then transferred from the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet, a\ndigital storage service, facilitated by a cryptocurrency exchange, a private kiosk, or simply a wallet-towallet transfer to a new wallet address provided by the ransomware criminal. These victim-specific\naddresses are created by the criminal actors for the purpose of receiving the payments. Often\nthese will have never been used before, to avoid being associated with the threat actor’s previous\nactivity, and thus cannot be traced until funds are actually deposited into those wallet addresses\nby the victim. These are generally un-hosted wallets, which means they are not hosted with any\ncryptocurrency exchange that handles and monitors transactions.\n\nCryptocurrencies are outside of any one organization’s control, but their blockchains create public,\npermanent records of activity, whether legal or illicit. Blockchain analysis helps interpret public\nblockchain ledgers and, with the proper tools, government agencies, cryptocurrency businesses, and\nfinancial institutions can understand which real-world entities transact with each other. Blockchain\nanalytic companies, such as Chainalysis and CipherTrace, are able to show that a given transaction took\nplace between two different cryptocurrency exchanges, or between a cryptocurrency exchange and an\nillicit entity, such as a sanctioned individual or organization. With blockchain analysis tools and Know\nYour Customer (KYC) information, law enforcement can gain transparency into blockchain activity.\n\nWhile some illicit actors use privacy coins in an attempt to obfuscate their transactions, this more\nuntraceable form of cryptocurrency has not been adopted as widely as might be expected because\nthey are not as liquid as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Now that many exchanges have delisted\nprivacy coins following guidance from regulators, this payment method is becoming increasingly\nimpractical. Cryptocurrency is only useful if you can buy and sell goods and services or cash out into\nfiat, and that is much more difficult with privacy coins.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter receiving the ransomware payment in the designated digital wallet, the ransomware criminal\noften attempts to obfuscate these funds as quickly as possible to avoid detection and tracking. As\nnoted above, Bitcoin transactions are logged in a public ledger, so without obfuscation, a criminal\ncannot withdraw funds into cash without being tracked. One popular method for obfuscation is to\nroute funds through cryptocurrency mixing services, services that create a series of transactions to\nmix one set of funds with another, muddying the public ledger by mixing in legitimate “traffic” with\nillicit ransomware funds.\n\n###### Cryptocurrency mixing services\n\nCryptocurrency mixing services (often “mixers” or “tumblers”) are commonly used by\nransomware actors and others engaged in illicit activity. As described above, a blockchain is\na record of the source and destination of every transaction. As a result, blockchain analytic\nfirms can trace cryptocurrency transactions, supporting both law enforcement efforts to\nidentify criminals and cryptocurrency exchange efforts to screen clients for links to crime.\nRansomware actors use mixers to try to prevent such tracing by making it difficult to\nidentify the true source of transactions on the blockchain.\n\nMixers can function in multiple ways, but typically they rely upon a group of people coming\ntogether to pool their cryptocurrency (like bitcoin), with each taking back different bitcoins\nof the same value. These different bitcoins they receive will have a different source than the\nones they submitted for “mixing.” This process is typically managed by a centralized mixing\nservice, which charges a fee — often between 1-10% of the amount mixed. Some mixing\nservices take additional steps to complicate and obfuscate the source of funds, including\nintermediate trades with privacy coins such as Monero. There are hundreds of mixing\nservices available on the internet.\n\nAnother method for obfuscation is “chainhopping,” exchanging funds in one cryptocurrency\nfor another. Tracking funds after they switch currencies can be extremely challenging. These\ntransactions can occur at centralized or decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges, which are\ndiscussed further in Step 4, or via atomic swaps and other technical means.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter obfuscating the funds, ransomware criminals may make use of the cryptocurrency, or withdraw\nthe funds into cash. There are several methods for cashing out, including over-the -counter trading\ndesks, crypto kiosks, and exchanges, which are the most prominent. Others include exchanging\nbitcoin for gift/debit cards and or alternative coins, such as privacy coins.\n\nAs noted below criminals may make use of cryptocurrency funds by paying for infrastructure to\nconduct attacks or to pay individuals involved in the criminal organization, such as money launderers\nand affiliates. Criminals also rely on OTC traders to convert the virtual currency to fiat. A market\nexists for these OTC transactions because Russian businesses operating in China prefer to operate in\nBitcoin to avoid taxes, while criminals operating in Russia prefer cash. Therefore, an OTC trader can\nconnect these individuals with Russian businesses accepting Bitcoin and criminals receiving cash\ntransactions inside Russia.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Step 4 cont...\n\n\nCryptocurrency businesses facilitate the trading of cryptocurrency between buyers and sellers.\nRansomware criminals rely on these businesses to exchange their ransomware proceeds for\ndifferent cryptocurrencies or for government-issued currencies. As relatively new financial\ninstitutions, these cryptocurrency businesses exist on a spectrum of legitimacy, regulation, and\ncompliance, and handle varying amounts of transactions with illicit funds. For example, in 2019,\nCoinbase published a report identifying that most exchanges are not in compliance with Anti\nMoney Laundering or Know your Customer procedures.\n\n###### Cryptocurrency businesses generally fall into one of  three categories:\n\n**•** **Regulated Cryptocurrency Exchanges: These are legitimate exchanges with high liquidity**\nthat are able to handle a large number of transactions. In the United States, these exchanges\nare subject to non-bank financial institution anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, which\nrequire some Know Your Customer (KYC) identification of customers performing large\ntransactions, among other requirements. Other jurisdictions impose similar KYC and AML\nrequirements as those in the United States, including the United Kingdom, the European Union,\nJapan, Australia and New Zealand.[82]\n\n**•** **Minimally Regulated Cryptocurrency Exchanges: Located in jurisdictions with less**\nstringent regulatory obligations than the United States and other members of the G7, these\ncryptocurrency exchanges operate with few controls for identifying potential illicit funds. These\nexchanges often serve as one of the preferred services for ransomware criminals to cash out\nillicit funds without oversight. These exchanges include Binance and Huobi, which have much\nless stringent KYC rules, especially when dealing with OTC traders.\n\n**•** **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Cryptocurrency Exchanges (also known as Over-the-Counter or**\nDecentralized Exchanges): Regardless of geographical limits, users can download freelyavailable software or access P2P exchanges to buy and sell cryptocurrency directly with one\nanother. This avoids the use of a third-party service like a “traditional” exchange, which may\nhold user funds in custody, process transactions in fiat currency, and comply with KYC and\nAML requirements.\n\n**•** **Over-The-Counter Trading Desks: Some OTC traders, actors that trade cryptocurrency**\nwithout an exchange acting as a facilitator or mediator of the trade, provide cryptocurrency\nlaundering services to ransomware threat actors. Although many OTC traders maintain\nlegitimate businesses and comply with stringent financial regulations, some do not, and they\nprovide an important source of liquidity for exchanging ransomware payment.\n\nTracking payments is difficult due to the variance in standards and enforcement of regulation\nfor exchanges of different categories, or that operate in different countries. Even using regulated\nexchanges, ransomware actors constantly find new ways to remain hidden by using money mule\nservice providers to set up accounts, or use accounts with false or stolen credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Background\n\nOver the years, many efforts have attempted to formalize the trust networks that are relied on\nto keep the internet operating. Some initiatives have been effective without significant formal\nstructure: the Conficker Working Group, convened by Microsoft in the late 2000s to stop the spread\nand impact of the Conficker worm, is often lauded as an early model. More formal joint collaborative\nefforts have also been successful: the 2020-2021 takedown of Emotet was an example of a long\ncollaborative effort between global law enforcement, judicial authorities, and private industry to\nseize and disrupt a massive global botnet. More often, though, public-private information security\ncollaboration occurs primarily when there is a crisis, as was the case with the Cyber Unified\nCoordination Group (UCG), which the U.S. Government convened in 2021 to focus on the Hafnium\ncase involving vulnerable Microsoft Exchange Servers.\n\nWhat remains elusive is a standing mechanism for convening operationally focused, sustained,\npublic-private campaigns that are coordinated via formal and informal nodes, and that allow for\nboth the formal requirements needed by government and the informal requirements needed by\nindustry. Much has already been written about potential solutions for launching such an initiative,\nincluding Jay Healey’s 2018 article on Cyber Incident Collaboration Organizations,[83] recent work by\nthe Aspen Institute,[84] and recommended solutions from the World Economic Forum’s Partnership\nAgainst Cybercrime.[85] Ransomware presents a unique opportunity to test new approaches, and the\nRansomware Task Force provides below a proposed framework for consideration.\n\n###### Objective\n\nUse operational collaboration to increase the scope, scale, pace, and efficacy of intelligence-driven\ntakedowns and disruption of ransomware operations and the infrastructure and people that enable them.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Assumptions\n\nRansomware actors are intelligently taking advantage of the seams between law enforcement\nand private-sector cooperation mechanisms, and between governmental and private-sector legal\nauthorities. They also move with such alacrity that existing structures cannot respond fast enough\nto disrupt their activities on a sustained, rapid, and concerted basis.\n\nExisting mechanisms are working to address the problem, but they are siloed in various agencies and\nnot leveraging the full authorities and capabilities of all government agencies. They also do not routinely\nincorporate private-sector action, nor do they scale to compete with the agility of the criminals.\n\nThis public-private operational collaboration mechanism should include actors and organizations\nthat are involved in the full gamut of defending against and disrupting ransomware operations. No\nsingle actor or entity is fully capable of disrupting this threat by itself, so public and private actors\nmust come together to assess the threat and coordinate activities across authorities and capabilities.\n\nPrivate-sector participants must recognize Government participants must recognize that\nthat not all government actions will be shared private-sector participants may need to take\nor coordinated with non-government actors actions quickly to protect their customers\ndue to security concerns or to protect sources and fulfill contractual agreements, and may\nand methods. not always be able to coordinate actions with\n\nthe government.\n\nA natural governmental response to this collaboration requirement is to create some kind of formal\nstructure. However, a formal private-public Joint Ransomware Task Force would likely hinder privatesector participation. Past experience has shown that private-sector participants are more likely to\nshare information with the government and take actions to defend their customers in coordination\nwith government through existing informal and indirect channels. The U.S. Government, on the other\nhand, needs formality to function in a joint way; moreover, the need for public accountability requires\nthe government to adhere to formal rules and structures. Departments and agencies, especially those\nwith competing equities, are more likely to work only within their lane of authorities and capabilities\nunless they are required and incentivized to work with each other.\n\nThus a formal government task force paired with existing formal and informal private-sector groups\nin the short-term would build trust and work to develop some early wins. Over time, a combination of\nformal and informal private-sector structures should develop to interface with the government’s Joint\nRansomware Task Force (JRTF), working toward a 24/7 operational collaboration mechanism for a\npublic-private anti-ransomware campaign.\n\nRansomware disruptions will almost always be law enforcement operations at their core. But in\norder to truly disrupt ransomware actors, we must also consider non-law enforcement options and\ncapabilities that can improve defenses, impose costs, or more fully disrupt ransomware operations.\nIn terms of the intelligence needed for such operations, the government and various private-sector\norganizations need each other.\n\n\n-----\n\n**•** Private-sector cybersecurity providers are often best positioned to capture indicators of\ncompromise and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the malicious actors to\ndevelop protections for their customers and understand active campaigns.\n\n**•** Cryptocurrency exchanges and analysis firms are best positioned to understand\nthe flow of ransomware payments.\n\n**•** Government agencies, especially in law enforcement and the Intelligence Community, are\nbest positioned to identify the individuals behind the activity.\n\n**•** All of these intelligence perspectives must be shared, combined, and understood in order to\ndevelop the best possible disruption options.\n\nU.S. Government personnel working with the private sector in a given campaign must be\nempowered and incentivized by their leadership to engage with the private sector and take\naction based on what they learn. They should also anticipate the needs of private-sector\npartners and share information that will lead to disruptions.\n\n**To achieve this increased level of operational collaboration, the Ransomware Task Force**\n**recommends the following:**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Recommendations\n\n**1.** The U.S. Government should establish the Joint Ransomware Task Force (JRTF) consisting of\nrepresentatives from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA; the FBI; United\nStates Secret Service; the Intelligence Community; U.S. Cyber Command; the Departments of\nTreasury, Justice, and State; the Office of the National Cyber Director; and other departments\nand agencies as appropriate. The JRTF’s mission should be to prioritize ransomware disruption\noperations and leverage the intelligence-driven disruption planning process to increase the pace\nand efficacy of ransomware takedowns and disruption. The Departments of Homeland Security,\nJustice, and Defense should jointly provide the resources needed to establish and operate the\nTask Force, such as office space, IT infrastructure, and other supplies. The Task Force should\ncoordinate closely with the Joint Cyber Planning Office in CISA, the National Cyber Investigative\nJoint Task Force (NCIJTF), and other inter-agency cyber-related groups. The NSC-led Interagency\nWorking Group recommended in 1.2.1 of the main RTF report would provide direction, priorities,\nand oversee the JRTF. The goals of the JRTF should be to:\n\n    - Prioritize intelligence-driven operations to disrupt specific ransomware actors;\n\n    - \u0007Incentivize and empower government agencies and personnel to participate in joint\noperations in the interagency and with private-sector partners and take action; and\n\n    - Anticipate the needs and requests of the private sector\n\n\u0007The Administration could create such a Task Force through executive action, just as the Bush\nAdministration created the NCIJTF through National Security Policy Directive-54/Homeland\nSecurity Policy Directive-23. The JRTF could be a stand-alone entity, or as U.S. government cyber\norganizations continue to mature and evolve, it could be folded into an existing organization, such\nas the Joint Cyber Planning Office, the National Cyber Director’s office, or the NCIJTF.\n\n**2. An existing non-profit organization should establish a private-sector Ransomware Threat Focus**\nHub. The participants should include cybersecurity providers, non-profit sharing organizations,\ncyber threat intelligence firms, threat intelligence researchers and contractors, incident response\nfirms, managed security service providers, telecommunications companies, major platform owners/\noperators, and hosting providers. The Hub would facilitate and coordinate sustained private-sector\nactions against an agreed-upon target list, in coordination with the JRTF. The hosting non-profit\norganization, such as an information-sharing and analysis organization (ISAO), would provide space\nfor information sharing and operational collaboration between participants.[86] Formal and informal\ncoordination could occur within this Hub, and the Hub would encourage informal and formal groups\nto work together in tandem. Informal groups would continue to work and collaborate as they do\ntoday, while the formal layer would focus on long-term, permanent arrangements with the U.S. or\nother governments.\n\n**The RTF recommends the following general tasks for the JRTF and the RTFH:**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Proposed JRTF Tasks\n\n**1.** Establish a “target list” of the top 10\nransomware threats, in consultation with\nthe private-sector hub, updated on an\nongoing basis, to:\n\n**a. Identify and prioritize targets for**\nthreat cells, focused on specific\nransomware actors/conglomerates;\n**b. Identify a timeline for the operation;**\nand\n**c.** Identify metrics for success.\n\n**2.** Disrupt criminal actors, associated\ninfrastructure, and their finances.\n\n**3.** Enable private-sector representatives\nto move against ransomware actors and\ninfrastructure with rapid legal authority\n(e.g. court orders) when necessary to\ntake required actions.\n\n\n**4.** Enable the private sector to tip and cue\nlaw enforcement, network defenders,\nintelligence community, and, where\nnecessary, U.S. military action.\n\n**5.** Collect, share, and analyze ransomware\ntrends to inform campaigns.\n\n**6.** Create “after action reports” that identify\nsuccesses and failures in an operation\nto improve subsequent operations.\n\n**7.** Use non-traditional tools, such as\ninformation and influence operations,\nthrough online forums or a dedicated\nweb portal\n\n\n###### Proposed Ransomware Threat Focus Hub Tasks:\n\n\n**1.** Provide input to the JRTF’s top 10\ntarget list.\n\n**2.** Take synchronized actions against\ncriminal actors, associated\ninfrastructure, and financial operations,\nbased on participants’ legal authority.\n\n**3.** Enable government-sector\nrepresentatives to target and disrupt\nransomware actors and infrastructure\nmore rapidly.\n\n\n**4.** Collect, share, and analyze ransomware\ntrends to inform counter-ransomware\ncampaigns.\n\n**5.** Create “after action reports” from the\nprivate-sector point of view that identify\nsuccesses and failures in each operation\nto improve subsequent operations.\n\n**6.** Use non-traditional tools, such as\ninformation and influence operations, via\nonline forums, a dedicated web portal, or\nother means.\n\n\n-----\n\n**AG** Attorney General\n\n**ALATs** Assistant Legal Attachés\n\n**APAC** Asia-Pacific\n\n**Atomic Swaps** A smart contract technique that allows the quick exchange of two different\ncryptocurrencies, running on distinct blockchain networks, without using\ncentralized intermediaries.\n\n**AML** Anti-Money Laundering\n\n**CCIPS** Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\n\n**CDNs** Content Delivery Networks\n\n\n**Centralized**\n**Cryptocurrency**\n**Exchange (CEX)**\n\n\nOnline platforms that are used to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.
