As part of these efforts, our teams\nroutinely disrupt adversary operations by disabling them, notifying users if they should take\nsteps to protect their accounts, sharing our findings publicly and continuing to improve the\nsecurity of our products.\n\nToday, we’re sharing actions we took against a group of hackers in Iran to disrupt their ability\nto use their infrastructure to abuse our platform, distribute malware and conduct espionage\noperations across the internet, targeting primarily the United States. This group is known in\nthe security industry as [Tortoiseshell, whose activity was previously reported to mainly focus](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/tortoiseshell-apt-supply-chain)\non the information technology industry in the Middle East. In an apparent expansion of\nmalicious activity to other regions and industries, our investigation found them targeting\nmilitary personnel and companies in the defense and aerospace industries primarily in the\nUS, and to a lesser extent in the UK and Europe. This group used various malicious tactics\nto identify its targets and infect their devices with malware to enable espionage.\n\nThis activity had the hallmarks of a well-resourced and persistent operation, while relying on\nrelatively strong operational security measures to hide who’s behind it. Our platform was one\nof the elements of the much broader cross-platform cyber espionage operation and the\n\n\n-----\n\ngroup s activity on Facebook manifested primarily in social engineering and driving people\noff-platform (e.g. email, messaging and collaboration services and websites), rather than\ndirectly sharing the malware itself.\n\nWe identified the following tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by this threat\nactor across the internet:\n\n**Social engineering: In running its highly targeted campaign, Tortoiseshell deployed**\nsophisticated fake online personas to contact its targets, build trust and trick them into\nclicking on malicious links. These fictitious personas had profiles across multiple social\nmedia platforms to make them appear more credible. These accounts often posed as\nrecruiters and employees of defense and aerospace companies from the countries their\ntargets were in. Other personas claimed to work in hospitality, medicine, journalism, NGOs\nand airlines. They leveraged various collaboration and messaging platforms to move\nconversations off-platform and send malware to their targets. Our investigation found that\nthis group invested significant time into their social engineering efforts across the internet, in\nsome cases engaging with their targets for months.\n\n**Phishing and credential theft: This group created a set of tailored domains designed to**\nattract particular targets within the aerospace and defense industries. Among them were fake\nrecruiting websites for particular defense companies. They also set up online infrastructure\nthat spoofed a legitimate US Department of Labor job search site. As part of their phishing\ncampaigns, they spoofed domains of major email providers and mimicked URL-shortening\nservices, likely to conceal the final destination of these links. These domains appeared to\nhave been used for stealing login credentials to the victims’ online accounts (e.g. corporate\nand personal email, collaboration tools, social media). They also appeared to be used to\nprofile their targets’ digital systems to obtain information about people’s devices, networks\nthey connected to and the software they installed to ultimately deliver target-tailored\nmalware.\n\n**Malware: This group used custom malware tools we believe to be unique to their operations,**\nincluding full-featured remote-access trojans, device and network reconnaissance tools and\nkeystroke loggers. Among these tools, they continued to develop and modify their malware\n[for Windows known as Syskit, which they’ve used for years. They also shared links to](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/tortoiseshell-apt-supply-chain)\nmalicious Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, which enabled malware to perform various system\ncommands to profile the victim’s machine in a manner very similar to the Liderc\n[reconnaissance tool identified by researchers at Cisco. One previously unreported variant of](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/09/tortoiseshell-fake-veterans.html)\nthe malicious tool was embedded in a Microsoft Excel document and was capable of writing\nthe output (i.e. result of the system reconnaissance) to a hidden area of the spreadsheet,\nwhich presumably required an attacker to social engineer the target to trick them into saving\nand returning the file.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Outsourcing malware development: We ve observed this group use several distinct**\nmalware families. Our investigation and malware analysis found that a portion of their\nmalware was developed by Mahak Rayan Afraz (MRA), an IT company in Tehran with ties to\nthe Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Some of the current and former MRA\nexecutives have links to companies sanctioned by the US government.\n\nWe shared our findings and threat indicators with industry peers so they too can detect and\nmitigate this activity. To disrupt this operation, we blocked malicious domains from being\nshared on our platform, took down the group’s accounts and notified people who we believe\nwere targeted by this threat actor.\n\n## Threat Indicators\n\n**Domains:**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n1st smtp2go[.]email\n2nd-smtp2go[.]email\n3rd-smtp2go[.]email\n4th-smtp2go[.]email\naccounts[.]cam\nactivesessions[.]me\nadobes[.]software\nalhds[.]net\napppure[.]cf\nbahri[.]site\nbbcnews[.]email\nbitly[.]cam\nbiturl[.]cx\nbrdcst[.]email\ncareeronestop[.]site\ncc-security-inc[.]email\nccsecurity-mail-inc[.]email\nccsecurity-mail-inc[.]services\ncitymyworkday[.]com\ncityofberkeley[.]support\ncnbcnews[.]email\ncnnnews[.]global\ncodejquery-ui[.]com\ncom-account-challenge[.]email\ncom-signin-v2[.]email\ncomlogin[.]online\ncomlogin[.]services\ncopyleft[.]today\ncrisiswatchsupport[.]shop\ndatacatch[.]xyz\ndayzim[.]org\ndh135[.]world\ndollrealdoll[.]com\ndollrealdoll[.]online\nentrust[.]work\nerictrumpfundation[.]com\nfacebookservices[.]gq\nfblogin[.]me\nfileblade[.]ga\nfindcareersatusbofa[.]com\nfiservcareers[.]com\ngoodreads[.]rest\ngoogl[.]club\ngropinggo[.]com\nhex6mak5z98nubb9vpd6t36cydkncfci9im872qx6hjci2egx8irq3qyt9pj[.]online\nhike[.]studio\nhiremilitaryheroes[.]com\nhosted-microsoft[.]com\niemail[.]today\nincognito[.]today\ninfoga[.]cam\niqtel[.]org\nirtreporter[.]com\nitiee[.]life\nitieee[.]life\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\njessicamcgill[.]life\njqueryui-code[.]com\njumhuria[.]com\nkartick[.]net\nkaspersky[.]team\nlinkgen[.]me\nlinksbit[.]com\nlinq[.]ink\nliveleak[.]cam\nliveuamap[.]live\nlockheedmartinjobs[.]us\nloginaccount[.]email\nlogonexchangeonline[.]com\nlogonmicrosoftonline[.]com\nlskjirn[.]life\nmail2go[.]live\nmail2go[.]online\nmail2u[.]live\nmailaccountlive[.]email\nmailaccountlive[.]support\nmailpublisher[.]live\nmails[.]center\nmetacafe[.]live\nmicorsoftonilne[.]com\nmicorsoftonline[.]website\nmicorsoftonline[.]xyz\nmicrosoftoffice[.]systems\nmicrosoftonilne[.]cloud\nmispace[.]cam\nmsol[.]live\nmsonline[.]live\nmssecurityaccount[.]online\nmydomainxyz[.]xyz\nnews-smtp2go[.]email\nnewsl[.]ink\nnoreplay[.]email\nnovafile[.]tk\nonpointcorp[.]co\noutlook-services[.]com\noutlookservices[.]live\noutlookservices[.]me\noutube[.]live\npic-shareonline[.]com\npixlr[.]live\npixlr[.]myftp[.]org\npost-jquery[.]com\nprefiles[.]ml\npublicsgroupe[.]net\npwutc[.]live\nrali[.]live\nrecruitme[.]international\nrobotics[.]land\nsabic[.]work\nsandsngo[.]com\nsaudivisions2030[.]org\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nsecurityaccountreply[.]com\nseery[.]online\nsendblaster[.]org\nsender[.]gb[.]net\nshareae[.]cf\nshlink[.]run\nshlnk[.]run\nshort-l[.]link\nshortli[.]live\nshrt[.]rip\nshur[.]live\nshurl[.]site\nsite1[.]life\nsmtp-2go[.]com\nsmtp2go[.]best\nsmtp2go[.]club\nsmtp2go[.]email\nsmtp2go[.]fun\nsmtp2go[.]icu\nsmtp2go[.]live\nsmtp2go[.]me\nsmtp2go[.]pw\nsmtp2go[.]site\nsmtp2go[.]space\nsmtp2go[.]website\nsmtper[.]center\nsmtptogo[.]pw\nsoc-usa[.]email\nsoundcloud[.]fun\nsoundcloud[.]live\nspreadme[.]international\nsrc-ymlang[.]link\nsupport-securitymail[.]email\nsupport-ymail-team[.]online\nsurl[.]ist\nsurl[.]live\nsxk8xrjtaikv3dxl7hgghw3vptvxpzzxeynrcltu4k3yeecjq3[.]online\nsystembackend[.]site\ntechmahindra[.]support\nteleweb[.]world\ntetra[.]email\nthegardian[.]ml\nthegaurdian[.]live\nthomsonsreuters[.]email\nthomsonsreuters[.]eu\nthomsonsreuters[.]link\nthomsonsreuters[.]net\ntinil[.]ink\ntinly[.]me\ntinylink[.]pro\ntinyurl[.]gold\ntiwpan[.]xyz\ntox[.]cheap\ntreasury[.]email\ntreporter[.]com\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\ntrumphotel[.]net\ntrumpnationallosangeles[.]email\ntrumporganization[.]world\ntrumporganizations[.]com\ntv-youtube[.]com\nuploaderfile[.]cf\nusdailypost[.]com\nusdailypost[.]net\nusdp[.]news\nvps[.]limited\nwatch-youtube[.]com\nwikileaks[.]email\nworkshopplatform[.]network\nxn--rumphotels-vcc[.]com\nxn--twitte-u9a[.]com\nxyzsitexyz[.]xyz\nymail-account[.]support\nymail-security-support[.]email\nymail-security[.]support\nymailaccounts[.]us\nymailsupport[.]info\nzain[.]network\n\n```\n\n-----",
