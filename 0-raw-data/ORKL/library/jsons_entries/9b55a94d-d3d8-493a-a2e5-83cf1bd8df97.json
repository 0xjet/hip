As illustrated below in figure 1, the end user is\nnotified about a missed voice message from a British Telecom landline. The link directs the\nrecipient to a website that isn’t in any way associated with BT or any other legitimate telecom\nservice.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Initial Email_\n\nOnce this malicious link is accessed, the recipient is directed to the landing page seen in\nfigure 2. This page purports to be the BT sign-in page, spoofing the BT logo and reminding\nthe recipient of their missed messages. One minor detail worth noting is that the number of\nvoice messages pending has changed from one to three. This is likely due to the same mass\nphishing mail being sent out with the parameter of one voice message, and the pre-set\nHTML code in the phishing page being set to three. A slight oversight on the part of the\nthreat actor, but the page remains convincing, nevertheless.\n\nOnce the recipient has entered their details, this information is exfiltrated to an external\nprivate address. As is observable from the URL bar of figure 2, the corresponding URL could\nhardly be more clearly not the BT sign-in page.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Landing Page_\n\nAs with many phishing landing pages, regardless of the details entered, the page will redirect\nback to the target companies’ home page. This event campaign is no different. Once\ncredentials are entered and data stolen, the recipient is directed straight to the official BT\nhelp page. This is done to boost perceptions of “legitimacy.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: BT Homepage_\n\n_Figure 4: Landing Page as it stands_\n\nMissed voice messages as a phishing tactic continues to be a trend, leads to one conclusion:\nA high success rate. The landing page or provider will change depending on the targeted\nregion but one thing remains certain. The tactic will continue in tandem with the threat actor\nsuccess.\n\nCofense is here to help with our analysts and technology to enable users to quickly identify\nvalidated or newly observed threats.
