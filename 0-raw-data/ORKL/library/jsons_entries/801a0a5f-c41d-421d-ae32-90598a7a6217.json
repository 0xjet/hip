By the first half of 2019, we found that the group was able to zero in on specific industries in Japan from which it could steal proprietary information and classified data. We named this campaign “Operation ENDTRADE,” based on its targets.\n\n Analysis of their attacks revealed that they have come up with new malware families capable of evading detection, obfuscation, and escalation of administrative privileges for subsequent attacks to go along with the deployment of previously used malware and modified tools. They have also incorporated techniques and mechanisms for detecting specific cybersecurity products and processes, as well as attempt to terminate a Trend Micro product’s process. Further, the use of legitimate email accounts and credentials to deliver the malware payload, as well as language targeting to increase the accuracy of malware delivery, makes it more effective against unprepared targets. The combination of these schemes — especially when they are continuously refined — could significantly affect the sectors identified as potential victims. It could also endanger people, turning it into an issue of safety.\n\n This research paper provides technical details and analysis based on our observation of Operation ENDTRADE.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Introduction\n\nTICK (a.k.a. “BRONZE BUTLER” or “REDBALDKNIGHT”) is a cyberespionage group known for its supply\n\nchain attacks and use of different malware families to attack organizations across different sectors such\n\nas defense, aerospace, satellite communications, and retail industries, as well as industrial chemical\n\ncompanies. Trend Micro has been observing this group’s operations from as early as 2008, including\n\nits use of social engineering attacks commonly written in fluent Japanese following their usual target\n\nvictims’ affiliations.\n\n**First observation**\n**of the actual**\n**attack**\n\n**First observation** **Massive spear** **Massive spear**\n**of new tool** **phishing campaign** **phishing campaign**\n**development** **occurred** **occurred**\n\n**JAN** **FEB** **MAR** **APR** **MAY** **JUN** **JUL** **AUG**\n\nABK Lilith Avenger\n\nBBK build_down down_new\n\ndoc_ll Pretender Casper\n\nHidefloder\n\nFigure 1. Operation ENDTRADE’s timeline of activities, malware development, and deployment\n\nTowards the end of 2018, we noticed TICK using and adjusting their preferred malware families (such as\n\nXXMM and DATPER) to become more efficient. We then started following their activities and found that\n\nthe group was developing new malware and participating in a series of illicit activities even during attacks.\n\nThe group has also removed the known signatures of its previously used malware routines and families,\n\nand adjusted their respective structures.\n\n|First of ne deve|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|aign|M p o|Col10|Col11|ar paign|Col13|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||First ob of the a attack|servation ctual|||||||||\n||||||||||||||\n||First of ne deve|obs w t lop|ervation ool ment||M ph oc|assive spear ishing camp curred|aign||M p o|assive spe hishing cam ccurred|ar paign||\n||||||||||||||\n|JAN AB B doc_ll||||||||JUN Aveng _new asper||JUL er|AUG||\n|||FEB K BK Prete||MAR build_ nder Hidefloder||APR Lil down|||||||\n\n\n-----\n\nWe observed actual attacks, which used lateral phishing, in January 2019. Numerous emails were then\n\nsent to a number of organizations from one legitimate hijacked Japanese enterprise email address between\n\nmid-February and mid-April. In May, another round of emails were sent to a number of organizations from\n\nanother legitimate email address. We have since referred to TICK’s activities as “Operation ENDTRADE,”\n\nbased on these activities.\n\nWe also observed that the new malware families the group uses were capable of checking if infected\n\nsystems are running specific antivirus products from known cybersecurity vendors such as Qihoo 360,\n\nMcAfee, Symantec, and Trend Micro. The result of which will be implemented in the C&C callback\n\nparameter.\n\nThe new malware family also scans the operations systems’ (OS) code pages to check if it is in Japanese\n\nor Chinese, which would indicate that targets are located in these specific countries. Some of the targeted\n\ncompanies with headquarters in Japan and subsidiaries in China confirmed that attack attempts were\n\nobserved during specific periods.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Notable Features of Operation ENDTRADE\n\n##### Spear phishing for malware delivery\n\nTICK crafted and sent spear phishing emails to deliver malicious payloads to the victims’ networks, notably\n\nin Japanese and in the context of the Chinese economy. The emails had the following characteristics:\n\n- They were sent from legitimate email addresses, likely the result of a lateral phishing scheme\n\n- They were written in correct Japanese\n\n- They were disguised as if they were legitimate reports and prompted users to open the attachments\n\n- Many of the emails contained subject topics related to “salary rate increase” or “job market”\n\nPrior to sending these emails, TICK attacked a Japanese economic research company and a PR agency\n\nand stole email credentials from both organizations. These email addresses were then used to send the\n\nspear phishing emails, prompting potential victims to open the attachments. The attachments had the\n\nfollowing characteristics:\n\n- Drop/download the payload while opening the Japanese documents (hereon referred to as decoy files)\n\n- Decoy files appeared as normal documents from banks, PR companies, or economic organizations\n\n- The payload scans the system to identify any installed antivirus products. It then attempts to terminate\n\nTrend Micro’s antivirus processes, or at least flag the callback traffic to identify the location of the\n\ntargeted system\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Spear phishing sample in correct Japanese\n\n\nFigure 3. Japanese documents on the Chinese economy, dated June 25, 2019.\n\n\nFigure 2. Spear phishing sample in correct Japanese\n\n\n-----\n\n##### New malware families\n\nWe observed TICK actively targeting victims with a variety of methods and techniques around December\n\n2018, adding more malware families as they launched new campaigns. We learned that they developed\n\nnew tools that try to detect antivirus products and attempt to terminate Trend Micro’s antivirus product.\n\nWe named them based on their characteristic program database (PDB) strings:\n\n- Two new downloaders named ABK and BBK\n\n- Two new Trojans named Snake and build_down\n\nFigure 4. Code that terminates specific antivirus’ process\n\n\n###### ABK\n\n\n###### BBK Avenger\n\n\n###### Tomato\n\n\n###### build_downer\n\n\n###### down_new\n\n\n###### Snake\n\n\nFigure 5. Combination of all the downloaders\n\nFurther analysis showed two additional malware families in the network. Naming them down_new and\n\n_Avenger, we learned that these downloaders combine features of previous malware families and inherit_\n\nefficient modules and features from ABK, BBK, Snake and build_down into their final downloaders. All of\n\nthem have one important task: Connect to a website and verify the victim system’s volume serial number\n\nto determine if it will send the command to download the backdoor. In the instance of multiple drives or\n\nvolumes, the downloaders collect information from drive C.\n\n\n-----\n\n{masked}EXE.pdf\n\n\nFortiAvat.exe\n\n**3**\n\nEXE\n\nHash host volume info\nand verify with C2 **C2C2**\n\n**2** Execute and Usually is a\nconnect to C2 legitimate site\n\n**4**\n\nDownload encrypted backdoor and use AES decrypt the backdoor\n\nschost.exe\n\n**7**\n\nEXE **C2**\n\nConnect to C2\n\nFigure 6.

Attack chain of Avenger\n\n##### Exploiting vulnerabilities\n\nIn early 2019, TICK began implementing techniques that exploit vulnerabilities CVE-2018-0802 and\n\nCVE-2018-0798 into their new downloaders ABK and BBK. The two referenced vulnerabilities are both\n\ncategorized as Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in MS Equation Editor, which can be\n\nexploited for remote code execution (RCE) via stack buffer overflows. From the sample we obtained,\n\n_svcdst.exe was the ABK downloader._\n\nxxx.doc 8.t.winhelp.wll svchdst.exe Usually is a legitimate site\n\n|Col1|xxx.doc|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||DOC||\n||DOC||\n||||\n\n|Col1|DLL|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||DLL||\n||||\n\n|Col1|EXE 4|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||EXE||\n|||4|\n\n\n**1** Use\nCVE-2018-0802\nto drop\n\n\n**2** Execute and drop\nmain downloader\n\n\n**3** Add itself to\nregistry and\ndetect AV\n\n\nHash host volume\ninfo and verify\nwith C2\n\n\nFigure 9. Exploiting CVE-2018-0802 and CVE-2018-0798 for downloader’s deployment\n\nHowever, it appeared as if the group ceased the use of both security flaws as they were considered too\n\ncommon and old, especially after considering that a number of cybersecurity companies already carried\n\nupdates and solutions to address them. While these attacks were occurring, we also found another\n\ndropper tool in development called docdll, found as\n\n- c:\\users\\jack\\desktop\\0211\\doc_dll\\release\\docdll.pdb\n\n- c:\\users\\jack\\desktop\\test_dll\\doc_dll\\release\\docdll.pdb\n\n\n-----\n\n_Sample Indicator of Compromise_\n\nc315e18e01abdb50117c3e1e140a1bddf8fcf11ec47830ea926c00d6ff1632a2 [TrojanSpy.Win32.BROLER.A](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/TrojanSpy.Win32.BROLER.A)\n\n##### Decoy documents and language targeting\n\nTICK developed executable files masked with document file icons such as PDF and Word, acting as\n\ndroppers to drop or execute downloaders and other decoy files. For example, in 2019 they developed\n\ndroppers named _Pretender,_ _hidder,_ _HideFloder, and_ _exetodoc. While executable files with document_\n\nfile icons have been in use for at least 10 years, it remains an effective tool especially for advanced\n\npersistent threat (APT) targets. Combined with a legitimate email address and catchy file name, users can\n\nabsentmindedly click on the file.\n\nWe listed samples of the decoy files that TICK used, all of which appeared as legitimate documents\n\nfrom banks or research institutes. We have chosen to withhold the contents of the decoy files, but they\n\ngenerally appeared to have been stolen ahead of the attacks and have the following features:\n\n- Targeted recipients and companies are interested in the Chinese economy\n\n- Targeted recipients’ and companies’ languages are Japanese or Chinese\n\nTo increase decoy emails’ and attachments’ chances of being opened, deciphering the organization’s\n\nnative language becomes an integral aspect of the pre-attack phase.\n\nThe files’ topics appeared to be carefully chosen to appeal to the individuals and organizations with special\n\ninterests in China, such as the US-China economic and trade issues in 2018, or key words pertaining to\n\n“salary rate increase” or “job market” for offices with subsidiaries in China. And while TICK has been known\n\nto target Japanese agencies and industries in the past, these attacks specifically went after companies’\n\nsubsidiaries or those with joint venture firms in China as initial entry points. These attacks may have also\n\nbeen related to past spear phishing campaigns in the region, or a continuation of previous attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the dates identify when the documents were deployed for initial payload delivery. The\n\ndocuments sent out to the targeted organizations may be the same at any point of the identified dates,\n\nbut the malware payloads were changed by TICK. These are just some of the document samples we\n\nacquired for analysis.\n\n|c315e18e01abdb50117c3e1e140a1bddf8fcf11ec47830ea926c00d6ff1632a2|TrojanSpy.Win32.BROLER.A|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Filenames|Dates|\n|---|---|\n|20190625米中貿易摩擦と金融・資本市場への影響（{masked}.pdf (EN: 20190625 US-China trade disputes and its effect on Financial and capital markets ({masked}) .pdf)|2019/07/05|\n|2019{masked}関連影響レポート_日系企業各社の対応_{masked}.pdf (EN: 2019{masked}-related impact report_Response of Japanese Companies.pdf)|2019/06/26|\n|{masked}中国産業データ＆リポート-習主席G20欠席なら追加関税導入-20190612.pdf (EN: {masked}Chinese industrial data & report - more tariffs if Xi doesn’t show at G20 - 20190612.pdf)|2019/06/15|\n|20190523_{masked}関連影響レポート_1900時点_{masked}.pdf (EN: 20190523_{masked}-related impact report_1900_{masked}.pdf)|2019/05/31|\n|【顧客配布可】米中摩擦～新たな世界秩序と企業戦略～（日本語）.pdf (EN: [For Customers]US-China trade disputes~New world order and corporate strategy~ (Japanese) .pdf)|2019/05/22|\n|中国における日系企業の求人動向レポート2019年3月分.pdf (EN: Job market report of Japanese companies in China - March 2019.pdf)|2019/04/22|\n|新元号豆知識-元号-{masked}20190408.pptx (EN: New era name tips - era name-{masked}20190408.pptx)|2019/04/08|\n|{masked}-中国経済週報（2019.3.21～3.29）.pdf (EN: {masked}-Chinese economy weekly report (2019.3.21～3.29) .pdf)|2019/04/01|\n|(詳細版)2019年昇給率参考資料.pdf (EN: (Details)Reference material for Salary increase rate 2019.pdf)|2019/03/22|\n|2019中国商务环境调查报告.pdf (EN: 2019 China Business Environment Survey Report.pdf)|2019/03/12|\n|2019中国昇給率見通し各所発表.pdf (EN: 2019 Chinese salary increase rate outlook announcements 2019.pdf)|2019/02/20|\n|2018年12月早会內容.pdf (EN: December 2018 - Morning meeting content.pdf)|2019/02/17|\n|2019 {masked}CN Group Calendar - C.DOCX|2019/01/16|\n|2018年12月米中貿易摩擦調査.pdf (December 2018 - Survey on US-China trade disputes.pdf)|2019/01/16|\n\n\nTable 1.

Code pages inside the down_new downloader\n\n##### File size expansion to avoid antivirus scans\n\nTICK’s Operation ENDTRADE expanded the ABK downloader’s file size past 50MB, likely to avoid sandbox\n\nand antivirus (AV) products’ file size thresholds.\n\nFigure 11.

The Datper variant we analyzed creates two mutex objects called d0ftyzxcdrfdqwe\n\nand *&Hjgfc49gna-2-tjb, both functioning to retrieve information from the victim machine, implying the\n\nease by which the group can change the mutex pattern to suit their goals. The latest variant also uses a\n\nnew set of parameters — from ||| to [|-] — to evade AV pattern detection.\n\nFigure 13. Datper’s new mutex using an old set of separate parameters.\n\nFigure 14. Datper’s new mutex with new separate parameters\n\n\n-----\n\n##### ABK\n\nABK detects specific AV processes and sends the information back to TICK. It appends the parameters\n\n_uid and pid into the computer’s uniform resource identifier (URI) to identify the victim system’s host and_\n\ncheck the installed AV product.\n\nFigure 15. Code that scans for AV products running on the system\n\nFigure 16. Code that sends collected computer information back to TICK\n\nABK also uses steganography to hide additional payload in photos, which will be downloaded from\n\ncommand and control (C&C) server. This is a common technique that TICK has used in the past, with\n\nthe malicious image placed on legitimate websites to bypass security products. ABK extracts another\n\nportable executable (PE) file from the photo and executes it with cmd.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17. Downloading a malicious image from a legitimate website\n\nFigure 18.

Like ABK, BBK is also capable of using steganography,\n\nand uses cmd.exe to execute the PE file. However, BBK does not execute commands; we suspect that\n\nthis downloader is still in development.\n\n|73ab778cd1315b924435f9dbc57306fb13175429e6505673531f5cbda60d1889|Trojan.Win32.BROLER.G|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20. Code showing how the downloader retrieves a file from the C&C\n\nand renames it to xxxen.dat to pass the file as a batch script\n\nFigure 21. BBK Code for downloading a file from C&C\n\nNonetheless, the downloaded file from the C&C can easily be changed from one file type to another —\n\nsuch as a backdoor or another command — depending on what the attacker needs. Further, by adding\n\nor using the CreatePipe application program interface (API), BBK can add a sub-process for execution\n\nvia cmd.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22. Using CreatePipe API and executing cmd.exe\n\n_Sample Indicator of Compromise_\n\n0fba10247ea152662c3f98b3926083512708c167695435381cbefd378a074593 Trojan.Win32.BROLER.A\n\n##### build_downer\n\nAs seen in the timeline, both ABK and BBK may have been used to study the features of the downloader\n\ncomponents in the beginning of 2019, but TICK subsequently changed their preferred attack tool to\n\nbuild_downer midway through the year. While having a number of similarities in terms of code, build_\n\ndowner is a more stable, feature-filled tool compared to ABK and BBK. For example, this trojan can get\n\nvolume information and send it back to the C&C. If the response is anything except “404 not found,” it\n\nwill download a steganography JPEG file and extract a malware. After which, the trojan will use the same\n\nfunction to detect if the infected machine is running an antivirus process, and will use WINEXEC API to\n\nexecute the extracted malware.\n\nThe first feature creates a copy of itself into the %AppData% folder.\n\n|0fba10247ea152662c3f98b3926083512708c167695435381cbefd378a074593|Trojan.Win32.BROLER.A|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 23. Code that creates a copy in the %AppData% folder\n\nThe second feature checks the local time and make sure that the malware will only install itself during the\n\nhours that the infected system is active.\n\nFigure 24. Code that sets the downloader to execute only during work hours\n\nThe third feature adds itself to the RUN registry key disguised as “NVIDIA.”\n\nFigure 25. Code that adds build_downer to the registry as “NVIDIA”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe fourth feature layers the steganography algorithm. This is an improved method compared to the\n\nprevious routine that involves embedding the executable file in the photo.\n\nFigure 26.

Based on its malware structure and timeline, it appears TICK\n\nis trying to improve and develop their malware’s obfuscation techniques. Tomato is also capable of\n\nscanning for antivirus processes and functions, but it also adds a routine that prevents its entry from being\n\nregistered to the Add or Remove Programs window by renaming DisplayName to QuietDisplayName.\n\nTomato is notable for its ability to collect victim information from the command set; we found that it is the\n\nonly trojan in the entire operation that is capable of doing this.\n\nFigure 28. Trojan Tomato uses the QuietDisplayName registry parameter\n\nto hide the trojan from the Add or Remove Programs window\n\nFigure 29.

As with all the trojans analyzed, Snack also has AES encryption function. This batch of\n\ntrojan variants has the same encryption function, with an AES key that can generate module and default\n\nkeys, and similar initialization vector (IV) values.\n\n|be033e6b66928bfe280f6db0b91690b68f1eae7a3b3993807207ba86d5748a3d|Trojan.Win32.BROLER.G|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 30.

Otherwise, it uses =A1f as URI value and sends AES encrypted data\n\nback to the C&C.\n\nFigure 37. down_new’s AES key\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/python\n# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*#Copyright (C) 2019 Joey Chen\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import, division, unicode_literals\nfrom Crypto.Cipher import AES\nimport base64\ndef aes_decrypt(data, key, _IV):\n  cryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, _IV)\n  return cryptor.decrypt(data)\nif __name__ == ‘__main__’:\n  encrypt_data = «<ciphertext input>»\n  cyphertext = encrypt_data[:3]+encrypt_data[51:560]\n  #print cyphertext\n  cyphertext_ = base64.decodestring(cyphertext)\n  IV = encrypt_data[3:8]+encrypt_data[32:51]\n  #print IV\n  IV_ = base64.decodestring(IV)[0:16]\n  Key = encrypt_data[8:32]\n  #print Key\n  Key_ = base64.decodestring(Key)[0:16]\n  plain_text = aes_decrypt(cyphertext_, Key_, IV_)\n  print plain_text\n\n```\n\nFigure 38. Python script for AES decryption of down_new’s callback body\n\n##### Avenger\n\nDownloader Avenger has a number of variants as TICK appears to have developed different versions\n\ndepending on the targets. For instance, some variants use the autorun function while the others go\n\ninto in sleep mode for 300,000 milliseconds after system infection. Further analysis revealed that this\n\ndownloader’s routine had three stages:\n\n1. First stage: Collects from the host volume information, antivirus product, and OS bits version. It\n\nsends all the data back to the C&C server to verify if the host exists via the phone home beacon. This\n\nensures that it will only compromise the intended target.\n\n2. Second stage: If it exists in the C&C server, Avenger collects the victim’s information from the system\n\nby browsing through the folders such as the tasklist, files under Program Files and desktop, and\n\ndomain information.\n\n3. Third stage: If it doesn’t exist in the C&C server, Avenger will download an image embedded with\n\nmalware (via steganography) and extract a backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first stage will set CPUID and volume information as a value of the URI parameter id= and get the\n\nantivirus product type. The AV product type is set as a number, which indicates the installed antivirus\n\nproduct as a value of the URI parameter _group=. This function is the same as ABK, and will lead to_\n\nthe final parameter indicating the OS version. If the infected computer is running on a 32-bit operating\n\nsystem, the number will be 3. Otherwise, the number will be 6.\n\nFigure 39. Avenger’s first stage collects information\n\nIf the sent information exists and matches the list in the C&C, Avenger will collect the victim’s host\n\ninformation, write it into result.txt, and encrypt it with XOR into log.dat. The encrypted file will then be sent\n\nback to the C&C server.\n\nFigure 40. Avenger’s second stage writes the collected information to a .txt file\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 41. Avenger’s third stage sends the encrypted file to the C&C\n\nIf the information is not in the C&C list, Avenger will download the steganography photo and extract the\n\nbackdoor. The steganography algorithm shows that TICK further developed the code to make it even\n\nmore sophisticated than the algorithm used by build_downer.\n\nFigure 42. A backdoor found in a steganography image\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 43. Upgraded steganography technique\n\nOnline scanning revealed a newer version of the Avenger downloader with a clearer code structure and\n\ninternal IP testing URL, as well as a newer version of PDB strings showing _Avenger2. The rest of its_\n\ncomponents had very minimal differences with the previous version.\n\n_C:\\Users\\Frank\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2010\\Projects\\Avenger2\\Release\\Avenger2.pdb_\n\nFigure 44.

This\n\nimplies that if the client first connects to the team server, Cobalt Strike will ask if the user recognizes the\n\nSHA1 hash of this team server’s SSL certificate.\n\n|51a41a16d18c801aea558e051d6c7db8d7f820754d455b1061a9213e05cb1c14|TROJ_AVGR.ZAGG|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 45. Casper connecting to the C&C\n\nFigure 46. Casper C&C with Cobalt Strike’s server fingerprint\n\nThe backdoor is usually hidden in the steganography photo and can use several techniques and tools to\n\nbypass AV detection, much like the modified tools we found later on. One technique involves launching\n\nitself with a legitimate Windows application via DLL side-loading. Other methods involve injecting the\n\nbackdoor’s shellcode into svchost.exe, or placing the executable files inside the resources section.\n\nFigure 47.

In addition, they look into these online tools to modify\n\nthem or to import the techniques into their malware. As an example, they cloned Lilith RAT from GitHub.\n\nOriginally developed in C++.\n\nThe following is a collection of PDB strings related to open source RATs and tools:\n\n- C:\\Users\\XF\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2010\\Projects\\win10\\Release\\win10.pdb\n\n- C:\\Users\\jack\\Desktop\\RAT\\C+\\Lilith-master\\x64\\Release\\Lilith.pdb\n\n- C:\\Users\\jack\\Desktop\\RAT\\C+\\Lilith-master\\Release\\winlive.pdb\n\n- c:\\users\\frank\\desktop\\doubleagent-master\\bin\\doubleagent_x64.pdb\n\n- c:\\users\\frank\\desktop\\zwcreatethreadex_test.7z\\zwcreatethreadex_test\\x64\\debug\\\n\nzwcreatethreadex_test.pdb (see Figure 42)\n\nFigure 49.

A modified screen capture tool\n\nIn addition, we found some more details that caught our attention:\n\n- TICK prefers to use the folder C:\\Intel\\ for their storage in the infected machines\n\n- Some of their tools are customized, using tools downloaded from GitHub or blogs that they\n\nrebuilt or compiled\n\nFigure 52.

A look at the PDB strings revealed three notable\n\ndetails:\n\n1. PDB names tend to simply indicate their functions. TICK treats each malware as a project, with PDB\n\nnames that reveal what the malware does. For instance, HideFloder means the malware will try to\n\ncreate a fake folder, and test_mac means the malware will try to identify if it’s running on a virtual\n\nmachine.\n\n2. TICK actors utilized several open source projects online.\n\n3. Username Jack’s PDB strings showed that he had a test folder, which could mean that the samples\n\nwere still in a development or testing phase.\n\nFigure 58.

Downloader Avenger debug information\n\nSome C&C servers showed the HTTP request header, which can imply that TICK was testing if the C&C\n\ncan correctly catch the information from the malware.\n\nFigure 60. C&C site testing and stable version\n\n\n-----\n\n## Potential Targets and TICK’s  Desired Information\n\nTICK appears to be targeting Japanese organizations, specifically those with subsidiaries in China, to\n\nserve as footholds for intrusion. Occasionally, overseas head offices’ security systems and protection\n\ncontrols may become weaker or have insufficient control on foreign subsidiaries. We have observed this\n\nto be true as we analyzed some infiltration attacks move successfully from Chinese offices to Japanese\n\nnetworks. For instance, we observed TICK placing a malicious executable file with a folder icon in the\n\nShared folder of an infected desktop from a Chinese subsidiary, which an employee in Japan executed.\n\nWe also found intrusions in the defense, chemical, aerospace, and satellite service industries.\n\nBefore May 2019, the group targeted a large number of companies across different industries, but one\n\nof the main targets was the defense sector. During an extended assistance for incident response in the\n\nregion, we found TICK trying to steal military-related documents from the victim’s network. However,\n\nby mid-May 2019, TICK appeared to have shifted their attention to the chemical industry. From these\n\nincidents, we believe that the goal of this entire operation is to steal proprietary and classified information\n\n– confidential military specifics, technology and advanced materials – which may be of interest to TICK’s\n\nparent organization.\n\nWe will continue to monitor this campaign and develop our protection system as they sustain attacks on\n\nthe said industries. We expect the group to shift their targeted sectors again.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTICK is a cyberespionage group that should not be considered dormant nor inactive, but a persistent\n\nentity with advanced skill levels and the financial capacity to support its activities. Besides setting\n\nthemselves apart from cybercriminal groups only concerned with yielding profits from any potential\n\nvictim, they ensure that their intended targets are of high-value, as evidenced by the extensive verification\n\nroutine they perform once a target has been compromised. In addition, they have developed new malware\n\nfamilies (such as Avenger and down_new) that are based on the malware families they previously used,\n\nwith specific PDB strings that stand out with every deployment of Operation ENDTRADE. By using them\n\nin consecutively executed attacks and being able to steal legitimate emails for spear phishing, targeting\n\nJapanese companies and their foreign subsidiaries in China may only be one the many operations they\n\nhave lined up. This may ring true considering a number of their attack routines and malware appear to still\n\nbe in development and testing phase.\n\nFurthermore, while TICK has developed a considerable number of malware families, we expect them\n\nto develop more malware for future attacks, with features to prevent identification from the analyzed\n\nroutines, as evidenced by some of their signatures in Operation ENDTRADE. First, their new malware’s\n\ncallback URI paths are comparably similar to their previously deployed malware. Second, they continue\n\nusing legitimate sites as their C&C server sites to download payloads from. Third, one of their preferred\n\ntechniques – steganography – is not only used in every attack in the past but showed a number of\n\nversions and enhancements for this specific operation. Studying their victims’ environments, we found a\n\nnumber of their characteristic tools mentioned by other cybersecurity companies in thwarting their attack\n\nattempts. Finally, one of their backdoors (DATPER) and trojans (BBK) used the same website as their C&C.\n\nThe diversity and scope of their malware families highlight the varying degrees of proficiency this group\n\ncan employ to remain undetected and exfiltrate data. This is evident in the group’s use of legitimate and\n\npublicly-available tools in order to make it more difficult for inexperienced IT teams, research teams, or\n\neven dedicated incident response teams to trace, analyze, and detect the attacks. Technical details from\n\nthe malware routines also heavily imply that these attacks may just be the tip of the iceberg: more attacks\n\ncan be expected, with improved versions compared to what we have seen. Industries and business\n\nsectors should make it a priority to invest and install advanced security measures, strengthen their security\n\npolicies and procedures, and improve their employees’ security knowledge and awareness.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe strongly advise that enterprises develop and implement monitoring systems and establish a clear chain\n\nof command. This operation not only highlights the importance of these two, but also observed that when\n\nattacks like these occur, affected organizations find it difficult to take control of their foreign subsidiaries’\n\nsecurity systems. In addition, companies with small overseas offices may not have sufficient resources\n\nto isolate and investigate the infected machines, making monitoring weak and incident response difficult.\n\nEnterprises and critical infrastructures will always be targeted by persistent attacks. Therefore, it is\n\nparamount that organizations become aware and knowledgeable on the latest threats that may be used\n\nagainst them and the necessary measures that can be established to defend against them. When sensitive\n\ninformation and assets are stolen, it not only affects the targeted group but all the business partners, and\n\nas this campaign showed, it can easily become an economic or safety concern.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Appendix\n\n###### MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n\n|Tactic|Technique|ID|Description|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Initial Access|Spearphishing Attachment|T1193|Used to deliver first
