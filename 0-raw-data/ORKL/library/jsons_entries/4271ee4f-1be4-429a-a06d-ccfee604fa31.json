The hack was a failed attempt to withdraw money via the Russian interbank transaction system known as AWS CBR (Automated Work Station Client of the Russian Central Bank).\n\n\"Hackers gained access to the system, but the attack wasn't successful due to improper preparation of the payment order. The\n\nbank's employees suspended the transaction,\" Group-IB explained in its report.\n\nHowever, the bank's remediation efforts weren't up to par, and Silence regained access to the same bank's network a month later, in August\n2016. This time, they took another approach.\n\n\"[Silence] downloaded software to secretly take screenshots and proceeded to investigate the operator's work via video stream. This time, the\nbank asked Group-IB to respond to the incident. The attack\n\nwas stopped. However, the full log of the incident was unrecoverable, because in an attempt to clean the network, the bank's IT team deleted\nthe majority of the attacker's traces,\" Group-IB said.\n\nBut the Silence group didn't stop after these initial clumsy hacking attempts. They did manage to hack into a bank and finally steal some\nmoney, more than a year later, in October 2017.\n\nAccording to Group-IB, the group stopped attempting to wire money using the AWS CBR system and switched to targeting the bank's ATM\ncontrol systems, making ATMs spew out cash (known as jackpotting) at desired hours.\n\nInvestigators say that Silence stole over $100,000 during their first successful cyber-heist. Other hacks following the same pattern were later\ndiscovered and traced back to the Silence group in the following months, such as the theft of over $550,000 in February 2018, and another\n$150,000 in April 2018.\n\n**See also:** **[FIN6 returns to attack retailer point of sale systems in US, Europe](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fin6-returns-to-attack-retailers-in-us-europe/)**\n\nThe group is nowhere as successful as other criminal groups known to target financial institutions, such as Cobalt, Buhtrap, or MoneyTraper,\nall linked to multi-million dollar heists.\n\nThe reason, according to Group-IB experts, is that Silence is only a two-man operation --hence, they don't have the same vast human\nresources to throw at their targets as other groups do.\n\nThis is the reason why it took them more than a year to develop the Atmosphere malware they used in the 2017 and later ATM moneydispensing attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nsilence attacks.png\n\n\nTimeline of Silence attacks and tools\n\nGroup-IB\nBut it was when Group-IB researchers analyzed the group's entire malware arsenal that they discovered that despite being a two-man group,\nSilence was actually pretty good at what it did.\n\nResearchers say the group was very efficient at crafting spear-phishing emails. These spear-phishing emails used exploits for the following\nWindows and Office vulnerabilities CVE-2017-0199, CVE-2017-11882+CVE-2018-0802, CVE-2017-0262, CVE-2017-0263, and CVE-20188174.\n\nThe exploits implanted the Silence modular malware framework on victim's systems. The group would use locally installed tools for\nreconnaissance and lateral movement, and would only deploy Atmosphere when they knew they infected the proper computer that ran ATMspecific software.\n\n\n-----\n\ne eeded, t e g oup ou d a so a ua y od y a a e de e oped by ot e c oo s, suc as t e ot ac bac doo, t e S o e\ndownloader, or the Undernet DDoS bot.\n\nGroup-IB says that these modifications to third-party malware are what led its researchers to reach the conclusion that at least one of the\nSilence group members used to, or still works, in the cyber-security industry.\n\n\nsilence-members.png\n\n\nGroup-IB\nGroup-IB codenamed the Silence group's members as The Developer and The Operator. They say the former developed or modified all the\ngroup's malware, while the latter was the one using them to infect banks and carry out the hacks.\n\nThe Developer, in particular, showed advanced knowledge of malware families and reverse engineering skills, but lacked the knowledge to\nwrite top-quality code from scratch --a typical trait of most security researchers, who spend most of their time reverse engineering other\npeople's code, rather than writing their own.\n\n\n-----\n\nt s ob ous t at t e c a s espo s b e o t ese c es e e at so e po t act e t e secu ty co u ty t e as pe et at o teste s\nor reverse engineers,\" said Dmitry Volkov, Chief Technology Officer and Head of Threat Intelligence at Group-IB.\n\n\"[The Developer] knows exactly how to develop software, but he does not know how to program properly.\"\n\n**See also:** **[This malware disguises itself as bank security to raid your account](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-malware-disguises-itself-as-bank-security-to-raid-your-account/)**\n\nAs for Silence's origin, Group-IB believes the two are based either in Russia or another Russian-speaking country.\n\n\"Group-IB experts concluded that Silence is a group of Russian-speaking hackers, based on their commands language, the location of\ninfrastructure they used, and the geography of their targets (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Poland, and Kazakhstan),\" the Russian\ncyber-security firm said today in a press release.\n\n\"Furthermore, Silence used Russian words typed on an English keyboard layout for the commands of the employed backdoor. The hackers\nalso used Russian-language web hosting services.\"\n\nGroup-IB did not share the names of the hacked banks but only said that \"successful attacks currently have been limited to the CIS and\nEastern European countries,\" although the group sent spear-phishing emails to banks all over the world.\n\n\n-----",
