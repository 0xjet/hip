This report will focus on one such malicious application used by the\nAPT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group APT37. APT37 is also known by the following names – Reaper,\nRicochet Chollima, ScarCruft group. This group performs its malicious activities through an application\nclaiming the Secure Talk application.\n\nAPT37 is a North Korean state-sponsored cyberespionage group that has been active since around 2012.\nThis group is known to target victims from countries in Asia such as South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Russia,\nNepal, China, and India. APT37 has also targeted Romania, Kuwait, and various parts of the Middle East.\n\n[Cyble Research Labs came across a securelist article where researchers are claiming that a fresh attack](https://securelist.com/scarcruft-surveilling-north-korean-defectors-and-human-rights-activists/105074/)\nwas carried out targeting North Korean defectors and human rights activists. The Threat Actor (TA) APT37\nused new spyware called “Chinotto” to carry out these attacks. Cyble Research Labs downloaded one of\nthe samples and performed a deep-dive analysis of the Chinotto Android spyware.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT37 has also been linked to malicious campaigns between 2016-2018. In 2016, they targeted North\nKorean defectors, human rights activists, and journalists covering news related to North Korea and\ngovernment organizations associated with the Korean Peninsula. They have been linked to high-profile\nattacks such as Operation Daybreak, Operation Erebus, Golden Time, Evil New Year, Are you Happy?,\nFreeMilk, North Korean Human Rights, and Evil New Year 2018.\n\nThe malware is designed for stealthy espionage, as once this application is successfully executed on user\ndevices. It can steal sensitive data like contacts data, SMS data, call logs, device information, and files\nfrom the device’s external storage.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### APK Metadata Information\n\nApp Name: SecureTalk\nPackage Name: com.private.talk\nSHA256 Hash: 8fb42bb9061ccbb30c664e41b1be5787be5901b4df2c0dc1839499309f2d9d93\n\nFigure 1 shows the metadata information of the application.\n\nFigure 1 – App Metadata Information\nThe application flow is shown in Figure 2. Upon being launched, the application asks for certain sensitive\npermissions, after which it displays the login page. During this time, the APK performs its malicious\nactivities behind the scenes.\n\nFigure 2 – App Start Flow\n\n### Manifest Description\n\nThe application requests thirteen different permissions. Of these thirteen permissions, the attackers could\nabuse eight to carry out the following activities:\n\nReading SMSs, Call Logs, and Contacts data.\nReading current cellular network information, phone number and the serial number of the victim’s\nphone, the status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any Phone Accounts registered on the device.\nReading or writing files on the device’s external storage.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have listed these dangerous permissions below.\n\n**Permissions** **Description**\n\nREAD_SMS Access phone’s messages\n\nREAD_CONTACTS Access phone’s contacts\n\nREAD_CALL_LOG Access phone’s call logs\n\nREAD_PHONE_STATE Allows access to phone state, including the current cellular network\ninformation, the phone number and the serial number of this phone,\nthe status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any Phone Accounts\nregistered on the device\n\nWRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE Allows the app to write or delete files to the external storage of the\ndevice\n\nREAD_EXTERNAL_STORAGE Allows the app to read the contents of the device’s external storage\n\nGET_ACCOUNTS Allows the app to get the list of accounts used by the phone\n\nREAD_PHONE_NUMBERS Allows the app to read the device’s phone number(s).\n\nTable 1: Permissions’ Description\nFigure 3 shows the launcher activity of the application.\n\nFigure 3 – App Launcher\n\nActivity\n\n### Source Code Description\n\nThe code snippets highlighted in Figure 4 show that the application steals the device’s contact data.\n\nFigure 4 – Code to Read Contact Data\nThe code snippets highlighted in Figure 5 show that the application steals the device’s SMS data.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5 – Code to Read SMS Data\nThe code snippets in Figure 6 show that the application steals the device’s call logs data.\n\nFigure 6 – Code to Read Call Logs\nThe code snippets shown in Figure 7 show that the application steals the victim device’s information, such\nas:\n\nReading the device’s phone number(s).\nReading Android Operating System version Information.\nReading device details such as brand name, model, serial number, etc.\nChecking for the presence of external storage on the device.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7 – Code to Read Device Information\nThe code snippets shown in Figure 8 show that the application steals the account details being used on\nthe device.\n\nFigure\n\n8 – Code to Read Accounts Information\nThe code snippets shown in Figure 9 show that the application also steals image and audio files from the\ndevice.\n\nFigure 9 – Code to Access Pictures and Audio\nThe code snippets in the figure below show that the application collects the data from the device and\nwrites it in a text file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10 – Code to Write Collected Data in Text File.png\nThe snippets below indicate the application’s code flow to upload the data on TA’s Command and Control\n(C&C) server.\n\nFigure 11 – Code to Upload the Data to TA’s C&C Server\nThe snippet below shows that the application performs activities with commands defined by the TA(s).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12 – Commands Defined by the TA(s)\nThe table below highlights some of the commands defined by the TA.\n\n**Permissions** **Description**\n\nref: Sends signal to C&C server\n\ndown Uploads /.temp-file.dat file\n\nUriP Writes path /.temp-file.dat to _/result-file.dat file and upload to C&C_\n\n“” Writes results to /result-file.dat and upload to C&C\n\nTable 2 – Commands Description\n\n### Traffic Analysis\n\nDuring traffic analysis of the application, we identified that it continuously communicates with the TA’s C&C\nserver\n\n_hxxp://haeundaejugong[.]com/data/jugong/do.php?_\n_type=command&direction=receive&id=1295c8887ec39859_hd._\n\nThe below figure shows that the application uploads sensitive data such as contacts, call logs, and SMSs\nfrom the device to TA’s C&C.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13 – Uploads Sensitive Data to the TA’s C&C\n\n## Threat Actor Infrastructure Analysis\n\nCyble Research Labs has also identified that the TA’s infrastructure was hosted in South Korea (KR)\n\nFigure 14 – Location of Domain Hosted\n\nWe also noticed the TTL value of the MX record of http[:]//haeundaejugong.com is 60, which is generally\nan indicator of Fast-Flux behavior.\n\nFigure 15 – TTL\n\nValue of MX record of TA’s Domain\n\n## Conclusion\n\nChinotto is spyware targeting specific users to steal sensitive information such as contacts, SMSs, call\nlogs and files. It also has the capability to record audio from the device without the victim’s knowledge.\n\nThreat Actors constantly adapt their methods to avoid detection and find new ways to target users through\nsophisticated techniques. Such malicious applications often masquerade as legitimate applications to\nconfuse users into installing them.\n\nUsers should install applications only after verifying their authenticity and install them exclusively from the\nofficial Google Play Store to avoid such attacks.\n\n## Our Recommendations\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against\nattackers.
