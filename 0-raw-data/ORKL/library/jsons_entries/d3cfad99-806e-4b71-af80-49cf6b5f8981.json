The campaign leverages Hakbit, a\nvariant of [Thanos ransomware as a service (RaaS). The attack employs malicious Microsoft Excel](https://www.recordedfuture.com/thanos-ransomware-builder/)\nattachments delivered from a free email provider (GMX) that primarily serves a European client\nbase. The attachments contain false billing and tax repayment subjects to entice users to enable\nmacros that [execute GuLoader, which downloads the ransomware to encrypt files and lock the](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/guloader-popular-new-vb6-downloader-abuses-cloud-services)\nsystem.\n\nTo help ensure success because Microsoft Office VBA macros do not execute on mobile devices,\nthese emails direct recipients to open attachments on their computer and not their mobile device.\n\nUsers targeted were employed in mid-level positions across the pharmaceutical, legal, financial,\nbusiness service, retail, and healthcare sector. The largest volume of messages we observed\nwere sent to the information technology, manufacturing, insurance, and technology verticals.\nProofpoint researchers have observed that the majority of roles targeted in the Hakbit campaigns\nare customer-facing with individuals’ business contact information revealed publicly on company\nwebsites, and/or advertisements. These roles include attorneys, client advisors, directors,\ninsurance advisors, managing directors, and project managers.\n\nBelow is an example of the lure, many messages arrived with subject lines such as “\"Fwd:\nSteuerrückzahlung\" (Translated: Tax Repayment)” and “Ihre Rechnung (Translated: Your Bill)”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 Hakbit Lure Email Message in German_\n\n[This lure is in German and abuses the logo and branding of 1&1, a German telecommunications](https://www.1und1.de/)\ncompany. According to Google Translate, the body of the message states:\n\n_Today you will receive your invoice dated 12.05.2020. You will find it in the attachment to_\n_this e-mail as an Excel file. We will debit the amount of EUR 480.19 from your account on_\n_May 17th, 2020._\n\n_Please note that due to technical reasons the Excel document is not displayed correctly on_\n_mobile devices. We ask you to download the invoice on your computer and open it._\n\n_Best regards,_\n\nThe message contains a Microsoft Excel attachment named 379710.xlsm which leverages\nmalicious macros. Because the macros and malware won’t work on a mobile device, the message\ninstructs the recipient to use a computer to read the attachment. Once opened, the spreadsheet\ndirects the recipient in German and English to enable macros as shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Microsoft Excel Attachment with Enable Macros Message_\n\nOnce macros are enabled in the spreadsheet, it downloads and executes GuLoader, a relatively\n[new downloader written in VB 6.0 that we wrote about in March 2020. When GuLoader runs, it](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/node/92101)\ndownloads and executes Hakbit, a ransomware that encrypts files using AES-256 encryption.\n\nBelow is the image that appears when Hakbit executes (Figure 3) and the ransom note in both\nEnglish and German (Figure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Hakbit Ransom Screen_\n\n_Figure 4 Hakbit Ransom Note_\n\nThe note demands a payment of 250 Euros in bitcoin to unlock the encrypted files and provides\ninstructions on how to pay the ransom. As of June 16, 2020, our researchers have found no\ntransactions showing payment of the ransom to the bitcoin wallet in the examples here.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nProofpoint researchers have observed consistent low-volume and often boutique ransomware\ncampaigns since January 2020. Proofpoint researchers recently identified a shift in the threat\nlandscape with a large-scale Avaddon ransomware campaign consistent with recent open source\nvendor reporting. Hakbit exemplifies a people-centric ransomware campaign tailored to a specific\naudience, role, organization, and in the user’s native language.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n**Hakbit** **SHA256** **34b93f1989b272866f023c34a2243978565fcfd23869cacc58ce592c1c545d8e**\n\n\n-----\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
