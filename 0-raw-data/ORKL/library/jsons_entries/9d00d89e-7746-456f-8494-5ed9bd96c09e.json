The malware was used by threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-2868, a\nformer zero-day vulnerability affecting versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).\n\nWHIRLPOOL is a backdoor that establishes a Transport Layer Security (TLS) reverse shell to the Command-and-Control (C2)\nserver.\n\nFor information about related malware, specifically information on the initial exploit payload and other backdoors, see CISA Alert:\nCISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda Backdoors.\n\n\n**Submitted Files (1)**\n\n\n0af253e60456b03af49cc675f71d47b2dd9a48f50a927e43b9d8116985c06459 (ssld)\n\n## Findings\n\n**0af253e60456b03af49cc675f71d47b2dd9a48f50a927e43b9d8116985c06459**\n\n\n**Tags**\n\n\ntrojan\n\n\n**Details**\n\n\n**Name** ssld\n\n**Size** 5034648 bytes\n\n**Type** ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked,\nBuildID[sha1]=9d3200c170c74a79f66e2c885e51519866e636eb, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped\n**MD5** 77e1e9bf69b09ed0840534adb8258540\n\n**SHA1** deadca9bd85ee5c4e086fd81eee09407b769e9b6\n\n**SHA256** 0af253e60456b03af49cc675f71d47b2dd9a48f50a927e43b9d8116985c06459\n\n**SHA512** 3ad6bd00c4195c9b1757a9d697196e8beffb343c331509c2eda24bbbd009cc1af552a1900ab04d169a22d273e6359cb\n2ff149050a7f792b9630108a4af226e2d\n**ssdeep** 98304:1z2EGoxipg0NPbuqbVxbNgqE+Q+F4YGZLx4BAFm/CyU:LLXYGNFLj\n\n**Entropy** 6.385269\n\n\n-----\n\n**Antivirus**\n\n\n**ESET** a variant of Linux/WhirlPool.A trojan\n\n\n**YARA Rules**\n\n\n\n- rule CISA_10452108_02 : WHIRLPOOL backdoor communicates_with_c2 installs_other_components\n\n{\nmeta:\nAuthor = \"CISA Code & Media Analysis\"\nIncident = \"10452108\"\nDate = \"2023-06-20\"\nLast_Modified = \"20230804_1730\"\nActor = \"n/a\"\nFamily = \"WHIRLPOOL\"\nCapabilities = \"communicates-with-c2 installs-other-components\"\nMalware_Type = \"backdoor\"\nTool_Type = \"unknown\"\nDescription = \"Detects malicious Linux WHIRLPOOL samples\"\nSHA256_1 = \"83ca636253fd1eb898b244855838e2281f257bbe8ead428b69528fc50b60ae9c\"\nSHA256_2 = \"8849a3273e0362c45b4928375d196714224ec22cb1d2df5d029bf57349860347\"\nstrings:\n$s0 = { 65 72 72 6f 72 20 2d 31 20 65 78 69 74 }\n$s1 = { 63 72 65 61 74 65 20 73 6f 63 6b 65 74 20 65 72 72 6f 72 3a 20 25 73 28 65 72 72 6f 72 3a 20 25 64 29 }\n$s2 = { c7 00 20 32 3e 26 66 c7 40 04 31 00 }\n$a3 = { 70 6c 61 69 6e 5f 63 6f 6e 6e 65 63 74 }\n$a4 = { 63 6f 6e 6e 65 63 74 20 65 72 72 6f 72 3a 20 25 73 28 65 72 72 6f 72 3a 20 25 64 29 }\n$a5 = { 73 73 6c 5f 63 6f 6e 6e 65 63 74 }\ncondition:\nuint32(0) == 0x464c457f and 4 of them\n}\n\n**ssdeep Matches**\n\nNo matches found.\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\nThe file 'ssld' is a Linux ELF reverse shell and is a variant of WHIRLPOOL malware used on the Barracuda Email Security Gateway\n(ESG) device (Figure 1). The file looks for an encoded string with a '.io' extension (Figure 2). The string will be decoded and the\ndata will be passed as the C2 which will include the Internet Protocol (IP) address and port number used to establish a reverse\nshell.\n\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1. - The reverse shell component of 'ssld'.**\n\n**Figure 2. - The file 'ssld' looking for a string with a '.io' extension.**\n\n## Recommendations\n\nCISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of\ntheir organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to\nimplementation to avoid unwanted impacts.\n\n - Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.\n\n - Keep operating system patches up-to-date.\n\n - Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.\n\n - Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators\n\ngroup unless required.\n\n - Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.\n\n - Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.\n\n - Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.\n\n - Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\n\n - Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension\n\nmatches the file header).\n\n - Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.\n\n\n-----\n\n - Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).\n\n - Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.\n\n - Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).\n\nAdditional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST) Special Publication 800-83, \"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops\".\n\n## Contact Information\n\n - 1-888-282-0870\n\n[• CISA Service Desk (UNCLASS)](mailto:CISAservicedesk@cisa.dhs.gov)\n\n[• CISA SIPR (SIPRNET)](mailto:NCCIC@dhs.sgov.gov)\n\n[• CISA IC (JWICS)](mailto:NCCIC@dhs.ic.gov)\n\nCISA continuously strives to improve its products and services.

A Malware Initial Findings Report (MIFR) is intended to provide organizations with malware analysis in a timely**\nmanner. In most instances this report will provide initial indicators for computer and network defense. To request additional analysis,\nplease contact CISA and provide information regarding the level of desired analysis.\n\n**What is a MAR? A Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is intended to provide organizations with more detailed malware analysis**\nacquired via manual reverse engineering. To request additional analysis, please contact CISA and provide information regarding\nthe level of desired analysis.\n\n**Can I edit this document?
