Attackers would use\nthis router to control and retrieve data from infected victims, putting an additional layer of\nanonymity between them, victims, and forensic investigators.\n\nThis is not the first time that nation-state hackers have used routers as part of their attack\n[infrastructure, this being a very popular trend recently (let's not forget](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyber-espionage-groups-are-increasingly-leveraging-routers-in-their-attacks/) [VPNFilter), but it is](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nation-state-group-hacked-500-000-routers-to-prepare-a-cyber-attack-on-ukraine/)\nthe first time they hosted a C&C server on one.\n\n\"The most unusual and interesting point here is the target. A national data center is a\nvaluable source of data that can also be abused to compromise official websites,\"\nKaspersky expert Denis Legezo explained. \"Another interesting point is the Mikrotik router,\nwhich we believe was hacked specifically for the campaign.\"\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[Chinese ‘Space Pirates’ are hacking Russian aerospace firms](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-space-pirates-are-hacking-russian-aerospace-firms/)\n\n[Google: Chinese state hackers keep targeting Russian govt agencies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-chinese-state-hackers-keep-targeting-russian-govt-agencies/)\n\n[Cyberspies use IP cameras to deploy backdoors, steal Exchange emails](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyberspies-use-ip-cameras-to-deploy-backdoors-steal-exchange-emails/)\n\n[Trend Micro fixes bug Chinese hackers exploited for espionage](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trend-micro-fixes-bug-chinese-hackers-exploited-for-espionage/)\n\n[APT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/apt/)\n[China](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/china/)\n[Cyber-espionage](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Data Center](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-center/)\n[Drive-By Download](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/drive-by-download/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a\nfew more.
