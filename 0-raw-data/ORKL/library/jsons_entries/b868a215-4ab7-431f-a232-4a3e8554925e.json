    "plain_text": "# Report: Travelex paid hackers $2.3 million worth of Bitcoin after ransomware attack\n\n**grahamcluley.com/travelex-paid-ransom/**\n\nApril 9, 2020\n\nRemember how back in January I raised one of the central mysteries behind Travelex’s\nransomware attack – namely, had the foreign currency exchange service paid its attackers a\nransom or not?\n\nTravelex was notably refusing to answer any questions about whether it had given in to the\nextortionists’ demands.\n\nBut now, the Wall Street Journal [reports, it sounds like Travelex paid US $2.3 million worth of](https://www.wsj.com./articles/travelex-paid-hackers-multimillion-dollar-ransom-before-hitting-new-obstacles-11586440800)\nBitcoin to the REvil ransomware gang, who had threatened to publish personal data of\ncustomers stolen from Travelex’s network.\n\nOwned by London-listed payments conglomerate Finablr PLC, Travelex found its\noperations crippled by a New Year’s Eve ransomware attack that left some of its\nsystems offline for weeks. The finance company paid out the ransom in the form of 285\nbitcoin, according to the person with knowledge of the transaction.\n\nAsked about the payment, a Travelex spokesman said the firm has taken advice from a\nnumber of experts and has kept regulators and partners informed about its efforts to\nmanage the recovery. A U.K. law-enforcement investigation into the breach is\ncontinuing, he said. He declined to comment further on the incident.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhether ransoms should be paid or not is a divisive topic, and I find it hard to give a simple\nanswer. I can well understand the position of those who say that it encourages more\nransomware attacks against other organisations if a ransom is paid. It certainly does.\n\nBut at the same time, when a company is on the ropes, it has no other options, and its\nsurvival is in question, it’s hard not to sympathise with a difficult decision being made to pay\nthose who were behind the attack if it helps ensure the firm stays afloat, and jobs are saved.\n\n**Sign up to our newsletter**\n\nSecurity news, advice, and tips.\n[Travelex’s management team had been strongly criticised for its shambolic response to the](https://grahamcluley.com/travelex-want-you-to-know-that-everythings-going-really-really-well/)\nattack, which saw the firm [delay confirming it had been hit by ransomware for over a week.](https://grahamcluley.com/travelex-ransomware/)\n\n[Eventually Travelex began to hobble back online at the end of January.](https://grahamcluley.com/travelex-ransomware-website/)\n\nThe financial problems faced by Travelex and its parent company, Finablr, have only\nincreased in the months since due to the enormous impact the Coronavirus pandemic has\nhad on its business.\n\n_[Found this article interesting?
