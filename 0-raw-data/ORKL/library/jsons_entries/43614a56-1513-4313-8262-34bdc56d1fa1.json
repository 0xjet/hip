[Singapore.[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore) Its products are in use in dozens of countries\nacross six continents.[8]\n\n\n## Company foundation\n\nHackingTeam was founded in 2003 by Italian entrepreneurs Vincenzetti and Valeriano\nBedeschi. In 2007 the company was invested by two Italian VC: Fondo Next and Innogest.\n\n\n\n[9]\n\n\nThe Milan police department learned of the company. Hoping to use its tool to spy on Italian\ncitizens and listen to their Skype calls, the police contacted Vincenzetti and asked him to help.\n\n[10] HackingTeam became \"the first sellers of commercial hacking software to the police”.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to former employee Byamukama Robinhood, the company began as security\nservices provider, offering [penetration testing, auditing and other defensive capabilities to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_testing)\nclients.[11] Byamukama states that as malware and other offensive capabilities were developed\nand accounted for a larger percentage of revenues, the organization pivoted in a more\noffensive direction and became increasingly compartmentalized. Byamukama claims fellow\nemployees working on aspects of the same platform – for example, Android exploits and\npayloads – would not communicate with one another, possibly leading to tensions and strife\nwithin the organization.[11]\n\nIn February 2014, a report from [Citizen Lab identified the organisation to be using hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Lab)\nservices from [Linode,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linode) [Telecom Italia,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecom_Italia) [Rackspace, NOC4Hosts and bullet proof hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rackspace)\ncompany [Santrex.[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Santrex&action=edit&redlink=1)\n\nOn 5 July 2015 the company suffered a major data breach of customer data, software code,\ninternal documents and e-mails. (See: _§ 2015 data breach)_\n\n\nOn 2 April 2019 HackingTeam was acquired by InTheCyber Group to create Memento Labs [13]\n\n## Products and capabilities\n\n\nHacking Team enables clients to perform remote monitoring functions against citizens via their\n[RCS (remote control systems), including their Da Vinci and Galileo platforms:[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_administration_tool)\n\nCovert collection of emails, text message, phone call history and address books\n[Keystroke logging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging)\nUncover search history data and take screenshots\nRecord audio from phone calls\n\n[Capture audio and video stream from device memory to bypass cryptography of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) [Skype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype)\nsessions[14]\nUse microphones on device to collect ambient background noise and conversations\n\n\nActivate phone or computer cameras\nHijack telephone GPS systems to monitor target's location\nInfect target computer's [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI) [BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS) [firmware with a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware) [rootkit[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit)\nExtract WiFi passwords[16]\nExfiltrate [Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency wallet files to collect data on local accounts,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)\ncontacts and transaction histories[17]\n\nHackingTeam uses advanced techniques to avoid draining cell phone batteries, which could\npotentially raise suspicions, and other methods to avoid detection.[18][19]\n\n\n[The malware has payloads for Android,[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) [BlackBerry, Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry) [iOS,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) [Linux,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) [Mac OS X,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X) [Symbian,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian)\nas well as [Microsoft Windows,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) [Windows Mobile and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Mobile) [Windows Phone class of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone) operating\nsystems.[20]\n\n\n-----\n\nRCS is a management platform that allows operators to remotely deploy exploits and payloads\nagainst targeted systems, remotely manage devices once compromised, and exfiltrate data for\nremote analysis.\n\n## Controversies\n\n### Use by repressive governments\n\nHackingTeam has been criticized for selling its products and services to governments with poor\n[human rights records, including Sudan,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan) [Bahrain,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain) [Venezuela, and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela) [Saudi Arabia.[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia)\n\n\nIn June 2014, a [United Nations panel monitoring the implementation of sanctions on Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations)\nrequested information from HackingTeam about their alleged sales of software to the country in\ncontravention of United Nations weapons export bans to Sudan. Documents leaked in the 2015\ndata breach of HackingTeam revealed the organization sold Sudanese National Intelligence\nand Security Service access to their \"Remote Control System\" software in 2012 for 960,000\nEuros.[21]\n\nIn response to the United Nations panel, the company responded in January 2015 that they\nwere not currently selling to Sudan. In a follow-up exchange, HackingTeam asserted that their\nproduct was not controlled as a weapon, and so the request was beyond the scope of the\npanel. There was no need for them to disclose previous sales, which they considered\nconfidential business information.[21]\n\n\nThe U.N. disagreed. \"The view of the panel is that as such software is ideally suited to support\nmilitary electronic intelligence (ELINT) operations it may potentially fall under the category of\n'military ... equipment' or 'assistance' related to prohibited items,\" the secretary wrote in March.\n\"Thus its potential use in targeting any of the belligerents in the Darfur conflict is of interest to\nthe Panel.\"[21][22]\n\nIn the fall of 2014, the Italian government abruptly froze all of HackingTeam's exports, citing\nhuman rights concerns. After lobbying Italian officials, the company temporarily won back the\nright to sell its products abroad.[21]\n\n### 2015 data breach\n\n\nOn July 5, 2015, the [Twitter account of the company was compromised by an unknown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter)\n[individual who published an announcement of a data breach against HackingTeam's computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach)\n[systems. The initial message read, \"Since we have nothing to hide, we're publishing all our e-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument)\n_[mails, files, and source code ...\" and provided links to over 400 gigabytes of data, including](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte)_\n[alleged internal e-mails, invoices, and source code; which were leaked via BitTorrent and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code)\n[Mega.[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_(service)) An announcement of the data breach, including a link to the bittorrent seed, was\nretweeted by [WikiLeaks and by many others through social media.[24][25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe material was voluminous and early analysis appeared to reveal that HackingTeam had\n[invoiced the Lebanese Army[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Army) and [Sudan and that spy tools were also sold to Bahrain and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan)\n[Kazakhstan.[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan) HackingTeam had previously claimed they had never done business with\nSudan.[27]\n\n[The leaked data revealed a zero-day cross-platform Flash exploit (CVE number:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)) [CVE-2015-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVE_(identifier))\n5119.[28] [The dump included a demo of this exploit by opening Calculator from a test webpage.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator_(computer_program))\n\n[29][30][31] [Adobe patched the hole on July 8, 2015.[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patch) Another vulnerability involving Adobe was\n\n[revealed in the dumps, which took advantage of a buffer overflow attack on an Adobe Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow)\n[Type Manager DLL included with Microsoft Windows.
