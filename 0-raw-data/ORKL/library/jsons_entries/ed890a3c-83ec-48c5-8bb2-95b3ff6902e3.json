With online classes increasingly becoming the\nnorm, the group’s phishing campaigns that aim to steal research data and intellectual\nproperty could have a high success rate.\n\nDozens of phishing domain names have been reported, although some may have already\nbeen taken down. Still, the Silent Librarian APT group could have more weaponized domains\nin their arsenal, so we tried to uncover some connections throughout this investigative\nanalysis using domain and IP intelligence.\n\n**The IoCs: Commonalities and Characteristics**\n\n[Malwarebytes has identified 25 phishing subdomains and three IP addresses that targeted](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/malwarebytes-news/2020/10/silent-librarian-apt-phishing-attack/)\n21 universities and colleges worldwide.\n\nIP Geolocation\n\nUsing IP geolocation, we identified that two malicious IP addresses were assigned to Iran,\nand another one to India\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Use of Subdomains\n\nThe phishing subdomains used the same strings found in the universities’ legitimate domains\nbut at the third-level domain under a different root domain. The phishing domain\nlibrary[.]adelaide[.]crev[.]me, for example, looks much like the University of Adelaide Library’s\nlegitimate domain library[.]adelaide[.]edu[.]au.\n\nInstances when the threat actors used the full legitimate domain, such as\nidpz[.]utorauth[.]utoronto[.]ca[.]itlf[.]cf, which targets the University of Toronto (legitimate\ndomain: idpz[.]utorauth[.]utoronto[.]ca), were also found.\n\nTLD and Registrar Distribution of Root Domains\n\nOut of the 25 phishing subdomains, 14 root domains were identified. Ten of them are in the\n.me generic top-level domain (gTLD) space, two used .tk, while another two used .cf.\n\nTLD Distribution of Phishing Root Domains (%)\nWHOIS data showed that as of 5 November 2020, the two .cf domains (itlf[.]cf and sftt[.]cf)\nhave already been dropped. All of the other domains remain active and have the following\ndetails:\n\nTheir registrar is NameCheap, Inc.\nThe .me domains use WhoisGuard, Inc. protection, while the .tk domains use Freedom\nRegistry, Inc.\nThe registrant countries reflect that of the domains’ privacy protection services—\nPanama for WhoisGuard and the U.S. for Freedom Registry.\n\n\n-----\n\nAll of the domains were recently registered with dates within 14 August and 2 October.\n\n**Uncovering More Digital Footprints**\n\nNoting the number of times the root domains were used as Silent Library indicators of\n[compromise (IoCs), we discovered many possibly suspicious subdomains. The numbers are](https://subdomains.whoisxmlapi.com/api/?mc=circleid)\nreflected in the table below.\n\n\n**Root**\n**Domain**\n\n\n**Number of Times Used as a**\n**Silent Library IoC**\n\n\n**Number of Subdomains Found through**\n**Subdomains Lookup**\n\n\nitlf[.]cf 2 17\n\nitlt[.]tk 1 13\n\nitlib[.]me 5 8\n\niftl[.]tk 5 8\n\naroe[.]me 1 4\n\ncrir[.]me 1 4\n\ncanm[.]me 1 3\n\ncrev[.]me 2 3\n\nrres[.]me 1 3\n\ncvrr[.]me 1 2\n\nernn[.]me 1 2\n\nnrni[.]me 1 2\n\nsftt[.]cf 2 2\n\nninu[.]me 1 1\n\nWe focused on investigating the second to fourth root domains in the list above:\n\nitlt[.]tk\nitlib[.]me\niftl[.]tk\n\nThese domains had way more subdomains that were not used as IoCs. The first on the list,\nitlf[.]cf, is no longer active.\n\n\n-----\n\nLooking up subdomain and DNS data, we found 11 more subdomains that could be used to\ntarget universities, along with two IP addresses. The chart below shows the subdomains of\nthe three root domains. The subdomains in red have already been reported as Silent Library\nIoCs, while the rest could still figure in future attacks.\n\nChart 1: Root domain “iftl[.]tk”\n\nChart 2: Root domain “itlib[.]me”\n\n\n-----\n\nChart 3: Root domain “itit[.]tk”\nThe table below lists the potential subdomains that may be used to target the corresponding\nacademic institutions in the future. Some may currently be undetected.\n\n**Possible Phishing Subdomains** **Target**\n\nlibrary[.]libproxy[.]kcl[.]ac[.]uk[.]itlt[.]tk King’s College London\n\nwww[.]login[.]libproxy[.]kcl[.]ac[.]uk[.]itlt[.]tk King’s College London\n\nwww[.]library[.]libproxy[.]kcl[.]ac[.]uk[.]itlt[.]tk King’s College London\n\nwww[.]login.ki[.]se[.]itlt[.]tk Karolinska Institutet\n\nlogin[.]ki[.]se[.]itlt[.]tk Karolinska Institutet\n\nwww[.]login[.]ki[.]se[.]iftl[.]tk Karolinska Institutet\n\nwww.sso[.]id[.]kent[.]ac[.]uk[.]iftl[.]tk University of Kent\n\nwww[.]shibboleth[.]mcgill[.]ca[.]iftl[.]tk McGill University\n\nwww[.]shib[.]york[.]ac[.]uk[.]iftl[.]tk University of York\n\nauth[.]wright[.]edu[.]itlib[.]me Wright State University\n\nsso[.]acu[.]edu[.]au[.]itlib[.]me Australian Catholic University\n\n\n-----\n\n[Some of the Silent Library APT members have already been indicted in 2018, yet what](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-iranians-charged-conducting-massive-cyber-theft-campaign-behalf-islamic-revolutionary)\nremains of the group seem to continue targeting different universities across several\ncontinents.
