This can then be used to facilitate further compromises or additional malware\ninfections, which depends on how adversaries wish to monetize their access.\n\nYesterday (November 8, 2021), we spotted a malicious excel file trying to execute three\ndifferent files using regsvr32.exe:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 Malicious Excel File_\n\nAt first glance, this excel file contains one sheet which guides the user to enable the macro,\nultimately leading to a network connection and eventual delivery of QakBot.\nUncharacteristically, this sheet does not contain the usual culprits of a malicious file i.e. Excel\nMacro 4, sheet password protection, etc. This makes us suspicious. We enabled a\nDeveloper Tab in excel and checked this file’s VBA project.\n\n[To learn more about our malware solution, request a demo](https://www.minerva-labs.com/request-a-demo)\n\nWe found three more sheets that were hidden, and switched them to visible mode. All three\nsheets contained Excel Macro 4; one of the sheets contained letters, numbers, and symbols,\nand two others seemed to be responsible for creating a new folder using\nkerner32.dll!CreateDirectoryA, downloading three files from three different domains, saving\nthose files on a local disk in a create folder, and executing each one of them using\nregsvr32.exe:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe folder created was named “Datop” under a C:\\.\nThe downloaded files were named C:\\Datop\\good.good, C:\\Datop\\good1.good and\nC:\\Datop\\good2.good.\n\n[All three downloaded files were found to be Qakbot banking trojans’ DLLs. Qakbot, also](https://blog.minerva-labs.com/qbot-spam?hsLang=en-us)\nknown as Pinkslipbot, Qbot, and Quakbot. This is a notorious Banking Trojan designed to\nsteal account credentials and online banking session information, leading to account\ntakeover fraud.\n\n[This Squirrelwaffle sample employs the same delivery scheme as the one that was posted by](https://twitter.com/malware_traffic/status/1456293264974401550)\nMalware Traffic earlier this month.\n\n_Figure 2 Squirrelwaffle delivery scheme by Malware Traffic_\n\nMinerva Lab’s [Malicious Document Protection module prevents the execution of](https://minerva-labs.com/malicious-document-prevention)\nSquirrelwaffle-like malware, safeguarding the organization from a mass infection:\n\n\n-----\n\n## IOC’s\n\nDomains:\n\nhttps://dongarza[.]com/gJW5ma382Z/x.html\nhttps://headlinepost[.]net/3AkrPbRj/x.html\n[https://produtoratimedeelenco[.]com.br/9E6Y322u/x.html](http://10.10.0.46/about:blank)\n\nHashes:\n\ngood.good - 9E27F618EC40BEDBAFBA4FECC1EE84A8 - QakBot\ngood1.good - D5A5FB1FBDFEF257653D08A65AC7730A - QakBot\ngood2.good - 8EC26FF6330BF890190944DE65BD2B6B - QakBot\n\n## Resources\n\n[https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/10/squirrelwaffle-emerges.html](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/10/squirrelwaffle-emerges.html)\n[https://blog.cyberint.com/qakbot-banking-trojan](https://blog.cyberint.com/qakbot-banking-trojan)\n\n\n-----",
