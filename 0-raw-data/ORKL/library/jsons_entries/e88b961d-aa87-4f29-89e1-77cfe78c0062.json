DECEPTION TACTICS MUDDYING ATTRIBUTION IN TARGETED ATTACKS\n## Brian Bartholomew & Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade Kaspersky Lab, USA\n\n Email {brian.bartholomew, juan.guerrero}@ kaspersky.com\n\n ABSTRACT\n\nThis paper takes a comprehensive look at the current state of\nattribution in targeted attack research and at deliberate attempts\nby the adversary to obstruct this process. The paper includes\ncommon bases for attribution, practical and methodological\ncomplications, and examples of purposeful abuse by\nsophisticated threat actors in the wild.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nAttribution is often the most prominent point of interest and\ncontention when it comes to threat intelligence, both for direct\nrecipients and the general public alike. Despite this pervasive\ninterest, the attribution phase of the analysis cycle is little\nunderstood and the complications that arise therein are often\nignored. Similarly, the value of attribution remains largely\nunquestioned. We will not argue that attribution provides no\nvalue. However, a thorough study of the methods for arriving at\nattribution and the data available to reach these conclusions will\nreveal the shaky foundation of attribution in threat intelligence\nand hopefully prove a cautionary tale for threat intelligence\nproducers as well as recipients making decisions on the basis of\nattribution claims. At a time when ‘hacking back’ is discussed as\na legitimate option for victims, and governments are willing to\ntake heavy-handed geopolitical retribution on the basis of threat\nintelligence products, misattribution can have a hefty cost.\n\nMoreover, attackers aware of the reactions taken by victim\nnations and companies in the face of audacious attribution claims\nmay seek this tertiary effect purposefully. Acknowledging the\nspace for error in attribution, threat intelligence circles often\nraise this possibility under the vague threat of ‘false fl ag\noperations’. However, little has been provided publicly to\nsubstantiate this possibility. As part of our work in Kaspersky\n_Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT), we have_\nbeen uniquely positioned to witness both general and specifi c\ncases of manipulation of indicators by attackers of medium-toadvanced skill attempting to mislead researchers and other nosy\nonlookers. Rather than resort to innuendo, we will provide\nmultiple and diverse examples of manipulation that showcase the\nabuse potential currently being exploited by attackers in the wild.\n\nBy substantiating the case for false fl ags, we intend to raise a\ngeneral awareness of the complications involved in investigating\ntargeted attacks. We hope that these cautionary tales will also\nreach the consumers of threat intelligence products to temper\n\n\ntheir expectations and reactions to attribution claims and\nhopefully dull the edge currently leveraged by cunning attackers\ninterested in casting blame for their nefarious activities onto\nunsuspecting nation states or unrelated threat actors.\n\nWhat follows will cover the general approach to attribution and\nits basis. We will then present overviews of multiple examples of\npurposeful manipulation of attributory indicators to showcase\ndifferent forms of manipulation, each displaying varying degrees\nof cunning and success potential. Armed with these examples,\nwe will explore general and methodological complications.\nFinally, we discuss some general refl ections to further a deeper\ndiscussion of the value and risks of attribution for consumers and\nproducers alike.\n\n## ATTRIBUTING TARGETED ATTACKS\n\nThe expression ‘attribution is hard’ is often bandied about, either\napologetically or in jest. It’s easier than explaining that, in fact,\nattribution relies on a combination of fungible technical\nindicators, mistakes, overlaps, and luck. Sloppy or careless\noperators (such as those nation-state actors who believe they can\nact with impunity) are wont to provide more data than they\nshould, like debug paths and language strings, or to reuse\ninfrastructure from previous attacks, which allows researchers to\ngroup them into a threat actor cluster. Sometimes our luck is\nsuch that an IP address will point us at an incriminating location\nor we fi nd a widely reused handle rife with personal information.\nOther times, there are little to no indicators pointing us in any\nparticular direction. Attribution is an important part of the threat\nintelligence (TI) process but it isn’t one that can always be\nfulfi lled with any certainty.\n\nThough the analysis process adapts and changes on a case-tocase basis, we can discuss the most common bases for attribution\nclaims encountered during targeted attack research. What follows\nshould impress the reader as to the inexactitude and need for\ninterpretation in every step of the attribution process. Heaping\nseveral of these indicators together may paint a more cohesive\npicture but it is nonetheless a series of intuitions ideally (but not\nalways) pointing in the same direction. The question to keep in\nmind is ‘what makes a satisfactory attribution claim?’,\nparticularly the sort with such certainty as to justify further\naction (be it legislative, political, law enforcement, or retaliatory\nCNA)[1].\n\n## Timestamps\n\nA great benefi t of the Portable Executable fi le format is the\ninclusion of compilation times. Though these can be altered with\nease, many samples include original timestamps. Beyond an\nobvious indication of an actor’s longevity, timestamps allow for\nan understanding of specifi c campaigns as well as the evolution\nof an actor’s toolkit throughout the years. With a large enough\ncollection of related samples, it’s also possible to create a\ntimeline of the campaign operators’ workday. Where these\noperate in any professional setting or with any semblance of\ndiscipline, it’s possible to match the normal peaks and troughs of\na workday and pinpoint a general timezone for their operations.\n\n1 A topic further addressed in the fi nal section of this paper.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Strings, debug paths, and metadata\n\nMalware binaries often include several artifacts of their\nconstruction in the form of strings and debug paths. Even\nperfectly innocuous strings used to describe the normal\noperations of a backdoor can give away impressions of the\nmalware authors. The most obvious is their preferred language,\nparticularly when it comes to rare languages in the targeted\nattack landscape, but also indicating language profi ciency with\nbroken English showcasing the colloquial shortcomings of the\ncoder. Among these strings, a favourite of TI researchers is the\ndebug path: a string describing the folder structure leading up to\nfi les from the time of development that made its way into the\nfi nal binary. Debug paths most often reveal a username but may\nalso (in the case of organized coders) reveal internal naming\nconventions like internal tool, project or campaign names.\n\nAnother telling resource is the presence of metadata both in\nmalware binaries as well as dropper fi les like decoy or macro\ndocuments. From time to time, binary resources will contain\nlanguage IDs that refl ect the confi guration of the developer’s\nsystem in telling ways, perhaps pointing to the system’s native\nlanguage. Phishing documents are also often riddled with\nmetadata. Disciplined actors regularly employ virtual machines\nwith nondescript usernames and software registrations, usually\nrefl ecting the use of pirated software with common fi le\nattributes or resources pointing to generic, publicly traded\nexploit kits. However, metadata will occasionally include\noriginal user handles and unintentional save state information\nthat points to the actual author’s machine.\n\n## Infrastructure and backend connections\n\nA preferred method for grouping targeted attack activity\ntogether is through cataloguing of the malicious use of network\ninfrastructure. Command-and-control infrastructure can be\ncostly and diffi cult to maintain, with the added complication\nthat availability may be disrupted by researchers, law\nenforcement, or a spooked system administrator (in the case of\ncompromised infrastructure). Even well-resourced attackers\nhave a tendency for reusing command-and-control or phishing\ninfrastructure. For threat intelligence teams building databases\nof targeted attack-related infrastructure, this is often the most\ntelling sign of an attacker resurfacing or retooling. In rare\ninstances, multiple attack groups may go after the same\nvulnerable server (particularly with teams that insist on using\ncompromised infrastructure rather than mounting their own) but\nthis remains rare enough to be an outlier. The trend at this time\nremains that even in cases of infrastructure reuse between\nteams, these occur within the same threat actor cluster (as in the\ncase of multiple independent ‘Chinese-speaking’ threat actors\ngetting their hands on the same zero-days, some overlapping\ninfrastructure, or sharing lateral movement tools – a situation\nthat speaks more to the tasking arrangement or ‘community’ of\nattackers in this cluster than to a breakdown in attribution\nmethods).\n\nIn the case of researchers with a privileged point of view, such\nas those working with email services, ISPs, or those providing\nsupport for a compromised server, backend connections can be\na serendipitous and often telling attributory indicator. What we\n\n\nmean by ‘backend connections’ are connections that take place\nwhen an attacker retrieves data from an exfi ltration server or\nemail account, prepares a staging or phishing server, or checks\nin on a compromised domain to assure its continued availability.\nAttackers almost always use Tor or some other anonymizing\nservice to mask this connection but mistakes happen more often\nthan not. The mistake will likely provide researchers with an IP\nor a region telling of the native operations of the attacker.\n\n## Toolkits\n\n Malware families\n\nAlthough even the most advanced threat actors may rely on\npublicly available tools, most take the time to build their toolkits\nand develop custom backdoors, lateral movement tools, and\nexploits. Knowing the value of what they’ve developed, actors\nwill jealously guard their toolkit, thereby allowing researchers\nto hone in on a threat actor by the presence of a tightly\ncontrolled malware family. In simpler terms: if Snake is present\nthen it looks like Turla; if WildPositron malware is found then\nit’s probably Lazarus, and so on. It’s important to remember that\n‘malware ownership’ isn’t static. Just as the malware itself\ndevelops over time, the ownership may be transferred. It can be\nshared with other teams in the same cluster, developers may\nleave or set up their own shops, or source code may leak\nthrough a variety of circumstances.\n\n## Code reuse\n\nIn cases where an actor has been exposed or has found other\nmotivations for a top-down retooling, code reuse can indicate a\nrelationship between currently used tools and their predecessors.\nCoders can be quite lazy and even when the intention is a full\nretooling, malware developers will often reuse specifi c functions\nor pieces of code that have worked well in the past. This means\nthat the avid researcher or obsessive yara rule writer may be\nable to hone in on these traits and connect new and old\ncampaigns, or even seemingly unrelated threat actors.\n\n## Passwords\n\nA similar circumstance applies to the reuse of passwords. These\nmay be the passwords to email accounts used for phishing or\nexfi ltration, accounts on compromised servers, or hard-coded\npasswords in malware components. A recent example saw a\nthreat actor deploying droppers with password-protected\nresources that contained the actual payload in an attempt to\nthwart sandboxes and automatic detection systems. The\nhard-coded password protecting the resource was the same even\nwhen different, seemingly unrelated malware families were\nbeing dropped, thus allowing researchers to tie the two malware\nfamilies to the same actor. This also applies to hard-coded\nencryption keys in different malware families or campaigns.\n\n## Exploits\n\nFinally, zero-day exploits are a great source of excitement in\nresearch circles these days. The presence of an ‘0-day’\nimmediately sets an actor apart from the run-of-the-mill\nattackers, thus justifying greater researcher involvement.\n\n\n-----\n\nThough exploits may be repurposed or acquired from public\nsources, a greater emphasis on responsible disclosure has\nlimited the availability of the latter by dissuading the release of\nfully developed ‘proof-of-concept’ code that may aid attackers\nin leveraging newly discovered exploits[2]. That said, many\nadvanced attackers have exploit developers in house, with some\nthreat actors unleashing a seemingly unlimited supply of\nexploits where needed.\n\nWith a given exploit being an arcane and jealously guarded\nweapon in the attacker’s arsenal, home grown implementations\nof an exploit allow researchers to group together diverse\nmalware families or separate campaigns to a given cluster.\nWhen a specifi c implementation of a zero-day appears in\nseparate unrelated instances within a given timeframe (even\nlong after the zero-day was identifi ed and patched), it signifi es\ncode sharing likely pointing to the same actor or activity cluster.\nDespite discussions of parallel discovery [2] of exploits by\ndifferent vulnerability researchers in a given timeframe, exploit\nimplementations differ. However, this does not entirely discount\nthe possibility of a double-dealing seller in the black or grey\nmarket or other unexpected threat actor interactions like exploit\nrepurposing, as evidenced with Equation team’s reuse of\nCVE-2013-3918 within a couple of days of its initial use by the\nAurora actors [3]. One also cannot discount the nefarious\npossibility that a disclosed exploit repository itself has been\nhacked, as this represents a boon for an advanced attacker with\nindisputable return on investment.\n\n## Tasking\n\nA fi nal oft ignored tell of targeted attacks are the chosen targets\nthemselves as they represent the intent propelling forward a well\nresourced espionage operation. Though many indicators may be\nfaked or altered, the dynamic between attacker and victim is\nharder to hide or directly manipulate as it involves ‘real-world’\npublicly known circumstances or geopolitical confl icts. The\nthreat intelligence space represents an unprecedented\ncircumstance in which an unrelated third party with an\nunexpected vantage point can have situational awareness over\nlarge swathes of the targets of a secretive intelligence\norganization. For research teams with gifted analysts, this\ninsight allows for attacker profi ling. A possible outcome is the\nmapping of a campaign to a geopolitical or regional situation\nthat may point in the direction of a given perpetrating\norganization or nation. Or in the case of a resurgent retooled\nthreat actor, witnessing them revisiting the ‘old favourites’ can\nbe a telling sign connecting a new actor with a known cluster of\nactivity, particularly when the new attacks leverage previously\npilfered insights into the victim’s network or ‘pattern of life’.\n\nHowever, the study of tasking alone is largely interpretative and\nfaces common pitfalls derived from cognitive biases and\ngeopolitical oversimplifi cations, already familiar to intelligence\nanalysts. Further complications arise from the particularities of\ncertain targets and attackers alike. For example, some targets are\nso attractive by their very nature and position as to attract the\ninterest of several different actors simultaneously. Also, certain\n\n2 An example is the quick adoption by DarkHotel of a Flash zero-day\nfound in the reckless full release of the HackingTeam trove [1].\n\n\nthreat actor confi gurations break this paradigm entirely, as will\nbe discussed further in the next section.\n\n## A CUNNING MENAGERIE IN THE WILD\n\nIn order to delve into specifi c examples, we require two distinct\nallowances from the reader:\n\n - The fi rst regards the use of attribution examples. As should\nhave become apparent by now, attribution claims are far\nfrom certain and often sparsely substantiated. As part of a\ncompany and a research team that is cautious to remain\nattribution agnostic, we toe this line respectfully and with\ngood reason. In the process of discussing in-the-wild\nexamples of manipulation of attribution leads, it may be\nnecessary to point to commonly held beliefs or rumours as\nto the provenance of certain threat actors in order to\nshowcase where the indicators falter. We ask the reader to\ntreat these as what they are: rumours heard through the\nattribution grapevine, the sort of RUMINT that associates a\nthreat actor with a country, region, or organization. These\n_are not our own assertions or claims. We remain steadfast_\n_in our conviction of the complexities of the attribution_\n_problem and would prefer not to be quoted by overzealous_\n_readers as asserting attribution claims that are not our_\n_own. At times our own research may support these_\nintuitions but we do not go so far as to make these\nattribution claims our own.\n\n - Secondly, despite the liberties provided by an academically\ntoned industry publication, we remain bound by corporate\nrealities, respect for the research methods of collaborators,\nand, most of all, legal constraints. As such, we may not\nalways be able to provide full disclosure of indicators\ninvolved in certain fi ndings. As we do not seek to recreate\nthe process of each investigation, we feel these are not vital\nto convey the main thrust of our argument, which is that\nintermediate-to-advanced threat actors are aware of\nattribution methods and are already attempting to\nmanipulate researchers to expend limited resources chasing\nghost leads. Where gaps arise, let us relegate these accounts\nto camp fi re re-tellings among friends.\n\nWe thank the reader for these allowances, providing a lacuna\nbetween authors and content, in order to further a wider\ndiscussion about the complexities of attribution that could not\nhappen otherwise.\n\n## On language – Cloud Atlas\n\nIn December 2014, Blue Coat exposed a newly discovered\nmalware framework dubbed ‘Inception’ [4, 5], which was later\nattributed to a new actor named ‘Cloud Atlas’ [6]. Cloud Atlas is\nbelieved to have been born from a previous actor tracked as\n‘Red October’ [7]. Whether Cloud Atlas is the same actor or a\nspin-off of the original, this case posed some interesting\nanalytical problems when it came to attribution. The current\nbelief is that both teams are likely Eastern European-based and\nmost likely Russian-speaking. Cloud Atlas may be a spin-off\nfrom the original group following confl icts arising from the\nannexation of Crimea in the spring of 2014.\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring the investigation of this new campaign, various oddities\nwere discovered that seemed to disprove the belief that Cloud\nAtlas was Eastern European. It was only after analysing these\nbreadcrumbs in conjunction with each other that the\ndetermination was made that Cloud Atlas was most likely\n‘muddying the water’ in order to make attribution more diffi cult.\nTargeting seemed to fi t the original campaign, as the majority of\nattacks were heavily focused on Russia, specifi cally government\nand diplomatic entities. Very similar, if not identical lure\ndocuments were used in the two campaigns. Also, the\nimplementation of compression algorithms was nearly identical\nin both, with the Cloud Atlas version showing slight\nimprovement. But this is where the similarities stop, and the\nweirdness starts:\n\nOne of the early lure documents discovered in this campaign\npertained to Russian government offi cials but was titled in\n_Spanish. Further analysis of metadata from the original lure_\ndocument showed it was created on a native Spanish speaker’s\nsystem. Initially, this caused a bit of confusion, but it was later\ndetermined that the lure document was most likely stolen from\nan advisor in the Spanish Embassy in Moscow and repurposed\nfor use in attacks.\n\nThe infrastructure used by Cloud Atlas to manage victim data\nand implants was also interesting. The actors used a large pool\nof IP addresses in a ‘round robin’ fashion to access the cloudbased provider used to host payloads and store exfi ltrated data.\nGeolocation of the IP addresses showed the actors as mainly\noriginating from South Korea. Later analysis revealed that these\nIP addresses were mostly compromised home routers which\ncontained a small proxy implant.\n\nFocusing on language clues left behind in the malware caused\nfurther attribution issues, as confl icting indicators were\npeppered into the mobile implants:\n\n  - _Arabic strings in the BlackBerry version_\n\n  - _Hindi characters in the Android version_\n\n  - _God_Save_The_Queen was found in the BlackBerry version_\n\n - ‘JohnClerk’ was found in the project path for the iOS version\n\nThe presence of these various confl icting strings in different\nversions of the malware could either mean that the actors\nborrowed code from various sources to use in their implants, or\nthat the strings were purposely placed to misguide researchers.\n\nDuring the investigation, many researchers were running the\nvarious samples found in the wild in an effort to solicit a\nsecond-stage binary from the actors. In multiple instances, an\nimplant was served up to researcher machines that did not fi t the\ntypical Cloud Atlas framework. This implant showed\ncharacteristics of malware traditionally considered Chinese and\nused a command-and-control domain that was inactive at the\ntime. The belief is that the actors recognized researcher systems\nin their logs and instead of serving the normal second-stage\nbinary, they instead provided a ‘fake’, unrelated piece of\nmalware to cause confusion.\n\n_Blue Coat researchers did an excellent job in their original paper_\ndescribing the various paths attempted for attribution, only to hit\na dead end or to fi nd nonsense data. This is a great example of\n\n\nhow certain APT actors are aware of the indicators we as\nresearchers tend to latch onto, and are already purposely\nmodifying those characteristics.\n\n## On tasking – Wild Neutron\n\nWild Neutron[3] is a crowd favourite when it comes to\ncomplicated attribution research, complete with apocryphal\ntales and red herrings. Wild Neutron fi rst rose to prominence in\n2013 [8], though evidence shows the group was active as early\nas 2011. Their reputation is in large part thanks to their\nambitious targeting, bagging whales like Apple, Facebook,\n_Microsoft and Twitter. Their arsenal included multi-platform_\nmalware [9], a Java zero-day (CVE20130422), and a penchant\nfor well-chosen watering-hole sites. After close to a year of\nsilence, Wild Neutron returned for a 2015 campaign, this time\nwith a stolen digital certifi cate and a still undiscovered Flash\nzero-day exploit. Throughout, attribution has been a maze of\ncontradictory indications and false starts that continue to elude\nresearchers.\n\nSome of the simpler misleads are found in the Windows\nmalware where language strings were found both in Romanian\n(‘la revedere’ meaning ‘goodbye’) and Russian (‘uspeshno’, a\ntransliteration of ‘successfully’). Other leads include a false\nconnection to a well known researcher, connections to apparent\nscam artists, investment funds, and even a seemingly successful\ncryptocurrency scam[4]. But Wild Neutron presents a deeper\nchallenge for analysts than this particular hodgepodge of\nindicators, one that speaks to the possible nature of the threat\nactor as a mercenary entity. Usually a situation so convoluted\nwould fi nd some semblance of resolution by looking at the\nvictim spread, the sort of organizations and entities targeted by\nthe threat actor. In this case, the victim spread does little to\nassuage our uncertainty.\n\nLooking at Wild Neutron’s targeting, no one clear nexus of\ninterest is apparent:\n\n - Large company groups involved in M&A\n\n - Real estate companies\n\n - Bitcoin-related companies\n\n - Investment fi rms\n\n - IT companies\n\n - Healthcare companies\n\n - Law fi rms\n\n - Developers (iOS and Linux)\n\nWith victims in over 11 countries[5] and multiple verticals, we\ncan perhaps assume several different and possibly overlapping\nnexuses of interest that may suggest multiple tasking entities or\ndiverging mission imperatives. Another noteworthy observation\n\n3 Also known as: Morpho, Butterfl y, ZeroWing, or Jripbot.\n4 These attributory hypotheses and the supporting indicators are\npresented in the Kaspersky Private Intel Report on Wild Neutron pushed\nto subscribers in July 2015.\n5 Visibility courtesy of the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN)\nand Kaspersky sinkholes of Wild Neutron command-and-control\ninfrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nis the lack of victims in diplomatic or government institutions, a\ncustomary vertical for a threat actor of this calibre. This stands\nin juxtaposition to what is presumably counterterrorism tasking\nwith the compromise of the Ansar alMujahideen forum.\nResearchers concluded that the tasking was in line with a\nmercenary arrangement, taking tasking from different entities\nand imperatives, including a fi nancial incentive to pilfer\ntradeable fi nancial information on mergers and acquisitions.\nThis type of threat actor, while unlikely to remain rare, by its\nvery nature dismantles our ability to form a generalized\nattributory claim on the basis of tasking alone.\n\n## On hacktivism\n\nThe following examples are not intended as a particular\ncriticism of hacktivist tendencies themselves, but rather point to\nthe abuse potential in the prevalence of hacktivism as a\ncommonplace element in the Internet. Threat actors interested in\nmisleading the public and researchers alike with their disruptive\nactivities stand to benefi t from doing so under the cover of a\nhacktivist group. They are thereby afforded a cover of expected\nanonymity, plausible deniability, and the inherent legitimacy of\nan Internet-age societal force springing forth from a ground\nswell of ‘community sentiment’ (even when said community is\nnowhere to be found).\n\nThe following two threat actors have attempted this with\nvarying degrees of success:\n\n## Lazarus[6] the Weak\n\nThe Lazarus Group [10] represents a cluster of activity\nstretching back as far as 2009. From that time the group has\nengaged in a series of infamous attacks, most notably the\ndevastating wiping attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE)\nin 2014. Our fi ndings[7] tied this cluster together to contain a\nseries of malware families and campaigns suspected of sharing\nthe same provenance but not previously technically correlated.\nLooking at these different campaigns, we see a pattern emerge\ncharacterized by the use of unheard of hacktivist groups as\nself-assigned perpetrators of each attack. In the case of SPE, the\ngroup was ‘Guardians of Peace’ or GOP. We are meant to\nbelieve this is an established hacktivist group despite lacking a\nvisible presence or pedigree before or after the attack.\n\nSimilarly, the 2012 attack on the Korean newspaper JoongAng\n_Daily [11] that reportedly disrupted operations was plastered_\nwith the motto ‘Hacked by IsOne’, an unheard of attacker. 2013\nsaw wiper attacks on South Korean institutions [12] using\nmalware designed to overwrite fi les with Roman army terms\n‘HASTATI’ and ‘PRINCPES’[8] before corrupting the drive’s\nMaster Boot Record. Interestingly, these attacks were claimed\nby two unheard of groups, the ‘New Romantic Cyber Army\nTeam’ and the ‘WhoIs Team’ [14].\n\n6 Also known as DarkSeoul, Operation Troy, WildPositron and\nTEMP.Hermit, or in relation to the malware families Destover, Duuzer,\nHangman, and SpaSpe.\n7 Initially presented at the 2016 Kaspersky Lab Security Analysts\nSummit (SAS) in collaboration with AlienVault Labs’ Jaime Blasco.\n8 As noted by FireEye researchers, probably a misspelling of ‘Pricipes’,\na term for spearmen or swordsmen [13].\n\n\nDespite media coverage, the Lazarus Group’s insistence on\nemploying cover groups has done little to persuade onlookers\nfor long as to the provenance of these attacks. This is due, in\nlarge part, to the supposed perpetrators’ complete lack of\npedigree or prevailing Internet presence. Their lifespan is only\nthat of the attack in question. With no entity to trace, follow, or\ninterrogate, attention quickly turns to the more obvious\nperpetrator of these attacks. However, this misleading tactic has\nbeen better employed by another threat actor.\n\n## Sofacy the Strong\n\nOne of the most interesting groups in recent years has been\nSofacy[9]. Sofacy is widely believed to belong to a Russian\nintelligence organization, although this is still a subject of\ndebate. The group has vast resources at its disposal and has\nproduced copious numbers of zero-day exploits, especially in\nthe last three years. Targeting for Sofacy has changed over the\nyears in parallel with the Russian political climate and has\nincluded foreign government agencies (intelligence, military\nand civilian), suspected terrorism targets, media outlets (both\nforeign and domestic), non-governmental organizations\n(NGOs), and energy-based companies to name a few. What’s\nmost interesting about this group is their effectiveness at\nconducting deception operations in an effort to afford their\nsponsors some level of plausible deniability. We will address\nthree instances in which Sofacy is believed to have employed a\nfalse front in order to mask its true intentions. As mentioned\nbefore, due to the sensitivity of specifi c data and sources, we\nwill not reconstruct our investigations to prove these are, in fact,\nacts of Sofacy, but rather present the narrative in the hope of\nsupporting a wider debate.\n\n**_CyberBerkut_**\n\nIn March 2014, a supposedly Ukrainian-based, pro-Russian\nseparatist group calling itself CyberBerkut rose to prominence\nby conducting various attacks against the Ukrainian government\nand other entities supporting Ukraine during the annexation of\nCrimea [15]. The group was extremely active in 2014 and 2015,\ntargeting not only local Ukrainian government and\ninfrastructure, but also NATO resources, US defence companies,\nand the German Bundestag to name a few. While the group\noperated under the guise of being part of the larger Anonymous\ncollective, further research has indicated that this may not have\nbeen the case. Some researchers in the community have\nindicated that a connection between Sofacy and CyberBerkut\nexists [16], with others going as far as stating they are one and\nthe same. When looking at the timeline of events leading up to\nthe annexation of Crimea and the confl ict in Donbass, one can\ncertainly make the argument that the actions of CyberBerkut\nalign closely with Russian interests.\n\nOn 22 February 2014, then President Viktor Yanukovych was\nousted by the Ukrainian parliament. Yanukovych eventually fl ed\nand later surfaced in exile in southern Russia. Following this, on\n25 February, the special police forces in Ukraine known as\n‘Berkut’ were dissolved by parliament. In the following weeks,\nunidentifi ed gunmen, widely believed to be Russian soldiers,\n\n9 Also known as APT28, Tsar Team and Pawn Storm, among others.\n\n\n-----\n\nseized control of various checkpoints and airports throughout\nCrimea. Around the same time (3 March 2014), the domain\ncyberberkut[.]org was created and the group made its fi rst\npublic appearance. Before this date, there is no known data\nshowing that the group or its members existed in any capacity.\nThis becomes relevant when looking at the other examples\ngiven later in this section, as hacktivist groups tend to have\nsome kind of history supporting their lineage.\n\nSome of CyberBerkut’s attacks also coincidentally targeted the\nsame victims as Sofacy. In January 2015, CyberBerkut\nconducted attacks against multiple German government\nwebsites, including the German Bundestag [17]. Subsequently,\nin May 2015, the Bundestag was also attacked by what was later\nconfi rmed by the German government as Sofacy [18]. While it\nis not uncommon for two actors to target the same victim, the\nargument could be made that both attacks were conducted by\nthe same actors, or possibly that some type of ‘trade-off’\noccurred between the two.\n\n**_CyberCaliphate_**\n\nOn 24 December 2014, a new pro-ISIS hacktivist group by the\nname of CyberCaliphate announced its presence by taking\ncontrol of the Albuquerque Journal’s mobile application and\nbroadcasting propaganda to its subscribers [19]. Then, on 12\nJanuary 2015, CyberCaliphate seized control of the United\nStates Central Command (USCENTCOM)’s Twitter and\n_YouTube accounts [20]. In February 2015, they proceeded to_\ncompromise Newsweek’s Twitter account [21] and also sent\npropaganda text messages to subscribers using WBOC\n_Maryland’s text alert system [22]. Following these attacks, in_\nApril 2015, the group lashed out again, this time against a\nFrench television station, TV5 Monde [23], where they were\nable to block broadcasts for 11 stations and seize control of the\nTV station’s social media accounts.\n\nWhile initial speculation pointed to this being yet another\npro-ISIS group attempting to spread their propaganda to the\nmasses, further research turned up interesting data that\npotentially pointed to a Russian entity, specifi cally Sofacy, as\nthe real culprit. First, there was no evidence of the group’s\nexistence prior to the initial attacks in January. As stated\npreviously, it is not typical for a hacktivist group to have no\npedigree or lineage prior to a large defacement such as\nUSCENTCOM. Secondly, FireEye later revealed that the IP\naddress of the website where data from the TV5Monde hack was\npublished was part of the same netblock of previously known\nSofacy infrastructure [24]. Additionally, other sources have\nshown that the registrant information used to register the\ngroup’s offi cial domain cyb3rc[.]com is linked to other\nwell-known Sofacy domains.\n\nWhile the exact motivation is unknown, it is believed that\nCyberCaliphate was created to provide the Sofacy actors a\nway to conduct psychological operations against certain\ntargets of interest while providing a level of plausible\ndeniability. Whatever the case may be, if it weren’t for a\ncouple of small errors on the part of the actors,\nCyberCaliphate could have remained a useful front for their\noperations.\n\n\n**_Yemen Cyber Army_**\n\nIn the wake of the success of the CyberCaliphate campaign,\nanother hacktivist group emerged: Yemen Cyber Army (YCA)\nappeared in May 2015. As with the other two groups, YCA also\nhad no prior history and its members were completely unknown.\nThey proclaim to be a hacktivist group operating out of Yemen,\nspecifi cally supporting the Houthi movement and possessing\nstrong anti-Saudi sentiments.\n\nSaudi Arabia mounted a bombing effort in March 2015 against\nYemen to suppress the ongoing Houthi forces that were\novertaking Yemen’s government in Sana’a. Shortly after this\ncampaign in April 2015, the website of the London-based\n_AlHayat newspaper was defaced by YCA. Subsequently, in May_\n2015, the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs was also hacked by\nYCA and thousands of internal communications were published\non Wikileaks. Many researchers currently believe YCA is an\nIranian-led front to cause damage and spread propaganda\nagainst the Saudi government, but after investigating the group\nand its activities further, a new theory has surfaced, indicating\nthat this is potentially another campaign orchestrated by Sofacy.\nWhile there is no solid proof showing that this is, in fact, Sofacy\nand not Iran, we point to factors that may shed some light in\nfavour of the former.\n\nFirst, it is important to understand the relationship between\nRussia and Saudi Arabia. Saudi is arguably one of the top\nnemeses of the Russian government, dating as far back as the\n1980s when Saudi supported the Mujahideen during the\nSoviet-Afghan war. Saudi is a key US ally in the Middle East\nand also allied with other countries in the region that do not\nhold close diplomatic relations with Moscow. In February 2015,\nSaudi deployed fi ghter jets to Turkey for use in ground-based\noperations in Syria to support the militant opposition. Also\nduring this time, Russia openly accused Saudi of depressing oil\nprices in an effort to tank the Russian economy.\n\nAll of this speaks to the potential motive of why Russia would\nbe very much interested in damaging the Saudi government.\n\nAround the same time, in February 2015, Sofacy was discovered\nusing a zero-day exploit against a select few targets, one of\nthese being the Saudi Embassy in Ukraine. This exploit was\nused in the wild only by Sofacy until April 2015, when\n_Microsoft fi nally patched it. The very limited use of this exploit_\nduring this time frame, combined with the fact that the Saudi\nEmbassy was actively being targeted, shows a very real\npossibility that Sofacy had access to the Saudi Ministry of\nForeign Affairs networks as early as February 2015.\n\nAnother interesting tie to Sofacy is a domain that was\nestablished by YCA in June 2015 (wikisaleaks[.]com). This\ndomain was registered using privacy-protected services, but\ndigging behind the protection revealed that the email registrant\nused for this domain was ‘nghockeng@yandex.com’, the same\nas was used to register three other domains utilized by YCA\n(yemenica[.]com, yemenica[.]org, and yemenica[.]net). While\nthis specifi c registrant has never directly been tied to known\nSofacy domains, the use of Yandex email accounts is a favourite\nfor the group. Also interesting are the nameservers used for\nwikisaleaks[.]com. This domain utilizes nameservers from\n\n\n-----\n\norderboxdns[.]com, which is also a highly favoured provider for\nSofacy. Further digging revealed that the domain is being hosted\nat 87.236.215.129. While this IP address has never been used by\nSofacy before, the subnet is also a favourite of the group’s. The\nfollowing are some other IP addresses in the same subnet used\nby Sofacy in past attacks:\n\n87.236.215.13 87.236.215.60 87.236.215.99\n\n87.236.215.102 87.236.215.132 87.236.215.134\n\n87.236.215.143 87.236.215.246\n\nAs stated above, while none of these observations represent the\nproverbial ‘nail in the coffi n’, in combination they strengthen\nthe claim that Sofacy could be behind YCA, just as it has been\nwith the prior two campaigns. Another possibility is that Sofacy\ncould be providing information and assistance to an Iranianbased group as they may share an interest in damaging the\nSaudi government. Whatever the case, Sofacy has displayed a\npredilection and gift for running effective deception campaigns\nagainst targets of interest, and is likely to continue to do so.\n\n## On blame shifting\n\nThe following threat actors have chosen a different tactic.\nRather than persuade researchers into thinking that their attacks\nare the work of a different category, lesser calibre player, these\nthreat actors instead attempt to cast the blame onto another\nrecognizable nation-state actor. The attempts are presented in\nrising order of perceived effectiveness.\n\n## Duqu 2.0\n\nThe formidable Duqu was fi rst discovered in 2011 by\n_CrySyS Lab and extensively researched by GReAT. The initial_\nnotoriety of Duqu was largely due to the malware’s relationship\nto Stuxnet, with specifi c modules displaying traits of shared\ndevelopment indicative of the Tilded platform. But Duqu is most\nadmirable for its audacity, as displayed by the choice of infecting\na Hungarian digital certifi cate authority in order to solve an\noperational requirement. Appreciative of GReAT’s admiration, as\nconveyed through more than half a dozen blog posts and\nextensive analysis, the legendary threat actor resurged by\nhand-delivering a vastly improved version of the malware to our\ndoorstep. This time around, Duqu was equipped with up to three\nzero-day exploits including a kernel exploit (CVE-2015-2360),\nmemory-resident malware signed with a stolen digital certifi cate,\nand a unique persistence philosophy cognizant of the victim as a\nnetwork rather than a collection of independent victim machines\n\n[25]. Other unwitting recipients of this gift included venues for\nP5+1 talks, industrial control systems-related companies, and\ntelecommunications providers [26].\n\nDuqu 2.0 is entirely modular, spanning upwards of 100 plug-in\nvariants, with separate modules to handle specifi c operations\nlike communications with command-and-control infrastructure\nand tunnelling directly into the victim’s LAN. Among the latter\nis an NDIS fi lter driver internally named ‘termport.sys’[10], whose\nfunctionality is toggled by packets that include the hard-coded\nmagic string, ‘romanian.antihacker’ in the 32-bit driver. The\n64-bit version, on the other hand, uses ‘ugly.gorilla’: a reference\n\n10 The fi lename at time of deployment was changed to ‘portserv.sys’.\n\n\nto a member of Comment Crew/APT1 [27]. Wang Dong, known\nby the alias ‘Jack Wang’ or the handle ‘Ugly Gorilla’, was one\nof the fi ve PLA offi cers indicted [28] by a US grand jury in\n2014 on 31 criminal counts related to computer abuse activities.\nThough APT1/Comment Crew remains active to this day,\npresumably with Wang Dong amongst its ranks, the idea that\nthey are behind the Duqu 2.0 attacks is patently ridiculous.\n\nApart from a series of attributory indicators pointing in an\nentirely different direction, the APT1 group would have needed\nto get their hands on the original Duqu source code given the\nstructural similarities in some modules of the new platform. The\nmore likely explanation is that the threat actor noted the greater\nrisk posed by a device driver (compared to the memory-resident\nmodules) and peppered some false fl ags to misguide incident\nresponders. By citing a publicly indicted member of a well\nknown and widely reported APT crew, the Duqu developers\nmay have mislead an IR team whose technical expertise in the\narea of threat intelligence amounted to Google searching binary\nstrings with no greater awareness of the threat landscape to\ndraw from.\n\n## TigerMilk\n\nThe mysterious TigerMilk[11] actor is a thus far unattributed,\nprivately reported discovery. The campaign started in early\n2015, targeting Peruvian institutions and entities exclusively for\na period of six months. The attacker used a commonplace\nexploit (CVE-2012-0158) in conjunction with a curriculum\nvitae stolen from a local victim in order to infect users with\ncustom credential-stealing malware. The position-independent\nbackdoor was injected into processes like explorer.exe and\nvarious browsers. In 64-bit systems, the malware would spawn a\nseparate desktop with its own infected explorer.exe to avoid\nsuspicion. However, in operation the malware was clunky and\ncaused perceptible instability so neither the development nor the\nintended functionality were indicative of a sophisticated actor.\nSo why mention TigerMilk?\n\nThe one particular feature of TigerMilk that makes it\nnoteworthy is its use of a notorious digital certifi cate. Every\nbackdoor deployed is signed with the same stolen Realtek\ncertifi cate[12] as Stuxnet(.a/.b). The samples were compiled and\nsigned long after the certifi cate’s validity expired[13], thereby\nobviating its use as a means of bypassing execution controls. As\nsuch, the only imaginable value of signing these samples with\nthis particular certifi cate is to fool incident responders and\nresearchers into casting blame on the notorious Stuxnet team for\nan attack on Peruvian military and government institutions.\nMoving beyond this basic deception, the true unresolved\nmystery of TigerMilk is: how did this new actor get its hands on\nthis specifi c certifi cate?\n\n## The man behind the curtain\n\nOne of the most advanced and prolifi c known threat actors is the\nTurla group. They have existed in some shape or form since at\n\n11 The private TigerMilk report was pushed to Kaspersky Intel Report\nsubscribers in November 2015.\n12 Serial number: 5e 6d dc 87 37 50 82 84 58 14 f4 42 d1 d8 2a 25.\n13 12 June 2010.\n\n\n-----\n\nleast 2006, but some speculate that their true origins may be as\nmuch as a decade earlier. It’s widely accepted that Turla is a\nstate-sponsored actor originating from Russia. What makes\nTurla so fascinating is the group’s attention to detail, operational\nsecurity, and advanced tactics for victim data exfi ltration.\nDuring one specifi c incident in November 2012, the Turla group\nshowed their willingness to engage in deception tactics when\ncornered.\n\nTurla compromised a handful of victims during this campaign,\nbut one particular European victim proved especially enticing.\nThe group had deployed their typical fi rst-stage malware,\nWipbot, on the victim’s system and began their normal routine\nof collection and monitoring. At some point, the victim became\nsuspicious and decided to engage their incident response (IR)\nteam to investigate their network and determine the source of\nnefarious activity. The IR team began their normal process of\nsurveying the system and running various investigative tools,\nhowever, they did not pull the system offl ine. Turla became\naware that they would soon be discovered. At this point, most\nactors would simply uninstall their malware from the victim and\nmove on. Instead, Turla decided to have a bit of fun with the IR\nteam in an attempt to cover their tracks.\n\nThey proceeded to utilize Wipbot to download and install a\nsecond-stage binary. But this was no ordinary Turla malware,\nrather they installed a somewhat rare, already compiled piece of\nChinese malware by the name of Quarian. The Quarian malware\ncommunicated back with infrastructure located in Beijing,\nwhich was neither under Turla’s control nor related to previous\nTurla operations. They then proceeded to uninstall the Wipbot\nmalware and erase their tracks from the victim systems.\n\nThis proved to be a great move on their part, as the IR team\nspent countless hours tracking down the Quarian malware and\nassuming the victim had been targeted by a Chinese-based APT\ngroup. Because they used a lesser-known piece of malware, the\ninvestigators fi rst had to identify the family, then dig through the\nsprawling infrastructure in search of some level of attribution.\nAll of this work was obviously pointless and served as a\nfantastic smoke screen for Turla’s retreat.\n\n## A COMPLICATED LANDSCAPE\n\nBeyond the particulars of an investigation or the cunning of a\ngiven actor, attribution suffers from a variety of complications\nranging through varying external motivators, inherent\nlimitations, and methodological disparities across vendors and\nresearch teams. This merits a more high-level discussion of\nconditions complicating attribution in targeted attacks. The\nintended takeaway is that attributory analysis is far from\nstraightforward, largely hermeneutic, and in no way a standard\npractice at this time.\n\n## General complications\n\n Your sexiest attribution, please\n\nThe private threat intelligence production landscape involves\nvarious intertwined forces that arise from an interplay between\nprivate industry, private and public consumers, and public\nattention. Various motivations arise within this interplay, most\n\n\nnotably that of the value of media attention and free PR, which\nhas proven a notable motivator for the rise of threat intelligence\nproduction in the anti-malware industry. While some TI teams\nhave arisen out of the need for in-house elite researchers to deal\nwith sophisticated attacks, many have followed from the\nrealization that TI products garner heavy media attention with\ninherent marketing value. Judgment for this tactic is dampened\nby recognition of its value in motivating the awareness and\nadoption of the need for mature threat intelligence in an industry\nwhere even corporate giants and leaders in technology products\nhave been less than willing to devote even meagre resources to\ntackle a complex, demanding, and ever-evolving problem.\n\nHowever, as is often the case with easy value-added ventures,\nabuse is quick to follow, as immature threat intelligence\nproducers (often never-before-seen start-ups) have taken the\nstage with bombastic, absurd, and unverifi able attribution claims\nfor the sake of headline stories that bring their companies to\nmomentary prominence. These stories will serve as an excuse to\napproach or even extort potential victims-cum-customers whose\ndismayed IT teams are forced to spend precious limited\nresources chasing down nebulous leads for the sake of due\ndiligence to reassure an anxious C-suite of the continued\nintegrity of their systems, reputation and intellectual property.\nThese tactics have borne ephemeral fruit not only with claims of\nsophisticated attacks but also presumed breaches, larger-thanlife credential dumps, and ghost botnets.\n\nThis is not the only case where an eager but sometimes\ntechnically naïve media machine is abused to the detriment of\nthe threat intelligence production landscape. In an effort to\nfoster a sense of balanced debate, media outlets have entertained\nany sign of contention in the research community, lending\ncredence to doubt even where there is little ambiguity and\nbreeding a class of pundits charitably referred to as professional\n_cyber-truthers, who have built careers on the basis of sparsely_\nsubstantiated contrarian attributory claims. While legitimate\ndisagreement in the research community should not be\ndiminished, we should also acknowledge the prevalence of\nsniping between competing vendors, the anti-anti-malware\npeanut gallery, and other skeptics eager to disparage popular\nresearch at face value.\n\nIn response, larger outfi ts are increasingly adopting a\nclosed-door approach to the distribution of threat intelligence\nproducts, or the partial withholding of signifi cant details\nintended solely for paying customers – an approach with\nobvious benefi ts and latitude for expression, but one that’s also\nprone to validation issues as the value of the research product\ncannot be verifi ed by qualifi ed third parties[14]. On the off-chance\nthat a given vendor’s products prove dubious or inconsequential\nfor a single-source consumer, this can lead to an erosion of trust\nin threat intelligence as a whole.\n\n## The one-eyed man is king\n\nThe very nature of threat intelligence results from a fascinating\ninjection of third-party observers into the dynamic between an\nattacker and victim, often by chance. This serendipitous\n\n14 Discussed as a validation crisis likely to arise in threat intelligence\n\n[29].\n\n\n-----\n\ninterplay may be the result of a contractual placement of\ndefence solutions in the victim’s network, the maintenance of\nservice infrastructure (as in the case of ISPs and webmail, cloud\nor storage providers), or by stumbling upon attack artifacts\nfound on multi-scanners, staging servers, or through their\nfoolishly wide distribution, in the case of hamfi sted attackers.\n\nThe implicit takeaway is that the position of the threat\nintelligence producer will shape the nature of the research by\nvirtue of limited visibility. All possible producers inevitably\nsuffer from varying degrees of limited visibility. This often\nmeans that two different similarly positioned companies possess\ndifferent incomplete parts of the same operation, that endpoint\nsecurity companies see payloads with no network traffi c, that\nISPs see network traffi c and victimology but no payloads, and\nso on. To then claim perfect awareness over a given campaign\nwill prove short-sighted folly, given that little deters the same\nactors from continuing their efforts, often retooling and\ntargeting the same victims. Failures become apparent as\nalternate reports contain vaguely overlapping IOCs that\nshowcase the incompleteness of a single-source report and\nextended campaigns against a given victim may abuse\npreviously unseen attacker capabilities possibly witnessed by\nother vendors.\n\n## Analyst training\n\nAn often ignored facet of the threat intelligence production cycle\nis the role of the analyst whose purpose is to coalesce various\nsources of information, arrive at various conclusions, and vet the\noverall logic of the fi nished product. Sadly, at this stage in the\nrise of the threat intelligence industry, defi cient hiring practices\noveremphasize specialized technical knowledge and eschew\ngeneralist broad-thinking capabilities, often assuming technical\ncandidates will bring these in tow. This is seldom the case, as\nshowcased by talented malware reverse engineers who don’t\nconsider themselves ‘threat hunters’, as well as by outlets\npromulgating technical malware breakdowns who fail to identify\nthe connection of these artifacts with larger campaigns.\n\nThreat intelligence analysts often suffer from defi cient training\nin conventional intelligence analysis. Industry forums and\nconferences are heavily populated with trainings and ample\nresources aimed at fostering skills such as reverse engineering\nand ‘threat hunting’ that are essential to the production process,\nbut among these little is exclusively aimed at fostering the\nbroad-thinking methodologies necessary to turn technical\nindicators and victimology into a reliable estimative and\nactionable consumable product. Many military and intelligence\nmetaphors and models are suggested at this stage but these are\nstill reliant on the ability of the analyst to weigh different\npossibilities and scenarios, keeping excitement for a given\ntheory at bay, and allowing for accurate estimative language to\nmake its way to the fi nal recipient.\n\nIn simpler terms, it’s necessary to state that a hunch is a hunch,\nthat some conclusions are sparsely sourced or cannot be\nindependently arrived at, or that no conclusion can be made at\nthis time. There exist a handful of exemplary threat intelligence\nveterans whose familiarity with previous operations allows them\nto express high accuracy intuitions that speak to the provenance\n\n\nof targeted attacks; the remainder of us mere mortals must be\nable to follow the logical foundations of a theory to arrive at an\naccurate action plan that can independently be sustained by the\nconsuming IT and IR teams.\n\n## METHODOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS\n\n Scope\n\nEven among seasoned threat intelligence producers, signifi cant\ndisagreements arise. Investigating a targeted attack is a largely\nhermeneutic endeavour as researchers interpret sparse fragments\nand indicators to understand the means, capabilities and\n(hopefully) the intentions of the attackers. A common pitfall\narises from a lack of consensus on whether a given threat actor\nis defi ned by a shared toolkit, overlapping infrastructure, or\nsimilarities of tasking. The disagreement is most visible in\ndisparate naming schemes across vendors, an issue that isn’t as\nsuperfi cial as picking a shared name when differences in\nvisibility are coupled with one vendor’s insistence to categorize\nan actor by their shared use of a given lateral movement tool\nwhile another vendor focuses on a cluster of phishing\ninfrastructure. The issue extends beyond mere preference to\nrefl ect a heterogeneous understanding of the scope and intended\nfunctionality of threat intelligence products.\n\n## Functionality\n\nFurther complications arise when considering the variable\nintended functionality of threat intelligence products. Is the\nintended purpose PR value, enterprise defence, or cyber\nsituational awareness? Each of these is a legitimate purpose but\nnot all are equally served by the same product. We touched upon\nthe complications that arise with seeking PR value, which tends\nto require audacious attribution claims that stand in confl icting\nopposition to the alternatives mentioned. A product intended to\nsupport an audacious claim particularly through wide and loud\ndistribution will cripple its own actionable value as it spooks the\nattacker. The likely reaction is also a general retooling that\ncripples any prolonged awareness or ability to track a known\ndetermined malicious actor.\n\nOn the other hand, defending an enterprise network gains little\nfrom country-level attribution claims. By its very nature, the\ninstitution is endowed with little latitude to retaliate against a\nnation state no matter what the injustice of a cyber-espionage or\nsabotage campaign. Defending the enterprise requires\ncampaign-level understanding that includes an awareness of\ninfection vectors, toolkits, and attacker standard practices.\nLoosening the grip of a specifi c campaign will then allow the\nvictim enterprise to switch to tracking the threat actor or related\nactor cluster in preparation for the future attempts that will\nalmost certainly come.\n\nFinally, in the case of the larger project of cyber situational\nawareness, there are requirements that sometimes stand in\njuxtaposition to both the media imperatives and the defence of\nany particular entity. With the most cunning and resilient actors,\ntracking may well require an infection not to be cleared\nimmediately, so as not to spook the actor being hunted.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnderstanding that some threat actors are so cunning and well\nresourced that playing network ‘whack-a-mole’ is unlikely to\ndeter them in the least, researchers stand to benefi t from quiet\nobservation and the deployment of radical tailored defence\nsolutions rather than the simple disinfection of a given machine.\nThough this approach may be shocking to those critics who\nconsider the single role of anti-malware to be that of machine\ndisinfection, it is important to consider the heavy weaponry\ncommanded by actors of this calibre. Exemplary ‘god mode’style zero-day exploits are a concern for an entire software\necosystem and not just a single victim. In turn, these require a\nlarge-scale immune response, beginning with the discovery and\nunderstanding of the technique leveraged, propelled in priority\nby its abuse in the wild, and only then postulated for resolution\nby the software behemoths that support the relevant codebase.\nThe role of the anti-malware industry here extends beyond\nsimple metrics and immediate customer obligations to that of\ndefenders of the larger ecosystems in the face of unscrupulous\nactors.\n\nGiven an understanding of how the intended audience shapes\nthe research imperative and thereby the consumable product,\nthere is a need for research teams to defi ne their intended\naudience during the production cycle itself and not after.\n\n## REFLECTIONS\n\nThreat intelligence has true value beyond the current hype of\nan emerging pocket in the information security industry. As\nshowcased by the multiple examples presented of abuse in the\nwild, there is a need for professionals whose job it is to\nunderstand the apex predators in the malware ecosystem. In\njuxtaposition to IT and IR teams whose overlapping\nresponsibilities in responding to attacks are sometimes\nconsidered capable of obviating the need for TI, the latter is\nthe sole producer of the historical context that helps mitigate\nthe attackers’ potential ability to manipulate responders into\nchasing down ghosts, by virtue of familiarity and a broadthinking methodology. In place of a summary conclusion, we\ninstead leave open questions in need of deeper refl ection, on\nthe part of both producers and consumers of threat\nintelligence, to serve as our fi nal takeaways in furthering a\nmuch needed conversation.\n\n## What is solid attribution?\n\nConsidering the common bases for attribution, limitations in\nvisibility specifi c to each research camp, and requirements\nspecifi c to each type of customer, what could possibly make a\nsatisfactory attribution claim? We must ask ourselves if there\ncan even be such a thing. In a hypothetical scenario where we\nhave packets captured en route (as in the common jab ‘PCAP or\nGTFO’), could it not be a backdoored system being used to\nproxy through? Where we catch a nation-state operator\nred-handed, would we not need an understanding of the\nprovenance of their tasking? More realistically, there will never\nbe a solid enough attribution claim for everyone to get behind.\nRather, the combination of multiple indicators helps an analyst\nmake an educated determination of the trustworthiness or\naccuracy of a claim. This further highlights the importance of\n\n\nestimative language that allows others to make strategic\ndecisions based on preferably unbiased facts with the analyst’s\nopinion as a guide.\n\n## What is actually needed?\n\nA more sobering metric for attribution claims rests in\nunderstanding the action capability of the intended recipient.\nWhat can a single non-governmental entity do with the name\nof a nation-state operator? How does it bolster its defensive\nstance against further attack to be told which Chinese citizen\nto peg on its dartboard? On the other hand, a government\n(whose recourse includes diplomatic, legal, and even\nretributory CNO) stands to benefi t from the greatest possible\nlevel of fi delity in attribution. The question ‘what do you\nactually need?’ has to be answered in relation to ‘who are you\nmeant to be serving?’. The guiding principle remains the\nproduction of actionable intelligence and not the feeding of\n‘cyber-voyeurism’ and grandstanding.\n\n## Who can really do attribution?\n\nThe attribution limitations do not apply to all producers\nequally. If a ‘PCAP’ is considered the ultimate measure of\nattack fi delity, then what entity is more supremely positioned\nto perform attribution than the modern SIGINT agencies?\nThese ‘gods of the wires’ are positioned in such a way as to\nenact near perfect recall when an attack is discovered, either\nby snooping on the wires or having ‘popped’ the routers in a\ncountry of interest. In true Greek irony, the Cassandras of the\nmodern age are hamstrung by their own Apollonian curse: as\nintelligence agencies they are blessed with the ability to see\nbut not to publicly substantiate, the gift to attribute without\nbeing believed.\n\n## Who are you hacking back?\n\nFinally, for anyone holding out hope that anything like\n‘cyber-retribution’ can ever legitimately enter the stage for\nprivate entities, we hope to have provided enough reason for\nample skepticism. In a world where solid attribution claims in\nthe private sector are unlikely, how does one go about ‘hacking\nback’? Moreover, with cunning attackers manipulating victims\ninto casting blame towards an unrelated entity, who’s to blame\nwhen misattribution leads to a retributory attack on another\nblameless victim?\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n[1] Darkhotel’s attacks in 2015.
