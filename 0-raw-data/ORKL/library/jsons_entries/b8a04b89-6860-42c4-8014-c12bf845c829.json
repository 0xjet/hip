The RAT also let users view what victims were typing on their\nkeyboards, disable security software, and secretly activate the webcam on the target’s\ncomputer.\n\nGrubbs, who went by the pseudonym “KFC Watermelon,” began selling the tool in May\n2015. By mid-2017 he’d sold LuminosityLink to more than 8,600 customers, according to\n[Europol, the European Union’s law enforcement agency.](https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/international-crackdown-anti-spyware-malware)\n\n[Speculation that Grubbs had been arrested began surfacing last year after KFC Watermelon](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/02/unit42-rat-trapped-luminositylink-falls-foul-vermin-eradication-efforts/)\n[stopped responding to customer support queries on Hackforums[dot]net, the Web site where](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=hackforums&x=0&y=0)\nhe primarily sold his product.\n\n\n-----\n\nGrubbs, using the hacker nickname “KFC Watermelon,” advertised and sold his RAT via\n\nHackforums.net.\n\nThe sale and marketing of remote access tools, also known as remote administration tools,\nis not illegal in the United States, and indeed there are plenty of such tools sold by legitimate\ncompanies to help computer experts remotely administer computers.\n\nHowever, these tools tend to be viewed by prosecutors instead as “Remote Access Trojans”\nwhen their proprietors advertise the programs as hacking devices and provide customer\nsupport aimed at helping buyers deploy the RATs stealthily and evade detection by antimalware programs.\n\nAccording to the indictment against him, Grubbs “recruited and encouraged co-conspirators\nto answer questions on Skype, an internet messaging service, from potential and actual\npurchasers of LuminosityLink seeking to use the software to get unauthorized and\nundetected access to victim computers and steal information.”\n\n[Linking Grubbs to LuminosityLink was likely not a tall hurdle for prosecutors. A public filing at](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ky/0954545)\nthe Kentucky Secretary of State office lists Grubbs as the owner of Luminosity Security\n**Solutions LLC.**\n\nHowever, there are indications that Luminosity was not Grubbs’ first foray into making and\n[selling malware tools. According to a February 2018 blog post by Palo Alto Networks, the](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/02/unit42-rat-trapped-luminositylink-falls-foul-vermin-eradication-efforts/)\nSkype account connected to KFC Watermelon’s identity on Hackforums is tied to the email\naddress “codyjohnson1337@live.com; that email account was used in 2013 to register\n“plasmarat.pw,” a similar RAT sold and marketed on Hackforums.\n\n\n-----\n\nKFC Watermelon’s Skype profile (the “HF” in his Skype name is a likely reference to HackForums,\n\nwhere both Luminosity RAT and Plasma RAT were primarily sold and marketed).\n\nThe street address listed by the Kentucky Secretary of State’s office for Luminosity Security\nSolutions (127 Circle Dr., Stanford, KY) shows up in the original registration records for\ndozens of domains, including at least a half-dozen that early on listed the email address\n**coltongrubbs@gmail.com. That same email address appears in the early registration**\nrecords for [barracudasec[dot]com, a domain that as far back as 2012 was identified as a](https://www.exposedbotnets.com/2012/10/chatbarracudaseccom-barracuda-ircbotnet.html)\npopular “command and control” server that many denizens of Hackforums used to remotely\nadminister large numbers of remotely commandeered computers or “bots.”\n\nAround the time that KFC Watermelon stopped responding to support requests on\n[Hackforums, federal prosecutors were securing a guilty plea against Taylor Huddleston, a](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/02/bot-roundup-avalanche-kronos-nanocore/)\nthen 27-year-old programmer from Arkansas who sold the “NanoCore RAT.” Like Grubbs,\nHuddleston initially pleaded not guilty to computer intrusion charges, arguing that he wasn’t\nresponsible for how customers used his products. That is, until prosecutors presented Skype\nlogs showing that Huddleston routinely helped buyers work out how to use the tools to\nsecretly compromise remote computers.\n\nGrubbs’ guilty plea could well lead to further arrests and prosecutions of customers who\npurchased and used LuminosityLink. Case in point: The author of the Blackshades\n**Trojan — once a wildly popular RAT sold principally on Hackforums — was arrested along**\n[along with dozens of his customers in a global law enforcement sweep in 2014.](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/05/blackshades-trojan-users-had-it-coming/)\n\nIndeed, many former customers of LuminosityLink have posted to Hackforums that they are\nexpecting similar treatment:\n\n\n-----\n\nHackforums users speculate that Grubbs’ arrest could lead to the arrest and prosecution of his\n\ncustomers. Image: Palo Alto Networks.\n\nGrubbs initially pleaded not guilty, and his trial was slated to begin in August. But in a plea\nagreement released today, Grubbs admitted to conspiring to make and sell LuminosityLink,\nand to knowingly assisting customers in using his software to break into computers.\n\nThe plea agreement notes that on July 10, 2017, when Grubbs found out the FBI was about\nto raid his apartment, he hid the phone and debit card tied to his Bitcoin account, and also\nremoved the hard drives from his computer and apartment prior to the search. “Three days\nlater, Defendant transferred over 114 bitcoin from his LuminosityLink bitcoin address into six\nnew bitcoin addresses,” the agreement states.\n\nThe charges to which Grubbs has pleaded guilty carry punishments of up to 25 years in\nprison and as much as $750,000 in fines, although any sentence the judge hands down in\nthis case may be significantly tempered by U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n[A copy of the plea agreement is available here (PDF).](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018.07.16.Plea-Agreement.pdf)\n\n\n-----",
