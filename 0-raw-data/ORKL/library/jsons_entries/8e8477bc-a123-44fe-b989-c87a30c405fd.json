Our analysis of the decompiled SUNBURST code\nand passive DNS data show that that receiving a “NetBios” response does not necessarily\nmean that the client has been targeted. Unfortunately this misunderstanding has lead to\nvarious sensationalist stories being published with long lists of companies and organizations\nthat are claimed to be “singled out by the hacking group for the second stage of the attack”,\n“explicitly selected by the SolarWinds hackers for further activities” or “breached via\nSolarWinds and then specifically targeted by the hackers for additional internal compromise”.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother common misunderstanding is that clients sending .avsvmcloud.com DNS queries\nwith encoded timestamps, and optionally a list of installed/running AV products, have been\nactively targeted. Our analysis of the decompiled SUNBURST code show that the\n[timestamped “Pings” or AV service status reports get exfiltrated in DNS traffic after the](https://netresec.com/?b=20C1c3b)\nclient’s internal AD domain has been sent, but before the perpetrators decide whether or not\nthey want to activate the backdoor.\n\n**Indicators of a Targeted Attack**\n\nSo what network based IOC’s can incident responders, blue teams and SOC analysts use in\norder to see if they have been targeted by the SUNBURST operators?\n\nThe following network based events indicate that a client has been actively targeted and the\nSUNBURST backdoor has progressed beyond the initial mode of operation:\n\nReceived a DNS A record for an *.avsvmcloud.com query, that points to an IP address\nin any of the following three networks: 18.130.0.0/16, 99.79.0.0/16 or 184.72.0.0/15\n[Sent an *.avsvmcloud.com DNS query with the STAGE2 flag encoded in the](https://netresec.com/?b=2113a6a)\nsubdomain.\nReceived a CNAME record for a query to *.avsvmcloud.com\n\nThese three indicators are DNS based, so organizations will need to have a full historical\nbacklog of DNS transactions ranging back to April 2020 in order to use them reliably.\nAnother network based IOC is HTTPS communication to one of the known STAGE3 C2\ndomains. However, please note that the C2 domain list might not be complete. It is even\npossible that a unique C2 domain is used for each victim. Nevertheless, here’s a list of the\nSUNBURST STAGE3 C2 domains we are currently aware of:\n\navsvmcloud[.]com\ndatabasegalore[.]com\ndeftsecurity[.]com\ndigitalcollege[.]org\nfreescanonline[.]com\nglobalnetworkissues[.]com\nhighdatabase[.]com\nincomeupdate[.]com\nkubecloud[.]com\nlcomputers[.]com\nmobilnweb[.]com\npanhardware[.]com\nseobundlekit[.]com\nsolartrackingsystem[.]net\nthedoccloud[.]com\nvirtualwebdata[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nwebcodez[.]com\nwebsitetheme[.]com\nzupertech[.]com\n\n**Palo Alto was a Targeted SUNBURST Victim**\n\nWe can now verify that Palo Alto was among the targeted SUNBURST victims, because their\nDNS request for \"5qbtj04rcbp3tiq8bo6t.appsync.api.us.east.1.avsvmcloud.com\" contains an\n[encoded STAGE2 flag. The attack took place on September 29 at around 04:00 UTC,](https://netresec.com/?b=2113a6a)\naccording to the timestamp that was also encoded into the avsvmcloud subdomain.\n\n_Image: Parsing_ _[passive DNS data from Dancho Danchev with](https://ddanchev.blogspot.com/2020/12/exposing-solarwinds-malware-campaign.html)_ _[SunburstDomainDecoder v1.9](https://netresec.com/?b=20C0f71)_\n_and filtering on GUID “22334A7227544B1E”._\n\n[Palo Alto's CEO Nikesh Arora has confirmed that they were hit by SUNBURST (or](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2020/12/solarwinds-statement-solarstorm)\n\"SolarStorm\" as they call it), but they don’t provide much details. Here’s what Nikesh wrote\non December 17:\n\nRecently, we experienced an attempt to download Cobalt Strike on one of our IT\nSolarWinds servers. [...]\n\nWe thought this was an isolated incident, however, on Dec. 13, we became aware that\nthe SolarWinds software supply chain was compromised and it became clear that the\nincident we prevented was an attempted SolarStorm attack.\n\nOur [SUNBURST STAGE2 Victim Table has now been updated to include Palo Alto along](https://netresec.com/?b=2113a6a)\nside the other targeted victims.\n\nPosted by Erik Hjelmvik on Monday, 11 January 2021 10:30:00 (UTC/GMT)\n\n[Tags: #SUNBURST #SolarWinds #SolarStorm #avsvmcloud #STAGE2 #DNS #CNAME](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&tag=SUNBURST)\n[#avsvmcloud.com #Cobalt Strike #DNS #FireEye](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&tag=avsvmcloud.com)\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n» [Real-time PCAP-over-IP in Wireshark](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2022-05&post=Real-time-PCAP-over-IP-in-Wireshark)\n\n» [Emotet C2 and Spam Traffic Video](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2022-05&post=Emotet-C2-and-Spam-Traffic-Video)\n\n\n-----\n\n» [Industroyer2 IEC-104 Analysis](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2022-04&post=Industroyer2-IEC-104-Analysis)\n\n» [NetworkMiner 2.7.3 Released](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2022-04&post=NetworkMiner-2-7-3-Released)\n\n» [PolarProxy in Windows Sandbox](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2022-01&post=PolarProxy-in-Windows-Sandbox)\n\n» [PolarProxy 0.9 Released](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2022-01&post=PolarProxy-0-9-Released)\n\n## Blog Archive\n\n» [2022 Blog Posts](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2022)\n\n» [2021 Blog Posts](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2021)\n\n» [2020 Blog Posts](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2020)\n\n» [2019 Blog Posts](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2019)\n\n» [2018 Blog Posts](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2018)\n\n» [2017 Blog Posts](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2017)\n\n» [2016 Blog Posts](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2016)\n\n» [2015 Blog Posts](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2015)\n\n» [2014 Blog Posts](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2014)\n\n» [2013 Blog Posts](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2013)\n\n» [2012 Blog Posts](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2012)\n\n» [2011 Blog Posts](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2011)\n\n[List all blog posts](https://netresec.com/?page=Blog&blogPostList=true)\n\n## NETRESEC on Twitter\n\nFollow [@netresec on twitter:](http://twitter.com/netresec)\n\n» [twitter.com/netresec](http://twitter.com/netresec)\n\n\n-----",
