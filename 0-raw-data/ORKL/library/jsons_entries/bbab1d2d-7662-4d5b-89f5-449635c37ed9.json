This advisory provides a\ntimeline of activity observed, from initial access to execution of encryption and wiper attacks.\nAdditional information concerning files used by the actors during their exploitation of and cyber attack\nagainst the victim organization is provided in Appendices A and B.\n\nIn July 2022, Iranian state cyber actors—identifying as “HomeLand Justice”—launched a destructive\ncyber attack against the Government of Albania which rendered websites and services unavailable. A\nFBI investigation indicates Iranian state cyber actors acquired initial access to the victim’s network\napproximately 14 months before launching the destructive cyber attack, which included a\nransomware-style file encryptor and disk wiping malware. The actors maintained continuous network\naccess for approximately a year, periodically accessing and exfiltrating e-mail content.\n\nBetween May and June 2022, Iranian state cyber actors conducted lateral movements, network\nreconnaissance, and credential harvesting from Albanian government networks. In July 2022, the\nactors launched ransomware on the networks, leaving an anti-Mujahideen E-Khalq (MEK) message\non desktops. When network defenders identified and began to respond to the ransomware activity,\nthe cyber actors deployed a version of ZeroCleare destructive malware.\n\nIn June 2022, HomeLand Justice created a website and multiple social media profiles posting antiMEK messages. On July 18, 2022, HomeLand Justice claimed credit for the cyber attack on Albanian\ngovernment infrastructure. On July 23, 2022, Homeland Justice posted videos of the cyber attack on\ntheir website. From late July to mid-August 2022, social media accounts associated with HomeLand\n\n_All organizations should report incidents and anomalous activity to CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at_\n_[report@cisa.gov](mailto:report@cisa.gov)_ _or (888) 282-0870 and/or to the FBI via your local FBI field.

These followed\nclosely after actions by Albania to publicly attribute the July cyber attacks and to severe diplomatic\nties with Iran.\n\n### TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n#### Initial access\n\n**Timeframe: Approximately 14 months before encryption and wiper attacks.**\n\n**Details: Initial access was obtained via exploitation of an Internet-facing Microsoft SharePoint,**\nexploiting CVE-2019-0604.\n\n#### Persistence and Lateral movement\n\n**Timeframe: Approximately several days to two months after initial compromise.**\n\n**Details: After obtaining access to the victim environment, the actors used several .aspx webshells,**\n```\n   pickers.aspx, error4.aspx, ClientBin.aspx, to maintain persistence. During this\n\n```\ntimeframe, the actors also used RDP (primarily), SMB, and FTP for lateral movement throughout the\nvictim environment.\n\n#### Exchange Server compromise\n\n**Timeframe: Approximately 1-6 months after initial compromise.**\n\n**Details: The actors used a compromised Microsoft Exchange account to run searches (via CmdLets**\nNew-MailboxSearch and Get-Recipient) on various mailboxes, including for administrator accounts. In\nthis timeframe, the actors used the compromised account to create a new Exchange account and add\nit to the Organization Management role group.\n\n#### Likely Email exfiltration\n\n**Timeframe: Approximately 8 months after initial compromise.**\n\n**Details: The actors made thousands of HTTP POST requests to Exchange servers of the victim**\norganization. The FBI observed the client transferring roughly 70-160 MB of data, and the server\ntransferring roughly 3-20 GB of data.\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n#### VPN activity\n\n**Timeframe: Approximately 12-14 months after initial compromise.**\n\n**Details: Approximately twelve months after initial access and two months before launching the**\ndestructive cyber attack, the actors made connections to IP addresses belonging to the victim\norganization’s Virtual Private Network (VPN) appliance. The actors’ activity primarily involved two\ncompromised accounts. The actors executed the “Advanced Port Scanner”\n(advanced_port_scanner.exe). The FBI also found evidence of Mimikatz usage and LSASS dumping.\n\n#### File Cryptor (ransomware-style file encryptor)\n\n**Timeframe: Approximately 14 months after initial compromise.**\n\n**Details: For the encryption component of the cyber attack, the actor logged in to a victim organization**\nprint server via RDP and kicked off a process (Mellona.exe) which would propagate the GoXml.exe\nencryptor to a list of internal machines, along with a persistence script called win.bat. As deployed,\nGoXML.exe encrypted all files (except those having extensions .exe, .dll, .sys, .lnk, or .lck) on the\ntarget system, leaving behind a ransom note titled How_To_Unlock_MyFiles.txt in each folder\nimpacted.\n\n#### Wiper attack\n\n**Timeframe: Approximately 14 months after initial compromise.**\n\n**Details: In the same timeframe as the encryption attack, the actors began actions that resulted in raw**\ndisk drives being wiped with the Disk Wiper tool (cl.exe) described in Appendix A. Approximately over\nthe next eight hours, numerous RDP connections were logged from an identified victim server to other\nhosts on the victim’s network. Command line execution of cl.exe was observed in cached bitmap files\nfrom these RDP sessions on the victim server.\n\n### MITIGATIONS\n\n     - Ensure anti-virus and anti-malware software is enabled and signature definitions are updated\nregularly and in a timely manner. Well-maintained anti-virus software may prevent use of\ncommonly deployed cyber attacker tools that are delivered via spear-phishing.\n\n     - Adopt threat reputation services at the network device, operating system, application, and\nemail service levels. Reputation services can be used to detect or prevent low-reputation\nemail addresses, files, URLs, and IP addresses used in spear-phishing attacks.\n\n     - If your organization is employing certain types of software and appliances vulnerable to known\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), ensure those vulnerabilities are patched.\n[Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities.](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n     - Monitor for unusually large amounts of data (i.e. several GB) being transferred from a\nMicrosoft Exchange server.\n\n     - Check the host-based indications, including webshells, for positive hits within your\nenvironment.\n\nAdditionally, FBI and CISA recommend organizations apply the following best practices to reduce risk\nof compromise:\n\n     - **Maintain and test an incident response plan.**\n\n     - **Ensure your organization has a vulnerability management program in place and that it**\n[prioritizes patch management and vulnerability scanning of known exploited vulnerabilities.](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\n**[Note: CISA’s Cyber Hygiene Services (CyHy) are free to all state, local, tribal, and territorial](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services)**\n(SLTT) organizations, as well as public and private sector critical infrastructure organizations.\n\n     - **Properly configure and secure internet-facing network devices.**\n```\n        o Do not expose management interfaces to the internet.\n        o Disable unused or unnecessary network ports and protocols.\n        o Disable/remove unused network services and devices.\n\n```\n     - **[Adopt zero-trust principles and architecture, including:](https://www.cisa.gov/blog/2021/09/07/no-trust-no-problem-maturing-towards-zero-trust-architectures)**\n```\n        o Micro-segmenting networks and functions to limit or block lateral movements.\n        o Enforcing phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users and VPN\n\n```\nconnections.\n```\n        o Restricting access to trusted devices and users on the networks.\n\n```\nFor more information on Iranian government-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA's webpage\n[– Iran Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories.](https://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/iran)\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n\n-----\n\n0\n\n**TLP:WHITE** Product ID: AA22-264A\nSeptember 21, 2022\n\n## Appendix A[1]\n\n**Host-based IOCs**\n\n**File** **MD5 Hash** **Notes**\n\n`Error4.aspx` `81e123351eb80e605ad73268a5653ff3` Webshell\n\n`cl.exe` `7b71764236f244ae971742ee1bc6b098` Wiper\n\n`GoXML.exe` `bbe983dba3bf319621b447618548b740` Encryptor\n```\n Goxml.jpg 0738242a521bdfe1f3ecc173f1726aa1\n\n```\n`ClientBin.aspx` `a9fa6cfdba41c57d8094545e9b56db36` [Webshell (reverse-]\n\nproxy connections)\n\n`Pickers.aspx` `8f766dea3afd410ebcd5df5994a3c571` Webshell\n\n`evaluatesiteupgrade.cs.aspx` Unknown Webshell\n\n`mellona.exe` `78562ba0069d4235f28efd01e3f32a82` [Propagation for ]\n\nEncryptor\n\nLaunches\n\n`win.bat` GoXml.exe on\n\n`1635e1acd72809479e21b0ac5497a79b` startup\n\nChanges desktop\n\n`win.bat` background to\n\n`18e01dee14167c1cf8a58b6a648ee049` encryption image\n\n1 Additional details concerning some of these files are provided in Appendix B.\n\n_All organizations should report incidents and anomalous activity to CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at_\n_[report@cisa.gov](mailto:report@cisa.gov)_ _or (888) 282-0870 and/or to the FBI via your local FBI field.

disk wiper utility that provides raw access to the hard\ndrive for the purposes of wiping data. From the command line the cl.exe file accepts the arguments:\n```\n    • in\n    • un\n    • wp <optional argument>\n\n```\nIf executed with the in command, the utility will output in start! and installs a hard coded file\nnamed rwdsk.sys as a service named RawDisk3. The .SYS file is not extracted from the installer\nhowever, but rather the installer looks for the file in the same directory that the cl.exe is executed in.\n\n|goxml.jpg|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|File Size:|1.2 MB (1259040 bytes)|\n|SHA256:|63dd02c371e84323c4fd9a161a75e0f525423219e8a6ec1b95dd9eda182af2c9|\n|SHA1:|683eaec2b3bb5436f00b2172e287dc95e2ff2266|\n|MD5:|0738242a521bdfe1f3ecc173f1726aa1|\n|SSDeep:|12288:ME0p1RE70zxntT/ylTyaaSMn2fS+0M6puxKfJbDKrCxMe5fPSC2tmx VjpJT/n37p:MHyUt7yQaaPXS6pjar+MwrjpJ7VIbZg (Ver 1.1)|\n|File Type:|JPEG image data, Exif standard: [TIFF image data, big-endian, direntries=13, height=1752, bps=0, PhotometricIntepretation=CMYK, orientation=upper-left, width=2484TIFF image data, big-endian, direntries=13, height=1752, bps=0, PhotometricIntepretation=CMYK, orientation=upper-left, width=2484], progressive, precision 8, 2484x1752, components 4|\n|Software:|Adobe Photoshop 22.4 (Windows)|\n|Modify Date:|2022-07-13 20:45:20|\n|Create Date:|2020-06-11 02:13:33|\n|Metadata Date:|2022-07-13 20:45:20|\n|Profile Date Time:|2000-07-26 05:41:53|\n|Image Size:|2484x1752|\n|File Size:|1.2 MB (1259040 bytes)|\n|SHA256:|63dd02c371e84323c4fd9a161a75e0f525423219e8a6ec1b95dd9eda182af2c9|\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n_It will also load the driver after installation._\n\nThe un command uninstalls the service, outputting the message “un start!” to the terminal.\n\nThe wp command will access the loaded driver for raw disk access.\n\n_Raw Disk Access_\n\nThe long hexadecimal string is hard coded in the cl.exe binary.\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n```\n   RawDisk3File = (void *)toOpenRawDisk3File(\n                arg2_WideCharStr,\n                0xC0000000,\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n```\nL\"B4B615C28CCD059CF8ED1ABF1C71FE03C0354522990AF63ADF3C911E2287A4B906D47D\");\n   ptrRawDiskFile = RawDisk3File;\n   if ( RawDisk3File )\n   {\n    sizeDisk = toGetDiskSize(RawDisk3File);\n    terminal_out(\"Total Bytez : %lld\\n\", sizeDisk << 9);\n\n```\n\nThe wp command also takes an additional argument as a device path to place after \\RawDisk3\\ in\nthe output string.
