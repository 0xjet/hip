The outlooks posited appear to be getting progressively\nhawkish as both the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and U.S. officials refuse to back\ndown from their confrontational stances, which could be a long stand-off as the first Hague\ntribunal deciding if China’s nine-dash line is consistent with the UN Convention on the Law\nof the Sea (UNCLOS) does not start until July 2015. But among the slew of U.S.-Sino\nrelations’ experts dissecting every policy move, one modern yardstick of escalation seems\nto be mysteriously absent from the conversation: cyber reconnaissance.\n\nHow quickly everyone seems to forget – just weeks ago, cyber security was one of the\nforemost topics in the media. Now the attention has turned to naval strategy and political\nposturing, ignoring the fact that, for developed world powers, military doctrine is now\ninextricably linked with cyber capabilities. The world has previously witnessed the role joint\ncyber/kinetic warfare played in the 2008 Russo-Georgian conflict and more recently in the\nRussian-Ukrainian conflict, where cyber served as a means for kinetic disruption,\n\n\n-----\n\ndissemination of disinformation, and political subversion. It would be a mistake to think that\nthe PRC was not taking notes on the lessons learned through these modern conflicts.\nAccording to sensitive source reporting, there have been several People’s Liberation Army\n(PLA) papers discussing such tactics and their effectiveness.\n\nIndeed the PRC has already recently used cyber reconnaissance as a precursor to other\ndiplomatically sensitive strategic moves in the SCS. This includes the mid-2014 GOBLIN\nPANDA activity against the Vietnamese government during the HYSY-981 oilrig\nstandoff. Around the same time, the PRC’s efforts to quietly quell the Umbrella Revolution in\nHong Kong bore fingerprints and tradecraft attributed to multiple PANDA groups, suggesting\nBeijing called several known groups off of their normal targeting to address an issue of\nimportance to the PRC government. Why should the present conflict be any different?\n\nPRC-based actors such as PIRATE PANDA and LOTUS PANDA have already been\nobserved increasing their SCS-related targeting over the past 4-6 weeks, mostly against the\nPhilippine military. Reconnaissance and spear-phishing activity targeting U.S. and\nAustralian military/defense forces would signify a broader, more aggressive change to\nChina’s strategy for enforcing its recent controversial SCS Air Defense Identification Zone\n(ADIZ) claims. No activity of this type has yet been observed, though given the fluidity of\nevents over the past week, this is likely to change in the near future. Though China-based\nactors have typically not demonstrated stealthy tradecraft against Western targets, the\npublic disclosures over the past couple years and the stakes of the present conflict may\ninspire slightly more awareness when targeting more advanced Western military systems.\n\nOut of the adversaries recently observed as active in SCS-related targeting, GOBLIN\nPANDA’s absence is particularly noteworthy given that Vietnam is the other major claimant\nto the Spratly Islands, where the controversial island construction is taking place. As\nPIRATE and LOTUS PANDA have not been overly discreet about their recent targeting, it\nstands to reason that GOBLIN PANDA would not have improved its capabilities enough in\nsuch a short time to be completely invisible, which suggests that GOBLIN PANDA may have\neither changed tactics or has some other immediate focus at present time.\n\nAnother measure of conflict escalation via cyber means would include increased activity\nfrom China’s patriotic hacker corps. These groups have typically made up the third, less\nsophisticated, prong of PRC cyber forces, along with specialized military units and civilian\nagencies like the Ministry of State Security (MSS) and Ministry of Public Security (MPS). As\npart of PRC militarized posturing, domestic services helping to control and regulate China’s\nnationalistic hackers, such as the MPS, generally relax their monitoring during times of\nconflict. This was first observed during the brief U.S.-China hacker war after the Hainan\nIsland incident in 2001, when China’s patriotic hacker movement was at its peak. It occurred\nagain in 2014 when the GOBLIN PANDA activity was actually preceded by attacks and\ndefacements of Vietnamese government websites by the nationalistic 1937cn Team prior to\nbeing reigned in after their involvement in the incident was made public.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile it is always possible a severe miscalculation or military incident can cause the current\nsituation to erupt into violent conflict, both the U.S. and China have stated that they seek a\npeaceful way to resolve the dispute. Both countries have measured responses for avoiding\nmilitary conflict and will likely utilize them fully. Watching for changes to the cyber landscape\nin the SCS still presents one of the best indications of intent, as it has become a reliable\nprecursor to armed conflict, which now depends on gaining complete information advantage\nover the adversary. Stay vigilant, friends.\n\nRelated Content\n\nWho is EMBER BEAR?\n\n\n-----\n\nA Tale of Two Cookies: How to Pwn2Own the Cisco RV340 Router\n\n\n-----\n\nPROPHET SPIDER Exploits Citrix ShareFile Remote Code Execution Vulnerability CVE 2021 22941 to\nDeliver Webshell\n\n\n-----",
