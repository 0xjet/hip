CTU™ analysis indicates that the group is returning\nto the levels of activity that represented a peak in 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Conti leak site listed an average of 43 victims per month in 2021. Despite a drop\n[following the Colonial Pipeline attack and a peak of 95 victims listed in November, the rate of](https://www.colpipe.com/news/press-releases/media-statement-colonial-pipeline-system-disruption)\nnaming victims was fairly consistent. The decreased activity in December 2021 and January\n2022 across all name-and-shame ransomware groups was likely due to a holiday break. The\nnumber of victims added to the Conti leak site increased in February 2022. On February 27,\n[the @ContiLeaks Twitter persona began leaking GOLD ULRICK data and communications.](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/gold-ulrick-leaks-reveal-organizational-structure-and-relationships)\nDespite these public disclosures, the number of Conti victims posted in March surged to the\nsecond-highest monthly total since January 2021 (see Figure 1).\n\n_Figure 1. Number of new victims added to the Conti leak site per month between January_\n_2021 and March 2022. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nAlthough these types of leaks could have prompted some threat groups to modify their\ncommunication methods or tooling, GOLD ULRICK appears to have continued and even\nincreased the tempo of its operations without disruption. GOLD ULRICK member 'Jordan\nConti' confirmed this continuation and the minimal impact of the disclosures in a March 31,\n2022 post on the RAMP underground forum (see Figure 2). CTU researchers previously\nobserved this persona advertising Conti, providing updates on takedown efforts, and\nrecruiting affiliates.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. RAMP forum post by a GOLD ULRICK member (translated from Russian). (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\nThe March 31 post claims that the Conti leak site only lists victims that have not paid the\nransom and that twice that number have been compromised. It suggests that Conti has a\n50% payment success rate with an average payout of '700k'. The currency is not specified\nbut is likely to be U.S. dollars. CTU researchers are unable to verify these claims, but it is\nreasonable to assume that the leak site does not list all victims.\n\n'Jordan Conti' indicates that GOLD ULRICK continues to evolve its ransomware, intrusion\nmethods, and approaches to working with data. The Conti leak site added 11 victims in the\nfirst four days of April. If GOLD ULRICK operations continue at that pace, the group will\ncontinue to pose one of the most significant cybercrime threats to organizations globally.\n\nTo learn more about how ransomware groups adapt, read our Ransomware\n[Evolution analysis and watch our Ransomware Trends: The Evolution of Threat webinar.](https://www.secureworks.com/resources/wc-ransomware-trends-the-evolution-of-threat)\n\nIf you need urgent assistance with an incident, contact the Secureworks Incident Response\nteam.\n\n\n-----",
