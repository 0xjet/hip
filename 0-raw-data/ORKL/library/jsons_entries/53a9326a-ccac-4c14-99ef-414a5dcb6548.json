This is the summary of an analysis by an IT\nsecurity researcher, which we publish in full. The in-depth report provides an analysis of\ntechnology, impact, possible attribution – and a signature to detect the malware.\n\n_[This analysis of security researcher Claudio Guarnieri was originally written for The Left in](https://nex.sx/)_\n_German Bundestag. We’re publishing it here with permission from The Left._\n\n_[Von diesem Bericht existiert auch eine deutsche Übersetzung.](https://netzpolitik.org/2015/digitaler-angriff-auf-den-bundestag-investigativer-bericht-zum-hack-der-it-infrastruktur-der-linksfraktion/)_\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\nTwo suspicious artifacts have been retrieved from two separate servers within the Die Linke\ninfrastructure. One is an open source utility used to remotely issue commands on a Windows\nhost from a Linux host. The other is a custom utility which, despite its large size, has limited\nfunctionality and acts as a tunnel, possibly used by the attackers to maintain persistence\nwithin the compromised network.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe combination of the two utilities seems to be enough for the attackers to maintain a\nfoothold inside the network, harvest data, and exfiltrate all the information they deemed\ninteresting. It is, however, possible that there are additional malicious artifacts which have\nnot yet been discovered.\n\nAttributes of one of the artifacts and intelligence gathered on the infrastructure operated by\nthe attackers suggest that the attack was perpetrated by a state-sponsored group known as\n**Sofacy (or APT28). Previous work published by security vendor FireEye in October 2014**\nsuggests the group might be of Russian origin.\n\n## Artifacts\n\nThe first artifact – identified across this report as Artifact #1 – has the following attributes:\n\n**Name** winexesvc.exe\n\n**Size** 23552\n\n**MD5** 77e7fb6b56c3ece4ef4e93b6dc608be0\n\n**SHA1** f46f84e53263a33e266aae520cb2c1bd0a73354e\n\n**SHA256** 5130f600cd9a9cdc82d4bad938b20cbd2f699aadb76e7f3f1a93602330d9997d\n\nThe second artifact – identified across this report as Artifact #2 – -has the following\nattributes:\n\n**Name** svchost.exe.exe\n\n**Size** 1062912\n\n**MD5** 5e70a5c47c6b59dae7faf0f2d62b28b3\n\n**SHA1** cdeea936331fcdd8158c876e9d23539f8976c305\n\n**SHA256** 730a0e3daf0b54f065bdd2ca427fbe10e8d4e28646a5dc40cbcfb15e1702ed9a\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Time**\n\n\n2015-04-22 10:49:54\n\n\n## Analysis of Artifact #1\n\nArtifact #1 was retrieved from a File Server operated by Die Linke. The file is a 64bit[compatible compiled binary of the open source utility Winexe. Winexe is software similar to](https://github.com/skalkoto/winexe/)\nthe more popular PSExec and is designed to allow system administrators to execute\ncommands on remote servers. While commercial solutions like Symantec pcAnywhere\n\n\n-----\n\nprovide a larger feature-set, Winexe is lightweight, and doesn t require any installation or\nconfiguration. One of the reasons Winexe is preferred over PSExec, is that it provides a\nLinux client, while PSExec doesn’t.\n\nAttackers are making growing use of utilities like Winexe and PSExec to perform lateral\nmovement across compromised networks. Besides providing the ability to execute arbitrary\ncommands on the target system, these utilities normally don’t raise suspicion as they are\ncommonly whitelisted by Antivirus and other commercial security software.\n\nWinexe acts as a Windows service that can be configured to automatically start at boot and\nsilently wait for incoming commands over a named pipe. Named pipes are a Windows interprocess communication method. Through named pipes, processes are able to communicate\nand exchange data even over a network. In the case of Artifact #1, the name of the pipe is\n„ahexec“, computers over the network could access the pipe server by simply opening a file\nhandle on „\\ServerNamepipeahexec“.\n\nOnce connected to the pipe, a user or a program can easily provide information required to\nexecute command (just as they would normally through a command-line). The provided\ninformation is then passed to a „CreateProcessAsUserA“ call and the specified command is\nexecuted.\n\nOnce inside the network, Artifact #1 can be enough for the attacker to download or create\nadditional scripts, execute commands and exfiltrate data (for example, simply through ftp). It\nis plausible that Artifact #1 could be present on other servers under different names,\nalthough it is also likely that the attacker only left it on servers to which they required\nmaintainenance of persistent access.\n\nIt is important that all the deployments of this utility are identified and removed, as they are\nself-sufficient and they provide easy and open access to execute commands on the host,\npotentially with administrator privileges.\n\n## Analysis of Artifact #2\n\nArtifact #2 was recovered from the Admin Controller operated by Die Linke. This is custom\nmalware, which despite large file size (1,1 MB), provides limited functionality. Artifact #2\noperates as a backchannel for the attacker to maintain a foothold inside the compromised\nnetwork. The properties of the artifact show that the same authors of the malware seem to\nhave called it „Xtunnel“. As the same name suggests, the artifact appears in fact to act as a\ntunnel for the attacker to remotely access the internal network and maintain persistence.\n\nThe artifact is dependent on a working network connection in order to function properly. In\ncase connectivity can’t be established, the process will lock in an endless loop as shown in\nthe behavioral schema below:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter initialization, the artifact will attempt to\nestablish a connection by creating a socket. In case\nof failure, it will sleep for three seconds and try\nagain. The authors of the malware didn’t appear to\nhave spent any effort in concealing indicators or\nobfuscating code – the IP address with which it tries\nto communicate is hardcoded in clear-text inside the\nbinary. We can observe below, the procedure\nthrough which the artifact attempts to establish a\nconnection with the IP address „176.31.112.10“:\n\nThis specific IP address is a critical piece of\ninformation that enables us to connect this attack to\na spree of previous targeted campaigns. The details\nof this attribution is explained in a dedicated section\nbelow. We will refer to this IP address as „Command\n& Control“ (or „C&C“).\n\nThe artifact is able of receiving multiple arguments, including -Si, -Sp, -Up, -Pp, -Pi and SSL. Following are the beaconing packets the artifact will send to Command & Control:\n\n-Si\n\n00000000 2a 00 00 00 *…\n\n00000004 b2 23 16 85 ee 59 52 a6 79 3a 2a e2 da 11 c0 1b .#…YR. y:*…..\n\n00000014 de 77 ea 47 35 11 de 8a 76 1a ee 16 d9 fd 28 0d .w.G5… v…..(.\n\n-Sp\n\n00000000 22 00 00 00 „…\n\n00000004 90 ac c6 39 09 b6 23 72 9d 36 a6 3b 2e b7 02 ce …9..#r .6.;….\n\n\n-----\n\n00000014 dd 09 d4 e4 d3 e6 01 5f 6a 37 b2 39 01 b4 0a af ……._ j7.9….\n\n-Up\n\n00000000 07 00 00 00 ….\n\n00000004 7e e2 82 05 74 be 3f 9b 8e 6a dc 5c d1 fe 85 f7 ~…t.?. .j…..\n\n00000014 5f 33 26 6e 5e 62 c1 0e c0 da a3 b3 6c f9 ca 88 _3&n^b.. ….l…\n\nIf the argument -SSL is given through command-line to the artifact, these beacons will be\nencapsulated in an SSL connection and a proper TLS handshake will be initiated with the\nC&C.\n\nInterestingly, the artifact bundles a copy of OpenSSL 1.0.1e, from February 2013, which\ncauses the unusually large size of the binary. More importantly, the Command & Control\nserver (176.31.112.10) also appears to be using an outdated version of OpenSSL and be\n[vulnerable to Heartbleed attacks. While unlikely, it is worth considering that the same C&C](http://www.zoomeye.org/lab/heartbleed/2015?port=&code=FR&p=6)\nserver might have been the subject of 3rd-party attacks due to this vulnerability.\n\nIf connections to the C&C are blocked or terminated through a firewall, the artifact will be\ninhibited, as it doesn’t seem to have any fallback protocol. Additionally, since it does not\nexecute any other functionality autonomously, it would no longer be a direct threat.\n\nA [Yara signature to detect this artifact is provided in the Appendix.](https://plusvic.github.io/yara/)\n\n## Analysis of Impact\n\nDespite the simplicity of the tools collected from the compromise, the impact of the attack\nand the capabilities of the attackers are not to be underestimated. From a purely operational\npoint of view, the combination of a tunnel and a command execution utility are more than\nenough for an attacker with sufficient privileges to move across a network undisturbed.\n\nIt is worth noting that Artifact #2 was compiled by the authors on „April 22nd“ 2015, which\nsuggests that the compromise may only have lasted a couple of weeks. As the attackers\nappear largely unconcerned with hiding their tracks or maintaining long-term persistence\naccess (for example, they didn’t appear to have attempted to create additional network\nadministrator accounts), it is probable that the operation was intentionally planned to be\nexecuted quickly in order to opportunistically collect and exfiltrate as much data as possible.\n\nThis is further corroborated by a recovered batch file with the following content:\n```\nfor %%G in (.pdf, .xls, .xlsx, .doc, .docx) do (\n  forfiles /P F:[REDACTED] /m *%%G /s /d +01.05.2015 /c \"cmd /c copy @path\nC:ProgramData[REDACTED]d@file\" )\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThis script identifies all PDF and Office documents dated after „May 1st (specified in the\ndate format supported by Microsoft Windows in German language) and collects them in a\nfolder, supposedly ready to be exfiltrated. While inone of the recovered artifacts appears to\nprovide dedicated exfiltration functionality, the attacker may have uploaded the documents\nthrough a common utility like ftp. It is probable that a previous version of the script was used\nto collect and exfiltrate documents dated prior to May 1st 2015.\n\nDue to the nature of the attacker and their modus operandi (which we’ll describe in the\nAttribution section below), we can not exclude the possibility that additional, more\nsophisticated artifacts have been deployed and either remain currently unidentified, or were\nremoved upon discovery and public disclosure of the incident.\n\nThese considerations suggest that the compromise was perpetrated by an experienced\nattacker.\n\n## Attribution\n\nWhile attribution of malware attacks is rarely simple or conclusive, during the course of this\ninvestigation I uncovered evidence that suggests the attacker might be affiliated with the\nstate-sponsored group known as Sofacy Group (also known as APT28 or Operation Pawn\nStorm). Although we are unable to provide details in support of such attribution, previous\n[work by security vendor FireEye suggests the group might be of Russian origin, however no](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/pdfs/apt28.pdf)\nevidence allows to tie the attacks to governments of any particular country.\n\nSofacy is a group dedicated to the compromise of high-profile targets and the theft of\nconfidential information. They appear to have been active since 2006. They are believed to\nhave successfully attacked the Ministries of Internal and Foreign Affairs of several ex-Soviet\ncountries, as well as Eastern European governments and military institutions, and NATO and\nthe White House.\n\nSofacy is known for making extensive use of phishing attacks to lure targets into revealing\ntheir credentials via realistic reconstruction of internal systems, such as webmails, as\nemployed against the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs in the infamous attacks that\npreceded the Georgian invasion of 2008:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to make the phishing attempts more credible, Sofacy Group has made use of\n„typesquatting“, intentionally using spelling mistakes (for example, replacing letters „i“ with „l“\nand „g“ with „q“, or by adding punctuation) to register domains very similar to the original\nlegitimate ones:\n\nSource: [PWC.](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2014/10/phresh-phishing-against-government-defence-and-energy.html)\n\nWhile Sofacy is also known to use of custom exploit frameworks and spear-phishing attacks,\nit is possible in this case that they managed to obtain privileged credentials of network\nadministrators within the Bundestag through the use of a phishing attack, which then allowed\nthem to navigate through the network and gain access to more data. It is worth noting that\nshortly before the attack, security vendors reported the use of 0-day exploits in Flash Player\n[and Microsoft Windows by the same threat actor.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/04/probable_apt28_useo.html)\n\n**Shared Command & Control infrastructure**\n\nWhile the artifacts don’t appear to show attributes useful for attribution, the network\ninfrastructure used during the attack led instead to interesting results. During investigation of\nthe Command & Control server (with IP „176.31.112.10“ hardcoded in Artifact #2), we\nmanaged to identify some operational mistakes made by the attackers, allowing us to\nconnect the incident with attacks previously associated with the Sofacy Group.\n\nThe address, 176.31.112.10, is a dedicated server provided by the French OVH hosting\ncompany, but is apparently operated by an offshore secure hosting company called\n[CrookServers.com and seemingly located in Pakistan:](http://www.crookservers.com/support-information.php)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Company Address:**\nMUAnetworks\nU ashraf\nVillage Kakra Town\nMirpur AJK\nPakistan\n\nIt is common for attackers to make use of offshore hosting facilities which are less likely to\ncooperate with law enforcement on takedown requests or requests of disclosure of their\ncustomers‘ identity.\n\nCrookServers appears to have servers scattered in a number of datacenters and dedicated\nserver hosting providers around the world.\n\nBy researching historical data relevant to C&C 176.31.112.10, we discovered that on\nFebruary 16th 2015, the server was sharing an SSL certificate with another IP address\nallocated to CrookServers and also hosted at OVH: „213.251.187.145“.\n\n[The recovered shared SSL certificate, obtained by a public internet-wide scanning initiative,](http://www.scans.io/)\nat the time had the following attributes:\n\n**MD5** b84b66bcdecd4b4529014619ed649d76\n\n**SHA1** fef1725ad72e4ef0432f8cb0cb73bf7ead339a7c\n\n**Algorithm** sha1WithRSAEncryption\n\n**Self-Signed** No\n\n**Subject** **C: GB**\n**L: Salford**\n**ST: Greater Manchester**\n**CN: mail.mfa.gov.ua**\n**O: COMODO CA Limited**\n**all: C=GB/ST=Greater Manchester/L=Salford/O=COMODO CA**\nLimited/CN=mail.mfa.gov.ua\n\n**Serial** 16474505314457171426\n\n**Not before** 20140414083521Z\n\n**Not after** 20410830083521Z\n\nAs shown, the certificate uses „mail.mfa.gov.ua“ as a Common Name. This suggests that this\ncertificate might have been previously used for a similar attack against the Ukrainian Ministry\nof Foreign Affairs, or associated targets, although there is no documentation of such attack\navailable to the public.\n\n\n-----\n\nMore importantly, the IP address this certificate was\nshared with – 213.251.187.145 – was previously\nidentified as used by Sofacy Group for phishing\nattacks against Albanian government institutions by\nregistering the domain „qov.al“ (notice, the letter „q“\ninstead of „g“) and creating realistic subdomains to\nlure victims into visiting. The domain was active on\nthe IP 213.251.187.145 from July 2014 up until\nMarch 2015.\n\nThese attacks against Albanian government\ninstitutions by the Sofacy Group were documented\nand reported by consultancy corporate PwC in\nDecember 2014. It is worth noting that this server\nalso seems to be operated by CrookServers, since\namong other domains, 454-reverse.crookservers.net\nresolved to the same IP address.\n\n**Similar Artifacts and root9B report**\n\nWhile the evidence presented strongly suggests a connection with the Sofacy Group, the\nartifacts (in particular Artifact #2) are not publicly recognized to be part of the more traditional\narsenal of these attackers.\n\nNevertheless, on May 12th 2015 (a few weeks after the attack against Bundestag appears to\n[have started) the American security firm root9B released a report containing details on](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/root9b-uncovers-planned-sofacy-cyber-attack-targeting-several-international-and-domestic-financial-institutions-300081634.html)\nmalware samples very similar to Artifact #2. The report also includes a mention of the same\nIP address used as Command & Control server in the attack against Bundestag\n(176.31.112.10).\n\n[While the report appears to contain numerous inaccuracies, some of the indicators of](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/05/security-firm-redefines-apt-african-phishing-threat/)\ncompromises are legitimate and appear to be correctly attributed to Sofacy.\n\nFollowing are hashes for malware artifacts showing very similar attributes to Artifact #2:\n```\n566ab945f61be016bfd9e83cc1b64f783b9b8deb891e6d504d3442bc8281b092\n\n## Appendix – Detection Signatures\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule apt_sofacy_xtunnel\n{\n  meta:\n   author = \"Claudio Guarnieri\"\n  strings:\n   $xaps = \":\\PROJECT\\XAPS_\"\n   $variant11 = \"XAPS_OBJECTIVE.dll\"\n   $variant12 = \"start\"\n   $variant21 = \"User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3;\nWOW64; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0\"\n   $variant22 = \"is you live?\"\n   $mix1 = \"176.31.112.10\"\n   $mix2 = \"error in select, errno %d\"\n   $mix3 = \"no msg\"\n   $mix4 = \"is you live?\"\n   $mix5 = \"127.0.0.1\"\n   $mix6 = \"err %d\"\n   $mix7 = \"i`m wait\"\n   $mix8 = \"hello\"\n   $mix9 = \"OpenSSL 1.0.1e 11 Feb 2013\"\n   $mix10 = \"Xtunnel.exe\"\n  condition:\n   ((uint16(0) == 0x5A4D) or (uint16(0) == 0xCFD0)) and\n   (($xaps) or (all of ($variant1*)) or (all of ($variant2*))\nor (6 of ($mix*)))\n}\n\n```\n\n-----",
