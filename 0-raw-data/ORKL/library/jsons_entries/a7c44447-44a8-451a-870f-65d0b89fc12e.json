Clearly, organizing effective security\nrequires the use of security solutions that incorporate a broad range of technologies capable of preventing a cryptor program from landing on a\npotential victim’s computer or reacting quickly to stop an ongoing data encryption process and roll back any malicious changes. However, what\ncan be done if an infection does occur and important data has been encrypted? (Infection can occur on nodes that, for whatever reason, were\nnot protected by a security solution, or if the solution was disabled by an administrator.) In this case, the victim’s only hope is that the attackers\nmade some mistakes when implementing the cryptographic algorithm, or used a weak encryption algorithm.\n\n## A brief description\n\nThe cryptor dubbed Polyglot emerged in late August. According to the information available to us, it is distributed in spam emails that contain a\nlink to a malicious RAR archive. The archive contains the cryptor’s executable code.\n\nHere are some examples of the links used:\n\n_hXXp://bank-info.gq/downloads/reshenie_suda.rar_\n\n_hXXp://bank-info.gq/downloads/dogovor.rar_\n\nWhen the infected file is launched, nothing appears to happen. However, the cryptor copies itself under random names to a dozen or so\nplaces, writes itself to the autostart folder and to TaskScheduler. When the installation is complete, file encryption starts. The user’s files do not\nappear to change (their names remain the same), but the user is no longer able to open them.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen encryption is complete, the cryptor changes the desktop wallpaper, (interestingly, the wallpaper image is unique to each victim) and\ndisplays the ransom message.\n\n_The cryptor’s main window_\n\n_New desktop wallpaper with the “open key” block unique to each victim computer_\n\nThe user is offered the chance to decrypt several files for free.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The free trial decryption window_\n\nAfter this, the user is told to pay for file decryption in bitcoins. The cryptor contacts its C&C, which is located on the Tor network, for the ransom\nsum and the bitcoin address where it should be sent.\n\n_C&C communication window_\n\nFrom this moment on, the cryptor allows the user to check the ransom payment status on the C&C.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Ransom payment details_\n\nIf the ransom is not paid on time, the cryptor notifies the user that it’s no longer possible to decrypt their files, and that it is about to ‘self-delete’.\n\n_Last window displayed by Polyglot_\n\n## Imitating CTB-Locker\n\nInitially, this cryptor caught our attention because it mimics all the features of another widespread cryptor – CTB-Locker (TrojanRansom.Win32.Onion). The graphical interface window, language switch, the sequence of actions for requesting the encryption key, the\npayment page, the desktop wallpapers – all of them are very similar to those used by CTB-Locker. The visual design has been copied very\nclosely, while the messages in Polyglot’s windows have been copied word for word.\n\n**The main graphical interface windows:**\n\nPolyglot CTB-Locker\n\n\n-----\n\n**List of encrypted files:**\n\nPolyglot CTB-Locker\n\n**Window for the trial decryption of 5 random files:**\n\nPolyglot CTB-Locker\n\n**The private key request window:**\n\n\n-----\n\nPolyglot CTB-Locker\n\n**The desktop wallpapers:**\n\nPolyglot CTB-Locker\n\n**The ‘connection failed’ error message:**\n\nPolyglot CTB-Locker\n\n\n-----\n\n**Offline decryption instructions:**\n\nPolyglot CTB-Locker\n\nThe similarities do not stop there. Even the encryption algorithms used by the cybercriminals have clearly been chosen to imitate those used in\nCTB-Locker.\n\nPolyglot CTB-Locker\n\n\nAlgorithms used\nfor file encryption\n\nAlgorithms used\nwhile working with\nthe keys\n\nExtensions of\nencrypted files\n\n\nFile content is packed into a ZIP archive and\nthen encrypted with AES-256.\n\nECDH (elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman),\ncurve25519, SHA256.\n\n\nFile extensions are not changed. File extensions are changed, depending on version:\n\n– .ctbl\n\n– .ctb2\n\n– 7 random lower-case Latin symbols\n\n\nFile content is compressed with Zlib and then encrypted with AES256.\n\nECDH (elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman), curve25519, SHA256.\n\n\nDemo decryption 5 files are decrypted for free as a demo.

Their decryption keys are\nonly stored in the RAM memory while the process is running.\n\nC&C is in the Tor network, communication is via a Tor client\nintegrated into the Trojan, or (in some versions of CTB-Locker) via a\npublic tor2web service.\n\n\nTraffic protection /\nobfuscation\n\n\nBitwise NOT operation. AES encryption.\n\n\n-----\n\nat sa d, e s ou d ote t e o o g a deta ed a a ys s as e ea ed t at o yg ot as de e oped depe de t y o C oc e ; ot e\nwords, no shared code has been detected in the two Trojans (except the publicly available DLL code). Perhaps the creators of Polyglot wanted\nto disorient the victims and researchers, and created a near carbon copy of CTB-Locker from scratch to make it look like a CTB-Locker attack\nand that there was no hope of getting files decrypted for free.\n\n## C&C communication\n\nThe Trojan contacts the C&C server located on Tor via a public tor2web service, using the HTTP protocol.\n\nPrior to each of the below data requests, a POST request is sent with the just one parameter: “live=1”.\n\n**Request 1.**\n\nAt the start of operation, the Trojan reports the successful infection to the C&C. The following data is sent to the C&C:\n\n{\n“ip”:”xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx”,     //ip address of the infected computer\n\n“method”:”register”,     //action type. “register” = Trojan informs C&C of new infection\n\n“uid”:”xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx”,     //Infected computer’s ID\n\n“version”:”10f”,     //Trojan version contained in its body\n\n“info”:”Microsoft (build xxxx), 64-bit”,     //OS version on the infected computer\n\n“description”:” “,     //Always a whitespace (” “)\n\n“start_time”:”14740xxxxx”,     //Trojan’s start time\n\n“end_time”:”0″,     //Encryption finish time. 0 = no encryption has run yet\n\n“user_id”:”5″     //Number hardwired in the sample\n\n}\n\nThis data block is passed through a bitwise NOT operation, encoded into Base64 and sent to the C&C in a POST request.\n\n_Contents of the sent request_\n\nParameters of the POST request:\n\nsignature – CRC32 from the sent data\n\nver – Trojan version\n\ngcdata – data, with contents as described above.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Request 1 and the reply received from the C&C_\n\n**Request 2.**\n\nWhen the Trojan has finished encrypting the user’s data, it sends another request to the C&C. The content of the request is identical to that of\nrequest 1 except the field “end_time”, which now shows the time encryption was completed.\n\n**Request 3.**\n\nThis is sent to the C&C to request the bitcoin address for payment and the ransom sum to be paid.\n\n{\n“method”:”getbtcpay”\n“uid”:”xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx”\n}\n\nThe C&C replies to this request with the following data:\n\n{\n“code”:”0″,\n“text”:”OK”,\n“address”:”xxxxxxxx”,     //bitcoin address (may vary)\n“btc”:0.7,     //amount to be paid in BTC (may vary)\n“usd”:319.98     //amount to be paid in USD (may vary)\n}\n\n**Request 4.**\n\nThis is sent to request a file decryption key from the C&C.\n\n\n-----\n\n{\n“method”:”getkeys”,\n“key”:””,\n“uid”:”xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx”,\n“info”:\n\n[“DYqbX3m9u0Pk9bE9Rg2Co3empC2M/yrnqgNS3r0AT2vwCw8Zas08bd4BNiO3XuAqi6/5WQ0VBiUkRUToo+YFL/QtPkiRIQ/D9RyKhzpBHlNpf2hP\n}\n\n**Request 5.**\n\nThe Trojan reports that data decryption has been completed and states the number of decrypted files to the C&C.\n\n{\n“method”:”setend”,\n“uid”:”xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx”,\n“decrypted”:”1″\n}\n\n## Description of the encryption algorithm\n\nDuring our analysis of the malicious code, it became evident that the Trojan encrypts files in three stages, creating intermediate files:\n\nFirst, the original file is placed in a password-protected ZIP archive. The archive has the same name as the original file plus the\nextension “a19”;\nPolyglot encrypts the password-protected archive with the AES-256-ECB algorithm. The resulting file again uses the name of the original\nfile, but the extension is now changed to “ap19”;\nThe Trojan deletes the original file and the file with the extension “a19”. The extension of the resulting file is changed from “ap19” to that\nof the original file.\n\n_Flowchart of the search and file encryption actions performed by Polyglot_\n\nA separate AES key is generated for each file, and is nothing more than a ‘shared secret’ generated according to the Diffie-Hellman protocol\non an elliptic curve. However, first things first.\n\nBefore encrypting any files, the Trojan generates two random sequences, each 32 bytes long. The SHA256 digests of each sequence become\nthe private keys s_ec_priv_1 and s_ec_priv_2. Then, the Bernstein elliptic curve (Curve25519) is used to obtain public keys s_ec_pub_1 and\n**s_ec_pub_2 (respectively) from each private key.**\n\nThe Trojan creates the structure decryption_info and writes the following to it: a random sequence used as the basis for creating the key\n**s_ec_priv_1, the string machine_guid taken from the registry, and a few zero bytes.**\n\nstruct decryption_info\n{\nchar s_rand_str_1[32];\n\nchar machine_guid[36];\n\nchar zeroes[12];\n\n};\n\nUsing the private key s_ec_priv_2 and the cybercriminal’s public key mal_pub_key produces the shared secret mal_shared_secret =\nECDH(s_ec_priv_2, mal_pub_key). The structure decryption_info is encrypted with algorithm AES-256-ECB using a key that is the SHA256\ndigest of this secret. For convenience, we shall call the obtained 80 bytes of the encrypted structure encrypted_info.\n\nOnly when Polyglot obtains the encrypted_info value does it proceed to generate the session key AES for the file. Using the above method, a\nnew pair of keys is generated, f_priv_key and f_pub_key. Using f_priv_key and s_ec_pub_1 produces the shared secret f_shared_secret\n= ECDH(f priv key, s ec pub 1).\n\n\n-----\n\ne S 56 d gest o t s sec et be t e S ey t c t e e s e c ypted\n\nTo specify that the file has already been encrypted and that it’s possible to decrypt the file, the cybercriminals write the structure file_info to\nthe start of each encrypted file:\n\nstruct file_info\n{\nchar label[4] = {‘H’,’U’, ‘I ‘, 0x00};\nuint32_t label2 = 1;\nuint64_t archive_size;\nchar f_pub_key[32];\nchar s_ec_pub_1[32];\nchar s_ec_pub_2[32];\nchar encrypted_info[80];\n};\n\nThe elliptic curve, the Diffie-Hellman protocol, AES-256, a password-protected archive – it was almost flawless. But not quite, because the\ncreator of Polyglot made a few mistakes during implementation. This gave us the opportunity to help the victims and restore files that had been\nencrypted by Polyglot.\n\n## Mistakes made by the creators\n\nAs was mentioned earlier, all the created keys are based on a randomly generated array of characters. Therefore, the strength of the keys is\ndetermined by the generator’s strength. And we were surprised to see the implementation of this generator:\n\n_A graphical representation of the random sequence generation procedure_\n\nLet’s convert this function into pseudocode so it’s easier to follow:\n\n\n-----\n\nPlease note that when another random byte is selected, the entire result of the function rand() is not used, just the remainder of dividing the\nresult by 32. Only the cybercriminal knows why they decided to make the random string this much weaker – an exhaustive search of the entire\nset of the possible keys produced by such a pseudo-random number generator will only take a few minutes on a standard PC.\n\nTaking advantage of this mistake, we were able to calculate the AES key for an encrypted file. Although there was a password-protected\narchive below the layer of symmetric encryption, we already knew that the cybercriminal had made another mistake.\n\nLet’s look at how the archive key is generated:\n\nWe can see that the key length is only 4 bytes; moreover, these are specific bytes from the string MachineGuid, the unique ID assigned to the\ncomputer by the operating system. Furthermore, a slightly modified MachineGuid string is displayed in the requirements text displayed to the\nvictim; this means that if we know the positions in which the 4 characters of the ZIP archive password are located, we can easily unpack the\narchive.\n\n_The MachineGuid string displayed in the requirements screen_\n\n## Conclusion\n\n[Files that are encrypted by this cryptor can be decrypted using Kaspersky Lab’s free anti-cryptor utility RannohDecryptor Version 1.9.3.0.](https://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/disinfection/8547)\n\n**All Kaspersky Lab solutions detect this cryptor malware as:**\n\n**Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Polyglot**\n\n**PDM:Trojan.Win32.Generic**\n\n**MD5**\n\n**c8799816d792e0c35f2649fa565e4ecb – Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Polyglot.a**\n\n\n-----",
