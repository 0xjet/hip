They were just getting started. From\nthere Sandworm embarked on a years-long spree of wantonly destructive attacks: another\n[blackout attack on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in 2016, the](https://www.wired.com/story/crash-override-malware/) release of the NotPetya worm in\n2017 that spread globally from Ukraine to cause $10 billion in damage, and a cyberattack\nthat temporarily destroyed the IT backend of the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea,\namong others.\n\nYet in spite of crossing every red line the cybersecurity world has tried to draw to protect\ncivilian critical infrastructure from catastrophic hacking, Sandworm's members had never\nbeen charged or even officially named in connection with those attacks. Until now.\n\nOn Monday, the Department of Justice unsealed charges including computer fraud and\nconspiracy against six of the hackers who allegedly make up Sandworm, a group also known\nin the security industry by the names Telebots, Voodoo Bear, and Hades, and confirmed\nearlier this year to work in Unit 74455 of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency based in\na building known as the Tower in the Moscow suburb of Khimki. The indictment names all six\nRussian men, who are in their late twenties to early thirties: Yuriy Sergeyevich Andrienko,\nSergey Vladimirovich Detistov Pavel Valeryevich Frolov Artem Valeryevich Ochichenko and\n\n\n-----\n\nPetr Nikolayevich Pliskin, as well as Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev, who was previously\nindicted two years ago for his allegedly role into hacking US States' Boards of Election in\n2016.\n\nCourtesy of Department of Justice\n\n“No country has weaponized its cyber capabilities as maliciously or irresponsibly as Russia,\nwantonly causing unprecedented damage to pursue small tactical advantages and to satisfy\nfits of spite,” assistant attorney general John Demers said in a statement.\n\n\"They continue to do disruptive and destructive attacks against anyone they perceive to be\nan adversary to Russia or to have slighted Russia in some way,\" added a senior Justice\nDepartment official who asked not to be identified, in a call with WIRED. \"This is probably\none of the most dangerous and aggressive groups of hackers that’s out there.\"\n\nThe charges represent not only the first criminal charges against Sandworm for its most\ndestructive attacks, but the first time that most of the charged hackers have been publicly\nidentified as members of the hacker group. Two other GRU hackers believed to be part of\nSandworm—Aleksey Aleksandrovich Potemkin and Aleksandr Vladimirovich Osadchuk—\nwere previously named in the separate, 2018 indictment of 12 GRU hackers for hacking that\ninterfered in the 2016 US election. Kovalev, who in the new indictment is accused of helping\nto [hack the 2017 campaign of French president Emmanuel Macron, was also named in those](https://www.wired.com/story/sandworm-russia-cyberattack-links/)\n2018 charges.\n\nThe new indictment also represents the first official acknowledgement from the US\ngovernment that Sandworm was responsible for a cyberattack on the 2018 Winter Olympics,\n[in which a piece of malware known as Olympic Destroyer took down much of the IT](https://www.wired.com/story/untold-story-2018-olympics-destroyer-cyberattack/)\ninfrastructure of the Games just as the opening ceremony was beginning in Pyeongchang,\nSouth Korea. Olympic Destroyer contained layers of \"false flags,\" spoofed clues in its code\ndesigned to trick investigators into blaming North Korea or China. And according to the new\nindictment, Sandworm also tried to breach two Olympic partner organizations responsible for\ntimekeeping in the Olympics, not just the Wifi, Olympics app, ticketing, and displays that\nwere ultimately disrupted—perhaps an attempt to corrupt the Olympics sporting events'\nactual results, too.\n\nIn the more than two years that followed, no government in the world officially seemed willing\nto blame the cyberattack on Russia, even as private intelligence firms like FireEye found\n[strong evidence of Sandworm's involvement, and US intelligence leaked their findings of](https://www.wired.com/story/untold-story-2018-olympics-destroyer-cyberattack/)\n[Russia's culpability to The Washington Post. (The European Union did finally name \"Olympic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-spies-hacked-the-olympics-and-tried-to-make-it-look-like-north-korea-did-it-us-officials-say/2018/02/24/44b5468e-18f2-11e8-92c9-376b4fe57ff7_story.html)\n[Destroyer\" as one of the known names for Sandworm in sanctions against the group in July,](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/eu-announces-first-sanctions-under-eu-57696/)\nbut without explicitly saying that the sanctions were in response to the Olympics attack.)\n\n\n-----\n\n[That long silence led to warnings from the cybersecurity community that Russia would no](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/12/04/we-need-hold-kremlin-responsible-its-cyberattack-olympics/)\ndoubt attempt to attack the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, too. And separately from the Sandworm\nindictment, those warnings were proven true today when the UK's National Cybersecurity\nCenter revealed that it had tracked, in a joint operation with US intelligence agencies,\nreconnaissance activities by Russian hackers seeking to disrupt the 2020 Olympics as\npredicted—though the games were ultimately delayed due to Covid-19—targeting the\ngames' organizers, logistics partners, and sponsors.\n\nThe Justice Department's new indictment against the hackers includes a long history of other\nGRU hacking around the world: The hackers allegedly targeted the Organization for the\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom’s Defense\nScience and Technology Laboratory while those two organizations were investigating the\nNovichok poisoning of GRU defector Sergei Skripal and his daughter, an attack not\n[previously linked to Sandworm despite known GRU involvement. The indictment also lays](https://www.wired.com/story/russian-spies-indictment-hotel-wi-fi-hacking/)\nout new details of Sandworm's targeting of the nation of Georgia in 2019, which included an\nattempt to compromise the Georgian parliament in addition to a previously known campaign\nof web defacements across the country's internet, affecting 15,000 sites.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, the criminal charges mark the first global law enforcement\nresponse targeting Sandworm's hackers for their release of the NotPetya malware that\nravaged networks across the world. To initially install its data-destroying, self-spreading code\non its victims' machines, Sandworm hijacked the update mechanism of MEDoc, a common\npiece of Ukrainian accounting software. But beyond infecting hundreds of Ukrainian\ncompanies and government agencies, NotPetya also spread far beyond Ukraine's borders,\ninflicting $10 billion in damage to companies including Merck, FedEx, Maersk, Mondelez, as\nwell as paralyzing updates to medical record systems in hospitals across the US and causing\nserious collateral damage to Russian firms, too.\n\nThe indictment accuses Andrienko, Detistov, Frolov, and Pliskin specifically of developing\ndifferent components of the NotPetya malware. It goes so far as to state that Andrienko and\nPliskin \"celebrated\" after the malware was deployed.\n\nDespite US and EU sanctions against Russia for NotPetya, no hackers were criminally\ncharged with the global cyberattack, or even named as individually responsible for it, until\nnow. That apparent inaction led many in the cybersecurity world to marvel for years at\nWestern governments' failure to hold Sandworm accountable. “NotPetya tested the red lines\nof the West, and the result of the test was that there are no red lines yet,” Johns Hopkins\n[professor of strategic studies Thomas Rid told WIRED in 2018. “The lack of any proper](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/)\nresponse is almost an invitation to escalate more.”\n\nNow, however belatedly, that accountability has arrived for Sandworm's hackers. But as with\nso many indictments of foreign, state-sponsored hackers, the defendants will likely never see\nthe inside of a US courtroom, given their protection by the Russian government.\nNonetheless, indictments against foreign hackers limit their ability to use the Western\n\n\n-----\n\nfinancial system or to travel to any country that may have an extradition agreement with the\nUS. \"We have an obligation to hold accountable those who commit crimes— no matter\nwhere they reside and no matter for whom they work—in order to seek justice on behalf of\nthese victims,\" US attorney Scott W. Brady said in a statement.\n\nThe Sandworm indictment also sends a message to the GRU and others hackers engaged in\nreckless attacks around the world that they, too, can be named and shamed, says John\nHultquist, director of intelligence at FireEye, who first named Sandworm in 2014 and has\ntracked the hackers across their long, chaotic career. \"It's obviously great that they're finally\nbeing accused,\" Hultquist says.\n\nA Justice Department official speaking to WIRED denied that the timing of the indictment was\nrelated to the approach of Election Day in just two weeks. \"We charge the cases when\nthey're ready to be charged,\" the official said.\n\nBut Hultquist notes that Sandworm was, in fact, involved in the 2016 election interference,\nand that Microsoft has already linked another GRU group known as Fancy Bear or APT28 to\n[attempts to breach campaigns and other political organizations involved in the 2020 election.](https://www.wired.com/story/russias-fancy-bear-hackers-are-hitting-us-campaign-targets-again/)\n\"Plainly, I think they're attempting to discourage them from acting in this election by using\nlegal tools and outing their involvement in other incidents,\" Hultquist says of the Justice\nDepartment's indictment.\n\nElection aside, the signaling to state-sponsored hackers is clear, belated as it may be, says\nHultquist: \"We know who you are and what you’ve done,\" he says. And the consequences of\nthat knowledge will catch up with hackers who cross red lines—even if it takes five years.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n[📩 Want the latest on tech, science, and more?
