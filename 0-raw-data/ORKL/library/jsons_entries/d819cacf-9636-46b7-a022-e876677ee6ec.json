This malware is also detected\nas Trojan:Win32/Feury.B!cl.\n\nSyscoin developers are now warning Syscoin users who downloaded version 3.0.4.1 of the\nSyscoin client between June 09th, 2018 10:14 PM UTC and June 13th, 2018 10:23 PM\n**UTC that their systems might be infected with malware.**\n\nThe affected files are (version number included in the file name is 3.0.4, but they install\nversion 3.0.4.1):\n\nsyscoincore-3.0.4-win32-setup.exe\n\nsyscoincore-3.0.4-win64-setup.exe\n\n## Only Syscoin Windows client affected\n\n\n-----\n\nHackers only tampered with the Windows client and no other files available in the v3.0.4.1\nrelease, which also included Mac and Linux clients, along with the adjacent source code.\n\nThe Syscoin clients are installed on an operating system and allow users to run a Syscoin\nnode, which they can use to mine new Syscoin cryptocurrency or manage Syscoin funds.\n\nThe incident came to light yesterday when the Syscoin team received a warning from users\nthat Windows Defender SmartScreen was marking downloads of the Syscoin Windows\nclient as malicious.\n\n## What users need to do\n\nAfter a thorough investigation of the report, the Syscoin team discovered that a hacker\ncompromised one of its developers' GitHub accounts, and took actions to remove the\nmalicious files and warn users.\n\nAll Windows users should identify their installation date:\n\nRight-click on syscoin-qt.exe in\nC:\\Users[USERNAME]\\AppData\\Roaming\\SyscoinCore or view in detailed list mode\nand make a note of the modified date.\nOR go to Settings->Apps and make a note of the installation date.\n\nIf the modified/installation date is between June 9th, 2018, and June 13th, 2018, take the\nfollowing precautions:\n\nBackup any important data including wallets onto another storage medium outside of\nthe affected computer. Treat this data cautiously as it may contain infectious code.\nRun an up-to-date virus scanner on your system to remove the threat.\nPasswords entered since the time of the infection should be changed from a separate\ndevice after ensuring the threat has been removed.\nFunds in unencrypted wallets or wallets that had been unlocked during the infection\nperiod, should be moved to a newly generated wallet on a secure computer.\n\nUsers who downloaded the Syscoin client between the above-mentioned interval but did not\ninstall it are advised to delete it and redownload a clean version.\n\n[While there are online guides with instructions on how to remove this particular malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/648141/trojanwin32fuerybcl/)\nstrain, it's probably a better idea if users wiped and reinstalled the entire OS, just to be on\nthe safe side.\n\nThe Syscoin team also announced that all of its developers with access to its GitHub\naccount would also be forced to use two-factor authentication (2FA) and perform routine\n(file signature) checks of the files offered for download to detect similar incidents where\nhackers replace files in the future.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Fake Binance NFT Mystery Box bots steal victim's crypto wallets](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-binance-nft-mystery-box-bots-steal-victims-crypto-wallets/)\n\n[New powerful Prynt Stealer malware sells for just $100 per month](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-powerful-prynt-stealer-malware-sells-for-just-100-per-month/)\n\n[Beanstalk DeFi platform loses $182 million in flash-loan attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beanstalk-defi-platform-loses-182-million-in-flash-loan-attack/)\n\n[Cryptocurrency DeFi platforms are now more targeted than ever](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cryptocurrency-defi-platforms-are-now-more-targeted-than-ever/)\n\n[GitHub: Attackers stole login details of 100K npm user accounts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-attackers-stole-login-details-of-100k-npm-user-accounts/)\n\n[Altcoin](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/altcoin/)\n[CryptoCurrency](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cryptocurrency/)\n[GitHub](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/github/)\n[Hack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hack/)\n[Information Stealer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/information-stealer/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a\nfew more.
