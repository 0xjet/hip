They have a history of targeting many\nindustries, including healthcare, and continue to develop their capabilities and increase their targeting frequency.\n\n##### Report\nMespinoza (also known as GOLD BURLAP and CYBORG SPIDER) is a financially-motivated cybercriminal group\n[initially observed engaging in cyberattacks in October 2018. They developed and operated their own ransomware](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2020-CTI-003.pdf)\nvariant (PYSA), which after undergoing several updates, began encrypting victim files with the .pysa extension in\nDecember 2019. They also regularly use a number of other tools including ADRecon, Advanced Port Scanner,\nDNSGo RAT, Mimikatz, PEASS and PowerShell Empire. By the end of 2020, Intel471 considered them to be a “rising\npower” and as of November 2021, they are known to have accumulated at least 190 global victims via ransomware\nattacks alone. PYSA is cross-platform ransomware and versions are developed in both the C++ and Python\nlanguages.\n\nMespinoza operates a leak site called, “Pysa’s Partners”, which it uses to leverage “name and shame” tactics to\napply additional pressure to compel victims to pay ransoms. Mespinoza is not known to operate as ransomware as a\nservice (RaaS). The top five countries targeted by Pysa are the US, UK, Canada, Spain, and Brazil. Figure 1 depicts\ntheir total global targeting, with the color corresponding to the number of victims in each country (scale at bottom):\n\n_Figure 1: PYSA Ransomware Heat Map (Source: Cyble)_\n\n\n-----\n\n## HC3: Analyst Note\n###    January 6, 2022     TLP: White   Report: 202201061700\n\nPYSA is used to target industries like education, utilities, transportation, construction, business services and, most\nnotably, the healthcare and public health (HPH) sector. Although the Pysa variant has only been known to be\noperating since December 2019, it quickly became one of the more prolific threats against healthcare. In 2020, it\nwas one of the top ten ransomware variants used to target healthcare (per Crowdstrike data, see figure 2), beating\nout many other well-known variants such as Clop, Lockbit, Nemty, RagnarLocker, Avvadon, MountLocker and\nSunCrypt.\n\n_Figure 2: Source: Crowdstrike_\n\nThe Cyber Peace Institute has also reported on ransomware groups targeting healthcare during the pandemic. They\nfound Pysa was one of the most aggressive among all ransomware groups in targeting healthcare over the last two\nyears. (see figure 3) Furthermore, they noted that unlike some cybercriminal groups who made public promises to\n\n\n-----\n\n## HC3: Analyst Note\n###    January 6, 2022     TLP: White   Report: 202201061700\n\nrefrain from targeting healthcare during the pandemic or others who simply didn’t make any statement, Pysa\nthreatened healthcare specifically and then followed through with those promises.\n\n_Figure 3: Ransomware targeting of healthcare during the pandemic_\n\nThe Cyber Peace Institute’s data also reflects Pysa as having launched some of the largest ransomware attacks\nagainst health targets during the pandemic. (see figure 4)\n\n_Figure 4: Top 10 Ransomware Operators vs. the Health Sector During the Pandemic_\n\n\n-----\n\n## HC3: Analyst Note\n###    January 6, 2022     TLP: White   Report: 202201061700\n\nPysa often follows a standard execution flow (see figure 5). It often begins by creating a mutual exclusion object\n(mutex) which it does for the same reason legitimate applications do – to ensure two processes or threads don’t\nattempt to write to the same memory space simultaneously. It then goes on to begin its basic reconnaissance\nfunctions by enumerating the drives on the victim system by leveraging the application programming interfaces\nGetLogicalDriveStringsW, GetDriveTypeW and CreateThread. Once it identifies drives, it compares them to a whitelist\nand then begins to identify individual files for encryption, which it encrypts via Advanced Encryption Standard 256\nwith the extension .pysa (hence the ransomware variant name). It then creates two registry keys under\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System, one with the name legalnoticetext having\nthe ransom note as its value and one named legalnoticecaption having the value “PYSA”. It then releases the mutex\nand creates and executes a batch file (update.bat) which contains the self-deletion commands. Additional details on\nthis execution flow and other technical details of a Pysa attack can be found on [the Cyble blog, the DFIR Report](https://blog.cyble.com/2021/11/29/pysa-ransomware-under-the-lens-a-deep-dive-analysis/)\n[analysis, as well as the report from the French national CERT.](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2020-CTI-003.pdf)\n\n_Figure 5: Execution flow of PYSA Ransomware (Source: Cyble)_\n\nPysa has known to leverage several tools for command and control (C2) communications including RDP, PowerShell\n[Empire and Kodiac. Beginning in May of 2021, Pysa ransomware has been used to target VMWare ESXi systems for](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/hypervisor-jackpotting-ecrime-actors-increase-targeting-of-esxi-servers/)\nencryption where they then move laterally via root access and enable SSH for further exploit via remote shell. The\n[FBI released a flash alert on Pysa](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/210316.pdf) in March of 2021.\n\n##### Analyst Comment\nMany of the fundamental operational aspects of the Mespinioza group or Pysa ransomware variant are not\nsignificantly different than other similar cybercriminal groups or ransomware. The same basic principles apply, and\nany organization wishing to protect itself from Mespinioza/Pysa should consider the following guidance:\n\n\n-----\n\n## HC3: Analyst Note\n###    January 6, 2022     TLP: White   Report: 202201061700\n\n1. Design and operate enterprise networks with basic cybersecurity principles in mind, especially defense of depth\nand the principle-of-least-privilege. This includes architecting the network in a segmented way that balances\nsecurity with operations, managing multiple layers of filtering and threat detection applications, and ensuring\nperiodic reviews of user requirements and privileges. For healthcare operations, ransomware used to disrupt\noperations and data theft (for subsequent sale on the dark web) are two of the more significant threats and\nthese principles can help defend against such attacks.\n\n2. Protect against the common infection vectors. Operating and maintaining an effective vulnerability management\nprogram is critical to this aspect of enterprise cybersecurity. Ensure remote access technologies such as virtual\nprivate networks (VPNs) and applications that leverage the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) are locked down and\nconfigured in such a way to minimize their exposure. Ensure the principle-of-least-privilege also applies to these\ntools as well in terms of who can use them, when and how. Continuous, real-time monitoring should ensure\nenterprise policy compliance for all aspects of their use. Phishing attacks should be taken seriously and efforts\nto curtail them include awareness training, filtering and endpoint security.\n\n3. Continuously ensure your organization’s attack surface is minimized. This begins with the previously mentioned\nvulnerability management efforts and also includes 24/7/365 monitoring of the enterprise nework.\nFurthermore, ensuring indicators of compromise (IoCs) are appropriately operationalized and continuous\nmonitoring for incidents is ongoing. Hunt efforts are also recommended in this effort.\n\nAn effort should be made to constantly gather and deploy indicators of compromise in accordance with the\norganizational risk management plan. It’s worth noting that infrastructure associated IoCs often are often\nabandoned by cybercriminals after they become public but can also be reused over time as well.
