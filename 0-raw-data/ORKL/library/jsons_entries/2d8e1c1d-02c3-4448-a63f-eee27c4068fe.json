Since its rise, Cryptocurrency has been attacked\nrelentlessly by criminals looking to take advantage of its wild popularity—both state-sponsored actors[5]\nand rogues acting as bank robbers[6]. In this threat report, we’ll focus on Ethereum[7], also known as 'Ether,'\nand its relation to an online service called MyEtherWallet (MEW) which is the target of a phishing\nautomated transfer system (ATS) we have dubbed MEWKit.\n\nWhat makes MEWkit stand out is that it's so much more than a traditional phishing kit. Beyond being a\nfront-end mimicking the MyEtherWallet website with the purpose of stealing credentials, it's also a clientside application that processes the payment details captured by the phishing page to transfer funds out\nof phished victim Ethereum wallets directly to attacker-controlled wallets.\n\nIn this report, we'll discuss more detail on the functionality, background, and past and current campaigns\nusing MEWKit. We'll also shed some light on a significant event that happened on April 24, 2018, in which\na Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijack attack was performed on the Amazon DNS servers to reroute\npeople from the official MyEtherWallet website to a host running MEWKit.\n\n1.

[https://www.wired.com/2014/03/bitcoin-exchange/](https://www.wired.com/2014/03/bitcoin-exchange/)\n\n[7. https://www.ethereum.org/](https://www.ethereum.org/)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Understanding the Crime: Understanding the Target\n\nMyEtherWallet is unlike other cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms because it does not have\ninternal accounts. On a typical exchange—similar to how a bank would work—a user creates an account\nto which they can transfer funds in and out. This way, the exchange has the keys to their wallet with the\naccount providing an additional layer of security and adding controls such as two-factor authentication\nand security questions. These banks and exchanges are also able to perform analytics to see what device\nis being used to log in, and from where.\n\nMyEtherWallet, on the other hand, takes out the middle step of having an account and gives users a wallet\nonly, allowing them to interact with the Ethereum network directly. This access makes MyEtherWallet an\nextremely transparent experience, but without the added security layers of most banks and exchanges, it\nalso creates some significant risks and makes it a prominent target for attack.\n\nOnce a phishing attack is successful on a MEWKit victim thinking they are interacting with the official\nMyEtherWallet website, funds are directly accessible to the attackers. Because of this, we believe MEWKit\nwas born a phishing ATS build specifically for MyEtherWallet.\n\n\n-----\n\n### MEWKit Technical Analysis\n\nMEWKit consists of two parts: a phishing page mimicking the MyEtherWallet site and a server-side\ncomponent that handles logging and the wallets to which attackers transfer stolen funds once a phishing\nattack succeeds. While typical phishing pages usually redirect to the legitimate version of the website\nso the victim can log in again, MEWKit simply abuses MyEtherWallet’s unique access to the Ethereum\nnetwork via the victim's browser to make the transactions in the background.\n\nMEWKit is referred to as Automated Transfer System by its author because any phished information\nit captures is immediately used to transfer funds from the victim’s wallet. The concept of an ATS for\nmalicious financial gain comes from malware operations that inject scripts into active web sessions on\nfinancial websites to transfer funds out of the victim’s account and silently and invisibly automate the\nexecution of bank transfers just seconds after the owners of infected PCs logged into their bank accounts.\n\nOnce a user logs in, MEWKit checks their wallet’s balance and requests a receiver address from the server\nside. It then leverages the standard MyEtherWallet functionality by setting the attacker-owned wallet as\nthe receiving address and transferring out the victim’s entire balance.\n\n#### The MEWKit Phishing Page\n\nBecause MyEtherWallet is run completely client-side and capable of being run offline, you can download\na build of it manually—and we think this is exactly what the author of MEWKit did. The source code for\n[MyEtherWallet can be downloaded from its GitHub here: https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet](https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet)\n\nMEWKit consists of a MyEtherWallet build with some added scripts. It embeds two additional javascript\nresources in the page, typically named: sm.js and wallet.js both (usually) loaded from the same\ndirectory as the legitimate MyEtherWallet scripts filepaths.\n\n##### wallet.js - Configuration\n\nThis script functions as a configuration file for the rest of MEWKit. It has two options to set:\n\n `js_stat`\n\nThis variable contains a string with the location of the backend, which the author calls the ‘admin\npanel.’ The value of this variable is used to obtain recipient addresses to which to transfer funds and\nsend logs of everything that happens on the page.\n\n `user_in_page`\n\nWhile the variable name is somewhat obscure, it simply enables or turns off logging. It has an\ninteger value of 1 to enable logging and 0 for no logging.\n\n##### sm.js - Core\n\nThis script contains the functional part of MEWKit and hooks into the source of MyEtherWallet. The top of\nthe script contains a set of global variables:\n\n `____pwd`\n\nWill contain the victim’s mnemonic phrase or password / keystore JSON file content for their wallet.\n\n\n-----\n\n `ikey`\n\nCurrently not used in any version of MEWKit we observed. It is sent out in all the callbacks to the\nbackend, but no value is ever set other than its initial value of ‘none.’\n\n `txt_ua`\n\nContains the victim’s user agent with the result of a call to navigator.userAgent.\n\n **send_block_flg**\n\nContains a binary 0 or 1 flag. The flag is set to 0 once a victim decrypts their wallet so the ATS will\nkick in to process a fund transfer of the available balance. It will not start a transfer when the flag is\n1 as to block or let through any ongoing transactions.\n\n `balance`\n\nContains the available balance in the victim’s wallet once he/she logs into the MEWKit\nMyEtherWallet page.\n\n `eth_recipient`\n\nContains the recipient address controlled by the actor to which stolen funds will be transferred.\n\n **balance_block_flg**\n\nContains a binary 0 or 1 flag. The flag is set to 0 once a victim decrypts their wallet so the ATS will\nkick in to check for the available balance in the victim’s wallet.\n\n **count_flg**\n\nContains a binary 0 or 1 flag. The flag is set to 1, which also triggers a fake countdown MEWKit page\nwhen MEWKit starts to obtain the wallet credentials to start and initiate a transfer of the available\nbalance.\n\nAfter these global variables, the script contains a set of functions to phish and automate fund transfers.\nWe won’t explain every function specifically, but we will show the flow of execution of the kit.\n\n##### MEWKit hooks in MyEtherWallet Source\n\nMEWKit hooks into the normal functionality of MyEtherWallet, so we’ll walk through the hooks it places\none by one. The first presence of MEWKit in the MyEtherWallet source can be found in the <header>\nsection of the main page. The two MEWKit scripts and a jQuery script have been added:\n\n\n-----\n\nJust below the header, we ll find a call to a function from MEWKit in the <body> tag:\n\nThis function disables the button which normally allows a user to view their wallet information and\nbalance. It also makes sure the button to start a transaction will disable any other buttons on the page so\na user can’t go anywhere else.\n\nThe next MEWKit function call can be seen in the body:\n\nThis function ensures that the welcome message, normally showing ‘MyEtherWallet.com,’ gets updated\nwith the correct website name. The reason for this is that the phishing pages aren’t always typosquats of\nMyEtherWallet.com—sometimes they’re a variation of the word ‘Ethereum’ alongside other words. This\nfunction call ensures that the window title and page information match the website the user is visiting, so\nthe actor doesn’t have to change the build for every page they set up.\n\nThe next function call to MEWKit is hooked into the button that allows visitors to see their wallet balance:\n\nThis function will execute when a visitor clicks the wallet balance button and will redirect the flow of the\nscript to where the user would have clicked to start a transaction so that when the MyEtherWallet code\nkicks in, the fund transfer functionality will be available in the code, which MEWKit requires to begin a\ntransaction.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs an added touch, MEWKit will change the normal visuals on the MyEtherWallet page. Typically, the\nbutton for the page the user is on would be highlighted, but MEWKit highlights the ‘View Wallet Info’\nwhile the user is on the fund transfer page. The ‘View Wallet Info’ button also sends users to the fund\ntransfer page. We can see this behavior when we visit a MEWKit instance—notice the disabled visibility of\nthe Ether-sending header normally shown:\n\nThe last hook-in from MEWKit into MyEtherWallet is not in the HTML page, but rather in the official source\nfiles: etherwallet-master.js. MyEtherWallet itself is written using the AngularJS framework, which\nallows developers to build dynamic functioning webpages rather than static HTML pages. AngularJS\nallows them to template functionality and elements to provide a dynamic website experience more easily.\n\nMEWKit hooks into angular JS by adding a function call for the onclick event when a user decrypts their\nwallet for usage with MyEtherWallet. The function put in place is called PrivateKey_decryptWallet,\nwhich will be covered at length in the next chapter, which discusses the ATS execution flow. We can see\nthe hooked-in function in the javascript source file, which is a mess due to it being an AngularJS file:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can see the hook in action on the page where we re supposedly viewing our wallet info but are\nactually starting a transaction, as shown in the previous screenshot. Below is the hook-in for MEWKit to\nget the content of the decrypted wallet:\n\nAs shown, these functions will not start a transfer on their own. The above functions simply prep the page\nfor the phishing attack on the user.\n\n##### ATS Execution flow\n\nWhen a user hits a MEWKit page, it’s prepped for phishing and ATS functionality as shown above. After\nthe preparations, one function will execute every time: a logging call-out to the backend, which will only\nexecute when the user_in_page variable from wallet.js is set to 1 (enabling the log callout):\n\n\n-----\n\nThe send_data_login_ function is used throughout the functioning of the ATS, and we ll explain its\nfunctionality below for later reference. The way MEWKit performs its callouts to the backend is quite\ninteresting—it constructs a URL based on the arguments provided to the function and from the global\nvariables. The URL is then embedded as a new script resource in the main page, which makes the browser\nperform the callout. Here is the function:\n\nAs shown, the send_data_login_ function constructs a URL which is then put in a new script element\nthat appends to the <head> of the document. Below is an example on a MEWKit instance performing the\ninitial callout:\n\nThe interesting thing about this method is what happens in return. The server returns a small javascript\nsnippet that sets a global variable named jsess_msg, which is relevant for the rest of the ATS\nfunctionality later. Here is what the backend returns based on the log messages:\n\nThere is one other version of this function called send_data_login_pv, as it is modified to log the private\nkey of a wallet to the backend server. This version, which has formatting to also encode and send the\nprivate key out, is called only when the user uploads the private key to access their wallet, as the private\nkey file content is also forwarded to the backend.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe actual ATS functionality starts when the victim decrypts their wallet through the methods supported\nby MyEtherWallet, which triggers the onclick event to the PrivateKey_decryptWallet function. This\nfunction goes through all the different authentication options the user can use and logs what method\nthe user did use. It then starts the automated transfer code. Below is a piece of the function, which is\nrepeated for every authentication method:\n\nYou can see that MEWKit will log the authentication method the user used, set the balance, and send\nflags to 0 and call the check_send_block function.\n\nBefore we jump into the check_send_block function, there is something crucial to understand: this\nspecific highlighted example uses the send_data_login_pv function which also sends the wallet’s private\nkey to the backend. This means that the MEWKit attacks will still have access to a victim’s wallet after\n_phishing them. If they purchase more Ethereum, the attackers can continue to drain their funds._\n\nThe same applies to another authentication method. Using the keyfile / JSON file upload method sends\nout the uploaded file to the backend, which also allows the actor behind MEWKit to continue to have\naccess to a victim’s wallet:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sendAjaxForm function will send the uploaded file to a script called post.php on the backend, which\nis prefixed by the js_stat config variable for the backend path.\n\nThe check_send_block function will check if the victim successfully authenticated by seeing if the send\nfunctionality if available:\n\nThis function will keep calling itself but will continue blocking with a flag until a victim can start\ntransactions.\n\nThen the code jumps into the check_balance_block function:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile this function looks complicated, all it s doing is checking what the balance of the wallet is by\nparsing the HTML manually. Once it can determine an available balance, it will log it to the backend and\ncall the check_valid_balance function:\n\nThe check_valid_balance function checks if the balance is positive. If it isn’t, it will log a message to the\nbackend stating ‘Stop ATS.’ If it does have a positive balance, it will continue the execution flow by calling\nthe get_address function. This function is quite interesting because it is similar to the logging function in\nthat it constructs and embeds a script resource URL that makes the browser call out to the backend. This\nURL, which is used for getting recipient addresses is static, and only the current timestamp is appended\nto the end of the URL.\n\nThe time stamp is appended to the URL because browsers usually play it smart, and if the same resource\nis appended twice it, will just use the cached result. Adding this timestamp, however, will make the URL\nunique, ensuring an updated response from the backend server:\n\nThe LoadScript function creates a new script element and sets the URL to the one generated by\n```\nget_address. Once the resource has been loaded, it will call the get_state_address function to continue\n\n```\nthe execution flow.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe get_state_address function is a parser for the value set in the jsess_msg variable, which is sent by\nthe backend via the LoadScript function. The parsing of the message looks like this:\n\nThe get_state_address parses the variable content by cutting and slicing the string value response to\nparse out the recipient address to which to transfer stolen funds. If the response of the message contains\n```\n[EMPTY,] MEWKit will stop processing and note in the log that there was no recipient. If it was able to\n\n```\nget an address out of the response, it will call the set_data function, which is the final step of transferring\nfunds.\n\nThe set_data function will prepare a transaction by setting a recipient address, triggering the input\nchange, and hitting the transfer button before queuing the set_get_trans function with a small delay.\nClicking the transfer button will take the user to the transaction overview page. Then, the set_get_trans\nfunction quickly pushes the button to generate the transaction record, after which it queues the\n```\nset_yes_mk_trans function, which in turn, confirms the transaction. This kicks off the balance transfer,\n\n```\nthereby stealing the available balance from the victim’s wallet.\n\n\n-----\n\nBasically, these last few functions automate creating, confirming, and beginning the fund transfer by\npressing the buttons like a legitimate user would. Below is all of the functionality in the MEWKit core we\ndescribed above:\n\nThis kind of functionality—enabling the theft of Ethereum in an automated way—is not something we’ve\nseen before in a phishing kit.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### The MEWKit Server\n\nAs shown above, MEWKit’s major piece of functionality, the ATS, is run entirely client-side in JavaScript.\nThe backend for MEWKit is only used for:\n\n Log storage: Every step in the ATS is logged per victim, which is all reported to the backend\n\n Private key and password storage: If a user logs in using a mnemonic or password, it is logged and\n\nextracted on the C2 and stored for later access.\n\n Recipient address supply: The recipient addresses for the actor are maintained on the backend and\n\ngiven out to clients being phished.\n\nFor the most part, the backend server of a MEWKit instance gives the actor an overview of how well their\ncampaign is doing.\n\n#### MEWKit limitations: Hardware Wallets\n\nWhile MyEtherWallet has support for various hardware wallets such as Trezor[8], Ledger Wallet[9], Digital\nBitbox[10] and Secalot[11] MEWKit does not support stealing keys from these. This inability to steal keys from\nhardware wallets means those who are phished by MEWKit while using a hardware-based wallet will be\naffected by MEWKit’s ATS but still need to confirm the transaction on their wallet before it processes\nbecause hardware wallets’ private keys are stored inside and are therefore are not exposed to MEWKit.\n\nSudden, unexplained transactions are a good sign of hitting MEWKit and, of course, not accepting\nthe transaction is the course to take. Keep in mind that MEWKit does log any attempted logins using\nhardware wallets, it is just not able to automate fund transfers using its ATS.\n\n8. [https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/)\n\n9.

Any\nIOCs mentioned in the sections below have also been formatted in the Indicators of Compromise (IOC)\nsection at the end of this report.\n\nDo note that we haven’t described every MEWKit phishing site we observed, just the ones that stood\nout for reasons described in each subsection. The full list of all hosts we observed can be found in the\nIndicators of Compromise section near the end of this report.\n\n#### Overreaching: Hijacking Amazon Route 53\n\nOn April 24th at a little after 11:00 UTC, a border gateway protocol (BGP) hijack was performed targeting\nIP space associated with Amazon Route 53[12], which is an Amazon DNS provisioning system. What this\nmeans is that an unauthorized party was able to reroute a portion of the traffic intended to reach Amazon\nRoute 53 to itself and reroute domain resolutions to an endpoint of their own choice.\n\n##### Rerouting MyEtherWallet visitors\n\nThe following IP blocks normally announced (and maintained) under Amazon’s AS16509 were announced\nby eNet under AS10297[13]:\n\n 205.251.192.0/24\n\n 205.251.193.0/24\n\n 205.251.195.0/24\n\n 205.251.197.0/24\n\n 205.251.199.0/24\n\nThese IP addresses are part of Amazon Route 53 performing DNS routing for any domains maintained\nthrough this service. The new endpoint for the above IP blocks residing in AS10297 started to route some\nof the traffic intended for Route 53 and replying to DNS queries from users.\n\nWe can actually see a bump in prefixes announced by this AS in comparison to the very fixed set of\nblocks it normally announces:\n\n[Source: https://bgp.he.net/AS10297](https://bgp.he.net/AS10297)\n\n[12. https://aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)\n\n[13. https://blog.cloudflare.com/bgp-leaks-and-crypto-currencies/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/bgp-leaks-and-crypto-currencies/)\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, the DNS servers that ended up handling the traffic normally intended for Route 53 were\nonly setup with a single domain to resolve: myetherwallet[.]com. Any other requested domain would get\na SERVFAIL response, which people did notice[14]. The new DNS server responded with a new IP address\nfor MyEtherWallet, 46.161.42.42, which resides in AS41995. According to geolocation, this server routes\nfrom Russia. If we pull up some of the WHOIS information on this AS, it doesn’t bode well:\n\nWHOIS Source: RIPE NCC\n\nIP Address 46.161.42.42\n\nCountry Russian Federation\n\nNetwork Name WebShield\n\nOwner Name WebShield Network\n\nCIDR 46.161.42.0/24\n\nContact Name Kucharavenka Ihar Valerievich\n\nAddress Lesi Ukrainki, 9, Kiev, Ukraine\n\nEmail webshieldsup@gmail.com\n\nAbuse Email\n\nPhone +380 95 5037029\n\nFax\n\nHaving an AS assigned in eastern Europe with email addresses from free services like Gmail in the WHOIS\nis usually a bad sign. We can get a little more information on this address from organization WHOIS\ndetails:\n\nOrganisation ORG-WS171-RIPE\n\nOrganisation Name Barbarich_Viacheslav_Yuryevich\n\nOrganisation Type Other\n\nRussia\n\nAddress Marks\n\n5-ya liniya, d.17\n\nEmail admin@web-shield.biz\n\n14. https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2018-April/011257.html\n\n|WHOIS Source:|RIPE NCC|\n|---|---|\n|IP Address|46.161.42.42|\n|Country|Russian Federation|\n|Network Name|WebShield|\n|Owner Name|WebShield Network|\n|CIDR|46.161.42.0/24|\n|Contact Name|Kucharavenka Ihar Valerievich|\n|Address|Lesi Ukrainki, 9, Kiev, Ukraine|\n|Email|webshieldsup@gmail.com|\n|Abuse Email||\n|Phone|+380 95 5037029|\n|Fax||\n\n|Organisation|ORG-WS171-RIPE|\n|---|---|\n|Organisation Name|Barbarich_Viacheslav_Yuryevich|\n|Organisation Type|Other|\n|Address|Russia Marks 5-ya liniya, d.17|\n|Email|admin@web-shield.biz|\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to WHOIS information, the domain for the email address has existed since the end of 2014 and\nits details have always resided behind WHOIS privacy services. Currently, the main hosting website on\nweb-shield[.]biz is offline, but looking in archival data we can find an old hosting company website:\n\nWebshield is familiar to many people in our industry because there have been many sites used for\nmalicious purposes in their IP space, an example of which is Rescator[15]. What’s most interesting to us is\nthat the hoster owning this AS has closed its web hosting site but still provides hosting opportunities. We\nclassify Webshield as a bulletproof hoster[16].\n\n[15. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescator)\n\n16. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletproof hosting\n\n\n-----\n\n##### The Ether Heist: Automating Fund Transfers with MEWKit\n\nWhile the attack against Amazon Route 53 was very sophisticated, the setup the attackers used for the\nphishing site on the server hosted on the Webshield AS was not. The certificate they put up on the server\nwasn’t actually a valid certificate; they created their own self-signed certificate using WHOIS details from\nmyetherwallet[.]com, which is behind a WHOIS privacy service. Here is the WHOIS for MyEtherWallet:\n\n[Source: https://community.riskiq.com/search/myetherwallet.com](https://community.riskiq.com/search/myetherwallet.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nHere is the SSL certificate we ve observed on the Webshield host with MEWKit:\n\n[Source: https://community.riskiq.com/search/certificate/sha1/4ee8ad8ef36d1e4461526997b78415b6dc306ee3](https://community.riskiq.com/search/certificate/sha1/4ee8ad8ef36d1e4461526997b78415b6dc306ee3)\n\nThe attackers simply generated a certificate based on the WHOIS details, which was flagged by pretty\nmuch any modern day web browser. However, it seems people still clicked through these warnings as\nsome people reported funds being withdrawn from their Ethereum wallet(s)[17] as a result of MEWKit.\n\n[15. https://www.reddit.com/r/MyEtherWallet/comments/8ek0jj/think i got scammedphishedhacked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MyEtherWallet/comments/8ek0jj/think_i_got_scammedphishedhacked/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe MEWKit page itself, like any properly build phishing page, looked exactly like the normal\nMyEtherWallet website:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe setup we saw for this attack, however, was different from what we have seen on normal MEWKit\ninstalls. If we look at the document object model (DOM), we see the normal MEWKit scripts (top, MEWKit,\nbottom MyEtherWallet.com):\n\nThe first thing to notice is that the scripts have not been obfuscated in any way—in fact, they seem to\nbe right from the author. If we look at wallet.js, which contains the configuration for logging and the\nbackend location, we get this:\n\nThe first variable sets the reporting backend to http://46.161.42.42/pind/ and the second variable\ndisables logging. If we move to sm.js, we can already see some changes at the top of the script where\nadditional variables were added:\n\n\n-----\n\nAs explained in the functionality of MEWKit above, the eth_recipient variable has to do with the\nrecipient of the stolen funds. If we check the get_state_address function, which normally sets the\n(single) eth_recipient variable value, we see the author has been playing around with implementing\nmultiple recipient addresses. The code still contains commented sections so it turns out the author\nsimply forgot to comment out the added eth_recipient_n variables, as they aren’t used. They were\nexperimenting it seems:\n\nThe function also contains a commented out console.log call, which would log a message to the\nconsole. This gives us more certainty that the author was testing with new functionality for the scripts for\nthis attack\n\nGoing through the script, we can find more evidence of experimentation in the form of comments written\nin Russian. We’ve translated all the comments, and based on the wording used, they were likely written\nby a native Russian speaker who is familiar with financial terms (more information on that below). We’ll\ngo through the comments one by one. In the cases where they don’t translate directly to English, we will\nexplain them.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe above text ‘проверяем доступность секции с траншем’ mentions checking the availability\nof ‘траншем’ in a section, which, in our eyes, is an interesting use of words and a significant finding to\nmention. The comment is in regards to the fact that the code below will go through the wallet addresses\nto get a total balance of the funds in the wallet. The word ‘траншем’ is Russian for ‘tranche,’ which comes\nfrom a French word denoting a section or portion of a transaction.\n\nThe first comment, ‘получаем баланс,’ translates to ‘get balance.’ The second comment, ‘баланс,’ is the\nword ‘balance’. The third comment, ‘стоп работ,а’ means ‘stop work,’ which makes sense because it\ncomes right after the balance retrieved shows as 0, meaning the ATS has no funds to transfer and can\nstop working.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first comment, ‘поставить кошелек получателя,’ translates to ‘set the wallet of the\n```\nrecipient,’ which is related to the function that sets the receiving wallet of the transaction to which\n\n```\nto transfer funds from the phished victim’s wallet. The second comment, ‘отправить весь баланс в\nэмаунт,’ translates to ‘send the entire balance to the amount.’ The last word in this sentence, ‘эмаунт’’ is a\nnon-Russian word spelled in Cyrillic.\n\nFor us, the presence of these comments means the author is a native Russian speaker with at least some\nknowledge of financial terms.\n\n##### Conclusions\n\nA lot has already been published about the exact details of this specific attack since the incident, but we\ndecided to have a more in-depth look into exactly what happened and dig additional insights linking it to\nMEWKit. The Amazon Route 53 Hijack had a single target. Although the scope of this attack was relatively\nsmall, its footprint could have been much, much larger.\n\nThe internet was created a few decades ago, and not all its building blocks have aged well—BGP and\nDNS continue to be a problematic but essential piece of our global internet. As with most cybersecurity\nproblems, there are solutions to combat these kinds of attacks, but their effectiveness depends on\neveryone in the chain tightening up their security and deploying solutions.\n\nAs we have shown, a lot more has been going on around MyEtherWallet. In this report, we tried to give a\ncomprehensive overview of what we’ve observed. In case anyone would like to reach out to collaborate,\nget raw data, or has a question, feel free to reach out to yonathan@riskiq.net.\n\n#### IDN Phishery\n\nOne thing to note with almost all MEWKit instances is that the attackers make use of Internationalized\nDomain Names (IDNs). IDN attacks aren't new at all, but sadly, they seem to be extremely effective in\ncampaigns leveraging MEWKit.\n\nBrowsers are catching up with this problem, and both Firefox and Chrome have implemented a very\nsimple algorithm that checks if all characters in a domain name belong to the same language. If not, they\ndisplay the IDNA notation starting with 'xn--.' This filter does prevent a lot of the attacks with MEWKit, as\n\n\n-----\n\nthe actors are using special language characters from Cyrillic, Greek, Armenian, and Hebrew to swap out\nletters with their special character variant.\n\nThere are, of course, those that still slip through these filters, and we’d like to urge caution to any people\ntrading on MyEtherWallet. Please keep a very close eye on which URL you open, and, preferably, have a\nbookmarked page for MyEtherWallet or type the domain name yourself. Do not use links provided from\nothers from emails, social media, etc.\n\n#### Out of the Ordinary\n\nMost of the domains and hosts used in MEWKit campaigns use a very specific format for their\nMyEtherWallet impersonation. However one host running MEWKit just didn’t fit in, and upon close\ninspection was running some curious scripts. The host in question is tikkiepayment.info, which was hosted\nat 31.31.196.186. On April 9th, a MEWKit instance was hosted at myyetherwallett.com/myether/, which\nloaded its MEWKit scripts from:\n\n `myyetherwallett.com/myether/js/wallet.js`\n\n `myyetherwallett.com/myether/js/sm.js`\n\nThe backend location was set to https://tikkiepayment.info/showpanel/ in the wallet.js script, which\nstill contained comments explaining the variables:\n\nWe’ve also seen other paths for the MEWKit backend on the same host:\n\n `https://tikkiepayment.info/pp/`\n\n `https://tikkiepayment.info/mycryptopanel/`\n\n `https://tikkiepayment.info/showpanel/`\n\nIf we take a look at the tikkiepayment.info host, we find something curious we had never seen on\nany other MEWKit instance: it was also running web-based tooling for the actor that was unrelated to\n[MEWKit. On https://tikkiepayment.info/pv/, a tool was hosted that allowed the actor to check Ethereum](https://tikkiepayment.info/pv/)\nkeys in bulk using the MyEtherWallet API:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile there usually isn t honor among thieves in cybercrime, this tool was a stripped down version of\nMyEtherWallet that others could use, which checked whether an account was valid and had any balance.\nBased on the tooling present on the server and the fact that it was the first host we ever observed\nMEWKit on, we think this host was set up by the creator of MEWKit. Additionally, based on registration\ninformation shown in the IOC section at the bottom of this report, the domain was registered a month\nbefore any MEWKit hosts were set up.\n\n#### More than just Ethereum\n\nWhile we cannot say the MEWKit operation is a single actor with certainty, we did find some interesting\nlinks between a MEWKit instance and phishing pages for other cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency\nexchanges.\n\nOn April 17th, a MEWKit instance was live on www.xn--myetherwalle-occ.com, which had its MEWKit\nscripts loaded from the following locations:\n\n cdnsfiles.com/js/wallet.js\n\n cdnsfiles.com/js/sm.js\n\nThe backend location was hosted at www.xn--myetherwalle-occ.com/adm/ but another instance of\nMEWKit was hosted on cdnsfiles.com directly, with its resources loaded from the same location as\nmentioned above and the backend location set to cdnsfiles.com/adm/.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that we’ve seen another website load resources from cdnsfiles.com, which is not a\nMEWKit instance but rather a phishing page for blockchain.info. The page itself was a normal phishing\nwebsite and didn’t include the ATS component MEWKit has—it just harvested the login credentials. What\nis interesting, however, is where it loads its resources from:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt was using cdnfiles.com for its phishing resources at the same time as it was used for MEWKit, which\ntells us the actors behind MEWKit have a very broad portfolio of phishing pages. If we look at the host\nfor phishing page, 185.207.205.16, we find another large set of phishing domains mostly focusing on\n```\nblockchain.info. However, there is also an IDN phish for Coinbase:\n\n```\n[Source: https://community.riskiq.com/search/185.207.205.16](https://community.riskiq.com/search/185.207.205.16)\n\nAbove, the domain names in RiskIQ PassiveTotal have not been added to the IOC section of this report\nbecause this report focuses solely on MEWKit. However, pivoting on the mentioned IP address—in the\nIOC section of this report because it hosted MEWKit—will provide enough data points to start a separate\ninvestigation.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusions\n\nMEWKit has been in active use since the beginning of this year, and while we haven’t seen it before 2018,\nit may have been active in the wild in a different capacity or form. The activity leading up to the BGP\nhijacking Amazon Route 53 shows the persistence of this actor and the campaigns it drives. With close\nto a hundred domains set up in a period of a few months, the associated costs of carrying out its attacks\npoint to MEWKit being exceptionally successful and, although simple in technical sophistication, efficient\nat stealing Ethereum.\n\nAs we explained in the technical analysis of MEWKit, we cannot estimate the attacker's income because\nwe cannot know how many wallets and addresses the attacker controls due to the way MyEtherWallet\nis set up—with addresses handed out on a per-victim basis. The architecture of the blockchain and,\nspecifically, Ethereum does allow everyone to get insight into wallet address balances through the\npublic ledger, but it also maintains total anonymity for the owners. Until the actor is apprehended or law\nenforcement provides insights into the exact addresses used in the MEWKit attacks, we will never know\nits precise haul.\n\nWe do know that various wallets have been published on social media and forums that ostensibly amount\nto many millions of dollars in revenue, but we have no way to link this to MEWKit with high confidence.\nHowever, with the number of domains registered, the servers maintained, and the high levels of activity,\nwe can surmise that the income from this attack must be substantial enough to not only sustain the\noperation but also make a profit.\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\nThe following section contains all IOCs we have observed that are directly attributable to the MEWKit and\n[its activities. These IOCs are also available in a PassiveTotal project for automation: https://community.](https://community.riskiq.com/projects/27cddf0e-a912-1ca7-5a9e-6182d3674045)\n[riskiq.com/projects/27cddf0e-a912-1ca7-5a9e-6182d3674045](https://community.riskiq.com/projects/27cddf0e-a912-1ca7-5a9e-6182d3674045)\n\nThe following IP addresses have been observed running MEWKit instances and are associated with one or\nmore of the domains listed in the table below this list.\n\n `185.145.131.134`\n\n `185.207.205.16`\n\n `185.207.205.25`\n\n `185.61.137.36`\n\n `198.50.209.83`\n\n `31.31.196.186`\n\n `37.1.203.209`\n\n `46.161.42.42`\n\n `5.45.69.74`\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following is an exhaustive list of domain names with the date of registration and email address used\nfor registration. If the email address is missing, it means the field was filled by a privacy service or registrar\ndefault. The registration dates closely coincide when the domains that were set up with MEWKit and used\nin campaigns.\n\n|Domain|Registration Date|WHOIS Registrant
