    "plain_text": "# DUQU 2.0: \n\n FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\n\n-----\n\n# Introduction\n\nIn early spring this year, Kaspersky Lab detected a cyber-intrusion affecting several of its\ninternal systems. We immediately launched an intensive investigation, which led to the\ndiscovery of a carefully planned cyber-espionage attack carried out by the same group that\n[was behind the infamous 2011 Duqu APT. We believe this is a nation-state sponsored](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/32463/duqu-faq-33/)\ncampaign.\n\nDuqu is a sophisticated malware platform discovered by CrySyS Lab, and investigated by\nKaspersky Lab in 2011. Its main purpose was to act as a backdoor into the system and\nfacilitate the theft of private information. In 2011 Duqu was detected in Hungary, Austria,\nIndonesia, the UK, Sudan and Iran. There are clues that Duqu was used to spy on the Iran\nnuclear program and also to compromise Certificates Authorities to hijack digital certificates.\nThese certificates were used to sign malicious files to evade security solutions.\n\nKaspersky Lab believes the attackers were certain it was impossible to discover the\ncyberattack. They did everything possible to avoid exposure: the attack included some\nunique and earlier unseen features and almost didn’t leave any traces. The attack exploited\nzero-day vulnerabilities and after elevating privileges to domain administrator, the malware\nspread in the network through MSI files which are commonly used by system administrators\nto deploy software on remote Windows computers. The cyberattack didn’t create or modify\nany disk files or system settings, making detection almost impossible. The philosophy and\nway of thinking of the ‘Duqu 2.0’ group is a generation ahead of anything seen in the APT\nworld. But thanks to our technologies and top class researchers, we caught them.\n\nTo mitigate this threat, Kaspersky Lab is releasing Indicators of Compromise and would like\nto offer its assistance to all interested or affected organizations. Also, procedures for\nprotection from Duqu 2.0 have been added to the company’s products.\n\n[More details on the Duqu 2.0 malware can be found in the technical report.](https://securelist.com/blog/research/70504/the-mystery-of-duqu-2-0-a-sophisticated-cyberespionage-actor-returns/)\n\n\n## 2\n\n\n-----\n\nWho are the targets of this campaign?\n\nKaspersky Lab researchers discovered the company wasn’t the only target of this powerful threat\nactor. Other victims have been found in Western, Middle-Eastern and Asian countries. Most\n[notably, some of the new 2014-2015 infections are linked to the P5+1](https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/foreign-policy/iran-negotiations) events and venues\nrelated to the negotiations with Iran about a nuclear deal. The threat actor also launched a similar\nattack in relation to the 70[th] anniversary event of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.\n\nKaspersky Lab would like to reiterate that these are only preliminary results of its investigation.\nThere is no doubt that this attack had a much wider geographical reach and many more targets.\nBut judging from what the company already knows, Duqu 2.0 has been used to attack a complex\nrange of targets at the highest levels with similarly varied geo-political interests.\n\nWhat is the significance of this discovery?\n\nThe philosophy and way of thinking of the Duqu 2.0 group is a generation ahead of anything seen\n[in the APT world. Its level of sophistication surpasses even the Equation Group – supposedly the](https://securelist.com/blog/research/68750/equation-the-death-star-of-malware-galaxy/)\n‘crème de la crème’ in this sphere.\n\nThe Equation Group always used some form of ‘persistence, accepting a bigger risk of being\ndiscovered. The Duqu 2.0 malware platform was designed in a way that survives almost\nexclusively in the memory of infected systems, without need for persistence – it means the\nattackers are sure there is always a way for them to maintain an infection – even if the victim’s\nmachine is rebooted and the malware disappears from the memory.\n\nThat approach is much more sophisticated. It also demonstrates a different mentality: the Duqu\n2.0 threat actor was confident enough to create and manage an entire cyber-espionage operation\njust in memory – one that could survive within an entire network of compromised computers\nwithout relying on any persistence mechanism at all.\n\nIn addition, the Equation Group used the same encryption algorithm with the same specific\nfeatures in all their malware – starting with the Equation Vector in 1999 through to GrayFish in\n2013. With Duqu 2.0, every single encryption is different, with different algorithms for every case.\n\nThese reasons make Duqu 2.0 more advanced than any other APT group.\n\nWhat are the consequences of this cyberattack for Kaspersky Lab?\n\nKaspersky Lab performed an initial security audit and analysis of the attack. The analysis\nrevealed that the main goal of the attackers was to spy on Kaspersky Lab technologies, ongoing\nresearch and internal processes. The attackers were interested in Kaspersky Lab’s intellectual\nproperty and proprietary technologies used for discovering and analyzing APTs, and the data on\ncurrent investigations into advanced targeted attacks; they were especially interested in our\nproduct innovations, including Kaspersky Lab’s Secure Operating System, Kaspersky Security\nNetwork, Kaspersky Fraud Prevention and Anti-APT solutions. Besides intellectual property theft,\n\n\n## 3\n\n\n-----\n\nno additional indicators of malicious activity were detected. Also, no interference with processes\nor systems was detected.\n\nThe attackers were likely aware of the company’s reputation as one of the most advanced in\ndetecting and fighting complex APT attacks, and were attempting to find ways to make their\nfuture attacks go undetected.\n\nThe information accessed by the attackers is in no way critical to the operation of the company’s\nproducts. Armed with information about this attack Kaspersky Lab will continue to improve the\nperformance of its IT security solutions portfolio.\n\nWhat does this incident mean to Kaspersky Lab customers?\n\nKaspersky Lab is confident that its clients and partners are safe and that there is no impact on\nthe company’s products, technologies and services. The attackers’ main goal was not customers’\ndata, but access to Kaspersky Lab’s intellectual property and proprietary technologies used for\ndiscovering and analyzing APTs, and the data on current investigations into advanced targeted\nattacks.\n\nKaspersky Lab would like to assure its clients and partners that the company will continue to\nprotect against any cyberattack indiscriminately. Kaspersky Lab is committed to doing right by its\ncustomers and maintaining their full trust and confidence, and the company is confident that the\nsteps taken will address this incident while preventing a similar issue from occurring again.\n\nHow did you discover the attack?\n\nWe detected the attack in early spring of this year. We were able to discover it thanks to the\nexpertise of our researchers and our technologies: during a test, a prototype of an anti-APT\nsolution developed by Kaspersky Lab showed signs of a complex targeted attack on its corporate\nnetwork. After the attack was noticed an internal investigation was launched. A team of\nKaspersky Lab researchers, reverse engineers and malware analysts worked around the clock to\nanalyze this exceptional attack.\n\nWhat are the reasons to think that a nation-state is behind this attack?\n\nDeveloping and operating such a professional malware campaign is extremely expensive and\nrequires resources beyond those of everyday cybercriminals. The cost of developing and\nmaintaining such a malicious framework is colossal: we estimate it to be around $50 million.\nWhat is really remarkable here is that the entire malware platform relies heavily on zero-days. If\nthere is no zero-day to jump into kernel mode, the malware won’t work. That could mean that the\nattackers were pretty confident that should one vulnerability be patched they’d implement\nanother. Otherwise they wouldn’t have built a platform dependent entirely on zero-days.\n\n\n## 4\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Duqu 2.0 operation displays no objective of getting any financial profit from the use of the\nmalware.\n\nThe use of multiple zero-day exploits and sophisticated hacking techniques during the attack is\nanother indicator that it is a nation-state sponsored campaign.\n\nWhy do you think Kaspersky Lab was targeted alongside high-level government representatives?\n\nThe targeting of Kaspersky Lab represents a huge step for the attackers and is an indicator of\nhow quick the cyber-arms race is escalating. Back in 2011 and 2013, respectively, [[1]RSA](https://blogs.rsa.com/anatomy-of-an-attack/) and\n\n[2Bit9](https://blog.bit9.com/2013/02/08/bit9-and-our-customers-security/) were hacked by Chinese-speaking APT groups but these incidents were considered rare. In\ngeneral, an attacker risks a lot targeting a security company – because they may get caught and\nexposed. The exact reason why Kaspersky Lab was targeted is still not clear – although we\nbelieve the primary goal of the attack was to acquire information on Kaspersky Lab’s newest\ndefensive technologies.\n\nDoes this attack mean that there is no protection from government-grade malware?\n\nNo, it doesn’t. A conventional approach to protect endpoints may not help against professional\ngovernment-grade malware. We realized this some time ago, and started developing new\ntechnologies. Our Anti-APT solution is one such technology. We discovered Duqu 2.0 while testing\na prototype of our new anti-APT product.\n\nAPT attacks differ very much from the point of view of the skills of the threat actor and the\nresources available to launch sophisticated attacks. Unfortunately, some of these campaigns –\nlike Stuxnet, Flame and Equation – can go undetected for several years. However, IT security\ncompanies will eventually discover these campaigns as there is no such thing as perfect code\n(including malicious).\n\nIs there any reputational damage to Kaspersky Lab?\n\nIt is still believed that disclosing a cyber-incident leads to reputation damage first and foremost.\nIn reality this is a false and dangerous conclusion and the reality is that any company can fall\nvictim to sophisticated targeted attacks. Why is it dangerous? Because concealing such facts\nhelps cybercriminals and government-backed hacker groups in that their malicious activities are\nnot publicly disclosed and discussed and the data on how to prevent their attacks is not widely\ndistributed.\n\nBy communicating the news about the incident and publishing our technical report on Duqu 2.0\nwe intend to send a message to other companies and encourage them to disclose details of\ncyberattacks on their networks. Our case shows that even a leading security company can be a\ntarget of a well-resourced APT threat actor. It is important to remember that national intelligence\n\n1 [https://blogs.rsa.com/anatomy-of-an-attack/](https://blogs.rsa.com/anatomy-of-an-attack/)\n2 [https://blog.bit9.com/2013/02/08/bit9-and-our-customers-security/](https://blog.bit9.com/2013/02/08/bit9-and-our-customers-security/)\n\n\n## 5\n\n\n-----\n\nservices can have multi-billion-dollar budgets and hundreds of thousands of employees. We can\nfight back by being open, transparent and by making such malicious activities public.\n\nKaspersky Lab has consistently advocated responsible behavior regarding disclosure of\ncyberattacks. We’re confident that concealing security incidents leads to a situation in which less\ninformation leads to less awareness, and ultimately to weaker protection. We believe that every\nattacked company should disclose security incidents, which would also allow other companies to\nmake their defenses stronger.\n\nIs this the first time that a nation-state group has targeted an IT security company?\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the first nation-state linked attack against a security vendor. Previous\nattacks against RSA Security and Bit9 were linked to nation-state attackers. Threat actors appear\nto compromise IT Security companies as ‘utilitarian targets’, which allow them to improve their\ncyber capabilities.\n\nWhat was done to prevent this kind of attack in future?\n\nWe are taking multiple aggressive measures to further improve our IT infrastructure to protect our\nassets and our customers. We are trying to make it as difficult and expensive as possible for\nanyone to target us, from all points of view.\n\nWhat mitigation strategy can you recommend?\n\nWe recommend applying the following four simple but very effective measures:\n\n1. Make sure you have installed Kaspersky products on all the computers at your location,\n\nincluding servers, proxies, and any other type of computer you may have.\n\n2. Update Windows to the latest version using Microsoft Windows Update. Make sure you\n\ninstall Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday update from June 9, 2015.\n\n3. Reboot all computers at once – for instance simulating a power failure. It is very important\n\nto reboot everything at the same time, otherwise the malware might survive on a machine\nand re-infect the others.\n\n4. Change all passwords.\n\nThe following general strategies will help mitigate attacks with Duqu 2.0:\n\n  - Perform regular updates and rebooting of all machines in the network, including domain\ncontrollers. Rebooting removes the active malware from memory.\n\n  - Make sure all your servers run x64 (64-bit) Windows. This forces the attackers to use\nsigned drivers for persistence mechanisms.\n\n\n## 6\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Change passwords regularly (every 1-2 months) and use strong passphrases that are\nlonger than 20 characters. Disable old-style LM hashes.\n\n[For more advanced users, we are providing Yara rules and a tool that can help identify infections](https://securelist.com/blog/research/70504/the-mystery-of-duqu-2-0-a-sophisticated-cyberespionage-actor-returns/)\nin memory dumps and event logs.\n\n[In addition to these, we have published an article on Securelist “How to mitigate 85% of all](https://securelist.com/blog/software/69887/how-to-mitigate-85-of-threats-with-only-four-strategies/)\n[targeted attacks using 4 simple strategies”. We recommend reading it and implementing the](https://securelist.com/blog/software/69887/how-to-mitigate-85-of-threats-with-only-four-strategies/)\nsuggestions in your network.\n\nWho should I contact in case I/my company became a victim of the Duqu 2.0 campaign?\n\nIf you have any questions or information to share about this threat actor, please contact\nintelreports@kaspersky.com. Thank you.\n\n\n## 7\n\n\n-----",
