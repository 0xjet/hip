Netwalker became\nwidely recognized in March 2020, after intrusions on an Australian transportation\nand logistics company and a U.S. public health organization. Cyber actors using\nNetwalker have since taken advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to compromise\nan increasing number of unsuspecting victims.\n\n#### Technical Details\n\nFollowing a successful intrusion, Netwalker encrypts all connected Windows-based\ndevices and data, rendering critical files, databases, and applications inaccessible\nto users. When executed, Netwalker deploys an embedded configuration that\nincludes a ransom note, ransom note file names, and various configuration\noptions.\n\nIn March 2020, actors using Netwalker began exploiting COVID-19 fears by luring\nunsuspecting victims with pandemic related phishing e-mails. Specifically,\nNetwalker spread through a Visual Basic Scripting (VBS) script attached to COVID19 phishing e-mails that executed the payload once opened.\n\nIn April 2020, actors using Netwalker began gaining unauthorized access to victim\nnetworks by exploiting unpatched Virtual Private Network (VPN) appliances,\nvulnerable user interface components in web applications, or weak passwords\nused for Remote Desktop Protocol connections.\n\n\nThe following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or\nwarranties, for potential use at the sole discretion of recipients in order to protect\n\n\n-----\n\nTwo of the most common vulnerabilities exploited by actors using Netwalker are Pulse Secure VPN (CVE-201911510) and Telerik UI (CVE-2019-18935). Once an actor has infiltrated a network with Netwalker, a combination of\nmalicious programs may be executed to harvest administrator credentials, steal valuable data, and encrypt user\nfiles. In order to encrypt the user files on a victim network, the actors typically launch a malicious PowerShell script\nembedded with the Netwalker ransomware executable.\n\nActors using Netwalker have previously uploaded stolen data to the cloud storage and file sharing service,\nMEGA.NZ (MEGA), by uploading the data through the MEGA website or by installing the MEGA client application\ndirectly on a victim’s computer. In June 2020, actors transitioned from uploading and releasing stolen data on\nMEGA to uploading the stolen data to another file sharing service: website.dropmefiles.com.\n\n**Confirmed Indicators**\nEmail Addresses:\n```\n 2hamlampampom@cock.li galgalgalgalk@tutanota.com johprohnpo@cock.li\n cancandecan@tutanota.com galgalgalgawk@tutanota.com kavariusing@tutanota.com\n eeaammzzyy@cock.li hamlampampom@cock.li kazkavkovkiz@cock.li\n eeaammzzyy@tuta.io hariliuios@tutanota.com kkeessnnkkaa@cock.li\n eeeooppaaaxxx@tuta.io hhaaxxhhaaxx@tuta.io kkkwwwsvvv@cock.li\n knoocknoo@cock.li pabpabtab@tuta.io sevenoneone@cock.li\n kokbiglock@cock.li repairdb@seznam.cz sevenonone@cock.li\n kokoklock@cock.li rrrkkktttaaa@cock.li\n\n```\nMD5 Hashes:\n```\n 258ed03a6e4d9012f8102c635a5e3dcd 73de5babf166f28dc81d6c2faa369379\n 3d6203df53fcaa16d71add5f47bdd060 7a1288c7be386c99fad964dbd068964f\n 5b80cbbdcb697c0b8ec26e6cf0ff305c 993b73d6490bc5a7e23e02210b317247\n 27304b246c7d5b4e149124d5f93c5b01 8fbc17d634009cb1ce261b5b3b2f2ecb\n 59881abed688ceba3d67c2ff22076ad8 6a64553da499c1d9a64d97f4de3882f5\n\n```\nSHA-256 Hashes:\n```\n 8f834966a06f34682b78e1644c47ab488b394b80109ddea39fc9a29ed0d56a0c\n 58e923ff158fb5aecd293b7a0e0d305296110b83c6e270786edcc4fea1c8404c\n 8639825230d5504fd8126ed55b2d7aeb72944ffe17e762801aab8d4f8f880160\n 9f9027b5db5c408ee43ef2a7c7dd1aecbdb244ef6b16d9aafb599e8c40368967\n ad8d379a4431cabd079a1c34add903451e11f06652fe28d3f3edb6c469c43893\n de04d2402154f676f757cf1380671f396f3fc9f7dbb683d9461edd2718c4e09d\n\n```\nSHA1 Hashes:\n```\n 655352e00c7e478c3fed38bc6f407982dec3768d a3bc2a30318f9bd2b51cb57e2022996e7f15c69e\n 6fd314af34409e945504e166eb8cd88127c1070e e393a9ecf0d0a8babaa5efcc34f10577aff1cad1\n\n```\nMalicious Files and Executables:\n\n|Confirmed Indicators|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Email Addresses:|||\n|2hamlampampom@cock.li|galgalgalgalk@tutanota.com|johprohnpo@cock.li|\n|cancandecan@tutanota.com|galgalgalgawk@tutanota.com|kavariusing@tutanota.com|\n|eeaammzzyy@cock.li|hamlampampom@cock.li|kazkavkovkiz@cock.li|\n|eeaammzzyy@tuta.io|hariliuios@tutanota.com|kkeessnnkkaa@cock.li|\n|eeeooppaaaxxx@tuta.io|hhaaxxhhaaxx@tuta.io|kkkwwwsvvv@cock.li|\n|knoocknoo@cock.li|pabpabtab@tuta.io|sevenoneone@cock.li|\n|kokbiglock@cock.li|repairdb@seznam.cz|sevenonone@cock.li|\n|kokoklock@cock.li|rrrkkktttaaa@cock.li||\n\n|MD5 Hashes:|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|258ed03a6e4d9012f8102c635a5e3dcd|73de5babf166f28dc81d6c2faa369379|\n|3d6203df53fcaa16d71add5f47bdd060|7a1288c7be386c99fad964dbd068964f|\n|5b80cbbdcb697c0b8ec26e6cf0ff305c|993b73d6490bc5a7e23e02210b317247|\n|27304b246c7d5b4e149124d5f93c5b01|8fbc17d634009cb1ce261b5b3b2f2ecb|\n|59881abed688ceba3d67c2ff22076ad8|6a64553da499c1d9a64d97f4de3882f5|\n\n|SHA1 Hashes:|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|655352e00c7e478c3fed38bc6f407982dec3768d|a3bc2a30318f9bd2b51cb57e2022996e7f15c69e|\n|6fd314af34409e945504e166eb8cd88127c1070e|e393a9ecf0d0a8babaa5efcc34f10577aff1cad1|\n|Malicious Files and Executables:||\n\n\nTwo of the most common vulnerabilities exploited by actors using Netwalker are Pulse Secure VPN (CVE-2019-\n11510) and Telerik UI (CVE-2019-18935).

Paying a ransom may embolden adversaries to\ntarget additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware,\nand/or may fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered.\nHowever, the FBI understands that when businesses are faced with an inability to function, executives will evaluate\nall options to protect their shareholders, employees, and customers. Regardless of whether you or your\norganization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local field\noffice or the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Doing so provides investigators with the critical\ninformation they need to track ransomware attackers, hold them accountable under U.S. law, and prevent future\nattacks.\n\n#### Recommended Mitigations\n\n  - Back-up critical data offline.\n\n  - Ensure copies of critical data are in the cloud or on an external hard drive or storage device.\n\n  - Secure your back-ups and ensure data is not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where\n\nthe data resides.\n\n  - Install and regularly update anti-virus or anti-malware software on all hosts.\n\n  - Only use secure networks and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks. Consider installing and using a VPN.\n\n  - Use two-factor authentication with strong passwords.\n\n  - Keep computers, devices, and applications patched and up-to-date.\n\n#### Reporting Notice\n\nThe FBI encourages recipients of this document to report information concerning suspicious or criminal activity to\ntheir local FBI field office or the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Field office contacts can be identified\n[at https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices. Contact IC3 at www.ic3.gov. When available, each report](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices)\nsubmitted should include the date, time, location, type of activity, number of people, and type of equipment used\nfor the activity, the name of the submitting company or organization, and a designated point of contact.\n\n#### Administrative Note\n\n|qeSw.exe|pw.exe|Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1|mimikatzN.exe|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|CORONAVIRUS_COVID-19.vbs|wce.exe|Invoke-mimikittenz.ps1|mimikatz.exe|\n|t.exe|pwdump7.exe|dl.exe|rz.ps1|\n\n```\n   qeSw.exe pw.exe Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 mimikatzN.exe\n   CORONAVIRUS_COVID-19.vbs wce.exe Invoke-mimikittenz.ps1 mimikatz.exe\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThis product is marked TLP:WHITE.
