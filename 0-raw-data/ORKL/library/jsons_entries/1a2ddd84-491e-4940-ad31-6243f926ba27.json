    "plain_text": "# NOBELIUM targeting delegated administrative privileges to facilitate broader attacks\n\n**microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/10/25/nobelium-targeting-delegated-administrative-privileges-to-facilitate-broader-**\nattacks/\n\nOctober 25, 2021\n\n[The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has detected nation-state activity](https://aka.ms/nobelium_oct2021_moti)\nassociated with the threat actor tracked as NOBELIUM, attempting to gain access to\ndownstream customers of multiple cloud service providers (CSP), managed service\nproviders (MSP), and other IT services organizations (referred to as “service providers” for\nthe rest of this blog) that have been granted administrative or privileged access by other\norganizations. The targeted activity has been observed against organizations based in the\nUnited States and across Europe since May 2021. MSTIC assesses that NOBELIUM has\nlaunched a campaign against these organizations to exploit existing technical trust\nrelationships between the provider organizations and the governments, think tanks, and\nother companies they serve. NOBELIUM is the same actor behind the SolarWinds\ncompromise in 2020, and this latest activity shares the hallmarks of the actor’s compromiseone-to-compromise-many approach. Microsoft has notified known victims of these activities\n\n\n-----\n\nthrough our nation-state notification process and worked with them and other industry\npartners to expand our investigation, resulting in new insights and disruption of the threat\nactor throughout stages of this campaign.\n\nMicrosoft has observed NOBELIUM targeting privileged accounts of service providers to\nmove laterally in cloud environments, leveraging the trusted relationships to gain access to\ndownstream customers and enable further attacks or access targeted systems. These\nattacks are not the result of a product security vulnerability but rather a continuation of\nNOBELIUM’s use of a diverse and dynamic toolkit that includes sophisticated malware,\npassword sprays, supply chain attacks, token theft, API abuse, and spear phishing to\ncompromise user accounts and leverage the access of those accounts. These attacks have\nhighlighted the need for administrators to adopt strict account security practices and take\nadditional measures to secure their environments.\n\nIn the observed supply chain attacks, downstream customers of service providers and other\norganizations are also being targeted by NOBELIUM. In these provider/customer\nrelationships, customers delegate administrative rights to the provider that enable the\nprovider to manage the customer’s tenants as if they were an administrator within the\ncustomer’s organization. By stealing credentials and compromising accounts at the service\nprovider level, NOBELIUM can take advantage of several potential vectors, including but not\nlimited to delegated administrative privileges (DAP), and then leverage that access to extend\ndownstream attacks through trusted channels like externally facing VPNs or unique providercustomer solutions that enable network access. To reduce the potential impact of this\nNOBELIUM activity, Microsoft encourages all of our partners and customers to immediately\nreview the guidance below and implement risk mitigations, harden environments, and\ninvestigate suspicious behaviors that match the tactics described in this blog. MSTIC\ncontinues to observe, monitor, and notify affected customers and partners through our\nnation-state notification process. Microsoft Detection and Response Team (DART) and\nMicrosoft Threat Experts have also engaged directly with affected customers to assist with\nincident response and drive better detection and guidance around this activity.\n\n## Post-exploitation patterns against downstream targets\n\nA key trait of NOBELIUM’s ongoing activity over the last year has been the abuse of indirect\npaths and trust relationships to target and gain access to victims of interest for intelligence\ngain. In the most recent campaign, this has manifested in a compromise-one-to-compromisemany approach—exploiting the service providers’ trust chain to gain broad access to multiple\ncustomer tenants for subsequent attacks. NOBELIUM leverages established standard\nbusiness practices, to target downstream customers across multiple managed tenants.\nThese delegated administrative privileges are often neither audited for approved use nor\ndisabled by a service provider or downstream customer once use has ended, leaving them\n\n\n-----\n\nactive until removed by the administrators. If NOBELIUM has compromised the accounts tied\nto delegated administrative privileges through other credential-stealing attacks, that access\ngrants actors like NOBELIUM persistence for ongoing campaigns.\n\nIn one example intrusion chain observed by MSTIC during this campaign, the actor was\nobserved chaining together artifacts and access across four distinct providers to reach their\nend target. The example demonstrates the breadth of techniques that the actor leverages to\nexploit and abuse trust relationships to accomplish their objective.\n\n_Figure 1: Example intrusion conducted by NOBELIUM demonstrating nested access across_\n_variety of methods._\n\nMicrosoft assesses that organizations, such as cloud service providers and other technology\norganizations who manage services on behalf of downstream customers, will be of continued\ninterest to persistent threat actors and are at risk for targeting via a variety of methods, from\ncredential access to targeted social engineering via legitimate business processes and\nprocedures. For additional information on how to identify and triage delegated administrative\nprivileges, see the mitigations and recommendations below.\n\n## Mitigation and remediation\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft recommends that cloud service providers, other technology organizations with\nelevated privileges for customer systems, and all downstream customers of these\norganizations review and implement the following actions to help mitigate and remediate the\nrecent NOBELIUM activity.\n\n### If you are a cloud service provider or an organization who relies on elevated privileges\n\n**1. Verify and monitor compliance with Microsoft Partner Center security requirements**\n\nAll Microsoft partners should review and verify overall compliance status with the partner\nsecurity requirements through the Microsoft Partner Center. Microsoft recommends the\nfollowing:\n\n1. Ensure multifactor authentication (MFA) is in use and conditional access policies\n\n**are enforced: All Microsoft partners are required to use MFA to access Partner Center**\nand for cross-tenant access to customer tenants in Microsoft commercial clouds.\n[Partners are advised to check their security compliance in Partner Center and monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/partner-security-compliance#multi-factor-authentication-mfa-report)\nif any user logins or API calls are not compliant with MFA enforcement. Partners should\n[stay compliant at all times.](https://partner.microsoft.com/commerce/security/compliance)\n2. Adopt the Secure Application Model Framework: All partners integrating with\n\n[Partner Center APIs must adopt the Secure Application Model framework for any app](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/develop/enable-secure-app-model)\nand user auth model applications.\n3. Check the Partner Center Activity Logs: partners are advised to regularly check the\n\n[“Activity Log” in Partner Center to monitor any user activities, including high privileged](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/commerce2/auditrecords/list)\nuser creations, high privileged user role assignment, etc. Partners can also use Partner\nCenter Activity Log APIs to create a custom security dashboard on key user activities in\nPartner Center to proactively detect suspicious activities.\n\n**2. Remove delegated administrative privileges (DAP) connection when not in use**\n\nTo improve security, Microsoft recommends that partners remove delegated administrative\nprivileges that are no longer in use. Starting in November, a [new reporting tool will be](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/announcements/2021-september#11)\navailable that identifies and displays all active delegated administrative privilege connections\nand will help organizations to discover unused delegated administrative privileges\nconnections. This tool will provide reporting that captures how partner agents are accessing\ncustomer tenants through those privileges and will allow partners to remove the connection\nwhen not in use.\n\n\n-----\n\n1. We are offering service providers a **free two year subscription of Azure Active**\n\n**Directory Premium Plan 2 to further help them manage and get reports on access**\nprivileges. Registered partners can log onto Partner Center to take advantage of this\noffer. Azure AD Premium Plan 2 provides extended access to sign-in logs and premium\nfeatures such as Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and risk-based\nConditional Access capabilities to strengthen security controls.\n\n**3. Conduct a thorough investigation and comprehensive response.**\n\nCarry out additional investigations if you think you might have been affected to determine the\nfull scope of compromised users/assets. Microsoft recommends the following:\n\n1. Review the **[Azure AD Security Operations Guide to audit or establish your](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/security-operations-introduction)**\n\n**security operations. If you are a cloud service provider or an organization that relies**\non elevated privileges, you need to assess the security implications in your network\nand its connectivity for your customers. In particular, review authentications that are\nassociated with Azure AD configuration changes using the Microsoft 365 compliance\n[center (formerly in the Exchange admin center) or Azure AD admin logs.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs)\n2. Adequate log retention procedures for cloud-based resources are critical to\n\n**effectively identify, respond to, and remediate malicious activity. Cloud service**\nproviders and other technology organizations often configure individual subscriptions to\nmeet specific customer requirements. These configurations might not include security\ncontrols that enable full accountability to administrative actions should an incident\noccur. We encourage all organizations to become familiar with logs made available\nwithin your subscription and routinely evaluate them for adequacy and anomalies.\n3. General [Incident response playbooks for Phishing and Password spray are available in](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/compass/incident-response-playbooks)\n\nMicrosoft Security Best Practices.\n\n### If you are a downstream customer\n\n**1. Review, audit, and minimize access privileges and delegated permissions**\n\nIt is important to consider and implement a least-privilege approach. Microsoft recommends\n[prioritizing a thorough review and audit of partner relationships to minimize any unnecessary](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/commerce/manage-partners?view=o365-worldwide)\npermissions between your organization and upstream providers. Microsoft recommends\nimmediately removing access for any partner relationships that look unfamiliar or have not\nyet been audited.\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Review, harden, and monitor all tenant administrator accounts: All organizations\n\nshould thoroughly review all tenant admin users, including those associated with\n[Administer On Behalf Of (AOBO) in Azure subscriptions and verify the authenticity of](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-plan-manage)\nthe users and activity. We strongly encourage the use of strong authentication for all\ntenant administrators, review of devices registered for use with MFA, and minimize the\nuse of standing high-privilege access. Continue to reinspect all active tenant admin\nusers accounts and check audit logs on a regular basis to verify that high-privilege user\naccess is not granted or delegated to admin users who do not require these to do their\njob.\n2. Review service provider permissions access from B2B and local accounts: In\n\naddition to using the delegated administrative privilege capabilities, some cloud service\nproviders use business-to-business (B2B) accounts or local administrator accounts in\ncustomer tenants. We recommend that you identify whether your cloud service\nproviders use these, and if so, ensure those accounts are well-governed, and have\nleast-privilege access in your tenant. Microsoft recommends against the use of\n[“shared” administrator accounts. Review the detailed guidance on how to review](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/external-identities/auditing-and-reporting)\npermissions for B2B accounts.\n\n**2. Verify multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled and enforce conditional access**\n**policies**\n\nMFA is the best baseline security hygiene method to protect against threats. Follow the\n[detailed guidance on setting up multifactor authentication in Microsoft 365, as well as the](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication)\n[guidance on deploying and configuring conditional access policies in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/plan-conditional-access)\n(Azure AD).\n\n**3. Review and audit logs and configurations**\n\n1. Review and audit Azure AD sign-ins and configuration changes: Authentications of\n\n[this nature are audited and available to customers through the Azure AD sign in logs,](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins)\n[Azure AD audit logs, and the](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs) [Microsoft 365 compliance center (formerly in the](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/security-and-compliance/exchange-auditing-reports/search-role-group-changes)\nExchange Admin Center). We recently added the capability to see sign-ins by partners\nwho have delegated admin permissions. You can see a filtered view of these sign-ins\n[by navigating to the sign-in logs in the Azure AD admin portal, and adding a filter](https://aad.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/SignIns)\n‘Cross-tenant access type: Service provider’ on the ‘User-sign ins (non-interactive)’ tab.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Review Existing Log Availability and Retention Strategies: Investigating activities\n\nconducted by malicious actors places a large emphasis on having adequate log\nretention procedures for cloud-based resources including Office 365. Various\nsubscription levels have individualized log availability and retention policies which are\nimportant to understand prior to forming an incident response procedure.\n\nWe encourage all organizations to become familiar with logs made available within your\nsubscription and routinely evaluate them for adequacy and anomalies. For organizations\nrelying on a third-party organization, work with them to understand their logging strategy for\nall administrative actions and establish a process should logs need to be made available\nduring an incident.\n\n## Observed behaviors and TTPs\n\nUnique indicators (e.g., specific IPs, domains, hashes) have limited value in detecting global\nNOBELIUM activity because the indicators are mostly compartmented by campaign and\nspecific to the targeted organization. They also regularly obfuscate their attack by shifting\ninfrastructure and maintain very tight operational security around their campaigns. Despite\nthis, the following behaviors and characteristics are common to NOBELIUM intrusions and\nshould be reviewed closely during investigations to help determine if an organization has\nbeen affected:\n\nNOBELIUM leverages “anonymous” infrastructure, which may include low reputation\nproxy services, cloud hosting services, and TOR, to authenticate to victims\nNOBELIUM has been observed leveraging scripted capabilities, including but not\n[limited to RoadTools or](https://github.com/dirkjanm/ROADtools) [AADInternals, to conduct enumeration of Azure AD, which can](https://github.com/Gerenios/AADInternals)\nresult in authentication with user agents of scripting environments\nNOBELIUM has been observed authenticating to accounts from anomalous locations\nthat might trigger impossible travel analytics or fail to pass deployed conditional access\npolicies.\nNOBELIUM has been observed modifying Azure AD to enable long-term persistence\nand access to sensitive information. This can include the creation of users, consent of\nAzure AD applications, granting of roles to users and applications, creation of\nadditional service principal credentials, and more. More information at\n[https://aka.ms/nobelium.](https://aka.ms/nobelium)\nIn one incident, MSTIC observed the use of Azure RunCommand, paired with Azure\nadmin-on-behalf-of (AOBO), as a technique to gain access to virtual machines and shift\naccess from cloud to on-premise.\nNOBELIUM has demonstrated an ongoing interest in targeting privileged users,\nincluding Global Administrators. Security of at-risk organizations is greatly enhanced by\nprioritizing events that are detected on privileged accounts.\n\n\n-----\n\nNOBELIUM is frequently observed conducting activities consistent with intelligence\ncollection. Routinely monitoring various log sources for anomalies consistent with data\nexfiltration can serve as an early warning for compromise.\nOrganizations previously targeted by NOBELIUM might experience recurring activity\nand would benefit from implementing proactive monitoring for new attacks.\n\n## Detection and Investigation through Advanced Hunting queries\n\nFor Microsoft customers using Azure Sentinel, Microsoft 365 Defender, Microsoft Cloud App\nSecurity, or registered partners taking advantage of the free two year subscription of Azure\nActive Directory Premium Plan 2, any of the following in-product detections, investigation\nguidance, and hunting queries can help organizations accelerate their investigations into this\nactivity.\n\n### Azure Sentinel\n\nAzure Sentinel customers can use the following detection queries to look for this activity:\n\n**Detections**\n\n**Name: Azure VM Run Command operations executing a unique PowerShell script**\n\n**Description: This query identifies when the Azure Run command is used to execute a**\nunique PowerShell script on a virtual machine. The uniqueness of the PowerShell script is\ndetermined by taking a combined hash of the cmdlets it imports and the file size of the\nPowerShell script. Alerts from this detection indicate a unique PowerShell was executed in\nyour environment.\n\n**URL:** https://github.com/Azure/AzureSentinel/tree/master/Detections/AzureActivity/RareRunCommandPowerShellScript.yaml\n\n**Name: Azure VM Run Command operation executed during suspicious login window**\n\n**Description: This query identifies when the Azure Run command execution event is**\nassociated with a user and IP Address that has recently been associated by an Azure\nSentinel UEBA user entity behavior alert.\n\n**URL:** https://github.com/Azure/AzureSentinel/tree/master/Detections/MultipleDataSources/RunCommandUEBABreach.yaml\n\n**Name: Azure Portal Sign-in from another Azure Tenant**\n\n**Description: This query looks for sign-in attempts to the Azure Portal where the user who is**\nsigning in from another Azure tenant, and the IP address the login attempt is from is an\nAzure IP. A threat actor who compromises an Azure tenant may look to pivot to other tenants\nleveraging cross-tenant delegated access in this manner.\n\n**URL:** https://github.com/Azure/AzureSentinel/tree/master/Detections/SigninLogs/AzurePortalSigninfromanotherAzureTenant.yaml\n\n**Hunting Queries**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Name: Azure VM Run Command executed from Azure IP address**\n\n**Description: This query identifies any Azure VM Run Command operation executed from an**\nAzure IP address. The Run Command allows an attacker or legitimate user to execute\narbitrary PowerShell on a target VM.\n\n**URL:** https://github.com/Azure/Azure[Sentinel/tree/master/Hunting%20Queries/AzureActivity/AzureRunCommandFromAzureIP.ya](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Hunting%20Queries/AzureActivity/AzureRunCommandFromAzureIP.yaml)\nml\n\n**Name: Azure VM Run Command linked with MDE**\n\n**Description: This query identifies any Azure VM Run Command operations and links these**\noperations with MDE host logging. Logging from AzureActivity provides the IP address and\nuser name of the account that invoked the command. The MDE data provides insights into\nwhat cmdlets were loaded by the command.\n\n**URL:** https://github.com/Azure/Azure[Sentinel/tree/master/Hunting%20Queries/MultipleDataSources/AzureRunCommandMDELink](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Hunting%20Queries/MultipleDataSources/AzureRunCommandMDELinked.yaml)\ned.yaml\n\n**Name: Dormant Service Principal Update Creds and Logs In**\n\n**Description: This query look for Service Principal accounts that are no longer used where a**\nuser has added or updated credentials for them before logging in with the Service Principal.\n\n**URL:** https://github.com/Azure/Azure[Sentinel/tree/master/Hunting%20Queries/MultipleDataSources/DormantServicePrincipalUpd](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Hunting%20Queries/MultipleDataSources/DormantServicePrincipalUpdateCredsandLogsIn.yaml)\nateCredsandLogsIn.yaml\n\n**Name: Dormant User Update MFA and Logs In**\n\n**Description: This query looks for user accounts that have not been successfully logged into**\nrecently, who then have a MFA method added or updated before logging in.\n\n**URL:** https://github.com/Azure/Azure[Sentinel/tree/master/Hunting%20Queries/MultipleDataSources/DormantUserUpdateMFAand](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Hunting%20Queries/MultipleDataSources/DormantUserUpdateMFAandLogsIn.yaml)\nLogsIn.yaml\n\n### Microsoft 365 Defender\n\nMicrosoft 365 Defender provides detection for one of the cloud persistence techniques\ncommonly used by NOBELIUM. That persistence technique relies on maintaining access to\nvictims’ mail system through the modification of permissions and addition of hidden\ncredentials that allow the attacker to access emails remotely. This alert is based on a\ncombination of multiple signals and telemetry that originates from Microsoft Cloud App\nSecurity and is triggered either based on the risk score of the account involved or based on\nthe suspicious IP address used to access emails.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Detection Name: Suspicious Addition of an Exchange related App Role**\n**Description: Addition of an Exchange related application role was observed. An account**\nthat can authenticate against an application service principal may also be able to access\nExchange data and email. This alert was triggered based on another Microsoft Cloud App\nSecurity alert related to the potentially compromised user account.\n\n### Microsoft Cloud Application Security\n\n**Review and audit users and accounts and their activities: Microsoft Cloud App Security**\nprovides a quick page to enumerate all the users and accounts but filtering specifically to find\n“external” users with admin privilege. Once these users and accounts are identified, Cloud\nApp Security can assist to review some of the activities performed and recent sign-ins and\nrisk score.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud App Security also provides detection coverage for some of the NOBELIUM\ntechniques mentioned in earlier sections of this blog, including detection of post-exploitation\nactivities related to manipulation of privileged credentials and a new detection for passwordspray typically used to obtain initial foothold.\n\n**Detection Name: Activity from password-spray associated IP address**\n\n**Description: This detection compares IP addresses performing successful activities in your**\ncloud applications to IP addresses identified by Microsoft’s threat intelligence sources as\nrecently performing password spray attacks. It alerts about users that were victims of\npassword spray campaigns and managed to access your cloud applications from those\nmalicious IPs.\n\n**Detection Name: Unusual addition of credentials to an OAuth app**\n\n**Description: This detection identifies the suspicious addition of privileged credentials to an**\nOAuth app, based on baseline behavior of activities learned by the product. This can indicate\nthat an attacker has compromised the app, and is using it for malicious activity.\n\n**Detection Name: Unusual ISP for an OAuth app**\n\n**Description: This detection profiles your environment and triggers alerts when OAuth apps**\nperform activities from an unusual ISP, which could indicate an attempted breach using a\nnon-genuine OAuth provider.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Azure Defender\n\nAzure Defender provides detections for abuse of legitimate virtual machine extensions once\nan attacker has obtained token or valid credentials. Through deep analysis of Azure activity\nlogs, Azure Defender analyzes every call made by authenticated and authorized principals\nand calculates a likelihood score to determine suspicious intent of the operation and detect it.\n\n**Detection Name: Suspicious Run Command invocation detected**\n\n**Description: Azure Defender for Resource Manager identified a suspicious Run Command**\ninvocation in your subscription. Azure Run Command is a feature designed to allow\nadministrators to efficiently manage their environments. While this activity may be legitimate,\nan attacker with sufficient permissions can utilize Run Command to execute malicious code\non your virtual machine. This activity is deemed suspicious as the user rarely invokes\noperations that enable code execution. This can indicate the account is compromised and is\nbeing used with malicious intent.\n\nMicrosoft continues to track NOBELIUM’s [activities,](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/21/december-21st-2020-solorigate-resource-center/) [tactics,](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/) [malware, and](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/27/foggyweb-targeted-nobelium-malware-leads-to-persistent-backdoor/) [tools. We will](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/28/breaking-down-nobeliums-latest-early-stage-toolset/)\ncommunicate any additional insights and recommendations as we investigate their actions\nagainst our customers. We reinforce the importance of best practice security\nprecautions such as Zero-trust architecture and multi-factor authentication and\ntheir importance for everyone. Additional information on best practice security\npriorities is listed below:\n\n\n-----",
