Researchers say that this activity may continue today.\n\nThere is evidence that some initial access to some of the breached networks was through a\nMicrosoft Exchange server, indicating that the actor exploited a known vulnerability on\nunpatched machines.\n\n[Researchers at Symantec, a division of Broadcom, found that after gaining access to the](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-china-ngo-government-attacks)\ntarget machine the attacker deployed a custom loader on compromised systems with the\nhelp of the popular VLC media player.\n\nBrigid O Gorman of Symantec Threat Hunter Team told BleepingComputer that the attacker\nuses a clean version of VLC with a malicious DLL file in the same path as the media\nplayer's export functions.\n\nThe technique is known as DLL side-loading and it is widely used by threat actors to load\nmalware into legitimate processes to hide the malicious activity.\n\nApart from the custom loader, which O Gorman said Symantec does not have a name but\nhas been seen in previous attacks attributed to Cicada/APT10, the adversary also deployed\na WinVNC server to gain remote control over victim systems.\n\nThe attacker also executed the Sodamaster backdoor on compromised networks, a tool\nbelieved to be used exclusively by the Cicada threat group since at least 2020.\n\nSodamaster runs in the system memory (fileless) and is equipped to evade detection by\nlooking in the registry for clues of a sandbox environment or by delaying its execution.\n\nThe malware can also collect details about the system, search for running processes, and\ndownload and execute various payloads from the command and control server.\n\nSeveral other utilities have been observed in this campaign include:\n\nRAR archiving tool - helps compress, encrypt, or archive files, likely for exfiltration\nSystem/Network discovery - a way for attackers to learn about the systems or\nservices connected to an infected machine\nWMIExec - Microsoft command-line tool that can be used to execute commands on\nremote computers\nNBTScan - an open-source tool that has been observed being used by APT groups\nfor reconnaissance in a compromised network\n\nThe attackers’ dwell time on the networks of some of the discovered victims lasted for as\nlong as nine months, the researchers note in a report today.\n\n## A wider focus\n\n\n-----\n\nMany of the organizations targeted in this campaign appear to be government-related or\nNGOs (involved in educational or religious activities), as well as companies in the\ntelecommunications, legal, and pharmaceutical sectors.\n\nSymantec researchers highlight the wide geography of this Cicada campaign, which counts\nvictims in the U.S., Canada, Hong Kong, Turkey, Israel, India, Montenegro, and Italy.\n\nTo note, only one victim is from Japan, a country that has been the focus of the Cicada\ngroup for many years.\n\nCompared to the previous targeting from this group, which focused on Japanese-linked\ncompanies, the victims in this campaign indicate that the threat actor has broadened its\ninterest.\n\nWhile focused on Japanese-linked companies, Cicada has targeted in the past healthcare,\ndefense, aerospace, finance, maritime, biotechnology, energy, and government sectors.\n\nAt least [two members of the APT10 threat group have been charged in the U.S. for](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\ncomputer hacking activity to help the Chinese Ministry of State Security's (MSS) Tianjin\nState Security Bureau get intellectual property and confidential business information from\nmanaged service providers, U.S. government agencies, and over 45 technology\ncompanies.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[BPFDoor: Stealthy Linux malware bypasses firewalls for remote access](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bpfdoor-stealthy-linux-malware-bypasses-firewalls-for-remote-access/)\n\n[Cyberspies use IP cameras to deploy backdoors, steal Exchange emails](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyberspies-use-ip-cameras-to-deploy-backdoors-steal-exchange-emails/)\n\n[Trend Micro fixes bug Chinese hackers exploited for espionage](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trend-micro-fixes-bug-chinese-hackers-exploited-for-espionage/)\n\n[BPFDoor malware uses Solaris vulnerability to get root privileges](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bpfdoor-malware-uses-solaris-vulnerability-to-get-root-privileges/)\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[APT10](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/apt10/)\n[Backdoor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[China](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/china/)\n[Cicada](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cicada/)\n[Microsoft Exchange](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/microsoft-exchange/)\n[VLC](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/vlc/)\n[VLC Media Player](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/vlc-media-player/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
