In some cases, the sellers detail the type and number of machines found on the compromised network, as well as the types of data that could be found there.\n\n • HC3 has observed at least 65 instances of threat actors selling network access to healthcare entities on hacking forums in the past year.\n\n • Ke-La analyzed 1,000 forum posts selling network access over the past year (since August), and found that the top affected country was the United States, with 4% in the healthcare industry.\n\n • May serve as early warning to a more impactful ransomware incident, but is still an indicator of possible network compromise.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### • Written in C that encrypts files using a combination of Salsa20 and 1024-bit RSA\n\n • Targets Windows and Linux systems\n\n • Attempts to mount and encrypt unmounted partitions\n\n • Targets files stored locally and on network shares, as well as removable media\n\n • Can terminate processes prior to encryption\n\n • Deletes volume shadow copies and ignores specific directories, files, or file extensions during encryption\n\n • Can be configured to upload system information to a remote server via HTTP or HTTPS\n\n • Collected system information may include system name, username, domain, language information, and list of enumerated drives\n\n BlackMatter Leak Site URL: blackmax7su6mbwtcyo3xwtpfxpm356jjqrs34y4crcytpw7mifuedyd[.]onion/\n\n\n-----\n\n|• Group-IB analysis revealed an obvious connection between BlackMatter and DarkSide and REvil samples, especially DarkSide, as shown in the simplified table below:|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|||||\n||DarkSide|REvil|BlackMatter|\n|File Encryption|Salsa20 custom matrix; RSA-1024|Salsa20; Curve25519|Salsa20 custom matrix; RSA-1024|\n|Obfuscation|Same|Same|Same|\n|Privilege Escalation|UAC bypass optional with ICMLuaUtlil|UAC bypass optional with CVE-2018-8453|UAC bypass with ICMLuaUtil if necessary|\n|Defense Evasion|Binary config data with custom encoding|JSON config data with RC4 encoding|Binary config data with custom encoding|\n|Language Check|Optional (configuration)|Optional (configuration)|No|\n|Mutex name|Optional (configuration)|Hardcoded|Optional (configuration)|\n|Victim ID / Ransom Extension|Created based on MachineGuid|Random|Created based on MachineGuid|\n|Linux Version|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|||||\n\n\n\n#### • Group-IB analysis revealed an obvious connection between BlackMatter and DarkSide and REvil samples, especially DarkSide, as shown in the simplified table below:\n\n DarkSide REvil BlackMatter\n\n File Encryption Salsa20 custom matrix; Salsa20; Curve25519 Salsa20 custom matrix; RSA-1024 RSA-1024\n\n Obfuscation Same Same Same\n\n Privilege Escalation UAC bypass optional with UAC bypass optional with UAC bypass with ICMLuaUtlil CVE-2018-8453 ICMLuaUtil if necessary\n\n Defense Evasion Binary config data with JSON config data with Binary config data with custom encoding RC4 encoding custom encoding\n\n Language Check Optional (configuration) Optional (configuration) No\n\n Mutex name Optional (configuration) Hardcoded Optional (configuration)\n\n Victim ID / Ransom Created based on Random Created based on Extension MachineGuid MachineGuid\n\n Linux Version Yes Yes Yes\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Feature|REvil|Lockbit 2.0|DarkSide|BlackMatter|\n|Type|RaaS|RaaS|RaaS|RaaS|\n|Network first|-|Yes|No|No|\n|Multi-threaded|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|File encryption|In-place|In-place|In-place|In-place|\n|Encrypt size|Full|Partial, 4 KB|Partial, 512 KB|Partial, 1024 KB|\n|Rename|After|After|Before|Before|\n|Decryption Blob|End of File|End of File|End of File|End of File|\n|Wallpaper|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|\n|Encrypts Russian systems|No|Yes|No|Yes|\n||||||\n\n\n\n#### • To better understand the potential relationships between the ransomware groups, Sophos has analyzed a BlackMatter ransomware sample and uncovered a number of technical similarities with DarkSide and the other ransomware families that are worth noting:\n\n Feature REvil Lockbit 2.0 DarkSide BlackMatter\n\n Type RaaS RaaS RaaS RaaS\n\n Network first - Yes No No\n\n Multi-threaded Yes Yes Yes Yes\n\n File encryption In-place In-place In-place In-place\n\n Encrypt size Full Partial, 4 KB Partial, 512 KB Partial, 1024 KB\n\n Rename After After Before Before\n\n Decryption End of File End of File End of File End of File Blob\n\n Wallpaper Yes Yes Yes Yes\n\n Encrypts No Yes No Yes Russian systems\n\n\n-----\n\n#### BlackMatter Victims\n\n**Legend**\n\nVictim\n\nReal Estate\n\nLegal **Takeaways**\n\nFood & Beverage\n\n#### • Some victims are outside initial target geography\n\nIT Services\n\n#### • Most victims have far lower revenue than target of $100M\n\nEducation\n\n#### • No healthcare or public health sector victims observed\n\nArchitecture\n\n\n-----\n\n#### General efforts to help prevent ransomware attacks include:\n\n 1.

While there have not been any public healthcare victims yet, BlackMatter’s suspected predecessors\n\n targeted the healthcare sector.\n    o HPH organizations should remain on alert despite the
