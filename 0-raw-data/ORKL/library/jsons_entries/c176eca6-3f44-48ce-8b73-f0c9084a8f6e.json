The ransomware also deletes the volume shadow\ncopies and other system backups and typically demands a ransom ranging between $150\nand $900. Since the ransomware uses strong encryption algorithms like AES256 and\nRSA2048, no decryptor is available and it is impossible to decrypt the file without the key that\nwas used to encrypt it. This ransomware is sold similar to other Ransomware-as-a\n\n-----\n\nservice(RaaS) like REvil. Thus, even someone with limited technical background can\nbecome an “affiliate” to spread the malware. In return, the profit gets shared between the\nthreat actor and the affiliate. In this blog post we dissect this malware and discuss methods\nto perform threat hunting for the Avaddon ransomware family.\n\n**Understanding and Hunting for Avaddon**\n\nThe Avaddon malware campaign began in early June 2020. The malware is delivered and\nspreads mainly using phishing emails containing a malicious attachment. The email contains\nwhat appears to be a zipped image attachment named in the format of IMG <random-6**digits>.jpg.js. However, as you will notice the attachment is actually a JavaScript file. Since**\noperating systems often hide file extensions of common file formats, the threat actor\nattempts to deceive the viewer into thinking the JavaScript file is actually an image..\n\nFigure 1: Phishing Email (Source: Bleeping Computer)\n\nFigure 2: Avaddon JScript Downloader (Source: Bleeping Computer)\n\n\n-----\n\nExecuting this JavaScript file results in the download of the Avaddon ransomware from an\nexternal C2 server, through a combination of PowerShell and the BITS admin tool (Indicator\n**#1).**\n\nFigure 3: Avaddon Ransomware download using PowerShell and BITS\n\nThe ransomware does not perform much command and control (C2) communication.\n[However, as soon as the binary is executed, it connects to https://api.myip.com to get the](https://api.myip.com/)\nexternal IP address of the victim machine(Indicator #2).\n\nFigure 4: Network Traffic from Avaddon\n\n\n-----\n\n**Threat Hunting for Avaddon**\n\nSecurity analysts can hunt for Avaddon download attempts by correlating and detecting the\npattern of phishing email activity along with binary download using PowerShell and BITS\nadmin that we describe above.\n\nIn fact, the Awake Security Platform identifies this sequence of actions and surfaces the\n[malicious behavior on the network (similar to MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1566, T1197). The](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/)\nplatform then creates a graphical visualization of the attack Situation as shown in Figure 5\nbelow, demonstrating that a Windows device is accessing gmail.com and an IP address,\nwhich in this case is the Avaddon C2 server.\n\nFigure 5: Awake Situation for Avaddon Download\n\n**Remediation**\n\nIt is recommended to backup all important data to external drives or in the cloud for better\nsecurity. It is advised not to screen all email and refrain from opening any attachment from\nunknown sources. Finally, identify the sequence and patterns of communication we describe\nhere to uncover the presence of Avaddon on your network.\n\n**References**\n\n## Subscribe!\n\nIf you liked what you just read, subscribe to hear about our threat research and security\nanalysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nAshish Gahlot\n\nThreat Researcher\n\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishga21/)\n\n\n-----",
