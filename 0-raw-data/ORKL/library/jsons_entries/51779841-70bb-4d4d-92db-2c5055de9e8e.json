Sygnia’s forensic\ninvestigation into the attack revealed a sophisticated threat actor who exhibited robust capabilities\nand employed a methodical approach. The evidence gathered suggests the involvement of a\nChina-nexus state-sponsored threat actor.\nVelvet Ant is a sophisticated and innovative threat actor. The investigation confirmed the threat\nactor maintained a prolonged presence in the organization’s on–premises network for about three\nyears. The overall goal behind this campaign was to maintain access to the target network for\nespionage.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actor achieved remarkable persistence by establishing and maintaining multiple\nfootholds within the victim company’s environment. One of the mechanisms utilized for\npersistence was a legacy F5 BIG-IP appliance, which was exposed to the internet and which the\nthreat actor leveraged as an internal Command and Control (C&C).\nAfter one foothold was discovered and remediated, the threat actor swiftly pivoted to another,\ndemonstrating agility and adaptability in evading detection.\nThe threat actor exploited various entry points across the victim’s network infrastructure,\nindicating a comprehensive understanding of the target’s environment.\nThis incident highlights the importance of establishing resilient defense strategies against\nsophisticated threats – particularly those posed by state-sponsored groups. A holistic approach to\nmitigating these threats combines continuous monitoring with proactive response mechanisms –\nincluding periodic and systematic threat hunts – alongside stringent traffic controls and system\nhardening practices for both legacy and public-facing devices. By embracing such an approach,\norganizations can enhance their ability to detect, deter, and counteract the persistent threat\npresented by state-sponsored groups.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn late 2023, Sygnia responded to a cyber attack targeting a large organization. During the\ninvestigation, Sygnia determined that the threat actor exhibited behaviors like those of a China-nexus\nthreat actor. This threat actor, which Sygnia tracks as Velvet Ant, maintained access to the\norganization’s network for at least three years, and had succeeded in gaining a strong foothold, and\nintimate knowledge of the network.\n\nOver the course of the attack, the threat actor adeptly used various tools and techniques to infiltrate\ncritical systems and obtain access to sensitive data. The prolonged period of the attack allowed the\nthreat actor to familiarize itself with the complex network infrastructure, enabling it to conceal\npersistence mechanisms within overlooked areas. Although Sygnia eventually ousted the threat actor\nfrom the network, the eradication process resembled a relentless game of cat-and-mouse. Despite\nSygnia’s diligent efforts to remediate compromised systems and enhance visibility into hosts and\nnetwork devices, the threat actor resurfaced time and again through the use of dormant persistence\nmechanisms in unmonitored systems.\n\nThis blog describes the usage of one of those mechanisms, which included leveraging legacy servers\nand unpatched network appliances.\n\n## It all began with PlugX\n\n[Throughout the duration of the attack, one of Velvet Ant’s attack techniques was to hijack execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/)\n[flow, by leveraging different methods such as DLL search order hijacking, Phantom DLL loading and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/)\n[DLL side loading.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)\n\nSoon after starting the forensic investigation, Sygnia identified the various tools employed by the threat\nactor, determined the scope of compromise, and formulated a remediation plan. The plan combined\neradication, remediation, and visibility enhancement, which focused on the threat actor’s Tactics,\nTechniques and Procedures (TTPs).\n\nThe plan was executed successfully. Alerts that were configured to identify re-entry attempts were not\ntriggered, and Sygnia’s experts worked with the IT and security teams of the victim company to bolster\noverall security. However, the success of the remediation and hardening efforts drove the threat actor to\nfocus on legacy operating systems, targeting Windows Server 2003 systems on which the\n\n\n-----\n\norganization’s Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) product was not installed, and logging was\nlimited. The threat actor resumed activity by utilizing previously deployed malware that remained\ndormant for months in the victim environment. The malware was identified as PlugX, a well-known\nremote access Trojan.\n\n[PlugX has been used by multiple Chinese state sponsored groups since 2008. The tool is still widely](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fattack.mitre.org.mcas.ms%2Fsoftware%2FS0013%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D20892&McasCSRF=https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0013/)\n[deployed – although its successor, ShadowPad has been in use since 2015. PlugX was primarily](https://www.recordedfuture.com/2023-adversary-infrastructure-report)\ndesigned to provide remote access to infected systems. However, it has a modular plugin system,\nwhich provides attackers with a large set of additional capabilities that can be utilized for nefarious\npurposes.\n\nThe PlugX execution chain in this network consisted of three files: ‘iviewers.exe’, ‘iviewers.dll’ and\n‘iviewers.dll.ui’.\n\n‘iviewers.exe’ is a legitimate application called ’OLE/COM Object Viewer‘, that is part of the\nWindows SDK.\n‘iviewers.dll’ is the malicious PlugX DLL loader, that is loaded by ‘iviewers.exe’ via DLL search\norder hijacking.\n‘iviewers.dll.ui’ contains the actual malicious payload, which is loaded by ‘iviewers.dll’.\n\nWhen ‘iviewers.exe’ is executed, these three files are copied to a sub-directory with a non-fixed name\nunder ‘C:\\ProgramData’ (or ‘C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data’, on Windows\nServer 2003 systems), and ‘iviewers.exe’ is installed as a Windows service. Afterwards, several\n‘Svchost’ processes are launched, and code is injected into them.\n\n_Figure 1: Snippet from Sygnia’s Velocity XDR system, showing the three files that were created_\n\n_by the malware on an infected system. The creation time of the files was manipulated by the_\n\n_malware and does not reflect the actual creation time._\n\n_Figure 2: Snippet from VMRay sandbox, showing a process graph for an execution of_\n\n_‘iviewers.exe’._\n\nThroughout the investigation, Sygnia acquired memory dumps of those ‘Svchost’ processes, which\nproved helpful in tracking the threat actor’s activities – especially on legacy servers, where logs were\nlacking. The memory dumps contained harvested credentials and various commands executed by the\nthreat actor.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Snippet from a memory dump of an injected ‘Svchost’ process, showing credential_\n\n_harvesting._\n\n_Figure 4: Snippet from a memory dump of an injected ‘Svchost’ process, showing part of a_\n\n_command that was executed to scan an internal network segment._\n\n### Lateral Movement and C&C\n\nWhen moving laterally to workstations installed with newer Windows versions, the threat actor\nconsistently tampered with the EDR product prior to installing PlugX. On one occasion, the threat actor\nattempted to disable the EDR product on a target workstation but failed, and then did not proceed to\ninstall PlugX. This demonstrates a high level of operational security (OPSEC) awareness.\n\n[Impacket, an open-source collection of Python classes, was used for lateral tool transfer, and to](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/tree/master)\n[execute code remotely on hosts. Specifically, the threat actor employed Impacket’s wmiexec.py, a tool](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/tree/master)\nthat utilizes the native Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute remote commands.\n\n_Figure 5: Snippet from an MFT entry of a file created by WmiExec to store command output._\n_This output belongs to a ‘del’ command, which was executed to delete EDR anti-malware logs._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PlugX C&C address, 202.61.136[.]158, was also found in these memory dumps. This allowed the\ncreation of network-based detections, and assisted Sygnia in scoping the incident.\n\n_Figure 6: Snippet from VirusTotal, showing that the malware’s C&C IP address was identified as_\n\n_a PlugX C&C server._\n\nThe ‘Svchost’ process launched by ‘iviewers.exe’ binds to a pre-configured local port and accepts TCP\nconnections. It also creates a new rule in the Windows firewall called ‘Network Discovery (SSDP-In)’, to\nallow these connections. This behavior did not seem to be related to the C&C mechanism, and its\npurpose was initially unclear.\n\n_Figure 7: Snippet from Sygnia’s XDR system, Velocity, showing a Sysmon process creation_\n\n_event for a ‘netsh’ command which was launched on a legacy file serve by the injected_\n\n_‘Svchost’ process to create a local firewall rule._\n\nThe purpose of the local firewall rule soon became clear, following a kill-switch operation that initiated a\ndramatic turn of events.\n\n\n-----\n\n### PlugX is Dead; Long Live PlugX\n\nEquipped with the forensic investigation findings, the Sygnia team again worked with the victim\ncompany to eradicate the discovered threats. Dozens of compromised hosts were re-imaged, many of\nthe legacy servers were decommissioned, hundreds of indicators of compromise (IOCs) were blocked\nacross the network, and all the known instances of threat actor access to the network were eradicated.\n\nThe victim organization has a large network with complex architecture. The post-breach remediation\nplan designed by Sygnia included prioritized tasks divided into immediate and mid-term\nrecommendations. As a standard procedure, Sygnia enhanced the organization’s visibility, and\nestablished advanced monitoring based on the indicators of attack (IOA).\n\nSeveral days after eliminating Velvet Ant’s presence, the advanced monitoring capabilities that were\ndeployed in the network proved their value, as alerts were triggered when PlugX was deployed on\nnewly-infected systems. Sygnia’s investigation team quickly analyzed the new infections and noticed a\nsubstantial difference in the memory dump acquired from the newly infected hosts – there was no\nexternal C&C configured. This was puzzling; PlugX is a remote access tool – how can it be deployed\nwithout a C&C server, and still be effective?\n\nAdditional forensic analysis revealed that the threat actor reconfigured PlugX to use an internal file\nserver as its C&C and channeled traffic through that server. This defense evasion technique allowed\nthe C&C traffic to blend in with legitimate internal network traffic.\n\nThis meant that the threat actor deployed two versions of PlugX within the network. The first version,\nconfigured with an external C&C server, was installed on endpoints with direct internet access,\nfacilitating the exfiltration of sensitive information. The second version did not have a C&C and was\ndeployed exclusively on legacy servers.\n\nThis left us with unanswered questions. How did the threat actor control the legacy file server? And how\ndid they manage to restore access to the organization despite the comprehensive remediation\nactivities? To answer these questions, Sygnia’s incident response team set up additional network and\nhost-based monitoring tools on the file server and closely monitored for any suspicious activities.\n\nAs shown in figure 7, PlugX created a local firewall rule on compromised endpoints and listened on a\nhigh, random port number. On the file server, port 13742 was opened. Analyzing network connections\nto the file server identified an internal IP address communicating with it on the same port. The internal\nIP address belonged to an F5 load balancer.\n\n_Figure 8: Snippet from Sygnia’s XDR system, Velocity, showing the network connection event_\n\n_from the F5 load balancer to the file server on port 13742._\n\nThis load balancer was not part of previous remediation efforts, because it was not supposed to be\noperational in the production network. One team in the organization started deploying the F5 solution in\nthe network a long time ago as part of a disaster recovery plan (DRP), but the project was never\ncompleted.\n\n\n-----\n\n## F5 BIG-IP – The Perfect Place to Hide\n\nF5 BIG-IP appliances occupy a trusted position within the network architecture, often placed at the\nperimeter or between different network segments. By compromising such a device, attackers can exert\nsignificant control over network traffic without arousing suspicion. Moreover, while organizations\nfrequently gather logs from network devices, their attention is predominantly directed towards\napplication-level logs such as traffic records and alerts. Unfortunately, operating system logs are often\noverlooked, either due to vendor constraints or a lack of recognition regarding their significance. As a\nresult, a backdoor hidden within the F5 appliance can evade detection from traditional log monitoring\nsolutions.\n\nThe compromised organization had two F5 BIG-IP appliances which provided services such as firewall,\nWAF, load balancing and local traffic management. These appliances were directly exposed to the\ninternet, and both of which were compromised.\n\nBoth F5 appliances were running an outdated, vulnerable, operating system. The threat actor may have\nleveraged one of the vulnerabilities to gain remote access to the appliances. However, visibility\nlimitations hinder the ability to identify exactly how the appliances were compromised.​\n\nForensic investigation of the appliances revealed a reverse SSH tunnel connection to the same C&C IP\naddress that was previously blocked on the corporate firewalls during the eradication efforts. Since the\nappliances were not located behind the main corporate firewall, the traffic was not blocked.\n\n_Figure 9: Snippet showing the output of a ‘ps’ command executed on one of the F5 appliances._\n\n_The threat actor created a reverse SSH tunnel to the C&C with a user named ‘leo’._\n\nAnalyzing the active network connections on the F5, an established connection was observed between\nthe appliance and the file server, on the port PlugX was listening on. This complemented the analysis\nmade on the file server itself (see figure 8).\n\n_Figure 10: Snippet from an output of ‘netstat’ command executed on the F5 appliance, showing_\n\n_the connection to the file server._\n\n_Figure 11: Snippet extracted from Wireshark, showing that the traffic transmitted from the F5_\n_appliances was sent to port 13742 of the file server. This is the port that PlugX was listening on_\n\n_in this server._\n\n### Pivoting From the F5 Appliance\n\nThe figure below depicts the stages of the threat actor’s working flow.\n\n(1) The malware running on the device polls the C&C server once an hour. After connecting to the C&C\nserver (2), the threat actor sends commands to the compromised appliance, including for the creation\nof a reverse SSH tunnel (3). Once the tunnel with the appliance is established, the threat actor\n\n\n-----\n\nconnects to the file server that is infected with PlugX (4).\n\nThe PlugX instance on the compromised file server was used by the threat actor as an internal C&C\nserver. From this server, the threat actor conducted reconnaissance activities, deployed additional\ninstances of the PlugX onto legacy servers by leveraging Impacket’s WmiExec (5).\n\n_Figure 12: Diagram showing how the F5 appliance was leveraged by the threat actor as a_\n_persistent beachhead, utilized to move laterally and execute remote commands on different_\n\n_servers._\n\nRecording the traffic between the F5 appliance and the file server revealed additional details about the\nthreat actor’s TTPs, as the traffic was sent over SMB, and was not encrypted. The following figures\nshow the interactive activities conducted by the threat actor prior to deploying additional PlugX\ninstances.\n\nThe threat actor’s first step was to enumerate the active network connections on the targeted server:\n\n_Figure 13: Snippet extracted from Wireshark, showing that the threat actor enumerated the_\n\n_active network connections before moving laterally to additional servers._\n\nAfter selecting a new server for PlugX deployment, the threat actor listed files in different folders,\npresumably in order to choose where to deploy the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14: Snippet from Wireshark showing how the threat actor enumerated additional legacy_\n\n_systems within the network by executing commands through WmiExec._\n\nThe threat actor then chose a folder, and leveraged WmiExec to transfer PlugX over SMB from the file\nserver to the target server.\n\n_Figure 15: Snippet from Wireshark showing the iviewers PlugX variant being sent over SMB_\n\n_and saved into the ‘C:\\tools\\’ folder._\n\n### Additional Malware on the F5 Appliances\n\nForensic analysis of the F5 appliances identified four binaries deployed by the threat actor:\n\n1. VELVETSTING – a tool that connects to the threat actor’s C&C once an hour, searching\n\ncommands to execute. The threat actor used the IP address 202.61.136[.]158:8443 as a C&C\nand the commands were encoded with the passphrase ‘1qaz@WSXedc’. Once the tool received\na command, it was executed via ‘csh’ (Unix C shell).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16: Snippet showing the output of the ‘strace’ command, which monitored the_\n_‘VELVETSTING’ process. The malware tried to connect to the C&C server on port 8443 every_\n\n_3600 seconds (1 hour). Once the connection was successful, the malware created a child_\n\n_process based on the commands it received from the C&C._\n\n2. VELVETTAP – a tool with the ability to capture network packets. The binary was executed on the\n\nF5 appliance with the argument ‘mgmt’, which is the name of the internal NIC of the F5 device.\n\n_Figure 17: Snippet from an output of ‘ifconfig’ command, showing the ‘mgmt’ network interface_\n\n_on the F5 appliance._\n\nTo maintain persistence on the F5 appliance, the threat actor added both VELVETSTING and\nVELVETTAP to the ‘/etc/rc.local’ file. ‘rc.local’ is executed as part of the system’s startup process, which\nmeans that any commands or scripts listed in it will be executed automatically whenever the system\nboots up.\n\n_Figure 18: Snippet showing that the paths for VELVETSTING and VELVETTAP were added to_\n\n_the ‘/etc/rc.local’ file by the threat actor._\n\n\n-----\n\n3. SAMRID – identified as ‘EarthWorm’, an open-source SOCKS proxy tunneller available on\n\n[GitHub. The tool was utilized in the past by different Chinese state-sponsored groups, such as](https://github.com/rootkiter/EarthWorm)\n[‘Volt Typhoon’, ‘APT27’ and ‘Gelsemium’. The tool was not running on the device at the time of](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1017/)\ninvestigation.\n4. ESRDE – a tool with similar capabilities to that of ‘VELVETSTING’, but with minor differences,\n\nsuch as using bash instead of ‘csh’. The tool was not running on the device at the time of\ninvestigation.\n\n## A Note on Attribution\n\nThe attack described in this blog demonstrates a single attack flow of Velvet Ant, a threat actor that\nexhibited characteristics like those of a China-nexus state sponsored threat actor. These include but\nare not limited to target selection (industry and geo-location), clear definition of goals, targeting of\nnetwork devices, exploitation of vulnerabilities, and a toolset that includes the ShadowPad and PlugX\nmalware families, and utilization of DLL side-loading techniques. The threat actor was extremely\npersistent and remained active in the compromised network for about three years, despite several\neradication attempts throughout that period.\n\nThe modus operandi of Chinese-nexus Intrusion Sets includes shared tools, infrastructure, and\nsometimes manpower – for example via shared contractors. This mode of operation makes it difficult\nfor Sygnia to attribute the attack to any previously publicly-reported group. Moreover, the visibility\navailable in the network prevents Sygnia from ruling out a ‘false-flag’ operation conducted by a different\nAdvanced Persistent Threat (APT) group.\n\n## Defending Against Velvet Ant\n\nThe defense strategies presented below are designed to provide organizations with robust measures\nfor countering threats related to C&C and the malicious weaponization of legacy and edge devices\nstrengthening organizational cyber security defenses and strengthening resilience against advanced\npersistent attacks.\n\n**Limit outbound internet traffic: Outbound internet connections should be restricted across**\nservers, workstations, and edge devices, to prevent attackers from maintaining access via\nCommand and Control (C&C) channels – similar to the tactic of utilizing the PlugX loader.\nConfigure perimeter firewalls to allow only the necessary outbound connections, placing internetfacing devices such as load balancers behind these firewalls to prevent direct public access.\n**Limit lateral movement throughout the network: Performing lateral movement within networks**\nis a technique frequently employed by threat actors using tools like WmiExec. To mitigate this\nrisk, it is essential to rigorously control traffic over common management ports. These include\nSMB on port 445, RPC on port 135, WinRM on ports 5985-5986, RDP on port 3389, and SSH on\nport 22. Access should be strictly limited to hosts with explicit authorization. Although\nimplementing such controls poses challenges in complex network environments, the security\nbenefits are substantial. Mitigation strategies may include deploying host-based\nfirewalls,establishing effective network segmentation, and adopting cutting-edge\nmicrosegmentation technologies.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Enhance security hardening of legacy servers: Prioritize decommissioning and replacement of**\nlegacy systems. Tighten control over legacy servers, which are prime targets for cyberattacks due\nto their weaker defenses. Enhance security by installing Endpoint protection tools that support\nolder systems such as Windows Server 2003, or using alternatives like Sysmon for\ncomprehensive monitoring. Strengthen protections by limiting access to essential staff, enforcing\nstrict network segmentation, and monitoring traffic to and from these servers. These steps\nconsiderably reduce the vulnerabilities inherent in older server infrastructures.\n**Mitigate credential harvesting: Implement Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems**\nfor continuous monitoring and interception of malicious actions. Ensure that EDR sensors are\nconfigured with anti-tampering features, and are consistently operational and current, as attackers\nmight attempt to neutralize or circumvent the sensors. Apply Protected Process Light (PPL) to\nLSASS, and activate Windows Credential Guard for credential security.\n**Protect public-facing devices: To improve the security of public-facing edge devices such as F5**\nBIG-IP load balancers, it is essential to implement a proactive security strategy that includes\nexternal attack surface and asset management, patch management, Intrusion Detection and\nPrevention Systems, and robust security and integrity monitoring. Additionally, migration to cloudbased solutions such as SASE or cloud-native load balancers can reduce the risk of running\nvulnerable, exploitable edge devices.

Zero-Day](https://www.sygnia.co/threat-reports-and-advisories/defending-your-network-edge-against-the-next-zero-day-exploit/)\n[Exploit”, which outlines key measures for enhancing the resilience of network edges against](https://www.sygnia.co/threat-reports-and-advisories/defending-your-network-edge-against-the-next-zero-day-exploit/)\nthreats demonstrated by this threat actor, and other emerging threats.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix I: Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Value** **Type** **Description**\n\nd1e6767900c85535f300e08d76aac9ab MD5
