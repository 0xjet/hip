However, these hostilities were not limited to the physical domain. Cyber warfare\nis happening in parallel to the armed conflict, becoming an inseperable part of the hostile\nexchanges between these nations.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur Threat Research team noted various cyberattacks deployed by Russia in the weeks\npreceding the invasion aimed at sowing chaos and disrupting communications within Ukraine’s\ngovernment and military institutions. While the most publicized of these cyberattacks were the\nDDoS attacks, official government website take-downs, and website defacements, the most\n[disruptive attack was a disk-wiping malware called WhisperGate which we covered in a previous](https://www.deepinstinct.com/blog/the-ukrainian-government-cyberattack-what-you-need-to-know)\npost.\n\nOn February 23, one day before the larger Russian land invasion began, Ukrainian organizations\nwere targeted by another destructive disk-wiping malware dubbed HermeticWiper designed to\nwipe a computer’s hard disk data and destroy the Master Boot Record and partitions, making any\nimpacted machines inoperable.\n\nWhat is HermeticWiper\n\nHermeticWiper makes use of a driver belonging to an outdated version of EaseUS Partition\nMaster application, developed by CHENGDU YIWO Tech Development. The attackers used a\nbenign, digitally signed kernel driver to evade detection while utilizing the driver's ability to\ninteract with storage devices and acquire low-level disk access for retrieving partition information,\ncorrupting the device’s disks.\n\nWhile the driver is digitally signed by ‘Hermetica Digital Ltd’ (hence the wiper name), the\ncertificate is now revoked.\n\nFigure1 – left – EaseUS invalid signed driver; right – HermeticWiper signed certificate\nThe malware stores 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the driver in MS-compressed copies within its\nresource section, deploying it according to the operating system version. Forensic analysis\nreveals that the malware has several variants, one with a timestamp dating to December 2021,\n\n\n-----\n\nindicating the attack has been in progress for quite some time.\n\nWe've observed several attacks which precede the execution of the wiper. In one case, the\n[attackers exploited a known vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server (CVE-2021-1636) to gain a](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1636)\nfoothold in one of the Ukrainian organizations. In a separate case, the attackers gained access to\nthe network via malicious SMB activity against a Microsoft Exchange Server, which led to\ncredential theft, and later to the deployment of the wiper. Several other methods were also\n[employed, including the Apache Tomcat vulnerability, which allowed the attackers to run](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1938)\nPowerShell commands, dump credentials, and execute the malware.\n\nWhen executed, HermeticWiper will first gain higher privileges by utilizing Access Token\nManipulation [T1134] and then obtain \"SeBackupPrivilege\" (which allows it to retrieve any file\ncontent) and \"SeLoadDriverPrivilege\" (which allows it to load/unload any driver). As we\npreviously mentioned, HermeticWiper uses EaseUS signed driver in order to manipulate the\ndisk.\n\nNext, HermeticWiper will disable Volume Shadow Service (vss) and disable crash dumps by\nmodifying specific registry keys, ensuring that no backups will be available and covering its\ntracks.\n\nIt will then enumerate the system’s physical drives. For each, it will then corrupt the first 512\nbytes and destroy the Master Boot Record (MBR).\n\nWhile this should be enough to make any computer inoperable, HermeticWiper doesn't stop\nthere. It next checks for NTFS or FAT file systems and corrupts them, ensuring that systems with\nboth MBR and GPT drives are compromised. The Wiper will then force system shutdown to\ncomplete the wiping operation.\n\n[Similar to the previous WhisperGate attack, where the wiper was disguised as ransomware, the](https://www.deepinstinct.com/ransomware-protection-solution)\nattackers appear to be using PartyTicket ransomware as a decoy in addition to the\nHermeticWiper malware to distract from the wiper attacks.\n\nRussia-Ukraine Cyber Warfare\n\nAs we mention above, Russia started its cyberattack campaign long before the armed forces\ninvasion. However, after the HermeticWiper attack began on February 23 we’ve seen a surge in\ncyber warfare between the two countries.\n\nHere is the timeline of the major events:\n\nFeb 23\n\nUkraine’s ministry of foreign affairs and the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU)\nwebsites were taken down while Ukrainian troops received threatening SMS\nmessages with the aim of demoralizing them by urging them to flee or be killed.\nSandworm/VoodooBear group, both of which have previously been attributed to the\nRussian military intelligence service (GRU), use Cyclops Blink, a Linux malware\nwhich can extract device information and download additional payload.\nFeb 24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe portal of the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine is defaced by a\ngroup named Free Civilian. The group offers databases containing sensitive\ngovernment and citizens information for sale.\nThe Anonymous hacking collective announced their support for Ukraine with the\nfollowing message:\n\nFigure2 – Anonymous group declaration\nFeb 25\n\nA massive phishing email campaign targets Ukrainian troops’ private “i.ua” and\n“meta.ua” accounts, delivered by UNC1151 (aka GhostWriter) which relates to officers\nof the “Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Belarus.”\nThe infamous Conti group announces their full support the Russian government in the\nfollowing blog post:\n\nFigure 4 – Conti group declaration\nFeb 26 - The Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykhailo Fedorov announces the creation of\nthe “IT Army,” crowdsourced offensive operations against Russian infrastructure, aimed\nat recruiting cyber specialists willing to help.\nFeb 27 - The LockBit ransomware group declares they will leak all victims’ data\n\n\n-----\n\nFeb 28 – One of Conti group members begins leaking data from the group s chat after their\nprevious announcement supporting the Russian government.\n\nIOCs\n\nContext sha256\n\nEaseUS driver e5f3ef69a534260e899a36cec459440dc572388defd8f1d98760d31c700f42d5\n\nEaseUS driver b01e0c6ac0b8bcde145ab7b68cf246deea9402fa7ea3aede7105f7051fe240c1\n\nEaseUS driver b6f2e008967c5527337448d768f2332d14b92de22a1279fd4d91000bb3d4a0fd\n\nEaseUS driver fd7eacc2f87aceac865b0aa97a50503d44b799f27737e009f91f3c281233c17d\n\nEaseUS driver 96b77284744f8761c4f2558388e0aee2140618b484ff53fa8b222b340d2a9c84\n\nEaseUS driver 8c614cf476f871274aa06153224e8f7354bf5e23e6853358591bf35a381fb75b\n\nEaseUS driver 23ef301ddba39bb00f0819d2061c9c14d17dc30f780a945920a51bc3ba0198a4\n\nEaseUS driver 2c7732da3dcfc82f60f063f2ec9fa09f9d38d5cfbe80c850ded44de43bdb666d\n\nHermeticWiper 1bc44eef75779e3ca1eefb8ff5a64807dbc942b1e4a2672d77b9f6928d292591\n\n\n-----\n\nHermeticWiper 0385eeab00e946a302b24a91dea4187c1210597b8e17cd9e2230450f5ece21da\n\nHermeticWiper ca3c4cd3c2edc816c1130e6cac9bdd08f83aef0b8e6f3d09c2172c854fab125f\n\nHermeticWiper 2c10b2ec0b995b88c27d141d6f7b14d6b8177c52818687e4ff8e6ecf53adf5bf\n\nHermeticWiper 3c557727953a8f6b4788984464fb77741b821991acbf5e746aebdd02615b1767\n\nPartyTicket 4dc13bb83a16d4ff9865a51b3e4d24112327c526c1392e14d56f20d6f4eaf382\n\nPredictions and guidance\n\nThe ongoing Russian-Ukrainian conflict is already causing a significant escalation in the quantity\nand scope of attacks from many, disparate parties. Elevated activity is being seen from statesponsored groups, non-state-sponsored actors, and by independent hacktivists like the\nAnonymous group.\n\nThe unprecedented raft of sanctions enacted against Russia may invoke further retaliation and\nresponse in the form of cyberattacks by Russian-based organized cybercrime groups and state[sponsored or contracted actors. We have already seen several cyber gangs supporting Russia](https://twitter.com/BrettCallow/status/1497249143663652865)\nthreaten to use their resources to strike back against nations and organizations that may\ncoordinate cyberattacks against Russia.\n\nWe estimate the ongoing physical conflict escalation combined with the new sanctions will lead\nto a higher risk profile; this will be heightened for sectors associated with sanctions and have\nhigh economic or national security value. These may include financial services, aviation and\naerospace, energy, and critical infrastructure.\n\nFollowing are some key points to consider or act upon given the changes in the risk profile:\n\n[Threat actors are targeting organizations with phishing attempts related to the conflict.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ukraine-security-agency-warns-of-ghostwriter-threat-group-activity-phishing-campaigns/)\nSecurity staff should remind or re-educate employees to minimize successful social\nengineering attempts.\nEvery application in the organization can be a potential backdoor to the organization. These\napplications need to be updated frequently with the latest security patches. Organizations\nshould apply a strict application control policy while limiting applications which are not\ncritical to their business.\nScripts are a powerful execution mechanism. There are entire industries (healthcare, for\nexample) where most users in the organization have no need to execute scripts. Security\nstaff should restrict scripts execution based on a user’s roles and devices.\nTo ensure increased visibility, it is recommended to configure or enable additional layers of\nlogging when and where available.\n\n\n-----\n\nIncident response requires considerable time and resources. The initial response of the\nsecurity staff to a possible threat can make a huge difference in the overall impact of the\nattack impact. Trained security staff with a dedicated playbook for incident response\nscenarios should prevent additional infection and lateral movement inside the organization.\nIn order to be as evasive as possible threat actors have learned to live-off-the-land. With\nthe use of PowerShell and other libraries in the operating system, bad actors can stay\n[under the radar. SOC operators should be extremely attentive to potential LOLbins attacks.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/11/hunting-for-lolbins.html)\n\nProtection from HermeticWiper with Deep Instinct\n\nDeep Instinct prevents HermeticWiper and PartyTicket statically prior to execution, stopping it\nbefore it can deploy.\n\n[If you’d like to learn more, please request a demo.](https://www.deepinstinct.com/request-a-demo)\n\n\n-----",
