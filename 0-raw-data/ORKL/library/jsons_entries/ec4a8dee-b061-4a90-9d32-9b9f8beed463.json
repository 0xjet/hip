Over the years, these operations\ntargeted different sectors in multiple countries, such as Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus.\n\nIn this report, we will provide a full analysis of the TTPs utilized throughout this campaign, the\ninfrastructure, and the new tools we uncovered during our research, of what we believe to be a\nChinese-based threat actor.\n\n## Lure Documents\n\nThe investigation started when we identified two suspicious RTF documents sent to the\nMongolian public sector. The documents were written in the Mongolian language, with one of\nthem allegedly from the Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Affairs:\n\n\n-----\n\nDocument 1: Information about the prevalence of new Coronavirus infections\n\nDocument 2: Purchases for buildings in documentary projects\n\nThese RTF files were weaponized using version `7.x of a tool named RoyalRoad (aka` `8.t ).`\n\nThis tool, which is commonly used by various Chinese threat actors, allows the attacker to create\ncustomized documents with embedded objects that exploit the Equation Editor vulnerabilities of\nMicrosoft Word\n\n\n-----\n\n## Infection Chain\n\nAfter the victim opens the specially crafted RTF document, and the Microsoft Word vulnerability is\nexploited, a file named `intel.wll is dropped into the Word startup folder:`\n```\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Word\\STARTUP .\n\n```\n[This persistence technique is often used by newer versions of the so-called RoyalRoad. Every](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/)\ntime that Microsoft Word application is launched, all the DLL files with a `WLL extension in the`\nWord Startup folder would launch as well, triggering the infection chain we describe below:\n\nInfection Chain Diagram\n\nThis not only serves as a persistence technique, but also prevents the infection chain from fully\n“detonating” if run inside a sandbox, as a relaunch of Microsoft Word is required for the full\nexecution of the malware.\n\nAfter it’s loaded, the malicious `intel.wll DLL proceeds to download and decrypt the next`\nstage of the infection chain, from one of the threat actor’s servers: `95.179.242[.]6 .`\n\nThe next stage downloaded is also a DLL file, and it serves as the main loader of the malware\nframework developed by the attackers. It is executed using `Rundll32, and it communicates`\nwith another one of the threat actor’s C&C servers ( 95.179.242[.]27 ) to receive additional\nfunctionality.\n\nThe threat actor operates the C&C server in a limited daily window, going online only for a few\nhours each day, making it harder to analyze and gain access to the advanced parts of the\ninfection chain.\n\nAt the final stage of the infection chain, after the appropriate command is received, the malicious\nloader downloads and decrypts a RAT module, also in the form of a DLL file, and loads it into\nmemory. This plug-in like architecture might hint at the existence of other modules, in addition to\nthe payload we received.\n\nThe RAT module appears to be a custom and unique malware, though it also includes some\nrather common core capabilities, listed below:\n\n\n-----\n\nTake a screenshot\nList files and directories\nCreate and delete directories\nMove and delete files\nDownload a file\nExecute a new process\nGet a list of all services\n\n## Open Window\n\nAt the beginning of our research, one of the attacker’s servers, which served the next stage\nmalware, had directory listing enabled for a limited time. This allowed us to download all hosted\nfiles, as well as to gain some insight into the operation timeline and the working hours of the\nattackers.\n\nOpen directory at 95.179.242[.]6\n\nEven though they were available for download, all the files on the server came encrypted.\n\nLuckily, by utilizing the same encryption scheme seen in our infection chain, we were able to\ndecrypt most of the files stored on the server.\n\n1. key =\n\n\"VkvX7CK7X7*t$x&hssLR6fOyFSaKrFJKx&@#AK*Fnukj@J9J40f1mKaN$nsCNKPe\"\n2. def decrypt(enc,offset):\n3. decrypted = \"\"\n4. for i in range(len(enc)):\n5. decrypted += chr((ord(enc[i]) ^ ord(key[(i + offset) & 0x3f])))\n6. return decrypted\n\nDecryption scheme derived from “intel.wll”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe dozen of files that we were able to decrypt can be divided into four main clusters of malware\nloader families. Their embedded internal names and core functionality are described below:\n\n\n### pp‐ down.dll\n\n\n### Functions as downloader and decryptor for the .rar files stored on the at‐ tackers’ server. Reads an access.txt file from the server, decrypts it and splits the result into 3 parts: 1) The name of the next stage to download. 2) The next stage export function to call. 3) The decryption key for the next stage.\n\n\n### Rundl‐ l32Tem‐ plete.dll\n\n\n### This variant serves as loader and decryptor for next stage payload. The payload is encrypted in .sect section.\n\n\n### Minis‐ dllpub‐ .dll\n\n\n### The second stage loader, fully described below. Loads additional DLL plu‐ gins. A similar version of this payload, called minisdllpublog.dll, contains some additional debug printing capabilities.\n\n\nPayload types found on the server\n\n## Connection to other samples\n\nAfter gaining access to the additional decrypted files, we were able to hunt for similar samples.\n\nSearching for similar files by the internal names ( http_dll, `Rundll32Templete` and\n```\nminisdllpub ), unique exported functions ( Engdic, WSSet and MSCheck ) and code\n\n```\nsimilarities (decryption methods, communication patterns, etc.), allowed us to find more samples\nrelated to the attacker:\n\n```\n5560644578a6bcf1ba79f380ca8bd‐\nb2f9a4b40b7\n\n```\n```\nhttp_dl‐\nl.dll\n\n```\n```\n207477076d069999533e0150be06a20ba74\nd5378\n\n```\n```\nhttp_dl‐\nl.dll\n\n```\n```\nb942e1d1a0b5f0e66da3aa9bbd0f‐\nb46b8e16d71d\n\n```\n```\nhttp_dl‐\nl.dll\n\n```\n```\n9ef97f90dcdfe123ccb7d9b45e6fa9ece‐\nb2446f0\n\n```\n```\nhcc_dl‐\nl.dll\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\ncf5fb4017483cdf1d5eb659e‐\nbc9cd7d19588d935\n\n```\n```\nRundl‐\nl32Tem‐\nplete.dll\n\n```\n```\n92de0a807cf‐\nb1a332aa0d886a6981e7dee16d621\n\n```\n```\nRundl‐\nl32Tem‐\nplete.dll\n\n```\n```\ncde40c325fcf179242831a145fd918‐\nca7288d9dc\n\n```\n```\nminis‐\ndllpublog\n.dll\n\n```\n```\n2426f9db2d962a444391aa3ddf75882‐\nfaad0b67c\n\n```\n```\nIrmon‐\nSvc.dll\n\n```\n```\n9eda00aae384b2f9509‐\nfa48945ae820903912a90\n\n```\n```\nIrmon‐\nSvc.dll\n\n```\n```\n2e50c075343ab20228a8c0c094722bbf‐\nf71c4a2a\n\n```\n```\nIrmon‐\nSvc.dll\n\n```\n```\n2f80f51188d‐\nc9aea697868864d88925d64c26abc\n\n```\n```\nNWCWork‐\nsta‐\ntion.dll\n\n```\n\nNewly discovered related samples\n\nOne of the samples found ( 92de0a807cfb1a332aa0d886a6981e7dee16d621 ) led us to an\n[article covering a similar initial infection chain, which appears to be after Ukrainian targets.](https://bbs.pediy.com/thread-256810.htm)\n\nAnother sample ( 9ef97f90dcdfe123ccb7d9b45e6fa9eceb2446f0 ) was originally dropped by\n[an RTF document which appears to be targeting entities in the Russian Federation, back in late](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/5187c9a84f5e69ba4b08538c3f5e7432e7b45ac84dec456ea07325ff5e94319a/detection)\n2018.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nAnalyzing the newly discovered samples introduced us to a larger part of the infrastructure\nutilized by the threat actor, and a common TTP: All the C&C servers were hosted on Vultr servers\nand the domains were registered via the GoDaddy registrar.\n\n\n-----\n\nInfrastructure overview\n\nAs we analyzed this campaign, in addition to the infrastructure used, we also noticed an\ninteresting behavior by the attackers\n\nAt a certain point, the C&C server `95.179.242[.]6 stopped serving the open directory listing.`\nA few days later `dw.adyboh[.]com became an open directory:`\n\nOpen directory listing at dw.adyboh[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nThis might indicate that the attackers are enabling directory listing, when one of their payload\ndelivery servers is in active use.\n\n## Attribution\n\nFrom the malicious document perspective, we believe that the naming scheme for `intel.wll –`\nwhich is dropped by version `7.x of` `RoyalRoad is not enough to make a clear cut attribution,`\nas we observed the same name used by various threat actors dropping different malware families\nsuch as `Bisonal and` `Poison Ivy .`\n\nFrom the payload perspective, on the other hand, once we found the additional related samples\nmentioned in the Hunting section above, we were able to connect it to a known threat group. In\nthe `NWCWorkstation.dll sample mentioned above, we observed a unique string as part of the`\n[logging functionality: “V09SS0lO”. This led us to an article from 2017 by Palo Alto Networks, titles](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-threat-actors-target-government-belarus-using-cmstar-trojan/)\n**Threat Actors Target Government of Belarus, which describes an attack that utilizes a RAT**\nnamed `BYEBY .`\n\n[The article itself also connects to a previous article dating back to 2016, where the same tools](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/digital-quartermaster-scenario-demonstrated-in-attacks-against-the-mongolian-government/)\nwere used in an attack targeting the Mongolian government. The article also explores the\nconnections between these attacks and previous attacks related to the `Enfal Trojan.`\n\nBy comparing the IOCs from the 2017 attack to our campaign we observed several similarities:\n\n### Infrastructure Similarities\n\nThe servers from the 2017 publication were set on the same infrastructure as all the other\nsamples found during our investigation, and utilize Vultr and GoDaddy services.\n\n### Code Similarities\n\nWhen analyzing one of the files from the open directory\n( bf9ef96b9dc8bdbc6996491d8167a8e1e63283fe ), we noticed that it decrypts and loads a DLL\nnamed `wincore.dll . By investigating this dropped file, we were able to make several`\ncorrelations to the `BYEBY sample from 2017:`\n\n1. String similarity:\n\n“BYEBY” strings\n\n\n-----\n\n“wincore.dll” strings\n\n2. Function similarity – Important functions in both `BYEBY and` `wincore.dll have almost`\n\nthe same implementation. One such function is the payloads’ main thread function.\n\nMalware implementation similarities\n\n3. Global Call-Graph and X-Ref Graph – Even though some obfuscation exists in both\n\nsamples, we were able to verify that they have similar call and reference graphs, meaning\nthat the core functionality of the executables is the same.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Payload – In Depth Analysis\n\nTo recap, the second stage payload in the attack chain, is an encrypted DLL file named\n```\nminisdllpub.dll . The DLL, downloaded from 95.179.242[.]6, is a downloader for an\n\n```\nadditional payload. In the following section, we go over its implementation and highlight the\ncharacteristics which are unique to this payload.\n```\nMinisdllpub.dll begins by creating a mutex with the name Afx:DV3ControlHost . This is a\n\n```\nunique indicator that can later be used to hunt for more samples in the wild. It then defines a\nstructure of size `0x5f8 to store system and environment information such as the name of the`\nrunning computer, IP addresses, the username, and OS Version. Next, another structure of size\n```\n0x3FC is created, this time to store pointers to loaded DLLs and API functions, as well as the\n\n```\ncommand and control IP address ( 95.179.242[.]27 ) and port ( 443 ).\n\nAfter setting up these structures, the flow continues and a new thread is created. First, it fetches\nseveral lists of API functions, and dynamically loads them. As can be seen in the following image,\neach list is comprised of the name of a library followed by a sequence of API functions to load\nfrom this library. Pointers to these functions are then added to the previous structure which are\nused to dynamically invoke them when needed.\n\nComma-separated lists of API functions, prepended with the library name\n\nThe second stage payload then sets up HTTP or HTTPS communication, depends on several\nchecks, and starts communicating with its remote control in new threads. When the server replies,\nit sends XOR encoded DLL to the malware, with the key `0x51 .` `Minisdllpub.dll then`\ndecodes the given payload and dynamically loads the new PE to memory.\n\nWhen loaded, it searches for an export function with the name e. The malware then keeps\nlistening to commands from the server, and when those are received, it passes them to the `\"e\"`\nfunction of the newly loaded payload. By doing so, the second-stage is operating as a middleman between the C&C and the final payload – a remote access tool.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware is searching for the export function “e”, in order to invoke it\n\nAt this point, we have a unique layout of modules loaded on the victim’s computer. First, is the\n```\nMinisdllpub.dll that was initially loaded using Rundll32 by http_dll.dll\n\n```\n( intel.wll ) when a Microsoft Office application was executed. Next, we have the RAT payload\nitself which receives its control commands not directly from the C&C, but through\n```\nMinisdllpub.dll that acts as a mediator.\n\n```\nLoader execution flow\n\nInterestingly, in addition to the commands to execute, `Minisdllpub.dll also passes several`\nstructures to the final payload. The structures which were previously built and filled, are now used\nby the RAT to dynamically invoke API functions and deliver data to the C&C server. This unique\napproach of re-using function pointers that were loaded in the previous module makes the\nanalyzing the RAT hardly possible without having the previous stage as well.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe supported functionalities of the final payload, as well as the respective commands it receives\nand sends, are described in the table in Appendix A.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this campaign, we observed the latest iteration of what seems to be a long-running Chinesebased operation against a variety of governments and organizations worldwide. This specific\ncampaign leverages the COVID-19 pandemic to lure victims to trigger the infection chain.\n\nThe attackers updated their toolset from documents with macros and older RTF exploits to the\nlatest variation of the “RoyalRoad” RTF exploit-builder observed in the wild.\n\nThe full intention of this Chinese APT group is still a mystery, but it is clear they are here to stay\nand will update their tools and do whatever it takes to attract new victims to their network.\n\n[Check Point SandBlast Agent protects against this APT attack, and prevents it from the very first](https://www.checkpoint.com/products/advanced-endpoint-protection/)\nsteps.\n\n**Appendix A: RAT Module – Supported Commands**\n\n\n### Command ID (Sent from C&C)\n\n\n### Sub Com‐ mand ID (Sent from C&C)\n\n\n### Description Response ID (Sent from Bot)\n\n\n### 0x21 Write a file to a specified path.
