From April through June of 2020, we saw\nwaves of Valak malware two to four times a week on average through an email distribution\nnetwork nicknamed Shathak or TA551. Characteristics of Valak include:\n\n[Valak relies on scheduled tasks and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005/) [Windows registry updates to remain persistent on](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/)\nan infected Windows host.\nValak uses [Alternate Data Stream (ADS) as a technique to run follow-up malware on](https://www.sans.org/blog/alternate-data-streams-overview/)\nan infected host\n\n\n-----\n\nRecent Valak infections show an increase in obfuscated code for configuration scripts\nused during the infection, possibly as an attempt to avoid detection.\nSince April 2020, we have seen a great deal of Valak malware distributed by an actor\nsometimes referred to as Shathak/TA551.\n\nThis blog covers the history of Valak, reviews the chain of events for an infection, examines\ntraffic generated by Valak and explores recent updates in obfuscation techniques used by the\nmalware in order to evade detection. This blog also examines the Shathak/TA551 distribution\nsystem that has been consistently pushing Valak since April 2020.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from Valak by our Threat Prevention\nsubscription for the Next-Generation Firewall.\n\n## Valak History\n\nThe earliest public record of Valak comes from Proofpoint's ET Pro ruleset, where two rules\ndetecting Valak were introduced on October 22, 2019, for the Suricata Open Source threat\ndetection engine.\n\n[Valak was documented as follow-up malware during an Ursnif infection (also known as Gozi](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/12/19/index.html)\n[or IFSB) on December 19, 2019. Analysis by Cybereason revealed Valak used a](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/valak-more-than-meets-the-eye)\ncombination of techniques to remain persistent on an infected Windows host. Valak relies on\nscheduled tasks combined with Windows registry updates. It also uses Alternate Data\nStream (ADS) during the infection process for follow-up malware.\n\nMost examples of Valak in recent months have been distributed through malicious spam\n(malspam). SentinelLabs (SentinelOne) published a report providing further information\nabout Valak, including a connection between Valak malware distribution and campaigns\nsimilar to the “Gozi ConfCrew.” Distribution characteristics were further explored in a Threat\nSpotlight on Valak published by Talos (Cisco).\n\n[The distribution network using malspam to push Valak has been called Shathak on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/luc4m/status/1265194192768315392)\n[Shathak has been attributed to an actor named TA551 on the Malware Don’t Need Coffee](https://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/refs/actors/ta551/)\nblog.\n\n## Chain of Events\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Chain of events for recent Valak malware activity.\nFigure 1 shows the chain of events seen for Valak infections in June and early July 2020. For\na Windows computer to become infected, a victim must:\n\nOpen malspam with password-protected ZIP attachment. On June 30 and July 1, 2020,\nwe saw indications there may also have been a link to download a ZIP archive instead\nof an attachment.\nExtract Microsoft Word document from the password-protected ZIP archive using a\nunique password from the message text.\nOpen the Word document as shown below in Figure 2 and enable macros.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Example of a Microsoft Word document from June 24, 2020, with macros for Valak.\nFor Valak infections during June 2020, the initial activity consisted of:\n\nAn HTTP or HTTPS URL ending with .cab that returned a DLL to install Valak.\nValak DLL was saved to the C:\\ProgramData\\ directory using a random file name,\nusually with a .dat or .jpg file extension, as shown in Figure 3.\nValak DLL was run using regsvr32.exe -s [filename]\nPopup message stating the DLL was successfully run, as shown in Figure 4.\nA JavaScript configuration file appeared as a random file name (always the same\nname for each wave of infections) under the C:\\Users\\Public\\ directory, as shown in\nFigures 5 and 6.\nInitial HTTP command and control (C2) traffic returned encoded ASCII text used to\ncreate additional malware/artifacts for the infection.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Initial Valak DLL retrieved after enabling macros on the Word document from\nFigure 2.\n\nFigure 4. Pop-up message on a Windows 10 host when an initial Valak DLL was successfully\nrun using RegSvr32.exe after macros were enabled on June 24, 2020.\n\nFigure 5. Initial script file in C:\\Users\\Public\\ directory used during Valak infection from June\n24, 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Contents of the JavaScript configuration file from June 24, 2020.\nFigure 6 reveals variable names are obfuscated in the JavaScript configuration file. This is\nan example of obfuscation that we have noted since June 2020, and it is covered in more\ndetail later in this blog when discussing Valak developments.\n\nAs the infection progressed, three things happened near-simultaneously to make Valak\npersistent on an infected Windows host:\n\nA Windows executable (EXE) appeared in the infected user's AppData\\Local\\Temp\ndirectory as a random file name ending in .bin (PE32 executable, Mono/.Net\nassembly), as shown in Figure 7.\nWindows registry entries were created under the key for\nHKCU\\SOFTWARE\\ApplicationContainer\\Appsw64\nA randomly-named text file and JavaScript (JS) file both appeared under the\nC:\\Users\\Public\\ directory, as shown in Figures 8, 9 and 10.\nA scheduled task was created to run the JS file located under C:\\Users\\Public\\ and\nrepeat running it every four minutes, as shown in Figure 11.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. EXE file with a .bin file extension from the June 24, 2020, Valak infection.\n\nFigure 8. Additional artifacts in the C:\\Users\\Public\\ directory created during the infection.\n\nFigure 9. Contents of the text file, a random string of text.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Contents of the JS file used to keep the Valak infection persistent.\n\nFigure 11. Scheduled task for JS file used to keep the Valak infection persistent.\nIf the C2 domains remained active during the infection, as early as four minutes later, we saw\nfollow-up malware:\n\nValak C2 traffic returned encoded ASCII text used to create a follow-up malware EXE.\nThe follow-up malware EXE was appended to the randomly-named text file in\nC:\\Users\\Public using ADS, as shown in Figure 12.\nA scheduled task was created to run the follow-up malware EXE once, shortly after it\nwas created, as shown in Figure 13.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. Text file in C:\\Users\\Public\\ directory updated with ADS.\n\nFigure 13. Scheduled task to run the follow-up malware.\nIn our tests, running Valak from a U.S. location on a vulnerable Windows 10 host returned a\n[banking Trojan called IcedID as the follow-up malware. In one case, we saw both IcedID and](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.icedid)\n[NetSupport Manager RAT-based malware delivered as follow-up malware on a Windows 7](https://threatpost.com/netsupport-manager-rat-nortonlifelock-docs/153387/)\nhost [from June 2020.](https://twitter.com/malware_traffic/status/1276640971367776259)\n\n## Valak Infection Traffic\n\nThe infection starts when a victim enables macros on one of the malicious documents. This\nusually generates a URL ending with .cab that returns a Windows DLL file. Figure 14 shows\n[a Valak infection from June 24, 2020, filtered in Wireshark to list the HTTP requests and](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2020/06/24/index.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nother web-based traffic. The first line shows a URL that ends with .cab. A TCP stream of this\nactivity is shown in Figure 15, and it reveals signs of an EXE or DLL file returned from the\nserver.\n\nFigure 14. Traffic from a Valak infection with IcedID as the follow-up malware from June 2020\nfiltered in Wireshark.\n\nFigure 15. TCP stream for the HTTP GET request ending in .cab that returned a Windows\nDLL file.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Checking the binary in VirusTotal shows this file is a DLL. This DLL is an installer for Valak.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0f0d870fcad3e935d191e4076bfdc3812c278c3bdb6ec2233d71d9cf14a04a17/)\nShortly after the initial HTTP traffic for the Valak DLL, we see other HTTP GET requests\nstarting with:\n\nlicense.jsp?client=\narchive.jsp?page=\ndb.aspx?dfc=\n\nThe HTTP requests are Valak C2 traffic, which is sent to decoy domains (non-malicious\ndomains from legitimate organizations) and malicious domains. These domains are listed in\nthe initial Valak script previously shown in Figure 5. For example, for Valak infections from\nthe June 24, 2020, wave, the decoy domains were:\n\ne87.dspb.akamaidege.net\ninsiderppe.cloudapp.net\npagead46.l.doubleclick.net\n\nAlso noted in Figure 5 are the malicious domains from the June 24, 2020, wave of Valak:\n\nthepicklepilot.com\njoonaskallinen.com\nxfitnessproducts.com\n\nFigure 5 also shows three additional domains from the June 24, 2020, wave of Valak. These\ndomains appear to be fake or possibly placeholders because they were not registered and\ndid not resolve to any IP address.\n\n59xidd-fuel.com\n19geds-space.com\n55sfors-cask.com\n\nValak C2 traffic returns data as encoded ASCII text that is decoded on the victim host and\nsaved as malware items like script files, EXE used during the infection and data for registry\nupdates for the Valak infection. Figure 16 shows an example of this traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16. Valak C2 over HTTP traffic returning ASCII data used to create malware items on\nthe victim host.\nIn addition to HTTP GET requests, Valak uses HTTP POST requests to exfiltrate certain\ntypes of data. In Figures 17 and 18, we see an HTTP POST request starting with\nclass4.aspx?internalService= that sends login credentials used for Microsoft Outlook from an\ninfected Windows host.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17. Valak infection traffic filtered in Wireshark showing an HTTP POST request from\nthe C2 traffic.\n\nFigure 18. TCP stream of the HTTP POST request showing a base64 string containing\nOutlook login credentials of the infected host.\nWe primarily see IcedID as follow-up malware from the Valak infections generated from U.S.\nlocations. Figure 19 shows indicators of IcedID during the Valak infection traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19. Indicators of IcedID as the follow-up malware during this Valak infection.\n\n## Recent Developments\n\nAs Valak has developed, we have noticed increased obfuscation in the Valak configuration\nscript. This obfuscation finds its way into other script and Windows registry updates used to\nkeep the infection persistent. Figure 20 shows configuration script from June 23, 2020, using\nValak software version 40. Figure 21 shows configuration script from June 24, 2020, using\nValak software version 41. Note how variable names and some of the values were\nobfuscated when Valak changed from version 40 to version 41.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20. Valak version 40 configuration script with variable names and values in plain text.\n\nFigure 21. Valak version 41 configuration script with variable names and some values using\nobfuscated text.\n\n\n-----\n\nLike most obfuscation, this is likely an attempt to evade detection. As the weeks and months\nprogress, we predict further obfuscation in Valak’s configuration script and related files.\n\n## Shathak/TA551 Distribution\n\nShathak or TA551 is the name some security researchers have given to a specific\ndistribution method that uses password-protected ZIP archives as attachments to malspam.\n[The distribution network may be associated with Russian cybercriminals. It has used Word](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/valak-more-than-meets-the-eye#Relationship-Other-Malware)\ndocument templates targeting English-, Italian-, German- and Japanese-speaking recipients.\nShathak/TA551 has been active at least as early as February 2019.\n\nShathak/TA551 distribution has the following characteristics:\n\nMalspam spoofs legitimate email chains based on mailbox data retrieved from\npreviously-infected Windows hosts. It sends copies of these email chains to senders\nand recipients from the original email chain.\nThe spoofed email chain includes a short message as the most recent item in the\nchain. This item is a generic message that instructs recipients to open an attached ZIP\narchive using a supplied password.\nThe password-protected ZIP attachments contain a Microsoft Word document with\n[macros to install malware. See Appendix A for examples of these Word documents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pan-unit42/iocs/master/Valak/2020-June-SHA256-hashes-of-Word-docs-from-Shathak-TA551-distribution.txt)\nfrom June 2020.\nThe macros usually generate a URL ending in .cab to retrieve a binary that installs\n[malware. This binary is currently a DLL file. Appendix B lists examples of URLs from](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0f0d870fcad3e935d191e4076bfdc3812c278c3bdb6ec2233d71d9cf14a04a17/)\nthis campaign.\nPrior to April 2020, the most common malware caused by Word documents associated\nwith Shathak/TA551 was Ursnif.\nSince April 2020, the most common malware distributed by these Word documents has\n[been Valak. Appendix C lists a series of Valak DLL examples from June 2020.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pan-unit42/iocs/master/Valak/2020-June-SHA256-hashes-of-Valak-DLL-files-from-Shathak-TA551-distribution.txt)\nSince May 2020, passwords used for the ZIP attachments appear to be unique to each\nrecipient.\n\nTo get an idea of traffic patterns associated with Shathak/TA551, recent examples of URLs\ngenerated by the associated Word macros follow (Read: Date - URL).\n\n2020-05-26 - hxxp://c1j4xptyujjpyt8[.]com/gg88wyaftcxr7gu/wo0zz.php?l=sfzs9.cab\n2020-05-27 - hxxp://ft23fpcu5yabw2[.]com/alfh/xzrn.php?l=lfahe9.cab\n2020-06-03 - hxxp://awh93dhkylps5ulnq-be[.]com/czwih/fxla.php?l=gap1.cab\n2020-06-09 - hxxp://a4zy33hbmhxx70w9q[.]com/hdil/kzex.php?l=soub12.cab\n2020-06-10 - hxxp://kzex9vp0jfw6a8up1[.]com/hdil/kzex.php?l=phin1.cab\n2020-06-22 - hxxp://5u2mr[.]com/unbbmevd/d76.php?l=oev1.cab\n2020-06-23 - hxxp://fepz41[.]com/unbbmevd/d76.php?l=ynetz11.cab\n2020-06-24 - hxxp://mbzrrt[.]com/unbbmevd/d76.php?l=ftywl4.cab\n2020-06-26 - hxxp://ofxvp[.]com/unbbmevd/d76.php?l=wozmbl9.cab\n\n\n-----\n\n2020-07-06 - hxxp://eto9ve1[.]com/iz5/yaca.php?l=tze7.cab\n\nAs noted previously, [Appendix B provides more examples of these URLs generated by Word](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0f0d870fcad3e935d191e4076bfdc3812c278c3bdb6ec2233d71d9cf14a04a17/)\nmacros associated with Shathak/TA551.\n\nFigures 22-30 provide screenshots with selected examples of malspam and the extracted\nWord documents associated with Shathak/TA551.

Shathak/TA551 malspam to a German-speaking recipient from May 26, 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis distribution network has generally pushed Ursnif in previous years, but since late April\n2020, we’ve most often seen Valak from Shathak/TA551. In some cases, we still see Ursnif\nfrom this distribution, which recently happened on June 10, 2020, and July 7, 2020.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs we enter the second half of 2020, Valak shows no signs of slowing down. We expect to\nsee further waves of malspam from Shathak/TA551 distribution pushing Word documents\nwith macros for Valak.\n\nDue to its complex infection process that relies in part on registry updates with malware\ncode, Valak can easily infect an unprotected Windows host. With ADS used to hide follow-up\nmalware from a Valak infection, the risk is greatly increased.\n\nHowever, security best practices like running fully patched and up-to-date versions of\nMicrosoft Windows will hinder or prevent Valak infections. Palo Alto Networks customers are\nfurther protected from Valak by our Threat Prevention subscription for the Next-Generation\nFirewall.
