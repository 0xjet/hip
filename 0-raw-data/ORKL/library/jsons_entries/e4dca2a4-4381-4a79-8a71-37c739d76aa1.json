At the time, the learning curve for understanding\nits functionality was rather steep and analysis required specific knowledge of a\nmanufacturer's ATM API functions and parameters, which were not publicly documented.\n\nBefore the discovery of Skimer, anti-malware researchers' considered ATMs secure\nmachines containing proprietary hardware, running non-standard operating systems, and\nimplementing a number of advanced protection techniques designed to prevent attacks using\nmalicious code. Researchers eventually discovered that the most popular ATM\nmanufacturers use a standard Windows operating system and add on some auxiliary\ndevices, such as a safe and card reader.\n\nOver time, actors behind some of the newer ATM malware families such as GreenDispenser\n[and Tyupkin realized that there is a generic Windows extension for Financial Services API](https://www.cen.eu/work/areas/ICT/eBusiness/Pages/WS-XFS.aspx)\n(CEN/XFS) that can be used to make malware that runs independent of the underlying\nhardware platform, as long as the ATM manufacturer supports the framework. This malware\ncan trick the machines into dispensing cash, regardless of whether the attacker has a\nlegitimate bank card.\n\n\n-----\n\nATM malware has evolved to include a number of different families and different actors\nbehind them, ranging from criminal groups to actors affiliated with nation states. The\nsignificance of ATM malware stems from the fact that it can bring significant financial benefits\nto attackers and as a consequence cause a significant damage to targeted banks, financial\ninstitutions and end users.\n\nNow that this type of malware has been around for more than 10 years, we wanted to round\nup the specific families we've seen during that time and attempt to find out if the different\nfamilies share any code.\n\n## ATM malware overview\n\n**Significance**\n\nATM malware provided criminals with a subtler alternative to physically breaking into the safe\nbuilt into the ATM. Before the appearance of ATM malware, criminals typically had to employ\ntraditional ways of robbing ATMs, often pulling the physical device out of the ground or\nblowing it to pieces with dynamite. Obviously, these methods would quickly draw the\nattention of law enforcement and passersby.\n\nOver the past 10 years, we have seen a steady increase in the number of ATM malware\nsamples discovered. Still, the number of discovered samples is very small compared to\nalmost any other malware category.\n\n_Number of ATM malware samples discovered year over year based on the year of first_\n_submission to VirusTotal._\n\n\n-----\n\nAs a digital substitute for dynamite, ATM malware allows criminals to employ money mules\nand instruct them how to dispense money from targeted ATMs. Typically, it happens by\nsupplying a special authorisation code or card created to authorise the transaction.\n\nBefore that, criminals had to infect the targeted ATM to install the code, which more often\nthan not meant that they had to physically open the device to access its optical media\nreading devices or USB ports.\n\nThere have been many reported attacks on various banking organizations throughout the\nworld, but they seem to be more prevalent in Latin America and Eastern Europe, where the\nATM infrastructure is older and are not regularly updated with security software or tamperproof sensors. The damage caused by ATM malware to banks and individuals is rarely\ndisclosed but it likely reaches millions of dollars a year.\n\nATM malware affects banks and other financial institutions, as well as the reputation of ATM\nmanufacturers and individuals and companies whose account details are stolen in ATM\nmalware attacks.\n\n**Classification**\n\nThere are several different ways we can classify ATM malware families. Based on its\nfunctionality, we can classify ATM malware into virtual skimmers and cash dispensers. The\npurpose of skimmers is to steal card and transaction details and individual PINs if the\nencryption keys used by pin pad are successfully retrieved.\n\nCash-dispensing malware uses functions to allow for so-called \"jackpotting\" of ATMs where\nmoney is dispensed by attackers without the authorisation from the bank. But there are\nmalware families that can steal card details and dispense cash.\n\nAs far as the installation process is concerned, we again have two major groups. The first\none requires the attacker to physically access the device. The second group assumes that\nthe attacker installs malware indirectly, typically by compromising the internal network of the\nbank and then targeting ATMs using stolen credentials.\n\nThese types of malware will also either target specific models of ATMs, or will be more\ngeneric. Recently, ATM malware typically deploys generic functions.\n\nThe most common framework is the CEN/XFS framework, which allows the developers of\nthe ATM applications to compile and run their code regardless of the ATM model or the\nmanufacturer but there are others, such as Kalignite framework built on top of XFS.\n\nThe XFS API contains high-level functions for communicating with the various ATM modules\nsuch as the cash dispensing module (CDM), PIN pad (EPP4) or printer. The high-level\nfunctions are provided through a generic SDK, while the lower level functions, supplied\n\n\n-----\n\nthrough service providers, are developed by ATM manufacturers. The architecture is quite\nsimilar to Win32 architecture where the developers use the high-level API to communicate\nwith the OS kernel and various device drivers provided by the manufacturers of the individual\nhardware components.\n\n_High-level CEN/XFS architecture._\n\nMost ATM samples require physical access to the targeted ATM. ATMs are not typically\nconnected to the internet and communicate with bank's central systems through specialized\nlines. However, most of the ATMs are connected to internal networks for their maintenance\nand administration so the second, smaller group of ATM malware may be introduced by\ncompromising the internal network first. This technique requires a higher level of\nsophistication but potentially brings higher returns if successful.\n\n[Some generic hacking tools, such as Cobalt Strike, have reportedly been used for attacking](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/07/multiple-cobalt-personality-disorder.html)\nATMs and the transaction systems. This method has been more commonly used by more\nadvanced groups such as Carbanak, Cobalt Gang and Lazarus (Group 77), whose Fastcash\nattack affects IBM AIX operating system, which is rarely targeted by malware.\n\n**Notable ATM malware families and their functionality**\n\nOver the past 10 years, we have seen more than 30 different ATM malware families. In this\nsection, we will briefly describe some of the more notable ones.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Number of ATM malware samples per family._\n\n**Ploutus**\n\n[Ploutus is the malware family with the largest number of discovered samples. The majority of](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/atm-malware-variants/ploutus)\nthem having been reported in Mexico. Ploutus is a standard ATM-dispensing malware. The\nattackers need to be able to access physical ports or a CD-ROM drive to be able to boot\nfrom it and modify the ATM system image to install the malware.\n\nAttackers allegedly used newer Ploutus variants to attack some U.S.-based ATMs. Ploutus.D\n[communicates with the ATM using the multi-vendor KAL Kalignite framework, which allows it](https://www.kal.com/en/kal-products)\nto work with ATMs from different vendors with minimal changes to its code base.\n\n\n-----\n\n_One of the Ploutus variant's interface._\n\n**Skimer**\n\n[Skimer is one of the first ATM attacks, and bears all of the features of well-developed](http://blog.threatexpert.com/2009/03/effect-of-credit-crunch-on-backdoors.html)\nmalware. Skimer functions as a virtual skimming device that attempts to steal bank card\nnumbers and details of the account and owner details stored on the magnetic stripe tracks 1\nand 2. A recent review of its functionality also indicates that it may also attempt to steal\nusers' PINs by retrieving the encrypted pin pad encryption keys from the system.\n\nApart from the virtual skimming function, Skimer acts as a backdoor to the ATM functionality\nfor its operators — money mules employed to collect stolen data and dispense cash.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Main code loop for servicing Skimer's operators with cash._\n\nIf the user knows the secret code to activate the backdoor, the malware displays a menu,\nwhich allows the operator to empty one of the four cash-dispensing modules (CDMs).\n\n_The code locking the dispenser module and dispensing cash._\n\nMost of the other ATM malware families follow a similar principle. The attackers need to be\nable to physically access the ATM, which requires a key or drilling a hole to access specific\n\n\n-----\n\nports or devices. Once the malware is deployed, the money mules need a specific code to\naccess the menu and dispense cash.\n\n**Tyupkin (Padpin)**\n\n[The most interesting characteristic of Tyupkin is that it has the ability to limit its operation to](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2016/01/07/atm-hacking-arrests-tyupkin/)\nspecific hours and days of the week. It was reported that some Tyupkin instances can only\nbe used on Sundays and Mondays at night.\n\n_Tyupkin function for checking the hours of operation._\n\nBefore dispensing cash, Tyupkin disables any network connections, presumably to prevent\nadministrators from shutting down the ATM if a suspicious activity is detected.\n\nSome members of Tyupkin family are developed using C# and the .NET framework and\nsome using Microsoft Visual C++. The family uses XFS API to manage infected ATMs and\ndispense cash in multiple currencies. Tyupkin has been active since 2014 and the associated\ngangs reportedly target Eastern European countries.\n\n**Alice**\n\n[Alice follows a similar pattern to other ATM malware. It is installed by attackers and requires](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/atm-malware-variants/alice)\nphysical access to the system. When the operator launches it, Alice displays a window\nrequiring a PIN.\n\n\n-----\n\n_First Alice screen._\n\nIf the code is correct, Alice will access the dispenser module and allow the operator to\nretrieve cash.\n\n_Main Alice UI window._\n\n**Cutlet**\n\n[Cutlet, or Cutlet Maker, has been sold as a do-it-yourself ATM malware kit on some](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/atm-malware-variants/cutletmaker)\nunderground markets since 2016. The bundle contains detailed instructions in Russian and\nEnglish on how to infect systems and how to acquire codes required to dispense cash.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Main Cutlet Maker user interface._\n\nThe Cutlet manual details operational security practices required to avoid being caught by\nlaw enforcement officers and shows where to drill holes in the ATM enclosure in order to\naccess USB ports of a specific ATM model. The kit also contains a testing application named\n\"Stimulator\" for users to practice before they decide to conduct real attacks.\n\nCutlet follows a similar pattern to the previous ATM malware. The owner of the kit has the\nability to generate codes per ATM required for its operation.\n\n**Fastcash**\n[The significance of Fastcash malware is its mode of operation and its targeting of IBM AIX](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-275A)\noperating system. [Fastcash consists of a process injector and shared objects presumably](https://github.com/fboldewin/FastCashMalwareDissected/blob/master/Operation%2520Fast%2520Cash%2520-%2520Hidden%2520Cobra%25E2%2580%2598s%2520AIX%2520PowerPC%2520malware%2520dissected.pdf)\ninjected into the process space of compromised bank payment authorization systems. The\n[malware monitors ISO8583-based transactions using code from a fairly old open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8583)\n[library for parsing ISO8583 packets.](https://github.com/sabit/Oscar-ISO8583)\n\nIf an ATM transaction contains the attackers' codes, the data will not be forwarded to the\noriginal payment authorisation application and the transaction approval will be sent back to\nthe target ATM system allowing attackers to dispense cash.\n\nThis mode of operation is similar to some rootkits, where malware attempts to hide its\npresence on the system by modifying the responses sent back from the operating system to\nthe application that attempts to list system objects such as files or processes. The returned\nlist is usually modified to remove names of processes that belong to the malware.\n\nFastcash has been attributed to the Lazarus Group and it is an example of a nation-staterelated actor targeting financial systems for the attacker's financial benefit. Fastcash shows a\nlevel of sophistication and knowledge that is not seen in other, run-of-the-mill, ATM malware.\n\n**Code sharing between families**\n\n\n-----\n\nThanks to [Xylitol and the](https://twitter.com/Xylit0l) [ATM Cybercrime tracker, it was easy to retrieve a fairly complete](http://atm.cybercrime-tracker.net/)\nATM malware data set, with the addition of the few files connected with the Fastcash\ncampaign.\n\nThe data set contains 121 files and it is well suited for analysis and clustering. Out of 121\nfiles, there are 114 PE files and those were used for clustering using the static analysis\ntechniques. Out of 114 PE files there were 37 packed files which may not be suitable for\nstatic analysis techniques and 20 DLLs.\n\nWhile investigating various methods for clustering, we stumbled upon an interesting book,\n[\"Malware Data Science\" by Joshua Saxe and Hillary Sanders. This book shows basic and](https://www.malwaredatascience.com/)\nmore advanced methods for classifying and clustering malicious files and used some of the\nideas to cluster our own set.\n\nIn our case, the clustering was conducted by extracting the following attributes of each\nsample:\n\nStrings extracted from the file\nDisassembled code from the entry point of the file\nFile entropy and the presence of a known packer\nImported or exported functions\nEmbedded resources\n\nAfter collecting the attributes from each sample, Jaccard distance is calculated for every pair\nof the files in the set. The Jaccard index is a measure of similarity between two sets. The\nmore similar the two samples are, the higher their Jaccard index will be. The index is a\nnumber between 0 and 1. For example, the Jaccard index of 0.5 indicates 50 percent overlap\nbetween the two sets.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Clusters with Jaccard index threshold of 0.7._\n\nWe need to set the threshold required for two samples to be connected as a part of a single\ncluster. The higher the Jaccard threshold we choose, the more related will be the members\nof the defined cluster. By varying the threshold we come to the optimal value for our purpose.\nFor example, for correct classification of samples we should choose the value higher than\n0.7, and for code sharing purposes, higher than 0.3.\n\nAs expected, the results show that as we lower the thresholds we see more clusters appear\nand some of the clusters show overlap between distinct ATM malware families.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Clusters with Jaccard index threshold of 0.3._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe width of the lines in the graph show how strongly the files in the clusters are related. For\nexample, we see that the members of individual GreenDispenser, Tyupkin or DispCash\nclusters are very closely related, while mixed Ligsterac/Skimer, Tyupkin/Dispcash and\nATMtest/Helloworld clusters show weaker connections that likely indicate some overlap in\nthe malware code.\n\n## Protection and detection best practices\n\nWhen considering protection and detection of attacks with ATM malware, it is important to\nconsider the physical security of ATMs, the security of software running on the system and\nthe security of any segment of the organization's network that communicates with ATMs.\n\nHere are 15 best practices that organizations should follow when considering protection of\nATMs networks and successful and timely detection of attacks when they happen.\n\nEnsure ATMs and all related systems run up-to-date software and the latest operating\nsystem versions with the latest security patches applied.\nDisable Windows AutoPlay and configure BIOS to disable the ability to boot software\nfrom USB sticks and CD/DVD drives. Set strong BIOS password protection to prevent\nboot settings from being changed.\nDisable access to the Windows desktop at the ATM, ensure RDP sessions are secured\nwith multiple authentication factors such as Duo Authentication for Windows Logon and\nRDP.\nRemove any unused services and applications from the system to reduce the attack\nsurface. Implement other measures to harden the underlying ATM operating system.\nMonitor the operation of ATMs, as well as their physical integrity. Look for unusual\npatterns of resets, communication failures and transaction volume.\nImplement strong encryption between the ATM and the host.\nEnsure access to the ATM cabinet is restricted to authorized persons and that such\naccess is electronically logged.\nPerform a security assessment of ATMs, including their physical locations and any\nnetworks connecting to them.\nEnsure that firewalls and anti-malware protection are correctly configured.\nConfigure whitelisting solutions or operating system features to allow only known,\ntrusted software to run. Make sure that whitelisting cannot be disabled without\ngenerating a remote log entry.\nPrevent unauthorized USB devices from being installed using a device control function.\nEducate employees about how they can avoid introducing malware into operational\nsystems.\nMaintain a physically and logically segmented network environment throughout the\n[organization using segmentation technology such as Cisco TrustSec.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/trustsec/index.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nEnsure visibility over network traffic to ATM systems and payment authorisation servers\nusing technology that enhance network visibility, such as [Cisco Stealthwatch.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/stealthwatch/index.html)\nMonitor threat intelligence feeds to learn about newly detected ATM malware threats.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nATM malware is a niche area attacks, but it potentially brings significant benefits to actors\nthat successfully manage to deploy it. Over 10 years since the discovery of the first\nspecialized malicious code targeting the Diebold Agilis line of ATMs, we have seen over 30\nother malware families with varying degrees of sophistication, complexity and success. Most\nof the successful attacks are reported in countries where the ATMs are older, such as some\nLatin American countries and Eastern Europe.\n\nWhile the majority of actors behind ATM malware seem to be less sophisticated criminal\nactors, the potential of being able to dispense large amounts of cash also attracts more\nsophisticated criminal groups such as Carbanak and Cobalt Gang, as well as some statesponsored actors such as Lazarus.\n\nAlthough the number of known malware samples for ATMs has been very low there has been\na steady increase in the trendline for number of discovered samples year over year.\n\nFinancial organizations and banks have to be particularly vigilant when considering\nprotection against malware for ATMs and payment systems. Enterprises and individuals may\nalso experience financial loss due to potential of their card details being used for illegal\ntransactions after being skimmed by ATM malware. Best practices should be followed to\nensure the highest possible level of protection and organizations should invest into\nincreasing user awareness about the dangers of ATM malware.\n\n## Coverage\n\nAdditional ways our customers can detect and block these threats are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the](http://cs.co/reviewamp)\nmalware used by these threat actors.
