What makes](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2020/12/fireeye-shares-details-of-recent-cyber-attack-actions-to-protect-community.html)\nthis attack unique is not only the target, FireEye being a well-known cybersecurity company,\nbut that the stolen data contains the internal, custom-crafted red-team and penetration\ntesting tools used by the company to imitate different threat actors during customer security\n[consultations. FireEye’s blog provided a wealth of information for defenders to implement](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/unauthorized-access-of-fireeye-red-team-tools.html)\nsecurity controls and mitigations for defense against the stolen tools. This data is being used\nby Palo Alto Networks to help ensure our customers are protected if the attackers choose to\nutilize the tools for malicious purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is important to note that these custom tools were not released into the wild, they were\nstolen by a sophisticated threat actor and we likely will not see a sudden widespread use of\nthem. That being said, FireEye went beyond what was required – and what companies have\n[done in the past – in releasing detection techniques. Providing defenders access to the Yara](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/)\n[rules, indicators of compromise (IOCs), Snort signatures and other threat data is a class act](https://www.snort.org/)\nand very much appreciated by defenders and researchers at Palo Alto Networks – and\nsurely across the industry as a whole.\n\n## Protecting Our Customers\n\nPalo Alto Networks has been working diligently to ensure the protections released by\nFireEye are implemented in a timely manner. The [Github repository shared by FireEye](https://github.com/fireeye/red_team_tool_countermeasures)\ncontains a list of rules and 16 vulnerability CVE identifiers. The vulnerabilities appear to have\nbeen included because sufficient protections against these can help limit the effectiveness of\nthe red-team tools.\n\nPalo Alto Networks has ensured the protections within our products are either already in\nplace or are being prioritized for the provided vulnerabilities and their exploitation. These\nvulnerabilities range from a wide variety of products, and as always, we highly recommend\nour customers stay current with their updates and patch all vulnerable software.\n\nThe Github repository that provided the protections also contains rules for direct product\nimplementation as well as hunting. Palo Alto Networks is analyzing the efficacy of and\napplying all stable rules to our respective products. Gap analysis and threat hunting\nleveraging the FireEye-provided Yara and Snort signatures have enabled Palo Alto Networks\nresearchers to identify potential malware samples that we are now tagging, analyzing,\n[tracking and building protections around within WildFire. Continual verdict efficacy checks of](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire)\nidentified malware samples is ongoing within Palo Alto Networks products. Customers\n[leveraging the Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus tool can track initially identified samples and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/autofocus)\n[tools under the Fireye_RedTeam_Tools,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.FireEye_RedTeam_Tools) [Rubeus,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Rubeus) [AndrewSpecial,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.AndrewSpecial) [KeeFarce,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.KeeFarce) [SafetyKatz,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.SafetyKatz)\n[InveighZero,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.InveighZero) [GadgetToJScript,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.GadgetToJScript) [SeatBelt,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.SeatBelt) [RuralBishop,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.RuralBishop) [SharpView, and](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.SharpView) [SharpZeroLogon](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.SharpZeroLogon)\ntags. Our Cortex [XDR Managed Threat Hunting Team (MTH) has proactively searched all](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/managed-threat-hunting)\nCortex XDR Pro customer logs to identify potentially impacted organizations and provide\nthem an assessment of their risk.\n\n[Cortex XDR customers are protected using the product’s WildFire integration as well as](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr/cortex-xdr-pro-admin/endpoint-security/endpoint-security-concepts/endpoint-protection-modules.html)\nthrough Local Analysis, the Password theft prevention module, and the behavioral threat\nprotection (BTP) engine. In addition, multiple Behavioural Indicators of Compromise (BIOCs)\nare available in XDR Server to detect malicious techniques exhibited by the stolen tools.\n\n[Threat Prevention provides protection against command and control beacons and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/threat-prevention)\nexploitation of network vulnerabilities used by the stolen tools.

Palo Alto Networks appreciates the information\ndisclosure from FireEye, but we also want to emphasize that at the time this report is\npublished, the tools, hashes of the tools and associated samples have not been disclosed to\nthe public. From the perspective of Palo Alto Networks security researchers, the biggest\nthreat from this breach is the actor and the techniques they were able to utilize in order to\ninfiltrate the FireEye infrastructure. Currently, there has not been any information released on\nthe breach or the threat actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Customers\nshould know that Palo Alto Networks researchers are working diligently to ensure protections\nare in place for our entire product ecosystem.\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
