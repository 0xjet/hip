Xtreme\nRAT is a publicly available remote access tool that has been around for few years and has\nbeen used by threat actors in cybercrime as well as targeted attacks. In this threat advisory\nwe will discuss its network and host behavior from the perspective of RSA NetWitness\nPackets and RSA NetWitness Endpoint.\n\n[The delivery document documentos.doc looks to be targeting Spanish-speaking users.
