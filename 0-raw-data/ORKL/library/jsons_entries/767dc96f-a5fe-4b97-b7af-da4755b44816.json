    "plain_text": "# On the StrongPity Waterhole Attacks Targeting Italian and Belgian Encryption Users\n\n#### By Kurt Baumgartner on October 3, 2016. 11:40 pm\n\n[INCIDENTS](https://securelist.com/all?category=22) [RESEARCH](https://securelist.com/all?category=24)\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/all?tag=538) [CYBER ESPIONAGE](https://securelist.com/all?tag=185) [SOCIAL ENGINEERING](https://securelist.com/all?tag=29) [TARGETED ATTACKS](https://securelist.com/all?tag=53)\n\n[WATERING HOLE](https://securelist.com/all?tag=810) [WEBSITE HACKS](https://securelist.com/all?tag=58)\n\n### Kurt Baumgartner\n\nPrincipal Security Researcher, GReAT\n\n\n[@k_sec](http://twitter.com/k_sec)\n\n\nThe StrongPity APT is a technically capable group operating\n\nunder the radar for several years. The group has quietly deployed\n\nzero­day in the past, effectively spearphished targets, and\n\nmaintains a modular toolset. What is most interesting about this\n\ngroup’s more recent activity however, is their focus on users of\n\nencryption tools, peaking this summer. In particular, the focus was\n\non Italian and Belgian users, but the StrongPity watering holes\n\naffected systems in far more locations than just those two. Adding\n\nin their creative waterholing and poisoned installer tactics, we\n\ndescribe the StrongPity APT as not only determined and well­\n\nresourced, but fairly reckless and innovative as well.\n\n# Encryption Tools\n\nClearly this APT is interested in encrypted data and\n\ncommunications. The tools targeted by this group enable\n\npractices for securing secrecy and integrity of data. For example,\n\nWinRAR packs and encrypts files with strong suites like AES­256,\n\nand TrueCrypt encrypts full hard drives all in one swoop. Both\n\nWinRAR and TrueCrypt help provide strong and reliable\n\n\n-----\n\nkey. And, TrueCrypt provides an effective open­source full disk\n\nencryption solution for Windows, Apple, Linux, and Android\n\nsystems. Using both of these tools together, a sort of one off,\n\npoor man’s end­to­end encryption can be maintained for free by\n\nputting these two solutions together with free file sharing services.\n\nOther software applications help to support encrypted sessions\n\nand communications. Well known applications supporting end­to­\n\nend encryption are used by hundreds of millions of folks,\n\nsometimes unknowingly, every day. IM clients like Microsoft’s\n\nSkype implement 256­bit AES encrypted communications, while\n\nPutty, Winscp and Windows Remote Desktop help provide private\n\ncommunications and sessions with fully encrypted\n\ncommunications as well. Most of these communications across\n\nthe wire are currently unbreakable when intercepted, at\n\nleast, when the applications are configured properly.\n\n# Summer 2016 Watering Hole Resources and Trickery – WinRAR and TrueCrypt\n\nThis actor set up a particularly clever site to deliver trojanized\n\nWinRAR installers in the summer of 2016, appears to have\n\ncompromised another, and this activity reminds us somewhat of\n\n[the early 2014 Crouching Yeti activity. Much of the Crouching Yeti](https://securelist.com/blog/research/65240/energetic-bear-more-like-a-crouching-yeti/)\n\nintrusions were enabled by trojanizing legitimate ICS­related IT\n\nsoftware installers like SCADA environment vpn client installers\n\nand industrial camera software driver installers. Then, they would\n\ncompromise the legitimate company software distribution sites\n\nand replace the legitimate installers with the Crouching Yeti\n\ntrojanized versions. The tactics effectively compromised ICS and\n\nSCADA related facilities and networks around the world. Simply\n\nput, even when visiting a legitimate company distribution site, IT\n\nstaff was downloading and installing ICS­focused malware.\n\nStrongPity’s efforts did much the same.\n\nIn the case of StrongPity, the attackers were not focused on ICS\n\nor SCADA. They set up a domain name\n\n\n-----\n\ndistributor” site in Europe to redirect to their poisoned installers\n\nhosted on ralrab[.]com. In Belgium, the attackers placed a\n\n“recommended” link to their ralrab[.]com site in the middle of the\n\nlocalized WinRAR distribution page on winrar[.]be. The big blue\n\nrecommended button (here in French) linked to the malicious\n\ninstaller, while all the other links on the page directed to legitimate\n\nsoftware:\n\n**_Winrar[.]be site with “recommended link” leading to_**\n\n**_malicious ralrab[.]com_**\n\nThe winrar[.]be site evaluated what “recommended” package a\n\nvisitor may need based on browser localization and processor\n\ncapability, and accordingly offered up appropriate trojanized\n\nversions. Installer resources named for french and dutch\n\nversions, along with 32­bit versus 64­bit compiled executables\n\nwere provided over the summer:\n\nhxxp://www.ralrab[.]com/rar/winrar­x64­531.exe\n\nhxxp://www.ralrab[.]com/rar/winrar­x64­531fr.exe\n\nhxxp://www.ralrab[.]com/rar/winrar­x64­531nl.exe\n\nhxxp://www.ralrab[.]com/rar/wrar531.exe\n\nhxxp://www.ralrab[.]com/rar/wrar531fr.exe\n\nhxxp://www.ralrab[.]com/rar/wrar531nl.exe\n\nhxxp://ralrab[.]com/rar/winrar­x64­531.exe\n\nhxxp://ralrab[.]com/rar/winrar­x64­531nl.exe\n\nhxxp://ralrab[.]com/rar/wrar531fr.exe\n\nhxxp://ralrab[.]com/rar/wrar531nl.exe\n\nhxxp://ralrab[.]com/rar/wrar53b5.exe\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Directory listing, poisoned StrongPity installers, at_**\n\n**_rarlrab[.]com_**\n\nThe first available visitor redirects from winrar[.]be to ralrab[.]com\n\nfirst appeared on May 28th, 2016, from the dutch speaking\n\nversion of the winrar.be site. And around the same time, another\n\n“certified distributor” winrar[.]it served trojanized installers as well.\n\nThe major difference here is that we didn’t record redirections to\n\nralrab[.]com, but it appears the site directly served StrongPity\n\ntrojanized installers:\n\nhxxps://www.winrar[.]it/prelievo/WinRAR­x64­531it.exe\n\nhxxps://www.winrar[.]it/prelievo/WRar531it.exe\n\nThe site started serving these executables a couple of days\n\nearlier on 5/24, where a large majority of Italian visitors where\n\naffected.\n\n\n-----\n\nQuite simply, the download links on this site directed visitors to\n\ntrojanized WinRAR installers hosted from the winrar.it site itself.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that both of the sites are “distributors”,\n\nwhere the sites are owned and managed not by rarlabs, but by\n\nlocal owners in individual countries.\n\nStrongPity also directed specific visitors from popular, localized\n\nsoftware sharing sites directly to their trojanized installers. This\n\nactivity continued into late September 2016. In particular, the\n\ngroup redirected visitors from software aggregation and sharing\n\nsite tamindir[.]com to their attacker­controlled site at true­\n\ncrypt[.]com. The StrongPity controlled Truecrypt site is a complete\n\nrip of the legitimate site, now hosted by Sourceforge. Here is the\n\nTamindir truecrypt page, looks harmless enough.\n\n**_TrueCrypt page, tamindir software sharing site_**\n\nUnlike the newer poisoned WinRAR installers, StrongPity hosted\n\nseveral Much like the poisoned WinRAR installers, multiple\n\nfilenames have been used to keep up with visitor interests.\n\nVisitors may have been directed to the site by other means and\n\ndownloaded directly from the ripped and persuasive site.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_true­crypt[.]com malicious StrongPity distribution site_**\n\nAt the very bottom of the page, there are a couple of links to the\n\npoisoned installers:\n\nhxxp://www.true­crypt[.]com/download/TrueCrypt­Setup­\n\n7.1a.exe\n\nhxxp://true­crypt[.]com/files/TrueCrypt­7.2.exe\n\nReferrers include these localized software aggregates and\n\nsharers:\n\ngezginler[.]net/indir/truecrypt.html\n\ntamindir[.]com/truecrypt/indir\n\nIt’s interesting that Ksn recorded appearance of the the file on two\n\nunique systems in December 2015, a third in January 2016, all in\n\nTurkey, and then nothing until May 2016. Then, deployment of the\n\ninstallers continued mostly within Turkey in July and September\n\n2016.\n\n# Summer 2016 Watering Hole Victim\n\n\n-----\n\n# Geolocations – WinRAR and TrueCrypt\n\nOver the course of a little over a week, malware delivered from\n\nwinrar.it appeared on over 600 systems throughout Europe and\n\nNorthern Africa/Middle East. Likely, many more infections actually\n\noccurred. Accordingly, the country with the overwhelming number\n\nof detections was in Italy followed by Belgium and Algeria. The\n\ntop countries with StrongPity malware from the winrar.it site from\n\nMay 25th through the first few days of June are\n\nItaly, Belgium, Algeria, Cote D’Ivoire, Morroco, France,\n\nand Tunisia.\n\n**_winrar[.]it StrongPity component geolocation distribution_**\n\nIn a similar time­span, the over sixty visitors redirected from\n\nwinrar.be to ralrab.com for malicious file download were\n\noverwhelmingly located in one country. The top countries directed\n\nto StrongPity malware from the winrar.be site from May 25th\n\nthrough the first few days of June are Belgium, Algeria, Morroco,\n\nNetherlands, Canada, Cote D’Ivoire, and Tunisia.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_winrar[.]be StrongPity component geolocation distribution_**\n\nStrongPity previously set up TrueCrypt themed watering holes in\n\nlate 2015. But their offensive activity surged in late summer 2016.\n\nThe group set up a site directly pulled from the contents of the\n\nlegitimate TrueCrypt website. From mid July to early September,\n\ndozens of visitors were redirected from tamindir[.]com to true­\n\ncrypt[.]com with unsurprisingly almost all of the focus on systems\n\nin Turkey, with victims in the Netherlands as well.\n\n**_tamindir[.]com to true­crypt[.]com poisoned TrueCrypt_**\n\n**_installer redirects_**\n\n# StrongPity Malware\n\nThe StrongPity droppers were often signed with unusual digital\n\ncertificates, dropping multiple components that not only provide\n\ncomplete control of the victim system, but effectively steal disk\n\ncontents, and can download components for further collection of\n\nvarious communications and contacts. Because we are talking\n\nabout StrongPity watering holes, let’s take a quick look at what is\n\n\n-----\n\nthe StrongPity components or a dropper, we see a more\n\nexpansive picture. This data includes over 1,000 systems infected\n\nwith a StrongPity component. The top five countries include Italy,\n\nTurkey, Belgium, Algeria, and France.\n\nIn the case of the winrar[.]be/ralrab[.]com watering hole malware,\n\neach one of the six droppers that we observed created a similar\n\nset of dropped components on disk. And, in these cases, the\n\nattackers did not re­use their fake digital certificates. In addition to\n\ninstalling the legitimate version of WinRAR, the dropper installed\n\nthe following StrongPity components:\n\n%temp%\\procexp.exe\n\n%temp%\\sega\\\n\nnvvscv.exe\n\nprst.cab\n\nprst.dll\n\nwndplyr.exe\n\nwrlck.cab\n\nwrlck.dll\n\nOf these files, two are configurable and encrypted with the same\n\nkeyless cipher, “wrlck.cab” and “prst.cab”. While one maintains\n\nseveral callback c2 for the backdoor to fetch more instructions\n\nand upload installed software and file paths, the other maintains\n\nsomething a bit more unusual. “prst.cab” maintains an encrypted\n\nlist of programs that maintain encrypted connections. This simple\n\nencoding takes the most significant nibble for each character,\n\nswaps the nibbles of that byte, and xors the result against the\n\noriginal value. Its code looks something like this:\n\n\n-----\n\ny = x ^ j;\n\nUsing that cipher in the ralrab[.]com malware, the package is\n\nconfigured to seek out several crypto­enabled software\n\napplications, highlighting the group’s interest in users of more\n\nencryption­supported software suites.\n\nputty.exe (a windows SSH client)\n\nfilezilla.exe (supports ftps uploads)\n\nwinscp.exe (a windows secure copy application, providing\n\nencrypted and secure file transfer)\n\nmstsc.exe (Windows Remote Desktop client, providing an\n\nencrypted connection to remote systems)\n\nmRemoteNG.exe (a remote connections manager supporting\n\nSSH, RDP, and other encrypted protocols)\n\nAlso included in StrongPity components are keyloggers and\n\nadditional data stealers.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWidely available, strong cryptography software tools help provide\n\nsecure and private communications that are now easily obtained\n\nand usable. In the summer of 2016, multiple encryption­enabled\n\nsoftware applications were targeted with watering hole, social\n\nengineering tactics, and spyware by the StrongPity APT. While\n\nwatering holes and poisoned installers are tactics that have been\n\neffectively used by other APT, we have never seen the same\n\nfocus on cryptographic­enabled software. When visiting sites and\n\ndownloading encryption­enabled software, it has become\n\nnecessary to verify the validity of the distribution site and the\n\nintegrity of the downloaded file itself. Download sites not using\n\nPGP or strong digital code signing certificates need to re­examine\n\nthe necessity of doing so for their own customers. We have seen\n\nother APT such as Crouching Yeti and Darkhotel distribute\n\npoisoned installers and poisoned executable code, then\n\nredistribute them through similar tactics and over p2p networks.\n\nHopefully, simpler verification systems than the current batch of\n\nPGP and SSL applications will arise to be adopted in larger\n\nnumbers. Until then, strong anti­malware and dynamic whitelisting\n\nsolutions will be more necessary than ever.\n\n_More information about the StrongPity APT group is available to_\n\n_[customers of Kaspersky Intelligent Services.
