In response to this activity this Joint CSA provides mitigations—both general and tailored for each technique--to\nhelp network defenders protect against this activity. The specific vulnerabilities this CSA addresses are:\n\n  - [CVE-2018-13379 Fortinet FortiGate VPN](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379)\n\n  - [CVE-2019-9670 Synacor Zimbra Collaboration Suite](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9670)\n\n  - [CVE-2019-11510 Pulse Secure Pulse Connect Secure VPN](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11510)\n\n  - [CVE-2019-19781 Citrix Application Delivery Controller and Gateway](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19781)\n\n  - [CVE-2020-4006 VMware Workspace ONE Access](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4006)\n\n### Joint FBI-DHS-CISA CSA: SVR Cyber Operations: Trends and Best Practices for Network Defenders\n\n[The Joint FBI-DHS-CISA Cybersecurity Advisory, SVR Cyber Operations: Trends and Best Practices for Network Defenders,](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-116a)\npublished April 26, 2021, provides additional information on the SVR’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPS).\nSpecifically, this CSA points out the FBI's observation that, starting in 2018, the SVR shifted from \"using malware on\nvictim networks to targeting cloud resources, particularly e-mail, to obtain information.\" Significantly, SVR's compromise of\nMicrosoft cloud environments following their SolarWinds Orion supply chain compromise is an example of this trend. This\nCSA points out that because SVR actors used compromised accounts or system misconfigurations they were able \"to\nblend in with normal or unmonitored traffic in an environment not well defended, monitored, or understood by victim\norganizations.\" This CSA identifies and provides recommendations to defend against the following SVR-leveraged TTPs:\n\n  - Password spraying,\n\n  - [Exploitation of CVE-2019-19781 Citrix Application Delivery Controller and Gateway,](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19781)\n\n  - WELLMESS malware, and\n\n  - Additional exploitation activity following initial compromise of trusted SolarWinds Orion software.\n\nThis CSA urges organizations and service providers to \"strengthen their user validation and verification systems to prohibit\nmisuse of their services.\"\n\n### Joint NCSC-CISA-FBI-NSA CSA: Further TTPs associated with SVR cyber actors\n\n[The Joint NCSC(UK)-CISA-FBI-NSA CSA, Further TTPs associated with SVR cyber actors, published May 7, 2021, details](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/joint-advisory-further-ttps-associated-with-svr-cyber-actors)\nadditional SVR TTPs—including some that SVR cyber actors appear to have newly leveraged in response to the CSAs listed\nabove. This CSA points out that because the SVR rapidly moves to exploit newly disclosed vulnerabilities, \"network\ndefenders should ensure that systems are patched promptly following CVE announcements for products they manage.\"\nThis CSA provides details on SVR-leveraged malware, including WELLMESS, WELLMAIL, GoldFinder, GoldMax, and\npossibly Sibot, as well as open-source Red Team command and control frameworks, Sliver and Cobalt Strike.\n\n\n-----",
