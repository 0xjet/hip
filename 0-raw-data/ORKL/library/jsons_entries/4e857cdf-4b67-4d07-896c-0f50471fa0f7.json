The campaign appears to be a\ncontinuation of Lazarus activity dubbed Operation Dream Job, which was first observed in\nAugust 2020. Symantec tracks this sub-set of Lazarus activity under the name Pompilus.\n\n## Operation Dream Job\n\nOperation Dream Job involves Lazarus using fake job offers as a means of luring victims into\nclicking on malicious links or opening malicious attachments that eventually lead to the\ninstallation of malware used for espionage.\n\nPast Dream Job campaigns have targeted individuals in the defense, government, and\n[engineering sectors in activity observed in August 2020 and](https://www.clearskysec.com/operation-dream-job/) [July 2021.](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/lazarus-campaign-ttps-and-evolution?utm_campaign=SED_2020_SES_Daily%20Threat%20Landscape%20Bulletin&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=139259470&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--J6q9LdfcxqEx5uWvbCzht0JfOc4OV82fEOolrbvnpLzo148HySiMyVKrAnXVeP8GIKLQKzgYM65wxMYUmNVksrBTEwg&utm_content=139259470&utm_source=hs_email)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Recently targeted sectors\n\nIn January 2022, Symantec detected attack activity on the networks of a number of\norganizations based in South Korea. The organizations were mainly in the chemical sector,\nwith some being in the information technology (IT) sector. However, it is likely the IT targets\nwere used as a means to gain access to chemical sector organizations.\n\nThere is sufficient evidence to suggest that this recent activity is a continuation of Operation\nDream Job. That evidence includes file hashes, file names, and tools that were observed in\nprevious Dream Job campaigns.\n\nA typical attack begins when a malicious HTM file is received, likely as a malicious link in an\nemail or downloaded from the web. The HTM file is copied to a DLL file called scskapplink.dll\nand injected into the legitimate system management software INISAFE Web EX Client.\n\nThe scskapplink.dll file is typically a signed Trojanized tool with malicious exports added. The\nattackers have been observed using the following signatures: DOCTER USA, INC and \"A\"\nMEDICAL OFFICE, PLLC\n\nNext, scskapplink.dll downloads and executes an additional payload from a command-andcontrol (C&C) server with the URL parameter key/values \"prd_fld=racket\".\n\nThis step kicks off a chain of shellcode loaders that download and execute arbitrary\ncommands from the attackers, as well as additional malware, which are usually executed\nfrom malicious exports added to Trojanized tools such as the Tukaani project LZMA Utils\nlibrary (XZ Utils).\n\nThe attackers move laterally on the network using Windows Management Instrumentation\n(WMI) and inject into MagicLine by DreamSecurity on other machines.\n\nIn some instances, the attackers were spotted dumping credentials from the registry,\ninstalling a BAT file in a likely effort to gain persistence, and using a scheduled task\nconfigured to run as a specific user.\n\nThe attackers were also observed deploying post-compromise tools, including a tool used to\ntake screenshots of web pages viewed on the compromised machine at set intervals\n(SiteShoter). They were also seen using an IP logging tool (IP Logger), a protocol used to\nturn computers on remotely (WakeOnLAN), a file and directory copier (FastCopy), and the\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP) executed under the MagicLine process.\n\n## Case study\n\nThe following is a case study detailing step-by-step attacker activity on an organization in the\nchemical sector.\n\n\n-----\n\n**January 17, 2022**\n\n**00:51 – A malicious HTM file is received:**\n\ne31af5131a095fbc884c56068e19b0c98636d95f93c257a0c829ec3f3cc8e4ba csidl_profile\\appdata\\local\\microsoft\\windows\\inetcache\\ie\\3tygrjkm\\join_06[1].htm\n\nThe HTM file is copied to a DLL file:\n\nrundll32.exe CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\scskapplink.dll,netsetcookie Cnusrmgr\n\nThis DLL file is injected into the legitimate system management software INISAFE Web EX\nClient. The file is a signed Trojanized version of the ComparePlus plugin for Notepad++ with\nmalicious exports added.\n\n**01:02 – The file is run and downloads and executes a backdoor payload (final.cpl -**\n5f20cc6a6a82b940670a0f89eda5d68f091073091394c362bfcaf52145b058db) from a\ncommand-and-control (C&C) server with the URL parameter key/values \"prd_fld=racket\".\n\nThe file final.cpl is a Trojanized version of the Tukaani project LZMA Utils library (XZ Utils)\nwith a malicious export added (AppMgmt).\n\nThe malware connects to, downloads, decodes, and executes shellcode from the following\nremote location:\n\nhxxp[:]//happy[.]nanoace.co.kr/Content/rating/themes/krajeefas/FrmAMEISMngWeb.asp\n\n**01:04 – Another CPL file**\n(61e305d6325b1ffb6de329f1eb5b3a6bcafa26c856861a8200d717df0dec48c4) is executed.\nThis file, again, is a Trojanized version of LZMA Utils with a malicious added export.\n\n**01:13 – The shellcode loader (final.cpl) is executed again several times.**\n\n**01:38 – Commands are executed to dump credentials from the SAM and SYSTEM registry**\nhives.\n\nOver the next several hours, the attackers run unknown shellcode via final.cpl at various\nintervals, likely to collect the dumped system hives, among other things.\n\n**06:41 – The attackers create a scheduled task to ensure persistence between system**\nreboots:\n\nschtasks /create /RU [REDACTED].help\\175287 /ST 15:42 /TR \"cmd.exe /c\nC:\\ProgramData\\Intel\\Intel.bat\" /tn arm /sc MINUTE\n\n\n-----\n\nThe scheduled task instructs the system to execute Intel.bat as user\n‘[REDACTED].help/175287’ starting at 15:42 then every minute under the scheduled task\nname ‘arm’. It's unclear if this was an account that was cracked via the dumped registry\nhives or an account the attackers were able to create with admin rights.\n\nThe attackers were also observed installing Cryptodome (PyCrypto fork) Python encryption\nmodules via CPL files.\n\nA clean installation of BitDefender was also installed by the attackers. While unconfirmed,\nthe threat actors may have installed an older version of this software (from 2020) with a\n[vulnerability that allowed attackers to run arbitrary commands remotely.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bitdefender-fixes-bug-allowing-attackers-to-run-commands-remotely/)\n\n**January 18**\n\n**00:21 – The final.cpl file is executed again.**\n\n**00:49 – A new CPL file called wpm.cpl**\n(942489ce7dce87f7888322a0e56b5e3c3b0130e11f57b3879fbefc48351a78f6) is executed.\n\nCSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\finaldata\\wpm.cpl Thumbs.ini 4 30\n\nThis file contains, and connects to, a list of IP addresses and records whether the\nconnections were successful.\n\n**01:11 – Again, the final.cpl shellcode loader is executed multiple times, executing some**\nunknown shellcode. This activity continued intermittently until 23:49.\n\n**23:49 – The file name of the CPL file changes to 'ntuser.dat'. The file location and command-**\nline arguments remain the same.\n\n**January 19**\n\n**00:24 – The CPL shellcode loader files (final.cpl and ntuser.dat) are executed multiple times.**\n\n**00:28 – The attackers create a scheduled task on another machine, likely to ensure**\npersistence:\n\nschtasks /create /RU [REDACTED]\\i21076 /ST 09:28 /TR \"cmd.exe /c\nC:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\arm.bat\" /tn arm /sc MINUTE\n\nThe command is used to schedule a task named 'arm' to run the file 'arm.bat' starting at at\n09:28 then every minute after that under the user account '[REDACTED]\\i21076'.\n\n**00:29 – A file named arm.dat**\n(48f3ead8477f3ef16da6b74dadc89661a231c82b96f3574c6b7ceb9c03468291) is executed\nwith the following command line arguments:\n\n\n-----\n\nCSIDL_SYSTEM\\rundll32.exe\nCSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\adobe\\arm.dat,packageautoupdater\nLimitedSpatialExtent_U_f48182 -d 1440 -i 10 -q 8 -s 5\n\nThe arm.dat file is a tool used to take screenshots of web pages viewed on the compromised\nmachine every 10 seconds (SiteShoter), as determined by the command line arguments.\nThe screenshots are saved in appdata\\local with the date at the top of the file.\n\n**06:50 – The shellcode loader (final.cpl) is executed several times.**\n\n**07:34 – A new CPL file named addins.cpl**\n(5f20cc6a6a82b940670a0f89eda5d68f091073091394c362bfcaf52145b058db) is executed\nmultiple times, which again is another shellcode loader and has the same command line\narguments as seen with final.cpl:\n\nCSIDL_SYSTEM\\rundll32.exe CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\addins.cpl, AppMgmt\nEO6-CRY-LS2-TRK3\n\n**07:39 – A scheduled task is created:**\n\nsc create uso start= auto binPath= “cmd.exe /c start /b C:\\Programdata\\addins.bat”\nDisplayName= uso\n\nThe task is used to auto-start and execute addins.bat each time the system is booted. The\ntask uses the service name 'uso' (a file name previously used in older Dream Job campaigns\ntargeting security researchers).\n\nThe attacker runs addins.cpl again to run a command to start the service and then delete the\nservice directly after:\n\nCSIDL_SYSTEM\\rundll32.exe CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\addins.cpl, AppMgmt\nEO6-CRY-LS2-TRK3\nsc start uso (via cmd.exe)\nsc delete uso\n\nThe following commands were then executed to collect information pertaining to network\nconfiguration, current user the attackers are logged in as, active users on the machine,\navailable shared drives, and the contents of the 'addins' directory.\n\nipconfig /all\nwhoami\nquery user\nnet use\ndir CSIDL_WINDOWS\\addins\n\n\n-----\n\n**07:41 – The file addins.cpl is executed again multiple times before a scheduled task is**\ncreated to run addins.bat again, start the service, and immediately delete the service:\n\nsc create uso start= auto binPath= \"cmd.exe /c start /b C:\\Windows\\addins\\addins.bat\"\nDisplayName= uso\nsc start uso\nsc delete uso\n\n**January 20**\n\nThe attackers execute addins.cpl again with the same command line as before.\n\nNo further activity is observed.\n\nThe Lazarus group is likely targeting organizations in the chemical sector to obtain\nintellectual property to further North Korea’s own pursuits in this area. The group’s\n[continuation of Operation Dream Job, as witnessed by Symantec and others, suggests that](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/countering-threats-north-korea/)\nthe operation is sufficiently successful. As such, organizations should ensure they have\nadequate security in place and remain vigilant for attacks such as this.\n\nAs always, users should be wary of clicking links or downloading files even if they come from\nseemingly trustworthy sources.\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\n[For the latest protection updates, please visit the Symantec Protection Bulletin.](https://www.broadcom.com/support/security-center/protection-bulletin)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**SHA-256**\n\n164f6a8f7d2035ea47514ea84294348e32c90d817724b80ad9cd3af6f93d83f8\n\n18686d04f22d3b593dd78078c9db0ac70f66c7138789ad38469ec13162b14cef\n\n1cb8ea3e959dee988272904dbb134dad93539f2c07f08e1d6e10e75a019b9976\n\n2dd29b36664b28803819054a59934f7a358a762068b18c744281e1589af00f1f\n\n32bfdf1744077c9365a811d66a6ea152831a60a4f94e671a83228016fc87615f\n\n35de8163c433e8d9bf6a0097a506e3abbb8308330d3c5d1dea6db71e1d225fc3\n\n4277fcaada4939b76a3df4515b7f74837bf8c4b75d4ff00f8d464169eede01e3\n\n4446efafb4b757f7fc20485198236bed787c67ceffc05f70cd798612424384ce\n\n\n-----\n\n48f3ead8477f3ef16da6b74dadc89661a231c82b96f3574c6b7ceb9c03468291\n\n4a2236596e92fa704d8550c56598855121430f96fe088712b043cba516f1c76c\n\n54029bd4fcc24551564942561a60b906bee136264f24f43775b7a8e15095a9e0\n\n56da872e8b0f145417defd4a37f357b2f73f244836ee30ac27af7591cda2d283\n\n5e7edc8f1c652f53a6d2eabfbd9252781598de91dbe59b7a74706f69eb52b287\n\n5f20cc6a6a82b940670a0f89eda5d68f091073091394c362bfcaf52145b058db\n\n61e305d6325b1ffb6de329f1eb5b3a6bcafa26c856861a8200d717df0dec48c4\n\n67f1db122ad8f01e5faa60e2facf16c0752f6ab24b922f218efce19b0afaf607\n\n7491f298e27eb7ce7ebbf8821527667a88eecd5f3bc5b38cd5611f7ebefde21e\n\n79b7964bde948b70a7c3869d34fe5d5205e6259d77d9ac7451727d68a751aa7d\n\n7aa62af5a55022fd89b3f0c025ea508128a03aab5bc7f92787b30a3e9bc5c6e4\n\n8769912b9769b4c11aabc523a699d029917851822d4bc1cb6cc65b0c27d2b135\n\n8aace6989484b88abc7e3ec6f70b60d4554bf8ee0f1ccad15db84ad04c953c2d\n\n942489ce7dce87f7888322a0e56b5e3c3b0130e11f57b3879fbefc48351a78f6\n\na881c9f40c1a5be3919cafb2ebe2bb5b19e29f0f7b28186ee1f4b554d692e776\n\nbdb76c8d0afcd6b57c8f1fa644765b95375af2c3a844c286db7f60cf9ca1a22a\n\nd815fb8febaf113f3cec82f552dfec1f205071a0492f7e6a2657fa6b069648c6\n\ne1997d1c3d84c29e02b1b7b726a0d0f889a044d7cd339f4fb88194c2c0c6606d\n\ne31af5131a095fbc884c56068e19b0c98636d95f93c257a0c829ec3f3cc8e4ba\n\nef987baef9a1619454b14e1fec64283808d4e0ce16fb87d06049bfcf9cf56af3\n\nf29d386bdf77142cf2436797fba1f8b05fab5597218c2b77f57e46b8400eb9de\n\nf7359490d6c141ef7a9ee2c03dbbd6ce3069e926d83439e1f8a3dfb3a7c3dc94\n\nf8995634b102179a5d3356c6f353cb3a42283d9822e157502486262a3af4447e\n\nff167e09b3b7ad6ed1dead9ee5b4747dd308699a00905e86162d1ec1b61e0476\n\n**Network**\n\n\n-----\n\n52.79.118.195\n\n61.81.50.174\n\n[URL]/[FOLDER]/[FILENAME]asp?prd_fld=racket\n\nhappy.nanoace[.]co.kr\n\nhxxp://happy.nanoace[.]co.kr/Content/rating/themes/krajee-fas/FrmAMEISMngWeb.asp\n\nhxxps://mariamchurch[.]com/board/news/index.asp\n\nhxxps://www.aumentarelevisite[.]com/img/context/offline.php\n\nmariamchurch.com\n\nwww.aumentarelevisite[.]com\n\nwww.juneprint[.]com\n\nwww.jungfrau[.]co.kr\n\nwww.ric-camid[.]re.kr\n\n**File names**\n\naddins.cpl\n\ndolby.cpl\n\nezhelp.cpl\n\nfinal.cpl\n\nofficecert.ocx\n\nwpm.cpl\n\n**Services**\n\narm\n\nuso\n\n\n-----\n\n## About the Author\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n**Symantec**\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to\ninvestigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer\nanalysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n\n-----",
