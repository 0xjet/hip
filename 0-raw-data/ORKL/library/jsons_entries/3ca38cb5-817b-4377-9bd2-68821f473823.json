MSTIC has been tracking NICKEL since 2016 and observed some common\nactivity with other actors known in the security community as APT15, APT25, and KeChang. Today, the Microsoft\n[Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) announced the successful seizure of a set of NICKEL-operated websites and disruption of](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/12/06/cyberattacks-nickel-dcu-china/)\ntheir ongoing attacks targeting organizations in 29 countries, following a court order from the U.S. District Court for the\nEastern District of Virginia granting Microsoft the authority to seize these sites.\n\nMSTIC has tracked the current NICKEL operations, including attacks against government organizations, diplomatic\nentities, and NGOs, since September 2019. During this time, NICKEL activity has been observed across several\ncountries, with a large amount of activity targeting Central and South American governments. Notably, NICKEL has\nachieved long-term access to several targets, allowing NICKEL to conduct activities such as regularly scheduled\nexfiltration of data. As China’s influence around the world continues to grow and the nation establishes bilateral\nrelations with more countries and extends partnerships in support of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, we assess that\nChina-based threat actors will continue to target customers in government, diplomatic, and NGO sectors to gain new\ninsights, likely in pursuit of economic espionage or traditional intelligence collection objectives. Portions of the NICKEL\n[activity we are highlighting have also been blogged about by our colleagues at ESET.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ESET_Okrum_and_Ketrican.pdf)\n\n_Figure 1: NICKEL targeted countries: Argentina, Barbados, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia,_\n_Croatia, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, France, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Italy,_\n_Jamaica, Mali, Mexico, Montenegro, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Switzerland, Trinidad and Tobago, United Kingdom,_\n_United States of America, Venezuela_\n\n\n-----\n\nAs with any observed nation state actor activity, Microsoft continues to notify customers that have been targeted or\ncompromised, providing them with the information they need to help secure their organizations. To reduce the potential\nimpact of this NICKEL activity, Microsoft encourages our customers to immediately review the activity and guidance\nbelow, then implement risk mitigations, harden environments, and investigate suspicious behaviors that match the\ntactics described in this blog. MSTIC will continue to observe, monitor, and notify affected customers and partners,\nwhen possible, through our nation-state notification process.\n\n## Observed activity\n\nMSTIC has observed NICKEL actors using exploits against unpatched systems to compromise remote access\nservices and appliances. Upon successful intrusion, they have used credential dumpers or stealers to obtain legitimate\ncredentials, which they used to gain access to victim accounts. NICKEL actors created and deployed custom malware\nthat allowed them to maintain persistence on victim networks over extended periods of time. MSTIC has also observed\nNICKEL perform frequent and scheduled data collection and exfiltration from victim networks.\n\nNICKEL successfully compromises networks using attacks on internet-facing web applications running on unpatched\nMicrosoft Exchange and SharePoint. They also attack remote access infrastructure, such as unpatched VPN\n[appliances, as referenced in the FireEye April 2021 blog detailing a 0-day vulnerability in Pulse Secure VPN that has](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/suspected-apt-actors-leverage-bypass-techniques-pulse-secure-zero-day)\nsince been patched.\n\nAfter gaining an initial foothold on a compromised system, the NICKEL actors routinely performed reconnaissance on\nthe network, working to gain access to additional accounts or higher-value systems. NICKEL typically deployed a\nkeylogger to capture credentials from users on compromised systems. We’ve observed NICKEL using Mimikatz,\nWDigest (an older authentication method that allows the attacker access to credentials in clear text), NTDSDump, and\nother password dumping tools to gather credentials on a targeted system and from target browsers.\n\nDeploying malware for command and control\n\nMSTIC tracks multiple malware families used by NICKEL for command and control as Neoichor, Leeson, NumbIdea,\nNullItch, and Rokum.\n\nThe Leeson, Neoichor, and NumbIdea malware families typically use the Internet Explorer (IE) COM interface to\nconnect and receive commands from hardcoded C2 servers. Due to their reliance on IE, these malware families\nintentionally configure the browser settings by modifying the following registry entries:\n```\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Main]\nStart Page = “about:blank”\nDisableFirstRunCustomize = 1\nRunOnceComplete = 1\nRunOnceHasShown = 1\nCheck_Associations = 1\n\n```\n```\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Recovery]\n\n```\n```\nAutoRecover = 0\n\n```\n```\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Privacy]\n\n```\n```\nClearBrowsingHistoryOnExit = 1\n\n```\n```\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Connection Wizard]\n\n```\n```\nCompleted = 1\n\n```\n```\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\ZoneMap]\n\n```\n```\nIEHarden = 0\n\n```\n\nWhen connecting to the C2 servers, the URL requests follow these formats:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nhttp[:]// C2 ?id 5 digit rand system specific string\nhttp[:]//<C2>?setssion==<rand><GetTickCount>\nhttp[:]//<C2>?newfrs%dsetssion=<rand><GetTickCount>\nhttp[:]//<C2>/index.htm?content=<base64-system-specifc-string>&id=<num>\n\n```\nA typical response from the C2 server is a legitimate-looking webpage containing the string “!DOCTYPE html”, which\nthe malware checks. The malware then locates a Base64-encoded blob, which it decodes and proceeds to load as a\nshellcode.\n\nFor the Neoichor family, the malware checks for internet connectivity by contacting bing.com with the request format\nbing.com?id=<GetTickCount> and drops files as ~atemp and ~btemp containing error codes and debug resources.\n\nThe NICKEL implants are backdoors capable of collecting system information, such as:\n\nIP address\nOS version\nSystem language ID\nComputer name\nSigned-in username\n\nThey implement basic backdoor functionalities, including:\n\nLaunching a process\nUploading a file\nDownloading a file\nExecuting a shellcode in memory\n\nMSTIC has observed NICKEL drop their malware into existing installed software paths. They did this to make their\nmalware appear to be files used for an installed application. The following are example paths:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Realtek\\Audio\\HDA\\AERTSr.exe\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Foxit Software\\Foxit Reader\\FoxitRdr64.exe\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Adobe\\Flash Player\\AddIns\\airappinstaller\\airappinstall.exe\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Adobe\\Acrobat Reader DC\\Reader\\AcroRd64.exe\n\n## Using compromised credentials for routine email collection\n\nNICKEL used compromised credentials to sign into victims’ Microsoft 365 accounts through normal sign-ins with a\nbrowser and the legacy Exchange Web Services (EWS) protocol to review and collect victim emails. MSTIC has\nobserved successful NICKEL sign-ins to compromised accounts through commercial VPN providers as well as from\nactor-controlled infrastructure. The activity graphed below shows NICKEL sign-in activity happening most frequently\non Monday through Friday from 12:00 AM UTC (8:00 AM China Standard time) through 09:00 AM UTC (5:00 PM\nChina Standard Time). There are also possible indications of a shift-based scheduling model based on the observed\nlimited set of activity during a typical weekend.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Heatmap of observed NICKEL login activity by day of week and hour (UTC time)_\n\n## Evidence of routine host data collection\n\nIn several observed cases, NICKEL was seen performing regular data collection for exfiltration purposes. Their activity\nincluded looking in directories of interest for new files added since the last time they collected data. In the example\nbelow, NICKEL was collecting data that had been created or modified multiple times over a one-month period. For\ninstance, on October 22, NICKEL looked for files that had been created since October 19 in multiple folders.\nPreviously, on October 20 they had done the same thing looking for files that were modified or created since October\n13.\n\nHere are recent examples of NICKEL’s routine data collection:\n\nAfter collecting the data in a central directory, the attackers then used either a renamed rar.exe or 7z.exe to archive\nthe files. NICKEL also frequently used keyboard walks as a password for their archived data collections. The following\nare examples of RAR archiving for exfiltration:\n\nHere is an example of 7zip archiving for exfiltration:\n\nMicrosoft will continue to monitor NICKEL activity and implement product protections for our customers. The IOCs,\ncurrent detections, and advanced protections in place across our security products are detailed below.\n\n## Recommended defenses\n\nThe following guidance can help mitigate the techniques
