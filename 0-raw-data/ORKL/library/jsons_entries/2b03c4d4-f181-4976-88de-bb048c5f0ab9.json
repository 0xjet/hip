Security of cyberspace is extremely important to ensure peace and prosperity of the\n\ninternational community including Japan, and it was reaffirmed at the recent G7\nLeaders’ Summit held in the United Kingdom.\n\n2. Against this backdrop, on July 19th (local time), the United Kingdom, the United States\n\nand other countries issued public statements including on a group conducting\ncyberattacks known as APT40 which the Chinese government is behind, and an\nindictment charging four members of APT40 has been issued in the United States.\nJapan also assesses that it is highly likely that the Chinese government is behind\nAPT40 and has been paying close attention with deep concern to these attacks by\nAPT40 and others which threaten the security of cyberspace. Japan strongly supports\nthe public statements by the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries\nwhich express the determination to uphold the rules-based international order in\ncyberspace.\n\n3. Japan recently made the announcement on cyberattacks in which it is highly likely that\n\nan Advanced Persistent Threat group called Tick, which the Unit 61419 of the Chinese\nPeople’s Liberation Army is behind, was involved. Japan further confirmed that\nJapanese companies were also targeted in the aforementioned case by the group\nknown as APT40.\n\n4. Malicious cyber activities that could potentially undermine the foundation of democracy\n\nembodied by free, fair and secure cyberspace cannot be condoned. The Government\nof Japan considers it to be a matter of strong concern from the national security\nviewpoint, firmly condemns and will take strict measures against these activities.\n\n\n-----\n\n5. Japan will continue to closely cooperate with the international community including the\n\nG7 countries and make efforts in order to develop free, fair and secure cyberspace.\n\n## Related Links\n\n[Cybersecurity](https://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/page18e_000015.html)\n\n\n-----",
