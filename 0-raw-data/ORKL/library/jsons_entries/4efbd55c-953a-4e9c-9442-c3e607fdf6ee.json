    "plain_text": "# The A1 Telekom Austria Hack\n\n**blog.haschek.at/2020/the-a1-telekom-hack.html**\n\nChristian\n\nOn the 3rd of February 2020 I received an encrypted email on 3 of my email addresses\nfrom a person calling themself `\"Libertas\" with the subject \"Information for the public\".`\n\nI am writing to you today because you seem to be a IT security related guy from\nAustria with a brain. I hope this assumption is correct, otherwise please disregard this\nmessage.\n\nI am writing concerning your local telecom company A1 Telekom. -Libertas\n\nAt first I thought it's some conspiracy theorist who wants to publish something on my blog\n```\n (they always do) but it was not one of these cases and I wasn't prepared to what they\n\n```\npresented me.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\nAfter confirming the hack with A1 I was asked to postpone the publishing of this post until\nA1 has kicked the attackers out. I complied with their request so I wouldn't interfere with the\nongoing investigation. Since I did not publish this post for months the whistleblower also\ncontacted a journalist from Heise.de and we agreed to release our articles at the same time.\n\nSince I have no way of checking the validity of individual statements made by the\nwhistleblower, they could all be fabricated. I find them very plausible and many details of the\nemail were confirmed by A1 but keep it in the back of your head that the statements of\n\n\n-----\n\nLibertas might be untrue or half-true until confirmed by A1 Telekom. Since I had the\nopportunity to talk to people from A1 I will add their statements in blue.\n\n## First things first: WTF is A1 Telekom?\n\n[A1 Telekom is one of the largest telecom companies in Austria. They own a large variety of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1_Telekom_Austria)\nIT infrastructure including the FTTH connection I am currenlty using for my home office.\n\nThey have a yearly revenue of about 2.5 Billion €, over 8,300 employees and in more rural\nparts of the country they are the only provider of internet and phone connections. They are\na big deal here.\n\n## Who is Libertas?\n\nLibertas is the `whistleblower who informed me and a journalist from Heise.de about the`\nA1 hack. Libertas `is not the hacker who infiltrated A1 but rather someone close to A1`\nwith confirmed insider knowledge.\n\n## What about the alleged hack?\n\nThe whistleblower stated that around December 2019 the A1 internal CERT (computer\nemergency response team) (lead by a person the source named in the Email) was informed\nabout problems with their internal EMS system.\n\nTheir malware detection systems found several webshells spread around a variety of\nservers but at this point almost all internal servers were compromised. Including two of their\ninternal domains.\n\nA1 confirmed the timeline and attack vector but stated that not \"almost all internal servers\"\nwere compromised but only a dozen.\n\nAccording to the source one of the attacked domains was a managed customer network for\na large austrian company.\n\nA1 found this not to be true as the attacker only had access to their office and a few\ndevices, none of the compromised devices were outside of their office network\n\n## How did they get in?\n\nThe source suspects, that the attackers got in using a vulnerability of an (unspecified)\nMicrosoft product.\n\n\n-----\n\nhere are several reasons why they where able to move around so comfortably. While\nA1 spent lots of resources to protect their systems from external threats, internal\nthreats where not really cared about. Meaning it is pretty easy for an authorized user\nto take control over systems he normally would not have control over. And\nunfortunately, as this example shows, it happens that unauthorized people take over\nthe role of such authorized users. -Libertas\n\nThe source names two internal admin accounts called `\"VIPRegionen\" and`\n```\n\"ITSolution\" and also added the passwords of these accounts to the email they sent\n\n```\nme. The passwords to these accounts started with `\"Y_2\" and` `\"X_7\" and were`\n(according to the source) unchanged since 2013 and were well known to a few generations\nof technicians at the company.\n```\nNote: This fact has nothing to do with the hack, it was just meant for me\nto confirm the validity of the whistleblowers insights into the company.\n\n```\nThey state these logins were used by the \"Core team\" which operate Windows Systems for\nA1 customers and interal ones. There's also the \"NTOS team\" which manage most A1\ninternal Windows Servers and the \"UXOS team\" manages all linux based systems. The\nlatter one allegedly manages over 2500 systems.\n\nThe whistleblower also sent me the (uncensored) ECDSA private key for the root user:\n\nECDSA key\n\nA1 confirmed the existence of webshells and the validity of the passwords, although they\nwere old and most of them not used anymore.\n\n## What about the databases?\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nThe source states that the database systems were also compromised and the password of\nthe Database Administration Team sarted with `\"Gfr\" . A1 also manages some external`\ncorporate customer database systems and the root password for them is the same as the\none above with a single symbol added at the end.\n\nThe source also claimed the DBA team rotates this master password and has changed it 8\ntimes since 2014.\n\n\n-----\n\nA1 confirmed that the attackers had access to a SQL database and did various queries\nalthough they said no customer data was in those databases and no customer info was\ntransferred out of the system.\n\n## How widespread was the breach?\n\nAccording to the whistleblower attackers gained access to more than 12,000 client systems\nwhich were all operated by A1. A1 said this was not true and just about a dozen devices\nwere compromised and these were all in the Office space. The number 12,000 systems was\nconfirmed by A1 to be the whole number of devices they manage, not the number of\ncompromised computers.\n\nMy source tells me that he doubts that this is the first huge successful infiltration of\nA1, but much more likely just the first one detected. A1 brought in `-REDACTED`\n```\n  COMPANY NAME- and -REDACTED COMPANY NAME- in early January to investigate\n\n```\nand launched an internal project ( \"Project Alcatraz\" ) to increase security\nawareness and procedures all around A1. -Libertas\n\nThe source also states that A1 did not only not make it public, they even let the attackers\nroam in their systems and let them download \"massive amounts\" of customer data to find\nout more about them without alarming them.\n\nHowever, it seems that one of their main concerns is keeping all of this under wraps\nand not really acting because that could \"alarm the attackers that we are watching\"\nand even ordering certain security features not yet to be implemented on certain\nsystems where activity of the attackers was noted or suspected. So they implemented\nall kind of additional monitoring (like running Sysmon on many internal Windows\nsystems and centrally analyzing the data) while they let the attackers pull all kind of\ndata from their systems including massive amounts of customer data. -Libertas\n\nThey also state that the attackers were watched making very specific queries of location,\nphone numbers and other customer data for certain private A1 customers. the source did\nnot disclose who these people were.\n\nA1 stated that the attackers did not have access to any client systems, only a few devices in\ntheir corporate office were infected and no customer data was stolen. They confirmed that\nexternal IT security professionals were flown in in January\n\n## When did the attack stop?\n\nA1 told me that the attackers were successfully kicked out of the system on May 22nd 2020\nby closing all remaining backdoors. The aftermath for A1 was a painful one as any\nsysadmin can imagine:\n\n\n-----\n\nNew Passwords for all 8000+ employees\nNew keys and passwords for all servers and services\nIT security training\n\n## Who were the attackers?\n\nThe source thinks it was the [Gallium group who are notorious for using bugs in Windows](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-warns-gallium-telco-hackers-are-targeting-vulnerable-web-servers/)\nweb servers and specifically targetting telecom companies which might have ties to the\nChinese Ministry of State Security according to the source.\n\nThere are quite some hints that a state power or similar is at work here, but honestly\nyou know attribution is hard and these could probably be all kind of three-letter\nagency weasels from god knows where. -Libertas\n\nA1 stated that they had no clues who the attackers were only that they used multiple VPN\nservers from multiple countries.\n\n## Why is the source telling me this?\n\nThe person says \"The public should be informed about this\"\n\nThe public should know and A1 should act here and condemn these constant network\ninfiltrations coming from god alone knows what state agencies. Also they should\npublicate what they improve now in order to also help others to secure them against\nthese threats. -Libertas\n\nThe email ended with\n```\nPlease understand that i cannot keep in touch with you, this will be my only\ncommunication.\nbest regards,\nconcerned third party\n\n```\nWhen I tried to write back I got an error message from their email provider stating the\naccount no longer exists.\n\n## Let's recap\n\nThe anonymous source states that\n\nA1 was owned on a massive scale (over 12000 Servers)\nThe attack was known internally but not stopped (to learn more about the attackers)\nIt is unclear who the attackers were or if they were state sponsored but it seems to be\na very sophisticated attack\n\n\n-----\n\nA1 corrected it\n\nOnly a dozen devices were compromised and no customer or corporate data was\nstolen\nThe attackers were discovered and kicked off their network on May 22 2020\nA1 was not blackmailed and it was not a cryptolocker\n\n\n-----",
