This analysis was\npresented in full at the JSAC 2023 in January 2023.\n\nBy: Hara Hiroaki, Yuka Higashi, Masaoki Shoji\nFebruary 16, 2023\nRead time: ( words)\n\nIn 2021, we observed several targeted attacks against researchers of academic organizations and think tanks in\nJapan. We have since been tracking this series of attacks and identified the new intrusion set we have named “Earth\n[Yako”. Our research points the attribution to the known campaign “Operation](https://security.macnica.co.jp/blog/2022/05/iso.html) [RestyLink”](https://insight-jp.nttsecurity.com/post/102hojk/operation-restylink-apt-campaign-targeting-japanese-companies) [or “Enelink”.](https://www.ipa.go.jp/files/000099786.pdf)\n\nUpon investigating several incidents, we identified previously unknown malware, tactics, techniques and procedures\n(TTPs), and infrastructure used by Earth Yako for cyberespionage. The intrusion set introduced new tools and\nmalware within a short period of time, frequently changing and expanding its attack targets. Since we observed related\nattacks as recent as January 2023, we believe that Earth Yako is still active and will keep targeting more organizations\n[soon. This investigation was presented at the JSAC 2023 in Tokyo, Japan.](https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/timetable.html#:~:text=2023%20JPCERT/CC-,Invitation%20to%20Secret%20Event%3A%20Uncovering%20campaigns%20targeting%20East%20Asia%20by%20Earth%20Yako,-Abstract)\n\nOverview of The Campaign\n\nSince January 2022, we have been observing Earth Yako as it targets researchers in the academe and research think\ntanks in Japan. We also observed a small number of attacks that appear to have targeted organizations in Taiwan.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Timeline of Earth Yako campaign\nWhile consistently targeting researchers, the areas of interest for Earth Yako’s deployment and targeting have varied\nover time. Earlier in 2022, their main targets were stakeholders related to economic security, but later expanded to\ntarget other sectors such as the energy or economic industry.\n\nIn this campaign, Earth Yako uses a spearphishing link for initial access. The URL in the spearphishing mail\ndownloads the compressed (.zip) or disc image (.iso) file containing a malicious shortcut file (.lnk) to download another\npayload. We observed several spearphishing emails masquerading as an invitation for a private or public meeting-like\nevents, which leads to download the malware in the target system.\n\nMalware and Tools\n\nHere is a summary of the new malware and tools we observed from the different incidents:\n\nMirrorKey: An on-memory dynamic link library (DLL) loader\nTransBox: A backdoor abusing the Dropbox API\nPlugBox: A Dropbox API-based backdoor with a couple of capabilities\nDulload: A generic loader name\nPULink: A dropper of ShellBox written in C++/CLR, capable of achieving persistence\nShellBox: Another Dropbox API-based stager written in C#\n\nIncident Case Studies\n\nWe observed Earth Yako using spearphishing for entry, with the URL in the email body leading the target to download\na .zip or .iso file when clicked. The .lnk file contained in the archive induces the target to download a malicious Word\ntemplate. There have been other instances reported when, after opening the URL, the routine infects the target with\nCobalt Strike, sideloading a .dll file. In the following sections, we introduce some of the incidents we observed in 2022\nwhen Earth Yako deployed new malware.\n\n**Incident 1**\n\nThe first case was observed in March 2022, targeting researchers in a Japanese academic institution. After intruding\nin the target system, the attacker deployed MirrorKey and TransBox in the following flow.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Execution flow of MirrorKey and TransBox in Incident 1\n**MirrorKey**\n\nWe found MirrorKey in the infected system under the file name OCLEAN.DLL. This DLL is loaded by OFFCLN.EXE,\nwhich is a legitimate Microsoft application but used for DLL sideloading to load OCLEAN.DLL in the same directory on\nexecution. After loading, MirrorKey looks for DWINTL.DLL in the same directory, a DLL signed by Microsoft and has\nno malicious code in its code section so it appears to be harmless. But the digital signature has been abused to\n[embed an encrypted payload for vulnerability MS13-098 or](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2013/ms13-098) [CVE-2013-3900. CVE-2013-3900 is a vulnerability that](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-3900)\ndoes not properly validate the executable (PE) file digest during Authenticode Signature validation, which can be\nabused by an attacker to embed arbitrary data at the end of a legitimate digital signature.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. DWINTL.DLL’s legitimate digital signature issued by\n\nMicrosoft\n\nFigure 4. Embedded data abusing CVE-2013-3900\nIn this case, two types of data were embedded: an encrypted payload and data for decryption. MirrorKey processes\nthe data embedded at the end of the file to generate a decryption key for the payload. Once successfully generated,\nthe key is used to decrypt the embedded payload with AES128-ECB.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Key generation logic for payload decryption\n**TransBox**\n\nThe decrypted payload was a DLL internally named FILETRANDLL.dll. This DLL is dynamically loaded in the memory\nby MirrorKey and begins its malicious activity when the export function Start_ is called.\n\nFigure 6. Original file name embedded in DLL\nOur analysis revealed that this DLL is a backdoor that uses the Dropbox API and is designed primarily for file and data\ntheft. No similar malware has been identified in the past.\n\n1.   Check-in\n\nOn execution, TransBox generates a unique ID for the infected user (Victim ID) This is calculated as the product of the\nfour elements:\n\nCRC32 of the domain name of the infected terminal\nthe CRC32 of the username\nthe CRC32 of the host name, and\nthe first 4 bytes (DWORD) of the volume serial number\n\nNext, the system information from the infected machine is collected, such as drive-related information, host name,\noperating system (OS) version, and IP address. The system information is then compressed with zlib and encoded\nwith 1-byte XOR cipher, and uploaded to the attacker’s Dropbox account. On uploading, a destination file path in\nDropbox /<Victim ID decimal>/<Victim ID decimal>.jpg was specified on uploading information to the URL\nhxxps://content[.]dropboxapi[.]com/2/files/upload.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. HTTP request on check-in\n2.   Uploading files\n\nTransBox can upload files to Dropbox with specific extensions that exist under a specific directory. Target directories\nand file extensions are as follows:\n\nTarget directories\n\nAll drives (except A drive and CD-ROM)\n%USERPROFILE%\\Desktop\n%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\n\nTarget extensions\n\n.7z\n.doc\n.docx\n.jsd\n.jst\n.jtd\n.odt\n.pdf\n.ppt\n.pptx\n.rar\n.rtf\n.xls\n.xlsx\n.zip\n\nBut the following directories are excluded, likely for the routine’s efficiency. Considering that TransBox’s purpose is to\nscan for “interesting” documents, the routine may have been designed to ignore these folders:\n\nC:\\Program Files\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\nC:\\PerfLogs\n\n\n-----\n\nC:\\Windows\nD:\\Program Files\nD:\\Program Files (x86)\nE:\\Program Files\nE:\\Program Files (x86)\n%APPDATA%\n\nTransBox implements another feature to record the file modification date in .ini format file to upload the target file\nagain when it is updated. The .ini file is created in the file path and contains the information in the format\n_%LOCALAPPDATA%\\sxda<Victim ID % 0x2710>.xso._\n\nFigure 8. .ini file used as database\n\n3.   Receiving commands\n\nTransBox can also receive backdoor commands via the Dropbox API. To receive a command, a destination file path in\nDropbox /<Victim ID decimal>/abox_.cxt was specified on sending GET request to the URL\n_hxxps://content.dropboxapi[.]com/2/files/download._\n\nFigure 9. Response format from command and control (C&C) server\nTransBox can perform the following capabilities based on the attacker’s backdoor commands:\n\nChange file upload size limitations and chunk sizes\nDownload DLL and execute in memory\nUpload files related to credentials for browsers such as Chrome or Firefox\nAdd extensions to collect\nUpload specified files or upload files with specific extensions under specified directories\nDisplay a list of files and directories under the specified directory\n\n\n-----\n\n**Incident 2**\n\nThe next case was observed around June 2022, also targeting researchers at a Japanese academic institution. In this\ncase, we observed the use of the MirrorKey variant introduced in the previous case study, and PlugBox malware,\nwhich also abuses the Dropbox API. As in the previous case study, the attacker intruded the targeted system and\ninstalled these malware.\n\nFigure 10. Execution flow of MirrorKey and PlugBox in Incident 2\n**MirrorKey (variant using Tiny Encryption Algorithm)**\n\nThe MirrorKey variant observed in this case was found in an infected system with the file name GTN.dll. This DLL is\nloaded in a similar manner to the DLL sideloading process used in the previous case. This time, the legitimate Google\napplication GoogleToolbarNotifier.exe, which exists in the same directory, was abused. Similar to the previous variant\nof MirrorKey, it searches for espui.dll existing in the same directory, which abuses CVE-2013-3900 to embed the\nencrypted payload. However, this variant uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) to decrypt the payload instead of AES.\nFurthermore, the code is completely different from that of the MirrorKey variant observed in March. While it can initially\nbe considered a different loader it partially shares common TTPs and code with the first observed variant.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PlugBox**\n\nThe decrypted payload is a DLL internally named LoadPlgFromRemote.dll. This DLL is dynamically loaded in memory\nby MirrorKey and starts executing when the export function Run is called.\n\nFigure 11. Original name embedded in DLL\nAnalysis revealed that this DLL, like TransBox, is a backdoor based on the Dropbox API.\n\n1.   Installation\n\nOn execution, it begins an installation process by making copies of the following files:\n\n%windir%\\SysWOW64\\cttune.exe -> %localappdata%\\NVIDIA\\cctune.exe\n<CURRENT_FOLDER>\\GTN.dll -> %localappdata%\\NVIDIA\\DWrite.dll\n<CURRENT_FOLDER>\\espui.dll -> %localappdata%\\NVIDIA\\espui.dll\n\nIn addition, it copies legitimate DLLs to the currently working directory and loads the DLLs. This process is\nmeaningless for the malicious activity and makes PlugBox look harmless. The legitimate DLLs copied are as follows:\n\n%windir%\\SysWOW64\\migration\\TableTextServiceMig.dll\n%windir%\\SysWOW64\\migration\\msctfmig.dll\n%windir%\\SysWOW64\\migration\\WMIMigrationPlugin.dll\n%windir%\\SysWOW64\\migration\\imjpmig.dll\n%windir%\\SysWOW64\\migration\\imkmig.dll\n%windir%\\SysWOW64\\migration\\tssysprep.dll\n%windir%\\SysWOW64\\migration\\cosetup.dll\n\n2.   Check-in\n\nNext, the attacker checks in to his Dropbox account by using a hard-coded API key. While TransBox embeds an\nAccess Token, PlugBox does not. Instead, it embeds Auth Token and Refresh Token, and uses these values to obtain\nan Access Token, which is required to access to the Dropbox over API.\n\nFigure 12. Obtaining an Access Token by using Refresh and Auth Tokens\n\n\n-----\n\nThen it generates a victim ID for each infected user to identify them when the users data is uploaded to Dropbox\nfollowing the steps below:\n\n1. Get the filepath of %temp% and replace \"\\\" with \"+\"\n2. Get the ProcessorId of the infected machine\n3. Get the SerialNumber of the infected machine’s motherboard\n4. Concatenate the strings above with \"\\r\\n\" and calculate SHA256 hash value\n5. Extract the first 32 bytes of the SHA256 hash value as victim ID\n\nThen, it sends an HTTP POST request to the URL hxxps://content[.]dropboxapi[.]com/2/files/upload with specific\ndetails /<Victim ID>/Victim ID>_<UNIXTIME>{1,3}.dat as the upload destination path.\n\nThen PlugBox uploads the following user information in plain text:\n\nFilepath of the %temp% (replacing \"\\\" with \"+\")\nProcessorId of the infected machine\nSerialNumber of the infected machine’s motherboard\n\n3.   Receiving commands\n\nTo receive backdoor commands, PlugBox sends an HTTP GET request to the URL\n_hxxps://content.dropboxapi[.]com/2/files/download with /<Victim ID>/<Victim ID>.cfg as the file path to download._\n\nThe supported features of PlugBox are the following:\n\nChange the interval to receive a command\nDownload encrypted DLL, decrypt them with TEA, and execute it in memory\nExecute arbitrary command\n\n**Incident 3**\n\nThe next case was observed around June and July in 2022, also targeting researchers in a Japanese academic\ninstitution. In this case, the dropper PULink and a new malware we called ShellBox were used. During our\ninvestigation, we found an ISO file containing the targeted user's name, suggesting that the attacker probably\nattempted to intrude in the system by having them download the ISO file in the email.\n\nFigure 13. List of the files in .iso\n\nThe ISO file contained an EXE file with a double extension, three DLLs (MSVCR100.DLL is harmless), and a decoy\ndocument. The EXE file was a legitimate Word application, but customized to sideload a DLL to load wwlib.dll in the\nsame directory. Once executed, the EXE file initiates the malicious routines.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. Execution flow if PULink and ShellBox in Incident 3\n**Dulload (Loader)**\n\nThe first DLL file loaded is wwlib.dll, a simple loader written in C++/CLR, designed to load Wordcnv.dll existing in the\nsame directory, and invokes the exported method MS_word.release_file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. Invoking the exported method of “Wordcnv.dll”\n**PULink (Loader)**\n\nThe exported method in Wordcnv.dll was designed to install the payloads and components (which is described later in\nthis entry). In this method, PULink decrypts the two embedded resource data with AES128-CBC and drops them in\n_%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Intel with the file names igfxxe.exe and igfx.dll._\n\nFigure 16. Invoked “release_file” method\nAES key and IV are generated through the following:\n\n1. Calculate MD5 hash of the hardcoded string\n2. Convert it to uppercase HEX string\n3. Encode the string generated in Step 2 in UTF-8 (-> becomes AES key)\n4. Cut out the 16 characters after the 9th character of the string generated in Step 2 and encode it in UTF-8 (->\n\nbecomes IV)\n\n\n-----\n\nThen, the loader creates a shortcut file in the Startup folder to achieve persistence, which contains the two dropped\nfiles in the command line\n\n%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Intel\\igfxxe.exe run %appdata%\\Microsoft\\Intel\\igfx.dll 0\nC:\\AppData\\Local\\Intel\\Games\\123;\n\nTo understand how this command line works, we need to look into igfxxe.exe. The igfxxe.exe was a renamed\nexecutable of the legitimate application GfxDownloadWrapper.exe shipped by Intel. Analysis of this EXE file revealed\nthat it was designed to invoke the specific export function ApplyRecommendedSettings of the DLL passed as an\n[argument. Note that this technique had already been reported by security community researcher bohops in 2020.](https://twitter.com/bohops/status/1318767376175976449)\n\nFigure 17. Method\n\nin igfxxe.exe invoking the specified DLL according to the argument\n**ShellBox**\n\n\"igfx.dll\", specified in the command line, is a stager written in C++ abusing the Dropbox API. ShellBox is completely\ndifferent from the ones that we observed in the previous cases except for the use of the Dropbox API. One trick for\nexample, ShellBox complicates the process of obtaining an access token of Dropbox API to make security analysts’\ninvestigation potentially hard. ShellBox does not have an Access Token or Refresh Token, but first accesses the\nspecific GitHub repository to obtain the URL where the Access Token for Dropbox is hosted. The hardcoded repository\nis hxxps://github[.]com/lettermaker/topsuggestions/blob/main/README.md.\n\nFigure 18. Attempts\n\nto obtain the second stage URL from the hardcoded GitHub repository\nAfter downloading the content from the repository, ShellBox extracts the encrypted string by the regular expression\nand decrypts it using the same AES decryption logic used in PULink. Around November 2022, we confirmed that the\nstring in the following image was embedded in the specified GitHub repository. When decrypted, we found the URL\n_hxxp://45[.]32[.]13[.]214/readme_v1.1.txt._\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19. File\n\nhosted in the GitHub repository (as of November 2022)\nUnfortunately, the decrypted second stage URL was already inaccessible during our investigation so we were unable\nto retrieve its contents. However, analyzing the ShellBox code, we can assume that this URL hosted a Dropbox\nAccess token encrypted with Base64 and AES in a similar manner.\n\nFigure 20. Obtaining an\n\nAccess Token from the second stage URL\nShellBox then downloads the AES-encrypted .NET assembly from Dropbox by specifying /d1/ml as the file path in\nDropbox, decrypts using the same logic as before, and executes in memory by using Assembly.Load method.\n\nFigure 21. Download and\n\nexecute the AES-encrypted .NET assembly\nAbused GitHub account\n\nWe investigated the GitHub account (with the username “lettermaker”) observed in this case and found that it has\nbeen active since approximately June 2022. Since only one repository exists, we believe that it was created\nspecifically for this campaign. Also, an examination of previous commits to the repository where the encrypted URL\nwas embedded in revealed that the URL path was different as of June.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22. URL possibly\n\nused in June 2022\nUpon checking on the commit log of this repository, we found that the attacker was working in a UTC+9 environment.\nHowever, it should be noted that this artifact is also easy to disguise, so it can be a false flag.\n\nFigure 23.\n\nCommit log in UTC+9\nPossible Attribution\n\nThe following image summarizes the characteristics of Earth Yako as of January 2023.\n\nFigure 24. Diamond model of Earth Yako\n\n\n-----\n\n**Technical perspectives**\n\nBased on the arsenals and TTPs, we believe Earth Yako may be related to a number of existing groups. However,\nsince we could only observe partial technical overlaps between Earth Yako and the following groups, we note that this\nis not our final attribution. We found the overlaps similar with the following groups:\n\n1.   Darkhotel\n\n[Darkhotel (a.k.a.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/darkhotel-malware-emphasizes-the-importance-of-using-secure-networks-while-travelling) [DUBNIUM) is a threat actor observed to frequently target Japanese organizations in the past. Earth](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0012/)\nYako’s method for initial access is similar to the procedure used by Darkhotel, which has been confirmed in other\n[reports.](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2019/06/darkhotel-lnk.html)\n\n2.   APT10\n\n[APT10 (also known as menuPass, Stone Panda, Potassium, Red Apollo, CVNX, and ChessMaster) is a threat actor](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/operation-cloud-hopper-what-you-need-to-know)\nthat has been actively attacking organizations in Japan, especially from 2016 to 2018. Trend Micro's analysis has\nconfirmed that Earth Yako’s MirrorKey malware uses the same encryption routine as the one used by APT10 malware\nfamilies [RedLeaves and](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2017/04/redleaves---malware-based-on-open-source-rat.html) [ChChes in the past. However, there is no strong evidence that APT10 originally developed](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/17/g/chessmaster-cyber-espionage-campaign.html)\nthis routine, or that they possibly just reused a code from a publicly available library.\n\n3.   APT29\n\n[APT29 (also known as IRON RITUAL, IRON HEMLOCK, NobleBaron, Dark Halo, StellarParticle, NOBELIUM,](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/d/mitre-evaluation2020.html)\nUNC2452, YTTRIUM, The Dukes, Cozy Bear, and CozyDuke) is a threat actor known to target Western government\norganizations. In 2022, APT29 used ISO and LNK files for initial access, similar to the TTPs of Earth Yako. It has also\nbeen [reported](https://blog.cluster25.duskrise.com/2022/05/13/cozy-smuggled-into-the-box) [to abuse Dropbox API as a C&C server for malware. However, we confirmed that the codes of the](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cloaked-ursa-online-storage-services-campaigns/)\nmalware from APT29 is itself different from those of Earth Yako-related malware (TransBox, PlugBox, and ShellBox).\n\n**Other considerations**\n\nIn addition to the technical similarities identified, we also look at the context surrounding the incidents. In attacking the\nacademic and research sectors in Japan, and the fact that they target various industries based on the international\naffairs is similar to APT10. We observed lures using themes or discussions on economic security, energy, the RussiaUkraine conflict, or other significant events surrounding East Asia. The threat actor has been conducting attacks using\nthe [LODEINFO](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2021/02/LODEINFO-3.html) [malware in recent years. In particular, the attacks by Earth Yako and the attacks using LODEINFO are](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/12/14/unmasking-mirrorface-operation-liberalface-targeting-japanese-political-entities/)\n[similar, and it has been reported that the organizations Earth Yako targeted were also the institutions involved in](https://www.ipa.go.jp/files/000106897.pdf)\ncompromises using LODEINFO malware. However, as with the limitations identified in the \"Technical Perspectives”\nsection, we believe this is insufficient to connect Earth Yako with APT10.\n\nConclusion\n\nSince 2022, Earth Yako has been actively attacking with new arsenal and TTPs. Although the targets of the\ncompromise vary from time to time, it is believed that it commonly targets the academic and research sectors in\nJapan, both individuals belonging to these organizations and institutions as a whole. In November 2022, the National\n[Police Agency and the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) issued a warning](https://www.nisc.go.jp/pdf/press/20221130NISC_press.pdf)\nabout these attacks. One of the characteristics of the recent targeted attacks is that they shifted to targeting the\nindividuals considered to have relatively weak security measures compared to companies and other organizations.\nThis shift to targeting individuals over enterprises is highlighted by the targeting and abuse of Dropbox as it is\nconsidered a popular service in the region among users for personal use, but not for organizations.\n\nIt should also be noted that Earth Yako has been actively changing their targets and methods based on the significant\ntopics concerning the targeted countries. For the targeted attacks, in addition to the groups continuously targeting the\nspecific regions and industries, we identified several groups changing their targets and methods based on the current\ncircumstances, including Earth Yako.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo mitigate the risks and impact of compromise from targeted compromise, it is necessary to not only focus on specific\nmethods, malware, and threat actors, but also to collect a wider range of information, implement continuous monitoring\nand countermeasures, and inspect attack surfaces in organizations. We believe that attacks by Earth Yako are still\nongoing, and therefore we believe that continued vigilance is necessary.\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n**SHA256** **Detection**\n\nf38c367e6e4e7f6e20fa7a3ce0d8501277f5027f93e46761e72c36ec709f4304 Trojan.Win32.MIRRORKEY.ZJJH\n\nbdc15b09b78093a1a5503a1a7bfb487f7ef4ca2cb8b4d1d1bdf9a54cdc87fae4 TrojanSpy.Win32.TRANSBOX.ZJJH.enc\n\nDomains/IP addresses\n\ndriveshoster[.]com\ndisknxt[.]com\n45[.]32[.]13[.]214\nhxxps://github[.]com/lettermaker/topsuggestions/blob/main/README.md\n\n[See the applicable Yara rule here.](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/23/invitation-to-a-secret-event-uncovering-earth-yako-campaigns/YaraRule-invitation-to-secret-event-uncovering-earth-yako-campaigns.yara)\n\n\n-----",
