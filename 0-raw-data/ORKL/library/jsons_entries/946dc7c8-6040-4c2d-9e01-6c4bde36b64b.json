data”\n\n**[nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2021/08/06/conti-ransomware-affiliate-goes-rogue-leaks-company-data/](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2021/08/06/conti-ransomware-affiliate-goes-rogue-leaks-company-data/)**\n\nBy Paul Ducklin 06 Aug 2021\n\nIf you like a touch of irony in your cybersecurity news, then this has been the week for it.\n\n[Yesterday, we wrote about an exploitable security hole…](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2021/08/05/cobalt-strike-network-attack-tool-patches-crashtastic-server-bug/)\n\n…inside a hacking tool that helps you exploit security holes.\n\nToday, we’re writing about a ransomware-related data breach that leaked organisational\ninformation…\n\n…from inside a ransomware group.\n\nAnd if that’s not enough to bring a wry smile to your lips, then there’s more.\n\nToday’s data breach includes a bunch of hacking tools that ransomware crooks love to use…\n\n[…including a buggy and exploitable pirated version of the very attack tool that we wrote](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2021/08/05/cobalt-strike-network-attack-tool-patches-crashtastic-server-bug/)\nabout yesterday!\n\n## Simply told\n\nThe story, it seems, is [simply told.](https://therecord.media/disgruntled-ransomware-affiliate-leaks-the-conti-gangs-technical-manuals/)\n\n\n-----\n\nAs you already know, many of today s ransomware attacks aren t conducted by the core\ncriminals who actually write the malware code.\n\nThe core crooks like to keep out of the limelight by recruiting “affiliates” to handle the actual\nnetwork intrusions.\n\n(These cybergangs often use regular business vocabulary, even referring to their victims as\n“customers” and describing their extortion attempts as “negotiations”.)\n\nIn theory, affiliates can get really rich, because they typically get paid 70% of any ransom that\ngets extorted – and individual ransoms can run into millions of dollars these days.\n\nAnd in practice, the core criminals – the ones who write the malware, operate the “affiliate\nsystem”, and collect the Bitcoin blackmail payments – can get super-rich, because they get\n30% of everything.\n\n[However, according to The Record, which published a screenshot of a post in a cybercrime](https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/XSS-Conti-leak.png)\nforum by a user discussing the Conti ransomware crew:\n\nYes, of course they recruit suckers and divide the money among themselves, and the\nboys are fed with what they will let them know when the victim pays.\n\nThe implication, clearly, is that affiliates in the Conti ransomware crew are not being paid\n70% of the actual ransom amount, but 70% of an imaginary but lower number.\n\nThe critical user followed up the post above with one linking to an 81MByte archive file\nnamed `Мануали для работяг и софт.rar (Operating manuals and software).`\n\nDishonour amongst thieves, it seems.\n\n## No vital secrets\n\nUltimately, the data leaked by the disaffected affiliate doesn’t really amount to much.\n\nThe criminals at the core of so-called ransomware-as-a-service groups keep the source\ncode, the decryption keys and the blackmail payment details to themselves.\n\nSo, this leak won’t help any ransomware victims to decrypt scrambled files without paying.\n\nIn fact, if you are minded to get a copy of the leaked files for yourself to see what this is all\nabout, in the hope that it might give you some tricks and tips for defending against\nransomware that you didn’t already know…\n\n…please be careful, because the files include numerous hacking and system exploitation\ntools, conveniently collected in one place, together with instructions and advice (mostly\nwritten in Russian).\n\n\n-----\n\nThink of it as a dump of the Conti gang s community knowledgebase, with plenty of risky\nsoftware thrown in.\n\nIf you’re a Sophos customer, you can use the following detection names to search your own\nlogs for the tools included in the breach:\n```\nATK/PowSploit-E  <-- Kerberoast, used for attacking Active Directory logons\nATK/Cobalt-*    <-- \"Cobalt Strike\", a complete botnet system for \"threat\nemulation\"\nATK/Shellcode-*  <-- Exploit injectors included in Cobalt Strike\nTroj/Agent-*    <-- Various backdoor \"zombie\" modules include in Cobalt Strike\nGMER        <-- Popular detector/remover for rootkits (and security software)\nHarmony Loader   <-- Toolkit for fileless execution of programs via C-Sharp\nPC Hunter     <-- Low-level security spelunking tool\nPowerTool     <-- Another low-level security spelunking tool\nStas'M Router Scan <-- Scans and looks for holes in routers, Wi-Fi access points and\nmore\n\n```\nDocuments leaked in the breach offer basic advice on numerous topics, including:\n\nDumping password hashes.\nTurning Defender off by hand.\nInstalling and using Metasploit.\nScanning networks for backup devices.\nOpening backdoors into a compromised network.\nUsing popular exploits.\nElevating privilege.\nListing users.\n\nThere’s also a small collection of tools for disabling or uninstalling various anti-virus\nprograms.\n\nThere’s even a dramatically named batch file called `DIEsophos.bat in the mix. (It’s hard to`\nknow whether to be proud or angry that the criminals felt strongly enough to use CAPITAL\nLETTERS in their filename.)\n\n[According to our Managed Threat Response (MTR) team, if Sophos customers have Tamper](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/27/mtr-casebook-an-active-adversary-caught-in-the-act/)\nProtection enabled, then the anti-Sophos measures in the leaked documents won’t work,\neven if the attacker is already an Admin and can get into Windows Safe Mode. If you aren’t\n[using Tamper Protection, we recommend you turn it on now.](https://docs.sophos.com/central/Customer/help/en-us/central/Customer/concepts/ep_TamperProtection.html)\n\n## What to do?\n\nWe’re going to repeat the advice that we gave yesterday in the wake of the Cobalt Strike\nbug:\n\n\n-----\n\nIf your security tools come up with a Cobalt Strike alert, or reports that relate to any of\nthe techniques and tools that we mentioned above, we recommend that you\ninvestigate immediately, even if your cybersecurity software tells you that it\nautomatically blocked and removed the rogue software that caused the alert.\n\nThat’s because intrusions of this sort mean that someone was trying to establish a\nbeachhead inside your network, perhaps for a ransomware attack, perhaps for a data\nheist, perhaps for both, or perhaps for a range of other criminal activity, too…\n\n…and if they got in once, it’s reasonable to assume that if you don’t find and close the\ndoor on them, they (or someone else) will get in again, because that’s quite literally\nwhat cybercrooks do for a living.\n\n**The good news here is that the leaked data doesn’t really tell us anything we didn’t already**\nknow, or introduce any new tools or techniques that the typical cybercrook didn’t already\nknow about, either.\n\n**The bad news here, of course, is that the leaked data doesn’t really tell us anything we**\ndidn’t already know.\n\nSo if you were hoping that the leak was going to be juicy enough to include free decryption\nkeys, or personally identifiable data that might help law enforcement to track down some of\nthese criminals…\n\n…not this time, we’re sorry to say.\n\n\n-----",
