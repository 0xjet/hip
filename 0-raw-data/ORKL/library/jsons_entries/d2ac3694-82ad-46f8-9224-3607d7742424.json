Based on the mutexes and domain names of some of their C&C servers,\nBlackTech’s campaigns are likely designed to steal their target’s technology.\n\nFollowing their activities and evolving tactics and techniques helped us uncover the proverbial red string of\nfate that connected three seemingly disparate campaigns: PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and of late,\nWaterbear.\n\nOver the course of their campaigns, we analyzed their modus operandi and dissected their tools of the trade—\nand uncovered common denominators indicating that PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and Waterbear may\nactually be operated by the same group.\n\n**_PLEAD_**\nPLEAD is an information theft campaign with a penchant for confidential documents. Active since 2012, it\nhas so far targeted Taiwanese government agencies and private organizations. PLEAD’s toolset includes the\nself-named PLEAD backdoor and the DRIGO exfiltration tool. PLEAD uses spear-phishing emails to deliver\nand install their backdoor, either as an attachment or through links to cloud storage services. Some of the\ncloud storage accounts used to deliver PLEAD are also used as drop off points for exfiltrated documents\nstolen by DRIGO.\n\nPLEAD’s installers are disguised as documents using the [right-to-left-override (RTLO) technique to](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/09/right-to-left-override-aids-email-attacks/)\nobfuscate the malware’s filename. They are mostly accompanied by decoy documents to further trick users.\nWe’ve also seen PLEAD use exploits for these vulnerabilities:\n\n[CVE-2015-5119, patched by Adobe last July, 2015](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/unpatched-flash-player-flaws-more-pocs-found-in-hacking-team-leak/)\n[CVE-2012-0158, patched by Microsoft last April, 2012](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/cve-2012-0158-exploitation-seen-in-various-global-campaigns/)\n[CVE-2014-6352, patched by Microsoft last October, 2014](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/microsoft-windows-hit-by-new-zero-day-attack/)\n[CVE-2017-0199, patched by Microsoft last April, 2017](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/april-patch-tuesday-microsoft-patches-office-vulnerability-used-zero-day-attacks/)\n\nPLEAD also dabbled with a short-lived, fileless version of their malware when it obtained an exploit for a\n[Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) that was](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/unpatched-flash-player-flaws-more-pocs-found-in-hacking-team-leak/) [leaked during the Hacking Team breach.](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/hacking-team-flash-zero-day-integrated-into-exploit-kits/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: How PLEAD utilizes compromised routers_\n\nPLEAD actors use a router scanner tool to scan for vulnerable routers, after which the attackers will enable\nthe router’s VPN feature then register a machine as virtual server. This virtual server will be used either as a\nC&C server or an HTTP server that delivers PLEAD malware to their targets.\n\nPLEAD also uses CVE-2017-7269, a buffer overflow vulnerability Microsoft Internet Information Services\n(IIS) 6.0 to compromise the victim’s server. This is another way for them to establish a new C&C or HTTP\nserver.\n\n_Figure 2: One of the methods PLEAD operators use to distribute their malware_\n\nPLEAD’s backdoor can:\n\nHarvest saved credentials from browsers and email clients like Outlook\nList drives, processes, open windows, and files\nOpen remote Shell\nUpload target file\nExecute applications via ShellExecute API\nDelete target file\n\n\n-----\n\nmachine for documents. Each copy of DRIGO contains a refresh token tied to specific Gmail accounts used\nby the attackers, which are in turn linked to a Google Drive account. The stolen files are uploaded to these\nGoogle Drives, where the attackers can harvest them.\n\n**_Shrouded Crossbow_**\nThis campaign, first observed in 2010, is believed to be operated by a well-funded group given how it\nappeared to have [purchased the source code of the BIFROST backdoor, which the operators enhanced and](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-targeted-attack-group-buys-bifrose-code-works-in-teams/)\ncreated other tools from. Shrouded Crossbow targeted privatized agencies and government contractors as\nwell as enterprises in the consumer electronics, computer, healthcare, and financial industries.\n\nShrouded Crossbow employs three BIFROST-derived backdoors: BIFROSE, KIVARS, and XBOW. Like\nPLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow uses spear-phishing emails with backdoor-laden attachments that utilize the\nRTLO technique and accompanied by decoy documents.\n\n[BIFROSE, known for evading detection by communicating with its C&C servers via Tor protocol, also has](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/threat-actors-behind-shrouded-crossbow-creates-bifrose-for-unix/) a\nversion targeting UNIX-based operating systems, which are usually used in servers, workstations, and mobile\ndevices. KIVARS has less functionality than BIFROSE, but its modular structure made it easier to maintain.\nKIVARS enabled attackers to download and execute files, list drives, uninstall malware service, take\nscreenshots, activate/deactivate keylogger, show/hide active windows, and trigger mouse clicks and keyboard\ninputs. [A 64-bit version of KIVARS also emerged to keep pace with the popularity of 64-bit systems.](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/kivars-with-venom-targeted-attacks-upgrade-with-64-bit-support/)\nXBOW’s capabilities are derived from BIFROSE and KIVARS; Shrouded Crossbow gets its name from its\nunique mutex format.\n\n**_Waterbear_**\nWaterbear has actually been operating for a long time. The campaign’s name is based on its malware’s\ncapability to equip additional functions remotely.\n\nWaterbear similarly employs a modular approach to its malware. A loader component executable will\nconnect to the C&C server to download the main backdoor and load it in memory. A later version of this\nmalware appeared and [used patched server applications as its loader component, while the main backdoor is](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/attack-gains-foothold-against-east-asian-government-through-auto-start/)\neither loaded from an encrypted file or downloaded from the C&C server.\n\nThe tactic it later adopted required prior knowledge of their targets’ environment. It’s possible attackers used\nWaterbear as a secondary payload to help maintain presence after gaining some levels of access into the\ntargets’ systems.\n\n**_All Roads Lead to BlackTech_**\nBased on the use of the same C&C servers, the campaigns’ coordinated efforts, and similarities in tools,\ntechniques, and objectives, we can conclude that they are operated by the same group. It is not uncommon,\nfor instance, for a group—especially a well-funded one—to split into teams and run multiple campaigns.\nWhile most of the campaigns’ attacks are conducted separately, we’ve seen apparently joint operations\nconducted in phases that entail the work of different teams at each point in the infection chain.\n\n**_Use of the Same C&C Servers. In several instances, we found the campaigns’ malware communicating with_**\nthe same C&C servers. In targeted attacks, C&C servers are typically not shared with other groups. Here are\nsome of the C&C servers we found that are shared by the campaigns:\n\n**C&C Server** **PLEAD** **Shrouded Crossbow** **Waterbear**\nitaiwans[.]com Yes No Yes\nmicrosoftmse[.]com Yes Yes No\n211[.]72[.]242[.]120 Yes Yes No\n\n_Table 1: C&C servers shared by PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and Waterbear_\n\nAdditionally, the IP 211[.]72 [.]242[.]120 is one of the hosts for the domain microsoftmse[.]com, which has\nbeen used by several KIVARS variants.\n\n\n-----\n\npossible for separate groups to attack at the same time, we can construe at they are at least working together:\n\n**PLEAD** **Shrouded Crossbow**\n\nLoader component named\n\nLoader component named\n\n_Samples from the same group_ after its target, i.e. {target\n\nafter its target, i.e. {target\n\n_using the same filename_ _name}.exe or {target_\n\n_name}.exe_\n\n_name}64.exe_\n_Backdoors using the same_ Connected to Connected to\n_C&C servers_ 211[.]72[.]242[.]120:53 211[.]72[.]242[.]120:443\n\n\n_Timeline indicating arrival_\n_order_\n\n\nArrived two days after initial\ninfection by SC\n\n\nEstablished presence two\nyears prior, but re-infected at\na recent time\n\n\n_Table 2: Incident where PLEAD and KIVARS attack the same target_\n\n**PLEAD** **Shrouded Crossbow** **Waterbear**\n_Samples found in_\n\n_vmdks.exe_ _cfbcjtqx.dll_ _tpauto.dll_\n_same machine_\n\n_Timeline of infection_ 3/16/2017 2/23/2017 3/8/2017\n\n_Table 3: Incidents where PLEAD, KIVARS, and Waterbear were used on the same target_\n\n**_Similarities between tools and techniques. PLEAD and KIVARS, for instance, share the use of RTLO_**\ntechniques to disguise their installers as documents. Both also use decoy documents to make the RTLO attack\nmore convincing. Another similarity is the use of a small loader component to load encrypted backdoors into\nmemory.\n\n**_Similar Objectives. The ulterior motive of these campaigns is to steal important documents from their_**\nvictims; initial recipients of their attacks are not always their primary target. For instance, we saw several\ndecoy documents stolen by the attackers that are then used against another target. This indicates that\ndocument theft is most likely the first phase of an attack chain against a victim with ties to the intended\ntarget. While PLEAD and KIVARS are most likely to be used in first phase attacks, Waterbear can be seen as\na secondary backdoor installed after attackers have gained a certain level of privilege.\n\nBased on the type of documents stolen by these campaigns, we can get a clearer view of who they’re\ntargeting and compromising, the purpose of their campaigns, and when they take place. Below are some of\nthe categories or labels of the stolen documents:\n\n\nAddress book\nBudget\nBusiness\nContract\nCulture\nDefense\nEducation\nEnergy\nForeign affairs\nFunding application\nHuman affairs\n\n\nInternal affairs\nLaws\nLivelihood economy\nMeeting\nOfficial letter\nPassword list\nPerformance appraisal\nPhysical culture\nPress release\nPublic security\nSchedule\n\n\n**_Enterprises Need to be Proactive_**\nPLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and Waterbear are still actively mounting their campaigns against its targets,\nwhich is why organizations must proactively secure their perimeter.\n\nIT/system administrators and information security professionals can consider making a checklist of what to\nlook out for in the network for any signs of anomalies and suspicious behavior that can indicate intrusions.\nAd i b i d l i l il [d](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/four-steps-to-an-effective-targeted-attack-response/) i h i d i i d\n\n\n-----\n\nprevention systems, [network segmentation, and](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/identifying-and-dividing-networks-and-users/) [data categorization are just some of them.](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/identifying-and-dividing-networks-and-users/)\n\n**_Trend Micro Solutions_**\n\n[Trend Micro™](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/security-risk-management/deep-discovery/) [Deep Discovery™ provides detection, in-depth analysis, and proactive response to today’s](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/security-risk-management/deep-discovery/)\nstealthy malware, and targeted attacks in real-time.
