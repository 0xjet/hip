Any new\ncountry in southeast Asia being targeted by Bitter APT shouldn't be of surprise.\"\n\nBitter (aka APT-C-08 or T-APT-17) is suspected to be a South Asian hacking group\nmotivated primarily by intelligence gathering, an operation that's facilitated by means of\nmalware such as BitterRAT, ArtraDownloader, and AndroRAT. Prominent targets include the\nenergy, engineering, and government sectors.\n\nThe earliest attacks distributing the mobile version of BitterRAT date back to September\n[2014, with the actor having a history of leveraging zero-day flaws — CVE-2021-1732 and](https://blog.cyble.com/2021/02/24/bitter-apt-enhances-its-capability-with-windows-kernel-zero-day-exploit/)\n[CVE-2021-28310 — to its advantage and accomplishing its adversarial objectives.](https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/nsa-discovers-new-vulnerabilities.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe latest campaign, targeting an elite entity of the Bangladesh government, involves\nsending spear-phishing emails to high-ranking officers of the Rapid Action Battalion Unit of\nthe Bangladesh police (RAB).\n\nAs is typically observed in other social engineering attacks of this kind, the missives are\ndesigned to lure the recipients into opening a weaponized RTF document or a Microsoft\nExcel spreadsheet that exploits previously known flaws in the software to deploy a new\ntrojan dubbed \"ZxxZ.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nZxxZ, named so after a separator used by the malware when sending information back to the\nC2 server, is a 32-bit Windows executable compiled in Visual C++.\n\n\"The trojan masquerades as a Windows Security update service and allows the malicious\nactor to perform remote code execution, allowing the attacker to perform any other activities\nby installing other tools,\" the researchers explained.\n\nWhile the malicious RTF document exploits a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft\n[Office's Equation Editor (CVE-2017-11882), the Excel file abuses two remote code execution](https://thehackernews.com/2017/11/microsoft-office-rce-exploit.html)\nflaws, [CVE-2018-0798 and](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2018-0798) [CVE-2018-0802, to activate the infection sequence.](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2018-0802)\n\n\"Actors often change their tools to avoid detection or attribution, this is part of the lifecycle of\na threat actor showing its capability and determination,\" Ventura said.\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n[cybersecurity,](https://thehackernews.com/search/label/cybersecurity) [hacking news](https://thehackernews.com/search/label/hacking%20news)\n\n\n-----",
