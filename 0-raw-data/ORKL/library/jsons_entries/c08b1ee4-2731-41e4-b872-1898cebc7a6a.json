The version of Buer\nbeing leveraged for these campaigns has more updates being done to it that appear to be\ncompletely designed around an enterprise focus. One such piece that hasn’t been discussed\nvery publicly is that Buer also has a component that is frequently delivered in memory as a task\nand communicates with the same C2 as Buer but over a different port.\n\n## DomainInfo\n\nEnter Buers ‘DomainInfo’ component which is ultimately designed to profile some information\nabout the infected system and the network that it is joined to.\n\nThe data gathered is constructed into a JSON blob listing ‘Id’, ‘Domains’, ‘Group’ and ‘Server’.\n\nBelow is the table explaining what data is harvested:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter all the data has been collected it will simply post it off to the C2, in doing so a hardcoded\nUser-Agent is passed in.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe User-Agent ends up being pretty weird looking but as it turns out the Buer sample that\ndelivered this file had the same User-Agent.\n\nTraffic example:\n```\nPOST: /api/v1/modules/domains/dnsUser-Agent: Rt\\x7fnqqf4:35%Fuuqj2nUmtsj<H74675739;;@%Z@%HUZ%qnpj%Rfh%TX%]@%js.%Fuuqj\\\\jgPny49750%PMYRQ1%qnpj%Ljhpt.%[jwxnts4835%Rtgnqj46F:98%Xfkfwn496>38{ \"Id\":\n\"e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855\" \"Domains\": { \n\"DomainsError\": \"\", \"DomainsNetBios\": [\"\"], \"DomainsDns\": [\"\"] }, \"Group\": { \n\"JoinStatus\": \"NetSetupWorkgroupName\", \"GroupType\": \"WORKGROUP\" }, \"Server\": { \n\"PCNames\": [\"\"] }}\n\n## ShellCode\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nShellcode as a task in Buer has been around but its addition in a bot being leveraged for\nprimarily distributing CobaltStrike makes complete sense as removing a middle man separate\nstager and allowing Buer to directly load stager shellcode or even a reflectively loaded beacon\ndirectly.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Spammer Workplace\n\nBuer now also includes the ability to help with spamming through the creation of document\nbased loaders and various delivery chains from the panel:\n\n\n-----\n\nInside the spammer workshop binaries can also be leveraged such as the recently mentioned\nRust based loader version from ProofPoint[6]. Buer loader has been one of the most actively\ndeveloped and updated loaders that we have tracked in 2021.\n\n## IOCs\n\nC2s:\n```\nitmanagersupporter[.]clickhxxps://officewestunionbank[.]com/api/v1/modules/domains/dnshxx\n\n```\nDomainInfo hashes:\n```\n38a41e8128ae3955d541c8a00a93de1cd10a01c58368c8254a35659f8627ba30\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nRelated OSINT campaigns:\n\n## References\n\n1:https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/buer-new-loader-emerges-undergroundmarketplace\n\n2:https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/28/hacks-for-sale-inside-the-buer-loader-malwareas-a-service/\n\n3:https://medium.com/walmartglobaltech/cobaltstrike-stager-utilizing-floating-point-math9bc13f9b9718\n\n[4:https://twitter.com/vk_intel/status/1262618254251614215?lang=en](https://twitter.com/vk_intel/status/1262618254251614215?lang=en)\n\n[5:https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1359689043735416835?s=20](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1359689043735416835?s=20)\n\n[6:https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/new-variant-buer-loader-written-rust](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/new-variant-buer-loader-written-rust)\n\n\n-----",
