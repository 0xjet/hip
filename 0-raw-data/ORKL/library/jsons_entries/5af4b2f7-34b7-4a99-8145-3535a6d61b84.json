Its victims are all involved with China’s foreign relations in some way, and are\ngenerally caught through spear-phishing or watering hole attacks.\n\nOverall, the activities of this actor show that low investment and ready-made offensive toolsets can be very effective\nwhen combined with high quality social engineering. We have seen more such open source toolset dependency\nwith meterpreter and BeEF, and expect to see this trend continue.\n\n## The Attack Method: Infection Vector\n\nDropping Elephant uses two main infection vectors that share a common, and fairly elaborately maintained, social\nengineering theme – foreign relations with China.\n\nThe first approach involves spear-phishing targets using a document with remote content. As soon as the user\nopens the document, a “ping” request is sent to the attackers’ server. At this point, the attackers know the user has\nopened the document and send another spear-phishing email, this time containing an MS Word document with an\nembedded executable. The Word document usually exploits CVE-2012-0158. Sometimes the attackers send an MS\nPowerPoint document instead, which exploits CVE-2014-6352.\n\nOnce the payload is executed, an UPX packed AutoIT executable is dropped. Upon execution, this downloads\nadditional components from the attackers’ servers. Then the stealing of documents and data begins.\n\nThe second approach involves capturing victims through watering hole attacks. The actor created a website that\ndownloads genuine news articles from other websites. If a website visitor wants to view the whole article they would\nneed to download a PowerPoint document. This reveals the rest of the article, but also asks the visitor to download a\nmalicious artifact.\n\nThe two main infection vectors are supported by other approaches. Sometimes, the attackers email out links to their\nwatering hole websites. They also maintain Google+, Facebook and twitter accounts to develop relevant SEO and to\nreach out to wider targets. Occasionally, these links get retweeted, indiscriminately bringing more potential victims to\ntheir watering holes.\n\n## The Attack Tools\n\n### 1. Malware Analysis\n\nThe backdoor is usually UPX packed but still quite large in size. The reason for this is that most of the file comprises\nmeaningless overlay data, since the file is an automatically generated AutoIT executable with an AutoIT3 script\nembedded inside. Once started, it downloads additional malware from the C2 and also uploads some basic system\ninformation, stealing, among other things, the user’s Google Chrome credentials. The backdoor also pings the C2\nserver at regular intervals. A good security analyst can spot this while analyzing firewall log files and thereby find out\n\n\n-----\n\nexecutables/libraries. But, in the case of Dropping Elephant, the backdoor downloads encoded blobs that are then\ndecoded to powershell command line “scripts”. These scripts are run and, in turn download the additional malware.\n\nOne of the more interesting malware samples downloaded is the file-stealer module. When this file-stealer is\nexecuted, it makes another callback to the C2 server, downloading and executing yet another malware sample. It\nrepeatedly attempts to iterate through directories and to collect files with the following extensions: doc, docx, ppt,\npptx, pps, ppsx, xls, xlsx, and pdf. These files are then uploaded to the C2 server.\n\nAlso interesting are the resilient communications used by this group. Much like the known actors Miniduke or\nCommentCrew, it hides base64 encoded and encrypted control server locations in comments on legitimate web\nsites. However, unlike the previous actors, the encrypted data provides information about the next hop, or the true\nC2 for the backdoor, instead of initial commands.\n\n### 2. C2 Analysis\n\nIn many cases it was very difficult to get a good overview of the campaign and to find out how successful it is. By\ncombining KSN data with partner-provided C2 server data, we were able to obtain a much fuller picture of the\nincident.\n\nWe examined connections and attack logins to this particular C2. As it turned out, the attackers often logged in via a\nVPN, but sometimes via IPs belonging to an ordinary ISP in India. We then looked at the time the attackers were\nactive, of which you can find an image below.\n\n## Victim Profile and Geography\n\nWe also wanted to get a better idea of the geolocation of most visitors. Analysis of the image provided access counts\nand times, along with the IP of the visiting system.\n\nNoteworthy are the many IPs located in China. This focus on China-related foreign relations was apparent from the\nongoing social engineering themes that were constant throughout the attacks. The concentration of visits from CN\n(People’s Republic of China) could be for a variety of reasons – diplomatic staff are visiting these sites from their CN\n\n\n-----\n\nable to determine that multiple targets are diplomatic and governmental entities, these foreign relations efforts are\nlikely to represent the main interest of the attackers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCampaigns do not always need to be technically advanced to be successful. In this case, a small group reusing\nexploit code, some powershell-based malware and mostly social engineering has been able to steal sensitive\ndocuments and data from victims since at least November 2015.\n\nOur analysis of the C2 server confirmed the high profile of most victims, mainly based in the Asian region and\nspecially focused on Chinese interests. Actually, some hints suggest the group has been successful enough to have\nrecently expanded its operations, perhaps after proving its effectiveness and the value of the data stolen.\n\nThis is quite worrying, especially given the fact that no 0 days or advanced techniques were used against such high\nprofile targets. Simply applying software patches will prevent attacks based on old exploits, as well as training in the\nmost basic social engineering attacks.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that in this case Microsoft´s patch for exploit CVE-2014-1761 just warns the user not to\nallow the execution of the suspicious file.\n\nDropping Elephant artifacts are detected by Kaspersky Lab products as:\nExploit.Win32.CVE-2012-0158.*\nExploit.MSWord.CVE-2014-1761.*\nTrojan-Downloader.Win32.Genome.*\nHEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic\n\nAs usual Kaspersky Lab actively collaborates with CERTs and LEAs to notify victims and help to mitigate the threat.\nIf you need more information about this actor, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com\n\nMore information on how Kaspersky Lab technologies protect against such cyberespionage attacks is available on\nKaspersky Business blog.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n###
