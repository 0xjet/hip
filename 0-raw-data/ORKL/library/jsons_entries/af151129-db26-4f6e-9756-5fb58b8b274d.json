The filename of the attachment in e-mail had password included, which\nis similar to that of phishing e-mail distributed last February (see the link below).\n\n[LockBit Ransomware Being Distributed Using Resume and Copyright-related Emails](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/32054/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. E-mail details\nAs shown in Figure 2, the phishing e-mail has a compressed file as an attachment that\ncontains another compressed file inside.\n\nFigure 2. Inside the compressed file\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon decompressing the file in the compressed file, an executable disguised using a PDF\nfile icon is found.\n\nFigure 3. Executable disguised as a PDF file\n\nAs shown in Figure 4, this file is confirmed to be a NSIS File. Looking into the nsi script\ndetail, it decodes the data file ‘162809383’ and performs malicious behaviors through\nrecursions and injections.\n\nFigure 4.\n\nInside the NSIS file\n\nFigure 5. Part of nsi script\n\nThis ransomware prevents recovery by deleting volume shadow copy. Furthermore, to make\nsure the ransomware runs continuously, it registers Run Key to registry and drops\nLockBit_Ransomware.hta on the desktop to keep it running even after a desktop change or a\nreboot.\n\nbcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures\n\nbcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled no\n\nvssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet\n\nwmic shadowcopy delete\n\nTable 1. Execution command\n\nFigure 6.

Terminated services\n\nwinword.exe, QBDBMgr.exe, 360doctor.exe, Adobe Desktop Service.exe,\nAutorunsc64a.exe, Sysmon.exe, Sysmon64.exe, procexp64a, procexp64a.exe,\nprocmon.exe, procmon64.exe, procmon64a, procmon64a.exe, Raccine_x86,\nProcessHacker.exe and etc.\n\nTable 3. Terminated processes\n\nThe encryption happens after certain services and processes are terminated. If the drive type\nis DRIVE_REMOVABLE, DRIVE_FIXED, or DRIVE_RAMDISK, it will also be encrypted.\nExtensions and name of folders or files that are excluded from encryption are as follows:\n\nsystem volume information, windows photo viewer, windowspowershell, internet explorer,\nwindows security, windows defender, $recycle.bin, Mozilla, msbuild, appdata, windows and\netc.\n\nTable 4. Folders excluded from encryption\n\n.mp4 .mp3 .reg .ini .idx .cur .drv .sys .ico .lnk .dll .exe .lock .lockbit .sqlite .accdb .lzma\n.zipx .7z .db and etc.\n\nTable 5. Extensions excluded from encryption\n\nEncrypted files have an extension named .lockbit and a certain icon. Also, a ransom note\nnamed ‘Restore-My-Files.txt’ is created in the encrypted folder.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Ransom note\n\nFigure 8. When infected by ransomware\n\nAs shown above, the distribution of ransomware disguised as copyright-related claims has\nbeen continually done in the past. Because emails distributing such malware types may\ninclude names of actual illustrators, users may run attached files without realizing it. Hence\nthey should take extreme caution.\n\n[File Detection]\n\nMalware/Gen.Reputation.C4312359\n\n[Behavior Detection]\n\nMalware/MDP.SystemManipulation.M1751\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9.
