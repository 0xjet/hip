Nothing\ninteresting so far. The \"richard\" file is a shitty dropper, but the malware is just a bot that\npropagates itself using 61 different RCE exploits. I guess Richard is trying hard to get\n[popular ^^ pic.twitter.com/xA1Tn2o3z1](https://t.co/xA1Tn2o3z1)\n\n[— Carlos Brendel (@carbreal) August 6, 2019](https://twitter.com/carbreal/status/1158726557021757440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nBrendell says that he made the discovery after receiving weaponized code that targeted\n[security flaws in Asus devices. The list of payloads compiled by the researcher shows that](https://pastebin.com/heu5fnaR)\n[the operator relies on known exploits, some as old as 2010.](https://www.exploit-database.net/?id=12985)\n\nThe malware dropper is hosted on an open server, in a file called Richard.\n\nsource: [Carlos Brendel](https://twitter.com/carbrea)\nThe interesting part is that the author seems to have thrown in exploits without targeting a\nspecific category of products. The code incorporated is available from multiple public exploit\nrepositories.\n\nBrendel provided BleepingComputer with the exploits he found in this Echobot variant and\nthe products they target include an odd mix of hardware and software solutions: routers,\ncameras, smart home hubs, network-attached storage systems, servers, database\nmanagement software, Zeroshell distribution.\n\n\n-----\n\nsource: [Carlos Brendel](https://twitter.com/carbrea)\nIt should come as no surprise that this botnet includes such a high number of payloads. The\nmalware is one of the hundreds of spin-offs from Mirai botnet, whose code is publicly\navailable, built for distributed denial-of-service attacks. This enables anyone to modify it to\ntheir own liking.\n\nIt is unclear what the author of this variant is trying to achieve, but their endeavor definitely\nshows how easily one can pick up malicious code and adapt it to their own needs.\n\nList of exploits used by this Echobot variant.
