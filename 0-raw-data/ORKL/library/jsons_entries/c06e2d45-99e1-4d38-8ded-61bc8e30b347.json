According to the report, Cobalt is associated with the previously known\nBuhtrap[2] campaign. Buhtrap is thought to have stolen around USD 28.5 million from Russian\nbank accounts in 2015 and 2016. It is suspected that either part of that group switched over to\nCobalt, or that most of the Buhtrap creators redirected their efforts at ATMs.\n\nAt the same time, in the fall of 2016, Positive Technologies was independently investigating\nan incident at a bank in Eastern Europe. The bank had experienced phishing mailings as well\nas compromise of internal network resources and its ATM network. All the evidence indicated\nthat the attack was targeted. Artifacts indicated the involvement of the same organized crime\ngroup that, according to Positive Technologies information, from August to October had performed similar successful attacks in Eastern Europe, and it’s likely that this group may will soon\nbecome active in the West. Analysis confirmed that the Cobalt group was responsible.\n\nThis report includes the most important results of the investigation, including an example\nof a real-life advanced persistent threat (APT) attack that could occur at any bank. To implement the attack, the criminal group used easily available software to target some of the most\ncommon shortcomings and vulnerabilities in corporate systems, in which regard the financial\nsector is no exception (see the Positive Technologies report at www.ptsecurity.com/upload/\niblock/2fe/corporate_vulnerability_2016_eng.pdf.\n\nAccording to Group-IB, Buhtrap is the first criminal group to use a network worm to infect the\nentire infrastructure of a bank. The main vector for penetrating the bank’s corporate network\nconsisted of phishing messages, which claimed to be from the Bank of Russia or its representatives. Malware was planted in a number of attacks via exploits, notably including the\ninfrastructure of the Metel[3] group.\n\nA trend has been seen in 2016 towards the use of publicly available software, legitimate penetration testing software, and standard operating system (OS) functions by attackers. One instructive example is the 2016 attacks by the Carbanak[4] group in Eastern Europe. This group\nused similar tools, in addition to Metasploit. The same group is suspected in the recent hacking of PoS vendor Oracle MICROS[5] and attacks on international banks recently reported by\nSymantec[6].\n\nBy underestimating the abilities of cybercriminals, and assuming that attacks always happen\nto somebody else, companies fatally undermine their cybersecurity efforts. This can result in\nsubstantial financial losses.\n\nDespite the wealth of information now known about methods, tools used, and indicators of\ncompromise, the cybercriminals continue their attacks and are looking for new ways of monetizing their efforts. Targeted attacks on banks, retailers, and financial institutions around the\nworld are covered with increasing regularity in the media. Total losses related to such cybercrime, according to various estimates, run in the hundreds of millions of dollars. In 2017, we\nexpect to see an increase both in the number of attacks and in related financial losses by\nbanks—it would seem that the criminals are hitting their stride, while banks have barely even\nbegun to play catch-up.\n\n1 http://www.group-ib.com/cobalt.html\n2 http://www.group-ib.ru/brochures/gib-buhtrap-report.pdf\n3 http://www.group-ib.ru/brochures/Group-IB-Corkow-Report-EN.pdf\n4 http://www.group-ib.com/files/Anunak_APT_against_financial_institutions.pdf\n5 https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/08/data-breach-at-oracles-micros-point-of-sale-division\n6 https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/odinaff-new-trojan-used-high-level-financial-attacks\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2016\n\n\n#### Opening an ATM from the inside out\n\nIn early October 2016, Positive Technologies learned from a bank in Eastern Europe of a security incident that resulted in funds being stolen from bank ATMs.\n\nTotal funds stolen, in the course of one night from six ATMs, were the equivalent of approximately $35,000 in local currency. Rapid response by the bank and law enforcement prevented\nthe losses from growing. Theoretically, had the attackers continued for a longer period, they\ncould have stolen the equivalent of over $156,000 over several days, with the amount limited\nonly by the dispensing capabilities of the machines and number of compromised devices.\n\nIndividuals acting as cut-outs (“drops”) obtained cash from ATMs. One of these drops, a citizen of Moldova, was arrested by local law enforcement in the process of withdrawing money.\nThese drops are used by criminal groups to minimize the risk to core group members. Drops\ndo not know any of the core group members and work only with handlers, who are responsible for gathering the cash and delivering it to the organizers.\n\nCobalt uses so-called money mule services for laundering cash. These services attract the financially desperate with promises of easy earnings. Such services are plentiful online. Here are\nscreenshots of a few examples:\n\nThe investigation performed by the Positive Technologies team showed that the theft occurred due to a compromise of the bank’s local network and installation of malware on ATMs\nfrom the bank’s internal infrastructure in August–September 2016. The malware installed on\nthe ATMs was specialized, dispensing money from an ATM to a drop at the command of the\nattacker. Drops themselves did not need to perform any special manipulations of the ATM.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2016\n\n\n**Cobalt Strike as an attack**\n**tool**\n\nCobalt Strike functionality\nincludes:\n\n**++** Module for phishing attacks\n\n**++** Module for drive-by web\napp attacks\n\n**++** Module for establishing a\nbeachhead and spreading\non the network (Beacon)\n\n**++** Hidden communication\nmethods, including DNS\ntunneling and Peer-To-Peer\nSMB\n\n\n**More about Beacon:**\n\n**++** Written in PowerShell\n\n**++** Resides in RAM\n\n**++** Advanced remote\nmanagement capabilities\n(file downloading/\nuploading, privilege\nescalation, traffic proxy,\nkeylogger, network scanner)\n\n\n**Detected by antivirus**\n**software**\n\nAntivirus software on the\nbank servers detected the\ninfection. Rapid response\nby bank security personnel\ncould have prevented the\nincident. However, employees often turn off the\nantivirus protection on their\ncomputers and antivirus\nlogs were not checked at all.\n\n\n#### Can the trend be changed?\n\nAttacks on bank clients are starting to take a back seat to other methods that are every bit\nas effective—attacking the banks themselves, or more precisely, their network infrastructure.\nCriminals are aware that not all financial institutions make sufficient investments in their security and often concentrate on the bare minimum of compliance at the expense of actual\nsecurity. In addition, attacks on clients are limited to how much money the client has in their\naccount. But by taking over key servers and ATM controllers, hackers can strike a much more\nlucrative payday.\n\nThe last few years have seen a trend toward targeted attacks with social engineering and\nphishing messages. Most often, organizations (whether a bank, industrial concern, IT firm, or\nany other kind of company) concentrate on uptime in business processes, and when it comes\nto security, they buy and deploy various expensive solutions from outside vendors. But this\napproach has only middling results, closing a few of the most gaping holes in defense, while\nleaving untouched the weakest link in security: the human factor.\n\nAttack groups are constantly modernizing their techniques and identifying new vulnerabilities.\nBy staying at least one step ahead of defenders, attackers set the agenda for the entire security\nindustry.\n\nAs shown by the experience of Positive Technologies, attackers tend to use commonplace\ntools, such as software for legitimate pentesting and built-in OS functionality. Cobalt is merely\nthe most recent example of this trend.\n\nThis applies to the attack dissected in this report as well. Criminals used commercially available\nsoftware, Cobalt Strike[7], to perform penetration testing, including the use of the Beacon trojan.\nThe Beacon agent is the main payload and is classified as a RAT (Remote Access Trojan).\n\nWidely known legitimate Ammyy Admin software, downloadable from the manufacturer’s\nsite, was used for remote administration.\n\nOther common tools were used, including:\n\n**++** Mimikatz\n**++** PsExec\n**++** SoftPerfect Network Scanner\n**++** TeamViewer\n\nA Pass-the-Hash attack was used for moving about the target infrastructure: OS authentication\nwas bypassed by using a hash of the password, without even needing to know the password\nitself.\n\nIt should not be a surprise that criminals have switched to legitimate software for their attacks:\nmodern remote administration tools for network infrastructure and servers are so powerful\nthat there is simply no need to invent something else. And as a side benefit for attackers, identifying the use of such software is more difficult. The security of corporate infrastructure at\nmost banks is poor, leaving an opening that cybercriminals are sure to exploit.\n\n7 https://cobaltstrike.com\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2016\n\n\n**Subject lines of phishing**\n**messages (translated):**\n\n“Documents for signing”\n\n“Reconciliation for 04.08”\n\n“Balance reconciliation for\n04.08”\n\n“Yesterday’s meeting\nminutes”\n\n“Requirements for IT\nSecurity Staff”\n\n\n#### Attack timeline\n\nThe attack started in the first week of August. The initial infection vector started with a file\nnamed documents.exe; a RAR archive containing it was received in an email to a bank employee. If not for the employee being on vacation, the phishing message could have compromised\nthe bank’s entire infrastructure on that very same day. Instead, the attackers had to wait over\ntwo weeks for the workstation to be turned on again. As a consequence, the attackers had to\nrepeat their actions for developing the attack and elevating privileges in the OS.\n\nFor one month, emails were sent to various bank addresses, containing malware while claiming to be from employees of various banks. Analysis showed that the sender addresses were\nforged. But the addresses themselves are real and most of them can be found on the official\n[websites of the bank targeted, or online at curs.md/ru/lista_banci (a site dedicated to informa-](http://www.curs.md/ru/lista_banci)\ntion about Moldovan banks).\n\nThe mail server mail.peacedatamap.com was used to send the messages. Reply-to addresses\nwere hosted on the domain temp-mail.ru, a site for temporary email addresses. The reply-to\naddresses in messages received by bank employees were sesati@lackmail.ru and foyup@lackmail.ru.\n\nInvestigation showed that several employees opened the file from the phishing messages at\nmultiple times, indicating a poor level of security awareness at the organization.\n\nNotably, antivirus software detected both the original malicious attachments and the actions\nof the attackers after the compromise—long before money was actually stolen. Suspicious\nactivity by legitimate software (Ammyy Admin) was detected, and in some cases infection was\nprevented by the antivirus software. The original infection took place because the antivirus\nsoftware was disabled, or had out-of-date databases, on the workstation of the employee who\nran the malware from the phishing message.\n\nThe malware triggers the following verdicts by antivirus software:\n\n|ESET|SYMANTEC|KASPERSKY|\n|---|---|---|\n|Win32/Rozena|Trojan.Odinaff|RemoteAdmin.Win32.Ammyy|\n||Trojan.Odinaff!g1|Hacktool.Win32.Cobalt|\n||Trojan.Odinaff!gm|HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic|\n||Backdoor.Batel||\n||Remacc.Ammyy||\n||Backdoor.Gussdoor||\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2016\n\n\n**Spear phishing**\n## 1 (malicious attachments)\n\n\n**Penetration of local network**\n\nMessage from untrusted source opened,\nattachment run\n\n\n**Infection of workstation** **Foothold on local workstation**\n## 2\n\nExcessive user privileges\n\n\n**Network reconnaissance**\n## 3 and attack progression\n\n\n**Scanning of local network**\n\nEffective segmentation not present on network\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|L|AN||\n\n\n**Preparation for theft** **Compromise of key resources**\n## 4\n\nIdentification of employee computers that interface\nwith ATMs\n\n\n**Warnings for banks**\n\nAfter similar attacks in 2016,\nFinCERT issued several\nbulletins (ATM-OTH-MLJACKPOTTING-20160921-01,\nATM-OTH-MLJACKPOTTING-20161014-02\nand ВК-20160906-001) to\nalert banks to the risks and\nencourage them to take\npreventive measures (such\nas by looking for particular\nindicators of compromise on\nnetwork infrastructure).\n\n\n**Infection of ATMs** **Theft from ATMs**\n## 5\n\nDrops collect cash without performing any special\nactions at the ATM terminal\n\nTo reduce the likelihood of detection, attackers used various strategies:\n\n**++** Legitimate software and built-in OS functions were used.\n**++** Malware code was run only in RAM.\n**++** HTTPS was used for command and control.\n**++** A legitimate service, sendspace.com, was used for file exchange and download of the\noriginal malware.\n**++** Files were deleted, including with SDelete, to guarantee elimination of data.\n**++** Actions were performed primarily at night.\n\nAfter gaining a foothold on the bank infrastructure, the Cobalt team did not rush to act. Only\nat the end of August did they substantially develop the attack across the bank’s network. The\nattackers compromised the workstations of key employees and critical servers, including terminal server and domain controller. In addition, they stole the passwords of practically all company users, including administrator accounts, which allowed moving about the network at will.\n\nTo find and download various utilities (such as Mimikatz), Cobalt accessed legitimate sites and\nsearch engines directly from infected devices. Sites were chosen from the search results (for\nexample, github.com) and software was downloaded from those sites to workstations and\nservers. To download files, the malware used the publicly available site sendspace.com for file\nexchange. By using legitimate services, the attackers attempted to mask their actions.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2016\n\n\n**QA matters for criminals**\n**too**\n\nErrors in the malware prevented the criminals from\ntaking money from NCR\nATMs, although they tried to\n“troubleshoot” several times\nduring their attack.\n\n\nIt is important to note that using Mimikatz to get OS account credentials requires local administrator privileges. Key factors in the rapid spread of the attack across the network included the\nlack of network segmentation and overprivileged user accounts (the attacked user was a local\nadministrator on all workstations on the local network). Therefore, the attackers did not need\nto use any additional exploits to escalate their privileges or look for methods of penetrating\nanother network segment.\n\nAnother peak of activity occurred in early September, when the criminals actively attacked\nnetwork resources in order to identify the workstations of employees responsible for ATMs\nand bank cards. These attacks consisted, in essence, of remotely connecting to workstations,\nrunning Мimikatz to collect credentials, surveying the file system and installed software, and\nmoving on to the next workstation. After compromising the necessary devices, the attackers\nhad the information needed for initiating the theft itself.\n\nSecurity logs showed network movement by the attackers from compromised computers, including RAdmin sessions with ATMs. However, RAdmin is actively used by bank administrators\nto remotely access computers, including ATMs, and therefore this did not arouse suspicion.\n\nCobalt went about its plan with practically no special efforts to mask its activity – assuming\nthat its actions would not be noticed. But the attackers did not hurry to cash in right away.\nThey studied bank processes and waited for the maximum possible amount of cash to be\npresent in ATMs.\n\nThe attackers waited until early October to load malware on ATMs and steal money. They acted at night in order to minimize possible attention. The operator sent a command to ATMs and\nthe drops approached ATMs at a particular time and simply took all the money.\n\nDue to an error in the malware code, the attackers were unable to steal money from ATMs\nmanufactured by NCR. The malware generated errors in the ATM software. Despite attempts\nto fix this issue during the attack, including restarting the malware and ATMs multiple times\nover the course of two hours, the attackers were unsuccessful. In this case, luck helped the\nbank to curtail its losses.\n\nBased on the incident investigation, Positive Technologies experts collected a long list of hostand network-based indicators of compromise, which were sent to the FinCERT of the Bank of\nRussia in order to alert banks and prevent similar attacks in the future.\n\n#### Who says criminals don’t have a sense of humor\n\nDuring the investigation, Positive Technologies found a curious artifact: the email address used\nfor downloading Ammyy Admin combined a Russian-language obscenity with the name of\nKaspersky Lab.\n```\n 2016-09-**T17:22:35.489000+06:00,Page Visited,WEBHIST,Firefox History,http://www.\n ammyy.com/AA_v3.exe?em=huy%40kasperskyc.com (AA_v3.exe) [count: 0] Host: www.ammyy.\n com visited from: http://www.ammyy.com/ru/ (www.ammyy.com) (URL not typed directly)\n\n```\nTransition: DOWNLOAD,sqlite/firefox_history\n\nIn other words, Cobalt expected that Kaspersky Lab would be performing incident investigation. That assumption proved wrong, however, as shown by the work of the Positive\nTechnologies team.\n\n\n**C2 server addresses:**\n\n23.249.164.26\n149.56.115.70\n142.91.104.135\n173.254.204.67\n23.152.0.210\n185.82.202.232\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2016\n\n\n#### Technical aspects\n\nPositive Technologies experts analyzed the detected malware.

This means that at least one of the\ncriminals is a Russian speaker.

Banks must give serious thought to prevention in order\nto not become the next target.\n\nMore serious losses were avoided only thanks to the swift reaction of the bank, which brought\nin outside experts, and law enforcement, which caught one of the drops in the act of withdrawing money.\n\nThe criminals attempted to stay unnoticed on the bank network (hoping that use of legitimate\nsoftware would not raise suspicions), but antivirus software noticed malicious activity at the\nhost level. Thus proper security monitoring at the bank, had it been performed, could have\nprevented the incident entirely.\n\nTargeted attacks have become a fact of life in recent years. And when choosing their targets,\nattackers bypass the little fish—that is, individual clients—in favor of the big fish, the banks\nthemselves. Instead of elaborate zero-days, hackers use the most common vulnerabilities to\ntarget the weakest link in bank systems. APT attacks are not necessarily as complicated as\nthey may seem. Banks need to make securing their infrastructure a priority, not just another\ncheckbox to be completed at audit time. When the next attack occurs, will it be your bank that\nis targeted?\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2016\n\n\nAbout Positive Technologies\n\nPositive Technologies is a leading global provider of enterprise security solutions for vulnerability and\ncompliance management, incident and threat analysis, and application protection.
