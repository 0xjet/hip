It is unclear if this marks their ransomware gang's\nreturn or the servers being turned on by law enforcement.\n\nOn July 2nd, the REvil ransomware gang, aka Sodinokibi, used a zero-day vulnerability in\nthe Kaseya VSA remote management software to encrypt approximately 60 managed\nservice providers (MSPs) and over 1,500 of their business customers.\n\nREvil then demanded $5 million from MSPs for a decryptor or $44,999 for each encrypted\nextension at the individual businesses.\n\n[The gang also demanded $70 million for a master decryption key to decrypt all Kaseya](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-asks-70-million-to-decrypt-all-kaseya-attack-victims/)\nvictims but soon dropped the price to $50 million.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the attack, the ransomware gang faced increasing pressure from law enforcement and\nthe White House, who warned that the USA would take action themselves if Russia did not\nact upon threat actors in their borders.\n\nSoon after, the [REvil ransomware gang disappeared, and all of their Tor servers and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-gangs-web-sites-mysteriously-shut-down/)\ninfrastructure were shut down.\n\nTo this day, it is not clear what happened, but it left ransomware victims who wished to\nnegotiate unable to do so and without the ability to restore files.\n\nMysteriously, [Kaseya later received the master decryption key for the attack victims and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kaseya-obtains-universal-decryptor-for-revil-ransomware-victims/)\nstated it was from a trusted third party. It is believed that Russian intelligence received the\ndecryption key from the threat actors and passed it along to the FBI as a gesture of\ngoodwill.\n\n## REvil infrastructure suddenly turns back on\n\nToday, both the Tor payment/negotiation site and REvil's Tor 'Happy Blog' data leak site\nsuddenly came back online.\n\nThe most current victim on the REvil data leak site was added on July 8th, 2021, just five\ndays before REvil's mysterious disappearance.\n\n\n-----\n\n**REvil's Happy Blog data leak site**\nUnlike the data leak site, which is functional, the Tor negotiation site does not appear to be\nfully operational yet. While it shows the login screen, as seen below, it does not allow\nvictims to log into the site.\n\n\n-----\n\n**REvil Tor negotiation site**\nThe gang's http://decoder.re/ is still offline at this time.\n\nIt is unclear at this time whether the ransomware gang is back in operation, the servers\nhave been turned back on by mistake, or it is due to the actions of law enforcement.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n[REvil ransomware returns: New malware sample confirms gang is back](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-returns-new-malware-sample-confirms-gang-is-back/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[REvil s TOR sites come alive to redirect to new ransomware operation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revils-tor-sites-come-alive-to-redirect-to-new-ransomware-operation/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Data Leak](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-leak/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[REvil](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/revil/)\n[Tor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/tor/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
