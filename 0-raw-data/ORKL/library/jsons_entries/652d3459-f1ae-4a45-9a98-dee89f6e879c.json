AT&T Cybersecurity](https://cybersecurity.att.com/)\n[2. Blog](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs)\n\nJuly 6, 2021 | [Fernando Martinez](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/author/fmartinez)\n\n## Executive summary\n\nAT&T Alien Labs™ has observed new activity that has been attributed to the Lazarus adversary group\npotentially targeting engineering job candidates and/or employees in classified engineering roles within the\nU.S. and Europe. This assessment is based on malicious documents believed to have been delivered by\nLazarus during the last few months (spring 2021). However, historical analysis shows the lures used in this\ncampaign to be in line with others used to target these groups.\n\nThe purpose of this blog is to share the new technical intelligence and provide detection options for\ndefenders. Alien Labs will continue to report on any noteworthy changes.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nLazarus has been identified targeting defense contractors with malicious documents.\nThere is a high emphasis on renaming system utilities (Certutil and Explorer) to obfuscate the\n[adversary’s activities (T1036.003).](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/003/)\n\n## Background\n\n\n-----\n\nSince 2009, the known tools and capabilities believed to have been used by the Lazarus Group include\nDDoS botnets, keyloggers, remote access tools (RATs), and drive wiper malware. The most publicly\ndocumented malware and tools used by the group actors include Destover, Duuzer, and Hangman.\n\n## Analysis\n\nSeveral documents identified from May to June 2021 by Twitter users were identified as being linked to the\nLazarus group. Documents observed in previous campaigns lured victims with job opportunities for Boeing\nand BAE systems. These new documents include:\n\n_Rheinmetall_job_requirements.doc: identified by_ [ESET Research.](https://twitter.com/esetresearch/status/1389904254811394049)\n_[General_motors_cars.doc: identified by Twitter user @1nternaut.](https://twitter.com/1nternaut/status/1394050982632468481)_\n_Airbus_job_opportunity_confidential.doc: identified by_ [360CoreSec.](https://twitter.com/360CoreSec/status/1402920149754155010)\n\nThe documents attempted to impersonate new defense contractors and engineering companies like Airbus,\nGeneral Motors (GM), and Rheinmetall. All of these documents contain macro malware, which has been\ndeveloped and improved during the course of this campaign and from one target to another. The core\ntechniques for the three malicious documents are the same, but the attackers attempted to reduce the\npotential detections and increase the faculties of the macros.\n\n## First iteration: Rheinmetall\n\nThe first two documents from early May 2021 were related to a German Engineering company focused on\nthe defense and automotive industries, Rheinmetall. The second malicious document appears to include\nmore elaborate content, which may have resulted in the documents going unnoticed by victims.\n\nThe Macro has base64 encoded files, which are extracted and decoded during execution. Some of the files\nare split inside the Macro and are not combined until the time of decoding. One of the most distinctive\ncharacteristics of this Macro is how it evades detections of a MZ header encoded in base64 (TVoA, TVpB,\nTVpQ, TVqA, TVqQ or TVro), by separating the first two characters from the rest of the content, as seen in\nFigure 1.\n\nFigure 1: Concealing of MZ header, as captured by Alien Labs.\n\nThe rest of the content is kept together in lines of 64 characters, and because of this, YARA rules can be\nused to detect other, typical executable content encoded in base64 aside of the MZ header. In this case, up\nto nine different YARA rules alerted to suspicious encoded strings in our Alien Labs analysis, like\nVirtualProtect GetProcAddress IsDebuggerPresent GetCurrentProcessId etc\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: YARA rules detections listed in the AT&T Alien Labs Open Threat Exchange, OTX.\n\nAll files created by the executable and used by the different Macros are located in a new folder C:/Drivers\nwith the purpose of masquerading their activity. The Macro copies and renames the Microsoft legitimate\nexecutable Certutil.exe into this folder. The reason for this copy is to avoid endpoint detection and response\n(EDR) signatures based on system utilities executed from non-standard sources (a Microsoft Office\ndocument in this case). Additionally, the copy of Certutil is disguised to avoid using the full string, by\npartially replacing it with an asterisk %systemroot%\\system32\\certut*.exe. As seen in later iterations, this\ntechnique was slightly modified to further reduce the number of detections.\n\nCertutil is used to decode the previously mentioned file, doing it within the same folder and with a different\nexecutable name. Once the necessary files have been decoded, the encoded files are removed from the\nsystem.\n\nThe script queries WMI to list all the explorer.exe processes, where it will try to inject the malicious payload.\nFor the injection, the attackers used Mavinject (a legitimate Windows component that can be used and\nabused) to perform arbitrary code injections inside any running process. Mavinject.exe has been abused for\n[several years, as indicated in this blog from 2017.](https://reaqta.com/2017/12/mavinject-microsoft-injector/)\n\nFigure 3: Mavinject injection to explorer, as captured by Alien Labs.\n\nFigure 4: Malicious Document execution tree listed in the AT&T Alien Labs OTX.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payload is in fact a downloader, which requests the next stage to a hardcoded Command and Control\n(C&C) server and saves it to a new file. This request is made through HTTPS with hardcoded headers. In\nthis case, the domain used as C&C has been registered for several years, and the domain continues to\nhave a long expiration date. For these reasons, this domain was assessed as a compromised domain,\nleveraged by Lazarus as C&C.\n\nFigure 5: Hardcoded HTTP headers, as captured by Alien Labs.\n\n## Second iteration: General Motors\n\nA few weeks after the Rheinmetall document was observed, a very similar document emerged targeting\nGeneral Motors. The characteristics of this document were very similar to the previous one, but with minor\nupdates in the C&C communication process.\n\nAfter attempting to execute all its code, the Macro reports back to the C&C server with the status of the\ninfection. In the code, a variable is updated from 1 to 3, signaling the status of the execution. The C&C is\ncapable of tracking where its execution is failing, or encountering unexpected behavior, based on the\nrequests made to the different documents in the C&C. This includes:\n\n1. During copying, decoding, renaming and executing the payload\n2. After successfully executing the payload\n3. After (and if) the payload was able to contact the C&C and download a file which is saved in the\n\nC:\\Drivers folder with the inf extension.\n\nThe status report to the C&C also requests the lure document, which at this moment is downloaded from\nthe same C&C and opened.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: C&C beacon to report execution status, as captured by Alien Labs.\n\nThe domain used in this document and payload allgraphicart[.]com is no longer a compromised domain. It\nwas first registered on April 1, 2021. However, it did not have any noteworthy activity until these malicious\ndocuments showed up, at least a month after the domain was registered. The domain was registered with\nPorkbun LLC, who offers domains with the free option of protecting the whois information.\n\n## Third iteration: Airbus\n\nIn early June, a month after the first document of this campaign was observed, a new document was\nidentified targeting Airbus. This time, the C&C communications were very similar to the previous iteration of\nthe document; however, the execution and injection processes were different.\n\nThis document continues utilizing and masquerading Certutil, but the copy command had the minor addition\nof another asterisk to reduce the detection risk: %systemroot%\\system32\\*ertut*.exe. In addition to Certutil,\nthe legitimate explorer executable is copied to the C:\\Drivers folder through a similar method\n_%systemroot%\\exp*.exe. As previously mentioned, these files will be copied and renamed to avoid EDR_\nsignature-based detections, but this time the destination filenames were carefully chosen. If alphabetically\nordered, the first two files will correspond to legitimate software, followed by the malicious files, which could\nmislead investigators on their first peak on the C:\\Drivers folder.\n\nThis Macro contains three files encoded with base64 which are copied to disk and decoded during\nexecution:\n\nThe first .tmp file will become a .lnk file after decoding. This lnk file is executed with Explorer and\nperforms the next decoding.\nThe second tmp file is concatenated (linked) with a third one, from the next-stage payload after\ndecoding.\n\nAfter the actions, the Macro executes the mentioned payload with an updated technique. The attackers are\nno longer using Mavinject, but directly executing the payload with explorer.exe, significantly modifying the\nresulting execution tree as seen in Figure 10. Once the payload has been executed, the Macro waits for\nthree seconds before creating of an .inf file in the same folder. Whether it was successfully executed or not,\n\n\n-----\n\nthe Macro will proceed to send the beacon to the C&C with the execution status and delete all the\ntemporary files, attempting to clean their tracks. The only files left in C:\\Drivers\\ at this point are the payload\nand the .inf file.\n\nFigure 7: Malicious Document execution tree, as captured by AT&T Alien Labs.\n\nThe new C&C shopweblive[.]com follows the same pattern and characteristics of the one used in the\nsecond iteration.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe reported activity remains in line with the Lazarus’ past campaigns and is not expected to be the last.\nAttack lures, potentially targeting engineering professionals in government organizations, showcase the\nimportance of tracking Lazarus and their evolution. We continue to see Lazarus using the same tactic,\ntechniques, and procedures that we have observed in the past, such as using Microsoft Office documents\nthat download remote templates, Microsoft Office Macros, and compromised third party infrastructure to\nhost the payloads and proxy C&C traffic through. AT&T Alien Labs will continue to monitor and report on\nany noteworthy changes.\n\n## Detection Methods\n\nThe following associated detection methods are in use by Alien Labs. They can be used by readers to tune\nor deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.\n\nSURICATA IDS SIGNATURES\n\n2033135: ET TROJAN Observed Lazarus Maldoc CnC Domain (shopweblive .com in TLS SNI)\n\nTDR / MTDR CORRELATION RULES\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious activity detected after Certutil.exe file decoding\n\nWindows renamed binary\n\nSuspicious Process Created by Microsoft Office Application\n\nWindows MavInject DLL Injection\n\nYARA RULES\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule LazarusCampaign_MacroDoc_Jun2021 : WindowsMalware {\n  meta:\n   author = \"AlienLabs\"\n   description = \"Detects Lazarus campaign macro document Jun2021.\"\n   reference =\n\"https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/294acafed42c6a4f546486636b4859c074e53d74be049df99932804be048f42\nc\"\n   SHA256 = \"294acafed42c6a4f546486636b4859c074e53d74be049df99932804be048f42c\"\n  strings:\n   $a1 = \"ZSBydW4gaW4gRE9TIG1vZGUuDQ0KJA\" ascii //run in DOS mode. - base64 encoded\n   $a2 = \"c:\\\\Drivers\"\n   $a3 = \"AAAAAAAAAA=\" ascii // base64 content\n   $a4 = \"CreateObject(\\\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\\\").CreateTextFile\"\n   $a5 = \"cmd /c copy\"\n   $a6 = {73 79 73 74 65 6d 33 32 5c 2a 65 72 74 75 74 2a 2e 65 78 65} // system32\\*ertut*.exe\n   $a7 = {25 73 79 73 74 65 6d 72 6f 6f 74 25 5c 65 78 70 2a 2e 65 78 65} //\n%systemroot%\\exp*.exe\n   $a8 = \"sleep 1000\"\n   $a9 = \"cmd /c explorer.exe /root\"\n   $a10 = \"-decode \"\n   $b = \"tAnNIbgBTM0hVGhpcyBwcm9ncmFtIGNhbm5v\" ascii //This program cannot - base64 encoded\n  condition:\n   uint16(0) == 0xCFD0 and\n    filesize < 2000KB and\n    $b and\n    5 of ($a*)\n}\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n rule LazarusCampaign_Payload_Jun2021 : WindowsMalware {\n  meta:\n    author = \"AlienLabs\"\n    description = \"Detects Lazarus campaign downloader Jun2021.\"\n    reference =\n \"https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/294acafed42c6a4f546486636b4859c074e53d74be049df99932804be048f42\n c\"\n    SHA256 = \"f5563f0e63d9deed90b683a15ebd2a1fda6b72987742afb40a1202ddb9e867d0\"\n  strings:\n    $a1 = \"Office ClickToRun\" wide ascii\n    $a2 = \"C:\\\\Drivers\\\\\"\n   condition:\n    uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and all of them\n }\n\n## Associated indicators (IOCs)\n\n```\nThe following technical indicators are associated with the reported intelligence.
