Instead, it appears it was designed as a wiper pretending to be](https://securelist.com/destructive-malware-five-wipers-in-the-spotlight/58194/)\nransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow the technical details are presented. First, in order to decrypt victim s disk the attackers\nneed the installation ID:\n\nIn previous versions of “similar” ransomware like Petya/Mischa/GoldenEye, this installation\nID contains crucial information for the key recovery. After sending this information to the\nattacker they can extract the decryption key using their private key.\n\nHere’s how this installation ID is generated in the ExPetr ransomware:\n\nThis installation ID in our test case is built using the CryptGenRandom function, which is\nbasically generating random data.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following buffer contains the randomly generated data in an encoded “BASE58” format:\n\nIf we compare this randomly generated data and the final installation ID shown in the first\nscreen, they are the same. In a normal setup, this string should contain encrypted\ninformation that will be used to restore the decryption key. For ExPetr, the ID shown in the\n**ransom screen is just plain random data.**\n\nThat means that the attacker cannot extract any decryption information from such a\nrandomly generated string displayed on the victim, and as a result, the victims will not be\nable to decrypt any of the encrypted disks using the installation ID.\n\nWhat does it mean? Well, first of all, this is the worst-case news for the victims – even if they\npay the ransom they will not get their data back. Secondly, this reinforces the theory that the\nmain goal of the ExPetr attack was not financially motivated, but destructive.\n\nOur friend Matt Suiche from Comae Technologies independently came to the same\nconclusion.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Data Encryption](https://securelist.com/tag/data-encryption/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Petya](https://securelist.com/tag/petya/)\n[Ransomware](https://securelist.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Wiper](https://securelist.com/tag/wiper/)\n\nAuthors\n\nAnton Ivanov\n\n[Orkhan Mamedov](https://securelist.com/author/orkhanmamedov/)\n\nExPetr/Petya/NotPetya is a Wiper, Not Ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nYour email address will not be published.

In this report we describe how the MoonBounce\nimplant works and how it is connected to APT41.\n\n## The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on\n\nIt appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to\nsolely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.\n\nSubscribe to our weekly e-mails\n\nThe hottest research right in your inbox\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
