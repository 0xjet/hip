Read More...](https://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/author/josip-mili%C4%87)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe concept of devices with a specific purpose, interconnected over the Internet, was\nintroduced in the 1980’s when a beverage vending machine reported its inventory and\ntemperature (i.e. data on whether the stored drinks were cold) back to a central server. This\nwas not set up by the machine distributor, but university engineers who were fed up with the\nfact that they would walk great distances to the vending machine and find it empty, or even\nworse, filled with warm drinks. Their idea was simple- provide useful information, wirelessly\nand automatically.\n\nThis concept has evolved into what we call the 'Internet of Things (IoT).' And while this term\nhas been with us for over two decades, it took years of computer hardware and software\ndevelopment, especially in the fields of network connectivity and infrastructure, for IoT to\nbecome commercially viable and accessible to the mass population. All kinds of monitoring,\nautomation, and accessory devices, ranging from Internet routers, web-based cameras, and\nremote monitoring sensors, became cheaper and more readily available. It's not a big\nsurprise that since the beginning of the current decade, the number of IoT devices has grown\nand continues to grow exponentially. Current estimates of IoT devices per person worldwide\nis around 3.5, and this is projected to grow to 9.4 in 2025 - that is a lot of devices with access\nto the Internet!\n\nThroughout our digital history lots of regular computer and server vulnerabilities have been\nexposed, and unfortunately these unpatched systems have been exploited by attackers.\nSubsequently, hardware and software manufacturers have taken action to minimize attack\npoints, and their customers have invested in additional third-party security solutions in efforts\nto mitigate their risks from attack. And while security has gained more attention, there has\nalso been increasing interest in finding new security holes to leverage in malicious activities\nas well. Attackers are innovating as fast as security providers innovate. Knowledge taken\nfrom this never-ending battle has helped create better security standards and practices\n\n\n-----\n\nhowever IoT manufactures and their devices are still catching up to them. It doesn t help that\nsome IoT manufacturers rush to bring their products to market for competitive advantage,\noften overlooking fundamental security in the process. This makes them potentially exposed\nto different kinds of attacks, including those which were already seen and studied, thus\npotentially avoidable.\n\n**Introducing Mirai**\n\nWith growing interest in the potential of IoT and connected things, attackers have found\nopportunities to exploit these devices. New malware and botnets (i.e. a network of\ninterconnected devices or robots which are controlled by an attacker through a Command\nand Control (C&C) server) are being specifically built to target IoT devices. BASHLITE was\none such early malware used to infect IoT devices.\n\nAnother malicious software is known as Mirai. Mirai is perhaps the most famous IoT botnet\nused to create distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks with record breaking traffic peaks\n(reported up to 1 Tbits). In September 2016 Mirai was used to create huge botnets which\nsimultaneously attacked high profile web sites and service providers, for example:\n\n[Potent IoT DDoS Attack Leverages Published Source Code](https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/10/brace-yourselves-source-code-powering-potent-iot-ddoses-just-went-public/)\n\n1 Tbits DDoS attack hits OVH (French web hosting provider)\n[DDoS Attack Uses Mirai](https://dyn.com/blog/dyn-analysis-summary-of-friday-october-21-attack/)\n\nUndisclosed traffic peak DDoS attack hits Dyn (DNS service provider)\n[Cyber Criminals Get Jail](https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/mirai/)\n\n620 Gbits DDoS attack reported by the owner\n\nThese events made headlines even on non-security focused websites, and (re)raised\nquestions about security of IoT devices, particularly since most of the infected IoT devices\nwere consumer-centric home security systems. The most concerning part of the story was\nthat Mirai didn’t use something special to infect the IoT devices - it used a simple brute force\ntechnique with a predetermined list of default credentials for various IoT devices. TCP SYN\nprobes had been sent to random IPv4 addresses (except private networks and certain\nsubnets) on Telnet TCP ports 23 and 2323. In case of a response from pinged devices it\nwould try to login using the default credentials and if successful, reported the credentials to a\nC&C server. A scanning file would then be downloaded from the server to find out the\nunderlying architecture and finally - the appropriate Mirai malware would be executed and\nthen wait for attack commands from the server. There is also an interesting fact that any\nother found malware was removed. The infected devices still worked as intended, with some\noccasional resource issues making them appear slow, so its users couldn't detect that there\nwas something wrong with their devices.\n\nOnce the targets had been chosen, they received attack commands from the C&C server\nand started the DDoS attacks which were difficult to mitigate since they came from devices\nwith many different IP addresses. There are reports that the number of devices infected by\nMirai peaked at 600,000! A simple solution was to reboot the infected IoT device and change\n\n\n-----\n\nthe login credentials, but as noted, most users were unaware of the issue, and many vendors\ndon’t bother to patch the devices to make them more secure, or often didn’t have the\nresources or capabilities to update.\n\nShortly after the attacks (end of September 2016), the source code of Mirai malware was put\nonline making it available for anyone to use the malware or create new variants (Figure 1).\nThere are reports of new variants which have emerged such as Okiru, Masuta, PureMasuta,\nSatori, OMG and Wicked. They are designed to use various other attack methods, so the\nmalware has advanced beyond just DDoS attacks.\n\n**Figure 1: Recorded Future chart illustrating rise of Mirai and variants**\n\nAdditional Mirai research is highlighted in the 1H 2019 NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence\nReport\n\nUsing ReversingLabs malware analysis repository, which includes insights into over 1.5\nbillion files, we can track the number of Mirai samples observed and collected from the wild\nfor the first time. Figure 2 shows the increasing trend in the number of Mirai samples\ncollected over time, with an approximate 2x increase in the 2nd half of 2018. Of all the 218K\ndifferent Mirai files the repository contains, half of them (110K) were first seen since the\nbeginning of the current year (2019).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Number of Mirai files first seen by ReversingLabs**\n\nMost of the Mirai files first seen in the current year have ELF as their identified file type,\nwhich is expected since Mirai targets Linux embedded systems (Figure 3). There are some\nText files (mostly shell scripts) and interestingly one image file (a JPEG) which is used as a\ndownloader.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3: Mirai File count by File Type**\n\nIn taking a closer look at this JPEG image file in the downloader using the A1000, the\nmalware analysis and investigation component to ReversingLabs Titanium Platform (Figure\n4), we can see that it contains 180 files embedded inside of it, and 18 of them have a\nmalicious classification.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: ReversingLabs A1000 Console**\n\nThe Mirai botnet continues to reign as the king of IoT malware. And its proliferation through\ncybercriminal and hacker code sharing, increasing efficiencies across the dark web\necosystem, and innovations in payload obfuscation and delivery continue to make Mirai a\npotent threat. On a positive note, the community is seeing more arrests of botnet operators,\nas well as new regulations on IoT device security that will drive manufacturers to factor\nsecurity into their products.\n\n\n-----\n\n## MORE BLOG ARTICLES\n\n\n-----",
