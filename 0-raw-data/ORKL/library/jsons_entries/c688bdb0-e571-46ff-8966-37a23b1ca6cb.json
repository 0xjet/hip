    "plain_text": "**December 01, 2015 | By FireEye Threat Intelligence | Threat Intelligence, Threat Research**\n\n**FireEye Threat Intelligence analysts identified a spear phishing campaign carried out in August 2015 targeting**\n**Hong Kong-based media organizations. A China-based cyber threat group, which FireEye tracks as an**\n**uncategorized advanced persistent threat (APT) group and other researchers refer to as “admin@338,” may**\n**have conduced the activity.[1] The email messages contained malicious documents with a malware payload**\n**called LOWBALL. LOWBALL abuses the Dropbox cloud storage service for command and control (CnC). We**\n**collaborated with Dropbox to investigate the threat, and our cooperation revealed what may be a second,**\n**similar operation. The attack is part of a trend where threat groups hide malicious activity by communicating**\n**with legitimate web services such as social networking and cloud storage sites to foil detection efforts.[2][3]**\n\n**The threat group has previously used newsworthy events as lures to deliver malware. [4] They have largely**\n**targeted organizations involved in financial, economic and trade policy, typically using publicly available RATs**\n**such as Poison Ivy, as well some non-public backdoors.[5]**\n\n**The group started targeting Hong Kong media companies, probably in response to political and economic**\n**challenges in Hong Kong and China. The threat group’s latest activity coincided with the announcement of**\n**criminal charges against democracy activists.[6] During the past 12 months, Chinese authorities have faced**\n**several challenges, including large-scale protests in Hong Kong in late 2014, the precipitous decline in the**\n**stock market in mid-2015, and the massive industrial explosion in Tianjin in August 2015. In Hong Kong, the**\n**pro-democracy movement persists, and the government recently denied a professor a post because of his**\n**links to a pro-democracy leader.[7]**\n\n**Multiple China-based cyber threat groups have targeted international media organizations in the past. The**\n**targeting has often focused on Hong Kong-based media, particularly those that publish pro-democracy**\n**material. The media organizations targeted with the threat group’s well-crafted Chinese language lure**\n**documents are precisely those whose networks Beijing would seek to monitor. Cyber threat groups’ access to**\n**the media organization’s networks could potentially provide the government advance warning on upcoming**\n**protests, information on pro-democracy group leaders, and insights needed to disrupt activity on the Internet,**\n**such as what occurred in mid-2014 when several websites were brought down in denial of service attacks.[8]**\n\n**In August 2015, the threat actors sent spear phishing emails to a number of Hong Kong-based media**\n**organizations, including newspapers, radio, and television. The first email references the creation of a**\n**Christian civil society organization to coincide with the anniversary of the 2014 protests in Hong Kong known**\n**as the Umbrella Movement. The second email references a Hong Kong University alumni organization that**\n**fears votes in a referendum to appoint a Vice Chancellor will be co opted by pro Beijing interests [9]**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: Lure Screenshots**\n\n**The group’s previous activities against financial and policy organizations have largely focused on spear**\n**phishing emails written in English, destined for Western audiences. This campaign, however, is clearly**\n**designed for those who read the traditional Chinese script commonly used in Hong Kong.**\n\n**The spear phishing emails contained three attachments in total, each of which exploited an older vulnerability**\n**in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158):**\n\n**MD5** **Filename**\n\n**b9208a5b0504cb2283b1144fc455eaaa** **使命[公⺠運動]** **我們[的異象].doc**\n\n**ec19ed7cddf92984906325da59f75351** **新聞[稿及公佈].doc**\n\n**(代發)[采訪[通知]]港⼤[校友關注組遞]**\n**6495b384748188188d09e9d5a0c401a4**\n\n**信⾏[動].doc**\n\n**In all three cases, the payload was the same:**\n\n|MD5|Filename|\n|---|---|\n|b9208a5b0504cb2283b1144fc455eaaa|使命公⺠運動 我們的異象 .doc|\n|ec19ed7cddf92984906325da59f75351|新聞稿及公佈 .doc|\n|6495b384748188188d09e9d5a0c401a4|(代發)[采訪通知]港⼤校友關注組遞 信⾏動.doc|\n\n|MD5|Filename|\n|---|---|\n|d76261ba3b624933a6ebb5dd73758db4|time.exe|\n\n\n-----\n\n**ability to download, upload, and execute files.

However, this is most likely meant to be a mechanism to**\n**update the compromised host with a new version of the LOWBALL malware.**\n\n**The threat group monitors its Dropbox account for responses from compromised computers. Once the**\n**LOWBALL malware calls back to the Dropbox account, the attackers will create a file called**\n**“[COMPUTER_NAME]_upload.bat” which contains commands to be executed on the compromised computer.**\n**This batch file is then executed on the target computer, with the results uploaded to the attackers’ Dropbox**\n**account in a file named “[COMPUTER_NAME]_download”.**\n\n**We observed the threat group issue the following commands:**\n\n**@echo off**\n\n**dir c:\\ >> %temp%\\download**\n\n**ipconfig /all >> %temp%\\download**\n\n**net user >> %temp%\\download**\n\n**net user /domain >> %temp%\\download**\n\n**ver >> %temp%\\download**\n\n**del %0**\n\n**@echo off**\n\n**dir \"c:\\Documents and Settings\" >> %temp%\\download**\n\n**dir \"c:\\Program Files\\**\n\n**\" >> %temp%\\download**\n\n|MD5|Filename|\n|---|---|\n|d76261ba3b624933a6ebb5dd73758db4|WmiApCom|\n|79b68cdd0044edd4fbf8067b22878644|WmiApCom.bat|\n\n\n-----\n\n**net localgroup administrator >> %temp%\\download**\n\n**netstat -ano >> %temp%\\download**\n\n**These commands allow the threat group to gain information about the compromised computer and the**\n**network to which it belongs. Using this information, they can decide to explore further or instruct the**\n**compromised computer to download additional malware.**\n\n**We observed the threat group upload a second stage malware, known as BUBBLEWRAP (also known as**\n**Backdoor.APT.FakeWinHTTPHelper) to their Dropbox account along with the following command:**\n\n**@echo off**\n\n**ren \"%temp%\\upload\" audiodg.exe**\n\n**start %temp%\\audiodg.exe**\n\n**dir d:\\ >> %temp%\\download**\n\n**systeminfo >> %temp%\\download**\n\n**del %0**\n\n**We have previously observed the admin@338 group use BUBBLEWRAP. This particular sample connected to**\n**the CnC domain accounts.serveftp[.]com, which resolved to an IP address previously used by the threat**\n**group, although the IP had not been used for some time prior to this most recent activity:**\n\n**MD5**\n\n**0beb957923df2c885d29a9c1743dd94b** **accounts.serveftp.com** **59.188.0.197**\n\n**BUBBLEWRAP is a full-featured backdoor that is set to run when the system boots, and can communicate**\n**using HTTP, HTTPS, or a SOCKS proxy. This backdoor collects system information, including the operating**\n**system version and hostname, and includes functionality to check, upload, and register plugins that can**\n**further enhance its capabilities.**\n\n**FireEye works closely with security researchers and industry partners to mitigate cyber threats, and we**\n**collaborated with Dropbox to respond to this activity. The Dropbox security team was able to identify this**\n**abuse and put countermeasures in place.**\n\n**Our cooperation uncovered what appears to be a second, ongoing operation, though we lack sufficient**\n**evidence to verify if admin@338 is behind it. The attack lifecycle followed the same pattern, though some of**\n**th** **fil** **diff** **t** **hi h i di** **t** **th t th** **b** **lti l** **i** **f th** **l** **I** **dditi**\n\n|MD5|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|0beb957923df2c885d29a9c1743dd94b|accounts.serveftp.com|59.188.0.197|\n\n\n-----\n\n**duration, we suspect this second operation involves up to 50 targets. At this time, we are unable to identify the**\n**victims.**\n\n**In this case, after the payload is delivered via an exploit the threat actor places files (named upload.bat,**\n**upload.rar, and period.txt, download.txt or silent.txt) in a directory on a Dropbox account. The malware**\n**beacons to this directory using the hardcoded API token and attempts to download these files (which are**\n**deleted from the Dropbox account after the download):**\n\n**upload.bat, a batch script that the compromised machine will execute**\n**upload.rar, a RAR archive that contains at least two files: a batch script to execute, and often an**\n**executable (sometimes named rar.exe) which the batch script will run and almost always uploads the**\n**results of download.rar to the cloud storage account**\n**silent.txt and period.txt, small files sizes of 0-4 bytes that dictate the frequency to check in with the CnC**\n\n**The threat actor will then download the results and then delete the files from the cloud storage account.**\n\n**LOWBALL is an example of malware that abuses cloud storage services to mask its activity from network**\n**defenders. The LOWBALL first stage malware allows the group to collect information from victims and then**\n**deliver the BUBBLEWRAP second stage malware to their victims after verifying that they are indeed**\n**interesting targets.**\n\n**_A version of this article appeared first on the_** **_FireEye Intelligence Center.
