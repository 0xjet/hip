The current pandemic is\nno exception. Unit 42 has previously reported on how cybercriminals have preyed on consumers during\nCOVID-19 and on the use of COVID-19 themed phishing attacks impersonating brands like Pfizer and\nBioNTech. This article provides early warnings for the travel industry and global travelers by sharing\ninformation about various attack attempts targeting the travel industry.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, when people all over the world scrambled to get protective supplies\n– personal protective equipment, sanitizer and toilet paper – threat actors tried to take advantage of\nsupply issues by selling fake products. They also tried to trick people by purporting to be credible\n\n\n-----\n\nhealth organizations (such as the WHO) or pharmaceutical companies, all while the actual\norganizations and companies were trying to make sense of the virus and come up with metrics,\nprotective measures and vaccines.\n\nAlthough the pandemic is not over, as the world opens up borders and the vaccines slow down the\nspread of the virus, people who have been cooped up at home are eager to travel. Threat actors are\ntaking advantage of this trend by using travel as a theme for phishing people and stealing data –\naccount credentials, financial information and so on – subsequently selling this data in underground\nmarkets.\n\nHere, we first show that there has been a substantial increase in the registration of travel-related\nphishing URLs in 2021. Second, we provide two real-life examples demonstrating attackers abusing\nthe travel theme, including the Dridex malware distribution and the abuse of Firebase in phishing\ncampaigns. Third, we talk about how threat actors use various data that they steal. Finally, we\nconclude with a discussion of best practices for both individuals and organizations.\n\n[Please note that Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall customers are protected from phishing](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall)\n[attacks with various security services, including Advanced URL Filtering and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-url-filtering) [WildFire.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire)\n\n## Increase in Travel-themed Phishing\n\nTo conduct social engineering, threat actors have always leveraged malicious domains and URLs\nimpersonating known brands and websites familiar to end users. The content served on these\nmalicious domains or URLs is crafted to mislead end users, since they look and feel very similar to\nbrands that users know.\n\nAlternatively, threat actors also send phishing emails to end users to trick them into either downloading\nmalicious attachments or clicking on links that lead to malicious content – website pages or\nattachments. Threat actors use themes that invoke a sense of urgency (such as outstanding invoices)\nor appeal to the end user emotionally (such as travel-themed emails sent as the world opens up).\n\n### Increase in the Number of Travel-themed Phishing URLs\n\nUnit 42 analyzed travel-themed phishing URLs created between October 2019 and August 2021. As\nseen in Figure 1 below, there is a gradual upward trend in the registration of phishing URLs starting\nearly 2021, with a significant increase in June 2021. Though the new phishing URLs did not continue to\nbe registered at quite the frenzied rate we saw in June, throughout the summer, threat actors created\nnew travel-themed phishing URLs at a much higher level than at any time in 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Number of new travel-themed phishing URLs registered between October 2019 and August\n2021.\nBased on the new phishing URLs that Unit 42 observed, in addition to the use of bespoke/new\ndomains for serving the phishing URLs, threat actors also leveraged URL shorteners such as bit.ly and\nbit.do, and services such as Firebase that are hosted on Google Cloud Storage. Firebase is backed by\nGoogle and supports developers of mobile or web applications. Firebase includes cloud storage that\nenables developers to store and serve user-generated content. As Firebase leverages Google Cloud\nStorage, it is possible for phishing URLs to take advantage of it to bypass email protections based on\nGoogle’s reputation.\n\nUnit 42 observed that not all the phishing URLs that threat actors leveraged were used for directed\nattacks or campaigns; some of the URLs were used in malspam campaigns to host malicious content,\nsuch as Dridex.\n\n### Use of Travel-themed Phishing URLs by Dridex\n\nDridex is mass-distribution malware that is typically sent through malspam. Dridex has been known as\nan information-stealing malware or banking trojan that targets Windows platforms and is distributed via\nmalicious spam attachments impersonating legitimate companies.\n\nThe threat actor behind Dridex generally uses billing- or invoice-themed emails, a tactic used by most\nmass-distribution malware. The compromised or malicious URLs host the initial installer for Dridex to\nestablish backdoor access. The backdoor access established by Dridex is later used to distribute\nfollowup malware, including ransomware, if the initial infection is not discovered.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe domains associated with the compromised URLs leveraged by Dridex are usually legitimate but\ncompromised websites. For most Dridex campaigns, these URLs are used for a single day before the\ncampaign moves on to a different URL.\n\nUnit 42 researchers have observed two types of malspam pushing Dridex in the past few months: (1) a\nphishing email with an Excel spreadsheet attachment, and (2) a phishing email with a link to a\nmessage to download an Excel spreadsheet.\n\nFigure 2. Infection chain for phishing emails with an Excel spreadsheet attachment.\n\nFigure 3. Infection chain for phishing emails linked to a message to download an Excel spreadsheet.\n[Unit 42 has published multiple articles over the past few years using the tag “Dridex.”](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/dridex/)\n\nFrom the newly registered phishing URLs, Unit 42 observed that a couple of phishing URLs with travelrelated keywords – “airlines” and “vacation” – were used by Dridex in 2021. These URLs are:\n\nanimalairlines[.]org/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-seo/inc/options/tk2xzwhphujenf.php\nsoleravacation[.]net/wp-content/plugins/mojo-marketplace-wp-plugin-isbroke/inc/cli/mxq6awnfhnmadd2.php\n\n**Technical Details About**\n\n**animalairlines[.]org/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-seo/inc/options/tk2xzwhphujenf.php**\n\nIn January 2021, there was a malspam campaign that comprised emails that used Dropbox links to call\nanimalairlines[.]org/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-seo/inc/options/tk2xzwhphujenf.php and download\nthe malware DLL to install Dridex.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4.

have targeted multiple organizations within the travel industry and have used Firebase to\nhost phishing pages to either target employees working in the travel industry or customers. Some of\nthe organizations that have been targeted by Firebase-hosted web applications include an online\nmarketplace for vacation rentals, upscale hotel chains, resort management companies and airline\ncompanies such as Tui.\n\nAs mentioned above, Firebase is backed by Google and supports developers of mobile or web\napplications, allowing them to store content in Google Cloud Storage. Unit 42 observed attackers\ntaking advantage of the inherent legitimacy of the Google Firebase domain to deceive targets and to\nbypass security filters that block domains and files that are known to be malicious. Once Unit 42\nnotified Google, it immediately removed and blocked these phishing URLs to prevent further threat\nactor activity.\n\nA sample of phishing URLs hosted on Firebase include:\n\n**URL** **Purpose**\n\n\nfirebasestorage[.]googleapis[.]com/v0/b/owambe4ce77.appspot.com/o/arsenaldozens/index%20copy%202.html?\nalt=media%26token=bbb56e5d-96d2-4da7-a82fe0bfed8d24c3%26email=creader@palaceresorts.com\n\n\nTargeting\nemployees\nworking in the\ntravel industry.\n\n\n-----\n\nehdewbml[.]firebaseapp[.]com/01iofurjdor.html#iuser=corp@tui.ru Targeting\nemployees\nworking in the\ntravel industry.\n\n## How Attackers Use the Data Gathered Through Phishing\n\nCybercriminals often want to monetize any “data” that they acquire through attacks, and data gathered\nabout travelers or organizations operating in the travel sector is no different. We have observed that\nthreat actors monetize data by selling stolen account credentials, stolen customer data or stolen\npayment information.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Unit 42 researchers noticed the supply for travel-themed services and products\nin underground markets drastically decreased (see Figure 5), possibly due to the global travel\nrestrictions. However, we expect that both supply and demand will increase as the world reopens for\ntravel.\n\nFigure 5. Travel-themed products and services listed in underground marketplaces, October 2019March 2021. (Data for later months not available.)\n\n### Stolen Account Credentials\n\nThere are two main reasons criminals are attracted by data sets containing stolen usernames, emails\nand passwords. First, they give criminals access to victims’ mileage or hotel points, which can easily be\nresold for profit. Second, the credentials can easily be used for compromising and taking over victims’\naccounts on other platforms, if the same credentials were used. With all the potential financial gains\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom stolen login credentials, the strong demand in underground marketplaces encourages threat\nactors to actively acquire this data through social engineering, brute-forcing or exploiting vulnerable\nsystems.\n\n### Stolen Customer Data\n\nOrganizations in the travel industry have access to a wealth of data, including personally identifiable\ninformation (PII), payment information and the contact information of customers. In the recent SITA\npassenger service system attack, 4.5 million global data subjects were compromised. While\nresearchers attributed the attack to APT41, it was observed that financially motivated criminals also\nshowed interest in this data.\n\nThere are three possible ways cybercriminals can abuse this type of data.\n\n1. Identity theft: Using stolen individual information collected from website A to create new\n\naccounts on website B. Because victims are not aware of these accounts on website B, they are\nless likely to be notified until later.\n2. Reconnaissance: Using the information for reconnaissance and setting the stage for spear\n\nphishing attacks.\n3. Resale of data: Data can easily be resold to other criminals, fraudsters or illicit marketing service\n\nproviders for further abuse.\n\n### Stolen Payment Information\n\nCybercriminals have been offering a “shadow travel agency” service for years. They reach out to\nindividual travelers through various social media or instant messaging platforms such as Telegram,\nproviding flight bookings, hotel reservations, car rentals, car rides and sightseeing tours with heavily\ndiscounted prices. While travelers transfer clean money to the “shadow travel agency,” the “shadow\ntravel agency” pays the actual service providers such as hotels or airlines with stolen payment\ninformation. Due to the time gap in payment processing, service providers only realize they have been\ndefrauded when they see the disputed card transactions or chargebacks weeks or months later.\n\nThere are three groups of victims in this scenario. The first victim group is the payment information\nowners and stolen credit card holders. The second victim group is the travelers who were unknowingly\na part of the money laundering process, giving cybercriminals opportunities to cash out the stolen\npayment information they previously collected. Travel industry organizations are considered the third\nvictim group; they are the most impacted in this scheme. Not only did they fail to profit from the\nproducts and services they provided, but they also had to cover the costs and chargeback penalties, as\nwell as addressing the reputational impacts of the crime.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Abuse of stolen payment information by threat actors.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe travel industry and international travelers have been long-term targets for cybercriminals, suffering\nfinancial and reputational damage. Threat actors not only sell fabricated information but also stolen\ninformation that they gather through phishing attacks. During the pandemic, we noticed that travelthemed products and services offered by cybercriminals in underground marketplaces decreased\nsignificantly, possibly due to low demand. However, as travel resumes, we expect travelers and the\ntravel industry to be targeted again due to the high profitability associated with this data. Therefore, it is\nimportant to be aware of phishing campaigns.\n\nBest practices to protect yourself and your organization from phishing attacks include:\n\n**For individuals:**\n\nExercise caution when clicking on any links or attachments contained in suspicious emails,\nespecially those relating to one’s account settings or personal information, or otherwise trying to\nconvey a sense of urgency.\nVerify the sender’s address for any suspicious emails in your inbox.\nDouble-check the URL and security certificate of each website before inputting your login\ncredentials.\nReport suspected phishing attempts.\n\n**For organizations:**\n\nImplement security awareness training to improve employees’ ability to identify fraudulent emails.\nRegularly back up your organization’s data as a defense against ransomware attacks initiated via\nphishing emails.\nEnforce multi-factor authentication on all business-related logins as an added layer of security.\n\n\n-----\n\nPalo Alto
