Multiple solutions, watchlists, and warnings are designed to ensure that companies and\nend users patch their software against known security vulnerabilities.\n\nUnfortunately, even with tools available and teams forewarned with up-to-date information, this often\ndoes not happen in a timely manner or even at all. This is usually due to outdated software,\noverworked teams, or even negligence or incompetence—and threat actors know this. Patching is\noften mundane and tedious work. Organizations that are either late, inconsistent, or sloppy in\napplying patches often become victims by presenting an opening to threat actors searching for an\nexploitable foothold.\n\n[Case in point, CVE-2017-0199 and](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-0199) [CVE-2017-11882 are almost over five years old, but they are still](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2017-11882)\nbeing exploited. Worse, both vulnerabilities have had official patches for some time, yet they continue\nto be exploited.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this blog, we will examine a recent instance of SmokeLoader, a malware variant that exploits both\nof these CVEs in its deployment chain. SmokeLoader (also known as Dofoil) has been available on\nthe market in one form or another since 2011. Its primary purpose is to support the distribution of\nother malware families, such as Trickbot. This latest sample drops zgRAT, a somewhat rare payload\ncompared to what SmokeLoader usually delivers.\n\n**Affected Platforms: Windows**\n\n**Impacted Users: Windows users**\n\n**Impact: Potential to deploy additional malware for additional purposes**\n\n**Severity Level: Medium**\n\n## Looking at each element of the attack\n\nI will examine each attack element in the following sections, including the initial email, attachments,\nand executables.\n\n### The phishing email\n\nLike many phishing stories, this one starts with a lure urging the recipient to review a purchase order\nand check for dates related to shipping times to ensure they are correct. This email was sent to a\nwebmail address hosted by a large telecommunications company in Taiwan. The phishing email’s\nsender also used this service, making it impossible to trace the precise origin of the message. Oddly,\nand perhaps a tell that this is a phishing attempt, the sender spoofed the recipient’s address and\nused it as the sending address.\n\nThe body text is a mix of Chinese and English and goes to some degree of trouble to look as\nlegitimate as possible, showing a full signature with contact details.\n\nFigure 1. Phishing email.\n\nFigure 2. Phishing email translation to English.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, the file “Purchase Order FG-20220629.xlsx” is attached to the email. Opening\nthis file begins the process of infection.\n\n### Purchase Order FG-20220629.xlsx\n\nFigure 3. Spreadsheet as it would appear to the recipient.\n\nWhen opened, the recipient is presented with a fairly standard view of a pixelated image and faux\nMicrosoft instructions on viewing protected content.\n\nGiven there aren’t any macros, a closer look at the internals of the spreadsheet is needed. The lock\nicon for Sheet2 shows that there is likely an encrypted or protected sheet. A tool like oledump from\nDidier Stevens can help in a situation like this.\n\nFigure 4. oledump output showing an encrypted stream.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter running oledump, it becomes evident that there is an encrypted stream in the file that most\nlikely includes some details of interest. Another tool by Didier Stevens – msoffcrypto-crack.py – can\nbe checked for obvious and well-used passwords.\n\nFigure 5. msoffcrypto-crack.py output showing the password of the file.\n\nIn this instance, a return of “VelvetSweatshop” is given. This is interesting as this is effectively a\ndefault document password recognized by Excel. It allows data to be encrypted but won’t prompt a\nuser to enter a password to access the file.\n\nBy combining the two tools mentioned above using a pipe (“|”), the full decrypted scope of the OLE\nstream in question is provided, and the target of the next stage of the attack is shown. This stage\nuses the first of the two exploits involved in this attack, CVE-2017-0199. It also includes an\nembedded link that will attempt to download the file “receipt.doc” from 192[.]227[.]129[.]26\n\nFigure 6. The ultimate target for the spreadsheet after exploiting CVE-2017-0199.\n\nFigure 7. Oddities in the file evident from the Exif data.\n\nInitial analysis of “receipt.doc” turns up some interesting oddities. As shown in Figure 7, Exiftool (a\ntool for examining file metadata) returns an error when run against “receipt.doc”. Opening the file and\nviewing it directly shows the scope of what is being attempted.\n\nFigure 8. “receipt.doc” as it would appear to anyone viewing it.\n\nIt becomes immediately apparent that this file is not a Microsoft Word document. Instead, it is a Rich\nText File (RTF). This file is designed to take advantage of the second of the two vulnerabilities\nmention, CVE-2017-11882, a stack overflow vulnerability in the Microsoft Equation Editor that\nenables remote code execution on a vulnerable system.\n\nFigure 9. The ultimate target for the spreadsheet after exploiting CVE-2017-11882.\n\nThe “receipt.doc” file reaches out again to 192[.]227[.]129[.]26 and downloads vbc.exe. This is\nSmokeLoader.\n\n### vbc.exe\n\nStarting at the beginning with “vbc.exe” and viewing its details as seen by the operating system, this\nfile presents itself as a Microsoft .NET executable.\n\nFigure 10. Basic executable details for “vbc.exe”.\n\nA review of the metadata for the file shows a basic level of misdirection.\n\nFigure 11. Exif data showing “vbc.exe” obfuscating its true purpose.\n\nThe file is described as “WinRAR” (legitimate file compression and archiving software). In addition,\nthe original and current file names do not match, which is highly suspicious given the circumstances\nup to this point.\n\n\n-----\n\nViewing the executable in a .NET debugger or IDE offers more explicit details on what the program\nattempts to do and how.\n\nFigure 12. The ultimate target for “vbc.exe”.\n\nAn attempt to connect to the URL “sorathlions[.]com/wp-content/Vymxn_Zfbgctbp[.]jpg” will be made.\n\nFigure 13. Packet capture showing multiple connections over a very short period.\n\nIf a connection cannot be made, numerous retries occur. However, they are done at a very fast rate\n(several per minute) that would present a detection opportunity given the uncharacteristic and\nceaseless attempts to connect to this location.\n\nFigure 14. If “vbc.exe” successfully connects to its C2, it will execute the above command.\n\nA successful connection will pull the file “Vymxn_Zfbgctbp.jpg” from its remote location, and the\ncommand in Figure 14 will be executed.\n\n### Vymxn_Zfbgctbp.jpg\n\nThe code in Figures 12 and 14 indicates that “Vymxn_Zfbgctbp.jpg” may not be an image file as\nclaimed.\n\nFigure 15. Exif data confirms that “Vymxn_Zfbgctbp.jpg” is not an image.\n\nA review of the file’s metadata shows that it appears to be a compressed GZip archive. Figure 12\nappears to bear this out, with the code to decompress the file in memory. In the absence of that, the\nfile can be decompressed manually using common tools like 7Zip.\n\nFigure 16. Demonstrating “Vymxn_Zfbgctbp.jpg” can be decompressed manually.\n\nFigure 17. The final file to be dropped is a DLL.\n\nAs Figure 17 shows, the file that gets dropped is a .NET DLL that would be executed by “vbc.exe”.\n\n### DLL\n\nThe DLL is heavily obfuscated. However, it’s still possible to pick out the primary namespace, class,\nand entry function.\n\nFigure 18. Primary namespace.\n\nBased on some of the non-obfuscated strings in this DLL, FortiGuard Labs believes this sample is\nzgRAT. Samples of zgRAT date back to 2021. It is a somewhat rare malware variant compared to\nother more established lines.\n\nThis particular sample makes no effort to communicate out and mostly idles without taking any\nfurther offensive action.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-2017-11882 were discovered in 2017, they are still being actively\nexploited in this and other malware campaigns. This demonstrates that malware authors still achieve\ntheir aims by relying on aging vulnerabilities, often several years after coming to light, and banking on\naffected solutions not being fixed.\n\nThe staying power of SmokeLoader, shown by its relative longevity compared to other threats, shows\nno signs of slowing down for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Fortinet Protections\n\nThe samples mentioned in this blog are detected by the following (AV) signatures:\n\nVBA/Agent.BMW!tr.dldr\n\nMSOffice/CVE_2017_11882.B!exploit\n\nMSIL/Agent.MJR!tr.dldr\n\nMSIL/Injector.VZX!tr\n\nFortiGuard IPS protects against all known exploits associated with the CVE-2017-0199 with the\nfollowing signature:\n\nMS.Office.RTF.File.OLE.autolink.Code.Execution\n\nFortiGuard IPS protects against all known exploits associated with the CVE-2017-11882 with the\nfollowing signature:\n\nMS.Office.EQNEDT32.EXE.Equation.Parsing.Memory.Corruption\n\nAll network-based URIs are blocked by the WebFiltering client.\n\nFortinet has multiple solutions designed to help train users to understand and detect phishing threats:\n\nThe [FortiPhish Phishing Simulation Service uses real-world simulations to help organizations test](https://www.fortinet.com/products/phishing-simulation)\nuser awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when\nusers encounter targeted phishing attacks.\n\nIn addition to these protections, we suggest that organizations also have their end users go through\nour FREE [NSE training:](https://training.fortinet.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=nse-institute) [NSE 1 – Information Security Awareness.
