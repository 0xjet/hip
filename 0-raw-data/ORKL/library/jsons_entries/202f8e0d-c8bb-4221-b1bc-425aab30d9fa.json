The SVR\nprimarily targets government networks, think tank and policy analysis organizations, and information\ntechnology companies. On 15 April 2021, the White House released a statement on the recent\nSolarWinds compromise, attributing the activity to the SVR. For additional detailed information on\nidentified vulnerabilities and mitigations, see the National Security Agency (NSA), Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and FBI Cybersecurity Advisory titled “Russian SVR Targets\nU.S. and Allied Networks,” released on 15 April 2021.\n\nThe FBI and DHS are providing information on the SVR’s cyber tools, targets, techniques, and\ncapabilities to aid organizations in conducting their own investigations and securing their networks.\n\n## THREAT OVERVIEW\n\nSVR cyber operations have posed a longstanding threat to the United States. Prior to 2018, several\nprivate cyber security companies published reports about APT 29 operations to obtain access to\nvictim networks and steal information, highlighting the use of customized tools to maximize stealth\ninside victim networks and APT 29 actors’ ability to move within victim environments undetected.\n\nBeginning in 2018, the FBI observed the SVR shift from using malware on victim networks to\ntargeting cloud resources, particularly e-mail, to obtain information. The exploitation of Microsoft\nOffice 365 environments following network access gained through use of modified SolarWinds\nsoftware reflects this continuing trend. Targeting cloud resources probably reduces the likelihood of\ndetection by using compromised accounts or system misconfigurations to blend in with normal or\nunmonitored traffic in an environment not well defended, monitored, or understood by victim\norganizations.\n\n_To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact_\n_your local FBI field office at_ _[www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field, or the FBI’s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) at](http://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field)_\n_(855) 292-3937 or by e-mail at_ _[CyWatch@fbi.gov.

The actors conducted the password\nspraying activity in a “low and slow” manner, attempting a small number of passwords at infrequent\nintervals, possibly to avoid detection. The password spraying used a large number of IP addresses all\nlocated in the same country as the victim, including those associated with residential, commercial,\nmobile, and The Onion Router (TOR) addresses.\n\nThe organization unintentionally exempted the compromised administrator’s account from multi-factor\nauthentication requirements. With access to the administrative account, the actors modified\npermissions of specific e-mail accounts on the network, allowing any authenticated network user to\nread those accounts.\n\nThe actors also used the misconfiguration for compromised non-administrative accounts. That\nmisconfiguration enabled logins using legacy single-factor authentication on devices which did not\nsupport multi-factor authentication. The FBI suspects this was achieved by spoofing user agent\nstrings to appear to be older versions of mail clients, including Apple’s mail client and old versions of\nMicrosoft Outlook. After logging in as a non-administrative user, the actors used the permission\nchanges applied by the compromised administrative user to access specific mailboxes of interest\nwithin the victim organization.\n\nWhile the password sprays were conducted from many different IP addresses, once the actors\nobtained access to an account, that compromised account was generally only accessed from a single\nIP address corresponding to a leased virtual private server (VPS). The FBI observed minimal overlap\nbetween the VPSs used for different compromised accounts, and each leased server used to conduct\nfollow-on actions was in the same country as the victim organization.\n\nDuring the period of their access, the actors consistently logged into the administrative account to\nmodify account permissions, including removing their access to accounts presumed to no longer be of\ninterest, or adding permissions to additional accounts.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nTo defend from this technique, the FBI and DHS recommend network operators to follow best\npractices for configuring access to cloud computing environments, including:\n\n     - Mandatory use of an approved multi-factor authentication solution for all users from both on\npremises and remote locations.\n\n     - Prohibit remote access to administrative functions and resources from IP addresses and\nsystems not owned by the organization.\n\n     - Regular audits of mailbox settings, account permissions, and mail forwarding rules for\nevidence of unauthorized changes.\n\n\nFBI | DHS | CISA\n#### TLP:WHITE\n\n\n-----\n\nFBI | DHS | CISA\n#### TLP:WHITE\n\n     - Where possible, enforce the use of strong passwords and prevent the use of easily guessed\nor commonly used passwords through technical means, especially for administrative\naccounts.\n\n     - Regularly review the organization’s password management program.\n\n     - Ensure the organization’s information technology (IT) support team has well-documented\nstandard operating procedures for password resets of user account lockouts.\n\n     - Maintain a regular cadence of security awareness training for all company employees.\n\n### Leveraging Zero-Day Vulnerability\n\nIn a separate incident, SVR actors used CVE-2019-19781, a zero-day exploit at the time, against a\nvirtual private network (VPN) appliance to obtain network access. Following exploitation of the device\nin a way that exposed user credentials, the actors identified and authenticated to systems on the\nnetwork using the exposed credentials.\n\nThe actors worked to establish a foothold on several different systems that were not configured to\nrequire multi-factor authentication and attempted to access web-based resources in specific areas of\nthe network in line with information of interest to a foreign intelligence service.\n\nFollowing initial discovery, the victim attempted to evict the actors. However, the victim had not\nidentified the initial point of access, and the actors used the same VPN appliance vulnerability to\nregain access. Eventually, the initial access point was identified, removed from the network, and the\nactors were evicted. As in the previous case, the actors used dedicated VPSs located in the same\ncountry as the victim, probably to make it appear that the network traffic was not anomalous with\nnormal activity.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nTo defend from this technique, the FBI and DHS recommend network defenders ensure endpoint\nmonitoring solutions are configured to identify evidence of lateral movement within the network and:\n\n     - Monitor the network for evidence of encoded PowerShell commands and execution of network\nscanning tools, such as NMAP.\n\n     - Ensure host based anti-virus/endpoint monitoring solutions are enabled and set to alert if\nmonitoring or reporting is disabled, or if communication is lost with a host agent for more than\na reasonable amount of time.\n\n     - Require use of multi-factor authentication to access internal systems.\n\n     - Immediately configure newly-added systems to the network, including those used for testing or\ndevelopment work, to follow the organization’s security baseline and incorporate into\nenterprise monitoring tools.\n\n### WELLMESS Malware\n\nIn 2020, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States attributed intrusions\nperpetrated using malware known as WELLMESS to APT 29. WELLMESS was written in the Go\nprogramming language, and the previously-identified activity appeared to focus on targeting COVID\n\nFBI | DHS | CISA\n#### TLP:WHITE\n\n\n-----\n\nFBI | DHS | CISA\n#### TLP:WHITE\n\n19 vaccine development. The FBI’s investigation revealed that following initial compromise of a\nnetwork—normally through an unpatched, publicly-known vulnerability—the actors deployed\nWELLMESS. Once on the network, the actors targeted each organization’s vaccine research\nrepository and Active Directory servers. These intrusions, which mostly relied on targeting onpremises network resources, were a departure from historic tradecraft, and likely indicate new ways\nthe actors are evolving in the virtual environment. More information about the specifics of the malware\nused in this intrusion have been previously released and are referenced in the ‘Resources’ section of\nthis document.\n\n### Tradecraft Similarities of SolarWinds-enabled Intrusions\n\nDuring the spring and summer of 2020, using modified SolarWinds network monitoring software as an\ninitial intrusion vector, SVR cyber operators began to expand their access to numerous networks. The\nSVR’s modification and use of trusted SolarWinds products as an intrusion vector is also a notable\ndeparture from the SVR’s historic tradecraft.\n\nThe FBI’s initial findings indicate similar post-infection tradecraft with other SVR-sponsored intrusions,\nincluding how the actors purchased and managed infrastructure used in the intrusions. After obtaining\naccess to victim networks, SVR cyber actors moved through the networks to obtain access to e-mail\naccounts. Targeted accounts at multiple victim organizations included accounts associated with IT\nstaff. The FBI suspects the actors monitored IT staff to collect useful information about the victim\nnetworks, determine if victims had detected the intrusions, and evade eviction actions.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nAlthough defending a network from a compromise of trusted software is difficult, some organizations\nsuccessfully detected and prevented follow-on exploitation activity from the initial malicious\nSolarWinds software. This was achieved using a variety of monitoring techniques including:\n\n     - Auditing log files to identify attempts to access privileged certificates and creation of fake\nidentify providers.\n\n     - Deploying software to identify suspicious behavior on systems, including the execution of\nencoded PowerShell.\n\n     - Deploying endpoint protection systems with the ability to monitor for behavioral indicators of\ncompromise.\n\n     - Using available public resources to identify credential abuse within cloud environments.\n\n     - Configuring authentication mechanisms to confirm certain user activities on systems, including\nregistering new devices.\n\nWhile few victim organizations were able to identify the initial access vector as SolarWinds software,\nsome were able to correlate different alerts to identify unauthorized activity. The FBI and DHS believe\nthose indicators, coupled with stronger network segmentation (particularly “zero trust” architectures or\nlimited trust between identity providers) and log correlation, can enable network defenders to identify\nsuspicious activity requiring additional investigation.\n\n\nFBI | DHS | CISA\n#### TLP:WHITE\n\n\n-----\n\nFBI | DHS | CISA\n#### TLP:WHITE\n\n### General Tradecraft Observations\n\nSVR cyber operators are capable adversaries. In addition to the techniques described above, FBI\ninvestigations have revealed infrastructure used in the intrusions is frequently obtained using false\nidentities and cryptocurrencies. VPS infrastructure is often procured from a network of VPS resellers.\nThese false identities are usually supported by low reputation infrastructure including temporary email accounts and temporary voice over internet protocol (VoIP) telephone numbers. While not\nexclusively used by SVR cyber actors, a number of SVR cyber personas use e-mail services hosted\non cock[.]li or related domains.\n\nThe FBI also notes SVR cyber operators have used open source or commercially available tools\ncontinuously, including Mimikatz—an open source credential-dumping too—and Cobalt Strike—a\ncommercially available exploitation tool.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nThe FBI and DHS recommend service providers strengthen their user validation and verification\nsystems to prohibit misuse of their services.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n     - [NSA, CISA, FBI, Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, Russian SVR Targets U.S. and Allied Networks](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Apr/15/2002621240/-1/-1/0/CSA_SVR_TARGETS_US_ALLIES_UOO13234021.PDF)\n\n     - [CISA, Remediating Networks Affected by the SolarWinds and Active Directory/M365](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/remediating-apt-compromised-networks)\n[Compromise](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/remediating-apt-compromised-networks)\n\n     - [CISA, Alert (AA21-008A), Detecting Post-Compromise Threat Activity in Microsoft Cloud](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-008a)\n[Environments](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-008a)\n\n     - FBI, CISA, ODNI, NSA, Joint Statement, [Joint Statement by the Federal Bureau of](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2021/item/2176-joint-statement-by-the-federal-bureau-of-investigation-fbi-the-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-cisa-the-office-of-the-director-of-national-intelligence-odni-and-the-national-security-agency-nsa)\n[Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Office of](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2021/item/2176-joint-statement-by-the-federal-bureau-of-investigation-fbi-the-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-cisa-the-office-of-the-director-of-national-intelligence-odni-and-the-national-security-agency-nsa)\n[the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), and the National Security Agency (NSA)](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2021/item/2176-joint-statement-by-the-federal-bureau-of-investigation-fbi-the-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-cisa-the-office-of-the-director-of-national-intelligence-odni-and-the-national-security-agency-nsa)\n\n     - [CISA, Alert (AA20-352A), Advanced Persistent Threat Compromise of Government Agencies,](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a)\n[Critical Infrastructure, and Private Sector Organizations](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a)\n\n     - CISA, CISA Insights, [What Every Leader Needs to Know about the Ongoing APT Cyber](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA%20Insights%20-%20What%20Every%20Leader%20Needs%20to%20Know%20About%20the%20Ongoing%20APT%20Cyber%20Activity%20-%20FINAL_508.pdf)\nActivity\n\n     - [FBI, CISA, Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, Advanced Persistent Threat Actors Targeting U.S.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA20-336A-APT_Actors_Targeting_US_ThinkTanks.pdf)\n[Think Tanks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA20-336A-APT_Actors_Targeting_US_ThinkTanks.pdf)\n\n     - [CISA, Malicious Activity Targeting COVID-19 Research, Vaccine Development](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/07/16/malicious-activity-targeting-covid-19-research-vaccine-development)\n\n     - NCSC, CSE, NSA, CISA, Advisory: [APT 29 targets COVID-19 vaccine development](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jul/16/2002457639/-1/-1/0/NCSC_APT29_ADVISORY-QUAD-OFFICIAL-20200709-1810.PDF)\n\n\nFBI | DHS | CISA\n#### TLP:WHITE\n\n\n-----",
