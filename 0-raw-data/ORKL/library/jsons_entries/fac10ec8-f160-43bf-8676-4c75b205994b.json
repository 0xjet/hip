However,\nBuckeye’s focus appears to have changed as of June 2015, when the group began\ncompromising political entities in Hong Kong. Since March 2016, the group has appeared to\nmostly focus on organizations in Hong Kong, sending malicious emails to targets as\nrecently as August 4, and attempting to spread within compromised networks in order to\nsteal information.\n\nUsing the combined threat intelligence of Symantec and Blue Coat Systems, we have built\na clear and concise picture of how Buckeye has evolved its tactics in recent years. This has\nallowed us to further enhance our protection capabilities against the group’s campaigns.\n\n## Background\n\nSymantec has observed Buckeye activity dating back to 2009, involving attacks on various\n[organizations in several regions. Buckeye used a remote access Trojan (Backdoor.Pirpi) in](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-110314-3703-99)\nattacks against a US organization’s network in 2009. The group delivered Backdoor.Pirpi\nthrough malicious attachments or links in convincing spear-phishing emails. Symantec has\nidentified additional tools used by the group, which will be discussed later.\n\nBuckeye has been known to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in the past, such as CVE-2010[3962 in an campaign in 2010 and CVE-2014-1776 in 2014. Although other zero-day attacks](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-1776)\nhave been reported, they have not been confirmed by Symantec. All zero-day exploits\nknown, or suspected, to have been used by this group are for vulnerabilities in Internet\nExplorer and Flash.\n\n## Shifting focus of attacks\n\n\n-----\n\nMore recently, Symantec telemetry has revealed Backdoor.Pirpi connections from\ncompromised computers based in Hong Kong dating back to August 2015. The infections\nsignificantly increased in number towards the end of March 2016 and the beginning of April\n2016. Additional investigations discovered related malware samples and determined that\ntargeted organizations were political entities in Hong Kong.\n\nIn at least some of these recent attacks, Buckeye used spear-phishing emails with a\nmalicious .zip attachment. The .zip archive attached to the email contains a Windows\nshortcut (.lnk) file with the Microsoft Internet Explorer logo. Clicking on the shortcut\nultimately leads to Backdoor.Pirpi being downloaded and executed on the affected\ncomputer.\n\n## Who’s being targeted?\n\nFrom 2015 to date, Symantec identified approximately 82 organizations in various regions\nthat had Buckeye tools present on their network. However, this is not an accurate picture of\nthe targets of interest to Buckeye. The group casts a wide net while trawling for targets but\nonly remains active on the networks of organizations it is interested in. Symantec\ndetermined a more accurate picture of Buckeye’s targets by looking at where Buckeye\nremained active on the network longer than a day, deployed additional tools, and spread\nonto multiple computers. After these filters were applied to our data, we found a total of 17\norganizations, located in Hong Kong (13), the US (3), and the UK (1).\n\n_Figure 1. Buckeye victims of interest by region (2015 to date)_\n\nIt should be noted that this data goes back to 2015 and that the proportion of targets in\nHong Kong from March 2016 would be considerably higher. Up to mid-2015, Buckeye’s\ntraditional targets were varying categories of US organizations, which match the types of\n\n\n-----\n\nvictims seen in the UK. Buckeye interests changed substantially around June 2015 when\nthe group began infecting organizations in Hong Kong. Infections in the UK and US ceased\nshortly after this time.\n\n_Figure 2. Organizations that Buckeye targeted over time, per region_\n\n## Malware and tools\n\nBuckeye uses a number of hacking tools as well as malware. Many of the hacking tools are\nopen source applications that have been patched or modified in some manner by Buckeye\nin an attempt to evade detection.\n\nBuckeye uses Backdoor.Pirpi, a remote access Trojan capable of reading, writing, and\nexecuting files and programs. Backdoor.Pirpi also collects information about the target’s\nlocal network, including the domain controller and workstations.\n\nAs mentioned previously, Buckeye also uses a number of hacking tools, including the\nfollowing:\n\n**Keylogger: The keylogger is configured using the command line parameters:**\nNetworkService, Replace, Install, Register and Unregister. These parameters install it as a\nservice. The keylogger then records keystrokes in encrypted files, for example:\nthumbcache_96.dbx. It also gathers network information such as the MAC address, IP\naddress, WINS, DHCP server, and gateway.\n\n**RemoteCMD: This tool executes commands on remote computers, similar to the PsExec**\ntool. Usage is: %s shareIp domain [USER INFORMATION|[USER NAME AND\nPASSWORD]] [/run:[COMMAND]]\n\nThe commands to be passed consist of upload, download, Service (create, delete, start,\nstop), delete, rename, and AT\n\n\n-----\n\n**PwDumpVariant: This tool imports lsremora.dll (often downloaded by the attacker as part**\nof the toolset) and uses the GetHash export of this DLL. On execution, the tool injects itself\ninto lsass.exe and is triggered with the argument “dig”.\n\n**OSinfo: OSInfo is a general purpose, system information gathering tool. It has the following**\ncommand line argument help:\n\ninfo <Server/Domain> [options]\n\n[options]:\n-d Domain\n-o OsInfo\n-t TsInfo\n-n NetuseInfo\n-s ShareInfo ShareDir\n-c Connect Test\n-a Local And Global Group User Info\n-l Local Group User Info\n-g Global Group User Info\n-ga Group Administrators\n-gp Group Power Users\n-gd Group Domain Admins\n-f <infile> //input server list from infile, OneServerOneLine\ninfo <\\\\server> <user>\n\n**ChromePass: A tool from NirSoft used for recovering passwords stored in the Chrome**\nbrowser.\n\n**Lazagne: A compiled Python tool that extracts passwords from various locally installed**\napplication classes, such as web browsers. The full list is: chats, svn, wifi, mails, windows,\ndatabase, sysadmin, and browsers.\n\nBuckeye seems to target file and print servers, which makes it likely the group is looking to\nsteal documents. This, coupled with the group’s use of zero-day exploits in the past,\ncustomized tools, and the types of organizations being targeted would suggest that\nBuckeye is a state-sponsored cyberespionage group.\n\n## Protection\n\nSymantec, Norton, and Blue Coat products protect against the activities of this\ncyberespionage group.\n\nSymantec and Norton products offer the following detections:\n\n**Antivirus**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Intrusion prevention system**\n\n[System Infected: Backdoor.Pirpi Activity 3](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=27577)\n\n**Update–September 14, 2016:**\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\nWe have compiled a list of indicators of compromise for the campaigns described in this\nblog.\n\n\n-----",
