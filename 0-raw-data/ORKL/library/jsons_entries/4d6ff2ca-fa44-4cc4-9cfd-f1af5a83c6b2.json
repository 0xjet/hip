From their high volume 0day deployment to their innovative and broad malware set,](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/apt-advanced-persistent-threats/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\nSofacy is one of the top groups that we monitor, report, and protect against. 2017 was not\nany different in this regard. Our private reports subscription customers receive a steady\nstream of [YARA, IOC, and reports on Sofacy, our most reported APT for the year.](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/yara/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\n\nThis high level of cyber-espionage activity goes back years. In 2011-2012, the group used a\nrelatively tiny implant (known as “Sofacy” or SOURFACE) as their first stage malware, which\nat the time had similarities with the old Miniduke implants. This made us believe the two\ngroups were connected, although it looks they split ways at a certain point, with the original\nMiniduke group switching to the CosmicDuke implant in 2014. The division in malware was\nconsistent and definitive at that point.\n\nIn 2013, the Sofacy group expanded their arsenal and added more backdoors and tools,\nincluding CORESHELL, SPLM (aka Xagent, aka CHOPSTICK), JHUHUGIT (which is built\nwith code from the Carberp sources) AZZY (aka ADVSTORESHELL NETUI EVILTOSS\n\n\n-----\n\nand spans across 4-5 generations) and a few others. We ve seen quite a few versions of\nthese implants, which were relatively widespread at some point or still are. In 2015 we\nnoticed [another wave of attacks which took advantage of a new release of the AZZY implant,](https://securelist.com/sofacy-apt-hits-high-profile-targets-with-updated-toolset/72924/)\nlargely undetected by antivirus products. The new wave of attacks included a new generation\nof USB stealers deployed by Sofacy, with initial versions dating to February 2015. It\nappeared to be geared exclusively towards high profile targets.\n\nSofacy’s reported presence in the DNC network alongside APT29 brought possibly the\nhighest level of public attention to the group’s activities in 2016, especially when data from\nthe compromise was leaked and “weaponized”. And later 2016, their focus turned towards\nthe Olympics’ and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and Court of Arbitration for Sports\n(CAS), when individuals and servers in these organizations were phished and compromised.\nIn a similar vein with past CyberBerkut activity, attackers hid behind anonymous activist\ngroups like “anonpoland”, and data from victimized organizations were similarly leaked and\n“weaponized”.\n\nThis write-up will survey notables in the past year of 2017 Sofacy activity, including their\ntargeting, technology, and notes on their infrastructure. No one research group has 100%\nglobal visibility, and our collected data is presented accordingly. Here, external APT28\n[reports on 2017 Darkhotel-style activity](https://securelist.com/the-darkhotel-apt/66779/) [in Europe and](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/apt28-targets-hospitality-sector-presents-threat-travelers) [Dealer’s Choice spearphishing are of](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/12/unit42-let-ride-sofacy-groups-dealerschoice-attacks-continue/)\ninterest. From where we sit, 2017 Sofacy activity starts with a heavy focus on NATO and\nUkrainian partners, coinciding with lighter interest in Central Asian targets, and finishing the\nsecond half of the year with a heavy focus on Central Asian targets and some shift further\nEast.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Dealer’s Choice\n\nThe beginning of 2017 began with a slow cleanup following the Dealer’s Choice campaign,\nwith technical characteristics documented by our colleagues at Palo Alto in several stages at\nthe end of 2016. The group spearphished targets in several waves with Flash exploits\nleading to their carberp based JHUHUGIT downloaders and further stages of malware. It\nseems that many folks did not log in and pull down their emails until Jan 2017 to retrieve the\nDealer’s Choice spearphish. Throughout these waves, we observed that the targets provided\nconnection, even tangential, to Ukraine and NATO military and diplomatic interests.\n\nIn multiple cases, Sofacy spoofs the identity of a target, and emails a spearphish to other\ntargets of interest. Often these are military or military-technology and manufacturing related,\nand here, the DealersChoice spearphish is again NATO related:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe global reach that coincided with this focus on NATO and the Ukraine couldn’t be\noverstated. Our KSN data showed spearphishing targets geolocated across the globe into\n2017.\n\nAM, AZ, FR, DE, IQ, IT, KG, MA, CH, UA, US, VN\n\nDealersChoice emails, like the one above, that we were able to recover from third party\nsources provided additional targeting insight, and confirmed some of the targeting within our\nKSN data:\n\nTR, PL, BA, AZ, KR, LV, GE, LV, AU, SE, BE\n\n## 0day Deployment(s)\n\nSofacy kicked off the year deploying two 0day in a spearphish document, both a Microsoft\n[Office encapsulated postscript type confusion exploit (abusing CVE-2017-0262) and an](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-0262)\n[escalation of privilege use-after-free exploit (abusing CVE-2017-0263). The group attempted](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-0263)\nto deploy this spearphish attachment to push a small 30kb backdoor known as GAMEFISH\nto targets in Europe at the beginning of 2017. They took advantage of the Syrian military\nconflict for thematic content and file naming “Trump’s_Attack_on_Syria_English.docx”.\nAgain, this deployment was likely a part of their focus on NATO targets.\n\n## Light SPLM deployment in Central Asia and Consistent Infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\nMeanwhile in early-to-mid 2017, SPLM/CHOPSTICK/XAgent detections in Central Asia\nprovided a glimpse into ongoing focus on ex-Soviet republics in Central Asia. These\nparticular detections are interesting because they indicate an attempted selective 2nd stage\ndeployment of a backdoor maintaining filestealer, keylogger, and remoteshell functionality to\na system of interest. As the latest revision of the backdoor, portions of SPLM didn’t match\nprevious reports on SPLM/XAgent while other similarities were maintained. SPLM 64-bit\nmodules already appeared to be at version 4 of the software by May of the year. Targeting\nprofiles included defense related commercial and military organizations, and\ntelecommunications.\n\nTargeting included TR, KZ, AM, KG, JO, UK, UZ\n\n## Heavy Zebrocy deployments\n\nSince mid-November 2015, the threat actor referred to as “Sofacy” or “APT28” has been\nutilizing a unique payload and delivery mechanism written in Delphi and AutoIT. We\ncollectively refer to this package and related activity as “Zebrocy” and had written a few\nreports on its usage and development by June 2017 – Sofacy developers modified and\nredeployed incremented versions of the malware. The Zebrocy chain follows a pattern:\nspearphish attachment -> compiled Autoit script (downloader) -> Zebrocy payload. In some\ndeployments, we observed Sofacy actively developing and deploying a new package to a\nmuch smaller, specific subset of targets within the broader set.\n\n\n-----\n\nTargeting profiles, spearphish filenames, and lures carry thematic content related to visa\napplications and scanned images, border control administration, and various administrative\nnotes. Targeting appears to be widely spread across the Middle East, Europe, and Asia:\n\nBusiness accounting practices and standards\nScience and engineering centers\nIndustrial and hydrochemical engineering and standards/certification\nMinistry of foreign affairs\nEmbassies and consulates\nNational security and intelligence agencies\nPress services\nTranslation services\nNGO – family and social service\nMinistry of energy and industry\n\nWe identified new MSIL components deployed by Zebrocy. While recent Zebrocy versioning\nwas 7.1, some of the related Zebrocy modules that drop file-stealing MSIL modules we call\nCovfacy were v7.0. The components were an unexpected inclusion in this particular toolset.\nFor example, one sent out to a handful of countries identifies network drives when they are\nadded to target systems, and then RC4-like-encrypts and writes certain file metadata and\ncontents to a local path for later exfiltration. The stealer searches for files 60mb and less with\nthese extensions:\n\n.doc\n.docx\n.xls\n.xlsx\n.ppt\n.pptx\n.exe\n.zip\n.rar\n\nAt execution, it installs an application-defined Windows hook. The hook gets windows\nmessages indicating when a network drive has been attached. Upon adding a network drive,\nthe hook calls its “RecordToFile” file stealer method.\n\n\n-----\n\nZebrocy spearphishing targets:\nAF, AM, AU, AZ, BD, BE, CN, DE, ES, FI, GE, IL, IN, JO, KW, KG, KZ, LB, LT, MN, MY, NL,\nOM, PK, PO, SA, ZA, SK, SE, CH, TJ, TM, TR, UA, UAE, UK, US, UZ\n\n## SPLM deployment in Central Asia\n\nSPLM/CHOPSTICK components deployed throughout 2017 were native 64-bit modular C++\nWindows COM backdoors supporting http over fully encrypted TLSv1 and TLSv1.2\ncommunications, mostly deployed in the second half of 2017 by Sofacy. Earlier SPLM activity\ndeployed 32-bit modules over unencrypted http (and sometimes smtp) sessions. In 2016 we\nsaw fully functional, very large SPLM/X-Agent modules supporting OS X.\n\nThe executable module continues to be part of a framework supporting various internal and\nexternal components communicating over internal and external channels, maintaining slightly\nmorphed encryption and functionality per deployment. Sofacy selectively used\nSPLM/CHOPSTICK modules as second stage implants to high interest targets for years now.\nIn a change from previous compilations, the module was structured and used to inject\nremote shell, keylogger, and filesystem add-ons into processes running on victim systems\nand maintaining functionality that was originally present within the main module.\n\nThe newer SPLM modules are deployed mostly to Central Asian based targets that may\nhave a tie to NATO in some form. These targets include foreign affairs government\norganizations both localized and abroad, and defense organizations’ presence localized,\n\n\n-----\n\nlocated in Europe and also located in Afghanistan. One outlier SPLM target profile within our\nvisibility includes an audit and consulting firm in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nMinor changes and updates to the code were released with these deployments, including a\nnew mutex format and the exclusive use of encrypted HTTP communications over TLS. The\ncompiled code itself already is altered per deployment in multiple subtle ways, in order to\nstymie identification and automated analysis and accommodate targeted environments.\nStrings (c2 domains and functionality, error messages, etc) are custom encrypted per\ndeployment.\n\nTargets: TR, KZ, BA, TM, AF, DE, LT, NL\n\n## SPLM/CHOPSTICK/XAgent Modularity and Infrastructure\n\nThis subset of SPLM/CHOPSTICK activity leads into several small surprises that take us into\n2018, to be discussed in further detail at SAS 2018. The group demonstrates malleability and\ninnovation in maintaining and producing familiar SPLM functionality, but the pragmatic and\nsystematic approach towards producing undetected or difficult-to-detect malware continues.\nChanges in the second stage SPLM backdoor are refined, making the code reliably modular.\n\n## Infrastructure Notes\n\nSofacy set up and maintained multiple servers and c2 for varying durations, registering fairly\nrecognizable domains with privacy services, registrars that accept bitcoin, fake phone\nnumbers, phony individual names, and 1 to 1 email address to domain registration\nrelationships. Some of this activity and patterns were publicly disclosed, so we expect to see\nmore change in their process in 2018. Also, throughout the year and in previous years,\nresearchers began to comment publicly on Sofacy’s fairly consistent infrastructure setup.\n\nAs always, attackers make mistakes and give away hints about what providers and registrars\nthey prefer. It’s interesting to note that this version of SPLM implements communications that\nare fully encrypted over HTTPS. As an example, we might see extraneous data in their\nSSL/TLS certificates that give away information about their provider or resources. Leading\nup to summer 2017, infrastructure mostly was created with PDR and Internet Domain\nService BS Corp, and their resellers. Hosting mostly was provided at Fast Serv Inc and\nresellers, in all likelihood related to bitcoin payment processing.\n\nAccordingly, the server side certificates appear to be generated locally on VPS hosts that\nexclusively are paid for at providers with bitcoin merchant processing. One certificate was\ngenerated locally on what appeared to be a HP-UX box, and another was generated on\n“8569985.securefastserver[.]com” with an email address\n“root@8569985.securefastserver[.]com”, as seen here for their nethostnet[.]com domain.\nThis certificate configuration is ignored by the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to other ip data, this data point suggested that Qhoster at\nhttps://www.qhoster[.]com was a VPS hosting reseller of choice at the time. It should be\nnoted that the reseller accepted Alfa Click, PayPal, Payza, Neteller, Skrill, WebMoney,\nPerfect Money, Bitcoin, Litecoin, SolidTrust Pay, CashU, Ukash, OKPAY, EgoPay,\npaysafecard, Alipay, MG, Western Union, SOFORT Banking, QIWI, Bank transfer for\npayment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSofacy, one of the most active APT we monitor, continues to spearphish their way into\ntargets, reportedly widely phishes for credentials, and infrequently participates in server side\n[activity (including host compromise with BeEF deployment, for example). KSN visibility and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ0zZ6Anb64&feature=youtu.be)\ndetections suggests a shift from their early 2017 high volume NATO spearphish targeting\ntowards the middle east and Central Asia, and finally moving their focus further east into late\n2017. Their operational security is good. Their campaigns appear to have broken out into\nsubsets of activity and malware involving GAMEFISH, Zebrocy, and SPLM, to name a few.\nTheir evolving and modified SPLM/CHOPSTICK/XAgent code is a long-standing part of\nSofacy activity, however much of it is changing. We’ll cover more recent 2018 change in their\n[targeting and the malware itself at SAS 2018.](https://sas.kaspersky.com/)\n\nWith a group like Sofacy, once their attention is detected on a network, it is important to\nreview logins and unusual administrator access on systems, thoroughly scan and sandbox\nincoming attachments, and maintain two factor authentication for services like email and vpn\naccess. In order to identify their presence, not only can you gain valuable insight into their\ntargeting from intelligence reports and gain powerful means of detections with hunting tools\nlike YARA, but out-of-band processing with a solution like KATA is important.\n\n## Technical Appendix\n\n### Related md5\n\n\n-----\n\n8f9f697aa6697acee70336f66f295837\n1a4b9a6b321da199aa6d10180e889313\n842454b48f5f800029946b1555fba7fc\nd4a5d44184333442f5015699c2b8af28\n1421419d1be31f1f9ea60e8ed87277db\nb1d1a2c64474d2f6e7a5db71ccbafa31\n953c7321c4959655fdd53302550ce02d\n57601d717fcf358220340675f8d63c8a\n02b79c468c38c4312429a499fa4f6c81\n85cd38f9e2c9397a18013a8921841a04\nf8e92d8b5488ea76c40601c8f1a08790\n66b4fb539806ce27be184b6735584339\ne8e1fcf757fe06be13bead43eaa1338c\n953c7321c4959655fdd53302550ce02d\naa2aac4606405d61c7e53140d35d7671\n85cd38f9e2c9397a18013a8921841a04\n57601d717fcf358220340675f8d63c8a\n16e1ca26bc66e30bfa52f8a08846613d\nf8e92d8b5488ea76c40601c8f1a08790\nb137c809e3bf11f2f5d867a6f4215f95\n237e6dcbc6af50ef5f5211818522c463\n88009adca35560810ec220544e4fb6aa\n2163a33330ae5786d3e984db09b2d9d2\n02b79c468c38c4312429a499fa4f6c81\n842454b48f5f800029946b1555fba7fc\nd4a5d44184333442f5015699c2b8af28\nb88633376fbb144971dcb503f72fd192\n8f9f697aa6697acee70336f66f295837\nb6f77273cbde76896a36e32b0c0540e1\n1a4b9a6b321da199aa6d10180e889313\n1421419d1be31f1f9ea60e8ed87277db\n1a4b9a6b321da199aa6d10180e889313\n9b10685b774a783eabfecdb6119a8aa3\naa34fb2e5849bff4144a1c98a8158970\naced5525ba0d4f44ffd01c4db2730a34\nb1d1a2c64474d2f6e7a5db71ccbafa31\nb924ff83d9120d934bb49a7a2e3c4292\ncdb58c2999eeda58a9d0c70f910d1195\nd4a5d44184333442f5015699c2b8af28\nd6f2bf2066e053e58fe8bcd39cb2e9ad\n34dc9a69f33ba93e631cd5048d9f2624\n1c6f8eba504f2f429abf362626545c79\n\n\n-----\n\n139c9ac0776804714ebe8b8d35a04641\ne228cd74103dc069663bb87d4f22d7d5\nbed5bc0a8aae2662ea5d2484f80c1760\n8c3f5f1fff999bc783062dd50357be79\n5882a8dd4446abd137c05d2451b85fea\n296c956fe429cedd1b64b78e66797122\n82f06d7157dd28a75f1fbb47728aea25\n9a975e0ddd32c0deef1318c485358b20\n529424eae07677834a770aaa431e6c54\n4cafde8fa7d9e67194d4edd4f2adb92b\nf6b2ef4daf1b78802548d3e6d4de7ba7\nede5d82bb6775a9b1659dccb699fadcb\n116d2fc1665ce7524826a624be0ded1c\n20ff290b8393f006eaf4358f09f13e99\n4b02dfdfd44df3c88b0ca8c2327843a4\nc789ec7537e300411d523aef74407a5e\n0b32e65caf653d77cab2a866ee2d9dbc\n27faa10d1bec1a25f66e88645c695016\n647edddf61954822ddb7ab3341f9a6c5\n2f04b8eb993ca4a3d98607824a10acfb\n9fe3a0fb3304d749aeed2c3e2e5787eb\n62deab0e5d61d6bf9e0ba83d9e1d7e2b\n86b607fe63c76b3d808f84969cb1a781\nf62182cf0ab94b3c97b0261547dfc6cf\n504182aaa5575bb38bf584839beb6d51\nd79a21970cad03e22440ea66bd85931f\n\n### Related domains\n\nnethostnet[.]com\n\nhostsvcnet[.]com\n\netcrem[.]net\n\nmovieultimate[.]com\n\nnewfilmts[.]com\n\nfastdataexchange[.]org\n\nliveweatherview[.]com\n\nanalyticsbar[.]org\n\nanalyticstest[.]net\n\nlifeofmentalservice[.]com\n\nmeteost[.]com\n\nrighttopregnantpower[.]com\n\nkiteim[.]org\n\nadobe-flash-updates[.]org\n\n\n-----\n\ngeneralsecurityscan[.]com\nglobalresearching[.]org\nlvueton[.]com\naudiwheel[.]com\nonline-reggi[.]com\nfsportal[.]net\nnetcorpscanprotect[.]com\nmvband[.]net\nmvtband[.]net\nviters[.]org\ntreepastwillingmoment[.]com\nsendmevideo[.]org\nsatellitedeluxpanorama[.]com\nppcodecs[.]com\nencoder-info[.]tk\nwmdmediacodecs[.]com\npostlkwarn[.]com\nshcserv[.]com\nversiontask[.]com\nwebcdelivery[.]com\nmiropc[.]org\nsecurityprotectingcorp[.]com\nuniquecorpind[.]com\nappexsrv[.]net\nadobeupgradeflash[.]com\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Backdoor](https://securelist.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Nation State Sponsored Espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/nation-state-sponsored-espionage/)\n[Sofacy](https://securelist.com/tag/sofacy/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Vulnerabilities and exploits](https://securelist.com/tag/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/)\n[Zebrocy](https://securelist.com/tag/zebrocy/)\n[Zero-day vulnerabilities](https://securelist.com/tag/zero-day-vulnerabilities/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\n\n-----\n\nA Slice of 2017 Sofacy Activity\n\nYour email address will not be published.
