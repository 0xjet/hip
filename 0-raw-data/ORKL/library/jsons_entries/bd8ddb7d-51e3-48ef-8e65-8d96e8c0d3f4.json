This is yet another indication of the origin of the\nmalware.\n\n**List of countries excluded from attacks** _(Zscaler)_\nFinally, an anti-debug feature blocks the operation of the mouse and keyboard inputs, making it\nfurther difficult for researchers to analyze the malware.\n\n## Outlook\n\n[Info-stealers are on the rise, with Redline,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/redline-malware-shows-why-passwords-shouldnt-be-saved-in-browsers/) [MarsStealer,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mars-stealer-malware-pushed-via-openoffice-ads-on-google/) [Vidar Stealer, and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vidar-stealer-abuses-mastodon-to-silently-get-c2-configuration/) [AZORult currently](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/azorult-malware-infects-victims-via-fake-protonvpn-installer/)\ndominating the space.\n\nThe exit of Raccoon Stealer, which was one of the biggest players, has left a gap in the\ncybercrime market, so other MaaS operators will try to take advantage of this development.\n\n[Daria Romana Pop, a threat analyst at KELA, has shared the following insights with Bleeping](https://ke-la.com/)\nComputer on the status of the info-stealers landscape:\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven the increase in usage and exploitation of compromised accounts and data obtained by\ninformation stealers as a vector for initial access to a target, KELA has recently observed new\nvariants being advertised on cybercrime forums, as threat actors aim at improving the malware\ncapabilities to better avoid detection and to advance the data collection and exfiltration\nprocesses.\"\n\n\"BlackGuard stealer launched in early 2021. As cybercriminals are constantly testing the\ncapabilities of such malicious tools, they do not shy away from demanding more quality and\nimprovements. KELA came across several recent discussions in which users were complaining\nabout BlackGuard not being able to properly avoid detection. As in any business, the operators\npromised to provide an updated version in no time.\"\n\n**Author of BlackGuard promising to improve anti-detection scheme** _(KELA)_\n\"In a different scenario, KELA identified META - a new information stealer very similar in\nappearance to RedLine, whose collected data is being sold on the TwoEasy botnet\nmarketplace. The stealer was launched at the beginning of March, now sold for USD125 per\nmonth or USD1000 for unlimited use, and the operators claim that it is an improved version of\nRedLine.\"\n\n**META info-stealer promoted on hacking forums** _(KELA)_\nTo protect yourself from all of the circulating info-stealing malware, avoid visiting shady websites\nand downloading files from untrustworthy or dubious sources.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, use two-factor authentication, keep your OS and applications up to date, and use strong\nand unique passwords for all your online accounts.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New powerful Prynt Stealer malware sells for just $100 per month](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-powerful-prynt-stealer-malware-sells-for-just-100-per-month/)\n\n[Fake Binance NFT Mystery Box bots steal victim's crypto wallets](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-binance-nft-mystery-box-bots-steal-victims-crypto-wallets/)\n\n[Fake Pixelmon NFT site infects you with password-stealing malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-pixelmon-nft-site-infects-you-with-password-stealing-malware/)\n\n[Eternity malware kit offers stealer, miner, worm, ransomware tools](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/eternity-malware-kit-offers-stealer-miner-worm-ransomware-tools/)\n\n[German automakers targeted in year-long malware campaign](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/german-automakers-targeted-in-year-long-malware-campaign/)\n\n[BlackGuard](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/blackguard/)\n[Credential Theft](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/credential-theft/)\n[Credentials](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/credentials/)\n[Info Stealer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/info-stealer/)\n[Information Stealer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/information-stealer/)\n[Password Stealing Trojan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/password-stealing-trojan/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience\nworking on various online publications.

Other concerns too, vulnerability like\nsending LNK malware via ZIP had been an issue. Luckily we can disable reading that\nextension entirely with Windows, with no default program set.
