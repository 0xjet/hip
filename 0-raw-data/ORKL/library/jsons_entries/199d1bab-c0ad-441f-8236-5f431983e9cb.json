    "plain_text": "# Uncovering the Anonymity Cloak\n\n**ke-la.com/uncovering-the-anonymity-cloak/**\n\nFebruary 19, 2020\n\nDue to its anonymity, the Darknet is flooded with threat actors working together to share\ninformation, services, and knowledge required to carry out successful cyber-attacks,\nparticularly within the cybercrime financial ecosystem.\n\nWe’ve uncovered the real identity of a threat actor dubbed SaNX – a handle that has\nbecome an infamous one among many security departments of numerous leading\ncorporations worldwide. Here, we’ll also reveal his activities, other handles in the Darknet,\nand affiliations to other hacking groups.\n\n## A Creative Bypass for Account Validation\n\nSaNX’s line of services allows fraud actors to check whether a given set of stolen credentials\nare valid for popular banking, e-commerce and retail mobile apps.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Post by SaNX where he advertises his service, “API allows verification of the validity of the login details for_\n_a website. As to the possible exploits of the API, it’s not my business”_\n\nWhile the service itself isn’t new nor novel, the direction of SaNX’s approach is interesting;\nhe abuses possible flaws in the APIs used by mobile applications associated with the\nservices, thus bypassing traditional security mechanisms used by companies. The\ncapabilities supplied by these services are very useful to fraud actors and others who deal in\naccount takeovers (ATO) for a variety of purposes.\n\n_A list of the world’s top financial organizations and mega-retailers, all targeted by SaNX. The list includes_\n_some of the major online retailers and banks across the United States, such as Walmart, Capital One,_\n_Bank of America, TD Bank, and more._\n\n## AI’s Aid in Credential Stuffing\n\n\n-----\n\nTo best understand why SaNX s products are so lucrative, let s quickly review a generic\nscenario for how threat actors perform accounts takeovers by leveraging third-party data\nbreaches.\n\nFraud actors commonly attack financial institutions, retailers and other consumer-facing\n[businesses by taking over accounts via credential stuffing. To perform such a strike, the](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Credential_stuffing)\nattacker needs only three elements:\n\n**1. Targets – The cybercrime financial underground is chock-full of tutorials and walkthroughs**\non fraudulent cashing out of “cracked” e-commerce, retail and even gaming accounts.\n\n**2. Credentials – A known commodity in the criminal underground, as multiple vendors**\nspecialize in breaching internet-facing databases and selling their content to other criminals.\nThis usually comprises usernames, emails and passwords that can later be re-used against\npopular targets.\n\n**3. Automation, however, is key in the credential stuffing process. Since attackers usually**\nemploy a spray-and-pray approach, more credentials equal a higher success rate. Tools that\nautomate the checks of credentials against a target website are widespread in low-level\ncarding and cracking communities. They come in a variety of flavors – from SaaS services\noperated by cybercriminals to simple “checkers” desktop clients – with a few tools, such as\n[Sentry MBA, achieving well-earned notoriety and having dedicated communities in the](https://www.shapesecurity.com/reports/sentry-mba)\ncriminal underground.\n\n\n-----\n\n_A generic, “all in one” checker offered on a cracking forum_\n\nAs credential stuffing tools grew ubiquitous in the criminal underground, most organizations\nimplemented anti-fraud mechanisms to thwart “checking” attempts from low-level tools. This\nis where SaNX enters the equation. Most checkers target web applications via imitating\nbrowsers, and as such are susceptible to being intercepted by fraud prevention. SaNX’s\napproach tackles the mobile API – thus allegedly bypassing the standard.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The general process of account takeovers. Threat actors can choose a traditional checker for credential_\n_stuffing, or alternatively go through SaNX’s services that imitate a mobile application’s API, and likely_\n_bypasses fraud prevention mechanisms._\n\nSaNX’s services pose fraud threats to organizations’ security as they expose them to brute\nforce or credential stuffing attacks by leveraging what appears to be a security blind spot.\nEven though offering relatively sophisticated services, it’s important to note that SaNX is\nsimply another link to the chain of services offered in the cybercrime financial ecosystem;\nacquiring the “private APIs” isn’t a magic bullet that attackers can use against an\norganization. Unlike simple checkers, SaNX puts most of his effort into the API itself and not\nnecessarily on mass scale and automation, requiring his clients to integrate the tools into a\nwider credential stuffing framework.\n\n## The Proof is in the Pudding\n\nThe key to a business’s growth and success is to execute it in a way that will attract and\nsatisfy customers. As Darknet businesses evolve towards more “professional” business\nmodels and practices, attracting new customers is dependent on the level of innovation and\nnovelty of the idea. Long-term success, however, is particularly dependent on customer\nsatisfaction. To determine SaNX’s credibility as a seller in the Darknet, we decided to assess\nhis buyers’ reviews. Numerous posts indicated that SaNX maintains a high level of credibility\nand is considered to be a particularly professional threat actor (see below).\n\n\n-----\n\n_User in a Russian-speaking underground forum says about SaNX’s services: “We bought API; everything_\n_went well” (March 5, 2018)_\n\n_From Russian: “Very professional and accurate seller. I’ve gotten a good impression of working with him”_\n_(May 22, 2019)_\n\nThese relatively recent reviews confirm SaNX’s ongoing efforts and successes, which only\nmotivated our researchers to dig further and identify this harmful threat actor by name and\nany other PII that could help track him down.\n\n## Lifting the (Limited) Anonymity Cloak of the Darknet\n\nMaintaining anonymity has become a difficult challenge in the Darknet with the growth of\ndigitalization. Hackers will almost inevitably leave traces of their activities, enabling threat\nresearchers to perform research to identify them.\n\nWe began by finding a post signed by SaNX in a FidoNet thread where we were already able\nto assert his connection to the hacking group, Russian Ebola Virus Crew (“EVC”), along with\nhis full name and email address.\n\n\n-----\n\n_This was a post found as a part of an in-depth research performed when looking for posts by SaNX. Here,_\n_SaNX was seen signing his name (Alexander Korostin) and EVC connection on a post from 2003 within a_\n_FidoNet thread. This research was done using KELA’s proprietary tool,_ _[DARKBEAST, which enables](https://ke-la.com/our-solutions/)_\n_users to search through years of historical Darknet data stored in KELA’s data lake._\n\nWe then found further affirmations of the connection between EVC and SaNX, when various\nstatements by EVC were found declaring SaNX as one of its members.\n\n\n-----\n\n_SaNX being listed as a member of the Russian Ebola Virus Crew (EVC) hacking team._\n\nBy using his name and affiliation to EVC as a basis to search other handles used by SaNX,\nwe were led to more of his PII. We later noticed that SaNX began using a new name, which\nwas simply a combination of his full name and affiliation to EVC, “Alkorevc”:\nAl(exandr)kor(ostin)evc.\n\nEnough proof was pointing to the fact that SaNX was indeed Alexander Korostin and that he\nwas affiliated to EVC, but there was more information out there related to SaNX. We started\nbrowsing through various websites and we were eventually directed towards a local\ncommunity website, Izhevsk.ru, where “SaNXeVC” was seen responding to one of the posts\non a transportation-related thread in Sokolovka, a locality in the Sarapul District of the\nUdmurtiya Republic in Russia. Taking note of this location, we continued our search to see if\nit could be confirmed.\n\nLooking at SaNX’s social media pages, we found a YouTube channel registered as\n“SaNX498” by the name “Aleksandr Alekseyevich” with video uploads from the Udmurtiya\nRepublic, but it didn’t stop there. Just like your everyday internet user would link their social\nmedia accounts for convenience, SaNX’s linked his YouTube page to an Instagram profile\nbearing the name “sanxevc”, which he recently changed to “sanxsanxsanx”. His Instagram\nshowed photos of Aleksandr from Sigayevo, Sarapul District, Udmurtiya Republic,\nreconnecting us to the original location that we detected earlier.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Pictures taken from SaNX’s Instagram profile, showing his location_\n\nOne final search helped us confirm our findings. By searching the name “Aleksandr Korostin”\nin Russian (Александр Коростин) we were exposed to his profile in a local job-hunting\nboard. We were given access to view his resume uncovering more information on his\neducational and occupational background, his date of birth (December 10, 1982), and a\nheadshot.\n\nAll of these dots allowed us to finalize and close the priorly ambiguous case. So here we had\nit, SaNX or rather, 36-year-old, Aleksandr Alekseyevich Korostin (Александр Алексеевич\nКоростин) from Sigayevo, Sarapul District, Udmurtiya Republic, Russia, is no longer\nanonymous.\n\n## Takeaways and Lessons Learned\n\nAPIs are an imperative part of digitized organizations today, allowing mobile apps or\nwebsites to communicate more effectively, and ultimately make clients’ lives easier and more\nconvenient. More flexibility for users, however, can exponentially increase the attack surface\nfor bad actors. Organizations must continue to monitor for newer and more sophisticated\n\n\n-----\n\nthreats that will continue to emerge with technological advancements. While we can t take\ndown every threat actor operating in the Darknet, we can certainly deter attacks and mitigate\nthreats that are targeting large organizations.\n\n_[Ask our team what your organization can do today to detect sophisticated threats against](https://ke-la.com/contact-us/)_\n_your organization before a potential cyberattack happens._\n\n\n-----",
