The NetWalker ransomware syndicate is no\nexception to this trend. NetWalker responsible for such attacks as a high-profile ransom of\nthe Australian transportation and logistics company Toll Group was first spotted in August of\n2019. When it was discovered the group and the ransomware it used were originally referred\nby researchers as “MailTo.” However, it is the threat actor’s recent activity–not its origins–that\nhas earned it recognition from the US Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the\ncyber community at large.\n\nWithin the past two months, NetWalker has become extremely active; the syndicate has\nrevolutionized the way it conducts business by transitioning to a network intrusion-focused,\nRansomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model. This new business model allows NetWalker to\ncollaborate with other seasoned cybercriminals who already have access to large networks\nand have the ability to disseminate ransomware.\n\nNetWalker distributes ransomware via two main methods: 1) phishing schemes & spam\nemails; and 2) large-scale network infiltration. NetWalker now claims a singular preference\nfor network infiltration, which is novel to the Russian-speaking ransomware community. As a\nresult, the threat actor is requiring its new affiliates to have pre-existing access to large\nnetworks.\n\nOnce deployed, NetWalker ransomware quickly encrypts the user’s files and presents the\nvictim with this ransom note:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image 1: NetWalker ransom note (source: PC Risk)_\n\nIn addition to increasing its manpower and expanding its capabilities, NetWalker has been\nactively taking advantage of the COVID-19 crisis. The threat actor’s phishing emails have\ncontained an attachment titled “CORONAVIRUS_COVID-19.vbs,” which targets people who\nare interested in learning more about the crisis, as well as individuals and entities involved in\nthe healthcare industry. NetWalker poses a significant threat, as it has been carrying out\nthese high-profile attacks while simultaneously posting on the top-tier Russian-language\nDarkWeb forums in order to expand its operations and capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Assessment and Findings**\n\nOn March 19, 2020, NetWalker representatives on forums began to propagate the\nannouncement of the ransomware affiliate program. The phrasing and the context of these\nas well as further announcements shed light on the internal workings of this group. Notably,\nthe Representative expressed a preference for affiliates “who prioritize quality, not quantity.”\nThe threat actor’s preference for quality stands in stark contrast to other Russian-speaking\nactors’ ransomware operations, which often focus instead on mass production and brute\nforce attacks. In addition, the NetWalker team offered the following victim-focused material\nas incentives for potential affiliates: IP addresses, access to domain administrator accounts,\nnetwork-attached storage (NAS) access, organization name, and organization revenue.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image 2: NetWalker centers their operations around network compromise. The group_\n_references access to corporate networks as “materiel” and explains in detail how exactly the_\n_skill and knowledge of network intrusion will fit into their operations._\n\nA month after the RaaS program was advertised, on April 19, 2020, NetWalker clarified its\naffiliate requirements, claiming interest only in experienced, Russian-speaking network\nintruders–not spammers–with a preference for immediate, consistent work. Traditionally,\ncybercrime organizations have used tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) such as\nmass phishing campaigns to gain control over targeted networks, which has oftentimes\ncreated an opportunity for amateur hackers to get involved. However, as the group has\ncontinuously outlined in their posts, NetWalker is behaving differently. The collective is\nselectively choosing the affiliates it collaborates with, creating an exclusive group of top-tier\nnetwork intruders to execute its new RaaS business model.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image 3: NetWalker follows the trends established by REvil across the Russian-speaking_\n_cybercrime community - to pursue highest standards and rigid requirements for the RaaS_\n_candidates_\n\nAccording to AdvIntel’s sensitive source intelligence, after a potential candidate passes the\nreview by group members, they receive the following note, detailing NetWalker’s operational\ncode for affiliates.\n\n_Image 4: Translation from Russian - segments in brackets refer to the translator’s comments_\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat is especially noteworthy is NetWalker’s guarantee of providing decryption to the victims\nwhen the ransom is paid. Additionally, the group’s percentage share - 20% to 80% (with 20%\nfor the NetWalker and 80% for the affiliate) can be considered very generous. To compare,\nGandCrab offered 30/70 or even 40/60 shares.\n\n_[Image 5: NetWalker ransomware includes a modular configuration setting.](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1225086186445733889)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image 6: NetWalker ransomware includes a detailed configuration._\n\nOn May 10th, the group posted another request for affiliates, this time asking specifically for\n“experienced networkers with their own material.” The Representative claims that the\nransomware “works on all Windows” operating systems from Windows 2000 onwards; the\nactor also claims that NetWalker not only encrypts network assets using a customizable,\nmulti-threaded locker but also maps the breached networks, including resources such as\n\n\n-----\n\nNAS. As for the architecture of the ransomware itself, the Representative has explained that\n“the locker is located inside a [PowerShell] script,” which circumvents the need to upload the\npayload to an external network. NetWalker claims that this feature helps “deal” with antivirus\nproducts, including Windows Defender.\n\n**Exfiltrating Corporate Data**\n\nNotably, the NetWalker claims the ability to exfiltrate data and publish it to a “blog.” This is a\nsignificant assertion, given both the credibility of the threat actor and the consequences this\naction could pose to entities that possess confidential or sensitive information. The group’s\nrepresentative has backed up its claim with links to the aforementioned blog. They also\nbolstered its credibility with screenshots of payouts it has received from its extortion efforts.\n\n_Image 7: Besides the description of the locker’s capabilities, this post provides valuable_\n_insights on how the network compromise processing is integrated into the workflow of the_\n_ransomware operations_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image 8: Screenshots offered by NetWalker illustrate the scale of their operations_\n\n\n-----\n\nOn May 13th, the Representative posted another update with references to targeted entities;\nmost importantly, the post also included a link to the blog in which those entities’ data have\nbeen exfiltrated to.\n\n_Image 9: Judging from the existence of this blog, the actor’s threat to exfiltrate and publish_\n_victims’ data appears highly credible._\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNot only is NetWalker actively expanding its operations, but the group is also changing the\nway ransomware is deployed. The group’s activities on top-tier DarkWeb forums also provide\na unique insight into the current workings of the ransomware ecosystem. Traditionally,\nRussian-speaking ransomware groups have focused on the mass production of phishing\nemails and spam. Over the past two months, however, NetWalker has detailed its ideal\naffiliates: experienced network intruders, specifically those who speak Russian. This\ntransition to network intrusion as the main method of ransomware dissemination is a novel\nconcept within the Russian-speaking ransomware community.\n\nOver the past two months, NetWalker has proven its legitimacy through notorious attacks\nand the ability to provide unique, victim-focused material to its affiliates. The syndicate has\nalso proven willing and able to exfiltrate victims’ data to a DarkWeb blog. In addition, the size\nof the ransom payments it has posted is significant, ranging from hundreds of thousands to\nmillions of dollars. Netwalker is a rapidly evolving, credible actor that poses a significant\nthreat, especially to the healthcare industry during the COVID-19 crisis. It is likely that there\nwill be more updates from, and attacks by, NetWalker in the weeks and months to come.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Yara Signature: NetWalker Ransomware**\n\nrule crime_win32_netwalker_1 {\n\nmeta:\n\ndescription = \"Detects Netwalker Ransomware Variant\"\n\nauthor = \"@VK_Intel\"\n\nreference = \"https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1240767289793929217\"\n\ndate = \"2020-03-19\"\n\nstrings:\n\n$str1 = \"unlock\"\n\n$str2 = \"spsz\"\n\n$str3 = \"onion\"\n\n$start_code = {e8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 c0 74 ?? e8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 c0 74 ?? e8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 c0\n74 ?? e8 ?? ?? ?? ?? e8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 6a 01 8b ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ff d0 6a 01 ff ?? ?? ?? ?? ??\n33 c0 c2 10 00}\n\ncondition:\n\n( uint16(0) == 0x5a4d and\n\n( 3 of them )\n\n) or ( all of them )\n\n}\n\n\n-----\n\n_Advanced Intelligence, LLC, thanks Bridgit Sullivan and Daniel Frey for contributing to this_\n_investigation._\n\n\n-----",
