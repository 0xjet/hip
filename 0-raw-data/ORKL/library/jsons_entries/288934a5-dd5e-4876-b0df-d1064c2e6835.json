Overview\n\nOperation Sphinx is a cyber-espionage activity in the Middle East. The main victims are political\nand military organizations in Egypt, Israel and possibly other countries. Sensitive data theft is\nwhat the attackers plotted for during the period from June, 2014 to November, 2015 when the\nactivity was in its prime. We encountered some timestamps of the samples to be as early as\nDecember, 2011 which suggests the attack might be started much earlier, though further sound\nproof is needed. The main approach of Sphinx is watering hole attack on social websites. Until\nnow, we have obtained 314 pieces of sample malicious codes and 7 C2 domains.\n\nA common method attackers use to hide their trace is to cloak malicious exe files with Word or\nPDF icons so that users will not tell the difference without looking into the file attribution or\nproperty. The Sphinx attackers adopt it as well, but they also attempt to conceal the attacks by\nmaking the master program “invisible”. In our analysis, Sphinx’ master program was found to be\ndisguised with Word icon in order to trap users to click. Upon clicking, the master program\nreleased several DLL files. The files can be categorized into 9 types of plugin modules by\nfunctionality. The core DLL fill could be self-started after registering as a plugin of the resource\nmanagement panel. Then, based on different configurations, remote injection was triggered to\ninject other functional DLL to corresponding running process. This way, when the malware was\nrunning, the master program had already been split into several imperceptible pieces. That\ndecreases the risk for the targets to realize the existence of the malware. Multiple encryption\nalgorithms were adopted simultaneously to hamper the detection.\n\nSeeing from the PDB paths, we suspect that the attackers were using continuous integration tools,\nwhich indicts that the scale of operation may massive and the developers of the malware are\nprofessionals in relevant fields. Furthermore, we speculate that some third party organizations\nwere involved in helping develop the malware to support the Middle East’s attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n# 2. Payload Delivery \n\n### 1) Watering Holes on Social Websites \n\nOne of the lure documents was found in the comments area on Israeli Army’s Facebook. It shows\nthe attackers took advantage of this social websites to deliver the payload because their targets\noften visit it. This is the watering hole that has been seen as compromise vector in many\ncyber-attacks. Traditionally, watering holes attacks can be categorized into two types by\napproach:\n\na. Attackers will usually study and capture the website that their targets often visit. Then\n\nmalware code (usually the scripts exploit some vulnerability) is directly embedded on the\nsite. Now, the site is infected with Trojan and the trap is ready for victims. When the\ntargets visit the site and click infected pages, the malware will be implanted in their\ncomputer if the network environment matches attackers preset conditions.\n\nb. Attackers will capture a website and replace certain application or link on it with\n\nmalicious download link. Once target visits the site and download the file in the link,\nmalware will be implanted in the victim’s computer. Typical cases are the Havex Trojan[1]\n(also known as Dragonfly or Energetic Bear) unrevealed in 2014 and OceanLotus in late\nMay, 2015[2].\n\nThe commonness the two approaches share is attackers need to obtain the authorization to\nmodify the website they aim to capture. However, in Sphinx attacks, it is much easier to get\nauthorized to deploy the watering holes because they just need to simply register a Facebook\naccount. That is all they need to be free to scatter malicious links in the comments’ area. It is a\nnew approach in setting up watering holes in APT attacks.\n\n1 Havex Hunts For ICS/SCADA Systems, [https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002718.html](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002718.html)\n2 APT Group OceanLotus, [https://ti.360.com/upload/report/file/OceanLotusReport.pdf](https://ti.360.com/upload/report/file/OceanLotusReport.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 1 Location of the samples on Facebook\n\nThe table below shows detailed download link and MD5 of the RAR file from the link:\n\n**Malicious Download Link** **hxxp://israelleaks.is-a-chef.com/leaks/isleaks.rar**\n\n**Status of the Domain** Invalid, already been marked as “sinkhole” by security vendors\n\n**MD5 of the Downloaded RAR File** 1e4ed1704e31917f8652aa0078a85459\n\nLure documents in the RAR file are about the amendment on individual income tax regulations.\nThe original exe icon has been replaced with a PDF or Word icon to induce targets to click.\n\nPicture 2 Lure documents in RAR file folder\n\nWith in-depth analysis, we found that 10 social website accounts in total were compromised in\nthe attacks, including Israeli Army, Israeli Navy and other accounts related with Israeli military\nand government. Malicious comments are intense from late January to early February in 2015.\nThe content containing a malicious link are mostly about the aforementioned adjustments of\nindividual income tax.\n\n*Please review Appendix A for a whole list of the sites.\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 3 C2 domain took over by Kaspersky using sinkhole technique\n\n### 2) Lure Documents\n\nThere are two types lure documents and the contents can tell APT researchers what fields and\ngeos the attackers were targeting.\n\n**(A)** **Egypt - Arabic**\n\nPicture 4 Lure documents – 1\n\nIn the original lure document[3], the YouTube video links showing the arrests of students from\nAl-Azhar University that against the coup are included at the end of the file.\n\n3 hxxps://docs.google.com/file/d/0ByavzARTLomhc3hFeFhGN1JOOE0/edit?pli=1\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 5 Lure Document – 2\n\nThe name “annonymous rabaa” on the picture is an Egyptian hacker group that compromise\ngovernment official sites to protest the slaughter in August, 2013.\n\n**(B)** **Israel - Hebrew**\n\nPicture 6 Lure document – 3\n\nThis document quotes the adjustments of Israeli individual income tax.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 3) Self-camouflage \n\nThe malware either cloak itself with documentation and image icon, or with application icon. The\npicture below shows a fake Adobe Flash installer file.\n\nPicture 7 Impersonation of a document\n\nPicture 8 Impersonation of an Adobe Flash application\n\nWith the former approach, no document or image will pop-up upon clicking; while with the latter\napproach, the legitimate installer file will be released after the malware finishes its installation.\n\nThe 9 plugin modules are disguised as Office components. In earlier version of the malware, the\ninstallation directory is %UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\officeplugin. But later versions\nchanged the path to be under C:\\Program Files\\{GUID}, for instance, C:\\Program\nFiles\\{59f0641e-45ac-11e5-af9e-b8ca3af5855f} is a piece of malware that pretends to be a\nsystem component.\n\nPicture 9 File Property of the Malware\n\n\n-----\n\n# 3. Malware Analysis - ROCK\n\n### 1) Functionality Brief\n\nROCK Trojan plays a main role in the Sphinx attacks. This malware family was developed by the\nattackers themselves or was customer-made by a third party group. We also found a variant of\nthe njRAT family in another sample which we will introduce in another chapter.\n\nThe malware impersonated Word documents, images or installation programs in the attempt to\ndisguise itself as PDF files, pictures or Flash installers to induce the users to click.\n\nThe main purpose is to steal sensitive information from the victims, such as system information,\naccount & password and search history saved in the browser. It also monitors victims through\nSkype chatting history, cameras, microphones and keyboard & mouse logging. The information\ncollected will then be encrypted and passed back to specific C2 servers.\n\n### 2) Infrastructure\n\nPicture 10 Infrastructure of the malware\n\nConfiguration data of all the modules is saved in JSON configuration file. The file decides, to name\na few, whether to run the module or not, what encryption key to use on the data files, what\npixels and intervals of the screenshots and audio recordings are required, as well we what\nrunning process the master program should be injected in. It also provides the user ID (rkuid),\ndue date, C2 address, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 11 Modules and Functionalities\n\nThe dropper releases 20 DLL files in total with ten 32-bit and ten 64-bit. Each module is\ncomposed of two versions to be compliant with 32-bit and 64-bit system.\n\n**Module name** **Functionality**\n\n**zcore** Master program\n\n**zulib** API function encapsulation\n\n**plgcmd** Obtain system info, screenshots, startup/end progress\n\n**plgcomm** Communication\n\n**plginput** Mouse and keyboard logging\n\n**plgurl** Monitor the content in web browser’s (IE, FireFox, Chrome) address bar\n\n**plgskype** Save and pass back Skype chatting history, screenshots and audio records\n\n**plgavbug** Monitor through camera and microphone, send back the records\n\n**plgusrstl** Steal user information, including account name & password, search history,\n\ncookies, Pidgin (IM software) account\n\n**plgfsflt** Monitor and pass back data of specific file types like doc, docx, ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx,\n\nodf, txt, pdf, rtf, jpg, jpeg, gif, png\n\nWhen the master program Zcore is started, it decrypts the configuration file under installation\ndirectory and decides whether to inject into certain process according to the module status\n(true/false) in the configuration file.\n\n**Function modules:**\n Zcore.dll core module: mainly responsible for loading other function modules and\ninjecting them to certain process; register, update and uninstall modules, distribute logs\nand messages\n Plgcmd.dll command module: obtain system information, delete file and directory, take\nscreenshots, upload saved documents, start and end process.\n Plgcomm.dll communication module: transfer data generated and encrypted by other\nmodules to specific C2 server. The module sends a request to the server per minute to\n\n\n-----\n\nacquire remote commands.\n\nThe cross-process communication between each module is completed via WM_COPYDATA\nmessages. Every message begins with 0x34AB541 which is the unique identification. The body of\nthe message is transferred in JSON codes.\n\n### 3) C2 Communication\n\nThe message is transferred in data package to server port 80 through HTTP POST. Sensitive strings\nin the package are replaced after querying the mapping table of JSON configuration file.\n\nPicture 1 C2 Communication\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 13 Restored Strings of C2 Communication\n\nC2 communication modules is injected into the browser process and the port used to send data\nto C2 server is port 80, these two methods perfectly cloak the attack among the normal traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 4) Attack Techniques \n\n**Random file names**\nThe module files are re-named randomly after being released by the Dropper and the names are\nstored in the JSON file (usually nouns in English, for instance, gendarme.dll, jerques.dll).\n\nPicture 14 File name of the modules\n\n**String Encryption**\nAll the strings are encrypted by several encryption algorithms.\n\nPicture 15 String Encryption\n\n**API function encapsulation**\nA great amount of API functions (over 300) are encapsulated in zulib (a dynamic dll library) to\nhamper static analysis from security software.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Runtime without master program**\nThe core module is started up as an extension of explorer.exe. Other modules are injected into\ncertain processes according to the configuration file. Therefore, there is no master program\nrunning during the malware runtime which makes the malicious activities hard to be noticed.\nEven though sometimes users may sense the abnormity, they would still relax their vigilance at\nlast with checking attempt ending up in vain.\n\n**Process injection**\nThe master module runs in a legitimate explorer which security software will not intercept.\nCommunication module is usually injected into the browser process. But if there is no browser\nprocess, the malware will give up communicating with C2 server. The data theft module is\ninjected into security software so as to make the malware’s trace inconspicuous when it traverses\nfiles.\n\n**PE and config file encryption**\nPE files in the dropper are compressed by zlib and encrypted by AES algorithms, as well as the\nconfiguration files released by the dropper.\nNo matter on dynamic or static combat, the attack tactics indicts that these malware developers\nmust have spent time and efforts studying security software to compile customer-made malware\nso as to avoid detection and cover its trace.\n\n# 4.
