Soon after that, on March 15, we found one\nof the modules enabling a dangerous attack – spoofing URLs loaded in the browser.\n\nThe malicious module consists of several parts and is detected by Kaspersky Lab products\nas Backdoor.AndroidOS.Triada.p/o/q. When it gains superuser privileges, it uses regular\nLinux debugging tools to embed its DLL (Triada.q, which then loads Triada.o) into the\nprocesses of the following browsers:\n\n**com.android.browser (the standard Android browser)**\n**com.qihoo.browser (360 Secure Browser)**\n**com.ijinshan.browser_fast (Cheetah browser)**\n**com.oupeng.browser (Oupeng browser)**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DLL intercepts the URL the user is opening, analyzes it and, if necessary, changes it to\nanother URL. The rules for changing the URL are downloaded from the C&C server while the\nmodule is running.\n\n## Attack sequence\n\nIn an uninfected system, the browser sends a request with a URL address to the web server\nvia the Internet, and receives a page in response.\n\nAfter infection by Triada, a DLL intercepting URLs is added to the browser’s process. The\nURL address request finds its way into this DLL, where it is modified and sent to another web\nserver.\n\nAs a result, the browser receives data that’s different from that requested, meaning the user\nends up viewing a different page.\n\nNow, this sequence of actions is being used by malware creators to change the standard\nsearch engine selected in the user’s browser, and to replace the home page. Essentially,\nthese actions are identical to those carried out by numerous adware programs for Windows.\nHowever, there is nothing to stop similar attacks intercepting any URL, including banking\nURLs, and redirecting users to phishing pages, etc. All it takes is for the cybercriminals to\nsend the appropriate command.\n\nDuring our observation period, this module attacked 247 users, and there have been no\nsigns of a decrease in the intensity of attacks. The number of module versions is small; it\nappears the creators of this backdoor have decided to focus their efforts elsewhere, in spite\n\n\n-----\n\nof all the promise shown by this technology.\n\n[The geography distribution is very similar to that of root-access malware, as this module can](https://securelist.com/blog/mobile/71981/taking-root/)\nonly function together with Triada, and is downloaded by Triada.\n\n_Number of users attacked by Backdoor.AndroidOS.Triada.p in different countries_\n\nIn conclusion, we would like to note that cybercriminals specializing in Android are pretty lazy\n– it’s easier for them to steal money directly, for instance, with the help of Trojans that send\ntext messages to premium-rate numbers, or spoof banking app windows. However, we have\nrecently observed that some cybercriminals have begun to actively study the structure of the\noperating system, expand their repertoire of technical skills, and launch sophisticated attacks\nlike the one we examined above.\n\n[Google Android](https://securelist.com/tag/google-android/)\n[Mobile browser](https://securelist.com/tag/mobile-browser/)\n[Rooting Trojan](https://securelist.com/tag/rooting-trojan/)\n[spoofing](https://securelist.com/tag/spoofing/)\n[Trojan](https://securelist.com/tag/trojan/)\n\nAuthors\n\n\n-----\n\nAnton Kivva\n\nEveryone sees not what they want to see\n\nYour email address will not be published.
