There are multiple reasons why this campaign is\nextraordinary in its execution and logistics. It all started one day when we encountered a\nsomewhat unsophisticated spy program that communicated with its “master” via a public email server. This approach is rather inherent to many amateur virus-writers and these\nmalware attacks are mostly ignored.\n\nHowever, there were a few things that attracted our attention:\n\nThe public e-mail server in question was Bulgarian – mail.bg.\nThe compilation path string contained Korean hieroglyphs.\n\nThese two facts compelled us take a closer look at this malware — Korean compilers\nalongside Bulgarian e-mail command-and-control communications.\n\nThe complete path found in the malware presents some Korean strings:\n\nD:rsh공격UAC_dll(완성)Releasetest.pdb\n\nThe “rsh” word, by all appearances, means a shortening of “Remote Shell” and the Korean\nwords can be translated in English as “attack” and “completion”, i.e.:\n\n\n-----\n\nD:rshATTACKUAC_dll(COMPLETION)Releasetest.pdb\n\nAlthough the full list of victims remains unknown, we managed to identify several targets of\nthis campaign. According to our technical analysis, the attackers were interested in targeting\nfollowing organizations”.\n\nThe Sejong Institute\n\n_The Sejong Institute is a non-profit private organization for public interest and a leading think_\n_tank in South Korea, conducting research on national security strategy, unification strategy,_\n_regional issues, and international political economy._\n\nKorea Institute For Defense Analyses (KIDA)\n\n_KIDA is a comprehensive defense research institution that covers a wide range of defense-_\n_related issues. KIDA is organized into seven research centers: the Center for Security and_\n_Strategy; the Center for Military Planning; the Center for Human Resource Development; the_\n_Center for Resource Management; the Center for Weapon Systems Studies; the Center for_\n_Information System Studies; and the Center for Modeling and Simulation. KIDA also has an_\n_IT Consulting Group and various supporting departments. KIDA’s mission is to contribute to_\n_rational defense policy-making through intensive and systematic research and analysis of_\n_defense issues._\n\nMinistry of Unification\n\n_The Ministry of Unification is an executive department of the South Korean government_\n_responsible for working towards the reunification of Korea. Its major duties are: establishing_\n_North Korea Policy, coordinating inter-Korean dialogue, pursuing inter-Korean cooperation_\n_and educating the public on unification._\n\nHyundai Merchant Marine\n\n_Hyundai Merchant Marine is a South Korean logistics company providing worldwide_\n_container shipping services._\n\nSome clues also suggest that computers belonging to “The supporters of Korean Unification”\n(http://www.unihope.kr/) were also targeted. Among the organizations we counted, 11 are\nbased in South Korea and two entities reside in China.\n\nPartly because this campaign is very limited and highly targeted, we have not yet been able\nto identify how this malware is being distributed. The malicious samples we found are the\nearly stage malware most often delivered by spear-phishing e-mails.\n\n## Infecting a system\n\n\n-----\n\nThe initial Trojan dropper is a Dynamic Link Library functioning as a loader for further\nmalware. It does not maintain exports and simply delivers another encrypted library\nmaintained in its resource section. This second library performs all the espionage\nfunctionality.\n\nWhen running on Windows 7, the malicious library uses the Metasploit Framework’s opensource code Win7Elevate to inject malicious code into explorer.exe. In any case, be it\nWindows 7 or not, this malicious code decrypts its spying library from resources, saves it to\ndisk with an apparently random but hardcoded name, for example,\n_~DFE8B437DD7C417A6D.TMP, in the user’s temporary folder and loads this file as library._\n\nThis next stage library copies itself into the System32 directory of the Windows folder after\nthe hardcoded file name — either KBDLV2.DLL or AUTO.DLL, depending on the malware\nsample. Then the service is created for the service dll. Service names also can differ from\nversion to version; we discovered the following names — DriverManage, WebService and\n_WebClientManager. These functions assure malware persistence in a compromised OS_\nbetween system reboots.\n\nAt this stage, the malware gathers information about the infected computer. This includes an\noutput of the systeminfo command saved in the file oledvbs.inc by following the hardcoded\npath: C:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBoledvbs.inc. There is another function\ncalled – the malware creates a string containing computer and user names but this isn’t used\nanywhere. By all appearances, this is a mistake by the malware author. Later on, we will\ncome to a function where such a string could be pertinent but the malware is not able to find\nthis data in the place where it should be. These steps are taken only if it’s running on an\ninfected system for the first time. At system startup, the malicious library performs spying\nactivities when it confirms that it is loaded by the generic svchost.exe process.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Spying modules\n\nThere are a lot of malicious programs involved in this campaign but, strangely, they each\nimplement a single spying function. Besides the basic library (KBDLV2.DLL / AUTO.DLL) that\nis responsible for common communication with its campaign master, we were able to find\nmodules performing the following functions:\n\nKeystroke logging\nDirectory listing collection\nHWP document theft\nRemote control download and execution\nRemote control access\n\n## Disabling firewall\n\nAt system startup, the basic library disables the system firewall and any AhnLab firewall (a\nSouth Korean security product vendor) by zeroing out related values in registry:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n\nSYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesSharedAccessParameters\n\nFirewallPolicyStandardProfile\n\nEnableFirewall = 0\n\nSYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesSharedAccessParameters\n\nFirewallPolicyPublicProfile\n\nEnableFirewall = 0\n\nHKLMSOFTWAREAhnLabV3IS2007InternetSec\n\nFWRunMode = 0\n\nHKLMSOFTWAREAhnlabV3IS80is\n\nfwmode = 0\n\n\nIt also turns off the Windows Security Center service to prevent alerting the user about the\ndisabled firewall.\n\nIt is not accidental that the malware author has singled out AhnLab’s security product. During\nour [Winnti research, we learnt that one of the Korean victims was severely criticized by](https://securelist.com/winnti-more-than-just-a-game/37029/)\nSouth Korean regulators for using foreign security products. We do not know for sure how\nthis criticism affected other South Korean organizations, but we do know that many South\nKorean organizations install AhnLab security products. Accordingly, these attackers don’t\neven bother evading foreign vendors’ products, because their targets are solely South\nKorean.\n\nOnce the malware disables the AhnLab firewall, it checks whether the file taskmgr.exe is\nlocated in the hardcoded C:WINDOWS folder. If the file is present, it runs this executable.\nNext, the malware loops every 30 minutes to report itself and wait for response from its\noperator.\n\n## Communications\n\nCommunication between bot and operator flows through the Bulgarian web-based free email\nserver (mail.bg). The bot maintains hardcoded credentials for its e-mail account. After\nauthenticating, the malware sends e-mails to another specified e-mail address, and reads emails from the inbox. All these activities are performed via the “mail.bg” web-interface with\nthe use of the system Wininet API functions. From all the samples that we managed to\nobtain, we extracted the following email accounts used in this campaign:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n\nbeautifl@mail.bg\n\nennemyman@mail.bg\n\nfasionman@mail.bg\n\nhappylove@mail.bg\n\nlovest000@mail.bg\n\nmonneyman@mail.bg\n\nsportsman@mail.bg\n\nveryhappy@mail.bg\n\n\nHere are the two “master” email addresses to which the bots send e-mails on behalf of the\nabove-mentioned accounts. They report on status and transmit infected system information\nvia attachments:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\niop110112@hotmail.com\n\nrsh1213@hotmail.com\n\n\n## Regular reporting\n\nTo report infection status, the malware reads from C:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle\n_DBoledvbs.inc which contains the systeminfo command output. If the file exists, it is deleted_\nafter reading.\n\nThen, it reads user-related info from the file sqlxmlx.inc in the same folder (we can see\nstrings referencing to “UserID” commentary in this part of the code). But this file was never\ncreated. As you recall, there is a function that should have collected this data and should\nhave saved it into this sqlxmlx.inc file. However, on the first launch, the collected user\ninformation is saved into “xmlrwbin.inc”. This effectively means that the malware writer\nmistakenly coded the bot to save user information into the wrong file. There is a chance for\nthe mistaken code to still work — user information could be copied into the send information\nheap. But not in this case – at the time of writing, the gathered user information variable\nwhich should point to the xmlrwbin.inc filename has not yet been initialized, causing the file\nwrite to fail. We see that sqlxmlx.inc is not created to store user information.\n\nNext, the intercepted keystrokes are read from the file and sent to the master. Keystrokes\nare logged and kept in an ordinary and consistent format in this file – both the names of\nwindows in which keys were typed and the actual sequence of keyboard entry. This data is\n\n\n-----\n\nfound in the file C:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBmsolui80.inc created by the\nexternal key logger module.\n\nAll this data is merged in one file xmlrwbin.inc, which is then encrypted with RC4. The RC4\nkey is generated as an MD5 hash of a randomly generated 117-bytes buffer. To be able to\ndecipher the data, the attacker should certainly know either the MD5 hash or the whole\nbuffer content. This data is also sent, but RSA encrypted. The malware constructs a 1120 bit\npublic key, uses it to encrypt the 117-bytes buffer. The malware then concatenates all the\ndata to be sent as a 128-bytes block. The resulting data is saved in C:Program\n_FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DB to a file named according to the following format:_\n\n“<system time>_<account at Bulgarian email server>.txt”, for example,\n“08191757_beautifl@mail.bg.txt”.\n\nThe file is then attached to an e-mail and sent to the master’s e-mail account. Following\ntransmission, it is immediately deleted from the victim system.\n\n## Getting the master’s data\n\nThe malware also retrieves instructions from the mail server. It checks for mails in its\nBulgarian e-mail account with a particular subject tag. We have identified several “subject\ntags” in the network communication: Down_0, Down_1, Happy_0, Happy_2 and ddd_3.\nWhen found and the e-mail maintains an attachment, the malware downloads this\nattachment and saves it with filename “msdaipp.cnt” in C:Program FilesCommon\n_FilesSystemOle DB. The attacker can send additional executables in this way. The_\nexecutables are RC4 encrypted and then attached. The key for decryption is hardcoded in\nthe malicious samples. It’s interesting that the same “rsh!@!#” string is maintained across all\nknown samples and is used to generate RC4 keys. As described earlier, the malware\ncomputes the MD5 of this string and uses the hash as its RC4 key to decrypt the executable.\nThen, the plain executable is dropped onto disk as “sqlsoldb.exe” and run, and then moved\nto the C:Windows folder with the file name “taskmgr.exe”. The original e-mail and its\nattachment are then deleted from the Bulgarian e-mail inbox.\n\n## Key logger\n\nThe additional key logger module is not very complex — it simply intercepts keystrokes and\nwrites typed keys into C:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBmsolui80.inc, and also\nrecords the active window name where the user pressed keys. We saw this same format in\nthe [Madi malware. There is also one key logger variant that logs keystrokes into](http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/kaspersky_lab_and_seculert_announce_madi_a_newly_discovered_cyber_espionage_campaign_in_the_middle_east)\n_C:WINDOWSsetup.log._\n\n## Directory listing collector\n\n\n-----\n\nThe next program sent to victims enumerates all the drives on the infected system and\nexecutes the following command on them:\n\ndir <drive letter>: /a /s /t /-c\n\nIn practice, this command is written to C:WINDOWSmsdatt.bat and executed with output\nredirected to C:WINDOWSmsdatl3.inc. As a result, the latter maintains a listing of all files in\nall the folders on the drive. The malware later reads that data and appends it to content of\nthe file C:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBoledvbs.inc. At this point, “oledvbs.inc\n“already stores systeminfo output.\n\nIt’s interesting that one sample of the directory listing collector was infected with the infamous\n“Viking” virus of Chinese origin. Some of this virus’ modifications were wandering in the wild\nfor years and its authors or operators would never expect to see it end up in a clandestine\nAPT-related spying tool. For the attackers, this is certainly a big failure. Not only does the\noriginal spying program have marks of well-known malware that can be detected by antimalware products; moreover the attackers are revealing their secret activities to cybercriminal gangs. However, by all appearances, the attackers noticed the unwanted addition to\ntheir malware and got rid of the infection. This was the only sample bearing the Viking virus.\n\nDue to expensive work of malware with variety of additional files, it’s not out of place to show\nthese “relationships” in a diagram:\n\n\n-----\n\n## HWP document stealer\n\nThis module intercepts HWP documents on an infected computer. The HWP file format is\nsimilar to Microsoft Word documents, but supported by Hangul, a South Korean word\nprocessing application from the Hancom Office bundle. Hancom Office is widely used in\nSouth Korea. This malware module works independently of the others and maintains its own\nBulgarian e-mail account. The account is hardcoded in the module along with the master’s email to which it sends intercepted documents. It is interesting that the module does not\nsearch for all the HWP files on infected computer, but reacts only to those that are opened by\nthe user and steals them. This behavior is very unusual for a document-stealing component\nand we do not see it in other malicious toolkits.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe program copies itself as <Hangul full path>HncReporter.exe and changes the default\nprogram association in the registry to open HWP documents. To do so, it alters following\nregistry values:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOTHwp.Document.7shellopencommand\n\nor\n\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOTHwp.Document.8shellopencommand\n\n\nBy default, there is the registry setting “<Hangul full path>Hwp.exe” “%1” associating Hangul\napplication “Hwp.exe” with .HWP documents. But the malicious program replaces this string\nwith the following: “<Hangul full path>HncReporter.exe ” “%1”. So, when the user is opening\nany .HWP document, the malware program itself is executed to open the .HWP document.\nFollowing this registry edit, any opened .HWP document is read and sent as an e-mail\nattachment with the subject “Hwp” to the attackers. After sending, the malware executes the\nreal Hangul word processing application “Hwp.exe” to open the .HWP document as the user\nintended. The means the victim most likely will not notice the theft of the .HWP file. The\nmodule’s sending routine depends on the following files in C:Program FilesCommon\n_FilesSystemOle DB folder: xmlrwbin.inc, msdaipp.cnt, msdapml.cnt, msdaerr.cnt,_\n_msdmeng.cnt and oledjvs.inc._\n\n## Remote control module downloader\n\nAn extra program is dedicated exclusively to download attachments out of incoming e-mails\nwith a particular subject tag. This program is similar to the pivot module but with reduced\nfunctionality: it maintains the hardcoded Bulgarian e-mail account, logs in, reads incoming emails and searches for the special subject tag “Team“. When found, it loads the related\nattachment, drops it onto the hard drive as C:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle\n_DBtaskmgr.exe and executes. This particular executable arrives without any encryption._\n\n## Remote control module\n\nIt is also interesting that the malware author did not custom develop a backdoor program.\nInstead, the author modified TeamViewer client version 5.0.9104. The initial executable\npushed by attackers in e-mails related to the remote control module consists of three more\nexecutables. Two of them are Team Viewer components themselves, and another is some\nsort of backdoor loader. So, the dropper creates three files in the C:WindowsSystem32\ndirectory:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\nnetsvcs.exe - the modified Team Viewer client;\n\nnetsvcs_ko.dll - resources library of Team Viewer client;\n\nvcmon.exe - installer/starter;\n\n\nand creates the service “Remote Access Service“, adjusted to execute\n_C:WindowsSystem32vcmon.exe at system startup. Every time the vcmon.exe is executed, it_\ndisables AhnLab’s firewall by zeroing out following registry values:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\nHKLMSOFTWAREAhnLabV3 365 ClinicInternetSec\n\nUseFw = 0\n\nUseIps = 0\n\n\nThen, it modifies the Team Viewer registry settings. As we said, the Team Viewer\ncomponents used in this campaign are not the original ones. They are slightly modified. In\ntotal, we found two different variants of changed versions. The malware author replaced all\nthe entries of “Teamviewer” strings in Team Viewer components. In the first case with the\n“Goldstager” string and with the string “Coinstager” in the second. TeamViewer client registry\nsettings are then HKLMSoftwareGoldstagerVersion5 and HKLMSoftwareCoinstagerVersion5\ncorrespondingly. The launcher sets up several registry values that control how the remote\naccess tool will work. Among them is SecurityPasswordAES. This parameter represents a\nhash of the password with which a remote user has to connect to Team Viewer client. This\nway, the attackers set a pre-shared authentication value. After that, the starter executes the\nvery Team Viewer client netsvcs.exe.\n\n## Who’s Kim?\n\nIt’s interesting that the drop box mail accounts iop110112@hotmail.com and\n_rsh1213@hotmail.com are registered with the following “kim” names: kimsukyang and “Kim_\n_asdfa”._\n\nOf course, we can’t be certain that these are the real names of the attackers. However, the\nselection isn’t frequently seen. Perhaps it also points to the suspected North Korean origin of\nattack. Taking into account the profiles of the targeted organizations — South Korean\nuniversities that conduct researches on international affairs, produce defense policies for\ngovernment, national shipping company, supporting groups for Korean unification — one\nmight easily suspect that the attackers might be from North Korea.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe targets almost perfectly fall into their sphere of interest. On the other hand, it is not that\nhard to enter arbitrary registration information and misdirect investigators to an obvious North\nKorean origin. It does not cost anything to concoct fake registration data and enter\n_kimsukyang during a Hotmail registration. We concede that this registration data does not_\nprovide concrete, indisputable information about the attackers.\n\nHowever, the attackers’ IP-addresses do provide some additional clues. During our analysis,\nwe observed ten IP-addresses used by the Kimsuky operators. All of them lie in ranges of\nthe Jilin Province Network and Liaoning Province Network, in China.\n\nNo other IP-addresses have been uncovered that would point to the attackers’ activity and\nbelong to other IP-ranges. Interestingly, the ISPs providing internet access in these\nprovinces are also believed to maintain lines into North Korea. Finally, this geo-location\nsupports the likely theory that the attackers behind Kimsuky are based in North Korea.\n\n## Appendix\n\nFiles used by malware:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\n%windir%system32kbdlv2.dll\n\n%windir%system32auto.dll\n\n\n-----\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n\n%windir%system32netsvcs.exe\n\n%windir%system32netsvcs_ko.dll\n\n%windir%system32vcmon.exe\n\n%windir%system32svcsmon.exe\n\n%windir%system32svcsmon_ko.dll\n\n%windir%system32wsmss.exe\n\n%temp%~DFE8B437DD7C417A6D.TMP\n\n%temp%~DFE8B43.TMP\n\n%temp%~tmp.dll\n\nC:Windowstaskmgr.exe\n\nC:Windowssetup.log\n\nC:Windowswinlog.txt\n\nC:Windowsupdate.log\n\nC:Windowswmdns.log\n\nC:Windowsoledvbs.inc\n\nC:Windowsweoig.log\n\nC:Windowsdata.dat\n\nC:Windowssys.log\n\nC:WindowsPcMon.exe\n\nC:WindowsGoogle Update.exe\n\nC:WindowsReadMe.log\n\nC:Windowsmsdatt.bat\n\nC:Windowsmsdatl3.inc\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBmsdmeng.cnt\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBxmlrwbin.inc\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBmsdapml.cnt\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBsqlsoldb.exe\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBoledjvs.inc\n\n\n-----\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n35\n\n36\n\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBoledvbs.inc\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBmsolui80.inc\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBmsdaipp.cnt\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBmsdaerr.cnt\n\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesSystemOle DBsqlxmlx.inc\n\n&lt;Hangul full path&gt;HncReporter.exe\n\n\nRelated MD5:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n\n3baaf1a873304d2d607dbedf47d3e2b4\n\n3195202066f026de3abfe2f966c9b304\n\n4839370628678f0afe3e6875af010839\n\n173c1528dc6364c44e887a6c9bd3e07c\n\n191d2da5da0e37a3bb3cbca830a405ff\n\n5eef25dc875cfcb441b993f7de8c9805\n\nb20c5db37bda0db8eb1af8fc6e51e703\n\nface9e96058d8fe9750d26dd1dd35876\n\n9f7faf77b1a2918ddf6b1ef344ae199d\n\nd0af6b8bdc4766d1393722d2e67a657b\n\n45448a53ec3db51818f57396be41f34f\n\n80cba157c1cd8ea205007ce7b64e0c2a\n\nf68fa3d8886ef77e623e5d94e7db7e6c\n\n4a1ac739cd2ca21ad656eaade01a3182\n\n4ea3958f941de606a1ffc527eec6963f\n\n637e0c6d18b4238ca3f85bcaec191291\n\nb3caca978b75badffd965a88e08246b0\n\ndbedadc1663abff34ea4bdc3a4e03f70\n\n3ae894917b1d8e4833688571a0573de4\n\n8a85bd84c4d779bf62ff257d1d5ab88b\n\n\n-----\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n\nd94f7a8e6b5d7fc239690a7e65ec1778\n\nf1389f2151dc35f05901aba4e5e473c7\n\n96280f3f9fd8bdbe60a23fa621b85ab6\n\nf25c6f40340fcde742018012ea9451e0\n\n122c523a383034a5baef2362cad53d57\n\n2173bbaea113e0c01722ff8bc2950b28\n\n2a0b18fa0887bb014a344dc336ccdc8c\n\nffad0446f46d985660ce1337c9d5eaa2\n\n81b484d3c5c347dc94e611bae3a636a3\n\nab73b1395938c48d62b7eeb5c9f3409d\n\n69930320259ea525844d910a58285e15\n\n\nNames of services created by malware:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\nDriverManage\n\nWebService\n\nWebClientManager\n\nRemote Access Service\n\n\nWe detect these threats as Trojan.Win32.Kimsuky except modified Team Viewer client\ncomponents which are detected as Trojan.Win32.Patched.ps.\n\nAuthors\n\n[Dmitry Tarakanov](https://securelist.com/author/dmitryt/)\n\nThe “Kimsuky” Operation: A North Korean APT?\n\nYour email address will not be published.
