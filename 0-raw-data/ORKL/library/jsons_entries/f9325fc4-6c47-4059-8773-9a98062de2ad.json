The UNC2452 activity](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc2452-merged-into-apt29)_\n_described in this post is now attributed to APT29._\n\n[As the one-year anniversary of the discovery of the SolarWinds supply chain compromise](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor)\npasses, Mandiant remains committed to tracking one of the toughest actors we have\nencountered. These suspected Russian actors practice top-notch operational security and\nadvanced tradecraft. However, they are fallible, and we continue to uncover their activity and\nlearn from their mistakes. Ultimately, they remain an adaptable and evolving threat that must\nbe closely studied by defenders seeking to stay one step ahead.\n\n## Summary\n\nMandiant continues to track multiple clusters of suspected Russian intrusion activity that\nhave targeted business and government entities around the globe. Based on our\nassessment of these activities, we have identified two distinct clusters of activity, UNC3004\nand UNC2652. We associate both groups with UNC2452 also referred to as Nobelium by\nMicrosoft.\n\nSome of the tactics Mandiant has recently observed include:\n\nCompromise of multiple technology solutions, services, and reseller companies since\n2020.\nUse of credentials likely obtained from an info-stealer malware campaign by a thirdparty actor to gain initial access to organizations.\nUse of accounts with Application Impersonation privileges to harvest sensitive mail\ndata since Q1 2021.\nUse of both residential IP proxy services and newly provisioned geo located\ninfrastructure to communicate with compromised victims.\nUse of novel TTPs to bypass security restrictions within environments including, but not\nlimited to the extraction of virtual machines to determine internal routing configurations.\nUse of a new bespoke downloader we call CEELOADER.\nAbuse of multi-factor authentication leveraging “push” notifications on smartphones\n\nIn most instances, post compromise activity included theft of data relevant to Russian\ninterests. In some instances, the data theft appears to be obtained primarily to create new\nroutes to access other victim environments. The threat actors continue to innovate and\nidentify new techniques and tradecraft to maintain persistent access to victim environments,\nhinder detection, and confuse attribution efforts.\n\nThe following sections highlight intrusion activity from multiple incident response efforts that\nare currently tracked as multiple uncategorized clusters. Mandiant suspects the multiple\nclusters to be attributable to a common Russian threat. The information covers some of the\n\n\n-----\n\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actors for initial compromise,\nestablishing a foothold, data collection, and lateral movement; how the threat actors\nprovision infrastructure; and indicators of compromise. The information is being shared to\nraise awareness and allow organizations to better defend themselves.\n\n## Initial Compromise\n\n_Compromise of Cloud Services Providers_\n\nMandiant has identified multiple instances where the threat actor compromised service\nproviders and used the privileged access and credentials belonging to these providers to\ncompromise downstream customers.\n\nIn at least one instance, the threat actor identified and compromised a local VPN account\nand made use of this VPN account to perform reconnaissance and gain further access to\ninternal resources within the victim CSP’s environment, which ultimately led to the\ncompromise of internal domain accounts.\n\n_Access Obtained from Info-stealer Malware Campaign_\n\nMandiant identified a campaign where the threat actors gained access to the target\norganization’s Microsoft 365 environment using a stolen session token. Mandiant analyzed\nthe workstations belonging to the end user and discovered that some systems had been\ninfected with CRYPTBOT, an info-stealer malware, shortly before the stolen session token\nwas generated. Mandiant observed that in some cases the user downloaded the malware\nafter browsing to low reputation websites offering free, or “cracked”, software.\n\nMandiant assesses with moderate confidence that the threat actor obtained the session\ntoken from the operators of the info-stealer malware. These tokens were used by the actor\nvia public VPN providers to authenticate to the target’s Microsoft 365 environment.\n\n_Abuse of Repeated MFA Push Notifications_\n\nMandiant has also observed the threat actor executing multiple authentication attempts in\nshort succession against accounts secured with multi-factor authentication (MFA). In these\ncases, the threat actor had a valid username and password combination. Many MFA\nproviders allow for users to accept a phone app push notification or to receive a phone call\nand press a key as a second factor. The threat actor took advantage of this and issued\nmultiple MFA requests to the end user’s legitimate device until the user accepted the\nauthentication, allowing the threat actor to eventually gain access to the account.\n\n## Post Compromise Activity Via Cloud Solution Provider Compromise\n\n_Establish Foothold_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn at least one case, the threat actor compromised a Microsoft Azure AD account within a\nCloud Service Provider’s (CSP) tenant. The account held a specific Azure AD role that\nallowed it to use the Admin on Behalf Of (AOBO) feature. With AOBO, users with a specific\nrole in the CSP tenant have Azure Role Based Access Control (RBAC) Owner access to\nAzure subscriptions in their customer’s tenants that were created through the reseller\nrelationship. RBAC Owner access gives the role holder complete control over all resources\nwithin the Azure subscription. The threat actor leveraged the compromised csp’s credentials\nand the AOBO feature to gain privileged access to Azure subscriptions used to host and\nmanage downstream customer systems. The actor executed commands with NT\nAUTHORITY\\SYSTEM privileges within Azure VMs using the Azure Run Command feature.\nThe Azure Run Command feature allows a user to run PowerShell scripts within an Azure\nVM using the Azure Portal, REST API, or PowerShell without knowledge of Windows\ncredentials that are valid on the VM itself.\n\n_Privilege Escalation_\n\nMandiant found evidence that the threat actor used RDP to pivot between systems that had\nlimited internet access. The threat actor accessed numerous devices using RDP and\nexecuted several native Windows commands. On one device, the threat actors made use of\nthe Windows Task Manager to dump the process memory belonging to LSASS. The threat\nactor also obtained the Azure AD Connect configuration, the associated AD service account,\nand the key material used to encrypt the service account credentials. The Azure AD Connect\naccount is used to replicate the on-premise instance of Active Directory into Azure AD. In\naddition to this, the threat actor obtained the Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)\nsigning certificate and key material. This allowed the threat actor to forge a SAML token\nwhich could be used to bypass 2FA and conditional access policies to access Microsoft 365.\nThe actor stopped Sysmon and Splunk logging on these devices and cleared Windows\nEvent Logs.\n\nThe threat actors leveraged compromised privileged accounts and used SMB, remote WMI,\nremote scheduled tasks registration, and PowerShell to execute commands within victim\nenvironments. The threat actor used the protocols mainly to perform reconnaissance\n(notably using the native command tasklist.exe to inspect remote systems), distribute\nBEACON around the network, as well as run native Windows commands for credential\nharvesting. In some cases, the actors passed in a specific Kerberos ticket during the WMIC\nexecution using the /authority:Kerberos flag to authenticate as computer accounts. Computer\naccounts by design have local administrator rights over the computer for which they are\nnamed.\n\n_Lateral Movement Between CSP and Downstream Clients_\n\nCSPs have network filtering layers in place between their on-premises environment and\ndownstream customer environments as an added security layer. Mandiant identified that the\nthreat actor used the vSphere PowerCLI and custom PowerShell scripts configured to target\n\n\n-----\n\nthe vCenter Web endpoint to export the virtual disk image of a specific networking device\nand copy it off the service provider’s infrastructure. To authenticate to vCenter the threat\nactor used a stolen session cookie for a Privileged Access Management (PAM) account.\nMandiant believes the threat actor was able to analyze this virtual machine and identify\ndevices within the CSP’s network that were specifically allowed to communicate with\ntargeted downstream customers.\n\nUsing this knowledge, the actor compromised the authorized source jump hosts that\ncircumvented the network security restrictions of the service provider and downstream victim\nnetwork. The actor compromised a customer administration account from one of the\nadministration jump hosts used for customer administration within the CSP’s environment.\nThe CSP would connect via these jump hosts using dedicated customer admin accounts to\ninteract with a downstream customer’s infrastructure. The actor then performed lateral\nmovement through RDP and the stolen target credentials towards the victim customer\nnetwork.\n\nIn another case, the threat actor used Azure’s built-in Run Command feature to execute\ncommands on numerous downstream devices. The threat actor used native Windows tools\nto perform initial reconnaissance, credential theft and deploy Cobalt Strike BEACON to\ndevices via PowerShell.\n\nThe actor then used this BEACON implant to persistently install CEELOADER as a\nScheduled Task that ran on login as SYSTEM on specific systems. CEELOADER is\ndownloader that decrypts a shellcode payload to execute in memory on the victim device.\n\n_Data Collection_\n\nMandiant identified multiple attempts by the threat actor to dump the Active Directory\ndatabase (ntds.dit) using the built-in ntdsutil.exe command. There was also evidence that the\nthreat actor used Sysinternals ProcDump to dump the process memory of the LSASS\nprocess. In addition to this, Mandiant discovered that the threat actor had stolen the AD FS\ntoken signing certificate and the DKM key material. This would allow the threat actor to\nperform Golden SAML attacks and authenticate as any user into federated environments that\nused AD FS for authentication, such as Microsoft 365.\n\nThe threat actors performed data theft through several PowerShell commands, uploading\nseveral sequential archive files ending with the .7z extension. The threat actor uploaded\nthese files to a webserver they presumably controlled.\n\nMandiant identified binaries that were configured to upload data to the Mega cloud storage\nprovider. The threat actor deployed the tool in the %TEMP%\\d folder as mt.exe and mtt.exe.\nOwing to several mistakes made by the threat actor, Mandiant was able to identify that the\n\n\n-----\n\nexecution of the renamed tool failed. Upon investigation, it appears that the Megatools binary\nused by the threat actors fails to execute if renamed. Due to this it is unclear whether the\nactor was able to successfully exfiltrate data to Mega using this method.\n\nMandiant also observed the threat actor access a victim’s on-premises SharePoint server\nlooking for sensitive technical documentation and credentials. The threat actor then used the\ngathered credentials to move laterally around the network.\n\n_Application Impersonation_\n\nMicrosoft Exchange and Exchange Online provide an impersonation role (titled\nApplicationImpersonation) that grants an account the ability to access another account’s\nmailbox and “act as” that mailbox owner. Mandiant identified that the threat actor was able to\nauthenticate to an existing account that was previously granted the ApplicationImpersonation\nrole; it is unclear how the actor obtained this initial access.\n\nThrough this account, Mandiant witnessed the threat actor use impersonation to access\nmultiple mailboxes belonging to users within the victim organization. The threat actor also\ncreated a new account within the Microsoft 365 environment which Mandiant deems was for\nbackup access in the event of detection.\n\n## Threat Actor Infrastructure\n\n_Residential Internet Access_\n\nIn some campaigns, Mandiant identified that the threat actor was using residential IP\naddress ranges to authenticate to victim environments. Mandiant believes that this access\nwas obtained through residential and mobile IP address proxy providers. The providers proxy\ntraffic through actual mobile devices such as phones and tablets by legitimately bundling a\nproxy application in return for free applications and/or services.\n\nThe actor used these services to access mailboxes in victim Microsoft 365 tenants. By doing\nso, the source logon IP address belongs to a major Internet Service Provider that serves\ncustomers in the same country as the victim environment. These tactics showcase the\ncomplexity of the attacker's operations and is rarely seen executed by other threat actors.\nAccomplishing this can make it very difficult for investigators to differentiate between normal\nuser activity and the threat actor's activity.\n\n_Geo-located Azure Infrastructure_\n\nIn another campaign, the threat actor provisioned a system within Microsoft Azure that was\nwithin close proximity to a legitimate Azure-hosted system belonging to the CSP that they\nused to access their customer’s environment. This allowed the actor to establish geoproximity with the victims which resulted in the recorded source IP address for the activity\noriginating from within legitimate Azure IP ranges. Similar to the technique of using\n\n\n-----\n\nresidential IP addresses, using Azure infrastructure within close proximity to victim networks\nmakes it difficult for investigators to differentiate between normal user activity and the threat\nactor’s activity.\n\n_Compromised WordPress Sites Hosting Second Stage Payloads_\n\nIn several campaigns by the actor, Mandiant and our partners identified that the actor was\nhosting second stage payloads as encrypted blobs on legitimate websites running\nWordPress. Mandiant observed at least two separate malware families attributed to the\nthreat actor hosted on compromised WordPress sites.\n\n_TOR, VPS and VPN Providers_\n\nIn multiple campaigns by the threat actor, Mandiant witnessed the actor use a mixture of\nTOR, Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and public Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to access\nvictim environments. In a particular campaign, Mandiant identified that the threat actor\nperformed initial reconnaissance via a VPS provider located in the same region as the victim.\nMandiant believes a misconfiguration by the threat actor meant that the VPN services\nrunning on the VPS stopped functioning after 8 hours. Mandiant was then able to identify\nnumerous TOR exit nodes that the threat actor used based on new authentication events.\n\n## Operational Security and Planning\n\nMandiant identified attempts to compromise multiple accounts within an environment and\nkept use of each account separated by function. This reduced the likelihood that detecting\none activity could expose the entire scope of the intrusion. Mandiant found evidence that the\nactor compromised multiple accounts and used one for the sole purpose of reconnaissance,\nwhile the others were reserved for lateral movement within the organization. Mandiant\npreviously observed this threat actor using strict operational security to use specific accounts\nand systems in victim environments for activities that are often higher risk, such as data theft\nand large-scale reconnaissance.\n\nOnce within an environment, the threat actor was able to quickly pivot to on-premises\nservers and crawl these servers for technical documentation and credentials. From this\ndocumentation, the actor was able to identify a route to gain access to their ultimate target’s\nnetwork. This reconnaissance shows that the threat actor had a clear end goal in mind and\nwere able to identify and exploit an opportunity to obtain required intelligence to further their\ngoals.\n\nMandiant also observed efforts to avoid detection by circumventing or deleting system\nlogging within the victim’s environment. Namely, Mandiant identified the threat actor disabling\nSysInternals Sysmon and Splunk Forwarders on victim machines that they accessed via\nMicrosoft Remote Desktop in addition to clearing Windows Event Logs.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware Descriptions\n\n**Cobalt Strike BEACON: Backdoor written in C/C++ that is part of the Cobalt Strike**\nframework. Supported backdoor commands include shell command execution, file transfer,\nfile execution, and file management. BEACON can also capture keystrokes and screenshots\nas well as act as a proxy server. BEACON may also be tasked with harvesting system\ncredentials, port scanning, and enumerating systems on a network. BEACON communicates\nwith a command and control (C2) server via HTTP(S) or DNS.\n\n**CEELOADER: Downloader written in C programing language. It supports shellcode**\npayloads that are executed in memory. An obfuscation tool has been used to hide the code\nin CEELOADER in between large blocks of junk code with meaningless calls to the Windows\nAPI. The meaningful calls to the Windows API are hidden within obfuscated wrapper\nfunctions that decrypt the name of the API and dynamically resolve it before calling.\nCEELOADER communicates via HTTP and the C2 response is decrypted using AES-256 in\nCBC mode. Additionally, the HTTP request contains a statically defined id that may vary from\nsample to sample. CEELOADER does not contain a persistence mechanism.\n\n## Attribution\n\nMandiant assesses that some of this activity is UNC2652, a cluster of activity observed\ntargeting diplomatic entities with phishing emails containing HTML attachments with\nmalicious JavaScript, ultimately dropping a BEACON launcher.\n\nMandiant also assesses that some of this activity is UNC3004, a cluster of activity observed\ntargeting both government and business entities through gaining access to Cloud Solution\nProviders/Managed Service Providers to gain access to downstream customers.\n\n[Microsoft has previously reported on both UNC2652 and](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/05/27/nobelium-cyberattack-nativezone-solarwinds/) [UNC3004 activity and links it to](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/10/25/nobelium-targeting-delegated-administrative-privileges-to-facilitate-broader-attacks/)\nUNC2452, the group behind the SolarWinds compromise, under the name “Nobelium”. While\nit is plausible that they are the same group, currently, Mandiant does not have enough\nevidence to make this determination with high confidence.\n\n## Outlook and Implications\n\nThis intrusion activity reflects a well-resourced threat actor set operating with a high level of\nconcern for operational security. The abuse of a third party, in this case a CSP, can facilitate\naccess to a wide scope of potential victims through a single compromise. Though Mandiant\ncannot currently attribute this activity with higher confidence, the operational security\nassociated with this intrusion and exploitation of a third party is consistent with the tactics\nemployed by the actors behind the SolarWinds compromise and highlights the effectiveness\nof leveraging third parties and trusted vendor relationships to carry out nefarious operations.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n\n-----\n\nHundreds of consultants, analysts and reverse engineers have been working together to\nunderstand and track these security incidents over the past year. This larger group has built\na baseline of knowledge that enables us to continue tracking this actor. We would like to\nspecifically thank Luis Rocha, Marius Fodoreanu, Mitchell Clarke, Manfred Erjak, Josh\nMadeley, Ashraf Abdalhalim and Juraj Sucik from Mandiant Consulting and Wojciech\nLedzion, Gabriella Roncone, Jonathan Leathery and Ben Read from Mandiant Intelligence\nfor their assistance in writing and reviewing this blog post.\n\nAlso special thanks to the Microsoft DART and MSTIC teams for their ongoing collaboration.\n\n## Remediation\n\nMandiant recommends that organizations review and implement the changes suggested in\n[the following Mandiant white paper which was recently updated to include advice around the](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/remediation-and-hardening-strategies-for-microsoft-365-to-defend-against-unc2452)\nApplication Impersonation role and trust relationships with Cloud Service Providers and their\ncustomers.\n\n_Technical Highlights to Aid Investigations or Hunting_\n\n**Recent Staging Directories:**\n\n%PROGRAMFILES%\\Microsoft SQL
