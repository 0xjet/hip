Russian cyber attacks almost certainly will focus first on Ukraine, with\nWestern/NATO allies also being possible targets.\nOrganizations making statementscondemning Russian aggression and/or supporting\nUkraine and organizations taking actions to restrict Russian participation in\ninternational commerce, competitions, and events face elevated risk of future reprisal.\nWe assess that Sandworm and UNC2589 are two of the most likely actors to conduct\ncyber attacks in retaliation, although we judge that all high-profile Russian threat actors\nwill continue or increase cyber espionage to enhance decision advantage against\nUkrainian and NATO government targets.\n\n## Retaliatory Cyber Attacks Likely\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine again on February 24, 2022, triggering international condemnation\nof their actions and a series of responses from U.S., NATO, and European Union (EU) allies,\nincluding widespread sanctions from Western governments on Russian banks and elites\nconnected to the Putin regime. Mandiant observed multiple disruptive and destructive cyber\n\n\n-----\n\nattacks targeting Ukrainian government and private sectors, including the NEARMISS (aka\nHermeticWiper or FoxBlade) wiper attack on February 23, 2022, and the PAYWIPE (aka\nWhisperGate) wiper attack on January 15, 2022.\n\nWe anticipate that Russia could conduct retaliatory actions, including additional destructive\nor disruptive cyber attacks, particularly against the government, financial services, and\nenergy and utilities sectors. The nature and length of NATO and Western sanctions and\nresponses likely will heavily influence Russia's perception of high-priority targets for\nretaliation. Organizations making public statements condemning Russian aggression\n**and/or supporting Ukraine and organizations taking actions to restrict Russian**\n**participation in international commerce, competitions, and events face elevated risk of**\n**future reprisal.**\n\nFigure 1: Sectors facing elevated risk from Russian cyber operations\nFor mitigation and hardening recommendations, please review our:\n\nProactive Preparation and Hardening to Protect Against Destructive Attacks white\npaper\n[Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Protection Recommendations white paper](https://www.mandiant.com/media/14936/download)\n\n## Russian Decision Doctrine\n\n[Russian doctrine broadly follows a concept best described as \"controlled escalation” or](https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/time-to-terminate-escalate-to-de-escalateits-escalation-control/)\n[“escalation management/dominance,\" in which Russian forces gradually increase pressure,](https://www.cna.org/CNA_files/PDF/DRM-2019-U-022455-1Rev.pdf)\neither through kinetic or non-kinetic methods, while gauging the adversarial reaction to each\nstep until the adversary is willing to agree to favorable terms for Russia. In theory, Russia\nthen is able to continue to escalate its operations only as far as necessary to achieve its\ndesired outcome, relying on adversarial forces to back down first. This doctrine has\n[sometimes been less accurately described as “escalate to de-escalate,\" suggesting that](https://www.russiamatters.org/analysis/escalate-deescalate-part-russias-nuclear-toolbox)\nRussia will act in a significantly escalatory manner in order to achieve its goal, beyond the\nthreshold an adversary would be willing to cross, in an attempt to prevent adversarial\nescalation or response.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Russian Information Warfare Doctrine\n\n[Russian doctrine also views information warfare as a wide-ranging concept crucial to any](https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/CAOCL/files/RussiasInformationWarfare_MCUJ_Fall2019.pdf?ver=2019-11-19-093543-040)\n[armed and/or diplomatic conflict. Russian information warfare combines cyber operations,](https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/DOP-2016-U-014231-1Rev.pdf)\nelectronic warfare, psychological operations, and information operations, with the ultimate\n[goal of controlling the \"information sphere\"—a vital component of Russian strategy. In](https://jamestown.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Russias-Military-Strategy-and-Doctrine-web.pdf?x74728)\naddition to using destructive and disruptive cyber attacks in advance of kinetic ones (such as\nthose seen with PAYWIPE and NEARMISS), Russian doctrine calls for sustained information\nwarfare throughout the conflict, both as a supplement to military action and as a component\nof the aforementioned controlled escalation.\n\n## Russia Likely to Respond to Western Sanctions\n\nAs one tool in its response, we assess that Russia will almost certainly engage its offensive\ncyber programs to at least increase cyber espionage against primarily government targets to\nenhance decision advantage, and likely also conduct additional destructive or disruptive\ncyber attacks.\n\nRussia will likely task at least APT28 and Sandworm to engage Ukraine in multiple\nways, such as information operations, intelligence collection, and additional disruptive\nor destructive cyber attacks to degrade Ukraine's capabilities and supplement kinetic\naction.\nOther Russian state sponsored cyber espionage groups will—at a minimum—continue\nespionage activities against Ukraine and NATO-aligned nations. It is possible that\nRussian state sponsored operators will need to shift resources to focus on Ukraine and\nNATO-aligned nations during this conflict.\nCurrently, we assess that APT29 does not have a destructive mandate, whereas at\nleast Sandworm and TEMP.Isotope likely do. Although we have no evidence of this\nhappening in any previous operations, it is possible, however, that even actors without\na destructive mandate could be ordered to turn over their accesses to groups with a\ndestructive mandate in a time of war.\n\n## Likely Threat Actors\n\n### Sandworm\n\nSandworm likely poses the greatest threat for destructive and disruptive attacks based on\nthe group's historical targeting of and destructive operations against Ukraine, which included\nthe use of BLACKENERGYv2, BLACKENERGYv3, and INDUSTROYER as well as the\nNotPetya fake ransomware. Now that Russia has invaded Ukraine, Sandworm, or another\nentity sponsored by the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate’s (GRU) Main\nCenter for Special Technologies (GTsST), almost certainly is involved.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Recently, the U.S. and UK governments attributed a sophisticated supply chain](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/joint-advisory-shows-new-sandworm-malware-cyclops-blink-replaces-vpnfilter)\noperation to Sandworm, although Sandworm had not used this network for destructive\nactivity. Sandworm's disruptive operations have historically shown disregard or\nignorance of potential secondary and tertiary affects. This, for example, led to NotPetya\nspreading well beyond Ukraine and causing billions of dollars of damage worldwide.\n\n### UNC2589\n\nUNC2589 is a cyber espionage cluster active since at least early 2021 that has employed a\nconsistent set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Its focus has been primarily in\nUkraine and Georgia, but spearphishes have also been detected targeting Western\nEuropean and North American foreign ministries, pharmaceutical companies, and financial\nsector entities. We assess UNC2589 also has a destructive mandate, based on UNC2589’s\npossession of the WARYLOOK (aka WhiteBlackCrypt) file corruptor.\n\nUNC2589 has used a variety of publicly available and what appear to be proprietary\nmalware. This group likely is at least partially a government-sponsored entity that we have\nobserved conducting cyber espionage, but we have also observed UNC2589 using tools\nassociated with criminal activity. In mid-January 2022, a disruptive attack wiped multiple\nUkrainian government computers and defaced Ukrainian government websites. Malware\nused to launch the corruption tool has been used by UNC2589. The overlaps in malware and\ntargeting means it is plausible that UNC2589 conducted these attacks, although we have not\nattributed that activity to UNC2589 at this time.\n\nThe Ukrainian Government assesses this cluster is responsible for destructive activity\n[undertaken against it, and they track this cluster as UAC0056.](https://cert.gov.ua/article/18419)\nWe identified UNC2589 infrastructure that hosted the WARYLOOK file corruptor in\nJune 2021, which also indicates this actor has a destructive mandate. WARYLOOK\n(aka WhiteBlackCrypt) is a fake ransomware that has code overlap with SHADYLOOK\n(aka WhisperKill), the file corruptor used in the January 15 destructive attack on\nUkrainian networks. SHADYLOOK was not fake ransomware but was deployed with\nPAYWIPE (aka WhisperGate), which was posing as ransomware.\nThe attack on January 15 involved the use of GOOSECHASE (a subcomponent of\nWhisperGate) and FINETIDE (aka WhisperPack), both tools which we have observed\nUNC2589 also deploy. However, both GOOSECHASE and FINETIDE appear to have\nbeen used by multiple actors.\n\n### UNC3715\n\nWe currently track the actor responsible for the February 23 NEARMISS (aka\nHermeticWiper) wiper attack as UNC3715. Although we have not yet connected this group to\nother named actors that we track, this group may carry a broad destructive mandate as well,\n\n\n-----\n\nbased on its deployment of NEARMISS. NEARMISS was notably more sophisticated and\ncapable than PAYWIPE, which could indicate this group has more resources available to it or\nis a component of another actor we track.\n\n### TEMP.Isotope\n\nMandiant assesses that TEMP.Isotope also has a destructive mandate, although we have\nnot observed this group use a tool capable of destruction. However, this group’s choice of\ntargets and data collection indicates an intent to conduct disruptive or destructive activities in\nthe event they are tasked to do so. They have historically targeted primarily western Europe\nand North America, with a focus on energy, local governments, and transportation, but also\n[have targeted water and other critical infrastructure facilities.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)\n\n### Criminal Actors\n\nThe Russian intelligence services almost certainly have the ability to coopt criminals residing\nwithin Russia in order to achieve their desired ends, although we assess the Kremlin\nprimarily overlooks criminal operations as long as they refrain from targeting Russian\n[domestic entities. In addition to financially motivated groups, hacktivist groups have also](https://cyberknow.medium.com/2022-russia-ukraine-war-cyber-group-tracker-update-2-e62239184510)\nbeen conducting cyber operations in support of both Russia and Ukraine.\n\nWe consider it plausible that Russia could seek to use criminal actors against NATO\nnations as a means of reprisal. Criminal actors that reside in Russia often target\nentities within NATO nations and we surmise that Russia could task them to conduct\ndestructive or disruptive operations against financial entities, relying heavily on\nransomware or wipers as the method of disruption. However, it is similarly possible\nthey could use other disruptive or destructive methods.\n[The CONTI ransomware group announced at the end of February that it would offer its](https://www.cyberscoop.com/conti-ransomware-russia-ukraine-critical-infrastructure/)\n\"full support of Russian government\" against the West, supposedly to help counteract\nWestern aggression against Russia. Conti has reportedly also conducted targeting of\njournalists on behalf of the FSB.\n\nSandworm has historically used customized or generic versions of criminal tools and\ntechniques in their operations, including their well-known employment of a modified\nBlackEnergy variant to disrupt the Ukrainian power grid in 2015. In June 2017, Sandworm\nunleashed on Ukraine NotPetya, which was a destructive tool built off and masquerading as\nthe Petya ransomware. The campaign appeared designed to closely mimic a financially\nmotivated operation, likely in an attempt to obfuscate its true purpose serving Russian\nstrategic interests in Ukraine. Both BlackEnergy and Petya source code had been leaked or\nwas publicly accessible before Sandworm deployed their modified variants, although we\ncannot rule out that Sandworm might have engaged with the malware developers.\n\n## Russian Disruptive or Destructive Operations Against Financial Sector\n\n\n-----\n\nMandiant anticipates that Russian action against the financial sector outside of the conflict\nzone will include cyber espionage to gather information about implementation of Western\nand international sanctions. We expect that Russian cyber threat actors will continue to\nconduct disruptive operations and spread disinformation regarding the Ukrainian financial\nsector during the conflict. This activity may spill over to neighboring countries—like NotPetya\n[did in 2017, resulting in billions of dollars in](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-accused-massive-12-billion-cyber-attack-807867) [damage](https://www.wsj.com/articles/one-year-after-notpetya-companies-still-wrestle-with-financial-impacts-1530095906) [worldwide—or banking networks closely](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lessons-to-learn-from-devastating-notpetya-cyberattack-wired-investigation/)\nconnected to Ukraine's, and in extreme cases, Russia could choose to conduct disruptive or\ndestructive activity against financial sector organizations outside of Ukraine.\n\nWe assess that a destructive mandate has likely been assigned to at least Sandworm,\nTEMP.Isotope, and possibly UNC2589. We judge that although APT29 likely has the\ntechnical proficiency to create their own disruptive malware or the potential to purchase this\n[malware from contract development teams such as those included in the SolarWinds](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0127)\n[sanctions, they likely do not have a disruptive or destructive mandate as they have not been](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-activities-by-the-russian-government/)\nobserved conducting these operations or targeting critical infrastructure in preparation for\ndisruptive or destructive activity.\n\nHistorically, Russia-sponsored targeting of financial entities has been relatively limited,\nthough Mandiant has observed likely Russian malware called QUIETCANARY at a European\nfinancial entity in the last six months. However, some older activity and significant recent\n[Russian-sponsored disinformation and disruptive operations targeted Ukrainian financial](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cyberattacks-hit-websites-and-psy-ops-sms-messages-targeting-ukrainians-ramp-up-as-russia-moves-into-ukraine)\ninstitutions, likely in an attempt to reduce the Ukrainian public's trust in its financial system.\n\nIf NATO elects to remove additional Russian entities from SWIFT or sanctions Russian\nentities that cross a Russian-perceived red line, Russia will likely respond, and could take\naction against NATO-aligned financial entities in a tit-for-tat response.\n\n## Energy Sector Also Likely Under Threat\n\nWe currently judge that if the NATO/Western response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine was\nperceived by Russian leadership as escalatory, Russia will likely seek to escalate in a\nmanner that it deems proportional, without drawing NATO further into conflict.\n\nThe decision to sanction Russian financial institutions as well as the cancellation of\nNord Stream 2 is likely to lead to a Russian response. Russia likely has multiple\noptions they could utilize as a part of their decision calculus, which could include\nenergy cost hikes, destructive cyber operations, or other economic measures designed\nto hurt Europe more than Russia.\n\n### Possible Russian Responses\n\nWe judge there are two linked, viable measures Russia may choose to impose cost on\nNATO-affiliated countries that would be less likely to draw NATO further info conflict: directly\nraising the cost of Russian gas supplies to Europe and disruptive or destructive cyber\n\n\n-----\n\noperations against non-Russian organizations that supply gas to Europe.\n\nDue to Europe's reliance on Russian energy supplies, raising the cost of gas as a part\nof an incremental escalatory measure likely would cause NATO nations and their\ncitizens distress, without offering NATO sufficient justification to draw them into the war.\nHigher gas prices concurrently could cause backlash against the elected government\nofficials of NATO nations, potentially damaging their reputation and reducing their\npolitical leverage both abroad and at home.\nRussian cyber attacks on energy-related facilities outside of NATO nations—which\nwould likely include Middle Eastern entities—could reduce the likelihood of a NATO\nresponse while simultaneously reducing NATO's leverage to respond to increased\nprices.\n\nFor example, Russian natural gas currently accounts for 40% of all of Europe's\ngas supplies. If Russia judges that raising prices is not an appropriate escalatory\nmeasure, Russia could undertake cyber attack operations against non-European\nsuppliers as a means to raise gas prices and disrupt supply chains.\n\nThese two options could limit the likelihood of disruptive or destructive cyber attacks against\nNATO energy entities, as such operations are more likely to cause a significant escalatory\nresponse from NATO and the U.S. However, it increases the possibility that Russia could\nseek to conduct operations outside of NATO's purview.\n\n## Media and Entertainment Industry a Possible Target\n\nRussia's ban from the [Eurovision song contest, or the multiple sports organizations'](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-60530513)\n[decisions to cancel sporting events with Russian teams or move competitions to new](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/33396647/russia-barred-all-international-ice-skating-events-following-invasion-ukraine)\nlocations that were formerly scheduled to take place in Russia, could also spur Russian\nretaliatory action against the media and entertainment sector. Russia has historically placed\na premium on its competition in high-profile international sports and entertainment events\nand has previously used cyber operations to retaliate for perceived grievances.\n\nAs noted, Russian information warfare doctrine calls for control of the information sphere\n[and, as a result, Ukrainian media organizations will likely also be targeted in both](https://twitter.com/VeraMBergen/status/1498669937254191113) [physical](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1498679703628136458)\n[and cyber space to help disseminate fabricated pro-Russia content, such as allegations of](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/02/security-updates-ukraine/)\nthe surrender of Ukrainian government or military forces, as well as to interrupt Ukrainian\ncommand and control and pro-Ukraine messaging.\n\n[If Russian state media channels continue to be blocked widely, Russia likely will](https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/youtube-block-channels-linked-russias-rt-sputnik-across-europe-2022-03-01/)\nrespond with symmetric action to close Western news sites in Russia. It is possible that\nRussia may take further action in cyberspace if they feel Western outlets can still\nsuccessfully reach Russian audiences.\n\n\n-----\n\nNotably, some of this type of activity likely will not be immediate; Russian cyber threat\noperators may begin planning and establishing access to targeted environments, but any\npublic-facing leaks, disruptions, or influence campaigns are more likely to coincide with\nfuture sport or entertainment events to maximize the impact of the activity.\n\n### Olympic Athlete Doping Scandal\n\nAfter the International Olympic Committee (IOC)-confirmed allegations of a widespread\nRussian state-sponsored doping program, many Russian athletes were banned from the\n[2016 Summer Games, initiating a series of \"hack-and-leak\" and information operations that](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/report-apt28-a-window-into-russias-cyber-espionage-operations)\nRussia almost certainly intended as retaliation.\n\nMost notably under the guise of the \"Fancy Bears' Hack Team,\" APT28 began a hackand-leak [campaign targeting the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) through major](https://www.cyberscoop.com/fancy-bear-olympic-hack-ioc-wada/)\nsocial media platforms and purpose-made websites. WADA had sponsored the original\ninquiry into Russian doping violations, which led to the 2016 ban. APT28 compromised\nWADA and other Olympic or sporting organizations networks during multiple operations\nfrom at least 2016–2018. In one instance, the Russian cutouts leaked the data of\nWestern athletes who had been approved for medical exemptions for certain drug\nprescriptions, likely to portray these athletes as no better than the banned Russian\nathletes.\n\nRussia was subsequently fully banned from the 2018 Winter Games, with a small number of\nRussian athletes allowed to compete under a neutral flag.\n\n[In February 2018, Sandworm likely conducted the cyber attack on the Opening](https://www.wired.com/story/untold-story-2018-olympics-destroyer-cyberattack/)\nCeremony at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. This attack was likely\nagain in retribution for Russia's ban from the Games.\n\n## Transportation and Logistics Sector Also Faces Elevated Risk, Particularly Aviation\n\nMultiple global transportation sector organizations have begun to withdraw services and\nsupport to Russian organizations and this drawback could spur Russian retaliation both in an\neffort to punish the organizations responsible as well as attempt to stop more organizations\nfrom isolating Russia further.\n\n[Transportation and logistics giants like FedEx, UPS, and](https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/596149-ups-fedex-halt-inbound-shipments-to-russia) [Maersk announced they](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/2/maersk-cma-cgm-and-msc-suspend-russian-deliveries)\nwould stop servicing Russian clients, cutting off major sources of global shipping and\ndelivering to and from Russia.\nAviation organizations may face particularly elevated risk, given the extensive impact\nthese actions will have on both domestic and international Russian travel. Global\n[reservations provider Sabre will no longer serve Russian carriers and both Boeing and](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/03/airline-software-giant-sabre-ends-service-with-russias-aeroflot-crippling-carriers-ability-to-sell-seats.html)\nAirbus announced they would cease providing support to Russian clients.\n\n\n-----\n\nConcurrently, destructive operations undertaken by Russian threat actors against other\nsectors may have secondary and tertiary effects against entities within the\n[transportation sector similar to when NotPetya disrupted Maersk in 2017.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-the-key-lesson-maersk-learned-from-battling-the-notpetya-attack/)\n\nRussia likely lacks other forms of leverage against these organizations, so disruptive cyber\noperations are likely if Russia selects to retaliate against organizations in this sector. Russia\nhas previously targeted the aviation industry, including a Russian cyber attack on Boryspil\n[airport outside Kyiv and a compromise of a U.S.-based airport’s systems.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/russian-state-hackers-behind-san-francisco-airport-hack/)\n\n## Outlook and Implications\n\nRussia will almost certainly continue to use cyber operations for a variety of reasons to\ninclude espionage, information operations, and disruptive or destructive measures. In the\nevent a disruptive or destructive action is selected, Russia is likely to task actors including\nSandworm, UNC2589, UNC3715, and possibly TEMP.Isotope. Government, financial sector,\nenergy and utility, and transportation and logistics organizations face elevated risk.\nSandworm and UNC2589 are likely the most significant threats to NATO-aligned entities in\nthe event Russia seeks retribution for perceived NATO escalation beyond Russian red lines,\nsuch as more Russian banks' removal from SWIFT, or continued lethal aid NATO partners\nare sharing with Ukrainian forces. Russia could also task criminal groups to conduct\ndestructive or disruptive operations thereby muddying attribution while still responding to\nperceived NATO escalation.\n\nCurrently, it is difficult to predict how Russia's invasion of Ukraine might unfold and the\nconsequences NATO will continue to seek to impose on Russia. However, sanctions like\nthose against Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, and the potential for Russia's full removal\nfrom SWIFT may be red lines that will cause Russia to lash out at NATO-aligned\norganizations.\n\n\n-----",
