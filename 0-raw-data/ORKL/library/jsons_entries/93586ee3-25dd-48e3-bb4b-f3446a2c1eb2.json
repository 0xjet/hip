To read the_**\n_[entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/mtp-2021-1214.pdf)_\n\nThis report provides a technical overview of 5 prominent web shells: Alfa,\nKrypton, SharPyShell, ASPXSpy, and TWOFACE. It contains details on the\ncapabilities of the web shells and host-based and network-based detections.\nThis report is intended for security operations audiences who focus on\ndetection engineering. Sources include the Recorded Future Platform®,\nGreyNoise, Shodan, and BinaryEdge.\n\n**Executive Summary**\n\nWeb shells are common and powerful tools used by threat actors to maintain\naccess to public-facing web servers. They are lightweight, sometimes\ncontaining as few as 4 lines of code, and let threat actors execute secondary\npayloads, escalate privileges, exfiltrate data, and move laterally within the\ncompromised network. Web shells often go undetected due to the small\nfootprint left during their use, an organization’s limited visibility of their publicfacing servers, and the ability for web shell-associated network traffic to blend\n\n\n-----\n\nin with normal web server activity. Our research provides a full-spectrum\napproach to detecting web shells, combining log analysis, network analysis,\nand web shell scanning techniques. We focus on a subset of web shells\nrecently used by state-sponsored and criminal threat actors: Alfa, SharPyShell,\nKrypton, ASPXSpy, and TWOFACE. Our methodology and detections can be\napplied internally for defenders but also by security researchers hunting for the\npresence of web shells on externally facing servers.\n\n**Key Judgments**\n\nWeb shells will continue to be used by both APTs and financially\nmotivated threat actors, primarily due to their ease of use and their\ndifficulty in being detected.\nWe identified 4 techniques to detect web shells that can be used together:\nYARA rules, Sigma rules, network traffic patterns, and internal/external\nscanning. While these methods are not foolproof, they provide diverse\nopportunities for defenders to look for web shells on their systems.\nSecurity teams with limited host and network visibility can still detect web\nshells on their systems using HTTP scanning techniques.\nAs long as threat actors can viably exploit public-facing servers, they will\ncontinue to use web shells to maintain persistence and provide additional\ncapabilities.\n\n**_Editor’s Note: This post was an excerpt of a full report.
