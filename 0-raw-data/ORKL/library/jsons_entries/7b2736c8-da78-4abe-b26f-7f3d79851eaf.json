Government, like industry, is facing the fact that its productivity tools are being turned against its interests and its ability to protect and provide essential services, ensure economic stability, and even maintain cultural and societal cohesion.\n\n The path to “digital by default”\n\nOf course, these heightened risks come at a time\n\nwhen government bodies and businesses are still\n\nnavigating a course through the coronavirus\n\npandemic, adding to what is already a complex\n\noperating environment for those responsible for IT\n\ninfrastructure and security. While there are\n\ndifferences between the functions of different\n\ngovernment bodies, the overall trend is that the\n\nattack surface is expanding. This is reinforced by the\n\nfact that government bodies are edging toward\n\ndigital services that are so straightforward and\n\nconvenient that all those who can use them will\n\n###### Andy Garth choose to do so.\n\nGovernment Affairs Lead\n\nThese elements include further rollout of citizen\nfacing systems, moving to the cloud, increasing use\n\nof third-party suppliers and service providers, and\n\nrapid onboarding of many users due to home or\n\n\n###### Andy Garth\n\nGovernment Affairs Lead\n\n\n-----\n\nhybrid work becoming part of the new operating model.\n\nBeing implemented at pace, these elements add to the\n\nchallenge of maintaining system resilience in the face of\n\nsustained and evolving threats from advanced persistent\n\nthreat (APT) groups and cybercriminals. Throw in keeping\n\nan eye on the regulatory scene and operating within\n\ntight budgets, and there is certainly plenty to keep a CISO\n\nawake at night.\n\n###### COVID-19\n\nCoronavirus lockdowns and the subsequent surge of\n\nemployees accessing both company and institutional\n\ndata, as well as IT infrastructure, from home did little to\n\ndampen the interests of cybercriminal gangs and nation\nstate actors. Indeed, both groups exploited this\n\ntumultuous period to pursue their respective goals, often\n\nwith increased intensity and persistence. For example,\n\nduring the pandemic, RDP attack attempts in particular\n\n_[increased by 768% between Q1 and Q4 2020.](https://www.eset.com/int/about/newsroom/press-releases/research/eset-issues-its-q4-2020-threat-report-recording-a-massive-increase-in-rdp-attack-attempts-since-q1/)_\n\nOther threats detected by ESET specifically leveraging\n\nCOVID-19 as a topic of interest include the mimicking of\n\ngovernment services; for example, a “Canadian\n\nGovernment” _[contact tracing app. Amid COVID-19](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/06/24/new-ransomware-uses-covid19-tracing-guise-target-canada-eset-decryptor/)_\n\nlockdowns, steady servings of _[phishing with “official](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/01/12/operation-spalax-targeted-malware-attacks-colombia/)_\n\n_[Colombian Government” email correspondence and watering](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/01/12/operation-spalax-targeted-malware-attacks-colombia/)_\n\n[hole attacks on Southeast Asian governments courtesy](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/11/20/oceanlotus-new-watering-hole-attack-southeast-asia/)\n\n_[of OceanLotus, among others, have seen the interface](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/11/20/oceanlotus-new-watering-hole-attack-southeast-asia/)_\n\nbetween government and its citizens under assault.\n\nWith pressure already on governments to mitigate health\n\nimpacts from COVID-19, reports abound of cyberattacks\n\naffecting service delivery to citizens, data theft, or the\n\ncompromise of strategic national infrastructure. Some\n\n[of the most prominent of late include the SolarWinds](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/02/17/attacks-targeting-it-firms-stir-concern-controversy/)\n\n_[Orion hack, the Microsoft Exchange exploitation, attacks on](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/02/17/attacks-targeting-it-firms-stir-concern-controversy/)_\n\n[the Centreon IT infrastructure monitoring tool, deliberate](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/02/17/attacks-targeting-it-firms-stir-concern-controversy/)\n\ntargeting of healthcare systems in France and Germany,\n\nand increased attacks on schools, universities, and\n\neducation IT platforms.\n\nLooking at the data and overall trends, we expect APT\n\ngroups and cybercriminals to continue to hone their\n\ntactics that capitalize on COVID-19-related concerns and\n\n\nan increase in the targeting of widely used applications.\n\nIn early 2020, for example, the XDSpy APT group operators\n\n_[crafted an email purportedly from the Belarussian](https://www.virusbulletin.com/conference/vb2020/abstracts/xdspy-stealing-government-secrets-2011/)_\n\nauthorities that claimed to confirm the first cases of\n\ncoronavirus in Belarus. However, not only was this a work\n\nof disinformation making its rounds on social media\n\nnetworks, but it also contained a link to a piece\n\nof malware.\n\n###### Cyberespionage\n\nThe traditional nemeses of government bodies are\n\nbelieved to be state actors looking to steal sensitive data\n\nand increasingly seeking to embarrass, undermine, and\n\ndisrupt in order to secure their political and economic\n\nobjectives. Such contests between states regularly\n\nhappen in the gray zone where they can engage each\n\nother under the premise of plausible deniability. Now\n\nwithin this traditional cyber-sport, we see in the economic\n\nsphere—a constant high-priority target—a significant\n\nuptick in pursuit of purloining intellectual property,\n\n[including the targeting of vaccine developers and their](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/02/26/oxford-university-covid19-laboratory-hack/)\n\nsupply chains. These activities brush up against, if not\n\noutright crash into, governments’ ability to protect and\n\nprovide services to citizens.\n\nWith the attackers seeking to steal data or influence\n\nevents in the real world, the gamut of the public sector,\n\nfrom national to local, should now adapt its posture to\n\nfactor in targeting by these state actors—not merely as\n\ntargets of criminal groups or lone hackers. State actor\n\nactivity is increasing, yet there will be some bodies who\n\nthink they would be unlikely targets of these actors.\n\nUnfortunately, all too often—given interconnectivity—\n\nstate vs. state contests in one area of the globe have\n\ninadvertently affected systems in countries and\n\norganizations unrelated to those contexts. So, becoming\n\ncollateral damage in these growing battles in cyberspace\n\nis a genuine risk.\n\nOne example of an APT group that at times seems to act\n\n[rather boldly, making no efforts to hide, is Gamaredon,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/06/11/gamaredon-group-grows-its-game/)\n\nwhose modus operandi includes the use of template\n\ninjectors targeting ever-popular applications like\n\nMicrosoft Word and Excel, and mass-mailing macros in\n\n\n-----\n\nthe near ubiquitous Microsoft Outlook to target, for\n\nexample, individuals at various Ukrainian institutions. By\n\nhoming in on legitimate tools used across government\n\nand businesses, Gamaredon is very effective at\n\nfingerprinting a machine, understanding what sensitive\n\ndata is available, and then spreading throughout the\n\nnetwork. We have recently documented the group’s move\n\nto custom-developed malware.\n\nWith impressive tools that include fileless malware, such\n\nas a custom open-source PowerShell loader to thwart\n\n[detection, or its LightNeuron malware tailored to wreak](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/05/07/turla-lightneuron-email-too-far/)\n\nhavoc on the now all-too-preyed-upon Microsoft\n\nExchange servers, the Turla APT group is mainly interested\n\nin high-profile targets such as government bodies and\n\ndefense companies. Not to rest on its laurels, Turla created\n\n[a new version of Crutch, which we documented in Q4](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/02/turla-crutch-keeping-back-door-open/)\n\n2020, that monitors external drives and abuses cloud\n\nstorage for command and control communications.\n\n###### Ransomware: Innovation and steady pressure\n\nIn the strata where state-sponsored actors blend with\n\nAPT groups more criminal in nature, we can view the\n\nshift toward targeted ransomware attacks as an indicator\n\nof growing concern to government bodies and the\n\nbusinesses that they engage with. In addition, the\n\nphenomenon of several criminal groups working in\n\ncooperation to gain entry, steal or encrypt data, arrange\n\npayment, and launder the proceeds stands as\n\na clear worry.\n\nESET’s October 2020 collaboration with Microsoft, NTT\n\nLtd, and multiple law enforcement agencies to disrupt\n\nTrickbot botnets revealed complex activity that included\n\noperators moving from attempting to steal money from\n\nbank accounts to compromising whole organizations\n\nwith Trickbot and then using it to execute Ryuk to demand\n\na ransom to unlock the affected systems. Interestingly,\n\n[as Trickbot activity tapered off, rising detections in ESET](https://www.eset.com/blog/business/trickbot-botnet-grows-quieter-emotet-botnet-gets-busy/)\n\n_[telemetry for the Emotet botnet signaled a ramping up of](https://www.eset.com/blog/business/trickbot-botnet-grows-quieter-emotet-botnet-gets-busy/)_\n\nactivities, including even downloading Trickbot.\n\n\nThe emerging connection ultimately saw another botnet\n\ndisruption in January 2021, against one of the longest\n[lived and most pervasive malware threats, Emotet. Led](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/01/28/emotet-botnet-disrupted-global-operation/)\n\nby Europol, this large-scale disruption operation included\n\na number of national law enforcement agencies across\n\nEurope and North America.\n\nWith stakes this high, security staff tasked with defending\n\nservice provision and internal processes are also\n\nsandwiched between staying vigilant for state actors\n\nand constantly facing maturing tactics, techniques, and\n\nprocedures from APT groups. Furthermore, the\n\nemergence of this organized criminal industry with clear\n\nproduct and service offerings demonstrates innovation\n\nand drive among attackers. These groups have moved\n\nbeyond assessing potential victims and obtaining the\n\nlargest payout to maximizing the sale of data on now\n\nwell-established criminal marketplace platforms.\n\nFurthermore, via persistence, these groups can often\n\nspend weeks or months inside targeted systems\n\nconducting reconnaissance, harvesting data, and\n\n_[eventually deploying ransomware. While for some it will be](https://www.eset.com/blog/enterprise/microsoft-exchange-exploits-step-one-in-ransomware-chain/)_\n\na means to top up their funding, for others, the objective\n\nis more about undermining the host government and\n\n[the services it oversees. Despite many governments openly](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/10/06/us-government-warns-paying-off-ransomware-attackers/)\n\n_[stating they do not pay ransoms, they can still be victimized—](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/10/06/us-government-warns-paying-off-ransomware-attackers/)_\n\nincluding via “spray and pray” techniques – which can\n\nbe distracting and resource intensive to deal with and,\n\nif successful, equally devastating.\n\n###### Supply-chain attacks scaling rapidly\n\nSupply-chain disruption, whether by accident or by\n\ndesign, can be traced to antiquity, as can its protection\n\nor improved resilience. However, digitization and the\n\ncollaborative benefits derived from third-party providers\n\n[have in turn increased the risk of supply-chain attacks.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/04/07/supply-chain-attacks-when-trust-goes-wrong-try-hope/)\n\nThe _[DiskCoder.C (aka NotPetya) attack in 2017](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/07/04/analysis-of-telebots-cunning-backdoor/)_\n\ndemonstrated this well, when the regionally popular\n\nM.E.Doc accounting software used by a number of\n\nbusinesses and their partners along a supply chain was\n\nweaponized to disrupt users’ businesses. However,\n\ncollateral damage—anticipated or not—impacted major\n\n\n-----\n\nglobal businesses, ironically many involved in logistics\n\nserving the world’s physical supply chains. Fast-forward\n\nthree years, and instead of weaponized accounting\n\nsoftware, we’ve encountered a very large persistence\n\ncampaign in the _[SolarWinds Orion hack. The attack](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/02/17/attacks-targeting-it-firms-stir-concern-controversy/ )_\n\nimpacted thousands of users across that platform and\n\nopened up the potential for widespread criminal and APT\n\ngroup activity across the board.\n\nESET researchers have uncovered several other supply\nchain attacks over the past several months, from the\n\n_[Lazarus group using hacked security add-ons, to Operation](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/11/16/lazarus-supply-chain-attack-south-korea/)_\n\n_[Stealthy Trident attacking region-specific chat software](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/10/luckymouse-ta428-compromise-able-desktop/)_\n\n[for businesses, Operation SignSight, used to compromise](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/17/operation-signsight-supply-chain-attack-southeast-asia/)\n\na government certificate authority, to _[Operation](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/02/01/operation-nightscout-supply-chain-attack-online-gaming-asia/)_\n\n_[NightScout, a hacked Android emulator.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/02/01/operation-nightscout-supply-chain-attack-online-gaming-asia/)_\n\n###### Home, the new normal workplace\n\nHome and hybrid working have significantly increased\n\nthe risks for all employers and hence government bodies.\n\nIt is clear that these arrangements will endure and\n\ncontinue to be a source of concern as some form of\n\nongoing hybrid working becomes part of the operating\n\nmodel post-COVID-19. From a system security point of\n\nview, the home environment can feel more like the Wild\n\nWest with “homesteads” and “outposts” more exposed\n\nto cyberattacks from a seemingly ever-growing crop of\n\nincreasingly sophisticated cyberbandits looking to rustle\n\nup some action.\n\n[It is estimated that 23% of cybersecurity breaches are due](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/08/12/what-is-cost-data-breach/)\n\n_[to human error.

However, some of the largest breaches\n\nhave been through the actions of experienced IT\n\nprofessionals— who should have known better—including\n\nvia connecting BYO devices, misconfiguring cloud\n\nsystems, and other poor practices. Of course, increased\n\nstaff training and strengthening processes are essential\n\nto embed the required security behaviors as instinctive.\n\n\nAnd while a lot of attention is paid to hacker attacks, in\n\n[its 2020 Cost of Insider Threats: Global Report, Ponemon](https://www.observeit.com/2020costofinsiderthreat/)\n\nInstitute revealed that the number of reported incidents\n\ncaused by insiders increased by 47%, from 3,200 in 2018\n\nto 4,716 in 2020.

In a year of much disruption and sadness,\n\none of the positive trends in cybersecurity, as much as\n\nin the fight against coronavirus, is the emergence and\n\nimportance of a strong partnership between government\n\nand the private sector to tackle these challenges. ESET\n\nwelcomes this and looks forward to working with its\n\ngovernment partners to better secure a safer digital world.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2\n\n### APT ATTACKS IN EUROPE: A GROWING MENACE TO GOVERNMENT\n\n\n###### Do the past half year’s attention-grabbing attacks conducted by APT groups signal business as usual, or an emerging trend in supply-chain attacks?\n\nIn the past six months, a rash of notable advanced\n\npersistent threat (APT) attacks have been revealed,\n\ntargeting countries across the European continent,\n\nfrom France to Eastern Europe and the Balkans, and\n\nacross verticals, from government and military\n\nentities to private companies.\n\nAn example of APT activity discovered by ESET is\n\n[a new version of Crutch, a previously undocumented](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/02/turla-crutch-keeping-back-door-open/)\n\nbackdoor and document stealer belonging to the\n\ninfamous Turla APT group. ESET researchers saw\n\nCrutch in the network of a ministry of foreign affairs\n\nin a European Union country. Another discovery was\n\n[activity by Gamaredon, an adversary group known](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/02/turla-crutch-keeping-back-door-open/)\n\n###### Robert Lipovský for its relentless targeting of governmental\n\n[organizations in Ukraine – which updated its malware](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ESET_Threat_Report_Q32020.pdf)\n\nSenior Malware Researcher\n\n_[arsenal through 2020.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ESET_Threat_Report_Q32020.pdf)_\n\nIn the following text, we’ll take a closer look at two\n\n[other examples: XDSpy, an APT group that managed](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/10/02/xdspy-stealing-government-secrets-since-2011/)\n\nto stay under the radar for nine years, and Sandworm,\n\nwhich is one of the most dangerous APT groups\n\nin operation.\n\nWe’ll also discuss the role supply-chain attacks play in\n\nthe arsenals of various threat actors, a subject that has\n\nbeen grabbing even more attention than usual since\n\nthe SolarWinds hack made international headlines.\n\n\n###### Robert Lipovský\n\nSenior Malware Researcher\n\n\n-----\n\n###### XDSpy – Stealing government secrets since 2011\n\nProbably the most interesting characteristic of the XDSpy\n\nAPT group is that it went largely unnoticed for nine years.\n\nThis espionage group has been active since 2011, and its\n\n[activities were undocumented until an advisory from the](https://cert.by/?p=1458)\n\nBelarusian CERT in February 2020.\n\nOver the years, the group compromised many government\n\nentities, including militaries, Ministries of Foreign Affairs,\n\nand private companies in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.\n\nAccording to ESET telemetry, the targets of XDSpy were\n\nlocated in Belarus, Moldova, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine.\n\nIn terms of functionality and architecture, XDSpy uses\n\na typical cyberespionage toolset consisting of a main\n\ndownloader module that downloads additional plugins\n\nto carry out the desired actions. During our research, we\n\ndiscovered plugins used for exfiltrating files from the\n\nmain C: drive or from external drives, taking screenshots,\n\nand extracting saved passwords from various applications,\n\nsuch as web browsers and email programs. One of the\n\nplugins, called XDLoc, is used to gather nearby SSIDs\n\n(Wi-Fi access point names), most likely to geo-locate\n\nvictimized machines.\n\nXDSpy operators use spearphishing emails in order to\n\ncompromise their targets. The emails display a slight\n\nvariance, as some contain an attachment, while others\n\ncontain a link to a malicious file. The first layer of the\n\nmalicious file or attachment is generally a ZIP or RAR\n\narchive. At the end of June 2020, the operators stepped\n\nup their game by using a vulnerability in Internet Explorer,\n\nCVE-2020-0968.\n\n\nOf particular interest are two instances where the XDSpy\n\noperators used the COVID-19 theme in their spearphishing\n\ncampaigns. In February 2020, they spread the malware\n\nthrough an email stating that the first cases of COVID-19\n\nhad been discovered in Belarus, even though this was a\n\nfew weeks before the first official cases in the country\n\nwere actually registered. The following photograph of\n\nthe malicious email circulated on social networks as part\n\nof an unexpected disinformation campaign.\n\nThen, in September 2020, the operators used the official\n\nRussian government COVID-19 website rospotrebnadzor.\n\nru as a decoy to download XDDown, the main malware\n\ncomponent responsible for downloading additional plugins.\n\n###### Exaramel backdoor in France: Another Sandworm supply-chain attack?\n\nWhen it comes to the notorious Sandworm APT group,\n\ncertainly, the most significant news in the past six months\n\n[was the US Department of Justice indictment of six Russian](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/six-russian-gru-officers-charged-connection-worldwide-deployment-destructive-malware-and)\n\nGRU officers for their alleged roles in the group’s many\n\nattacks.\n\nAside from the geopolitical aspect, defenders should be\n\naware that, even though Sandworm’s most infamous\n\n[attacks were dated between 2015 (the first Ukrainian](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/11/blackenergy-and-the-ukrainian-power-outage-what-we-really-know/)\n\n_[power grid attacks) and 2018 (Olympic Destroyer), this](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/11/blackenergy-and-the-ukrainian-power-outage-what-we-really-know/)_\n\ndangerous group is still very much active in 2021.\n\nIn February 2021, France’s national information security\n\n[agency ANSSI released a report revealing an intrusion](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2021-CTI-005.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\ncampaign targeting the Centreon IT monitoring software,\n\nwhich resulted in the breach of a number of French\n\norganizations. The campaign lasted from 2017 until 2020\n\nand affected mostly IT providers, especially web hosting\n\nproviders. Two backdoors were discovered on compromised\n\nsystems: the P.A.S. webshell and (much more interestingly)\n\n[the Exaramel backdoor.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/10/11/new-telebots-backdoor-linking-industroyer-notpetya/)\n\nExaramel is the work of Sandworm (more specifically,\n\na subgroup that ESET tracks as TeleBots) and was the\n\npiece of evidence that allowed us to attribute the\n\n[infamous Industroyer to the same APT group, based on](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/12/industroyer-biggest-threat-industrial-control-systems-since-stuxnet/)\n\ncode similarities.\n\nWith the recent SolarWinds hack in mind, and the fact\n\nthat Sandworm is known for conducting supply-chain\n\n[attacks in the past—remember the M.E.Doc compromise](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/30/telebots-back-supply-chain-attacks-against-ukraine/)\n\nleading to the NotPetya outbreak?—the cybersecurity\n\nindustry was immediately curious about details of the\n\nCentreon compromise.\n\n[According to Centreon, the compromise was not the result](https://www.centreon.com/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/centreon-provides-clarification-following-the-publication-of-the-anssi-report/)\n\nof a supply-chain attack. Instead, the campaign exploited\n\ninstallations of out-of-date versions of its IT monitoring\n\nsoftware, not the company itself.\n\nThe fact that this was not a supply-chain attack is\n\na positive finding, as finding otherwise would indicate\n\na serious compromise with potentially far-reaching\n\nconsequences. However, another fact still remains true:\n\nOrganizations have been using vulnerable versions of\n\nCentreon IT monitoring software, and attackers have\n\ntaken advantage of that in order to compromise them.\n\n###### Future outlook\n\nThe past six months have shown that it’s business as\n\nusual for APT groups—including highly sophisticated ones\n\nlike Sandworm, less erudite (but still capable of staying\n\nunder the radar and likely achieving their goals) ones like\n\nXDSpy, and everything in between.\n\nSupply-chain attacks, while not all as earthshaking as\n\nthe SolarWinds hack (or other occurrences, such as the\n\nrecent Centreon case, that smell like supply-chain attacks\n\n\nbut actually aren’t), are becoming a major trend. In fact,\n\nin Q4 2020 alone, ESET uncovered likely as many supply\nchain attacks as the whole sector saw annually just a few\n\n[years back: the case of Lazarus abusing the WIZVERA](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/11/16/lazarus-supply-chain-attack-south-korea/)\n\n_[VeraPort software used by government and banking](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/11/16/lazarus-supply-chain-attack-south-korea/)_\n\nwebsites in South Korea; _[Operation StealthyTrident,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/10/luckymouse-ta428-compromise-able-desktop/)_\n\ncompromising the Able Desktop chat software used by\n\n[several Mongolian government agencies; and Operation](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/17/operation-signsight-supply-chain-attack-southeast-asia/)\n\n_[SignSight, compromising the distribution of signing](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/17/operation-signsight-supply-chain-attack-southeast-asia/)_\n\nsoftware distributed by the Vietnamese government.\n\n[More recently, in Q1 2021, ESET also uncovered Operation](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/02/01/operation-nightscout-supply-chain-attack-online-gaming-asia/)\n\n_[NightScout, a supply-chain attack targeting online](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/02/01/operation-nightscout-supply-chain-attack-online-gaming-asia/)_\n\ngaming communities.\n\nConsidering how difficult it is to detect and prevent\n\nsupply-chain attacks and how much APT actors and\n\ncybercriminals have to gain from them, the number of\n\nsuch attacks is only expected to grow in the near future,\n\nboth in Europe and globally.\n\nFor that reason, keep in mind the following\n\nrecommendations to reduce the risks that stem from\n\nvulnerable software supply chains:\n\n- Know your software—keep an inventory of all open\nsource and proprietary off-the-shelf tools used by your\n\norganization.\n\n- Keep an eye out for known vulnerabilities and apply\n\npatches as soon as they are available; indeed, attacks\n\ninvolving tainted updates should by no means\n\ndiscourage anybody from updating their software.\n\n- Stay alert for breaches impacting third-party\n\nsoftware vendors.\n\n- Drop redundant or outdated systems, services\n\nand protocols.\n\n- Assess your suppliers’ risks by developing an\n\nunderstanding of their security processes.\n\n- Set security requirements for your software suppliers.\n\n- Request regular code audits and inquire about security\n\nchecks, and change control procedures for\n\ncode components.\n\n- Inquire about penetration tests to identify\n\npotential hazards.\n\n- Request access controls and two-factor authentication\n\n(2FA) to safeguard software development processes\n\nand build pipelines.\n\n- Run security software with multiple layers\n\nof protection.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 3\n\n### IT SECURITY AND GOVERNMENT: PARALLELS BETWEEN TARGETED INSTITUTIONS\n\n\n###### To be CISO of a cybersecurity company is to be in a unique position. And, while there is inherent benefit in working with a board that intrinsically understands the technical aspects of security, cybersecurity companies are no less a target (indeed, they could be a prize) for cybercriminals. This second point, knowing we are a target, is where I believe our experience most strongly intersects with that of government organizations. This key point has remained constant over my 10 years as CISO at ESET and is a main driver in evolving our security posture to meet the ever-changing demands of the online environment.\n\nThe reality of our status as a target also has strong\n\nrelevance to our company’s security culture, growth\n\nand business model. Governments face a similar\n\nchallenge. They are clear targets, their adversaries\n\nwill not be readily eliminated, and mitigation of the\n\nworst symptoms of the tactics and techniques found\n\non the threatscape dictate everything from security\n\npolicy and resource allocation to culture and\n\nstrategic growth.\n\nQuestions about how to evolve can be answered\n\nboth from the point of view of ESET and from that\n\nof the wider information security world. Since I am\n\nmore intimately acquainted with ESET, it is far easier\n\n###### Daniel Chromek to address the “how” from that perspective. ESET is\n\na company whose business has grown quite\n\nCISO/Section Lead\n\ndramatically during my tenure. On the other hand,\n\nit is a close-knit community in which a lot of activities\n\nneeded standardization and a proper governance\n\nframework in order to streamline internal processes,\n\ncommunication and the exchange of information.\n\n\n###### to meet the ever-changing demands of the online environment.\n\n Daniel Chromek\n\nCISO/Section Lead\n\n\n-----\n\nIn particular, standardization and governance at ESET\n\nsupported us in shifting focus from protecting primarily\n\nconsumer and SMB clients toward enabling significant\n\ngrowth in the enterprise segment. It is this pursuit that\n\nhas added new pressure to document information\n\nsecurity, comply with distinct directives and regulations,\n\nand enhance our capabilities to address enterprise\n\ncustomers’ questions and reservations when implementing\n\nsecurity solutions in their environments. Categorically,\n\nall governments are facing rapid demand to digitize\n\nservices, improve internal processes—and to formalize\n\nboth through improved governance. Similar to the ESET\n\nexperience, the journey involved with formalization of\n\nprocesses (and culture) via governance reflects maturity\n\nand ambition to reach new markets; in the case of\n\ngovernments—improved growth, better service provision\n\nand national or local cohesion.\n\n###### Implications of maturation\n\nOf course, the challenges around governance were being\n\nfaced well before we reached our current level of\n\nmaturity—and with growth of the company, they have\n\nonly become more complex. As such, deploying security\n\ncontrols in a complex IT environment requires more time\n\nand more resources than before. Therefore, our internal\n\nsecurity section grew significantly and now consists of\n\nmultiple teams focusing on various aspects of security.\n\nSuffice to say that the internal security division needs to\n\nbe very well prepared, as presentations to management\n\ncan quickly morph into technical deep dives. The last\n\ntime we had this type of deep dive, it was related to our\n\nvulnerability management tool’s risk score parameter\n\nand the formula behind it so that management could\n\nunderstand whether it was suitable for reporting. This\n\nincluded a debate on how the presence of an exploit in\n\nmalware kits can raise the risk score above traditional\n\nCVSS scores. Whether it was 12 years ago when I joined\n\nthe co-founders in discussing our security policies or\n\ntoday, going deep remains a cultural phenomenon deeply\n\nrooted at ESET.\n\nOf course, even before I took on the CISO role, we had\n\nmany very skillful employees and needed to balance\n\n\nsecurity and visibility against the “Big Brother” worries\n\nheld by our colleagues. ESET’s owners were privacy-aware\n\nand remain so. We also understood early on the possible\n\nimpact on staff morale. So, we agreed to configure ESET\n\nculture early on as that of a positive security company,\n\npersuading everyone, including management, that using\n\nfear, uncertainty and doubt tactics simply do not work\n\nand could result in losing the respect of colleagues across\n\nthe organization.\n\nI raise this because all of us, you and I included, face\n\na similar choice: balancing security and visibility with\n\nanother component—trust. This need became painfully\n\n[clear in 2020, the year that gave us COVID-19 and that](https://www.eset.com/blog/enterprise/ciso-interview-how-the-pandemic-helped-us-meet-the-needs-of-our-employees/)\n\ntransported ESET, and likely all of us, to a security future\n\nfew of us entirely expected. To succeed in security in the\n\nCOVIDian era, a few basics have to be done right. These\n\ngo beyond trust and include the practical aspects of\n\nsecurity that need minding by CISOs in 2021. Please find\n\nmine below:\n\n**1. Keep basic principles running**\n\n**in work-from-home mode**\n\n“Getting back to basics” is always good advice in\n\ninformation security. It also applies to 2021, when we\n\nhopefully enter a post-COVID world. Patching, backups\n\nand endpoint protection are areas that are important\n\nregardless of where employees work, whether in the\n\noffice or from home. Expansion and management of staff\n\nVPN accounts to provide more secure access to an\n\norganization’s platforms, along with many other\n\nprecautions, are here to stay. Considering a Zero Trust\n\nsecurity approach or a “trust but verify” narrative might\n\nbe helpful when addressing remote work specifics. Keep\n\nan eye on these and look to optimize.\n\n**2. Grow the organization in regulated areas**\n\nWhile I can only speak for ESET, we see accelerated growth\n\nin security-related regulations all over the world. This will\n\nlikely increase exponentially with the already rapid\n\ndigitization being accelerated by COVID. For example, the\n\n[NIS Directive (and the NIS2 Directive) impacts both ESET](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_BRI(2021)689333)\n\nas a cybersecurity provider and many of ESET’s clients,\n\nespecially those in regulated industries or those that\n\nprovide direct services to government. So, it makes sense\n\nthat we engage together to create shared approaches.\n\n\n-----\n\nJust last year, amid rolling COVID lockdowns, ESET and\n\nits products entered new regulatory territory with the\n\nlaunch of our cloud services like ESET PROTECT Cloud.\n\nThis brought its own complexities, with ESET again\n\nneeding to comply with the NIS Directive and ESET’s\n\npartners having to navigate local laws regulating the use\n\nof cloud-based security software. So, while having to\n\ncomply with a single regulation like the NIS Directive may\n\nnot be pleasant, it is still a more straightforward task than\n\naligning with multiple regulations and standards required\n\nby government, industry and enterprise customers.\n\nTo face these challenges, a good approach is to establish\n\nan information security management system (e.g., ISO\n\n27001) to manage your core information security\n\nprocesses and then systematically add the rest of the\n\nsecurity controls you need to bring your organization up\n\nto speed with compliance. ISO 27001, as well as the\n\nBuilding Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM), can help\n\norganizations develop and maintain good documentation\n\nof their security management system and internal\n\ncontrols, which is a must to prove compliance.\n\n**3.** **Balance resources to support various business**\n\n**initiatives while preserving team sanity**\n\nI believe we struggle with this point as an industry. Likely,\n\nthe main problem faced by any mature security program\n\nis its relationship with so many activities within the\n\norganization; simply, it is difficult to give priority to the\n\ntruly important activities. Reporting and measurement\n\nadd another level of complexity—we should track risks,\n\naudit findings and incidents; gather feedback and lessons\n\nlearned; identify compliance gaps; etc., even though\n\nsometimes it feels like we are being asked to compare\n\nwhat is incomparable. This same challenge is certainly\n\nrelevant for government organizations too as they strive\n\nto strike a balance between the security of internal\n\nmechanisms and external services with reporting—all of\n\nwhich needs to be both compliant and functioning practically.\n\nBut there are at least two ways to achieve equilibrium.\n\nThe first is by way of business priority. If business can\n\nidentify their priorities, then it is easy to shift internal\n\nsecurity resources to them. If, however, business cannot\n\nidentify their priorities (whether overall or compared\n\nwith other business unit priorities), the key to finding\n\n\na solution seems to be by asking the following questions:\n\nWhat is the risk? What is the risk if our security team\n\ncannot dedicate resources to support the business\n\ninitiative? What is the risk that a particular audit’s finding\n\nwon’t be closed? What is the risk of…you name it! Risk\n\ncan be used as a single measure of determining the\n\npriority of competing activities.\n\n**4. Increase the maturity**\n\n**of your software development life cycle**\n\nIn the enterprise world, it is quite common to have both\n\ninternal and outsourced development teams that build,\n\ncustomize and maintain critical systems, products or\n\nservices. A problem that can thus arise in the face of\n\nmultiple security standards being used in the software\n\ndevelopment life cycle is the expectation of applying\n\na waterfall model. However, with a strong push on rapid\n\nagile development and deployment ongoing in the\n\nindustry, it is simply not viable to apply a waterfall\n\napproach to DevOps activities any longer.\n\nESET’s approach is to define DevOps security activities,\n\nrelated to both development and operations, and to\n\nengage in patient discussion with development teams\n\nas to how to include these activities in their methodologies\n\nand work procedures. The goal: to identify what should\n\nbe delivered by internal security experts, versus security\n\nchampions within the diversity of development teams,\n\nand how to automate as much as possible.\n\n**5. Prepare and respond to the**\n\n**growing complexity of attacks**\n\n[Looking at Verizon’s data breach reports over the years](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/)\n\nclearly suggests that attacks are getting worse. We don’t\n\nknow what kind of vulnerabilities may be exploited next,\n\nwhat kind of tools attackers will use, or what their goals\n\nare. But what we can do is to prepare for them: both\n\ntechnically, via layered controls, and organizationally, with\n\nincident response team capability, skills and overall maturity.\n\nThe situation brought on by COVID-19 has been a good\n\nreminder of how quickly things can change. The\n\naccelerations COVID brought to ESET are likely similar\n\nto those experienced by other organizations. My chief\n\ntakeaways from this experience would be:\n\n\n-----\n\n- To put more focus on asset categorization and endpoint\n\nvisibility as employees are working from home, outside\n\nof an organization’s on-premises network.\n\n- If leveraging cloud-based services, to prioritize proper\n\nconfiguration, access management and resource\n\nallocation, among other cloud security measures.\n\nFrom our own experience, we’ve noticed a clear growth in\n\nattacks, especially Business Email Compromise (BEC), that\n\ndemanded more of our attention than usual. We are lucky,\n\nas our endpoint portfolio includes a solid anti-malware\n\n[engine, a cloud-managed sandboxing solution—ESET](https://www.eset.com/int/business/solutions/cloud-sandbox-analysis/)\n\n_[Dynamic Threat Defense—against emerging threats, and an](https://www.eset.com/int/business/solutions/cloud-sandbox-analysis/)_\n\n[endpoint detection and response solution—ESET Enterprise](https://www.eset.com/int/business/solutions/endpoint-detection-and-response/)\n\n_[Inspector—that provides a ton of visibility into endpoints and](https://www.eset.com/int/business/solutions/endpoint-detection-and-response/)_\n\nboosts our incident response capabilities. Furthermore, we\n\nalso have an easy-to-use Data Loss Prevention solution via\n\nour technology alliance with Safetica.\n\n\n###### Targeted but diligent\n\nYes, we remain targeted, but having a solid foundation,\n\nincluding the components mentioned above and a deep\n\nfocus on governance, enables us to focus on specific\n\nproblems like forensic evidence, and gathering and\n\nreworking these findings into our own products. This is\n\nwhere our expertise in malware research most clearly\n\nintersects with product development. Using ESET\n\nEnterprise Inspector in combination with our core\n\ndetection technologies, we can simultaneously protect\n\nthe business and constantly evolve our systems, culture\n\nand processes to meet the challenges of the moment.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 4\n\n### EMISSARYSOLDIER: MALICIOUS ACTIVITIES OF LUCKYMOUSE APT GROUP IN 2020\n\n\n###### LuckyMouse has compromised government networks and private companies (telco, media and banks) in Central Asia and the Middle East\n\nLuckyMouse, also known as APT27 and Emissary\n\nPanda, is a cyberespionage group that is best known\n\nfor its regular use of watering hole, or strategic web\n\ncompromise, attacks. The group has breached not\n\nonly multiple government networks in Central Asia\n\nand the Middle East, but also transnational\n\norganizations such as the International Civil Aviation\n\nOrganization (ICAO).\n\nIn its latest analysis of LuckyMouse, ESET Research\n\ndiscovered a set of malicious activities that took\n\nplace in 2020 and in which the operators mainly\n\nused the SysUpdate (aka Soldier) toolkit. ESET has\n\nnamed this set of activities EmissarySoldier.\n\n###### Matthieu Faou\n\nIn order to compromise victims, LuckyMouse\n\nMalware Researcher\n\ntypically uses watering holes, compromising\n\nwebsites likely to be visited by its intended targets.\n\nLuckyMouse operators also perform network scans\n\nto find vulnerable internet-facing servers run by\n\ntheir intended victims. While the group generally\n\nuses already known exploits to compromise\n\nunpatched servers, ESET saw LuckyMouse among\n\nthe threat groups likely leveraging the Microsoft\n\nExchange vulnerabilities while they were still zero\n\ndays to conduct attacks on email servers.\n\n\n###### Matthieu Faou\n\nMalware Researcher\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce LuckyMouse operators gain a foothold on a machine,\n\nthey will deploy one of their custom post-compromise\n\nimplants, SysUpdate or HyperBro. An interesting similarity\n\namong their toolkits is that they all employ DLL search\n\norder hijacking to thwart detection.\n\n\ncode execution vulnerabilities were found in this application.\n\nWhile ESET doesn’t have proof that these exploits were\n\nused, we did observe LuckyMouse components being\n\ndeployed through the internet information services (IIS)\n\ninstance that was also serving Microsoft SharePoint.\n\n\nimage: According to ESET telemetry, LuckyMouse targeted the following entities in 2020\n\n\nThe Middle East is currently a hotbed for many espionage\n\ngroups, and LuckyMouse has been very active there as\n\nwell. It is very common to find multiple threat actors on\n\nthe same machine or at least in the same network. In\n\nthis region, LuckyMouse predominately focuses on\n\ngovernmental entities. The operators are probably trying\n\nto obtain insights about the current geopolitical situation.\n\nOn the contrary, most of their targets in Central Asia are\n\nprivate companies (telco, media and banks). This shows\n\na strategic interest in the economic situation of the region.\n\nLuckyMouse maintains a quite large network infrastructure\n\nwith VPN nodes, staging nodes and command and control\n\n(C&C) nodes. During the EmissarySoldier campaign, ESET\n\nobserved 16 different staging and C&C nodes.\n\nESET researchers also noticed that some of the compromised\n\nmachines were running Microsoft SharePoint, which was\n\nreachable from the internet. In 2019 and 2020, several remote\n\n\nLuckyMouse has a specific way of installing its implants—\n\nusing a so-called trident model—in its SysUpdate toolkit.\n\nThe trident model features a legitimate application\n\nvulnerable to DLL hijacking, a custom DLL that loads the\n\npayload, and a raw Shikata Ga Nai-encoded binary payload.\n\n**Overview of the trident model**\n\nTypical of many financially motivated—but also espionage—\n\nthreat actors, LuckyMouse employs offensive security\n\ntools. Thus, while the group mainly uses custom backdoors,\n\nESET researchers have seen several other tools in some\n\nintrusions, including:\n\n- JuicyPotato, a privilege escalation tool;\n\n- Mimikatz, a tool to extract various Windows secrets,\n\nincluding passwords; and\n\n- nbtscan, a NetBIOS scanner.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe SysUpdate toolkit itself, which was the focus of this\n\nlatest deep dive into LuckyMouse activity, is relatively\n\nnew, with the first samples having been discovered in\n\n2018. Since then, the toolkit has been through various\n\ndevelopment stages. In contrast with previous samples,\n\nthose used in 2020 showed major improvements and\n\nadded functionalities, including the implementation of\n\nmultiple C&C communication protocols and small\n\nrefactoring of already implemented features.\n\nSysUpdate components are divided into a set of binaries,\n\neach with a specific operational purpose. In particular,\n\nthe trident model components of SysUpdate consist of\n\na benign application like GUP.exe, which acts as the initial\n\nloader for the next component, a DLL, which in turn acts\n\nas a loader for the next component, the Stage 1 payload\n\nitself. These three components are dropped to an\n\narbitrary location on initial access to a compromised\n\nsystem, a pattern that seemed to be recurrent in the\n\nactivity monitored across different victims located in\n\ndifferent regions.\n\nAs the SysUpdate toolkit is highly modular, it gives its\n\noperators the flexibility to provide malicious capabilities\n\non demand, as well as pull back and limit the exposure\n\nof malicious artifacts at will. For this very reason, ESET\n\nresearchers did not retrieve any malicious modules, and\n\nthey expect this to be a recurrent challenge in analyzing\n\nfuture operations that employ SysUpdate. The best way\n\n\nof tracking down such a slippery customer is by deploying\n\nan endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution that\n\ncan identify suspicious events happening in a network.\n\nLuckyMouse was increasingly active throughout 2020,\n\nseemingly going through a retooling process in which\n\nvarious features were being incrementally integrated\n\ninto the SysUpdate toolkit. This may be an indicator that\n\nthe threat actors behind LuckyMouse are gradually\n\nshifting from using HyperBro to SysUpdate.\n\n_[HyperBro is a much older toolkit that has caught](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0398/)_\n\nsignificantly more attention from the threat intelligence\n\ncommunity in recent years, with considerable evidence\n\nsuggesting it has also been adopted by several APT\n\ngroups. On the other hand, SysUpdate has not received\n\nmuch attention, with few public reports mentioning\n\nit—most likely, it has only been deployed in a relatively\n\nsmall number of operations.\n\nMonitoring LuckyMouse and the tools used in its recent\n\ncampaigns remains a priority. A reminder of why occurred\n\njust as ESET researchers were wrapping up this investigation,\n\n[with the threat group leveraging vulnerabilities in Microsoft](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/)\n\n_[Exchange to attack email servers and install the SysUpdate](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/)_\n\ntoolkit. This point of intersection provides a strong case for\n\ngovernments and business alike to tighten up security on\n\ninternet-facing servers, further collaborate on security\n\nstrategy, and build capacity and maturity in the use of\n\nEDR tools.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 5\n\n### REGULATORY RADAR: CRITICAL CUES FOR CYBERSECURITY POSTURE IN THE EU AND US\n\n\n###### Society’s reliance on technology, and the emergence of those who seek to misuse it, have led to increasing attempts by governments around the globe to regulate cyberspace. In doing so, governments are broadly attempting to deter bad actors, both state-sponsored and criminal, through powers to pursue and levy penalties; protect critical national infrastructure, personal information, security and defense assets; and build societal resilience by ensuring government bodies, businesses and other organizations recognize their responsibilities and are held accountable. In parallel, governments aim to educate citizens as to the scope of cybersecurity risks and needed mitigations.\n\nAt a supranational level, the United Nations is trying\n\nto secure agreement on the application of international\n\nlaw to state activity and build on 11 norms of responsible\n\nbehavior in cyberspace agreed in 2015. The European\n\nUnion’s 2018 GDPR regulation quickly became\n\na reference point for countries seeking to strengthen\n\nprivacy and security regulation. Both the EU and US\n\n(under the new Biden administration) are expected to\n\nset the tone for the increased regulation of cyberspace\n\nin the years ahead.\n\n###### Andy Garth\n\nIn the absence of a global standard or agreement, the\n\nGovernment Affairs Lead\n\nregulatory picture is rather fragmented. Presently,\n\nregulation is predominately driven at the national, state\n\nand industry sector levels. This fact, combined with\n\nthe pace of innovation and legislative complexities, has\n\nleft most governments with palpable security\n\nchallenges and many struggling to keep up.\n\n\n###### Andy Garth\n\nGovernment Affairs Lead\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven the broad scope of cyberspace and differences in\n\nnational approaches, for brevity, CISOs and policy makers\n\nshould keep an eye on the following areas to identify\n\ncritical cues for future compliance and security posture.\n\n###### European Union: NIS2 Directive\n\nIn December 2020, the EU published the draft text of the\n\nNIS2 Directive, which significantly expands the number\n\nof entities and sectors required to take strengthened\n\nmeasures to enhance cybersecurity. The text is currently\n\nprogressing through the legislative scrutiny process.\n\nOnce a final text is agreed, on member states will have\n\n18 months to implement the directive. The impacts will\n\nbe felt in the EU and beyond. **The proposed NIS2**\n\n**Directive will:**\n\n- Introduce more stringent supervisory measures;\n\n- Impose stricter enforcement requirements, including\n\nharmonized sanctions regimes across member states;\n\n- Establish information sharing and cooperation on\n\ncyber-crisis management at national and EU levels;\n\n- Mandate the creation of national strategies that ensure\n\nthe resilience of critical entities;\n\n- Obligate the carrying out of national risk assessments;\n\nand\n\n- Aim to strengthen the security of supply chains.\n\nWhen adopted, the NIS2 Directive will apply alongside\n\nsector-specific legislation, such as the proposed “Directive\n\non the Resilience of Critical Entities.” This sector-specific\n\ndirective aims to protect critical infrastructure and will\n\ncomplement the NIS2 Directive to the extent in which\n\nit will likely impose cybersecurity risk management and\n\nnotification obligations of at least an equivalent effect\n\nto the obligations set out in the NIS2 Directive.\n\n\n###### European Union: Cybersecurity Certification\n\nThe EU Cybersecurity Act of 2019, now in force, granted\n\na permanent mandate to the EU Agency for Cybersecurity\n\n(ENISA), including the new key role of setting up and\n\nmaintaining a cybersecurity certification framework.\n\nThis framework will provide EU-wide certification\n\nschemes with a comprehensive set of rules, technical\n\nrequirements, standards, and procedures, providing\n\nassurance to users based on the level of conformity with\n\nthe agreed requirements.\n\nFurther, these certification schemes represent agreements\n\nat the EU level on the evaluation of the security properties\n\nof information and communications technology (ICT)\n\nproducts or services. Briefly, these will attest ICT products\n\nand services in terms of:\n\n- categories of products and services covered;\n\n- cybersecurity requirements;\n\n- the type of evaluation; and\n\n- the intended level of assurance.\n\nENISA and the European Commission will be assisted\n\nand advised by:\n\n- European Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG);\n\n- the Stakeholder Cybersecurity Certification Group\n\n(SCCG); and\n\n- European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and\n\nResearch Competence Centre (ECCC).\n\nIn particular, the ECCC is expected to become the main\n\ninstrument for investing in cybersecurity research, high\n\ntech and innovation. This overall mission will feed into\n\nthe following objectives:\n\n**1.** Carry out procurement of products and solutions.\n\n**2.** Provide financial support and technical assistance to\n\nstart-ups and SMEs.\n\n**3.** Support research and innovation based on\n\na comprehensive research agenda.\n\n**4.** Drive high cybersecurity standards, especially in the\n\nfield of skills development.\n\n**5.** Facilitate cooperation between civil and defense\n\nspheres with regard to dual technologies (in relation\n\nto the European Defence Fund).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Tony Anscombe\n\nChief Security Evangelist\n\n\n###### US privacy regulations and evolving cybersecurity laws\n\nFollowing the EU’s enactment of GDPR in 2018,\n\nimplementation of data privacy regulations also began\n\nto gain pace at the state government level in the United\n\nStates. Legislators in California passed the California\n\nConsumer Privacy Act in 2018 (CCPA) and implemented\n\nit in 2020. At the end of 2020, California’s Proposition 24\n\nwas passed, meaning the California Privacy Rights Act\n\n(CPRA) will become effective in 2023. The CPRA makes\n\nsignificant additions to the CCPA—which itself could be\n\nseen as falling short of GDPR in some areas, although in\n\nothers it went further. These include:\n\n- the concept of household data in addition to merely\n\nindividual data as emphasized in the GDPR;\n\n- extending protection to Californian residents even\n\nwhen outside the state for temporary or transitory\n\npurposes;\n\n- the right to opt out of the sale of personal data to\n\nthird parties. Companies must include a “Do Not Sell\n\nMy Personal Information” link on website home pages.\n\nWhile similar protections exist under the GDPR, they\n\nare less clear—a data subject needs to opt out of\n\nmarketing purposes and additionally withdraw consent\n\nfor processing activities.\n\nWith broad agreement on the need for federal consumer\n\nprivacy legislation realized in the Consumer Online\n\nPrivacy Rights Act (COPRA) in April 2020 and the Biden\n\nadministration’s apparent recognition of the need for\n\nfederal privacy legislation, we will likely see a host of\n\n\ninitiatives. Indeed, Vice President Kamala Harris has\n\na strong record in privacy enforcement, as witnessed by\n\nthe amended and strengthened California Online Privacy\n\nProtection Act (CalOPPA) during Harris’s time as\n\nCalifornia’s state attorney general. Also, several Obama\nera staffers who contributed to the consumer bill are\n\nback in the driving seat.\n\nAs the pandemic continues, there will likely be considerable\n\nfocus on healthcare providers and agencies that have been\n\nparty to contact tracing, testing and vaccination. Currently,\n\nsome of the processes for collection of personal data may\n\nnot be as scrutinized due to urgency and medical need. It\n\nshould be expected, however, that this latitude will likely\n\nbe removed and the cybersecurity requirements for such\n\ndata will be strengthened and enforced.\n\nThis is also true globally, where the internet creates an\n\nenvironment that breaks down international barriers,\n\ngiven that everything is accessible in the same cloud.\n\nPrivacy legislation is not a set and done process; it’s an\n\nevolving process that is likely to require continual\n\nmodification, especially when considering new\n\ntechnologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet\n\nof Things and other advancements in technology. There\n\nis a need for standardization and harmonization within\n\nand among states, countries, and continents across the\n\nglobe. All consumers should be awarded the same data\n\nprivacy rights by companies and organizations regardless\n\nof their location. Privacy legislation is undoubtedly a topic\n\nthat will remain a priority for legislators.\n\n###### Cybersecurity laws in the US\n\nWhile there are all-encompassing cybersecurity laws in\n\nthe US, typically legislation is dependent on the sector\n\nof a business or organization, although some legislation\n\naimed at specific technologies crosses the boundaries of\n\nmultiple industry sectors.\n\nSome of the leading sector-specific US legislation related\n\nto cybersecurity includes:\n\n- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability\n\nAct (HIPPA);\n\n- Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act;\n\n- Dodd-Frank Act; and\n\n- IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act.\n\n\n-----\n\n- Consumer Privacy Protection Act 2017—requires\n\ncompanies to secure personal information and provide\n\nnotifications on data breaches.\n\n- Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA)—allows\n\nsharing of internet traffic between gov’t and tech\n\ncompanies for cybersecurity threat reasons.\n\n- Federal Information Security Management Act\n\n(FISMA)—requires government agencies to have\n\npolicies, standards and guidelines on information\n\nsecurity.\n\nAn example of sector-specific legislation is the HIPPA,\n\nwhich requires healthcare organizations to protect\n\npersonally identifiable information from fraud and theft,\n\nand to address limitation in healthcare insurance\n\ncoverage. In the financial industry, organizations are\n\nrequired to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act\n\nand the Dodd-Frank Act, which stipulates there must be\n\npolicy in place to protect information from security\n\nthreats and issues with data integrity.\n\nIn fact, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Consumer Financial\n\nProtection Bureau has authority to socialize potential\n\nnew rules. Accordingly, in autumn of 2020, the bureau\n\nissued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which\n\nwill likely result in changes in the near future to the\n\nmethods of consumer-authorized access to data and the\n\nlevel of data security required under the law.\n\n\n###### IoT\n\nFinally, the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2020,\n\nwhich applies across sectors, requires the National\n\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to publish\n\nstandards and guidelines for federal agencies on the\n\nappropriate use of IoT devices in government systems.\n\nThis piece of IoT legislation consists of a stepped timeline\n\nthat requires agencies to:\n\n- agree on how to address and disclose vulnerabilities\n\nof devices in use;\n\n- set minimum information security requirements for\n\nmanaging cybersecurity risks; and\n\n- review and revise guidelines and standards every\n\nfive years.\n\nThe final component takes effect in December 2022 and\n\nwill prohibit use of IoT devices that do not comply with\n\nthe NIST standards and guidelines.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 6\n\n### ENDPOINT DETECTION AND RESPONSE: A COUNTERBALANCE TO PERSISTENT THREATS\n\n\n###### Large organizations and government institutions, such as ministries of foreign affairs, embassies and other diplomatic representatives, are prime targets for espionage operations. Threat actors target these institutions in various ways to steal sensitive information. Stealth is an essential part of these malicious campaigns because remaining unseen and undetected in a target network for as long as possible is key for success.\n\n\nEndpoint detection and response (EDR) technology\n\ncan help large organizations detect stealthy threat\n\nactors by flagging suspicious behaviors, especially\n\nwhen they employ fully undetected malware or\n\nlegitimate tools. EDRs can generate alerts upon\n\nexecution of unpopular applications or legitimate\n\ntools known to be abused by attackers—for\n\nexample, so-called living-off-the-land binaries\n\n(LOLBins)—thus allowing defenders to see and\n\ninvestigate suspicious activities happening in\n\ntheir networks.\n\n_[Invisimole, a threat actor ESET researchers have](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/06/18/digging-up-invisimole-hidden-arsenal/)_\n\nbeen tracking for a few years, bears out its name,\n\nas it targets high-profile organizations for\n\nespionage purposes and deploys various strategies\n\nin order to be as difficult as possible to detect.\n\n\nOnce Invisimole’s operators have a foothold in an\n\norganization, they typically set up different\n\npersistence chains to ensure continued access.\n\nHowever, although different chains exist, they\n\nhave one point in common: No malicious code is\n\npresent on disk.\n\nFurther, Invisimole’s operators abuse legitimate\n\ntools to load and decrypt, in memory, malicious\n\ntools that enable their espionage activities. The\n\nusage of these legitimate tools makes it hard for\n\nstandard detection technologies to detect\n\nanomalies. In these cases, in which stealth is the\n\nultimate goal, defenders relying on a properly\n\nconfigured EDR solution can detect such malicious\n\nactivities and correctly mitigate attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 7\n\n### ENDPOINT DETECTION AND RESPONSE AT ESET\n\n\n###### WHAT IS ENDPOINT DETECTION AND RESPONSE?\n\n Endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions collect and analyze large amounts of data generated from activity on endpoints. Suspicious behaviors produce an alarm that alerts security professionals to further investigate and potentially discover any attacks that would otherwise go unnoticed. ESET developed ESET Enterprise Inspector (EEI) as an EDR solution capable of protecting both Windows and macOS endpoints.\n\n\n###### MITRE ATT&CK®\n\nESET Enterprise Inspector references its detections\n\nto the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base of adversarial\n\ntactics, techniques and procedures, which provides\n\ncomprehensive information about the most\n\ncomplex threats and adversary groups afflicting\n\ncyberspace. With over 20 contributions to the\n\nknowledge base and having participated in the\n\n[third MITRE Engenuity ATT&CK Evaluations, our EDR](https://attackevals.mitre-engenuity.org/enterprise/carbanak_fin7/)\n\nsolution is battle tested and mature.\n\n###### Threat hunting\n\nPackaged with a set of rigorously tested rules to\n\ndetect suspicious behaviors and with advanced\n\nfiltering capabilities to sort data based on file\n\npopularity, reputation, signature, behavior and\n\n\nother contextual information, EEI offers automated\n\nand easy threat hunting capable of discovering\n\ntargeted attacks. Since EEI allows the creation of\n\ncustom rules, and rule exclusions, it can be fine\ntuned to make it best suited for an environment\n\nor to re-scan the events database with custom\n\nconfigurations for historic threat hunting.\n\n###### Public API\n\nESET Enterprise Inspector features an API that\n\nallows security engineers to export detections,\n\nthus allowing effective integration with tools such\n\nas SIEM, SOAR, ticketing and other tools.\n\n\n-----\n\n### ABOUT ESET\n\nFor more than 30 years, ESET® has been developing industry-leading IT security software and services\n\nto protect businesses, critical infrastructure and consumers worldwide from increasingly sophisticated\n\ndigital threats.
