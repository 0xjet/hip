In this paper, we perform a thorough study on the risks im-**\nposed by the globally accessible Android Clipboard. Based on the risk\nassessment, we formulate a series of attacks and categorize them into\ntwo groups, i.e., manipulation and stealing. Clipboard data manipulation may lead to common code injection attacks, like JavaScript injection\nand command injection. Furthermore, it can also cause phishing attacks,\nincluding web phishing and app phishing. Data stealing happens when\nsensitive data copied into the clipboard is accessed by malicious applications. For each category of attack, we analyze a large number of candidate\napps and show multiple case studies to demonstrate its feasibility. Also,\nour app analysis process is formulated to benefit future app development\nand vulnerability detection. After a comprehensive exposure of the risk,\nwe briefly discuss some potential solutions.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nAndroid was developed by Google in 2008 and officially took over as the mobile\nmarket leader in the fourth quarter of 2010 [23]. One reason for its rapid growth\nis the availability of a wide range of feature-rich applications (known as apps).\nDifferent from Apple, Google does not impose a thorough scrutinizing process on\napplications submitting to the official Android market (known as Google Play).\nMoreover, Google allows the existence of numerous alternative 3rd-party app\nstores. While this strategy has been proven to be successful and resulted in\ntoday’s dominance of Android platform, it also puts some system components,\ni.e., Clipboard in this paper, under risk.\n\n**Security risks on Android Clipboard.** The most interesting characteristic\nof Android Clipboard is its globally accessible nature, i.e., everything placed\non the clipboard is public and accessible to all the running apps on the device\nwithout any permission requirements or user interactions. Android even allows\napps to monitor data changes on the clipboard by registering a callback listener\nto the system. This is not a severe security problem on the desktop environment,\nsince its clipboard is user-driven and a window should transfer data to or from\nthe clipboard only in response to a command from the user [1].\nIn contrast, Android considers each app as a different user with different\nprivilege. Due to the global unguarded access, various users, i.e., apps, can arbitrarily operate on Android Clipboard without any restriction. What makes the\n\n\n-----\n\n2 Attacks on Android Clipboard\n\nsituation worse is the limited screen size of mobile devices. First of all, users\nare much more likely to copy and paste data on mobile devices to save typing\nefforts. Furthermore, fewer characters will be visible to users after pasting the\ncontent from the clipboard to the app, easing attackers’ effort in hiding their attacks. Another advantage for attackers targeting Android Clipboard is the lack\nof security consideration in common app development.\n\n**Our findings.** To understand the current security situation on Android Clipboard, we have conducted the first systematic study of the clipboard usage in\nbenign apps and malicious apps. Our malware sample [24] consists of 3,987 malware apps collected from different sources [3]. The benign sample consists of the\ntop 500 free apps in each category in Google Play (around 16,000 apps), and\nthey were collected in July 2012.\n\nOur analysis result shows that 1180 benign apps provide the functionality\nto put data on the clipboard, while 8 malware apps try to retrieve data from\nthe clipboard. Due to the open access, those 8 malware apps could easily steal\nwhatever information leaked from the mentioned benign apps. At the same time,\nwe also find that 384 benign apps can get data from the clipboard. However,\naround 60 malware apps are capable of manipulating the data on the clipboard.\nIf a benign app takes the clipboard data for execution without proper checking,\nany one of the 60 malware apps could possibly launch the code injection attacks.\n\nBased on the risk assessment, we have formulated a series of attacks and categorized them into two groups, i.e., manipulation and stealing. Clipboard data\nmanipulation may lead to code injection attacks, like JavaScript injection and\ncommand injection. For the JavaScript injection case, we first analyzed popular\nAndroid browser apps, and our result shows that 9 out of 11 are vulnerable.\nIn our study, we also found one vulnerable Samsung app, which takes search\nstring from users and append it to internal JavaScript code for execution without proper validations. If the search string is pasted from the infected clipboard,\nmalicious apps can potentially interfere with the future behavior of the vulnerable Samsung app. For the command injection case, we have studied 6 popular\nterminal apps available on Google Play, and all of them blindly take commands\nfrom clipboard without any scrutinizing. Another group of attack is data stealing,\nwhich happens when sensitive data is copied to the clipboard. To demonstrate\nthe severity of the attack, we have conducted case studies on three main types\nof sensitive data on the mobile device: Contacts, Calendar and Messages. For\neach category, we are able to identify several vulnerable apps.\n\n**Roadmap. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a short**\ntutorial on Android Clipboard. Section 3 formulates the attack models. While\nSection 4 discusses JavaScript injection attack, Section 5 focuses on command\ninjection attacks. Section 6 discusses the phishing attack. Data leakage attack is\nexplained in Section 7. Section 8 proposes and briefly discusses several potential\nsolutions. Finally, Section 9 describes the related work and Section 10 concludes.\n\n\n-----\n\nAttacks on Android Clipboard 3\n\n## 2 Short Tutorial on Android Clipboard\n\nOn Android platform, the clipboard is a powerful framework to support various\ntypes of data copy and paste within an app as well as among apps. To copy\ncertain type of data, a corresponding clip object (ClipData) is constructed and\nplaced on the clipboard if the required permission is granted to the app. The\nclipboard holds only one clip object at a time. When an app puts a clip object on\nthe clipboard, the previous clip object is erased. To paste data, the app retrieves\nthe clip object and selectively handles the resolved data based on its MIME type.\nDifferent from copying data to the clipboard, no permissions are required for an\napp to access the content from the Clipboard. Moreover, apps can even monitor\nprimary clip changes by registering a listener callback.\n_ClipManager is responsible for managing the copying, monitoring and pasting_\noperations on the clipboard. Applications can simply access the ClipManager\nwithout requiring any specific permission, as shown in the following example:\n\n1 `ClipboardManager mClipboard = (ClipboardManager)`\n2 `getSystemService(Context.CLIPBOARD_SERVICE);`\n\n## 3 Threat Models\n\nThe attacks discussed in this paper are categorized into two models based on\nthe operations performed by malicious applications on the clipboard data, i.e.,\nmanipulation and stealing. This section will give a high-level overview of these\ntwo models (depicted in Figure 1), leaving the attack details to later sections.\n\n**Fig. 1. Threat Models**\n\n**Manipulation.** We study how malicious apps can interfere with other apps’\nexecution by manipulating the data on the clipboard. In this attack model, we\nassume that the malicious app is installed on the same device as the victim app.\n\n\n-----\n\n4 Attacks on Android Clipboard\n\nThe assumption is not very difficult to satisfy. Actually any app potentially can\nperform the attack, since it does not require any permission to access the clipboard on Android. The malicious app keeps monitoring the data change on the\nclipboard. Once the copying operation is performed either by some other benign\napps or the user, the malicious app can selectively manipulate the data. When\nthe modified data is pasted to the same or another app and that app’s future\nbehavior depends on the pasted data, the attack succeeds. For web-based apps,\nattacker can try to inject JavaScript to achieve various damages (Section 4). For\nterminal apps, malicious commands may be injected to local/remote server for\nexecution (Section 5). The attacker can even perform phishing attacks on social\nwebsites as well as their applications (Section 6).\n\n**Stealing. We study how malicious apps can steal user’s private information,**\nwhich leads to data leakage attacks. The assumption for this threat model is\nthe same as the previous one. However, instead of manipulating the data, the\nattacker tries to detect user’s private data on the clipboard and steals it (Section 7). The attack will cause more damage if the data on this clipboard is a\nURI or Intent, which serves as an identifier to user’s private information, such as\nContacts, Calendar or Messages. Although this may sound less likely to happen,\nthe above requirement is not difficult to achieve at all. Firstly, it is not rare for\nusers to copy their username or even password to the clipboard. Secondly, many\napps available on Google Play allow users to perform private data copying and\npasting, leaving plenty of attacking opportunities for malicious apps.\n\n## 4 Injection Attacks - JavaScript\n\n**4.1** **JavaScript on Mobile Browser’s URL Bar**\n\nAn emerging trend among all browsers is the combination of searching and navigating from the same box, referred to as URL Bar in this paper. When users are\nattracted by something they see on the web, they can type, or more commonly,\ncopy and paste it into the URL Bar to directly search more information about\nit. Considering that Android Clipboard is globally accessible to all the apps on\nthe same device without requiring any permission, a malicious app can modify\nthe content on the clipboard and inject malicious JavaScript code with some\nsmall tricks to hide the attack from the user’s attention. Figure 2 illustrates the\nphases involved in such an attack.\nThe success of the attack relies on the browser setting of JavaScript execution\nin URL Bar and the trick applied by attackers to hide themselves from the\nvictims. To study the influence of such attacks, we systematically analyzed the\ndefault setting of the built-in Android browser and other top 10 browsers on\nGoogle Play. The testing device is Samsung Galaxy Nexus running Android\n4.3 (JELLY BEAN). We manually installed each browser app and typed the\nfollowing JavaScript into its URL Bar:\n```\n  javascript:alert(’Android Clipboard Attacks’);\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nAttacks on Android Clipboard 5\n\n**Fig. 2. JavaScript Injection on Vulnerable Browser’s URL Bar via Copy-and-Paste**\n\nIf an alert window is displayed, we conclude that the browser allows JavaScript\nexecution in its URL Bar by default. We also studied the maximal characters\nvisible on the URL Bar for each browser. The study results are included in Table 1. Different from desktop browsers that usually disallow pasting JavaScript\ncode to URL Bar, all the studied mobile browsers allow such an operation. However, Firefox and UC Browser do not support JavaScript execution directly from\nthe URL Bar, making themselves immune to such attacks. To hide the attack\nfrom users’ attention, attackers could simply add enough blank spaces before the\nmalicious code. The number of blank spaces depends on the largest number of\nvisible characters in each browser’s URL Bar. The goal is to make the malicious\ncode invisible to victim users unless they scroll down to check all the characters\nin the URL bar.\n\n**Android Browser Apps # of Installs JavaScript Execution Visible Chars**\n\nBuilt-in Browser N/A \u0013 _<26_\nFirefox _>10,000,000_ \u0017 _<33_\nDolphin _>10,000,000_ \u0013 _<20_\nONE _>1,000,000_ \u0013 _<23_\nOpera Mini _>50,000,000_ \u0013 _<40_\nUC Browser _>10,000,000_ \u0017 _<29_\nChrome _>100,000,000_ \u0013 _<33_\nOpera _>10,000,000_ \u0013 _<33_\nDolphin Mini _>1,000,000_ \u0013 _<24_\nMaxthon _>1,000,000_ \u0013 _<25_\nBoat _>1,000,000_ \u0013 _<23_\n\nTable 1: Analysis of the URL Bar in Top Android Browser Applications\n\nTo launch the attack, the malicious app simply implements a service that defines a listener callback inside. The callback is invoked whenever the primary clip\non the clipboard changes, allowing attackers to inject JavaScript code. The at\n|Android Browser Apps|# of Installs|JavaScript Execution|Visible Chars|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Built-in Browser|N/A|\u0013|<26|\n|Firefox|>10,000,000|\u0017|<33|\n|Dolphin|>10,000,000|\u0013|<20|\n|ONE|>1,000,000|\u0013|<23|\n|Opera Mini|>50,000,000|\u0013|<40|\n|UC Browser|>10,000,000|\u0017|<29|\n|Chrome|>100,000,000|\u0013|<33|\n|Opera|>10,000,000|\u0013|<33|\n|Dolphin Mini|>1,000,000|\u0013|<24|\n|Maxthon|>1,000,000|\u0013|<25|\n|Boat|>1,000,000|\u0013|<23|\n\n\n-----\n\n6 Attacks on Android Clipboard\n\ntacking types include but are not restricted to session hijacking, confused deputy,\nintegrity compromise and privacy leakage. However, the damage is limited to\nthe current domain because of the Same Origin Policy (SOP) [19]. To demonstrate each type of attack, we manually installed the latest stable phpBB version\n(3.0.11) [17] on a Dell OPTIPLEX 760 desktop running Ubuntu 12.04. Except\nfor Firefox and UC Browser that do not allow JavaScript execution in their URL\nBar, all the other browsers are vulnerable to the mentioned attacks. In the following sections, all the sample attacks are conducted in Google Chrome on the\ntesting mobile device, unless otherwise specified.\n\n**Session Hijacking. The attacking steps follow exactly the same as in Figure 2,**\nwith the malicious JavaScript sending the victim’s cookies to the remote server.\nAfter that, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the victim’s entire account. It should be noted that the current stable phpBB version (3.0.11) has\nalready implemented several mechanisms to prevent against session hijacking\nattacks, including HttpOnly cookie [9], session IP validation and browser validation. During the demonstration, we manually turned off the three protections.\nHowever, the following Confused Deputy attack does not require the adjustments\non the phpBB3 server, and still being able to achieve the same damage.\n\n**Confused Deputy. Since JavaScript execution in the URL Bar is under the**\nsame context of the current page, the attacker can send malicious requests from\nthere to the remote server and valid cookie will be automatically appended\nby browser. It is impossible for the remote server to distinguish the malicious\nrequests from benign ones, leading to the Confused Deputy attack. All the mentioned protection mechanisms in phpBB3 will be defeated as well since malicious\nrequests are sent from exactly the same browser (defeating browser validation)\non the same mobile device (defeating session IP validation) with all the valid\ncookie value appended (defeating HttpOnly cookie).\n\n**Fig. 3. Integrity Compromise on Google Website**\n\n**Integrity Compromise. In this scenario, the attacker can modify the value**\nof any field on the current page in an unauthorized or undetected manner. Even\nthough the correct value will recover after refreshing the page, data integrity\n\n\n-----\n\nAttacks on Android Clipboard 7\n\nhas already been compromised since accuracy and consistency of data cannot be\nmaintained and assured over its entire life-cycle. Figure 3 shows how attackers\ncan advertise themselves on Google home page within the current interactive\nsession on the victim user’s mobile browser.\n\n**Fig. 4. Privacy Leakage on Facebook Application**\n\n**Privacy Leakage. With the JavaScript injection attack on mobile browsers’**\nURL Bar, attackers are able to steal sensitive information from victims, leading to Privacy Leakage. The most straightforward attack tries to steal the information of the browser itself, including type, version, resolution, history and\nbookmarks. Moreover, leveraging on the HTML5 technology, advanced attackers\ncould also steal victim’s GeoLocation information and everything stored in the\nlocal storage. Figure 4 illustrates the possibility of privacy leakage from Facebook webpage. As it turns out, Facebook even locally stores telephone numbers\nof the victim’s friends.\n\n**4.2** **Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Attack**\n\nDifferent from normal XSS attacks, the clipboard based XSS attack happens\nwhen the victim pastes malicious JavaScript code (manipulated by attackers)\ninto a vulnerable app. As a result of that, the data pasted from the clipboard\nis reflecting the purpose of malicious attackers, while the operations are still\nconducted by the trusted device owner.\nIn our study, we found one vulnerable Android app[1], which has more than\n1,000,000 installs. The app itself is developed using standardized web APIs\nbased on the PhoneGap [16] framework, and thus compatible with various mobile platforms, such as iOS, Android, Windows OS and etc. Unfortunately, its\nuser profile form has XSS vulnerability. When the owner is creating or updating\nhis/her profile, if the content is pasted from the clipboard, malicious apps could\nlaunch XSS attacks targeting at the victim app. The vulnerability detection\ntechniques and potential damages of XSS attacks are well studied in previous\nwork [27,42,44,51,52], so we leave out the details from this paper.\n\n1 To protect the company, we decide not to disclose its name.\n\n\n-----\n\n8 Attacks on Android Clipboard\n\n**4.3** **Cross Origin Invocation Attack**\n\nBoth Android and iOS support the scheme [4,10] mechanism, through which\ncross origin invocation becomes possible, i.e., an app (origin: application) could\nbe invoked by a URL (origin: web) once it registers the URL’s scheme. On\nAndroid, registration happens by simply declaring an intent filter in the app’s\nmanifest file. For example, activity with android:scheme=“fbconnect” inside its\nintent filter could be launched by fbconnect://... typed of links.\nPrevious studies [48] have demonstrated the possibility of unauthorized origin\ncrossing attacks on popular Android apps, such as Facebook and Dropbox. Those\nattacks either need to invoke the browser to load a Dialog URL (Facebook)\nor trick the victim user to click on a malicious link (Dropbox). However, the\nattacking techniques on the clipboard discussed in this paper bring in another\nway to conduct such attacks. Malicious apps could simply replace the clipboard\ncontent with the malicious JavaScript code, which simulates a URL redirecting\nevent to the malicious scheme. Once the code is pasted into browser’s URL bar,\nall the attacks work the same way as in [48].\n\n**4.4** **Dynamic Page Construction**\n\nThe behavior of pure client-side web apps entirely depends on user interactions.\nThe sanitizing technique is less likely to be applied, since the input is provided\nby the “trusted” device owner and will only stay within the app itself. However,\nif the data is copied from the infected clipboard, attackers could potentially\ntrigger the victim apps to perform privileged operation, assuming corresponding\npermissions are granted to the victim app in advance.\nIn our study, we have analyzed PhoneGap-based apps that do not have a\nserver side. The reason is that, as an appealing framework for developers targeting at multiple mobile platforms, PhoneGap is relatively new and few security\nconcerns have been brought into developers’ consideration. The first step of our\nanalysis is to select candidate apps that potentially have the vulnerabilities. For\nthat purpose, we download all the Android apps listed in the PhoneGap homepage and exclude the ones requiring an account on the server side. After that,\nwe search each app for web pages dynamically constructed from user input. The\nwork could be eased with proper static JavaScript analysis tools. However, due\nto the dynamic feature of JavaScript as a programming language, existing static\nanalysis tools [11,12] are only able to serve as syntax checkers and validators.\nConsidering the small number of the candidate apps, we decide to manually analyze them one by one, instead of inventing a complicated tool ourselves. Finally,\nwe paste malicious JavaScript code to vulnerable apps to determine whether\nthey are indeed vulnerable.\nOne vulnerable app, called “Get It Done Task List” [8], is found in our\ndataset, which has roughly 50,000 installs. It is a simple but powerful to-do list\nand project manager, which allows each project to be assigned with a tag, and\nmultiple tags can be managed together as a “Smart Group”. When creating a\n\n\n-----\n\nAttacks on Android Clipboard 9\n\n**Fig. 5. Attack on the Vulnerable Task Manager App**\n\nsmart group, the user first selects desired tags. Then the next web page is dynamically constructed with the all the selected tag names. Due to the lack of\nsanitizing, if the tag name comes from infected clipboard data, attackers could inject malicious JavaScript code and take advantage of all the registered JavaScript\ninterfaces inside the victim app, as shown in Figure 5. Considering the newly\narriving PhoneGap framework and our limited app set, the security situation\nof the entire Android app market may be worse in the future, if appropriate\nattentions are not raised on this issue.\n\n**4.5** **SQL-Type Code Injection**\n\nIn Android, web browsing within apps is eased by the WebView [25] technique,\nwhich packages basic functionalities of browsers, such as page rendering, navigation, and JavaScript execution into a class. Applications requiring these browser\nfunctionalities can simply include the WebView library and create an instance\nof WebView class. By doing so, apps essentially embed a basic browser in them,\nand can thus use it to display web contents and interact with the Web. The interaction is bidirectional: an app can register JavaScript interfaces to its WebView\ncomponent so that in the future, web pages can access the app’s functionalities and resources; an app can also directly load JavaScript into WebView via\n_loadUrl() API. In this section, we only focus on the risks from apps to their We-_\nbView components. However, advanced attackers could use the other interaction\nchannel to communicate back, and thus cause damage on the app side.\nThe JavaScript code loaded to WebView could be pre-defined in apps’ source\ncode. Sometimes, however, the need to dynamically construct JavaScript code\nand load it to WebView is also legitimate. For example, an app may choose to\nuse the following JavaScript to provide search functionality on the loaded web\npages in its WebView component:\n```\n  wv.loadUrl(\"javascript:search(\" + input + \");\");\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n10 Attacks on Android Clipboard\n\nIn the example code, search() is a JavaScript API that takes user input as\nthe search string and return its occurrence. However, the user-provided search\nstring is not filtered for escape characters. If the user pastes the search string\nfrom the clipboard, attackers could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code\ninto the vulnerable app, which results in manipulation of the statement running\non the web pages. This attacking technique is quite similar to the well-studied\nSQL injection attack, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an\nentry field for execution.\n\n**JSGuard Design and Implementation.** There are three key observations\nfrom the vulnerable code above. The first one is regarding the app architecture. It\nmust have a WebView component incorporated and directly execute JavaScript\ncode on loaded web pages. The second observation is the specific pattern of\nthe loaded JavaScript code, which combines pre-defined code, as well as user\ninput obtained during runtime. The last one is the lack of scrutinizing on user\nprovided JavaScript code segment. With all the three observations in mind, we\nhave developed an analysis tool, called JSGuard, to detect this vulnerability\nin Android apps on a large scale. JSGuard is based on Androguard [2], which\nprovides rich functionalities to retrieve various app resources from its APK file.\nJSGuard totally contains 160 Lines Of Code (LOC) written in python, and its\nunderlying logic is depicted in Figure 6.\n\n\nGoogle Play\n\n\nDetermine\n\n\n_loadUrl(‘javascript:) API_\n\n\n**Fig. 6. JSGuard Design**\n\n\n_WebView Component_\n\n\nThe input is the same app set as used in our clipboard usage analysis. In\nthe detection phase, we first check the existence of WebView libraries inside\ncandidate apps. To do that, we open each APK file; disassemble its classes.dex\nfile and search for WebView class from included packages. Similarly, the use of\n_loadUrl() API can also be examined. However, in order to determine whether_\n_loadUrl() is used to load normal web URLs or JavaScript, we have to further_\ndecompile the function in which loadUrl() API is invoked, extract the source\ncode and match “javascript” with the start of loadUrl() argument.\n\n\n_Patterned JavaScript_\n\n\n-----\n\nAttacks on Android Clipboard 11\n\nApplications with JavaScript inside loadUrl() are not necessarily vulnerable\nsince the JavaScript could be pre-defined. The challenge is how to detect dynamic\nconstructed JavaScript in our static analysis. Our solution comes from another\nobservation of the decompiled source code: concatenation of String, which is\nachieved using “+” operator or “concat” API in Java, are both decompiled as\n“.append()”. It should be noted that our detection algorithm so far tries to reduce\nthe false negative as much as we can, but may mislabel secure apps. From the\nsecurity perspective, however, it is more tolerable to have an absolute secure app\nlabeled as vulnerable for future verification, rather than a vulnerable app that\nis considered as secure and put on the market.\n\nOnce apps are identified as containing patterned JavaScript, we manually\nverify the potential vulnerabilities inside by launching the SQL-type JavaScript\ninjection attacks mentioned above. The manual verification experience could\nfurther help to improve our detection algorithm. For example, several apps are\nmislabeled as vulnerable because of the suspicious JavaScript code pattern inside\nthe incorporated Admob advertising libraries. However, the appended string\ncomes from pre-defined advertisement settings and there is no way for attacker\nto inject malicious code.\n\n**Analysis Results and Case Studies. The detection phase takes around 42**\nhours to finish, with an average of 20 seconds spending on each app. The result\nshows that the use of WebView is pervasive. More than 58% of the analyzed\napps also uses loadUrl() API to execute JavaScript code directly inside web\npages. Even if only considering apps with the vulnerable JavaScript pattern,\n1098 (9.4%) need further verification. In our study, we randomly select 100 out\nof the 1098 apps and verify the existence of vulnerabilities manually.\n\n**Fig. 7. SQL-Type Code Injection Attacks**\n\n\n-----\n\n12 Attacks on Android Clipboard\n\nTwo representative vulnerable apps are found. The first one is an e-book\ncalled “Marine Martial Arts MCRP 3-02B” [13], which has roughly 500,000 installs and uses WebView to display the book content. The second one is an\nofficial Samsung app named “Smart TV Now” [20] for its Smart TV product.\nCurrently, the app has more than 500,000 installs on Google Play market. More\nimportantly, it is developed by Samsung developers, which are labeled as “TOP\nDEVELOPERS” on Google Play. Both vulnerabilities are caused of the “Search\nBox” inside the app, which enables user to type in the search text, and then\nconducts the search operation. The implementation of the search feature is identical to the example JavaScript code above. Obviously, if the victim pastes the\nsearch string from the clipboard, the attacker could potentially inject malicious\nJavaScript code or invoke registered JavaScript interfaces inside the app, as\nshown in Figure 7.\n\n## 5 Injection Attacks - Command\n\nThe computing power brought by mobile devices is becoming as competitive as\nnormal desktops, but in the palm of our hands or in our pockets. Now they are\nnot only considered as cell phones, but more of tools to help people finish complicated tasks in their daily life and in work. In Android, terminal apps are widely\navailable on various markets. Based on provided functionalities, they usually fall\ninto three different categories: Remote Terminal can be used to establish a\nconnection with remote servers; Device Terminal enables the access to Android’s built-in Linux command line shell; Combined Terminal incorporates\nboth the functionalities mentioned above. Due to the general lack of physical\nkeyboard on mobile devices and the complexity of command composition, most\nof terminal apps support command copy and paste in common. However, the\nsupport is blind and the source of the pasted command is never validated. It\ncould be either from a legitimate user copy or from the polluted copy already\nmanipulated by attackers.\nIn our study, a total of six popular Android terminal apps are selected and\nevenly distributed to each of the three categorizes, as shown in Table 2. Among\nthem, Android Terminal [5] is the only one that does not support in-app command copy. However, there are various other sources, such as emails and websites,\nwhere victim users can copy commands. The most important observation from\nthe study is that all the selected apps allow user to paste and execute commands\nwithin their terminals. If the pasted commands have been manipulated by malicious apps installed on the same device, depending on the type of the current\nconnection session, various attacks could be launched against the remote server\nor even the Android device itself.\nThe damage caused by vulnerable remote terminal apps on the connected\nserver is self-explained. Basically, attackers could potentially take full control\nof the remote server, steal private data or even delete all the important content.

Otherwise, attacker’s capability\nwill be restricted by the permission set granted to the victim app. Attackers\ncould also hide themselves from user consent by appending a newline symbol\nand the “clear” command. While the newline symbol will force the execution of\nmalicious commands immediately after user’s paste operation, “clear” command\nwill remove the execution history from the current terminal window.\n\n## 6 Injection Attacks - Phishing\n\nPhishing attacks, known as attempts to acquire sensitive information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity [37], have increased exponentially in recent\nyears [18]. Despite common phishing techniques [15], Android Clipboard makes\nit easier for attackers to successfully launch phishing attacks, since mobile users\nperform much more copy-paste operations compared to on desktop environment,\nleaving attacks plenty of opportunities to redirect users to malicious entities.\nBased on different targets, we categorize phishing attacks on Android devices as\nshown in Figure 8.\n\n**Fig. 8. Mobile Phishing Attacks via the Clipboard**\n\n|Application Name|Type|# of Installs|Copy|Paste|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Android Terminal Emulator|Device Terminal|5,000,000 - 10,000,000|\u0013|\u0013|\n|ConnectBot|Remote Terminal|1,000,000 - 5,000,000|\u0013|\u0013|\n|Android Terminal|Device Terminal|100,000 - 500,000|\u0015|\u0013|\n|JuiceSSH - SSH Client|Combined Terminal|100,000 - 500,000|\u0013|\u0013|\n|Terminal IDE|Combined Terminal|100,000 - 500,000|\u0013†|\u0013|\n|Server Auditor - SSH client|Remote Terminal|10,000 - 50,000|\u0013|\u0013|\n\n\n-----\n\n14 Attacks on Android Clipboard\n\n**Social Website Phishing.** Entry-level attackers could simply replace all the\nURLs copied to the clipboard with desired ones, leading to massive advertising.\nThe assumption is that copied URLs are always lengthy and complicated, so\nthat it is extremely difficult for user to notice the URL differences before hitting the “Enter”. However, advanced attackers may selectively replace matched\nURLs copied to the clipboard. In this case, even if URLs are short and easy to\ndistinguish, attackers could leverage on some common tricks, such as misspelled\nURLs, to succeed in phishing attack. In Figure 8, the malicious app replaces legitimate Facebook URLs with http://www.faceb0ok.com/. It appears as though\nthe URL will take you to the official Facebook website; actually this URL points\nto the “faceb0ok” (i.e. phishing) domain which is controlled by the attacker.\n\n**Social Application Phishing.** Phishing attacks on mobile platforms could\nalso be connected with malicious apps using the scheme mechanism mentioned in\nsection 4.3. Firstly, all the URLs could be replaced with Google Market scheme,\ntricking installation of malicious apps from victim users. Moreover, attackers\ncould design a large number of activities in their malicious apps, with each\nactivity representing one targeted social app’s appearance. For example, any\napp on the device could design an activity that looks exactly like the login page\nin the official Facebook app. When a URL belonging Facebook domain is copied\nto the clipboard, that app replaces it with proper scheme that could launch its\nFacebook-like activity. Most likely, victim users would type in their Facebook\naccount information, since they are expecting something happen from Facebook,\neither in browser or from the “Facebook” (phishing) app.\n\n## 7 Data Leakage Attacks\n\nConsidering various types of sensitive information stored on mobile devices: once\nthey are copied to the clipboard, malicious apps could easily steal the user’s\nprivate information. In this section, we conduct case studies on three main type\nof sensitive data on mobile device to demonstrate the severity of the attack. For\neach category, we select the top 30 free apps on Google Play, and study the\npossibility of sensitive data leakage. Our results are summarized in Table 3.\nAs the result shows, three (10%) of the studied third-party Android Contact\napps have the clipboard support, while four (13.3%) of the studied third-party\nAndroid Calendar apps, with at least 2,600,000 installs in total, support event\ncopying. In order to better cooperate with other apps, they all choose to resolve\nthe Contact or event information as pure text first and then put on the clipboard.\nThe situation becomes even worse when it comes to messaging. All the studied\nmessenger apps, including the built-in one on Android, allow message copying\nand pasting. Due to page limit, table 3 leaves out their names. Once the messages\nare copied and placed on the clipboard, malicious apps could access them without\ndeclaring the READ SMS permission.\n\n\n-----\n\nAttacks on Android Clipboard 15\n\n**Contact (3/30)** **Rank** **# of Installs**\nDW Contacts&Phone&Dialer 8 1,000,000 - 5,000,000\nContact Picker 2.3 9 5,000,000 - 10,000,000\nPhone Book ConTacTs 21 100,000 - 500,000\n**Calendar (4/30)** **Rank** **# of Installs**\nBusiness Calendar Free 6 1,000,000 - 5,000,000\nPETATTO CALENDAR 14 1,000,000 - 5,000,000\nDigiCal Calendar&Widgets 20 500,000 - 1,000,000\nGemini Calendar 23 100,000 - 500,000\n**Messenger** **Rank** **# of Installs**\nALL N/A N/A\n\nTable 3: Study on Popular Android Apps that could Leak Sensitive Data\n\n## 8 Discussion\n\nUnlike the desktop environment, Android treats each app as a different user with\ndifferent privilege. However, a similar design for the desktop clipboard is blindly\nmoved to the Android platform without corresponding changes to accommodate\nits different security model. In this section, we discuss several potential solutions\nfrom different perspectives, for protecting the clipboard from being abused.\n\n**From the User Perspective.** In the current Android implementation, when\nthe user copies data into the clipboard, an alert is displayed. However, the alert is\nmissing when an app silently manipulates or steals the data using the clipboard\nAPIs. We argue that a similar warning message, which displays the calling app’s\ninformation, may help users detect malicious apps’ suspicious behaviors. Then\nthe user can either refuse to paste the injected data from the clipboard, or\nsimply uninstall the calling app. This protection, however, is passive, which\nsolely depends on users’ awareness of security and privacy.\n\n**From the Developer Perspective. There is always a battle between app fea-**\ntures and the security consideration. For example, three studied Contacts apps\nadd the integral Contact copy feature to enrich their functionalities, and thus\nattract more users. However, their security is compromised since they accidentally leak private data to malicious apps. It is challenging to ask app developers\nto sacrifice even one feature for security enhancement. In the specific clipboard\ncase, to protect themselves from the injection attacks, we suggest developers to\ndo further validation on fields which could take input from the clipboard paste.\n\n**From the Android System Perspective. SEAndroid [50] and FlaskDroid [30],**\nboth proposed a flexible Mandatory Access Control (MAC) framework for Android. One advantage of MAC is the ability to confine privileged Android system\ndaemons and access to system resources by apps. By extending their policy enforcement, access to the clipboard service could be restricted to certain apps.\n\n|Contact (3/30)|Rank|# of Installs|\n|---|---|---|\n|DW Contacts&Phone&Dialer|8|1,000,000 - 5,000,000|\n|Contact Picker 2.3|9|5,000,000 - 10,000,000|\n|Phone Book ConTacTs|21|100,000 - 500,000|\n|Calendar (4/30)|Rank|# of Installs|\n|Business Calendar Free|6|1,000,000 - 5,000,000|\n|PETATTO CALENDAR|14|1,000,000 - 5,000,000|\n|DigiCal Calendar&Widgets|20|500,000 - 1,000,000|\n|Gemini Calendar|23|100,000 - 500,000|\n|Messenger|Rank|# of Installs|\n|ALL|N/A|N/A|\n\n\n-----\n\n16 Attacks on Android Clipboard\n\n## 9 Related Work\n\n**9.1** **Desktop Clipboard Security**\n\nAttacks caused by the clipboard on desktop environment have been observed\nin past few years, such as self-XSS attack [21] and hijacking attack [6] through\nAdobe Flash-based ads. Several solutions [7,14] have been proposed and implemented to mitigate the problems above. However, it has been demonstrated\nthat attackers are still able to bypass the protection on Chrome [22]. Our work\nis similar to them in exploiting vulnerabilities inside an app via the clipboard.\nHowever, our work differs from them in four aspects:\n\n**Platform. We focus on mobile platforms, more specifically, Android. Compared**\nto desktop environment, mobile devices contain more sensitive data of the user,\nand thus any security compromise will infer a larger damage on victim users.\n\n**Attack Efforts.** To carry out the attacks on Desktop, significant social engineering efforts are involved to trick victim users to conduct desired operations.\nIn contrast, any application installed on the same Android mobile device potentially could launch the attack without requiring any special privilege.\n\n**Attack Surface.** The attacking surface on mobile devices is larger than on\ndesktop. The attacks on the desktop clipboard only target at browser or webbased apps. However, in our work, many other apps, such as terminal apps,\nContacts apps, Calendar apps and etc., have been demonstrated to be vulnerable\nto attacks through Android Clipboard.\n\n**Solutions.** Google and other big companies have taken the lead to fix the clipboard problem on desktop environment. However, equivalent efforts are missing\non mobile platforms. Moreover, existing solutions on desktop environment are\nlimited to specific apps. In our work, we discuss several initial thoughts on fixing\nthe problem on mobile platforms in general.\n\n**9.2** **Android System Security**\n\nAs a relatively new platform, Android is evolving quickly and has attracted\nlots of attentions from various research groups. A number of studies have been\nconducted on Android system with different security focuses:\n\n**System/Application Vulnerabilities.** Several vulnerabilities have been\nidentified on Android system and applications in recent years. Luo et al. [43]\ndemonstrated attacks on the communication channel between the app and its\nembedded WebView component. Recently, Wang et al. [48] identified unauthorized origin crossing attacks on popular Android apps. Our work focuses on the\nrisk imposed by a different system component, i.e., Clipboard, in Android, but at\nthe same time, brings in another way to conduct such attacks. Privilege escalation is another important problem in Android. Previous works [54,29,32,33,34,40]\n\n\n-----\n\nAttacks on Android Clipboard 17\n\npropose a serious of attacks by leveraging on unguarded public interfaces in vulnerable Android applications. However, Clipboard, as a system public interface\nwith no protection, is overlooked by all of them.\n\n**Privacy Protection.** Another line of research on smartphone security is devoted to protecting users’ private information. Zhou et al. [54] analyze a large\nnumber of applications to assess the prevalence of content provider vulnerabilities in Android. At the same time, several systems have been developed to prevent malicious applications from leaking user privacy, including TaintDroid [35],\nAppFence [41], Aurasium [53], etc. Our work differs from them by focusing on\nthe clipboard. Moreover, data leakage attacks mentioned in this paper are based\non normal apps’ legitimate functionalities and do not require any permissions\nfrom malicious apps. However, techniques from existing work can be applied to\ndetect the unauthorized access to Android Clipboard.\nIt should be noted that Fahl et al. [36] also mentioned the credential stealing attack on Android Clipboard, but only focus on password manager apps.\nIn contrast, our work extends credential stealing to general data leakage problem in Android. More importantly, we have proposed three additional attacks\nvia Android Clipboard, including JavaScript injection, command injection and\nphishing. After demonstrating their feasibility, we provide a systematic analysis\non vulnerable apps to assess the prevalence.\n\n**Privilege Restriction.** Several work have been proposed to restrict the app’s\nprivilege. While Apex [45] allows users to selectively grant permissions to applications during the installation, Saint [46] goes further by governing runtime permission use as dictated by application provider policy. At the same time, several\nideas have been proposed to defeat privilege-escalation attacks, including WoodPecker [40], PScount [26], DroidChecker [31], XMandDroid [28], Stowaway [38],\nand the work developed by Felt et al. [39]. Moreover, AdDroid [47], AdSplit [49]\nand AFrame [55] restrict the untrusted third-party component, i.e., advertisement, inside the application. All the attacks discussed in this paper are caused\nby the ability of an application to arbitrarily access the clipboard in Android.\nWe consider it as a privilege escalation problem, and further argue that a specific\nprivilege restriction framework should exist for the clipboard as well.\n\n**Mandatory Access Control.** Recent studies, including SEAndroid [50] and\nFlaskDroid [30], both proposed a flexible Mandatory Access Control (MAC)\nframework for Android. With the MAC support, a more strict and system-wide\npolicy could be enforced to restrict the access to Android Clipboard.\n\n## 10 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we assess the current security situation of Android Clipboard by\nexamine its usage in 16,000 benign apps and 3,987 malicious apps. Based on\nthe risk assessment, we formulate a series of attacks and categorize them into\ntwo groups, i.e., manipulation and stealing. Clipboard data manipulation may\n\n\n-----\n\n18 Attacks on Android Clipboard\n\nlead to code injection attacks and phishing attacks. Data stealing happens when\nsensitive data or reference is copied to the clipboard. The presence of vulnerable\napps as well as a variety of attack types reflects the severity of the risks imposed\nby Android Clipboard. As a result of that, we suggest developers to be cautions\nof dealing with the clipboard data. In our future work, we will pursue the idea\nof designing a privilege restriction framework specific for Android Clipboard.\n\n## 11 Acknowledgement\n\nWe would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.\nThis work was supported in part by NSF Grants 1017771 and 1318814.
