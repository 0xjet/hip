As generally observed, a malware operator provides a Pay-per-Install**\nservice operator with a payload, a requested number of installations, and a target geographical location. The\nservice operators are then responsible for distributing the malware sample based on the customer’s request, and\nfor which they will be paid. Actors selling “installs” play a key role in the distribution of threats, as well as the\nunderground economy.\n\nTo run this service, Pay-per-Install operators use tools to monitor the number of installations, location of infected\nhosts, and other valuable installations-related information. For the most premium services, actors also operate\na modular loader enabling management of additional payloads, customising the attack chain, improving the\nrate of successful compromise by reducing the detection of payloads.\n\nWhile most Pay-per-Install services use their own traffic distribution network, some purchase traffic generation\nservices, such as those offered by traffers teams, to ensure wide and fast distribution of malware samples.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSEKOIA observed that PrivateLoader is one of the most widely used loaders in 2022. It is used by a Pay-PerInstall service to deploy multiple malicious payloads on the infected hosts.\n\nFirst observed in May 2021, PrivateLoader is a modular malware whose main capability is to download and\n**execute one or several payloads. The loader implements anti-analysis techniques, fingerprints the compromised**\nhost and reports statistics to its C2 server.\n\nSEKOIA analysts tracked PrivateLoader’s network infrastructure for several months and recently conducted an\nin-depth analysis of the malware. In parallel, we also monitored activities related to the ruzki PPI malware\nservice.\n\nThe threat actor ruzki (aka les0k, zhigalsz) advertises their PPI service on underground Russian-speaking\nforums and their Telegram channels under the name ruzki or zhigalsz since at least May 2021. Their business\nmodel consists in selling bundles of thousand installations, located on systems all over the world, or\nspecifically in Europe or in the United States.\n\nOur investigations on Dark Web forums allow us to assess with high confidence that PrivateLoader is the\n**proprietary loader of the ruzki PPI malware service.**\n\n## PrivateLoader, a widespread loader in the PPI landscape\n\n[PrivateLoader is a downloader malware family first publicly reported in February 2022 by Intel471. The loader is](https://intel471.com/blog/privateloader-malware)\nused as part of a PPI service, to deliver payloads of multiple malware families operated by several threat actors\nor intrusion sets.\n\nFollowing is an overview of the PrivateLoader malware capabilities, infrastructure and malware involved in its\ncampaigns.\n\n## Technical analysis\n\nPrivateLoader is a modular C++ loader composed of three modules, including the loader to load the Core\nmodule, the Core module contacting the Command and Control (C2) to get the URL to download the next\npayload, and the Service module ensuring persistence.\n\n\n-----\n\nPrivateLoader s main purpose is to provide an environment where the next payload is downloaded and\nexecuted. To be agnostic, the malware does not embed the next stage, the loader downloads the next payload\nbased on its configuration. The downloaded payload is obfuscated by customised operations developed by the\nauthor and detailed later.\n\nPrivateLoader core module offers the following functionalities:\n\nStack string obfuscation;\nHost fingerprint (used for victim statistic on the C2 panel);\nNext stage payload download over HTTPS and execution;\nAnti-analysis techniques.\n\nExecution of some samples highlight the presence of specifics Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)\n\n[[https://tria.ge/220717-gpte2ahcbp, https://tria.ge/220826-kv1m3saahk]:](https://tria.ge/220717-gpte2ahcbp)\n\nImpair defenses (disables Windows Defender Real Time protection);\n\nThe loader has its own Command and Control, used to gather victim statistics and to send next stage URLs via\nmultiple dead drop resolvers.\n\nPrivateLoader’s main use consists in loading one or several third party malware. To do so, the loader contacts\nhardcoded URLs which are obfuscated in the PE, it then requests the URL(s) that returns a dead drop resolver,\nsubsequently used to get another URL hosting the next stage payload.\n\nAfter downloading the next stage, PrivateLoader deobfuscates its content using byte replacement based on the\nfollowing table:\n\nOriginal Byte Replacement byte\n\n0x00 0x80\n\n0x80 0x0a\n\n0x0a 0x01\n\n0x01 0x05\n\n0x05 0xde\n\n0xde 0xfd\n\n0xfd 0xff\n\n0xff 0x55\n\n0x55 0x00\n\nTable 1 : Byte replacement table\nAfter the bytes substitution, the loader xors the payload content with the key `0x9d`. The downloaded\ndeobfuscated file starts with a magic that is removed before executing the valid PE. A script to extract\nobfuscated payload is provided in the annex.\n\n### Communications\n\nThe communication of PrivateLoader is split in three parts:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. The malware deobfuscates one or several embedded URL(s) not controlled by the attacker (tactic of dead\n\ndrop resolver);\n2. It requests the embedded URL, the response is in plaintext and follows this format: `HOST:<C2 IP\n\naddress>`;\n3. The infected host then requests the C2 over HTTP on a unique endpoint `/base/api/statistics.php`, the\n\nresponse contains the final payload URL obfuscated using XOR operation;\n4. Eventually, the malware downloads the next payload again, obfuscated with a different algorithm.\n\nFigure 1. PrivateLoader communication overview\n\nImage 2: PrivateLoader core module network communication overview\n\n[Discover our CTI and XDR products](https://sekoia.io/en/contact/)\n\nWhile the Dead Drop Resolver technique used by PrivateLoader can leverage legitimate websites such as\nPastebin, the malware can also use proprietary servers with URLs like `/servers.txt` and `/proxies.txt`. In the\nlatter Dead Drop Resolver option, C2 IP is drowned in a list of IP addresses, the correct one is obfuscated by\nscrambling.\n\nThe communication with PrivateLoader C2 is obfuscated xoring the HTTP body with the key `0x6d`, a technique\nconsistently observed across all campaigns.\n\nSEKOIA observed that PrivateLoader operators changed their final payload hosting provider over the summer,\nshifting from Discord attachments to vk.com documents to host the downloaded payload. It is possible that\nPrivateLoader customers are able to provide their own server to host the payload. As increasingly used by\nseveral malware as C2 or as a files hoster, Discord is now under more scrutiny. It is possible this increased\nmonitoring was a driver for PrivateLoader’s recent hosting shift.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Domains hosting final payload downloaded by PrivateLoader observed in between 15 August and 3\nSeptember 2022\n\nAfter downloading the next stage, if the core module is not configured to set up the service module,\ncommunication with the PrivateLoader Core module is cancelled. Core module allows two configurations, the\nfirst one will contact the C2 to load the Service module, the second configuration downloads other malwares and\nends its activity, all remaining communication in this specific configuration belongs to the next stage. SEKOIA\nobserved the second behaviour as the most widespread among campaigns involving PrivateLoader malware.\n\n### PrivateLoader infrastructure\n\nThe infrastructure hosts the C2 servers used by PrivateLoader operators to manage their service. PrivateLoader\nsamples communicate with these C2 servers to retrieve and exfiltrate data, as previously detailed in the\nanalysis.\n\nAt the time of writing, SEKOIA observed 4 currently active C2 servers:\n\n**IP address** **ASN** **Country** **Active since**\n\n79.174.12.174 RU-JSCIOT (29182) Russia 2021-06-30\n\n91.240.85.160 RU-JSCIOT (29182) Russia 2021-08-31\n\n212.193.30.115 AS_DELIS (211252) Czechia 2022-07-26\n\n167.235.29.244 HETZNER-AS (24940) Germany 2022-09-04\n\nTable 2. Active C2 servers on 6 September, 2022\nRequests on publicly exposed endpoints (see the Part “Statistic URLs of PrivateLoader in publications of ruzki\nservice”) suggest that all IP addresses redirect to the same C2. This information is valuable in associating the\nexclusive use of PrivateLoader to a specific PPI service.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo proactively track the PrivateLoader servers, we identified a heuristic based on the characteristic HTTP\nresponse and the HTTP headers on port 80. The servers respond in 200 with a HTML page entitled “404 not\n_found” containing “(Ubuntu) Server at“, with PHP server headers._\n\nSEKOIA also track PrivateLoader servers by searching for the specific PrivateLoader URLs\n(/base/api/getData.php and /base/api/statistics.php) and their administration panel.\n\nMonitoring the PrivateLoader infrastructure, we observed over 30 unique C2 servers. The volume of malicious\ntraffic generated by these servers suggests that the servers are fastly detected by security vendors. Moreover, it\nis highly likely that the servers are eventually shut down if they are not provided by a bulletproof host.\n\n## Malware distributed by PrivateLoader\n\n**In last weeks’ campaigns SEKOIA observed, the following malware families were actively distributed by**\nPrivateLoader payloads:\n\nInformation stealers: Redline, Vidar, [Raccoon,](https://blog.sekoia.io/raccoon-stealer-v2-part-2-in-depth-analysis/) [Eternity, Socelars, Fabookie, YTStealer, AgentTesla,](https://blog.sekoia.io/eternityteam-a-new-prominent-threat-group-on-underground-forums/)\n[Phoenix and other uncategorized stealers.](https://blog.sekoia.io/mars-a-red-hot-information-stealer/)\nRansomware: Djvu.\nBotnet: Danabot, SmokeLoader.\nMiners: XMrig and other uncategorized stealers.\nOther commodity malware: DcRAT, Glupteba, Netsupport, and Nymaim variant.\n\n[PrivateLoader distribution of malware families is documented in Intel471 and](https://intel471.com/blog/privateloader-malware) [Bitsight reports, respectively over](https://www.bitsight.com/blog/tracking-privateloader-malware-distribution-service)\nthe course of September-January 2021, and July-August 2022.\n\nBased on the wide selection of malware families, which implies a wide range of threat actors or intrusion\n**sets operating this malware, the PPI service running PrivateLoader is very attractive and popular to**\n**attackers on underground markets.**\n\n## Ruzki, a popular Pay-Per-Install service\n\nSEKOIA observed that PrivateLoader is one of the most widespread loaders in 2022. To better understand\nthe spread of PrivateLoader, we must consider the PPI service associated with the loader.\n\nSEKOIA investigations on Dark Web forums led us to take a closer look at the ruzki PPI malware service.\nOur observations from ruzki customer publications, botnets delivered by PrivateLoader and ruzki messages\nallowed us to find evidence to link this PPI service and the loader.\n\nAfter a brief description of the ruzki service, we present how we have associated this PPI service to the\n**PrivateLoader malware.**\n\n## What is the ruzki Pay-per-Install service?\n\nThe ruzki PPI service consists of selling bundles of a thousand installations located on systems all over the\nworld, or especially in Europe or in the United States.\n\nSince May 2021, the ruzki (aka les0k, zhigalsz) profile advertised the PPI service under the same name on the\nLolz Guru cybercrime forum. Their publications include pricing information, number of installs per day the service\ncan afford for one customer, and the traffic source. Similar publications are frequently posted by the same profile\non the Telegram channel (t[.]me/ZHIGALSZinstalls) associated with the services.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Les0k’s publication related to ruski’s PPI service pricing on 1 September, 2022 (source: Lolz Guru)\n\nOn 1 September, 2022, buying 1,000 installations on infected systems:\n\nWorldwide (also called Mix world installs) costs $70;\nLocated in Europe costs $300;\nLocated in the United States costs $1,000.\n\nAll prices are degressive based on the quantity.\n\n_Ruzki threat actor recommends customers to buy unique installs packages for higher output. Indeed, a single_\nclassic installation can be sold to several customers, making the output of the compromise low for them. While\n_unique installs are sold to a single customer. The exploitation of these installations is therefore more profitable_\nsince the customer has exclusive access.\n\nAt its launch, the service could offer up to 20,000 installations per day. As of today, we have not found numbers\non the current capabilities of the PPI service. The traffic generation relies on an affiliate network that\nrepresented, in May 2021, 800 webmasters leveraging multiple infection chains. SEKOIA suspects that one or\nmore traffers teams are behind these webmasters.\n\nSEKOIA analysts were able to establish ruzki’s PPI modus operandi based on customers’ feedback, notably\nshared through screenshots of their conversations with the ruzki PPI service operator. On another note, most of\nthe feedback was written following the ruzki operator on their Telegram channel.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Ruzki service operator post requesting feedback in their Telegram channel 30 mai\n\n_(traduction du message)_\n\nBelow is an outline of the service, as observed by SEKOIA:\n\n**Step 1: The malware operator willing to distribute its payload contacts the ruzki service’s operator on Telegram**\n(t[.]me/zhigalsz), providing its requested number of installs and the target geographical location.\n\n**Step 2: The PPI service’s operator sets the price of the request, and provides the malware operator with a**\ncryptocurrency wallet address.\n\n**Step 3: The malware operator provides a proof of the transfer (oftentimes a screenshot of a cryptocurrency**\napplication) to conclude the financial transaction, and supplies the payload it wants to distribute.\n\n**Step 4: The ruski service’s operator shares a password-protected link to follow statistics on the number of**\ninstalls related to the customer’s payload.\n\n**Step 5: Webmasters are responsible for distributing the customer payload.**\n\nFurther analysis of the ruzki PPI service allowed SEKOIA to establish a link with PrivateLoader.\n\n## PrivateLoader’s association with the ruzki Pay-per-Install service\n\nSeveral observations allow us to associate with a high level of confidence the PrivateLoader as the main tool of\nthe ruzki PPI service.\n\n### Statistic URLs of PrivateLoader in publications of ruzki service\n\nIn recent months, malware operators who subscribed to the ruzki service shared screenshots of conversation\nwith ruzki. These conversations contain a URL provided by the PPI service operator to its customers to monitor\nstatistics related to their campaign of installations.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Capture of the conversation between a customer of the ruzki PPI service and ruzki (source: Lolz Guru)\n\n\n-----\n\nThese URLs match those of the PrivateLoader C2 servers and the endpoint /links/stats matches that of a\nPrivateLoader C2 server.\n\n\n**IP addresses mentioned by ruzki**\n**customers**\n\n\n**PrivateLoader C2 in SEKOIA.IO CTI**\n\n\n45.144.225[.]243 on May 30, 2022 Active since 2021, until August 26, 2022\n\n212.193.30[.]115 on August 24, 2022 Active since July 17, 2022, and still active at moment of\nwriting\n\nTable 3. IP addresses mentioned by ruzki PPI customers and retrieved via SEKOIA C2 Trackers\n\n[Discover our CTI and XDR products](https://sekoia.io/en/contact/)\n\n### Redline campaigns associated to Ruzki botnets\n\nWhile tracking PrivateLoader, we retrieved multiple PrivateLoader samples downloading the Redline information\nstealer as a final payload. We were able to associate a majority of retrieved Redline’s samples to PrivateLoaderloaded botnets, including ruzki9, nam6.2, cryptex, @forceddd_lzt, ruzki, don_karl_installs, 3108_RUZKI,\n_persom, 2007329039 and riii_ff._\n\nWhile evidence is very thin at this stage to formally associate these Redline botnets to ruzki, several botnets’\nnames suggest some sort of connection to the threat actor. One hypothesis is that ruzki’s customers could name\ntheir botnet based on the PPI service they use to distribute their samples. Another hypothesis is that ruzki\noperates the Redline malware in parallel to the PPI service activity.\n\nRegardless of the operators behind the Redline samples, it is yet another indication of a likely connection\nbetween PrivateLoader and ruzki.\n\n### A perfect timing\n\nThe ruzki operator was active on Telegram and Russian-speaking underground forums since at least May 2021:\n\nThe profile les0k advertising the ruzki PPI service joined Lolz Guru on May 1, 2021;\nzhigalsz, the first Telegram channel associated with the service was created on May 7, 2021.\n\nAdditionally, Intel471 assesses that PrivateLoader is used since at least May 2021. Building upon previously\noutlined observations, this increases our confidence in associating PrivateLoader with the ruzki PPI service.\n\nIn addition to the URLs shared to ruzki customers and Redline botnets named using “ruzki”, we observed that\nthe ruzki operator uses the term “our loader” in Russian on its Telegram channel.\n\n_Ruzki’s publication in Telegram channel associated with the service, on 16 February, 2022:_\n\n_У нас своя сеть вебмастеров и мы являемсяклиенты, хочу вам соотрафика. Также наш лоадер каждый_\n_день чистится и отстук около 80%. (Translated from Russian: We have our own network of webmasters and_\n_we are clients, I want you to cooperate. Also, our loader is cleaned every day and the turnover is around 80%.)_\n\nMoreover, we identified a single botnet associated with all the PrivateLoader C2 servers. SEKOIA therefore\nassess with high confidence that PrivateLoader is the proprietary loader of the ruzki PPI malware service.\n\nThe spread of PrivateLoader could therefore be explained by the following elements:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe popularity of the associated service among threat actors (competitive pricing, good service and\nsupport, accessibility to less experienced threat actors and intrusion sets);\nA distribution of PrivateLoader oriented on the quantity of installations, rather than on the quality;\nA good coverage of this threat within SEKOIA, and more generally within the cybersecurity community.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPay-per-Install services always played a key role in the distribution of commodity malware, and more\ngenerally in the increase of the threat surface exposure. While the cybercrime ecosystem related to PPI\nservices is constantly evolving with new threat actors and emerging malware, the ruzki Pay-per-Install service\n**using PrivateLoader is established for over a year.**\n\nPrivateLoader became one of the most widespread loaders used for a PPI service in 2022. This downloader\nmalware is used to deliver multiple malware including information stealers, ransomware, botnets and miners.\nTracking PrivateLoader provides an interesting insight into prevalent commodity malware in the\n**cybercriminal landscape, as well as uncovering unidentified and emerging malware. As yet another turnkey**\nsolution lowering the cost of entry into the cybercriminal market and a service contributing to a continuous\n**professionalisation of the cybercriminal ecosystem, it is highly likely more PrivacyLoader-related activity will be**\nobserved in the short term.\n\n[To provide our customers with actionable intelligence, SEKOIA analysts will continue to track PrivateLoader C2](https://www.sekoia.io/en/about/)\ninfrastructure, analyse malware technical evolution and monitor the ruzki Pay-per-Install service and their\ncustomers.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK TTPs\n\n**Tactic**
