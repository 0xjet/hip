In_\n_December 2020, Microsoft began sharing details with the world about what became known_\n_as the most sophisticated nation-state cyberattack in history. Microsoft’s_ _four-part video_\n_series “Decoding NOBELIUM” pulls the curtain back on the NOBELUM incident and how_\n_world-class threat hunters from Microsoft and around the industry came together to take on_\n_the most sophisticated nation-state attack in history. In this second post, we’ll explore the_\n_[investigation in the second episode of the docuseries.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RWLJ5f)_\n\nThe threat hunters had but weeks to unravel a global attack that had been planned and\nexecuted by an advanced adversary for over a year. The early days of a cyberattack\ninvestigation can feel like joining a high-stakes chess match after your opponent has already\nmade a series of moves. You must figure out what your adversary has done while\nanticipating their next step, and launching a counterplay—all simultaneously. Instead of on a\nchessboard, your clues are found in the code, logs, and responses to your counterattacks. In\nthe case of the NOBELIUM nation-state attack, this was a highly skilled chess player, but we\ncame together as a company and as an industry to take on this shared adversary. This all\nstarted when one security company, Mandiant (formerly known as FireEye), spotted an\nanomaly in its own environment and shared the evidence with Microsoft for additional\nanalysis, but this story would eventually involve thousands of defenders across the industry\nto uncover the full picture and help protect organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs explained in our first post in this series, How nation-state attackers like NOBELIUM are\nchanging cybersecurity, nation-state attacks are malicious cyberattacks that originate from a\nparticular country and are an attempt to further that country’s interests. The nation-state\nattack from NOBELIUM, a Russia-sponsored group of hackers, is widely recognized as the\nmost sophisticated in history. The group gained access to multiple enterprises before their\n[actions were detected. This second episode of “Decoding NOBELIUM” explores how the](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RWLJ5f)\ngroup was detected and how defenders responded in the weeks that followed.\n\n## How was NOBELIUM detected?\n\nIt was late November 2020 when a security analyst at cybersecurity company Mandiant\ndetected something unusual in its environment. While reviewing sign-in logs for the previous\nday, she noticed an event for a user with a different registered device. Intuition told her\nsomething was off so she called the user to ask if they’d registered a new device. The\nanswer would set off an unprecedented, industry-wide hunt to catch a cybercriminal. The\nuser said, “No.”\n\nThe security professional alerted her colleagues, including her supervisor, Charles Carmakal,\nMandiant Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. While they didn’t yet know the\nidentity of the adversary, they would come to realize the importance of this initial detection.\n\nRecognizing that his company needed more collaboration and telemetry to better understand\nthe nature of the attack, Carmakal quickly turned to Microsoft. It was about 9:00 PM when\nMicrosoft Detection and Response Team (DART) Lead Dan Taylor received the call asking\nfor help. Dan initially thought Carmakal was joking and when he realized it was serious, he\ncalled Microsoft DART Lead Investigator Roberto, who was taking his dog for the last walk of\nthe day, to ask him if he recognized the anomalous code Mandiant had found. Roberto\nconfirmed that he had seen this anomaly during a previous nation-state investigation.\n\n## How did the defense team come together?\n\nEvery second counts when responding to large-scale cyberattacks like this. NOBELIUM had\na year-long advantage on the defenders. A global threat-hunting effort was formed around\nthe [Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center, which defends Microsoft and its customers from](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/insidetrack/microsoft-uses-threat-intelligence-to-protect-detect-and-respond-to-threats)\nadvanced threat actors around the world. They immediately activated Microsoft’s team of\nglobal security experts, who are on-call for major incidents.\n\nMicrosoft Security Analyst Joanne was lacing up her hiking boots on a Saturday when she\nreceived a text from her supervisor to the entire team that read, “We need all hands on deck\nfor an active incident.” The hike would have to wait as she and her teammates began\nstudying the available data for indicators of an attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs Microsoft continued to partner with Mandiant, it quickly became clear that this attack\nextended well beyond one security company. The Microsoft response team grew along with\nthis knowledge. With every meeting, another 50 to 100 Microsoft threat experts joined in—\neveryone came together to help. And the industry-wide collaboration grew as well. “Many\ndifferent partners across the industry came together with a common goal,” said Ramin,\nSenior Malware Reverse Engineer with the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center.\n\nThe biggest challenge was the sophisticated tradecraft of the attacker. They practiced\nextreme variability. “It became very clear to us that we were dealing with a highly capable,\nhighly clandestine, and advanced adversary,” said Carmakal. NOBELIUM would never use\nthe same IP address across organizations—even going so far as to change it every time the\ngroup re-entered the same organization’s network. That meant that traditional markers—\nincluding hashes, file names, and IP addresses—were all brittle indicators and less helpful\nfor tracking the attacker’s path. Over time, they began identifying subtle markers of malicious\nactivity.\n\nThe team’s relentless investigation led to a breakthrough—they discovered that the unknown\nthreat actor was stealing credentials and moving through the networks undetected. During\nthe ongoing investigation, the team uncovered that anomalous activity was happening within\nthe SolarWinds platform. After decompiling 50,0000 lines of SolarWind’s code, Mandiant and\nMicrosoft’s reverse engineers identified NOBELIUM malware carefully obfuscated within\nlayers of code, designed to easily spread undetected to thousands of target organizations.\n“When we found that scope, it was a combination of exciting and scary,” said Pete, Senior\nSoftware Engineer of the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center.\n\n“You got a sense that this attacker could start in hundreds of customer networks, very deep\ninto them with elevated rights,” said John Lambert, General Manager of the Microsoft Threat\nIntelligence Center. “When you realize how many enterprise customers and government\ndepartments use [SolarWinds], you knew that this attacker had achieved a place to have\nmajor impact, across the globe.”\n\nOver weeks, the hunters uncovered a sophisticated, advanced threat with a scale and scope\nbeyond anything they could have initially guessed. Now, it was time to use that hard-won\nknowledge to find and repel the current threat from NOBELIUM and prepare for future\nattacks.\n\n## NOBELIUM lessons\n\nHow did cybersecurity professionals identify NOBELIUM as the threat actor behind the attack\nand what can your organization do to detect and respond to nation-state attacks? In the\n[second episode of our four-part video series “Decoding Nobelium,” security professionals](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/nation-state-attacks#office-ContentAreaHeadingTemplate-hkzu7ix)\ntalk about the investigation that followed the discovery of NOBELIUM’s attack. Watch the\nepisode for tips on how to protect your organization against cyberattacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft is committed to helping organizations stay protected from cyberattacks, whether\ncybercriminal or nation-state. In particular, nation-state adversaries have significant expertise\nand resources and will develop new attack patterns to further their geopolitical objectives.\nConsistent with our mission to provide security for all, Microsoft will use our leading threat\nintelligence and global team of dedicated cybersecurity defenders to help protect our\ncustomers and the world. Just two recent examples of Microsoft’s efforts to combat nationstate attacks include a September 2021 discovery, an investigation of a NOBELIUM malware\nreferred to as FoggyWeb, and our May 2021 profiling of NOBELIUM’s early-stage toolset\n[compromising EnvyScout, BoomBox, NativeZone, and VaporRage.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/28/breaking-down-nobeliums-latest-early-stage-toolset/)\n\n[For immediate support, reach out to the Microsoft Security Response Center.
