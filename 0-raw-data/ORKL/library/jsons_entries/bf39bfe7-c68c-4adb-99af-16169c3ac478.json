The actor\ndeposited 4 BTC (approximately $150,000 USD) into their escrow account. Large deposits\non the forum indicate the seriousness of the threat actor.\n\n## BlackMatter Registration\n\nOn July 19, 2021, a threat actor operating under the alias “BlackMatter” registered an\naccount on the high-tier Russian-language illicit forums XSS and Exploit. The actor\ndeposited 4 BTC (approximately $150,000 USD) into their escrow account. Large deposits\non the forum indicate the seriousness of the threat actor. On July 21, the threat actor posted\na notice on the forums, stating they are looking to purchase access to infected corporate\nnetworks in the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK, presumably for ransomware operations.\nThe threat actor said they are looking for larger corporate networks with revenues of over US\n$100 million.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the inclusion of Five Eyes countries is notable, it is likely more financially-motivated\nthan strategic. US, Canada, Australia, and the UK are ranked among the top 10 mosttargeted countries for publicly-reported incidents on ransomware blogs and, further, the April\n2021 paper from the Institute for Security and Technology Ransomware Task Force\nhighlighted that White House and DNI would coordinate with Five Eyes on a number of\naction items for combating ransomware.  Recent reports highlight intelligence sharing with1\npartner countries on suspicious cryptocurrency transactions in foreign exchanges.2\n\n## Re-emergence? \n\n\nThe timing of the post is interesting in that it occurred two months after XSS, Exploit, and\nRaid Forums [banished the DarkSide ransomware group, and forbade the discussion and](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/darkside-faces-xss-ban-servers-seized/)\nsolicitation of ransomware with the forums. DarkSide ransomware group was responsible for\nextorting Colonial Pipeline, resulting in a disruption in one of the largest oil pipelines in the\nUnited States. Shortly after the incident, DarkSide’s blog was offline and the Justice\nDepartment claimed that they recovered $2.3 million from Colonial’s ransomware payment.3\n“UNKN” (aka “Unknown”) a representative of REvil, relayed DarkSide’s shutdown through a\nforum post.\n\n1https://securityandtechnology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IST-Ransomware-Task\n_Force-Report.pdf_\n\n\n_2_ _[https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/06/politics/white-house-ransomware-strategy/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/06/politics/white-house-ransomware-strategy/index.html%20)_\n\n_3https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-_\n\n_ransomware-extortionists-darkside_\n\n[On July 13, 2021, REvil abruptly shut down their ransomware blog. On the same day, XSS](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/revil-is-down-not-out/)\nbanned REvil’s spokesperson UNKN. The shutdown followed REvil’s high-profile\n[ransomware attack against the technology provider, Kaseya.](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/kaseya-ransomware-attack-revil-dismisses-mounting-global-scrutiny-with-more-large-scale-targets/)\n\nBlackMatter does not openly state that they are a ransomware collective operator, which\ntechnically doesn’t break the rules of the forums, though the language of their post, as well\nas their goals clearly indicate that they are a ransomware collective operator.\n\n## Re-branding?\n\nThe emergence of a new group following the closure of DarkSide and REvil leaves threat\nactors questioning their origins, and if this is a possible rebranding. Both BlackMatter and\nUNKN appear to have similar rules around targeting. For example, both BlackMatter and\nUNKN explicitly say they will not target medical and government institutions. Regarding\ntactics, both groups use the same public corporate databases to research possible victims.\nFurthermore, Flashpoint analysts note that REvil previously labeled their Windows Registry\nkey “BlackLivesMatter.”\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the information may not be a smoking gun, it may indicate that REvil has not gone\ntotally offline, but merely took a small hiatus following some high-profile breaches. It is also\nimportant to note that two posts and a large escrow account do not make a ransomware\ngroup. It is possible that copycats are intentionally mimicking the behavior of REvil to gain\nimmediate credibility for allegedly being the reincarnation of REvil.\n\n## Ran Somewhere? No, Still Here\n\nWhile recent bans on forums made it significantly harder for ransomware collectives to\nrecruit partners, nevertheless ransomware collectives are finding new creative avenues to\nattract threat actors, who would be interested in working with them.\n\nFor instance, on July 22, 2021, Flashpoint observed an advertisement of the partner program\nof the AvosLocker Ransomware collective. The advertisement was distributed on Jabber via\na service called “HQ Advert Services,” which specializes in mass spam campaigns via\nJabber and Telegram. HQ Advert and other similar services maintain a list of Jabber and\nTelegram handles and are able to distribute the advertisements of interest for a fee.\n\nPrior to that, ransomware actors have also maintained communications on a number of other\nplatforms. Some, such as Black Shadow, maintain Telegram accounts, others, such as\nLockBit 2.0, run ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) recruitment on their forums, and still\nothers have moved to new forums for RaaS recruitment such as Babuk’s RAMP forum.\n\nAt this time, we can only assess the possible origins and intentions of BlackMatter. Their\npresence on XSS and Exploit highlights the increasing importance of those forums in\nransomware recruitment, despite the apparent bans in May 2021.\n\n## Re-recruitment\n\nOn July 27, the group began recruiting potential partners and affiliates via IM protocol,\nJabber. Notably, the group is using Exploit’s Jabber server to send out their recruitment\nmessage, again showing ransomware groups utilizing Exploit’s infrastructure to forward their\nnefarious agenda despite an alleged ban.\n\nIn the advertisement, BlackMatter announced they were looking for experienced penetration\ntesters who work with Windows and Linux systems and initial access suppliers, who would\neither sell their access or work for a percentage of the profits. The group listed their Jabber\nhandle and Tox ID, and asked interested parties to contact them.\n\n## Remodel? Who Wore it Best?\n\nFlashpoint analysts also discovered a leaks site on an onion domain run by the group, in\nwhich BlackMatter expands its rules on targeting to include restrictions on targeting the oil\nand gas sector and the defense and CI sector. The leaks site currently does not list any\n\n\n-----\n\nvictims.\n\nAfter the discovery of the site, rumors again abounded claiming that BlackMatter is a\nrebranding of the group DarkSide, which went offline after losing control of their infrastructure\nin May 2021. These rumors are based on the design of the BlackMatter leaks site, which is\nsimilar to the now-defunct DarkSide leaks site, and by the fact that BlackMatter explicitly\nstated they would not target the oil and gas industry — a nod to the Colonial Pipeline breach\nwhich proved DarkSide’s demise. At this time, there is no concrete evidence connecting the\ntwo and\n\nWhen DarkSide went offline and their alias “darksupp” was banned from the Russianlanguage illicit forum XSS, the administrators seized the group’s sizable deposit of 23 BTC\n(approximately US $911,000) and distributed it among former DarkSide partners. This is\nnotable because such a move might have discouraged any former members of DarkSide to\nmake substantial deposits on illicit forums, as BlackMatter did when making a BTC 4 deposit\non Exploit.\n\n\n-----\n\nblackmatter-ransomware\n\n\nImage 1: Screenshot of the BlackMatter leaks site, which bares a resemblance to DarkSide’s\nnow-defunct leaks site.\n\n## Track Ransomware Activity With Flashpoint\n\nThe data above was discovered directly through analyst research in the Flashpoint platform.\n[Sign up for a free trial, and see firsthand how Flashpoint can help you and your organization](https://go.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/request-a-demo/)\naccess the most critical information affecting your industry and the security community.\n\n\n-----",
