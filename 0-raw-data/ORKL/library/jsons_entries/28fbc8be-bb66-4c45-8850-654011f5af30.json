The wiper, which destroys user data and partition\ninformation from attached drives, was spotted on several dozen systems in a limited\nnumber of organizations. It is detected by ESET products as Win32/KillDisk.NCX.\n\n_RELATED READING:_ _[Industroyer2: Industroyer reloaded](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/04/12/industroyer2-industroyer-reloaded/)_\n[CaddyWiper bears no major code similarities to either HermeticWiper or](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/02/24/hermeticwiper-new-data-wiping-malware-hits-ukraine/) [IsaacWiper, the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/)\nother two new data wipers that have struck organizations in Ukraine since February 23 .rd\n\nMuch like with HermeticWiper, however, there’s evidence to suggest that the bad actors\nbehind CaddyWiper infiltrated the target’s network before unleashing the wiper.\n\n[#BREAKING](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#ESETresearch warns about the discovery of a 3rd destructive wiper](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ESETresearch?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[deployed in Ukraine %.

The campaigns also\nleveraged HermeticWizard, a custom worm used for propagating HermeticWiper inside\nlocal networks, and HermeticRansom, which acted as decoy ransomware.\n\nThe next day, a second destructive attack against a Ukrainian governmental network\nstarted, this time deploying IsaacWiper.\n\n## Ukraine in the crosshairs\n\nIn January of this year, another data wiper, called [WhisperGate, swept through the networks](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/)\nof multiple organizations in Ukraine.\n\nAll these campaigns are only the latest in a long string of attacks to have hit high-profile\ntargets in the country over the past eight years.
