They go on to say they have personally earned $150\nmillion, which they have cashed out and invested in legal business entities.\n\n**GandCrab Ransomware**\nWith this announcement GandCrab has said they have stopped promoting the ransomware,\nasked the affiliates to stop distributing the ransomware within 20 days, and asked their topic\nto be deleted at the end of the month.\n\n**Moderator closing the topic**\nThey have also told victims to pay for needed decryption now as their keys will be deleted\nat the end of the month. This is could be a last money grab and we hope that the GandCrab\ndevs will follow other large ransomware operations and release the keys when shutting\n\n\n-----\n\ndown.\n\nBleepingComputer has reached out to the developers and asked them to do so.\n\nHistorically, BleepingComputer has seen large-scale ransomware operations fill the void left\nwhen another ransomware shuts down. It would not be surprising to see another operation\nspring up in the near future, especially when as noted by GandCrab:\n\n\"We have proven that by doing evil deeds, retribution does not come.\"\n\n## Lofty claims of earnings\n\nWhile the operators behind GandCrab most likely made many millions of dollars, the claims\nof $2 billion in ransom payments are very likely to be untrue.\n\nThese lofty claims are not surprising, as the developers of GrandCrab have always been\njokesters and have engaged security researchers in ways most malware developers do\nnot.\n\nUsing taunts, jokes, and references to organizations and researchers in their code, it was\nobvious that the GandCrab developers were monitoring us as much as we were monitoring\nthem and got a big kick out of it.\n\nFor example, in their first release of the ransomware, GandCrab decided to use domain\nnames for their Command & Control servers that are based on organizations and sites\nknown for ransomware research. For example, you can bleepingcomputer, nomoreransom,\neset, and emsisoft listed below in their initial C2 servers.\n```\nbleepingcomputer.bit\nnomoreransom.bit\nesetnod32.bit\nemsisoft.bit\ngandcrab.bit\n\n```\nThey also frequently dropped hellos to researchers who analyzed their ransomware.\n\nHello, [#GandCrab :)](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GandCrab?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/ICHixxoIkI](https://t.co/ICHixxoIkI)\n\n[— Marcelo Rivero (@MarceloRivero) April 17, 2018](https://twitter.com/MarceloRivero/status/986045072272691201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nIt was not all fun and games, though, for the GandCrab operators also had a vindictive\nstreak. After AhnLab released a vaccine app for GandCrab, the ransomware developers\ncontacted BleepingComputer to tell us that they were releasing a zero-day for the AhnLab\nv3 Lite antivirus.\n\n\n-----\n\nCaption\nTheir antics and success didn't go unnoticed by other members of Exploit.in who wished\nthem farewell or were saddened to see them leave.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the GandCrab antics have been amusing at times, they ultimately inflicted a lot of\npain and suffering on many people who lost their data, work, and potentially even\nbusinesses. Their shutdown of operations is a good thing.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[GandCrab](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/gandcrab/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
