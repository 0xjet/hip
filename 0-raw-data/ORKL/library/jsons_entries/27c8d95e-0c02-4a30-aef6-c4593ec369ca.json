The impetus of this research is twofold: to_\n_provide indicators to leverage for protection for likely victims and to raise awareness of a_\n_possible shift in adversary TTPs._\n\n### Executive Summary\n\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group has identified two new cyberespionage campaigns targeting\nthe Tibetan Community over the past two years. The campaigns, which we are collectively\nnaming RedAlpha, combine light reconnaissance, selective targeting, and diverse malicious\ntooling. We discovered this activity as the result of pivoting off of a new malware sample\nobserved targeting the Tibetan community based in India.\n\nInsikt Group’s analysis of infrastructure overlap among the new campaigns reveals wider\ntargeting of the Chinese “Five Poisons, ” in addition to South and Southeast Asian 1\n\ngovernments. Based on the campaign’s targeting of “Five Poisons”-related organizations,\noverlapping infrastructure, and links to malware used by other Chinese APTs uncovered\nduring our research, we assess with medium confidence that the RedAlpha campaigns\nwere conducted by a Chinese APT.\n\n### Key Judgments\n\n  - The two newly discovered RedAlpha campaigns targeting the Tibetan community\ntook place in 2017 and 2018. For ease of reference, we’ll call them the “2017\nhktechy” and “2018 internetdocss” campaigns, after their command-and-control (C2)\nservers.\n\n  - Attacker tradecraft evolved from bespoke malware consisting of a custom dropper\nand the NetHelp infostealer implant in 2017 to a custom validator and njRAT\ncommodity malware in 2018. The 2018 internetdocss campaign also leveraged\nscaled-down infrastructure to possibly reduce the impact of discovery and avoid the\nloss of proprietary tools and costly to maintain infrastructure.\n\n  - Both campaigns involved the use of payloads configured with several C2 servers;\nhowever, malware from both campaigns made use of the doc.internetdocss[.]com\nC2 domain, thus tying both campaigns together.\n\n1 The “Five Poisons” are threats the Chinese Communist Party sees to its stability including Uyghurs, Tibetans, Falun Gong,\nChinese democracy movement, and Taiwan's independence movement.\n\n\n-----\n\n  - A malicious Microsoft Word document that exploited CVE-2017-0199 was also used\nduring the RedAlpha campaigns. This sample was first seen in the wild during the\n57-day CNNVD vulnerability publication lag highlighted by previous Recorded Future\nresearch, further supporting the theory that the delay in publication by CNNVD was\nto enable Chinese threat actors to operationalize the exploit.\n\n  - Interesting connections to previous activity include the historic use of FF-RAT and\ncommon infrastructure used by NetTraveler, Icefog, and DeputyDog APTs, as well as\nthe MILE TEA campaign.\n\n### Background\n\nFor many years, Tibetan and Uyghur communities have been targeted by many threat\n[actors via ​exploits​, ​phishing​,](https://securelist.com/new-uyghur-and-tibetan-themed-attacks-using-pdf-exploits-45/35465/) [watering hole attacks​](https://securelist.com/central-tibetan-administration-website-strategically-compromised/57476/) ​, and malware exploiting multiple\n[platforms, including ​Windows​, ​MacOS​, and more recently,](https://securelist.com/a-gift-for-dalai-lamas-birthday-23/33351/) [​Android​. Unsurprisingly, the](https://citizenlab.ca/2013/04/permission-to-spy-an-analysis-of-android-malware-targeting-tibetans/)\nattackers include multiple Chinese threat actors, among them the original [​Winnti group​,](https://securelist.com/winnti-stolen-digital-certificates-re-used-in-current-watering-hole-attacks-on-tibetan-and-uyghur-groups-3/35692/)\n[LuckyCat​, and ​NetTraveler​, but also others like ​MiniDuke​](https://www.trendmicro.de/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp_luckycat_redux.pdf) [and ​Equation Group​. Aiding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO-uQ4sih-o)\ntargeted communities allows researchers to discover emerging malicious campaigns while\nprotecting victims, but recurring discovery has done little to ultimately deter attackers.\n\nThe RedAlpha campaigns began in mid-2017 by targeting the Tibetan Community in India.\nThe latest campaign remains ongoing, with new subdomains registered in late April 2018.\nThe threat actor utilized a careful combination of victim reconnaissance and fingerprinting,\nfollowed by selective targeting with multi-stage malware. The malware utilized changed\nfrom a reliable custom toolset in the 2017 campaign to a more cautious and spartan\napproach, ending with commodity malware in 2018. Observing these two campaigns in\nsuccession demonstrates the evolution of a relatively unknown threat actor.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Recorded Future timeline of selected activity from the RedAlpha campaigns._\n\n### Overview of the RedAlpha Campaigns\n\nThe 2017 hktechy campaign, named after one of its command-and-control (C2) servers,\ncommenced in June 2017. It employed two stages of largely custom malware for both 32and 64-bit Windows systems. The first stage was a straightforward dropper designed to\ndownload a payload and establish its persistence as a Windows service.\n\nThe next stage was an infostealer designed to collect system information, compress files\nand entire directories, and exfiltrate them. The malware used a dual C2 infrastructure that\nrelied on an IIS-configured server as well as sending files and information via POST\nrequests to a second server.\n\nWe discovered that the same email address used to register a C2 domain for the 2017\nhktechy campaign was also used to register another domain, which resolved to a Hong\nKong IP. This IP was previously associated with a phishing campaign conducted against\n[Tibetans in 2016 and 2017, ​reported​ earlier this year by Citizen Lab. This overlap in](https://citizenlab.ca/2018/01/spying-on-a-budget-inside-a-phishing-operation-with-targets-in-the-tibetan-community/)\ninfrastructure enabled us to attribute all three campaigns to the same threat actor. The\nhistoric activity demonstrated the group’s wider targeting profile, including government\n\n\n-----\n\nnetworks of South and Southeast Asian countries. The report also highlighted that the\ngroup had spoofed Western webmail and cloud service providers such as Microsoft,\nGoogle, and Yahoo in order to gain access to victim networks.\n\nCitizen Lab assessed that the actor behind the campaign they observed may have been a\n“low-level contractor” who exhibited “sloppy” tradecraft and utilized inexpensive\ninfrastructure. Our observations of the 2017 hktechy campaign demonstrate the attacker’s\nproficiency in using custom malware with redundant communications from the start,\nsuggesting an increased level of sophistication for the attacker.\n\nThe 2018 internetdocss campaign began in January and continued until at least late April\n2018. The campaign revealed a sudden departure from the hktechy toolkit with the custom\nfirst-stage dropper being replaced by a validator-style implant that checked the victim’s\nenvironment and beaconed basic system information to the C2 before attempting any\nfurther drops. The attackers then selectively deployed a piece of commodity malware,\nnjRAT, on specific victim machines. We found both stages communicated with a single C2\nserver for all aspects of the attack campaign, including victim reconnaissance, drops, and\nexfiltration.\n\nThe shift from custom tooling to commodity malware represents a broader shift in\nadversary TTPs that has been observed in the APT research community. Facing greater\nscrutiny, both [​criminal​ and](https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2018GlobalThreatReport.pdf) [​nation-state sponsored​](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/05/22/turla-mosquito-shift-towards-generic-tools/) groups have grown increasingly reliant\non commodity malware and penetration testing tools. This shift represents a dual value\nadd for the attackers: first, by allowing their operations to blend into the greater use of\ncommon tools, and secondly, by lowering their cost of retooling upon discovery.\n\nThe careful and selective targeting exhibited in the 2018 internetdocss campaign supports\nthe theory that a more experienced actor or organization is involved in the ongoing\ncampaign. Immature attackers have a tendency to spray victim institutions, often targeting\nthe same victim multiple times, and foregoing reconnaissance phases in favor of noisy\nsmash-and-grab-style operations.\n\nOur research shows that this group’s targeting is meticulous. Starting with reconnaissance\non a desired victim, by directing them to a legitimate news article via their C2 server, the\nattackers were able to fingerprint the victim’s operating system. Where we’ve observed\nthese drops, only some of those willing to click were served with a carefully crafted lure\nrequesting assistance for a Tibetan scholar. The attachment was an exploit document that\nestablished persistence and deployed the first-stage validator implant.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a final show of attacker discernment, the validator implant will survey the victim\nenvironment for common antivirus solutions,research virtual environments, and establish\na recurring beacon that transmits basic victim system information. This measure of\nprotection was not present in the hktechy campaign’s custom toolkit. The attackers then\ncarefully selected which victims will be served the njRAT commodity malware payload.\n\nSamples associated with either RedAlpha campaign remain quite rare, with less than 20\nsamples identified across the two campaigns. Custom samples are coded in C++. The 2018\ndropper relied on a rare C++ cross-platform framework called [​Haxe​](https://haxe.org/) to string together\npieces of publicly available source code largely found in Chinese-language forums and\nblogs.\n\nWe uncovered a myriad of intertwining infrastructure used during the RedAlpha campaigns\nand possibly for their older operations which we have drawn together in the Maltego chart\nbelow:\n\n_RedAlpha campaign infrastructure 2017–2018._\n\n\n-----\n\n### Technical Analysis\n\n##### Malware and Tooling\n The Hktechy Campaign (Mid-2017)\n\nWe assess that the RedAlpha campaigns began with the hktechy campaign in mid-2017.\nThe infection vector is currently unknown but used custom multi-stage malware — a\nstraightforward dropper and a payload. The dropper established persistence for the\ninfostealer payload as a Windows service. Both stages are available for both 32- and 64-bit\nWindows systems. A single sample of an improved standalone 64-bit infostealer (NetHelp\nStriker) is also described below.\n\n2017: Audio Droppers\n\n**MD5** cb71f3b4f08eba58857532ac90bac77d\n\n**SHA1** 3142029872c39f393e765d59d68cf4f912170629\n\n**SHA256** e94284e487e59b53efab9d4584fca766883b916118c9a8ff59514087555e9a8e\n\n**imphash** 3697a1f9150de181026ce089c10657c3\n\n**Compilation** June 11, 2017 (06:40:50)\n**Timestamp**\n\n**Type** PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n**Size** 93KB\n\n**Filename** “wordx86.exe” or “audiox86.exe”\n\n**C2** doc.internetdocss[.]com\n\nThe dropper attempted to establish its own persistence as a startup file.

It\nreplicated the persistence functionality of the word(x32|x86).exe dropper, which\nestablished nethelp.dll as a service (\"Windows Internet Help\") run by svchost.exe. That\nfunctionality could then be accessed via a new export named “install.”\n\nAdditionally, this new version no longer relied on the availability of WinRar (rar.exe) to\ncompress entire directories. The infostealer now monitored changes in file size and sent\nupdated copies of files to the C2 server.\n\nFinally, the hktechy domain was replaced with striker.internetdocss[.]com from which this\nvariant gets its name.\n\n##### Internetdocss Campaign (2018–Present)\n\nThe RedAlpha internetdocss campaign started in January 2018. A confirmed infection\nvector is the use of an exploit lure document delivered via a social engineering email\nrequesting help for a Tibetan scholar. The campaign relies exclusively on a single C2,\nminimalist tooling, and more selective infections. The exploit doc installs a custom\nvalidator-style implant strung together from publicly available source code along with a\ncross-platform C++ framework. The attackers then select which infected victims are worth a\nsecond-stage payload. The sole second-stage drop identified in this campaign consisted of\ncommodity RAT.\n\n2018 Infection Vector\n\n|MD5|5228914b534a437eb7985702e78772be|\n|---|---|\n|SHA1|83d7ceb2e55ae3d6bbf0936376e82fe5bc97a963|\n|SHA256|02bf5fdb11eee6ede01cc061206fe98f60a6b5c90ffead31e8f0a87ccfa414ef|\n|Last modified timestamp|January 10, 2018 (21:16:00)|\n|Size|798KB|\n|Type|RTF Doc with embedded OLE + Exploits: CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0802|\n|Language Resources|English — United States Arabic — Saudi Arabia Chinese — People's Republic of China|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe lure document is weaponized to exploit the Microsoft Office Equation Editor in order 3\n\nto load an embedded DLL.

The first stage is no longer a naïve\ndropper — instead, the attackers have chosen to validate their victims before deploying\nfurther malware. The implant surveys the machine for antimalware products and then\nprofiles the victim machine, and the beaconing information is then collected at a C2 server.\nThe attackers can then selectively leverage their next stage payload.\n\nThe coding of the malware itself is noteworthy for its unsophisticated cut-and-splice\n[efficiency. It’s compiled for C++, using the ​Haxe​](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe) cross-platform framework. Most of the\nexecution flow is clumped together in a single main function. Essential functionality\nappears to have been copied from different pieces of open source code found in Chinese\nblogs and forums as shown below.\n\n|MD5|e28db08b2326a34958f00d68dfb034b0|\n|---|---|\n|SHA1|28bc84813b9dec660fe95d590ef33e574fe16254|\n|SHA256|50a28a8ebc68b6c608a073278fbb4255912bf41fd0970192d439097af4670f81|\n|imphash|17030637d18335c7267d09ec0ebc637c|\n|Compilation Timestamp|January 07, 2018 (23:13:23)|\n|Type|PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows|\n|Size|274KB|\n|Filename|winlogon.exe|\n|C2|http://doc.internetdocss[.]com/index?|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|MD5: e28db08b2326a34958f00d68dfb034b0|Partial Source: http://dreamisx.blog.163.com/blog/static/11500483920128 98257606|\n\n\nMD5:\ne28db08b2326a34958f00d68dfb034b0\n\n\n_Determining OS version and exact comparison list._\n\nPartial Source:\n[http://www.borlandforum.com/impboard/impboard.dll?action=r](http://www.borlandforum.com/impboard/impboard.dll?action=read&db=bcb_tip&no=1168)\n[ead&db=bcb_tip&no=1168](http://www.borlandforum.com/impboard/impboard.dll?action=read&db=bcb_tip&no=1168)\n\n_WMI checks for security products._\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|MD5: e28db08b2326a34958f00d68dfb034b0|Partial Source: http://www.borlandforum.com/impboard/impboard.dll?action=r ead&db=bcb_tip&no=1168|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe implant beacons lightly obfuscated user information and the OS version at regular\nintervals to the doc.internetdocss[.]com C2 server.\n\n2018 Custom Dropper Variants\n\nc94a39d58450b81087b4f1f5fd304add **Type​: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows**\n**Filename​: N/A**\n\n3a2b1a98c0a31ed32759f48df34b4bc8 **Type​: PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows**\n**Filename​: qww.exe**\n\n##### njRAT — Second-Stage Payload\n\nWe were able to identify a single case of a next-stage drop.

It does, however,\ndisplay some similarities in coding style with the 2018 internetdocss campaign. Like the\ninternetdocss validator, the malware described by Citizen Lab was coded in C++ and relied\non a cross-platform framework (in this case, Qt version 4, instead of Haxecpp). Further\nsimilar characteristics include the malware described by Citizen Lab acting as a filestealer\nthat communicates with a single C2 server to steal files from the victim machine, and\nrelying on the GBK codec for conversion to and from Chinese characters.\n\n##### Infrastructure\n The Hktechy Campaign (Mid-2017)\n\nThe hktechy campaign in 2017 utilized a dropper configured to communicate with the C2\ndomain doc.internetdocss[.]com. This dropper was leveraged to deliver the NetHelp\nInfostealer payload that was configured to communicate with two further C2 domains,\nwww.hktechy[.]com and index.ackques[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Summary of 2017 hktechy campaign infrastructure._\n\nPassive DNS resolutions reveal that doc.internetdocss[.]com first resolved to Japanese IP\n220.218.70[.]160 on June 28, 2017, only a few weeks after the original dropper was\ncompiled on June 11.

This cert was active on the\n27.126.179[.]159 Forewin IP when it had tk.u2xu2[.]com pointing to it.\n\nThis enabled us to identify http.ackques[.]com, a sibling of the 2017 NetHelp infostealer C2\ndomain index.ackques[.]com, resolving to the same IP 27.126.179[.]159, thus reaffirming\nthat ​27.126.179[.]156 – 27.126.179[.]160​ is a netblock likely managed by the same threat\nactors behind the RedAlpha campaigns. ​Common SSL certificates and sibling domains\namong the same small netblock are strong indicators that that this small netblock was\nadministered by the same group.\n\n##### Hong Kong IP 122.10.84[.]146\n\nAs we stated previously, doc.internetdocss[.]com resolved to this Hong Kong IP between\nFebruary 8, 2018 and March 27, 2018.

This is a variant of the custom first\nstage dropper used in the RedAlpha 2018 internetdocss campaign.\n\n  - MD5: ​3a2b1a98c0a31ed32759f48df34b4bc8​ (​“q​ww.exe”). This is an alternate\nfirst-stage validator that includes a second stage payload that drops njRAT.\n\n  - Likely related to the “qww.exe” validator. We discovered a version of njRAT (also\nknown as Bladibindi) hosted on the same 122.10.84[.]146 Hong Kong IP (filename\nserverdo7468.exe, MD5: ​c74608c70a59371cbf016316bebfab06). ​\n\n##### Targeting\n The Tibetans Aren’t the Only Targets\n\nThe domain registrant for RedAlpha’s 2017 campaign C2, hktechy[.]com, was\nsteven-jain@outlook[.]com. Pivoting on this email address reveals it was also used to\nregister a similar domain, angtechy[.]com, on June 20, 2017. Angtechy[.]com continues to\nresolve to Hong Kong IP 115.126.39[.]107 which has hosted over 60 domains since\nmid-2015.\n\nMany of these domains were spoofing specific organizations such as the Office of His\nHoliness the Dalai Lama (webmail-dalailama[.]com), the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defense\n(mail-defense[.]tk), and a Chinese online car auction site (mail-youxinpai[.]com) as shown in\nthe table below. Other domains hosted on 115.126.39[.]107 included spoofs of generic\nwebmail and cloud services provided by Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Malicious Domain|Spoofed Organization|\n|---|---|\n|cqledu[.]com|China National Hotel Education Network (cqledi.org)|\n|mail-aol[.]space|AOL webmail (mail.aol.com)|\n|drlve-gooog1e[.]com|Google Drive (drive.google.com)|\n|login-live[.]space|Microsoft Live (login.live.com)|\n|mail-dsi-go[.]space|Department of Special Investigations, Ministry of Justice of Thailand (mail.dsi.go.th)|\n|mail-epochtimes[.]space|Epoch Times, founded by Chinese-American Falun Gong practitioners (mail.epochtimes.com)|\n|mail-defense[.]tk|Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence (mail.defence.lk)|\n|webmail-dalailama[.]com|Official website of His Holiness the Dalai Lama (webmail.dalailama.com)|\n|mail.youxinpai[.]com|Youxinpai (Beijing) Information Technology Co., Ltd.

The\ninfrastructure overlap associating the campaigns reported by Citizen Lab with the hktechy\ncampaign provides strong evidence that the same threat actor may be responsible for the\ntargeting of the Tibetan Community and other victims from as early as 2015.\n\n##### Indian Targeting?\n\nMetadata analysis of the researched Hong Kong IP 122.10.84[.]146 revealed that between\nApril 2 and April 23, repeated SSL connections were made with two IPs in India\n(103.245.22[.]117, 103.245.22[.]124) that resolve to MahaOnline services. MahaOnline is an\ne-portal for the [​Government of Maharashtra​, a state in Western India for which Mumbai is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Maharashtra)\nthe capital. The e-portal enables citizens to access civil services and hosts domains such as\nswayam.mahaonline.gov[.]in (a tribal development program website) and\nmolpg.mahaonline.gov[.]in (an online payment gateway).\n\nWhile we have not directly observed any malicious communications between the Hong\nKong IP 122.10.84[.]146 and the Mahaonline IPs, the volume of connections from the\n\n\n-----\n\nMahaonline IPs to port 443 on the Hong Kong C2 may indicate the successful targeting of\nthe e-portal. In addition, there are no legitimate services hosted on the Hong Kong C2 that\ncould explain these connections.\n\n### Threat Actor\n\n##### Links to FF-RAT Use and Chinese APTs\n\nAs highlighted previously, a shared SSL certificate was present on Hong Kong IP\n27.126.179[.]159 when it hosted tk.u2xu2[.]com. Exploring historical DNS resolutions, we\nfound tk.u2xu2[.]com resolved to Hong Kong IP 103.20.193[.]156 between June 2016 and\nNovember 2016.\n\nThis IP was registered to Shenzhen Katherine Heng Technology Information Company Ltd.\nDuring the same time window, we found that malicious MD5:\n83ffd697edd0089204779f5bfb031023 was communicating with tk.u2xu2[.]com.\n\nThe ReversingLabs [​enrichment​ in Recorded Future confirmed that](https://www.recordedfuture.com/partner-spotlight-reversinglabs/)\n83ffd697edd0089204779f5bfb031023 was first observed in the wild in June 2016, assigning\nit a “65” risk rating and classifying it under the Tiniwen malware family. Tiniwen is more\nwidely known as FF-RAT which has been around since at least 2012, with public reporting of\nFF-RAT exclusively associating it with Chinese APT activity.\n\n[In 2015, the FBI ​reportedly​ highlighted FF-RAT as “one of the more effective tools” leveraged](https://thehackernews.com/2015/09/stealthy-malware-cyber-attack.html)\nduring the successful targeting of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), widely\nbelieved to have been conducted by a Chinese APT.\n\nFurthermore, in its June 2017 [​research​](https://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/breaking-down-ff-rat-malware.html) paper, Cylance documented an instance of FF-RAT\nwhich was configured to communicate with C2 tk.u2xu2[.]com. Based on the associations\ndrawn here, we assess FF-RAT was likely used by the same threat actors behind RedAlpha,\npossibly as early as 2016.\n\nFinally, ​according to WHOIS data, ​13316874955@163[.]com was used to register the Hong\nKong IP ​103.20.193[.]156. This email address has registered at least another 125 IP\naddresses, all at Shenzhen Katherine Heng Technology Information Company Ltd, with\nseveral of the IPs tagged for linkages to Chinese APT groups such as NetTraveler, Icefog, 6\n\nand DeputyDog:\n\n6 Using RiskIQ’s indicator OSINT enrichments.\n\n\n-----\n\n  - 103.30.7[.]76; NetTraveler; Kaspersky\n\n  - 103.30.7[.]77; NetTraveler; Kasperksy\n\n  - 103.20.192[.]59; NetTraveler; Kaspersky\n\n  - 103.20.195[.]140; Icefog; Kaspersky\n\n  - 103.20.192[.]4; DeputyDog; FireEye\n\n  - [103.20.192[.]248; MILE TEA campaign; ​Palo Alto Networks](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/09/mile-tea-cyber-espionage-campaign-targets-asia-pacific-businesses-and-government-agencies/?es_p=2616669)\n\n##### Indicator of Possible PLA Involvement\n\nOne of the domains, cqyrxy[.]com, that historically resolved to 115.126.39[.]107, was\nregistered with the contact name “ren minjie.” Interestingly, “Ren Minjie” is the English\ntransliterated spelling of ​人民 (Renmin) and 解 (Jie), with 解 (Jie) likely being the abbreviation\nof 解放军 (Jiefangjun).\n\nJiefangjun is translated to “The Chinese People’s Liberation Army” (PLA), and therefore, “Ren\nMinjie” is likely a transliterated shorthand for the PLA. It is unclear whether this is an\nintentional false-flag planted in the registration details for the domain, or if it is merely the\nresult of sloppy behavior by the threat actor unveiling the possible identity of the\nperpetrating organization.\n\n##### Links to Nanjing Qinglan Information Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nWe also uncovered links to a Chinese information security company called Nanjing Qinglan\nInformation Technology Co., Ltd (南京青苜信息技术有限公司).\n\nMalicious domains drive-mail-google[.]com and drive-accounts-gooogle[.]com were listed in\nthe accompanying IOC deck released by Citizen Lab with its January 2018 report. Both\ndomains were registered using QQ email 6060841@qq[.]com. We found this email address\nwas listed as the contact for a job advertisement on Chinese jobsite www.52pojie[.]cn, for\nan “information security engineer” for “Nanjing Qinglan Information Technology Co., Ltd.”\nThe associated name for the QQ account was listed as “Mr. Liang.”\n\nAccording to an official [​document​ listed on the Nanjing provincial government website,](http://jxw.nanjing.gov.cn/govinfo/201607/W020160719404522388738.doc)\nNanjing Qinglan Information Technology Co., Ltd. is a Nanjing-based company providing “...\nsecurity assessment, security reinforcement, penetration testing, security consulting,\noffensive and defensive drills, security training.” The company has a decent web presence\n(​hXXp://www.cimer.com[.]cn) ​indicating it is an established entity, however, the association\nof two malicious domains used in the targeting of the Tibetan Community to an\ninformation security company that conducts offensive “drills” is interesting.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Job advertisement on hXXps://www.52pojie[.]cn/thread-93849-1-1.html noting 6060841@qq[.]com._\n\n### Outlook\n\nOur research uncovered two new campaigns conducted by a Chinese APT against the\nTibetan Community in 2017 and 2018.\n\nWe do not currently possess enough evidence to categorically prove that the RedAlpha\ncampaigns were conducted by a new threat actor. Other than the excellent Citizen Lab\nreporting, there is a dearth of public material linking the malware and TTPs detailed in our\nresearch to an existing threat actor. We have outlined some tentative connections, through\ninfrastructure registrations to existing Chinese APTs, but a firm attribution requires further\ndetail on the individuals and organizations behind the malicious activity.\n\nThe use of previously undisclosed custom malware in the hktechy campaign alongside the\ndemonstrable evolution of their tradecraft in the internetdocss campaign indicate that the\nthreat actor has a skillful capability development program for malware and tooling —\nsomething that is likely to be sponsored by a well-resourced nation state. We also observed\nthe group tactically exploiting new vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-0199) during a time window in\nwhich the Chinese national vulnerability database (CNNVD) deliberately chose to delay its\ndisclosure of the vulnerability to the public. In the past year, we have reported extensively\n[on the ​influence​](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-mss-vulnerability-influence/) of the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) on the CNNVD which points\n\n\n-----\n\nto the withholding of [​high-risk vulnerabilities​ from public disclosure being done to possibly](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-vulnerability-data-altered/)\nenable offensive cyberespionage operations.\n\nUncovering the possible OPSEC failure by the perpetrators behind the RedAlpha\ncampaigns, where they registered a domain using an abbreviation of the “People’s\nLiberation Army,” was an intriguing development. This, along with the infrastructure\noverlap with Chinese APT groups Icefog, NetTraveler, DeputyDog, and those behind the\nMILE TEA campaign, in addition to the links to the Nanjing Qinglan Information Technology\ncompany, point to a Chinese origin for the threat actors behind the RedAlpha activity.\nFurther enforcing the case is their likely use of FF-RAT, which has almost exclusively been\nreported as used by sophisticated Chinese threat actors.\n\nThe selective targeting of organizations should be a cause for concern for all governments\nand civil groups based in the region. We found that the group’s activities weren’t the first\ntargeted attacks against the Five Poisons and undoubtedly will not be the last, particularly\nin the case of civil groups, NGOs, and charities. The lack of investment in network defense\nfor many such organizations inevitably reduces their ability to defend against such attacks\nfrom well-resourced and motivated threat actors.\n\nWidespread monitoring and censorship of the Tibetan community and the other Five\nPoisons continues to be of vital importance to the Chinese state. Any perceived threat to\nthe ongoing rule of the Communist Party of China (CPC) is treated as a matter of national\nsecurity; therefore, it is unsurprising to uncover cyberespionage operations targeting such\ncivil organizations. Furthermore, the associated targeting of neighboring South and\nSoutheastern governments indicates that the threat actor could be working to broaden\nCPC requirements that could evolve depending on geopolitical events. The use of\npreviously undisclosed malware and infrastructure by this threat actor, along with the\nscarcity of public and private reporting relating to the TTPs outlined here in our research,\nleads us to believe that we have uncovered a little-known threat actor, likely attributed to\nthe Chinese state.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Appendix A — Indicators of Compromise**\n\n5228914b534a437eb7985702e78772be\ne6c0ac26b473d1e0fa9f74fdf1d01af8\ne28db08b2326a34958f00d68dfb034b0\n3a2b1a98c0a31ed32759f48df34b4bc8\nc94a39d58450b81087b4f1f5fd304add\nc74608c70a59371cbf016316bebfab06\ncb71f3b4f08eba58857532ac90bac77d\n1412102eda0c2e5a5a85cb193dbb1524\n42256b4753724f7feb411bc9912155fd\n6d1d6987d0677f40e473befab121ab1b\n8f0fe2620f8dadf93eee285834e35655\ncd32ce54ed94dfbde7fb85930a16597d\nc6e336550bd1c087ee2a211781fd9280\nd4ea9027edca1d01c62d9f43a2975d30\n6dd1be1e491d5bf9cd14686c185c3009\n\n220x218x70x160.ap220.ftth.ucom.ne[.]jp\nangtechy[.]com\napple.internetdocss[.]com\nartvoice.internetdocss[.]com\nblog.tibetcul.internetdocss[.]com\nbusiness.internetdocss[.]com\ncfr.internetdocss[.]com\nchinaaid.internetdocss[.]com\nCqledu[.]com\ncqyrxy[.]com\ndoc.internetdocss[.]com\ndocs.internetdocss[.]com\ndrlve-gooog1e[.]com\nepochtimes.internetdocss[.]com\nhttp.ackques[.]com\nindex.ackques[.]com\nitem.internetdocss[.]com\nlogin-live[.]space\nmail-aol[.]space\nmail-defense[.]tk\nmail-dsi-go[.]space\nmail-epochtimes[.]space\nmail.youxinpai[.]com\nndtv.internetdocss[.]com\noc.internetdocss[.]com\nplshl[.]com\nrediff.internetdocss[.]com\nsavetibet.internetdocss[.]com\nsp.u2xu2[.]com\nstriker.internetdocss[.]com\nthewire.internetdocss[.]com\ntibet.internetdocss[.]com\ntk.u2xu2[.]com\ntootopia.internetdocss[.]com\nu2xu2[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nvideo.internetdocss[.]com\nvot.internetdocss[.]com\nwebmail-mpt[.]space\nwengiguowengui[.]space\nwww.apple.internetdocss[.]com\nwww.doc.internetdocss[.]com\nwww.hktechy[.]com\n\n115.126.39[.]107\n122.10.84[.]146\n142.4.62[.]249\n144.48.220[.]167\n198.44.172[.]97\n211.44.63[.]39\n220.218.70[.]160\n27.126.179[.]156\n27.126.179[.]157\n27.126.179[.]158\n27.126.179[.]159\n27.126.179[.]160\n45.77.250[.]80\n\nsteven-jain@outlook[.]com\n13316874955@163[.]com\n6060841@qq[.]com\n\n**Appendix B —** **[​Yara Rules](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/apt_ZZ_RedAlpha_all.yar)**\n\n**2017 Campaign**\n\nimport \"pe\"\n\nrule apt_ZZ_RedAlpha_2017Campaign_Dropper\n{\nmeta:\ndesc = \"RedAlpha 2017 Campaign, Dropper\"\nauthor = \"JAG-S, Insikt Group, RecordedFuture\"\nTLP = \"White\"\nmd5_x86 = \"cb71f3b4f08eba58857532ac90bac77d\"\nmd5_x64 = \"1412102eda0c2e5a5a85cb193dbb1524\"\n\nstrings:\n$drops1 = \"http://doc.internetdocss.com/nethelp x86.dll\" ascii wide\n$drops2 = \"http://doc.internetdocss.com/audio x86.exe\" ascii wide\n$drops3 = \"http://doc.internetdocss.com/nethelp x64.dll\" ascii wide\n$drops4 = \"http://doc.internetdocss.com/audio x64.exe\" ascii wide\n\n$source1 = \"http://doc.internetdocss.com/word x86.exe\" ascii wide\n$source2 = \"http://doc.internetdocss.com/word x64.exe\" ascii wide\n\n\n-----\n\n$path1 = \"\\\\Programs\\\\Startup\\\\audio.exe\" ascii wide\n$path2 = \"c:\\\\Windows\\\\nethelp.dll\" ascii wide\n\n$persistence1 = \"SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\svchost\" ascii\nwide\n$persistence2 = \"%SystemRoot%\\\\system32\\\\svchost.exe -k \" ascii wide\n$persistence3 = \"SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\\" ascii wide\n$persistence4 = \"Parameters\" ascii wide\n$persistence5 = \"ServiceDll\" ascii wide\n$persistence6 = \"NetHelp\" ascii wide\n$persistence7 = \"Windows Internet Help\" ascii wide\n\ncondition:\nuint16(0)==0x5A4D\nand\nfilesize < 500KB\nand\n(\n(pe.imphash() == \"3697a1f9150de181026ce089c10657c3\" or pe.imphash() ==\n\"e6e566fc8a1dee3019821e84c5ad58cc\")\nor\n(\nany of ($drops*)\nor\nany of ($source*)\nor\nany of ($path*)\nor\n6 of ($persistence*)\n)\n)\n}\n\nrule apt_ZZ_RedAlpha_2017Campaign_nethelp\n{\n\nmeta:\ndesc = \"RedAlpha 2017 Campaign, NetHelp Drop\"\nauthor = \"JAG-S, Insikt Group, RecordedFuture\"\nTLP = \"White\"\nmd5_x86 = \"42256b4753724f7feb411bc9912155fd\"\nmd5_x86 = \"6d1d6987d0677f40e473befab121ab1b\"\nmd5_x64 = \"8f0fe2620f8dadf93eee285834e35655\"\nmd5_x64 = \"cd32ce54ed94dfbde7fb85930a16597d\"\nmd5_x64_striker = \"6dd1be1e491d5bf9cd14686c185c3009\"\n\nstrings:\n\n$postreq1 = \"POST /index.html HTTP/1.1\" ascii wide\n$postreq2 = \"Host: index.ackques.com\" ascii wide\n$postreq3 = \"User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1;
