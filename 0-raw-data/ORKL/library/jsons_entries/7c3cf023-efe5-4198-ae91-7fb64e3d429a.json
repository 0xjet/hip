As modern technology\nhas developed, both the corporate aspects and technical aspects of the oil & gas industry have become heavily\nreliant on the Cyber domain. The inherently insecure origins and evolution of computing has led that dependence\nto become a severe vulnerability. Recent events have brought this fact to light with a deluge of “cyber attacks”\nlaunched globally against the industry. These attacks raise specter of cyber conflict and the question of culpabil­\nity. This report seeks to analyze a selection of these events, looking for patterns that would indicate one or more\nadvanced actors. By observing the motives means and opportunities presented to actors, and looking at a cross\nsection of these attacks over time, conclusions will be drawn as to the past, present, and future of cyber conflict\nwithin the industry.\n\nThe US Army notes in their Cyber Concept & Capabilities plan for 2016-2028 that cyber capabilities pose a unique\nand attractive opportunity to an inferior enemy to gain equivalence temporary equivalence with a superior enemy\nthrough the use of Cyber. This applies not only to nation states, but non-state actors as well. There are several fac­\ntors compounding this issue:\n\n - Unfettered access to the infrastructure and tools used to conduct cyber operations by anyone\n\n - A low barrier to entry fiscally and limited experience required to achieve an outsized impact\n\n - A high and attractive return on investment\n\n - Plausible deniability due to issues with attribution\n\nThese facts make it highly likely that multiple foreign agencies as well as powerful corporate denizens have used\nand continue to make use of cyber capabilities to affect favorable outcomes.\n\n**Methods: Using OSINT techniques, information was gathered from government websites, corporate websites,**\nnews agencies, and search engine queries. This information was then synthesized and scrutinized for possible links\nand attribution. By looking at the surrounding geopolitical events, gains and losses as well as indirect outcomes,\nevents can be correlated and attributed to actors which possess the means motive and opportunity to do so. The\nprimary purpose is to analyze the event regardless of attribution. Because of the nature of open source informa­\ntion, biases are naturally introduced which must be acknowledged, if not accounted for.\n\n**Events: Incidents were selected based on relevance and their timeliness, along with other factors discussed in the**\nmethodology. Incidents were largely grouped into one of three categories: espionage, sabotage, and incidental/\nmiscellaneous. While these incidents do not qualify as warfare by the Clausewitz definition, they are a form of\nconflict.\n\n**Cyber Espionage: There is significant evidence of protracted, insidious espionage carried out by a state actor within**\nthe cyber realm. China has likely launch hundreds of cyber attacks against the oil and gas industry since as early as\n2002. With the advent of Red October, they may not be the only actors in the game. With a level of sophistication\nnot yet observed publicly in this realm, Red October could represent an evolution to China’s current techniques, or\nanother actor entering the game. By looking at some of the technical aspects of the events, a link was established\nbetween Byzantine Candor and APT1, as well as a possible link between the Mirage Campaign and Elderwood Proj­\nect.\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom events which do not directly relate to the oil industry, a series of sabotage incidents using cyber as the medium are\nexamined. It is possible that there events were salvos between nation states in an example of bidirectional conflict. If this\nis not the case, and incidents like Shamoon were simply the act of non-state actors, then it represents affirmation of the\nrevelence of non-state actors in future cyber conflict. This is only logical since most of America’s critical infrastructure is\ncontrolled by the private sector, and economic influence can be leveraged to gain great power.\n\n**Incidental: By taking an adversarial look at the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, an example of how a state actor could act in**\na violent, kinetic way against a non-state through cyber while remaining anonymous is examined through a vignette. It\nis determined that while the Deepwater horizon spill was not an attack, it easily could have been. This type of conflict is\nboth deadly and catastrophic, and while it is unlikely to be used lightly, it sets the tone for possibilities going forward.\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nBased on the observed events, the possible threat actors, and the correlation of these events, it appears that\nthere is ongoing cyber conflict within the oil industry. The correlation of several incidents has shown coordinated attacks\nby an advanced foreign threat actor against multiple entities with the use of espionage. It has also suggested the pos­\nsibility of more destructive attacks, and pointed out the benefits to both state actors and non-state actors within the oil\nindustry. In some cases there has been an obvious alignment of political, strategic, operational, and tactical goals and\nprincipals to affect favorable outcomes. The culmination of these findings is that there are many threat actors who are\ncurrently engaged in, or may be engaged in, ongoing conflict which may have the potential to escalate. This should be\nboth a primary concern and a cause for future research and analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Introduction\n\nRecent events of national significance within the oil & gas Industry have brought to light both the question of\ndefining threat sources and that of plausibly attributing known events to a threat source. The unprecedented rise in cy­\nber events begets the question of whether this is incidental to the continued advancement of technology, or suggests an\nongoing conflict that may escalate. This report will aggregate relevant events, present criteria for outlining threat origins,\nand determine the likelihood that the incidents are related. It also seeks to determine whether or not any observed cor­\nrelation points to a persistent aggressor or simply circumstantial coincidence. The purpose of this analysis is to provide\ndecision-makers with a clearer idea of the current security outlook for the oil and gas industry, and pinpoint what current\nand future causes for concern appear to be. All events and presented options should be considered cautiously and as\nempirically as possible; any assumptions that are made will be explicitly stated.\n\n#### Timeline of Events\n\nOne of the first priorities is to outline a timeline of events which have occurred and then examine what signifi­\ncance they may have or relationships they may share in order to scope the conversation. These events will constitute\nthe frame for the analysis. Events were chosen after a preliminary overview of content from open sources such as\nestablished news media sites, oil & gas company websites, Google query results, government bulletins, and technical\nreports by security companies. From this brief overview, events within the Oil and Gas Industry which exhibited a “cyber”\ncomponent were selected. These events are not meant to be all inclusive, and due to the entirely open source nature of\nthe resources, the vantage point on the information may be biased and in many instances is likely incomplete. However\neven an incomplete view may contain enough information to identify significant patterns, and by acknowledging the\nquality concerns with the information, a more accurate and objective analysis may be performed. Below is a timeline of\nobserved events which will be discussed in greater detail. The timeline will list the event and the apparent target of the\nevent.\n\n\n-----\n\n**US**\n\n\n211,169 MMbbl\n\n**Top 20 Countries**\n**Proven Oil Reserves**\n\n\n###### 17\n\n\n**Significant Open-Source Cyber-Related Incidents within Oil & Gas Industries**\n\n**[2008-2013]***\n0 MMbbl\n\nCyber Espionage **1** **2** **4** **5** **7** **8** **9** **11** **14** **17 [18]**\n\n**19**\n\nSabotage **3** **10** **13** **15**\n\nIncidental/Misc **6** **12** **16**\n\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\n\n**Sophisticated infection and data exfiltrationin Iraq of corporate secrets suspected to be part of the Night Dragon campaign**\n\n**Earliest known intrusion of Shady RAT in the Gas industry–sophisticated infection and data exfiltration of corporate secrets**\n\n**A disgrunted former contractor for PER intentionally disables offshore oil rig safety controls remotely off the coast of California**\n\n**McAfee starts monitoring the Night Dragon cyber espionage campaign against oil, energy, and petrochemical companies**\n\n**Symantec ties back a Google hack to a campaign referred to as the Elderwood Project that targets Oil/Gas targets amongst others**\n\n**Deepwater Horizon Oil Rig suffers catastrophic failure; Control safety Systems had been rendered inhibited**\n\n**BG Group Plc and CHK. are alleged to be victim of sophisticated data exfiltration of corporate secrets reported by Bloomberg**\n\n**Talisman Energy & Halliburton Co. are targeted by the comment group as part of a corporate espionage campaign**\n\n**Sophisticated infection and data exfiltration of corporate secrets from unspecified oil & gas companies in Norway**\n\n**Virus infects a series control systems on Kharg Island, Iran’s main oil exportation station, causing them to shut down the terminals**\n\n**Dell’s Counter Threat Unit begins tracking the Mirage cyber espionage campaign—Sophisticated data exfiltration of corporate secrets**\n\n**Anonymous hackers target oil industry giants, exposing more than 1,000 email credentials**\n\n**Shamoon virus systematically exfiltrates corporate data and wiped hard drives of over 30,000 computers at Saudi’s Aramco**\n\n**Sophisticated infection and data exfiltration of corporate secrets from Telvent, ltd.**\n\n**Virus infects a series control systems on Kharg Island, Iran’s main oil exportation station, causing them to shut down the terminals**\n\n**Anonymous announces their intent to attack international oil companies in “#OpFuelStrike”**\n\n**Kaspersky announces Red October, a highly flexible cyber espionage virus which targets, amongst others, global oil & gas companies**\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven this data set, a natural escalation of events appears to occur, with the frequency of incidents continuing\nto rise. This can partially be explained by a growing international awareness of the vulnerabilities and perils involved in\ninternet-facing control systems of all kinds; as events occur, they garner additional attention and therefore induce ad­\nditional incidents.\n\nHowever, there are other interesting observations to be made from this data. Largely, the incidents of great note\nhave occurred in either North America or the Middle East. When considering that three of the top five oil producing\ncountries are in these regions (Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Iran), this is not surprising. Yet substantive reports\nof similar incidents are markedly absent in the other two of the top five oil producing countries (China and Russia), and\nthis is noteworthy. The argument could be made that this is due to language barriers and tight control on information\ndissemination, but it is improbable that a significant incident would have gone entirely unnoticed by all media outlets. As\nthe incidents themselves make apparent, human threat actors are involved, and what remains to be identified is whether\nthere is the complexity, overarching coordination, or recurring threat source that would point to an advanced threat such\nas a state actor or complex non-state actor.\n\nBefore continuing with the possible attribution of events, some base discussion and criteria for the threat sourc­\nes must be established. A threat source is considered to be a human-based or natural entity which possesses a capabil­\nity that aligns with an unmitigated vulnerability. The threat sources which will be considered must meet the minimum\nrequirement of having both the motive and the means to carry out the attack. Once a hypothesis consisting of these ele­\nments is established, it will be scrutinized to determine whether or not the events surrounding the incident or series of\nincidents align in any obvious political, strategic, operational and tactical manner. The means in this case consists of both\nthe opportunity and the technological capability to cause the incident to occur, and the motives that will be considered\nare economic gain, retribution, or political agenda (to include ideology).\n\nThe US Army notes in their Cyber Concept & Capabilities plan for 2016-2028 that cyber capabilities pose a\nunique and attractive opportunity to an inferior, asymmetric enemy to temporarily gain equivalence with a superior en­\nemy because of its relatively low initial cost, high return on investment, and plausible deniability due to issues with attri­\nbution. Because of this fact, it is highly likely that multiple foreign agencies as well as powerful corporate denizens have\nused and continue to make use of cyber capabilities to affect favorable outcomes. The rest of the report will attempt to\nsubstantiate this claim through critical analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Methods\n\nTo reach the conclusions presented in the ensuing report incidents were collected and chosen based on the\ninclusion of cyber either as the medium for the event, or as some component factor that played a direct or otherwise\ninstrumental role in the outcome. After collecting a sampling of incidents into a dataset, these incidents were examined\nand several directly attributable features/impacts were taken into account, including:\n\n - The victim(s) targeted\n\n - Evidence of cyber involvement\n\n - Economic losses\n\n - Fatalities incurred\n\n - Geopolitical impacts\n\nBeyond the direct impacts, it was also necessary to consider possible indirect “ripple” effects. For example, it could be\nimportant to consider something like the prices of crude oil prior to and after a given incident. A circumstance may be\nsuch that particular companies or countries unaffected by the incident would find themselves benefiting from a ripple\neffect like higher crude prices. Other effects to identify include changes in the status of the involved companies through­\nout an incident. This could involve looking at earnings reports, the selling or buying of assets, or any legal actions the\ncompany is involved in, as well as contextual events that are significant or contentious and occur directly prior to or after\nan incident.\n\nThrough the investigation of these outcomes and contexts, there is the possibility of finding correlations be­\ntween various incidents. These correlations may be made plain by observable patterns among the details of the events.\nAn observed pattern may suggest a recurring actor—these patterns include tactical and methodical similarities between\nalleged attacks, recurring targets, entities that directly or indirectly benefitted or incurred losses as an outcome, and geo­\ngraphic dispersion or closeness of the events. In cases where an attack is apparent, tactical elements such as tools were\nscrutinized as well, as a means of attribution. For example, a tool may unintentionally exhibit cultural tendencies such as\nthe language used, colloquialisms, idioms, religious preference, and recurring personal habits of the creator or operator.\nThese signatures coupled with aspects of the tactical assets like exclusiveness (as in the case of a purchased domain used\nas a C2 point) can significantly raise the confidence level of an attribution.\n\nPossible actors in the cyber exchange can ostensibly be identified from these correlations. If it is determined\nthat the incident was an attack, motives of the potential actors can be considered. A key element of this that should be\nconsidered is any precedence for the attack. The history of political relationships between countries, such as any ex­\npressed hostilities or allegiances and treaties, may also prove relevant. History also tells us that most conflicts arise over\nthe acquisition of resources. As such, the energy resources and requirements of nation-states must be analyzed. For ex­\nample, is the entity being examined a major importer or exporter of oil? Is the entity capable of energy self-sufficiency?\nOr has the country been experiencing a major influx in energy demand? This information can then be aggregated and\nsynthesized into a more informed view of the event.\n\nA final major component of the analysis was the examination of whether the motives and methods align with\nthe actor’s strategic culture. This includes defining the overall strategic theories that the country adheres to and goals it\ndesires to accomplish. As mentioned earlier, the tactics employed during the attack can be incredibly potent as an attri­\nbution mechanism—if an attack is far removed from a nation’s capabilities, it is less likely that they were involved in the\nincident. Likewise, if the tactics are within a given nation’s technical prowess and follow established patterns exhibited by\nthat nation, it significantly improves the confidence in attribution. However, caution was taken when attributing tactics to\n\nt d ti i l t i b f t t i Th f t ti l i il iti di i il i\n\n\n-----\n\nBiases\n\nThe nature of OSINT gathering poses obstacles to objective analysis. While gathering the data, it should be\nnoted that there are source biases. All of the sources used are open source, and as such the provenance of the informa­\ntion cannot always be independently verified. The information itself may be legitimate, but presented in an incomplete\nor skewed manner. It is also likely that not all of the details of the collected incidents are available. In some cases the\ncompanies reporting the incidents, such as Symantec and MacAfee, are not legally disposed to divulge select information\nabout their customers. Another limitation is information available about incidents that occurred in foreign countries.\nDue to tighter control over journalism or language barriers, other countries are likely not releasing full details from inci­\ndents that have occurred or not doing so in languages familiar to the authors. In some cases, entire events may not be\nreleased to the public, either by foreign governments or the companies themselves.\n\nIn order to address the above concerns, several methods were used. Data was gathered from established, and\nideally trustworthy, sources. This includes reports from reputable news sites, company or government publications, or\nscholarly papers. Also, every effort was made to track down the original source of the information found in reports, or\ncross-examine it with other sources. Multiple sources were found wherever possible and scrutinized in order to obtain\ncorroborating data. Of equal interest is information which was contradictory between sources. These contradictions\nwere presented and addressed where appropriate.\n\nFinally, despite evidence found in support of any given actor, alternate hypotheses must be considered. As with\nany intelligence gathering, there is the possibility of error, whether information is misreported or taken out of context,\nand this is especially true of OSINT. The purpose was not to select an outcome and attempt to support it but rather to\nfind refutation as well. Information that may exculpate a particular actor was thoroughly considered. Although human\nerror is common in cyber incidents, it is important to determine whether the error was taken advantage of by others.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Cyber Espionage\n\nOne of the most easily distinguishable patterns on the above timeline is the growing frequency of reported cyber\nespionage. This saga of long-term campaigns has been garnering a lot of attention, and with good reason. Some have\nasserted that certain campaigns have existed since the early 2000’s[1], yet their existence has only recently come to light in\nthe private sector. The damage caused by these types of breaches is difficult to estimate because it occurred over such a\nlong time span, but in some cases terabytes of data were stolen over the period of a few months.[2] When taken in relation\nto the oil industry, where proprietary information like bid exploration data is the lifeblood of the organization, this can be\na disastrous blow. However, while campaigns like “Night Dragon” are pointedly targeted at the oil industry, others are far\nmore encompassing in their breadth and appear more disparate.\n\nEstablishing a baseline or pattern within this industry alone excludes a large and potentially useful amount of\ncontext. Not only were most of these cyber espionage campaigns larger in scope than simply the oil and gas industry,\nbut some also completely excluded it. Interestingly, there are other cyber espionage campaigns not listed in the timeline\n(such as the infamous Flame and Mahdi viruses) that target countries with some of the largest oil reserves in the world,\nbut the attacks themselves were not targeted at the Oil & Gas Industries.\n\nGiven the sheer number of incidents, it would seem likely that there is more than one source, yet the technical\ndata available seems to suggest otherwise. It is clear that these incidents represent a huge danger to the profitability and\ncompetitiveness, even the future success, of victim companies; Yet these consequences carry with them some level of\ninherent attribution. The very nature of proprietary information means that if an entity who had acquired it were to use\nthe information, it could identify them as having a connection to the incident, whether directly or through a third party.\nAlso, attacks of this scale require some level of organization that manifests itself in the form of repeated patterns of be­\nhavior and resource usage that can suggest a common origin. This organization coupled with the resources and expertise\nnecessary to process and analyze the exorbitant volume of stolen information leads to a high likelihood of state actor or\norganized criminal involvement.\n\nOne of the largest difficulties present in identifying the provenance and totality of these attacks is that there is\nno publicly available aggregation of the body of information collected on the various APT activities. Instead, Antivirus\n& Incident Response firms which have the best vantage point on the situation are providing separate reports in which\nthey use their own colloquial names and terms for the attacks, the tools, and the campaigns. This creates overlap, where\ncampaigns with different names may in fact be part of the same campaign, and the technical data that is otherwise\nseparated across the reports could together represent a more apparent pattern. Only one report, the Mandiant APT1\nreport, included a brief table noting that they had compared some of the other attacks and ruled out APT1 as the culprit.\nAdditionally, these firms are entrusted with the safeguard of their customers’ information, and so often will not release\nthe full extent of what was found, nor a definitive list of victims – adding to the obscurity. These sources also introduce\ntheir own biases which must be accounted for.\n\nFor this reason, what follows is an overview of the various reports that mention the oil and gas industry as\ntargets, and an analysis of important technical aspects and goals of these campaigns. Through this analysis, hopefully\na more complete view of the action may be obtained to see if the goals, resources, techniques, and timeframes exhibit\ncommonality between attacks.\n\n###### 1  Mandiant, APT1 (Feb 13, 2013).

This campaign is unique to some degree in that it used a high\n\nber 2009\n\nnumber of zero day exploits in Adobe Flash and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. While it appears\nthat the attackers used spear-phishing (via email), their primary technique was the use of a\n“watering-hole” attack whereby they attack websites known to be frequented by the target\nusing techniques such as SQL injection, and upload malicious files to these website. The target\nthen visits the site and gets infected. This is interesting because the target does not have any\nindication that it has been compromised, but the number of overall infections goes up because\nof untargeted victims which also visit the site. This attack requires the attackers to find security\nvulnerability in the desired website after selection, requiring more technical skill than some of\nthe other campaigns initially exhibit.

A salient point is that Red October made\nuse of exploit code that was “created by other attackers and employed during different cyber\nattacks. The attackers left the imported exploit code untouched, perhaps to harden the identi­\nfication process.” Additionally, Red October is somewhat unique amongst attacks that targeted\noil and gas in that it is capable of stealing information from a variety of embedded devices\nsuch as phone and routers.\n\n\n**Purpose: “gather intelligence from the compromised organizations”**\n\n**Entry Method: Social Engineering, Spear Phishing, SQL-injection of web servers**\n\n**Countries with Companies Affected: Azerbaijan, Belarus, Turkmenistan, UAE**\n\n\n**Campaign: APT1** **Publisher: Mandiant**\n**Synopsis: The APT1 Report is perhaps the most detailed report to date.

As was already ad­\ndressed, these attacks have been selected for one common thread they share – targets within the oil and gas industry.\nOther between them will now be scrutinized to find any additional links. This is not intended to suggest that the same\ngroup is behind every attack, but rather identify tactical and operational similarities that would point to a unified source\nof training or control.\n\nOne of the most obvious similarities between all of the attacks is the motive: the large scale theft of corporate\ndata. The methodology of data extraction is very similar between Night Dragon, Shady RAT, Elderwood, APT1, and Byz­\nantine Candor. One note on this is that although the attacks all followed a similar methodology, this very methodology is\ncommon in the network penetration t world, and so not entirely unique. Slides from a presentation given by SANS affili­\nate James Shewmaker in 2008 highlight this methodology in brief: Reconnaissance, Port/Vulnerability Scan, Exploitation,\nand Repeat from the new vantage point. The only thing largely different is that the data exfiltration occurs after exploita­iti\n\n\n-----\n\nto be discounted. Additionally, these attacks all appear to be operating out of either Beijing, Shanghai, and Shandong\nprovince.\n\nThe data below will show that Byzantine Candor and APT1 are one in the same – they share operators (Ugly\nGorilla) and unique technical infrastructure like Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs). Mandiant tied APT1 back to the\nPLA, and a . Mandiant even acknowledges the article written by Bloomberg in their report, and identifies the “Comment\nGroup” as an alias\n\n###### IP Addresses & Origins\n\nWhile about half of the reports omitted IP ranges, the majority of IP address ranges mentioned came from\nservice provided by China Unicom to one of two locales: Beijing or Shanghai. The major exception to this is Red October,\nwhich largely had IP address ranges coming from Germany and Russia. Excluding Red October, in cases where ranges\ndid not come from Beijing or Shanghai, they were often identified as host that were compromised and used as proxies\nloaded with tools such as HTRAN.\n\nNight Dragon Elderwood Mirage Red October APT1\n\n[unspecified IP 114.240.0.0/20 141.101.239.225 223.166.0.0/15\nrange – most\n\n178.63.208.49 58.246.0.0/15\n\nC2 servers\n\n112.64.0.0/15\n\noperating out\nof Heze City, 139.226.0.0/15\nChina]\n\n114.80.0.0/20\n\n101.80.0.0/20\n\nInterestingly Night Dragon, which does not provide a range of IP addresses, offered instead that an individual operating\nout of Heze City, Shandong, China was responsible for providing the C2 servers through his company. An article published\nin the Wall Street Journal notes that McAfee identified this individual as “Song Zhiyue.”[3]\n\n###### Domains\n\nA full list of domains retrieved from the various reports can be found in the appendices. Of the domains which\nappeared in the reports, only matches between APT1 and Byzantine Candor were identified. The rest were inconclusive\nas some of the reports did not include FQDNs and others which did include them did not provide a full list. Additionally, a\nlarge portion of the attacks made use of Dynamic DNS services, where the parent domain is not inherently malicious. But\nsubdomains may be used by service subscribers for their own purposes without policing.\n\n**Registered domains common be­**\n\n**tween APT1 & Byzantine Candor**\n*.hugesoft.org\nwww.arrowservice.net\nwww.blackcake.net\nwww.dnsweb.org\nwww.globalowa.com\nwww.purpledailt.com\nwww.worthhummer.net\nwww1.earthsolution.org\n\n###### 3  Hodge, N. & Entous, A.

Dell Secure­\nworks which authored the Mirage Report also authored a piece known as the Sin Digoo Affair.[5] The connecting factor\nbetween the Sin Digoo affair and Mirage was that an operator reused several email addresses (jeno_1980@hotmail.com\n& king_public@hotmail.com) and infrastructure between them. The C2 servers used a Dynamic DNS service operated by\n3322.org. The Sin Digoo Affair also ties these back to Gh0stNet via 3322.org and the RSA breach based on the reuse of\nIP address blocks belonging to the “China Beijing Province Network (AS4808).” Peng Yong also owns other domains tied\nback to malicious use both in Aurora and elsewhere. According to Steve Ragan of the Tech Herald, Peng Yong is possibly\nthe author of the CRC function used in some of the Aurora malware.[6]\n\nIt is entirely possible that 3322.org was providing services to multiple separate APT groups, it is after all a fairly\nsuccessfully Dynamic DNS service which has been documented in other malware cases. However, Peng’s level of in­\nvolvement in the Aurora campaign should be scrutinized. Interestingly the Sin Digoo report also attempts to identify the\njeno_1980 account which had the alias “Tawnya Grilith” attached to it. In the process of their investigation, they tied\nback the account to an operator going by the screen name “xxgchappy.” They also found a piece of malware ostensibly\nwritten by xxgc happy appearing to date back to March of 2002. This is potentially significant because it is the time frame\naround which the leaked US embassy cable had noted possible PLA cyber espionage activity. Malware used by this actor,\nas well as appearing in Mirage and Gh0stNet, was discovered in 2011 and 2012 to have infected government ministries in\nVietnam, Brunei, and Myanmar. Additionally there are a few infected victims in Europe and the Middle East belonging to\n“government ministries in different countries, an embassy, a nuclear safety agency, and other business-related groups.”[7]\nThis is of interest in part because Red October also targeted government ministries and embassies.\n\nHowever, in order to more fully analyze any connections between the domains that were listed in each of the\nreports, the whois and ARIN records could be examined. The contact information could then be cross-referenced to find\nsimilarities. Unfortunately, many of the domains had their contact information scrubbed or have since changed hands in\nthe wake of the reports being released, so an analysis at this point would be erroneous and incomplete at best.\n\nA final note on domains is that many of the reports did look for registrant information – in the case of APT1 for\ninstance, many registrants blatantly put China as their place of origin, or poorly masked this fact by misspelling the places\nthey chose or including a Shanghai phone number. In the case of Red October however, all registrations with the excep­\ntion of one were done with “.ru” email addresses, and addresses were not reused as had been the case in other instanc­\nes. This signals a much more concerted effort to remain anonymous, and a level of professionalism not seen in the other\nattacks.\n\n###### 4  HB Gary. (Feb 10, 2010). Operation Aurora.

Below are several incidents that demonstrate strong correlation to the information discussed_\n_above._\n\nNorway, November 2011\n\nNorway had the most prolific series of cyber-attacks in the country’s history in November 2011.[8] As reported\nby Norway’s National Security Agency (NSM), more than 10 firms were targeted by an advanced persistent threat using\nspear-fishing attacks, many of which were in the oil industry.[9] The attacks may have been ongoing for over a year. The\ncompanies were unaware of the attacks until concerned employees reported receiving suspicious emails.\n\nNo specific information was released on the tools or malware that were used to conduct these attacks; however\nNSM noted that a virus was used in conjunction with tailored spear-fishing attacks making use of trojan attachments.[10]\nIt appeared that the purpose of the attacks was large-scale data exfiltration. As was the case in Night Dragon, the NSM\nbulletin suggests that the attacks varied slightly each time so as to avoid AV detection. An article by Defense News quotes\nNSM as stating that “the attacks have, on several occasions, come when the companies have been involved in large-scale\ncontract negotiations.”[11] This could suggest that the attackers were privy to the negotiations. Interestingly, in 2010 Nor­\nway’s Statoil was engaged in negotiations with China Oilfield Services, Ltd. (COSL). According to the Wall Street Journal,\nCOSL is the “oil-field services and rig-construction unit of state-controlled China National Offshore Oil Corp., the country’s\n\n###### 8  BBC News.

Defense News. Retrieved from http://www.defensenews.com/article/20111118/DEFSECT04/111180309/Norwegian-Defense\n\n-----\n\nThe goal of the attacks appeared to be the collection of confidential information, such as user names, passwords,\nindustrial drawings, and other proprietary documents.[13] This would seem to be consistent with the types of informa­\ntion sought in both Night Dragon and APT1. The timeframe of the attack aligns with the event timeline listed in the APT1\nreport, and within the report there is an event appearing in Norway. This is then a convergence of time and objectives\nacross these operations which complement the tactical similarities involving the use of social engineering, persistent\nbackdoors, and large scale data exfiltration.\n\nTelvent, September 2012\n\nIn September 2012 Canadian energy company Telvent was infiltrated. Telvent is responsible for supplying control\nprograms and systems for over half of the oil and gas pipelines in North and Latin America.[14] The attackers installed mal­\nware which they used to steal project files related to Telvent’s OASyS SCADA product. According to security blogger Brian\nKrebbs, OASyS is “a product that helps energy firms mesh older IT assets with more advanced ‘smart grid’ technologies.”\n\n15\n\nThe infiltration follows the same methodical approach exhibited in the Night Dragon and Norwegian intrusions.\nNot only was the malware difficult to detect, but it was planted using spear-phishing methods that targeted mid to high\nlevel executives[16] [17].\n\nPerhaps the most convincing piece of evidence as to the origins of the attack is what appears to be a notifica­\ntion released by Telvent which identified malicious files and domains used for Command and Control (C2). The filenames\n“fxsst.dll” and “ntshrui.dll” which appear in the Telvent notification also appear in the APT1 report, along with the\ndomains “hugesoft.org” and “bigish.net” which are noted as mainstays of APT1 by Mandiant. Several security firms at\nthe time also reported the belief that the attack had been perpetrated by the “comment group” an alias in the Mandiant\nReport for APT1. In fact, Mandiant actually mentioned the Telvent attack in their report under a section entitled “APT1 in\nthe News.”\n\nThe reason the Telvent attack is so important is that it represents the possibility for departure from simply data\nexfiltration. Although available information indicates that the goal of the attack was stealing software, the software could\njust have easily been modified and replaced. Attacking a prolific energy ICS company like Telvent means that a trojan\ncould be planted in the software, being unintentionally distributed to Telvent’s customers and offering the perpetrator an\navenue for more insidious attacks.\n\n###### 12  Simon Hall (2013, December 13).

Night Dragon highlights the use of a\nRAT known as zwSheel which was used both as a to perform C2 and to create custom trojans. Interestingly, upon launch\nzwShell displays an error dialog with a hidden text field and the program will not function unless the password ‘zw.china’\nis entered into this hidden text field. The ranges of consecutive IP addresses used were large enough that it is likely that\nthe Chinese government had to be involved in some capacity.\n\nChina certainly possesses the motive to commit the attacks – according to the Washington Times, China is\nalready surpassing the United States as the number one oil importer from the Middle East[18], and poised to become the\nnumber one oil importer globally.\n\nIncreasing Demand\n\nChinese demand for oil has grown dramatically as its economy continues to expand. Since the mid-1990s, China\nhas been a net importer of oil.[19] The continuous growth of the Chinese economy has resulted in vast increases in the\nneed for fuel and petro products. China has doubled its oil consumption in the last 10 years and become the second\nlargest consumer of oil in the world behind the U.S.[20] Like the U.S., China is now dependent on its oil imports to feed its\nthriving economy. It is estimated that China’s import dependency could rise to over 50% by 2020.[1]\n\nChina’s oil refineries are not capable of handling the current demand the economy is placing on them. There is\nevidence that the refineries used for fuel are at a competitive disadvantage when compared to other countries. To com­\nplicate matters, many Chinese oil refineries are also oriented to the making of diesel and not gasoline, which is in increas­\ning demand[1].\n\nThis means China is in great need of more sources of oil and more efficient refineries. The development of im­\nproved refining and mining equipment takes years and can cost millions of dollars. Exploration costs for finding new oil\nreserves have almost tripled in the past decade.[21] They could save billions of dollars and shave years of research off by\nacquiring technology from petrochemical corporations that are already heavily invested in this continuing process. It also\nmeans that China would be able to compete in the global market place much sooner and more competitively than if they\nwaited to develop the technology on their own. This establishes that there are significant reasons for China to act on\nbehalf of its own oil industry and use its state resources to conduct cyber-attacks against corporate entities worldwide.\n\n###### 18  Hill, P.

This spike in\nproduction could be due to information that China gained from US firms through cyber espionage actions, such as Night\nDragon. The Night Dragon attacks were believed to have begun circa 2007. According to Kirk, information taken during\nthese attacks includes market intelligence reports and information on operational production systems.[23] Similarly, the\nMandiant report shows that the APT1 group has monitored Mandiant’s energy industry customers from approximately\nthe beginning of 2009 to 2012.[24] During these attacks, APT1 would export terabytes of data from the victims to China.\nIn tandem with these revelations, China’s also aggressively pursued oil supply contracts during 2009.[25] During this time\nmajor Chinese state oil companies acquired holdings in 18 different countries. China is determined to take on oil and gas\ninfrastructure development and to acquire oil industry assets.[26]\n\nAlthough there is evidence that China has been conducting cyber espionage activities against oil industry targets\nas far back as 2007, there is only trivial growth until 2009. This could be a result of the time and recourse commitment\nrequired to process the data that was acquired. As mentioned, both the Night Dragon and APT1 attacks stole an enor­\nmous amount of data from English speaking companies. It is necessary for English-fluent operators to sift through this\ndata and extract actionable information to report. This information would also need to be provided to experts in the\nfield who could recognize the its vale, and that process would have to be done discreetly so as not to arouse suspicions.\nThis would take time. The Mandiant report comments on the fact that there are limited English-fluent operators directly\ninvolved in the technical end of APT1, which would significantly hinder progress.[27]  Considering these factors and the\ntimeframe for growth presented above, it is conceivable that the information and strategy for its use would not be avail­\nable until 2009. At this point, China could act to increase the output of the holdings that they currently owned. Also, the\ninformation gained from market intelligence reports and possibly exploration reports could guide the state companies\nin deciding which new holdings to purchase during this time period. The new holdings would allow for increased output\noverall.\n\nChina’s Investments\n\nChina’s fervor for oil acquisition has not been limited to aggressive increases in holdings and contracts. These ac­\ntivities are likely only one piece of a global strategy to secure China’s future oil requirements, including reserves that may\nnot be productive today or in the immediate future. This overarching strategy has apparently led to a pattern of quiet\ninvestment, which may be a direct cause for concern in America. An article appearing in the Associated Press discusses\nthese Chinese investments in Venezuela, the country with the largest proven oil reserves as of 2011, and throughout the\nCaribbean and South America. The article notes that “when Venezuela seized billions of dollars in assets from Exxon Mo­\n\n###### 22  U.S. Energy Information Administration. (2013, February 12).

In some cases it appears that the Chinese are making loans that the countries will likely be\nincapable of repaying, placing them squarely within China’s control. Many of the deals included “repayment in oil and\nnatural gas” and billions of dollars have been loaned directly to energy companies in Russia and Turkmenistan, both of\nwhich have been targeted in cyber espionage campaigns and are in the top 5 for proven natural gas reserves.\n\nAlthough the IEA has predicted that America is moving towards energy independence and is poised to become\nthe number one oil exporter by 2017, the loans are breeding closeness with and reliance on China by countries in close\nproximity to the US. This could allow for the Chinese to weaken American influence in the region and create agitation\nagainst the US or between other countries within the region in order to distract the US from its goals in other areas stra­\ntegic to the Chinese. These deals also place China in the supply chain for borrowers’ projects where China has insisted\non Chinese companies being involved as a stipulation of the loan. These loans have not required any economic reforms\nto accompany them, meaning that countries which could not secure a loan from the IMF due to poor financial decisions\nmay continue to flounder in spite of aid, perhaps even more so because of it. In the worst case scenario, these countries\nbecome unstable. While this may cause issues to the Chinese in some logistical capacities, it would also serve to divert\nsome of America’s attention, making the situation a palatable outcome for China.\n\n###### Other actors\n\nAn analysis of these events would be remiss without exploring any other possible attribution. Though unlikely,\nit is possible that there were other actors involved. As pointed out by Eugene Kaspersky in his criticism of the Shady RAT\nreport, some of the tools and techniques are generic enough to not lend themselves to attribution to a particular entity.\nEven the ones that are of Chinese origin do not of themselves implicate the Chinese government, only an actor familiar\nwith how the tool works or minimally trained in Mandarin. A large portion of these tools were freely available on under­\nground Chinese hacking sites. Chinese hacking collectives or corporations may have been independently involved. How­\never, due to the suspicions voiced in the leaked diplomatic cables suggesting PLA involvement[28] and Mandiant’s research\non the topic indicating the same[29], it is highly unlikely that the Chinese government was not involved whatsoever. These\nsources, and the timeframe in which the attacks occurred -- between roughly 9am and 5pm consistently over a protract­\ned period of time[3031] -- is indicative of a formalization of the activity. This is further evidenced by the resources required\nto carry out the attack and the Chinese government’s grasps on censorship of their citizens through technical controls.\nTerabytes of data infiltrating the country is unlikely to have been missed, particularly over the course of a decade of\nactivity.\n\nIf China had been involved in any capacity in cyber espionage attacks and this had been discovered by another\nentity, said entity might have leveraged this knowledge to collude with them either through coercion, cooperation,\nor clandestinely without the Chinese government knowing. Though this may seem farfetched, a report released by a\nLuxemburg security firm details how, in the wake of Mandiant’s APT1 report, they decided to engage in an intelligence\ngathering operation on the APT groups operating out of China. By scanning Chinese IP ranges for C2 servers known to be\nused in the APT1 attacks and exploiting weaknesses in the attackers’ C2 infrastructure, they were able to access, monitor,\nand control the APT infrastructure without the adversary’s knowledge. Bloomberg also hinted at the possibility of Ameri­\ncan security firms acting in a similar way when they “exploit[ed] a hole in the hackers’ security … logging the intruders’\nevery move as they crept into networks...” Knowing that the Chinese were actively engaged in such operations and likely\nturning a blind eye to any infiltration of data, another actor operating through China and attempting to incriminate China\ncould have engaged in cyber espionage as well. This is truly a stretch of the imagination, and there is no evidence what­\nsoever to support this theory. The most likely case for any attribution involves the Chinese government in some capacity.\n\n###### 28  Glanz, J. & Markoff, J. (Dec 4 2010). Vast Hacking by a China Fearful of the Web.

Inexorably, Oil and Gas is intertwined with the Cyber domain, and will only continue to become more so as the\ntime progresses. The increased reliance on technology means that more and more data and control will be accessible to\nthe attackers in the future. A large contingent of the attacks relied on social engineering and spear phishing as a point\nof entry, though there is a shift toward “watering hole” attacks. This is significant because even as technical controls get\nbetter, unwitting employees and their behavior will continue to be a focal point in targeted attacks.\n\nAutomation via SCADA/ICS has been an integral part of the Oil industry’s past and will be even more so in the fu­\nture. Attacks like the Telvent attack herald an insidious turn of events for SCADA within Oil & Gas. The attackers seemed\nintent on stealing SCADA software, but it is conceivable that they could have taken such an opportunity to embed their\nown code within it, providing a capability to manipulate large swaths of North American pipeline at will. This is not\nmeant to be alarmist, but rather considers the next evolution of attack. Leveraging malicious SCADA software to achieve\na kinetic outcome is not the baseline going forward, but it is well within the realm of possibility. The nature of a capabil­\nity like this means that it can only be leveraged to catastrophic effect once, so the possibility of an entity using it outside\nof sustained or ardent conflict is low. However using this on a micro-scale, and degrading service or quality of service\nthrough manipulation of malicious software on the PLCs or HMIs could be more viable in a peacetime setting, and less\nnoticeable. This type of activity could be used at the height of negotiations or disputes to put an adversary in a compro­\nmising position, or simply distract them.\n\nThe Cyber-warfare doctrine of large nation-states like China and Russia that have a huge stake in the Oil &\nGas Industries is one of perpetual conflict. Timothy Thomas discusses this in his books Recasting the Red Star and The\nDragon’s Quantum Leap. The idea of an “active defense” and keeping potential competitors “off balance” is the posture\ngoing forward. The concept of peace being a time without conflict is rapidly disappearing. As globalization has become\nthe status quo and global economies become ever more entangled, threat of a large-scale kinetic confrontation between\ntop tier economic powerhouses is nearly strategically unviable. Instead, both state and non-state actors will use constant\nconflict in the Cyber realm as a method for accruing resources and exercising control. While cyber conflict often brings\nto mind the idea of SCADA initiated pipeline explosions, the theft of intellectual property and business communications\nis far more likely to continue. This type of low intensity conflict is cost-effective and politically sustainable in an environ­\nment where direct attribution is at times difficult. The idea of a constant or long term “ally” or “strategic partner” is no\nlonger valid – coordination will be largely issue specific, and only to the extent required to achieve an end. While coor­\ndinating on one topic nations will be in conflict on another. This is not in any way a revolutionary or new idea; however\nit is becoming more and more relevant to salient industries operating within their own nation state and abroad as they\nbecome far more accessible and targetable in this type of conflict.\n\nNon-state actors will play a huge role in future cyber conflict within the oil and gas industry. The Norway attack\nwhich coincided with a meeting by a state-backed Oil & Gas company may suggest that they already are playing a role.\nCertainly Antivirus & Incident Response companies are playing a role as non-state actors by releasing these reports. But\naside from cooperation with Sate actors, non-state actors may operate independently against other non-state actors in\npursuit of competitive advantage or sabotage. Hacker collectives like anonymous could have an out-sized impact if more\nhighly organized, and the attacks they have already carried out could become more severe – instead of simply releasing\nemail addresses, they could release bid data, or attempt something more destructive akin to a Shamoon type attack.\n\nThe release of reports on APT is in a way its own form of cyber conflict; the rhetoric of these reports is an infor­\nmation influence operation, both targeted at potential customers and at adversaries. These reports also allow adversar­\nies to see how they were detected and correct mistakes going forward. It is likely that future attacks will lack the types of\nunprofessional mistakes made during these campaigns. The embedding of personal signatures (a la Ugly Gorilla) or the\nuse of passwords like “zw.china” will diminish significantly. If an attacker wished to be more anonymous, it would start\nto transition to open-source and generic tools exclusively – tools which are common enough that they do not provide\n\ni ifi t tt ib ti T l lik th M t l it f k id hi h d f t ibilit ith t ff i\n\n\n-----\n\nattackers or written in other languages would complicate attribution. The move within the Information Technology world\ntoward more forensically resistant technologies such as SSDs and Cloud Service infrastructures which make attribution\nand legal jurisdiction much more convoluted will continue to be a catalyst for future attacks alongside services already in\nuse like Dynamic DNS.\n\nThese cyber espionage attacks are likely the newly established baseline for future cyber conflict within the Oil &\nGas Industry. Attacks of this nature and magnitude will continue to originate from places which do not have laws against\nit or are complicit, including China which has a need to secure oil dominance in the future. However, increasing interna­\ntional pressure will necessitate more covert action, with attackers dispersing their operators or proxies throughout large\ngeographic areas. Non-state actors will likely present APT threats in the future, including State-backed and independent\ncompetitors.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Sabotage\n\n#### Middle East, 2012\n\nAnother series of events may be connected as well, and while they bear no immediately apparent relationship,\ncloser inspection is suggestive of the possibility of another underlying and ongoing conflict. To understand the context of\nthe exchange, a non-oil-related cyber event must be briefly discussed. A relatively unprecedented cyber-attack came to\nlight in 2010 when the Stuxnet virus hit the uranium enrichment centrifuges in Iran. Iran believes the attack was con­\nducted by Israel or the United States. This attack had targeted the information networks of offshore platforms; however\nthey reported that they were able to defend against the attack.[32] Iran may have thought it was Israel because they had\nthreatened to take military action if the sanctions on Tehran’s banking and oil sectors did not stop Iran from continu­\ning their nuclear program. The attacks targeted Iran’s infrastructure and communications companies, which slowed the\nInternet in Iran. Israel and the United States have denied being a part of this attack.\n\nThen In April of 2012, Iran was again the target of a cyber-attack. The Islamic republic reported that a computer\nvirus was detected inside the control systems of Kharg Island, which controls Iran’s crude oil exports.[33] This virus began to\nattack several of the main Persian Gulf oil terminals in Iran, which forced the Iranian officials to disconnect them from the\nInternet to avoid spreading the virus.[34] This virus, known as Wiper, successfully erased information from hard disks at the\nOil Ministry’s headquarters in Tehran.[35] The headquarters had apparently been the initial target of the virus. Oil Ministry\nofficials reported that the international selling division had not been infected, but it many security vulnerabilities were\nexposed. Iran is one of the world’s largest oil producers and an attack could affect the market, and raise oil prices global­\nly.[36]\n\nAs with the Stuxnet worm, Iran blamed Israel and the United States for the spread of Wiper. Iranian officials be­\nlieve they were targeted because of their growing nuclear program.[37] Other affected organizations include the National\nIranian Oil Processing and Distribution Company, National Iranian Gas Company, Iranian Offshore Oil Company, Pars Oil\nand Gas, and other companies controlled by the National Iranian Oil Company.[38] The destruction of this data doesn’t\nprovide much in the way of direct monetary gain for any criminal elements. The real advantage gained by unleashing\nWiper is to put pressure on Iran by causing economic loss and reminding them that they are vulnerable. The president\nof the Tehran World Trade Center, Mohammad Reza Sabzalipour, believes the cyber-attack was indeed a direct message.\nThe aim was to increase pressure so that Iran will compromise in the upcoming nuclear talks on May 23, 2012. He later\nstates, “We are in a bloodless war. If the talks fail, Iran can expect much more of this[39]”.\n\n###### 32  Erdbrink, T., (2012, April 23).

In March of 2012, the Obama administration an­\nnounced that the market could withstand the embargo of Iranian oil, and raised US-Iran tensions over the issue[40]. Saudi\nArabia had also indicated that it would boost oil exports to the US and abroad to compensate for the void that would be\nleft by the sanctions on Iran[41]. As the fifth largest oil producer in the world, the Iranian oil industry accounts for about\n20 percent of Iran’s GDP[42]. Both the embargo and the virus represent serious and direct concerns for the Iranian govern­\nment.\n\nThen in August of 2012, only four months after the embargo, a virus named Shamoon struck Saudi Arabian oil\ngiant Aramco.[43] The virus was triggered on a Muslim holiday when most of the company’s employees were absent from\nwork. Shamoon was designed to replace data on hard drives with a picture of a burning American flag and report the ad­\ndress of the computer back to a separate computer inside the company network.[44] This is potentially significant because\nAramco is the world’s largest producer of oil, and was originally a joint effort with the United States (Arabian American\nOil Company).[45,46] Additionally, Shamoon contained a function called “Wiper” which was responsible for the deleting of\nfiles. The name “Wiper” and the shared functionality of the two are somewhat suggestive. Interestingly, a previously\nunheard of “hacktivist” group identifying themselves as “The Cutting Sword of Justice” took credit for the attack and not\na nation state. They claim the virus has given them access to documents on Aramco’s computers, but none have been\npublished yet.[47] The attack was believed to have been assisted by an insider at the company. Another note of signifi­\ncance about Shamoon is that the text “Arabian Gulf” was found in the code which is pertinent because Iran has zealously\nguarded the title of the region as the “Persian Gulf.[48]”\n\nAlthough Wiper and Shamoon share a few common characteristics, they are significantly different. Both viruses have\nbeen analyzed by Kaspersky Labs who has concluded that although Shamoon contains a wiper function that is designed\nto overwrite data, it is not as well-designed as Wiper and not near as efficient.[49] The care that was taken by whoever\nmade Wiper to insure it did as much damage as possible in the shortest amount of time is what differentiates it from\nShamoon’s wiping feature. Since wiping a disk with hundreds of gigabytes of storage can take an extremely long time,\nWiper was designed to target files with certain extensions or in certain folders to do as much irreparable damage as fast\nas possible. Kaspersky claims that Shamoon was merely a copycat virus that was “the work of script kiddies inspired by\nthe story.”[50] They also claim that Shamoon was probably the work of a non-state group and that Wiper was most likely\n###### 40  Mathews, C., (2012 Mar. 30).

Whether it was the unimpressive work of a nation-state\nor the work of a skilled group of non-state actors, it made an impact and had an effect on Saudi Aramco.\n\nThese insights raise the question of whether or not this was an isolated attack by a non-state actor, or whether it was\none in an ongoing series of salvos between the Iran and US cyber communities. Iran certainly possessed the motive –\nretribution for sanctions levied against it, and the cooperation by Saudi Arabia, a Sunni Muslim nation which has been at\nodds with Shiite Iran before. Typically, however, in an act of retribution the attacker invites attribution which Iran did not.\nAlso, despite causing destructive action to the data on the computers, the virus did not attack the actual control systems\nand as a result did not manage to damage oil production. The relative crudeness of the code and use of the term “Ara­\nbian Gulf” in concert with the insider knowledge of the hacktivist group “The Cutting Sword of Justice” and the use of an\nAramco insider to facilitate the attack could suggest that it was simply a singular attack by a non-state actor.\n\nIran’s doctrine is one of asymmetric and proxy warfare. It has been suggested that Iran used unofficial hacker groups\nsuch as the “Iranian Cyber Army” to both defend against and engage in attacks[52]. It is possible that “Arabian Gulf” was\na red herring intended to further obscure the origin of Shamoon.[53] Using a proxy to launch an attack aligns with Iran’s\nstrategic culture but the exact author is not known. It is possible that Iran did not wish to engage in direct conflict, but\nintended to make the sanctions less viable by ensuring Aramco would be unable to supply the necessary volume of oil. If\nthis were the case then the attack would show a severe flaw in Iran’s understanding of the oil production systems by not\nattacking the control systems, instead, which should be unlikely due to Iran’s own expertise in oil production; or it may\nhave been intended to send a message advertising the capability while not crossing a direct line by inflicting significant\ninfrastructure damage. This, however, is pure speculation and not empirically derived analysis. If Iran did in fact orches­\ntrate the Shamoon attack, it would suggest that the series of attacks on Iranian critical infrastructure were followed by\nretaliation on the American oil supply chain. This would indicate an ongoing and escalating conflict that should be cause\nfor concern.\n\n###### 51  Ibid 52  Rezvaniyeh, F., (2010, Feb. 26) Pulling the strings of the net: Iran’s Cyber Army.

On April 20[th], the culmination of severe neglect of\nsafety protocols and a slew of design and implementation flaws incurred the worst environmental disaster in US his­\ntory. [54] While drilling the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig had a “blowout” in which an\nuncontrolled mixture of mud and gas was released after failure of pressure control systems. The gas spread across the rig\nand is believed to have first ignited in the engine room, initiating several explosions and causing the rig to eventually be\nengulfed in flames and sink.[55] The reason the “Deepwater Horizon” event appears on a list of “cyber-related oil industry\nevents” is because, regardless of the cause, the incident had several failures in networked control and safety systems\nwhich could have prevented the catastrophe from occurring after the blowout.\n\nThe former chief electronics technician on the rig, Michael Williams, noted during testimony before a govern­\nment panel that the alarms which would notify the crew of a gas situation was placed in an “inhibited” mode for over\na year because “they did not want people woke up at 3 o’clock in the morning due to false alarms [sic].”[56] Additionally,\nother monitoring and control systems intermittently froze, and a fire and alarm system was set to “override active.” De­\nspite a series of four tests conducted in the hours before the incident to ascertain that the integrity of the well, no alarms\nwere sounded or reported directly before the incident. These control issues solidify the idea that there was a cybercomponent to the catastrophe. When taken into the context of other events which occur in and around the same time\nperiod, it becomes clear that though there is no direct evidence pointing to a malign threat actor’s involvement, such an\nattack is technically viable.\n\nIt is incredibly unlikely that any state or non-state actor was involved in an attack on the Deepwater Horizon;\nhowever the circumstances preclude the exclusion of this possibility, remote though it may be. The Blowout Preventer\n(BOP) was recovered and forensically examined, but most other evidence cannot be examined – it has either ceased to\nexist or is inaccessible. The destructive nature of the accident and the apparent corporate neglect makes collecting any\ncyber-forensic evidence linking the incident to an actor infeasible. Most evidence is destroyed, unusable, or largely inac­\ncessible at the bottom of the ocean.  It is likely that any control system audit reports or logs capable of providing insight\neither would not have attributed anomalous activity to an unidentified APT, or would not be comprehensive enough to\nprovide evidence that could retroactively suggest an APT. The audit logs themselves are dubious due to allegations that\nTransocean and BP were hastily rushing procedures because of large scheduling overruns.[57] Further allegations have\nsurfaced against BP employees and contractors accusing them of destroying evidence in the wake of the disaster.[58] Bear­\ning in mind that there is no direct or forensically sound evidence and that only circumstantial evidence is available, the\nvignette which will now be explored is the use case of the Deepwater Horizon incident as a cyber-attack.\n\nSeveral events that have occurred both before and since the BP oil spill suggest that an attack would be techni­\ncally feasible. According to an article attributed to Dorothy E. Denning, a professor of computer science at Georgetown\nUniversity, in 1992 a disgruntled former employee of Chevron intentionally disabled alarm systems at Chevron’s oil refin­\neries for 10 hours by “hacking into computers in New York and San José, California.”[59] While this only affected on-shore\nrefineries and is dated enough that technical controls may have improved since then, another attack in 2009 showed that\ncontrol systems on off-shore rigs may be also disabled remotely. Mario Azar, a disgruntled contractor formerly working\nfor Pacific Energy Resources, sabotaged an offshore oil rig “computer system that PER used to communicate between its\n\n###### 54 (David Barstow, 2010) 55 (How the Rig Crew Responded to the Blowout, 2010) 56 (Investigation of Deepwarer Horizon Explosion, Mike Williams, 2010) 57 (Drilling, 2011) 58 (Affairs, 2012)\n\n\n-----\n\ndisabled from May 8[th] until June 29[th] before it was noticed.[61] And as recently as February 23[rd] 2013 an article in the\nHuston Chronicle stated that “Malicious software unintentionally downloaded by offshore oil workers has incapacitated\ncomputer networks on some rigs and platforms, exposing gaps in security that could pose serious risks to people and the\nenvironment.”[62]\n\nThese articles would seem to state that a cyber-attack on an off-shore rig is not only possible, but a reality.\nComplicated control system attacks such as Stuxnet have already proven that even in conditions where network access\nis unavailable, intelligent viruses can still perform a predetermined function at a designated time. By extension of these\noccurances, it may be concluded that a capable attacker could manipulate safety control systems of an oil rig from shore,\nand do so through a sophisticated control system virus which can operate even when not in contact with a C2 server.\n\nIf it is assumed that Deepwater Horizon was an attack, it gives rise to the question of attribution. In order to\nattribute an attack for which there is no direct or forensic evidence, one must instead turn to political attribution. This\nincludes considering which actors had the motive, means, and the opportunity to perform the attack. Motives can in\npart be divined through observation of the direct and indirect outcomes of the event and its beneficiaries. After narrow­\ning the scope of actors, one may then examine the policies, strategic culture, operations, and tactics of relevant actors\nagainst different dimensions of the event to reveal alignment or correlation.\n\nImmediate and direct impacts of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill were as follows:\n\n    - A moratorium on any drilling in the Gulf of Mexico for the ensuing 6 months\n\n    - The Macondo well becoming unusable, at least in the immediate\n\n    - Ecological disaster in the United States and other GoM adjacent countries\n\n    - Heavy political damage, fines, and charges levied against both BP and contractors such as Transocean,\n\nLtd.\n\nBP has been by far the biggest figure attached to the incident. As of March 2013 BP has been forced to spend or\nprovision $40 Billion as a result of Deepwater Horizon.[63] To put this in perspective, BP’s combined profits for the years of\n2010-2012 amount to about $34.6 billion.[64]\n\nThese impacts in and of themselves are notable, but they also created a ripple effect of indirect consequences as\nwell. These indirect outcomes include the possible fluctuation in oil and gas prices and potential for geopolitical fallout\nfrom the ecological disaster. Additionally though, and perhaps most significantly, in 2011 BP announced a $38 billion\nasset divestment program in order to cover the costs of the enormous fines incurred by the Deepwater Horizon spill.[65] So\nwhat did BP divest, and to whom?\n\n###### 60 (Mrozek, 2009) 61 (United States of America v. Mario Azar, 2009) 62 (Shauk, 2013) 63 (Williams, 2013) 64 (BP, 2012, p. 34)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis data would suggest that one of the main beneficiaries of the oil spill is Rosneft, a state-owned oil company\nbelonging to a state actor which possesses both a cyber-capability and vested interest in the oil industry. It is the only\none of the top five oil producing countries yet to be mentioned: the Russian Federation. In July of 2012 Forbes released\nan article on the World’s largest oil companies. What was notable about the article was this quote: “But when sorting\nthrough the rankings of the World’s 25 Biggest Oil Companies and looking at who controls and influences the biggest of\nbig oil one thing becomes clear: no industry leader has more sway, has twisted more arms or made more deals than Rus­\nsian President Vladimir Putin.” The article goes on to point out the Russian President’s past use of Gazprom—the staterun oil giant and second largest producer in the world—as a political tool and his vast influence over other non-Russian\noil companies. Russia, an acknowledged force in cyber and the second largest exporter of oil in the world, is markedly\nabsent in the last decade from the master timeline either as an aggressor or as a target, barring of a few leaked emails\nby the Anonymous hacking group. This appears aberrant, even despite the possible language barrier mentioned at the\nbeginning of this report or Russia’s tightly controlled dissemination of information.\n\nWhile clearly the Russian Federation was the largest beneficiary of BP’s post-spill divestments and also benefited\nfrom a halt in Gulf of Mexico oil production, the question that remains is whether or not the possible acquisition of TNKBP (which would be difficult to predict) is motivation enough to engage in a risky enterprise such as a cyber-attack that\nresults in a kinetic outcome—particularly when weighed against the possibility of direct attribution that could have far\nreaching implications to relations with both the UK and the US. If these benefits alone are not enough, then what other\nmotivators existed which, in concert, would have been cause for Russia to launch a cyber-attack on a UK company oper­\nating in the Gulf of Mexico? In order to properly answer these questions many factors need to be examined, including:\n\n    - the extent of BP-Russian relations leading up to and beyond the Deepwater Horizon incident\n\n    - Geopolitical considerations of the time\n\n    - Any competition in market-share between BP and Russian state-controlled oil companies\n\n    - Russia’s overall relation to and dependence on the oil industry\n\n    - Russia’s strategic goals at the time\n\n\n-----\n\nexchanges that highlight a tenuous co-existence. The figure below displays this in detail, aligned with geopolitical events.\nThe exchange begins in 2006 when the Russian state-run gas company Rosneft went public on the London stock ex­\nchange and BP purchased 1 billion in shares. This is a seemingly straightforward strategic partnering; however there\nwas speculation that BP was “pressured into investing in order to secure future oil exploration rights for its own Rus­\nsian joint TNK-BP.”[66] Robert Amsterdam, a layer for the former head of Yukos (an oil company absorbed by Rosneft),\nwas quoted as saying that BP “has a gun held to its head.”[67] Then in June 2007, The Russian government pressures BP\nto sell one of the world’s largest natural gas fields to state-run Gazprom or lose the license to develop it.[68] 2008 pre­\nsented perhaps the height of tensions when armed police raided BP-TNK’s Moscow offices[69] in what appeared to be an\neffort to intimidate shareholders. This came on the heels of speculation that Russia wished to “buy out the sharehold­\ners of TNK-BP as part of its campaign to tighten control of the country’s energy assets.”[70] In a related vein, the BP-TNK\nCEO was forced to leave the country after Russian authorities refused to renew his visa.[71] Also in 2008, an important\nBP incident which did not appear to directly involve Russia occurred. Off the coast of Azerbaijan at the Central Azeri\nplatform in the Caspian Sea, one of BP’s off-shore rigs suffered a blowout nearly identical to that of the Deepwater\nHorizon. The gas did not ignite, and no one was killed, however it did cost around $50 Million a day in losses for the\nAzeri government. BP purposefully kept all details of the incident under close wraps verging on a cover-up. Then the\nDeepwater Horizon event occurs in 2010, followed by the sale of TNK-BP to Russian state-run Rosneft in 2012 as part\nof the asset divestment program initiated to pay for the spill. In that deal, BP also purchased shares in Rosneft, upping\ntheir stake from 1.25% to 20% and receiving two seats on the board of directors, including one which was awarded to\nBP’s current CEO Robert Dudley—the same gentleman who was forced to flee in 2008 over an un-renewed visa. How­\never, according to a Reuter’s article published on March 4[th] of this year “…as a state appointee, Dudley would have to\nvote by government directive on major issues, such as large deals and key appointments.”[ 72] This remark is in contrast\nto another individual who had “been nominated as an independent and as such can decide for himself how to vote.”[ 73]\n\n###### 66 (Kennedy, 2006) 67  Ibid. 68 (Kramer, 2007) 69 (Hodgson, 2008) 70  Ibid. 71 (Webb, 2008) 72  http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/03/04/uk-bp-rosneft-idUKBRE92310W20130304?feedType%3DRSS %26feedName%3DbusinessNews\n\n\n-----\n\nsupporting context for eventual conclusions drawn about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Following the collapse of the\nSoviet Union in 1991, many of the state owned oil and gas assets were sold at significantly discounted values to private\nindividuals creating an economic void for a fragile new country already plagued by monetary issues in other sectors.\nRussia faltered economically for most of the 1990’s until Vladimir Putin was elected President in 2000 under a banner of\nplanned economic prosperity. Putin is an interesting figure, and has played prominently in Russia’s return to the world\nstage. A former KGB member, Putin has sought the consolidation and reclaim of critical sectors of the Russian economy,\nmost notably the energy sector. Using strong-arm tactics and political pressure, he has set the tone for Russia’s future\npolicy. In 2006, Russia temporarily turned off the gas it was supplying to the Ukraine, inciting conflict and unrest with\nother European countries. The move was cast as an overt attempt to regulate natural resource prices for a market in\nwhich Russia controls production and reaps profits from a customer base with limited alternate supply. Russia used the\ntactic again in 2009, shutting off gas supplies for two weeks to Ukrainian Naftogaz ostensibly because of a dispute over\ncontract terms which had been negotiated in 2002 regarding the appropriation of gas by Naftogas. The ordeal was only\nresolved after Ukraine’s Prime Minister sat down with Vladimir Putin and renegotiated a new contract for Russian gas, for\nwhich she later received a 7 year sentence on charges of abuse of power.\n\nThese events serve to highlight the importance Russia places on the energy sector as both a vital portion of its\neconomy and a potent political tool. The Russian economy is heavily dependent on the oil & gas industries, with 62.7% of\nits economy being service based industries in 2010.[74] Many economists have pointed to oil and gas prices as the Achil­\nles heel of the Russian economy.[757677] This was made evident in 2008 when oil prices plummeted (as seen in the figure\nbelow), sending the Russian economy spiraling into a recession. Prices hit a low in 2009, one year before Deepwater\nHorizon and at a time when reports were also stating that the overall output of Russian oil for 2010 was projected to\ndecline.[78] This stagnation in the economy combined with future projections of slowed oil production presented a huge\nthreat to Russia, and it is likely that this sentiment resonated with Russian authorities. As pointed out by a Forbes colum­\nnist, a sustained drop in oil prices like that in 2008 would mean possible civil unrest and political instability – oil and gas\nhave that magnitude of effect.[79]\n\nThis resonance may perhaps be seen in the Russian National Security Strategy to 2020 published in May of\n2009. The document outlines a path for Russia to continue to regain prominent global power, and within it there are\nseveral points which lend credence to a strategic view of oil and gas resources. The document states that “the longerterm focus of international politics will concentrate on the possession of energy resources, notably in the Middle East, on\nthe Barents Sea shelf and other areas of the Arctic, in the Caspian Sea Basin, and in Central Asia.“[80] The same publication\n\n###### 74  CIA Factbook 2012 75  http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2012/04/03/oil-a-problem-for-russian-economy-official-says/ 76  http://www.ssb.no/a/publikasjoner/pdf/DP/dp617.pdf 77  http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Putin-Plays-Down-Russias-Deadly-Dependence-on-Oil-Gas- Revenues.html 78  http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/10/14/russia-oil-production-idUSLE70186320091014 79  http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2012/12/01/russia-and-oil-a-recipe-for-preservation-of- the-status-quo/\n\n\n-----\n\nnecessarily indicate a military kinetic action, but exertion of both soft and hard power across all domains, including cyber.\n\nWhat follows is a purely speculative narrative of one possible attack scenario, intended to highlight elements of\nRussian doctrine which align with aspects of the BP oil spill. It will also include techniques and tools which provide func­\ntionality that makes such an attack feasible.\n\nSo it is possible that after the oil price crash in 2008, Russian officials saw the danger to social and political stabil­\nity in the country. Forecasts for Russian oil output around 2009 also suggested that not only were prices dropping, but\noverall production would as well, envisaging the specter of future unrest and hardship. Realizing the strategic importance\nof oil and the success they had garnered with previous market halts, they needed a way to either artificially inflate oil\nprices, increase demand for Russian oil, or increase oil output. It is worth noting that price of natural gas (another huge\ncomponent of the Russian economy) is inextricably linked to oil prices in most of Europe during this period because gas\nis price-indexed against oil. Unlike the natural gas incidents where Russia was able to use state-controlled Gazprom to\nhalt gas leaving the country, a sizeable portion of the oil leaving the country was from privatized companies. It would be\ndifficult to overtly prevent them from exporting without significant backlash from international communities (such as the\nWorld Trade Organization where they had been seeking entry for some time), so action would need to be more covert.\nOne of the largest of these private oil firms was TNK-BP, which Russian authorities had already attempted to strong-arm\ninto government control as they had done with other smaller oil companies like Yukos. The other main exporter of oil to\nWestern Europe at this time was BP plc, the 50% owner of TNK-BP. Therefore, control of TNK-BP would both increase oil\nrevenues and state-output, and simultaneously decrease a prime competitor’s overall output. It would also give them a\nlarger political weapon that could be used as a bargaining chip or to meet the aforementioned goal of price control. How­\never, BP had proven recalcitrant and defiant about relinquishing TNK-BP in spite of the pressures which had already been\napplied. A past rocky relationship with BP combined with their recent safety failures and cover-up in the Caspian Sea also\nmade them a viable target.\n\nIf they could not be motivated by conventional means, then Russia would have to revert to force as pointed out\nearlier in their National Security Strategy to 2020 (“the competitive search for resources does not exclude the use of\nforce”). Sabotage could be a viable option, however it would have to be on a large enough scale that BP would be put\ninto a position where they would fold to Russian interests under the additional pressure. While an on-shore explosion\nwould cause some delays in production and potential loss of life leading to litigation, off-shore destruction would have\nthe potential to be significantly more damaging publicly, could also include loss of life, and would incur significant envi­\nronmental fines in addition to safety fines.\n\nThe question would then be where to strike – BP holdings in the Caspian Sea would be too dangerous as any fail­\nures could easily implicate Russia and any success could cause collateral damage to Russian oil assets and coastal regions.\nThe North Sea would be a potentially viable candidate with multiple countries being affected resulting in more economic\nimpact on BP, however the currents are such that collateral damage could occur to other areas that Russia identified as\nvital fields of competition, namely the Barents Sea. BP’s other major developments were in relatively new fields in the\nGulf of Mexico (GoM) where BP planned to invest heavily. Russia has long seen (and continues to see) American power\nas a dangerous counter to its own, marking the US as its top global competitor. The GoM then would prove very attrac­\ntive as it offered a two-fold bonus. A cash-strapped United States, riddled by its own recession, would bear the brunt of\nthe collateral damage resulting in heavy fines to BP, perhaps made heavier because of the state of the American econo­\nmy. Secondly, BP would possibly lose its asset(s) and right to drill offshore in the GoM, a region BP considered strategic.\nIt would allow for an information influence operation on the American public – poisoning the market against BP, but also\npotentially against the American government if they repeated any mistakes in their handling of an incident like the 2005\nHurricane Katrina rescue and relief effort.\n\nAmerica in 2008 and 2009 was already facing internal contention over deep water drilling practices, meaning\nthat a significant event in the region could perhaps halt production by governmental directive. Even with the contention,\nBP had already made history in the Gulf; in mid-2009 the Deepwater Horizon rig finished drilling the deepest oil well in\nhistory in the Tiber Oil Field off the coast of Texas. This meant that one of the top competitors for Russian oil exports was\nmaking headway in this region. America is also the largest importer of oil, so even though oil prices are a complicated af­\nfair that takes into account aspects like the economic stability of different regions and future projections of demand, any\ndamaging effects on American production or supply could potentially increase oil prices.\n\nIn March of 2009, drilling of a new well, Macondo, was approved and scheduled to begin later that year, creating\n\n\n-----\n\neral GoM targets, perhaps alongside BP North Sea assets as well. Having the Gulf of Mexico in mind, Russia now needed\na method for delivery. Analyzing the 2008 incident in the Caspian Sea which was still fresh at this time, it may have been\nnoted that one of the root causes of the blowout was a flaw in the concrete—concrete possibly provided by the same\nUS contractor who worked for BP in the GoM: Halliburton. They may have also surmised that if the alarms and safety\nsystems had not activated in the Caspian Sea incident, the crew may not have been capable of reacting quickly enough to\nprevent an explosion, thus creating a terrible ecological disaster and causing loss of life.\n\nSo, a workable option appeared to be a covert cyber-attack on rigs operating in the gulf which disabled safety\nmeasures or created a situation where a blowout would occur. If done correctly, they could easily hide any attribution\nbehind China (who had been actively stealing secrets from oil companies at this time), a non-state hacking group, a spo­\nradic virus, or merely a glitch/accident. Because of the high stakes involved in any attribution to Russia, the best option\nwould be making it purely appear to be an accident or neglect by BP and its contractors. This could be achieved by play­\ning on known patterns and behaviors by BP that were risky. The type of intelligence Russia would have been intimately\nfamiliar with through their own dealings with BP and analysis of other BP safety incident in the recent past. This blends\nseamlessly with the Russian concept of “Reflexive Control.”\n\nTimothy Thomas points out in his book entitled “Recasting the Red Star” the concept of reflexive control—as\nTimothy puts it: “Reflexive control is defined as a means of conveying to a partner or an opponent specially prepared\ninformation to incline him to voluntarily make the predetermined decision desired by the initiator of the action.”[82]\nPurposefully setting false alarms off in the early hours of the morning so that someone will disable them would be a\ngood example of this. Russian hackers such as the GLEG group have demonstrated proficiency in finding exploits in ICS\nsoftware by releasing the Agora SCADA+ exploit kit which had a plethora of zero-day exploits in it.[83] This demonstrative\nproficiency, combined with the previously noted 2009 Mario Azar incident would suggest that the technical capability to\nset this in motion was readily available. After identifying several targets in the GoM, Russian operators could easily have\nexploited a multitude of attack vectors. Employee’s personal systems (which could have VPN access to onshore control\nstations or the rig directly), mobile devices like smart-phones, portable storage devices such as usb drives, engineer\nlaptops, or an onshore control center with access to the rigs could have been leveraged to gain access. Such attacks could\nbe trivially done even with open-source or free tools such as the iconic Metasploit Framework. Metasploit’s custom pay­\nload, Meterpreter, for example is capable of residing purely in volatile memory, often leaving few residual traces on per­\nsistent storage, if any. After identifying an entry point such as social engineering (perhaps too high profile) or more likely\nexploitation, Russian operatives could find a series of servers at the onshore control center with a long up-time or that\nwere not regularly updated (and therefore not regularly restarted). The attackers could have leveraged these to create\nredundant avenues of access which run entirely in volatile memory, thus leaving minimal to no permanent traces. More\nlikely and stable however would be the use of such exploitation to install a persistent backdoor. From here they could\nhave stolen credentials or otherwise escalated privileges to gain access to the safety systems on the Deepwater Horizon\nand other rigs operating in the area. It is likely that the same attack vector would not have been used in every instance to\nobscure any pattern analysis and diversify opportunities for success. At this point setting off alarms in the early hours to\nencourage employees to disable them, impairing other safety systems and causing general instability would have been\nenough to subtly magnify the effects beyond a manageable level resulting in catastrophe.\n\nAfter having discussed in some detail the possibility of a state actor’s involvement, it must equally be considered\nthat there is also plenty of evidence suggesting that this was nothing more than a tragic incident. It may also be stated\nthat there is evidence contrary to the posed scenario. The Deepwater horizon incident and the 2008 Caspian Sea incident\nbefore it were merely two incidents in an industry fraught with others.  Additionally, two incidents—regardless of simi­\nlarity—are not conclusive enough to represent a pattern. Should they be a part of a larger pattern, it is far more likely\nthat these particular incidents pointed to a pattern of corporate neglect than anything else. The inherently dangerous\nnature of oil refinery work would imply that accidents and loss of life are an unfortunate reality of the industry. Accord­\ning to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “The fatality rate for oil and gas workers in the U.S. between 2002\nand 2007 was more than 29 deaths per 100,000 workers, or about seven times the average for all occupations.”[84] BP is\nno stranger to such hazards. Deepwater Horizon, though perhaps their worst to date, was not their first prolific disaster.\nBP was required to pay 1.6 billion dollars in victim compensation for the Texas City refinery explosion from March 23,\n2005. They were also required to pay 50.6 million dollars in fines for failing to fix the safety violations that were brought\n\n###### 82  Recasting the Red Star 83  https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/pdf/ICSA-11-096-01.pdf 84  Centers for Disease Control.

This in part serves to highlight the fact that even if the incident were to\nbe a state-sponsored attack, the impact of the loss of a single rig or small well is relatively inconsequential to the overall\noil production of the victim. The timeline of the Deepwater Horizon incident also speaks volumes – the incident took\nplace over the course of at least a year and was the product of many budget-saving decisions that were acknowledged\nto be dangerous by the engineers who were working on the Macondo well drilling effort. These measures and a culture\nof risk are likely what ultimately sealed the fate of the Deepwater Horizon. These occurrences are too intricate whilst\nspread over such an extended period of time for any one entity to have reasonably controlled them all.\n\nIt is within human nature to look for a pattern or design for an event even when there isn’t any – this can be aug­\nmented by time as more possible “clues” become apparent. For this reason such attribution which seeks out a conclu­\nsion is a slippery slope and must be approached with caution—it has a tendency to entice analysts to find facts to fit the\nhypothesis as opposed to a hypothesis which fits the facts. It’s important to remember that correlation does not equal\ncausation; in fact correlation may be coincidental or the result of another unanticipated factor. Likewise the circumstan­\ntial evidence alone is not conclusive. Between 1969 and 2005 there have been over 30 separate incidents on oil rigs\nranging from fires and explosions, to structural failures, some of which were blowouts not unlike the one that occurred\non Deepwater Horizon. It is likely that circumstantial information about one or more of these could be strung together to\nprovide a reasonably convincing political ‘attribution.’\n\nRegardless of the attribution or refutation of an attack, the takeaway from the Deepwater Horizon analysis is that\nthe oil industry is undeniably tied to the cyber domain and an attack on this sector is conceivable; that by using currently\navailable cyber means a kinetic, violent, and instrumental outcome could very possibly be affected on a private sector by\na foreign state actor or other human-based agent to gain a favorable outcome.\n\n###### 85  BBC News, BP agrees to pay record 50.6m fine for Texas explosion. (2010, August, 12) http://www.bbc.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe observation of a moderately sized cross-section of cyber events within the oil and gas industry clearly\nindicates that there is ongoing cyber conflict. This conflict exists in the form of espionage and sabotage, and it involves\nboth state and non-state actors. In the case of cyber espionage, these actors are advanced in the sense that they have\nlaunched multi-year campaigns which have gone undetected as they have exflitrated what is likely untold billions of dol­\nlars in intellectual property. There tactics represent a formalization and ritualization of the conflict which will suggests\nthat it has been weaponized and will continue to escalate in the future. The Chinese government is absolutely involved\nin some capacity, and stands to gain the most out if these transactions. China will need to continue to make aggressive\nmoves to sustain its need for oil going forward as its ability to meet growing demand becomes overwhelmed. Red Octo­\nber, while largely targeted at diplomatic entities, also targeted the oil and gas industry. The sophistication of the infra­\nstructure used in Red October, as well as the methods, suggest a revolution in the type of cyber conflict that will be seen\nin the oil and gas industry. A majority of these groups are still active as of April 2013, even after being outed in reports\nreleased by antivirus and incident response companies over the last few years. These reports themselves represent one\naspect in which non-state actors will become ever more important in cyber conflict, particularly within important indus­\ntries such as oil and gas. American companies are particularly vulnerable targets to state-backed or state-owned foreign\ncompetitors who may in the future leverage their countries’ cyber forces to gain competitive advantage, or possible\ndevelop their own.\n\nThis type of competitiveness may lead to the types of sabotage exchanges seen in the Middle East. These attacks\nmay either have been the work of nation-states battling out policy in the cyber realm, or unconnected events with the\nShamoon attacks merely being a disaffected hacktivist group expressing dissent. Regardless of origin, these exchanges\nare clear examples of cyber conflict of a destructive nature. Going forward, the sophistication of the viruses used in these\nattacks will likely only increase. Attacks like the flame and Stuxnet viruses may be seen by American companies within\nthe industry. The line between espionage and sabotage attacks can be somewhat blurred with viruses being modular and\nhaving the capability to perform both; gathering intel while waiting undetected to unleash a more sinister capability. The\nvery use of these types of malware breeds and intimacy and familiarity with them that allows for their further prolifera­\ntion by the parties who were previously attacked. Even if they cannot reverse engineer them, they may understand the\nbehaviors well enough to crudely mimic them.\n\nAs discussed at the beginning of the paper, cyber conflict is attractive. It is attractive to criminal elements, corpo­\nrate elements, individuals, hacktivists, state actors, and other sundry non-state actors alike. Because of its low barrier to\nentry, availability, and outsized impact, the oil industry must prepare for sustained future conflict in this realm.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Appendix A - Definitions\n\n**Advanced Persistent Threat: An advanced persistent threat (APT) uses multiple phases to break into a network, avoid**\ndetection, and harvest valuable information over the long term.
