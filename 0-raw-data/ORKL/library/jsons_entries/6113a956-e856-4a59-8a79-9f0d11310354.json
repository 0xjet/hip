Investigating this group's activity, we determined they are an Initial Access Broker\n(IAB) who appear to be working with the Russian cyber crime gang known as FIN12\n(Mandiant, FireEye) / WIZARD SPIDER (CrowdStrike).\n\nInitial access brokers are the opportunistic locksmiths of the security world, and it’s a full-time\njob. These groups specialize in breaching a target in order to open the doors—or the\nWindows—to the malicious actor with the highest bid.\n\nEXOTIC LILY is a resourceful, financially motivated group whose activities appear to be\nclosely linked with data exfiltration and deployment of human-operated ransomware such as\n[Conti and](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-265a) [Diavol. At the peak of EXOTIC LILY’s activity, we estimate they were sending more](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220120.pdf)\nthan 5,000 emails a day, to as many as 650 targeted organizations globally. Up until\nNovember 2021, the group seemed to be targeting specific industries such as IT,\ncybersecurity and healthcare, but as of late we have seen them attacking a wide variety of\norganizations and industries, with less specific focus.\n\nWe have observed this threat actor deploying tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) that\nare traditionally associated with more targeted attacks, like spoofing companies and\nemployees as a means of gaining trust of a targeted organization through email campaigns\nthat are believed to be sent by real human operators using little-to-no automation.\nAdditionally and rather uniquely, they leverage legitimate file-sharing services like\nWeTransfer, TransferNow and OneDrive to deliver the payload, further evading detection\nmechanisms. This level of human-interaction is rather unusual for cyber crime groups\nfocused on mass scale operations.\n\n## Spoofing Organizations and Identities\n\nEXOTIC LILY’s attack chain has remained relatively consistent throughout the time we’ve\nbeen tracking the group:\n\n\n-----\n\nOne notable technique is the use of domain and identity spoofing as a way of gaining\nadditional credibility with a targeted organization. In the majority of cases, a spoofed domain\nname was identical to a real domain name of an existing organization, with the only\ndifference being a change of TLD to “.us”, “.co” or “.biz”.\n\nInitially, the group would create entirely fake personas posing as employees of a real\ncompany. That would sometimes consist of creating social media profiles, personal websites\n[and generating a fake profile picture using a public service to create an AI-generated human](https://boredhumans.com/faces.php)\nface. In November 2021, the group began to impersonate real company employees by\ncopying their personal data from social media and business databases such as\nRocketReach and CrunchBase.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the fake social media profiles created by EXOTIC LILY\n\nUsing spoofed email accounts, attackers would then send spear phishing emails under the\npretext of a business proposal, such as seeking to outsource a software development project\nor an information security service.\n\nExample of an EXOTIC LILY phishing email impersonating as an employee of a legitimate\ncompany\n\n\n-----\n\nAttackers would sometimes engage in further communication with the target by attempting to\nschedule a meeting to discuss the project's design or requirements.\n\nAt the final stage, the attacker would upload the payload to a public file-sharing service\n(TransferNow, TransferXL, WeTransfer or OneDrive) and then use a built-in email notification\nfeature to share the file with the target, allowing the final email to originate from the email\naddress of a legitimate file-sharing service and not the attacker’s email, which presents\nadditional detection challenges.\n\nAttacker uses a file-sharing service email notification feature to send BazarLoader ISO\npayload\n\n## Human-Operated Phishing at Scale\n\nFurther evidence suggests an operator’s responsibilities might include:\n\ncustomizing the initial “business proposal” templates when first reaching out to a\ntargeted organization;\nhandling further communications in order to gain affinity and trust;\nuploading malware (acquired from another group) to a file-sharing service prior to\nsharing it with the target.\n\nA breakdown of the actor’s communication activity shows the operators are working a fairly\ntypical 9-to-5 job, with very little activity during the weekends. Distribution of the actor’s\nworking hours suggest they might be working from a Central or an Eastern Europe timezone.\n\n\n-----\n\nBreakdown of actor’s communication activity. Deeper color indicates more activity.\n\n## Malware and Attribution\n\nAlthough the group came to our attention initially due to its use of documents containing an\nexploit for CVE-2021-40444, they later switched to the delivery of ISO files with hidden\nBazarLoader DLLs and LNK shortcuts. These samples have some indicators that suggest\nthey were custom-built to be used by the group. For example, metadata embedded in the\nLNK shortcuts shows that a number of fields, such as the “Machine Identifier” and “Drive\nSerial Number” were shared with BazarLoader ISOs distributed via other means, however\nother fields such as the command line arguments were unique for samples distributed by\nEXOTIC LILY.\n\nIn March, the group continued delivering ISO files, but with a DLL containing a custom loader\nwhich is a more advanced variant of a first-stage payload previously seen during CVE-202140444 exploitation. The loader can be recognized by its use of a unique user-agent\n“bumblebee” which both variants share. The malware, hence dubbed BUMBLEBEE, uses\nWMI to collect various system details such as OS version, user name and domain name,\nwhich are then exfiltrated in JSON format to a C2. In response, it expects to receive one of\nthe several supported “tasks”, which include execution of shellcode, dropping and running\nexecutable files. At the time of the analysis, BUMBLEBEE was observed to fetch Cobalt\n[Strike payloads This malware can be found using this VirusTotal query](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/behavior_network%253Abumblebee%2520(type%253Apeexe%2520OR%2520type%253Apedll)/files)\n\n\n-----\n\nEXOTIC LILY activities overlap with a group tracked as DEV-0413 (Microsoft) and were also\n[described by Abnormal in their recent post. Earlier reports of attacks exploiting CVE-2021-](https://abnormalsecurity.com/blog/bazarloader-contact-form)\n[40444 (by Microsoft and other members of the security community) have also indicated](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/15/analyzing-attacks-that-exploit-the-mshtml-cve-2021-40444-vulnerability/)\noverlaps between domains involved in the delivery chain of an exploit and infrastructure used\nfor BazarLoader and Trickbot distribution.\n\nWe believe the shift to deliver BazarLoader, along with some other indicators such as a\n[unique Cobalt Strike profile (described by RiskIQ) further confirms the existence of a](https://community.riskiq.com/article/c88cf7e6)\nrelationship between EXOTIC LILY and actions of a Russian cyber crime group tracked as\nWIZARD SPIDER (CrowdStrike), FIN12 (Mandiant, FireEye) and DEV-0193 (Microsoft).\nWhile the nature of those relationships remains unclear, EXOTIC LILY seems to operate as a\nseparate entity, focusing on acquiring initial access through email campaigns, with follow-up\nactivities that include deployment of Conti and Diavol ransomware, which are performed by a\ndifferent set of actors.\n\n## Improving User Protection\n\nAs part of our efforts to combat serious threat actors, we use results of our research to\nimprove the safety and security of our products. In collaboration with Gmail and Safe\nBrowsing, we are improving protections by adding additional warnings for emails originating\nfrom website contact forms, better identification of spoofing, and adjusting the reputation of\nemail file sharing notifications. Additionally, we’re working with Google’s CyberCrime\nInvestigation Group to share relevant details and indicators with law enforcement.\n\nTAG is committed to sharing our findings as a way of raising awareness with the security\ncommunity, and with companies and individuals that might have been targeted or suffered\nfrom this threat actor’s activities. We hope that improved understanding of the group’s tactics\nand techniques will enhance threat hunting capability and lead to stronger user protections\nacross industry.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nRecent domains used in email campaigns:\n\nconlfex[.]com\navrobio[.]co\nelemblo[.]com\nphxmfg[.]co\nmodernmeadow[.]co\nlsoplexis[.]com\ncraneveyor[.]us\nfaustel[.]us\nlagauge[.]us\nmissionbio[.]us\n\n\n-----\n\nrichllndmetals[.]com\nkvnational[.]us\nprmflltration[.]com\nbrightlnsight[.]co\nbelcolnd[.]com\nawsblopharma[.]com\namevida[.]us\nrevergy[.]us\nal-ghurair[.]us\nopontia[.]us\n\nBazarLoader ISO samples:\n\n5ceb28316f29c3912332065eeaaebf59f10d79cd9388ef2a7802b9bb80d797be\n9fdec91231fe3a709c8d4ec39e25ce8c55282167c561b14917b52701494ac269\nc896ee848586dd0c61c2a821a03192a5efef1b4b4e03b48aba18eedab1b864f7\n\nRecent BUMBLEBEE ISO samples:\n\n9eacade8174f008c48ea57d43068dbce3d91093603db0511467c18252f60de32\n6214e19836c0c3c4bc94e23d6391c45ad87fdd890f6cbd3ab078650455c31dc8\n201c4d0070552d9dc06b76ee55479fc0a9dfacb6dbec6bbec5265e04644eebc9\n1fd5326034792c0f0fb00be77629a10ac9162b2f473f96072397a5d639da45dd\n01cc151149b5bf974449b00de08ce7dbf5eca77f55edd00982a959e48d017225\n\nRecent BUMBLEBEE C2:\n\n23.81.246[.]187:443\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n[Threat Analysis Group](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/%20)\n\n\n-----",
