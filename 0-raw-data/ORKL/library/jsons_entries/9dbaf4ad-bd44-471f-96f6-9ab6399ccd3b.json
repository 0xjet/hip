    "plain_text": "# A Baza Valentine’s Day\n\n**proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/baza-valentines-day**\n\n\nFebruary 11, 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n[Blog](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog)\n[Threat Insight](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight)\nA Baza Valentine’s Day\n\n\n-----\n\nFebruary 11, 2021 Proofpoint Threat Research Team\n\nIn 2020, Proofpoint observed an increase in BazaLoader campaign volume peaking in October. During that time, we\nobserved specific campaigns correlated to public reports of affiliate campaigns delivering BazaLoader and associated with\n[Ryuk ransomware infections. Notably, in January 2021, Proofpoint researchers observed a few of BazaLoader campaigns](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/kegtap-and-singlemalt-with-a-ransomware-chaser.html)\nleveraging Valentine's Day themes such as flowers and lingerie. The attack chains required an unusual amount of human\ninteraction before a payload was delivered. While we track a fair amount of BazaLoader delivered by TA800 and TA572,\nthese campaigns are not associated with either TA800 or TA572 and are likely leveraged by other affiliates.\n\n## BazaLoader Origin\n\nBazaLoader is a downloader written in C++ whose primary function is to download and execute additional modules. It was\nfirst observed in the wild in April 2020 and since has steadily been adopted by more actors. Proofpoint has observed at\nleast six variants of Bazaloader signaling active and continued development. One of the earliest BazaLoader variants\nProofpoint researchers identified used \".bazar\" top-level domains for command-and-control communication. The \".bazar\"\nTLDs are associated with cryptocurrency DNS named Emercoin using Blockchain services reported in early April 2020.\nToday, we do not see the same association to cryptocurrency infrastructure, but it is relevant to its provenance.\n\n## Valentine’s Day \n\nProofpoint researchers have spotted multiple BazaLoader campaigns in January and February 2021 involving the tactic of\nheavily relying on human interaction with different sites, PDF attachments, and [email lures. There were a range of lure and](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/top-5-email-phishing-lures)\nsubject topics, including compact storage devices, office supplies, pharmaceutical supplies, and sports nutrition, but what\nstuck out were campaigns that were timely and relevant to the upcoming Valentine’s Day holiday. The campaigns were\nspread across a diverse set of companies and sectors.\n\nValentine’s Day, while not abused to the level of other holidays, presents an opportunity for a variety of actors. The FBI\nBoston field office has posted public warnings of romance scams. While this is not a romance scam, it is an example of\nsocial engineering well-timed with the Valentine’s Day holiday.\n\n## Infection Chain\n\n_Figure 1: Infection Chain_\n\nThe infection chain is consistent in the latest campaigns. The websites the user would browse to are fake, but the actors\ntook care to have the physical addresses in the below images match a near-legitimate location. For\nexample, Ajour Lingerie is not located at 1133 50th St, Brooklyn, NY 11219, but this address is in physical proximity to\na legitimate website and physical business called the Lingerie Shop.\n\n_Figure 2: physical address to digital website_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Lingerie at Ajour\n\nThis campaign delivered PDF attachments that references a specific customer order number and associated purchased\nitems which entices the recipient to go to the Ajour Lingerie website. If the user visits the website and navigates to\nthe \"Contact Us\" page, they are then given the option to enter the order number in the order ID. If entered, the contact page\nthen redirects the user to the landing page that links to and explains how to open the Excel sheet. The Excel sheet contains\nmacros that, if enabled by the user, will download BazaLoader.\n\n_Figure 3: Email Lure_\n\n_Figure 4: Ajour Lingerie_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Landing Page_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Enable Content to deliver BazaLoader_\n\n## Flowers at Rose World \n\nThis campaign is nearly identical—enticing users to check an order number. The campaign delivered PDF attachments with\nreferences to purchases at the Rose World website. If the user visits the website, navigates to \"Contact Us\", and enters the\norder number in the order ID, the site will redirect the user to a landing page. This landing page links to and explains how to\n\n\n-----\n\nopen the Excel sheet. The Excel sheet contains macros that, if enabled, will download BazaLoader.\n\n_Figure 7: Rose World Customer Order Email_\n\n_Figure 8: Invoice with website_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: Rose World contact page and enter your order number_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: Enable Macros to receive Bazaloader_\n\n## Conclusion: \n\n\n-----\n\nProofpoint researchers have observed a steady growth in actors using BazaLoader as a 1st stage downloader. In addition\nto the uptick in BazaLoader distribution, there is active development of BazaLoader, particularly during the month of\nOctober 2020. These recent BazaLoader campaigns exemplify affiliate actors leveraging a loader that\nis increasingly popular and more reliant on human interaction. Further, the [social engineering features rely on the timeliness](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/cybersecurity-101-what-social-engineering)\nof the Valentine’s Day holiday and the intrinsic user curiosity to see what they may have ordered.
