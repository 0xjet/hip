It appears malware is\n**allowed to access the internet in many sandboxes** . So with that access I decided to collect\n\nall the environmental features I could think of and send them to my discord channel. Since\nPython is the language with the largest library support ever (maybe?) I wrote a python script to\ntake many environment features through `psutil,` `platform,` `cpuinfo etc. The whole`\n_[python code is here.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210613070852/https://gist.github.com/Albocoder/43827f62dceb0970d4810e3719b993d9)_\n\nThen we use pyinstaller to create a single executable (~10 MB ) using a command like this:\n```\npyinstaller --onefile --noupx sandbox-env-stealer.py . Then for the sake of\n\n```\ncompleteness we compressed the executable in the latest upx and uploaded to VirusTotal. After\na few crashes we ended with 4 samples:\n\n[47ed17bdea1dab10fdee…](https://web.archive.org/web/20210613070852/https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/47ed17bdea1dab10fdee7f61dff8b8f33ad5d092b3e1e5f0f5a3522a27798183/detection)\n[07a783fc3ae6a065dc0b…](https://web.archive.org/web/20210613070852/https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/07a783fc3ae6a065dc0bfad5e8f89ec3ae5be3bb1ec8ada6f774710399f65305/detection)\n[e472c0493a9a35b7975c…](https://web.archive.org/web/20210613070852/https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e472c0493a9a35b7975ca2b5acb4663746993c55c6f2d94742d301d88f050e95/detection)\n\n[88d38301327da310c5c0… (disregard the file name](https://web.archive.org/web/20210613070852/https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/88d38301327da310c5c00a0b3ae8209730e033f3c57575a447096d94a647e816/detection) )\n\nOf course, you can [download the data I collected and play for yourself.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210613070852/https:/albocoder.github.io/assets/misc/sandbox_reports.zip)\n\n## Experiment setup\n\nI submitted one of the first samples on 17/03/2020 (because corona lockdown was getting\nboring). Then life happened. After deciding to revisit this project I submitted the other 4 samples\naround March 2021. I collected the following features (some ommited for brevity):\n\nWindows version + arch\nCPU name + core count\nlocal and internet IP address\nCPU counters\ndisk partitions and counters\n\n## What did learn?\n\n\n-----\n\n### OS version\n\nFirst, I noticed that 78% of all the sandboxes run Windows 7 build 7601 (the most famous\n\npirated version ). That accounts for 40 out of the 51 executions. The table below illustrates\n\nit all. As it seems, the only versions are Windows 7 (build 7600 and 7601) and some flavor of\nWindows 10. A malware sample will have a high chance of being run on a real machine if the\ndetected OS is anything but the following.\n\n**OS version** **# execs**\n\nWin 7 build 7601 40\n\nWin 10.0.18362 3\n\nWin 7 build 7600 3\n\nWin 10.0.14393 3\n\nWin 10.0.17134 2\n\n### Timeline analysis\n\nIn this section I will analyze some runtime features of the sandboxes. Here there are some\ninteresting features malware authors can use to quickly identify sandboxes. There are also\nsome lessons I learned from looking at the executions.\n\nFirst off, I wanted to see how many executions we were getting per malware and how often.\n[This is particularly important since in our paper we showed that a malware need to run in 3](https://web.archive.org/web/20210613070852/https:/albocoder.github.io/assets/pdf_files/malw_variability.pdf)\nrandom environments at least every 3 weeks.\n\nIt appears, for the oldest malware sample 10 executions appear on the same day as the\nsubmission, 1 execution 1 day later, 3 executions 33 days later and 2 executions 62 days later.\nThis means that the sample was deemed interesting 2 months from its first “appearance”.\nHowever, we can’t conclude that this is what happens for all the samples, with different number\nof VT engine detections or with more interest from individual AV vendors. For the record, I did\nget an execution report back from the first sample just yesterday, after clicking the “reanalyze”\n\non VT . Either way, the malware was executed about 2 to 3 times every month, which is\n\nclose enough to 3 weeks (that we recommend in our paper), but we demonstrated in the paper\nthat on average 1 week stale of data decreases the detection rate.\n\n### Environment analysis\n\nThis sections will show some environment features that the malware can read.\n\n**The running processes**\n\n\n-----\n\nA common routine seen on many malware and benign samples is that or iterating the running\nprocesses. I (as in python libraries) use a similar routine to retrieve the running processes. The\ntable below shows some of the running processes and the number of machines they were seen\nto run on. Something interesting we can see here are the “special” programs. In some\nmachines we see the appearance of `bitcoin-qt.exe,` `infinium.exe etc, while in some`\nothers we see `steam.exe,` `SteamService.exe etc, in some others` `filezilla.exe or`\n```\ncentralcreditcard.exe . This is usually done to see if the malware is a crypto miner, a\n\n```\ngame hack, a file infector or a point-of-sale malware respectively.\n\n\n**Processes**\n\n\n**Number**\n**of**\n**machines**\n\n\n... ...\n\nconhost.exe 47\n\nlsass.exe 46\n\nspoolsv.exe 46\n\nwininit.exe 46\n\nsmss.exe 46\n\nSystem Idle Process 46\n\nexplorer.exe 46\n\nwinlogon.exe 46\n\nSystem 46\n\nservices.exe 46\n\nopera.exe 43\n\nfirefox.exe 43\n\ndwm.exe 41\n\nlsm.exe 40\n\nSkype.exe 29\n\nOSPPSVC.EXE 27\n\ntaskeng.exe 24\n\n... ...\n\nbitcoin-qt.exe 14\n\n\n-----\n\ninfium.exe 14\n\nqip.exe 14\n\ncommunicator.exe 14\n\nbitcoind.exe 14\n\nsteam.exe 14\n\nsppsvc.exe 12\n\nvslvqrlijtvi.exe 12\n\nsplwow64.exe 12\n\nartifact.exe 10\n\nfontdrvhost.exe 10\n\nSteamService.exe 9\n\nSearchProtocolHost.exe 9\n\nSearchFilterHost.exe 9\n\nGoogleUpdate.exe 8\n\ndllhost.exe 8\n\nioynossujx.exe 8\n\nwqwupyjrsw.exe 8\n\nnotepad.exe 8\n\ntaskmgr.exe 7\n\nONENOTEM.EXE 7\n\nsihost.exe 6\n\nvmtoolsd.exe 6\n\nSearchUI.exe 6\n\nTrustedInstaller.exe 6\n\n1a7446534577bab0984f5eb275bdf1f43ed92dfc.exe 6\n\nivpvkimw.exe 6\n\nutg2.exe 6\n\n\n-----\n\nHelios12.exe 5\n\nOfficeClickToRun.exe 5\n\nOmniPOS.exe 5\n\nifs.exe 5\n\nEdcSvr.exe 5\n\nRegistry 5\n\nOUTLOOK.EXE 5\n\nwmpnetwk.exe 5\n\nCentralCreditCard.exe 5\n\n8lfuaq3.exe 4\n\nSophosFileScanner.exe 4\n\ne5d46536.exe 4\n\nSgrmBroker.exe 4\n\nnvtray.exe 4\n\nhmpalert.exe 4\n\n350befaf.exe 4\n\n1a34b48b.exe 4\n\navp.exe 3\n\nSEDService.exe 3\n\nTcpview.exe 3\n\nmp3tray.exe 3\n\nInstallRite.exe 3\n\nSavService.exe 3\n\nscap.exe 3\n\nmscorsvw.exe 3\n\nSAVAdminService.exe 3\n\nsdrservice.exe 3\n\n\n-----\n\nStartMenuExperienceHost.exe 3\n\nProcmon.exe 3\n\nbackgroundTaskHost.exe 3\n\nHttpLog.exe 3\n\nShellExperienceHost.exe 3\n\ntaskhostw.exe 3\n\npopwack.exe 3\n\nmsdtc.exe 3\n\nsedsvc.exe 3\n\navpui.exe 3\n\nprocexp64.exe 3\n\nProcmon64.exe 3\n\nSophosCleanM64.exe 2\n\nmodule-cargo.exe 2\n\nWindowsInternal.ComposableShell.Experiences.TextInput.InputApp.exe 2\n\nMemCompression 2\n\nDS5FEMT81XbOM0LW.exe 2\n\nSecurityHealthService.exe 2\n\n88d38301327da310c5c00a0b3ae8209730e033f3c57575a447096d94a647e816.exe 2\n\nswc_service.exe 2\n\nKMSAuto Net.exe 2\n\n3sO7_zsS.exe 2\n\nSophosFS.exe 2\n\nTiWorker.exe 2\n\ns35zi2y.exe 2\n\nld8itap.exe 2\n\nSophosNtpService.exe 2\n\n\n-----\n\nGoogleUpdateSetup.exe 2\n\nSSPService.exe 2\n\nswi_service.exe 2\n\npythonw.exe 2\n\nWbjiETqs.exe 2\n\nctfmon.exe 2\n\npw.exe 2\n\nswi_filter.exe 2\n\nhltpwzd.exe 2\n\nSophos.Encryption.BitLockerService.exe 2\n\nuniform-98682.exe 2\n\n8eu3umxnf.exe 2\n\nSophosIPS.exe 2\n\nunion_rechnung_install_39213.exe 2\n\nuserinit.exe 2\n\ngzqhbp.exe 2\n\n05a62b54.exe 2\n\nSophosSafestore64.exe 2\n\nsdcservice.exe 2\n\nswi_fc.exe 2\n\n3myJvMOn.exe 2\n\nWmiApSrv.exe 2\n\n\ncuckoo47ed17bdea1dab10fdee7f61dff8b8f33ad5d092b3e1e5f0f5a3522a27798183.exe\n\n\n2\n\n\nmtwebooS.exe 2\n\n05a62b54e6e32c406f33d22634b03fe8.exe 2\n\nSnrUNWUv.exe 2\n\nmsiexec.exe 2\n\n\n-----\n\nfollow-sneaky-on-twitch.exe 2\n\nSophosHealth.exe 2\n\n... ...\n\nabsolutetelnet.exe 1\n\ngmmeby.exe 1\n\noutlook.exe 1\n\nisspos.exe 1\n\nqgksae.exe 1\n\ntotalcmd.exe 1\n\nncftp.exe 1\n\nwhatsapp.exe 1\n\nigfxCUIService.exe 1\n\nwinscp.exe 1\n\ncoreftp.exe 1\n\nbarca.exe 1\n\nsocbristol.exe 1\n\nrundll32.exe 1\n\naccupos.exe 1\n\nbedrooms-story-avoid.exe 1\n\nactive-charge.exe 1\n\nfling.exe 1\n\nvrmafl.exe 1\n\ngmailnotifierpro.exe 1\n\npidgin.exe 1\n\ndiaryrecent.exe 1\n\ncreditservice.exe 1\n\noperamail.exe 1\n\n\n-----\n\ncentralcreditcard.exe 1\n\nunsecapp.exe 1\n\nAutoKMS.exe 1\n\nmedical reservoir.exe 1\n\nalftp.exe 1\n\nnetsh.exe 1\n\nwspsvc.exe 1\n\nscriptftp.exe 1\n\nspgagentservice.exe 1\n\nslwvdq.exe 1\n\nedcsvr.exe 1\n\nSysmon.exe 1\n\namerican.exe 1\n\nwmi64.exe 1\n\nflashfxp.exe 1\n\naxdnik.exe 1\n\nwebpagepioneer.exe 1\n\nskype.exe 1\n\nMemory Compression 1\n\nfpos.exe 1\n\nApplicationFrameHost.exe 1\n\nfilezilla.exe 1\n\nspcwin.exe 1\n\nUnfortunately, we can also see things like `cuckoo-`\n```\n47ed17bdea1dab10fdee7f61dff8b8f33ad5d092b3e1e5f0f5a3522a27798183.exe or\n1a7446534577bab0984f5eb275bdf1f43ed92dfc.exe which is simply the checksum hash of\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nthe sample.

For the most\npart I was underwhelmed. It appears the machine name remains the same across executions,\nwhich may be easy for an attacker to just submit bogus “malware” just to harvest all the\nmachine names. In terms of the context I did see that sometimes the sample was executed as\n```\nAdministrator meaning that some sandboxes give the “malware” admin privilleges.

I realized the\n```\nplatform.processor() was not returning the actual CPU name, but it was too late when I\n\n```\nrealized so I used the available information from this command and scrapped some tables\n[online to get the processor name (here is the pkl file that aggregates all data). In the latest](https://web.archive.org/web/20210613070852/https:/albocoder.github.io/assets/misc/cpu_name_database.pkl)\nversion I added this awesome library called `cpuinfo, so in case you need to collect your own`\ndata the cpuinfo will do the work.\n\n**number of cores** **potential cores**\n\n1 { 8, 4 }\n\n1 { 8, 4 }\n\n\n-----\n\n**number of cores** **potential cores**\n\n1 { 8, 4 }\n\n\n4 { 16 }\n\n2 { 8, 4 }\n\n\n1 { 8, 4 }\n\n1 { 8, 4 }\n\n\n1 { 8, 4 }\n\n1 { 8, 4 }\n\n\nAs hypothesized, the machine has the wrong number of cores for the CPU name (VICTORY\n\n). In the 9 machines, I found that the most used CPUs are `Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7500`\n\n```\nCPU @ 3.40GHz, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K CPU @ 4.00GHz and Intel(R) Xeon(R)\nW-2140B CPU @ 3.20GHz . The machines seem to have 1 core for the most times but the name\n\n```\nis that of a cpu with 4 or 8 cores.\n\n\nI also checked the CPU utilization rates. Hypothetically, the sandboxes would have low CPU\nutilization, since they are only meant to run the malware.\n\nCPU utiliza tion histogra m\n\n\n8\n\n6\n\n\n4\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nUtiliza tion pe rce nta ge\n\nWhile most of the sandboxes have a utilization less than 20% there are still cases where\nsandboxes have 80% or even 100%. I believe the CPU utilization cannot be a feature to\ndistingush between sandboxes and real machines.\n\n\n-----\n\nLastly for this section we look into memory. How much memory can commercial sandboxes\nspare?\n\nPhysica l m e m ory histogra m (in Gb)\n\n\n30\n\n25\n\n\n20\n\n15\n\n\n10\n\n5\n\n\n0\n\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\nMe m ory (Gb)\n\nIt appears most of the machines have 1 to 2 GB of RAM to spare. In 2 cases I found machines\n\n\nwith 512MB of memory like its 2010 . Props to the AV vendor(s) that allocated 4, 8 and\n\n16GB for a sandbox to run a malware sample.\n\n\n**Disk Partitions**\n\nAn interesting result here is that in ALL sandboxes there seems to be 1 disk partion of type\n\n\n`cdrom` . Hypothetically this may happen because during the VM creation the Windows\n\ninstallation disk was left inserted (more work needs to be done to verify this).\n\n\nFor the main disk partition (where Windows is installed) we notice quite a spectrum of sizes, but\nthe usage in general is quite low (except for the `32GB disks with high usage because`\nWindows is installed there). In 2021 I wouldn’t expect there to be many machines left with\n32GB in the main drive, so this may raise some suspicions from the attackers prespective.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Network Interfaces**\n\nIn general 2 to 3 interfaces and 5 network interfaces in 1 sandbox. The most prevalent are of\ncourse `Loopback Pseudo-Interface 1 and` `Local Area Connection . Then I noticed`\nsome pattern of `isatap.{<random GUID here>} and` `Teredo Tunneling Pseudo-`\n```\nInterface . Upon further analysis I found that these interface exist to enable IPv6\n\n```\ncommunication, so there is nothing special that an attacker can use here .\n\n\n-----\n\n**Battery**\n\nNot a single sandbox had a battery. Attackers right now pulling a high IQ strat .\n\n### Time analysis\n\nOne thing its hard to keep up to date while restoring the snapshot (at least in Windows) is local\ntime. Its a bit more difficult when you consider the geolocation the machine is supposed to be\nat. For this I collected the local time, the global UTC time and the external IP address of the\nsandbox and metadata for that IP. Thanks to `ipfy,` `just-the-time, and` `ipinfo for the`\nawesome service. The process I followed is pretty simple. I use the data from `ipinfo to get`\nthe geolocation and convert the UTC time to the local time for that geolocation, then I\ncalculated the time skew between the time of the geolocation and the sandboxes local time.\n\n**time difference(hours)** **number of machines**\n\n-19.0 1\n\n-9.0 2\n\n-8.0 1\n\n-3.0 1\n\n-2.0 18\n\n-1.0 4\n\n**0.0** **19**\n\n3.0 1\n\n5.0 1\n\n9.0 2\n\nAs it appears, around 65% of the sandboxes have some sort of a time skew (and I believe the\nother 35% are simply lucky to VPN on the same timezone or not even VPN at all, will get to this\n\nlater ).\n\nThis is a very low effort feature a real malware can use to check if its inside a sandbox given\nthat such info can be checked for free. Even through a CnC server the attacker can measure\n[whether the malware has made it into the sandboxes. Throughout our paper we also noticed](https://web.archive.org/web/20210613070852/https:/albocoder.github.io/assets/pdf_files/malw_variability.pdf)\nthat there are some real users’ machines with an outdated clock (sometimes out of date by\n\nabout 50 years ) however this made up for less than 0.001% of the machines in the real\n\nworld not 65%, so a malware author may simply choose to forgive these outdated machines\njust to be safe from analysis. And from a defender’s prespective, PLEASE UPDATE THE\nCLOCK BEFORE ROUTING THE NET TRAFFIC TO NARNIA.\n\n\n-----\n\n### IP analysis\n\n[This is the meat of the blog post, in my opinion. Thanks again to ipinfo for the 7 day free trial.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210613070852/https://ipinfo.io/)\nAs the most interesting to me, I first looked at “Who owns these IP addresses? Who are the\ncompanies/ISPs?”. As shown in the table below the network traffic in all the sandboxes is\nrouted through VPNs that they get from dedicated servers. It appears CrowdStrike has their\n\nown IP range that they use to route traffic (registered under their official name, hide the\n\npain Harold).\n\n**IP owner company** **number of IPs in the dataset**\n\nTELUS Communications Inc. 5\n\nWintek Corporation 5\n\nPJSC Vimpelcom 5\n\nVerizon Business Special Project 3\n\nLLC Digital Network 3\n\nCox Communications Inc. 3\n\nZwiebelfreunde e.V. 2\n\nBell Canada 2\n\n111250 Russia Moscow SOVINTEL/EDN 2\n\n1337 Services LLC 1\n\nVodafone D2 GmbH 1\n\nTelecom Colocation, LLC 1\n\nIPG 1\n\n111250 Russia MOscow EDN/Sovintel 1\n\nBungee Servers SP 1\n\n**CrowdStrike Services** **1**\n\nDedicated Servers 1\n\nLeaseWeb Netherlands B.V. 1\n\nARCOR AG 1\n\nDeutsche Telekom AG 1\n\nDatacamp Limited 1\n\n\n-----\n\nCore-Backbone GmbH 1\n\n\nNow we want to know where exatly are these IPs from. With this much data it’s hard to say\nwhich IPs are owned by the AV vendors, since they are also just buying VPN access, but I\nwanted to see where they are buying from. It appears Russia, US, Canada and Germany are\nthe most prominent countries, and in Russia, Moscow seems to be the city with the highest\nnumber of IPs.\n\nLoca tion of the sa ndbox IPs\n\n\nUnite d Sta te s\n\nCa na da\n\n\nRussia\n\n\nSpa in\n\n\n2.3%\nFra nce\n2.3%\n2.3%\nPhilippine s\n\n4.7%\n\nNe the rla nds\n\n\nGe rm a ny\n\n\nUnite d Kingdom\n\nIP loca tions for a ll 4 m a lwa re 's e xe cutions\n\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\nCa na da Fra nce Ge rm a ny Ne the rla nds Philippine s Russia Spa in\n\nLoca tion (Country & City)\n\n\nUnite d Kingdom Unite d Sta te s\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere is no silver bullet to detect sandboxes, but there are some features and bugs the\n\nattacker can use to detect them. On the other hand the sandboxes can also cover these\n\nweaknesses. It’s all about that arms race .\n\n\n-----",
