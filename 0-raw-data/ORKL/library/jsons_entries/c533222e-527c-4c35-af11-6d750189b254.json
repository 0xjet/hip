[BlackBerry Blog](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en.html)\n2. Unattributed RomCom Threat Actor Spoofing Popular Apps Now Hits Ukrainian\n\nMilitaries\n\n## Summary\n\nThe previously unknown RomCom RAT threat actor is now targeting Ukrainian military\ninstitutions. The same threat actor is known to deploy spoofed versions of popular software\n[\"Advanced IP Scanner.\" After being publicly exposed, it switched to another popular](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/)\n[application called \"PDF Filler.\" That indicates the group behind it is actively developing new](https://www.pdffiller.com/)\ncapabilities.\n\n## Context\n\n\n-----\n\nThe initial Advanced IP Scanner campaign occurred on July 23, 2022. Once the victim\ninstalls a Trojanized bundle, it drops RomCom RAT to the system. On October 10, 2022,\nthe threat actor improved evasion techniques by obfuscation of all strings, execution as a\nCOM object, and others.\n\n## Attack Vector\n\nEarlier versions of RomCom RAT were distributed via fake websites spoofing the legitimate\n\"Advanced IP Scanner\" application website. The Trojanized \"Advanced IP Scanner\"\npackage was hosted on \"advanced-ip-scaner[.]com\" and \"advanced-ip-scanners[.]com\"\ndomains. Both of those domains historically resolved to the same IP address of\n167[.]71[.]175[.]165. The threat actor also ensured that both fake websites looked near\nidentical to the original one - \"advanced-IP-scanner.com.\"\n\n_Figure 1 – Fake “Advanced IP Scanner” website_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 – Legitimate Advanced IP Scanner website_\n\nOn October 20th, the threat actor deployed a new campaign spoofing the \"pdfFiller\"\nwebsite, dropping a Trojanized version with RomCom RAT as the final payload.\n\n## Weaponization\n\nThe earliest versions of RomCom RAT came in the \"Advanced IP Scanner\" package. The\nBlackBerry Research and Intelligence team has identified two versions of it –\n\"Advanced_IP_Scanner_V2.5.4594.1.zip\" and \"advancedipscanner.msi.\" The threat actor\nspoofed the legitimate tools named \"Advanced_IP_Scanner_2.5.4594.1.exe\" by adding a\nsingle letter \"V\" to the file's name.\n\nOnce unpacked, it contains 27 files, of which four are malicious droppers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 – Content of Trojanized \"Advanced IP Scanner.\" RomCom RAT droppers are_\n_highlighted_\n\nDropper RomCom extracts the payload from its resources and creates it in the following\nfolder:\n\nС:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\winver.dll\n\nMain RomCom functionalities include, but are not limited to, gathering system information\n(disk and files information enumeration), and information about locally installed applications\nand memory processes. It also takes screenshots and transmits collected data to the\nhardcoded command-and-control (C2). If a special command is received, it supports autodeletion from the victim's machine.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe latest version of RomCom RAT has been bundled in the **PDFFiller.zip package.**\n\n## Connection with Attacks on Military Institutions in Ukraine.\n\nOn October 21, the threat actor behind the RomCom RAT targeted the military institutions of\nUkraine. The initial infection vector is an email with an embedded link leading to a fake\nwebsite dropping the next stage downloader. The lure is a fake document in the Ukrainian\nlanguage called \"Наказ_309.pdf\" (translated to English as \"Order_309.pdf\").\n\n_Figure 4 – The original link leads with a lure in the Ukrainian language spoofing the original_\n_Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Website_\n\nThat is an HTML file with a download URL of the next stage malicious Portable Executable\n(PE) file.\n\n_Figure 5 – Part of the HTML code from the initial \"Наказ_309.pdf\" lure_\n\nDropped malicious \"AcroRdrDCx642200120169_uk_UA.exe\" file has a valid digital\nsignature by Signer \"Blythe Consulting sp. z o.o.\".\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 – Malicious “AcroRdrDCx642200120169_uk_UA.exe” with a valid digital signature_\n\nUpon execution, it drops the following file: \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\WinApp.dll\". The\ndropped \"WinApp.dll\" file contains a single export – \"fwdTst\". By invoking the \"rundll32.exe\"\nproce3ss, the export is run. Just like previously, the RomCom RAT final payload is extracted\nfrom the resource and saved as \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\rtmpak.dll\".\n\nA legitimate clean \"pdfFiller\" application uses the same signer, \"Blythe Consulting sp. z\no.o.\". As mentioned above, the app has been abused in the latest campaigns by the\nRomCom RAT threat actor.\n\nBoth RomCom RAT droppers and the final RAT include local Russian language and\n[Russian language variants:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_dialects)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Targets\n\nBesides the latest campaign against military institutions from Ukraine, we have found the\nRomCom threat actor targeting IT companies, food brokers, and food manufacturing in the\nU.S., Brazil, and the Philippines.\n\n_Figure 7 – RomCom RAT threat actor targets_\n\n## Conclusions\n\n\n-----\n\nRomCom RAT threat actor is actively developing new techniques targeting victims\nworldwide. It's highly likely to expect new threat actor campaigns. At the time of publication,\nthere is no apparent link to any attributed threat actor.\n\nWe are releasing referential IoCs from the previous and the latest campaign targeting\nUkraine.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n\n**Hashes**\n**(sha-**\n**256)**\n\n\n3e3a7116eeadf99963077dc87680952cca87ff4fe60a552041a2def6b45cbeea\n\n983833334d168cd4274467f48171489e019b86b51e687738565a93dd3f58d0aa\n\n05681ff7cae6b28f5714628a269caa5115da49c94737ce82ec09b4312e40fd26\n\n59f0c3b7890f11217ad37764f225cd1c9d27747495d80dadde40b78edfbfa21e\n\ne80d80521238008bf6f429e072eaf6030c06e2d3123d03ea9b36f5a232a1ec90\n\n61e349518ca3f10d1e7aae0be95bc43dc23843c8acf177831cdfd48f26a07c72\n\na2511c5c2839bfbdf9c0f84f415d5eae168456e5d3f77f1becdbcd69fba4daa4\n\n56a6fb2e2b6a801351175f2aa30a63d44e9ba69f177f6fe20dad348b4d6fb0d1\n\n9f61259c966f34d89b70af92b430ae40dd5f1314ee6640d16e0b7b0f4f385738\n\nc116a0aafdc2765e38b4f5efdf89960997abf0db81daa8f5380ce3c893e9af96\n\n4fc9202ff84ef84b8c5e6140b66ac3d04570daf886a7f1ae31661ade882f963e\n\n494b43198db467f506e9857f39ebe8f8bf6d871776eba092a7e2f2140046e16d\n\n068117b406940ac510ed59efd1d7c7651f645a31bd70db6de16aba12c055aae6\n\n80d78703de91d292c031275b4493966e363f5fa065edd79e0fd63aa2573b44a4\n\n\n**C2** CombinedResidency[.]org\n\noptasko[.]com\n\n4qzm[.]com\n\nnotfiled[.]com\n\n## Applied Counter Measures\n\n\n-----\n\nimport \"pe\"\n\nimport \"math\"\n\nrule targeted_RomComRat : RomCom deployed via trojanized legitimate apps\n\n{\nmeta:\n\ndescription = \"Rule detecting RomCom RAT used to attack Military Institutions from\nUkraine\"\n\nauthor = \" The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence team\"\n\ndate = \"2022-18-10\"\n\nlicense = \"This Yara rule is provided under the Apache License 2.0\n(https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and open to any user or organization, as\nlong as you use it under this license and ensure originator credit in any derivative to the\nBlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team\"\n\nhash =\n\"9f61259c966f34d89b70af92b430ae40dd5f1314ee6640d16e0b7b0f4f385738\"\n\nstrings:\n\n//comDll.dll\n\n$x0 = {636f6d446c6c2e646c6c}\n\n//combase32.dll\n\n$x1 = {63006f006d006200610073006500330032002e0064006c006c00}\n\ncondition:\n\nuint16(0) == 0x5a4d and\n\npe.number_of_sections == 7 and\n\npe.sections[0].name == \".text\" and\n\nmath.entropy(pe.sections[0].raw_data_offset, pe.sections[0].raw_data_size) >= 6.5\nand\n\npe.sections[1].name == \".rdata\" and\n\nmath.entropy(pe.sections[1].raw_data_offset, pe.sections[1].raw_data_size) >= 5.2\nand\n\npe.sections[2].name == \".data\" and\n\npe.sections[3].name == \".pdata\" and\n\nmath.entropy(pe.sections[3].raw_data_offset, pe.sections[3].raw_data_size) >= 5.5\nand\n\npe.sections[4].name == \"_RDATA\" and\n\nmath.entropy(pe.sections[4].raw_data_offset, pe.sections[4].raw_data_size) >= 2.4\nand\n\npe.sections[5].name == \".rsrc\" and\n\nmath.entropy(pe.sections[5].raw_data_offset, pe.sections[5].raw_data_size) >= 2.85\nand\n\npe.sections[6].name == \".reloc\" and\n\nmath.entropy(pe.sections[6].raw_data_offset, pe.sections[6].raw_data_size) >= 5.3\nand\n\npe.number_of_resources == 2 and\n\npe.exports(\"startFile\") and\n\npe.exports(\"startInet\") and\n\nall of ($x*)\n\n}\n\n\n-----\n\n## About The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team\n\nThe BlackBerry Research & Intelligence team examines emerging and persistent threats,\nproviding intelligence analysis for the benefit of defenders and the organizations they serve.\n\nBack\n\n\n-----",
