The company suspected of being invaded by hackers. It has urgently repaired most\nof it and is expected to return to normal today,\"\n\n\"Lu Qingxiong emphasized that Compal is not being blackmailed by hackers, as is reported\n[by the outside world, and everything is currently normal in production,\" UDN reported.](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/5000933)\n\nSince then, BleepingComputer has confirmed that Compal suffered a DoppelPaymer\nransomware attack after we obtained a ransom note used in the attack.\n\n**Compal ransom note**\n[DoppelPaymer is a ransomware operation known for attacking enterprise targets by gaining](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/doppelpaymer/)\naccess to admin credentials and using them to spread throughout a Windows network.\nOnce they gain access to a Windows domain controller, they deploy the ransomware\npayloads to all devices on the network.\n\nAccording to the DoppelPaymer Tor payment site linked to in the ransom note, the\nransomware gang is demanding 1,100 Bitcoins, or $16,725,500.00 at today's prices, to\nreceive a decryptor.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DoppelPaymer ransom demand**\n[According to the ransom note and DoppelPaymer's past history, the attackers likely stole](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-launches-site-to-post-victims-data/)\nunencrypted data as part of their attack.\n\nThis stolen data is then used as a double-extortion strategy where the ransomware gangs\n[threaten to release the files on data leak sites if a ransom is not paid.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/list-of-ransomware-that-leaks-victims-stolen-files-if-not-paid/)\n\nIt should be noted that the initial ransom demands are a \"starting\" price and are commonly\nnegotiated to a significantly lower amount for victims who decide to pay the ransom.\n\nOther victims attacked by DoppelPaymer in the past include PEMEX (Petróleos\nMexicanos), the [City of Torrance in California, Newcastle University,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-hits-los-angeles-county-city-leaks-files/) [Hall County in Georgia,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/georgia-county-voter-information-leaked-by-ransomware-gang/)\n[and Bretagne Télécom.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-hacked-bretagne-t-l-com-using-the-citrix-adc-flaw/)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[Compal](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/compal/)\n[DoppelPaymer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/doppelpaymer/)\n[Laptop](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/laptop/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
