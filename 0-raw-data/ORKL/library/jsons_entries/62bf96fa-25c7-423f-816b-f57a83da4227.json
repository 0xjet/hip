One of them is Oil India.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ib-central-cyber-security-agencies-to-probe-ransomware-attack-on-oil-india/articleshow/90865903.cms)\n\n[Security researcher MalwareHunterTeam in January, a couple of weeks after 14 alleged](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\nmembers of the gang were arrested in Russia, said that starting mid-December last year\nthey noticed activity from a a different ransomware gang (Ransom Cartel) that was related\nto REvil's encryptor, although no connection was evident.\n\n_source:_\n\n_[MalwareHunterTeam](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1484530363162583042)_\n\n\n-----\n\n[The researcher later observed the current REvil-related leak site being up between April 5](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1516754023038214152)\nand April 10 but with no content and it started to be populated about a week after.\n\nAnother observation from MalwareHunterTeam is that the source for the RSS feed shows\nthe string Corp Leaks, which has been used by the now-defunct Nefilim ransomware gang\n\n[[1,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-august-7th-2020-businesses-under-siege/) [2].](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-october-16th-2020-the-weekend-is-upon-us/)\n\n_source:_\n\n_BleepingComputer_\nThe blog and payment sites are up and running on different servers. Looking at the\nformer, BleepingComputer noticed that the new ransomware operation's blog drops a\ncookie named DEADBEEF, a computer term that was used as a filemarker by\nthe [TeslaCrypt ransomware gang.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/teslacrypt-shuts-down-and-releases-master-decryption-key/)\n\n_source: BleepingComputer_\nA connection to a ransomware threat actor is not possible at this time as samples of the\nnew REvil-based payload have to be analyzed and whoever is behind the new leak site has\nnot claimed any name or affiliation, yet.\n\nWhile under control of the FBI in November 2021, REvil’s data leak and payment sites\nshowed a page titled “REvil is bad” and a login form, initially via TOR gateways and at the\n.Onion location.\n\n\n-----\n\nsource: _[Lawrence Abrams](https://twitter.com/LawrenceAbrams/status/1458228560401944580)_\nThe mystery of the redirects, both recent and from last year, deepens, as this suggests that\nsomeone other than law enforcement, has access to the TOR private keys that allowed\nthem to make changes for the .Onion site.\n\nOn a popular Russian-speaking hacker forum, users are speculating between the new\noperation being a scam, a honeypot, or a legit continuation of the old REvil business that\nlost its reputation and has a lot to do to earn it back.\n\nThere are multiple ransomware operations that either use patched REvil encryptors or are\nimpersonating the original group.\n\nThese include LV, which was using REvil's encryptor before law enforcement shut them\ndown and Ransom Cartel, which appears to be connected to REvil but the link is unclear.\n\n## REvil's fall\n\n\n-----\n\nREvil ransomware had a long run that started in April 2019 as a continuation of the\nGandCrab operation, the first that established the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model.\n\n[In August 2019 the gang hit multiple local administrations in Texas and demanded a](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-want-25-million-ransom-for-texas-ransomware-attacks/)\ncollective ransom of $2.5 million - the highest at that time.\n\n[The group is responsible for the Kaseya supply-chain attack that affected about 1,500](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kaseya-roughly-1-500-businesses-hit-by-revil-ransomware-attack/)\nbusinesses and also led to their demise last year as law enforcement around the world\nintensified their collaboration to bring the gang down.\n\nSoon after hitting Kaseya, the gang took a two-month break not knowing that law\nenforcement agencies had breached their servers. When REvil restarted the operation, they\nrestored systems from backups, oblivious of the compromise.\n\nIn mid-January, [Russia announced that it shut down REvil after identifying all members of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russia-arrests-revil-ransomware-gang-members-seize-66-million/)\nthe gang and arresting 14 individuals.\n\n_“As a result of the joint actions of the FSB and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, the_\n_organized criminal community ceased to exist, the information infrastructure used for_\n_criminal purposes was neutralized” Russia’s Federal Security Service_\n\nIn an [interview with Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of](https://rg.ru/2022/04/07/sovbez-rf-soedinennye-shtaty-v-ocherednoj-raz-dokazali-chto-im-verit-nelzia.html)\nthe Russian Federation, Oleg Khramov, said that the Russian law enforcement agency\nstarted its investigation into REvil from the name Puzyrevsky and an IP address transmitted\nby the United States as belonging to the group’s main hacker.\n\nAt the moment, the U.S. has stopped collaborating with Russia on cybersecurity threats\n\n- attacks on critical infrastructure in particular, as a direct result of Russia invading Ukraine.\n\n**Update (April 21): Article updated to make it clear that the ransomware gang redirecting**\nfrom the original REvil leak site to the new one appears to be different from other groups\nthat used a patched REvil payload in the past, and that the redirect was observed on April\n20.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n[REvil ransomware returns: New malware sample confirms gang is back](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-returns-new-malware-sample-confirms-gang-is-back/)\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Leak Site](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/leak-site/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[REvil](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/revil/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
