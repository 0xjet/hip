According\nto the researcher, whose discovery was later confirmed by an Intezer code similarity\n[analysis, the new (Satan) DBGer ransomware now also incorporates Mimikatz, an open-](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)\nsource password-dumping utility.\n\nThe purpose of DBGer incorporating Mimikatz is for lateral movement inside compromised\nnetworks. This fits a recently observed trend in Satan's modus operandi.\n\n## History of Satan ransomware\n\n[The Satan ransomware launched in January 2017 as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-satan-ransomware-available-through-a-ransomware-as-a-service-/)\nportal, allowing anyone to register and create custom versions of the Satan ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFirst versions were unsophisticated, as most new ransomware variants tend to be. For a\nlong time, the Satan crew rented its ransomware to other crooks, who then distributed it to\nvictims, mostly via email spam (malspam) campaigns.\n\nWith time, the ransomware gained a lot of reputation and clients on the criminal\nunderground. The group behind the LockCrypt ransomware started as Satan RaaS\ncustomers before developing their own strain. Further, other ransomware devs took\n[inspiration from the Satan code, such as the Iron ransomware group.](https://bartblaze.blogspot.com/2018/04/maktub-ransomware-possibly-rebranded-as.html)\n\n## Satan devs learn from the WannaCry outbreak\n\nBut the Satan crew didn't stand idly either. As the ransomware scene evolved in 2017, they\nevolved as well.\n\nChanges in the ransomware scene of 2017 included self-spreading mechanisms (seen in\nthe three ransomware outbreaks of last year) and a move to infecting larger networks\ninstead of home users (because of larger payouts and payout rate).\n\nAround November 2017, Satan devs started their plans of updating the ransomware to\nbetter fit these trends.\n\n[The first step they took was to incorporate a version of the EternalBlue SMB exploit. The](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue)\naddition of this exploit meant that after Satan infected a computer, the ransomware would\nuse EternalBlue to scan the local network for computers with outdated SMB services and\ninfect them as well, maximizing an attack's impact.\n\nThis mechanism has been previously analyzed by security researcher Bart Parys in a blog\npost [here.](https://bartblaze.blogspot.com/2018/04/satan-ransomware-adds-eternalblue.html)\n\nOther ransomware strains that used EternalBlue included WannaCry, NotPetya, and [UIWIX,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uiwix-ransomware-using-eternalblue-smb-exploit-to-infect-victims/)\nand all used it in a similar way.\n\n## Satan ransomware also adds exploits\n\n\n-----\n\nThis focus on bolstering a lateral movement system continued in 2018, as the ransomware\nreceived another update to its lateral movement mechanism at the start of May.\n\n[AlienVault experts noticed that new versions of Satan would also scan local networks and](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/labs-research/satan-ransomware-spawns-new-methods-to-spread)\nattempt to infect other computers using one of the below exploits/methods:\n\nJBoss CVE-2017-12149\nWeblogic CVE-2017-10271\nTomcat web application brute forcing\n\n## DBGer adds Mimikatz\n\nThe new (Satan) DBGer ransomware strain continues this focus on lateral movement. The\nnew version spotted today works by dropping Mimikatz, dumping passwords for networked\ncomputers, and using these credentials to access and infect those devices as well.\n\nThe development path we see taken by the Satan/DBGer crew is what we can expect in the\ncoming months from most ransomware strains.\n\nCybercrime gangs have understood by now that there is more money to be made from coinmining campaigns rather than ransomware. The groups who are still active on the\nransomware scene will need to improve their code to maximize profits and adding selfspreading and lateral movement mechanisms is the simplest way to do that.\n\nThis is because self-spreading and lateral movement features in ransomware allow a crook\nthe opportunity to infect and receive multiple ransom payments just by fooling one absentminded employee to open a boobytrapped file.\n\n### IOCs:\n\n**Sha256: 1f3509cc11ffa1f7d839df93615cf1ba0819d75cafd5ef59110d9b01fb90addd**\n\n**Modification to file extensions:**\n\nimage.png -- > [dbger@protonmail.com]image.png.dbger\n\n**Ransom note:**\n\n__How_to_decrypt_files.txt_\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nSome files have been encrypted\nPlease send ( 1 ) bitcoins to my wallet address\nIf you paid, send the machine code to my email\nI will give you the key\nIf there is no payment within three days,\nwe will no longer support decryption\nIf you exceed the payment time, your data will be open to the public download\nWe support decrypting the test file.\nSend three small than 3 MB files to the email address\nBTC Wallet : [redacted]\nEmail: dbger@protonmail.com\nYour HardwareID:\n\n```\n[DBGer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/dbger/)\n[ETERNALBLUE](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/eternalblue/)\n[Mimikatz](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/mimikatz/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Satan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/satan/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a\nfew more.
