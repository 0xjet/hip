While the actors are infecting victims with\nCrimsonRAT, their well-known malware of choice, they are also using new stagers and\nimplants.\nThis campaign, which has been ongoing since at least June 2021, uses fake domains\nmimicking legitimate government and related organizations to deliver malicious\npayloads, a common Transparent tribe tactic.\nBased on our analysis of Transparent Tribe operations over the last year, the group has\ncontinued to change its initial entry mechanisms and incorporate new bespoke\nmalware, indicating the actors are actively diversifying their portfolio to compromise\neven more victims.\nNotably, the adversary has moved towards deploying small, bespoke stagers and\ndownloaders that can be easily modified, likely to enable quick and agile operations.\n\n## Transparent Tribe deploys new implants\n\n[Transparent Tribe, also known as APT36 and Mythic Leopard, continues to create fake](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/05/transparent-tribe-infra-and-targeting.html)\ndomains mimicking legitimate military and defense organizations as a core component of\ntheir operations In the latest campaign conducted by the threat actor Cisco Talos observed\n\n\n-----\n\nmultiple delivery methods, such as executables masquerading as installers of legitimate\napplications, archive files and maldocs to target Indian entities and individuals. These\ninfection chains led to the deployment of three different types of implants, two of which we\nhad not previously observed:\n\nCrimsonRAT: A remote access trojan (RAT) family that Transparent Tribe frequently\nuses to conduct espionage operations against their targets.\nA previously unknown Python-based stager that leads to the deployment of .NET-based\nreconnaissance tools and RATs.\nA lightweight .NET-based implant to run arbitrary code on the infected system.\n\nThis campaign also uses fake domains mimicking legitimate government and pseudogovernment organizations to deliver malicious payloads, a typical Transparent Tribe tactic.\n\n## Threat actor profile\n\nTransparent Tribe is a suspected Pakistan-linked threat actor. This group targets individuals\nand entities associated with governments and military personnel in the Indian subcontinent,\nspecifically Afghanistan and India. Transparent Tribe has also been known to use their\nCrimsonRAT implant against [human rights activists in Pakistan.](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa33/8366/2018/en/)\n\nThe group primarily uses three Windows-based malware families to carry out espionage\nactivities against their targets.\n\n**CrimsonRAT is a .NET-based implant that has been the group's malware of choice**\n[since at least 2020 . Transparent Tribe's multiple campaigns leveraging CrimsonRAT](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.crimson)\nover the years indicate a steady evolution in the implant's capabilities.\n**[ObliqueRAT is a C/C++-based implant discovered by Talos in early 2020.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/02/obliquerat-hits-victims-via-maldocs.html)**\nObliqueRAT is primarily reserved for highly targeted attacks on government personnel\nand in operations where stealth is a prime focus of the attackers' infection chain. This\n[implant has also seen a constant evolution in deployment tactics and malicious](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/02/obliquerat-new-campaign.html)\nfunctionalities over time.\n**Custom malware used by Transparent Tribe consists of easily and quickly deployable**\ndownloaders, droppers and lightweight RATs containing limited capabilities as\nopposed to CrimsonRAT and ObliqueRAT.\n\nTransparent Tribe also maintains a suite of mobile implants in their arsenal. Implants such\nas [CapraRAT are constantly modified to be deployed against targets. These implants contain](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/a/investigating-apt36-or-earth-karkaddans-attack-chain-and-malware.html)\na plethora of malicious capabilities meant to steal data from mobile devices.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Downloader executables\n\nTalos observed the use of downloader executables containing different lures related to the\nIndian government. Themes included topics related to COVID-19, resumes and installers for\ngovernment applications, such as the Kavach multi-factor authentication (MFA) application.\n\n### Latest variant\n\nThe latest downloaders primarily masquerade as installers for Kavach and are distributed for\ndelivering malicious artifacts to targets. Kavach is widely used by government personnel, as it\nallows employees (including military personnel) to access the Indian government's I.T.\nresources, such as email services.\n\nThe droppers are .NET-based executables. They begin execution by checking if the timezone\non the infected endpoint contains keywords such as \"India.\" A splash screen is displayed to\nthe victim notifying them that the Kavach application is being installed:\n\nFake installation splash screen\n\nThe downloaders will then reach out to a malicious website, masquerading as a legitimate\nIndian government or pseudo-government entity, to download a malicious payload that is\nthen activated on the endpoint.\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, download a legitimate copy of the Kavach application s MSI installer from yet another\nattacker-controlled website and execute it to make the whole attack chain appear legitimate.\n\nDownloader fetching and executing malicious payload and legitimate installer for Kavach.\n\n### Additional variant\n\nAnother variation of the initial infection vector used in the campaign is a notably large\ndownloader binary (141MB) that contains the entire legitimate installer (MSI) for the Kavach\napplication in its resources. The zipped copy of the MSI is extracted from the downloader's\nresources and executed on the system as a decoy to appear legitimate to the targets. The\nactual implant is then downloaded from a remote location, AES-decrypted using a hardcoded\nkey, written to disk and executed on the infected endpoint.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second variant of the downloader downloads and decrypts the payload from a remote\nlocation.\n\n### A timeline of older variants\n\nAs early as June 2021, the attackers primarily used malicious documents (maldocs) as an\ninitial infection vector to deliver the malicious downloaders. This vector consisted of a\nmalicious macro that would download and activate the downloader on the infected endpoint.\nThis practice continued into July 2021.\n\nHowever, beginning with June 2021, there was also a steady evolution in the distribution\ntactics used in this campaign. Around this time, we began observing the use of nontraditional initial entry mechanisms throughout the course of this campaign, suggesting a\nclear intention of aggressively infecting targets for espionage.\n\nFor instance, in June 2021, the attackers used IMG files for distribution, containing multiple\ninfection artifacts — all COVID-19 themed — to trick targets into getting infected. Wrapping\nmalware in IMG files is a tactic gaining traction with crimeware operators and APTs as a way\nto deliver malware to victims since newer versions of the Windows OS natively support IMG\nfiles.\n\nMalicious IMG distributed by Transparent Tribe.\n\nThe malicious image consists of four files:\n\nMalicious Python-based stager.\nDecoy PDF document containing a COVID-19-themed lure.\nVBS file for executing the stager and displaying the decoy.\nMalicious LNK file for activating the VBS on the endpoint.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nIn September 2021, the actors switched up their initial infection artifact and used VHDX files\n[delivering the malicious droppers. VHDX files do not retainMark Of the Web (MOTW)](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/the-dangers-of-vhd-and-vhdx-files/)\nstamps and thus artifacts such as maldocs, delivered through these wrappers aren't identified\nas originating from the internet by Microsoft utilities such as Word, Excel etc. - allowing the\nattackers to run malicious code on the endpoint without any Microsoft warnings.\n\n[The variant of the downloaders used here, previously disclosed by Cyble, masqueraded as an](https://blog.cyble.com/2021/09/14/apt-group-targets-indian-defense-officials-through-enhanced-ttps/)\n[app from the Canteen Stores Department (CSD) of the Government of India. On execution,](http://csdindia.gov.in/)\nthis variant would open the legitimate website for CSD on the target's system. However, as\nseen previously with Transparent Tribe, the threat actors continued the development of\nsimilar infection chains consisting of various themes to distribute their malware without\nregard for any previous public disclosures.\n\nThe threat actor then introduced the use of RAR archives to distribute malicious malware in\nNovember 2021. The RAR archive consisted of the downloader, this time downloading a\nhighly specific decoy PDF containing the work history of an Indian government official. The\nRAR archives are typically password-protected and hosted on public media sharing websites.\nTherefore, it is highly likely that Transparent Tribe used spearphishing emails to deliver\ndownload URLs for the archives to their targets via emails containing the passwords for the\narchives.\n\nTimeline of evolution of entry vectors:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Implant analyses\n\n### CrimsonRAT\n\nCrimsonRAT is a popular malware RAT implant that consists of a wide variety of capabilities.\nIt is the staple implant of choice for Transparent Tribe to establish long-term access into\nvictim networks. This RAT is actively worked upon and has seen considerable updates over\nthe years in not just the development of new capabilities, but also to obfuscate the implant by\nthe APT group.\n\nThe latest version of CrimsonRAT seen in this campaign in January and February 2022\ncontains a number of capabilities, including:\n\nList files and folders in a directory path specified by the C2.\nRun specific processes on the endpoint — keylogger and USB modules.\nList process IDs and names running on the endpoint.\nGet information such as name, creation times and size of image files (pictures such as\nBMP, JPG etc.) specified by the C2.\nTake screenshots of the current screen and send it to C2.\nUpload keylogger logs from a file on disk to the C2.\n\n\n-----\n\nSend system information to C2 including:\n\nComputername, username, Operating System name, filepath of implant, parent\nfolder path.\nIndicator of whether the keylogger module is in the endpoint and running and its\nversion.\nIndicator of whether the USB module is in the endpoint and running and its\nversion.\n\nRun arbitrary commands on the system.\nWrite data sent by C2 to a file on disk.\nRead contents of a file on disk and exfiltrate to C2.\nList all drives on the system.\nList all files in a directory.\nDownload the USB worm and keylogger modules from the C2 and write them to disk.\nSend a file's name, creation time and size to the C2- file path is specified by the C2.\nDelete files specified by the C2 from the endpoint.\nGet names, creation times and size of all files containing the file extension specified by\nthe C2.\n\n\n-----\n\nCode Snippet: CrimsonRAT command handler.\n\nSeen in:\n\n**Jan-Feb 2022: Deployed by Kavach-themed downloaders.**\n\n### Lightweight implant\n\nA new lightweight, .NET-based implant was also seen in this campaign in several infection\nchains. This implant has limited capabilities when compared to CrimsonRAT but contains\nenough functionality to control and monitor the infected system. Capabilities include:\n\nList all running processes on the endpoint.\nDownload and execute a file from the C2.\nDownload and execute a file specified by the C2 from another remote location.\n\n\n-----\n\nClose connection with the C2 until the next run.\nGather system information from the endpoint such as Computer Name, username,\npublic and local IPs, Operating system name, list of runnings AVs, device type (desktop\nor laptop).\n\nThe implant also persists via an InternetShortcut in the current user's Startup directory.\n\nImplant downloading and executing a file from a remote location.\n\nSeen in:\n\n**Jan-Feb 2022: Deployed by Kavach-themed downloaders.**\n**November 2021: Seen in infection chains using RAR archives hosted on CMS.**\n**September 2021: Deployed by CSD-themed downloaders.**\n\n### Python-based stagers\n\nWe've also observed the use of Python-based stagers throughout this campaign. These\nstagers are pyinstaller-based EXEs and consist of the following functionalities:\n\nCollect system information from the endpoint consisting of all running process names,\ncomputername and OS name and send it to a remote C2 URL.\nDrops one of two embedded files: A malicious DLL used to activate a recon tool in the\ncurrent user's Startup folder based on whether the endpoint is Windows 7 or not.\nParse responses from the C2 to obtain data that is then written to a file to disk.\n\nAll the relevant information used in the functioning of the stager is kept in a separate Python\nfile.\n\n\n-----\n\nStager configuration information.\n\nSeen in:\n\n**June 2021: Maldocs.**\n**June 2021: IMG files.**\n\n**Embedded implant**\n\nThe embedded implants deployed by the python based stager will simply activate a malicious\nDLL existing on disk by loading and running it in the embedded implant's process. The DLL\nloaded is the actual malicious reconnaissance tool used by the attackers.\n\n**Recon tool**\n\nThe DLL implant will first send a beacon to the C2 server URL to indicate that it has been\nsuccessfully deployed. The C2 server must reply with a specific keyword such as\n\"onlyparanoidsurvive\" for the implant to start accepting commands from another C2 URL.\nThe implant will first send a list of all files in the current user's Cookie directory to the C2. In\nresponse, the C2 may send the \"senddevices\" command to the implant. If this command is\nreceived, the implant will send the following data to a third C2 URL:\n\nOS Caption from CIM_OperatingSystem.\nAll local IP addresses of the infected endpoint.\nDevice type — desktop or laptop.\nProduct version of the executable in which the DLL has been loaded.\n\n\n-----\n\nImplant gathering system information for exfiltration to the C2.\n\nThe implant will then proceed to get executables from the remote C2 server that are then\nexecuted on the infected endpoint.\n\n\n-----\n\nHelper DLL used to execute binaries on the endpoint.\n\n## Targeting and attribution\n\nThis campaign saw the use of multiple types of lures and decoys to target Indian government\npersonnel. This is a targeting tactic typical of groups operating under the Pakistani nexus of\n[APT groups, such as Transparent Tribe and SideCopy.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/07/sidecopy.html)\n\nFor example, in July 2021, we saw the attackers use themes related to the 7th Indian Central\nPay Commission (7th CPC) for government employees in maldocs to deliver the Pythonbased stager that deployed malware on the infected endpoints. Transparent Tribe will\nfrequently use the 7th CPC as a topic of interest to trick victims into opening maldocs and\ninfecting themselves.\n\n\n-----\n\nMaldoc with 7th CPC themes.\n\nWe also saw the use of COVID-themed lures and decoys containing advisories primarily\ntargeting employees of the government of India. This is another tactic that the Transparent\n[Tribe has utilized in past operations.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/05/transparent-tribe-infra-and-targeting.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nCOVID-19-themed decoy used against government employees.\n\nOver the past year, we have observed this threat actor heavily utilize women's resumes to\ntarget individuals of interest. This is inline with their tactic of honey trapping targets by using\nsuch malicious resumes and executables that display alluring pictures. This campaign,\nhowever, used a similar yet distinct theme. Instead of resumes, we observed the use of a\n[decoy document in November 2021 that detailed a male Indian Ministry of Defence (MoD)](https://www.mod.gov.in/)\nemployee's work experience.\n\n\n-----\n\nService history of an MoD official used as a lure/decoy.\n\nAnother TTP used by Transparent Tribe in their operations is the cloning of legitimate\nwebsites into fake ones owned and operated by the attackers. These fake websites are used\nalong with typo-squatted or similarly spelled domains to appear legitimate but serve\nmalicious artifacts as part of the attackers' infection chains. One such example in this\ncampaign is the malicious domain dsoi[.]info. This domain is a direct copy of the legitimate\n[website of the Defence Service Officers' Institute (DSOI) of India, created by cloning content](https://dsoi.org.in/)\nusing HTTrack, a free website copier program.\n\nWe've seen this tactic (cloning legitimate websites using HTTrack) used by Transparent Tribe\n[in the past to deliver ObliqueRAT malware payloads around mid-2021.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/05/transparent-tribe-infra-and-targeting.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nTransparent Tribe commonly uses malicious artifacts against Indian targets, masquerading\nas legitimate applications maintained by the government of India. In September 2021, Talos\n[disclosed Operation Armor Piercer, which consisted of the use of themes pertaining to the](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/09/operation-armor-piercer.html)\nKavach MFA application to spread commodity RATs. The SideCopy APT group also uses\n[trojans such as MargulasRAT pretending to be a VPN application for India's National](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/07/sidecopy.html)\nInformatics Centre (NIC). This new campaign from Transparent Tribe also saw fake\ninstallers for the Kavach application being used to deploy CrimsonRAT and other malware.\n\nThe use of CrimsonRAT in operations such as these is expected of Transparent Tribe. It has\nbeen seen in the wild for years and is the tool of choice for the threat actors in campaigns that\ncast a relatively wide net for targeting their victims. This is unlike ObliqueRAT, which is used\nin highly targeted operations by Transparent Tribe.\n\nThe use of new bespoke malware in addition to the RATs indicates the group is diversifying\ntheir malware portfolio to achieve an even greater degree of success. In another common\ntrend, we have also observed Transparent Tribe quickly develop and deploy bespoke, small\nand lightweight stagers and downloaders that can be modified with relative ease (and\ndiscarded if needed), leading to the deployment of their actual implants meant to provide\nlong term access into their targets' networks and systems.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTransparent Tribe has been a highly active APT group in the Indian subcontinent. Their\nprimary targets have been government and military personnel in Afghanistan and India. This\ncampaign furthers this targeting and their central goal of establishing long term access for\nespionage. The use of multiple types of delivery vehicles and file formats indicates that the\ngroup is aggressively trying to infect their targets with their implants such as CrimsonRAT.\nThey have continued the use of fake domains masquerading as government and quasigovernment entities, as well as the use of generically themed content-hosting domains to\nhost malware. Although not very sophisticated, this is an extremely motivated and persistent\nadversary that constantly evolves tactics to infect their targets.\n\nOrganizations should remain vigilant against such threats, as they are likely to proliferate in\nthe future. In-depth defense strategies based on a risk analysis approach can deliver the best\nresults in the prevention. However, this should always be complemented by a good incident\nresponse plan which has been not only tested with tabletop exercises and reviewed and\nimproved every time it's put to the test on real engagements.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
