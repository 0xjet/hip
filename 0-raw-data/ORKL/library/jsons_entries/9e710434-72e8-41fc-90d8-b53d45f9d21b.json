Cybercriminals are not bias and will exploit any and\neverything they can to reap ill-gained profits. While to some people the Olympic Games are just another sports\nevent, for many others it is a culture. Die-hard fans like to get an early jump on buying tickets, especially top\ncategory events that often sell-out.\n\nEmail scams that spoof or exploit official Olympic sites and promotions are nothing new. In fact, Internet security\nexperts who keep watch of malware activity in the wild reported a 2012 London Olympic Game email spam\nsurfacing as early as October, 2008.\n\nThe email spam delivering Bkdr_Cysxl.A presents as follows:\n\n_Don't be fooled by bogus websites and organisations claiming to sell tickets to the Games. Tickets will be available_\n_from this website, for the UK and EEA (European Economic Area) residents only, and official 2012 London sales_\n_channel from spring 2011. You will not be asked to make a payment or sign a contract until then._\n\nPlease read about tickets for details at the attachment in which has some bogus websites and organizations.\n\nAn official site of the London 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.\n\nThe above spam letter is sealed with a fraudulent 2012 Olympic Games logo, in which cybercriminals hopes\nauthenticates the farce and scam to further deceive unwary PC users. Is it ironic that the first line in the bogus email\nletter mirrors actual verbiage posted on one of the official ticket selling sites for the 2012 London Olympic and\nParalympic Games? No, it is not mere coincidence. Malware makers and cybercriminals often shape their viral\nwarheads off of legitimate branding, even violating copyrights.\n\nIn order to execute the payload, PC users must open the infectious .DOC attachment containing 3 supposed bogus\n[websites. If opened, however, a malicious file being detected as TROJ_ARTIEF.ZIGS exploits a RTF stack buffer](https://www.enigmasoftware.com/trojartiefzigs-removal/)\noverflow and unleashes or downloads Bkdr_Cysxl.A onto the infected system.\n\nIn addition to opening a backdoor for a hacker to gain access and possible administrative control, Bkdr_Cysxl.A will\nreconfigure the system. Files and components might be deleted to render the firewall, weaker anti-virus programs\ndefenseless and to cripple the operating system, helping to justify the lies and behaviors of a fake online scanner or\nrogue security program. A port will be opened to report successful infiltration and implantation of malicious files and\ncomponents, earning pay for the malware builder. Vital data will be stolen off the system and more malicious\nprograms might be installed.\n\nHopefully you did not fall for the scam and deleted the spam letter altogether as opposed to opening the malicious\ndocument. If you or someone using your PC have fallen victim, you should clean your computer by using a trusted\nanti-malware program to scan and eradicate all found malware, even ones hidden in the root of your PC. Before\nbuying tickets online, make sure the website or ticket promoter is legitimate and you are not just handing your\nfinancial data over to a hacker.\n\n## Technical Information\n\n### Screenshots & Other Imagery\n\n\n-----\n\n**SpyHunter Detects & Remove BKDR_CYSXL.A**\n\n### File System Details\n\n**#** **File Name** **MD5**\n\n1 %System\nRoot%\\Document\nand Settings\\All\nusers\\realupdate.exe\n\nName: %System Root%\\Document\nand Settings\\All users\\realupdate.exe\nType: Executable File\nGroup: Malware file\n\n\n**Detection**\n**Count**\n\nN/A\n\n\n2 %System%\\cydll.dll N/A\n\nName: %System%\\cydll.dll\nType: Dynamic link library\nGroup: Malware file\n\n3 file.exe 14b6fcdff12b707bf660d552b2e24731 0\n\n\n-----\n\nName: file.exe\nMD5:\n14b6fcdff12b707bf660d552b2e24731\nSize: 73.48 KB (73483 bytes)\nDetection Count: 0\nType: Executable File\nGroup: Malware file\nLast Updated: May 4, 2012\n\n4 file.dll c10ae223f80a4aab03da384e4c89a39d 0\n\nName: file.dll\nMD5:\nc10ae223f80a4aab03da384e4c89a39d\nSize: 54.27 KB (54272 bytes)\nDetection Count: 0\nType: Dynamic link library\nGroup: Malware file\nLast Updated: May 4, 2012\n\n### Registry Details\n\nBKDR_CYSXL.A creates the following registry entry or registry entries:\nRegistry key\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Sxl\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\CyService\\parametersServiceDll =\n\"%System%\\cydll.dll\"\n\n## Site Disclaimer\n\n**Enigmasoftware.com is not associated, affiliated, sponsored or owned by the malware creators or**\n**distributors mentioned on this article.
