Since its inception, Ryuk has been used to target large organizations to great\n[effect, having accumulated as much as $61.26 million (as of Feb 2020) in ransom payments](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-says-140-million-paid-to-ransomware-offers-defense-tips/)\naccording to federal investigations.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the reasons behind Ryuk s unfortunate success is the threat actor s capacity to\nevolve their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). Since early last year, the TrickBot\n[information stealer trojan has been a more or less constant partner-in-crime, with many](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/01/a-nasty-trick-from-credential-theft-malware-to-business-disruption.html)\ncampaigns also including other malware, frameworks and tools. The mentioned campaign\n[utilized the EMPIRE framework, and in later campaigns the same year Cybereason](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire)\n[observed Emotet downloading TrickBot deploying Ryuk.](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/triple-threat-emotet-deploys-trickbot-to-steal-data-spread-ryuk-ransomware)\n\nIn March of 2020, the threat actors temporarily stopped deploying Ryuk, and a new\nransomware called Conti was introduced. Researchers found that the code bases were\n[similar, implying this could be the successor to Ryuk. However, in September 2020 Ryuk](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-shows-signs-of-being-ryuks-successor/)\nmade a swift return, and with Conti infections still happening alongside it, the evidence\npointed to Conti not being a successor so much as a new, different strain of malware.\n\n[Shortly after the start of Ryuk’s hiatus, a new malware called BazarLoader was observed](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/a-bazar-of-tricks-following-team9s-development-cycles)\nbeing delivered by TrickBot. Currently, evidence suggests that Ryuk, Conti and BazarLoader\nare [used by the same threat actor.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/wizard-spider-adversary-update/)\n\nRyuk ransomware is most often seen as the final payload in a larger targeted attack against\na corporation, and since its return in September, it has been mainly via TrickBot or\nBazarLoader infections.\n\n## Cybereason Detects and Blocks Ryuk Ransomware\n\nCybereason detects the various execution phases of Ryuk in detail, including process\ninjection, persistence creation and shadow copy deletion as detailed below in the Execution\n_Overview section. With the proper settings applied to sensors in the customer environment,_\nCybereason can stop the Ryuk ransomware before it encrypts user files.\n\nWith Anti-Ransomware mode enabled, the Ryuk execution is stopped before encrypting the\nhard drive. A ransom note can be found in folders where the malware attempted to encrypt\nfiles, but the user’s files were saved. If Anti-Malware is enabled the sample will be removed\nbefore execution. The following video provides a quick demonstration of Cybereason’s\ndetection and prevention capabilities against Ryuk ransomware:\n\n### Execution Overview\n\n\n-----\n\n_Ryuk ransomware execution as detected by the Cybereason sensor_\n\nOnce the Ryuk binary is executed, the sample creates a copy of itself (the randomly named\nchild process of Ryuk in the screenshot below is a copy of Ryuk - ltbyhrc.exe) to execute\nwith argument “8 LAN”. This function uses the device’s ARP table to find machines on the\n[local LAN and send Wake-on-Lan packets to them, which if successful mounts the C$ share](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ryuk-ransomware-uses-wake-on-lan-to-encrypt-offline-devices/)\non the machine and proceeds to encrypt the remote drive.\n\nBoth the original binary and the dropped copy (ltbyhrc.exe) perform the same tasks attempting to stop the services “audioendpointbuilder”, “samss” and “sqlwriter”, then\nattempting to delete shadow copies and create persistence. Before encryption, the malware\nalso utilizes icacls.exe - a program to change Access Control Lists - to give itself full control\nover all files and folders on the C: and D: drives.\n\nThe original binary can also be seen injecting into other processes which Cybereason\ndetects and tags with floating executable code suspicions.\n\n\n-----\n\nSuccessful execution will encrypt the user files and append a .RYK extension to them. In\norder to avoid corrupting the system, certain files such as .DLL and .EXE files are not\nencrypted. Folders that are traversed by Ryuk contain a “RyukReadMe.html” file, which in\nthis sample is very barebones, simply contains the name of the malware and a mail address\nwithout any further instructions. Perhaps the threat actors believe their reputation precedes\nthem?\n\n_Left: encrypted files with .RYK name extensions. Right: Ryuk ransom note_\n\n\n-----\n\nFor a more in-depth analysis of Ryuk, please refer to this Cybereason report: Triple Threat:\n_Emotet Deploys TrickBot to Steal Data & Spread Ryuk._\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Breakdown\n\n\n**Impact** **Execution** **Privilege**\n**Escalation**\n\n\n**Persistence** **Discovery** **Defense**\n**Evasion**\n\n\nService\nStop\n\nInhibit\n[System](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490/)\nRecovery\n\nData\n[Encrypted](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)\nfor Impact\n\nInhibit\n[System](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490/)\nRecovery\n\n\nCommand and\nScripting\n[Interpreter:](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003/)\nWindows\nCommand Shell\n\n\nProcess\nInjection\n\n\nBoot or Logon\nAutostart\nExecution:\nRegistry Run\nKeys / Startup\nFolder\n\n\nSystem\nNetwork\nConfiguration\nDiscovery\n\n\nImpair\nDefenses:\n[Disable or](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001/)\nModify\nTools\n\n\n[Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106/) File and\n[Directory](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/)\nDiscovery\n\nProcess\nDiscovery\n\n\n### INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE\n\n**Ryuk executables**\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA-256**\n\n92f124ea5217f3fe5cbab1c37a961df0437d5a9cbde1af268c60c4b3194b80ed\n\nd0d7a8f588693b7cc967fb4069419125625eb7454ba553c0416f35fc95307cbe\n\n4023a9849ee7d0c7bd80fc779e1d929c69112e324456578136c159e40449cc15\n\ndf3b813d049f8cbd0c8a3b9bb54fba9d385837dc6cced6186157c2adae56ad0e\n\n8a75b7f15ad770bb5a95b7900ac866a1845b3f20f5d22b8918d1f300435b4fc6\n\n0bb18ca131a6ee05ef081f008330d8075369a66a3e034f2412c70405d1397608\n\n44f0da753b38e9ac80f420855d40c4368a906cecb16630d80719e8f758a8c68a\n\nf266f0a4c5213f23a42787a88cd2e8df76d71b3397ed7cc45b6b535fe34a57dd\n\nBae0d9f0625000dd028c3a747b461c28e5fb5412e0de23a1f2fc2d754ac0d0fa\n\nda83298aae66af3e646b1d9aea2ce8b79514e4681e97faa020d403ca980534fd\n\n1d40658975e461af39f142b2eec149a3ec1d0071bbaf53020d8068e72243322b\n\nB624b3b297c5ebac42fabe2371b42d3add17bdb8c811ca5b51e5f27a96360a2e\n\n**SHA-1**\n\nE62135254b3a51f0180e70a11e4c3ad4a59f81c4\n\n71015f9c281038d63bf7cd45894550c1a26c6b53\n\nA6caaa8f8ab2680ce2179a7571a466beb1b60447\n\n3780f5828fc05bf74649393169f70fafb0ffed25\n\n7ad297507ca71d65c46013e02fc635bc75b0e3a2\n\nF155befc8c3c054f3858a6d3e86a7b04c0a4f5dc\n\n0a5b7330c1e06837b7d47936297f80a87c9057d9\n\n2584992238615ecbfdb83b2d86f6227d07ae4f96\n\nB1f6e6eed8dcdf4d354660c2dbec141ada621eb8\n\n845c2c82415669f8c8b3f565519e29d26d3b1f8a\n\n7ddbc35d1612162538496eb5ece5fc1b6bce6eb8\n\n834d876b47ae8e595ae417a370cd47cc8e061131\n\n\n-----\n\n**Joakim Kandefelt**\n\nJoakim Kandefelt is a Security Analyst at Cybereason and part of the Nocturnus Research\nTeam.\n\nAbout the Author\n\n**Cybereason Nocturnus**\n\nThe Cybereason Nocturnus Team has brought the world’s brightest minds from the military,\ngovernment intelligence, and enterprise security to uncover emerging threats across the\nglobe.
