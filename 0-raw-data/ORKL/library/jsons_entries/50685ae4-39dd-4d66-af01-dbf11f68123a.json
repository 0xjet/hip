INTRODUCTION \n\n The Russian invasion of Georgia was preceded by an intensive build up of cyberattacks attempting to disrupt, deface and bring down critical Georgian governmental and civilian online infrastructure. These attacks became a massive assault on the eve of the invasion which resulted in the blocking, re-routing of traffic and control being seized of various sections of Georgian cyberspace. The attack marks a new phase in the history of warfare, being the first case in which a land invasion was co- ordinated with an orchestrated online cyber-offensive. This offers crucial lessons for strategists and planners whilst providing vital information about how the Russian Federation is developing its offensive capacities on the internet. \n\n The campaign has been reported in the media, with wide coverage suggesting the campaign was a spontaneous outburst of popular feeling in Russia lead by independent hackers. However, as this report suggests, the offensive was too large, coordinated, and sophisticated to be the work of independent hackers; the evidence leads by-and- large to the Russian Business Network (RBN) in St. Petersburg, Russia.  Whilst only a criminal investigation can directly prove the involvement of the Kremlin, both experts and commentators have accused Moscow of sponsoring the attacks as their magnitude requires the involvement of the kind of resources only a state-sponsor can provide.\n\n 2. BACKGROUND ON CYBERWARFARE \n\n Cyberattacks are becoming an increasingly established and virulent form of warfare in the early Twenty-First Century. High technology and online skills are now available for rent to a variety of customers, including private individuals and terrorist organizations, and can potentially destabilize a country’s whole economy and crucial security infrastructure. Cyberwarfare has found its primary state-sponsor in the Russian Federation, which is widely suspected of having played a leading role in the first large scale cyberattack on a NATO member state last year.\n\n In the spring of 2007 government computers in Estonia came under sustained attack from cyberterrorists following the decision taken by Estonian officials to move a statue placed commemorating a Red Army soldier that died fighting the Nazis, to the military cemetery in the capital Tallinn. The event roused emotions and led to large scale protests by the Russian minority. It was then that the Estonian Government’s online networks came under massive assault using\n\n\n-----\n\n### Distributed Denial-Of-Service (DDoS) assaults on its infrastructure. The attacks, which flooded computers and servers, blocking legitimate users were described as ‘crippling’ by experts, owing to Estonia’s high dependence on information technology. Commentators have pointed out that the assault had very serious consequences for Estonia`s banks and airports. Consequences similar in effect to a full scale missile strike. This provided vital lessons for Estonia and NATO and has led to the development of a cutting edge cyberwarfare institute in Tallinn.\n\n 3. RUSSIA’S ONLINE WAR ON GEORGIA: FIRST STRIKE \n\n In August 2008, cyberwar associated with the Russian Federation struck once more, this time against Georgia. The DDoS attacks began in the weeks running up to the outbreak of the Russian invasion and continued after the Kremlin announced that it had ceased hostilities on 12 August. Georgian claims have been confirmed by Tom Burling, an executive of Tulip Systems, a U.S. Internet firm, which took over hosting of the web sites for Georgia's government agencies during the conflict. In a recent interview Burling said its experts had worked frantically to curtail the damage from the hackers, remarking that \"They have been attacking Georgia from a cyber standpoint since July.\" Some of the Western sources confirm this claim. \n\n On 20 July the Shadowserver Foundation published news about the serious attack against the website of the President of Georgia: “For over 24 hours the website of President Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia (www.president.gov.ge) has been rendered unavailable due to a multi-pronged distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.”\n\n Computerworld, 21 July: “The Web site for the president of Georgia was knocked offline by a distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attack over the weekend, yet another in a series of cyberattacks against countries experiencing political friction with Russia.”\n\n New York Times, 12 August: “Weeks before bombs started falling on\nGeorgia, a security researcher in suburban Massachusetts was watching an\nattack against the country in cyberspace.”\n\n### The Russian invasion of Georgia was preceded by a cyber attack on Georgia’s Internet facilities. A large number of Georgia’s Internet servers were seized and placed under external control from late Thursday, 7 August, whereas Russia’s invasion of Georgia officially commenced on Friday, 8 August. Also, much of Georgia’s traffic and access was taken under unauthorized external control at the same time that this first large scale attack occurred.\n\n The defacement of President Mikheil Saakashvili web site president.gov.ge with the screen-shot provided below which operated as a moving slideshow was part of the initial phase of the attack. What\n\n\n-----\n\n### followed were large numbers of DDoS against the site designed to prevent the Georgian government from getting its message across to the general population and international media during this critical time.\n\n Dancho Danchev is an independent security consultant and cyber threats analyst, with extensive experience in open source intelligence gathering, malware and E-crime incident response. As an expert in the field, he views the defacement attacks as clearly being Kremlin linked and not undertaken by independent or un-coordinated attackers.\n\n • “What am I trying to imply? It smells like a three letter intelligence agency’s propaganda arm has managed to somehow supply the creative for the defacement of Georgia President’s official web site, thereby forgetting a simple rule of engagement in such a conflict - risk forwarding the responsibility of the attack to each and every Russian or Russian supporter that ever attacked Georgian sites using publicly obtainable DDoS attack tools in a coordinated fashion.”\n\n An example of Russian efforts to shut the mouse of Georgian media is the story of the Georgian news agency GHN. The first attack against the agency’s website occurred in August 2008. Another wave of cyber attacks started on 8 September. As a result, the GHN news agency website had been paralyzed for 2 weeks. Another Georgian media website that came under consistent cyber attacks after the end of the armed conflict is www.apsny.ge – website of the Georgia-Online news agency. It is interesting to note that Russian efforts to prevent Georgian\n\n\n-----\n\n### Internet media resources from disseminating information continued even after the war.\n\n 4. CYBER BLOCKADE\n\n The Russian assault on Georgian cyberspace was intensely co- ordinated and directed out of St. Petersburg, inside the territory of the Russian Federation. The primary orchestrator was the Russian Business Network (RBN) which conducted the cyber-blockade so that all Georgian Internet traffic was going through Russia, denying Georgia its internet independence. Computers in Georgia showed that an assault was clearly taking place, which is presented here as evidence of Russian sponsored cyber-terrorism: \n\n • Two trace routes for the web site mfa.gov.ge, that of the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were showing:\n\n (a) From US - Ge = Blocked via TTnet Turkey \n\n (b) From Ukraine - Ge = available & slow; not accessible, cached (forged page) now only via redirect through Bryansk.ru\n\n • Other Georgia government websites such as  mod.gov.ge, the website of the Georgian Ministry of Defense and the web site president.gov.ge, the web site of the Georgian Presidency showed \n\n (c) From US - Ge = Blocked via TTnet Turkey\n\n (d) From Ukraine - Ge = Blocked via TTnet Turkey\n\n By examining Internet routes before and after the beginning of the war, it is clear that they were altered either legally or illegally, blocking traffic in and out of Georgia. Some of those routers are known to be under control of the Russian Business Network (RBN). This can be demonstrated via a comparison of route configuration before and after the war.\n\n 5. SITES PROVIDING DDOS ATTACK TOOLS \n\n Here we can provide clear evidence of co-ordination and a full list of targets the cyber-terrorists had selected taken from the Russian hosted web site stopgeorgia.ru (which also appears as stopgeorgia.info a redirected page). This site provided the necessary attack tools for the cyber assault against Georgia for hackers. As we can see the screen- shot shows that mostly .ge web sites are listed for priority attacks. However - also targeted for assault is the US embassy in Tbilisi. This web site, as seen before, is an open site to attract future FSB cyber warriors. The following evidence below shows how these sites can be traced back to the Russian Business Network (RBN) in ST. Petersburg and other cybercriminal locations. \n\n\n-----\n\n### • The information site Stopgeorgia.ru which provided information and tools for independent hackers to attack Georgian sites was hosted by AS36351 Softlayer of Plano Texas. This is a well known location that is associated with Atrivo and Intercage malware hosting connectivity, which is highly disruptive to online service. \n\n • The information site Stopgeorgia.info was hosted by AS28753 NETDIRECT in Frankfurt, Germany as well as in AS12578 APOLLO LATTELEKOM APOLLO in Latvia.\n\n The link back to the Russian Business Network (RBN) was provided by the clues left in the registration, which reads as: \n\n • Sponsoring Registrar: EstDomains, Inc. Registrant: Domain Manager, Protect Details, Inc, Street1: 29 Kompozitorov St., Saint Petersburg, RU, Phone:+7.8129342271\n\n In summary, 36 important web sites were identified as targets for hackers, including the US and UK Embassies in Tbilisi, Georgian Parliament, Georgian Supreme Court, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, various news agencies and other media resources, the Central Election Commission, and many others.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Due to efforts of many IT specialists in Internet hosting routing companies, normal traffic was mostly resumed after the initial strikes. Most critical websites were hosted outside of Georgia.\n\n 6. PART OF THE INFORMATION WAR\n\n To help to make a final judgment regarding the cyberwar against Georgia these two declarations from Russian officials can help us to evaluate how Moscow thinks in regard to online warfare. The Russian State Duma deputy and member of the Security Committee Deputy Nikolai Kuryanovich stated in 2006 within a formal Russian parliamentary letter of appreciation to hackers who had taken down several Israeli web sites:\n\n • \"In the very near future many conflicts will not take place on the open field of battle, but rather in spaces on the Internet, fought with the aid of information soldiers, that is hackers. This means that a\n\n\n-----\n\n### small force of hackers is stronger than the multi-thousand force of the current armed forces.\" \n\n Should we interpret this declaration as a statement of intent, or merely a prediction? A few days ago, the Editor of the Russian Online journal cybersecurity.ru, made a similar statement that provides insight into the Russian war aims:\n\n • “Cyber-attacks are part of the information war, making your enemy shut up is a potent weapon of modern warfare.” \n\n Clear examples that such thinking is being applied as guiding principles of Russian strategy as part of the intense information-war taking place can be drawn from the second wave of attacks that showed up from Russian Business Network (RBN) server range. This time the weapon was a new campaign purporting to come from the BBC that mocked Georgia's President and spread as a new virus.\n\n The malware from various locations caused the virus to be delivered from a single site, (IP address: 79.135.167.49).  The name of the malware is \"name.avi.exe\", and as of September 2008, only FOUR out of 36 anti-virus products could detect it. The Russian Business Network (RBN) had created a highly virulent strain designed to act as a propaganda weapon against Georgia.\n\n 7. RUSSIAN BUSINESS NETWORK\n\n The individual, with direct responsibility for carrying out the cyber \"first strike\" on Georgia, is a RBN operative named Alexandr A. Boykov of Saint Petersburg, Russia. Also involved in the attack was a programmer and spammer from Saint Petersburg named Andrey Smirnov. These men are leaders of RBN sections and are not \"script-kiddies\" or \"hacktivists,\" as some have maintained of the cyber attacks on Georgia – but senior operatives in positions of responsibility with vast background knowledge. \n\n Intelligence can suggest further information about these individual cyber-terrorists. According to Spamhaus SBL64881, Mr. Boykov operates a hosting service in Class C Network 79.135.167.0/24. It should be noted that the pre-invasion attacks emanated from 79.135.167.22, clearly showing professional planning and not merely ‘hacktivism.’ Due to the degree of professionalism and the required massive costs to run such operations, a state-sponsor is suspected. Further information gathered also links the RBN to known disruptive websites. \n\n • The IP addresses of the range, 79.135.160.0/19 are assigned to Sistemnet Telecom to provide services to companies who are classified as engaging in illicit activities such as credit card fraud, malware and so on.\n\n\n-----\n\n### • 79.135.160.0/19 Sistemnet Telecom and AS9121 TTNet (Turkey) are associated with AbdAllah_Internet which is linked with cybercrime hosting such as thecanadianmeds.com. These are known Russian Business Network routes.\n\n 8. THE 27 AUGUST ATTACK\n\n The last large cyberattack took place on 27 August. After that, there have been no serious attacks on Georgian cyberspace. By that is meant that minor attacks are still continuing but these are indistinguishable from regular traffic and can certainly be attributed to regular civilians. \n\n On 27 August, at approximately 16:18 (GMT +3) a DDoS attack against the Georgian websites was launched. The main target was the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \n\n The attacks peaked at approx 0,5 million network packets per second, and up to 200–250 Mbits per second in bandwidth (see attached graphs). The graphs represent a 5-minute average: actual peaks were higher.\n\n\n-----\n\n### The attacks mainly consisted of HTTP queries to the http://mfa.gov.ge website. These were requests for the main page script with randomly generated parameters. These requests were generated to overload the web server in a way where every single request would need significant CPU time. \n The initial wave of the attack disrupted services for some Georgian websites. The services became slow and unresponsive. This was due to the load on the servers by these requests.\n As you see from the graphs above the attacks started to wind down after most of the attackers were successfully blocked. The latest attack may have been initiated as a response to the media coverage on the Russian cyber attacks. \n\n CONCLUSION \n\n The information presented in here catalogues and explains the historic first major use of cyberattacks as a weapon of war during the Russian aggression against Georgia. Considering that this is the second Russian- sponsored cyber-attack in just over a year, as well as the alarming fact that the US Embassy in Tbilisi was listed for assault by cyberterrorists, NATO member states as well as NATO aspirant countries need to be on full alert for future Russian aggression against critical online infrastructure. \n\n\n-----\n\n## APPENDIX: Articles About Cyberwar on Georgia\n\n### Contents\n\n SHADOWSERVER............................................................................................................. 11\n\n COMPUTERWORLD ........................................................................................................ 13\n\n COMPUTERWORLD ........................................................................................................ 14\n\n SOFT SECURITY................................................................................................................ 15\n\n THE TELEGRAPH............................................................................................................. 15\n\n NEW YORK TIMES ........................................................................................................... 17\n\n AFP....................................................................................................................................... 19\n\n INTERNATIONAL DATA GROUP................................................................................ 20\n\n THE TELEGRAPH............................................................................................................. 22\n\n WASHINGTON POST ...................................................................................................... 23\n\n NEWSWEEK....................................................................................................................... 26\n\n AFP....................................................................................................................................... 28\n\n WASHINGTON POST (blog)............................................................................................29\n\n SHADOWSERVER\n\n20 July 2008; Updated on 10 August 2008\n\nThe Website for the President of Georgia Under Attack - Politically Motivated?\n\nFor over 24 hours the website of President Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia\n(www.president.gov.ge) has been rendered unavailable due to a multi\n\n-----\n\npronged distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. The site began coming\nunder attack very early Saturday morning (Georgian time). Shadowserver has\nobserved at least one web-based command and control (C&C) server taking\naim at the website hitting it with a variety of simultaneous attacks. The C&C\nserver has instructed its bots to attack the website with TCP, ICMP, and HTTP\nfloods.\n\nCommands seen so far are:\n\nflood http www.president.gov.ge/\nflood tcp www.president.gov.ge\nflood icmp www.president.gov.ge\n\nThe server [62.168.168.9] which houses the website has been largely offline\nsince the attack started. Passive DNS records show the system houses several\nother websites which are mostly unrelated to the Georgian government.\nHowever, the server does also host the Social Assistance and Employment\nState Agency website (www.saesa.gov.ge). This website along with the others\non the host have been rendered inaccessible.\n\nIs the attack political or perhaps nationalistic in nature? Your guess is as good\nas ours but it doesn't take much to come to this possible conclusion. Recent\nDDoS attacks against various other neighbors of Russia to include Estonia\nhave been quite popular in the last few years. We do not have any solid\nproof that the people behind this C&C server are Russian. However, the HTTPbased botnet C&C server is a MachBot controller, which is a tool that is\nfrequently used by Russian bot herders. On top of that the domain involved\nwith this C&C server has seemingly bogus registration information but does tie\nback to Russia.\n\nWho else have these guys been attacking with this MachBot C&C server? The\nanswer is no one. This server recently came online in the past few weeks and\nhas not issued any other attacks that we have observed until recently. All\nattacks we have observed have been directed right at\nwww.president.gov.ge.\n\nThe C&C server involved in these attacks is on the IP address 207.10.234.244,\nwhich is subsequently located in the United States. Beaconing traffic from\nyour network to this host may indicate that you have infected machines on\nyour network and are most likely participating in this DDoS attack. We would\nrecommend blocking and/or monitoring for traffic to this address.\n\nUpdate (7/20/2008: 1:36 PM EST): It appears the host site for 207.10.234.244 has\ntaken action against this system and appears to now be blocking access to it.\nHowever, the server being targeted by the C&C is still unreachable.\n\nUpdate (8/10/2008: 10:34 AM EDT): With the recent events in Georgia, we are\nnow seeing new attacks against .ge sites. www.parliament.ge &\npresident.gov.ge are currently being hit with http floods. In this case, the C&C\nserver involved is at IP address 79.135.167.22 which is located in Turkey. We\nare also observing this C&C as directing attacks against www.skandaly.ru.\n\n\n-----\n\nTraffic from your network to this IP or domain name of\ngooglecomaolcomyahoocomaboutcom.net may indicate compromise and\nparticipation in these attacks.\n\n### COMPUTERWORLD\n\n21 July 2008\n\nBy Jeremy Kirk\n\nGeorgia president's Web site falls under DDOS attack\n\nBotnet took down site for one day\n\nThe Web site for the president of Georgia was knocked offline by a distributed\ndenial-of-service (DDOS) attack over the weekend, yet another in a series of\ncyberattacks against countries experiencing political friction with Russia.\n\nGeorgia's presidential Web site was down for about a day, starting early\nSaturday until Sunday, according to the Shadowserver Foundation, which\ntracks malicious Internet activity.\n\nNetwork experts said the attack was executed by a botnet, or a network of\ncomputers that can be commanded to overwhelm a Web site with too much\ntraffic.\n\nThe command-and-control server for the attack is based in the U.S.,\nShadowserver said. The botnet appears to be based on the \"MachBot\" code,\nwhich communicates to other compromised PCs over HTTP, the same\nprotocol used for transmitting Web pages.\n\nThe tool used to control this kind of botnet \"is frequently used by Russian bot\nherders,\" according to Shadowserver. \"On top of that, the domain involved\nwith this [command-and-control] server has seemingly bogus registration\ninformation but does tie back to Russia.\"\n\nOne of the commands contained in the traffic directed at the Web site\ncontained the phrase \"win+love+in+Rusia,\" wrote Jose Nazario, a senior\nsecurity engineer at Arbor Networks, on a company blog.\n\nOn Sunday, it appeared that the host for the command-and-control server\nhad been taken offline, Shadowserver said.\n\nThe motivation for the attacks is not entirely clear. But Georgia is just one of\nseveral former Soviet satellites, including Estonia and Lithuania, that are\nseeking to downplay their historical legacy with Russia.\n\nGeorgia has angered Russia by pushing for entry to NATO, a pro-Western\nsecurity alliance. It has also tangled with Russia over the handling of South\nOssetia and Abkhazia, two rebellious regions pushing for independence.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn Lithuania, 300 Web sites were defaced around July 1 following a new law\nprohibiting the public display of symbols dating from the Soviet era and the\nplaying of the Soviet national anthem. The hacking was blamed on an\nunpatched vulnerability in a Web server at a hosting company.\n\nEstonian Web sites were pounded by a massive DDOS attack in April and May\n2007. The attacks are believed to have been connected to a decision to\nmove a monument honoring Soviet World War II soldiers to a less prominent\nplace, which ignited protests from ethnic Russians.\n\n### COMPUTERWORLD\n\n11 August 2008\n\nBy Gregg Keizer\n\nCyberattacks knock out Georgia's Internet presence\n\nLarge-scale attacks, traffic rerouting traced to Russian hacker hosting network\n\nAugust 11, 2008 (Computerworld) Hackers, perhaps affiliated with a wellknown Russian criminal network, have attacked and hijacked Web sites\nbelonging to Georgia, the former Soviet republic now in the fourth day of war\nwith Russia, a security researcher claimed on Sunday.\n\nSome Georgian government and commercial sites are unavailable, while\nothers may have been hijacked, said Jart Armin, a researcher who tracks the\nnotorious Russian Business Network (RBN), a malware and criminal hosting\nnetwork.\n\n\"Many of Georgia's Internet servers were under external control from late\nThursday,\" Armin said early Saturday in an entry on his Web site. According to\nhis research, the government's sites dedicated to the Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs, the Ministry of Defense, and the country's president, Mikhail\nSaakashvili, have been blocked completely, or traffic to and from those sites'\nservers have been redirected to servers actually located in Russia and Turkey.\n\nAs of midnight Eastern time on Sunday, Georgia's presidential and defense\nministry sites were unavailable from the U.S. Although the foreign ministry's site\nremained online, the most recent news item was dated Aug. 8, the day\nGeorgian and Russian forces first clashed.\n\nArmin warned that Georgian sites that appeared online may actually be\nbogus. \"Use caution with any Web sites that appear of a Georgia official\nsource but are without any recent news [such as those dated Saturday, Aug.\n9, or Sunday, Aug. 10], as these may be fraudulent,\" he said in another entry\nposted midafternoon on Sunday.\n\nStatements from Georgia's foreign ministry have appeared in a blog hosted\non Google, perhaps in an attempt to circumvent attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nResearchers at the Shadowserver Foundation, which tracks malicious Internet\nactivity, confirmed some of Armin's claims. \"We are now seeing new attacks\nagainst .ge sites [Editor's note: .ge is the top-level domain for Georgia.] ...\n_www.parliament.ge and president.gov.ge are currently being hit with HTTP_\nfloods,\" the researchers said in a Sunday update to a July post.\n\nOn Saturday, Armin reported that key sections of Georgia's Internet traffic\nhad been rerouted through servers based in Russia and Turkey, where the\ntraffic was either blocked or diverted. The Russian and Turkish servers Armin\nidentified, he said, \"are well known to be under the control of RBN and\ninfluenced by the Russian government.\"\n\nRBN, which pulled up stakes last year and shifted network operations to China\nin an attempt to avoid scrutiny, has been fingered for a wide range of\ncriminal activities, including a massive subversion of Web sites last March.\n\nLater on Saturday, Armin added that network administrators in Germany had\nbeen able to temporarily reroute some Georgian Internet traffic directly to\nservers run by Deutsche Telekom AG. Within hours, however, the traffic had\nbeen again diverted to Russian servers, this time to ones based in Moscow.\n\nThe attacks are reminiscent of other coordinated campaigns against Estonian\ngovernment Web sites in April and May 2007 and against about 300\nLithuanian sites on July 1. Like Georgia, both countries are former republics in\nthe Soviet Union.\n\nThree weeks ago, a distributed denial-of-service attack knocked Georgia's\npresidential site offline for about a day.\n\nLate Sunday, Russian ground forces were reported advancing toward Gori,\nan important transportation hub in central Georgia.\n\n### SOFT SECURITY\n\n11 August 2008\n\nThis day highlights\n\nCoordinated Russia vs Georgia cyber attack in progress (extract)\n\nIn the wake of Russian-Georgian conflict, a week worth of speculations\naround Russian Internet forums have finally materialized into a coordinated\ncyber attack against Georgia’s Internet infrastructure, whose tactics have\nalready managed to compromise several government web sites and is\ncontinuing to launch DDoS attacks against numerous other Georgian\ngovernment sites…\n\n### THE TELEGRAPH\n\nAugust 11 2008\n\n\n-----\n\nBy Jon Swaine\n\nGeorgia: Russia 'conducting cyber war'\n\nSeveral Georgian state computer servers have been under external control\nsince shortly before Russia's armed intervention into the state commenced on\nFriday, leaving its online presence in disarray.\n\nWhile the official website of Mikheil Saakashvili, the Georgian President, has\nbecome available again, the central government site, as well as the\nhomepages for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defence,\nremained down. Some commercial websites have also been hijacked.\n\nThe Georgian Government said that the disruption was caused by attacks\ncarried out by Russia as part of the ongoing conflict between the two states\nover the Georgian province of South Ossetia.\n\nIn a statement released via a replacement website built on Google's bloghosting service, the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: \"A cyber warfare\ncampaign by Russia is seriously disrupting many Georgian websites, including\nthat of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\"\n\nBarack Obama, the Democratic US Presidential candidate, has demanded\nMoscow halt the internet attacks as well as observing a ceasefire on the\nground.\n\nLast April the computer systems of the Estonian Government came under\nattack in a coordinated three-week assault widely credited to statesponsored Russian hackers. The wave of attacks came after a row erupted\nover the removal of the Bronze Soldier Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, the\nEstonian capital. The websites of government departments, political parties,\nbanks and newspapers were all targeted.\n\nAnalysts have immediately accused the Russian Business Network (RBN), a\nnetwork of criminal hackers with close links to the Russian mafia and\ngovernment, of the Georgian attacks.\n\nJart Armin, a researcher who runs a website tracking the activity of the RBN,\nhas released data claiming to show that visits to Georgian sites had been rerouted through servers in Russia and Turkey, where the traffic was blocked.\nArmin said the servers \"are well known to be under the control of RBN and\ninfluenced by the Russian Government.\"\n\nMr Armin said that administrators in Germany had intervened at the\nweekend, temporarily making the Georgian sites available by re-routing their\ntraffic through German servers run by Deutsche Telekom. Within hours,\nhowever, control over the traffic had been wrested back, this time to servers\nbased in Moscow.\n\nAs in the barrage against Estonian websites last year, the Georgian sites are\nbeing bombarded by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, in which\n\n\n-----\n\nhackers direct their computers to simultaneously flood a site with thousands of\nvisits in order to overload it and bring it offline.\n\nThe Shadowserver Foundation, which tracks serious hacking, confirmed: \"We\nare now seeing new attacks against .ge sites - www.parliament.ge and\npresident.gov.ge are currently being hit with http floods.\"\n\nMr Armin warned that official Georgian sites that did appear online may have\nbeen hijacked and be displaying bogus content. He said in a post on his site:\n\"Use caution with any web sites that appear of a Georgia official source but\nare without any recent news ... as these may be fraudulent.\"\n\n### The Baltic Business News website reported that Estonia has offered to send a specialist online security team to Georgia\n\n However a spokesman from Estonia's Development Centre of State Information Systems said Georgia had not made a formal request. \"This will be decided by the government,\" he said\n\n NEW YORK TIMES\n\n12 August 2008\n\nBy John Markoff\n\nBefore the Gunfire, Cyberattacks\n\nWeeks before bombs started falling on Georgia, a security researcher in\nsuburban Massachusetts was watching an attack against the country in\ncyberspace.\n\nJose Nazario of Arbor Networks in Lexington noticed a stream of data\ndirected at Georgian government sites containing the message:\n“win+love+in+Rusia.”\n\nOther Internet experts in the United States said the attacks against Georgia’s\nInternet infrastructure began as early as July 20, with coordinated barrages of\nmillions of requests — known as distributed denial of service, or D.D.O.S.,\nattacks — that overloaded and effectively shut down Georgian servers.\n\nResearchers at Shadowserver, a volunteer group that tracks malicious\nnetwork activity, reported that the Web site of the Georgian president, Mikheil\nSaakashvili, had been rendered inoperable for 24 hours by multiple D.D.O.S.\nattacks. They said the command and control server that directed the attack\nwas based in the United States and had come online several weeks before it\nbegan the assault.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs it turns out, the July attack may have been a dress rehearsal for an all-out\ncyberwar once the shooting started between Georgia and Russia. According\nto Internet technical experts, it was the first time a known cyberattack had\ncoincided with a shooting war.\n\nBut it will likely not be the last, said Bill Woodcock, the research director of the\nPacket Clearing House, a nonprofit organization that tracks Internet traffic. He\nsaid cyberattacks are so inexpensive and easy to mount, with few fingerprints,\nthey will almost certainly remain a feature of modern warfare.\n\n“It costs about 4 cents per machine,” Mr. Woodcock said. “You could fund\nan entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread, so\nyou would be foolish not to.”\n\nExactly who was behind the cyberattack is not known. The Georgian\ngovernment blamed Russia for the attacks, but the Russian government said it\nwas not involved. In the end, Georgia, with a population of just 4.6 million and\na relative latecomer to the Internet, saw little effect beyond inaccessibility to\nmany of its government Web sites, which limited the government’s ability to\nspread its message online and to connect with sympathizers around the world\nduring the fighting with Russia.\n\nIt ranks 74th out of 234 nations in terms of Internet addresses, behind Nigeria,\nBangladesh, Bolivia and El Salvador, according to Renesys, a Manchester,\nN.H., firm that provides performance data on the state of Internet.\nCyberattacks have far less impact on such a country than they might on a\nmore Internet-dependent nation, like Israel, Estonia or the United States,\nwhere vital services like transportation, power and banking are tied to the\nInternet.\n\nIn Georgia, media, communications and transportation companies were also\nattacked, according to security researchers. Shadowserver saw the attack\nagainst Georgia spread to computers throughout the government after\nRussian troops entered the Georgian province of South Ossetia. The National\nBank of Georgia’s Web site was defaced at one point. Images of 20thcentury dictators as well as an image of Georgia’s president, Mr. Saakashvili,\nwere placed on the site. “Could this somehow be indirect Russian action?\nYes, but considering Russia is past playing nice and uses real bombs, they\ncould have attacked more strategic targets or eliminated the infrastructure\nkinetically,” said Gadi Evron, an Israeli network security expert. “The nature of\nwhat’s going on isn’t clear,” he said.\n\nThe phrase “a wilderness of mirrors” usually describes the murky world\nsurrounding opposing intelligence agencies. It also neatly summarizes the\narray of conflicting facts and accusations encompassing the cyberwar now\ntaking place in tandem with the Russian fighting in Georgia.\n\nIn addition to D.D.O.S. attacks that crippled Georgia’s limited Internet\ninfrastructure, researchers said there was evidence of redirection of Internet\ntraffic through Russian telecommunications firms beginning last weekend. The\nattacks continued on Tuesday, controlled by software programs that were\n\n\n-----\n\nlocated in hosting centers controlled by a Russian telecommunications firms.\nA Russian-language Web site, stopgeorgia.ru, also continued to operate and\noffer software for download used for D.D.O.S. attacks.\n\nOver the weekend a number of American computer security researchers\ntracking malicious programs known as botnets, which were blasting streams\nof useless data at Georgian computers, said they saw clear evidence of a\nshadowy St. Petersburg-based criminal gang known as the Russian Business\nNetwork, or R.B.N.\n\n“The attackers are using the same tools and the same attack commands that\nhave been used by the R.B.N. and in some cases the attacks are being\nlaunched from computers they are known to control,” said Don Jackson,\ndirector of threat intelligence for SecureWorks, a computer security firm\nbased in Atlanta.\n\nHe noted that in the run-up to the start of the war over the weekend,\ncomputer researchers had watched as botnets were “staged” in preparation\nfor the attack, and then activated shortly before Russian air strikes began on\nSaturday.\n\nThe evidence on R.B.N. and whether it is controlled by, or coordinating with\nthe Russian government remains unclear. The group has been linked to online\ncriminal activities including child pornography, malware, identity theft,\nphishing and spam. Other computer researchers said that R.B.N.’s role is\nambiguous at best. “We are simply seeing the attacks coming from known\nhosting services,” said Paul Ferguson, an advanced threat researcher at\nTrend Micro, an Internet security company based in Cupertino, Calif. A\nRussian government spokesman said that it was possible that individuals in\nRussia or elsewhere had taken it upon themselves to start the attacks.\n\n“I cannot exclude this possibility,” Yevgeniy Khorishko, a spokesman for the\nRussian Embassy in Washington, said. “There are people who don’t agree with\nsomething and they try to express themselves. You have people like this in\nyour country.”\n\n“Jumping to conclusions is premature,” said Mr. Evron, who founded the\nIsraeli Computer Emergency Response Team.\n\n### AFP\n\n13 August 2008\n\nBy Glenn Chapman\n\nGeorgia targeted in cyber attack\n\n\n-----\n\nGeorgian government websites have been under intense cyber attack on\ntop of the Russian military strikes launched against the country late last week,\na US Internet firm said Tuesday.\n\nTulip Systems Inc said they took over hosting of the websites for Georgia's\npresidency and a major television network on Saturday, a day after Russian\nforces poured into Georgia in response to Tbilisi's attacks on a Moscowbacked rebel province.\n\nTulip executive Tom Burling said the distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS)\nattacks began in the weeks running up to the outbreak of the Russia-Georgia\nconflict and continued Tuesday after the Kremlin announced it had ceased\nhostilities in the former Soviet state.\n\n\"They have been attacking Georgia from a cyber standpoint since July,\"\nBurling told AFP. \"They are still doing it now.\"\n\n\"Our poor technician here has gotten three hours sleep in the past four days,\"\nhe said.\n\nBurling suggested that Russia was behind the attacks, which are similar to a\ncyber offensive waged against Estonia last year that coincided with a\ndiplomatic spat between the Baltic state and Moscow.\n\nDDoS attacks consist of overloading websites with so many online requests\nthat systems crash.\n\nBurling said Georgian government websites were being slammed with\nhundreds of millions of simultaneous requests for documents when Tulip gave\nthem refuge, Burling said.\n\n\"The cyber attack was taking down every Georgian government website,\" he\nsaid.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Georgian sites hosted on Tulip were still reportedly getting hit\nwith 68,000 requests at a time.\n\nRussia has denied involvement in cyber assaults on Georgia and experts say it\nis difficult to determine exactly who is behind such attacks.\n\n\"The Georgian government's websites have obviously been under attack,\"\nsaid Gadi Evron, an Israeli computer security specialist that investigated the\ncyber assault on Estonia.\n\n\"It is simply too early and we lack enough information to reach any\nconclusion as to the motive and identity of the attackers,\" he said.\n\nEvron said that such cyber warfare has become commonplace in the past\ndecade.\n\n\n-----\n\n\"These types of attack are only natural and happen immediately following\nany conflict or political tension,\" Evron told AFP in an email.\n\nDDoS attacks are simple, economical and hard to trace.\n\nThe assaults are typically done by using networks of computers that have\nbeen turned into \"zombies\" or \"bots\" with malicious software planted by\nhackers without the owners of machines being aware.\n\n\"Botnets\" can grow to thousands or millions of machines and be commanded\nto simultaneously make requests at targeted websites.\n\nAndre DiMino, director of Shadowserver, a nonprofit Internet security\nwatchdog with team members around the world, warned against jumping to\nthe conclusion that Russia's government is the culprit in the Georgia cyber\nattacks.\n\n\"This actually looks more like grass roots hacktivist types -- people that jumped\non the bandwagon,\" DiMino said, using Internet jargon referring to political\nactivists that resort to online evil-doing.\n\nTulip's Burling said the trend of such cyber maliciousness was a cause for\nconcern.\n\n\"It's like the Olympics. We are supposed to be above politics in the Internet\ncommunity.\"\n\nGeorgian forces attacked the Moscow-backed rebel province of South\nOssetia to regain control of the region which broke away from Tbilisi in the\nearly 1990s.\n\nRussian troops and tanks poured into Georgia on Friday after the Georgian\noffensive.\n\n### INTERNATIONAL DATA GROUP\n\n13 August 2008\n\nBy Jeremy Kirk\n\nEstonia, Poland help Georgia fight cyber attacks\n\nIn an intriguing cyber alliance, two Estonian computer experts are scheduled\nto arrive in Georgia by evening to keep the country's networks running amid\nan intense military confrontation with Russia.\n\nAnd Poland has lent space on its president's Web page for Georgia to post\nupdates on its ongoing conflict with Russia, which launched a military\ncampaign on Friday to eject Georgian troops from South Ossetia and\nAbkhazia, two renegade areas with strong ties to Russia.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe cooperation between the former Iron Curtain allies is aimed at blunting\npro-Russian computer hackers, who have been blamed over the last few\nyears for cyber attacks against Estonia, Lithuania and Georgia in incidents\nlinked to political friction between those nations and Russia.\n\nTwo of the four experts that staff Estonia's Computer Emergency Response\nTeam (CERT) were waiting Tuesday morning in Yerevan, the capital of\nArmenia, seeking permission to drive into Georgia, said Katrin Pärgmäe,\ncommunication manager for the Estonian Informatics Center. The two officials\nare also bringing humanitarian aid, she said.\n\nEstonia is also now hosting Georgia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Web site, which\nhas been under sustained attack over the last few days.\n\n\"Let's just say we moved it,\" Pärgmäe said. \"I know that there are interested\nparties who read media so it's not good to say exactly where the hosting is.\"\n\nThe Web site for Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, remained up on\nTuesday morning. That site was knocked offline around mid-July after a DDOS\nattack from a botnet, network experts said.\n\nThe botnet was based on the \"MachBot\" code, which communicates to other\ncompromised PCs over the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), the same\nprotocol used for transmitting Web pages. MachBot code has been known to\nbe used by Russian bot herders, according to the Shadowserver Foundation,\nwhich tracks malicious Internet activity.\n\nShadowserver said Monday that hackers had at one point defaced the Web\nsite for Georgia's parliament. \"The attackers have inserted a large image\nmade up of several smaller side-by-side images of pictures of both the\nGeorgian President and Adolf Hitler,\" the group wrote.\n\nGeorgia is now also hosting some sites in the U.S., a logical move to better\ndefend the sites against attacks, Pärgmäe said. Shadowserver wrote that the\npresidential site appeared to have been moved to an IP (Internet protocol)\naddress belonging to Tulip Systems, an ISP in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nThe country is also looking to other ways to keep information flowing. A\nGeorgian news site was also up, but the site warned it was under \"permanent\nDDOS attack\" That Web site has set up a group in Google's Groups service,\nwhere subscribers can get the news stories it regularly posts.\n\nGeorgia's banking sites also suffered attacks that caused them to shut down\ntheir online systems, said David Tabatadze, a security officer with the Georgia\nResearch and Educational Networking Association and Georgia's CERT. Some\nof those systems are still down, he said.\n\nTabatadze said that the majority of Georgia's Internet traffic is routed through\nTurkey, with some of it going through Russia. Although some news reports\nindicated Georgia's Internet traffic may have been shifted through Russia,\nTabatadze said that's not the case.\n\n\n-----\n\n\"We have checked the traffic route on Ripe.net...and we did not see any\ntraffic re-routing via Russia,\" Tabatadze said.\n\nIt appears that large groups of hackers are working together to take down\nthe Web sites, but the attacks have been so intense that it will take a while to\nanalyze, Tabatadze said.\n\nOther CERTs around the world have been helping to provide information on\nthe attacks, Tabatadze said.\n\nThe last few days have been a nerve-racking time for Georgians, said\nTabatadze, who said he heard explosions on Sunday when Russian planes\nbombed air-traffic control stations near Tbilisi, Georgia's capital.\n\n\"You can't even imagine the situation,\" Tabatadze said. \"This is a terrible end\nfor Georgia.\"\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Russia announced it would stop military operations in\nSouth Ossetia and Abkhazia, saying the safety of its peacekeepers in the\nregion had been secured.\n\n### THE TELEGRAPH\n\n13 August 2008\n\nBy John Swaine\n\nRussia continues cyber war on Georgia\n\nTheir assault, which began before the commencement of the five-day\nRussian military offensive, has again crashed the official website of the central\ngovernment and has been widened to include a US company which\nstepped in to rescue the website of Mikheil Saakashvili, the Georgian\nPresident.\n\nTom Burling, from Tulip Systems, which began hosting the President's site on its\nservers in Atlanta after it was brought down by the hackers, said his company\nhad become the latest target of a flood of bogus traffic sent from Russia to\ncrash the sites. He said the malicious visits were outnumbering legitimate ones\n5000 to 1.\n\nMr Burling, who has reported the attacks to the FBI, said his company was\nworking around the clock to combat the hackers. \"Our people aren't getting\nany sleep,\" he said.\n\nThe President's website is currently accessible, as are the sites of the Ministry of\nForeign Affairs and Ministry of Defence, which were also brought down in the\ninitial wave of attacks. At one stage, photographs comparing Mr Saaskashvili\nwith Adolf Hitler were posted on the Foreign Ministry's site. The website of the\nNational Bank of Georgia has also been compromised.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Russian hackers are launching waves of distributed denial-of-service\n(DDoS) attacks on the websites. This means their computers, and the\ncomputers of unsuspecting people whose home systems they have hacked\nand enlisted for their \"botnet\", or swarm of zombie computers, are directed to\nsimultaneously flood a chosen site with thousands of visits in order to overload\nit and bring it offline.\n\nLast April the computer systems of the Estonian Government came under\nattack in a co-ordinated three-week assault that was widely credited to\nstate-sponsored Russian hackers.\n\nThe Georgian Government said that the present disruption was being caused\nby attacks carried out by Russia as part of the conflict between the two\nstates, which was triggered last week over Georgia's attempt to reassert\nauthority over its northern rebel province of South Ossetia.\n\nIn a statement, the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: \"A cyber warfare\ncampaign by Russia is seriously disrupting many Georgian websites, including\nthat of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\"\n\nAnalysts immediately laid the blame for the attacks on Georgian sites with the\nRussian Business Network (RBN), a gang of criminal hackers which has close\nlinks to the Russian mafia and government.\n\nJart Armin, a researcher who tracks RBN activity, said visitors to the Georgian\nsites had been re-routed through servers in Russia and Turkey, which were\n\"well known to be under the control of RBN and influenced by the Russian\nGovernment.\"\n\nGreg Day, a security analyst at McAfee, said increasingly hacking will be a\nmatter of national security.\n\n\"We can expect to see cyber attacks being increasingly used as a weapon.\nThe benefits of using such methods are that no one is directly physically hurt\nor killed and it is much harder to pinpoint the source and who is involved,\" he\ntold Sky News.\n\nThe hackers have also been targeting the website of Garry Kasparov, the\nRussian opposition figure and former chess champion.\n\n### WASHINGTON POST\n\n27 August 2008\n\nBy Kim Hart\n\nA New Breed Of Hackers Tracks Online Acts of War\n\n'Hacktivists' Update Their Mission\n\nTORONTO -- Here in the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, a new breed\nof hackers is conducting digital espionage.\n\n\n-----\n\nThey are among a growing number of investigators who monitor how traffic is\nrouted through countries, where Web sites are blocked and why it's all\nhappening. Now they are turning their scrutiny to a new weapon of\ninternational warfare: cyber attacks.\n\nTracking wars isn't what many of the researchers, who call themselves\n\"hacktivists,\" set out to do. Many began intending to help residents in\ncountries that censor online content. But as the Internet has evolved, so has\ntheir mission.\n\nRonald J. Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab, calls the organization a \"global\ncivil society counterintelligence agency\" and refers to the lab as the \"NSA of\noperations.\"\n\nTheir efforts have ramped up in the past year as researchers gather evidence\nthat Internet assaults are playing a larger role in military strategy and political\nstruggles. Even before Georgia and Russia entered a ground war earlier this\nmonth, Citizen Lab's researchers noticed sporadic attacks aimed at several\nGeorgian Web sites. Such attacks are especially threatening to countries that\nincreasingly link critical activities such as banking and transportation to the\nInternet.\n\nOnce the fighting began, massive raids on Georgia's Internet infrastructure\nwere deployed using techniques similar to those used by Russian criminal\norganizations. Then, attacks seemed to come from individuals who found\nonline instructions for launching their own assaults, shutting down much of\nGeorgia's communication system.\n\nTwo weeks later, researchers are still trying to trace the origins of the attacks.\n\"These attacks in effect had the same effect that a military attack would\nhave,\" said Rafal Rohozinski, who co-founded the Information Warfare\nMonitor, which tracks cyber attacks, with Citizen Lab in 2003. \"That suddenly\nmeans that in cyberspace anyone can build an A-bomb.\"\n\nThe cyber attacks that disabled many Georgian and Russian Web sites earlier\nthis month marked the first time such an assault coincided with physical\nfighting. And the digital battlefield will likely become a permanent front in\nmodern warfare, Deibert said.\n\nSeven years ago, Deibert opened the Citizen Lab using grant money from the\nFord Foundation. Soon after, he and Rohozinski helped begin the OpenNet\nInitiative, a collaboration with Harvard's Law School, Cambridge and Oxford\nuniversities that tracks patterns of Internet censorship in countries that use\nfilters, such as China. The project received an additional $3 million from the\nMacArthur Foundation. Deibert and Rohozinski also launched the Information\nWarfare Monitor to investigate how the Internet is used by state military and\npolitical operations. And Citizen Lab researchers have created a software\ntool called Psiphon that helps users bypass Internet filters.\n\nThe combined projects have about 100 researchers in more than 70 countries\nmapping Web traffic and testing access to thousands of sites.\n\n\n-----\n\nA number of companies specialize in cyber security, and several nonprofit\norganizations have formed cyber-surveillance projects to keep international\nvigil over the Web. Shadowserver.org, for example, is a group of 10 volunteer\nresearchers who post their findings about cyber attacks online.\n\nThe small Toronto office of Citizen Lab, tucked in a basement of the\nuniversity's Munk Centre for International Studies, serves as the technological\nbackbone for the operations. World maps and newspaper clips cover the\nwalls. Researchers move between multiple computer screens, studying lists of\ncodes with results from field tests in Uzbekistan, Cambodia, Iran and\nVenezuela, to name a few.\n\n\"We rely on local experts to help us find out why a particular site is being\nblocked,\" Deibert said. It could be a problem with the Internet service\nprovider, a temporary connection glitch or a downed server. \"But what's more\neffective is blasting a site into oblivion when it is strategically important. It's\nbecoming a real arms race.\"\n\nHe's referring to \"denial of service\" attacks, in which hundreds of computers in\na network, or \"botnets,\" simultaneously bombard a Web site with millions of\nrequests, overwhelming and crashing the server. In Georgia, such attacks\nwere strong enough to knock key sources of news and information offline for\ndays.\n\nGeorgian Internet service providers also limited access to Russian news media\noutlets, cutting off the only remaining updates about the war. On the night of\nAug. 12 -- the height of the fighting -- \"there was panic in Tbilisi brought about\nby a vacuum of information,\" Rohozinski said.\n\nShadowserver saw the first denial of service attack against Georgia's\npresidential Web site July 20. When the fighting began, Andre M. Di Mino,\nShadowserver's founder, counted at least six botnets launching attacks, but it\nwas \"difficult to tell if it was a grass-roots effort or one commissioned by the\ngovernment.\"\n\nThe organization detects between 30 and 50 denial of service attacks every\nday around the world, and Di Mino said they have become more\nsophisticated over the past two years.\n\n\"It really went from almost a kiddie type of thing to where it's an organized\nenterprise,\" he said. But he's hesitant to label this month's attacks as a form of\ncyberwar, although he expects networks to play an expanded role in political\nclashes.\n\nJose Nazario, a security researcher with Arbor Networks, said cyber attacks\nused to target a computer's operating system. But he's seen a \"tremendous\nrise\" in attacks on Web browsers, allowing attackers access to much more\npersonal information, such as which sites a person visits frequently. An\nattacker then could learn which servers to target in order to disrupt\ncommunication.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt's unclear who is behind the attacks, however. In some cases, the locations\nof botnet controllers can be traced, but it's impossible to know whether an\nattacker is working on the behalf of another organization or government. \"It's\ngoing to take a year to figure this out,\" Nazario said.\n\nThe data trail often goes cold when it crosses borders because there is little\nlegal framework for such investigations. And many countries, along with the\nUnited Nations and other international bodies, are still weighing whether a\ncyber attack is an act of war.\n\n\"If a state brings down the Internet intentionally, another state could very well\nconsider that a hostile act,\" said Jonathan Zittrain, co-founder of Harvard's\nBerkman Center for Internet Society, and a principal investigator for the\nOpenNet Initiative.\n\nThere are also strategic reasons not to disrupt networks in order to monitor the\nenemy's conversations or to spread misinformation.\n\n\"That's an amazing intelligence opportunity,\" he said.\n\nUsing the Internet to control information can be more important than\ndisrupting the networks when it comes to military strategy, Rohozinski said. In\nGeorgia, for example, the lack of access to both Georgian and Russian\nsources of information kept citizens in the dark while the fighting continued.\n\n\"Sometimes the objective is not to knock out the infrastructure but to\nundermine the will of the people you're fighting against,\" he said. \"It's about\nthe nuts and bolts, but it's also about how perceptions can be shaped\nthrough what's available and what's not.\"\n\n### NEWSWEEK\n\n1 September 2008\n\nBy Trevis Wentworth\n\nYou’ve Got Malice\n\nRussian nationalists waged a cyber war against Georgia. Fighting back is\nvirtually impossible.\n\nOn July 20, weeks before Russia stunned Georgia with a rapid invasion, the\ncyber attack was already under way. While Moscow baited Georgia with\ntroop movements on the borders of the breakaway provinces of Abkhazia\nand South Ossetia, the \"zombie\" computers were already on the attack.\nRussian viruses had seized hundreds of thousands of computers around the\nworld, directing them to barrage Georgian Web sites, including the pages of\nthe president, the parliament, the foreign ministry, news agencies and banks,\nwhich shut down their servers at the first sign of attack to pre-empt identity\ntheft. At one point the parliament's Web site was replaced by images\ncomparing Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili to Adolf Hitler. This was not\n\n\n-----\n\nthe first Russian cyber assault—that came against Estonia, in April of 2007—but\nit was the first time an Internet attack paralleled one on land.\n\nThe labyrinthine ways of the Web and the complicated interfaces between\nthe Russian government's clandestine services and organized crime make it\nimpossible, at this point, to say with certainty who was responsible, or how far\nup the chain of command it went. The Russian military certainly had the\nmeans to attack Georgia's Internet infrastructure, says Jonathan Zittrain,\ncofounder of Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Moreover,\nthe attacks were too successful to have materialized independent of one\nanother. Bill Woodcock, the research director at Packet Clearing House, a\nCalifornia-based nonprofit group that tracks Internet security trends, says the\nattacks bear the markings of a \"trained and centrally coordinated cadre of\nprofessionals.\"\n\nBut who? Jart Armin, who has tracked Russian cybercrime, points to the\npossibility that a role was played by the notorious Russian Business Network, a\ncybermafia that specializes in identity theft, child pornography, extortion and\nother dark and lucrative Internet crimes. The RBN's political agenda is vague\nor nonexistent, but it often contracts out its services, and Armin says there is\nincreasing evidence that it is connected to, or at least tolerated by, the\nKremlin.\n\nIndeed the timing is such that it's hard to discount some sort of Kremlin\ncoordination, even if it's impossible to prove, and Woodcock argues that such\ncyber assaults have become a tool of Russian political leadership. As the\nattacks' political intentions became more specific, he notes, the operations\nhave grown more complex. In addition to targeting Georgian government\nand media Web sites, Russian hackers brought down the Russian newspaper\nSkandaly.ru, apparently for expressing some pro-Georgian sentiment. \"This\nwas the first time that they ever attacked an internal and an external target\nas part of the same attack,\" he says.\n\nFighting back is tough. When Russian hackers made a name for themselves\nlast year by bringing down the Web site of the Estonian parliament along with\nthe sites of banks, ministries and newspapers, Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas\nPaet immediately accused the Kremlin of backing the attacks. But he was\nunable to produce evidence supporting his claims. Putin eventually named a\nsuspect, or scapegoat, within his government. As Russian hackers waged a\nsimilar assault on Georgian sites over the past few weeks, Estonia—one of\nEurope's most wired countries—offered its better-defended servers to host\nmany Georgian government Web sites. Lithuania and Poland have stepped\nup as well, prompting some excited bloggers to suggest that this is a digital\nSarajevo, akin to the events of August 1914, the start of the first Internet world\nwar. Certainly that's exaggerated, but the mutual defense going on in\ncyberspace shows that these nations take the Russian threat to their online\ninfrastructure seriously.\n\nStill, the nature of the Internet is such that it is almost impossible to respond\nquickly enough. The government doesn't maintain its own botnets—large\nnetworks of zombified computers standing ready to attack—but can rent one\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom a crime network, like the Russian Business Network. Then, through statecontrolled media, the government can inspire waves of nationalists to amplify\nthe destructive force. \"Everybody with a laptop has the responsibility to attack\nthe enemy—and you find out who the enemy is by looking at what the\ngovernment is saying,\" Woodcock says.\n\nWhile no one can say who wrote the malware that was used to cause\nGeorgian servers to crash, it certainly proliferated on Russian Web sites in a\nuser-friendly form. Gary Warner, a cybercrime expert at the University of\nAlabama at Birmingham, says he found \"copies of the attack script\" posted in\nthe reader comments section at the bottom of virtually every story in the\nRussian media that covered the Georgian conflict, complete with instructions\non how the script could be used to attack a specific list of Web sites. The\nefficiency is enough to make Russia's tanks and planes and ships, however\ndeadly, appear downright anachronistic.\n\n### AFP\n\n4 September 2008\n\nExperts call for united global action against cyber attacks\n\nThe world has to unite against the growing menace of cyber terrorism, IT\nexperts said Thursday, evoking a recent \"cyber war\" against Georgia as the\nlatest example of the threat.\n\n\"The world has finally woken up and understood that cyber security needs a\nglobal approach and is a very serious matter,\" Estonian politician Mart Laar\ntold a cyber security forum in the Estonian capital Tallinn.\n\nEstonia had to deal with attacks on government websites blamed on Russian\nhackers in the spring of 2007.\n\nOfficial Georgian websites suffered a similar cyber offensive last month in the\nwake of Russia's military offensive on Georgian soil. Estonia was among\nseveral states that stepped in to host hacked Georgian websites.\n\n\"The cyber war against Georgia in August demonstrated how it has become\npart of the real war on the ground and we must act,\" Laar added.\n\nAccording to Laar, cyber attacks against the Georgian websites came a day\nahead of Russia's August 8 military action in the country, a move roundly\ncondemned in the West.\n\nRobert Kramer, vice-president of public policy for CompTIA, the Computing\nTechnology Industry Association uniting the world's top IT firms, underscored\nthat global cyber security starts at home with the average Internet user.\n\n\"The weakest link in cyber space is the human being behind the computer\nwith not enough awareness and skills on IT security matters,\" Kramer told the\nforum.\n\n\n-----\n\nHeli Tiirmaa-Klaar, an IT expert with Estonia's defence ministry, repeated the\nwarning.\n\n\"People everywhere need to understand that your unprotected computer at\nhome can be used as a tool in cyber-war,\" she said.\n\nTim Boerner, an IT security expert with the US Secret Service, said experts\nnoted increased attacks on Georgian web sites weeks before the first bombs\nfell on Georgia.\n\n\"Over one million computers worldwide were used during the cyber attacks\nagainst Estonia in spring 2007,\" he added.\n\nAn ex-Soviet republic that broke free from Moscow in 1991, the tiny Baltic Sea\nstate of Estonia joined the European Union and NATO in 2004.\n\nIt has become a leader in global IT development and has focused heavily on\ncyber security since suffering the wave of cyber attacks in early 2007.\n\n### WASHINGTON POST (blog)\n\n16 October 2008\n\nBy Brian Krebs\n\nRussian Hacker Forums Fueled Georgia Cyber Attacks\n\nAn exhaustive inquiry into August's cyber attacks on the former Soviet bloc\nnation of Georgia finds no smoking gun in the hands of the Russian\ngovernment. But experts say evidence suggests that Russian officials did little\nto discourage the online assault, which was coordinated through a Russian\nonline forum that appeared to have been prepped with target lists and\ndetails about Georgian Web site vulnerabilities well before the two countries\nengaged in a brief but deadly ground, sea and air war.\n\nThe findings come from an open source investigation launched byProject\nGrey Goose, a volunteer effort by more than 100 security experts from tech\ngiants like Microsoft and Oracle, as well as former members of the Defense\nIntelligence Agency, Lexis-Nexis, theDepartment of Homeland Security and\ndefense contractor SAIC, among others.\n\nThe group began its inquiry shortly after the cyber war disabled a large\nnumber of Georgia government Web sites. Starting with the Russian hacker\nforum Xaker.ru (hacker.ru), investigators found a posting encouraging wouldbe cyber militia members to enlist at a private, password-protected online\nforum called StopGeorgia.ru. Grey Goose principal investigator Jeff Carr said\nthe administrators of the hacker forum were keenly aware that American\ncyber sleuths were poking around: Within hours after discovering the link to\nthe StopGeorgia site, Xaker.ru administrators deleted the link and banned all\naccess from U.S.-based Internet addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt StopGeorgia.ru, project members unearthed a top-down hierarchy of\nexpert hackers who doled out target lists of Georgian government Web sites\nto relative novices, complete with instructions on how to exploit vulnerabilities\nin the sites in order to render them inaccessible. Following a July defacement\nof the Georgian president's Web site that was blamed on Russian hackers, the\nGeorgian government blocked Russian Internet users from visiting\ngovernment Web sites.\n\nBut Carr said StopGeorgia administrators also equipped recruits with\ndirections on evading those digital roadblocks, by routing their attacks\nthrough Internet addresses in other Eastern European nations. The level of\nadvance preparation and reconnaissance strongly suggests that Russian\nhackers were primed for the assault by officials within the Russian government\nand or military, Carr said.\n\n\"The fact that the StopGeorgia.ru site was up and running within hours of the\nground assault -- with full target lists already vetted and with a large member\npopulation -- was evidence that this effort did not just spring up out of\nnowhere,\" said Carr, speaking at a forum in Tysons Corner, Va., sponsored\nby Palantir Technologies, an In-Q-Tel funded company in Palo Alto, Calif.,\nwhose data analysis software helped Grey Goose investigators track the\norigins and foot soldiers involved in the cyber attack. \"If they were planning\nahead of the invasion, how did they know the invasion was going to occur?\nThe only way they could have known that is if they were told.\"\n\nInitially, security experts assumed that the sites were felled via \"distributed\ndenial of service\" (DDoS) attacks, a well-known method of assault that uses\nhundreds or thousands of compromised personal computers to flood a\ntargeted site with so much junk traffic that it can no longer accommodate\nlegitimate visitors. But investigators soon learned that attackers were\ninstructed in the ways of a far more simple but equally effective attack\nstrategy capable of throttling a targeted Web site using a single computer.\n\nSecurity researcher and Grey Goose investigator Billy Rios said attackers\ndisabled the sites using a built-in feature of MySQL, a software suite widely\nused by Web sites to manage back-end databases. The \"benchmark\" feature\nin MySQL allows site administrators to test the efficiency of database queries,\nbut last year hackers posted online instructions for exploiting the benchmark\nfeature to inject millions of junk queries into a targeted database, such that\nthe Web servers behind the site become so tied up with bogus instructions\nthat they effectively cease to function.\n\n\"Not only can a small number of users bring down the back end databases, it\nindicates that there was some form of planning, reconnaissance, and some\ntechnical sophistication by some of the members,\" Rios said. \"It also indicates\nthat all the information from the attacked systems was most likely already\ncompromised and pilfered before the injection point was posted.\"\n\nWhile Grey Goose members could find no direct link between Russian\ngovernment officials and the StopGeorgia.ru forum administrators, they claim\nit is unreasonable to conclude that no such connection exists.\n\n\n-----\n\n\"The historical record shows clear support by members of the Russian\ngovernment and implied consent in its refusal to intervene or stop the hacker\nattacks,\" the report states, naming at least three Russian politicians and\nmilitary officials who have previously endorsed coordinated cyber attacks\nagainst other nations as a show of nationalistic pride.\n\nOleg Gordievsky, a former colonel in the Russian KGB who defected to the\nBritish intelligence wing MI6 in 1985, spoke in 1998 at an international\nconference on crime and discussed how Russian hackers convicted of cyber\ncrime are sometimes offered an alternative to prison -- working for the FSB\"\n(the federal security service of the Russian Federation and a successor to the\nKGB).\n\nAccording to a cyber warfare analysis by researchers at Dartmouth College,\nMoscow has a track record of offensive hacking into Chechen Web sites. The\nresearchers provide this account of incidents in 2002, when Russian hackers\nused cyber warfare in to supplement the ongoing military conflict with\nChechnya.\n\n\"In 2002, Chechen rebels claimed that two of their Web sites, kavkaz.org and\nchechenpress.com, crashed under hack attacks by the Russian FSB security\nservice. The website crashes were reportedly timed to occur concurrently or\nshortly after Russian Special Forces troops stormed the Moscow Theater in\nwhich the rebels had taken hostages. \"On October 26 ... our Web Site\nkavkaz.org was attacked by a group of hackers,\" said a spokesman for the\nChechen rebel site run by Movladi Udugov. Following the attack on the site,\nwhich is based in the United States, Udugov said that he was \"amazed Russia's\nspecial services can operate so freely on U.S. territory.\" The attacks on one\nsite, chechenpress.com, fell under the category of brute-force denial of\nservice (DoS) attacks, while on the other site, kavkaz.org, the attacks\nappeared much more sophisticated.\n\nAccording to Chechen sources, the Web site was hijacked by hackers from\nthe FSB. The FSB hackers reportedly accomplished this by changing the\ndomain registration of the site and then eliminating the data for the site from\nthe hosting server. Upon learning of these attacks, the rebels moved the\ninformation on the sites to kavkazcenter.com. However, that site was\nattacked just a week later, also apparently the work of FSB hackers.\n\nIn July, Russian hackers were blamed for a similar assault on Lithuanian\ngovernment Web sites. In Security Fix's account of that attack, I posted a\ncopy of a congratulatory letter sent to nationalist Russian hackers by Nikolai\nKuryanovich, a former member of the Russian Duma. The missive is dated\nMarch 2006, and addresses the hacker group Slavic Union after the group\nhad just completed a series of successful attacks against Israeli Web sites.\n\n\"In the very near future many conflicts will not take place on the open field of\nbattle, but rather in spaces on the Internet, fought with the aid of information\nsoldiers, that is hackers,\" Kuryanovich wrote. \"This means that a small force of\n\n\n-----\n\nhackers is stronger than the multi-thousand force of the current armed\nforces.\"\n\nThe Grey Goose report concludes that the journeyman-apprentice\nrelationship observed in the StopGeorgia forum will continue to be the\ntraining model used by nationalistic Russian hackers, and that those hackers\nare actively engaged in finding more efficient ways to disable networks.\n\nIn the meantime, Carr said, the Russian government will continue to deny any\ninvolvement in any nation-level cyber attacks.\n\n\"The Russian government has adopted this hands-off and satisfying position of\ndeniability while enjoying the rewards achieved by the Russian hacker\ncommunity,\" Carr said.\n\n\n-----",
