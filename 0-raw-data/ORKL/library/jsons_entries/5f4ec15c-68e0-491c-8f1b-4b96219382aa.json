The\n\n highlighted operations are representative of the broader landscape of\n\n threats we investigated during this period, illustrating the key trends\n\n and developments, and contain only a fraction of the cybersecurity\n\n intelligence data provided to customers of ESET’s private APT reports.\n\n In the monitored timeframe, several China-aligned threat actors\n\n exploited vulnerabilities in public-facing appliances, such as VPNs and\n\n firewalls, and software, such as Confluence and Microsoft Exchange\n\n Server, for initial access to targets in multiple verticals. Based on the\n\n data leak from I-SOON (Anxun), we can confirm that this Chinese\n\n contractor is indeed engaged in cyberespionage. We track a part of the\n\n company’s activities under the FishMonger group. In this report, we also\n\n introduce a new China-aligned APT group, CeranaKeeper, distinguished\n\n by unique traits yet possibly sharing a digital quartermaster with the\n\n Mustang Panda group.\n\n Following the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023, we\n\n detected a significant increase in activity from Iran-aligned threat\n\n groups. Specifically, MuddyWater and Agrius transitioned from their\n\n\n###### previous focus on cyberespionage and ransomware, respectively, to\n\n more aggressive strategies involving access brokering and impact\n\n attacks. Meanwhile, OilRig and Ballistic Bobcat activities saw a\n\n downturn, suggesting a strategic shift toward more noticeable, \"louder\"\n\n operations aimed at Israel. North Korea-aligned groups continued\n\n to target aerospace and defense companies, and the cryptocurrency\n\n industry, improving their tradecraft by conducting supply-chain attacks,\n\n developing trojanized software installers and new malware strains, and\n\n exploiting software vulnerabilities.\n\n Russia-aligned groups have focused their activities on espionage\n\n within the European Union and attacks on Ukraine. Furthermore,\n\n the Operation Texonto campaign, a disinformation and psychological\n\n operation (PSYOP) uncovered by ESET researchers, has been spreading\n\n false information about Russian-election-related protests and the\n\n situation in Ukrainian Kharkiv, fostering uncertainty among Ukrainians\n\n domestically and abroad.\n\n Additionally, we spotlight a campaign in the Middle East carried out by\n\n SturgeonPhisher, a group we believe to be aligned with the interests\n\n of Kazakhstan. We also discuss a watering-hole attack on a regional\n\n news website about Gilgit-Baltistan, a disputed region administered\n\n\n###### by Pakistan, and lastly, we describe the exploitation of a zero-day\n\n vulnerability in Roundcube by Winter Vivern, a group we assess to be\n\n aligned with the interests of Belarus.\n\n ESET products protect our customers’ systems from the malicious\n\n activities described in this report. Intelligence shared here is based\n\n mostly on proprietary ESET telemetry data and has been verified by\n\n ESET researchers, who prepare in-depth technical reports and frequent\n\n activity updates detailing activities of specific APT groups. These\n\n threat intelligence analyses, known as ESET APT Reports PREMIUM,\n\n assist organizations tasked with protecting citizens, critical national\n\n infrastructure, and high-value assets from criminal and nation-state\n directed cyberattacks.\n\n More information about ESET APT Reports PREMIUM and its delivery\n\n of high-quality, strategic, actionable, and tactical cybersecurity threat\n\n intelligence is available at the ESET Threat Intelligence page.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT OCTOBER 2023 - MARCH 2024 | 4 Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n### Attackers and targets\n\n\n###### targeted government organizations and other verticals. The most\n\n significant attention was directed towards Israel, suggesting a geopolitical\n\n motive behind the threat activity in this region.\n\n Europe experienced a more diverse range of attacks from various threat\n\n actors. Russia-aligned groups continued to relentlessly target Ukrainian\n\n infrastructure, with Gamaredon standing out as the most active APT\n\n group operating in Ukraine, and Sandworm focusing on Ukrainian\n\n energy infrastructure. Russia-aligned groups also expanded their focus\n\n on espionage in the European Union, where China-aligned threat actors\n\n maintain a consistent presence, indicating a continuous interest in\n\n European affairs by both Russia- and China-aligned groups.\n\n 4.0% 4.8%\n\n 7.1%\n Russia-aligned APT groups\n 32.5%\n China-aligned APT groups\n\n Iran-aligned APT groups\n 12.7%\n North Korea-aligned APT groups\n\n Other Middle Eastern APT groups\n\n Other Eastern European APT groups\n\n 14.3% Other Asian APT groups\n\n\n###### In Asia, the focus of the described campaigns was primarily on government\n\n organizations, non-profit entities such as Tibetan groups or dissidents,\n\n and the engineering and manufacturing sectors.

It’s worth noting that in certain\n\n instances, the initial dropper appears to have been\n\n launched from a USB drive and had filenames such as\n\n Usb Disk(29GB).exe or SONY_8GR.exe.\n\n All working samples were blocked, but others were\n\n non-functional due to them having been packed with a\n\n modified version of UPX that prevented their execution.\n\n Some of the samples deployed at these cargo shipping\n\n companies have invalid Authenticode signatures and\n\n probably used DLL search-order hijacking against an\n\n old version of Nero WaveEditor. One invalid signature\n\n was copied from a binary legitimately signed by Klaas\n\n Nekeman. Another sample utilized a signature copied\n\n from a binary legitimately signed by AVG Technologies\n\n USA, a firm specializing in computer security.\n\n A note about the attribution of the recent\n\n TONESHELL campaigns\n\n Since mid-2022, campaigns using a new toolset,\n\n including the TONESHELL backdoor, have been\n\n attributed to Mustang Panda. However, after extensive\n\n analysis, we have decided to track this activity as the\n\n work of a separate threat actor that we have named\n\n CeranaKeeper. Despite some similarities, such as\n\n the use of the same DLL hijacking targets and some\n\n shared tooling, we are tracking this as a distinct threat\n\n actor due to organizational and technical differences.\n\n Mustang Panda and CeranaKeeper seem to operate\n\n\n###### independently, each with its own toolset. They may,\n\n however, rely on the same digital quartermaster or\n\n have some level of information sharing, which would\n\n explain the observed similarities. We will continue to\n\n track and report on both groups.\n\n Activities against Taiwan\n\n During the last six months, ESET researchers observed\n\n numerous campaigns carried out by China-aligned\n\n APT groups against various targets in Taiwan, where a\n\n presidential election was held this January.\n\n We observed the compromise of the network of a\n\n Taiwanese television broadcasting company that we\n\n attribute with high confidence to the SparklingGoblin\n\n group (which we documented in several publications\n\n on WeLiveSecurity).\n\n Flax Typhoon, a group documented by Microsoft,\n\n remains very active in Taiwan. During the last six\n\n months we observed Flax Typhoon compromising\n\n multiple Microsoft Exchange servers and deploying\n\n China Chopper webshells. Even though focused\n\n exclusively in Taiwan, Flax Typhoon’s targeting seems\n\n opportunistic and the victimology is broad: the group\n\n targeted several government organizations, but also\n\n a consulting firm, a travel booking software company,\n\n and the pharmaceuticals and electronics verticals.\n\n As mentioned by Microsoft, Flax Typhoon operators\n\n\n###### deploy the legitimate SoftEther VPN client and VPN\n\n bridge, and establish a persistent VPN connection on\n\n compromised systems, allowing them to RDP directly\n\n to the compromised systems.\n\n ESET researchers also discovered two undocumented\n\n Linux backdoors used by Gelsemium (a group that we\n\n documented in a white paper on WeLiveSecurity)\n\n against Linux servers in Taiwan, probably exploiting an\n\n Apache Tomcat vulnerability. One of these backdoors,\n\n which we named WolfsBane, is a Linux variant of the\n\n Gelsevirine backdoor. The second backdoor, which we\n\n named FireWood, is connected to Project Wood (which\n\n we documented in a WeLiveSecurity blogpost),\n\n previously used by Gelsemium during Operation\n\n TooHash, as documented by G Data.\n\n Finally, considering Linux malware, we observed the\n\n tentative deployment of the Linux variant of the Winnti\n\n malware against a computer science department of\n\n a Taiwan university. Unfortunately, since the Winnti\n\n malware is shared among several China-aligned APT\n\n groups, we cannot conclusively attribute this attack.\n\n Our assessment of the  I-SOON leaks\n\n On February 16, 2024, a leak containing internal data of\n\n the I-SOON (Anxun) company was posted on GitHub\n\n at https://github.com/I-S00N/I-S00N/.\n\n\n###### We believe the leak is authentic. While it’s not possible\n\n for us to validate every single document, we can\n\n corroborate enough of the documents as authentic to\n\n be highly confident in this assessment.\n\n We can also independently confirm that I-SOON\n\n is indeed a Chinese contractor engaged in\n\n cyberespionage. What we are tracking under the\n\n group name FishMonger corresponds to part of the\n\n company’s activities (note that the link was also\n\n confirmed by PwC analysts). While I-SOON is based in\n\n Shanghai, most of the R&D is located in Chengdu. This\n\n city also hosts the infamous Chengdu 404 network\n\n company, but both should not be mixed. In October\n\n 2023, it was revealed that the two companies are\n\n opponents in a court case. I-SOON’s website is not\n\n accessible anymore since the release of the leak, but\n\n it was archived before it was taken offline. On this\n\n website, I-SOON publicly advertised having China’s\n\n Ministry of Public Security as a customer and of\n\n carrying out offensive and defensive operations.\n\n Interestingly, one IP address mentioned in the leaked\n\n chat logs (8.218.67[.]52) was used during Operation\n\n ChattyGoblin – a series of attacks against Southeast\n\n Asian gambling companies that we documented\n\n in our Q4 2022-Q1 2023 APT activity report on\n\n WeLiveSecurity. According to ESET telemetry, that\n\n server was hosting the web interfaces for the NPS and\n\n Maisui network proxying tools in June 2022. During\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT OCTOBER 2023 - MARCH 2024 | 8 Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n\n###### our research, we could not tie that activity to a known group. In the leaked\n\n I-SOON chat logs shown in Figure 1, an employee asks for access to a\n\n machine, apparently for a third party, and another employee provides the\n\n credentials to log into that server. Note that this dialog also happened in\n\n June 2022.\n\n 2022-06-13 07:39:19 user_1: Asking about personal PC access\n\n in Yangzhou\n\n 2022-06-13 07:39:23 user_1: Can I give it now\n\n 2022-06-13 07:40:26 user_2: 8.218.67[.]52:27011 [account]】\n\n admin [password] 88888888\n\n Figure 1. Extract of I-SOON leaked chat logs (machine translated)\n\n Therefore, we now attribute Operation ChattyGoblin’s activity to I-SOON,\n\n with medium confidence.\n\n The leak offers some interesting perspective on the motivations behind\n\n these attacks against gambling companies. In particular, I-SOON provides\n\n to its customers a platform to investigate gambling cases – gambling is an\n\n illegal activity in the People’s Republic of China – named the Falcon Anti\n Gambling Platform. That platform relies on “backend data of domestic and\n\n foreign gambling websites“, according to its leaked documentation, and\n\n allows its users to search for data on gamblers and gambling companies.\n\n This very likely explains the purpose of Operation ChattyGoblin: to hack\n\n into gambling companies to exfiltrate data to feed to the Falcon platform.\n\n\n###### Overall, the leak offers an unprecedented view of the internals of the\n\n company, including some of its products, its HR challenges, its customers,\n\n and its victims. Our analysis reveals a few global points:\n\n • [I-SOON works mostly for the Chinese ][Ministry of Public Security] (MPS), not only by providing stolen data and ready-to-use malware, but also by training MPS employees in several provinces.\n\n • [I-SOON resells ShadowPad (internal name: SecuritySystem), Winnti ] for Linux (internal name: Threadstone), and an unknown Linux implant named Hector.\n\n • [I-SOON also has iOS and Android implants that are probably related to ] the POISON CARP group.\n\n • [The list of victims reveals the targeting of universities in Hong Kong in ] 2019. This is in line with our findings published on WeLiveSecurity. We initially attributed the incident to Winnti Group but have since revised\n\n our attribution to FishMonger.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT OCTOBER 2023 - MARCH 2024 | 9 Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n## Middle East\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT OCTOBER 2023 - MARCH 2024 | 10 Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n\n###### BladedFeline POLONIUM MuddyWater OilRig Ballistic Bobcat Agrius\n##### Summary of Middle Eastern APT group activity\n\n\n###### Government\n\n Engineering and manufacturing\n\n Telecommunications\n\n Communications\n\n Retail\n\n Non-profit\n\n Education\n\n Financial services\n\n Transportation\n\n Construction\n\n Healthcare\n\n Sectors targeted by Middle Eastern APT groups\n\n Spearphishing attachment (T1566.001)\n\n Spearphishing link (T1566.002)\n\n Fake app (T1444, MITRE ATT&CK v7)\n\n Exploit of public facing application (T1190)\n\n\n###### 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n\n###### BladedFeline\n\n During the past two quarters, BladedFeline continued\n\n to exploit a governmental organization from the\n\n Kurdistan region of Iraq. The coding capabilities of\n\n this group, which has interests that align with Iran,\n\n specifically targeting longtime rival Iraq, display a\n\n breadth of skill, deploying payloads written in Python,\n\n C#/.NET, and C++, which makes them something of an\n\n oddity amongst Middle East-aligned (and Iran-aligned)\n\n groups. The group is also quite proficient in PowerShell\n\n and VBScript, having deployed tools using both in what\n\n are best characterized as well-written scripts that are a\n\n notch above other groups in the region.\n\n The group has gone to some lengths to maintain\n\n access to this governmental organization, having\n\n breached it at several layers and reinforcing access by\n\n innovating new backdoors and tunneling applications.\n\n In addition to the governmental organization,\n\n\n###### BladedFeline also compromised a telecommunications\n\n provider in Uzbekistan. We detected the attack during\n\n this reporting period; however, the initial compromise\n\n time probably dates back to May 2022. Targeting\n\n this victim is interesting in the timing, particularly if\n\n the links to Iran-aligned groups pan out, as Iran has\n\n recently been noted to be considering rapprochement\n\n with Central Asian countries. Having followed\n\n Middle Eastern groups for some time, we can say that\n\n cyberespionage goes hand in hand with diplomatic\n\n efforts, particularly when it comes to Iran.\n\n POLONIUM\n\n During this reporting period, we observed POLONIUM,\n\n a threat actor aligned with Hezbollah’s interests,\n\n continue to be avid Python coders. In November\n\n 2023, POLONIUM used a Python backdoor, MegaPy,\n\n and an exfiltrator to exploit four Israeli organizations\n\n in the technology and social services verticals. The\n\n\n###### Initial access techniques used by Middle Eastern APT groups (with MITRE ATT&CK IDs)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT OCTOBER 2023 - MARCH 2024 | 11 Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n\n###### backdoor uses MEGA and Nextcloud for C&C communications and, for the\n\n exfiltrator, for data storage. An interesting feature of the exfiltrator is that\n\n the WebDAV protocol is used, which is not something we commonly see in\n\n malware communications.\n\n Then in January 2024, POLONIUM deployed an update of its Python\n\n backdoor to construction, manufacturing, and healthcare companies in\n\n Israel. This iterative update employs encrypted payloads with per-victim,\n\n customized content, probably to mask some of the exploit chain from\n\n defenders and to make tracking more difficult for researchers. During this\n\n campaign, POLONIUM changed the service providers used for its C&Cs:\n\n Supabase and Backendless. Initial payload hosting was done, in one\n\n particular case, on a typo-squatting domain: yutube.com[.]de.\n\n\n###### MuddyWater OilRig Ballistic Bobcat Agrius\n##### Summary of Iran-aligned APT group activity\n\n\n###### ESET researchers, while tracking Iran-aligned threats, have observed\n\n a sharp uptick in activity following the attack on Israel on October 7,\n\n 2023. The increased activity has been focused on two primary pursuits:\n\n access brokering, typified by access development immediately followed\n\n by credential theft; and, subsequent attacks seeking to damage, destroy,\n\n or otherwise harm organizations, with the occasional name-and-shame\n\n post-impact activity on social media. Commensurate with the uptick in\n\n operational tempo has been a marked decline in attack efficacy and overall\n\n quality of operations and tooling (particularly with MuddyWater, which has\n\n not historically been a powerhouse in APT circles).\n\n This increase in operational tempo and focus on access brokering in\n\n conjunction with impact malware has likely led to a decrease in typical\n\n cyberespionage. We have noted a downturn in OilRig activities, beginning\n\n in November and culminating in December. Since then, OilRig has been\n\n unusually quiet, whereas we would typically expect to see the group\n\n updating existing tooling to maintain previously established accesses\n\n and deploying new, often novel, malware to target mostly governmental\n\n entities in the Middle East – with a heavy focus on Israel.\n\n Ballistic Bobcat, which also has generally been a steady purveyor of\n\n malware, also seemed to wind down operations in September and October.\n\n\n###### Although, in that timeframe, we did see Ballistic Bobcat employing TTPs\n\n we associate with MuddyWater, including the use of remote access tools\n\n (RemCom), PowerShell scripts, and manual operator command line\n\n execution of a variety of commands. Overall, we assess that a great many\n\n Iran-aligned threat actors have shifted focus to support efforts to attack\n\n Israel with loud attacks and have largely eschewed quieter operations.\n\n Access brokering\n\n The group doing the bulk of the yeoman’s work in this area is, perhaps\n\n unsurprisingly, MuddyWater. The primary initial access method has\n\n been phishing emails with maliciou link that, when clicked, download a\n\n remote access tool (RAT), also referred to as a remote management and\n\n monitoring (RMM) tool. A less seen but equally successful initial access\n\n tactic is a phishing email with an attached document that includes a\n\n malicious link that, when opened, downloads the same or similar RAT/\n\n RMM. This extra step was only adopted by MuddyWater at the end of Q1\n\n 2024, probably to evade defenders from blocking the previously employed\n\n method that was publicly reported by Proofpoint.\n\n In addition to MuddyWater, we also observed Agrius both attempting\n\n access brokering activities and deploying impactful malware to victims in\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT OCTOBER 2023 - MARCH 2024 | 12 Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n\n###### Israel. This represents a departure from typical Agrius activity, which has\n\n historically been focused on wipers, ransomware, or some variation of the\n\n two, without any credential theft endeavors.\n\n Subsequent to the initial access, MuddyWater has employed a variety\n\n of tools and techniques attempting to obfuscate C&C servers. Typical\n\n RATs/RMMs include Atera, SimpleHelp, and TacticalRMM. Beyond that,\n\n though, MuddyWater operators have literally been scraping GitHub and\n\n the internet for any and all tooling they can find that offers reverse-shell\n like capabilities. Aside from old MuddyWater staples like Ligolo, frp, and\n\n Venom, they have also used Bore, GoSocks5, Koblas, rathole, ReSocks,\n\n ReSocks-5 (in C++ and Go), Revsocks, and Yamux. Many would-be victims\n\n received more than a handful of these tools, which were quite often\n\n blocked by ESET software…leading to several comical instances of operators\n\n attempting to execute the same tools repeatedly.\n\n Finally, MuddyWater deployed additional tooling to establish persistence\n\n (occasionally) and gather credentials. For the former, MuddyWater\n\n continued looking for resources on the internet, including AutodialDLL\n\n (which was publicly reported on by Palo Alto). As to the former,\n\n MuddyWater deployed an LSASS dumper disguised as 7-Zip and a credential\n\n stealer masquerading as a Java update. In several cases, MuddyWater\n\n used a tool, RunPEinMemory, to attempt to bypass ESET security tooling\n\n (unsuccessfully) by loading malware into memory, then executing it.\n\n Impact attacks with wipers and ransomware\n\n We observed three distinct impact attacks (e.g., wipers, ransomware)\n\n during this period. The first occurred at the end of October, which we\n\n dubbed BiBiGun Wiper, based on the file extension that was used to\n\n overwrite files (.bibi). Initially reported by Security Joes, we quickly\n\n1 SHA-1: C9D18D01E1EC96BE952A9D7BD78F6BBB4DD2AA2A\n\n\n###### pivoted on the Linux version to find a Windows variant. It is not clear to us\n\n whether any of the aforementioned access brokering was used to facilitate\n\n access to victims, as we did not see any victims with ESET software\n\n installed.\n\n The second occurrence took place at roughly the same time. Agrius\n\n deployed a wiper to victims in Israel in the communications vertical\n\n (among others we could not identify). Palo Alto and the Israeli CERT each\n\n published an article about this attack. The version of the wiper observed in\n\n our telemetry is a BIOS wiper based on the Red Petya wiper. Perhaps more\n\n interesting than the wiper, though, is the use of a modified version of Plink\n\n that Agrius used like a reverse tunnel: it requires base64-encoded runtime\n\n arguments. In addition, Agrius also deployed several LSASS dumpers\n\n to victims before deploying the wiper, likely to add access brokering for\n\n future attacks. One additional tidbit we saw is that both Agrius (during\n\n this incident) and Ballistic Bobcat (in previous attacks) have used the same\n\n SQL dumping tool, perhaps indicating tool sharing across these previously\n\n unlinked groups.\n\n The final occurrence was in March 2024 and was perpetrated by an as\n yet-unattributed group with goals that coalesce with Iran-aligned threat\n\n actors. The wiper targeted at least 19 organizations in Israel over a wide\n\n range of verticals. The group’s TTPs align with other Iran-aligned groups,\n\n most notably MuddyWater, in that several remote access tools were used\n\n to drop files on victim systems, including AnyDesk, N-Able, and UltraVNC.\n\n Additionally, the string AaronBushnell is included in all wiper samples\n\n discovered. Aaron Bushnell was an enlisted member of the United States\n\n Air Force prior to his self-immolation in front of the Israeli embassy in\n\n Washington, DC on February 25, 2024. In the days following his death,\n\n many pro-Iranian figures – including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – have used\n\n\n###### Bushnell as a talking point supporting Iranian interests. It follows that\n\n groups with interests aligned with Iran would also use Bushnell’s name.\n\n While we cannot definitively state that access broker operations were\n\n involved in this last wiper attack, it does seem highly plausible based on the\n\n suddenness of the attack (carried out over two days), and the large number\n\n of victims with seemingly no indicators of compromise leading up to the\n\n wiper’s deployment.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT OCTOBER 2023 - MARCH 2024 | 13 Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n## North Korea\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT OCTOBER 2023 - MARCH 2024 | 14 Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n Andariel Lazarus ScarCruft Kimsuky Konni\n\n##### Summary of North Korea- aligned APT group activity\n\n###### 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n\n###### In the current reporting period period, we noticed\n\n several interesting trends. All groups continued to\n\n improve their tradecraft by either developing new\n\n malware strains or using techniques successfully used\n\n in the past by North Korea-aligned groups.\n\n Lazarus continued to target aerospace and defense\n\n companies, with the presumed goal of espionage.\n\n At the same time, we noticed that Lazarus appears\n\n to be putting a larger effort into targeting the\n\n cryptocurrency industry, both organizing crypto\n\n heists and compromising developers working on\n\n cryptocurrency projects. According to a Microsoft\n\n report, cryptocurrency worth between $600 million\n\n and $1 billion was stolen by North Korea-aligned threat\n\n actors in 2023.\n\n Both ScarCruft and Konni ran spearphishing campaigns\n\n targeting individuals and organizations in South Korea.\n\n In addition, Konni apparently targeted selected Russian\n\n government employees in a campaign we investigated\n\n\n###### in December 2023. We also detected activity of\n\n different Kimsuky clusters worldwide.\n\n The primary compromise vector remains spearphishing.\n\n Lazarus continued using fake job offers in its Operation\n\n DreamJob, whereas ScarCruft and Konni often used\n\n cryptocurrency, Know Your Customer, or business\n\n agreement lures, to target selected individuals. Andariel\n\n used several publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in web\n\n applications as the initial access vector.\n\n Supply-chain attacks and trojanized installers\n\n In this period, there was a noticeable increase in\n\n broadscale campaigns using supply-chain compromises\n\n and trojanized software installers.\n\n In November 2023, Microsoft uncovered a Lazarus\n linked attack on CyberLink – a Taiwanese multimedia\n\n software company. Attackers compromised the\n\n\n###### Engineering and manufacturing\n\n Defense\n\n Education\n\n Information and cultural industries\n\n Sectors targeted by North Korea-aligned APT groups\n\n 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n Spearphishing attachment (T1566.001)\n\n Exploit of public facing application (T1190)\n\n Trusted relationship (T1199)\n\n Supply-chain compromise (T1195)\n\n Initial access techniques used by North Korea-aligned APT groups (with MITRE ATT&CK IDs)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT OCTOBER 2023 - MARCH 2024 | 15 Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n\n###### Evolving attackers’ toolset\n\n Speaking of attacker’s tools and techniques, we noticed\n\n a shift towards the use of malicious LNK (Windows\n\n shortcut) files. ScarCruft, Konni, and Kimsuky all\n\n started using v\"very similar LNK files with artificially\n\n inflated sizes. PowerShell emerged as the favorite\n\n scripting language for these threat actors – long\n\n PowerShell command lines are used to extract and\n\n decrypt malicious payloads embedded in the shortcut\n\n file itself. Previously, these actors used CHM (Compiled\n\n Windows Help) files and the MSHTA engine to achieve\n\n their goals.\n\n Lazarus developed a new backdoor that we named\n\n WebLogTea. We were able to analyze both macOS\n\n and Linux versions of the backdoor, which were\n\n distributed via trojanized PyPI packages in February\n\n 2024. WebLogTea was also independently analyzed and\n\n described by researchers at Vipyr Security.\n\n In the middle of 2023, Kimsuky was observed using\n\n AlphaSeed, which is newly developed malware written\n\n in Go, as well as proxy malware. Throughout the rest\n\n of 2023 and the beginning of 2024, Kimsuky continued\n\n with the trend of developing new malware strains in\n\n Go. In particular, various security vendors described and\n\n named TrollAgent, Endoor, and Nikidoor. We attribute\n\n all this new malware to the Kimsuky AppleSeed cluster.\n\n\n###### people into installing them. These packages would\n\n act as downloaders for further malicious components\n\n and were targeting three major operating systems –\n\n Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n\n\n###### company, inserted malicious code into its software\n\n build and delivery process, hence any resulting binaries\n\n would be trojanized and be signed by the company’s\n\n digital certificate and released via official channels to\n\n the company’s users.\n\n In December 2023, ESET detected Kimsuky malware\n\n on several machines belonging to a construction\n related entity in South Korea. The analysis of the attack\n\n revealed that the malware was downloaded and\n\n executed, by employees, on the entity’s compromised\n\n servers that were running the WIZVERA VeraPort\n\n solution. According to our data, the attack continued\n\n until January 2024. Interestingly, the malware was\n\n available for download only in specific timeframes.\n\n Outside of these timeframes, the compromised\n\n servers served legitimate binaries. This was confirmed\n\n in an AhnLab report, published in February 2024.\n\n Additionally, AhnLab estimated that the total number\n\n of afflicted machines was over 3,000, showing that this\n\n attack had a relatively large number of victims.\n\n Konni used a trojanized installer of a very niche\n\n application to target employees of Russian embassies\n\n as seen in Figure 2. The same approach was also used\n\n by Lazarus in its DreamJob campaigns. Trojanized PDF\n\n viewers and trojanized VNC applications were delivered\n\n to victims as a part of a job application process, which\n\n served as the initial compromise vector.\n\n\n###### Last but not least, Lazarus was observed uploading\n\n trojanized JavaScript and Python packages to open\n source package repositories like NPM and PyPI,\n\n imitating popular package names in order to trick\n\n\n###### Figure 2.

In a campaign we investigated, emails\n\n sent to targets contained either malicious links or\n\n malicious attachments. When successful, these were\n\n ultimately used to harvest credentials from the targets\n\n or directly install malicious payloads onto their systems.\n\n Spearphishing as initial access\n\n Since the end of February 2024, we observed a wave of\n\n spearphishing emails targeting European governmental\n\n entities and attempting to exploit the CVE-2024-21413\n\n vulnerability in Outlook, aka the Moniker Link bug.\n\n Figure 3 shows an example of one of these emails,\n\n\n###### using the European Council calendar as a lure. Note\n\n that the sender email address and the email’s signature\n\n impersonate a real person who works as a press officer\n\n for the Council.\n\n Examining the victimology of the incidents, it becomes\n\n evident that the pattern of targeting aligns with the\n\n modus operandi commonly associated with Sednit.\n\n Callisto\n\n In December 2023, the UK government publicly\n\n attributed Callisto to the FSB’s 18th Center for\n\n Information Security of the Russian Federation,\n\n establishing a strong link between the group and the\n\n Russian government.\n\n In February 2024, an article was published by The\n\n Record, in which they explain how Callisto targeted\n\n Keir Giles, a well-known researcher and fellow at the\n\n Chatham House think tank. The Callisto group primarily\n\n uses phishing emails sent from Proton Mail addresses\n\n\n###### Initial access techniques used by Russia-aligned APT groups (with MITRE ATT&CK IDs)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT OCTOBER 2023 - MARCH 2024 | 18 Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n\n###### Figure 3. Body of a phishing email using the European Council calendar as a lure\n\n\n###### and attaches a blurred PDF to entice the target to log into a fake webmail\n\n page. We have detected similar phishing emails: see Figure 4.\n\n Note that the attackers tried to convince the victim that they were replying\n\n to an existing email, while both were actually created by the attackers. In\n\n this case, Callisto impersonated James Sherr, a fellow at Chatham House\n\n and specialist in Soviet and Russian military matters. Note that he was\n\n sanctioned by the Russian government in February 2024.\n\n Cyberespionage operation against European governments\n\n In 2023, we detected two previously unknown backdoors that we call\n\n LunarWeb and LunarMail. They were used in compromises of a European\n\n ministry of foreign affairs and its diplomatic missions abroad.\n\n Both backdoors share a loader that uses the DNS domain name for\n\n decryption of the payload, have code overlaps, and support similar\n\n commands, but differ in C&C communication methods. LunarWeb,\n\n deployed on servers, uses HTTP(S) and attempts to blend in by mimicking\n\n the traffic of legitimate services such as Windows Update. LunarMail,\n\n deployed on workstations, piggybacks on Outlook and communicates via\n\n email messages. The backdoors hide commands and data in images and\n\n documents and both have the unusual capability of being able to execute\n\n Lua scripts.\n\n We believe with high confidence the backdoors have been used for years\n\n – since at least 2020 and possibly earlier. Based on similarities with past\n\n activity, we attribute the compromises to Turla with medium confidence.\n\n\n###### Russia-Ukraine war\n\n Gamaredon\n\n Gamaredon remains the most active APT group operating in Ukraine,\n\n with thousands of daily detections, as illustrated in Figure 5 below. It uses\n\n spearphishing emails as one of its initial access vectors. The emails contain\n\n an XHTML file attachment that utilizes HTML smuggling to deliver a ZIP\n\n archive containing an HTA file. This HTA file then downloads another HTA\n\n file that contains a VBScript downloader that can deliver various payloads.\n\n During this period, we discovered a new version of commonly used\n\n downloaders written in PowerShell that we call PteroPSLoad. This time\n\n PteroPSLoad has been using the Cloudflare Tunnel client and ngrok utility in\n\n order to communicate with its C&C servers.\n\n\n###### Figure 5.

The same\n\n month, the pro-Russian Telegram channel @solntsepekZ, which has been\n\n used to amplify Sandworm’s attacks, claimed that Sandworm is responsible\n\n for the cyberattack against Kyivstar.\n\n In January 2024, we detected Sandworm activity directed against a regional\n\n power supply company in Ukraine.\n\n In March 2024, the same Telegram channel announced a cyberattack\n\n against four small internet providers in Ukraine. SentinelLabs analyzed\n\n AcidPour, a Linux wiper, which might have been used in this cyberattack.\n\n Note that in addition to Sandworm, we have detected the group UAC-0099\n\n targeting energy companies in Ukraine in the last few months. This, along\n\n with the ongoing physical destruction of Ukrainian energy infrastructure\n\n with missile barrages, underscores the energy vertical as one of the\n\n primary targets for Russia.\n\n Operation Texonto\n\n In February 2024, we published a blogpost about a disinformation and\n\n psychological operation (PSYOP) campaign we named Operation Texonto.\n\n This campaign is trying to raise doubts in the minds of Ukrainians and\n\n Ukrainian speakers abroad. Attackers primarily use emails as the main\n\n distribution method for their PSYOP messages.\n\n In March 2024, we observed new Operation Texonto activity directed\n\n against various individuals in Russia, most likely Russian dissidents.\n\n Attackers were trying to impersonate Alexey Navalny’s team in order\n\n to disorganize the noon voting protest of Navalny’s supporters during\n\n Russia’s 2024 presidential election. \n\n\n###### Figure 6.

In this\n\n section, we highlight a recent SturgeonPhisher campaign in the Middle\n\n East, a watering-hole attack on a regional news website that delivers news\n\n about Gilgit-Baltistan (a disputed region administered by Pakistan), and the\n\n exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability in Roundcube by Winter Vivern.\n\n SturgeonPhisher\n\n SturgeonPhisher (also known as YoroTrooper) is a cyberespionage group\n\n that we believe is aligned with the interests of Kazakhstan. The group\n\n mainly targets governments in Central Asia, but campaigns in recent\n\n months suggest that they are also tasked with intelligence gathering\n\n operations worldwide.\n\n In particular, we noticed that in November 2023, a month after the start\n\n of the armed conflict between Israel and Hamas, SturgeonPhisher created\n\n phishing websites targeting ministries of foreign affairs in Iran and Yemen.\n\n It is the first time that we have noticed any Middle Eastern countries to be\n\n of interest to the group.\n\n Figure 10 shows an Axigen WebMail phishing page hosted at\n\n mail.mofa.middleast-gov[.]com.\n\n\n###### Unlucky Kamran\n\n In activity reported in November 2023,\n\n Figure 10.
