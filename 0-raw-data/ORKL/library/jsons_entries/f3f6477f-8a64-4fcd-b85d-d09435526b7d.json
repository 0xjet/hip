ISFB reappeared in early 2013\nattracting some attention from the research community and a lot of confusion in the naming\nconvention and to what was being analyzed. Then suddenly, it went dark again. However,\ndark does not mean dead. With attention of the world focused on Dridex and Dyre, ISFB\nsilently evolved, hiding from the spotlight to become one of the most complex and fully\nfeatured banking trojans out there In this paper, we break the silence surrounding ISFB,\ngiving a full description of this malware capabilities which are beyond those of the average\nbanking trojan: 4 ways of communicating with the CC, half a dozen tricks to steal your\nmoney, the ability to create movies of your activity and naturally numerous ways of\nmanipulating your web traffic.\n\n## References\n\n[1] D.
