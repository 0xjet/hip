In each campaign, the attackers typically target a small amount of\nindividuals—rather than enterprises or governments—using economic, military, topical, or\ngeneric lures. On average, less than ten unique computers are infected per month and\nthere is no indication that the attackers are trying to spread through the victim’s local\nnetwork, suggesting that Scarab’s campaigns are extremely targeted in nature.\n\nMany of Scarab’s campaigns focus on distributing the group’s custom malware\n[(Trojan.Scieron and](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-072320-5920-99) [Trojan.Scieron.B) through emails with malicious attachments. These](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-081114-0917-99)\nfiles contain exploits that take advantage of older vulnerabilities that are already patched by\nvendors. If the attackers successfully compromise the victims’ computers, then they use a\n\n\n-----\n\nbasic back door threat called Trojan.Scieron to drop Trojan.Scieron.B onto the computer.\nTrojan.Scieron.B has a rootkit-like component that hides some of its network activity and\nfeatures more enhanced back door functionality.\n\n**Who are the Scarab attackers?**\n\nBased on our research, the Scarab attackers are a technically capable group, judging on\nhow they have custom-developed several malicious tools for these campaigns. However,\nthey are not highly skilled or well resourced, as they rely on older exploits and executables\nstored in compressed archives to distribute their threats.\n\nThere are some indications (based on language resources) that the attackers are familiar\nwith Chinese-language characters, and they seem to mostly target Russian speakers\nlocated in Russia and other regions around the world.\n\n_Figure 1. Scarab victims based on Symantec telemetry_\n\nThe group conducts command-and-control (C&C) operations almost exclusively through the\nuse of dynamic domain name system (DNS) domains. The C&C servers are usually hosted\nin South Korea; however, there have been instances where servers were located in other\ncountries.\n\nFor the majority of 2012, there was not much information about Scarab’s victims. However\nfrom October 2012, a number of emails used by Scarab were blocked by Symantec .Cloud.\nAll of the emails were sent from @yandex.ru email addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Early attacks**\nOn October 29, 2012, an email with the Russian-language subject “Экспериментальное\nопределение эффективно” was sent to two individuals working for a large retail\norganization. Translated to English, the email’s subject is “Experimental definition is\neffective.”\n\nThese emails contained Microsoft Word attachments that triggered an exploit taking\nadvantage of the Microsoft Windows Common Controls ActiveX Control Remote Code\nExecution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158). Once triggered, the exploit dropped a copy of\nTrojan.Scieron onto the victim’s computer. The attackers continued to intermittently send\nemails with .doc malware droppers until August 2013.\n\nOn January 22, 2013, the Scarab attackers sent an email with the English-language subject\n“Joint Call For Papers - Conferences / Journal Special Issues, January 2013” to two\nindividuals. The attackers sent the message to email accounts associated with an\nAustralian-funded academic research project that had concluded in 2010. It is possible that\nthe researchers were continuing to use the email accounts for unrelated topics and this was\nwhy the attackers chose to target them. Seven days later, another email was sent to the\nsame two individuals, this time with a Russian-language subject of “Информация по\nобслуживанию высвобожденны,” which translates to “Service-related information are\nreleased” (sic).\n\n**G20 summit focus**\n\nFrom this point on, at least until January of 2014, the attackers moved to finance-related\nlures and targets. In April, the attackers sent an email with the subject “G20 receives clean\nbill of health at Boao” to a European government target.\n\nIn August, they sent another email to six people working for an international economic\norganization. This email had the Russian language subject of “G20 на 2013 г” which\ntranslates to “G20 for 2013.”\n\nIn August, a final G20-related email was sent to two individuals working in the Economic\nMinistry of a European government. That email had the English-language subject “About\nG20 details.”\n\n**Russian news lures**\n\nThere were no further emails discovered and no active infections detected until January\n2014, when Scarab’s activity resumed and continued up to now. From that month on, the\nattackers have been using “.scr” files to drop Trojan.Scieron. The titles of these .scr files are\nusually in Russian, and are a hint as to the nature of the targets. It’s very likely that the .scr\nfiles are being delivered by email; however, this has not been confirmed. It is also likely and\nagain, unconfirmed that the .scr files are embedded in .rar files.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne example of the group s malicious .scr file names is Россия к 2016 году проведет\nиспытания газовых турбин для военных кораблей.” This translates to “Russian\nFederation to 2016 will test gas turbines for warships.” The title comes from an article,\npublished in June 2014, on a Russian media website.\n\n_Figure 2. The attackers used the titles of news articles from a Russian media site for their_\n_malicious files’ names_\n\nAnother more recent file name was “план работы на июнь 2014 года.doc.scr” which\ntranslates to the quite generic “work plan for June 2014 year.doc.src.”\n\nLooking at the total number of infections per country in Figure 1 based on Symantec\ntelemetry, it’s clear that Russia, or at least Russian speakers, are the primary targets of the\nScarab attackers, although non-Russian speakers have been targeted as well.\n\n**Scarab’s malware**\n\nIn all of these campaigns, the attackers have attempted to compromise victims’ computers\nwith a variant of Trojan.Scieron. This is a basic back door threat that is used to download\nadditional malware onto the target’s computer.\n\nThe main payload of Trojan.Scieron is within a DLL file. This file is dropped either from a\nTrojanized Microsoft Word document or from other PE files.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the Trojan compromises the victim s computer, it is able to perform the following\nactions:\n\nGather system information, such as the computer name, host name, operating system\nversion, and drive type\nDownload additional files\nExecute files\nRetrieve specific files from the victim’s computer\nList directories\nDelete files\nMove files to other folders\n\nIn most of the investigated incidents, Trojan.Scieron has been used to download an\nenhanced version of itself, which Symantec detects as Trojan.Scieron.B. This threat\nincludes a basic ‘rootkit-like’ tool which hides some of its network activity.\n\nTrojan.Scieron.B’s file names seen to date are usually seclog32.dll (back door) and\nhidsvc.dat (rootkit). The back door’s functionality includes the following features:\n\nCreate, list, and terminate processes\nRead, set, and delete registry entries\nRead, write, list, and delete files and directories\nGather cached URLs\nLaunch remote shell\nGather recent active files\nRetrieve details from its configuration file\n\nTrojan.Scieron.B’s ‘rootkit’ functionality allows it to hide a Transmission Control Protocol\n(TCP) port in communications.\n\n**Symantec and Norton protection**\n\nThe Scarab attackers have been consistently targeting a select number of victims with\ncustom malware over the last few years. While the group uses older exploits, their\ncampaigns seem to have had some success, judging on how they have continued to\noperate similar campaigns over the years. The attackers’ focus on Russian speakers shows\nthat they have specific targets in mind and they continue to adjust the subject of their email\ncampaigns to successfully compromise their victims.\n\nSymantec .Cloud blocks emails that come from the Scarab attackers. Symantec and Norton\nproducts also offer the following detections against Scarab’s custom malware:\n\n[Trojan.Scieron](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-072320-5920-99)\n[Trojan.Scieron.B](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-081114-0917-99)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn general, you should adhere to the following best practices to prevent Scarab s attacks\nfrom compromising your computer:\n\nExercise caution when receiving unsolicited, unexpected, or suspicious emails.\nAvoid clicking on links in unsolicited, unexpected, or suspicious emails.\nAvoid opening attachments in unsolicited, unexpected, or suspicious emails.\nUpdate the software, operating system, and browser plugins on your computer to\nprevent attackers from exploiting known vulnerabilities.\n[Use comprehensive security software, such as Norton Security, to protect yourself](http://us.norton.com/)\nfrom malware.\n\n**Indicators of compromise (IoC)**\n\nFor a full list of IoCs, please check out [our indicators of compromise document.](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/docs/Scarab_IOCs_January_2015.txt)\n\n\n-----",
