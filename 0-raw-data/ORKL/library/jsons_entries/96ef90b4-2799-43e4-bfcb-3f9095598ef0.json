ESET has protected its\ncustomers against this threat since May 18th.\n\nHowever, we’ve been tracking the malware since December 8th, 2016, when the version\nWin32/Filecoder.AESNI.A first appeared. For the AESNI.A variant, some of the decryption\n[keys have been recently published on a BleepingComputer.com forum.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/635140/aes-ransomware-aes256-aes-ni-read-this-importanttxt-support-topic/?p=4244376)\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on ESET’s research, the ransomware appears to have been distributed through a\nUkrainian document automation system widely used in accounting. Since the infection ratio\n[is still low, a probable distribution scenario involves some kind of social engineering – e.g.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/12/30/5-things-need-know-social-engineering/)\nconnected to a malicious software update – however, it is still early to tell with absolute\ncertainty.\n\n[Once it infects a computer, the main file drops a legitimate system utility – SysInternals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysinternals)\nPsExec – and then executes the dropped ransomware sample (Win32/Filecoder.AESNI.C.).\n\nIf executed with admin privileges, the ransomware can infect an entire network. To do so, it\nuses the Mimikatz tool to extract admin credentials and then uses them to run a copy of\nitself on all computers in the internal network.\n\nIf you’re interested in why the threat is called AESNI, it is derived from the ransom note\ndropped by one of its previous variants:\n\n\n-----\n\nMoreover, there is also a functionality behind the name – the ransomware checks whether\n[the affected machine supports Advanced Encryption Standard Instruction Set, aka AES-NI.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set)\nIf that’s the case, it uses it to encrypt victims’ data faster thanks to hardware acceleration.\n\n**How to stay safe**\n\nParticularly in this case, separating admin and user accounts would prevent much of the\ndamage, as the XData ransomware misuses admin passwords if run on accounts with\nadmin privileges. Without admin privileges, XData is only able to infect one computer\ninstead of the whole network.\n\nIn general, here’s what you can do to protect yourself against most ransomware:\n\n[Use a reliable security solution that utilizes multiple layers to protect you from similar](https://www.eset.com/int/home/internet-security/)\nthreats in the future.\nMake sure to update and patch your operating system regularly.\n[Keep backups of your files on a remote hard disk or location that will not be hit in case](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/03/31/ransomware-threat-highlights-why-backing-up-data-is-essential/)\nof a network infection.\nNever click on attachments and links in suspicious or unexpected emails.\n\n23 May 2017 - 06:00PM\n\n\n-----\n\n## Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
