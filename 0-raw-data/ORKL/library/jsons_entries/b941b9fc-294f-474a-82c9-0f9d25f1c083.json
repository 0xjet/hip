Schmidt, David E. Sanger May 19, 2014\n\nContinue reading the main story\nWASHINGTON — In the Obama administration’s most direct confrontation with China over\nits theft of corporate secrets, the Justice Department on Monday unsealed an indictment of\nfive members of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army and charged them with hacking into\nthe networks of Westinghouse Electric, the United States Steel Corporation and other\ncompanies.\n\nThe indictment named members of Unit 61398, which was publicly identified last year as the\nShanghai-based cyberunit of the People’s Liberation Army, including its best-known hackers\nknown online by the noms de guerre “UglyGorilla” and “KandyGoo.”\n\nThe F.B.I. and American intelligence agencies electronically tracked the activities of the\nhackers, one official said, and “put them inside the Datong Road headquarters” of the\ncyberunit, a heavily guarded 12-floor military tower near the Shanghai airport.\n\nThe move by the Justice Department was almost certainly symbolic since there is virtually no\nchance that the Chinese would turn over the five People’s Liberation Army members named\nin the indictment.\n\n\n-----\n\nSince 2006, and as recently as last month, the indictment alleged, the hacking unit invaded\nthe networks of American corporate targets, systematically copying their emails and, in some\ncases, infecting their computers with malware.\n\nImage\n\nThe Justice Department sought to shame officials with the People’s Liberation Army by\ndisplaying wanted posters on Monday.Credit...Charles Dharapak/Associated Press\nThe indictment said that “Chinese firms hired the same P.L.A. unit” to “build a secret\ndatabase to hold corporate intelligence.” In one instance, the hackers broke into\nWestinghouse’s network to learn the company’s strategy for negotiating with one of China’s\nstate-owned enterprises. The hackers stole roughly 700,000 pages of emails, including some\nfrom its chief executive.\n\nAfter a year in which the dialogue between the two countries was derailed by Edward J.\nSnowden’s disclosures about the United States’ own spying efforts in China, the charges\nleveled by the Justice Department marked an effort by the Obama administration to return\nthe debate over to grounds they think are more favorable to the United States: intellectual\nproperty theft.\n\nUntil now, President Obama and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel have tried relatively quiet\ndiplomacy with the Chinese. They have attempted to engage the Chinese in a dialogue over\nnorms for operating in cyberspace, a careful diplomatic dance that has gone on for several\nyears. But Monday’s action by the Justice Department marked an attempt to publicly shame\nthe Liberation Army that included a “most wanted list” of cyberattackers with photographs of\nseveral marked with the Dillinger-era label “Wanted by the F.B.I.”\n\n\n-----\n\nBut it is a legal and diplomatic gamble whether this approach is more likely to halt attacks\nthat a classified American report circulated last year said were directed at more than 3,000\nAmerican companies.\n\nAt the core of the indictment is the argument that while large countries routinely spy on each\nother for national security purposes, it is out of bounds to use state-run intelligence assets to\nseek commercial advantage. “When a foreign nation uses military or intelligence resources\nand tools against an American executive or corporation to obtain trade secrets or sensitive\nbusiness information for the benefit of its state-owned companies, we must say, ‘Enough is\nenough,’ ” said Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.\n\nImage\nAttorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said that while nations routinely spy on one another for\nnational security purposes, it was out of bounds for China to use state espionage operations\nto gain commercial advantages.Credit...Evan Vucci/Associated Press\nBut the Chinese, with their vast state-owned enterprises, many run by the People’s\nLiberation Army, have often argued that economic security and national security are one, and\nthey have used Mr. Snowden’s disclosures about the National Security Agency to make the\ncase that the position of the United States is hypocritical because it also conducts attacks on\nChinese firms. One such attack on the giant Chinese telecommunication firm Huawei was\ndescribed in detail in the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, though it appeared aimed at\npenetrating Huawei’s technology in order to monitor the networks of countries that buy the\nChinese-made equipment.\n\nWithin hours of Mr. Holder’s news conference in Washington, China denounced the\nindictment, saying it was based on “fabricated facts” and that it “grossly violates the basic\nnorms governing international relations and jeopardizes China-U.S. cooperation.”\n\nIn what the Chinese suggested would be only the first step in its response to the Obama\nadministration’s action, it cut off dealing with a joint United States-China working group on\ncyberattacks that the administration has until now said was evidence that the two countries\nwere trying to resolve their differences.\n\nThe government’s case focuses on industries, like steel and solar, where trade tensions have\nbeen mounting in recent years. Rising steel and solar exports from China have created\nfriction with American companies and officials over worries that Beijing unfairly subsidizes its\ndomestic players. The indictment also described how the Chinese unit broke into the\nsystems of the United Steelworkers union, which has long pressed American officials to\ncrack down on Chinese trade practices that it views as harming American workers.\n\nThe F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said in an interview that federal authorities, who filed\nthe 31-count indictment in Pittsburgh, had not brought the charges to generate publicity.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Indictment Memorandum\n\nThe Justice Department said that the men were indicted on May 1 by a federal grand jury in\nPennsylvania and charged with conspiring to commit computer fraud and accessing a\ncomputer without authorization for the purpose of commercial advantage.\n\n“If we fabricated all this, then come over to Pittsburgh and embarrass us by forcing us to put\nup or shut up and we’ll put up,” Mr. Comey said, a reference to the fact that the targets\nnamed in the indictment were largely in Western Pennsylvania. “I welcome them to come\nover and enjoy the remarkable protections of our criminal justice system where they will have\nlawyers, the charges will have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and they will have to\nbe convicted by a 12-person jury.”\n\nIn a separate case, prosecutors also announced the arrests of 90 people in connection with\ntheir use of software called Blackshades, which allows hackers to remotely control a\ncomputer. Mr. Comey said that the cases showed that the federal government would pursue\ncybercrimes, regardless of whether they were perpetrated by groups or nations.\n\nJames A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies,\nsaid that “China will be tempted to retaliate” for Monday’s actions. He said that the Chinese\ncould punish United States firms operating in China or seek countercharges against\nAmerican officials based on the Snowden leaks, but it is unclear a broader trade war would\nbenefit either nation.\n\nIt was significant that the indictment dealt almost exclusively with Unit 61398 — also known\nas Comment Crew — but did not detail the case against another roughly 20 Chinese hacking\ngroups, some associated with the military, that the United States regularly tracks. That\nsuggested that the Obama administration may be holding other cases in reserve as leverage\nin case the Chinese retaliate.\n\nThe indictment also did not touch on Chinese attacks aimed at the Defense Department or\nmajor defense contractors, perhaps because the administration did not want to invite\nChinese revelations about American attacks on similar targets in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong\nKong.\n\n\n-----\n\nSecurity officials say Monday s indictment has been in the works for two years. A major\nchallenge, officials say, was convincing the targeted corporations to step forward. Many\nfeared loss of revenues from their operations in China or retaliation by the Chinese state.\n\n“They had to gather really strong evidence that these companies had been hacked and then\nhad to convince the companies to go public, despite fear of retaliation,” Mr. Lewis said. The\nindictment, he said, is not about what the United States will do with these hackers, but what\nChina will do with them. “The indictment is meant to send a clear public message to China\nthat they need to take action,” he said. “They need to get these P.L.A. entities under control.”\n\n\n-----",
