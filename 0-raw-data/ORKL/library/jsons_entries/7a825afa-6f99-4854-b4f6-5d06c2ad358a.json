    "plain_text": "# Microsoft takes legal action against COVID-19- related cybercrime\n\n**[blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/07/07/digital-crimes-unit-covid-19-cybercrime/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/07/07/digital-crimes-unit-covid-19-cybercrime/)**\n\nJuly 7, 2020\n\nToday, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia unsealed documents\ndetailing Microsoft’s work to disrupt cybercriminals that were taking advantage of the COVID19 pandemic in an attempt to defraud customers in 62 countries around the world. Our civil\ncase has resulted in a court order allowing Microsoft to seize control of key domains in the\ncriminals’ infrastructure so that it can no longer be used to execute cyberattacks.\n\nMicrosoft’s Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) first observed these criminals in December 2019, when\nthey deployed a sophisticated, new phishing scheme designed to compromise Microsoft\ncustomer accounts. The criminals attempted to gain access to customer email, contact lists,\nsensitive documents and other valuable information. Based on patterns discovered at that\ntime, Microsoft utilized technical means to block the criminals’ activity and disable the\nmalicious application used in the attack. Recently, Microsoft observed renewed attempts by\nthe same criminals, this time using COVID-19-related lures in the phishing emails to target\nvictims.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis malicious activity is yet another form of business email compromise (BEC) attack, which\nhas increased in complexity, sophistication and frequency in recent years. According to the\n[FBI’s 2019 Internet Crime Report, the most-costly complaints received by their Internet](https://pdf.ic3.gov/2019_IC3Report.pdf)\nCrime Complaint Center (IC3) involved BEC crimes, with losses of over $1.7 billion,\nrepresenting nearly half of all financial losses due to cybercrime. While most of the public’s\nattention in recent years has justifiably focused on the malign acts of nation state actors, the\nincreasing economic harm caused by cybercriminals must also be considered and\nconfronted by the public and private sectors. For our part, Microsoft and our Digital Crimes\nUnit will continue to investigate and disrupt cybercriminals and will seek to work with law\nenforcement agencies around the world, whenever possible, to stop these crimes.\n\nThese cybercriminals designed the phishing emails to look like they originated from an\nemployer or other trusted source and frequently targeted business leaders across a variety\nof industries, attempting to compromise accounts, steal information and redirect wire\ntransfers. When the group first began carrying out this scheme, the phishing emails\ncontained deceptive messages associated with generic business activities. For example, the\nmalicious link in the email was titled with business terms such as “Q4 Report – Dec19,” as\nseen below.\n\nBusiness-themed phishing email\n\nWith these recent efforts, however, the phishing emails instead contained messages\nregarding COVID-19 as a means to exploit pandemic-related financial concerns and induce\ntargeted victims to click on malicious links. For example, using terms such as “COVID-19\nBonus,” as seen here.\n\n\n-----\n\nCOVID-19-themed\n\nphishing email\nOnce victims clicked on the deceptive links, they were ultimately prompted to grant access\npermissions to a malicious web application (web app). Web apps are familiar-looking as they\nare widely used in organizations to drive productivity, create efficiencies and increase\nsecurity in a distributed network. Unknown to the victim, these malicious web apps were\ncontrolled by the criminals, who, with fraudulently obtained permission, could access the\nvictim’s Microsoft Office 365 account. This scheme enabled unauthorized access without\nexplicitly requiring the victims to directly give up their login credentials at a fake website or\nsimilar interface, as they would in a more traditional phishing campaign.\n\nAfter clicking through the consent prompt for the malicious web app (pictured below), the\nvictim unwittingly granted criminals permission to access and control the victims’ Office 365\naccount contents, including email, contacts, notes and material stored in the victims’\nOneDrive for Business cloud storage space and corporate SharePoint document\nmanagement and storage system.\n\n\n-----\n\nConsent screen of the malicious\n\nweb app\nMicrosoft takes many measures to monitor and block malicious web apps based on\ntelemetry indicating atypical behavior and has continued to enhance our protections based\non this activity. In cases where criminals suddenly and massively scale their activity and\nmove quickly to adapt their techniques to evade Microsoft’s built-in defensive mechanisms,\nadditional measures such as the legal action filed in this case are necessary. This unique\ncivil case against COVID-19-themed BEC attacks has allowed us to proactively disable key\ndomains that are part of the criminals’ malicious infrastructure, which is a critical step in\nprotecting our customers.\n\nAs [we’ve observed, cybercriminals have been adapting their lures to take advantage of](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/06/16/exploiting-a-crisis-how-cybercriminals-behaved-during-the-outbreak/)\ncurrent events, using COVID-19-related themes to deceive victims. While the lures may have\nchanged, the underlying threats remain, evolve and grow, and it’s more important than ever\nto remain vigilant against cyberattacks.\n\nTo further protect yourself against phishing campaigns, including BEC, we recommend, first,\nthat you enable two-factor authentication on all business and personal email accounts.\n[Second, learn how to spot phishing schemes and protect yourself from them.
