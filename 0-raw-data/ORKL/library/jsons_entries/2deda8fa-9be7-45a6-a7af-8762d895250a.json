An example of such an email was uploaded to\nVirusTotal on August 22nd, two days after the mail was delivered. An overview of the attack vector was\n[recently published by Telsy TRT.](https://blog.telsy.com/zebrocy-dropbox-remote-injection)\n\nHowever, we have some further pieces of this puzzle that could help to draw a more complete picture of\nthe campaign.\n\n[As predicted by other fellow researchers, the Sednit group added a new development language in their](https://securelist.com/zebrocys-multilanguage-malware-salad/90680/)\ntoolset — more precisely, for their downloader: the Nim language. However, their developers were also\nbusy improving their Golang downloader, as well as rewriting their backdoor from Delphi into Golang.\n\n## A complicated compromise\n\nFigure 1 depicts the different steps leading to a victim being compromised, from the malicious email\ninitially received in the inbox to the backdoor deployed on targets deemed “interesting enough” by the\noperators.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Chain of compromise overview_\n\nWhen a victim is targeted by Zebrocy’s components, the chain is usually quite loud. Loud because, in this\ncase, the victim has at least six malicious components dropped on the computer before the final payload\nis executed. Such activities can easily raise different types of flags for a security product.\n\nThe document attached to the phishing email is blank, but references a remote template, wordData.dotm,\nhosted at Dropbox. Opening this document in Word causes it to download wordData.dotm, as seen in\nFigure 2, and to incorporate it into the associated document’s working environment, including any active\n\n\n-----\n\ncontent the template may contain.\n\n_Figure 2. Empty word document downloading a remote template_\n\nThe wordData.dotm file contains malicious macros that then are executed. (Depending on the Microsoft\nWord version, the VBA macros may be disabled by default; if so, user action is required to enable them.)\nIt also contains an embedded ZIP archive that the macros dropped and extracted.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, the macros in wordData.dotm open another document (lmss.doc that was\nunpacked from the archive extracted from wordData.dotm). Macros in lmss.doc execute lmss.exe\n(Zebrocy’s new Nim downloader, also extracted from the archive embedded in wordData.dotm) instead of\nwordData.dotm executing the downloader directly.\n\nHowever, it’s important to notice that lmss.doc, containing the VBA code that executes the new Nim\ndownloader, also embeds a base64-encoded executable. According to its Document Properties,\nlmss.doc was created in January 2019 and modified on August 20, a few hours before the campaignth\nstarted.\n\n_Figure 3. Creation and last modification dates of lmss.doc_\n\nThe executable embedded in lmss.doc is an AutoIt downloader (SHA-1:\n6b300486d17d07a02365d32b673cd6638bd384f3) used in the past for a campaign performed around the\ncreation time of lmss.doc. Here, the AutoIt downloader is ignored and doesn’t have any purpose other\nthan making the size of the document bigger. The operator probably forgot to remove the previous\nembedded downloader – it would not be the first time that Sednit operators have made mistakes.\n\n## The downloaders\n\nSednit operators have used several downloaders written in different languages. This campaign uses the\n[most recent extension of that list – a downloader written in the relatively new language, Nim. It’s a](https://nim-lang.org/)\nstraightforward download-and-execute binary with two small details added. The first is probably used as\nan anti-sandbox trick and it checks that the first letter of the executed file (letter l here or 0x6C in hex)\nhas not changed.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Filename check_\n\nThe second is a kind of obfuscation where the operator replaces placeholder letters in a string with the\ncorrect ones, at defined offsets. As seen in Figure 5, the downloader reconstructs the correct download\nURL string with this method to avoid basic static analysis tools that could otherwise locate the URL\nstring.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Hex-Rays output of the strings deobfuscation_\n\nFor example, the string o-ps-c..ll is “patched” at three offsets by s, v and d, respectively, to give\nospsvc.dll. In the case of the URL, since the beginning of the string in the downloader is h@@p://, tools\nlooking for http:// won’t catch it.\n\nThe Nim downloader fetches its dynamic-link library (DLL) payload, named ospsvc.dll, to\nC:\\ProgramData\\Java\\Oracle\\, and executes it as a service via regsvr32 /s.\n\n[ospsvc.dll is a downloader written in Golang, and different from other Sednit downloaders seen in the](https://golang.org/)\npast.\n\nSednit’s previous Golang downloaders have been described in detail by other researchers [1][2][3] and it\nseems that Sednit’s developers have rewritten their previous Delphi downloader in Golang. Those earlier\ndownloaders gather a lot of information about the victim computer and send it to their C&C server.\nHowever, this new one is quite light in terms of its data-gathering capabilities, as described below.\n\n\n-----\n\nIts function main_init() contains libraries that are initialized and don t need further explanations due to\n[their names (see this article for more information).](https://www.vkremez.com/2018/12/lets-learn-dissecting-apt28sofacy.html)\n\n_Figure 6. Hex-Rays output of initialized functions in the main_init() using the IDAGolangHelper plugin_\n\nSince the DLL is run as a service, via the Nim downloader, we need to look at main_DllRegisterServer()\ninstead of main_main(). The strings and the key are stacked and they can be decrypted using a simple\nXOR loop. This simple encryption is quite efficient against tools that extract strings stacked from binaries\nstatically.\n\n_Figure 7. IDA Pro output of encrypted strings stacked_\n\nAside from downloading the next stage of the malware, taking screenshots of the victim’s desktop and\nexecuting commands received from the C&C server are the main functions of this malware.\n\nScreenshots are taken every 35 seconds during the first few minutes of this downloader’s execution, and\nthen they are sent to the C&C server in base64-encoded form. The hostname and the\n%USERPROFILE% values are also sent to the C&C server encoded in base64. The reply from the C&C\nserver is also straightforward: it’s a concatenation of base64 encoded strings separated by “|”\n\n\n-----\n\n<spaces>|<cmd to execute>|<name of the binary to drop>|<binary to drop>\n\nAccording to our telemetry, this downloader has been used to execute three different pieces of malware.\n[The first one is the dumper that we described in our previous Zebrocy article. The second one is the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/05/22/journey-zebrocy-land/)\nusual Delphi backdoor – also run as a service via the same command used by the Nim downloader. The\nthird one we saw is a new backdoor downloaded and executed on the victim’s machine, as described in\nthe next section.\n\n# The new backdoor\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe new Zebrocy backdoor is not written in Delphi as we are used to, but in Golang. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first time this backdoor has been seen, but it shares a lot of similarities with the\nDelphi one.\n\nBy looking again at the main_init() function’s library initialization code (Figure 8) we can see new entries.\nAn AES algorithm, hex encoding, and screenshot capabilities are the main entries that were added.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Diff between the backdoor and the downloader functions initialized in the main_init()_\n\n\n-----\n\nNotice that image_png_init replaces image_jpeg_init for taking screenshots. Images in JPG format are\nusually smaller in size than the PNG format.\n\nThe backdoor is started with an argument that is a hex-encoded string. All but the last six-byte chunk of\nthis string is XOR-encrypted with the key stored in the last six bytes of the string. The following python\nsnippet describes the decryption logic.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\nkey = arg[-6:].decode('hex')\n\nenc = arg[:-6].decode('hex')\n\n''.join(chr(ord(i) ^ ord(j)) for i, j in zip(itertools.cycle(key), enc))\n\n\nIt’s the address of the C&C server, which is later encrypted and stored on disk. That encryption is done\nusing the AES-128 ECB algorithm with a key generated from the hostname. Hence, there is no possibility\nto obtain this C&C server just by looking at the binary. There is no persistence defined by the\ndownloaders as we have seen in the past, nor does the backdoor have any persistence mechanism.\n\nThis new backdoor has various capabilities that were also previously seen in Zebrocy’s Delphi backdoor:\n\nfile manipulation such as creation, modification, and deletion\nscreenshot capabilities\ndrive enumeration\ncommand execution (via cmd.exe)\nschedule a task under the following name Windows\\Software\\OSDebug (which the operators could\nuse to set persistence manually)\n\nAs in the Delphi backdoor, there is a very limited set of commands – but the ability to execute arbitrary\ncommands via cmd.exe extends possibilities like persistence or information gathering. Another similarity\nfound is a three-digit version number (in the format x.y.z); the current major version is 4.y.z.\n\n## Network\n\nThe network protocol shares some similarities with the Delphi version of the backdoor. The first\ninteraction with the C&C server retrieves an AES 32-bit key to encrypt future communications. The\npacket capture of that first request looks like this:\n\nPOST [REDACTED URI] HTTP/1.1\n\nHost: [REDACTED IP]\n\nUser-Agent: Go-http-client/1.1\n\nContent-Length: 297\n\nContent‑Type: multipart/form‑data; boundary=b116f1e0a94eff1bb406531e74bb0feba65687cf90ec8a64fc409f230fbd\n\nAccept-Encoding: gzip\n\n–b116f1e0a94eff1bb406531e74bb0feba65687cf90ec8a64fc409f230fbd\n\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=”filename”; filename=”[REDACTED]”\n\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n\n1\n\n–b116f1e0a94eff1bb406531e74bb0feba65687cf90ec8a64fc409f230fbd–\n\nThose with experience with Sednit might think that the Content-Disposition and boundary keywords look\n[familiar They were previously used by the Delphi backdoor in its network protocol; it also uses the AES](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/24/sednit-update-analysis-zebrocy/)\n\n\n-----\n\nalgorithm to encrypt the pseudo body (content after the Content-Type data). Notice that even if ContentDisposition and the second instance of Content-Type are real HTTP headers, here they are used inside\nthe HTTP message body. The boundary field is randomized for every exchange and the filename field\ninside the pseudo Content‑Disposition header can be decrypted with the following snippet of Python:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\nlen_filename = len(filename)\n\nlen_key = 14\n\nxor_key = filename[-len_key:].decode('hex')\n\nfilename = filename[:len_filename-len_key].decode('hex')\n\nval_filename = ''.join(chr(ord(i)^ord(j)) for i,j in zip(itertools.cycle(xor_key),filename))\n\nrandom_int = val_filename[-4:]\n\n\nwhich results in the following string:\n\n757365722D504318162020190821151055207C.inc\n\nThat string can be further understood thus:\n\nUsername: 757365722D5043\nSID*: 181620\nDate: 20190821151055\nRandom: 207C.inc\n\n- 6 bytes comes from the current user’s Security Identifiers (SID) S-1-521‑xxxxxxxxx‑yyyyyyyyyy‑zzzzzzzzzz‑1000\n\nFurther interactions with the C&C server follow this pattern except that the pseudo body, which is 1 in the\nexample above, is replaced by the output of the command requested by the C&C server. The full\nmessage body is also encrypted, using the same AES algorithm used previously, with the key provided in\nthe first exchange.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNew downloaders, new backdoor – the Sednit group has been active and is not letting their components\nget too old. New? Not really. By looking at it, it seems that the Sednit group is porting the original code to,\nor reimplementing it in, other languages in the hope of evading detection. It’s probably easier that way\nand it means they do not need to change their entire TTPs. The initial compromise vector stays\nunchanged, but using a service like Dropbox to download a remote template is unusual for the group.\n\nESET recommends being attentive when users are opening attachments from suspicious emails.\n\nWe will continue to monitor new activities from the Sednit group and will publish relevant information on\nour blog.
