It steals browsing history,](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actors-using-legitimate-paypal-accounts-to-distribute-chthonic-banking-trojan)\ncookies, ID/passwords, cryptocurrency information, and more. Based on its configuration\n[settings, it can also behave as a downloader. In this blog, we investigate AZORult v3.2 and](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/new-version-azorult-stealer-improves-loading-features-spreads-alongside)\n[v3.3[2],[3]. According to ANY.RUN, AZORult](https://research.checkpoint.com/the-emergence-of-the-new-azorult-3-3/) [ranked as a Top 10 threat from October 2018 to](https://twitter.com/anyrun_app)\nDecember 2018 [4].\n\n\nExploit kits and phishing emails are major infection vectors for this threat. Other malware\n[families such as Ramnit and Emotet also download AZORult. This report details our threat](https://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/cylance-vs-emotet-infostealer-malware.html)\nresearch team’s recent technical observations of AZORult.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nAZORult is an infostealer malware. Its general behavior is summarized in Figure 1. Once a\nvictim's computer is infected, the malware exfiltrates sensitive data. First, AZORult\ngenerates a unique ID of the victim's computer and applies XOR encryption using the\ngenerated ID. A masked ID is used for the initial request to command and control (C2)\nservers.\n\nC2 servers respond with configuration data which contains target web browser names, web\nbrowser path information, API names, sqlite3 queries, and legitimate DLLs. AZORult then\nharvests sensitive information from the victim's computer according to rules set by its\n\n\n-----\n\nconfiguration data. The collected information is packed and XORed. AZORult can also\ndownload and run additional programs. We did not observe any anti-analysis code in\nAZORult’s malware files:\n\n_Figure 1: AZORult attack cycle_\n\n## ID Generation\n\nOnce AZORult runs in the victim's environment, it generates a unique ID from the following\ndata (see Figure 2):\n\nMachine GUID\nProduct name\nUsername\nComputer name\nA packed archive file containing the above information\n\n_Figure 2: ID generation_\n\nEach value is acquired with Win32 APIs and registry calls, and converted to 4-byte values\nwith the following function:\n\ndef IDgeneration(plaintext, key):\n\nbytetext = bytearray(plaintext.encode('ascii'))\n\nlength = len(bytetext)\n\ntmp = 0\n\nfor i in range(0, length):\n\nxoredValue = bytetext[i] ^ key\n\nxoredValue += tmp\n\nxoredValue &= 0xFFFFFFFF\n\ntmp1 = xoredValue >> 19\n\ntmp2 = (xoredValue << 13) & 0xFFFFFFFF\n\ntmp = xoredValue - (tmp1 | tmp2) & 0xFFFFFFFF\n\nreturn tmp\n\nA 4-byte XOR key, 0x6521458A, is passed to the function as well. The same XOR mask is\nused in AZORult v3.2 and v3.3. Then, all 4-bytes data are concatenated with a hyphen. The\ngenerated ID is used for two purposes:\n\nTo create a mutex\nTo provide a unique id for the C2 communication\n\n\n-----\n\n## Command and Control Communication\n\nAZORult attempts to convert the generated ID as follows:\n\nAppend a prefix: \"G\" for AZORult v3.2 and 3-byte XOR key for AZORult v3.3\nURL encoded\nXOR mask\n\nThe converted ID is used for the initial C2 communication. AZORult sends an initial request\nto its C2 server to receive configuration data. The configuration data format is described in\nFigure 3:\n\n_Figure 3: Configuration data format (v3.3)_\n\nThe configuration data has three types of content:\n\n**1. Web browser path information, email client software, hardcoded sqlite3 queries,**\n**etc.**\nSee Figure 4 for excerpted configuration data.\nAZORult utilizes this information to scan victim's machines and steal sensitive data:\n\n_Figure 4: Excerpted configuration data of this part_\n\n**2. Commands from the C2 servers**\nCommands are also in the configuration data. See Figure 5 as an example:\n\n**_-F_**\nAZORult to upload additional files\n**_-I_**\nAZORult to send geolocation of IP addresses of victim machines\n**_-L_**\nAZORult to download and run files\n\n_Figure 5: Command list example_\n\n**3. Legitimate DLLs**\nThese are used for stealing sensitive information on victim computers:\n\napi-ms-win-core-console-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-datetime-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-debug-l1-1-0.dll\n\n\n-----\n\napi-ms-win-core-errorhandling-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-file-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-file-l1-2-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-file-l2-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-handle-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-heap-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-interlocked-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-libraryloader-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-localization-l1-2-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-memory-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-namedpipe-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-processenvironment-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-processthreads-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-processthreads-l1-1-1.dll\napi-ms-win-core-profile-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-rtlsupport-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-string-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-synch-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-synch-l1-2-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-sysinfo-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-timezone-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-core-util-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-crt-conio-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-crt-convert-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-crt-environment-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-crt-filesystem-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-crt-heap-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-crt-locale-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-crt-math-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-crt-multibyte-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-crt-private-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-crt-process-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-crt-stdio-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-crt-string-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-crt-time-l1-1-0.dll\napi-ms-win-crt-utility-l1-1-0.dll\nfreebl3.dll\nmozglue.dll\nmsvcp140.dll\nnss3.dll\nnssdbm3.dll\n\n\n-----\n\nsoftokn3.dll\nucrtbase.dll\nvcruntime140.dll\n\n## How AZORult Steals Victim's Sensitive Information\n\nAZORult scans the victim’s environment looking to steal personal information such as\npasswords, cookies, browsing history, and more. This section explains how the malware\ngrabs password information saved in the victim’s Google Chrome browser:\n\n**1. Search target file:**\n\nIn the case of Google Chrome, password information is saved in\n_%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data. (The path is_\nconstructed by the information in the configuration data)\n\n**2. Copy the file “Login Data” to %TEMP%:**\n\nThe destination filename in %TEMP% contains digits constructed with the result data of\n_GetTickCount() and QueryPerformanceCounter() as shown in Figure 6:_\n\n_Figure 6: A temporary file of copied “Login Data”_\n\n**3. Run sqlite3 query:**\n\nThe file “Login Data” is SQLite 3.x database code. To query sqllite3 data, AZORult reads\nthe configuration data to load a dll (in this case, “nss3.dll”). It also loads the sqllite3 query\ndata, then runs the query to extract sensitive information. Once the data is extracted,\nAZORult saves the information as shown in Figure 7:\n\n_Figure 7: AZORult saves stolen password information with this format_\n\n**4. Delete copied “Login Data” from %TEMP% directory.**\n\nBased on our analysis, AZORult tries to get sensitive information from these programs:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Web Browser:**\no  Google Chrome\no  Comodo Dragon\no  Amigo\no  Orbitum\no  Bromium\no  Chromium\no  Nichrome\no  RockMelt\no  Vivaldi\no  Go Browser\no  Sputnik\no  Kometa\no  Uran\no  QIP Surf\no  Epic Privacy Browser\no  Brave\no  Cent Browser\no  CocCoc\no  7 Star\no  Elements Browser\no  Safer Technologies\no  Mustang\no  Superbird\no  Chedot\no  Torch\no  Firefox\no  Waterfox\no  IceDragon\no  Cyberfox\no  PaleMoon\no  InternetExplorer\no  Microsoft Edge\no  Opera\no  Xpom\no  YandexBrowser\no  360Browser\no  TorBro\no  Suhba\n\n\n-----\n\n**E-mail client:**\no  Outlook\no  Thunderbird\n\n**Cryptocurrency:**\no  Electrum\no  Electrum-LTC\no  ElectrumG\no  Electrum-btcp\no  Jaxx\no  MultiBitHD\no  Monero\no  Bitcoin\no  BitcoinGold\no  BitCore\no  Litecoin\no  BitcoinABC\no  Exodus\no  Exodus Eden\no  Ethereum\n\n**Others:**\no  Filezilla\no  PSI+\no  WinScp\no  Skype\no  Telegram\no  Steam\n\n## Data Format to C2 Server\n\nAZORult collects sensitive data from victim machines and sends it to C2 servers. We\nconfirmed several types of data sent to C2 servers including:\n\nBasic information of victim's computers such as OS version\nPassword information saved by web browsers\nDomain name lists accessed by web browser\nAuto-complete, cookies, and browsing history of web browser\nC2 command result\nInfected host IP address information\nScreenshots of victim host\n\n\n-----\n\nDetailed system information\no Display resolution\no Running process tree\no Installed program list\no Others\n\nThe data is packed and a hardcoded separator is added, as shown in Figure 8. Hardcoded\nseparators differ between v3.2 and v3.3. Before the packed data is sent to C2 servers it is\nXOR masked:\n\n_Figure 8: Packed Information (separator is grayed-out)_\n\nZip data contains some files and folders as shown in Figure 9:\n\n_Figure 9: Files and folders in zip data_\n\n## Loader Function\n\nAZORult may be configured to download and run additional payloads. It saves the malicious\nfiles under %TEMP% or %ProgramFiles%. AZORult checks the extension of downloaded\nfiles and if it finds “.exe”, it runs them via CreateProcessW() as shown in Figure 10.\nOtherwise, it calls ShellExecuteW(). During our investigation, we found\nhXXp://cindysonam[.]org/putty[.]exe. The file was digitally signed and legitimate putty.exe\n[v0.68. However, the URL also distributed a banking Trojan, Panda Banker: [1],[2]](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/url/72898/)\n\n_Figure 10: AZORult checks extension of downloaded file,_\n\n_then it is run via CreateProcessW or ShellExecuteW_\n\n## Administrator Panel\n\nBlackberry Cylance discovered a builder website and the administrator panel web\napplication. The description, which highlighted several AZORult improvements, was written\nin Russian:\n\n_Figure 11: A screenshot of builder website of AZORult_\n\nThe administrator panel is designed for showing information captured from victim\ncomputers. On the top page it displays statistics of stolen information and the countries of\nvictims:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12: Top page of administrator panel_\n\nAdministrators can edit stealer config to specify information they want to steal and include\nadditional malware samples. AZORult will receive these administrator preferences as\nconfiguration data:\n\n_Figure 13: AZORult’s stealer config menu_\n\n## Blackberry Cylance Blocks AZORult\n\nThreat actors use AZORult to steal system information, browsing history, cookies,\nIDs/passwords saved in browsers, cryptocurrency information and more. Though AZORult\ndoes not currently implement anti-analysis measures, we suspect it will in the future.\n\n[Blackberry Cylance uses artificial intelligence-based agents trained for threat detection on](http://cylance.com/en-us/platform/products/index.html)\nmillions of both safe and unsafe files. This allows Blackberry Cylance to spot a threat based\non countless file attributes instead of a specific file signature to block AZORult.
