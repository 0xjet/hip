The group has been active since at least 2010 and has historically\ntargeted government and diplomatic entities across North and South America, Africa and the\nMiddle East.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn June 2021, ESET [reported that this group had upgraded their tool kit to include a new](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/06/10/backdoordiplomacy-upgrading-quarian-turian/)\nbackdoor called Turian. This backdoor remains under active development and we assess that\nit is used exclusively by Playful Taurus actors. Following the evolution of this capability, we\nrecently identified new variants of this backdoor as well as new command and control\ninfrastructure. Analysis of both the samples and connections to the malicious infrastructure\nsuggests that several Iranian government networks have likely been compromised by Playful\nTaurus.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers receive protections from the threats described in this blog\nthrough [Advanced URL Filtering,](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-url-filtering) [DNS Security,](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/dns-security) [Cortex XDR and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr) [WildFire malware analysis.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire)\n\n\n**Names for Threat Actor Group**\n**Discussed**\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nPlayful Taurus Infrastructure\n\nObserved Activity\n\nInside the Wire\n\nTurian Backdoor\n\nTechical Analysis\n\nThe Turian Link\n\nAn Updated Variant\n\nConclusion\n\nProtections and Mitigations\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n## Playful Taurus Infrastructure\n\n\nPlayful Taurus, APT15, BackdoorDiplomacy, Vixen\nPanda, NICKEL\n\n\nIn 2021, the domain vpnkerio[.]com was [identified as part of a Playful Taurus campaign](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/06/10/backdoordiplomacy-upgrading-quarian-turian/)\ntargeting diplomatic entities and telecommunications companies across Africa and the Middle\nEast. Since then, this domain and its associated subdomains have shifted hosting to several\nnew IP addresses. Notably, several of the subdomains currently resolve to 152.32.181[.]16.\n\n[Analyzing this IP, we identified an expired X.509 certificate that appeared to be associated](https://sectigo.com/resource-library/what-is-x509-certificate)\nwith Senegal’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), CN=diplosen.gouv[.]sn.\n\n**Suspected Playful Taurus X509**\n**Certificate**\n\n**SHA-1** cfd9884511f2b5171c00570da837c31094e2ec72\n\n\n-----\n\n**Issued** 2020-04-23\n\n**Expires** 2021-04-29\n\n**Common Name** diplosen.gouv[.]sn\n\n**Organization Name** DigiCert, Inc.\n\n**SSL Version** 3\n\n**Locality** Dakar\n\n**Country** SN\n\n_Table 1. Suspected Playful Taurus certificate._\n\nDespite expiring in April 2021, this certificate continued to be associated with recent\ninfrastructure. For example, this certificate was first observed on 152.32.181[.]16 in April 2022,\na full year after it had expired. Coincidentally, that same month, subdomains for\nvpnkerio[.]com began resolving to this IP.\n\nExploring all IP associations with this certificate, we found that this certificate was initially\nassociated with what we assess is likely legitimate Senegal government infrastructure. This\nassociation remained consistent until the expiration of the certificate in April 2021. Following\nits expiration, this certificate has been associated with nine different IP addresses. Eight of\nthose nine IPs have hosted Playful Taurus domains.\n\n## Observed Activity\n\nMonitoring connections to the malicious infrastructure, we observed the following four Iranian\norganizations attempting to connect to 152.32.181[.]16 between July and late December\n2022.\n\n**Iranian Connections to Playful Taurus**\n**Infrastructure**\n\n**IP Address** **Organization**\n\n109.201.27[.]66 Iranian Government Infrastructure\n\n185.4.17[.]10 Foreign Ministry of Iran Infrastructure\n\n\n37.156.28[.]101\n\n37.156.29[.]172\n\n\nSuspected Iranian Government\nInfrastructure\n\n\n31.47.62[.]201 Iranian Natural Resource Organization\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 2. Iranian connections to Playful Taurus infrastructure._\n\nThe sustained daily nature of these connections to Playful Taurus controlled infrastructure\nsuggests a likely compromise of these networks. Moreover, these targets also fit historical\ntargeting patterns by the group.\n\n### Inside the Wire\n\nWhile researching the Iranian infrastructure in Table 2, we found that the first IP\n(109.201.27[.]66) hosted what appears to be a legitimate Foreign Ministry of Iran domain\n(pro.mfa[.]ir) between May and November 2019. This IP also resides on a netblock that hosts\nother Iranian government domains.\n\nHowever, since September 2021, this IP has hosted the domain mfaantivirus[.]xyz. The use of\nthe .xyz top level domain (TLD) seems odd for an IP and netblock that hosts legitimate Iranian\ngovernment domains.\n\nThe registration record for mfaantivirus[.]xyz shows that it was registered by an organization\nthat has only registered eight other domains. Three of those domains, including\nmfaantivirus[.]xyz, stand out for being hosted on Iranian government netblocks. The two\nadditional domains hosted on Iranian government infrastructure are as follows.\n\n**Registration Organization Overlap**\n\n**IP** **Domain** **Owner**\n\n109.201.27[.]67 pfs1010[.]xyz Foreign Ministry of Iran\n_Reverse PTR: cp.econsular[.]ir_\n\n109.201.19[.]184 pfs1010[.]com Foreign Ministry of Iran\n\nTable 3. Domains sharing a registering organization with mfaantivirus[.]xyz.\n\nThe first IP in Table 3 contains a reverse DNS pointer to cp.econsular[.]ir, and the second IP’s\nnetname is “Foreign Ministry of Iran.” This suggests that both are affiliated with the Iranian\ngovernment.\n\nThat said, further analysis of these IPs revealed associations with two X.509 certificates. The\nearliest certificate appears to be related to pfSense and was only associated with these IPs for\na single day in August 2019. This leads us to believe that the two pfs1010.* domains are\nmade to resemble pfSense firewalls. The use of the domain name mfaantivirus[.]xyz loosely\nfits the security theme as well.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second certificate associated with the IPs in Table 3 is a self-signed certificate with a\ncommon name of www.netgate[.]com. Netgate is the doing business as (DBA) name for\nRubicon Communications, who developed pfSense – again sticking with the pfSense theme.\nBelow is the information associated with that certificate.\n\n**Netgate X.509 Certificate**\n\n**SHA-1** 1cf1985aec3dd1f7040d8e9913d9286a52243aca\n\n**Issued** 2022-04-21\n\n**Expires** 2032-04-18\n\n**Common Name** www.netgate[.]com\n\n**Organization Name** netgate\n\n**SSL Version** 1\n\n**Locality** New York\n\n**State/Province** New York\n\n**Country** United States\n\nTable 4. Second suspected Playful Taurus certificate.\n\nThere are five additional malicious IPs associated with this certificate, but the two we wish to\nhighlight are the following.\n\n**X509 Certificate Two - IP Associations**\n\n**IP** **Owner**\n\n151.248.24[.]251 NYNEX satellite OHG\nPrevious Cert: portal-Share.mfa[.]new\n\n158.247.222[.]6 Constant Company VPS\n\nTable 5. X509 certificate two – IP associations.\n\nThe first IP contains a historical certificate reference to portal-Share.mfa[.]new, which\nsuggests an ambiguous “Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)” nexus. The second is a virtual\nprivate server (VPS) owned by The Constant Company. This second IP (158.247.222[.]6)\nhosted the domain www[.]delldrivers[.]in from July 7, 2022 to Oct. 11, 2022. This domain is\nassociated with a Turian backdoor sample.\n\n\n-----\n\nTying this all together, we identified Iranian government infrastructure establishing connections\nwith a known Playful Taurus command and control (C2) server. Pivoting on one of the Iranian\ngovernment IPs, we then identified additional infrastructure hosting certificates that overlap\nwith a second Playful Taurus C2 server.\n\n## Turian Backdoor\n\nAnalyzing the domain *.delldrivers[.]in resulted in the identification of the following sample of\nmalware.\n\n**File Details**\n\n**Filename** dellux[.]exe\n\n\n**Creation**\n**Time**\n\n\n2022-06-27 01:25:26 UTC\n\n\n**SHA256** 67c911510e257b341be77bc2a88cedc99ace2af852f7825d9710016619875e80\n\n**Connections** update.delldrivers[.]in\n\nTable 6. File details for Turian sample.\n\nThis sample was uploaded to VirusTotal from submitters in Iran on Nov. 12 and 13, 2022. We\nfurther observed that these same submitters uploaded files and URLs that suggest a likely\naffiliation with Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n### Technical Analysis\n\n[We found that this sample is packed with VMProtect. However, the final payload is not](https://vmpsoft.com/)\nvirtualized and is ultimately unpacked into the .text, .data and .rdata sections of the payload.\nUnfortunately, VMProtect obfuscates all API calls within the sample. So whenever an API call\nis made, execution jumps to the .vmp0 section to resolve the import and execute it.\n\nWhile the functionality of the sample becomes increasingly difficult to analyze due to the API\nobfuscation, the strings within the unpacked .data section provide a useful pivot point for\nidentifying additional samples that contain the same functionality but are not packed with\nVMProtect.\n\nAlongside the strings, the sample also contains a fairly unique XOR decryption function\n(shown in Figure 1). This is used to decrypt the embedded C2 server, update.delldrivers[.]in.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Fairly unique decryption algorithm.\n\n[A similar algorithm has been seen within the Neshta file infector, back in 2014. Data encrypted](https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2014/08/bird-s-nest)\nwith this algorithm can be decrypted with the Python snippet shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Python data decryptor.\n\nPivoting on the algorithm’s byte pattern {69 D2 05 84 08 08 8A 1C 30 42 32 DA 88 1C 30}\nallows us to identify two additional malware samples.\n\n**File Details**\n\n**Filename** scm[.]exe\n\n**Type** EXE\n\n\n**Creation**\n**Time**\n\n\n2022-04-28 02:56:26 UTC\n\n\n**SHA256** 8549c5bafbfad6c7127f9954d0e954f9550d9730ec2e06d6918c050bf3cb19c3\n\n**Connections** scm.oracleapps[.]org\n\nTable 7.

File details of the second sample located via pivoting on algorithm byte pattern.\n\n### The Turian Link\n\nAside from the C2 infrastructure being very similar in naming convention, comparing the code\nbases of these samples to the unpacked VMProtect sample indicates clear overlap between\nthe functionality.\n\nDue to the almost identical code base, we opted to focus our analysis on the executable,\nrather than the DLL. Before doing so, we had a look at the DLL and noticed several cleartext\nstrings.\n\nSearching for samples with similar strings, we identified two additional samples.\n\n**File Details**\n\n**Type** DLL\n\n\n**Creation**\n**Time**\n\n\n2022-04-28 02:56:26 UTC\n\n\n**SHA256** 5bb99755924ccb6882fc0bdedb07a482313daeaaa449272dc291566cd1208ed5\n\n**Connections** 127.0.0.1\n\nTable 9.

File details of the second sample located via pivoting on registry strings.\n\nThese samples have been tagged in VirusTotal as being APT_MAL_LNX_Turian_Jun21_1,\nwhich is a Linux version of the Turian backdoor. However, these samples are clearly not for\nLinux systems. This tag did point us toward previous reporting on the Turian/Quarian\nbackdoors, which established a link between our dellux.exe sample and Turian.\n\n### An Updated Variant\n\nKey differences between our samples and the previously documented Turian samples\nindicated that we were likely looking at a newer version, with some additional obfuscation and\na modified network protocol.\n\nThe first key difference was the C2 decryption algorithm. In prior Turian samples, the C2s\nwere decrypted with an XOR against a hard coded byte, such as 0xA9.\n\nWhereas in the dellux.exe sample, the algorithm has clearly been updated.\n\nAdditionally, the network protocol in use by Turian and Quarian backdoors has historically\nbeen very distinct, especially during the initial key exchange. In this variant, the network\nprotocol has been altered to instead make use of the Security Support Provider Interface\n(SSPI).\n\nOn startup, Turian will retrieve a pointer to the SSPI Dispatch Table via a call to\nInitSecurityInterfaceA(), before calling AcquireCredentialsHandleA(). A socket is then opened\nto the remote C2, using standard Winsock API, with connect() being called to establish a\nconnection.\n\nOnce a connection has been made, Turian then performs an SSL handshake with the C2.\nThis is done through a call to InitializeSecurityContextA(), which will return a token to send to\nthe C2 server.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce sent, Turian waits for a 5 byte response (the SSL/TLS record header). This response\ncontains the length of data also to be received from the C2 server, after the initial header. The\nremaining data is then passed into another call to InitializeSecurityContextA(), before\nreturning. At this point, the handshake has been successful and secure communications can\nbegin.\n\nAll packets sent to the C2 server are encrypted using the EncryptMessage() API, but are also\nXORed with the key 0x56 beforehand. The same functionality is performed on received\npackets, with the data being decrypted with DecryptMessage(), followed by XORing with 0x56.\n\nThe updated backdoor offers fairly generic functionality, from updating the C2 to communicate\nwith, to executing commands and spawning reverse shells. The main differences with this\ncompared to other variants of Turian are the command IDs. Whereas before, the IDs started\nat 0x01 and followed an order, the IDs in this variant appear to be randomized.\n\n**Commands Table**\n\n0xBC5B Clean up\n\n0xA8CB Update C2\n\n0x9D58 Execute Command\n\n0x9A3C Spawn File Explorer Thread\n\n0x7C0D (Unknown)\n\n0x6394 Set Flag\n\n0x74D2 (Unknown)\n\n0x53A6 Get System Info\n\n0x26CD Spawn Reverse Shell Thread\n\nTable 11. Updated Turian commands.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPlayful Taurus continues to evolve their tactics and their tooling. Recent upgrades to the\nTurian backdoor and new C2 infrastructure suggest that these actors continue to see success\nduring their cyber espionage campaigns. Our analysis of the samples and connections to the\nmalicious infrastructure suggest that Iranian government networks have likely been\ncompromised. At the same time, we would also caution that Playful Taurus routinely deploys\nthe same tactics and techniques against other government and diplomatic entities across\nNorth and South America, Africa and the Middle East.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Palo Alto Networks has shared these findings, including file samples and indicators of_\n_compromise, with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) members.
