such as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, etc- of the Dukes, a well-resourced, highly\ndedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect\n\n\n-----\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group\nthat we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect\nintelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making.\n\nThe Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government\nministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have\nalso included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States; Asian,\nAfrican, and Middle Eastern governments; organizations associated with Chechen extremism; and\nRussian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs.\n\nThe Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke,\nCosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke, PinchDuke,\nand GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large-scale\nspear-phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with\ngovernmental institutions and affiliated organizations.\n\nThese campaigns utilize a smash-and-grab approach involving a fast but noisy break- in followed\nby the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible. If the compromised target\nis discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using\nstealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long-term intelligence gathering.\n\nIn addition to these large-scale campaigns, the Dukes continuously and concurrently engage\nin smaller, much more targeted campaigns, utilizing\ndifferent toolsets. These targeted campaigns have been\n\n#### the Dukes show unusual\n\ngoing on for at least 7 years. The targets and timing of\nthese campaigns appear to align with the known foreign confidence in their ability\nand security policy interests of the Russian Federation at to continue successfully\nthose times. compromising their targets\n\n#### [...], as well as in their ability\n\nThe Dukes rapidly react to research being published\nabout their toolsets and operations. However, the to operate with impunity.\ngroup (or their sponsors) value their operations so\nhighly that though they will attempt to modify their\ntools to evade detection and regain stealth, they will not cease operations to do so, but will instead\nincrementally modify their tools while continuing apparently as previously planned.\n\n\nIn some of the most extreme cases, the Dukes have been known to engage in campaigns with\nunaltered versions of tools that only days earlier have been brought to the public’s attention by\nsecurity companies and actively mentioned in the media. In doing so, the Dukes show unusual\nconfidence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets even when their\ntools have been publicly exposed, as well as in their ability to operate with impunity.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n## THE STORY OF THE DUKES\n\nThe story of the Dukes, as it is currently known, begins with a malware toolset that we call\nPinchDuke. This toolset consists of multiple loaders and an information-stealer trojan.\nImportantly, PinchDuke trojan samples always contain a notable text string, which we\nbelieve is used as a campaign identifier by the Dukes group to distinguish between multiple\nattack campaigns that are run in parallel. These campaign identifiers, which frequently\nspecify both the date and target of the campaign, provide us with a tantalizing view into the\nearly days of the Dukes.\n\n###### 2008: Chechnya\n\nThe earliest activity we have been able to definitively attribute to the Dukes are two PinchDuke\ncampaigns from November 2008. These campaigns use PinchDuke samples that were, according\nto their compilation timestamps, created on the 5[th] and 12[th] of November 2008. The campaign\nidentifiers found in these two samples are respectively, “alkavkaz.com20081105” and “cihaderi.\nnet20081112”.\n\nThe first campaign identifier, found in the sample compiled on the 5[th], references alkavkaz.com,\na domain associated with a Turkish website proclaiming to be the “Chechan [sic] Informational\nCenter” (image 1, page 5). The second campaign identifier, from the sample compiled on the\n12[th], references cihaderi.net, another Turkish website that claims to provide “news from the jihad\nworld” and which dedicates a section of its site to Chechnya.\n\nDue to a lack of other PinchDuke samples from 2008 or earlier, we are unable to estimate when\nthe Duke operation originally began. Based on our technical analysis of the known PinchDuke\nsamples from 2008 however, we believe PinchDuke to have been under development by the\nsummer of 2008.\n\nIn fact, we believe that by the autumn of 2008, the Dukes were already developing not one but at\nleast two distinct malware toolsets. This assertion is based on the oldest currently known sample\nof another Duke-related toolset, GeminiDuke, which was compiled on the 26[th] of January 2009.\nThis sample, like the early PinchDuke samples, appears to already be a “fully-grown” sample,\nwhich is why we believe GeminiDuke was under development by the autumn of 2008.\n\nThat the Dukes were already developing and operating at least two distinct malware toolsets by\nthe second half of 2008 suggests to us that either the size of their cyberespionage operation was\nalready large enough to warrant such an arsenal of tools, or that they expected their operation\nto grow significantly enough in the foreseeable future to warrant the development of such an\narsenal. We examine each of the Duke toolsets in greater detail later in the Tools and Techniques\nsection (page 22).\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Etymology: a note on names\n\nThe origins of the Duke toolset names can be traced back to when researchers at Kaspersky Labs\ncoined the term “MiniDuke” to identify the first Duke-related malware they found. As explained\nin their whitepaper[[7]], the researchers observed the surprisingly small MiniDuke backdoor being\nspread via the same exploit that was being used by a malware that they had already named\nItaDuke; the “Duke” part of this malware’s name had in turn come about because it reminded the\nresearchers of the notable Duqu threat. Despite the shared history of the name itself however, it is\nimportant to note that there is no reason to believe that the Duke toolsets themselves are in any\nway related to the ItaDuke malware, or to Duqu for that matter.\n\nAs researchers continued discovering new toolsets that were created and used by the same\ngroup that had been operating MiniDuke, the new toolsets were also given “Duke”-derived\nnames, and thus the threat actor operating the toolsets started to be commonly referred to\nas “the Dukes”. The only other publicly used name for the threat actor that we are aware of is\n“APT29”[[22]].\n\nSome exceptions to this naming convention do exist, and in the case of specific Duke toolsets,\nother commonly used names are listed in the Tools and Techniques section (page 22).\n\n###### The Dukes\n\n CloudDuke HammerDuke SeaDuke OnionDuke CozyDuke\n CosmicDuke\n\n GeminiDuke PinchDuke\n\n MiniDuke\n\n “duke”\n\n “duke”\n\n\n###### Duqu\n\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2009: First known campaigns against the West\n\nBased on the campaign identifiers found in PinchDuke samples discovered from 2009, the targets\nof the Dukes group during that year included organizations such as the Ministry of Defense of\nGeorgia and the ministries of foreign affairs of Turkey and Uganda. Campaign identifiers from\n2009 also reveal that by that time, the Dukes were already actively interested in political matters\nrelated to the United States (US) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as they ran\ncampaigns targeting (among other organizations) a US-based foreign policy think tank, another\nset of campaigns related to a NATO exercise held in Europe, and a third set apparently targeting\nwhat was then known as the Georgian “Information Centre on NATO”.\n\nOf these campaigns, two clusters in particular stand out. The first is a set of campaigns from\nthe 16[th] and 17[th] of April, 2009, that targeted a US-based foreign policy think tank, as well as\ngovernment institutions in Poland and the Czech Republic (image 1, below). These campaigns\nutilized specially-crafted malicious Microsoft Word documents and PDF files, which were sent as\ne-mail attachments to various personnel in an attempt to infiltrate the targeted organizations.\n\nWe believe this cluster of campaigns had a joint goal of gathering intelligence on the sentiments\nof the targeted 5 countries with respect to the plans being discussed at the time for the US to\nlocate their “European Interceptor Site” missile defense base in Poland, with a related radar station\nthat was intended to be located in the Czech Republic. Regarding the timing of these campaigns,\nit is curious to note that they began only 11 days after President Barack Obama gave a speech on\nthe 5[th] of April declaring his intention to proceed with the deployment of these missile defenses [[1]].\n\nThe second notable cluster comprises of two campaigns that were possibly aimed at gathering\ninformation on Georgia-NATO relations. The first of these runs used the campaign identifier\n“natoinfo_ge”, an apparent reference to the www.natoinfo.ge website belonging to a Georgian\npolitical body that has since been renamed “Information Centre on NATO and EU”. Although\nthe campaign identifier itself doesn’t contain a date, we believe the campaign to have originated\naround the 7[th] of June 2009, which was when the PinchDuke sample in question was compiled.\nThis belief is based on the observation that in all of the other PinchDuke samples we have\nanalyzed, the date of the campaign identifier has been within a day of the compilation date. The\nsecond campaign identifier, which we suspect may be related, is “mod_ge_2009_07_03” from\na month later and apparently targeting the Ministry of Defense of Georgia.\n\nIMAGE 1: EARLY ACTIVITY FROM 2008 & 2009.

The contents appear to have been copied from a BBC news article [[3]].\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2010: The emergence of CosmicDuke in the Caucasus\n\nThe spring of 2010 saw continued PinchDuke campaigns against Turkey and Georgia, but also\nnumerous campaigns against other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States\nsuch as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. Of these, the campaign with the\nidentifier “kaz_2010_07_30”, which possibly targeted Kazakhstan, is of note because it is the last\nPinchDuke campaign we have observed. We believe that during the first half of 2010, the Dukes\nslowly migrated from PinchDuke and started using a new infostealer malware toolset that we call\nCosmicDuke.\n\nThe first known sample of the CosmicDuke toolset was compiled on the 16[th] of January 2010. Back\nthen, CosmicDuke still lacked most of the credential-stealing functionality found in later samples.\nWe believe that during the spring of 2010, the credential and file stealing capabilities of PinchDuke\nwere slowly ported to CosmicDuke, effectively making PinchDuke obsolete.\n\nDuring this period of transition, CosmicDuke would often embed PinchDuke so that, upon\nexecution, CosmicDuke would write to disk and execute PinchDuke. Both PinchDuke and\nCosmicDuke would then operate independently on the same compromised host, including\nperforming separate information gathering, data exfiltration and communication with a\ncommand and control (C&C) server - although both malware would often use the same C&C\nserver. We believe the purpose of this parallel use was to ‘fieldtest’ the new CosmicDuke tool,\nwhile at the same time ensuring operational success with the tried-and-tested PinchDuke.\n\nDuring this period of CosmicDuke testing and development, the Duke authors also started\nexperimenting with the use of privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Specifically, on the 19[th] of\nJanuary 2010 security researcher Tavis Ormandy disclosed a local privilege escalation vulnerability\n(CVE-2010-0232) affecting Microsoft Windows. As part of the disclosure, Ormandy also included\nthe source code for a proof-of- concept exploit for the vulnerability[ [4]]. Just 7 days later, on the\n26[th] of January, a component for CosmicDuke was compiled that exploited the vulnerability and\nallowed the tool to operate with higher privileges.\n\n\n**ONE LOADER TO LOAD THEM ALL (ALMOST)**\n\nIn addition to all the other components being\nproduced by the Dukes group, in 2010 they were\nalso actively developing and testing a new loader - a\ncomponent that wraps the core malware code and\nprovides an additional layer of obfuscation.\n\nThe first sample of this loader was compiled on the\n26[th] of July 2010, making it a direct predecessor of\nwhat has since become known as the “MiniDuke\nloader”, as later versions were extensively used by\nboth MiniDuke and CosmicDuke.\n\nSome hints about the history of the “MiniDuke\nloader” were noted in the CosmicDuke whitepaper\n\n\nwe published [[5]] in 2014, where we observed that\nthe loader appeared to have been in use with\nCosmicDuke before it was used with MiniDuke. In\nfact, we now know that before being used with either,\nthe “MiniDuke loader” was used to load PinchDuke.\nThe first known sample of the loader was used during\nthe summer of 2010, while the most recent samples\nwere seen during the spring of 2015.\n\nThis neatly ties together many of the tools used by\nthe Dukes group, as versions of this one loader have\nbeen used to load malware from three different\nDukes-related toolsets – CosmicDuke, PinchDuke,\nand MiniDuke – over the course of five years.\n\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2011: John Kasai of Klagenfurt, Austria\n\nDuring 2011, the Dukes appear to have significantly expanded both their arsenal of malware\ntoolsets and their C&C infrastructure. While the Dukes employed both hacked websites and\npurposely rented servers for their C&C infrastructure, the group rarely registered their own\ndomain names, preferring instead to connect to their self- operated servers via IP addresses.\n\nThe beginning of 2011 however saw a significant break from that routine, when a large grouping\nof domain names was registered by the Dukes in two batches; the first batch was registered on\nthe 29[th] of January and the second on the 13th of February. All the domains in both batches were\ninitially registered with the same alias: “John Kasai of Klagenfurt, Austria” (image 2, above). These\ndomains were used by the Dukes in campaigns involving many of their different malware toolsets\nall the way until 2014. Like the “MiniDuke loader”, these “John Kasai” domains also provide a\ncommon thread tying together much of the tools and infrastructure of the Dukes.\n\nIMAGE 2: COMPARING WHOIS REGISTRATION DETAILS. Left - Original whois registration details for natureinhome.com, one of the Duke\nC&C server domains registered on the 29th of January, 2011 to “John Kasai”. Right - Details for the domain were later changed, providing\na small glimpse of the Dukes’ sense of humor.\n\n###### 2011: Continuing expansion of the Dukes arsenal\n\nBy 2011, the Dukes had already developed at least 3 distinct malware toolsets, including a plethora\nof supporting components such as loaders and persistence modules. In fact, as a sign of their\narsenal’s breadth, they had already decided to retire one of these malware toolsets as obsolete\nafter developing a replacement for it, seemingly from scratch.\n\nThe Dukes continued the expansion of their arsenal in 2011 with the addition of two more\ntoolsets: MiniDuke and CozyDuke. While all of the earlier toolsets – GeminiDuke, PinchDuke, and\nCosmicDuke – were designed around a core infostealer component, MiniDuke is centered on a\nsimplistic backdoor component whose purpose is to enable the remote execution of commands\non the compromised system. The first observed samples of the MiniDuke backdoor component\nare from May 2011. This backdoor component however is technically very closely related to\nGeminiDuke, to the extent that we believe them to share parts of their source code. The origins\nof MiniDuke can thus be traced back to the origins of GeminiDuke, of which the earliest observed\nsample was compiled in January of 2009.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\nUnlike the simplistic MiniDuke toolset, CozyDuke is a highly versatile, modular, malware\n“platform” whose functionality lies not in a single core component but in an array of modules\nthat it may be instructed to download from its C&C server. These modules are used to selectively\nprovide CozyDuke with just the functionality deemed necessary for the mission at hand.\nCozyDuke’s modular platform approach is a clear break from the designs of the previous Duke\ntoolsets.\n\nThe stylistic differences between CozyDuke and its older siblings are further exemplified by the\nway it was coded. All of the 4 previously mentioned toolsets were written in a minimalistic style\ncommonly seen with malware; MiniDuke even goes as far as having many components written\nin Assembly language. CozyDuke however represents the complete opposite. Instead of being\nwritten in Assembly or C, it was written in C++, which provides added layers of abstraction for the\ndeveloper’s perusal, at the cost of added complexity.\n\nContrary to what might be expected from malware, early CozyDuke versions also lacked any\nattempt at obfuscating or hiding their true nature. In fact, they were extremely open and verbose\nabout their functionality - for example, early samples contained a plethora of logging messages in\nunencrypted form. In comparison, even the earliest known GeminiDuke samples encrypted any\nstrings that might have given away the malware’s true nature.\n\nFinally, early CozyDuke versions also featured other elements that one would associate more with\na traditional software development project than with malware. For instance, the earliest known\nCozyDuke version utilized a feature of the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler known as run-time\nerror checking. This feature added automatic error checking to critical parts of the program’s\nexecution at the cost, from a malware perspective, of providing additional hints that make the\nmalware’s functionality easier for reverse engineers to understand.\n\nBased on these and other similar stylistic differences observed between CozyDuke and its older\nsiblings, we speculate that while the older Duke families appear to be the work of someone with\na background in malware writing (or at the least in hacking), CozyDuke’s author or authors more\nlikely came from a software development background.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2012: Hiding in the shadows\n\nWe still know surprisingly few specifics about the Dukes group’s activities during 2012. Based\non samples of Duke malware from 2012, the Dukes do appear to have continued actively using\nand developing all of their tools. Of these, CosmicDuke and MiniDuke appear to have been in\nmore active use, while receiving only minor updates. GeminiDuke and CozyDuke on the other\nhand appear to have been less used in actual operations, but did undergo much more significant\ndevelopment.\n\nIMAGE 3: MINIDUKE DECOY. One of the Ukraine-themed decoy documents used during a MiniDuke campaign in February 2013.\n\n###### 2013: MiniDuke flies too close to the sun\n\nOn the 12th of February 2013, FireEye published a blogpost[[6]] alerting readers to a combination\nof new Adobe Reader 0-day vulnerabilities, CVE-2013-0640 and CVE-2013-0641, that were being\nactively exploited in the wild. 8 days after FireEye’s initial alert, Kaspersky spotted the same exploit\nbeing used to spread an entirely different malware family from the one mentioned in the original\nreport. On 27[th] February, Kaspersky [[7]] and CrySyS[[8]] Lab published research on this previously\nunidentified malware family, dubbing it MiniDuke.\n\nAs we now know, by February 2013 the Dukes group had been operating MiniDuke and other\ntoolsets for at least 4 and a half years. Their malware had not stayed undetected for those 4 and a\nhalf years. In fact, in 2009 a PinchDuke sample had been included in the malware set used by the\nAV-Test security product testing organization to perform anti-virus product comparison reviews.\nUntil 2013 however, earlier Duke toolsets had not been put in a proper context. That finally started\nto change in 2013.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\nThe MiniDuke samples that were spread using these exploits were compiled on the 20th of\nFebruary, after the exploit was already publicly known. One might argue that since this took\nplace after the exploits were publicly mentioned, the Dukes simply copied them. We however do\nnot believe so. As mentioned by Kaspersky, even though the exploits used for these MiniDuke\ncampaigns were near-identical to those described by FireEye, there were nevertheless small\ndifferences. Of these, the crucial one is the presence of PDB strings in the MiniDuke exploits.\nThese strings, which are generated by the compiler when using specific compilation settings,\nmeans that the components of the exploits used with MiniDuke had to have been compiled\nindependently from those described by FireEye.\n\nWe do not know whether the Dukes compiled the components themselves or whether someone\nelse compiled the components before handing them to the group. This does however still rule\nout the possibility that the Dukes simply obtained copies of the exploit binaries described by\nFireEye and repurposed them.\n\nIn our opinion, this insistence on using exploits that are already under heightened scrutiny\nsuggests the existence of at least one of three circumstances. Firstly, the Dukes may have been\nconfident enough in their own abilities (and in the slowness of their opponents to react to new\nthreats) that they did not care if their targets may already be on the lookout for anyone exploiting\nthese vulnerabilities. Secondly, the value the Dukes intended to gain from these MiniDuke\ncampaigns may have been so great that they deemed it worth the risk of getting noticed. Or\nthirdly, the Dukes may have invested so much into these campaigns that by the time FireEye\npublished their alert, the Dukes felt they could not afford to halt the campaigns.\n\nWe believe all three circumstances to have coexisted at least to some extent. As will become\nevident in this report, this was not a one-off case but a recurring theme with the Dukes, in that\nthey would rather continue with their operations as planned than retreat from operating under\nthe spotlight.\n\nAs originally detailed in Kaspersky’s whitepaper, the MiniDuke campaigns from February 2013\nemployed spear-phishing emails with malicious PDF file attachments. These PDFs would attempt\nto silently infect the recipient with MiniDuke, while distracting them by displaying a decoy\ndocument. The headings of these documents included “Ukraine’s NATO Membership Action Plan\n(MAP) Debates”, “The Informal Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Seminar on Human Rights”, and\n“Ukraine’s Search for a Regional Foreign Policy” (image 3, page 8). The targets of these campaigns,\naccording to Kaspersky, were located variously in Belgium, Hungary, Luxembourg and Spain [[7]].\n\nKaspersky goes on to state that by obtaining log files from the MiniDuke command and control\nservers, they were able to identify high-profile victims from Ukraine, Belgium, Portugal, Romania,\nthe Czech Republic, Ireland, the United States and Hungary [[7]].\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\nIMAGE 4: ONIONDUKE-TROJANIZED TORRENT FILE. Example of a torrent file containing an executable trojanized with the OnionDuke\ntoolset.\n\n###### 2013: The curious case of OnionDuke\n\nAfter the February campaigns, MiniDuke activity appeared to quiet down, although it did not\nfully stop, for the rest of 2013. The Dukes group as a whole however showed no sign of slowing\ndown. In fact, we saw yet another Duke malware toolset, OnionDuke, appear first in 2013. Like\nCozyDuke, OnionDuke appears to have been designed with versatility in mind, and takes a\nsimilarly modular platform approach. The OnionDuke toolset includes various modules for\npurposes such as password stealing, information gathering, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and\neven posting spam to the Russian social media network, VKontakte. The OnionDuke toolset\nalso includes a dropper, an information stealer variant and multiple distinct versions of the core\ncomponent that is responsible for interacting with the various modules.\n\nWhat makes OnionDuke especially curious is an infection vector it began using during the\nsummer of 2013. To spread the toolset, the Dukes used a wrapper to combine OnionDuke with\nlegitimate applications, created torrent files containing these trojanized applications, then\nuploaded them to websites hosting torrent files (image 4, above). Victims who used the torrent\nfiles to download the applications would end up getting infected with OnionDuke.\n\nFor most of the OnionDuke components we observed, the first versions that we are aware of were\ncompiled during the summer of 2013, suggesting that this was a period of active development\naround this toolset. Critically however, the first sample of the OnionDuke dropper, which we have\nobserved being used only with components of this toolset, was compiled on the 17[th] of February\n2013. This is significant because it suggests that OnionDuke was under development before any\npart of the Duke operation became public. OnionDuke’s development therefore could not have\nbeen simply a response to the outing of one of the other Duke malware, but was instead intended\nfor use alongside the other toolsets. This indication that the Dukes planned to use an arsenal of 5\nmalware toolsets in parallel suggests that they were operating with both significant resources and\ncapacity.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2013: The Dukes and Ukraine\n\nIn 2013, many of the decoy documents employed by the Dukes in their campaigns were related\nto Ukraine; examples include a letter undersigned by the First Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs\nof Ukraine, a letter from the embassy of the Netherlands in Ukraine to the Ukrainian Ministry of\nForeign affairs and a document titled “Ukraine’s Search for a Regional Foreign Policy”. [[9]]\n\nThese decoy documents however were written before the start of the November 2013\nEuromaidan protests in Ukraine and the subsequent upheaval. It is therefore important to note\nthat, contrary to what might be assumed, we have actually observed a drop instead of an increase\nin Ukraine-related campaigns from the Dukes following the country’s political crisis.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to some other suspected Russian threat actors (such as Operation Pawn\nStorm [[10]]) who appear to have increased their targeting of Ukraine following the crisis. This\nsupports our analysis that the overarching theme in the Dukes’ targeting is the collection of\nintelligence to support diplomatic efforts. The Dukes actively targeted Ukraine before the crisis,\nat a time when Russia was still weighing her options, but once Russia moved from diplomacy to\ndirect action, Ukraine was no longer relevant to the Dukes in the same way.\n\nIMAGE 5: COSMICDUKE DECOY. Screenshot of a decoy document appearing to be an order for growth hormones, which was used in a\nCosmicDuke campaign in September 2013.\n\n###### 2013: CosmicDuke’s war on drugs\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, in September 2013 a CosmicDuke campaign was observed targeting\nRussian speakers involved in the trade of illegal and controlled substances (image 5, above).\n\nKaspersky Labs, who sometimes refer to CosmicDuke as ‘Bot Gen Studio’, speculated that\n“one possibility is that ‘Bot Gen Studio’ is a malware platform also available as a so-called ‘legal\nspyware’ tool”; therefore, those using CosmicDuke to target drug dealers and those targeting\ngovernments are two separate entities [[11]]. We however feel it is unlikely that the CosmicDuke\noperators targeting drug dealers and those targeting governments could be two entirely\nindependent entities. A shared supplier of malware would explain the overlap in tools, but it\nwould not explain the significant overlap we have also observed in operational techniques related\nto command and control infrastructure. Instead, we feel the targeting of drug dealers was a new\ntask for a subset of the Dukes group, possibly due to the drug trade’s relevance to security policy\nissues. We also believe the tasking to have been temporary, because we have not observed any\nfurther similar targeting from the Dukes after the spring of 2014.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2014: MiniDuke’s rise from the ashes\n\nWhile MiniDuke activity decreased significantly during the rest of 2013 following the attention it\ngarnered from researchers, the beginning of 2014 saw the toolset back in full force. All MiniDuke\ncomponents, from the loader and downloader to the backdoor, had been slightly updated and\nmodified during the downtime. Interestingly, the nature of these modifications suggests that\ntheir primary purpose was to regain the element of stealth and undetectability that had been lost\nalmost a year earlier.\n\nOf these modifications, arguably the most important were the ones done to the loader. These\nresulted in a loader version that would later become known as the “Nemesis Gemina loader” due\nto PDB strings found in many of the samples. It is however still only an iteration on earlier versions\nof the MiniDuke loader.\n\nThe first observed samples of the Nemesis Gemina loader (compiled on 14[th] December 2013) were\nused to load the updated MiniDuke backdoor, but by the spring of 2014 the Nemesis Gemina\nloader was also observed in use with CosmicDuke.\n\n###### 2014: CosmicDuke’s moment of fame and the scramble that ensued\n\nFollowing the MiniDuke expose, CosmicDuke in turn got its moment of fame when F-Secure\npublished a whitepaper about it on 2[nd] July 2014 [[5]]. The next day, Kaspersky also published\ntheir own research on the malware [[11]]. It should be noted that until this point, even though\nCosmicDuke had been in active use for over 4 years, and had undergone minor modifications\nand updates during that time, even the most recent CosmicDuke samples would often embed\npersistence components that date back to 2012. These samples would also contain artefacts of\nfunctionality from the earliest CosmicDuke samples from 2010.\n\nIt is therefore valuable to observe how the Dukes reacted to CosmicDuke’s outing at the\nbeginning of July. By the end of that month, CosmicDuke samples we found that had been\ncompiled on the 30th of July had shed unused parts of their code that had essentially just\nbeen relics of the past. Similarly, some of the hardcoded values that had remained unaltered in\nCosmicDuke samples for many years had been changed. We believe these edits were an attempt\nat evading detection by modifying or removing parts of the toolset that the authors believed\nmight be helpful in identifying and detecting it.\n\nConcurrently with the alterations to CosmicDuke, the Dukes were also hard at work modifying\ntheir trusted loader. Much like the CosmicDuke toolset, the loader used by both MiniDuke and\nCosmicDuke had previously only undergone one major update (the Nemesis Gemina upgrade)\nsince the first known samples from 2010. Again, much of the modification work focused on\nremoving redundant code in an attempt to appear different from earlier versions of the loader.\nInterestingly however, another apparent evasion trick was also attempted - forging of the loaders’\ncompilation timestamps.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first CosmicDuke sample we observed after the initial research on CosmicDuke was a\nsample compiled on the 30th of July 2014. The loader used by the sample purported to have\nbeen compiled on the 25[th] of March 2010. Due to artefacts left in the loader during compilation\ntime however, we know that it used a specific version of the Boost library, 1.54.0, that was only\npublished on the 1[st] of July 2013 [[12]]. The compilation timestamp therefore had to have been\nfaked. F-Secure’s whitepaper[[5]] on CosmicDuke includes a timeline of the loader’s usage, based\non compilation timestamps. Perhaps the Dukes group thought that by faking a timestamp from\nbefore the earliest one cited in the whitepaper, they might be able to confuse researchers.\n\nDuring the rest of 2014 and the spring of 2015, the Dukes continued making similar evasionfocused modifications to CosmicDuke, as well as experimenting with ways to obfuscate the\nloader. In the latter case however, the group appear to have also simultaneously developed an\nentirely new loader, which we first observed being used in conjunction with CosmicDuke during\nthe spring of 2015.\n\nWhile it is not surprising that the Dukes reacted to multiple companies publishing extensive\nreports on one of their key toolsets, it is valuable to note the manner in which they responded.\nMuch like the MiniDuke expose in February 2013, the Dukes again appeared to prioritize\ncontinuing operations over staying hidden. They could have ceased all use of CosmicDuke\n(at least until they had developed a new loader) or retired it entirely, since they still had other\ntoolsets available. Instead, they opted for minimal downtime and attempted to continue\noperations, with only minor modifications to the toolset.\n\n###### 2014: CozyDuke and monkey videos\n\nWhile we now know that CozyDuke had been under development since at least the end of 2011, it\nwas not until the early days of July 2014 that the first large-scale CozyDuke campaign that we are\naware of took place. This campaign, like later CozyDuke campaigns, began with spear-phishing\nemails that tried to impersonate commonly seen spam emails. These spear-phishing emails would\ncontain links that eventually lead the victim to becoming infected with CozyDuke.\n\nSome of the CozyDuke spear-phishing emails from early July posed as e-fax arrival notifications,\na popular theme for spam emails, and used the same “US letter fax test page” decoy document\nthat was used a year later by CloudDuke. In at least one case however, the email instead contained\na link to a zip-archive file named “Office Monkeys LOL Video.zip”, which was hosted on the\nDropBox cloud storage service. What made this particular case interesting was that instead of the\nusual dull PDF file, the decoy was a Flash video file, more specifically a Super Bowl advertisement\nfrom 2007 purporting to show monkeys at an office (image 6, page 16).\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\nIMAGE 6: COZYDUKE DECOYS. Left - US letter fax test decoy used in CozyDuke campaigns Right - Screenshot of the monkey video\ndecoy also used by CozyDuke\n\n###### 2014: OnionDuke gets caught using a malicious Tor node\n\nOn the 23[rd] of October 2014, Leviathan Security Group published a blog post describing a\nmalicious Tor exit node they had found. They noted that this node appeared to be maliciously\nmodifying any executables that were downloaded through it over a HTTP connection. Executing\nthe modified applications obtained this way would result in the victim being infected with\nunidentified malware. On the 14[th] of November, F-Secure published a blog post naming the\nmalware OnionDuke and associating it with MiniDuke and CosmicDuke, the other Duke toolsets\nknown at the time [[13]].\n\nBased on our investigations into OnionDuke, we believe that for about 7 months, from April 2014\nto when Leviathan published their blog post in October 2014, the Tor exit node identified by\nthe researchers was being used to wrap executables on-the-fly with OnionDuke (image 7, page\n13). This is similar to the way in which the toolset was being spread via trojanized applications in\ntorrent files during the summer of 2013.\n\nWhile investigating the OnionDuke variant being spread by the malicious Tor node, we also\nidentified another OnionDuke variant that appeared to have successfully compromised multiple\nvictims in the ministry of foreign affairs of an Eastern European country during the spring of 2014.\nThis variant differed significantly in functionality from the one being spread via the Tor node,\nfurther suggesting that different OnionDuke variants are intended for different kinds of victims.\n\nWe believe that, unusually, the purpose of the OnionDuke variant spread via the Tor node was\nnot to pursue targeted attacks but instead to form a small botnet for later use. This OnionDuke\nvariant is related to the one seen during the summer of 2013 being spread via torrent files. Both\nof these infection vectors are highly indiscriminate and untargeted when compared to spearphishing, the usual infection vector of choice for the Dukes.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\nIMAGE 7: FLOWCHART OF HOW ONIONDUKE USES MALICIOUS TOR NODE TO INFECT VICTIMS.\n\n\n##### TOTAL: 1389\n\nMONGOLIA\nINDIA 326\n260 **23%**\n##### 19%\n\n284\n\nOTHER **21%**\n235\n##### 17%\n\nALGERIA\n\nUNKNOWN\n\n58\n\n100 **4%**\n##### 7% PAKISTAN\n64 MOROCCO\n##### 5% 62\n 4%\n\nIMAGE 8: GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF ONIONDUKE BOTNET.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n##### 3% EACH\n\n**2% EACH**\n\n**1% EACH**\n\n\nEGYPT, 43\n\nUSA, 39\n\nTURKEY, 38\n\nINDONESIA, 34\n\nSAUDI ARABIA, 25\n\nBRAZIL, 22\n\nPHILIPPINESS, 16\nSRI LANKA, 15\n\nBANGLADESH, 14\n\nNEPAL, 13\nCAMBODIA, 13\n\nCHINA, 12\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther, the functionality of the OnionDuke variant is derived from a number of modules. While\none of these modules gathers system information and another attempts to steal the victim’s\nusernames and passwords, as one would expect from a malware used for a targeted attack, the\nother two known OnionDuke modules are quite the opposite; one is designed for use in DoS\nattacks and the other for posting predetermined messages to the Russian VKontakte social\nmedia site. This sort of functionality is more common in criminality-oriented botnets, not statesponsored targeted attacks.\n\nWe have since been able to identify at least two separate OnionDuke botnets. We believe the\nformation of the first of these botnets began in January 2014, using both unidentified infection\nvectors and the known malicious Tor node, and continued until our blogpost was published in\nNovember. We believe the formation of the second botnet began in August 2014 and continued\nuntil January 2015. We have been unable to identify the infection vectors used for this second\nbotnet, but the C&C servers it used had open directory listings, allowing us to retrieve files\ncontaining listings of victim IP addresses. The geographic distribution of these IP addresses\n(image 8, page 13) further supports our theory that the purpose of this OnionDuke variant was not\ntargeted attacks against high-profile targets.\n\nOne theory is that the botnets were a criminal side business for the Dukes group. The size of the\nbotnet however (about 1400 bots) is very small if its intended use is for commercial DoS attacks\nor spam-sending. Alternatively, OnionDuke also steals user credentials from its victims, providing\nanother potential revenue source. The counter to that argument however is that the value of\nstolen credentials from users in the countries with the highest percentage of OnionDuke bots\n(Mongolia and India) are among the lowest on underground markets.\n\nIMAGE 9: ONIONDUKE C&C TWEET. Screenshot of a tweet intended for OnionDuke, with a link pointing to an image file that embeds an\nupdated version of OnionDuke.\n\n###### 2015: The Dukes up the ante\n\nThe end of January 2015 saw the start of the most high- volume Duke campaign seen thus far, with\nthousands of recipients being sent spear-phishing emails that contained links to compromised\nwebsites hosting CozyDuke. Curiously, the spear-phishing emails were strikingly similar to the\ne-fax themed spam usually seen spreading ransomware and other common crimeware. Due to\nthe sheer number of recipients, it may not have been possible to customize the emails in the\nsame way as was possible with lower-volume campaigns.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\nThe similarity to common spam may however also serve a more devious purpose. It is easy to\nimagine a security analyst, burdened by the amount of attacks against their network, dismissing\nsuch common-looking spam as “just another crimeware spam run”, allowing the campaign to, in\nessence, hide in the masses [[14]].\n\nThe CozyDuke activity continues one of the long-running trends of the Dukes operations, the\nuse of multiple malware toolsets against a single target. In this case, the Dukes first attempted\nto infect large numbers of potential targets with CozyDuke (and in a more obvious manner than\npreviously seen). They would then use the toolset to gather initial information on the victims,\nbefore deciding which ones to pursue further. For the victims deemed interesting enough, the\nDukes would then deploy a different toolset.\n\nWe believe the primary purpose of this tactic is an attempt at evading detection in the targeted\nnetwork. Even if the noisy initial CozyDuke campaign is noticed by the victim organization, or\nby someone else who then makes it publicly known, defenders will begin by first looking for\nindicators of compromise (IOCs) related to the CozyDuke toolset. If however by that time the\nDukes are already operating within the victim’s network, using an another toolset with different\nIOCs, then it is reasonable to assume that it will take much longer for the victim organization to\nnotice the infiltration.\n\nIn previous cases, the group used their malware toolsets interchangeably, as either the initial or\na later-stage toolset in a campaign. For these CozyDuke campaigns however, the Dukes appear\nto have employed two particular later-stage toolsets, SeaDuke and HammerDuke, that were\npurposely designed to leave a persistent backdoor on the compromised network. HammerDuke\nis a set of backdoors that was first seen in the wild in February 2015, while SeaDuke is a crossplatform backdoor that was, according to Symantec, first spotted in the wild in October 2014 [[15]].\nBoth toolsets were originally spotted being deployed by CozyDuke to its victims.\n\nWhat makes SeaDuke special is that it was written in Python and designed to work on both\nWindows and Linux systems; it is the first cross-platform tool we have seen from the Dukes. One\nplausible reason for developing such a flexible malware might be that the group were increasingly\nencountering victim environments where users were using Linux as their desktop operating\nsystem.\n\nMeanwhile, HammerDuke is a Windows-only malware (written in .NET) and comes in two variants.\nThe simpler one will connect to a hardcoded C&C server over HTTP or HTTPS to download\ncommands to execute. The more advanced variant, on the other hand, will use an algorithm to\ngenerate a periodically-changing Twitter account name and will then attempt to find tweets\nfrom that account containing links to the actual download location of the commands to execute.\nIn this way, the advanced HammerDuke variant attempts to hide its network traffic in more\nlegitimate use of Twitter. This method is not unique to HammerDuke, as MiniDuke, OnionDuke,\nand CozyDuke all support similar use of Twitter (image 9, page 18) to retrieve links to additional\npayloads or commands.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2015: CloudDuke\n\nIn the beginning of July 2015, the Dukes embarked on yet another large-scale phishing campaign.\nThe malware toolset used for this campaign was the previously unseen CloudDuke and we believe\nthat the July campaign marks the first time that this toolset was deployed by the Dukes, other\nthan possible small-scale testing.\n\nThe CloudDuke toolset consists of at least a loader, a downloader, and two backdoor\nvariants. Both backdoors (internally referred to by their authors as “BastionSolution” and\n“OneDriveSolution”) essentially allow the operator to remotely execute commands on the\ncompromised machine. The way in which each backdoor does so however is significantly\ndifferent. While the BastionSolution variant simply retrieves commands from a hard-coded\nC&C server controlled by the Dukes, the OneDriveSolution utilizes Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud\nstorage service for communicating with its masters, making it significantly harder for defenders\nto notice the traffic and block the communication channel. What is most significant about the\nJuly 2015 CloudDuke campaign is the timeline. The campaign appeared to consist of two distinct\nwaves of spear-phishing, one during the first days of July and the other starting from the 20th\nof the month. Details of the first wave, including a thorough technical analysis of CloudDuke,\nwas published by Palo Alto Networks on 14[th] July [[16]]. This was followed by additional details from\nKaspersky in a blog post published on 16[th] July [[17]].\n\nBoth publications happened before the second wave took place and received notable publicity.\nDespite the attention and public exposure of the toolset’s technical details (including IOCs) to\ndefenders, the Dukes still continued with their second wave of spear-phishing, including the\ncontinued use of CloudDuke. The group did change the contents of the spear-phishing emails\nthey sent, but they didn’t switch to a new email format; instead, they reverted to the same efaxthemed format that they had previously employed, even to the point of reusing the exact same\ndecoy document that they had used in the CozyDuke campaign a year earlier (July 2014).\n\nThis once more highlights two crucial behavioral elements of the Dukes group. Firstly, as with\nthe MiniDuke campaigns of February 2013 and CosmicDuke campaigns in the summer of 2014,\nagain the group clearly prioritized the continuation of their operations over maintaining stealth.\nSecondly, it underlines their boldness, arrogance and self-confidence; they are clearly confident\nin both their ability to compromise their targets even when their tools and techniques are already\npublicly known, and critically, they appear to be extremely confident in their ability to act with\nimpunity.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2015: Continuing surgical strikes with CosmicDuke\n\nIn addition to the notably overt and large-scale campaigns with CozyDuke and CloudDuke, the\nDukes also continued to engage in more covert, surgical campaigns using CosmicDuke. The latest\nof these campaigns that we are aware of occurred during the spring and early summer of 2015.\nAs their infection vectors, these campaigns used malicious documents exploiting recently fixed\nvulnerabilities.\n\nTwo of these campaigns were detailed in separate blog posts by the Polish security company\nPrevenity, who said that both campaigns targeted Polish entities with spear- phishing emails\ncontaining malicious attachments with relevant Polish language names [[18] [19]]. A third, similar,\nCosmicDuke campaign was observed presumably targeting Georgian entities since it used an\nattachment with a Georgian-language name that translates to “NATO consolidates control of the\nBlack Sea.docx”.\n\nBased on this, we do not believe that the Dukes are replacing their covert and targeted campaigns\nwith the overt and opportunistic CozyDuke and CloudDuke style of campaigns. Instead, we believe\nthat they are simply expanding their activities by adding new tools and techniques.\n\nLoader\n\nCloudDuke\n\nHammerDuke\n\nBackdoor\n\nSeaDuke\n\nOnionDuke\n\nCozyDuke\n\nCosmicDuke [MiniDuke]\n\n**LEGEND**\n\nGeminiDuke\n\nMost recent\n\nPinchDuke known activity\n\nFirst known\n\n**TOOLKITS**\n\nactivity\n\nIMAGE 10: TIMELINE OF KNOWN ACTIVITY FOR THE VARIOUS DUKE TOOLKITS.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n2015\n\n2014\n\n2013\n\n2012\n\n**YEAR**\n\n2011\n\n2010\n\n2009\n\n2008\n\n|Loader CloudDuke|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||Backdoor||||HammerDuke SeaDuke|\n|||||||||\n|||||||OnionDuke||\n||||||CozyDuke|||\n|||MiniDuke CosmicDuke||||||\n||LEGEND|||||||\n|GeminiDuke Most recent PinchDuke known activity||||||||\n|First known TOOLKITS activity||||||||\n\n\n-----\n\n## TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES OF THE DUKES\n\n###### PINCHDUKE\n\nFirst known activity November 2008\n\nMost recent known activity Summer 2010\n\nOther names N/A\n\nC&C communication methods HTTP (S)\n\nKnown toolset components\n\n                                              - Multiple loaders\n\n                                             - Information stealer\n\nThe PinchDuke toolset consists of multiple loaders and a core information stealer trojan.\nThe loaders associated with the PinchDuke toolset have also been observed being used with\nCosmicDuke.\n\nThe PinchDuke information stealer gathers system configuration information, steals user\ncredentials, and collects user files from the compromised host transferring these via HTTP(S) to a\nC&C server.

What is less common is that the name used for the mutex\nis often a timestamp. We believe these timestamps to be generated during the compilation of\nGeminiDuke from the local time of the computer being used.\n\nComparing the GeminiDuke compilation timestamps, which always reference the time in the\nUTC+0 timezone, with the local time timestamps used as mutex names, and adjusting for the\npresumed timezone difference, we note that all of the mutex names reference a time and date\nthat is within seconds of the respective sample’s compilation timestamp. Additionally, the\napparent timezone of the timestamps in all of the GeminiDuke samples compiled during the\nwinter is UTC+3, while for samples compiled during the summer, it is UTC+4.\n\nThe observed timezones correspond to the pre-2011 definition of Moscow Standard Time (MSK)\n\n[20], which was UTC+3 during the winter and UTC+4 during the summer. In 2011 MSK stopped\nfollowing Daylight Saving Time (DST) and was set to UTC+4 year-round, then reset to UTC +3 yearround in 2014. Some of the observed GeminiDuke samples that used timestamps as mutex names\nwere compiled while MSK still respected DST and for these samples, the timestamps perfectly\nalign with MSK as it was defined at the time.\n\nMap of timezones in Russia; © Eric Muller[ [23]] Pink: MSK (UTC +3) ; Orange: UTC +4\n\nHowever, GeminiDuke samples compiled after MSK was altered still vary the timezone between\nUTC+3 in the winter and UTC+4 during the summer. While computers using Microsoft Windows\nautomatically adjust for DST, changes in timezone definitions require that an update to Windows\nbe installed. We therefore believe that the Dukes group simply failed to update the computer\nthey were using to compile GeminiDuke samples, so that the timestamps seen in later samples\nstill appear to follow the old definition of Moscow Standard Time.\n\nThe GeminiDuke infostealer has occasionally been wrapped with a loader that appears to be\nunique to GeminiDuke and has never been observed being used with any of the other Duke\ntoolsets. GeminiDuke also occasionally embeds additional executables that attempt to achieve\npersistence on the victim computer. These persistence components appear to be uniquely\ncustomized for use with GeminiDuke, but they use many of the same techniques as CosmicDuke\npersistence components.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n|COSMICDUKE|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||First known activity|January 2010|\n||Most recent known activity|Summer 2015|\n||Other names|Tinybaron, BotgenStudios, NemesisGemina|\n||C&C communication methods|HTTP (S), FTP, WebDav|\n||Known toolset components|◊ Information stealer ◊ Multiple loaders ◊ Privilege escalation component ◊ Multiple persistence components|\n\n\nThe CosmicDuke toolset is designed around a main information stealer component. This\ninformation stealer is augmented by a variety of components that the toolset operators may\nselectively include with the main component to provide additional functionalities, such as\nmultiple methods of establishing persistence, as well as modules that attempt to exploit privilege\nescalation vulnerabilities in order to execute CosmicDuke with higher privileges. CosmicDuke’s\ninformation stealing functionality includes:\n\n- Keylogging\n\n- Taking screenshots\n\n- Stealing clipboard contents\n\n- Stealing user files with file extensions that match a predefined list\n\n- Exporting the users cryptographic certificates including private keys\n\n- Collecting user credentials, including passwords, for a variety of popular chat and email\n\nprograms as well as from web browsers\n\nCosmicDuke may use HTTP, HTTPS, FTP or WebDav to exfiltrate the collected data to a hardcoded\nC&C server.\n\nWhile we believe CosmicDuke to be an entirely custom- written toolset with no direct sharing\nof code with other Duke toolsets, the high-level ways in which many of its features have been\nimplemented appear to be shared with other members of the Duke arsenal.\n\nSpecifically, the techniques CosmicDuke uses to extract user credentials from targeted software\nand to detect the presence of analysis tools appear to be based on the techniques used by\nPinchDuke. Likewise, many of CosmicDuke’s persistence components use techniques also used\nby components associated with GeminiDuke and CozyDuke. In all of these cases, the techniques\nare the same, but the code itself has been altered to work with the toolset in question, leading to\nsmall differences in the final implementation.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\nA few of the CosmicDuke samples we discovered also included components that attempt to\nexploit either of the publicly known CVE-2010-0232 or CVE-2010- 4398 privilege escalation\nvulnerabilities. In the case of CVE-2010-0232, the exploit appears to be based directly on the\nproof of concept code published by security researcher Tavis Ormandy when he disclosed the\nvulnerability [[4]]. We believe that the exploit for CVE- 2010-4398 was also based on a publicly\navailable proof of concept [[21]].\n\nIn addition to often embedding persistence or privilege escalation components, CosmicDuke has\noccasionally embedded PinchDuke, GeminiDuke, or MiniDuke components. It should be noted\nthat CosmicDuke does not interoperate with the second, embedded malware in any way other\nthan by writing the malware to disk and executing it. After that, CosmicDuke and the second\nmalware operate entirely independently of each other, including separately contacting their C&C\nservers. Sometimes, both malware have used the same C&C server, but in other cases, even the\nservers have been different.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that while most of the compilation timestamps for CosmicDuke samples\nappear to be authentic, we are aware of a few cases of them being forged.

Additionally, a specific loader is often associated with\nthe MiniDuke toolset and is referred to as the “MiniDuke loader”.\n\nWhile the loader has often been used together with other MiniDuke components, it has also\ncommonly been used in conjunction with CosmicDuke and PinchDuke. In fact, the oldest samples\nof the loader that we have found were used with PinchDuke. To avoid confusion however, we have\ndecided to continue referring to the loader as the “MiniDuke loader”.\n\nTwo details about MiniDuke components are worth noting. Firstly, some of the MiniDuke\ncomponents were written in Assembly language. While many malware were written in Assembly\nduring the ‘old days‘ of curiosity-driven virus writing, it has since become a rarity. Secondly, some\nof the MiniDuke components do not contain a hardcoded C&C server address, but instead obtain\nthe address of a current C&C server via Twitter. The use of Twitter either to initially obtain the\naddress of a C&C server (or as a backup if no hardcoded primary C&C server responds) is a feature\nalso found in OnionDuke, CozyDuke, and HammerDuke.\n\nFurther reading\n\n**1.** Costin Raiu, Igor Soumenkov, Kurt Baumgartner, Vitaly Kamluk; Kaspersky Lab; The MiniDuke Mystery: PDF 0-day\n\n[Government Spy Assembler 0x29A Micro Backdoor; published 27 February 2013; http://kasperskycontenthub.com/](http://kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/vlpdfs/themysteryofthepdf0-dayassemblermicrobackdoor.pdf)\n[wp-content/ uploads/sites/43/vlpdfs/themysteryofthepdf0-dayassemblermicrobackdoor.pdf](http://kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/vlpdfs/themysteryofthepdf0-dayassemblermicrobackdoor.pdf)\n**2.** [CrySyS Blog; Miniduke; published 27 February 2013; http://blog.crysys.hu/2013/02/miniduke/](http://blog.crysys.hu/2013/02/miniduke/)\n**3.** [Marius Tivadar, Bíró Balázs, Cristian Istrate; BitDefender; A Closer Look at MiniDuke; published April 2013; http://labs.](http://labs.bitdefender.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/04/MiniDuke_Paper_Final.pdf)\n\n[bitdefender. com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/04/ MiniDuke_Paper_Final.pdf](http://labs.bitdefender.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/04/MiniDuke_Paper_Final.pdf)\n**4.** CIRCL - Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg; Analysis Report (TLP:WHITE) Analysis of a stage 3 Miniduke\n\n[sample; published 30 May 2013; https://www.circl.lu/files/tr-14/ circl-analysisreport-miniduke-stage3-public.pdf](https://www.circl.lu/files/tr-14/circl-analysisreport-miniduke-stage3-public.pdf)\n**5.** [ESET WeLiveSecurity blog; Miniduke still duking it out; published 20 May 2014; http://www. welivesecurity.](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/05/20/miniduke-still-duking/)\n\n[com/2014/05/20/miniduke-still-duking/](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/05/20/miniduke-still-duking/)\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n|COZYDUKE|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||First known activity|January 2010|\n||Most recent known activity:|Spring 2015|\n||Other names|CozyBear, CozyCar, Cozer, EuroAPT|\n||C&C communication methods|HTTP (S), Twitter (backup)|\n||Known toolset components|◊ Dropper ◊ Modular backdoor ◊ Multiple persistence components ◊ Information gathering module ◊ Screenshot module ◊ Password stealing module ◊ Password hash stealing module|\n\n\nCozyDuke is not simply a malware toolset; rather, it is a modular malware platform formed around\na core backdoor component.

Once\nthe victim finished downloading the file and executed it, the wrapper would infect the victim’s\ncomputer with OnionDuke before executing the original legitimate executable.\n\nThe same wrapper has also been used to wrap legitimate executable files, which were then\nmade available for users to download from torrent sites.

This, together\nwith HammerDuke’s simplistic backdoor functionality, suggests that it is primarily used by the\nDukes group as a secondary backdoor left on CozyDuke victims after CozyDuke performed the\ninitial infection and stole any readily available information from them.\n\nHammerDuke is however interesting because it is written in .NET, and even more so because\nof its occasional use of Twitter as a C&C communication channel. Some HammerDuke variants\nonly contain a hardcoded C&C server address from which they will retrieve commands, but other\nHammerDuke variants will first use a custom algorithm to generate a Twitter account name based\non the current date. If the account exists, HammerDuke will then search for tweets from that\naccount with links to image files that contain embedded commands for the toolset to execute.\n\nHammerDuke’s use of Twitter and crafted image files is reminiscent of other Duke toolsets. Both\nOnionDuke and MiniDuke also use date-based algorithms to generate Twitter account names\nand then searched for any tweets from those accounts that linked to image files. In contrast\nhowever, for OnionDuke and MiniDuke the linked image files contain embedded malware to be\ndownloaded and executed, rather than instructions.\n\nSimilarly, GeminiDuke may also download image files, but these would contain embedded\nadditional configuration information for the toolset itself. Unlike HammerDuke however, the\nURLs for the images downloaded by GeminiDuke are hardcoded in its initial configuration, rather\nthan retrieved from Twitter.\n\nFurther reading\n\n**1.** FireEye; HAMMERTOSS: Stealthy Tactics Define a Russian Cyber Threat Group; published July 2015;\n\n[https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/848-DID-242/ images/rpt-apt29-hammertoss.pdf *](https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/848-DID-242/images/rpt-apt29-hammertoss.pdf)\n\n*APT29 is the name used by FireEye to identify the cyberespionagegroup we refer to as the Dukes.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n|CLOUDDUKE|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||First known activity|June 2015|\n||Most recent known activity|Summer 2015|\n||Other names|MiniDionis, CloudLook|\n||C&C communication methods|HTTP (S), Microsoft OneDrive|\n||Known toolset components|◊ Downloader ◊ Loader ◊ Two backdoor variants|\n\n\nCloudDuke is a malware toolset known to consist of, at least, a downloader, a loader and two\nbackdoor variants.

These spear-phishing emails range from ones purposely designed to look like spam\nmessages used to spread common crimeware and addressed to large numbers of people, to\nhighly targeted emails addressed to only a few recipients (or even just one person) and with\ncontent that is highly relevant for the intended recipient(s). In some cases, the Dukes appear to\nhave used previously compromised victims to send new spear-phishing emails to other targets.\n\nThe spear-phishing emails used by the Dukes may contain either specially-crafted malicious\nattachments or links to URLs hosting the malware. When malicious attachments are used, they\nmay either be designed to exploit a vulnerability in a popular software assumed to be installed on\nthe victim’s machine, such as Microsoft Word or Adobe Reader, or the attachment itself may have\nits icon and filename obfuscated in such a way that the file does not appear to be an executable.\n\nThe only instances which we are aware of where the Dukes did not use spear-phishing as the\ninitial infection vector is with certain OnionDuke variants. These were instead spread using either\na malicious Tor node that would trojanize legitimate applications on-the-fly with the OnionDuke\ntoolset, or via torrent files containing previously trojanized versions of legitimate applications.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that the Dukes are known to sometimes re-infect a victim of one of\ntheir malware tools with another one of their tools. Examples include CozyDuke infecting its\nvictims with SeaDuke, HammerDuke,or OnionDuke; and CosmicDuke infecting its victims with\nPinchDuke,GeminiDuke or MiniDuke.\n\n## DECOYS\n\nThe Dukes commonly employ decoys with their infection vectors. These decoys may be image\nfiles, document files, Adobe Flash videos or similar that are presented to the victim during\nthe infection process in an attempt to distract them from the malicious activity. The contents\nof these decoys range from non-targeted material such as videos of television commercials\nshowing monkeys at an office, to highly targeted documents with content directly relevant to the\nintended recipient such as reports, invitations, or lists of participants to an event.\n\nUsually, the contents of the decoys appear to be taken from public sources, either by copying\npublicly accessible material such as a news report or by simply repurposing a legitimate file that\nhas been openly distributed. In some cases however, highly targeted decoys have been observed\nusing content that does not appear to be publicly available, suggesting that these contents may\nhave been stolen from other victims that had been infected by Duke toolsets.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n## EXPLOITATION OF VULNERABILITIES\n\nThe Dukes have employed exploits both in their infection vectors as well as in their malware. We\nare however only aware of one instance - the exploitation of CVE-2013-0640 to deploy MiniDuke\n\n- where we believe the exploited vulnerability was a zero-day at the time that the group acquired\nthe exploit. In all known cases where exploits were employed, we believe the Dukes did not\nthemselves discover the vulnerabilities or design the original exploits; for the exploited zero-day,\nwe believe the Dukes purchased the exploit. In all other cases, we believe the group simply\nrepurposed publicly available exploits or proofs of concept.\n\n## ATTRIBUTION AND STATE-SPONSORSHIP\n\nAttribution is always a difficult question, but attempting to answer it is important in understanding\nthese types of threats and how to defend against them. This paper has already stated that we\nbelieve the Dukes to be a Russian state-sponsored cyberespionage operation. To reach this\nconclusion, we began by analyzing the apparent objectives and motivations of the group.\n\nBased on what we currently know about the targets chosen by the Dukes over the past 7 years,\nthey appear to have consistently targeted entities that deal with foreign policy and security policy\nmatters. These targets have included organizations such as ministries of foreign affairs, embassies,\nsenates, parliaments, ministries of defense, defense contractors, and think tanks.\n\nIn one of their more intriguing cases, the Dukes have appeared to also target entities involved\nin the trafficking of illegal drugs. Even such targets however appear to be consistent with the\noverarching theme, given the drug trade’s relevance to security policy. Based on this, we are\nconfident in our conclusion that the Dukes’ primary mission is the collection of intelligence to\nsupport foreign and security policy decision-making.\n\nThis naturally leads to the question of state-sponsorship. Based on our establishment of the\ngroup’s primary mission, we believe the main benefactor (or benefactors) of their work is a\ngovernment. But are the Dukes a team or a department inside a government agency? An external\ncontractor? A criminal gang selling to the highest bidder? A group of tech-savvy patriots? We\ndon’t know.\n\nBased on the length of the Dukes’ activity, our estimate of the amount of resources invested in\nthe operation and the fact that their activity only appears to be increasing, we believe the group\nto have significant and most critically, stable financial backing. The Dukes have consistently\noperated large-scale campaigns against high-profile targets while concurrently engaging in\nsmaller, more targeted campaigns with apparent coordination and no evidence of unintentional\noverlap or operational clashes. We therefore believe the Dukes to be a single, large, wellcoordinated organization with clear separation of responsibilities and targets.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Dukes appear to prioritize the continuation of their operations over stealth. Their 2015\nCozyDuke and CloudDuke campaigns take this to the extreme by apparently opting for speed and\nquantity over stealth and quality. In the most extreme case, the Dukes continued with their July\n2015 CloudDuke campaign even after their activity had been outed by multiple security vendors.\nWe therefore believe the Dukes’ primary mission to be so valuable to their benefactors that its\ncontinuation outweighs everything else.\n\nThis apparent disregard for publicity suggests, in our opinion, that the benefactors of the Dukes\nis so powerful and so tightly connected to the group that the Dukes are able to operate with\nno apparent fear of repercussions on getting caught. We believe the only benefactor with the\npower to offer such comprehensive protection would be the government of the nation from\nwhich the group operates. We therefore believe the Dukes to work either within or directly for a\ngovernment, thus ruling out the possibility of a criminal gang or another third party.\n\nThis leaves us with the final question: which country? We are unable to conclusively prove\nresponsibility of any specific country for the Dukes. All of the available evidence however does in\nour opinion suggest that the group operates on behalf of the Russian Federation. Further, we are\ncurrently unaware of any evidence disproving this theory.\n\nKaspersky Labs has previously noted the presence of Russian-language artefacts in some of\nthe Duke malware samples [[9]]. We have also found a Russian-language error message in many\nPinchDuke samples: “Ошибка названия модуля! Название секции данных должно\nбыть 4 байта!” This roughly translates as, “There is an error in the module’s name! The length\nof the data section name must be 4 bytes!”\n\nAdditionally, Kaspersky noted that based on the compilation timestamps, the authors of the Duke\nmalware appear to primarily work from Monday to Friday between the times of 6am and 4pm\nUTC+0 [[11]]. This corresponds to working hours between 9am and 7pm in the UTC+3 time zone,\nalso known as Moscow Standard Time, which covers, among others, much of western Russia,\nincluding Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\nThe Kaspersky Labs analysis of the Duke malware authors’ working times is supported by our own\nanalysis, as well as that performed by FireEye [[22]]. This assertion of time zone is also supported by\ntimestamps found in many GeminiDuke samples, which similarly suggest the group work in the\nMoscow Standard Time timezone, as further detailed in the section on the technical analysis of\nGeminiDuke (page 23).\n\nFinally, the known targets of the Dukes - Eastern European foreign ministries, western think tanks\nand governmental organizations, even Russian-speaking drug dealers - conform to publiclyknown Russian foreign policy and security policy interests. Even though the Dukes appear to\nhave targeted governments all over the world, we are unaware of them ever targeting the Russian\ngovernment. While absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, it is an interesting detail to\nnote.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the presented evidence and analysis, we believe, with a high level of confidence, that\nthe Duke toolsets are the product of a single, large, well-resourced organization (which we\nidentify as the Dukes) that provides the Russian government with intelligence on foreign and\nsecurity policy matters in exchange for support and protection.\n\nF-Secure Whitepaper, September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n## BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n**1.** The White House; Remarks By President Barack Obama In Prague As Delivered; published 5 April 2009; [Online].\n\n[Available: https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-barack-obama-prague-delivered](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-barack-obama-prague-delivered)\n**2.** [Wikipedia; KavKaz Center; [Online].
