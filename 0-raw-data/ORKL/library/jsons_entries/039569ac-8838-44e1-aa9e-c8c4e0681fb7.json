These campaigns primarily targeted US companies in various industries including retail,\nentertainment, pharmacy, and others that commonly employ online payments, such as online shopping\nportals.\n\nThe actor sending these campaigns attempts to establish rapport with potential victims by abusing\nLinkedIn’s direct messaging service. In direct follow-up emails, the actor pretends to be from a staffing\ncompany with an offer of employment. In many cases, the actor supports the campaigns with fake\nwebsites that impersonate legitimate staffing companies. These websites, however, host the malicious\npayloads. In other cases, the actor uses a range of malicious attachments to distribute More_eggs.\n\nWe also believe that the same actor recently sent related campaigns, first noted by Brian Krebs, targeting\nanti-money laundering officers at financial institutions [1].\n\n**Delivery**\n\nWe have observed a number of variations among the campaigns, but most share common\ncharacteristics. While not exhaustive, the general flow as well as specific examples of these attacks are\ndescribed below.\n\nInitially the actor uses a fraudulent, but legitimately created LinkedIn profile to initiate contact with\nindividuals at the targeted company by sending invitations with a short message (Figure 1). This appears\nas a benign email with the subject “Hi [Name], please add me to your professional network”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Example of initial message in which attackers abuse LinkedIn messaging._\n\nWithin a week, the actor sends a direct email to the target’s work address reminding the recipient about\nthe prior attempt to communicate on LinkedIn (Figure 2). It uses the target’s professional title, as it\nappears on LinkedIn, as the subject, and often suggests the recipient click on a link to see the noted job\ndescription. In other cases, this actor used an attached PDF with embedded URLs or other malicious\nattachments.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Example follow up email to the target’s work address, with a malicious URL._\n\nThe URLs link to a landing page that spoofs a real talent and staffing management company, using stolen\nbranding to enhance the legitimacy of the campaigns (Figure 3). The landing page initiates a download of\na Microsoft Word file (Figure 4) with malicious macros created with Taurus Builder (described below). If\nthe recipient enables macros, the “More_eggs” payload will be downloaded and executed. In other cases,\nthe landing page may initiate the download of a JScript loader instead, but this intermediate malware still\nultimately results in the delivery of More_eggs.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Example of a landing page for the URL included in email using stolen branding and a lookalike_\n_domain for a talent management agency. This one specifically initiates a download of a malicious_\n_Microsoft Word document._\n\n_Figure 4: Example malicious Microsoft Word document that uses macros to download More_eggs._\n\n\n-----\n\nAs noted, some campaigns also used malicious attachments instead of URLs in the email. Figure 5\nshows an example of one such attachment, a PDF with a link to a spoofed landing page like that shown\nin Figure 3.\n\n_Figure 5: Example PDF attachment that contains a malicious URL._\n\nVariations\n\nThese campaigns demonstrated considerable variability, with the actor frequently changing delivery\nmethods and more. Examples of the types of techniques used by the actor to deliver the final More_eggs\npayload include:\n\n\n-----\n\nURL linking to a landing page that initiates the download for an intermediate JScript loader or\nMicrosoft Word document with macros or exploits\nURL shortener redirecting to the same landing page\nPDF attachment with a URL linking to the same landing page\nPassword-protected Microsoft Word attachment with macros that download More_eggs\nCompletely benign emails without a malicious attachment or URL attempting to further establish\nrapport (Figure 6)\n\n_Figure 6: Example of a benign email designed to establish rapport with potential victims_\n\n**Tools**\n\nThis actor uses a variety of tools to distribute malware. We briefly describe three such tools below.\n\n**Taurus Builder**\n\nWe use this name to describe a tool used to create malicious documents. We believe Taurus builder was\npurchased on underground crime forums. Notably, documents created with this builder use the CMSTP\nbypass as described in [2]. Both Palo Alto Networks [3] and QuoScient [4] have previously described\ndocuments created with this kit.\n\n**VenomKit**\n\nWe use this name to describe documents generated by a builder purchased from the same seller as\nTaurus builder. Depending on the variant it may exploit CVE-2017-0199, CVE-2017-8570, CVE-20178759, CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0802, and/or CVE-2018-8174. Notably, VenomKit often also uses the\nsame CMSTP bypass as Taurus. Documents from this kit have previously been discussed by Quoscient\n\n[4].\n\n**More_eggs**\n\n\n-----\n\nMore_eggs is malware written in JScript used in these campaigns and others. It is often used as a\ndownloader. In addition to its ability to download additional payloads, More_eggs has extensive\ncapabilities to profile the infected machine. The malware was first documented by Trend Micro [5].\n\n**Overlaps with Anti-Money Laundering Campaign**\n\n[Brian Krebs wrote about a related campaign that targeted anti-money laundering officers at financial](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/02/phishers-target-anti-money-laundering-officers-at-u-s-credit-unions/)\ninstitutions that we believe may have been sent by the same actor. Although targeting and the final\npayload were different in the campaign he described, key similarities to campaigns describe above\nincluded:\n\nThe use of a similar PDF email attachment to the PDFs used in the Fake Jobs campaigns\nThe PDFs of both the anti-money laundering campaign and the Fake Jobs campaigns at one point\nincluded URLs hosted on the same domain\n\n**Large Follow-up Spam Campaign**\n\nNote: As we were finalizing this report we observed a larger than usual campaign from this actor on Feb\n21, 2019, from random senders, with a malicious URL in the email.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAs threat actors continue to turn away from very large-scale “spray and pray” campaigns and focus on\npersistent infections with downloaders, RATs, bankers, and other malware, increasingly sophisticated\nsocial engineering and stealthy malware are making their way into a range of campaigns. This actor\nprovides compelling examples of these new approaches, using LinkedIn scraping, multi-vector and\nmultistep contacts with recipients, personalized lures, and varied attack techniques to distribute the\nMore_eggs downloader, which in turn can distribute the malware of their choice based on system profiles\ntransmitted to the threat actor. In response to the increasing effectiveness of layered defenses and end\nuser education efforts, we can expect more threat actors to adopt approaches that improve the\neffectiveness of their lures and increase the likelihood of high-quality infections.\n\nNote: We have informed all affected parties about the abuse of their services and brands in these\ncampaigns.\n\n**References**\n\n[1]https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/02/phishers-target-anti-money-laundering-officers-at-u-s-creditunions/\n\n[2]https://bohops.com/2018/02/26/leveraging-inf-sct-fetch-execute-techniques-for-bypass-evasionpersistence/\n\n[3]https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-new-techniques-uncover-attribute-cobalt-gang-commoditybuilders-infrastructure-revealed/\n\n[4]https://medium.com/@quoscient/golden-chickens-uncovering-a-malware-as-a-service-maas-providerand-two-new-threat-actors-using-61cf0cb87648\n\n[5]https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/backdoor-carrying-emails-set-sights-onrussian-speaking-businesses/\n\n\n-----\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n**IOC** **IOC Type** **Description**\n\ninterrafcu[.]com Domain Landing\nPage\nDomain\n\nusstaffing[.]services Domain Landing\nPage\nDomain\n\nedb39c4eb28cf526f1e606365cdef009cb9aa8ba99feb448db615326bf495042 SHA256 Example\nTaurus\nBuilder\nDocument\n\nhxxp://204.155.30[.]109/3521.txt URL Document\nPayload\n\nd39cb07e97fd91e75c51f75ccef1a8d7ce8ec8c951943501f981ce98d6319e01 SHA256 Scriptlet\nleading to\nMore_eggs\n\n2bca33c8be6483aec5cbb29d18c5f626a86205fca92191468b8b1032d38aebea SHA256 Example\nVenomKit\nDocument\n\n2470ac1632546ecf5c9c9d93c6dc088253ba682ba9cf19ae6984b6cee3f8e2b5 SHA256 Example\nCode\nSigned JS\nLoader\n\n73defd8066549e5b09c509064bc5bd29e77eca2c18d114c0bcf3dfa1cefe6939 SHA256 Example JS\nLoader\n\nmail[.]rediffmail[.]kz HostName More_Eggs\nC&C\n\nonlinemail[.]kz HostName More_Eggs\nC&C\n\napi[.]cloudservers[.]kz HostName More_Eggs\nC&C\n\nsecure[.]cloudserv[.]ink HostName More_Eggs\nC&C\n\n\n-----\n\ntonsandmillions[.]com HostName More_Eggs\nC&C\n\ncontactlistsagregator[.]com HostName More_Eggs\nC&C\n\n**ET and ETPRO Suricata/Snort Signatures**\n\n2832245 | ETPRO CURRENT_EVENTS Possible More_eggs Connectivity Check\n\n2834137 | ETPRO TROJAN Observed Malicious SSL Cert (More_eggs CnC)\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
