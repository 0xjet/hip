While we have seen these threats in the past, only recently have\nRansomware operators, such as Maze, actually followed through.\n\nIn a new post to a Russian malware and hacker forum shared with us by security\n[researcher Damian, the public-facing representative of the REvil ransomware known as](https://twitter.com/Damian1338)\nUNKN states that a new \"division\" has been created for large operations.\n\nThey claim that a recent operation from this group is the attack against the CyrusOne data\ncenter that was reported last week. As part of this operation, UNKN claims that they have\nstolen files from the company before encrypting their network.\n\nREvil goes on to say that if a company does not pay the ransom, the ransomware actors\nwill publicly release the stolen data or sell it to competitors. It is in their opinion that this\nwould be more costly to the victim than paying the ransom.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Forum post by REvil operator**\nThe original Russian text from the above post is below:\n```\nЕсли не отвечаем - значит не интересны. Либо мест нет.\nМы открыли отдельное подразделение, которое занимается крупными операциями. Неделю\nназад был осуществлен доступ к CyrusOne. Судя по СМИ - платить они не собираются.\nОчень жаль. Тактика \"потратим 100 миллионов на восстановление с нуля, чем 15 на\nвыкуп\" такая же эффективная, как и оправдания Гарика Куколда Харламова. Инвесторам\nпотом будете объяснять, где выгода. Каждая атака сопровождается копированием\nкоммерческой информации. В случае отказа выплаты - данные будут либо проданы\nконкурентам, либо выкладываться в открытые источники. GDPR. Не хотите платить нам платите в х10 раз больше правительству. Нет проблем.\nОчень странно, что cdhfund.com до сих пор молчат. Они также были подвержены атаке,\nвсе данные скопированы и зашифрованы. В случае отказа - наши действия обозначены\nвыше.\n\n```\nThe English translation via Google Translate can also be read below:\n```\nIf we don’t answer, then it’s not interesting. Or there are no places.\nWe have opened a separate division, which is engaged in large operations. A week\nago, access to CyrusOne was made. Judging by the media, they are not going to pay.\nVery sorry. The “spend 100 million to restore from scratch than 15 to buy” tactics\nare as effective as Garik Kukold Kharlamov’s excuses. Then you will explain to\ninvestors where the benefits are. Each attack is accompanied by a copy of commercial\ninformation. In case of refusal of payment - the data will either be sold to\ncompetitors or laid out in open sources. GDPR . Do not want to pay us - pay x10\ntimes more to the government. No problems.\nIt is very strange that cdhfund.com is still silent. They were also susceptible to\nattack, all data was copied and encrypted. In case of failure - our actions are\nindicated above.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n## Ransomware attacks are now data breaches\n\nFor years, ransomware developers and affiliates have been telling victims that they must\npay the ransom or stolen data would be publicly released.\n\nWhile it has been a well-known secret that ransomware actors snoop through victim's data,\nand in many cases steal it before the data is encrypted, they never actually carried out their\nthreats of releasing it.\n\nThis all changed at the end of November when Maze Ransomware threatened Allied\nUniversal that if they did not pay the ransom, they would release their files. When they did\n[not receive a payment, they released 700MB worth of data on a hacking forum.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/allied-universal-breached-by-maze-ransomware-stolen-data-leaked/)\n\n**Public disclosure of Allied Universal data**\nDuring ransomware attacks, some threat actors have told companies that they are familiar\nwith internal company secrets after reading the company's files. Even though this should be\nconsidered a data breach, many ransomware victims simply swept it under the rug in the\nhopes that nobody would ever find out.\n\nNow that ransomware operators are releasing victim's data, this will need to change and\ncompanies will have to treat these attacks like data breaches.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is because employee medical records, personal information, termination letters,\nsalaries, and much more can potentially be disclosed. Furthermore, if any third-party\ninformation is stolen, which is highly likely, then that requires further disclosure as well.\n\nIt is too soon to say whether these new tactics will push companies to treat ransomware\nattacks like data breaches, but as more ransomware developers publish stolen documents,\nwe can expect lawsuits and public concern to rise.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[Snap-on discloses data breach claimed by Conti ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/snap-on-discloses-data-breach-claimed-by-conti-ransomware-gang/)\n\n[Shutterfly discloses data breach after Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shutterfly-discloses-data-breach-after-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-exposes-data-of-500-000-chicago-students/)\n\n[Data Breach](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-breach/)\n[Data Exfiltration](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-exfiltration/)\n[Extortion](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/extortion/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[REvil](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/revil/)\n[Sodinokibi](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/sodinokibi/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.

Also it could be argued that the\nencryption of data by a malicious 3rd party could be unlawful \"alteration\" therefore\nagain a data breach in the eyes of the GDPR.
