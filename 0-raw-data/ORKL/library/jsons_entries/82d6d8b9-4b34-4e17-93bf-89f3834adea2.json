    "plain_text": "# APT trends report Q1 2019\n\n**securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q1-2019/90643**\n\nBy GReAT\n\nFor just under two years, the Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at\nKaspersky Lab has been publishing quarterly summaries of advanced persistent threat\n(APT) activity. The summaries are based on our threat intelligence research and provide\na representative snapshot of what we have published and discussed in greater detail in\nour private APT reports. They aim to highlight the significant events and findings that we\nfeel people should be aware of.\n\nThis is our latest installment, focusing on activities that we observed during Q1 2019.\n\nReaders who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more\ninformation on a specific report are encouraged to contact ‘intelreports@kaspersky.com’.\n\n## The most remarkable finding\n\nTargeting supply-chains has proved very successful for attackers in recent years –\n[ShadowPad, CCleaner and](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/) [ExPetr are good examples. In our threat predictions for](https://securelist.com/expetrpetyanotpetya-is-a-wiper-not-ransomware/78902/)\n2019, we flagged this as a likely continuing attack vector; and we didn’t have to wait very\nlong to see this prediction come true. In January, we discovered a sophisticated supplychain attack involving the ASUS Live Update Utility, the mechanism used to deliver\nBIOS, UEFI and software updates to ASUS laptops and desktops. The attackers behind\n“Operation ShadowHammer” added a backdoor to the utility and then distributed it to\nusers through official channels. The goal of the attack was to target with precision an\nunknown pool of users, identified by their network adapter MAC addresses. The\nattackers were found to have hardcoded a list of MAC addresses into the Trojanized\nsamples, representing the true targets of this massive operation. We were able to extract\nover 600 unique MAC addresses from more than 200 samples discovered in this attack,\nalthough it’s possible that other samples exist that target different MAC addresses.\n\n## Russian-speaking activity\n\nRussian-speaking groups were not especially active during the first part of the year, with\nno noteworthy technical or operational changes. However, they continued their non-stop\nactivity in terms of spreading, with a special interest in political activity.\n\nThis was apparent in an attack focused on the Ukraine elections. The attack surfaced\nafter we discovered a malicious Word document targeting a German political advisory\norganization. This organization, according to its website, “advises political decisionmakers on international politics and foreign and security policy”. Our technical analysis of\nthe attack suggests that the Sofacy or Hades groups are behind it, though we’re unable\nto say for sure which of these groups is responsible.\n\n\n-----\n\nSuch political interests are not new. Recently, a court in Virginia gave Microsoft control of\na group of websites that were intended to look like login sites for a Washington think\ntank, but are believed to be part of the infrastructure of a “Russian group suspected in\nthe DNC hack”.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft revealed that a “Russian nation-state hacking group” targeted\npolitical organizations engaged in the 2019 European Parliament elections scheduled for\nthe end of May.\n\nOn the technical side, since mid-January we have been tracking an active Turla\ncampaign targeting government bodies in Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. This time the\nactor delivered its known KopiLuwak JavaScript using new .NET malware, called\n“Topinambour” (aka Sunchoke) by its developers. The Topinambour dropper is delivered\nalong with legitimate software and consists of a tiny .NET shell that waits for Windows\nshell commands from operators. Interestingly, in this campaign the attackers used\ndifferent artefacts implemented in JavaScript, .NET and PowerShell – all of them with\nsimilar functionality.\n\nWe also published details on how [Zebrocy has added the “Go” language to its arsenal –](https://securelist.com/a-zebrocy-go-downloader/89419/)\nthe first time that we have observed a well-known APT threat actor deploy malware with\nthis compiled, open source language. Zebrocy continues to target government-related\norganizations in Central Asia, both in-country and in remote locations, as well as a new\ndiplomatic target in the Middle East.\n\nFinally, during February 2019 we observed a highly targeted attack in Crimea using a\npreviously unknown malware. The spy program was spread by email and masqueraded\nas the VPN-client of a well-known Russian security company that, among other things,\nprovides solutions to protect networks. At this point we can’t relate this activity to any\nknown actor.\n\n## Chinese-speaking activity\n\nRecent APT trend summaries included analyses of new Chinese-speaking threat actors\nas well as the resurgence of old activity sets. This has continued into 2019.\n\nIn the early months of 2019, Chinese-speaking actors were the most active, with a\ntraditional interest in targeting different countries in South East Asia. A recent indictment\nof two Chinese nationals by the US Department of Justice on charges of computer\nhacking, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, alleged that they\nwere members of the APT10 group, carrying out illegal activity on behalf of the Chinese\nMinistry of State Security.\n\nSimilarly, CactusPete (aka LoneRanger, Karma Panda, and Tonto Team), is reported to\nhave targeted South Korean, Japanese, US, and Taiwanese organizations in the 2012 –\n2014 timeframe. The actor has quite likely relied on much the same codebase and\nimplant variants for the past six years. However these have broadened substantially\nsince 2018. The group spear-phishes its targets, deploys Word and Equation Editor\nexploits and an appropriated/repackaged DarkHotel VBScript zero-day, delivers modified\nand compiled unique Mimikatz variants, GSEC and WCE credential stealers, a\n\n\n-----\n\nkeylogger, various Escalation of Privilege exploits, various older utilities and an updated\nset of backdoors, and what appear to be new variants of custom downloader and\nbackdoor modules.\n\nWe have been monitoring a campaign targeting Vietnamese government and diplomatic\nentities abroad since at least April 2018. We attribute the campaign, which we call\n“SpoiledLegacy”, to the LuckyMouse APT group (aka EmissaryPanda and APT27). The\noperators use penetration testing frameworks such as Cobalt Strike and Metasploit.\nWhile we believe that they exploit network services vulnerabilities as their main initial\ninfection vector, we have also seen spear-phishing messages containing decoy\ndocuments. We believe that, as in a previous LuckyMouse campaign internal database\nservers are among the targets. For the last stage of their attack they use different inmemory 32- and 64-bit Trojans injected into system process memory. It is worth\nhighlighting that all the tools in the infection chain dynamically obfuscate Win32 API calls\nusing leaked HackingTeam code.\n\nFireEye defined APT40 as the Chinese state-sponsored threat actor previously reported\nas TEMP.Periscope, Leviathan and TEMP.Jumper. According to FireEye, the group has\nconducted operations in support of China’s naval modernisation effort since at least\n2013, specifically targeting engineering, transportation and defence industries, especially\nwhere these sectors overlap with maritime technologies. Recently, FireEye also\nobserved specific targeting of countries strategically important to the “Belt and Road”\nInitiative, including Cambodia, Belgium, Germany, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaysia,\nNorway, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nInterestingly, the use of newer ANEL versions by APT10, targeting Japan, allowed us to\nfind similarities between this malware and Emdivi, malware previously used by\nBlueTermite. This suggests a potential connection between both actors.\n\n## South East Asia and Korean peninsula\n\nOnce again, this seems to be the most active region of the world in terms of APT activity.\n\nIn January, we identified new activity by the Transparent Tribe APT group (aka\nPROJECTM and MYTHIC LEOPARD), a threat actor with interests aligned with Pakistan\nthat has shown a persistent focus on Indian military targets.\n\nIn February, we identified a campaign targeting military organizations, this time in India.\nWe are currently unable to attribute this campaign to any known threat actor. The\nattackers rely on watering-holes and spear-phishing to infect their victims. Specifically,\nthey were able to compromise a website belonging to a think tank related to warfare\nstudies, using it to host a malicious document that distributed a variant of the Netwire\nRAT. We also found evidence of a compromised welfare club for military personnel\ndistributing the same malware during the same time period.\n\nOceanLotus was another actor active during this period, using a new downloader called\nKerrDown, as reported by Palo Alto. The actor was discovered at the beginning of the\nyear using freshly-compiled samples in a new wave of attacks. ESET recently uncovered\na new addition to this actor’s toolset targeting Mac OS.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In mid-2018, our report on Operation](https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/) [AppleJeus highlighted the focus of the Lazarus](https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/)\nthreat actor on cryptocurrency exchanges. In this operation, the group used a fake\ncompany with a backdoored product aimed at cryptocurrency businesses. One of the\nkey findings was the group’s new ability to target Mac OS. Since then, Lazarus has\nexpanded its operations for this platform. Further tracking of the group’s activities has\nenabled us to discover a new operation, active since at least November 2018, which\nutilizes PowerShell to control Windows systems and Mac OS malware to target Apple\ncustomers. Lazarus isn’t the only APT group targeting cryptocurrency exchanges. The\nKimsuky group has also extended its activities to include individuals and companies in\nthis sector, mainly in South Korea.\n\nFinally, at the start of the year, the South Asian Bitter group used a new simple\ndownloader (called ArtraDownloader by Palo Alto) that delivers the BitterRat Trojan to\ntarget organizations in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.\n\n## Middle East\n\nSurprisingly, during the first months of the year activity in the Middle East has,\napparently, been less intense than in the past. Even so, it was the target of several\ngroups already discussed, such as Chafer and Bitter.\n\nWe also observed some activity from Gaza Team and MuddyWater. Still, this can be\nconsidered part of their continued targeting of the region, showing nothing new in terms\nof operational or technical improvements.\n\n## Other interesting discoveries\n\nLate in 2018 we observed a new version of the FinSpy iOS implant in the wild. This is\npart of FinSpy Mobile, a product provided by the surveillance solutions developer,\nGamma Group. FinSpy for iOS implements extensive spyware features that allow\nsomeone to track almost everything on infected devices, including keypresses,\nmessages and calls. A big limitation is that the current version can only be installed on\njailbroken devices. We believe that Gamma Group does not provide an exploit tool to\njailbreak victims’ phones, but it provides advice and support to customers on how to do\nthe jailbreaking themselves. Our telemetry shows implant traces in Indonesia and\nMongolia. However, due to the large number of Gamma customers, this is probably only\na fraction of the victims.\n\nFollowing this research, we discovered a new version for Android also dated circa June\n2018. While it is quite similar in terms of functionality, it implements unique capabilities\nspecific to the platform such as obtaining root privileges by abusing the DirtyCow exploit\n(CVE-2016-5195). Just like the iOS version, this implant has features to exfiltrate data\nfrom Instant Messengers including Threema, Signal, Whatsapp and Telegram, as well as\ninternal device information including, but not limited to, emails and SMS messages.\n\nIn February, our AEP (Automatic Exploit Prevention) systems detected an attempt to\nexploit a vulnerability in Windows – the fourth consecutive exploited Local Privilege\nEscalation vulnerability in Windows that we have recently discovered using our\n\n\n-----\n\ntechnologies. Further analysis led us to uncover a zero-day vulnerability in win32k.sys .\nWe reported this to Microsoft on 22 February. The company confirmed the vulnerability\nand assigned it CVE-2019-0797. Microsoft released a patch on 12 March 2019, crediting\nKaspersky Lab researchers Vasiliy Berdnikov and Boris Larin with the discovery. We\nbelieve that this exploit is being used by several threat actors – including, but possibly\nnot limited to, FruityArmor and SandCat. FruityArmor is known to have used zero-days\nbefore, while SandCat is a new APT actor that we discovered only recently. The exploit\nfound in the wild was targeting 64-bit operating systems in the Windows 8 to Windows\n10 build 15063 range.\n\nFrutiyArmor and SandCat, interestingly, seem to follow parallel paths, both having the\nsame exploits available at the same time. This seems to point to a third party providing\nboth with such artefacts.\n\nRansomware has become an interesting tool for APT actors, as it can be used to delete\ntraces, conduct cyber-sabotage, or as a powerful distraction. There is an interesting\nwave of ransomware attacks that we have been following, as they seem to be mainly\ninterested in big targets. [LockerGoga recently compromised the systems of Altran,](https://threatpost.com/lockergoga-ransomware-norsk-hydro-wiper/143181/) Norsk\nHydro and other companies. It’s unclear who’s behind the attacks, what they want and\nthe mechanism used to first infect its victims. It’s not even clear if LockerGoga is\nransomware or a wiper. The malware encrypts data and displays a ransom asking\nvictims to get in touch to arrange decryption, in return for an (unspecified) payment in\nbitcoins. However, later versions were observed by researchers that forcibly log victims\noff infected systems by changing their passwords and removing their ability to log back\ninto the system. In such cases, the victims may not even get to see the ransom note.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nLooking back at what has happened during the first months of the year is always a\nsurprising experience for us. Even when we have the feeling that “nothing\ngroundbreaking” has occurred, we always uncover a threat landscape that is full of many\ninteresting stories and evolution on different fronts.\n\nIf we are to provide a few general highlights, we can conclude that:\n\nGeopolitics keeps gaining weight as the main driver of APT activity\nSouth East Asia is still the most active region of the world in terms of APT activity,\nbut probably this is also related to the “noise” that some of the less experienced\ngroups make\nRussian-speaking groups keep a low profile in comparison with recent years:\nmaybe this is part of internal restructuring, but this is just a hypothesis\nChinese-speaking actors maintain a high level of activity, combining low and high\nsophistication depending on the campaign\nProviders of “commercial” malware available for governments and other entities\nseem to be doing well, with more customers\n\nIf we are to highlight one thing from the whole period, in our opinion operation\nShadowHammer combines several factors that define the current status of APT activity.\nThis is an advanced and targeted campaign using the supply-chain for distribution on an\n\n\n-----\n\nincredibly wide scale. It involves several steps in a combined operation, including the\ninitial collection of MAC addresses for their targets. This seems to be a new trend, as the\nactor also targeted other victims for malware distribution, showing how worrisome and\ndifficult it is to fight supply-chain attacks.\n\nAs always, this is only our visibility. We always have to keep in mind other sophisticated\nattacks that happen under our radar, but we continue to try and improve, to uncover\nevery single one of them.\n\n\n-----",
