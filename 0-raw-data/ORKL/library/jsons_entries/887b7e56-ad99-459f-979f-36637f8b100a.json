    "plain_text": "# Hello Lionel Richie\n\n**[intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2021/09/20/hello-lionel-richie](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2021/09/20/hello-lionel-richie/)**\n\nintrusiontruth September 20, 2021\n\nAn interesting turn of events occurred whilst releasing our article series on Lonely Lantern\n(the Chinese APT previously with no name, working to the Guangdong SSD).\n\nAs most of our readers will have been aware, a brand new Twitter account was created to\nreply to our tweet in advance of the second article where we exposed Guangdong MSS officer\n1 as Zhao Jianfei, working with Li and Dong to support and direct their intrusion activity\nfrom Chengdu.\n\nAt the time, we noted this post and found it interesting (not least for the gif choice) but put it\non the back burner given other investigations and leads we were following up on. However,\nwhat piqued our interest further was the fact this account and its comment was later deleted.\n\nWhy would Mr. Ren reach out to us on this public forum and tweet that he is the MSS officer\nwe were looking for? Does he have something he wants to get off his chest? The Twitter bio\ntranslates to ‘roaming the streets of Guangzhou’. Seems to fit with the brief of the GSSD.\n\nWe decided to investigate (initially as a bit of fun on a rainy day) but as you will see, it is clear\nthat Ren Yuntao is entwined with Lonely Lantern.\n\nHere’s what we know.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Ren Yuntao (任云韬)\n\nThe Twitter profile is in the name of Ren Yuntao. However, the profile itself is quite sparse,\nhaving being created the same month as posting. And it appears he only engaged with us. A\nkeen watcher of our work? A super fan perhaps.\n\nSo, apart from being a Lionel Ritchie fan, what else could we find on Mr Ren? His Twitter\nprofile didn’t give us much so we decided to start at the beginning and where we know\nhackers from Lonely Lantern reside: Chengdu.\n\nMr. Ren it seems went to the same school as Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi (the indicted hackers\nwe mentioned in Article 1). Ren studied a Masters program at the University of Electronic\nScience and Technology of China (UESTC), in Chengdu.\n\nHis studies led to him gaining experience in the development of software, defense and\nforensic analysis of information systems.\n\n_Department of Computer Science and Engineering Master’s students at UESTC (124 in total). Ren_\n\n_Yuntao’s name appears 8 along in the third para.th_\n\nRen’s Master’s thesis, submitted in December of 2006 is titled “Malicious Code Anti_Detection Technology Research Based on Dynamic Binary Modification” (基于二进制多态_\n变形的恶意代码反检测技术研究). His supervisor whilst completing his studies was Li Yichao\n(李毅超).\n\n\n-----\n\nWe set about delving into Ren’s thesis to see what we could find (it is quite dry in places and\nwe wouldn’t recommend it as bedtime reading). Yet, there are some nteresting nuggets. An\nexample is on page 71. Here, Ren provides his acknowledgement to ‘Pinkeyes’, a ‘famous\nnetwork security figure within China’, referring to him as his ‘comrade in arms’. An\ninteresting phrase to use.\n\nLater, on page 74, Ren details his research projects and achievements throughout his\ngraduate studies. Of specific note to us was his involvement in the ‘design and realisation of\n_a Sichuan State Security Department (SSSD) programme’._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Highlighted section: Mention of Sichuan SSD in Ren’s thesis_\n\nThe last accomplishment Ren lists (point 6) is his participation as a “core technician in a\n_“major” university project with designator XXX”. Suspicious – a project so sensitive it needs_\nto be redacted but high profile enough to include in a thesis detailing your work\nachievements…\n\nFollowing on from his success with sensitive projects and MSS programmes in Sichuan, Ren\nappears to have been quite busy, staying on at UESTC as a post-grad and publishing two\npapers. One of which was on the topic of detecting malware on registry Hive files.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Li Yichao (李毅超)\n\nCited in Ren’s papers and listed as Ren’s supervisor at the UESTC is Li Yichao (李毅超). It\nwas Mr Ren himself who wrote that Li Yichao gave him the National Network Security\nprogramme opportunity. So, who is Li Yichao?\n\nWell, here is his CV.\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven he is an academic, his openness is our advantage. He notes his many plaudits,\nincluding ‘winning second prize from a certain ministry of the country’ and states some of\nhis many students have gone on to work for ‘public and national security\n_departments’. Could Ren be one of these individuals?_\n\nLet’s recap: Ren has worked closely with a supervisor who openly talks of his links to\ngovernment bodies and ministries within China. Ren himself has commented on his time\nworking for the Sichuan State Security Department and other mysterious organisations that\nrequire redacted material whilst at UESTC. So what else can we find on Ren following his\ndeparture from academia?\n\n## Chengdu Jiuyan Technology Company Ltd. (成都九眼科技有限公司)\n\nAlso known as Chengdu Nine Eyes Technology Co Ltd., this company was established in July\n2018 specialising in technology development, computer software and network engineering.\n\n\n-----\n\nTwo individuals are associated with the company. The first is the supervisor Xu Jiayou (徐嘉\n幼), holding just 1% of the company. The second is the executive director and general\nmanager Ren Yuntao, with a registered stake of 99% in Chengdu Jiuyan.\n\nThe address is listed as Room 1, Floor 1, Building 1, 56 Changjiang East Second Street,\nHuayang Avenue, Tianfu New District, Chengdu.\n\nInterestingly, there are a number of other companies who also claim to reside in Room 1,\nFloor 1 Building 1 of 56 Changjiang East Second Street in Chengdu including:\n\n\n-----\n\nChengdu Hashmai Block Technology Co. Ltd\nSichuan Shuanglin Jiayue Property Management Co. Ltd\nShuju Chengdu Technology Co. Ltd\nDouxing Culture Communications Chengdu Co. Ltd\nChengdu Yinchi Culture Media Co. Ltd\nChengdu Vines Interactive Entertainment Technology Co. Ltd\nChengdu Tianfu Hualong Petroleum Co. Ltd\nChengdu Renhe Daoyuan Enterprise Management Consulting Co. Ltd\nChengdu Jingwei Zhidao Enterprise Management Consulting Co. Ltd\nChengdu Feihang Zhiyun Technology Co. Ltd\nChengdu Als Technology Co. Ltd\nChengdu Aiweili Trading Co. Ltd\n\nThat’s a lot of companies to be sharing 1 room.\n\nGiven it location, lack of internet presence and the individuals associated with it – a front\ncompany springs to mind.\n\n## Lingma Information Technology Company Limited (凌码信息技术上海 有限公司)\n\nUpon leaving academia, Ren appears to have obtained a job in the private sector as the Head\nof Information Security at Lingma Information Technology Co. Ltd. Once again, all roads\nlead back to Chengdu.\n\nThis is an extract of a book written by UESTC masters alumnus Xu Sheng from the Network\nAttack and Defense Lab, to which Ren Yuntao offers his review.\n\n_Ren Yuntao book review of 游戏外挂攻防艺术 (The Art of Game Plugin: Attack and Defense) by 徐胜 (Xu_\n\n_Sheng)_\n\nHead of Information Security sounds like a grand title. The company Ren worked for\n(Lingma) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Singapore’s Nyber company. Nyber was\nestablished in 2010 under CEO Zhang Taiyong（张台涌). It is described as a company\ncommitted to research and development of high-end technology, with its business scope\ncovering China and overseas regions and its products often being used in government fields.\n\nLingma has a base in Chengdu. The address is given as Area C, Floor 10, Sector F of the 9th\nBuilding of High-Tech Incubation Park Tianfu Avenue Gaoxin District Chengdu\n\n\n-----\n\nDoes this address seem familiar? It did to us. It is in the same high tech zone as Chengdu\nHanke, the front company created by Dong Jiazhi and exposed in article 1 of our series on\nLonely Lantern.\n\n_Company profile of Lingma_\n\nJust like déjà vu, our searching led us back to UESTC in Chengdu. In 2014, Lingma were\nadvertising positions within its company on the UESTC webpage (www1.cduestc.cn), aiming\nto recruit system software engineers, interface software engineers, and information security\nevaluation managers. Could this be where Ren first came across Lingma and led to his career\nin ‘Information Security’?\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Lingma scholarship at SWPU\n\nFurther searches around Lingma shows the company’s ties to other universities in Chengdu.\nFor example, it provides a scholarship program with Southwest Petroleum University\n[(https://www.swpu.edu.cn/info/1248/1113.html) at an investment of 3000 RMB per year.](https://www.swpu.edu.cn/info/1248/1113.html)\n\nBrowsing the website for SWPU, there are a number of articles outlining Lingma’s\ninvolvement with the university under its scholarship scheme.\n\n[One particular article caught our eye. It was posted on the 9 June 2016, and describes howth](http://swpu.edu.cn/scs/info/1045/3399)\nthe scholarship awarding ceremony for the Lingma Scholarship took place a day earlier at\nSWPU.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt states that the director of the institute, ZHAO Gang (学院院长赵刚), was present at the\nceremony and gave a speech to the students. The Deputy Secretary of the institute’s party\ncommittee, YU Hui (学院党委副书记余辉) was also present alongside Secretary LIU Xiang\nfrom the institute’s group committee, who hosted the event (学院团委书记刘翔). The person\nrepresenting the Chengdu R&D Centre of the Lingma Company is named as a Mr. Ren\nWeitao (凌码信息技术有限公司成都研发中心负责人任伟韬先生).\n\nIs it a coincidence that another Mr. Ren also works for the same company as our Mr. Ren?\nWe don’t believe in coincidences. Given that Lingma only has up to 50 staff, and our searches\nrevealed nothing further on any other Ren’s working for Lingma during this time, it is safe to\nassume that Ren Weitao is Ren Yuntao. Was the change in name a deliberate attempt to fly\nunder the radar? What was Ren trying to hide?\n\nThe last picture in the article is interesting and appears to depict Mr. Ren. The students are\nproudly displaying their awards. The caption of this group photo describes those in the\npicture, including the”scholarship-receiving representatives [students], the scholarshipawarding guests [Ren Weitao (任伟韬)] and the leader”.\n\n_Disclaimer: We have obfuscated the students in this image due to their_\n\n_lack of involvement in APT activity_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo what do we know?\n\n1. An individual called Ren Yuntao tweeted his implication that he was the MSS officer\n\nassociated with the APT group (Lonely Lantern) working out of Chengdu and for the\nGuangdong SSD.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Ren Yuntao attended the same university as the indicted criminal hackers for Lonely\n\nLantern and has worked with the Sichuan SSD whilst at university. His university\nprofessor also likes to talk of his close links to the MSS.\n3. Ren Yuntao sets up a front company in Chengdu High-Tech Incubation Park in Tianfu\n\nHigh Tech zone, suspiciously similar to Chengdu Hanke (linked to Dong Jiazhi from\nArticle 1 in this series).\n4. Ren Yuntao works for Lingma and is directly involved with local universities in\n\nChengdu, handing out scholarships to students and providing apprenticeships to\nsupport their ‘cyber security’ effort.\n\nIf it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck…\n\nRen – I know you were keen to talk:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
