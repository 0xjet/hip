This group works\non behalf of the Iranian government and has been observed targeting victims mostly across\nthe Middle Eastern region. They have targeted a variety of industries, including financial,\ngovernment, energy, chemical, and telecommunications, and has primarily focused its\noperations within the Middle East. This adversary was originally identified and tracked as two\nseparate groups, OilRig and APT34. But further research and evidence revealed an overlap\nbetween their activities, and eventually, most researchers agreed to track them as a single\nThreat Actor. Most recently in mid-2019, Turla (Cyber-espionage group from Russia)\nhijacked the Infrastructure of this APT, in one of their attack campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Which organizations have they targeted?\n\nThe group was initially observed targeting financial organizations and government agencies\nacross the Middle Eastern region and the US, but gradually it moved to other regions and\nsectors.\n\nSince 2014, the group’s attacks were focused on Middle Eastern banks and\ngovernment entities since 2014. Later, their primary targets changed, but the trend of\ntargeting critical infrastructure and governmental entities remained the same.\nIn October 2016, the group was observed to be targeting government entities in Middle\nEastern countries and the U.S., along with several airlines from Middle Eastern\ncountries.\nBetween 2017 to 2018, the group focused more on Western-Asian and North American\norganizations working in Education, Information Technology and Government sector.\nIn April 2019, information leaked by elite hackers “Lab Dookhtegan” and “Mr_L4nnist3r”\nrevealed the victim’s names as the Saudi Arabian Communications & Information\nTechnology Commission, Dubai Statistics Association.\nIn the same duration, a small handful of targets were based outside the Middle East,\nincluding a telecom company in Zimbabwe, government bodies in Albania, and South\nKorean gaming business.\nMost recently in June 2019, a phishing campaign was observed, targeting energy\ncompanies, government utilities, and their workers.\n\n## What is their motivation behind the attacks?\n\nThis group is known to use various malware and tools to collect strategic information that\nwould benefit the economic and geopolitical interests of the state of Iran. Also, Iran considers\ncyber-attacks as an offensive weapon against its rival countries like the United States of\nAmerica and Israel. The cyberattacks linked to the group are not that advanced or\nsophisticated, but highly persistent with their victim choice, which is directly or indirectly\nconnected to Iran’s military, financial, and political interests.\n\n## Modus Operandi\n\n\n-----\n\nSince 2014, the group is known to be using Microsoft Excel macros, PowerShell-based\nexploits, and social engineering to gain access to its targets. They use phishing emails to\ndeliver weaponized Microsoft Excel documents, and most of their malware infect the target\nsystem with VisualBasic and PowerShell (.ps1) scripts.\n\nBetween 2014 to 2016, the group's attack campaigns targeted banks and technology\norganizations in Saudi Arabia with phishing emails that included weaponized Microsoft\nExcel attachments. One spam email had a legitimate conversation between\nemployees, which was used as a lure, and forwarded to other employees with a\nweaponized attachment. Other related campaign phishing emails used job or service\noffering.\nIn early-2017, the group was observed again, using a fake Juniper Networks VPN\nportal and few fake University of Oxford websites to deliver malware to the victims. The\ngroup registered four domain names belonging to Oxford University (including oxfordcareers[.]com, oxford[.]in and oxford-employee[.]com).\nIn April 2017, they launched a massive cyber-espionage campaign against major\nIsraeli institutions and government officials. They exploited CVE-2017-0199 remote\ncode execution vulnerability in the Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)\napplication programming interface. They managed to target the victims before\nMicrosoft issued a security update, and organizations rolled out the patch.\nIn May 2017, they expanded their geographical range with hundreds of new attacks\ntargeting several militaries, financial and energy businesses in Europe as well as the\nUnited States. In these attacks, they collaborated with Russian hackers-for-hire.\nIn Sep. 2017, an analysis done by a security firm on Two-face (web shell) disclosed a\ncomplex malicious infrastructure that was targeting Israeli institutions earlier in April.\nThe links between TwoFace and five other web shells were found, including\nRunningBee, PuTTY Link (plink) and RGDoor (for Microsoft IIS).\nIn Oct. 2017, the group developed the \"Agent Injector\" (Trojan with the specific purpose\nof installing the ISMAgent backdoor) to target an organization within the United Arab\nEmirates government. The attack used a spearphishing spam email that had a subject\nof ‘Importan Issue'. The group was also found to be using CVE-2017-11882, an Office\nvulnerability patched by Microsoft on November 14, 2017.\nOn January 8, 2018, the group launched an attack on an insurance agency based in\nthe Middle East. They tried to deliver a new Trojan called OopsIE, via using a variant of\nthe ThreeDollars delivery document. They sent two emails to two separate email\naddresses within the same organization. The email address was linked with the\nLebanese domain of a major global financial institution.\nIn Feb 2018, it was discovered that threat actor dubbed ‘Chafer’ (having an association\nor related to APT34) successfully compromised one of the biggest telecom firms in the\nMiddle East using leaked NSA hacking tools.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn March 2018, the group improved their Critical Infrastructure attacks with new off-theshelf tools, dual-purpose utilities. They were found to be using earlier unseen malware,\nthat uses SmartFile, Google Drive, and internet server API (ISAPI) filters for\ncompromising Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) servers.\nIn July 2018, they launched multiple attacks using spearphishing email (having\nattached PhpSpy and QuadAgent backdoor) to target an unnamed technology services\nprovider, the Lebanese intelligence agency, and healthcare facilities in Saudi Arabia.\nTheir initial infection paths were based on watering hole attacks using compromised\nweb servers. In Sep., they deployed a new variant of their OopsIE Trojan that came\nwith new evasion techniques.\nIn the same month, they also conducted at least one attack campaign containing an\nupdated variant of the BondUpdater Trojan (uses DNS tunneling) as its final payload.\nIn Nov. 2018, new information shed light on the fact that the group tests their malicious\ndocuments before they are being used in their attacks.\nIn April 2019, a group that calls itself Lab Dookhtegan exposed several tools (Poison\nFrog, Glimpse, HyperShell, HighShell, Fox Panel, and Webmask) used by this group.\nIn the same month, a DNSpionage malware campaign was also discovered, using a\nnew malware called 'Karkoff.' The malware was delivered via an Excel document that\nincluded malicious macros. They also created a new remote administration tool that\nsupported HTTP and DNS communication.\nMost recently in June 2019, a Russian cyber-espionage group \"Turla\" was discovered\nto be using attack infrastructure belonging to APT34. The infrastructure was used to\ndeliver a backdoor called \"Neptun,\" installed on Microsoft Exchange servers.\nAlso in June, a phishing campaign was observed asking victims to join their social\nnetwork. This time the group masqueraded as a Cambridge University lecturer, also\nsetting up a LinkedIn page in order to gain victims’ trust. From there they asked victims\nto open malicious documents. In this phishing campaign, three new malware families\nwere detected, named as Pickpocket, ValueVault, and Longwatch.\n\n## Known tools and malware\n\nThis group is known to use multiple custom malware and tools for stealing intellectual\ninformation, lateral movement, and getting an initial foothold into the targeted network.\n\n**Malicious programs used by APT34**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Twoface - A web shell, which is used to harvest credentials**\n**Powruner - A backdoor known to be used by APT34.**\n**RGDoor - An Internet Information Services backdoor which is created using C++.**\n**Helminth - A Trojan that is developed to target the Windows platform.**\n**OopsIE - A Trojan deployed and known to be used by APT34.**\n**Karkoff - A malware designed to execute code remotely on compromised hosts.**\n**ISMAgent - A backdoor which has a sophisticated architecture and contains anti-**\nanalysis techniques.\n**Poison Frog - A backdoor used along with BondUpdater tool.**\n**PhpSpy - A backdoor used for an initial foothold in the targeted network.**\n**Neptun - A backdoor installed on Microsoft Exchange servers as a service.**\n**Pickpocket - It is a browser credential-theft tool.**\n**ValueVault - It is used to extract and view the credentials stored in the Windows Vault.**\n**LongWatch - A Pickpocket variant, and browser credential-theft tool.**\n\n**Custom tools used by APT34**\n\n**Quadagent - A PowerShell backdoor tool, that is attributed to APT34.**\n**ThreeDollars - A delivery document, which is identified as part of the OilRig toolset.**\n**Fox Panel - A hacking tool is known to be linked and used by APT34**\n**HighShell - A web shell-based TwoFace payload used by APT34.**\n**Glimpse - A tool within the data dump, related to the updated BondUpdater tool.**\n**Webmask - A series of scripts specifically meant to perform DNS hijacking.**\n**RunningBee - A web-based TwoFace payload used by APT34.**\n**HyperShell - A TwoFace loader known to used by APT34.**\n\n**Known Zero Days Vulnerabilities**\n\n**Microsoft Office Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199)** **- A**\nremote code-execution vulnerability in Microsoft Office/Wordpad.\n**Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) - A memory-**\ncorruption vulnerability in Microsoft Office.\n\n## Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nThe use of infrastructure linked to Iranian operations, alignment, and timing with the national\ninterests of Iran lead to the conclusion that this group acts or works on behalf of the Iranian\ngovernment. The persistency in the targets of their attack, which are mostly from middle-east\ncountries, also proves the fact that the cyberattacks originated from Iran. Most of their cyber\ncampaigns became active when there was a holiday in Iran, and targeted specific countries\nwith conflict of interest with Iran.\n\n## Prevention\n\nOrganizations and security experts should review the Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and\nuse them with their Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool. Organizations should also\n[consider having threat intel ingestion for their existing investments in the stack of security](https://cyware.com/ctix-stix-taxii-cyber-threat-intelligence-exchange)\ntools like Firewalls, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), etc. with support\nfor automated enrichment from external sources, which would ensure protection from latest\nthreats across the industry. The security experts must understand the fact that fully up-todate antivirus (AV) or reliable antivirus software do not provide 100% protection against\nsophisticated attacks from threats like APT34. For adequate protection, they need a layered\napproach to their endpoint security. Ideally, these layers must combine solutions based on\ndynamic security policy (e.g., behavioral-based Firewalls, Data Loss Prevention systems) as\nwell as the control-based security policy (e.g., whitelisting, application control). Enterprise\nnetworks with endpoint security solutions based on the OS-Centric security approach are\nmore secure against the new types of APT34 attacks. The OS-centric security solutions\nfocus on the final stage of the attack kill chain, and intended damage, so it provides better\nprotection no matter what attack vector or method is used.\n\n##
