While this isn’t the right forum to dive\ndeep into your article, there’s a few things I want to make clear:\n\nWe will not be filing another SEC incident about a breach any time soon\nYou are seeing Black Hat SEO tactics on several hosting accounts, across\ndifferent platforms, including several platforms that were completely unrelated to\nour recent Managed WordPress incident.\n[wsimg.com was not meant to and no longer resolves](http://wsimg.com/)\nCustomers are responsible for the content of their websites. We’re reaching out\nto the customers you mentioned in your post and are alerting them to the\npresence of Black Hat SEO on their websites and are recommending steps to\nclean up their website and protect themselves from further attacks.\n\nThank you again for taking the time to raise this and please reach out if you have any\nother questions. Since this is unrelated to the SSL incident, I would ask that you\ncontact me directly.\n\nThanks,\n\n[redacted]\n\nIf you’ve come here to read a clean description of a deeply technical data supply chain\nproblem, impacting millions of websites across the globe, including dozens if not hundreds of\nU.S. Government domains, and hoping to read all the answers about how it’s happening…\nthen you are going to be disappointed.\n\nThese problems are very complicated, and there are a few things in this research that I still\ndon’t totally understand.\n\n**But I’ll say confidently: something is very, very wrong with GoDaddy infrastructure.**\n**Today. Right now. I’ve attempted to report these problems to several entities/orgs for a good**\nchunk of 2021, nothing has been fixed, and the problems seem to be growing. More and\nmore government websites are being attacked, and no one seems to have figured out “the\nreason”…until now…\n\nCurrently, there are malicious content injections, documented in this research below,\nimpacting organizations like:\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC)\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nThe National Institute of Health (NIH)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\nThe U.S. Government Publishing Office\nThe U.S. Defense Department’s “Defense Technical Information Center” (DOD DTIC)\nThe Minnesota National Guard\nThe U.S. Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical Information\nThe House Education & Labor Committee\nSenator Jon Tester’s Official Senate Website\nThe State of Washington\nThe Maryland State Archives\nThe New Jersey Court System\nThe City of Vallejo, California\nCalifornia’s San Diego Superior Court\nThe Humble, Texas County School District\nThe South Carolina State Library Digital Collections\nThe Crossroads, Texas City Government\nThe Liberty Hill, Texas City Government\nThe District of Columbia’s “Department for-hire Vehicles”\nThe Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife\nThe City of Walpole, Massachusetts\nThe San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission\nThe City of Clifton, Virginia\nThe McCracken County, Kentucky County Schools\nThe City of Auburn, New York\n**_And many more_**\n\nOne fact is clear: on November 22, 2021, GoDaddy reported to the SEC that a wide-ranging\n[security incident had taken place across their Managed WordPress Service [Source Link](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1609711/000160971121000122/gddyblogpostnov222021.htm)\nfrom SEC filing], which GoDaddy “discovered” on November 17, 2021. The report claims that\n“beginning on September 6, 2021, the unauthorized third party used the vulnerability to gain\naccess to the following customer information:”\n\n“Up to 1.2 million active and inactive Managed WordPress customers had their email\naddress and customer number exposed. The exposure of email addresses presents\nrisk of phishing attacks.”\n“The original WordPress Admin password that was set at the time of provisioning was\nexposed. If those credentials were still in use, we reset those passwords.”\n“For active customers, sFTP and database usernames and passwords were exposed.\nWe reset both passwords.”\n“For a subset of active customers, the SSL private key was exposed. We are in the\nprocess of issuing and installing new certificates for those customers.”\n**Read the nightmare details for yourself at SEC.gov in the GoDaddy filings @**\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1609711/000160971121000122/gddyblogpost\nnov222021.htm\n\n\n-----\n\nFor a little reader context – for nearly two years now, I ve been researching and attempting to\nreport niche technical vulnerabilities being exploited by specific types of “Canadian\npharmacy” scammer rings – the groups are focusing attacks on governments, schools,\n[churches, and nonprofits — domains of trust. Vice did a writeup on some of this research](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkb5qy/why-government-and-military-sites-are-hosting-porn-and-viagra-adsovernm)\nback in September 2021, and focused on an exploit in the niche CMS “Laserfiche” which was\nbeing exploited by these “Canadian pharmacy” scammer rings.\n\nSince that research was released, I haven’t stopped the research into these foreign pill\npushers exploiting U.S. government websites but narrowed my focus on an x-files worthy\nblack helicopter – the Loch Ness Monster of malicious redirects. Something out there has\nbeen lurking beneath the surface and creating malicious redirects in uncommonly creative\nways on government websites.\n\nYou can watch this dynamic monster redirection in this video I recently captured where the\nAuburn, New York government website had a malicious redirect and content injection due to\n[an attack via this Godaddy-hosted domain “aqits.com” which was dynamically choosing](http://www.aqits.com/)\nmultiple final “Canadian Pharmacy” scam domains to send the user to:\n\nThis spammer monster seems to have potentially been fed a bunch of GoDaddy websites\ndue to a decision that GoDaddy made in 2017 to inject cross-site JavaScript into all their\nclient domains pages without permission via the domain “wsimg.com.” The malicious actors\npotentially are using some persistent access on wsimg.com to compromise the domains that\nGoDaddy reported to the SEC, and attack other U.S. government websites. This group\nseems to control something on the “wsimg.com” domain – which GoDaddy currently owns\nand has deeply integrated across all of their managed WordPress infrastructure, including\ntheir login pages – and this access is seemingly making it possible for these malicious actors\nto orchestrate their redirects and content injections across a scary number of GoDaddyhosted domains, and then using these hosts to attack more domains.\n\nGoDaddy’s decision and numerous negative comments from developers in 2017 can be\nfound in intimate detail in a fantastic blog post, “GoDaddy hacks WordPress sites, says it’s\n‘Monitoring performance’” – I’d strongly urge reading the whole post (including the comments\nfrom people dealing with it in real time).\n\n\n-----\n\nGoDaddy’s 2017 decision to inject cross-site JavaScript payloads into client domains without\nnotice or permission was described by one developer as, “it broke every single AMP page\n**in my setup” and another person said “I was scanning the sources for checks of**\n**malware as well, and found this injected script. Am actually fine with monitoring**\n**performance… but not with secretive injected coding.” Another potential European user**\nwrote in the comments of that Holy Cow Marketing article in 2019 ”I was poking around my\nnew godaddy hosting and found that this is opt in. That’s on uk.godaddy.com which may be\ndifferent to godaddy.com.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe code injected into all of the GoDaddy WordPress sites includes payloads from the URLs\n“secureserver.net” and also “wsimg.com” as seen in this screenshot from the article:\n\n### Crucial network request captured in live .gov compromise of the Auburn, New York Government website shows Godaddy’s “wsimg.com/tcc” initiates dynamic redirects\n\nWhen clicking on a “live malicious redirect” in Google Search Results which is actively turned\non for a specific government domain, like the Auburn, New York, Government during recent\ntests, malicious content and URL redirections are injected via the Godaddy domain\n\n\n-----\n\nwsimg.com – if you can capture it (countless dynamic malicious rules stop this and prevent\ncapture) – you will see a flow of the network requests like:\n\n1. Google search result click\n2. Requests .gov resource page with a location response header that redirects the user\n3. User redirected to compromised Godaddy domain like\n\n[http://www.aqits.com/auburntaxes.html with initiation requests that indicate this is the](http://www.aqits.com/auburntaxes.html)\npage that fires off the GoDaddy wsimg.com URls with exploits:\n\n4. A “JavaScript file” that has no response body hosted on the GoDaddy infrastructure fires\n[off like “https://img1.wsimg.com/tcc/tcc_l.combined.1.0.6.min.js”](https://img1.wsimg.com/tcc/tcc_l.combined.1.0.6.min.js)\n\n5. A favicon from the original orchestration domain fires off, this one from\n[http://www.aqits.com/favicon.ico](http://www.aqits.com/favicon.ico)\n\n6. A final “Canadian pharmacy” landing page will load, this one with\n[“https://globmedcent.com/search.html?key=viagra&t=p148_mrel&dummy=best” as the URL](https://globmedcent.com/search.html?key=viagra&t=p148_mrel&dummy=best)\n\n7. In the video captured of this live malicious redirect, numerous “final URLs” were found –\nwhich is very common – the dynamic orchestration attacking these domains rotates through\n[hundreds of final scam domains. https://youtu.be/XgCUZIMHqnw](https://youtu.be/XgCUZIMHqnw)\n\nThis wsimg.com domain has 22 subdomains active according to the SecurityTrails report\nhere. Each of these subdomains, if compromised by malicious actors, create unique risks for\nthe entire domain – and the same problems exist for any domains like the “iarugby.com”\ndomain which is mapped via DNS records into this core wsimg.com infrastructure. To read a\nrefresher on CNAME risks, here’s a great primer from Analytics expert Simo Ahava, “What’s\nin a CNAME” (disclaimer: the piece mentions some of my research in this area).\n\n\n-----\n\nMany of the subdomains listed above seem to have potential problems (content + SSL +\nPHP problems), especially based on the “resulting attacks” flowing from GoDaddy hosted\nservers. But none of the subdomains seems as “infected” as the “img2.wsimg.com”\nsubdomain, which according to Google search results, is *literally* only hosting malicious\nPDF content:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt appears as though 100% of the content uploaded to “img2.wsimg.com” contains malicious\nPDFs that promise scam offers, with links in the PDFs that contain malicious redirects to final\nscam domains. Here is an example PDF uploaded into this subdomain:\n\n\n-----\n\n——————————————————————————————————\n### The Godaddy-Hosted Domain Malicious Redirects “Feel Like Magic”\n\nFor folks who doesn’t conduct data supply chain research, or hunt for compromised\ninfrastructure being used by spammers, it may not immediately be clear how odd and\nchallenging the process can sometimes be to figure out how something is occurring –\nspammers can be technical experts who are hunting for specific types of technical\nvulnerabilities, and they always *weaponize a weakness* – open redirects don’t last forever,\nand most of the spammers operate in a “use it or lose it” manner, where they sometimes “go\na little too hard” and upload hundreds or thousands of compromised documents/pages, with\nmalicious redirects, or create a similar number of cached URls from a search bug – these\nefforts are usually found relatively quickly. I’ve previously reported hundreds of subdomains\nthat were compromised on massive companies / banks, which were hosting some of these\nmalicious redirection payloads for a specific spammer group. And many types of malicious\nredirects, are merely “open redirects” – a technical vulnerability which is oftentimes\n\n\n-----\n\nconsidered a low threat (generally correct), but it is also still a profitable technical exploit, so\nignoring these efforts sometimes leads to exploits lasting longer “in the wild” without any\nclear genesis for the compromises.\n\nAs I’ve seen takedowns of malicious redirects on government infrastructure, and personally\nidentified niche CMS and plugin weaknesses and reported them to various organizations for\nremediation, there has remained one “Canadian pharmacy” spammer ring pushing malicious\nredirects that felt like magic. Some of the behaviors that you will experience when auditing\nthe compromised infrastructure includes:\n\n1. When viewing specific Google search results (details below, not sharing malicious\n\n**_links just yet!), you will see PDF files that appear to be hosted on a U.S. government_**\ndomain – the vast majority of these are on the domain suffix “.us” – aka, not on the .gov\ndomain suffix (a few current injections are on .mil … the domain for the U.S. military…\neek!). When you click on these files, one of two things will happen:\n\n1. The pdf files will open as-expected on the unique .us domain (or whatever\n\n“correct” domain there is for that government agency)\n2. The pdf files will redirect through a secondary domain that was hosting a mirrored\n\ncopy of the government PDF, and then redirect the user into a series of 1-2-3\nmalicious redirects before dumping them into a “Canadian pharmacy” scam\nwebsite.\n2. When viewing specific Google search results, if you view the “Google cached version”\n\nof the pages for a file that is hosting one of the malicious redirects described in step #1,\nyou will see a URL clash between the destination URL and the file hosted URL.\n3. If you experience both #1 and #2, if you check who is hosting the website for the “file\n\nhosted URL” described in step #2, for some “kinda odd reason,” you will find it’s always\nhosted by Godaddy in one of their managed hosting providers (WordPress, Drupal,\nHTML templates).\n\nHere is where things get even more odd – the research you see above, I’ve been\ndocumenting this happening since July 2021 – and there seemed to be plenty of proof that\nthis was happening for potentially months (or more) before I first noticed it.\n\nAnother way to say that: the injections / malicious redirects that I was documenting that were\nimpacting government websites, and also inexplicably connected to GoDaddy infrastructure,\nseems to have been occurring before the window that GoDaddy reported to the SEC in\nNovember of this year – and it’s unclear to me whether these are two separate problems, but\nit seems like there is a GoDaddy dumpster fire and many of their domains are finding ways\nto attack government infrastructure in order to create malicious redirects for “Canadian\npharmacy” scammers.\n\nPart of this research involves a domain “wsimg.com” that you’ll find firing JavaScript across\nthe internet due to a GoDaddy test in 2017, which created unprecedented problems due to\nwhat appears to be some type of compromise on that domain.\n\n\n-----\n\nBefore we get into the details, I want to make sure it is clear that GoDaddy is quite possibly\none of the largest and most complex businesses on the internet, due to a few of their\nsubsidiaries and product lines having overlapping ownership and technical resources – along\nwith the complexity from GoDaddy’s “easy website hosting products” that compliments their\ncore domain registration products.\n\nTo provide additional background for this research, one of those (not awesome priced)\n“Domain Reports” was purchased from a service providing a historical WHOIS record,\n**hosting and connected domain history, for the wsimg.com domain – which has been**\nowned by GoDaddy since 2008, although as this research will show, potentially\ncompromised in some way, sometime recently. I also heavily use SecurityTrails.com DNS\nrecords.\n\n**GoDaddy first registered the wsimg.com domain in March 2008 – and it’s registered**\nthrough their reseller arm of Wild West Domains. It’s unclear why the ownership/registration\nis structured this way –it’s odd – but doesn’t necessarily seem nefarious. It is what it is:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe “Connected Domains” report confirms that wsimg.com shares an IP address with both\niacustombags.com and iarugby.com, which could also be seen in this Security Trails list for\n[their actual IP address @ https://securitytrails.com/list/ip/68.178.222.3 – you can also still to](https://securitytrails.com/list/ip/68.178.222.3)\nthis day attempt to navigate directly to wsimg.com and you will be redirected to a “Custom\nCanvas Bag” website owned by an entrepreneur who likely has no idea what could be\nhappening on their infrastructure that is mapped into this crucial GoDaddy domain.\n\n## wsimg.com redirects to iarugby.com – Right Now – Still to this Day\n\n\n-----\n\n**Here are some of the “known” details about this potential global data supply chain**\n**injection and the GoDaddy products that are involved:**\n\n**Only a fraction of GoDaddy’s total domains use their “easy website” products –**\n**so this would not be impacting the full 84 million Godaddy domains. GoDaddy**\nwas founded in 1997 and they have updated public marketing materials for many\nyears, and currently are claiming to have “20+ million customers … with 84+ million\n**[domains.” [Source link from GoDaddy]](https://www.godaddy.com/domains/domain-name-search)**\nGoDaddy formed a wholly-owned subsidiary called “Wild West Domains” in 2002\n\n[[Source Link from Wild West Domains] which continues to provide reseller services for](https://www.wildwestdomains.com/about-us/)\nGoDaddy domains – Wild West-itself owns the wsimg.com domain according to Wild\n[West’s own records (https://rdap.wildwestdomains.com/v1/domain/WSIMG.COM).](https://rdap.wildwestdomains.com/v1/domain/WSIMG.COM)\nSome aspects of this architecture should raise eyebrows for antitrust researchers, but it\nshould also raise interesting questions for security researchers seeing as the\n“wsimg.com” domain, which has long been owned by GoDaddy, was at some-point\nmigrated to Wild West Domains, where it may have not received the same technical\nattention as other core GoDaddy technical products (and thus lead to a compromise on\nthis domain).\n[In November 2021, GoDaddy admitted in SEC filings (TechCrunch coverage) that their](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/godaddy-breach-million-accounts/)\nWordPress hosting environment had been compromised and 1.2 million customers\nwere impacted. Based on other public GoDaddy customer/website client details, this\ncould have impacted up to 5 million WordPress websites (but it appears not total\nnumber of sites, only total customers, has ever been made public).\n\nGoDaddy released details of the attack to the media, and the compromise\nexposed original WordPress admin passwords, SFTP credentials, usernames\nand passwords for WordPress databases, and some SSL private keys.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn September 2017, GoDaddy made the very unfortunate decision to inject JavaScript\npayloads into their Managed WordPress client domains, with a payload that included\n[this URL @ https://img1.wsimg.com/tcc/tcc_l.combined.1.0.6.min.js and a commented](https://img1.wsimg.com/tcc/tcc_l.combined.1.0.6.min.js)\nnote from GoDaddy injected into the websites that said, “// Monitoring performance to\nmake your website faster. If you want to opt-out, please contact web hosting support.”\n\nA great writeup on the 2017 GoDaddy injection can be found at Holy Cow Online\nMarketing @ https://www.holycowonlinemarketing.com/websitedevelopment/godaddy-hacks-wordpress-sites-says-monitoring-performance/ –\nthe 2017 writeup includes details about how they eventually realized the domain\n“wsimg.com” is owned by GoDaddy.\n\n\n-----\n\nToday, if you navigate directly to wsimg.com – the domain that GoDaddy used to host\nJavaScript files they injected into millions of their WordPress client websites in 2017,\nyou will be redirected to a new domain, “iarugby.com” – which is a clone of the content\non “iacustombags.com” – this domain appears to be owned by a Washington State\n[entrepreneur, who also owns https://allseasonpartytents.com/ and several other](https://allseasonpartytents.com/)\ndomains that are built on GoDaddy’s website builder. Attempts to contact the domain\nowner were unsuccessful, and there is no indication that the owner is significantly\ntechnical or aware of any problems associated with their domains. But any malicious\nactor who compromises the current “iarugby.com” domain would likely have deep\ncontrol over the entire wsimg.com domain, which is like using a wet sponge to protect\nFort Knox.\nIt’s extremely odd that this domain “wsimg.com” – when navigating directly to the raw\ndomain – will always seemingly redirect to the Rugby website “iarugby.com”\nhomepage, but minor additions with a directory in the URL, and a WordPress install will\n[be exposed, like this URL @ http://wsimg.com/directory/break-redirect which won’t](http://wsimg.com/directory/break-redirect)\nredirect. If you attempt to connect to this same URL with “https” at the front, an SSL\nconflict is exposed which indicates the SSL on “wsimg.com” is actually from\n“iarugby.com”\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to Facebook s Certificate Tracker\n[(https://developers.facebook.com/tools/ct/search/), this “wsimg.com” domain has](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/ct/search/)\nnumerous subdomains which continues to have active SSLs issued, which are still\nvalid as of writing this research and associated with known-GoDaddy Certificate\nAuthorities:\n\nNotice that the subdomain “blobby.wsimg.com” has an active SSL, which could be\nassociated with a “blob” / Kubernetes instance from GoDaddy.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe wsimg.com domain, along with several subdomains on the iacustombags.com\ndomain (mail.*, whm.*, cpanel.*, webdisk.*) are all mapped to the same IP address\n“68.178.222.3” with all domains hosted by GoDaddy\n[(https://securitytrails.com/list/ip/68.178.222.3).](https://securitytrails.com/list/ip/68.178.222.3)\n\nGoDaddy’s Managed WordPress admins login to their service, which GoDaddy noted\n[was compromised in Fall 2021, via @ https://sso.secureserver.net/ – on this login page,](https://sso.secureserver.net/)\nstill to this day, a total of 11 JavaScript files are embedded into the page and\n**collect/fire data into the “wsimg.com” domain.**\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the JavaScript files which collects data on this GoDaddy Managed WordPress\n[Login page (this JS file @ “https://img1.wsimg.com/auth/v1/static/4128/js/src/trackjs.js”](https://img1.wsimg.com/auth/v1/static/4128/js/src/trackjs.js)\n, includes a comment and code that specifically mentions attempts by GoDaddy\ndevelopers to “remove token and username from URL being logged to track JS” –\nthis section of the code is alarming:\n\n// remove token and username from url being logged to track js\n\npayload.url = payload.url.replace(/token=[^&$]*/, “token=redacted”).replace(/username=\n\n[^&$]*/, “username=redacted”);\n\nCurrently, the wsimg.com domain has a Sender Policy Framework (SPF) that prevents\nemails from being sent through this domain, which seems to have been updated ~7\nmonths ago to this:\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom 2014 until June 2021, the wsimg.com domain’s SPF records included an allowlist\nwith hard coded IP addresses. Many of these IP addresses are actively hosting other\n[domains (Example @ https://securitytrails.com/list/ip/69.64.33.132) which don’t seem](https://securitytrails.com/list/ip/69.64.33.132)\nto be owned by GoDaddy. This SPF architecture seems to have allowed emails to be\nsent as though they were from “wsimg.com” from countless other GoDaddy domains,\neven though this “wsimg.com” domain was an internal logging domain used to inject\nJavaScript across millions of GoDaddy client domains in 2017.\n\nThis architecture seems ripe for abuse, although specific spam campaigns have\nnot been found. The compromise of wsimg.com could potentially have occurred\nfrom this SPF architecture, although there would likely need to be other\nvulnerabilities or phishing campaigns from it. Two of the IP ranges included in the\nSPF records for the domain hosted other websites/content that GoDaddy did not\nseem to control:\n**SPF Records on Wsimg.com until mid 2021 (source @**\n[https://securitytrails.com/domain/wsimg.com/history/txt):](https://securitytrails.com/domain/wsimg.com/history/txt)\nv=spf1 ip4:207.200.21.144/28 ip4:12.151.77.31 ip4:69.64.33.132\nip4:68.233.77.16 ip4:184.168.131.0/24 ip4:173.201.192.0/24 ip4:182.50.132.0/24\nip4:170.146.0.0/16 ip4:174.128.1.0/24 ip4:173.201.193.0/24 include:spf2.domaincontrol.com -all\n\n69.64.33.132 is one of the IP Address ranges permitted to send emails through the\nwsimg.com domain, with other public domains hosted on it\n[(https://securitytrails.com/list/ip/69.64.33.132).](https://securitytrails.com/list/ip/69.64.33.132)\n\n\n-----\n\n[68.233.77.16 also had public domains @ https://securitytrails.com/list/ip/68.233.77.16](https://securitytrails.com/list/ip/68.233.77.16)\n\n\n-----\n\nFor a period of time, until relatively recently a Drupal install changelog was hosted @\n[http://wsimg.com/CHANGELOG.txt which indicated that it hadn’t been updated since](http://wsimg.com/CHANGELOG.txt)\n2018.

But for some of the domains with “clean results” the websites are extremely out of\ndate with other very obvious problems, like this one:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Google cached page on this “instantcreditbuilder.net” domain that was compromised by\nthese “Canadian pharmacy” scammers was captured on just December 17, 2021, and you\n[can see what that looked like here in the Google cache or](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:iCpkp8zPmrQJ:www.instantcreditbuilder.net/disclaimer.html+&cd=41&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) [here in the Way Back Machine.](http://web.archive.org/web/20211231014849/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3AiCpkp8zPmrQJ%3Awww.instantcreditbuilder.net%2Fdisclaimer.html+&cd=41&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us)\n\nHere is a screenshot of that injection in this severely outdated domain hosted on GoDaddy:\n\n\n-----\n\nSo did a domain that still has a Flash banner on the homepage to this day and other\nextremely dated content/language, which was compromised on December 17, 2021 (13 days\nago as of this writing) according to the Google cached search results, suddenly fix this\nproblem and remove the compromised content? Or is something else happening here?)\n\nWhen researching these GoDaddy WordPress domain compromises, I’ve consistently seen\nresults and timing like this, where the facts allude to a website that has not cleaned up their\nown messes, so either GoDaddy is quietly updating client domains and cleaning up\ncompromises (which is always one possible reason), or the spam compromises on these\n**_domains are “unpublishing compromises” and breaking redirects in unique ways?_**\nThere are many indicators that some type of orchestration like this is taking place, but it’s\nquite tough to prove!.. But more details below…\n\n—————————————————————\n\n-----\n\n## Numerous government domains are hosting injected content for “Canadian Pharmacy” scammers documented in Google cached results – attacks active as of December 31, 2021\n\nThere are also higher quality government domains which seem to be “attacked” via GoDaddy\nWordPress Managed websites (and other GoDaddy managed websites) so that the domains\nappear to be hosting “Canadian pharmacy” scam content. And across these higher quality\ngovernment websites attacked by this vulnerability, a common theme is that the malicious\ncontent is almost always “injected” into PDF files/URLs – this is very odd!\n\n\n-----\n\nEach of the results above are for PDF files, which look totally normal when you view them\ndirectly, like via these

cached results pages, you should see “sporadic redirections” where\nsometimes the first click will redirect, and then the next few will break, or the other way\naround like in this example video:\n\nSo what you see here in this video and across this Kentucky public school web domain of\n[“.mccracken.kyschools.us”, is a very unique content injection that by all accounts is](https://www.mccracken.kyschools.us/Downloads/4hexagondragons.pdf)\noriginating from the domain “Mathwire.com” – which as you guessed it, is another GoDaddy\nhosted domain:\n\n\n-----\n\nNow, I want to make sure it’s clear these findings that keep randomly pointing to GoDaddy\nare not false positives – there is no purposeful effort to only highlight domains this is\nhappening to which are also connected to GoDaddy – something is just very wrong with\nGoDaddy right now, and it seems to have been happening for months if not years.\n\nAcross this “mathwire.com” domain, as is the case on all the GoDaddy domains “attacking\nU.S. government resources” you will find significant amounts of “Canadian pharmacy”\nscammer content injected into pages like in this screenshot:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nBut as shown previously, somehow the results for Mathwire.com are being mapped to the\nmccracken.kyschools.us domain via Google cached search results, and showing up within\nGoogle search results in ways to illicit clicks, which can lead to unexpected redirects into\nmalicious content, as shown in the first video on this page.\n\nSpecifically, the Mathwire.com domain seems to be attacking at least one other U.S.\n[government domain @ bce.rcs.k12.tn.us which you can see via these search results – but](http://www.bce.rcs.k12.tn.us/teachers/stemc/web_page/Games/money.pdf)\nthere is only one “mapped file” which currently breaks during tests attempting to navigate\ndirectly to it or via the Google

And who needs to do what to stop this mess?\n\nIt’s important to point out that I first noticed these injections back in July 2021, yet didn’t\nconnect any significant aspect of it to GoDaddy infrastructure. Since I first started noticing\nthese unique injections, and seeing the malicious redirects with my own eyes, and then\nretesting infrastructure only to find it changed or broken, the whole process has felt like\nhunting a ghost in the shell.\n\nThrough a bit of luck during efforts to reverse engineer how the malicious redirects were\nbeing created and what exactly the risks were to end users, I was able to capture one of the\n**malicious redirects which was using a specific Response Header called “X-CF-RAYX”**\n**with a dynamic payload.**\n\nThis “X-CF-RAYX” Response Header is very unique. You probably won’t be familiar with it\neven if you’re a network engineer, but maybe if you’re a malware analyst….That’s not good.\n\nThere is a PHP malware payload that has been found on specific servers, reported back in\nJuly 2021 and written about in this fantastically helpful post, “Malicious PHP I found on a\ncolleague’s website 🦠”\n\n\n-----\n\nI d strongly recommend reading the entire blog post about this PHP malware, the author\nincluded an entire payload that I’ll also highlight here – but this author also highlighted\nsomething unique and important – these payloads were found associated with .ru – Russian\ndomain suffixes, and I see no connection to GoDaddy with these early domains. It appears\nthat early tests were associated with Russia prior to moving into this other phase of what\ncould be the same PHP malware (Reminder: WordPress is written in PHP, which would be at\nthe heart of GoDaddy’s Managed WordPress infrastructure).\n\nThe author of the post who originally found this PHP malware also included a secondary\npayload that was found on another compromised site – the heavy obfuscation of this actor\nbecomes even more clear:\n\n\n-----\n\nHere is the malicious payload which references the Response Header that I saw during my\ntests:\n\n\n-----\n\nfunction get_proxy_page($phead=1){\n\n$proto=stripos(@$_SERVER[‘SERVER_PROTOCOL’],’https’) === true ? ‘https://’ :\n‘http://’;\n\n$crurl=$proto.@$_SERVER[‘HTTP_HOST’].@$_SERVER[‘REQUEST_URI’];\n\nlist($buf,$curly_page_get_info)=curly_page_get($crurl);\n\n$ct=@$curly_page_get_info[‘content_type’];\n\n$nexturl=@$curly_page_get_info[‘redirect_url’];\n\n$status=@$curly_page_get_info[‘http_code’];\n\nif (status!=””)header(“Status: $status”);\n\nif ($phead)header(“X-CF-RAYX: “.substr(md5(time()),0,10));\n\nBased on my attempts to understand aspects of this infrastructure, this Response Header\nseems to be one of the “most visible / consistent” ways to see the malicious redirects – at\nleast that’s my current opinion based on what I know.\n\n———————————————\n\nMore alarming, if you compare the PHP code from this July 2021 blog post, it aligns to\nsimilar PHP malware from 3 years ago, which someone within the comments section flagged\n– and that compromise specifically involved Godaddy hosting, which was written up in this\n[post, “GoDaddy shared Windows hosting compromised.”](https://boyet.com/blog/godaddy-shared-windows-hosting-compromised)\n\n\n-----\n\nBut do you know what is *most alarming* about this blog post from 3 years ago focused on\nPHP malicious orchestration injections on GoDaddy hosted servers? There are people in\n**_the comments as recently as last month who found the blog post due to compromised_**\n**_PHP files being found on their GoDaddy servers. There are numerous victims cleaning_**\nup servers still this year, with no clarity about how it’s happening:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nSome users in the comments section of that post from 3 years ago noted that their\n“web.config” files were compromised, which seems to be a pretty solid way to conduct\norchestration attacks against page templates. If you aren’t familiar with this concept,\nMicrosoft Developer Support has a “helpful” article called “Injecting content to every page on\na site” explaining how to inject global scripts into templates within a PHP application.\n\nThere is another code sample that someone uploaded to unPHP which has nearly the same\npayload highlighted in the blog post from July 2021, but in one large code chunk which\nmakes it slightly easier to see the sections focused on Googlebot as well as this section that\nreferences the header “X-CF-RAYX” :\n\n\n-----\n\nThis code here makes it clear that when the malicious PHP file on a compromised server\nidentifies Googlebot or other crawling services, it pushes unique payloads for this session,\nwhich seems to be how the injections are showing up in Google search results and resulting\nin illicit traffic to their scam pharmacy domains:\n\n\n-----\n\n———\nThere is one potential, successful capture of a malicious payload being pushed through the\nGoDaddy domain “wsimg.com” here on Joe’s Sandbox @\n[https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/228738/0/html – certain elements of this report should](https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/228738/0/html)\nbe reviewed by anyone interested in attempting to reverse engineer how Googlebot is\nimpacted.\n\n————–\n\n\n-----\n\n[The http://tencent.wsimg.com subdomain within GoDaddy s potentially compromised](http://tencent.wsimg.com/)\ninfrastructure has been identified in Google’s Virustotal malware directory associated with\nrecent malware campaigns @\nhttps://virustotal.com/graph/embed/gb75b8bf74cd54cc3a7c564a13e3ac4960ad4b9b53f8b4d\nc6a9f0c2661a22f1d0\n\n————–\n\nThe Tria.ge service flagged problems with certain requests that included the wsimg.com\n[domain here @ https://tria.ge/210511-7j62grpgw2/behavioral2](https://tria.ge/210511-7j62grpgw2/behavioral2)\n\n————–\n\n## Who should do what about this problem?\n\n**Google’s Google Bot is broken – and it’s been broken for a while, just like I told them it**\nwas. Google needs to stop thinking that there are zero ways for a domain to trick Googlebot\ninto caching the wrong content for the domain, because it’s clear that GoDaddy domains are\ndoing just that and attacking U.S. Government domains with this tactic.\n\n**GoDaddy’s wsimg.com domain is a shit show and needs a total implosion of all**\n**services and infrastructure touching it – something remains deeply broken on this**\ndomain, it appears to be partially controlled by malicious actors who can use it to launch and\n“un-launch” attacks on specific GoDaddy clients, who then can be used to conduct attacks\nagainst the Googlebot to “inject malicious content” into what appears to be U.S. government\ndomains (along with other schools, nonprofits and organizations *not* included in this\nresearch because there are just too many attacks flowing from GoDaddy servers right now).\n\n**CISA & the U.S. government – Please for the love of God stop hosting websites with**\nGoDaddy’s Managed Hosting Provider, at a bare minimum until these problems are clarified.\nFurthermore, a very close audit of all compromised servers in this research needs to be\nundertaken, looking specifically for malicious PHP files on any servers, but also looking for\nany specific CMS weaknesses that were exploited via these GoDaddy hosted websites.\nSome of the domains which have active injections seemed to have relationships with the\ndomains who were injecting content via Googlebot, and some aspects of this seemed\nunique.\n\n**Everyone using GoDaddy Managed Hosting Providers (WordPress, Drupal, any of**\n**them) – You should consider your server potentially compromised, and check for unexpected**\nPHP files with unique names being hosted on your servers. There seems to be a ton of\ndynamic orchestration involved, and this appears to also include the naming of the\ncompromised PHP files. I would also strongly urge changing passwords, which GoDaddy\nalso recommended in their SEC report *(and seems to have forced all their clients to do).\n\n///\n\n\n-----\n\nQuestions? Concerns?
