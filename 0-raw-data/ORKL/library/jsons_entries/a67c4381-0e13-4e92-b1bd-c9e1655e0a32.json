[AT&T Cybersecurity](https://cybersecurity.att.com/)\n2. [Blog](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs)\n\nSeptember 6, 2022 | [Ofer Caspi](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/author/ofer-caspi)\n\n## Executive summary\n\nAT&T Alien Labs has discovered a new malware targeting endpoints and IoT devices that are running Linux\noperating systems. Shikitega is delivered in a multistage infection chain where each module responds to a\npart of the payload and downloads and executes the next one. An attacker can gain full control of the\nsystem, in addition to the cryptocurrency miner that will be executed and set to persist.\n\n## Key takeaways:\n\nThe malware downloads and executes the Metasploit’s “Mettle” meterpreter to maximize its control on\ninfected machines.\nShikitega exploits system vulnerabilities to gain high privileges, persist and execute crypto miner.\nThe malware uses a polymorphic encoder to make it more difficult to detect by anti-virus engines.\nShikitega abuse legitimate cloud services to store some of its command and control servers (C&C).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Shikitega operation process.\n\n## Background\n\n[With a rise of nearly 650% in malware and ransomware for Linux this year, reaching an all-time high in the](https://atlasvpn.com/blog/linux-malware-on-a-rise-reaching-all-time-high-in-h1-2022)\nfirst half year of 2022, threat actors find servers, endpoints and IoT devices based on Linux operating\nsystems more and more valuable and find new ways to deliver their malicious payloads. New malwares like\n[BotenaGo and](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/att-alien-labs-finds-new-golang-malwarebotenago-targeting-millions-of-routers-and-iot-devices-with-more-than-30-exploits) [EnemyBot are examples of how malware writers rapidly incorporate recently discovered](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/rapidly-evolving-iot-malware-enemybot-now-targeting-content-management-system-servers)\nvulnerabilities to find new victims and increase their reach.\n\nShikitega uses an infection chain in multiple layers, where the first one contains only a few hundred bytes,\nand each module is responsible for a specific task, from downloading and executing Metasploit meterpreter,\nexploiting Linux vulnerabilities, setting persistence in the infected machine to downloading and executing a\ncryptominer.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe main dropper of the malware is a very small ELF file, where its total size is around only 370 bytes, while\nits actual code size is around 300 bytes. (figure 2)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Malicious ELF file with a total of only 376 bytes.\n\n[The malware uses the “Shikata Ga Nai” polymorphic XOR additive feedback encoder, which is one of the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikata_ga_nai)\nmost popular encoders used in Metasploit. Using the encoder, the malware runs through several decode\nloops, where one loop decodes the next layer, until the final shellcode payload is decoded and executed.\nThe encoder stud is generated based on dynamic instruction substitution and dynamic block ordering. In\naddition, registers are selected dynamically. Below we can see how the encoder decrypts the first two\nloops: (figures 3 and 4)\n\nFigure 3. First “Shikata Ga Nai” decryption loop.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Second “Shikata Ga Nai” decryption loop created by the first one.\n\nAfter several decryption loops, the final payload shellcode will be decrypted and executed. As the malware\ndoes not use any imports, it uses ‘int 0x80’ to execute the appropriate syscall. As the main dropper code is\nvery small, the malware will download and execute additional commands from its command and control by\ncalling 102 syscall (sys_socketcall). (Figure 5)\n\nFigure 5. Calling system functions using interrupts\n\nThe C&C will respond with additional shell commands to execute, as seen in the packet capture in figure 6.\nThe first bytes marked in blue are the shell commands that the malware will execute.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Additional commands received from C&C.\n\nThe received command will download additional files from the server that won’t be stored in the hard drive,\nbut rather will be executed from memory only. (Figure 7)\n\nFigure 7. Executes additional shell code received from C&C.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn other malware versions, it will use the execve syscall to execute /bin/sh with command received from\nthe C&C. (figure 8)\n\nFigure 8. Executing shell commands by using syscall_execve.\n\n[The malware downloads and executes ‘Mettle’, a Metasploit meterpreter that allows the attacker to use a](https://github.com/rapid7/mettle)\nwide range of attacks from webcam control, sniffer, multiple reverse shells (tcp/http..), process control,\nexecute shell commands and more.\n\nIn addition the malware will use wget to download and execute the next stage dropper.\n\n## Next stage dropper\n\nThe next downloaded and executed file is an additional small ELF file (around 1kb) encoded with the\n“Shikata Ga Nai” encoder. The malware decrypts a shell command that will be executed by calling\nsyscall_execve with ‘/bin/sh” as a parameter with the decrypted shell. (Figure 9)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Second stage dropper decrypts and executes shell commands.\n\nThe executed shell command will download and execute additional files. To execute the next and last stage\n[dropper, it will exploit two linux vulnerabilities to leverage privileges - CVE-2021-4034 and](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-4034) [CVE-2021-3493](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3493)\n(figure 10 and 11).\n\nFigure 10. Exploiting Linux vulnerability CVE-2021-3493.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Exploiting CVE-2021-4034 vulnerability.\n\nThe malware will leverage the exploit to download and execute the final stage with root privileges persistence and cryptominer payload.\n\n## Persistence\n\nTo achieve persistence, the malware will download and execute a total of 5 shell scripts. It persists in the\nsystem by setting 4 crontabs, two for the current logged in user and the other two for the user root. It will first\ncheck if the crontab command exists on the machine, and if not, the malware will install it and start the\ncrontab service.\n\n[To make sure only one instance is running, it will use the flock command with a lock file “/var/tmp/vm.lock”.](https://linux.die.net/man/2/flock)\n\nFigure 12. Adding root crontab to execute the final payload.\n\nBelow is the list of downloaded and executed script to achieve persistence:\n\n\nscript\nname\n\n\ndetails\n\n\nunix.sh Check if “crontab” commands exist in the system, if not install it and start the crontab\nservice.\n\nbrict.sh Adds crontab for current user to execute cryptominer.\n\npolitrict.sh Adds root crontab to execute cryptominer.\n\ntruct.sh Adds crontab for current user to download cryptominer and config from C&C.\n\n\n-----\n\nscript\nname\n\n\ndetails\n\n\nrestrict.sh Adds root crontab to download cryptominer and config from C&C.\n\nAs the malware persists with crontabs, it will delete all downloaded files from the system to hide its\npresence.\n\n## Cryptominer payload\n\nThe malware downloads and executes XMRig miner, a popular miner for the Monero cryptocurrency. It will\nalso set a crontab to download and execute the crypto miner and config from the C&C as mentioned in the\npersistence part above.\n\nFigure 13. XMRig miner is downloaded and executed on an infected machine.\n\n## Command and control\n\n[Shikitega uses cloud solutions to host some of its command and control servers (C&C) as shown by OTX in](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/hostname/dash.cloudflare.ovh)\nfigure 14. As the malware in some cases contacts the command and control server using directly the IP\nwithout domain name, it’s difficult to provide a complete list of indicators for detections since they are volatile\nand they will be used for legitimate purposes in a short period of time.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. Command and control server hosted on a legitimate cloud hosting service.\n\n## Recommended actions\n\n1. Keep software up to date with security updates.\n2. Install Antivirus and/or EDR in all endpoints.\n3. Use a backup system to backup server files.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThreat actors continue to search for ways to deliver malware in new ways to stay under the radar and avoid\ndetection. Shiketega malware is delivered in a sophisticated way, it uses a polymorphic encoder, and it\ngradually delivers its payload where each step reveals only part of the total payload. In addition, the\nmalware abuses known hosting services to host its command and control servers.
