Victims of interest are then infected with additional malware\nincluding Gh0st RAT to steal credentials for cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, enabling the\nLazarus Group to conduct lucrative operations stealing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. We\nalso discovered what appears to be the first publicly documented instance of a nation-state\ntargeting a point-of-sale related framework for the theft of credit card data in a related set of\nattacks. Moreover, the timing of the point-of-sale related attacks near the holiday shopping\nseason makes the potential financial losses considerable.\n\nWith activity dating at least to 2009, the Lazarus Group has consistently ranked among the most\n[disruptive, successful, and far-reaching nation-state sponsored actors. The March 20, 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_South_Korea_cyberattack)\n[attack in South Korea, the Sony Pictures hack in 2014, the successful theft of $81 million from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack)\n[the Bangladesh Bank in 2014 and perhaps most famously this year’s WannaCry ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack)\n\n\n-----\n\naccepted as being a North Korean state-sponsored threat actor by numerous organizations in the\n[information](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/McAfee-Labs-10-Days-of-Rain-July-2011.pdf) [security industry, law enforcement agencies, and intelligence](https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2017_chasing-lazarus-a-hunt-for-the-infamous-hackers-to-prevent-large-bank-robberies) [agencies around the](https://www.scmagazineuk.com/pyongyang-calling-gchq-also-now-pins-wannacry-on-north-korea/article/669070/)\nworld.\n\nThe group has increasingly focused on financially motivated attacks and appears to be\ncapitalizing on both the increasing interest and skyrocketing prices for cryptocurrencies. The\nLazarus Group’s arsenal of tools, implants, and exploits is extensive and under constant\n[development. Previously, they have employed DDoS botnets, wiper malware to temporarily](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-164A)\n[incapacitate a company, and a sophisticated set of malware targeting the SWIFT banking system](https://securelist.com/files/2017/04/Lazarus_Under_The_Hood_PDF_final.pdf)\nto steal millions of dollars.\n\n[In this research we detail a new implant dubbed PowerRatankba, a PowerShell-based malware](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/pfpt-us-wp-north-korea-bitten-by-bitcoin-bug.pdf)\nvariant that closely resembles the original Ratankba implant. We believe that PowerRatankba\nwas likely developed as a replacement in Lazarus Group’s strictly financially motivated team’s\narsenal to fill the hole left by Ratankba’s discovery and very public documentation earlier this\nyear.\n\nWe also provide a brief timeline of events related to the malicious activity and describe the\nvarious delivery methods that Lazarus Group utilized to infect victims with PowerRatankba (Fig.\n1). We then detail the inner workings of PowerRatankba and how it is utilized to deliver a more\nfully capable backdoor to interesting victims (Fig. 1). Following that, we share details on a new\nand emerging threat targeting the point-of-sale industry that we have dubbed RatankbaPOS (Fig.\n1). Finally, we explain our high-confidence attribution to Lazarus Group.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile this report has introduced several new additions to Lazarus Group’s ever-growing arsenal,\nincluding a variety of different attack vectors, a new PowerShell implant and Gh0st RAT variant,\nas well as an emerging point-of-sale threat targeting South Korean devices, there are two key\ntakeaways from this research:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing a financially motivated arm of a state actor highlights an often overlooked or\nunderestimated aspect of state-sponsored attacks; in this case, we were able to differentiate\nthe actions of the financially motivated team within Lazarus from those of their espionage\nand disruption teams that have recently grabbed headlines.\n\nThis group is now appears to be targeting individuals rather than just organizations:;\nindividuals are softer targets, often lacking resources and knowledge to defend themselves\nand providing new avenues of monetization for a state-sponsored threat actor’s toolkit.\n\n\nMoreover, both the explosive growth in cryptocurrency values and the emergence of new pointof-sale malware near the peak holiday shopping season provide an interesting example of how\none state-sponsored actor is following the money, adding direct theft from individuals and\norganizations to the more “traditional” approach of targeting financial institutions for espionage\nthat we often observe with other APT actors.\n\n**[To read more, download the full report.](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/pfpt-us-wp-north-korea-bitten-by-bitcoin-bug.pdf)**\n\n###### Most recent\n\n 5 DAYS AGO\n\n[Zeus Panda Banking Trojan Targets Online Holiday Shoppers](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/zeus-panda-banking-trojan-targets-online-holiday-shoppers)\n\n###### 2 WEEKS AGO\n\n[Cybersecurity Predictions for 2018](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/cybersecurity-predictions-2018)\n\n###### 2 WEEKS AGO\n\nDialing for dollars - Coinminers appearing as malware components, standalone threats across\nthe web\n\n###### 1 MONTH AGO\n\n[Credential phishing and an Android banking Trojan combine in Austrian mobile attacks](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/credential-phishing-and-android-banking-trojan-combine-austrian-mobile-attacks)\n\n###### 1 MONTH AGO\n\n[Threat Actor Profile: KovCoreG, The Kovter Saga](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actor-profile-kovcoreg-kovter-saga)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Ransomware Survival Guide ](https://www.proofpoint.com/us)\n\n\n[Threat Reference ](https://www.proofpoint.com/us)\n\n[Proofpoint Blog ](https://www.proofpoint.com/us)\n\n[Threat Insight Blog ](https://www.proofpoint.com/us)\n\n[Events ](https://www.proofpoint.com/us)\n\n[Media Contacts ](https://www.proofpoint.com/us)\n\n\n### Company Information\n\n [About Proofpoint](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/company/about)\n\n [Board of Directors](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/board-of-directors)\n\n [Careers](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/company/careers)\n\n [Corporate Blog](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog)\n\n [Investors Center](http://investors.proofpoint.com/)\n\n [Leadership Team](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/our-leadership-team)\n\n [News Center](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/news)\n\n### Quick links\n\n [Daily Ruleset Summary](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/daily-ruleset-update-summary)\n\n [IP Address Blocked?](https://ipcheck.proofpoint.com/)\n\n [Threat Insight (blog)](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight)\n\n [Upgrade from McAfee](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/solutions/intel-mcafee-transition)\n\n### Connect\n\n#####  See all contacts\n\n####     \n\n### Regions\n\n\n-----",
