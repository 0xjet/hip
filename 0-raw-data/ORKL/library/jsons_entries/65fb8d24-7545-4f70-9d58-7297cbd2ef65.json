Jaxx Liberty, the latest version of the wallet, supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more\nthan a dozen other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n-----\n\nFlashpoint analysts earlier this month notified Jaxx support teams as well as the Cloudflare\ncontent delivery network. Cloudflare took steps to suspend services to the spoofed site,\nwhich was a line-by-line copy of the actual Jaxx site that included modifications made to the\ndownload links, redirecting those to an attacker-controlled server.\n\nIt should be noted that this is primarily a social engineering attack and does not involve a\nvulnerability in the Jaxx application, website, or other domains owned by Decentral, a\nCanadian blockchain startup, that provides Jaxx.\n\nIt’s unclear how the attackers were luring victims to the spoofed Jaxx site, whether they were\nrelying on poisoned search engine results, phishing via email or chat applications, or other\nmeans to infect victims.\n\n## Focus on Windows, Mac Desktop Users\n\nThe start date for this campaign figures to be Aug. 19 when the fraudulent domain was\ncreated. The attackers were targeting Windows and Mac OS X users with a variety of\nmalware developed for the desktop platforms. Anyone who clicked on the mobile downloads\nwere redirected to the legitimate Jaxx website.\n\nVisitors to the fraudulent website, below, would likely believe they were on the legitimate\nJaxx page since the attackers went to the trouble of installing the legitimate wallet software\nonto victims’ computers while malware silently installed in the background.\n\nImage 1: The fraudulent Jaxx website.Image 1: The fraudulent Jaxx website.\nVisitors clicking on the fraudulent links for the Mac OS X software were presented with a\ncustom-built malicious Java Archive (JAR) file. The fraudulent Windows software link\ndownloaded a custom-written .NET application, which contained not only malicious behavior\n(such as exfiltrating all of the victim’s desktop files to a command-and-control [C2] server),\nbut also downloaded, KPOT Stealer and Clipper, both of which are marketed on\nunderground Russian-language cybercrime sites.\n\nThe Mac OS JAR file is programmed in PHP and compiled using a Russian language IDE\ncalled DevelNext. The Jaxx branding throughout the code indicates the malware was\ndeveloped solely for this campaign.\n\nVictims executing the JAR see a message in Russian and English: “Temporarily due to\ntechnical problems on the server, you cannot create a new wallet.” Victims are then routed to\nthe “PAIR / RESTORE WALLET” screen which prompts them for their Jaxx wallet backup\nphrase — a password used to decrypt wallets in order for the attackers to exfiltrate the digital\ncurrency from the victim’s account. The backup phrase is then exfiltrated to the attacker’s\nweb server while the victim receives another mixed Russian and English-language error\nmessage that states, “Server is not available. Try again in 4 hours,” below.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 2: Malicious JAR file containing error messages in English and Russian.Image 2:\n_Malicious JAR file containing error messages in English and Russian._\nVictims on Windows who execute the malicious link download a Zip archive called\nLibertyBeta-setup-2.0.9.zip from a Google Docs URL. Like the Mac OS X JAR, the malicious\n.NET binary was likely created specifically for this campaign. The malware reaches out to the\ncommand-and-control server where all of the local .txt, .doc, and .xls files are uploaded. The\nphony application then downloads three executables from hardcoded URLs: the official\nLiberty Beta installer, and KPOT, which steals information from the local hard drive, as well\nas Clipper, which monitors the clipboard for digital wallet addresses; once an address is\nfound, it is swapped out for a wallet address controlled by the attacker. By changing these\naddresses in the clipboard, victims may not notice the modified recipient after copying and\npasting these long alphanumeric addresses while sending payments.\n\n## Assessment\n\nThis malware campaign indicates that cybercriminals may go to great lengths to socially\nengineer an organization’s customers into installing malware to ultimately steal digital\ncurrency. It’s likely cybercriminals will continue to leverage commodity malware kits offered\nfor sale in underground hacking forums to steal credentials and/or digital currency from\nvictims.\n\n[To download the IOCs for this Jaxx campaign, click here for CSV and](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/malware-campaign-targets-jaxx-cryptocurrency-wallet-users/attachment/jaxx-csv/) click here for MISP\nJSON.\n\navatar\n\n## Paul Burbage\n\n_Senior Malware Researcher_\n\nPaul is a Senior Malware Researcher at Flashpoint with over 15 years of experience in the\nthreat intelligence and information security arena.
