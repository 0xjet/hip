The attackers appeared to be undeterred by exposure and\nSymantec, a division of Broadcom Software, has found a large number of new indicators of\ncompromise (IOCs) relating to this latest wave of attacks.\n\nSymantec’s Threat Hunter Team first became aware of this recent campaign when\nsuspicious activity was spotted in a customer environment on September 30, 2021. This\ninitial suspicious activity was detected by our Cloud Analytics technology, and further\ninvestigation found that attempts were being made to download a suspicious file named\nmpr.dll onto the customer’s environment. Msiexec.exe was attempting to download the file\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom a suspicious URL. Further analysis indicated that five files were downloaded, four of\nwhich were signed and appeared to be legitimate DLL files, but the file named mpr.dll was\nnot signed and was suspiciously large for a single DLL file at 588 MB. Symantec researchers\nconcluded that this was a “Latin American banking Trojan”, due to the similar characteristics\nand file names seen in this campaign and in the research into Latin American banking\nTrojans published by ESET in 2020.\n\nFurther investigation by our analysts revealed similar activity had been aimed at multiple\ndifferent organizations since late August 2021. In fact, as many as 98 organizations may\nhave been targeted with similar activity, with all affected organizations based in Brazil.\n\nThe sectors targeted with this activity included information technology, professional services,\nmanufacturing, financial services, and government.\n\n## What is a “Latin American banking Trojan”?\n\nBanking Trojans are a type of malware designed to steal victims’ online banking information\nso malicious actors can access victims’ bank accounts. Once on a machine, the malware\ntypically works by monitoring the websites victims are visiting and comparing these to a\nhardcoded list. If the victim visits a banking website the Trojan will generally display a\nspoofed login page in a pop-up over the legitimate page in an attempt to harvest victims’\nbanking credentials. These pop-ups are generally made to imitate the specific banks’\nlegitimate login pages and are often quite convincing.\n\nWhile once one of the biggest threats on the cyber-crime landscape, banking Trojans have\nbeen usurped in many parts of the world by ransomware in recent times. However, in Latin\nAmerica particularly they still dominate a lot of cyber-crime activity.\n\nIn its 2020 report, ESET determined that there were 11 banking Trojan gangs operating in\nLatin America, and that these groups cooperated with each other. It came to this conclusion\ndue to the many shared tactics, tools, and procedures used by the cyber criminals deploying\nbanking Trojans in Latin America.\n\n## Attack chain for recent activity\n\nWe did not observe what the initial infection vector was in this campaign, but it was likely a\nmalicious URL spread via either spam email campaigns or through malvertising, which is\ntypically the first step in Latin American banking Trojan campaigns. Victims are then directed\nto one of the following malicious URLs:\n\nhxxps://centreldaconsulta[.]com/\nhxxps://www.centralcfconsulta[.]net/\nhxxps://centralcfconsulta[.]net/index3.php?api=vFUMIfUzGz2QdjxTFKAMyTlh\nhxxps://centralcfconsulta.net/\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxps://www.centralcfconsulta[.]net/index3.php?api=r0ubnHRxDycEy5uFPViNA55Y3t\nhxxps://www.centralcfconsulta[.]net/index3.php?\napi=4DQSbdp3hLqPRGTbOGtl7jCD9FKNViKXmKd9Lv\nhxxps://centreldaconsulta[.]com/index3.php?api=nJsdr1J3h0fsG18sRAVQt6JjVW\nhxxps://centreldaconsulta[.]com/index3.php?api=ThMyMCAQEOLIC9nO\nhxxps://www.centralcfconsulta[.]net/index3.php?\napi=wen1eIFCeUh0jAS3mWIDUhSLt3sXMQ\n\nVictims are then redirected to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) URL, which it appears the\nattackers abused to use as a command-and-control (C&C) server. A ZIP file that contains a\nMicrosoft Software Installer (MSI) file is downloaded from the AWS infrastructure.\n\nESET reported that most gangs deploying banking Trojans in Latin America had started\nusing MSI files as an initial download in 2019. An MSI file can be used to install, uninstall,\nand update applications running on Windows systems.\n\nIf the victim double-clicks the MSI file inside the downloaded ZIP, it will execute msiexec.exe,\nwhich then connects to a secondary C&C server to download another ZIP file containing the\npayload (mpr.dll), along with other legitimate portable executable (PE) files. The URLs\nobserved being accessed by msiexec.exe included:\n\nhxxp://13.36.240[.]208/ando998.002\nhxxp://13.36.240[.]208/msftq.doge\nhxxp://15.237.60[.]133/esperanca.lig2\nhxxp://15.237.60[.]133/esperanca.liga\nhxxp://52.47.163[.]237/microsft.crts\nhxxp://52.47.163[.]237/nanananao.uooo\nhxxp://15.237.27[.]77/carindodone.ways\n\nThe extracted ZIP file contains a renamed legitimate Oracle application - VBoxTray.exe. This\nis executed to load the payload (mpr.dll) by way of DLL search-order hijacking. DLL searchorder hijacking takes advantage of how Windows handles DLLs to allow an attacker to load\nmalicious code into a legitimate process. The mpr.dll file is also bigger than 100 MB in order\nto evade submission to security services, which tend not to process files above that size.\nBoth of these files and this exact same process were observed in the banking Trojan activity\ndetailed in ESET’s report.\n\nPersistence is then created for the renamed VBoxTray.exe so that mpr.dll is always sideloaded into it by way of either Windows Registry or Windows Management Instrumentation\n(WMI). This is another common technique used in the attack chain for Latin American\nbanking Trojans.\n\n## Stay alert for this activity\n\n\n-----\n\nThe various steps taken by the attackers behind this activity to evade detection - such as\nusing a large file for the payload so that it won’t be scanned by security software, and\nleveraging legitimate processes and applications for malicious purposes - show that those\nbehind this attack campaign are reasonably sophisticated actors. The number of\norganizations affected in this campaign also indicates that a large number of people are\nlikely responsible for this activity - and it may be that more than one group is behind this\nactivity. It could be a number of groups acting in a cooperative manner, as ESET said may\nbe the approach taken by the various banking Trojan attack groups operating in Latin\nAmerica.\n\nWhile ransomware dominates much of the discussion on the cyber-crime landscape at the\nmoment, it is important to remember it is not the only threat out there. Banking Trojans have\nthe potential to be a costly problem for individuals and organizations, so people, especially\nthose based in Latin America where this activity appears to be particularly prevalent, need to\nremain alert to this threat.\n\nSimple steps, like ensuring you have multi-factor authentication enabled on all financial\naccounts, can help lessen the impact of threats like these.\n\n## Protection\n\n**File-based:**\n\nInfostealer.Bancos\n\n[For the latest protection updates, please visit the Symantec Protection Bulletin.](https://www.broadcom.com/support/security-center/protection-bulletin)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n About the Author\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n**Symantec**\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to\ninvestigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer\nanalysis that helps customers respond to attacks\n\n\n-----",
