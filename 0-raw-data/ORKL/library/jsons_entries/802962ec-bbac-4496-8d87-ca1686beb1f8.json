The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) gives the victims of cybercrime a convenient and easy-to-use reporting mechanism that alerts authorities to suspected criminal or civil violations. For law enforcement and regulatory agencies at the federal, state, local, tribal and international levels, IC3 provides a central referral mechanism for complaints involving Internet-related crimes.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2012 Internet Crime Report\n\n# 1  \n\n###### Executive Summary\n\nNow in its 13th year of operation, the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3®) has firmly established its role as a valuable\nresource for both victims of Internet crime and the law enforcement agencies investigating and prosecuting these crimes. For\nthe victims, the IC3 provides a convenient and easy-to-use reporting mechanism that alerts authorities to suspected criminal\nviolations. For law enforcement agencies, the IC3 serves as a conduit to receive Internet-related complaints, to conduct research\nrelated to them and to develop analytical reports based on them for state, local, federal, tribal or international law enforcement\nand/or regulatory agencies. These agencies then develop investigations based on the forwarded information, as appropriate.\n\nIn 2012, the IC3 received 289,874 consumer complaints with an adjusted dollar loss of $525,441,110[1], which is an 8.3-percent\nincrease in reported losses since 2011. In recognition of this increase, the IC3 expanded its efforts to inform the general public\nabout online scams by publishing several public service announcements and providing additional tips for Internet consumers.\n\nThe IC3’s success has attracted international interest. Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany use the IC3 as a model for\nsimilar cybercrime centers. In furtherance of its continuing support of foreign law enforcement, the IC3 prepared dozens of\ncountry-specific statistical reports and disseminated hundreds of complaint referrals to FBI Legat offices throughout the world.\nIn 2013, the IC3 will continue to pursue its mission to serve both the online public and law enforcement and regulatory agencies\nthroughout the entire global community.\n\n###### Complaint Totals By Year\n\n1Method of evaluating loss amounts: The FBI IC3 staff reviewed for validity all complaints that reported a loss of more than $100,000. Analysts also converted losses reported\nin foreign currencies to dollars. The final amounts of all reported losses above $100,000 for which the complaint information did not support the loss amount were excluded\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Step-By-Step Guide to IC3\n\n History of IC3\n\nThe Internet Fraud Complaint Center — a partnership between\nthe FBI and NW3C (funded by BJA) — was established May\n8, 2000, to address the ever-increasing incidence of online\nfraud. Just three years later, in response to the exponential\nincrease in cybercrime of all types, the Center changed its\nname to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).\n\n\nThe IC3 offers remote access\ncapability, making data available to\nlaw enforcement anywhere. This Webbased access provides users the ability\nto aggregate victims and losses to\nsubstantiate criminal activity within\nthe agency’s area of jurisdiction and\nto enhance the development of cases.\n\n\nThe IC3 analysts use automated matching systems to identify\nlinks and commonalities between numerous complaints and\ncombine the respective complaints into referral groups for\nlaw enforcement. Of the 289,874 complaints received in\n2012, 39.64 percent (114,908) reported financial loss.\n\n\nToday, the IC3 accepts more capability, making data available to\ncomplaints in a single month law enforcement anywhere.

An attractive deal is created by advertising\nvehicles for sale on various online platforms at prices below\nmarket value. Often the fraudsters claim they must sell\nthe vehicles quickly because they are relocating for work,\nbeing deployed by the military, or have a tragic family\ncircumstance and are in need of money. Because of the\nexigent circumstances, criminals refuse to meet in person\nor allow inspection of the vehicles prior to the sale. To make\nthe deal appear legitimate, the criminal instructs the victim\n\n\nto wire full or partial payment to a third-party agent via a\nwire transfer service, and to fax the payment receipt to the\nseller as proof of payment. The criminal pockets the money\nbut does not deliver a vehicle.\n\nIn a new twist, the criminals have attempted to pose as\ndealers instead of individuals selling a single car. This\nallows them to advertise multiple vehicles for sale at one\ntime on certain platforms, potentially exposing more\nvictims to the scam.\n\n|Age Range|Complaints|Loss|\n|---|---|---|\n|Under 20|299|$510,247.53|\n|20 - 29|1,580|$3,133,594.56|\n|30 - 39|1,406|$3,393,465.57|\n|40 - 49|1,453|$3,959,961.81|\n|50 - 59|1,123|$3,451,918.73|\n|60 & Over|421|$1,735,360.22|\n|Total|6,282|$16,184,548.42|\n\n|Age Range|Complaints|Loss|\n|---|---|---|\n|Under 20|349|$773,384.68|\n|20 - 29|1,958|$5,022,406.66|\n|30 - 39|2,177|$11,960,457.40|\n|40 - 49|2,467|$9,891,248.53|\n|50 - 59|2,372|$11,951,607.16|\n|60 & Over|1,554|$8,788,682.12|\n|Total|10,877|$48,387,786.55|\n\n|Age Range|Complaints|Loss|\n|---|---|---|\n|Under 20|648|$1,283,632.21|\n|20 - 29|3,538|$8,156,001.22|\n|30 - 39|3,583|$15,353,922.97|\n|40 - 49|3,920|$13,851,210.34|\n|50 - 59|3,495|$15,403,525.89|\n|60 & Over|1,975|$10,524,042.34|\n|Total|17,159|$64,572,334.97|\n\n\nFemale Male Total\n\nAge Range Complaints Loss Age Range Complaints Loss Age Range Complaints Loss\n\nUnder 20 299 $510,247.53 Under 20 349 $773,384.68 Under 20 648 $1,283,632.21\n\n20 - 29 1,580 $3,133,594.56 20 - 29 1,958 $5,022,406.66 20 - 29 3,538 $8,156,001.22\n\n30 - 39 1,406 $3,393,465.57 30 - 39 2,177 $11,960,457.40 30 - 39 3,583 $15,353,922.97\n\n40 - 49 1,453 $3,959,961.81 40 - 49 2,467 $9,891,248.53 40 - 49 3,920 $13,851,210.34\n\n50 - 59 1,123 $3,451,918.73 50 - 59 2,372 $11,951,607.16 50 - 59 3,495 $15,403,525.89\n\n60 & Over 421 $1,735,360.22 60 & Over 1,554 $8,788,682.12 60 & Over 1,975 $10,524,042.34\n\nTotal 6,282 $16,184,548.42 Total 10,877 $48,387,786.55 Total 17,159 $64,572,334.97\n\n\n60 & Over\n\n50 - 59\n\n\n40 - 49\n\n30 - 39\n\n\n20 - 29\n\nUnder 20\n\n\n###### Auto Fraud Demographics\n\nFemale Male Total\n\nAge Range Complaints Loss Age Range Complaints Loss Age Range Complaints Loss\n\n299 $510,247.53 Under 20 349 $773,384.68 Under 20 648 $1,283,632.21\n\n1,580 $3,133,594.56 20 - 29 1,958 $5,022,406.66 20 - 29 3,538 $8,156,001.22\n\n1,406 $3,393,465.57 30 - 39 2,177 $11,960,457.40 30 - 39 3,583 $15,353,922.97\n\n1,453 $3,959,961.81 40 - 49 2,467 $9,891,248.53 40 - 49 3,920 $13,851,210.34\n\n1,123 $3,451,918.73 50 - 59 2,372 $11,951,607.16 50 - 59 3,495 $15,403,525.89\n\n421 $1,735,360.22 60 & Over 1,554 $8,788,682.12 60 & Over 1,975 $10,524,042.34\n\n6,282 $16,184,548.42 Total 10,877 $48,387,786.55 Total 17,159 $64,572,334.97\n\n0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500\n\n\nComplaint Count\n\n\nMale Female\n\n\n-----\n\n###### FBI Impersonation E-mail Scam\n\nThe names of various government agencies and highranking government officials have been used in spam\nattacks in an attempt to defraud consumers. Government\nagencies do not send unsolicited e-mails. Complaints\nrelated to spam e-mails purportedly sent from the FBI\ncontinued to be reported with high frequency to the IC3.\nIn 2012, the IC3 received about 47 complaints per day of\nthis type. With an average adjusted loss of approximately\n$141 per complaint, victims reported losing more than\n$6,604 to this scam every day.\n\n\nComplaints that directly spoof the name of FBI Director Robert\nMueller continue to make up a large part of the government\nimpersonation e-mail scams. Those complaints include elements\nof Nigerian scam letters (also known as 419 scams) incorporating\nget-rich inheritance scenarios, bogus lottery winning\nnotifications and occasional extortion threats. A vast majority\nof the Mueller spoof complaints are simply reports of probable\nfraud with no monetary losses incurred by the filer. Nevertheless,\nthe spoofs continue to pose a viable threat to national security by\nundermining public trust that directly impacts law enforcement’s\nability to do its job.\n\n\n###### FBI Impersonation E-mail Scam Demographics\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Intimidation/Extortion Scams\n\nIntimidation and extortion scams have evolved over the\nyears to include some of the following scams.\n\n###### Telephone Calls\n\nIn a twist to the pop-up scareware scheme, victims began\nreceiving telephone calls from individuals allegedly claiming\nto be from legitimate well-known software companies.\nThe victims of these calls were advised malware had been\ndetected on their computers and posed an impending threat.\nThe fraudsters tried to instill a feeling of urgency so victims\nwould take immediate action and log on to their computers.\nOnce the victims logged in, the fraudsters directed them\nto the utility area of the computers, where they appeared\nto demonstrate how the computers were infected. The\nfraudsters offered to rid the computers of the malware for\nfees ranging from $49 to $450. When the victims agreed\nto pay the fees, they were directed to a website where they\nentered a code or downloaded a software program that\nallowed the fraudsters remote access to their computers.\n\n###### Payday Loan\n\nThe payday loan scam involves victims receiving\nharassing telephone calls from individuals claiming they\nare delinquent in payments. The callers purport to be\nrepresentatives of federal government agencies, various law\nfirms and other legitimate sounding agencies. The callers\nhave accurate information associated with the victims,\nincluding Social Security number, date of birth, address,\nemployer information, bank account numbers, and names\nand telephone numbers of relatives and friends. The callers\nclaim to be collectors for debt-collecting companies.\n\nThe fraudsters are relentless in the number of calls made to\nthe victims’ homes, cell phones and places of employment.\nThe callers will not provide any details of the alleged payday\nloans and become abusive when questioned. The fraudsters\nthreaten the victims with legal actions, arrests, and in some\ncases, physical violence if they refuse to pay. Often, the\ncallers resort to harassment of the victims’ relatives, friends\nand employers.\n\nThe fraudsters asked some victims to fax a statement\nagreeing to pay a specified amount via a prepaid money\ncard. It also stated the victim would never dispute the debt.\n\n\nIn a slight twist to the scam, the fraudster advised not only\nwere there warrants for the victims for non-payment, but\nthere were also warrants for hacking into a specific business\nwith the intent of obtaining customer information.\n\n###### Process Server\n\nThe fraudsters added a somewhat different approach to\ntheir intimidation tactics when a person purporting to be\na process server for the court appeared at a victim’s place of\nemployment and at the home of another victim allegedly to\nserve papers for a court date. The process server requested\na debit card number for payment to be made in order to\navoid the court process.\n\n###### The Grandparent Scam\n\nA telephone scam targeting grandparents, and appropriately\nnamed “The Grandparent Scam,” has continued to resurface\nover the years. The scam involves fraudsters calling elderly\nindividuals claiming to be a grandson or granddaughter or\nother young relative in a legal or financial crisis. The crises\ngenerally involve claims of being arrested or in a car accident\nin another country. The callers create a sense of urgency and\nmake a desperate plea for money, begging the grandparents\nnot to tell the parents while often crying to help prevent the\npotential victims from discovering the scam.\n\nThe callers also impersonated third parties, such as an\nattorney or an official, like a U.S. Embassy representative.\nOnce the potential victims appear to believe the caller,\nthey are provided instructions to wire money to a specified\nindividual, often referred to as a bail bondsman, in order for\ntheir grandchild to be released by foreign law enforcement.\nInvestigations have determined potential victims were\nidentified via mass-produced lead lists that target specific\ndemographics.\n\nComplaints reported the callers were from Canada, the\nUnited States, Mexico, Haiti, Guatemala, Peru and the\nDominican Republic. To further obfuscate themselves,\nthe callers used telephone numbers generated by free\napps, so the bogus telephone number appears on the\nrecipient’s caller ID.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Intimidation/Extortion Scams Demographics\n\n|Age Range|Complaints|Loss|\n|---|---|---|\n|Under 20|52|$31,813.03|\n|20 - 29|994|$380,155.16|\n|30 - 39|1,366|$960,378.34|\n|40 - 49|1,167|$1,782,876.94|\n|50 - 59|939|$1,342,004.81|\n|60 & Over|616|$1,934,196.72|\n|Total|5,134|$6,431,425.00|\n\n|Age Range|Complaints|Loss|\n|---|---|---|\n|Under 20|35|$6,389.53|\n|20 - 29|557|$472,870.60|\n|30 - 39|787|$885,411.18|\n|40 - 49|671|$924,169.55|\n|50 - 59|647|$805,667.03|\n|60 & Over|493|$1,098,494.25|\n|Total|3,190|$4,193,002.14|\n\n|Age Range|Complaints|Loss|\n|---|---|---|\n|Under 20|87|$38,202.56|\n|20 - 29|1,551|$853,025.76|\n|30 - 39|2,153|$1,845,789.52|\n|40 - 49|1,838|$2,707,046.49|\n|50 - 59|1,586|$2,147,671.84|\n|60 & Over|1,109|$3,032,690.97|\n|Total|8,324|$10,624,427.14|\n\n\nFemale Male Total\n\nAge Range Complaints Loss Age Range Complaints Loss Age Range Complaints Loss\n\nUnder 20 52 $31,813.03 Under 20 35 $6,389.53 Under 20 87 $38,202.56\n\n20 - 29 994 $380,155.16 20 - 29 557 $472,870.60 20 - 29 1,551 $853,025.76\n\n30 - 39 1,366 $960,378.34 30 - 39 787 $885,411.18 30 - 39 2,153 $1,845,789.52\n\n40 - 49 1,167 $1,782,876.94 40 - 49 671 $924,169.55 40 - 49 1,838 $2,707,046.49\n\n50 - 59 939 $1,342,004.81 50 - 59 647 $805,667.03 50 - 59 1,586 $2,147,671.84\n\n60 & Over 616 $1,934,196.72 60 & Over 493 $1,098,494.25 60 & Over 1,109 $3,032,690.97\n\nTotal 5,134 $6,431,425.00 Total 3,190 $4,193,002.14 Total 8,324 $10,624,427.14\n\n\n60 & Over\n\n50 - 59\n\n\n40 - 49\n\n30 - 39\n\n\n20 - 29\n\nUnder 20\n\n\n0 300 600 900 1,200 1,500\n\nComplaint Count Male Female\n_Note: The percentages shown represent the number of total complaints by age group received for each frequently reported Internet fraud category._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Hit Man Scam\n\nThe IC3 began receiving reports about the hit man/extortion\ne-mail scheme seven years ago, and over time the content of\nthe hit man e-mails has changed, but the intent remains the\nsame – to defraud people through disturbing e-mails.\n\n\nunless a ransom was paid within 48 hours.

An interested party will contact\nthe “homeowner” via e-mail, and usually explain that he or\nshe had to leave the United States quickly because of some\nmissionary or contract work in Africa. Victims are usually\ninstructed to send money overseas—enough to cover the first\nand last month’s rent—via a wire transfer service (scammers\noften believe money cannot be traced once it gets picked\nup on the other end). Renters might also be asked to fill\nout credit applications asking for personal information like\ncredit history, Social Security numbers and work history. The\nscammers then use this information to commit identity theft.\n\n###### Timeshare Marketing Scams\n\nTimeshare owners across the country are being scammed\nout of millions of dollars by unscrupulous companies that\npromise to sell or rent the properties. In the typical scam,\ntimeshare owners receive unexpected or uninvited telephone\ncalls or e-mails from criminals posing as sales representatives\nfor a timeshare resale company. The representative\npromises a quick sale, often within 60 to 90 days. The sales\nrepresentatives frequently use high-pressure sales tactics\nto add a sense of urgency to the deal. Some victims have\nreported that sales representatives pressured them by\nclaiming there was a buyer waiting in the wings, either\non the other line or even present in the office. Timeshare\nowners who agree to sell are told that they must pay an upfront fee to cover anything from listing and advertising fees\nto closing costs. Many victims have provided credit cards to\npay the fees ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand\ndollars. Once the fee is paid, timeshare owners report that\n\n\nthe company becomes evasive — calls go unanswered,\nnumbers are disconnected and websites are inaccessible. In\nsome cases, timeshare owners who have been defrauded by\na timeshare sales scheme have been subsequently contacted\nby an unscrupulous timeshare fraud recovery company\nas well. The representative from the recovery company\npromises assistance in recovering money lost in the sales\nscam. Some recovery companies require an up-front fee for\nservices rendered while others promise no fees will be paid\nunless a refund is obtained for the timeshare owner. The IC3\nhas identified some instances in which people involved with\nthe recovery company also have a connection to the resale\ncompany, raising the possibility that timeshare owners are\nbeing scammed twice by the same people.\n\n###### Loan Modification Scams\n\nA loan modification scam often starts when a bogus loan\ncompany contacts a distraught homeowner and offers a\nloan modification plan via phone call, e-mail or mailing. A\nhomeowner may reach out to these companies after seeing\nan ad online or in the newspaper. The loan modification\ntypically includes a lower interest rate, an extension in the\nlength of the loan term, a change in the type of loan or any\ncombination of the three.\n\nAs a part of this scam, the company instructs the homeowner\nto cease all communication with lenders and stop making\nmortgage payments until the loan modification process\nis complete. The homeowner is required to send money\nto cover “processing fees” and “closing costs” in order\nfor the new loan to be processed and approved. After the\nhomeowner sends the money, the loan company ceases\ncommunication, leaving the homeowner behind on actual\nmortgage payments and unable to recover funds sent to the\nbogus company.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Real Estate Fraud Demographics\n\n|Age Range|Complaints|Loss|\n|---|---|---|\n|Under 20|161|$70,150.83|\n|20 - 29|2,412|$950,220.95|\n|30 - 39|2,180|$1,187,769.35|\n|40 - 49|1,826|$1,737,254.07|\n|50 - 59|1,557|$1,772,178.33|\n|60 & Over|793|$1,757,110.39|\n|Total|8,929|$7,474,683.92|\n\n|Age Range|Complaints|Loss|\n|---|---|---|\n|Under 20|53|$34,200.88|\n|20 - 29|1,174|$729,555.84|\n|30 - 39|1,350|$792,440.36|\n|40 - 49|1,156|$1,797,935.49|\n|50 - 59|1,010|$2,366,252.65|\n|60 & Over|760|$2,223,710.68|\n|Total|5,503|$7,944,095.90|\n\n|Age Range|Complaints|Loss|\n|---|---|---|\n|Under 20|214|$104,306.71|\n|20 - 29|3,586|$1,679,776.79|\n|30 - 39|3,530|$1,980,209.71|\n|40 - 49|2,982|$3,535,189.56|\n|50 - 59|2,567|$4,138,430.98|\n|60 & Over|1,553|$3,980,821.07|\n|Total|14,432|$15,418,734.82|\n\n\nFemale Male Total\n\nAge Range Complaints Loss Age Range Complaints Loss Age Range Complaints Loss\n\nUnder 20 161 $70,150.83 Under 20 53 $34,200.88 Under 20 214 $104,306.71\n\n20 - 29 2,412 $950,220.95 20 - 29 1,174 $729,555.84 20 - 29 3,586 $1,679,776.79\n\n30 - 39 2,180 $1,187,769.35 30 - 39 1,350 $792,440.36 30 - 39 3,530 $1,980,209.71\n\n40 - 49 1,826 $1,737,254.07 40 - 49 1,156 $1,797,935.49 40 - 49 2,982 $3,535,189.56\n\n50 - 59 1,557 $1,772,178.33 50 - 59 1,010 $2,366,252.65 50 - 59 2,567 $4,138,430.98\n\n60 & Over 793 $1,757,110.39 60 & Over 760 $2,223,710.68 60 & Over 1,553 $3,980,821.07\n\nTotal 8,929 $7,474,683.92 Total 5,503 $7,944,095.90 Total 14,432 $15,418,734.82\n\n\n60 & Over\n\n50 - 59\n\n\n40 - 49\n\n30 - 39\n\n\n20 - 29\n\nUnder 20\n\n\n0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500\n\nComplaint Count Male Female\n_Note: The percentages shown represent the number of total complaints by age group received for each frequently reported Internet fraud category._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Romance Scams\n\nPerpetrators use the promise of love and romance to entice and\nmanipulate online victims.

Review the seller’s feedback.\n\n • Be cautious when dealing with individuals outside of your own country.\n\n • Ensure you understand refund, return, and warranty policies.\n\n • Determine the shipping charges before you buy.\n\n • Be wary if the seller only accepts wire transfers or cash.\n\n • Consider insuring your item.\n\n Credit Card Fraud\n\n • If purchasing merchandise, ensure it is from a reputable source. Do research to ensure legitimacy of the individual or company.\n\n • Beware of providing credit card information through unsolicited e-mails.\n\n • Promptly reconcile credit card statements to avoid unauthorized charges.\n\n Debt Elimination\n\n • Know who you are doing business with – do your research. Contact the state Attorney General’s Office or the State Corporation Commission to see if there are any registered complaints.\n\n • Be cautious when dealing with individuals outside of your own country.\n\n • Ensure that you understand all terms and conditions of any agreement.\n\n • Be wary of businesses that operate from P.O. boxes or mail drops.\n\n Employment/Business Opportunities\n\n • Be wary of inflated claims of product effectiveness.\n\n • Be cautious of exaggerated claims of possible earnings or profits\n\n\n\n###### • Beware when money is required up front for instructions or products.\n\n • Be suspicious when the job posting claims “no experience necessary.”\n\n • Do not give your Social Security number when first interacting with your prospective employer.\n\n • Be wary when replying to unsolicited e-mails for work-at-home employment.\n\n Identity Theft\n\n • Ensure websites are secure before submitting a credit card number.\n\n • Never throw away credit card or bank statements in usable form.\n\n • Be aware of missed bills, which could indicate the account has been taken over.\n\n • Be cautious of scams requiring personal information.\n\n • Never give a credit card number over the phone unless you make the call.\n\n • Monitor credit statements monthly for any fraudulent activity. Review a copy of your credit report at least once a year.\n\n • Report unauthorized transactions to bank or credit card companies as soon as possible.\n\n Investment Fraud, Ponzi and Pyramid Schemes\n\n • If the opportunity appears too good to be true, it probably is.\n\n • Beware of promises to make fast profits.\n\n • Be wary of investments that offer high returns at little or no risk.\n\n • Be cautious when you are required to bring in subsequent investors.\n\n • Do not invest in anything unless you understand\n\n\n-----\n\n###### • Independently verify the terms of any investment that you intend to make. Beware of references given by the promoter.\n\n • Do not assume a company is legitimate based on the appearance of the website.\n\n • Be cautious when responding to investment offers received through unsolicited e-mail.\n\n Lotteries\n\n • Be wary if you do not remember entering a lottery or contest.\n\n • Be cautious if you receive a telephone call stating you are the winner of a lottery.\n\n • Beware of lotteries that charge a fee before delivering your prize.\n\n • Be wary of demands to send additional money to be eligible for future winnings.\n\n • Know that it is a violation of federal law to play a foreign lottery via mail or phone.\n\n Phishing/Spoofing\n\n • Be suspicious of any unsolicited e-mail requesting personal information.\n\n • Avoid filling out forms in e-mail messages that ask for personal information. This could be a phishing scam.\n\n • Always compare the link in the e-mail to the link that you are actually directed to visit.\n\n • Log on to the entity’s official website instead of “linking” to it from an unsolicited e-mail.\n\n • Contact the actual business that supposedly sent the e-mail to verify if the e-mail is genuine.\n\n Reshipping\n\n • Be cautious if you are asked to ship packages to an “overseas home office.”\n\n • Be suspicious if an individual states that his country will not allow direct business shipments from the United States.\n\n\n\n###### • Be wary if the ship-to address is yours but the name on the package is not.\n\n • Do not accept packages you did not order.\n\n • If you receive packages you did not order, either refuse delivery or contact the company that sent the package.\n\n Romance Scams\n\n • Be cautious of individuals who claim it was destiny or fate and you are meant to be together, or claim God brought you to him/her. They often claim to love you within 24-48 hours.\n\n • These individuals want your address to send you flowers, candy and teddy bears, often purchased with stolen credit cards.\n\n • They ask for your phone number, but when they call, you can barely understand them.\n\n • Be wary if an individual tells you they are so in love with you that they cannot live without you but they need you to send them some money so they can come to see you. To them, love equals financial assistance. If you do not send them money or help them out with what they ask, you do not love them.\n\n • They typically claim to be from the United States (or your local region) but they are overseas, or going overseas, mainly to Nigeria, sometimes the United Kingdom, for business or family matters.\n\n Spam\n\n • Do not open spam. Delete it.\n\n • Never respond to spam because this will confirm to the sender that it is a valid e-mail address.\n\n • Have a primary and secondary e-mail address — one for people you know and one for all other purposes.\n\n • Avoid giving out your e-mail address unless you know how it will be used.\n\n • Never purchase anything advertised through unsolicited e-mail.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Appendix III\n\n Complainant Statistics\n\n Complainant Statistics by State*\n\nRank State Percent Rank State Percent\n\n1 California 13.40% 27 Louisiana 1.15%\n2 Florida 7.97% 28 Connecticut 1.08%\n3 Texas 7.22% 29 Kentucky 1.08%\n4 New York 5.70% 30 Oklahoma 0.95%\n5 New Jersey 3.81% 31 Kansas 0.84%\n6 Pennsylvania 3.69% 32 Arkansas 0.80%\n7 Illinois 3.50% 33 Utah 0.78%\n8 Virginia 3.29% 34 Iowa 0.75%\n9 Ohio 3.05% 35 Alaska 0.65%\n10 Washington 2.71% 36 New Mexico 0.64%\n11 North Carolina 2.64% 37 Mississippi 0.61%\n12 Georgia 2.60% 38 West Virginia 0.53%\n13 Maryland 2.59% 39 Idaho 0.49%\n14 Michigan 2.58% 40 Hawaii 0.47%\n15 Arizona 2.52% 41 Nebraska 0.46%\n16 Colorado 2.34% 42 New Hampshire 0.44%\n17 Tennessee 1.99% 43 Maine 0.40%\n18 Indiana 1.86% 44 Montana 0.33%\n19 Massachusetts 1.84% 45 District of Columbia 0.30%\n20 Missouri 1.69% 46 Rhode Island 0.30%\n21 Alabama 1.54% 47 Delaware 0.30%\n22 Wisconsin 1.51% 48 Vermont 0.19%\n23 Nevada 1.50% 49 Wyoming 0.19%\n24 Oregon 1.44% 50 North Dakota 0.18%\n25 South Carolina 1.40% 51 South Dakota 0.16%\n26 Minnesota 1.31%\n\n_*Note: This is the total number of complaints from each state and the District of Columbia.
