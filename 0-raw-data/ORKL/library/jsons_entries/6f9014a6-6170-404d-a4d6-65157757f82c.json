Threat Actor ITG08 Strikes Again\n\n**[securityintelligence.com/posts/more_eggs-anyone-threat-actor-itg08-strikes-again/](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/more_eggs-anyone-threat-actor-itg08-strikes-again/)**\n\n[Advanced Threats August 29, 2019](https://securityintelligence.com/category/x-force/threats/)\nBy [Ole Villadsen co-authored by Kevin Henson,](https://securityintelligence.com/author/ole-villadsen/) [Melissa Frydrych,](https://securityintelligence.com/author/melissa-frydrych/) [Joey Victorino 14 min read](https://securityintelligence.com/author/joey-victorino/)\n[IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) responds to security incidents across the](https://www.ibm.com/security/services/ibm-x-force-incident-response-and-intelligence)\nglobe. During a recent incident response investigation, our team identified new attacks by the financially\n[motivated attack group ITG08, also known as FIN6.](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0037/)\n\n\n-----\n\nITG08 is an organized cybercrime gang that has been active since 2015, mostly targeting point-of-sale (POS)\nmachines in brick-and-mortar retailers and companies in the hospitality sector in the U.S. and Europe. More\nrecently, the group has been observed targeting e-commerce environments by injecting malicious code into\nonline checkout pages of compromised websites — a technique known as online skimming — thereby\nstealing payment card data transmitted to the vendor by unsuspecting customers.\n\nBased on our investigation and analysis of its adversarial tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), we\nbelieve ITG08 is actively attacking multinational organizations, targeting specific employees with spear\n[phishing emails advertising fake job advertisements and repeatedly deploying the More_eggs JScript](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0284/)\nbackdoor malware (aka Terra Loader, SpicyOmelette). This tool, a TTP observed in ITG08 attacks since\n2018, is sold on the dark web by an underground malware-as-a-service (MaaS) provider. Attackers use it to\ncreate, expand and cement their foothold in compromised environments. Past campaigns by ITG08 using the\n[More_eggs backdoor were last reported in February 2019.](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/support-legal/documents/fin6-cybercrime-group-expands-threat-To-ecommerce-merchants.pdf)\n\nIn the campaign we investigated, the attackers employed additional TTPs historically associated with ITG08,\nincluding the use of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to automate the remote execution of\n[PowerShell scripts, PowerShell commands with base64 encoding, and Metasploit and PowerShell to move](https://www.metasploit.com/)\nlaterally and deploy malware. Lastly, the attackers used Comodo code-signing certificates several times\nduring the course of the campaign. Many of the above TTPs are not unique to ITG08, but collectively, and\nwith the use of More_eggs, strengthen the link to this group.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at ITG08’s TTPs that are relevant to the campaign we investigated, starting with its\nspear phishing and intrusion tactics and covering information on its use of the More_eggs backdoor. Please\nnote that [Visa has attributed the use of this backdoor to FIN6 in attacks that took place in 2018. Further](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/support-legal/documents/fin6-cybercrime-group-expands-threat-To-ecommerce-merchants.pdf)\nlinking the activity with the same threat actor, several of the network indicators and TTPs we encountered in\nthis case — including the use of fake job advertisements as a lure in spear phishing — overlap with those\n[reported earlier in 2019 by both Visa and Proofpoint researchers.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/fake-jobs-campaigns-delivering-moreeggs-backdoor-fake-job-offers)\n\n## Analysis of the Intrusion\n\n[ITG08’s TTPs in compromising targeted organizations follow the typical framework for APT attacks. The](https://securityintelligence.com/how-the-ibm-x-force-iris-cyberattack-framework-helps-security-teams-reduce-risk-at-all-levels/)\nfollowing sections go over the steps taken by the attackers to gain an initial foothold and persist on the\nvictimized organization’s networks.\n\n### Initial Compromise\n\nTo gain access to victim environments, the threat actor began by targeting handpicked employees using\nLinkedIn messaging and email, advertising fake jobs to lure recipients into checking into the supposed offers.\nIn one case, we uncovered evidence indicating that the attacker had established communication with a victim\nvia email and convinced them to click on a Google Drive URL purporting to contain an attractive job advert.\nOnce clicked, the URL displayed the message, “Online preview is not available,” then presented a second\nURL leading to a compromised or rogue domain, where the victim could download the payload under the\nguise of a job description:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Link provided in spear phishing email to an employee_\n\nThat URL, in turn, downloaded a ZIP file containing a malicious Windows Script File (WSF) that initiated the\ninfection routine of the More_eggs backdoor:\n\n_Figure 2: Final landing page that downloads a malicious file_\n\nBased on file system artifacts examined during our investigation, the ZIP file and WSF files were deleted\nupon a successful malware infection, likely in an attempt to prevent researchers from recovering the original\nfiles from the filesystem. The filesystem, however, contained evidence of a nonmalicious decoy document\n\n\n-----\n\ndropped to the disk drive during the spear phishing attacks.\n\n### Gaining a Foothold\n\nThe spear phishing attacks unfortunately led to initial compromise and the installation of the More_eggs\nJScript backdoor, which established a reverse shell connection to the attacker’s command-and-control (C&C)\ninfrastructure. Additional capabilities of the More_eggs malware include the download and execution of files\nand scripts and running commands using cmd.exe.\n\nX-Force IRIS determined that the More_eggs backdoor later downloaded additional files, including a signed\nbinary shellcode loader and a signed Dynamic Link Library (DLL), as described below, to create a reverse\nshell and connect to a remote host. The shellcode loader was observed on one infected device as\n_updater.exe with the Metasploit-style service name APTYnDS1ABEuUHEA, indicating that it was installed as_\na service.\n\n### Reconnaissance, Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation\n\nOnce the attackers established a foothold on the network, they employed WMI and PowerShell techniques to\nperform network reconnaissance and move laterally within the environment. This type of method, called living\noff the land, can often blend with legitimate system administration activities, which can make it challenging for\nsecurity controls to detect.\n\nThe attackers used this technique to remotely install a Metasploit reverse TCP stager on select systems,\n[subsequently spawning a Meterpreter session and Mimikatz. Meterpreter is a payload component in the](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3353416/what-is-mimikatz-and-how-to-defend-against-this-password-stealing-tool.html)\nMetasploit Framework that uses in-memory DLL injection, which can lead to a compromise by malware or\nany malicious code/commands. Mimikatz is a post-exploitation tool that allows attackers to extract credentials\nfrom volatile memory. Stolen credentials are usually leveraged to facilitate privilege escalation and further\nlateral movement through the compromised environment.\n\nOnce the Metasploit reverse TCP stager executed, it downloaded and loaded a second stage Meterpreter\nDLL into memory, allowing the attacker to spawn a Meterpreter session via a handler and initiate the loading\nof extensions, such as Mimikatz. In addition to the More_eggs malware, the attacker leveraged in-memory\nattacks by injecting malicious code, in this case Mimikatz, into legitimate system processes.\n\n### Establishing Persistence\n\nTo cement their foothold and add persistence throughout the compromised environment, X-Force IRIS\nuncovered evidence that the attacker had selected several additional devices on which to install the\nMore_eggs backdoor, creating redundancy in ways to get back into the network. ITG08 remotely connected\nto these devices using PowerShell and WMI and downloaded and executed a DLL file, subsequently\ninstalling More_eggs on the device without dropping the nonmalicious decoy document.\n\n## More_eggs: Malware Analysis\n\n### ITG08 Leveraging a Malware-as-a-Service Provider\n\nA recently rising attack tool in ITG08 campaigns has been the More_eggs JScript backdoor. But while it was\nrecently identified with ITG08 activity, the More_eggs backdoor is apparently developed and sold through an\n[underground MaaS provider. This vendor not only supplies the backdoor malware, but also offers related](https://medium.com/@quoscient/golden-chickens-uncovering-a-malware-as-a-service-maas-provider-and-two-new-threat-actors-using-61cf0cb87648)\ntechnical services, such as preparing the network infrastructure to download More_eggs-related files and\nfurnishing resources for C&C purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to More_eggs, the same underground vendor is also responsible for producing the signed DLL\ndescribed below, which creates a reverse shell (ReverseShell Executable). We based this assessment on\ncode similarities between the DLL and other samples created by the same vendor, including the DLL that\ndrops the More_eggs backdoor.\n\n_Figure 3: Network indicators revealing the use of an underground MaaS vendor selling More_eggs and_\n_malicious infrastructure services_\n\n### The More_eggs Dropper DLL\n\nAfter a successful phishing attack in which users have opened emails and browsed to malicious links, ITG08\nattackers install the More_eggs JScript backdoor on user devices alongside several other malware\ncomponents.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe process begins with the consistent execution of a malicious DLL using the legitimate regsvr32.exe\nWindows Utility. Once executed, the DLL is deleted from the system and its components are dropped to the\nsystem.\n\nBefore being deleted, the DLL executes a string decoding routine that is designed to execute for about a\nminute, spiking central processing unit (CPU) usage for the regsvr32.exe process. Once the strings are\ndecoded, the More_eggs components are decrypted, dropped to the system\n```\n(normally in the %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\ or %ProgramData%\\Microsoft\\ directories) and\n\n```\nexecuted.\n\nThe observed strings appearing like HEX-encoded strings are shown below:\n\n_Figure 4: Sample encoded and decoded strings_\n\n### More_eggs Components\n\nThe More_eggs dropper DLL creates the following components on the infected device (further detail on each\ncomponent in the chart follows in the next section):\n\n**Sample File Name** **Description**\n\n5795C3AC7F57F.txt An XSL stylesheet file that contains an obfuscated More_eggs JScript\nloader.\n\n625222E09B6CD028459.txt Benign XML document occasionally used as a parameter when executing\nthe msxsl.exe utility.\n\n27603.docx Benign Word Document decoy. The Decoy was not always dropped in the\nexecutions of the DLLs analyzed.\n\nA70613FF7F5DE98.txt Obfuscated script file that executes msxsl.exe with the appropriate\nparameters as arguments. Once the script executes, the More_eggs JScript\nis loaded into the memory space of msxsl.exe.\n\nmsxsl.exe Benign Microsoft Command Line Transformation Utility known to be used to\nexecute malicious code and bypass application whitelisting.\n\n_Figure 5: Components created by DLL_\n\n_msxsl.exe is executed by the script file A70613FF7F5DE98.txt, which is obfuscated as shown below:_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Obfuscated script file A70613FF7F5DE98.txt_\n\nThe use of msxsl.exe is a known tactic to execute malicious code and bypass application whitelisting. The\ndeobfuscated command is built as follows:\n\n_“C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\msxsl.exe” “C:\\Users\\_\n_<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\625222E09B6CD028459.txt” “C:\\Users\\_\n_<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\5795C3AC7F57F.txt”_\n\nOnce the above command is executed, the More_eggs JScript loader 5795C3AC7F57F.txt will deobfuscate\nthe embedded More_eggs JScript. A sample loader is shown below.\n\nThe start of the XSL file:\n\n_Figure 7: JScript loader sample_\n\nThe end of the XSL file:\n\n_Figure 8: JScript loader sample_\n\nThe “select” value within the template tag points to the function in the msxsl:script tag, which will execute\nwhen the msxsl.exe command is run. The JScript loader file is highly obfuscated and decodes the More_eggs\nbackdoor in a variety of ways, including RC4 decryption.\n\n### Analyzing the More_eggs JScript Backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\nThe analysis in this section details the functionality of More_eggs backdoor samples specific to this\ninvestigation, so please bear in mind that the same malware can be deployed differently in other campaigns\nand by alternate attackers.\n\nThe core functionality of the samples analyzed in this campaign remained the same as described by previous\nresearchers. We aimed to add additional detail about the inner workings of the malware, including its C&C\ncommunications flow, its filesystem activity, and some encryption and encoding schemes used by the\nsamples we analyzed.\n\nThe More_eggs backdoor is executed entirely in memory, never touching the filesystem in an unencrypted\nstate. Notable configuration data is hardcoded and includes its C&C server address, malware version number\nand an Rkey value, which is believed to identify campaign perpetrators to the vendor:\n\nThe Rkey value is appended with a two-byte, pseudorandomly generated string used to construct an\nRC4 key.\nThe Rkey variable is part of the ciphering key used to encrypt C&C communications.\nThe RC4 key is then used to encrypt data, which is additionally basE91 encoded and sent back to the\nC&C. BasE91 is a method for encoding binary as ASCII characters.\n\nUpon initial execution, the backdoor checks its environment to determine whether it is running with\nadministrative or user privileges, and if proper components are present on the system. To check the user’s\nprivilege level on the newly infected device, it attempts to read the registry key HKEY_USERS\\S-1-5_19\\Environment\\TEMP; a successful read means it is running with administrative privileges, and the backdoor_\nbuilds the path %ProgramData%\\Microsoft. If it is not running with administrative privileges, the path\n_%AppData%\\Microsoft is used._\n\nThe More_eggs backdoor obtains the username and computer name of the infected device, and if running\nwith privileges, it reads the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Notepad\\\n_<computername>. If not running with privileges, it reads the key_\n_HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Notepad\\<username> instead._\n\nThe data in these Windows registry keys is expected to be a comma-separated list of files with no extension.\nThe .txt extension is appended to the name by the backdoor. If these files exist along with msxsl.exe in the\nproper location, either %ProgramData%\\Microsoft or %AppData%\\Microsoft, the malware’s execution\ncontinues.\n\nOnce the environment is checked, the backdoor will check for network connectivity by sending an HTTP GET\nrequest to hxxp://www.w3[.]org/1999/XSL/Format, ensuring the response is “This is another XSL\nnamespace\\n.”\n\n_GET /1999/XSL/Format HTTP/1.1_\n_Accept: */*_\n_Accept-Language: en-us_\n_UA-CPU: [CPU version]_\n_Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate_\n_User-Agent: [User agent string here]_\n_Host: www.w3.org_\n_Connection: Keep-Alive,_\n\n_Figure 9: HTTP GET request_\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the connection is successful, the backdoor builds a string formatted with |<random-value>| . The random\nvalue is between 8 and 32 bytes long, RC4-encrypted, basE91 encoded, and subsequently sent to the C&C\nin an HTTP POST request.\n\nThe RC4 key used is generated from the Rkey variable value:\n\n_POST HTTP/1.1_\n_Connection: Keep-Alive_\n_Accept: */*_\n_Accept-Language: en-us_\n_User-Agent: [User agent string]_\n_Content-Length: 36_\n_Host:_\n_6R+#9fWCy)htQSo4:H9&JSMTx|X[OEKj^gXE_\n\n_Figure 10: HTTP POST request_\n\nThe C&C response is expected to be between 8 and 32 bytes long, nothing is done with the server response.\nThe random value acts as a handshake between the backdoor and the C&C, and during failure of any of the\nabove, More_eggs sends an HTTP GET request to 8.8.8.8 with a pseudorandom 8 to 32-byte URI.\n\n_GET /avIRga9sfvjGj3HCPGlgzaBXOof3u7wq HTTP/1.1_\n_Connection: Keep-Alive_\n_Accept: */*_\n_Accept-Language: en-us_\n_User-Agent: [User agent string]_\n_Host: 8.8.8.8_\n\n_Figure 11: HTTP GET request to 8.8.8.8_\n\nIf the handshake is successful, the backdoor proceeds to collect system information from the infected device\nusing a series of WMIC commands.\n\n_“%comspec% /c wmic path win32_Operatingsystem get SerialNumber /FORMAT:Textvaluelist | findstr /R_\n_/C:\\”SerialNumber=\\” >_\n_\\”C:\\\\Users\\\\mal_re\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\12025.txt\\” & vol %HOMEDRIVE% >_\n_\\”C:\\\\Users\\\\mal_re\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\50573.txt\\” & wmic csproduct get Name /FORMAT:Textvaluelist_\n_| findstr /R /C:\\”Name=\\” >_\n_\\”C:\\\\Users\\\\mal_re\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\58678.txt\\” & tasklist /FO CSV /NH >_\n_\\”C:\\\\Users\\\\mal_re\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\39054.txt\\” & ver >_\n_\\”C:\\\\Users\\\\mal_re\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\28535.txt\\” & wmic os get ProductType /FORMAT:Textvaluelist |_\n_findstr /R /C:\\”ProductType=\\” >_\n_\\”C:\\\\Users\\\\mal_re\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\4140.txt\\” & ipconfig | findstr /R /C:\\”IPv4 Address\\” >_\n_\\”C:\\\\Users\\\\mal_re\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\65390.txt\\””_\n\n_Figure 12: System information collection_\n\nThe infected device’s system information is written to several %Temp%\\<random-filenames>.txt files. The\ncontents of the files are read and then the files themselves are deleted.\n\nThe More_eggs backdoor accepts the following commands from its remote operator:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n\n-----\n\nd&exec Download and execute an executable (.exe or .dll).\n\nmore_eggs Delete the current More_eggs and replace it.\n\nGtfo Uninstall activity.\n\nmore_onion Execute a script.\n\nvia_c Run a command using “cmd.exe /C”.\n\n_Figure 13: More_eggs commands_\n\n### Meterpreter Reverse TCP Stagers\n\nBeyond using More_eggs as a backdoor, the attackers in this campaign also used offensive security tools\nand PowerShell scripts to carry out the different stages of the attack.\n\nThe PowerShell scripts analyzed during our investigation contained Metasploit Reverse TCP stagers. These\nstagers were used to execute shellcode that connected back to an attacker’s server and injected Meterpreter\ncomponents, such as Mimikatz, into the memory space of legitimate processes. After injecting Meterpreter\ninto memory, the attacker had complete control of the infected device.\n\nThe reverse TCP PowerShell stagers functioned as follows:\n\n1. The reverse TCP PowerShell stagers were obfuscated with base64 encoding and GZip compression.\n\nThis encoding scheme is standard for Meterpreter PowerShell stagers. The original command\ncontained a base64-encoded loader script.\n2. The loader script base64 decodes, Gzip decompresses and executes a Metasploit PowerShell\n\nreflection payload in memory.\n3. The reflection payload base64 decodes a Meterpreter reverse TCP shellcode, injects it into memory\n\nusing .NET reflection methods and executes the decoded shellcode.\n4. The shellcode connects back to the attacker’s server. Meterpreter components, such as the core\n\nmodule and metsvr.dll, and extensions, such as Mimikatz, are injected into the memory space of a\nlegitimate process.\n\n_Figure 14: Original command_\n\n_Figure 15: Decoded loader_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16: Decoded reflection payload_\n\n### Metasploit Shellcode Loader\n\nAs our analysis continued, X-Force IRIS found a UPX-packed Metasploit shellcode loader (49340.txt) during\nthe forensic investigation of compromised devices. This loader attempted to masquerade as the Apache\nBench application and notably contained metadata and project paths (.PDB), indicating that it may be\nattempting to masquerade as other applications as well, a rather typical behavior for malicious binaries.\n\nThe shellcode was loaded into memory and designed to receive an RC4-encrypted buffer, which was\ndecrypted and executed in memory. The sample also contained a Comodo code-signing certificate issued to\n“MAHTEM LTD,” which we believe is one of a number of fake companies established to purchase the\ncertificates.\n\nThe sample we analyzed further contained five binary entries in a resource named “REGISTRY” — 35, 224,\n409, 3908 and 4994 — each containing some obfuscated shellcode.\n\nOnce loaded into memory, the shellcode connected back to a remote host, receiving 4 bytes in return. Those\nwere XORed with the string 0xad350bdd and had 0x100 added to it. This value was then used as the size\nspecification for the next received buffer, which was RC4-decrypted with the resulting 16-byte key and\nexecuted in memory.\n\n### A ReverseShell Executable\n\nYet another tool in the attackers’ arsenal for this campaign was a DLL backdoor executable that X-Force IRIS\nfound during the investigation. When executed via its DllRegisterServer export function, the DLL connected to\na remote host on port 443 and created a reverse shell. In this investigation, the DLL connected to\n185[.]204[.]2[.]182 and contained a Comodo code-signing certificate issued to “D Bacte Ltd.”\n\n## ITG08 Attacks Organizations for Financial Gain\n\nITG08 has been around for over four years now. Its attacks are financially motivated, sophisticated and\npersistent. The group historically has specialized in stealing payment card data from POS machines and has\nmore recently expanded operations to target card-not-present data from online transactions. To follow\n[information about ITG08 as it emerges, please join us on X-Force Exchange.](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mitigation Tips\n\nEffective network defense and threat intelligence rely on multiple factors, such as knowing the network’s\nattack surface, understanding the threat actor’s motivations and TTPs, and the skill and knowledge of the\nsecurity team that enable it to identify malicious behavior.\n\nIBM X-Force IRIS has gained insight into ITG08’s intrusion methods, ability to navigate laterally, use of\ncustom and open-source tools, and typical persistence mechanisms. Our team has provided the following\nmitigation tips for defenders who are looking out for attacks by this group.\n\n### Educate Users About Email\n\nX-Force IRIS determined that the ITG08 compromise was the result of a phishing email in which the initial\ncompromise was made possible by a victim who clicked on a malicious attachment. Role-based security\nawareness training should be at the top of the list of any organization’s mitigation strategies to help\nemployees recognize phishing emails and possible malicious attachments, and to educate them about their\nsecurity responsibilities with regards to reporting potentially malicious emails.\n\n### Search for Known IoCs\n\nAfter the phishing email resulted in a successful infiltration, ITG08 used the More_eggs backdoor to gain a\nfoothold and infect additional devices. More_eggs-related artifacts such as the DLL dropper have extremely\nlow antivirus (AV) detection rates, based on analysis conducted via VirusTotal (VT). For example, a\nMore_eggs DLL dropper submitted to VT on April 18, 2019 had a detection rate of only 5 percent.\n\nTo detect this malware, critical events should be analyzed based on the attacker’s patterns. SYSMON or an\nendpoint detection and response tool should be configured to detect the combined use of msxsl.exe and\nWMI. In addition, Registry keys and scheduled tasks should be analyzed for indications of persistence. The\nnetwork should also be scrutinized for any privilege escalation events and any signs of internal\nreconnaissance. YARA signatures should also be created to assist security personnel in detecting the\nMore_eggs malware. YARA signatures for X-Force IRIS premium subscribers can be provided on request.\n\n### Analyze Logs\n\nOther mitigation strategies against this type of activity include analyzing host-based firewall logs for internal\npivoting, unauthorized listening executables and scanning activity. In addition, configuring PowerShell script\nlogging and identifying any obfuscation will assist in mitigating ITG08’s use of PowerShell to conduct\nmalicious activity. ITG08 has also demonstrated the use of stolen credentials; therefore, multiple failed login\nattempts and/or unauthorized account usage may be indicators of ITG08 activity on a network.\n\n### Monitor for Remote Services\n\nX-Force IRIS also recommends taking steps to prevent lateral movement. Although lateral movement can be\ndifficult to detect, a spike in usage of Windows tools, such as remote administration services (PowerShell\nRemoting and WMI), should be monitored. Detection and monitoring capabilities should be in place and\nnetwork defenders should be familiar with what is considered a “normal” baseline on their user network.\nWithout a baseline of “normal” activity, the use of Windows tools may blend in with legitimate activity, which\ncan allow attackers to continue to live off the land unnoticed.\n\n### Rethink Network Architecture\n\n\n-----\n\nSecurity defenders should examine network architecture to see how the network is segregated, what\nWindows tools are restricted or used by administrators, and what alerts are set up to warrant personnel\nreview. Least privilege principals should be implemented for all users on the network, and a strong password\nmanagement system with two-factor authentication and password expiration dates should be deployed as an\nadditional layer of security.\n\n### Pen Test!\n\nOrganizations looking to limit the ways by which attackers can infiltrate their networks should be mindful of\nongoing patching of vulnerabilities. After reaching maturity on the vulnerability assessment front, mitigation\n[strategies should also include penetration testing to find unknown vulnerabilities related to people, software](https://www.ibm.com/security/services/offensive-security-services)\nand hardware used on the organization’s critical assets and externally facing resources.\n\n### Incident Response\n\n[Nowadays, no organization can be exempt from planning and drilling incident response plans in the face of](https://securityintelligence.com/articles/how-to-create-an-effective-incident-response-plan/)\npotential security incidents. Conducting tabletop exercises and regularly drilling plans can help organizations\nproactively prepare and take control of an incident if ever one should occur.\n\n[For additional resources and information, please check out X-Force IRIS. If you believe your organization](https://www.ibm.com/security/services/ibm-x-force-incident-response-and-intelligence)\nmay be under attack, please call the X-Force Emergency Response Hotline at 888-241-9812.\n\n## Appendix A: IoCs\n\n**More_eggs C&C domains:**\n\napi[.]cloudservers[.]kz\nmail[.]rediffmail[.]kz\nsecure[.]cloudserv[.]ink\nmetric[.]onlinefonts[.]kz\nnews[.]bradpitt[.]kz\n\n**Landing page domains (downloads files):**\n\nusastaffing[.]services\nusstaffing[.]services\njobhyper[.]com\n\n**Meterpreter C&C IP addresses:**\n\n185[.]162[.]128[.]70*.\n185[.]243[.]115[.]50\n192[.]99[.]20[.]90\n192[.]187[.]103[.]42\n37[.]1[.]221[.]212.\n\n_*Also the C&C IP address for the Metasploit Shellcode Loader._\n\n**ReverseShell executable (DLL) C&C IP address:**\n\n185[.]204[.]2[.]182\n\n**File hashes:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Description** **SHA256**\n\n5795C3AC7F57F.txt b3537701e054823836da9c532560d30f01e38e549fb813206afd699ecde8a97c\n\nA70613FF7F5DE98.txt 28497c50d65c9f1d0233fc193a43014497fadddb1af8e7f5dbc6eefb3d4ede02\n\n625222E09B6CD028459.txt 80716c2a49739850d8ccd1c035ea4bcc2da39527693c71b800c99ed2ea2c430f\n\nMore_eggs backdoor 37831e465728a913acab317b65c4474b8e6a4570e78c39c8b8c9b956e5d6db25\n\n\nMetasploit Shellcode\nLoader\n\n\nd9a245f1fb502606c226c364aa1090f25916e68f5ff24ef75be87ad6a2e6dcc9\n\n\nReverseShell Executable 78a87d540c1758c6b4dcabb7b825ea3a186ef61e7439045ece3ce3205c7e85a2\n\n[Ole Villadsen](https://securityintelligence.com/author/ole-villadsen/)\nCyber Threat Hunt Analyst, IBM Security\n\nOle Villadsen is an analyst on the Threat Hunt & Discovery Team within IBM X-Force Incident Response and\nIntelligence Services (IRIS), where he investiga...\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
