See the_ _[ATT&CK for Enterprise framework for all referenced threat](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/matrices/enterprise/)_\n_actor techniques._\n\nThis joint advisory is the result of analytic efforts among the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure\nSecurity Agency (CISA), the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) and U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM). Working with U.S.\ngovernment partners, CISA, Treasury, FBI, and USCYBERCOM identified malware and\nindicators of compromise (IOCs) used by the North Korean government in an automated\nteller machine (ATM) cash-out scheme—referred to by the U.S. Government as “FASTCash\n2.0: North Korea's BeagleBoyz Robbing Banks.”\n\nCISA, Treasury, FBI, and USCYBERCOM highlight the cyber threat posed by North Korea—\nformally known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)—and provide\nrecommended steps to mitigate the threat.\n\nRefer to the following Malware Analysis Reports for associated IOCs:\n[CROWDEDFLOUNDER,](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-045c) [ECCENTRICBANDWAGON,](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-239a) [ELECTRICFISH,](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar19-252b) FASTCash for\nWindows, [HOPLIGHT, and](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-045g) [VIVACIOUSGIFT.](https://us-cert.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-239b)\n\n[Click here for a PDF version of this report.](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA20-239A_FASTCash2.0_508.pdf)\n\n!!!WARNING!!!\n\nSince February 2020, North Korea has resumed targeting banks in multiple countries to\ninitiate fraudulent international money transfers and ATM cash outs. The recent resurgence\nfollows a lull in bank targeting since late 2019. This advisory provides an overview of North\nKorea’s extensive, global cyber-enabled bank robbery scheme, a short profile of the group\nresponsible for this activity, in-depth technical analysis, and detection and mitigation\nrecommendations to counter this ongoing threat to the Financial Services sector.\n\n!!!WARNING!!!\n\n### Technical Details\n\nNorth Korea's intelligence apparatus controls a hacking team dedicated to robbing banks\nthrough remote internet access. To differentiate methods from other North Korean malicious\ncyber activity, the U.S. Government refers to this team as BeagleBoyz, who represent a\n\n\n-----\n\nsubset of HIDDEN COBRA activity. The BeagleBoyz overlap to varying degrees with groups\ntracked by the cybersecurity industry as Lazarus, Advanced Persistent Threat 38 (APT38),\nBluenoroff, and Stardust Chollima and are responsible for the FASTCash ATM cash outs\nreported in October 2018, fraudulent abuse of compromised bank-operated SWIFT system\nendpoints since at least 2015, and lucrative cryptocurrency thefts. This illicit behavior has\nbeen identified by the United Nations (UN) DPRK Panel of Experts as evasion of UN\nSecurity Council resolutions, as it generates substantial revenue for North Korea. North\nKorea can use these funds for its UN-prohibited nuclear weapons and ballistic missile\nprograms. Additionally, this activity poses significant operational risk to the Financial Services\nsector and erodes the integrity of the financial system.\n\n**The BeagleBoyz’s bank robberies pose severe operational risk for individual firms**\n**beyond reputational harm and financial loss from theft and recovery costs. The**\nBeagleBoyz have attempted to steal nearly $2 billion since at least 2015, according to public\nestimates. Equally concerning, these malicious actors have manipulated and, at times,\nrendered inoperable, critical computer systems at banks and other financial institutions.\n\nIn 2018, a bank in Africa could not resume normal ATM or point of sale services for its\ncustomers for almost two months following an attempted FASTCash incident.\nThe BeagleBoyz often put destructive anti-forensic tools onto computer networks of\nvictim institutions. Additionally, in 2018, they deployed wiper malware against a bank in\nChile that crashed thousands of computers and servers to distract from efforts to send\nfraudulent messages from the bank’s compromised SWIFT terminal.\n\n**North Korea’s widespread international bank robbery scheme that exploits critical**\n**banking systems may erode confidence in those systems and presents risks to**\n**financial institutions across the world. Any BeagleBoyz robbery directed at one bank**\nimplicates many other financial services firms in both the theft and the flow of illicit funds\nback to North Korea. BeagleBoyz activity fits a known North Korean pattern of abusing the\ninternational financial system for profit.\n\nFraudulent ATM cash outs have affected upwards of 30 countries in a single incident.\nThe conspirators have withdrawn cash from ATM machines operated by various\nunwitting banks in multiple countries, including in the United States.\nThe BeagleBoyz also use unwitting banks, including banks in the United States, for\ntheir SWIFT fraud scheme. These banks are custodians of accounts belonging to\nvictim banks or unknowingly serve as a pass-through for the fraud. Most infamously,\nthe BeagleBoyz stole $81 million from the Bank of Bangladesh in 2016. The Federal\nReserve Bank of New York stopped the remainder of this attempted $1 billion theft after\ndetecting anomalies in the transfer instructions they had received.\n\n\n-----\n\n**FASTCash Update**\n\nNorth Korea’s BeagleBoyz are responsible for the sophisticated cyber-enabled ATM cashout campaigns identified publicly as “FASTCash” in October 2018. Since 2016, the\nBeagleBoyz have perpetrated the FASTCash scheme, targeting banks’ retail payment\nsystem infrastructure (i.e., switch application servers processing International Standards\nOrganization [ISO] 8583 messages, which is the standard for financial transaction\nmessaging).\n\nSince the publication of the in October 2018, there have been two particularly significant\ndevelopments in the campaign: (1) the capability to conduct the FASTCash scheme\nagainst banks hosting their switch applications on Windows servers, and (2) an expansion\nof the FASTCash campaign to target interbank payment processors.\n\nIn October 2018, the U.S. Government identified malware used in the FASTCash\nscheme that has the capability to manipulate AIX servers running a bank's switch\napplication to intercept financial request messages and reply with fraudulent, but\nlegitimate-looking, affirmative response messages to enable extensive ATM cash\nouts. The U.S. Government has since identified functionally equivalent malware for\nthe Windows operating system. Please see the Technical Analysis section below for\nmore information about the ISO 8583 malware for Windows.\nThe BeagleBoyz initially targeted switch applications at individual banks with\nFASTCash malware but, more recently, have targeted at least two regional interbank\npayment processors. This suggests the BeagleBoyz are exploring upstream\nopportunities in the payments ecosystem.\n\nFor more information about FASTCash, please see https://www.uscert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-275A.\n\n## BEAGLEBOYZ Profile\n\nThe BeagleBoyz, an element of the North Korean government’s Reconnaissance General\nBureau, have likely been active since at least 2014. As opposed to typical cybercrime, the\ngroup likely conducts well-planned, disciplined, and methodical cyber operations more akin\nto careful espionage activities. Their malicious cyber operations have netted hundreds of\nmillions of U.S. dollars and are likely a major source of funding for the North Korean regime.\nThe group has always used a calculated approach, which allows them to sharpen their\ntactics, techniques, and procedures while evading detection. Over time, their operations\nhave become increasingly complex and destructive. The tools and implants employed by this\ngroup are consistently complex and demonstrate a strong focus on effectiveness and\noperational security.\n\n### Community Identifiers\n\nThe BeagleBoyz overlap to varying degrees with groups tracked by the cybersecurity\nindustry as: APT38 (FireEye), Bluenoroff (Kaspersky), Lazarus Group (ESTSecurity), and\nStardust Chollima (CrowdStrike).\n\n\n-----\n\n### Targeted Nations\n\nThe BeagleBoyz likely have targeted financial institutions in the following nations from 2015\nthrough 2020: Argentina, Brazil, Bangladesh, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Chile,\nCosta Rica, Ecuador, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Malaysia,\nMalta, Mexico, Mozambique, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Peru,\nPhilippines, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Tanzania, Togo, Turkey,\nUganda, Uruguay, Vietnam, Zambia (figure 1).\n\n_Figure 1: Nations probably targeted by BeagleBoyz since 2015_\n\n### Anatomy of a BeagleBoyz Bank Heist\n\nFigure 2 provides a graphical depiction of a BeagleBoyz bank heist. The next section\ndescribes in detail the end-to-end actions the BeagleBoyz take to rob financial institutions\nwith a malicious cyber operation.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: BeagleBoyz Bank Heist overview_\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nThe BeagleBoyz use a variety of tools and techniques to gain access to a financial\ninstitution’s network, learn the topology to discover key systems, and monetize their access.\nThe technical analysis below represents an amalgamation of multiple known incidents, rather\nthan details of a single operation. These findings are presented to highlight the group’s ability\nto tailor their techniques to different targets and to adapt their methods over time.\nConsequently, there is a need for layered mitigations to effectively defend against this\nactivity, as relying solely on network signature detection will not sufficiently protect against\nNorth Korea’s BeagleBoyz.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Initial Access\n\nThe BeagleBoyz have used a variety of techniques, such as spearphishing and watering\nholes, to enable initial access into targeted financial institutions. Towards the end of 2018\nthrough 2019 and in early 2020, the BeagleBoyz demonstrated the use of social engineering\ntactics by carrying out job-application themed phishing attacks using the following publicly\navailable malicious files.\n\n```\nMD5: b484b0dff093f358897486b58266d069\n\n```\n```\nMD5: f34b72471a205c4eee5221ab9a349c55\n\n```\n```\nMD5: 4c26b2d0e5cd3bfe0a3d07c4b85909a4\n\n```\n```\nMD5: 52ec074d8cb8243976963674dd40ffe7\n\n```\n```\nMD5: d1d779314250fab284fd348888c2f955\n\n```\n```\nMD5: cf733e719e9677ebfbc84a3ab08dd0dc\n\n```\n```\nMD5: 01d397df2a1cf1d4c8e3615b7064856c\n\n```\n\nThe BeagleBoyz may also be working with or contracting out to criminal hacking groups, like\nTA505, for initial access development. The third party typically uses commodity malware to\nestablish initial access on a victim’s network and then turns over the access to the\nBeagleBoyz for follow-on exploitation, which may not occur until months later.\n\nThe BeagleBoyz have also used the following techniques to gain an initial foothold on a\ntargeted computer network (Initial Access [[TA0001]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0001/)\n\nEmail an attachment with malware to a specific individual, company, or industry\n(Phishing: _Spearphishing Attachment_ [[T1566.001])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/001/)\nCompromise a website visited by users in specific communities, industries, or regions\n[(Drive-by Compromise [T1189])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1189/)\nExploit a weakness (a bug, glitch, or design vulnerability) in an internet-facing computer\nsystem (such as a database or web server) (Exploit Public Facing Application [[T1190])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1190/)\nSteal the credentials of a specific user or service account to bypass access controls\n[and gain increased privileges (Valid Accounts [T1078])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1078/)\nBreach organizations that have access to the intended victim’s organization and exploit\ntheir trusted relationship (Trusted Relationship [[T1199])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1199/)\n\n\n-----\n\nUse remote services to initially access and persist within a victim s network (External\n_Remote Services_ [[T1133])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1133/)\n\n### Execution\n\nThe BeagleBoyz selectively exploit victim computer systems after initially compromising a\ncomputer connected to a financial institution’s corporate network. After gaining initial access\nto a financial institution’s corporate network, the BeagleBoyz are selective in which victim\nsystems they further exploit. The BeagleBoyz use a variety of techniques to run their code on\nlocal and remote victim systems [Execution [[TA0002]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0002/)\n\nUse command-line interfaces to interact with systems and execute other software\n(Command and Scripting Interpreter [[T1059])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1059/)\nUse scripts (e.g., VBScript and PowerShell) to speed up operational tasks, reduce the\ntime required to gain access to critical resources, and bypass process monitoring\nmechanisms by directly interacting with the operating system

(Scheduled Task/Job: Cron [T1053.003], Scheduled](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1053/003/)\n_[Task/Job: Launchd [T1053.004])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1053/004/)_\n\n### Persistence\n\nThe BeagleBoyz use many techniques to maintain access on compromised networks\nthrough system restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could affect their\naccess (Persistence [[TA0003]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0003/)\n\nAdd an entry to the “run keys” in the

tiered user\nand system accounts with customized privileges. The BeagleBoyz must overcome these\nrestrictions to access necessary systems, monitor normal user behavior, and install and\nexecute additional malicious tools. To do so, the BeagleBoyz have used the following\ntechniques to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network (Privilege Escalation\n\n[[TA0004]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0004/)\n\nInject code into processes to evade process-based defenses and elevate privileges\n(Process Injection

ECCENTRICBANDWAGON to log key strokes and\ntake screen captures. The U.S. Government has identified some\nECCENTRICBANDWAGON samples that have the ability to RC4 encrypt logged data, but\nthe tool has no network functionality. The implant uses specific formatting for logged data\nand saves the file locally; another tool obtains the logged data. The implant also contains no\nmechanism for persistence or self-loading and expects a specific configuration file to be\npresent on the system. A full technical report for ECCENTRICBANDWAGON is available at\n[https://us-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea)\n\nThe BeagleBoyz may not always need to use custom keyloggers like\nECCENTRICBANDWAGON or other tools to obtain credentials from a compromised system.\nDepending on the victim’s environment, the BeagleBoyz have used the following techniques\nto steal credentials (Credential Access [[TA0006]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0006/)\n\nCapture user input, such as keylogging (the most prevalent type of input capture), to\nobtain credentials for valid accounts and information collection (Input Capture [[T1056])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1056/)\nObtain account login and password information, generally in the form of a hash or a\nclear text password, from the operating system and software (OS Credential Dumping\n\n[[T1056])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1056/)\nGather private keys from compromised systems to authenticate to remote services or\ndecrypt other collected files (Unsecured Credentials: Private Keys [[T1552.004])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1552/004/)\nManipulate default, domain, local, and cloud accounts to maintain access to credentials\nand certain permission levels within an environment (Account Manipulation [[T1098])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1098/)\nAbuse hooking to load and execute malicious code within the context of another\nprocess to mask the execution, allow access to the process's memory, and, possibly,\ngain elevated privileges (Input Capture: Credential API Hooking [[T1056.004])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1056/004/)\n\n\n-----\n\nUse brute force techniques to attempt account access when passwords are unknown\n[or when password hashes are unavailable (Brute Force [T1110])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1110/)\n\n### Discovery\n\nOnce inside a financial institution’s network, the BeagleBoyz appear to seek two specific\nsystems—the SWIFT terminal and the server hosting the institution’s payment switch\napplication. As they progress through a network, they learn about the systems they have\naccessed in order to map the network and gain access to the two goal systems. To do so,\nthe BeagleBoyz have used the following techniques to gain knowledge about the systems\n[and internal network (Discovery [TA0007]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0007/)\n\nAttempt to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware, such as\nversion, patches, hotfixes, service packs, and architecture (System Information\n_Discovery_ [[T1082])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1082/)\nEnumerate files and directories or search in specific locations of a host or network\nshare for particular information within a file system (File and Directory Discovery\n\n[[T1083])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1083/)\nGet a list of security software, configurations, defensive tools, and sensors installed on\nthe system (Software Discovery: Security Software Discovery [[T1518.001])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1518/001/)\nProcure information about running processes on a system to understand standard\nsoftware running on network systems (Process Discovery [[T1057])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1057/)\nIdentify primary users, currently logged in users, sets of users that commonly use a\nsystem, or active or inactive users (System Owner/User Discovery [[T1033])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1033/)\nEnumerate browser bookmarks to learn more about compromised hosts, reveal\npersonal information about users, and expose details about internal network resources\n(Browser Bookmark Discovery [[T1217])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1217/)\nLook for information on network configuration and system settings on compromised\nsystems, or perform remote system discovery (System Network Configuration\n_Discovery_ [[T1016])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1016/)\nInteract with the Windows Registry to gather information about the system,\nconfiguration, and installed software (Query Registry [[T1012])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1012/)\nGet a list of open application windows to learn how the system is used or give context\nto data collected (Application Window Discovery [[T1010])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1010/)\nAttempt to get a listing of local system or domain accounts in the compromised system\n(Account Discovery [[T1087])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1087/)\nObtain a list of network connections to and from the compromised system or remote\nsystem by querying for information over the network (System Network Connections\n_[Discovery [T1049])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1049/)_\n\n### Lateral Movement\n\n\n-----\n\nTo access a compromised financial institution s SWIFT terminal and the server hosting the\ninstitution’s payment switch application, the BeagleBoyz leverage harvested credentials and\ntake advantage of the accessibility of these critical systems from other systems in the\ninstitution’s corporate network. Specifically, the BeagleBoyz have been known to create\nfirewall exemptions on specific ports, including ports 443, 6443, 8443, and 9443. Depending\non the configuration of compromised systems and the security environment of the victim’s\ncomputer network, the BeagleBoyz have used the following techniques to enter and control\nremote systems on a compromised network (Lateral Movement [[TA0008]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0008/)\n\nCopy files from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files throughout\nan operation (Ingress Tool Transfer [[T1105])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1105/)\nUse Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to log into an interactive session with a system\ndesktop GUI on a remote system (Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol\n\n[[T1021.001])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1021/001/)\nEmploy hidden network shares, in conjunction with administrator-level valid accounts,\nto remotely access a networked system over Server Message Block (SMB) in order to\ninteract with systems using remote procedure calls (RPCs), transfer files, and run\ntransferred binaries through remote execution (Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin\n_Shares_ [[T1021.002])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1021/002/)\nExploit valid accounts to log into a service specifically designed to accept remote\nconnections and perform actions as the logged-on user (Remote Services [[T1021])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1021/)\n\n### Collection\n\nDepending on various environmental attributes the BeagleBoyz encounter during their\nexploitation, they may deploy a variety of reconnaissance tools or use commonly available\nadministrative tools for malicious purposes.\n\nThe BeagleBoyz, like other sophisticated cyber actors, also appear to use resident,\nlegitimate administrative tools for reconnaissance purposes when they are available; this is\ncommonly known as “living off the land.” PowerShell appears to be a popular otherwiselegitimate tool the BeagleBoyz favor for reconnaissance activities. For example, the\nBeagleBoyz often use publicly available code from PowerShell Empire for malicious\npurposes.\n\nThe BeagleBoyz have used the following techniques to gather information from exploited\nsystems (Collection [[TA0009]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0009/)\n\nUse automated methods, such as scripts, for collecting data (Automated Collection\n\n[[T1119])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1119/)\nCapture user input to obtain credentials and collect information (Input Capture [[T1056])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1056/)\nCollect local systems data from a compromised system (Data from Local System\n\n[[T1005])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1005/)\nTake screen captures of the desktop (Screen Capture [[T1113])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1113/)\n\n\n-----\n\nCollect data stored in the Windows clipboard from users (Clipboard Data [[T1115])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1115/)\n\n### Command and Control\n\nThe BeagleBoyz likely change tools—such as CROWDEDFLOUNDER and HOPLIGHT—\nover time to maintain remote access to financial institution networks and to interact with\nthose systems.\n\nAnalysis of the following CROWDEDFLOUNDER samples was first released in October\n2018 as part of the FASTCash campaign.\n\n```\nMD5 hash: 5cfa1c2cb430bec721063e3e2d144feb\n\n```\n```\nMD5 hash: 4f67f3e4a7509af1b2b1c6180a03b3e4\n\n```\n\nThe BeagleBoyz have used CROWDEDFLOUNDER as a remote access trojan (RAT) since\nat least 2018. The implant is designed to operate on Microsoft Windows hosts and can\nupload and download files, launch a remote command shell, inject into victim processes,\nobtain user and host information, and securely delete files. The implant may be packed with\nThemida to degrade or prevent effective reverse engineering or evade detection on a\nWindows host. It can be set to act in beacon or listening modes, depending on command line\narguments or configuration specifications. The implant obfuscates network communications\nusing a simple encoding algorithm. The listening mode of CROWDEDFLOUNDER facilitates\nproxies like ELECTRICFISH (discussed below) with tunneling traffic in a victim’s network.\n\nMore recently, the U.S. Government has found HOPLIGHT malware on victim systems,\nsuggesting the BeagleBoyz are using HOPLIGHT for similar purposes. HOPLIGHT has the\nsame basic RAT functionality as the CROWDEDFLOUNDER implant. In addition,\nHOPLIGHT has the capability to create fraudulent Transport Layer Security (TLS) sessions\nto obfuscate command and control (C2) connections, making detection and tracking of the\nmalware’s communications difficult.\n\nFull technical reports for CROWDEDFLOUNDER and HOPLIGHT are available at https://uscert.cisa.gov/northkorea.\n\nThe BeagleBoyz use network proxy tunneling tools—including VIVACIOUSGIFT and\nELECTRICFISH—to tunnel communications from non-internet facing systems like an ATM\nswitch application server or a SWIFT terminal to internet-facing systems. The BeagleBoyz\nuse these network proxy tunneling tools, likely placed at or near a victim’s network boundary,\nto tunnel other protocols such as RDP and Secure Shell or other implant traffic out from the\ninternal network.\n\nIt appears that as the BeagleBoyz change proxy tools, there is some overlap between their\nuse of older and newer malware. For example, the BeagleBoyz appear to have begun using\nELECTRICFISH as they wound down use of VIVACIOUSGIFT. There has been a noticeable\ndecline in ELECTRICFISH use following the U.S. Government’s disclosure of it in May 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\nFull technical reports for VIVACIOUSGIFT and ELECTRICFISH are available at https://uscert.cisa.gov/northkorea.\n\nIn addition to these tools, the BeagleBoyz have used the following techniques to\ncommunicate with financial institution victim systems under their control (Command and\n_Control_ [[TA0011]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0011/)\n\nEmploy known encryption algorithms to conceal C2 traffic (Encrypted Channel [[T1573])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1573/)\nCommunicate over commonly used standard application layer protocols and ports to\navoid detection or detailed inspection and to blend with existing traffic (Application\n_Layer Protocol_ [[T1071])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1071/)\nEncode C2 information using standard data encoding systems such as the American\nStandard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), Unicode, Base64, Multipurpose\nInternet Mail Extensions, and 8-bit Unicode Transformation Format systems or other\nbinary-to-text and character encoding systems (Data Encoding: Standard Encoding\n\n[[T1132.001])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1132/001/)\nCopy files between systems to stage adversary tools or other files (Ingress Transfer\n_Tool_ [[T1105])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1105/)\nUse external previously compromised web services to relay commands to victim\nsystems (Web Service [[T1102])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1102/)\nEmploy a custom C2 protocol that mimics well-known protocols, or develop custom\nprotocols (including raw sockets) to supplement protocols provided by another\n[standard network stack (Non-Application Layer Protocol [T1095])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1095/)\nObfuscate C2 communications (but not necessarily encrypt them) to hide commands\nand make the content less conspicuous and more challenging to discover or decipher\n(Data Obfuscation [[T1101])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1101/)\nEmploy connection proxies to direct network traffic between systems, act as an\nintermediary for network communications to a C2 server, or avoid direct connections to\nits infrastructure (Proxy [[T1090])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1090/)\nExploit legitimate desktop support and remote access software to establish an\ninteractive C2 channel to target systems within networks (Remote Access Software\n\n[[T1219])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1219/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cryptocurrency Exchange Heists**\n\nIn addition to robbing traditional financial institutions, the BeagleBoyz target\ncryptocurrency exchanges to steal large amounts of cryptocurrency, sometimes valued at\nhundreds of millions of dollars per incident. Cryptocurrency offers the BeagleBoyz an\nirreversible method of theft that can be converted into fiat currency because the\npermanent nature of cryptocurrency transfers do not allow for claw-back mechanisms.\nWorking with U.S. Government partners, CISA, Treasury, FBI, and USCYBERCOM\nidentified COPPERHEDGE as the tool of choice for the BeagleBoyz to exploit\ncryptocurrency exchanges. COPPERHEDGE is a full-featured remote access tool capable\nof running arbitrary commands, performing system reconnaissance, and exfiltrating data.\nFull technical analysis of COPPERHEDGE is available at https://uscert.cisa.gov/northkorea.\n\n### Exfiltration\n\nDuring a cyber operation, the BeagleBoyz need to exfiltrate a variety of data from\ncompromised systems. In addition to the C2 tools noted that have built-in exfiltration\nfeatures, such as CROWDEDFLOUNDER and HOPLIGHT, the BeagleBoyz use the\n[following techniques to steal data from a network (Exfiltration [TA0010]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0010/)\n\nCompress and encrypt collected data before exfiltration to minimize the amount of data\nsent over the web and make it portable, less conspicuous, and less detectable (Archive\n_Collected Data_ [[T1560])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1560/)\nSteal collected data via scripts (although this may require other exfiltration techniques)\n(Automated Exfiltration [[T1020])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1020/)\nEncode data using the same protocol as the C2 channel and exfiltrate it over the C2\nchannel (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel [[T1041])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1041/)\n\n### Impact\n\nThe U.S. Government has observed the BeagleBoyz successfully monetize illicit access to\nfinancial institutions’ SWIFT terminals to enable wire fraud and gain access to the\ninstitutions’ payment switch application servers, which allowed fraudulent ATM cash outs.\nAfter gaining access to either one or both of these operationally critical systems, the\nBeagleBoyz monitor the systems to learn about their configurations and legitimate use\npatterns, and then they deploy bespoke tools to facilitate illicit monetization.\n\nThe cybersecurity community and Financial Services sector have released substantial\ninformation on the BeagleBoyz manipulation of compromised SWIFT terminals, describing\ntheir ability to monitor these systems, send fraudulent messages, and attempt to hide the\nfraudulent activity from detection. The discussion below focuses on the custom tools used to\nmanipulate payment switch applications for ATM cash outs.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe BeagleBoyz use FASTCash malware to intercept financial request messages and reply\nwith fraudulent but legitimate-looking affirmative response messages in the ISO 8583 format.\nThe BeagleBoyz have functionally equivalent FASTCash malware for both UNIX and\nWindows that they deploy depending on the operating system running on the server hosting\nthe bank’s payment switch application.\n\nFASTCash for UNIX is composed of AIX executable files designed to inject code and\nlibraries into a currently running process. One AIX executable provides export functions,\nwhich allows an application to manipulate transactions on financial systems using the ISO\n8583 international standard for financial transaction card-originated interchange messaging.\nThe injected executables interpret financial request messages and construct fraudulent\nfinancial response messages. For more details on FASTCash for UNIX malware, please see\nthe FASTCash report at [https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-275A.](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-275A)\n\nThe BeagleBoyz use FASTCash for Windows to manipulate transactions processed by a\nswitch application running on a Windows box. FASTCash for Windows is also specific to the\nISO 8583 message format. The BeagleBoyz appear to have modified publicly available\nsource code to write parts of the tool, likely to speed development. The malware contains\ncode probably taken from open-source repositories on the internet to create hashmaps and\nhook functions and to parse ISO 8583 messages.\n\nFASTCash for Windows injects itself into software running on a Windows platform. The\nmalware then takes control of the software’s network send and receive functions, allowing it\nto manipulate ISO 8583 messages. The U.S. Government has identified two variants of\nFASTCash for Windows. One variant supports ASCII encoding. The BeagleBoyz appear to\nhave modified the second variant’s message parsing code to support Extended Binary\nCoded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCIDC) encoding. Both ASCII and EBCDIC are\ncharacter encoding formats.\n\nFASTCash for Windows malware uses code from github.com/petewarden/c_hashmap for\nhashmaps, code from Microsoft's Detours Library at github.com/Microsoft/Detours for\nhooking, and code from to parse ISO 8583 messages.\n\nThe malware hooks onto the send and receive function of the switch application so that it can\nprocess inbound request messages as they are received. FASTCash for Windows inspects\nthe inbound message, probably looking for specific account numbers. If the account number\nmatches an expected number, the malware constructs a fraudulent response message. If the\naccount number does not match an expected number, the malware allows the request to\npass through normally. If the malware constructs a fraudulent response message, it then\nsends it back to the acquirer without any further processing by the switch application, leaving\nthe issuer without any awareness of the fraudulent transaction.\n\nFull technical reports for FASTCash and FASTCash for Windows malware are available at\n[https://us-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe BeagleBoyz have used the following techniques to manipulate business and operational\n[processes for monetary or destructive purposes (Impact [TA0040]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0040/)\n\nCorrupt or wipe data storage, data structures, and Master Boot Records (MBR) to\ninterrupt network availability, services, and resources (Disk Wipe: Disk Structure Wipe\n\n[[T1561.002], Data Destruction [T1485])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1561/002)\nEncrypt data on target systems and withhold access to the decryption key until a\nransom is paid, or render data permanently inaccessible if the ransom is not paid (Data\n_Encrypted for Impact_ [[T1486])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1486/)\nStop, disable, or render services unavailable on a system to damage the environment\nor inhibit incident response (Service Stop [[T1489])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1489/)\nInsert, delete, or modify data at rest, in transit, or in use to manipulate outcomes, hide\nactivity, and affect the business process, organizational understanding, and decisionmaking (Data Manipulation: Stored Data Manipulation [[T1565.001], Data Manipulation:](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1565/001/)\n_Transmitted Data Manipulation_ [[T1565.002], Data Manipulation: Runtime Data](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1565/002/)\n_[Manipulation [T1565.003])](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1565/003/)_\n\n### Mitigations\n\nContact law enforcement, CISA, or Treasury immediately regarding any identified\nactivity related to BeagleBoyz.
