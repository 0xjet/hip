Part of](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/c/chessmaster-adds-updated-tools-to-its-arsenal.html)\nthis blog post will discuss the updates and differences we have observed across multiple versions of this backdoor.\n\n**Attack Overview**\n\nThe attack starts with Microsoft Word documents containing a malicious VBA macro being attached to spear phishing emails. Although the\ncontents of the malicious documents are unreadable (see Figure 3), the Japanese titles are related to maritime, diplomatic, and North Korean\nissues. Table 1 shows the UPPERCUT indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n\n**File Name** **MD5** **Size** **C2**\n\n\n-----\n\n自民党海洋総合戦略小委員会が政府に提言申し入れ.doc\n\nGovernment Recommendations from the Liberal Democratic\nParty’s Comprehensive Strategic Maritime Subcommittee\n\nグテマラ大使講演会案内状.doc\n\nInvitation to Lecture by Guatemalan Ambassador\n\n米国接近に揺れる北朝鮮内部.doc\n\nNorth Korean interior swayed by the approach of the United States\n\nTable 1: UPPERCUT IoCs\n\n\n4f83c01e8f7507d23c67ab085bf79e97 843022 eservake.jetos[.]com\n\n82.221.100.52\n\n151.106.53.147\n\nf188936d2c8423cf064d6b8160769f21 720384 eservake.jetos[.]com\n\n151.106.53.147\n\n153.92.210.208\n\ncca227f70a64e1e7fcf5bccdc6cc25dd 733184 eservake.jetos[.]com\n\n153.92.210.208\n\n167.99.121.203\n\n\n[For the North Korean lure, a news article with an identical title was readily available online. It’s also worth noting that in the Guatemalan lure,](https://www.worldtimes.co.jp/column/88334.html)\nthe attacker used an unusual spelling of Guatemala in Japanese. The top result of a Google search using the same spelling led us to the event\nwebsite for the lecture of the Guatemalan Ambassador, held in August 2018. Figure 1 shows the screenshot of the event page.\n\n\nEvent Website for the Lecture of Guatemala Ambassador\n\n\nFigure 1: Event Website for the Lecture of Guatemala\n\nAmbassador\nFigure 2 shows the macro function that displays the lure document. At the bottom of this function, we can see the readable text that matches\nthe contact information found in Figure 1. Thus, people who would have an interest in Latin American issues may have been the targets of this\ncampaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nMacro to display lure document\n\n\nFigure 2: Macro to display lure document\n\nThe initial Word documents were password protected, likely in an effort to bypass detection. Once the password (delivered in the body of the\nemail) is entered, the users are presented with a document that will request users to enable the malicious macro, as shown in Figure 3.\n\n\nLure document\n\n\nFigure 3: Lure document\n\n\nFigure 4 shows what happens when the malicious macro is executed.\n\n\n-----\n\nMacro to install UPPERCUT\n\n\nFigure 4: Macro to install UPPERCUT\n\nThe execution workflow is as follows:\n\n1.   The macro drops three PEM files, padre1.txt, padre2.txt, and padre3.txt, to the victim’s %TEMP% folder and then copies them from\n%TEMP% to the %AllUserProfile% folder.\n\n2.   The macro decodes the dropped files using Windows certutil.exe with the following commands (certutil.exe is a legitimate built-in\ncommand-line program to manage certificates in Windows):\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\" /c certutil -decode C:\\ProgramData\\padre1.txt C:\\ProgramData\\\\GUP.txt\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\" /c certutil -decode C:\\ProgramData\\padre2.txt C:\\ProgramData\\\\libcurl.txt\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\" /c certutil -decode C:\\ProgramData\\padre3.txt C:\\ProgramData\\\\3F2E3AB9\n\n3.   The macro creates a copy of the files with their proper extensions using Extensible Storage Engine Utilities (esentutil.exe) with the\nfollowing commands (esentutil.exe is also a legitimate program that is pre-installed in Windows):\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\esentutl.exe\" /y C:\\ProgramData\\\\GUP.txt /d C:\\ProgramData\\GUP.exe /o\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\esentutl.exe\" /y C:\\ProgramData\\\\libcurl.txt /d C:\\ProgramData\\libcurl.dll /o\n\nThe dropped files include the following:\n\nGUP.exe : GUP, a free (LGPL) Generic Updater. GUP is an open source binary used by Notepad++ for software updates. The version\nused here is version 4.1 digitally signed by Notepad++, as shown in Figure 5.\nlibcurl.dll: Malicious Loader DLL\n3F2E3AB9: Encrypted shellcode\n\n\n-----\n\nNotepad++ signed updater\n\n\nFigure 5: Notepad++ signed updater\n\n4.   The macro launches the legitimate executable GUP.exe.\n\nThe executable sideloads the malicious DLL (libcurl.dll), which decrypts and runs shellcode (3F2E3AB9) located in the same folder.\nThe shellcode decodes and decompresses another DLL, which is an updated variant of UPPERCUT. Before decoding the DLL, the\nshellcode uses an anti-debug technique based on ntdll_NtSetInformationThread which causes the thread to be detached from the\ndebugger, as shown in Figure 6. The DLL is then loaded into memory and the randomly named exported function is called.\n\n\nAnti-debug technique used by shellcode\n\n\nFigure 6: Anti-debug technique used by shellcode\n\n5.   The macro deletes the initially dropped .txt files using Windows esentutl.exe and changes the document text to an embedded message.\n\n\n-----\n\ne co p ete attac o e e s s o gu e\n\n\nAttack overview\n\n\nFigure 7: Attack overview\n\n[Several threat actors leverage the technique of using Windows certutil.exe for](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/targeted-attack-in-middle-east-by-apt34) [payload decoding, and](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2017/79332/) [APT10 continues to employ this](https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/cloud-hopper-annex-b-final.pdf)\ntechnique.\n\n**Evolution of UPPERCUT**\n\nFigure 8 shows the timeline of updates for UPPERCUT. The PE compile time of loaders and the create time of droppers (Word documents) are\nplotted in the graph. The compile time of loaders in the newer version(s) are not shown here since the timestamps are overwritten and filled\nwith zeroes. We don’t have visibility into UPPERCUT 5.2.x series, but it’s possible that minor revisions were released every few months\nbetween December 2017 and May 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nTimeline of UPPERCUT updates\n\n\nFigure 8: Timeline of UPPERCUT updates\n\nUnlike previous versions, the exported function names are randomized in the latest version (Table 2).\n\n**Encoded Payload** **Decoded**\n**Payload**\n\n**MD5** **Size** **Import Hash** **Exported Function** **Version**\n\naa3f303c3319b14b4829fe2faa5999c1 322164 182ee99b4f0803628c30411b1faa9992 l7MF25T96n45qOGWX 5.3.2\n\n126067d634d94c45084cbe1d9873d895 330804 5f45532f947501cf024d84c36e3a19a1 hJvTJcdAU3mNkuvGGq7L 5.4.1\n\nfce54b4886cac5c61eda1e7605483ca3 345812 c1942a0ca397b627019dace26eca78d8 WcuH 5.4.1\n\nTable 2: Static characteristics of UPPERCUT\n\nAnother new feature in the latest UPPERCUT sample is that the malware sends an error code in the Cookie header if it fails to receive the\nHTTP response from the command and control (C2) server. The error code is the value returned by the GetLastError function and sent in the\nnext beacon. This was likely included to help the attackers understand the problem if the backdoor is unable to receive a response (Figure 9).\nThis Cookie header is a unique indicator that can be used for network-based detection.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample of callback\n\n\nFigure 9: Example of callback\n\nEarlier versions of UPPERCUT used the hard-coded string “this is the encrypt key” for Blowfish encryption when communicating with a C2.\nHowever, in the latest version, the keys are hard-coded uniquely for each C2 address and use the C2’s calculated MD5 hash to determine\nwhich key to use, as shown in Figure 10.\n\n\nBlowfish key generation\n\n\nFigure 10: Blowfish key generation\n\nFor instance, Table 3 lists the hard-coded C2 addresses, their MD5 hash, and the corresponding Blowfish key in the decoded payload of\n126067d634d94c45084cbe1d9873d895.\n\n\n-----\n\n**C2** **MD5** **Blowfish Key**\n\nhxxp[:]//151.106.53[.]147/VxQG f613846eb5bed227ec1a5f8df7e678d0 bdc4b9f5af9868e028dd0adc10099a4e6656e9f0ad12b2e75a30f5ca0\n\nhxxp[:]//153.92.210[.]208/wBNh1 50c60f37922ff2ff8733aaeaa9802da5 fb9f7fb3c709373523ff27824ed6a31d800e275ec5217d8a11024a3dff\n\nhxxp[:]//eservake.jetos[.]com/qIDj c500dae1ca41236830b59f1467ee96c1 d3450966ceb2eba93282aace7d7684380d87c6621bbd3c4f621caa0\n\nDefault Default f12df6984bb65d18e2561bd017df29ee1cf946efa5e510802005aeee9\n\nTable 3: Example of Blowfish keys\n\nIn this example, the MD5 hash of hxxp[:]//151.106.53[.]147/VxQG will be f613846eb5bed227ec1a5f8df7e678d0. When the malware interacts\nwith this URL, bdc4b9f5af9868e028dd0adc10099a4e6656e9f0ad12b2e75a30f5ca0e34489d will be selected as a Blowfish key. If the MD5\nhash of the URL does not match any of the listed hashes, then the default key\nf12df6984bb65d18e2561bd017df29ee1cf946efa5e510802005aeee9035dd53 will be used.\n\nAnother difference in the network traffic generated from the malware is that the encoded proxy information has been added in the URL query\nvalues during the C2 communication. Table 4 shows the parameters sent to C2 server from the backdoor in the newer versions. These are\nsent via POST request, as shown in Figure 9.\n\n\nURL parameters\n\n\nTable 4: URL parameters\n\nAdditionally, the command string is hashed using the same RGPH hashing algorithm as before. Two more commands,\n0xD290626C85FB1CE3 and 0x409C7A89CFF0A727, are supported in the newer versions (Table 5).\n\n**Commands** **Description**\n\n0x97A168D9697D40DD Download and validate file (XXHash comparison) from C2 server\n\n0x7CF812296CCC68D5 Upload file to C2 server\n\n0x652CB1CEFF1C0A00 Load PE file\n\n\n-----\n\n0x27595F1F74B55278 Download, validate (XXHash comparison), execute file, and send output to C2 server\n\n0xD290626C85FB1CE3 Format the current timestamp\n\n0x409C7A89CFF0A727 Capture the desktop screenshot in PNG format and send it to C2\n\nNone of the above The received buffer is executed via cmd.exe and the output is then sent to the C2 server\n\nTable 5: Supported commands\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile APT10 consistently targets the same geolocation and industry, the malware they use is actively evolving. In the newer versions of\nUPPERCUT, there is a significant change in the way backdoor initializes the Blowfish encryption key, which makes it harder for analysts to\ndetect and decrypt the backdoor’s network communications. This shows that APT10 is very capable of maintaining and updating their\nmalware.\n\nTo mitigate the threat, users are advised to disable Office macros in their settings and not to open documents from unknown sources. FireEye\nMulti-Vector Execution (MVX) engine is able to recognize and block this threat with the following detection names:\n\nAPT.Backdoor.Win.UPPERCUT\nFE_APT_Backdoor_Win32_UPPERCUT\n\n\n-----",
