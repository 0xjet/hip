Initial victims have been identified in several sectors, including information\ntechnology, energy, healthcare and public health, communications, and critical manufacturing.\n\nAccording to preliminary analysis, threat actors appear to be leveraging stolen administrative\ncredentials (local and domain) and certificates, along with placing sophisticated malware\nimplants on critical systems. Some of the campaign victims have been IT service providers,\nwhere credential compromises could potentially be leveraged to access customer environments.\nDepending on the defensive mitigations in place, the threat actor could possibly gain full access\nto networks and data in a way that appears legitimate to existing monitoring tools.\n\nAlthough this activity is still under investigation, NCCIC is sharing this information to provide\norganizations information for the detection of potential compromises within their organizations.\n\nNCCIC will update this document as information becomes available.\n\nTo report activity related to this Incident Report Alert, please contact NCCIC at\n[NCCICCustomerService@hq.dhs.gov or 1-888-282-0870.](mailto:NCCICCustomerService@hq.dhs.gov)\n\n1 of 20 **TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\n# Risk Evaluation\n\n\n**NCCIC Cyber Incident Scoring System (NCISS) Rating Priority Level (Color)**\n\n\nYellow (Medium)\n\n\nA medium priority incident may affect public health or safety, national security, economic security,\nforeign relations, civil liberties, or public confidence.\n\n\n# Details\n\nWhile NCCIC continues to work with a variety of victims across different sectors, the\nadversaries in this campaign continue to affect several IT service providers. To achieve\noperational efficiencies and effectiveness, many IT service providers often leverage common\ncore infrastructure that should be logically isolated to support multiple clients.\n\nIntrusions into these providers create opportunities for the adversary to leverage stolen\ncredentials to access customer environments within the provider network. Figure 1: Structure of a traditional business network and an IT service provider network. The Traditional Business Network section displays a horizontal flow diagram. The Company A - Business Network diagram flows from left to right in the following order: Workstation, VPN, Web Servers, Business Servers, E-Mail Server, External Router, and Internet. The IT Service Provider Network also flows from left to right. The Company B diagram is as follows: Workstations, External Router, Internet, and IT Service Provider. The IT Service Provider branches off into 4 separate sub-sections; Company B Space, Company C Space, Company D Space, and Company E Space contain similar flow diagrams displaying VPN, Web-Servers, Business Servers, and E-Mail Server.\n\nFigure 1: Structure of a traditional business network and an IT service provider network\n\n2 of 20 **TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\n# Technical Analysis\n\nThe threat actors in this campaign have been observed employing a variety of tactics, techniques,\nand procedures (TTPs). The actors use malware implants to acquire legitimate credentials then\nleverage those credentials to pivot throughout the local environment. NCCIC is aware of several\ncompromises involving the exploitation of system administrators’ credentials to access trusted\ndomains as well as the malicious use of certificates. Additionally, the adversary makes heavy use\nof PowerShell and the open source PowerSploit tool to enable assessment, reconnaissance, and\nlateral movement.\n\nCommand and Control (C2) primarily occurs using RC4 cipher communications over port 443 to\ndomains that change IP addresses. Many of these domains spoof legitimate sites and content,\nwith a particular focus on spoofing Windows update sites. Most of the known domains leverage\ndynamic DNS services, and this pattern adds to the complexity of tracking this activity. Listings\nof observed domains are found in this document’s associated [STIX package](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/IR-ALERT-MED-17-093-01C.stix.xml) [and .xlsx file. The](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/IR-ALERT-MED-17-093-01C.xlsx)\nindicators should be used to observe potential malicious activity on your network.\n\nUser impersonation via compromised credentials is the primary mechanism used by the\nadversary. However, a secondary technique to maintain persistence and provide additional access\ninto the victim network is the use of malware implants left behind on key relay and staging\nmachines. In some instances, the malware has only been found within memory with no on-disk\nevidence available for examination. To date, the actors have deployed multiple malware families\nand variants, some of which are currently not detected by anti-virus signatures. The observed\nmalware includes PLUGX/SOGU and REDLEAVES. Although the observed malware is based\non existing malware code, the actors have modified it to improve effectiveness and avoid\ndetection by existing signatures.\n\nBoth REDLEAVES and PLUGX have been observed being executed on systems via dynamiclink library (DLL) side-loading. The DLL side-loading technique utilized by these malware\nfamilies typically involves three files: a non-malicious executable, a malicious DLL loader, and\nan encoded payload file. The malicious DLL is named as one of the DLLs that the executable\nwould normally load and is responsible for decoding and executing the payload into memory.\n\n## REDLEAVES Malware \n\nThe most unique implant observed in this campaign is the REDLEAVES malware. The\nREDLEAVES implant consists of three parts: an executable, a loader, and the implant shellcode.\nThe REDLEAVES implant is a remote administration Trojan (RAT) that is built in Visual C++\nand makes heavy use of thread generation during its execution. The implant contains a number of\nfunctions typical of RATs, including system enumeration and creating a remote shell back to the\nC2.\n\n3 of 20 **TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Capabilities_**\n\n**System Enumeration. The implant is capable of enumerating the following information about**\nthe victim system and passing it back to the C2:\n\n  - system name,\n\n  - system architecture (x86 or x64),\n\n  - operating system major and minor versions,\n\n  - amount of available memory,\n\n  - processor specifications,\n\n  - language of the user,\n\n  - privileges of the current process,\n\n  - group permissions of the current user,\n\n  - system uptime,\n\n  - IP address, and\n\n  - primary drive storage utilization.\n\n**Command Execution. The implant can execute a command directly inside a command shell**\nusing native Windows functionality by passing the command to run to cmd.exe with the “/c”\noption (“cmd.exe /c <command>”).\n\n**Command Window Generation. The implant can also execute commands via a remote shell**\nthat is generated and passed through a named pipe. A command window is piped back to the C2\nover the network as a remote shell or alternatively to another process or thread that can\ncommunicate with that pipe. The implant uses the mutexRedLeavesCMDSimulatorMutex.\n\n**File System Enumeration. The implant has the ability to enumerate data within a specified**\ndirectory, where it gathers filenames, last file write times, and file sizes.\n\n**Network Traffic Compression and Encryption. The implant uses a form of LZO compression**\nto compress data that is sent to its C2. After compression, the data for this implant sample is then\nRC4-ciphered with the key 0x6A6F686E3132333400 (this corresponds to the string “john1234”\nwith the null byte appended).\n\nNetwork Communications REDLEAVES connects to the C2 over TCP port 443, but does not\nuse the secure flag when calling the API function InternetOpenUrlW. The data is not encrypted\nand there is no SSL handshake as would normally occur with port 443 traffic, but rather the data\nis transmitted in the form that is generated by the RC4 cipher.\nCurrent REDLEAVES samples that have been examined have a hard-coded C2. Inside the\nimplant’s configuration block in memory were the strings in Table 1.\n\n4 of 20 **TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 1: REDLEAVES Sample Strings Found in C2\n\n\nQN4869MD – mutex used to determine if the implant is already running (Varies from sample to sample)\n2016-5-1-INCO –Unknown\n%windir.\\system32\\svchost.exe - process that the implant was injected into\njohn1234 (with the null byte afterward) – RC4 Key\n\n\nWhile the name of the initial mutex, QN4869MD in this sample, varies among REDLEAVES\nsamples, the RedLeavesCMDSimulatorMutex mutex name appears to be consistent. Table 2\ncontains a sample of the implant communications to the domain windowsupdates.dnset[.]com\nover TCP port 443.\n\nTable 2: REDLEAVES Sample Beacon\n\n\n--- BEGIN SAMPLE BEACON --00000000 c1 0c 00 00 7a 8d 9b dc 88 00 00 00 ....z... ....\n0000000C 14 6f 68 6e 16 6f 68 6e c4 a4 b1 d1 c4 e6 24 eb .ohn.ohn ......$.\n0000001C cf 49 81 a7 a1 c7 96 ff 6d 31 b4 48 8b 3e a3 c1 .I...... m1.H.>..\n0000002C 92 e2 c3 7c e4 4c cf e9 e1 fa fb 6a fa 66 2c bf ...|.L.. ...j.f,.\n0000004C 7b 13 a7 30 17 3d eb fb d3 16 0e 96 83 21 2e 73 {..0.=.. .....!.s\n0000005C dc 44 a2 72 fb f4 5e d0 4d b7 85 be 33 cd 13 21 .D.r..^.

The first header comes in its own packet, with the second header\nand the payload following in a separate packet within the same TCP stream. The last four bytes\nof the first header contain the number of the remaining bytes in little-endian format (0x88 in the\nsample beacon above).\nThe second header, starting at position 0x0C, is XOR’d with the first four bytes of the key that is\nused to encrypt the payload. In the case of this sample, those first four bytes would be “john” (or\n0x6a6f686e using the ASCII hex codes). After the XOR operation, the bytes in positions 0x0C\nthrough 0x0F contain the length of the decrypted and decompressed payload. The bytes in\npositions 0x10 through 0x13 contain the length of the encrypted and compressed payload.\n\nTo demonstrate, in the sample beacon, the second header follows:\n\n0000000C 14 6f 68 6e 16 6f 68 6e c4 a4 b1 d1\n\nThe length of the decrypted and decompressed payload is 0x7e000000 in little-endian format\n(0x146f686e XOR 0x6a6f686e). The length of the encrypted and compressed payload is\n\n5 of 20 **TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\n0x7c000000 in little-endian (0x166f686e XOR 0x6a6f686e). This is verified by referring back to\nthe sample beacon which had the number of remaining bytes set to 0x88 and subtracting the\nlength of the second header (0x88 – 0xC = 0x7c).\n\n**_Strings_**\n\n_Note: Use caution when searching based on strings, as common strings may cause a large_\n_number of false positives._\n\nTable 3: Strings Appearing in the Analyzed Sample of REDLEAVES\n\n\n\n[ Unique Ascii strings ] -------------------red_autumnal_leaves_dllmain.dll\nwindowsupdates.dnset.com windowsupdates.dnset.com\nwindowsupdates.dnset.com\n2016-5-10-INCO\njohn1234\nFeb 04 2015\n127.0.0.1 169.254\ntcp\nhttps\nhttp\n\n[ Unique Unicode strings ] -----------------RedLeavesCMDSimulatorMutex\nQN4869MD\n\\\\\\\\.\\\\pipe\\\\NamePipe_MoreWindows\nnetwork.proxy.type\nnetwork.proxy.http_port\nnetwork.proxy.http network.proxy.autoconfig_url\nnetwork.proxy.\na([a-zA-Z0-9])\nb([ \\\\t])\nc([a-zA-Z])\nd([0-9])\nh([0-9a-fA-F])\nn(\\r|(\\r?\\n)) q(\\\"[^\\\"]*\\\")|('[^']*')\nw([a-zA-Z]+)\nz([0-9]+)\n\n\n6 of 20 **TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Malware Execution Analysis_**\n\n**File Name: VeetlePlayer.exe**\n**MD5: 9d0da088d2bb135611b5450554c99672**\n**File Size: 25704 bytes (25.1 KB)**\n**Description: This is the executable that calls the exports located within libvlc.dll**\n\n**File Name: libvlc.dll**\n**MD5: 9A8C76271210324D97A232974CA0A6A3**\n**File Size: 33792 bytes (33.0 KB)**\n**Description: This is the loader and decoder for mtcReport.ktc, the combined shellcode and**\nimplant file.\n\n**File Name: mtcReport.ktc**\n**MD5: 3045E77E1E9CF9D9657AEA71AB5E8947**\n**File Size: 231076 bytes (225.7 KB)**\n**Description: This is the encoded shellcode and implant file. When this file is decoded, the**\nshellcode precedes the actual implant, which resides at offset 0x1292 from the beginning of the\nshellcode in memory. The implant has the MZ and PE flags replaced with the value 0xFF.\n\nAll three of these files must be present for execution of the malware to succeed.\n\nWhen all files are present and the VeetlePlayer.exe file is executed, it will make calls to the\nfollowing DLL exports within the libvlc.dll file:\n\n  - VLC_Version checks to see if its calling file is named “VeetlePlayer.exe”. If the calling\n\nfile is named something else, execution will terminate and no shellcode will be loaded.\n\n  - VLC_Create reads in the contents of the file mtcReport.ktc.\n\n  - VLC_Init takes in the offset in which the encoded shellcode/implant file is located and\n\ndeobfuscates it. After deobfuscation, this export executes the shellcode.\n\n  - VLC_Destroy does nothing other than perform a return 0.\n\n  - VLC_AddIntf and VLC_CleanUp simply call the export VLC_Destroy, which returns 0.\n\nWhen the libvlc.dll decodes the shellcode/implant, it calls the shellcode at the beginning of the\ndata blob in memory. The shellcode then activates a new instance of svchost.exe and suspends it.\nIt then makes a call to WriteProcessMemory() and inserts the implant with the damaged MZ and\nPE headers into its memory space. It then resumes execution of svchost.exe, which runs the\nimplant.\n\nThe resulting decoded shellcode with the implant file below it can have a variable MD5 based on\nhow it is dumped from memory. The MD5 checksums of two instances of decoded shellcode are:\n\n7 of 20 **TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\n1. ba4b4087370780dc988d55cbb9de885d\n2. 3d032ba5f73cbc398f1a77af92077cd8\n\nTable 4 contains the implant resulting from the original implant’s separation from the shellcode\nand the repair of its MZ and PE flags.\n\nTable 4: Resulting Implant from Shellcode Separation\n\n**File Name: red_autumnal_leaves_dllmain.dll**\n**MD5: 3EBBFEEE3A832C92BB60B531F749230E**\n**File Size: 226304 bytes (221.0 KB)**\n**PE Compile Date: 10 May 2016**\nDuring execution, the file will create two mutexes called RedLeavesCMDSimulatorMutex and\nQN4869MD. It checks the QN4869MD mutex to see if it is already running. It will then perform initial\nenumeration of the system to include operating system versions, number of processors, RAM, and CPU\ninformation.\n\n**_PLUGX_**\n\nPLUGX is a sophisticated Remote Access Tool (RAT) operating since approximately 2012.\nAlthough there are now many variants of this RAT in existence today, there are still\ncharacteristics common to most variants.\n\nTypically, PLUGX uses three components to install itself.\n\n1. A non-malicious executable\n2. A malicious DLL/installer\n3. An encoded payload – the PLUGX RAT.\n\nA non-malicious executable with one or more imports is used to start the installation process.\nThe executable will likely exist in a directory not normally associated with its use. In some cases,\nthe actor may use an executable signed with a valid certificate, and rename the DLL and encoded\npayload with file names that suggest they are related to the trusted file. Importantly, the actor\nseems to vary the encoding scheme used to protect the encoded payload to stifle techniques used\nby AV vendors to develop patterns to detect it. The payload is either encoded with a single byte\nor encrypted and decompressed. Recently, NCCIC has observed a case where the encoded\npayload contains a decoding stub within itself, beginning at byte zero. The malware simply reads\nthis payload and executes it starting at byte zero. The stub then decodes and executes the rest of\nitself in memory. Notably, this stub varies in its structure and algorithm, again stifling detection\nby signature based security software. The PLUGX malware is never stored on disk in an\nunencrypted or decoded format.\n\nWhen the initial executable is launched, the imported library, usually a separate DLL, is replaced\nwith a malicious version that in turn decodes and installs the third and final component, which is\n\n8 of 20 **TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nthe PLUGX rat itself. Typically, the PLUGX component is obfuscated and contains no visible\nexecutable code until it is unpacked in memory, protecting it from AV/YARA scans while static.\nDuring the evolution of these PLUGX compromises, NCCIC noted an increasing implementation\nof protections of the actual decoded PLUGX in memory. For example, the most recent version\nwe looked at implements a secure strings method, which hides the majority of the common\ncommands used by PLUGX. This is an additional feature designed to thwart signature based\nsecurity tools.\n\nOnce the PLUGX RAT is installed on the victim, the actors has complete C2 capabilities of the\nvictim system, including the ability to take screenshots and download files from the\ncompromised system. The communications between the RAT (installed on the victim system)\nand the PLUGX C2 server are encoded to secure the communication and stifle detection by\nsignature based network signature tools.\n\nThe advanced capabilities of PLUGX are implemented via a plugin framework. Each plugin\noperates independently in its own unique thread within the service. The modules may vary based\non variants. Table 5 lists the modules and capabilities contained within one sample recently\nanalyzed by NCCIC.\n\nTable 5: Modules and Capabilities of PLUGX\n\n**Module Name** **Capability**\n\nDisk wide range of system-related capabilities including file / directory / drive\nenumeration, file / directory creation, create process, and obtain environment\nvariables\n\nKeylog logs keystrokes and saves data to log file\n\nNethood enumerates the host's network resources via the Windows multiple provider router\nDLL\n\nNetstat set the state of a TCP connection or obtain the extended TCP or UDP tables (lists\nof network endpoints available to a process) of each active process on the host\n\nOption provides the ability to initiate a system shutdown, adjust shutdown-related\nprivileges for a given process, and lock the user's workstation\n\nPortmap port mapping\n\nProcess process enumeration, termination, and capability to obtain more in-depth\ninformation pertaining to each process (e.g. CompanyName, FileDescription,\nFileVersion of each module loaded by the process)\n\nRegedit create, read, update & delete registry entries\n\nScreen capability to capture screenshots of the system\n\nService start, stop, remove, configure & query services\n\nShell remote shell access\n\nSQL enumerate SQL databases and available drivers; execute SQL queries\n\n9 of 20 **TLP:WHITE**\n\n|Module Name|Capability|\n|---|---|\n|Disk|wide range of system-related capabilities including file / directory / drive enumeration, file / directory creation, create process, and obtain environment variables|\n|Keylog|logs keystrokes and saves data to log file|\n|Nethood|enumerates the host's network resources via the Windows multiple provider router DLL|\n|Netstat|set the state of a TCP connection or obtain the extended TCP or UDP tables (lists of network endpoints available to a process) of each active process on the host|\n|Option|provides the ability to initiate a system shutdown, adjust shutdown-related privileges for a given process, and lock the user's workstation|\n|Portmap|port mapping|\n|Process|process enumeration, termination, and capability to obtain more in-depth information pertaining to each process (e.g. CompanyName, FileDescription, FileVersion of each module loaded by the process)|\n|Regedit|create, read, update & delete registry entries|\n|Screen|capability to capture screenshots of the system|\n|Service|start, stop, remove, configure & query services|\n|Shell|remote shell access|\n|SQL|enumerate SQL databases and available drivers; execute SQL queries|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Module Name|Capability|\n|---|---|\n|Telnet|provides a telnet interface|\n\n\nThe PLUGX operator may dynamically add, remove, or update PLUGX plugins during runtime.\nThis provides the ability to dynamically adjust C2 capabilities based on the requirements of the\nC2 operator.\n\nNetwork activity is often seen as POST requests similar to that shown in table 6. Network\ndefenders can look to detect non-SSL HTTP traffic on port 443, which can be indicative of\nmalware traffic. The PLUGX malware is also seen using TCP ports 80, 8080, and 53.\n\nTable 6: Sample PLUGX Beacon\n\n\nPOST /D15DB9E25ADA34EC9E559736 HTTP/1.1\n\nAccept: */*\nHX1: 0\nHX2: 0\nHX3: 61456\nHX4: 1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727;\n.NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)\nHost: sc.weboot.info:443\nContent-Length: 0\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n\nEven though the beacon went to port 443, which is commonly used for encrypted HTTP\ncommunications, this traffic was plaintext HTTP, as is common for this variant of PLUGX.\n\n**_For IT Service Providers_**\n\nAll organizations that provide IT services as a commodity for other organizations should\nevaluate their infrastructure to determine if related activity has taken place.

In addition, tools like System Internals\nPSEXEC will mount the shares automatically for the user. Since administrators may map\n\n14 of 20 **TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nadministrative shares legitimately while managing components of the network, this must be\ntaken into account.\n\n - Filter network traffic for SMB mapping events and group the events by source IP,\ndestination IP, the mounted path (providing a count of total mounts to that path), the first\nmap time, and the last map time\n\n - Collect Windows Event Logs – Event ID 5140 (network share object was accessed) can be\nused to track C$ and ADMIN$ mounts by searching the Share Name field\n\n**VPN User authentication mismatch: A VPN user authentication match occurs when a user**\naccount authenticates to an IP address but once connected the internal IP address requests\nauthentication tokens for other users. This may create false positives for legitimate network\nadministrators but if this is detected, organizations should verify that the administrative accounts\nwere legitimately used.\n\n**VPN activity from VPS providers: While this may also produce false positives, VPN logins**\nfrom Virtual Private Server (VPS) providers may be an indicator of VPN users attempting to\nhide their source IP and should be investigated.\n\n## Mitigations\n\nProperly implemented defensive techniques and programs make it more difficult for an adversary\nto gain access to a network and remain persistent yet undetected. When an effective defensive\nprogram is in place, actors should encounter complex defensive barriers. Actor activity should\nalso trigger detection and prevention mechanisms that enable organizations to contain and\nrespond to the intrusion more rapidly. There is no single or set of defensive techniques or\nprograms that will completely avert all malicious activities. Multiple defensive techniques and\nprograms should be adopted and implemented in a layered approach to provide a complex barrier\nto entry, increase the likelihood of detection, and decrease the likelihood of a successful\ncompromise. This layered mitigation approach is known as defense-in-depth.\n\nNCCIC mitigations and recommendations are based on observations made during the hunt,\nanalysis, and network monitoring for threat actor activity, combined with client interaction.\n\n**_Whitelisting_**\n\n  - Enable application directory whitelisting through Microsoft Software Restriction Policy\n(SRP) or AppLocker;\n\n  - Use directory whitelisting rather than trying to list every possible permutation of\napplications in an environment. Safe defaults allow applications to run from\nPROGRAMFILES, PROGRAMFILES(X86), and SYSTEM32. All other locations\n\n15 of 20 **TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\nshould be disallowed unless an exception is granted.\n\n  - Prevent the execution of unauthorized software by using application whitelisting as part\nof the security hardening of operating systems insulating.\n\n  - Enable application directory whitelisting via the Microsoft SRP or AppLocker.\n\n**_Account Control_**\n\n  - Decrease a threat actor’s ability to access key network resources by implementing the\nprinciple of least privilege.\n\n  - Limit the ability of a local administrator account to login from a local interactive session\n(e.g., “Deny access to this computer from the network”) and prevent access via a Remote\nDesktop Protocol session.\n\n  - Remove unnecessary accounts, groups, and restrict root access.\n\n  - Control and limit local administration.\n\n  - Make use of the Protected Users Active Directory group in Windows Domains to further\nsecure privileged user accounts against pass-the-hash compromises.\n\n**_Workstation Management_**\n\n  - Create a secure system baseline image and deploy to all workstations.\n\n  - Mitigate potential exploitation by threat actors by following a normal patching cycle for\nall operating systems, applications, software, and all third-party software.\n\n  - Apply asset and patch management processes.\n\n  - Reduce the number of cached credentials to one if a laptop, or zero if a desktop or fixed\nasset.\n\n**_Host Based Intrusion Detection_**\n\n  - Configure and monitor system logs through host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS)\nand firewall.\n\n  - Deploy an anti-malware solution to prevent spyware, adware, and malware as part of the\noperating system security baseline.\n\n  - Monitor antivirus scan results on a regular basis.\n\n**_Server Management_**\n\n  - Create a secure system baseline image, and deploy to all servers.\n\n  - Upgrade or decommission end-of-life non Windows servers.\n\n  - Upgrade or decommission servers running Windows Server 2003 and older versions.\n\n  - Implement asset and patch management processes.\n\n  - Audit for and disable unnecessary services.\n\n16 of 20 **TLP:WHITE**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Server Configuration and Logging_**\n\n  - Establish remote server logging and retention.\n\n  - Reduce the number of cached credentials to zero.\n\n  - Configure and monitor system logs via a centralized security information and event\nmanagement (SIEM) appliance.\n\n  - Add an explicit DENY for “%USERPROFILE%”.\n\n  - Restrict egress web traffic from servers.\n\n  - In Windows environments, utilize Restricted Admin mode or remote credential guard to\nfurther secure remote desktop sessions against pass-the-hash compromises.\n\n  - Restrict anonymous shares.\n\n  - Limit remote access by only using jump servers for such access.\n\n**_Change Control_**\n\n  - Create a change control process for all implemented changes.\n\n**_Network Security_**\n\n  - An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) should:\n\n`o` Implement continuous monitoring.\n`o` Send alerts to a SIEM tool.\n`o` Monitor internal activity (this tool may use the same tap points as the netflow\ngeneration tools).\n\n  - Netflow Capture should:\n\n`o` Set a minimum retention period of 180 days.\n`o` Capture netflow on all ingress and egress points of network segments, not just at\nthe Managed Trusted Internet Protocol Services (MTIPS) or Trusted Internet\nConnections (TIC) locations.\n\n  - Network Packet Capture (PCAP):\n\n`o` Retain PCAP data for a minimum of 24 hours.\n`o` Capture traffic on all ingress and egress points of the network.\n\n  - Use a virtual private network (VPN):\n\n`o` Maintain site-to-site VPN with customers.\n`o` Authenticate users utilizing site-to-site VPNs through adaptive security appliance\n(ASA).\n\n  - Use authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for controlling network\naccess.\n`o` Require Personal Identity Verification (PIV) authentication to an HTTPS page on\nthe ASA in order to control access.
