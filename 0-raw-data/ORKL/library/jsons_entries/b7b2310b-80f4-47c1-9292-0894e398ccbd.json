The command and control server has been taken down, and the_\n_infected devices are no longer under the control of the attackers._\n\nMany of the malware campaigns we have detected over the last year have been global at\nscale, targeting anyone with little regard to their location. Recently, we discovered and\nbegan monitoring the activity behind PhoneSpy, a spyware aimed at South Korean\nresidents with Android devices. With more than a thousand South Korean victims, the\nmalicious group behind this invasive campaign has had access to all the data,\ncommunications, and services on their devices.\n\nUnlike other spyware campaigns we have covered that take advantage of vulnerabilities on\nthe device, PhoneSpy hides in plain sight, disguising itself as a regular application with\npurposes ranging from learning Yoga to watching TV and videos, or browsing photos. But in\nreality, the application is stealing data, messages, images, and remote control of Android\n\n\n-----\n\nphones. The data stolen from victim devices ranged from personal photos to corporate\ncommunications. The victims were broadcasting their private information to the malicious\nactors with zero indication that something was amiss.\n\nWhile the victims have been limited to South Korea, PhoneSpy is an example of how\nmalicious applications can disguise their true intent. When installed on victims’ devices,\nthey leave personal and corporate data at risk. With mobile devices playing critical roles in\ndistributed and remote work, it is no surprise that spyware campaigns like PhoneSpy are on\nthe rise.\n\nSamples of PhoneSpy were not found in any Android app store, indicating that attackers\nare using distribution methods based on web traffic redirection or social engineering.\n\nOnce in control, the attackers can access the camera to take pictures, record video, and\naudio, get precise GPS location, view pictures from the device, and more.\n\nZimperium zLabs identified the PhoneSpy spyware app during routine threat research, and\nthe zLabs team launched an investigation after identifying multiple related malicious\napplications.\n\n**_Disclosure: Due to the nature of this spyware campaign, Zimperium has notified and_**\n_submitted all relevant threat data to US and South Korean authorities. The Zimperium_\n_team also reported to the host of the command and control server multiple times,_\n_offering support in a takedown of the malicious services. At the time of this writing, the_\n_PhoneSpy spyware campaign is still active._\n\nIn this blog, we will:\n\nCover the capabilities of the Android spyware;\nDiscuss the techniques used to collect and store data; and\nShow the communication with the C&C server to exfiltrate stolen data.\n\n## What Can PhoneSpy Spyware Do?\n\nThe mobile application poses a threat to Android devices by functioning as an advanced\nRemote Access Trojan (RAT) that receives and executes commands to collect and exfiltrate\na wide variety of data and perform a wide range of malicious actions, such as:\n\nComplete list of the installed applications\nSteal credentials using phishing\nSteal images\nMonitoring the GPS location\nSteal SMS messages\nSteal phone contacts\nSteal call logs\n\n\n-----\n\nRecord audio in real-time\nRecord video in real-time using front & rear cameras\nAccess camera to take photos using front & rear cameras\nSend SMS to attacker-controlled phone number with attacker-controlled text\nExfiltrate device information (IMEI, Brand, device name, Android version)\nConceal its presence by hiding the icon from the device’s drawer/menu\n\nUpon infection, the victim’s mobile device will transmit accurate GPS locational data, share\nphotos and communications, contact lists, and downloaded documents with the command\nand control server. Similar to other mobile spyware we have seen, the data stolen from\nthese devices could be used for personal and corporate blackmail and espionage. The\nmalicious actors could then produce notes on the victim, download any stolen materials,\nand gather intelligence for other nefarious practices.\n\n## How Does PhoneSpy Spyware Work?\n\nThe PhoneSpy spyware disguises itself as various lifestyle apps targeting Korean-speaking\nusers. It is most likely distributed through web traffic redirection or social engineering as it\nhas not been detected in Android stores, including third-party or regional stores. After\ninstallation, the application requests permissions and opens a phishing page that imitates\nthe login page of the popular South Korean messaging app “Kakao Talk” to steal\ncredentials.\n\nThe application follows the typical behavior of spyware by asking for permissions to\nexercise its capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_Figures.1,2: The list of permissions requested by one of the applications_**\n\nAfter installation and launch, the app displays a login page and attempts to steal the\ncredentials for “Kakao” which can be used to login into other services in South Korea with\nthe Single-Sign-On feature.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figures.3-5: The phishing pages hosted by the threat actors_**\n\nIn most of the discovered applications, the application’s user/victim interaction is limited to\nthe above sign-on, only to receive an error message. Many of the applications are facades\nof a real app with none of the advertised user-based functionality. In a few other cases, like\nsimpler apps that advertise as photo viewers, the app will work as advertised all while the\nPhoneSpy spyware is working in the background.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure.6: Dynamic loading of content from the remote server_**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_Figures.7-10: The fake gallery website displayed by the app & the files hosted on it_**\n\nWhile these actions are taking place in the foreground, the spyware abuses its permissions\nand acts as a Remote Access Trojan, leaving the device open to access for the threat\nactors. The spyware makes sure to avoid data redundancy by only uploading the latest data\ncreated after the last upload, as seen in Figure.11.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure.11: SMS data collection and exfiltration to the C&C server_**\n\nThe command and control server stores all the exfiltrated data and maintains a\ncommunication channel with the infected devices to send commands.\n\nThe table of commands and the corresponding actions are shown in Table.1.\n\n**Command** **Action**\n\n0 Upload phone information such as Phone.No, IMEI, Android version, and\nModel Name\n\n1 Upload the entire contacts list\n\n\n-----\n\n2 Delete a contact matching by phone number\n\n3 Upload all the SMS stored in the device\n\n4 Upload the latest call logs since the last upload\n\n5 Upload all the photos from the sdcard\n\n6 Upload all the videos from the sdcard\n\n7 Get real-time GPS location\n\n8 Send an SMS to a phone number with content, both as directed by the C&C\nserver\n\n9 Take photos using the Front Camera & upload them to the C&C server\n\n10 Take photos using the Rear Camera & upload them to the C&C server\n\n11 Real-time video streaming using the Front camera\n\n12 Real-time video streaming using the Rear camera\n\n13 Set the duration for real-time audio recording\n\n14 Upload the recorded audio files\n\n16 Add call forwarding\n\n17 Remove call forwarding\n\n18 Update call forwarding\n\n21 Remove blocklisting of a phone number as directed by the C&C server\n\n22 Add blocklisting of a phone number as directed by the C&C server\n\n24 Collect the list of installed applications, including the icon, app version,\npackage name, and update date.\n\n25 Uninstall an application matching by package name\n\n28 Download an apk from the link sent by the C&C server and install the\napplication as an update\n\n30 Insert contact with name and phone number as directed by the C&C server\n\n31 Delete all the SMS stored in the infected device\n\n32 Delete all call logs stored in the infected device\n\n\n-----\n\n33 Open a URL sent by the C&C server used for harvesting credentials\nthrough phishing.\n\n**_Table.1: Supported commands and associated actions_**\n\nThe command and control server has a web-based interface and is protected by an\nauthentication mechanism using credentials, as seen in Figure.12.\n\n**_Figure.12: The login panel of the C&C server_**\n\nThe application is capable of uninstalling any user-installed applications, including mobile\nsecurity apps. The device’s precise location is available in real-time to the malicious actors,\nall without the victim knowing. The spyware also enables the threat actor to use phishing\npages for harvesting credentials of Facebook, Instagram, Google, and Kakao Talk, just like\nthe phishing pages shown in Figures.13-15. The threat actor uses the command “33” to\nsend a phishing URL to the device, and PhoneSpy loads the page. Any credentials typed\ninto the forms are sent back to the command and control server.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure.16: A collection of icons of some of the spyware applications_**\n\n## The Victims of the PhoneSpy Spyware Campaign\n\nThe Zimperium zLabs mobile threat research team identified 23 applications targeting\nSouth Korean citizens to date, infecting thousands of victims to this spyware campaign.\nThese malicious Android apps are designed to run silently in the background, constantly\nspying on their victims without raising any suspicion. We believe the malicious actors\nresponsible for PhoneSpy have gathered significant amounts of personal and corporate\ninformation on their victims, including private communications and photos.\n\nEven though thousands of South Korean victims have fallen prey to the spyware campaign,\nit is unclear whether they have any connections with each other. But with the ability to\ndownload contact lists and send SMS messages on behalf of the victim, there is a high\n\n\n-----\n\nchance that the malicious actors are targeting connections of current victims with phishing\nlinks.\n\n**_Figure.17: The victimology map_**\n\n## Zimperium vs. PhoneSpy Spyware\n\nZimperium zIPS customers are protected against PhoneSpy with our on-device z9 Mobile\nThreat Defense machine learning engine.\n\nZimperium on-device phishing classifiers detect the traffic from the domain\n_https[:]//acd.kcpro.ga as malicious from inception with our machine learning-based_\ntechnology, blocking all traffic to it and preventing attackers from taking effective control of\nany compromised devices.\n\nAll the compromised and malicious applications found were also reviewed using\nZimperium’s app analysis platform, z3A. All these apps returned reports of high privacy and\nsecurity risks to the end-user. Zimperium administrators can create risk policies preventing\nusers from installing high-risk apps like PhoneSpy.\n\nKey privacy risks identified by our z3A service analysis PhoneSpy infected apps are:\n\nAccess to SMS messages, camera, call logs, contacts, and location, among others.\nThe capability of recording audio, video, and starting phone calls.\nUse of MQTT library which can be used to track the user\n\n\n-----\n\nAccess device information such as phone number, device ID, if a call is active (and\nthe phone number the call is being held with).\nTamper with calls, being able to modify the phone number being dialed.\nRead/write access to the SD card.\nExposed API keys.\n\nKey The main privacy risks identified by our z3A service analysis of PhoneSpy infected\napps are:\n\nExposed services with no permissions assigned.\nWebView enabled, which can be used to execute JavaScript code.\nMalware detected by z9 engine.\nThe app is built with the debug flag.\nUse of system-level permissions and accessibility permissions.\nCan modify WiFi connections.\nHave the capability to perform overlay attacks (one of the main techniques used by\nBanker Trojans).\n\nTo ensure your Android users are protected from PhoneSpy spyware, we recommend a\n[quick risk assessment. Any application with PhoneSpy will be flagged as a Suspicious App](https://www.zimperium.com/z3a-advanced-app-analysis)\nThreat on the device and in the zConsole. Admins can also review which apps are\nsideloaded onto the device, increasing the mobile attack surface and leaving data and\nusers at risk.\n\n## PhoneSpy Spyware’s Impact on Global Enterprises\n\nThe PhoneSpy Android spyware campaign puts enterprises at as much, if not more, risk\nthan consumers. The rise of bring your own device (BYOD) policies has blurred the line\nbetween work and personal data and any compromise to the security of an enterpriseconnected device puts all corporate data at risk. Spyware such as PhoneSpy has the\ncapabilities to read corporate messages, install compromised versions of enterprise\napplications, and download locally stored data like documents and photos without the\nenterprise or end user knowing. The capability to turn on the mobile camera and\nmicrophone during in-person meetings is also a high risk to businesses. These capabilities,\nmixed with the common framework and approach of PhoneSpy, can impact an enterprise’s\nsecurity, reveal critical and private data, and lead to loss of customers, research, and data.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**C&C servers**\n\n1.234.82[.]23\n1.234.82[.]31\n175.126.146[.]147\n\n\n-----\n\nhttps[:]//acd.kcpro.ga\n\n**SHA-256 Hashes and Application Names**\n\n1b762680c64d851151a829e2679c68b4ea19aa825b6fe3866a191bf3d30fac70 Videos\n\n4afbbc8247f0622bb7f40beeaff38083fe1514233c0e545b4ac11e17896548a2 Picture\n\n7ca71565ac1f57725606fd92033928fbd727b810cd507f9d7b0ca2c89853abcf Secret\nTV\n\n45d26f6d4a98ea352aa4411b861ddbee388546326567ce893124bbc8a0d1817b 영상 –\nvideos\n\n84d3e71dc27f7adfb9c6ac628dd240498059b82ec211c99e8ec63e3bc26240ba Daily\nYoga\n\n95de5f5533e6f9a7562e50b4f68bd5ce71227f52a1a9c15ee734cdfb59b27f1d 갤러리\n–\nGallery\n\n208d68c431d58e6d311ae0f2574fab85a1205fc1597e10690116bf406eb5499c Vera\n\n3125ba3f8ad308f93ecc2e167d4f4ecfccc6a1212795ac615e593dceff1ca795 동영상\n–\nVideos\n\n4687ef5f6b9398f2bf3ac84011afce3979145a42f29d35e8fd3ad1b086699952 갤러리\n–\nGallery\n\n58195ad6606265c2d5d34f9b17d81daafc0a65551d8b83d9669a7e96ede786c1 내꺼사\n진 – My\nPicture\n\n70176c319aa4ca24c4cbfdf2b80a8d5ca430fc8370e2515b79f3c3c52ed58dc1 음성지\n원 –\nVoice\nSupport\n\n1568520923f992612163a69d074580885deec03f2727824407f0371cc295aec5 Gallery\n\naf5d676ceecd28c83b8962fc5db012cdada7812cddf856ae63f735a3efd695b7 갤러리\n–\nGallery\n\nb3132e4cd475c381f2ec384b9055ee11ae80b529dcc78f03629106e2d12a50f6 Vera\n\n\n-----\n\nb3333e2542a8d407d7ed6a2f0930d4372a84c9f95478d72ba1d6999c1c4ce74f 클라우\n드 –\nCloud\n\nbeeb1010ca571221b0aa8604f1bf078331b06e378384f8651552b13aa20c9389 야동 –\nPorn\n\nc6793fcb9c647d0439a5bbeec46b5e24afc1e55b8e980669b3c1726d6556c72a Vera\n\ncf03a179b2b8d6a85a6ad3e5cd7405fe9a99c6ce89c6635d8c5d34bc9889b2ba Gallery\n\nd4b6a0055fbaec51c6a2d5edd29eec7768a27b40a6da94223ded28df3726487d 1004\nYoga\n\nd797bf2b4fd7a2cd38da819996e57b39b89ad0e65a0d9633ea332d8234368ce3 갤러리\n–\nGallery\n\nd4428d5eb4f746b3d136d4dbeb3907c82a9ac7fa18efd037d616f2f11dc235ac 한나TV\n–\nHannah\nTV\n\nef467f2389063e044237587ef12f8b0ae37d5b31c5b4efbf0928dfe5b648ed5a Gallery\n\nef29420420802265d3958e05c33badad17d982309bd6f877d15475e64c793692 보안카\n메라 –\nSecurity\nCamera\n\n## About Zimperium\n\nZimperium provides the only mobile security platform purpose-built for enterprise\nenvironments.
