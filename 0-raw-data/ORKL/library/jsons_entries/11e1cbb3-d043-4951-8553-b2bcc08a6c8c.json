And like in a game of\nchess, they are the set pieces that make up their modus operandi.\n\nTake for instance the self-named ChessMaster, a campaign targeting Japanese academe, technology\nenterprises, media outfits, managed service providers, and government agencies. It employs various poisoned\npawns in the form of malware-laden spear-phishing emails containing decoy documents. And beyond\nChessMaster’s endgame and pawns, we also found red flags that allude to its links to APT 10, also known as\nmenuPass, POTASSIUM, Stone Panda, Red Apollo, and CVNX.\n\nChessMaster’s name is from pieces of chess/checkers/draughts we found in the resource section of the main\nbackdoor they use against their targets: ChChes, which Trend Micro detects as BKDR_CHCHES.\n\nWhat makes the campaign unique is its arsenal of tools and techniques:\n\n**_[Malicious shortcut (LNK) files and PowerShell The LNK files execute Command Prompt that](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/rising-trend-attackers-using-lnk-files-download-malware/)_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Self extracting archive (SFX). An archive that drops an executable (EXE), a dynamic link library_**\n(DLL), and a binary file (.BIN). Upon their extraction, malicious code is injected into the process of a\nlegitimate file/application (DLL hijacking). ChessMaster takes it up a notch via load-time dynamic\nlinking to trigger the malicious DLL’s function.\n**_Runtime packers. Throughout its campaign, ChChes used three packers to obfuscate itself and avoid_**\ndetection. The first had no encryption and a varied loader code. The second had a buggy (or antiemulation) exclusive OR (XOR) encryption technique. The third added an AES algorithm on top of\nXOR encryption. Their compile dates overlap, which indicates ChChes’ authors take cues and fine-tune\ntheir malware.\n**_Second-stage payloads. Additional malware are introduced to the infected system for persistence._**\nThese are actually variants of ChChes that use similar entry points but different and encrypted C&C\ncommunication.\n**_Hacking Tools. ChessMaster draws on legitimate email and browser password recovery and dumping_**\ntools they’ve misused and modified for their campaign. These can restore forgotten passwords, which\nare then dumped and retrieved. Lateral movement and further attacks can be worked out from here.\n**_[TinyX. A version of PlugX sans the plug-in functionality that allows it to adopt new capabilities. TinyX](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/plugx-new-tool-for-a-not-so-new-campaign/)_**\nis bundled separately in spear-phishing emails.\n**_RedLeaves. A second-stage backdoor that_** [operates like the open-source and fileless remote access](http://blog.jpcert.or.jp/2017/04/redleaves---malware-based-on-open-source-rat.html)\nTrojan (RAT) [Trochilus, which is known for enabling lateral movement in the infected systems.](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/trojan-variants/trochilus)\nRedLeaves adopted capabilities from PlugX. In April, a RedLeaves variant named himawari (Japanese\nfor sunflower) emerged capable of evading YARA rules released during that time.\n\n**_ChessMaster and APT 10 Plays the Same Cyberespionage Game_**\nAPT 10/menuPass is a cyberespionage group whose specific campaign, [Operation Cloud Hopper, attacked](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/operation-cloud-hopper-what-you-need-to-know)\nthe intermediaries of their targets of interest—managed service providers (MSPs). Its notoriety stems from\ntheir prolific use of multifarious information-stealing backdoors and vulnerability exploits, along with the\ntenacity of its subterfuges, from spear-phishing emails to attack and infection chains. It also abused legitimate\nor open-source remote administration tools to steal data.\n\nIf that sounded familiar, it’s because ChessMaster and APT 10 appear to be playing the same cyberespionage\ngame. Here’s a further illustration:\n\n\n-----\n\ncaught and delved into more ChChes samples in the wild, however, we also saw how they followed the same\npattern—exclusive packers, mutual targets, overlapping C&C infrastructure.\n\nChChes’ packer, for instance, resembled the one used in menuPass’ old PlugX samples. DNS records also\nshowed that some of their command and control (C&C) servers and domains resolved to the same IP address,\nor resided in the same subnet. Are they operated by the same actors? Their commonalities make it appear so.\nIt’s also known to happen; [BlackTech’s cyberespionage campaigns are a case in point.](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/following-trail-blacktech-cyber-espionage-campaigns/)\n\n_Figure 2: Comparison of Emdivi and ChChes_\n\nChessMaster’s ChChes also resembles another backdoor, [Emdivi, which first made waves in 2014. They have](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/attackers-target-organizations-in-japan-transform-local-sites-into-cc-servers-for-emdivi-backdoor/)\nthe same endgame. Both are second-stage payloads that use the system’s Security Identifier (SID) as\nencryption key so they execute only in their target’s machine. Their difference lies in complexity—ChChes\nhides part of the decryption key and payload in registry keys to make it harder to reverse engineer.\n\nBut that’s just one dot in several we’ve connected. In one instance, we detected PlugX and Emdivi on the\nsame machine. This PlugX variant connected to an APT 10/menuPass-owned domain, but the packer is\nsimilar to that used by ChChes. While it’s possible it was hit by two different campaigns, further analysis told\na different story. Both were compiled on the same date, only several hours apart. We detected and acquired\nthe samples the next day, which means both backdoors were delivered to the victim a day after they were\ncompiled.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Overview of the overlaps in ChessMaster and APT 10’s campaigns_\n\n**_Take ‘Control of the Center’_**\nUltimately attacks like ChessMaster’s make pawns out of the systems, networks, devices and their users, all\nof which hold the organization’s crown jewels. This is why enterprises need to be steps ahead of the game:\nprepare, respond, restore, and learn. Plan ahead—what techniques will attackers use? How can I defend\nagainst them? Don’t just pull the plug—understand what happened to better assess and mitigate the damage.\nFine-tune your response—what worked, what didn’t, and what could’ve been done better?\n\nDefense in depth plays a crucial role especially for the IT/system administrators and information security\nprofessionals that watch over them. The [network, endpoints, servers, mobile devices, and web/email](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/security-risk-management/deep-discovery/#network-protection)\n[gateways are the bishops, knights, and rooks that underpin the enterprise’s crown jewels, which is why](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/business/complete-user-protection/index.html)\nsecuring them is important. Reduce their attack surface. Keep the systems updated and regularly patched, and\nenforce the principle of least privilege. Employ behavior monitoring and [application control. Deploy firewalls](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps/endpoint/endpoint-application-control.html)\nas well intrusion detection and prevention systems. Implement URL categorization, [network segmentation,](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/protecting-data-through-network-segmentation)\nand [data categorization.](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/identifying-and-dividing-networks-and-users/)\n\nChessMaster’s gambit is spear-phishing, so it’s especially important to filter and [safeguard the email gateway.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/infosec-guide-email-threats)\nAdditionally, foster a cybersecurity-aware workforce. Seemingly benign icons or decoy documents can still\nswindle the victim, for instance. More importantly, develop proactive incident response and remediation\nstrategies—threat intelligence helps enterprises prepare and mitigate attacks. Like in chess, the more you\nunderstand your enemy’s moves, the more successful you can be at thwarting them.\n\nThe Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) related to ChessMaster’s campaigns is in this [appendix.](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/Appendix-ChessMaster-Makes-its-Move-A-Look-into-the-Campaigns-Cyberespionage-Arsenal.pdf)\n\n_This has been presented in the_ _[RSA Conference 2017 Asia Pacific & Japan as “ChessMaster: A New](https://www.rsaconference.com/events/ap17)_\n_Campaign Targeting Japan Using the New ChChes Backdoor” on July 27, 2017, in Marina Bay Sands,_\n_Singapore._\n\n_Updated on August 14, 2017, 11:50 PM to include IoCs related to ChessMaster._\n\n### Related posts:\n\n[Spam Campaign Delivers Cross-platform Remote Access Trojan Adwind](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/spam-remote-access-trojan-adwind-jrat/)\n[AdGholas Malvertising Campaign Employs Astrum Exploit Kit](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/adgholas-malvertising-campaign-employs-astrum-exploit-kit/)\n[Selling Online Gaming Currency: How It Makes Way for Attacks Against Enterprises](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/selling-online-gaming-currency-makes-way-attacks-enterprises/)\n[BLACKGEAR Espionage Campaign Evolves, Adds Japan To Target List](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/blackgear-espionage-campaign-evolves-adds-japan-target-list/)\n\n\n-----\n\nLearn how to protect Enterprises, Small Businesses, and Home Users from ransomware:\n\n[ENTERPRISE](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/security-intelligence/enterprise-ransomware/index.html) » [SMALL BUSINESS](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/security-intelligence/small-business-ransomware/index.html) » [HOME](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/home/consumer-ransomware/index.html) »\n\n\nTags: [APT10ChChesChessMasterEMDIVImenuPass](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/tag/apt10/)\n\n\n**Comments for this thread are now closed.** **×**\n\n\n**0 Comments** **[TrendLabs](https://disqus.com/home/forums/trendlabs/)** [1](https://disqus.com/home/inbox/) **Login**\n\n\n Recommend\n\n\n### ⤤ Share Sort by Best\n\nThis discussion has been closed.\n\n\n✉ **Subscribe** d **[Add Disqus to your siteAdd DisqusAdd](https://publishers.disqus.com/engage?utm_source=trendlabs&utm_medium=Disqus-Footer)** � **[Privacy](https://disqus.com/)**\n\n\n-----",
