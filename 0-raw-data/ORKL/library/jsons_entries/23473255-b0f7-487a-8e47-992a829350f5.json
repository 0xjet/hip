Each organization decides for itself the risks it can\naccept and the practices it deems appropriate to manage those risks.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis reference document provides a non-prioritized list of the top 10 most common\nvulnerabilities that put control systems in the electricity sector at risk. The list is based on the\ncombined expertise of the NERC Control System Security Working Group (CSSWG). The\nCSSWG updates the list annually based on changes in industry implementation or available\ntechnology. Asset owners are encouraged to use this list to augment their risk management\nprocesses.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy National SCADA Test Bed (NSTB) program has provided\ninitial recommended mitigation strategies to the list of vulnerabilities prepared by the CSSWG\nmembers. Three levels of mitigation strategies are proposed – foundational, intermediate,\nand advanced. Foundational strategies are considered to be minimal mitigation strategies\ntypically involving the establishment of security policy and fundamental implementations.\n**_Intermediate strategies are a next step in establishing a secure posture and involve readily_**\navailable technologies or the stronger implementation of baseline policies. Advanced\nmitigation strategies provide long term achievable security posture guidance but may include\ntools or technologies that are currently not readily available.\n\nThis year’s list also includes explanatory examples to clarify the intent of the CSSWG for each\nvulnerability, and in some cases cautionary notes are also provided where appropriate.\nHowever, in all cases the reader is reminded that technology should always be designed and\ntested for the specific control system environment where they are intended to be deployed to\nproperly consider safety and operational considerations.\n\n## Top 10 Vulnerabilities of Control Systems\n\n1. Inadequate policies, procedures, and culture that govern control system security.\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Lack of overall awareness and appreciation of the risk associated with enabling the\nnetworking of these customized control systems.\n\n  - Absence of control system information security policy.\n\n  - Lack of auditing, enforcing, or adhering to control system information security policy\nnot adhered to, enforced or audited.\n\n  - Lack of adequate risk assessment\n\n**Mitigation Strategies:**\nFoundational\n\n  - Assign a senior manager with overall responsibility for leading and managing the\nentity’s implementation of, and adherence to, robust control system security practices.\n\n  - Document and implement a cyber security policy that represents management’s\ncommitment and ability to secure its critical infrastructure assets. Periodically review\nand update.\n\n  - Develop security procedures and implementation guidance to enable employees to\nimplement specific elements of the cyber security policy.\n\n  - Develop a risk management plan that identifies and documents a risk-based\nassessment methodology to identify its critical assets.
