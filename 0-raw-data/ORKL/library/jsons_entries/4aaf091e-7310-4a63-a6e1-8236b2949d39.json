    "plain_text": "# So Long (Go)Daddy | Tracking BlackTech Infrastructure\n\n**[cyberandramen.net/2022/09/24/so-long-godaddy-tracking-blacktech-infrastructure/](https://cyberandramen.net/2022/09/24/so-long-godaddy-tracking-blacktech-infrastructure/)**\n\nSeptember 24, 2022\n\n## Summary\n\nBlackTech has built a reputation relying on (much to the delight of defenders) tech-themed\ndomains and predictable registration patterns. Recent reporting linking malicious domains to\nthe actor suggests these patterns may be fading, at least for the time being signifying a\ndeparture from the previous infrastructure configuration.\n\n## Items to Note\n\nFailure to redact email addresses within WHOIS records (mitsumori.gb@gmail[.]com,\nwufi2011@gmail[.]com, siraiya128@gmail[.]com, senotice@gmail[.]com) leads to\ndozens more domains likely linked to the actor(s).\nBlackTech prefers dynamic DNS services, with most of the domains’ registrars being\nGoDaddy, paired with domaincontrol[.]com name servers (NS).\nDomain naming conventions centered around technology/target (recent intrusion\nreporting shows this pattern may change).\n\n## Background\n\nBlackTech, a.k.a. Huapi, Temp.Overboard, Circuit Panda, Radio Panda is a cyber espionage\nactor routinely associated but never publicly attributed to Chinese security services. Primary\ntargets of the actor include the technology, financial and government sectors in Taiwan, Hong\nKong, Japan, and recently the U.S.\n\nPlease refer to the excellent reporting by JPCert, NTT, TrendMicro, and PWC’s\n@cyberoverdrive and @malworms.\n\n## Infrastructure New & Old\n\nThe data captured in this post uses multiple vendor reports and VirusTotal and RiskIQ to\ngather passive DNS data. One hundred thirty (130) domains linked to BlackTech were\nidentified and added to a CSV file along with first-seen dates, registrant and registrar\ninformation, and name server information.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Snippet of CSV\n\n\n-----\n\nCSV files allow for identifying possible campaign time-lining and visualizing trends or\npatterns in BlackTech infrastructure tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Reusing\ndomains and overlapping infrastructure across different intrusion sets have become a calling\ncard for the actor(s).\n\nFigure 2: Domains by year\nThe lone spike seen in Figure 1 in 2013 is in large part due to the “Four-Element Sword\nEngagement.”\n\nConstituting nearly a third of the domains registered, GoDaddy and domaincontrol[.]com NS\nhave provided defenders with clues to out related infrastructure before put in use.\n\nAs seen in the below scatter plot, PDR Ltd. and Vitalwerks Internet Solutions, LLC\nrepresents the majority of registrars linked to BlackTech recently.\n\nThis activity consists of registrar changes in addition to name server information, as seen in\nFigure 4.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Scatter plot of registrar use by month/year\nPreviously, defenders may have enjoyed success querying for tech-themed dynamic DNS\ndomains registered to GoDaddy with domaincontrol NS. While small wins in the above\nhunting category may prove fruitful, updated infrastructure configurations should be\nconsidered and watched closely.\n\nFigure 4: Name server count\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Registrar count\nStepping back to look at the above data, three assumptions arise (I will leave the true\nanalysis to the experts):\n\nThe change in infrastructure is only temporary, and a return to normal patterns will\nreturn.\nThe above behavior indicates a group that has had infrastructure burned by security\nvendors and researchers on social media.\nBlackTech campaigns call for different hosting configurations, explaining the change.\n\nUnfortunately, when it comes to the inner workings of not only BlackTech but many APT\ngroups, few defenders have inside knowledge of day-to-day operations.\n\nOnly continued analysis with multiple colored Excel spreadsheets to track changes will inch\nBlue Teamers closer to understanding one of the above assumptions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile these configuration changes may not represent breaking news, identifying adversary\ninfrastructure before malicious activity ensues is very important for defenders.\n\nLike puzzle pieces, registrant names and name servers alone may not provide a pretty\npicture, but when paired with consistent naming themes and other registration information, a\nclearer picture of an adversary emerges.\n\n\n-----",
