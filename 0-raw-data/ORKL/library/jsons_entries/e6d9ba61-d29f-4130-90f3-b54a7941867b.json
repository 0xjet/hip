Chen (Threat Researchers)_\n\n\n-----\n\nWe recently discovered a new campaign that we dubbed “Operation Overtrap” for the\nnumerous ways it can infect or trap victims with its payload. The campaign mainly\ntargets online users of various Japanese banks by stealing their banking credentials\nusing a three-pronged attack. Based on our telemetry, Operation Overtrap has been\nactive since April 2019 and has been solely targeting online banking users located in\nJapan. Our analysis shows that this campaign uses three different attack vectors to\nsteal its victims’ banking credentials:\n\n  - By sending spam emails with a phishing link to a page disguised as a banking\n\nwebsite\n\n  - By sending spam emails asking victims to execute a disguised malware’s\n\nexecutable downloaded from a linked phishing page.\n\n  - By using a custom exploit kit to deliver malware via malvertising\n\nFigure 1. Operation Overtrap three-pronged attack flow\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Discovering Operation Overtrap\n\nWe first discovered the campaign in September 2019 using a then-unidentified exploit\nkit. Based on our data, Operation Overtrap has been using spam emails to deliver its\npayload to victims as early as April 2019.\n\nIn mid-September, we observed a significant number of victims being redirected to the\nexploit kit, which targeted Internet Explorer, after they have clicked on links from social\n\n\n-----\n\nmedia platforms. It should be noted, however, that the way the victims received the links\nhas not been identified. It is also worth mentioning that Operation Overtrap only seems\nto target Japanese online banking users; it redirects victims with different geolocations\nto a fake online shop.\n\nOur analysis revealed that the exploit kit only dropped a clean binary that does not\nperform malicious activities on a victim’s device. It also immediately closes after\ninfection. It is still unclear why the threat actors behind Operation Overtrap initially\ndelivered a clean binary file; it’s possible that they were testing their custom exploit kit\nduring this stage of the campaign’s development.\n\nFigure 2. A screengrab that shows exploit kit network traffic in September 2019\n\nFigure 3. A screengrab that features a clean file dropped by Operation Overtrap’s\n\nexploit kit\n\n### Operation Overtrap’s Custom Exploit Kit: Bottle Exploit Kit\n\nOn September 29, 2019, we observed that the exploit kit ceased to drop a clean file,\nand instead, delivered a brand-new banking trojan that we dubbed “Cinobi.” We also\nnoted that the threat actors behind Operation Overtrap have stopped redirecting victims\nfrom social media and began to use a Japan-targeted malvertising campaign to push\ntheir custom exploit kit.\n\nAnother researcher later discovered the custom exploit kit, which was named the Bottle\nExploit Kit (BottleEK). It exploits CVE-2018-15982, a Flash Player use after free\nvulnerability, as well as CVE-2018-8174, a VBScript remote code execution\nvulnerability. Victims will be infected with BottleEK’s payload if they access this\n\n\n-----\n\nparticular exploit kit’s landing page with unpatched or outdated browsers. Our telemetry\nshows that BottleEK was the most active exploit kit detected in Japan in February 2020.\n\nFigure 4. Exploit kit activity observed in Japan on February 2020 (Data obtained from\n\nTrend Micro Smart Protection Network™)\n\nBottleEK performs the following steps during the compromise of an infected machine:\n\n1. Check if the browser cookie “username” has been set. If it’s set, it will not perform\n\nany action. Otherwise, it will set a “username” cookie with the value “bingv” and\ncontinue the infection. This step aims to filter out victims who have been previously\nattacked to prevent a double infection.\n\nFigure 5. Screengrab of code showing the BottleEK script verifying browser cookie\n\ninformation\n\n2. Check if the browser is Internet Explorer and if the browser language is set to\n\nJapanese. If not, it will stop the infection.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Screengrab of code showing the BottleEK script checking the infected device’s\n\nbrowser language and browser version\n\n3. Check the version of Internet Explorer, Adobe Flash Player, and the architecture of\n\nthe infected machine. It then sends the gathered information with an Ajax request to\nthe exploit kit hosting server in this format:\n“/conn.php?callback=?data1={Internet Explorer version}&data2={64 bits or 32 bits\narchitecture}&data3={Adobe Flash Player version}”.\n\nFigure 7. Screengrab of the BottleEK script sending information of the victim machine\n\nand loading the corresponding exploit\n\n4. Based on the information received by the exploit kit server, it will return the location\n\nof different exploit codes and instruct the browser to load them accordingly. The\nexploits used by BottleEK include CVE-2018-15982, an Adobe Flash exploit, and\nCVE-2018-8174, a VBScript engine exploit.\n5. After successful exploitation, it will load the malware from the URL\n\n“/conn[.]php?ge=1” and execute it. It is worth noting that if the cookie “username”\nset during the first step is not present during the request to load the exploit, the\n\n\n-----\n\nexploit kit server will return an empty response. This is an anti-crawl feature that\nprevents web crawlers from directly grabbing the campaign’s payloads.\n\nAn analysis of the shellcodes embedded and executed by the exploits reveals the use\nof Metasploit encoders. In the case of 32-bit shellcode, we observed the use of the\nShikata Ga Nai encoder. Meanwhile, the 64-bit shellcode uses XOR dynamic encoder.\n\nFigure 8. Screengrab of shellcode encoded with the “Shikata Ga Nai” encoder\n\nFigure 9. Screengrab of shellcode encoded with the XOR dynamic” encoder\n\nFigure 10. Screengrab showing the Flash exploit containing both 32-bit and 64-bit\nshellcodes in one exploit file\n\n\n-----\n\n### Brand-new banking malware: Cinobi\n\nOperation Overtrap used a new banking malware we’ve decided to call Cinobi. Based\non our analysis, Cinobi has two versions — the first one has a DLL library injection\npayload that compromises victims’ web browsers to perform form-grabbing.\n\nThis Cinobi version can also modify web traffic sent to and received from targeted\nwebsites. Our investigation found that all the websites that this campaign targeted were\nthose of Japan-based banks.\n\nAside from form-grabbing, it also has a webinject function that allows cybercriminals the\nability to modify accessed webpages. The second version has all the capabilities of the\nfirst one plus the ability to communicate with a command-and-control (C&C) server over\nthe Tor proxy.\n\n### Cinobi’s four stages of infection \n\nEach of Cinobi’s four stages contains an encrypted position-independent shellcode that\nmakes analysis slightly more complicated. Each stage is downloaded from a C&C\nserver after certain conditions have been met.\n\n##### First stage\n\nThe first stage of Cinobi’s infection chain, which has also been analyzed by another\ncybersecurity researcher, starts by calling the “GetUserDefaultUILanguages”\nfunction to check if the infected device’s local settings are set to Japanese.\n\nFigure 5. Screengrab of Cinobi’s check to determine the device’s language settings using\n\n“GetUserDefaultUILanguages”\n\nCinobi will then download legitimate unzip.exe and Tor applications from the following\nlocations:\n\n   - ftp://ftp[.]cadwork.ch/DVD_V20/cadwork.dir/COM/unzip[.]exe\n\n    - https://archive[.]torproject[.]org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/8.0.8/tor\nwin32-0.3.5.8[.]zip\n\nAfter extracting the Tor archive into the “\\AppData\\LocalLow\\” directory, Cinobi will\nrename tor.exe to taskhost.exe and execute it. It will also run tor.exe with custom torrc\nfile settings.\n\n\n-----\n\n  - \"C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\LocalLow\\<random_name>\\Tor\\taskhost.exe\" –f\n\n  - \"C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\LocalLow\\<random_name>\\torrc\"\n\nIt will download the second stage of the malware payload from a .onion C&C address\nand save it in a randomly named .DLL file within the “\\AppData\\LocalLow\\” folder. The\nfilename of the first stage downloader is saved into a .JPG file with a random name.\n\nFigure 6. Screengrab of .JPG file that contains the filename of the first stage\n\ndownloader\n\nAfter this, Cinobi will run the second stage of its downloader on the victim’s machine.\n\nFigure 7. Screengrab of code showing Cinobi running the second stage of its\n\ndownloader on the victim’s machine\n\n#### Second stage\n\nCinobi will connect to its C&C server to download and decrypt the file for the third stage\nof its infection chain. We observed that the filename of the third stage starts with the\nletter C, followed by random characters. Afterward, it will download and decrypt the file\nfor the fourth stage, which has a filename that starts with the letter A, followed by\nrandom characters.\n\nAfter these, Cinobi will download and decrypt a config file (<random_name>.txt) that\ncontains a new C&C address.\n\nCinobi uses RC4 encryption with a hardcoded key.\n\nFigure 8. Screengrab of code showing Cinobi’s decoded config file\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, Cinobi will run the downloaded third stage infection file using the UAC bypass\nmethod via the CMSTPLUA COM interface.\n\n#### Third stage \nDuring the third infection stage, Cinobi will copy malware files from\n“\\AppData\\LocalLow\\” to the “%PUBLIC%” folder. It will then install the fourth stage of\nthe downloader (which was downloaded during the second stage) as Winsock Layered\nService Provider (WSCInstallProviderAndChains).\n\nFigure 9. Screengrab of code showing the installation of the infection’s fourth stage\n\non the victim machine as “WSCInstallProviderAndChains”\n\nCinobi will then perform the following actions:\n\n  - Change spooler service config to “SERVICE_AUTO_START”\n\n  - Disable the following services:\n```\n     o UsoSvc\n     o Wuauserv\n     o WaaSMedicSvc\n     o SecurityHealthService\n     o DisableAntiSpyware\n\n```\n  - Copy and extract Tor files to “%PUBLIC%” folder\n\n  - Rename tor.exe to taskhost.exe\n\n  - Create torrc in “%PUBLIC%” with the content “DataDirectory\n\nC:\\Users\\Public\\<random_nam>\\data\\tor”\n\n  - Create .JPG file with the original dropper name\n\n  - Remove files from “\\AppData\\LocalLow\\” and remove the original dropper file\n\n#### Fourth stage\nCinobi will call the WSCEnumProtocols function to retrieve information about available\ntransport protocols. It will also call the **WSCGetProviderPath function to retrieve the**\nDLL path of the original transport provider. This function is called twice. The first call will\nreturn the malicious provider (as the fourth stage of the malware has already been\n\n\n-----\n\ninstalled during the third stage of infection). The second call will return the original\ntransport provider (“%SystemRoot%\\system32\\mswsock.dll”) and resolve and call its\nWSPStartup function. Cinobi will then check the name of the process in which the\nmalicious DLL provider gets injected. In practice, Cinobi should be injected into all\nprocesses that make network connections using Windows sockets.\n\nFigure 10. Screengrab of processes where the malicious DLL provider has been\n\ninjected\n\nCinobi banker’s functionality depends on the process in which it has been loaded:\n\n|Process Name|Functionalities|\n|---|---|\n|chrome.exe|• Hooks Chrome APIs handling SSL functionality|\n|firefox.exe|• Hooks APIs (nss3.dll, nspr4.dll; PR_OpenTCPSocket, PR_Close, PR_Read, PR_Write, PR_GetNameForIdentity, PR_SetError)|\n|iexplore.exe|• Hooks Internet Explorer APIs handling SSL functionality|\n|lsass.exe|• The same functionalities as spoolsv.exe, except that it doesn’t write default config files and disable wuauserv|\n|spoolsv.exe|• Creates a thread that writes a .cfg file containing an|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|environment hash (unique identifier of victim machine) • Creates a thread that disables Google Chrome Auto Updates, reads .wmv config file that links to an archive with an installer of an older version of Chrome 53. This thread downloads and installs this old Chrome version and modifies .lnk files for the Google Chrome browser • Creates a thread that modifies Firefox's profiles.ini • Modifies IE settings • Writes all other default config files with various file extensions (.txt, .bmp, .png, .wmv) • Runs thread which regularly attempts to close the wuauserv service|\n|---|---|\n\n\nCinobi exits if it is injected into any of the following antivirus processes:\n\n- ahnlab\n\n- avast\n\n- avg\n\n- avira\n\n- bitdefender\n\n- comodo\n\n- doctor web\n\n- drweb\n\n- Fortinet\n\n- f-secure\n\n- g data\n\n- Kaspersky\n\n- mcafee\n\n- norton\n\n- smartscreen.exe\n\n- sophos\n\n- trend\n\n- windows defender\n\n\n-----\n\n### Cinobi’s Dropped Configuration files\n\nCinobi drops various configuration files while running though all four stages of infection.\nAll these files have different extensions and are encrypted with the same hardcoded\nRC4 key. We have decrypted the configuration files and analyzed them below:\n\n  - **<random_name>.bmp contains a list of targeted financial institutions.**\n\n  - **<random_name>.cfg contains an environment hash, which is a unique identifier**\n\nfor a victim machine.\n\n  - **<random_name>.png contains web injects. As seen from screenshot below, the**\n\nfile only contains “localhost” with a random string. This may indicate that the\nthreat actor does not need to use web injects at all.\n\n  - **<random_name>.txt contains a list of C&C servers.**\n\n  - **<random_name>.wmv contains a link for downloading an older Google Chrome**\n\nversion (Chrome 53) because, as mentioned in this paper, this particular version\nof Google Chrome uses a “completely different virtual method table” to search for\nSSL functions to hook. It seems that the attackers have yet to develop a working\nmethod for hooking newer Chrome SSL functions.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Running Cinobi banking Trojan\n\nTo fully analyze the Cinobi banking Trojan, we ran it on a testing machine. In order to\nrun Cinobi, the machine’s system must be set to Japanese locale or, to bypass the\nlocale check, patch the downloader from the first stage of the infection.\n\n#### Testing web injects\n\nEven though web injects were not used in this campaign, we tested the web injects by\nrunning a simple webserver with a website containing the keyword “opqrst.” According\nto the dropped configuration settings, “opqrst” should be appended with the keyword\n“aaaaaaa” on an infected machine.\n\n  - To do this test, we first ran an HTTP server using the Python SimpleHTTPServer\n\nmodule.\n\n  - We then created the “index.html” webpage with the following content:\n\n  - We opened localhost on the web browser and found seven consecutive letter As\n\ninjected after each “opqrst” keyword. This proves that the web injects work.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Testing the form-grabbing feature\n\nTo test Cinobi’s form-grabbing feature, we loaded a website belonging to one of the\ntargeted financial institutions and attempted to input data into one of its HTML forms to\nsee what happens when the form is submitted.\n\n  - We proceeded to enter random digits (we used 7777, 8888, and 99999) on one\n\nof the HTML forms, .\n\n  - Soon after, we observed the creation of a randomly named .txt file with content\n\nthat was encrypted with the same RC4 password as the other configuration files.\nAfter decrypting the .txt file, it revealed the decrypted HTTPS request. The userentered data is shown below, in red. This .txt file is submitted to the banking\ntrojan’s C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Connections to previous phishing attacks\n\nAlthough we have identified that the Cinobi banking trojan is mainly being dropped by\nthe Bottle exploit kit, we have also observed similar samples being distributed in the\nwild since April 2019. These samples look almost similar to the Cinobi banking trojan,\nbut without the ability to download, install, and communicate over the Tor proxy. We\nsuspect that these samples were the earlier version of Cinobi (marked as Cinobi V1)\nand the one with the Tor functionality we received from BottleEK is the second version\n(marked as Cinobi V2).\n\nAnother connection relates to the domain used by Cinobi V1’s C&C server\n(cionx[.]inteleksys[.]com), which has the same base domain as the server of Bottle\nexploit kit (sales[.]inteleksys[.]com). We noticed that the campaign reuses the domain\ninteleksys[.]com but uses different subdomains. It is worth noting that the domain was\nused to host a legitimate website, but after its registration expired, cybercriminals reregistered it and started using it for malicious purposes. It is also possible that the\noriginally legitimate domain is included in cybersecurity solutions’ whitelists.\n\nDuring the investigation of Cinobi V1, we found that the malware was not distributed via\nexploit kit, but was distributed with a phishing page sent via spam email. The phishing\npage was disguised as an office bank website asking victims to install a new certificate\nto enhance security measures. However, the link to the certificate file is Cinobi V1’s\nloader.\n\nThe Cinobi V1 phishing page could also be found via several domains that use\ntyposquatting techniques to fool internet users who mistype domains belonging to\nlegitimate Japanese banks on their internet browsers.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Example of a phishing page that contains the Cinobi V1 loader (Screenshot\n\nfrom urlscan.io)\n\nWhen we checked the domains linking these phishing pages, we found that one of the\nIP addresses, 118[.]27[.]34[.]110, was associated with other phishing domains and\noverlapped with another domain, “ts3cardd[.com],” which was used in a phishing attack\ndelivered via spam email, according to an alert issued by one of the targeted banks.\n\nWe also learned that the registration information of a phishing domain used to deliver\nCinobi V1 overlapped with several domains hosting Amazon-themed phishing sites.\nThese connections show that this campaign might also employ typical phishing attacks\nto grab credentials from unsuspecting victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. Domain registration information overlap between the phishing site\n(japanp0st.jp) delivering Cinobi V1 and an Amazon-themed phishing site (safetb\namazon[.]jp).\n\nNote: The profile used in the domain information is fake\n\n## Best practices against spam and vulnerabilities \n\nOperation Overtrap uses a variety of attack vectors to steal banking credentials. Users\nand organizations need to adopt best practices to ensure that their systems are\nprotected against messaging-related threats as well as falling prey to malicious\nadvertisements. An example of a best practice an organization must have is having a\ncentral point for reporting suspicious emails. Organizations, through their IT teams,\nneed to have a centralized information gathering system. For this to be effective, all\nemployees must be aware of the reporting procedure for suspicious emails. Meanwhile,\nto avoid malicious advertisements, users should be wary of clicking suspicious links or\npop-ups and make sure to actively update software via official channels only.\n\nOrganizations will greatly benefit from regularly updating systems (or use virtual\npatching for legacy systems) to prevent attackers from taking advantage of security\ngaps. Additional security mechanisms like enabling firewalls and intrusion detection and\nprevention systems will help thwart suspicious network activities that may indicate red\nflags like data exfiltration or C&C communication.\n\n### Trend Micro Solutions \n\nOrganizations can consider Trend Micro™ endpoint solutions such as Trend Micro\nSmart Protection Suites and Worry-Free™ Business Security.
