The threat actor tracked in their report shared many\n[similarities to the China-linked threat actor Chimera, whom CyCraft attributed to a year-long](https://medium.com/cycraft/taiwan-high-tech-ecosystem-targeted-by-foreign-apt-group-5473d2ad8730)\ncyberattack targeting the Taiwan semiconductor industry just last year.\n\nMuch like Chimera, the threat actor mentioned in the Fox-IT & NCC Group report (referred to\nin this article as CUTR, Chimera Under the Radar) targeted intellectual property (IP) from the\nsemiconductor industry; however, the report goes into further detail explaining how their\n\n\n-----\n\nthreat actor s targets were more diverse, including targeting sensitive data from the EU\naviation industry.\n\nIn this article, we analyze and compare their research to ours.\n\n## Conclusions\n\n1. There is a strong probability the threat actor, CUTR, is Chimera as their IoCs,\n\ncommonly used infra, tools, techniques, and behaviors are all very similar to Chimera;\n42 of the 67 adversarial techniques used in both campaigns were identical.\n2. China-linked threat actors (e.g., Chimera, BlackTech, APT30) are known to share tools\n\nand attack methods with each other, making attribution challenging.\n3. Some differences in attack behavior may be due to differences in the victims’\n\narchitecture, security maturity, or geographic location (EU, not Taiwan). Different\nenvironments may require different TTP. TTP designed for infiltrating Taiwan’s\nsemiconductor industry may require adjustment for the EU aviation industry and vice\nversa.\n4. Chimera was focused solely on the Taiwan semiconductor industry. CUTR showed “a\n\nwide set of interests,” including the EU semiconductor industry as well as aviation.\nWhile some China-linked threat actors have demonstrated an ability to adapt\ntechniques, tools, and targets, sudden changes in attack behavior are not common —\nkeeping true to the ideas behind Bianco’s Pyramid of Pain, as mentioned in the Fox-IT\n& NCC Group report. As TTPs are the hardest to change and tend to stay inflexible for\nlonger periods of time, similar TTP usage between different attack\ncampaigns/operations is a strong indicator of attribution.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs mentioned in the FOX-IT & NCC Group report, Bianco s Pyramid of Pain illustrates how\ndifficult it is for an attacker to circumvent a particular attack method that has been stripped\naway from them. For example, while blocking a file or IP address is rather trivial for an\nattacker to get around, taking away an attacker’s tool is challenging; they will have to devise\na new way of carrying out their objectives.\n\nAccording to the Fox-IT & NCC Group report, “the largest overlap [between Chimera and\ntheir threat actor] is in the top half of the Pyramid of Pain: domain names, host artifacts,\ntools, and TTPs.”\n\nWe will compare Chimera with CUTR using the Pyramid of Pain model from the ground up.\n\n## Hash Values\n\nThe following table shows the hash of these IoCs. As depicted in the table, 3 of the hashes\nare identical to our research. Even though the identical WinRAR and get.exe can be easily\nused by other threat actors, the added inclusion of the Cloud exfil tool increases the\nprobability of Chimera attribution.\n\nChimera primarily used both the Cobalt Strike Beacon and the Winnti backdoors during their\noperation against Taiwan’s semiconductor industry. CUTR was not observed using the Winnti\nbackdoor but was observed using Cobalt Strike Beacon’s remote access functionality;\nhowever, we cannot confirm if it is the exact same Cobalt Strike Beacon as Fox-IT & NCC\nGroup did not release the hash in their report.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n4d5440282b69453f4eb6232a1689dd4ac9b8cab697f23e6ee9b1096e312e8573133a159e86ff48c59e79e6\n\n## IP address & Domain Name\n\n```\nNone of the domain names are identical, but the behavior of abusing the cloud platforms\nsuch as Appspot or Azure Edge is aligned with our findings. This increases the probability of\nChimera attribution.\n\n## Network & Host Artifacts\n\nSome file names used are similar to our research. Here we list some similar naming\nschemes.\n\nRecordedTV.ms\nOneDrive.exe\nupdate.exe\njucheck.exe\n\n## Tool\n\n\n-----\n\nThe tools used by their threat actor significantly overlap with our research into Chimera.\n\nCobalt Strike\nOneDrive\nModified RAR\nCloud Service\n\n## TTP\n\nAccording to the Pyramid of Pain model, TTP are the most difficult and less frequently\nchanged methods of an attacker, suggesting that campaigns/operations with multiple\nsimilarities in TTP are most likely performed by the same threat actor.\n\nComparing the adversarial techniques used by Chimera and CUTR, 42 of the 67 adversarial\ntechniques used in both campaigns were identical. Below are a few notable similarities and\ndifferences.\n\n## Techniques critical to both Chimera & CUTR’s attack behavior:\n\nT1003.003 OS Credential Dumping: NTDS\nT1003.001 OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory\nT1053.005 Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task\nT1078 Valid Accounts\n\n## Observed only in CUTR:\n\nT1574.002 Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading\n\nT1111 Two-Factor Authentication Interception\n\nT1550.002 Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Hash\n\n## Observed only in Chimera:\n\nT1055.001 Process Injection: Dynamic-link Library Injection\nT1556.001 Modify Authentication Process: Domain Controller Authentication\n\nDifferences in attack behavior may be due to differences in the victims’ architecture, security\nmaturity, geographic location (EU, not Taiwan), or differences in visibility.\n\nBoth threat actors are China-based and located in the UTC +8 timezone.\n\nThe TTP used by both Chimera and CUTR are summarized below — mapped in the MITRE\nATT&CK® framework.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Initial Access\n\n Execution\n\n Credential Access\n\n Lateral Movement\n\n Collection\n\n Exfiltration\n\n Summary\n\nThreat attribution is difficult.\n\nChina-linked threat actors are known to share tools and attack methods (and possibly even\npersonnel) with each other. Differences in victim security operational culture, geographic\nlocation, system architecture, security maturity, industry, and defense technology can all lead\nto minor and major differences in attack behavior. There are always numerous factors to\nconsider and weigh, making perfect attribution difficult.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, the evidence presented after comparing research from both CyCraft and Fox-IT &\nNCC Group illustrates a strong likelihood that CUTR is Chimera.\n\nChimera and CUTR are both located in the UTC +8 timezone, are China-based, and have a\nstrong overlap in IoCs, commonly used infra, tools, techniques, and behavior. 42 of the 67\nadversarial techniques used in both Chimera and CUTR campaigns were identical.\n\nCyCraft confirms with high confidence that CUTR is Chimera.\n\nWe would like to thank Fox-IT & NCC Group for their detailed report, added visibility into the\nChimera threat, and added threat intelligence against this China-based threat actor so that\nSOCs can better defend their organizations and keep their data secure.\n\n## Everything Starts From Security\n\nCyCraft Customers can prevent cyber intrusions from escalating into business-altering\nincidents.
