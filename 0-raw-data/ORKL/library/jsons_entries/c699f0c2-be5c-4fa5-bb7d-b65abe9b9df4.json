The\nsummaries are based on our threat intelligence research and provide a representative\nsnapshot of what we have published and discussed in greater detail in our private APT\nreports. They are designed to highlight the significant events and findings that we feel people\nshould be aware of.\n\nThis is our latest installment, focusing on activities that we observed during Q3 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rZQgvU8eeUs\n\nReaders who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more\n[information on a specific report are encouraged to contact intelreports@kaspersky.com.](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## The most remarkable findings\n\nThe SolarWinds incident reported last December stood out because of the extreme\ncarefulness of the attackers and the high-profile nature of their victims. The evidence\nsuggests that the threat actor behind the attack, DarkHalo (aka Nobelium), had spent six\nmonths inside OrionIT’s networks to perfect their attack. In June, more than six months after\nDarkHalo had gone dark, we observed the DNS hijacking of multiple government zones of a\nCIS member state that allowed the attacker to redirect traffic from government mail servers\nto computers under their control – probably achieved by obtaining credentials to the control\npanel of the victims’ registrar. When victims tried to access their corporate mail, they were\nredirected to a fake copy of the web interface. Following this, they were tricked into\ndownloading previously unknown malware. The backdoor, dubbed Tomiris, bears a number\nof similarities to the second-stage malware, Sunshuttle (aka GoldMax), used by DarkHalo\nlast year. However, there are also a number of overlaps between Tomiris and Kazuar, a\nbackdoor that has been linked to the Turla APT threat actor. None of the similarities is\nenough to link Tomiris and Sunshuttle with high confidence. However, taken together they\nsuggest the possibility of common authorship or shared development practices. You can read\n[more about our findings here.](https://securelist.com/darkhalo-after-solarwinds-the-tomiris-connection/104311/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Disclaimer: when referring to APT groups as Russian-speaking, Chinese-speaking or_\n_“speaking” other languages, we refer to various artefacts used by the groups (such as_\n_malware debugging strings, comments found in scripts, etc.) containing words in these_\n_languages, based on the information we obtained directly or which was otherwise publicly_\n_known and reported widely. The use of certain languages does not necessarily indicate a_\n_specific geographic relation but rather points to the languages that the developers behind_\n_these APT artefacts use._\n\n## Russian-speaking activity\n\nThis quarter we identified several malicious infection documents, droppers and implants that\nare typical of Gamaredon; and which may suggest an ongoing malicious campaign against\nthe Ukrainian government, possibly active since May. We could not precisely identify the\nassociated infection chains, as we could only retrieve parts of them from any live exploitation\ncontext. However, we were able to attribute the activity with medium to high confidence to\nGamaredon. Our private report gave details about the various droppers along with decoder\nscripts, as well as analysis of the DStealer backdoor and the large infrastructure we\nobserved associated with the campaign.\n\nReconHellcat is a little-known threat actor that was spotted publicly in 2020. The first\naccounts of its activity date back to March last year, in which archives carrying COVIDrelated decoy file names that contained a malicious executable were described in a tweet by\nMalwareHunterTeam. The malicious implant within the archive, dubbed BlackWater, would in\nturn drop and open a lure document and subsequently contact Cloudflare Workers as C2\nservers – an unusual choice that is not often encountered in use by other actors. Since the\nfirst sightings of this intrusion set, similar TTPs have been used as part of other attacks that\nwere covered by QuoIntelligence, suggesting the underlying actor is operating in a targeted\nfashion while going after high-profile government-related targets. This activity seems to have\ncontinued and stretched into 2021, when we spotted a set of recent attacks using the same\ntechniques and malware to gain a foothold in diplomatic organizations based in Central Asia.\nIn our private report we described this activity, with an eye to the various changes the actor\nmade to elements in the infection chain, likely as a result of previous public exposure of its\nactivity.\n\nSince then, we have identified additional documents operated by ReconHellcat; and a new\ncampaign emerged from August through to September with an evolved infection chain. This\n[campaign was also covered by researchers at Zscaler in a blog post. Some of the changes](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/cloudfall-targets-researchers-and-scientists-invited-international-military)\nintroduced in the renewed activity include relying on Microsoft Word templates (.dotm) for\npersistence, instead of the previously used Microsoft Word add-ons (.wll). Nevertheless,\nsome TTPs remain unchanged, as the new infection chain still delivers the same final\nimplant, the Blacksoul malware, and still uses Cloudflare Workers as C2 servers.\nReconHellcat goes after government organizations and diplomatic entities related to\n\n\n-----\n\ncountries in Central Asia, such as Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan and Turkmenistan.\nAdditionally, we identified victims from two countries we did not encounter in the previous\nwave of attacks: Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. We assess, with a medium level of confidence,\nthat ReconHellcat is a Russian-speaking threat actor.\n\n## Chinese-speaking activity\n\nAn APT threat actor, suspected to be HoneyMyte, modified a fingerprint scanner software\ninstaller package on a distribution server in a country in South Asia. The APT modified a\nconfiguration file and added a DLL with a .NET version of a PlugX injector to the installer\npackage. On installation, even without network connectivity, the .NET injector decrypts and\ninjects a PlugX backdoor payload into a new svchost system process and attempts to\nbeacon to a C2. Employees of the central government in a country in South Asia are\nrequired to use this biometric package to support recording attendance. We refer to this\nsupply-chain incident and this particular PlugX variant as SmudgeX. The Trojanized installer\nappears to have been staged on the distribution server from March to June.\n\nDuring 2020 and 2021, we detected a new ShadowPad loader module, dubbed\nShadowShredder, used against critical infrastructure across multiple countries, including but\nnot limited to India, China, Canada, Afghanistan and Ukraine. Upon further investigation we\nalso discovered additional implants deployed through both ShadowPad and\nShadowShredder, such as Quarian backdoor, PlugX, Poison Ivy and other hack tools.\nNotably, the Quarian backdoor and Poison Ivy showed similarities with previous IceFog\nactivity targeting users in Central Asia. ShadowPad is a highly sophisticated, modular\n[cyberattack platform that APT groups have used since 2017. We published a blog post at](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/)\nthat time detailing the technical details of ShadowPad and its supply-chain attack campaign\nafter its initial discovery, when it was deployed by an APT group known as Barium or APT41.\nIn Q1 2020, we published private reports with the discovery of x64 ShadowPad dropper\nsamples. The loader module used a unique anti-analysis trick that involves the loader\nmodule checking whether it’s been loaded via the specific EXE file by looking inside the\nmemory space of the loader module for some hard coded bytes before the decryption of\nembedded shellcode. The ShadowShredder loaders we discovered more recently don’t\nmake use of this technique, incorporating a new obfuscation method instead. Our report\ndiscusses the technical analysis of ShadowShredder and related activities using secondstage payloads linked to ShadowShredder and ShadowPad.\n\n[ESET published a blog post in June describing a campaign targeting foreign affairs ministries](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/06/10/backdoordiplomacy-upgrading-quarian-turian/)\nand telecoms companies in Africa and the Middle East by an actor they dubbed\nBackdoorDiplomacy and categorized as Chinese-speaking. We link this activity with high\nconfidence to an actor we’re tracking under the alias CloudComputating, known to target\nhigh-profile entities in the Middle East. In their investigation ESET discovered a Quarian\nLinux variant sample sharing a C2 server with Windows variants, which was reportedly\n\n\n-----\n\ndeployed by exploiting a known RCE vulnerability (CVE-2020-5902) in F5 Networks BIG-IP\ntraffic management user interface or configuration utility. The same Quarian ELF binary was\nalso mentioned being deployed on an F5 BIG-IP server in a SANS ISC report in July 2020,\none year earlier. Our private research report expanded the analysis of the Quarian Linux\nvariant and its ties to the Windows version.\n\nLast year, we described a campaign attributed to CloudComputating in which the APT actor\nexploited a known vulnerability to compromise publicly exposed Microsoft Exchange servers\nand infected them with the China Chopper web shell. The malicious payload was then used\nto upload additional malware, usually the Quarian backdoor that has been seen in use by\nChinese-speaking actors since around 2010. This campaign affected Ethiopia, Palestine and\nKuwait. ESET’s blog post (see above) allowed us to link their campaign to the one we\ndescribed in June last year and extend our previous investigation to find new unknown\nvariants and victims. Our private report covered the version ESET dubbed Turian, two other\nformerly unknown Quarian versions, an overview of a builder component used to generate\nmalicious Quarian libraries and an extended list of IoCs.\n\nExCone is a set of attacks that started in mid-March against targets in the Russian\nFederation. The attackers exploited Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities to deploy a previously\nunknown Trojan that we dubbed FourteenHI. During our previous analysis, we found multiple\nties in infrastructure and TTPs to the ShadowPad malware and UNC2643 activity. However,\nwe were unable to attribute the attack to any known actor. Following our first report, we\ncontinued to monitor this cluster of activities and we found many other variants, which\nextended our knowledge of the attackers and the campaign itself. We found new malware\nsamples used against a large number of targets, with victims in Europe, Central Asia and\nSoutheast Asia. We also observed a cluster of publicly reported activities by various other\nvendors that we are able to link to ExCone with high confidence. Finally, we found a new\nmalware sample that allows us to link ExCone to the SixLittleMonkeys APT group with low\nconfidence. Specifically, we found a victim compromised by FourteenHI and another\nunknown backdoor. This new “unknown backdoor” presents similarities to both FourteenHI\nand Microcin, a Trojan exclusively attributed to SixLittleMonkeys that we described in other\nreports available on our Threat Intelligence Portal.\n\nThis quarter, we also pursued our investigations of what is widely known to be Chinesespeaking activities in South Asia. We discovered another set of TTPs targeting aerospace\nand defense research establishments in India between 2019 and the end of June 2021,\nfeaturing two previously unknown backdoors: LGuarian and HTTP_NEWS. The former\nappears to be a new variant of the Quarian backdoor, which this attacker also uses. Thanks\nto our telemetry, we obtained extensive information on the attacker’s post-exploitation\nprocess and were able to provide a detailed picture of the various tools they use during this\nphase, as well as actions performed on the victims’ machines. This allowed us to gather a\nwide number of malware samples and subsequently discover a significant part of the\nattacker’s infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\n[On June 3, Check Point published a report about an ongoing surveillance operation targeting](https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/chinese-apt-group-targets-southeast-asian-government-with-previously-unknown-backdoor/)\na Southeast Asian government, and attributed the malicious activities to a Chinese-speaking\nthreat actor named SharpPanda. We published a private report providing additional data on\nthe associated malicious activities and tools, based on our own visibility of this threat.\n\nIn April, we investigated a number of malicious installer files mimicking Microsoft Update\nInstaller files, signed with a stolen digital certificate from a company called QuickTech.com.\nThese fake installers exhibited very convincing visuals, which reflect the amount of effort that\nwent into making them look legitimate. The final payload, which was a Cobalt Strike beacon\nmodule, was also configured with a “microsoft.com” subdomain C2 server. The C2 domain\ncode.microsoft[.]com was a dangling DNS subdomain, which was registered by the attackers\naround April 15 to masquerade as the official Visual Studio Code website. The victims were\ntricked into downloading and executing these installers on their machines through a fake\nMicrosoft Update Catalog webpage, which was also hosted on another dangling subdomain\nof “microsoft.com”. While investigating the malicious installer files, we came across other\nmalicious binaries which, based on various indications, we assume were developed and\nused by the same threat actor, active since at least January and up until June. Our private\nreport provided an analysis of the extended toolset of this threat actor, which we named\nCraneLand.\n\nIn July, we identified a suspicious JavaScript (JS) inclusion on two websites that openly\ncriticize China and which appear to be legitimate. The obfuscated JS is loaded from a remote\ndomain name that impersonates the Google brand and initiates a malicious JS payload\nchain. The compromised websites still include the JS, but we could not link any other\nmalicious activities or infrastructure to this watering-hole attack. The malicious JS does not\nseem to fit traditional cybercriminal goals, and its activities are quite unusual compared to\nthose we have observed in other watering-hole attacks. We believe the malicious JS\npayloads are aimed at profiling and targeting individuals from Hong Kong, Taiwan or China.\nAny connections to the described malicious domains should be carefully reviewed to look for\nsubsequent malicious activities.\n\n## Middle East\n\nLyceum is a threat group operating against high-profile targets in the Middle East since at\nleast 2018. This year, we uncovered significant activity by the group focused on Tunisia’s\naviation and telecoms sectors. Throughout this campaign the attackers demonstrated vigor\nand agility while developing two new C++ based malware implants that we dubbed Kevin\nand James. Both relied on techniques and communication protocols from older malware\nused by the group and coined DanBot. Following our report on this activity and the\ncorresponding deployment of protection against the group’s newly found implants, we\nobserved recurring attempts by the attackers to deploy fresh samples that were not specified\nin our former report. Some of these samples revealed that the attackers have also made use\n\n\n-----\n\nof two new C2 domains, likely as means to bypass security mechanisms that mitigated\ncommunication to the already known domains. Such effort characterizes the group’s\npersistence in compromising a targeted organization, and shows that it has not ceased to\noperate after being discovered, a fact that can be reinforced through yet another cluster of\nactivity by the group that was recently exposed publicly. You can read more about our\n[findings in the ‘Lyceum group reborn’ article.](https://securelist.com/lyceum-group-reborn/104586/)\n\n## Southeast Asia and Korean Peninsula\n\nIn June, we observed the Lazarus group attacking the defense industry using the MATA\nmalware framework. Historically, Lazarus used MATA to attack various industries for\ncybercrime-like intentions: stealing customer databases and spreading ransomware.\nHowever, here we saw Lazarus using MATA for cyber-espionage purposes. The actor\ndelivered a Trojanized version of an application known to be used by their victim of choice,\nrepresenting a known characteristic of Lazarus. Executing this application starts a multistaged infection chain beginning with a downloader. This downloader fetches additional\nmalware from compromised C2 servers. We were able to acquire several MATA\ncomponents, including plugins. The MATA malware discovered in this campaign has evolved\ncompared to previous versions and uses a legitimate, stolen certificate to sign some of its\ncomponents. Through this research, we discovered a stronger connection between MATA\nand the Lazarus group, including the fact that the downloader malware fetching MATA\nmalware showed ties to TangoDaiwbo, which we had previously attributed to the Lazarus\ngroup.\n\nWe have also discovered Lazarus group campaigns using an updated DeathNote cluster.\nThe first involved an attack on a think tank in South Korea in June. The second was an\nattack on an IT asset monitoring solution vendor in May. Our investigation revealed\nindications that point to Lazarus building supply-chain attack capabilities. In one case, we\nfound that the infection chain stemmed from legitimate South Korean security software\nexecuting a malicious payload; and in the second case, the target was a company\ndeveloping asset monitoring solutions in Latvia, an atypical victim for Lazarus. The\nDeathNote malware cluster consisted of a slightly updated variant of BLINDINGCAN,\nmalware previously reported by the US CISA (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security\nAgency). BLINDINGCAN was also used to deliver a new variant of COPPERHEDGE, also\nreported in a CISA article. We had previously reported our initial finding of COPPERHEDGE\nin January 2020. As part of the infection chain, Lazarus used a downloader named Racket\nthat they signed using a stolen certificate. As a result of taking over the attacker’s\ninfrastructure with a local CERT, we had a chance to look into several C2 scripts associated\nwith the DeathNote cluster. The actor compromised vulnerable web servers and uploaded\nseveral scripts to filter and control the malicious implants on successfully breached victim\nmachines.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Kimsuky group is currently one of the most active APT groups. The threat actor is known\nfor focusing on cyber-espionage but occasionally conducts cyberattacks for financial gain.\nLike other APT groups that constitute a big umbrella, Kimsuky contains several clusters:\nBabyShark, AppleSeed, FlowerPower, and GoldDragon.\n\nEach cluster utilizes different methodologies and has different characteristics:\n\nBabyShark relies heavily on scripted malware and compromised web servers for C2\noperations;\nAppleSeed uses a unique backdoor named AppleSeed;\nFlowerPower uses PowerShell scripts and malicious Microsoft Office documents;\nGoldDragon is the oldest cluster, closest to the original Kimsuky malware.\n\nHowever, these clusters also show several overlaps. In particular, GoldDragon and\nFlowerPower share a strong connection in their C2 infrastructure. However, the other\nclusters also have a minor connection to the C2 infrastructure. We assess that BabyShark\nand AppleSeed are operating with different strategies.\n\nBack in May, we published a report about the freshly discovered activity of Andariel. In this\ncampaign, a broad spectrum of industries located in South Korea were targeted with custom\nransomware. During our research, we discovered that the actor was using two vectors to\ncompromise targets. The first was the use of weaponized Microsoft Office documents with\nmalicious macros. At the time of our original report, the second vector was still unknown but\nwe discovered artifacts containing the path of the tool ezPDF Reader, developed by a South\nKorean software company named Unidocs. We were missing clear evidence that the attack\nleveraged a vulnerability within this software, and to solve this mystery we decided to audit\nthe binary of this application. Our analysis of the software led us to discover a remote code\nexecution vulnerability in ezpdfwslauncher.exe that can be leveraged to break into computers\non the network with ezPDF Reader without any user interaction. We assess with high\nconfidence that the Andariel group used the same vulnerability in its attacks. After this\ndiscovery, we contacted the developers of Unidocs and shared the details of this vulnerability\nwith them. It was fixed as CVE-2021-26605.\n\nThis quarter we described activity associated with the Origami Elephant threat actor (aka\nDoNot team, APT-C-35, SECTOR02) observed from the beginning of 2020 and continuing\nthrough to this year. Origami Elephant continues to utilize the known Backconfig (aka Agent\nK1) and Simple Uploader components, but we have also identified lesser-known malware\nnamed VTYREI (aka BREEZESUGAR) used as a first-stage payload. Additionally, we\nobserved a unique technique of encoding the remote template used in the malicious\ndocuments that we have not seen utilized by other threat actors. Victimology is consistent\nwith past operations: the adversary continues to focus on the South Asia region with special\ninterest in government and military entities mainly in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri\nLanka.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also tracked Origami Elephant activity targeting Android mobile phones from the end of\n2020 up to the time of our report, picking up where we left off with last year’s report. We see\nthat the infrastructure is still active, communicating with the same malware we previously\nreported, albeit with a few changes in code obfuscation. The targeting remained the same as\nlast year, with victims located in the South Asian region: India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in\nparticular. The actor revised the infection chain compared with last year’s campaign. Instead\nof delivering a downloader stager, we observed the Android Trojan being directly delivered.\nThis is done via links to malicious landing pages or direct messages via some instant\nmessaging platform such as WhatsApp. The samples we analyzed mimicked various\napplications such as private messaging, VPN, and media services. Our report covered the\ncurrent state of Origami Elephant’s activities against Android devices and provided additional\nIoCs linked to both the latest and historical group activities. Scanning the internet with\navailable clues from our previous research, we are able to discover newly deployed hosts, in\nsome cases even before they become active.\n\n## Other interesting discoveries\n\nIn September, we provided an overview of the FinSpy PC implant. This covered not only the\nWindows version, but also Linux and macOS ones, which share the same internal structure\nand features. FinSpy is a notorious surveillance toolset that several NGOs have repeatedly\nreported being used against journalists, political dissidents and human rights activists.\nHistorically, its Windows implant was represented by a single-stage spyware installer. This\nversion was detected and researched several times up to 2018. Since then, we have\nobserved a decreasing detection rate for FinSpy for Windows. While the nature of this\nanomaly remained unknown, we began detecting some suspicious installer packages\nbackdoored with Metasploit stagers. We were unable to attribute these packages until the\nmiddle of 2019 when we found a host that served these installers among FinSpy Mobile\nimplants for Android. Over the course of our investigation, we found out that the backdoored\ninstallers are nothing more than first-stage implants that are used to download and deploy\nfurther payloads before the actual FinSpy Trojan. Apart from the Trojanized installers, we\nalso observed infections involving usage of a UEFI or MBR bootkit. While the MBR infection\nhas been known since at least 2014, details of the UEFI bootkit were only publicly revealed\nfor the first time in our article. We decided to share some of our unseen findings about the\n[actual state of FinSpy implants. You can read our public report here.](https://securelist.com/finspy-unseen-findings/104322/)\n\nTowards the end of Q3, we identified a previously unknown payload with advanced\ncapabilities, delivered using two infection chains to various government organizations and\ntelecoms companies in the Middle East. The payload makes use of a Windows kernel-mode\nrootkit to facilitate some of its activities and is capable of being persistently deployed through\nan MBR or a UEFI bootkit. Interestingly enough, some of the components observed in this\nattack have been formerly staged in memory by Slingshot agent on multiple occasions,\nwhereby Slingshot is a post-exploitation framework that we covered in several cases in the\n\n\n-----\n\npast (not to be confused with the Slingshot APT). It is mainly known for being a proprietary\ncommercial penetration testing toolkit officially designed for red team engagements.\nHowever, it’s not the first time that attackers appear to have taken advantage of it. One of our\nprevious reports from 2019 covering FruityArmor’s activity showed that the threat group used\nit to target organizations across multiple industries in the Middle East, possibly by leveraging\nan exploit in Skype as an infection vector. In a recent private intelligence report, we provided\na drill-down analysis of the newly discovered malicious toolkit that we observed in tandem\nwith Slingshot and how it was leveraged in clusters of activity in the wild. Most notably, we\noutlined some of the advanced features that are evident in the malware as well as its\nutilization in a particular long-standing activity against a high profile diplomatic target in Iraq.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nWhile the TTPs of some threat actors remain consistent over time, relying heavily on social\nengineering as a means of gaining a foothold in a target organization or compromising an\nindividual’s device, others refresh their toolsets and extend the scope of their activities. Our\nregular quarterly reviews are intended to highlight the key developments of APT groups.\n\nHere are the main trends that we’ve seen in Q3 2021:\n\nWe continue to see supply-chain attacks, including those of SmudgeX, DarkHalo and\nLazarus.\nIn this quarter we focused on researching and dismantling surveillance frameworks\nfollowing malicious activities we detected. These include FinSpy and the use of\nadvanced and highly capable payloads staged by a commercial post-exploitation\nframework known as Slingshot. These tools contain powerful covert capabilities, such\nas the use of bootkits for persistence. Bootkits remain an active component of some\nhigh profile APT attacks, notwithstanding various mitigations Microsoft has added to\nmake them much less easy to deploy on the Windows operating system.\nWe observed an abnormal spike in activity coming from what is widely known to be\nChinese-speaking threat groups this quarter, particularly when compared to the start of\nthe year. By contrast, we have seen a decrease in activity in the Middle East this\nquarter.\nSocial engineering remains a key method for initiating attacks; but also exploits\n(CloudComputating, Origami Elephant, Andariel), including exploiting firmware\nvulnerabilities.\nAs illustrated by the campaigns of various threat actors – including Gamaredon,\nCloudComputating, ExCone, Origami Elephant, ReconHellcat, SharpPanda – geopolitics continues to drive APT developments.\n\nAs always, we would note that our reports are the product of our visibility into the threat\nlandscape. However, it should be borne in mind that, while we strive to continually improve,\nthere is always the possibility that other sophisticated attacks may fly under our radar.\n\n\n-----\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Chinese-speaking cybercrime](https://securelist.com/tag/chinese-speaking-cybercrime/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Data theft](https://securelist.com/tag/data-theft/)\n[Lazarus](https://securelist.com/tag/lazarus/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Mobile Malware](https://securelist.com/tag/mobile-malware/)\n[Russian-speaking cybercrime](https://securelist.com/tag/russian-speaking-cybercrime/)\n[Spyware](https://securelist.com/tag/spyware/)\n[Supply-chain attack](https://securelist.com/tag/supply-chain-attack/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Website Hacks](https://securelist.com/tag/website-hacks/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nAPT trends report Q3 2021\n\nYour email address will not be published.
