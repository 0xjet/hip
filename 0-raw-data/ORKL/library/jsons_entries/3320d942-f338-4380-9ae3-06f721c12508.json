These groups continued their\n\n attacks on defense and aerospace companies in Europe and\n\n the US, as well as targeting cryptocurrency developers, think\n\n tanks, and NGOs. One such group, Kimsuky, began abusing\n\n Microsoft Management Console files, which are typically used by\n\n system administrators but can execute any Windows command.\n\n Additionally, several North Korea-aligned groups frequently\n\n misused popular cloud-based services, including Google Drive,\n\n Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox, Yandex Disk, pCloud, GitHub, and\n\n Bitbucket. For the first time, we saw an APT group – specifically\n\n ScarCruft – abusing Zoho cloud services.\n\n We detected Russia-aligned cyberespionage groups frequently\n\n targeting webmail servers such as Roundcube and Zimbra,\n\n usually with spearphishing emails that trigger known XSS\n\n vulnerabilities. Besides Sednit targeting governmental, academic,\n\n and defense-related entities worldwide, we identified another\n\n Russia-aligned group, which we named GreenCube, stealing\n\n email messages via XSS vulnerabilities in Roundcube. Other\n\n Russia-aligned groups continued to focus on Ukraine, with\n\n\n###### This report summarizes notable activities of selected advanced\n\n persistent threat (APT) groups that were documented by ESET\n\n researchers from April through September 2024. The highlighted\n\n operations are representative of the broader landscape of threats\n\n we investigated during this period. They illustrate the key trends\n\n and developments, and contain only a small fraction of the\n\n cybersecurity intelligence data provided to customers of ESET\n\n APT reports.\n\n During the monitored period, we observed a notable expansion\n\n in targeting by China-aligned MirrorFace. Typically focused\n\n on Japanese entities, it extended its operations to include a\n\n diplomatic organization in the European Union (EU) for the\n\n first time while continuing to prioritize its Japanese targets.\n\n Additionally, China-aligned APT groups have been relying\n\n increasingly on the open-source and multiplatform SoftEther\n\n VPN to maintain access to victims’ networks. We detected\n\n extensive use of SoftEther VPN by Flax Typhoon, observed\n\n Webworm switching from its full-featured backdoor to using\n\n the SoftEther VPN Bridge on machines of governmental\n\n\n###### organizations in the EU, and noticed GALLIUM deploying\n\n SoftEther VPN servers at telecommunications operators in Africa.\n\n We also observed indications that Iran-aligned groups might\n\n be leveraging their cybercapabilities to support diplomatic\n\n espionage and, potentially, kinetic operations. These groups\n\n compromised several financial services firms in Africa –\n\n a continent geopolitically important to Iran; conducted\n\n cyberespionage against Iraq and Azerbaijan, neighboring\n\n countries with which Iran has complex relationships; and\n\n increased their interest in the transportation sector in Israel.\n\n Despite this seemingly narrow geographical targeting, Iran\n aligned groups maintained a global focus, also pursuing\n\n diplomatic envoys in France and educational organizations in \n\n the United States.\n\n North Korea-aligned threat actors persisted in advancing the\n\n goals of their regime, which has been accused by the United\n\n Nations and South Korea of stealing funds – both traditional\n\n currencies and cryptocurrencies – to support its weapons of\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL 2024 - SEPTEMBER 2024 | 4 Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Iran     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n\n###### Gamaredon deploying large spearphishing campaigns while\n\n reworking its tools using and abusing the Telegram and Signal\n\n messaging apps.

Additionally, we detected Operation\n\n Texonto, a disinformation and psychological operation primarily\n\n aimed at demoralizing Ukrainians, also targeting Russian\n\n dissidents. We also analyzed the public hack-and-leak of the\n\n Polish Anti-Doping Agency, which we believe was compromised\n\n by an initial access broker who then shared access with the\n\n Belarus-aligned FrostyNeighbor APT group, the entity behind\n\n cyber-enabled disinformation campaigns critical of the North\n\n Atlantic Alliance. Finally, from analyzing an exploit found in the\n\n wild, we discovered a remote code execution vulnerability in\n\n WPS Office for Windows. We attribute the attack leveraging the\n\n exploit to the South Korea-aligned APT-C-60 group.\n\n\n###### ESET products protect our customers’ systems from the\n\n malicious activities described in this report.

Such a VPN bridge allows the attacker to\n\n establish direct communication between the attacker-controlled\n\n infrastructure and the victim’s local network, bypassing port filtering\n\n and accessing resources that might be blocked on the external router\n\n or firewall of the targeted organization.\n\n Among the other China-aligned groups that we have observed\n\n making regular use of SoftEther VPN, we have seen GALLIUM\n\n deploying SoftEther VPN servers (instead of bridges) against several\n\n compromised telecommunications operators in Africa along with its\n\n usual toolset. Flax Typhoon, which we mentioned in our previous APT\n\n activity report, continues to make extensive use of SoftEther VPN by\n\n deploying SoftEther Bridge on compromised machines and maintaining\n\n an infrastructure of SoftEther servers. Note that we also observed\n\n MirrorFace making use of SoftEther VPN at the end of 2023.\n\n MirrorFace expands its reach: Europe now  in the crosshairs\n\n In our APT Activity Report Q2 2023–Q3 2023, we documented\n\n continued MirrorFace (aka Earth Kasha) activity exclusively targeted\n\n toward Japanese entities. In a new development, this summer our team\n\n discovered that MirrorFace compromised a diplomatic organization in\n\n\n###### the EU. During this attack, the threat actor used as a lure the upcoming\n\n World Expo, which will be held in 2025 in Osaka, Japan. This shows that\n\n even considering this new geographic targeting, MirrorFace remains\n\n focused on Japan and events related to it. This is the first time we\n\n have detected MirrorFace targeting a European entity. Note that this\n\n January Trend Micro reported on MirrorFace targeting organizations\n\n in Taiwan and India.\n\n In this attack, MirrorFace sent the victim a spearphishing email\n\n containing a link to a ZIP archive named The EXPO Exhibition in\n\n Japan in 2025.zip hosted on OneDrive and containing a single\n\n LNK file named The EXPO Exhibition in Japan in 2025.docx.\n\n lnk, masquerading as a Word document. Upon opening, the LNK\n\n file displays a decoy Word document, shown in Figure 1, ultimately\n\n leading to the deployment of version 5.5.5 of the ANEL backdoor. ANEL\n\n disappeared from the scene around the end of 2018 or the start of 2019,\n\n and it was believed that LODEINFO had succeeded it, appearing later\n\n in 2019. Therefore, it is interesting to see ANEL resurfacing after almost\n\n five years. The next day, the attackers deployed their flagship backdoor\n\n HiddenFace (aka NOOPDOOR), which we documented at JSAC 2024.\n\n In the meantime, MirrorFace operations against its usual targets didn’t\n\n stop. We continued to see the threat actor targeting various Japanese\n\n organizations, such as a research institute and a political party. In all\n\n instances the threat actor tried to deploy HiddenFace along with other\n\n implants.\n\n\n###### Figure 1.

Proofpoint mentioned on Twitter\n\n (now known as X) that a nonprofit organization in the US was targeted\n\n using similar TTPs. Lastly, in August 2024, Kaspersky released another\n\n article about the group, digging deeper into its modus operandi.\n\n While some coverage has been done by our peers, we would like to add\n\n more information found during our own investigation of this threat actor.\n\n In February and July 2024, two CloudSorcerer samples were uploaded to\n\n VirusTotal with PE timestamps of 2022-05-23 09:36:17 and 2022-03-28\n\n 02:56:17, respectively. ESET researchers believe with high confidence that\n\n these dates were not tampered with and establish the activity of the group\n\n back to at least early 2022.\n\n Additionally, ESET researchers discovered a CloudSorcerer compromise\n\n chain similar to the one described by Proofpoint, whose decoy document,\n\n shown in Figure 2, suggests that the target is an individual in Ecuador.\n\n Figure 2.

In\n\n several instances, we have observed MuddyWater\n\n using internal network shares as intermediate C&C\n\n staging locations. MuddyWater operators are, often\n\n via command line access to systems, gathering\n\n reconnaissance info and dumping credentials to\n\n centralized network locations before exfiltrating that\n\n data from a single source. In one notable instance,\n\n MuddyWater operators spent 13 hours using various\n\n tools (e.g., MirrorDump, ProcDump, PowerSploit, and\n\n Impersonate) to attempt dumping LSASS process\n\n memory but without any apparent success. This\n\n shift to lateral movement likely indicates a better\n\n understanding of network defense capabilities and a\n\n maturing offensive cybercapability.\n\n\n###### From cyber-support to diplomatic and kinetic operations\n\n Examining the victimology of the network in which\n\n MuddyWater has been focused, we observed\n\n indications that Iran-aligned groups, and MuddyWater\n\n specifically, may be in the process of using their\n\n cybercapabilities to support diplomatic and kinetic\n\n operations. Iran has made no secret of the fact that its\n\n interests in Africa and the continent's natural resources\n\n are key components of its international policies. To that\n\n end, Iran-aligned groups spent significant time gaining\n\n access to, and moving laterally in, several financial\n\n services firms in Kenya and Zambia, and an unidentified\n\n victim in Ghana.\n\n As for support or preparation for kinetic action, we\n\n have observed potential indicators that some Iran\n aligned groups may be gathering information to\n\n support military activities. A transportation company\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL 2024 - SEPTEMBER 2024 | 12 Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Iran     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n\n###### in Israel was targeted by MuddyWater, with many hours spent deploying\n\n various tools within the organization. Operators spent time moving\n\n laterally, using internal network shares, and gathering credentials and other\n\n information for exfiltration. Such activity, while not uncommon for many\n\n groups, is somewhat unusual for MuddyWater, indicating an increased\n\n interest in the transportation vertical. In light of the current tensions and\n\n conflicts in the Middle East, it makes sense that Iran-aligned groups would\n\n look to target critical industries like transportation.\n\n Continued interest in being the intrusive neighbor\n\n Separately, OilRig subgroup BladedFeline conducted cyberespionage\n\n against Iran’s neighbors, with a high rate of malware development and\n\n deployment. Regional and national governmental organizations in Iraq,\n\n\n###### activities in Africa and Azerbaijan were somewhat less sophisticated in\n\n tooling and modus operandi, the Ballistic Bobcat activities were more so.\n\n Ballistic Bobcat attempted to circumvent security software, such as EDR,\n\n by injecting malicious code into innocuous processes and using multiple\n\n modules to evade notice. This indicates that the targets are highly valuable\n\n to Iranian interests and, when coupled with credential theft, point to a\n\n long-term plan and additional cyberincursions.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL 2024 - SEPTEMBER 2024 | 13 Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Iran     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n## North Korea\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL 2024 - SEPTEMBER 2024 | 14 Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Iran     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n Lazarus Kimsuky ScarCruft Citrine Sleet\n\n##### Summary of North Korea-aligned APT group activity\n\n###### 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n\n###### In this reporting period, we noted ongoing persistent\n\n efforts from North Korea-aligned groups to infiltrate\n\n critical sectors, gather intelligence, and exploit\n\n vulnerabilities for both financial gain and strategic\n\n advantage. Lazarus continued its espionage efforts,\n\n known as Operation DreamJob, by targeting defense\n\n and aerospace companies both in Europe and the\n\n US. Lazarus also targeted developers working with\n\n cryptocurrencies by using fake job offers and setting\n\n up a fake cryptocurrency platform. Kimsuky was also\n\n quite active in the reporting period, targeting mostly\n\n think tanks, NGOs, and North Korea experts – under\n\n the guise of requests for interview, thesis advisory, or\n\n requests for a public presentations. On the other hand,\n\n we noticed limited activities from other North Korea\n aligned groups, like Konni and ScarCruft.\n\n Abusing cloud services\n\n One of the noteworthy trends in this period is the\n\n abuse of popular cloud-based services. Network\n\n\n###### traffic to these services is less likely to be detected\n\n as anomalous, giving attackers a small window of\n\n opportunity to stay undetected in the corporate\n\n environment.\n\n Specifically, Kimsuky frequently abused Google Drive\n\n and Microsoft OneDrive to host decoy documents\n\n and as C&C servers. For data exfiltration, Kimsuky\n\n used Dropbox accounts. Interestingly, ScarCruft uses\n\n various cloud services for its backdoors. We detected\n\n RokRAT instances using Yandex Disk and pCloud as\n\n C&C servers, and BirdCall – a publicly undocumented\n\n backdoor – abusing Zoho WorkDrive and pCloud. This\n\n is the first time we have seen Zoho cloud services\n\n being abused by an APT group.\n\n We also saw abuse of code and package repositories\n\n for deploying initial malware masked as coding projects\n\n and hiring challenges. We observed Lazarus using\n\n GitHub and Bitbucket to share trojanized projects with\n\n its victims. We also observed a subgroup of Lazarus,\n\n\n###### Technology\n\n Education\n\n Defense\n\n Nonprofit\n\n Government\n\n Information and cultural industries\n\n Sectors targeted by North Korea-aligned APT groups\n\n Phishing for information (1598)\n\n Spearphishing link (T1566.002)\n\n Spearphishing attachment (T1566.001)\n\n\n###### 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n\n###### Initial access techniques used by North Korea-aligned APT groups (with MITRE ATT&CK IDs)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL 2024 - SEPTEMBER 2024 | 15 Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Iran     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n\n###### which we named Moonstone, uploading trojanized\n\n packages to the npm registry with a similar goal.\n\n We are pleased to be able to report that most service\n\n providers are reacting quickly and promptly terminate\n\n the abused accounts.\n\n Building relationships before  the attack\n\n Another distinctive feature of many attacks that we\n\n attribute to North Korea-aligned groups is the gradual\n\n building up of the relationship with the victim. Both\n\n Lazarus and Kimsuky used fake job offers to approach\n\n the targeted individuals. Only after the victim responds\n\n and a relationship is established, is a malicious package\n\n sent to the victim.\n\n For example, we observed Lazarus’s Operation\n\n DreamJob cluster focus on defense contractors and\n\n media companies in Europe and Asia. It used fake job\n\n offers for desirable positions at large companies (like\n\n Airbus or BAE Systems) and delivered trojanized PDF\n\n viewers along with decoy PDF documents, as well as\n\n many new malicious tools. Figure 3 shows an example\n\n of such a decoy PDF.\n\n We also identified a new cluster of Lazarus activity\n\n that we’ve named DeceptiveDevelopment, targeting\n\n freelance developers around the world with the\n\n aim of cryptocurrency theft. To this end, the\n\n\n###### attackers impersonated recruiters on professional\n\n networks and work platforms, distributing trojanized\n\n codebases under the guise of job assignments and\n\n hiring challenges, or distributing trojanized remote\n\n conferencing tools. They focused heavily on the theft\n\n of cryptocurrency wallets and stored login information\n\n using simple, yet effective, multiplatform malware\n\n named BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret.\n\n Speaking of cryptocurrency theft, we also observed\n\n the Citrine Sleet threat actor setting up a fake\n\n cryptocurrency trading and investment platform\n\n in order to distribute a trojanized cryptocurrency\n\n trading app to compromise its victims and steal\n\n cryptocurrency. We assume the victims were lured via\n\n social networks and targeted communications by the\n\n attacker pretending to advertise the platform.\n\n Another approach used mostly by Kimsuky is a request\n\n for a media interview or giving a presentation. These\n\n attacks mostly target North Korea experts working\n\n for NGOs, and researchers in academic circles whose\n\n research is related to the Korean peninsula. We\n\n observed lure emails in both English and Korean,\n\n praising the target’s expertise and asking for help. Once\n\n the relationship is established, a malicious package is\n\n delivered, usually disguised as a list of questions that\n\n should be answered before the event.\n\n\n###### Figure 3.

MSC files are\n\n normally used by system administrators to perform tasks, like managing\n\n Windows users or system policies. However, MSC files are not limited to\n\n performing just system administration tasks – they can be used to run any\n\n Windows command. It’s also possible to change the icon of an MSC file, so\n\n that it resembles a PDF or Word document – making it more likely that a\n\n victim will be successfully deceived.\n\n The first publicly documented use of malicious MSC files was reported by\n\n Genians in May 2024. In that case, Kimsuky targeted individuals in South\n\n Korea and Japan with MSC files masquerading as essays or materials for\n\n a media interview. A certain amount of social engineering is required\n\n to persuade the victim to open the MSC file, ignore a warning message\n\n displayed by Windows, and then click on the Open link. However, the\n\n previously established relationship between the attacker and the victim\n\n makes this task easier.\n\n Since then, we have observed multiple attacks by Kimsuky, targeting\n\n mostly Western academics and NGOs. For example, in September 2024 we\n\n\n###### detected a malicious MSC file that looks like an interview request from The\n\n Wall Street Journal (see Figure 4).\n\n Other threat actors quickly recognized the potential of MSC files: we have\n\n observed malicious MSC files being used by China-aligned Mustang Panda,\n\n and by parties involved in the Russia–Ukraine conflict.\n\n\n###### Figure 4.

These adversaries have predominantly relied\n\n on spearphishing emails to gain initial access. However,\n\n we have also observed a growing focus on exploiting\n\n webmail servers by using one-day vulnerabilities,\n\n broadening their attack surface.\n\n An increase in XSS spearphishing attacks against Zimbra and Roundcube\n\n Russia-aligned cyberespionage groups have frequently\n\n targeted webmail servers such as Roundcube and\n\n Zimbra. The initial access vector for such attacks\n\n is usually a spearphishing email, which triggers a\n\n known XSS vulnerability and enables the execution\n\n of arbitrary JavaScript payloads. Those payloads can\n\n\n###### access webmail users’ data; therefore the main goal is\n\n to steal emails or add persistent forwarding rules. It is\n\n very common for such webmail servers to be updated\n\n infrequently.\n\n We discovered new Sednit spearphishing waves,\n\n which are part of the already known Operation\n\n RoundPress campaign directed against Roundcube\n\n webmail servers. In the past several months,\n\n we observed such spearphishing waves against\n\n governmental, academic, and defense-related entities\n\n in Cameroon, Cyprus, Ecuador, Indonesia, Romania,\n\n and Ukraine. Sednit used a wide range of lures, from\n\n legitimate news articles to a commercial brochure for\n\n thermal optics, as shown in Figure 5.\n\n We identified another Russia-aligned group, which\n\n we named GreenCube, that has been active since at\n\n least 2022. This group specializes in credential-stealing\n\n spearphishing campaigns and stealing email messages\n\n via XSS vulnerabilities in Roundcube. From 2022\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL 2024 - SEPTEMBER 2024 | 19 Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Iran     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n\n###### organizations, including energy, water, and heat supply\n\n enterprises, in ten regions of Ukraine.\n\n During this activity, Sandworm used a Windows\n\n backdoor, which we track under the name WrongSens\n\n (CERT-UA named it QUEUESEED). Additionally,\n\n Sandworm used custom Linux malware named\n\n LOADGRIP and BIASBOAT. After performing an in\n depth analysis of LOADGRIP and BIASBOAT samples,\n\n we concluded that they are advanced Linux malware,\n\n created by developers with a good understanding of\n\n Linux internals. This malware is designed to work only\n\n on targeted machines, using their machine-specific IDs\n\n for payload decryption.\n\n Researchers from WithSecure independently\n\n discovered and analyzed the WrongSens backdoor,\n\n which they named Kapeka.\n\n Operation Texonto\n\n In February 2024, we published a blogpost about a\n\n disinformation and psychological operation (PSYOP)\n\n campaign we named Operation Texonto. This\n\n campaign primarily aims to raise doubts in the minds\n\n of Ukrainians and Ukrainian speakers abroad; however,\n\n we also observed a campaign targeting Russian\n\n dissidents. Attackers primarily use email as the main\n\n distribution method for their PSYOP messages.\n\n In September 2024, we detected an Operation Texonto\n\n email sent from DCHC @ headlineinteresting[.]pro,\n\n\n###### Figure 5. Decoy email, which triggers an XSS vulnerability in the background\n\n\n###### During this period, Gamaredon improved already\n\n existing malicious tools and deployed new ones.\n\n Specifically, in August 2024 we discovered a new\n\n PowerShell tool, which we named PteroGraphin; it is\n\n a persistent downloader that delivers an encrypted\n\n payload via telegra.ph – the Telegram publishing\n\n platform. In addition, Gamaredon significantly\n\n reworked one of its backdoors written in PowerShell\n\n – PteroPSDoor – making it stealthier by adding\n\n multiple layers of obfuscation and hiding its parts in\n\n the Windows registry. Finally, Gamaredon improved its\n\n data exfiltration tool for Signal’s desktop application\n\n – PteroSig. This adjustment was made due to recent\n\n changes in Signal Desktop. Now PteroSig is able to\n\n parse and decrypt the DPAPI-protected key used\n\n by the Signal application, allowing PteroSig to again\n\n decrypt and exfiltrate data from Signal.\n\n In July 2024, we discovered an unusual payload\n\n deployed by Gamaredon; it merely opens a Telegram\n\n channel named Хранители Одессы (translation:\n\n Guardians of Odessa) in the default browser. This\n\n channel, which can be found at https ://t[.]me/s/\n\n hraniteli_odessi, is full of Russian propaganda\n\n focused on the Odessa region.\n\n Sandworm\n\n In April 2024, CERT-UA published a notification about\n\n disrupted Sandworm group activity. According to\n\n the notification, Sandworm targeted about twenty\n\n\n###### to 2024, GreenCube has been repeatedly targeting\n\n governmental and defense-related organizations\n\n in Greece, Poland, Serbia, and Ukraine. GreenCube\n\n overlaps with a cluster tracked by CERT-UA as\n\n UAC-0102 (see this first notification and this second\n\n notification) and with a cluster tracked by Mandiant\n\n as UNC3707.\n\n We observed four different types of payloads that\n\n GreenCube can deploy once XSS exploitation has been\n\n successful: adding a Sieve rule to forward incoming\n\n emails, stealing webmail credentials, exfiltrating\n\n account metadata, and exfiltrating email messages.\n\n\n###### Russia-Ukraine war\n\n Gamaredon\n\n Gamaredon continues to be the most active APT group\n\n targeting Ukraine. Recently, we published a detailed\n\n white paper thoroughly describing the TTPs used by\n\n this group in 2022–2023. Most of the mentioned TTPs\n\n haven’t changed significantly in 2024. For example, in\n\n the past few months, we detected a number of large\n\n spearphishing campaigns with attachments utilizing\n\n HTML smuggling – a typical initial compromise vector\n\n for Gamaredon.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL 2024 - SEPTEMBER 2024 | 20 Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Iran     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n likely targeting individuals residing in the Sumy region of Ukraine.

In this section, we highlight a recent\n\n FrostyNeighbor campaign in Poland, a Linux toolset\n\n probably used to target an ISP in Yemen, and the\n\n exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability in WPS Office\n\n for Windows by APT-C-60.\n\n FrostyNeighbor\n\n FrostyNeighbor, also known as UNC1151, is a Belarus\n aligned threat group that performs influence and\n\n disinformation campaigns (like the Ghostwriter\n\n information operations), but has also compromised\n\n a variety of governmental and private sector entities,\n\n with a focus on Ukraine, Poland, and Lithuania.\n\n FrostyNeighbor compromised the Polish Anti-Doping\n\n Agency (POLADA), and documents were stolen\n\n in a hack-and-leak operation in July 2024, then\n\n made available by the Beregini hacking group via its\n\n Telegram channel https ://t[.]me/hackberegini in\n\n August 2024. As shown in Figure 6, the post contains\n\n screenshots of stolen documents, a video showing\n\n access to the WordPress admin dashboard of the\n\n\n###### agency website (antidoping[.]pl), and links to\n\n download archives containing the stolen data.\n\n Machine translation of the post:\n\n\n###### The leaked documents contained, among other things,\n\n athletes’ personal data, medical data, failed doping\n\n controls, investigations of illegal chemical laboratories,\n\n and a plethora of plaintext passwords saved within\n\n text and Microsoft Excel documents.\n\n After analyzing the compromise chain and links found\n\n to potential compromises that were not linked with\n\n FrostyNeighbor, we think that the initial compromise\n\n was done by an initial access broker who made\n\n some opportunistic hacks and shared access with\n\n FrostyNeighbor when the victim was interesting or\n\n a high-value target. At a later stage, the Beregini\n\n group got access to the stolen documents and, in\n\n a disinformation effort, leaked them to discredit\n\n authorities.\n\n\n###### Figure 6.

Specifically, it contains modified versions of publicly available\n\n Linux tools, such as Tiny SHell and Srelay, and custom malware, such as\n\n SLAPSTICK and STEELCORGI. Additionally, we discovered several other\n\n Linux binaries uploaded from Yemen within a close time frame, leading us\n\n to believe that they are probably related to the discovered activity. It should\n\n be noted that this toolset matches that publicly described by Mandiant as\n\n part of the activity of UNC1945 and UNC2891.\n\n In addition to the listed malware families, the archive contains an\n\n obfuscated shell script named hactrl.txt. This shell script establishes a\n\n reverse SSH tunnel at specific times of the day. The attackers disguised the\n\n SSH private key file by using the location /opt/VRTSvcs/bin/hacoconfig,\n\n which suggests that Veritas Cluster Server is likely the targeted system.\n\n We believe with medium confidence that a telecommunications company\n\n in Yemen was targeted. Our assessment is based on some other Yemeni\n\n users who uploaded related malicious files and also uploaded legitimate\n\n binaries belonging to software used in the telecommunications industry.\n\n Specifically, a user from Yemen who uploaded related malware samples\n\n also uploaded the file _mh_av.txt[2], which is a non-malicious Linux binary\n\n from NewStart Carrier-Grade Server Linux by Guangdong ZTE NewStart\n\n Technology Co., Ltd.\n\n At this point, we are unable to determine the specific objectives of\n\n the threat actor, whether being a financially motivated operation or\n\n cyberespionage.\n\n1 SHA-256: 0012C49FAC5EAB8FF1BCB7EFAB62CB1D29E6CCEA2F272C968CA7C4BC2FE011B7\n\n2 SHA-256: AA6F6A50271A1D63896971C2759A619E651D94D475B504200C1A0F2E5F623EFF\n\n3 SHA-256: 6174276F94219BC386BDC628CA18EAEC261998B7BD03077562FE93C268B42446\n\n\n###### WPS Office for Windows vulnerability – APT-C-60\n\n ESET researchers discovered a code execution vulnerability in WPS Office\n\n for Windows (CVE-2024-7262), as it was being exploited in the wild by\n\n APT-C-60, a South Korea-aligned cyberespionage group. WPS Office is an\n\n “Office Suite for Docs, Sheets, Slides and PDFs” and has over 500 million\n\n active users worldwide, which makes it a good target to reach a substantial\n\n number of individuals.\n\n Upon analyzing the root cause, we subsequently discovered another way to\n\n exploit the faulty code (CVE-2024-7263). Following a coordinated disclosure\n\n process, we shared our findings with Kingsoft. Both vulnerabilities were\n\n silently patched around the end of May 2024.\n\n The exploit was delivered via a malicious document[3] that is an MHTML\n\n export of the commonly used XLS spreadsheet format. However, this\n\n document contains a specially crafted and hidden hyperlink, designed\n\n to trigger the execution of an arbitrary DLL if clicked on when using the\n\n WPS Spreadsheet application. The rather unconventional MHTML file\n\n format allows a file to be downloaded as soon as the document is opened;\n\n therefore, leveraging this technique while exploiting the vulnerability\n\n provides remote code execution.\n\n A root cause analysis of these vulnerabilities can be found on our blog\n\n WeLiveSecurity.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL 2024 - SEPTEMBER 2024 | 24\n Executive summary     Attackers and targets     China     Iran     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n### About ESET\n\n\n###### ESET® provides cutting-edge digital security to prevent attacks before\n\n they happen.
