These terms are used differently in different communities.\n\n\n-----\n\n****** The ICS Cyber Kill Chain breaks intrusions into Stage 1 and Stage 2 operations. Stage 1 are IT network compromises where the adversary\nappears to have a goal of getting into the ICS/OT networks of the company but has not achieved this yet. Stage 2 operations are those\nwhere the adversary has gained access to ICS/OT networks. At the completion of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain an adversary conducts disruptive or\n[destructive operations. The paper can be found here.](https://www.sans.org/white-papers/36297)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n#### IN THE HEADLINES\n\n\n###### When OT Cyber Disruption Leads to Panic and Economic Shutdown\n\n\n-----\n\n#### IN THE HEADLINES\n\n\n###### When Ransomware Attacks Endanger the Nation’s Food Supply\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n#### IN THE HEADLINES\n\n\n###### Oldsmar Demonstrates the Risk to Water Systems\n\n\n-----\n\n#### IN THE HEADLINES\n\n\n**In mid-September 2021, the ransomware group**\n**BlackMatter attacked New Cooperative, an association**\n**of Iowa corn and soybean farmers, and demanded a $5.9**\n**million ransom payment for a decryptor. The attack**\n**was more evidence that infrastructure and the U.S. food**\n**supply chain had become targets. New Cooperative**\n**claimed that the breached software governed the feeding**\n**schedules of 11 million farm animals and 40 percent of**\n**their grain production. Blackmatter, the ransomware**\n**group previously known as Darkside, had claimed that**\n**they would “avoid targeting critical infrastructure,” yet**\n**their actions did not reflect their public statements.**\n\nNew Cooperative, its 60+ locations, and other U.S.\nfarming and grain co-ops found themselves the target\nof ransomware groups. Dark web forums suggested that\nadversaries had exfiltrated 1000 GB of New Cooperative’s\ndata; however, Dragos could not identify that exfiltration\nof data from New Cooperative’s network had occurred as\nthe adversary claimed. On September 23, the Minnesotabased Crystal Valley Cooperative announced it was also hit\nwith ransomware, which forced the company offline and\ndisrupted its business operations.\n\nLater in October, the ransomware group BlackByte allegedly\nattacked a second Iowa cooperative called Farmer’s\nCooperative Elevator Co. The threat group threatened to\nrelease 100 gigabytes of data that included financial, sales,\nand accounting information if the ransom was not paid.\n\nHistorically, it is unusual for adversaries to target farmer\nco-ops. This series of attacks illustrates that industrial\ntargets like farmer co-ops, once thought of as unlikely\nvictims, can become prime targets without notice. U.S.\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack has urged cooperatives\nto strengthen their defenses against cyber attacks to avoid\ndisruptions to the nation’s harvest.\n\n\n###### When the U.S. Food Supply Chain Became a Target\n\n\n-----\n\n###### SECTION ONE\n\n 2021 Threat Activity\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Key Updates on Activity Groups\n\n During 2021, cyber risk to industrial sectors grew and accelerated, largely led by ransomware. Dragos emphasizes the importance of understanding how adversaries gain access and steal information to better prepare for threats in the future. Adversaries tend to build their operations and capabilities methodically over time; their previous efforts often determine their future success.\n\n Dragos tracks threats, also identified as activity groups, which show the intent, opportunity, or capability of impacting industrial operations. Some of these threats have shown the intent and capability to disrupt operations and even cause destructive effects. These threats may be in the early stages of their journey, and have only shown the intent to target industrial organizations by attempting to gain access to ICS/OT networks or collecting organizational information. \n\n Dragos tracks a number of groups that have targeted industrial networks, but do not show the intention of disrupting them—this is much more common in reality than is publicly reported. Adversaries may do this for intellectual property theft, capability development for future attacks, or simply gaining and maintaining access for future undetermined needs. In some cases, adversaries gain access to the IT networks of an organization or its supply chain to get information about the ICS of the target. As an example, engineering drawings are useful in both intellectual property theft and disruptive capability development but would not usually be stored in the ICS networks of the company. These drawings would more likely be stored in the IT networks of that company’s integrator. Although not every compromise will relate to an impact today, many can inform the attacks of the future.\n\n Currently, Dragos tracks 18 worldwide threat groups, with three of the newest groups discovered during 2021. Two of the new Activity Groups, KOSTOVITE and ERYTHRITE, demonstrate Stage 2 ICS Cyber Kill Chain[1] intrusions with a focus on access operations and data theft over disruption. This shows that adversaries are willing to spend time, effort, and resources targeting, compromising, and harvesting information from ICS/OT environments for future purposes.\n\n**1** [SANS ICS Cyber Kill Chain](https://icscsi.org/library/Documents/White_Papers/SANS%20-%20ICS%20Cyber%20Kill%20Chain.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Updates on Previously Known Activity Groups\n\n###### Throughout 2020, the Activity Groups identified prior to 2021 remained active against industrial organizations. While already covered in previous Year in Review reports, the following key activities occurred in 2021 that are worth noting:\n\n**STIBNITE**\nFrom late 2019 through early 2020, the Activity Group STIBNITE emerged with\nits first phase of Stage 1 industrial infrastructure intrusions. STIBNITE initially **STIBNITE**\nfocused on IT intrusion and information gathering on wind turbine companies\nthat generate electric power in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is near the Caucasus **Target Geography**\nregion, an area that is a significant source of energy for Europe. Azerbaijan\n\nIn February 2021, STIBNITE targeted Azerbaijani environmental science, **Victimology**\ntechnology, and industrial engineering experts, researchers, and practitioners Electricity, Wind,\ninterested in technical conferences. STIBNITE sent victims spear-phishing Renewable Energy\nemails about such events as a first lure and attempt at installing a new version\nof PoetRAT written in .NET. A month later, STIBNITE used a State Oil Company **Malware**\nof the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) spear-phishing lure targeting the Azerbaijan PoetRAT\nMinistry of Ecology and Natural Resources. The STIBNITE spear-phishing\nemails all contained a downloadable document with a macro that when\nexecuted would drop a new version of PoetRAT written in Python.\n\nSTIBNITE continues to target entities in Azerbaijan and uses infrastructure overlapping with its previous\nintrusions to make updates to PoetRAT. There does not appear to be motivation or active operations that\nshould be of concern to global ICS owners outside of Azerbaijan, although global operators can learn from\nthe tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of STIBNITE to enhance their defenses against adversaries\nleveraging similar tactics. However, STIBNITE has demonstrated an explicit and calculated interest in\ntargeting Azerbaijani wind generation capabilities while it is still in its infancy. In addition, STIBNITE has\nshown a repeated interest in targeting entities related to Azerbaijani renewable energy projects. It is likely\nSTIBNITE will gain initial access to these projects as they reach operational maturation by masquerading\nas related and trusted entities, which STIBNITE has demonstrated in the past.\n\n**Dragos assesses with moderate confidence that Azerbaijani asset owners and**\n**operators related to renewable energy interests should anticipate activities from**\n**STIBNITE as more renewable asset projects reach commercial operation in the future.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**WASSONITE**\nIn late October 2019, Dragos identified the adversary WASSONITE targeting\nthe Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) nuclear facility in India. **WASSONITE**\nSubsequent intelligence research combined with public announcements\nfrom KKNPP confirmed that adversaries had breached its IT network. In **Target Geography**\naddition, Dragos identified a pattern of activity associated with the same India, Japan, Korea\ntactics, tools, and techniques spanning multiple ICS entities that included\nelectric generation, nuclear energy, manufacturing, and space-centric **Victimology**\nresearch sectors. Electricity, Nuclear,\n\n###### Manufacturing,\n\nDragos has determined that WASSONITE has operated since at least Space research\n2018 with limited technical overlaps to the cluster of activity tracked\nas Kimsuky.[2,3] The WASSONITE activity group leverages spear phishing **Malware**\nas their initial infection vector. WASSONITE uses malware with DTrack variant\ncustomization for specific internal networks in their targeting of ICS\nverticals. WASSONITE’s geographic targeting has focused on Asian\nentities, including India and possibly Japan and South Korea. WASSONITE\noperations represent Stage 1 of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain intrusions. Intrusion activity consisted\nof known malware leveraged in enterprise systems used for data theft and reconnaissance,\nknown credential harvesting tools, and use of Windows system tools for file transfer and lateral\nmovement.\n\nOn April 17, 2020, Dragos identified a variant of DTrack malware with technical overlaps to\npreviously observed samples associated with WASSONITE. This DTrack variant included specific\nhardcoded ports and internal IP addresses targeting the Fujitsu Systemwalker distributed\ncomputing and data center management software.\n\nIn July 2021, Dragos discovered multiple victims in the oil & gas, electric, and component\nmanufacturing industries communicating with a WASSONITE command and control server (C2)\nserver associated with the Appleseed backdoor. The Appleseed backdoor is a multi-component\nbackdoor that can take screenshots, log keystrokes, and collect removable media information and\nspecific victim files. It can also upload, download, and execute follow-on commands from the C2\nserver.[4,5]\n\nWhile it is unknown if the Appleseed backdoor was deployed within an OT environment, the\nscreenshot functionality is valuable for use against the victim’s system operator or Human\nMachine Interface (HMI) as a form of recon or data exfiltration to further understand the industrial\nprocess.\n\n**Dragos assesses that WASSONITE will continue to target ICS entities in the electric**\n**generation, nuclear energy, manufacturing, and space-centric research sectors with**\n**their demonstrated intent and capabilities, with subsequent access sufficient in many cases to**\n**execute follow-on attacks.**\n\n**2** [The Lazarus Constellation – Lexfo; 3 Kimsuky King of Spearphishing – Virus Bulletin; 4 Operation MUZABI – KISA; 5 Kimsuky’s Appleseed Backdoor – Malwarebytes Labs](https://blog.lexfo.fr/ressources/Lexfo-WhitePaper-The_Lazarus_Constellation.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n**KAMACITE**\nSince 2014, the activity group KAMACITE has had a long-running and\nconsistent pattern of targeting critical infrastructure and industrial **KAMACITE**\nverticals. KAMACITE has repeatedly targeted U.S. electric utilities, oil and\ngas, and other industrial firms since as early as 2017 and has had additional **Target Geography**\noperations throughout Europe and North America. KAMACITE also has United States,\nextensive activity targeting the Ukraine electricity sector. Ukraine, and other\n\n###### parts of Europe\n\nKAMACITE has technical overlaps with the group identified as Sandworm,\nwhich multiple government and third-party entities have linked to the **Victimology**\nMain Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Electricity, Oil &\nRussian Federation, abbreviated as G.R.U. and commonly known as GRU.[6] Gas, Industrial\n\nMany aspects of KAMACITE’s operations and tradecraft have remained **Malware**\nremarkably similar during the past six years. Dragos assesses that BLACKENERGY 2/3,\nKAMACITE serves as ELECTRUM’s access team, focusing on gaining GREYENERGY\nfootholds in target networks. Although KAMACITE has not directly caused\nan ICS disruptive event according to Dragos analysis, the group is responsible\nfor enabling other adversaries, such as ELECTRUM, to deliver ICS-specific\ndisruption with access operations.\n\nDragos has determined that KAMACITE has facilitated ICS-specific operations leveraging its\nBLACKENERGY2 malware. BLACKENERGY malware first emerged in 2007 and subsequently\ninspired or provided the foundation for three malware families: BLACKENERGY2, BLACKENERGY3,\nand GREYENERGY. Of these, BLACKENERGY2 is one of a few malware samples to be publicly\nidentified with built-in ICS capability. Though BLACKENERGY2 had ICS capabilities it was\nBLACKENERGY3 which served as the access tool to the IT networks that allowed the adversary to\npivot to OT networks and orchestrate the 2015 cyber attack on Ukraine’s electric system.\n\nIn 2021, Dragos uncovered two new GREYENERGY dropper variants in the wild: one in March of 2021,\nand another in August 2021.\n\n**Dragos’s continual discovery of new GREYENERGY files in the wild demonstrates**\n**that KAMACITE continues its development of GREYENERGY to further its operations.**\n**KAMACITE may be using all GREYENERGY components in conjunction with other actions and tools**\n**to facilitate more disruptive ICS attacks. ICS asset owners and defenders should view all components**\n**of GREYENERGY as possible mechanisms with the ability to enable an ICS-focused attack.**\n\n**6** [AG-2021-01: KAMACITE](https://portal.dragos.com/#/products/AG-2021-01)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2021’s New Activity Groups\n\n###### KOSTOVITE\n\n PETROVITE\n\n ERYTHRITE\n\n\n-----\n\n###### KOSTOVITE\n\n\nAn energy organization was compromised and engaged\nthe Dragos incident response team. Dragos deployed a\nteam of investigators to analyze the intrusion and\ndetermined that the organization was not an\nopportunistic target. This narrative is the background\nbehind the investigation and successful remediation\nand recovery following the purposefully executed\nintrusion by the activity group Dragos now tracks as\n**KOSTOVITE.**\n\nThe Dragos investigation for KOSTOVITE’s target\nshowed that KOSTOVITE reached Stage 2 of ICS Kill\nChain capabilities with confirmed access into the OT\nnetworks and devices. In early 2021, when KOSTOVITE\ncompromised the perimeter of the firm’s ICS/OT\nnetwork and devices, it exploited a vulnerability in their\nremote access solution. This is consistent with\nKOSTOVITE’s known tactics of also leveraging zero-day\nvulnerabilities against VPN solutions including Ivanti\nConnect Secure, formerly known as Pulse Secure.\nKOSTOVITE is an adversary with significant tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTP) and technical overlaps\nwith the threat group known as UNC2630[7]. UNC2630 is a\ngroup with a history of access operations and data theft\nand is associated with the use of 12 malware families\ndeployed exclusively on Ivanti VPN appliances.\n\n\n**Industries**\n###### Renewable Energy\n\n**ICS Cyber Kill Chain**\n###### Stage 2, Develop\n\n\n**Malware type**\n###### Highly customized webshells\n\n Organic target network Living Off the Land\n\n\n###### Highly customized webshells\n\n Organic target network Living Off the Land\n\n\n###### Stage 2, Develop\n\n\n###### MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise and ICS\n\n\n###### Renewable Energy\n\n\n**T0884**\n\n**T0819**\n\n**T1505**\n\n**T0859**\n\n\nConnection Proxy\n\nExploit Public-Facing Application\n\nServer Software Component: Web Shell\n\n\nKOSTOVITE uses dedicated operational relay\ninfrastructure against targets to obfuscate the origin of\nits activities to obtain legitimate account credentials.\nWith this, KOSTOVITE then uses the stolen account\ninformation to move laterally and gain access to the OT\nenvironments. Once past the perimeter ingress,\nKOSTOVITE used only what is referred to as the target’s\norganic infrastructure, meaning no tools or code from\noutside the target’s network, to move laterally across\ntarget infrastructure.\n\n**7** [Re Checking Your Pulse: Updates on Chinese APT Actors](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/updates-on-chinese-apt-compromising-pulse-secure-vpn-devices) Compromising Pulse Secure VPN Devices Mandiant\n\n\n**TA0006**\n\n**T0817**\n\n**T1555**\n\n**T0822**\n\n**T1078**\n\n**T1078**\n\n**T1078**\n\n\n**T0806**\n\n**T0858**\n\n\n**T0840**\n\n**T0888**\n\n**T1614**\n\n**T1602**\n\n**T0807**\n\n**T1021**\n\n**T1021**\n\n\nValid Accounts\n\nCredential Access\n\nDrive By Compromise\n\nCredentials from Password Stores\n\nExternal Remote Services\n\nValid Accounts\n\nValid Accounts: Local Accounts\n\nValid Accounts: Domain Accounts\n\nBrute Force I/O\n\nChange Operating Mode\n\nNetwork Connection Enumeration\n\nRemote System Information Discovery\n\nSystem Location Discovery\n\nData from Configuration Repository\n\nCommand-Line Interface\n\nRemote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol\n\nRemote Services: SSH\n\n\n-----\n\n###### KOSTOVITE\n\n\n**GENERATION**\n**FACILITY 1**\n\n\n**GENERATION**\n**FACILITY 2**\n\n\n**The KOSTOVITE intrusion highlights the risks of many single-point-of-failure**\n**perimeter defenses, particularly remote access devices exposed to the internet.

The overlaps with other activity\ngroups and consistent capability development could\nlead to more targeted ICS incidents beyond general\nsystem reconnaissance and collection. While Dragos\ncannot connect PETROVITE to any known, disruptive\nevent, the group remains active and continues to\ndisplay an interest in collection on ICS/OT systems\nand networks.\n\n**Dragos is aware of targeted operations**\n**that started during the third quarter of**\n**2019 and have intermittently continued throughout**\n**2021.

ERYTHRITE leveraged the popular\nWordPress plugin Formidable Forms to upload hundreds of\nmalicious PDFs loaded with thousands of keywords.

Of all the industrial sectors in 2021,\nransomware groups targeted the manufacturing industry more than any other, nearly twice as\nmuch as the other industrial groups combined.\n\n**THE UNINTENDED AND INTENDED RANSOMWARE THREATS TO OT**\nIn many industrial sector compromises, weak boundaries between OT and IT, and poorly\nunderstood interactions between these systems, coupled with the rise in remote access (as\nmore organizations rely on their work-from-home staff), have increased the overall risk. While\nransomware mainly targets enterprise IT systems, there are a number of instances when it does\nimpact OT directly and in integrated IT and OT environments.\n\nSome ransomware adversaries indirectly impact OT when attacking enterprise IT. Once\nadversaries achieve initial access, they can execute ransomware to gain a foothold in critical\nenterprise IT systems and potentially move laterally into OT systems. After compromising an\norganization, they demand ransoms that require victims to pay for the keys to decrypt their files.\nOften targets have little recourse to restore functionality to their systems.\n\nConversely, some ransomware groups specifically target OT systems. EKANS is a specific ICStargeted ransomware that in 2020 targeted companies across electric, oil and gas, medical and\npharmaceutical manufacturing, and automotive sectors. Dragos analyzed multiple variants\nof EKANS malware and discovered that the EKANS variant has the ability to stop ICS-related\nWindows processes before initiating encryption.\n\n\n**INDUSTRIAL SECURITY RANSOMWARE TRENDS** **Manufacturing**\nAnalyzing industrial security trends during 2021,\nDragos compiled data on these ransomware sectors:\nManufacturing accounted for 65%, with Food & Beverage\ncoming in second (11%), and Transportation third (8%).\n\n###### 90%\n\nWhen analyzing manufacturing subsectors, Dragos **LIMITED VISIBILITY**\nfound that Metal Components (17%), Automotive (8%), and\nTechnology (6%) were the most common. **POOR NETWORK PERIMETERS**\n\n**90%**\n\n**These are troubling trends when paired with the Dragos** **EXTERNAL CONNECTIVITY**\n**services team finding that the manufacturing sector is** **80%**\n**often the least mature in their OT security defenses.** **SHARED CREDENTIALS**\n\n**60%**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Ransomware by ICS Sector\n\n 211 9\nManufacturing Pharmaceuticals\n\n###### 35 4\nFood & Beverage Chemical\n\n###### 27 3\nTransportation Mining, Logistics\n\n###### 13 2\nEnergy Aerospace, Agriculture,\n\nICS Equipment Distributor\n\n###### 10\n 1\n\nOil & Gas\n\nConstruction, Water\n\n35\n\n27\n\n13\n10\n9\n1 [2 3 4]\n\n\n###### Ransomware by Manufacturing Subsector\n\n\nMetal Products\n\nAutomotive\n\nPlastics, Technology\n\nPackaging\n\nTextiles\n\nFood and Beverage\n\nMachinery\n\n\n**12**\n\n**11**\n\n\n211\n\n**17**\n\n\n**37**\n\n\n**9**\n\n\n**8**\n\n\n**6**\n\n\nAerospace, Medical, Steel, Building Materials\n\nLighting, Tools, Rubber, Paper\n\nEnergy, Adhesives, Children’s Toys\n\nBiotech, HVAC, Rail, Cables, Pet Food, Ceramics, Glass, Automation, Electronics\n\nDrilling, Water, Oil & Gas, Electric Motors, Electric, Telecom, Cabling, Recycling, Filtration,\nDental, Aviation, Security Equipment, Construction Components, Printing Machines, Jewelry,\nMaritime, Weapons, Chemical, ICS, Lubricants, floor Mats, Solvents, Military, Masonry,\nPaint, Furniture, Resins, Printing, Police Equipment, Vaccuums, Composites, Clay Pipe, Ice\nEquipment, Cutting Dies, Safety Products, Dairy\n\n\n**5**\n\n**4**\n\n**3**\n\n\n**2**\n\n\n**1**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Ransomware Incidents by Group/Strain\n\n\n**LOCKBIT 2.0** **CONTI**\n\n**GRIEF**\n\n**BLACKMATTER**\n\n\n**PYSA**\n\n**AVOS**\n\n**SNATCH**\n\n**EVEREST**\n\n**HIVE**\n\n**LV**\n\n\n**CLOP** **SYNACK**\n\n\n**SODINOKIBI**\n\n**SPOOK**\n\n**VICE SOCIETY**\n\n**RANSOMEXX**\n\n**CUBA**\n\n**MIDAS LEAKS**\n\n**COOMINGPROJECT**\n\n**AVADDON**\n\n\n= 1 RANSOMWARE ATTACK\n\n**PAYLOAD**\n\n\n**GROOVE**\n\n**KARMA**\n\n**SUNCRYPT**\n\n**ROOK**\n\n**ARCANE**\n\n**PROMETHEUS**\n\n\n**MOSES STAFF**\n\n**RAGNAR LOCKER**\n\n**QUANTUM**\n\n**54BB47H**\n\n**ALPHAV**\n\n**MARKETO**\n\n\n**ATOM SILO** **BLACKBYTE**\n\n**LORENZ**\n\n\n**RANSOMWARE INCIDENTS BY GROUP: CONTI AND LOCKBIT 2.0**\nTwo ransomware groups, Conti and Lockbit 2.0, caused 51 percent of the total\nransomware attacks, with 70 percent of their malicious activity targeting\nmanufacturing. Conti dates to 2020, with recent confirmed attacks targeting CS\nEnergy and Shutterfly. In June of 2021, Lockbit 2.0 retooled and now focuses on\nstealing data and extorting victims for financial gain by threatening publication\nof exfiltrated data if victims do not pay the ransom. In 2021, Lockbit 2.0 claimed to\npossess the data of energy equipment supplier Schneider Electric, according to a\npost on Lockbit 2.0’s dark web forum. The compromise was never confirmed, and\nthe posted Schneider Electric data appears to have come from a previous attack on\nVestas, a Danish wind turbine manufacturer.\n\n\n-----\n\n**WHY WERE RANSOMWARE GANGS SO SUCCESSFUL IN 2021?**\nThis spike in ransomware attacks can be attributed to the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)\nphenomena. However, another key factor is the digital transformation of the industrial sectors and\nthe increased connectivity between IT and OT. Ransomware gangs like Conti and Lockbit 2.0 have\nmobilized an underground marketplace where their developers outsource operations to affiliates\nwho execute the attacks. Affiliates do not require high-level technical expertise because the\nransomware software has been developed and they can purchase access to systems and hackers\nfor hire, which significantly lowers barriers to entry.\n\n**THE GROWING MATURITY OF RANSOMWARE AS A BUSINESS**\nWith ransomware actors having fewer barriers to entry the financial impacts are becoming higher\nfor the industrial sectors. Typically, ransomware groups threaten to release exfiltrated corporate\nand personal information before encrypting the target filesystems, then dump the information\non dark web leak sites. During the first half of 2021, the average remediation costs of ransomware\nattacks against ICS sectors continued to rise from downtime, staffing, disruption to device and\nnetwork operations, lost business opportunities, and paid ransoms.\n\nDarkSide (now rebranded as REvil) offered customer service with real-time chat support and\nbrought in at least $60 million before it announced it was closing its operations. Investing in\ntheir business, ransomware gangs are funding research and development, which is fueling their\nindustry as their extortion methods become more extreme.\n\nRansomware trends are likely to continue shifting as groups reform, reprioritize, and law\nenforcement pursues them and takes them offline. As groups disband and reform, there is a\nblending of ransomware strains, and a greater likelihood that more strains with ICS/OT capabilities\nwill be developed in 2022.\n\n**LOOKING AHEAD INTO 2022**\n\n**Dragos assesses with high confidence that ransomware will continue to disrupt**\n**industrial operations and OT environments, whether through the integration**\n**of OT kill processes into ransomware strains, the existence of flattened networks to prevent**\n**ransomware from spreading into OT environments, or through operators shutting down OT**\n**environments as a precaution while they attempt to stop IT ransomware from spreading to OT**\n**systems.**\n\n**Dragos assesses with low confidence that state-sponsored adversaries may leverage ransomware**\n**to mask their alternate operations, for theft of intellectual property (including key OT schematic**\n**details), for reconnaissance of target networks, and for other Stage 1 components of the ICS Cyber**\n**Kill Chain.**\n\n**Finally, Dragos assesses that ransomware actors’ extortion techniques will continue to grow**\n**in severity and intensity as adversaries deploy any means available to pursue their ransom**\n**payments.**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### SECTION TWO\n\n Dragos Frontline Perspective\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Lessons Learned from Incident Response\n\n A cybersecurity incident is a crisis for any organization. However, cyber attacks targeting industrial organizations, including ransomware, have the potential to disrupt operations and pose safety risks if not swiftly mitigated. Incident response is rarely an inexpensive endeavor in terms of money, people, operational disruption, or time.\n\n The Dragos Incident Response team helps organizations prepare for, respond to, and recover from cyber incidents in industrial environments. Our team of experienced incident responders have consulted on numerous cases where significant time and resources could have been saved with preparation. As an example, many of the questions that organizations want answered are best answered through network traffic analysis that cannot be obtained after the attack if the environment was not configured to collect that data or tools used to provide those insights had not been deployed prior to the incident. A key point is that while preparation ahead of an incident is always core in IT or OT incident response it is much more important in OT incident response because of the unique nature of the environments and questions to be answered.\n\n The following topics showcase some lessons learned from our field engagements in 2021 that may help organizations avoid some of the most common issues that increase the time, personnel, downtime, and expense of managing a cybersecurity incident.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Lessons Learned from the SolarWinds Compromise\n\nIn December 2020, the SolarWinds Orion breach\nwas reported. Initially, it was not clear how the\nSolarWinds breach affected ICS/OT environments. It\nis common knowledge that SolarWinds Orion is an\nIT infrastructure monitoring platform. It was not well\nunderstood, however, that several Managed Service\nProviders (MSPs) also use the tool to monitor their\ncustomer ICS/OT environments. Additionally, many\nindustrial OEMs embed the software as part of their\nmanagement offerings and some of the largest OEMs\nuse the tool to monitor service and maintenance\naccess. As a result, many ICS/OT environments were\ncompromised directly with the software installed in\ntheir environments or indirectly through their thirdparty agreements despite not directly installing\nSolarWinds in their own environment.\n\nBoth detection and documentation are crucial\nto incident response. The sooner an incident is\ndetected, the sooner you can stop an adversary\nfrom accomplishing their objectives–which often\nincludes severe financial damage to the target\norganization. Documenting an incident improves\nincident response workflows as well as the effective\nremediation and lessons learned afterward. If\norganizations do not properly document incidents\nand findings, they cannot learn from these events\nand will continue to make the same mistakes.\n\n**10** [Learn more here.](https://www.dragos.com/resource/collection-management-frameworks-beyond-asset-inventories-for-preparing-for-and-responding-to-cyber-threats/))\n\n\n**Beginning in January**\n**2021, the Dragos**\n**incident response**\n**team responded to**\n**several SolarWinds**\n**compromise cases.**\n**Aggregated across**\n**these cases the lessons**\n**learned were consistent**\n**for organizations to**\n**protect themselves**\n**from this style of**\n**supply chain risk:**\n\nMonitor and log\ninternal (East/West)\ncommunications\nwithin the industrial\nenvironments.\n\nMonitor and\nlog perimeter\n(North/South)\ncommunications\nalong all perimeters,\nincluding third party\nconnections.\n\nCustomize and test\nyour ICS/OT Incident\nResponse Plan, don’t\nrely on your IT Plan.\n\nKnow what data\nexists to support\nyour detection,\nanalysis, and hunting\ncapabilities.[10]\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Value of Root Cause Analysis\n\nIn 2021, Dragos responded to a few incidents that resulted from malfunctioning\nequipment or software, rather than adversaries. In each case, the impacted\norganization made the right call by activating their incident response plans and\nidentifying possible root causes that may have impacted plant processes. These\nengagements all proved the importance of analyzing the network traces caused\nby malicious activities with awareness of the OT protocols used and the industrial\nprocesses controlled by the systems investigated. The collaboration between internal\nsecurity and operations teams, external responders, and in some instances ICS\nvendors is key to a successful root cause analysis (RCA).\n\n###### Who Changed the Setpoints?\n\nIn one case, Dragos responded after an electric power transmission site observed\nan unauthorized setpoint change that resulted in a limited impact on operations\nand was quickly remediated. The command resembled a global test command run\nannually, but there was no test at the time. Because the edge devices used at the\nsite are radio-controlled, it was feared that the unauthorized command might have\nbeen sent via a Man-in-the-Middle attack. The organization did the right thing and\nlaunched an official investigation of the incident and retained Dragos to help with\nincident response and root cause analysis of the event.\n\nThe team of incident responders deployed the Dragos Platform to collect network\ntelemetry to monitor for potential, ongoing malicious activities. The incident\nresponse team identified identical commands issued to the edge devices. As the\nDragos Platform captured the traffic, responders were able to identify the host\nresponsible for issuing the commands and proceeded to collect forensic data and\nperform analysis. The team discovered that the command was issued by the actual\ncontrol software after the server rebooted. They contacted the OT vendor to help\ninvestigate the root cause and the vendor found a programming error caused by an\nedge-case configuration. Within two weeks from the point of contact, the vendor\nhad a fix for the software issue and deployed it to the customer environment\nshortly thereafter.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile this event was not a security breach, it highlights the value of network\nsecurity monitoring and root cause analysis beyond the cybersecurity use case.\nA complex issue was detected and the root cause was determined in a matter of\ndays. However, if the monitoring had been in place at the affected site prior to the\nincident, the resolution would have come more quickly.\n\nThis case also demonstrates the value of strong relationships with your most\nimportant OEMs and third-party vendors. The positive relationship between the\nclient, the OEM of the affected equipment, and Dragos enabled the joint team to\nquickly identify the root cause and identify and implement a solution.\n\n**NEED FOR MONITORING AND INCIDENT RESPONSE PLANS**\nHad this been an actual cyber attack, the setpoint changes could have had more\ndevastating effects. Because of a lack of monitoring network traffic, the point of\norigin from which the setpoints were changed would not have been identified and\nwould have to have been tediously hunted for using host forensic analysis. In most\ncases, the collection of forensic artifacts from hosts in ICS environments is a manual\nprocess that requires you to weigh the potential impact of this process against the\ndowntime of systems that control important physical processes.\n\nBecause the safety and reliability of ICS operations is the priority, forensic data\ncollection often takes place over an extended period of time. As a result, some\nimportant data may be overwritten, which is another reason why continuous\nnetwork monitoring is so important in ICS operations. Monitoring that is aware of\nthe industrial protocols that are used in a specific environment allows defenders to\nmake sense of interactions of the IT layer and with the physical layer of operations,\nsuch as the industrial process itself.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Ghost in the Power Generator\n\nIn another case, Dragos was called in for an incident that was also deemed to be\noperations related with no adversary involvement. One night, unexpectedly, the gaspowered turbines at a peak power generation site suddenly turned on and went into\nidle. The SCADA operations had not issued the command for the site to go online. The\ncompany appropriately activated its incident response retainer and Dragos personnel\nimmediately went to the site. Because no ICS network monitoring was in place at\nthe site, Dragos responders had to rely on logs and host data. Working with the local\noperations crew, our response team conducted a walkthrough inspection of the site.\n\nThe determination was made that the commands to activate the control loop to start the\ngenerator most likely came from the HMI housed in a small shed-like facility. There were\nno remote connections, so the team considered direct action. However, security cameras\ndid not show anyone approaching the HMI or the shed. The Dragos incident response\nteam did identify moisture on the HMI and noticed it was a touch screen that was also\nset to be abnormally bright.\n\nBecause of compliance and warranty concerns no non-native tools were allowed\nto be used on the HMI. Therefore, the Dragos incident response team improvised by\ndeploying MS Paint on the system as it is a native and signed binary. The team left\nthe system running overnight and in the morning was able to identify large brushlike movements on the HMI. The responders were able to use MS Paint to confirm\nthat the moisture was causing “clicks” on the touchscreen HMI that resulted in\nkicking off the control loop while the generator was down for maintenance.\n\nHad ICS network monitoring been in place at the site, malicious activity could have\nbeen ruled out as a root cause much faster by confirming or ruling out any remote\naccess to the HMI, potentially enabling the local operations team to identify the\nactual cause without having to call in external responders. Further, the commands\nfrom the HMI would have been immediately observed by the operations staff leading\nto less lost time and quicker root cause analysis on an operations issue.\n\nThis case also shows the importance of being on site during ICS incident response\nto accurately assess the environment and understand the situation. This awareness,\ncombined with experience and out-of-the-box thinking, can lead to the quick resolution\nof a case versus relying only on logs and forensic data.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Never Let an Incident Response Team’s First ICS Be Your ICS!\n\n\nAn electric operator contacted Dragos to conduct an incident\nanalysis after they experienced a ransomware attack on a control\ncenter for renewable energy. Dragos was the second team retained\nto respond to the case, after the first analysis left many questions\nunanswered.\n\nThe adversary leveraged an internet-connected SCADA server\nlisted on Shodan.io, harvested credentials on this system, and\nthen moved laterally through the environment. Because of\na weak security posture and no network segmentation, the\nadversary gained access to the domain controller and other key\nsystems at the plant. After manually exploring the environment\nand manipulating some systems to facilitate data infiltration\nand exfiltration, the adversaries went silent. A week later, the\nadversary executed the ransomware attack where they deployed\nscripts and tools to weaken the company’s defenses, such as\nMicrosoft Defender, and deployed ransomware through the Group\nPolicy, WinRM, and PSExec-as-a-service to most systems on\nthe network. The adversary also performed some anti-forensics\nmeasures by clearing the Windows event logs and disabling\nfurther logging. While they took their time initially exploring and\nmapping out the environment, the actual attack of manipulating\nits defenses to deploying and executing the malware happened in\nabout an hour.\n\nThe organization immediately realized something was wrong\nwhen applications failed and computer systems stopped\nresponding. They quickly called in an incident response\nprovider who did not have experience in ICS incident response.\nThe provider ran antivirus programs on the affected systems,\nwhich deleted data that would have facilitated root cause\nanalysis and did not result in recovering any data encrypted\nby the ransomware. They additionally spent time performing\nvulnerability scans across the environment which can be\nextremely risky in ICS/OT networks.\n\n\n**In this and similar**\n**engagements, the key**\n**takeaways are:**\n\nEnsure you have\nseparate Incident\nResponse Plans (IRPs) in place for\nIT and ICS/OT.\n\nSet up incident\nresponse retainers\nas part of your IRPs.\nEngaging outside help during an\nincident could cause you to select\ninadequate support when you\nneed it fast.\n\nWhen interacting\nwith an OT\nenvironment,\ncomprehensive knowledge of\nindustrial control systems is a\nmust. For example, pausing or\neven fully stopping or removing\ncomputer systems from an\nOT environment could impact\nthe safety and reliability of the\noperations.\n\nDo not run\nantivirus programs\non industrial\ncontrol systems to “remove” a\nmalware infection. The antivirus\nmalware deletion attempts\nresult in incomplete removal\nof the malware and files for\nessential OT operations could\nbe deleted. Systems must be in\na verifiable good state for safe,\nreliable operation of the ICS.\nCompromised computer systems\nin an ICS/OT environment should\nalways be rebuilt from known\ngood backups or golden images.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### AN MSP CASE STUDY\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, Dragos observed the MSP shut down three of its\nbroadband network connections affected by the Shadowpad malware, representing\nsome 762 static internet IP addresses directly allocated to the MSP. The MSP\nmoved services including the website and one of three previous firewalls to a\ndifferent network with only a few dynamic IP addresses. Dragos assesses with low\nconfidence that the network abandonment and migration by the MSP is related to\nthe MSP discovering or understanding the extent of compromise.\n\n###### Key Takeaways\n\nWhen performing incident response, following a proper process is important. Whether you are relying on\nan external incident response provider or have an internal team, always ensure they:\n\n**• Determine the root cause of the intrusion into the OT environment.**\n\n**• Develop a recommended course of action for the OT operations team to contain,**\n**mitigate, and eradicate.**\n\n**• During all steps, ensuring the OT environment remains in a safe and reliable state is**\n**imperative. Running antivirus software on OT computer systems with the intent to remove**\nmalware neither helps to effectively analyze a threat nor reliably removes it.\n\nAt best, this approach will remove malware partially from a system and will delete valuable\nforensic data while inspiring a false sense of security. The impacted network must be swept for\nadditional compromised systems and any affected system should be rebuilt from clean backups or\na golden image.\n\nAs an MSP, it is important to monitor all ingress and egress points on the network and monitor internal\nnetwork traffic for unusual lateral movement. By now it is an established fact that adversaries will target\nMSPs to leverage trusted access to the adversary’s advantage. Monitoring for any unusual activities\nis an important security measure to keep customers safe. Any access that can be switched to multifactor authentication (MFA) should be addressed. Considering the operational constraints of an MSP,\nMFA might be difficult to implement at best and impossible at worst. As it is one of the most effective\ndefensive controls, implementing MFA at least on all MSP-owned systems should be considered.\n\nAs an MSP customer, you should monitor all network segments and systems accessed by an MSP for\nany unusual activity such as administrative access outside of maintenance windows or access to systems\nthat are not managed by the MSP. Dragos realizes this is easier said than done. At minimum, perform risk\nassessment when considering tasking to an MSP and establish that OT security monitoring is an effective\nmethod to minimize risk that needs to be factored into the business case.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Complexity of Remote Access in OT Environments\n\n OT Watch is an optional subscription to the Dragos Platform that enables our global hunt team to find unknown threats from our customers ICS/OT environments, gain additional visibility and insights, and provide guidance on vulnerability management.\n\nWhen the attack on the Oldsmar water treatment facility went public, the Dragos OT Watch team\nbegan a series of threat hunts looking for other unauthorized access from legitimate remote access\nsolutions. Over the course of the threat hunt, the OT Watch team documented the following remote\naccess solutions to shed light on what remote access looks like in OT and how that can cause a\nbreach similar to Oldsmar and why remote access continues to be a security risk.\n\n**Over 90% of networks covered**\n**by OT Watch have SOME FACET OF**\n**REMOTE ACCESS in their industrial**\n**network segments.[12]**\n\n**Over 60% of environments**\n**have 4 OR MORE remote access**\n**mechanisms allowed into OT**\n\n**Over 30% of**\n**environments have some**\n\n**EXTERNAL ACCESS**\n**THAT IS CONTINUOUS**\n\n**Over 20% of environments**\n**have 7 OR MORE remote access**\n**mechanisms allowed into OT**\n\n**12** As a point of clarification, OT Watch itself is an external connection out of the environment. We did not\ninclude OT Watch traffic in this analysis as it does not enable remote access to the monitored networks.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### We have classified remote access into the following two categories:\n\n**OEM AND VENDOR** **FACILITY DEPLOYED**\n**REMOTE ACCESS SOLUTIONS:** **REMOTE ACCESS SOFTWARE**\nRemote access solutions are a key component Another class of remote access solutions are one-\nof modern OT equipment solutions, particularly off solutions such as Remote Desktop Protocol\nduring the pandemic when most organizations (RDP), TeamViewer, VNC (Virtual Network\nhad to quickly shift to a remote workforce.

You should pay particular attention to remote access methods that do not have**\n**specific use cases or are overly broad. Often, remote access to the OT environments is persistent and**\n**there is no baseline understanding for what is and is not “normal vendor access.”**\n\n\n-----\n\n**REMOTE ACCESS INTO OT ENVIRONMENTS**\nMany customers believe their OT networks are accessible only from their enterprise IT\nenvironments, or they are completely separated. The data tells a different story.\n\nThe following diagram shows a complicated architecture where multiple network segments have\nremote access to multiple network segments. Notably, the majority of remote access is not from the\n“Internet to OT” connection, but the connections between internal OT to OT systems. That said, a\nwide variety of sources and destinations exist between “IT to OT” and “OT to IT” connections.\n\n**The flows depicted in green are common and expected while the flows highlighted in**\n**pink are more interesting and need additional monitoring and auditing to ensure they**\n**are not being used improperly.**\n\nIT External\n\nIT\n\nRFC1918\n\nUnidentified\n\nDMZ\n\nOT\n\nOT\n\nDMZ\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Source to Destination Zone, by Traffic Volume\n\n**SSL**\n6.39%\n\n###### SSH Honeywell\n\n**Remote Access**\n\n###### 20.36% 5.58%\n\n GE ADH 9.84%\n\n**VNC**\n3.97%\n\n###### RDP PCAnywhere\n 7.50%\n\n**X11**\n2.35%\n**Telnet**\n\n### 41.44% TeamViewer\n\n<1%\n\n<1%\n**LogMeIn**\n\n**Bomgar**\n\n<1%\n\n**Open VPN** <1%\n<1%\n\n**GoToMyPC**\n<1% **IPSec**\n\n<1%\n\n**DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS FROM THE FIELD**\nThe physical consequences and impacts of a cyber attack on OT systems are\nexacerbated by the complex interdependencies between IT, OEM, and the cloud\nconnections that are deeply entwined within operations environments. The Dragos\nteam has been rank-stacking and comparing our findings year over year since 2017.\nOur key take-away: Dragos’s new customers in 2021 had the same issues that our\nnew customers had in 2020, who also had the same challenges as customers in the\nprevious years. In some ways, this is good because it enforces that we understand\nwhat the top challenges are for the industrial community.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TOP 4 KEY FINDINGS: ONE Limited or No OT Network Visibility\n\n CHANGE\n During 2021, Dragos uncovered that 86% of its services customers\n\n# -4\n\n###### had limited to no visibility into their ICS environment.\n\nVisibility is more than asset inventory. When customers only monitor\nthe IT to OT boundary without monitoring the activity inside the ICS\nnetwork, Dragos considers this limited visibility. Frequently, defenders\nare blind to critical network traffic when they do not capture the OT\ncommunication flows, or they capture these flows but do not utilize ICS\nprotocol dissection. Full visibility is achieved when network and device\nlogs are centralized and can correlate various segments with network\ntraffic analysis and asset inventories.\n\nDefenders can see the full picture of what is occurring across their\nindustrial assets and sites only with full visibility. Full visibility\nfacilitates the identification of threats. Threat detection can come in\nmany forms, but its major purpose is to emphasize behaviors that the\nhuman defender should be aware of such as ransomware, control\nmanipulation, and safety manipulation. Threat intelligence provides\nthe necessary context for threat detections so defenders can make\nthe best defensive decisions. Early detections, with the appropriate\ncontext, enable defenders to rapidly execute response playbooks, which\nexpedite response, containment, and remediation efforts.\n\n\n2021 86%\n2020 90%\n2019 81%\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TOP 4 KEY FINDINGS: TWO Poor Security Perimeters\n\n CHANGE\n In 2021, 77% of Dragos services engagements involved issues with\n\n# -11\n\n###### network segmentation (which is a slight decrease from 2020).\n\nFor the last two decades, OT asset owners have concentrated their\ncybersecurity posture on prevention. Specifically, they rely on\nsegmentation, firewalls, and DMZs to isolate their operational networks\nfrom the internet, corporate networks, and vendors. Yet, poor security\nperimeters continue to be a major problem for most OT asset owners.\n\nDragos considered findings to be related to poor security perimeters if\nthey involved issues such as porous firewall rules, network boundary\nbypasses, or flat networks. This includes instances where the only\nsegmentation is the initial firewall between the IT-OT boundary and\nwhen there are unnecessary communication pathways to critical\nassets within the network. While it is unlikely that an adversary could\ncause an operational impact with access only to the corporate network,\npoor perimeters between IT and OT often allow adversaries to pivot\nfrom the corporate network to operational networks, where they can\ncause ICS impacts. However, an OT interdependency on an IT asset,\nsuch as a billing system that also performs scheduling or product\ntracking, is one example of how an adversary could impact operations\nfrom the corporate network.\n\nEvery OT asset owner needs a defensible architecture. A network\nwith weak borders, especially when combined with a lack of visibility,\nis nearly impossible to defend from even a moderately motivated\nadversary.\n\n\n2021 77%\n2020 88%\n2019 71%\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TOP 4 KEY FINDINGS: THREE External Connections to the\n\n CHANGE\n ICS/OT Environment\n\n In 2021, external\n\n# +37\n\n###### connections to OT spiked upwards, more than doubling to 70%.\n\nA major theme in the 2019 Year In Review report was the disconnect\nbetween expectations and reality on fully segmented and air-gapped\nsystems. During 2020, there was a significant improvement in isolated\nICS environments (with a two-thirds drop in external routable network\nconnections). In 2021, external connections to OT spiked upwards, more\nthan doubling to 70%. Dragos assesses that this increase is due to the\nhigh demand for remote access in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMany OT environments appear fully segmented on paper, yet when\nvalidated with the Dragos Platform analysis the Dragos team finds\nthat the environments often have many connections and are not as\nsegmented as originally believed. These environments may have\nbeen initially designed and implemented as segmented, but over time\nfirewall exceptions and persistent vendor connections steadily bridged\nthe gap between IT and OT.\n\nThe most effective security control for reducing the cyber risks\nassociated with remote access is multi-factor authentication (MFA).\nHowever, MFA cannot be implemented everywhere or in every\nsituation. Dragos recommends that vendor connections are enabled\nupon request and then monitored to ensure they are used only when\nauthorized. And the ability to rapidly disconnect external connections\nis essential for effective incident response.\n\n\n2021 70%\n2020 33%\n2019 100%\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TOP 4 KEY FINDINGS: FOUR Lacked Separate IT & OT User\n\n CHANGE\n Management\n\n In 2021, 44% of Dragos\n\n# -10\n\n###### services engagements included findings related to shared credentials.\n\nFor example, an organization may leverage the same credential\nmanagement on the IT network as it does on the Demilitarized Zone\n(DMZ) and ICS network. This is yet another configuration that can lead\nto a weakening of perimeters and may enable an adversary to easily\ntraverse to ICS assets using the credentials it obtained from IT accounts.\n\nThere is no question that reusing credentials may feel more efficient to\nthe endpoint administrators maintaining your operating environments.\nHowever, frequently, this technique can allow an adversary to move\nlaterally across your operating environment. And, it may not raise\nany alarms if the activity is not recognized as “new” in your operating\nenvironment and lead to a security incident going unnoticed.\n\n\n2021 44%\n2020 54%\n2019 54%\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Findings Across Industry Verticals\n\nThe heatmap below illustrates a breakdown of our four key findings by OT industry\nverticals.\n\n###### 50%+ 70%+\n\n\n**USE OF SHARED CREDENTIALS BETWEEN IT**\n**AND OT VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING**\n**UPON THE VERTICAL.

The data from these engagements enables Dragos to provide key insights on\nthe OT industry as well as provide specific findings for individual sectors. Dragos uses\na consequence-driven approach called the Crown Jewel Analysis (CJA) Model when\nscoping and conducting these assessments. This approach helps bind the scope of\nassessments while keeping the adversary mindset.\n\n**THE CROWN JEWEL ANALYSIS (CJA) MODEL**\nThe Crown Jewel Analysis (CJA) Model is a repeatable scoping approach that helps\nvisualize how an attacker assesses a system to achieve a specific consequence.\n\nCJA is visualized using a reverse pyramid. For each layer, the elements contributing\nthe most to functional output (primary purpose); functional dependencies (reliance on\nother systems to fulfill functional output); and level of exposure must be analyzed and\nunderstood before progressing to a lower layer. Adversaries and activity groups utilize a\nsimilar process when identifying Crown Jewels to further their attack chain.\n\n###### SYSTEM OWNER Specific provider within an industry discipline, geographic region or demographic that may be targeted\n\n CRITICAL SYSTEM OR SUBSYSTEM Collection of assets, facilities, networks and/or operators that provide a specific, collective\n\nfunction and output (these determine your starting position within the organization)\n\n###### CRITICAL FUNCTION Required principal tasks of a system, such as heating, cooling, exchanging, pumping, OR SUB-FUNCTION separating, compressing, distributing, storing, etc.\n\n CRITICAL COMPONENTS Physical asset required to complete a system critical function (e.g. pumps, valves, motors,\n\npiping, suction screens, inlets, etc.\n\n###### CONTROLLERS Represented by their direct interconnection between the cyber or logical realm and the physical realm.

The scenarios illustrate realistic ways that an\nadversary could achieve a desired impact to the process or facility, specific to that\nfacility’s physical equipment implementation and security posture.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following heatmap shows the ICS impacts identified across each OT industry vertical.\nEach row represents a specific industry, and each column represents an operational\nimpact identified during the crown jewel analysis.\n\n##### 55% 20%\n\n\nof our crown jewel analyses (CJAs)\nhad a potential impact involving\nthe denial, loss, or manipulation of\nprocess control.\n\n\nincluded a loss of safety impact.

They include collaboration\nbetween all stakeholders, including IT and OT security\nteams and operations leaders to strengthen internal\ncommunication strategies and develop relationships.\nTTXs are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of\nthe client’s cybersecurity incident response plans, the\ncoordination of the plans with partners, capability and\nresource employment, communication flow, and the\nactions taken upon plan activation.\n\nA Dragos TTX demonstrates how a realistic attack may\noccur within a unique ICS environment based on the\norganization’s most concerning risks. Dragos passively\nresearches and analyzes perceived cybersecurity risks\nwithin the outward-facing network infrastructure. Any\nrisk that would allow the development of unauthorized\naccess to key OT assets is added to the exercise\nscenario. Unique environmental information such as\nasset types, vendors, personnel, partnerships, network\narchitecture, and models have been coupled with\nspecific threat behavior, real-world historical events,\nand activity groups to generate a theoretical exercise\nscenario.\n\nFindings and associated recommendations are listed\nin relation to the achievement of objectives through\nthe employment of core capabilities for ICS/OT\ncybersecurity readiness and IR, identified as: detect,\nactivate/elevate, respond, contain, communicate, and\nremediate/recover.\n\n\n**AVERAGE TTXs FINDINGS**\n\n\n**Metrics are as follows:**\n\nsquare Performed without Challenges **80-100**\n\nsquare Performed with Some Challenges **66-79**\n\nsquare Performed with Major Challenges **50-65**\n\nsquare Unable to Perform **0-50**\n\n**AVERAGE TTX SCORES**\nThe 2021 TTX overall score\nwas composed from many\ntabletop exercises encompassing\nseveral verticals with a strong\nrepresentation by both ONG and\nElectric verticals.

There were nearly double the published ICS and OT vulnerabilities in 2021 than 2020. This year highlighted vulnerabilities range from the remote, persistent, and nearly ubiquitous risks like Log4j, the Windows zero-day vulnerability PrintNightmare, and industrial hardware rootkit-level vulnerabilities that allow attackers to compromise exposed devices. These vulnerabilities underscore the fast-growing universe of persistent threats that exist across all layers of the Purdue Model. These vulnerabilities also highlight the complex nature of connected and networked components in OT environments and in ICS.\n\n There continues to be a trend where the guidance in vulnerabilities is lacking in context and details for operators to make risk-based decisions. Dragos added additional mitigation strategies for 69 percent of advisories that did not have sufficient mitigation advice in 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Apache Log4j Vulnerability\n\n**WHAT IS IT?**\nBefore the Alibaba Cloud Security team disclosed the Log4j vulnerability to Apache\nin November of 2021, few people anticipated that a Java logging library could have\nsuch negative far-reaching security impacts. The Log4j vulnerability (CVE-202144228) allows for remote code execution and access to servers and hardware that\nuse Java and that the Log4j framework can be exploited to take complete control of\na system.\n\nLog4j is a frequently used logging solution that allows developers to monitor the\nexecution of their Java applications for errors and exceptions. Utilizing Log4j\nwas considered a best practice and is a commonly used design pattern within\nenterprise Java development.\n\n**WHY ARE INDUSTRIAL NETWORKS VULNERABLE TO LOG4J?**\nThe exploitation of Log4j involves sending a specially designed request to the\ntarget system. The request generates a log using Log4j and leverages the Java\nNaming and Directory Interface (JNDI) lookup feature to perform a request to an\nattacker-controlled server from where a malicious payload can be fetched and\nexecuted. Industrial networks are among the systems that are vulnerable to the\nLog4j Java logging library.\n\nDragos has observed both the attempted and successful exploitation of the Log4j\nvulnerability in the wild. Based on these observations, on December 8, 2021, Dragos\ncoordinated a takedown of malicious domains used during the early exploitation\nattempts. Dragos has also observed other intelligence organizations reporting\ncyber criminals launching Log4j attacks to deliver Cobalt Strike beacons, malware,\ncryptocurrency miners, ransomware, DDoS attacks, and other malicious programs.\n\nBecause Log4j has been a ubiquitous logging solution for Enterprise Java\ndevelopment for decades, the vulnerability has the potential to persist within the\nsoftware and hardware of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) environments for years\nto come. Log4j is found in open-source repositories used in numerous industrial\napplications, such as Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control (OPC)\nFoundation’s Unified Architecture (UA) Java Legacy. Adversaries also can leverage\nLog4j in proprietary Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Energy\nManagement Systems (EMS), which use Java in their codebase.\n\n\n-----\n\n**NEXT STEPS TO MITIGATE LOG4J**\nMajor OT vendors have been disclosing the vulnerability’s impact on their software\nand equipment. Dragos assesses additional disclosures will continue as more\nvendors identify the use of Log4j across ICS product lines. Unfortunately, the nature\nof the Log4j vulnerability makes it challenging to identify. Because of this, Dragos\nassesses that Log4j will be a persistent vulnerability in ICS environments for years\nto come.\n\nOT networks that incorporate robust segmentation in their environments reduce\nthe risks from this vulnerability, but should be patched during the next turnaround\nor operational shutdown. For ICS environments that lack segmentation or allow\ndirect internet access to ICS assets such as JAVA-based SCADA / HMI products /\nhardware devices, Dragos recommends that organizations patch immediately and\nstrongly consider disabling internet access to all affected ICS/OT assets.\n\n###### Windows Zero-Day\n PrintNightmare\n\n**WHAT IS IT?**\nOn June 29, 2021, security researchers at Sangfor Technologies accidentally\ndisclosed a Windows zero-day vulnerability nicknamed PrintNightmare in a\nhow-to-exploit guide published on a public GitHub repository. PrintNightmare is a\ncritical security vulnerability affecting the Microsoft Windows operating system.\nThe vulnerability occurs within the print spooler service and allows a remoteauthenticated adversary to execute malicious code at SYSTEM-level privileges.\nThis enables an adversary to create new users with full user rights, install\nmalicious software, and modify or delete data.\n\n**HOW ADVERSARIES GAIN ACCESS TO OT NETWORKS WITH PRINTNIGHTMARE**\nAdversaries can leverage PrintNightmare CVE-2021-34527, CVE-2021-34481, and\nCVE-2021-36958 vulnerabilities to gain access to OT networks from IT networks\nthrough OT DMZ remote access workstations or “jump boxes” if they are left\nunpatched. Also, these vulnerabilities make an OT network’s unpatched Windows\nassets susceptible to lateral movement and privilege escalation.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PrintNightmare vulnerability was first discovered in March 2021. Sangfor, a\nnetwork security and cloud computing solutions company, planned to share its\nresearch at Black Hat that year. However, the proof-of-concept (POC) was released due\nto confusion over another Print Spooler vulnerability (CVE-2021-1675, released on June\n8, 2021). The researchers assumed the remote code execution (RCE) proof-of-concept\nwas the same method to exploit Windows Print Spooler CVE-2021-1675 and thus was\nthe same vulnerability. Because CVE-2021-1675 had already been patched, they saw no\nharm in releasing details earlier than planned.\n\nThe exploitation of the PrintNightmare vulnerability can enable the compromise of a\ndesktop or server running the Print Spooler service and allows an adversary to obtain\nSYSTEM-level privileges. On July 6, 2021, Microsoft began releasing unscheduled or\nout-of-band patches to address the vulnerability, which resulted in some printers no\nlonger functioning – where after patching, only administrators could install printer\ndrivers to a Windows print server.\n\nA third vulnerability was discovered on July 15, 2021, impacting the Windows Print\nSpooler Service (CVE-2021-34481) that could also allow an adversary to perform remote\ncode execution at SYSTEM-level privileges. Microsoft addressed this third vulnerability\non August 10, 2021, with an out-of-band patch. A fourth vulnerability (CVE-2021-36958)\nwas then discovered on August 11, 2021, affecting the Windows Print Spooler Service\nagain with remote code execution (RCE) at SYSTEM-level privileges if exploited. This\nfourth vulnerability was patched on September 14, 2021, during the September 2021\nMicrosoft Patch Tuesday security updates.\n\n**WHAT IS THE RISK OF PRINTNIGHTMARE TO OT ENVIRONMENTS?**\nDragos has not observed any adversaries leveraging the PrintNightmare\nvulnerability in OT network compromises. However, Dragos penetration\ntesters have successfully leveraged PrintNightmare to help clients enhance\ntheir detections for it. For example, detections and preventions were in place\nfor blocking the binary and PowerShell script variants of the exploit in some\nenvironments. Dragos demonstrated capabilities by executing the PowerShell\nvariant of PrintNightmare in memory and by leveraging PowerShell ISE to bypass\nthe prevention and detection mechanisms.\n\nThe vulnerabilities in the Print Spooler Service enable escalation of privileges\nand freedom of movement within the OT network’s Windows assets. Windows\nassets in an OT environment can serve many functions such as engineering\nand remote access workstations, HMIs, historians, and multiple types of servers\nproviding basic networking and domain functions. Leaving these assets unpatched\nallows even low-sophistication adversaries to have more options and methods for\ncompromising network assets.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PLC and Industrial Hardware Rootkit-Level Vulnerabilities\n\n**THE LONG-TERM RISKS OF PERSISTENT ROOTKITS**\nExisting vulnerabilities in industrial equipment often allow threat groups to install\npersistent rootkits when there are insufficient hardware protections in the equipment’s\noriginal design. Most modern industrial hardware lacks the functionality needed\nto securely boot the device, and often both modern and legacy hardware remain in\nservice for decades. This results in a class of vulnerabilities that do not disappear as\nlong as the hardware remains in service.\n\nRootkit-style vulnerabilities in the industrial space are not new. Specific research\nexamples go back more than a decade to 2009.[13] Due to a rush to fix long-standing\ninsecurities in industrial products combined with existing industrial protocols, this\nclass or chain of vulnerabilities is becoming increasingly difficult to detect. Frequently\nvendors add encryption features to the industrial protocols, while leaving the\nunderlying insecurity exposed. On the surface this strategy looks good to end users\nbecause traffic is no longer in plain text, but this does not add much, if any, complexity\nto the path to compromise that the adversary must follow or the defenses he must\nsurmount or circumvent.\n\nAs a result, it is more challenging to analyze traffic on the wire to determine if a device\nis being compromised. For example, an attacker may need to circumvent a trusted\nrelationship between the engineering workstation and the PLC. Once that trusted\nrelationship is exploited, the controller may be permanently infected. Worse, if the\ntraffic is encrypted, it may be tough to determine that the infection took place.\n\nThere are many examples of firmware rootkits in the wild and many devices have a\nseries of vulnerabilities that can be used together to install rootkits.\n\n**13** [Leveraging Ethernet Vulnerabilities in Field Devices – Digital Bond](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228849043_Leveraging_ethernet_card_vulnerabilities_in_field_devices)\n\n\n-----\n\n**WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS OF ROOTKIT VULNERABILITIES?**\nIn 2021, Iranian researchers reported[14] a rootkit they discovered in a server’s integrated\nLights Out peripheral (iLO) boards. The rootkit allowed the adversary to maintain\naccess to the individual board on the server hardware. From this point, the adversary\nissued low-level commands to the computer hardware, including the ability to wipe\nthe server remotely and potentially install new software along with or in place of the\nstandard computer operating system.\n\nIn 2021, Siemens disclosed a vulnerability in its PLC, CVE-2020-15782,[15] which can\nallow an attacker to load malicious logic files into the PLC. This malicious logic can\ncircumvent memory protections in the PLC and may overwrite core PLC functions\nwith a rootkit. Dragos discovered similar problems with other PLC logic runtimes in\nprior years. In 2019, Dragos demonstrated use of a ladder logic payload for developing\na rootkit in Phoenix Contact’s logic runtime, which is used by dozens of PLC vendors.[16]\nEarlier research covered rootkits in another ladder logic runtime by 3S-Software.[17]\n\nTriconex SIS was the victim of such an attack, which used CVE-2018-8872 and CVE2018-7522[18] to install additional functionality in the firmware. Dragos continued to\nresearch the device and identified several other rootkit-style vulnerabilities[19] in the\nTriconex line, particularly in the network interface cards of the controller which could\nbe used for a similar purpose as the HP iLO rootkit.\n\nDragos has researched a number of industrial embedded products including\nEmerson’s WirelessHART Gateway products,[20] Tofino Xenon industrial hardware,[21]\nLilee Systems train communications gateways[22] and GE MDS radio equipment.[23]\nVendors have been responsive to the issues reported. However, the designs of these\nproducts mean that they can rarely be secured from the risk of rootkit installation.\nInstead, Dragos advisories highlight which services allow for the potential\ninstallation of a rootkit so that end users may restrict access to and monitor those\nservices for suspicious activity.\n\n**[14 Implant.ARM.iLOBleed.a – AmnPardaz; 15 SSA-434534 – Siemens Product CERT; 16 Broken Rungs – CS3STHLM;](https://threats.amnpardaz.com/en/2021/12/28/implant-arm-ilobleed-a/)**\n\n**[17 Vulnerability Inheritance in Dutch Controllers – Black Hat Sessions; 18 ICSA-18-107-02 – ICS CERT; 19 VA-2018-02 – Dragos Triconex Vulnerability Report;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-qrKtDhyeg)**\n\n**[20 VA-2021-06 – Dragos Emerson WirelessHART Gateway Vulnerability Report; 21 VA-2021-02 – Tofino Xenon Security Appliance Vulnerability Report;](https://portal.dragos.com/#/products/VA-2021-06)**\n\n**[22 VA-2022-01 – Lilee Systems/Alstom Rail CMU-2110 Vulnerabilities; 23 VA-2022-03 – GE MDS Network and Serial Vulnerabilities](https://portal.dragos.com/#/products/VA-2022-01)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**MITIGATING THE RISKS OF ROOTKIT VULNERABILITIES**\nDeveloping a full-fledged rootkit is not a simple task. Finding and chaining\nthe vulnerabilities together to allow firmware modification requires significant\nresearch. Once installed, a rootkit may allow for intentional or unintentional\ndamage to the equipment. For example, a rootkit that does not properly sanitize or\nbounds-check future attacker inputs can cause misoperation.\n\nDragos assesses that this was the case with the TRISIS rootkit, where after\ninstallation the rootkit allowed for direct memory tampering. Dragos assesses\nthat an error in the memory tampering caused the safety system to trip the plant,\ncausing the discovery of the implant. This example highlights the need for the\nattacker to test their rootkit on numerous revisions of the target system under\nvarious configurations. Rootkits should not be considered the most likely problem.\nHowever, vulnerabilities that present persistent access to embedded systems can\nbecome a problem. The compromise of these devices can be challenging to detect\nand root out of a network.\n\nThe best steps to mitigate the risks associated with rootkits include:\n\n - Ask the vendor to implement the NULL CIPHER when adding security to\ntheir protocols. This allows devices and users to mutually authenticate while\nleaving the network traffic visible to inspection.\n\n - Monitor embedded devices for unusual network traffic. For example, a VPN\nappliance or PLC establishing or attempting to establish outbound network\nconnections is a cause for concern.\n\n - Check all downloads with the vendor code signature to ensure it is legitimate\nand unmodified software.\n\n - Minimize network exposure of embedded products and monitor the network\ntraffic to and from such products. Remember that embedded devices are\ncomplicated to analyze forensically because network traffic flows are often the\nonly practical way to analyze these devices without sending them back to the\nfactory.\n\nKeeping these longstanding issues in mind when mitigating new device vulnerabilities is essential. It is crucial to be aware of rootkit vulnerabilities when exposing\ndevices. Even if a device “has all the patches applied,” it could still be susceptible to\nvulnerability chaining or even abuse of features which could allow an attacker to\ninstall a rootkit and compromise your system.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### BY THE NUMBERS\n\n## Key ICS Vulnerability Trends\n\n###### In 2021, the number of reported ICS vulnerabilities\n\n continued to increase, which coincided with an\n\n increase in vendors providing patches for disclosed\n\n flaws in advisories. Dragos researchers analyzed\n\n 1703 ICS/OT common vulnerabilities and exposures\n\n (CVE) during 2021, which is more than twice as last\n\n year. For each CVE, Dragos independently assesses,\n\n confirms, and often corrects the advisories and\n\n describes any flaws in firmware or software.\n\n Of the advisories that Dragos individually reviewed\n\n in 2021, 38 percent contained errors in the Common\n\n Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score associated\n\n with the CVE. Asset owners should take this into\n\n account when making patching and mitigation\n\n decisions for their networks.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Where Do the Vulnerabilities Reside?\n\n\n**Of the vulnerabilities that**\n**Dragos focused on in 2021,**\n**77 percent resided deep**\n**within the ICS network,**\n**meaning they apply to**\n**equipment on Levels 0 to**\n**3 of the Purdue Model.**\n**This includes engineering**\n**workstations, PLCs, sensors,**\n**and industrial controllers.**\n\n###### 56%\n\n**of the vulnerabilities**\n**Dragos analyzed were at**\n**Purdue level 3 and 2.**\n\n###### 21%\n\n**reside deep within the ICS**\n**network, at levels 0 or 1.**\n\n\n**PHYSICAL PROCESS: FIELD I/O DEVICES**\nLEVEL O\n\n\n**INTERNET DMZ**\nLEVEL 5\n\n\n**ENTERPRISE ZONE**\nLEVEL 4\n\n\n**PLANT DMZ**\nLEVEL 3.5\n\n\n**CONTROL CENTER/PROCESSING LAN**\nLEVEL 3\n\n\n###### 23%\n\n**of the advisories Dragos**\n**analyzed applied to**\n**products within the**\n**enterprise bordering the**\n**internet at Purdue Level**\n**3.5, 4, or 5.**\n\nOften this includes networking\ncommunication equipment,\nVPNs, data historians, remote\ndesktop software, or firewalls\ncommonly deployed in the\ndemilitarized zone or enterprise\nnetworks.\n\n\n**LOCAL HMI LAN**\nLEVEL 2\n\n\n**CONTROLLER LAN**\nLEVEL 1\n\n\nAt the lower levels, adversaries would need access to a control\nsystem network to exploit these vulnerabilities, making them more\ndifficult to exploit. Implementing proper network segmentation can\nhelp mitigate these vulnerabilities, especially when combined with\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) for remote sessions.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Loss of View, Loss of Control, or Both\n\nLoss of control and loss of view are among the worst operations scenarios in an ICS environment.\nIn these conditions data continues to flow and the systems continue to operate, but they are no\nlonger operating as designed and the operator is typically unaware of the issue. In 2021, 35 percent\nof the advisories that Dragos analyzed could cause both a loss of view and loss of control in an OT\nsystem. The percentage is much smaller when looking at loss of one or the other, as shown below.\n\n\n###### Loss of Control only (by Advisory) 0.4%\n\n\n###### Loss of View only (by Advisory) 1.2%\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Many Advisories Lack Actionable Guidance \n\n\n###### 19% of those advisories without a patch had no alternate mitigation\n\n 64% of those advisories with a patch still didn’t provide alternate mitigation\n\n\nIn 2021, 24 percent of advisories had no patch\nwhen announced, while 76 percent had a\npatch. Frequently, vendors do not provide\nadvice to asset owners and operators if they\nare unable to patch the identified vulnerability.\nOf the advisories that Dragos tracked in 2021\nthat did not initially have a patch, 19 percent\nhad no mitigation. Sixty-four percent of those\nadvisories that had a patch had no mitigation.\n\nWhen a patch is unavailable from a vendor or\nindustrial organizations find that patching isn’t\nfeasible or is too expensive from an operational\nstandpoint, they look for alternative mitigation\nas a substitute. In 2021, Dragos found that 96\n**percent of the patches that they analyzed had**\n**no alternate mitigation.**\n\n# 69%\n\n\n###### Advisories with no patch when announced 24%\n\n 2021\n\n 76% had a patch\n\n|ed %|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n\n**Dragos provides customers with insight**\n**into managing risks on disclosed ICS**\n**vulnerabilities beyond what is included**\n**in vendor advisories. In 2021, we provided**\n**additional mitigation advice for 69 percent**\n**of advisories that did not include this**\n**information.**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Correcting Vulnerability Severity Ratings\n\n\nIn addition to the lack of actionable information\nfor most ICS-related vulnerability advisories, many\nadvisories and individual vulnerabilities contained\nerrors that could inadvertently mislead practitioners\nwho use CVSS scores to triage for mitigation or\npatching. These errors could cause asset owners and\noperators to dedicate more resources to fixing the\nvulnerabilities that represent a lower level of risk and\nseverity over those that might represent a higher level\nof risk for their own ICS environments.\n\nCVEs are scored using the InformaCVSS, which is a free\nand open industry standard for assessing the severity of\ncomputer system security vulnerabilities. The National\nInfrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC) launched the\nCVSS scoring system in February 2005, with the goal\nof providing “open and universally standard severity\nratings of software vulnerabilities.” CVSS scores are\ncalculated for each CVE based on a formula that depends\non several metrics that approximate ease-of-exploit and\nthe impact of exploit. Scores range from 0 to 10, with\n10 being the most severe. CVSS was designed with IT\nsystems in mind, but it can be somewhat helpful in ICS/\nOT environments as well.\n\nDragos provides corrected CVSS scores based on how\nan adversary could leverage a vulnerability in ICS\nenvironments in its WorldView threat intelligence\nreports. The corrected information allows practitioners\nto prioritize the CVEs that carry the most risk for their\nown environments and to focus their resources on the\nmost severe issues first. However, CVSS scores can\nbe misleading and often do not accurately capture all\nof the risk of a particular vulnerability. ICS security\nprofessionals should not use them as the sole factor in\nprioritizing vulnerabilities.\n\nIn 2021, Dragos gave a higher score to 52% of CVEs relating\nto ICS/OT networks than what these CVEs had received at\npublication. Forty-five percent of the severities that Dragos\nanalyzed had a lower severity score than at publication,\nand three percent stayed the same.\n\n\n###### CVE SCORES THAT DRAGOS CORRECTED\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Vulnerability Recommended Actions: Remediate, Mitigate, Monitor, Ignore.\n\nDragos works with the community to help vendors provide more\naccurate, actionable, and easier-to-track advisories. In 2021, we\nsignificantly enhanced the vulnerability management features offered\nto customers through the Dragos Platform.\n\nDragos assesses vulnerabilities in our WorldView Intelligence reports\nand in the Dragos Platform and categorizes them by threat levels:\n“Immediate Action,” “Limited Threat,” “Possible Threat,” “No Action,\nand “Hype.” Dragos also recommends four different responses to\nthose threats. Immediate action vulnerabilities require just that,\nconsideration within the environment and a priority for remediation.\nThese are network exploitable vulnerabilities that may have been\nactively exploited in the wild or for which a public exploit is available\nonline. These flaws have a higher risk of impacting ICS networks and\ngenerally apply to devices that can affect the industrial control process.\nIn 2021, four percent of vulnerabilities were in the “Remediate” category.\n\nAbout half of the vulnerabilities fall into the “Limited Threat” category.\nDragos recommends defenders resolve these vulnerabilities through\nproper network hygiene, segmentation, and network monitoring. A\ncommon recommendation is to limit the potential communication\npaths so that assets that need to communicate with each other are\nthe only assets that can communicate with each other over routable\nprotocols. This enables ICS security professionals to funnel ICS/OT risks\ninto focal points that they can monitor for threats so they can get their\nteams back to intelligence-based decision making.\n\n\n###### 2021\n\n\n**REMEDIATE**\n\n\n###### 4.2%\n\n 53%\n\n 34%\n\n 8.8%\n\n\n**MITIGATE**\n\n\n**MONITOR**\n\n\n**IGNORE**\n\n\nIn the past year, Dragos found that the Dragos Platform could provide additional recommended\nactions on top of the Now, Next, Never categories used in previous years. The focus is to highlight\nthe specific actions customers should take based on the risk level of the assessed vulnerabilities.\nSo, instead of discussing “Now, Next, Never” prioritization, Dragos now provides the recommended\nactions: Remediate, Mitigate, Monitor, and Ignore.\n\nPossible risks are often local threats which can coincide with adversaries living off the land. Dragos\nrecommends that ICS security professionals monitor these vulnerabilities for malicious activity. In 2021,\n87 percent of the vulnerabilities that Dragos analyzed were in the “Mitigate” and “Monitor” categories.\n\nVulnerabilities in the “Ignore” category do not increase the level of risk to the process at all. The effort\nit takes to mitigate these vulnerabilities is generally not a good use of the ICS security professional’s\ntime because adversaries are not as likely to exploit them. Only 9% of the vulnerabilities that Dragos\nreviewed were in this category.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Mitigating Vulnerabilities in 2022\n\nWith security concerns growing and controls mandated in some industries, the benefits from the\nlevel of effort spent on one security control over another are not always clear. In the realm of ICS/\nOT vulnerabilities, it is important to focus and prioritize threats accurately and have clear actionable\nmitigations that reduce the amount of downtime, while still protecting people and processes.\n\n**PUBLISHED VENDOR AND PUBLIC CERT ADVISORIES ALONE OFTEN DO NOT**\n**PROVIDE ENOUGH DETAILS TO MITIGATE THE INHERENT RISKS AND BRIDGE**\n**THE GAPS UNTIL IT IS TIME TO APPLY A PATCH.**\n\nWhile it is a positive action when a firmware or software patch is released with an\nadvisory, end users in industrial environments may still hesitate to apply the patch.\n\n**PATCHES ARE OFTEN SYNONYMOUS WITH DOWNTIME AND THERE ARE**\n**MANY DOCUMENTED CASES WHERE THE ACT OF PATCHING HAS CAUSED**\n**ISSUES OR PLANT FAILURES.**\n\nIn a best-case scenario, applying a patch requires restarting software. This can be\nchallenging for a plant that operates 24/7. Even if a plant or manufacturing facility\nruns a regular business workday, patching at any time introduces the risk of failure.\nIf applying a patch fails, the system may need to be re-installed or even restored from\na backup. This takes time and production may come to a halt.\n\n**OTHER ALTERNATE, LESS DISRUPTIVE MITIGATIONS CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS**\n**RESTRICTING THE PORT NUMBERS FOR NETWORK-EXPOSED VULNERABLE**\n**SERVICES.**\n\nA firewall can be used to restrict access to the affected service, reducing risk until a\npatch can be applied. Other mitigations include implementing configuration changes\nthat disable a vulnerable feature, file extensions that make it possible to monitor\ninbound email attachments, web proxy servers and file change permissions without\naffecting the program functionality, or network monitoring for exploitation of the\nvulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 5 Security Controls for a World- Class OT Cybersecurity Program\n\nFive years ago, the Dragos YIR was designed to drive insights into where the ICS/OT community\ndefenses are and to better describe the threats and vulnerabilities that are unique to industrial\nenvironments.\n\nThis multi-year data set and the findings from this year’s report point to clear security controls that\ncan put organizations on a path to a more safe and reliable industrial process. Dragos recommends\nthat organizations focus on key security controls that can be done well, as opposed to spreading the\nfocus across too many possibilities. There are many IT security controls that have a significantly\nreduced value when applied to OT or can introduce risk to the OT environment. Taking this into\nconsideration, here are the five security controls that when implemented have the best value in\nsignificantly enhancing ICS/OT networks against cyber threats.\n\n**A DEFENSIBLE ARCHITECTURE**\nNetwork architects can leverage traditional tools and concepts such as strong\nsegmentation, firewalls, or software defined networks to reduce cyber risk. This can\ntake a variety of forms such as IEC62443 zones and conduits, DMZs, jumphosts, etc.\n\nA key component of a defensible architecture is the ability to add humans to make\nit a defended architecture. As an example, unmanaged switches and flat networks\nare an indefensible architecture in most cases due to the inability for defenders to\nget the data they need to act. Infrastructure preparation and data gathering is a core\nrequirement to being able to defend a network.\n\n**ICS NETWORK MONITORING**\nVisibility gained from monitoring your industrial assets validates the security\ncontrols implemented in a defensible architecture. Threat detection from monitoring\nallows for scaling and automation for large and complex networks. Additionally,\nmonitoring can also identify vulnerabilities easily for action.\n\nTo gain the values of ICS network monitoring ensure that the organization can\nmonitor East/West traffic inside the ICS network and do so with an understanding\nof the ICS protocols and what is happening within them. The unique system-ofsystems nature of ICS means there’s a higher emphasis on network monitoring than\non endpoint monitoring though both should be done when possible.\n\n\n-----\n\n**REMOTE ACCESS AUTHENTICATION**\nThe most effective control for remote access authentication is multi-factor\nauthentication (MFA). Where MFA is not possible, consider alternate controls such as\njumphosts with focused monitoring. The focus should be placed on connections in\nand out of the OT network and not on connections inside the network.\n\n**KEY VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT**\nThe majority of vulnerabilities do not need to be addressed if you have a defensible\narchitecture. Dragos recommends defenders prioritize those that bridge IT and\nOT over those residing deep within the OT network or those that fall into the\n“Remediate” category in Dragos’s vulnerability analysis. In short, roughly 4% of\nvulnerabilities this year met this qualification.\n\n**ICS INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN (IRP)**\nLastly, Dragos recommends that industrial organizations have a dedicated incident\nresponse plan (IRP) for their ICS/OT environments, and that these organizations regularly exercise the plan with cross-disciplinary teams (IT, OT, Executives, etc.).\n\nOne very effective way of utilizing an incident response retainer with a provider like\nDragos, or others, is to have a Tabletop Exercise against a real threat scenario the\norganization is concerned about and use that to drive alignment across the organization. The scenario and TTX should also be used to identify use-cases and key tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures security operations personnel should be monitoring for\ninstead of expecting them to identify and analyze every anomaly that occurs.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Dragos is an industrial (OT/ICS/IIoT) cybersecurity company on a mission to safeguard civilization.\n Dragos is privately held and headquartered in the Washington, D.C. area with regional presence around the world, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and the Middle East.\n\n Dragos.com\n\nCopyright © 2022 Dragos, Inc.
