Unfortunately, the number\nof [ATPs is growing over the years, the majority of them goes under the radar for a long](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/26592/cyber-crime/pitty-tiger-atp.html)\nperiod.\n\nIn 2013, Adrian Nish of BAE Systems investigated on a cyber attack suffered by an\nengineering company in the UK that operates in the national power industry. The security\nexperts discovered that hackers have compromised the company network for some time,\nexfiltrating any kind of information.\n\n_“The group has probably been working for about two years now,” Nish explained. “It’s_\n_an emerging trend in the Middle East. That’s a complicated region and the offensive_\n_side of things is becoming complicated there too. There’s offensive cyber companies_\n_and local malware authoring now.”_\n\nNish identified the C&C servers used by the threat actors and discovered that Google was\nindexing some of the machines used by the hackers to siphon data. According to the\nresearcher, the bad actors could be members of a pro-Iranian group and proved to have\naccess to a wide set of hacking tools.\n\nBAE firm dubbed the APT group Ali Baba because a code name in one of the tools\nbelonging to their arsenal.\n\n_“They had taken network diagrams, usernames and credentials from an Israeli_\n_university and even an entire Web app that they stole from a group in the Middle East,”_\n_[Nish said in a talk at the Kaspersky Lab Security Analyst Summit here Monday. “They](http://sas.kaspersky.com/)_\n_had even stolen some signatures, physical signatures from people who had scanned_\n_them for some reason. What could possibly go wrong with that?”_\n\n\n-----\n\nNish confirmed to have discovered nearly 40 distinct hacking tools, including five modules of\ncustom malware, a key logger, a custom hash cracker and many others. The expert\nhighlighted some interesting methods for defeating incident response on compromised\nnetworks and for data exfiltration.\n\nNish detailed one of the tools in the arsenal of the Ali Baba APT, Fakeddos.exe, that was\nused the hackers to generate large amounts of junk traffic on compromised networks, a tactic\nused by the threat actor to overwrite the logs of legitimate traffic making difficult investigation\nfrom security firms.\n\n_“That really makes incident response quite a pain, really,” Nish said._\n\n[Ali Baba hackers used a singular exfiltration technique based on email, they disguised the](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30624/cyber-crime/hackers-used-data-exfiltration-based-video-steganography.html)\noutbound emails as Viagra spam messages to avoid detection of defense systems.\n\nAccording to a [report published by the security company Cylance, the UK firm wasn’t the](http://www.cylance.com/assets/Cleaver/Cylance_Operation_Cleaver_Report.pdf)\nunique known victim of the Ali Baba, the APT also had compromised transportation\n[companies in South Korea and Pakistan. Cylance identified the hacking team as OpCleaver.](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30734/intelligence/operation-cleaver-iranian-hackers.html)\n\n**[Pierluigi Paganini](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559)**\n\n**[(Security Affairs – Ali Baba APT, cyber espionage)](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)**\n\n[Ali BabaAli Baba APTAPTcyber espionageCybercrimeexfiltrationMiddle EastOpCleaver](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ali-baba)\n\nShare On\n\n\n-----\n\nYou might also like\n\n**[China-linked RedAlpha behind multi-year credential theft campaign](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/134519/apt/redalpha-china-credential-theft-campaign.html)**\n\nAugust 17, 2022\nBy [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Bugdrop dropper includes features to circumvent Google’s security Controls](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/134508/malware/bugdrop-android-malware.html)**\n\nAugust 17, 2022\nBy [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\nCopyright 2021 Security Affairs by Pierluigi Paganini All Right Reserved.\nBack to top\n\n[Home](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)\n[Cyber Crime](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-crime)\n[Cyber warfare](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-warfare-2)\n[APT](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/apt)\n[Data Breach](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/data-breach)\n[Deep Web](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/deep-web)\n[Digital ID](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/digital-id)\n[Hacking](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacking)\n[Hacktivism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacktivism)\n[Intelligence](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/intelligence)\n[Internet of Things](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/iot)\n[Laws and regulations](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/laws-and-regulations)\n[Malware](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/malware)\n[Mobile](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/mobile-2)\n[Reports](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/reports)\n[Security](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/security)\n[Social Networks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/social-networks)\n[Terrorism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/terrorism)\n[ICS-SCADA](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/ics-scada)\n\n\n-----\n\n[EXTENDED COOKIE POLICY](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/extended-cookie-policy)\n[Contact me](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/contact)\n\n\n-----",
