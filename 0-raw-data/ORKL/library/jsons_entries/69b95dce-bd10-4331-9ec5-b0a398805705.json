    "plain_text": "# #StopRansomware: Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities\n\n**Summary**\n\nNote: This Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an ongoing #StopRansomware effort\n\nto publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and\nvarious ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories detail\nhistorically and recently observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and\nindicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit\n[stopransomware.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware) to see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn about other\nransomware threats and no-cost resources.\n\nThe United States National Security Agency (NSA), the U.S. Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI), the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),\nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Republic of Korea\n(ROK) National Intelligence Service (NIS), and the ROK Defense Security Agency\n(DSA) (hereafter referred to as the “authoring agencies”) are issuing this joint\nCybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to highlight ongoing ransomware activity against\n[Healthcare and Public Health Sector organizations and other critical infrastructure](https://www.cisa.gov/healthcare-and-public-health-sector)\nsector entities.\n\nThis CSA provides an overview of Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)\n[state-sponsored ransomware and updates the July 6, 2022, joint CSA North Korean](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-187a)\n[State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Use Maui Ransomware to Target the Healthcare and](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-187a)\n[Public Health Sector. This advisory highlights TTPs and IOCs DPRK cyber actors used](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-187a)\n\nto gain access to and conduct ransomware attacks against Healthcare and Public\nHealth (HPH) Sector organizations and other critical infrastructure sector entities, as\nwell as DPRK cyber actors’ use of cryptocurrency to demand ransoms.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe authoring agencies assess that an unspecified amount of revenue from these\ncryptocurrency operations supports DPRK national-level priorities and objectives,\nincluding cyber operations targeting the United States and South Korea governments—\nspecific targets include Department of Defense Information Networks and Defense\nIndustrial Base member networks. The IOCs in this product should be useful to sectors\npreviously targeted by DPRK cyber operations (e.g., U.S. government, Department of\nDefense, and Defense Industrial Base). The authoring agencies highly discourage\npaying ransoms as doing so does not guarantee files and records will be recovered and\nmay pose sanctions risks.\n\nFor additional information on state-sponsored DPRK malicious cyber activity, see\nCISA’s North Korea Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage.\n\nFor a downloadable copy of IOCs, see AA23-040A.stix (STIX, 197 kb).\n\n**Technical Details**\n\nNote: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 12. See\nMITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced tactics and techniques.\n\nThis CSA is supplementary to previous reports on malicious cyber actor activities\n\n[involving DPRK ransomware campaigns—namely Maui](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-187a) [and H0lyGh0st](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/07/14/north-korean-threat-actor-targets-small-and-midsize-businesses-with-h0lygh0st-ransomware/) ransomware.\nThe authoring agencies are issuing this advisory to highlight additional observed TTPs\nDPRK cyber actors are using to conduct ransomware attacks targeting South Korean\nand U.S. healthcare systems.\n\n**_Observable TTPs_**\n\nThe TTPs associated with DPRK ransomware attacks include those traditionally\nobserved in ransomware operations. Additionally, these TTPs span phases from\nacquiring and purchasing infrastructure to concealing DPRK affiliation:\n\n  - **[Acquire Infrastructure [T1583]. DPRK actors generate domains, personas, and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583)**\n\naccounts; and identify cryptocurrency services to conduct their ransomware\noperations. Actors procure infrastructure, IP addresses, and domains with\ncryptocurrency generated through illicit cybercrime, such as ransomware and\ncryptocurrency theft.\n\n\n-----\n\n  - **Obfuscate Identity. DPRK actors purposely obfuscate their involvement by**\n\noperating with or under third-party foreign affiliate identities and use third-party\nforeign intermediaries to receive ransom payments.\n\n  - **[Purchase VPNs and VPSs [T1583.003]. DPRK cyber actors will also use virtual](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003/)**\n\nprivate networks (VPNs) and virtual private servers (VPSs) or third-country IP\naddresses to appear to be from innocuous locations instead of from DPRK.\n\n  - **[Gain Access [TA0001]. Actors use various exploits of common vulnerabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/)**\n\nand exposures (CVE) to gain access and escalate privileges on networks.\nRecently observed CVEs that actors used to gain access include remote code\n[execution in the Apache Log4j software library (known as Log4Shell) and remote](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-356a)\n[code execution in unpatched SonicWall SMA 100 appliances [T1190 and](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2021/12/08/sonicwall-releases-security-advisory-sma-100-series-appliances) [T1133].](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133)\nObserved CVEs used include:\n```\n    o CVE 2021-44228\n    o CVE-2021-20038\n    o CVE-2022-24990\n\n```\nActors also likely spread malicious code through Trojanized files for “X-Popup,” an open\nsource messenger commonly used by employees of small and medium hospitals in\nSouth Korea [T1195].\n\nThe actors spread malware by leveraging two domains: xpopup.pe[.]kr and\n```\nxpopup.com. xpopup.pe[.]kr is registered to IP address 115.68.95[.]128 and\nxpopup[.]com is registered to IP address 119.205.197[.]111.

After initial access, DPRK](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/)**\n\ncyber actors use staged payloads with customized malware to perform\nreconnaissance activities, upload and download additional files and executables,\n[and execute shell commands [T1083, T1021]. The staged malware is also](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083)\nresponsible for collecting victim information and sending it to the remote host\ncontrolled by the actors [TA0010].\n\n- **[Employ Various Ransomware Tools [TA0040]. Actors have used privately](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0040/)**\n\n[developed ransomware, such as Maui and H0lyGh0st [T1486]. Actors have also](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486)\n\nbeen observed using or possessing publically available tools for encryption, such\nas BitLocker, Deadbolt, ech0raix, GonnaCry, Hidden Tear, Jigsaw, LockBit 2.0,\n[My Little Ransomware, NxRansomware, Ryuk, and YourRansom [T1486]. In](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486)\nsome cases, DPRK actors have portrayed themselves as other ransomware\ngroups, such as the REvil ransomware group. For IOCs associated with Maui\nand H0lyGh0st ransomware usage, please see Appendix B.\n\n- **Demand Ransom in Cryptocurrency. DPRK cyber actors have been observed**\n\n[setting ransoms in bitcoin [T1486]. Actors are known to communicate with victims](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486)\nvia Proton Mail email accounts. For private companies in the healthcare sector,\nactors may threaten to expose a company’s proprietary data to competitors if\nransoms are not paid.

The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that\nCISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the\nCPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most\ncommon and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. For more\n\n\n-----\n\ninformation on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections, see\ncisa.gov/cpg.\n\nThe authoring agencies urge HPH organizations to:\n\n  - Limit access to data by authenticating and encrypting connections (e.g., using\npublic key infrastructure certificates in virtual private network (VPN) and transport\nlayer security (TLS) connections) with network services, Internet of Things (IoT)\n[medical devices, and the electronic health record system [CPG 3.3].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)\n\n  - Implement the principle of least privilege by using standard user accounts on\n[internal systems instead of administrative accounts [CPG 1.5], which grant](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)\nexcessive system administration privileges.\n\n  - Turn off weak or unnecessary network device management interfaces, such as\nTelnet, SSH, Winbox, and HTTP for wide area networks (WANs) and secure with\nstrong passwords and encryption when enabled.\n\n  - Protect stored data by masking the permanent account number (PAN) when\ndisplayed and rendering it unreadable when stored—through cryptography, for\nexample.\n\n  - Secure the collection, storage, and processing practices for personally\nidentifiable information (PII)/protected health information (PHI), per regulations\nsuch as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).\nImplementing HIPAA security measures could prevent the introduction of\n[malware to the system [CPG 3.4].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)\n\n`o` Secure PII/ PHI at collection points and encrypt the data at rest and in transit\n\nusing technologies, such as TLS. Only store personal patient data on internal\nsystems that are protected by firewalls, and ensure extensive backups are\navailable.\n\n`o` Create and regularly review internal policies that regulate the collection,\n\nstorage, access, and monitoring of PII/PHI.\n\n  - Implement and enforce multi-layer network segmentation with the most critical\n[communications and data resting on the most secure and reliable layer [CPG](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)\n8.1].\n\n  - Use monitoring tools to observe whether IoT devices are behaving erratically due\n[to a compromise [CPG 3.1].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, the authoring agencies urge all organizations, including HPH Sector\norganizations, to apply the following recommendations to prepare for and mitigate\nransomware incidents:\n\n  - **Maintain isolated backups of data, and regularly test backup and**\n**[restoration [CPG 7.3]. These practices safeguard an organization’s continuity of](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)**\noperations or at least minimize potential downtime from a ransomware incident\nand protect against data losses.\n\n`o` Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or\n\ndeleted), and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure.\n\n  - **Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan and**\n\n**associated communications plan that includes response procedures for a**\n[ransomware incident [CPG 7.1, 7.2].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)\n```\n    o Organizations should also ensure their incident response and\n\n```\ncommunications plans include data breach incidents response and\nnotification procedures. Ensure the notification procedures adhere to\napplicable laws.\n```\n    o See the CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS\n```\n[ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide and CISA Fact Sheet Protecting Sensitive](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/ransomware-guide)\n[and Personal Information from Ransomware-Caused Data Breaches](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Fact_Sheet-Protecting_Sensitive_and_Personal_Information_from_Ransomware-Caused_Data_Breaches-508C.pdf) for\ninformation on creating a ransomware response checklist and planning\nand responding to ransomware-caused data breaches.\n\n  - **Install updates for operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as**\n\n**[they are released [CPG 5.1]. Timely patching is one of the most efficient and](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)**\ncost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to\ncybersecurity threats. Regularly check for software updates and end-of-life\n[notifications and prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities. Consider](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\nleveraging a centralized patch management system to automate and expedite\nthe process.\n\n  - **If you use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), or other potentially risky**\n\n**[services, secure and monitor them closely [CPG 5.4].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)**\n```\n    o Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting\n\n```\nRDP and using virtual desktop infrastructure. After assessing risks, if RDP\nis deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources, and\n[require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) to mitigate](https://www.cisa.gov/mfa)\n[credential theft and reuse [CPG 1.3]. If RDP must be available externally,](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)\nuse a VPN, virtual desktop infrastructure, or other means to authenticate\n\n\n-----\n\nand secure the connection before allowing RDP to connect to internal\ndevices. Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after\na specified number of attempts to block brute force campaigns, log RDP\n[login attempts, and disable unused remote access/RDP ports [CPG 1.1,](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)\n3.1].\n```\n   o Ensure devices are properly configured and that security features are\n\n```\nenabled. Disable ports and protocols not in use for a business purpose\n(e.g., RDP Transmission Control Protocol port 3389).\n```\n   o Restrict the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol within the network to\n\n```\nonly access necessary servers and remove or disable outdated versions\nof SMB (i.e., SMB version 1). Threat actors use SMB to propagate\nmalware across organizations.\n```\n   o Review the security posture of third-party vendors and those\n\n```\ninterconnected with your organization. Ensure all connections between\nthird-party vendors and outside software or hardware are monitored and\n[reviewed for suspicious activity [CPG 5.6, 6.2].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)\n```\n   o Implement application control policies that only allow systems to execute\n\n```\n[known and permitted programs [CPG 2.1].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)\n```\n   o Open document readers in protected viewing modes to help prevent active\n\n```\ncontent from running.\n\n- **[Implement a user training program and phishing exercises [CPG 4.3]](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)** to\n\nraise awareness among users about the risks of visiting websites, clicking on\nlinks, and opening attachments. Reinforce the appropriate user response to\nphishing and spearphishing emails.\n\n- **[Require phishing-resistant MFA](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf)** **[for as many services as possible [CPG](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)**\n\n1.3]—particularly for webmail, VPNs, accounts that access critical systems, and\nprivileged accounts that manage backups.\n\n- **[Use strong passwords [CPG 1.4]](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)** and avoid reusing passwords for multiple\n\n[accounts.
