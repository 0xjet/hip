The1](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/01/global-dns-hijacking-campaign-dns-record-manipulation-at-scale.html)\ninformation allowed for the discovery of at least a subset of domains affected by this\ncampaign. CrowdStrike can confirm that numerous organizations in sectors such as\ngovernment, insurance, and civilian aviation, as well as internet service providers (ISPs)\nand infrastructure providers, were affected going back as far as February 2017.\n\n\nThe ultimate objective of this activity is currently unclear. However, DNS hijacking attacks\nwould allow the responsible actors to capture the contents of web traffic to affected\ndomains, during the time periods in which they were hijacked, and potentially use the\ncaptured data in follow-on operations. Given current information, CrowdStrike is unable to\nmake adversary or country-level attribution of this activity.\n\n## Malicious Infrastructure and Identified Targets\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on available information, CrowdStrike s [threat intelligence team has been able to](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)\nidentify 28 organizations in 12 different countries whose domains were hijacked. The\norganizations affected were primarily located in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)\nregion, but there was also a limited number of affected entities in Europe and the United\nStates.\n\n**TIMELINE OF MALICIOUS**\n**INFRASTRUCTURE AND HIJACKED**\n**DOMAINS**\n\n\n**Malicious IP Address** **Active Time**\n**Period**\n\n\n**Affected**\n**Organizations’**\n**Country (Sector)**\n\n\n142.54.179[.]69 February 2017 Jordan\n(Government)\n\n89.163.206[.]26 February 2017 Jordan\n(Government)\n\n\n185.15.247[.]140 December 2017\nand January 2018\n\n\nKuwait\n(Government)\nAlbania\n(Government)\n\n\n146.185.143[.]158 August 2018 UAE\n(Government)\n\n128.199.50[.]175 September 2018 UAE (Unidentified\nSector)\n\n185.20.187[.]8 September 2018 UAE (Law\nEnforcement)\nUAE\n(Government)\n\nLebanon\n(Government)\n\nLebanon (Civil\nAviation)\n\n82.196.8[.]43 October 2018 Iraq (Government)\n\n\n-----\n\n188.166.119[.]57 October 2018 and\nNovember 2018\n\n\nEgypt\n(Government)\nLibya\n(Government)\n\n\n206.221.184[.]133 November 2018 Egypt\n(Government)\n\n37.139.11[.]155 November 2018 UAE (Unidentified\nSector)\n\n199.247.3[.]191 November 2018 Iraq (Government)\nAlbania\n(Government)\n\n185.161.209[.]147 November 2018 Lebanon\n(Insurance)\n\n139.162.144[.]139 December 2018 Jordan\n(Government)\n\n37.139.11[.]155 December 2018 UAE (Unidentified\nSector)\n\n178.62.218[.]244 December 2018 UAE\n(Government)\nCyprus\n(Government)\n\n139.59.134[.]216 December 2018 Sweden (Internet\nInfrastructure)\nSaudi Arabia\n(Internet Services)\n\nLebanon (Internet\nServices)\n\n82.196.11[.]127 December 2018 Sweden (Internet\nInfrastructure)\nU.S. (Internet\nInfrastructure)\n\n\n46.101.250[.]202 December 2018\nand January 2019\n\n**Actor-owned Domains Used as Name**\n**Servers for Hijacked Infrastructure**\n\n\nSaudi Arabia\n(Government)\n\n\n-----\n\ncloudipnameserver[.]com\ncloudnamedns[.]com\nlcjcomputing[.]com\nmmfasi[.]com\ninteraland[.]com\n\nOnce hijacked, targeted domains ceased resolving to their normal IP addresses and began\nresolving to actor-controlled infrastructure. The actors would also create certificates for the\ndomains, primarily through Let’s Encrypt, a certificate authority that provides free X.509\ncertificates for TLS encryption. This would allow visitors to continue to establish trusted\nconnections, despite the fact that they were pointing at malicious infrastructure. Available\ndata shows that most affected domains were hijacked for very short periods of time,\nsometimes a day or less, with one domain showing resolutions to a malicious IP address for\nover a month.\n\n## Internet Infrastructure Providers Affected\n\nParticularly notable are a small number of domains owned by significant ISPs or\ninfrastructure providers. The affected ISP domains belonged to a private entity appearing to\nprovide services to a wide range of customers in all sectors, while another affected entity\nprovided services to government, research and academic organizations within its own\ncountry.\n\nTwo other affected organizations operate core functions of the internet globally, such as\ninternet exchange points, root DNS servers and numerous top-level domains (TLDs). A\ncompromise of internet infrastructure operators such as these could support data collection\nagainst a wide range of organizations.\n\n## Assessment\n\nWhile the precise objectives behind this DNS hijacking activity are unclear, this tactic could\nbe used by malicious actors to support a number of missions:\n\nDirect collection of data from web traffic to affected domains\nCollection of credentials from captured traffic for use in obtaining access to networks\nof future targets\nDelivery of malware from actor-owned infrastructure\n\nThis activity was likely meant to support intelligence collection operations against the\nentities whose domains were hijacked and possibly associated organizations likely to visit\nthose sites. In addition, the activity targeting the ISPs and infrastructure providers could\npotentially have supported information collection against a range of currently unidentified\ntargets.\n\n\n-----\n\nPublic reporting has indicated there are factors that point to a possible Iranian nexus for this\nactivity. While the CrowdStrike Intelligence team agrees that the heavy focus on affected\nMiddle Eastern governments would support the traditional intelligence collection interests of\nIran, there is currently not enough information to make any definitive assessment around\ncountry or adversary-level attribution at this time.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that given current information, it is unclear if this hijacking activity\nis linked to one or multiple actors. Considering the extended period of time over which this\nactivity took place and the variance in malicious infrastructure, it is possible that multiple\nentities were involved in carrying out this DNS hijacking.\n\n_1.
