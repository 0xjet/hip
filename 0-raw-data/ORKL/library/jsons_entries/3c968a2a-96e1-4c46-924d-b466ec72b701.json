This advisory provides details on the top 15 Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) routinely exploited by malicious cyber actors in 2021, as well as\nother CVEs frequently exploited.\nU.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cybersecurity authorities assess, in 2021,\nmalicious cyber actors aggressively targeted newly disclosed critical software vulnerabilities against\nbroad target sets, including public and private sector organizations worldwide. To a lesser extent,\nmalicious cyber actors continued to exploit publicly known, dated software vulnerabilities across a\nbroad spectrum of targets.\nThe cybersecurity authorities encourage organizations to apply the recommendations in the\nMitigations section of this CSA. These mitigations include applying timely patches to systems and\nimplementing a centralized patch management system to reduce the risk of compromise by malicious\ncyber actors.\n\nU.S. organizations: all organizations should report incidents and anomalous activity to CISA 24/7 Operations\nCenter at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870 and/or to the FBI via your local FBI field office or the FBI’s 24/7\nCyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov. When available, please include the following information\nregarding the incident: date, time, and location of the incident; type of activity; number of people affected; type\nof equipment used for the activity; the name of the submitting company or organization; and a designated point\nof contact. For NSA client requirements or general cybersecurity inquiries, contact\nCybersecurity_Requests@nsa.gov. Australian organizations: visit cyber.gov.au or call 1300 292 371 (1300\nCYBER 1) to report cybersecurity incidents and access alerts and advisories. Canadian organizations: report\nincidents by emailing CCCS at contact@cyber.gc.ca. New Zealand organizations: report cyber security\nincidents to incidents@ncsc.govt.nz or call 04 498 7654. United Kingdom organizations: report a significant\ncyber security incident: ncsc.gov.uk/report-an-incident (monitored 24 hours) or, for urgent assistance, call 03000\n200 973.\nThis document is marked TLP:WHITE. Disclosure is not limited. Sources may use TLP:WHITE when information\ncarries minimal or no foreseeable risk of misuse, in accordance with applicable rules and procedures for public\nrelease. Subject to standard copyright rules, TLP:WHITE information may be distributed without restriction.\nFor more information on the Traffic Light Protocol, see cisa.gov/tlp.\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nProduct ID: AA22-117A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nKey Findings\nGlobally, in 2021, malicious cyber actors targeted internet-facing systems, such as email servers and\nvirtual private network (VPN) servers, with exploits of newly disclosed vulnerabilities. For most of the\ntop exploited vulnerabilities, researchers or other actors released proof of concept (POC) code within\ntwo weeks of the vulnerability’s disclosure, likely facilitating exploitation by a broader range of\nmalicious actors.\nTo a lesser extent, malicious cyber actors continued to exploit publicly known, dated software\nvulnerabilities—some of which were also routinely exploited in 2020 or earlier. The exploitation of\nolder vulnerabilities demonstrates the continued risk to organizations that fail to patch software in a\ntimely manner or are using software that is no longer supported by a vendor.\n\nTop 15 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities\nTable 1 shows the top 15 vulnerabilities U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK\ncybersecurity authorities observed malicious actors routinely exploiting in 2021, which include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCVE-2021-44228. This vulnerability, known as Log4Shell, affects Apache’s Log4j library, an\nopen-source logging framework. An actor can exploit this vulnerability by submitting a\nspecially crafted request to a vulnerable system that causes that system to execute arbitrary\ncode. The request allows a cyber actor to take full control over the system. The actor can then\nsteal information, launch ransomware, or conduct other malicious activity.[1] Log4j is\nincorporated into thousands of products worldwide. This vulnerability was disclosed in\nDecember 2021; the rapid widespread exploitation of this vulnerability demonstrates the ability\nof malicious actors to quickly weaponize known vulnerabilities and target organizations before\nthey patch.\nCVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26858, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-27065. These\nvulnerabilities, known as ProxyLogon, affect Microsoft Exchange email servers. Successful\nexploitation of these vulnerabilities in combination (i.e., “vulnerability chaining”) allows an\nunauthenticated cyber actor to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable Exchange Servers, which,\nin turn, enables the actor to gain persistent access to files and mailboxes on the servers, as\nwell as to credentials stored on the servers. Successful exploitation may additionally enable\nthe cyber actor to compromise trust and identity in a vulnerable network.\nCVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-31207. These vulnerabilities, known as\nProxyShell, also affect Microsoft Exchange email servers. Successful exploitation of these\nvulnerabilities in combination enables a remote actor to execute arbitrary code. These\nvulnerabilities reside within the Microsoft Client Access Service (CAS), which typically runs on\nport 443 in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) (e.g., Microsoft’s web server). CAS is\ncommonly exposed to the internet to enable users to access their email via mobile devices\nand web browsers.\nCVE-2021-26084. This vulnerability, affecting Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center,\ncould enable an unauthenticated actor to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems. This\n\nPage 2 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-117A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nProduct ID: AA22-117A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nvulnerability quickly became one of the most routinely exploited vulnerabilities after a POC\nwas released within a week of its disclosure. Attempted mass exploitation of this vulnerability\nwas observed in September 2021.\nThree of the top 15 routinely exploited vulnerabilities were also routinely exploited in 2020: CVE2020-1472, CVE-2018-13379, and CVE-2019-11510. Their continued exploitation indicates that many\norganizations fail to patch software in a timely manner and remain vulnerable to malicious cyber\nactors.\nTable 1: Top 15 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities in 2021\nCVE\nCVE-2021-44228\n\nVulnerability\nName\nLog4Shell\n\nCVE-2021-40539\n\nVendor and\nProduct\nApache Log4j\n\nType\nRemote code execution\n(RCE)\n\nZoho\nManageEngine AD\nSelfService Plus\n\nRCE\n\nCVE-2021-34523\n\nProxyShell\n\nMicrosoft\nExchange Server\n\nElevation of privilege\n\nCVE-2021-34473\n\nProxyShell\n\nMicrosoft\nExchange Server\n\nRCE\n\nCVE-2021-31207\n\nProxyShell\n\nMicrosoft\nExchange Server\n\nSecurity feature bypass\n\nCVE-2021-27065\n\nProxyLogon\n\nMicrosoft\nExchange Server\n\nRCE\n\nCVE-2021-26858\n\nProxyLogon\n\nMicrosoft\nExchange Server\n\nRCE\n\nCVE-2021-26857\n\nProxyLogon\n\nMicrosoft\nExchange Server\n\nRCE\n\nCVE-2021-26855\n\nProxyLogon\n\nMicrosoft\nExchange Server\n\nRCE\n\nAtlassian\nConfluence Server\nand Data Center\n\nArbitrary code execution\n\nCVE-2021-26084\n\nCVE-2021-21972\n\nVMware vSphere\nClient\n\nRCE\n\nPage 3 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-117A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nProduct ID: AA22-117A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nVulnerability\nName\n\nCVE\nCVE-2020-1472\n\nZeroLogon\n\nVendor and\nProduct\n\nType\n\nMicrosoft Netlogon\nRemote Protocol\n(MS-NRPC)\n\nElevation of privilege\n\nCVE-2020-0688\n\nMicrosoft\nExchange Server\n\nRCE\n\nCVE-2019-11510\n\nPulse Secure\nPulse Connect\nSecure\n\nArbitrary file reading\n\nCVE-2018-13379\n\nFortinet FortiOS\nand FortiProxy\n\nPath traversal\n\nAdditional Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities\nIn addition to the 15 vulnerabilities listed in table 1, U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK\ncybersecurity authorities identified vulnerabilities, listed in table 2, that were also routinely exploited\nby malicious cyber actors in 2021.\nThese vulnerabilities include multiple vulnerabilities affecting internet-facing systems, including\nAccellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA), Windows Print Spooler, and Pulse Secure Pulse Connect\nSecure.

For patch information on CVEs\nidentified in this CSA, refer to the appendix.\no If a patch for a known exploited or critical vulnerability cannot be quickly applied,\nimplement vendor-approved workarounds.\nUse a centralized patch management system.\nReplace end-of-life software, i.e., software that is no longer supported by the vendor. For\nexample, Accellion FTA was retired in April 2021.\n\nPage 5 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-117A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nProduct ID: AA22-117A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\n\n\nOrganizations that are unable to perform rapid scanning and patching of internet-facing\nsystems should consider moving these services to mature, reputable cloud service providers\n(CSPs) or other managed service providers (MSPs). Reputable MSPs can patch\napplications—such as webmail, file storage, file sharing, and chat and other employee\ncollaboration tools—for their customers. However, as MSPs and CSPs expand their client\norganization's attack surface and may introduce unanticipated risks, organizations should\nproactively collaborate with their MSPs and CSPs to jointly reduce that risk. For more\ninformation and guidance, see the following resources.\no CISA Insights Risk Considerations for Managed Service Provider Customers\no CISA Insights Mitigations and Hardening Guidance for MSPs and Small- and Mid-sized\nBusinesses\no ACSC advice on How to Manage Your Security When Engaging a Managed Service\nProvider\n\nIdentity and Access Management\n\n\n\n\n\nEnforce multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users, without exception.\nEnforce MFA on all VPN connections. If MFA is unavailable, require employees engaging in\nremote work to use strong passwords.\nRegularly review, validate, or remove privileged accounts (annually at a minimum).\nConfigure access control under the concept of least privilege principle.\no Ensure software service accounts only provide necessary permissions (least privilege)\nto perform intended functions (non-administrative privileges).\n\nNote: see CISA Capacity Enhancement Guide – Implementing Strong Authentication and ACSC\nguidance on Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication for more information on hardening\nauthentication systems.\n\nProtective Controls and Architecture\n\n\nProperly configure and secure internet-facing network devices, disable unused or\nunnecessary network ports and protocols, encrypt network traffic, and disable unused network\nservices and devices.\no Harden commonly exploited enterprise network services, including Link-Local Multicast\nName Resolution (LLMNR) protocol, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Common\nInternet File System (CIFS), Active Directory, and OpenLDAP.\no Manage Windows Key Distribution Center (KDC) accounts (e.g., KRBTGT) to minimize\nGolden Ticket attacks and Kerberoasting.\no Strictly control the use of native scripting applications, such as command-line,\nPowerShell, WinRM, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and Distributed\nComponent Object Model (DCOM).\n\n\n\nSegment networks to limit or block lateral movement by controlling access to applications,\ndevices, and databases. Use private virtual local area networks.\n\nPage 6 of 20 | Product ID: AA22-117A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ\n\nProduct ID: AA22-117A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\n\n\nContinuously monitor the attack surface and investigate abnormal activity that may indicate\nlateral movement of a threat actor or malware.\no\n\no\n\n\n\nUse security tools, such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) and security\ninformation and event management (SIEM) tools. Consider using an information\ntechnology asset management (ITAM) solution to ensure your EDR, SIEM,\nvulnerability scanner etc., are reporting the same number of assets.\nMonitor the environment for potentially unwanted programs.\n\nReduce third-party applications and unique system/application builds; provide exceptions only\nif required to support business critical functions.\nImplement application allowlisting.\n\nRESOURCES\n\n\n\n\nFor the top vulnerabilities exploited in 2020, see joint CSA Top Routinely Exploited\nVulnerabilities\nFor the top exploited vulnerabilities 2016 through 2019, see joint CSA Top 10 Routinely\nExploited Vulnerabilities.\nSee the appendix for additional partner resources on the vulnerabilities mentioned in this CSA.\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe information in this report is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.
