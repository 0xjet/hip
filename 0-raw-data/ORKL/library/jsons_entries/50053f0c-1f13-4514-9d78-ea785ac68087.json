Although the Agent Tesla RAT has been around for at least 6 years, it continues to\nadapt and evolve, defeating many organizations’ security efforts. During the COVID-19\npandemic new variants have been introduced with added functionality, and the malware has\nbeen widely used in Coronavirus-themed phishing campaigns.\n\n## Agent Tesla | Background & Overview\n\nAgent Tesla is, at its core, a keylogger and information stealer. First discovered in late 2014,\nthere has been steady growth in the use of Agent Tesla over the last 1-2 years. The malware\nwas initially sold in various underground forums and marketplaces, as well as it’s very own\nAgentTesla.com site (now defunct) Agent Tesla, like many of its contemporaries, offered\nboth the malware itself as well a management panel for administration and data collection\nand management. Information harvested from infected devices quickly becomes available for\nthe attacker via the panel interface.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen originally launched, various ‘packages’ were available for purchase. Each package\nwas basically differentiated by the license duration and build/update access. At the time,\npricing was quite competitive with a 1 month license selling for $12.00 USD all the way up to\n6 month licenses going for $35.00. It is also worth noting that, like many other tools of this\nnature, cracked and leaked versions of Agent Tesla were quick to appear.\n\nEarly versions of Agent Tesla also touted the full suite of features as one would expect to find\nin a modern RAT, including:\n\nMulti Language Support\nPHP Web Panel\nAutomatic Activation upon payment (for direct customers)\n24/7 support\nStable and Fast execution\nMultiple delivery methods for keystroke logs, screenshots, and clipboard pulls\nSupport for multiple Windows versions (XP upward)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Delivery Mechanism\n\nLike many other threats, the primary delivery mechanism for Agent Tesla is email (phishing\nmessages). Attackers are often timely with their social engineering lures, and the current\npandemic is not off limits to the attackers. In the last few months, attackers have been\nobserved spreading Agent Tesla via COVID-themed messages, often masquerading as\ninformation information or updates from the WHO (World Health Organization)\n\n\n-----\n\nActors behind Agent Tesla campaigns have also used malicious Office documents to\nfacilitate first-stage delivery. Specially-crafted documents, exploiting Office vulnerabilities\nsuch as [CVE-2017-11882 and](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11882) [CVE-2017-8570, have been leveraged, even in present day](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8570)\ncampaigns. These and similar exploits allow for quick delivery and execution with minimal\nuser interaction (beyond opening the malicious documents and allowing active content to\nproceed)\n\n## Feature Set of New Agent Tesla Variants\n\nOver time, additional features have been added to Agent Tesla. These improvements include\nmore robust spreading and injection methods as well as discovery and theft of wireless\nnetwork details and credentials.\n\nCurrently, Agent Tesla continues to be utilized in various stages of attacks. Its capability to\npersistently manage and manipulate victims’ devices is still attractive to low-level criminals.\nAgent Tesla is now able to harvest configuration data and credentials from a number of\ncommon VPN clients, FTP and Email clients, and Web Browsers. The malware has the\nability to extract credentials from the registry as well as related configuration or support files.\nOur analysis of a swatch of current Agent Tesla samples reveals the following list of targeted\nsoftware:\n\n\n-----\n\n360 Browser\nApple Safari\nBecky! Internet Mail\nBlackHawk\nBrave\nCentBrowser\nCFTP\nChedot\nChromium (general)\nCitrio\n\n\n-----\n\nClaws Mail\nCoccoc\nComodo Dragon\nCoolNovo\nCoreFTP\nCyberFox\nElements\nEpic Privacy\nFileZilla\nFlashFXP\nFlock\nGoogle Chrome\nIceCat\nIceDragon\nIncrediMail\nIridium\nKMeleon\nKometa\nLiebao\nMicrosoft IE & Edge\nMicrosoft Outlook\nMozilla Firefox\nMozilla Thunderbird\nOpenVPN\nOpera\nOpera Mail\nOrbitum\nPaleMoon\nPostbox\nQIP Surf\nQualcomm Eudora\nSeaMonkey\nSleipnir 6\nSmartFTP\nSputnik\nTencent QQBrowser\nThe Bat! Email\nTorch\nTrillian Messenger\nUCBrowser\nUran\nVivaldi\n\n\n-----\n\nWaterFox\nWinSCP\nYandex\n\nHarvested data is transmitted to the C2 via SMTP or FTP. The transfer method is dictated\nper the malware’s internal configuration, which also includes credentials (FTP or SMTP) for\nthe attacker’s C2.\n\nCurrent variants will often drop or retrieve secondary executables to inject into, or they will\nattempt to inject into known (and vulnerable) binaries already present on targeted hosts.\n\nFor example, as we see in sample\n```\n4007480b1a8859415bc011e4981f49ce2ff7a7dd7e883fe70d9f304cbfefedea, a copy of\n\n```\nRegAsm.exe (dropped into %temp%) is subsequently injected into. That new instance of\nRegAsm.exe is then responsible for handling the brunt of the malicious activity (data\n[harvesting, exfiltration). We can also see frequent use of ‘Process Hollowing’ as an injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/)\nmethod. Process Hollowing allows for the creation or manipulation of processes through\nwhich sections of memory are unmapped (hollowed) with that space then being reallocated\nwith the desired malicious code.\n\nSome examples get a litte less creative with regards to process creation and subsequent\ninjection. For example, in sample\n```\nb74bcc77983d587207c127129cfda146644f6a4078e9306f47ab665a86f4ad13, we can\n\n```\nobserve it creating hidden folders and processes in %temp%, and using those hidden\nprocess instances for the primary infection routines, and as the persistent process (set via\nRegistry)\n```\n/c copy \"C:/Users/admin1/Desktop/tes_10.exe\" \"%temp%FolderNname.exe\" /Y\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n## Execution Behavior\n\nUpon launch, the malware will begin to gather local system information, install the keylogger\nmodule, as well as initializing routines for discovering and harvesting data. Part of this\nprocess includes basic WMI queries. Examples include:\n```\nstart iwbemservices::execquery - select * from win32_operatingsystem\nstart iwbemservices::execquery - select * from win32_processor\n\n```\nRecent samples, with the ability to discover wireless network settings and credentials will\nspawn an instance of netsh.exe after a brief sleeping period (after launch). The syntax\nutilized initially is:\n```\nNetsh.exe wlan show profile\n\n```\nPersistence is typically achieved via registry key entry or scheduled task.\n\nFor example, in sample\n```\n7ec2b40879d6be8a8c6b6ba239d5ae547604ad2605de0d2501a4cca25915afa1 a copy of\n\n```\nthe executable file is dropped into ~AppDataLocalTemp, and targeted w/ the following syntax\nto generate the persistent task:\n```\nSchtasks.exe /Create /TN \"UpdatesxjZWstBWrIuw\" /XML\nC:UsersxxxxxxAppDataLocalTemptmp1718.tmp\"\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nIn the sample\n```\nb74bcc77983d587207c127129cfda146644f6a4078e9306f47ab665a86f4ad13, we see an\n\n```\nexample of establishing persistence via the registry. Upon launch, an instance of the\nmalware is dropped into %temp% as a hidden file, in a hidden folder.\n```\n/c copy \"C:/Users/admin1/Desktop/tes_10.exe\" \"%temp%FolderNname.exe\" /Y\n\n```\nThe following command is then used to create the Autorun registry key:\n```\n/c reg add \"HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionWindows\" /v Load /t REG_SZ\n/d \"%temp%FolderNname.exe.lnk\" /f\n\n## Conclusion\n\n```\nAgent Tesla has been around for several years now, and yet we still see it utilized as a\ncommodity in many low-to-mildly sophisticated attacks. Attackers are continually evolving\nand finding new ways to use tools like Agent Tesla successfully while evading detection. At\nthe end of the day, if the goal is to harvest and steal data, attackers will go with what works;\nthus, we still see ‘commodity’ tools like Agent Tesla, as well as Pony, Loki and other lowhanging fruit malware being used. When combined with timely social engineering lures,\nthese non-sophisticated attacks continue to be successful. Detection and prevention are key\n[to reducing exposure to these threats. The SentinelOne platform is fully capable of detecting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhJGzfzymME&feature=youtu.be)\nand preventing Agent Tesla-based malware campaigns.\n\n## Indicators & IOCs\n\n\n-----\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK**\n[Modify Registry (T1112)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/)\n[Subvert Trust Controls: Install Root Certificate (T1553.004)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/)\n[Hide Artifacts: NTFS File Attributes (T1564.004)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/004/)\n[Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Search Order Hijacking (T1574.001)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001/)\n[Process Injection: Process Hollowing (T1055.012)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/)\n[Data from Information Repositories (T1213)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/)\n[Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder (T1547.001)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/)\n[Process Injection (T1055)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/)\n[Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files (T1552.001)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/001/)\n[System Information Discovery (T1082)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)\n[Query Registry (T1012)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012/)\n[OS Credential Dumping (T1003)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/)\n[Scheduled Task (T1053)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/)\n\n**SHA256**\n70aecc29ffb60caf068e4d8107f4d53fcdbd333bed7ac6fb3a852b00e86ded31\n7d1bcec8a3f71910e15cbb3adae945cd5096b7de259b51aef8f2e229bd4b40e2\n7ec2b40879d6be8a8c6b6ba239d5ae547604ad2605de0d2501a4cca25915afa1\n9b27388be292aea50d62cfebd130a9832f0d676feb28771d70d3e30bdb117f3a\na040efaf5dfac863805103ea0aa90a15b3690ad060188a15ea7d68491b274123\naa08d96a25908ce76e07475aefbbe192bd812665a5600dc30600688510dd033e\nbe26ad023b732078c42b4f95067fb9107fe88aebd7ebbf852e7e968e50eee8a0\n1abf66ab839c550bc77d97d1644c1225935a86b9591e9a95bcd606ebec6bbc19\nb74bcc77983d587207c127129cfda146644f6a4078e9306f47ab665a86f4ad13\nf44c6c8c1c81f9990f11a0f70e6517c358fc1ee00a78b32461d4a2594b48e47d\n9fee57918672137160499dcd1a099670ef8f9a787f3a1ad6d8123df26cddbc3b\n4007480b1a8859415bc011e4981f49ce2ff7a7dd7e883fe70d9f304cbfefedea\n590c19542f6959d6424107eb4f2998b04d035575341b1f23a40dea6d82aecadd\n648261052662b044dc233349ccdfa9dfd6853ec9a21ced386f8f172b2568b0d1\nf24018dead69b0f899d33e73f72f5c3ef6f3c391850484b06b042f36dbc08cac\n7ce7bf11f6285621381b80027c488e9b5009205131a89738975ccc89574a1533\ne2473526523180f460af4d8e164df9060c9f328cc7c0bae5846d51b28c12febe\n7adc0e8236262080e62c4bfb97e745880247f9e244ae8718e60cc217a3ae773b\n0107fadc185fd6b53dc033d4a79e53ef1621ae623917de029b6c02eeae2021c1\n388386f3361138514c561dcf6169e8f9e8726c91e2dc66663efb07bf21ece052\n507b63c73ba3bee19c8c8afb40526c1196240376277f4b49e25bedc5d866b980\n\n**SHA1**\na2ad3ec4cd2d70edf2bc9089c493f898b7da44a5\n8f841e8f7d2c3334145c8c9f89c8cd6929a06b2a\n3390272bb793ad15a45d647c3e5a716145fd262a\n8cd26c88b74f913f6e1c9d71a8d1e9aa53b7c6f6\n\n\n-----\n\n160c5583f9ba3d11e94a0dd8c9a64936981e8194\n859f498f0ba963e468a3912d936ad8e7ec01dbcd\n90fc8a737a7030db2e3583cbccb3156bb0a8ff12\n683efb5746e85867b5d613dc07a116a80becce58\n6c2d55f7fcecdcae779b148f0060b8ab4062e0a9\n7617dc78df626d5df43e38506fa7c577baef4bc5\n05d74461b2a63b75f319ef2c5c4aa074af4e97c3\n9e9c8ef7f20677795684b2749a59367cf5c3ec0a\n3e15c7c82b875c3553456dc08a8b79019cb48644\n7e674dd61f0802316bc092ffd44f5b8a36ab26d5\n7cf661644a638dcb554a81ba490ddcaee2ed6f12\n5b744ce5d3cccd556d66704d8fdde882ea928829\n94277994af62de5948d6de134edac0089a54b71e\n3ce8f4bfeb99fa2fb8898c7664ad3838ce4a4fcf\n4ffa900d7cf3ae6414bf90f6c9a4667cedfd57dd\n83be2722b7adc91bc3ee219b75e9176bc7ce8e6e\n72d3d907d7502c383ffc8239d255882838a5a6e4\n\n\n-----",
