The majority of them\nalready have in their arsenal powerful espionage malware and hacking platforms. We read\nabout the techniques and tactics implemented by a number of APT groups from China,\nRussia, Iran and belonging to the Five Eyes (US, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada)\nIntelligence Agencies.\n\nEarly in 2015, security researchers detected a new strain of malware, dubbed Babar, that\nthey consider as a malicious code developed by French intelligence. According to the\n[experts, Babar malware was used by the General Directorate for External Security (DGSE),](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate-General_for_External_Security)\nwhich is the [France‘s external](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) [intelligence agency, for surveillance and cyber espionage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency)\npurposes.\n\nThe spyware is also dubbed Snowglobe by the Canadian Intelligence agency CSEC, it was\nspyware designed to collect victims’ e-mails.\n\nThe General Directorate for External Security is controlled by the French ministry of Defense.\nIt is in charge of intelligence activities for the national security. The Casper malware was\ndiscovered by Canadian malware researchers that linked it to the French Intelligence.\n\nBabar is considered by the experts powerful spyware that is capable of eavesdropping on\nonline conversations held via popular messaging platforms, including Skype, MSN and\nYahoo messenger, as well as logging keystrokes and monitoring the activity of the victim on\nthe Internet.\n\nSecurity experts have collected evidence of the use of Babar to spy on several Iranian\norganizations, including nuclear research institutes and universities. Babar was also used by\nthreat actors to spy on European financial institutions. The name Babar first appeared in one\nof the documents leaked by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, the slides were made\nby the Canadian intelligence agency and linked Babar to the French Government.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 – CSEC slides leaked by Snowden_\n\nThe documents confirm the presence of the France’s intelligence services behind an e-mail\nspying campaign started in November 2009 that was aimed at Iran’s nuclear program.\nAccording to the French newspaper Le Monde, the hackers hit many other targets, including\na Canadian media outlet.\n\n_“Canadian secret service suspect indeed their French counterparts of being behind a vast_\n_computer piracy operation, which would have begun in 2009 and still continue thanks to a_\n_spy implant,” states Le Monde._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 -Canadian -Intelligence – Operation Snowglobe_\n\nThe presentation concludes with the revelation that CSEC agency has also detected a more\nsophisticated version of the Babar agent, dubbed Snowman, which is under analysis.\n\nThe slides were prepared in 2011 and shared among the Intelligence agencies belonging to\nthe Five Eyes.\n\nSnowglobe was detected in operation against targets in Canada, Spain, Greece, Norway,\nIvory Coast and Algeria, but the main target appeared to be in Iran. The hackers were\nfocusing on the country’s foreign ministry, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, the Iran\nUniversity of Science and Technology and two Tehran schools heavily involved in nuclear\nresearch, Malek-E-Ashtar University of Technology and Imam Hussein University.\n\nThe authors of the slides speculate that the French intelligence targeted Greece because it is\n“possibly associated with [the] European Financial Association,” and also Algeria and Ivory\nCoast because they are former French colonies.\n\n_“The memo outlines circumstantial evidence that led CSEC to conclude that Snowglobe was_\n_a French intelligence operation.” Continues LeMonde._\n\nThe researcher at CSEC are skeptical of possible financial motivation of the attackers, the\nexclude cyber-crime rings as the responsible of the campaign. Analysts noted that the\nmalware author left his username amid the computer coding: “Titi,” a French diminutive or\n_“colloquial term for a small person.”_\n\n\n-----\n\nOn March 2015, malware researchers spotted a new strain of malware, dubbed Casper,\nwhich is spyware designed to track Internet users for surveillance purpose. The malware was\nhosted on a compromised website belonging to the Syrian Government (at http://jpic.gov.sy/)\nit was a complex agent able to exploit two zero-day flaws to infect victims.\n\nBoth the exploits were hosted on a Syrian website, launched in 2011 by the Syrian Ministry\nof Justice that was designed as an online platform for citizens to complain about law and\norder violations. Experts believe it was designed to target Syrian dissidents complaining\n[about the government. The site was hacked in September 2013 by a group using the twitter](http://ae.aliqtisadi.com/%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%B1-%D9%8A%D8%AE%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%82-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%B9-%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9/)\naccount @olivertuckedout that raised the reaction of the hacking group known as the Syrian\nElectronic Army.\n\n_Figure 4 – olivertuckedout announced the hack of the Syrian Server_\n\n_Figure 5 – SEA replied @olivertuckedout_\n\n_“In mid-April we detected two new SWF exploits. After some detailed analysis it was clear_\n_they didn’t use any of the vulnerabilities that we already knew about. We sent the exploits off_\n_to Adobe and a few days later got confirmation that they did indeed use a 0-day vulnerability_\n\n\n-----\n\n_[that was later labeled as CVE-2014-0515. The vulnerability is located in the Pixel Bender](http://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb14-13.html)_\n_[component, designed for video and image processing.” reported an analysis published by](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/59399/new-flash-player-0-day-cve-2014-0515-used-in-watering-hole-attacks/)_\n_Kaspersky Lab._\n\nThe experts at Kaspersky noticed that both exploits were professionally designed, but while\none of them is standard and can infect practically any vulnerable computer, the second\nexploit (include.swf) only works on computers where Adobe Flash Player 10 ActiveX and\nCisco MeetingPlace Express Add-In are installed. The authors used the Flash Player Pixel\n[Bender component, which Adobe no longer supports, as the attack vector and remain active](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pixelbender.html)\nfor longer. This means that threat actors were running surgical espionage campaigns.\n\nCasper malware was used by threat actors in the wild to target systems, spy on them, and\ndrop other advanced persistent malware.\n\n_“According to the report, which Motherboard reviewed in advance, Casper was hosted on a_\n_[hacked Syrian government website in April of last year. The incident caught the attention of](http://securelist.com/blog/incidents/59399/new-flash-player-0-day-cve-2014-0515-used-in-watering-hole-attacks/)_\n_some security researchers because the attackers used two zero-day vulnerabilities to infect_\n_victims” states a_ _[blog post published by the Motherboard news portal.](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/meet-casper-yet-another-malware-likely-created-by-france-for-surveillance?utm_source=mbtwitter)_\n\nThe report published by Motherboard confirms that the Casper malware was designed by a\nFrench APT group, likely a state-sponsored hacking crew.\n\nCasper was used to run several espionage campaigns over the last few years and its\nauthors had access to two zero-day exploits that were used in a sample detected by\nmalware researchers in April 2014.\n\nCasper is not common malware; security researchers speculate it requested a significant\neffort for its development in term of resource and financial investment, a prerogative of\n[Government-built malware.](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/22677/malware/government-built-malware-cyber-weapons-will-run-control.html)\n\n**_Babar, Casper, and Evil Bunny have the same root_**\n\nMalware specialists have discovered several similarities between the source code of Casper\nand Babar, the researchers speculate that they were “likely” developed by the same team of\ncoders. The experts discovered much more, both agents appear as the product of a common\nhacking platform developed by French Intelligence that was used to distribute other\nmalicious code, including the Evil Bunny. In December 2014, the security firm Cyphort Labs\nfirm detected another sophisticated malware dubbed EvilBunny that implements a very\ncomplex evasion technique.\n\nTo establish that the same development team has worked on Bunny, Babar, and Casper the\nexperts focused the analysis on the identification of unusual stubs of code or algorithms\nimplemented by all the malware in the arsenal of the Animal Farm APT.\n\n\n-----\n\nEvilBunny is written in C++ and is able to detect installed antivirus and other defensive\nsolutions. It includes a Lua 5.1 interpreter, which allows the spyware to execute Lua scripts\nand change its behavior at runtime.\n\nThe experts discovered that EvilBunny is able to receive commands from the C&C server at\nleast in three different ways, via HTTP, through a downloaded database file or as a\nscheduled task.\n\nThe EvilBunny malware was initially delivered through a malicious PDF document, exploiting\nCVE-2011-4369. Once compromised the target the malware is loaded onto the system and\ninfects the PC with EvilBunny malware.\n\n_“The malware is dubbed ‘EvilBunny’ and is designed to be an execution platform for Lua_\n_scripts injected by the attacker.” According to the new report written by Joan Calvet, a_\n_malware researcher at anti-virus maker ESET, the EvilBunny together with other hacking_\n_tools, like the NBOT tool, suggested ties to the French Intelligence._\n\n_Figure 6 – Comparison between NBOT code and Caper code_\n\n_“We have reasons to believe that French intelligence has been using—or is even still using—_\n_at least four different malware families,” Marion Marschalek, another researcher who worked_\n_with Calvet and Paul Rascagneres in investigating the malware, told Motherboard._\n\nThe Animal Farm is a very prolific malware factory; Casper is just the latest tool in order of\ntime belonging to the arsenal of the Animal Farm group. Security researchers believe Casper\nhas been active since at least 2009 or 2010.\n\n_“Other security researchers agree that Casper, perhaps named after the famous cartoon_\n_“friendly ghost,” was likely created by the French government and its spying agency the_\n_General Directorate for External Security (DGSE). They refer to the hacking group as the_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Animal Farm because of each malware s animal-like and cartoon-inspired names._\n_continues the Motherboard._\n\nExperts at ESET firm collected the following evidence that suggests the involvement of the\nsame development team for the malware used by the Animal Farm group:\n\nCasper hides its calls to API functions by using a hash calculated from the functions’\nnames, rather than the names themselves, a technique implemented by other malware\non the Animal Farm, including NBOT and Babar.\n\nCasper, Bunny, Babar, and NBOT gather information about the running antivirus\nsolution in a similar way. The computer the SHA-256 hash of the first word of the\nantivirus name.\n\n_Casper generates delimiters for its HTTP requests by filling a specific format string with_\n_the results of calls to the GetTickCount API function. The same code is present in_\n_some NBOT samples._\n\nCostin Raiu, the director of the Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Labs,\nconfirmed that his company has been tracking the Animal Farm since 2013, the popular\nexpert has no doubts about the involvement of a government for the development of the\nmalicious code used by the APT group.\n\n_“When you have such a large-scale operation going on for several years using multiple zero-_\n_days without any kind of financial outcome,”Raiu told Motherboard, “it’s obvious that it’s_ _a_\n_nation-state sponsored—it has to be.”_\n\nFrance’s Defense Ministry did not respond to Motherboard’s requests for comment.\n\n## Another character from the cartoons … this time it’s Dino Malware\n\nSecurity experts at ESET have recently discovered a new sophisticated malware dubbed\n[Dino that experts believe linked to the arsenal of the Animal Farm ATP group.](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/34462/intelligence/babar-casper-french-intelligence.html)\n\nThe researcher that discovered and analyzed Dino, the new strain of malware used by the\nso-called “Animal Farm”, explained that it was detected for the first time in March 2014 when\nFrench media released a new collection of Snowden’s slides describing a campaign dubbed\n“Operation Snowglobe.”\n\nSeveral security firms, including ESET, Cyphort and G DATA, have analyzed in details the\nmalware belonging the Animal Farm APT. Below a list of the reports they published:\n\n[Casper, a stealthy first-stage implant, documented by ESET in last March](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/03/05/casper-malware-babar-bunny-another-espionage-cartoon/)\n[Bunny, a Lua-based backdoor, documented by Marion Marschalek (Cyphort)](http://www.cyphort.com/evilbunny-malware-instrumented-lua/)\n[Babar, an espionage platform, also analyzed by Marion Marschalek](http://www.cyphort.com/babar-suspected-nation-state-spyware-spotlight/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe arsenal of the Animal Farm includes Babar, EvilBunny, and Casper, but the list is long\nand NBot, Tafacalou (TFC / Transporter) and Dino are other malicious code used by the APT.\n\n[ESET published a detailed analysis of the Dino malware, the ESET researcher Joan Calvet](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/06/30/dino-spying-malware-analyzed/)\nhas detected a single sample of Dino in the wild that was used in an attempt to infect a target\nin Iran in 2013.\n\n_“Dino is so hard to find because the group behind the Animal Farm is really good at targeting_\n_people precisely, and we basically miss a lot of their samples,” Calvet told_\n\nDino is a modular malware, a number of components allow it to carry out several tasks, the\nagent is able to execute commands sent by C2C servers and Windows batch commands.\n\nThe malware is also able to search for specific files, upload files to the command and control\n(C&C) server, and download further files from the control architecture. The experts noticed\nthat Dino can also schedule commands to be executed at a specified time, it is also able to\nkill processes and uninstall the malicious code from the infected system to avoid leave traces\nof its presence.\n\nExperts at Kaspersky explained that the Tafacalou malware is used by the Animal Farm APT\nto serve further sophisticated spyware like Babar and Dino.\n\nThe researchers discovered several similarities between the code of the Dino malware and\nother threats from the Animal Farm malware families. The experts highlighted that the\ndevelopers of these malware families are French speakers.\n\nThe amount of shared code between Dino and the other Animal Farm malware is significant\nand leaves no doubt that Dino belongs to Animal Farm’s arsenal. Below the list of shared\nfeatures provided by the experts at ESET:\n\n_At the very beginning of Dino execution, the current process name is checked against_\n_process names used by some sandboxes, the feature allows it to avoid the execution in_\n_testing environments._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 – Dino checks to avoid execution in virtualized environments._\n\n_The call to API functions is hidden with the same hashing mechanisms implemented by_\n_other malware on the Animal Farm APT. The hash is calculated from the function’s_\n_name and used to look for the address of the API function._\n\n_The Dino’s custom file system – the so-called ramFS – is present in several droppers_\n_used by Animal Farm._\n\n_The output of Dino’s sysinfo command looks like an updated version of the “beacon”_\n_from the SNOWBALL implant described in the leaked CSE slides – part of operation_\n_SNOWGLOBE, which led to the discovery of Babar:_\n\n_“Dino’s binary contains a resource whose language code value is 1036. The original purpose_\n_of this language code is to allow developers to provide resources (menus, icons, version_\n_information…) fordifferent locations in the world in the corresponding language. Interestingly,_\n_when a developer does not manually specify the language code, the compiler sets it to the_\n_language of the developer’s machine. So, which language corresponds to the value 1036, or_\n_[0x40c in hexadecimal? French (France).” states the report published by the ESET.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd318693(v=vs.85).aspx)_\n\nAnother anomaly discovered by researchers is the presence in the file path of the word\n“arithmetique,” which is French for “arithmetic.”arithmetique,” which is French for “arithmetic.”\n\nExperts at ESET explained that the Dino malware, differently for other codes used by the\nAnimal Farm APT, doesn’t implement sophisticated anti-analysis techniques.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe information presented in this post reviews the findings of the reports prepared by the\nprincipal security firms that confirm the existence of a state-sponsored hacking group behind\nthe Animal Farm APT.\n\nAll the malicious codes share a large amount of code and appear developed by the same\npool of experts. The malware is very sophisticated and their development requested for sure\na significant effort. The analysis of Babar in the documents prepared by the Canadian CSEC\nindicates that the group is active at least since 2009, and the availability of zero-day exploits\nis another element that led the experts to consider the Anima Farm a Government-backed\nactor.\n\nIn the following table explains the principal malware that security experts linked to the group\nof Animal Farm.\n\n**Malware** **Function** **Further info**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Casper** Stealthy first-stage implant Casper was used against Syrian targets in\nApril 2014, which makes it the most recent\nmalware from this group publicly known at\nthis time. Casper has been active since at\nleast 2009 or 2010.\n\n\n**Evil**\n**Bunny**\n\n\nBackdoor The malware is written in C++, multithreaded, aims to detect installed antivirus- and firewall solutions and accepts a\nvast number of different control\ncommands.\n\n\n**Babar** Spyware that infects Windows\ndesktop machines and exfiltrates\ndata, including instant\nmessenger conversations,\nbrowsers, and office application\ndata.\n\n**NBot** Backdoor\n\n\nThe security firm Cyphort Labs firm\ndetected it in December 2014.
