Blackberry Cylance threat researchers have analyzed the Ratsnif trojans, which\noffer a veritable swiss-army knife of network attack techniques. The trojans, under active development since\n2016, combine capabilities like packet sniffing, gateway/device ARP poisoning, DNS poisoning, HTTP injection,\nand MAC spoofing.\n\nWe delved into four distinct Ratsnif samples, three of them developed in 2016, the fourth created during the latter\nhalf of 2018.\n\n## Sample 1\n\n**MD5** 516ad28f8fa161f086be7ca122351edf\n\n**SHA256** b4e3b2a1f1e343d14af8d812d4a29440940b99aaf145b5699dfe277b5bfb8405\n\n**Filename** javaw.exe, Client.exe\n\n**Path** X:\\Project\\BotFrame\\Debug\\Client.exe\n\n**Size** 1.32 MB (1,387,520 bytes)\n\n**File Type** PE32 executable for MS Windows (console) Intel 80386 32-bit\n\n\n-----\n\n**Alias** OceanLotus APT32 Ratsnif\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Time**\n\n### Overview\n\n\n2016-08-05 07:57:13\n\n\nThe earliest example of Ratsnif uncovered thus far was compiled on the same day that its C2 domain was first\nactivated:\n\nIt appears to be a debug build, and closely resembles a later variant from September 2016 that will be the main\nfocus of analysis for the three 2016 variants described in this article.\n\n## Sample 2\n\n**MD5** b2f8c9ce955d4155d466fbbb7836e08b\n\n**SHA256** b214c7a127cb669a523791806353da5c5c04832f123a0a6df118642eee1632a3\n\n**Filename** javaw.exe, Client.exe\n\n**Path** X:\\Project\\BotFrame\\Debug\\Client.exe\n\n**Size** 1.32 MB (1,387,520 bytes)\n\n**File type** PE32 executable for MS Windows (console) Intel 80386 32-bit\n\n**Alias** OceanLotus APT32 Ratsnif\n\n\n**Compile**\n\n**Time**\n\n### Overview\n\n\n2016-08-06 04:30:06\n\n\nCompiled less than 24 hours after the previous sample, this build contains only one minor difference in\nfunctionality, whereby a call to pcap_dump_flush() has been removed prior to recompilation:\n\n_Figure 1. Call to pcap_dump_flush in_\n_b4e3b2a1f1e343d14af8d812d4a29440940b99aaf145b5699dfe277b5bfb8405_\n\n_Figure 2.

This information will then be\nsent to the attacker's C2 server via an HTTP post to the /cl_client_online.php API endpoint. Next, a logging\nthread is created, which is used to route log messages to the C2 via HTTP POST requests to /cl_client_logs.php.\nThe malware then proceeds to load wpcap.dll, before importing the following functions:\n\npcap_sendqueue_transmit\npcap_findalldevs\npcap_freealldevs\npcap_open_live\npcap_sendqueue_alloc\npcap_next_ex\npcap_sendqueue_queue\npcap_sendpacket\npcap_close\npcap_sendqueue_destroy\npcap_dump_open\npcap_dump_ftell\npcap_dump_flush\npcap_dump_close\npcap_dump\n\nWith WinPcap successfully loaded, a further HTTP POST request is made to /cl_client_cmd.php, which is used\nto obtain a command code from the attacker. This code will check for commands every 10 seconds. C2\ncommands are decrypted using AES with a hard-coded static key via Windows APIs, before being dispatched by\na simple command processor.\n\n### C2\n\nAll observed Ratsnif samples have been hardcoded with one or more C2 domains, regardless of whether they\nare used. This sample contains 2 hard-coded domains, although only one appears to have ever been active:\n\nsearch[.]webstie[.]net\ndns[.]domain-resolve[.]org (inactive)\n\nThe C2 server itself is expected to expose a fairly intuitively named web API, supporting the following endpoints:\n\n**URL** **Description**\n\n/cl_client_online.php POST containing harvested system information\n\n/cl_client_cmd.php GET C2 command\n\n\n/cl_client_cmd_res\n\n.php\n\n\nPOST result of C2 command\n\n\n/cl_client_logs.php POST log message\n\nThe malware contains support for the following commands issued via the cl_client_cmd.php HTTP response:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Sample 4\n\n**MD5** 88eae0d31a6c38cfb615dd75918b47b1\n\n**SHA256** 7fd526e1a190c10c060bac21de17d2c90eb2985633c9ab74020a2b78acd8a4c8\n\n**Filename** N/A\n\n**Path** N/A\n\n**Size** 745 KB (762,880 bytes)\n\n**File Type** PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n**Alias** OceanLotus APT32 Ratsnif\n\n\n**Compile**\n\n**Time**\n\n### Overview\n\n\nWed, 08 Aug 2018 02:52:52 UTC\n\n\nSurfacing during the latter half of 2018 and wrapped in a bespoke OceanLotus shellcode loader, this sample was\n[first reported in a blog from Macnica Networks. Compared to the 2016 variants this sample introduces a](http://blog.macnica.net/blog/2019/04/oceanlotus-218a.html)\nconfiguration file and does not rely on C2 for operation. It also adds new features in the form of HTTP injection,\nprotocol parsing, and SSL hijacking.\n\n### Threat Features\n\nDeployed by OceanLotus loader\nUse of separately supplied configuration file, tailored to the victim’s network environment (as opposed to\nbackdoor commands in the previous versions)\nUse of separately supplied SSL certificates to perform SSL hijacking\n[Use of WolfSSL library (version 3.11) for decryption of SSL traffic (https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl)](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl)\nUse of http_parser.c for parsing HTTP traffic\n[(https://elixir.bootlin.com/zephyr/v1.13.0/source/subsys/net/lib/http/http_parser.c)](https://elixir.bootlin.com/zephyr/v1.13.0/source/subsys/net/lib/http/http_parser.c)\nPacket sniffing focused on extracting login credentials and other sensitive data via protocol parsing\nARP poisoning\nDNS spoofing\nHTTP redirection\nHTTP injection\n\n### Analysis\n\nFor this particular sample, the actual sniffer executable is Base64 encoded within a loader DLL and wrapped in\ntwo layers of shellcode. The loader DLL decodes the payload, copies it to memory and executes the 1 stagest\nshellcode, which will decompress the binary and execute the 2nd stage shellcode in a separate thread. The 2nd\nstage shellcode will inject the sniffer executable into memory and hook several API functions responsible for\n\n\n-----\n\nreturning the process command line (GetCommandLineA, GetCommandLineW, _acmdln, _wcmdln), so they\nreturn a hardcoded string instead. The string contains the parameter that specifies a path to the config file, as\nwell as the executable’s original path:\n\nC:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\api\\temp\\royal\\HkYh9CvH7.exe -p\nC:\\ProgramData\\setting.cfg\n\n_Figure 6. Embedded command-line_\n\nIt is not immediately obvious why the attackers used this convoluted method to pass the config path to the\nmalware.\n\nThe configuration file is a simple text file, Base64 encoded, where the first line is ignored, and each subsequent\nline specifies a parameter. For example:\n\n[unused_line]\n-ip [ATTACKER IP ADDRESS]\n-ga [DEFAULT GATEWAY]\n-subnet [SUBNET MASK]\n-sniff -ssl_ip [IP ADDRESS]\n-html_inject [BROWSER PROCESS NAME]\n-dlog_ip [IP ADDRESS]\n-mac [ATTACKER MAC ADDRESS] \"true\"|\"false\"\n-name [DOMAIN NAME] [REDIRECTION IP]\n-all\n-dnsttl [INT VALUE]\n-log [LOGFILE PATH]\n-pass [CREDENTIALS DUMP PATH]\n-dwn_ip [IP ADDRESS]\n\n_Figure 7. Configuration file options_\n\nHowever, there is a bug in parsing the value of the dwn_ip parameter, which will result in a memory read violation\nif the value is present in the configuration:\n\n_Figure 8: Bug in the code: the value of \"dwn_ip\" is passed as a string, while print_debug_msg expects a pointer_\n_to a string_\n\nOnce executed, the sniffer will read the configuration from the specified file, decode it using Base64 and parse it\nto an in-memory structure. If the \"-sniff\" parameter is specified in the configuration, the malware will add a firewall\nexception and disable Large Send Offload (LSO) for each network adapter in the registry:\n\nnetsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=\\\"Core Networking - Router Solicitation\\\" dir=in action=allow\nprogram={self_path} enable=yes\n\n_Figure 9. Command-line used to add Windows firewall rule_\n\nwmic path win32_networkadapter where index=%d call disable\n\n_Figure 10. Command-line used to disable network adapters prior to disabling LSOs_\n\nAfter importing the same APIs from wpcap.dll as the 2016 variants (with the addition of pcap_geterr), the\nmalware creates threads responsible for ARP poisoning and DNS spoofing.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to be able to decrypt the SSL traffic, the malware performs SSL hijacking, using an open source library\ncalled WolfSSL and separately supplied certificate and private key files. For that purpose, it creates an internal\nWolfSSL server, listening on the first available port in the range 65000 – 65535:\n\n_Figure 11: Use of WolfSSL_\n\nUnlike the 2016 variants of Ratsnif that stored all packets to a PCAP file, the 2018 variant employs multiple\nsniffer classes for harvesting sensitive information from packets. This will minimize the amount of data the\nattacker has to collect, exfiltrate and process, and also reveals what information the attacker is interested in.\n\nThe malware can sniff traffic for the following protocols/ports:\n\n\n**Interface**\n**Ports**\n\nCSniffFtp 21,\n990\n\n\n**Headers**\n\nABOR ACCT ADAT ALLO APPE AUTH CCC CDUP CONF CWD DELE ENC EPRT\nEPSV FEAT HELP HOST LANG LIST LPRT LPSV MDTM MIC MKD MLSD MLST\nMODE NLST OPTS PASS PASV PBSZ PORT PROT PWD QUIT REIN REST RETR\nRMD RNFR RNTO SITE SIZE SMNT STAT STOR STOU STRU SYST TYPE USER\nXCUP XMKD XPWD XRCP XRMD XRSQ XSEM XSEN 230\n\nCAPABILITY LOGOUT STARTTLS AUTHENTICATE LOGIN SELECT EXAMINE\nCREATE RENAME LSUB STATUS APPEND CHECK CLOSE EXPUNGE FETCH\nSTORE UID\n\nVarious\n\n\nCSniffImap\n\nCSniffLdap\n\n\n143,\n993\n\n389,\n636,\n10389,\n10636\n\n\nCSniffNntp 119 AUTHINFO USER AUTHINFO PASS ANONYMOUS 281\n\n\nCSniffPop 110,\n995\n\n\nRCEV RCVD RSET +OK USER PASS RETR QUIT\n\n\nCSniffSmb 445 Various\n\n\nHELO MAIL RCPT SEND SOML SAML VRFY EXPN TURN FROM\n\n\nCSniffSmtp\n\n\n25,\n465\n\n\nCSniffTds 1433 SELECT name, password_hash FROM master.sys.sql_logins where is_disabled = 0;\n-- priv\n\n23 Login Failed login: password:\n\nCSniffTelnet\n\n\nSniffHttp2 80,\n443\n\n\nVarious\n\n\n-----\n\nEach sniffer class interface contains two methods for extracting sensitive information from the incoming and\noutgoing packets, respectively. These typically rely on searching for cleartext header strings to facilitate\ncredential theft:\n\n_Figure 12. Searching for login and password commands in the Telnet protocol_\n\nIn addition, the HTTP sniffer interface is also able to perform injection to insert arbitrary attacker supplied content\ninto HTML.\n\n### C2\n\nAlthough this sample contains a Base64 encoded C2 URL hardcoded in the .rdata section (the same address as\nin the 2016 versions), the malware never seems to use it; instead, it logs the captured information into text files\nfor further exfiltration by another module.\n\n### Example\n\nTo recreate conditions in which the sample would operate, a default gateway was configured on 192.168.8.135\nand was running iNetSim to act as the DNS and HTTP servers. The attacker machine was located at\n192.168.8.134 and the victim at 192.168.8.138. Ratsnif was configured to operate as follows:\n\nTEST CONFIG\n\n-ip \"192.168.8.134\"\n\n-ga \"192.168.8.135\"\n\n-subnet \"255.255.255.0\"\n\n-sniff\n\n-ssl_ip \"192.168.8.254\"\n\n-html_inject \"iexplore.exe\"\n\n-dlog_ip \"192.168.8.254\"\n\n-mac \"00:0C:29:59:62:46\" \"true\"\n\n-name \"www.google.com\" \"192.168.8.135\"\n\n-dnsttl \"100\"\n\n-log \"C:\\ratsnif.log\"\n\n-pass \"C:\\ratsnif.pcap\"\n\n-dwn_ip\n\n_Figure 13. Configuration used for testing_\n\nFigure 14 shows the malware sending ARP packets asking for the MAC addresses of all the machines on the\nsubnet specified in the config file, whilst ignoring itself (192.168.8.134) and the default gateway (192.168.8.135):\n\n_Figure 14. ARP Broadcasts_\n\nFigure 15 shows the malware sending ARP packets asking for the MAC addresses of all the machines on the\nsubnet specified in the config file, whilst ignoring itself (192.168.8.134) and the default gateway (192.168.8.135):\nARP Broadcasts\n\nOnce it has MAC addresses for all machines on the subnet, Ratsnif will then send unsolicited ARP packets to\nthose addresses, updating the MAC address of the default gateway for each victim:\n\n_Figure 15. ARP Poisoning_\n\nFigure 16 shows the effect on the victim machine, with the attacker IP address and the default gateway IP\naddress (192 168 8 135) both now sharing the same physical address:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16. arp -a results showing poisoned ARP Table on the victim machine_\n\nOnce the ARP table is poisoned, all traffic destined for the default gateway will be routed through Ratsnif and can\nbe stored and manipulated prior to retransmission.\n\n[Finally, Figure 17 shows a poisoned DNS response for www.google.com, whereby the DNS query was](http://www.google.com/)\nintercepted by Ratsnif, modified to point to an attacker controlled IP address and the fake response sent to the\noriginal requestor:\n\nFigure 17.

It offers a rare glimpse of over two years of feature development, allowing us to observe how threat\nactors tailor tooling to their nefarious purposes. While all samples borrow heavily from open-source\ncode/snippets, overall development quality is deemed to be poor. Simply put, Ratsnif does not meet the usual\nhigh standards observed in OceanLotus malware.\n\n## Appendix\n\n Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n**Indicator** **Type** **Description**\n\n\nb4e3b2a1f1e343d14af8d812d4a29440940b99aaf145b5699dfe277b5bfb8405\nSHA256\n\nb214c7a127cb669a523791806353da5c5c04832f123a0a6df118642eee1632a3\nSHA256\n\nb20327c03703ebad191c0ba025a3f26494ff12c5908749e33e71589ae1e1f6b3\nSHA256\n\n7fd526e1a190c10c060bac21de17d2c90eb2985633c9ab74020a2b78acd8a4c8\nSHA256\n\n\nRatsnif\n\nRatsnif\n\nRatsnif\n\nRatsnif\n\n\nonceinstance Mutex Mutex name\n\nsearch[.]webstie[.]net Domain C2\n\n66.85.185.126 IP\nsearch[.]webstie[.]net\n\n\n-----\n\ndns[.]domain-resolve[.]org Domain C2\n\nX:\\Project\\BotFrame\\Debug\\Client.pdb PDB PDB Path\n\nntdata.tmp File Packet capture\noutput\n\n\nCore Networking - Router Solicitation\nWindows\nFirewall\nRule\n\n## MITRE\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Notes**\n\n\n7fd5…\n\n\nDiscovery [T1040](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040/) Network Sniffing Sniffs packets and saves to file\n\n\n[T1046](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1046/) Network\nService\nScanning\n\n[T1082](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/) System\nInformation\nDiscovery\n\n\nARP/SMB\n\nUser/computer name, system\ndirectory and workstation information\n\n\nCommand\nand Control\n\n\n[T1043](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1043/) Commonly Used Port HTTP/HTTPS\n\n\n[T1065](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1065/) Uncommonly\nUsed Port\n\n[T1001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/) Data\nObfuscation\n\n\n65000 - 65536\n\nRSA/AES C2 encryption\n\n\nImpact [T1493](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1493/) Transmitted Data Manipulation Performs packet interception,\nmodification and retransmission\n\nThe BlackBerry Cylance Threat Research Team\n\n## About The BlackBerry Cylance Threat Research Team\n\nThe BlackBerry Cylance Threat Research team examines malware and suspected malware to better identify its\nabilities, function and attack vectors.
