However, despite its obvious ties to one of the most wide-spread malware of the last two\nyears, Xenomorph is radically different from Alien in functionalities. This fact, in addition to the presence of\nnot implemented features and the large amount of logging present on the malware, may suggest that this\nmalware might be the in-progress new project of either the actors responsible with the original Alien, or at\nleast of someone familiar with its code base. However, this is only speculation at the moment.\n\n## Distribution\n\n[As we have previously discussed, threat actors are increasingly focusing their efforts into sneaking their way](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/deceive-the-heavens-to-cross-the-sea.html)\n[onto the Google Play Store (MITRE T1475).](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1475/)\n\nGoogle has seemingly taken some action to reduce the amount of malicious applications on the app market,\nbut often these efforts are not enough to stop criminals from reaching the store. As part of our daily threat\nhunting, ThreatFabric analysts encounter and report malicious applications on the store to Google.\n\nOne of the applications ThreatFabric discovered was posing as “Fast Cleaner”, an application aiming at\nspeeding up the device by removing unused clutter and removing battery optimization blocks. The application\nitself seemed successful, with more than 50.000 installations reported on Google Play. This is not an\nuncommon lure, and we have seen malware families like Vultur and Alien being deployed by such\napplication.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Upon analysis, we recognized this application as belonging to the Gymdrop dropper family. Gymdrop is a](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/deceive-the-heavens-to-cross-the-sea.html#alien-campaign)\ndropper family discovered by ThreatFabric in November 2021. Previously it was observed deploying a Alien.A\npayload. From the configuration downloaded by the dropper, ThreatFabric was able to confirm that this\ndropper family continues to adopt this malware family as its payload. However, contrary to the past, the\nserver hosting the malicious code also contained two other malware families, which were also returned\ninstead of Alien, based on specific triggers.\n\nFirstly, we observed samples belonging to a new wave of ExobotCompact.D, which has been living a new\nresurgence in the past few weeks, posing as Google play store applications, as well as different banking\napplications.\n\nHowever, despite being the first time we observed ExobotCompact.D and Alien.A being distributed by the\nsame dropper infrastructure, what surprised us the most was the presence of a totally new malware family.\nThis is how ThreatFabric discovered Xenomorph.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nHere is a comprehensive list of Xenomorph capabilities:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Accessibility Services\n\nThis Android Banking malware is heavily under development, and mostly supports the minimum list of\nfeatures required for a modern Android banking trojan. As discussed before, its main attack vector is the use\nof the overlay attack to steal credentials, combined with the use of SMS and Notification interception to log\nand use potential 2FA tokens.\n\nThe Accessibility engine powering this malware, together with the infrastructure and C2 protocol, are carefully\ndesigned to be scalable and updatable.\n\nThe information stored by the logging capability of this malware is very extensive, and if sent back to the C2\nserver, could be used to implement keylogging, as well as collecting behavioural data on victims and on\ninstalled applications, even if they are not part of the list of targets.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n       g g yp ();\n  switch(v0) {\n    case 1: {\n      UtilGlobal.Log(\"onAccessibilityEvent\", \"###  type: TYPE_VIEW_CLICKED\");\n      break;\n    }\n    case 2: {\n      UtilGlobal.Log(\"onAccessibilityEvent\", \"###  type: TYPE_VIEW_LONG_CLICKED\");\n      break;\n    }\n    case 4: {\n      UtilGlobal.Log(\"onAccessibilityEvent\", \"###  type: TYPE_VIEW_SELECTED\");\n      break;\n    }\n    case 8: {\n      UtilGlobal.Log(\"onAccessibilityEvent\", \"###  type: TYPE_VIEW_FOCUSED\");\n      break;\n    }\n     . . . \n    case 0x20: {\n      UtilGlobal.Log(\"onAccessibilityEvent\", \"###  type: TYPE_WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED\");\n      this.windowStateChangedEvent(arg4); // function responsible for injections\n      break;\n    }\n    case 0x40: {\n      UtilGlobal.Log(\"onAccessibilityEvent\", \"###  type: TYPE_NOTIFICATION_STATE_CHANGED\");\n      this.notificationStateChanged(arg4); // function responsible for logging notifications\n      break;\n    }\n    . . .\n  } \n\n```\nXenomorph seems to be in its inphancy stage, based on the fact that many commands are present in the\ncode of the malware, but are not implemented. In addition to this, the large amount of logging used also\nsuggests that this might be a in-progress malware project.\n\nDespite having so far a “in-progress” amount of features, Xenomorph contains code to support much more.\nIts Accessibility Engine is very detailed, and is designed with a modular approach in mind. It contains\nmodules for each specific action required by the bot, and can be easily extended to support more\nfunctionalities. It would be unsurprising to see this bot sport semi-ATS capabilities in the very near future.\n\nLike many other Android Banking trojans, this trojan heavily relies on the overlay attack mechanism to fool its\nvictims into revealing Personal Identifiable Information (PII), which could then be used by criminals to perform\nfraud. If the malware obtains the Accessiblity Services privileges, which it insistently requests after being\nstarted, it will automatically grant itself all the requires permissions and then silently execute on the device.\n\nHere are some screenshots of the request screens:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Modus Operandi\n\nThe main attack vector for Xenomorph is the classic overlay attack powered by Accessibility Services\nprivileges. Once the malware is up and running on a device, its background services receive accessibilty\nevents whenever something new happens on the device. if the application opened is part of the list of targets,\nthen Xenomorph will trigger an overlay injection and show a WebView Activity posing as the targeted\npackage. Here as a few examples of triggered overlays:\n\nThis feature is performed by the code you see in the snippet underneath:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n p () {\n  super.onStart();\n  this.context = this;\n  OverlayInjectResource v0 = UtilGlobal.getPackageInjection(this, UtilGlobal.SettingsRead(this,\n\"AITG\"));\n  this.resource = v0;\n  this.hideStop = true;\n  if(!this.stopActivity && v0 != null) {\n    try {\n      WebView v0_2 = new WebView(this);\n      this.wv = v0_2;\n      v0_2.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);\n      this.wv.setScrollBarStyle(0);\n      this.wv.setWebViewClient(new MyWebViewClient(null));\n      this.wv.setWebChromeClient(new MyWebChromeClient(null));\n      this.wv.addJavascriptInterface(new WebAppInterface(this), \"Android\");\n      String v3 = this.resource.getPageResource(this);\n      this.wv.loadDataWithBaseURL(null, v3, \"text/html\", \"UTF-8\", null);\n      this.setContentView(this.wv);\n    }\n    catch(Exception v0_1) {\n      v0_1.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    return;\n  }\n}\n\n```\nIn addition, the malware is able to abuse Accessibility Services to log everything that happens on the device.\nAt the moment of writing, all the information gathered is only displayed on the local device logs, but in the\nfuture a very minor modification would be enough to add keylogging and Accessibility logging capabilities to\nthe malware.\n\n## Targets\n\nAs a first step, the malware sends back the list of installed packages on device, and based on what targeted\napplication is present on the device, it downloads the corresponding overlays to inject. The list of overlay\ntargets returned by Xenomorph includes targets from Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Belgium, as well as some\n**general purpose applications like emailing services, and cryptocurrency wallets.**\n\n\n-----\n\n## C2 Communication & Commands\n\nFor its C2 communication, Xenomorph relies on the open-source project Retrofit2.\n\nRetrofit is a type-safe REST client for Android, Java and Kotlin developed by Square. The library provides a\npowerful framework for authenticating and interacting with APIs and sending network requests with OkHttp.\n\n**NOTE : ThreatFabric wants to explicitly mention that RetroFit is a legitimate and legal product. The**\n**developers that created this project have no control over the misuse of their software.**\n\nAfter obtaining Accessibility Services privileges, Xenomorph will first register and verify itself with the C2, by\nsending a request containing the following information at the endpoint ‘ping’:\n```\n{\n  \"api\":\"%DEVICE_SDK_NUMBER%\",\n  \"apps\":[\"%LIST%\",\"%OF%\",\"%INSTALLED%\", \"%APPS%\"],\n  \"imei\":\"%IMEI%\",\n  \"model\":\"%MODEL%\",\n  \"numbers\":[\"%LIST%\",\"%OF%\",\"%CONTACTS%\"],\n  \"tag\":\"%BOT_TAG%\",\n  \"uid\":\"%UID%\"\n}\n\n```\nThe messages are encrypted with an ever changing AES key and IV, together with an hash of the message\nto ensure the integrity of the communication. The first message sent to the C2 has the following format and\nuses an hardcoded testKey. The initial information exfiltrated about the device and displayed above is\ncontained in the tag ‘id’:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n{\n  \"hash\":\"%BASE64_ENCODED_SHA256%\",\n  \"id\":\"%ENCRYPTED_DATA%\",\n  \"iv\":\"%IV_FOR_AES%\",\n  \"type\":\"request_verify\"\n}\n\n```\nFollowing this exchange, the bot can be successfully registered and communicate with the C2. In this stage,\nthe malware will periodically poll for new commands from the C2, receiving the following response:\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"get_coms\",\n  \"coms\": [\"<COMMANDS>\"]\n}\n\n```\nThe value of ‘coms’ can be empty, or it can be any of the values described in the following section.\n\n### Commands\n\nThe following table contains all the accepted commands that can be sent from the C2:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\nsms_log Log SMS\n\nnotif_ic_disable Disable Intercept notification\n\ninj_list List injects\n\nnotif_ic_enable Enable notification intercept\n\nsms_ic_disable Disable SMS intercept\n\ninj_enable Enable Injects\n\napp_list Get installed apps list\n\nsms_ic_enable Enable SMS intercept\n\ninj_update Update list of injects\n\ninj_disable Disable injects\n\nsms_ic_update Not implemented\n\nsms_ic_list Not implemented\n\nnotif_ic_list Not implemented\n\nself_cleanup Not implemented\n\nnotif_ic_update Not implemented\n\nfg_disable Not implemented\n\nfg_enable Not implemented\n\napp_kill Not implemented\n\n### Endpoints\n\n\n-----\n\nHere is a list of the endpoints used by Xenomorph to communicate with its C2\n\n**Endpoint** **Description**\n\n/ping Used for initial verification step\n\n/metrics Used to retrieve commands from the c2 and send exfiltrated information\n\n## Similarities with Alien\n\nBoth choices of having a fully modular Accessibility Service engine and the use of Retrofit2 could remind of\n[another powerful Android Banking trojan, S.O.V.A.. However, despite this design similarities, the two families](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/sova-new-trojan-with-fowl-intentions.html)\nare completely different in implementation. On the other hand, there are many similarities with another\nAndroid Banking Trojan, which has been around for more than 2 years now: Alien.\n\nThe first similarity between these two families is the use of the same HTML resource page to trick victims into\ngranting the Accessibility Services privileges, which however has been re-used by many families before\nXenomorph.\n\nThis new malware also uses a very similar style of state-tracking through the use of the ‘SharedPreferences’\nfile. This file is commonly used to track the state of an application. However, the style of variable naming used\nby Xenomorph is very reminiscent of Alien, despite being potentially even more detailed.\n\nPotentially the most interesting fact is the actual name of the sharedPreferences file used to store the\nconfiguration for Xenomorph: the file is named ring0.xml.\n\nThis might look like any other generic random string, but it happens to coincide with the name of the\n[supposed actor behind the development of the original Alien malware.](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/alien_the_story_of_cerberus_demise.html#the-revelation)\n\nIf this could look like a coincidence, there are many occurences of very peculiar logging strings and class\nnames observed first in Cerberus, and later in its successor Alien.\n\n\n-----\n\nCurrently the set of capabilities of Alien is much larger than the one of Xenomorph. However, considering that\nthis new malware is still very young and adopts a strong modular design, it is not hard to predict new features\ncoming in the near future.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe surfacing of Xenomorph shows, once again, that threat actors are focusing their attention on landing\napplications on official markets. This is also a signal that the underground market for droppers and\ndistribution actors has increased its activity, considering that we just very recently observed Medusa and\nCabassous also being distributed side-by-side.\n\nXenomorph currently is an average Android Banking Trojan, with a lot of untapped potential, which could be\nreleased very soon. Modern Banking malware is evolving at a very fast rate, and criminals are starting to\nadopt more refined development practices to support future updates. Xenomorph is at the forefront of this\nchange.\n\nThe current version of Xenomorph is capable of abusing Accessibility Services to steal PII from unaware\nvictims, prevent uninstallation and intercept SMS and notifications. ThreatFabric predicts that with some more\ntime to finish development, this malware could reach higher threat levels, comparable to other modern\nAndroid Banking trojans.\n\n## MTI & CSD\n\nThis and other mobile malware is tracked in our Mobile Threat Intel service (MTI).
