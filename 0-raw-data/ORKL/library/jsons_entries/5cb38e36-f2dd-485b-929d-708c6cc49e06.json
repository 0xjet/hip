Now it is continuously\nexpanding its activity since then. We have been tracking this RAT for a long time and\nobserved an increase in targeting the Indian government agencies.\n\nThe CetaRAT infection chain starts with a Spear phishing mail with a malicious mail\nattachment. The attachment can be a zip file that downloads an HTA file from a remote,\ncompromised URL. Once this HTA file is executed using mshta.exe, it drops and executes\nthe CetaRAT payload that starts the CnC activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter HTA file execution, we observed two different behaviours:\n\nIn the first method, it creates & executes the JavaScript file at the “C:\\\\ProgramData”\nlocation. The script code opens the decoy document, which is related to government topics\nand notifications. At the same time, CetaRAT executable payload is dropped at the Startup\nlocation and, the script operation can sleep for some duration and restart the machine.\n\nFig 1. JavaScript code.\n\nThe second method observed, creating and running batch files at random name folder on C\ndrive on the victim’s machine, which contains the instructions to add registry entry at\n“HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” with the path of CetaRAT\nexecutable payload. In this variant, the executable is dropped at %AppData/Roaming%\nlocation.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 2. Decoy document.\n\nFig 3. Decoy document\n\nThe CetaRAT is C#-based RAT family which exfiltrates the data from the user and sends it to\nthe CnC server. Once it is executed, first, it will check the running AV product details from the\nmachine with function Getans() and send details to the CnC server.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 4. Get AV details from Machine.\n\nFunction Start() uses the get details from machines like computer name, OS details, IP\naddress, memory details, running processor, etc., and uploads it to CnC Server. This data is\nencrypted before uploading it to CnC.\n\nFig 5. Get all details from Machine.\n\nThe GetIP() function is used in this RAT activity to get the running machine’s IP information.\nHere domain “checkip.dydnd.org” is used for this purpose. This function returns the\nmachine’s IP address.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 6. Get IP details.\n\nIn the next activity, the RAT uses commands to exfiltrate the data and for file operations,\nbelow are commands details\nDownload- use download data\nUpload- Upload the data to the CnC server.\nDownload .exe- it is used for download and then executing the file.\nCreated- for creating the directory on the system.\nRename- use for rename file\nDelete- use for delete file or data.\nScreen- take a screenshot of the system\nRun- used for running the code.\nShellexe- used for executing the payload\nProcess- information of techniques.\nPkill- To kill the running process.\nList- list of processes.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 7. Commands are used to exfiltrate data.\n\nAfter gathering information from the user’s machine, CetaRAT uses the RC4 algorithm to\nencrypt data before uploading it to the CnC server.\n\nFig 8. Use RC4 encryption\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the data is encrypted, it will exfiltrate to the CnC server using the POST HTTP method.\nWe can see three CnC server IPs mentioned in the code below, with the keyword “ceta”.\n\nFig 9. CnC servers.\n\nFig 10. Wireshark capture traffic.\n\n**IOCs-> (MD5)**\n\n**HTA File-**\n\n9DEF22BE73D2713600B689F3074F3841\n849CA729063AAAD53BC743A7D476C63E\n0BA023D0CD30E77001A78B4CBA017ADE\n\n**CetaRAT Payload-**\n\n532ACBADB8151944650AAECC0A397965\n0058B40AEA4B981E0FC619250FC64EA3\n04213947D30FC4205A0C4D0674A27151\n\n**JS/Batch Payload-**\n\n\n-----\n\n4B85ADE5E9790BDC63B80AD8EF853D40\n6F0672BBD0700AC61D1EDF201C4CABFF\n6DC67068A93E05A35E90CF066F33B79E\n\n**Decoy documents-**\n\n5AA26DCD3CA84DB8963688BE491E8ABE\nF509CF7605566EE74DE5AABF7FEF3C61\n\n**IPs-**\n\n207.180.230.63\n164.68.104.126\n164.68.108.22\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCetaRAT is Exfiltrating data that simply deliver mechanisms and aggressively infect the\nvictim. It might leak sensitive data from a government organization, which impacts harmful\nactivities in the countries. We recommend our customers not to access suspicious\nemails/attachments and keep their AV software up-to-date to protect their systems from such\ncomplex malware.\n\n**Prashant Tilekar**\n\n[Follow @](https://twitter.com/)\n\n\n-----",
