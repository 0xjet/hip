Many researchers - including us - were unable to](https://twitter.com/JAMESWT_MHT/status/743345104333606912)**\n\n**identify the malware so we decided to dig a bit further.**\n\n**In this post, we will share our findings about this malware: its targets, technical analysis, the related�**\n\n**attacks and the threat actor behind it.**\n\n## Targets\n\n**One of the first things we wanted to know is if this malware has a specific target–thanks to researcher�**\n\n**[@benkow_ some open directories on the malware C&C were discovered. One of the open directories](https://twitter.com/benkow_)**\n\n**contained logs of victim IPs and computer names:**\n\n**While there are not that many IP victims logged on this particular C&C, a look-up on** **_ipintel.io showed_**\n\n**a concentration of victims from Germany and Austria:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Incidentally, a quick dump of the malware code reveals the string “my_de” and “my_botnet” where the**\n\n**“de” in the first string may refer to Germany’s country code:�**\n\n**Due to this and the results of our analysis below, we tagged this malware DELoader (detected as**\n\n**W32/DELoader.A!tr).**\n\n## DELoader Analysis\n\n**In a nutshell, DELoader’s primary purpose is to load additional malware on the system. It does this by**\n\n**initially creating a suspended explorer.exe process:**\n\n**It then proceeds to decrypt an embedded DLL from its body and inject it into explorer.exe:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The injected DLL then attempts to download a file from the link�**\n\n**hxxp://remembermetoday4.asia/00/b.bin:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Upon the time of analysis, the malware C&C was already sinkholed. Code-wise, the malware expects**\n\n**to download a portable executable (PE) file as it validates the MZ header of the downloaded file. If�**\n\n**valid, this PE file is then copied to a newly allocated memory:�**\n\n**It then searches for instance of a running explorer.exe process where it then injects the downloaded**\n\n**file using �CreateRemoteThread API:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**DELoader’s routine doesn’t tell much about its intentions since its payload simply installs an additional**\n\n**PE file. This PE file could be any malware, or simply an updated copy of itself.�**\n\n**Either way, it leads us to the next question – what is the motive behind DELoader?**\n\n## Related Attacks\n\n**The registrant information of the malware C&C, resdomactivationa.asia, leads us to the next clue:**\n\n**The registrant details list someone named Aleksandr Sirofimov� from Russia. Of course, we certainly**\n\n**don’t know if Aleksandr is a real person, a stolen identity, an alias for a group, or the ‘nom de guerre’**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Below is an overview of some of the related attacks we were able to correlate using the email**\n\n**address sir777alex@outlook.com:**\n\n**From the above graph we can extract the infection chain for DELoader, which is delivered through**\n\n**malicious JavaScript downloaders:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Furthermore, the above correlation enabled us to identify that the actor (or actors), using the name**\n\n**rd**\n\n**“Aleksandr,” registered malicious domains as early as the 3** **quarter of 2015, while DELoader first�**\n\n**surfaced by at least February of 2016.**\n\n**One of the malicious tools “Aleksandr” used is a Zeus variation – an infamous banking Trojan whose**\n\n**[source code was leaked five years ago. Here is a graph of some of the related Zeus variants out of the�](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/the-zeus-source-code-leaked-now-what/)**\n\n**many Zeus C&C domains “Aleksandr” registered:**\n\n**[An online search of the domain goodvin77787.in leads us to this blog. The blog talks about a DHL-](https://rebsnippets.blogspot.com.br/2015/11/dhl-themed-zeus-campaign-is-using.html)**\n\n**themed Zeus campaign targeting German-speaking users where all the related Zeus C&Cs were**\n\n**registered using “Aleksandr’s” details.**\n\n**So we now know that person or persons behind “Aleksandr” have been (or are still) involved in a**\n\n**malicious campaign for stealing banking credentials. True to the nature of DELoader, the previous**\n\n**campaign also targeted German-speaking users.**\n\n## Are German-Speaking Users \"Aleksandr’s\" Only Target?\n\n**Another domain the individual or group known as “Aleksandr” registered is** **bestbrowser-2015.biz.**\n\n**This domain was used as a C&C server for Android Marcher variants – an Android banking Trojan**\n\n**sold on Russian underground forums:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Interestingly, these trojans were configured to steal credentials from �Australian banks. Below is a code**\n\n**snippet from one of the Android Marcher samples:**\n\n**It is worth noting that these Marcher variants surfaced around the same time “Aleksandr” was running**\n\n**rd** **th**\n\n**Zeus campaigns in the 3** **and 4** **quarter of 2015. This suggests that he was running his malicious**\n\n**regional campaigns simultaneously.**\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**While DELoader is a relatively new malware, the findings in this research demonstrate that the threat�**\n\n**actor behind it has actually been around for quite some time, and has left a substantial amount of**\n\n**fingerprints over the Internet.�**\n\n**Historical information shows that the individual or group using the name “Aleksandr” have been**\n\n**involved in bank information theft not only of German-speaking users, but have also targeted**\n\n**Australian users. It is possible that DELoader may be used to aid in similar purposes in the future.**\n\n**We are unable to confirm the legitimacy of “Aleksandr’s” registrant details, or if he (or they) is working�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Earlier, we showed that the geolocations of DELoader victims were concentrated in Germany and**\n\n**Austria. You might have also noticed that one of the IPs deviated from that area – it resolved**\n\n**to Kiev,Ukraine:**\n\n**This is odd since German is not a common language in Ukraine. So we theorized that this anomalous**\n\n**event may be due to someone testing the DELoader.**\n\n**To test our theory, we looked up the IP in the C&C logs to find more information. Can you find the�**\n\n**interesting string in the IP’s computer name below?**\n\n**High five if you found “ALEXANDR”.�**\n\n**-= FortiGuard Lion Team =-**\n\n**_IOCs_**\n\n**_DELoader SHA-256 hashes (all detected as W32/DELoader.A!tr):_**\n\n**_72faed0bc66afe1f42bd7e75b7ea26e0596effac65f67c0ac367a84ec4858891�_**\n\n**_5d759710686db2c5b81c7125aacf70e252de61ab360d95e46cee8a9011c5693f_**\n\n**_c16281c83378a597cbc4b01410f997e45b89c5d06efada8000ff79c3a24d63ca�_**\n\n**_171693ab13668c6004a1e08b83c9877a55f150aaa6d8a624c3f8ffc712b22f0b�_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_cec73c7b54c290b297a713e0eb07c7c2d822cc67ed61b9981256464273d63892_**\n\n**_Domains registered by sir777alex@outlook.com:_**\n\n**_yberprojects22017.info_**\n\n**_masterhost8981.asia_**\n\n**_nov15mailmarketing.in_**\n\n**_auspostresponse22.asia_**\n\n**_goodwinn8.asia_**\n\n**_mastehost12312.asia_**\n\n**_masterhost1333.asia_**\n\n**_marketingmas.in.net_**\n\n**_remembermetoday4.asia_**\n\n**_startupproject33676.asia_**\n\n**_bestbrowser-2015.biz_**\n\n**_marketing5050.asia_**\n\n**_marketingking878.asia_**\n\n**_yidckntbrmhuuhmq.com_**\n\n**_resdomactivationa.asia_**\n\n**_ukcompanymarketing.asia_**\n\n**_goodvin77787.in_**\n\n**_jajajakala8212.asia_**\n\n**_masterhost122133.asia_**\n\n**_masterj.in_**\n\n**_lalalababla.asia_**\n\n**_responder201922.asia_**\n\n**_cyberprojects2727.info_**\n\n**_super-sexy-girl2015.net_**\n\n**_jxsraxhlccokkrob.com_**\n\n**_mastehost88832.asia_**\n\n**_masterlin888.pw_**\n\n**_mamba777.in_**\n\n**_copolsox.us_**\n\n**_10cyberprojects2016.asia_**\n\n**_startupproject336.asia_**\n\n**_masterhost122133.asia_**\n\n**by** **Floser Bacurio and Roland Dela Paz | Jun 21, 2016 | Filed in: Security Research**\n\n**Tags:** **zeus banking trojan** **zbot** **bank fraud** **DELoader** **Android Marcher**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Previous Post: Securing Critical Infrastructures**\n\n\n**Recommend**\n\n\n**Share** **Sort by Best**\n\n\n### Start the discussion…\n\n\n**Corporate**\n\n**[About Fortinet](http://fortinet.com/aboutus/aboutus.html)**\n\n**[Investor Relations](http://investor.fortinet.com)**\n\n**[Careers](http://jobs.fortinet.com)**\n\n**[Partners](http://fortinet.com/partners/index.html)**\n\n**[Global Offices�](http://fortinet.com/aboutus/locations.html)**\n\n**[Fortinet in the News](http://fortinet.com/aboutus/media/news.html)**\n\n**[Contact Us](http://fortinet.com/contact_us/index.html)**\n\n**How to Buy**\n\n**[Find a Reseller](http://fortinet.com/partners/reseller_locator/locator.html)**\n\n**[FortiPartner Program](http://fortinet.com/partners/partner_program/fpp.html)**\n\n**[Fortinet Store](https://store.fortinet.com)**\n\n**Products**\n\n**[Product Family](http://fortinet.com/products/index.html)**\n\n**[Certifications�](http://fortinet.com/aboutus/fortinet_advantages/certifications.html)**\n\n**[Awards](http://fortinet.com/aboutus/fortinet_advantages/awards.html)**\n\n**[Video Library](http://video.fortinet.com)**\n\n**Service & Support**\n\n**[FortiCare Support](http://fortinet.com/support/forticare_support/index.html)**\n\n**[Support Helpdesk](https://support.fortinet.com)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Copyright © 2000 - 2016 Fortinet, Inc.
