Naikon plays a key part in our story, but the focus of this report is on another threat actor\nentirely; one who came to our attention when they hit back at a Naikon attack.\n\nNaikon is known for its custom backdoor, called RARSTONE, which our colleagues at Trend Micro have\ndescribed in detail. The name Naikon comes from a custom user agent string, \"NOKIAN95/WEB\",\nlocated within the backdoor:\n\n_NOKIAN string in Naikon backdoor_\n\nThe Naikon group is mostly active in countries such as the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia,\nVietnam, Myanmar, Singapore, and Nepal, hitting a variety of targets in a very opportunistic way. What\nwas perhaps one of the biggest operations of the Naikon group was launched in March 2014, in the\nwake of the MH370 tragedy that took place on March 8th. By March 11th, the Naikon group was actively\nhitting most of the nations involved in the search for MH370. The targets were extremely wide­ranging\nbut included institutions with access to information related to the disappearance of MH370, such as:\n\nOffice of the President\nArmed Forces\nOffice of the Cabinet Secretary\nNational Security Council(s)\nOffice of the Solicitor General\nNational Intelligence Coordinating Agency\nCivil Aviation Authority\n\n\n-----\n\nPresidential Management Staff\n\nThe Naikon group used mostly spear­phished documents for the attacks, with CVE­2012­0158 exploits\nthat dropped the group's signature backdoor.\n\n**While many of these attacks were successful, at least one of the targets didn't seem to like being**\n**hit, and instead of opening the documents, decided on a very different course of action.**\n\n## The empire strikes back\n\nHere's a question ­ what should you do when you receiving a suspicious document from somebody you\ndon't know, or know very little? Choose one:\n\nOpen the document\nDon't open the document\nOpen the document on a Mac (everybody knows Mac's don't get viruses)\nOpen the document in a virtual machine with Linux\n\nBased on our experience, most people would say 2, 3 or 4. Very few would open the document and\neven fewer would actually decide to test the attacker and verify its story.\n\nBut this is exactly what happened when one of the Naikon spear­phishing targets received a suspicious\nemail. Instead of opening the document or choosing to open it on an exotic platform, they decided to\ncheck the story with the sender:\n\n_Naikon target asks for confirmation of the email_\n\nIn the email above, we can see the target questioning the authenticity of the Naikon spear­phishing.\nThey ask the sender if it was their intention to email this document.\n\nThe attacker was, of course, not confused in the slightest, and being very familiar with the internal\nstructure of the target's government agency, replied claiming that they work for the secretariat division\nand were instructed to send it by the organization's management:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Naikon attacker replies to the target_\n\nThe reply is written in poor English and indicates that the attacker is probably not as proficient in the\nlanguage as the intended victim. Seeing the reply, the target obviously decided not to open the\ndocument. Moreover, they decided to go a bit further and try to learn more about the attacker.\n\nNot long after the first exchange, the following email was sent to the attacker by the target:\n\nThe attachment is a RAR archive with password, which allows it to safely bypass malware scanners\nassociated with the free email account used by the attackers. Inside the archive we find two decode\nPDF files and one SCR file:\n\nMuch to our surprise, the \"SCR\" file turned out to be a backdoor prepared especially for the Naikon\nfraudsters.\n\nThe file \"Directory of ... Mar 31, 2014.scr\" (md5: 198fc1af5cd278091f36645a77c18ffa) drops a blank\ndocument containing the error message and a backdoor module (md5:\n**588f41b1f34b29529bc117346355113f). The backdoor connects to the command server located at**\n**philippinenews[.]mooo[.]com.**\n\nThe backdoor can perform the following actions:\n\n\n-----\n\nupdate itself\nuninstall itself\n\nWe were amazed to see this course of action and decided to investigate the \"Empire Strikes Back\"­door\nfurther; naming the actor \"Hellsing\" (explained later).\n\nThe malware used by the intended victim appears to have the following geographical distribution,\naccording to KSN data:\n\nMalaysia – government networks\nPhilippines – government networks\nIndonesia – government networks\nUSA ­ diplomatic agencies\nIndia (old versions of malware)\n\nIn addition, we've observed the targeting of ASEAN­related entities.\n\n_Victims of Hellsing attacks_\n\nThe actor targets its intended victims using spear­phishing emails with archives containing malware,\nsimilar to the one it used against the Naikon group. Some of the attachment names we observed\ninclude:\n\n2013 Mid­Year IAG Meeting Admin Circular FINAL.7z\nHSG FOLG ITEMS FOR USE OF NEWLY PROMOTED YNC FEDERICO P AMORADA 798085 PN\nCLN.zip\nHome Office Directory as of May 2012.Please find attached here the latest DFA directory and key\nposition officials for your referenece.scr\nLOI N 135 12 2 d Q t S\n\n\n-----\n\nLetter to SND_Office Call and Visit to Commander, United States Pacific Command (USPACOM)\nVER 4.0.zip\nPAF­ACES Fellowship Program.scr\nRAND Analytic Architecture for Capabilities Based Planning, Mission System Analysis, and\nTransformation.scr\nUpdate Attachments_Interaction of Military Personnel with the President _2012_06_28.rar\nUpdate SND Meeting with the President re Hasahasa Shoal Incident.scr\nWashington DC Directory November 2012­EMBASSY OF THE PHILIPPINES.zip\nZPE­791­2012&ZPE­792­2012.rar\nzpe­791­2012.PDF.scr\n\nWe've observed RAR, ZIP and 7ZIP archives in the attacks ­ the 7ZIP archives with passwords were\nprobably introduced as a way to bypass the recent security features on Gmail, which block password­\nprotected archives with executables inside.\n\nEach backdoor has a command and control server inside as well as a version number and a campaign\nor victim identifier.

One of the Hellsing\nsamples we analysed (md5: 0cbefd8cd4b9a36c791d926f84f10b7b) connects to the C&C server at\n**webmm[.]indiadigest[.]in. Although the hostname is not the same, the top level domain suggests some**\nkind of connection between the groups. Several other C&C subdomains on \"indiadigest[.]in\" include:\n\naac.indiadigest[.]in\nld.indiadigest[.]in\nlongc.indiadigest[.]in\n\nAnother overlap we observed is with an APT known as Cycldek or Goblin Panda. Some of the Hellsing\nsamples we analysed in this operation (e.g. md5: a91c9a2b1bc4020514c6c49c5ff84298) communicate\nwith the server webb[.]huntingtomingalls[.]com, using a protocol specific to the Cycldek backdoors\n(binup.asp/textup.asp/online.asp).\n\nIt appears that the Hellsing developer started with the Cycldek sources and worked together with the\noperators from other APT groups. Nevertheless, it is sufficiently different to warrant classification as a\nstand­alone operation.\n\nSo, where does the Hellsing name come from? One of the samples we analysed (md5:\n036e021e1b7f61cddfd294f791de7ea2) appears to have been compiled in a rush and the attacker forgot\nto remove the debug information. One can see the project name is Hellsing and the malware is called\n\"msger\":\n\nOf course, Hellsing can have many different meanings, including the famous doctor from Bram Stoker's\nDracula. However, according to Wikipedia, \"Hellsing (ヘルシング Herushingu) is also a Japanese _mang_\n_a series written and illustrated by_ _Kouta Hirano. It first premiered in_ _Young King Ours in 1997 and ended_\n_in September 2008\"._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Hellsing series chronicles the efforts of the mysterious and secret Hellsing Organization, as it\ncombats vampires, ghouls, and other supernatural foes; which makes it perhaps an appropriate name\nfor our group.\n\nIn addition to the Hellsing/msger malware, we've identified a second generation of Trojan samples which\nappear to be called \"xweber\" by the attackers:\n\n\"Xweber\" seems to be the more recent Trojan, taking into account compilation timestamps. All the\n\"msger\" samples we have seen appear to have been compiled in 2012. The \"Xweber\" samples are from\n2013 and from 2014, indicating that at some point during 2013 the \"msger\" malware project was\nrenamed and/or integrated into \"Xweber\".\n\nDuring our investigation we've observed the Hellsing APT using both the \"Xweber\" and \"msger\"\nbackdoors in their attacks, as well as other tools named \"xrat\", \"clare\", \"irene\" and \"xKat\".\n\n## Other tools\n\nO th H ll i tt k i t th d l th t l hi h b d f\n\n\n-----\n\n**Name** test.exe\n\n**Size** 45,568 bytes\n\n**MD5** 14309b52f5a3df8cb0eb5b6dae9ce4da\n\n**Type** Win32 PE i386 executable\n\nThis tool is used to gather information and test available proxies. Interestingly, it also contains the\nHellsing debug path:\n\nAnother attack tool deployed in a victim's environment was a file system driver, named \"diskfilter.sys\",\nalthough internally it claims to be named \"xrat.sys\". The driver is unsigned and compiled for 32­bit\nWindows. It was used briefly in 2013, before being abandoned by the attackers, possibly due to\nWindows 7 driver signing requirements:\n\nAnother tool used by the attackers is called \"xKat\":\n\n**Name** xkat.exe\n\n**Size** 78,848 bytes\n\n**MD5** 621e4c293313e8638fb8f725c0ae9d0f\n\n**Type** Win32 PE i386 executable\n\nThis is a powerful file deletion and process killer which uses a driver (Dbgv.sys) to perform the\noperations. We've seen it being used by the attackers to kill and delete malware belonging to their\ncompetitors.\n\nSome of the debug paths found in the binaries include:\n\ne:\\Hellsing\\release\\clare.pdb\ne:\\Hellsing\\release\\irene\\irene.pdb\nd:\\hellsing\\sys\\irene\\objchk_win7_x86\\i386\\irene.pdb\nd:\\hellsing\\sys\\xkat\\objchk_win7_x86\\i386\\xKat.pdb\nd:\\Hellsing\\release\\msger\\msger_install.pdb\nd:\\Hellsing\\release\\msger\\msger_server.pdb\nd:\\hellsing\\sys\\xrat\\objchk_win7_x86\\i386\\xrat.pdb\nD:\\Hellsing\\release\\exe\\exe\\test.pdb\n\n\n-----\n\ng, y y y p p\nand allow others to draw their own conclusions.\n\nThe Hellsing­related samples appear to have been compiled around the following times:\n\nAssuming normal work starts at around 9 am, the attacker seems to be most active in a time­zone of\nGMT+8 or +9, considering a work program of 9/10 am to 6/7pm.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe Hellsing APT group is currently active in the APAC region, hitting targets mainly in the South China\nSea area, with a focus on Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia. The group has a relatively small\nfootprint compared to massive operations such as \"Equation\". Smaller groups can have the advantage\nof being able to stay under the radar for longer periods of time, which is what happened here.\n\nThe targeting of the Naikon group by the Hellsing APT is perhaps the most interesting part. In the past,\nwe've seen APT groups accidentally hitting each other while stealing address books from victims and\nthen mass­mailing everyone on each of these lists. But, considering the timing and origin of the attack,\nthe current case seems more likely to be an APT­on­APT attack.\n\nTo protect against a Hellsing attack, we recommend that organisations follow basic security best\npractices:\n\nDon't open attachments from people you don't know\nBeware of password­protected archives which contain SCR or other executable files inside\nIf you are unsure about the attachment, try to open it in a sandbox\nMake sure you have a modern operating system with all patches installed\nUpdate all third party applications such as Microsoft Office, Java, Adobe Flash Player and Adobe\nR d\n\n\n-----\n\n**j** **,** **j** **pp** **g** **j,** **j**\n**Dropper.Win32.Agent.kzqq.**\n\n**Deny the Hellsing APT by default**\n\n## Appendix:\n\nHellsing Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n_Evernote makes it easy to remember things big and small from your everyday life using your computer,_\n\n_tablet, phone and the web._\n\n[Terms of Service](https://evernote.com/tos/) [Privacy Policy](https://evernote.com/privacy/)\n\n\n-----",
