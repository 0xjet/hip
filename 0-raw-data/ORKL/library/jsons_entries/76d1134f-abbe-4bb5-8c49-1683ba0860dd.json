Out-of-the-box PoshC2 comes PowerShell/C# and\nPython2/Python3 implants with payloads written in PowerShell v2 and v4, C++\nand C# source code, a variety of executables, DLLs and raw shellcode in\n\n\n[Docker Image CIDocker Image CI](https://github.com/nettitude/PoshC2/workflows/Docker%20Image%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)\n\n\n-----\n\naddition to a Python2/Python3 payload. These enable C2 functionality on a\nwide range of devices and operating systems, including Windows, *nix and\nOSX.\n\nOther notable features of PoshC2 include:\n\nConsistent and Cross-Platform support using Docker.\nHighly configurable payloads, including default beacon times, jitter, kill\ndates, user agents and more.\nA large number of payloads generated out-of-the-box which are\nfrequently updated.\nShellcode containing in-build AMSI bypass and ETW patching for a high\nsuccess rate and stealth.\nAuto-generated Apache Rewrite rules for use in a C2 proxy, protecting\nyour C2 infrastructure and maintaining good operational security.\nA modular and extensible format allowing users to create or edit C#,\nPowerShell or Python3 modules which can be run in-memory by the\nImplants.\nNotifications on receiving a successful Implant via Pushover or Slack.\nA comprehensive and maintained contextual help and an intelligent\nprompt with contextual auto-completion, history and suggestions.\nFully encrypted communications, protecting the confidentiality and\nintegrity of the C2 traffic even when communicating over HTTP.\nClient/Server format allowing multiple team members to utilise a single\nC2 server.\nExtensive logging. Every action and response is timestamped and stored\nin a database with all relevant information such as user, host, implant\nnumber etc. In addition to this the C2 server output is directly logged to a\nseparate file.\nPowerShell-less implants that do not use\nSystem.Management.Automation.dll using C# or Python2/Python3.\n[A free and open-source SOCKS Proxy using SharpSocks](https://github.com/nettitude/SharpSocks)\nHTTP(S) and SMB named-pipe comms for implants combined with\nImplant Daisy-chaining for reaching networks that do not have access to\nthe internet\n\n## Documentation\n\nWe maintain PoshC2 documentation over at\n[https://poshc2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://poshc2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\nFind us on #Slack - [poshc2.slack.com (to request an invite send an email to](https://github.com/nettitude/PoshC2/blob/master/poshc2.slack.com)\n[labs@nettitude.com)](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:labs@nettitude.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Install\n\nYou can install PoshC2 directly or use the Docker images, instructions for both\nare below.\n\n### Direct install on Kali hosts\n\nAn install script is provided for installing PoshC2:\n```\n*** PoshC2 Install script ***\nUsage:\n./Install.sh -b <git branch> -p <Directory to clone PoshC2 to>\nDefaults are master branch to /opt/PoshC2\n\n```\nElevated privileges are required as the install script performs `apt updates`\nand installations.\n```\ncurl -sSL\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/nettitude/PoshC2/master/Install.sh |\nsudo bash\n\n```\nAlternatively the repository can be cloned down and the install script manually\nrun.\n```\nsudo ./Install.sh\n\n```\nYou can manually set the PoshC2 installation directory by passing it to the\nInstall.sh script as the `-p argument. The default is /opt/PoshC2:`\n```\ncurl -sSL\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/nettitude/PoshC2/master/Install.sh |\nsudo bash -s -- -p /root/PoshC2\n\n### Cutting Edge Features\n\n```\nWe want to keep the `master branch stable to ensure that users are able to`\nrely on it when required and for this reason changes can often be featurecomplete but not yet present on `master as they have not been tested`\ncompletely and signed-off yet.\n\nIf you want to look at upcoming features in PoshC2 you can check out the\n```\ndev branch, or any individual feature branches branched off of dev .\n\n```\nAs features are tested before they are merged into `dev this branch should`\nstill be fairly stable and operators can opt in to using this branch or a particular\nfeature branch for their engagement. This does trade stablity for new features\nhowever so do it at your own discretion.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo use `dev or a feature branch pass the branch name to the Install.sh script`\nas the `-b argument:`\n```\ncurl -sSL\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/nettitude/PoshC2/dev/Install.sh | sudo\nbash -s -- -b dev\n\n```\nNote the URL includes the branch name also (here `dev instead of` `master ).`\n\n## Installing for Docker\n\nYou can also run PoshC2 using Docker, this allows more stable and running\nand enables PoshC2 to easily run on other operating systems.\n\nThe Docker install does not clone PoshC2 as the PoshC2 images on Docker\nHub are used, so only a minimal install of some dependencies and scripts are\nperformed.\n\nTo start with, install Docker on the host and then add the PoshC2 projects\ndirectory to Docker as a shared directory if required for your OS. By default this\nis /var/poshc2 on *nix and /private/var/poshc2 on Mac.\n\n### Kali based hosts\n\nInstall script:\n```\n*** PoshC2 Install script for Docker ***\nUsage:\n./Install-for-Docker.sh -b <git branch>\nDefault is the master branch\n\n```\nElevated privileges are required as the install script performs script\ninstallations.\n```\ncurl -sSL\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/nettitude/PoshC2/master/Install-forDocker.sh | sudo bash\n\n```\nTo use the `dev or feature branches with Docker curl down the` `Install-for-`\n```\nDocker.sh on the appropriate branch and pass the branch name as an\n\n```\nargument:\n```\ncurl -sSL\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/nettitude/PoshC2/BRANCHNAME/Installfor-Docker.sh | sudo bash -s -- -b BRANCHNAME\n\n### Windows\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nOn Windows, import the PoshC2.psm1 PowerShell module.\n```\nImport-Module -DisableNameChecking\nC:\\PoshC2\\resources\\scripts\\PoshC2.psm1\nposh-project -PoshC2Dir \"C:\\PoshC2\" -LocalPoshC2ProjectDir\n\"C:\\PoshC2_Project\" -Arg1 \"-n\" -Arg2 \"newproject\"\nposh-config -PoshC2Dir \"C:\\PoshC2\" -LocalPoshC2ProjectDir\n\"C:\\PoshC2_Project\"\nposh-server -PoshC2Dir \"C:\\PoshC2\" -LocalPoshC2ProjectDir\n\"C:\\PoshC2_Project\"\nposh -PoshC2Dir \"C:\\PoshC2\" -LocalPoshC2ProjectDir \"C:\\PoshC2_Project\"\nusername\n\n## Running PoshC2\n\n```\nCreate a new project:\n```\nposh-project -n <project-name>\n\n```\nProjects can be switched to or listed using this script:\n```\n[*] Usage: posh-project -n <new-project-name>\n[*] Usage: posh-project -s <project-to-switch-to>\n[*] Usage: posh-project -l (lists projects)\n[*] Usage: posh-project -d <project-to-delete>\n[*] Usage: posh-project -c (shows current project)\n\n```\nEdit the configuration for your project:\n```\nposh-config\n\n```\nLaunch the PoshC2 server:\n```\nposh-server\n\n```\nAlternatively start it as a service:\n```\nposh-service\n\n```\nSeparately, run the ImplantHandler for interacting with implants:\n```\nposh -u <username>\n\n```\nSee [https://poshc2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for full documentation on PoshC2.](https://poshc2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n### Specifying a Docker tag\n\nIf you are using Docker you can specify the Docker image tag to run with the `-`\n```\nt option to posh-server and posh .\n\n```\nE.g.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nposh server t latest\n\n## Updating PoshC2 Installations\n\n```\n**It is not recommended to update PoshC2 during an engagement.**\n**Incoming changes may be incompatible with an existing project and can**\n**result in erratic behaviour.**\n\nWhen using a git cloned version of PoshC2 you can update your PoshC2\ninstallation using the following command:\n```\n*** PoshC2 Update Script ***\nUsage:\nposh-update -b <git branch>\nDefault is the master branch\n\n## Using older versions\n\n```\nYou can use an older version of PoshC2 by referencing the appropriate tag.\nNote this only works if you have cloned down the repository. You can list the\ntags for the repository by issuing:\n```\ngit tag --list\n\n```\nIf you have a local clone of PoshC2 you can change the version that is in use\nwhile offline by just checking out the version you want to use:\n```\ngit reset --hard <tag name>\n\n```\nFor example:\n```\ngit reset --hard v4.8\n\n```\nHowever note that this will overwrite any local changes to files, such as\nchanges to the configuration files, and you may have to re-run the install script\nfor that version or re-setup the environment appropriately.\n\n## License / Terms of Use\n\nThis software should only be used for authorised testing activity and not for\nmalicious use.\n\nBy downloading this software you are accepting the terms of use and the\nlicensing agreement.\n\n\n-----",
