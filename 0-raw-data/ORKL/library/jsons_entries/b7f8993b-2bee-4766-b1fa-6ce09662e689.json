Their targets have primarily been defense, energy, and\ngovernment organizations located in South/Southeast Asia, with emphasis on Vietnamese\ntargeting. Within this analysis I review artifacts that exhibit behavior consistent with past\nNewcore RAT samples, which have been attributed to the GoblinPanda APT group.\n\n## Analysis\n\nWhile reviewing suspected dropper files, I came across an interesting document titled “Bao\n_Cao Su Kien Dong Tam.doc”, which translates to “Report the Dong Tam event” in_\nVietnamese. This document was created on 01-10-2020 at 08:31:00, and purported to\ncontain information about a recent controversy regarding land disputes between the\nVietnamese government and the locals of Dong Tam (a rural commune located in Hanoi,\nVietnam). While this is not the first time tensions were high between Dong Tam locals and\nthe Vietnamese government, the timing of the most recent events and the document creation\ndate is quite suspect, with the most recent dispute occurring on 01-09-2020 - the day prior to\nthe document creation.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Shown above: Recent news headlines about Dong Tam village (source)](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51105808)\n\nUpon opening the document, CVE-2017-11882 is silently executed in the background. CVE_2017-11882, which was patched by Microsoft in November of 2017, is a memory corruption_\nvulnerability which grants the attacker RCE (remote code execution) upon the user opening\n[a specially crafted file (see here for the Microsoft advisory).](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11882)\n\n\n-----\n\nShown above: Suspected Goblin Panda APT Lure “Bao Cao Su Kien Dong Tam.doc”\n\nFollowing exploitation, an embedded object “wd32PrvSE.wmf” is dropped to the user’s local\ntemp directory, and subsequently executed. Wd32PrvSE.wmf then drops three files to the\nuser’s local temp directory - QcConsole.exe, QcLite.dll, and stdole.tlb. While QcConsole.exe\nappears to be a valid and signed file belonging to McAfee, Inc. the other two dropped files\n(QcLite.dll and stdole.tlb) have less than benevolent intentions.\n\n_It should be noted that, at the time of this writing, the document, wd32PrvSE.wmf, QcLite.dll,_\n_and stdole.tlb have very low or nonexistent detection rates of only 15/58 (document), 0/56_\n_(WMF), 3/68 (DLL), and 0/56 (TLB) on VirusTotal, respectively._\n\n_QcConsole.exe is then executed, and loads QcLite.dll. QcLite.dll will then establish_\npersistence via an autorun registry key named “Windows HD Audio Manager”, drop a file\ntitled “desktop.ini” to the C:\\ProgramData\\ directory containing obfuscated data, and load the\ncontents of stdole.tlb to memory, and decrypt it, resulting in executable data.\n\n_Dllhst3g.exe, a legitimate Windows binary, is then started in a suspended state, injected with_\nthe executable data extracted from stdole.tlb, and is subsequently resumed. The\ncompromised dllhst3g.exe then decodes the contents of the previously dropped “desktop.ini”\nfile, which directs it to the location of QcConsol.exe, and QcConsol.exe is executed for a\nsecond time.\n\n\n-----\n\nShown above: Execution graph\n\nCommand & Control communications are then initiated via the secondary QcConsol.exe\nprocess to the URLs “hxxp://club[.]baclieuvn[.]com:8080/link?\n_url=maOVmKGmMDU1&enpl=OXco&encd=XARIZTE=” and_\n_“hxxp://club[.]baclieuvn[.]com/link?url=maOVmKGmMDU1&enpl=OXco&encd=XARIZTE=”._\nWhile this domain currently resolves to the Singapore IP Address 103.253.25[.]15, none of\nthe C2 requests received a response. This may be due to the infrastructure being burnt or\nspecific geolocation requirements.\n\n\n-----\n\nShown above: Packet capture of suspected Newcore RAT C2\n\nAlthough I was unable to obtain additional C2 communications, the activity observed in\nrelation to the dropped artifacts is very reminiscent of Newcore Remote Access Trojan.\nFurthermore, the targeted nature of the weaponized document, in addition to the apparent\ntargeting of Vietnamese individuals, is quite suspect. While this isn’t conclusive evidence that\nGoblin Panda is responsible for this sample, the similarities between it and other confirmed\nNewcore RAT samples, in addition to the fact that Vietnam has historically been targeted by\nGoblin Panda, is telling.\n\n## Indicators\n\nIndicator Type Description\n\nclub.baclieuvn.com Domain Newcore RAT\nCommand &\nControl server\n\n\n103.253.25.15 IP\nAddress\n\n\nIP Address\nhosting\nNewcore RAT\nCommand &\nControl server\n“baclieuvn.com”\n\n\n/link?url=maOVmKGmMDU1&enpl=OXco&encd=XARIZTE= URI Newcore RAT\nCommand &\nControl URI\nPattern\n\n\n/link?\nurl=maOVmKGmMDU1&enpl=JWAsBQ==&encd=XARIZTE=\n\n\nURI Newcore RAT\nCommand &\nControl URI\nPattern\n\n\n-----\n\ne9ba8cc1119dc4a972d0d363edcc0101 MD5 Bao cao su kien\nDong Tam.doc suspected\nGoblin Panda\ndropper\n\n42c1a3a74cec2dc4a1c1a7a10d9d14e4 MD5 QcLite.dll\n\n6d1876c07d176185dc61310b9aa510fe MD5 stdole.tlb\n\n7edeb624f2fef843ed26f24f3dd01a3f MD5 wd32PrvSE.wmf\n\n## References/Further Reading\n\n1. https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/cta-security-playbook–goblin-panda.html\n2. https://medium.com/@Sebdraven/goblin-panda-continues-to-target-vietnam\nbc2f0f56dcd6\n3. https://app.any.run/tasks/b64134d1-b809-4ff8-bcb0-91c18425c541/\n4. https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2020/pdf/JSAC2020_8_koike-nakajima_jp.pdf\n5. https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-analysis-of-cve-2017-11882-exploit-in-the\nwild/\n6. https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for\naugust-goblin-panda/\n7. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51105808\n\n\n-----",
