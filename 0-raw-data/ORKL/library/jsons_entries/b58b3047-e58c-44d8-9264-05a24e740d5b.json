During this time it has managed to avoid scrutiny by the security**\n\n**community. The current version of the malware allows the operator to steal files,�**\n\n**keystrokes, perform screenshots, and execute arbitrary code on the infected host. Talos**\n\n**has named this malware KONNI.**\n\n**Throughout the multiple campaigns observed over the last 3 years, the actor has used an**\n\n**email attachment as the initial infection vector. They then use additional social engineering**\n\n**to prompt the target to open a .src file, display a decoy document to the users, and finally�**\n\n**execute the malware on the victim's machine. The malware infrastructure of the analysed**\n\n**samples was hosted by a free web hosting provider: 000webhost. The malware has**\n\n**evolved over time. In this article, we will analyse this evolution:**\n\n**at the beginning the malware was only an information stealer without remote**\n**administration**\n\n**it moved from a single file malware to a dual file malware (an executable and a�**\n**dynamic library)**\n\n**the malware has supported more and more features over the time**\n\n**the decoy documents have become more and more advanced**\n\n**The different versions contain copy/pasted code from previous versions.**\n**Moreover the new version searches for files generated by previous versions.�**\n**(This implies that the malware has been used several times against the same**\n**targets)**\n\n**This evolution is illustrated across 4 campaigns: one in 2014, one in 2016 and finally two in�**\n\n**2017. The decoy document of the 2 last campaigns suggests that the targets are public**\n\n**organisations. Both documents contained email addresses, phone numbers and contacts**\n\n**of members of official organizations such as United Nations, UNICEF, and Embassies�**\n\n**linked to North Korea**\n\n\n-----\n\n**2014 CAMPAIGN: FATAL BEAUTY**\n\n**In this campaign, the dropper filename was beauty.src. Based on the compilation date of�**\n\n**the two binaries, this campaign took place in September 2014. Once executed, two files�**\n\n**were dropped on the targeted system: a decoy document (a picture) and a fake**\n\n**svchost.exe binary. Both files were stored in \"C:\\Windows\". The picture is a Myanmar�**\n\n**temple:**\n\n**The fake svchost binary is the KONNI malware. The first task of the malware is to�**\n\n**generate an ID to identify the infected system. This ID is generated based on the**\n\n**installation date of the system, as found in the registry**\n\n**(HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\InstallDate). The second task of**\n\n**malware is to ping the CC and get orders. The malware includes 2 domains:**\n\n**phpschboy[.]prohosts[.]org**\n\n**jams481[.]site[.]bz**\n\n**The developer used the Microsoft Winsocks API to handle the network connection.**\n\n**Surprisingly, this isn't the easiest or the most efficient technical choice for HTTP�**\n\n**connection. The malware samples we analysed connected to only one URI: <c2-**\n\n**domain>/login php**\n\n\n-----\n\n**This version of KONNI is not designed to execute code on the infected system. The**\n\n**purpose is to be executed only once and steal data on the infected system, here are the**\n\n**main features:**\n\n**Keyloggers**\n\n**Clipboard stealer**\n\n**Firefox profiles and cookies stealer�**\n\n**Chrome profiles and cookies stealer�**\n\n**Opera profiles and cookies stealer�**\n\n**The malware internally uses several temporary files:�**\n\n**spadmgr.ocx**\n\n**screentmp.tmp (log file of the keylogger)�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**2016 CAMPAIGN: \"HOW CAN NORTH KOREAN HYDROGEN BOMB WIPE OUT**\n\n**MANHATTAN.SRC\"**\n\n**The name of the .src file was directly linked to tension between North Korea and USA in�**\n\n**March 2016:** **[more information. Based on the compilation dates of the binaries, the](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/north-korea-claims-it-could-wipe-out-manhattan-with-a-hydrogen-bomb/2016/03/13/3834cd54-e919-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html)**\n\n**campaign took place in the same period. An interesting fact: the dropped library was**\n\n**compiled in 2014 and appears in our telemetry in August 2015. Indicating that this library**\n\n**was probably used in another campaign.**\n\n**The .src file contains 2 Office documents. The first document was in English and a second�**\n\n**in Russian. In the sample only the English version can be displayed to the user (that is**\n\n**hardcoded in the sample):**\n\n**The Russian document is not used by the sample, we assume that the author of the**\n\n**malware forgot to remove the resource containing the Russia decoy document:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The malware author changed the malware architecture, this version is divided in two**\n\n**binaries:**\n\n**conhote.dll**\n\n**winnit.exe**\n\n**Another difference is the directory where the files are dropped, it's no longer C:\\Windows�**\n\n**but rather the local setting of the current user (%USERPROFILE%\\Local**\n\n**Settings\\winnit\\winnit.exe). Thanks to this modification, the malware can be executed with�**\n\n**a non-administrator account. The .dll file is executed by the .exe file. In this version, a�**\n\n**shortcut is created in order to launch winnit.exe in the following path**\n\n**%USERPROFILE%\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\Anti virus service.lnk. As you can see**\n\n**the attacker has went to great lengths to disguise his service as a legitimate Antivirus**\n\n**Service by using the name 'Anti virus service.lnk'. This is of course simple but often it can**\n\n**be enough for a user to miss something malicious by name.**\n\n**As in the previous version, the ID of the infected system is generated with exactly the**\n\n**same method. The C2 is different and the analysed version this time only contains a single**\n\n**domain:**\n\n**dowhelsitjs[.]netau[.]net**\n\n**In this version, the developer used a different API, the Wininet API which make more**\n\n**sense for Web requests. Moreover the C2 infrastructure evolved too, more .php files are�**\n\n**available through the web hosting:**\n\n**<c2-domain>/login.php (for infected machine registration)**\n\n**<c2-domain>/upload.php (for uploading files on the C2)�**\n\n**<c2-domain>/download.php (for downloading file from the C2)�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**This version includes the stealer features mentioned in the previous version and**\n\n**additionally Remote Administration Tool features such as file uploading/download and�**\n\n**arbitrary command execution. The library is only used to perform keylogging and clipboard**\n\n**stealing. Indeed, the malware author moved this part of the code from the core of the**\n\n**malware to a library. An interesting element is that the malware looks for filenames created�**\n\n**with the previous version of KONNI. This implies that the malware targeted the same**\n\n**people as the previous version and they are designed to work together.**\n\n**The malware internally uses the following files:�**\n\n**solhelp.ocx**\n\n**sultry.ocx**\n\n**helpsol.ocx**\n\n**psltre.ocx**\n\n**screentmp.tmp (log file of the keylogger)�**\n\n**spadmgr.ocx**\n\n**apsmgrd.ocx**\n\n**wpg.db**\n\n**2017 CAMPAIGNS**\n\n**P** **Y** **O** **N** **G** **Y** **A** **N** **G** **D** **I** **R** **E** **C** **T** **O**\n\n**R** **C** **_** **O** **F** **F** **I** **C** **E** **_** **C** **O** **O** **R** **D** **I** **N**\n\n**In this campaign, the malware author uses the following name: Pyongyang Directory**\n\n**Group email April 2017 RC_Office_Coordination_Associate.src. The decoy document�**\n\n**shown after infection is an Office document containing email addresses, phone numbers�**\n\n**and contacts of members of official organizations such as the United Nations, UNICEF,�**\n\n**Embassies linked to North Korea.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The .src files drops two files: an executable and a library. As in the previous version, the�**\n\n**persistence is achieved by a Windows shortcut (in this case adobe distillist.lnk). Contrary**\n\n**to the previous version, the developers moved the core of malware to the library. The**\n\n**executable performs the following tasks:**\n\n**If the system is a 64-bit version of Windows, it downloads and executes a**\n**specific 64-bit version of the malware thanks to a powershell script:�**\n\n**Loading the dropped library**\n\n**The library contains the same features as the previous version as well as new ones. This**\n\n**version of KONNI is the most advanced with better coding. The malware configuration�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**A new URI is available:**\n\n**<c2-domain>/uploadtm.php**\n\n**This URI is used with a new feature implemented in this version: the malware is able to**\n\n**perform screenshot (thanks to the GDI API) and uploads it thank to this URL. The malware**\n\n**checks if a file used on a previous version of KONNI is available on the system. Here is�**\n\n**the complete list of files internally used by the RAT:�**\n\n**error.tmp (the log file of the keylogger)�**\n\n**tedsul.ocx**\n\n**helpsol.ocx**\n\n**trepsl.ocx**\n\n**psltred.ocx**\n\n**solhelp.ocx**\n\n**sulted.ocx**\n\n**The handling of instructions has improved too. Here are the 7 actions that the infected**\n\n**machine can be instructed to perform:**\n\n**Delete a specific file;�**\n\n**Upload a specific file based on a filename;�**\n\n**Upload a specific file based on the full path name;�**\n\n**Create a screenshot and uploads it on the C2;**\n\n**Get system information;**\n\n**Download a file from the Internet;�**\n\n**Execute a command;**\n\n**This graph shows the decision tree:**\n\n**When the attacker wants to gather information on the infected system (action 5), it**\n\n**retrieves the following information:**\n\n**Hostname**\n\n**IP address**\n\n**Computer name**\n\n**Username name**\n\n**Connected drive**\n\n**OS version**\n\n**Architecture**\n\n**Start menu programs**\n\n\n-----\n\n**I** **N** **T** **E** **R** **A** **G** **E** **N** **C** **Y** **L** **I** **S** **T**\n\n**R** **C** **_** **O** **F** **F** **I** **C** **E** **_** **C** **O** **O** **R** **D** **I** **N**\n\n**The last identified campaign where KONNI was used was named Inter Agency List and�**\n\n**Phonebook - April 2017 RC_Office_Coordination_Associate.src. This file drops exactly the�**\n\n**same files than the previous campaign but the decoy document is different:�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**This document contains the name, phone number and email address of members of**\n\n**agencies, embassies and organizations linked to North Korea.**\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**The analysis shows us the evolution of KONNI over the last 3 years. The last campaign**\n\n**was started a few days ago and is still active. The infrastructure remains up and running at**\n\n**the time of this post. The RAT has remained under the radar for multiple years. An**\n\n**explanation could be the fact that the campaign was very limited nature, which does not**\n\n**arouse suspicion.**\n\n**This investigation shows that the author has evolved technically (by implementing new**\n\n**features) and in the quality of the decoy documents. The campaign of April 2017 used**\n\n**pertinent documents containing potentially sensitive data.
