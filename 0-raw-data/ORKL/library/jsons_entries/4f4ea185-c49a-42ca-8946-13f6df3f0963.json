Widely discussed in the**\n\n**[media, the attacks took advantage of known BlackEnergy Trojans as well as several new modules.](https://securelist.com/blog/research/67353/be2-custom-plugins-router-abuse-and-target-profiles/)**\n\n**BlackEnergy is a Trojan that was created by a hacker known as Cr4sh. In 2007, he reportedly stopped**\n\n**[working on it and sold the source code for an estimated $700. The source code appears to have been](http://archive.is/RFBU)**\n\n**picked by one or more threat actors and was used to conduct DDoS attacks against Georgia in 2008.**\n\n**[These unknown actors continued launching DDoS attacks over the next few years. Around 2014, a](https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/36309/black-ddos/)**\n\n**specific user group of BlackEnergy attackers came to our attention when they began deploying**\n\n**SCADA-related plugins to victims in the ICS and energy sectors around the world. This indicated a**\n\n**unique skillset well above the average DDoS botnet master**\n\n\n-----\n\n**One of the prefered targets of the BlackEnergy APT has always been Ukraine. Since the middle of**\n\n**2015, one of the preferred attack vectors for BlackEnergy in Ukraine has been Excel documents with**\n\n**macros that drop the Trojan to disk if the user chooses to run the script in the document.**\n\n**A few days ago, we discovered a new document that appears to be part of the ongoing BlackEnergy**\n\n**APT group attacks against Ukraine. Unlike previous Office files used in previous attacks, this is not an**\n\n**Excel workbook, but a Microsoft Word document. The lure used a document mentioning the Ukraine**\n\n**“Right Sector” party and appears to have been used against a television channel.**\n\n**At the end of the last year, a wave of attacks hit several critical sectors in Ukraine. Widely discussed in**\n\n**the media and by our colleagues from ESET, iSIGHT Partners and other companies, the attacks took**\n\n**advantage of both known BlackEnergy Trojans as well as several new modules. A very good analysis**\n\n**and overview of the BlackEnergy attacks in Ukraine throughout 2014 and 2015 was published by the**\n\n**Ukrainian security firm Cys Centrum (the text is only available in Russian for now, but can be read via**\n\n**_Google Translate)._**\n\n**In the past, we have written about BlackEnergy, focusing on their destructive payloads, Siemens**\n\n**equipment exploitation and router attack plugins. You can read blogs published by my GReAT**\n\n**[colleagues Kurt Baumgartner and Maria Garnaeva here and here. We also published about the](https://securelist.com/blog/research/68838/be2-extraordinary-plugins-siemens-targeting-dev-fails/)**\n\n**[BlackEnergy DDoS attacks.](https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/36309/black-ddos/)**\n\n**Since mid-2015, one of the preferred attack vectors for BlackEnergy in Ukraine has been Excel**\n\n**documents with macros which drop the trojan to disk if the user chooses to run the script in the**\n\n**document.**\n\n**For the historians out there, Office documents with macros were a huge problem in the early 2000s,**\n\n**when Word and Excel supported Autorun macros. That meant that a virus or trojan could run upon the**\n\n**loading of the document and automatically infect a system. Microsoft later disabled this feature and**\n\n**current Office versions need the user to specifically enable the Macros in the document to run them. To**\n\n**get past this inconvenience, modern day attackers commonly rely on social engineering, asking the**\n\n**user to enable the macros in order to view “enhanced content”.**\n\n**Few days ago, we came by a new document that appears to be part of the ongoing attacks**\n\n**BlackEnergy against Ukraine. Unlike previous Office files used in the recent attacks, this is not an Excel**\n\n**workbook, but a Microsoft Word document:**\n\n**“$RR143TB.doc” (md5: e15b36c2e394d599a8ab352159089dd2)**\n\n**This document was uploaded to a multiscanner service from Ukraine on Jan 20 2016, with relatively low**\n\n**detection. It has a creation_datetime and last_saved field of 2015-07-27 10:21:00. This means the**\n\n\n-----\n\n**to view the document.**\n\n**[Interestingly, the document lure mentions “Pravii Sektor” (the Right Sector), a nationalist party in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Sector)**\n\n**Ukraine. The party was formed in November 2013 and has since played an active role in the country’s**\n\n**political scene.**\n\n**To extract the macros from the document without using Word, or running them, we can use a publicly**\n\n**available tool such as oledump by Didier Stevens. Here’s a brief cut and paste:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**As we can see, the macro builds a string in memory that contains a file that is created and written as**\n\n**“vba_macro.exe”.**\n\n**The file is then promptly executed using the Shell command.**\n\n**The vba_macro.exe payload (md5: ac2d7f21c826ce0c449481f79138aebd) is a typical BlackEnergy**\n\n**dropper. It drops the final payload as “%LOCALAPPDATA%\\FONTCACHE.DAT”, which is a DLL file. It**\n\n**then proceeds to run it, using rundll32:**\n\n**rundll32.exe “%LOCALAPPDATA%\\FONTCACHE.DAT”,#1**\n\n**To ensure execution on every system startup, the dropper creates a LNK file into the system startup**\n\n**folder, which executes the same command as above on every system boot.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The final payload (FONTCACHE.DAT, md5: 3fa9130c9ec44e36e52142f3688313ff) is a minimalistic**\n\n**BlackEnergy (v3) trojan that proceeds to connect to its hardcoded C&C server, 5.149.254.114, on Port**\n\n**[80. The server was previously mentioned by our colleagues from ESET in their analysis earlier this](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/03/blackenergy-sshbeardoor-details-2015-attacks-ukrainian-news-media-electric-industry/)**\n\n**month. The server is currently offline, or limits the connections by IP address. If the server is online, the**\n\n**malware issues as HTTP POST request to it, sending basic victim info and requesting commands.**\n\n**The request is BASE64 encoded. Some of the fields contain:**\n\n**b_id=BRBRB-…**\n\n**b_gen=301018stb**\n\n**b_ver=2.3**\n\n**os_v=2600**\n\n**os_type=0**\n\n**The b_id contains a build id and an unique machine identifier and is computed from system information,**\n\n**which makes it unique per victim. This allows the attackers to distinguish between different infected**\n\n**machines in the same network. The field b_gen seems to refer to the victim ID, which in this case is**\n\n**[301018stb. STB could refer to the Ukrainian TV station “STB”, http://www.stb.ua/ru/. This TV station](http://www.stb.ua/ru/)**\n\n**has been publicly mentioned as a victim of the BlackEnergy Wiper attacks in October 2015.**\n\n**BlackEnergy is a highly dynamic threat actor and the current attacks in Ukraine indicate that destructive**\n\n**actions are on their main agenda, in addition to compromising industrial control installations and**\n\n**espionage activities.**\n\n**Our targeting analysis indicates the following sectors have been actively targeted in recent years. If**\n\n**your organization falls into these categories, then you should take BlackEnergy into account when**\n\n**designing your defences:**\n\n**ICS, Energy, government and media in Ukraine**\n\n**ICS/SCADA companies worldwide**\n\n**Energy companies worldwide**\n\n\n-----\n\n**old versions were crude and full of bugs. In the recent attacks, the developers appear to have gotten rid**\n\n**of the unsigned driver which they relied upon to wipe disks at low level and replaced it with more high**\n\n**level wiping capabilities that focus on file extensions as opposed on disks. This is no less destructive**\n\n**than the disk payloads, of course, and has the advantage of not requiring administrative privileges as**\n\n**well as working without problems on modern 64-bit systems.**\n\n**Interestingly, the use of Word documents (instead of Excel) was also mentioned by ICS-CERT, in their**\n\n**[alert 14-281-01B.](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-14-281-01B)**\n\n**It is particularly important to remember that all types of Office documents can contain macros, not just**\n\n**Excel files. This also includes Word, as shown here and alerted by ICS-CERT and PowerPoint, as**\n\n**previously mentioned by Cys Centrum.**\n\n**In terms of the use of Word documents with macros in APT attacks, we recently observed the Turla**\n\n**group relying on Word documents with macros to drop malicious payloads (Kaspersky Private report**\n\n**_available). This leads us to believe that many of these attacks are successful and their popularity will_**\n\n**increase.**\n\n**We will continue to monitor the BlackEnergy attacks in Ukraine and update our readers with more data**\n\n**when available.**\n\n**More information about BlackEnergy APT and extended IOCs are available to** **customers of Kaspersky**\n\n**[Intelligence Services.
