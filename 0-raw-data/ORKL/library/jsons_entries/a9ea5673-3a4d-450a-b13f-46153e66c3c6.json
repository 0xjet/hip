We have a long-standing\n[policy to send you a warning if we detect that your account is a target of government-backed](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/08/a-reminder-about-government-backed.html)\nphishing or malware attempts. So far in 2021, we’ve sent over 50,000 warnings, a nearly\n33% increase from this time in 2020. This spike is largely due to blocking an unusually large\ncampaign from a Russian actor known as APT28 or Fancy Bear.\n\nWe intentionally send these warnings in batches to all users who may be at risk, rather than\nat the moment we detect the threat itself, so that attackers cannot track our defense\nstrategies. On any given day, TAG is tracking more than 270 targeted or government-backed\nattacker groups from more than 50 countries. This means that there is typically more than\none threat actor behind the warnings.\n\nIn this blog, we explore some of the most notable campaigns we’ve disrupted this year from\na different government-backed attacker: APT35, an Iranian group, which regularly conducts\nphishing campaigns targeting high risk users. This is the one of the groups we disrupted\nduring the 2020 US election cycle for its targeting of campaign staffers. For years, this group\nhas hijacked accounts, deployed malware, and used novel techniques to conduct espionage\naligned with the interests of the Iranian government.\n\n## Hijacked websites used for credential phishing attacks\n\n\n-----\n\nIn early 2021, APT35 compromised a website affiliated with a UK university to host a\nphishing kit. Attackers sent email messages with links to this website to harvest credentials\nfor platforms such as Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo. Users were instructed to activate an\ninvitation to a (fake) webinar by logging in. The phishing kit will also ask for second-factor\nauthentication codes sent to devices.\n\nAPT35 has relied on this technique since 2017 — targeting high-value accounts in\ngovernment, academia, journalism, NGOs, foreign policy, and national security. Credential\nphishing through a compromised website demonstrates these attackers will go to great\nlengths to appear legitimate – as they know it's difficult for users to detect this kind of attack.\n\nPhishing page hosted on a compromised website\n\n## Utilization of Spyware Apps\n\n\n-----\n\nIn May 2020, we discovered that APT35 attempted to upload spyware to the Google Play\nStore. [The app was disguised as VPN software that, if installed, could steal sensitive](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/5d3ff202f20af915863eee45916412a271bae1ea3a0e20988309c16723ce4da5)\ninformation such as call logs, text messages, contacts, and location data from devices.\nGoogle detected the app quickly and removed it from the Play Store before any users had a\nchance to install it. Although Play Store users were protected, we are highlighting the app\nhere as TAG has seen APT35 attempt to distribute this spyware on other platforms as\nrecently as July 2021.\n\nSpyware app disguised as a VPN utility\n\n## Conference-themed phishing emails\n\nOne of the most notable characteristics of APT35 is their impersonation of conference\nofficials to conduct phishing attacks. Attackers used the Munich Security and the Think-20\n(T20) Italy conferences as lures in non-malicious first contact email messages to get users to\nrespond. When they did, attackers sent them phishing links in follow-on correspondence.\n\nTargets typically had to navigate through at least one redirect before landing on a phishing\ndomain. Link shorteners and click trackers are heavily used for this purpose, and are\noftentimes embedded within PDF files. We’ve disrupted attacks using Google Drive, App\n\n\n-----\n\nScripts, and Sites pages in these campaigns as APT35 tries to get around our defenses.\nServices from Dropbox and Microsoft are also abused.\n\nGoogle Sites page disguised as a Google Form to redirect to a phishing site\n\n## Telegram for threat actor notifications\n\nOne of APT35’s novel techniques involves using Telegram for operator notifications. The\nattackers embed javascript into phishing pages that notify them when the page has been\n[loaded. To send the notification, they use the Telegram API sendMessage function, which](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendmessage)\nlets anyone use a Telegram bot to send a message to a public channel. The attackers use\nthis function to relay device-based data to the channel, so they can see details such as the\nIP, useragent, and locales of visitors to their phishing sites in real-time. We reported the bot\nto Telegram and they have taken action to remove it.\n\n\n-----\n\nPublic Telegram channel used for attacker notifications\n\n## How we keep users safe from these threats\n\nWe warn users when we suspect a government-backed threat like APT35 is targeting them.\nThousands of these warnings are sent every month, even in cases where the corresponding\nattack is blocked. If you receive a warning it does not mean your account has been\ncompromised, it means you have been identified as a target.\n\n[Workspace administrators are also notified regarding targeted accounts in their domain.](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2018/08/control-government-backed-attack-alerts.html)\nUsers are encouraged to take these warnings seriously and consider enrolling in the\n[Advanced Protection Program or](https://g.co/advancedprotection) [enabling two-factor authentication if they haven't already.](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839)\n\n[We also block malicious domains using Google Safe Browsing – a service that Google's](https://safebrowsing.google.com/)\nsecurity team built to identify unsafe websites across the web and notify users and website\nowners of potential harm. When a user of a Safe Browsing-enabled browser or app attempts\n\n\n-----\n\nto access unsafe content on the web, they ll see a warning page explaining that the content\nthey’re trying to access may be harmful. When a site identified by Safe Browsing as harmful\nappears in Google Search results, we show a warning next to it in the results.\n\nThreat Analysis Group will continue to identify bad actors and share relevant information with\nothers in the industry, with the goal of bringing awareness to these issues, protecting you\nand fighting bad actors to prevent future attacks.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**Indicators from APT28 phishing campaign:**\n\nservice-reset-password-moderate-digital.rf[.]gd\n\nreset-service-identity-mail.42web[.]io\n\ndigital-email-software.great-site[.]net\n\n**Indicators from APT35 campaigns:**\n\n**Abused Google Properties:**\n\nhttps://sites.google[.]com/view/ty85yt8tg8-download-rtih4ithr/\n\nhttps://sites.google[.]com/view/user-id-568245/\n\nhttps://sites.google[.]com/view/hhbejfdwdhwuhscbsb-xscvhdvbc/\n\n**Abused Dropbox Properties:**\n\nhttps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/68y4vpfu8pc3imf/Iraq&Jewish.pdf\n\n**Phishing Domains:**\n\nnco2[.]live\n\nsummit-files[.]com\n\nfiletransfer[.]club\n\ncontinuetogo[.]me\n\naccessverification[.]online\n\ncustomers-verification-identifier[.]site\n\nservice-activity-session[.]online\n\n\n-----\n\nidentifier-service-review[.]site\n\nrecovery-activity-identification[.]site\n\nreview-session-confirmation[.]site\n\nrecovery-service-activity[.]site\n\nverify-service-activity[.]site\n\nservice-manager-notifications[.]info\n\n**Android App:**\n\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/5d3ff202f20af915863eee45916412a271bae1ea3a0e20988\n309c16723ce4da5/detection\n\n**Android App C2:**\n\ncommunication-shield[.]site\n\ncdsa[.]xyz\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n[Threat Analysis Group](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/%20)\n\n\n-----",
