JPCERT/CC has\nconfirmed that a group called APT10 used this tool in some targeted attacks against\nJapanese organisations.\n\nAs Quasar’s source code is publicly available, there are many variants of this RAT seen in\nthe wild (referred to as “Quasar Family” hereafter). Some of them have been used in attacks\nagainst Japanese organisations, and they are seen as a threat as well as Quasar itself.\n\nThis article introduces the details of Quasar and Quasar Family.\n\n### Quasar overview\n\nQuasar offers many functions which are intended for purposes such as device management,\nsupport operation and employee monitoring. Figure 1 describes Quasar’s functions and its\nsupported environment as specified on GitHub.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Quasar’s functions and supported environment\nThis tool was called “xRAT” at the time of its initial release, however, it was renamed as\n“Quasar” in August 2015. The latest version is v1.4, released in June 2020.\n\nFigure 2: Quasar versions\nAs v1.3 and the earlier are still used in recent attacks, this article explains the functions of\nboth v1.3 and v1.4.\n\n**Communication protocol**\n\nQuasar v1.3 uses its custom protocol which combines AES and QuickLZ. In v1.4, however,\nProtocol Buffer (developed by Google) is used for data serialisation instead. In addition, the\nentire communication is encrypted with TLS1.2.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 shows the comparison of the communication format in v1.3 and v1.4.\n\nFigure 3: Quasar’s communication format\n\n**Communication flow**\n\nIn v1.3, once a client connects to a server, authentication is performed. After that, the main\nbody of data including the commands are exchanged. On the other hand, the authentication\nis replaced by a TLS handshake in v1.4, and the data exchange begins after that.\n\nFigure 4 illustrates Quasar’s communication flow between a client and a server.\n\nFigure 4: Quasar’s communication flow\n\n**Configuration**\n\n\n-----\n\nQuasar possesses its configuration in itself. It is encrypted by the combination of AES and\nBASE64 encoding. It is decrypted with the value specified in “ENCRYPTIONKEY” in the\nconfiguration when executed.\n\nFigure 5: Quasar configuration\n\nFigure 6: Configuration format\nTable 1 details the configuration for Quasar.\n\nTable 1: Configuration\n\nVERSION INSTALL LOGDIRECTORY (1.3)\n\nHOSTS STARTUP SERVERSIGNATURE (1.4)\n\nPORT (xRAT only) MUTEX SERVERCERTIFICATESTR\n(1.4)\n\nRECONNECTDELY STARTUPKEY SERVERCERTIFICATE (1.4)\n\nKEY HIDEFILE HIDELOGDIRECTORY (1.3)\n\n\nAUTHKEY ENABLEUACESCALATION (xRAT\nonly)\n\n\nHIDELOGSUBDIRECTORY\n(1.3)\n\n\nDIRECTORY ENABLELOGGER INSTALLPATH (1.4)\n\nSUBDIRECTORY ENCRYPTIONKEY LOGSPATH (1.4)\n\n\n-----\n\nINSTALLNAME TAG (1.3) UNATTENDEDMODE (1.4)\n\n**Commands**\n\nIn v1.3, command sets are defined for “typeof” calls. Figure 7 shows some examples of\ncommands defined in Quasar.\n\nFigure 7: Commands\n\n### Quasar Family\n\nTable 2 is the list of Quasar Family derived from Quasar which JPCERT/CC confirmed.\n\nTable 2: Quasar Family\n\n\n**Use in attacks in**\n**the wild**\n\n\n**Name** **Category** **Configuration**\n\n\n**Communication**\n**protocol**\n\n\nGolden\nEdition\n\n\nClone Identical Identical Confirmed\n\n\nXPCTRA Clone Custom Identical Confirmed\n\nCinaRAT [2] Clone Identical Identical Confirmed\n\n\n-----\n\n**Use in attacks in**\n**the wild**\n\n\n**Name** **Category** **Configuration**\n\n\n**Communication**\n**protocol**\n\n\nXtremis 2.0\n\n[3]\n\nQuasarStrike\n\n[4]\n\n\nClone Identical Identical Not confirmed\n\nClone Identical Identical Not confirmed\n\n\nVenomRAT Clone Identical Identical Not confirmed\n\n\nRSMaster [5] Partially\ncopied\n\nVoid-RAT Partially\ncopied\n\n\nAsyncRAT\n\n[6]\n\n\nPartially\ncopied\n\n\nCustom Identical Not confirmed\n\nCustom Identical Confirmed\n\nCustom Identical Confirmed\n\n\n\n- “Clone” in the category refers to variants which uses the entire source code of Quasar with\nsome functions added or modified. “Partially copied” refers to variants created as a new RAT\nusing parts of the original source code.\n\nFigure 8 shows the comparison of commands embedded in XPCTRA and Quasar.\n\nFigure 8: Comparison of commands\n\n(Left: XPCTRA / Right: Quasar)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the comparison above, it is clear that commands in XPCTRA are mostly identical to those\nin Quasar.\nFigure 9 shows the comparison of the salt value in AsyncRAT and Quasar.\n\nFigure 9: Comparison of salt value\n\n(Above: AsyncRAT / Below: Quasar)\nThe salt value in AsyncRAT is identical to that in Quasar.\n\nAs Quasar Family applies some parts of the source code of Quasar, its configuration and\ncommunication protocol are also identical. In some cases, some functions are customised,\nand as a result, some new configuration and commands are added.\n\n### Attack campaigns using Quasar\n\nQuasar has been used in many attack campaigns. Table 3 lists the differences of Quasar\nused by each attack group.\n\nTable 3: Example of Quasar used by attack group\n\n**Attack group** **Quasar version** **Customisation** **Obfuscation**\n\nAPT33 1.3.0.0 No ConfuserEx v1.0.0\n\nGorgon Group - No\n\nAPT-C-09 2.0.0.0 RELEASE3 No\n\n\n-----\n\n**Attack group** **Quasar version** **Customisation** **Obfuscation**\n\nDustySky 1.1.0.0 No\n\nAPT10 2.0.0.0(Custom Version) Yes ConfuserEx v1.0.0\n\nThe original Quasar with the default configuration value was used in most cases. Figure 10\nshows an example configuration of Quasar used by APT 33.\n\nFigure 10: Configuration of Quasar used by APT33\nIn most parts, the default values of the builder generating Quasar are used as is, except for\nSTARTUPKEY. This way, attacker groups use the default values as per the original to avoid\nleaving any distinctive evidence.\n\nIn some cases, attackers customise Quasar. For example, APT 10 updated some features\nand used it in some attacks. The following sections will cover the details of this custom\nQuasar.\n\n**Configuration**\n\nQuasar used by APT 10 (hereafter “custom Quasar”) has the following additional values in\nthe configuration.\n\nDOWNLOAD_URL\nPROXY\n\nFigure 11 shows the comparison of configuration in the custom Quasar and the original\nQuasar.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: Comparison of configuration\n\n(Left: custom Quasar / Right: original Quasar)\nIn “PROXY”, a proxy server URL can be configured. This ensures that the custom Quasar is\nable to communicate with a C2 server even if the target’s environment uses proxy servers.\n\nWhile the original Quasar uses CBC mode when encrypting configuration with AES, the\ncustom Quasar uses CFB mode.\n\nFigure 12: Comparison of AES code\n(Left: custom Quasar / Right: original Quasar)\n\n**Added/deleted commands**\n\nThere are some changes to the commands in the custom Quasar. Figure 13 shows the\ncomparison of commands in the custom Quasar and the original Quasar.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13: Comparison of commands\n\n(Left: custom Quasar / Right: original Quasar)\nIn the custom Quasar, new commands DoPlugin and DoPluginResponse are added while\nsome including keylogger are deleted.\n\nWith DoPlugin, new functions can be added by loading additional plugin modules. These\nnew modules can be deleted with DoPluginResponse.\n\nThis change enables Quasar to dynamically extend its functions with commands while\nmaintaining Quasar itself as simple as it can be. This suggests the attacker’s intention to\navoid detection by anti-virus software.\n\n**Error log creation**\n\nThe custom Quasar has a function to create error logs. The file path of the error logs is\nhardcoded in itself.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14: Error log creation\n\n**Communication protocol**\n\nThe encryption algorithms for communication with a C2 server also differs in the custom\nQuasar. While the original Quasar uses AES and QuickLZ, the custom Quasar also uses\nXOR encoding. Figure 15 shows the XOR encoding process added to the custom Quasar.\n\nFigure 15: XOR encoding process\nFor AES encryption, the custom Quasar uses CFB mode instead of CBC mode, as seen in\nthe configuration. The encryption methods are as follows:\n\nOriginal Quasar: QuickLZ + AES (mode CBC)\nCustom Quasar: QuickLZ + AES (mode CFB) + XOR\n\n### C2 server activities\n\nJPCERT/CC investigated the activities of Quasar Family C2 servers based on the\ncharacteristics discussed above. As of November 2020, 76 IP addresses running as C2\nservers have been identified. Figure 16 shows the distribution of Quasar Family C2 servers\nwhich were revealed in this investigation.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16: C2 server distribution\nMultiple C2 servers are still running in different countries, which indicates its activeness.\n\n## In closing\n\nBesides Quasar, other open source RATs are being used in ongoing attack cases [7].\nAttackers are taking advantage of these tools to make attribution difficult and reduce the cost\nfor developing attack infrastructure. It is estimated that this attack trends may continue.\n\n[A tool to support Quasar analysis (compatible with Quasar v1.3 only) is available on GitHub.](https://github.com/JPCERTCC/QuasarRAT-Analysis)\nWe hope you find it useful.\n\nKota Kino, Shusei Tomonaga\nIn cooperation with Tomoaki Tani\n\n(Translated by Yukako Uchida)\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] GitHub: Quasar\n\n[https://github.com/quasar/Quasar](https://github.com/quasar/Quasar)\n\n[2] GitHub: CinaRAT\n\n[https://github.com/wearelegal/CinaRAT](https://github.com/wearelegal/CinaRAT)\n\n[3] GitHub: Xtremis 2.0\n\n[https://github.com/pavitra14/Xtremis-V2.0](https://github.com/pavitra14/Xtremis-V2.0)\n\n[4] GitHub: QuasarStrike\n\n[https://github.com/Q-Strike/QuasarStrike](https://github.com/Q-Strike/QuasarStrike)\n\n[5] GitHub: RSMaster\n\n[https://github.com/Netskyes/rsmaster](https://github.com/Netskyes/rsmaster)\n\n[6] GitHub: AsyncRAT\n\n[https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT/AsyncRAT-C-Sharp](https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT/AsyncRAT-C-Sharp)\n\n\n-----\n\n[7] Japan Security Analyst Conference 2020 (Opening Talk): Looking back on the incidents in\n2019\n[https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2020/pdf/JSAC2020_0_JPCERT_en.pdf](https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2020/pdf/JSAC2020_0_JPCERT_en.pdf)\n\n[Email](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:?subject=Attack%20Activities%20by%20Quasar%20Family&body=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.jpcert.or.jp%2Fen%2F2020%2F12%2Fquasar-family.html)\n\nAuthor\n\n喜野 [孝太(Kota Kino)](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/kino/)\n\nKota Kino is Malware/Forensic Analyst at Incident Response Group, JPCERT/CC since\nAugust 2019.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\n0 people found this content helpful.\n\nIf you wish to make comments or ask questions, please use this form.\n\nThis form is for comments and inquiries.
