The attackers state that they stole\nunencrypted files as part of the attack.\n\nBarnes & Noble is the largest brick-and-mortar bookseller in the United States, with over\n600 bookstores in fifty states. The bookseller also operated the Nook Digital, which is their\neBook and e-Reader platform.\n\n## Ransomware attack leads to an outage\n\nOn October 10th, users began complaining on Nook's Facebook page and Twitter that they\ncould no longer access their library of purchased eBooks and magazine subscriptions.\n\nIn response to the concerns, Barnes & Noble posted an update on the Nook Facebook\npage stating that they are experiencing a severe system failure and are working to get\nsystems operational again.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Late Wednesday night, Barnes & Noble disclosed that they suffered a cyberattack on](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/barnes-and-noble-hit-by-cyberattack-that-exposed-customer-data/)\nOctober 10th, 2020.\n\nAs part of this attack, ransomware attackers actors gained access to corporate network for\nthe company. After discovering the attack, Barnes and Noble shut down their network to\nprevent the attack's further spread, which led to a service outage.\n\n\"It is with the greatest regret we inform you that we were made aware on October 10, 2020\nthat Barnes & Noble had been the victim of a cybersecurity attack, which resulted in\nunauthorized and unlawful access to certain Barnes & Noble corporate systems.\"\n\n\"We write now out of the greatest caution to let you know how this may have exposed some\nof the information we hold of your personal details,\" Barnes & Noble stated in their email.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Barnes & Noble email**\n\n**notification**\nBarnes & Noble states that no payment details have been exposed but are unsure at this\ntime if the hackers accessed other personal information.\n\nThey do admit that email addresses, billing addresses, shipping addresses, and purchase\nhistory were exposed on the hacked systems.\n\nIn response to our queries about the attack, Barnes & Noble shared the following\nstatement.\n\n\"As the letter to our customers explains, we closed down all our networks immediately once\na cybersecurity attack was suspected. We engaged then a firm of cybersecurity consultants\nto evaluate the nature of the threat. With their guidance, we have cautiously restored our\nnetworks which by its nature has taken time. We acted as quickly as we could given the\ncircumstances and notified customers once we were able to give credible information of\nwhat happened. No credit card details are stored on Barnes & Noble systems and therefore\n\n\n-----\n\nthe speculation that financial loss from fraudulent activity could result is inaccurate. As of\nwriting, the cybersecurity consultants have detected no evidence of data having been\nexposed. We have acted therefore with an abundance of caution. We regret sincerely that\nin so acting we have caused disruption to our customers, especially those of NOOK.\"\n\n## Egregor claims to have stolen Barnes & Noble data\n\nAfter publishing our report on the Barnes & Noble cyberattack, BleepingComputer was\ncontacted by a threat actor who stated that the Egregor ransomware operation was behind\nthe attack.\n\nEgregor is a relatively new but active ransomware gang that began operating in the middle\nof September 2020.\n\nBleepingComputer was told that Barnes & Noble's corporate network was compromised by\nthreat actors who stole unencrypted \"financial and audit\" data from their systems.\n\nAfter the hacker gained access to a Windows domain administrator account, another threat\nactor was given access to the network on October 10th, 2020, who then encrypted the\nnetwork's devices.\n\nToday, the Egregor ransomware operation confirmed the threat actor's statements and\npublished files that they claim were stolen during the attack on Barnes & Noble.\n\n**Barnes & Noble data leak on Egregor site**\n\n\n-----\n\nStrangely, instead of leaking stolen files, the leaked data contains two Windows Registry\nhives that appear to have been exported from Barnes & Noble's Windows servers during\nthe attack.\n\n**Leaked Registry hive**\nWhile this corroborates that Egregor was involved in the attack, it does not necessarily\nprove that Egregor stole any financial documents or other files.\n\nBleepingComputer has reached out again to Barnes & Noble with questions regarding this\ndevelopment.\n\n[Egregor also recently attacked game developers Crytek and Ubisoft, whose stolen data was](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/crytek-hit-by-egregor-ransomware-ubisoft-data-leaked/)\nalso leaked online.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Barnes & Noble](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/barnes-and-noble/)\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[Data Exfiltration](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-exfiltration/)\n[Egregor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/egregor/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[NOOK](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/nook/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Registry](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/registry/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
