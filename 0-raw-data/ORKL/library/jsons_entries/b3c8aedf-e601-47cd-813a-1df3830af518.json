One of the most\ndamaging activities an actor pursues is the theft of authentication information, whether it\napplies to business or personal accounts. Unless specifically mitigated, this theft often allows\nan unauthorized actor to masquerade as the victim, either achieving immediate gains or\ncreating a platform from which progressive attack campaigns may launch.\n\nThere are a number of threats that endanger the critical secrecy of credentials, including\npoor operational security practices, social engineering, man-in-the-middle attacks, password\nhash dumping and cracking, and surveillance malware. In this post, Unit 42 examines\nvarious trends in a malware threat set within the surveillance malware category: Predator\nPain and its latest derivative, HawkEye.\n\n## Threat Background\n\nSurveillance malware covers a broad range of capabilities, including:\n\nCapture of keyboard and / or input device (e.g., mouse) activity, with window / process\nawareness (keylogging)\nTaking asset display screen shots or video (display capturing)\nAssuming control of cameras and / or microphones attached to an asset (live\nsurveillance)\nInterception of network communications (sniffing)\n\nEach of these capabilities can be qualified by its scope (i.e., types of information collected)\nand method (ranging in techniques and sophistication). Additionally, some surveillance\nsoftware includes its own exfiltration mechanism, while others may depend on external\nsoftware to accomplish the transfer of captured information.\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth Predator Pain and HawkEye are considered keyloggers, but they also include\nadditional features, such as web browser and e-mail client credential dumping, display\n**capture, and captured information exfiltration. HawkEye is openly sold on a commercial**\nwebsite, whereas Predator Pain is usually acquired through underground forums. Associated\nfeatures have made this set of malware popular with malicious actors across a number of\nmotivations; however, the most prevalent motivation remains cyber crime, in which stolen\ninformation is directly exploited or sold for financial gain. (A list of additional reading links is\nfound at the end of this blog post for anyone interested in learning more about this specific\nthreat set.)\n\n## Trending and Analysis: July 2015-September 2015\n\nThe following sections describe Predator Pain and HawkEye trending and analysis\nconducted by Unit 42 from July 2015 through September 2015. We leveraged the Palo Alto\n[Networks AutoFocus service, under which this threat set is tagged as PredatorPain.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/platforms/subscriptions/autofocus.html)\n\n### Target Selection\n\nAlmost all of the adversaries Unit 42 observed employing this malware threat set harvest\npublicly disclosed or leaked e-mail addresses to construct phishing campaign targeting lists.\nThese lists are mostly indiscriminant, with malicious actors seeking any opportunistic gains\nthey can glean from “shotgun” style attack campaigns. The natural exposure of businesses\nwith publicly advertised e-mail addresses (e.g., sales@<domain> or info@<domain>) makes\nfor easy targeting of what typically represents key organizational e-mail distributions. In other\nwords, these distributions normally reach a number of staff at the target organization who are\nmotivated by their importance to business, increasing the likelihood of them inadvertently\nexecuting malicious code on their systems.\n\n### Threat Volume\n\nFigure 1 depicts July to September 2015 sessions (individual occurrences) for this threat set.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Predator Pain / HawkEye Sessions, Jul - Sep 2015\n\nObserved sessions revealed an interesting pattern in distribution volume ramping up on\nSunday for peaks over Monday through Wednesday, with significant volume dropping from\nThursday onward. We believe this corresponds with focused business targeting early in the\nworkweek, per the previously noted targeting process employed by most cyber crime actors.\n\n### Delivery\n\nFigure 2 shows the delivery methods observed for the Predator Pain and HawkEye threat set\nover the period of interest, with e-mail by far being the preferred delivery method for\nadversaries.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Predator Pain / HawkEye delivery methods, Jul - Sep 2015\n\nExploring respective phishing attacks further revealed the following lure themes:\n\nNotification or issues with product order or shipping\nNotification or issues with payment, purchase order, invoice, or billing\nProduct or service quotation request\nConfusing, random, and/or purportedly personal topics\n\nTable 1 contains some examples of more common e-mail phishing attack subject and\nattached filename pairings:\n\nEmail Subject Email Attachment Filename\n\nRe: Purchase Order PO #5479423.exe\n\n\nM.V. Chuetsu Spirit V.62A - SI / agency appointment /\nPDI\n\n\nCHUETSU DREAM V.26A SI\nHK.scr\n\n\nDHL AWB# 34 5673 0015 / shipment payment.exe\n\nNew Order ORDER.exe\n\nQuotation. purchase order.exe\n\nTable 1: Lure theming examples for e-mail attacks, July - September 2015\n\n\n-----\n\nRespective malware delivered via malicious e-mail mainly consisted of Microsoft Windows\nPortable Executable (PE) 32-bit and 64-bit binaries. Microsoft Word or RTF documents\nconstituted the remainder of malicious files. Attempted downloads of this threat from web\nand FTP sites were also observed; however, these represented drastically lower occurrences\n(session counts).\n\n### Observed Targeting\n\nWith these distribution methods in mind, Figure 3 shows an AutoFocus visualization for the\n80 countries Unit 42 observed as targeted by the Predator Pain and Hawkeye threat set\nduring the noted time period.\n\nFigure 3: AutoFocus view of Predator Pain / HawkEye targeted countries, Jul - Sep 2015\n\nNot surprisingly, the top-ten list of most highly targeted countries includes 7 of the 23\n[wealthiest in the world, based on GDP per capita:](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-23-richest-countries-in-the-world-2015-7)\n\nUnited States\nAustralia\nCanada\nThailand\nTaiwan ROC\nKuwait\nJapan\nSpain\nItaly\nSweden\n\nThe top ten targeted industries accounted for 82% of sessions:\n\n\n-----\n\nHigh Tech\nHigher Education\nManufacturing\nProfessional and Legal Services\nTransportation and Logistics\nWholesale and Retail\nConstruction\nMedia and Entertainment\nTelecommunications\nGovernment\n\nWe suggest three reasons based on this combination of observed countries and industries\ntargeted:\n\nInnovative organizations are prime targets for a number of adversary motivations due\nto the capabilities and intellectual capital they aggregate.\nService oriented businesses, striving to develop customer relationships are more likely\nto fall victim to phishing attacks due to both organizational culture and incentives for\nclient and customer engagement.\nNatural target saturation occurs within countries with established or thriving\ninfrastructure, enabling malicious actors to reach a broader range of targets remotely\nthrough technology.\n\n### Prevalent Malware Capabilities\n\nThe Predator Pain and HawkEye set of malware is feature rich, compared to most other\nkeyloggers. The following are the capabilities Unit 42 observed as most often enabled for this\nthreat set during the focal time period (ordered by prevalence):\n\nE-mail client credential dump\nWeb browser credential dump\nCollection of system configuration information\nLogging of web browser activity\nLogging of e-mail activity\nScreenshot grabbing\n\n### Exfiltration Method Break-Out\n\nThis threat set includes three main methods of exfiltration: E-mail, PHP-based Web Panel,\nand FTP. Figure 4 shows the HawkEye keylogger’s settings page, where the method\nemployed by an instance can be specified.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: HawkEye keylogger settings screen\n\nThe Predator Pain and HawkEye configurations analyzed by Unit 42 over the focal time\nperiod revealed the following break-out for exfiltration method, with e-mail constituting the\npreferred method across a number of malicious actors:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Predator Pain / HawkEye exfiltration method break-out, Jul – Sep 2015\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPrevention is the best strategy when it comes to the threat posed by keyloggers, such as the\nPredator Pain and HawkEye set. System hardening, integrity assurance, software version\nand patch management, and user awareness are just the first steps towards threat\nmitigation.\n\nRecommendations to protection against this class of threat include:\n\n**Employ multi-factor authentication: Knowledge-based authentication relies on the**\nsecrecy of information. Including elements of what you have (i.e., hardware token) or\nwhat you are (i.e., biometrics) can reduce the value of respective stolen credentials for\nan adversary if that information only satisfies one level in the authentication process.\n**Limit the impact of stolen credential information: Don’t share credentials across**\naccounts and change those credentials periodically. Adversaries commonly engage in\nactivities such as [credential stuffing in an attempt to maximize benefits of stolen](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Credential_stuffing)\ncredentials.\n**Maximize network control and visibility: The latest Verizon DBIR included the**\nfinding that in over 25% of breaches, the organization was notified of the breach\nthrough a third party. Inbound, outbound, and internal network traffic needs to be\ncontrolled and monitored. This is also useful for disrupting malware C2 and exfiltration\nchannels.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Integrate anti-malware automated dynamic analysis (e.g., sandboxing): Identify**\npreviously unknown threats before they become much larger problems on the network.\nGiven the anti-detection tools at the disposal of adversaries, this is a modern necessity.\n**Implement network segmentation: Avoid flat networks, where once an adversary is**\nin they have unrestricted access to internal resources. Network segmentation is a best\npractice for exposing only enough information as is required for specific organizational\nprocesses, moving toward a “zero trust” model. In this context, it is about further\nlimiting the access of an adversary should they successful compromise credentials.\n\n## Additional Reading\n\nThe following are some analyses for the Predator Pain and HawkEye malware threat set that\nexpand on associated capabilities, attributed actors, and observed campaigns:\n\nPalo Alto Networks: [Examining a VBA-Initiated Infostealer Campaign](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/10/examining-vba-initiated-infostealer-campaign/)\nPalo Alto Networks: Follow-On to VBA-Initiated Infostealer Campaign: Exploring\nRelated Malware and Actors\n[Stop Malvertising: Analysis of the Predator Pain Keylogger](http://stopmalvertising.com/malware-reports/analysis-of-the-predator-pain-keylogger.html)\nTrend Micro: [Predator Pain and Limitless - When Cybercrime Turns into Cyberspying](http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-predator-pain-and-limitless.pdf)\n(PDF)\niSIGHT Partners: [HawkEye Keylogger Campaigns Affect Multiple Industries](http://www.isightpartners.com/2015/06/hawkeye-keylogger-campaigns-affect-multiple-industries/)\n[SophosLabs (via Virus Bulletin): MWI-5: Operation HawkEye (PDF)](https://www.virusbtn.com/pdf/magazine/2015/vb201510-MWI-5.pdf)\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
