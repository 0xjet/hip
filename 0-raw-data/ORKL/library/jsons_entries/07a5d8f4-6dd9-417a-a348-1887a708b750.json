The end payload of many of these attacks is AsyncRAT, a\nRemote Access Trojan that can be used to monitor, control, and steal sensitive data from victims'\nmachines.\n\nThailand Pass is an online travel agency that brokers airline tickets to travelers who want to visit\nThailand or other foreign countries. Attackers trick victims using a spoof web page that poses as\nThailand Pass, ultimately baiting users into downloading AsyncRAT.\n\nThe Thailand Pass organization has issued an advisory for these malicious campaigns on their\nofficial website \"tp.consular[.]go[.]th\" as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1: Advisory by Thailand pass organization._**\n\nIn this blog, our team will provide a deep analysis of the malware campaign that we have observed\nrelated to these attacks.\n\nThe below image shows the complete flow of execution for this malware campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: Complete attack chain workflow._**\n\nThe following malicious URLs were used for this campaign, as found through our Threat Intelligence\ncollection framework.\n\nhxxps://bit[.]ly/Thailand-passport - is an shortened URL of\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxps://onedrive.live[.]com/Download?\ncid=6BCBE135551869F2&resid=6BCBE135551869F2!168&authkey=AGoYtbf1Lb5VjFg\n\nOn accessing the above URL, the page delivers a HTML file named “Thailand Pass Registration\n**System (for air travel.html”. Once the user opens the HTML file, it automatically drops an ISO file**\nnamed “thailand_Passport.iso” without any user interaction, as shown below.\n\n**_Figure 3 : Thailand pass phishing page drops ISO file._**\n\nThis ISO file contains a VBScript called “qr_thailand_pass.vbs” file which begins the malware\nactivity. The content of the vbs file will be in obfuscated form as shown below.\n\n**_Figure 4: Obfuscated content of the qr_thailand_pass.vbs file._**\n\nAfter de-obfuscating the VBScript, we can see that the script tries to download a Testavast+denf.txt\nfile from the web hosting site(ec2-34-229-64-131[.]compute-1[.]amazonaws[.]com) and executes the\ncode using the “IEX” operation with the help of “powershell”.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5: Deobfuscated content of the qr_thailand_pass.vbs file._**\n\nThe following image shows the content of the Testavast+denf.txt file which contains a code to check\nif antivirus services ESET, Avast, AVG, or Malwarebytes are running. If any of those services is\nfound, the script modifies the execution flow of the malware to get around the antivirus, and\ndownloads the appropriate files in order to do so. It saves the files related to the antivirus service as\nuntitled.ps1 and executes that powershell script.\n\n**_Figure 6: Checks for AV running service and downloads its related text file accordingly._**\n\nWhile execution flows are modified if AV services are found to be present, the final payload\n(AsyncRAT malware) remains the same.\n\n**IF AV exists on the host machine**\n\n**Example - Victim Machine runs MalwareBytes AV as a service**\n\nHere, we have taken a case study of a host with malwarebytes antivirus installed, and will analyze\nthe delivery of an AsyncRAT payload in detail. The following image shows the content of the killd.txt\nfile which downloads the supporting files from web hosting site(ec2-34-229-64-131[.]compute1[.]amazonaws[.]com)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 7: Content of the powershell script present in the Killd.txt file._**\n\nThe image depicts the content of the supporting files like admin.vbs, admin.ps1, 1_powerrun.vbs,\n1.bat and 1.ps1 whose main task is to stop the particular AV service to evade detection and to\nexecute the malware attack.\n\n**_admin.vbs - Starts the admin.ps1 powershell script_**\n\n**_admin.ps1 - Starts the 1_powerrun.vbs script in admin mode_**\n\n**_1_powerrun.vbs - runs the 1.bat batch file._**\n\n**_1.bat_** - runs the 1.ps1 powershell script.\n\n**_Figure 8: Content of the admin.vbs,admin.ps1,1 powerrun.vbs and 1.bat._**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe final goal of the 1.ps1 powershell script is to stop the MalwareBytes service and add exclusion\nfor the supporting files during the real time scanning as depicted below.\n\n**_Figure 9: Stops the Malwarebytes Antivirus service in Force method._**\n\nAfter disabling the running antivirus service, it downloads the AsyncRAT malware from the killd.txt\nfile and starts its malicious activity on the victim's machine.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 10: Content of the AsyncRAT payload present in the killd.txt file._**\n\nIf no antivirus services are detected on the victim machine then the code will move to the “else” as\nshown below.\n\n**IF AV does not Exist on the host machine**\n\nHere the script downloads “task.txt”, “SecurityHealth.exe” and “SecurityHealth.exe.manifest” files\nfrom the following domain “hxxp://microsoft[.]soundcast[.]me”. Then, it executes the “task.txt” file as\n“untitled.ps1”. It also copies the following “SecurityHealth[.].exe” and\n“SecurityHealth[.]exe[.]manifest” files in the startup folder for persistence techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 11: If AV not exist, download files from “hxxp://microsoft[.]soundcast[.]me/”._**\n\nThe following image shows the content of the Task.txt file which creates a scheduled task as\n**GoogleUpdate to execute the dropped SecurityHealth[.]exe file. This naming fools the user and**\nenables the malware to implement its persistence method.\n\n**_Figure 12: Task.txt file uses persistence technique._**\n\nThe securityHealth[.]exe file needs the SecurityHealth[.]exe[.]manifest supporting file to execute its\nmalicious activities.\n\nThe following image shows the decoded content present in the SecurityHealth[.]exe[.]manifest\ncontaining the URL(34[.]71[.]81[.]158/Run/aaa.ps1) to download the malicious powershell\nscript(aaa.ps1).\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 13: Decoded content present in the SecurityHealth.exe.manifest, downloads aaa.ps1._**\n\nThe downloaded powershell script aaa.ps1 contains the same AyncRAT payload which is present in\nthe killd.txt file(Malwarebytes AV related file).\n\n**_Figure 14: content present in aaa.ps1 file_**\n\n**Final payload AsyncRAT malware - Execution Flow**\n\nThe variable $Filc contains the actual AsyncRAT malware payload, which is injected into a\nlegitimate aspnet_compiler.exe file to show it as a genuine file running in background. The following\nimage shows how the process injection is done in detail.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 15: AsyncRAT payload process injection in legitimate file(aspnet_compiler.exe)._**\n\nWhile decoding the variable $Filc, it results in an AsyncRAT malware file that was hidden inside of it.\nAfter deobfuscation, converted that into a decimal format and then into ASCII to see the actual\nexecutable file (malware payload) as depicted below.\n\n**_Figure 16: Deobfuscated AsyncRAT malware executable._**\n\nThe injected malware payload runs as a legitimate aspnet_compiler.exe process as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 17: Aspnet_compiler is running as a legit file with injected AsyncRAT payload into it._**\n\n**Process Injection - Work Flow**\n\nWe have dissected the deobfuscated AsyncRAT to see how the process injection is accomplished.\nThe following image shows the APIs used for process injection in the Execute method.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 18: Content Present in GetMethod- Execute Function - Process injection APIs._**\n\nThe following APIs are also used to inject the malware AsyncRAT into the legitimate file\naspnet_compiler.exe file.\n\n**_Figure 19: Content Present in GetType - Order.Yes - Process injection APIs._**\n\nThe payload will also check for the Anti-VM and Anti-debugging techniques to evade detection as\nfollows:\n\nHere it checks whether the downloaded malware payload is running in the host or virtual machine,\nand also uses anti-debugging techniques to hide its actual behavior.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 20: Decompiled AsyncRAT file : Anti VM - Anti Debugging techniques._**\n\nFinally, it steals the networking credentials of the victim and sends the stolen information to the\nfollowing C&C server (invoice-update[.]myiphost[.]com) as shown below.\n\n**_Figure 21: Decompiled AsyncRAT file - C&C server location._**\n\n**Similar campaign - Delivery using Discord CDN:**\n\n\n-----\n\ncdn[.]discordapp[.]com/attachments/921529408060289114/947221997325258772/qr_thailand_pass.zip\n\nWe have seen several other Thailand Pass organization spam templates that directly deliver the\nVBScript file that leads to the delivery of the same AsyncRAT malware, as shown below.\n\n**_Figure 22: Thailand pass downloads VBScript file directly._**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAsyncRAT – like other Remote Access Trojans – is a powerful malware that plays a significant role\nin cybercriminal activities. ThreatLabz actively tracks these types of malware attacks to protect our\ncustomers from data theft and from other sensitive information being abused by the cybercriminals.\n\n**IOCs:**\n\n**URLs:**\n\nbit[.]ly/Thailand-passport\n\nonedrive[.]live[.]com/Download?\ncid=6BCBE135551869F2&resid=6BCBE135551869F2!168&authkey=AGoYtbf1Lb5VjFg\n\nec2-34-229-64-131[.]compute-1[.]amazonaws[.]com/New/Testavast+denf[.]txt\n\nec2-34-229-64-131[.]compute-1[.]amazonaws[.]com/New/Nod[.]txt\n\nec2-34-229-64-131[.]compute-1[.]amazonaws[.]com/New/Avast[.]txt\n\nec2-34-229-64-131[.]compute-1[.]amazonaws[.]com/New/Killd[.]txt\n\nec2-34-229-64-131[.]compute-1[.]amazonaws[.]com/SV/Malawer/1[.]bat\n\nec2-34-229-64-131[.]compute-1[.]amazonaws[.]com/SV/Malawer/1[.]ps1\n\nec2-34-229-64-131[.]compute-1[.]amazonaws[.]com/SV/Malawer/1 powerrun[.]vbs\n\n\n-----\n\nec2-34-229-64-131[.]compute-1[.]amazonaws[.]com/SV/Malawer/PowerRun[.]exe\n\nec2-34-229-64-131[.]compute-1[.]amazonaws[.]com/SV/Malawer/admin[.]ps1\n\nec2-34-229-64-131[.]compute-1[.]amazonaws[.]com/SV/Malawer/admin[.]vbs\n\nmicrosoft[.]soundcast[.]me/Run/task[.]txt\n\nmicrosoft[.]soundcast[.]me/Run/SecurityHealth[.]exe\n\nmicrosoft[.]soundcast[.]me/Run/SecurityHealth[.]exe[.]manifest\n\n34[.]71.81[.]158\n\ncdn[.]discordapp[.]com/attachments/921529408060289114/947221997325258772/qr_thailand_pass.zip\n\n**Hashes:**\n\n9f0a23cf792d72d89010df5e219b4b12 - Thailand pass[.]html\n\ne2da247426a520209f7d993332818b40 - Thailand pass[.]ISO\n\n8f30215a81f2a2950fd5551d4f2212ce - QR_thailand_pass[.]vbs\n\ne8e4ea0f80c9ff49df07e9c1b119ba2a - Security health[.]exe\n\n25ed250f143d623d0d41bd9123bcc509 - SecurityHealth[.]exe[.]manifest\n\n4e6d695ed0559da97c9f081acf0892e4 - AsyncRAT Payload\n\n2922a998d5b202ff9df4c40bce0a6119 - Process injector\n\nb64ac660f13b24f99999e7376424df2d - Killd.txt\n\n984f6bd06024f8e7df2f9ec9e05ae3d2 - Avast.txt\n\na5dfd5b75db6529b6bd359e02229ad1d - Nod.txt\n\n9c0bdb129084a6c8fce1a1e9d153374b - Admin.ps1\n\n7ec50ec3091ff38eb7c43e2a8a253bc9 - 1.ps1\n\nae29fc1878f3471bb196ba353b3daf9d - 1_powerrun.vbs\n\n44314f46a2beb1cc20a0798533f0913E - 1.bat\n\n878b1aae24a87bc0dbce537336878b5E - Admin.vbs\n\n**C&C:**\n\ninvoice-update[.]myiphost[.]com\n\n**Detection & Coverage:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Advanced Sandbox Report:**\n\n**_Figure 23:Zscaler Sandbox detection_**\n\n**Advanced Threat Protection:**\n\nWin32.Downloader.AsyncRAT\n\nHTML.Phish.ThailandPass\n\nVBS.Dropper.AsyncRAT\n\nWin32.Backdoor.AsyncRAT\n\nPS.Downloader.AsyncRAT\n\nWin32.Trojan.NETAssemblyInject\n\n**About us**\n\n[Zscaler ThreatLabz is a global threat research team with a mission to protect customers from](https://www.zscaler.com/threatlabz/)\nadvanced cyberthreats.
