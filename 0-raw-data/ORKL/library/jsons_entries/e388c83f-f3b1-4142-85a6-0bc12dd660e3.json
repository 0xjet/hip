Another Android trojan called TeaBot (aka Anatsa) has been observed lurking on](https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/experts-warn-of-new-android-banking.html)\nthe Google Play Store in the form of an app named \"QR Code Reader - Scanner App,\" attracting no\nfewer than 100,000 downloads while delivering 17 different variants of the malware between\nDecember 6, 2021, and January 17, 2022.\n\nIn a tactic that's becoming increasingly common, the app does offer the promised functionality, but\nit's also designed to retrieve a malicious APK file hosted on GitHub, but not before ascertaining that\nthe country code of the current registered operator doesn't start with a \"U.\"\n\nThe installation of the rogue app then involves presenting a fake UI notifying the user that an add[on update is required and that the setting to allow installs from unknown sources needs to be](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/2812853?hl=en)\nenabled in order to apply the update.\n\n\n-----\n\nBitDefender said it identified four more dropper apps — 2FA Authenticator, QR Scanner APK, QR\nCode Scan, and Smart Cleaner — that were available on the Play Store and distributed the TeaBot\nmalware since at least April 2021.\n\nAnother technique of interest adopted by the operators is versioning, which works by submitting a\nbenign version of an app to the app store for purposes of evading the review process put in place\nby Google, only to replace the codebase over time with additional malicious functionality through\nupdates at a later date.\n\nBeyond circumventing the Play Store protections to reach a wider infection pool, the malware\nauthors are believed to have paid to appear in Google Ads served within other legitimate\napplications and games, \"giving them screen time in an app that could have millions of users.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThe analysis also corroborates a previous report from Dutch cybersecurity firm ThreatFabric, which\n[found six Anatsa droppers on the Play Store since June 2021. The apps were programmed to](https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/4-android-banking-trojan-campaigns.html)\ndownload an \"update\" followed by prompting users to grant them Accessibility Service privileges\nand permissions to install apps from unknown third-party sources.\n\nIn a related development, researchers from Pradeo found that a two-factor authenticator app called\n\"2FA Authenticator\" distributed through the Google Play store and downloaded more than 10,000\n[times was saddled with a banking trojan named Vultr, which targets financial services to steal users'](https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/new-android-malware-uses-vnc-to-spy-and.html)\nbanking information.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\n\"The application called 2FA Authenticator is a dropper leveraged to spread malware on its users'\n[devices,\" the researchers said. \"It has been developed to look legitimate and provide a real service.](https://blog.pradeo.com/vultur-malware-dropper-google-play)\nTo do so, its developers used the open-source code of the official Aegis authentication application\nto which they injected malicious code.\"\n\n\"Malicious actors treat malware like a product, with development and versioning, working hard to\ncircumvent security technologies and gain more victims,\" Richard Melick, director of product\nstrategy for endpoint security at Zimperium, said.\n\n\"When one version gets disrupted, the malicious actors go back to developing the next version,\nespecially when the outcomes have been effective. And the mobile endpoint is an incredibly\nlucrative target for attackers,\" Melick added.\n\n\n-----\n\n## From GriftHorse to Dark Herring\n\nThe development comes as Zimperium zLabs disclosed details of yet another premium service\n[abuse campaign along the lines of GriftHorse that leveraged as many as 470 innocuous-looking](https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/beware-this-android-trojan-stole.html)\napps to subscribe users to paid services costing $15 per month without their knowledge.\n\nThe billing fraud, also categorized as \"fleeceware,\" is said to have affected upwards of 105 million\nusers across more than 70 countries, with most victims located in Egypt, Finland, India, Pakistan,\nand Sweden.\n\nThe mammoth operation, which the mobile security company codenamed \"Dark Herring,\" has been\nbacktraced to March 2020, making it one of the longest-running mobile SMS scams discovered to\ndate.\n\nWhile the huge nest of trojan apps have since been purged from the Play Store, they are still\navailable on third-party app stores, once again underscoring the potential dangers when it comes to\nsideloading applications onto mobile devices.\n\n\"In addition to over 470 Android applications, the distribution of the applications was extremely wellplanned, spreading their apps across multiple, varied categories, widening the range of potential\n[victims,\" Zimperium researcher Aazim Yaswant said. \"The apps themselves also functioned as](https://blog.zimperium.com/dark-herring-android-scamware-exceeds-100m-installations/)\nadvertised, increasing the false sense of confidence.\"\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
