For those blissfully\nunaware of TeDi, among the ShadowBrokers leaks we find two files far more noteworthy for\nthreat intelligencers than the exploits and tools. Dr. Boldizar Bencsath and his team at\nCrySyS lab were the first to notice the value of ‘sigs.py’ and ‘drv_list.txt’. The former\nincludes filenames and registry keys associated umbrellaed under a moniker ‘SIG[1-45]’.\nThe [CrySyS lab report is an excellent starting point to understand the contents of TeDi.](https://www.crysys.hu/publications/files/tedi/ukatemicrysys_territorialdispute.pdf)\n\nSince the release of this report in 2018, further signatures have been identified by\nKaspersky’s GReAT team and by Silas Cutler and I during our time at Chronicle’s\nUppercase. Today, I’ll focus on a specific misidentified TeDi signature, SIG37. These\nsignatures are low fidelity –composed of a combination of paths, filenames, and registry\nkeys– and thereby prone to misidentification. In this case, CrySyS lab tentatively identifies\nSIG37 as ‘IronTiger_ASPXSpy’ –a presumably Chinese APT group better known as\n[‘Emissary Panda’ among other names. CrySyS lab points to a file in VirusTotal whose](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/fb253831862d882b0d22cb2cb2a80d423cae92a6218ac3d126fafcadf75afd0b/detection)\ncommunity comments suggest the aforementioned detection.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Automated community comment with the misleading detection_\n\nAs many VT obsessives know, all sorts of misleading and undesirable files make their way\ninto the VT corpus and fire off our YARA rules. Upon closer inspection, the file above is a\n15mb memory dump of a McAfee installer, perhaps by someone interested in their malware\nsignatures. As such, it’s a giant malformed mess of unrelated indicators. With that\nunderstanding, we can discard the commented detection and return to the abject mystery of\nidentifying SIG37. The signature itself refers only to a single filename: ‘godown.dll’\n\n## The Nazar APT\n\n_SIG37 function from ‘sigs.py’_\n\nArmed with this spartan indicator, what we find is a previously unidentified cluster of activity\npossibly ranging as far back as early as 2008 –though more likely centered around 2010–\n2013 that I’ve nicknamed ‘Nazar’. The name is derived from debug paths left alongside\nFarsi resources in some of the malware droppers described below. Those PDB paths refer\nto a source root folder: ‘khzer’.\n\n\n-----\n\nNative Farsi speakers pointed me in the direction of the term ‘nazar’ –roughly translating to\n‘supervision’ or ‘monitoring’– transliterated and mangled from Persian to Roman characters.\nA more recognizable alternative interpretation is the nazar amulet used for protection\nagainst ‘evil eye’. Some level of speculation is involved so I won’t belabor the point beyond\nemojying the name ( 🧿) for tweetable convenience.\n\n\n-----\n\n_‘Evil eye’ protection amulets– the better known ‘hamsa’ (left) or ‘nazar’ (right)_\n\nIt’s hard to understand the scope of this operation without access to victimology (e.g.:\nendpoint visibility or command-and-control sinkholing). Additionally, some possible\ntimestomping muddies the water between this operation possible originating in 2008-2009\nor actually coming into full force in 2010-2013 (the latter dates being corroborated by VT\nfirstseen submission times and second-stage drop timestamps). There’s a level of variable\ndevelopmental capability visible throughout the stages. Multiple components are abused\ncommonly-available resources, while the orchestrator and two of the DLL drops actually\n\n\n-----\n\ndisplay some developmental ingenuity (in the form of seemingly novel COM techniques).\nFar from the most advanced coding practices but definitely better than the sort of .NET\ngarbage other ‘Farsi-speaking’ APTs have gotten away with in the past.\n\nSomehow, this operation found its way onto the NSA’s radar pre-2013. As far as I can tell,\nit’s eluded specific coverage from the security industry. A possible scenario to account for\nthe disparate visibility between the NSA and Western researchers when it comes to this\ncluster of activity is that these samples were exclusively encountered on Iranian boxes\noverlapping with EQGRP implants. Submissions of Nazar subcomponents from Iran (as\nwell as privately shared visibility into historical and ongoing victimology clustered entirely on\nIranian machines) could support that theory. Perhaps this is an internal monitoring\nframework (a la [Attor) but given the sparse availability of historical data, I wouldn’t push that](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ESET_Attor.pdf)\nbeyond a low-confidence assessment, at this time.\n\nI hope interested researchers take this as an initial introduction and open challenge to\ncontribute to what may prove a previously unknown threat actor, and encourage them to\nleverage their greater abilities and visibility to contribute to the ongoing research. I’ll gladly\nupdate this post with the contributions and publications of others.\n\n## Technical Breakdown\n\nNazar employs a modular toolkit where a main dropper silently registers multiple DLLs as\nOLE controls in the Windows registry via ‘regsvr32.exe’. An orchestrator (‘Data.bin’),\ndisguised as the generic Windows service host process (‘svchost.exe’), is registered as a\nservice (‘EYService’) for persistence. The DLLs are a combination of custom type libraries\nand resourceful repurposing of more widely available libraries for nefarious purposes.\n\n_Nazar component structure_\n\n\n-----\n\n**The Dropper: GpUpdates.exe**\n\nSHA256 4d0ab3951df93589a874192569cac88f7107f595600e274f52e2b75f68593bca\n\nSHA1 48f99144bb9fdf379926e85fbe3caa462089f397\n\nMD5 6b3116580d29020b9c259877ac18a7fd\n\nFilename GpUpdates.exe\n\nTimestamp 2009-10-31 12:28:29\n\n\nFirst\nSubmission\n\n\n2013-02-04 04:23:00\n\n\nThe droppers are misidentified as packed by Armadillo but in reality they’re built using now\n[defunct Chilkat software, ‘Zip2Secure’ to create self-extracting executables. The packing](https://www.chilkatsoft.com/ChilkatSfx.asp)\nalone has led the droppers to be detected under generic AV detections but the\nsubcomponents have low-to-no detections at this time.\n\n**The Setup Agent: ‘Distribute.exe’**\n\nSHA256 839c3e6ba65e5d07a2e0c4dd4a2c0d7ae95a266431dd3f8971b8a37d17b1ddf6\n\nSHA1 05122010cde4dcd1b4cd55de7b7d442efda19976\n\nMD5 c1ab32afb0e2d7b7b1cad3fb831e9373\n\nFilename Distribute.exe\n\nTimestamp 2012-03-17 11:07:53\n\n\nFirst\nSubmission\n\n\n2013-02-04 04:26:29\n\n\nThe Zip2Secure configuration entrusts the distribution of the files contained therein to\n‘Distribute.exe’, which places the files and silently registers the subcomponents with\nregsvr32.exe.\n\n**The Orchestrator: ‘EYService’**\n\nSHA256 2fe9b76496a9480273357b6d35c012809bfa3ae8976813a7f5f4959402e3fbb6\n\nSHA1 79f2b98821c1e2717a0495e6c5c76a0147b21aae\n\nMD5 a9ff31c8db6d4e70829bf5db062d1b9c\n\nFilename Data.bin, svchost.exe, EYService\n\n\n-----\n\nTimestamp 2012-04-30 05:12:18\n\n\nFirst\nSubmission\n\n\n2013-02-04 08:43:33\n\n\nThe main functionality orchestrating the different subcomponents is contained within\nData.bin, later renamed to ‘svchost.exe’. The orchestrator takes 17 different three digit\ncodes to divert functionality within a giant switch statement. Some of the codes have not\nbeen fully implemented up to the latest samples I’ve found so far, which further suggests a\ncontinued developmental effort.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**[Updated 04.28.2020]: Thanks to @maciekkotowicz’s great work, we now know that**\nEYservice is in fact a passive backdoor with no hardcoded infrastructure. The backdoor is\nlistening for UDP packets on port ‘1234’ and allows for a ping response, victim info request,\n[or file download. For further details, please refer to the MalwareLab.pl blog.](https://blog.malwarelab.pl/posts/nazar_eyservice_comm/)\n\n**The Subcomponent DLLs**\n\nSubcomponent DLLs include multiple abused resources as well as a couple of seemingly\ncustom libraries. The former include the common LAME MP3 encoding library (UPX\npacked) as well as a more obscure bitmap library. These are abused to implement hot mic\nand screengrab features, respectively. Another subcomponent is the ‘hodl.dll’ (internally\nnamed ‘keydll3.dll’) library used for keylogging. This appears to be a more common\nkeylogger but that claim could use further scrutiny.\n\nFinally, the custom libraries are ‘godown.dll’ (our original indicator) as well as ‘filesystem.dll’.\nBoth are treated as type libraries and registered as OLE controls. The Filesystem library\nincludes functionality to enumerate attached drives and traverse folder structures. The\nGoDown library is used for system shutdown. [Updated 04.28.2020]\n\nFor a more comprehensive breakdown of these components, refer to the Checkpoint\n[Research blogpost [Updated 05.05.2020].](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/nazar-spirits-of-the-past/)\n\n**A Further Oddity – The MicroOlap Packet Sniffer**\n\nA core function of EYService includes a further drop, a packet sniffer. The orchestrator will\nunpack and drop a kernel driver (pssdk41.vxd, pssdk41.sys) used to sniff packets from the\nvictim machine’s interfaces. The packets are then parsed looking for something in particular.\nPerhaps this allows for a sneaky means of command-and-control or more sophisticated\nuses. At this time, I’ve not determined what it’s parsing in particular.\n\nInterestingly, the packet sniffer is also referenced in the EQGRP drv_list.txt. Other versions\nare also referenced, as shown in the image below:\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, focusing on the alternate filenames brought up an earlier version of this Nazar\norchestrator (sha256:\n1c02043ca00d087f1aac0337f89bf205985e1f20641bf043c9b7b99e0c9dc002). This earlier\nversion drops ‘pssdk31.drv’ instead of the 4.1 version mentioned above.\n\n**Avenues for Further Research**\n\nSIG37 has proven a rewarding mystery, unearthing a previously undiscovered subset of\nactivity worthy of our attention. Apart from several places where more skilled reverse\nengineers can contribute to better understanding the samples already discovered, there’s\nan opportunity for threat hunters with access to diverse data sets and systems to figure out\njust how big this iceberg really is. Are we looking at an internal surveillance framework? Is\nthis part of an already known cluster of activity? Or can we add another predatory animal to\nour overpopulated zoo?\n\nHappy Hunting!\n\n## Appendix – Technical Indicators\n\n**Nazar Hashes**\n\n**gpUpdates.exe**\n\n4d0ab3951df93589a874192569cac88f7107f595600e274f52e2b75f68593bca\n\nd34a996826ea5a028f5b4713c797247913f036ca0063cc4c18d8b04736fa0b65\n\neb705459c2b37fba5747c73ce4870497aa1d4de22c97aaea4af38cdc899b51d3\n\nd9801b4da1dbc5264e83029abb93e800d3c9971c650ecc2df5f85bcc10c7bd61\n\n**Unnamed Droppers**\n\n75e4d73252c753cd8e177820eb261cd72fecd7360cc8ec3feeab7bd129c01ff6\n\n\n-----\n\n1110c3e34b6bbaadc5082fabbdd69f492f3b1480724b879a3df0035ff487fd6f\n\n**Distribute.exe**\n\n6b8ea9a156d495ec089710710ce3f4b1e19251c1d0e5b2c21bbeeab05e7b331f\n\n**svchost.exe**\n\n2fe9b76496a9480273357b6d35c012809bfa3ae8976813a7f5f4959402e3fbb6\n\n**Filesystem.dll**\n\n1110c3e34b6bbaadc5082fabbdd69f492f3b1480724b879a3df0035ff487fd6f\n\n**Godown.dll**\n\n967ac245e8429e3b725463a5c4c42fbdf98385ee6f25254e48b9492df21f2d0b\n\n8fb9a22b20a338d90c7ceb9424d079a61ca7ccb7f78ffb7d74d2f403ae9fbeec\n\n**hodll.dll**\n\n0c09fedc5c74f90883cd3256a181d03e4376d13676c1fe266dbd04778a929198\n\n**Abused Common Resources**\n\n**pssdk41.sys**\n\n048208864c793a670159723b38c3ea1474ccc62e06b90833bdf1683b8026e12f\n\n**ViewScreen.dll**\n\n5a924dec60c623cf73f5b8505e11512ad85e62ac571a840ab0ff48d4a04b60de\n\n**lame_enc.dll**\n\nc84100d52c09703e32951444bd7ba4e22c5d41193e7420aacbbc1f736f4c4e1f\n\n0091e2101f00751c4020ef8e115cfe12a284c9abacc886f549b40a62574a7510\n\n[YARA rules available here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juanandresgs/YARA/master/apt_ZZ_Sig37_NAZAR.yara)\n\n[J A G-S](http://10.10.0.46/blog?author=5de05bd68772d028587d08bf)\n\n\n-----",
