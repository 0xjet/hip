Security research has\nattributed the exploitation to the Advanced\nPersistent Threat group known as Hafnium\noperating out of China. After the initial\ncompromise, Hafnium operators accessed email\naccounts and deployed web shells on the\ncompromised servers, which they then used to steal data and expand the attack. Since\nenterprises deploy Outlook Web Access (OWA) on public networks, it enabled the group to\ncompromise many organizations across a large set of industries, according to ThreatPost’s\nblog.\n\nConsidering the criticality of the vulnerabilities, Microsoft released out-of-band patches on\nMarch 2, 2021, to fix the reported vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, many organizations have not\npatched immediately, and attackers compromised them before the patch was available,\nresulting in the group using the web shell backdoor to move further inside the network.\nVolexity confirmed the attackers combined the Exchange exploitation with another\nvulnerability, CVE-2021-27065, to perform remote code execution (RCE) and conduct lateral\nmovement.\n\n\n-----\n\nAttivo Networks advises all customers who use vulnerable Exchange Server versions to\napply the patch immediately to prevent a compromise. It is also imperative for organizations\nto know if the Hafnium group has moved laterally inside the network prior to patching\nExchange Servers.\n\n[Volexity’s blog summarizes the threat’s criticality for enterprises if the adversary has targeted](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/03/02/active-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities/)\nthem.\n\n**_“In all cases of RCE (remote code execution), Volexity has observed the attacker_**\n**_writing web shells (ASPX files) to disk and conducting further operations to dump_**\n**_credentials, add user accounts, steal copies of the Active Directory database_**\n**_(NTDS.DIT), and move laterally to other systems and environments.”_**\n\nHaving robust products and processes to detect lateral movement early before the adversary\ngains a foothold deep inside the enterprise’s network and systems is critical to protect its\ndata and “crown jewels.” Fortunately, there are mature tools available to detect lateral\nmovement accurately without incurring significant investment.\n\n**How can Attivo Networks customers detect if they have been exploited and are**\n**attempting to move laterally?**\n\nAttivo Networks prevents and detects lateral movement and privilege escalation inside the\nnetwork by specializing in protecting identities, credentials, and high-value assets across\nendpoints, Active Directory, and cloud infrastructure.\n\nBelow are five examples of Indicators of Compromise captured by Attivo solutions, related to\ndocumented adversary activity specific to the group:\n\n1.The attacker used MITRE ATT&CK Techniques T1003.001, Dumping lsass.exe Process\nMemory to steal privileged Credentials from Exchange Server using procdump64.exe.\n\n2.Although researchers did not document this specific technique, adversaries widely use\nMITRE ATT&CK Techniques T1003.001, Dumping lsass.exe Process Memory to Get\nCredentials using Mimikatz.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf attackers use these techniques, the Attivo solutions would report the following events.\n\n3.The attackers created Local Admin accounts for persistence. The Attivo EDN ThreatPath\nmodule reports when attackers create new Local Admins, Privileged Domain accounts, or\nDelegated Admin accounts (MITRE ATT&CK Techniques T1136). The EDN ADSecure\nmodule prevents adversaries from exploiting domain privileged and local admin accounts by\npreventing access to them.\n4.The group used PSExec against a Remote System (MITRE ATT&CK Techniques T1021).\n\n\n-----\n\n5.Attackers also added Exchange PowerShell snap-ins to export Mailbox Data (MITRE\nATT&CK Techniques T1059).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis incident is another example of how sophisticated attackers can combine multiple attack\ntechniques to exploit and move laterally inside the enterprise. Prevention technologies and\npatching are critical, but they are not enough, as the attackers have demonstrated.\nCustomers need solutions that will detect adversaries early as they move inside the network\nto access sensitive or essential data, and Attivo offerings do just that.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Share on:\n\n Free Active Directory Assessment\n\n### Get Visibility Into Privilege And Service Account Exposure\n\nFor a limited time, Attivo Networks is providing free Active Directory Security Assessments to\ndemonstrate how ADAssessor provides unprecedented and continuous visibility to AD\nvulnerabilities.\n\n[Get Started](https://www.attivonetworks.com/active-directory-assessment-sign-up/)\n\n## Try Our Endpoint Detection Net (EDN) for Free\n\nFAST AND EASY\n\nFree use offer of our Award-winning security solution to prevent attackers from lateral\nmovement, credential theft, and privilege escalation, fast and easy.\n\n[Sign up now](https://www.attivonetworks.com/endpoint-detection-net-offer/)\n\n## Newsletter Signup\n\nYes, please opt me in to receive your quarterly newsletter, event invitations, and\nproduct updates.\n\nI understand that I can opt out at any time, and can refer to Attivo Networks Privacy\nPolicy for more information.\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\n## ADSecure 90-Day Free Trial\n\n### GET PROTECTION AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO ACTIVE DIRECTORY\n\nHide and deny access to AD objects\nGet alerted on unauthorized queries\nAttack details easily viewable in dashboard\n\n\n-----\n\nYour data remains on-premise\n\n[Sign me up](https://www.attivonetworks.com/adsecure-trial-guide/)\n\n## RSS\n\n### Leave a Comment\n\nYour email address will not be published.
