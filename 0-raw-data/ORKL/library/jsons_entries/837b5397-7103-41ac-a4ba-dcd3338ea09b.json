between\n\n# A\n\nthe level of security they need for their networks and the\nlevel of security available to them using traditional security\ntools. That’s because the next generation of cyber attacks are\nalready a part of their daily lives, but they’re stuck working\nwith traditional security tools that are based on decades-old\ntechnology models.\n\nThe entire security industry needs a shift in thinking because\nincremental improvements can’t bridge the threat gap created\nby today’s highly adept cybercriminals. I’ve said very publicly\nthat the current cybersecurity model isn’t extensible and\nrequires a fundamentally new approach to security.\n\nThat’s why I am extremely encouraged after reading this\ndefinitive guide. I’m more convinced than ever that we need to\nbe educating each other and acting upon the reality of today’s\ncyber attacks. We are in a cyber “arms race” run by criminal\nand nation-state organizations with interlocking profit motives\nand geopolitical agendas. It’s getting ugly out there.\n\nI am honored to serve as a member of President Barack\nObama’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory\nCommittee as well as on the boards of Delta Airlines,\nMandiant, and Polycom. From this perspective, we have a\nunique opportunity to unite the public and private sectors in a\ncommon cause. Together, I'm confident we will find innovative\nsolutions to protect our shared critical infrastructure.\n\nIt is still staggering to me that cybercriminals and APT actors\ncan break into virtually any network to steal data and disrupt\nbusinesses despite the over $20 billion invested in IT security\ntechnologies last year!\n\nThis guide is all about how to fill this gap in our network\ndefenses to do battle against “today’s new breed of cyber\nattacks,” as Steve puts it in this book. The dramatic rise in\nglobal cyber incidents shows just how far the threats have\n\n\n-----\n\nhave become. I urge you to read this guide and share what you\nlearn with your colleagues and peer networking groups. We\ncan’t stop this next- generation of cyber attacks without more\nadvanced technologies, better cooperation across industries,\nand stronger ties between the public and private sectors.\n\nFor my part, in joining FireEye, I consider this my renewed\npledge to deliver leading-edge platforms to address today’s\ntoughest cybersecurity issues. I considered numerous CEO\nopportunities since McAfee and have watched FireEye on the\nsidelines for years. I am so excited to join a company with\nsuch game-changing technology. And, by sponsoring this\nguide, my hope is that it will give you a framework to deploy\na next-generation threat protection platform that forms the\nbasis of a more resilient, penetration-resistant network.\n\n**David DeWalt**\n**CEO, FireEye**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Introduction\n\nn recent years, enterprises and government agencies have\nfallen prey to a myriad of successful cyber attacks of unprec\n# I\n\nedented sophistication and reach. Despite spending over $20\nbillion annually on traditional security defenses, organizations\nfind themselves battling a new generation of cyber attacks,\nsuch as advanced malware and advanced persistent threats\n(APTs), that are dynamic and stealthy and extremely successful at compromising today’s networks.\n\nIf there’s any chance of preventing these motivated adversaries\nfrom attacking our systems, stealing our data, and harming\nour critical infrastructure, we’ve got to think differently. We\nmust realize the limitations of traditional signature-based\ndefenses and leverage new technology to uncover and stop\ntoday’s new breed of cyber attacks.\n\nFortunately, there is a solution. Introducing next-generation\nthreat protection (NGTP), an innovative new network security\nplatform proven to help win the war against next-generation\nthreats. If you’re charged with securing your organization’s\nnetwork, this is one book you simply can’t afford to miss.\n\n###### Chapters at a Glance\n\n**Chapter 1, “Defining Next-Generation Threats,”**\nreviews staggering statistics on major data breaches, describes\nrecent high-profile commercial and government cyber attacks,\ndepicts typical costs associated with successful breaches, and\ncontrasts traditional and next-generation cyber attacks.\n\n**Chapter 2, “Understanding the Enemy,” categorizes**\nthree kinds of cyber enemies — cybercriminals, state-sponsored threat actors, and hacktivists — and describes why they\nare so successful in bypassing traditional security defenses.\n\n**Chapter 3, “Anatomy of Advanced Cyber Attacks,”**\ndefines APTs and reviews high-profile examples that have\n\ntl d i t ti l h dli Th h t th\n\n\n-----\n\nTIP\n\n\ndetails the potential “ripple effect” of a successful APT on critical infrastructure, explores each of the five stages of the APT\nlife cycle, and provides telltale signs for detecting APTs in your\norganization.\n\n**Chapter 4, “Introducing Next-Generation Threat**\n**Protection,” gets to the heart of the matter by defining**\nNGTP, describing the characteristics of an ideal NGTP solution, and comparing NGTP to traditional signature-based\ndefenses and sandbox technologies.\n\n**Chapter 5, “Next-Generation Threat Protection**\n**Explored,” expands on Chapter 4 by explaining exactly**\nhow NGTP mitigates the new breed of cyber attacks in email\nmessages, Web communications, and files at rest. It explores\nkey features of leading NGTP solutions and describes common\nways to integrate them into existing network infrastructure.\n\n**Chapter 6, “Selecting the Right NGTP Solution,”**\ndescribes exactly what to look for — and, more importantly,\nwhat to avoid — when shopping for an NGTP solution.\n\n**Glossary provides handy definitions to key terminology**\n(appearing in italics) used throughout this book.\n\n###### Helpful Icons\n\nTips provide practical advice that you can apply in your own\norganization.\n\n\nDON’T FORGET\n\nCAUTION\n\nTECH TALK\n\nON THE WEB\n\n\nWhen you see this icon, take note as the related content contains key information that you won’t want to forget.\n\nProceed with caution because if you don’t it may prove costly\nto you and your organization.\n\nContent associated with this icon is more technical in nature\nand is intended for IT practitioners.\n\nWant to learn more?

In\nthe past year, we’ve witnessed alarming data breaches of\n\n# T\n\nunprecedented complexity and scale, causing every CISO to\nre-examine the organization’s network security posture.\n\nAt the same time, the cybercrime industry has completely\ntransformed — from hacking for kicks to cyber attacks for\nprofit, or in some instances, for political gain. Today’s cyber_criminals are highly trained and incorporate sophisticated_\nattack techniques that are no match for today’s inadequate\nsignature-based defenses.\n\nOrganizations now face a new breed of cyber attacks. These\n_multi-vectored and multi-staged threats easily evade tradi-_\ntional security defenses, such as firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), secure Web and email gateways, and\nanti-virus platforms.\n\nSo, how bad has the problem become? Let’s take a look at\nsome recent statistics and references to some of the most\nheinous cyber attacks of our day.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Staggering Statistics\n\nSeveral reputable cybersecurity research organizations monitor cyber attack trends against enterprises. Among these is\nthe Verizon RISK (Response, Intelligence, Solutions, and\nKnowledge) Team, which publishes a widely regarded annual\nData Breach Investigations Report.\n\nIn 2012, Verizon analyzed 855 data breach incidents\nthat occurred in the prior year resulting in 174 million\ncompromised records. Verizon’s analysis yielded some\nstaggering statistics:\n\n###### ;; [98 percent of the incidents stemmed from external ]\n\nagents (up 6 percent from the prior year)\n###### ;; [85 percent took weeks to discover (up 6 percent)]\n\n\nON THE WEB\n\nON THE WEB\n\n\n###### ;; [81 percent involved some form of hacking (up 31 ]\n\npercent)\n###### ;; [69 percent incorporated malware (up 20 percent)]\n\nTo download a free copy of the Verizon report, connect to\nwww.verizonbusiness.com.\n\nAlso in 2012, FireEye, a leader in next-generation threat\nprotection, published its Advanced Threat Report (1H 2012).\nAccording to the report, enterprises are experiencing an average of 643 Web-based malicious events each week effectively\npenetrating traditional security defenses, such as firewalls,\nintrusion prevention systems, and anti-virus software.\nCompared to the same period in 2011, the number of infections per company rose by 225 percent.\n\nTo download a free copy of the FireEye report, connect to\nwww.fireeye.com/info-center/.\n\nDespite global increases in information security spending\n(currently equating to over $20 billion per year for information security products and services), the percentage of data\nbreaches stemming from external hacking is up, attacks incorporating malware are up, and it’s still taking weeks to discover\nmajor data breaches!\n\n\n-----\n\nTIP\n\n\n###### Recent Victims\n\nUnless enterprises and government agencies adopt a new,\nmore sophisticated approach to mitigating next-generation\nthreats, organizations will continue to make headlines in ways\nthey never intended. The following is a sampling of recent\nhigh-profile commercial and government cyber attacks that\nincorporated advanced hacking techniques:\n\n###### Commercial attacks\n\n ;; Global Payments (March 2012): Attack dating\nback to January 2011 in which a hacker exfiltrated\ninformation for over 7 million credit cards, costing\nthis credit card processor nearly $85 million and\ntemporary delisting by Visa and MasterCard.\n###### ;; Citigroup (June 2011): The company disclosed\nthat a cyber attack resulted in the theft of more than\n360,000 credit card numbers, of which 3,400 were\nused to steal more than $2.7 million.\n###### ;; RSA Security (March 2011): Cyber attackers stole\ndata related to SecurID tokens, rendering them\ninsecure.\n\nJump to the “RSA Security steps forward to describe their APT\nattack” sidebar in Chapter 3 for details of this attack.\n\n###### Government attacks\n\n ;; [South Carolina Department of Revenue][ (October ]\n\n2012): A hacker exfiltrated approximately 3.6 million\nSocial Security numbers and 387,000 credit and debit\ncard numbers from an external cyber attack.\n###### ;; [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]\n\n(August 2012): Social Security numbers, bank routing\nnumbers, and home addresses of more than 5,000\nEPA employees were exposed after an employee\nclicked on a malicious email attachment.\n###### ;; [Iran][ (May 2012): Flame malware allegedly developed ]\n\nby the United States and Israel was deployed to slow\nthe Iranian nuclear program\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Cost of Failure\n\nDON’T FORGET To mitigate both traditional and next-generation threats, IT\nsecurity organizations must implement a defense-in-depth\nstrategy (layers of network and endpoint security defenses).\nFailing to do so can prove costly. In fact, it can bankrupt\na company!\n\nIn 2012, Ponemon Institute (www.ponemon.org) published\na third annual report titled “2012 Cost of Cyber Crime Study:\nUnited States.” Upon analyzing the cost of data breaches\nfor 56 U.S.-based enterprises, Ponemon found the average\nannualized cost of cybercrime for each organization to be $8.9\nmillion, with a range of $1.4 million to $46 million. This is\nup from $8.4 million (6 percent increase) in 2011. Ponemon\nalso calculated that each organization averages 102 successful cyber attacks per week, up from 72 per week in 2011 (42\npercent increase).\n\nON THE WEB\n\nTo download a free copy of the Ponemon Institute report, connect to www.ponemon.org/library.\n\nCompanies victimized by large-scale data breaches face enormous costs, including:\n\n###### ;; [Investigation and forensics costs]\n ;; [Customer and partner communications costs]\n ;; [Public relations costs]\n ;; [Lost revenue due to damaged reputation]\n ;; [Regulatory fines]\n ;; [Civil claims and legal fees]\n\nWhen it comes to defending against cyber attacks, the old\nadage applies — an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of\ncure. Companies owe it to themselves, their customers, and\ntheir stockholders to incorporate next-generation threat protection into their defense-in-depth architecture to stay ahead\nof today’s new breed of cyber attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Today’s Threat Landscape\n\nThere are dozens of cyber attacks facing today’s enterprises\nand government agencies. I’m going to oversimplify the threat\nlandscape by grouping cyber attacks into two broad categories — traditional threats and next-generation threats.\n\n###### Traditional threats\n\nThe traditional cyber attacks described in this section are\n“oldies but goodies.” But don’t underestimate them. Although\nthey can usually be detected by IPS devices, next-generation\nfirewalls (NGFW), and anti-virus software, sometimes newer\nvariants slip through the cracks.\n\n###### Worms, Trojans, and viruses\n\nA computer worm is a stand-alone malware program that\nreplicates itself — typically through vulnerabilities in operating systems — over a network in order to propagate. Worms\ntypically harm networks by consuming bandwidth, but also\nprovide a “lateral” attack vector that may infect supposedly\nprotected internal systems or exfiltrate data. Unlike a computer virus, a worm doesn’t append itself to other programs\nor files.\n\nA Trojan (or Trojan horse) typically masquerades as a helpful\nsoftware application, with the ultimate purpose of tricking\na user into granting access to a computer. Trojans may selfreplicate within the infected system, but cannot propagate to\nother vulnerable computers on their own; they typically join\nnetworks of other infected computers (called botnets; see\nnext section) where they wait to receive further instructions,\nand into which they submit stolen information. Trojans may\nbe delivered by means of spam email or social media, or may\nbe disguised as a pirated installer for a well-known game\nor application.\n\nA computer virus is malicious code ranging in severity from\nmildly annoying to completely devastating. It attaches itself\nto a program or file enabling it to spread from one computer\nto another, leaving infections as it travels. However, unlike a\nworm, a virus can’t travel without human action.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Spyware and botnets\n\n_Spyware is software that covertly gathers user information_\nthrough an Internet connection without the user’s knowledge,\nusually for advertising purposes (called Adware, which\ndisplays pop-up ads), but sometimes to steal confidential\ninformation such as usernames, passwords, and credit card\nnumbers. Spyware applications are typically bundled as a\nhidden component of shareware or freeware programs downloaded from the Internet. Once installed, the spyware monitors user activity and then covertly transmits that information\nin the background to someone else.\n\nTECH TALK A botnet is a collection of compromised Internet-connected\ncomputers on which malware is running. Each compromised\ndevice is called a bot (or zombie), and the human controlling a\nbotnet is called the bot _herder (or botmaster). Command and_\ncontrol of a botnet typically involves Web servers (called com_mand-and-control or CnC servers) operated for the specific_\npurpose of controlling bots, though some older botnets are\ndirected by the bot herder using Internet Relay Chat (IRC).\nBots are often used to commit denial-of-service attacks, relay\nspam, store stolen data, and/or download additional malware\nto the infected host computer.\n\n###### Social engineering attacks\n\nSocial engineering attacks — such as phishing and baiting\n— are extremely common. As I discuss in Chapter 3, these\nattacks, when successful, can lead to much broader, moresophisticated cyber attacks.\n\n_Phishing is an attempt to acquire information (and, indirectly,_\nmoney) such as usernames, passwords, credit card information, and Social Security numbers by masquerading as a\ntrustworthy entity in email communication. After clicking on\na (seemingly innocent) hyperlink, the user is directed to enter\npersonal details on a fake website that looks and feels almost\nidentical to the legitimate one.\n\nPhishing can be specialized, as follows:\n\n###### ;; Spear phishing targets a specific person or persons\nwithin an organization. Attackers will often gather\npersonal information about their target ahead of\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ;; Whaling is directed specifically toward senior\nexecutives and other high-profile targets within\nan organization.\n\n_Baiting occurs when a criminal casually drops a USB thumb_\ndrive or CD-ROM in a parking lot or cyber café. This drive or\ndisc is labeled with words such as “executive compensation” or\n“company confidential” to pique the interest of whoever finds\nit. When the victim accesses the media, it installs malware on\nhis or her computer.\n\n###### Buffer overflows and SQL injections\n\nTwo commonly used techniques that exploit vulnerabilities\nare buffer overflows and SQL injection attacks.\n\nA buffer overflow is a cyber attack where the hacker writes\nmore data into a memory buffer than the buffer is designed to\nhold. Some of this data spills into adjacent memory, causing\nthe desktop or Web-based application to execute arbitrary\ncode with escalated privileges or even crash. Buffer overflows\nare commonly triggered by hacker inputs or by malicious files/\nWeb objects that are designed to execute code or alter the way\nthat the program operates.\n\nAn SQL injection attacks databases through a website or Webbased application. The attacker submits SQL statements into\na Web form in an attempt to get the Web application to pass\nthe rogue SQL command to the database. A successful SQL\ninjection attack can reveal database content (such as credit\ncard and Social Security numbers, passwords, and more) to\nthe attacker.\n\n###### Next-generation threats\n\nTraditional signature-based security defenses — including\nIPS, NGFW, and anti-virus products — are mainly designed to\ndetect known threats. But today, it’s the unknown threats that\nare making the biggest headlines.\n\nTIP This section details the most dangerous cyber attacks facing\nenterprises and government agencies today. In Chapter 2, I\ndescribe why traditional security defenses are inadequate for\ndetecting and preventing them.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Zero-day threats\n\nA zero-day threat is a cyber attack on a publicly unknown\noperating system or application vulnerability, so named\nbecause the attack was launched on (or increasingly before)\n“day zero” of public awareness of the vulnerability — and, in\nmany instances, before the vendor was even aware. (Although\nin some instances, the vendor is already aware of the vulnerability, but hasn’t disclosed it publicly because the vulnerability hasn’t yet been patched.)\n\nDON’T FORGET Zero-day attacks are extremely effective because they can go\nundetected for long periods (usually several months but sometimes a couple of years), and when they are finally identified\n“in the wild,” patching the vulnerability still takes days or\neven weeks.\n\n###### Advanced persistent threats\n\n_Advanced persistent threats (APTs) (also known as advanced_\n_targeted attacks, or ATAs) are sophisticated network attacks_\nin which an unauthorized person gains access to a network\nand stays undetected for a long period of time. The intention\nof an APT is to steal data rather than to cause damage to the\nnetwork. APTs target organizations in sectors with high-value\ninformation, such as credit card processors, government agencies, and the financial services industry.\n\nAPTs often use spear phishing (see prior “Phishing and baiting attacks” section) for gaining initial network entry. Once an\ninitial host has been compromised, the APT proceeds using a\n_slow-and-low strategy to evade detection._\n\nTIP Chapter 3 is dedicated to the topic of APTs and describes how\nsophisticated cybercriminals have used slow-and-low tactics\nin some of the largest data breaches on record.\n\nAlthough I’ve proposed a definition for APT in this book, definitions across the information security industry vary. Some\nsay APTs are only committed by nation-states (such as China\nand Russia) for political motivations, reserving the term ATA\nfor financially motivated attacks. Others use the term to define\nany “sophisticated” cyber attack, regardless of methodology.\nHowever, I believe my definition depicts the majority view of\ninformation security professionals\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Polymorphic threats\n\nA polymorphic threat is a cyber attack — such as a virus,\nworm, spyware, or Trojan — that constantly changes\n(“morphs”), making it nearly impossible to detect using\nsignature-based defenses. Evolution of polymorphic threats\ncan occur in a variety of ways, such as filename changes and\ncompression (file size).\n\nAlthough the appearance of the code within a polymorphic\nthreat changes with each “mutation,” the essential function\nusually remains the same. For example, a spyware program\nintended to act as a keylogger (unauthorized malware that\nrecords keystrokes) will continue to perform that function\neven though its signature has changed.\n\nThe evolution of polymorphic threats has made the jobs\nof IT security professionals much more difficult. Vendors\nthat manufacture signature-based security products must\nconstantly create and distribute new threat signatures (a very\nexpensive and time-consuming proposition, I might add),\nwhile enterprises and government agencies — often with\nthousands of hosts (especially Microsoft Windows hosts; see\n“Why Windows is so prone to cyber attacks” sidebar) to protect — are constantly deploying the signatures their security\nvendors produce. It’s a vicious cycle, that is always well behind\nthe cybercriminals, with no end in sight.\n\n###### Blended threats\n\nA blended threat is a cyber attack that combines elements\nof multiple types of malware and usually employs multiple\nattack vectors (varying paths and targets of attack) to increase\nthe severity of damage and the speed of contagion. Nimda,\nCodeRed, and Conficker are a few well-known examples of\nblended threats.\n\nA blended threat typically includes:\n\n###### ;; [Multiple means of propagation]\n ;; [Exploitation of operating system and/or appli-]\n\ncation vulnerabilities\n###### ;; [The intent to cause harm to network hosts]\n\n\n-----\n\nCAUTION Blended threats are widely considered by information security\nprofessionals to be the worst risk to network security since the\ninception of viruses, as most blended threats require no\nhuman intervention to propagate.\n\n\n###### Why Windows is so prone\n to cyber attacks\n\n\nWhen you read about high-profile\ndata breaches in the trade press\n— at least those committed by\nInternet-borne threats, rather than\ninvolving physically stolen laptops\nor USB thumb drives — virtually all\nof them result from a cyber attack\nagainst a Microsoft Windows host.\n\nSo, does that mean that Windows\nhosts are more prone to cyber\nattacks? IT security pundits\nthink so and generally offer two\nexplanations — both of which I\ndeem as perfectly valid.\n\nThe first explanation merely relates\nto the near-monopolistic desktop\noperating system market share\nthat Microsoft enjoys, especially in\nbusiness environments. Although\nanalyst estimations vary, most\nshow that approximately 9 out of\n10 end-user computing devices\nfeature a Windows operating\nsystem. Thus, when sophisticated\nhackers are developing complex\nworms, Trojans, botnets, and\nspear-phishing attacks, Windows is\nclearly the target of choice.\n\nThe second explanation has more\nof a “technical” slant. Windows,\nas well as Microsoft DOS before\nit, was designed to be a singleuser operating system — frankly,\nwith security as an afterthought.\nIn other words, Windows was\n\n\ndesigned to let the user have free\nrein over the entire operating\nsystem. However, years later\n— starting with Windows NT\n— Windows was modified to\nsupport multiple user logins.\nBut rather than re-architecting\nWindows from scratch as a multiuser operating system, Microsoft\nchose to preserve compatibility\nwith programs designed for older\nWindows versions.\n\nIn doing so, Microsoft left Windows\nfull of holes (vulnerabilities) for\nhackers to exploit. So many, in\nfact, that the second Tuesday of\nevery month is known as “Patch\nTuesday,” when Microsoft releases\nnew patches (through Microsoft\nsecurity bulletins) mainly to\naddress vulnerabilities within\nWindows operating systems.\nAlthough Patch Tuesday began\nin 2004, it’s still in full operation\ntoday.\n\nDoes this mean that non-Windows\noperating systems are completely\nsafe from viruses, malware, and\nother cyber attacks? Of course,\nnot. But since Mac OS X and Linux\nwere designed from the ground\nup with security in mind, these\nplatforms are far less susceptible.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Chapter 2\n\n### Understanding the Enemy\n\n###### In this chapter\n\n •• Categorize three kinds of cyber enemies\n •• Learn how attackers bypass traditional security defenses\n\n_“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not_\n_fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself_\n_but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also_\n_suffer a defeat.”_\n\n— Sun Tzu, The Art of War\n\nnow thy enemy,” an important theme from Sun Tzu’s\ninfamous The Art of War manuscript, certainly ties\n\n# “K\n\nnicely to the war against cyber attacks (and now, cyber ter_rorism) today. Before we dive into the anatomy of advanced_\npersistent threats (in Chapter 3) and how to defend against\nthem (in Chapter 4), let’s spend a little time getting to know\nthe enemies, including understanding their motivations and\nwhy they are successful.\n\n###### Who is the Enemy?\n\nThe face of cyber attackers has changed dramatically with\nthe passing of each decade. In the 1970s and 1980s, phone\nphreaking (unauthorized manipulation of telephone switching\nequipment primarily to place free long-distance phone calls)\nwas the craze. In 1983, the movie WarGames, starring a young\nMatthew Broderick, introduced the general public to computer\nhacking by way of modem, and the legend of hackers as cyber\nheroes was born.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe 1990s brought widespread Internet adoption, including\nthe emergence of the World Wide Web. Hackers back then\ndefaced public websites primarily for bragging rights — up\nuntil the turn of the century.\n\nDON’T FORGET Hacking has now transformed into a multi-billion-dollar\nindustry. Long gone are the days of hacking just for kicks.\nToday, there are essentially three types of cyber attackers that\nenterprises and government agencies must contend with—\ncybercriminals, state-sponsored threat actors, and hacktivists.\n\n###### Cybercriminals\n\nSimply put, cybercriminals are individuals who hack for profit.\nIn most instances, they break into company networks in an\nattempt to steal credit card numbers (sometimes numbering\nin the tens or even hundreds of thousands) and sell them on\nthe open market. Although not quite as profitable, Facebook,\nTwitter, and email account credentials sell for a pretty\npenny, too.\n\nOne of the most notorious cybercriminals ever convicted is\nAlbert Gonzalez. In 2010, Gonzalez was convicted of hacking\ninto the databases of a regional credit card payment processing company, stealing more than 170 million credit card numbers over two years. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison\n— the stiffest sentence imposed on a cybercriminal to date.\n\n###### State-sponsored threat actors\n\nArguably the most notable shift in the hacking community\nwithin the last decade has been the emergence of statesponsored threat actors. These are individuals employed\nby a government (not necessarily their own government) to\npenetrate commercial and/or government computer systems\nin other countries to compromise data, sabotage computer\nsystems, or even commit cyber warfare.\n\nChina and Russia are among the countries most often cited\nfor recruiting state-sponsored threat actors. But they are\nnot alone. The following are well-known examples of cyber\nattacks allegedly perpetrated by nation-states, including the\nUnited States:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ;; [Iran is accused of cyber attacks against U.S. banks ]\n\nand oil companies in Saudi Arabia and Qatar (2012).\n###### ;; [The United States and Israel are accused of creating ]\n\nFlame malware targeting Iran, Syria, and others\n(2012).\n###### ;; [China cracks RSA SecurID tokens (2011).]\n\n\n###### ;; [The United States and Israel are accused of launching ]\n\nthe Stuxnet worm targeting a uranium enrichment\nfacility in Iran (2010).\n###### ;; [China attacks Google (dubbed “Operation Aurora”) ]\n\nto access Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights\nactivists; the same attack targets Adobe, Juniper,\nDow Chemical, Northrop Grumman, and others\n(2009).\n###### ;; [China steals blueprints for America’s new joint strike ]\n\nfighter planes, the F-35 and F-22 (2009).\n###### ;; [Russia attacks the websites of Estonia’s parliament, ]\n\nministries, banks, and newspapers amid relocation of\nthe Bronze Soldier of Tallinn memorial (2007).\n\nIran recently launched an ambitious $1 billion governmental\nprogram to boost national cyber capabilities. Experts believe\nthat although China’s and Russia’s cyber war capabilities\nare vastly superior to Iran’s, politically speaking, Iran is\nsignificantly more likely to target U.S. cyber infrastructure\nin light of the ongoing international impasse over Iran’s\nnuclear program.\n\n###### Hacktivists\n\nHacktivism is the use of digital tools in pursuit of political\nends. Unlike cybercriminals who are motivated by money,\nhacktivists are motivated by political ideology. Typical cyber\nattacks committed by hacktivists include website defacements, redirects, information theft, and virtual sit-ins through\ndistributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks (overwhelming\nwebsites through hundreds or thousands of simultaneous and\nrepetitive connections).\n\nSome hacktivists have joined together to collectively target\n\ni ti I 2011 L l S l i d ibilit f l\n\n\n-----\n\nhigh-profile cyber attacks, including multiple attacks against\nSony and the crashing of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency\n(CIA) website. In 2012, Anonymous claimed responsibility for\ncrashing several Israeli government websites following Israel’s\naerial strikes on Gaza.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### How the Enemy Succeeds\n\nNow that you have a solid understanding of the three main\ntypes of cyber attackers — cybercriminals, state-sponsored\nthreat actors, and hacktivists — I’ll discuss why they’re\nso successful.\n\n###### Bypassing signature-based defenses\n\nTraditional network and endpoint security products — such as\nintrusion prevention systems (IPS), next-generation firewalls\n(NGFW), secure Web gateways, and anti-virus solutions —\nrely on pattern-matching signatures (sometimes called\nrules or filters) to detect known cyber attacks and, in some\ninstances, unknown attacks targeting known vulnerabilities.\n\nThese security defenses are extremely effective at detecting\ntraditional, known cyber attacks such as worms, Trojans,\nspyware, botnets, and basic computer viruses. But as I\ndiscuss in Chapter 1, they’re completely inept at detecting\ntoday’s new breed of cyber attacks, such as zero-day, targeted\nattacks, polymorphic malware, blended attacks, and APTs.\nIn fact, in most cases, today’s new breed of cyber attacks pass\nthrough traditional security defenses as if they weren’t even\nthere! That’s simply because no signature exists to detect the\nadvanced tactics used in the first stage of an overall attack that\nultimately gives cyber attackers free rein within the network.\n\nCAUTION Don’t get me wrong. Traditional signature-based defenses are\ncritical components of a well-balanced defense-in-depth strategy. I’m simply asserting that they’re not enough to defend\nagainst today’s new breed of cyber attacks that cut across\ncommunication channels (e.g., Web and email) and take place\nover multiple stages.\n\n###### Bypassing anomaly-based defenses\n\nBetter IPS and network behavior analysis (NBA) solutions\nincorporate anomaly-based detection methods to help\nuncover sophisticated cyber attacks. They work by aggregating\nflow records (e.g., NetFlow, sFlow, cFlow) from network routers and switches and baselining “normal” network traffic over\nthe course of days or even weeks. Once a baseline has been\n\n\n-----\n\nestablished, network anomalies can be detected, such as a host\nsending exorbitant amounts of data outside the organization\nor an end-user computing device communicating directly with\nother end-user computing devices.\n\nAlthough anomaly-based security defenses can detect\ncertain events caused by next-generation threats, they are\nlargely unsuccessful because they’re frequently prone to\nfalse positives (misclassifying good traffic as bad). And\nthey’re also prone to false negatives (misclassifying bad\ntraffic as good) due to the “slow and low” nature of advanced\npersistent threats.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Chapter 3\n\n### Anatomy of Advanced  Cyber Attacks\n\n###### In this chapter\n\n •• Define, in detail, advanced persistent threats (APTs)\n •• Review high-profile APTs making international headlines\n •• Understand the life cycle of APT attacks\n\nn Chapter 1, I discuss the differences between traditional\ncyber attacks and today’s new breed of cyber attacks. In\n\n# I\n\nChapter 2, I discuss why next-generation threats are so well\nequipped to bypass traditional security defenses. Now I’d\nlike to discuss the category of advanced cyber attacks that is,\nby far, generating the most headlines. I’m talking, of course,\nabout advanced persistent threats, or APTs.\n\nIn this chapter, I expand upon the definition of APT provided in Chapter 1. I detail some of the biggest headlines\nAPTs have generated in recent years and then discuss their\ndamaging impact on victimized enterprises and government\nagencies. I conclude the chapter by describing the APT\nattack life cycle and provide a list of telltale signs to help you\ndetermine whether your network has been compromised by\nan APT attack.\n\n###### APTs in Depth\n\nIn Chapter 1, I define an APT as “a sophisticated network\nattack in which an unauthorized person gains access to a\nnetwork and stays undetected for a long period of time.”\nAlthough this is quite true it’s only part of the story APTs are\n\n\n-----\n\nThe term “advanced persistent threat” was actually created by\ninformation security analysts in the U.S. Air Force in 2006. It\ndescribes three aspects of the attackers, including their profile,\nintent, and structure:\n\n\n###### ;; [Advanced:][ The attacker is an expert in cyber-]\n\nintrusion methods and is capable of crafting custom\nexploits and tools.\n###### ;; [Persistent:][ The attacker has a long-term objective ]\n\nand will persistently work to achieve it without detection and without regard for time.\n###### ;; [Threat:][ The attacker is organized, funded, well ]\n\ntrained, and highly motivated.\n\nDON’T FORGET APTs are widely considered the most dangerous type of cyber\nattack today. Cybercriminals who employ APTs are a different\nbreed. They’re experts at “flying below the radar” to avoid\ndetection as they exfiltrate highly sensitive data from enterprises and government agencies.\n\nUnfortunately, most organizations don’t know they’ve been\ncompromised by an APT attack until it’s too late. According\nto the same 2012 Verizon Data Breach Investigations report\nreferenced in Chapter 1, 59 percent of surveyed organizations\nthat experienced major data breaches in 2011 were notified of\nthe breach by a law enforcement agency!\n\n###### What APTs are not\n\nAs important as it is to understand what APTs are, it’s equally\nimportant to understand what they are not. An APT is not a\nsingle piece of malware, or even a collection of malware. It is\nnot a single activity and it is never launched without a specific\ntarget or objective in mind.\n\nAPTs are well coordinated, extended campaigns — whether\nmotivated by financial gain, personal politics, or national\ninterests — intended to achieve an objective against a specific\ntarget. As you’ll soon discover (see the “APT Attack Life Cycle”\nsection later in this chapter), APTs incorporate multiple cyber\nattack techniques and take place over several stages to form a\nsingle coordinated attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APTs in the News\n\nThese days, it seems like a week can’t go by without news of\na major data breach at a company, university, or government\nagency. The following are descriptions of the most newsworthy APT attacks in each of the last four years.\n\n\n-----\n\nON THE WEB To stay on top of major data breaches affecting commercial\nand government organizations, I highly recommend the SC\n_Magazine Data Breach Blog at www.scmagazine.com/the-_\ndata-breach-blog/section/1263/.\n\n###### Flame (2012)\n\nFlame, also known as Flamer, sKyWiper, and Skywiper,\nis an APT that was identified in May 2012 by the MAHER\nCenter of Iranian National CERT, Kaspersky Lab, and\nthe Budapest University of Technology and Economics.\nKaspersky Lab was asked by the United Nations International\nTelecommunications Union to investigate reports of a virus\naffecting Iranian Oil Ministry computers.\n\nComputer experts consider Flame the cause of an attack in\nApril 2012 that caused Iranian officials to disconnect their oil\nterminals from the Internet. It is now widely asserted that the\nUnited States and Israel jointly developed the Flame malware\nto collect intelligence in preparation for cyber-sabotage aimed\nat slowing Iran’s ability to develop a nuclear weapon.\n\nAfter the initial exploit stage, Flame begins a complex set of\noperations including calling back to its command-and-control\nservers to download other malware modules. When fully\ndeployed, Flame is an uncharacteristically large program\nfor malware at 20 megabytes in size — about 20 to 30 times\nlarger than a typical computer virus. It is widely regarded\nas the most sophisticated malware ever created. Experts\nbelieve Flame, which was designed to masquerade as a\nroutine Microsoft software update, was created to secretly\nmap and monitor Iran’s computer networks, sending\nback a steady stream of intelligence to prepare for a cyber\nwarfare campaign.\n\n###### RSA SecurID Attack (2011)\n\nIn March 2011, RSA Security (a division of EMC) disclosed\nthat it had been victimized by an APT, causing it to notify\nits SecurID two-factor authentication customers and advise\nthem to swap out their (compromised) token devices. In the\nmonths following, reports of data breaches caused, in part, by\ncompromised SecurID tokens began to surface. Most notably,\nLockheed Martin released a statement admitting that its\n\n\n-----\n\ncompany said no assets were compromised. Some security\nexperts, however, are skeptical as to whether the nation’s\nlargest defense contract is being completely forthcoming\nabout a breach on which President Obama was reportedly\npersonally briefed.\n\nON THE WEB Soon after RSA Security disclosed the attack to the public, a\ncompany official posted a blog providing intricate details\nabout how the APT attack was perpetrated over several stages.\nTo learn more, read the “RSA Security steps forward to\ndescribe its APT attack” sidebar later in this chapter.\n\nIn EMC’s 10-Q filing, it was disclosed that the APT attack\nagainst RSA Security cost the company $81.3 million to\nreplace SecurID tokens, monitor customers, harden internal\nsystems, and handle fallout from the security breach.\n\n###### Stuxnet (2010)\n\n_Stuxnet is a highly sophisticated computer worm discovered_\nin June 2010 that was believed to be in place for over a year\nand used in conjunction with an APT attack against Iranian\nuranium enrichment infrastructure. In the first stage, Stuxnet\ninitially spread by exploiting a Microsoft Windows vulnerability and then spread laterally in the network to ultimately reach\ntargeted Siemens industrial software and equipment causing\nit to malfunction. Although this is not the first time that hackers have targeted industrial systems, it is the first documented\ncase of malware to include a programmable logic controller\n(PLC) rootkit.\n\nSiemens stated that the worm has not caused any damage to\nits customers, but the Iran nuclear facility procured embargoed Siemens equipment secretly, which was damaged by\nStuxnet during the attack. Interestingly, Stuxnet’s multiple\nspreading mechanisms caused it to eventually escape from the\nIranian facility and to infect energy giant Chevron. However,\ncompany officials said that Stuxnet identified Chevron as an\ninnocent target and was programmed to withhold its damaging payload, thus ending the attack life cycle. As a result, it\ncaused no damage to Chevron’s systems and the company was\nable to remove it.\n\nExperts have found evidence within the Stuxnet source\n\n\n-----\n\nIsrael, although officials from both countries have denied\nthe accusation.\n\n###### Operation Aurora (2009)\n\nOperation Aurora was a high-profile APT attack that began\nin mid-2009 and continued through December 2009. It was\nfirst publicly disclosed by Google in January 2010 in a blog\npost indicating that the attack originated from China and that\nit targeted the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. Dozens more organizations, including Yahoo, Symantec,\nNorthrop Grumman, Morgan Stanley, and Dow Chemical,\nwere also targeted by this attack.\n\nTwo days following the attack, McAfee reported the attackers\nhad exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft Internet\nExplorer and dubbed the attack “Operation Aurora.” Once a\nvictim’s system was compromised, the next stage of the attack\nconsisted of a backdoor connection that masqueraded as an\nSSL connection to command-and-control servers running\nin Illinois, Texas, and Taiwan, including machines that were\nrunning under stolen Rackspace customer accounts. The\nvictim’s machine then began its lateral search for sources\nof intellectual property, specifically the contents of source\ncode repositories.\n\n###### The Ripple Effect of a  National APT Attack\n\nIn Chapter 1 (in “The Cost of Failure” section), I itemize common costs that companies face when subjected to a large-scale\ndata breach, including forensics costs, regulatory fines, and\nlost revenue. But what if APT threat actors decided to target\nsomething a little more strategic than corporate data?\n\nImagine, if you will, a coordinated APT attack against power\ncompanies in a large region of the United States — say, the\nNortheast. Let’s further imagine that the perpetrators of the\nattack were successful in compromising the SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) systems that control a\nmulti-state power grid, knocking out power for days or even\nweeks. Can you imagine the “ripple effect” such an attack\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ;; [Electric power grids crash]\n ;; [Gas stations can’t pump fuel]\n ;; [ATMs can’t dispense cash]\n ;; [Grocery stores are depleted]\n ;; [Hospitals and emergency services can’t keep up]\n\nThink such an attack is impossible? Think again. According\nto a 2012 report titled “Terrorism and the Electric Power\nDelivery System” from the National Research Council, a\nsuccessful cyber attack on a regional power grid would make\nHurricane Sandy look like nothing. Internet-delivered malware designed to destroy control systems could black out large\nregions of the nation for weeks or months causing widespread\ncivil unrest. According to the report, damage from such an\nattack would cost many billions of dollars more than the\ndestruction caused by Hurricane Sandy against the East Coast\nin 2012.\nON THE WEB\n\nTo access the National Research Council report, connect to\nwww.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12050\n\n###### APT Attack Life Cycle\n\nThe anatomy of advanced persistent threats varies just as\nwidely as the victims they target. However, cybersecurity\nexperts researching APTs over the past five years have\nunveiled a fairly consistent attack life cycle consisting of five\ndistinct stages:\n\n###### ;; [Stage 1:][ Initial intrusion through system ]\n\nexploitation\n###### ;; [Stage 2:][ Malware is installed on compromised ]\n\nsystem\n###### ;; [Stage 3:][ Outbound connection is initiated]\n\n\n###### ;; [Stage 4:][ Attacker spreads laterally]\n ;; [Stage 5:][ Compromised data is extracted]\n\n\n-----\n\nLet’s now explore each of these five APT life cycle stages in\nmore detail.\n\n###### Stage 1: Initial intrusion through system exploitation\n\nSystem exploitation is the first stage of an APT attack to\ncompromise a system in the targeted organization. By successfully detecting when a system exploitation attempt is\nunderway, identification and mitigation of the APT attack is\nmuch more straightforward. If your defenses cannot detect the\ninitial system exploitation, mitigating the APT attack becomes\nmore complicated because the attacker has now successfully\ncompromised the endpoint, can disrupt endpoint security\nmeasures, and hide his actions as malware spreads within the\nnetwork and calls back out of the network.\n\nSystem exploits are typically delivered through the Web\n(remote exploit) or through email (local exploit) as an attachment. The exploit code is embedded within a Web object (e.g.,\nJavaScript, JPG) or file (e.g., XLS, PDF) to compromise the\nvulnerable OS or application enabling an attacker to run code,\nsuch as connect-back shellcode to call back to CnC servers and\ndownload more malware.\n\nIn the attack against RSA Security in 2011, an employee\nwas tricked into opening an email with the subject of “2011\nRecruitment plan.xls,” which included a malicious Microsoft\nExcel spreadsheet attachment that successfully exploited the\nsystem using a zero-day Adobe Flash vulnerability. (For more\ndetails, read the sidebar titled “RSA Security steps forward to\ndescribe its APT attack” later in this chapter.)\n\nTECH TALK System exploit code is developed by attackers to corrupt memory or cause a buffer overflow condition within the vulnerable\nOS or application enabling arbitrary code execution. In the\ncase of local exploits, oftentimes social engineering is used to\ninitiate the necessary user interaction needed to complete the\ninfection. In the case of remote exploits, such as Web drive-by\ndownloads, no user interaction is required beyond visiting the\nWeb page.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Stage 2: Malware is installed on compromised system\n\nOnce a victim system is exploited, arbitrary code is executed\nenabling malware to be installed on the compromised system.\nVisiting a Web page or a simple double-click of the mouse is\nall it takes for the user’s system to become compromised and\ninfected with the malware payload.\n\nTECH TALK Not all spear phishing emails originating from an APT threat\nactor contain attachments. Many contain hyperlinks that, when\nclicked on by the user, open a Web browser (or sometimes\nanother application, such as Adobe Reader, Microsoft Word, or\nMicrosoft Excel). Each link is then redirected to a hidden\naddress with a base64-encoding key. The hidden address refers\nto a dropsite, which assesses the browser for known vulnerabilities and returns a Trojan downloader. Upon execution, the\ndownloader conveys a base64-encoded instruction to a different dropsite from which a Trojan (malware) is delivered.\n\n###### Stage 3: Outbound connection is initiated\n\nThe malware installed during the prior stage often contains\na remote administration tool, or RAT. Once up and running,\nthe RAT “phones home” by initiating an outbound connection,\noften an SSL-encrypted channel, between the infected computer and a CnC server operated by the APT threat actor. APT\nthreat actors go to this trouble to establish outbound callbacks\nto bypass traditional and next-generation firewalls, which\nallow session traffic to flow bi-directionally if initiated from\nwithin the trusted network.\n\nOnce the RAT has successfully connected to the CnC server,\nthe attacker has full control over the compromised host.\nFuture instructions from the attacker are conveyed to the RAT\nthrough one of two means — either the CnC server connects to\nthe RAT or vice versa. The latter is usually preferred as a host\ninitiating an external connection from within the network is\nfar less suspicious.\n\n###### Stage 4: Attacker spreads laterally\n\nIt’s highly unlikely that the initially breached end-user\n\n\n-----\n\nmust spread laterally through the network to search for hosts\noperated by IT administrators (in an effort to steal administrative credentials) and high-value servers and databases\ncontaining sensitive data — the ultimate target of the APT\nattack. This is how Flame operated.\n\nTECH TALK Lateral movement does not necessarily involve the use of malware or tools other than those already supplied by the compromised host operating system, such as command shells,\nNetBIOS commands, VNC, Windows Terminal Services, or\nother similar tools used by network administrators to service\nremote hosts. Once the ultimate target has been identified and\nadequate logon credentials are possessed, the attacker’s hard\nwork and determination begin to pay off.\n\n###### Stage 5: Compromised data is extracted\n\nIn this stage of the network breach, the APT attacker has three\nobstacles to contend with. First, transferring all of the target\ndata at once (targeted data is often quantified in gigabytes)\ncould trigger a flow-based anomaly alert (if NBA technology\nis used; see Chapter 2) due to an unusually high volume of\ntraffic initiated by the targeted server or database. Second, the\nattacker needs to ensure that the host receiving the data can’t\nbe linked back to him (or her). And third, transferring data as\nplain text could trigger an alert from a data leakage prevention (DLP) system. Let’s explore how experienced APT threat\nactors overcome all three obstacles.\n\nTo overcome the first obstacle, a savvy APT attacker will\nexfiltrate data from the target server or database in “chunks”\n— perhaps in increments of 50-100 megabytes. One strategy is\nto group files or records together into compressed, passwordprotected RAR files.\n\nTECH TALK Some RAR files can be parts of multi-volume sequences,\nenabling the attacker to split a large quantity of data into volumes. Each RAR file would have an extension to depict the\nnumber of the volume, such as part1.rar (the first volume),\npart2.rar, part3.rar, and so on.\n\nThe second obstacle is a little more challenging. The attacker\nwants to get the data offsite as soon as possible but can’t risk\n\n\n-----\n\novercome this challenge, the attacker might select for a staging area a virtual host that is hosted by a cloud-based service\nprovider. That way the host can be instantly destroyed after\nthe data has been extracted.\n\nThe third and final obstacle in this phase can be accomplished\nby encrypting each RAR file before it is transferred (often via\nFTP) to the staging host. Most RAR files support strong AES\n128-bit encryption, which is more than sufficient.\n\n###### Attacker covers his tracks, remaining undetected\n\nDON’T FORGET If an enterprise or government agency has any hope of detecting an APT on its own, it’s far more likely to happen while the\nattack is still in progress. This is because most APT attackers\nare extremely good at covering their tracks.\n\nThe following are tactics that APT attackers employ during\nand after the attack to minimize the risk of detection:\n\n###### ;; [Planting malware to distract the IT security staff and ]\n\nkeep them busy doing other things.\n###### ;; [Spreading to network file shares, which are relatively ]\n\nunprotected and only completely wiped in extreme\ncircumstances.\n###### ;; [Deleting the compressed files after they’ve been ]\n\nextracted from the staging server.\n###### ;; [Deleting the staging server if it’s hosted in the cloud ]\n\nor taking it offline if under control by the attacker.\n###### ;; [Uninstalling malware at the initial point of entry.]\n\n\n-----\n\n###### RSA Security steps forward \n to describe its APT attack\n\n\nFollowing RSA Security’s March\n2011 data breach (described\nearlier in this chapter; See “APTs in\nthe News” section), the company\nposted details in its corporate blog\ndescribing exactly how the attack\noccurred.\n\nAccording to a company official,\nthe attack started with a spear\nphishing attack that targeted\nspecific company employees\npossibly identified through social\nmedia sites. In this case, the\nattacker sent two different spear\nphishing emails over a two-day\nperiod to two small groups of\nemployees with a subject of\n“2011 Recruitment plan.xls” and\na Microsoft Excel spreadsheet\nattachment.\n\nThe email was crafted well enough\nto trick one of the employees into\nretrieving the email from their\njunk mail (spam) folder and then\ndouble-clicking on the attached\nExcel file. Unbeknownst to the\nuser, the spreadsheet contained\na zero-day exploit that installed\na RAT through an Adobe Flash\nvulnerability. Once the RAT was\nin place, it initiated an outbound\nconnection and the attacker gained\nfull control of the user’s machine.\n\nAs the initially compromised PC\nwas not a strategic asset, the\nattacker’s next tactic was to move\nlaterally inside the network by\ncompromising additional hosts. He\nfirst harvested access credentials\nfrom the first compromised PC,\nincluding credentials to a domain\nadmin account The attacker then\n\n\nperformed privilege account\nescalation on non-administrative\nusers on other systems. He\nrepeated this process until he\nstumbled across a high-value\ntarget — a computer operated by\nan IT server administrator.\n\nSoon after, the attacker located\nhighly sensitive servers (allegedly\ncontaining top-secret SecurID\nt wo -fa c to r a u t h e nt i cat i o n\nalgorithms), compromised them,\nand established access to staging\nservers at key aggregation points to\nget ready for extraction. Then the\nattacker went into the servers of\ninterest, removed data, and moved\nit to the staging servers where the\ndata was aggregated, compressed,\nand encrypted for extraction.\n\nFinally, the attacker used FTP to\ntransfer many password-protected\nRAR files from the RSA file server\nto an outside staging server at an\nexternal, compromised machine\nat a hosting provider. The files\nwere subsequently pulled by the\nattacker and removed from the\nexternal compromised host to\nremove any traces of the attack.\n\nOn a personal note, I applaud RSA\nSecurity for coming forward with\nprecise details of this APT attack.\nBy learning these intricate details,\norganizations can gain insights\nfrom RSA’s misfortune and perhaps\nimplement new strategies and\ntechnologies — including nextgeneration threat protection (see\nChapter 4) — to help mitigate the\nreal risk of APT attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Telltale Signs of an APT Attack\n\nAlthough APTs are extremely difficult to detect, the following\nis a list of common telltale signs that your organization may\nhave been compromised by an APT.\n\n###### ;; [Finding system exploit code embedded in email ]\n\nattachments or delivered via Web pages.\n###### ;; [Increase in elevated logons late at night.]\n ;; [Outbound connections to known CnC servers.]\n\n\n###### ;; [Finding widespread backdoor Trojans on endpoints ]\n\nand/or network file shares.\n###### ;; [Large, unexpected flows of data from within the net-]\n\nwork — from server to server, server to client, client\nto server, or network to network.\n###### ;; [Discovering large (I’m talking gigabytes, not mega-]\n\nbytes) chunks of data appearing in places where that\ndata should not exist.\n\nCAUTION\n\nBe especially wary if you find compressed data in formats not\nnormally used by your organization.\n\n###### ;; Abnormal SSL-encrypted network communications.\n ;; Windows Application Event Log entries of anti-virus\nand firewall stop and restart commands.\n\nTIP A major reason why organizations fail to identify APT attacks\nis because their security devices are only (or mainly) configured to examine inbound traffic at the perimeter. Acquiring\nand/or configuring security solutions to inspect outbound\ntraffic significantly improve your chances of detecting APTs\nand other cyber attacks.\n\nI hope you never have to face cleaning up from an APT attack.\nIf you do, it will be one of the most challenging things you’ve\never had to do in your information security career. Prevention\nand early detection — through the use of next-generation\nthreat prevention technology — is the best way to minimize\nthe potential of being victimized by an APT attack.

In a never-ending\ngame of cat and mouse, the cat currently has the upper hand.\nAnd unless your organization is prepared, you may be its\nnext victim.\n\nIn prior chapters, I hope you’ve gained an appreciation for\nhow serious today’s next-generation threats are and why\ntraditional security defenses are helpless to stop them. Now\nit’s time to unveil a new category of network security defense\n— which up until just recently didn’t even exist. I’m talking, of\ncourse, about next-generation threat protection.\n\nI begin this chapter by discussing — almost daydreaming\nabout — what’s really needed to combat today’s most sophisticated cyber attacks. Then I segue into next-generation threat\nprotection, starting out with a definition followed by details of\n\n\n-----\n\nWe’ve got a lot of ground to cover in this chapter. Let’s start by\ndiscussing what the world really needs to stay ahead of nextgeneration threats.\n\n###### What the World Really Needs\n\nIn a perfect world, there would be no cyber attacks. There\nwould be no such things as malware, Trojans, or APTs. And\nbusinesses, universities, and government agencies wouldn’t\nneed to spend over $20 billion per year to stop them.\n\nUnfortunately, we don’t live in a perfect world. Money and\npolitics are fueling cybercriminals, hacktivists, and statesponsored threat actors to use every tool at their disposal to\nbreak into your organization’s network. Since we don’t live in\na perfect world, let’s talk about what the world needs to stay\nahead of the bad guys.\n\n###### Signature-less defenses\n\nOrganizations today need to explore a new threat protection model in which their defense-in-depth architecture\nincorporates a signature-less layer that specifically addresses\ntoday’s new breed of cyber attacks.\n\nAlthough traditional security defenses are critical for blocking known cyber attacks, experience has shown that it’s the\nunknown cyber attacks that are most worrisome, and on the\nrise. And since these zero-day, polymorphic, and APTs are\nlargely unknown and becoming the new norm for successful breaches, the world needs a signature-less solution to\nstop them.\n\n###### Protection — not just detection\n\nBefore there were intrusion prevention systems (IPS), there\nwere intrusion detection systems (IDS). An IDS, by design,\ncan only detect known threats (or unknown threats targeting\nknown vulnerabilities). As time progressed, organizations\ndemanded that their IDS not only detect but also block cyber\nattacks. Thus, IPS was born.\n\nIn that vein, the world needs an advanced threat protection\nplatform that not only detects the needle in the haystack but\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Multi-stage protection architecture\n\nIn a perfect world, IT would maintain full control of every\ncomputing device on the network. Then you’d only have to\nworry about cyber attacks originating from outside the network and attempting to penetrate it through the perimeter.\n\nOf course, with mobile computing on the rise and IT being\ncompelled to implement bring your own device (BYOD) policies, sometimes cyber attacks are hand-carried right through\nthe office front door. What the world needs is an advanced\nthreat protection solution that not only monitors cyber attacks\nfrom the outside in, but the inside out, as well — across all\nstages as they attempt to call back out or spread laterally\nthrough the network. If you can’t stop threats from entering\nthrough the Web, email, or the office front door, then at least\nstop them from communicating out and spreading further.\n\n###### Highly accurate detection engine\n\nAs with traditional signature-based defenses, detection\naccuracy is king. What the world needs to adequately defend\nagainst next-generation threats is an advanced threat protection solution that is highly accurate, with no false positives\n(good files classified as bad) and no false negatives (bad files\nclassified as good).\n\nCAUTION False positives and false negatives are products of security\nplatforms with poor detection capabilities. False positives are\nmainly a “nuisance” as they consume valuable security analyst\ncycles chasing after false alarms. False negatives, on the other\nhand, can be “company killers” as advanced malware passes\nright through the network security device completely\nundetected.\n\n###### Backed by global threat intelligence\n\nEvery cyber attack has a “ground zero” — a single host that\nis the first target on Earth to ever experience a given cyber\nattack. What the world needs is a mechanism for allowing\nadvanced threat protection systems to share intelligence, not\nonly within a single organization, but also among different\norganizations globally.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe may not live in a perfect world. But there is an ideal solution for combating today’s most sophisticated attacks.\n\nIntroducing next-generation threat protection.\n\n###### Defining Next-Generation  Threat Protection\n\n_Next-generation threat protection (NGTP) is a new breed of_\nnetwork security technology specifically designed to identify\nand defend against today’s new breed of cyber attacks.\nIntended to augment — not replace — traditional security\nsystems, NGTP represents a new layer in the defense-in-depth\narchitecture to form a threat-protection fabric that defends\nagainst those cyber attacks that go unnoticed by common\nsignature-based defenses.\n\nNGTP platforms customarily ship on high-performance,\npurpose-built rackmount appliances. Preferred NGTP vendors\noffer an integrated platform that inspects email traffic, Web\ntraffic, and files at rest, and shares threat intelligence across\nthose attack vectors.\n\nCAUTION NGTP platforms are unlike any network security offering on\nthe market. NGTP appliances inspect traffic and/or files looking for thousands of suspicious characteristics, including\nobfuscation techniques like XOR encoding and other disguising behavior. Sessions are replayed in a (safe) virtual execution environment (think virtual machines, but using a custombuilt virtualization engine specifically designed for security\nanalysis) to determine whether the suspicious traffic actually\ncontains malware (more on this in the “How it Works” section\nlater in this chapter).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Comparison to traditional signature- based defenses\n\nIn Chapter 2 (see the section titled “How the Enemy\nSucceeds”), I describe why and how today’s new breed of\ncyber attacks are able to bypass traditional signature-based i\n\n\n-----\n\n|Protection Comparison|NGTP Solutions|Traditional Defenses|\n|---|---|---|\n|Detect known malware using IPS- style signatures|||\n|Identify attacks within encoded binaries|||\n|Replay suspected traffic in a safe virtual environment|||\n|Inspect outbound traffic to stop dynamic callback channels|||\n|Auto-generate threat intelligence to defend against targeted attacks|||\n\n\nTIP\n\n\nIPS devices, secure email and Web gateways, and anti-virus\nsolutions). But as I hadn’t yet introduced NGTP technology, I\ndidn’t outright compare these defenses to NGTP solutions. I’ll\nremedy that now.\n\nTable 4-1 provides a summary of how traditional signaturebased defenses compare to NGTP solutions. But remember,\nNGTP solutions are a new signature-less layer in your architecture to augment signature-based defenses.\n\n_NGTP_ _Traditional_\n\n_Protection Comparison_ _Solutions_ _Defenses_\n\nDetect known malware using IPSstyle signatures  \n\nIdentify attacks within encoded binaries  \n\nReplay suspected traffic in a safe virtual environment  \n\nInspect outbound traffic to stop dynamic callback channels  \n\nAuto-generate threat intelligence to defend against targeted attacks  \n\n**Table 4-1: Comparison of NGTP to traditional defenses.**\n\nThe protections in Table 4-1 will be explored in detail in the\n“Key Features” section later in this chapter.\n\n###### Comparison to sandbox technologies\n\nA sandbox is essentially a small, self-contained version of a\n(typically Windows-based) computing environment offering\na minimal suite of applications and services. It was originally\ndeveloped for software developers to test new programming\ncode in a safe, non-production environment. Sandboxing technology was later adopted by information security professionals as a way to manually examine suspicious binaries without\ncompromising production systems. The operating system and\napplications contained in the sandbox (virtual machine) typically match the organization’s desktop standard so suspected\nmalware can exploit those same inherent vulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\nCAUTION Organizations with multiple desktop configuration standards\n— as is the case with most large organizations — are particularly at risk when relying on so-called NGTP solutions that\nincorporate rudimentary sandboxing technology. If a malware-infected file is analyzed within a virtual execution environment equipped with operating systems and/or applications that don’t mirror the malware’s target environment,\nthen that file may be classified as good, resulting in a potentially serious false-negative condition.\n\nAs the name implies, a sandbox serves as a safe environment for “exploding” (see “Call the bomb squad!” sidebar\nearlier in this chapter) potential malware and examining its\nintended effects. However, by itself it is not a scalable analysis\ntechnique given the number and volume of suspicious objects\nand file types used to hide exploit code. Also, unfortunately,\ncybercriminals and APT threat actors can detect whether\ntheir malware is being executed in a sandbox environment,\nand if it is, to quell its damaging payload. For these reasons,\ntraditional sandbox technologies are simply no match for\nsophisticated threats.\n\nCAUTION One more word of caution on the subject of sandbox technology. Regardless of what an NGTP vendor calls it, if the sandbox component is hosted by the vendor “in the cloud,” security, performance, and privacy considerations come into play\n(see “Don’t get stuck in the cloud” sidebar). Preferred NGTP\nsolutions offer high-performance, dedicated appliances\nenabling suspected malware to be tested onsite within seconds\n— rather than minutes or hours — while always preserving the\nprivacy of your data.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Key Components\n\nNow that you have a sense for what next-generation threat\nprotection is all about — including how it compares to\ntraditional security defenses and how it differs from ordinary\nsandboxing technology — let’s dive deeper and explore the key\ncomponents of leading NGTP solutions.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Malware protection system\n\nAt the heart of every NGTP solution is the malware protection\nsystem (MPS). This component analyzes suspicious object\ntypes contained in Web traffic, email messages, or files at\nrest. It also blocks known threats using MPS-generated threat\nintelligence to stop inbound threats and unauthorized outbound communications.\n\nCAUTION The tactics of discerning potential malware in Web traffic and\nin email messages are different. Some vendors offer a onesize-fits-all MPS that attempts to detect threats in all three\nmediums (or two, if unable to inspect files at rest). Avoid such\nsuboptimized solutions, as they typically suffer from high\nfalse-positive and false-negative rates. Also, avoid so-called\nNGTP solutions that combine MPS functions with other network security components, such as firewall, IPS, and application control. These solutions typically offer “rudimentary”\ninspection capabilities limited to just .exe, .pdf, and/or .dll files.\n\n###### Virtual execution engine\n\nEarlier in this chapter, I discussed the role of the virtual\nexecution engine and how it compares to ordinary sandbox\ntechnology. I can’t stress enough how critical this component\nis to the efficacy of a next-generation threat protection system\n— and to your organization’s ability to defend against today’s\nadvanced cyber attacks.\n\nCAUTION A good virtual execution engine can programmatically filter\nfor suspicious objects, profile the target victim, and then execute the suspicious code against the intended OS and\napplication(s) to maximize the chances of detonating the system exploit and accompanying malicious payload. Meanwhile,\nit should yield virtually no false positives or false negatives. It\ncan mean the difference between success and failure in the\nwar against today’s new breed of cyber attacks.\n\nTECH TALK Better NGTP offerings contain virtual execution engines\ncapable of inspecting dozens of file types (rather than just .exe\nand .dll files), including: asf, com, doc, docx, dll, exe, gif, ico,\njpeg, jpg, mov, mp3, mp4, pdf, png, ppsx, ppt, pptx, qt, rtf,\nswf, tiff, unk, vcf, xls, xlsx, zip… and the list goes on.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce a suspected threat has been classified as malware by the\nvirtual execution engine, new threat intelligence is automatically created and distributed to your other MPS appliances (if\nyou have a central management system; see next section) and\npossibly to other organizations around the world (see “Cloud\nthreat intelligence network” section just ahead).\n\n###### Central management system\n\nAlthough most NGTP appliances provide a Web-based\ngraphical user interface (GUI) for local administration, better\nNGTP vendors offer both a local GUI and a separate central\nmanagement system appliance for centralized management,\nconsolidated threat monitoring, reporting, alerting, and malware intelligence distribution.\n\n###### Cloud threat intelligence network\n\nEarlier in this chapter, in the “Don’t get stuck in the cloud”\nsidebar, I discussed why performing malware inspection in\nthe cloud is a bad idea for security, scalability, and privacy\nreasons. But the cloud is an ideal place for hosting one key\nNGTP component — the cloud threat intelligence network.\n\nThe cloud threat intelligence network interconnects all MPS\nappliances — at least those from vendors that offer such a\nservice — to share threat intelligence (malware profiles and\ncallback destinations) for newly discovered cyber attacks.\n\nNGTP vendors that offer a cloud threat intelligence network\n(not all of them do) typically give their customers two\noptions — (1) the ability to receive the threat intelligence and\n(2) the ability to share and receive threat intelligence. Most\norganizations choose the latter option as vendors usually offer\na discount for sharing intelligence.\n\nTIP Since only metadata from infectious objects is needed to create threat intelligence, organizations need not worry about the\npotential for sensitive data to leave the network.\n\nNow that you’re grounded in the basic components of an\nNGTP solution and you understand how it differs from traditional signature-based defenses and sandbox technology, turn\nto Chapter 5 to gain deeper insight into how an NGTP solution\n\nll k\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Chapter 5\n\n### Next-Generation Threat  Protection Explored\n\n###### In this chapter\n\n •• Understand how NGTP mitigates next-generation threats in\n email messages, Web communications, and files at rest\n •• Explore the key features found in leading NGTP solutions\n •• Integrate NGTP into your existing network infrastructure\n\nraditional signature-based security defenses are simply\nno match for today’s new breed of cyber attacks, such as\n\n# T\n\nzero-day attacks, polymorphic malware, blended threats, and\nmost importantly, APTs. A new generation of cyber attacks\nrequires an entirely new way of thinking.\n\nNow that you have a sense of what next-generation threat protection is all about (from Chapter 4), let’s roll up our sleeves\nand understand how it works, what features are important,\nand how an NGTP platform can integrate into your existing\nIT infrastructure.\n\n###### How It Works\n\nLet’s start out by describing where to place your MPS appliances in relation to how threats enter the organization.\nTypically, administrators will place MPS appliances as the last\nline of defense to inspect Web and/or email traffic for threats\nthat have bypassed the firewall and IPS. Web MPS appliances\nare placed behind secure Web gateways while email MPS\nappliances should be positioned behind anti-spam and secure\nemail gateways (but in front of the enterprise email server)\n\n\n-----\n\nMPS appliances should also be deployed in the datacenter to\ninspect file shares to stop the lateral spread of malware and\nprotect sensitive data.\n\n**Cloud Service**\n**(email)**\n\n**Internet**\n\n**Anti-Spam**\n**Gateway**\n\n**Mail Servers**\n\n**Egress**\n**Router**\n\n**Firewall**\n\n**Web MPS**\n\n(Check URLs\nfor malicious\ncontent) **CMS**\n\n**Email MPS**\n(Scans email\nattachments\n\n**Core Switch** for APTs)\n\n**Users**\n\n**SIEM**\n\n**Figure 5-1: Typical NGTP implementation diagram.**\n\nDON’T FORGET APT attacks take place over multiple stages. An MPS platform\nshould be designed to protect at every stage, from initial\nexploit to data exfiltration, which maximizes your capability to\ndefuse the attack and prevent a breach.\n\nWith the MPS platform deployed, the following is a step-bystep depiction of how a typical NGTP system functions:\n\n**Step 1: MPS inspects inbound and outbound traffic (and files**\nat rest) looking for known threats, CnC callbacks, spear phishing, and suspicious binaries/Web pages. If a known threat or\nCnC callback is detected, the connection is blocked and an\nalert is triggered.\n\n**Step 2: For unknown, zero-day attack detection, the MPS**\n\n\n**Egress**\n**Router**\n\n**Firewall**\n\n**Web MPS**\n\n(Check URLs\nfor malicious\ncontent) **CMS**\n\n**Core Switch**\n\n**Users**\n\n\n**(email)**\n\n\n**SIEM**\n\n\n-----\n\nreplays it in the virtual execution engine (within the same\nappliance) for analysis. This is a byte-by-byte reconstruction\nof the identical suspicious flow going to the targeted victim.\n\nTIP When evaluating an NGTP solution, be sure its MPS component is capable of inspecting more than just HTTP traffic\nbecause threats use dozens of protocols, such as HTTP, FTP,\nIRC, custom protocols, and more.\n\n**Step 3: Virtual execution engine launches with a specific**\n(patched or unpatched) Microsoft Windows operating system\nand relevant application(s) (e.g., Microsoft Office, Microsoft\nInternet Explorer, Adobe Reader) of the host targeted by the\nsuspected threat. The object is replayed and observed for\nmalicious behavior, including corrupting a root file system,\nattacking an application using a heap spray, registering a new\nWindows service, or calling back to a known infection URL. If\nthe binary is determined to be benign, the event is logged and\nthe virtual machine is reset.\n\n**Step 4: If zero-day malicious activity is confirmed, the virtual**\nmachine captures the rest of the attack life cycle. The malware\nbinary is loaded and all malware-generated host activities and\nnetwork traffic is recorded. Threat intelligence is generated\nto stop associated callback traffic across the network, a highpriority alert is logged, malware forensics are recorded, and\na new malware protection profile is created to block this now\nknown threat.\n\nDON’T FORGET Because the callback traffic never leaves the actual host’s network and the attacker is never notified, the attack has failed\nand sensitive data remains safe in the organization.\n\n**Step 5: The new threat intelligence is forwarded to the**\ncentral management system (CMS) appliance, where it is\ndistributed to other MPS appliances in the organization. If the\norganization has subscribed to the cloud threat intelligence\nnetwork (see Chapter 4), then all participating organizations\nare instantly protected.\n\n###### Inline and out-of-band deployments\n\nOrganizations have two choices for deploying their email\nand Web MPS appliances. They can be configured for inline\n(active) or out-of-band (passive) operation. (File share MPS i\n\n\n-----\n\ninspecting files at rest and can quarantine malicious file share\nobjects, if so configured.)\n\nInline deployments allow an organization to block newly identified advanced cyber attacks from calling back to CnC servers\nto prevent future occurrences of the now known attack. The\ndeployment places the MPS directly in the flow of traffic (just\nlike an IPS or a message transfer agent, or MTA).\n\nMPS appliances can also be configured for out-of-band operation in either monitor-only mode, where the MPS engine\nalerts on detected cyber attacks (just like an IDS), or TCP\n_RESET mode, where the MPS submits TCP RESET packets to_\neach session partner to disrupt nefarious TCP sessions.\n\nTIP For out-of-band operations, connect the Web or email MPS to\na mirrored switch SPAN port. If no SPAN port is available, a\nnetwork TAP (from Gigamon, VSS Monitoring, NetOptics, and\nothers) will suffice (or, configure upstream MTAs to send a\nblind carbon copy to the email MPS).\n\nMany organizations start with out-of-band monitoring to\ngauge the system’s accuracy and stability. Once the organization is comfortable with the NGTP system, the MPS appliances are reconfigured for inline blocking mode.\n\nCAUTION If you intend to install your MPS appliances for inline operation, be sure to select models that support fail-open connectivity. In the (unlikely) event the appliance was to lose power or\notherwise become disabled, traffic would continue to pass\nthrough its copper interfaces, rather than bringing the network to a screeching halt. (Fiber interfaces will always pass\ntraffic, regardless of the appliance’s state.)\n\n###### Key Features\n\nSo now that you know what NGTP is all about and have some\ninsight into how it works, let’s review the key features that\ntypically comprise today’s leading NGTP solutions to address\nevery stage of an APT attack life cycle.\n\nTIP NGTP feature sets vary widely. As you review these features,\ntake note of which ones are particularly applicable to your\norganization. Then refer to Chapter 6 for additional NGTP\nb i id i\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Virtual execution of  suspicious objects\n\nSignature-less analysis to detect unknown threats is critical.\nLook for the ability to replay traffic containing suspicious\nobjects — such as Web pages, binaries, and files — in the\nsafety of a virtual execution environment. This is different\nthan forwarding a suspicious file or executable to a sandbox.\nReplay is the byte-by-byte capture and reconstruction of the\ntraffic flow within a virtual execution environment. A single\nWeb page, for example, is made up of 20 to over 200 different\nobjects served from dozens of different Web locations. Replay\ntechnology is the only way to analyze complex Web-based\nattacks, such as drive-by download attacks.\n\nCAUTION Don’t get trapped into thinking that today’s new breed of\ncyber attacks can only be present in exe or dll files. As I\ntouched on in Chapter 4, malware can be embedded in Web\npages and dozens of file types.\n\nThe ability of the virtual execution engine to minimize the\npotential of false positives and false negatives is imperative.\nA false positive (good file misclassified as bad) could block\nimportant content from reaching its destination. A false\nnegative (bad file misclassified as good) could be devastating\n— especially if a file containing advanced malware pertaining\nto an APT attack is allowed to pass.\n\n###### Fast-path blocking\n\nBlocking outbound callbacks and now known inbound threats\ngoes hand-in-hand with signature-less analysis. Although\nI’ve spent a fair amount of time describing the limitations of\ntraditional signature-based defenses, I’ve also acknowledged\nhow important they are to stop known attacks in a defensein-depth strategy. Look for NGTP solutions that incorporate\nboth signature-based and signature-less techniques to defend\nefficiently against known and unknown attacks, respectively.\n\nHowever, in the event your IPS, NGFW, secure Web gateway,\nanti-spam, or other network security device misses an attack\ncontaining commonly known malware, the fast-path blocking\ncapability of an (inline) MPS appliance is designed to instantly\nbl k i h k\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce advanced malware successfully penetrates the organization (remember, it could be hand-carried into the office on a\nmobile computing device), it attempts to call back to the CnC\nhost to either download RAT software (see Chapter 3) or to\nreceive instructions from the attacker. The MPS appliance is\nequipped to stop sessions connecting to malicious URLs and\nknown-bad IP addresses, or those utilizing custom malware\nprotocols. If the callback filter of the MPS appliance detects\nan attempt by an internal host to connect to a known external\nCnC host, the connection is blocked (assuming the MPS is\nconfigured for inline operation) and an alert is triggered\n(see Figure 5-2.)\n\n**Figure 5-2: Sample FireEye callback activity.**\n\nDON’T FORGET Unlike most traditional security devices, MPS appliances are\ndesigned to inspect both inbound and outbound Internet\ntraffic.\n\n###### Malicious file quarantine\n\nMalicious files, emails, and related attachments detected by\nthe virtual execution engine can be quarantined and stored\non the MPS appliance (or the central management console,\nif available; see next section) for further forensic analysis\nbeyond the forensics provided by the MPS. The files may also\nbe collected as digital evidence by computer crime investigators from the FBI or other law enforcement authorities.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Centralized management\n\nFor organizations with three or more MPS appliances, I highly\nrecommend acquiring a centralized management appliance\n(sometimes called a central management system) to centrally\nmonitor and manage your NGTP system via an easy-to-use\nWeb-based interface. Typical tasks performed using a centralized management console include:\n\n###### ;; [Aggregate event data from all MPS appliances and ]\n\nprocess the data into dashboards, reports, and alerts.\n###### ;; [Centrally aggregate quarantined malicious objects ]\n\nthat contain malware.\n###### ;; [Aggregate and disseminate threat intelligence ]\n\ngenerated by internal MPS appliances and from the\nmalware protection cloud; upload threat intelligence\nto the malware protection cloud, if permitted to do so\n###### ;; [Configure MPS appliance settings and apply them to ]\n\neach MPS appliance individually or in groups.\n###### ;; [Download and apply software updates to all MPS ]\n\nappliances from one central location.\n###### ;; [Monitor the performance of all MPS appliances.]\n\n\n###### ;; [Export event data to SIEMs (security information ]\n\nand event management), incident management\nsystems, or other external applications.\n###### ;; [Control user access and administrative privileges.]\n\nSome NGTP vendors offer multiple centralized management appliance models to choose from, depending on the\nquantity of MPS appliances managed and the volume of cyber\nattack activity.\n\n###### Malware intelligence sharing\n\nPart of the beauty of an NGTP solution is organizations\n(automatically) are protected by their locally generated threat\nintelligence and can choose to share this with other organizations. Through a cloud threat intelligence network (owned\nand operated by the NGTP vendor), once one organization has\ndetected a brand new threat (“ground zero” for the attack), all\nother organizations are protected within minutes Many call\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile organizations can defuse APT attacks with a standalone MPS, collective immunity makes their MPS security\nanalysis more efficient by focusing MPS resources on analyzing truly unknown cyber attacks. Plus, by anonymously\nsharing newly created threat intelligence via the cloud,\norganizations commonly receive a vendor discount on their\nannual cloud threat intelligence network subscriptions for\ntheir willingness to share threat intelligence.\n\nDON’T FORGET It’s important to understand that at no time will any of your\nfiles, or even content contained within those files, ever be sent\nto the cloud threat intelligence network. Threat protection\nprofiles, for example, only include anonymized data, such as a\nchecksum of the file.\n\n###### Custom rule support\n\nLeading NGTP systems enable more-advanced users to import\ncustom malware-detection rules created using the YARA\nrules language. (YARA is a tool designed to help malware\nresearchers identify and classify malware samples.) When\nan imported YARA rule is triggered by the MPS, the virtual\nexecution engine immediately analyzes associated objects for\npotential cyber attacks. This is helpful for organizations that\nare frequently targeted by a specific class of cyber attack.\n\nFor more information on YARA, connect to http://code.\n[google.com/p/yara-project/.](http://code.google.com/p/yara)\n\n###### AV-suite integration\n\nPreferred NGTP solutions can integrate with popular antivirus (AV) suites (see Figure 5-3), such as McAfee, Symantec,\nSophos, and more. By integrating the NGTP solution with\nan AV suite, each malicious object can be further analyzed to\ndetermine if the AV platform was able to detect the malware\nstopped by the MPS. This enables organizations to more\nefficiently prioritize incident response follow-ups.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5-3: Sample anti-virus platform integration from FireEye.**\n\n###### Role-based access controls\n\nMost NGTP systems provide multiple user roles to ensure\nthat administrative privileges are only granted to IT personnel who require them to do their jobs. Common NGTP user\nroles include:\n\n###### ;; [System administrator][ – full administrative con-]\n\ntrol over the entire NGTP deployment.\n###### ;; [Regional administrator][ – administrative control ]\n\nover one or more MPS appliances.\n###### ;; [Security analyst][ – access to dashboards and ]\n\nreports only; no ability to modify or delete event\ndata or modify system settings.\n\n\n###### Dashboard\n\nThe NGTP dashboard (see Figure 5-4) is the primary interface\nused by security analysts to monitor the security state of the\nnetwork and the workload of the organization’s MPS appliances. Dashboards are customarily accessed via Web browsers\nand are easy to interpret. Better dashboards offer the ability to\n“drill down” within event data to reveal details of cyber attacks\nto help the security analyst determine next steps.\n\n\n-----\n\nDON’T FORGET\n\n\n**Figure 5-4: Sample dashboard from FireEye.**\n\n###### Reports\n\nToday’s NGTP solutions provide powerful and convenient\nways to search for and report on specific types of cyber attacks\nby name or type. Organizations can view event summaries\nsuch as top infected hosts and top malware and callback\nevents, including geolocation details. Some NGTP solutions\neven provide the capability to display security event data in\nGoogle Earth!\n\nReports can be generated by NGTP users on the fly or they\ncan be automatically created at specified time intervals (daily,\nweekly, monthly) by the centralized management console.\n\nTrending reports, in particular, can help demonstrate progress\nin reducing the number of compromised systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Alerts\n\nAlerts help keep security analysts abreast of potential cyber\nbreaches. Alert notifications can typically be sent via SMTP,\nSNMP, syslog, and HTTP POST. Alerts are also displayed\nwithin the Web-based interface of the centralized management system appliance (see Figure 5-5).\n\n**Figure 5-5: Sample alerts summary from FireEye.**\n\nTIP Upon detection of a new cyber attack with an associated callback, the MPS registers one or more high-severity alerts.\nWhile the MPS appliance (if configured for inline operation) is\ncapable of severing callback communications to defuse the\nattack, it’s important to follow-up and remediate the host\ncompromised by that attack.\n\n###### Integrating NGTP into Your  Existing IT Infrastructure\n\nNo information security system should ever operate in a\nvacuum. Security products should work in concert with one\nanother — and the network infrastructure supporting them\n— to provide IT with greater context about the environment\nit’s protecting and, ultimately, reduce the risk of successful\ncyber attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe purpose of this section is to describe how NGTP systems\nintegrate with three commonly requested IT platforms, starting with SIEM.\n\n###### SIEM\n\nA SIEM (security information and event management) is\none of the most commonly requested platforms for NGTP\nintegration, especially in out-of-band deployments. And it’s\nno surprise since the entire purpose of a SIEM is to aggregate\nsecurity events from across the organization and correlate\nthem (using dozens of pre-built and custom correlation rules)\nto uncover hidden cyber attacks.\n\nSecurity events can be exported in real-time streams to SIEM\nplatforms in syslog, Common Event Format (CEF), and\nvendor-proprietary formats that offer more attack details for\ndeeper analysis.\n\nTIP Organizations also frequently integrate NGTP systems with log\nmanagement products. Like a SIEM, a log manager aggregates\nsecurity events (through syslog data), but unlike a SIEM, it\n(typically) can’t correlate data. Log managers are often chosen\nto satisfy a regulatory compliance mandate (such as PCI DSS),\nbut also provide a convenient means for aggregating log data.\n\nSample vendors include: HP ArcSight, IBM Q1 Labs,\nLogRhythm, McAfee, RSA, and Splunk.\n\n###### Security intelligence and analytics\n\nSecurity intelligence and analytics (SIA), also known as network forensics, captures every single packet that traverses the\nnetwork for a variety of purposes, including:\n\n###### ;; [Security incident response (forensics)]\n ;; [Cyber attack detection]\n ;; [Data loss monitoring and analysis]\n\nOnce an NGTP system has classified a new form of malware,\nthe analyst can employ “big data” analysis techniques and\nquery the SIA database to determine the context in which the\n\n\n-----\n\nhost was compromised and to identify other hosts potentially\ncompromised by the same attack.\n\nSome SIA vendors provide a universal connector interface that\nplugs right into the Web browser so that the NGTP user can\nclick on an IP addresses straight from the central management\nconsole to initiate a query into the SIA database, speeding the\nprocess of incident response.\n\nSample vendors include: NetWitness (RSA), Niksun, and\nSolera Networks.\n\n###### Incident management\n\nIncident management (or ticketing) platforms have been\naround for years. They are commonly used by internal IT and\nhelp desk staff to track and manage IT incidents. An incident\ncould be as simple as resolving a help desk call or as complex\nas terminating an APT.\n\nOrganizations often wish to feed NGTP alerts into their existing incident management platform. This is accomplished by\nforwarding specially formatted SMTP alerts from the NGTP\ncentral management system to the incident management\nsystem or by parsing the XML format alerts to conform to\nexisting incident alert templates.\n\nSample vendors include: BMC Remedy, Numara Software,\nand RSA Archer.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### Chapter 6\n\n### Selecting the Right  NGTP Solution\n\n###### In this chapter\n\n •• Learn what to avoid when evaluating NGTP solutions\n •• Compile your list of NGTP buying criteria\n\nhere are literally dozens of cybersecurity vendors out\nthere, right now, touting their abilities to detect and block\n\n# T\n\nadvanced cyber attacks, including zero-day attacks, polymorphic threats, and APTs. Although each of these vendors may be\nable to detect and block known attacks, very few are capable of\nblocking unknown attacks — especially when they’re targeting\nunknown (at least to the general public) operating system or\napplication vulnerabilities.\n\nIt’s important to know what to look for — and, perhaps more\nimportantly, what to avoid — when shopping for an NGTP\nsystem. Let’s start with the latter.\n\n###### What to Avoid\n\nThe following is a list of things to avoid when evaluating\nNGTP solutions:\n\n**Avoid detection-only solutions. The best NGTP offerings**\nsupport both inline and out-of-band modes of operation. Many\norganizations start with out-of-band to gain an initial level of\ncomfort and then graduate to an inline NGTP configuration to\nblock known threats, malware callbacks, and recurrences of\nnewly discovered malware. Also, when evaluating MPS appliances with copper interfaces, be sure they support fail-open\n\n\n-----\n\n**Avoid sandbox-based offerings. So-called NGTP solu-**\ntions that incorporate legacy sandbox technology are easily\noutsmarted by sophisticated threat actors. These guys design\nmalware to detect the presence of traditional sandbox technology, suppressing the payload of a malware-infected file to\navoid detection.\n\n**Avoid cloud-based malware analysis. Every NGTP solu-**\ntion should leverage the power and scalability of the cloud.\nBut preferred NGTP solutions leverage the cloud for intelligence sharing — not for malware analysis, as is the case with\nmulti-function network security solutions offering rudimentary NGTP capabilities. By incorporating the virtual execution\nengine into the MPS appliance, malware analysis is done right\nat your site, drastically improving malware-identification coverage, scalability, and ensuring confidential files never leave\nthe network.\n\n**Avoid all-in-one MPS appliances. For optimal detection**\nof today’s new breed of cyber attacks, separate purpose-built\nMPS appliances should be acquired for email, Web, and\nfile share protection — but be sure they are integrated to\nshare intelligence.\n\nNow that you know exactly what not to look for, it’s time to\nstart compiling your shopping list of NGTP characteristics\nthat are important for any security-minded organization. This\nnext section will help.\n\n###### Important Buying Criteria\n\nRegardless of an organization’s size or industry, the following\nNGTP buying criteria should be front-of-mind to every enterprise and government agency.\n\nTIP Some of the aforementioned buying criteria have already been\ndiscussed. Consider their corresponding descriptions to be\nconcise recaps. But for more-detailed explanations, flip back\nto Chapters 3 and 4 for a quick refresher.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Integrated NGTP platform for Web, email, and file inspection\n\nAlthough I’ve raised this topic more than once, it’s worth\nmentioning it again. To thwart an APT attack, it is critical to\nhave integrated protections across the common entry points\nfor malware: Web, email, and files. The best NGTP platforms\nincorporate purpose-built MPS appliances (with uniquely\ndifferent heuristics and algorithms) for detecting malware\nembedded within email messages, Web traffic, and files at\nrest, while correlating the findings to stop the APT attack\nacross the enterprise.\n\nAlthough you may save a few bucks in the short run by purchasing an MPS appliance from a vendor that claims coverage\nfor two or three of these mediums, in the long run, it’s simply\nnot worth the risk to invest in a partial solution.\n\n###### Monitors ingress and egress traffic\n\nTypical NGTP systems monitor ingress (inbound) traffic from\nwebsites and email messages to identify suspicious binaries\nthat may contain advanced malware. Most NGTP systems\ndo not monitor egress (outbound) traffic, and then, surprisingly, some NGTP only monitor egress traffic. By monitoring\nboth ingress and egress traffic, the MPS appliance can\ndetect both inbound malware and corresponding outbound\ncallback attempts.\n\nDON’T FORGET Monitoring both ingress and egress traffic is an important\ncapability found only in leading NGTP solutions. It provides\nan additional layer of defense — especially for potentially\ninfected mobile devices hand-carried through the office\nfront door.\n\n###### Inspects broad range of file types\n\nYou might be shocked to learn that some rudimentary NGTP\nsolutions are only capable of uncovering malware in unencrypted exe and dll files. The fact of the matter is that malware\ncan be embedded in dozens of object types. This includes\nsomething as simple as an XOR-encoded binary, in the case\nof Operation Aurora, or a Microsoft Excel file, which triggered\n\n\n-----\n\na zero-day Flash exploit in the attack against RSA Security\n(see “RSA Security steps forward to describe its APT attack”\nsidebar in Chapter 3).\n\nDON’T FORGET Hybrid document exploits highlight the need for broad network security coverage. In the case of the RSA Security\nbreach, the Excel spreadsheet did not attack Microsoft Excel,\nbut rather triggered an exploit against a separate\napplication altogether.\n\nA good NGTP solution applies sophisticated heuristics and\nmalware-detection algorithms to uncover advanced malware\nin Web pages as well as across dozens of file types, including\ncom, doc, docx, gif, jpg, mov, mp3, mp4, pdf, png, ppt, pptx,\nswf, tiff, xls, xlsx, zip, and many more.\n\n###### Solution for manual  malware analysis\n\nThe virtual execution engine contained within the MPS\nappliance is frequently analyzing (even remotely) suspicious\nfiles for advanced malware. In doing so, it provides security\nanalysts with forensic details about the exploit, including the\nvulnerability exploited to create a buffer overflow condition,\nattempts to escalate privileges within Windows, and the callback coordinates used to exfiltrated data.\n\nExperienced incident responders sometimes prefer to analyze\nmalware by hand to gain a full 360-degree view of the attack,\nfrom the initial exploit and malware execution to follow-on\nbinary download attempts. To satisfy this hunger for rich\nforensic data, leading NGTP providers offer a stand-alone\nmalware analysis system (MAS), which is typically packaged\non a convenient rackmount appliance.\n\nThe MAS should incorporate instrumented, automatically\nconfigured virtual machines equipped with various versions\nof Microsoft Windows and a number of software applications,\nsuch as Microsoft Office and Adobe Reader. This environment\nlets analysts drill into suspicious (or known-infected) binaries\nto gain a deep understanding of the intent and targets of the\ncyber attackers, without the overhead of creating and maintaining a range of custom test environments.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### No false positives or false negatives\n\nFalse positives and false negatives resulting from poor NGTP\ndetection can prove costly for any organization. A false\npositive (good file classified as bad) could mean blocking a\nbusiness-critical file from reaching its destination, resulting\nin lost time and lost revenue. A false negative (bad file classified as good) is even worse as a file infected with malware\nis allowed to proceed to its final destination without further\ncause for analysis. At this point, I don’t think I need to explain\nwhat this could mean.\n\nTo say that even the best NGTP system on the market will\nnever render a false positive or a false negative is, perhaps, a\nbit of a stretch. But such occurrences should be very few and\nfar between.\n\nDON’T FORGET To assess the detection quality of an NGTP solution on your\nshortlist, put it through its paces by performing an onsite evaluation. If you’re evaluating two competing solutions, test them\nboth at the same time using the same production traffic (in\npassive, out-of-band mode) and compare their results.\n\n###### Support for custom rules\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 5, NGTP administrators sometimes\nwish to import custom byte-level rules created using the YARA\nrules language to trigger analysis of all matched objects for\nthreats specific to an organization. (This is akin to creating\ncustom signatures for a network IPS.)\n\nWhen evaluating competing NGTP offerings, consider the\nextensibility of the solution and its ability to support custom\nmalware detection rules.\n\n###### Intuitive user interface\n\nIt makes no difference how powerful or feature-rich a security\napplication is. If it’s too difficult to use, it’s unlikely to be\nadopted by an IT organization — at least on a large scale.\nNGTP solutions are no exception.\n\nUnlike security solutions that require tuning or creation of\npolicy rule sets, such as a traditional firewall or IPS appliance an NGTP system is a far more automated solution\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, it’s important that the dashboard be simple and\neasy to use, and constructing reports and alerts should not\nrequire a PhD in astrophysics.\n\n###### Responsive customer support\n\nSelecting an NGTP vendor is just as important as selecting\nan NGTP product — if not more so. High-quality technical\nsupport is frequently reported by enterprises and government agencies as a top decision criterion for selecting any\nIT system.\n\nTIP Be sure to assess the quality of a vendor’s customer support\nservice prior to making your purchasing decision. To do so,\nreach out to the vendor’s technical support department at\nleast twice during the evaluation phase, rather than the SE\nassigned to your account. Even if you don’t have any problems\nwith your evaluation, make something up. Perhaps ask a general question about the product’s functionality. When doing\nso, gauge the experience and responsiveness of the tech support representative and note how long it took you to reach a\nhuman being. If it took 30 minutes to speak with a representative, and that person was unable to answer a simple configuration question, then it may be time to move onto a\ncompeting offering.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Glossary\n\n**advanced persistent threat (APT): A sophisticated**\ncyber attack that employs advanced stealth techniques to\nremain undetected for extended periods of time.\n\n**advanced targeted attack (ATA): Another name for**\nadvanced persistent threat.\n\n**baiting: A social-engineering attack in which physical**\nmedia (such as a USB flash drive) containing malware is\ndeliberately left in proximity to a targeted organization.\n\n**blended threat: A cyber attack incorporating a**\ncombination of attacks against different vulnerabilities.\n\n**bot: An infected computer (or endpoint) centrally**\ncontrolled by a command and control (CnC) server.\n\n**buffer overflow attack: An attack accomplished by**\nplacing more data into the buffer than it is configured to\nhold which ends up enabling the attacker to run custom\ncode (oftentimes with the escalated privileges granted to\nthe vulnerable application or network service).\n\n**BYOD (bring your own device): An organizational**\npolicy of employees bringing personally owned devices to\ntheir place of work to access the organization’s data.\n\n**central management system (CMS): A rackmount**\nappliance responsible for monitoring and managing MPS\nappliances within an NGTP environment.\n\n**cloud threat intelligence network: An Internet-**\nbased service managed by an NGTP vendor to distribute\n(and receive) cyber attack intelligence to (and from) its\ncustomers’ MPS appliances.\n\n**CnC (command-and-control) server: A server**\noperated by a cybercriminal to provide instructions to\nbots.\n\n**cybercriminal: A hacker illegally stealing data from**\n\n\n-----\n\n**cyberterrorism: The use of Internet-based attacks in**\nterrorist activities, including acts of deliberate, large-scale\ndisruption of computer networks.\n\n**cyberwar: Politically motivated hacking to conduct**\nsabotage and/or espionage against a nation state.\n\n**data leakage prevention (DLP): A system designed to**\ndetect potential data loss based on patterns (such as social\nsecurity numbers) in a timely manner.\n\n**defense-in-depth strategy: Installing a series of**\ncybersecurity defenses so that a threat missed by one layer\nof security may be caught by another.\n\n**denial-of-service (DoS) attack: A cyber attack**\nintended to disrupt or disable a targeted host by flooding\nit with benign communication requests from a single host.\n\n**egress traffic: Computer network traffic flowing from**\ninside the network to hosts outside the network.\n\n**fail open: The ability of copper interfaces on a network**\nappliance to maintain connectivity to prevent network\ndisruption upon appliance power loss or disruption.\n\n**false negative: Misclassifying a file containing malware**\nas benign.\n\n**false positive: Misclassifying a benign file as containing**\nmalware.\n\n**hacktivism: The use of computers and computer**\nnetworks as a means to protest and/or promote political\nends.\n\n**inline mode: Placement of a network appliance directly**\nin the line of network traffic enabling it to block cyber\nattacks.\n\n**ingress traffic: Computer network traffic flowing from**\noutside the network to hosts within the network.\n\n**intrusion detection system (IDS): An out-of-band**\nsignature-based security device that monitors network\n\n\n-----\n\n**intrusion protection system (IPS): An inline (active)**\nsignature-based security device that monitors network\ntraffic and blocks known cyber attacks upon detection.\n\n**keylogger: An application that records keystrokes on a**\ncomputer usually unbeknownst to the user.\n\n**malware: Malicious software (such as a computer virus,**\nworm, or Trojan) created to disrupt computer operation,\ngather sensitive information, or gain access to private\ncomputer systems.
