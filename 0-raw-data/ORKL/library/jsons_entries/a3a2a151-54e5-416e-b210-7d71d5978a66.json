It captures information using plugins to compromise\nwebcam and microphone output along with documenting log keystrokes, carrying out\nsurveillance and access external drives.\n\nThe modular malware UNITEDRAKE is compatible with systems running on Microsoft\nWindows XP, Vista, 7, 8 up to Windows Server 2012. UNITEDRAKE is described as a “fully\nextensible” data collection tool that is specifically developed for Windows machines to allow\noperators the chance of controlling a device completely.\n\nAs cited by [ZDNet, the malware modules like FOGGYBOTTOM and](http://www.zdnet.com/article/shadowbrokers-return-with-the-release-of-unitedrake-exploit/) [GROK can successfully](https://www.hackread.com/shadow-brokers-quit-operation-giving-away/)\nlisten to and monitor communications, and keep a check on keystrokes, webcam, and\nmicrophone. When the task is completed, the malware is able to self-destruct.\nUnderstandably, the NSA developed this tool to carry out mass surveillance and performed\nbulk hacking.\n\nWe first heard about [UNITEDRAKE RAT back in 2014 when former NSA contractor Edward](https://search.edwardsnowden.com/search?codewords_facet=UNITEDRAKE)\nSnowden exposed an array of confidential documents in a high-profile scandal exposing the\nespionage tactics used by the NSA for decades. Snowden revealed a glaring truth related to\nNSA spying tactics that the agency had been using multiple malware programs to infect not\nhundreds or thousands but millions of computers across the globe to acquire valuable,\nsensitive data.\n\nOn the other hand, ShadowBrokers group made headlines in 2016 when it claimed to have\n[robbed various exploitation tools used by the NSA including the notorious ETERNALBLUE](https://www.hackread.com/leaked-nsa-exploit-eternalblue-used-in-trojan-attacks/)\n[that was a vital component in the WannaCry ransomware campaign causing damages to](https://www.hackread.com/tag/WannaCry/)\nsystems worldwide. The claim was proved to be authentic by security experts as well.\n\nShadowBrokers has now decided to release two data dumps every month dubbed as the\nMonthly Dump Service. For its latest data dump, the group is expecting to receive 500\nZcash, a type of cryptocurrency, which facilitates secure, private transactions. It is worth\nnoting that the current rate of Zcash is US$248 per unit or A$309.50 per unit.\n\n\n-----\n\nScreenshot from ShadowBrokers’s post on Steemit.\n\n[The data dump also includes a UNITEDRAKE manual, which means the group is trying to](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3987443/The-Shaow-Brokers-UNITEDRAKE-Manual.pdf)\ngenerate additional interest among cyber criminals, vendors, and government groups to\nsubscribe to services which provide access to the stolen exploits and malware models.\n\nAccording to ShadowBrokers, five NSA data dumps are in the pipeline currently and the\ngroup is demanding a whopping 16,000 Zcash for files to be released on November 15.\nMoreover, to further enlarge the profits, ShadowBrokers intend to make previous data dumps\navailable again for purchase and this time the price range will be somewhere between 100\nZEC ($24,000) and 1600 ZEC ( $3.8m).\n\nThe group’s subscription service is currently operating discreetly. However, the members\nhave started complaining about the tools not working as expected. A few months back one of\n[its subscribers came out in public and complained that the “Wine of the month” club was a](https://steemit.com/shadowbrokers/@fsyourmoms/theshadowbrokers-are-not-making-america-great-again)\nfake scheme.\n\n\n-----",
