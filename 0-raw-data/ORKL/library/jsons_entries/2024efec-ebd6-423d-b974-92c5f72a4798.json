    "plain_text": "# Premium SMS Scam Apps on Play Store\n\n**[blog.avast.com/premium-sms-scam-apps-on-play-store-avast](https://blog.avast.com/premium-sms-scam-apps-on-play-store-avast)**\n\nA fake photo editor, camera filter, games and other apps promoted via Instagram and TikTok\nchannels\n\nLast week, I reported 80 apps belonging to a premium SMS scam campaign, which signs\nvictims up for expensive premium SMS services that earn a bad actor or actors money while\nultimately leaving victims completely empty-handed, to Google’s Security Team. This led to\ntheir swift removal from the Google Play Store. The apps that I discovered are part of the\n[UltimaSMS campaign, consisting of 151 apps that at one point or another had been available](https://github.com/avast/ioc/tree/master/UltimaSMS)\nfor download on the Google Play Store. These apps have been downloaded more than 10.5\nmillion times, and are nearly identical in structure and functionality; essentially copies of the\nsame fake app used to spread the premium SMS scam campaign. This leads me to believe\nthat one bad actor or group is behind the entire campaign. I have dubbed the campaign\n“UltimaSMS”, because one of the first apps I discovered was called Ultima Keyboard 3D\n_Pro._\n\nThe fake apps I found feature a wide range of categories such as custom keyboards, QR\ncode scanners, video and photo editors, spam call blockers, camera filters, and games,\namong others. UltimaSMS appears to be a global campaign, as according to insights from\nSensor Tower, a mobile apps marketing intelligence and insights company, the apps have\nbeen downloaded by users from over 80 countries. The apps have been most downloaded\nby users in the Middle East, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, followed by users in the\n\n\n-----\n\nUS and Poland. Avast has traced the earliest UltimaSMS samples to May 2021 and new\nsamples from the campaign were released earlier this month, meaning that the scam is still\nongoing.\n\n_The above table shows the top 10 countries where the apps have been downloaded,_\n_according to Sensor Tower_\n\n## How UltimaSMS scams users\n\nWhen a user installs one of the apps, the app checks their location, International Mobile\nEquipment Identity (IMEI), and phone number to determine which country area code and\nlanguage to use for the scam. Once the user opens the app, a screen, localized in the\nlanguage their device is set to, prompts them to enter their phone number, and in some\ncases, email address to gain access to the app’s advertised purpose.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Some of the many prompts that users can encounter upon opening the apps. They differ_\n_based on the country and are localized. Not all of them include fine print warning users’ of_\n_the potential charges._\n\nUpon entering the requested details, the user is subscribed to premium SMS services that\ncan charge upwards of $40 per month depending on the country and mobile carrier. Instead\nof unlocking the apps’ advertised features, which users might assume should happen, the\napps will either display further SMS subscriptions options or stop working altogether. The\nsole purpose of the fake apps is to deceive users into signing up for premium SMS\nsubscriptions. While some of the apps include fine print describing this to users, not all of\nthem do, meaning many people who submitted their phone numbers into the apps might not\neven realize the extra charges to their phone bill are connected to the apps.\n\n\n-----\n\n_After entering a phone number and/or email address, the apps will continue to display further_\n_SMS subscriptions or stop working altogether_\n\nOnce subscribed, the premium SMS are charged weekly and, from what I can tell, appear to\nbe the maximum possible amount that can be charged in the country the user is from. Many\ncountries limit the amount of premium SMS charges that can occur within a week. The user\nmay be notified by their carrier of the excessive charges, but they could also go unnoticed for\nweeks or months. Affected users may dismiss the apps as nonfunctional and uninstall them,\nhowever, the SMS charges will continue and could amount up to an unpleasant sum.\n\n## UltimaSMS on the Play Store\n\nThe apps discovered are essentially identical in structure, meaning the same base app\nstructure is repurposed numerous times. These copies are disguised as genuine apps\nthrough well constructed app profiles on the Play Store. The profiles feature catchy photos\nand enticing app descriptions alongside often high review averages. However, upon closer\ninspection, they have generic privacy policy statements and feature basic developer profiles\nincluding generic email addresses. They also tend to have numerous negative reviews from\n[users that correctly identified the apps as scams or have fallen for the scam.](https://www.avast.com/c-report-internet-scam)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Users often correctly recognize the scam apps in reviews_\n\nUltimaSMS has been propagated through advertising channels on popular social media sites\nsuch as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, as seen with other [recent scams and cases of](https://blog.avast.com/scam-apps-spreading-via-tiktok-avast)\n[adware. There are numerous catchy video advertisements targeting users on these social](https://www.avast.com/c-adware)\nmedia platforms. It speaks to the size and impact of this particular strain of scam apps, as\n[the malicious actors are spending funds to boost downloads. Premium SMS scams are](https://www.avast.com/c-how-to-stop-spam-text-messages)\nincreasingly prevalent as evidenced by Zimperium’s reporting of [GriftHorse, for example. In](https://blog.zimperium.com/grifthorse-android-trojan-steals-millions-from-over-10-million-victims-globally/)\nfact, these types of scams are not new at all, they appear to just be making a comeback.\nYears ago there were malware families that would secretly use dial-up modems to dial-up\npremium services, racking up thousands of dollars in charges.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Advert shown on Facebook for the Projector HD/AR Video Editor app_\n\n## How to avoid UltimaSMS and similar scams\n\n\n-----\n\n**Remain vigilant when downloading new apps, especially apps advertised in**\nshort and catchy videos. Children may be particularly vulnerable to this type of\nscam.\n\n**Disable premium SMS option with your carrier. While there are legitimate**\nuses for premium SMS, such as donating to charities, it is an easy avenue for\nmalicious actors to abuse. Disabling this option will nullify the UltimaSMS scam.\nBased on some of the user accounts that left negative reviews, it looks like\nchildren are among the victims, making this step especially important on\n[children’s phones, as they may be more susceptible to this type of scam.](https://www.avast.com/c-scam)\n\n**Carefully check reviews. Scam apps often have boosted review averages, but**\nwritten reviews may reveal the true purpose of an app. Checking the developer’s\nhistory and profile may also be useful.\n\n**Don’t enter a phone number unless you trust the app. Being careful with**\npersonal details, including phone number and email, goes a long way to avoiding\nsimilar scams.\n\n**Read the fine print before entering details. Legitimate apps will have Terms of**\nService and a Privacy policy alongside a statement of how they intend to use\nyour data and entered details.\n\n**Be cautious when you find more than one app with the same name.**\nMalicious apps can sometimes use the name and image of existing real and safe\napps. In this scenario, a malicious app was found to be masquerading as\n[Truecaller, a caller ID and spam blocking app by True Software Scandinavia AB](https://www.avast.com/c-spam)\nused by over 290 million people.\n\n**Stick to official app stores when downloading apps. Although these apps were**\navailable on the Google Play Store, they have been removed by Google’s\nsecurity team, but they are still available for download elsewhere on the internet.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[To explore the list of UltimaSMS IOCs, check out the dedicated page on GitHub.](https://github.com/avast/ioc/tree/master/UltimaSMS)_\n\n\n-----",
