    "plain_text": "# Russian SVR Targets U.S. and Allied Networks\n\n### Executive summary\n\nRussian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) actors (also known as APT29, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes) frequently use\npublicly known vulnerabilities to conduct widespread scanning and exploitation against vulnerable systems in an effort to\nobtain authentication credentials to allow further access. This targeting and exploitation encompasses U.S. and allied\nnetworks, including national security and government-related systems.\n\nRecent Russian SVR activities include compromising SolarWinds[®] Orion[®] software updates,[[1]] targeting COVID-19\nresearch facilities through deploying WellMess malware,[[2]] and leveraging a VMware[®] vulnerability that was a zero-day at\nthe time for follow-on Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication abuse.[[3]] SVR cyber actors also used\nauthentication abuse tactics following SolarWinds-based breaches.[[4]] [[5]]\n\nThe SVR has exploited—and continues to successfully exploit—software vulnerabilities to gain initial footholds into victim\ndevices and networks, to include:\n\n#####  CVE-2018-13379 Fortinet[®][[2]]\n  CVE-2019-9670 Zimbra[®][[2]]\n  CVE-2019-11510 Pulse Secure[®][[2]]\n  CVE-2019-19781 Citrix[®][[2]]\n  CVE-2020-4006 VMware[®][[3]]\n\nThe National Security Agency (NSA), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) previously shared mitigations to defend against exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Knowing the\ntradecraft that nation-state cyber actors use along with relevant response actions will enable network defenders to focus\non mitigating the vulnerabilities and techniques, enabling more comprehensive protection against adversary compromise.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Detailed vulnerabilities and mitigations\n\nNSA, CISA, and FBI are aware that United States Government, critical infrastructure (including Defense Industrial Base),\nand allied networks are consistently scanned, targeted, and exploited by Russian state-sponsored cyber actors. NSA,\nCISA, and FBI recommend that critical system owners prioritize the following mitigation actions to mitigate the loss of\nsensitive information that could impact U.S. policies, strategies, plans, ongoing operations, and competitive advantage.\nAdditionally, due to the various systems and networks that could be impacted outside of these sectors, NSA, CISA, and\nFBI recommend that the following mitigations be prioritized for action by all network defenders.\n\nThe techniques leveraged by SVR actors include[1]:\n\n#####  Exploiting public-facing applications (T1190[2])\n  Leveraging external remote services (T1133)\n  Compromising supply chains (T1195)\n  Using valid accounts (T1078)\n  Exploiting software for credential access (T1212)\n  Forging web credentials: SAML tokens (T1606.002)\n\nWhile some vulnerabilities have specific additional mitigations below, the following general mitigations apply:\n\n#####  Keep systems and products updated and patch as soon as possible after patches are released since many actors\nexploit numerous vulnerabilities.[3]\n\n#####  Expect that the risk from data stolen or modified (including credentials, accounts, and software) before a device was\npatched will not be alleviated by patching or simple remediation actions. Assume that a breach will happen, enforce\nleast-privileged access, and make password changes and account reviews a regular practice.[4]\n\n#####  Disable external management capabilities and set up an out-of-band management network.[5]\n  Block obsolete or unused protocols at the network edge and disable them in device configurations.[6]\n  Isolate Internet-facing services in a network Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to reduce exposure of the internal network.[7]\n  Enable robust logging of Internet-facing services and authentication functions. Continuously hunt for signs of\ncompromise or credential misuse, particularly within cloud environments.[8]\n\n#####  Adopt a mindset that compromise happens: prepare for incident response activities, only communicate about\nbreaches on out-of-band channels, and take care to uncover a breach’s full scope before remediating.[9]\n\nThe following is a list of specific Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) being actively exploited by SVR actors, a\ndescription of the vulnerability, and the recommended mitigations.\n\n**CVE Number** **Vulnerability Description**
