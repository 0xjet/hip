First\nseen in October 2017, Burkina is a trojan distributed through executable (EXE) files sent via\nemail.\n\n## Customer Impact\n\nBurkina infects a victim’s computer and attempts to harvest credentials, interrupt standard\nprocesses, conceal network connections, and other malicious actions. The malware then\nreaches out to a command and control (C&C) server to receive additional instructions.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actor can use the stolen credentials to carry out additional malicious acts,\nincluding dropping a ransomware package or distributing additional payloads such as\nTrickbot.1\n\n## Campaign Analysis\n\nThe campaign we observed delivered Burkina via spam emails. Both the subject line –\n_WG:Re:AG:Re:New order. – and body – See attached PDF – of each message were_\nidentical. The emails carried a malicious EXE attachment masquerading as a PDF with the\nfilename SPL6677.pdf.exe.\n\n## Attack Chain\n\nOnce the user opens the attached file, the executable will present the message\n“SimpleGameLib has stopped working” to the user.\n\nBurkina drops another executable file named WerFault.exe and updates the AutoRun\nRegistry to include itself. It then attempts to harvest credentials and saved passwords once\nthe user opens a browser. Finally, the malware attempts to connect to a C&C server to\nreceive further instructions as well as to exfiltrate the stolen data.\n\n## Vulnerabilities & Mitigation\n\nInfoblox recommends the following precautions to reduce the possibility of infection by\nBurkina:\n\nBe cautious of emails from unfamiliar senders and inspect unexpected attachments\nbefore opening them.\nAlways be suspicious of vague emails, especially if there is a prompt to open an\nattachment or click on a URL or clickable text.\nFilter attachments to reduce the likelihood of malicious content reaching a user’s\nworkstation.\nBe aware of any attachment’s file type and never openfiles that could be a script (.vbs,\n.cmd, .bat) or another executable (.exe).\nEnsure you read the file type correctly as many threat actors will include a trusted file\ntype description in the name (.pdf, .docx, .xls, etc.)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Endnotes\n\n[1. https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/325825/0/html/](https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/325825/0/html)\n[2. https://howtofix.guide/heur-msil-burkina-1/](https://howtofix.guide/heur-msil-burkina-1/)\n\n\n-----",
