While the identity of the attackers remains\nunconfirmed, there is some evidence to suggest a link to the Iranian Seedworm (aka\nMuddyWater) group. The targeting and tactics are consistent with Iranian-sponsored actors.\n\n## Attack outline\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter breaching a targeted network, the attackers typically attempt to steal credentials and\nmove laterally across the network. They appear to be particularly interested in Exchange\nServers, deploying web shells onto them. In some cases, the attackers may be using\ncompromised organizations as stepping stones to additional victims. Furthermore, some\ntargets may have been compromised solely to perform supply-chain-type attacks on other\norganizations.\n\nIn most attacks, the infection vector is unknown. Evidence of a possible vector was found at\nonly one target. A suspected ScreenConnect setup MSI appeared to have been delivered in\na zipped file named “Special discount program.zip”, suggesting that it arrived in a spearphishing email.\n\n## Telecoms attack\n\nIn one attack against a telecoms firm in the Middle East, which began in August 2021, the\nfirst evidence of compromise was the creation of a service to launch an unknown Windows\nScript File (WSF). Scripts were then used to issue various domain, user discovery, and\nremote service discovery commands.\n\nThe attackers used PowerShell to download another WSF and run it. Net group was used to\nquery for the “exchange trusted subsystem” domain group.\n\nThe attackers used Certutil to download a suspected Ligolo tunneling tool and launch WMI,\nwhich was used to get remote machines to carry out the following tasks:\n\nExecute Certutil to download an unknown file\nExecute Certutil to download an unknown WSF file and execute Wscript to launch this\nscript\nExecute PowerShell to download and execute content\nExecute PowerShell to download a suspected web shell to an Exchange Server\n\nBased on process lineage data, attackers seemed to use scripts extensively. These may be\nautomated scripts used for collecting information and downloading additional tools. However,\nin one instance, a command asks cURL for help, suggesting that there may have been at\nleast some hands-on-keyboard activity on the part of the attackers.\n\nThe attackers then used a remote access tool, believed to be eHorus, to perform the\nfollowing tasks:\n\nDeliver and run a suspected Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)\ndumping tool\nDeliver what are believed to be Ligolo tunneling tools\nExecute Certutil to request a URL from Exchange Web Services (EWS) of what\nappears to be other targeted organizations\n\n\n-----\n\nOne feature of this attack against a telecoms organization is that the attackers may have\nattempted to pivot to other targets by connecting to the Exchange Web Services (EWS) of\nother organizations, another telecoms operator, and an electronic equipment company in the\nsame region. The following commands were used:\n\ncertutil.exe -urlcache –split [DASH]f hxxps://[REDACTED]/ews/exchange[.]asmx\ncertutil.exe -urlcache -split [DASH]f hxxps://webmail.[REDACTED][.]com/ews\n\nIt is unclear what the intent of these requests is. It is possible the attackers were attempting\nto check connectivity to these organizations.\n\n## Possible supply chain attack\n\nOne target that appeared to be an outlier was a utility company in Laos. The infection vector\nmay have been the exploit of a public-facing service since the first machine that appeared to\nbe compromised was an IIS web server. Suspicious activity also had w3wp.exe in the\nprocess lineage.\n\nThe attackers then used PowerShell to:\n\nDownload a suspected Ligolo tunneling tool\nDownload an unknown PowerShell script\nDownload an unknown XLS file\n\nThe attackers then used PowerShell to connect to a webmail server of an organization in\nThailand. They also attempted to connect to IT-related servers belonging to another\ncompany in Thailand.\n\nTo facilitate credential theft, WMI was used to execute PowerShell to modify the registry to\nstore passwords in plaintext in memory. In addition to this, an obfuscated version of the\npublicly available CrackMapExec tool appeared to be deployed.\n\n## Toolset\n\nThe attackers made heavy use of legitimate tools and publicly available hacking tools. These\ninclude:\n\nScreenConnect: Legitimate remote administration tool\nRemoteUtilities: Legitimate remote administration tool\neHorus: Legitimate remote administration tool\nLigolo: Reverse tunneling tool\nHidec: Command line tool for running a hidden window\nNping: Packet generation tool\nLSASS Dumper: Tool that dumps credentials from Local Security Authority Subsystem\nService (LSASS) process\n\n\n-----\n\nSharpChisel: Tunneling tool\nPassword Dumper\nCrackMapExec: Publicly available tool that is used to automate security assessment of\nan Active Directory environment\nProcDump: Microsoft Sysinternals tool for monitoring an application for CPU spikes\nand generating crash dumps, but which can also be used as a general process dump\nutility\nSOCKS5 proxy server: Tunneling tool\nKeylogger: Retrieves browser credentials\nMimikatz: Publicly available credential dumping tool\n\n## Seedworm link?\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that the Iranian Seedworm group was responsible for\nthese attacks. Two IP addresses used in this campaign have been previously linked to\nSeedworm activity. However, Seedworm is known to regularly switch its infrastructure,\nmeaning conclusive attribution cannot be made.\n\nThere is also some overlap in tools between this campaign and earlier Seedworm\ncampaigns. ScreenConnect, RemoteUtilities, SharpChisel, Ligolo, ProcDump, and Password\n[Dumper were all referenced by Trend Micro in a March 2021 blog on Seedworm activity.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/c/earth-vetala---muddywater-continues-to-target-organizations-in-t.html)\n\nIn the case of two tools – SharpChisel and Password Dumper – identical versions were used\nin this campaign to those that were documented by Trend.\n\n## Focused campaign\n\nIf these attacks are linked to Iran, it will not be the first time an Iranian threat actor has\ntargeted the telecoms sector. [In 2018, Symantec revealed that the Chafer group had](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/chafer-latest-attacks-reveal-heightened-ambitions)\ncompromised of a major telecoms services provider in the Middle East.\n\nWhile the ultimate end goal of the campaign remains unknown, the focus on telecoms\noperators suggests that the attackers are gathering intelligence on the sector and possibly\nattempting to pivot into spying on communications.\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\n[For the latest protection updates, please visit the Symantec Protection Bulletin.](https://www.broadcom.com/support/security-center/protection-bulletin)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nae5d0ad47328b85e4876706c95d785a3c1387a11f9336844c39e75c7504ba365 – Ligolo\n\ne0873e15c7fb848c1be8dc742481b40f9887f8152469908c9d65930e0641aa6b – Ligolo\n\n\n-----\n\n22e7528e56dffaa26cfe722994655686c90824b13eb51184abfe44d4e95d473f – Hidec\n\nb0b97c630c153bde90ffeefc4ab79e76aaf2f4fd73b8a242db56cc27920c5a27 – Nping\n\nb15dcb62dee1a8499b8ac63064a282a06abf0f7d0302c5e356cdb0c7b78415a9 – LSASS\nDumper\n\n61f83466b512eb12fc82441259a5205f076254546a7726a2e3e983011898e4e2 –\nSharpChisel\n\nccdddd1ebf3c5de2e68b4dcb8fbc7d4ed32e8f39f6fdf71ac022a7b4d0aa4131 – Password\nDumper\n\nfacb00c8dc1b7ed209507d7c56d18b2c542c4e0b2986b9bfaf1764d8e252576b –\nCrackMapExec\n\n1a107c3ece1880cbbdc0a6c0817624b0dd033b02ebaf7fa366306aaca22c103d – ProcDump\n\n916cc8d6bf2282ae0d2db587f4f96780af59e685a1f1a511e0b2b276669dc802 – ProcDump\n\ne2a7a9a803c6a4d2d503bb78a73cd9951e901beb5fb450a2821eaf740fc48496 – ProcDump\n\nf6600e5d5c91ed30d8203ef2bd173ed0bc431453a31c03bc363b89f77e50d4c5 - SOCKS5\nproxy server\n\n6d73c0bcdf1274aeb13e5ba85ab83ec00345d3b7f3bb861d1585be1f6ccda0c5 – Keylogger\n\n912018ab3c6b16b39ee84f17745ff0c80a33cee241013ec35d0281e40c0658d9 – Mimikatz\n\n96632f716df30af567da00d3624e245d162d0a05ac4b4e7cbadf63f04ca8d3da – Mimikatz\n\nbee3d0ac0967389571ea8e3a8c0502306b3dbf009e8155f00a2829417ac079fc – Mimikatz\n\nd9770865ea739a8f1702a2651538f4f4de2d92888d188d8ace2c79936f9c2688 - Mimikatz\n\n## About the Author\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n**Symantec**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to\ninvestigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer\nanalysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n\n-----",
