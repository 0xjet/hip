Through the intelligence gathered from the Zscaler cloud, we discovered several newly registered domains that use\nVoIP and voicemail as themes for their credential-stealing phishing campaigns. In the most recent instance we saw, attackers\nwere spoofing Cisco’s Unity Connection voicemail platform.\n\nThis social engineering campaign is specifically designed to reach end users in large enterprises. The use of voicemail\ndelivered in an email message, and the use of phishing pages that spoof enterprise applications, such as Office 365 and\nOutlook, signal the attackers’ motives. If successful in obtaining a user’s credentials, attackers can access confidential data\nfrom the enterprise, potentially selling it or holding it for ransom. They can also leverage company information to launch\ntargeted attacks, which can give them an even greater foothold in the network and cause extensive damage and potential loss\nfor the enterprise.\n\nIn this blog, we will describe how the current attacks are being carried out, the campaign’s variants and evasion techniques,\nand the various social engineering tactics in use.\n\n## Distribution method\n\nThe attacks are being distributed through email with an HTML attachment that contains JavaScript code which redirects the\nuser to the credential phishing site.\n\nContents of the email are crafted to mimic a system-generated voicemail notification, luring the user to open the attachment to\naccess the recorded voice message as shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Email message spoofing a voicemail notification_\n\n## HTML attachment analysis\n\nWe observed different variants of HTML attachments used in these credential-phishing campaigns.\n\n### Variant #1\n\nThe email attachment is an HTML file that contains a short code snippet of JavaScript. It uses window.location.replace() to\nredirect the user to the phishing site, as shown in Figure 2.\n\n_Figure 2: Contents of HTML attachment_\n\nWe discovered more than 200 HTML email attachments of this variant, and we observed the following similarities between\nthem.\n\nAll of these HTML attachments followed the naming convention: Play_VN_<string_of_11_digits>.html\n\nAn icon of a telephone was used in the filename for social engineering purposes\n\nAll these HTML attachments have a very low detection rate on VirusTotal as shown in Figure 3 below.\n\nFurthermore, the first sample of this variant was observed in the wild on April 21, 2020; the fact that this theme is still being\nused suggests that the threat actors have achieved decent success with it.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: No detection against AV engines, as seen on VirusTotal\n\n### Variant #2\n\nIn the second variant, the HTML attachment contains JavaScript code that is used to decode the next-stage HTML. It uses a\nsimple URL encoding which is decoded using the unescape() function and then loaded in the browser as shown in Figure 4.\n\n_Figure 4: HTML attachment containing encoded JavaScript_\n\nThe decoded content shown in Figure 5 uses the meta-refresh tag to redirect the user to the target credential phishing site.\n\n_Figure 5: Decoded content which uses meta-refresh tag to redirect_\n\n## Phishing content loaded remotely using JavaScript\n\nIn a few variants of the phishing landing pages, we observed that the final landing page used an external JavaScript to display\nthe credential-phishing page in the browser. Figure 6 shows the source code of the phishing page; the highlighted part is the\nexternal JavaScript used to display the phishing content. All of these external JavaScript files use long filenames of 32\ncharacters resembling an MD5 hash.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Phishing landing page referencing an externally hosted JavaScript to load phishing content_\n\nUnlike common credential-phishing landing pages, we can see in this case that there is no information related to the brand\nbeing targeted. This allows the threat actors to bypass many automated URL analysis engines and extend its survival.\n\nFigure 7 shows the relevant JavaScript code and where the user’s credentials are being sent. This code is present in randomly\nnamed and externally hosted JavaScript files.\n\n_Figure 7: JavaScript file used to send user’s credentials to attacker’s server_\n\nFigure 8 shows a sample packet capture which highlights the method used to exfiltrate the stolen credentials to the attacker’s\nsite. It sends the credentials in the Base64-encoded format.\n\nIt is important to note that in the first attempt, this phishing page will always give the \"password incorrect\" message, which\nprompts users to enter their passwords more cautiously the next time.\n\n_Figure 8: Packet capture showing credentials being exfiltrated_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Captcha-based evasion technique\n\nIn one of the campaigns related to voicemail, attackers used Google’s reCAPTCHA on the landing page to evade automated\nURL analysis, as shown in Figures 9 and 10.\n\n_Figure 9: Google’s reCAPTCHA used for evading automated URL analysis_\n\n_Figure 10: Google reCAPTCHA used as a security challenge on the phishing page for evasion_\n\nUsers will be redirected to the main credential-phishing page after solving the captcha. The final phishing page spoofs the\nMicrosoft Office 365 login page, as shown in Figures 11 and 12.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11: Credential-phishing landing page to steal Office 365 credentials_\n\n_Figure 12: Office 365 phishing page_\n\n## XYZ top-level domain abuse\n\nBelow is a list of domains we identified that were registered between June and mid-July 2020 and were used by the threat\nactor(s) for conducting credential-phishing campaigns using the voicemail theme.\n\n\n-----\n\nnovoips[.]xyz\n\nvoced-mxd[.]xyz\n\nvoicenotes-sms[.]xyz\n\nnewvmwav-voi[.]xyz\n\nxvxvoip[.]xyz\n\nvmpla-yvmc[.]xyz\n\nvoip-sms[.]xyz\n\nvoipmails-srv[.]xyz\n\nvoipsms-ss[.]xyz\n\nvoicemail-srv[.]xyz\n\nvoicemail-sms[.]xyz\n\nThese domains share some similarities in their naming convention:\n\nAll the domains were using the top-level domain (TLD) of XYZ\n\nThe domain names contained keywords such as “voip,” “voicemail,” and “sms” for social engineering purposes\n\nMost of these domains were registered with the German-based hosting service: “1und1”\n\nThe URL pattern used for credential phishing is: hxxp://domain_name.xyz/?e=<email_address>\n\nThe parameter e in the URL corresponds to the recipient's email address\n\nIf the URL is accessed directly without the email address in the URL as a parameter, the user will be redirected to the\noffice.com site\n\nWe can see that the attackers took several measures to ensure that automated URL analysis cannot be performed and the\nURLs look convincing to the end user.\n\nOther TLDs that were abused by the threat actor in this campaign are: .club and .online. The complete list of domains used in\nthis variant of the campaign are mentioned in the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) section at the end of this blog.\n\n## Cisco Unity Connection spoofed theme\n\nOn July 6, 2020, we observed in the Zscaler cloud several connection attempts to the domain: secure.ciscovoicemail.cf which\nis a site created by the threat actor to spoof Cisco’s Unity Connection voicemail portal, as shown in Figure 13.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13: Web page spoofing Cisco Unity Connection – voicemail portal_\n\nAn icon of an audio file is displayed to the user. Once this icon is clicked, the user is redirected to the credential-phishing\nlanding page, which is designed to target multiple brands, as shown in Figure 14.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14: Landing page targeting multiple brands_\n\nBelow is the list of brands targeted by this campaign.\n\nOffice 365\nMimecast\nOutlook Web Access (OWA)\nGmail\nYahoo\nOthers (generic)\n\nOnce the user clicks on any of the above links, a corresponding phishing page is displayed. As an example, the OWA phishing\npage is displayed (Figure 15) when the user clicks the “Outlook Web Access” link on the web page.\n\n_Figure 15: OWA phishing page_\n\n## Zscaler’s detection status\n\nZscaler’s multilayered cloud security platform detects indicators at various levels, as seen here:\n\n[HTML.Phish.Microsoft](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=HTML.Phish.Microsoft)\n\n[HTML.Phish.Office365](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=HTML.Phish.Office365)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis threat actor leverages well-crafted social engineering techniques and combines them with evasion tactics designed to\nbypass automated URL analysis solutions to achieve better success in reaching users and stealing their credentials.\n\nAs an extra precaution, users should not open attachments in emails sent from untrusted or unknown sources. As a best\npractice, in general, users should verify the URL in the address bar of the browser before entering any credentials.\n\nThe Zscaler ThreatLabZ team will continue to monitor this campaign, as well as others, to help keep our customers safe.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Domains using voicemail and VoIP
