Posing as tax\ncollection authorities, adversaries seek to collect account numbers, user IDs, PINs and cell\nphone numbers from unsuspecting customers.\n\nOne such email, which was found in environments protected by Proofpoint and Microsoft,\nalleges to come from the South African Revenue Service’s (SARS) eFiling service. It claims\na tax return deposit of R12,560.5 (South African Rands), approximately $700 USD, has been\nmade to the user’s account and urges them to click on their financial institution in order to\nclaim it. The real sender of the email, however, appears to be a personal Gmail address that\nmay have been created or compromised by the adversaries.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 – (Partial) Email Body_\n\nAs seen in Figure 2, it is erroneously assigned a score of zero in Proofpoint’s “phishscore”\nmetric.\n\n_Figure 2 – Proofpoint Header_\n\n**Dragging and Dropping a Net**\n\nEach of the images embedded in the email corresponds to a different bank. Clicking on any\nof these will take the user to a spoofed login portal corresponding to the selected bank. The\nspoofed banks include ABSA, Capitec, First National Bank (FNB), Nedbank and Standard\nBank, all of which are based in South Africa. The lookalike sites are located at\n\n\n-----\n\n81[.]0[.]226[.]156 and hosted by Czech hosting provider Nethost. It should be noted that, at\nthe time of analysis, only the site for Standard Bank was unavailable. Figures below -6 show\nthe phishing portals imitating each bank.\n\n_Figure 3 – ABSA_\n\n_Figure 4 – Capitec_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 – FNB_\n\n_Figure 6 – Nedbank_\n\nAll spoofed portals were created using Webnode, a website building service known for its\nfriendly drag and drop features. Despite this ease of use, adversaries have kept things rather\nsimple, as all portals are basic forms with a few or no images. The portals ask for a variety of\npersonal information, including account numbers, passwords, PINs and even cell phone\nnumbers.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdversaries can access all entries directly from the form itself. They can also receive\nnotifications to an email address of their choosing every time a submission is made; the\nGmail account used to send the phishing email may also be where adversaries are notified\nof each and every new victim. Webnode also allows the export of form submission data in\nxml and csv formats.\n\nWebnode therefore is an optimal way to store and retrieve stolen user data. There is no need\nfor additional infrastructure, nor to compromise any third parties. As in the case of the\nStandard Bank portal, the risk of discovery and subsequent closure of spoofed sites means\nadversaries can lose access to any unretrieved information. However, this risk seems to be\noffset by the ease with which replacement spoofed sites can be created.\n\n**IOCs:**\n\nMalicious URLs:\n\nhxxps://absa9[.]webnode[.]com\nhxxps://capitec-za[.]webnode[.]com\nhxxps://first-national-bnk[.]webnode[.]com\nhxxps://nedbank-za0[.]webnode[.]com\nhxxps://standardbnk[.]webnode[.]com\n\nAssociated IPs:\n\n81[.]0[.]226[.]156\n\n**How Cofense Can Help:**\n\n[Easily consume phishing-specific threat intelligence in real time to proactively defend your](https://cofense.com/product-services/phishing-intelligence/)\n[organization against evolving threats with Cofense Intelligence™.
