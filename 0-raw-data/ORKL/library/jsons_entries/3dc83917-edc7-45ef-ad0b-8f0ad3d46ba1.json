PattiM [October 25, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-449640)\n\nThat was exactly my first thought – unlabeled graphs can’t be interpreted.\n\n3. Wajdi [October 23, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-446988)\n\nHave researchers been able to identify C&Cs and involved domain names ?\n\n\n-----\n\n4. Ben [October 23, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-447010)\n\nWe need a “patch or die” worm.\n\nRecruits a botnet of unpatched and unpatchable devices, then permanently bricks\nevery single one.\n\nA few rounds of that and the message might sink in.\n\nI am not recommending anyone does this because they will go to prison, but I still wish\nsomeone would.\n\n[1. Robert October 23, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-447090)\n\nBen, you’re not the 1st 1 to wish 4 such. Problem is, the Gov’t doesn’t seem to\ncare, manufacturers of the IoT devices don’t seem to care, ISP don’t seem to\ncare, people who own the devices don’t seem to care, yet everyone gets all bent\nout of shape when things go wrong. Well, do something about the problem\n“before” it becomes a problem! Patch, change passwords, buy more reliable Iot’s.\nBut I do hope some 12 yr old decides to stop the problem (he won’t go to jail, will\nhe?).\n\nI’ve noticed more probes of my ports for a few months, nothing major like last\nyear though. But I’m seeing lots of probes from w/i the US (probably slaved PC’s),\nincluding one I never saw in a decade of probe logs – Microsoft Media Server\n(MMS). I’m getting port probes way beyond just telnet, maybe something is up.\n\n[1. SeymourB October 24, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-448438)\n\nUnfortunately thanks to widespread use of netnannies and similar\nchildproofing our 12 year olds aren’t as technical as the generation before\nthem.\n\nWhen you shove them into padded rooms for their entire childhood, you\ncan’t be surprised that all they know are padded rooms.\n\n[2. Deb October 26, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-451103)\n\nAs long as people are making money, they will not care\n\n\n-----\n\n[2. Paul October 23, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-447223)\n\nbrickerbot may interest you\n\n[1. Robert October 24, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-448525)\n\nPaul – “brickerbot may interest you”\n\nJust did a bit of reading on Brickerbot. I can see the carnage it could cause\nas it doesn’t discriminate between an unsecured but vital piece of\nequipment in a hospital and the average IoT camera. Both get bricked.\n\n“Strong password protection” is the key that manufacturers can offer\nconsumers of IoT devices, unlocking such a device would require the same\nkey, much harder to do.\n\nI have no IoT dog in this fight so I don’t care but it can still affect me via,\nsay, that hospital device if I’m a patient! I hope that if anything good comes\nout of this new mess, it’s that manufacturers and end users will finally take\nsteps to help prevent Webageddon from making the Internet useless for\neveryone.\n\nI reacted to the Equifax breach by freezing my credit with all potential\naccess points for the bad guys. Better to do something now rather than wait\nand see if I’m going to be affected. Something about a ounce of prevention\nbeing worth a pound of cure.\n\nIf I do buy an Iot device, you can be sure it will be one that offers strong\npassword protection, one that at least tries to prevent the pound of cure\napproach. More expensive up front perhaps, but cheaper in the long run.\n\n[1. v.cardwell October 30, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-451552)\n\nIt will do nothing. they are using the smart meter on your house to\ncontrol anything in it. I know because I have been dealing with it\ninvoluntarily for about 17 years (since 2004). I have a iPhone 6s with\nsprint service, Verizon home internet suite with security and still they\nare either not interested in things they can fix then and there so the\ngapping security hole gets ignored to a Krebs-like security researcher\nfinds and then reports the problem. I’ve sent the screenshot of the\n“springboard” on my iPhone and they were stumped. the actual\nspringboard icon is missing. I tried to explain that the ITouch feature is\nnot working correctly never heard anything yet.\n\n5. Scott [October 23, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-447013)\n\nI wish you well with the web site changes.\n\nOh and thanks for the article as well.. Appreciate the work you do.\n\n\n-----\n\n6. Bryn Gerard [October 23, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-447079)\n\nTwo of my clients suffered their DVR’s being recruited to the Mirai Botnet earlier this\nyear. AVTECH have been unresponsive and as a short-term fix, unexpected ports were\nconfigured prevent the devices being compromised. Each compromised device had an\nIP address applied in the 10.*.*.* range (I can’t remember the actual configuration). The\ndevices went off line and the performance, even at the local console was severely\ndegraded. The problem for my clients is that they require access to these DVR’s as a\nkey business requirement. They haven’t been hacked since the ports were changed\nbut reading further I see that the new variant of this attack no longer requires the admin\npassword to commandeer the device. Does anyone know if it is possible to detect if\nthey have been compromised?\n\n7. Rich A [October 23, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-447130)\n\nReconsider cheering on brickerbot!\nThere probably is no economic answer to unsecured devices, except to disable them.\nhttps://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/brickerbot-the-permanentdenial-of-service-botnet-is-back-with-a-vengeance/\n\n[8. Robert Scroggins October 23, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-447166)\n\nWhat port(s) do IOTs use? Perhaps something could be done to beef up security at that\nlevel.\n\nThanks, Brian!\n\nRegards,\n\n[1. somguy October 24, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-448244)\n\nShort non technical answer:\nThey use all ports.\n\nThat’s not a solution.\n\n9. Winston [October 24, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-448163)\n\nHow vulnerable are self-funded and installed Orwell Telescreens Amazon Echo, Echo\nLook, Tap, etc. to hacking? Did they do the smart things security-wise?\n\n[1. Winstom October 25, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-449655)\n\nLooks like we’re going to see a familiar face on the IoT vulnerability subject next\nweek on Vice channel’s Cyberwar series.\n\n[1. BrianKrebs Post authorOctober 25, 2017](http://www.krebsonsecurity.com/)\n\nYup, recorded that in late spring. Will be great to see what they’ve done with\nit. I’ve enjoyed the series.\n\n\n-----\n\n[10. Chris](http://na/) [October 24, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-448169)\n\n@kerbonsecurity did you ever follow up on the 503C you where thinking of setting up in\n2016? ‘The Center for the Defense of Internet Journalism’ for those in the journalism\ncommunity that may require protection from large attacks such as the one you\nendured?\n\nThanks,\n\n[11. Dan October 24, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-448209)\n\nHi Brian, thanks for the article !\n\nJust as a note: “CheckPoint” is two words, “Check Point”.\n\n[12. Richard Stein October 24, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-448233)\n\nPlease add a vertical axis scale to the graph of “Trending Attack IP Addresses.” Would\nlike see order of magnitude – use log-scale.\n\n[1. Lori October 24, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-448467)\n\nSince several people have commented on this, I went to Check Point to find their\ngraph – and they do not have a vertical axis on it, so it would be difficult for Brian\nto provide one. Looks like it is Check Point that needs to define the scale on their\ngraph.\n\n13. Jerry [October 24, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-448305)\n\nIt appears a firmware update is available for the Linksys e1500 router after the\nidentified vulnerabilities. Hopefully it can mitigate these vulnerabilities. Thanks for\nbringing this to our attention Mr Krebs.\n\n14. Bob [October 24, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-448376)\n\nIf this is big enough and does enough damage, it might be the wake up call that is\nneeded to get the everyone to take IOT security seriously.\n\n\n-----\n\n15. Mike [October 24, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-448422)\n\nWow, that chart! The one from Checkpoint… It’s so… Meaningless.\n\nI see horizontal lines, but they don’t mean anything.\n\nWhile other readers comment that the article is good, it’s slop like this (and previous\nediting problems) that make me stop reading and just skip for the point. Get it together\nKrebs, and hire an editor.\n\n[1. SeymourB October 24, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-448470)\n\nMore than likely it was intentionally left off by CP so the authors couldn’t use it to\ndetermine the source(s) of their data.\n\nWhatever amount they note will not accurately match the real-world installations,\nso by correlating groups of systems you can do simple math to determine which\ngroups CP has access to and shut down their insight into your botnet.\n\nUnless you’re paying Brian to provide you with information, you’re not in a\nposition to make demands. Its kind of like people who use an open source project\nthen make demands to the author – sorry but it doesn’t work that way.\n\n[1. Margaret October 24, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-448929)\n\nThank you Seymour!!!!! I agree with you. Brian does a great service for us…\nmaybe we need to exert a little of our own effort to get a better\nunderstanding rather than putting a demand we have no right to do on\nBrian.\n\n2. J. W. [October 24, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-448490)\n\nComplain to Checkpoint, not Krebs. It’s identical to what’s on the Checkpoint site,\nas noted.\n\n[3. Louise October 24, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-448717)\n\nThe CheckPoint graph offers a rough summary of number of sources of infection\nworldwide.\n\nThe Y-axis represents number of organizations infected, with increments of\n100,000, and the X-axis is the time over which this was discovered, starting “the\nlast few days of September.” September 29th is the first coordinate labeled.\n\n[1. Nobby Nobbs October 25, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-449738)\n\nThanks for that, Louise. That helps a lot.\n\nThanks for keeping an eye on this, Brian. I wonder about “smart” tvs, seems\nlike they could be similarly vulnerable. And the lucky hacker might get an\nearful of archived voice commands…\n\n\n-----\n\n[16. GlenR October 24, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-449039)\n\nBrian,\nThanks for the very thought provoking post.\nYou have prompted me to start investigating yet another IoT device in my home. The\nsatellite receiver in my living room advertises itself as a WiFi connection point. I have\nno idea of its security settings, who can see it, who it talks to, or who can access it….\n\n1. Gary [October 25, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-449259)\n\nAt the very least, find the default password and change it. Ideally if you don’t use\nthe WAP, disable it.\n\n[17. Brian Failkrebs October 25, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-449583)\n\nY AXIS LABEL WHY YOU NO HAVE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!\n\ngraph fail. with great fail. in the fail fail.\n\n[1. Michael Dortch October 25, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-450106)\n\nAlways a good idea to read through the earlier comments before posting yours.\nMight save you a bit of time. Also embarrassment. 🙂\n\n18. BrickerBot sounds interesting, but I agree with the comment against it. There are better\n\nand safer ways to “fix” the Internet.\n\nI would rather see a bot that finds a problem send a notice to the tech contact on the\ndomain name (if there is one), and record the date and time of the problem. After some\nperiod of time the bot can return to see if the problem has been fixed, and if not contact\nthe other domain contacts.\n\nIf there is no domain involved, then using IP WHOIS the person or organization for the\nIP block can be notified. Failing that, I would try The upstream provider. At some point if\nthe problem is not fixed and especially if an IP range contains many problems, that\nsegment should be isolated or added to a black list.\n\nIf we can’t fix this, I foresee a future where we have two Internets, one public and one\nprivate. The private Internet will be something we pay for where the providers have a\nway to enforce any rules they see fit to establish. On it, you can expect to be really safe\nand unoffended with no parental restrictions needed.\n\n\n-----\n\n[19. Reader October 26, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-450806)\n\nWith regard to IOT, no problem for me: I’ve never trusted the idea of remote access of\nstuff in my home. If I can remote control, someone else can remote control.\n\nOur government and utility providers should also remember that if they can remote\ncontrol something, bad guys can remote control, too.\n\nBrian, please don’t make this site adaptive to devices. I REALLY HATE WHEN\nWEBSITES feed me their mobile versions, even when I’m using a small screen. And\none thing I have liked on this site is that it works perfectly, identically, and consistently\nwith or without Javascript.\n\n20. PCar [October 26, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-451308)\n\nThanks for the heads up! I did not see Apple’s AirPort Listed, so for this I am thankful! It\nnever hurts to be watchful, especially with the current WPA2 Threat, which is mild as\ncompared to your report above! The hit just keep on rolling! Thank heaven for\nkrebsonsecurity.com !\n\n[21. Robert October 26, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-451433)\n\nConsidering the new push for money from Amazon with their “Amazon Key”, I wonder\nhow long before it becomes a “prime” (pun intended) target for hackers. Not on my\nwish list but I’m sure the NSA would like all of us to have one, would make it so much\neasier to keep an eye/ear on us 😉\n\n[22. dcmargo54 October 27, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-451461)\n\nHaven’t even read the article yet. I just love the little IT men in the pic.\n\n[23. Bob Williams October 28, 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/reaper-calm-before-the-iot-security-storm/#comment-451463)\n\nFor God’s sake, Brian. “Impactful” is not a word. Your English teacher would have\nslapped you. Degradation by respected journalists of the English language is as\nslippery a slope as our slide into the cyber netherworld.\n\n-Bob\n\n[1. BrianKrebs Post authorOctober 28, 2017](http://www.krebsonsecurity.com/)\n\nBob,\n\nThere’s nothing incorrect about the word impactful. Can’t help it if someone told\nyou some time ago that it was not a word, but I assure you it is. Languages are\nliving organisms that change over time. Maybe if your own vocabulary wasn’t so\nfossilized, you’d recognize this. Merriam-Webster agrees it’s a word, btw:\n[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/impactful](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/impactful)\n\nComments are closed.\n\n\n-----",
