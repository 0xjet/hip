CISA has observed these—and other threat actors with varying degrees of\nskill—routinely using open-source information to plan and execute cyber operations. CISA leveraged\nthe MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK®) and Pre-ATT&CK\nframeworks to characterize the TTPs used by Chinese MSS-affiliated actors. This product was written\nby CISA with contributions by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n  - Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors use open-source information to plan and conduct\ncyber operations.\n\n  - Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors use readily available exploits and exploit toolkits to\nquickly engage target networks.\n\n  - Maintaining a rigorous patching cycle continues to be the best defense against the most\nfrequently used attacks.\n\n  - If critical vulnerabilities remain unpatched, cyber threat actors can carry out attacks without the\nneed to develop custom malware and exploits or use previously unknown vulnerabilities to\ntarget a network.\n\n  - This Advisory identifies some of the more common—yet most effective—TTPs employed by\ncyber threat actors, including Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors.\n\n_To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact_\n_your local FBI field office at_ _[www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field, or the FBI’s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) at](http://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field)_\n_(855) 292-3937 or by e-mail at_ _[CyWatch@fbi.gov.

In several instances, however, the defendants were_\n_unsuccessful in this regard, due to the efforts of the FBI and network defenders._\n\nThe continued use of open-source tools by Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors highlights that\nadversaries can use relatively low-complexity capabilities to identify and exploit target networks. In\nmost cases, cyber operations are successful because misconfigurations and immature patch\nmanagement programs allow actors to plan and execute attacks using existing vulnerabilities and\nknown exploits. Widespread implementation of robust configuration and patch management programs\nwould greatly increase network security. It would also reduce the speed and frequency of\nopportunistic attacks by forcing threat actors to dedicate time and funding to research unknown\nvulnerabilities and develop custom exploitation tools.\n\n### MITRE PRE-ATT&CK® Framework for Analysis\n\nIn the last 12 months, CISA analysts have routinely observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors using the\nfollowing PRE-ATT&CK® Framework TTPs.\n\n1 [https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\n\n2 [https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n#### Target Selection and Technical Information Gathering\n\n_[Target Selection [TA0014] is a critical part of cyber operations. While cyber threat actors’ motivations](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0014/)_\nand intents are often unknown, they often make their selections based on the target network’s\nsecurity posture. Threat actors can use information sources such as Shodan, the Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) database, and the National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD).[3,4,5]\n\n     - Shodan is an internet search engine that can be used to identify vulnerable devices connected\nto the internet. Shodan queries can also be customized to discover specific vulnerabilities on\ndevices, which enables sophisticated cyber threat actors to use relatively unsophisticated\ntechniques to execute opportunistic attacks on susceptible targets.\n\n     - The CVE database and the NVD contain detailed information about vulnerabilities in\napplications, appliances, and operating systems that can be exploited by cyber threat actors if\nthey remain unpatched. These sources also provide risk assessments if any of the recorded\nvulnerabilities are successfully exploited.\n\nThese information sources have legitimate uses for network defense. CISA analysts are able to\nidentify Federal Government systems that may be susceptible to exploitation attempts by using\nShodan, the CVE database, and the NVD to enrich NCPS information. Unlike threat actors, CISA\ntakes the necessary actions to notify network owners of their exposure in order to prevent an\nimpending intrusion or quickly identify intrusions as they occur.\n\nWhile using these data sources, CISA analysts have observed a correlation between the public\nrelease of a vulnerability and targeted scanning of systems identified as being vulnerable. This\ncorrelation suggests that cyber threat actors also rely on Shodan, the CVE database, the NVD, and\nother open-source information to identify targets of opportunity and plan cyber operations. Together,\nthese data sources provide users with the understanding of a specific vulnerability, as well as a list of\nsystems that may be vulnerable to attempted exploits. These information sources therefore contain\ninvaluable information that can lead cyber threat actors to implement highly effective attacks.\n\nCISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors using the techniques in table 1 to gather technical\ninformation to enable cyber operations against Federal Government networks (Technical Information\n_[Gathering [TA0015]).](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0015/)_\n\n_Table 1: Technical information gathering techniques observed by CISA_\n\n**MITRE ID** **Name** **Observation**\n\nDetermine The threat actors narrowed the attack vectors to relatively\n**[T1245](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1245/)**\nApproach/Attack Vector recent vulnerability disclosures with open-source exploits.\n\n3 [https://www.shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/)\n\n4 [https://cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org/)\n\n5 [https://nvd.nist.gov/](https://nvd.nist.gov/)\n\n|MITRE ID|Name|Observation|\n|---|---|---|\n|T1245|Determine Approach/Attack Vector|The threat actors narrowed the attack vectors to relatively recent vulnerability disclosures with open-source exploits.|\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\nAcquire Open Source CISA observed activity from network proxy service\n**[T1247](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1247/)**\nIntelligence (OSINT) Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to three Federal\nData Sets and Government webpages.

This targeting, scanning, and probing frequently leads\nto compromises at the hands of sophisticated cyber threat actors. In some cases, cyber threat actors\nhave used the same vulnerabilities to compromise multiple organizations across many sectors.\nOrganizations do not appear to be mitigating known vulnerabilities as quickly as cyber threat actors\nare exploiting them. CISA recently released an alert that highlighted the top 10 vulnerabilities routinely\nexploited by sophisticated foreign cyber threat actors from 2016 to 2019.[6]\n\nAdditionally, table 2 provides a list of notable compromises by Chinese MSS-affiliated actors within\nthe past 12 months.\n\n_Table 2: Significant CVEs targeted by Chinese MSS-affiliated actors in the last 12 months_\n\n**Vulnerability** **Observations**\n\n**CVE-2020-5902: F5** CISA has conducted incident response engagements at Federal\n**Big-IP vulnerability** Government and commercial entities where the threat actors exploited\n\nCVE-2020-5902.

For example, threat actors often\nleverage internet software repositories such as GitHub and Exploit-DB.[10,11] Both repositories are\ncommonly used for legitimate development and penetration testing and developing open-source\ncode, but cyber threat actors can also use them to find code to enable nefarious actions.\n\nDuring incident response activities, CISA frequently observed Chinese government-affiliated actors\nusing the open-source tools outlined in table 5.\n\n_Table 5: Common exploit tools CISA observed used by Chinese MSS-affiliated actors_\n\n**Tool** **Observations**\n\nCISA has observed the threat actors using Cobalt Strike to target commercial and\n\n**[Cobalt](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/)**\n\nFederal Government networks.

While this sort of activity is not a direct result of the exploitation\nof emergent vulnerabilities, it demonstrates that cyber threat actors can effectively use available\nopen-source information to accomplish their goals. Further, a threat actor does not require a high\ndegree of competence or sophistication to successfully carry out this kind of opportunistic attack.\n\n[CISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors using the Credential Access [TA0006] techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/)\nhighlighted in table 8.\n\n_Table 8: Credential access techniques observed by CISA_\n\n**MITRE ID** **Name** **Observation**\n\n**[T1003.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001/)** Operating System (OS) CISA observed the threat actors using Mimikatz in\n\nCredential Dumping: Local conjunction with coin miner protocols and software.\nSecurity Authority Subsystem The actors used Mimikatz to dump credentials from\nService (LSASS) Memory the OS using a variety of capabilities resident within\n\nthe tool.\n\n**[T1110.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/004)** Brute Force: Credential CISA observed what was likely a brute-force attack of\n\nStuffing a Remote Desktop Protocol on a public-facing server.\n\n#### Discovery\n\nAs with any cyber operation, cyber threat actors must be able to confirm that their target is online and\nvulnerable—there are a multitude of open-source scanning and reconnaissance tools available to\nthem to use for this purpose.

For example, “The Onion Router” (Tor) is often used by cyber\nthreat actors for anonymity and C2. Actor’s carefully choose proxy tools depending on their intended\nuse. These techniques are relatively low in complexity and enabled by commercially available tools,\nyet they are highly effective and often reliant upon existing vulnerabilities and readily available\nexploits.\n\n[CISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors using the Command and Control [TA0011]](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/)\ntechniques listed in table 11.\n\n_Table 11: Command and control techniques observed by CISA_\n\n|MITRE ID|Name|Observation|\n|---|---|---|\n|T1046|Network Service Scanning|CISA has observed suspicious network scanning activity for various ports at Federal Government entities.|\n\n|MITRE ID|Name|Observation|\n|---|---|---|\n|T1114|Email Collection|CISA observed the actors targeting CVE-2020-0688 to collect emails from the exchange servers found in Federal Government environments.|\n\n|MITRE ID|Name|Observation|\n|---|---|---|\n|T1090.002|Proxy: External Proxy|CISA observed activity from a network proxy tool to 221 unique Federal Government agency IP addresses.|\n|T1090.003|Proxy: Multi-hop Proxy|CISA observed activity from Tor that has resulted in confirmed compromises of internet-facing Federal Government agency systems.|\n|T1573.002|Encrypted Channel: Asymmetric Cryptography|CISA observed activity from Tor that has resulted in confirmed compromises of internet-facing Federal Government agency systems.|\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n## MITIGATIONS\n\nCISA asserts with high confidence that sophisticated cyber threat actors will continue to use opensource resources and tools to target networks with a low security posture. When sophisticated cyber\nthreat actors conduct operations against soft targets, it can negatively impact critical infrastructure,\nfederal, and state, local, tribal, territorial government networks, possibly resulting in loss of critical\ndata or personally identifiable information.\n\nCISA and the FBI recommend that organizations place an increased priority on patching the\nvulnerabilities routinely exploited by MSS-affiliated cyber actors. See table 12 for patch information on\nthe CVEs mentioned in this report.
