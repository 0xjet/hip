Instead, it required the URL to be passed as a command-line\nargument when the encryptor is executed.\n\nThis feature prevents researchers who find the sample from retrieving the URL as it's not\nincluded in the executable and only passed to the executable at run time.\n\nWhile the Hive Ransomware already requires a login name and password to access a\nvictim's Tor negotiation page, these credentials were previously stored in encryptor\nexecutable, making them easy to retrieve.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hive Tor ransom negotiation site**\nIn a [new Hive Linux encryptor found by Group-IB security researcher rivitna, the Hive](https://twitter.com/rivitna2/status/1507109201558003722)\noperation now requires the attacker to supply the user name and login password as a\ncommand-line argument when launching the malware.\n\n**Instructions to Hive ransomware affiliates**\n\n_Source: rivitna_\nBy copying BlackCat's tactics, the Hive ransomware operation has made it impossible to\nretrieve negotiation login credentials from Linux malware samples, with the credentials now\nonly available in ransom notes created during the attack.\n\n[Ransomware expert Michael Gillespie told BleepingComputer that the Windows](https://twitter.com/demonslay335)\nexecutables were also modified to require the credentials be passed as a command-line\nargument during encryption.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Rivitna also told BleepingComputer that Hive continued to copy BlackCat by porting their](https://twitter.com/rivitna2)\nLinux encryptor from Golang to the Rust programming language to make the ransomware\nsamples more efficient and harder to reverse engineer.\n\n\"Rust allows to get safer, fast, and efficient code, while code optimization complicates\nanalysis of Rust program,\" rivitna told BleepingComputer in a chat on Twitter.\n\nWith the encryption of VMware ESXi virtual machines a critical part of a successful attack,\nransomware operations are constantly evolving their code to not only be more efficient, but\nto keep the operations and negotiations secret.\n\nAs more businesses move to virtualization for their servers, we will continue to see\nransomware developers not only focus on Windows devices, but also create dedicated\nLinux encryptors targeting ESXi.\n\nDue to this, all security professionals and network admins need to pay close attention to\ntheir Linux servers to detect signs of attacks.\n\n_Update 3/30/22: Added information about changes to Windows encryptors._\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[National bank hit by ransomware trolls hackers with dick pics](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/national-bank-hit-by-ransomware-trolls-hackers-with-dick-pics/)\n\n[Beware: Onyx ransomware destroys files instead of encrypting them](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beware-onyx-ransomware-destroys-files-instead-of-encrypting-them/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - April 1st 2022 - 'I can fight with a keyboard'](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-april-1st-2022-i-can-fight-with-a-keyboard/)\n\n[Shutterfly services disrupted by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shutterfly-services-disrupted-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Encryptor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/encryptor/)\n[Hive](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hive/)\n[Linux](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/linux/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Virtual Machine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/virtual-machine/)\n[Vmware ESXi](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/vmware-esxi/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
