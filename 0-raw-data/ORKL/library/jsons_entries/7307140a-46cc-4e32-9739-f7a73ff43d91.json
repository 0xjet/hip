The report includes summary of victimized firms, Top 5 targeted countries\nand industrial sectors, status of dark web forum posts by ransomware operators, etc.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n\n-----\n\nOn May 13th, the notorious Russian hacking forum XSS banned all ransomware promoting\nposts and operators’ accounts. It was Darkside ransomware’s colonial pipeline infection that\ntriggered this incident.\n\nAs the U.S. government and FBI narrowed down the investigation, the Darkside ransomware\noperation server was taken down, and even the Russian hacking forums announced that\nthey are banning and deleting all the posts related to ransomware activity. Three biggest\nhacking forums, starting with XSS Forum, Exploit, and Raidforums, all halted ransomware\noperators’ activity, and of course, there were many disappointing posts from the ransomware\noperators regarding such decisions made by administrator. Most of active accounts such as\nREvil, Lockbit, and Avaddon have announced that they will either stop their activities in the\nforum or move out to their own independent platform.\n\nThen, where will they go? Let’s see what will happen after the consequence of banning\nransomware activity in all forums.\n\n## 1. Weekly Status\n\nA. Status of the victimized firms (5/17 ~ 5/24)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFor a week, a total of 67 victimized firms were mentioned and a change in the state of\nthe data leaked from the victims in the ransomware site was detected\n10 threat groups’ activities were detected\n\n## B. TOP 5 targeted countries\n\n\n-----\n\n1. United States — 44.6%\n2. Germany — 10.8%\n3. United Kingdoms — 6.2%\n4. Italy — 6.2%\n5. Australia — 4.6%\n\n## C. TOP 5 targeted industrial sectors\n\n1. Industrials — 13.8%\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Services — 12.3%\n3. Transportation — 10.8%\n4. Health Care — 7.7%\n5. Technology — 6.2%\n\n## 2. Status of active Ransomware forum posts @Dark Web\n\n A. XSS Forum\n\nOn May 13th, the administrator of the XSS Forum announced that ransomware-related\ncontent is no longer allowed. In particular, it will be limited to the following contents.\n```\n- Ransomware affiliate programs;- Ransomware rental;- sale of lockers (ransomware\nsoftware);\n\n```\nIn other words, ransomware affiliate program cannot be promoted for partner recruitment,\nand any forms of selling Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) or ransomware software itself is\nprohibited.\n\nObviously, the administrator’s announcement shocked the ransomware operators who were\ncurrently running. For example, the LockBit ransomware operator seems to have felt a kind\nof betrayal with the comment “Suddenly”.\n\n\n-----\n\nShortly after this announcement from XSS forum, the administrator of Exploit and\nRaidforums announced the same rules about banning ransomware-related posts.\n\n## B. Exploit & Raidforums\n\n2021.05.14 Raidforums posts that will not allow ransomware related content\n\n\n-----\n\n2021.05.15 Exploit forum posts that will not allow ransomware related content\n\n## 3. Ransomware operators’ next move\n\n A. Revil (Sodinokibi)\n\nDue to the change in the policy of the administrator of XSS forum, REvil also declared\nretirement in Exploit and will switch to a private platform\n\n## B. Babuk\n\nSource: Bleeping Computer ()\n\n\n-----\n\n2021.04.29 Bleeping computer reported that Babuk ransomware would close the\nBABUK project and release the source code to the outside by leaving a note titled\n‘Hello World 2’\n```\nI not so long ago wrote about the closure of babuk, yes, you all correctly understood\nbabuk as a RaaS will be closed, but it will live in its new understanding, we are a\npromoted brand with the best pentesters of dark netWe are a young project and\neveryone already knows about us, during this time we have gone ahead of other groups,\nwe respect other groups but not allBabuk changes direction, we no longer encrypt\ninformation on networks, we will get to you and take your data, we will notify you\nabout it if you do not get in touch we make an announcement.Also for other groups\nthat do not have their own blog or have but they want to exert additional pressure,\nyou can not be placed with us.We are open to offers in tox: ****Sanitized by S2W LAB\n\n```\nHowever just a day after, Babuk reappeared with a post titled ‘Hello World 3’ saying\nthat it will no longer focus on data encryption but rather exfiltrating data.\nIt also states that other ransomware groups either do not have a data leak site or have\nbut they want to exert additional pressure, shall not work with Babuk.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nHello! We announce the development of something really cool, a huge platform for\nindependent leaks, we have no rules and bosses, we will publish private products in a\nsingle information platform where we will post leaks of successful no-name teams that\ndo not have their own blogs and names, these are not girls who run with ship like\nrats and change the policy of their resources. these are really strong guys.Another\nloud leak awaits you within a week.\n\n```\nAfter that, in ‘Hello World 4’, Babuk is planning a huge platform for data leakage, and it\nis stated that ransomware groups that do not operate their own data leakage sites will\njoin together.\nA huge leak will happen very soon (they mentioned a week or soon)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMost of renowned hacking forums banned ransomware-related content, but the number of\nvictimized firms was not significantly reduced.\n\nOperators who have been kicked out of forums are likely to switch to their own platform and\nadditional ransomware groups that do not operate leak sites will likely join the crews.\n\nSuch sanctions against ransomware operators are just temporary, and this does not mean\nany termination or downfall of ransomware gangs, so we strongly recommend never let loose\nthe guard.\n\n\n-----",
