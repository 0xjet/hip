avoided\n\n**[ia.acs.org.au/article/2019/hospital-cyberattack-could-have-been-avoided.html](https://ia.acs.org.au/article/2019/hospital-cyberattack-could-have-been-avoided.html)**\n\nThe ransomware infection that recently crippled several Victorian hospitals could have been\navoided if the planned installation of artificial intelligence-based security software had\nhappened just a week earlier.\n\nThat software, from security vendor BlackBerry Cylance, was slated to have been installed in\nearly October but came too late to stop the September 30 breach – in which healthcare\nservices were interrupted after a ransomware attack shut down administrative systems in\n\n\n-----\n\nnearly a dozen regional centres.\n\nSecurity staff disconnected the systems from the Internet and scrambled to isolate the\nransomware, successfully ferreting out the malware using AI techniques that learn to\nrecognise malware based on its characteristics rather than checking against a database of\nknown attacks.\n\nAI has proved invaluable for Latrobe Regional Hospital (LRH), which like the other breached\nsites had to shut down numerous systems and was forced to transfer cancer patients to The\nAlfred in Melbourne for treatment.\n\n“We have gone through and cleaned all our hardware and now we are just rebuilding\nservices and systems and turning on other systems that weren’t impacted,” acting chief\n[executive Don McRae said during a recent update on the health service’s recovery efforts.](https://www.latrobevalleyexpress.com.au/story/6431038/lrhs-computers-on-the-mend/)\n\n“We found computers that still had the virus on it and [Cylance] shut it down very quickly.”\n\n**A state under siege**\n\nThe centralisation of IT security and service delivery, which in Victoria is managed by the\nDepartment of Premier and Cabinet (DPC), means that the planned rollout would likely have\nbeen part of a Department of Health and Human Services or even a whole-of-government\ndeployment.\n\nA DPC spokesperson wouldn’t comment on specific security tools but confirmed that the\naffected hospitals – which included sites across the South West Alliance of Rural Health\n(SWARH) and Gippsland Health Alliance – had restored “all critical systems”.\n\n[The government “does not pay ransoms to cyber criminals”, the spokesperson said in noting](https://www.vic.gov.au/update-cyber-attack-investigation)\nthe focused containment of the malware infection had seen “the best cyber minds from\ngovernment and private industry unite in response”.\n\nThe response – which involved excising the malware, wiping computers and restoring from\nbackups – was spearheaded by the Victorian Government Cyber Incident Response Service,\na crack team that [has handled over 600 cyberattacks on Victorian government organisations](https://www.vic.gov.au/cyber-health-incident)\nsince it was established just 15 months ago.\n\nThat’s more than one attack per day – highlighting the ongoing threat to Victorian healthcare\nand other government agencies from a constant barrage of attacks.\n\n[In October, the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) issued a formal warning about the](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/acsc-issues-national-alert-over-trojan-linked-to-vic-health-attack-532970)\n[Emotet malware and its payload of Ryuk ransomware – the strain believed to have caused](https://www.pulseitmagazine.com.au/australian-ehealth/5149-victorian-hospital-cyber-attack-thought-to-involve-ryuk-ransomware)\nthe September breaches.\n\n\n-----\n\nOutdated technology, poor security controls, the high value of healthcare data and a broad\nspectrum of user habits have left healthcare organisations suffering far more breaches than\nany other sector.\n\n[Australian healthcare organisations reported 206 data breaches in the first year of the](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/notifiable-data-breaches/notifiable-data-breaches-statistics/notifiable-data-breaches-scheme-12month-insights-report/)\nNotifiable Data Breach (NDB) legislation, with 90 incidents due to malicious or criminal\nattack.\n\n[That was in line with overseas experience: a recent review by security firm EmsiSoft, for one,](https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/34193/state-of-ransomware-in-the-u-s-2019-report-for-q1-to-q3/)\nidentified 491 ransomware attacks on healthcare providers in the first three quarters of this\nyear alone.\n\n**Cyber security still not an executive priority**\n\nVictoria’s susceptibility to cyberattack was a core concern of a recent Victorian AuditorGeneral [report, which tested Victorian health services’ security and found that all were](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/security-patients-hospital-data?section=)\nvulnerable to the theft or alteration of patient data.\n\nYet despite the state government’s ongoing efforts to improve cybersecurity response, a\nreview of health services’ recent annual reports found that cybersecurity is still not an\nexecutive priority.\n\n[Newly updated Statements of Priorities 2019-2020, which are released on 1 November each](https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/hospitals-and-health-services/funding-performance-accountability/statement-of-priorities/2019-20-statement-of-priorities)\nyear and reflect agreed priorities between Victorian public healthcare services and the\nMinister for Health– fail to mention cybersecurity at all.\n\nThe boilerplate statements are more concerned with clinical performance indicators and\nreferences to ‘data’ relate only to performance data and its submission to state authorities.\n\nThe words ‘cyber’ and ‘privacy’ do not appear at all – not even in the Statements of Priorities\n[lodged by malware-ravaged LRH and](https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/Api/downloadmedia/%7BFDDA7AC6-81AA-4196-ABF2-53BC81F8397E%7D) [South West Healthcare.](https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/Api/downloadmedia/%7B0F76F49D-1CA7-4C95-80DD-5131D39A4D54%7D)\n\nThe word ‘security’ is only referenced in the context of occupational violence – issues such\nas physical facility protection and installation of additional lighting in staff carparks.\n\nSimilarly, a casual review of health services’ annual reports confirmed that, despite years of\nwarnings from government auditors, Victoria’s health services executives remain either\nignorant of cybersecurity, or see it of so little import that it doesn’t merit a mention.\n\nGiven that those reports are otherwise detailed enough to even highlight improvements in\nthe efficiency of the washing of bedsheets, cybersecurity’s omission suggests that data\nprotection still faces an uphill battle.\n\n\n-----\n\nHealthcare isn t the only industry to struggle with this issue: a recent Thycotic-Sapio\n[Research study found a massive disconnect between business and cybersecurity priorities](https://www.cso.com.au/article/667336/disconnected-cisos-struggling-assert-security-relevance-business/)\nthat was marginalising information security executives and making them question their value\nto the organisation.\n\nDavid Braue\n\nDavid Braue is an award-winning technology journalist who has covered Australia’s\ntechnology industry since 1995.
