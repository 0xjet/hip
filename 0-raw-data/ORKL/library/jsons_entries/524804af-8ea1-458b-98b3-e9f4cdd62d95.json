Highly sensitive data about\nIranian APT groups was leaked, exposing abilities, strategies, and attack tools. The main medium for this leak was\na telegram channel.\n\nThe first leak uncovered attack frameworks and webshells of APT-34[1] (Known as OilRig group). This was followed\nby another leak that that exposed previously unknown details (such as compromised C2 servers) regarding the\noperation of MuddyWater[2]. Further, it detailed the modus operandi of RANA - a cyber division of the Iranian\nMinistry of Intelligence (MOIS).\n\n**However, Clearsky’s Threat Intelligence team investigation indicate that MuddyWater's activities were**\n**unaffected. This report will reveal the group's latest exploit usage and TTPs.**\n\nClearsky has detected new and advanced attack vector used by MuddyWater to target governmental entities and\nthe telecommunication sector. Notably, the TTP includes decoy documents exploiting CVE-2017-0199 as the first\nstage of the attack. This is followed by the second stage of the attack – communication with the hacked C2 servers\nand downloading a file infected with the macros.\n\nMuddyWater (aka SeedWorm/Temp.Zagros) is a high-profile Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor sponsored\nby Iran. The group was first observed in 2017, and since has operated multiple global espionage campaigns. With\nthat in mind, their most significant operations mainly focus on Middle Eastern and Middle Asian nations[3].\n\nThe group targets a wide gamut of sectors, including governmental, military, telecommunication, and academia.\nIn the past months, Clearsky had monitored and detected malicious files of each one of these TTPs - decoy\nMicrosoft software with embedded Macros[4]; and documents exploiting vulnerability CVE-2017-0199[5]. This is the\n**first time MuddyWater has used these two vectors in conjunction.**\n\nBy analyzing the Rana documents[6], it appears that\nthe MOIS attack teams are divided in to two\nbranches, each with different purposes.\n\nThe first is the espionage team that specialize with\nhacking systems, while the other is the social\nengineering team that compromises assets via social\nengineering and spear-phishing methods. Clearsky\nassessment is that MuddyWater is likely the latter\ngroup.\n\n1 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-group-exposes-iranian-apt-operations-and-members/\n2 https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-leaks-of-iranian-cyber-espionage-operations-hit-telegram-and-the-dark-web/\n\n3 https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-muddying-the-water-targeted-attacks-in-the-middle-east/\n4 https://www.clearskysec.com/muddywater-targets-kurdish-groups-turkish-orgs/\n5 https://twitter.com/ClearskySec/status/1118511605359304705\n6 https://www.clearskysec.com/iranian-apt-black-box/\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to Clearsky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Attack Vector 1 – malicious macro\n\nIt appears that in the recent campaign, the group returned to use (in certain cases) compromised servers. They\nleveraged the servers to host malicious code segment used in the second stage of the attacks; similar to previous\noperations. Concurrently we identified several files by MuddyWater that targeted various entities in Tajikistan\nwhile using the group's classic attack vector – a malicious VBA macro.\n\nWe were notified about one of the files by a colleague of us[7]. This file, named 'UNDP_TJK_Agreement_ORGS.doc',\nwas disguised as an official document of a UN development plan in Tajikistan.\n\nAfter opening the document, a VBS file is created. It is encoded with multiple VBE, JavaScript, and Base64 layers;\nsimilar to previous attack vectors by MuddyWater. The malware's second stage is downloaded from IP address\n185.244.149[.]218.\n\nMoreover, it appears MuddyWater hacked servers located in countries targeted by them. For example, Omri Segev\nMoyal, who recently joined Clearsky as a strategic advisor, identified the following compromised website uses by\nthe group – a website from Pakistan: hxxp://corplink[.]com[.]pk/wp-content/themes/buisson/16433.jpg\n\nThis address communicates with several malicious files, one of them is a file named 'Nayatel.server.docx' which\nimpersonating a Pakistani 'Fiber-to-the-Home' (FTTH) services provider:\n\n7 https://twitter.com/Timele9527\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to Clearsky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\nFurthermore, we identified a compromised server by MuddyWater in China: hxxps://bbs[.]kafan[.]cn/thread2150909-1-1.html\n\n##### Attack Vector 2 – CVE-2017-0199\n\nCVE-2017-0199 is a Microsoft Office allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted document, aka\n\"Microsoft Office/WordPad Remote Code Execution Vulnerability w/Windows API[8].\n\n##### Vulnerable versions\n\nMicrosoft Office 2007 SP3, Microsoft Office 2010 SP2, Microsoft Office 2013 SP1, Microsoft Office 2016,\n\nMicrosoft Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1\n\nMuddyWater has not used this TTP previously. In contrast, two years ago Palo Alto revealed that this penetration\nvector was used by another Iranian group named OilRig[9].\n\nFor example, recently a file was uploaded to VirusTotal that impersonated a document written in Russian. The\n**document was identical to previous ones we have seen.** In the known attack vector, the file communicates with\nIP address 185.185.25[.]175 on port 80. If the file receives positive indication from the server, the following\nredirections are carried out to the server[10].\n\n8 [https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0199](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0199)\n\n9 https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-group-steps-attacks-new-delivery-documents-new-injector-trojan/\n10 https://any.run/report/36ccae4dffc70249c79cd3156de1cd238af8f7a3e47dc90a1c33476cf97a77b0/3bf82792-2ba1-4823-a7d8-b8c8c792cf61#http\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to Clearsky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the redirection fails, like in previous files we detected, the user is redirected to Wikipedia instead:\n\nBelow is a screenshot from Shodan of the server. As seen, it still redirects to Wikipedia:\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to Clearsky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\nThe documents were\nidentified by only three\nantivirus engines. This is in\nstark comparison to a previous\nattack we reported on [11], in\nwhich the documents were\nidentified 32 times.\n\nMoreover, in May we\nreported on twitter about\nanother suspicious file that\ntargeted entities in Turkey, via\nthe same attack vector.\n\n**First type of file**\n\nIn the first stage, after the file is opened the following\nerror message appears.\n\nAfter the victim approves, another error message\nappears which requests the victim to recover the\ncontents of the document:\n\nIf the victim confirms, the vulnerability will activate, and the Word software will communicate to the C2 server:\n\nThe contents of the text file redirect to the malware's C2 server. Then, several communications are carried out to\nthe C2 server with the address hxxp://plet[.]dk/css/css.css:\n\n11 https://www.clearskysec.com/muddywater-targets-kurdish-groups-turkish-orgs\nhttps://www.clearskysec.com/muddywater-operations-in-lebanon-and-oman/\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to Clearsky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\nAs of June 1, the files on the server receives the value 0:\n\nAccording to URLhaus[12], the website is likely hacked:\n\nCurrently the domain's IP address is using Cloudflare service:\n\n12 https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to Clearsky Security Ltd\n\n|of June 1, the files on the server receives the value 0: ording to URLhaus12, the website is likely hacked:|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||||\n\n\n-----\n\nFurthermore, it is inaccessible and only shows a warning by Cloudflare about a malicious page.\n\n**Second type of file**\n\nThe second type of file exploits CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability, but unlike the first file, communication is carried out\ndirectly to servers used in previous MuddyWater's attacks (187.185.25[.]175(. We believe that in future attack\nMuddyWater will adopt vulnerability exploitation as a first stage.\n\nNote that this file also redirects to Wikipedia if it does not receive a reply from the server:\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to Clearsky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Malware analysis – RAT\n\nWe discovered a RAT file that communicates to the aforementioned IP address. The RAT was scanned on AnyRun\nby an unknown user in late May.\n\nFirst, the RAT is extracted with the PowerShell. Seen in the following image is its execution. Initially it\ncommunicates with the server, which activates a php script named 'game'.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to Clearsky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\nTo our understanding, this is an initial script which requests the compromised computer to report back to the\nattacker about processes running on the system. After receiving indication from the C2 server\n(hxxp://185.244.149[.]218/game.php), an encoded base64 output is sent to the attacker about these processes:\n\nAfterwards, similarly to other files attributed to files in this camgains, it sends dozens of communicates requests\nto its C2 server in order to receive commands. However, this sample did not receive any response from the server,\nand therefore no new actions were taken:\n\n##### MuddyWater impersonation entities \n\nLike previous attacks, most of the targets impersonate to entities in countries that surround Iran. They\nimpersonate in this campaign to the following actors:\n\n  - Kurdish groups (for example Komala – a Kurdish-Iranian party in Iraq).\n\n  - Actors connected to the Iraq government.\n\n  - Actors connected to the Tajikistan government.\n\n  - Actors connected to the Pakistan government.\n\n  - Actors connected to communication company in Pakistan.\n\n  - Unknown actors that are connected to India.\n\n  - Unknown actors in the UAE.\n\n  - Unknown actors in Cyprus.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to Clearsky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\n##### The combained attack vector\n\nWe identified several files that\nleverage both of the TTPs, presented\nabove.\n\nOpening the file leverages CVE2017-0199 and sends a request to\nthe hacked server.\n\nConcurrently, the aforementioned\nfiles are created. The file conducts\nseveral communication requests\nwith the compromised server in an\nattempt to download a JPG file that contains that malicious macro.\n\nIn our investigation, the C2 server communication failed; however, we detected a sample of this file on VT.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to Clearsky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\nDespite having the file extension 'JPG', it is in fact a Doc file embedded with the\nfollowing Macro. Similar to the first vector we described, the Macro executed an\nembedded Excel file via DCOMLaunch:\n\nIn a similar fashion to previous attacks, two files are created within the 'Temp' folder.\nThese files contain segments of the malicious code used to extract the POWERSTATS\nmalware:\n\n1. 'icon.ico' create \"Wscript.Shell\" Object and run WScript.Arguments.\n\n2. 'Picture.jpg' contains the malicious code of the second stage malware. It is encoded by multiple layers of\n\nobfuscated VBScript (VBE), JavaScript and PowerShell code.\n\n##### The contents of the documents\n\nThe documents can be categorized into two groups.\n\n**The first group**\n\nDocuments that resemble the previous documents used by MuddyWater. Some of these documents are almost\nexact copies in terms of content (while changing the attack method). Below is a comparison between them:\n\n**A document that exploits a macro code in order to communicate with the server (from the report Iranian APT**\n**MuddyWater Attack Infrastructure Targeting Kurdish Political Groups and Organizations in Turkey):**\n\n**A document from the current campaign that exploits the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability:**\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to Clearsky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth of them are disguised as official documents of the regional government of Kurdistan. Moreover, the new\ndocuments' OLE data is generic, while in previous attacks they contained fraudulent names.\n\n**The second group**\n\nDocuments written in English and disguised as unofficial documents from countries surrounding Iran (India and\nTajikistan for example). Unlike MuddyWater's known attack vectors, the content is not blurred, and has no request\nto click on 'Enable Content'.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to Clearsky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to Clearsky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Indicators of Compromise\n\nf5ef4a45e19da1b94c684a6c6d51b86aec622562c45d67cb5aab554f21eb9061\n\nd5b7a5ae4156676b37543a3183df497367429ae2d01ef33ebc357c4bdd9864c3\n\nd77d16c310cce09b872c91ca223b106f4b56572242ff5c4e756572070fac210f\n\n98f0f2c42f703bfbb96de87367866c3cced76d5a8812c4cbc18a2be3da382c95\n\n200c3d027b2d348b0633f8debbbab9f3efc465617727df9e3fdfa6ceac7d191b\n\n951585840a07a6496b0270f1028281fcb65d5b9e9a6ed613ca8809b258ed729f\n\n1dae45ea1f644c0a8e10c962d75fca1cedcfd39a88acef63869b7a5990c1c60b\n\n10157ab25bab7891068538111333a2101b987e930d5deb7bb60ed63cf7ca197d\n\n0a9d295016417b00457d4a031b5c52eea41bcde3465ac517767d8795a6a213eb\n\n20bf83bf516b12d991d38fdc014add8ad5db03907a55303f02d913db261393a9\n\ne2867e2255cad213fcc5752a7062882e92870c57\n\n8d1464e0cac7ea8f37e83fd142212c95db20fe77\n\n4fe389bc1ea85896b4ebb6fe26aa40a6e3f8e9ca\n\n592f0d9d7185eadab0509fdafdc305ab\n\n65978dd3d6b3a518f465676aa6bd876e\n\nbb6fda2cdc852112544d2598a784d04f\n\n6cb076f1f42573c5c43083a89bcfe442\n\nBEB6A4354549AE4F5579F25865EA8967\n\n66[.]219[.]22[.]235\n\n83[.]171[.]238[.]62\n\n185[.]185[.]25[.]175\n\n185[.]244[.]14[.]218\n\nhXXp://185[.]185[.]25[.]175/sDownloads/\n\nhXXp://185[.]185[.]25[.]175/upl[.]php\n\nhXXp://185[.]185[.]25[.]175/ref45[.]php\n\n**MISP event 1583**\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to Clearsky Security Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\nImages provided by pexels.com.
