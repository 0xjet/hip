The objective of the\nmalware appears to be to reprogram and sabotage these industrial processes. It is also one of the\nmost complex and carefully engineered worms ever seen. It takes advantage of at least four zeroday vulnerabilities[i], has seven different propagation processes and shows considerable\nsophistication in its exploitation of Siemens systems.\n\nThis White Paper summarizes the current known facts about the Stuxnet worm. It also summarizes\nthe actions that operators of SCADA and ICS systems can take to protect critical operations.\n\n#### What’s New in this Version\n\nThis document was previously titled “Analysis of Siemens WinCC / PCS7 Malware Attacks”. It has\nbeen changed to “Analysis of the Siemens WinCC / PCS7 “Stuxnet” Malware for Industrial Control\n_System Professionals”._\n\nThe following are the key changes in this version of the White Paper:\n\n        - Sections on what Stuxnet is, what it does and what the consequences are of being infected\nhave been completely rewritten in light of new information released by Ralph Langner,\nSymantec and others.\n\n        - Information on the spread of the malware has been updated.\n\n        - Vulnerable systems are revised to include unsupported and current versions of Windows\nincluding Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows\nServer 2008 and Windows 7.\n\n        - Analysis of the available Detection and Removal tools has been expanded.\n\n        - Patches for most (but not all) versions of the Windows operating system are available from\nMicrosoft for three of the vulnerabilities exploited by Stuxnet (MS08-067, MS10-046 and\nMS10-061). Two other vulnerabilities that allow escalation of privilege on Windows\nsystems were not patched at the time this White Paper was published.\n\n        - Workarounds for operating systems where no patches are available has been integrated\ninto a Prevention/Mitigation section that covers both patchable and non-patchable\nsystems.\n\n        - References to Siemens, US-CERT, Symantec and Microsoft have been updated\n\ni See the Frequently Asked Questions section for an explanation of zero-day vulnerabilities.\n\nOctober 14 2010 1\n\n\n-----\n\nTofino Security White Paper **Analysis Of Stuxnet Malware for ICS Professionals**\n\n#### Threat Details\n\n**What is it?**\n\n**Stuxnet is a computer worm designed to take advantage of a number of security vulnerabilities**\npresent in the Windows operating system and Siemens SIMATIC WinCC, PCS7 and S7 product\nlines. It is capable of infecting both unsupported and current versions of Windows including\nWindows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 and\nWindows 7. It also infects the Siemens STEP 7 project files in such a way that it automatically\nexecutes when the STEP 7 project is loaded by an uninfected Siemens system.\n\nStuxnet appears to be a targeted worm, designed to reprogram and sabotage one or more very\nspecific industrial processes. While there has been rampant speculation on Stuxnet’s intended\ntarget, no definitive victim has been identified.\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nStuxnet is one of the most complex and well-engineered worms ever seen. It takes advantage of at\nleast four zero-day vulnerabilities and shows considerable sophistication in its exploitation of\nSiemens systems.\n\nWhen installed on a computer, Stuxnet attempts to locate Siemens STEP 7 programming stations\nand infect these. If it succeeds, it replaces the STEP 7 DLL routines, so that any person viewing a\nPLC’s logic would not see any changes Stuxnet later makes to the PLC(s).\n\nStuxnet then looks for specific models of Siemens PLCs (6ES7-315-2 and 6ES7-417). If it is able to\nconnect to one of these two models, it “finger-prints” the PLC by checking for the existence of\nprocess configurations and certain strings in the PLC.\n\nIf Stuxnet finds what it is looking for in the PLC, it starts one of three sequences to inject STEP 7\ncode into the PLC. The PLC’s PROFIBUS driver is replaced and the main PLC program block\n(Organizational Block 1) and the primary watchdog block (Organizational Block 35) are significantly\nmodified. As well, depending on which sequence is selected, between 17 and 32 additional function\nblocks and data blocks are injected into the PLC.\n\nThe infected PLC now appears to wait for a specific event to occur, which it detects by monitoring a\nvariable. If that variable matches a specific value (0xDEADF007), then it significantly changes the\nexecuting process logic and prevents the original logic in the watchdog block from executing. How\nthis change in logic impacts the actual industrial process is unknown.\n\n**What are the potential consequences to SCADA and control systems?**\n\nThe objective of the malware appears to be to reprogram and sabotage one or more very specific\nindustrial systems. How it impacts the target industrial process is unknown, but it is probably\nsignificant and destructive.\n\nFor Siemens-based SCADA or ICS systems that are not the target system, the impact is less severe,\nbut not insignificant. Several Siemens users reported the virus would modify the communication\nconfiguration for the PLC's Ethernet ports or processors in offline project files. This could\npotentially cause loss of communications for the control system should these files be downloaded to\nthe PLCs in the field.\n\nStuxnet will not modify PLC logic where there is no Siemens product present. However it is\nimportant to note that any Windows-based system can be infected by this malware, regardless of\nwhether or not Siemens software is used.\n\n**How does it spread?**\n\nOf particular concern to the operators of ICS and SCADA system is the fact that Stuxnet infects its\nvictims using any one of three different propagation pathways:\n\n1. Via infected Removable USB Drives;\n\nOctober 14 2010 2\n\n\n-----\n\nTofino Security White Paper **Analysis Of Stuxnet Malware for ICS Professionals**\n\n2. Via Local Area Network communications and\n\n3. Via infected Siemens project files\n\nWithin these pathways, it takes advantage of seven independent mechanisms to spread to other\ncomputers. This complicates any attempts to control the spread of Stuxnet and requires a multitiered approach if security is to be effective.\n\nRemovable USB Drives Propagation:\n\n1. Infects computers via removable USB drives (even when AutoRun is disabled) via a\npreviously undiscovered shortcut (i.e. *.lnk file) vulnerability (MS10-046).\n\n2. Versions of Stuxnet created prior to March 2010 did not use the *.lnk file exploit, but\ninstead spread via removable USB drives using an AutoRun-based exploit.\n\nLocal Area Network Propagation:\n\n3. Spreads over local area networks to computers with network shares by enumerating all\nuser accounts of the computer and the domain. It then tries all available network resources\nin order to copy and execute on the remote share, thereby infecting the remote computer.\n\n4. Spreads over local area networks to computers offering print sharing via a Windows Print\nSpooler zero-day vulnerability (MS10-061).\n\n5. Spreads over local area networks via the Server Service Vulnerability (MS08-067).\n\n6. Infects computers running Siemens WinCC database software by using Siemens “internal”\nsystem passwords (that cannot be changed) to log into the SQL server, transfer a version of\nStuxnet and execute it locally.\n\nSiemens Project File Propagation:\n\n7. Propagates by copying itself to any discovered Siemens STEP 7 projects (*.S7P, *.MCP and\n*.TMP files) and then auto-executes whenever the user opens the infected project.\n\nStuxnet also has a separate P2P (peer-to-peer) networking system to automatically update all\ninstallations of the Stuxnet worm in the wild, even if they cannot connect back to the Internet.\n\n**WARNING: Disabling AutoRun DOES NOT prevent infection! Simply viewing an infected USB**\ndrive using Windows Explorer will infect your computer.\n\nThis diversity of propagation mechanisms means that “single-answer” security solutions will not\nprevent the worm from spreading. A multi-tier/multi-step “defense-in-depth” solution is needed in\norder to provide effective security. This is discussed further in the Prevention/Mitigation section.\n\n**How common is this malware?**\n\nThis malware is in the “wild” and probably has been for at least 20 months. According to analysts at\nMicrosoft, versions of the Stuxnet were first detected in March of 2009. Since then the worm has\nbeen under continued development, as the authors added additional components, encryption and\nexploits. It only came to public attention in late July 2010.\n\nAnalyzing the various malware tracking services such as Symantec and the Microsoft Malware\nProtection Center, it appears that there are approximately 100,000 infected hosts as of late\nSeptember, 2010. Symantec states that approximately 60% of the infected hosts are located in Iran.\nThey also report that 67% of the infected systems with Siemens STEP 7 software installed are\nlocated in Iran.\n\nOctober 14 2010 3\n\n\n-----\n\nTofino Security White Paper **Analysis Of Stuxnet Malware for ICS Professionals**\n\n##### Figure : Infected Hosts by Country (Courtesy of Symantec)\n\nAccording to the Siemens website, there are 15 known control systems that have been infected by\nthe Stuxnet malware. Based on reports from clients, and the Symantec data, we believe there are a\nnumber of other control systems that have been infected, but are either not aware of the infection or\nare not reporting the infection to Siemens.\n\n#### Affected Systems\n\n**What operating systems are affected?**\n\nBased on our analysis, we believe that statements such as “The virus affects operating systems\n_from XP and higher” are incorrect._\n\nOur list of vulnerable systems has been expanded to include all unsupported and current versions of\nWindows including Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows\nServer 2008 and Windows 7. Of particular importance are the Windows 2000 systems, as there are\nno patches for these systems.\n\nIt appears that Stuxnet will infect Windows NT machines, but will then abort.\n\n**What Control/SCADA Systems are affected?**\n\nThe following control and SCADA systems are believed to be directly affected by this malware:\n\n        - All Siemens HMI, SCADA or PCS7 systems based on the WinCC platform\n\n        - All Siemens systems using the STEP 7 programming software, particularly S7-300 or s7400 PLC products\n\nPlease note that Stuxnet will infect Windows-based computers on any control and SCADA system,\nregardless of whether or not it is a Siemens system; however, the malware will not attempt to make\nmodifications to controllers that are not S7-300 or s7-400 PLCs.\n\nOctober 14 2010 4\n\n\n-----\n\nTofino Security White Paper **Analysis Of Stuxnet Malware for ICS Professionals**\n\n#### Detection and Removal\n\n**Anti-virus products**\n\nAll major anti-virus vendors have released signatures to detect the presence of Stuxnet. Make\ncertain that you are using signatures from July 25, 2010 or later.\n\n**US-CERT primary Stuxnet indicators:**\n\nThe ICS-CERT has released an advisory listing primary Stuxnet indicators. Six are files that may be\npresent in infected machines regardless of whether Siemens WinCC/STEP 7 software is installed.\nAnother three are files that are changed in Siemens WinCC/STEP 7 system and project folders.\nDetails can be found at: http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICSA-10-272-01.pdf\n\n**Siemens solutions**\n\nSiemens is offering Sysclean, a tool from TrendMicro for detecting and removing the virus, for\ndownloading. It is available at: http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/43876783\n\nAccording to the ICS-CERT, the SysClean tool removes multiple malware components and restores\nthe affected DLL file necessary for the STEP 7 software to run. However our tests indicated that\nSysclean did not clear infected STEP 7 project files, making it possible that the malware could reinfect a cleaned system when an infected project file was accessed.\n\nThat said, Siemens also offers a SIMATIC Security Update (updated 18th August 2010) which\nperforms the following actions:\n\n1. Closes the Microsoft security hole by disabling icons if the Microsoft Security Update for\nthe *.lnk file vulnerability has not been installed.\n\n2. Enforces stricter SQL Server authentication settings.\n\n3. Scans WinCC and STEP 7 project data for Stuxnet infection.\n\nIt appears the combination of these two tools might remove all active instances of Stuxnet from a\ncomputer but this has not been confirmed.\n\n**Note 1: None of these tools remove from PLCs the function blocks which Stuxnet inserted into**\nthose PLCs.\n\n**Note 2: Siemens also makes the following statement on its web site:**\n\n_“The malware carries its own blocks (for example, DB890, FC1865, 1874) and tries to load_\n_them into the CPU and integrate them into the program sequence. If the above-mentioned_\n_blocks are already present, the malware does not infiltrate the user program.”_\n\nWe do not believe that checking for these blocks is a reliable test, as Stuxnet loads fake DLLs into\nthe Siemens programming stations, specifically to hide the existence of these blocks. Thus while the\nexistence of these blocks in a PLC indicates infection, the opposite does not hold true.\n\n#### Available Patches or Updates\n\nAs of Friday, October 8, 2010, patches for most (but not all) versions of the Windows operating\nsystem are available from Microsoft for three of the vulnerabilities exploited by Stuxnet (MS08067, MS10-046 and MS10-061). Two other vulnerabilities that allow escalation of privilege on\nWindows systems were not patched at this time.\n\nPatches to address the three above noted vulnerabilities are available from Microsoft for the\nfollowing operating systems:\n\n        - Windows XP Service Pack 3\n\n        - Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Service Pack 2\n\nOctober 14 2010 5\n\n\n-----\n\nTofino Security White Paper **Analysis Of Stuxnet Malware for ICS Professionals**\n\n        - Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2\n\n        - Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition Service Pack 2\n\n        - Windows Server 2003 with SP2 for Itanium-based Systems\n\n        - Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows Vista Service Pack 2\n\n        - Windows Vista x64 Edition Service Pack 1 and Windows Vista x64 Edition Service Pack 2\n\n        - Windows Server 2008 for 32-bit Systems and Windows Server 2008 for 32-bit Systems\nService Pack 2\n\n        - Windows Server 2008 for x64-based Systems and Windows Server 2008 for x64-based\nSystems Service Pack 2\n\n        - Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems and Windows Server 2008 for Itaniumbased Systems Service Pack 2\n\n        - Windows 7 for 32-bit Systems\n\n        - Windows 7 for x64-based Systems\n\n        - Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64-based Systems\n\n        - Windows Server 2008 R2 for Itanium-based Systems\n\nThese patches can be downloaded from:\n\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS08-067.mspx\n\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS10-046.mspx\n\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS10-061.mspx\n\nWe are unaware of any patches to address the Siemens STEP 7 project file exploits or to change the\ndefault WinCC SQL server passwords. However, the SIMATIC Security Update (updated 18th\nAugust 2010) does enforce stricter SQL Server authentication settings.\n\nFor those operating systems where no patches exist, there are a number of workarounds that we\ndescribe in the section below.\n\n#### Prevention/Mitigation\n\nAs noted earlier, Stuxnet is a complex worm with no single solution. As a result, this section is\ndivided into subsections dedicated to addressing each of the possible propagation vectors. Within\neach subsection is guidance for both supported systems (i.e. those that are patchable) and\nunsupported systems (i.e. those that are not patchable). The latter solutions are known as\n“Workarounds” and are configuration changes that will not correct the underlying issue, but will\nhelp block known attack vectors for systems where no patch is available.\n\n**General Infection Prevention:**\n\n**1.** **Anti-Virus / White List Installation**\n\n**Applicability: All Windows Operating Systems**\n\nWe recommend that that either anti-virus or white listing software be installed on all\npotentially vulnerable computers. Current versions of this type of software will prevent\nStuxnet infection and these tools work across most propagation methods.\n\n**Impact: Some anti-virus or white listing products may be incompatible with control system**\nproducts. Check with your PCS vendor as to whether such tools will cause malfunction of your\ncontrol products or affect your support status.\n\nOctober 14 2010 6\n\n\n-----\n\nTofino Security White Paper **Analysis Of Stuxnet Malware for ICS Professionals**\n\n**Removable USB Drive Propagation:**\n\nThe following patches, mitigations and workarounds help protect computers from infection via\nremovable USB drives (includes *.lnk file vulnerability (MS10-046) and AutoRun-based exploits).\n\n**2.** **Avoid using USB Drives in Control Systems**\n\n**Applicability: All Windows Operating Systems**\n\nIf possible, we recommend not installing any USB drives into any Windows systems,\nregardless of OS patch level or whether AutoRun has been disabled or not.\n\n**3.** **Prequalify all USB Drives**\n\n**Applicability: All Windows Operating Systems**\n\nIf USB drives must be used, prequalify them by first installing them in an isolated computer\nthat is fully patched and is running antivirus detection software with signatures capable of\ndetecting Stuxnet.\n\n**4.** **Disable Autorun for all USB Drives**\n\n**Applicability: All Windows Operating Systems**\n\nEarly versions of Stuxnet exploited the Autorun functionality to load from USB drives. To\nprevent this possibility, disable Autorun functionality as described in Microsoft document\n“How to disable the Autorun functionality in Windows”\n(http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967715).\n\n**5.** **Install Windows Patch for *.lnk file vulnerability**\n\n**Applicability:** Windows XP SP3, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server\n2008 and Windows 7\n\nInstall patch for the vulnerability as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-046 –\nCritical (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS10-046.mspx).\n\n**6.** **Disable the displaying of icons for shortcuts**\n\n**Applicability: Windows 2000, Windows XP SP2 or older and Windows Server 2003 SP1 or**\nolder\n\nThe Stuxnet *.lnk exploit will only execute if the .lnk files icons are displayed in a file browser.\nThus disabling the display of icons for shortcuts will reduce the chance of infection. To\nmanually disable the displaying of icons for shortcuts see Microsoft Support Knowledgebase\nArticle 2286198 (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2286198). A Fixit tool to do this\nautomatically is also available on this site.\n\n**Impact of workaround: When this workaround is implemented, shortcut files and Internet**\nExplorer shortcuts will no longer have an icon displayed. This may make viewing the Windows\nsystem difficult.\n\n**7.** **Disable the WebClient service**\n\n**Applicability: Windows 2000, Windows XP SP2 or older and Windows Server 2003 SP1 or**\nolder\n\nWhile Stuxnet does not use this vector, disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected\nsystems from other attempts to exploit this vulnerability. It does this by blocking a possible\nremote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client\nservice. After applying this workaround, it will still be possible for remote attackers who\nsuccessfully exploited this vulnerability to cause Microsoft Outlook to run programs located on\nthe targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for\nconfirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.\n\nOctober 14 2010 7\n\n\n-----\n\nTofino Security White Paper **Analysis Of Stuxnet Malware for ICS Professionals**\n\nTo disable the WebClient Service see Microsoft Support Knowledgebase Article 2286198\n(http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2286198).\n\n**Impact of workaround: When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed**\nAuthoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services\nthat explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be\nlogged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client\ncomputer. For most industrial control systems, this will have little affect on operations.\n\n**Local Area Network Propagation:**\n\nThe following patches, mitigations and workarounds help protect computers from infection over\nthe local area network via various network services vulnerabilities (Print Spooler Service\nvulnerability (MS10-061) and MS08-067 Windows Server Service vulnerability (MS08-067)).\n\n**8.** **Use a Firewall to block all TCP and UDP ports associated with RPC**\n\n**Applicability: All Windows Operating Systems**\n\nInstall a zone firewall between sub-systems to block UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445, and\nTCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593 and all ports above 1024 that are not specifically needed for\ncontrol system operations.\n\n**Impact of workaround: The Print Spooler Service uses the Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**\nprotocol, which is the same underlying protocol as OPC Classic (a popular SCADA integration\nprotocol). Thus this workaround can negatively impact critical OPC communications. Use of\nan appropriate OPC-aware industrial firewall to block all non-OPC RPC traffic will prevent\nthis problem from occurring.\n\n**9.** **Install Windows Patch for Print Spooler Service vulnerability**\n\n**Applicability:** Windows XP SP3, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server\n2008 and Windows 7\n\nInstall patch for the vulnerability as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-061 –\nCritical http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS10-061.mspx\n\n**10.** **Disable printer sharing**\n\n**Applicability: Windows 2000, Windows XP SP2 or older and Windows Server 2003 SP1 or**\nolder\n\nTo disable printer sharing on Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows 2003 systems,\nperform the following actions:\n\ni. Click Start, and then click Printer and Faxes.\n\nii. Right-click the printer icon and select Sharing.\n\niii. Select Do Not Share This Printer, and then click OK.\n\niv. Repeat this process for each printer shared on the system.\n\n**Impact of workaround: By disabling this feature, remote users will not be able to print to**\nthe shared printer.\n\n**11.** **Disable the Guest Account**\n\n**Applicability: Windows 2000 and Windows XP systems**\n\nOn Windows 2000 and XP, the guest account is enabled by default, which allows anonymous\nusers to access printer shares. On Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server\n2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, an attacker must be authenticated in order\nto exploit this vulnerability, unless password-based sharing is disabled. Note: If passwordbased sharing is disabled, attackers could exploit these systems without authentication.\n\nOctober 14 2010 8\n\n\n-----\n\nTofino Security White Paper **Analysis Of Stuxnet Malware for ICS Professionals**\n\n**Impact of workaround: Minimal for most industrial control systems**\n\n**12.** **Install Windows Patch for Server Services vulnerability**\n\n**Applicability: Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP (all Versions), Windows Server 2003 (SP1**\nand SP2), Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008\n\nInstall patch for vulnerability as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-067 – Critical\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS08-067.mspx\n\nThe reader will note that not all Stuxnet propagation methods have been addressed by the above\nPrevention/Mitigation steps. In particular, solutions to address the Siemens WinCC SQL database\npropagation, the Siemens S7 project file propagation and the P2P (peer-to-peer) networking system\nare still under investigation. As well, the two reported Escalation of Privilege exploits are still\nunpatchable and there is no known workaround.\n\n#### Actions Not Recommended\n\n**WARNING: While it might seem that one reasonable solution is to change the default passwords**\nfor the WINCCConnect account, this would impede communication between WinCC and the\ndatabase and is therefore not recommended.\n\n#### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**What is a shortcut?**\n\nA shortcut is a link to a file or program, represented by an icon. If you double-click a shortcut, the\nfile or program opens. The shortcut is a mechanism often used to keep frequently used files in a\nsingle, easily accessed location, such as a folder or the desktop. Shortcuts are implemented as files\nwith the .lnk extension.\n\n**What is Siemens WinCC/STEP 7/PCS7?**\n\nSiemens WinCC is a Human Machine Interface (HMI) application for the visualization and\nsupervision of process control and SCADA systems.\n\nSiemens STEP 7 is a family of software tools for configuration and programming of Siemens\nautomation systems.\n\nSiemens PCS7 is an integrated distributed control system comprised of various operator systems\n(WinCC), automation systems (S7-400 PLC), engineering systems (STEP 7) and other components.\n\n**What is a zero-day vulnerability?**\n\nZero-day vulnerabilities are those that are unpatched by the affected software’s manufacturer.
