    "plain_text": "# Quarterly Report: Incident Response trends in Summer 2020\n\n**[blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/09/CTIR-quarterly-trends-Q4-2020.html](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/09/CTIR-quarterly-trends-Q4-2020.html)**\n\n_By_ _[David Liebenberg and](https://twitter.com/chinahanddave?lang=en)_ _[Caitlin Huey.](https://twitter.com/hueylittle_er)_\n\nFor the fifth quarter in a row, Cisco Talos Incident Response (CTIR) observed ransomware\ndominating the threat landscape. Infections involved a wide variety of malware families\nincluding Ryuk, Maze, LockBit, and Netwalker, among others. In a continuation of trends\n[observed in last quarter’s report, these ransomware attacks have relied much less on](https://talosintelligence.com/resources/108)\ncommodity trojans such as Emotet and Trickbot. Interestingly, 66 percent of all ransomware\n[attacks this quarter involved red-teaming framework Cobalt Strike, suggesting that](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/06/indigodrop-maldocs-cobalt-strike.html)\nransomware actors are increasingly relying on the tool as they abandon commodity trojans.\nWe continued to see ransomware actors engage in data exfiltration and even observed the\nnew cartel formed by Maze and other ransomware operations in action.\n\nFor a more complete breakdown with more information, you can check out the full report\nsummary [here.](https://talosintelligence.com/resources/143)\n\n## Targeting\n\nActors targeted a broad range of verticals, including manufacturing, education, construction,\nfacility services, food and beverage, energy and utilities, financial services, healthcare,\nindustrial distribution, real estate, technology, and telecommunications. The top targeted\nvertical was manufacturing, a change from last quarter when the top targeted industries were\nhealth care and technology.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threats\n\nRansomware continued to comprise the majority of threats CTIR observed. In a break from\nprevious quarters, no one ransomware family was dominant this quarter. In the past, Ryuk\nwas much more prominent. In a continuation from last quarter, the majority of ransomware\nattacks were not observed in conjunction with commodity trojan infections. Part of the reason\nfor this could be an increase in the use of Cobalt Strike. Sixty-six percent of ransomware\nengagements this quarter involved the use of Cobalt Strike.\n\nFor example, an engineering company was infected with LockBit ransomware. The\nadversaries used Cobalt Strike for command and control (C2) purposes, with CTIR observing\ntraffic to a Cobalt Strike C2 every six minutes. The adversaries also used an open source\npost-compromise tool called “CrackMapExecWin,” which is designed to automate\nassessments of large Active Directory networks. This tool was executed on different network\nranges in the victim environment to have all the systems on those networks perform a forced\nGroup Policy update. The Group Policy included an XML file which set up a service that\nexecuted the ransomware from a client's compromised server. The adversaries created user\naccounts on compromised hosts and established remote desktop connections to targeted\nservers using their accounts. They also cleared event logs as a means of evasion. The\nadversaries also deployed TeamViewer, frequently used by actors to exfiltrate information.\n\nInterestingly, data from this attack was posted on a site Maze uses to publish their stolen\ndata, reflecting the fact that LockBit, along with other ransomware operations engaging in\nthese ransomware/data theft hybrid attacks, have joined together to share resources and\ndata.\n\nThere were also Remote Access Trojans (RATs), such as a financial services organization\nthat received a targeted phishing attempt with a maldoc containing a JavaScript RAT\nsubmitted via the organization’s ticket-handling system and web shells, including a\nmanufacturing organization that had their Telerik server exploited, after which the adversary\nthen deployed APSX .NET web shells.\n\n## Initial vectors\n\nFor the majority of engagements, definitively identifying an initial vector was difficult due to\nshortfalls in logging. However, in engagements in which the initial vector could be identified,\nor reasonably assumed, phishing remained the top infection vector. CTIR also observed an\nincrease in actors exploiting servers running the Telerik UI framework. The latest vulnerability\n[(CVE-2019-18935) allows for remote code execution. It is particularly dangerous because](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18935)\nthere are many ASP.NET applications that may run older versions of Telerik UI that leaves\n\n\n-----\n\nvictims exposed, even if the applications are patched themselves. In one instance, an\nadversary targeted a tech company via a server running Telerik UI. The adversary then ran\n“cmd.exe” and executed malicious commands culminating in a ransomware attack.\n\n## Top-observed MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n\nBelow is a list of the most common MITRE ATT&CK techniques observed in this quarter’s IR\nengagements. Given that some techniques can fall under multiple categories, we grouped\nthem under the most relevant category in which they were leveraged. This represents what\nCTIR observed most frequently and is not intended to be exhaustive.\n\n### Key Findings\n\nPhishes with malicious attachments were the top infection vector.\nSeveral open-source tools, such as Mimikatz; Windows utilities, such as PsExec; and\nred-team tools such as Cobalt Strike were commonly observed this quarter.\nEncoded PowerShell commands account for several execution techniques seen,\nillustrating the need for policies to limit unprivileged users from using PowerShell or\nCMD applications.\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) was a key technique used for lateral movement. This\nis a continuation of a trend seen last quarter around attacks against victim\norganization’s remote desktop services (RDS), possibly related to the increased threat\nsurface due to remote work stemming from COVID-19.\n\n### ATT&CK techniques\n\n**T1566.001 Phishing: Spear-phishing Attachment — Maldoc downloads Qakbot after**\nmacros are enabled.\n**T1053 Scheduled Task/Job — Executables create scheduled tasks on the system to**\nrun as the user account.\n**T1059.001 Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell — Executes**\nPowerShell code to retrieve information about the client's Active Directory environment.\n**T1021.001 Remote Desktop Protocol — Adversary connects to the system using**\nRDP with valid credentials.\n**T1070 Indicator Removal on Host — Remove files and artifacts from the infected**\nmachines.\n**T1132.001 Data Encoding: Standard Encoding — Use base64 to encode C2**\ncommunications.\n**T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact — Deploy Netwalker ransomware.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Software: Cobalt Strike — Qakbot associated IP addresses in CLOSE_WAIT status**\nto a known Cobalt Strike beacon IP.\n\n\n-----",
