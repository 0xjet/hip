Collected information included the PC's username, hardware and OS details,\nproxy settings, a list of current processes, if the infected host had RPC and SMB open file shares, and\nthe status of its RDP connection.\n\nThe collected information would have been able to tell the hackers what computer they infected, and later\ndecide if they'd want to deliver a second stage payload in the form of a more intrusive PowerShell script.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Redbanc incident is yet another example of how one worker clicking on the wrong link or running the\nwrong file can result in a major security breach, and how one hacked PC or laptop can lead to an entire\nnetwork getting compromised.\n\nPreviously, [according to an indictment by US authorities, Lazarus Group hackers have been accused of](https://www.zdnet.com/article/north-korea-s-apt38-hacking-group-behind-bank-heists-of-over-100-million/)\n[attempting to steal money from Banco de Chile, a local Chilean bank.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-crashed-a-bank-s-computers-while-attempting-a-swift-hack/)\n\n**Cybercrime and malware, 2019 predictions**\n\n## More cybersecurity news:\n\n\n-----",
