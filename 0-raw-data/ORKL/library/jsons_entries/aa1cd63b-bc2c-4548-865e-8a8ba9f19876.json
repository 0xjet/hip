Symantec\nhas identified a total of 11 organizations hit by the group, the majority of which are based in Saudi\nArabia. In at least two organizations, evidence suggests that the attackers gained domain adminlevel access.\n\n\"#Tortoiseshell group uses custom malware, off-the-shelf tools, #livingofftheland techniques to\ncompromise victims https://symc.ly/2lV4Ovn\"\n\nAnother notable element of this attack is that, on two of the compromised networks, several\nhundred computers were infected with malware. This is an unusually large number of computers\nto be compromised in a targeted attack. It is possible that the attackers were forced to infect\nmany machines before finding those that were of most interest to them.\n\nWe have seen Tortoiseshell activity as recently as July 2019.\n\n## Custom tools\n\n[The unique component used by Tortoiseshell is a malware called Backdoor.Syskit. This is a basic](https://www.symantec.com/content/symantec/english/en/security-center/writeup.html/2019-082613-5549-99)\nbackdoor that can download and execute additional tools and commands. The actors behind it\nhave developed it in both Delphi and .NET.\n\n\n-----\n\nBackdoor.Syskit is run with the -install parameter to install itself. There are a number of minor\nvariations of the backdoor, but the primary functionality is the following:\n\nreads config file: %Windir%\\temp\\rconfig.xml\nwrites Base64 encoding of AES encrypted (with key \"fromhere\") version of the data in the\n\"url\" element of the XML to:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\currentversion\\policies\\system\\Enablevmd\n\nThis contains the command and control (C&C) information.\n\nwrites Base64 encoding of AES encrypted (with key \"fromhere\") version of the \"result\"\nelement of the XML to:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\currentversion\\policies\\system\\Sendvmd\n\nThis holds the later portion of the URL to append to the C&C for sending information to it.\n\ndeletes the config file\n\nThe malware collects and sends the machine’s IP address, operating system name and version,\nand Mac address to the C&C server using the URL in the Sendvmd registry key mentioned\nabove. Data sent to the C&C server is Base64 encoded.\n\nThe backdoor can receive various commands:\n\n\"kill_me\":\nstops the dllhost service and deletes %Windir%\\temp\\bak.exe\n\"upload \"\ndownloads from the URL provided by the C&C server\n\"unzip\"\nuses PowerShell to unzip a specified file to a specified destination, or to run cmd.exe /c\n<received command>\n\n## Tools, techniques, and procedures\n\nThe other tools used by the group are public tools, and include:\n\nInfostealer/Sha.exe/Sha432.exe\nInfostealer/stereoversioncontrol.exe\nget-logon-history.ps1\n\nInfostealer/stereoversioncontrol.exe downloads a RAR file, as well as the get-logon-history.ps1\ntool. It runs several commands on the infected machine to gather information about it and also the\nFirefox data of all users of the machine. It then compresses this information before transferring it\nto a remote directory. Infostealer/Sha.exe/Sha432.exe operates in a similar manner, gathering\ninformation about the infected machine.\n\nWe also saw Tortoiseshell using other dumping tools and PowerShell backdoors.\n\nThe initial infection vector used by Tortoiseshell to get onto infected machines has not been\n\n\n-----\n\nshell (d9ac9c950e5495c9005b04843a40f01fa49d5fd49226cb5b03a055232ffc36f3). This\nindicates that the attackers likely compromised a web server, and then used this to deploy\nmalware onto the network.\n\n### This activity indicates the attackers had achieved domain admin level access on these\n networks, meaning they had access to all machines on the network.\n\nOnce on a victim computer, Tortoiseshell deploys several information gathering tools, like those\nmentioned above, and retrieves a range of information about the machine, such as IP\nconfiguration, running applications, system information, network connectivity etc.\n\nOn at least two victim networks, Tortoiseshell deployed its information gathering tools to the\nNetlogon folder on a domain controller. This results in the information gathering tools being\nexecuted automatically when a client computer logs into the domain. This activity indicates the\nattackers had achieved domain admin level access on these networks, meaning they had access\nto all machines on the network.\n\n## Presence of OilRig tools\n\nIn one victim organization, we also saw a tool called Poison Frog deployed one month prior to the\nTortoiseshell tools. Poison Frog is a backdoor and a variant of a tool called BondUpdater, which\nwas previously seen used in attacks on organizations in the Middle East. The tools were leaked\non Telegram in April this year and are associated with the group known as APT34, aka Oilrig.\n\nIt is unclear if the same actor deployed both the Poison Frog tool and the Tortoiseshell tools,\nhowever, given the gap in time between the two sets of tools being used, and without further\nevidence, the current assumption is that the activity is unrelated. If that is the case, this activity\ndemonstrates the interest from multiple attack groups in industries in this region. The Poison Frog\ntool also appears to have been leaked prior to deployment to this victim, so could be used by a\ngroup unrelated to APT34/Oilrig.\n\n## Attacker motives\n\nThe targeting of IT providers points strongly to these attacks being supply chain attacks, with the\nlikely end goal being to gain access to the networks of some of the IT providers’ customers.\nSupply chain attacks have been increasing in recent years, with a 78 percent increase in 2018, as\nwe covered in ISTR 24. Supply chain attacks, which exploit third-party services and software to\ncompromise a final target, take many forms, including hijacking software updates and injecting\nmalicious code into legitimate software.\n\nIT providers are an ideal target for attackers given their high level of access to their clients’\ncomputers. This access may give them the ability to send malicious software updates to target\nmachines, and may even provide them with remote access to customer machines. This provides\naccess to the victims’ networks without having to compromise the networks themselves, which\nmight not be possible if the intended victims have strong security infrastructure, and also reduces\nthe risk of the attack being discovered. The targeting of a third-party service provider also makes\nit harder to pinpoint who the attackers’ true intended targets were.\n\nThe customer profiles of the targeted IT companies are unknown but Tortoiseshell is not the first\n\n\n-----\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\nThe following protections are also in place to protect customers against Tortoiseshell activity:\n\n[Backdoor.Syskit](https://www.symantec.com/content/symantec/english/en/security-center/writeup.html/2019-082613-5549-99)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**SHA256** **Name**\n\nf71732f997c53fa45eef5c988697eb4aa62c8655d8f0be3268636fc23addd193 Backdoor.Syskit\n\n02a3296238a3d127a2e517f4949d31914c15d96726fb4902322c065153b364b2 Backdoor.Syskit\n\n07d123364d8d04e3fe0bfa4e0e23ddc7050ef039602ecd72baed70e6553c3ae4 Backdoor.Syskit\n\n**Backdoor.Syskit C&C servers**\n\n64.235.60.123\n\n64.235.39.45\n\n\n-----",
