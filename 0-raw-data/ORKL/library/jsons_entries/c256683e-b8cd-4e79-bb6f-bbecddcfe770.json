The company has been criticized for selling\nthese capabilities to **[authoritarian governments – an allegation it has consistently denied.](https://citizenlab.ca/2014/02/mapping-hacking-teams-untraceable-spyware/)**\n\nWhen the tables turned in July 2015, with Hacking Team itself **[suffering a damaging hack, the](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gvye3m/spy-tech-company-hacking-team-gets-hacked)**\nreported use of RCS by oppressive regimes was **[confirmed.

The first reports suggesting Hacking Team’s resumed operations\ncame six months later – a **[new sample of Hacking Team’s Mac spyware was apparently in the](https://reverse.put.as/2016/02/29/the-italian-morons-are-back-what-are-they-up-to-this-time/)**\nwild. A year after the breach, an investment by a company named Tablem Limited brought\nchanges to Hacking Team’s shareholder structure, with Tablem Limited taking 20% of Hacking\nTeam’s shareholding. Tablem Limited is officially based in Cyprus; however, recent news\nsuggests it has **[ties to Saudi Arabia.](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8xvzyp/hacking-team-investor-saudi-arabia)**\n\nHaving just concluded our research into another commercial spyware product, **[FinFisher, two](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/01/23/guide-makes-possible-peek-finfisher/)**\ninteresting events involving Hacking Team occurred in close succession – the report about\nHacking Team’s apparent financial recovery and our discovery of a new RCS variant in the wild\nwith a valid digital certificate.\n\n## The spyware lives on\n\nIn the early stages of this investigation, our friends from **[the Citizen Lab – who have a long](https://citizenlab.ca/)**\nrecord of keeping track of Hacking Team – provided us with valuable input that led to the\ndiscovery of a version of the spyware currently being used in the wild and signed with a\npreviously unseen valid digital certificate.\n\nOur further research uncovered several more samples of Hacking Team’s spyware created after\nthe 2015 hack, all being slightly modified compared to variants released before the source code\nleak.\n\nThe samples were compiled between September 2015 and October 2017. We have deemed\nthese compilation dates to be authentic, based on ESET telemetry data indicating the\nappearance of the samples in the wild within a few days of those dates.\n\nFurther analysis led us to conclude that all the samples can be traced back to a single group,\nrather than being isolated instances of diverse actors building their own versions from the leaked\nHacking Team source code.\n\nOne indicator supporting this is the sequence of digital certificates used to sign the samples –\nwe found six different certificates issued in succession. Four of the certificates were issued by\nThawte to four different companies, and two are personal certificates issued to Valeriano\nBedeschi (Hacking Team co-founder) and someone named Raffaele Carnacina, as shown in the\nfollowing table:\n\n\n-----\n\n|Valeriano Bedeschi|8/13/2015 – 8/16/2016|\n|---|---|\n|Raffaele Carnacina|9/11/2015 – 9/15/2016|\n|Megabit, OOO|6/8/2016 - 6/9/2017|\n|ADD Audit|6/20/2016 - 6/21/2017|\n|Media Lid|8/29/2016 - 8/30/2017|\n|Ziber Ltd|7/9/2017 - 7/10/2018|\n\n\nThe samples also have forged Manifest metadata – used to masquerade as a legitimate\napplication – in common, appearing as “Advanced SystemCare 9 (9.3.0.1121)”, “Toolwiz Care\n3.1.0.0” and “SlimDrivers (2.3.1.10)”.\n\nOur analysis further shows that the author(s) of the samples have been using VMProtect,\napparently in an effort to make their samples less prone to detection. This was also common\namong pre-leak Hacking Team spyware.\n\nThe connections among these samples alone could have originated with virtually any group repurposing the leaked Hacking Team source code or installer – as was the case with **Callisto**\n**Group in early 2016. We have, however, collected further evidence that ties these post-leak**\nsamples to Hacking Team’s developers themselves.\n\nThe versioning (which we accessed after overcoming VMProtect protection) observed in the\nanalyzed samples continues where Hacking Team left off before the breach, and follows the\nsame patterns. Hacking Team’s habit of compiling their payloads – named Scout and Soldier –\nconsecutively, and often on the same day, can also be seen across the newer samples.\n\nThe following table shows the compilation dates, versioning and certificate authorities of\nHacking Team Windows spyware samples seen between 2014 and 2017. Reuse of leaked\nsource code by Callisto Group is marked in red.\n\n**Compilation date Scout version Soldier version Certificate issued to**\n\n2014-11-27 1007 Open Source Developer, Muhammad Lee's\n\n2014-12-05 11 Open Source Developer, Muhammad Lee's\n\n2014-12-12 12 1008 **[Open Source Developer, meicun ge](https://citizenlab.ca/2015/03/hacking-team-reloaded-us-based-ethiopian-journalists-targeted-spyware/)**\n\n2015-03-19 1009 Open Source Developer, meicun ge\n\n2015-03-27 13 Open Source Developer, meicun ge\n\n**JULY 2015 LEAK**\n\n2015-09-04 15 Valeriano Bedeschi\n\n2015-10-19 16 1011 Raffaele Carnacina\n\n2016-01-05 13 SPC\n\n2016-01-18 17 Raffaele Carnacina\n\n2016-03-24 18 1012 Raffaele Carnacina\n\n2016-06-17 1014 Megabit, OOO\n\n2016-08-02 21 1016 Megabit, OOO\n\n|Compilation date|Scout version|Soldier version|Certificate issued to|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|2014-11-27||1007|Open Source Developer, Muhammad Lee's|\n|2014-12-05|11||Open Source Developer, Muhammad Lee's|\n|2014-12-12|12|1008|Open Source Developer, meicun ge|\n|2015-03-19||1009|Open Source Developer, meicun ge|\n|2015-03-27|13||Open Source Developer, meicun ge|\n|JULY 2015 LEAK||||\n|2015-09-04|15||Valeriano Bedeschi|\n|2015-10-19|16|1011|Raffaele Carnacina|\n|2016-01-05|13||SPC|\n|2016-01-18|17||Raffaele Carnacina|\n|2016-03-24|18|1012|Raffaele Carnacina|\n|2016-06-17||1014|Megabit, OOO|\n\n\n-----\n\n|2016-12-19|23|1018|ADD Audit|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|2017-01-31|24|1019|ADD Audit|\n|2017-04-28|25|1020|ADD Audit, Media Lid|\n|2017-06-28|27|1022|Media Lid, Ziber Ltd|\n|2017-10-09|28||Ziber Ltd|\n|2017-10-18||1025|Ziber Ltd|\n\n\nFurthermore, our research has confirmed that the changes introduced in the post-leak updates\nwere made in line with Hacking Team’s own coding style and are often found in places indicating\na deep familiarity with the code. It is highly improbable that some other actor – that is, other than\nthe original Hacking Team developer(s) – would make changes in exactly these places when\ncreating new versions from the leaked Hacking Team source code.\n\nOne of the subtle differences we spotted between the pre-leak and the post-leak samples is the\ndifference in Startup file size. Before the leak, the copied file was padded to occupy 4MB. In the\npost-leak samples, this file copy operation is padded to 6MB – most likely as a primitive\ndetection evasion technique.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 – Startup file size copy changed from 4 MB pre-leak to 6MB post-leak\n\n\nWe found further differences that fully convinced us of Hacking Team’s involvement. However,\nthe disclosure of these details could interfere with the future tracking of the group which is why\n\n\n-----\n\nThe functionality of the spyware largely overlaps with that in the leaked source code. Our\nanalysis so far has not confirmed the release of any significant update, as **[promised by Hacking](http://www.hackingteam.it/news/2015/07/13/statement-from-CEO.html)**\nTeam following the hack.\n\nAs for the distribution vector of the post-leak samples we analyzed, at least in two cases, we\ndetected the spyware in an executable file disguised as a PDF document (using multiple file\nextensions) attached to a spearphishing email. The names of the attached files contain strings\nlikely aimed to reduce suspicion when received by diplomats.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 – Investigation timeline\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur research lets us claim with high confidence that, with one obvious exception, the post-leak\nsamples we’ve analyzed are indeed the work of Hacking Team developers, and not the result of\nsource code reuse by unrelated actors, such as in the case of Callisto Group in 2016.\n\nAs of this writing, our systems have detected these new Hacking Team spyware samples in\nfourteen countries. We choose not to name the countries to prevent potentially incorrect\nattributions based on these detections, since the geo-location of the detections doesn’t\nnecessarily reveal anything about the origin of the attack.\n\n## IoCs\n\n**ESET detection names**\n\nTrojan.Win32/CrisisHT.F\n\nTrojan.Win32/CrisisHT.H\n\nTrojan.Win32/CrisisHT.E\n\nTrojan.Win32/CrisisHT.L\n\nTrojan.Win32/CrisisHT.J\n\nTrojan.Win32/Agent.ZMW\n\nTrojan.Win32/Agent.ZMX\n\nTrojan.Win32/Agent.ZMY\n\nTrojan.Win32/Agent.ZMZ\n\n**Samples signed by Ziber Ltd**\n\nThumbprint: 14 56 d8 a0 0d 8b e9 63 e2 22 4d 84 5b 12 e5 08 4e a0 b7 07\n\nSerial Number: 5e 15 20 5f 18 04 42 cc 6c 3c 0f 03 e1 a3 3d 9f\n\n\n-----\n\n2eebf9d864bef5e08e2e8abd93561322de2ab33b\n\n51506ed3392b9e59243312b0f798c898804913db\n\n61eda4847845f49689ae582391cd1e6a216a8fa3\n\n68ffd64b7534843ac2c66ed68f8b82a6ec81b3e8\n\n6fd86649c6ca3d2a0653fd0da724bada9b6a6540\n\n92439f659f14dac5b353b1684a4a4b848ecc70ef\n\na10ca5d8832bc2085592782bd140eb03cb31173a\n\na1c41f3dad59c9a1a126324a4612628fa174c45a\n\nb7229303d71b500157fa668cece7411628d196e2\n\neede2e3fa512a0b1ac8230156256fc7d4386eb24\n\n**C&Cs**\n\n149.154.153.223\n\n192.243.101.125\n\n180.235.133.23\n\n192.243.101.124\n\n95.110.167.74\n\n149.154.153.223\n\n**Samples signed by ADD Audit**\n\nThumbprint: 3e 19 ad 16 4d c1 03 37 53 26 36 c3 7c a4 c5 97 64 6f bc c8\n\nSerial Number: 4c 8e 3b 16 13 f7 35 42 f7 10 6f 27 20 94 eb 23\n\n**SHA-1 samples**\n\n341dbcb6d17a3bc7fa813367414b023309eb69c4\n\n86fad7c362a45097823220b77dcc30fb5671d6d4\n\n9dfc7e78892a9f18d2d15adbfa52cda379ddd963\n\ne8f6b7d10b90ad64f976c3bfb4c822cb1a3c34b2\n\n**C&Cs**\n\n188.166.244.225\n\n45.33.108.172\n\n178.79.186.40\n\n95.110.167.74\n\n173.236.149.166\n\n**Samples signed by Media Lid**\n\nThumbprint: 17 f3 b5 e1 aa 0b 95 21 a8 94 9b 1c 69 a2 25 32 f2 b2 e1 f5\n\nSerial Number: 2c e2 bd 0a d3 cf de 9e a7 3e ec 7c a3 04 00 da\n\n**SHA-1 samples**\n\n\n-----\n\n27f4287e1a5348714a308e9175fb9486d95815a2\n\n71a68c6140d066ca016efa9087d71f141e9e2806\n\ndc817f86c1282382a1c21f64700b79fcd064ae5c\n\n**SHA-1 samples**\n\n27f4287e1a5348714a308e9175fb9486d95815a2\n\n71a68c6140d066ca016efa9087d71f141e9e2806\n\ndc817f86c1282382a1c21f64700b79fcd064ae5c\n\n**C&Cs**\n\n188.226.170.222\n\n173.236.149.166\n\n**Samples signed by Megabit, OOO**\n\nThumbprint: 6d e3 a1 9d 00 1f 02 24 c1 c3 8b de fa 74 6f f2 3a aa 43 75\n\nSerial Number: 0f bc 30 db 12 7a 53 6c 34 d7 a0 fa 81 b4 81 93\n\n**SHA-1 samples**\n\n508f935344d95ffe9e7aedff726264a9b500b854\n\n7cc213a26f8df47ddd252365fadbb9cca611be20\n\n98a98bbb488b6a6737b12344b7db1acf0b92932a\n\ncd29b37272f8222e19089205975ac7798aac7487\n\nd21fe0171f662268ca87d4e142aedfbe6026680b\n\n5BF1742D540F08A187B571C3BF2AEB64F141C4AB\n\n854600B2E42BD45ACEA9A9114747864BE002BF0B\n\n**C&Cs**\n\n95.110.167.74\n\n188.226.170.222\n\n173.236.149.166\n\n46.165.236.62\n\n**Samples signed by Raffaele Carnacina**\n\nThumbprint: 8a 85 4f 99 2a 5f 20 53 07 f8 2d 45 93 89 af da 86 de 6c 41\n\nSerial Number: 08 44 8b d6 ee 91 05 ae 31 22 8e a5 fe 49 6f 63\n\n**SHA-1 samples**\n\n4ac42c9a479b34302e1199762459b5e775eec037\n\n2059e2a90744611c7764c3b1c7dcf673bb36f7ab\n\nb5fb3147b43b5fe66da4c50463037c638e99fb41\n\n9cd2ff4157e4028c58cef9372d3bb99b8f2077ec\n\n\n-----\n\ncc209f9456f0a2c5a17e2823bdb1654789fcadc8\n\n99c978219fe49e55441e11db0d1df4bda932e021\n\ne85c2eab4c9eea8d0c99e58199f313ca4e1d1735\n\n141d126d41f1a779dca69dd09640aa125afed15a\n\n**C&Cs**\n\n199.175.54.209\n\n199.175.54.228\n\n95.110.167.74\n\n**Samples signed by Valeriano Bedeschi**\n\nThumbprint: 44 a0 f7 f5 39 fc 0c 8b f6 7b cd b7 db 44 e4 f1 4c 68 80 d0\n\nSerial Number: 02 f1 75 66 ef 56 8d c0 6c 9a 37 9e a2 f4 fa ea\n\n**SHA-1 samples**\n\nbaa53ddba627f2c38b26298d348ca2e1a31be52e\n\n5690a51384661602cd796e53229872ff87ab8aa4\n\naa2a408fcaa5c86d2972150fc8dd3ad3422f807a\n\n83503513a76f82c8718fad763f63fcd349b8b7fc\n\n\n-----",
