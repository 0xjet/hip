Each of these three hacking groups had links to the**\n**Syrian government, including Syria’s Air Force Intelligence.**\n\nToday, we are sharing actions we’ve taken against four distinct groups of hackers in Pakistan\nand Syria over the past several months. To disrupt these malicious groups, we disabled their\naccounts, blocked their domains from being posted on our platform, shared information with\nour industry peers, security researchers and law enforcement, and alerted the people who\nwe believe were targeted by these hackers.\n\n[The group from Pakistan — known in the security industry as SideCopy — targeted people](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/07/sidecopy.html)\nwho were connected to the previous Afghan government, military, and law enforcement in\nKabul. In Syria, we removed three distinct hacker groups with links to the Syrian government.\n[The first network in Syria — known as the Syrian Electronic Army — targeted human rights](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/syrian-electronic-army)\nactivists, journalists and other groups opposing the ruling regime. We linked this activity to\nSyria’s Air Force Intelligence. The second network from Syria — known in the security\ncommunity as APT-C-37 — targeted people linked to the Free Syrian Army and former\n\n\n-----\n\nmilitary personnel who had since joined the opposition forces. Our investigation linked this\nactivity by APT-C-37 to what we believe is a separate unit in Syria’s Air Force Intelligence.\nFinally, the third network from Syria targeted minority groups, activists, opposition, Kurdish\njournalists, activists, members of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), and Syria Civil\nDefense or White Helmets, a volunteer-based humanitarian organization. Our investigation\nfound links between this activity and individuals associated with the Syrian government.\n\nMeta’s threat intelligence analysts and security experts work to find and stop a wide range of\n[threats including cyber espionage campaigns,](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/taking-action-against-hackers-in-china/) [influence operations and hacking of our](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/)\nplatform by nation-state actors and other groups. As part of these efforts, our teams routinely\ndisrupt adversary operations by disabling them, notifying users if they should take steps to\nprotect their accounts, sharing our findings publicly and continuing to improve the security of\nour products.\n\n**Here are the details on each disruption:**\n\n## 1. Pakistan\n\nIn August, we removed a group of hackers from Pakistan, known in the security industry as\n[SideCopy, that targeted people in Afghanistan, particularly those with links to the Afghan](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/07/sidecopy.html)\ngovernment, military and law enforcement in Kabul.Given the ongoing crisis and the\ngovernment collapse at the time, we moved quickly to complete the investigation and take\naction to protect people on our platform, share our findings with industry peers, law\nenforcement and researchers, and alert those who we believe were targeted. In addition, we\n[rolled out a number of security measures for people in Afghanistan to protect their Facebook](https://twitter.com/ngleicher/status/1428474001630785540)\naccounts.\n\nThis malicious activity had the hallmarks of a well-resourced and persistent operation while\nobfuscating who’s behind it. On our platform, this cyber espionage campaign ramped up\nbetween April and August of 2021 and manifested primarily in sharing links to malicious\nwebsites hosting malware.\n\nWe identified the following tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by this threat\nactor across the internet, including on our apps (threat indicators can be found at the end of\nthe report):\n\nThis group created fictitious personas — typically young women — as romantic lures to\nbuild trust with potential targets and trick them into clicking on phishing links or\ndownloading malicious chat applications.\nThey operated fake app stores and also compromised legitimate websites to host\nmalicious phishing pages to manipulate people into giving up their Facebook\ncredentials.\n\n\n-----\n\nSideCopy attempted to trick people into installing trojanized chat apps (i.e. they\ncontained malware that misled people about its true intent), including messengers\nposing as Viber and Signal, or custom-made Android apps that contained malware to\ncompromise devices. Among them were apps named HappyChat, HangOn, ChatOut,\nTrendBanter, SmartSnap, and TeleChat — some of which were in fact functioning chat\napplications.\n[These apps typically included two malware families: PJobRAT and a previously](https://blog.cyble.com/2021/06/22/android-application-disguised-as-dating-app-targets-indian-military-personnel/)\nunreported Android malware strain we are calling Mayhem. These two families have\nthe ability to retrieve people’s contact list, text messages, call logs, location information,\nmedia files on the device or connected external storage, and general device metadata.\nThey can also scrape content on the device’s screen via accessibility services.\nIn August, 2021, the group shifted to using bit[.]ly URL shortener links to mask the final\ndestination they were redirecting their targets to after they clicked on the malicious link.\n\n## 2. Syria\n\nIn October, we took down a hacking group, known in the security community as the Syrian\nElectronic Army (SEA) or APT-C-27, that targeted people in Syria, including humanitarian\norganizations, journalists and activists in Southern Syria, critics of the government, and\nindividuals associated with the anti-regime Free Syrian Army. Our investigation found that\nthis threat actor has been subsumed into the Syrian government forces in recent years, with\nthis latest activity linked to Syria’s Air Force Intelligence. On our platform, this campaign\nmanifested primarily in targeting people with social engineering tactics to trick them into\nclicking on links or downloading malicious software.\n\nWe identified the following TTPs used by this threat actor across the internet, including on\nour apps (threat indicators can be found at the end of the report):\n\nThis group shared phishing links to lead people to either websites hosting credential\nphishing pages or malware. The phishing campaigns were designed to manipulate their\ntargets into giving away their credentials to Facebook accounts.\n[They used a combination of commercially available (e.g., HWorm/njRAT for Windows)](https://blog.morphisec.com/hworm-houdini-aka-njrat)\nand custom-built malware families (e.g., HmzaRat Desktop for Windows and\n[SilverHawk aka HmzaRAT for Android). For example, they deployed Android malware](https://i.blackhat.com/eu-18/Wed-Dec-5/eu-18-DelRosso-Under-the-SEA.pdf)\nas part of trojanized applications, including those named the United Nations, VPN\nSecure and several popular chat apps like Telegram — all hosted on attackercontrolled websites.\nThis group also used new Android malware built with the open-source mobile app\ndevelopment tool Xamarin and, as of now, it’s only being detected by one anti-virus\nengine in public virus repositories. We found this malware in trojanized versions of\nTelegram and a Syrian news app, that are being distributed exclusively through\nphishing websites hosted on the Vercel cloud platform.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware families SEA relied on are capable of collecting a range of sensitive user\ninformation, once the device is compromised, including the ability to record audio and\nvideo, edit or retrieve files, call logs, address book, and text messages.\n\n## 3. Syria\n\nIn October, we took down a hacking group, known in the security community as APT-C-37,\nthat targeted people linked to the Free Syrian Army and former military personnel who had\nsince joined the opposition forces. Our investigation linked this activity by APT-C-37 to what\nwe believe is a separate unit in Syria’s Air Force Intelligence.This operation on our platform\ninvolved social engineering tactics to trick people into clicking on links to malicious websites\nhosting malware or credential phishing campaigns aimed at obtaining access to people’s\nFacebook accounts.\n\nWe identified the following TTPs used by this threat actor across the internet, including on\nour apps (threat indicators can be found at the end of the report):\n\nAPT-C-37 has continued to use commodity malware known as SandroRAT in addition\nto an Android malware family known as SSLove, likely developed in-house.\nThis group relied on social engineering to distribute malware to manipulate their targets\ninto visiting attacker-controlled websites. Some of these sites focused on content about\nIslam, others masqueraded as legitimate app stores or used look-alike domains posing\nas popular services, including Telegram, Facebook, YouTube, and WhatsApp.\nAPT-C-37 relied on Android malware with common malicious functionality to retrieve\nsensitive user data, including call logs, contact information, device information, user\naccounts, take photos, and retrieve attacker specified files.\n\n## 4. Syria\n\nWe took down a hacking group that targeted minority groups; activists; opposition in\nSouthern Syria, including in Sweida, Huran, Qunaitra and Daraa; Kurdish journalists,\nactivists in Northern Syria, including Kamishl, Kubbani, Manbij, and Al-Hasakah; members of\nthe People’s Protection Units (YPG); and Syria Civil Defense (the White Helmets, a\nvolunteer-based humanitarian organization). Our investigation found links between this\nactivity and individuals associated with the Syrian government. On our platform, this\noperation manifested primarily as social engineering and sharing links to malicious websites.\n\nWe identified the following TTPs used by this threat actor across the internet, including on\nour apps (threat indicators can be found at the end of the report):\n\nThis group shared links to attacker-controlled websites hosting Android malware\nmasquerading as apps and updates themed around the United Nations, White\nHelmets, YPG, Syrian satellite TV, COVID-19, WhatsApp and YouTube.\n\n\n-----\n\nLikely due to this operation s reliance on commercially available malware, this group\nhas not been separately tracked by the security community. While this likely limited\ntheir effectiveness thanks to the existing anti-virus detection aimed at these commodity\ntools, it has also perhaps allowed them to hide in the noise.\nAmong the commodity Android malware this group used: SpyNote and SpyMax.\n\n## Threat Indicators\n\n### 1.
