What makes these attacks interesting –**\n**aside from the tense current geopolitical situation in the region – is that they were carried out using new**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[The findings of our research will be �presented this week at the Virus Bulletin conference in Seattle.](https://www.virusbtn.com/conference/vb2014/abstracts/LM3-LipovskyCherepanov.xml)**\n\n**BlackEnergy is a trojan that has undergone significant functional changes since it was �first publicly�**\n**analyzed by Arbor Networks in 2007. Originally conceived as a relatively simple DDoS trojan it has evolved**\n**into a sophisticated piece of malware with a modular architecture, making it a suitable tool for sending**\n**spam and for online bank fraud, as well as for targeted attacks. BlackEnergy version 2, which featured**\n**[rootkit techniques, was documented by Dell SecureWorks in 2010. The targeted attacks recently](http://www.virusradar.com/en/glossary/rootkit)**\n**discovered are proof that the trojan is still alive and kicking in 2014.**\n\n**The latest variants of BlackEnergy are dated September 2014.**\n\n## BlackEnergy Lite: Less is more?\n\n**While the ‘regular’ BlackEnergy trojan is still actively circulating in the wild, we have discovered variants of**\n**the malware family, which are easily distinguishable from their older brothers.**\n\n**We nicknamed the BlackEnergy modifications – first spotted in the beginning of 2014 – as BlackEnergy�**\n**Lite, due to the absence of a kernel-mode driver component, less support for plug-ins, and an overall**\n**‘lighter’ footprint.**\n\n**Interestingly, the malware was named similarly by the malware writers themselves, as illustrated by the**\n**export directory of an early version of the main DLL:**\n\n**Note that even the ‘regular’ BlackEnergy samples detected this year have evolved in such a way that the**\n**kernel mode driver is only used for injecting the payload into user mode processes and no longer contains**\n**rootkit functionality for hiding objects in the system. The light versions go a step further by not using a**\n**driver at all. Instead, the main DLL is loaded using a more ‘polite’ and ‘official’ technique – by simply�**\n**[loading it via rundll32.exe. This evolution was previously mentioned in blog](http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002715.html)** **[posts by F-Secure.](http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002721.html)**\n\n**The omission of the kernel mode driver may appear as a step back in terms of malware complexity:**\n**however it is a growing trend in the malware landscape nowadays. The threats that were among the**\n**[highest-ranked malware in terms of technical sophistication (e.g., rootkits and bootkits, such as Rustock,](http://virusradar.com/en/glossary/rootkit)**\n**[Olmarik/TDL4, Rovnix, and others) a few years back are no longer as common.](http://www.eset.com/us/resources/white-papers/The_Evolution_of_TDL.pdf)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**developers now face, like Windows system driver signing requirements, UEFI Secure Boot – which will be**\n**[covered by Eugene Rodionov, Aleks Matrosov and David Harley in their VB2014 presentation Bootkits:](http://www.welivesecurity.com/author/rodionov/)**\n**past, present & future – to the simple fact that it is difficult and expensive to develop such malware. Also,�**\n**any bugs in the code have a bad habit of blue-screening the system. All the while, possibly even raising**\n**suspicion of the presence of malicious code rather than hiding it in the system.**\n\n**There are several other differences that separate BlackEnergy Lite from the ‘big’ BlackEnergy, in the plugin�**\n**framework, plugin storage, configuration format, and so forth.�**\n\n## BlackEnergy campaigns in 2014\n\n**The BlackEnergy malware family has served many purposes throughout its history, including DDoS attacks,**\n**spam distribution, and bank fraud. The malware variants that we have tracked in 2014 – both of**\n**BlackEnergy and of BlackEnergy Lite – have been used in targeted attacks. This fact is demonstrated both**\n**by the plugins used and the nature and targets of the spreading campaigns.**\n\n**The purpose of these plugins was mainly for network discovery and remote code execution and for**\n**collecting data off the targets’ hard drives.�**\n\n**We have observed over a hundred individual victims of these campaigns during our monitoring of the**\n**botnets. Approximately half of these victims are situated in Ukraine and half in Poland, and include a**\n**number of state organizations, various businesses, as well as targets which we were unable to identify.**\n\n**The spreading campaigns that we have observed have used either technical infection methods through**\n**exploitation of software vulnerabilities, social engineering through spear-phishing emails and decoy**\n**documents, or a combination of both.**\n\n**In April we discovered a document exploiting the** **[CVE-2014-1761](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1761)** **[vulnerability in Microsoft Word. This](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/2953095)**\n**[exploit has also been used in other attacks, including MiniDuke.](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/05/20/miniduke-still-duking/)**\n\n**In this case the successful execution of the exploit shellcode resulted in dropping two files to the�**\n**temporary directory: the malicious payload named “ WinWord.exe” and a decoy document named**\n**“Russian ambassadors to conquer world.doc”. These files were then opened using the�**\n\n**[kernel32.WinExec](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms687393(v=vs.85).aspx)** **function. The WinWord.exe payload served to extract and execute the BlackEnergy**\n**Lite dropper. The decoy document contained controversial but obviously bogus text as shown below:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**At the same time, another document appeared also exploiting CVE-2014-1761. The text was less**\n**controversial than the previous example, but still related to foreign relations.
