    "plain_text": "# Meta’s Adversarial Threat Report, First Quarter 2023\n\n**[about.fb.com/news/2023/05/metas-adversarial-threat-report-first-quarter-2023/](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/05/metas-adversarial-threat-report-first-quarter-2023/)**\n\nApril 7, 2022\n\nToday, as part of our [quarterly threat reporting, we’re sharing a number of security updates,](https://transparency.fb.com/metasecurity/)\nincluding our Q1 Adversarial Threat Report and insights into our work against malware\ncampaigns.\n\nOver the past five years, we’ve shared our findings about threats we detect and remove\nacross our technologies. In this threat report, we’re sharing information about six networks\n[we took down for violating our policies against coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) and](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/)\nthree cyber espionage operations we took action against. We have shared information about\nour findings with industry partners, researchers and policymakers. Here are the key insights\nfrom our first quarter 2023 Adversarial Threat Report:\n\n**We took action against three cyber espionage operations in South Asia. One was**\nlinked to a group of hackers known in the security industry as Bahamut APT (advanced\npersistent threat), one to the group known as Patchwork APT and another to the state-linked\nactors in Pakistan. Here is what stood out from our threat research:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Diversifying social engineering efforts: These APTs relied heavily on social**\nengineering and invested in making some of their fake accounts look like more varied\nand elaborate fictitious personas they created across the internet so they can withstand\nscrutiny by their targets, platforms and researchers. While we saw them continue using\ntraditional lures like women looking for a romantic connection, they also posed as\nrecruiters, journalists or military personnel.\n**Continued reliance on low-sophistication malware: This investment in social**\nengineering means that threat actors did not have to invest as much on the malware\nside. Our investigation into these APTs showed that cheaper, low-sophistication\nmalware can be effective in targeting people when used together with social\nengineering. In fact, for two of these operations, we observed a reduction in the\nmalicious capabilities in their apps, likely to ensure they can be published in official app\nstores.\n**Impact of public disruptions and threat reporting: In response to the security**\ncommunity continuing to disrupt these APTs, these groups have been forced to set up\nnew infrastructure, change tactics, and invest more in hiding and diversifying their\noperations in order to persist, which likely degraded their operations.\n\n**We also took down** **six covert influence operations for violating our policy against CIB.**\nThese unconnected networks originated in the United States, Venezuela, Iran, China,\nGeorgia, Burkina Faso and Togo. More than half of them targeted audiences outside of their\ncountries. We removed the majority of these operations before they were able to build\nauthentic audiences. Here is what stood out from our threat research:\n\n**Creating fictitious entities across the internet: In an attempt to build credibility,**\nnearly all of these operations invested in creating fake entities, including news media\norganizations, hacktivist groups and NGOs. They operated on many services, including\non Facebook, Twitter, Telegram, YouTube, Medium, TikTok, Blogspot, Reddit,\nWordPress, freelancer[.]com, hacking forums and their own websites.\n**Fake hacktivists from Iran: The operation from Iran posted claims of having hacked**\norganizations in Israel, Bahrain and France, including news media, logistics and\ntransport companies, educational institutions, an airport, a dating service and a\ngovernment institution. This is not the first time an Iran-origin operation claimed to have\nhacked government systems; a similar claim was promoted by another CIB network we\n[removed ahead of the 2020 US election.](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/removing-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-mexico-iran-myanmar/)\n**For-hire operations: As we** [called out in our past reporting, we continue to see for-hire](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/12/metas-2022-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-enforcements/)\norganizations behind covert influence operations globally, with half of the networks in\nthis report attributed to private entities. This includes an IT company in China, a\nmarketing firm in the United States and a political marketing consultancy in the Central\nAfrican Republic.\n\n\n-----\n\n**The evolution of China-origin operations: This report brings the total of the China-**\norigin CIB networks we removed since 2017 to six, with half of them reported in the last\nseven months. These latest takedowns signal a shift in the nature of the China-based\nCIB activity we’ve found with new threat actors, novel geographic targeting and new\nadversarial tactics. However, we continue to find and remove them before they are able\nto build their audience. These networks experimented with a range of tactics we\nhaven’t seen in China-based operations before, although we’ve observed them\nelsewhere over the years, including in operations linked to troll farms and marketing\nand PR firms. The latest behaviors included creating a front media company in the\nWest, hiring freelance writers around the world, offering to recruit protesters and coopting an NGO in Africa.\n\nWe know that adversarial threats will keep evolving in response to our enforcement and that\nnew malicious behaviors will emerge. We’ll continue to refine our enforcement and share our\nfindings publicly.\n\nWe are making progress in rooting out this abuse; it is an ongoing effort and we’re committed\nto continually improving to stay ahead.\n\n**_See the_** **_[full Adversarial Threat Report for more information.](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Meta-Quarterly-Adversarial-Threat-Report-Q1-2023.pdf)_**\n\nDownloads\n[Meta's Adversarial Threat Report, Q1 2023](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Meta-Quarterly-Adversarial-Threat-Report-Q1-2023.pdf)\n\n\n-----",
