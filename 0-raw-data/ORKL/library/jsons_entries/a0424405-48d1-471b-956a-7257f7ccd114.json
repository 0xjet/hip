While these attacks garnered public](http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/02/20/how-the-syrian-electronic-army-hacked-us-a-detailed-timeline/)\nattention, the activities of another group - The Syrian Malware Team - have gone largely\nunnoticed. The group’s activities prompted us to take a closer look. We discovered this group\nusing a .NET based RAT called BlackWorm to infiltrate their targets.\n\nThe Syrian Malware Team is largely pro-Syrian government, as seen in one of their banners\nfeaturing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Based on the sentiments publicly expressed by\nthis group it is likely that they are either directly or indirectly involved with the Syrian\ngovernment. Further certain members of the Syrian Malware Team have ties to the Syrian\n[Electronic army (SEA) known to be linked to the Syrian government. This indicates that the](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Electronic_Army)\nSyrian Malware Team may also be possibly an offshoot or part of the SEA.\n\n\n-----\n\nBanner used by the Syrian Malware Team\n\n## BlackWorm Authorship\n\nWe found at least two distinct versions of the BlackWorm tool, including an original/private\nversion (v0.3.0) and the Dark Edition (v2.1). The original BlackWorm builder was co-authored\nby Naser Al Mutairi from Kuwait, better known by his online moniker 'njq8'. He is also known\nto have coded njw0rm, [njRAT/LV, and earlier versions of H-worm/Houdini. We found his code](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2012/09/the-story-behind-backdoorlv.html)\nbeing used in a slew of other RATs such as Fallaga and Spygate. BlackWorm v0.3.0 was\nalso co-authored by another actor, Black Mafia.\n\nAbout section within the original version of BlackWorm builder\n\nWithin the underground development forums, it’s common for threat actors to collaborate on\ntoolsets. Some write the base tools that other attackers can use; others modify and enhance\nexisting tools.\n\nThe BlackWorm builder v2.1 is a prime example of actors modifying and enhancing current\nRATs. After njq8 and Black Mafia created the original builder, another author, Black.Hacker,\nenhanced its feature set.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout section within BlackWorm Dark Edition builder\n\nBlack.Hacker's banner on social media\n\nAs an interesting side note, 'njq8' took down his blog in recent months and announced a\ncease in all malware development activity on his Twitter and Facebook account, urging\nothers to stop as well. This is likely a direct result of the lawsuit filed against him by\nMicrosoft.\n\n## BlackWorm RAT Features\n\nThe builder for BlackWorm v0.3.0 is fairly simple and allows for very quick payload, but\ndoesn’t allow any configuration other than the IP address for command and control (C2).\n\nBuilding binary through BlackWorm v0.3.0\n\n\n-----\n\nBlackWorm v0.3.0 controller\n\nBlackWorm v0.3.0 supports the following commands between the controller and the implant:\n\nping Checks if victim is online\n\ncloseserver Exits the implant\n\nrestartserver Restarts the implant\n\nsendfile Transfer and run file from server\n\ndownload Download and run file from URL\n\nddos Ping flood target\n\nmsgbox Message interaction with victim\n\ndown Kill critical windows processes\n\nblocker Block specified website by pointing resolution to 127.0.0.1\n\nlogoff Logout out of windows\n\nrestart Restart system\n\nshutdown Shutdown system\n\nmore Disable task manager, registry tools, system restore. Also blocks keyboard\nand mouse input\n\nhror Displays a startling flash video\n\nIn addition to the features supported by the command structure, the payload can:\n\nSeek and kill no-ip processes DUC30 and DUC20\nDisable Task Manager to kill process dialog\nCopy itself to USB drives and create autorun entries\nCopy itself to common peer-to-peer (P2P) share locations\n\n\n-----\n\nCollect system information such as OS, username, hostname, presence of camera,\nactive window name, etc., to display in the controller\nKill the following analysis processes (if found):\n\nprocexp\nSbieCtrl\nSpyTheSpy\nSpeedGear\nWireshark\nMBAM\nApateDNS\nIPBlocker\ncPorts\nProcessHacker\nAntiLogger\n\nThe Syrian Malware Team primarily uses another version of BlackWorm called the Dark\nEdition (v2.1). BlackWorm v2.1 was released on a prolific underground forum where\ninformation and code is often shared, traded and sold.\n\nBlackWorm v2.1 has the same abilities as the original version and additional functionality,\nincluding bypassing UAC, disabling host firewalls and spreading over network shares. Unlike\nits predecessor, it also allows for granular control of the features available within the RAT.\nThese additional controls allow the RAT user to enable and disable features as needed.\nBinary output can be also be generated in multiple formats, such as .exe, .src and .dll.\n\n\n-----\n\nBlackWorm Dark Edition builder\n\n## Syrian Malware Team\n\nWe observed activity from the Syrian Malware Team going as far back as Jan. 1, 2011.\nBased on Facebook posts, they are allegedly directly or indirectly involved with the Syrian\ngovernment. Their Facebook page shows they are still very active, with a post as recent as\nJuly 16, 2014.th\n\n\n-----\n\nSyrian Malware Team s Facebook page\n\nThe Syrian Malware Team has been involved in everything from profiling targets to\norchestrating attacks themselves. There are seemingly multiple members, including:\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/hawk.syrian.9](https://www.facebook.com/hawk.syrian.9)\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/kays.syr](https://www.facebook.com/kays.syr)\n\nPartial list of self-proclaimed Syrian Malware Team members\n\nSome of these people have posted malware-related items on Facebook.\n\nFacebook posting of virus scanning of files\n\nWhile looking for Dark Edition samples, we discovered a binary named svchost.exe (MD5:\n015c51e11e314ff99b1487d92a1ba09b). We quickly saw indicators that it was created by\nBlackWorm Dark Edition.\n\nConfiguration options within code\n\nThe malware communicated out to 178.44.115.196, over port 5050, with a command\nstructure of:\n\n\n-----\n\n!0/j|n\\12121212_64F3BF1F/j|n\\{Hostname}/j|n\\{Username}/j|n\\USA/j|n\\Win 7 Professional\nSP1 x86/j|n\\No/j|n\\2.4.0 [ Dark Edition]/j|n\\/j|n\\{ActiveWindowName}/j|n\\[endof]\n\nWhen looking at samples of Dark Edition BlackWorm being used by the Syrian Malware\n[Team, the strings “Syrian Malware,” or “Syrian Malware Team” are often used in the C2](http://syrianmalware.com/files/Attack.m.exe%20-%20Report.pdf)\ncommunications or within the binary strings.\n\nAdditional pivoting off of svchost.exe brought us to three additional samples apparently built\nwith BlackWorm Dark Edition. E.exe, (MD5: a8cf815c3800202d448d035300985dc7) a binary\nthat drew our attention, looked to be a backdoor with the Syrian Malware strings within it.\n\nWhen executed, the binary beacons to aliallosh.sytes.net on port 1177. This C2 has been\nseen in multiple malware runs often associated with Syria. The command structure of the\nbinary is:\n\n!0/j|n\\Syrian Malware/j|n\\{Hostname}/j|n\\{Username}/j|n\\USA/j|n\\Win 7 Professional SP1\nx86/j|n\\No/j|n\n\n\\0.1/j|n\\/j|n\\{ActiveWindowName}/j|n\\[endof]\n\nFinally, pivoting to another sample, 1gpj.srcRania\n(MD5:f99c15c62a5d981ffac5fdb611e13095), the same strings were present. The string\n[\"Rania\" used as a lure was in Arabic and likely refers to the prolific Queen Rania of Jordan.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Rania_of_Jordan)\n\nThe traffic is nearly identical to the other samples we identified and tied to the Syrian\nMalware Team.\n\n\n-----\n\n!1/j|n\\C:\\Documents and Settings\\{Username}\\Local Settings\\Application\nDataldoDrZdpkK.jpg - Windows Internet Explorer[endof]!0/j|n\\Syrian Malware/j|n\\\n{Hostname}/j|n\\{Username}/j|n\\USA/j|n\\Win XP ProfessionalSP2\nx86/j|n\\No/j|n\\0.1/j|n\\/j|n\\C:\\Documents and Settings\\{Username}\\Local Settings\\Application\nDataldoDrZdpkK.jpg - {ActiveWindowName}/j|n\\[endof]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDetermining which groups use which malware is often very difficult. Connecting the dots\nbetween actors and malware typically involves looking at binary code, identifying related\nmalware examples associated with those binaries, and reviewing infection vectors, among\nother things.\n\nThis blog presents a prime example of the process of attribution. We connected a builder\nwith malware samples and the actors/developers behind these attacks. This type of\nattribution is key to creating actionable threat intelligence to help proactively protect\norganizations.\n\nPrevious Post\nNext Post\n\n\n-----",
