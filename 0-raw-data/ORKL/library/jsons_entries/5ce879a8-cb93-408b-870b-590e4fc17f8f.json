Based on comprehensive reporting, it is also [likely that](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/08/apt41-dual-espionage-and-cyber-crime-operation.html)\nAPT41 has an operational scope to track individuals and conduct\nsurveillance of media entities. The New York Times [suggests](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/technology/chinese-hackers-infiltrate-new-york-times-computers.html?pagewanted=all)\nthe timing of the 2013 APT12 attack coincided with reporting\non Chinese leadership figures, pointing to a potential flashpoint.\n\nThe majority of the observed exfiltration activity coincided\nwith [reports in The Economic Times of a US Navy “freedom](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/in-unusual-move-us-conducts-freedom-patrol-in-indian-eez/articleshow/81980800.cms)\npatrol” in the Indian Ocean. The Economic Times (a subsidiary\n[of The Times Group) published 2 articles on its “​​India China](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/India-China-war)\n[war” subsection just days before Insikt Group detected the](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/India-China-war)\ninitial intrusion activity targeting BCCL. Both of the articles,\nshown in figures 3 and 4, as well as more recently [published](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/view-india-should-expect-intermittent-border-clashes/articleshow/84545871.cms)\npieces, could be viewed as being antagonistic towards the\nChinese government. While the timing of the initial intrusion\nand exfiltration activity coinciding with notable naval-related\narticles is circumstantial evidence of possible intent, it remains\nplausible that TAG-28’s objectives may have included targeting\nthe media group to garner insight into Indian ocean naval matters\nor perceived anti-China reporting.\n\n\n_[Figure 4: View: China, Turkey and Pakistan’s unholy nuclear nexus and its global](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/view-china-turkey-and-pakistans-unholy-nuclear-nexus-and-its-global-ramifications/articleshow/80579631.cms)_\n_[ramifications: this article calls out China’s nuclear relationships with Turkey and Pakistan](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/view-china-turkey-and-pakistans-unholy-nuclear-nexus-and-its-global-ramifications/articleshow/80579631.cms)_\n_as a serious threat to global security and calls for strong punitive measures against Beijing._\n_The article also cites that in February 2020, the Indian Navy intercepted a ship destined for_\n_Pakistan from China with hardware believed to be used for nuclear industries.

(Source: India Times)](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/view-china-turkey-and-pakistans-unholy-nuclear-nexus-and-its-global-ramifications/articleshow/80579631.cms)_\n\n##### Targeting of the Unique Identification Authority of India\n\nWhile investigating the infrastructure used in the BCCL\ncompromise, we identified an ongoing compromise of the UIDAI,\nwhich oversees India’s Aadhaar ID card system. Between June\n10 and at least July 20, 2021, 2 IPs registered to UIDAI were\nobserved communicating with the same suspected Cobalt Strike\nC2 server used to target BCCL, 178.157.91[.]144. Data transfer\nsizes were comparatively modest from the UIDAI network based\non our visibility. Less than 10 MB of data was egressed with an\ningress of almost 30 MB, possibly indicating the deployment of\nadditional malicious tooling from the attacker infrastructure.\n\nUIDAI is the Indian government agency responsible for the\nAadhaar national identification database. It contains private,\nidentifying, and biometric information for over 1 billion Indian\n[citizens. Some view the Aadhaar database as controversial: the](https://www.huffpost.com/archive/in/entry/uidai-s-aadhaar-software-hacked-id-database-compromised-experts-confirm_a_23522472)\nsheer amount of personal data held by the system makes it an\nattractive target to both nation-state and criminally motivated\n[adversaries. The Aadhaar system has a history (1, 2, 3) of data](https://www.huffpost.com/archive/in/entry/uidai-s-aadhaar-software-hacked-id-database-compromised-experts-confirm_a_23522472)\nleaks and compromise, including [rogue software exploiting](https://www.huffpost.com/archive/in/entry/uidai-s-aadhaar-software-hacked-id-database-compromised-experts-confirm_a_23522472)\nthe system to create false identity cards and an unsecured\napplication programming interface (API) giving complete visibility\nof the database.\n\n\n-----\n\nTAG-28 likely targeted UIDAI due to its ownership of the\nAadhaar database. Large PII data sets are valuable to both nationstate and criminal threat actors for multiple purposes, including\nfor potentially identifying high-value intelligence targets such as\ngovernment officials, enabling surveillance, conducting social\nengineering attacks, or enriching other data sources.\n\n##### Targeting of Madhya Pradesh Police\n\nUsing Recorded Future NTA data, we [identified a Madhya](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/1KrdOaxnpi4e)\nPradesh Police (MPP) IP communicating with Winnti C2 IP\n185.161.209[.]87 over port 80 on June 1, 2021. The MPP IP serves\na State Crime Records Bureau (SCRB) website (scrbofficial.\nmppolice.gov[.]in), which provides links to various web and\nmobile applications operated by SCRB. Insikt Group later\nobserved additional network activity between another SCRB IP,\n210.212.145[.]100, and 185.161.209[.]87, starting July 27 to at\nleast August 9, 2021. Based on limited visibility, we observed\nless than 5 MB of data transfer between the MPP and the Winnti\nserver during the considered time frame.\n\nMadhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was\n[critical of China after the](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mp-chief-minister-shivraj-singh-chouhan-calls-upon-people-to-boycott-chinese-products/article31875590.ece) [violent border clashes with Chinese](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indian-army-says-20-soldiers-killed-in-clash-with-chinese-troops-in-the-galwan-area/article31845662.ece)\n[troops in the Ladakh region in June 2020, calling for the state’s](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mp-chief-minister-shivraj-singh-chouhan-calls-upon-people-to-boycott-chinese-products/article31875590.ece)\nresidents to boycott Chinese products. Citizens and news outlets\n[were quick to point out a 2016 tweet in which Chouhan compared](https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/amid-stand-off-with-china-shivrajs-old-tweet-comparing-bjp-and-communist-party-of-china-goes-viral)\nIndia’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to the Chinese\nCommunist Party (CCP), stating that there were “tremendous\nsimilarities between the two parties”, which shows his clear\nchange in stance on China.\n\n##### Malware and Infrastructure\n\nInsikt Group identified 2 Winnti C2s (185.161.209[.]87\nand 86.107.197[.]182) and a probable Cobalt Strike C2\n(178.157.91[.]144) operated by TAG-28.\n\nWinnti malware has historically been used by several Chinese\nstate-sponsored groups, including APT41/Barium and APT17,\nand is [commonly](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer) [associated with activity linked to multiple](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2019/07/24/apt17-is-run-by-the-jinan-bureau-of-the-chinese-ministry-of-state-security/)\ngroups of loosely connected private contractors operating on\nbehalf of China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS). In September\n2020, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged 5 Chinese\nnationals linked to APT41 that had access to Winnti malware for\n\n\nconducting widespread intrusion operations targeting over 100\nvictims globally. Clustering all activity featuring the use of the\nWinnti malware to a single “Winnti” activity group is insufficient\ngiven the shared capability across different groups and the\nvarying targeting remits and modus operandi of Winnti users.\n\n\n_Table 1: Malicious infrastructure used by TAG-28 in this campaign_\n\n|C2 IP|First Identified|Ports|Hosting Provider|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Winnti 185.161.209[.]87|March 11, 2021|80, 443, 8080, 8443|Zemlyaniy Dmitro Leonidovich (DeltaHost)||\n|Winnti 86.107.197[.]182|April 8, 2021|443, 8443|MVPS LTD||\n|Suspected Cobalt Strike 178.157.91[.]144|June 10, 2021|443, 53|MVPS LTD||\n|Table 1: Malicious infrastruct|ure used by TAG-28 in this ca|mpaign|||\n\n\nPivoting on the C2 IPs, we identified several linked domains.\nAll of the domains were registered on December 30, 2020\nusing the registrar Gandi SAS, shared the same apex domain\n“samuelblog”, and used “KE” (denoting Kenya) for the registrant\ncountry.\n\n  - samuelblog[.]me\n\n  - samuelblog[.]site\n\n  - samuelblog[.]info\n\n  - samuelblog[.]website\n\n  - samuelblog[.]xyz\n\nA further 4 subdomains were also identified resolving to the\nsame C2 infrastructure listed in Table 1.

Where the hex data\nwas longer than 24 characters, the data was split into runs of 56\ncharacters separated by a period. Further research highlighted\nseveral other domains displaying a similar pattern (api.[hex\ndata].ns1.); the majority of IPs resolved by these domains had\ntriggered Cobalt Strike C2 server detections in the Recorded\n[Future Platform. Further to this point, a tutorial video created by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAB5G-QOyx8)\nRaphael Mudge, the creator of Cobalt Strike, shows DNS beacon\ntraffic matching the pattern observed above. Given these factors,\nwe determined the suspicious DNS traffic for samuelblog[.]info\nwas likely a result of its use as a Cobalt Strike C2.\n\n##### Adversary\n\nBased on our visibility, Insikt Group strongly believes TAG-28\nis a Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group tasked with\ngathering intelligence on Indian targets. Our attribution to China\nis predicated on their use of Winnti malware, which is exclusively\nshared among several Chinese state-sponsored activity groups,\nand their targeting of at least 3 distinct Indian organizations in this\ncampaign. As we continue to track TAG-28’s operational activity,\nwe will gather additional referential data points that will allow us\nto build on our current understanding of their capabilities and\nobjectives and highlight overlaps with existing activity groups or\ngraduate TAG-28 to a full-fledged “Red” group like RedEcho or\nRedFoxtrot. Additional data points, such as persona handles and\nfurther upstream attacker infrastructure, would support actor\nattribution efforts.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Outlook\n\nThis research highlights China’s continued strategic and\ntactical interest in India-based organizations, both in the\nprivate and public sectors. The 2020 border skirmishes and the\nsubsequent economic sanctions levied by the Indian government\nbanning Chinese mobile applications from the Indian market have\nresulted in increased tensions between the 2 nations. Gaining\naccess and insight into Indian government departments and\norganizations will therefore likely remain of paramount interest\nto Chinese state-sponsored actors for the foreseeable future,\nas cyber operations play a key role in gathering intelligence on\nmilitary technology or national security matters, in addition to\npolitical and foreign relation developments.\n\nWhile we cannot confirm the intent behind the observed\nintrusions, an Indian media entity with broad reach across the\nIndian population and the Aadhar system both present valuable\n[targets for surveillance, espionage, or information operations.](https://www.news18.com/news/india/india-is-the-next-target-of-chinese-misinformation-machinery-and-we-are-already-falling-prey-to-it-2680317.html)\n\nAlthough several China-based groups have migrated over to\nusing Shadowpad and other relatively new malware families, this\ncampaign highlights that established tooling such as Winnti and\noffensive security tools (OST) like Cobalt Strike still prove highly\neffective for China-nexus threat groups to conduct targeted\nintrusions.\n\n\n#### Mitigations\n\nConduct the following measures to detect and mitigate\nactivity associated with TAG-28 activity.\n\n  - Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS),\n\nintrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any network\ndefense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon\nreview, consider blocking connection attempts to and\nfrom — external IP addresses and domains associated\nwith TAG-28. Clients can view a list of these in the\nappendix of the clients-only version of this report.\n\n  - Clients can use Recorded Future Hunting Packages to\n\nhunt and detect malware families used by TAG-28.\n\n  - We proactively detect and log malicious server\n\nconfigurations in our Command and Control Security\nControl Feed. The C2 list includes malware and\ntools used by TAG-28 and Chinese state-sponsored\nthreat activity groups, such as Winnti, PlugX, and\nAXIOMATICASYMPTOTE. Recorded Future clients should\nalert on and block these C2 servers to allow for detection\nand remediation of active intrusions.\n\n  - Recorded Future Threat Intelligence, Third-Party\n\n[Intelligence, and SecOps Intelligence module users can](https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/)\nmonitor real-time output from NTA and Malware Analysis\nanalytics to identify suspected targeted intrusion activity\ninvolving your organization or key vendors and partners.\n\n  - Ensure operating systems and software are up to\n\ndate with the latest patches to protect against known\nvulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Recorded Future Threat Activity Group and Malware Taxonomy\n\nRecorded Future’s research group, Insikt, tracks threat\nactors and their activity, focusing on state actors from China,\nIran, Russia, and North Korea, as well as cybercriminals —\nindividuals and groups — from Russia, CIS states, China,\nIran, and Brazil. We emphasize tracking activity groups and\nwhere possible, attributing them to nation state government,\norganizations, or affiliate institutions.\n\nOur coverage includes:\n\n\n**ADVERSARY**\n\n\n\n   - Government organizations and intelligence\nagencies, their associated laboratories, partners,\nindustry collaborators, proxy entities, and\nindividual threat actors\n\n   - Recorded Future-identified, suspected nationstate activity groups, such as RedAlpha,\nRedBravo, Red Delta, and BlueAlpha and many\nother industry established groups\n\n   - Cybercriminal individuals and groups established\nand named by Recorded Future\n\n   - Newly emerging malware, as well as prolific,\npersistent commodity malware\n\nInsikt Group publicly names a new threat activity group\nor campaign, such as RedFoxtrot, when analysts typically\nhave data corresponding to at least three points on the\nDiamond Model of Intrusion Analysis with at least medium\nconfidence. We will occasionally report on significant activity\nusing a temporary activity clustering name such as TAG-21\nwhere the activity is new and significant but doesn't map\nto existing groupings and hasn't yet graduated or merged\ninto an established activity group. We tie this to a threat\nactor only when we can point to a handle, persona, person,\nor organization responsible. We will write about the activity\nas a campaign in the absence of this level of adversary\ndata. We use the most widely used or recognized name for a\nparticular group when the public body of empirical evidence\nis clear the activity corresponds to a known group.\n\nInsikt Group uses a simple color and phonetic alphabet\nnaming convention for new nation-state threat actor groups\nor campaigns. The color generally corresponds to that\nnation’s flag colors, with more color/nation pairings to be\nadded as we identify and attribute new threat actor groups\nassociated with new nations.\n\nFor newly identified cybercriminal groups, Insikt\nGroup uses a naming convention corresponding to the\nGreek alphabet. Where we have identified a criminal entity\nconnected to a particular country, we will use the appropriate\ncountry color, and where that group may be tied to a specific\ngovernment organization, tie it to that entity specifically.\n\nInsikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming\nnewly identified malware.\n\n\n**INFRASTRUCTURE** **CAPABILITY**\n\n**VICTIM**\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Recorded Future\n\nRecorded Future is the world’s largest provider of intelligence for enterprise\n\nsecurity.
