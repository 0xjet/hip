    "plain_text": "# Russian National Sentenced to Prison for Operating Websites Devoted to Fraud and Malicious Cyber Activities\n\n**[justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-sentenced-prison-operating-websites-devoted-fraud-and-malicious-cyber](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-sentenced-prison-operating-websites-devoted-fraud-and-malicious-cyber)**\n\nJune 26, 2020\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\nOffice of Public Affairs\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nFriday, June 26, 2020\n\nA Russian national was sentenced today to nine years in prison for his operation of two\nwebsites devoted to the facilitation of payment card fraud, computer hacking, and other\ncrimes before Senior U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal\nDivision, U.S. Attorney G. Zachary Terwilliger for the Eastern District of Virginia, and Special\nAgent in Charge Matthew S. Miller of the U.S. Secret Service’s Washington Field Office\nmade the announcement.\n\nAccording to court documents, Aleksei Burkov, 30, ran a website called “Cardplanet” that\nsold payment card numbers (e.g., debit and credit card numbers) that had been stolen\nprimarily through computer intrusions, victimizing hundreds of thousands. Many of the card\nnumbers offered for sale belonged to U.S. citizens. The stolen credit card data sold on\nBurkov’s site has resulted in over $20 million in fraudulent purchases made using U.S. credit\ncard accounts.\n\n\n-----\n\nBurkov also ran another website that served as an invite-only club where elite cybercriminals\ncould advertise stolen goods, such as personal identifying information and malicious\nsoftware, and criminal services, such as money laundering and hacking services. To obtain\nmembership in Burkov’s cybercrime forum, prospective members needed three existing\nmembers to “vouch” for their good reputation among cybercriminals and to provide a sum of\nmoney, normally $5,000, as insurance. These measures were designed to keep law\nenforcement from accessing Burkov’s cybercrime forum and to ensure that members of the\nforum honored any deals made while conducting business on the forum.\n\nBurkov was arrested at Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel in December 2015. An\nIsraeli district court approved his extradition in 2017. He was extradited to the United States\nfrom Israel on Nov. 11, 2019, after appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court and the Israeli High\nCourt of Justice were denied. On Jan. 23, 2020, he pleaded guilty to one count of access\ndevice fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud, identity theft,\ncomputer intrusions, wire fraud, and money laundering.\n\nSenior Trial Attorney Laura Fong of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual\nProperty Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kellen S. Dwyer and Alexander P. Berrang of\nthe Eastern District of Virginia prosecuted the case. The Criminal Division’s Office of\nInternational Affairs provided significant assistance in securing the defendant’s extradition\nfrom Israel.\n\nThe year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice.
