Diep Saeeda, a well-known\nPakistani HRD, has been targeted by digital attacks; the first suspicious messages received\nafter she began campaigning for the release of “disappeared” activist Raza Khan. Diep and\nother activists were targeted with extremely personalised messages that included malicious\nlinks or attachments that, when opened, would either attempt to infect their devices with\nmalware, or direct them to fake Google or Facebook login pages designed to steal their\npasswords.\n\n## View Report in English\n\n[Download PDF](https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ASA3383662018ENGLISH.pdf)\n\n\n-----",
