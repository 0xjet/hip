To fulfill the demands of offensive cyberattacks, an industry has emerged\n\nthat can sell tools, services and training to governments, corporations, organized crime and\n\neven wealthy individuals. Cybermercenaries are part of this industry, and in return for their\n\nservices, they get monetary rewards or other benefits.\n\nThe problems that these cybermercenaries cause are getting more profound and are gaining\n\nmore attention in recent years. While the services of cybermercenaries may theoretically be\n\nof use in the fight against terrorism and organized crime in well-established jurisdictions\n\nthat have democratic control mechanisms and export controls in place, in practice, we see\n\nthat the services of these cybermercenaries are being used to attack political opposition,\n\ndissidents, journalists, and human rights activists. [1, 2]\n\nOffensive tools are used to spy on these targets — and this can have devastating\n\nconsequences. For example, some politicians and journalists who saw no other option\n\nthan to flee their home country became the target of aggressive cyberattacks around the\n\nsame time they decided to go into exile.[3] These attacks might have been the final straw that\n\nforced them to flee the country.\n\nThe problem with selling cybermercenary services goes deep, even when they are intended\n\nfor use in narrow, ultra-targeted campaigns. Offensive tools and methodologies may become\n\nwidely available when advanced malware and knowledge of vulnerabilities are stolen in\n\nhacks and then leaked. For example, in 2015, a well-known hacker-for-hire organization in\n\nItaly became the victim of a hack and its tools were made available to anybody who wanted\n\nto learn how to use them.[4]\n\nTo mitigate the risks to society that these cybermercenaries’ actions cause, there have been\n\ncalls to regulate the cybermercenary industry with international agreements and laws.[5, 6]\n\nThese proposals, however, are difficult to implement because countries with different points\n\nof view would have to come to an agreement about what such regulations would look like\n\nand how it gets enforced. Even when worldwide regulations are in place, there will still be\n\nlarge gray areas where all kinds of actors can offer their services. Moreover, nations might\n\nview cybermercenaries that have headquarters in their own country as a national asset. Not\n\nonly can these cybermercenaries be used for attacks that are aligned with the interests of\n\ntheir home country, but they can also be used as a political tool for foreign policy, just like\n\nconventional weapons.\n\nThis research looks into a threat actor group that can be considered a cybermercenary, but\n\none that prefers to stay in the shadows. To our knowledge, this hacker-for-hire group does\n\nnot operate out of a physical building, nor does it have a shiny prospectus that describes its\n\nservices. The group does not try to wriggle out of a difficult position by justifying its business,\n\nnor is it involved in lawsuits against anybody attempting to report on their activities. Instead,\n\n\n-----\n\nthis group is quite open about what it does: breaking into email accounts and social media\n\naccounts for money. This threat actor is also involved in selling highly sensitive personal\n\ndata like cell tower phone logs, passenger flight records, banking data, and passport details.\n\nThe group advertises its services in Russian-speaking underground forums such as Probiv,\n\nwhere cybercriminals gather to do business with each other. At first glance, it seems that\n\nthis hacker-for-hire mostly has customers whose main motive is financial gain. However, we\n\ncan also attribute significant political attacks against human rights activists and politicians\n\nin about a dozen countries to this group.\n\nThe Russian-speaking threat actor calls itself Rockethack. While we do not know this\n\ngroup’s whereabouts, we have a good knowledge of its working hours. We suspect that\n\nRockethack possesses detailed knowledge of how telecommunications and ISPs work in\n\nRussia and neighboring countries.\n\nRockethack has a massive associated intrusion set with thousands of indicators, which we\n\nare tracking under the name Void Balaur. We chose this name because Balaur is a monstrous\n\nmultiheaded legendary creature in Eastern European folklore. It is fittingly symbolic for the\n\nmultiple purposes for which Void Balaur is being hired: spying on a local shop in Moscow, on\n\njournalists, human right activists, politicians, scientists, doctors working in a few dozen IVF\n\nclinics, genomics and biotechnology companies, Telco engineers with deep knowledge of\n\nmobile operators’ networks, and business aviation companies. Void Balaur also dabbles in\n\ncorporate espionage, is suspected to be selling data to cybercriminals in order to fight their\n\nfellow cybercriminals over disputes, and has conducted attacks against cryptocurrency\n\nusers.\n\nWe have uncovered more than 3,500 of the group’s targets, some of whom have suffered\n\nlong-lasting and repeated attacks. Our research revealed a clear picture: Void Balaur goes\n\nafter the most private and personal data of businesses and individuals then sells that data\n\nto whomever wants to pay for it. This business model is perhaps best illustrated by the\n\nmottos the group has been using on the now defunct website, rockethack[.]me. The actor\n\ngroup used a couple of remarkable mottos in this website. One was:\n\n**Деньги не главное в свободном интернете. Главное – власть, которая принадлежит**\n\n**тому, кто контролирует потоки информации.**\n\nThis translates to:\n\nMoney is not the main thing on the free internet. The main thing is the power that\n\nbelongs to the one who controls the flow of information.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe motto is taken from the book “Code of Durov. The Real Story of the Social Network\n\n_“VKontakte” and its Creator (2012),” written by the Russian journalist Nikolay Kononov. This_\n\nbook is about Pavel Durov, the founder of the Russian social networking site Vk.com and\n\nthe messenger platform Telegram.\n\nLater, the group used a different motto:\n\n**Вся информация мира — это сплетни. Если умеешь их слушать, то можно**\n\n**научиться и вычленять истину.**\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n**_All information in the world is gossip. If you know how to listen to them, then you can_**\n\n**_learn and isolate the truth._**\n\nThis motto comes from another book, “False Mirrors,” by Sergey Lukyanenko. Lukyanenko\n\nis a Russian science fiction author who has voiced political views on Ukraine and Russian\n\ncountermeasures against the Magnitsky Act.\n\nBoth mottos reflect the nature of Void Balaur’s business: the cybermercenary not only will\n\nsteal highly sensitive information from individuals and businesses on demand, but it also\n\nseems to be hungry for data itself. Before a customer asks for a new service, Void Balaur\n\nmay already be thinking about how it can get more personal and private data. Throughout\n\nvarious industries, we saw that Void Balaur targets key employees of corporations who\n\nprobably have access to large amounts of personal data.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Starting Point of Our Investigation\n\nWhile many countries around the world were in lockdown during March 2020 to combat the rapidly\n\nincreasing Covid-19 infection numbers, we were contacted by a long-time target of Pawn Storm, an\n\nAdvanced Persistent Threat (APT) group also known as APT28.[7] This person told us that his wife, who\n\nworks as a scientist, had received a dozen phishing emails on her Gmail account.\n\nFigure 1. Gmail phishing emails that the spouse of a long-time Pawn Storm target received in 2020\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Credential phishing email stating that the recipient must pay off a debt and\nmust appear in court\n\nWe were immediately alarmed: this would not be the first time Pawn Storm targeted the spouses of their\n\nactual targets.[8] However, a closer look at the phishing emails did not show any of the usual indicators\n\nand modus operandi that we have attributed to Pawn Storm during the intensive research we have been\n\nconducting on the group since 2014. The phishing emails, which the spouse received in March 2020, did\n\nnot point to Pawn Storm, but they did lead us to another attribution set that we later named Void Balaur.\n\nIn this attribution set, we found the domain name rockethack[.]me, which belonged to a hacking service\n\nthat advertises in underground forums such as Probiv under the name “Rockethack.” Throughout the rest\n\nof this report, we will refer to this hacking service as Void Balaur.\n\nVoid Balaur offers services for hacking into the email mailboxes of several email providers and social\n\nmedia accounts for money (and possibly other benefits). For some email providers like rambler.ru and\n\nmail.ru, the group offers services at a premium rate where complete copies of mailboxes are stolen\n\nwithout any user interaction. We have no reason to believe that the latter is not a real business offering.\n\nThis means that in some cases, Void Balaur can access mailboxes without the user noticing it. How they\n\ndo this will be discussed in a later section.\n\n**Domain** **Registrant** **Description**\n\n27g4dwjallqnzu0[.]space Privacy protected Spam URL\n\naccount-googl[.]com poxxpoz@pm.me Sender domain\n\nbflqj2xmpbwqkzpwg[.]fun Privacy protected Spam URL\n\nizwg17taoz9noedve[.]xyz Privacy protected Spam URL\n\nmyaccount.mail.sessionverify.com[.]ru Privacy protected Phishing site\n\noapjiyfybhj0jszll[.]fun Privacy protected Spam URL\n\nwnppid4qunpuwuvqk[.]fun Privacy protected Spam URL\n\nyen9y2flnrcbwsvy9[.]fun Privacy protected Spam URL\n\nTable 1.

We see hostnames that look like\n\ngeneric phishing hostnames, a domain name that resembles a well-known cryptocurrency exchange, two\n\ndomains that are related to business aviation companies in Russia. and a domain that was mentioned in\n\na report by eQualitie on notable attacks against human right activists in Uzbekistan.[11]\n\nThe next sections will show that these apparent low-confidence relations are not a coincidence, but\n\npart of Void Balaur’s long-term campaigns. We will show that Void Balaur is not only into hacking email\n\nmailboxes but is also in the business of selling the sensitive private information of its targets. This includes\n\ncell tower log data, passport details, SMS messages, and more. In addition, Void Balaur appears to target\n\nmany organizations and individuals that are likely to have access to highly sensitive data on people.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Void Balaur in the Underground\n\nThe earliest reference to Void Balaur we could find in underground forums dates back to September 8,\n\n2017. On that day, complaints about spam advertising Void Balaur’s services (under the name Rockethack)\n\nwere posted on the underground forum exploit.in. The actual contents of the spam message from 2017\n\nstated that Void Balaur had already been selling its services via resellers in the past, so it is likely that Void\n\nBalaur was in the hacker-for-hire business before 2017. This corresponds with digital traces we were able\n\nto find that pointed to the group’s activities in September 2015 (see Appendix C).\n\nIt took another six months before Void Balaur started placing paid advertisements in underground forums\n\nlike Darkmoney and Probiv. Probiv, which was established in 2014, acts as an underground marketplace\n\nwhere malicious actors gather to offer specialized services mostly aimed at providing access to data,\n\nmaking it an ideal place for Void Balaur to advertise. Darkmoney, meanwhile, is an underground forum\n\nfor carders. Void Balaur also advertised their services on Tenec, an underground forum specializing in\n\nmonetizing stolen credentials, and Dublikat — yet another underground forum.\n\nThe feedback that Void Balaur receives on underground forums is unanimously positive. Posters mention\n\nthat the hacking service delivers the requested information on time, while others commented positively\n\non the quality of the delivered information from mailboxes. Yet others posted about passport details they\n\nhad requested.\n\nTo our knowledge, Void Balaur has never advertised in underground forums that were not Russian\n\nlanguage-oriented. However, there used to be a website on rockethack[.]me that was registered on\n\nFebruary 21, 2018 and was available on its bare IP address 139.60.163[.]53 until at least December\n\n2020. On the website, Void Balaur listed services such as hacking into mailboxes or flooding them with\n\nspam, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and flooding phone numbers (in Commonwealth of\n\nIndependent States or CIS countries only).\n\n\n-----\n\n|Email provider|Amount in March 2021 (Russian Rubles)|Amount in September 2017 (Russian Rubles)|\n|---|---|---|\n|Gmail|> 40,000 (US$550)|> 25,000 (US344$)|\n|Protonmail|> 50,000 (US$688)|-|\n|Mail.ru|10,000 (US$138)|4,000 (US$55)|\n|Rambler.ru|12,000 (US$165)|4,000 (US$55)|\n|Rambler.ru (no hack)|-|60,000 (US$826)|\n|Yandex.ru|12,000 (US$165)|,5000 (US$69)|\n|Yandex.ru (no hack)|> 20,000 (US$275)|> 30,000 (US$413)|\n|Vk.com|10,000 (US$138)|8,000 (US$110)|\n|Vk.com (hijacking without password change)|> 20,000 (US$275)|> 80,000 (US$1,101)|\n|Telegram|150,000 (US$2,064)|-|\n|Corporate email|> 30,000 (US$413)|>10,000 (US$138)|\n\n\nTable 4. Starting prices of Void Balaur’s services in Russian Rubles as advertised on Probiv. We added\nequivalent US Dollar amounts based on the exchange rate on September 14, 2021\n\nFigure 3. The website of Void Balaur (under the name Rockethack) in 2020 when it was still available\non its bare IP address. At the time we took a screenshot, the website had a motto in Russian that is\nattributed to Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO and founder of Facebook. We have not been able to verify the\nauthenticity of this quote.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Offerings from the website of Void Balaur in 2020\n\nThe main activities of Void Balaur that were initially advertised on underground forums were breaking into\n\nfree webmail, social media, and corporate email accounts. Copies of mailboxes were being offered both\n\nwith and without user interaction. Most likely, the option to deliver data with user interaction happens\n\nvia credential phishing, and when needed, includes two-factor authentication. For some Russian email\n\nproviders, copies of mailboxes are offered without any user interaction. We have no reason to doubt\n\nthat this is a real business offering, because we have not seen negative feedback on Void Balaur in\n\nunderground forums. We don’t know how customer data like emails are stolen without user interaction,\n\nbut there are some scenarios where this would be possible. Note that these are only our conjectures\n\non how the information is stolen; Void Balaur could have used other methods to gather data from their\n\ntargets without user interaction.\n\n- Key employees of email providers are knowingly selling data — either directly or indirectly — to the\n\nactors behind Void Balaur.\n\n- Key employees who have legal access to mailboxes have been compromised.\n\n- Law enforcement personnel who may have legal access to mailboxes are compromised.\n\n- The computer systems of the email provider have security issues or have been breached.\n\n- The group uses databases with leaked credentials to access mailboxes without user interaction.\n\n\n-----\n\nNaturally, the service that retrieves emails without user interaction is offered at a premium rate. We were\n\nunable to establish how they can offer this kind of data.\n\nStarting in 2019, Void Balaur advertised the sale of very private and sensitive data of individuals from\n\nRussia in underground forums. For example:\n\n|Type of Information|Starting Prices (Rubles)|\n|---|---|\n|Information on Russian passports, foreign passports, marriage certificates, and N1 forms|> 1,500 (US$21)|\n|Information on purchased tickets where a passport is needed (train, bus, airlines, and ferries).

Some of the offerings on sensitive personal data that Void Balaur is advertising in underground\nforums. Starting prices are in Russian rubles. We added equivalent US Dollar amounts based on the\nexchange rate on September 14, 2021\n\nThe telecom data that Void Balaur is peddling includes phone call records with cell tower locations that\n\ncould reveal who a person has been calling, the duration of the calls, and the approximate location where\n\nthe calls were made. Knowledge of these details could serve several purposes, including committing\n\nserious crimes. Furthermore, blocking phone numbers, a service that Void Balaur also offers, can help\n\nfacilitate serious crimes — for example, by ensuring that someone is unreachable by phone while the\n\ncrime is taking place.\n\nThe price for getting phone call records with or without cell tower information varies a lot between different\n\nRussian providers, up to about a factor of ten. Apparently, getting phone records from some telecom\n\ncompanies are much easier than from others.\n\nWe are not sure how they obtain such sensitive private data — it’s possible that they get it by paying bribes\n\nto insiders in the telecom companies. This scenario was supported by a media article that was published\n\nin 2019 by BBC Russia.[12] Other possible scenarios are that key engineers of telecom operators are being\n\nhacked or that the network of telecom companies is being compromised. During our research, we found\n\nsupporting evidence for the former: Void Balaur has been targeting key engineers and management of\n\nvarious mobile telco companies, as shown in Table 6.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Target|Country|Date|\n|---|---|---|\n|Deputy director of core telco network|Russia|Aug 2021|\n|Senior manager of telecom company|Russia|May 2021|\n|Senior telco network engineer|Russia|Mar 2021|\n|Senior telco network engineer|US/Russia|Nov 2020|\n|Senior telco network engineer|US/Russia/Israel|before Jun 2020|\n|Founder of a mobile virtual network operator|UK/Russia|May 2021|\n|Mobile satellite communications operator|Russia|May 2021|\n|Manufacturer of cellular equipment 1|Russia|Dec 2020|\n|Manufacturer of cellular equipment 2|Russia|Oct 2021|\n|Radio navigation company 1|Russia|Jul 2020 – May 2021|\n|Radio navigation company 2|Russia|Apr 2021|\n|Radio navigation company 3|Russia|May 2021|\n|Radio navigation company 4|Russia|May 2021|\n\n\nTable 6. Noteworthy Void Balaur targets in the telecom industry. For one target, we only have an\napproximate target date\n\nIn December 2020, reports were released on the investigative journalism website Bellingcat alleging that\n\nthere are direct relations between persons working for an intelligence agency and attempted assassinations.\n\nAs part of their investigation, Bellingcat journalists bought private flight data from a service that advertises\n\non Probiv.[13] We do not know the exact data sources that these investigative journalists used, but we\n\ndo know that Void Balaur offers telecom and passenger flight record data, which was possibly one of\n\nthe sources used by the journalists (and we also know that Void Balaur advertises on Probiv, which we\n\nmentioned earlier).\n\nNaturally, the allegations generated a lot of attention in international media. In addition, the news reports\n\nwere discussed in underground forums as well. In a posting on an underground forum, Void Balaur\n\nexpressed concern about the allegations, as they could be a threat to its business.\n\nOne message posted by Void Balaur roughly translates to “Do you think they [Russian LE] will try to discover\n\nthe whole chain, or just calm down the noise [generated by the media reports]?” This shows that Void\n\nBalaur was concerned about potential backlash. However, we did not notice any visible consequences.\n\nTo our knowledge, Void Balaur did not slow down its services during the time international media showed\n\na higher interest in underground forums like Probiv.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. A Void Balaur post in the underground forum Probiv published on December 18, 2020. The\nposter expressed concerns about an investigative journalists claims of being able to buy airline\npassenger and cell tower data on Probiv.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Void Balaur’s Targets\n\nDuring our research we were able to collect a significant amount of information on Void Balaur’s campaigns.\n\nWe found more than 3,500 email addresses for individuals and companies that the group targeted.\n\nWe do not have a list of the users of Void Balaur’s services, but we do know about customers who\n\ncommented positively on the group’s services in semi-public underground posts. These customers\n\nwere satisfied with the services that Void Balaur provided, such as breaking into email boxes, providing\n\ninformation on passports, breaking into Telegram accounts, and offering sensitive telco information.\n\nThese customers were active participants in underground forums like tenec.cc, Probiv and Darkmoney.\n\nWe suspect, however, that the more important customers of Void Balaur are not active participants of\n\nforums like Probiv. We started to realize this when we read a report published in 2019 by the Canadian\n\nnonprofit organization eQualitie.[14]\n\nThe report describes various phishing and web attacks that have been launched against human rights\n\nactivists and journalists in Uzbekistan since 2016. It also shows attacks against the websites of media\n\noutlets between 2016 and 2017. The phishing campaigns were done over nearly a year, from March 2018\n\nto February 2019. The report mentions that a threat actor was using professional vulnerability scanning\n\ntools such as Acunetix, NetSparker, and WPScan against three websites that cover political news in\n\nUzbekistan. EQualitie also reported that it suspects that the same threat actor sent 14 phishing emails to\n\ntargets who are either journalists or human right activists in Uzbekistan. In 2020, Amnesty International\n\npublished a follow-up report that linked the campaigns that eQualitie originally reported to both Windows\n\nand Android malware.[15] Moreover, Amnesty International was able to find an additional 170 targeted\n\naccounts in Uzbekistan and neighboring countries.\n\nAmnesty International and eQualitie clearly indicate that the attacks in Uzbekistan had a serious impact\n\non the lives of some individuals. This is a telling example of a cybermercenary providing services for a\n\npossibly larger campaign that is causing significant harm to human lives.\n\nWhile both reports do not attribute the attacks to a particular threat actor, we attribute the attacks with a\n\nmedium confidence level to Void Balaur based on the following:\n\n - An overlap in infrastructure between Void Balaur and the indicators that were posted by eQualitie and\n\nAmnesty International.\n\n\n-----\n\n- The hostnames that were used in known Void Balaur cases we are tracking and the attacks described\n\nby eQualitie have a form that is virtually unique in an enormous database of multibillion records of\n\npassive DNS data spanning 10 years.\n\n- Some of the Uzbek targets we found to have been targeted by Void Balaur in 2020 are the same as\n\nthe targets described in the eQualitie and Amnesty reports.\n\n- The editor in chief of a media website that was attacked in 2016 and 2017 according to the eQualitie\n\nreport was targeted by Void Balaur in 2020 through his private email address.\n\n- We found one of the email addresses that was mentioned in the eQualitie report as a sender of\n\ncredential phishing emails was back on the group’s target list.\n\nAppendix B provides a more detailed explanation on why we think Void Balaur was behind the campaigns\n\nas described in the eQualitie report and the Amnesty International report.\n\nWe do not know who paid Void Balaur to target Uzbek-related media and civil rights activists. Apparently,\n\nthe client was able to buy Void Balaur’s services even before the group started actively advertising in\n\nunderground forums. The campaigns against Uzbek targets started as early as 2016 and were still ongoing\n\nas of 2020, according to our data (and probably even extended to 2021). This shows that Void Balaur is\n\nbeing hired for long-term campaigns, something we have seen for other targets as well.\n\n**Target** **First attack** **Last attack**\n\nUzbek journalist platform Nov 3, 2020 Nov 11, 2020\n\nSender email address mentioned in the Deflect report Nov 5, 2020 Dec 23, 2020\n\nIndividual who signed a political petition in Uzbekistan Nov 5, 2020 Nov 9, 2020\n\nEditor-in-chief of a media organization focused on Uzbekistan Nov 5, 2020 Nov 7, 2020\n\nUzbek human rights activist Nov 7, 2020 Nov 9, 2020\n\nUzbek political party Nov 5, 2020 Nov 5, 2020\n\nTable 7. Uzbek media and human rights activists that Void Balaur targeted in 2020. The indicated\ntimeframes are conservative; these attacks likely occurred over longer periods.\n\nWhile Void Balaur advertises in underground forums where criminals gather to do business, its services\n\nare not only used for typical cybercrime but for political reasons as well. This shows that Void Balaur is\n\nknowingly or unknowingly facilitating attacks in which human rights may be violated, a pattern we have\n\nalso seen in a couple of other campaigns. A significant part of these campaigns look like the work of an\n\nAPT attacker with long-term goals.\n\nSome of Void Balaur’s campaigns are quite brazen. For example, we found that in September 2021,\n\nthe group targeted the private email addresses of a former head of an intelligence agency, five active\n\ngovernment ministers (including the minister of defense) and two members of the national parliament of\n\nan Eastern European country.\n\n|Target|First attack|Last attack|\n|---|---|---|\n|Uzbek journalist platform|Nov 3, 2020|Nov 11, 2020|\n|Sender email address mentioned in the Deflect report|Nov 5, 2020|Dec 23, 2020|\n|Individual who signed a political petition in Uzbekistan|Nov 5, 2020|Nov 9, 2020|\n|Editor-in-chief of a media organization focused on Uzbekistan|Nov 5, 2020|Nov 7, 2020|\n|Uzbek human rights activist|Nov 7, 2020|Nov 9, 2020|\n|Uzbek political party|Nov 5, 2020|Nov 5, 2020|\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also found presidential candidates for the 2020 Belarus elections on Void Balaur’s target list.\n\n**Target** **Country** **Sector** **Date**\n\nPresidential candidate Belarus Politics Sep 2020\n\nPresidential candidate Belarus Politics Sep 2020\n\nMember of the opposition party Belarus Politics Sep 2020\n\nTable 8. Void Balaur targeted high-profile Belarusian political personalities in 2020\n\nAside from political targets in Uzbekistan and Belarus, Void Balaur also targeted politicians and government\n\nofficials in the Ukraine, Slovakia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Norway, France, and Italy. Some of these\n\nattacks were part of a larger campaign and not necessarily restricted to attacks over the internet alone.\n\nSome of the victims felt so threatened that they left their home countries and went into exile.\n\n**Target** **Country** **Sector** **Date**\n\nPolitician Armenia Parliament Dec 2020\n\nPolitician Ukraine Parliament Oct 2020\n\nSpouse of politician Ukraine Nov 2020\n\nDiplomat Russia Government Oct 2020\n\nMinister Russia Government Sep 2021\n\nPolitician Kazakhstan Government Jan 2021\n\nTable 9.

Void Balaur very likely targeted four politicians in France, Italy, and Norway for the first time on\nthe same day in August 2021. Another French former politician was targeted in September 2021. The\ntargets are from different countries, but they shared similar political views.\n\n|Target|Country|Sector|Date|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Presidential candidate|Belarus|Politics|Sep 2020|\n|Presidential candidate|Belarus|Politics|Sep 2020|\n|Member of the opposition party|Belarus|Politics|Sep 2020|\n\n|Target|Country|Sector|Date|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Politician|Armenia|Parliament|Dec 2020|\n|Politician|Ukraine|Parliament|Oct 2020|\n|Spouse of politician|Ukraine||Nov 2020|\n|Diplomat|Russia|Government|Oct 2020|\n|Minister|Russia|Government|Sep 2021|\n|Politician|Kazakhstan|Government|Jan 2021|\n\n|Target|Country|Sector|Date|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Politician|France|Parliament|Aug 2021|\n|Politician|France|EU parliament|Aug 2021|\n|Former politician|France|Activist|Sep 2021|\n|Politician|Italy|EU parliament|Aug 2021|\n|Politician|Norway|Political activist|Aug 2021|\n\n\n-----\n\nJournalists and media organizations are also frequent targets of Void Balaur. We have seen the group\n\ntarget more than 25 journalists, although we expect the actual number of targeted journalists to be higher.\n\nSome phishing attacks by Void Balaur that, at first glance, look to have a financial motive may actually\n\nbe associated with large-scale disruptive attacks. For example, the group launched attacks against a\n\ncryptocurrency exchange for years, targeting not only their customers, but executives as well through\n\ntheir corporate and personal email addresses. The website of the company has been a regular victim\n\nof DDoS and hacking attacks and one of their employees was even kidnapped for ransom in the past.[16]\n\nWhile we do not know whether Void Balaur had anything to do with the kidnapping and the DDoS attacks,\n\nthis is again an example where a Void Balaur victim also suffered from larger-scale attacks with real-life\n\nconsequences.\n\nSeveral of the group’s targets are from Russia and other neighboring countries, But the group is also\n\nactive in other countries, including the US, Israel, Japan and European countries.\n\nFigure 6. Countries in which Void Balaur email targets were located (companies were targeted via\ncorporate email addresses; individuals were targeted via private email addresses)\n\nSome of the threat actor’s campaigns span a long period of time. The timeline in Figure 8 illustrates a\n\nlong, ongoing campaign against the companies of one of the most successful conglomerates in Russia.\n\nFrom at least September 2020 to August 2021, Void Balaur has been targeting board members, directors,\n\nexecutives and family members — all associated with the same commercial conglomerate.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. The timeline of a campaign launched against one of the largest conglomerates in Russia.\nSeveral board members, executives, directors and even family members of the billionaire owner were\ntargeted over a year. This shows that for corporate espionage-related attacks, the campaigns of Void\nBalaur can be persistent and long lasting.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Targets with Access to a Large Amount of Private Information\n\nWhile investigating the campaigns of Void Balaur, we noticed that the threat actor was targeting\n\norganizations and individuals who potentially have access to a large amount of individuals’ sensitive data.\n\nSome of these targets align with Void Balaur’s offerings in underground forums, while others are new.\n\nWe have observed Void Balaur targeting organizations and individuals in the following sectors:\n\n - Mobile and core telco companies\n\n - Cellular equipment vendors\n\n - Radio and satellite communication companies\n\n - ATM machine vendors\n\n - Point-of-sale (POS) system vendors\n\n - Fintech companies and banks\n\n - Business aviation companies\n\n - Medical insurance organizations in at least three regions of Russia\n\n - In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) clinics in Russia\n\n - Biotechnology companies that offer genetic testing services\n\nThe campaigns are often conducted over an extended period. We do not know exactly why these\n\norganizations and individuals are being targeted. The size and lucrativeness of the industry may play a\n\nrole — take for example the IVF market, which has grown into a multibillion industry and could be a reason\n\nfor Void Balaur’s interest in IVF clinics (likely for corporate espionage). Besides targeting IVF doctors, Void\n\nBalaur is also taking aim at academic researchers who study human and animal reproduction, which\n\ncould also support corporate espionage motives.\n\nHowever, we also suspect that Void Balaur is hungry for data and information on individuals and could\n\nbe looking to expand their current business offerings and explore new methods of providing services to\n\ncustomers. Offering individuals’ medical data is one example of this. Between May 23, 2020 and April 1,\n\n\n-----\n\n2021, Void Balaur targeted more than 50 employees of over 20 Russian IVF clinics. Furthermore, the group\n\nmost likely targeted employees of at least four other companies that offer genetic testing services. The\n\nthreat actor also showed an interest in compulsory health insurance companies in at least three republics\n\nof Russia. Finally, the group also targeted medical test labs, general physicians, and companies that\n\nsell medical equipment. Doctors and medical service providers possess a sizeable amount of sensitive\n\ninformation on their patients and there is likely a demand for this kind of data. Offering medical data would\n\nbe a natural addition to the services that Void Balaur is advertising today.\n\nWe already mentioned that Void Balaur offers sensitive telco data of individuals in some CIS countries,\n\nincluding text messages and cell tower log files. We also discussed possible ways Void Balaur could\n\nhave retrieved this kind of data, such as compromising either a telco company or some of their key\n\nemployees. For this, we have supporting evidence (shown in Table 6): the threat actor has targeted key\n\nengineers and managers working for mobile telco operators in Russia and Kazakhstan. The group has\n\nalso targeted two manufacturers of cellular equipment as well as companies that specialize in mobile\n\nsatellite communications and radio navigation (multiple times for the former).\n\nIn May and June 2021, Void Balaur added four Russian vendors of ATM and POS (Point of Sale) vendors\n\nand two Russian virtual cash register service providers to their target list. A couple of Russian fintech\n\ncompanies that offer innovative products were targeted as well. In our paper on the risks of open banking,\n\nwe warned that new fintech startups would be interesting targets for cybercriminals, because they have\n\nplenty of information on the finances of individuals and sales data from shops and malls.[17]\n\nIn Table 5, we mentioned that Void Balaur offers data on purchased plane tickets, except for charters\n\nand private planes. We also observed that the group has been targeting executives of various business\n\naviation companies. The reason why these executives were targeted could have been to fill the gap of\n\nVoid Balaur’s offerings on passenger details of charter flights and private planes.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Cryptocurrency Account Phishing\n\nVoid Balaur has been consistently trying to get access to wallets of various cryptocurrency exchange\n\nservices. For this activity, Void Balaur narrowly targets people who are interested in cryptocurrencies.\n\nStealing cryptocurrency is profitable and interesting to cybercriminals as the virtual money that is\n\nassociated with cryptocurrency can be transferred to wallets controlled by the criminals, where there is\n\nlittle chance of recovering the stolen goods.\n\nSince at least 2018, Void Balaur has set up numerous phishing sites related to various cryptocurrency\n\nexchange and cryptocurrency wallet sites. There is one service that stands out, however: EXMO. Some\n\nof Void Balaur’s phishing sites for EXMO user, like exmo[.]ms, were used for about three years, which is\n\na rather lengthy time. Besides this domain, Void Balaur set up several other domains for EXMO phishing.\n\nFigure 8. A Void Balaur phishing site that targets Exmo users\n\n\n-----\n\n|Phishing domain|Date created|Real domain|Description|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|advcash.com[.]ru|May 02, 2018|advcash.gi|Cryptocurrency exchange|\n|exmo[.]ms|May 03, 2018|exmo.com|Bitcoin exchange|\n|yobit[.]one|May 06, 2018|yobit.net|Ethereum exchange|\n|nicehash.com[.]cm|May 07, 2018|nicehash.com|Cryptocurrency mining|\n|cryptopia.co[.]cm|May 11, 2018|cryptopia.co.nz|Bitcoin exchange|\n|wex[.]so|May 11, 2018|wexinc.com|FinTech company|\n|binance.com[.]ht|May 19, 2018|binance.com|Crypto exchange|\n|wallet-cryptonator[.]ru|Sep 3, 2018|cryptonator.com|Cryptocurrency wallet|\n|bitpay.ru[.]com|Dec 17, 2019|bitpay.com|Bitcoin payment service provider|\n|trezor-live[.]com|Dec 17, 2019|trezor.io|Cryptocurrency wallet|\n|epayments[.]run|Jan 30, 2020|epayments.com|Financial services provider|\n|exmo.me[.]uk|Mar 26, 2021|exmo.com|Bitcoin exchange|\n\n\nTable 11. Phishing domain names of Void Balaur, targeting various cryptocurrency platforms\n\n\n-----\n\n## Working Times of Void Balaur\n\nWe were curious about the working habits of Void Balaur. We collected enough data to gain an idea of\n\nthe actor’s working hours. We plotted statistics on hours, weekdays, and months when Void Balaur was\n\nactive (Figures 9-13). We did this for both attacks on email addresses of Russian service providers and\n\nattacks on the email addresses of a major international email provider.\n\nIt appears that Void Balaur usually starts the working day around 6 a.m. GMT and works until around\n\n7 p.m. We saw hardly any activity from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. GMT. While Void Balaur is less active during\n\nweekends, the actor often works seven days a week and does not take long vacations such as during\n\nChristmas or in the summer. This is in contrast with an actor like Pawn Storm (APT28) who works during\n\nChristmas holidays, but often takes a break in the summer and during a period from the end of December\n\nuntil around mid-January.\n\n10%\n\n9%\n\n\n7%\n\n\n8%\n\n\n7%\n\n\n8% 8% 8% 8%\n7%\n\n\n7%\n\n\n5%\n\n\n5%\n\n\n4% 4%\n\n\n3%\n\n\n0%\n\n\n2%\n\n1%\n\n0%\n\n**4** **5** **6** **7** **8** **9** **10** **11** **12** **13** **14** **15** **16** **17** **18** **19** **20** **21**\n\nTime (GMT)\n\nFigure 9.

There is no clear vacation or holiday period in the chart.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware Activities of Void Balaur\n\n##### Z*Stealer\n\nAs first reported in the report by Amnesty International, Void Balaur has used malware against its targets\n\nas well. One file was downloaded from the command-and-control (C&C) server msoffice365[.]win and\n\nhad the SHA256 sum 5a2c9060f6cc1e6e0fd09b2b194631d2c7e7f024d9e2d3a9be64570e263f565f. An\n\nanalysis of this sample shows that it is a simple information stealer. The malware is highly tuned for\n\nstealing credentials from the following applications and software:\n\n- Instant messaging software: Pidgin, ICQ/QIP, Miranda, Psi, Jabber accounts\n\n- File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Secure Shell (SSH) software: FlashFXP, CuteFTP, FileZilla, SmartFTP,\n\nWS_FTP, WinSCP, Total Commander\n\n- Email clients: Outlook, Yandex, Thunderbird, Windows Live Mail, mail.ru, The Bat\n\n- Virtual Network Computng (VNC) software: RealVNC, TightVNC, TigerVNC, UltraVNC\n\n- Browser software: Opera, Chrome, Chromium, Torch, YandexBrowser, Comodo Dragon, Firefox,\n\nInternet Explorer, Amigo Browser, Sleipnir Browser, Safari\n\n- Remote Desktop Protocol software\n\nThe malware also has cryptocurrency wallet stealing capabilities related to:\n\n- MultiBit\n\n- Electrum\n\n- Terracoin\n\n- PPCoin\n\n- PrimeCoin\n\nThis kind of malware is perfect for the nature of business in which Void Balaur is involved. It can be used\n\nto steal sensitive data and it has a component for stealing cryptocurrency wallets.\n\n##### DroidWatcher malware\n\nThe Amnesty International report also mentioned that Void Balaur had been using Android malware such\n\nas DroidWatcher, an Android malware that has been around for a long time and is quite easy to find on\n\nthe internet.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe found a sample used by Void Balaur that communicated with one of their C&C servers\n\nat garant-help[.]com. The filename for that sample was “Rasmlar.apk”. It is interesting to\n\nnote that “rasmlar” means “photos” in Uzbek language. The sample had the SHA256 sum\n\n902c5f46ac101b6f30032d4c5c86ecec115add3605fb0d66057130b6e11c57e6.\n\nThe malware sample had several functions:\n\n- Transfering incoming/outgoing SMS and phone call logs\n\n- Phone call recording (exfiltration is done by email)\n\n- Taking screenshots at specified interval (exfiltration is done by email)\n\n- GPS position transfer at specified intervals\n\n- Notification of SIM card changes\n\n- Automatic silent updates\n\n- Remote control for phone settings\n\n- Spying on VK and WhatsApp\n\nThe version we found had been tweaked and modified, both for additional functions and to hide its\n\npresence better:\n\n- Anti-VM and anti-debug features have been added, based on public code.[18]\n\n- Addition of XMPP protocol (default XMPP channel admin name set to “opr6”) with Rooster client.[19]\n\n- Phone rooting functionalities based on public code “RootTools v3.2.”\n\n- Remote shell addition\n\n- Use of Websocket to send information\n\n- C&C fetching capabilities via a Twitter account\n\n- Additional spying capabilities for more Android apps:\n\nº Email : ru.mail\n\nº Messengers: imo, OK, Telegram, Viber\n\nThe malware sample had two predefined C&C servers configured, garant-help[.]com and\n\n192.168.35[.]40:3355 (possibly a leftover from internal testing).\n\nIt also had a Twitter account configured, “world181061401,” which has been taken down prior to our\n\ninvestigation.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Overlap with Pawn Storm\n\nWe started our investigation into Void Balaur because we initially suspected that copies of a dozen\n\nphishing emails we had received from a source were the work of Pawn Storm threat actors. We soon\n\nrealized that these campaigns belonged to a different group who we later called Void Balaur. However, we\n\ndid find a small, but clear overlap between Pawn Storm and Void Balaur during our research.\n\nWe have been following Pawn Storm campaigns since 2014, and have collected information on Pawn\n\nStorm targets throughout in all those years. We have seen that thousands of email addresses were\n\ntargeted either via spear phishing or credential phishing. This makes it possible for us to compare the\n\ncampaigns of Pawn Storm and Void Balaur and their targets.\n\nWhile there are clear differences between the two threat actors, we can also see some overlap. The\n\ndifference is that Void Balaur is a cybermercenary with a wide range of clientele. This makes the Void\n\nBalaur targets a lot more diverse than that of Pawn Storm. Void Balaur is often motivated by crime and\n\neconomic espionage while virtually all of the attacks launched by Pawn Storm that we have observed is\n\nmotivated by espionage, politics, geopolitics, and the military. We did not observe Void Balaur attacking\n\nmilitary targets except for one minister of defense, but we did see a substantial number of politicians\n\non their target list. The same holds true for journalists, activists, and religious leaders: Pawn Storm\n\naggressively targeted one particular group of religious leaders in 2014 to 2016; the same religious leaders\n\nwere on Void Balaur’s target list in 2020 and 2021.\n\n|Sector|Attacks by Pawn Storm|Attacks by Void Balaur|\n|---|---|---|\n|Military|Significant|Very few observed|\n|Defense industry|Significant|Very few observed|\n|Government|Significant|Moderate|\n|Diplomats|Significant|Moderate|\n|Politicians|Significant|Moderate|\n|Human rights activists|Significant|Significant|\n|Oligarchs|Moderate|Significant|\n|Journalists|Significant|Significant|\n|Religious leaders|Moderate|Moderate|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Sector|Attacks by Pawn Storm|Attacks by Void Balaur|\n|---|---|---|\n|Scientists|Significant|Significant|\n|Telco engineers|Not observed|Moderate|\n|ATM / PoS sellers|Not observed|Moderate|\n|Business aviation|Not observed|Moderate|\n|Lawyers|Not observed|Moderate|\n|IVF clinics|Not observed|Significant|\n|Medical|Not observed|Significant|\n|Fashion|Not observed|Significant|\n|Cryptocurrency|Not observed|Significant|\n|Long tail of various businesses|Not observed|Significant|\n\n\nTable 12. Comparing credential phishing attacks by Pawn Storm from 2014 to 2016 and Void Balaur\n\nfrom 2020 to 2021. Since 2020, Pawn Storm has been using brute force attacks on a wider scale.\n\nIn total, we have observed a dozen email addresses that were targeted by both Pawn Storm during the\n\nperiod of 2014 to 2015, and by Void Balaur from 2020 to 2021. Besides the religious leaders, we also saw\n\nattacks on diplomats, politicians and a journalist from both Pawn Storm and Void Balaur.\n\nGenerally, there is a clear overlap in the sectors that are being targeted by both groups as we have\n\nillustrated in the table above. However, there are clear differences as well: Based on our observations,\n\nVoid Balaur has targeted sectors that Pawn Storm is not active in. For example, Void Balaur has had long\n\nrunning campaigns against cryptowallet users and even some cryptoexchange platforms. In our research\n\non Pawn Storm, we never saw any significant targeting of cryptocurrency platforms.\n\n**Pawn Storm 2014** **Void Balaur 2020** **Exact**\n**Sector**\n**to 2016** **to 2021** **overlap**\n\nReligious leaders 5 12 5\n\nDiplomats (Ukraine) Many Several 3\n\nJournalists Many Many 1\n\nOther N/A N/A 2\n\nTable 13. Overlap in targets for Pawn Storm and Void Balaur\n\nAs we reported in 2020, Pawn Storm is still using the classic technique of sending credential phishing\n\nemails to gain access to mailboxes.[20] It also does large scale brute force attacks and password spray\n\nattacks via Tor, VPN networks, and occasionally, dedicated IP addresses. We don’t know if Void Balaur is\n\nalso trying to use brute force attacks on email account credentials.\n\n|Sector|Pawn Storm 2014 to 2016|Void Balaur 2020 to 2021|Exact overlap|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Religious leaders|5|12|5|\n|Diplomats (Ukraine)|Many|Several|3|\n|Journalists|Many|Many|1|\n|Other|N/A|N/A|2|\n\n\n-----\n\n## Outlook for the Cybermercenary Industry\n\nThe reality is that regular internet users cannot easily deter a determined cybermercenary. More than\n\nonce, media outlets have reported on advanced offensive tools in a cybermercenary’s arsenal being used\n\nagainst journalists and human rights activists. Some of these tools include so-called zero-click zero-day\n\nexploits, which do not require any user interaction to infect the target with malware.[21] While these tools\n\nmight be meant to be used in the fight against terrorism and organized crime, the reality is that they —\n\nknowingly or unknowingly — end up in the hands of threat actors who use it against unwitting targets.\n\nThe core issue that causes these recurring problems is that some countries may view cybermercenaries\n\nwithin their borders as strategic assets that can be used in multiple ways. First, the services and tools\n\nof cybermercenaries can be used in offensive attacks against terrorism and organized crime, and for\n\ntargeting foreign assets. Second, they can also be sold to other countries and used as an economic or\n\npolitical tool in foreign policy. Though this might benefit some countries, it also poses a tremendous risk\n\nof possible backlash when malicious elements use these tools. Even worse, tools that have been sold\n\noverseas might end up being used against citizens of the country that originally exported these tools.\n\nCitizens can pressure national lawmakers into implementing better regulations for the development and\n\nexport of cyberweapons for its national industry of cybermercenaries. This is not an easy task, but it’s\n\nlikely one of the few solutions that can better protect the public against cybermercenary attacks at the\n\ngovernment level. Cybermercenaries could also be made accountable for both their actions and the\n\ncyberweapons they export, as was advocated in a Microsoft blog post in 2020.[22]\n\n\n-----\n\n## Defending Against Cybermercenary Attacks\n\nDefending against cybermercenaries such as Void Balaur is not an easy task. The group claims it can\n\nretrieve sensitive data on individuals without user interaction and we have no reason to doubt that this\n\nbusiness proposition is a real one under certain circumstances.\n\nVoid Balaur sells private data such as emails and cell tower data to anyone who wants to pay for it. This\n\nmeans that users and organizations should carefully consider the security policies of their email and\n\nmobile providers to determine whether these services are fit for their needs and situation. Users should\n\nalso look into alternatives to two-factor authentication via SMS messages since Void Balaur also has\n\ninterception of SMS messages in its business offerings. We do not know how Void Balaur is intercepting\n\nSMS messages in Russia, but other threat actors have used tricks like SIM swapping to intercept SMS\n\nmessages.[23]\n\nWhile the techniques used by Void Balaur might be difficult to defend against, that doesn’t mean that\n\nsecurity best practices are rendered ineffective. In fact, observing simple security practices can go a long\n\nway in helping defend against cybermercenary groups like Void Balaur:\n\n- Use the email services of a reputable provider that is known to have robust security and have high\n\nprivacy standards\n\n- Use two-factor authentication for email and social media accounts, but instead of using SMS, consider\n\nthe use of an app or a device such as Yubikey instead\n\n- Use apps with end-to-end encryption for communications\n\n- Use encryption systems like Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) for communication involving sensitive\n\ninformation or dialogue\n\n- Permanently delete old, unneeded messages to prevent sensitive data from ending up in the hands\n\nof third parties in case the machine gets hacked\n\n- Consider using some of the features of mobile apps that allow for setting a time after which chats for\n\nboth the sender and receiver disappear\n\n- Use drive encryption on all computing devices\n\n- Turn off laptops and computers when not in use\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Appendices\n\n##### Appendix A\n\nThis Appendix shows how we linked the original phishing emails, which the spouse of a long-term Pawn\n\nStorm target received in early 2020, to Rockethack/Void Balaur.\n\n**URL** **Status** **Details**\n\n27g4dwjallqnzu0[.]space Privacy protected Spam URL\n\naccount-googl[.]com poxxpoz@pm.me Sender domain\n\nbflqj2xmpbwqkzpwg[.]fun Privacy protected Spam URL\n\nizwg17taoz9noedve[.]xyz Privacy protected Spam URL\n\nmyaccount.mail.sessionverify.com[.]ru Privacy protected Phishing site\n\noapjiyfybhj0jszll[.]fun Privacy protected Spam URL\n\nwnppid4qunpuwuvqk[.]fun Privacy protected Spam URL\n\nyen9y2flnrcbwsvy9[.]fun Privacy protected Spam URL\n\nTable A.1.

Passive DNS for IP address 51.83.97.40\n\nThe public SSH key of IP address 51.83.97[.]40 had the fingerprint\n\ncc:97:53:b8:51:52:d8:5f:fa:1e:39:db:2c:ce:12:6b between June 4, 2019 and June 24, 2019. A couple of\n\nthese websites moved to the IP address 134.209.86[.]7 later in 2019 (this IP address also hosted google\nactivity[.]pw, which we have previously related to Void Balaur in Appendix A). This establishes a direct link\n\nbetween the Amnesty International report, the eQualitie report and our research on Void Balaur.\n\n\n-----\n\nBesides this, we found that in 2020, Void Balaur targeted the editor-in-chief of one of the websites that\n\nwas attacked in 2018 and 2019, according to the eQualitie report.\n\n##### Appendix C\n\nThis appendix shows how we traced the activities of Void Balaur to the year 2015.

We\n\ncan relate these domain names to mx-delivery[.]com by looking at the pattern of hostnames in a large\n\ndatabase of passive DNS data.
