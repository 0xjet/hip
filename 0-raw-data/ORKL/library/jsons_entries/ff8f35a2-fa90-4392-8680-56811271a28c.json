    "plain_text": "# Not So Lazarus: Mapping DPRK Cyber Threat Groups to Government Organizations\n\n**[mandiant.com/resources/mapping-dprk-groups-to-government](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/mapping-dprk-groups-to-government)**\n\nMandiant believes that North Korea's cyber capability supports both long-standing and\nimmediate political and national security priorities, as well as financial goals. We assess most\nof North Korea's cyber operations, including espionage, destructive operations, and financial\ncrimes, are primarily conducted by elements within the Reconnaissance General Bureau.\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of State Security and United Front Department’s missions appear to\nplay limited roles in North Korea's cyber program. Open-source reporting often uses the\n_Lazarus Group title as an umbrella term referring to numerous North Korean cyber operators,_\nhowever, understanding the different institutions within this secretive hermit nation and how\nthey continue to evolve and share resources aids organizations in proactively defending from\nthese types of threats. Mandiant judges North Korea's intelligence apparatus possesses the\nflexibility and resilience to create cyber units based on the needs of the country. Additionally\noverlaps in infrastructure, malware, and tactics, techniques and procedures indicate there\nare shared resources amongst their cyber operations.\n\nFigure 1 is an assessed cyber organizational chart derived from various OSINT, targeting\npatterns, malware usage, and defector reporting that shines some light onto a seeming\nchange taking place within the North Korean cyber ranks.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Assessed cyber structure of DPRK cyber programs\n\n## United Front Department\n\n[UFD is an organization sponsored by the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea.](https://www.globalasia.org/v9no1/cover/forks-in-the-road-to-reform-socio-economic-changes-under-kim-jong-un_glyn-ford)\nAlthough it is comprised of operating groups that may not correspond to well-known “cyber\nactors”, the organization's overall effort centers around disseminating pro-regime\npropaganda targeting South Korea, likely to undermine their primary geopolitical rival. The\n\n\n-----\n\n[UFD typically leverages online information operations, including an army of cyber trolls, to](https://news.sky.com/story/north-korea-creates-army-of-cyber-trolls-10437459)\npromote pro-DPRK political narratives on web forums as well as conventional propaganda\nefforts, such as leaflets and radio broadcasts targeting their southern neighbor.\n\nIn a two-year span, these “cyber trolls” allegedly hijacked South Korean users accounts\nonline and posted an estimated 68k propaganda items in web forums and various comment\nsections in an attempt to amplify the regimes’ message in South Korea. This organization’s\n[end goal is the establishment of pro-North Korean groups within South Korea](https://www.dia.mil/Portals/110/Documents/News/North_Korea_Military_Power.pdf)\n\n## Ministry of State Security\n\nThe MSS is the DRPK's primary counterintelligence service which operates as an\nautonomous part of the government and is primarily tasked with domestic counterespionage\nand overseas counterintelligence activities. APT37's previous campaigns targeting foreign\njoint venture partners as well as threat activity against defectors, defector support agencies,\nand humanitarian organizations indicate APT37's activities most likely align with the agenda\nof MSS.\n\n**[APT37's assessed primary mission is covert intelligence gathering in support of](https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/20-00002247)**\nDPRK's strategic military, political, and economic interests. A lack of recent, significant\nactivity from this actor matched with an uptick in similar targeting from units within the\n[“Kimsuky” actor-set may indicate a shift or consolidation within North Korea’s cyber](https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/21-00027289)\nleadership.\n\n## Reconnaissance General Bureau: An Overview\n\nThe [RGB is the North Korea's primary foreign intelligence service, responsible](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/151216_Cha_NorthKoreasCyberOperations_Web.pdf)\nfor intelligence collection and clandestine operations. It is believed to be comprised of six\nbureaus:\n\n1 Bureau: Operationsst\n2nd Bureau: Reconnaissance\n3 Bureau: Foreign Intelligencerd\n5 Bureau: Inter-Korean Affairsth\n6 Bureau: Technologyth\n7 Bureau: Support th\n\n\n_[Notably, a 4 bureau does not exist likely because the number \"4\" is considered taboo.th](https://gwangjunewsgic.com/arts-culture/korean-myths/the-deadly-4/)_\n\nWhile cyber efforts are a portion of the organization's overall operations, the 3 Bureaurd\n(Foreign Intelligence) and 5 Bureau (Inter-Korean Affairs) appear to hold the “meat andth\npotatoes” of North Korea's cyber program.\n\n\n## Reconnaissance General Bureau: 3 Bureaurd\n\n\n-----\n\n_Lab 110…the focal point for the Lazarus Group Umbrella_\n\nTEMP.Hermit, APT38, and Andariel are likely subordinate to [Lab 110. Lab 110 is likely an](https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2019/06/Art_08_The-All-Purpose-Sword.pdf)\n[expanded and reorganized version of \"Bureau 121,\" often noted as North Korea's primary](https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2019/06/Art_08_The-All-Purpose-Sword.pdf)\nhacking unit. Lab 110 contains some elements that are most closely aligned with the\n[organization, publicly reported as \"Lazarus Group.\" Open-source reporting often uses the](https://risky.biz/laz/)\nLazarus Group title as an umbrella term, referring to numerous clusters that we track\nseparately. Although TEMP.Hermit is most frequently aligned with Lazarus Group reporting,\noften times, researchers and open sources lump all three of these actor sets – and\nsometimes even all of the North Korean APTs – merely as “Lazarus Group”.\n\n**TEMP.Hermit is an actor that has been around since at least 2013. Their operations**\nsince that time are representative of Pyongyang's efforts to collect strategic intelligence\nto benefit North Korean interests. This actor targets government, defense,\ntelecommunications, and financial institutions worldwide and the term “Lazarus Group”\nrefers most often to this cluster of activities.\n**APT38 is a financially motivated group sponsored by North Korea, known for significant**\nfinancial compromises and its use of destructive malware against financial institutions.\nThe group has been attributed to sophisticated compromises targeting Interbank Fund\nTransfer Systems to steal millions of dollars at a time across multiple countries\nworldwide.\n**Andariel focuses its operations on foreign businesses, government agencies, financial**\nservices infrastructure, private corporations, and businesses, as well as the defense\nindustry. The group also conducts cyber crime likely as an extra source of income to\n[the government as we observed in signature malware activity by this actor; however,](https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/21-00014321)\ntargeting of military and government personnel appear to be the primary focus.\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Bureau 325 was publicly announced in January 2021, when the structure of the RGB](https://www.dailynk.com/english/kim-jong-un-directly-handling-results-new-covid-19-hacking-organization-work/)**\nlikely [shifted in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The new unit](https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/21-00009967)\nappeared to take on primarily conducting intelligence gathering operations against\nCOVID-19 research and manufacturing organizations. Defector reporting also stated\nthat in January 2021, the unit was not fully operational. Overtime, we have observed\n[sharing of efforts and \"non-COVID-19\" type of activities, indicating this actor may be](https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/21-00009967)\n[nearing the milestone that defector reporting states, “...the group will soon begin ‘full-](https://www.dailynk.com/english/kim-jong-un-directly-handling-results-new-covid-19-hacking-organization-work/)\n_scale’ operations”. This newly formed Bureau 325 houses the DPRK COVID-19-_\n[focused unit and corresponds to activities tracked in the open source as “CERIUM”. We](https://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/21-00009967)\nsuspect that individuals from several previously tracked clusters – including\nTEMP.Hermit, and Kimsuky – were also drafted to Bureau 325 to respond to highpriority operations from DPRK leadership.\n\nOver time, we began to see this organization shift from “strictly COVID-19” efforts\nto the targeting of defectors, defense and governments, bloggers, media,\ncryptocurrency services, and financial institutions. This increase in\nresponsibilities indicates the group has quickly gained the confidence of DPRK’s\nsenior leadership and likely gained prominence. Defenders will continue to see\nBureau 325's fingerprints on more campaigns in the wild.\n\n## Reconnaissance General Bureau: 5 Bureauth\n\n\nThere are overlaps that indicate cyber elements of the UFD share interests regarding issues\non the Korean peninsula and share targeting overlaps with APT37; however, these extra\n[elements appear to be supplemental to the 5 Bureau’s overall mandate. th](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/151216_Cha_NorthKoreasCyberOperations_Web.pdf)\n\n**Kimsuky is an actor often conflated in OSINT that conducts targeted campaigns to**\ncollect strategic intelligence on geopolitical events and negotiations affecting the\nDPRK's interests. The actor primarily targets organizations in the U.S. and South\nKorea, including individuals working within the government, military, manufacturing,\nacademic, and think tank organizations that possess subject matter expertise in\ndefense and security, particularly nuclear security and nonproliferation policy. This\nthreat actor’s activities include collecting financial, personal, and client data specifically\nfrom academic, manufacturing, and national security industries in South Korea. The\nmost likely reason is for the purpose of setting up further infrastructure for cyber\nespionage operations, leveraging personas for phishing campaigns, or carrying out\nidentity theft and fraud.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe country's espionage operations are believed to be reflective of the regime's immediate\nconcerns and priorities, which is likely currently focused on acquiring financial resources\nthrough crypto heists, targeting of media, news, and political entities, information on foreign\nrelations and nuclear information, and a slight decline in the once spiked stealing of COVID\n\n-----\n\n19 vaccine research. Information collected in these campaigns will possibly be used to\ndevelop or produce internal items and strategies, as in vaccines, mitigations to bypass\nsanctions, funding for the country’s weapons programs, and so on. Additional information\ncontinues to be collected to determine the extent to which these groups operate and\nstreamline their operations. Being able to see though the intentional fog left by North Korean\nleadership, and able to identify targeting patterns that align to physical units allows for a\nproactive defense against these cyber operators. This effort is critical in a country where little\nis known to the outside world and defector reporting supplemented with cyber operations can\nhelp.\n\n\n-----",
