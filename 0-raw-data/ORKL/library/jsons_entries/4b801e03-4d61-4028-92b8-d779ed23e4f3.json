We thank the team at](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/04/goldmax-goldfinder-sibot-analyzing-nobelium-malware/)_\n_Microsoft and other partners for their great collaboration in tracking this actor._\n\n**Threat Detail**\n\nMandiant Threat Intelligence discovered a new backdoor uploaded by a U.S.-based entity to a public\nmalware repository in August 2020 that we have named SUNSHUTTLE. SUNSHUTTLE is written in\nGO, and reads an embedded or local configuration file, communicates with a hard-coded command\nand control (C2) server over HTTPS, and supports commands including remotely uploading its\nconfiguration, file upload and download, and arbitrary command execution. Notably, SUNSHUTTLE\nuses cookie headers to pass values to the C2, and if configured, can select referrers from a list of\npopular website URLs to help such network traffic “blend in.”\n\nThe SUNSHUTTLE backdoor file examined, “Lexicon.exe” (MD5:\n9466c865f7498a35e4e1a8f48ef1dffd), was written in GoLang. The file unpacks into MD5:\n86e89349fefcbdd9d2c80ca30fa85511.\nThe infection vector for SUNSHUTTLE is not known. It is most likely a second-stage backdoor\ndropped after an initial compromise.\nThe SUNSHUTTLE sample uses the actor-controlled server “reyweb[.]com” for C2.\n“Reyweb[.]com” is registered anonymously via NameSilo, a domain provider who accepts\nbitcoin payment and has been used for C2 registration by state-sponsored APTs in the past,\nincluding Russia-nexus actors and Iran-nexus APTs\n\nMandiant observed SUNSHUTTLE at a victim compromised by UNC2452, and have indications that it\nis linked to UNC2452, but we have not fully verified this connection.\n\n[Please see FireEye’s resource center for background on UNC2452 and the SUNBURST campaign.](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/sunburst-malware.html)\n\n**Outlook and Implications**\n\nThe new SUNSHUTTLE backdoor is a sophisticated second-stage backdoor that demonstrates\nstraightforward but elegant detection evasion techniques via its “blend-in” traffic capabilities for C2\ncommunications. SUNSHUTTLE would function as second-stage backdoor in such a compromise for\nconducting network reconnaissance alongside other SUNBURST-related tools.\n\n**Technical Annex**\n\nMandiant Threat Intelligence discovered a sample of the SUNSHUTTLE backdoor uploaded to an\nonline multi-Antivirus scan service. SUNSHUTTLE is a backdoor, written in GO, that reads an\nembedded or local configuration file, communicates with its C2 server over HTTPS and supports\n\n\n-----\n\ncommands including remotely updating its configuration, file upload and download, and arbitrary\ncommand execution.\n\nLexicon.exe (MD5: 9466c865f7498a35e4e1a8f48ef1dffd)\n\nC2: reyweb[.]com\nUNAVAILABLE (MD5: 86e89349fefcbdd9d2c80ca30fa85511)\n\nUnpacked version of 9466c865f7498a35e4e1a8f48ef1dffd\n\n**Infection Vector**\n\nFor the samples analyzed, the infection vector is not known.\n\n**Execution**\n\n_Execution Summary_\n\nSUNSHUTTLE is a backdoor written in GoLang. Once SUNSHUTTLE is executed, a high-level\ndescription of the execution is the following:\n\nConfiguration settings determined\nRequest a “session key” from the C2\nRetrieve the “session key” from the C2\n\nOnce a session key is retrieved, SUNSHUTTLE begins command request beaconing loop\nBegin command request beaconing\nResolve command and perform action\n\nThe SUNSHUTTLE sample analyzed retains the names of the routines used by the malware, which\ninclude the following:\n\nmain.request_session_key\n\nmain.define_internal_settings\n\nmain.send_file_part\n\nmain.clean_file\n\nmain.send_command_result\n\nmain.retrieve_session_key\n\nmain.save_internal_settings\n\nmain.resolve_command\n\n\n-----\n\nmain.write_file\n\nmain.beaconing\n\nmain.wget_file\n\nmain.fileExists\n\nmain.encrypt\n\nmain.decrypt\n\nmain.random\n\nmain.removeBase64Padding\n\nmain.addBase64Padding\n\nmain.delete_empty\n\nmain.Unpad\n\nmain.GetMD5Hash\n\nmain.Pad\n\n**Note: Throughout the SUNSHUTTLE backdoor, unique string identifiers are used to indicate the**\noperation being performed to the C2 via a Cookie header, and unique string identifiers are also used\nto validate and parse response content from the C2. These unique string values are thought to be\nunique and random per compiled sample.\n\n_Initial Execution_\n\nOnce executed, the SUNSHUTTLE backdoor enumerates the victim’s MAC address and compares it\nto a hardcoded MAC address value “c8:27:cc:c2:37:5a”. If a match is found the backdoor exits. The\nMAC address is likely a default MAC address for the Windows sandbox network adapter.\n\n\n-----\n\nMac address check\n\n\nFigure 1: Mac\n\naddress check\n_Configuration_\n\nIf the check is successful, the SUNSHUTTLE backdoor then enters a routine named\n“ main_define_internal_settings”, which handles creation of the configuration file if one doesn’t already\nexist in the directory from which SUNSHUTTLE is running. For the sample analyzed, the configuration\nfilename is “config.dat.tmp”. The configuration data is Base64 encoded and AES-256 encrypted using\nthe following key:\n\nhz8l2fnpvp71ujfy8rht6b0smouvp9k8\n\nThe configuration has the following example values when Base64 decoded and AES decrypted:\n\n48b9e25491e088a35105274cae0b9e67|515|0|0|TW96aWxsYS81LjAgKFdpbmRvd3MgTlQgMTAuMDsgV2luNjQ7IHg2NDsgcnY6NzUuMCkgR2V\nja28vMjAxMDAxMDEgRmlyZWZveC83NS4w\n\nThe configuration holds several values delimited by a “|” character, which are briefly described as\nfollows.\n\n\n-----\n\n48b9e25491e088a35105274cae0b9e67\n\nMD5 hash of the current timestamp calculated during execution.\n5-15\n\nLower/upper limits used to randomly generate sleep times as SUNSHUTTLE executes\n0\n\n0 or 1 — Utilize “blend-in” traffic requests. Internally called “false_requesting”\n0\n\nActivate execution timestamp (0 by default) — execution \"activates\" or continues if current\ntime is greater than the value in the configuration\nTW96aWxsYS81LjAgKFdpbmRvd3MgTlQgMTAuMDsgV2luNjQ7IHg2NDsgcnY6NzUuMCkgR2Vja2\n8vMjAxMDAxMDEgRmlyZWZveC83NS4w\n\nBase64-encoded User-agent used in HTTPS requests\nDecoded: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:75.0) Gecko/20100101\nFirefox/75.0\n\nIf set in the configuration, the “blend-in” traffic occurs as the malware executes and transitions through\nits routines. The following URLs are leveraged for the “blend-in” requests:\n\nhttps://reyweb[.]com/icon.ico\nhttps://reyweb[.]com/icon.png\nhttps://reyweb[.]com/script.js\nhttps://reyweb[.]com/style.css\nhttps://reyweb[.]com/css/style.css\nhttps://reyweb[.]com/css/bootstrap.css\nhttps://reyweb[.]com/scripts/jquery.js\nhttps://reyweb[.]com/scripts/bootstrap.js\nhttps://cdn.mxpnl[.]com/\nhttps://cdn.google[.]com/\nhttps://cdn.jquery[.]com/\nhttps://code.jquery[.]com/\nhttps://cdn.cloudflare[.]com/\n\n_Session Key Mechanism_\n\nSUNSHUTTLE performs initial requests to the C2 in order to request and then retrieve what it\ninternally refers to as a session key. The retrieved session key from the C2 appears to be RSA\ndecrypted using the following private key that is embedded in SUNSHUTTLE and believed to be\nunique per compiled sample. Analysis is on-going on how the decrypted session key is used, but it is\nlikely a session key used to encrypt content once SUNSHUTTLE transitions to its command-andcontrol routines.\n\n-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----MIIEowIBAAKCAQEA0Aj/3K3m/rKNESwUfHC9qAhnsNYA9bJ4HQ30DPsfPDvbbHZm\nUj5nyp2abjYZYMQbWa2+ZO4Ixgfdm0FzsAH/haKIN4sSkbw+YRESYW35MnMI3Adf\nmj/eK/yKNblyoe/7iWP3nz+y4Q/QI0L6BrF7VodTaDYtDup3iI+B5zjmhElf9Fmg\nS1JiDUgydz5VXJR/esv6hB7GMfEb/3sIAzv5qcwEvGK5HH1EzQ7zjauyhbsF9pHR\nzCFYlvW4OtaU0o3xjVufo5UwYRS5p/EFpof45zuJGLJ02cKUmxc0OX53t3Bn9WXY\naDDhYp/RPzywG8N9gTBv8rKxRIsFxxKu+8wK+QIDAQABAoIBAGe4hPDe13OXTBQK\n\n\n-----\n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\nAo2QPbN8RiltHeaAq0ZfrgwrQuP5fmigmBa5lOWID/eU2OLlvJGi\n-----END PRIVATE KEY--\nAfter the configuration is created or read from, SUNSHUTTLE enters a routine named\n“ main_request_session_key”. The malware will iterate over this routine until it’s successful, sleeping a\nperiod of time after each iteration.\n\nInside the “ main_request_session_key” routine, SUNSHUTTLE constructs an HTTPS request to its\nconfigured C2. Upon an HTTP 200 response from the request, the response data from the C2 is\nexpected to not contain the following string for the sample analyzed:\n\nywQdjLuHHC\n\nThe request_session_key routine returns a 1 if the string is not in the response and a -1 if it is in the\nresponse. If the result of the request_session_key is 1, SUNSHUTTLE will execute the\nretrieve_session_key routine.\n\nThe retrieve_session_key routine again contacts the C2 and downloads content that is expected to be\ndecrypted by the aforementioned embedded private key. The decrypted content is likely a session key\nused to encrypt content once SUNSHUTTLE transitions to its command-and-control routines.\n\n_Commanding_\n\nOnce a session key is retrieved from the C2, SUNSHUTTLE begins the beaconing and\n“resolve_command” routines in a loop. SUNSHUTTLE first issues a beacon to retrieve a command.\nAfter, SUNSHUTTLE will enter the routine “resolve_command”, which parses the response content to\ndetermine which command should be run. Available commands include remotely updating its\nconfiguration, file upload and download, and arbitrary command execution.\n\n\n-----\n\nResolve command graph\n\n\nFigure 2:\n\nResolve command graph\nThe content returned from the C2 after the “main_beaconing” routine is Base64 decoded and AES\ndecrypted. A check is performed to ensure the decrypted content doesn’t contain the following string:\n\nCp5RTQ31R1\n\nAs noted, it is likely these strings are unique per sample and randomly generated at compilation.\n\nThe decrypted content is parsed for certain unique strings.\n\n**Unique string in decrypted response** **Meaning**\n\n**zSsP2TSJJm3a** Update sleep range — save config\n\n**aQJmWJzXdYK721mGBI3U** Update “false requesting” value – save config\n\n**W5VYP9Iu2uyHK** Update C2 URL and User-agent – save config\n\n\n-----\n\n**3487wD9t2OZkvqdwRpqPeE** Send current timestamp to C2\n\n**ubFxROBRwfswVRWNjLC** Update \"activation\" timestamp in the config — save config\n\n**TMuhGdA9EHY** Upload file to C2 if the file exists\n\n**1kG4NaRX83BCMgLo38Bjq** Execute command – return “EXECED” if successful\n\n**hB0upT6CUmdRaR2KVBvxrJ** Execute command – return results/output\n\n**N/A (other string criteria met)** Provides terminal command execution\n\n**N/A (other string criteria met)** Download file from C2\n\n**Files Dropped**\n\nAfter successful execution of the malware, it drops the following files to the victim’s system:\n\n<current_directory>\\config.dat.tmp (MD5: Dynamic)\n\nEncrypted configuration file\n\n**Persistence Method**\n\nThe SUNSHUTTLE malware was not observed setting its own persistence. It is likely the persistence\nis set outside of the execution of SUNSHUTTLE.\n\n**Network Communications**\n\nSUNSHUTTLE uses the cookie header to pass values to the C2. Additionally, a referrer is selected\nfrom the following list, presumably to make the traffic blend in if traffic is being decrypted for\ninspection:\n\nThe cookie headers vary slightly depending on the operation being performed. The following is an\nexample request to the C2 from the “request_session_key” routine.\n\n**Victim to C2**\n\nGET /assets/index.php HTTP/1.1\n\nHost: reyweb[.]com\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:75.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/75.0\n\nCookie: HjELmFxKJc=48b9e25491e088a35105274cae0b9e67; P5hCrabkKf=gZLXIeKI;\niN678zYrXMJZ=i4zICToyI70Yeidf1f7rWjm5foKX2Usx; b7XCoFSvs1YRW=78\n\nReferer: www.facebook.com\n\nAccept-Encoding: gzip\n\nWithin the Cookie header, these values represent the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n**HjELmFxKJc=48b9e25491e088a35105274cae0b9e67**\n\nTimestamp MD5 contained within the configuration\n**P5hCrabkKf=gZLXIeKI**\n\n“P5hCrabkKf=” contains a unique string based on which routine is performing the request\n(see the following table).\n**iN678zYrXMJZ=i4zICToyI70Yeidf1f7rWjm5foKX2Usx**\n\n“i4zICToyI70Yeidf1f7rWjm5foKX2Usx” is hard coded within the SUNSHUTTLE backdoor.
