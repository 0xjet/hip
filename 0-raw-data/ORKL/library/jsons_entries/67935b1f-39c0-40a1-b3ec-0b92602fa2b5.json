    "plain_text": "# RAT Gone Rogue: Meet ARS VBS Loader\n\n**flashpoint-intel.com/blog/meet-ars-vbs-loader/**\n\n[Blogs](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog)\n\nBlog\n\n\nApril 16, 2018\n\n\nMalicious VBScript has long been a fixture of spam and phishing campaigns, but until\nrecently its functionality has been limited to downloading malware from an attacker-controlled\nserver and executing it on a compromised computer.\n\nMalicious VBScript has long been a fixture of spam and phishing campaigns, but until\nrecently its functionality has been limited to downloading malware from an attacker-controlled\nserver and executing it on a compromised computer.\n\nResearchers at Flashpoint have seen and analyzed a unique departure from this norm in\nARS VBS Loader, a spin-off of a popular downloader called SafeLoader VBS that was sold\nand eventually leaked in 2015 on Russian crimeware forums.\n\nARS VBS Loader not only downloads and executes malicious code, but also includes a\ncommand and control application written in PHP that allows a botmaster to issue commands\nto a victim’s machine. This behavior likens ARS VBS Loader to a remote access Trojan\n(RAT), giving it behavior and capabilities rarely seen in malicious “loaders”, i.e. initial\ninfection vector malware families used to install subsequent payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 1: ARS VBS Loader s administrative login portal.Image 1: ARS VBS Loader s\n_administrative login portal._\nThe new loader has been spammed out in email attachments enticing victims with lures in\nsubject lines related to personal banking, package shipments, and toll road notifications.\nShould a victim interact with the attachment and launch it, analysts say numerous types of\ncommodity malware could be installed, including the AZORult information-stealing malware.\n[AZORult was also used in campaigns targeting more than 1,000 Magento admin panels; in](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/?p=5021)\nthose attacks, the malware was used to scrape payment card information from sites running\nthe popular free and open source ecommerce platform.\n\nARS VBS Loader targets only Windows machines and supports Windows 10, according to\nposts to a Russian-speaking forum going back to December. Previously, another loader\ncalled FUD ASPC Loader, first advertised in May 2017, contained similar functionality but not\nWindows 10 support.\n\nThe loader is also likely to side-step detection by signature-based antivirus and intrusion\ndetection systems because of the relative ease in which attackers can obfuscate VBScript,\nFlashpoint analysts said. Obfuscation through a variety of means allows attackers to hide\nmalware; if the malware is obfuscated with encryption or packing, it’s exponentially more\ndifficult for antivirus to sniff out malicious code, for example.\n\nOnce the ARS VBS Loader executes on a victim’s computer, it immediately creates a\nnumber of entries in nearly a dozen autorun locations, including registry, scheduled tasks,\nand the startup folder, ensuring persistence through reboots. ARS VBS Loader will connect\nto the attacker’s server, sending it system information such as the operating system version\nname, computer user name, RAM, processor and graphics card information, a randomly\ngenerated ID for infection tracking, and machine architecture information.\n\nImage 2: ARS VBS Loader submits check in information to the C2 in GET and POST\nparameters.\n**_Image 2: ARS VBS Loader submits check in information to the C2 in GET and POST_**\n_parameters._\nThe botmaster, meanwhile, can remotely administer commands to bots through the PHP\ncommand-and-control application. Communication with the command-and-control server is\ncarried out in plaintext over HTTP, making it easy to spot, Flashpoint analysts said.\n\nThe malicious code that runs on the victim’s machine is written entirely in VBScript and\ncontains functionality for updating and deleting itself, and deploying plugins such as a\ncredentials stealer, or launching application-layer denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against\nwebsites, and loading additional malware from external websites.\n\nThe most common command spotted by analysts is download, which instructs bots to\ndownload and execute malware from a supplied URL. There is also the plugin command\nwhere plugins that steal passwords or capture desktop screenshots can be pushed to\n\n\n-----\n\ncompromised computers.\n\nThe DDoS command is also noteworthy because it’s a unique capability; analysts said they\nhave not seen this command used in the wild. The command tells bots to send a specified\namount of HTTP POST requests to a particular URL. Since this is a simple application layer\nflooding attack, it is currently unknown how successful this attack would be against targets in\nthe wild, analysts said, adding that it would be easy to spot such traffic because the same\nhardcoded POST values are sent in the HTTP flood.\n\nImage 3: Example DDoS HTTP flooding traffic from an infected bot.Image 3: Example\n_DDoS HTTP flooding traffic from an infected bot._\nAnalysts caution that users should be vigilant about not opening email attachments from\nunknown sources, and that it’s likely ARS VBS Loader will continue to be an effective initial\ninfection vector for spam campaigns.\n\nTo download the indicators of compromise (IOCs) for the ARS VBS Loader, [click here.](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ARS-VBS-Loader-IoCs.pdf)\n\nTo download the Yara rule for the ARS VBS Loader, [click here.](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ARS-VBS-Loader-Yara-Rule.pdf)\n\n\n-----",
