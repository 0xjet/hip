    "plain_text": "# MoqHao Part 1.5: High-Level Trends of Recent Campaigns Targeting Japan\n\n**[team-cymru.com/blog/2021/08/11/moqhao-part-1-5-high-level-trends-of-recent-campaigns-targeting-japan/](https://team-cymru.com/blog/2021/08/11/moqhao-part-1-5-high-level-trends-of-recent-campaigns-targeting-japan/)**\n\nS2 Research Team View all posts by S2 Research Team August 11, 2021\n\n[Having last looked at the MoqHao (or Roaming Mantis) malware family in January 2021, we](https://team-cymru.com/blog/2021/01/20/identifying-phishing-infrastructure-targeting-banking-customers/)\ndecided to take another look at the activities of this threat group. MoqHao targets Android\nusers, usually via an initial attack vector of phishing SMS messages, with a particular focus\non Japan, South Korea and Taiwan (although MoqHao’s focus continues to expand).\n\nSeveral researchers are actively tracking MoqHao’s phishing infrastructure, with IOCs posted\ndaily on forums such as Twitter. For example:\n\n[@KesaGataMe0](https://twitter.com/KesaGataMe0)\n[@NaomiSuzuki](https://twitter.com/NaomiSuzuki_)\n[@ninoseki](https://twitter.com/ninoseki)\n[@papa anniekey](https://twitter.com/papa_anniekey)\n\n\n-----\n\nThese researchers do a great job of identifying the latest campaigns, and this blog will not\nseek to duplicate their findings. Instead, we will use Team Cymru’s internet telemetry data to\nexamine a subset of MoqHao campaigns, from the period April – June 2021, to provide\nadditional insight into their scale and regularity.\n\nThis blog will be the first in a series which looks at various elements of the MoqHao infrastructure,\nbeginning first with users targeted in Japan.\n\nDuck DNS\n\nMoqHao commonly uses domains generated through the dynamic DNS service Duck DNS\nfor its first-stage delivery infrastructure. The hosting IP addresses for these domains appear\nto be limited to MoqHao whilst campaigns are active, shared hosting is rarely observed.\n\nThe domains utilized are generally a mix of randomly generated strings, with some spoofing\nof related entities. For example, amongst the domains used in this research were a number\nthat spoofed NTT Docomo, a Japanese mobile phone operator. A regular expression can be\nused for matching on these domains:\n\n[a-z]{10}.duckdns.org – e.g., docomoawbr.duckdns.org\n\nThe domain and hosting IP address pairs used in this research are shared on our public\n[GitHub.](https://github.com/team-cymru/iocs/tree/master/moqhao)\n\nNetwork Telemetry\n\nA set of hosting IP addresses, assigned to three providers, were used as the seeds for this\nanalysis:\n\nHDTIDC Limited – South Korea\nOphidian Network Limited – Ukraine\nZenlayer Inc – United States\n\nAll the IP addresses were identified within Team Cymru’s internal Passive DNS data sets and\nwere observed hosting first-stage domains of the format described above. The IPs appear to\nbe active for several days (on average around 14 days) hosting multiple domains, which\nupdate on a much more frequent basis. Therefore, blocklists based on individual domain\nnames are not an effective countermeasure to this threat.\n\nThe table below provides a summary of the hosting IP addresses, including details on when\nthey were first reported in open source, when victim traffic first appeared within Team\nCymru’s data holdings and the total number of victim connections observed.\n\n\n**IP Address** **Whois** **First**\n**Reported**\n\n\n**Traffic First**\n**Seen**\n\n\n**Traffic**\n**Volume**\n\n\n128.14.75.50 ZEN-ECN, US 03 April 2021 03 April 2021 188\n\n\n-----\n\n103.80.134.151 HDTIDC LIMITED,\nKR\n\n103.80.134.153 HDTIDC LIMITED,\nKR\n\n103.80.134.171 HDTIDC LIMITED,\nKR\n\n\n03 April 2021 10 April 2021 1,432\n\n03 April 2021 29 April 2021 10,024\n\n03 April 2021 15 May 2021 3,713\n\n\n87.120.36.215 OPI-NET-LTD, UA 24 May 2021 25 May 2021 10,001\n\n107.148.191.22 ZEN-ECN, US 26 May 2021 25 May 2021 622\n\n\n103.80.134.177 HDTIDC LIMITED,\nKR\n\n\n27 May 2021 26 May 2021 2,009\n\n\n165.3.91.227 ZEN-ECN, US 29 May 2021 29 May 2021 61\n\n165.3.91.228 ZEN-ECN, US 01 June 2021 31 May 2021 184\n\n\n103.80.134.178 HDTIDC LIMITED,\nKR\n\n103.80.134.180 HDTIDC LIMITED,\nKR\n\n\n05 June 2021 05 June 2021 1,389\n\n15 June 2021 15 June 2021 2,794\n\n\n**Table 1: MoqHao Distribution Infrastructure Summary**\n\nAs can be seen, there is generally a close proximity between distribution servers becoming\nactive (receiving victim communications) and them being reported on Twitter – usually one\nday or less.\n\nHDTIDC LIMITED, KR\n\nTo account for differences in our coverage between the three providers used for first-stage\ndomain hosting, we focused further on the six IP addresses within 103.80.134.0/24 assigned\nto HDTIDC Limited.\n\n**Comment: With all things being equal in terms of the (inferred) destination of the traffic**\nanalysed, we can discern more accurate patterns in the data.\n\nLooking at inbound connections on TCP/80 sourced from IP addresses assigned to\nJapanese broadband/telecoms providers, we can see a daily average of around 200-300\npotential victim connections to the distribution servers. On 29 April a spike in activity was\nnoted, lasting for around 10 days – coinciding with the beginning of the Golden Week holiday\nperiod in Japan.\n\nIt is possible that the actors behind MoqHao increased their phishing activities to coincide\nwith this period and thus generated more victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe figure below shows daily connections to the distribution IP addresses in combination\nwith when each of these was seen active (outside of these periods of activity there were zero\nconnections observed).\n\n**Figure 2: Daily Connections to MoqHao IPs**\n\nWhen we looked more specifically at where these potential victims were located, based on\ngeolocation data, we found communications emanating from across Japan with large\nclusters focused on the main population centres.\n\nThe following figures provide a snapshot of victim locations, at a high level, during the period\nof analysis – clustered around Tokyo, Kyoto/Osaka/Nagoya and Fukuoka.\n\n**Specific details of victim communications have been shared with JPCERT through our**\n**outreach team.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3: MoqHao Victims – Tokyo**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: MoqHao Victims – Kyoto/Osaka/Nagoya**\n\n**Figure 5: MoqHao Victims – Fukuoka**\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this first blog, we have looked at some high-level details of a subset of recent MoqHao\ncampaigns, providing an insight into the consistent nature of the threat actors activities – with\nvictims connecting to distribution servers throughout the analysis period. We have\nestablished a minimum number of around 200-300 victim connections per day, based on our\ncoverage of six distribution servers assigned to HDTIDC Limited in South Korea.\n\nWe have also hopefully brought to your attention several trustworthy commentators to follow\nfor daily updates on MoqHao indicators.\n\nIn future blogs on this subject, we will continue to track the broad trends surrounding\nMoqHao, as well as diving deeper into the various stages on the malware’s network\ninfrastructure.\n\nWe welcome any thoughts or feedback through our Twitter page – [@teamcymru_s2](https://twitter.com/teamcymru_S2)\n\n\n-----",
