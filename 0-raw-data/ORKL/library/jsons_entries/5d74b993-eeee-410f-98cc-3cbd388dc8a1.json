Additionally, because there is a high demand for novel ways to distribute mobile\nmalware, several malicious actors claim that their droppers could help other cybercriminals disseminate their malware on Google Play Store,\n[resulting in a dropper-as-a-service (DaaS) model.](https://www.prodaft.com/m/reports/BrunHilda_DaaS.pdf)\n\nIn the latter part of 2021, we found a malicious campaign that uses a new dropper variant that we have dubbed as DawDropper. Under the\nguise of several Android apps such as Just In: Video Motion, Document Scanner Pro, Conquer Darkness, simpli Cleaner, and Unicc QR\nScanner, DawDropper uses Firebase Realtime Database, a third-party cloud service, to evade detection and dynamically obtain a payload\ndownload address. It also hosts malicious payloads on GitHub. As of reporting, these malicious apps are no longer available on Google Play\nStore.\n\nFigure 1. DawDropper malicious apps previously available on Google Play Store\nWe explore the technical details of the new DawDropper dropper, look at the brief history of banking trojans released in early 2022 that use\nmalicious droppers, and discuss cybercriminal activities related to DaaS in the deep web in this entry.\n\n## DawDropper technical analysis\n\nBased on our observation, DawDropper has variants that drop four types of banking trojans, including Octo, Hydra, Ermac, and TeaBot. All\nDawDropper variants use a Firebase Realtime Database, a legitimate cloud-hosted NoSQL database for storing data, as their command-andcontrol (C&C) server and host malicious payloads on GitHub.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. DawDropper infection chain\n\nFigure 3. GitHub repository that hosts the Octo payload\n\nFigure 4. GitHub repository that hosts the Ermac payload\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. GitHub repository that hosts the Hydra payload\n\n## A similarity between Clast82 and DawDropper\n\n[Interestingly, we found that another dropper called Clast82, which was reported by CheckPoint Research in March 2021, also uses Firebase](https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/clast82-a-new-dropper-on-google-play-dropping-the-alienbot-banker-and-mrat/)\nRealtime Database as a C&C server.\n\nFigure 6. Data format fetched from C&C server (Source: com.abcd.evpnfree)\nThe DawDropper C&C server returns data similar to Clast82 data:\n\nFigure 7. DawDropper C&C server response\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Another DawDropper variant’s C&C server response that adds installation metrics and a prompt to install a new update\nThe Octo payload\n\n[DawDropper’s malicious payload belongs to the Octo malware family, which is a modular and multistage malware that is capable of stealing](https://news.trendmicro.com/2022/04/13/octo-android-banking-malware/)\n[banking information, intercepting text messages, and hijacking infected devices. Octo is also known as Coper, and it has been historically used](https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=14259)\nto target Colombian online banking users.\n\nBased on our analysis, DawDropper’s Octo malware payload is similar to previously reported variants. The package uses programming\nlanguage keywords to obfuscate malicious functionalities.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. The same type of Octo payload packages deployed in March and June 2022\n\nOnce the Octo malware is successfully launched in the victim’s device and gains primary permissions, it will keep the device awake and\nregister a scheduled service to collect and upload sensitive data to its C&C server. It also uses virtual network computing (VNC) to record a\nuser's screen, including sensitive information such as banking credentials, email addresses and passwords, and PINs. The malware also\ncauses a user’s screen to turn black by turning the device’s backlight off and turns off the device’s sound to hide malicious behavior.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. The Octo malware infection chain\n[The malware can also disable Google Play Protect (which goes through a device’s apps and checks for malicious behavior) and collects user](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853?hl=en)\ndata, including an infected mobile phone’s Android ID, contact list, installed apps, and even text messages.\n\nA brief history of banking droppers in early 2022\n\nTo better understand this trend of banking trojans being distributed via malicious droppers, we must look back at how droppers have been\npopping up on Google Play Store since the beginning of 2022, analyze how each of these droppers vary from one another and evolve, and\nlearn how cybercriminals are disseminating them.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Timeline of banking trojans distributed via droppers in the first half of 2022\n**Main differences among banking droppers**\n\nAlthough these banking droppers have the same main objective — to distribute and install malware on victims’ devices — we have observed\nthat there are marked differences in how these banking droppers implement their malicious routines. For example, the banking droppers that\nwere launched earlier this year have hard-coded payload download addresses. Meanwhile, the banking droppers that have been recently\nlaunched tend to hide the actual payload download address, at times use third-party services as their C&C servers, and use third-party\nservices such as GitHub to host malicious payloads.\n\n**Banking dropper name and release date** **Dynamic address** **Third-party storage** **Encrypted payload**\n\n\n**[Vultur dropper](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-play-app-dropped-vultur-banking-trojan-on-android-handsets/)**\n\nJan 12, 2022\n\n(com.privacy.account.safetyapp)\n\n**[Sharkbot dropper](https://threatpost.com/google-play-bitten-sharkbot/179252/)**\n\nJan 14, 2022\n\n(com.pagnotto28.sellsourcecode.supercleaner)\n\n**[Octo dropper (Gymdrop dropper)](https://threatfabric.com/blogs/octo-new-odf-banking-trojan.html)**\n\nFeb 17, 2022\n\n(com.moh.screen)\n\nFeb. 6, 2022\n\n(Vizeeva.fast.cleaner)\n\n**[Ermac dropper (DawDropper)](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131705/malware/ermac-2-0-android-banking-trojan.html)**\n\nMar 25, 2022\n\n(com.qaz.universalsaver)\n\n**TeaBot dropper**\n\nApr 3, 2022\n\n(com.zynksoftware.docuscanapp)\n\nFeb 11, 2022\n\n(com.scanner.buratoscanner)\n\n**Hydra dropper (DawDropper)**\n\nApr 23, 2022\n\n(com.casualplay.leadbro)\n\n\n✓\n\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n(Firebase Realtime Database)\n\n✓\n\n(GitHub)\n\n✓\n\n(Firebase Realtime Database)\n\n\n✓\n\n(GitHub)\n\n✓\n\n(GitHub)\n\n✓\n\n(GitHub)\n\n\n-----\n\n✓\n\n(GitHub)\n\n\nHydra dropper (Gymdrop dropper)\n\nMay 30, 2022\n\n(com.anatolijserba.docscanner)\n\nOcto dropper (DawDropper)\n\nJun 28, 2022\n\n(com.scando.qukscanner)\n\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\n(Firebase Realtime Database)\n\n\nThe Vultur dropper (SHA-256: 00a733c78f1b4d4f54cf06a0ea8cc33604512d6032ef4ef9114c89c700bfafcf), also known as Brunhilda  was first\nreported as a DaaS at the end of 2020.

However, TeaBot uses another GitHub\nrepository to get the download address, in contrast to DawDropper, which uses a Firebase Realtime Database.\n\n## DaaS dark web activities\n\n[In our investigation of banking trojans using droppers, we observed that one of the droppers that were first reported in 2021, Gymdrop, is](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/deceive-the-heavens-to-cross-the-sea.html)\nconnected to a management panel (trackerpdfconnect[.]com and smartscreencaster[.]online) that cybercriminals can use to manage both the\ndropper and the payload. We also found Gymdrop being advertised in a dark web forum as a typical DaaS.\n\nFigure 16. Gymdrop\n\nmanagement panel of the Hydra dropper (Source: m0br3v/Twitter)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17. The Gymdrop admin panel login page being featured in an underground forum in February 2022\n\n## Conclusion and security recommendations\n\nCybercriminals are constantly finding ways to evade detection and infect as many devices as possible. In a half-year span, we have seen how\nbanking trojans have evolved their technical routines to avoid being detected, such as hiding malicious payloads in droppers. As more banking\ntrojans are made available via DaaS, malicious actors will have an easier and more cost-effective way of distributing malware disguised as\nlegitimate apps. We foresee that this trend will continue and more banking trojans will be distributed on digital distribution services in the future.\n\nTo avoid falling prey to malicious apps, users should adopt the following security best practices:\n\nAlways check app reviews to see if users voice out unusual concerns or negative experiences.\nApply due diligence when looking into app developers and publishers. Avoid downloading apps from suspicious-looking websites.\nAvoid installing apps from unknown sources.\n\n[Mobile users can help minimize the threats posed by these fraudulent apps by using Trend Micro Mobile Security Solutions to scan mobile](https://go2.trendmicro.com/geoip/mobile-security)\ndevices in real time and on demand to detect malicious apps or malware to block or delete them. These apps are available for both Android\nand iOS.\n\nIndicators of compromise (IOCs)\n\n**DawDropper**\n\n\nSHA-256 Package name Release\ndate\n\n\nDetection
