    "plain_text": "# Three major hacking forums ban ransomware ads as some ransomware gangs shut down\n\n**[therecord.media/three-major-hacking-forums-ban-ransomware-ads-as-some-ransomware-gangs-shut-down/](https://therecord.media/three-major-hacking-forums-ban-ransomware-ads-as-some-ransomware-gangs-shut-down/)**\n\nMay 17, 2021\n\nIn the aftermath of the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, the underground cybercrime\necosystem is reshuffling, with ransomware gangs becoming pariahs.\n\nThree hacking forums have now banned ransomware ads, three ransomware leak sites have\ngone down, and two other ransomware groups have announced plans to stop operating in\npublic and go “private.”\n\nThe news comes after US President Joe Biden hinted last week in press conferences that\nthe US would take action against ransomware gangs after the Colonial cyberattack shut\ndown a major pipeline that transported fuel for around 45% of the US East Coast, prompting\nthe US to trigger a rare state of national emergency.\n\n## Hacking forum bans\n\nThe first to crack under this pressure were the hacking forums, places where criminal gangs\ngather to advertise services, find partners, or share knowledge.\n\nIn a post from the site’s admin calling the ransomware community greedy and toxic, XSS\nwas [the first forum to ban ransomware ads last week.](https://therecord.media/popular-hacking-forum-bans-ransomware-ads/)\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: The Record\nA day later, the admins of the [Exploit forum issued a similar ban, followed a few hours later](https://twitter.com/ddd1ms/status/1393299489784467458)\n[by the operators of the RAID forum.](https://twitter.com/Bank_Security/status/1393307992674668553)\n\nImage: Recorded Future\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: The Record\nThe three sites are today’s top destinations for most cybercrime groups and where,\nhistorically, ransomware gangs have posted and maintained forum threads advertising their\nservices and looking for partners.\n\nWhile XSS and Exploit hosted ads for the larger ransomware gangs, RAID usually hosted\nads for ransomware groups entering the scene, which used the forum to create a reputation\nbefore moving to the larger XSS and Exploit.\n\n## Ransomware gangs scatter\n\nBut the forum bans on ransomware ads also signaled to ransomware gangs that their\noperations had crossed a line, and they reacted accordingly.\n\nThe first to go was Darkside, the ransomware gang that orchestrated the Colonial Pipeline\nattack. In a message posted on their website, the group said they lost control of some of their\nservers and some of the money they gathered from ransom payments.\n\nWhile it is unclear if the group had servers taken down by US authorities or if the group\nperformed an “exit scam,” the group has abandoned its operations. Ironically, in a report\npublished on Friday, security firm AdvancedIntelligence said that even if the Darkside group\ntried to stay under the radar more than any other ransomware gang, they failed by hitting the\nwrong target in Colonial.\n\nBut by that time, the ball got rolling. With the XSS and Exploit bans in place and with\nDarkside disappearing, other gangs took the hint.\n\nHours after Darkside went down, the operators of the REvil and Avaddon ransomware\nstrains announced major changes to operations. In posts spotted by McAfee’s [John Fokker,](https://twitter.com/John_Fokker/status/1393225076846301186)\nthe two ransomware gangs said they planned to stop advertising on forums altogether and\n\n\n-----\n\nenter a private state, where they work with existing partners and through recommendations.\n\nIn attempts to avoid pressure from law enforcement, both groups also posted messages\nonline claiming that they will not attack sensitive social sectors like healthcare, educational\ninstitutes, and the government networks of any country. However, if they’ll stick to these rules\nremains to be seen.\n\nImage: Recorded Future\n\nImage: John Fokker\nBut REvil and Avaddon went private because they had a large network of affiliates\n(collaborators) with which they could work and continue carrying out attacks.\n\nSmaller groups that didn’t have similar partnerships didn’t have this option. So, over the\nweekend, two ransomware gangs—Ako (Razny) and Everest—appear to have chosen to\nshut down.\n\nNo, I noticed the extortion site for Everest ransomware go down yesterday, but I wasn't\nsure if it was offline or just flaky bulletproof hosting. Yesterday I was getting some weird\nGoogle CAPTCHA stuff for AKO/RANZY, now nothing. I think we have…a thing.\n[https://t.co/P52XaNSpXo](https://t.co/P52XaNSpXo) [pic.twitter.com/EKeA1seEvv](https://t.co/EKeA1seEvv)\n\n[— Allan “Ransomware Sommelier🍷” Liska (@uuallan) May 16, 2021](https://twitter.com/uuallan/status/1393922221219909634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile this reporter was told by several industry sources that there are attempts to take down\nsome of these group’s sites, the Ako site shutdown appears to be voluntary, as the gang’s\nformer site purposely redirected users to Google rather than go down as the Darkside and\nEverest ones.\n\n## Ransomware gangs to move into the shadows\n\nAlthough some ransomware gangs appear to have now ceased operations, things are not,\nhowever, this positive. Security experts fully expect that the individuals behind these\noperations to continue operating in the cybercriminal underground.\n\nEven if ransomware ads are now banned, the aforementioned forums also host ads from\n“initial access brokers,” which sell access to “hacked networks.”\n\nThis is important because, for the past year, ransomware gangs and initial access brokers\nhave partnered and worked to orchestrate attacks together.\n\nJust because the forums have now banned ransomware ads doesn’t mean that ransomware\ngangs won’t continue operating on these forums, and they won’t reach out to initial access\nbrokers in private and continue their partnerships, as before.\n\nThe only thing the ransomware ad ban did was to push ransomware gangs more into the\nshadows. They don’t intend to go away. The monetary rewards are just too big, and further\ndisruption in their ecosystem is needed, and, as some experts have suggested, more\npressure needs to be applied to the cryptocurrency financial entities that often help these\ngroups launder their profits.\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
