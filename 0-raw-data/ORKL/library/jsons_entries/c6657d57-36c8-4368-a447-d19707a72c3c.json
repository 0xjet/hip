By analyzing Trigona\nransomware binaries and ransom notes obtained from VirusTotal, as well as information from Unit 42 incident response, we determined that\nTrigona was very active during December 2022, with at least 15 potential victims being compromised. Affected organizations are in the\nmanufacturing, finance, construction, agriculture, marketing and high technology industries.\n\nUnit 42 researchers identified two new Trigona ransom notes in January 2023 and two in February 2023. Trigona’s ransom notes are unique;\nrather than the usual text file, they are instead presented in an HTML Application with embedded JavaScript containing unique computer IDs\n(CID) and victim IDs (VID).\n\n[Palo Alto Networks helps detect and prevent Trigona ransomware with the following products and services: Cortex XDR,](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/p/XDR) [Prisma Cloud and](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud)\n[Next-Generation Firewalls (including cloud-delivered security subscriptions such as WildFire) and through incident response.](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/ngfw)\n\n**Related Unit 42 Topics** **[Ransomware,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/ransomware/)** **[Ransomware Threat Report,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/ransomware-threat-report/)** **[CryLock](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/crylock/)**\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nTrigona Overview\n\nRansomware Analysis\n\nRansomware Binary\n\nRansom Note\n\nVictimology\n\nLeak Site Analysis\n\nSimilarities to CryLock Ransomware\n\nTools and Techniques\n\nTTPs\n\n\n-----\n\nCo c us o\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nProduct Protection Guide\n\n## Trigona Overview\n\n[The first mention of Trigona, also the name of a family of stingless bees, comes from a tweet by security researchers in late October 2022.](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1587581807595249666)\n[Malware samples were passed to BleepingComputer, which in turn published a blog post on the ransomware on Nov. 29, 2022. Unit 42](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trigona-ransomware-spotted-in-increasing-attacks-worldwide/)\nconsultants also have seen Trigona firsthand in the course of incident response.\n\nUnit 42 researchers have observed Trigona’s threat operator engaging in behavior such as obtaining initial access to a target’s environment,\nconducting reconnaissance, transferring malware via remote monitoring and management (RMM) software, creating new user accounts and\ndeploying ransomware.\n\n## Ransomware Analysis\n\n### Ransomware Binary\n\nUnit 42 obtained and analyzed a sample of the Trigona ransomware binary, named svhost.exe. Upon execution, the ransomware binary uses\nTDCP_rijndael (a Delphi AES library) to encrypt files. The ransomware then appends the ._locked file extension, modifies registry keys to\nmaintain persistence, and drops ransom notes.\n\nThe ransomware binary supports the following command line arguments:\n\n**Argument** **Description**\n\n/full Performs all functions of the ransomware. Encrypts both local and network files. Creates two registry keys for persistence,\none for the ransomware binary and another for the ransom note.\n\n/!autorun Skips creation of registry keys for persistence\n\n\n/test_cid\n“test”\n\n/test_vid\n“test”\n\n/p, /path\n“path”\n\n\nOverwrites default victim generated CID and replace with “test” value\n\nOverwrites default VID and replace with “test” value\n\nEncrypts only files contained within specified path\n\n\n/!local Does not encrypt local system files, only encrypts files on local network\n\n/!lan Does not encrypt local network files, only encrypts files on local system\n\n\n/autorun_only\n“path”\n\n\nCreates registry key for persistence only. Allows for optional “path” to be provided to override default path, does not encrypt\nfiles\n\n\nThe ransomware establishes persistence through the creation of two keys in CurrentVersion\\Run. Keys found in CurrentVersion\\Run contain\nreferences to programs that will execute when a user logs in.\n\nOne key executes the ransomware binary whenever the user logs in, ensuring that the encryption process would resume upon reboot. The\nother key ensures that the ransom note is opened every time the user logs in.\n\n### Ransom Note\n\nTrigona’s ransom note is dropped to the system with the name how_to_decrypt.hta. The HTML code in this file contains embedded JavaScript\nfunctionality, which displays ransom note details as shown below in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Sample Trigona ransom note.\n\nUnit 42 researchers observed that the JavaScript within the ransom note contains the following information:\n\nA uniquely generated CID and VID\nA link to the negotiation Tor portal\nAn email address to contact.\n\nThe contact email shown below in Figure 2 is phandaledr@onionmail[.]org. We have also seen farusbig@tutanota[.]com used as the contact\nemail in other Trigona ransom notes.\n\nFigure 2. Embedded JavaScript\n\ncontaining campaign ID and victim ID.\n\n### Victimology\n\nBy looking at the victim ID in the embedded JavaScript in the Trigona ransom notes, we were able to identify at least 15 potential victims that\nwere compromised in December 2022. We also identified two new Trigona ransom notes in January 2023 and two in February 2023.\n\nTrigona ransomware has been linked to compromises impacting multiple organizations worldwide, in sectors including manufacturing, finance,\nconstruction, agriculture, marketing and high technology. The companies impacted were in the United States, Italy, France, Germany, Australia\nand New Zealand.\n\n### Leak Site Analysis\n\nWhen Trigona was first observed, there was no evidence of this group using a leak site for double extortion. Their ransom note pointed the\nvictims to their negotiation portal instead. During the investigation of this ransomware family, we observed that a researcher identified a leak\nsite attributed to Trigona hosted on the IP address 45.227.253[.]99.\n\nUnit 42 researchers pivoted on the SSH key for 45.227.253[.]99 and identified three other IP addresses related to Trigona’s infrastructure:\n\n45.227.253[.]106\n45.227.253[.]98\n45.227.253[.]107\n\nEach IP shares the same SSH key of ecdsa-sha2-nistp256\nAAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBMjqeyIfJyuimtE414TBCxN+lHleN5/P3CNiD4uln5xyHjyw4muLePQj2y3yOJ7\n\n\n-----\n\ns 5 53[ ]99 a d 5 53[ ] 06 osted eb se e s o po t 8000, e 5 53[ ]98 a d 5 53[ ] 0 osted o eb\nservices.\n\nWe identified that 45.227.253[.]99 hosted a web server between Dec. 6, 2022, and Jan. 27, 2023. On Feb. 13, 2023, 45.227.253[.]106 started\nhosting a web server with the HTML title Trigona Leaks that was active until March 3, 2023.\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, each post contained the following information:\n\nA description of the company\nThe victim’s ZoomInfo page\nA description of the stolen data\nLinks to screenshots of example files\nA countdown timer\nA button to bid for the data.\n\nThe “@ Place a bid” button contained a mailto link to auction@mailthink[.]net. Mailthink is a service that allows users to create temporary,\ndisposable email addresses.\n\nFigure 3.\n\nTrigona leak site.\nWhile the leak site was active, there were four victims:\n\n[Victim 1 has a near-duplicate post on the BlackCat (ALPHV) leak site and a countdown timer of over 300 days. Security researchers at](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/blackcat-ransomware/)\nArete Incident Response recently observed Trigona leveraging BlackCat’s reputation and data leak site to pressure and extort victims. It’s\n**unclear whether Victim 1 was impacted by Trigona.**\nVictim 2 has a duplicate post on the BlackCat (ALPHV) leak site and a countdown timer of over 300 days. It’s unclear whether Victim 2\nwas impacted by Trigona.\nVictim 3 has an associated ransom note on VirusTotal and a countdown timer of just over 30 days. Unit 42 assesses with high confidence\nthat Victim 3 was impacted by Trigona\n\n\n-----\n\nct s ot e t o ed o a y ot e a so a e ga g s ea s te a d as a cou tdo t e o o e 300 days U t d d ot de t y\nany associated ransom notes and it’s unclear whether Victim 4 was impacted by Trigona.\n\nThe countdown timers of over 300 days for Victims 1, 2 and 4 were well beyond the usual timeframe that we have observed in incident\nresponse cases where attackers demand payment, which is between two and four weeks.\n\nGiven the following features, the Unit 42 team believes with moderate confidence that the surface web leak page was a development\nenvironment to test out features before a possible move to the dark web:\n\nSeveral posts appear to be duplicates from the BlackCat leak site (as shown in Figure 4)\nSeveral of the countdown timers are considerably longer\nThe leak site is no longer available on the surface web\n\nFigure 4.\n\nComparison between Trigona leak site (left) and BlackCat (ALPHV) leak site (right).\n\n## Similarities to CryLock Ransomware\n\nTrigona operators share overlap in tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) with CryLock ransomware operators, suggesting that\nransomware threat actors that once deployed CryLock ransomware might have moved on to deploying Trigona ransomware. The email\nassociated with Trigona ransom notes analyzed by Unit 42 (phandaledr@onionmail[.]org) was mentioned in an online forum discussing\nCryLock ransomware, as shown below in Figure 5.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. A\n\nuser on SafeZone, a Russian anti-malware forum, seeking help for Crylock ransomware.\nBoth ransomware families also drop ransom notes in HTML Application format, named how_to_decrypt.hta. There are also similarities in the\nransom message, including:\n\nTheir claim that all “documents, databases, backups, and other critical” files and data were encrypted\nAES as their choice of cryptographic algorithm\nTheir statement that “the price depends on how soon you will contact us”\n\n## Tools and Techniques\n\nUnit 42 has seen evidence of malicious activity associated with Trigona originating from a compromised Windows 2003 server, followed by the\nthreat operators executing NetScan for internal reconnaissance.\n\n### NetScan\n\nUnit 42 analysts recovered the NetScan output and noticed that it contained Cyrillic characters, as shown below in Figure 6. Changing the\ndefault language of NetScan to Russian is an option that can be configured upon initial installation.\n\nFigure 6. NetScan output that operator(s) left on disk containing Cyrillic characters.\n\nAfter conducting reconnaissance, Trigona operators used Splashtop – a remote access and management (RMM) tool – to transfer the\nfollowing malware into the target’s environment.\n\nThreat actors often abuse, take advantage of or subvert legitimate products for malicious purposes. This does not necessarily imply a flaw or\nmalicious quality to the legitimate product being abused.\n\n### Start.bat\n\nStart.bat is a batch script that performs the following activities:\n\nIt creates a new folder at C:\\temp\nIt copies other malicious batch and EXE files from a compromised internal Server Message Block (SMB) server to the newly created\ntemp folder\nIt executes Turnoff.bat\n\n\n-----\n\n### u o bat\n\nTurnoff.bat is a cleanup script used to remove evidence of the attack on a system. It does so by performing the following activities:\n\nClearing the Recycle Bin of any mounted drive\nAttempting to use sc stop and taskkill to stop over 100 services related to various areas ranging from remote desktop tools to Windows\nDefender\nAttempting to stop services related to VMware, Hyper-V and SQL\nEnding several running tasks related to the stopped services mentioned above\nClear Windows Event Logs (using wevutil cl)\nDeleting Volume Shadow Copies\nDisconnecting all network drives\n\nUnit 42 researchers have observed that cleanup scripts from other threat actors are usually smaller and more specific to the tools used by that\nactor. The scattershot variety of services and tasks that turnoff.bat stops could suggest that the tool is attempting to ensure that a wider variety\nof systems are encrypted.\n\n### Newuser.bat\n\nNewuser.bat is a batch script that creates a new user with the name fredla and the password Qw123456. It then adds the fredla user to the\nlocal groups Administrator and Remote Desktop Users. Threat actors sometimes create privileged user accounts to keep access to target\nsystems without having to install persistent remote access tools on the system.\n\n### DC2.exe\n\nDC2.exe contains a password protected version of Mimikatz, which is a tool used for extracting sensitive information such as passwords and\nauthentication credentials from a Windows operating system.\n\nThis version of Mimikatz has been compressed using UPX. While UPX is often legitimately used to reduce file size, we have observed threat\nactors utilizing UPX and other packing programs to evade static detection of the underlying payload.\n\nThe tool is also password protected, which adds an extra layer of complexity when ascertaining the program’s functionality.\n\nWhen the executable is run, the threat actor is prompted for a password to continue. The MD5 hash of the password is then calculated, and if it\nis equal to 4dbf44c6b1be736ee92ef90090452fc2, the program will continue running.\n\nThe password required to achieve the MD5 hash is boris.\n\nAmong its many legitimate uses, Unit 42 researchers have most often observed Mimikatz being leveraged maliciously by threat actors in the\nfollowing ways:\n\nCredential Loading\n\nMimikatz loads credentials from various sources such as Windows memory, Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)\nprocess and the Windows registry.\nCredential Dumping\n\nThe tool then extracts and dumps the credentials, including usernames and passwords, hashes, and Kerberos tickets to the screen\nor to a file.\nCredential Manipulation\n\nMimikatz allows the user to manipulate the dumped credentials, such as changing passwords, creating new user accounts and\nadding users to groups.\nCredential Injection\n\nThe tool can also inject the manipulated credentials into other processes, allowing the user to impersonate another user and gain\naccess to restricted resources.\n\n### DC4.exe\n\nDC4.exe is a small, UPX-packed password protected binary that generates and executes an embedded batch file. Like DC2.exe, the password\nto allow the binary to run is boris.\n\nUpon execution, the batch file makes the following changes to the system:\n\n1. Disables the User Account Control (UAC) and sets cmd.exe as a debugger for HelpPane.exe, utilman.exe, Magnify.exe and sethc.exe.\n\nThis is a common method of creating a “Sticky Keys backdoor” that allows for the creation of a command prompt with NT\nAUTHORITY\\SYSTEM privileges.\n2. Opens specific ports on the firewall to allow remote desktop connections using the netsh command.\n3. Modifies the Windows registry to allow remote desktop connections.\n\n\n-----\n\nC eates a e use accou t t t e use a e sys a d pass o d 5 806, a d adds t s use to t e d st ato a d e ote\nDesktop Users groups.\n\n### DC6.exe\n\nDC6.exe is an installer for the publicly available tool Advanced Port Scanner, wrapped up in an Inno Setup installer package. Inno Setup is a\nfree software installer for Windows programs. Advanced Port Scanner is a tool that is commonly abused by threat actors for network scanning\nand mapping, for lateral movement and discovery purposes.\n\nWrapping Advanced Port Scanner in Inno Setup adds an additional layer of obfuscation to the code, and it is likely to evade static signature\ndetection, forcing dynamic analysis to determine functionality rather than relying on traditional static code signatures.\n\n## TTPs\n\n**Tactic / Technique** **Notes**\n\n**TA0002 Execution**\n\n\nT1072.

For DC6.exe,\nTrigona hid the installer for Advanced Port Scanner within Inno Setup installer to evade static signature\ndetection.\n\n\nT1112.

Inhibit System\nRecovery\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\nTrigona operators use Turnoff.bat to delete Volume Shadow Copies.\n\n\nTrigona is a newer strain of ransomware that, to date, has had minimal coverage by security news articles. This lack of security community\nawareness allows Trigona to discreetly attack victims while other higher-profile ransomware operations dominate the news headlines. We hope\nthat shining a light on Trigona and its uncommon technique of using password-protected executables to obfuscate malware helps defenders\nbetter protect their organizations against this threat.\n\nDue to the stream of victims identified by the Unit 42 team and Trigona’s currently developing leak site, the operator and/or affiliates behind the\nransomware likely will continue (and possibly even ramp up) its malicious activity.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers receive protections from Trigona threats through the following products:\n\n[WildFire currently lists all known binaries of Trigona as malicious, which will trigger alerting within Prisma Cloud and](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/wildfire) [Cortex XDR.](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/p/XDR)\nPrisma Cloud will detect any instance of this malware being executed through properly configured Defender agents using Wildfire.\n\nAdditionally, Prisma Cloud Defender agents can be installed on Windows 2016 and 2019 servers, as well as on Windows Docker\nContainer hosts.\n\nIf you think you may have been compromised or have an urgent matter, get in touch with the [Unit 42 Incident Response team or call:](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/contact-unit42.html)\n\nNorth America Toll-Free: 866.486.4842 (866.4.UNIT42)\nEMEA: +31.20.299.3130\nAPAC: +65.6983.8730\nJapan: +81.50.1790.0200\n\nPalo Alto Networks has shared these findings, including file samples and indicators of compromise, with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance\n(CTA) members.
