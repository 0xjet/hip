    "plain_text": "# Novel Confucius APT Android Spyware Linked to India- Pakistan Conflict\n\n**[blog.lookout.com/lookout-discovers-novel-confucius-apt-android-spyware-linked-to-india-pakistan-conflict](https://blog.lookout.com/lookout-discovers-novel-confucius-apt-android-spyware-linked-to-india-pakistan-conflict)**\n\nThe Lookout [Threat Intelligence team has discovered two novel Android surveillanceware –](https://www.lookout.com/products/threat-intelligence?utm_source=BL&utm_medium=BL&utm_campaign=WW-MU-MU-MU-MU-P_NON-HornbillSunBird)\nHornbill and SunBird. We believe with high confidence that these surveillance tools are used\nby the advanced persistent threat group (APT) Confucius, which first appeared in 2013 as a\nstate-sponsored, pro-India actor primarily pursuing Pakistani and other South Asian targets.1\n2\n\nWhile primarily known for desktop malware, the Confucius group was previously reported to\nhave started leveraging mobile malware in 2017, with the Android surveillanceware\nChatSpy.3 However, our discovery of SunBird and Hornbill shows that Confucius may have\nbeen spying on mobile users up to a year before it started using ChatSpy.\n\nTargets of these tools include personnel linked to Pakistan’s military, nuclear authorities, and\nIndian election officials in Kashmir. Hornbill and SunBird have sophisticated capabilities to\nexfiltrate SMS, encrypted messaging app content, and geolocation, among other types of\nsensitive information.\n\n\n-----\n\n_SunBird has been disguised as applications that include:_\n\n_Security services, such as the fictional “Google Security Framework”_\n_Apps tied to specific locations (“Kashmir News”) or activities (“Falconry Connect” and_\n_“Mania Soccer”)_\n_Islam-related applications (“Quran Majeed”)._\n\n_The majority of applications appear to target Muslim individuals._\n\nLookout named Hornbill after the Indian Grey Hornbill, which is the state bird of Chandigarh\nand where the developers of Hornbill are located. SunBird’s name was derived from the\nmalicious services within the malware called “SunService” and the sunbird is also native to\nIndia.\n\n## Malicious functionality and impact of both SunBird and Hornbill\n\nHornbill and SunBird have both similarities and differences in the way they operate on an\ninfected device. While SunBird features remote access trojan (RAT) functionality – a malware\nthat can execute commands on an infected device as directed by an attacker – Hornbill is a\ndiscreet surveillance tool used to extract a selected set of data of interest to its operator.\n\nBoth of the malware can exfiltrate a wide range of data, such as:\n\nCall logs\nContacts\nDevice metadata including phone number, IMEI/Android ID, Model and Manufacturer\nand Android version\nGeolocation\nImages stored on external storage\nWhatsApp voice notes, if installed\n\nBoth malware are also able to perform the following actions on device:\n\nRequest device administrator privileges\nTake screenshots, capturing whatever a victim is currently viewing on their device\nTake photos with the device camera\nRecord environment and call audio\nScrape WhatsApp messages and contacts via accessibility services\nScrape WhatsApp notifications via accessibility services\n\n## SunBird-specific functionality\n\nSunBird has a more extensive set of malicious capabilities than Hornbill. It attempts to\nupload all data it has access to at regular intervals to its command and control (C2) servers.\nLocally on the infected device, the data is collected in SQLite databases which are then\n\n\n-----\n\ncompressed into ZIP files as they are uploaded to C2 infrastructure.\n\nSunBird can exfiltrate the following list of data, in addition to the list above:\n\nList of installed applications\nBrowser history\nCalendar information\nBlackBerry Messenger (BBM) audio files, documents and images\nWhatsApp Audio files, documents, databases, voice notes and images\nContent sent and received via IMO instant messaging application\n\nIn addition to the list of actions above, SunBird can also perform the following actions:\n\nDownload attacker specified content from FTP shares\nRun arbitrary commands as root, if possible\nScrape BBM messages and contacts via accessibility services\nScrape BBM notifications via accessibility services\n\n_Samples of SunBird have been found hosted on third-party app stores, indicating one_\n_possible distribution mechanism. Considering many of these malware samples are trojanized_\n_– as in they contain complete user functionality – social engineering may also play a part in_\n_convincing targets to install the malware. No use of exploits was observed directly by_\n_Lookout researchers._\n\n\n-----\n\n## Hornbill-specific functionality\n\nIn contrast, Hornbill is more of a passive reconnaissance tool than SunBird. Not only does it\ntarget a limited set of data, the malware only uploads data when it initially runs and not at\nregular intervals like SunBird. After that, it only uploads changes in data to keep mobile data\nand battery usage low. The upload occurs when data monitored by Hornbill changes, such\nas when SMS, or WhatsApp notifications are received or calls are made from the device.\n\nHornbill is keenly interested in the state of an infected device and closely monitors the use of\nresources. For example, if the device is low on memory, it triggers the garbage collector. In\naddition to the list of exfiltrated data mentioned earlier, Hornbill also collects hardware\ninformation. For example, the malware can check if a device’s screen is locked, the amount\nof available internal and external storage and whether WiFi and GPS are enabled.\n\nHornbill only logs location information if it deems the changes to be significant enough from\nthe previously recorded location – if the difference between the corresponding latitudes and\nlongitudes differ by more than 0.0006 which is roughly 70 metres.\n\nData collected by Hornbill is stored in hidden folders on external storage. Once call\nrecordings or audio recordings are uploaded to C2 infrastructure they are deleted from the\ndevice to avoid suspicion.\n\n_List of hidden folders Hornbill creates and stores data to be exfiltrated to C2 infrastructure._\nHornbill uses a unique set of server paths to communicate to C2 infrastructure. These are\nlisted below along with what action Hornbill takes when sending HTTP POST requests to\neach.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe operators behind Hornbill are extremely interested in a user’s WhatsApp\ncommunications. In addition to exfiltrating message content and sender information of\nmessages, Hornbill records WhatsApp calls by detecting an active call by abusing Android’s\naccessibility services. The exploitation of Android’s accessibility services in this manner is a\ntrend we are observing frequently in Android surveillanceware. This enables the threat actor\nto avoid the need for privilege escalation on a device.\n\nLastly, Hornbill searches for and monitors activity on any documents stored on external\nstorage with the following suffixes: \".doc\", \".pdf\", \".ppt\", \".docx\", \".xlsx\", \".txt\". Whenever a\ndocument is created, opened, closed, modified, moved or deleted, this action is logged by\nHornbill. Functionality exists to modify this list of suffixes, but is incomplete in the samples we\nhave observed. The latest samples of Hornbill show that this malware threat may still be\nunder development.\n\n## Development timelines\n\nThe newest Hornbill sample was identified by Lookout’s app analysis engine as recently as\nDecember 2020, suggesting the malware may still be active today. Both ChatSpy and\nHornbill’s packaging dates appeared to have been tampered with, but we first observed them\nin January 2018 and May 2018 respectively.\n\nLookout first observed SunBird in January 2017, but unlike the other two malware families,\nthe packaging dates appear legitimate, indicating the malware was likely in development\nbetween December 2016 and early 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Hornbill, which Lookout first saw in May 2018, is actively deployed. We observed new_\n_samples as recently as December 2020. The first SunBird sample was seen as early as_\n_2017 and as late as December 2019._\n\n## Targeting\n\nTo better understand who SunBird may have been deployed against, we analyzed over\n18GB of exfiltrated data that was publicly exposed from at least six insecurely configured C2\nservers. All data uploaded to the C2 infrastructure included the locale of the infected devices.\nThis information, combined with the data content, gave us extensive insight into who was\nbeing targeted by this malware family and the kind of information the attackers were after.\n\nSome notable targets included an individual who applied for a position at the Pakistan\nAtomic Energy Commission, individuals with numerous contacts in the Pakistan Air Force\n(PAF), as well as officers responsible for electoral rolls (Booth Level Officers) located in the\nPulwama district of Kashmir.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Based on the locale and country code information of infected devices and exfiltrated content,_\n_we think SunBird may have roots as a commercial Android surveillanceware. The data_\n_included information on victims in Europe and the United States, some of which appear to be_\n_targets of spouseware or stalkerware. It also included data on Pakistani nationals in_\n_Pakistan, India and the United Arab Emirates that we believe may be targeted by Confucius_\n_APT campaigns between 2018 and 2019._\n\n## Malware development and commercial surveillance roots\n\nBoth Hornbill and SunBird appear to be evolved versions of commercial Android surveillance\ntooling. Hornbill seems to be derived from the same code base as a previously active\ncommercial surveillanceware product known as MobileSpy. 5 It is unclear how the\ndevelopers of Hornbill acquired the code, but the company behind MobileSpy, Retina-X\nStudios, shut down their surveillance software products in May 2018 after being hacked\ntwice. 6 Links between the Hornbill developers indicate they all appear to have worked\ntogether at a number of Android and iOS app development companies registered and\noperating in or near Chandigarh, Punjab, India. In 2017, one developer claimed to be\nworking at India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on their\nLinkedIn profile.\n\nSunBird looks to have been created by Indian developers who also produced another\ncommercial spyware product, which we dubbed BuzzOut. 7 The theory that SunBird’s roots\nlay in stalkerware was also supported by the content found in the exfiltrated data we\nuncovered. The data included information on stalkerware victims, as well as Pakistani\nnationals living in Pakistan and traveling in the UAE and India. This data suggests that\n\n\n-----\n\nSunBird could have been sold to an actor that selectively deployed it to gather intelligence on\n[targeted individuals. Similar behavior was observed with Stealth Mango and Tangelo, two](http://stealth-mango/?utm_source=BL&utm_medium=BL&utm_campaign=WW-MU-MU-MU-MU-P_NON-HornbillSunBird)\nnation state mobile surveillanceware Lookout researchers discovered in 2018. 8\n\n## Exfiltrated data\n\nDuring this investigation, we were able to access exfiltrated data for SunBird whose C2\ninfrastructure had been insufficiently secured.\n\n_This is a breakdown of types of data SunBird exfiltrated. This data is from publicly-accessible_\n_exfiltrated content exposed on SunBird C2 servers for 5 campaigns between 2018 and 2019._\n_We found another 12 GB of data exfiltrated on another C2 server 23.82.19[.]250. The default_\n_language of this server was set up as Chinese when discovered by Lookout researchers._\n_This may be a false flag or may have been altered by a third party. This also makes it difficult_\n_to confirm if all of the data originated from infections of actual target devices._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Frequency of infected devices’ locale and country code settings (translated to languages and_\n_countries) as packaged within publicly-accessible exfiltrated data. This data includes both the_\n_Confucius APT targets and spouseware victims of SunBird._\n\n**_Left:One particular SunBird C2 server was found to also be exposing a log file containing IP_**\n_addresses of those that logged into the administrator panel. The majority of these were_\n_distributed throughout India. Right: Geo-location data captured from a publicly-exposed_\n_database found on another Sunbird C2 IP 23.82.19[.]250. Almost all data stored on this_\n_server referenced phone numbers of various locations in northern India. The second most_\n_common region for phone numbers was Pakistan._\nWithin the exfiltrated data, one particular victim caught our interest. This individual was using\nWhatsApp to correspond with someone applying for a position at the Pakistan Nuclear\nRegulatory Authority in 2017. In 2018, messages were uncovered from someone applying for\na position at the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission.9\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditional exfiltrated data from late 2018 and early 2019 indicated that SunBird was being\nused to monitor Booth Level Officers10 responsible for field-level information regarding\nelectoral rolls in the Pulwama district of Kashmir. This time and location is significant as\nPulwama suffered a suicide bombing attack in February 2019, which increased tensions\nbetween India and Pakistan. The start date of active monitoring of this target on C2 servers\ncoincided with the start of the Indian general elections held in April 2019.\n\n_Continuous data exfiltration data that occurred every ten minutes stopped at the end of 2018._\n_Aside from one brief upload in January 2019, it suddenly picked up again on the 11th of April_\n_2019. While this may be coincidence, this is also the same day that the Indian general_\n_elections of 2019 began.12_\n\nA total of 156 victims were discovered in this new dataset and included phone numbers from\nIndia, Pakistan and Kazakhstan.\n\n## Confucius connection\n\n_Hornbill application icons impersonate various chat and system applications._\nSimilar to previous Confucius tactics seen with ChatSpy, Hornbill samples often impersonate\nchat applications such as Fruit Chat, Cucu Chat and Kako Chat. The related C2\ninfrastructure communicates on port 8080, a pattern also seen on the desktop campaigns\ncarried out by Confucius.14\n\nThe Confucius group is well known for impersonating legitimate services to cover their tracks\nand confuse its victims. Naming malicious apps similar to legitimate ones may be an attempt\nto gain a target’s trust. For example, “kako chat” may have been named due to its similarity\nto KakaoTalk.15 However, Kako Chat’s C2 server (chatk.goldenbirdcoin[.]com) references a\ndefunct cryptocurrency by the same name.16 Cucu Chat may refer to a seemingly benign\ndating app of the same name that is available on third-party app stores such as APKPure.17,\n18 However, Cucu Chat communicates to the site http://wangu[.]xyz19 (also on port 8080)\n\n\n-----\n\nand itself appears to be an impersonation of Wangu, an application which advertises itself as\na chat app for Zimbabweans.20 The latest sample of Hornbill titled “Filos” trojanizes the\nMesibo21 Android application for legitimate chat functionality.\n\nDuring our investigation, we noticed that Hornbill C2 infrastructure hosted HTML resources\nconsistent with a commercial spyware page, but missing its image resources.\n\n_C2 servers for Hornbill were found to host HTML content from a commercial spyware._\nAdditionally, Hornbill carries out data exfiltration via the following unique set of\nserver paths:\n\nWe found that the patterns noted above also existed on another domain samaatv[.]online.\nAlthough Lookout has not directly observed an APK communicating to this domain, we think\none likely exists. samaatv[.]online has resolved to the IP address 91.210.107[.]104 since\nMay 2019, which encompasses the activity of this campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to this, we found the SunBird C2 domain pieupdate[.]online resolved to\n91.210.107.111 in between February 2019 and July 2019. This is also the timeframe in which\nwe observed active campaigns by SunBird on that infrastructure.\n\nWith the help of public reporting and Lookout’s dataset, we are confident that the Confucius\nAPT group is actively using the IPs between 91.210.107[.]103-91.210.107[.]112 to host a\nlarge portion of their infrastructure, both presently and in the past.\n\nAdditional open-source intelligence (OSINT) searches confirmed the above connections. We\nfound a publicly-accessible 2018 Pakistani government advisory warning of a desktop\nmalware campaign targeting officers and government staff. The campaign described in it\nused phishing emails that impersonated various government agencies to deliver malicious\nMicrosoft Word exploits. The Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for this campaign included\ndomains that were known Confucius infrastructure, leading us to believe the entire campaign\ncould be attributed to that group.\n\n_Official Report from Pakistan’s Federal Bureau of Revenue on Malicious Activity._\nA particular point of interest on the advisory IoC list, and crucial in confirming Confucius\nconnections, was pieupdate[.]online, a C2 server for malicious desktop activity as well as\nSunBird mobile malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Hornbill malware has unique file paths with which to communicate with C2 servers. They_\n_also display a unique Spyware HTML page. Lookout researchers uncovered another domain,_\n_samaatv[.]online, which shares the same unique file paths and Spyware HTML page found_\n_on a Hornbill C2 server, cucuchat[.]com. It is tied to known Confucius infrastructure by_\n_resolving to 91.210.107[.]104, in the Confucius IP range._\nWe are confident SunBird and Hornbill are two tools used by the same actor, perhaps for\ndifferent surveillance purposes.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge the apps described in this article were never distributed through\nGoogle Play. Users of Lookout security apps are protected from these threats.\n\nLookout Threat Advisory Services customers have already been notified with additional\n[intelligence on this and other threats.

We believe with high confidence that these surveillance tools are used\nby the advanced persistent threat group (APT) Confucius, which first appeared in 2013 as a\nstate-sponsored, pro-India actor primarily pursuing Pakistani and other South Asian targets.1\n2\n\nWhile primarily known for desktop malware, the Confucius group was previously reported to\nhave started leveraging mobile malware in 2017, with the Android surveillanceware\nChatSpy.3 However, our discovery of SunBird and Hornbill shows that Confucius may have\nbeen spying on mobile users up to a year before it started using ChatSpy.\n\nTargets of these tools include personnel linked to Pakistan’s military, nuclear authorities, and\nIndian election officials in Kashmir. Hornbill and SunBird have sophisticated capabilities to\nexfiltrate SMS, encrypted messaging app content, and geolocation, among other types of\nsensitive information.\n\n_SunBird has been disguised as applications that include:_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Security services, such as the fictional Google Security Framework_\n_Apps tied to specific locations (“Kashmir News”) or activities (“Falconry Connect” and_\n_“Mania Soccer”)_\n_Islam-related applications (“Quran Majeed”)._\n\n_The majority of applications appear to target Muslim individuals._\n\nLookout named Hornbill after the Indian Grey Hornbill, which is the state bird of Chandigarh\nand where the developers of Hornbill are located. SunBird’s name was derived from the\nmalicious services within the malware called “SunService” and the sunbird is also native to\nIndia.\n\n## Malicious functionality and impact of both SunBird and Hornbill\n\nHornbill and SunBird have both similarities and differences in the way they operate on an\ninfected device. While SunBird features remote access trojan (RAT) functionality – a malware\nthat can execute commands on an infected device as directed by an attacker – Hornbill is a\ndiscreet surveillance tool used to extract a selected set of data of interest to its operator.\n\nBoth of the malware can exfiltrate a wide range of data, such as:\n\nCall logs\nContacts\nDevice metadata including phone number, IMEI/Android ID, Model and Manufacturer\nand Android version\nGeolocation\nImages stored on external storage\nWhatsApp voice notes, if installed\n\nBoth malware are also able to perform the following actions on device:\n\nRequest device administrator privileges\nTake screenshots, capturing whatever a victim is currently viewing on their device\nTake photos with the device camera\nRecord environment and call audio\nScrape WhatsApp messages and contacts via accessibility services\nScrape WhatsApp notifications via accessibility services\n\n## SunBird-specific functionality\n\nSunBird has a more extensive set of malicious capabilities than Hornbill. It attempts to\nupload all data it has access to at regular intervals to its command and control (C2) servers.\nLocally on the infected device, the data is collected in SQLite databases which are then\ncompressed into ZIP files as they are uploaded to C2 infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nSunBird can exfiltrate the following list of data, in addition to the list above:\n\nList of installed applications\nBrowser history\nCalendar information\nBlackBerry Messenger (BBM) audio files, documents and images\nWhatsApp Audio files, documents, databases, voice notes and images\nContent sent and received via IMO instant messaging application\n\nIn addition to the list of actions above, SunBird can also perform the following actions:\n\nDownload attacker specified content from FTP shares\nRun arbitrary commands as root, if possible\nScrape BBM messages and contacts via accessibility services\nScrape BBM notifications via accessibility services\n\n_Samples of SunBird have been found hosted on third-party app stores, indicating one_\n_possible distribution mechanism. Considering many of these malware samples are trojanized_\n_– as in they contain complete user functionality – social engineering may also play a part in_\n_convincing targets to install the malware. No use of exploits was observed directly by_\n_Lookout researchers._\n\n## Hornbill-specific functionality\n\n\n-----\n\nIn contrast, Hornbill is more of a passive reconnaissance tool than SunBird. Not only does it\ntarget a limited set of data, the malware only uploads data when it initially runs and not at\nregular intervals like SunBird. After that, it only uploads changes in data to keep mobile data\nand battery usage low. The upload occurs when data monitored by Hornbill changes, such\nas when SMS, or WhatsApp notifications are received or calls are made from the device.\n\nHornbill is keenly interested in the state of an infected device and closely monitors the use of\nresources. For example, if the device is low on memory, it triggers the garbage collector. In\naddition to the list of exfiltrated data mentioned earlier, Hornbill also collects hardware\ninformation. For example, the malware can check if a device’s screen is locked, the amount\nof available internal and external storage and whether WiFi and GPS are enabled.\n\nHornbill only logs location information if it deems the changes to be significant enough from\nthe previously recorded location – if the difference between the corresponding latitudes and\nlongitudes differ by more than 0.0006 which is roughly 70 metres.\n\nData collected by Hornbill is stored in hidden folders on external storage. Once call\nrecordings or audio recordings are uploaded to C2 infrastructure they are deleted from the\ndevice to avoid suspicion.\n\n_List of hidden folders Hornbill creates and stores data to be exfiltrated to C2 infrastructure._\nHornbill uses a unique set of server paths to communicate to C2 infrastructure. These are\nlisted below along with what action Hornbill takes when sending HTTP POST requests to\neach.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe operators behind Hornbill are extremely interested in a user’s WhatsApp\ncommunications. In addition to exfiltrating message content and sender information of\nmessages, Hornbill records WhatsApp calls by detecting an active call by abusing Android’s\naccessibility services. The exploitation of Android’s accessibility services in this manner is a\ntrend we are observing frequently in Android surveillanceware. This enables the threat actor\nto avoid the need for privilege escalation on a device.\n\nLastly, Hornbill searches for and monitors activity on any documents stored on external\nstorage with the following suffixes: \".doc\", \".pdf\", \".ppt\", \".docx\", \".xlsx\", \".txt\". Whenever a\ndocument is created, opened, closed, modified, moved or deleted, this action is logged by\nHornbill. Functionality exists to modify this list of suffixes, but is incomplete in the samples we\nhave observed. The latest samples of Hornbill show that this malware threat may still be\nunder development.\n\n## Development timelines\n\nThe newest Hornbill sample was identified by Lookout’s app analysis engine as recently as\nDecember 2020, suggesting the malware may still be active today. Both ChatSpy and\nHornbill’s packaging dates appeared to have been tampered with, but we first observed them\nin January 2018 and May 2018 respectively.\n\nLookout first observed SunBird in January 2017, but unlike the other two malware families,\nthe packaging dates appear legitimate, indicating the malware was likely in development\nbetween December 2016 and early 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Hornbill, which Lookout first saw in May 2018, is actively deployed. We observed new_\n_samples as recently as December 2020. The first SunBird sample was seen as early as_\n_2017 and as late as December 2019._\n\n## Targeting\n\nTo better understand who SunBird may have been deployed against, we analyzed over\n18GB of exfiltrated data that was publicly exposed from at least six insecurely configured C2\nservers. All data uploaded to the C2 infrastructure included the locale of the infected devices.\nThis information, combined with the data content, gave us extensive insight into who was\nbeing targeted by this malware family and the kind of information the attackers were after.\n\nSome notable targets included an individual who applied for a position at the Pakistan\nAtomic Energy Commission, individuals with numerous contacts in the Pakistan Air Force\n(PAF), as well as officers responsible for electoral rolls (Booth Level Officers) located in the\nPulwama district of Kashmir.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Based on the locale and country code information of infected devices and exfiltrated content,_\n_we think SunBird may have roots as a commercial Android surveillanceware. The data_\n_included information on victims in Europe and the United States, some of which appear to be_\n_targets of spouseware or stalkerware. It also included data on Pakistani nationals in_\n_Pakistan, India and the United Arab Emirates that we believe may be targeted by Confucius_\n_APT campaigns between 2018 and 2019._\n\n## Malware development and commercial surveillance roots\n\nBoth Hornbill and SunBird appear to be evolved versions of commercial Android surveillance\ntooling. Hornbill seems to be derived from the same code base as a previously active\ncommercial surveillanceware product known as MobileSpy. 5 It is unclear how the\ndevelopers of Hornbill acquired the code, but the company behind MobileSpy, Retina-X\nStudios, shut down their surveillance software products in May 2018 after being hacked\ntwice. 6 Links between the Hornbill developers indicate they all appear to have worked\ntogether at a number of Android and iOS app development companies registered and\noperating in or near Chandigarh, Punjab, India. In 2017, one developer claimed to be\nworking at India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on their\nLinkedIn profile.\n\nSunBird looks to have been created by Indian developers who also produced another\ncommercial spyware product, which we dubbed BuzzOut. 7 The theory that SunBird’s roots\nlay in stalkerware was also supported by the content found in the exfiltrated data we\nuncovered. The data included information on stalkerware victims, as well as Pakistani\nnationals living in Pakistan and traveling in the UAE and India. This data suggests that\n\n\n-----\n\nSunBird could have been sold to an actor that selectively deployed it to gather intelligence on\n[targeted individuals. Similar behavior was observed with Stealth Mango and Tangelo, two](http://stealth-mango/?utm_source=BL&utm_medium=BL&utm_campaign=WW-MU-MU-MU-MU-P_NON-HornbillSunBird)\nnation state mobile surveillanceware Lookout researchers discovered in 2018. 8\n\n## Exfiltrated data\n\nDuring this investigation, we were able to access exfiltrated data for SunBird whose C2\ninfrastructure had been insufficiently secured.\n\n_This is a breakdown of types of data SunBird exfiltrated. This data is from publicly-accessible_\n_exfiltrated content exposed on SunBird C2 servers for 5 campaigns between 2018 and 2019._\n_We found another 12 GB of data exfiltrated on another C2 server 23.82.19[.]250. The default_\n_language of this server was set up as Chinese when discovered by Lookout researchers._\n_This may be a false flag or may have been altered by a third party. This also makes it difficult_\n_to confirm if all of the data originated from infections of actual target devices._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Frequency of infected devices’ locale and country code settings (translated to languages and_\n_countries) as packaged within publicly-accessible exfiltrated data. This data includes both the_\n_Confucius APT targets and spouseware victims of SunBird._\n\n**_Left:One particular SunBird C2 server was found to also be exposing a log file containing IP_**\n_addresses of those that logged into the administrator panel. The majority of these were_\n_distributed throughout India. Right: Geo-location data captured from a publicly-exposed_\n_database found on another Sunbird C2 IP 23.82.19[.]250. Almost all data stored on this_\n_server referenced phone numbers of various locations in northern India. The second most_\n_common region for phone numbers was Pakistan._\nWithin the exfiltrated data, one particular victim caught our interest. This individual was using\nWhatsApp to correspond with someone applying for a position at the Pakistan Nuclear\nRegulatory Authority in 2017. In 2018, messages were uncovered from someone applying for\na position at the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission.9\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditional exfiltrated data from late 2018 and early 2019 indicated that SunBird was being\nused to monitor Booth Level Officers10 responsible for field-level information regarding\nelectoral rolls in the Pulwama district of Kashmir. This time and location is significant as\nPulwama suffered a suicide bombing attack in February 2019, which increased tensions\nbetween India and Pakistan. The start date of active monitoring of this target on C2 servers\ncoincided with the start of the Indian general elections held in April 2019.\n\n_Continuous data exfiltration data that occurred every ten minutes stopped at the end of 2018._\n_Aside from one brief upload in January 2019, it suddenly picked up again on the 11th of April_\n_2019. While this may be coincidence, this is also the same day that the Indian general_\n_elections of 2019 began.12_\n\nA total of 156 victims were discovered in this new dataset and included phone numbers from\nIndia, Pakistan and Kazakhstan.\n\n## Confucius connection\n\n_Hornbill application icons impersonate various chat and system applications._\nSimilar to previous Confucius tactics seen with ChatSpy, Hornbill samples often impersonate\nchat applications such as Fruit Chat, Cucu Chat and Kako Chat. The related C2\ninfrastructure communicates on port 8080, a pattern also seen on the desktop campaigns\ncarried out by Confucius.14\n\nThe Confucius group is well known for impersonating legitimate services to cover their tracks\nand confuse its victims. Naming malicious apps similar to legitimate ones may be an attempt\nto gain a target’s trust. For example, “kako chat” may have been named due to its similarity\nto KakaoTalk.15 However, Kako Chat’s C2 server (chatk.goldenbirdcoin[.]com) references a\ndefunct cryptocurrency by the same name.16 Cucu Chat may refer to a seemingly benign\ndating app of the same name that is available on third-party app stores such as APKPure.17,\n18 However, Cucu Chat communicates to the site http://wangu[.]xyz19 (also on port 8080)\n\n\n-----\n\nand itself appears to be an impersonation of Wangu, an application which advertises itself as\na chat app for Zimbabweans.20 The latest sample of Hornbill titled “Filos” trojanizes the\nMesibo21 Android application for legitimate chat functionality.\n\nDuring our investigation, we noticed that Hornbill C2 infrastructure hosted HTML resources\nconsistent with a commercial spyware page, but missing its image resources.\n\n_C2 servers for Hornbill were found to host HTML content from a commercial spyware._\nAdditionally, Hornbill carries out data exfiltration via the following unique set of\nserver paths:\n\nWe found that the patterns noted above also existed on another domain samaatv[.]online.\nAlthough Lookout has not directly observed an APK communicating to this domain, we think\none likely exists. samaatv[.]online has resolved to the IP address 91.210.107[.]104 since\nMay 2019, which encompasses the activity of this campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to this, we found the SunBird C2 domain pieupdate[.]online resolved to\n91.210.107.111 in between February 2019 and July 2019. This is also the timeframe in which\nwe observed active campaigns by SunBird on that infrastructure.\n\nWith the help of public reporting and Lookout’s dataset, we are confident that the Confucius\nAPT group is actively using the IPs between 91.210.107[.]103-91.210.107[.]112 to host a\nlarge portion of their infrastructure, both presently and in the past.\n\nAdditional open-source intelligence (OSINT) searches confirmed the above connections. We\nfound a publicly-accessible 2018 Pakistani government advisory warning of a desktop\nmalware campaign targeting officers and government staff. The campaign described in it\nused phishing emails that impersonated various government agencies to deliver malicious\nMicrosoft Word exploits. The Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for this campaign included\ndomains that were known Confucius infrastructure, leading us to believe the entire campaign\ncould be attributed to that group.\n\n_Official Report from Pakistan’s Federal Bureau of Revenue on Malicious Activity._\nA particular point of interest on the advisory IoC list, and crucial in confirming Confucius\nconnections, was pieupdate[.]online, a C2 server for malicious desktop activity as well as\nSunBird mobile malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Hornbill malware has unique file paths with which to communicate with C2 servers. They_\n_also display a unique Spyware HTML page. Lookout researchers uncovered another domain,_\n_samaatv[.]online, which shares the same unique file paths and Spyware HTML page found_\n_on a Hornbill C2 server, cucuchat[.]com. It is tied to known Confucius infrastructure by_\n_resolving to 91.210.107[.]104, in the Confucius IP range._\nWe are confident SunBird and Hornbill are two tools used by the same actor, perhaps for\ndifferent surveillance purposes.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge the apps described in this article were never distributed through\nGoogle Play. Users of Lookout security apps are protected from these threats.\n\nLookout Threat Advisory Services customers have already been notified with additional\n[intelligence on this and other threats.
