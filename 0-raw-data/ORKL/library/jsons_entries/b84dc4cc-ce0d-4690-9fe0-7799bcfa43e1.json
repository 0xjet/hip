The site appears to have been designed to target\nusers in Hong Kong based on the content of the landing page. Since the initial activity, we\nreleased two private reports exhaustively detailing spread, exploits, infrastructure and LightSpy\nimplants.\n\n_Landing page of watering hole site_\n\nWe are temporarily calling this APT group “TwoSail Junk”. Currently, we have hints from known\nbackdoor callbacks to infrastructure about clustering this campaign with previous activity. And we\nare working with colleagues to tie LightSpy with prior activity from a long running Chinese\n\n-----\n\n[speaking APT group, previously reported on as Spring Dragon/Lotus Blossom/Billbug(Thrip),](https://securelist.com/the-spring-dragon-apt/70726/)\nknown for their Lotus Elise and Evora backdoor malware. Considering this LightSpy activity has\n[been disclosed publicly by our colleagues from TrendMicro, we would like to further contribute](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/Tech-Brief-Operation-Poisoned-News-Hong-Kong-Users-Targeted-with-Mobile-Malware-via-Local-News-Links.pdf)\nmissing information to the story without duplicating content. And, in our quest to secure\ntechnologies for a better future, we reported the malware and activity to Apple and other relevant\ncompanies.\n\nThis supplemental information can be difficult to organize to make for easy reading. In light of this,\nthis document is broken down into several sections.\n\n1. Deployment timeline – additional information clarifying LightSpy deployment milestone\n\nevents, including both exploit releases and individual LightSpy iOS implant component\nupdates.\n2. Spreading – supplemental technical details on various techniques used to deliver malicious\n\nlinks to targets\n3. Infrastructure – supplemental description of a TwoSail Junk RDP server, the LightSpy\n\nadmin panel, and some related server-side javascript\n4. Android implant and a pivot into evora – additional information on an Android implant and\n\nrelated infrastructure. After pivoting from the infrastructure in the previous section, we find\nrelated implants and backdoor malware, helping to connect this activity to previously known\nSpringDragon APT with low confidence.\n\nMore information about LightSpy is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting.\n[Contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## Deployment timeline\n\nDuring our investigation, we observed the actor modifying some components involved in the\nexploit chain on February 7, 2020 with major changes, and on March 5, 2020 with minor ones.\n\n_Figure 1 Brief LightSpy event timeline_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first observed version of the WebKit exploit dated January 10, 2020 closely resembled a\nproof of concept (PoC), containing elements such as buttons, alert messages, and many log\nstatements throughout. The second version commented out or removed many of the log\nstatements, changed alert() to print() statements, and also introduced some language errors such\nas “your device is not support…” and “stab not find…”.\n\nBy analyzing the changes in the first stage WebKit exploit, we discovered the list of supported\ndevices was also significantly extended:\n_Table 1. iOS version exploit support expansion_\n\n#### Device iOS version Supported as of Jan 10 Supported as of Feb 7\n\n iPhone 6 11.03 + –\n\n iPhone 6S 12.01 + commented\n\n 12.2 – +\n\n iPhone 7 12.1 – +\n\n 12.11 + +\n\n 12.12 + +\n\n 12.14 – +\n\n 12.2 – +\n\n iPhone 7+ 12.2 – +\n\n iPhone 8 12.2 – +\n\n iPhone 8+ 12.2 – +\n\n iPhone X 12.2 – +\n\nAs seen above, the actor was actively changing implant components, which is why we are\nproviding a full list of historical hashes in the IoC section at the end of this report. There were\nmany minor changes that did not directly affect the functionality of each component, but there\nwere also some exceptions to this that will be expanded on below. Based on our observations of\nthese changes over a relatively short time frame, we can assess that the actor implemented a\nfairly agile development process, with time seemingly more important than stealthiness or quality.\n\nOne interesting observation involved the “EnvironmentalRecording” plugin (MD5:\nae439a31b8c5487840f9ad530c5db391), which was a dynamically linked shared library\nresponsible for recording surrounding audio and phone calls. On February 7, 2020, we noticed a\nnew binary (MD5: f70d6b3b44d855c2fb7c662c5334d1d5) with the same name with no similarities\nto the earlier one. This new file did not contain any environment paths, version stamps, or any\nother traces from the parent plugin pattern. Its sole purpose was to clean up the implant\n\n\n-----\n\ncomponents by erasing all files located in “/var/iolight/”, “/bin/light/”, and “/bin/irc_loader/”. We’re\ncurrently unsure whether the actor intended to replace the original plugin with an uninstall\npackage or if this was a result of carelessness or confusion from the rapid development process.\n\nAnother example of a possible mistake involved the “Screenaaa” plugin. The first version (MD5:\n35fd8a6eac382bfc95071d56d4086945) that was deployed on January 10, 2020 did what we\nexpected: It was a small plugin designed to capture a screenshot, create a directory, and save the\ncapture file in JPEG format. However, the plugin (MD5: 7b69a20920d3b0e6f0bffeefdce7aa6c)\nwith the same name that was packaged on February 7 had a completely different functionality.\n[This binary was actually a LAN scanner based on MMLanScan, an open source project for iOS](https://github.com/mavris/MMLanScan)\nthat helps scan a network to show available devices along with their MAC addresses, hostname,\nand manufacturer. Most likely, this plugin was mistakenly bundled up in the February 7 payload\nwith the same name as the screenshot plugin.\n\n_Figure 2. LightSpy iOS implant component layout and communications_\n\n## Spreading\n\nWe cannot say definitively that we have visibility into all of their spreading mechanisms. We do\nknow that in past campaigns, precise targeting of individuals was performed over various social\nnetwork platforms with direct messaging. And, both ours and previous reporting from others have\ndocumented TwoSail Junk’s less precise and broad use of forum posts and replies. These forum\nposts direct individuals frequenting these sites to pages hosting iframes served from their exploit\nservers. We add Telegram channels and instagram posts to the list of communication channels\nabused by these attackers.\n\nThese sites and communication medium are known to be frequented by some activist groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. LightSpy iPhone infection steps_\n\nThe initial watering hole site (hxxps://appledaily.googlephoto[.]vip/news[.]html) on January 10,\n2020 was designed to mimic a well known Hong Kong based newspaper “Apple Daily” by copypasting HTML content from the original:\n\n_Figure 4. Source of html page mimicking newspaper “Apple Daily”_\n\nHowever, at that time, we had not observed any indications of the site being purposely distributed\nin the wild. Based on our KSN detection statistics, we began seeing a massive distribution\ncampaign beginning on February 18, 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 2. LightSpy related iframe domains, urls, and first seen_\n\n_timestamps_\n\nStarting on February 18, the actors began utilizing a series of invisible iframes to redirect potential\nvictims to the exploit site as well as the intended legitimate news site from the lure.\n\n_Figure 5. Source of html page with lure and exploit_\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n### RDP Clues\n\n\n-----\n\nThe domain used for the initial watering hole page (googlephoto[.]vip) was registered through\nGoDaddy on September 24, 2019. No unmasked registration information was able to be obtained\nfor this domain. The subdomain (appledaily.googlephoto[.]vip) began resolving to a non-parked IP\naddress (103.19.9[.]185) on January 10, 2020 and has not moved since. The server is located in\nSingapore and is hosted by Beyotta Network, LLP.\n\nAt the time of our initial investigation, the server was listening on ports 80 (HTTP) and 3389 (RDP\nwith SSL/TLS enabled). The certificate for the server was self-signed and created on December\n16, 2019. Based on Shodan data as early as December 21, 2019, there was a currently logged in\nuser detected who’s name was “SeinandColt”.\n\n_Figure 6. Screenshot of RDP login page for the server 103.19.9[.]185_\n\n### Admin Panel\n\nThe C2 server for the iOS payload (45.134.1[.]180) also appeared to have an admin panel on\nTCP port 50001.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe admin panel seems to be a Vue.js application bundled with Webpack. It contains two\nlanguage packs: English and Chinese. A cursory analysis provides us the impression of actual\nscale of the framework:\n\nIf we take a closer look at the index.js file for the panel, some interesting configurations are\nvisible, to include a user config, an application list, log list, and other interesting settings.\n\nThe “userConfig” variable indicates other possible platforms that may have been targeted by the\nsame actors, such as linux, windows, and routers.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother interesting setting includes the “app_list” variable which is commented out. This lists two\ncommon applications used for streaming and chat mostly in China (QQ and Miapoi). Looking\nfurther, we can also see that the default map coordinates in the config point directly to the\nTian’anmen Gate in Beijing, however, most likely this is just a common and symbolic mapping\napplication default for the center of Beijing.\n\n## Android implants and a pivot into “evora”\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring analysis of the infrastructure related to iOS implant distribution we also found a link\ndirecting to Android malware – hxxp://app.hkrevolution[.]club/HKcalander[.]apk (MD5:\n77ebb4207835c4f5c4d5dfe8ac4c764d).\n\nAccording to artefacts found in google cache, this link was distributed through Telegram channels\n“winuxhk” and “brothersisterfacebookclub”, and Instagram posts in late November 2019 with a\nmessage lure in Chinese translated as “The Hong Kong People Calendar APP is online ~~~\nFollow the latest Hong Kong Democracy and Freedom Movement. Click to download and support\nthe frontline. Currently only Android version is available.”\n\nFurther technical analysis of the packed APK reveals the timestamp of its actual build – 2019-1104 18:12:33. Also it uses the subdomain, sharing an iOS implant distribution domain, as its c2\nserver – hxxp://svr.hkrevolution[.]club:8002.\n\nIts code contains a link to another related domain:\n\nChecking this server we found it hosted another related APK:\n\n#### MD5 fadff5b601f6fca588007660934129eb\n\n URL hxxp://movie.poorgoddaay[.]com/MovieCal[.]apk\n\n C2 hxxp://app.poorgoddaay[.]com:8002\n\n Build timestamp 2019-07-25 21:57:47\n\nThe distribution vector remains the same – Telegram channels:\n\nThe latest observed APK sample is hosted on a server that is unusual for the campaign context –\nxxinc-media[.]oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs[.]com. We assume that the actors are taking steps to\nsplit the iOS and Android activities between different infrastructure pieces.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### MD5 5d2b65790b305c186ef7590e5a1f2d6b\n\n URL hxxps://xxinc-media.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs[.]com/calendar-re‐ lease-1.0.1.apk\n\n C2 hxxp://45.134.0[.]123:8002\n\n\n#### Build timestamp\n\n\n#### 2020-01-14 18:30:30\n\n\nWe had not observed any indications of this URL being distributed in the wild yet.\n\nIf we take a look closer at the domain poorgoddaay[.]com that not only hosted the malicious APK\nbut also was a C2 for them, we can note that there are two subzones of particular interest to us:\n\nzg.poorgoddaay[.]com\nns1.poorgoddaay[.]com\n\nWe were able to work with partners to pivot into a handful of “evora” samples that use the above\ntwo subzones as their C2. Taking that a step further, using our Kaspersky Threat Attribution\nEngine (KTAE), we can see that the partner samples using those subzones are 99% similar to\nprevious backdoors deployed by SpringDragon.\n\nWe are aware of other related and recent “evora” malware samples calling back to these same\nsubnets while targeting organizations in Hong Kong as well. These additional factors help lend at\nleast low confidence to clustering this activity with SpringDragon/LotusBlossom/Billbug.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis particular framework and infrastructure is an interesting example of an agile approach to\ndeveloping and deploying surveillance framework in Southeast Asia. This innovative approach is\nsomething we have seen before from SpringDragon, and LightSpy targeting geolocation at least\nfalls within previous regional targeting of SpringDragon/LotusBlossom/Billbug APT, as does\ninfrastructure and “evora” backdoor use.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Source: wikimedia.org](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:KITLV_-_65860_-_Chinese_junks_at_Macau_-_presumably_1900-1902.tiff)_\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n### File hashes\n\n**payload.dylib**\n9b248d91d2e1d1b9cd45eb28d8adff71 (Jan 10, 2020)\n4fe3ca4a2526088721c5bdf96ae636f4 (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n**ircbin.plist**\ne48c1c6fb1aa6c3ff6720e336c62b278 (Jan 10, 2020)\n\n**irc_loader**\n53acd56ca69a04e13e32f7787a021bb5 (Jan 10, 2020)\n\n**light**\n184fbbdb8111d76d3b1377b2768599c9 (Jan 10, 2020)\nbfa6bc2cf28065cfea711154a3204483 (Feb 7, 2020)\nff0f66b7089e06702ffaae6025b227f0 (Mar 5, 2020)\n\n**baseinfoaaa.dylib**\na981a42fb740d05346d1b32ce3d2fd53 (Jan 10, 2020)\n5c69082bd522f91955a6274ba0cf10b2 (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n\n-----\n\n**browser**\n7b263f1649dd56994a3da03799611950 (Jan 10, 2020)\n\n**EnvironmentalRecording**\nae439a31b8c5487840f9ad530c5db391 (Jan 10, 2020)\nf70d6b3b44d855c2fb7c662c5334d1d5 (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n**FileManage**\nf1c899e7dd1f721265cc3e3b172c7e90 (Jan 10, 2020)\nea9295d8409ea0f1d894d99fe302070e (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n**ios_qq**\nc450e53a122c899ba451838ee5250ea5 (Jan 10, 2020)\nf761560ace765913695ffc04dfb36ca7 (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n**ios_telegram**\n1e12e9756b344293352c112ba84533ea (Jan 10, 2020)\n5e295307e4429353e78e70c9a0529d7d (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n**ios_wechat**\n187a4c343ff4eebd8a3382317cfe5a95 (Jan 10, 2020)\n66d2379318ce8f74cfbd0fb26afc2084 (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n**KeyChain**\ndb202531c6439012c681328c3f8df60c (Jan 10, 2020)\n\n**locationaaa.dylib**\n3e7094eec0e99b17c5c531d16450cfda (Jan 10, 2020)\n06ff47c8108f7557bb8f195d7b910882 (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n**Screenaaa**\n35fd8a6eac382bfc95071d56d4086945 (Jan 10, 2020)\n7b69a20920d3b0e6f0bffeefdce7aa6c (Feb 7, 2020)\n\n**ShellCommandaaa**\na8b0c99f20a303ee410e460730959d4e (Jan 10, 2020)\n\n**SoftInfoaaa**\n8cdf29e9c6cca6bf8f02690d8c733c7b (Jan 10, 2020)\n\n**WifiList**\nc400d41dd1d3aaca651734d4d565997c (Jan 10, 2020)\n\n**Android malware**\n77ebb4207835c4f5c4d5dfe8ac4c764d\nfadff5b601f6fca588007660934129eb\n5d2b65790b305c186ef7590e5a1f2d6b\n\n\n-----\n\n**Past similar SpringDragon evora**\n1126f8af2249406820c78626a64d12bb\n33782e5ba9067b38d42f7ecb8f2acdc8\n\n### Domains and IPs\n\n**Implant c2**\n45.134.1[.]180 (iOS)\n45.134.0[.]123 (Android)\napp.poorgoddaay[.]com (Android)\nsvr[.]hkrevolution[.]club (Android)\n\n**WebKit exploit landing**\n45.83.237[.]13\nmessager[.]cloud\n\n**Spreading**\nappledaily.googlephoto[.]vip\nwww[.]googlephoto[.]vip\nnews2.hkrevolution[.]club\nnews.hkrevolution[.]club\nwww[.]facebooktoday[.]cc\nwww[.]hkrevolt[.]com\nnews.hkrevolt[.]com\nmovie.poorgoddaay[.]com\nxxinc-media[.]oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs[.]com\n\n**Related subdomains**\napp.hkrevolution[.]club\nnews.poorgoddaay[.]com\nzg.poorgoddaay[.]com\nns1.poorgoddaay[.]com\n\n### Full Mobile Device Command List\n\nchange_config\nexe_cmd\nstop_cmd\nget_phoneinfo\nget_contacts\nget_call_history\nget_sms\ndelete_sms\nsend_sms\nget_wechat_account\nget_wechat_contacts\nget_wechat_group\nget wechat msg\n\n\n-----\n\nget_wechat_file\nget_location\nget_location_coninuing\nget_browser_history\nget_dir\nupload_file\ndownload_file\ndelete_file\nget_picture\nget_video\nget_audio\ncreate_dir\nrename_file\nmove_file\ncopy_file\nget_app\nget_process\nget_wifi_history\nget_wifi_nearby\ncall_record\ncall_photo\nget_qq_account\nget_qq_contacts\nget_qq_group\nget_qq_msg\nget_qq_file\nget_keychain\nscreenshot\n\n\n-----",
