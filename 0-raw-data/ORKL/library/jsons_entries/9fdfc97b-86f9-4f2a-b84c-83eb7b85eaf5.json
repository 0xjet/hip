As of this publication,\nauthorities have linked the botnet to an estimated £20 million (approximately $30.5 million) in\nlosses in the UK, and at least $10 million in losses in the United States. Dridex was created\nfrom the source code of the Bugat banking trojan (also known as Cridex) but is distinct from\nprevious Bugat variants, particularly with respect to its modular architecture and its use of a\nhybrid peer-to-peer (P2P) network to mask its backend infrastructure and complicate\ntakedown attempts.\n\n## Malware distribution\n\nDridex is distributed through spam emails using various lures. In the past, some of the spam\nemail attachments exploited vulnerabilities, but recent samples analyzed by CTU\nresearchers used Microsoft Word macros (see Figure 1). After the victim opens the Word\n\n\n-----\n\ndocument, the macro attempts to download and execute the Dridex loader, which installs the\nother botnet components.\n\n_Figure 1. Spam email distributing the Dridex trojan. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\n## Malware architecture\n\nThe Dridex malware has four primary components:\n\nLoader — downloads the core module and an initial node list to join the P2P network\nCore module — performs the malware's core functions (harvesting credentials,\nperforming man-in-the-browser attacks using web injects, downloading the VNC and\nbackconnect modules, etc.)\nVNC module — allows the attacker to remotely view and control a victim's computer\nBackconnect module — allows the attacker to tunnel network traffic through a victim's\ncomputer\n\nFigure 2 shows the relationship between these modular components.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Architecture of the Dridex trojan. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\n### Affiliate model\n\nSimilar to the P2P Gameover Zeus and Gozi Neverquest botnets, Dridex operates with an\naffiliate model. The botnet is partitioned into sub-botnets, and each affiliate has access to its\nown subset of bots. The Dridex command and control (C2) servers multiplex bot requests\naccording to a botnet value contained in each request. CTU researchers have observed the\nfollowing Dridex sub-botnets: 120, 121, 122, 125, 126, 127, 200, 220, 300, 305, 310, 320,\nand 888.\n\n**Botnet architecture**\n\nEarly versions of Dridex (builds 0x10000 - 0x1009F) used a centralized architecture for C2\ncommunications (see Figure 3). Like its predecessor Bugat, Dridex's compromised servers\nacted as proxies to the backend servers. Each Bugat/Dridex malware sample included a set\nof hard-coded C2 servers that the threat actors had compromised. This architecture provided\na modest amount of resiliency to mitigation efforts from law enforcement and security\nresearchers. However, this centralized architecture does not scale well and does not provide\nthe same level of redundancy as a P2P network.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Botnet architecture of Bugat and early versions of Dridex. (Source: Dell_\n_SecureWorks)_\n\n## Peer-to-peer communication\n\nIn November 2014, the Dridex developers for build versions greater than 0x20000 introduced\na P2P network that leverages existing bots to relay traffic between bots, compromised\nservers, and the criminal infrastructure. Dridex bots that have a public IP address and are not\nbehind a NAT or firewall can act as a node in a P2P network, as shown in Figure 4.\n\n_Figure 4. Revised botnet architecture for Dridex. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nThe Dridex P2P network is a hybrid between a centralized and a decentralized network. Peer\nlists and configuration files are distributed by the backend servers (i.e., distributed centrally)\nrather than exchanged directly between peers. Binary updates and modules are exchanged\nautonomously between peers in the network (i.e., distributed decentrally), which reduces\n\n\n-----\n\nsome of the load on the backend. This hybrid P2P architecture significantly limits the botnet s\nability to self-organize and maintain itself without outside intervention, unlike other P2P\nbotnets such as Kelihos and Gameover Zeus.\n\n## Web injects\n\nThe CTU research team has tracked Dridex's activities since July 2014 and has captured\n359 unique configuration files, with 414 active inject targets, as of this publication. The web\ninjects used by Dridex vary depending on the sub-botnet, some of which are region-specific.\nAs shown in Table 1, the Dridex botnet's web injects have targeted 27 different countries\nworldwide.\n\n**Region** **Countries**\n\n\nNorth\nAmerica\n\n\nUnited States, Canada\n\n\nEurope United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Switzerland, Germany, Norway, Austria,\nNetherlands, Italy, Belgium, Croatia, Bulgaria, and Romania\n\n\nMiddle\nEast\n\n\nUnited Arab Emirates, Qatar, Israel\n\n\nAsia Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, China, India, and Vietnam\n\n\nSouth\nPacific\n\n\nAustralia, New Zealand\n\n\n_Table 1. Regions and countries targeted by Dridex's web injects._\n\n## Dridex botnet takeover\n\nIn collaboration with the NCA, the FBI, and the Shadowserver Foundation, CTU researchers\ndeveloped and executed a technical strategy to take over the Dridex botnet by poisoning\neach sub-botnet's P2P network and redirecting infected systems to a sinkhole. Figure 5\nshows the malware infections observed at the sinkhole for Dridex's sub-botnet 220, which\ncontained approximately 4,000 active bots. This sub-botnet heavily targeted Western\nEurope, especially the United Kingdom and France.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Map of Dridex infections for sub-botnet 220. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThreat actors created botnets such as Dridex to fill the void left by the takedown of the\nGameover Zeus botnet in May 2014 as part of Operation Tovar. Despite a significant overlap\nin tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), Dridex never rivaled the sophistication, size,\nand success of Gameover Zeus. This operation took advantage of weaknesses in Dridex's\nhybrid P2P architecture to take over the botnet.\n\n## Additional Information\n\nNational Crime Agency.
