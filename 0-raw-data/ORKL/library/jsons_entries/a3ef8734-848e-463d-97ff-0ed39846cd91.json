(USA), a Los Angeles-based cybersecurity company protecting Fortune\n500's worldwide, has detected an update to one of them most popular tools used by\ncybercriminals. The tool in question generates malicious LNK files, and is so frequently\nused for malicious payload deliveries these days.\n\nMLNK Builder has emerged in Dark Web with their new version (4.2), and the updated\nfeature-set focuses on AV evasion and masquerading with icons from legitimately popular\napplications and file formats.\n\nThe noteable spike of campaigns involving malicious shortcuts (LNK files) conducted by\nboth APT groups and advanced cybercriminals was detected in April-May this year –\nBumblebee Loader and UAC-0010 (Armageddon) targeting EU Countries described by\nCERT UA.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious shortcuts continue to give hard times to network defenders, especially\nwhen combating global botnet and ransomware activity, using them as a channel for multistaged payload deliveries.\n\nAccording to experts from Resecurity, the existing MLNK Builder customers will receive an\nupdate for free, but the authors have also released a “Private Edition” which is only\navailable to a tight circle of vetted customers, it requires an additional license costing $125\nper build.\n\nThe updated tool provides a rich arsenal of options and settings to generate malicious files\nto appear as legitimate Microsoft Word, Adobe PDF, ZIP Archives, images .JPG/.PNG,\naudio MP3 and even video .AVI files. as well as more advanced features to obfuscate\nmalicious payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nBad actors continue to develop creative ways to trick detection mechanisms enabeling\nthem the successful delivery of their malicious payloads – by leveraging combinations of\nextensions and different file formats, as well as Living Off the Land Binaries (LOLbins).\n\nThe most actively used malware families leveraging LNK-based distribution are TA570\nOakboat (aka Qbot), IcedID, AsyncRAT and the new strain of Emotet. The most recent\nQakbot distribution campaign also included malicious Word documents using the CVE2022-30190 (Follina) zero-day vulnerability in the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool\n(MSDT).\n\nSome notable campaigns have been detected in April-May 2022. The cybercriminal\nactivity utilized related APT attacks targeting private and public sectors:\n\n- UAC-0010 (Armageddon) Activity targeting EU Countries\n\n[https://cert.gov.ua/article/39086](https://cert.gov.ua/article/39086)\n\nThe bad actors are using malicious LNK files in a combination with ISO (via extension\nspoofing) to confuse the antivirus logic and endpoint protection solutions. It’s interesting to\nnote how well-known products in the industry are not able to properly detect and analyze\nthem.\n\n## What is the LNK file?\n\n\n-----\n\nShell Link Binary File Format, which contains information that can be used to access\nanother data object. The Shell Link Binary File Format is the format of Windows files with\nthe extension \".LNK\".\n\nLNK is a filename extension for shortcuts to local files in Windows. LNK file shortcuts\nprovide quick access to executable files (.exe) without the users navigating the program's\nfull path.\n\nFiles with the Shell Link Binary File Format (.LNK) contain metadata about the executable\nfile, including the original path to the target application.\n\nWindows uses this data to support the launching of applications, linking of scenarios, and\nstoring application references to a target file.\n\nWe all use .LNK files as shortcuts in our Desktop, Control Panel, Task Menu, and Windows\nExplorer\n\n## Why attackers use LNK file\n\nSuch files typically look legitimate, and may have an icon the same as an existing\napplication or document. The bad actors incorporate malicious code into LNK files (e.g.\nPowershell scenario) allowing the execution of the payload on the target machine.\n\nThe process of a malicious .LNK\n\nLet’s review a sample of a malicious LNK file in more detail:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malicious .LNK file\n\nIn this example, PowerShell code was embedded inside the file which will be executed\nafter the victim clicks on the LNK file. We have examined the structure of the file using\nMalcat:\n\nPowerShell code embedded inside the file\n\nYou can see the PowerShell scenario embedded in the file:\n\nPowerShell scenario embedded\n\nThe logic of the scenario allows to bypass the execution policy and download the file from\nexternal resource and execute it:\n\n\n-----\n\nBypassing the execution policy\n\nWe observed a campaign that delivered Bumblebee through contact forms on a target’s\nwebsite. The messages claimed that the website used stolen images and included a link\nthat ultimately delivered an ISO file containing the malware.\n\nResecurity attributed this campaign to another threat actor the company tracks as TA578\nand has done since May 2020. TA578 uses email campaigns to deliver malware like\nUrsnif, IcedID, KPOT Stealer, Buer Loader, and BazaLoader, as well as Cobalt Strike.\n\nOur researchers detected another campaign in April that hijacked email threads to deliver\nthe Bumblebee malware loader in replies to the target with an archived ISO attachment.\n\nLNK file executes DLL malware file\n\nSo, we can extract the hidden file with pass, we can see that in the next figure.\n\nExtracting the hidden file with pass\n\nAfter that we can examine the .ISO contents which includes a document file (.LNK file) and\nnamr.dll file, we can then further analyze the .LNK file, shown in the next figure.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalyzing the malicious .LNK file\n\nFrom the previous figure, we identify how the .LNK file contains a command to execute the\n.DLL file.\n\n## How Attackers Generate Malicious LNK Files?\n\nAttackers can generate malicious shortcuts via tools available for sale in the Dark Web.\nOne such tool is advertised in a Telegram channel “Native-One.xyz | Products & Software |\nExploit \" called mLNK builder – it grants the ability to convert any payload into a .LNK file\nformat.\n\nGeneration of malicious shortcut files\n\nCybercriminals can purchase mLNK builder by using one of the three available plans,\nstarting from a one month to 3 month plan and then a private option (providing unique\nstub).\n\n\n-----\n\nPurchasing the mLNK builder\n\nThe price of the tool starts from $100 (per month) with the option to evade Windows\nDefender, Smart Screen and UAC:\n\nmLNK tool evades Windows Defender, Smart\n\nScreen & UAC\n\nThe features of the mLNK builder include bypassing the following solutions:\n\n1. Windows Defender\n2. Windows Defender Memory\n3. Windows Defender Cloud Scanner\n4. Smart Screen Alert\n5. AMSI and MUCH MORE!\n\nThe features of mLNK\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter buying the tool, the author of the tool will send you text file containing the credential\nto login.\n\nThe text file containing credentials to login\n\nAfter we opened the link we found this page, we must enter the credentials which were\nsent by the author, after registering the tool will downloaded.\n\nToken registration\n\nRecently they published a new version of the tool, it will be free to all the old users, it now\nalso contains new ICONs like Documents and PDF as we will see in this report.\n\n- [https://t.me/NativeOne_Products/24224](https://t.me/NativeOne_Products/24224)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## The analysis of the tool\n\nHere we can see the analysis of the tool, we can see there are two functions.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalyzing the malicious tool\n\nWhen examining the sub_401350, we can see how the tool use ShellExcuteA to execute\nthe PowerShell code. This PowerShell communicates with C&C, we can see that in the\nnext figure.\n\nPowerShell communicates with C&C\n\nAfter downloading the binary from C&C, we can decode the payload by using the base64\ndecoder, then use ASE decryption to decrypt the payload, we can then see the process\nthe tool follows to decrypt the payload,\n\n1. Downloading the payload from “https://native-one[.]com:4200/client_auth”\n2. Gets 'BHDAU532BKPXTGB89G3JK6KKDSZDY8SM' converts to bytes and\n\ncomputes sha1 and convert to hex string returns first 32chars of hexstring(aeskey)\n_== fc002b88fa5ccd51bfabd8c753e8aa3d_\n3. coverts downloaded payload each hex XX to an array of decimal values and get the\n\nfirst 16 and uses it as IV for AES\n4. Decryption AES CBC 256 key == fc002b88fa5ccd51bfabd8c753e8aa3d (32bytes\n\neach char 1 byte) IV == 9042766da089753480c479e2b342862f -fromhex(16bytes).\n\nUsing ASE decryption on the payload\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter decrypting the payload, we got a second PowerShell code that s used to validate the\ncredentials, we can see that in the next figure.\n\nDecrypting the payload reveals second\n\nPowerShell code\n\nAfter executing the tool, the email and password used to register is required once again,\nwe can see this in the next figure.\n\nAfter executing the tool\n\nWe register with the email and password, then we get the GUI for the tool enabling us to\nstart converting payloads into .LNK files, we can see that in the next figure.\n\n\n-----\n\nGUI after logging in\n\nWe can see the folder setup the tool uses which has a Decoders payloads, also we can\nsee the shortcuts for the converted payloads, we can see that in the next figure.\n\nWe can now see the folder tree\n\nWe create four payloads to test detection, after creating the payloads, we start importing\nthem one by one to create shortcuts for them. We test detection by using windows\ndefender and others, we can see importing file into the next figure.\n\n\n-----\n\nCreating four payloads to test detection\n\nAfter that we can build the decoder and we can see that in the next figure.\n\nBuilding the decoder\n\nAfter decoding the payload, it will save in the Decoders folders, we can see that in the next\nfigure.\n\n\n-----\n\nSaved in decoders folder\n\nAnd after that we can import the URL of decoded payload and create the .LNK, we can\nsee that in the next figure.\n\nCreating four payloads to test detection\n\nNow, we can build the .LNK file, we can see that in the next figure\n\n\n-----\n\nBuilding the malicious .LNK (shortcut) file\n\nFinally, we can see the .LNK file in the shortcut folder, we can see that in the next figure.\n\nAfter the creation of the file, we can see the\n\nlocation\n\nSo, now we can examine the target file and see how the .LNK file was created, we can see\nthat in the next figure.\n\n\n-----\n\nExamining the target file to see how it was\n\ncreated\n\nFrom the previous figure, we can see how the target contains PowerShell code. Now, we\nwant to test the detection of the payload.\n\nThe attackers recently generated a new .LNK file with the PowerShell ICON, this is not\ncommon, the .LNK technique nowadays is widely used as we can see in the below\nscreenshot, this is a PowerShell .LNK containing a new stage of the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nAs observed, the newest version of mLNK Builder demonstrated very low detection rates\nby popular antivirus products which increases the effectiveness of the malicious .LNK files\nin cyber-attacks.\n\nRecently we found qabot was using the LNK technique.\n\nobama187 - .html > .zip > .img > .lnk > .dll\n\nas we can see there are two files the LNK file will run the dll file\n\nHere we can see the LNK command\n\n“rundll32.exe scanned.dll,DllUnregisterServer”\n\n\n-----\n\nAlso, we observed how Bumblebee used the LNK technique\n\nvia OneDrive URLs -> IMG -> LNK -> BAT -> DLL recently\n\nAfter we extracted the ISO we found these files, the shortcut was conations, code to run\nthe batch file.\n\nAs we can see the shortcut contains the code to run the batch file in the screenshot below.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe batch conations this code to run the DLL library.\n\nAlso, recently we caught emotet using the technique to run VBS code via the LNK file, as\nwe can see in the below screenshot the LNK file contains the malicious code:\n\n“C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /v:on /c findstr \"glKmfOKnQLYKnNs.*\" \"Datos-2504.lnk\" >\n\"%tmp%\\YlScZcZKeP.vbs\" & \"%tmp%\\YlScZcZKSSeP.vbs\"”\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother SideWinder malware was using LNK\n\nIt will download a new stage by using this command.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother sample was related to ICDL malware, it was also using LNK\nISO -> LNK -> DLL\n\nIt contained these files, the document file contains the command to run the DLL library.\n\nAs we can see here, the command.\n\nAlso, we have found a new one related to Matanbuchus. Matanbuchus Loader is a new\nmalware-as-a-service created by a threat actor who references demonic themes in\nsoftware and usernames.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt appears as a normal file but contains malicious code within it, as we can see in the\nbelow screenshot\n\nThe malicious code will ping a malicious domain to create a new directory “ItF5”, and it will\ndownload new file as an image then change it to a new file, and run it.\n\n## IOCs:\n\nfa15b97a6bb4d34e84dfb060b7114a5d\n\na4e45d28631ea2dd178f314f1362f213\n\ne82abc3b442ca4828d84ebaa3f070246\n\nd1f00a08ecedd4aed664f5a0fb74f387\n\n567dde18d84ceb426dfd181492cee959\n\nff942b936242769123c61b5b76a4c7ad\n\nbfc3995ae78a66b857863ad032a311ae\n\n3952caf999263773be599357388159e0\n\n3053114b52f1f4b51d1639f8a93a8d4a\n\nac664772dc648e84aa3bec4de0c50c6c\n\n59923950923f8d1b5c7c9241335dff8c\n\n673ecadfd3f6f348c9d676fd1ed4389a\n\n27c86be535bedfb6891068f9381660ac\n\n75d993bbd6f20b5294c89ae5125c3451\n\nd2b90fa83209f7ca05d743c037f1f78c\n\n7d8d6338cf47b62524b746ef9530b07f\n\n\n-----\n\n3ac4a01e62766d2a447a515d9b346dbb\n2b41c35010693c4adffb43bfca65c122\n\n7b67f5c27df1ba2fb4a2843a9a24268b\n\n6a00d0a9e6c4ec79408393984172a635\n\n51c2e7a75c14303e09b76c9812641671\n\nd1a288f0ec71789621d1f6cce42973c8\n\n4abfe9a42ef90201a6fa6945deacfc86\n\nb58e53c6120c2f33749c4f3f31d2713d\n\n86dbd6d9376cec15f624685e1349dd86\n\n625ea570a70a4640c46c8eddc2f8c562\n\n59ddeeed7cb3198f3d961df323c314517a6c0ee096b894330b9e43e4d1dc9c5b\n\n5b99c3a4c9fd79a90fd7f2d0c743de73c4a4c053fb326752c061ce5ab6a1c16f\n\nc7d4272fd706f4a07973bc644501afc0d423a9cc47c21fd4cad45686c4a7cd80\n\nD9927533C620C8A499B386A375CB93C17634801F8E216550BD840D4DBDD4C5C6\n\ne722083fbfacdea81b4e86251c004a1b90f864928af1369aa021559cb55aba75\n\n115D7891A2ABBE038C12CCC9ED3CFEEDFDD1242E51BCC67BFA22C7CC2567FB10\n\n## References:\n\n- UAC-0010 (Armageddon) Activity targeting EU Countries\n\n[https://cert.gov.ua/article/39086](https://cert.gov.ua/article/39086)\n\n\n-----",
