Many of the (nation-state) threat actors will likely abuse this flaw if they were\nnot already abusing it. Like last month, an overview of this month’s observed cyber\noperations was shared by security researchers via Twitter. Where applicable, I will briefly\ndescribe the geopolitical tension between states. In this month’s overview, IOC’s from nationstate threat actors were selected that presumably originate from actors from Vietnam, China,\nIndia, and Pakistan, by basically searching for the keywords “apt“ and “c2:” or “c2” over the\n\n\n-----\n\ncollected Twitter data from June 2021. The reported IOC s have not been examined yet and\nare therefore weakly anchored with evidence. But let’s see what has been shared by security\nresearchers for June 2021.\n\n## Middle East\n\nFigure 1:Middle East\n\n### Gaza\n\nIn June, the following campaign was shared via Twitter by the alleged Palestinian threat\n[actor dubbed APT-C-23 or Desert Viper.](https://apt.thaicert.or.th/cgi-bin/showcard.cgi?g=Desert%20Falcons)\n```\n\"New #APT #APT-C-23 #micropsia sample md5：8c560cf2281320736e03f126d978ba28\nfilename:Experience or leadership skills experience or leadership skills.exe\nC2:howard-maria[.]me\nDrops generic CV template as decoy (cb142b1fe66cd3720b7d2cb054d50f82)\"\n\n```\nSome other malware samples were also shared on Twitter:\n```\n\"#APT-C-23 #AirdViper #CTI #APT e38c06f83a5c1b0a4f82c965a4c78654\n15398d1f1280c5b40deae7f91cc06b36\n5ea012cc4aca5eb4ff4211ae32dabb9d\n8bd5dd1fe94bf55a3fcf16d669a90686 \nhttps://t.co/fSzwFdHV9M\"\n\n```\nSome researchers on Twitter refer that the above samples might indicate that EgyptAir might\nbe a target of the actor.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n New sample seems used by #APT C 23. Once it gets executed, a document relating to\ninfomation about #EgyptAir is shown to confuse the victim and meanwhile #RAT is\nexecuted to perform remote control. \nhttps://t.co/vm1moMOxIW \nhttps://t.co/7NrAFW5duH\n823bf27b1e559d6607f5224ab99de1c83bb5d36e2ed0e6644d551e94ec45d248\n\"#APT-C-23 #AirdViper #CTI #APT\n335e604a7c3866b3fad6e8ee6989ddb9 \nThe position of the president and the leadership on the elections and the\ncorresponding proposals for the decrees https://t.co/KQ6yiTslm2\"\n\n### Iran\n\n```\nI will not go into disputes with other countries because there are many tensions between\nIran's neighbors or the United States. Iran as a country is protected by mountains that are\nnatural borders and is one of the highly populated and educated countries in the region.\nTherefore also a force to reckon with. There a multiple alleged nation-state actor groups that\n[originate from Iran. For an overview of actors, visit the threat actor card maintained by the](https://apt.thaicert.or.th/cgi-bin/listgroups.cgi?c=Iran&v=&s=&m=&x=)\nThai Cert. This month the following activity was observed of APT34 or Oilrig. One of the\nactor groups which is held responsible for the Shamoon attacks in 2012.\n```\n\"#APT \nSample from #APT34 Group:1858b880e23f1df3735f00719c2c28a3\nWe also spot an attack where DNS tunneling was used, suspected belong to #APT34, here\nare the captured samples:\na90ae3747764127decae5a0d7856ef95\ne2919dea773eb0796e46e126dbce17b1\"\n\"#APT34\n#oilrig\n63ff31ede9713c10ba6b6f965167cbbd\nab25014c3d6f77ec5880c8f9728be968\ne7737a2e170459905216622f2d43e4da\nhost:\\\"https://t.co/G6RQLX1vlH[.]lb\\\"\nusername:\\\"sig.dir.logistic\\\"\npassword:\\\"P@ssw0rdSigL0g\\\"\nto:\\\"masters.michelle@protonmail.com\\\"\"\n\n## Asia\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Dam tensions in Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam\n\n### Vietnam\n\n[China is building multiple dams on the Mekong river.

In June 2021, many potential campaigns from different nation-state actors were\nreported on Twitter by security researchers or threat hunters in areas with high geopolitical\ntensions. A brief overview of some of these actors for June was outlined. Further research\nneeds to be conducted if these IOCs can indeed be anchored to these aforementioned\nnation-states and understand more about their operations and victims. In the next article, I\nwill further assess one or two potential interesting TransparentTribe malware samples\n\n\n-----\n\ncovered in this article to determine if tracking for such an actor can be improved or to gain a\nbetter understanding of their operations. Until next time and sharing is caring!\n#TogetherWeAreStronger\n\n\n-----",
