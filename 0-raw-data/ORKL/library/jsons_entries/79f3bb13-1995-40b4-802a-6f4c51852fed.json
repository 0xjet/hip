This is the group behind the infamous Dridex banking trojan and Locky ransomware,\ndelivered through malicious email campaigns via Necurs botnet.\n\nOther [malware associated with TA505 include Philadelphia and](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/ta505_timeline_final4_0.png)\nGlobeImposter ransomware families.\n\n## ServHelper delivered in three campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\nA first salvo of malicious messages was shot on November 9, 2018. It was a small\ncampaign with several thousand emails delivering Word and Publisher documents laced\nwith hostile macros.\n\nA larger campaign with tens of thousands of emails occurred six days later and carried\nmessages with .DOC, .PUB, and .WIZ documents, all specific to the same Microsoft Office\ncomponents mentioned above.\n\nIn a third session, observed on December 13, the threat actor mixed in PDF files with URLs\npurporting to lead to an Adobe update. Following the link took the potential victim to a fake\n\"Adobe PDF Plugin\" webpage that led to ServHelper.\n\nProofpoint, who spotted these campaigns and analyzed the two malware families, says that\nthe distribution is not focused on a particular region on the world, and the focus is on\nfinancial services organizations.\n\nThe infrastructure used for running these campaigns remains unknown for the time being,\nbut it does not present the hallmarks specific to Necurs botnet.\n\n## Actively developed, ServHelper comes in two flavors\n\nThe purpose of the macro was to download and execute a variant of ServHelper that set up\nreverse SSH tunnels that enabled access to the infected host through the Remote Desktop\nProtocol (RDP) port 3389.\n\n\"Once ServHelper establishes remote desktop access, the malware contains functionality\nfor the threat actor to “hijack” legitimate user accounts or their web browser profiles and use\n[them as they see fit,\" researchers from Proofpoint explain in an analysis released today.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/servhelper-and-flawedgrace-new-malware-introduced-ta505)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe other ServHelper variant does not include the tunneling and hijacking capabilities and\nfunctions only as a downloader for the FlawedGrace RAT.\n\nServHelper is written in Delphi and its developers continue to update it with new features\nand commands. Proofpoint says that almost every new campaign reveals a changed variant\nof the malware.\n\n## Use of decentralized DNS\n\nTo protect the command and control (C2) servers against takedown efforts, the developer(s)\nuses the .bit Top-Level Domain (TLD) for the Domain Name System (DNS) servers.\n\nResearchers found two such DNS servers resolving the IP addresses for four ServHelper's\nC2 servers: dedsolutions[.]bit and arepos[.]bit.\n\nInternet TLDs like .com and .org and Country Code TLDs (ccTLD) designated for a\nparticular country are maintained by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and\nNumbers (ICANN).\n\n\n-----\n\nSecurity researchers and law enforcement agencies can ask ICANN to force a domain\nregistry or registrar to shut-down, seize or sinkhole a domain name.\n\nA .bit TLD does not fall under the umbrella of ICANN and is instead available through\nNamecoin cryptocurrency's blockchain transaction database.\n\nThe domain name is shared over a peer-to-peer network, making it fully decentralized and\nimmune to any government or organization's efforts to regulate, suspend, or sinkhole it.\nOther decentralized TLDs are .emc, .lib, .bazar, .coin.\n\nProofpoint told BleepingComputer that not all C2 infrastructure uses .bit domains and can\nbe taken down. \"In other cases, particularly those using crypto dns, defenders need to rely\non layered security to block related traffic,\" they added.\n\n## FlawedGrace is a tough nut to crack\n\nProofpoint is not at the first encounter with the FlawedGrace RAT, as the malware caught\nthe researchers' eye since early November 2017.\n\nAlthough multiple variants exist, some as early as August 2017, it was not seen actively\ndistributed until recently.\n\n\"Per the malware’s debug strings, significant development took place during the end of\n2017. The ServHelper campaigns were distributing version 2.0.10 of the malware [built on\nNovember 20, 2017],\" the researchers note in their report.\n\nThey also point out that FlawedGrace is a full-featured RAT written in C++ and that it is a\nvery large program that \"extensive use of object-oriented and multithreaded programming\ntechniques.\" As a consequence, getting familiar with its internal structure takes a lot of time\nand is far from a simple task.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter analyzing both malware families, the researchers were able to conclude that there are\nsufficient discrepancies in the coding style and techniques to be the work of different\ndevelopers.\n\n**Update [01.10.2019]: The article erroneously mentioned that Necurs botnet was used to**\nrun the email campaigns that delivered ServHelper and FlawedGrace malware. We have\nupdated it to reflect that and that the TA505 group is behind the new malware families. We\nalso included comments from Proofpoint.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[BPFDoor malware uses Solaris vulnerability to get root privileges](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bpfdoor-malware-uses-solaris-vulnerability-to-get-root-privileges/)\n\n[BPFDoor: Stealthy Linux malware bypasses firewalls for remote access](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bpfdoor-stealthy-linux-malware-bypasses-firewalls-for-remote-access/)\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[Fake Windows exploits target infosec community with Cobalt Strike](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-windows-exploits-target-infosec-community-with-cobalt-strike/)\n\n[Malicious PyPI package opens backdoors on Windows, Linux, and Macs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-pypi-package-opens-backdoors-on-windows-linux-and-macs/)\n\n[Backdoor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[Botnet](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/botnet/)\n[RAT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/rat/)\n[SSH](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ssh/)\n[TA505](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ta505/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
