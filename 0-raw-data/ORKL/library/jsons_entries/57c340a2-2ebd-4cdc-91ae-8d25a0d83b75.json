We do not have evidence directly linking these attacks to a government**\n\n**source, but the information derived from these activities supports an assessment that a group or**\n\n**groups with motivations similar to the stated position of the Chinese government in relation to**\n\n**these targets is involved.**\n\n**The goal of this report is to expose the tools, tactics and infrastructure deployed by Scarlet**\n\n**Mimic in order to increase awareness of this threat and decrease its operational success**\n\n**through deployment of prevention and detection countermeasures. From our vantage point, we**\n\n**are not able to identify which attacks have been successful against which organizations. But the**\n\n**fact that the tools Scarlet Mimic deploys have been under development for years suggests an**\n\n**active adversary that has been successful in some percentage of its operations. Based on our**\n\n**analysis, we are also seeing Scarlet Mimic start to expand its espionage efforts from PCs to**\n\n**mobile devices, marking an evolution in its tactics.**\n\n**Individuals and groups of all different types may become the target of cyber espionage**\n\n**campaigns. The most well known victims of cyber espionage are typically government**\n\n**organizations or high-tech companies, but it’s important to recognize that espionage-focused**\n\n**adversaries are tasked to collect information from many sources.**\n\n**The attacks we attribute to Scarlet Mimic have primarily targeted Uyghur and Tibetan activists**\n\n**as well as those who are interested in their causes. Both the Tibetan community and the**\n\n**Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority residing primarily in northwest China, have been targets of**\n\n**multiple sophisticated attacks in the past decade. Both also have history of strained**\n\n**relationships with the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), though we do not**\n\n**have evidence that links Scarlet Mimic attacks to the PRC.**\n\n**Scarlet Mimic attacks have also been identified against government organizations in Russia and**\n\n**India, who are responsible for tracking activist and terrorist activities. While we do not know the**\n\n**precise target of each of the Scarlet Mimic attacks, many of them align to the patterns described**\n\n**above.**\n\n**The Scarlet Mimic attacks primarily center around the use of a Windows backdoor named**\n\n**“FakeM.” It was first described by Trend Micro in 2013 and was named FakeM because its**\n\n**primary command and control traffic mimicked Windows Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger**\n\n**network traffic to evade detection. We have identified two subsequent variants of the FakeM**\n\n**family, which has undergone significant changes since it was exposed in 2013. We have also**\n\n**identified nine distinct “loader” malware families, which Scarlet Mimic appears to use to avoid**\n\n**detection when infecting a system.**\n\n**In addition to the FakeM variants, Scarlet Mimic has deployed Trojans that target the Mac OS X**\n\n**and Android operating systems. We have linked these attacks to Scarlet Mimic through analysis**\n\n**of their command and control (C2) infrastructure.**\n\n**To infect individuals with access to the data the actors desire, Scarlet Mimic deploys both spear-**\n\n**phishing and watering hole (strategic web compromise) attacks. Using these tactics they can**\n\n**directly target previously identified individuals (spear phishing) as well as unidentified individuals**\n\n**who are interested in a specific subject (watering hole). In their spear phishing attacks, Scarlet**\n\n**Mimic has exploited five separate vulnerabilities. However, in many cases they chose to forgo**\n\n**exploiting a software vulnerability and used self-extracting (SFX) RAR archives that use the**\n\n**Right-to-Left Override character to mask the true file extension, tricking victims into opening**\n\n**executable files.**\n\n**As with many other attackers who use spear-phishing to infect victims, Scarlet Mimic makes**\n\n**heavy use of “decoy” files These are legitimate documents that contain content relevant to the**\n\n\n## Scarlet Mimic: Years-Long Espionage Campaign Targets Minority Activists\n\n**[posted by Robert Falcone on January 24, 2016](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/robert-falcone/)**\n\n## Palo Alto Networks News of the Week – January 23\n\n**[posted by Anna Lough on January 23, 2016](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/anna-lough/)**\n\n## New Attacks Linked to C0d0s0 Group\n\n**[posted by Josh Grunzweig on January 22, 2016](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/josh-grunzweig/)**\n\n## Channel Scoop – January 22, 2016\n\n**[posted by Lang Tibbils on January 22, 2016](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/lang-tibbils/)**\n\n## The Power of User-ID\n\n**[posted by Stephen Perciballi on January 21, 2016](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/stephen-perciballi/)**\n\n**[MORE →](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/archives/)**\n\n\n**Select a Category**\n\n**Select a Month**\n\n**[MORE →](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/archives/)**\n\n\n## 2\n\n\n-----\n\n**target of the attack.**\n\n**The most recent Scarlet Mimic attacks we have identified were conducted in 2015 and suggest**\n\n**the group has a significant interest in both Muslim activists and those interested in critiques of**\n\n**the Russian government and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Based on their previous targets**\n\n**we suspect these individuals may be targeted based on the information they posses on activist**\n\n**groups.**\n\n**[The primary source of data used in this analysis is Palo Alto Networks WildFire, which analyzes](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/technologies/wildfire.html)**\n\n**malware used in attacks across the world.

The goal of this report is to help network defenders better**\n\n**understand attacks from a group we have named Scarlet Mimic. This group has been**\n\n**conducting attacks for at least four years using a backdoor Trojan that has been under active**\n\n**development. The group primarily deploys spear-phishing e-mails to infect its targets, but was**\n\n**also responsible for a watering hole (strategic web compromise) attack in 2013.**\n\n**Attacks from this group have been reported publicly in the past, but mostly as disparate,**\n\n**unconnected incidents. Based on analysis of the data and malware samples we have collected,**\n\n**Unit 42 believes the attacks described herein are the work of a group or set of cooperating**\n\n**groups who have a single mission, collecting information on minority groups who reside in and**\n\n**around northwestern China. In the past, Scarlet Mimic has primarily targeted individuals who**\n\n**belong to these minority groups as well as their supporters, but we’ve recently found evidence to**\n\n**indicate the group also targets individuals working inside government anti-terrorist**\n\n**organizations. We suspect these targets are selected based on their access to information**\n\n**about the targeted minority groups.**\n\n**In the following sections we will describe selected attacks we have identified and who their likely**\n\n**targets are. We will also provide detailed analysis of the latest variants of the malware they**\n\n**deploy (known as FakeM) as well as other associated tools that allow Scarlet Mimic to target**\n\n**Android and OS X devices.**\n\n**Attacks launched by this group were publicly exposed on 2013 in a Trend Micro report about the**\n\n**FakeM Trojan. Since that reports release, Scarlet Mimic has deployed two additional versions of**\n\n**the malware. They have also deployed nine separate “loader” Trojans they use to infect systems**\n\n**with their backdoor.**\n\n**The majority of attacks we associate with Scarlet Mimic follow the pattern shown in Figure 1.**\n\n**Figure 1: “Spear Phishing with Decoy” Attack Pattern Deployed by Scarlet Mimic**\n\n\n-----\n\n**content to trick the user into opening it. If the user opens the file and the exploitation is**\n\n**successful, a backdoor Trojan is installed on the system that gives the attacker access and a**\n\n**decoy document is displayed to the victim. Decoy documents are typically non-malicious**\n\n**versions of the content the user expected to see when opening the attachment.**\n\n**Many of the targets and spoofed or compromised sending e-mail addresses have contact**\n\n**information on the Internet. The apparent sender email usually appears to be someone**\n\n**associated with the accompanying text, when appropriate, while the target emails are usually**\n\n**also available online tied to target organizations. A small subset of the decoys could not be**\n\n**found online and may be from previous compromises by Scarlet Mimic.**\n\n**Many attackers deploy this particular pattern, as it is often successful at infecting a user without**\n\n**alerting the user of the infection. This is the exact same pattern, for example, deployed by the**\n\n**[attackers in Operation Lotus Blossom.](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/06/operation-lotus-blossom/)**\n\n**We have identified spear phishing documents from Scarlet Mimic exploiting the following**\n\n**vulnerabilities.**\n\n**CVE-2012-0158**\n\n**CVE-2010-3333**\n\n**CVE-2010-2883**\n\n**CVE-2010-2572**\n\n**CVE-2009-3129**\n\n**We also know Scarlet Mimic uses a number of toolkits to create documents that contain exploit**\n\n**code to install the FakeM payload on a compromised system. Unit 42 tracks the toolkits**\n\n**[delivering FakeM under the names MNKit, WingD and Tran Duy Linh. These kits appear to be](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/05/cmstar-downloader-lurid-and-enfals-new-cousin/)**\n\n**used by many attack groups, and they alone are not a good indication of Scarlet Mimic activity.**\n\n**Additionally, in many cases these threat actors did not use an exploit document at all, rather**\n\n**they sent self-extracting (SFX) RAR archives that use the Right-to-Left Override character to**\n\n**mask the true file extension. For example, the following two filenames of SFX archives used to**\n\n**deliver FakeM contain the RLO character (bolded):**\n\n**_Update about the status of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche’ashes%E2%80%AEcod.scr_**\n\n**_tepsiliy mezmun.\\xe2\\x80\\xaetxt.scr_**\n\n**Even when no software vulnerability is exploited, the attacks still typically include a decoy**\n\n**document. The content of most of the decoy documents appear to be available on the open**\n\n**Internet, and the attackers typically made small modifications to them.**\n\n**Many of the targets and spoofed or compromised sending accounts have contact information on**\n\n**the Internet.

A small subset of the decoys could not be found online and may be**\n\n**from previous compromises by Scarlet Mimic. The overarching decoy themes were Uyghur-**\n\n**related, anti-Putin, or Al-Qaeda-related. The decoys are often copied from think tanks or**\n\n**reputable news sources the targets would likely frequent.**\n\n**[In one instance, the threat actors used content from a New York Times article (Figure 2) on the](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/22/world/asia/chinese-police-are-said-to-seize-ashes-of-tibetan-monk-tenzin-delek-rinpoche.html?_r=0)**\n\n**same day it was published.**\n\n**Figure 2: Decoy Text Extracted from the New York Times article**\n\n**Figure 3 shows one of the more common themes used to target Uyghurs and those interested in**\n\n**their cause.

This document was particularly poorly altered, as the registration form**\n\n**still contained multiple hints to indicate the document was fraudulent (Figure 6c).**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6a: Original document used as a Psylo decoy**\n\n**Figure 6b: Modified header and contact email in the decoy**\n\n**Figure 6c: Bottom of the decoy document with replaced email and non-altered date — a quick**\n\n**search online shows this to be fraudulent**\n\n**In total we have collected over 40 individual decoy documents used in these attacks, far more**\n\n**than we can detail here.**\n\n**We are aware of one case where Scarlet Mimic broke from the spear-phishing pattern described**\n\n**above. In 2013, the group deployed a watering hole attack, also known as a strategic web**\n\n**compromise to infect victims with their backdoor. The watering hole is an attack vector that**\n\n**involves compromising a website that targeted victims are likely to visit in order to infect and**\n\n**[gain access to their systems. According to a blog by Websense, threat actors compromised the](http://community.websense.com/blogs/securitylabs/archive/2013/08/16/tibetan-compromise.aspx)**\n\n**Tibetan Alliance of Chicago’s website to host malicious code that exploited a vulnerability in**\n\n**Internet Explorer (CVE-2012-4969.) Microsoft patched this vulnerability in September 2012,**\n\n**suggesting that this watering hole attack used an older vulnerability, which aligns with the threat**\n\n**groups continued use of older vulnerabilities in their spear-phishing efforts.**\n\n**[First discussed in January 2013 in a Trend Micro whitepaper, FakeM is a Trojan that uses](http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-fakem-rat.pdf)**\n\n**separate modules to perform its functionality. FakeM’s functional code is shellcode-based and**\n\n**requires another Trojan to load it into memory and execute it. There are a variety of different**\n\n**Trojans used to load FakeM, some of which are more interesting than others. In this section, we**\n\n**will explore the loader Trojans followed by an analysis of the evolution of FakeM itself. We end**\n\n**this section with a discussion on tools related to FakeM and used by Scarlet Mimic.**\n\n**FakeM is shellcode-based and therefore requires another Trojan to load FakeM into memory**\n\n**and execute its functional code. Threat actors have developed many different loading Trojans to**\n\n**load FakeM, some of which are fairly straightforward while others use very clever techniques to**\n\n**avoid detection. Unit 42 tracks the following list of loader Trojans that Scarlet Mimic has used to**\n\n**execute FakeM:**\n\n**CrypticConvo**\n\n**SkiBoot**\n\n**RaidBase**\n\n**FakeHighFive**\n\n**PiggyBack**\n\n**FullThrottle**\n\n**FakeFish**\n\n**BrutishCommand**\n\n**SubtractThis**\n\n\n-----\n\n**but different C2 servers, as seen in the example in Table 1. This suggests the actors compile a**\n\n**single sample and use a builder tool to configure individual samples on demand.**\n\n**We used the loader Trojans to provide a general timeline for the development of FakeM**\n\n**samples, as FakeM is shellcode-based and does not contain any usable timestamps. The**\n\n**timestamps in the loader Trojans does not necessarily correspond to the usage of FakeM, but**\n\n**plotting the compile times of the loaders on a timeline shows an interesting trend. The scatter**\n\n**plot timeline in Figure 7 shows the known compilation times of the loader Trojans and the**\n\n**FakeM variant that it executed.**\n\n**SHA256** **Compiled** **Loader Trojan** **C2 Domains**\n\n\n**5182dc8667432d76a**\n\n**276dc4f864cdfcef3e4**\n\n**81783ebaf46d3b139**\n\n**7080b798f4a**\n\n**5dade00db195087aa**\n\n**336ce190b5fd1c2299**\n\n**2c49556c623b42a9f7**\n\n**42d73241a7f**\n\n\n**2013-09-13**\n\n**08:02:58**\n\n**2013-09-13**\n\n**08:02:58**\n\n\n**CrypticConvo** **opero.spdns[.]org,**\n\n**firefox.spdns[.]de**\n\n**CrypticConvo** **intersecurity.firewall-**\n\n**gateway[.]com**\n\n\n**Table 1: Two samples sharing a compile time yet contain different C2 domains in their**\n\n**configurations**\n\n**Figure 7: Timeline of compilation of loader Trojans associated with FakeM**\n\n**Based on the timeline, it appears that the actors were actively developing several of the loaders**\n\n**at the same time from 2009 until the early months of 2014. After the first quarter of 2014, it**\n\n**appears that the actors abandoned development of the older loaders in favor of FakeFish,**\n\n**BrutishCommand and SubtractThis. This does not mean that actors will not continue to use the**\n\n**older loaders, but it does suggest that the actors will continue including the newer or freshly**\n\n**developed loaders in updated builder applications.**\n\n**The timeline also presents the possibility that the FakeM developers reacted to the release of**\n\n**[Trend Micro’s FakeM blog and whitepaper. Trend Micro published their analysis of the FakeM](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/hiding-in-plain-sight-the-fakem-remote-access-trojan/)**\n\n**Trojan on January 17, 2013 (marked in Figure 7 by a red line) that discussed the original variant**\n\n**of FakeM. Shortly after, the original variant of FakeM drops off the timeline in favor of the SSL**\n\n**and Custom SSL variants. It is possible that the FakeM developers saw their tool was exposed**\n\n**and adapted it to avoid detection for continued use as a payload in attacks. We cannot be**\n\n**certain if the developers reacted specifically to Trend Micro’s content, as it is possible that they**\n\n**were reacting to the increased antivirus detection rate of their tool that resulted from the**\n\n**exposure of the tool. Regardless of the specific stimulus, the reaction shows that the FakeM**\n\n**threat actors evolved to avoid detection/attribution and to continue their attack campaigns.**\n\n**The timeline does have one noticeable outlier, specifically the FakeHighFive sample compiled in**\n\n**September 2009 that loaded a FakeM SSL sample. We believe this compile time is incorrect, as**\n\n**the C2 domain for this sample, specifically press.ufoneconference[.]com, was registered by the**\n\n**threat actor in February 2013. The registration of the C2 domain in February 2013 aligns with**\n\n**other compilation times of FakeM SSL, which leads us to the conclusion that the September**\n\n**2009 compilation timestamp was modified and/or inaccurate.**\n\n**Most of the related loader Trojans, such as CrypticConvo, PiggyBack, FullThrottle,**\n\n**FakeHighFive, FakeFish and RaidBase do little more than load encrypted FakeM shellcode**\n\n**(either from a PE resource or embedded data), decrypt it, and execute the resulting shellcode.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The SubtractThis loader displays a technique that is quite clever. This loader received its name**\n\n**based on a technique it uses to delay before carrying out its main functionality, specifically by**\n\n**requiring the user to hit the minus (“-“) key. SubtractThis carries out this technique through the**\n\n**following steps:**\n\n**1. Calls LoadAcceleratorsA function to load the virtual key for the minus character “-“. Example:**\n\n**LoadAcceleratorsA(hInstance, VK_SUBTRACT);**\n\n**2. Calls SetTimer function to set up a callback function that will be called in the event that the**\n\n**LB_FINDSTRING Windows message. Example: SetTimer(0, LB_FINDSTRING_, 10000u,**\n\n**TimerFunc);**\n\n**3. Creates a continuous loop that starts by calling GetMessageA to obtain Windows messages**\n\n**4. Calls TranslateAcceleratorA to check Windows message received is VK_SUBTRACT “-“.**\n\n**5. Calls the callback function set up in the SetTimer function if the user enters the minus “-“ key.**\n\n**This technique requires user interaction, which makes analysis in sandboxes more difficult.**\n\n**The BrutishCommand loader uses a very interesting method to decrypt the FakeM functional**\n\n**code. The main function in this loader checks the command line arguments passed to it, and if**\n\n**there are none present it will obtain a random number between 0-9 and create a new process**\n\n**using the same executable with this random number as a command line argument.**\n\n**If the executable has a command line argument, the Trojan subjects the value to a hashing**\n\n**algorithm and compares the hash to 0x20E3EEBA. If the value matches the static hash, the**\n\n**executable will subject the command line argument to a second algorithm that will produce a**\n\n**value that the Trojan will use as the decryption key to decrypt the embedded FakeM shellcode.**\n\n**It essentially brute forces its own decryption key by rerunning itself over and over until it runs**\n\n**with the correct value is provided on the command line. Unit 42 had not seen this technique**\n\n**used by other malware families and it introduces a challenging hurdle when attempting to**\n\n**analyze or debug the loader Trojan.**\n\n**SkiBoot reads the master boot record (MBR) of the system to determine the XOR key that it will**\n\n**use to decrypt the FakeM shellcode. It carries out this functionality by calling the ReadFile**\n\n**function to read 512-bytes from “\\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE0” and specifically uses the last byte of the**\n\n**MBR as the encryption key. The last byte of the MBR is “\\xAA”, or the second byte of**\n\n**“\\x55\\xAA”, which is the boot signature portion of the MBR.**\n\n**Instead of using ReadFile, one variant of this loader reads the MBR using DeviceIOControl**\n\n**using the ID_CMD control code, and accesses a specific offset to obtain the value that it will**\n\n**rotate each byte in the ciphertext within the decryption algorithm. The significance of using**\n\n**DeviceIOControl is that the VMware hypervisor responds to this API call with a blank buffer**\n\n**instead of the MBR, whereas the Virtualbox hypervisor returns the MBR correctly. It appears**\n\n**that this loader is specifically using the DeviceIOControl API function as a VMware detection**\n\n**technique, suggesting that the developers are well versed in the nuances of the VMware**\n\n**hypervisor and virtual machine evasion.**\n\n**Since being originally exposed in 2013, authors of FakeM have continuously made changes to**\n\n**the FakeM codebase, resulting in multiple variants. Before elaborating on the different variants**\n\n**of FakeM, there are many similarities that remain throughout the various iterations. The**\n\n**architecture has not changed during the evolution of FakeM, as a modular framework exists in**\n\n**each variant, as seen in Figure 8. The FakeM main module is responsible for launching**\n\n**embedded modules, such as a keylogger or for gathering sensitive files. The main module is**\n\n**also responsible for communicating with its C2 servers and handling commands issued by the**\n\n**C2 server.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**All FakeM variants initiate communications with its C2 server and check the C2’s response for a**\n\n**command. Also, all FakeM variants share a common command handler with the same**\n\n**capabilities, as seen in Table 2. The limited command set suggests that FakeM’s functionality is**\n\n**obtained by additional assembly code provided by the C2 server with the 0x211 command.**\n\n**According to Trend Micro’s initial analysis on FakeM, threat actors delivered and ran additional**\n\n**code that provided further capabilities to the Trojan, such as the ability to run shell commands,**\n\n**steal passwords, capture the screen and upload files.**\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n**0x211** **Run assembly code directly from the C2.**\n\n**0x212** **Idle. Attempts to receive another command immediately instead**\n\n**of sleeping for 30 seconds.**\n\n**0x213** **Sets a flag to end the session with the C2. This will force the**\n\n**Trojan to reestablish a session with the C2.**\n\n**0x214** **Exit process.**\n\n**Table 2: Command handler within all variants of FakeM**\n\n**Now that we have covered the commonalities between FakeM variants, the following sections**\n\n**will dive into the specific variants of FakeM. Unit 42 categorizes the different variations of FakeM**\n\n**based on the method used to communicate with the C2 server, which has changed dramatically**\n\n**over the years.**\n\n**The original variant of FakeM generates network beacons to its C2 server that begin with a 32-**\n\n**byte header that in most cases is meant to blend into network traffic generated by legitimate**\n\n**applications. Following this 32-byte header, the original variant of FakeM includes data**\n\n**encrypted using a custom encryption cipher that uses an XOR key of “YHCRA” and bit rotation**\n\n**between each XOR operation.**\n\n**The original variant includes the FakeM discovered and published by Trend Micro in 2013, in**\n\n**which the authors of FakeM first attempted to evade detection of its C2 communications by**\n\n**pretending to be generated by legitimate messenger applications, such as MSN and Yahoo!**\n\n**messengers. Figures 9 and 10 show FakeM attempting to resemble MSN or Yahoo! Messenger**\n\n**traffic, as the first 32-bytes contain data that resemble legitimate traffic generated by these chat**\n\n**programs.**\n\n**Figure 9: FakeM using fake MSN messenger traffic for C2 communication**\n\n**Figure 10: FakeM using fake Yahoo! Messenger for C2 communication**\n\n**In addition to emulating chat programs, FakeM has also included HTML code within the 32-byte**\n\n**header. As you can see in Figure 11, the overall structure of the beacon did not change, rather**\n\n**the only differences is the data in the header contains HTML tags. The HTML data in the**\n\n**[header led Unit 42 to a whitepaper published by Malware.lu that suggested the MSN, Yahoo,](https://malware.lu/assets/files/articles/RAP002_APT1_Technical_backstage.1.0.pdf)**\n\n**and HTML versions of the original variant of FakeM all share a common server application that**\n\n**the threat actors use to build samples and control infected systems.**\n\n**Figure 11: FakeM HTML tags in C2 header**\n\n\n-----\n\n**bytes to fill this portion of the packet, as seen in Figure 12. Unit 42 tracks this under the original**\n\n**variant, as it uses the same algorithm to encrypt the data and otherwise shares a common**\n\n**structure to the MSN, Yahoo, and HTML versions with the exception of the modification to the**\n\n**first 32 bytes.**\n\n**Figure 12: FakeM C2 beacon with four repeating bytes**\n\n**While performing infrastructure analysis on FakeM original variants, we came across shared**\n\n**infrastructure with domains that hosted C2 servers for malware samples that did not match the**\n\n**known FakeM communication protocols. Palo Alto Networks WildFire had analyzed many**\n\n**samples associated with these related C2 domains, all of which communicated with the C2**\n\n**server using secure sockets layer (SSL). To determine the malware family that was generating**\n\n**this traffic, Unit 42 analyzed these samples and found that the functional code was the same as**\n\n**the original FakeM variant.**\n\n**This discovery indicates the authors of FakeM introduced new code to the Trojan in order to use**\n\n**SSL to communicate with its C2 server. The drastic change in C2 channel warranted a new**\n\n**variant name, and we dubbed it “FakeM SSL”. During the analysis of these samples we did not**\n\n**find any operational C2 servers to complete a handshake to establish a SSL session. During the**\n\n**handshake, the FakeM SSL samples will tell the server it supports 36 different cipher suites**\n\n**even though the samples appear to only support one. Unit 42 believes the cipher suite within**\n\n**the FakeM SSL variants uses Diffie-Hellman for key exchange and the RC4 cipher to encrypt**\n\n**the C2 communications.**\n\n**In July 2015, Scarlet Mimic delivered a spear-phishing email to a branch of the Russian**\n\n**government with intentions of installing a payload that was undetected by any antivirus vendors**\n\n**on VirusTotal. The high profile target and the lack of antivirus detection prompted Unit 42 to**\n\n**perform an in-depth analysis and found that it is yet another new variant of the FakeM Trojan.**\n\n**We also named this variant after it’s communication protocol (FakeM Custom SSL.)**\n\n**This new variant of FakeM shared the same functional code as its predecessors, but again the**\n\n**communications with the C2 dramatically differed from the other variants. Communications**\n\n**between this variant and the C2 server leverage what Unit 42 believes is modified SSL code, as**\n\n**the code is very similar to the FakeM SSL variant. The code appears to use Diffie-Hellman for**\n\n**key exchange and the RC4 algorithm like FakeM SSL; however, the initial packet sent to the C2**\n\n**server did not contain a “client hello” message, which is required to initiate an SSL handshake.**\n\n**Instead, the initial packet sent data as seen in Figure 13.**\n\n**Figure 13: Hexdump of FakeM custom SSL variant**\n\n**This variant of FakeM skips the traditional SSL handshake, which involves an agreement on a**\n\n**cipher suite to use to encrypt communications. The FakeM code only supports one cipher suite,**\n\n**which makes the cipher suite agreement portion of the SSL handshake irrelevant. Instead,**\n\n**FakeM creates a session with its C2 server by exchanging keys. The lack of a valid handshake**\n\n**makes detection of this C2 stream difficult, as the packets sent between the Trojan and the C2**\n\n**to establish this session contain random binary data. Network devices will also be unable to**\n\n**perform any SSL decryption due to the lack of detection and the inability to determine the cipher**\n\n**suite used to encrypt the data. Figure 14 below provides a visual depiction of the handshake**\n\n**procedure and the subsequent beacon and command messages.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 14: Communications between system and C2 server, including the key exchange**\n\n**The handshake starts with a key exchange, which the Trojan initiates by creating a 2048-byte**\n\n**buffer that it will store its key (128-bytes, followed by null values as seen in Figure 13) and**\n\n**sending its key to the C2 server. The C2 will respond with its own key (also 128-bytes, followed**\n\n**by null values) that the Trojan will store and use to encrypt future communications.**\n\n**Once this key exchange is complete, the Trojan acknowledges the receipt of the server’s key by**\n\n**sending another 2048-byte packet to the server. To build the acknowledgement packet, the**\n\n**Trojan creates a 2048-byte buffer filled with null values and copies the string “ws32.dll” to offset**\n\n**8 and encrypts the buffer with the server’s key.**\n\n**After sending the acknowledgement packet, the Trojan will gather local system information and**\n\n**include it in a beacon to the C2 server. Like the packets sent in the key exchange, the beacon**\n\n**sent by the Trojan to the C2 server is 2048-bytes in length; however, the system information**\n\n**gathered by the Trojan is only 296 bytes followed by 1752 are null values to fill the 2048 byte**\n\n**buffer. The system information follows the 296-byte structure seen below:**\n\n\n**1**\n**2**\n**3**\n**4**\n**5**\n**6**\n**7**\n**8**\n**9**\n\n\n**struct** **beaconToC2** **{**\n**DWORD static_value_130h;**\n**CHAR** **username[128];**\n**CHAR** **computername[128];**\n**DWORD static_value_70000h;**\n**DWORD os_codepage;**\n**DWORD campaign_code_1;**\n**DWORD campaign_code_2;**\n**};**\n\n\n**The Trojan will encrypt this data using the key provided by the C2 and send it to the server.

This Trojan was**\n\n**delivered in targeted attacks on Uyghur activists in 2013 and used infrastructure associated with**\n\n**FakeM.**\n\n**[In February 2013, AlienVault performed analysis on the CallMe Trojan and found that it is based](https://www.alienvault.com/open-threat-exchange/blog/cyber-espionage-campaign-against-the-uyghur-community-targeting-macosx-syst)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n**1** **Get a file from the system and upload it to the C2 server.**\n\n**2** **Put a file on the system from the C2 server.

This suggests**\n\n**that not only do these threat actors have the ability to compromise victims running the Microsoft**\n\n**Windows operating system, but they can also target individuals running Apple’s OSX as well.**\n\n**During infrastructure analysis of FakeM Custom SSL variants, Unit 42 found infrastructure**\n\n**overlaps between FakeM and another new, previously unreported Trojan that we named “Psylo”.**\n\n**Psylo is a tool that allows threat actors to upload and download files to and from a compromised**\n\n**system, as well as execute commands and applications on the system. The name Psylo is an**\n\n**anagram from the mutex created when initially running this payload, which is ‘hnxlopsyxt’.**\n\n**Psylo is similar to FakeM in that they are both shellcode-based, and they have similar**\n\n**configurations and C2 communication channels. As you can see from the following two**\n\n**configuration structures, Psylo and FakeM have similar configurations with only the array length**\n\n**of the C2 locations being different.**\n\n\n**struct psylo_c2_config {char[60]**\n\n**c2_host_1;char[60] c2_host_2;char[60]**\n\n**c2_host_3;DWORD**\n\n**c2_port_1;DWORD c2_port_2;DWORD**\n\n**c2_port_3;};**\n\n\n**struct fakem_customssl_c2_config**\n\n**{char[64] c2_host_1;char[64]**\n\n**c2_host_2;char[64] c2_host_3;DWORD**\n\n**c2_port_1;DWORD c2_port_2;DWORD**\n\n**c2_port_3;};**\n\n\n**Figure 15: Comparison between Psylo and FakeM custom SSL configurations**\n\n**Both use SSL to communicate with their C2 servers, and it appears they share common code to**\n\n**carry out the Diffie Hellman key exchange. We compared the Diffie Hellman code from Psylo**\n\n**with FakeM custom SSL variant and found that they were very similar, but the FakeM samples**\n\n**had some of the functionality within sub-functions, which rendered binary diffing between the**\n\n**two Trojans impossible.**\n\n**Another slight difference involves how Psylo and FakeM generate random numbers for SSL.**\n\n**FakeM uses QueryPerformanceCounter to create a random number, whereas Psylo uses**\n\n**CryptGenRandom, both of which generate random numbers 68 bytes long. Interesting enough**\n\n**is that CryptGenRandom calls RtlGenRandom, which uses QueryPerformanceCounter along**\n\n**with other system attributes to generate a random number.**\n\n**When communicating with its C2 server, Psylo will use HTTPS with a unique user-agent of**\n\n**(notice the lack of a space between “5.0” and “(Windows”):**\n\n**_Mozilla/5.0(Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0_**\n\n**Unit 42 does not consider Psylo another variant of FakeM because Psylo has a command**\n\n**handler that differs dramatically from FakeM. Table 5 shows the Psylo command handler, which**\n\n**suggests it is less modular and supports more embedded functionality when compared to**\n\n**FakeM.

Unit 42 tracks this**\n\n**mobile Trojan as MobileOrder, as the authors specifically refer to commands within the app as**\n\n**orders. The connection between FakeM, Psylo, and MobileOrder suggest that Scarlet Mimic is**\n\n**now expanding their espionage efforts from PCs to mobile devices, which marks a major shift in**\n\n**tactics.**\n\n**MobileOrder starts by registering itself as device administrator so that a normal user cannot**\n\n**uninstall it by simply clicking “uninstall” in settings. It will copy an embedded PDF file from**\n\n**“res/raw/rd.pdf” to SD card**\n\n**“/android/9074ca3f18e201c204ec1d852264bb5432644ba46f54f361a146957.pdf” and launches**\n\n**the mobile device’s default PDF viewer to display this PDF file, which acts as a decoy document.**\n\n**After displaying the decoy document, the malicious code runs in background. The malicious**\n\n**code consists of the following parts:**\n\n**[1. An Android geographical location SDK provided by AMAP.](http://lbs.amap.com/)**\n\n**2. Actor developed code that carries out Trojan’s functionality.**\n\n**The malware uses the AMAP SDK to get accurate location of infected devices by GPS, mobile**\n\n**network (such as base stations), WiFi and other information. MobileOrder acts on instructions**\n\n**provided by its C2 server, which it communicates with over TCP port 3728. All C2**\n\n**communications are encrypted with the AES algorithm using a key generated by computing five**\n\n**MD5 hashes starting with the key “1qazxcvbnm”, and adding a salt value of “.)1/” in each**\n\n**iteration.**\n\n**The C2 server will respond to requests from MobileOrder with commands that the Trojan refers**\n\n**to as “orders”. MobileOrder contains a command handler with functionality that provides a fairly**\n\n**robust set of commands, as seen in Table 6. The first byte of data provided by the C2 server is**\n\n**order number, which is followed by the encrypted data that needed to carry out the specific**\n\n**order.**\n\n**Order #** **Order Name** **Behaviors**\n\n**18** **Order_Folder_List** **Upload names and attributes of files**\n\n**under specified path**\n\n**20** **Order_Process_List** **Upload all running processes information**\n\n**24** **Order_HostInfo** **Upload device information including**\n\n**IMEI, IMSI, SIM card serial number,**\n\n**phone number, Android version, device**\n\n**manufacturer, device model, SD card**\n\n**size, network type, device locking status,**\n\n**country, carrier, time zone, language,**\n\n**install app list, browser bookmarks, etc.**\n\n**26** **Order_FileDelete** **Delete specified file**\n\n**27** **Order_DownLoad** **Download specified file to SD card’s**\n\n**Android/data/tmp/ directory.**\n\n**28** **Order_UpFile** **Upload specified file to C2 server**\n\n**51** **Order_Sms** **Upload all received and sent SMS**\n\n**addresses, content, date, time to C2**\n\n**server**\n\n**52** **Order_Contact** **Upload all contacts’ information to C2**\n\n**server**\n\n**53** **Order_Call** **Upload all phone calling history**\n\n**information**\n\n**54** **Order_Camera_front_photo** **Take a picture by device’s front camera**\n\n**56** **Order_SetSleepTime** **Set sleep time interval**\n\n**57** **Order_SetOnline** **Stop sleep**\n\n**58** **Order_SetMediaRecorder** **Start audio recorder in specified time**\n\n**59** **Order_GetLoc** **Upload information about network**\n\n**operator, MCC, MNC, network type,**\n\n**GSM cell location, CID, LAS, BSSS, etc.**\n\n**This information can be used to locate**\n\n**the device.**\n\n**60** **Order_GetGps** **Upload GPS location by AMAP SDK.**\n\n**61** **Order_SetTelRecorderOn** **Activate phone calling recording**\n\n**62** **Order_SetTelRecorderOff** **Deactivate phone calling recording**\n\n**81** **Order_Install** **Install specified APK file.

There are also infrastructure ties**\n\n**between some FakeM variants and older activity using Trojans such as Elirks, Poison Ivy, and**\n\n**BiFrost, which were used in attacks as old as 2009. The domain names used to host C2 servers**\n\n**are a mix of actor-registered and Dynamic DNS (DDNS,) though most are DDNS. The DDNS**\n\n**domains in turn are linked to a small grouping of ASNs, with one ASN often largely tied to one**\n\n**FakeM variant. Most of the FakeM MSN C2s resolve to IP addresses associated with ASN**\n\n**22781 (RBLHST – Reliablehosting.com). However, we found one MSN sample that shared**\n\n**infrastructure with some FakeM Custom SSL variants.**\n\n**There is a similar overlap between FakeM MSN, FakeM HTML, and FakeM SSL. The registrant**\n\n**email xsldmt@xj163[.]cn was used to register several domains used as C2s: yourturbe[.]org,**\n\n**websurprisemail[.]com and googmail[.]org. One of these domains was also used in the 2013**\n\n**CallMe activity at the same time it was being used for FakeM MSN samples. The targeting and**\n\n**decoy style also matches with the FakeM activity.**\n\n**There is PE resource overlap between some FakeM MSN samples and some samples of the**\n\n**BiFrost and Poison Ivy Trojan. This may indicate that the same developer who created the**\n\n**particular BiFrost and Poison Ivy samples was also involved in developing FakeM MSN. Unit 42**\n\n**found an overlap between the RT_VERSION resources, which contains the version information**\n\n**of a Portable Executable (PE) file, shared amongst the three different Trojans. The shared**\n\n**RT_VERSION resource (MD5: 55b7a118203a831cc69b37b785015c54) contained the following**\n\n**information:**\n\n### Comments: Release\n\n CompanyName: Develop Team\n\n FileDescription: Utility Application\n\n FileVersion: 4.0\n\n InternalName: Utility\n\n LegalCopyright: Copyright (C) 2008\n\n LegalTrademarks: DT.Inc\n\n OriginalFilename: Utility.EXE\n\n PrivateBuild: 4.0b\n\n ProductName: Utility Application\n\n ProductVersion: 4.0\n\n**The overlap between Elirks, FakeM SSL, Psylo, and MobileOrder exists entirely in their**\n\n**command and control infrastructure, through domain names and/or IP resolution.
