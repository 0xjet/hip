vector\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qbot-malware-switches-to-new-windows-installer-infection-vector/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qbot-malware-switches-to-new-windows-installer-infection-vector/)**\n\nSergiu Gatlan\n\nBy\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nApril 11, 2022\n04:58 PM\n0\n\nThe Qbot botnet is now pushing malware payloads via phishing emails with passwordprotected ZIP archive attachments containing malicious MSI Windows Installer packages.\n\nThis is the first time the Qbot operators are using this tactic, switching from their standard\nway of delivering the malware via phishing emails dropping Microsoft Office documents with\nmalicious macros on targets' devices.\n\nSecurity researchers suspect this move might be a direct reaction to Microsoft announcing\n[plans to kill malware delivery via VBA Office macros in February after](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-plans-to-kill-malware-delivery-via-office-macros/) disabling Excel 4.0\n(XLM) macros by default in January.\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft has begun rolling out the VBA macro autoblock feature to Office for Windows users\nin early April 2022, starting with Version 2203 in the Current Channel (Preview) and to other\nrelease channels and older versions later.\n\n\"Despite the varying email methods attackers are using to deliver Qakbot, these campaigns\nhave in common their use of malicious macros in Office documents, specifically Excel 4.0\nmacros,\" Microsoft [said in December.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/09/a-closer-look-at-qakbots-latest-building-blocks-and-how-to-knock-them-down/)\n\n\"It should be noted that while threats use Excel 4.0 macros as an attempt to evade detection,\nthis feature is now disabled by default and thus requires users to enable it manually for such\nthreats to execute properly.\"\n\nThis is a significant security improvement towards protecting Office customers since using\nmalicious VBA macros embedded in Office documents is a prevalent method to push a large\n[assortment of malware strains in phishing attacks, including Qbot,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qbot-uses-windows-defender-antivirus-phishing-bait-to-infect-pcs/) [Emotet,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malwares-new-red-dawn-attachment-is-just-as-dangerous/) [TrickBot,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-trickbot-campaign-spamming-malicious-complaint-doc-attachments/)\n[and Dridex.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dridex-omicron-phishing-taunts-with-funeral-helpline-number/)\n\n## What is Qbot?\n\n[Qbot (also known as Qakbot,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/qbot/) [Quakbot, and](https://www.pandasecurity.com/en-us/security-info/49620/information/Quakbot.A) [Pinkslipbot) is a modular Windows banking](http://contagiodump.blogspot.com/2010/11/template.html)\ntrojan with worm features used since at least 2007 to steal banking credentials, personal\ninformation, and financial data, as well as to drop backdoors on compromised computers and\ndeploy Cobalt Strike beacons.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis malware is also known for infecting other devices on a compromised network using\n[network share exploits and highly aggressive brute-force attacks targeting Active Directory](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/banking-trojan-locks-users-out-of-active-directory-domains/)\nadmin accounts.\n\nAlthough active for over a decade, the Qbot malware has been primarily used in highly\ntargeted attacks against corporate entities since they provide a higher return on investment.\n\nMultiple ransomware gangs, including REvil, Egregor, ProLock, PwndLocker, and\nMegaCortex, have also used Qbot to breach corporate networks.\n\nSince Qbot infections can lead to dangerous infections and highly disruptive attacks, IT\nadmins and security professionals need to become familiar with this malware, the tactics it's\nusing to spread throughout a network, and those used by the botnet operators to deliver it to\nnew targets.\n\n[A Microsoft report from December 2021 captured the versatility of Qbot attacks, making it](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-these-are-the-building-blocks-of-qbot-malware-attacks/)\nharder to evaluate the scope of its infections accurately.\n\n### Related
