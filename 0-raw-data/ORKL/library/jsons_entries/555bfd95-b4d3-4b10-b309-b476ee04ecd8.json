Contact:\n\n[intelreports@kaspersky.com](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## Introduction:\n\nOver the last few years, the number of “APT­related” incidents\n\ndescribed in the media has grown significantly. For many of\n\nthese, though, the designation “APT”, indicating an “Advanced\n\nPersistent Threat”, is usually an exaggeration. With some notable\n\nexceptions, few of the threat actors usually described in the\n\nmedia are advanced. These exceptions, which in our opinion\n\nrepresent the pinnacle of cyberespionage tools: the truly\n\n\n-----\n\n“ProjectSauron”, also known as “Strider”.\n\nWhat differentiates a truly advanced threat actor from a wannabe\n\nAPT? Here are a few features that characterize the ‘top’\n\ncyberespionage groups:\n\nThe use of zero day exploits\n\nUnknown, never identified infection vectors\n\nHave compromised multiple government organizations in\n\nseveral countries\n\nHave successfully stolen information for many years before\n\nbeing discovered\n\nHave the ability to steal information from air gapped networks\n\nSupport multiple covert exfiltration channels on various\n\nprotocols\n\nMalware modules which can exist only in memory without\n\ntouching the disk\n\nUnusual persistence techniques which sometime use\n\nundocumented OS features\n\n“ProjectSauron” easily covers many of these points.\n\n## From discovery to detection:\n\nWhen talking about long­standing cyber­espionage campaigns,\n\nmany people wonder why it took so long to catch them. Perhaps\n\none of the explanations is having the right tools for the right job.\n\nTrying to catch government or military grade malware requires\n\nspecialized technologies and products. One such product is\n\nKaspersky’s AntiTargeted Attacks Platform, KATA\n\n(http://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise­security/anti­targeted­\n\nattack­platform). In September 2015, our anti­targeted attack\n\ntechnologies caught a previously unknown attack. The suspicious\n\nmodule was an executable library, loaded in the memory of a\n\nWindows domain controller (DC). The library was registered as a\n\nWindows password filter and had access to sensitive data in\n\ncleartext. Additional research revealed signs of massive activity\n\nfrom a new threat actor that we codenamed ‘ProjectSauron’,\n\nresponsible for large­scale attacks against key governmental\n\nentities in several countries.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_“SAURON” – internal name used in the LUA scripts_**\n\nProjectSauron comprises a top­of­the­top modular cyber­\n\nespionage platform in terms of technical sophistication, designed\n\nto enable long­term campaigns through stealthy survival\n\nmechanisms coupled with multiple exfiltration methods. Technical\n\ndetails show how attackers learned from other extremely\n\nadvanced actors in order to avoid repeating their mistakes. For\n\nexample, all artifacts are customized per given target, reducing\n\ntheir value as indicators of compromise for any other victim.\n\nSome other key features of ProjectSauron:\n\nIt is a modular platform designed to enable long­term cyber­\n\nespionage campaigns.\n\nAll modules and network protocols use strong encryption\n\nalgorithms, such as RC6, RC5, RC4, AES, Salsa20, etc.\n\nIt uses a modified LUA scripting engine to implement the core\n\nplatform and its plugins.\n\nThere are upwards of 50 different plugin types.\n\nThe actor behind ProjectSauron has a high interest in\n\ncommunication encryption software widely used by targeted\n\ngovernmental organizations. It steals encryption keys,\n\nconfiguration files, and IP addresses of the key infrastructure\n\nservers related to the encryption software.\n\nIt is able to exfiltrate data from air­gapped networks by using\n\nspecially­prepared USB storage drives where data is stored in\n\nan area invisible to the operation system.\n\nThe platform makes extensive use of the DNS protocol for\n\ndata exfiltration and real­time status reporting.\n\nThe APT was operational as early as June 2011 and\n\nremained active until April 2016.\n\nThe initial infection vector used to penetrate victim networks\n\nremains unknown.\n\nThe attackers utilize legitimate software distribution channels\n\nfor lateral movement within infected networks.\n\nTo help our readers better understand the ProjectSauron attack\n\n\n-----\n\nthe most important points about this attacker and its tools. A brief\n\ntechnical report is also available, including IOCs and Yara rules.\n\nOur colleagues from Symantec have also released their analysis\n\non ProjectSauron / Strider. You can read it here:\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/strider­cyberespionage­\n\ngroup­turns­eye­sauron­targets\n\n## ProjectSauron FAQ:\n\n### 1. What is ProjectSauron?\n\nProjectSauron is the name for a top level modular cyber­\n\nespionage platform, designed to enable and manage long­term\n\ncampaigns through stealthy survival mechanisms coupled with\n\nmultiple exfiltration methods.\n\nTechnical details show how attackers learned from other\n\nextremely advanced actors in order to avoid repeating their\n\nmistakes. As such, all artifacts are customized per given target,\n\nreducing their value as indicators of compromise for any other\n\nvictim.\n\nUsually APT campaigns have a geographical nexus, aimed at\n\nextracting information within a specific region or from a given\n\nindustry. That usually results in several infections in countries\n\nwithin that region, or in the targeted industry around the world.\n\nInterestingly, ProjectSauron seems to be dedicated to just a\n\ncouple of countries, focused on collecting high value intelligence\n\nby compromising almost all key entities it could possibly reach\n\nwithin the target area.\n\nThe name, ProjectSauron reflects the fact that the code authors\n\nrefer to ‘Sauron’ in the LUA scripts.\n\n### 2. Who are the victims?\n\nUsing our telemetry, we found more than 30 infected\n\norganizations in Russia, Iran, Rwanda and possibly in Italian­\n\nspeaking countries as well. Many more organizations and\n\ngeographies are likely to be affected.\n\n\n-----\n\nGovernment\n\nScientific research centers\n\nMilitary\n\nTelecommunication providers\n\nFinance\n\n### 3. Have you notified victims?\n\nAs usual, Kaspersky Lab actively collaborates with industry\n\npartners, CERTs and law enforcement agencies to notify victims\n\nand help to mitigate the threat. We also rely on public awareness\n\nto spread information about it. If you need more information about\n\n[this actor, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com.](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n### 4. For how long have the attackers been active?\n\nForensic analysis indicates that the APT has been operational\n\nsince at least June 2011 and was still active in 2016. Although it\n\nappears to have largely ceased, there is a chance that it is still\n\nactive on computer systems that are not covered by Kaspersky\n\nLab solutions.\n\n### 5. Did the attackers use interesting or advanced techniques?\n\nThe attackers used multiple interesting and unusual techniques,\n\nincluding:\n\nData exfiltration and real­time status reporting using DNS\n\nrequests.\n\nImplant deployment using legitimate software update scripts.\n\nData exfiltration from air­gapped networks through the use of\n\nspecially prepared USB storage drives where the stolen data\n\nis stored in the area unused by standard tools of the\n\noperating system.\n\nUsing a modified LUA scripting engine to implement the core\n\nplatform and its plugins. The use of LUA components in\n\n[malware is very rare – it was previously spotted in the Flame](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/34344/the-flame-questions-and-answers-51/)\n\n[and Animal Farm attacks.](https://securelist.com/blog/research/69114/animals-in-the-apt-farm/)\n\n### 6. How did you discover this malware?\n\n\n-----\n\nPlatform discovered anomalous network traffic in a client\n\norganization’s network. Analysis of this incident led to the\n\ndiscovery of a strange executable program library loaded into the\n\nmemory of the domain controller server. The library was\n\nregistered as a Windows password filter and had access to\n\nsensitive data such as administrative passwords in cleartext.\n\nAdditional research revealed signs of activity of a previously\n\nunknown threat actor.\n\n### 7. How does ProjectSauron operate?\n\nProjectSauron usually registers its persistence module on domain\n\ncontrollers as a Windows LSA (Local Security Authority)\n\npassword filter. This feature is typically used by system\n\nadministrators to enforce password policies and validate new\n\npasswords to match specific requirements, such as length and\n\ncomplexity. This way, the ProjectSauron passive backdoor\n\nmodule starts every time any network or local user (including an\n\nadministrator) logs in or changes a password, and promptly\n\nharvests the password in plaintext.\n\nIn cases where domain controllers lack direct Internet access, the\n\nattackers install additional implants on other local servers which\n\nhave both local network and Internet access and may pass\n\nthrough significant amount of network traffic, i.e. proxy­servers,\n\nweb­servers, or software update servers. After that, these\n\nintermediary servers are used by ProjectSauron as internal proxy\n\nnodes for silent and inconspicuous data exfiltration, blending in\n\nwith high volumes of legitimate traffic.\n\nOnce installed, the main ProjectSauron modules start working as\n\n‘sleeper cells’, displaying no activity of their own and waiting for\n\n‘wake­up’ commands in the incoming network traffic. This method\n\nof operation ensures ProjectSauron’s extended persistence on\n\nthe servers of targeted organizations.\n\n### 8. What kind of implants does ProjectSauron use?\n\nMost of ProjectSauron’s core implants are designed to work as\n\nbackdoors, downloading new modules or running commands\n\nfrom the attacker purely in memory. The only way to capture\n\nthese modules is by making a full memory dump of the infected\n\n\n-----\n\ndifferent file names and sizes, and are individually built for each\n\ntarget. Each module’s timestamp, both in the file system and in its\n\nown headers, is tailored to the environment on which it is\n\ninstalled.\n\nSecondary ProjectSauron modules are designed to perform\n\nspecific functions like stealing documents, recording keystrokes,\n\nand stealing encryption keys from both infected computers and\n\nattached USB sticks.\n\nProjectSauron implements a modular architecture using its own\n\nvirtual file system to store additional modules (plugins) and a\n\nmodified LUA interpreter to execute internal scripts. There are\n\nupwards of 50 different plugin types.\n\n### 9. What is the initial infection vector?\n\nTo date, the initial infection vector used by ProjectSauron to\n\npenetrate victim networks remains unknown.\n\n### 10. How were the ProjectSauron implants deployed within the target network?\n\nIn several cases, ProjectSauron modules were deployed through\n\nthe modification of scripts used by system administrators to\n\ncentrally deploy legitimate software updates within the network.\n\nIn essence, the attackers injected a command to start the\n\nmalware by modifying existing software deployment scripts. The\n\ninjected malware is a tiny module that works as a simple\n\ndownloader.\n\nOnce started under a network administrator account, this small\n\ndownloader connects to a hard­coded internal or external IP\n\naddress and downloads the bigger ProjectSauron payload from\n\nthere.\n\nIn cases where the ProjectSauron persistence container is stored\n\non disk in EXE file format, it disguises the files with legitimate\n\nsoftware file names.\n\n\n-----\n\n### attackers use?\n\nThe ProjectSauron actor is extremely well prepared when it\n\ncomes to operational security. Running an expensive\n\ncyberespionage campaign like ProjectSauron requires vast\n\ndomain and server infrastructure uniquely assigned to each victim\n\norganization and never reused again. This makes traditional\n\nnetwork­based indicators of compromise almost useless because\n\nthey won’t be reused in any other organization.\n\nWe collected 28 domains linked to 11 IPs located in the United\n\nStates and several European countries that might be connected\n\nto ProjectSauron campaigns. Even the diversity of ISPs selected\n\nfor ProjectSauron operations makes it clear that the actor did\n\neverything possible to avoid creating patterns.\n\n### 12. Does ProjectSauron target isolated (air-gapped) networks?\n\nYes. We registered a few cases where ProjectSauron\n\nsuccessfully penetrated air­gapped networks.\n\nThe ProjectSauron toolkit contains a special module designed to\n\nmove data from air­gapped networks to Internet­connected\n\nsystems. To achieve this, removable USB devices are used.\n\nOnce networked systems are compromised, the attackers wait for\n\na USB drive to be attached to the infected machine.\n\nThese USBs are specially formatted to reduce the size of the\n\npartition on the USB disk, reserving an amount of hidden data\n\n(several hundred megabytes) at the end of the disk for malicious\n\npurposes. This reserved space is used to create a new custom­\n\nencrypted partition that won’t be recognized by a common OS,\n\nsuch as Windows. The partition has its own semi­filesystem (or\n\nvirtual file system, VFS) with two core directories: ‘In’ and ‘Out’.\n\nThis method also bypasses many DLP products, since software\n\nthat disables the plugging of unknown USB devices based on\n\nDeviceID wouldn’t prevent an attack or data leakage, because a\n\ngenuine recognized USB drive was used.\n\n### 13. Does ProjectSauron target critical\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the entities infected by ProjectSauron can be classified\n\nas critical infrastructure. However, we haven’t registered\n\nProjectSauron infections inside industrial control system networks\n\nthat have SCADA systems in place.\n\nAlso, we have not yet seen a ProjectSauron module targeting any\n\nspecific industrial hardware or software.\n\n### 14. Did ProjectSauron use any special communication methods?\n\nFor network communication, the ProjectSauron toolkit has\n\nextensive abilities, leveraging the stack of the most commonly\n\nused protocols: ICMP, UDP, TCP, DNS, SMTP and HTTP.\n\nOne of the ProjectSauron plugins is the DNS data exfiltration tool.\n\nTo avoid generic detection of DNS tunnels at network level, the\n\nattackers use it in low­bandwidth mode, which is why it is used\n\nsolely to exfiltrate target system metadata.\n\nAnother interesting feature in ProjectSauron malware that\n\nleverages the DNS protocol is the real­time reporting of the\n\noperation progress to a remote server. Once an operational\n\nmilestone is achieved, ProjectSauron issues a DNS­request to a\n\nspecial subdomain unique to each target.\n\n### 15. What is the most sophisticated feature of the ProjectSauron APT?\n\nIn general, the ProjectSauron platform is very advanced and\n\n[reaches the level of complexity of Regin, Equation and similar](https://securelist.com/blog/research/67741/regin-nation-state-ownage-of-gsm-networks/)\n\nthreat actors we have reported on in the past. Some of the most\n\ninteresting things in the ProjectSauron platform include:\n\nMultiple exfiltration mechanisms, including piggybacking on\n\nknown protocols.\n\nBypassing air­gaps using hidden data partitions on USB\n\nsticks.\n\nHijacking Windows LSA to control network domain servers.\n\nImplementing an extended LUA engine to write custom\n\nmalicious scripts to control the entire malware platform with a\n\n\n-----\n\n### 16. Are the attackers using any zero-day vulnerabilities?\n\nTo date we have not found any 0­day exploits associated with\n\nProjectSauron.\n\nHowever, when penetrating isolated systems, the creation of the\n\nencrypted storage area in the USB does not in itself enable\n\nattackers to get control of the air­gapped machines. There has to\n\nbe another component such as a 0 day exploit placed on the main\n\npartition of the USB drive.\n\nSo far we have not found any 0­day exploit embedded in the body\n\nof the malware we analyzed, and we believe it was probably\n\ndeployed in rare, hard­to­catch instances.\n\n### 17. Is this a Windows-only threat? What versions of Windows are targeted?\n\nProjectSauron works on all modern Microsoft Windows operating\n\nsystems – both x64 and x86. We have witnessed infections\n\nrunning on Windows XP x86 as well as Windows 2012 R2 Server\n\nEdition x64.\n\nTo date, we haven’t found a non­Windows version of\n\nProjectSauron.\n\n### 18. Were the attackers hunting for specific information?\n\nProjectSauron actively searches for information related to rather\n\nuncommon, custom network encryption software. This client­\n\nserver software is widely adopted by many of the target\n\norganizations to secure communications, voice, email, and\n\ndocument exchange.\n\nIn a number of the cases we analyzed, ProjectSauron deployed\n\nmalicious modules inside the custom network encryption’s\n\nsoftware directory, disguised under similar filenames and\n\naccessing the data placed beside its own executable. Some of\n\nextracted LUA scripts show that the attackers have a high interest\n\n\n-----\n\nnodes.\n\nAlso, one of the embedded ProjectSauron configurations contains\n\na special unique identifier for the targeted network encryption\n\nsoftware’s server within its virtual network. The behavior of the\n\ncomponent that searches for the server IP address is unusual.\n\nAfter getting the IP, the ProjectSauron component tries to\n\ncommunicate with the remote server using its own\n\n(ProjectSauron) protocol as if it was yet another C&C server. This\n\nsuggests that some communication servers running the\n\nmentioned network encryption software could also be infected\n\nwith ProjectSauron.\n\n### 19. What exactly is being stolen from the targeted machines?\n\nThe ProjectSauron modules we found are able to steal\n\ndocuments, record keystrokes and steal encryption keys from\n\ninfected computers and attached USB sticks.\n\nThe fragment of configuration block below, extracted from\n\nProjectSauron, shows the kind of information and file extensions\n\nthe attackers were looking for:\n\n\n.*account.*|.*acct.*|.*domain.*|.*login.*|.*member.*|.*user.*|.*na\n\nme|.*email|.*_id|id|uid|mn|mailaddress|.*nick.*|alias|codice|uin|\n\nsign­\n\nin|strCodUtente|.*pass.*|.*pw|pw.*|additional_info|.*secret.*|.*s\n\negreto.*\n\n[^\\$]$\n\n^.*\\.(doc|xls|pdf)$\n\n\n*.txt;*.doc;*.docx;*.ppt;*.pptx;*.xls;*.xlsx;*.vsd;*.wab;*.pdf;*.dst;\n\n*.ppk;*.rsa;*.rar;*.one;*.rtf;~WPL*.tmp;*.FTS;*.rpt;*.conf;*.cfg;*.\n\npk2;*.nct;*.key;*.psw\n\n\nInterestingly, while most of the words and extensions above are in\n\nthe English language several of them point to Italian such as:\n\n\n-----\n\nKeywords / filenames targeted by ProjectSauron data theft\n\nmodules:\n\n**Italian keyword** **Translation**\n\nCodice code\n\nCodUtente Usercode\n\nSegreto Secret\n\nThis suggests the attackers had prepared to attack Italian­\n\nspeaking targets as well. However, we are not aware of any\n\nItalian victims of ProjectSauron at the moment.\n\n### 20. Have you observed any artifacts indicating who is behind the ProjectSauron APT?\n\nAttribution is hard and reliable attribution is rarely possible in\n\ncyberspace. Even with confidence in various indicators and\n\napparent attacker mistakes, there is a greater likelihood that\n\nthese are smoke and mirrors created by an attacker with a\n\ngreater vantage point and vast resources. When dealing with the\n\nmost advanced threat actors, as is the case with ProjectSauron,\n\nattribution becomes an unsolvable problem.\n\n### 21. Is this a nation-state sponsored attack?\n\nWe think an operation of such complexity, aimed at stealing\n\nconfidential and secret information, can only be executed with\n\nsupport from a nation­state.\n\n### 22. What would ProjectSauron have cost to set up and run?\n\nKaspersky Lab has no exact data on this, but estimates that the\n\ndevelopment and operation of ProjectSauron is likely to have\n\nrequired several specialist teams and a budget probably running\n\ninto millions of dollars.\n\n\n-----\n\n### platform compare to other top-level threat actors?\n\nThe actor behind ProjectSauron is very advanced, comparable\n\nonly to the top­of­the­top in terms of sophistication: alongside\n\n[Duqu, Flame, Equation, and Regin. Whether related or unrelated](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/32668/the-mystery-of-duqu-part-ten-18/)\n\nto these advanced actors, the ProjectSauron attackers have\n\ndefinitely learned from them.\n\nAs a reminder, here are some features of other APT attackers\n\nwhich we discovered that the ProjectSauron attackers had\n\ncarefully learned from or emulated:\n\nDuqu:\n\nUse of intranet C&Cs (where compromised target servers\n\nmay act as independent C&Cs)\n\nRunning only in memory (persistence on a few gateway hosts\n\nonly)\n\nUse of different encryption methods per victim\n\nUse of named pipes for LAN communication\n\nMalware distribution through legitimate software deployment\n\nchannels\n\nFlame:\n\nLUA­embedded code\n\nSecure file deletion (through data wiping)\n\nAttacking air­gapped systems via removable devices\n\nEquation and Regin:\n\nUsage of RC5/RC6 encryption\n\nVirtual Filesystems (VFS)\n\nAttacking air­gapped systems via removable devices\n\nHidden data storage on removable devices\n\nThese other actors also showed what made them vulnerable to\n\npotential exposure, and ProjectSauron did its best to address\n\nthese issues:\n\nVulnerable or persistent C&C locations\n\nISP name, IP, domain, and tools reuse across different\n\ncampaigns\n\n\n-----\n\nForensic footprint on disk\n\nTimestamps in various components\n\nLarge volumes of exfiltrated data, alarming unknown\n\nprotocols or message formats\n\nIn addition, it appears that the attackers took special care with\n\nwhat we consider as indicators of compromise and implemented\n\na unique pattern for each and every target they attacked, so that\n\nthe same indicators would have little value for anyone else. This\n\nis a summary of the ProjectSauron strategy as we see it. The\n\nattackers clearly understand that we as researchers are always\n\nlooking for patterns. Remove the patterns and the operation will\n\nbe harder to discover. We are aware of more than 30\n\norganizations attacked, but we are sure that this is just a tiny tip\n\nof the iceberg.\n\n### 24. Do Kaspersky Lab products detect all variants of this malware?\n\nAll Kaspersky Lab products detect ProjectSauron samples as\n\nHEUR:Trojan.Multi.Remsec.gen\n\n### 25. Are there Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to help victims identify the intrusion?\n\nProjectSauron’s tactics are designed to avoid creating patterns.\n\nImplants and infrastructure are customized for each individual\n\ntarget and never re­used – so the standard security approach of\n\npublishing and checking for the same basic indicators of\n\ncompromise (IOC) is of little use.\n\nHowever, structural code similarities are inevitable, especially for\n\nnon­compressed and non­encrypted code. This opens up the\n\npossibility of recognizing known code in some cases.\n\nThat’s why, alongside the formal IOCs, we have added relevant\n\nYARA rules. While the IOCs have been listed mainly to give\n\nexamples of what they look like, the YARA rules are likely to be of\n\ngreater use and could detect real traces of ProjectSauron.\n\nFor background: YARA is a tool for uncovering malicious files or\n\ntt f i i ti it t t k th t h\n\n\n-----\n\nto find, group, and categorize related malware samples and draw\n\nconnections between them in order to build malware families and\n\nuncover groups of attacks that might otherwise go unnoticed.\n\nWe have prepared our YARA rules based on tiny similarities and\n\noddities that stood out in the attackers’ techniques. These rules\n\ncan be used to scan networks and systems for the same patterns\n\nof code. If some of these oddities appear during such a scan,\n\nthere is a chance that the organizations has been hit by the same\n\nactor.\n\nMore information about ProjectSauron is available to customers\n\nof Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting Service.
