    "plain_text": "# Win32/Spy.Ranbyus modifying Java code in RBS Ukraine systems\n\n**[welivesecurity.com/2012/12/19/win32spy-ranbyus-modifying-java-code-in-rbs/](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2012/12/19/win32spy-ranbyus-modifying-java-code-in-rbs/)**\n\nDecember 19, 2012\n\nWin32/Spy.Ranbyus shows how it is possible to bypass payment transaction\nsigning/authentication with smartcard devices and has started to modify java code in one of\nthe most popular remote banking systems (RBS) in the Ukraine.\n\n19 Dec 2012 - 09:37AM\n\nWin32/Spy.Ranbyus shows how it is possible to bypass payment transaction\nsigning/authentication with smartcard devices and has started to modify java code in one of\nthe most popular remote banking systems (RBS) in the Ukraine.\n\nI’ve already mentioned the Win32/Spy.Ranbyus family in my previous blog post about\nsmartcard monitoring in modern banking malware (Smartcard vulnerabilities in modern\nbanking malware). It displays really interesting functionality because it shows how it is\npossible to bypass payment transaction signing/authentication with smartcard devices. We\nhave been tracking the latest modification to this malware family and the trojan Ranbyus\n\n\n-----\n\nhas started to modify java code in one of the most popular remote banking systems (RBS)\nin the Ukraine, BIFIT’s iBank 2. [ESET Virus Radar statistics show that Ukraine is the region](http://www.virusradar.com/en/Win32_Spy.Ranbyus/detail)\n\nmost affected ever by Ranbyus infection.\n\nThis banking trojan doesn’t have webinjection functionality and instead implements\na targeted attack on specific banking/payment\nsoftware. Win32/Spy.Ranbyus collects\ninformation about the infected system (active\nprocesses, OS version and so on) and\nforwards it to its command center. The main functionality for stealing money is based on a\nset of various form grabbers for specific payment software. For example, grabbers for\nsoftware developed for the java platform look like this:\n\nI’ve already disclosed information about java patching functionality in another banking\n[malware family, Carberp (Carberp Gang Evolution: CARO 2012 presentation). Carberp has](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2012/05/24/carberp-gang-evolution-at-caro-2012)\nspecific functionality for modifying the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and tracking payment\nsoftware activity. And Ranbyus is based on a different method, modifying java code only for\nspecific application without changing the JVM. For example, Ranbyus can modify the\nbalance figures so as to hide information about fake transactions implemented through the\nmalware.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Tracked java methods used by Win32/Spy.Ranbyus]\n\nIn addition, Win32/Spy.Ranbyus can block RBS software activity and show the following\nmessage in the Russian language:\n\nTranslated from the Russian the message\nlooks like this:\n\n“Technical work is being performed on the\n_server, and the service may be temporarily_\n_unavailable. We apologize for the_\n_inconvenience”._\n\nRanbyus targets Ukrainian and Russian banks and is never seen in campaigns targeting\nother regions. The command center panel for the Win32/Spy.Ranbyus botnet looks like\nthis:\n\nThe Carberp gang is the (crime) market leader in the Russian region and has already\nsecured a safe position in the top 20 most active threats in Russia for a full year (Carberp,\nthe renaissance). Ranbyus has the leading position among banking malware in the\nUkrainian region.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe SHA1 hash for the Win32/Spy.Ranbyus.I dropper mentioned here is:\nee6c14f26962447a30823f9f8d20a53d29322617\n\n_Special thanks to my colleagues Anton Cherepanov and Dmitry Volkov (Group-IB)._\n\n**Aleksandr Matrosov, Security Intelligence Team Lead**\n\n19 Dec 2012 - 09:37AM\n\n## Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
