Share sensitive**\ninformation only on official, secure websites.\n\n[CISA.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/) [Services](https://www.us-cert.gov/services) [Report](https://www.us-cert.gov/report)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), part of the\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), is aware of a global Domain Name\nSystem (DNS) infrastructure hijacking campaign. Using compromised credentials, an\nattacker can modify the location to which an organization’s domain name resources resolve.\nThis enables the attacker to redirect user traffic to attacker-controlled infrastructure and\nobtain valid encryption certificates for an organization’s domain names, enabling man-in-themiddle attacks.\n\nSee the following links for downloadable copies of open-source indicators of\ncompromise (IOCs) from the sources listed in the References section below:\n\n[IOCs (.csv)](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA19-024A_IOCs.csv)\n[IOCs (.stix)](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA19-024A_IOCs.stix.xml)\n\n\n-----\n\nNote: these files were last updated February 13, 2019, to remove the following three nonmalicious IP addresses:\n\n107.161.23.204\n192.161.187.200\n209.141.38.71\n\n## Technical Details\n\nUsing the following techniques, attackers have redirected and intercepted web and mail\ntraffic, and could do so for other networked services.\n\n1. The attacker begins by compromising user credentials, or obtaining them through\n\nalternate means, of an account that can make changes to DNS records.\n2. Next, the attacker alters DNS records, like Address (A), Mail Exchanger (MX), or Name\n\nServer (NS) records, replacing the legitimate address of a service with an address the\nattacker controls. This enables them to direct user traffic to their own infrastructure for\nmanipulation or inspection before passing it on to the legitimate service, should they\nchoose. This creates a risk that persists beyond the period of traffic redirection.\n3. Because the attacker can set DNS record values, they can also obtain valid encryption\n\ncertificates for an organization’s domain names. This allows the redirected traffic to be\ndecrypted, exposing any user-submitted data. Since the certificate is valid for the\ndomain, end users receive no error warnings.\n\n## Mitigations\n\nNCCIC recommends the following best practices to help safeguard networks against this\nthreat:\n\nUpdate the passwords for all accounts that can change organizations’ DNS records.\nImplement multifactor authentication on domain registrar accounts, or on other systems\nused to modify DNS records.\nAudit public DNS records to verify they are resolving to the intended location.\nSearch for encryption certificates related to domains and revoke any fraudulently\nrequested certificates.\n\n## References\n\n Revisions\n\nJanuary 24, 2019: Initial version\n\nFebruary 6, 2019: Updated IOCs, added Crowdstrike blog\n\nFebruary 13, 2019: Updated IOCs\n\n\n-----\n\n[This product is provided subject to this Notification and this](https://www.us-cert.gov/privacy/notification) [Privacy & Use policy.](https://www.dhs.gov/privacy-policy)\n\n**Please share your thoughts.**\n\n[We recently updated our anonymous product survey; we'd welcome your feedback.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/AA19-024A)\n\n\n-----",
