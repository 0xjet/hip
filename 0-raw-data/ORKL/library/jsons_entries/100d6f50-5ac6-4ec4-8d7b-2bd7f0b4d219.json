These six men, per the indictment,\nwere involved in a number of high-profile cyberattacks, with targets including French\nPresident Emmanuel Macron’s election campaign, the Winter Olympics, Ukrainian energy\ninfrastructure, the UN’s chemical watchdog (OPCW), and others.\n\n_Image courtesy of_ _[US Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328521/download)_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2018, the Netherlands and United Kingdom issued a similar cache of information about a\nnumber of GRU hackers involved some of the same cyberattacks. In both this week’s and\nthe [2018 disclosure of the identities of GRU hackers, the incompetence of the Russian state](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2018/10/04/305-car-registrations-may-point-massive-gru-security-breach/)\nand its information security becomes quite clear: many of these secretive hackers have\nregistered their vehicles to their workplace in Moscow, that is to say to the publicly accessible\naddress of GRU military units. By running simple queries in widely available leaked\ndatabases showing Moscow Oblast vehicle registration data, we can easily discover the\nidentities of dozens of additional hackers who registered their vehicles to the same nonexistent Moscow address.\n\n**Indicted Hackers at Svobody**\n\nWhen searching the names of three of the six indicted hackers, we found that they have all\nregistered their vehicles to the same address: Svobody 21В [referring the the Russian “в”,\n_the third letter of the alphabet, not the English “b”]. It is important to note that none of these_\nhackers actually live at this address — which would make it a very crowded communal\napartment. Rather they simply used their workplace as a vehicle registration address, as is\ndone by many Russians serving in the military. In this case, the GRU’s military unit 74455\noperates out of the address Svobody 21.\n\nThe biographical information in this leaked vehicle registration database matches the\ninformation in the FBI warrants for [Pavel Frolov,](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/pavel-valeryevich-frolov) [Pyotr Pliskin and](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/petr-nikolayevich-pliskin) [Anatoly Kovalev, except](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/anatoliy-sergeyevich-kovalev/@@download.pdf)\nfor the FBI noting Pliskin’s date of birth as August 6, instead of August 26. This indicates\neither an error on the FBI’s part, or a typo in the leaked database.\n\n[Kovalev was previously indicted in 2018 along with 11 other GRU hackers linked to the same](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/grand-jury-indicts-12-russian-intelligence-officers-hacking-offenses-related-2016-election)\nmilitary unit 74455.\n\n[As detailed by The Insider, the vehicle of another of the six indicted hackers, Yuri Andrienko,](https://theins.ru/politika/236113)\n[is registered to a different known GRU address — Khoroshevskoe 76B.](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2018/09/23/yeah-it-s-the-gru-hq-so-what)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Personal details via leaked Moscow Oblast GIBDD database, Photos via FBI/Justice Department press_\n\n_release. Image remixed by Bellingcat Investigation Team_\n\n**A Hacker Registry**\n\nConducting a wider search by an address on the same leaked Moscow vehicle registration\ndatabase returns dozens of other people — all born between 1978 and 1998 — who\n[registered their vehicles to the same Svobody 21 address.
