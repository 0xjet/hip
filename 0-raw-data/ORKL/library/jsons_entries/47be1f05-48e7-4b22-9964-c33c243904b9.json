    "plain_text": "# Latest Elise APT comes packed with Sandbox Evasions\n\n**joesecurity.org/blog/8409877569366580427**\n\nRecently we came across an interesting sample which seems to be related to Elise Malware.\nElise is tight to the Dragon Fish and Lotus Blossom APT groups which primary targets\ngovernments and defense contractors. Elise is known to infect victims by using the latest\nexploits available and is often packed with interesting Sandbox evasion techniques.\n\nIn this blog post, we will dissect the latest version of Elise.\n\nThe sample under investigation is distributed as an Office document lure. To be more precise\nin Rich Text Format.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## CVE-2018-0802\n\nWe start the analysis by having a look at the behavior graph and acknowledge that the\nprocess EQNEDT32.EXE was started among Winword.exe:\n\nThis process is the Microsoft Office Equation Editor. In November 2017 the security company\n[Embedi detected an exploit in EQNEDT32.EXE which later got the identification CVE-2017-](https://embedi.com/blog/skeleton-closet-ms-office-vulnerability-you-didnt-know-about/)\n11882. Microsoft patched the flaw in November.\n\nSo, is Elise using this exploit? To answer this question we had a detailed look at the exploit\n[itself. The outcome: no it is not CVE-2017-11882 but rather CVE-2018-0802. CVE-2018-](https://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0802)\n0802? This a second exploit also included in EQNEDT32.EXE which was detected in later\nDecember.\n\nWe extracted the trampoline and shellcode:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe code renames and loads the PE file (named a.b) previously dropped by Word. The\nnewly loaded code is then injected into IExplorer.exe where the main payload is executed:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Sandbox Evasions\n\nElise performs a variety of sandbox checks in In IExplorer:\n\nVMware backdoor check\n\n\n-----\n\nDisk Name Check\n\n\n-----\n\nCheck for various Analysis Tools\n\n\n-----\n\nProcess Check\n\n\n-----\n\nMac Address Check\n\n## Payloads\n\nAfter passing all the sandbox checks Elise creates an autostart key:\n\n\n-----\n\nThanks to [Hybrid Code Analysis we can also detect all malicious functionalities:](https://www.joesecurity.org/joe-sandbox-technology#hca)\n\nAdd a Proxy to Internet Explorer\n\n\n-----\n\nAdd a Proxy to Firefox\n\nFinally, in function 514D05, 5159AF and 515486 we find the download, upload and\ncommand execution handlers. Elise can collect and upload the following data:\n\nCPU Usage\nRam (size/free)\nDisk space (size/free)\nWindows Version\nUsername\n\n\n-----\n\nLocale\nTimezone\nSID\nList of tasks\nList of network adapters\nList of files on Desktop\n\n## Final Words\n\nElise is a very advanced piece of malware using for its distribution only the latest exploits.\nBefore the main payload is executed many different Sandbox evasions are performed. The\npayload and the communication code is injected into IExplorer likely bypassing PFW and\nHIPS.\n\nInterested in trying out [Joe Sandbox?
