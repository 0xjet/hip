Paste.ee is\na free pastebin where users can submit and upload pastes as a plain text. The initial\n**[vector information which was found on Twitter is a vbs](https://twitter.com/neonprimetime/status/1365351048525791232/photo/2)** **zipped file named “Lease**\nAgreement.zip” and the password to open the file is mentioned as “tomorrow’s date” which\ncan be seen in the screenshot below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n1: Initial vector taken from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/neonprimetime/status/1365351048525791232/photo/2)\nThe first submission of the zipped file in VirusTotal being 19/02/2021 (DD/MM/YYYY) and\non giving the password with the next day’s date which is 20/02/2021 (DD/MM/YYYY) as\nmentioned in the phishing email unzips the file, as shown in Figure 2 .\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2:\n\nPassword for unzipping the file\n\nFigure 3: Unzipped file\nThe “Lease Agreement.vbs” script file uses “WScript.ScriptFullName” to return the full path\nto the script currently being executed, with which the vbscript copies the existing file to a\nnew file named D.vbs in the startup folder.\n\nFigure 4 : Copies itself to Startup folder\nOn execution it connects to paste.ee from where the next stage of malware will be\ndownloaded.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Connection to paste.ee site\nThe copied D.vbs script and the contained base64 encoded data is executed with the help\nof powershell.\n\nFigure 6: D.vbs executed with powershell\n\nFigure 7: Base64 encoded data executed with PowerShell\nThe encoded base64 data contains the url from which the njRAT is going to be\ndownloaded. To complicate identifying the url, the url is reversed, so that users cannot find\nthe url at first sight. The ones that look like airplanes in the encoded base64 data as\nshown in Figure 7 and Figure 8 are simple string replacement for string ‘A’ which can be\nseen in Figure 8. This base64 encoded data found in Figure 7 and Figure 8 is the reverse\nof the exact base64 encoded data found in the url “hxxps[:]//paste[.]ee/bsKo9/0”.\n\nFigure 8: URL from which njRAT is going to be downloaded\nThe reversed url’s base64 encoded data can be seen in Figure 9.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: Base64 encoded data of hxxps[:]//paste[.]ee/r/bsKo9/0\nThe encoded base64 part on decoding was found to be the njRAT PE file.\n\nFigure 10: Decoded base64 data is the njRAT executable\nThe obtained decoded PE file which is a njRAT executable is a .NET file named juju.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: njRAT juju.exe file\nOnce the njRAT is downloaded and run, it tries to connect with xxxcarldon.duckdns.org.\nThe contacted ip address 192.169.69.26 has been blacklisted by several trusted IP lookups.\n\nFigure 12: Strings showing the\n\ndomain xxxcarldon.duckdns.org\n\n\n-----\n\nnjRAT also known as **Bladabindi or** **njw0rm is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) created**\ninitially by the members of an underground community named Sparclyheason and this\nnjRAT has been used in carrying out campaigns against the Middle East in the past.\n\nnjRAT is capable of remotely controlling systems, spying on the victim’s system and\ncollecting all possible sensitive data like usernames, passwords. Everything happens\nsilently in the background and the user never knows that they are being spied.\n\nThis .NET juju.exe RAT on debugging has been found to have several features. Few of the\nfeatures can be seen in the screenshots below\n\nThe usual keylogging feature of the njRAT can be seen in Figure 13 and Figure 14.\n\nFigure 13: Keylogging features\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14:\n\nAdditional Keylogging features\nThis RAT does registry modifications like DeleteValueFromRegistry,\nGetValueFromRegistry, SaveValueOnRegistry silently without the user’s knowledge.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15: Registry Modifications\nVictims’ details such as the victim’s name, user name, OS name, OS version are collected\nwithout their knowledge.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16: Collected victim’s details\nOne major feature of this RAT is activating the webcam whose code can be seen from the\nscreenshot below. It searches for a webcam and if it is not found,\n**GetForegroundWindowTitle API,retrieves the currently working window from which the**\nvictim can be spied on.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17: Collected OS Name, OS Version and Webcam details\nSelf-delete feature of this RAT deletes applications according to the hacker’s need and this\ncan be seen in the screenshot below.\n\nFigure 18: Self-delete feature\nThreat actors who have been seen using this njRAT in the past are Aggah, RATicate,\nOperation Commando, RevengeHotels, Sphinx, China Based APT 41, RedAlpha, Pakistan\nbased Gorgon group, Transparent Tribe, Iran based Group5, Gaza based Molerats, Syria\n\n\n-----\n\nbased Goldmouse and Pat Bear.\n\nAll of these APT groups’ main intention is to perform information theft and espionage\nactivities.\n\nOut of all these threat actors, Aggah specifically has been seen using paste.ee to host\nnjRAT, NetWire RAT, RevengeRAT, Agent Tesla. Other malware like vjw0rm,\nSmokeLoader, Azorult, AsyncRAt have been seen hosted on paste.ee sites in the past by\nother threat actors.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThreat actors, of late, have started favouring paste sites to host their malware as they\nsupport only plain text files, which helps the threat actors to easily evade detection from AV\nvendors. Moreover, if the malware is encoded as a text and hosted on sites like paste.ee,\nthreat actors know that these sites being legitimate cannot be taken down that easily.\n\nWe at K7 Labs keep monitoring such malware procatively, even if it is hosted on legitimate\nsites and add detection at the earliest for the same to keep our users protected. Users are\nadvised to install and use a reputable security product like K7 Total Security and keep it\nupdated to stay safe from the latest threats.\n\n## Indicators Of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n**MD5** **File Name** **K7 Detection**\n**Name**\n\n\n3FF8E653F245FBFA137BB714F096ADF8 Lease\nAgreement.vbs\n\n\nTrojan ( 0001140e1\n)\n\n\n036AD2F24390FD4A7654A922E05D0295 juju.exe Trojan ( 700000121\n)\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK\n\n**Tactics** **Techniques**\n\nExecution PowerShell\n\nScripting\n\nPersistence Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder\n\nDefensive Evasion Scripting\n\n\n-----",
