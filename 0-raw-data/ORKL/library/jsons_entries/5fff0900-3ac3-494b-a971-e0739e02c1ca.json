Redbanc\n\n\n-----\n\nconfirmed that the malware was installed on the company s corporate network without\ntriggering antivirus detection, however the threat has since been mitigated and did not impact\ncompany operations, services, or infrastructure.\n\nThis intrusion represents the latest known example of Lazarus-affiliated tools being deployed\nwithin financially motivated activity targeted toward financial institutions in Latin America.\n\n## Chilean Redbanc Intrusion: Reported Initial Attack Vector\n\nAccording to recent reporting, the intrusion occurred due to malware delivered via a trusted\nRedbanc IT professional who clicked to apply to a job opening found through social media.\nThe individual who appeared to have posted the open position then contacted the applicant\nfrom Redbanc to arrange a brief interview, which occurred shortly thereafter in Spanish via\nSkype. Having never expressed any doubts about the legitimacy of the open position,\napplication, or interview process, the applicant was ultimately and unwittingly tricked into\nexecuting the payload.\n\n## Referenced Sample Leads to North-Koream Lazarus “PowerRatankba”\n\nIn the publicly referenced samples attributed to the Redbanc intrusion, Flashpoint analysts\nidentified the dropper sample as being related to the Lazarus malware PowerRatankba. The\ndropper is a Microsoft Visual C#/ Basic .NET (v4.0.30319)-compiled executable that contains\nthe logic to call the server and download a PowerRatankba PowerShell reconnaissance tool.\nThe malware timestamp displays the possible compilation time of Wednesday, October 31,\n2018, 00:07:53 UTC with the program database as\nF:.GenereatePDF\\CardOffer\\salary\\salary\\obj\\Release\\ApplicationPDF.pdb.\n\nThe dropper displays a fake job application form while downloading and executing\nPowerRatankba. The payload was not available from the server during the time of the\nanalysis but was recovered from the sandbox at the time of analysis. This allowed analysts\nto create a likely scenario of how the malware chain worked.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Image 1: The dropper malware is disguised as a legitimate software for job_**\n**_applications._**\n\nThe malware functions responsible for execution are contained within the ThreadProc and\nSendUrl functions, processing Base64-encoded parameters and executing the\nPowerRatankba code.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Image 2: ThreadProc decodes the Base64-encoded values and executes the_**\n**_PowerShell script._**\n\nThe dropper decodes the Base64-encoded parameters, calls the server at\nhxxps://ecombox[.]store/tbl_add[.]php and executes the PowerShell code saved in\nC:\\users\\public\\REG_TIME.ps1 via a hidden Window, sleeping for 5,000 milliseconds before\ndeleting the saved PowerShell script.\n\n## PowerRatankba In-Depth\n\nThe malware chain leverages another PowerShell decoder script to recreate the\nPowerRatankba PowerShell code via “crypt_do” function leveraging Base64, Rijndael with\nSHA256. The passed password is “PowershellAgent.”\n\n**_Image 3: The malware leverages the intermediary PowerShell decoder to obtain the_**\n**_PowerRatankba._**\n\n[According to researchers at Proofpoint, PowerRatankba is a newer reconnaissance and](http://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/north-korea-bitten-bitcoin-bug-financially-motivated-campaigns-reveal-new)\ndownloader implant tool leveraged by Lazarus to fingerprint and obtain information about\ncompromised machines. The URI structure and the malware resemble the one described as\n\n\n-----\n\nPowerRatankba.B by Proofpoint, as they have the same DES encryption algorithm\namongst other code template similarities. One difference for this PowerRatankba variant is it\ncommunicates to the server on HTTPS. Notably, the malware template contains the\ncommented out base server hxxps://bodyshoppechiropractic[.]com.\n\n**_Image 4: The PowerRatankba template includes the main installation variables and_**\n**_setup._**\n\nThe main available actions are as follows:\n```\naction=\"What\"\naction=\"cmd\"\naction=\"CmdRes\"\naction=\"BaseInfo\"\n\n```\nThe malware leverages Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to obtain the victim IP\nby parsing Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration for the IP and MAC address. It is notable\nthat for the victim ID, the malware leverages the MAC address with Base64-encoding, which\nis passed to action=”What” and encoded one more time via the Base64 algorithm.\n\nPowerRatankba queries the system information for the following details, heavily using WMI\nfor Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration and Win32_OperatingSystem. Additionally, the\nmalware retrieves the logged-in user via $env:USERNAME, the process list via tasklist,\nobtains proxy settings via registry queries, and checks for open file shares (RPC 139, SMB\n445) and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP; 3389) ports, writing to a log if “Open” or “Closed\nor filtered.”\n\nThe full collection of items is performed via the following code excerpt:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nwmi Get WmiObject Computer $private:computer Class\nWin32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\nIP\n$loggedUser = $env:USERNAME\nif ($private:wmi = Get-WmiObject -Computer $private:computer -Class\nWin32_OperatingSystem -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)\n$data.'OS Architecture' = $private:wmi.OSArchitecture\n$data.'OS Boot Time' = $private:wmi.ConvertToDateTime($private:wmi.LastBootUpTime)\n$data.'OS Language   ' = $private:wmi.OSLanguage\n$data.'OS Version' = $private:wmi.Version\n$data.'OS Name' = $private:wmi.Caption\n$data.'OS Install Date' = $private:wmi.ConvertToDateTime($private:wmi.InstallDate)\n$data.'OS Service Pack' = [string]$private:wmi.ServicePackMajorVersion\n$private:wmi.ServicePackMinorVersion\n$ports =\n'File shares/RPC' = '139'\n'File shares' = '445'\n'RDP' = '3389'\n$data.\"Port $($ports.$service) ($service)\" = 'Open'\n$private:socket.Close()\n$data.\"Port $($ports.$service) ($service)\" = 'Closed or filtered'\n$private:socket = $null\n$reg2 = [Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey]::OpenRemoteBaseKey('CurrentUser',\n$env:COMPUTERNAME)\n$regkey2 = $reg2.OpenSubkey(\"SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet\nSettings\")\n$data.'ProxyEnable' = $regkey2.GetValue('ProxyEnable')\n$data.'ProxySetting' = $regkey2.GetValue('ProxyServer')\n$global:PROXY_ENABLE = $data.'ProxyEnable'\n$global:PROXY_SERVER = $data.'ProxySetting'\n$outp = \"HOST:\"\n $comName\n \"USER:\"\n $loggedUser\n$outp\n= $data.GetEnumerator()\n Sort-Object 'Name'\n Format-Table -AutoSize\n Out-String\n$outp\n $process_list\n\n```\nThe malware checks if it has administrator privileges querying for security identifier (SID) “S1-5-32-544” and “Enabled group” via whoami /groups, which is a built-in Administrators\ngroup.\n\nIf it has admin privileges, the PowerRatankba attempts to download the next stage from\nhxxps://ecombox[.]store/tbl_add[.]php as “c:\\windows\\temp\\REG_WINDEF.ps1 and register it\nas a service through the “sc create” command as “AutoProtect,” with the “cmd.exe\n/powershell” command having the “start=Auto” parameter.\n\nThe relevant code is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n$ret Test Path Path $schedulePath\n$cmdSchedule = 'sc create '\n $nr_task\n ' binPath= \"cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -ep bypass -windowstyle hidden -file '\n$schedulePath\n'\" start= Auto'\n\n```\nPowerRatankba sets up an autostart in \\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start\nMenu\\Programs\\Startup\\ as WIN_REG.exe.\n\nThe malware leverages DES encryption with DES using “PowerShl” as both the key and\ninitialization vector (IV) in Ascii {80 119 114 83 104 101 108 108} and then encodes in\nBase64.\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\ndagent Delete agent (‘taskkill /f /pid’, ‘sc schtasks /delete /tn’)\n\nexagent Modify and replace ps1 and VBS files\n\nragent Send data to the server, download executable to\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\tmp, and run it via PowerShell\n\nkagent Kill\n\ndelay Delay execution\n\npanel Parse panel commands (“sdel” and “run”)\n\nThe discovered PowerRatankba malware contains helpful “ConsoleLog” output logic\ndesigned to debug the application, which is meant to aid the developer to survey the output.\nThe output is stored in the hardcoded c:\\windows\\temp\\tmp0914.tmp location.\n\nThe malware outputs the following messages during its execution:\n```\n\"Start to get base info\"\n\"Generating UDID\"\n“Generated udid”\n\"Finish to get base info\"\n\"Check if it is admin\"\n\"Register to Service\"\n\"Register to Start up\"\n\"Sending Baseinfo to server\"\n\"Try again to send baseinfo\"\n\"Start waiting command\"\n\n## Mitigations & Recommendations\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nResearchers believe Lazarus (also known as Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, and\n“Kimsuky”) to be an APT group comprising operators from “Bureau 121” (121국), the cyber\nwarfare division of North Korea’s RGB. The group has been active since at least 2009 and is\npresumed to operate out of a multitude of international locations. Lazarus appears to have\nbeen interested in a variety of sectors and targets in the last eighteen months, but it\ncontinues to be one of the most formidable APT groups targeting and exploiting financial\ninstitutions. The group has reportedly been involved in a string of bank intrusions impacting\ninstitutions all over the world, heavily targeting Latin American financial institutions and\ncryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nMonitoring and reviewing the incidents related to Lazarus and dissecting the group’s attacks\nand toolkits across the ATT&CK framework may assist with mitigating the exposure to this\nthreat. Additionally, Lazarus attacks appear to reportedly rely on social media and trusted\nrelationships, which may elevate their abilities to execute and install their payloads. As such,\nsecurity awareness training—especially that which pertains to social media and social\nengineering—is also recommended.\n\n## Attachments & Downloads\n\nTo download the indicators of compromise (IOCs) for the Redbanc PowerRatankba\nincident, **[click here for the CSV file and](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-01-14.lazarus.csv)** **[here for the MISP JSON file mapped to ATT&CK](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-01-14_lazarus.json)**\nframework with Yara signatures.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\n[Special thanks to Casey Brooks of Leidos Cyber for providing valuable support to](https://www.linkedin.com/in/solgrid/)\nFlashpoint during this research.\n\n\n-----",
