The malware was primarily delivered to Ukrainian organizations coincident with the_\n_Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is intended for those looking for a high-level overview of the_\n_malware’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and mitigations._\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nFollowing recent wiper attacks against Ukrainian organizations involving the WhisperGate\nand HermeticWiper malware, a new destructive wiper, IsaacWiper, was observed on\nFebruary 24, 2022. Although no direct attribution for IsaacWiper or the other wiper malware\nfound targeting Ukraine has been made by researchers, the timing of these destructive\nattacks in conjunction with tensions and kinetic conflict in Ukraine suggests they are Russian\nin origin.\n\n## Key Judgments\n\nIsaacWiper is a destructive malware that overwrites all physical disks and logical\nvolumes on a victim’s machine.\nThere is no code overlap between IsaacWiper, HermeticWiper, or WhisperGate.\nIsaacWiper achieves a similar outcome by different means.\n\n## Background\n\nIn a [report released on March 1, 2022, ESET researchers identified a new destructive](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/)\nmalware that had been affecting a Ukrainian government network since February 24, 2022.\nThis malware, dubbed IsaacWiper, is distinct from the HermeticWiper malware previously\nreported. ESET stated that they observed IsaacWiper deployed at a Ukrainian organization\nthat was not previously affected by HermeticWiper, although they are still assessing any links\nbetween IsaacWiper and HermeticWiper. Furthermore, they are unable to attribute this\nmalware to any known threat actors due to a lack of significant code similarities with known\nmalware. One day after IsaacWiper was initially deployed, the threat actors deployed a\nsecond version that included debug log output, indicating that the malware was not working\nas intended.\n**_[Editor’s Note: This post is an excerpt of a full report.
