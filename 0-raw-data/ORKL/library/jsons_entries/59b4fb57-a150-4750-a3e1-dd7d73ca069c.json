The backdoor has been analyzed previously [11] and is a robust tool associated\nwith this group, likely being used as an early stage reconnaissance tool.\n\nIn this case, the dropper is being delivered with a benign and possibly stolen decoy document\ninviting recipients to a G20 task force meeting on the \"Digital Economy\". The Digital Economy\nevent is actually scheduled for October of this year in Hamburg, Germany. The dropper first\nappeared in mid-July, suggesting that this APT activity is potentially ongoing, with Turla actively\ntargeting G20 participants and/or those with interest in the G20, including member nations,\njournalists, and policymakers. This blog provides details on the dropper and known information\non the infection chain and current related Turla activity.\n\n**Actor Overview**\n\nTurla is a well-documented, long operating APT group that is widely believed to be a Russian\nstate-sponsored organization. Turla is perhaps most notoriously suspected as responsible for the\n\nSHARES\n\n\n-----\n\nVarious other Turla frameworks, implants, and campaigns have been detailed extensively by our\nfellow security organizations and companies [3-10].\n\n**Delivery**\n\nThe delivery of KopiLuwak in this instance is currently unknown as the MSIL dropper has only\n[been observed by Proofpoint researchers on a public malware repository. Assuming this variant](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/malware)\nof KopiLuwak has been observed in the wild, there are a number of ways it may have been\n[delivered including some of Turla’s previous attack methods such as spear phishing or via a](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spear-phishing)\n[watering hole. Based on the theme of the decoy PDF, it is very possible that the intended targets](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/watering-hole)\nare individuals or organizations that are on or have an interest in G20’s Digital Economy Task\nForce. This could include diplomats, experts in the areas of interest related to the Digital\nEconomy Task Force, or possibly even journalists.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe earliest step in any possible attack(s) involving this variant of KopiLuwak of which Proofpoint\nresearchers are currently aware begin with the MSIL dropper. The basic chain of events upon\nexecution of the MSIL dropper include dropping and executing both a PDF decoy and a\nJavascript (JS) dropper. As explained in further detail below, the JS dropper ultimately installs a\nJS decryptor onto an infected machine that will then finally decrypt and execute the actual\nKopiLuwak backdoor in memory only (Fig. 1).\n\n_Figure 1: Diagram showing execution beginning with the MSIL dropper_\n\nAs Proofpoint has not yet observed this attack in the wild it is likely that there is an additional\ncomponent that leads to the execution of the MSIL payload. This may include a malicious\nSHARES\n\n\n-----\n\nwatering hole attack.\n\n\nThe KopiLuwak MSIL dropper is straightforward and contains absolutely no obfuscation or antianalysis. Internally the MSIL dropper is called Runer.exe and also contains a PDB string:\n“c:\\LocalDisc_D\\MyProjects\\Runer\\Runer\\obj\\Release\\Runer.pdb”. The Stage1 JS and PDF\ndecoy are both stored in plaintext in the dropper and are simply written to %APPDATA% then\nexecuted (Fig. 2).\n\n_Figure 2: MSIL dropper writing both the Stage1 JS and decoy PDF then executing both_\n\nBoth of the dropped files have hardcoded names: the JS is named Scr.js while the PDF is named\n_Save the Date G20 Digital Economy Taskforce 23 24 October.pdf. The decoy in this case is an_\ninvitation to save the date for a meeting of the G20’s Digital Economy Taskforce (Fig. 3) in\nHamburg, Germany.\n\n_Figure 3: PDF decoy with a “Save the Date” invitation for a G20 Digital Economy Taskforce_\n_meeting_\n\n\nSHARES\n\n\n-----\n\nwith access to the invitation was already compromised. Alternatively, the document may have\nbeen legitimately obtained from a recipient.\n\nProofpoint researchers ascertain with medium confidence that the document is legitimate and not\nfabricated. One piece of evidence suggesting that the document could be authentic is that in the\ndocument’s exif metadata, the creator tool is listed as “BE.D4.113.1” (Fig. 4) which matches\nanother PDF document that appears to have been scanned and is hosted on the\n_Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie website (Fig. 5)._\n\n_Figure 4: Exif metadata from the decoy PDF_\n\n_Figure 5: Exif metadata from the PDF hosted on bmwi[.]de_\n\nBMWi, which translates to Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, is the organization\nfrom which the decoy document supposedly originated. Both documents were also supposedly\ncreated on a KONICA MINOLTA bizhub C284e according to their exif metadata.\n\n_Scr.js Analysis_\n\nScr.js is essentially a dropper for the actual backdoor in addition to running all the necessary\ncommands to fingerprint the infected system and set up persistence. Scr.js first creates a\nscheduled task named PolicyConverter for persistence. This scheduled task should execute\nshortly after being created and is then scheduled to run every 10 minutes. The scheduled task is\nexecuted with the following parameters: “appidpolicyconverter.js FileTypeXML\n_gwVAj83JsiqTz5fG”. Similar to the older KopiLuwak variant, the second parameter is used as an_\nRC4 key to decrypt the encrypted JS backdoor code contained in appidpolicyconverter.js.\n\n\nSHARES\n\n\n-----\n\nthe following location: “C:\\Users\\[executing\n_user]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Protect\\appidpolicyconverter.js”_\n\nLastly, Scr.js executes various commands to fingerprint details about the infected system. In the\nolder variant of KopiLuwak, these commands were executed directly from the backdoor JS. Now,\nhowever, they have been moved to the dropper. Despite moving the machine fingerprinting code\nto the dropper, all of the commands are the same as in the older sample (and executed in the\nsame order) except for the following three additions:\n\n- dir “%programfiles%\\Kaspersky Lab”\n\n- dir “%programfiles(x86)%\\Kaspersky Lab”\n\n- tracert www.google.com\n\nInterestingly the only anti-virus company that is specifically fingerprinted is Kaspersky, which was\npossibly added as a result of their public analysis of this backdoor. The output from the\ncommands are saved to the following location: “%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Protect\\~~.tmp”\n\n_appidpolicyconverter.js Analysis_\n\nThe appidpolicyconverter.js script contains a large string that is first base64-decoded then RC4decrypted using the supplied parameter as a key (“gwVAj83JsiqTz5fG”) from the executed task.\nOnce the KopiLuwak backdoor code is successfully decrypted, it is then executed with eval().\n\nThe decrypted code functions similarly to the original KopiLuwak discussed by Kaspersky with\nsome slight changes. The backdoor still communicates with what appear to be two compromised,\nlegitimate websites using HTTP POST requests (Fig. 6).\n\n_Figure 6: Hardcoded legitimate, compromised command and control servers_\n\nDiffering from the older sample, the HTTP User-Agent is now hardcoded and no longer contains\na component unique to each infected machine.\n\nEach HTTP POST request sent to the command and control (C&C) will contain information in its\nclient body. The plaintext content is first preceded with a hardcoded key “Prc1MHxF_VB0ht7S”.\nNext, the key is followed by a separator string “ridid”. Next, the hardcoded key\n“Prc1MHxF_VB0ht7S” is used to encode the infected system’s OS installation date (Fig. 7).\n\n\nSHARES\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Retrieving the OS installation date_\n\nIf any additional information is being sent to the C&C it will then be appended after the encoded\ninstallation date. Finally, the data is encrypted with RC4 using a hardcoded key:\n“01a8cbd328df18fd49965d68e2879433” and then quoted (Fig. 8).\n\n_Figure 8: HTTP POST to KopiLuwak C2_\n\nResponses from the command and control are also encrypted using RC4 and the same key. After\nresponses from the C&C are decrypted, they are compared to a list of supported commands.\nThis newer variant of KopiLuwak has several different supported command keywords, including\none additional command, giving a total of five commands versus the old variant’s four (Table 1).\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\nexit Send the content infected system’s fingerprint info stored in ~~.tmp and exit\n\nupld Exfiltrate content from provided filename (from C2) to C2. Max exfiltrated file size is\n<= 1048576 bytes (1MB)\n\ninst Two options for this command:\n-execute provided JS using eval, send contents of ~~.tmp to C2, delete ~~.tmp\n-save provided content to a file in %Appdata%\\Microsoft\\Protect\\a3q4d.[ext], execute\nthe file, sleep for a random amount of time, delete the file, send the contents of\n~~.tmp to C2, and delete ~~.tmp\n\nwait Exit the script. The scheduled task would execute the backdoor again in ~10 minutes\n\ndwld Saves the provided content with provided extension to\n%Appdata%\\Microsoft\\Protect\\D8chd.[ext]. If successful sends success message to\nC2.\nSHARES\n\n\n-----\n\nThe newer variant of KopiLuwak is now capable of exfiltrating files to the C&C as well as\ndownloading files and saving them to the infected machine. Although these capabilities could\nhave been accomplished in the previous variant by executing arbitrary commands, they are now\nimplemented with their own dedicated commands. Despite the added capabilities, we still agree\nwith Kaspersky that this backdoor is likely used as an initial reconnaissance tool and would\nprobably be used as a staging point to deploy one of Turla’s more fully featured implants. We also\nbelieve this backdoor will continue to be used in the future as suggested by the continued\ndevelopment of the backdoor itself as well as the new delivery mechanisms.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBecause the samples were obtained from a public malware repository and we have not yet\nobserved them in the wild, the full scope and impact of the attack (or, possibly, a pending attack)\ncannot be fully assessed. However, for PCs running the .NET framework (which includes most\nmodern Windows operating systems), the potential impact is high:\n\n- The JavaScript dropper profiles the victim’s system, establishes persistence, and installs the\nKopiLuwak backdoor.\n\n- KopiLuwak is a robust tool capable of exfiltrating data, downloading additional payloads, and\nexecuting arbitrary commands provided by the actor(s)\n\nThe high profile of potentially targeted individuals associated with the G20 and early\nreconnaissance nature of the tools involved bear further watching. We have notified CERT-Bund\nof this activity.\n\nWe will continue to track the activities associated both with this actor and these new tools and\nupdate this blog as details emerge.\n\n**References**\n\n[[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_cyberattack_on_United_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_cyberattack_on_United_States)\n\n[[2] https://www.govcert.admin.ch/blog/22/technical-report-about-the-ruag-espionage-case](https://www.govcert.admin.ch/blog/22/technical-report-about-the-ruag-espionage-case)\n\n[[3] https://securelist.com/the-epic-turla-operation/65545/](https://securelist.com/the-epic-turla-operation/65545/)\n\n[[4] https://securelist.com/satellite-turla-apt-command-and-control-in-the-sky/72081/](https://securelist.com/satellite-turla-apt-command-and-control-in-the-sky/72081/)\n\n[[5] https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/848-DID-242/images/rpt-witchcoven.pdf](https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/848-DID-242/images/rpt-witchcoven.pdf)\n\n[6]\nhttps://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/water\nbug-attack-group.pdf\n\n[7] https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/03/30/carbon-paper-peering-turlas-second-stagebackdoor/SHARES\n\n\nbackdoor/\n\n\n-----\n\nextension-abusing-instagram/\n\n\n\n[9] https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2014/11/23937-the-uroburos-case-new-sophisticated-ratidentified\n\n[[10] https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2015/01/23926-analysis-of-project-cobra](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2015/01/23926-analysis-of-project-cobra)\n\n[[11] https://securelist.com/kopiluwak-a-new-javascript-payload-from-turla/77429/](https://securelist.com/kopiluwak-a-new-javascript-payload-from-turla/77429/)\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n_KopiLuwak MSIL Dropper_\n\n7481e87023604e7534d02339540ddd9565273dd51c13d7677b9b4c9623f0440b\n\n_KopiLuwak JS Dropper “Scr.js”_\n\n1c76a66a670a6f69b4fea25ca0ba4885eca9e1b85a2afbab61da3b4a6d52ae19\n\n_KopiLuwak JavaScript Decryptor “appidpolicyconverter.js”_\n\n5698c92fb8fe7ded0ff940c75979f44734650e4f2c852bdb4cbc9d46e7993185\n\n_Benign PDF Decoy “Save the Date G20 Digital Economy Taskforce 23 24 October.pdf”_\n\nc978da455018a73ddbc9e1d2bf8c208ad3ec2e622850f68ef6b0aae939e5d2ab\n\n_KopiLuwak C&C_\n\nhxxp://www[.]huluwa[.]uk/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/includes/class-wc-log.php\n\n\nhxxp://tresor-rare[.]com[.]hk/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-seo/vendor/xrstf/composerphp52/lib/xrstf/Composer52/LogsLoader.php\n\n**ET and ETPRO Suricata/Snort Coverage**\n\n2827574,ETPRO TROJAN Turla JS/KopiLuwak CnC Beacon M1\n\n2827575,ETPRO TROJAN Turla JS/KopiLuwak CnC Beacon M2\n\n###### Most recent\n\n\n## \n\n\nSHARES\n\n\n-----\n\n[Double dipping: Diverting ransomware Bitcoin payments via .onion domains](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/double-dipping-diverting-ransomware-bitcoin-payments-onion-domains)\n\n\n###### 1 MONTH AGO\n\n[Proofpoint Q4 2017 Threat Report: Coin miners and ransomware are front and center](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/proofpoint-q4-2017-threat-report-coin-miners-and-ransomware-are-front-and-center)\n\n###### 1 MONTH AGO\n\n[Holiday lull?
