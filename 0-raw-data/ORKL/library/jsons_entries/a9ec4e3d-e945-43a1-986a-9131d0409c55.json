This remote access trojan (RAT) has capabilities to log keystrokes, access the victim's camera, steal credentials stored in browsers, open a reverse shell, upload/download files, view the victim's desktop, perform process, file, and registry manipulations, and capabilities to let the attacker update, uninstall, restart, close, disconnect the RAT and rename its campaign ID. Through the Command & Control (CnC) server software, the attacker has capabilities to create and configure the malware to spread through USB drives. \n\n \"njRAT\" is currently leveraged by advanced threat actors in the Middle East, in particular when delivered via HTTP (i.e. Phishing attack or Drive-by download). It has also been observed that attackers are delivering \"njRAT\" embedded in other applications (i.e. L517 v.0.994 Word List Generator), and compressed with EZIRIZ .NET Reactor/.NET protector. Obfuscation with the use of compressors or protectors is a technique used by attackers to prevent detection by network- based and host-based security defenses.\n\n We have observed the majority of the attacks leveraging \"njRAT\" to be against organizations based in or focused on the Middle East region in the government, telecom, and energy sectors. However as this is a publicly available tool it can be attained and deployed with ease regardless of location or industry. \n\n During the analysis of \"njRAT\", it was observed that some of the top antivirus vendors were not currently detecting some variants of this threat. \n\n Some of the file names of carrier files or njRAT samples observed were: L517 v0.994.exe, RealUpgrade.exe, password hotmail cracker 2013.exe, elisa.exe, Crack All Games.exe, fresh cc\n\n```\nUsers are granted permission to copy and/or distribute this document in its original electronic form and print copies for personal use.\n\nThis document cannot be modified or converted to any other electronic or machine-readable form in whole or in part without prior\n\nwritten approval of Fidelis Security Systems, Inc.\n\nWhile we have done our best to ensure that the material found in this document is accurate, Fidelis Security Systems, Inc. makes no\n\nguarantee that the information contained herein is error free.\n\nCopyright © 2013 General Dynamics Fidelis Cybersecurity Solutions Rev. 2013-06-25\n\n\n-----\n\n#### www.fidelissecurity.com\n\n www.threatgeek.com\n\n @FidSecSys\n\n +1800.652.4020\n\n##### cvv all info 2013_txt.scr, spoolsv.exe, Hack Origin Game's.exe, Authorization form may - 2013 - 115444.scr, and Authorization.exe.\n\n This document will provide detailed information about the njRAT's functionality, file system indicators, network indicators, some of the campaign IDs observed, MD5 hashes, and domains. It will also go over a detailed analysis of one of the malware variants.\n\n### Threat Overview\n\n##### The \"njRAT\" is a robust remote access trojan that once it reaches and infects the end-point, allows the attacker to have full control over the Victim system. With this access, the attacker can start scanning other systems in the victim network to perform lateral movement. \n\n We will start this section by performing analysis on the following \"njRAT\" sample: \n\n - Filename:  Authorization.exe - MD5:  1d3baedd747f6f9bf92c81eb9f63b34b\n\n The \"Authorization.exe\" njRAT malware was embedded and dropped in the victim system by the following file: \"Authorization form may - 2013 - 115444.scr\" (MD5: 63781fe1932e612c6c29225d25515111).\n\n The next section (Indicators & Mitigation Strategies), will provide information about other variants of the malware obtained. \n\n## Summary\n\n##### The \"Authorization.exe\" malware sample was created with version V.0.5 of this RAT. The njRAT application was developed with VB.NET (Visual Basic .NET).\n\n When the malware connects to the Command & Control (CnC) server, the attacker is able to perform the following actions from the njRAT CnC server GUI: \n\n - Open a 'File Manager' window to manipulate files o This window allows the attacker to Upload & Download, Run, Delete, Edit, Rename, Copy, Cut, Paste, and Empty files. o The window also allows the attacks to create new folders in the Victim system - Open a 'Run File' window o This window allows the attacker to upload a file, or provide a link to a file to run in the Victim system - Open a 'Remote Desktop' window o When selected, it opens a live window of the Victim's user desktop - Open a 'Remote Cam' window o This window allows the attacker to obtain access to the Victim's system camera to see the Victim user\n\nCopyright © 2013 General Dynamics Fidelis Cybersecurity Solutions Rev. 2013-06-25\n\n\n-----\n\n#### www.fidelissecurity.com\n\n www.threatgeek.com\n\n @FidSecSys\n\n +1800.652.4020\n\n##### - Open a 'Remote Shell' window o This window opens a reverse shell window and allow the attacker to perform all the activities possible from the command prompt  - Open a 'Process Manager' window o This window allows the attacker to Refresh the process list, Kill processes, Suspend processes, Resume processes - Open a 'Registry' window  o This window allows the attacker manipulate the Victim's system registry (edit, delete, create keys and values) - Open a 'Keylogger' window o When this option is selected, the keylogger file is automatically uploaded from the Victim system into the attacker's machine - Open a 'Get Passwords' window o This window appears to collect all the passwords stored by the browser (User, Password, URL, App). At the moment of writing this report, the functionality was not confirmed. When the option is selected, the malware searches Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera directories. - Open a 'Server' window o This window allows the attacker to Update, Uninstall, Restart, Close, Disconnect, or Rename the malware running in the Victim system - Open an 'Open Folder' window o This window open the local folder in the attackers machine in which the artifacts collected through the \"njRAT\" GUI are stored in his/her system - Open a 'Builder' Window o This window allows the attacker to build new Clients to be deployed to Victims or used in attack campaigns. Some of the options in this builders allows the attacker to configure:\n � C2 node IP � C2 node port � Vic Tim Name (Looks like this could be used to identify the attack campaign) � Malware name (when it makes a copies itself) � Directory to make a copy of the malware when it is executed � Capabilities to spread via USB � Select the malware icon � Protect the malware process � Stub Randomization\n\nCopyright © 2013 General Dynamics Fidelis Cybersecurity Solutions Rev. 2013-06-25\n\n\n-----\n\n#### www.fidelissecurity.com\n\n www.threatgeek.com\n\n @FidSecSys\n\n +1800.652.4020\n\n##### The following is a screenshot of the \"njRAT\" v.0.5 CnC GUI when a Victim system connects to it:\n\n The following \"About\" information was observed in this version (0.5.0) of the C2 server software found online:\n\n\n###### Project : njRat\n\n Verison  : 0.5.0\n\n Coded By : njq8\n\n FireFox Stealer : DarkSel\n\n Paltalk Stealer : pr0t0fag\n\n Chrome Stealer : RockingWithTheBest\n\n Opera Stealer : Black-Blood, KingCobra\n\n MySite : http://xnjq8x.com\n\n\nCopyright © 2013 General Dynamics Fidelis Cybersecurity Solutions Rev. 2013-06-25\n\n\n-----\n\n#### www.fidelissecurity.com\n\n www.threatgeek.com\n\n @FidSecSys\n\n +1800.652.4020\n\n##### The following screenshot shows the Builder interface and default parameters:\n\n The \"Authorization.exe\" malware has keylogger functionality. It stores the logged keystrokes in the following file: \"[CWD]\\.tmp\". When the malware is dropped by the \"Authorization form may - 2013 - 115444.scr\" carrier file, the logged keystrokes are stored in: \"C:\\Extracted\\.tmp\".\n\n The IP address used by the Command & Control (C2) node appears to be under an IP range owned by: \"Palestinian Internet Services, P. O. BOX 5111 Gaza City, Palestine\". \n\n Variants of this malware have been observed by the community since at least 2012. The malware appears to be known by the community as: njRAT, MSIL/Bladabindi, and Backdoor.LV. \n\n When the \"Authorization.exe\" malware is executed it:\n\n - Creates a copy of itself in the following locations: o %APPDATA%\\msnco.exe o C:\\Documents and Settings\\%USERNAME%\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\b6554e5bcfef391ff7a7ffda58092e10.exe\n - Tries to open the following file: [CWD]\\ Authorization.exe.config\n - Entrenches in the system for persistence in the following registry locations:\n```\n    o HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Ru\n     n\\b6554e5bcfef391ff7a7ffda58092e10\n    o HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\R\n     un\\b6554e5bcfef391ff7a7ffda58092e10\n\n```\nCopyright © 2013 General Dynamics Fidelis Cybersecurity Solutions Rev. 2013-06-25\n\n\n-----\n\n#### www.fidelissecurity.com\n\n www.threatgeek.com\n\n @FidSecSys\n\n +1800.652.4020\n\n##### Makes the following modifications to the registry to bypass the Windows Firewall:\n```\n    o Key:\n     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SharedAcc\n     ess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\StandardProfile\\AuthorizedApplic\n     ations\\List\\[%APPDATA%]\\msnco.exe\n    o Value: [%APPDATA%]\\msnco.exe:*:Enabled:msnco.exe\n - Beacons to the following C2 node over TCP port 1177: \"217.66.231.245\"\n The attacker tries to make sure the malware will run in the system by making the second copy into the above mentioned directory (C:\\Documents and Settings\\%USERNAME%\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\b6554e5bcfef391ff7a7ffda58092e10.exe)\n o This causes the malware to execute again when the system is rebooted and re-starts the infection in the system. Once the system is infected again, it will beacon to the C2 node.\n\n The attacker tries to trick the user by using different icons for the malware. Various samples were observed with MS Word and PDF icons. The following is a screenshot of how the file will look like to a normal user:\n\n When the system is configured to show file extensions, the EXE extension is now revealed:\n\n When the malware connects to the C2 node, it will send information about the victim system, malware version, open windows, etc. The following is the network traffic observed: \n\n```\n\nlv|'|'|TndfQzQyNjRFQkI=|'|'|VICTIM|'|'|Examiner|'|'|2013-06-21|'|'|USA|'|'|Win XP ProfessionalSP2\n**x86|'|'|No|'|'|0.5.0E|'|'|..|'|'|Y3B0YnRfUHJvY2Vzc19SZWdpc3RyeV9GaWxlX0luZm8ubG9nIC0gTm90ZXB**\n**hZA==|'|'|[endof]act|'|'|**\n**Y3B0YnRfUHJvY2Vzc19SZWdpc3RyeV9GaWxlX0luZm8ubG9nIC0gTm90ZXBhZA== [endof]**\n\n\nCopyright © 2013 General Dynamics Fidelis Cybersecurity Solutions Rev. 2013-06-25\n\n\n-----\n\n#### www.fidelissecurity.com\n\n www.threatgeek.com\n\n @FidSecSys\n\n +1800.652.4020\n\n##### The following table provides information of some of the fields observed in the network traffic:\n\n**Field** **Information**\n\n**TndfQzQyNjRFQkI=** Base64 encoded data.
