    "plain_text": "# APT trends report Q2 2019\n\n**securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2019/91897**\n\nBy GReAT\n\nFor two years, the Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky has been\npublishing quarterly summaries of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity. The summaries are\nbased on our threat intelligence research and provide a representative snapshot of what we have\npublished and discussed in greater detail in our private APT reports. They aim to highlight the\nsignificant events and findings that we feel people should be aware of.\n\nThis is our latest installment, focusing on activities that we observed during Q2 2019.\n\nReaders who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more information\non a specific report are encouraged to contact ‘intelreports@kaspersky.com’.\n\n## The most remarkable findings\n\n[In April, we published our report on TajMahal, a previously unknown APT framework that has](https://securelist.com/project-tajmahal/90240/)\nbeen active for the last five years. This is a highly sophisticated spyware framework that includes\nbackdoors, loaders, orchestrators, C2 communicators, audio recorders, keyloggers, screen and\nwebcam grabbers, documents, and cryptography key stealers; and even its own file indexer for\nthe victim’s computer. We discovered up to 80 malicious modules stored in its encrypted Virtual\nFile System – one of the highest numbers of plugins we have ever seen in an APT toolset. The\nmalware features its own indexer, emergency C2s, the ability to steal specific files from external\ndrives when they become available again, and much more. There are two different packages,\nself-named ‘Tokyo’ and ‘Yokohama’ and the targeted computers we found include both packages.\nWe think the attackers used Tokyo as the first stage infection, deploying the fully functional\nYokohama package on interesting victims, and then leaving Tokyo in place for backup purposes.\nSo far, our telemetry has revealed just a single victim, a diplomatic body from a country in Central\nAsia. This begs the question, why go to all that trouble for just one victim? We think there may be\nother victims that we haven’t found yet. This theory is supported by the fact that we couldn’t see\nhow one of the files in the VFS was used by the malware, opening the door to the possibility of\nadditional versions of the malware that have yet to be detected.\n\n[On May 14, FT reported that a zero-day vulnerability in WhatsApp had been exploited, allowing](https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-hack-phone-call-voip-buffer-overflow/)\nattackers to eavesdrop on users, read their encrypted chats, turn on the microphone and camera\nand install spyware that allows even further surveillance, such as browsing through a victim’s\nphotos and videos, accessing their contact list and more. In order to exploit the vulnerability, the\nattacker simply needs to call the victim via WhatsApp. This specially crafted call can trigger a\nbuffer overflow in WhatsApp, allowing an attacker to take control of the application and execute\narbitrary code in it. Apparently, the attackers used this method to not only snoop on people’s\nchats and calls but also to exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in the operating system,\nwhich allowed them to install applications on the device. The vulnerability affects WhatsApp for\nAndroid prior to 2.19.134, WhatsApp Business for Android prior to 2.19.44, WhatsApp for iOS\nprior to 2.19.51, WhatsApp Business for iOS prior to 2.19.51, WhatsApp for Windows Phone prior\n\n\n-----\n\nto 2.18.348 and WhatsApp for Tizen prior to 2.18.15. WhatsApp released patches for the\n[vulnerability on May 13. Some have suggested that the spyware may be Pegasus, developed by](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/05/14/whatsapp_zero_day/)\nIsraeli company NSO.\n\n## Russian-speaking activity\n\nWe continue to track the activities of Russian-speaking APT groups. These groups usually show\na particular interest in political activities, but apart from a couple of interesting exceptions we\nfailed to detect any remarkable examples during the last quarter.\n\nWe did find a potential connection between Hades and a leak at the RANA institute. Hades is\n[possibly connected to the Sofacy threat actor, most notable for being behind Olympic Destroyer,](https://securelist.com/olympic-destroyer-is-still-alive/86169/)\n[as well as ExPetr and several disinformation campaigns such as the Macron leaks. Earlier this](https://securelist.com/expetrpetyanotpetya-is-a-wiper-not-ransomware/78902/)\nyear, a website named Hidden Reality published leaks allegedly related to an Iranian entity\nnamed the RANA institute. This was the third leak in two months that disclosed details of alleged\nIranian threat actors and groups. Close analysis of the materials, the infrastructure and the\ndedicated website used by those behind the leak led us to believe that these leaks might be\nconnected to Hades. This might be part of a disinformation campaign in which Hades helps to\nraise doubts about the quality of the information leaked in other cases from earlier this year.\n\nZebrocy continued adding new tools to its arsenal using various kinds of programming languages.\nWe found Zebrocy deploying a compiled Python script, which we call PythocyDbg, within a\nSoutheast Asian foreign affairs organization: this module primarily provides for the stealthy\ncollection of network proxy and communications debug capabilities. In early 2019, Zebrocy shifted\nits development efforts with the use of Nimrod/Nim, a programming language with syntax\nresembling both Pascal and Python that can be compiled down to JavaScript or C targets. Both\nthe Nim downloaders that the group mainly uses for spear-phishing, and other Nim backdoor\ncode, are currently being produced by Zebrocy and delivered alongside updated compiled AutoIT\nscripts, Go, and Delphi modules. The targets of this new Nimcy downloader and backdoor set\nincludes diplomats, defense officials and ministry of foreign affairs staff, from whom they want to\nsteal login credentials, keystrokes, communications, and various files. The group appears to have\nturned its attention towards the March events involving Pakistan and India, and unrelated\ndiplomatic and military officials, while maintaining ongoing access to local and remote networks\nbelonging to Central Asian governments.\n\nWe also recently observed some interesting new artifacts that we relate to Turla with varying\ndegrees of confidence.\n\nIn April 2019, we observed a new COMpfun-related targeted campaign using new malware. The\nKaspersky Attribution Engine shows strong code similarities between the new family and the old\nCOMpfun. Moreover, the original COMpfun is used as a downloader in one of the spreading\nmechanisms. We called the newly identified modules Reductor after a .pdb path left in some\nsamples. We believe the malware was developed by the same COMPfun authors that, internally,\nwe tentatively associated with the Turla APT, based on victimology. Besides the typical RAT\nfunctions (upload, download, execute files), Reductor’s authors put a lot of effort into manipulating\ninstalled digital root certificates and marking outbound TLS traffic with unique host-related\nidentifiers. The malware adds embedded root certificates to the target host and allows operators\nto add additional ones remotely through a named pipe. The solution used by Reductor’s\ndevelopers to mark TLS traffic is the most ingenious part The authors don’t touch the network\n\n\n-----\n\nmemory. Browsers use PRNG to generate the client random sequence during the very\nbeginning of the TLS handshake. Reductor adds the victims’ unique encrypted hardware- and\nsoftware-based identifiers to this “client random” field.\n\nAdditionally we identified a new backdoor that we attribute with medium confidence to Turla. The\nbackdoor, named Tunnus, is .NET-based malware with the ability to run commands or perform file\nactions on an infected system and send the results to its C2. So far, the C2 infrastructure has\nbeen built using compromised sites with vulnerable WordPress installations. According to our\ntelemetry, Tunnus’s activity started last March and was still active at the time of writing.\n\n[ESET has also reported PowerShell scripts being used by Turla to provide direct, in-memory](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/05/29/turla-powershell-usage/)\n[loading and execution of malware. This is not the first time this threat actor has used PowerShell](https://securelist.com/shedding-skin-turlas-fresh-faces/88069/)\nin this way, but the group has improved these scripts and is now using them to load a wide range\nof custom malware from its traditional arsenal. The payloads delivered via the PowerShell scripts\n– the RPC backdoor and PowerStallion – are highly customized.\n\n[Symantec has also been tracking targeted attacks in a series of campaigns against governments](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/waterbug-espionage-governments)\nand international organizations across the globe over the past 18 months. The attacks have\nfeatured a rapidly evolving toolset and, in one notable instance, the apparent hijacking of\ninfrastructure belonging to OilRig. They have uncovered evidence that the Waterbug APT group\n(aka Turla, Snake, Uroburos, Venomous Bear and KRYPTON) has conducted a hostile takeover\n[of an attack platform belonging to OilRig (aka Crambus). Researchers at Symantec suspect that](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/06/researchers-think-nation-sponsored-hackers-attacked-rival-espionage-group/)\nTurla used the hijacked network to attack a Middle Eastern government that OilRig had already\n[penetrated. This is not the first time that we have seen this type of activity. Clearly, operations of](https://www.zdnet.com/article/russian-apt-hacked-iranian-apts-infrastructure-back-in-2017/)\nthis kind make the job of attribution more difficult.\n\nThe international community continues to focus on the activity of Russian-speaking threat actors.\nOver the last 18 months, the UK has shared information on attacks attributed to Russian hackers\n[with 16 NATO allies, including attacks on critical national infrastructure and attempts to](https://www.zdnet.com/article/uk-says-it-warned-16-nato-allies-of-russian-hacking-activities/)\ncompromise central government networks. In his former capacity as UK foreign secretary, Jeremy\nHunt, recently urged nations to band together to create a deterrent for state-sponsored hackers.\nAs part of this push, the UK and its intelligence partners have been slowly moving towards a\n‘name and shame’ approach when dealing with cyberattacks. The use of the ‘court of public\n[opinion’ in response to cyberattacks is a trend that we highlighted in our predictions for 2019. To](https://securelist.com/kaspersky-security-bulletin-threat-predictions-for-2019/88878/)\nhelp this new strategy the EU recently passed new laws that will make it possible for EU member\nstates to impose economic sanctions against foreign hackers.\n\n[Researchers at the Microstep Intelligence Bureau have published a report on targeted attacks on](https://x.threatbook.cn/nodev4/vb4/article?threatInfoID=1417)\nthe Ukrainian government that they attribute to the Gamaredon threat actor. Recently, the group\nlaunched attacks on a number of state organizations in Ukraine using Pterodo, malware used\nexclusively by this group. Since February, the attackers have deployed a large number of\ndynamic domain names and newly registered domain names believed to be used to launch\ntargeted attacks against elections in Ukraine.\n\n## Chinese-speaking activity\n\nWe found an active campaign by a Chinese APT group we call SixLittleMonkeys that uses a new\nversion of the Microcin Trojan and a RAT that we call HawkEye as a last stager. The campaign\nmainly targets government bodies in Central Asia For persistence the operators use DLL search\n\n\n-----\n\nthe Google updater, GoogleCrashHandler.exe, for .DLL hijacking. Custom encryptors protect the\nnext stagers from detection on disk and from automated analysis, using the same encryption keys\nin different samples. For secure TLS communication with its C2, the malware uses the Secure\nChannel (Schannel) Windows security package.\n\n[ESET discovered that the attackers behind the Plead malware have been distributing it using](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/05/14/plead-malware-mitm-asus-webstorage/)\ncompromised routers and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks in April. Researchers have detected\nthis activity in Taiwan, where the Plead malware has been most actively deployed. Trend Micro\n[has previously reported the use of this malware in targeted attacks by the BlackTech group,](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/appendix-following-the-trail-of-blacktechs-cyber-espionage-campaigns.pdf)\nprimarily focused on cyber-espionage in Asia. ESET telemetry has revealed multiple attempts to\ndeploy it.\n\n[LuckyMouse activity detected by Palo Alto involved the attackers installing web shells on](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/emissary-panda-attacks-middle-east-government-sharepoint-servers/)\nSharePoint servers to compromise government organizations in the Middle East, probably\nexploiting CVE-2019-0604, a remote code execution vulnerability used to compromise the server\nand eventually install a web shell. The actors uploaded a variety of tools that they used to perform\nadditional activities on the compromised network, such as dumping credentials, as well as\nlocating and pivoting to additional systems on the network. Of particular note is the group’s use of\ntools to identify systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144, the vulnerability exploited by EternalBlue\nand used in the 2017 WannaCry attacks. This activity appears to be related to campaigns\nexploiting CVE-2019-0604 mentioned in recent security alerts from the Saudi Arabian National\nCyber Security Center and the Canadian Center for Cyber Security.\n\nLast year, a number of Chinese hackers allegedly linked to the Chinese government were indicted\nin the US. In May, the US Department of Justice indicted a Chinese national for a series of\ncomputer intrusions, including the 2015 data breach of health insurance company Anthem which\naffected more than 78 million people.\n\n## Middle East\n\nThe last three months have been very interesting for this region, especially considering the\nmultiple leaks of alleged Iranian activity that were published within just a few weeks of each other.\nEven more interesting is the possibility that one of the leaks may have been part of a\ndisinformation campaign carried out with the help of the Sofacy/Hades actor.\n\nIn March, someone going by the handle Dookhtegan or Lab_dookhtegan started posting\nmessages on Twitter using the hashtag #apt34. Several files were shared via Telegram that\nsupposedly belonged to the OilRig threat actor. They included logins and passwords of several\nalleged hacking victims, tools, infrastructure details potentially related to different intrusions, the\nrésumés of the alleged attackers and a list of web shells – apparently relating to the period 201418.\n\nThe targeting and TTPs are consistent with this threat actor, but it was impossible to confirm the\norigins of the tools included in the dump. Assuming that the data in the dump is accurate, it also\nshows the global reach of the OilRig group, which has generally been thought to operate primarily\nin the Middle East.\n\nOn April 22, an entity going by the alias Bl4ck_B0X created a Telegram channel named\nGreenLeakers. The purpose of the channel, as stated by its creator, was to publish information\n\n\n-----\n\nOn April 27, three screenshots were posted in the GreenLeakers Telegram channel, containing\nalleged screenshots from a MuddyWater C2 server. On May 1, the channel was closed to the\npublic and its status changed to private. This was before Bl4ck_B0X had the chance to publish\nthe promised information on the MuddyWater group. The reason for the closure is still unclear.\n\nFinally, a website named Hidden Reality published leaks allegedly related to an entity named the\nIranian RANA institute. It was the third leak in two months disclosing details of alleged Iranian\nthreat actors and groups.\n\nInterestingly, this leak differed from the others by employing a website that allows anyone to\nbrowse the leaked documents. It also relies on Telegram and Twitter profiles to post messages\nrelated to Iranian CNO capabilities. The Hidden Reality website contains internal documents, chat\nmessages and other data related to the RANA institute’s CNO (Computer Network Operations)\ncapabilities, as well as information about victims. Previous leaks were focused more on tools,\nsource code and individual actor profiles.\n\nClose analysis of the materials, the infrastructure and the dedicated website used by the leakers,\nprovided clues that led us to believe Sofacy/Hades may be connected to these leaks.\n\nThere was also other Muddywater activity unrelated to the leak, as well as discoveries linked to\nprevious activity by the group, such as ClearSky’s discovery of two domains hacked by\nMuddyWater at the end of 2018 to host the code of its POWERSTATS malware.\n\n[In April, Cisco Talos published its analysis of the BlackWater campaign, related to MuddyWater](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/05/recent-muddywater-associated-blackwater.html)\nactivity. The campaign shows how the attackers added three distinct steps to their operations,\nallowing them to bypass certain security controls to evade detection: an obfuscated VBA script to\nestablish persistence as a registry key, a PowerShell stager and FruityC2 agent script, and an\nopen source framework on GitHub to further enumerate the host machine. This could allow the\nattackers to monitor web logs and determine whether someone outside the campaign has made a\nrequest to their server in an attempt to investigate the activity. Once the enumeration commands\nrun, the agent communicates with a different C2 and sends back data in the URL field. Trend\nMicro also reported MuddyWater’s use of a new multi-stage PowerShell-based backdoor called\nPOWERSTATS v3.\n\nWe published a private report about four Android malware families and their use of false flag\ntechniques, among other things. One of the campaigns sent spear-phishing emails to a university\nin Jordan and the Turkish government, using compromised legitimate accounts to trick victims\ninto installing malware.\n\n[Regarding other groups, we discovered new activity related to ZooPark, a cyber-espionage threat](https://securelist.com/whos-who-in-the-zoo/85394/)\nactor that has focused mainly on stealing data from Android devices. Our new findings include\nnew malicious samples and additional infrastructure that has been deployed since 2016. This also\nled to us discovering Windows malware implants deployed by the same threat actor. The\nadditional indicators we found shed some light on the targets of past campaigns, including Iranian\nKurds – mainly political dissidents and activists.\n\n[Recorded Future published an analysis of the infrastructure built by APT33 (aka Elfin) to target](https://www.recordedfuture.com/iranian-cyber-operations-infrastructure/)\nSaudi organizations. Following the exposure of a wide range of their infrastructure and operations\nby Symantec in March, researchers at Recorded Future discovered that APT33, or closely\naligned actors reacted by either parking or reassigning some of their domain infrastructure The\n\n\n-----\n\nlarge swath of operational infrastructure, well in excess of 1,200 domains, with many observed\ncommunicating with 19 different commodity RAT implants. An interesting development appears to\nbe their increased preference for njRAT, with over half of the observed suspected APT33\ninfrastructure being linked to njRAT deployment.\n\nOn a more political level, there were several news stories covering Iranian activity.\n\n[A group connected to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard has been blamed for a wave of cyber-](https://news.sky.com/story/iran-conducted-major-cyber-assault-on-key-uk-infrastructure-11676686)\nattacks against UK national infrastructure, including the Post Office, local government networks,\nprivate companies and banks. Personal data of thousands of employees were stolen. It is\nbelieved that the same group was also responsible for the attack on the UK parliamentary\nnetwork in 2017. The UK NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre) is providing assistance to\naffected organizations.\n\n[Microsoft recently obtained a court order in the US to seize control of 99 websites used by the](https://www.cyberscoop.com/microsoft-uses-court-order-shut-apt-linked-websites/)\nIranian hacking group APT35 (aka Phosphorus and Charming Kitten). The threat actor used\nspoofed websites, including those of Microsoft and Yahoo, to conduct cyberattacks against\nbusinesses, government agencies, journalists and activists who focus on Iran. The sinkholing of\nthese sites will force the group to recreate part of its infrastructure.\n\n[The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has reported an increase in](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-government-warns-of-data-wipers-used-in-iranian-cyberattacks/)\ncyberattacks by Iranian actors or proxies, targeting US industries and government agencies using\ndestructive wiper tools. The statement was posted on Twitter by CISA director, Chris Krebs.\n\n## Southeast Asia and Korean Peninsula\n\nThis quarter we detected a lot of Korean-related activity. However, for the rest of the Southeast\nAsian region there has not been that much activity, especially when compared to earlier periods.\n\nEarly in Q2, we identified an interesting Lazarus attack targeting a mobile gaming company in\nSouth Korea that we believe was aimed at stealing application source code. It’s clear that Lazarus\nkeeps updating its tools very quickly. Meanwhile, BlueNoroff, the Lazarus sub-group that typically\ntargets financial institutions, targeted a bank in Central Asia and a crypto-currency business in\nChina.\n\nIn a recent campaign, we observed ScarCruft using a multi-stage binary to infect several victims\nand ultimately install a final payload known as ROKRAT – a cloud service-based backdoor.\nScarCruft is a highly skilled APT group, historically using geo-political issues to target the Korean\nPeninsula. We found several victims worldwide identified as companies and individuals with ties\nto North Korea, as well as a diplomatic agency. Interestingly, we observed that ScarCruft\ncontinues to adopt publicly available exploit code in its tools. We also found an interesting overlap\nin a Russian-based victim targeted both by ScarCruft and DarkHotel – not the first time that we\nhave seen such an overlap.\n\n[ESET recently analyzed a new Mac OS sample from the OceanLotus group that had been](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/04/09/oceanlotus-macos-malware-update/)\nuploaded to VirusTotal. This backdoor shares its features with a previous Mac OS variant, but the\nstructure has changed and detection is now much harder. Researchers were unable to find the\ndropper associated with this sample, so they could not identify the initial compromise vector.\n\n[The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has reported Trojan ariants identified as](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/AR19-100A)\n\n\n-----\n\nsessions using valid public SSL certificates, disguising network connections with remote\nmalicious actors. One file contains a public SSL certificate and the payload of the file appears to\nbe encoded with a password or key. The remaining file does not contain any of the public SSL\ncertificates, but attempts outbound connections and drops four files: the dropped files primarily\ncontain IP addresses and SSL certificates.\n\nIn June, we came across an unusual set of samples used to target diplomatic, government and\nmilitary organizations in countries in South and Southeast Asia. The threat actor behind the\n[campaign, which we believe to be the PLATINUM APT group, uses an elaborate, previously](https://securelist.com/platinum-is-back/91135/)\nunseen, steganographic technique to conceal communication. A couple of years ago, we\npredicted that more and more APT and malware developers would use steganography, and this\ncampaign provides proof: the actors used two interesting steganography techniques in this APT.\nIt’s also interesting that the attackers decided to implement the utilities they need as one huge set\n– an example of the framework-based architecture that is becoming more and more popular.\n\n## Other interesting discoveries\n\n[On May 14, Microsoft released fixes for a critical Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE-](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2019/05/14/prevent-a-worm-by-updating-remote-desktop-services-cve-2019-0708/)\n2019-0708) in Remote Desktop Services (formerly known as Terminal Services) that affects some\nolder versions of Windows: Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008 and\nsome unsupported versions of Windows – including Windows 2003 and Windows XP. Details on\nhow to mitigate this vulnerability are available in our private report ‘Analysis and detection\nguidance for CVE-2019-0708’. The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) itself is not vulnerable. This\nvulnerability is pre-authentication and requires no user interaction. In other words, the\nvulnerability is ‘wormable’, meaning that any future malware that exploits this vulnerability could\npropagate from vulnerable computer to vulnerable computer in a similar way that WannaCry\nspread. Microsoft has not observed exploitation of this vulnerability, but believes it is highly likely\nthat malicious actors will write an exploit for it.\n\n[Early in June, researchers at Malwarebytes Labs observed a number of compromises on Amazon](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2019/06/magecart-skimmers-found-on-amazon-cloudfront-cdn/)\nCloudFront, a Content Delivery Network (CDN), where hosted JavaScript libraries were tampered\nwith and injected with web skimmers. Although attacks that involve CDNs usually affect a large\nnumber of web properties at once via their supply chain, this isn’t always the case. Some\nwebsites either use Amazon’s cloud infrastructure to host their own libraries or link to code\ndeveloped specifically for them and hosted on a custom AWS S3 bucket. Without properly\nvalidating externally loaded content, these sites are exposing their users to various threats,\nincluding some that pilfer credit card data. After analyzing these breaches, researchers found that\nthey are a continuation of a campaign from Magecart threat actors attempting to cast a wide net\naround many different CDNs. CDNs are widely used because they provide great benefits to\nwebsite owners, including optimizing load times and cost, as well as helping with all sorts of data\nanalytics. The sites they identified had nothing in common other than the fact they were all using\ntheir own custom CDN to load various libraries. In effect, the only resulting victims of a\ncompromise on their CDN repository would be themselves.\n\nDragos has reported that XENOTIME, the APT group behind the TRISIS (aka TRITON and\n[HatMan) attack on a Saudi Arabian petro-chemical facility in 2017, has expanded its focus](https://threatpost.com/trisis-physical-destruction-electric-companies/145712/)\nbeyond the oil and gas industries. Researchers have recently seen the group probing the\nnetworks of electric utility organizations in the US and elsewhere – perhaps as a precursor to a\n\n\n-----\n\n[We recently reported on the latest versions of FinSpy for Android and iOS, developed in mid-](https://securelist.com/new-finspy-ios-and-android-implants-revealed-itw/91685/)\n2018. This surveillance software is sold to government and law enforcement organizations all\nover the world, who use it to collect a variety of private user information on various platforms.\nWikiLeaks first discovered the implants for desktop devices in 2011 and mobile implants were\ndiscovered in 2012. Since then Kaspersky has continuously monitored the development of this\nmalware and the emergence of new versions in the wild. Mobile implants for iOS and Android\nhave almost the same functionality. They are capable of collecting personal information such as\ncontacts, messages, emails, calendars, GPS location, photos, files in memory, phone call\nrecordings and data from the most popular messengers. The Android implant includes\nfunctionality to gain root privileges on an unrooted device by abusing known vulnerabilities. It\nwould seem that the iOS solution doesn’t provide infection exploits for its customers: the product\nseems to be fine-tuned to clean traces of publicly available jailbreaking tools. This might imply\nthat physical access to the victim’s device is required in cases where devices are not already\njailbroken. The latest version includes multiple features that we haven’t observed before. During\nour recent research, we detected up-to-date versions of these implants in the wild in almost 20\ncountries, but the size of the customer base would suggest that the real number of victims may be\nmuch higher.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nAPT activity in the Middle East has been particularly interesting this quarter, not least because of\nthe leaks related to alleged Iranian activity. This is especially interesting because one of those\nleaks might have been part of a disinformation campaign carried out with the help of the\nSofacy/Hades threat actor.\n\nIn contrast to earlier periods, when Southeast Asia was the most active region for APTs, the\nactivities we detected this quarter were mainly Korean-related. For the rest of the region, it was a\nmuch quieter quarter.\n\nAcross all regions, geo-politics remains the principal driver of APT activity.\n\nIt is also clear from our FinSpy research that there is a high demand for ‘commercial’ malware\nfrom governments and law enforcement agencies.\n\nOne of the most noteworthy aspects of the APT threat landscape we reported this quarter was\nour discovery of TajMahal, a previously unknown and technically sophisticated APT framework\nthat has been in development for at least five years. This full-blown spying framework includes up\nto 80 malicious modules stored in its encrypted Virtual File System – one of the highest numbers\nof plugins we’ve ever seen for an APT toolset.\n\nAs always, we would note that our reports are the product of our visibility into the threat\nlandscape. However, it needs to be borne in mind that, while we strive to continually improve,\nthere is always the possibility that other sophisticated attacks may fly under our radar.\n\n\n-----",
