Recently, we witnessed the rise of new ransomware family Avaddon. We also examined techniques utilized by some ransomware\nvariants and the industries affected by these attacks. Additionally, we included our latest figures about ransomware families with the most\ndetections, new ransomware families, and the most affected industries and segments.\n\n## Avaddon ransomware\n\n[The new ransomware called Avaddon (detected by Trend Micro as Ransom.Win32.AVADDON.YJAF-A) has been observed at large. A trojan](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Ransom.Win32.AVADDON.YJAF-A)\n[(detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.JS.AVADDON.YJAF-A) downloads the ransomware from malicious sites and runs them on the system.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Trojan.JS.AVADDON.YJAF-A)\n[This has been reported in a series of twitter posts by TMMalAnalyst.](https://twitter.com/tmmalanalyst/status/1270197110768406528)\n\nThe ransomware is propagated through emails with an attachment named IMG{6 random number}.jpg.js.zip that contains a JavaScript file\nnamed IMG{6 random number}.jpg.js.\n\nFigure 1. Sample email for Avaddon campaign\n\nAs seen in the preceding figure, the email body contains a single smiley. The emails for the Avaddon campaign also follow the footsteps of\npast malware campaigns that use particular subjects to spark the curiosity of the users, thus prompting them to open the message and\ndownload the attachment. Most of these emails have photo-related subjects, which might be particularly enticing for users at a time when\ngadgets with built-in cameras have now become widely available:\n\nLook at this photo!\nPhoto just for you\nYou look good here\n\n\n-----\n\no e t s p oto\nI like this photo\nIs this your photo?\nIs this you?\nMy favourite photo\nYou like this photo?\n\nAfter the attachment is downloaded and ran, it uses a PowerShell command and the BITSAdmin command-line tool to download and run the\nransomware payload. After this, the affected users will see that the ransomware has encrypted the files and appended them with the .avdn file\nextension. Users will see that their system desktop’s wallpaper has been automatically changed to an image that states that “all your files have\nbeen encrypted” and refers to the ransom note: “Instruction 270015-readme.html” (following the {Encrypted Directory}\\{random numbers}readme.html format):\n\nFigure 2. User’s wallpaper as modified by the Avaddon attack\n\nThe ransom note gives instructions on how the affected user can recover the encrypted files.\n\nFigure 3. Avaddon ransom note\n\nThis ransomware encrypts files found in the following folders:\n\nProgram Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\nProgram Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\nProgram Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\nProgram Files (x86)\\Microsoft SQL Server\n\nIt adds the following processes that deletes backup copies of the system making it difficult to restore:\n\n\n-----\n\nc e e S O CO / o te act e\nwbadmin DELETE SYSTEMSTATEBACKUP\nwbadmin DELETE SYSTEMSTATEBACKUP -deleteOldest\nbcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled No\nbcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures\nvssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet\n\nIt terminates services and processes, many of which are related to scanning, storing and retrieving files, and scheduling tasks. Below are\nsome examples:\n\nTerminated services:\n\nccEvtMgr\nccSetMgr\nCulserver\ndbeng8\ndbsrv12\nDefWatch\nIntuit.QuickBooks.FCS\nmsmdsrv\nQBCFMonitorService\nQBIDPService\n\nTerminated processes:\n\n360doctor.exe\n360se.exe\naxlbridge.exe\nBCFMonitorService.exe\nCulture.exe\nDefwatch.exe\nfdhost.exe\nfdlauncher.exe\nGDscan.exe\nhttpd.exe\n\nIt terminates itself if the Windows Locale ID is equal to the following:\n\n419 = Russian\n422 = Ukrainian\n\nIt terminates itself if machine is set to the following keyboard layout language:\n\n419 = Russian\n485 = Yakut (Russia)\n444 = Tatar\n422 = Ukrainian\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the technique of avoiding systems from particular countries has similarly been observed in MedusaLocker\nransomware campaigns.\n\n[For a full list of processes and services and for more details about the ransomware, please refer to our report.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/Ransom.Win32.AVADDON.YJAF-A)\n\n## New techniques spotted\n\nIn recent months, there have also been updates on the techniques used by some ransomware variants. For example, Netwalker ransomware\n[can now be run filelessly through reflective dynamic-link library (DLL) injection (aka reflective DLL loading). This technique injects the DLL from](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/netwalker-fileless-ransomware-injected-via-reflective-loading/)\n[memory rather than from disk. Although the technique itself is not novel (it has been previously used to deploy ColdLock ransomware), its use](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/targeted-ransomware-attack-hits-taiwanese-organizations/)\nby Netwalker is new.\n\nAnother notable development is Ragnar Locker’s deployment of virtual machines to evade detection by antivirus software. According to\n[Sophos, this attack vector has never been used with any ransomware type before. In the past, Ragnar Locker exploited managed service](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/05/21/ragnar-locker-ransomware-deploys-virtual-machine-to-dodge-security/)\nproviders or attacks on Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections.\n\n## Manufacturing, logistics, and energy sectors as targets\n\n\n-----\n\na so a e a et es a e bee used to ta get se e a co pa es u de t e a u actu g, og st cs, a d e e gy secto s t e past o t s\nA variant of [Ekans ransomware (detected by Trend Micro as Ransom.Win32.EKANS.D) has been wielded in targeted attacks against](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/06/ekans-strikes-again-honda-and-enel-taken-down-by-ransomware/)\n[manufacturing companies. As observed by Dragos, there is a particular level of intentionality that is evident in the industrial processes](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-and-ics-operations/)\nterminated in past Ekans attacks, making them a threat that organizations with industrial control systems (ICS) should keep an eye out for.\n\n[Nefilim, a ransomware that follows the recent trend of ransomware types that not only encrypt files but also steal data, has been witnessed to](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/updated-analysis-on-nefilim-ransomware-s-behavior)\nattack logistics companies. Investigations into these attacks have led us to uncover more about the recently discovered ransomware’s\nbehavior, particularly with regard to its data theft capabilities. We found out that this data theft begins weeks or even months before the\nransomware is deployed, and that the attacks use several tools (both malicious and non-malicious) to deploy processes and move through the\nnetwork.\n\nIn related news, operators behind Sodinokibi published, on a Tor webpage, 1,280 files of what they claim to be the passport details and other\n[documents of staff members of an electric service provider. A few weeks before this, the ransomware attack struck the company, thereby](https://www.theregister.com/2020/06/01/elexon_ransomware_was_revil_sodinokibi/)\ninterrupting their operations.\n\nOn the other hand, another ransomware which we dubbed as ColdLock (detected by Trend Micro as Ransom.MSIL.COLDLOCK.YPAEA) targeted a region, rather than just a particular industry. Specifically, it launched attacks on [Taiwanese organizations, aiming to target](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/targeted-ransomware-attack-hits-taiwanese-organizations/)\ndatabases and email servers for encryption.\n\n## Ransomware figures for May\n\nFor May, WannaCry emerged as the top ransomware family with 15,496 detections. WannaCry’s retention of the highest number of detections\ncan be attributed to its worm component and its operators’ persistence in trying to propagate the malware regularly. We foresee that\nWannaCry will continue having such a high number of detections until either a new, massive ransomware comes into being, or the sources for\nWannaCry are found and removed.\n\nTrailing behind are Locky with 1,532 detections and Cerber with 392 detections. Indeed, these ransomware families have consistently been on\nthe top three since January of this year. They were also on the top three for last year’s total ransomware detections.\n\nFigure 4. Ransomware families with the most detections (May 2020)\n\nIn the same month, the industries with the most detections were government (1,870), manufacturing (1,599), and healthcare (1,217).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Top industries for ransomware detections (May 2020)\n\nFor segments, enterprise had the highest number of detections with over 18,000. Meanwhile, detections in the consumer segment numbered\nover 4,000, compared with over 1,000 detections in small and medium-sized businesses (SMB).\n\nFigure 6. Top segments for ransomware detections (May 2020)\n\nAs for ransomware families, five new ones were detected in May, including the aforementioned ransomware ColdLock. One of these new\nfamilies is BlueCheeser (detected by Trend Micro as Ransom.MSIL.BLUECHEESER.A), a ransomware family that appends encrypted files\n[with the .himr extension and instructs affected users to pay US$400 to decrypt files.](https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/16965-bluecheeser-ransomware)\n\n\n-----\n\not e s Co o a oc (detected by e d c o as a so 3 CO O OC ), a so o [as Co d](https://www.2-spyware.com/remove-corona-lock-ransomware.html) o dC y s a so a e,\npropagated through coronavirus-themed spam, renames encrypted files with .corona.lock extension. A different ransomware family named\n[PonyFinal (detected by Trend Micro as Ransom.Java.PONYFINAL.A) is a Java-based, human-operated ransomware that targets Microsoft](https://threatpost.com/ponyfinal-ransomware-enterprise-servers/156083/)\nsystems. Lastly, GonnaCry (detected by Trend Micro as Ransom.Linux.GONNACRY.A) is a ransomware that targets Linux systems. Compared\nwith detections in April, the number of new ransomware families detected has decreased.\n\nFigure 7. Number of new ransomware families (January to May 2020)\n\n## Robust defense against ransomware\n\nInterrupted operations, lost data, and the publication of confidential company data are some of the ways that a ransomware attack can put a\ncompany at risk. However, companies can still find ways to protect their organizations from these attacks.\n\n[Here are some of the best practices for users to protect systems from ransomware:](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/best-practices-ransomware)\n\n[Back up files using the 3-2-1 rule.

Through this, malicious files can be run in an isolated environment.
