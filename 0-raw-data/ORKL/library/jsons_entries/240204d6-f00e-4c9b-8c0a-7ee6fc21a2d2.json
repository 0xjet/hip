The most recent attack that you may have heard about occurred in Oldsmar, Florida,\nand involved targeting the chemical feed system. Specifically, the malevolent actor attempted\nto increase sodium hydroxide dosages to very high levels. This was quickly identified as an\nunauthorized intrusion by the system’s plant operator who took quick action to stop the threat\nbefore any public health and safety was compromised.\n\nYou can access the news reports and press conference through the links below to learn\nmore about this specific event, which is currently an active investigation coordinated by the\nFBI with state and local authorities.\n\nhttps://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/hacker-caught-altering-chemicals-in-oldsmarwater-supply-to-damaging-levels/\n\n\n-----\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkXDSOgLQ6M&ab_channel=PinellasSheriff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkXDSOgLQ6M&ab_channel=PinellasSheriff)\n\nPlease remain vigilant, and also be aware that there are many resources and contacts\navailable to you before, during and after any cybersecurity attack.

Here is a\nmore specific description on the events and suggested protective measures.\n\nThe FBI, DHS, US Secret Service, and the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office have issued a\njoint situational report that concerns the water sector. EPA is providing critical information\nfrom this report to the WSCC and GCC for awareness. EPA recommends that all water\nsystems implement the mitigation measures listed at the end of this report where applicable.\n\n**Background**\n\nOn 5 February 2021, unidentified cyber actors obtained unauthorized access, on two\nseparate occasions, approximately five hours apart, to the supervisory control and data\nacquisition (SCADA) system used at a local municipality’s water treatment plant. The\nunidentified actors accessed the SCADA system’s software and altered the amount of\nsodium hydroxide, a caustic chemical, used as part of the water treatment process. Water\ntreatment plant personnel immediately noticed the change in dosing amounts and corrected\nthe issue before the SCADA system’s software detected the manipulation and alarmed due\nto the unauthorized change. As a result, the water treatment process remained unaffected\nand continued to operate as normal.\n\nThe unidentified actors accessed the water treatment plant’s SCADA controls via remote\naccess software, TeamViewer, which was installed on one of several computers the water\ntreatment plant personnel used to conduct system status checks and to respond to alarms or\nany other issues that arose during the water treatment process. All computers used by water\nplant personnel were connected to the SCADA system and used the 32-bit version of the\nWindows 7 operating system. Further, all computers shared the same password for remote\naccess and appeared to be connected directly to the Internet without any type of firewall\nprotection installed.\n\n**Recommended Mitigation**\n\nRestrict all remote connections to SCADA systems, specifically those that allow\nphysical control and manipulation of devices within the SCADA network. One-way\nunidirectional monitoring devices are recommended to monitor SCADA systems\nremotely.\nInstall a firewall software/hardware appliance with logging and ensure it is turned on.\nThe firewall should be secluded and not permitted to communicate with unauthorized\nsources\n\n\n-----\n\nKeep computers, devices, and applications, including SCADA/industrial control\nsystems (ICS) software, patched and up-to-date.\nUse two-factor authentication with strong passwords.\nOnly use secure networks and consider installing a virtual private network (VPN).\n\nImplement an update- and patch-management cycle. Patch all systems for critical\nvulnerabilities, prioritizing timely patching of Internet-connected systems for known\nvulnerabilities and software processing Internet data, such as Web browsers, browser\nplugins, and document readers.\n\n### Additional Resources for\n\nOpen PDF file, 395.81 KB, for Joint FBI-CISA Cybersecurity Advisory on Compromise of\nWater Treatment Facility (PDF 395.81 KB)\n\n## Feedback\n\nDid you find what you were looking for on this webpage? * required\n\nWe will use this information to improve the site.\n\nDo not include sensitive information, such as Social Security or bank account numbers.\n\nYour feedback will not receive a response.\n\nThis form only gathers feedback about the website.\n\n### Thanks, your message has been sent to Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection!\n\nWould you like to provide additional feedback to help improve Mass.gov?\n\n## Survey\n\nTell us more about your experience\nHow much do you agree with the following statements in the scale of 1, Strongly Disagree, to\n5, Strongly Agree?\n\nStrongly Disagree\n\nStrongly Agree\n\nThis page is helpful.\nStrongly Disagree\n\nStrongly Agree\n\n\n-----\n\nThis page is easy to use.\nStrongly Disagree\n\nStrongly Agree\n\nI am confident that I will find the information that I need.\nStrongly Disagree\n\nStrongly Agree\n\nAre you using Mass.gov for professional or personal reasons? * required\n\nIf we have additional questions about your feedback, can we contact you?
