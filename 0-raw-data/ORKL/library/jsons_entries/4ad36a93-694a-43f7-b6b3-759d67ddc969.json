The\nidea is to fool an email recipient into interacting with what they think is a known and trusted\nbrand. Recently, data analysts at INKY began to see a pattern of attacks impersonating\nVerizon, the large U.S.-based telecommunications provider. What made these attacks\ninteresting was their use of mathematical symbols as part of the Verizon logo.\n\nDespite all the money major brands spend on logo design, people are terrible at\nremembering them. This fluke of human nature plays well into the hands of phishers, who\ncan deceive their victims with made-up logos that look about right. Their graphics may be off,\n[but they do the job. It probably helped the phishers that Verizon has changed its logo a](https://1000logos.net/verizon-logo/)\ncouple of times since Bell Atlantic Corporation was renamed Verizon in 2000.\n\nINKY, which provides anti-phishing technology, detected this Verizon impersonation\ncampaign in dozens of fake emails sent from various Gmail addresses during a two-week\nperiod between September 1-13, 2021.\n\n### Quick Takes: Attack Flow Overview\n\n\n-----\n\nType: phishing\nVector: several “freemail\" accounts, newly created web domain\nPayload: malicious link to credential harvesting site\nTechniques: brand impersonation\nPlatform: Office365\nTarget: Microsoft users\n\n### The Attack\n\nAlthough Verizon's current logo makes use of a bright red, asymmetrical “V” after the word\n“Verizon” (which is all lower case in bolded black sans serif), that \"V\" element does look\nrather like a checkmark.\n\nINKY found three fake logo variants in the wild. Each made use of a mathematical symbol for\nthe red element. The three impersonations reproduced that element via:\n\na square root symbol,\na logical NOR operator, and\nthe checkmark symbol itself.\n\nSample emails are shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nAll three types masqueraded as voicemail notifications. Verizon does provide voicemail\nservices, including notifications.\n\nClicking on the button (black or red, depending on the version) prominently displaying the\ntext “Play >” (made up of the word plus a close-angle-bracket character) led to a site that\nappeared to be Verizon's, but was in fact a malicious impersonation. The phishers were\neasily able to steal separate HTML and CSS elements from Verizon’s real site to put together\na custom job that included a correct version of the logo!\n\n\n-----\n\nThe bad guys created and registered the fake site — sd9-08[.]click — via Namecheap\nbarely a month ago, according to a WHOIS lookup. Namecheap has since taken it down. It\nnow has an NXDOMAIN status, which essentially means it doesn't exist anymore.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the bottom of the fake page, targets were invited to “play, listen, or download” their\nvoicemail with Office365 credentials. Using the red “Authenticate with Office365” button led\nto a fake Microsoft login dialog box.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn INKY analyst entered fake credentials into the fake login to assess the site.\n\nThe first attempted login received a response that the password was incorrect. The second\nattempt elicited a bogus error message.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, the credentials were harvested both times on the backend. This pattern, the double\nask, is fairly common. It’s not entirely clear what the phishers are up to, but it's possible that\nthey want the victim to confirm the correctness of the data, or that they hope the victim will\ntry a different account, yielding them two sets of credentials for the price of one.\n\n### Techniques\n\nThe phishers sent phishing emails from Gmail accounts because they were able to pass\nstandard email authentication (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC). The malicious site was brand new\nand presented zero-day vulnerabilities; they had never been seen before and did not appear\nin threat intelligence feeds commonly referenced by legacy anti-phishing tools. Without a\nblemish, this site did not look malicious.\n\n### Recap of Techniques:\n\nBrand impersonation — uses brand elements, in this case Verizon's, in phishing emails\nand a malicious site, which also impersonated Microsoft brand elements\nCredential harvesting — occurs when a victim tries to log into what they think is a real\nMicrosoft site but enters credentials into a form controlled by the phishers\nNewly created domains — are used by phishers to pass most security software tests,\nallowing phishing emails to slip past corporate defenses and into hapless recipients’\ninboxes\n\n\n-----\n\n### Best Practices: Guidance and Recommendations\n\nEmail recipients are advised to be suspicious of voicemail notifications coming from Gmail or\nother free email providers such as Yahoo, AOL, or Hotmail. They should also distrust emails\nthat claim to be from Verizon but come from a Gmail sender.\n\nAlso, in many cases, they can look at the URL of a site that purports to be Verizon to see\nwhether Verizon actually hosts it. This type of analysis will sometimes lead to false positives\nif a large company uses a smaller firm for marketing support.\n\nThey should also be wary if a site asks them to enter Microsoft credentials to view\nnotifications from Verizon (or any other brand).\n\nINKY reported this flurry of phish to Verizon’s [phishing@verizon.com address. Although this](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:phishing@verizon.com)\nparticular campaign is over, anyone receiving a similar email in the future can report it to that\naddress with their name and account, and phone numbers. Verizon also sent INKY a link to a\n[general security question page, where the company addresses the broader scam landscape.](https://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/account-security/overview)\n\n_Fresh Phish examples were discovered and analyzed initially by Bukar Alibe, Data Analyst,_\n_INKY_\n\n[This article is part of our Fresh Phish series, featuring some of our most interesting phish](https://www.inky.com/blog/tag/fresh-phish)\ncaught by INKY.\n\n## About INKY\n\nHeadquartered in College Park, Maryland, INKY leads the industry in mail protection\npowered by unique computer vision, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
