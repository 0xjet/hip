In\n\n 2019, through intelligence gathering, information sharing, and\n\n incident response engagements, Dragos identified a variety\n\n of new and ongoing threats to ICS. The following are the most\n\n concerning to Dragos.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PROLIFERATION OF THREATS\n\n\nCyber threats to ICS are proliferating as adversaries increasingly invest money, time, and talent into the ability to disrupt\ncritical infrastructure. Such targets include oil and gas, electric\npower, and water.\n\n\nCyber threats to ICS are proliferating as adversaries increas-\n\n\npower, and water.\n\n\n-----\n\n**THE ICS LANDSCAPE AND THREAT ACTIVITY GROUPS**\n\n\nDisruptive or destructive attacks on critical infrastructure require significant resources, which\nare increasing across the board as capabilities\nand targeting expand. The proliferation of cyber\nthreats to ICS can be illustrated by the activity\ngroups XENOTIME and MAGNALLIUM.\n\nIn 2019, Dragos identified a change in behavior for XENOTIME, the activity group behind\nthe destructive TRISIS malware. While working\nwith clients across various utilities and regions,\nDragos identified a persistent pattern of activity\nattempting to gather information and enumerate network resources associated with US and\nAsia-Pacific electric utilities.[10] XENOTIME expanded its probing activity to include electric\nutilities, using the same techniques previously\ndeployed against oil and gas entities. Additionally, as identified in previous Dragos reporting,\nXENOTIME has targeted, and in some cases\nsuccessfully compromised, original equipment\n\n\nmanufacturers (OEMs), potentially impacting\nthe entire industrial supply chain.[11]\n\nAlso this year, Dragos identified MAGNALLIUM beginning to target electric, financial, and\ngovernment entities in North America. This behavior coincided with an escalation of political\nand geographic tensions in the Middle East over\nthe summer.[12] The activity demonstrated an expansion of the behavior for the group previously\nfocused on oil and gas entities, largely in or relating to operations in the Middle East.\n\nTHE GROUP USED THE SAME INITIAL\n\nACCESS ATTEMPT TECHNIQUES EX\nHIBITED IN PREVIOUS CAMPAIGNS\n\nAGAINST ENERGY COMPANIES, NAME\nLY PASSWORD-SPRAYING AND PHISH\nING, IN AN EFFORT TO GAIN A FOOT\nHOLD WITHIN COMPANIES.\n\n\n###### It is important to note this behavior is not a\n RECOMMENDED\n shift – rather it is an expansion of targeting SECURITY\n IMPROVEMENT\n for two groups historically focused on the\n\n oil and gas sector.

LIKE IN 2018, DISRUPTIVE IT MALWARE WAS AGAIN A THREAT TO ICS ENTITIES IN 2019.\n\n\n###### INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES GLOBALLY. LIKE IN 2018,\n\n\n###### DRAGOS HAS IDENTIFIED AN UPTICK IN MALWARE\n\n\n###### TO ICS ENTITIES IN 2019.\n\n\n\n[15]\n\n\nThis year the major malware\nfamilies and events included\nLockerGoga, Emotet, and Ryuk\ninfections. Additionally, Dragos\nidentified an increase in new\nIT-based wiper malware activity targeting industrial entities\nin the Middle East. Dragos has\nalso responded to ransomware\nevents impacting ICS environments, underscoring the\npotential threat to operations\nfrom IT-focused malware if it\nbreaches IT/OT boundaries.\n\nLockerGoga ransomware\nfamily first appeared in an incident at French engineering\ncompany Altran Technologies\nin January 2019.[13] In addition\nto two US-based chemical\nmanufacturers likely impacted\nin early March 2019, the most\nnotable impact was to Norway-based Norsk Hydro on\n19 March 2019. The crippling\nevent resulted in prolonged and\ncostly operational impacts.[14]\n\n\n###### INFECTIONS, PARTICULARLY RANSOMWARE, AT\n\n\nThe LockerGoga variant likely used at Hydro encrypted\nall files outside the Windows\ndirectory, instead of just files\nwith typical document extensions. The Hydro variant also\nimplemented various changes\nto make restoration difficult, if\nnot impossible. Thus, Dragos\nclassified LockerGoga as a\ndestructive malware type used\nfor sabotage instead of mere\nransomware. Superficially,\nthis is similar to the NotPetya\n\n\nransomware event from June\n2017, where malware appearing to be ransomware actually\nresulted in system loss due to\nthe inability to recover files.[15]\n\nEmotet first appeared toward\nthe end of 2018, infecting\nmultiple ICS-related entities.\nThroughout 2019, it continued\nto affect businesses, with a\nbrief drop-off over the summer.[16] Emotet is a modular\ntrojan commonly observed\ndeploying Trickbot and Ryuk\nmalware. In February 2019,\nEmotet malware infected a\ndeep draft vessel bound for\nthe Port of New York and New\nJersey which impacted their\nshipboard network (though no\nessential control systems were\nimpacted) according to the US\nCoast Guard.[17] Ryuk affected\nmultiple organizations associated with the aviation industry.\nAccording to publicly available\ndata and information shared\nwith Dragos, attackers used\nRyuk in events involving a US\n\n\nransomware. Superficially, with Dragos, attackers used\nthis is similar to the NotPetya Ryuk in events involving a US\n\n[14]\n\n\n\n[16]\n\n\n\n[13]\n\n\n-----\n\n**THE ICS LANDSCAPE AND THREAT ACTIVITY GROUPS**\n\n\nairport, US airline, Canadian supply chain company, and a Europe-based aviation industry supplier.\nAdditionally, Mitsubishi Canada Aerospace experienced a Ryuk ransomware attack beginning on\nMarch 19 and lasting “weeks,” according to local\nmedia.[18] Ryuk also impacted an unspecified marine\nfacility, disrupting its camera and physical access\ncontrol systems, as well as causing a loss of critical process control monitoring systems, according\nto a December bulletin from the US Coast Guard.[19]\n\nIn June, UK’s National Cyber Security Centre\n(NCSC) warned of ongoing Ryuk ransomware\ncampaigns targeting global organizations. Then in\nOctober, the Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) released an\nadvisory on a widespread malicious email campaign to spread Emotet malware in Australia. The\nAustralian government received dozens of reports\nof confirmed Emotet infections in sectors including\ncritical infrastructure providers and government\nagencies. The ACSC said it was aware of at least\n19 Emotet infections in Australia, some of which\ndeployed the Trickbot malware.[20]\n\nNumerous other malware events disrupted ICS\nentities in 2019. In July, a ransomware attack on\nthe IT systems at Johannesburg, South Africa’s\nCity Power prevented prepaid electricity purchase\nvia online systems, and prevented customers who\nhad previously bought power to load it to their meter boxes;[21] in September, Rheinmetall Automotive\nexperienced an unnamed malware attack that\ndisrupted some production processes;[22] also that\nmonth, a cyber event disrupted production and\n\n\ndistribution at Danish health device manufacturer\nDemant;[23] BitPaymer ramsomware impacted order\nfulfillment and delivery at the automation firm Pilz\nin October;[24] and oil company Petroleos Mexicanos\nexperienced a ransomware attack in November\nthat disrupted the company’s administration, business, billing, and supply chain operations.[25]\n\nGovernment and intelligence organizations frequently publish detailed information on threats to\nbusinesses and citizens alike, providing some valuable visibility into threat trends in various countries.\nHowever, such releases provide a limited view of\nmalicious activity. Dragos performed incident\nresponse cases against a number of IT-focused\nmalware infections at industrial organizations, including a Sodinokibi ransomware infection at an\nICS entity that disabled multiple systems required\nfor control of the affected plant. Such events often\ngo unreported in the public sphere, thus Dragos’\nincident response capabilities and intelligence\ncollection generate additional insights into threat\ntrends like disruptive ransomware.\n\n2019 also saw two new IT-based wiper malware\nstrains targeting energy entities in the Middle\nEast. Dragos discovered KILLGRAVE malware associated with operations against the oil and gas\nindustry in the UAE in July 2019, with likely links\nto the MAGNALLIUM activity group. Additionally, in\nDecember, IBM released public details on a wiper\ncalled ZeroCleare targeting unspecified industrial\nand energy environments in the Middle East.[26] Dragos continues to observe evidence of ZeroCleare\nuse and related variants in the wild.\n\n\nT H E M A L W A R E A N D R A N S O M W A R E I N C I D E N T S L A R G E L Y\n\nT A R G E T E N T E R P R I S E N E T W O R K S .

Additionally, Microsoft[27]\nand security firm Cybereason[28] published\nreports on threat actors targeting telecommunications providers globally.\n\nTelecommunications networks are valuable\ntargets for ICS-targeting attackers. Gaining\naccess to a mobile or satellite network could allow an adversary to interact with upstream and\nmidstream operations that utilize cellular devices or satellite connections for communication,\nmonitoring, and management. Geographically\ndispersed and remote operations – such as\npipeline compressor stations and offshore oil\nwells, or solar or wind farms – often depend on\ncellular or satellite communication networks.\nDragos observed ICS-specific targeting via\n\n\n**THE ICS LANDSCAPE AND THREAT ACTIVITY GROUPS**\n\n###### THIRD-PARTY AND SUPPLY\n\n\n###### CHAIN TARGETING\n\n\ntelecommunications networks indicating activity corresponding to initial access attempts,\nor Stage 1 of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain, trying to\nbridge to Stage 2 capabilities or access.[29]\n\nIn April, media reporting indicated business process and information technology outsourcing\nfirm Wipro, which provides services for various\nICS verticals, allegedly suffered a breach of\ncorporate systems.[30] Adversaries then used\nthis access to launch follow-on attacks against\nWipro clients. Although not directly involved in\nindustrial operations, Wipro products and services – such as the company’s Promax offering\n– are often tied to industrial processes for\ndata collection, processing, and analysis.[31] The\nbreach was one of multiple third-party service\nprovider attacks Dragos and other entities have\nidentified since 2017, highlighted in Dragos’\n2018 Year in Review reporting.[32]\n\n\n###### ENTITIES THIS YEAR. IN 2019, NEW THREATS EMERGED AFFECTING\n\n\n\n[27]\n\n\n\n[30]\n\n\n\n[29]\n\n\n-----\n\n###### External parties routinely have access to operations, \n\n and thus it presents an issue where third-party access\n\n bypasses corporate IT. Multiple related services surrounding\n\n ICS operations – from managing corporate IT through\n\n performing data collection and analysis on industrial\n\n processes – rely on trusted third parties deeply integrated\n\n into the organization’s operations.\n\n RECOMMENDED SECURITY IMPROVEMENT\n\n\nIn April, Cisco Talos revealed a sophisticated DNS\nhijacking campaign called Sea Turtle.[33] It targeted\n40 organizations in 13 countries, primarily national security organizations in the Middle East and\nNorth Africa, and compromised victims included\n“prominent energy organizations.” The goal of the\ncampaign was to steal credentials to access the\nprimary victims’ networks. The attacks began as\nearly as January 2017 and continued through this\nyear.\n\nDNS hijacking is an attack method that could\nbe used to steal sensitive data and obtain legitimate encryption certificates for a target’s domain\nnames by compromising DNS resolution to funnel\ntraffic to a DNS server generally operated by the\n\n\n\n[33]\n\n\nattacker. In this campaign, attackers compromised third-party entities including DNS registries,\ninternet service providers (ISPs), and organizations\naffiliated with DNS infrastructure support to control the targets’ DNS records. DNS hijacking can\nbe a useful technique to gain initial access to any\nnetwork, including industrial organizations.\n\nAN ADVERSARY EXPLOITING TECHNOLO\nGIES FUNDAMENTAL TO INTERNET CON\nNECTIVITY AND GLOBAL COMMUNICATION\n\nIS SIGNIFICANTLY CONCERNING.\n\n\n###### RECOMMENDED SECURITY IMPROVEMENT\n\nManage third-party connections through\npolicy and technical controls including\nICS-specific threat detection, visibility,\nand response to counter both insider\nand external threats posed by these\nconnections.\n\nattacker.

Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from\ncompiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead\nof a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code\njust before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and\nevery line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers\nto run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they\ncan distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many\ndifferent systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpret-\ners shipped as a default with many Linux distributions. In addition to being a\nuseful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters\nmay be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment.\nDue to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to\nbe deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly\nscripting to perform a task.\n\nIN CONTEXT\nWhen CHRYSENE gains code execution on a target host, it may deploy en-\ncoded malware; the executable is decoded and launched via PowerShell\ncommand. PowerShell commands can be deployed by adversaries on Win-\ndows hosts within the ICS environment.\n\n\nfollowing this leak.\n\n\nCHRYSENE\n\n\nCHRYSENE\n\n\nHEXANE\n\n\n\n[48]\n\n\n-----\n\n**THE ICS LANDSCAPE AND THREAT ACTIVITY GROUPS**\n\n#### Ra\n\n###### RASPITE\n\n\n###### DRAGOS FIRST IDENTIFIED RASPITE IN 2018, AND ITS ACTIVITY TO DATE FOCUSES ON INITIAL ACCESS OPERATIONS WITHIN THE ELECTRIC UTILITY SECTOR.

We expect to see more adversaries expand their focus to additional critical infrastructure and industrial environments, which will likely align with activity associated with military or geopolitical conflict. Although defenders continue to gain insight through OT-specific detection and monitoring platforms, it is imperative we continue to improve visibility into activities and threats impacting critical infrastructure.\n\n Although 2019 did not produce a disruptive or destructive attack with an impact like CRASHOVERRIDE or TRISIS, Dragos expects adversaries to be developing such capabilities and will likely leverage them for disruptive effects in the future.\n\n Despite adversaries continuing to evolve and develop their capabilities, Dragos anticipates continued collaboration with our partners, clients, and the community at large to improve cybersecurity awareness and better secure industrial control systems.\n\n In 2020, we plan to continue embodying our mission to safeguard civilization.\n\n\n-----\n\n**THE ICS LANDSCAPE AND THREAT ACTIVITY GROUPS**\n\n###### APPENDIX\n\n\n[1 https://dragos.com/adversaries/](https://dragos.com/adversaries/)\n[2
