The message was part of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaign targeting government officials and economic institutions in Southeast Asia.\n\n### Behavior\n\nThe attachment contained a Rich Text Format (RTF) file that exploited CVE-2014-1761,\nwhich affects multiple Microsoft Word releases and allows remote attackers to execute\narbitrary code via crafted RTF data. Upon exploitation, the RTF file drops the Epdate.exe file\n(MD5: 1c29b24d4d4ef7568f519c470b51bbed) and executes it from the system's %TEMP%\nfolder (see Figure 1). The compilation timestamp of the dropped Epdate.exe file was April 21,\n2014, indicating that it was created the day before the email was sent.\n\n_Figure 1. Cueisfry downloader trojan (Epdate.exe) disguised as Microsoft Access MDB file._\n_(Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nWhen executed for the first time on a victim's computer, Epdate.exe (the Cueisfry trojan)\nchecks for the existence of “AntiVir_Update.URL” in the Startup folder. When that check fails,\nCueisfry writes the file to the Startup folder to allow the malware to maintain persistence and\nautomatically launch with a system restart and across logins. Cueisfry does not communicate\nwith its command and control (C2) server during this initial run. When the victim logs back\n\n\n-----\n\nonto the system, Windows automatically triggers the AntiVir_Update.URL file in the Startup\nfolder. As with its initial run, Epdate.exe checks for the AntiVir_Update.URL file in the Startup\nfolder. Confirming the file's existence, Cueisfry establishes a connection to the hard-coded\nC2 IP address 198.55.103.148. This IP address is still active as of this publication.\n\nUpon execution, Cueisfry checks for proxy settings on the victim's systems by querying the\nHKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet Settings registry key and reading\nvalues for ProxyEnable and ProxyServer. Then it writes information about processes running\non the victim's system to %TEMP%~Proc75C.DAT. After gathering the system's process\ninformation, Cueisfry relays it to the C2 server (see Figure 2).\n\n_Figure 2. Cueisfry communicating to C2 server. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe details of the spearphishing email and dropped Cueisfry malware demonstrate attackers'\nsophistication when targeting high-value organizations. The use of CVE-2014-1761 reveals\nattackers' ability to exploit a newly disclosed vulnerability. Organizations can protect\nthemselves from such attacks by applying security updates as they become available from\nvendors. Organizations should also invest in programs to educate and train employees in\ndetecting and reporting spearphishing attempts.\n\n### Threat indicators\n\nThe threat indicators in Table 1 can be used to detect activity related to the Cueisfry\ndownloader trojan.
