Without subjecting a phone to this technical analysis, it is\nnot possible to conclusively state whether it witnessed an attack attempt or was\nsuccessfully compromised.\n\nNSO Group, the Israeli company which sells Pegasus worldwide, says its clients, are\nconfined to “vetted governments”, believed to number 36. Though it refuses to identify its\ncustomers, this claim rules out the possibility that any private entity in India or abroad is\nresponsible for the infections which The Wire and its partners have confirmed.\n\nThe leaked database was accessed by Paris-based media nonprofit Forbidden Stories and\nAmnesty International and shared with The Wire, Le Monde, The Guardian, Washington\n_Post Die Zeit, Suddeutsche Zeitung and 10 other Mexican, Arab and European news_\norganisations as part of a collaborative investigation called the ‘Pegasus Project’.\n\nForbidden Stories, which\naccessed the data, says it\ncomprises records of phone\nnumbers selected as\ntargets by NSO clients, a\nclaim the company formally\ndenied while conceding that\nits clients might have used\nthese numbers for “other\npurposes”.\n\nA majority of the numbers\nidentified in the list were\ngeographically concentrated in 10 country clusters: India, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary,\nKazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nEach of these countries have been identified in the past by experts at Citizen Lab – a digital\nsurveillance research organisation based out of the University of Toronto that laid the\ngroundwork for WhatsApp’s 2019 lawsuit against the NSO Group – as having been a region\n\n\n-----\n\nof focus for Pegasus operators.\n\nWorking together with the technical lab of Amnesty International, a team of over 80\njournalists coordinated by Forbidden Stories sought to identify and verify the individuals to\nwhom these numbers belong and then conduct a forensic examination of the phones in use\nby them for the period covered by the data, which, in the Indian case was approximately\nmid-2017 to mid-2019.\n\n[Also read: FAQ: On the Pegasus Project’s Digital Forensics](https://thewire.in/tech/faq-pegasus-project-digital-forensics)\n\nThe Indian Telegraph Act and Information Technology Act prescribe procedures that must\nbe followed for lawful interception. Different countries have different laws but the use of\nhacking to deliver surveillance spyware in India by any individual, private or official, is an\noffence under the IT Act.\n\n_The Wire will be revealing the names it has been able to verify under different categories, in_\na step by step fashion with its partners over the next few days.\n\nThe numbers of those in the database include over 40 journalists, three major opposition\nfigures, one constitutional authority, two serving ministers in the Narendra Modi\ngovernment, current and former heads and officials of security organisations and scores of\nbusinesspersons.\n\nThe presence of a number in the database indicates its likely selection as a target for\nsurveillance but whether a phone was actually hacked and infected can only be established\nthrough forensic examination of the device – more easily done if the instrument in question\nis an iPhone.\n\nAmong the numbers in the Pegasus Project database is one that was registered in the\nname of a sitting Supreme Court judge. However, The Wire has not been able to confirm\nwhether the number, which the judge gave up before it was added to the list, was still being\nused by him for WhatsApp and other encrypted messaging apps when the number was\nselected. Until such time as we are able to establish the number’s actual user during the\nperiod in question, we are withholding the name of the judge.\n\n_The Wire and its partners will also not be revealing the identity of any names that appear to_\nbe the subject of counter-terrorism or state-to-state espionage, with the exception of 13\nheads of state or government around the world.\n\n**Committed to privacy rights, says Indian government**\n\nIn a response to detailed questions sent by Pegasus Project partners to the Prime\nMinisters’ Office earlier this week, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology\nsaid that “India is a robust democracy that is committed to ensuring the right to privacy to all\n\n\n-----\n\nits citizens as a fundamental right and that the allegations regarding government\nsurveillance on specific people has no concrete basis or truth associated with it\nwhatsoever.”\n\nWithout specifically denying that Pegasus is being used by the government, the MEITY\nresponse said, “Each case of interception, monitoring, and decryption is approved by the\ncompetent authority… The procedure therefore ensures that any interception, monitoring or\ndecryption of any information through any computer resource is done as per due process of\nlaw.”\n\nAlso read: Old RTI Response Enough To Deny Govt-Pegasus Link, Media Didn’t Do Due\nDiligence: MeitY\n\nIn fact, the procedure for lawful interception involves not just written, time-bound\nauthorisation in each instance but the use of the telecom or computer resource intermediary\nas well, who is supposed to enable the interception, and does not cover the activities\nproscribed by Section 43 of the IT Act under the definition of “hacking”.\n\nHacking an individual’s smartphone is a necessary step in subjecting an individual to\nsurveillance by spyware such as Pegasus.\n\n**NSO says data ‘may be’ linked to its customers**\n\nThough the NSO Group insists the leaked database is “not a list of numbers targeted by\ngovernments using Pegasus”, it told The Wire and Pegasus Project partners in a letter from\nits lawyers that it had “good reason to believe” the leaked data “may be part of a larger list\nof numbers that might have been used by NSO Group customers for other purposes”.\n\nAsked what these “other purposes” could be, the company changed tack and claimed that\nthe leaked records were based on “publicly accessible, overt sources such as the HLR\nLookup service” – and that it had no “bearing on the list of the customer targets of Pegasus\nor any other NSO products”.\n\nHLR lookup services are used to test whether a phone number of interest is currently on a\nnetwork.\n\nAn Appeal: [Support Investigative Journalism That Brings You The Truth. Support The Wire.](https://support.thewire.in/)\n\nIf the leaked numbers represent the output of an HLR Lookup service, as NSO itself\nsuggests, the fact that the data is from countries known to have been a region of focus for\nPegasus operators in the past raises two questions: were they all generated by the same\nservice provider? Were they all consolidated and held in one place for some common\npurpose?\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile HLR lookups have obvious commercial relevance for telemarketers, telecom security\nexperts say they could well be an integral part of spyware-driven surveillance. “Here’s the\nmost important reason why you would use an HLR lookup,” Karsten Nohl, chief scientist for\nSecurity Research Labs in Berlin, told the Pegasus Project. “You would know that the phone\nis on” – and hence available for hacking.\n\nNSO disputes the suggestion that Pegasus could have been used to target 50,000 persons,\nimplying that the scale of targeting across all government clients is around 5,000 a year.\n\nThe sensitivity of the information involved – governments which select high-profile\nindividuals for potential hacking and surveillance would hardly like the details or metadata of\ntheir targeting to be known by a foreign government or private entity – further adds to the\nquestions which the leaked database and NSO’s firm denial that this has any connection to\nPegasus raise.\n\nNone of the governments involved have an incentive to shed light on the issue. However, in\ncountries that are governed by the rule of law, the possibility that a massive and illegal\nsurveillance programme is being used to target prominent individuals from all walks of life –\nincluding political opponents and journalists – poses a clear threat to democracy and will\nraise demands for an independent probe.\n\n_The Pegasus Project is a collaborative investigation that involves more than 80 journalists_\n_from 17 news organisations in 10 countries coordinated by Forbidden Stories with the_\n_[technical support of Amnesty International’s Security Lab.
