Not so much\n\n**[proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/holiday-lull-not-so-much](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/holiday-lull-not-so-much)**\n\n\nJanuary 12, 2018\n\n\n-----\n\n[Blog](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog)\n[Threat Insight](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight)\nHoliday lull? Not so much\n\n\n-----\n\nJanuary 12, 2018 Proofpoint Staff\n\n**Overview**\n\nFor at least the last two years, Proofpoint researchers have observed a seasonal lull in\nactivity around the Thanksgiving holiday and during the weeks between Christmas and\nRussian Orthodox Christmas (January 7). Activity during the Thanksgiving 2017 holiday,\nhowever, was higher than in previous years, with multiple campaigns targeting a variety of\nregions. Examining year-over-year differences in malicious message volumes for the period\nof December 15 through January 12 revealed that, while activity dropped during this period,\nit remained significantly higher than what we observed the previous year and returned to\nnear pre-holiday levels more quickly after January 7 than in 2017.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nFigure 1 shows a year-over-year comparison of message volume for the period of December\n15-January 12. The week leading up to Christmas 2016 had significantly higher volumes\nthan during the same week in 2017, primarily due to Locky ransomware campaigns\ndistributed by TA505. Just before, we observed a slight jump in traffic around Christmas 2017\nrelative to both previous weeks in 2017 and the same week in 2017. Unlike in 2016, some\nactors seemingly worked through that week during which we generally expect very limited\nactivity.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: 2016 vs 2017 volumes for malicious messages during the holidays_\n\nBecause the activities of threat actor TA505 tend to obscure the campaigns of other threat\nactors, breaking down activity during this period by actor gives a better sense of the nature\nand diversity of malware involved in these campaigns over the holidays. The following actors\nwere actively conducting campaigns after December 22, 2017, but were inactive the year\nbefore between December 22, 2016, and January 2, 2017:\n\nTA542 – We began tracking the actors behind Emotet in April of 2017 and as a result, did not\ntrack them during the 2016 holiday season. TA542 campaigns have appeared consistently\nsince they emerged in April and, during the Christmas week, we observed Emotet distributed\nvia URLs that led to malicious Microsoft Word documents with embedded macros used to\ndownload the malware. On at least one occasion during the Christmas week, Emotet also\ndownloaded Zeus Panda. This instance of Zeus Panda primarily targeted online retail sites\nduring the holiday season.\n\nTA505 - [The actors behind the massive Locky and Dridex campaigns of the last two years](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actor-profile-ta505-dridex-globeimposter)\nalso passed up the full two-week Christmas break this year, relying heavily on malicious\nVBScript and JavaScript files in 7-Zip archives to deliver primarily GlobeImposter\nransomware, with two separate large campaigns on December 27 and 28. In early 2017,\nTA505 took a nearly three month hiatus before resuming campaigns; this year, their\ncampaigns resumed on January 11 after less than a two-week break around the Russian\nOrthodox Christmas. It is worth noting that TA505 activity is highly dependent on the Necurs\nbotnet, so some of their quiet periods may relate to botnet disruptions or maintenance.\nHowever, we observed increases in activity from multiple actors this season, suggesting that\nthis is not an artifact exclusively related to TA505 distribution.\n\n\n-----\n\nTA544 – We observed a campaign targeting Japanese users dropping URLZone from\nmalicious Microsoft Excel documents, which eventually led to a final Ursnif payload. This\nwas the first time in several months that we had seen this particular infection chain.\n\nTA543 – We identified another Ursnif campaign, this time targeting Australian users, via\nmalicious Microsoft Word documents during the Christmas season. The campaign utilized a\nfamiliar theme, namely a billing notification lure using stolen branding for a widely recognized\nNew Zealand-based accounting software company.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFor years, threat actors typically avoided sending large, broad-based campaigns on major\nAmerican and UK holidays and weekends. However, that tendency appears to be changing,\nperhaps because of widening geographical targets, attempts to have malspam waiting in\ncrowded inboxes when users return from holidays, or attempts to deliver malware when\ndefenders within organizations are more likely to be out of the office. Moreover, the\nheightened threat actor activity of the 2017-2018 holiday period reflects the broader trend of\n2017 as whole, a year that saw fewer sustained disruptions in campaign activity by major\nthreat actors. Whatever the reason for the change, it appears that some seasonal trends\nmay be shifting such that defenders and end users should be prepared at all times to deal\nwith both high-volume and targeted campaigns across geographies. Of particular note are\ncampaigns from TA505 -- because this actor frequently drives a large percentage of global\nmalicious spam, their much more rapid return to activity following the Russian Orthodox\nChristmas compared to 2016-2017 as well as higher levels of activity around the western\nChristmas holiday at the end of 2017 stands out as a potential indicator of a change in\ntactics.\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
