This includes stealers, clippers, worms, miners, ransomware, and DDoS Bots\nwhich the Threat Actors (TAs) have named ‘Eternity Project.’\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 – Product Information\nUpon further investigation, the TAs also have a Telegram channel with around 500 subscribers, where they\nhave provided information about the malware’s operation and features through detailed videos. The\nTelegram channel also shares information about the malware’s updates, which shows that the TAs are\nactively working to enhance the features of the malware.\n\nFigure 2 – Telegram Channel\nInterestingly, individuals who purchase the malware can utilize the Telegram Bot to build the binary. The\nTAs provide an option in the Telegram channel to customize the binary features, which provides an\neffective way to build binaries without any dependencies.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 – Telegram Builder\n\nThis blog showcases our research on Eternity Project’s malware capabilities and steps to secure yourself\nand your organization accordingly.\n\n### Eternity Stealer\n\nThe developer sells the Stealer module for $260 as an annual subscription. The Eternity Stealer steals\npasswords, cookies, credit cards, and crypto-wallets from the victim’s machine and sends them to the TA’s\nTelegram Bot.\n\nThe features of the stealer malware mentioned on the TAs website and Telegram channel are:\n\nBrowsers collection (Passwords, CreditCards, Cookies, AutoFill, Tokens, History, Bookmarks):\nChrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Chromium, Vivaldi, IE, and +20 more.\nEmail clients: Thunderbird, Outlook, FoxMail, PostBox, MailBird.\nMessengers: Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, Signal, Pidgin, RamBox.\nCold cryptocurrency wallets: Atomic, Binance, Coinomi, Electrum, Exodus, Guarda, Jaxx, Wasabi,\nZcash, BitcoinCore, DashCore, DogeCore, LiteCore, MoneroCore.\nBrowser cryptocurrency extensions: MetaMask, BinanceChain, Coinbase Wallet, and 30+ more.\nPassword managers: KeePass, NordPass, LastPass, BitWarden, 1Password, RoboForm and 10+\nmore.\nVPN clients: WindscribeVPN, NordVPN, EarthVPN, ProtonVPN, OpenVPN, AzireVPN.\nFTP clients: FileZilla, CoreFTP, WinSCP, Snowflake, CyberDuck.\n\n\n-----\n\nGaming software: Steam session, Twitch, OBS broadcasting keys.\nSystem credentials: Credman passwords, Vault passwords, Networks passwords).\n\nFigure 4 demonstrates the steps to build Eternity Stealer malware through the Telegram Bot. Initially, the\nTelegram channel shows available products to users who purchased the malware when they enter a\ncommand /Product.\n\nOnce the users select the stealer product, they are presented with further options for features such as\nAntiVM and AntiRepeat. Finally, the user has the option to select the available payload file extension such\nas .exe, .scr, .com, and pif. After selecting the file extension, the user can download the stealer payload\nfrom the Telegram channel.\n\nFigure 4 – Purchasing and\n\nBuilding Eternity Stealer Payload\nThe stolen information is saved in .txt files, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5 – Stolen Information Saved in .txt files\n\n### Eternity Miner\n\nThe developer sells the Miner module for $90 as an annual subscription. The Eternity Miner is a malicious\nprogram that uses the resources of an infected computer to mine cryptocurrency.\n\nThe features of the miner malware mentioned on the TA’s website and Telegram channel are:\n\nStartup\nSmall size\nSilent Monero mining\nRestart when killed\nHidden from the task manager\n\nFigure 6 demonstrates the steps to build Eternity Miner malware through the Telegram Bot. Here, the users\ncan enter their Monero wallet address and Monero pool URLs while building the binary.\n\nFigure 6 – Building Miner Payload\n\n\n-----\n\n### Eternity Clipper\n\nThe developer sells the clipper malware for $110. The Eternity Clipper is a malicious program that monitors\nthe clipboard of an infected machine for cryptocurrency wallets and replaces them with the TA’s cryptowallet addresses.\n\nThe features of the Clipper malware mentioned on the TA’s website and Telegram channel are:\n\nStartup\nSmall size\nHidden from the task manager\nReporting to Telegram Bot\nPrevents second reporting of replacement to prevent spam\nSupport of multiple address formats for BTC, LTC, ZEC, and BCH\n\nFigure 7 demonstrates the steps to build the Eternity Clipper malware through a Telegram Bot. Here, users\ncan enter their crypto wallet addresses while building the binary.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7 – Eternity Clipper Payload Building\n\n### Eternity Ransomware\n\nThe developer sells the Eternity Ransomware for $490. Eternity Ransomware is a malicious program that\nprevents users from accessing their machine, either by locking the system’s screen or encrypting the users’\nfiles until a ransom is paid.\n\nThe features of the ransomware mentioned on the TA’s website and Telegram channel are:\n\nEncrypts all documents, photos, and databases on disks, local shares, and USB drives.\nOffline encryption (Doesn’t requires network connection)\nUses a very strong algorithm of encryption utilizing both AES and RSA.\nThe ability to set a time limit after which the files cannot be decrypted.\nExecution on a specific date\nCurrently, FUD (0/26)\n\n\n-----\n\nSmall size 130kb\n\nFigure 8 depicts the steps to build Eternity Ransomware through the TA’s Telegram channel. Here, users\ncan enter text to be shown once the victims open an encrypted file. The TAs can mention the ransom notes\nand payment details etc., for further communication with victims.\n\nAdditionally, users have the option to enter the time limit for the ransom payment. If victims fail to pay the\nransom within the time limit, the encrypted files can’t be decrypted. This is set as a default feature while\ncompiling ransomware binary.\n\nFigure 8 – Ransomware\n\nPayload Building\nFigure 9 shows the Eternity Ransomware Decryption window when users open an encrypted file.\n\nFigure 9 – Eternity Ransomware\n\nDecryption Window\n\n\n-----\n\n### Eternity Worm\n\nThe developer sells the Eternity Worm for $390. It is a virus that spreads through infected machines via\nfiles and networks. The features of the worm dropper malware mentioned on the TA’s website and\nTelegram channel are:\n\nUSB Drives\nLocal network shares\nLocal Files (py, zip, exe, bat, jar, pdf, Docx, xlsx, pptx, mp3, mp4, png)\nCloud Drives (GoogleDrive, OneDrive, DropBox)\nPython Interpreter (Injects worm loader into all compiled python projects)\nDiscord Spam (Sends your messages to all channels and friends)\nTelegram Spam (Sends your messages to all channels and contacts)\n\nFigure 10 depicts the steps to build Eternity worm malware through the TAs Telegram channel. Here, users\ncan provide the URL where the worm payload will be located and also provide direct download URLs to\ndownload the worm payload. Eternity Worm can infect local files and spread through Discord and Telegram\nchannels.\n\nFigure 10 – Worm\n\nMalware Building\nThe below image shows the malware spreading via Discord.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11 –\n\nDiscord Account\n\n### Eternity DDoS Bot\n\nAccording to the TA’s website, the DDoS Bot malware is currently under development.\n\n[We suspect the developer behind the Eternity project is leveraging code from the existing Github repository](https://github.com/L1ghtM4n/DynamicStealer)\nand then modifying and selling it under a new name.\n\n[Our analysis also indicated that the Jester Stealer could also be rebranded from this particular Github](https://blog.cyble.com/2022/02/24/jester-stealer-an-emerging-info-stealer/)\nproject which indicates some links between the two Threat Actors.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCyble Research Labs has observed a significant increase in cybercrime through Telegram channels and\ncybercrime forums where TAs sell their products without any regulation. We have encountered the Eternity\nproducts being sold on one such Telegram channel and TOR website.\n\nCyble will continue to monitor Eternity Project’s products and update our readers with the latest\ninformation.\n\n## Our Recommendations\n\nWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against\nattackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:\n\n### Safety measures needed to prevent malware attacks\n\nConduct regular backup practices and keep those backups offline or in a separate network.\n\n\n-----\n\nTurn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected\ndevices wherever possible and pragmatic.\nUse a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected devices, including\nPC, laptop, and mobile.\nRefrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their authenticity.\n\n## Indicators Of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n\n**Indicators** **Indicator**\n**type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n**8d52a66459df0ea387d5aab3fc7a2bc9** MD5 Eternity\nStealer\nPayload\n\n**1707b034483eb9f279dfaa3a8862592bddb2ac4e** SHA1 Eternity\nStealer\nPayload\n\n**eb812b35acaeb8abcb1f895c24ddba8bb32f175308541d8db856f95d02ddcfe2** SHA256 Eternity\nStealer\nPayload\n\n**c4b46a2d0898e9ba438366f878cd74bd** MD5 Eternity\nClipper\nPayload\n\n**f95a0529fbb8aa61cd3dee602fa6555b2c86dd62** SHA1 Eternity\nClipper\nPayload\n\n**025e74a98cb22aab0eb2dbff69cb5abd4f1d529925d9e456f92f5fd6ff1e11c3** SHA256 Eternity\nClipper\nPayload\n\n**76c5b877fb931ed728df30c002bf8823** MD5 Eternity\nRansomware\nPayload\n\n**16a8a21ef1a30849bedc514e42286de7676db5af** SHA1 Eternity\nRansomware\nPayload\n\n**55bf0aa9c3d746b8e47635c2eae2acaf77b4e65f3e6cbd8c51f6b657cdca4c91** SHA256 Eternity\nRansomware\nPayload\n\n**b35aa57c5c963bde7abee2a4e459b146** MD5 Eternity\nWorm\nPayload\n\n**e0817176fa7e1875a5d301b47d9a9a6977c39da5** SHA1 Eternity\nWorm\nPayload\n\n\n-----\n\n**656990efd54d237e25fdb07921db3958c520b0a4af05c9109fe9fe685b9290f7** SHA256 Eternity\nWorm\nPayload\n\n\n-----",
