    "plain_text": "# SPM55: Ascending the Ranks of Indonesian Phishing As A Service Offerings\n\n**[domaintools.com/resources/blog/spm55-ascending-the-ranks-of-indonesian-phishing-as-a-service-offerings](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/spm55-ascending-the-ranks-of-indonesian-phishing-as-a-service-offerings)**\n\n## Who is SPM55?\n\nAlthough SPM55 is a relative newcomer to the Indonesian cybercrime community, a marked\nuptick in activity and known customers over the last several months suggests this group\nseeks to scale their business operation, possibly in response to the collapse of competing\nIndonesia-based phishing vendors.\n\nSPM55 offerings target a number of popular services, technology companies, and financial\ninstitutions. Some examples include Coinbase, Netflix, Amazon, and Ebay. Another\nnoteworthy characteristic of SPM55 is their willingness to pivot rapidly based on customer\nfeedback and expand their customer base by releasing new phishing kits quickly. Further,\nSPM55 offers a la carte credit card checkers and account validators which are frequently\nused for phished credential and payment data validation. Another add-on is an “antibot”\nservice which SPM55 resells. In this context, such service reduces automated detection\nrates and thwarts security vendors by identifying and redirecting sessions to innocuous\nwebsites if a session appears to be inauthentic–that is, a session not belonging to a valid\nphishing target.\n\n\n-----\n\nSPM55 phishing pages and custom lures appear to focus on the typical your account is\ndisabled” types of phishing page, and support not only fields for account credentials, but\nalso what is commonly known in cybercrime communities as “fullz” or “full personal\ninformation” which can be used to commit several types of fraud.\n\nWritten in PHP and bearing a strong resemblance to–and at times outright copying–those\noffered by cracked versions of 16Shop and Young Sister, SPM55’s phishing kits and\nmanagement panel are of above-average quality and have higher than average success\nrates compared to other phishing kits. Based on customer preference, deployed and\nproperly licensed phishing kits send victim data to operators via email or Telegram. Notably,\ncredential processing appears to send victim information to a SPM55-controlled\nmanagement server as well, likely providing SPM55 with copies of the credentials stolen by\ntheir customers. Siphoned data is likely sold or used for fraudulent purposes by SPM55\nadministrators. In short, SPM55 may scam their own customers. Because stolen credentials\nand personal information are also likely siphoned to SPM55 administrators, the risk of harm\nfrom such phishing activity at the hands of a competent cybercriminal is likely to be severe.\n\n## Behind SPM55\n\nSPM55 operates out of Indonesia and its owner-admin uses the handle “AlexID” (among\nothers). While AlexID is not the only SPM55 administrator, they appear to run the\norganization, as suggested by some of the earliest posts advertising the service which list\nthem as the owner of SPM55 as well as developer comments addressed to “Alex”\nproposing how to approach technical questions.\n\n\n-----\n\nIncreasingly suspicious of outsiders, this group is somewhat hesitant to do business with\nnon-Indonesian speakers, much like how Russian cybercrime groups use idiomatic\nlanguage as a kind of screening mechanism for prospective customers. SPM55 prefers\npayments using two Indonesian payments services, OVO and DANA, though they also\naccept Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even with this seemingly cautious approach to onboarding\n\n\n-----\n\nclients, the kits have found a receptive market and intelligence suggests customer accounts\nnumber in the several hundreds of active users with a sharp recent uptick in new\ncustomers.\n\n## Infrastructure Associated With SPM55 and Actors\n\nWhile some infrastructure associated with SPM55 is hosted in Indonesia, the client base\ncuts a wide swath across the globe with customers identified across in Nigeria, Pakistan,\nand other geographies also historically associated with phishing activity. In keeping with\nmany such actors, there is a mix of both conventional domains registered for phishing\nattacks, as well as a strong reliance on dynamic DNS providers, given the ease with which\nsuch domains can be provisioned and the relatively lower cost and effort associated with\nabusing such services. We have included a set of IOCs related to SPM55 campaigns which\nhighlight these and given the rate of recidivism of many SPM55 actors, pivots within\n[registration information and passive DNS using Iris Investigate shows an even broader](https://www.domaintools.com/products/iris-investigate?utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=SPM55)\narray of activity related to such actors.\n\nPhishing remains to be the most common vector for account takeover and account fraud\nactivity for many large organizations, contributing to significant financial losses as well as\ndamage to brands as customers feel the impact of being victimized by these criminal\nservices. Given their prevalence, continued evolution, and nexus of activity in the phishingas-a-service marketspace, SPM55 is a criminal service worth keeping an eye on to help\ndefend organizations and their customers against.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nFor companies and brands impacted by these phishing kits, monitoring for lookalike\ndomains through solutions like DomainTools Detect can be an effective way of identifying\nand disrupting campaign infrastructure. The same applies to companies and brands that\nmay become targets of this group in the future, given their frequent targeting pivots based\non customer demand.\n\n\n-----\n\nUse of passive DNS data is also helpful in identifying other domains used by actors to\nconduct this activity, including historical activity that may not have been previously observed\nto determine the rate of recidivism against a brand.\n\nSubmitting offending domains to Google Safe Browsing and other similar services can help\nprevent user and customer account fraud from compromised credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nonduties[.]com\neccoinbase[.]com\nycoinbase[.]com\ntomlem[.]co[.]ke\nrecoveryaccount-alertcoinbaseconfirmation[.]4pu[.]com\nnugroho-uwu[.]duckdns[.]org\njob[.]oneplacement[.]com\nverify-coinbase[.]cloudns[.]cl\nusamanaeem[.]tech\nsourcesexplore[.]com\ndryousry[.]com\nmultandha[.]com\nschooltv[.]in\nthebonbon[.]hopto[.]org\nuyoushop[.]com\nwww[.]siav[.]app\nseuidcnetf[.]hopto[.]org\nhelp[.]coinbaseaccsecruyh[.]com\nhttps://voilas-store[.]com/\naccountservices[.]sadte[.]net\nheronationusa[.]com\nsecuritycenter[.]name\ntest[.]zedtunefied[.]com\nupdate[.]inteksplus[.]rs\nauthcoinbase[.]com\ntheabrasivepad[.]com\nsecurerobinhood[.]com\nivenmo[.]com\nRobinhood-help[.]com\nupgradeservices[.]online/\nservisess[.]com\nrecover-robinhood[.]com\nactservc[.]com\ncs-coiinbase[.]com\namzonconfirmaccountactivityupdate[.]ednbkxv[.]com\nindra-ganteng[.]duckdns[.]org\njalanjalan[.]ddnsking[.]com\nmovismaps[.]com\nhttps://naireport[.]com/\nservice-robinhooddsupportacount[.]duckdns[.]org\nferdiesoccermagic[.]com\nwww[.]kotapride[.]in\nrcchilddevelopmentcentre[.]com\nupdate-id-check[.]online\nmyproject[.]zzux[.]com\nngetes-sc-spm55[.]duckdns[.]org\nhttps://www[.]fngs[.]in/\namazonsmilee[.]sytes[.]net\nserv-actservicebilnaire[.]com\naptserv-sikat[.]com\nsecure-chasebanks[.]com\nspm55-gadakobat[.]duckdns[.]org\ntesbroo[.]com\nhegar[.]com[.]mx\ngetazkaweb[.]com\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nymailinfounusual[.]duckdns[.]org\nsport5jarilah[.]duckdns[.]org\nconfirm[.]amz[.]update[.]account-id[.]sicrn[.]valid[.]database[.]uknowninformation[.]iknasuf83g[.]co\nmail-robinhoodsvice[.]servequake[.]com\njrcivils[.]co[.]uk\namazonservicesweb[.]myvnc[.]com\ndemo-robinhood[.]wikaba[.]com\ncainbesecok[.]robin03[.]biz\nrevard[.]uz\nauth-accounts-settings-policy[.]com\nresolution-center-regarding-access[.]com\nverify-identitycb[.]ddns[.]net\naccoun-verifycb[.]ddns[.]net\nverify-authsignin[.]duckdns[.]org\nap-robinhoodseic[.]servequake[.]com\nidentification-cb[.]ddns[.]net\nencrypt3d[.]com[.]mx\nsecureappmailamzon[.]servequake[.]com\nrobbb[.]ddnsking[.]com\npen[.]serveftp[.]com\napp-amznemailuseras[.]servequake[.]com\nauth-restore-restricted-access[.]com\nbe-amzonseacureappmaile[.]serveuser[.]com\nveri1fyacc0ount4amz[.]ns02[.]us\namzu-supporterervis[.]duckdns[.]org\nweb-apps[.]amazon[.]infosystem[.]cl\namazonfullupdate[.]serveuser[.]com\namzonaccounverif[.]serveusers[.]com\ndontredagain[.]duckdns[.]org\ncoinbase[.]usps-care[.]us\nforyoumeadlind[.]001www[.]com\nredflagkntl[.]duckdns[.]org\nem-suppsecureamz0neas[.]edns[.]biz\nsecure05c-chseonline[.]duckdns[.]org\ncha-mailteamamzonea[.]serveuser[.]com\nwww3-pypalservice-resolvecenter[.]duckdns[.]org\nmakananenak[.]hopto[.]org\n\n```\n\n-----",
