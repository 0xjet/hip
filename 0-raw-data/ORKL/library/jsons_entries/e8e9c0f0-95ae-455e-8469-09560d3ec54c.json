Originally, this\nransomware would append a variation of the .djvu string as an extension to encrypted files, but a\nrecent variant has switched to the .tro extension.\n\nWhen first released, it was not known how the ransomware was being distributed and a sample of the\nmain installer could not be found. When discussing the infection with the numerous victims who\n[reported it in our forums and elsewhere, a common theme was noted; most of the victims stated that](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/688201/djvu-ransomware/)\nthey became infected after downloading a software crack.\n\n\n-----\n\n[This campaign has been very successful, with ID-Ransomware reporting numerous victims submitting](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/)\nfiles to their system on a daily basis.\n\n**ID-Ransomware Submissions**\nThe good news is that it may be possible to receive help in recovering your files for free. If you are\n[infected with STOP Ransomware (.djvu, .tro, or .rumba), please see this post about using Michael](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/671473/stop-ransomware-tro-djvu-rumba-openmetxt-support-topic/?p=4667165)\nGillespie's decryptor.\n\nIf that fails to help, then please register an account and post the following information in a new reply to\n[our dedicated STOP Ransomware Support & Help topic:](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/671473/stop-ransomware-tro-djvu-rumba-openmetxt-support-topic/)\n\nNetwork card's MAC address. This can be gotten from using the command getmac /v. If you are\nnot sure which MAC address to use, feel free to copy the entire output.\n[A link to two encrypted files. You can use the Wetransfer service for this.](https://wetransfer.com/)\nYour personal ID from the ransom note.\n\nAfter you submit this information, we will try and help you, but please be patient..\n\nIf you have any questions or need help, feel free to ask here or in our dedicated STOP Ransomware\nSupport and Help topic.\n\n## How the Djvu Ransomware encrypts a computer\n\nCertain cracks and adware bundles are installing this ransomware onto victim's computers. When\nthese cracks are installed, the main installer will be installed as %LocalAppData%\\[guid]\\[random].exe\nand executed. This program is the main ransomware component and will first download the following\nfiles to the same folder:\n```\n%LocalAppData%\\[guid]\\1.exe\n%LocalAppData%\\[guid]\\2.exe\n%LocalAppData%\\[guid]\\3.exe\n%LocalAppData%\\[guid]\\updatewin.exe\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nWhen executed, 1.exe will execute various commands that remove the definitions for Windows\nDefender and disable various functionality. This executable will also execute a PowerShell script called\nScript.ps1, which disabled Windows Defender's real-time monitoring using this command:\n```\nSet-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true\n\n```\nThe ransomware will then execute 2.exe, which adds numerous security sites and download sites to\nthe Windows HOSTS file so that victims are unable to connect to them for help. BleepingComputer is\none of the sites added to the HOSTS file as shown below.\n\n**HOSTS File**\nA file called 3.exe will then be executed, which we have not been able to find a sample of, so are\nunsure as to what it does.\n\nDuring this process, the ransomware will generate a unique ID for the machine, which according\nto [Michael Gillespie is a MD5 of the system's MAC address, and connect to it's Command & Control](https://twitter.com/demonslay335)\nserver at the url http://morgem[.]ru/test/get.php?pid=[machine_id]. The server would then reply back\nwith the encryption key that should be used to encrypt a victim's files.\n\nIf you are using sflow, netflow, or sniffing traffic on your network then it may be possible to recover\nyour encryption key when the C2 server sends it to the victim's computer.\n\nThe ransomware will now begin to encrypt the files on the computer and at the same time execute the\nupdatewin.exe. Updatewin.exe will display a fake Windows Update screen in order distract the user\nwhile their files are being encrypted and to make it seem normal that disk activity has increased.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fake Windows Update**\n\nDuring encryption, the ransomware will encrypt almost all files on the computer, including executables.\nWhen encrypting files, the older variant would append a variant of the string .djvu to the encrypted\nfile's name. For example, test.jpg would be encrypted and then renamed to test.djvu, test.djvus, or\ntest.djvut.\n\nNewer variants are instead appending the .tro extension to encrypted file's names as shown by the\nimage below.\n\n**Encrypted TRO Files**\nFinally, the ransomware will create a scheduled task named \"Time Trigger Task\". This task will launch\nthe ransom at various intervals in order to encrypt any new files that are created.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Scheduled Task**\nWhile encrypting files, it will drop ransom notes named _openme.txt in each folder that files are\nencrypted. This ransom note will contain information regarding what happened to the victim's files and\ntwo email addresses that they should contact in order to receive payment instructions.\n\n**Djvu Ransom Note**\nAs previously stated, if you are infected with this ransomware, then it may be possible to recover your\nfiles for free.
