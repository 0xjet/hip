Intel 471 has learned that authorities targeted the\npurported ring leaders, as well as associates who helped run the related affiliate programs.\nEgregor is responsible for hundreds of ransomware attacks against high-profile targets\n[worldwide since September 2020. According to law enforcement, over 150 companies have](https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/sbu-zablokuvala-diialnist-transnatsionalnoho-khakerskoho-uhrupovannia)\nbeen hit by Egregor, resulting in losses of more than US$80 million.\n\nThe raid has hit Egregor hard. Following the law enforcement action, Egregor’s blog, used to\nshame victims that didn’t pay ransoms, was taken offline. Additionally, one of the associates\nappears to have deactivated his profile on one of the most popular forums on the\ncybercriminal underground.\n\nWhile not confirmed by law enforcement, the arrests point to links between the Egregor\noperations and the Maze ransomware gang. In the late stages of 2020, Maze announced it\nwas shutting down, with operations shifting to Egregor. It is widely believed among threat\nintelligence professionals that a large portion of the affiliates that were attached to Maze\nfollowed the move to Egregor. Members of those affiliate programs were either raided or\narrested last week.\n\n[It is unclear how many people were targeted in the raid, but several Ukrainian press releases](https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-zablokuvala-diialnist-transnatsionalnoho-khakerskoho-uhrupovannia)\nsay the “organizer” was arrested. Intel 471 will continue to watch how the greater cybercrime\nunderground reacts to the actions taken by law enforcement.\n\n\n-----",
