For the second consecutive year, we have included insights from our\n\n FireEye as a Service (FaaS) teams. FaaS monitors organizations 24/7, which gives\n\n them a unique perspective into the current threat landscape. Additionally, this year we\n\n partnered with law firm DLA Piper for a discussion of the upcoming changes in EMEA\n\n data protection laws.\n\n\n-----\n\n**4** M-TRENDS 2017\n\n###### When it comes to attack trends, we are seeing a much higher degree of sophistication than ever before. While nation-states\n Executive\n continue to set a high bar for sophisticated cyber attacks, some financial threat actors have caught up to the point where we no\n Summary\n longer see the line separating the two. Financial attackers have improved their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to the point where they have become difficult to detect and challenging to investigate and remediate.\n\n\n-----\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY **5**\n\n\nWhile financial threat actors have come a long\nway with the tools they use and how they use\nthem, they have shown innovation in other areas\nas well. Perhaps the most unexpected trend\nwe observed in 2016 is attackers calling targets\non the telephone to help them enable macros\nin a phishing document or obtain the personal\nemail address of an employee to circumvent\ncontrols protecting corporate email accounts.\nTo compound the issue, threat groups have also\nshown increased sophistication when it comes to\nescalating privileges and maintaining persistence.\n\nAlthough our investigations show that interbanking networks are particularly attractive to\nfinancial threat groups, we also saw plenty of\nactivity in 2016 involving the use of malware to\ndrain ATMs of cash.\n\nWhile there has been a marked acceleration of both\nthe aggressiveness and sophistication of cyber\nattacks, defensive capabilities have been slow\nto evolve and respond. We have observed that a\nmajority of both victim organizations and those\nworking diligently on defensive improvements\nare still lacking fundamental security controls\nand capabilities to either prevent breaches or to\nminimize the damages and consequences of an\ninevitable compromise. Based on our observations\nof trends from the past several years, organizations\nmust adopt a posture of continuous cyber security,\nrisk evaluation and defensive adaptation or they\nrisk significant gaps in both fundamental security\ncontrols and – more critically – visibility and\ndetection of targeted attacks.\n\nSophisticated intelligence integration, automation,\nand threat hunting should be the end-state goal\nfor organizations facing significant business\nrisks and exposure to cyber attacks. In 2016, we\nobserved a rise in companies either exploring\nor implementing such capabilities, which were\nonce limited to government and global financial\nservices organizations. The trend toward enabling\nthese proactive security operations is one we\nencourage and endorse, but businesses must not\nlose focus of the foundational security functions\nthat both reduce overall cyber risks and enable\nthe defensive operations to operate effectively\n\n\nand efficiently. With an increased willingness of\nboth nation-state and financial threat actors to\noperate increasingly blatant business disruption,\nextortion, and public disclosure attacks,\nfundamental protections such as data and key\napplication segregation, network segmentation,\nand continuous visibility and monitoring of\ncritical systems have returned to prominence\nand should remain a primary focus for many IT\nand security teams.\n\nFireEye believes in an intelligence-led approach\nto security, and this focus applies to many of the\ndefensive trends outlined in M-Trends® 2017. CIOs,\nCISOs and security teams have somewhat become\nvictims of their own successes. With increased\ninvestments in security tools and technologies,\nteams have become overwhelmed with alerts and\ndata and are struggling to prioritize and find the\nsignal in the noise. Cyber defensive operations\nand investigations, leveraging intelligence, and\nautomation and orchestration can convert manual\nand time intensive functions into streamlined\ncourses of action that are presented to an analyst\nin a prioritized manner based on predetermined\ncriticalities and business impacts. These types of\nuse case “mechanizations,” combined with accurate\nand timely intelligence, can save thousands of\nperson-hours of tedious work and enable analysts\nto focus on investigating and remediating the\ncompromises that truly matter.\n\nIn addition to enhancing defensive detection\nand response functions, threat intelligence is the\ncritical component that enables a truly proactive\nsecurity posture and a threat hunting function.\nCyber threat intelligence allows organizations to\ndevelop and maintain a baseline threat profile.\nThis threat profile is the data-driven mechanism\n(as opposed to fear, uncertainty, and doubt) that\ninforms the business and the security teams of the\nmost likely who, what, where, when, and how of\nattacks and the best way to begin looking for them.\nBy constantly assuming compromise in the most\nlikely areas of the infrastructure, organizations can\nfocus their hunting and provide an accurate and\nfactual answer to the question at the top of every\nexecutive’s mind: “Am I compromised?”\n\n\n-----\n\n**6** M-TRENDS 2017\n\n###### By The Numbers PROVIDED BY FIREEYE iSIGHT INTELLIGENCE\n\nINDUSTRIES INVESTIGATED\n\nAMERICA APAC EMEA\n\n\nTOTAL INDUSTRIES\nINVESTIGATED\n\nRetail and Hospitality\n\nNonprofit\n\nMedia and Entertainment\n\n\nTransportation and Logistics\n\n\nConstruction and Engineering\n\n\n-----\n\nBY THE NUMBERS **7**\n\n###### 47%\n\n\nNOTIFICATION SOURCES\nTOTAL\n\nDWELL TIMES\n\n\nEXTERNAL\n\nINTERNAL\n\n\n###### 53%\n\n 99\n\n**MEDIAN**\n\n**350**\n\nEMEA **300** APAC\n\n**250**\n\n**200** **172**\n\n**150**\n\n**100**\n\n**50**\n\n**0**\n\n**MEDIAN**\n\nThis year we have seen a marked decrease in\nthe average dwell time in the EMEA and APAC\nregions.

The attackers did not\nhide their actions and did not demonstrate an\nintent to maintain access to an environment once\ndetected. The attacks were loud and recovery\nwas straight forward. The targets were largely\nopportunistic, the tools rudimentary and the\nskill of the attacker – in all but a few cases –\nwas limited. We often advised our consultants\npreparing to investigate financial attackers for\nthe first time: “The case will be straight forward.\nThe tools are noisy – often scripting languages\nconverted to compiled code with tools such as\nPerl2Exe, which will generate a lot of forensic\nartifacts and makes the attacker activity stand out.\nYou will block a few IP addresses, and the attack\nwill be over.”\n\nAs early as 2013, we began to speak publicly\nabout witnessing a rise in the sophistication of the\nfinancial attacker. Mandiant investigations from\n2014 (discussed in M-Trends® 2015), showed that\n“the lines are blurring between run-of-the-mill\ncyber criminals and advanced state-sponsored\n\n\nattackers”. However, the maturation at the time\nwas modest. Attackers used compiled binaries\nmore often (less Perl2Exe) and they started to\nmaintain a larger command and control (CnC)\ninfrastructure designed to allow the attackers to\npersist following a modest eradication event.\n\nToday, the line between the level of sophistication\nof certain financial attackers and advanced statesponsored attackers is not just blurred – it no\nlonger exists. In 2016, financial attackers moved\nto custom backdoors with a unique configuration\nfor each compromised system, further increased\nthe resilience of their CnC infrastructure, and\nemployed improved counter forensic techniques.\n\nWhile state-sponsored attackers will continue\nto set the bar for capabilities and sophistication,\nfinancial attackers can no longer be categorized\nas smash and grab. An attacker that is harder to\ndetect, investigate and remediate is inherently\nmore likely to remain in an environment to\naccomplish their mission, which means the theft of\ngreater volumes of financial information.\n\n\nFigure 1 below illustrates the increase in sophistication of financial attackers we have seen over the\npast three years.\n\n**Figure 1.

The tool allowed\nincreased sophistication through the use of attackers to obtain elevated privileges in\nnew tools and exploit techniques. A privilege environments where the initially compromised\nescalation tool was identified during a number user did not have them. Figure 6 shows an\nof investigations, though seldom used. The excerpt from a FireEye blog post which\ntool leveraged CVE-2016-0167, a previously explained the privilege escalation technique.¹\n\n**Figure 6.**\nAttacker privilege\nescalation technique.\n\n\n-----\n\n**14** M-TRENDS 2017\n\nMaintain Persistence\nTo ensure continued access to victim\norganizations, the attackers avoided\nreputational scoring built into web proxy and\nIDS/IPS solutions. This was done by storing\nbackdoors and tools on legitimate sites, some\nhosted by vulnerable hosting providers or code\nrepositories such as GitHub. Unfortunately,\nwith sites such as GitHub, the connection is\nSSL encrypted, so in addition to being hosted\non a legitimate site the payload is encrypted,\npreventing deep packet inspection.\n\n\nAttackers also took counter-forensic measures\nto further hide their presence and impair\ninvestigations. Figure 7 is an excerpt from a\nbatch script used by a financial attacker to delete\nPrefetch entries, clear Microsoft Windows event\nlogs and securely delete a file. The batch script\nwas run to hide the execution of malware that was\nscraping payment card information from memory.\nThe technique is simple, but the attacker’s\nconcern for and knowledge of forensic artifacts\ndemonstrated increased sophistication, as well as\ntheir intent to persist in the environment.\n\n\n**Figure 7.**\nBatch script\nto hide malware\nexecution.\n\n\ndel /f /q /s %windir%\\prefetch\\*\n\nreg delete “HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\ShellNoRoam\\MUICache” /va /f\n\nreg delete “HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\ShellNoRoam\\MUICache” /va /f\n\nreg delete “HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\Local Settings\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Shell\\MuiCache” /va /f\n\nreg delete “HKLM\\Software\\Classes\\Local Settings\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Shell\\MuiCache” /va /f\n\nreg delete “HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\RunMRU” /va /f\n\nreg delete “HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\UserAssist” /va /f\n\nwmic nteventlog where LogFileName=’File Replication Service’ Call ClearEventlog\n\nwmic nteventlog where LogFileName=’Application’ Call ClearEventlog\n\nwmic nteventlog where LogFileName=’System’ Call ClearEventlog\n\nwmic nteventlog where LogFileName=’PowerShell’ Call ClearEventlog\n\nren %1 temp000 & copy /y %windir%\\regedit.exe temp000 & del temp000\n\n\nThe most significant evidence that the\nsophistication of financial attackers had left\nthe realm of smash and grab was their use of\npersistence mechanisms such as Volume Boot\nRecord (VBR) modification. This persistence\nmechanism allowed attackers to load their\nbackdoor prior to the operating system. This\nenabled them to hide their backdoors and\ntools from investigative tools reliant upon the\nMicrosoft Windows API. This marks a change as\ntargeted attackers have often relied on the host\noperating system for persistence due to its ease\nof use and stability. The downfall of relying on\nthe host operating system for persistence was\nthat it created forensic artifacts that make even\nthe most sophisticated backdoors detectable\nusing indicators of compromise (IOCs) or\n\n\nhunting techniques. VBR modification does not\nhave this drawback. While VBR modification\nwas sparingly used at the beginning of 2016,\nby the end of the year it had become the\nattacker’s go-to method for maintaining access\nto some environments. In one environment,\nthe sole persistence mechanism used was VBR\nmodification, making the backdoors loaded by\nthe VBR modification extremely difficult to find.\n\n\n-----\n\nATTACK TRENDS **15**\n\n\n###### Financial attackers go where the money is.

Something\nwe have not discussed as much is the fact that the\nvolume of email stolen through the years is likely\ngreater than all other forms of electronic data\ntheft combined.\n\nThe 2016 United States presidential election\nbrought email hacking and theft back to the\nforefront as a major cybersecurity issue. During\nthe past year, Mandiant conducted many\ninvestigations that highlighted how attackers\nobtained access to email while bypassing\nnetwork segmentation and multi-factor\nauthentication when necessary.\n\nOAuth Phishing and Delegation\nOAuth is an open standard used by applications\nto authorize the sharing of information without a\npassword. Since 2015, Mandiant has observed an\nincrease in phishing campaigns targeting OAuth\ntokens for cloud service providers, especially\nthose that provide email services. While these\n\n**Figure 9.**\n\n\nOAuth attacks are not new, we have observed an\nincrease in the use of these techniques to access\nthe email and documents of targeted users as\nmore businesses move to cloud-based providers.\n\nWith an OAuth token, an attacker has the\nability to bypass multi-factor authentication\nto access a target user’s cloud resources such\nas email, calendar and shared documents.\nMandiant discovered that attackers used the\nfollowing techniques to compromise users of an\norganization that used Google’s G Suite for email:\n\n1. The attacker registered and created a\nmalicious Google application.\n\n2. The attacker sent phishing emails\ncontaining a link to register the malicious\napplication to their Google account.\n\n3. Once the attacker’s malicious application\nhad permission, it could access the user’s\ndata, even after an account password reset.\n\nFigure 9 is an example of an APT28 phishing email\nthat Mandiant discovered during an investigation,\nwhich claimed to be from Google Support.\n\n\n-----\n\nATTACK TRENDS **17**\n\n\nATTACK TRENDS **17**\n\nThe “Permit Scanning” link\n**Figure 10.**\nin the email used a URL\nshortening service to hide the\nmore suspicious full URL and\nevade link content inspection.\nWhen clicked, it launched the\nlegitimate Google Accounts\nsite. In this case, the user sees\ndefault images, the name\nGoogle Scanner and the\nconfirmation that the site is\nsecure in the address bar.\n\nAssessing the legitimacy\n\n**Figure 11.**\n\nof the “Google Scanner”\nrequired the user to click the\ndown arrow next to “Google\nScanner” to reveal the\ndeveloper information and the\nmalicious redirection URL.\n\n\n-----\n\n**18** M-TRENDS 2017\n\nWhen the user clicked the “Allow” button, the malicious application was granted an OAuth token\nwith full access to read, write, and delete content from the user’s Gmail and Google Drive.\n\n**Figure 12.**\n\n\nMonitoring for this type of activity on a host\nlevel is nearly impossible and detecting it on\nthe network is also extremely difficult because\nmost authorizations occur over an encrypted\nconnection. In some cases, such as in the example\nabove, the authorization occurred over HTTPS.\n\nThe most effective way we have found to identify\nthese types of attacks is to use the service\nprovider’s administration panel to audit the\nauthorized applications connected to an account\nand the OAuth token authentications. In Google’s\nG Suite, this information exists in the OAuth token\naudit log. Once an investigator has identified\nthe compromised accounts, they can investigate\nfurther to determine how the attacker gained\naccess to the account.\n\n\nMicrosoft Exchange Web Services\nMicrosoft Exchange Web Services (EWS) provides\nthe ability to access data stored in Microsoft\nExchange programmatically over HTTPS. While\nOutlook Web Access (OWA) supports multifactor authentication and Microsoft Azurebased Office 365 implementations support\nmulti-factor authentication through the “Modern\nAuthentication” feature, internally hosted\nExchange instances do not have this option. This\nmeans that EWS and ActiveSync on internally\nhosted Exchange instance are single-factor only.\nSome organizations have not enabled the new\nauthentication mechanism in Office 365 because\nsome legacy clients on desktops and mobile\ndevices do not support it.\n\n\n-----\n\nATTACK TRENDS **19**\n\n\nPowerShell Mailbox Harvesting Using EWS\nMandiant has observed attackers abusing\nsingle-factor authentication in EWS to harvest\nemails from user mailboxes. For internally\nhosted instances, it is possible to do this from\nthe Internet. In cases where attackers cannot\ndirectly access an email server from the Internet,\nMandiant has observed attackers move laterally\nto Exchange servers to harvest emails. This\nlateral movement often occurs through a web\nshell backdoor that attackers place on the\nserver, such as malicious active service pages\n(ASP) content or Internet Server Application\nProgramming Interface (ISAPI) extensions for\nInternet Information Services (IIS). Mandiant has\nalso observed attackers install remote desktop\nprotocol (RDP) tunnelers to connect out from the\nExchange server, which allowed them to bypass\n\n\nthe perimeter security controls and establish an\nRDP connection to the server from the Internet.\n\nAPT29 used a custom PowerShell script to\nharvest the contents of Exchange mailboxes\nusing EWS. The attackers tunneled traffic through\nintermediary servers to the Exchange server\nand used EWS API methods that the attacker\nexposed to the Internet to dump the contents of\nuser mailboxes.\n\nFigure 13 shows the command line of this\nPowerShell script, which allowed the attackers to\ntarget specific users and specify the days of email\nto dump from the server.\n\n\n**Figure 13.**\nPowerShell command\nline of EWS mailbox\ndumping script.\n\n\n###### C:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\cmd.exe /c “powershell -ep bypass -f Dump.ps1 -Domain [DOMAIN] -User\n [USERNAME] -Password [PASSWORD] -Mailbox [EMAIL ADDRESS] -Days 1 -OutputFolder [OUTPUT FOLDER] -EWSUrl [EWS URL]”\n\n\nIn a default configuration, this technique leaves very little forensic evidence for investigators to\nfollow, especially if the attacker securely deletes the output of the command.\n\n\n-----\n\n**20** M-TRENDS 2017\n\nMailbox Delegation\nMandiant also discovered APT29 attackers using\nmailbox delegation to access to the mailboxes of\nother users. This allowed one account to harvest\nthe email for multiple accounts.\n\nInvestigators should review the MSExchange\nManagement application log for successful cmdlet\nexecutions of Add-MailboxPermission with\nEvent ID 1. This event identifies the permissions,\ntarget and recipient of the delegation. Typical\nindicators of malicious activity are a single\naccount that has delegated access to more than\none mailbox within a short timeframe or if an\naccount has been delegated Full Access.\n\nFigure 14 shows an example of a successful\ndelegation from the event log.\n\n**Figure 14.**\nExample event log\nentry for successful\nAdd-MailboxPermission\ncmdlet with Full Access.\n\n###### Cmdlet succeeded. Cmdlet Add-MailboxPermission-++-{AutoMapping=False, User=[Email Address], AccessRights={FullAccess}, InheritanceType=All, Identity=[AD Distinguished Name]}-++-\n\n\n-----\n\nATTACK TRENDS **21**\n\n\nTactical Recommendations\nTactical recommendations to detect these\nattacks include enhanced auditing of changes\nto email or multi-factor authentication\ninfrastructure.\n\n- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for\n\nEmail: Mandiant recommends using a timebased one-time password (TOTP) hardware\ntoken smartphone-based application as\na second factor of authentication. Avoid\ntechnologies that use SMS or device\ncertificate-based authentication, as these\nsolutions are easier to bypass.\n\nIf your organization uses Microsoft Office 365,\nensure that the “Modern Authentication” option\nis enabled and clients are using the Azure AD\nAuthentication Library (ADAL). Note that this\noption will prevent legacy desktop and mobile\nclients from authenticating to the service.\nAvoid exposing internally hosted Exchange\nservers directly to the Internet since EWS and\nActiveSync on these systems do not support\nMFA. Require users to VPN into the corporate\nnetwork using a VPN that requires MFA before\naccessing their email.\n\n- Conduct Dynamic Link Analysis: Conduct\n\ndynamic link analysis for email content\ninspection. Users are generally more likely to\nrecognize a malicious URL in its expanded form.\n\n- Educate users on the security risks of\n\nconnecting applications to their accounts:\nAdditional security awareness training should\nfocus on teaching users how to validate\nwhether an application is requesting excessive\npermissions to their account or if that\napplication might be malicious. Teach users\nhow to check the authorized applications and\n\n\ndevices that can access data in their accounts.\nSites such as Google and Facebook periodically\nremind users to check their security settings\nand connected applications and devices.\n\n- Audit Connected Applications: Periodically\n\naudit applications that use OAuth to access\nuser data. Ensure that the authorized\napplications are legitimate and have a\nbusiness need.\n\n- Enhance PowerShell Logging: PowerShell\n\nusage has very little logging in its default\nconfiguration, but there are options to increase\nthis logging. Mandiant has previously written\nabout PowerShell’s enhanced logging on\nthe FireEye Threat Research blog.² Module\nLogging and Script Block Logging can help\nforensic investigators determine the malicious\nPowerShell commands run by attackers.\n\n- Audit Multi-Factor Enrollment: Generate\n\nalerts when users enroll devices for multifactor authentication. Mandiant recommends\nmonitoring the following events:\n\n–– Token or device registrations. Determine if\n\nusers have multiple devices connected to\ntheir account(s).\n–– Users with emergency bypass codes or\n\nPIN-only mode.\n–– Location data of connections such as\n\ncountry and IP address. Determine if the\nsource of the authentication requests are\nanonymization services or VPN/hosting\nproviders.\n\n- Audit Exchange Mailbox Delegation:\n\nPeriodically audit and review the delegation\npermissions assigned to mailboxes within\nExchange.\n\n\n-----\n\n**22** M-TRENDS 2017\n\n###### Target: Banking Networks\n\n Banking network fraud incidents have spread around the world. Incidents have struck banks in Asia, Ukraine, Ecuador and India with losses totaling more than $100 million. These widespread events indicate that financial criminals see these networks as ripe for manipulation. \n\n\n-----\n\nATTACK TRENDS **23**\n\n\nCase Study - Banking Compromises in Asia\nIn early 2016, the staff at a bank in Asia was\nunable to access a domain controller – a server\nthat responds to security authentication requests\nwithin a Windows Server domain. An internal\ninvestigation discovered that a suspicious account\nhad been created with domain administrator\nprivileges, enabling unrestricted access to\nthousands of Windows systems – both servers\nand clients – across the enterprise. The bank\nquickly realized that many host systems had been\ncompromised using a malicious logon script that\ndistributed and executed the attacker’s malware.\n\nThe initial intrusion occurred two months prior to\ninitial detection, originating from a remote location\nwithin a wholly-owned subsidiary’s network.\nThe attackers found a system that had trusted\naccess to the bank’s enterprise infrastructure\nand leveraged this to access the bank network\nundetected. After establishing persistence\nin the Microsoft Windows environment,\nthey obtained Domain Admin access across\nmultiple hosts. The attackers leveraged Remote\nDesktop and Tivoli Remote Control along with\nbuilt-in Microsoft networking tools (all genuine\nenterprise management tools used by the bank’s\nIT staff) and were able to blend in to the bank’s\nenvironment, making it difficult to detect their\npresence or differentiate malicious behaviors from\nthe bank’s legitimate activities.\n\n\nWe uncovered evidence indicating that after\nplanting backdoors, the attackers utilized screen\ngrabbing and keylogging capabilities to capture\npasswords from authenticated users. There were\n30 hosts identified with screen grabber malware\nartifacts and more than 50 user profiles were\ncompromised by key logging software.\n\nThe attackers had access to credentials and\ninformation that included Enterprise Mail Systems,\nthe decoding of National Payment Message\nStandard (NPMS) format files, funds transfer/\nremittance systems and directory systems.\n\nAltogether, the presence of breach artifacts\nwas confirmed on 96 systems – 26 servers and\n70 workstations – and 30 systems were found\nto have active malware running at the time of\ninvestigation.\n\n\n**PRESENCE OF BREACH ARTIFACTS CONFIRMED ON** **ACTIVE MALWARE ON**\n\n#### 96 26 70\n###### SYSTEMS SERVERS WORKSTATIONS SYSTEMS\n\n#### [30]\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n**24** M-TRENDS 2017\n\n\nBanking Network Compromise in Europe\nDuring 2016, Europe and Middle East-based\nfinancial institutions were targeted by attackers. In\none investigation, the attackers used PowerShell\nand Metasploit to move laterally into the banking\nnetwork environment. Once in the banking\nnetwork environment, the attacker modified a\ncompromised banking network user account to no\nlonger require “four-eyes” approval on transfers.\nFour-eyes approval is the requirement that two\nsets of eyes are needed for every transaction –\none set of eyes to initiate the transaction and\nanother set of eyes to approve the transaction.\nThe attacker compromised both an account used\nto initiate transactions and an account used to\napprove transactions. Mandiant investigators\nsurmise that the attacker had significant\nknowledge of banking network transactions, in\npart evidenced by knowledge of the four-eyes\nprocess and how to circumvent that requirement\nby escalating the privileges of a targeted banking\nnetwork account. If the attacker had utilized both\naccounts, the “approver” would have likely been\nnotified of the transactions through the normal\nalerting processes and the transactions would\nlikely have been noticed sooner.\n\n\nOnce the attacker had control of the process,\nthey began to make a series of banking network\ntransfers worth millions of dollars. Banks typically\nhave a grace period on banking network\ntransactions and can recall transfers during that\ngrace period. To circumvent the grace period, the\nattacker wiped event logs and then reformatted\nsystem volumes on systems in and out of the\nbanking network environment. This caused\noutages that delayed the bank’s identification of\nthe fraudulent transactions, giving the attacker\nmore time to withdraw funds that had been\ntransferred.\n\nIn total, we confirmed 45 affected systems —\n29 servers and 16 workstations.\n\n\n-----\n\nATTACK TRENDS **25**\n\nComparing the Banking Breach Investigations\nAfter comparing the TTPs and decode scripts from the aforementioned\nbanking breach investigations, it was clear that we were dealing with the\nsame threat group. Several similarities emerged.\n\n\n**MALWARE NAMING**\n\n\nThe threat actors were good at blending into an environment and using\nnaming conventions to suit the environment. However, they seemed to favor\nthe use of tools named “hkcmd.exe”, “igfxpers.exe” and “msdtc.exe”. Just\nbecause a binary was named “hkcmd.exe” did not mean it was always the\nsame malware. They often used C:\\Windows for the malware and it was\nunsigned.\n\n\n**REGISTRY RESOURCES**\n\n\nWe observed the use of “MsOutData” (which stored an encrypted binary\nblob) in both environments as well as the “SOFTWARE\\Classes\\NR\\Content\nSetting” registry value, which stored the configuration data for their malware.\nThey used the identical 4-byte XOR key in all cases. We first observed this\n“Content Setting” in a 2014 banking breach investigation.\n\n\nATTACK TRENDS\n\n\n**ENCRYPTION**\n\n\n**TOTAL AFFECTED SYSTEMS**\n\n#### 45\n###### SYSTEMS\n\n#### 29\n###### SERVERS\n\n#### 16\n###### WORKSTATIONS\n\n\nWe observed consistent use of the same 4-byte XOR keys for the malware\nconfiguration. We identified some RC4 keys that were used consistently\nacross the engagements for the NESTEGG malware that was deployed. We\nalso observed that the attackers used the same command line passwords\nfor launching tools in all engagements. For example “[2016-02-24 14:25:04]\nAt3 | | | c:\\windows\\msdtc.exe | -x nf300karjfs9e8rhtQJ3u9gh -e Nla” at\nsome and “At1 | | | C:\\windows\\hkcmd.exe | -x nf300karjfs9e8rhtQJ3u9gh -e\nLogonHours” for others.\n\n\nIn all engagements, we observed that the attackers configured their malware\nto execute at SAFEBOOT (SAFEBOOT registry keys were updated). The\nattackers used “Windows Firewall Remote Management” or “Microsoft\nUpdate” as their firewall rulename for updating the firewall rules to allow\nnetwork access. The events followed a common timing pattern (no doubt\nbecause of they were using the same backdoor family). Attackers commonly\ndeployed screen grabber / keylogger malware. The output files used the same\nnaming conventions.\n\nWe also observed some changes over time. Initially, keylogs were in\n“.cache” files within the Internet Explorer directory. Later, they switched\nto using “.cer” files. Attackers made use of an “sdelete” type functionality\nwhere they renamed the file with a random name (same length, just\nrandom alpha chars) and also overwrote the file content. These artifacts\nwere seen in all engagements.\n\nThe capabilities exhibited by the threat actors — including the unique\nmalware customization, attack sophistication, and the CnC infrastructure\ninfiltration — indicated that they are a well-funded, highly organized group\n\n\n**OTHER TTPS**\n\n\n-----\n\n**26** M-TRENDS 2017\n\n###### FireEye as a Service –\n A View Into Emerging Threats\n\n FireEye as a Service (FaaS) provides managed detection, investigation and response capabilities to help organizations fully understand the threats with their environment, assess risk and take recommended action. Due to its ongoing monitoring of organizations around the globe in all industries, FaaS has a unique perspective into emerging threats and evolving attacker TTPs. \n\n\n-----\n\nFIREEYE AS A SERVICE – A VIEW INTO EMERGING THREATS **27**\n\n**FaaS: Providing Answers, Not Alerts**\nFaaS analysts look at compromises across all regions and\nindustries to ensure our customers are seeing the full threat\npicture behind each attack, thus helping deliver executive\nrisk awareness in addition to advanced threat protection\nand response capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n**28** M-TRENDS 2017\n\n###### OBSERVATION 1 New Campaigns, Old Techniques\n\nNot all new attacks utilize techniques analysts have never seen before.\nSome attackers still utilize old school tactics to gain access. Threat actors\nare increasingly targeting executives and other high-level employees,\ntricking them into activating malware that gives criminals access into their\ncompanies’ environments.\n\n\n###### EXAMPLE 1 New APT29\n Spear-Phishing Threat\n\nIn August 2016, the FaaS team\ndiscovered evidence of a new APT29\nspear-phishing event against one\nof our U.S.-based clients in the\ntechnology industry.\n\nAPT29 is a Russian group that\nengages in cyber operations where\nthe primary goal appears to be data\ntheft. APT29 targets include Western\ngovernments, foreign affairs and\npolicymaking bodies, government\ncontractors and universities.\n\nThe FaaS team initiated proactive\nnetwork hunting efforts for all FaaS\ncustomers and conducted forensic\nservices (sweeps) at clients that had\npreviously been targeted by APT29\nactors.\n\nAs a result, the FaaS team submitted\nmultiple malware samples to the\nFireEye Labs Advanced Reverse\nEngineering (FLARE) team.\n\nThis analysis led to the identification\nof three new APT29 malware families:\nthe malicious macro documents\n(VERNALDROP) that drop a stage one\ndownloader, which retrieves a second\nstage backdoor (TADPOLE); and the\nsecond stage backdoor (SPIKERUSH).\n\n\n###### EXAMPLE 2 Financial Cyber\n Threat Phishing\n\nIn March 2016, the FaaS team\nobserved attacks against FireEye and\nFaaS clients in the retail, hospitality\nand entertainment industries as part\nof a phishing campaign.\n\nFireEye was able to attribute these\nattacks to FIN8,³ a financially\nmotivated group that had previously\nconducted several tailored spearphishing campaigns. The group used\nemail attachments that were Microsoft\nWord documents containing an\nembedded macro which downloaded\na payload from a web-based cloud\nstorage service or actor controlled\nwebsite. The loader then installed\na PUNCHBUGGY variant providing\nthe actors with remote access to the\nvictim machine.\n\nIn the course of the investigation, the\nFaaS team also observed that the\nthreat group modified their phishing\ntechniques and started masquerading\nas a Mandiant consultant by modifying\nthe title and content of the phishing\nemail to indicate the actors knew they\nwere detected in client environments.\n\n\n-----\n\nFIREEYE AS A SERVICE – A VIEW INTO EMERGING THREATS **29**\n\n\n###### OBSERVATION 2 Common Techniques Found from Analysis of Industry Level Data\n\nConstantly analyzing network data\nenables the FaaS team to quickly\nidentify new threat and attack\ncampaigns.\n\n###### EXAMPLE New Threats\n in High Tech\n\nIn June 2016, FaaS performed in-depth\ncyber security event investigations\nat U.S.-based clients within the high\ntech industry which involved different\nactors and malware, but had similar\ncharacteristics in the way they used\nlegitimate services to gain access.\n\nOne technique common to both threat\ngroups was the use of legitimate web\nservices such as GitHub and Microsoft\nTechNet to communicate with\nbackdoors. These communications\nwere either complete command and\ncontrol instructions to their victims\nor were used to utilize the associated\nbackdoor to update CnC infrastructure.\n\nBased on our observation of separate\nthreat groups using legitimate services\nto infiltrate environments, the FaaS\nteam refined the NetFlow analytic and\nran it across all of our customers in the\ntechnology industry to identify any\nsuspicious connections to GitHub or\nTechNet indicative of these backdoors.\nFaaS has not identified any new\ncompromises for our customers to date.\n\n\n###### OBSERVATION 3 Existing Knowledge Aids in Finding New Evil\n\nStaying up to date on the latest\nactivities and trends in the threat\nlandscape will help you identify\nattacks before they happen.

The identified malware\nexhibits destructive behavior on\nWindows-based operating systems,\nuses a signed RawDisk driver from\nEldoS and renders a disk unbootable\nonce fully executed.\n\nWhile being a fully functional\nbackdoor, SHAMOON has primarily\nbeen used to destroy data on disk, and\nrender systems inoperable. Based on\nthe design of the SHAMOON malware\nfamily, it is believed that the implant\nis leveraged in later stage operations\nafter actors have gained and secured\naccess to a victim network and at\nleast possess network credentials.\nUpon execution, SHAMOON leverages\nnetwork credentials to propagate\na dropper to systems on the same\nnetwork that contains multiple\nsubcomponents. One of these\ncomponents, the wiper, will destroy\ndata on the target system. Destructive\nfeatures of the malware are supported\nby a secondary and legitimate driver\ncomponent used to access the hard\ndisk, which has become a trademark\ncharacteristic of the malware family.\n\nInitial forensic evidence exhibits\nseveral similarities to the SHAMOON\nmalware used against Saudi Aramco in\n2012 d th t t\n\n\nTactical Recommendations for\nStaying Protected Based on These\nThree FaaS Observations:\n\n- Ensure all of your certificates and\n\nsoftware are up to date.\n\n- Control software installation from\n\none central location to ensure only\nauthorized software gets installed.\n\n- Use application whitelisting to\n\nbetter control what programs can\nbe run on a host.\n\n- Configure web proxy in whitelist\n\nmode and block uncategorized\nsites.\n\n- Consider reviewing Office settings\n\nand disabling macros from running.\n\n- Educate employees of the risks\n\ninvolved with social engineering\nand phishing attacks.\n\n- Restrict administrative\n\npermissions associated with user\naccounts.\n\n- Enable host-based firewall.\n\n- Ensure backup of data is enabled\n\nfor high valued assets.\n\n- Ensure production systems are\n\ninstalled with latest updates.\n\n\n-----\n\n**30** M-TRENDS 2017\n\n###### Defensive and Emerging Trends\n\n\n-----\n\nDEFENSIVE AND EMERGING TRENDS **31**\n\n\n###### Adapting Foundational Defenses for the New Normal\n\nAs attackers innovate and threats evolve,\nsecurity organizations need to re-examine the\nfundamentals of their information security\nprograms to ensure they are adapting to the\nrealities of the evolving threat landscape and\nrelated risks. Based on our investigations and\nstrategic assessments, we have identified four\nkey fundamentals that should be re-evaluated\non a regular basis.\n\nMaintaining Visibility\n“Visibility” in the cyber security context refers to\nan organization’s ability to detect, alert on, and\ninvestigate attacks – as in,“seeing” the malicious\ncyber activity. It is a fundamental capability for\nany effective security team, and blind spots in\nthe infrastructure can lead to major problems. A\nrelatively common example of a visibility gap is\nthe lack of security data from an organization’s\nendpoints. As the cyber threat landscape evolves,\nvisibility gaps can emerge where once there\nwere none. The use of cyber threat intelligence\nis critical for organizations to identify potential\nblind spots as threat actor techniques change.\n\nWindows PowerShell is a good example of a\nrelatively new attack vector that many\norganizations are not monitoring and logging.\nAttackers are increasingly leveraging Windows\nPowerShell to conduct their operations when\nundertaking malicious activity within a victim’s\nenvironment. In many environments, PowerShell\ndoes not leave artifacts indicating its usage. In\nfact, most organizations do not even have\nvisibility of who is accessing it or when it is used.\nThis situation can be improved by upgrading\nolder versions of PowerShell (such as 2.0) to later,\nmore robust logging versions (5.0 offers a much\nbroader range of security information) and by\nimplementing additional logging features such as\nSysmon. The bottom line from an incident\nresponse perspective is that while PowerShell\nlogging was not a typically monitored event to\nmaintain effective cyber threat visibility five years\nago, it most definitely is now.[4]\n\nb l h h h ll\n\n\nCloud security monitoring is another area of\nenvironment monitoring that is required for\neffective cyber threat visibility, and one that\nmany organizations still struggle to undertake\nsuccessfully.\n\n\n###### Some questions to consider for cloud security:\n\n\nCan the organization see what files are\nbeing downloaded from a cloud based\nstorage site?\n\nAre administrator logins tracked and\nreviewed?\n\nCan you detect unauthorized\nprovisioning of cloud infrastructure?\n\nWhat security event information can\nthe cloud provider produce for your\norganization that will allow correlation\nor additional context during an\nincident?\n\nThere are numerous ways to improve visibility\nfor cloud transactions, but they require adjusting\nthe security team’s focus as the threats expand\nbeyond the perimeter. While visibility is not the\nsilver bullet of cyber security, it does increase\nthe capability of any organization to detect and\nrespond to those threats that substantially\nincrease risk.\n\nWith organizations supporting a more mobile\nworkforce, the notion of the network perimeter has\ndramatically shifted. Networks that traditionally had\nclean borders and limited demarcation points are\nexpanding. Visibility is required not only within\nthe network, but also in vendor connection points,\nmobile endpoints, subsidiary organizations and\nother interconnections. The capability for endpoints\nto be monitored, updated and forensically queried\nwhile off the network has grown in importance.\nThese issues have spurred a rising need for flexible\nsensor architectures that scale detection,\ninvestigation, data collection and processing in a\ncost-effective manner.\n\n\n-----\n\n**32** M-TRENDS 2017\n\nRethink What is Critical to the Business\n(Understanding the Infrastructure)\nHeadlines and regulations focus on sensitive\ndata (PII, PHI, PCI) and data breaches. However,\nevery organization should also consider\ntheir resilience to a cyber threat by asking,\n“What internal systems and data flows must\nbe protected for the business to continue to\nfunction?” Mandiant teams have seen a rise of\nbusiness disruption attacks where the attackers\nare not motivated to steal data, but rather\n\n\nto damage core business processes. Even\nwhen an attack such as ransomware is not\nnecessarily motivated by disruption, business\noperations can quickly suffer collateral damage.\nRansomware that locks a business-critical\nsystem can quickly and seriously damage\nbusiness operations and requires different\nmitigation approaches rather than preventing\nthe exfiltration of sensitive data. Organizations\nneed to examine every possible scenario\nand have playbooks ready to implement.\n\n\n-----\n\nDEFENSIVE AND EMERGING TRENDS **33**\n\n\nNetwork Segmentation and Data Segregation\nIn incident response and security program\nassessments, Mandiant still finds that the\nfamiliar concept of network segmentation and\ndata segregation has been overlooked. When\ncustomers overlook these fundamentals, detection\nand remediation are much more difficult and the\nresulting impact of the breach is significantly higher.\nLack of segmentation (both data and network)\nleads to easy lateral movement as illustrated in\nthe APAC and EMEA financial sector breaches.\n\nSegmentation can be effective in restricting threat\nactor movement within the victim environment\nand can help limit access to sensitive data.\nTypically, firewalls and VLANs are used to\nseparate the network into trust zones. One\ntrust zone may contain PII, another may contain\nproprietary data and the next zone may hold\npoint of sale terminals. Network segmentation\nhelps reduce the ability of a threat actor to\nmove within the environment once they gain a\nfoothold by limiting their access to a single trust\nzone and limiting the amount of data that can\nbe accessed. Segmentation increases the level of\nexpertise a threat actor needs to acquire access\nand requires additional time and movement,\nproviding organizations additional opportunities\nto detect threat activity. Authentication\nand authorization controls provide further\nsegregation at the system or data level, ensuring\nthat there is separation of duties and applying\n“least privilege” to individual user credentials.\nData segregation helps reduce the ability of\na threat actor to access the organization’s\ndata with a single compromised credential.\n\nMonitoring the network traffic across segmented\ntrust zone boundaries gives organizations the\nability to detect anomalous traffic patterns that\ncould indicate a compromise. Applying user\nbehavioral analytics across individual trust zones\ncan give organizations more granular visibility\ninto logon patterns, potentially making it easier\nto identify malicious credential use and allowing\norganizations to focus advanced monitoring\ntools on their most critical data assets.\n\n\nCompromises are inevitable, but segmenting\nnetworks, segregating data and ensuring\nthere is visibility to detect anomalous patterns\nbetween trust zones can help an organization\ndetect threat actors and reduces the impact\nand risk resulting from compromises.\n\nElevating Risk Awareness\nIn the past, boards of directors may have\nreceived an annual or biannual report on the\nstate of security in their organization. As the\nnumber of breaches escalated among all\nindustry sectors, cyber security became an\nimportant business risk that demanded to be\nincorporated into business strategies and new\nchannel offerings.\n\nWe are observing increased risk awareness\nbased on threat intelligence, as well as the\nmedia coverage of cyber breaches, ransomware\nattacks and other destructive attacks. All\norganizations are at risk and recognition of\nthis by business leaders, senior executives and\nboards is usually critical for the implementation\nand maintenance of effective mitigation\nstrategies to reduce the impact of attacks. New\nregulations being introduced are requiring board\nmembers to monitor and acknowledge in writing\nthat they accept the security risks in their\norganizations and accept the cyber programs in\nplace. As cyber attacks become more frequent\nand sophisticated, organizations of all sizes\nacross every industry must make cyber risk\nmanagement a priority, going beyond the IT\ndepartment. C-level executives, business line\nleaders and boards of directors need to take an\nactive role in cyber risk management and data\nbreach preparedness.\n\nBoards, senior executives and business line\nleaders should develop a cyber risk playbook.⁵\nOrganizations need to develop a postassessment action plan to help prepare for\nfuture risks and attacks\n\n\n-----\n\n**34** M-TRENDS 2017\n\n###### A Look Forward - An Intelligence- Led Approach to Security\n\nThreat Intelligence Taking the Driver’s Seat\nWe have seen that the incorporation of threat\nintelligence contributes to the success of an\ninformation security team. Previously, most\norganizations considered threat intelligence a\n“nice to have” rather than a “must have.” This\nresulted in organizations not truly understanding\nthe benefits that intelligence provides for risk\nreduction, prevention, detection and response.\nIncreased complexities in business delivery\nchannels, market strategies and attacker\nmethodologies have significantly increased the\nneed for effective threat intelligence, even in\norganizations that historically may not have felt\nthe need.\n\nMoving from Reactive to Proactive Defense\nwith Threat Intel\nOperationalizing cyber threat intelligence (CTI)\nis a trend we are starting to see take a prominent\nplace within enterprise security operations. This\nis ultimately a good thing; however, there are a\nlot of misperceptions within the marketplace. It is\nimportant to reinforce that:\n\n\nWe are seeing CTI play a significant role within\nmany of the defensive trends outlined in this\nsection, including automation and hunting.\nOrganizations are increasingly using threat\nintelligence to build and update their own\norganization’s baseline threat profile. Whether\nthrough analysis of malicious trends within their\nnetwork, analysis of threats affecting their sector,\nbusinesses carrying similar assets, or doing\nbusiness in similar regions, or a hybrid of all of\nthese, CTI is being leveraged to characterize\nand contextualize threat activity specifically\nrelevant to their business concerns. Executives\nand senior management are using this knowledge\nto better understand and plan for the risks\nfacing the business. In turn, this enables more\nefficient tactical operations in terms of hunting,\nidentification, prioritization and response. The\nfollowing graphic outlines how the flow of\nintelligence can inform these operations.\n\n\nCTI is not an appliance,\na data feed, or raw\ninformation, without\nsupporting analysis\nand judgement.\n\n\nCTI is accurate, timely,\nand relevant knowledge\nabout an event or series\nof events decisionmaking.\n\n\nCTI should be based\non some type\nof attributional\nunderstanding of the\nevent(s). Attribution\nshould include an\nunderstanding of the\nmotives, intentions,\nand capabilities\nunder which the\nindividual(s) operate.\n\n\nCTI should ultimately\nbe derived from sound\nhuman analysis of\nobservables gathered\nacross a diverse set\nof sources.\n\n\n-----\n\nDEFENSIVE AND EMERGING TRENDS **35**\n\n**DEFENSIVE**\n\n**THREAT**\n\n**PLANNING**\n\n**MODELING**\n\n**AUTOMATED**\n**WORKFLOWS**\n\n**TACTICAL**\n**PRIORITIZATION** **RESPONSIVE**\n\n**SCHEMES** **EFFICIENCY**\n\n**HUNT PLANNING**\n\n**THREAT MODELING** **TACTICAL PRIORITIZATION**\n**SCHEMES**\n\nInformed by knowledge gained from The threat profile should also make it\nthe threat profile regarding assets clear which threats present the highest\ntargeted and attacker motivation, impact to the organization and how\nthreat modeling exercises provide they should be prioritized.\nclear insight into what is occurring\nwithin threat landscape and what\n\n                                          - **Automated Workflows:** Automation\n\nspecific portions of that landscape\n\nof event handling.

The\ndata from those systems has typically been tied\nto some type of security incident and event\nmanagement (SIEM) system where security\noperations center (SOC) analysts review alerts\nseeking to correlate logs from those disparate\nsources across the enterprise. This has led to a\nhuge uptick in what security professionals refer\nto as “alert fatigue”. Critical alerts are hidden in\na deluge of false positives and non-useful data.\nFinding the important signal of a compromise in\nthe noise of alerts has become an increasingly\nsignificant challenge in 2016.\n\nTo counter this data and alert overload,\norganizations are relying more on tools and\nprocesses to filter data and automate analysis\nto redirect valuable security resources to more\ncomplex incident investigations and response.\nThis is especially true in smaller organizations\nthat may only have one or two security resources.\nAutomation can eliminate time spent on smaller\nand repeatable events, allowing redirection of\nresources for hunting, proactive defense and other\ntasks. Creating playbooks for repeatable events\ncan enable automation of disposition of false\npositives, minor alerts, and informational alerts\nallowing time to focus on the critical alerts in the\nenvironment and decreasing response time.\n\n\n###### Threat Hunting\n\nActive threat hunting is a human-centric process\nby which security practitioners search through\ndata to find evidence of intrusion using a\nvariety of techniques. While the investigation\nprocess remains the same after evil has been\nfound, hunting differs from typical alert-driven\ninvestigations in that a human is responsible for\ngenerating their own investigative leads to pursue.\n\nIn the not too distant past, actively hunting\nfor intruders on your network was something\nreserved for the most experienced practitioners\nin the most well resourced security operation\ncenters. More recently, we’ve seen smaller\norganizations and less experienced analysts\nelecting to participate in hunting activities and\nactively seeking tools, technology and staff to\nsupport this function.\n\nIt is common for relatively scarce and innovative\ntechniques to flow down into more common\npractice over time as techniques become better\ncodified and automation tooling becomes\navailable. It is not surprising that hunting\nfollowed suit as well. We attribute the rise of\nhunting operations to three things: the evolution\nof opportunistic attacks, enhanced security\noperation center visibility and a collective\nexperience increase amongst practitioners.\n\nThreat hunting is to incident response as event\ncorrelation is to incident detection. Threat actors\nare humans, and as such, exhibit behavioral\npatterns in their methods that can be used to\nidentify origin of attack, identity of attacker,\nmotivations, methods or toolset. By uncovering\nsimilarities and patterns in attack instances by\ncombining these TTPs, IOCs and similar trends,\nthese correlations solidify into actionable data\nthat can be used to identify, respond to and\nthwart future attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nDEFENSIVE AND EMERGING TRENDS **37**\n\n\nOpportunistic Attacker Evolution\nSeveral attacker techniques are inherently hard to\ndetect because of their reliance on compromising\nlegitimate user accounts. Additionally, many of\nthese techniques are focused on latter parts\nof the attack lifecycle — after gaining an initial\nfoothold and often avoiding the use of malware,\ninstead relying on built-in operating system\ntools such as PowerShell. Traditional detection\nmechanisms generally fail at detecting these\ntechniques without a plethora of false positive\nalerts, requiring a more human-centric approach.\n\nThreat hunting provides an opportunity to detect\nsuch scenarios, as it affords analysts the ability\nto perform manual searches and aggregations\nagainst known normal activity to find outliers\nbased on attributes such as the time the activity\noccurred or the expected behavior of the user\nwho conducted it. For example, if a user in the\nfinance department uses PowerShell, that might\nbe unexpected. Furthermore, if that user logs\ninto multiple machines at an odd hour, that too\nmight be worth an investigation. Mature security\norganizations invest in threat hunting, because\ntraditional machine-centric detection tools don’t\neffectively help in many of these scenarios.\n\nIncreased SOC Visibility\nMany organizations have spent time thinking\nabout visibility and have invested in it\naccordingly. This includes deploying more\nnetwork sensors, switching to distributed\nsensor models to encompass branch offices and\ndeploying endpoint agents for host-level visibility.\n\nAs the amount of data SOCs can interact with\nincreases, more use cases are enabled that can\nbe used to uncover malicious activity. Simple\naggregations such as selecting HTTP user agents\nobserved in network traffic and sorting that list\nby least frequently seen occurrences can yield a\nnumber of interesting data points. However, such\nanalysis is often better suited to manual analysis\nthan automated detection.\n\n\nAdditionally, use cases where network and host\ndata can be correlated to provide a clearer picture\nof compromise are becoming better enabled\nas endpoint detection and response tools gain\nfavor. By correlating the execution time and hash\nvalue associated with the file to network logs, a\nSOC analyst could determine where the file was\nobtained and how it came to exist on the system.\nAnalysis of the source will yield additional data\npoints that could lead to discovery of further\ninfection. This is an ideal hunting scenario made\npossible by increased visibility.\n\nIncreasing Skills\nWhile threat hunting used to be a niche skill, it\nhas become better codified and accessible to less\nexperienced analysts as more training and tooling\nto support the skill has become available. We\nhave observed an increase in the number of talent\nacquisition requests for threat hunting expertise\nfrom security mature organizations. We’ve also\nseen far more resumes coming into organizations\nfrom individuals who claim to have threat hunting\nexperience. Threat hunting is now among the most\ncommonly sought skills in defensive security and\nthe associated training and education markets are\nshifting to meet this demand.\n\nWe anticipate these trends will continue. The\nsophistication of opportunistic attackers will\ngrow and security conscious organizations\nwill attempt to defend themselves with more\nvisibility, which will breed threat hunting skills\nin analysts with a willingness and curiosity to\nexplore data to find evidence of compromise.\n\n\n-----\n\n**38** M-TRENDS 2017\n\n\nFireEye observed a continued focus\non financial services organizations in\nAPAC. Headline breaches dominated\nthe financial services industry for 2016,\nand Mandiant continues to respond to\nsignificant sophisticated compromises\nin these industries as well as many\nothers driven by financial motivation.\n\n\n-----\n\nSPOTLIGHT ON APAC REGIONAL TRENDS **39**\n\n\n2016 brought a notable increase\nin attacks against ATMs and ATM\nnetworks using various types of\nmalware. Similarities between ATM\ncompromises with significant financial\nlosses in Thailand and Taiwan strongly\nsuggest these were linked to actors\nand activity in Eastern Europe.\n\n\nVarious regional nation-state-sponsored\nAPTs continued to harvest vulnerable\ncommercial and government systems\nfor PII for influence, intelligence and\npolitical gain.\n\n\nGeopolitical events within APAC\nseemingly continued to drive nationstate-sponsored espionage across the\nregion with some telecommunication\ncompanies continually targeted.\n\n\n-----\n\n**40** M-TRENDS 2017\n\n**Early 2016**\n\nThreat actors targeted\nthe banking networks of\nseveral financial institutions\nin South and Southeast\nAsia, including Bangladesh\nand Vietnam.\n\nThe website of Taiwan’s\nDemocratic Progressive\nParty (DPP) was\ncompromised. The threat\n\n**April 2016**\n\ngroup was able to profile\nthe systems used by visitors\nto the website. FireEye\npreviously observed\nmultiple China-based\ncyber espionage groups\nusing the same tool. Its use\nagainst Taiwanese political\ntargets suggests that the\nactors behind the identified\ncampaign are supported by\nmainland Chinese sponsors.\n\n\n###### APAC Notable Breaches\n\n\n## $2\nBILLION USD\n\n\nThe South Korean government accused\ncyber threat actors based in North\nKorea of releasing PII of customers\nof a large online shopping site. The\norganization only learned of the breach\nwhen they received a ransom demand\nof more than $2 billion USD.\n\n\n**July 2016**\n\n\nThe Commission on\nElections in the Philippines\nsuffered a breach involving\nthe personal information\nof 70 million people. The\n\n**March 2016** breach included fingerprint\n\ndata and passport\ninformation and occurred\njust weeks before a national\nelection.\n\n**June 2016**\n\nA large Australian construction\nfirm suffered a significant breach\nfrom financially motivated cyber\nthreat actors. These actors used\na spear-phishing email to target\nemployees with access to financial\nsystems. The attacker was able to\nsteal $1.2 million AUD, but the total potential exposure was\nmore than $2 million AUD. During the investigation, Mandiant\nuncovered a second attack group within the network. The\nsecond threat actor had been active since late 2015 and was\nfocusing heavily on internal reconnaissance and ensuring\npersistent access. This second actor was utilizing malware\nwith debug code written in the Russian language, but no\nattribution has been confirmed at this stage.\n\n\n**August 2016**\n\n\nA large hospital was compromised using\nAndromeda malware and the Dark Comet\nremote administration tool. This compromise\nhad been undetected for more than two\nyears. The communication between the\nhospital environment and the cyber threat\nactors had been consistent via an internet\nfacing server from within the hospital environment. While we\nhave no attribution for this threat actor group, the use of this\nhospital by many tourists for medical procedures highlights the\nrisk of cyber threat activity against health systems that hold\npersonal health information across the globe.\n\n\nMandiant investigated a\nbreach of a large subsidiary\ncompany that spread to\nthe conglomerate parent\ncompany through lateral\nnetwork accesses, and\ncontinued to compromise the parent company systems\nacross several APAC countries. An interesting aspect\nof this case is that company turnover of approximately\n90 percent was directly attributed to this compromise.\nAfter the Mandiant investigation, there were strong leads\nindicating involvement of a disgruntled former employee.\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTIONSPOTLIGHT ON APAC REGIONAL TRENDS **41**\n\n###### Major Industries in the APAC Region Susceptible to Cyber Threats\n\n**INDUSTRY** **MOTIVATION** **TARGET**\n\n|Construction and Engineering|With engineering powerhouses such as Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, the region is home to innovations that are highly coveted by nations with less advanced engineering capabilities.

Fully effective\nin May 2018, the GDPR brings major reform to\nEuropean data protection laws, creating a new\ncompliance regime for the handling of personal\ndata relating to EU based citizens.\n\nAt the heart of the GDPR is an expectation\nthat organizations adopt a proactive approach\nto information security governance. Measures\nshould be implemented to effectively control\nthe processing of EU citizens’ personal data\nwithin their business in a manner that is fair\nand transparent to the individual, consistent\nwith security best practices, and aligned to the\nstatutory requirements of the legislation. Failure\nto comply with these rules creates a potentially\nsignificant exposure - fines for non-compliance\nmay be levied at up to 4% of annual global\ngroup turnover.\n\n\nIn addition to the discussion of what constitutes\nawareness, there is a further need for more\nclarity around the exclusion of breaches which\nare “unlikely to result in a risk” to the individual.\nBoth points are open to interpretation and it is\nexpected that the precise scope and process for\nhandling breach notifications will come in over\nthe next 18 months as member state regulators\nexpand on the GDPR with more detailed local\nguidance. The intent of the new regime is clear:\nthe EU is moving towards, and will soon have,\nmandatory breach notification regulation with a\nstrict requirement to notify regulators of personal\ndata breaches.\n\nOrganizations should be preparing now, ensuring\nnot only that they have an effective incident\nresponse plan in place to escalate, manage and\nreport potential data breaches, but that this\nsits within a coherent governance framework\nthat supports compliance with all other aspects\nof the GDPR. If a breach occurs, expect the\nregulator to look at the adequacy of the wider\nsecurity measures adopted by the business, and\nthe overall approach to information management\nand privacy compliance. Organizations that have\na clear story to tell will be best placed to mitigate\nthe risks of major fines. Those operating without\na set of clearly defined incident response\ngovernance processes and accompanying\nappropriate security controls will come under\ndirect scrutiny and could be subject to material\nexposure risk.\n\nGiven the magnitude of the potential fines it\nis advised that organizations take the time to\nnot only assess how they monitor and protect\nEU citizens’ personal data, but also undertake\ntabletop exercises to stress test their ability to\neffectively comply and respond to GDPR breach\nnotification regulation requirements.\n\n\nLegal considerations\nprovided by DLA\nPiper UK\n\n\nThe rigor with which the new regulation has been\ndesigned is intended to provide EU consumers\nwith enhanced confidence that they can safely\nshare information and interact within the global\ndigital marketplace. Mandiant partnered with law\nfirm DLA Piper UK for an assessment of the legal\nconsiderations of GDPR.\n\nA key requirement of the new regulation is that\norganizations must notify local privacy regulators\n— and in some cases individuals — of cyber\nincidents involving the loss of personal data\nwithin 72 hours of having become aware of it. Of\ncourse awareness is subjective, it is a function\nof the complex interactions of an organization’s\nincident response capabilities. Subsequently,\nthe GDPR regulation goes as far as defining\nthe window of notification, but not the trigger\nthat starts the clock ticking. The onus for this\nfalls to the respective processing organization,\nand thus it is prudent for affected organizations\nto incorporate an appropriate GDPR breach\nnotification provision into their existing incident\nresponse plans.\n\n\n-----\n\nCONCLUSION **47**\n\nWe frequently say that organizations must\nalways be adapting to an ever-changing and\nevolving threat landscape, and that continues\nto be true as we move deeper into 2017. Last\nyear saw attackers greatly improve their level\nof sophistication, with some financial threat\ngroups leaving very little evidence behind and\nmaking it extra challenging for analysts to\ninvestigate and remediate. Additionally, tactics\nsuch as calling targets directly show that threat\nactors are thinking outside the box and have\nbecome more brazen.\n\nSecurity operations teams can now better\nidentify, prioritize and address some of these\nthreats with intelligence-led automation and\nthreat hunting, but they cannot overlook the\ncore fundamentals and best practices such as\nnetwork segmentation and data segregation.\nNowadays simply protecting critical business\nassets isn’t good enough – some attackers are\nlooking to disrupt business until a ransom is paid,\nso organizations must focus on securing what is\nneeded for regular operations to continue.\n\nFortunately, we’re seeing that organizations\nare becoming better at identifying breaches.\nThe global median time from compromise to\n\n###### Conclusion\n\ndiscovery has dropped significantly from 146\ndays in 2015 to 99 days 2016, but it is still not\ngood enough. As we noted in M-Trends 2016, a\nMandiant Red Team can obtain access\nto domain administrator credentials within\nroughly three days of gaining initial access to\nan environment, so 99 days is still 96 days\ntoo long.\n\nWith media coverage of cyber attacks and\ncompromised data at an all-time high, even\npeople who don’t work in the security industry\nknow that breaches are inevitable. It is just as\nimportant to be ready and able to respond to\nan incident as it is to protect against threats.\nOrganizations should consider partnering with\norganizations that specialize in defending against\nthreats specific to the business.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### For more information on FireEye, visit: www.FireEye.com\n\n**FireEye, Inc.**\n1440 McCarthy Blvd. Milpitas, CA 95035\n[408.321.6300 / 877.FIREEYE (347.3393) / info@FireEye.com](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/05/windows-zero-day-payment-cards.html.)\n\n**www.FireEye.com**\n\nFireEye is the intelligence-led security company.
