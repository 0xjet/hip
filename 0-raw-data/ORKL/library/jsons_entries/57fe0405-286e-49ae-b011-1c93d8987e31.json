Soon after, the\nserver was isolated, logs were collected for forensic analysis, and the software patch was\napplied,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Autodesk’s Security team has concluded their investigation and observed no malicious\nactivity beyond the initial software installation.\"\n\n## One of many tech companies breached in a large-scale hacking spree\n\nThe [supply-chain attack that led to SolarWinds's infrastructure getting breached](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-fireeye-breached-after-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack/)\nwas [coordinated by the hacking division of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (aka](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-government-confirms-russian-svr-behind-the-solarwinds-hack/)\nAPT29, The Dukes, or Cozy Bear).\n\nAfter gaining access to the company's internal systems, the attackers trojanized the Orion\nSoftware Platform source code and builds released between March 2020 and June 2020.\n\nThese malicious builds were later used to deliver a backdoor tracked as Sunburst to \"fewer\nthan 18,000,\" but, luckily, the threat actors only picked a substantially lower number of\ntargets for second-stage exploitation.\n\nAs a direct result of this supply-chain attack, the Russian state hackers gained access\nto the networks of multiple US federal agencies and private tech sector firms.\n\nBefore the attack was disclosed, SolarWinds said it had 300,000 customers worldwide\n\n[[1,](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.solarwinds.com/company/customers) [2], including over 425 US Fortune 500 companies, all top ten US telecom companies.](http://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.solarwinds.com/company/customers)\n\nThe company's customer list also included a long list of govt agencies (the US Military, the\nUS Pentagon, the State Department, NASA, NSA, Postal Service, NOAA, the US\nDepartment of Justice, and the Office of the President of the United States).\n\nAt the end of July, the US Department of Justice was the latest US government entity to\ndisclose that 27 US Attorneys' offices were breached during last year's SolarWinds global\nhacking spree.\n\n[SolarWinds has reported expenses of $3.5 million from dealing with last year's supply-chain](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/solarwinds-reports-35-million-in-expenses-from-supply-chain-attack/)\nattack in March 2021, including remediation and incident investigation costs.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[GitHub: Attackers stole login details of 100K npm user accounts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-attackers-stole-login-details-of-100k-npm-user-accounts/)\n\n[Google shut down caching servers at two Russian ISPs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/google-shut-down-caching-servers-at-two-russian-isps/)\n\n[Hacker says hijacking libraries, stealing AWS keys was ethical research](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-says-hijacking-libraries-stealing-aws-keys-was-ethical-research/)\n\n[Popular Python and PHP libraries hijacked to steal AWS keys](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/popular-python-and-php-libraries-hijacked-to-steal-aws-keys/)\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[APT29](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/apt29/)\n[Autodesk](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/autodesk/)\n[Russia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/russia/)\n[Russian SVR](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/russian-svr/)\n[Security Breach](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/security-breach/)\n[SolarWinds](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/solarwinds/)\n[Supply-Chain Attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/supply-chain-attack/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
