(Flickr/Paul Kellar,\nhttps://flic.kr/p/49cnTB; CC BY 2.0, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/)\n\nOn Oct. 20 and 21, 2020, just two weeks before Election Day, Iranian actors sent out\n[spoofed emails to thousands of American voters in Florida, Alaska and Arizona. The emails](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/20/proud-boys-emails-florida/)\nwere designed to appear as though they were sent by the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist\ngroup, and threatened “we will come after you” if recipients did not vote for Donald Trump.\n[Some of the emails were also accompanied by a link to a video depicting Trump calling vote-](https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-blames-iran-for-spoofed-proud-boys-emails-threatening-democrat-voters/)\nby-mail “a terrible thing” and followed by what was made to look like a demonstration of how\nto fraudulently produce a mail-in ballot. Government officials and cybersecurity experts\n[debunked the video’s demonstration, but the video continued to circulate on social media.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/20/proud-boys-emails-florida/)\nWithin 48 hours, then-Director of National Intelligence (DNI) John Ratcliffe attributed this\ndisinformation campaign to Iran, alleging that Iran’s purpose was to undermine Trump’s\npresidential campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the past few years, Iran has become [increasingly sophisticated and](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-FireEye-Iranian-IO.pdf) [active in online](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/02/information-operations-fabricated-personas-to-promote-iranian-interests.html)\ncommunities targeting the American public. And its brazen tactics leading up to the election\ncould mark a shift in the country’s influence strategy toward the United States. According to\nthe public record, this is the first time that Iranian actors have engaged in an election\ninterference campaign targeting the United States utilizing stolen voter information in\ninfluence operations.\n\nBut to the extent that Iran targets U.S. audiences in sustained disinformation campaigns, it\n[still typically aims to broadly promote Iranian interests—such as denigrating sanctions](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA704-1.html)\nagainst the country and bolstering their moral standing compared to the U.S.—rather than\nattempting to induce a specific result in American domestic affairs. More importantly, Iran is\n[almost certainly expending far more of its resources on its geopolitical sphere of influence in](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/iranian-digital-influence-efforts-guerrilla-broadcasting-for-the-twenty-first-century/)\nthe Middle East and North Africa.\n\n[As the Atlantic Council’s Thomas Warrick notes, Iran’s influence activities may not be as](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/how-to-defeat-iranian-and-russian-cyber-operations-against-the-us-election/)\nmuch of a shift in strategy as a shift toward using disinformation as a retaliation tactic. Iran\nhas often engaged in symmetric cyber retaliation, responding to both kinetic and\ncyberattacks with cyberattacks on private and public industry. With this strategy, Iran is able\nto [assert its national power without directly escalating and provoking a military confrontation.](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/how-to-defeat-iranian-and-russian-cyber-operations-against-the-us-election/)\n\nNotably, about a week before the first Proud Boys emails hit Americans’ inboxes, Iranian\n[infrastructure suffered two major cyberattacks—one on the electronic infrastructure of its](https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-cyber-attacks-int/iran-says-one-of-two-cyber-attack-targets-was-countrys-ports-news-agency-idUSKBN271135)\nports and one against an undisclosed target. Regardless of whether the U.S. was behind the\nattacks, Iran tends to assume some level of U.S. involvement in cyberattacks on its\ninfrastructure. So the spoofed emails that Iranian actors sent a week later may well have\nbeen a familiar reflexive response—albeit using cyber-enabled disinformation rather than a\nmore traditional cyberattack.\n\nAlternatively, Iran’s brash foray into U.S election interference may have been a sign of Iran’s\nincreasing desperation to escape the maximum pressure campaign mounted by the Trump\nadministration by supporting an opposing candidate it believed would be a less aggressive\nand more predictable adversary. Just days prior to the email scam, the Trump administration\n[reimposed severe sanctions on Iran, including on its financial sector. Cybersecurity experts](https://apnews.com/article/europe-iran-archive-509205fc4f0d93a5a72bc6e812cfde51)\nand Trump administration officials disagreed over the ultimate goal of the Proud Boys email\nand video, but one aim may have been to target potential voters with a message\nemphasizing the connection between Trump and right-wing extremism, a narrative Trump\n[himself promulgated when he told the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by” during one of](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-donald-trump-chris-wallace-0b32339da25fbc9e8b7c7c7066a1db0f)\nthe presidential debates.\n\nAhead of the 2020 presidential elections, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence\n(ODNI) highlighted the threat of election interference by Iran. During and shortly after the\n2016 presidential campaign, the ODNI—and a consensus of cybersecurity experts—were\n\n\n-----\n\n[concerned primarily with disinformation by Russian actors. But under the Trump](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2020_10_06_homeland-threat-assessment.pdf)\n[administration, the ODNI shifted its public focus toward election interference operations by](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/item/2139-statement-by-ncsc-director-william-evanina-election-threat-update-for-the-american-public)\nIran—and, to a lesser extent, China.\n\nUnder Trump, the ODNI’s analysis tended to attribute to Iran long-term objectives that most\nexperts [see as closer to Russia’s. For instance, in a](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA704-2.html) widely covered August 2020 press\nrelease, the ODNI announced that China, Russia and Iran were all engaged in influence\n[efforts related to the 2020 election. According to the report, Iran was seeking to “undermine](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/item/2139-statement-by-ncsc-director-william-evanina-election-threat-update-for-the-american-public)\nU.S. democratic institutions … and divide the country” whereas Russia was reportedly “using\na range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden.” However, the\ncumulative evidence of Iran’s influence operations indicates that Iran’s aim is [persuasion in](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/iranian-digital-influence-efforts-guerrilla-broadcasting-for-the-twenty-first-century/)\nthe hopes of achieving a friendlier foreign policy posture from the U.S. and the rest of the\nworld—while Russia’s [disinformation campaigns are directed more broadly at weakening](https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/lessons-from-the-mueller-report-on-russian-political-warfare/)\ndemocratic institutions and dividing the American public.\n\nIndeed, just this past October in its Homeland Threat Assessment, the Department of\n[Homeland Security named Russia the greatest “purveyor of disinformation and](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2020_10_06_homeland-threat-assessment.pdf)\nmisinformation” within the U.S., assessing that Russia’s primary objective is to weaken the\nU.S. by “sow[ing] discord” and “undermin[ing] trust in Western democratic institutions and\nprocesses.” Some former high-ranking intelligence officials have also indicated that the focus\non Iran as opposed to Russia is misplaced. Former DNI Dan Coats’s warnings about the\n[threat Russia posed were reportedly watered down by the White House multiple times. And](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/28/us/politics/dan-coats-intelligence-chief-out.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)\nin an interview with NPR this past September, Sue Gordon, the former principal deputy\n[director of national intelligence—the second highest ranking official at the ODNI—remarked](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/13/902345240/exclusive-after-quitting-last-year-senior-u-s-intelligence-official-now-talks)\nthat she would have put Russia “first on the list” of election interference threats because of\nthe country’s demonstrated interest and capability.\n\nParticularly illuminating about Iran’s true influence priorities are a series of investigative\nreports from [Reuters,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-iran-specialreport-idUSKCN1NZ1FT) [FireEye and](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-FireEye-Iranian-IO.pdf) [ClearSky Cybersecurity, which uncovered a vast network](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Global-Iranian-Disinformation-Operation-Clearsky-Cyber-Security.pdf)\nof inauthentic news outlets and associated social media accounts pushing out Iranian\n[propaganda around the globe. Most of the sites in this particular network were taken offline](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-seizes-domain-names-used-iran-s-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps)\nin October 2020 when the FBI seized 92 domains, which had relied on U.S.-based web\nhosting services. However, many of the sites operated for several years before then, and\ntheir structure and operation still reveal clues about Iran’s strategy in the information space\nand its tactics for promulgating influence worldwide.\n\n[All but a few of the inauthentic news outlets concealed their ties to Iran and portrayed their](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-iran-specialreport-idUSKCN1NZ1FT)\noperations as originating in other countries. To help create an appearance of authenticity,\nfake social media accounts posing as journalists or political figures from a targeted country\n[pushed out content from a news website to audiences in that country. However, all of the](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/05/social-media-network-impersonates-us-political-candidates-supports-iranian-interests.html)\nsites published stories generated by the International Union of Virtual Media (IUVM) and the\nIslamic Radios and Televisions Union (IRTVU)—two media operations sanctioned by the\n\n\n-----\n\n[Treasury Department in October for being controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-security-sanctions-int/u-s-sanctions-three-new-iranian-organizations-for-alleged-election-disinformation-idUSKBN277346)\nCorps—which was itself controversially designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the\nState Department in April 2019.\n\n[Many of the sites also stole articles from legitimate news outlets, including Reuters and the](http://proactively/)\nAssociated Press, as filler to make the news sites appear genuine. Some of these stolen\narticles were altered slightly to portray Iran’s adversaries in a poor light. Other content was\ncopied from Iranian state media and used as propaganda to bolster Iran’s profile on the\nnational stage. Of the 70 websites that Reuters uncovered and the 98 identified by ClearSky,\n[the greatest number targeted Yemen, Syria and Afghanistan. Dozens of others targeted the](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-iran-specialreport-idUSKCN1NZ1FT)\nMiddle East and North Africa (MENA) region more generally, where Iran is locked in a\nstruggle for influence with Saudi Arabia.\n\n[This campaign seems to have been broadly aimed at spreading stories around the world that](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-iran-specialreport-idUSKCN1NZ1FT)\nuplift Iranian culture and the Iranian regime and generally denigrate Saudi Arabia, Israel and\nthe United States. For example, Nile Net Online, which purported to be an Egyptian news\n[outlet operating out of Tahrir Square, published several stories criticizing Cairo’s relationship](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-iran-specialreport-idUSKCN1NZ1FT)\nwith the Trump administration. Other sites targeting Muslim majorities in northern African\n[countries, where Iran and Saudi Arabia are fighting for influence, highlighted Saudi Arabia’s](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/05/social-media-network-impersonates-us-political-candidates-supports-iranian-interests.html)\nkilling of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi and criticized its military intervention in Yemen’s civil\nwar. Unlike Russian disinformation, which often aims to create confusion and chaos, this\nmassive Iranian influence campaign demonstrates that Iran’s propaganda is aimed at\nstrategic persuasion.\n\n[Iran also invests heavily in projecting its traditional state media into other Middle Eastern](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/iranian-digital-influence-efforts-guerrilla-broadcasting-for-the-twenty-first-century/)\ncountries, where many audiences are more likely to watch television than access the\ninternet. For example, Iran broadcasts to Arabic speakers across the MENA region with its\nAl-Alam station, to Spanish speakers in Latin America with HispanTV, and to English\nspeakers around the world with Press TV. These outlets are openly run by the Iranian\ngovernment and could be properly classified as public diplomacy, in the vein of the U.S.\ngovernment outlets Voice of America and Radio Free Europe. However, these outlets have\n[also been found to intertwine false stories with real ones, mixing misinformation with its](https://archives.cjr.org/feature/alalams_game.php)\npublic diplomacy.\n\nEven though many countries and regions where these stations are broadcast hold little\n[immediate strategic value to Iran, the regime continues to invest in maintaining a media](https://archives.cjr.org/feature/alalams_game.php)\npresence in order to promote Iran on the world stage and combat negative media broadcasts\nby Iran’s adversaries. However, Al-Alam, HispanTV, and Press TV are all overtly tied to Iran\n[and are therefore vulnerable to U.S. measures to diminish their reach, including designations](https://www.wsj.com/articles/satellite-firms-gets-new-iran-waivers-1409180260)\nand sanctions.\n\nMore covertly, Iran also spends significant resources funding pro-Iranian television stations in\nother countries that are nominally independent. For example, Iran provides funding to at\n[least four Afghan television stations that create pro-Iranian content, according to one Rand](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR600/RR616/RAND_RR616.pdf.)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Corp. report. Iranian influence over these stations is so prominent that Persian words and](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR600/RR616/RAND_RR616.pdf.)\n[Iranian expressions are used even in otherwise Pashto-language programming. Two stations](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR600/RR616/RAND_RR616.pdf.)\n[in particular—Tamadon TV and Noor TV—have been criticized by Afghan officials and](https://www.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-iran-media-idUSL4E8GL3KU20120524)\ncitizens for their entanglement with Iran. Although both have denied any association with the\n[Iranian government, Afghan intelligence publicly accused both of receiving Iranian support.](https://www.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-iran-media-idUSL4E8GL3KU20120524)\nAdditionally, both Noor and Tamadon are members of the IRTVU—one of the entities\nsanctioned by the Treasury Department in October—according to IRTVU’s [website. Although](https://irtvu.com/members.php?id=1)\n[IRTVU does not discuss direct funding on its website, privileges of membership include](https://irtvu.com/article.php?id=375747)\nbenefiting from unspecified IRTVU services and participation in media training and news\nexchanges.\n\nIran’s on- and offline influence operations and propaganda suggest that its global information\nstrategy had little to do with dividing the American public to electioneer in the November U.S.\npresidential race as the ODNI suggested, despite the apparent attempt to scare Americans\n[with the Proud Boys email scam. Of course, Iran has also leveraged narratives that are](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/iranian-digital-influence-efforts-guerrilla-broadcasting-for-the-twenty-first-century/)\npolitically divisive in the U.S., but the purpose is almost always to impugn the reputation of\nthe country’s greatest adversary before a global audience. Unlike Russia, which often\ncreates fake personas taking both sides of an issue to amplify discord and distrust among\nAmericans to undermine democratic institutions, Iranian personas tend to take one side of an\nargument and attempt to persuade a global target audience from that position.\n\n[During the summer of 2020, for example, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly supported](https://iranprimer.usip.org/index.php/blog/2020/jun/02/iranian-officials-and-media-us-unrest)\nBlack Lives Matter in the wake of George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police officers. Iran’s\npurpose in supporting this movement was not to turn Americans against each other but,\nrather, to [denigrate the U.S. government before the American people and the world by](https://iranprimer.usip.org/index.php/blog/2020/jun/02/iranian-officials-and-media-us-unrest)\naccusing it of interfering with other nations around the world while perpetuating injustice at\nhome. This narrative was apparent from Ali Khamenei’s tweets saying, for example, that\n[domestic protests represent “all nations against which the US has committed many](https://twitter.com/khamenei_ir/status/1268106707445731330)\n[atrocities” and “[t]he people of the United States have every right to feel embarrassed and](https://twitter.com/khamenei_ir/status/1268112727282720769)\nashamed by their govts, particularly the current govt.” Iran’s [adoption of a single narrative](https://iranprimer.usip.org/index.php/blog/2020/jun/02/iranian-officials-and-media-us-unrest)\nthat directly attacked the U.S. government and U.S. authorities rather than attacking groups\nof U.S. citizens or taking multiple sides on the issue suggests that its purpose was\npersuasion rather than division.\n\nWhat approach might the ODNI take to Iranian information operations under the Biden\n[administration? Senators on the Intelligence Committee have indicated they are eager to](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russia-china-election-interference-intelligence-assessment/2021/01/08/7dc844ce-5172-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html)\nwork with the current DNI, Avril Haines, to establish more neutral reporting led by rigorous\ntradecraft. A [report by the ODNI’s analytic ombudsman from early January gives some](https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/c3c41863-be9e-4246-9ed9-e43aedd013f9/note/4e677597-f403-4c9b-b838-f5613d79b341.)\nindication of how the agency could publicly report on election interference and reform its\ninternal leadership and tradecraft processes. The report, requested by the Senate\nIntelligence Committee leadership and delivered on Jan. 6, found that internal politicization of\nthe agency’s election interference intelligence led to biased public reporting on Russian and\n\n\n-----\n\nChinese interference efforts. Although reporting on Iran was not specifically addressed, the\nreport’s broad recommendations for reforms from senior agency leadership to line analyst\ntradecraft policies would likely improve the agency’s public reporting on Iran as well.\n\nTags:\n\n[Information Operations](https://www.lawfareblog.com/tagged/information-operations)\n\n\n-----",
