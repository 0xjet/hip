In March 2018, the US DOJ\ncharged nine hackers it believed were behind the group's activity.\n\nDOJ officials said the suspects were \"hackers-for-hire or affiliates of the Mabna Institute, an\nIran-based company that, since at least 2013, conducted a coordinated campaign of cyber\nintrusions,\" at the behest of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), one of the\ncountry's intelligence agencies.\n\nThe nine were charged with carrying out cyber-attacks against 144 US universities and 176\nuniversities in 21 foreign countries, but also attacks against 47 US and foreign companies\nactive in various private sectors.\n\nAccording to court documents, the group primarily targeted universities. A PhishLabs report\n[described the group's modus operandi. Their favorite tactic, albeit not the only one, was to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/iranian-hackers-charged-last-week-were-actually-pretty-damn-good-phishers/)\nuse phishing pages for a university's online library portal.\n\n\n-----\n\nHackers used the collected logins to steal intellectual property from the university s library,\nwhich they later resold online on various portals, such as Megapaper.ir (Megapaper) and\nGigapaper.ir (Gigapaper), two websites operated by a company controlled by one of the\nnine suspects.\n\n## New Cobalt Dickens campaign discovered\n\nBut according to a report shared with Bleeping Computer in advance, US cyber-security\nfirm Secureworks says it detected new phishing attacks carried out by the same Cobalt\nDickens group.\n\nSecureworks researchers say they initially discovered one URL spoofing a login page for a\nuniversity but after further investigations, they uncovered a broader campaign aimed at\nmultiple targets.\n\n\"Sixteen domains contained over 300 spoofed websites and login pages for 76 universities\nlocated in 14 countries, including Australia, Canada, China, Israel, Japan, Switzerland,\nTurkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States,\" revealed Secureworks experts.\n\nThey also say the domains were registered between May and August 2018, a clear\nindicator that the indictment hasn't phased the group's members or forced them\nunderground, as most hackers tend to do after being publicly ousted.\n\nAfter getting run off of [@Namecheap,](https://twitter.com/Namecheap?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#SilentLibrarian actors are now using straight-](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SilentLibrarian?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nup Iranian-hosted websites for their phishing sites.
