The email messages may contain no signatures or\nlogos, with typos and other errors being fairly common. These mailings may target individual\nusers or large corporations, with no significant differences in message content.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Example of a mass malicious mailing message_**\n\nThings have started to change recently, though, as spammers began employing techniques\nthat are typical of targeted attacks. In particular, they have been sending emails in the name\nof real companies, copying the senders’ writing style and signatures.\n\n## Customer email with an Easter egg inside\n\nWe discovered a noteworthy email message recently. In it, someone posing as a Malaysian\nprospect and using a fairly odd variety of English, asks the recipient to review some\ncustomer requirements and get back with the requested documents. The general format\ncomplies with the corporate correspondence standards: there is a logo that belongs to a real\ncompany and a signature that features sender details. Overall, the request looks legit, while\nthe linguistic errors easily can be attributed to the sender being a non-native speaker.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_The email from the Malaysian prospect, with a malicious attachment_**\n\nThe only thing about the email that smells fishy is the sender’s address\n(newsletter@trade***.com), as “newsletter” is typically used for news, not procurement.\nBesides, the sender’s domain name is different from the company name in the logo.\n\nIn another email, a purported Bulgarian customer inquires about the availability of some\nproducts and offers to discuss the details of a deal. The requested products list is said to be\nin the attachment, as in the previous specimen. The sender’s address, similarly suspicious,\nbelongs to a Greek, not Bulgarian, domain, which apparently has no relation to the company\nwhose name is used by the spammers.\n\n**_The email from the “Bulgarian customer,” with a malicious attachment_**\n\nWhat these two messages have in common is both the mailing scenario and the fact that\nneither looks generated by a machine. Looking closely at the message headers, we noticed\nthat they shared a structure: a sequence of headers, MSGID format and email client were\nthe same. Besides, the messages originated within a limited range of IP addresses. This\nsuggested that they were part of one massive email campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Comparing the message headers of two malicious emails_**\n\nUnlike the IP addresses and headers, the content varies. The spammers have been sending\nmalicious archives addressed from a large number of companies, with the “request” text\nchanging as well. This suggests that the operators invested quite some effort into\npreparations, which is uncharacteristic of this kind of campaigns.\n\n## Statistics\n\nFrom April till August, our systems detected 739,749 messages attributed to the campaign.\nThe email activity peaked in June, with 194,100 detected messages, dropping to 178,510 in\nJuly and to 104,991 in August.\n\n_[Malicious email dynamics, April through August 2022 (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2022/09/22155849/01-en-malicious_spam_graphs.png)_\n\n## Payload: Agent Tesla malware\n\nWe studied the contents of the archives attached to the emails, finding it to contain one of\ntwo unique files that belong to the same family. It is the widespread Agent Tesla malware,\nwritten in .NET and known since 2014. Its main objective is to fetch passwords stored in\nbrowsers and other applications, and forward these to the operator. While Agent Tesla most\nfrequently forwards data via email, there are versions that drop the stolen data into a\nTelegram secret chat, on a website operated by the attackers or on an FTP server. The\nAgent Tesla version being spread by the campaign at hand is one the latest, capable of\nripping password from the following applications.\n\nBrowsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, 360 Browser, 7Star, Amigo, Brave,\nCentBrowser, Chedot, Chromium, Citrio, Cốc Cốc, Comodo Dragon, CoolNovo,\nCoowon, Elements Browser, Epic Privacy, Iridium Browser, Kometa, Liebao Browser,\nOrbitum, QIP Surf, Sleipnir 6, Sputnik, Torch Browser, Uran, Vivaldi, Yandex.Browser,\nQQ Browser, Cyberfox, IceDragon, Pale Moon, SeaMonkey, Waterfox, IceCat, KMeleon.\nEmail clients: Becky!, Opera Mail, Foxmail, Thunderbird, Claws, Outlook, The Bat!, eM\nClient, Mailbird, IncrediMail, Postbox, Pocomail\nFTP/SCP clients: WinSCP, WS_FTP, FTPGetter, SmartFTP, FTP Navigator, Core FTP\nDatabases: MySQL Workbench\n\n\n-----\n\nVirtual network computing clients: RealVNC, TightVNC, TigerVNC, UltraVNC, Windows\nRDP, cFTP\nVPN clients: NordVPN, OpenVPN\nInstant messaging programs: Psi/Psi+, Trillian\n\nAgenta Tesla is also capable of making screenshots, intercepting clipboard contents and\nlogging keystrokes.\n\n## Agent Tesla attack geography\n\nAgent Tesla targets users around the world. According to our observations, the malware’s\nactivity from May till August 2022 was the highest in Europe, Asia and Latin America. The\nlargest number of victims (20,941) was recorded in Mexico. It was followed by Spain, with\n18,090 users’ devices registering infection attempts, and Germany, where 14,880 users were\naffected.\n\nTen most-attacked counties by number of affected users:\n\n**Countries/territory** **Users affected**\n\nMexico 20,941\n\nSpain 18,090\n\nGermany 14,880\n\nTurkey 13,326\n\nRussian Federation 12,739\n\nItaly 12,480\n\nMalaysia 10,092\n\nVietnam 9,760\n\nBrazil 8,851\n\nPortugal 8,739\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe spam campaign we discovered is clear proof that cybercriminals can invest significant\neffort even in mass attacks. The email messages we studied appear to be high-quality\nimitations of business inquiries by real companies, only given away by the inappropriate\n\n\n-----\n\nsender addresses. In all likelihood, these emails were composed and sent out manually. That\nsaid, our systems were detecting more than a hundred thousand of these emails each\nmonth, which targeted organizations all around the world.\n\nThe payload spread by the attackers is capable of stealing login data from an imposing\n[number of applications. The data may be offered for sale on darkweb forums or used in](https://securelist.com/initial-access-data-price-on-the-dark-web/106740/)\ntargeted attacks against organizations. Agent Tesla is notably a long-known stealer, detected\nby most cybersecurity products. It is assigned the verdict Trojan-PSW.MSIL.Agensla by\nKaspersky products.\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\n**MD5 hashes of attached archives:**\n\n[ddc607bb993b94c543c63808bebf682a](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/ddc607bb993b94c543c63808bebf682a/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[862adb87b0b894d450f8914a353e3e9c](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/862adb87b0b894d450f8914a353e3e9c/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[a1ae8b0d794af648908e0345204ea192](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/a1ae8b0d794af648908e0345204ea192/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[9d0364e1f625edb286b0d5541bb15357](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/9d0364e1f625edb286b0d5541bb15357/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[eee70de3ac0dc902b99ed33408e646c9](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/eee70de3ac0dc902b99ed33408e646c9/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**MD5 hashes of the executables and details of attackers’ email accounts used for**\n**sending and receiving data stolen by the sample:**\n\n[64011a7871abb873c822b8b99082e8ab](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/64011a7871abb873c822b8b99082e8ab/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\nMail from: info(a)essentialapparatus.co.ke\n\nPassword: Info@2018\n\nMail to: sales1.nuozhongsteel(a)gmail.com\n\nMail server: mail.essentialapparatus.co.ke:587\n\n[b012cb8cfee0062632817d12d43f98b4](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/b012cb8cfee0062632817d12d43f98b4/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\nMail from: quality(a)keeprojects.in\n\nPassword: quality#@!\n\nMail to: quality(a)keeprojects.in\n\nMail server: mail.keeprojects.in:587\n\n[Agent Tesla](https://securelist.com/tag/agent-tesla/)\n[Malicious spam](https://securelist.com/tag/malicious-spam/)\n[Spam Letters](https://securelist.com/tag/spam-letters/)\n[Spammer techniques](https://securelist.com/tag/spammer-techniques/)\n[Thematic spam](https://securelist.com/tag/thematic-spam/)\n[Trojan](https://securelist.com/tag/trojan/)\n[Trojan-stealer](https://securelist.com/tag/trojan-stealer/)\n\nAuthors\n\n\n-----\n\n[Roman Dedenok](https://securelist.com/author/romandedenok/)\n\nArtem Ushkov\n\nMass email campaign with a pinch of targeted spam\n\nYour email address will not be published.
