Based on historical data of named geopolitical actors, the use of destructive payloads\nhas been observed in past campaigns. These destructive payloads aim to disable targeted hosts beyond\n\n\n-----\n\nrecovery and seek to disrupt, deny, and degrade an organization s technology and services, especially\nOperational Technology which is the software and hardware directly related to the monitoring and\noperation of industrial systems (i.e Utilities such as telecommunications, electricity, water, gas, etc).\n\nIf recent Ransomware campaigns are an indication of the effects malicious campaigns against healthcare,\ntechnology, food supply, and gas supply can have in real life (Colonial pipeline outage affected 45% of U.S\nEast Coast fuel supply), then destructive payloads whose sole use is to render hosts unusable should be\nconsidered a possibility under the current geopolitical indicators.\n\n**The Attack: The focus of this threat advisory is on a recently reported destructive payload by Microsoft**\nMSTIC under the name of WhisperGate. We break down the different components and functions of how\nthis payload works and provide a series of detections to mitigate and defend against this threat.\n\nAlthough we cannot prevent patient 0, we can, however, measure and recover execution artifacts which if\nused timely and operationalized as analytics and playbooks can provide analysts a tool to isolate, contain\nand prevent further damage. Further on, this data may help understand the extent and the TTPs of current\nand future campaigns where these payloads may be in use.\n\nRansomware is by itself a destructive payload, however, some past campaigns have shown the use of\nmultiple payloads some of them with Ransomware characteristics used as decoys, and others with the\nsame Ransomware characteristics, however, they execute destructive payloads at targeted organizations\n(i.e Hard disk erasure).\n\n## “WhisperGate” Indicators And Analysis:\n\n Stage 1: MBR Wiper\n\nThis wiper malware contains code that affects the Master Boot Record (MBR) sector of the compromised\nhost. This wiper will try to overwrite or replace the original MBR with the destructive MBR code. The\nscreenshot below shows a code snippet to overwrite the MBR with the malicious master boot record code\ncontaining the ransom note.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Stage2: Discord Downloader\n\n### Delay Of Execution\n\nThis stage 2 malware contains a possible defense evasion that might bypass AV detection technology like\nemulation or even sandbox testing that monitors process behavior in a period of time (let say less than 20\nsec.). The evasion is achieved by running a base64 encoded powershell that will delay its execution. The\nscreenshot below shows the code it runs twice to sleep for 20 sec.\n\n\n-----\n\nEncoded command\n```\nPowershell -enc UwB0AGEAcgB0AC0AUwBsAGUAZQBwACAALQBzACAAMQAwAA==\n\n```\nDecoded command\n```\nPowershell Start-Sleep -s 10\n\n### Discord Download\n\n```\nAfter the sleep, Stage 2 will try to download a “.jpg” file in the discord server. The downloaded file is\nanother .net compiled malware which is the stage 3 that is in reverse form. By using a simple python script\nyou can reverse it to make it a valid PE executable. Below is the screenshot of how it downloads the stage\n3 malware in the discord server.\n\n## Stage 3: Defense Evasion and Process Injection (File Corrupter)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe stage3 is another .net compile malware that will load its resource data to decrypt it, which is the\nadvancedrun.exe and the file corrupter malware.\n\n### Evading Windows Defender AV\n\nAs soon as the stage3 executes, it will drop advancedrun.exe and a vbscript in %temp% folder to evade\nWindows Defender AV. The screenshot below shows how “Advacedrun.exe (Nirsoft Tool) was used to\ndisable WinDefender service and remove or delete Windows Defender directory in Programdata folder.\n```\n“C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AdvancedRun.exe” /EXEFilename\n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\sc.exe” /WindowState 0 /CommandLine “stop WinDefend” /StartDirectory “”\n/RunAs 8 /Run\n“C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AdvancedRun.exe” /EXEFilename \n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe” /WindowState 0 /CommandLine “rmdir \n‘C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender’ -Recurse” /StartDirectory “” /RunAs 8 /Run\n\n```\nThe .vbs file drop in the%temp% folder will add C:\\ drive to the exclusion path of Windows Defender.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Process Injection - File Corrupter Malware\n\nIt will create a suspended process of InstallUtil.exe in %temp% folder to inject the file corrupter malware.\nBelow is the CreateProcess API call for the said file to prepare its injection.\n\nBy Extracting the file that it will inject in InstallUtil.exe using WriteProcessMemory API, we were able to\ngrab the corruptor malware.\n\nThis malware will first enumerate all the drive types connected on the compromised machine. It looks\nspecifically for “Fixed” or “Remote” drives as a starting point in traversing all possible files to corrupt.\n\nIf it finds a file during its enumeration, It will convert its string filename in all capital characters then check if\nthe file extension is in its list. Below is the screenshot of code that checks the file extension and the list of\nits targeted file type.\n\n\n-----\n\nFile extension list\n\n.HTML .HTM .SHTML .XHTML .PHTML .PHP .JSP .ASP .PHPS .PHP5 .ASPX .PHP4 .PHP6 .PHP7\n.PHP3 .DOC .DOCX .XLS .XLSX .PPT .PPTX .PST .OST .MSG .EML .VSD .VSDX .TXT .CSV .RTF\n.WKS .WK1 .PDF .DWG .ONETOC2 .SNT .JPEG .JPG .DOCB .DOCM .DOT .DOTM .DOTX .XLSM\n.XLSB .XLW .XLT .XLM .XLC .XLTX .XLTM .PPTM .POT .PPS .PPSM .PPSX .PPAM .POTX .POTM\n.EDB .HWP .602 .SXI .STI .SLDX .SLDM .BMP .PNG .GIF .RAW .CGM .SLN .TIF .TIFF .NEF .PSD\n.AI .SVG .DJVU.SH .CLASS .JAR .BRD .SCH .DCH .DIP .PL .VB .VBS .PS1 .BAT .CMD .JS .ASM\n.PAS .CPP .CS .SUO .ASC .LAY6 .LAY .MML .SXM .OTG .ODG .UOP .STD .SXD .OTP .ODP .WB2\n.SLK .DIF .STC .SXC .OTS .ODS .3DM .MAX .3DS .UOT .STW .SXW .OTT .ODT .PEM .P12 .CSR\n.CRT .KEY .PFX .DER .OGG .RB .GO .JAVA .INC .WAR .PY .KDBX .INI .YML .PPK .LOG .VDI\n.VMDK .VHD .HDD .NVRAM .VMSD .VMSN .VMSS .VMTM .VMX .VMXF .VSWP .VMTX .VMEM\n.MDF .IBD .MYI .MYD .FRM .SAV .ODB .DBF .DB .MDB .ACCDB .SQL .SQLITEDB .SQLITE3 .LDF\n.SQ3 .ARC .PAQ .BZ2 .TBK .BAK .TAR .TGZ .GZ .7Z .RAR .ZIP .BACKUP .ISO .VCD .BZ .CONFIG\n\nIf the file extension is in its list, it will generate a random value that will serve as the file extension of its\ncorrupted file, then it will mem allocate with size of 0x100000 bytes and fill it with “0xCC” using memset\nAPI. After that it will open the target file, overwrite it with the allocated memory fill of 0xCC bytes and\nrename it with the random generated file extension.\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is the screenshot during the corruption process of this malware, and how it overwrites the file with\n0xCC that makes it not recoverable.\n\n### Ping Sleep and the Melting Batch Script\n\nThis corruptor malware will try to delete itself using the known batch script command like in the screenshot\nbelow. Before that, it also used a ping utility tool to generate sleep for 4-5 sec.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Detections\n\n### Ping Sleep Batch Command\n\nThis analytic will identify the possible execution of ping sleep batch commands. This technique was seen in\nseveral malware samples and is used to trigger sleep times without explicitly calling sleep functions or\ncommandlets. The goal is to delay the execution of malicious code and bypass detection or sandbox\nanalysis.\n```\n| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime\nfrom datamodel=Endpoint.Processes \n where `process_ping` (Processes.parent_process = \"*ping*\" Processes.parent_process = *-n*\nProcesses.parent_process=\"* Nul*\"Processes.parent_process=\"*&gt;*\") OR \n (Processes.process = \"*ping*\" Processes.process = *-n* Processes.process=\"*\nNul*\"Processes.process=\"*&gt;*\")\n by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name\nProcesses.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid\nProcesses.user Processes.dest \n | `drop_dm_object_name(\"Processes\")` \n | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`\n |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)` \n\n### Powershell Remove Windows Defender Directory\n\n```\nThis analytic will identify a suspicious PowerShell command used to delete the Windows Defender folder.\nThis technique was seen used by the WhisperGate malware campaign where it used Nirsoft's\nadvancedrun.exe to gain administrative privileges to then execute a PowerShell  command to delete the\nWindows Defender folder.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n p g g\n | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode Message ComputerName\nUser \n | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`\n | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` \n\n### Suspicious Process With Discord DNS Query\n\n```\nThis analytic identifies a process making a DNS query to Discord, a well known instant messaging and\ndigital distribution platform. Discord can be abused by adversaries, as seen in the WhisperGate campaign,\nto host and download malicious external files. A process resolving a Discord DNS name could be an\nindicator of malware trying to download files from Discord for further execution.\n```\n`sysmon` EventCode=22 QueryName IN (\"*discord*\") process_path != \"*\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Discord\\\\*\"\nAND process_path != \"*\\\\Program Files*\" AND process_name != \"discord.exe\" \n | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image QueryName QueryStatus\nprocess_name QueryResults Computer process_path\n | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`\n | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` \n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Excessive File Deletion In WinDefender Folder\n\nThis analytic will identify excessive file deletion events in the Windows Defender folder. This technique was\nseen in the WhisperGate malware campaign in which adversaries abused Nirsoft's advancedrun.exe to\ngain administrative privilege to then execute PowerShell  commands to delete files within the Windows\nDefender application folder.\n```\n`sysmon` EventCode=23 TargetFilename = \"*\\\\ProgramData\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows Defender*\" \n | stats values(TargetFilename) as deleted_files min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime\ncount by user EventCode Image ProcessID Computer\n |where count >=50\n | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`\n | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` \n\n### Windows InstallUtil in Non Standard Path\n\n```\nThe following analytic identifies the Windows binary InstallUtil.exe running from a non-standard location.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Windows NirSoft AdvancedRun\n\nThe following analytic identifies the use of AdvancedRun.exe. AdvancedRun.exe has similar capabilities as\nother remote programs like psexec.\n\n### Windows DotNet Binary in Non Standard Path\n\nThe following analytic identifies native .net binaries within the Windows operating system that may be\nabused by adversaries by moving it to a new directory.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Splunk Security Content\n\n\n**Name** **Technique**\n**ID**\n\n\n**Tactic** **Description**\n\n\npowershell\nwindows\n[defender](https://research.splunk.com/endpoint/powershell_windows_defender_exclusion_commands/)\nexclusion\ncommands\n\nwindows\ndefender\nexclusion\nregistry entry\n\nexecutables\nor script\n[creation in](https://research.splunk.com/endpoint/executables_or_script_creation_in_suspicious_path/)\nsuspicious\npath\n\n\n[T1562.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001/) Defense\nEvasion\n\n[T1562.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001/) Defense\nEvasion\n\n[T1036](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/) Defense\nEvasion\n\n\nThis analytic will detect a suspicious process commandline related to windows defender exclusion feature.\n\nThis analytic will detect a suspicious process that modifies\na registry related to windows defender exclusion feature.\n\nThis analytic will identify suspicious executable or scripts\n(known file extensions) in a list of suspicious file paths in\nWindows.
