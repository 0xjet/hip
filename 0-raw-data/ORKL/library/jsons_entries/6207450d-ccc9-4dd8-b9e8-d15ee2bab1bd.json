Apart from](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/02/kasablanka-lodarat.html)\nupdates to the Windows version of this malware, the researchers also found Android\nmalware (‘Loda4Android’) written by the same group. They link both versions of the\nmalware to an ongoing campaign targeting people or entities in Bangladesh.\n\nThis blog post reveals some further infrastructure used in this campaign.\n\n## LodaRAT\n\nLodaRAT, or Loda, is information gathering malware. It has the ability to take screenshots of\ninfected machines, record keystrokes and sound and allows its operators to send\ncommands to the machine. It was [first analysed by Proofpoint in May 2017.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/introducing-loda-malware)\n\nIn most of its campaigns, LodaRAT has been spreading through malicious documents, that\neither contained malicious macros or exploited vulnerabilities in Office. Some earlier\ncampaigns exploited CVE-2017-0199, while more recent ones exploited CVE-2017-11882.\nThough patched several years ago, the latter vulnerability remains popular among malware\nauthors.\n\nAmong the indicators of compromise shared by Talos is the domain lap-top[.]xyz, from\nwhich a malicious APK file was served. This domain was registered in October and points\nto 134.122.120[.]22, an IP address belonging to the popular cloud infrastructure provider\nDigital Ocean.\n\nWhile looking in Silent Push’s database for other domains that have pointed to this IP\naddress, I noticed two that turned out to be actively serving LodaRAT: corona-bd[.]com and\nimei[.]today.\n\n## Using the COVID-19 vaccine as a lure\n\n\n-----\n\nAt first glance, corona-bd[.]com looks like an official Bangladeshi government website with\ninformation on the coronavirus. That’s not surprising, because in an iframe it contains that\nvery website, hosted at corona.gov.bd.\n\nBut right above the iframe, there is a grey bar with the Bengali text “�থমধােপ অ�ািধকার\nিভি�েত কেরানা ভাইরােসর িটকা পাওয়ার আেবদন করেত এখােন ি�ক ক�ন।” which Google helped me\ntranslate to “Click here to apply for the corona virus vaccine on a first-come, first-served\nbasis.”\n\n_The real Bangladeshi government website (left) and the fake one with an extra link on top_\n_(right)_\n\nThis link goes to a form that asks for many personal details, some of which (such as\n“Freedom Fighter Status”) may appear unusual for non-Bangladeshis. Upon filling in the\nform, you are presented with a page telling you your application has been accepted. It is\nunclear whether the information filled in the form is used in some way, but JavaScript\ncarefully checks you have filled everything in, after which it is submitted to the server in a\nPOST request.\n\nOnce you have submitted the form, you are urged to download the a copy of the\napplication. Apart from a receipt number, which is different every time the page loads, you\nare given a password to open the application. The application turns out to be a zip file\nprotected with this password and inside is a variant of LodaRAT (SHA256:\ne78546bb33df88c6be3afce32f5d13084295a6e0599b26c3b380d54318170d86).\n\nI don’t know how people end up on this website: whether it relies on natural traffic, or\nwhether the campaign urges specific targets to visit it, but the context of the campaign and\nthe apparent lack of public links to it make the latter more likely.\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, the domain corona-bd[.]com had been active many years ago, when it hosted\nthe [website of a fashion company. Last spring, it was registered again to serve information](https://web.archive.org/web/20140402213144/http://corona-bd.com/)\nrelated to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFrom the [copy on the Wayback Machine, I can’t determine any malicious purpose of this](https://web.archive.org/web/20200424074119/http://corona-bd.com/)\nwebsite, but it shared an IP address with a number of domains that Talos also linked to this\ncampaign, so it is likely that the same actor was hosting it already. This would suggest this\ncampaign, or at least preparations for it, started well before October.\n\n## Fake IMEI checker\n\nThe second domain, imei[.]today, hosts what appears to be a checker for IMEIs: numbers\nthat uniquely identify mobile phones.\n\nThe page lay-out is largely copied from the legitimate site imei.info, but made to look to\nbelong to the BTRC, the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission. This site\nthus too targets Bangladesh, even if it is written in English, a language however still widely\nunderstood in the country.\n\n_Legitimate (left) and malicitious (right) IMEI checker_\n\n[Upon entering a valid IMEI number (client-side JavaScript performs the ‘Luhn check’), the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)\nuser is served a zip file. Inside this zip file, which this time is not protected with a password,\nis another variant of LodaRAT (SHA256:\ncf29981bfec0f0cf2abd54ae469c8795a3cf1e19c715ded329fdb2707f982407).\n\n## Other domains\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile I found these domains because both have used the IP address 134.122.120[.]22,\nthey have in fact shared several more IP addresses. And there are several more domains\nthat have used some of these addresses in recent months.\n\nOne is mybnp[.]club. This site looks near identical to bnpbd.org, the website of the\nBangladesh Nationalist Party (a Bangladeshi political party), from which it includes most\ncontent. The only difference is a line on top that says (in Bengali) “Click here to register to\nbecome a member of the BNP” that links to a signup page. This signup page contains an\niframe that loads content from http://educationboardresults[.]net/php/application/.\n\nHowever, there is no content there: educationboardresults[.]net is a parked domain.\nMoreover, mybnp[.]club does not render well in most modern browsers, due to mixed\ncontent errors. It may be that this site was intended to be used in the campaign but then\nabandoned.\n\nOther domains that have used IP addresses in the same set include av24[.]co and\nbracbank[.]info, both of which were mentioned by Talos, but also bkash[.]club,\nbkashagent[.]com, aktel[.] org and zepode[.]online. All of these are relevant to\nBangladeshis: bKash is a mobile financial service in Bangladesh, AKTEL is the former\nname of a mobile phone provider in Bangladesh, and Zepode is an ecommerce platform\npopular in the region.\n\n_Information on aktel[.]org_ _on Silent Push’s dashboard._\n\nApart from using some of the same IP addresses, all of these domains use two\nnameservers ns1.domain and ns2.domain with domain the domain itself and both name\nservers pointing to the same IP address as the domain's A recor, a somewhat peculiar setup.\n\n\n-----\n\nI had not been able to find any content hosted on these latter four domains, but that does\nnot mean URLs with malware don’t exist. It is also possible that these have been registered\nfor future use in this campaign.\n\n## A hacker-for hire campaign?\n\n[Writing about the discovery of LodaRAT activity in Bangladesh, Cyberscoop suggests it](https://www.cyberscoop.com/android-spying-bangladesh-talos/)\nmight belong to a hacker-for-hire group.\n\nLast year, several hacker-for-hire operations (sometimes referred to as ‘cyber mercenaries’)\nhave been uncovered. Such groups make cyber-espionage capabilities available to\ncompanies, political organisations as well as nation states without their own offensive cyber\ncapabilities.\n\nLodaRAT’s activity has all the hallmarks of such an operation. First, the geographic spread\nof the activities: Talos believes the group is based in Morocco (which is why it is referred to\nas ‘Kasablanka’) and previous activity by this group was linked to Latin America, while this\n[campaign targets Bangladesh. The Android malware used by this group has been linked to](https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/Blade-hawk-The-activities-of-targeted-the-Middle-East-and-West-Asia-are-exposed/)\ncampaigns in the Middle East.\n\nSecondly, the malware focuses on gathering information rather than on direct financial gain,\nwhich would be common for malware used by a more traditional cybercrime group.\n\nAnd thirdly, this particular campaign appears fairly targeted. While the real size can’t be\ndetermined without global telemetry, a more widespread campaign would have likely left\npublic traces through search engines and public thread feeds.\n\nOf course, none of this is conclusive proof of the kind of operation this is. Nor does it mean\nthat the authors of the malware are the same as the ones conducting this campaign.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMalware and phishing campaigns make a serious effort to stay under the radar. However,\nlimited resources forces threat actors to reuse infrastructure.\n\nIn this case, with the help of Silent Push’s API, I was able to use this weakness to uncover\nmore infrastructure used by the ‘Kasablanka’ actor in its targeting of Bangladesh, based on\na few publicly posted indicators.\n\n_With contributions from Ken Bagnall and Nick Kostopoulos._\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Domain names\n\n\n-----\n\naktel[.]org\nbkashagent[.]com\nbkash[.]club\ncorona-bd[.]com\nimei[.]today\nmybnp[.]club\nzepode[.]online\n\nAlso likely linked to this campaign because of shared infrastructure and similar set up, but\nwith no apparent Bangladesh link:\n\nc0mputer[.]xyz\npiramidewebs[.]com\n\n### IP addresses\n\n94.130.110[.]78\n\n107.180.72[.]97\n\n107.180.73[.]34\n\n107.180.73[.]135\n\n116.203.37[.]39\n\n134.122.120[.]22\n\nOf these, 94.130.110[.]78 had a PTR record set to be vps.corona-bd[.]com, while\n134.122.120[.]22 used vps.lap-top[.]xyz as a PTR record. This confirms that at least these\ntwo IP addresses are or were attacker owned rather than shared hosting space.\n\nSome other IP addresses that the domains have pointed to were shared with too many\nunrelated domains to considered them reliable indicators for this domain, or for malicious\nactivity in general; hence they have not been listed.\n\n### SHA256 hashes of LodaRAT variants\n\ncf29981bfec0f0cf2abd54ae469c8795a3cf1e19c715ded329fdb2707f982407\n\ne78546bb33df88c6be3afce32f5d13084295a6e0599b26c3b380d54318170d86\n\n## Subscribe\n\nSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.\n\nWe respect your privacy.\n\nThank you!\n\n[Ken Bagnall](http://10.10.0.46/blog?author=6081bc3c4920d358398731f8)\n\n\n-----",
