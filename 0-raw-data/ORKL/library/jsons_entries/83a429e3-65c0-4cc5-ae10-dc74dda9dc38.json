They both share a\nsimilar story: they were taken down and made a comeback. Check Point Research (CPR)\nobserved Trickbot’s activities after the takedown operation and recently noticed it started to\nspread Emotet samples – which was intriguing because Emotet was considered dead for the\npast 10 months.\n\nTrickbot was one of the most massive botnets in 2020, only outmatched by Emotet. In an\neffort to take down Trickbot, different vendors worked together to take down 94% of core\nservers crucial for Trickbot operations in October 2020. It has been 11 months since Trickbot\nwas takedown, but this botnet has held 1 place in the list of the most prevalent malwarest\n[families in May,](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/06/10/check-point-softwares-may-2021-most-wanted-malware-dridex-drops-from-list-while-trickbot-rises-to-top/) [June and](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/07/13/june-2021s-most-wanted-malware-trickbot-remains-on-top/) [September 2021. Over the last 11 months, Check Point Research](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/10/08/september-2021s-most-wanted-malware-trickbot-once-again-tops-the-list/)\n(CPR) has spotted over 140,000 Trickbot victims worldwide, involving more than 200\ncampaigns and thousands of IP addresses on compromised and dedicated machines.\n\n\n-----\n\nTrickbot is a botnet and banking Trojan written in C++ that can steal financial details, account\ncredentials and personally identifiable information. It can spread within a network and drop\nvarious payloads. Trickbot has utilized sophisticated coding technique evasions and due to\nits flexibility and modular structure, it’s an attractive collaboration option for other malware\nattacks.\n\nTrickbot has been involved in different ransomware campaigns such as infamous Ryuk and\nConti attacks. Trickbot is constantly being updated with new capabilities, features and\ndistribution vectors, which enables it to be a flexible and customizable malware that can be\ndistributed as part of multi-purpose campaigns. It is known since 2016 and is continuing to\nlive and evolve 5 years later despite even the most serious attempts to disrupt the botnet,\nlike the one in October 2020.\n\nRecently CPR noticed that Trickbot infected machines started to drop Emotet samples, for\nthe first time since the takedown of Emotet in January 2021. This research will analyze the\nTrickbot malware, describe its activity after the takedown, and explain why Emotet chose\nTrickbot when it came to Emotet’s rebirth. We will also dive into the technical details of\nEmotet infection.\n\n## Trickbot history\n\nTrickbot appeared in 2016 as a successor of Dyre malware, whose operators were arrested\nby the Russian authorities. There were a lot of [code similarities between the two malware](https://fidelissecurity.com/threatgeek/archive/trickbot-we-missed-you-dyre/)\nfamilies. Since then, Trickbot has lived its own life. Instead of embedding all the functionality\ninside the malware, the authors decided to spread it throughout numerous modules which\n[could be updated dynamically. This decision resulted in over 20 Trickbot modules, each of](https://securelist.com/trickbot-module-descriptions/104603/)\nthem responsible for a separate functionality: lateral movement, stealing of browsers’\ncredentials, installing proxy reverse module and so on. Not all of the modules were written in\nC++, some of them were written with Delphi which may be a sign of an outsource\ndevelopment services used by Trickbot authors.\n\nThe damage caused by Trickbot became a hot topic in the news. For example, in July 2019 a\n[database was discovered with 250 million emails used by Trickbot operators in their](https://www.deepinstinct.com/blog/trickbooster-trickbots-email-based-infection-module)\ncampaigns. Trickbot actors adapted to global changes and used priority issues such as BLM\nand COVID-19 to trick users into opening emails with malicious attachments. At the peak of\nits activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trickbot achieved a milestone of 240 million\nspam messages per day. Another means of spreading was through links to malicious\nwebsites.\n\nIn 2020, Trickbot (together with Emotet) was used to deliver Ryuk ransomware and caused\n[massive damage. Universal Health Services reported that the company suffered $67 million](https://www.safernetvpn.com/universal-health-services-report-67-million-loss-to-ryuk-ransomware/)\n[losses because of the Ryuk attack. According to the researches, crypto wallets used for](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/ryuk-ransomware-profits-150-million-a-15726)\nransom in Ryuk attacks were topped for $150 million.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere was the evidence that Trickbot actors united their efforts with APTs. In December\n[2019, the infamous North Korean Lazarus group was spotted to use the attack framework](https://threatpost.com/lazarus-collaborates-trickbots-anchor-project/151000/)\n[called Anchor Project. Anchor Project is a backdoor module used by Trickbot which is](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/dropping-anchor)\ndeployed only to selected high-profile victims.\n\nConstant participation of Trickbot in high-profile attacks that caused great damage led to\nunprecedented effort from major security companies – ESET, Microsoft, Symantec – to\nattempt and takedown the Trickbot botnet, with the help of telecom providers. The time was\nright before the US presidential elections as the involved parties did not want to take risks\n[and let millions of Trickbot-infected machines interfere with the election process.](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20201015-trickbot-and-its-one-million-zombie-computers-us-election-under-threat)\n\nThis effort should have put the end to the Trickbot threat, but alas it did not. Trickbot\noperators re-grouped, found new ways to continue their operations and despite the losses in\ntheir ranks, did not give up their evil intentions.\n\n## Connections to other malware in 2021\n\nDuring its lifecycle, Trickbot has been continuously linked to different malware families as the\nmeans of spreading them. Ryuk ransomware or BazarBackdoor, for example – and that’s\njust some of the malware families delivered by Trickbot. The situation did not change after\nthe botnet takedown in October 2020. Trickbot has been involved in one of the most serious\nransomware attacks in 2021.\n\nOn September 22, 2021, the FBI [released an advisory that provided a detailed description](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-265a)\nabout the group behind Conti ransomware. There are several mentions of Trickbot in this\npaper claiming it was one of the means of ransomware delivery to victims’ machines. Conti\n[ransomware is a serious threat. As stated in the FBI report, there were around 400](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/210521.pdf)\norganizations worldwide affected by Conti, 290 of which were located in the USA. FBI\nidentified various attack vectors including high-profile ones: healthcare and first responder\nnetworks, law enforcement agencies, emergency medical services, 9-1-1 dispatch centers,\nand municipalities.\n\n## Targets\n\nAfter botnet takedown, Trickbot’s activity rate was persistent (reflected in the chart below):\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 – Trickbot dynamic of infected machines since November 1, 2020_\n\nCheck Point Research spotted over 140,000 victims affected by Trickbot globally since the\nbotnet takedown, including organizations and individuals. To understand how big this number\nis, we can compare it with 400 organizations reportedly affected by Conti ransomware\naccording to FBI. 140,000 victims are 350 times more than that sound attack of 400\norganizations where Trickbot was involved for spreading the ransomware.\n\nTrickbot affected 149 countries in total which is more than 75% of all the countries in the\nworld. As shown in figure two, almost one third of all Trickbot targets were located in Portugal\nand the USA:\n\n\n_Figure 1 – Trickbot dynamic of infected machines since November 1, 2020_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 – Trickbot victims since November 1, 2020 grouped by countries_\n\nThe following graphs shows the distribution of victims by industry:\n\n_Figure 3 – Trickbot victims since November 1, 2020 grouped by industries_\n\nVictims from high profile industries constitute more than 50% of all the victims which speaks\nonce again about the effectiveness of Trickbot.\n\n## Campaigns\n\nResearchers spotted 223 different Trickbot campaigns in the last 6 months. However, 129\nout of 223 campaigns stopped their activity in July.\n\n\n_Figure 2 – Trickbot victims since November 1, 2020 grouped by countries_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 – Number of campaigns (vertical) that were last observed in the particular months (horizontal)_\n\nIt may seem that Trickbot activity has dropped in scale, but combined with all the other facts\nwe can conclude quite the opposite. The campaigns became more massive and widely\ntargeted as the number of victims continues to grow despite the drop in the number of\ncampaigns.\n\nThere are two campaigns that stand out because of the number of IP addresses they use.\nCampaign with identifier “zev4” has been using 79 IP addresses during the time of its\nactivity, whilst campaign “zem1” – just slightly less, 64 different IP addresses.\nThis may be a sign of Trickbot continuing growth as these campaigns are fresh.\n“zev4” was first seen on July 26 and is still active today. “th **_zem1” was a short term campaign_**\nthat was seen for 3 days only from September 13 to September 15 . No other campaignsth th\nuse more than 50 IP addresses. However, 37 of them (not counting the 2 campaigns above)\nuse more than 40 different IP addresses.\n\n\n_Figure 4 – Number of campaigns (vertical) that were last observed in the particular months (horizontal)_\n\n\nThe breakdown of total number of campaigns that use the number of IP addresses by\nintervals is shown on the following diagram:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 – number of campaigns (vertical) using that many unique IP addresses (horizontal)_\n\nThis information may be interpreted the following way: although the Trickbot attacks a wide\nrange of victims, it relies on a relatively small number of IP addresses. Some of them are\ntime-tested and trustful, as we will see in the next chapter.\n\n## Network infrastructure\n\nWe tracked a total of 1061 unique non-encrypted IP addresses used in Trickbot campaigns,\nwith 1115 unique combinations of ip:port.There are 8 addresses used in as many as 61\ncampaigns, all on 443 port:\n\n**IP** **Country** **Organization**\n\n24.162.214.166 USA Charter Communications Inc\n\n45.36.99.184 USA Charter Communications Inc\n\n60.51.47.65 Malaysia –\n\n62.99.76.213 Spain Euskaltel S.A.\n\n82.159.149.52 Spain Vodafone ONO, S.A.\n\n97.83.40.67 USA Charter Communications Inc\n\n103.105.254.17 Indonesia PT Bintang Mataram Teknologi\n\n184.74.99.214 USA Charter Communications Inc\n\nAll the IP addresses from the list have been used for at least 5 months to date\n\n## Emotet rebirth\n\n\n_Figure 5 – number of campaigns (vertical) using that many unique IP addresses (horizontal)_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Emotet botnet, once an overbearing threat that held more than 1.5 million machines\nunder its sway, was capable of infecting those machines with additional bankers, trojans and\n[ransomware. Its estimated damage was around 2 and a half billion dollars. Emotet is a long](https://www.wired.com/story/emotet-botnet-takedown/)\nterm malware and operates with some breaks and pauses since 2014, it was very widely\nspread before takedown affecting more than 1.5 million machines all around the world. It was\nfamous for spreading other malware families including Trickbot, Ryuk ransomware and\nothers.\n\nEmotet was [taken down last January by a joint operation of various law enforcement](https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action)\nagencies and judicial authorities worldwide.\n\n_Figure 6 – Law authorities that participated in Emotet takedown (image from europol.europa.eu)_\n\nHundreds of security researchers worldwide cheered for its takedown and the thought of an\nEmotet free world. However, on November 15th, merely 10 months after its takedown,\nTrickbot infected machines started to drop Emotet samples. The newly Emotet infected\nmachines began spreading once again, by a strong malspam campaign promoting users to\ndownload password protect zip files, which contained malicious documents that once ran\nand macros are enabled infects the computer with Emotet, causing the infection cycle to\nrepeat and enabling Emotet to rebuild its botnet network. Emotet could not choose a better\nplatform than Trickbot as a delivery service when it came to Emotet’s rebirth question.\n\nSince we spotted the Emotet comeback in November, we observed a volume of its activity\nwhich is at least 50% of the level we saw in January 2021, before Emotet had been taken\ndown. This upwards trend continues throughout December as well.\n\nWith 10 months of downtown, Emotet has upgraded its operation and added some new tricks\nto its toolbox. Using Elliptic curve cryptography instead of RSA cryptography, improving its\ncontrol flow flatting methods, adding to the initial infection by using malicious Windows app\ninstaller packages that imitate legitimate software and more.\n\nBesides using Trickbot for dropping its samples, Emotet also sticks to the probed scheme of\nbeing distributed via malicious documents. Below we take a look at the details of Emotet\ninfection conducted with the help of malicious documents.\n\n## Downloading the Emotet payload via maldocs\n\n\n_Figure 6 – Law authorities that participated in Emotet takedown (image from europol.europa.eu)_\n\n\n-----\n\nWe analyzed the malicious Excel document with the following hash:\n```\n800f6f0cbc307b6d39dd48563fb2a15a2119a76d97ec599f0995e3c4af0b2211 .\n\n```\nThis file is loaded from several sources, according to VirusTotal, the date it appeared on\nVirusTotal is 2021-11-16:\n\n_Figure 7 – Analyzed file on VirusTotal_\n\nThe script inside the document uses Powershell to download the payload.\n\n_Figure 8 – Malicious URLs inside PowerShell script_\n\nThe script downloads Windows PE binaries to the “C:\\ProgramData” folder from the following\nlocations:\n\n\n_Figure 7 – Analyzed file on VirusTotal_\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nhttps://av-quiz.tk/wp-content/k6K/\n\n```\n```\nhttps://goodtech.cetxlabs.com/content/5MfZPgP06/\n\n```\n\nIf the payload is downloaded successfully the binary is spawned and the script stops\nchecking other URLs from the given list. One of the Emotet payloads downloaded this way\nthe following hash:\n```\n3f57051e3b62c87fb24df0fdc4b30ee91fd73d3cee3a6f7a962efceba2e99c7d .\n\n```\nEmotet is not a threat to be taken lightly, as seen in the past it can grow to monstrous scope.\nThe return can also cause an increase in ransomware attacks as Emotet is known to drop\nvarious ransomware in the past.\n\nWe will continue monitoring it, keeping our products on par with its newest infection methods.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBotnet takedown sounds strong as a term, but in reality taking down a botnet is easier than\nmaintaining a botnet in de-activated state. Our data shows that Trickbot is very much alive\nsince the takedown and is continuing to evolve. With Emotet back and using the Trickbot\nmalware as a delivery service, the malware landscape is doing its best to be as threatening\nand effective as possible.\n\nWe are constantly monitoring these and other threats and protect our customers.\n\n## Check Point Protections\n\n[Check Point Software provides Zero-Day Protection across Its Network, Cloud, Users and](https://www.checkpoint.com/infinity-vision/zero-day-protection/)\nAccess Security Solutions, Check Point Harmony provides the best zero-day protection while\nreducing security overhead\n\nCheck Point Harmony Network Protections:\n\n```\nTrojan-Banker.Win32.TrickBot\n\n```\n\nThreat Emulation protections:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nTS_Worm.Win32.Emotet.TC.*\n\n```\n```\nTrojan.Win32.Emotet.TC.*\n\n```\n\n## IOCs\n\nThe lists below are not excessive by any means.\n\n## Trickbot Hashes\n\n```\n3d5853ab9ec4e2b24bf328dc526e09975d1b266f1684bbbc8f8e3292a1c3f2d0\n\n```\n\n## Emotet Hashes\n\n```\n800f6f0cbc307b6d39dd48563fb2a15a2119a76d97ec599f0995e3c4af0b2211\n\n```\n```\n3f57051e3b62c87fb24df0fdc4b30ee91fd73d3cee3a6f7a962efceba2e99c7d\n\n```\n\n## Trickbot IP addresses\n\n```\n184.74.99.214\n\n```\n\n## URLs with Emotet Payload\n\n```\nhttp[://ranvipclub.net/pvhko/a/\n\n```\n```\nhttp[://apps.identrust.com/roots/dstrootcax3.p7c\n\n```\n```\nhttp[://visteme.mx/shop/wp-admin/PP/\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nhttp[://av-quiz.tk/wp-content/k6K/\n\n```\n```\nhttp[://ranvipclub.net/pvhko/a/\n\n```\n```\nhttps[://goodtech.cetxlabs.com/content/5MfZPgP06/\n\n```\n```\nhttps[://newsmag.danielolayinkas.com/content/nVgyRFrTE68Yd9s6/\n\n```\n\n## Resources\n\n Trickbot before takedown\n\n1.
