Bennett](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research.html/category/etc/tags/fireeye-blog-authors/michael-bailey)\n\n_Update (April 30): Following the release of our four-part CARBANAK Week blog series, many_\n_readers have found places to make the data shared in these posts actionable. We have updated_\n_this post to include some of this information._\n\n[In the previous installment, we wrote about how string hashing was used in CARBANAK to](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/04/carbanak-week-part-one-a-rare-occurrence.html)\nmanage Windows API resolution throughout the entire codebase. But the authors used this\nsame string hashing algorithm for another task as well. In this installment, we’ll pick up\nwhere we left off and write about CARBANAK’s antivirus (AV) detection, AV evasion,\nauthorship artifacts, exploits, secrets, and network-based indicators.\n\n#### Antivirus Evasions\n\nSource code unquestionably accelerates analysis of string hashes. For example, the\nfunction AVDetect in AV.cpp iterates processes to detect AV by process name hash as shown\nin Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Antivirus detection by process name hash\n\nWhat does CARBANAK do with this information? It evades AV according to what is installed.\nFigure 2 shows the code for an AVG evasion that the authors disabled by commenting it out.\nBased on this, it appears as if the AVG evasion was retired, but FLARE team member Ryan\nWarns confirmed in November 2017 that it still worked with one minor tweak. FLARE\ndisclosed this to AVG immediately upon confirming it. Avast indicates that after our\ndisclosure, they updated the affected DLL to ignore DLL_PROCESS_DETACH and leave its\nhooks in place.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Commented out source code to unload AVG user-space hooks\n\nIn November of 2017, FLARE also disclosed an evasion for Trend Micro’s detection of\nprocess injection that remained active in the CARBANAK source code. The evasion mirrors a\n[technique used in Carberp that replaces remote heap allocation and a call](https://github.com/hzeroo/Carberp/blob/master/source - absource/pro/all source/RemoteCtl/hvnc2/core/svchost_inj.cpp#L8)\nto CreateRemoteThread with memory mapping and queueing of an asynchronous\nprocedure call via QueueUserAPC. Following our disclosure, Trend Micro indicated that they\nhad updated their behavior monitoring rules and released OfficeScan XG SP1 in December\n2017 with a new “Aggressive Event” detection feature that covers this behavior.\n\n#### Author Characterization\n\nHaving source code could pose unique opportunities to learn about the individuals behind\nthe keyboard. To that end, I searched for artifacts in the source code dump that might point\nto individuals. I found the most information in Visual Studio solution files. Most of these\nreferenced drive O: as the source root, but I did find the following host paths:\n\nC:\\Users\\hakurei reimu\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\nC:\\Users\\Igor\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\nE:\\Projects\\progs\\Petrosjan\\WndRec\\...\nE:\\Projects\\progs\\sbu\\WndRec\\...\n\nUnfortunately, these data points don’t yield many answers. If they are observed in later\nartifacts, connections might be inferred, but as of this writing, not much else is known about\nthe authors.\n\n#### Source Code Survey\n\nThe CARBANAK source code contained numerous exploits, previous C2 hosts, passwords,\nand key material. I decided to comprehensively search these out and determine if they led\nto any new conclusions or corroborated any previous observations.\n\nExploits\n\n\n-----\n\nI wanted to know if the CARBANAK authors wielded any exploits that were not publicly\ndisclosed. To the contrary, I found all the exploits to be well-documented. Table 1 breaks out\nthe escalation code I reviewed from the CARBANAK source code dump.\n\n**Name** **CVE** **Notes**\n\nPathRec 2013- [Exploit proof of concept (poc) from May 2013](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25611)\n3660\n\nSdrop 2013- [Exploit poc from June 2013](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25912)\n3660\n\nNDProxy 2013- [NDProxy.sys exploit originally authored by secniu](http://www.secniu.com/ndproxy-local-system-exploitcve-2013-5065/)\n5065\n\nUACBypass [UAC bypass by DLL hijacking found in Carberp](https://github.com/hzeroo/Carberp/blob/master/source - absource/pro/all source/BJWJ/source/exploit/UAC_bypass.cpp)\n\nCOM UAC bypass by disabling elevation prompts and dialogs via the\nIFileOperation COM interface\n\nCVE-2014- 2014- [Win32k.sys exploit derived from code that can be found online](https://ideone.com/fork/ByJlWj)\n4113 4113\n\nBlackEnergy2 [AppCompat shim-based UAC bypass](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-14/materials/Erickson/Asia-14-Erickson-Persist-It-Using-And-Abusing-Microsofts-Fix-It-Patches.pdf)\n\nEUDC 2010- [UAC bypass by EUDC exploitation](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2010-4398)\n4398\n\nTable 1: Exploits for elevation found in CARBANAK source code\n\n[The CARBANAK source code also contains code copied wholesale from Mimikatz including](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)\nthe sekurlsa module for dumping passwords from lsass.exe and Terminal Services patching\ncode to allow multiple remote desktop protocol connections.\n\nSecrets\n\nMy analysis included an audit of passwords and key material found in the source code and\naccompanying binaries. Although many of these were used for debug versions, I curated\nthem for reference in case a need might arise to guess future passwords based on\npasswords used in the source code. Table 2 shows recovered passwords used for RC2\n|Name|CVE|Notes|\n|---|---|---|\n|PathRec|2013- 3660|Exploit proof of concept (poc) from May 2013|\n|Sdrop|2013- 3660|Exploit poc from June 2013|\n|NDProxy|2013- 5065|NDProxy.sys exploit originally authored by secniu|\n|UACBypass||UAC bypass by DLL hijacking found in Carberp|\n|COM||UAC bypass by disabling elevation prompts and dialogs via the IFileOperation COM interface|\n|CVE-2014- 4113|2014- 4113|Win32k.sys exploit derived from code that can be found online|\n|BlackEnergy2||AppCompat shim-based UAC bypass|\n|EUDC|2010- 4398|UAC bypass by EUDC exploitation|\n\n\n-----\n\nencrypted communications and other purposes along with the corresponding name in the\nsource code and their status as they were encountered (active in source code, commented\nout, or compiled into a binary).\n\n**Credential Identifier Per Source Code** **Password** **Status**\n\nADMIN_PASSWORD 1He9Psa7LzB1wiRn Active\n\nADMIN_PASSWORD 1234567812345678 Commented out\n\nADMIN_PASSWORD cbvhX3tJ0k8HwnMy Active\n\nADMIN_PASSWORD 1234567812345678 Commented out\n\nN/A 1234567812345678 Compiled\n\nTable 2: Passwords found in CARBANAK source code and binaries\n\nI found an encrypted server certificate in a debug directory. This seemed like it could\nprovide a new network-based indicator to definitively tie operations together or catch new\nactivity. It was trivial to brute force this container by adapting a publicly available code\nsample of X509 handling in C# to cycle through passwords in a popular password list. The\npassword was found in less than 1 second because it was the single-character password “1”.\nThe certificate turns out to be for testing, hence the weak password.

We were able to notify vendors about disclosures that\nspecifically targeted their security suites. The previously documented NBIs, Windows API\nfunction resolution, backdoor command hash values, usage of Windows cabinet file APIs,\nand other artifacts associated with CARBANAK all match, and as they say, if the shoe fits,\nwear it. Interestingly though, the project itself isn’t called CARBANAK or even Anunak as the\ninformation security community has come to call it based on the string artifacts found\nwithin the malware. The authors mainly refer to the malware as “bot” in the Visual Studio\nproject, filenames, source code comments, output binaries, user interfaces, and manuals.\n\nThe breadth and depth of this analysis was a departure from the usual requests we receive\n\n\n-----\n\non the FLARE team. The journey included learning some Russian, searching through a\nhundred thousand of lines of code for new information, and analyzing a few dozen binaries.\nIn the end, I’m thankful I had the opportunity to take this request.\n\n[In the next post, Tom Bennett takes the reins to provide a retrospective on his and Barry](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/04/carbanak-week-part-three-behind-the-backdoor.html)\n[Vengerik’s previous analysis in light of the source code.
