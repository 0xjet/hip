Analysis show the group uses about a dozen\nlive C&C servers for extremely narrow targeted malware campaigns against companies in the Middle East, the U.S., and Asia.\n\nBy: Feike Hacquebord, Cedric Pernet, Kenney Lu December 12, 2019 Read time: ( words)\n\n_This article is part of a research paper that dives into cyberattacks on the oil and gas industry. It provides a more_\n_[comprehensive look at APT33 and other critical threats. Read the full paper here.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/internet-of-things/drilling-deep-a-look-at-cyberattacks-on-the-oil-and-gas-industry)_\n\n_This blog was originally published on November 13, 2019. Updated on November 27, 2019 at 11:00 PM PST to add new_\n_information about a C&C domain._\n\n[The threat group regularly referred to as APT33 is known to](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0064/) [target the oil and aviation industries aggressively. This threat group](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/mideast/iran-linked-hackers-hit-oil-aviation-firms-u-s-saudi-n802716)\n[has been reported on](https://www.wired.com/story/iran-hackers-us-phishing-tensions/) [consistently for years, but our recent findings show that the group has been using about a dozen live](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/09/20/iran-hacker-crew-apt33-heading-for-destructive-cyberattacks/)\nCommand and Control (C&C) servers for extremely narrow targeting. The group puts up multiple layers of obfuscation to run\nthese C&C servers in extremely targeted malware campaigns against organizations in the Middle East, the U.S., and Asia.\n\nWe believe these botnets, each comprising a small group of up to a dozen infected computers, are used to gain persistence\nwithin the networks of select targets. The malware is rather basic, and has limited capabilities that include downloading and\nrunning additional malware. Among active infections in 2019 are two separate locations of a private American company that\noffers services related to national security, victims connecting from a university and a college in the U.S., a victim most likely\nrelated to the U.S. military, and several victims in the Middle East and Asia.\n\nAPT33 has also been executing more aggressive attacks over the past few years. For example, for at least two years the group\nused the private website of a high-ranking European politician (a member of her country’s defense committee) to send spear\nphishing emails to companies that are part of the supply chain of oil products. Targets included a water facility that is used by\nthe U.S. army for the potable water supply of one of its military bases.\n\nThese attacks have likely resulted in concrete infections in the oil industry. For example, in the fall of 2018, we observed\ncommunications between a U.K.-based oil company with computer servers in the U.K. and India and an APT33 C&C server.\nAnother European oil company suffered from an APT33 related malware infection on one of their servers in India for at least 3\nweeks in November and December 2018. There were several other companies in oil supply chains that had been compromised\nin the fall of 2018 as well. These compromises indicate a big risk to companies in the oil industry, as APT33 is known to use\ndestructive malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Date** **From Address** **Subject**\n\n12/31/16 recruitment@alsalam.aero Job Opportunity\n\n4/17/17 recruitment@alsalam.aero Vacancy Announcement\n\n7/17/17 careers@ngaaksa.com Job Openning\n\n9/11/17 jobs@ngaaksa.ga Job Opportunity\n\n11/20/17 jobs@dyn-intl.ga Job Openning\n\n11/28/17 jobs@dyn-intl.ga Job Openning\n\n3/5/18 jobs@mail.dyn-corp.ga Job Openning\n\n7/2/18 careers@sipchem.ga Job Opportunity SIPCHEM\n\n7/30/18 jobs@sipchem.ga Job Openning\n\n8/14/18 jobs@sipchem.ga Job Openning\n\n8/26/18 careers@aramcojobs.ga Latest Vacancy\n\n8/28/18 careers@aramcojobs.ga Latest Vacancy\n\n9/25/18 careers@aramcojobs.ga AramCo Jobs\n\n10/22/18 jobs@samref.ga Job Openning at SAMREF\n\nTable 1. Spear phishing campaigns of APT33. Source: Trend Micro’s Smart Protection Network\n\nThe first two email addresses in the table above (ending in .com and .aero) are being spoofed by the threat group. However, the\naddresses ending in .ga are from the attacker's own infrastructure. The addresses are all impersonating known aviation and oil\nand gas companies.\n\nAside from the relatively noisy attacks of APT33 against oil product supply chains, we found that APT33 has been using several\nC&C domains for small botnets comprised of about a dozen bots each.\n\nIt appears that APT33 took special care to make tracking more difficult. The C&C domains are usually hosted on cloud hosted\nproxies. These proxies relay URL requests from the infected bots to backends at shared webservers that may host thousands\nof legitimate domains. The backends report bot data back to a data aggregator and bot control server that is on a dedicated IP\naddress. The APT33 actors connect to these aggregators via a private VPN network with exit nodes that are changed\nfrequently. The APT33 actors then issue commands to the bots and collect data from the bots using these VPN connections.\n\nIn the fall of 2019 we counted 10 live bot data aggregating and bot controlling servers and tracked a couple of them for months.\nThese aggregators get data from very few C&C servers (only 1 or 2), with only up to a dozen victims per unique C&C domain.\nThe table below lists some of the older C&C domains that are still live today.\n\n**Domain** **Created**\n\noorgans.com 5/28/16\n\nsuncocity.com 5/31/16\n\nzandelshop.com 6/1/16\n\nsimsoshop.com 6/2/16\n\nzeverco.com 6/5/16\n\nqualitweb.com 6/6/16\n\nservice-explorer.com 3/3/17\n\nservice-norton.com 3/6/17\n\n\n-----\n\nservice-eset.com 3/6/17\n\nservice-essential.com 3/7/17\n\nupdate-symantec.com 3/12/17\n\nTable 2. APT33 C&C domains for extreme narrow targeting\n\n[Figure. 1](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/11/APT33-Infection-Chain-1-01.jpg)\n\nFigure 1. Schema showing the multiple obfuscation layers that APT33 uses\n\nThreat actors often use commercial VPN services to hide their whereabouts when administering C&C servers and doing\nreconnaissance. But besides using VPN services that are available for any user, we also regularly see actors using private VPN\nnetworks that they set up for themselves.\n\nSetting up a private VPN can be easily done by renting a couple of servers from datacenters around the world and using open\nsource software like OpenVPN. Though the connections from private VPN networks still come from seemingly unrelated IP\naddresses around the world, this kind of traffic is actually easier to track. Once we know that an exit node is mainly being used\nby a particular actor, we can have a high degree of confidence about the attribution of the connections that are made from the\nIP addresses of the exit node. For example, besides administering C&C servers from a private VPN exit node, an actor might\nalso be doing reconnaissance of targets’ networks.\n\nAPT33 likely uses its VPN exit nodes exclusively. We have been tracking some of the group’s private VPN exit nodes for more\nthan a year and we have listed known associated IP addresses in the table below. The indicated timeframes are conservative; it\nis likely that the IP addresses have been used for a longer time.\n\n**IP address** **First seen** **Last seen**\n\n5.135.120.57 12/4/18 1/24/19\n\n5.135.199.25 3/3/19 3/3/19\n\n31.7.62.48 9/26/18 9/29/18\n\n51.77.11.46 7/1/19 7/2/19\n\n54.36.73.108 7/22/19 10/05/19\n\n54.37.48.172 10/22/19 11/05/19\n\n54.38.124.150 10/28/18 11/17/18\n\n88.150.221.107 9/26/19 11/07/19\n\n91.134.203.59 9/26/18 12/4/18\n\n109.169.89.103 12/2/18 12/14/18\n\n109.200.24.114 11/19/18 12/25/18\n\n137.74.80.220 9/29/18 10/23/18\n\n137.74.157.84 12/18/18 10/21/19\n\n185.122.56.232 9/29/18 11/4/18\n\n185.125.204.57 10/25/18 1/14/19\n\n185.175.138.173 1/19/19 1/22/19\n\n188.165.119.138 10/8/18 11/19/18\n\n193.70.71.112 3/7/19 3/17/19\n\n195.154.41.72 1/13/19 1/20/19\n\n\n-----\n\n213.32.113.159 6/30/19 9/16/19\n\n216.244.93.137 12/10/18 12/21/18\n\nTable 3. IP addresses associated with a few private VPN exit nodes connected to APT33\n\nIt appears that these private VPN exit nodes are also used for reconnaissance of networks that are relevant to the supply chain\nof the oil industry. More concretely, we have witnessed some of the IP addresses in Table 3 doing reconnaissance on the\nnetwork of an oil exploration company and military hospitals in the Middle East, as well as an oil company in the U.S..\n\n[Figure. 2](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/11/APT33-Infection-Chain-2-01.jpg)\n\nFigure 2. APT33’s usage of a private VPN network\n\nAPT33 used its private VPN network to access websites of penetration testing companies, webmail, websites on vulnerabilities,\nand websites related to cryptocurrencies, as well as to read hacker blogs and forums. APT33 also has a clear interest in\nwebsites that specialize in the recruitment of employees in the oil and gas industry. We recommend companies in the oil and\ngas industry to cross-relate their security log files with the IP addresses listed above.\n\n**Security recommendations**\n\n[The continued modernization of facilities for oil, gas, water, and power is making it more difficult to secure them.

Here are some of the best\npractices that these organizations can adopt:\n\nEstablish a regular patching and update policy for all systems. Download patches as soon as possible to prevent\ncybercriminals from exploiting these security flaws.\nImprove employee awareness on the latest attack techniques that cybercriminals use.\nIT administrators should apply the principle of least privilege to make monitoring of inbound and outbound traffic easier.\nInstall a [multilayered protection system that can detect and block malicious intrusions from the gateway to the endpoint.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/all-solutions.html)\n\nSecuring supply chains to these complex and often multinational systems is also difficult, as they usually have necessary thirdparty suppliers that are embedded in their core operations. These parties may be overlooked in terms of security, and\n[vulnerabilities in the communication or connections with them are often targeted by cybercriminals.
