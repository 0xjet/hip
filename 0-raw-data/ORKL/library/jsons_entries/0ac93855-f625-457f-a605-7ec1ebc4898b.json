The landing page appeared to\nbe in the compromised site itself and was not loaded from an iframe, etc. The site just\ndisplayed jibberish (Lorem Ipsum). The EK used three Flash files, attempted a Silverlight\nexploit and triggered several interesting ET signatures. There was also almost no obfuscation\nof the code as well.\n\n[The payload was Tofsee and a thanks goes to @Antelox for confirming it. Tofsee is a](https://twitter.com/Antelox)\nspambot known to send spam emails. It has been dropped by Rig EK in the past. I did not\nsee much email traffic however I was using a proxy which may have caused some traffic to\nnot be logged.\n\nAnyway this is a great find and I hope you can gain a lot of information from it.\n\n## Background Information:\n\nA few articles and samples on Terror exploit kit:\n\nhttps://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Terror-Exploit-Kit–More-like-ErrorExploit-Kit/\n\nhttp://www.broadanalysis.com/2016/06/13/rig-exploit-kit-from-5-200-55-156-sends-tofseespambot/\n\nArticle on Tofsee:\n\n[https://www.cert.pl/en/news/single/tofsee-en/](https://www.cert.pl/en/news/single/tofsee-en/)\n\n## Downloads\n\n[230317TerrorTofsee-> Contains pcapng, payloads and flash files in password protected](https://zerophagemalware.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/230317terrortofsee.zip)\nzip.\n\n## Notable Details:\n\n52.29.235.194 – eu4.echo-ice.com- Part of a malvertising chain\n173.208.245.114 – paydayloanservice.net – Part of a malvertising chain\n128.199.233.119 – Terror EK Traffic\n\n\n-----\n\n103.48.6.14– Tofsee Post Infection\n111.121.193.242 – Tofsee Post Infection\nPayload was Tofsee Spambot (rad6AC11.tmp.exe created kxuepssx.exe)\n\n## Details of infection chain:\n\n(click to enlarge!)\n\nTerror EK via malvertising drops Tofsee spambot.
