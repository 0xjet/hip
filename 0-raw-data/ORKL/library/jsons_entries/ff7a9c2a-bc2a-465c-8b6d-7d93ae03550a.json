In this article, we discuss\nimprovements made to the LODEINFO backdoor shellcode in 2022.\n\nKaspersky investigated new versions of LODEINFO shellcode, namely v0.5.9, v0.6.2, v0.6.3\nand v0.6.5, in March, April and June, respectively. The following chart shows the evolution\ntimeline of this malware since its discovery.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Timeline of LODEINFO releases_**\n\n## LODEINFO v0.5.6: multiple encryption for C2 communication with ancient crypto algorithm\n\nThis LODEINFO v0.5.6 shellcode extracted from a loader module demonstrates several\nenhanced evasion techniques for certain security products, as well as three new backdoor\ncommands implemented by the developer.\n\nAfter infecting the target machine, the LODEINFO backdoor beacons out machine\ninformation to the C2, such as current time, ANSI code page (ACP) identifier, MAC address\nand hostname. The beacon also contains a hardcoded key (NV4HDOeOVyL) used later by\n[the age-old Vigenere cipher. Furthermore, randomly generated junk data is appended to the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)\nend of the data, possibly to evade beaconing detection based on packet size.\n\n**_Vigenere cipher key and randomly generated junk data added in LODEINFO v0.5.6_**\n\nIn December 2021, we discovered LODEINFO v0.5.8, with a slight modification that added\nthe LODEINFO implant version number right after the Vigenere cipher key.\n\nThe encryption function used to send data was also modified, making it even more\ncomplicated. As observed in previous variants, it takes the first 48 bytes of the SHA512 hash\nvalue of the data to be sent. Then it XORs the data using a four-byte XOR key that is equal\n\n\n-----\n\nto the elapsed running time, and prepends it before the data. The first 16 bytes to be sent are\nfrom another SHA512 hash value, this time taken from the previously mentioned hardcoded\nAES key (NV4HDOeOVyL). It encrypts 11 bytes at the end of a base64-encoded payload\n(with replaced padding from “=” to “.”) to dynamically generate the second Vigenere cipher\nkey and the variable of the final generated data. The second key is used by the Vigenere\ncipher to encrypt the base64 encoded header (url-safe replaced padding from “=” to “.”).\n\n**_Crypto algorithms and data flow in C2 communications_**\n\nFinally, the data to be sent to the C2 is produced using the second key, the encrypted\nheader, and the payload through the complex steps described above. The final data packet\nstructure is as follows:\n\n**Offset** **Description** **Crypto**\n**algorithm**\n\n0x00 11 bytes from the end of the payload Vigenere\ncipher\n\n0x0C A delimiter N/A\n\n\n-----\n\n0x0D Message header\n\n**Offset** **Description**\n\n0x00 The first 16 bytes of SHA512 value calculated from the\nhardcoded AES key.\n\n0x10 Size of base64 encoded payload\n\n0x15 A byte of unknown data\n\n0x29 Message payload:\n\n**Offset** **Description**\n\n0x00 XORed the first 48 bytes of SHA512 value calculated\nfrom the following AES encrypted data (offset 0x36), the\nXOR key equals the elapsed running time.\n\n0x30 XORed size of encrypted data\n\n0x35 1 byte XOR key for size of encrypted data (offset 0x30)\n\n0x36 Encrypted data by AES CBC mode with the hardcoded\nAES key “88 8C A3 F2 87 36 CC 12 A5 90 18 56 13 B7\nC0 A7 E1 07 D4 5C 7D 47 37 AD AB A3 8C C2 12 E3 03\nAC” and IV “83 01 36 C9 3A 2D 13 29 23 56 78 A1 F1 0C\nD1 75”. The data contains elapsed running time, current\ntime, ANSII Code Page, MAC address, host name, etc.\n\n\nbase64\n(url-safe\nand\nreplaced\npadding\nfrom “=”\nto “.”)\nVigenere\ncipher\n\nbase64\n(url-safe\nwith\nreplaced\npadding\nfrom “=”\nto “.”)\n\n\n## LODEINFO v0.5.6: 2-byte XOR obfuscation for backdoor command identifiers\n\nThis update included revised crypto algorithms and backdoor command identifiers that were\ndefined as four-byte hardcoded values in previous LODEINFO shellcodes. LODEINFO\nv0.5.6 backdoor command identifiers are obfuscated with a two-byte XOR operation. Before\ncomparing a command identifier, an XOR operation is applied for each command. The\nhardcoded XOR key differs for each command as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Two-byte XOR for four-byte stack strings of backdoor command identifiers_**\n\nWe also observed the actor implementing new backdoor commands such as “comc”,\n“autorun”, and “config” in LODEINFO v0.5.6 and later versions. Twenty-one backdoor\ncommands, including three new commands, are embedded in the LODEINFO backdoor to\ncontrol the victim host.\n\n## LODEINFO v0.5.9: hashing algorithm to get API functions\n\nVersion 0.5.9 has a new hash calculation algorithm compared to v0.5.8. The hashing\nalgorithm is used by the malware to calculate hashes for API function names, to resolve the\nfunction addresses. In this case it seems to be a custom algorithm developed by the actor.\nThe logic of the hash calculation has an XOR operation with a two-byte key at the end and\nthe hardcoded XOR key, which is different in each sample.\n\n**_Changed hash calculation algorithm and additional two-byte XOR key in v0.5.9_**\n\nThis modification suggests the attacker’s goal was to evade signature-based detections and\nmake the reverse engineering process more difficult for security researchers.\n\n\n-----\n\n## LODEINFO v0.6.2: evasion of en_US environment\n\nIn LODEINFO v0.6.2 and later versions, the shellcode has a new feature that looks for the\n“en_US” locale on the victim’s machine in a recursive function and halts execution if that\nlocale is found.\n\n**_Recursive call if the “en-US” locale is found_**\n\nAccording to our own investigations, as well as open-source intelligence collected on this\nmalware, the main targets of these attacks are Japanese entities. The aim of this feature,\ntherefore, is to evade execution in sandboxes and on researcher machines, something that\noccurs most commonly in an English-language locale.\n\n## LODEINFO v0.6.2: generating user agent for C2 communications\n\n\n-----\n\nThe function responsible for generating the user agent for C2 communication has also been\nupdated from v0.6.2. The malware generates the user agent string using the following\nhardcoded formatted string, where the %s is substituted with the version number of the\ninstalled chrome.exe application:\n\n“Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)\nChrome/%s Safari/537.36″.\n\nThe malware gets the version number of the installed chrome.exe from the EXE file present\nat one of the following file paths:\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\nC:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\nC:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\n\nOtherwise, if none of these files exists on the system, the malware uses the hardcoded\nversion 98.0.4758.102 to create the following user agent string:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)\nChrome/98.0.4758.102 Safari/537.36\n\n## LODEINFO v0.6.2: supporting the injection of the 64-bit shellcode in ‘memory’ command\n\nBased on our deep analysis of this version, we discovered a very interesting update in the\nshellcode loading scheme implemented from version v0.6.2, in the function that handles the\n‘memory’ command.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Checking the OS architecture and the next shellcode architecture_**\n\nDuring the memory injection process, performed using the function responsible for the\nmemory command, the malware checks the first byte of the second stage shellcode to\ndetermine the shellcode architecture using a magic hex value. If the first byte is 0xE9, the\narchitecture is 32-bit, and if it is 0x8D, the architecture is 64-bit. After the check is completed,\nif the first byte was 0x8D, it gets replaced with 0xE9 in order for the shellcode to execute\nproperly. In the function shown below, the malware checks the OS architecture of the\ninfected machine and handles the appropriate loading scheme according to OS architecture\nand shellcode architecture.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Memory injection of the 64-bit shellcode was supported in v0.6.2_**\n\nIn the shellcode injection process, it uses the basic Windows APIs such as VirtualAllocEx(),\nWriteProcessMemory() and CreateRemoteThread() for memory injection of the 32-bit\nshellcode and NtAllocateVirtualMemory(), NtWriteVirtualMemory() and\nRtlCreateUserThread() for supporting the memory injection of the 64-bit shellcode.\n\n## LODEINFO v0.6.3: reducing backdoor commands\n\nAs for updates implemented in the LODEINFO backdoor commands, the obfuscation method\nusing two-byte XOR encryption for backdoor command identifiers as well as the debug\nstrings remained untouched up to version 0.5.6. However, in version 0.6.3, the actor\nremoved some of the unnecessary backdoor commands to improve the efficiency of the\nbackdoor. The number of backdoor commands was reduced from 21 in v0.6.2 to 11 in v0.6.3.\nThe modifications to the C2 command list are shown in the table below.\n\n\n**Command** **Description and updates** **Implemented**\n**since**\n**version**\n\n\n**Presence**\n**of**\n**commands**\n**in v0.6.3 –**\n**v0.6.5**\n\n\ncommand Show embedded backdoor command list. v0.1.2 Available\n\nsend Download a file from C2. v0.1.2 Available\n\nrecv Upload a file to C2. v0.1.2 Available\n\n\nmemory Inject the shellcode in memory.

At the time of writing this report, in September 2022, we detected v0.6.6 and\nv0.6.7 with new TTPs.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the core modifications of the LODEINFO shellcode was support for Intel 64-bit\narchitecture, to expand the targeted victim environments. The updated TTPs and\nimprovements in LODEINFO and related malware, such as the implementation of the\nVigenere cipher, complex infection flow with fileless malware, partial XOR encryption, C2\ncommunication packets with a unique data structure and variable length, and passwordprotected documents, indicate that the attacker is particularly focused on making detection,\nanalysis and investigation harder for security researchers.\n\nFor this reason, it becomes more and more difficult to keep track of this actor. That is why we\nbelieve it is important to emphasize collaboration within the security research community, to\nshare our results and findings about LODEINFO and related malware attacks.\n\n##
