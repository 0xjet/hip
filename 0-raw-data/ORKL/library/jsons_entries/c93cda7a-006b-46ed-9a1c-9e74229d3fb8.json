    "plain_text": "# North Korean hackers are skimming US and European shoppers\n\n\n##### 6th July 2020 / Web Skimming / Sansec Threat Research Team\n\n**North Korean state sponsored hackers are implicated in the interception of online payments from**\n\n**American and European shoppers, Sansec research shows. Hackers associated with the APT**\n\n**Lazarus/HIDDEN COBRA[1] group were found to be breaking into online stores of large US retailers and**\n\n**planting payment skimmers as early as May 2019.**\n\nPreviously, North Korean hacking activity was mostly restricted to banks and South Korean crypto markets[2],\n\ncovert cyber operations that earned hackers $2 billion, according to a 2019 United Nations report[3]. As Sansec’s\n\nnew research shows, they have now extended their portfolio with the profitable crime of digital skimming.\n\nSansec researchers have attributed the activity to HIDDEN COBRA because infrastructure from previous\n\noperations was reused. Furthermore, distinctive patterns in the malware code were identified that linked\n\nl l h k h\n\n\n-----\n\n## HIDDEN COBRA & digital skimming\n\n\n## HIDDEN COBRA & digital skimming\n\n\nDigital skimming, also known as Magecart[4], is the interception of credit cards during online store purchases.\n\nThis type of fraud has been growing since 2015 and was traditionally dominated by Russian-[5] and Indonesian\nspeaking[6] hacker groups. This is no longer the case, as the incumbent criminals now face competition from\n\ntheir North Korean counterparts.\n\nIn order to intercept transactions, an attacker needs to modify the computer code that runs an online store.\n\nHIDDEN COBRA managed to gain access to the store code of large retailers such as international fashion chain\n\nClaire’s[7]. How HIDDEN COBRA got access is yet unknown, but attackers often use spearphishing attacks\n\n(booby-trapped emails) to obtain the passwords of retail staff.\n\nUsing the unauthorized access, HIDDEN COBRA injects its malicious script into the store checkout page. The\n\nskimmer waits for keystrokes of unsuspecting customers. Once a customer completes the transaction, the\n\nintercepted data - such as credit card numbers - are sent to a HIDDEN COBRA-controlled collection server.\n\n## Italian model agency as money mule\n\nCuriously, HIDDEN COBRA used the sites of an Italian modeling agency and a vintage music store from Tehran\n\nto run its global skimming campaign.\n\nTo monetize the skimming operations, HIDDEN COBRA developed a global exfiltration network. This network\n\nutilizes legitimate sites, that got hijacked and repurposed to serve as disguise for the criminal activity. The\n\nnetwork is also used to funnel the stolen assets so they can be sold on dark web markets. Sansec has identified\n\na number of these exfiltration nodes, which include a modeling agency[8] from Milan, a vintage music store[9]\n\nfrom Tehran and a family run book store[10] from New Jersey.\n\n## Technical analysis\n\nSansec monitors millions of online stores for skimming activity and typically finds 30 to 100 infected stores per\n\nday. Many cases have a common modus operandi, such as shared infrastructure or striking features in\n\nprogramming style. These traits can be obvious, such as the debug message “Success bro” that led to the\n\narrest of three Indonesians in December[6]. However, sometimes they are more subtle, as is the case with\n\nHIDDEN COBRA.\n\nh h d f d l l d d l k b k d l\n\n\n-----\n\ng q y y g\n\n\noperandi (or TTP), which will be discussed next.\n\n\n##### The first campaign: clienToken=\n\n```\n<script src=\"https://www.luxmodelagency.com/wp-includes/js/customize-gtag.min.js\"></script>\n\n```\n\nOn June 23rd, 2019, Sansec discovered a skimmer on a US truck parts store that uses a compromised Italian\n\nmodeling site[11] to harvest payment data. The injected script `customize-gtag.min.js` [12] is scrambled with a\n\npopular Javascript obfuscator[13]. Hidden in the code, the string `WTJ4cFpXNTBWRzlyWlc0OQ== is found, which is`\n\nthe double-base64 encoded representation of `clientToken= . This particular keyword is later used as HTTP`\n\nGET parameter to send the stolen payload to the collector exfiltration node. The specific encoding and the\n\nattempt to disguise the stolen payload as “clientToken” form a uniquely identifying characteristic.\n\nThe malware was removed within 24 hours but a week later, the very same malware resurfaced on the same\n\nstore. This time, it used a New Jersey book store to harvest credit cards[14]:\n\n```\n<script src=\"https://www.signedbooksandcollectibles.com/js/gmaps.min.js\"></script>\n\n```\n\nDuring the following months, Sansec discovered the same malware on several dozen stores. Each time, it uses\n\none of these hijacked sites as loader and card collector:\n\n```\nstefanoturco.com (between 2019-07-19 and 2019-08-10)\ntechnokain.com (between 2019-07-06 and 2019-07-09)\ndarvishkhan.net (between 2019-05-30 and 2019-11-26)\nareac-agr.com (between 2019-05-30 and 2020-05-01)\nluxmodelagency.com (between 2019-06-23 and 2020-04-07)\nsignedbooksandcollectibles.com (between 2019-07-01 and 2020-05-24)\n\n```\n\n##### The second campaign: __preloader\n\nIn February and March 2020, several domain names were registrered that closely resemble popular consumer\n\nbrands:\n\n```\n2020-02-10 PAPERS0URCE.COM\n2020-02-26 FOCUSCAMERE.COM \n2020-03-21 CLAIRES-ASSETS.COM \n\n```\n\nb l f d h b f h h d b d d h\n\n\n-----\n\nparticularly odd code snippet, that Sansec has not observed anywhere else. The three relevant malware\n\nsegments are displayed below for reference. Common behavior: upon form submission a hidden, dynamic\n\nimage is added to the page with the deceptive name `__preloader . The image address is controlled by the`\n\nattacker, and the intercepted and encoded payload is sent as argument to this image, along with several random\n\nnumbers. Immediately, the dynamic image is removed from the page, so the theft is invisible to the customer.\n\nSansec has previously discussed this exfiltration method when it first reported on the Claire’s hack on June\n\n15th[7].\n\n_(code slightly modified for readability)_\n\nThe common code, behavior, registrar and DNS server are unique traits that link these cases to the same\n\nsource.\n\n## The North Korean link\n\nAs the diagram above shows, Sansec has established multiple, independent links to previously documented\n\nNorth Korean hacking activity. We will discuss each link separately.\n\n##### technokain.com\n\nSouth Korea based EST Security has published two articles[16] [17] documenting a North Korea-attributed attack\n\nwhere a malicious loader is embedded in Korean office documents. The loader installs remote access software\n\nfor Windows on the victim’s computer, which is downloaded from this address:\n\n\nThe three malware cases not only share infrastructure (domain registrar & DNS service), but they also share a\n\nparticularly odd code snippet, that Sansec has not observed anywhere else. The three relevant malware\n\n```\n2019-07-12 https://technokain.com/ads/adshow1.dat\n\n```\n\nAdditionally, US-based security firm Rewterz reported a spearphishing attack targeting attendees of the annual\n\nConsumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas[18]. This attack uses malware from the same address.\n\nThese attacks took place on July 11 and 12th, less than a week after the placement of a skimmer on the same\n\nsite:\n\n```\n2019-07-06 https://technokain.com/vendor/jquery.validate.min.js\n\n```\n\n##### darvishkhan.net\n\n\n19 20\n\n\n-----\n\ng,\n\n```\n2019-06-27 https://darvishkhan.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/update6.dat \n\n```\n\nTwo weeks earlier, multiple digital skimmers were launched from the same site, harvesting credit cards from\n\nseveral US, UK and Australia-based stores:\n\n```\n2019-06-12 https://darvishkhan.net/wp-includes/js/hotjar.min.js\n2019-06-14 https://darvishkhan.net/wp-includes/js/dist/gtm.min.js\n\n```\n\n##### areac-agr.com\n\nOn October 25, Beijing-based Netlab360 discovered a novel remote access trojan (RAT) that showed multiple\n\nsimilarities with previously DPRK attributed malware[21]. Components of the tool were loaded from\n\n```\n2019-10-25 http://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/check.vm\n\n```\n\nBefore and after the presence of this malware, digital skimmers were hosted on the same site, that would\n\nintercept payments from multiple American stores:\n\n```\n2019-08-16 https://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-includes/Requests/Security1.3.min.js\n2020-05-01 https://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-includes/Requests/Utility/json.min.js\n\n```\n\n##### papers0urce.com\n\nThe three malware domains from the `__preloader campaign use distinct IPs. One of them -` `papers0urce.com`\n\n- uses an address from Dutch ISP Leaseweb, `23.81.246.179 . This IP is not known to have been used for other`\n\ndomain names since 2015[22], however, it is featured in the same North Korea research as the previously\n\ndiscussed `areac-agr.com` [21]. The IP is hardcoded in the RAT, and used as a command and control (C2) server.\n\n##### Discussion\n\nDoes the usage of common loader sites, and the similarity in time frame, prove that the DPRK-attributed\n\noperations are run by the same actor as the skimming operations? Theoretically, it is possible that different\n\nnefarious actors had simultaneous control over the same set of hijacked sites, but in practice, this would be\n\nextremely unlikely. First, thousands of sites get hacked each day[23], making an overlap highly coincidental.\n\nSecondly, when a site gets hacked, it is common practice for a perpetrator to close the exploited vulnerability\n\nafter gaining access, in order to shield the new asset from competitors.\n\n## C l i\n\n\n-----\n\nactors have engaged in large scale digital skimming activity since at least May 2019.\n\n## References\n\n[1. https://www.us-cert.gov/hiddencobra](https://www.us-cert.gov/hiddencobra) ↩\n\n[2. https://www.cyberscoop.com/north-korea-sanctions-lazarus-group-treasury-department/](https://www.cyberscoop.com/north-korea-sanctions-lazarus-group-treasury-department/) ↩\n\n3. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-cyber-un/north-korea-took-2-billion-in-cyberattacks-to-fund\nweapons-program-u-n-report-idUSKCN1UV1ZX ↩\n\n[4. https://sansec.io/what-is-magecart](https://sansec.io/what-is-magecart) ↩\n\n[5. https://sansec.io/research/magento-bruteforce-dashboard](https://sansec.io/research/magento-bruteforce-dashboard) ↩\n\n[6. https://sansec.io/research/magecart-hackers-arrested](https://sansec.io/research/magecart-hackers-arrested) ↩ ↩[2]\n\n[7. https://sansec.io/research/magecart-corona-lockdown](https://sansec.io/research/magecart-corona-lockdown) ↩ ↩[2]\n\n[8. http://luxmodelagency.com/](http://luxmodelagency.com/) ↩\n\n[9. https://www.darvishkhan.net/](https://www.darvishkhan.net/) ↩\n\n[10. https://www.signedbooksandcollectibles.com/](https://www.signedbooksandcollectibles.com/) ↩\n\n[11. https://urlscan.io/result/e84b5381-4c24-4bff-b2f3-c600a07538d1/#transactions](https://urlscan.io/result/e84b5381-4c24-4bff-b2f3-c600a07538d1/#transactions) ↩\n\n[12. https://urlscan.io/responses/9fe97ae18c45e22fe76b8bd5165d0e152bec464d92ef5f7319b1723aba1c0edb/](https://urlscan.io/responses/9fe97ae18c45e22fe76b8bd5165d0e152bec464d92ef5f7319b1723aba1c0edb/) ↩\n\n[13. https://obfuscator.io/](https://obfuscator.io/) ↩\n\n[14. https://urlscan.io/result/18e3546d-8da0-49ac-9484-450a8ed90cd5/#transactions](https://urlscan.io/result/18e3546d-8da0-49ac-9484-450a8ed90cd5/#transactions) ↩\n\n[15. https://urlscan.io/result/f2052c0e-7df1-4b3a-b008-35476683a82f/#transactions](https://urlscan.io/result/f2052c0e-7df1-4b3a-b008-35476683a82f/#transactions) ↩\n\n[16. https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2416](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2416) ↩\n\n[17. https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2418](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2418) ↩\n\n[18. https://www.rewterz.com/rewterz-news/rewterz-threat-alert-ces-themed-targeting-from-lazarus](https://www.rewterz.com/rewterz-news/rewterz-threat-alert-ces-themed-targeting-from-lazarus) ↩\n\n19. https://fortiguard.com/resources/threat-brief/2019/08/09/fortiguard-threat-intelligence-brief-august-09\n2019 ↩\n\n[20. https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2397](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2397) ↩\n\n[21. https://blog.netlab.360.com/dacls-the-dual-platform-rat-en/](https://blog.netlab.360.com/dacls-the-dual-platform-rat-en/) ↩ ↩[2]\n\n[22. https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/23.81.246.179/relations](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/23.81.246.179/relations) ↩\n\n23. https://www.forbes.com/sites/jameslyne/2013/09/06/30000-web-sites-hacked-a-day-how-do-you-host\nyours/#135be6dd1738 ↩\n\n\ndocumented, North Korea attributed hacking operations.
