On December 25, software engineer Darren Cauthon tweeted an image](https://twitter.com/darrencauthon/status/813096722989809665?lang=en)\n[showing his family's LG smart TV had been infected with ransomware. The smart TV was](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/ransomware)\ndisabled, and displayed a ransom note mimicking a notification from the FBI demanding a\npayment of US$500. It’s worth noting that the LG TV was an older model running Google TV,\na platform that was abandoned in 2014.\n\nCauthon asked LG to help him restore the TV to its factory settings. At first the company told\nhim to bring it to a support center but eventually relented and gave him instructions for a\nfactory reset. The Christmas story had an eventual happy ending—the factory reset worked\n[and Cauthon posted a video of the process to help other smart TV owners who might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WZ4uLFTHEE)\nencounter the same problem.\n\nIn this particular case, the ransomware that infected the smart TV was identified as the\nAndroid mobile ransomware FLocker. First discovered in May 2015, the notorious mobile\nransomware has since been rewritten thousands of times to evade detection. The Cauthon\nincident follows the pattern of recent variants of FLocker (detected as\n[ANDROIDOS_FLOCKER.A): the ransomware impersonates law enforcement agencies,](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/androidos_flocker.a)\naccuses the victim of crimes they didn’t commit and then demands a ransom. In June of\n[2016, Trend Micro already recognized that it was capable of infecting smart TVs. We also](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/flocker-ransomware-crosses-smart-tv/)\nnoted that it is not the first ransomware to target TVs; and with the proliferation of smart\ndevices across the world, it won’t be the last. Users should take steps to secure their smart\ndevices and be wary about the apps they download and install.\n\nHere are some other notable ransomware stories from the last two weeks of December:\n\n**KillDisk**\n\n\n-----\n\n[KillDisk is a malware well-known for being used in cyber-espionage and sabotage operations](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/archive/malware/killdisk.e)\nthat hit [several companies in the utilities sector. The most well-known case was when it was](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/killdisk-and-blackenergy-are-not-just-energy-sector-threats/)\nused in the [BlackEnergy attacks that victimized](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/faq-blackenergy) [Ukrainian energy companies in late](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/first-malware-driven-power-outage-reported-in-ukraine)\nDecember 2015.\n\nIn mid-December of 2016, KillDisk was reportedly deployed in an operation hitting Ukrainian\nbanks. According to [reports, after the TeleBot backdoor Trojan was installed, KillDisk deleted,](http://news.softpedia.com/news/blackenergy-hackers-now-launching-attacks-against-ukrainian-banks-511003.shtml)\nreplaced, or rewrote crucial files to render computers unbootable and cover up illicit\noperations. The malware is believed to be developed by the TeleBots group, which created\nthe TeleBot backdoor Trojan.\n\nNow, KillDisk (detected as RANSOM_KILLDISK.A) has been updated with a ransomware\nfeature that encrypts targeted files and appends them with string \"do not touch crypted file.\"\n[After encryption, it locks out the user and displays a simple ransom note. Other reports show](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2016/12/30/killdisk-ransomware-wants-210000/)\nthat the KillDisk ransomware component asks for a huge ransom: 222 Bitcoin, which\namounts to about US$210,000.\n\n_Figure 1.KillDisk sample encrypted file_\n\n_Figure 2. KillDisk ransom note_\nWe have identified that KillDisk fulfills a certain purpose for cybercriminals, the ‘clean up’\nafter a Trojan installation to hide traces of the infection. This new ransomware update adds\nanother layer to that—if the victim is preoccupied by the ransomware, he or she might not\n\n\n-----\n\nlook for another type of malware infection.Koovla\n\nKoovla (detected as RANSOM_EDA2RUNSOME.B) is a new and unusual ransomware\nvariant. It calls itself a [Jigsaw “twin”, but doesn’t follow the behavior of the older ransomware.](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/jigsaw-ransomware-plays-games-victims/)\nAfter it encrypting targeted files, Koovla offers a free decryption key if the victim reads two\n[security articles, one about safe browsing and the other about the Jigsaw ransomware. The](https://security.googleblog.com/2010/09/stay-safe-while-browsing.html)\nmotive behind this tactic is unclear, but if the aim of the ransomware operators is to raise\n[awareness then they follow the footsteps of other “educational” families such as EduCrypt](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/educrypt-ransomware-that-teaches-victims-lesson-about-internet-safety-1568106)\n[and Shinolocker.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/ransom_shinolock.a)\n\nIn their ransom note, the ransomware operators say that if the victim is too “lazy” to read the\narticles, their files will be deleted. It doesn’t seem ready for distribution though, as the sample\nobtained will actually terminate if the button of its message window is clicked.\n\nThe complete text of the ransom note reads:\n\n_\"Hello, I'm nice Jigsaw or more commonly known as Jigsaws twin._\n\n_Unfortunately all of your personal files (pictures, documents, etc...) have beenencrypted by_\n_me, an evil computer virus know as 'Ransomeware'._\n\n_Now now, not to worry I'm going to let you restore them but only if you agree to stop_\n_downloading\\unsafe applications off the internet._\n\n_If you continue to do so may end up with a virus way worse than me! You might even end up_\n_meetingmy infamous brother Jigsaw :(_\n\n_While you're at it, you can also read the small article below by Google's security team on_\n_how to stay safe online._\n\n_Oh yeah I almost forgot! In order for me to decrypt your files you must read the two articles_\n_below, once you have click the \\\"Get My Decryption Key\\\" button._\n\n_Then enter in your decryption key and click the \\\"Decrypt My Files\\\" button. Eventually all of_\n_your files will be decrypted :)_\n_If the timer reaches zero then all of your personal files will be deleted because you were too_\n_lazy to read two articles.”_\n\n**Adam Locker**\n\n\n-----\n\nAdam Locker (detected as RANSOM_ADAMLOCK.A) encrypts targeted files on a victim s\n[system but offers them a free decryption key which can be accessed through Adf.ly, a URL](https://adf.ly/)\nshortening and advertising service. Victims just need to click on the \"Open\" button on the\nransom note and they are led to adf[.]ly/1h2U8c. The shortened link redirects them to\nhttp://adamlocker[.]000webhostapp[.]com/key.html, a page that shows the decryption key.\n\nThis ransomware veers away from traditional extortion techniques: instead of demanding\nransom from victims directly, it uses them to earn money through Adf.ly’s payment scheme.\nThe company promises that people can “earn money just by posting links”. Adf.ly typically\nshows ads before leading users to their intended link, and the link posters get paid for driving\ntraffic to the ads.\n\nThe company compensates each poster every time their link is clicked —the more views, the\nmore money earned. The ransomware operators are simply driving up their page views and\nmaking money by abusing this legitimate service.\n\n_Figure 3.The_\n\n_AdamLocker ransom note_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4.Adam Locker’s decryption screen_\n\n**DeriaLock**\n\nAnother ransomware family that was spotted during the Christmas holidays was DeriaLock.\nFirst seen on Christmas Eve and updated only a few days after, this particular family asks\nvictims to contact a Skype account for the ransom payment.\n\nThe first variant (detected as RANSOM_DERIALOCK.A) was only a screenlocker. The\nsecond variant (detected as RANSOM_DERIALOCK.B) was updated with an encryption\nroutine and appends .deria to the names of files that it encrypts.\n\nEven after the update, victims are still asked to contact a Skype account for payment\npurposes. The amount demanded is actually US $10 less than the first variant. The updated\nversion also has a progress bar showing the time allotted for paying the ransom: 1 day. If\npayment is not made by that time, it claims that it will delete all private files.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. DeriaLock’s first variant was a simple screenlocker_\n\n_Figure 6. DeriaLock is updated with an encryption routine and new visuals_\n\n**Hidden Tear variants**\n\nTwo new Hidden Tear-based variants were spotted in late December 2016. The first is\nKoKoKrypt (detected as RANSOM_HIDDENTEARKOKO.A), which is a very straightforward\nransomware. It encrypts files and adds the extension .kokolocker. Victims are served a\nransom note demanding .1 Bitcoin, or US$90.\n\nThe second is the Guster ransomware (detected as RANSOM_HIDDENTEARGUSTER.A). It\nuses the extension .locked. This particular ransomware has an animated screenlocker with a\nvoice-over and a 48:00:00 countdown. The ransom is set at .4 Bitcoin, or roughly $365.\n\nThe continuing emergence of Hidden Tear variants shows just how dangerous open source\nransomware is. Opportunistic malware developers will abuse any available resource.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7.The ransom_\n\n_note for Guster_\n\n**_Ransomware solutions:_**\n\nTrend Micro offers different solutions to protect enterprises, small businesses, and home\nusers to help minimize the risk of getting infected by ransomware:\n\nEnterprises can benefit from a multi-layered, step-by-step approach in order to best mitigate\nthe risks brought by these threats.
