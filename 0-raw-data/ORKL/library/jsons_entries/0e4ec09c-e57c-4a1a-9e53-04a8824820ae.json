Part 3.\n\n**[ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/operation-ta505-part3/](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/operation-ta505-part3/)**\n\nPositive Technologies\n\nPublished on 24 May 2020\n\n\n-----\n\nNetwork infrastructure analysis plays an important role in the study of malware distribution campaigns. Data on\nwhich IP addresses corresponded to a given domain name over time facilitate the identification of new malicious\nservers. In turn, retrospectively determining which domains were resolved to a given IP address provides new\ndomains, for which the search procedure can be repeated, leading the process further. This information can be\nimmensely helpful in establishing the geography of nodes, identifying \"favorite\" hosts and registrars, and\ndetermining which values an attacker characteristically enters into fields when registering domains.\n\nMetainformation that appears useless at first glance may very well prove its worth after a period of a days, weeks,\nor months. In the course of malware analysis, sooner or later the question of attribution inevitably arises, and\nindirect identifiers such as network indicators can go a long way in determining which criminal group a certain tool\nbelongs to.\n\nThis article examines the most characteristic network infrastructure indicators of the TA505 group, as well as\nintersections between TA505 and another hacker group, Buhtrap.\n\n## Domain name registrars\n\nIn total, we analyzed 372 domains belonging to TA505 and identified 22 organizations that facilitated the acquisition\nof these domains. The resources most frequently used were the following:\n\nWhoisGuard, Inc. — 28 domain names\nEranet International Limited — 26 domain names\n\n[WhoisGuard, an organization based in Panama, offers the service of concealing domain owners' registration data](http://www.whoisguard.com/)\nfrom public access. This is [not the first time we have seen their services used by hackers to establish anonymity](http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2019/07/ironpython-darkly-how-we-uncovered.html)\nand hinder investigations.\n\nTA505 domains registered\n\nthrough WhoisGuard, sorted by malware family\nTA505 has utilized other, similar services, though to a lesser extent. These include PROTECTSERVICE LTD, Whois\nPrivacy Protection Foundation, and Domains by Proxy LLC.\n\n[Eranet International Limited is one of the largest registrars in Hong Kong. It should be noted that members of TA505](http://www.now.top/)\ntended to use [dynamic DNS when registering domains with this provider. As a result, the IP addresses that their](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS)\ndomain names were resolved to changed frequently, making them difficult to track.\n\n\n-----\n\nTA505 domains\n\nregistered through Eranet International Limited, sorted by malware family\n\n## Domain name registrants\n\nWhile investigating the WHOIS data of various domain names, we were able to obtain unique values for certain\nfields in a number of cases.\n\nWHOIS data for TA505 domain names\n\n**Domain** **WHOIS field** **Value** **Malware**\n\nkentona[.]su Email ctouma2@gmail.com Smoke\nLoader/RMS\nRAT\n\nkoppepan[.]app Email nox1u9bruzgg@contactprivacy.email FlawedAmmyy\nloader\n\n0141koppepan[.]com Email 0141.koppe.pan@gmail.com FlawedAmmyy\nloader\n\nelast[.]pw City hai dian hai dian ServHelper\nRAT\n\nName Lei Sun Lei\n\nPhone +86.15810310076\n\nEmail std3199@163.com\n\nmakosoft[.]hu Email takagimeister@gmail.com EmailStealer\n\nbigpresense[.]top Fax +1.7246992079 EmailStealer\n\nEmail armstrongdom@slimemail.com\n\nsolsin[.]top Organization Brandon P.

There are, however, certain values particularly worth\nnoting.

We\nwill, however, note that hackers often utilize legitimate resources that have been compromised to host the first stage\nof their malware campaigns. The following domains are cases in point:\n\ngreenthumbsup[.]jp\nfakers.co[.]jp\nnanepashemet[.]com\nnagomi-753[.]jp\niluj[.]in\n\n## Autonomous systems (AS)\n\nFor the sake of completeness, here are the top autonomous systems to which the IP addresses of C&C servers\nused by TA505 belong. Of course, a single autonomous system serves many hosts, both legitimate and nonlegitimate, including various malware families of disparate origins. The following statistics should simply be viewed\nas an overview of the attacker's preferences. Taken with other data, they can be used for attribution.\n\nAutonomous systems frequently used by TA505\n\n\n-----\n\n**Autonomous system number (ASN)** **AS name** **Number of IP addresses**\n\n39798 MivoCloud SRL 21\n\n61138 Zappie Host LLC 14\n\n51852 Private Layer INC 8\n\n13335 Cloudflare, Inc. 5\n\n199524 G-Core Labs S.A. 5\n\n21100 ITL LLC 5\n\n45102 Alibaba (US) Technology Co., Ltd. 5\n\n## TA505 and Buhtrap\n\n[On July 11, 2019, specialists from ESET released an article about a recent attack carried out by the Buhtrap group](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/07/11/buhtrap-zero-day-espionage-campaigns/)\nusing a zero-day vulnerability in the Win32k component of Windows. The article described a so-called 'grabber'\nmodule used to harvest user passwords from email clients, browsers, and other sources. Later, we unearthed\nanother similar module (MD5: c6e9d7280f77977a6968722e8124f51c) with the same C&C server in its body\n(redmond.corp-microsoft[.]com).\n\nC&C server in the\n\nBuhtrap grabber module\n[Running a query through the PaSiveTotal resource reveals that this host has been rendered to the IP address](https://community.riskiq.com/search/redmond.corp-microsoft.com)\n95[.]179.159.170 since June 6, 2019.\n\n[Several days earlier, on July 2, 2019, specialists from Proofpoint released a report regarding new tools used by the](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/ta505-begins-summer-campaigns-new-pet-malware-downloader-andromut-uae-south)\n[TA505 group, one of which is called Andromut (also known as Gelup). Andromut is a downloader for the](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/latest-spam-campaigns-from-ta505-now-using-new-malware-tools-gelup-and-flowerpippi/)\nFlawedAmmyy RAT. One of the variations of the downloader that we encountered (MD5:\n0cbeb424d96e5c268ec2525d603f64eb) uses the domain compatexchange-cloudapp[.]net as its C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\nC&C server in Gelup from TA505,\n\nafter decryption\nThe [PaSiveTotal resource shows us that this host has been resolved to the IP address 95[.]179.159.170 since June](https://community.riskiq.com/search/compatexchange-cloudapp.net)\n8, 2019.\n\nThese two domains were registered with the same registrar (Tucows Domains Inc.) within two days of one another,\nand are resolved to the same IP address. Considering that both groups carried out attacks throughout June, it is\nreasonable to conclude that Buhtrap and TA505 used the same host as a C&C server.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the domain compatexchange-cloudapp[.]net was used not only in the downloader earlier\ndiscussed, but also in older versions of Buhtrap components.\n\n\n-----\n\nFirst intersection of TA505 and Buhtrap found in\n\nnetwork infrastructure\nWe later discovered another intersection between the two hacker groups. The domains of TA505's Smoke Loader\nand a second grabber from Buhtrap displayed a similar congruence: the domain test-service012505[.]com from\nSmoke Loader (MD5: 5fc6f24d43bc7ca45a81d159291955d1) and the domain secure-telemetry[.] net from the\ngabber (MD5: 79d1a836423c7ee57b6127cf2930a9d9) have been resolved to the IP address 194[.]4.56.252 since\nJune 17th and 16th, 2019, respectively.\n\n\n-----\n\nSecond intersection of TA505 and Buhtrap found in\n\nnetwork infrastructure\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis article has examined the network infrastructure of the hacker group TA505. Starting with a look at their\npreferred domain name registrars and the hosts of their C&C servers, we unearthed interesting details in the client\ninformation provided by the group during domain registration. This could serve as a starting point for further\ninvestigations. We then discussed intersections that were discovered between the infrastructure of the TA505 and\nBuhtrap hacker groups. The incidence of shared servers between the two groups could have several explanations:\nthe groups could have a bilateral agreement to share the servers, they could be managed and coordinated by a\nsingle entity, or they could both rent the servers from a third party (thereby economizing on expenditures). Our work\ninvestigating these groups will not end here. We will continue to monitor their activity and search for new information\non their possible connections and collaboration.\n\n**Authors: Alexey Vishnyakov and Maxim Anfinogenov, Positive Technologies**\n\n## IOCs\n\nTA505 C2:\n0141koppepan[.]com\nbigpresense[.]top\nelast[.]pw\nfakers.co[.]jp\ngreenthumbsup[.]jp\niluj[.]in\nkentona[.]su\nkoppepan[.]app\nmakosoft[.]hu\nmicrosoftsyncservice[.]biz\nnagomi 753[ ]jp\n\n\n-----\n\nnanepashemet[.]com\nnewfolder2-service[.]space\noffice365onlinehome[.]com\nsolsin[.]top\ntest-service012505[.]com\nwindows-several-update[.]com\nwindows-update-02-en[.]com\nc6e9d7280f77977a6968722e8124f51c — grabber module Buhtrap\nredmond.corp-microsoft[.]com — Grabber C&C\n0cbeb424d96e5c268ec2525d603f64eb — Gelup loader of TA505\ncompatexchange-cloudapp[.]net — Gelup C&C\n95.179.159[.]170 — TA505 and Buhtrap shared host\n79d1a836423c7ee57b6127cf2930a9d9 — grabber module Buhtrap\nsecure-telemetry[.]net — Grabber C&C\n5fc6f24d43bc7ca45a81d159291955d1 — Smoke Loader of TA505\ntest-service012505[.]com — Smoke Loader C&C\n194[.]4.56.252 — TA505 and Buhtrap shared host\n\n\n-----",
