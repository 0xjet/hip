Part 1\n\n**[securelist.com/big-threats-using-code-similarity-part-1/97239/](https://securelist.com/big-threats-using-code-similarity-part-1/97239/)**\n\nAuthors\n\n[Costin Raiu](https://securelist.com/author/costin/)\n\nToday, we are announcing the release of KTAE, the Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine.\nThis code attribution technology, developed initially for internal use by the Kaspersky Global\nResearch and Analysis Team, is now being made available to a wider audience. You can\nread more about KTAE in our [official press release, or go directly to its](https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2020_new-kaspersky-threat-attribution-engine-connects-new-attacks) info page on the\nKaspersky Enterprise site. From an internal tool, to prototype and product, this is a road\nwhich took about 3 years. We tell the story of this trip below, while throwing in a few code\nexamples as well. However, before diving into KTAE, it’s important to talk about how it all\nstarted, on a sunny day, approximately three years ago.\n\nMay 12, 2017, a Friday, started in a very similar fashion to many other Fridays: I woke up,\nmade coffee, showered and drove to work. As I was reading e-mails, one message from a\ncolleague in Spain caught my attention. Its subject said “Crisis … (and more)”. Now, crisis\n\n\n-----\n\n(and more!) is not something that people appreciate on a Friday, and it wasn t April 1st either.\nGoing through the e-mail from my colleague, it became obvious something was going on in\nseveral companies around the world. The e-mail even had an attachment with a photo, which\nis now world famous:\n\nSoon after that, Spain’s Computer Emergency Response Team CCN-CERT, posted an [alert](https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/seguridad-al-dia/comunicados-ccn-cert/4464-ataque-masivo-de-ransomware-que-afecta-a-un-elevado-numero-de-organizaciones-espanolas.html)\non their site about a massive ransomware attack affecting several Spanish organizations.\nThe alert recommended the installation of updates in the Microsoft March 2017 Security\nBulletin as a means of stopping the spread of the attack. Meanwhile, the National Health\n[Service (NHS) in the U.K. also issued an alert and confirmed infections at 16 medical](https://digital.nhs.uk/article/1491/Statement-on-reported-NHS-cyber-attack)\ninstitutions.\n\nAs we dug into the attack, we confirmed additional infections in several additional countries,\nincluding Russia, Ukraine, and India.\n\n[Quite essential in stopping these attacks was the Kaspersky System Watcher component.](https://support.kaspersky.com/11938)\nThe System Watcher component has the ability to rollback the changes done by ransomware\nin the event that a malicious sample manages to bypass other defenses. This is extremely\nuseful in case a ransomware sample slips past defenses and attempts to encrypt the data on\nthe disk.\n\nAs we kept analysing the attack, we started learning more things; for instance, the infection\nrelied on a famous exploit, (codenamed “EternalBlue”), that has been made available on the\n[internet through the Shadowbrokers dump on April 14th, 2017 and patched by Microsoft on](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2017/ms17-010)\nMarch 14. Despite the fact the patch has been available for two months, it appeared that\n\n\n-----\n\nmany companies didn t patch. We put together a couple of blogs, updated our technical\nsupport pages and made sure all samples were detected and blocked even on systems that\nwere vulnerable to the EternalBlue exploit.\n\n[WannaCry ransomware used in widespread attacks all over the world](https://securelist.com/wannacry-ransomware-used-in-widespread-attacks-all-over-the-world/78351/)\n[WannaCry FAQ: What you need to know today](https://securelist.com/wannacry-faq-what-you-need-to-know-today/78411/)\n\nMeanwhile, as everyone was trying to research the samples, we were scouting for any\npossible links to known criminal or APT groups, trying to determine how a newcomer\nmalware was able to cause such a pandemic in just a few days. The explanation here is\nsimple – for ransomware, it is not very often that we get to see completely new, built from\nscratch, pandemic-level samples. In most cases, ransomware attacks make use of some\npopular malware that is sold by criminals on underground forums or, “as a service”.\n\nAnd yet, we couldn’t spot any links with known ransomware variants. Things became a bit\nclearer on Monday evening, when Neel Mehta, a researcher at Google, posted a mysterious\nmessage on Twitter with the #WannaCryptAttribution hashtag:\n\nThe cryptic message in fact referred to a similarity between two samples that have shared\ncode. The two samples Neel refers to in the post were:\n\nA WannaCry sample from February 2017 which looks like a very early variant\nA Lazarus APT group sample from February 2015\n\nThe similarity can be observed in the screenshot below, taken between the two samples,\nwith the shared code highlighted:\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough some people doubted the link, we immediately realized that Neel Mehta was right.\nWe put together a blog diving into this similarity, “WannaCry and Lazarus Group – the\nmissing link?”. The discovery of this code overlap was obviously not a random hit. For years,\n[Google integrated the technology they acquired from Zynamics into their analysis tools](https://www.eweek.com/security/google-buys-security-firm-zynamics)\nmaking it possible to cluster together malware samples based on shared code. Obviously,\nthe technology seemed to work rather nicely. Interestingly, one month later, an article was\n[published suggesting the NSA also reportedly believed in this link.](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/14/15805346/wannacry-north-korea-linked-by-nsa)\n\nThinking about the story, the overlap between WannaCry and Lazarus, we put a plan\ntogether – what if we built a technology that can quickly identify code reuse between\nmalware attacks and pinpoint the likely culprits in future cases? The goal would be to make\nthis technology available in a larger fashion to assist threat hunters, SOCs and CERTs speed\nup incident response or malware triage. The first prototype for this new technology was\navailable internally June 2017, and we continued to work on it, fine-tuning it, over the next\nmonths.\n\nIn principle, the problem of code similarity is relatively easy. Several approaches have been\ntested and discussed in the past, including:\n\nCalculating checksums for subs and comparing them against a database\nReconstructing the code flow and creating a graph from it; comparing graphs for similar\nstructures\nExtracting n-grams and comparing them against a database\nUsing fuzzy hashes on the whole file or parts of it\nUsing metadata, such as the rich header, exports or other parts of the file; although this\nisn’t code similarity, it can still yield some very good results\n\n\n-----\n\nTo find the common code between two malware samples, one can, for instance, extract all 816 byte strings, then check for overlaps. There’s two main problems to that though:\n\nOur malware collection is too big; if we want to do this for all the files we have, we’d\nneed a large computing cluster (read: thousands of machines) and lots of storage\n(read: Petabytes)\nCapex too small\n\nAdditionally, doing this massive code extraction, profiling and storage, not to mention\nsearching, in an efficient way that we can provide as a stand-alone box, VM or appliance is\nanother level of complexity.\n\nTo refine it, we started experimenting with code-based Yara rules. The idea was also simple\nand beautiful: create a Yara rule from the unique code found in a sample, then use our\nexisting systems to scan the malware collection with that Yara rule.\n\nHere’s one such example, inspired by WannaCry:\n\nThis innocent looking Yara rule above catches BlueNoroff (malware used in the Bangladesh\nBank Heist), ManusCrypt (a more complex malware used by the Lazarus APT, also known\nas FALLCHILL) and Decafett, a keylogger that we previously couldn’t associate with any\nknown APT.\n\n\n-----\n\nA breakthrough in terms of identifying shared code came in Sep 2017, when for the first time\nwe were able to associate a new, “unknown” malware with a known entity or set of tools. This\n[happened during the #CCleaner incident, which was initially spotted by Morphisec and Cisco](https://blog.morphisec.com/morphisec-discovers-ccleaner-backdoor)\nTalos.\n\nIn particular, our technology spotted a fragment of code, part of a custom base64 encoding\nsubroutine, in the Cbkrdr shellcode loader that was identical to one seen in a previous\nmalware sample named Missl, allegedly used by APT17:\n\nDigging deeper, we identified at least three malware families that shared this code: Missl,\nZoxpng/Gresim and Hikit as shown below in the Yara hits:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn particular, the hits above are the results of running a custom Yara rule, based on what we\ncall “genotypes” – unique fragments of code, extracted from a malware sample, that do not\nappear in any clean sample and are specific to that malware family (as opposed to being a\nknown piece of library code, such as zlib for instance).\n\nAs a side note, Kris McConkey from PwC delivered a wonderful dive into Axiom’s tools\nduring his talk “Following APT OpSec failures” at SAS 2015 – highly recommended if you’re\ninterested in learning more about this APT super-group.\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NFJqD-LcpIg\n\nSoon, the Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine – “KTAE” – also nicknamed internally “Yana”,\nbecame one of the most important tools in our analysis cycle.\n\n## Digging deeper, or more case studies\n\n\n-----\n\nThe United States Cyber Command, or in short, USCYBERCOM, began posting samples\n[to VirusTotal in November 2018, an excellent move in our opinion. The only drawback for](https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-cyber-command-starts-uploading-foreign-apt-malware-to-virustotal/)\nthese uploads was the lack of any context, such as the malware family, if it’s APT or criminal,\nwhich group uses them and whether they were found in the wild, or scooped from certain\nplaces. Although the first upload, a repurposed Absolute Computrace loader, wasn’t much of\n[an issue to recognize, an upload from May 2019 was a bit more tricky to identify. This was](https://twitter.com/CNMF_VirusAlert/status/1129474883463897091)\nimmediately flagged as Sofacy by our technology, in particular, as similar to known XTunnel\nsamples, a backdoor used by the group. Here’s how the KTAE report looks like for the\n[sample in question:](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b40909ac0b70b7bd82465dfc7761a6b4e0df55b894dd42290e3f72cb4280fa44/detection)\n\n**Analysis for d51d485f98810ab1278df4e41b692761**\n\nIn February 2020, USCYBERCOM posted another batch of samples that we quickly checked\nwith KTAE. The results indicated a pack of different malware families, used by several APT\ngroups, including Lazarus, with their BlueNoroff subgroup, Andariel, HollyCheng, with shared\n[code fragments stretching back to the DarkSeoul attack,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_South_Korea_cyberattack) [Operation Blockbuster and the](https://securelist.com/operation-blockbuster-revealed/73914/) SPE\nHack.\n\nGoing further, USCYBERCOM posted another batch of samples in May 2020, for which\n[KTAE revealed a similar pattern.](https://twitter.com/craiu/status/1260210051312226304)\n\n\n-----\n\nOf course, one might wonder, what else can KTAE do except help with the identification of\nVT dumps from USCYBERCOM?\n\n[For a more practical check, we looked at the samples from the 2018 SingHealth data breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_SingHealth_data_breach)\nthat, according to Wikipedia, was initiated by unidentified state actors. Although most\nsamples used in the attack are rather custom and do not show any similarity with previous\nattacks, two of them have rather interesting links:\n\n**KTAE analysis for two samples used in the SingHealth data breach**\n\nMofang, a suspected Chinese-speaking threat actor, was described in more detail in 2016 by\nthis FOX-IT research paper, written by Yonathan Klijnsma and his colleagues. Interestingly,\nthe paper also mentioned Singapore as a suspected country where this actor is active.\nAlthough the similarity is extremely weak, 4% and 1% respectively, they can easily point the\ninvestigator in the right direction for more investigation.\n\nAnother interesting case is the discovery and publication (“DEADLYKISS: HIT ONE TO\nRULE THEM ALL. TELSY DISCOVERED A PROBABLE STILL UNKNOWN AND\nUNTREATED APT MALWARE AIMED AT COMPROMISING INTERNET SERVICE\nPROVIDERS“) from our colleagues at Telsy of a new, previously unknown malware deemed\n“DeadlyKiss”. A quick check with KTAE on the artifact with sha256\nc0d70c678fcf073e6b5ad0bce14d8904b56d73595a6dde764f95d043607e639b (md5:\n608f3f7f117daf1dc9378c4f56d5946f) reveals a couple of interesting similarities with other\nPlatinum APT samples, both in terms of code and unique strings.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Analysis for 608f3f7f117daf1dc9378c4f56d5946f**\n\nAnother interesting case presented itself when we were analysing a set of files included in\none of the Shadowbrokers dumps.\n\n**Analysis for 07cc65907642abdc8972e62c1467e83b**\n\nIn the case above, “cnli-1.dll” (md5: 07cc65907642abdc8972e62c1467e83b) is flagged as\n[being up to 8% similar to Regin. Looking into the file, we spot this as a DLL, with a number of](https://securelist.com/regin-nation-state-ownage-of-gsm-networks/67741/)\ncustom looking exports:\n\n\n-----\n\nLooking into these exports, for instance, fileWriteEx, shows the library has actually been\ncreated to act as a wrapper for popular IO functions, most likely for portability purposes,\nenabling the code to be compiled for different platforms:\n\n\n-----\n\nSpeaking of multiplatform malware, recently, our colleagues from Leonardo published their\nawesome analysis of a new set of Turla samples, targeting Linux systems. Originally, we\n[published about those in 2014, when we discovered Turla Penquin, which is one of this](https://securelist.com/the-penquin-turla-2/67962/)\ngroup’s backdoors for Linux. One of these samples (sha256:\n67d9556c695ef6c51abf6fbab17acb3466e3149cf4d20cb64d6d34dc969b6502) was uploaded\nto VirusTotal in April 2020. A quick check in KTAE for this sample reveals the following:\n\n**Analysis for b4587870ecf51e8ef67d98bb83bc4be7 – Turla 64 bit Penquin sample**\n\nWe can see a very high degree of similarity with two other samples (99% and 99%\nrespectively) as well as other lower similarity hits to other known Turla Penquin samples.\nLooking at the strings they have in common, we immediately spot a few very good\ncandidates for Yara rules—quite notably, some of them were already included in the Yara\nrules that Leonardo provided with their paper.\n\n\n-----\n\n## When code similarity fails\n\nWhen looking at an exciting, brand new technology, sometimes it’s easy to overlook any\ndrawbacks and limitations. However, it’s important to understand that code similarity\ntechnologies can only point in a certain direction, while it’s still the analyst’s duty to verify and\n[confirm the leads. As one of my friends used to say, “the best malware similarity technology](https://twitter.com/VessOnSecurity)\nis still not a replacement for your brain” (apologies, dear friend, if the quote is not 100%\nexact, that was some time ago). This leads us to the case of OlympicDestroyer, a very\ninteresting attack, originally described and named by Cisco Talos.\n\nIn their [blog, the Cisco Talos researchers also pointed out that OlympicDestroyer used](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/olympic-destroyer.html)\nsimilar techniques to Badrabbit and NotPetya to reset the event log and delete backups.\nAlthough the intention and purpose of both implementations of the techniques are similar,\nthere are many differences in the code semantics. It’s definitely not copy-pasted code, and\nbecause the command lines were publicly discussed on security blogs, these simple\ntechniques became available to anyone who wants to use them.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, Talos researchers noted that the evtchk.txt filename, which the malware used as\na potential false-flag during its operation, was very similar to the filenames (evtdiag.exe,\nevtsys.exe and evtchk.bat) used by BlueNoroff/Lazarus in the Bangladesh SWIFT cyberheist\nin 2016.\n\nSoon after the Talos publication, the Israeli company IntezerLabs tweeted that they had\nfound links to Chinese APT groups. As a side node, IntezerLabs have an exceptional code\nsimilarity technology themselves that you can check out by visiting their site at\n[analyze.intezer.com.](https://analyze.intezer.com/)\n\n[IntezerLabs further released a blogpost with an analysis of features found using their in-](http://www.intezer.com/2018-winter-cyber-olympics-code-similarities-cyber-attacks-pyeongchang/)\nhouse malware similarity technology.\n\n\n-----\n\n[A few days later, media outlets started publishing articles suggesting potential motives and](https://www.scmagazineuk.com/2018-winter-olympics-hit-with-destroyer-malware-during-opening-ceremony/article/743928/)\nactivities by Russian APT groups: “Crowdstrike Intelligence said that in November and\nDecember of 2017 it had observed a credential harvesting operation operating in the\ninternational sporting sector. At the time it attributed this operation to Russian hacking group\nFancy Bear”…\n\nOn the other hand, Crowdstrike’s own VP of Intelligence, Adam Meyers, in an interview with\nthe media, said: “There is no evidence connecting Fancy Bear to the Olympic attack”.\n\nAnother company, Recorded Future, decided to not attribute this attack to any actor;\nhowever, they [claimed that they found similarities to BlueNoroff/Lazarus LimaCharlie](https://www.recordedfuture.com/olympic-destroyer-malware/)\nmalware loaders that are widely believed to be North Korean actors.\n\nDuring this “attribution hell”, we also used KTAE to check the samples for any possible links\nto previous known campaigns. And amazingly, KTAE discovered a unique pattern that also\nlinked Olympic Destroyer to Lazarus. A combination of certain code development\nenvironment features stored in executable files, known as a Rich header, may be used as a\nfingerprint identifying the malware authors and their projects in some cases. In the case of\nthe Olympic Destroyer wiper sample analyzed by Kaspersky, this “fingerprint” produced a\nmatch with a previously known Lazarus malware sample. Here’s how today’s KTAE reports\nit:\n\n**Analysis for 3c0d740347b0362331c882c2dee96dbf**\n\nThe 4% similarity shown above comes from the matches in the sample’s Rich header.\nInitially, we were surprised to find the link, even though it made sense; other companies also\nspotted the similarities and Lazarus was already known for many destructive attacks.\nSomething seemed odd though. The possibility of North Korean involvement looked way off\nmark, especially since Kim Jong-un’s own sister attended the opening ceremony in\nPyeongchang. According to our forensic findings, the attack was started immediately before\nthe official opening ceremony on 9 February, 2018. As we dug deeper into this case, we\nconcluded it was an elaborate false flag; further research allowed us to associate the attack\nwith the Hades APT group (make sure you also read our analysis: “Olympic destroyer is here\nto trick the industry“).\n\n\n-----\n\nThis proves that even the best attribution or code similarity technology can be influenced by\na sophisticated attacker, and the tools shouldn’t be relied upon blindly. Of course, in 9 out of\n10 cases, the hints work very well. As actors become more and more skilled and attribution\nbecomes a sensitive geopolitical topic, we might experience more false flags such as the\nones found in the OlympicDestroyer.\n\nIf you liked this blog, then you can hear more about KTAE and using it to generate effective\nYara rules during the upcoming “GReAT Ideas, powered by SAS” webinar, where, together\nwith my colleague Kurt Baumgartner, we will be discussing practical threat hunting and how\nKTAE can boost your research.
