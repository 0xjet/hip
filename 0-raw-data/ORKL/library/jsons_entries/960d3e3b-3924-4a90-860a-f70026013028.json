Cybercriminals commonly disguise malware as games, music, software, and other media content to\ndeceive users into downloading and installing malicious software on their devices.\n\n[One such sophisticated stealer is DuckTail, which was first identified by WithSecure Intelligence in July 2022. It](https://www.f-secure.com/content/dam/labs/docs/WithSecure_Research_DUCKTAIL.pdf)\nappears that the group behind DuckTail has been active since late 2021 and has been using .NETCore to carry out\ntheir attacks. However, according to the [Zscaler ThreatLabz Analysis, the group switched to using PHP in August](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/new-php-variant-ducktail-infostealer-targeting-facebook-business-accounts)\n2022. This demonstrates that cybercriminals are continually adapting their tactics to evade security measures.\n\nThe Yoroi ZLab has discovered evidence of new campaigns utilizing different tactics, including more complex delivery\nmechanisms and victimology, which began in April 2022. It is crucial for individuals and organizations to remain\ninformed about these tactics and take necessary precautions, such as exercising caution when downloading or\nclicking on links, maintaining up-to-date software and security measures, and educating themselves about the latest\nsecurity threats.\n\n## About the TA\n\nDucktail appears to be a persistent and consistent threat on the social media landscape, with a particular focus on\nFacebook. The attacker's objective is to compromise business social media accounts, possibly to carry out additional\nmalicious intrusions.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Yoroi Flashcard about DuckTail_\n\n_Threat Actor_\nThe threat actor's activity has intensified since the last few months of the previous year when they began creating\nvarious campaigns to entice social media users and persuade them to click on malicious links. One such campaign\ninvolves a fake website offering photos of models.\n\n_Figure 2: Example of a_\n\n_malicious campaign of December 2022_\nThe link leads to a media-hosting website claiming to enable the download of this malicious data.\n\n_Figure 3: Example of a fake file_\n\n_hosting page_\nThe threat actor behind this persistent malware campaign has taken significant measures to create a resilient and\neffective malicious infrastructure. The creation of a total of seven fake file hosting domains suggests that the threat\nactor is attempting to deceive users into believing that they are accessing legitimate files, when in fact they are\ndownloading malware hosted on the true hosting domains.\n\nBy hosting their files on multiple domains, the threat actor can ensure that their malware remains available even if one\nor more of the domains are taken down. Additionally, by using popular hosting services such as Mediafire and Google\nCloud, the threat actor may be attempting to blend in with legitimate users and avoid detection.\n\n\n-----\n\nFurthermore, the threat actor has also created three Facebook pages as part of their infrastructure, indicating that\nthey are using social media platforms to spread their malware. Social media platforms provide an easy way for the\nthreat actor to distribute their malware to many users quickly and easily. The use of Facebook pages may also allow\nthe threat actor to bypass some security measures that are designed to block known malicious websites.\n\nThe use of multiple fake and legitimate domains, as well as social media platforms, suggests that the threat actor is\nhighly motivated and determined to spread their malware. The threat actor has invested significant time and resources\ninto creating a resilient and effective malicious infrastructure.\n\nSome of the intercepted fake file hosting domains include:\n\ndownload5s.]com\nx-photos.]net\nbeautygirls-photos.]com\nbeautygirls-picture.]com\nphoto-cam.]com\nx-album.]com\nx-albums.]com\nx-pictures.]net\nhxxps://sites.google.]com/view/lonely-in-car\n\nTrue Hosting Domains:\n\ns1-download-photos.]com\njmooreassoc.]com\nmeetstaci.]com\nkimhasa.]com\nnotodaiya.]com\nkarbilyazilim.]com\nshble.]com\nvelascasadelaluz.]com\nhxxps://download2388.mediafire.]com/eif5tfodd4ng/hrcyyor418tp8hw/Album_Beautiful_Girl_In_The_Hotels.rar\nromeflirt.]com\nikejd.]com\nhxxps://storage.googleapis.]com/migc/AlbumNo6128183.zip\n\nPages:\n\ncamliveproduction\nThe-Best-moment-105684484236827\nxphotonetn\n\nBased on these starting points, it is possible to reconstruct the entire infection chain. In the following sections,\ntechnical details about all the phases of the infection chain will be provided.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: DuckTail Infection_\n\n_Chain_\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nWe observed two different campaigns of DuckTail, of which one is written in Python and another one is in PHP.\n\n### DuckTail Python Version – 1st Variant\n\nThe infection starts with a malicious zip archive containing many identical executable files, pretending to be images of\na gallery belonging to a model. This archive is retrieved on one of the fake storage websites we identified and\nreported in the previous section:\n\nHash fcec8d28e17f7af13d0961eb8b8d25eaf0e76e50fdc8cd4e2e79de7d6b67d25d\n\nThreat DuckTail Downloader\n\nBrief Description Archive containing multiple downloaders\n\nAn extract of that archive is the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Content of the initial malicious_\n\n_archive_\nThese files have all different hashes but the same behavior: use a powershell script to download an InnoSetup\nInstaller (c17524501439d58ffb701907d83e3e20558a445363fa0733bb328e0d69c91441) containing the core of\nDuckTail.\n\n_Figure 6: DuckTail_\n\n_Downloader_\nThat archive extracts all the files for the next step of the infection in one of the following paths:\n\n%AppData%\\Local\\Packages\\Rnews\\v13-15\n%AppData%\\Local\\Mozilla\\Conf\\v13-15\n%AppData%\\Local\\Google\\Conf\\v13-15\n%AppData%\\Local\\Packages\\Conf\\v13-15\n%AppData%\\Local\\Microsoft\\Conf\\v13-15\n%AppData%\\Local\\Media\\Conf\\v13-15\n\nThe package of DuckTail contains a series of files:\n\nrnews.exe (e1517e6bd6169c543083e36c45894a98b8ae592bf9dc265978f198af70a853b1) Ducktail\ncurl.exe curl tool\nRar.exe CLI WinRar tool\n[rhc tools](https://github.com/tostercx/hidec)\nPython DLLs and files\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: InnoSetup Files_\n\n[The program in question was created using Nuitka, a tool that transforms Python modules into a C-based program.](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka)\nThis allows the program to operate similarly to CPython, utilizing both \"libpython\" and its own static C files. Nuitka is a\ncompiler for Python that generates standalone binaries from Python scripts, making them more efficient and faster.\n\nUpon analyzing the program's strings, it appears that the program is specifically designed to target Facebook\nbusiness accounts. By obtaining an overview of the program's capabilities, we can better understand its intended\npurpose and how it may potentially harm targeted accounts.\n\n_Figure 8: String of_\n\n_rnews.exe_\nThe program described in the previous section steals Facebook-related information through the API, using a specific\nclient ID. More specifically, it obtains the victim token by making a request using the client ID \"124024574287414\",\nwhich happens to be the ID of \"Instagram\". By using this particular client ID, the program aims to avoid detection, as\nthe victim may not be suspicious when checking their settings and seeing that the request comes from Instagram.\n\nIt is worth noting that the use of APIs to extract data is a common tactic used by cybercriminals to gather sensitive\ninformation. APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are sets of protocols and tools used for building software\napplications. APIs can provide a convenient way to extract data from various platforms, but they can also be used\nmaliciously to steal data, as in this case.\n\nMoreover, Nuitka, the Python compiler used to generate the program, is a powerful tool that allows developers to\ncreate stand-alone executables from Python code. It does this by converting Python modules into C-based programs,\nwhich can run faster and use fewer resources than traditional Python code. Nuitka is an open-source project that is\n\n\n-----\n\nactively maintained and used by developers around the world.\n\nOverall, the use of Nuitka and APIs highlights the sophisticated tactics used by cybercriminals to steal sensitive\ninformation from their victims. As technology continues to advance, it is crucial for individuals and organizations to\nstay vigilant and take necessary precautions to protect their data and privacy.\n\nJoining the analysis of DuckTail and the permissions it asks to the API, we figured out it might steal the following\ninformation from Facebook:\n\nCredentials\nToken\nUID\nComplete information about victim account\n2FA Status\nRecovery Code\n\nAnd, Chrome, Firefox (Cookies, Passwords, Preferences, Bookmarks, History). Once finished it sends the stolen\ninformation to the following C2s:\n\nhxxps://riospress.]com/rss/news\nhxxps://ro2sport.]com/rss/news\n\nUses WMI to collect machine information:\n\n/namespace:\\\\\\\\root\\\\SecurityCenter2 path AntiVirusProduct get displayName\nWin32_VideoController GET VideoModeDescription\nWin32_VideoController GET Name\nWin32_PhysicalMemory GET Capacity\nWin32_Processor GET Name\n\n_Figure 9: Usage of wmic to_\n\n_collect SysInfo_\nThe collected information is written to a file called “info.json”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_SysInfo_\nDuckTail stores the config inside \"config.json\".\n\nWith the folliowing parameters:\n\n**Parameter** **Description**\n\nmachineld\n\nmid\n\nversion APP_VERSION (config.json)\n\nv APP_VERSION_DETAIL (config.json)\n\ntoken\n\npartner PARTNER (config.json)\n\ntime Date (Unix Epoch Timestamp Seconds)\n\ntime_ns Date (Unix Epoch Timestamp Nanoseconds)\n\nbotname Victim Username\n\npath\n\ncwd\n\nn Hostname\n\nr OS Version\n\nrv OS Version + Build Number\n\n\n_Figure 10: JSON of collected_\n\n_Figure 11: DuckTail Config_\n\n\n-----\n\nm Machine architecture\n\nu\n\ne\n\ns\n\n### DuckTail PHP Version – 4th Variant\n\nHash 0fad31fc16beeb24ca924a94614f3905f5c463a972ae395eec58614d014e73ad\n\nThreat DuckTail Dropper\n\nBrief Description Malicious DLL, loaded by using DLL Sideloading\n\nThe PHP variant of the malware utilizes a technique called DLL sideloading, which involves the use of a legitimate tool\nnamed \"WDSyncService.exe\" from Western Digital. This technique is often used by attackers to bypass security\nmeasures since it is harder for antivirus software to detect malicious activities that involve legitimate tools. The\nWDSyncService.exe tool is used to execute an InnoSetup installer, which is obfuscated through multiple layers to\navoid detection.\n\nThe DLL loaded by the malware is responsible for loading a specific resource identified by the GUID \"{9117cb49a00b-4379-8d00-32eeaa57627f}\". After decryption, this resource contains further instructions that are used by the\nmalware to continue the infection process. The use of encryption makes it difficult for security researchers to analyze\nthe code and understand the exact steps involved in the infection process.\n\nThe use of legitimate tools and techniques by attackers highlights the need for organizations to implement strong\nsecurity measures and keep their software and tools up-to-date. Furthermore, it is important to educate employees\nabout the risks of opening suspicious files and emails, and to establish security protocols that can help prevent\nattacks. Keeping systems patched and up-to-date, as well as using reliable antivirus software, can also help detect\nand prevent attacks. In summary, staying vigilant and proactive about security can help prevent malware infections\nand minimize their impact on an organization.\n\n_Figure 12: Malicious DLL_\n\n_loading the encrypted resource_\nTo elaborate on the previous text, the resource containing the next steps of the infection is AES encrypted, which is a\nwidely used encryption standard. Once decrypted, the resource contains several Base64 encoded strings. Instead of\ndecrypting each string when needed, all the encrypted strings are contained and decrypted in a single resource that is\ntreated as a data structure for the following steps.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis approach of containing and decrypting all the strings at once can be more efficient and harder to detect\ncompared to decrypting individual strings. The use of AES encryption and Base64 encoding can also make it more\ndifficult for security researchers to analyze and understand the malware.\n\nAdditionally, the use of DLL sideloading with a legitimate Western Digital Tool named “WDSyncService.exe” is a\ntechnique used by the threat actors to evade detection by antivirus software. By using a legitimate program, the\nmalware can blend in with normal processes, making it harder to detect and investigate.\n\nIt is worth noting that malware creators use various techniques to evade detection and compromise systems, and it is\nessential for users to remain vigilant and keep their systems updated with the latest security patches and antivirus\nsoftware. Regular backups of important data can also help to mitigate the damage caused by malware attacks.\n\n_Figure 13: Content of the_\n\n_encrypted resource_ _Figure_\n\n_14: Base64 Decoded Strings_\nThe sample proceeds by decrypting another resource ({9872ec39-1510-4b83-bbab-29deae7a2bde}) which is a\nportable executable (PE) file. This PE file contains another resource called \"subtitle1\", which is Base64 encoded. The\nPE file has four characters before the \"MZ\" signature that reads \"DPAI\". Additionally, two characters in the PE file are\nobfuscated and have been replaced by the symbols \"* \" and \"|\".\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15: Base64_\n\n_Encoded Payload and obfuscated_\nThe method employed to obfuscate the code fragments has been found to be effective in evading the detection of\nvarious automated analysis tools. However, it is still possible to manually deobfuscate the code by setting a breakpoint\non the \".NET\" function \"FromBase64String\" and comparing the decoded characters with those used for obfuscation.\nThis approach enables the decryption of the code, thereby revealing its true purpose.\n\nIt is worth noting that the use of obfuscation techniques is quite common in malware development. The primary\nobjective of employing such methods is to make it harder for analysts and researchers to reverse engineer the code\nand understand its functionality. The encrypted code can be easily decrypted if the algorithm and the key used for\nencryption are known. Therefore, obfuscation is used to add an additional layer of protection and make the code more\nresilient to reverse engineering techniques. However, with careful analysis and the use of advanced tools, it is often\npossible to deobfuscate the code and uncover its true nature.\n\n_Figure 16: Function_\n\n_responsible for the deobfuscation_\nAfter completing all the deobfuscation procedures, another binary sample protected by SmartAssembly emerges,\nwhich is a .NET binary. This sample contains encrypted data inside resources, which are again AES encrypted. The\nbinary first checks if there are any arguments passed to it by checking the length of the arguments. If there are no\narguments, the binary does not proceed with its execution.\"\n\nTo expand on the text, SmartAssembly is a .NET obfuscation tool used to protect software from reverse engineering. It\nis designed to make the analysis of the code as difficult as possible, by obfuscating names, methods and even entire\nclasses. The use of encryption, like AES, adds another layer of protection, making it even more challenging to reverse\nengineer.\n\nThe fact that the binary checks for arguments before proceeding with execution suggests that it may be designed to\nbe run in a specific way or with specific parameters. This can make it more difficult to execute and analyze the binary,\nas the user must understand how to correctly pass arguments to it in order for it to work properly. This can be another\neffective technique for evading detection by automated analysis tools.\n\n_Figure 17: Check arguments_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe code protection structure of this sample is quite similar to the previous packer sample. It involves decrypting a list\nof Base64 strings, which leads to a Base64 encoded Portable Executable (PE). However, this time, an anti-repeat\ncheck is performed in the process.\n\nThe anti-repeat check is used to ensure that the malware is not installed on the same system multiple times. This is\ndone by checking the system for the presence of a specific file or registry key, which is usually created during the first\ninstallation. If the file or registry key exists, the installation is terminated.\n\nOnce the anti-repeat check is completed, the malware proceeds with its execution. It typically performs various\nmalicious activities, such as stealing sensitive data, recording keystrokes, and installing additional malware\ncomponents.\n\nIt is worth noting that the use of Base64 encoding and other obfuscation techniques by malware authors aims to\nevade detection by security software. However, security researchers often use tools and techniques to deobfuscate\nand analyze such code, enabling them to identify and mitigate the threats posed by such malware.\n\n_Figure 18: Checks if the_\n\n_sample has been already executed_\nThe code structure of this packer sample is quite similar to the previous one. A list of Base64 strings is decrypted, and\nthen a Base64 encoded PE is extracted. However, this time an anti-repeat check is performed to prevent duplication\nof the same code. From the list of Base64 strings, the program selects \"m.txt.\" It then checks if this file exists, and if it\ndoes, the program returns/exits. Otherwise, it proceeds to decrypt another resource containing a PE that, in turn,\ncontains another resource which is also another Base64 obfuscated PE.\n\n_Figure 19: m.txt the name of the_\n\n_file used for the anti-repeat check_\n\n_Figure 20: Checks the_\n\n_existence of m.txt in the given path_\nBy completing the same self-decoding steps as previously analyzed, we were able to retrieve the final payload, an\nInnoSetup installer containing other malicious code with the MD5 hash of\n8c60a4691f610e325597af83ee2c99945e7eb1cb189fff03cf2264e461fead53.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 21: Final Payload_\n\nThe final stage of the malware execution involves saving a file named \"AYSVDAWHDAADAOC.exe\" as\n\"C:\\Users\\Admin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\" and then executing it. During this process, the malware ensures persistence\nby creating a scheduled task.\n\n_Figure 22: Persistence_\n\n_Figure 23: Scheduled Task_\n\nThe InnoSetup installer contains two PHP samples - \"index.php\" and \"include.php\" - along with \"php.exe\" and \"rss.txt\".\nThese PHP samples are obfuscated using the IonCube Loader, a commercial protector that is commonly used to\nensure copyright protection for specific web applications built using the PHP framework.\n\n_Figure 24: DuckTail PHP_\n\n_Samples_\nThe \"rss.txt\" file is a Base64-encoded PE that is obfuscated using the same technique of missing characters. In this\ncase, the missing characters are \"*\", \"|\", and \"+\". By examining other Base64-encoded PEs, we can easily determine\nthat these missing characters are respectively replaced by \"A\", \"B\", and \"g\". Once decoded, this file returns another\ncomponent that is written in Rust and has the MD5 hash value of\n\"16ad22f8ab4f99a03bc2b68bf3314397f30f67a01bb5a283020e85979b811d93\".\n\nMemory analysis of the malware also reveals the C2s (Command and Control servers) of the malicious infrastructure.\nThese C2s are:\n\n\n-----\n\nrapadtrai.]com\ngraeslavur.]com\ncaseiden.]com\nte5.techgeetam.]com\nsensetria.]com\n\nIt is important to note that these C2s may change over time as the malware evolves and adapts to new environments.\n\n_Figure 25: In Memory Strings_\n\n**Decoding an unprotected version**\n\nRegrettably, we were unsuccessful in our attempt to decrypt IonCube, but we discovered additional samples that were\nnot encrypted and resolved to conduct further analysis based on these samples. Among these samples is \"index.php\"\n(5bac0b4ee00c1cb9a5b2969a18077ab74257790bd2610224253d3faf58714f43), which contains the DuckTail code.\nThe behavior of the code is consistent across all its variants, with its primary goal being the collection of Facebook\naccount information belonging to its victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 26: index.php DuckTail Sample_\n\ninclude.php (8fd4910dd8b05c9ea617f9b86f31aac5663db12495e9295ccaf19e3d58b8b3b4) establishes persistence\nusing the task scheduler and decodes “rss.txt” executable. In this way, the malicious implant guarantees itself a\nmechanism to download.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 27: Task triggering at logon_\n\n_Figure 28: Task triggering on interval_\n\nThe following is the function responsible for decoding and deobfuscating the payload contained in rss.txt and for\ngetting the current time by executing this payload, this time is used for calculating the task interval.\n\n\n-----\n\n_deobfuscating and executing the Rust Payload to get the current time_\nThe method used to calculate the task interal is the following:\n\n_task interval_\n\n**Rss.txt – Rust Chrome key decoder**\n\n\n_Figure 29: Decoding,_\n\n_Figure 30: Calculating the_\n\n\nThe Rust payload is also responsible for decrypting the Chrome encrypted_key.

Malware analysis is an essential process that helps\nto uncover the hidden tactics and techniques used by attackers. Understanding the methods of cybercriminals can\nassist cybersecurity professionals in developing more effective security measures to detect and mitigate potential\nthreats. This can include blocking IP addresses, shutting down servers, and identifying the attacker's location.\n\n\n-----\n\nTracking malicious infrastructures can also help in sharing threat intelligence within the cybersecurity community. The\ncyber threat landscape is constantly evolving, and by sharing information, organizations and security experts can stay\ninformed and up-to-date with the latest threats. This can help other organizations and security experts to take\nnecessary precautions and protect themselves against similar attacks.\n\nFurthermore, tracking malicious infrastructures can help in developing new security measures and improving existing\nones to prevent future attacks. By analyzing and understanding the tools and techniques used by attackers,\ncybersecurity professionals can develop more effective security measures that can detect and mitigate potential\nthreats.
