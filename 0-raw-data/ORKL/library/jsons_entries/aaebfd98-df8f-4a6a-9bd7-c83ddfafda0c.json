But like the Death Star’s gravitational pull, the\n\nstory keeps drawing us back in as new information comes to light. Following our post on DCLeaks as a Russian in�uence operation\n\n[https://threatconnect.com/blog/does-a-bear-leak-in-the-woods/], [Bellingcat [https://www.bellingcat.com/] founder](https://www.bellingcat.com/) Eliot Higgins\n\n[https://www.bellingcat.com/author/eliothiggins/] reached out to us. Bellingcat, a group of citizen investigative journalists, has\n\npublished articles critical of Russia and has been a key contributor to the international investigation of the shootdown of\n\n[Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_17] over Ukraine in 2014.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_17)\n\nHiggins shared data with ThreatConnect that indicates Bellingcat has come under sustained targeting by Russian threat actors,\n\nwhich allowed us to identify a 2015 spearphishing campaign that is consistent with FANCY BEAR’s tactics, techniques, and\n\nprocedures. We also analyzed a February 2016 attack by CyberBerkut — a group claiming to be pro-Russian Ukrainian hacktivists\n\nbut also a suspected front for Moscow — against Russia-based Bellingcat contributor Ruslan Leviev\n\n[https://twitter.com/RuslanLeviev], where CyberBerkut defaced the Bellingcat website and leaked Leviev’s personal details. As\n\nevidenced by these e�orts and the attack on the World Anti-Doping Agency [https://threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-anti\ndoping-agency-phishing/], organizations that negatively impact Russia’s image can expect Russian cyber operations intended to\n\nretaliate publicly or privately, in�uence, or otherwise maliciously a�ect them. The Diamond Model\n\n[http://www.activeresponse.org/the-diamond-model/] below summarizes the activity that Bellingcat experienced.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Claim Your Free Account**\n\n\n##### Bellingcat Background\n\nBellingcat is a group of citizen investigative journalists — [named after a classic fable [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belling_the_cat]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belling_the_cat)\n\n— that uses open source information, such as photos and videos posted on social media, maps, and publicly available satellite\n\nimagery. Bellingcat articles have focused on a variety of current events in Africa, the Middle East, the U.S., and Europe with a\n\nspeci�c focus on notable con�icts related to Syria, Ukraine, and Russia.\n\nBellingcat published its �rst post on July 5, 2014, and for the next twelve days focused mainly on the ongoing Syrian civil war,\n\ncovering developments such as the use of chemical weapons, but also occasionally pointing out Russian involvement. On July 17,\n\n2014, Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 crashed in pro-Russian rebel territory in eastern Ukraine and Bellingcat released their �rst post\n\n[[https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/case-studies/2014/07/17/geolocating-the-missile-launcher-linked-to-the-downing-of-](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/case-studies/2014/07/17/geolocating-the-missile-launcher-linked-to-the-downing-of-mh17/)\n\nmh17/] on the topic. Over the next two years, Bellingcat would publish no fewer than 92 posts\n\n[https://www.bellingcat.com/tag/mh17/] from at least 8 [contributors [https://www.bellingcat.com/contributors/] focused on](https://www.bellingcat.com/contributors/)\n\nRussian involvement in the downing of MH17, using open source information and imagery to prove the presence of the Russian\n\nmilitary in eastern Ukraine and that a Russian-supplied Buk missile launcher shot down MH17 from pro-Russian rebel territory.\n\nThe Kremlin vehemently denies this.\n\nThe Dutch took the lead in the criminal investigation through an international Joint Investigation Team (JIT)\n\n[https://www.om.nl/onderwerpen/mh17-crash/] and o�cially considered Bellingcat’s reporting in their investigation. Founder Eliot\n\nHiggins was included as an o�cial witness. The Dutch Safety Board ultimately found\n\n[[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/10/13/a-dutch-report-will-say-what-downed-mh17-it-wont-blame-](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/10/13/a-dutch-report-will-say-what-downed-mh17-it-wont-blame-the-russians/)\n\nthe-russians/] MH17 was shot down by a [Russian-made surface-to-air missile [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDiLEyT9spI]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDiLEyT9spI)\n\nbut declined to assign blame for who was responsible for the launch. On September 28, the JIT is due to release\n\n[http://www.nltimes.nl/2016/08/22/mh17-dutch-criminal-investigation-results-ready-sept-28/] the results of their criminal\n\ninvestigation.\n\nCompromising Bellingcat contributors could provide Russian intelligence services with journalists’ contacts and sources, personal\n\ninformation, insight into future reporting perceived as indemnifying Russia, as well as sensitive personal information. Such\n\ncollection could facilitate in�uence operations and retaliation e�orts against Bellingcat, or access that could be leveraged for\n\nfollow-on operations. Compromising Bellingcat contributors’ accounts could also provide access to communications with the JIT,\n\no�ering a glimpse at how the investigation of the downing of MH17 was proceeding.\n\n##### Activity Targeting Bellingcat\n\nTimeline\n\nThe timeline below summarizes the notable dates related to the MH17 crash and investigation, Bellingcat’s articles related to\n\n\n-----\n\n**Claim Your Free Account**\n\n\nFANCY BEAR\n\nFrom February 2015 to July 2016 three researchers at Bellingcat — Higgins, Aric Toler, and Veli-Peka Kivimaki — who had\n\ncontributed MH17 articles received numerous spearphishing emails, with Higgins alone receiving at least 16 phishing emails\n\ntargeting his personal email account. A majority of the campaign took place from February to September 2015, with some activity\n\nresuming in May 2016. These spearphishing attempts consist of a variety of spoofed Gmail security notices alerting the target that\n\nsuspicious activity was detected on their account. The target is prompted to click a URL resembling a legitimate Gmail security link\n\nto review the details of this suspicious activity. Below are screenshots of some of the spearphishing email targeting Bellingcat\n\nresearchers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Claim Your Free Account**\n\n\nThe attackers used several methods to redirect the target to credential harvesting pages. In at least 21 of the emails, the URL\n\nredirects the victim to a shortened Bitly URL. These shortened Bitly links, in turn, direct the victim to another Google-spoo�ng URL\n\nappended with the [base64 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64] encoded target email and name. One of the emails used a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)\n\nshortened TINYCC URL to achieve the same e�ect. In four of the other emails, the security links direct the target to a Google Sites\n\npage that spoofs a Google login page. Once the target visits the Bitly, TINYCC, or Google Sites URLs, they are prompted to enter\n\ntheir Google credentials, which would then be captured by the threat actors.\n\nThe speci�cally crafted URLs with target-speci�c strings are consistent with a FANCY BEAR technique highlighted in Dell\n\nSecureworks research [https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-4127-targets-hillary-clinton-presidential-campaign]\n\nand [employed against a DNC sta�er [https://threatconnect.com/blog/does-a-bear-leak-in-the-woods/] whose �les were leaked on](https://threatconnect.com/blog/does-a-bear-leak-in-the-woods/)\n\nDCLeaks. Reviewing the click information for the Bitly links, we identi�ed that at least three of the Bitly URLs targeting the same\n\nBellingcat individual were accessed in the timeframe consistent with the spearphishing attack. This suggests the individual clicked\n\non the links in three of the spearphishing messages, but Bellingcat con�rms that no credentials were supplied to these pages.\n\nOther consistencies with Russia and FANCY BEAR activity were also identi�ed. In early May and again in mid-June 2016 the\n\nBellingcat contributor Aric Toler’s personal email address was targeted by FANCY BEAR. Using ThreatConnect’s Email Import\n\nfunction, we are able to identify that both messages abused Moscow-based Yandex email services to send malicious emails to the\n\n\n-----\n\n**Claim Your Free Account**\n\n\nIn the June 2016 example, Toler was targeted with a message that used hellomail1@yandex[.]com in a manner consistent\n\n[https://threatconnect.com/blog/does-a-bear-leak-in-the-woods/] with how Billy Rinehart was targeted prior to content from his\n\npersonal Gmail being posted to DCLeaks.\n\nBy analyzing the email headers provided by Bellingcat, we identi�ed domains and corresponding IP addresses that the attackers\n\nleveraged as part of the spearphishing operation. The table below also shows the registrant for the domain, the creation date for\n\nthe WHOIS record, and the name server the domain used during the attack timeframe.\n\n\n**SPEARPHISHING DOMAIN**\n\n\n**MAILSERVER**\n\n**IP**\n\n\n**DOMAIN REGISTRANT**\n\n\n**DOMAIN CREATE**\n\n**DATE**\n\n\n**NAME SERVER DURING ATTA**\n\n\nmxx evrosatory[ ]com 46 22 208 204 andre roy@mail com 2/13/14 Carbon2u com\n\n\n-----\n\nmxx.us-westmail\nundeliversystem[.]com\n\n\n**Claim Your Free Account**\n\n46.22.208.204 andre_roy@mail.com 2/28/14 Carbon2u.com\n\n\nmx1.servicetransfermail[.]com 95.153.32.53 theforeignnews@gmail.com 6/3/15 Cata501836.earth.orderbox-dns.co\n\naccounts.google.com.rnil[.]am 198.105.122.187 Private 7/7/14 Carbon2u.com\n\nmx6.set132[.]com 198.105.122.187 emmer.brown@mail.com 9/30/14 Carbon2u.com\n\nserver.mx4.set132[.]com 46.22.208.204 emmer.brown@mail.com 9/30/14 Carbon2u.com\n\n\nThe domains evrosatory[.]com,us-westmail-undeliversystem[.]com have been previously identi�ed\n\n[http://pwc.blogs.com/�les/tactical-intelligence-bulletin---sofacy-phishing-.pdf] by Pricewaterhouse Coopers as FANCY BEAR, and\n\nthe domain servicetransfermail[.]com closely resembles the servicetransferemail[.]com infrastructure that German Intelligence\n\n(BvF) established as FANCY BEAR within Cyber Brief Nr. 01/2016 [https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/download/broschuere-2016\n03-bfv-cyber-brief-2016-01.pdf] .\n\nFANCY BEAR also previously used both the [Cata501836 [https://threatconnect.com/blog/does-a-bear-leak-in-the-woods/] and](https://threatconnect.com/blog/does-a-bear-leak-in-the-woods/)\n\nCarbon2u name servers to host infrastructure and email addresses from 1&1’s mail.com to register domains\n\n[https://threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-it-itch-they-cant-scratch/] . We were able to identify further overlaps with other FANCY\n\nBEAR infrastructure by pivoting o� of these indicators, which we will describe in a later blog post. Based on these consistencies, we\n\nassess FANCY BEAR almost certainly is behind the spearphishing and credential harvesting campaign targeting Eliot Higgins and\n\nother Bellingcat researchers.\n\nCyberBerkut Activity\n\nCyberBerkut describes itself as a group of pro-Russian Ukrainian hacktivists. They borrow the “Berkut\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkut_(special_police_force)] ” name from the now disbanded Ukrainian riot police who responded\n\nbrutally to the 2014 [EuroMaidan [https://www.net�ix.com/title/80031666] demonstrations in Kiev.

This range suggests highly capable actors are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkicw3EolCg)\n\nbehind CyberBerkut and they employ a high degree of operational planning when considering the o�ensive use of information\n\nand their e�ects.\n\nCyberBerkut [defaced [https://twitter.com/bellingcat/status/697334674029412353] the Bellingcat webpage on February 10, 2016,](https://twitter.com/bellingcat/status/697334674029412353)\n\nclaiming credit for the attack and singling out Ruslan Leviev, a Russian opposition blogger and Bellingcat contributor.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Claim Your Free Account**\n\n\nLeviev published a [compelling piece [https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/05/22/three-graves/] of citizen](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/05/22/three-graves/)\n\njournalism on May 22, 2015 exploring the fate of Russian Spetsnaz soldiers believed to have been killed in combat operations\n\nwithin Ukraine earlier that month. According to Bellingcat founder Higgins, Leviev’s contributor account was compromised and\n\nused to post the CyberBerkut message. In an email interview, Leviev makes the following statement regarding the events that led\n\nto the compromise of his credentials and the defacement.\n\nIn my case, my old email account, which was located on Yandex servers, was hacked. The email account had a long, di�cult\n\npassword, not a word, from various letters, numbers, and special symbols. Plus there was a telephone number bound to the\n\naccount for second factor authentication.\n\nExactly how it was hacked — I don’t know.\n\n######  Either they as employees, or with their active assistance, intercepted the SMS authentication code.\n\n  Or they, again, as an o�cer from the authorities or with their active assistance, gained direct access to the Yandex Mail servers\n\nwhere they seized the email from my old inbox.\n\n######  Or they know about a vulnerability in Yandex email that nearly nobody else knows about.\n\nHaving seized the old email inbox, they used the password recovery mechanism for LiveJournal. My LiveJournal account (which I\n\nhave not used for a long time) was connected to my old email address, but LiveJournal does not provide second factor\n\nauthentication. Via password recovery of my LiveJournal from my stolen email, they took over my LiveJournal account and made a\n\npost.\n\nIn the same stolen email account, they found my username and password for my account at Bellingcat (I had once published an\n\ninvestigation directly on the Bellingcat website) and they published a post there in my name.\n\nAt the same time, my icloud account was not setup for second factor authentication, and was connected only to my old email\n\naddress for password recovery, it was also taken over. They performed a password recovery via my stolen email address for\n\nicloud, logged in, but I received a noti�cation on my iPhone about it, and I quickly cut o� their access, but they were able to\n\ndownload some photos.\n\nThey also tried to hack my Facebook and Twitter. They were unable to crack Facebook, because I had second factor authentication\n\nand always need to enter the code generated by the Facebook app. They were able to login to Twitter and change the password\n\nbut nothing was deleted and they didn’t tweet anything. I restored the password.\n\nBased on all the data, I assume that, as in the case of Alburovym, Kozlovsky, Parkhomenko, this was the activity of security services\n\nwho intercepted the SMS containing the access code. So they got access to my old email account and they also gained access to\n\nmy Twitter account (which was also under two-factor, but code is sent via SMS rather than generated in an app).\n\nOf my social networks where two-factor codes are generated via an application, they were unable to crack. Of my social networks\n\nwhere the two-factor code was sent via SMS, they were able to crack.\n\n\n-----\n\nfactor authentication to compromise his old Yandex email account. Leviev goes on to describe that the actors then used emailsClaim Your Free Account\n\nfrom that old account to compromise his iCloud account and access pictures and other information saved from Leviev’s phone to\n\niCloud. Some of this information was ultimately put in a February 24, 2016 post on CyberBerkut’s website that contained sensitive\n\ndetails of Leviev’s personal life, such as his pictures, phone number, address, passport scan, girlfriend’s name, and dating and\n\nsexual preferences.\n\nThese attacks were an overt attempt to discredit Bellingcat research and Leviev, but also carried a message to others who publicly\n\nvoice positions critical of Moscow that this form of journalism does not go unnoticed. We also found it interesting how much e�ort\n\nwas expended and the degree of sources and methods exposed to achieve a simple defacement. We do not know whether the\n\nattackers intercepted Leviev’s SMS-based two-factor authentication or had direct access to Yandex mail servers, but either tactic is\n\nmore suggestive of a state-backed actor as opposed to independent hacktivists.\n\n##### CyberBerkut and FANCY BEAR: Not the Same, But Showing Up to the Same Party\n\nThroughout our research, we have focused on FANCY BEAR, an advanced persistent threat (APT) group assessed to be Russian\n\ngovernment. CyberBerkut, on the other hand, was a referential data point when we looked at precedence for pro-Russian proxies\n\ninterfering with elections. CrowdStrike assessed in its 2015 Global Threat Report [https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ\n266/images/15GlobalThreatReport.pdf] “there are indications that CyberBerkut has ties to Russian state security,” but the degree\n\nof Russian government control over the group is disputed.\n\nThe timing of the FANCY BEAR spearphishing campaigns and the CyberBerkut attack against Leviev are interesting. The concerted\n\nFANCY BEAR spearphishing e�orts over a six month timeframe in 2015 shows Moscow’s clear intent to compromise Bellingcat,\n\nmost likely due to their posts on key current events involving Russia. This activity was followed by a hard stop and then additional\n\ntargeted e�orts by CyberBerkut in early 2016, which was in-turn followed by additional FANCY BEAR spearphishing from May to\n\nJuly 2016. A key assumption underlying any assessment about how these activities are related stems from how an analyst\n\nassesses the motives for targeting Leviev.\n\nWe came up with two scenarios:\n\nStronger/Closer Coordination Between FANCY BEAR and CyberBerkut. In this scenario, the activities against Bellingcat are\n\ncoordinated with these two entities handing o� operations. The timing suggests that the state actors, looking to compromise\n\nBellingcat, pivoted to a more aggressive attack against Leviev when the initial spearphishing campaign failed to yield the desired\n\nresults. Leviev is targeted more aggressively as a means to get at Bellingcat and since he lives in Russia, state actors would have\n\nadditional tools in their kit to intercept his SMS two-factor authentication messages or gain direct access to Yandex’s mail servers.\n\nIn this scenario, CyberBerkut functions as much as a strategic messaging outlet as the actual attacker and is subject to a much\n\ngreater degree of direction and control from Moscow than previously assessed.\n\nThe Common Enemies Approach: Weaker/Less Coordination Between FANCY BEAR and CyberBerkut. In this scenario, the\n\nspearphishing campaigns conducted by FANCY BEAR are distinct in purpose and perpetrator from the CyberBerkut attack against\n\nLeviev. The spearphishing campaigns are more focused on Bellingcat’s coverage of the MH17 shootdown and involvement in the\n\nJIT investigation. CyberBerkut targets Leviev separately after his coverage of Russian military involvement in eastern Ukraine with\n\nsome assistance from supportive friends in Moscow to compromise his Yandex account. Targeting Leviev is less about a broader\n\ncompromise of Bellingcat and more about harassing one journalist. In this scenario, CyberBerkut is advancing Moscow’s interests\n\nand can call on the Russian intelligence services, but is still a distinct group.\n\n##### Leak Sites Leaking Over\n\nWe looked to see if we could identify other overlaps between FANCY BEAR and CyberBerkut that would help us assess which of\n\nthese two scenarios was more likely. Through our research into the Bellingcat activity, we found some surprising content overlaps\n\nwith DCLeaks — another assessed Russian in�uence outlet — and a CyberBerkut pattern of registering infrastructure that FANCY\n\nBEAR also uses. These developments move the needle slightly towards a more coordinated relationship between the two groups,\n\nbut not decisively.\n\nComparing DCLeaks and CyberBerkut\n\nIn [our previous post [https://threatconnect.com/blog/does-a-bear-leak-in-the-woods/], we identi�ed a website called DCLeaks as a](https://threatconnect.com/blog/does-a-bear-leak-in-the-woods/)\n\nRussian-backed in�uence outlet. Information shared with ThreatConnect indicates that there is an association of some kind\n\nbetween the Guccifer 2.0 persona and the DCLeaks website. Shortly after publication, we became aware of a cache of documents\n\nleaked on the DCLeaks site. The �les were allegedly obtained via a compromise of an organization a�liated with George Soros. It\n\nis interesting to note that earlier in 2016 CyberBerkut also published �les purportedly associated with Soros.\n\n\n-----\n\nwho works for ESET, suggests that the content of the two leaks are similar with at least three of the Soros documentsClaim Your Free Account\n\n[https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/08/22/turns-out-you-cant-trust-russian-hackers-anymore/] being found on both sites. The\n\nacquisition and publication of documents belonging to, or in some way associated with, the same individual is of interest as\n\noverlaps in targeting and potential similarities in stolen content could be indicative of a connection between DCLeaks and\n\nCyberBerkut. Further, as we have identi�ed that there is a connection from DCLeaks to Guccifer 2.0 and from Guccifer 2.0 to\n\nFANCY BEAR, the overlap in leaked documents may suggest that both leak sites obtained their data from the same collection\n\nsource, FANCY BEAR.\n\nWhile this alone isn’t enough to verify a relationship between the sites, there are some other interesting similarities. Despite their\n\nstatuses as a U.S.-focused whistleblower and hacktivist group respectively, the websites of both DCLeaks and CyberBerkut\n\nprimarily host content that is critical of individuals and governments perceived to oppose Russian foreign and domestic policies.\n\nBoth sites attempt to appeal to civilian masses in the U.S. and Ukraine respectively by calling attention to purported in the political\n\nsystems.\n\nAleksandr Panchenko\n\nCyberBerkut’s main domain, cyber-berkut[.]org, was registered using privacy protection through the registrar Internet.bs and\n\nshortly thereafter hosted using CloudFlare infrastructure. Several other CyberBerkut-related domains redirect to this website.\n\nMost of these domains were also registered using privacy protection, but one domain, cyber-berkut[.]net was registered by\n\n“Aleksandr Panchenko” using the email address alex_panchenko@mail[.]com. The same day the domain was registered through\n\nReg.ru, it was later routed to CloudFlare infrastructure, suggesting that this domain was not opportunistically procured by a\n\ndomain registrant in hopes they could sell it to the CyberBerkut actors.\n\nAdditional research into this name and email address identi�es six other CyberBerkut-related domains, none of which are active\n\ncurrently, registered by this individual:\n\n######  Cyber-berkut[.]su\n\n  Cyber-berkut[.]tk\n\n  Cyber-berkut[.]us\n\n  Cyber-berkut[.]me\n\n  Cyber-berkut[.]cz\n\n  Cyber-berkut[.]im\n\nWhile certainly not de�nitive, the use of a mail.com email address to register domains is consistent with recently identi�ed FANCY\n\nBEAR registration activity against the [DCCC [https://threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-it-itch-they-cant-scratch/],](https://threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-it-itch-they-cant-scratch/) WADA, and CAS\n\n[https://threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-anti-doping-agency-phishing/] .\n\n##### Tracing out FB Infrastructure Based on Bellingcat Input\n\nThe activity that Bellingcat alerted us to provided a plethora of domains, IP addresses, email addresses, and other registration and\n\nhosting information for us to pivot o� of to identify other pertinent infrastructure. In an upcoming blog post, we’ll seek to identify\n\n\n-----\n\nindustry partners.\n\n\n**Claim Your Free Account**\n\n\nReviewing the CATA501836 and Carbon2u name servers, we were able to identify dozens of active domains that �t the FANCY\n\nBEAR mold and likely spoof organizations that Moscow would seek to compromise.\n\nPivoting o� of Bellingcat’s email headers we were able to identify hundreds of domains and IPs, and dozens of email addresses\n\nand aliases most likely used by FANCY BEAR, some of which were not previously identi�ed. This review primarily identi�ed\n\nhistorical FANCY BEAR information, but the conclusions from it help verify FANCY BEAR TTP assessments, provide additional\n\ntargeting context, and may be useful in retrospective reviews of malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe campaign against Bellingcat provides yet another example of sustained targeting against an organization that shines a light on\n\nRussian per�dy. The spearphishing campaign is classic FANCY BEAR activity while CyberBerkut’s role raises yet more questions\n\nabout the group’s ties to Moscow. These end-to-end cyber operations begin with targeting and exploitation and end with strategic\n\nleaks and other active measures employed against those with whom they disagree.\n\nThese e�orts go above and beyond traditional intelligence requirements such as gaining insight into a sensitive project or sources.\n\nVilifying the messenger and dumping their personal data is part of the game, intended to intimidate and embarrass those that\n\nspeak ill of Moscow. If Russia is willing to go to these lengths to compromise a small journalist organization and its contributors,\n\nconsider what they are willing to do to major news and media outlets that publish similar articles. While many organizations\n\nremain reticent to share information, this knowledge is the prerequisite to establishing how widespread such e�orts are and the\n\nadversary’s modus operandi.\n\nThe BEARs win if their active measures campaigns push, scare, or intimidate their targets into doing what they want. If you\n\nencounter a BEAR, you’re doing something right. Don’t back down. And turn on two-factor authentication for everything.\n\n### Update\n\nOn October 5 2016, probable FANCY BEAR actors again sent a spearphishing message to a Bellingcat contributor. This\n\nspearphishing message spoofed Google security services, similar to those previously used to target Bellingcat.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Claim Your Free Account**\n\n\nFANCY BEAR used a shortening service to mask the malicious link, similar to the previous messages, but it appears the actors\n\nattempted to obfuscate their activity by using two separate shortening services to hide the �nal malicious link. The tiny.cc link that\n\nis in the spearphishing message actually points to a TinyURL shortened URL.\n\nThe TinyURL in turn points to the below URL:\n\nhxxp://myaccount.google.com-changepassword-securitypagesettingmyaccountgooglepagelogin.id833[.]ga\n\nThis URL is appended with a target-speci�c base64 encoded string as was seen in the previous spearphishing messages targeting\n\nBellingcat and others.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe id833[.]ga domain is hosted at the 89.40.181[.]119 IP (Bucharest, RO) which also hosts the domain id834[.]ga. There is a\n\nsubdomain for the id834[.]ga similar to the URL above that is also hosted at the same IP. This suggests that the id834[.]ga domain\n\nhas also been operationalized, though we have no information indicating who has been targeted with it. The WHOIS records for\n\nthese domains did not contain any additional information on the registrants or other domains they may have registered.\n\nUsing ThreatConnect’s Email Import feature, we identi�ed that the spearphishing message was sent through Yandex mail servers\n\nusing the email address g.mail2017@yandex[.]com.\n\nThis was the �rst identi�ed spearphish against Bellingcat since July 2016 and suggests that FANCY BEAR activity against them is\n\nongoing. Other organizations involved in the MH17 investigation that would draw Moscow’s ire should be on the lookout for\n\nsimilar activity.\n\n**Categories:** [Blog,](https://www.threatconnect.com/category/blog/) [Featured Article,](https://www.threatconnect.com/category/featured-article/) [Research](https://www.threatconnect.com/category/blog/blog-research/)\n\n#### A B O U T T H E A U T H O R\n\n\n-----\n\n**Claim Your Free Account**\n\n\nThe ThreatConnect Research Team: is an elite group of globally-acknowledged cybersecurity experts, dedicated to tracking\n\ndown existing and emerging cyber threats.
