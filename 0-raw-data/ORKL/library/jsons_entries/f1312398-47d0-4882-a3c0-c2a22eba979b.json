Cursory investigation into the malware showed the\nattackers not only had flair for malware naming, but also for choosing interesting targets for their malware: nearly all the\ntargeting we were able to uncover related to activity in Ukraine.\n\nPivoting further on the initial samples we discovered, and their infrastructure, revealed a modestly sized campaign going\n[back to late 2015 using both Quasar RAT (https://github.com/quasar/QuasarRAT) and VERMIN.](https://github.com/quasar/QuasarRAT)\n\nThis blog shows the links between the activity observed, a walkthrough of the analysis of the VERMIN malware, and IOCs\nfor all activity discovered.\n\n### It all began with a tweet\n\n[Our initial interest was piqued through a tweet (https://twitter.com/blu3_team/status/917050823724732419) from a fellow](https://twitter.com/blu3_team/status/917050823724732419)\nresearcher who had identified some malware with an interesting theme relating to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense as a\nlure.\n\n\n-----\n\n(https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ukr_MoD_Lure.jpeg)\n\n_Figure 1 – The decoy document displayed to users when executing the initial malware sample_\n\nThe sample was an SFX exe which displayed a decoy document to users before continuing to execute the malware; the\nhash of the file is given below.\n\nSHA256 31a1419d9121f55859ecf2d01f07da38bd37bb11d0ed9544a35d5d69472c358e\n\n[The malware was notable for its rare use of HTTP encapsulated SOAP (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP), an XML based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP)\nprotocol used for exchanging structured information, for command and control (C2), which is something not often seen in\nmalware samples. Using AutoFocus, we were quickly able to find similar samples, by pivoting on the artifacts the malware\ncreated during a sandbox run, resulting in 7 other samples as shown in Figure 2.\n\n(https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Vermin2.png)\n\n_Figure 2 – Pivoting in AutoFocus makes it easy to find similar malware samples._\n\n[Using the Maltego for AutoFocus (https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/Maltego-for-AutoFocus/ct-p/AutoFocus_Maltego)](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/Maltego-for-AutoFocus/ct-p/AutoFocus_Maltego)\ntransforms, we were then able to take the newly discovered samples and look at the C2 infrastructure in an attempt to see if\nwe could link the samples together and in turn see if these C2’s were contacted by malware. We quickly built up a picture of\na campaign spanning just over 2 years with a modest C2 infrastructure:\n\n|SHA256|31a1419d9121f55859ecf2d01f07da38bd37bb11d0ed9544a35d5d69472c358e|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n(https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Vermin_High_Res2.png)\n\n_Figure 3 – Further analysis using AutoFocus & other data sources allows us to link up the activity discovered so far._\n\nThe malware samples we discovered fell largely into two buckets: Quasar Rat and VERMIN. Quasar RAT is an open-source\nmalware family which has been used in several other attack campaigns including criminal\n[(https://community.rsa.com/community/products/netwitness/blog/2017/10/02/malspam-delivers-rat-spyware-quasar-9-27-](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/netwitness/blog/2017/10/02/malspam-delivers-rat-spyware-quasar-9-27-2017)\n2017) and espionage (https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/01/unit42-downeks-and-quasar-rat-used-inrecent-targeted-attacks-against-governments/) motivated attacks. But a reasonable number of the samples were the new\nmalware family, VERMIN. Looking at the samples in our cluster we could see the themes of the dropper files were similar to\nour first sample. Notably, most of the other files we discovered did not come bundled with a decoy document and instead\nwere simply the malware and dropper compiled with icons matching popular document viewing tools, such as Microsoft\nWord. Names of some of the other dropper binaries observed are given below, with the original Ukrainian on the left and the\ntranslated English (via Google) on the right:\n\n|Original Name (Ukrainian)|Translated Name (if applicable)|\n|---|---|\n|Ваш_ сертиф_кати для отримання безоплатно_ вторинно_ допомоги.exe|Your certificate for free_receive help.exe|\n|доповідь2.exe|report2.exe|\n|доповідь забезпечення паливом 08.06.17.exe|fuel supply report 08.06.17.exe|\n|lg_svet_smeta2016- 2017cod.exe.|N/A|\n|lugansk_2273_21.04.2017.exe|N/A|\n\n\nОтчет-районы_2квл-2016.exe\n\n\nReport-areas_2kv-l-2016.exe\n\n\n-----\n\np\n\n### Dissecting VERMIN\n\nFor this walkthrough, we’ll be going through the analysis of the following sample:\n\nSHA256 98073a58101dda103ea03bbd4b3554491d227f52ec01c245c3782e63c0fdbc07\n\nCompile 2017-07-04 12:46:43 UTC\nTimestamp\n\nAnalyzing the malware dynamically quickly gave us a name for the malware, based on the PDB string present in the memory\nof the sample:\n\nZ:\\Projects\\Vermin\\TaskScheduler\\obj\\Release\\Licenser.pdb\n\nAs is the case with many of the samples from the threat actors behind VERMIN, our sample is packed initially with the\n[popular .NET obfuscation tool ConfuserEx (https://yck1509.github.io/ConfuserEx/). Using a combination of tools, we were](https://yck1509.github.io/ConfuserEx/)\nable to unpack and deobfuscate the malware.\n\nFollowing initial execution, the malware first checks if the installed input language (https://technet.microsoft.com/enus/library/cc766191(v=ws.10).aspx) in the system is equal to any of the following:\n\nru – Russian\nuk – Ukrainian\nru-ru – Russian\nuk-ua – Ukrainian\n\nIf none of the languages above is found the malware calls “Application.Exit() (https://msdn.microsoft.com/enus/library/ms157894(v=vs.110).aspx)”, however despite its name, this API call doesn’t actually successfully terminate the\napplication, and instead the malware will continue to run. It’s likely the author intended to terminate the application, in\nwhich case a call like “System.Environment.Exit()” would have been a better choice. The fact that this functionality does not\nwork as intended suggests that if author tested the malware before deployment, they were likely to be doing so on systems\nwhere the language matches the list above, since otherwise they would notice that the function is not working as expected.\n\nAfter passing the installed language check the malware proceeds to decrypt an embedded resource using the following\nlogic:\n\nIt retrieves the final four bytes of the encrypted resource.\nThese four bytes are a CRC32 sum, and the malware then proceeds to brute force what 6-byte values will give this\nCRC32 sum.\nOnce it finds this array of 6 bytes it performs an MD5 hash sum on the bytes, this value is used as the key.\nThe first 16bytes of the encrypted resource are then used as the IV for decryption\nFinally, using AES it decrypts the embedded resource.\n\nA script mirroring this routine can be found in appendix C.\n\nAfter decrypting the embedded resource, the malware passes several hardcoded arguments to the newly decrypted binary\nand performs a simple setup routine before continuing execution. The embedded resource contains all the main code for\ncommunications and functionality the RAT contains.\n\nFirst the malware attempts to decrypt all of the strings passed as parameters. If no arguments were supplied the malware\nattempts to read a configuration file from a pre-defined location expecting it to be base64-encoded and encrypted with 3DES using a hardcoded key “KJGJH&^$f564jHFZ”:\n\nC:\\Users\\Admin\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\AddIns\\settings.dat\n\nIf arguments were supplied, they are saved and encrypted to the same location as above.\n\nParameters supplied are given below. Note that these are the actual variable names used by the malware author:\n\nserverIpList\nmypath\nkeyloggerPath\nmutex\nusername\npassword\nkeyloggerTaskName\n\n|SHA256|98073a58101dda103ea03bbd4b3554491d227f52ec01c245c3782e63c0fdbc07|\n|---|---|\n|Compile Timestamp|2017-07-04 12:46:43 UTC|\n\n\n-----\n\nkeyLoggerProcessName\nmyTaskDecription\nmyTaskAuthor\nkeyLoggerTaskDecription\nkeyLoggerTaskAuthor\n\nThe decrypted resource is set to be run as a scheduled task every 30 minutes, indefinitely.\n\nAfter this, the malware is ready to start operations, and does so by collecting various information about the infected\nmachine, examples of collected information includes but is not limited to:\n\nMachine name\nUsername\nOS name via WMI query\nArchitecture: x64 vs x86 (64 vs. 32 bit)\nLocal IP Address\nChecks Anti-Virus installed via WMI query\n\nIf the Anti-Virus (AV) query determines any AV is installed the malware does not install the keylogger. The keylogger is\nembedded as a resource named ‘AdobePrintFr’. This binary is only packed with Confuser-Ex and is not further obfuscated.\n\nThe malware then sends its initial beacon using a SOAP envelope to establish a secure connection. The author uses the\nWSHttpBinding() API – which allows the author to use WS-Addressing and purposely sets the WSMessageEncoding.Mtom\nto encode the SOAP messages. The author also sets up for using ‘Username’ authentication for communicating with its C2,\npresumably allowing the author easier control over the various infected hosts.

The data is encrypted using the same method and 3-DES\nkey, used to encrypt the configuration file.\n\nVermin supports the following commands:\n\nArchiveAndSplit\nCancelDownloadFile\nCancelUploadFile\nCheckIfProcessIsRunning\nCheckIfTaskIsRunning\nCreateFolder\nDeleteFiles\nDeleteFolder\nDownloadFile\n\n\n-----\n\nKillProcess\nReadDirectory\nRenameFile\nRenameFolder\nRunKeyLogger\nSetMicVolume\nShellExec\nStartAudioCapture\nStartCaptureScreen\nStopAudioCapture\nStopCaptureScreen\nUpdateBot\nUploadFile\n\nFor most of these commands, the malware requires “hands-on-keyboard” style one-to-one interactions.\n\nOften remote access tools written in .NET borrow and steal code from other tools due to the plethora of code available\nthrough open source; however, it appears that whilst some small segments of code may have been lifted from other tools,\nthis RAT is not a fork of a well-known malware family: it’s mostly original code.\n\nWe have linked all the samples we have been able to identify to the same cluster of activity: this strongly suggests the\nVERMIN malware is used exclusively by this threat actor and this threat actor alone.\n\n### Concluding thoughts\n\nWe were unable to definitively determine the aims of the attackers or the data stolen. However, given the limited number of\nsamples, the targeting themes observed, and the “hands-on-keyboard” requirement for most of the malwares’ operations\n(except for keylogging), it seems likely that the malware is used in targeted attacks in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine remains a ripe target for attacks, even gaining its own dedicated Wikipedia page\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_cyberattacks_on_Ukraine) for attacks observed in 2017. In addition to the high-profile\n[attacks such as the Petya/NotPetya (https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/06/28/petya_notpetya_ransomware/)
