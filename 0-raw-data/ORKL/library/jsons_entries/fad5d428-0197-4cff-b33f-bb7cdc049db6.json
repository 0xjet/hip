From the text of the message, the targets are\npharmacies, universities, doctors, and other entities fighting the new coronavirus contagion.\n\nThe attacker also cloned the FOFI website and registered a domain name similar to the\noriginal. However, they used “fofl.it,“ with a lowercase ”L“ as the last character that is easily\nconfused with the lowercase ‘i’ used in the legitimate domain name.\n\nAn [email sample from tech consultant Dottor Marc, shows that the message ends with](https://www.dottormarc.it/farmacie-sotto-accatto-immuni-diventa-un-virus-che-cripta-i-file/)\ndownload links and contact information that combines email addresses from the attacker\nand FOFI.\n\nWhen executed, the malware shows a fake dashboard with COVID-19 information allegedly\nfrom the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nWhile users are watching the map, the [F]Unicorn starts encrypting data on the system.\nAccording to analysis published by CERT AgID, the malware scans /Desktop, /Links,\n/Contacts, /Documents, /Downloads, /Pictures, /Music, /OneDrive, /Saved Games,\n/Favorites, /Searches, and /Videos for the following file types:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n.Txt, .jar, .exe, .dat, .contact, .settings, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx,\n.odt, .jpg, .png, .csv,. py, .sql, .mdb, .sln, .php, .asp, .aspx, .html, .htm, .xml,\n.psd, .pdf, .dll, .c, .cs, .mp3, .mp4, .f3d, .dwg, .cpp, .zip, .rar, .mov, .rtf,\n.bmp, .mkv, .avi, .apk, .lnk, .iso, .7-zip, .ace, .arj, .bz2, .cab, .gzip, .lzh,\n.tar, .uue, .xz, .z, .001, .mpeg, .mp3, .mpg, .core, .crproj, .pdb, .ico, .pas,\n.db, .torrent \"\n\n```\nFiles encrypted with [F]Unicorn get a new extension as seen in the image below:\n\nUsers learn that their files have been locked from a ransom note written in Italian, which\nindicates an Italian author. The oddity of the message aside, the ransom note asks victims\nto pay EUR 300 in three days or the data would be lost.\n\nA bitcoin address is provided along with an email address to contact the attacker with the\nproof of the payment. There are no transactions recorded for the given wallet.\n\n\n-----\n\nTranslated, the ransom note reads this:\n```\nThe long snake on Asceplio's staff has rebelled, and a new era is about to come!\nThis is your chance to redeem yourself after years of sins and abuses.\nIt's up to you to choose. Within 3 days the pledge to pay you will have to or the\nfire of Prometheus will cancel your data just as it has wiped out the power of Gods\nover men. The pledge is only 300 euros, to be paid with Bitcoins at the following\naddress: 195naAM74WpLtGHsKp9azSsXWmBCaDscxJ after you have paid, an email to send us\nyou will. xxcte2664@protonmail.com the transaction code will be the proof.\nAfter the paid pledge you will receive the solution to put out Prometheus' fire. Go\nfrom\npolice or calling technicians will be of no use, no human being can help you.\n\n```\nAccording to CERT-AgID, the password for encrypting the files is sent in clear text to the\nattacker, so it can be retrieved from the network traffic logs.\n\nDottor Marc says that [F]Unicorn is the work of a novice attacker with little technical\nknowledge, who used the code from a previously seen ransomware.\n\nTheir analysis also shows that the email address in the ransom note is invalid so there is no\npossibility to send the attacker the payment proof. This is another reason for victims not to\npay.\n\n[Security researcher MalwareHunterTeam told BleepingComputer that it is heavily based on](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\n[Hidden Tear.
