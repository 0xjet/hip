Also according to the resolution, the\nmeasures can be reviewed at any time, depending on the result of efforts to normalize the\nsystems.\"\n\n## RansomExx behind the attack\n\nWhile the official STJ statements do not mention the ransomware gang responsible for this\nattack, a ransom note recovered from one of the encrypted computers shows that the\nRansomExx gang was behind it.\n\nRansomExx sent BleepingComputer the following message when contacted for more\ndetails regarding the attack:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nHello,\nIgnore this message if you aren't officially represent whole affected company.\nSend us any encrypted file (not greater than 1MB) for test decryption.\nThen we will send you detailed instructions.\nThis step is necessary because we don't share such information for anyone except\nauthorized persons.\nSpeak english.\n\n```\nAccording to an anonymous source, Pernambuco State Court of Justice (Tribunal de\nJustiça do Estado de Pernambuco — TJPE) systems were also hit by RansomExx on\nOctober 27, with their files being encrypted using the .tjpe911 extension.\n\n[RansomExx is a rebranded Defray777 ransomware version that became a lot more](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomexx/)\nactive during June 2020 and known for attacking high-profile organizations.\n\n**STJ ransom note**\nThe [Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT),](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-impacts-texas-department-of-transportation/) [Konica Minolta,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/business-technology-giant-konica-minolta-hit-by-new-ransomware/) [IPG Photonics, and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/leading-us-laser-developer-ipg-photonics-hit-with-ransomware/)\n[Tyler Technologies are among the gang's previous victims.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/government-software-provider-tyler-technologies-hit-by-ransomware/)\n\nDuring their attacks, RansomExx's operators compromise the victims' networks and steal\nunencrypted sensitive documents while spreading laterally to other systems.\n\nOnce the RansomExx operators successfully compromise the victims' Windows domain\ncontroller, they deploy the ransomware payloads on all available network devices.\n\n_This is a developing story ..._\n\n_H/T Altieres_\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Luxury fashion house Zegna confirms August ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/luxury-fashion-house-zegna-confirms-august-ransomware-attack/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[Brazil](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/brazil/)\n[RansomEXX](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomexx/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
