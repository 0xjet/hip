Explicit financially-motivated targeting is unusual\namong Chinese state-sponsored threat groups, and evidence suggests APT41 has\nconducted simultaneous cyber crime and cyber espionage operations from 2014 onward.\n\nThe [full published report covers historical and ongoing activity attributed to APT41, the](https://www.mandiant.com/media/11251/download)\nevolution of the group’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), information on the\nindividual actors, an overview of their malware toolset, and how these identifiers overlap with\nother known Chinese espionage operators. APT41 partially coincides with public reporting on\n[groups including BARIUM (Microsoft) and Winnti (Kaspersky,](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/01/25/detecting-threat-actors-in-recent-german-industrial-attacks-with-windows-defender-atp/) [ESET,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/03/11/gaming-industry-scope-attackers-asia/) [Clearsky).](https://www.clearskysec.com/winnti/)\n\n**Who Does APT41 Target?**\n\nLike other Chinese espionage operators, APT41 espionage targeting has generally aligned\nwith [China's Five-Year economic development plans. The group has established and](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/The%2013th%20Five-Year%20Plan_Final_2.14.17_Updated%20%28002%29.pdf)\nmaintained strategic access to organizations in the healthcare, high-tech, and\ntelecommunications sectors. APT41 operations against higher education, travel services,\nand news/media firms provide some indication that the group also tracks individuals and\nconducts surveillance. For example, the group has repeatedly targeted call record\ninformation at telecom companies. In another instance, APT41 targeted a hotel’s reservation\nsystems ahead of Chinese officials staying there, suggesting the group was tasked to\nreconnoiter the facility for security reasons.\n\nThe group’s financially motivated activity has primarily focused on the video game industry,\nwhere APT41 has manipulated virtual currencies and even attempted to deploy ransomware.\nThe group is adept at moving laterally within targeted networks, including pivoting between\nWindows and Linux systems, until it can access game production environments. From there,\nthe group steals source code as well as digital certificates which are then used to sign\nmalware. More importantly, APT41 is known to use its access to production environments to\ninject malicious code into legitimate files which are later distributed to victim organizations.\nThese supply chain compromise tactics have also been characteristic of APT41’s best known\nand most recent espionage campaigns.\n\nInterestingly, despite the significant effort required to execute supply chain compromises and\nthe large number of affected organizations, APT41 limits the deployment of follow-on\nmalware to specific victim systems by matching against individual system identifiers. These\nmulti-stage operations restrict malware delivery only to intended victims and significantly\nobfuscate the intended targets. In contrast, a typical spear-phishing campaign’s desired\ntargeting can be discerned based on recipients' email addresses.\n\nA breakdown of industries directly targeted by APT41 over time can be found in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\nTimeline of industries directly targeted by APT41\n\n\nFigure 1: Timeline of industries directly targeted by APT41\n\n**Probable Chinese Espionage Contractors**\n\nTwo identified personas using the monikers “Zhang Xuguang” and “Wolfzhi” linked to APT41\noperations have also been identified in Chinese-language forums. These individuals\nadvertised their skills and services and indicated that they could be hired. Zhang listed his\nonline hours as 4:00pm to 6:00am, similar to APT41 operational times against online gaming\ntargets and suggesting that he is moonlighting. Mapping the group’s activities since 2012\n(Figure 2) also provides some indication that APT41 primarily conducts financially motivated\noperations outside of their normal day jobs.\n\nAttribution to these individuals is backed by identified persona information, their previous\nwork and apparent expertise in programming skills, and their targeting of Chinese marketspecific online games. The latter is especially notable because APT41 has repeatedly\n\n\n-----\n\nreturned to targeting the video game industry and we believe these activities were formative\nin the group’s later espionage operations.\n\nOperational activity for gaming versus non-gaming-related targeting based on\nobserved operations since 2012\n\n\nFigure 2: Operational activity for gaming versus non-gaming-related targeting based on\nobserved operations since 2012\n\n**The Right Tool for the Job**\n\nAPT41 leverages an arsenal of over 46 different malware families and tools to accomplish\ntheir missions, including publicly available utilities, malware shared with other Chinese\nespionage operations, and tools unique to the group. The group often relies on spearphishing emails with attachments such as compiled HTML (.chm) files to initially compromise\ntheir victims. Once in a victim organization, APT41 can leverage more sophisticated TTPs\n\n\n-----\n\nand deploy additional malware. For example, in a campaign running almost a year, APT41\ncompromised hundreds of systems and used close to 150 unique pieces of malware\nincluding backdoors, credential stealers, keyloggers, and rootkits.\n\nAPT41 has also deployed rootkits and Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits on a limited basis\nto hide their malware and maintain persistence on select victim systems. The use of bootkits\nin particular adds an extra layer of stealth because the code is executed prior to the\noperating system initializing. The limited use of these tools by APT41 suggests the group\nreserves more advanced TTPs and malware only for high-value targets.\n\n**Fast and Relentless**\n\nAPT41 quickly identifies and compromises intermediary systems that provide access to\notherwise segmented parts of an organization’s network. In one case, the group\ncompromised hundreds of systems across multiple network segments and several\ngeographic regions in as little as two weeks.\n\nThe group is also highly agile and persistent, responding quickly to changes in victim\nenvironments and incident responder activity. Hours after a victimized organization made\nchanges to thwart APT41, for example, the group compiled a new version of a backdoor\nusing a freshly registered command-and-control domain and compromised several systems\nacross multiple geographic regions. In a different instance, APT41 sent spear-phishing\nemails to multiple HR employees three days after an intrusion had been remediated and\nsystems were brought back online. Within hours of a user opening a malicious attachment\nsent by APT41, the group had regained a foothold within the organization's servers across\nmultiple geographic regions.\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nAPT41 is a creative, skilled, and well-resourced adversary, as highlighted by the operation’s\ndistinct use of supply chain compromises to target select individuals, consistent signing of\nmalware using compromised digital certificates, and deployment of bootkits (which is rare\namong Chinese APT groups).\n\nLike other Chinese espionage operators, APT41 appears to have moved toward strategic\nintelligence collection and establishing access and away from direct intellectual property theft\nsince 2015. This shift, however, has not affected the group's consistent interest in targeting\nthe video game industry for financially motivated reasons. The group's capabilities and\ntargeting have both broadened over time, signaling the potential for additional supply chain\ncompromises affecting a variety of victims in additional verticals.\n\nAPT41's links to both underground marketplaces and state-sponsored activity may indicate\nthe group enjoys protections that enables it to conduct its own for-profit activities, or\nauthorities are willing to overlook them. It is also possible that APT41 has simply evaded\n\n\n-----\n\nscrutiny from Chinese authorities. Regardless, these operations underscore a blurred line\nbetween state power and crime that lies at the heart of threat ecosystems and is exemplified\nby APT41.\n\n[Read the report today to learn more.](https://www.mandiant.com/media/11251/download)\n\n\n-----",
