Defenders are only beginning to\nrecognize and apply the power of generative AI to shift the cybersecurity balance in their\nfavor and keep ahead of adversaries. At the same time, it is also important for us to\nunderstand how AI can be potentially misused in the hands of threat actors. In\ncollaboration with OpenAI, today we are publishing research on emerging threats in the\nage of AI, focusing on identified activity associated with known threat actors, including\nprompt-injections, attempted misuse of large language models (LLM), and fraud. Our\nanalysis of the current use of LLM technology by threat actors revealed behaviors\nconsistent with attackers using AI as another productivity tool on the offensive landscape.\n[You can read OpenAI’s blog on the research here. Microsoft and OpenAI have not yet](https://openai.com/blog/disrupting-malicious-uses-of-ai-by-state-affiliated-threat-actors)\nobserved particularly novel or unique AI-enabled attack or abuse techniques resulting\nfrom threat actors’ usage of AI. However, Microsoft and our partners continue to study this\nlandscape closely.\n\nThe objective of Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI, including the release of this\nresearch, is to ensure the safe and responsible use of AI technologies like ChatGPT,\nupholding the highest standards of ethical application to protect the community from\npotential misuse. As part of this commitment, we have taken measures to disrupt assets\nand accounts associated with threat actors, improve the protection of OpenAI LLM\ntechnology and users from attack or abuse, and shape the guardrails and safety\nmechanisms around our models. In addition, we are also deeply committed to using\ngenerative AI to disrupt threat actors and leverage the power of new tools, including\n[Microsoft Copilot for Security, to elevate defenders everywhere.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot)\n\n## A principled approach to detecting and blocking threat actors\n\nThe progress of technology creates a demand for strong cybersecurity and safety\n[measures. For example, the White House’s Executive Order on AI requires rigorous](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/)\nsafety testing and government supervision for AI systems that have major impacts on\nnational and economic security or public health and safety. Our actions enhancing the\nsafeguards of our AI models and partnering with our ecosystem on the safe creation,\nimplementation, and use of these models align with the Executive Order’s request for\ncomprehensive AI safety and security standards.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn line with Microsoft’s leadership across AI and cybersecurity, today we are announcing\nprinciples shaping Microsoft’s policy and actions mitigating the risks associated with the\nuse of our AI tools and APIs by nation-state advanced persistent threats (APTs),\nadvanced persistent manipulators (APMs), and cybercriminal syndicates we track.\n\nThese principles include:\n\n**Identification and action against malicious threat actors’ use: Upon detection of**\nthe use of any Microsoft AI application programming interfaces (APIs), services, or\nsystems by an identified malicious threat actor, including nation-state APT or APM,\nor the cybercrime syndicates we track, Microsoft will take appropriate action to\ndisrupt their activities, such as disabling the accounts used, terminating services, or\nlimiting access to resources.\n\n**Notification to other AI service providers: When we detect a threat actor’s use of**\nanother service provider’s AI, AI APIs, services, and/or systems, Microsoft will\npromptly notify the service provider and share relevant data. This enables the\nservice provider to independently verify our findings and take action in accordance\nwith their own policies.\n\n**Collaboration with other stakeholders: Microsoft will collaborate with other**\nstakeholders to regularly exchange information about detected threat actors’ use of\nAI. This collaboration aims to promote collective, consistent, and effective\nresponses to ecosystem-wide risks.\n\n**Transparency: As part of our ongoing efforts to advance responsible use of AI,**\nMicrosoft will inform the public and stakeholders about actions taken under these\nthreat actor principles, including the nature and extent of threat actors’ use of AI\ndetected within our systems and the measures taken against them, as appropriate.\n\nMicrosoft remains committed to responsible AI innovation, prioritizing the safety and\nintegrity of our technologies with respect for human rights and ethical standards. These\n[principles announced today build on Microsoft’s Responsible AI practices, our voluntary](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai)\n[commitments to advance responsible AI innovation and the Azure OpenAI Code of](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/07/21/commitment-safe-secure-ai/)\n[Conduct. We are following these principles as part of our broader commitments to](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/code-of-conduct)\n[strengthening international law and norms and to advance the goals of the Bletchley](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-2023-the-bletchley-declaration/the-bletchley-declaration-by-countries-attending-the-ai-safety-summit-1-2-november-2023)\n[Declaration endorsed by 29 countries.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-2023-the-bletchley-declaration/the-bletchley-declaration-by-countries-attending-the-ai-safety-summit-1-2-november-2023)\n\n## Microsoft and OpenAI’s complementary defenses protect AI platforms\n\nBecause Microsoft and OpenAI’s partnership extends to security, the companies can take\n[action when known and emerging threat actors surface. Microsoft Threat Intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/security/security-insider/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2023/)\ntracks more than 300 unique threat actors, including 160 nation-state actors, 50\nransomware groups, and many others. These adversaries employ various digital\nidentities and attack infrastructures. Microsoft’s experts and automated systems\n\n\n-----\n\ncontinually analyze and correlate these attributes, uncovering attackers’ efforts to evade\ndetection or expand their capabilities by leveraging new technologies. Consistent with\npreventing threat actors’ actions across our technologies and working closely with\npartners, Microsoft continues to study threat actors’ use of AI and LLMs, partner with\nOpenAI to monitor attack activity, and apply what we learn to continually improve\ndefenses. This blog provides an overview of observed activities collected from known\nthreat actor infrastructure as identified by Microsoft Threat Intelligence, then shared with\nOpenAI to identify potential malicious use or abuse of their platform and protect our\nmutual customers from future threats or harm.\n\nRecognizing the rapid growth of AI and emergent use of LLMs in cyber operations, we\ncontinue to work with MITRE to integrate these LLM-themed tactics, techniques, and\n[procedures (TTPs) into the MITRE ATT&CK® framework or MITRE ATLAS™ (Adversarial](https://attack.mitre.org/)\nThreat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems) knowledgebase. This strategic\nexpansion reflects a commitment to not only track and neutralize threats, but also to\npioneer the development of countermeasures in the evolving landscape of AI-powered\ncyber operations. A full list of the LLM-themed TTPs, which include those we identified\nduring our investigations, is summarized in the appendix.\n\n## Summary of Microsoft and OpenAI’s findings and threat intelligence\n\nThe threat ecosystem over the last several years has revealed a consistent theme of\nthreat actors following trends in technology in parallel with their defender counterparts.\nThreat actors, like defenders, are looking at AI, including LLMs, to enhance their\nproductivity and take advantage of accessible platforms that could advance their\nobjectives and attack techniques. Cybercrime groups, nation-state threat actors, and\nother adversaries are exploring and testing different AI technologies as they emerge, in\nan attempt to understand potential value to their operations and the security controls they\nmay need to circumvent. On the defender side, hardening these same security controls\nfrom attacks and implementing equally sophisticated monitoring that anticipates and\nblocks malicious activity is vital.\n\nWhile different threat actors’ motives and complexity vary, they have common tasks to\nperform in the course of targeting and attacks. These include reconnaissance, such as\nlearning about potential victims’ industries, locations, and relationships; help with coding,\nincluding improving things like software scripts and malware development; and\nassistance with learning and using native languages. Language support is a natural\nfeature of LLMs and is attractive for threat actors with continuous focus on social\nengineering and other techniques relying on false, deceptive communications tailored to\ntheir targets’ jobs, professional networks, and other relationships.\n\nImportantly, our research with OpenAI has not identified significant attacks employing the\nLLMs we monitor closely. At the same time, we feel this is important research to publish\nto expose early-stage, incremental moves that we observe well-known threat actors\n\n\n-----\n\nattempting, and share information on how we are blocking and countering them with the\ndefender community.\n\nWhile attackers will remain interested in AI and probe technologies’ current capabilities\nand security controls, it’s important to keep these risks in context. As always, hygiene\n[practices such as multifactor authentication (MFA) and Zero Trust defenses are essential](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-mfa-multi-factor-authentication)\nbecause attackers may use AI-based tools to improve their existing cyberattacks that rely\non social engineering and finding unsecured devices and accounts.\n\nThe threat actors profiled below are a sample of observed activity we believe best\n[represents the TTPs the industry will need to better track using MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org/)\n[framework or MITRE ATLAS™ knowledgebase updates.](https://attack.mitre.org/)\n\n## Forest Blizzard\n\n[Forest Blizzard (STRONTIUM) is a Russian military intelligence actor linked to GRU Unit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/tag/forest-blizzard-strontium/?sort-by=newest-oldest&date=any)\n26165, who has targeted victims of both tactical and strategic interest to the Russian\ngovernment. Their activities span across a variety of sectors including defense,\ntransportation/logistics, government, energy, non-governmental organizations (NGO), and\ninformation technology. Forest Blizzard has been extremely active in targeting\norganizations in and related to Russia’s war in Ukraine throughout the duration of the\nconflict, and Microsoft assesses that Forest Blizzard operations play a significant\nsupporting role to Russia’s foreign policy and military objectives both in Ukraine and in\nthe broader international community. Forest Blizzard overlaps with the threat actor\ntracked by other researchers as APT28 and Fancy Bear.\n\nForest Blizzard’s use of LLMs has involved research into various satellite and radar\ntechnologies that may pertain to conventional military operations in Ukraine, as well as\ngeneric research aimed at supporting their cyber operations. Based on these\nobservations, we map and classify these TTPs using the following descriptions:\n\n**LLM-informed reconnaissance: Interacting with LLMs to understand satellite**\ncommunication protocols, radar imaging technologies, and specific technical\nparameters. These queries suggest an attempt to acquire in-depth knowledge of\nsatellite capabilities.\n**LLM-enhanced scripting techniques: Seeking assistance in basic scripting tasks,**\nincluding file manipulation, data selection, regular expressions, and multiprocessing,\nto potentially automate or optimize technical operations.\n\nSimilar to Salmon Typhoon’s LLM interactions, Microsoft observed engagement from\nForest Blizzard that were representative of an adversary exploring the use cases of a new\ntechnology. As with other adversaries, all accounts and assets associated with Forest\nBlizzard have been disabled.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Emerald Sleet\n\nEmerald Sleet (THALLIUM) is a North Korean threat actor that has remained highly active\nthroughout 2023. Their recent operations relied on spear-phishing emails to compromise\nand gather intelligence from prominent individuals with expertise on North Korea.\nMicrosoft observed Emerald Sleet impersonating reputable academic institutions and\nNGOs to lure victims into replying with expert insights and commentary about foreign\npolicies related to North Korea. Emerald Sleet overlaps with threat actors tracked by other\nresearchers as Kimsuky and Velvet Chollima.\n\nEmerald Sleet’s use of LLMs has been in support of this activity and involved research\ninto think tanks and experts on North Korea, as well as the generation of content likely to\nbe used in spear-phishing campaigns. Emerald Sleet also interacted with LLMs to\nunderstand publicly known vulnerabilities, to troubleshoot technical issues, and for\nassistance with using various web technologies. Based on these observations, we map\nand classify these TTPs using the following descriptions:\n\n**LLM-assisted vulnerability research: Interacting with LLMs to better understand**\npublicly reported vulnerabilities, such as the CVE-2022-30190 Microsoft Support\nDiagnostic Tool (MSDT) vulnerability (known as “Follina”).\n**LLM-enhanced scripting techniques: Using LLMs for basic scripting tasks such**\nas programmatically identifying certain user events on a system and seeking\nassistance with troubleshooting and understanding various web technologies.\n**LLM-supported social engineering: Using LLMs for assistance with the drafting**\nand generation of content that would likely be for use in spear-phishing campaigns\nagainst individuals with regional expertise.\n**LLM-informed reconnaissance: Interacting with LLMs to identify think tanks,**\ngovernment organizations, or experts on North Korea that have a focus on defense\nissues or North Korea’s nuclear weapon’s program.\n\nAll accounts and assets associated with Emerald Sleet have been disabled.\n\n## Crimson Sandstorm\n\nCrimson Sandstorm (CURIUM) is an Iranian threat actor assessed to be connected to the\nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Active since at least 2017, Crimson\nSandstorm has targeted multiple sectors, including defense, maritime shipping,\ntransportation, healthcare, and technology. These operations have frequently relied on\nwatering hole attacks and social engineering to deliver custom .NET malware. Prior\nresearch also identified custom Crimson Sandstorm malware using email-based\ncommand-and-control (C2) channels. Crimson Sandstorm overlaps with the threat actor\ntracked by other researchers as Tortoiseshell, Imperial Kitten, and Yellow Liderc.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe use of LLMs by Crimson Sandstorm has reflected the broader behaviors that the\nsecurity community has observed from this threat actor. Interactions have involved\nrequests for support around social engineering, assistance in troubleshooting errors,\n.NET development, and ways in which an attacker might evade detection when on a\ncompromised machine. Based on these observations, we map and classify these TTPs\nusing the following descriptions:\n\n**LLM-supported social engineering: Interacting with LLMs to generate various**\nphishing emails, including one pretending to come from an international\ndevelopment agency and another attempting to lure prominent feminists to an\nattacker-built website on feminism.\n**LLM-enhanced scripting techniques: Using LLMs to generate code snippets that**\nappear intended to support app and web development, interactions with remote\nservers, web scraping, executing tasks when users sign in, and sending information\nfrom a system via email.\n**LLM-enhanced anomaly detection evasion: Attempting to use LLMs for**\nassistance in developing code to evade detection, to learn how to disable antivirus\nvia registry or Windows policies, and to delete files in a directory after an application\nhas been closed.\n\nAll accounts and assets associated with Crimson Sandstorm have been disabled.\n\n## Charcoal Typhoon\n\nCharcoal Typhoon (CHROMIUM) is a Chinese state-affiliated threat actor with a broad\noperational scope. They are known for targeting sectors that include government, higher\neducation, communications infrastructure, oil & gas, and information technology. Their\nactivities have predominantly focused on entities within Taiwan, Thailand, Mongolia,\nMalaysia, France, and Nepal, with observed interests extending to institutions and\nindividuals globally who oppose China’s policies. Charcoal Typhoon overlaps with the\nthreat actor tracked by other researchers as Aquatic Panda, ControlX, RedHotel, and\nBRONZE UNIVERSITY.\n\nIn recent operations, Charcoal Typhoon has been observed interacting with LLMs in ways\nthat suggest a limited exploration of how LLMs can augment their technical operations.\nThis has consisted of using LLMs to support tooling development, scripting,\nunderstanding various commodity cybersecurity tools, and for generating content that\ncould be used to social engineer targets. Based on these observations, we map and\nclassify these TTPs using the following descriptions:\n\n**LLM-informed reconnaissance: Engaging LLMs to research and understand**\nspecific technologies, platforms, and vulnerabilities, indicative of preliminary\ninformation-gathering stages.\n**LLM-enhanced scripting techniques: Utilizing LLMs to generate and refine**\nscripts, potentially to streamline and automate complex cyber tasks and operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**LLM-supported social engineering: Leveraging LLMs for assistance with**\ntranslations and communication, likely to establish connections or manipulate\ntargets.\n**LLM-refined operational command techniques: Utilizing LLMs for advanced**\ncommands, deeper system access, and control representative of post-compromise\nbehavior.\n\nAll associated accounts and assets of Charcoal Typhoon have been disabled, reaffirming\nour commitment to safeguarding against the misuse of AI technologies.\n\n## Salmon Typhoon\n\nSalmon Typhoon (SODIUM) is a sophisticated Chinese state-affiliated threat actor with a\nhistory of targeting US defense contractors, government agencies, and entities within the\ncryptographic technology sector. This threat actor has demonstrated its capabilities\nthrough the deployment of malware, such as Win32/Wkysol, to maintain remote access to\ncompromised systems. With over a decade of operations marked by intermittent periods\nof dormancy and resurgence, Salmon Typhoon has recently shown renewed activity.\nSalmon Typhoon overlaps with the threat actor tracked by other researchers as APT4 and\nMaverick Panda.\n\nNotably, Salmon Typhoon’s interactions with LLMs throughout 2023 appear exploratory\nand suggest that this threat actor is evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in sourcing\ninformation on potentially sensitive topics, high profile individuals, regional geopolitics, US\ninfluence, and internal affairs. This tentative engagement with LLMs could reflect both a\nbroadening of their intelligence-gathering toolkit and an experimental phase in assessing\nthe capabilities of emerging technologies.\n\nBased on these observations, we map and classify these TTPs using the following\ndescriptions:\n\n**LLM-informed reconnaissance: Engaging LLMs for queries on a diverse array of**\nsubjects, such as global intelligence agencies, domestic concerns, notable\nindividuals, cybersecurity matters, topics of strategic interest, and various threat\nactors. These interactions mirror the use of a search engine for public domain\nresearch.\n**LLM-enhanced scripting techniques: Using LLMs to identify and resolve coding**\nerrors. Requests for support in developing code with potential malicious intent were\nobserved by Microsoft, and it was noted that the model adhered to established\nethical guidelines, declining to provide such assistance.\n**LLM-refined operational command techniques: Demonstrating an interest in**\nspecific file types and concealment tactics within operating systems, indicative of an\neffort to refine operational command execution.\n**LLM-aided technical translation and explanation: Leveraging LLMs for the**\ntranslation of computing terms and technical papers.\n\n\n-----\n\nSalmon Typhoon’s engagement with LLMs aligns with patterns observed by Microsoft,\nreflecting traditional behaviors in a new technological arena. In response, all accounts\nand assets associated with Salmon Typhoon have been disabled.\n\nIn closing, AI technologies will continue to evolve and be studied by various threat actors.\nMicrosoft will continue to track threat actors and malicious activity misusing LLMs, and\nwork with OpenAI and other partners to share intelligence, improve protections for\ncustomers and aid the broader security community.\n\n## Appendix: LLM-themed TTPs\n\nUsing insights from our analysis above, as well as other potential misuse of AI, we’re\n[sharing the below list of LLM-themed TTPs that we map and classify to the MITRE](https://attack.mitre.org/)\n[ATT&CK® framework or MITRE ATLAS™ knowledgebase to equip the community with a](https://attack.mitre.org/)\ncommon taxonomy to collectively track malicious use of LLMs and create\ncountermeasures against:\n\n**LLM-informed reconnaissance: Employing LLMs to gather actionable intelligence**\non technologies and potential vulnerabilities.\n**LLM-enhanced scripting techniques: Utilizing LLMs to generate or refine scripts**\nthat could be used in cyberattacks, or for basic scripting tasks such as\nprogrammatically identifying certain user events on a system and assistance with\ntroubleshooting and understanding various web technologies.\n**LLM-aided development: Utilizing LLMs in the development lifecycle of tools and**\nprograms, including those with malicious intent, such as malware.\n**LLM-supported social engineering: Leveraging LLMs for assistance with**\ntranslations and communication, likely to establish connections or manipulate\ntargets.\n**LLM-assisted vulnerability research: Using LLMs to understand and identify**\npotential vulnerabilities in software and systems, which could be targeted for\nexploitation.\n**LLM-optimized payload crafting: Using LLMs to assist in creating and refining**\npayloads for deployment in cyberattacks.\n**LLM-enhanced anomaly detection evasion: Leveraging LLMs to develop**\nmethods that help malicious activities blend in with normal behavior or traffic to\nevade detection systems.\n**LLM-directed security feature bypass: Using LLMs to find ways to circumvent**\nsecurity features, such as two-factor authentication, CAPTCHA, or other access\ncontrols.\n\n\n-----\n\n**LLM-advised resource development: Using LLMs in tool development, tool**\nmodifications, and strategic operational planning.\n\n\n-----",
