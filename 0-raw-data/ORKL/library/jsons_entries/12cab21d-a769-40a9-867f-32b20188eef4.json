Malware\nusing code signing certificate is classified as highly reliable software and is less likely to be\ndetected by Anti Virus (AV). It is known that attackers prefer code signed certificates as the\n\n\n-----\n\nmost of current Internet and security systems are oriented toward trust and reputation\ndependent models.\n\nCode signing certificates began to be sold on the dark web from around 2015 to 2016, and\nare mostly spotted on Russian speaking forums. Until recently, code signed certificates are\nbeing sold by various sellers on the forums and prices ranging from $400 to $3500\ndepending on the grade of the certificate.\n\nIt is important to consider the fact that this criminal ecosystem being active is that sellers\nhave been constantly supplying certificates of legitimate companies, which can be seen that\nthose of companies and developers’ lack of security awareness and negligence of\nmanagement provided the cause of hacking code signing certificates processing servers.\n\nMost of the code signing certificate issues had already been a big issue in the past, so many\npeople regard this issue as just an old case. However, attackers are still interested in code\nsigning certificate servers and still being traded on the dark web or via hidden channels.\n\n## Code signing certificate sales posting in the dark web\n\nAccording to the seller, it can issue a certificate of global brand C that issues SSL\ncertificates. And the price ranges from $500 to $2600.\n\nIf you develop a software without code signing, the biggest difference is in the User Account\nControl (UAC) part when executing the software.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage from SSL2BUY ()\n\n## CodeSigning vs SSL Certificate\n\nImage from SECTIGO store ()\nAs can be seen from above diagram, the main difference between SSL certificate and code\nsigning certificate is whether you own a website or you publish downloadable software,\napplications, etc.\n\nIf so, let’s have a look how the EV is different in the code signature.\n\n## Code Signing vs Code Signing EV\n\n\n-----\n\nThe code signing EV mentioned by seller means Extended Validation (EV) code signing\ncertificates, which differs from the general code signing certificate in that the private key is\nstored in a separate hardware token in the case of EV. The most noticeable difference when\nrunning the software is that the Windows Smart Screen Filter warning does not appear when\nusing EV code signing certificates.\n\nImage from Code Signing Store ()\nBecause of this, many cybercriminals use code signed certificate to increase the success\nrate of attacks when creating malwares.\n\nHowever, the certificate cannot be issued by anyone, it is required to submit documents such\nas business registration certificate, tax payment certificate, and etc. to authorities and go\nthrough examination process. Therefore, attackers directly steal the code sign certificate by\ncompromising legitimate company’s certification server, or purchase it from the dark web\nsellers.\n\nThen, let’s take a look at how many sellers are still active on the dark web forums.\n\n## Code Signing Certificate Sellers on the dark web\n\n\n-----\n\nAs can be seen from the table, users have been active from at least 2 months to 7 years. In\nthis regard, code signing certificates can be seen as quite a popular product on the dark\nweb.\n\n## Seller’s Posts in Exploit[.]iN Forum\n\n**Megatraffer**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nDigital certificates for sale, from the oldest and most trusted service!🎖We offer:regular (non-EV) code signing certificates- EV code signing certificatesPrice- non-EV\ncertificate - $700- EV code signing certificate - $3500All certificates:- valid for 1\nyear, can also make them for 2 yearsWhy signing files?- to avoid red/yellow UAC\nwarnings- to avoid SmartScreen alerts- signed software is much more trusted by userssome antiviruses block ALL unsigned software from being executedBenefits of EV Code\nSigning certificates- removes SmartScreen blue windows immediately- maximum level of\ntrust by AVs- EV certificate is a 'must have' if you want to sign drivers for Windows\n10Contact:***sanitized by s2wlabDouble-check contact details before sending money!\nBeware of scammers!\n\n## Seller’s Posts in XSS[.]IS Forum\n\n```\n**Firefox**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nThere is a ready-made C**** Code Signing certificate (standard), made for sale,\nreleased on 04/15/2019, valid for 1 year.Price: 350 $In the future, I am considering\nthe possibility of manufacturing the entire range of certificates from C***, both\nready-made and to order.When buying this product, you yourself must understand what\nit is for and how to use it.Also, along with the certificate, you can redeem the\nC**** account associated with it - in this case, the price is negotiated\nindividually.If there is a stable demand, we will gradually expand the range and\nvolumes.

As mentioned earlier, the\nreason why the criminal ecosystem is still active today is that there is an abundance of\nsupply chains in which hackers constantly bringing legitimate companies’ certificates.\n\nIt is difficult for general companies to cope with malicious code signed with legitimate\ncompanies certificates. Therefore, the most fundamental solution is to raise the security\nawareness of companies and developers for the code signing certificate server and manage\nthem in cautious manner.\n\n## References to past cases related to code signing certificates\n\n Case 1 : Private-Key Stolen\n\nStealing the private-key of a normal software developer, signing the malicious code they\ndeveloped, and disguised as a legitimate program\n\n**Case 1–1.
