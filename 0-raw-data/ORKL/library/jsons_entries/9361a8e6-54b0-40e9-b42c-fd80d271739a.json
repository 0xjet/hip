The\nreemerging Emotet malspam was already blocked by existing detection rules. The current\nEmotet malspam wave again uses malicious macro documents spread either via attachments\nor via malicious download links. As usual, the VBA macros in the document download the\nEmotet loader that the Hornetsecurity Security Lab has previously analyzed [EmotetLoader].\n\n## Background\n\nAs previous reported the return of Emotet was inevitable. The Emotet botnet did not send\nmalspam since 2020-02-07. While there were other activities on the botnet, as can be seen in\nthe following timeline, no malspam was observed by the Hornetsecurity Security Lab since\n2020-02-07.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn 2020-07-17 new Emotet malspam emails were blocked by Hornetsecurity’s email filtering\nsystems. One of such emails looks as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe email has a Word document attached, however, other emails with malicious download\nlinks to the malicious Word documents exist as well. When opening the document it instructs\nthe user to click the “Enable Editing” (or as the Emotet authors put it “Enable Edition”) and\nclick the “Enable Content” banner buttons:\n\nIf a user does so, they become a victim to Emotet.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nAs previously reported the typical Emotet infection chain is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nWe already reported on the Emotet loader as part of an analysis regarding its updates.\nBecause at that time Emotet did not send malspam we could not outline the malicious\ndocuments typically used in Emotet infections.\n\nThe VBA macros are obfuscated. The macro will construct a Powershell command from\nobfuscated strings embedded in the VBA macro:\n\nDecoding the Base64-encoded command reveals the 5 Emotet loader download URLs:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe document will try to download the Emotet loader from each of these 5 URLs:\n\nIn case one of the 5 downlods is successful, it executes the Emotet loader, which we\npreviously analyzed in a different article [EmotetLoader].\n\n## Conclusion and Countermeasure\n\nUnlike previously speculated Emotet has no new tricks – at least not when it comes to the\nmalspam.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo protect against Emotet the US CERT recommends to implement filters at the email\ngateway to filter out emails with known malspam indicators” [USCERT].\n\nHornetsecurity’s [Spam Filter and Malware Protection, with the highest detection rates on the](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/services/spam-filter/)\nmarket, already detected and blocked the reemerged Emotet malspam. Hornetsecurity’s\n[Advanced Threat Protection extends this protection by also detecting yet unknown threats.](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/services/advanced-threat-protection/)\n\nBeyond blocking the incoming Emotet emails defenders can use public available information\nby the Cryptolaemus team, a voluntary group of IT security people banding together to fight\nEmotet. They provide new information daily via their website [CryptolaemusWeb]. There you\ncan obtain the latest C2 IP list for finding and/or blocking C2 traffic. For real-time updates you\ncan follow their Twitter account [CryptolaemusTwitter].\n\n## References\n\n[EmotetLoader] https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/security-information/awaiting-theinevitable-return-of-emotet/\n\n[USCERT] [https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-201A](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-201A)\n\n[Cryptolaemus] [https://paste.cryptolaemus.com/](https://paste.cryptolaemus.com/)\n\n[CryptolaemusTwitter] [https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1](https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n### Hashes\n\n**SHA256** **Description**\n\n`99d8438c947cac7ca363037f1436ecab4e7fa4609c9c59f6fd5006a050d361aa` Malicious\ndocument\n\n`5d2c6110f2ea87a6b7fe9256affbac0eebdeee18081d59e05df4b4a17417492b` Malicious\ndocument\n\n`c5949244e5d529848c2323545a75eec34e6ba33c6519d46359b004d6717a68a5` Malicious\ndocument\n\n### URLs\n```\n   hxxps[:]//www.elseelektrikci[.]com/wp-content/hedk3/\n   hxxps[:]//www.rviradeals[.]com/wp-includes/LeDR/\n   hxxps[:]//skenglish[.]com/wp-admin/o0gf/\n   hxxps[:]//www.packersmoversmohali[.]com/wp-includes/pgmt4x/\n   hxxps[:]//www.tri-comma[.]com/wp-admin/MmD/\n\n DNSs\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nwww.elseelektrikci[.]com\n\n```\n\n-----",
