We cannot confirm if these other groups were\ndirectly targeted. These news websites report on issues sensitive to the government of China and are blocked\nin the country. However, this report does not conclusively attribute the campaign to a publicly reported threat\nactor or state sponsor.\n\nThe malware operation made efforts to evade detection and frustrate analysis. The operation combined\nobfuscated, packed executables and custom shellcode with an additional step of using compromised servers\nto host the malicious payload. We identify the payload as NetWire, a commodity remote access trojan\ntypically seen used in cybercrime activities and not commonly observed in Asia.\n\nWe connect the infrastructure used in the campaign to previous malware operations targeting a Tibetan radio\nstation and the Thai government. We also connect one of the code signing certificates we observed to a\ncampaign targeting gaming companies. It is notable that NetWire was also used as a payload in that\ncampaign.\n\n## Summary\n\nA journalist at [China Digital Times (CDT), (an independent Chinese and English language news portal), receives an](http://chinadigitaltimes.net/)\nemail from a source claiming to have a tip on a sensitive story: “I have insider information that is different from what\nyou’ve published”. The email includes a link to an article from the news portal. Clicking on the link displays the article\nwith a pop-up message asking the journalist to enter their username and password in prompt designed to look like a\nWordPress login page. What is normally a routine interaction for the journalist has become increasingly threatening.\nThe tip from the source is actually an attempt to steal the journalist’s WordPress credentials used to manage and\npublish content to the news portal.\n\nThe rouse used in the phishing email was clever, but it did not work. The journalist was immediately suspicious of\nthe phishing attempts and shared them with researchers at the Citizen Lab to analyze, which led to the discovery of\na wider campaign targeting Chinese language news sites using various tactics including reconnaissance, phishing,\n[and malware. The campaign used domains and copied content that masqueraded as Epoch Times, Mingjing](http://www.theepochtimes.com/)\n[News, HK01, and Bowen Press. It is not clear if these other news groups were directly targeted. These](https://www.hk01.com/)\norganizations often report on issues that are politically sensitive to the government of China and their websites are\nblocked in the country. Our analysis of the infrastructure used in this campaign reveals connections to previous\nmalware operations targeting Tibetan journalists and the Thai government. These incidents includes targets that are\ngenerally within the geopolitical interest of the government of China. However, this report does not conclusively\nattribute the campaign to a publicly reported threat actor or state sponsor.\n\n\n-----\n\n[had infiltrated the mail servers of Associated Press offices in London and Hong Kong. Another investigation in 2009,](https://www.nartv.org/2009/09/28/targeted-malware-attack-on-foreign-correspondent%E2%80%99s-based-in-china/)\nby Nart Villeneuve and Greg Walton uncovered a targeted malware campaign against China-based journalists\nworking at Reuters, the Straits Times, Dow Jones, Agence France Presse, and Ansa. In recent years other major\n[news organizations, including the The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post, have](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/technology/chinese-hackers-infiltrate-new-york-times-computers.html)\nreported intrusions of their networks and systems by China-based operators. In each incident, the operators were\nsuspected to be sponsored by the government of China with the motivation of gathering information on Chinarelated reporting that the newspapers were covering.\n\nThese historical incidents and the campaign we analyze in this report serve as a general reminder that the media\nare targets for digital espionage and, as a result, news organizations and journalists need to reflect on their business\npractices and behaviours and adopt a more systematic approach to information security.\n\nThis report proceeds in five parts outlined below:\n\n**Part 1: Phishing Operation Targeting China Digital Times**\n\nThis section describes phishing messages sent to China Digital Times and our subsequent investigation into the\ntactics and server infrastructure used in the operation.\n\n**Part 2: Uncovering a Wider Campaign**\n\nThis section reveals how the operation against China Digital Times was part of a wider campaign of phishing,\nreconnaissance, and malware operations that used domains and content made to mimic four other Chineselanguage news organizations, Epoch Times, Mingjing News, HK01, and Bowen Press.\n\n**Part 3: Malware Operation**\n\nThis section describes a malware operation that used content and domains made to mimic Chinese-language news\norganizations HK01 and Bowen Press. The malware operation made efforts to evade detection and frustrate\nanalysis. The operation combined obfuscated, packed executables and custom shellcode with an additional step of\nusing compromised servers to host the malicious payload. We identify the payload as NetWire, a commodity remote\naccess trojan that is not commonly observed in Asia and typically seen used in cybercrime activities.\n\n**Part 4: Campaign Connections**\n\nThis section links infrastructure used in the campaign against Chinese-language news site to previous malware\ncampaigns targeting a Tibetan radio station and the Thai government. It also shows the same certificate information\nused to sign the malware in this campaign was used by other malware operations targeting gaming companies.\n\n**Part 5: Discussion and Conclusions**\n\nThis section summarizes the characteristics of the campaign and how it reflects wider information security\nchallenges for news organizations and journalists.\n\n## Part 1: Phishing Operation Targeting China Digital Times\n\n_This section describes a phishing messages sent to China Digital Times and our subsequent investigation into the_\n_tactics and server infrastructure used in the operation._\n\n### A Suspicious Tip: “I Have Insider Information”\n\n\n-----\n\n[California, Berkeley who has been engaged in human rights activism since the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre.](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/interviews/xiao.html)\n\nOn February 12, 2017, a CDT staff member received an email from a person claiming to be a UC Berkeley student\nwith “insider information” on claims made by 郭云贵 (Guo Yungui) on “hacker attacks” against the Chinese language\n[news site Mingjing News. The characters 郭云贵 (Guo Yungui) appears to be a slight variation of Guo Wengui (郭文](http://m.weekly.caixin.com/m/2015-03-27/100795235.html)\n[贵), a Chinese billionaire who has gained notoriety after voicing allegations that high ranking officials in the](https://globalvoices.org/2017/06/05/exiled-tycoons-corruption-expose-rattles-chinas-politics/)\n[Communist Party of China are engaged in corruption. In January 2017 he had an interview with Mingjing News in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjF6UWVvfmQ)\nwhich he made further unconfirmed allegations regarding official corruption and abuse. Following this interview, the\n[editor of Minjing News, claimed “several sites and channels of Mingjing were attacked by vicious groups controlled](http://cn.rfi.fr/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD/20170212-%E6%98%8E%E9%95%9C%E7%94%B5%E8%A7%86%E7%9B%B4%E6%92%AD%E9%83%AD%E6%96%87%E8%B4%B5%EF%BC%8C%E6%8B%89%E5%BC%80%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E6%94%BF%E6%B2%BB%E5%A4%A7%E6%88%8F)\nby corrupt parties.”\n\nThe email sent to CDT included a link that directly referenced an IP address rather than a domain name. The staff\nmember was immediately suspicious and did not click on the link (see below):\n\n**Original Email Text**\nFrom: papa papa hellomice@mail.com\nDate: February 13 2017\nSubject: 我是伯克利加州大学的学生，我想认识一下您,我有爆\n料\nTo: [REDACTED] 我想向您爆料，关于郭云贵说中国黑客攻击明镜\n具体内幕，hXXp://43.240.14.37/asdasdasadqddd12222111[.]php/article.asp=search.php\n\n**English Translation**\nFrom: papa papa hellomice@gmail.com\nDate: February 13 2017\nSubject: I am a student of UC Berkeley.

This\nemail included a link that, at first glance, appeared to be the domain of China Digital Times, but with a slight\nmisspelling. Instead of chinadigitaltimes.net the link sent was chinadagitaltimes[.]net with an added ‘a’\ninstead of an ‘i’ in the word digital. A day after this email was sent, other staff members at CDT received similar\nemails with the same link (see below).\n\n**Original Email Text**\nFrom: sda daaa\n<aisia.anminda8@mail.com>\nDate: February 14 2017\nSubject: 您好，我想向您爆料相关内幕\nTo: [REDACTED] 您好：\n我有关于中国时代日报上的一篇文章最新的消息，中国黑客攻击的后续事件以及最近明镜网被攻击的内幕信息\n文章地址:hXXp://www.chinadagitaltimes[.]net/2016/07/chinese-hackers-blamed-multiple-breaches-fdic/文中写的与\n我这边得到的消息有些差异点\n\n**English Translation**\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom: sda daaa <aisia.anminda8@mail.com>\nDate: February 14 2017\nSubject: hi, I'd like to offer you some insider\ninformation.\nTo: [REDACTED] I have the latest information on an\narticle published by China Daily. It’s about follow-ups on the incident of Chinese hackers and some insider\ninformation on the recent attacks against Mingjing News.\nLink to the article.\nhXXp://www.chinadagitaltimes[.]net/2016/07/chinese-hackers-blamed-multiple-breaches-fdic/The information\npresented in the article is slightly different from the information I know.\n\nThe link connects to a web page that mirrors content from the real CDT website displaying an article related to\nhacker groups from China (see Figure 1 for comparison of the real and fake content).\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the real and fake CDT webpages.\n\nVisually, the content is identical. The only substantive difference between the real and fake content is a few lines of\njavascript code (see Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2: Snippet of Javascript code in the source of the fake China Digital Times webpage.\n\nThe function of this code is to pop a window on the screen that says “您的登录已失效,请重新登录!” [Your login has\nexpired, please log in again!] (see Figure 3).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Screenshot of the fake China Digital Times webpage and the popup message displayed.\n\nIf the OK button is clicked, the user is forwarded to what appears to be a WordPress login page (see **Figure 4).**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Fake WordPress Login page\n\nCredentials entered into this page are sent to the operators. Following entry of credentials, users are forwarded to\nthe real CDT site. The real CDT website runs on WordPress, and therefore the purpose of this phishing campaign is\nto steal credentials to the actual CDT website and gain access. The operators customized a fake domain to host real\ncontent and developed custom phishing pages for stealing the WordPress credentials demonstrating a substantial\nlevel of effort.\n\n### Phishing Operation Timeline\n\nThrough analysis of the server used to host the phishing pages and the phishing emails sent to CDT we\ndocumented the activities and timeline of the operation, which lasted for approximately 20 days (see Figure 5). The\noperation began with the operators scanning the real CDT website for vulnerabilities. Five days later the first\nphishing email was sent. The next day the operators registered the domain mimicking the CDT site, set up the fake\nsite, and sent out phishing emails with links to it. Over the next week further phishing emails were sent to CDT.\nThrough analysis of log files found on the server we observed what appears to be the operators testing the phishing\npage during this period. The last phishing email sent to CDT was on February 20. Eight days later the fake CDT\nwebsite was taken down and no further phishing emails were sent.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Timeline of the phishing operation targeting China Digital Times\n\n### Reconnaissance and phishing server\n\nThis section provides analysis of the server used for reconnaissance and phishing activities. We find fake domains\nand content related to China Digital Times and Mingjing News on this server.\n\nThe links sent in the emails to CDT are both on the same IP address: 43[.]240[.]14[.]37, hosted by Cloudie, a\nhosting provider based in Hong Kong. The link provided in the first phishing email sent to CDT included the full IP\naddress of the server.\n\nhXXp://43.240.14.37/asdasdasadqddd12222111[.]php/article.asp=search.php\n\nFour days after the first phishing email was sent to CDT we accessed the content on the page and found it served\n[content copied from a Mingjing News article about illicit sales of Chinese visas (See Figure 6 for comparison of the](http://www.mingjingnews.com/TV/video/V000013942)\nreal and fake content).\n\nFigure 6: Comparison of the real and fake Mingjing news site\n\nTh f k did t d tl d i i t t hi h b d t i i i f th\n\n\n-----\n\nComparing the legitimate page to the fake page finds no addition of code by the operator on the fake page.\n\n#### Reconnaissance Server Log Analysis\n\nWe investigated the directory of the fake Minjing News page and found the content was\nmodified on February 14, 2017 and discovered a file ‘log.txt’. This file is a custom log that captures three\npieces of information from every visitor to the page: IP address, web browser user agent, and time visited (see\n**Figure 7). There is no malicious content on the page. We suspect that the purpose of this page is to perform**\nreconnaissance of targets by testing if users will click on the link, and by retrieving IP addresses and user agent\ninformation.\n\nFigure 7: Server directory containing the log.txt file.\n\nThe first visit in the log file is on February 2, 2017 from the IP address 45[.]124[.]24[.]39 which is also hosted\non Cloudie. This visit is likely from the operators because it was the first visit and from the same provider on which\nthe server is hosted. There are also two visits in the logs within seconds of each other, from the IP address\n125[.]86[.]123[.]47 (ChinaNet, Chongqing China)\n\nExamining the email headers from the phishing emails reveals two IP addresses, including the same Cloudie IP and\nanother ChinaNet Chongqing IP (see below):\n\n45[.]124[.]24[.]39 Cloudie HK\n141[.]08[.]99[.]155: ChinaNet\nChongqing\n\nWe shared these IP addresses with CDT to check if the addresses had visited the real CDT website around the\nperiod of the phishing emails. We found that the Cloudie IP address (45[.]124[.]24[.]39) visited the real CDT\nweb site 42,000 times on February 8 2017, during a four hour period. The rate of the requests, user agents utilized,\nand information requested indicates that these visits were attempts to enumerate HTTP paths on the website to test\nfor vulnerabilities. This scan occurred less than a week before the operators staged the phishing page sent to CDT.\n\n#### Phishing Server Log Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nthe CDT homepage (see Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8: Comparison of the real frontpage of CDT (as seen on day the emails were sent) and the fake\nwebpage\n\nThis fake homepage was not included in the emails sent to CDT. The operators potentially included this homepage if\nusers clicked the link in the email and then viewed the top level URL to ensure they were on the right site (see\nbelow).\n\nEmail Link:\nchinadagitaltimes[.]net/2016/07/chinese-hackers-blamed-multiple-breaches-fdic\nHome page: chinadagitaltimes[.]net\n\nThe directory of chinadagitaltimes[.]net/2016/07 shows the content listed on the server and lists the last\nmodified date of the content as February 15, 2017 (see Figure 9).\n\nFigure 9: An index listing on the phishing server.\n\nWe found a file ‘log.txt’ on the fake CDT home page and article web pages. This log file records the IP address,\nbrowser user agent, and timestamp of visitors to the pages. We found an additional log in the URL of the fake\n\n\n-----\n\nunsuccessful. The first entry on February 16, 2017 may be a record of the operator testing the phishing page.\n\nusername:1111----password:1111----2017-02-16\n09:26:14\n\nOn February 28, we again see what appear to be test credentials added.\n\nusername:12312----password:1232131----2017-02-28\n10:25:33\n\n### Phishing Operation Final Stages\n\nOn February 20, the CDT staff member who received the original phishing email was sent a follow-up email that\nresponded to an auto away message from the staff member and reminded the recipient about the link that was sent.\nThis was the last phishing email sent to CDT (see below):\n\n**Original Email Text**\nFrom: papa papa hellomice@mail.com\nTo: [REDACTED]\nDate: February 20 2017\nSubject: Fwd: 我是伯克利加州大学的学生，我想认识一下您,我有爆\n料 [REDACTED]您好:\n我想发一篇文章，该如何注册与登录:) thx\nSent: February 14 2017\nFrom: [REDACTED]\nTo: \"papa papa\"hellomice@mail.com\nSubject: Re: 我是伯克利加州大学的学生，我想认识一下您,我有爆料\n谢谢来信。非常抱歉我本月20号之前都没有时间，请月底和我再联系。谢谢。\n2017-02-13 18:34 GMT-08:00 papa papa hellomice@mail.com\n我想向您爆料，关于郭云贵说中国黑客攻击明镜具体内\n幕，hXXp://43.240.14.37/asdasdasadqddd12222111[.]php/article.asp=search.php\n\n**English Translation**\n\nFrom: papa papa hellomice@mail.com\nTo: [REDACTED]\nDate: February 20 2017\nSubject: Fwd: I am a student at UC Berkeley.

After the site was\ntaken down on February 28 no additional phishing emails were sent and we observed no other activity.\n\nAnalysis of passive DNS records and WHOIS registration information associated with the server infrastructure used\nto host the fake CDT page led to the discovery that the phishing operation targeting CDT was part of a wider\ncampaign.\n\n## Part 2: Uncovering a Wider Campaign\n\n_This section reveals how the operation against China Digital Times was part of a wider campaign of phishing,_\n_reconnaissance, and malware operations that used domains and content made to mimic four other Chinese_\n_language news organizations._\n\n### Infrastructure Connections\n\nAfter examining the server used to host the fake CDT page and referencing passive DNS records and WHOIS\nregistration information, we found other fake domains registered by the same entity with copied content from\nChinese-language news sites. Our analysis shows that the operators are using the fake domains for at least three\ndifferent purposes: reconnaissance, phishing, and malware. We were only able to collect phishing emails sent to\nCDT and cannot confirm if the other media organizations were direct targets or if the fake domains were used to\ntarget other groups. Table 1 provides an overview of groups that the operator attempted to mimic through fake\ndomains and / or copied content.\n\n\n**Site contents**\n\n**copied**\n\n\n**Confirmed**\n\n**targeting** **Purpose**\n\n\n**Organization**\n\nChina Digital\nTimes\n\n\n**Fake Domain**\n\n**Registered**\n\n\nX X X Phishing\n\n\nMingjing News X Recon\n\nHK01 X Malware\n\nBowen Press X X Unknown\n\nEpoch Times X Unknown\n\nThe fake domains are linked by common WHOIS registration information, which shows they were all registered by\nthe same entity. The WHOIS registration information used to register the fake CDT domain is as follows:\n\nName: free tibet\nMailing Address: Uniter states, Phoenix Arizona 86303\nUS\nPhone: +1.2126881188\nEmail: aobama_5@yahoo.com\n\nWe found a series of domains registered with the same information. The majority of these domains are designed to\nmimic domains of Chinese-language news sites. We resolved each domain to determine if they are active and which\nIP they resolve to (see Table 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Domain** **Date** **Real Organization** **March 15th)**\n\nsecuerserver[.]com 2015-08-31 GoDaddy (secureserver.com) Not resolving\n\n\nbowenpres[.]com 2015-10-07 Bowen Press\n(bowenpress.com)\n\nbowenpress[.]net 2015-10-07 Bowen Press\n(bowenpress.com)\n\nbowenpress[.]org 2015-10-07 Bowen Press\n(bowenpress.com)\n\nbowenpross[.]com 2015-10-07 Bowen Press\n(bowenpress.com)\n\n\nParked Page (GoDaddy)\n\nParked Page (GoDaddy)\n\nParked Page (GoDaddy)\n\nParked Page (GoDaddy)\n\n\ndatalink[.]one 2016-07-07 n/a Gorillaservers\n\n\nchinadagitaltimes[.]net 2017-02-14 China Digital Times\n(chinadigitaltimes.net)\n\nepochatimes[.]com 2017-02-27 Epoch Times\n(theepochtimes.com)\n\n\nCloudie HK\n\nCloudie HK\n\n\nThe registration dates show the operators have been registering fake domains that mimic Chinese language news\nwebsites since 2015, when they registered domains made to look like the real domain of news site Bowen Press (\nbowenpress[.]com).\n\nWe investigated the servers hosting the domains and found the operators use two servers for different purposes:\none for phishing and reconnaissance activities and another to serve malware.\n\nThe phishing and reconnaissance server hosted the fake CDT domain, the fake Mingjing page, and a domain made\nto look like the legitimate domain of Epoch Times (a multilingual media organization started by Chinese-American\nFalun Gong supporters.\n\nOn February 26 2017, the operators registered a fake domain mimicking the main Epoch Times domain\n(epochtimes[.]com), which adds an additional ‘a’ after ‘epoch’ ( epochatimes[.]com).\n\nFollowing our discovery of the fake Epoch Times domain we notified the organization and shared indicators of\ncompromise. Epoch Times found a Cloudie IP (103.200.31[.]164) that sent 24,183 requests during a 12 hour\nperiod on March 8, 2017 to the subscription page of Epoch Times at the URL subscribe.epochtimes.com.\nThese requests appear to be attempts to enumerate HTTP paths, similar to the requests sent to China Digital Times\non February 8.\n\nGiven the timeframe of the registration of the fake Epoch Times domain, we suspect the operators may have moved\nfrom targeting CDT to Epoch Times. The fake Epoch Times domain was hosted on the same server as the fake CDT\nand Mingjing pages (43.240.14[.]37). However, we did not find content copied from any Epoch Times websites\non the operator’s infrastructure during the investigation and did not have any phishing emails reported to us. It is\npossible that the fake Epoch Times domain is being used for phishing or reconnaissance, but we are unable to\nconfirm.\n\nIn addition to phishing and reconnaissance activities the operators are also engaged in malware operations and\nhave a dedicated server for this purpose. We discovered the malware server by resolving the domain:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Part 3: Malware Operation\n\n_This section describes a malware operation that used content and domains made to mimic Chinese-language news_\n_organizations HK01 and Bowen Press. The malware operation made efforts to evade detection and frustrate_\n_analysis. The operation combined obfuscated, packed executables, and custom shellcode with an additional step of_\n_using compromised servers to host the malicious payload. We identify the payload as NetWire, a commodity remote_\n_access trojan that is not commonly observed in Asia and typically seen used in cybercrime activities._\n\n### Malware server and analysis\n\nOur investigation of the malware operation began with analysis of the server used to host the malware. The malware\nserver is on the IP address: 23[.]239[.]106[.]119 hosted by GorillaServers, a provider based in the United\nStates. We found the server by resolving the domain datalink[.]one, which was one of the domains registered by the\noperators.\n\nOn the server we found domains and copied content mimicking HK01 and Bowen Press, but cannot confirm if these\ngroups were direct targets of the malware operation or if the content was used as lures to target other groups.\n\nPassive DNS records for the IP address: 23[.]239[.]106[.]119 show a number of other domains that we have\nconnected to the operators including:\n\n**Domains**\n\ndatalink[.]one\n\nget.adobe.com.bowenpress[.]org\n\nhk.secuerserver[.]com\n\npop.secuerserver[.]com\n\nsmtpout.secuerserver[.]com\n\nwww.bowenpress[.]org\n\nwww.mail.secuerserver[.]com\n\nwww.secuerserver[.]com\n\nwww.vnews[.]hk\n\nWe found that some of these domains were used as command and control servers for the malware we found hosted\non the domain.\n\n#### HK01 Lure\n\nWhen we first investigated the malware server on March 6, 2017 we found it was hosting what appears to be a copy\nof the frontpage of HK01, a Hong Kong-based news site (see Figure 10).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: Comparison of real and fake HK01 webpages\n\nThe copied version of the HK01 site is missing the centre content displayed on the real site.\nInstead it shows a link with the following text: “Adobe Flash Player 版本過低，請點擊” [Adobe Flash Player this\nversion is outdated. Please click].\n\nThe link connects to:\nhXXp://get.adobe.com.bowenpress.org/Adobe/update/20161201/AdobeUpdate[.]html\n\nClicking this link initiates a download of an executable and then forwards the user to the legitimate Adobe update\nsite. These action are done through the following HTML code:\n\nWe browsed the directory of 23[.]1239[.]1106[.]119/adobe/update and found three different sub\ndirectories that each served three different executables (see Figure 11). A fourth sub directory and fourth executable\nappeared on March 12, 2017. Analysis of these executables shows they are malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: Server directory containing malicious executables.\n\n### Malware Analysis\n\nThe malicious binaries combined obfuscated, packed executables, and custom shellcode with an additional step of\nusing compromised servers to host the malicious payload. We identify the final payload as NetWire, a commodity\nremote access trojan that is not commonly observed in Asia and typically seen used in cybercrime activities.\n\nThe four executables we found in the “Adobe update” directory are named to appear as an update for Adobe Flash\nfollowed by a date stamp (e.g., AdobeUpdate20160703.exe).\n\nEach malware file was digitally signed:\n\n**File** **Certificate Details**\n\nAdobeUpdate20160703.exe 无锡凯扬电子科技有限公司\n\n**Serial: 57 be 1a 00 d2 e5 9b db d1 95 24 aa a1 7e d9 3b**\n\n**Valid From: Thursday, November 19, 2015 5:45:01 PM**\n\n**Valid To: Saturday, November 19, 2016 5:45:01 PM**\n\nAdobeUpdate20160812.exe 深圳市乐途儿科技有限公司\n\n**Serial: 68 be c5 c0 26 4c c9 09 6d 2f b2 0a 98 86 e9 4d**\n\n**Valid From: Monday, June 15, 2015 4:00:00 PM**\n\n**Valid To: Thursday, June 15, 2017 3:59:59 PM**\n\n\n-----\n\nAdobeUpdate20161201.exe\n\nAdobeUpdate20170312.exe\n\n\nElex do Brasil Participações Ltda\n\n**Serial: 06 71 ee 52 6a cb 6f 9b e2 01 f5 a8 e2 03 c4 1c**\n\n**Valid From: Sunday, April 12, 2015 4:00:00 PM**\n\n**Valid To: Wednesday, July 12, 2017 3:59:59 PM**\n\n\n[All four samples are packed with VMProtect, software used to obfuscate source code to make anaylsis and reverse](http://vmpsoft.com/)\nengineering more difficult. When executed the samples unpack and drop a second VMProtect-packed DLL to the\nfollowing location:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft\nShared\\VGX\\Stub.dll\n\nBefore executing the dropped DLL via rundll32 as shown:\n\nrundll32.exe C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft\nShared\\VGX\\Stub.dll,Install\n\nCOM+ Event\n\nThis stub DLL unpacks itself and then gains persistence by creating a new autorun service: Log . The\n\nDLL edits the following registry keys to create this new service:\n\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\nNT\\CurrentVersion\\SvcHost\\EventSystemLog\nHKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventSystemLog\nHKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet002\\Services\\EventSystemLog\nHKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet003\\Services\\EventSystemLog\n\nOnce the DLL has gained persistence it starts the newly created service. When run as part of a service, the DLL\nunpacks itself and attempts to download what appears to be a jpg file hosted on one of three websites: a Chineselanguage news organization, a University, and a software company.\n\nEach of the 4 samples uses a different URL. Each of these files begins with a 631 byte jpg header followed by\nencrypted shellcode. The malware first decrypts the payload immediately after the jpg header using the following\nalgorithm:\n\nfor i = 0; i < len(payload); i++ payload[i] = (16 * ~((((payload[i] ^ 0x50) >> 4) ^\ni) & 0xf) & 0xef) ^ payload[i]\n\nThe decrypted payload begins with a short header consisting of an unsigned 32 bit integer that is the size of the\nstage 2 payload, an unsigned 32 bit integer used as a checksum, and 64 bytes of padding. This header is followed\nby a block of shellcode and a second encrypted payload (see Figure 12). The shellcode decrypts the stage 2\npayload using RC4 with different 256-bit keys for each sample.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: Hex code showing jpg header followed by encrypted shellcode\n\n[This decrypted data contains additional shellcode followed by a PE file. We identify the PE file as the Netwire RAT.](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/netwire-rat-steals-payment-card-data)\nThe final stage shellcode acts as a loader and maps the RAT into memory and resolves the RAT’s imports before\njumping to the RAT’s entrypoint.\n\nNetwire RAT is a multi-platform RAT (Remote Access Tool) that first appeared in 2012. Since its appearance,\n[Netwire RAT has been used in a variety of attacks ranging from stealing credit card data to targeted campaigns](https://threatpost.com/netwire-rat-back-stealing-payment-card-data/122156/)\nagainst health care and banking sectors. The Netwire samples we analyzed are capable of a wide-range of behavior\nincluding:\n\nReading stored usernames and passwords from common apps including:\n\nWeb Browsers\n\n\n-----\n\nKeylogging\n\nTaking Screenshots\n\nAudio capture\n\nScreen recording\n\nProcess listing, creation, killing, etc.\n\nUploading and downloading files\n\nEach of the 4 fake jpg files contains a Netwire sample containing different configuration settings. After analyzing\nthe samples we recovered the configuration settings for each sample (see Appendix A). The use of multiple layers\nof packed or obfuscated payloads is likely an attempt to evade detection and analysis. Downloading the RAT each\ntime the malware runs could be an attempt to hide the final payload, as the Netwire samples are never written to\ndisk. This process makes direct analysis difficult without memory images or an understanding of the payload\ndecryption and shellcode routines to decrypt the RAT manually. Using different configurations for each sample could\nbe an attempt to use specific domains tailored to each target, or to allow for the use of multiple domains as fallbacks\nin case previously used domains are discovered and blocked.\n\nEach of the four binary samples we analyzed downloaded a copy of the Netwire RAT as a different “ jpg” file. The\nthree hosts used are all legitimate servers with active web pages. In each case, the jpg downloaded by the\nmalware is noticeably larger than other files in the same directory on the server and was last modified more\nrecently. We believe that each of the three servers used to host the “jpg” files have been compromised and that the\noperator is using these legitimate servers to host their payload in an effort to hide their activities.\n\nLike the phishing operation, the malware setup shows a significant level of effort. We observe custom shellcode\npaired with an additional step of using likely-compromised servers to host the payload. While Netwire has been seen\nin some targeted intrusions, it has primarily been used in cybercrime activities and is not common in Asia.\n\n### Bowen Press Lures\n\nThe earliest domains registered by the operators that follow the pattern of mimicking China related news\norganizations were decoys for Bowen Press. The real Bowen Press domain is bowenpress[.]com, the operators\nregistered bowenpress[.]org. We were unable to retrieve the content that originally appeared on the domains in\n2015. However, we were able to find copied Bowen Press content on the malware server through Google searches\non the “news” subdirectory of the server. The content was an iframe of the front page of Bowen Press and results in\nrendering additional error messages (See Figure 13). The existence of Bowen Press content on this server\nsuggests that the operators may have been using Bowen Press lures to serve malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13: Comparison of real and fake Bowen Press webpages\n\nAdditionally,we found the Netwire samples in a directory under the URL\nwww.bowenpress[.]org/Adobe/update, even though the website serving the sample was a copy of HK01. The\nuse of this URL path further suggests that the fake Bowen Press domain and content were used to serve malware at\nsome point. The operators may have simply reused the domain for the HK01 related campaign.\n\nOn March 15, 2017, the front page of the malware server was changed to a copy of the Bowen Press website that\nmirrored content from the same day (see Figure 14). The copied page did not contain any malicious code and we\nwere unable to find a log.txt file on the server.\n\n\n-----\n\nPress.\n\nThe only change to the content of the page was the removal of a bot check supplied by WordFence, a security\nplugin for the WordPress blogging platform. On March 21, the content was removed and the server returned a blank\npage.\n\nWe cannot confirm what was the purpose of the recently copied Bowen Press content. However, it shows that the\noperators have had a continued interest in using Bowen Press content as lures potentially to serve malware.\n\n## Part 4: Campaign Connections\n\n_This section links infrastructure used in the campaign against the Chinese-language news sites to previous malware_\n_campaigns targeting a Tibetan Radio Station and the Thai government. It also highlights connections between_\n_certificate information used to sign the Netwire samples we analyzed and malware used in campaigns targeting_\n_gaming companies._\n\n### Infrastructure Connections to Malware Operations against Tibetan Radio Station\n\nDomain registration information for some of the infrastructure used in the campaign have links to earlier targeted\nmalware operations against civil society and government groups in Asia.\n\nThe WHOIS records for the domains used in the phishing and malware operations include the phone number (\n12126881188). Searching other WHOIS records for this number reveals a known command and control server with\na Tibet theme. The WHOIS information for this domain matches all the fields with the exception of the email\naddress. All other fields used match including the same address and misspelling of United States as ‘Uniter States’.\n\nDomain: www.tibetonline[.]info\nName: free tibet\nMailing Address: Uniter states, Phoenix Arizona 86303\nUS\nPhone: +1.2126881188\nEmail: rooterit@outlook.com (admin)\nfightfortibet@ymail.com (billing)\n\nThe registrant e-mail is linked to another domain in addition to tibetonline[.]info which is rooter[.]tk.\nBoth these domains are linked to a 2013 campaign targeting Voice of Tibet, an independent radio station reporting\n[on Tibetan issues. In this campaign, the two domains were reported by ThreatConnect as being used as a](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/threatconnect-gets-root-targeted-exploitation-campaigns/)\ncommand and control server (rooter[.]tk) and hosting an Adobe Flash heap spray vulnerability (\ntibetonline[.]info) as well as an IE exploit (CVE-2013-1347).\n\n### Infrastructure Connections to Malware Operations against Thai Government\n\n[The domain tibetonline[.]info was also identified by Palo Alto Networks as a command and control server](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/11/attack-campaign-on-the-government-of-thailand-delivers-bookworm-trojan/)\n[used for FFRAT malware recently described by Cylance. This infrastructure overlapped with servers used by a](https://www.cylance.com/en_us/blog/breaking-down-ff-rat-malware.html)\nthreat actor targeting Thai government entities with the Bookworm trojan in 2015. The general tactics, techniques,\nand procedures used by this threat actor also show similarities to the campaign we analysed. Both used the same\nhosting provider on one IP: Cloudie HK (103.226.127[.]47), and used fake Adobe updates to lure targets into\ninstalling malware. The threat actor documented by Palo Alto also used fake news site domains (e.g.,\nvancouversun[.]us, yomiuri[.]us, voanews[.]hk, and nhknews[.]hk) Finally, both operations\n\n\n-----\n\nIn October 2016 Cylance [disclosed information on a threat actor called “PassCV”, which targeted the gaming](https://blog.cylance.com/digitally-signed-malware-targeting-gaming-companies)\nindustry and used stolen code signing certificates to sign malware.\n\nThe disclosure was an update to information [published by Symantec in July 2014 and Kaspersky’s 2013 view into](https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2014-07-21/korean-gaming-industry-still-under-fire)\nWinnti.\n\nCylance lists three malware samples signed with one of the same certificates used to sign one of the Netwire\ndropper files in the operation we report on:\n\n57 BE 1A 00 D2 E5 9B DB D1 95 24 AA A1 7E D9\n3B\n\nIn addition, Cylance also notes the discovery of Netwire being used in the same campaign. The use of Netwire is\nnotable as it is the only other mention of it being used in Chinese-nexus malware operations of which we are aware.\n\nThe disclosure was an update to information [published by Symantec in July 2014 and Kaspersky’s 2013 view into](https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2014-07-21/korean-gaming-industry-still-under-fire)\nWinnti.\n\n### Explaining the Connections\n\nThese overlaps point to a number of potential scenarios. The campaign we analyzed may have been conducted by\nthe same threat actors as the previous operations. Alternatively the overlap may be an artifact of resource sharing\n[between separate but unrelated threat actors — potentially through the use of a “digital quartermaster” (a group that](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-malware-supply-chain.pdf)\nsupplies operators with malware and other resources), or more informal means. While the first scenario is possible,\nwe do not have enough information to fully substantiate it. We suspect that at the least there is some level of sharing\nand reuse of infrastructure by the same operator or group of operators. The targets in most of these other\ncampaigns (ethnic minority groups, government in Southeast Asia, and news sites reporting on China) generally fall\ninto the geopolitical interests and strategic concerns of the government of China. However, we have insufficient\ninformation to conclusively attribute the campaign to a specific threat actor or state sponsor.\n\n## Part 5: Discussion and Conclusion\n\n_This section summarizes the characteristics of the campaign and how it reflects wider information security_\n_challenges for news organizations and journalism._\n\n### A Patient and Persistent Operator\n\nWhile the tactics used in these campaigns are technically simple, the operators demonstrate patience and\npersistence. They have been using content and domains mimicking Chinese-language news sites as lures since at\nleast 2015, and appear to carefully move from one target to another. The phishing campaign against China Digital\nTimes was stood up and taken down in the span of 20 days. In this period, the operators scanned the CDT site for\nvulnerabilities, registered a lookalike domain, created a fake CDT decoy site, and sent the group a wave of\ncustomized phishing emails. When these efforts were not successful the operators quickly shut down the campaign\nand moved on to new targeting. The malware operation also showed efforts to bypass detection and analysis. The\noperators combined obfuscated, packed executables and custom shellcode with an additional step of using\ncompromised servers to host the payload.\n\nThe news sites used for lures and targeting in the operation all report on topics seen as politically sensitive by the\n\n\n-----\n\ngovernment we cannot conclusively attribute this operation to a state sponsor. What we can clearly determine is that\nthis operation was conducted by a threat actor active for at least 2 years that targets Chinese language news\norganizations with intrusion attempts and appears to carefully move from target to target.\n\n### Information Security Challenges for Journalism\n\nThis campaign reflects general information security challenges for news organizations and journalists. Journalists\noperate in high-paced environments under intense time pressures. As part of their practice, they regularly receive\ninformation from unknown sources in a variety of media (e.g., social media, email, chat messages, etc). Gathering\nsources and material requires journalists to be open and accessible online. Journalists also may handle sensitive\ninformation and contacts. Ideally, information security should be part of their standard work process, but information\n[security is but one consideration out of many other competing priorities. Journalists and management may not have](https://medium.com/@mshelton/security-compromises-in-journalism-4cc32ba0709d)\n[the same level of awareness or concern for information security threats. Bridging these gaps, balancing conflicting](https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/popets.2016.2016.issue-4/popets-2016-0048/popets-2016-0048.pdf)\nnecessities for openness, availability, and security all within a resource-constrained environment are major\nchallenges. Nonetheless, information security needs to be addressed.\n\n[The case we analyzed (and many](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/) [others](https://citizenlab.ca/2015/12/packrat-report/) [like it) shows journalists and news groups are being targeted by digital](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/05/stealth-falcon/)\nespionage operations designed to access confidential information and systems. The threat is not only against\njournalists reporting on China. Previous research has found digital espionage operations targeting journalists\n[reporting on the Middle East,](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/05/stealth-falcon/) [Latin America, Russia, and elsewhere. More work is needed to understand the nature](https://citizenlab.ca/2015/12/packrat-report/)\nof the threats and ways to mitigate them that are sensitive to the practicalities and realities of journalism.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to China Digital Times, Epoch Times, Bowen Press, and HK01 for their participation.\n\nThanks to our colleagues for review and assistance: John Scott-Railton, Lotus Ruan, Jeffrey Knockel, Lokman Tsui,\nValkyrie-X Security Research Group, Andrew Hilts, Ron Deibert, and TNG.\n\nThis project was supported by the John T. and Catherine D.
