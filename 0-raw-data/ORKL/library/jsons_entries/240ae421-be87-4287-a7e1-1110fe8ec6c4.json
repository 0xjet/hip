Based on our research, SWEED — which has been\noperating since at least 2017 — primarily targets their victims with stealers and remote\naccess trojans.\n\nSWEED remains consistent across most of their campaigns in their use of spear-phishing\nemails with malicious attachments. While these campaigns have featured a myriad of\ndifferent types of malicious documents, the actor primarily tries to infect its victims with a\npacked version of Agent Tesla — an information stealer that's been around since at least\n2014. The version of Agent Tesla that SWEED is using differs slightly from what we've seen\nin the past in the way that it is packed, as well as how it infects the system. In this post, we'll\nrun down each campaign we're able to connect to SWEED, and talk about some of the\nactor's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).\n\n## 2017: Steganography\n\nOne of the earliest SWEED campaigns Talos identified dates back to 2017. In this attack, the\nactors placed droppers inside of ZIP archives, and then attached those ZIPs to emails. The\nattachments usually had file names similar to \"Java_Updater.zip\" or \"P-O of Jun2017.zip\".\nHere's an example of an email associated with this campaign:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attached ZIP archive contained a packed version of Agent Tesla. The packer uses .NET\nand leverages steganography to hide and decode a second .NET executable, which uses the\nsame technique to retrieve the final Agent Tesla payload. Here's the file stored in the\nresource:\n\nAnd here's the algorithm used to decode the PE stored in that image:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe decoded binary is stored in the array.\n\n## January 2018: Java droppers\n\nIn early 2018, we observed that SWEED began leveraging Java-based droppers. Similar to\nprevious campaigns, the JAR was directly attached to emails and used file names such as\n\"Order_2018.jar\". The purpose of the JAR was to obtain information about the infected\nsystem and facilitate the download of a packed version of Agent Tesla. Interestingly, only a\nfew months prior to these campaigns, a HackForums user with the account name \"Sweed\"\nactively sought out a Java crypter — but we'll get to that activity later.\n\n## April 2018: Office exploit (CVE-2017-8759)\n\nIn April 2018, SWEED began making use of a previously disclosed Office exploit. One of the\ndocuments featured in these email campaigns was notable because it was a PowerPoint\ndocument (PPXS). Code contained inside one of the slides triggers an exploit for CVE-20178759, a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft .NET framework.\n\n\n-----\n\nYou can see the execution of external content hosted on the attacker-controlled web server\nusing the file name \"chuks.png\". As expected, the PNG is not actually an image. Instead, it is\na Soap definition in XML, as seen in the screenshot below:\n\nThe purpose of this code is to decode a URL and download a PE32 hosted on an attackercontrolled web server. The resulting executable is a packed version of Agent Tesla.\n\n## May 2018: Office exploit (CVE-2017-11882)\n\nIn May 2018, campaigns being conducted by SWEED began leveraging another vulnerability\nin Microsoft Office: [CVE-2017-11882, a remote code execution bug in Microsoft Office that is](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11882)\ncommonly observed being leveraged in malicious documents used in commodity malware\ndistribution.\n\nWe see how the vulnerability abuses the Equation Editor in Office when executing the\n[sample in ThreatGrid:](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/threat-grid/index.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nAs seen below, the malicious document is designed to appear as if it is an invoice.\n\nAs consistent with previous campaigns, the purpose of this malicious document is to\ndownload and execute a packed version of Agent Tesla.\n\n## 2019: Office macros and AutoIT droppers\n\nBeginning in 2019, the campaigns associated with SWEED began leveraging malicious\n\n\n-----\n\nOffice macros. As with previous attacks, they are leveraging spear-phishing emails and\nmalicious attachments to initiate the infection process.\n\nThe attached XLS contains an obfuscated VBA macro, which executes a PowerShell script\nusing a WMI call. The PowerShell script is also obfuscated using XOR operations to hide its\ncode. Once decoded, it reveals itself to be .NET.\n\nThis .NET code is responsible for performing some checks and downloading another\nexecutable file. The obfuscation scheme used in this code is the same as the one used in the\npreviously described PowerShell. The downloaded file is then saved and executed.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Call graph after WMI execution._\n\nThe downloaded binary is an AutoIT-compiled script. The script has a lot of junk code\ndesigned to make the analysis more difficult and time-consuming.\n\n_Extracted AutoIT script._\n\nThe strings and some of the commands contained in the AutoIT script have been obfuscated\nusing XOR operations, as described below.\n\nThe decoder receives two hex strings: The first is the string to deobfuscate, while the second\ndetermines the number of rounds of the XOR operation. The XOR operation is performed on\neach character against the length of the second parameter. This operation is then repeated\nfor as many times as the length with the length and the position. If the length value is one,\n\n\n-----\n\nthen the operation is repeated twice using the same key, which leads to a plaintext hex\nstring.\n\nAfter performing environment checks, the malware will reconstruct the assembly code which\nis obfuscated in a hex string. Using the AutoIT scripting language Dll* family functions the\ncode is loaded into the current process address space.\n\n_Memory allocation_\n\nFinally, the malware executes the assembly code with two arguments. The first argument is\nthe path for an executable. This assembly will create a process with the executable and will\ninject the payload into this process.\n\nAs expected, the final payload in this campaign is another packed version of Agent Tesla.\n\n## UAC bypass\n\nOne of the common characteristics with several of the campaigns associated with SWEED is\nthe use of various techniques to bypass User Account Control (UAC) on infected systems.\nAn example of this is present within the campaigns observed in 2019. When the malware is\nfirst executed on systems, it executes \"fodhelper.exe\", which is a Windows process running\nas high integrity. Prior to executing it, the malware sets the following registry key:\n```\nHKCU\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command\n\n```\nThis registry key points to the location of the malicious executable:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis key is used by \"fodhelper.exe\" and its value is executed as administrator whenever\nfodhelper.exe is executed. This functionality simply allows for the malware to bypass UAC\nand is not a privilege escalation vulnerability — the user must already have administrative\naccess rights on the system. It is used to avoid displaying a UAC prompt to the user. This\nsecond instance of the malware is then executed with administrative access to the infected\nsystem.\n\n## SWEED infrastructure\n\nThe various distribution campaigns linked to SWEED feature use of a limited amount of\ndistribution and C2 infrastructure with the same servers used across many different\ncampaigns over long periods of time. The majority of the registrants associated with the\ndomains used by SWEED list the following email addresses:\n```\naaras480@gmail[.]com\nsweed.[redacted]@gmail[.]com\n\n```\nThe registrant contact information used to register most of the domains is also consistent:\n\n[In April 2018, a security researcher published a screenshot of an RDP server believed to](https://twitter.com/mrglaive/status/987780707551469569)\nhave been actively leveraged by SWEED (84.38.134[.]121):\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the screenshot above, the list of user accounts established on the RDP server can be\nseen, which includes an account named \"sweed.\" The fact that multiple users are currently\nactive indicates that this server is being used in a multi-user capacity and provides a platform\non which members of SWEED can function collaboratively. This also likely indicates a\nbusiness relationship between multiple individuals responsible for these ongoing malware\ndistribution campaigns.\n\nWe also identified several DDNS domains which were being used to facilitate connectivity to\nthe shared RDP server that feature many of the same values as the RDP user accounts:\n\n_sweedoffice[.]duckdns[.]org_\n_sweedoffice-olamide[.]duckdns[.]org_\n_sweedoffice-chuks[.]duckdns[.]org_\n_www.sweedoffice-kc.duckdns[.]org_\n_sweedoffice-kc.duckdns[.]org_\n_sweedoffice-goodman.duckdns[.]org_\n_sweedoffice-bosskobi.duckdns[.]org_\n_www.sweedoffice-olamide.duckdns[.]org_\n_www.sweedoffice-chuks.duckdns[.]org_\n\nDuring our analysis of various campaigns associated with SWEED, we identified several\ncommon elements that also reflect the distinct values associated with users of the RDP\nserver. In many cases, the distribution servers being used to host malicious PE32 being\ndistributed by SWEED contained a directory structure consisting of multiple directories\ncontaining the binaries being distributed. In many cases, the binary file names used, as well\n\n\n-----\n\nas the directory names used to host the malicious content reflected the same users present\non the RDP server.\n\nFor example, in June 2019, the following URLs were hosting malicious content associated\nwith these campaigns:\n\n_hxxp://aelna[.]com/file/chuks.exe_\n_hxxp://aelna[.]com/file/sweed.exe_\n_hxxp://aelna[.]com/file/duke.exe_\n\nLikewise, when investigating samples associated with known domains used to exfiltrate\nsensitive information from infected systems, we can see the following binary file names being\nused repeatedly across campaigns over a long period of time:\n\n_dadi.exe_\n_kelly.exe_\n_chuks.exe_\n_olamide.exe_\n_sweed.exe_\n_kc.exe_\n_hero.exe_\n_goodman.exe_\n_duke.exe_\n_hipkid.exe_\n\nIn several cases, the directory structure present on the distribution servers contained multiple\ndirectories hosting malicious files, an example listing below using the domain\nsodismodisfrance[.]cf:\n\n_sodimodisfrance[.]cf/2/chuks.exe_\n_sodimodisfrance[.]cf/6/chuks.exe_\n_sodimodisfrance[.]cf/5/goodman.exe_\n_sodimodisfrance[.]cf/1/chuks.exe_\n_sodimodisfrance[.]cf/1/hipkid.exe_\n_sodimodisfrance[.]cf/5/sweed.exe_\n_sodimodisfrance[.]cf/2/duke.boys.exe_\n\nThese appear to match the handles used by actors known to be associated with SWEED.\nAnother known domain used to exfiltrate sensitive information collected by Agent Tesla is\nsweeddehacklord[.]us. Analysis of known malware seen communicating with this domain\nshows similar patterns of operations.\n\nIn analyzing the malware activity associated with SWEED, we also investigated the use of\ninteresting paths in the hosting of the administration panels associated with the various RATs\nand stealers being distributed by this group. Indeed, on a single C2 server, we identified\nseveral panel with the following URLs:\n\n\n-----\n\n_sweed-office.comie[.]ru/goodman/panel_\n_sweed-office.comie[.]ru/kc/panel/_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/omee/panel/login.php_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-client/humble1/panel/post.php_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-client/sima/panel/post.php_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/omee/panel/post.php_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/kc/panel/post.php_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/olamide/panel/post.php_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/jamil/panel/post.php_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-client/niggab/panel/post.php_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-client/humble2/panel/post.php_\n_wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/harry/panel/post.php_\n\nBased on our research, as well as the panel-hosting locations, we believe that wiki, olamide,\nchuks, kc, goodman, bosskobi, dadi, hipkid, and others are SWEED customers or business\nassociates. Using the binary file names, directory structures, and other artifacts, we have\nbeen able to identify interesting online behavior and interests exhibited across various\nhacking forums, IRC servers, etc. that appear to link some of these users with various\nelements of the malware distribution campaigns.\n\nThere are several other domains that can be linked to SWEED that appear to be associated\nwith various malware families and distribution campaigns. These have been observed to\nresolve to the IP associated with the aforementioned RDP server, as well.\n\n_sweeddehacklord[.]us_\n_sweed-office.comie[.]ru_\n_sweed-viki[.]ru_\n\n### Use of typosquatting\n\nAnother interesting element of many of the campaigns associated with SWEED is the use of\ntyposquatting for the domains used to host the packed Agent Tesla binaries that have been\ndistributed over the past few years.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Victims' geographic dispersion._\n\nLooking at the victimology from a country point of view it is clear that there is no geographic\nfocus, when choosing their target. SWEED target companies all over the world.\n\n_Breakdown of victim's activity by industry._\n\nThe breakdown by activity however does show a clear tendency for manufacturing and\nlogistics companies.\n\nHere's a rundown of these domains, along with the companies they are supposed to look like\nand the industry that the company is associated with. In some cases we were unable to\ndetermine the targeted organization from the typosquatted domain.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn all of the domains listed above, the registrant account information associated with the\ndomains is consistent with what we have identified as associated with SWEED campaign\nactivity.\n\n## Operational Security (OPSEC)\n\n\n-----\n\nWe identified various behavior on hacking forums, IRC channels, and other web sites that\nappeared consistent with the TTPs we observed with the actor distributing this malware.\n\n### \"SWEE D\"\n\nDuring our analysis, we identified a user on HackForums using the moniker \"SWEE D.\" In\nmost of the online posts associated with this user, their contact information was included in\nthe post and listed the Skype address \"sweed.[redacted]\".\n\nIn the months leading up to the January 2018 campaigns, we observed this user posting\nasking for access to a Java crypter. Typically, crypters are used to help evade antivirus\ndetection as they \"crypt\" the contents of the malicious payload being distributed.\n\nThe same user posted repeatedly in threads related to Java crypters, and even annoyed\nother users with how often they were posting:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe same Skype account listed in the HackForums posts was also used by someone using\nthe name \"Daniel\" in 2016 while commenting on a blog related to the creation of Facebook\nphishing pages:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis same Skype account was also used in 2015 by someone going by the name \"[redacted]\nDaniel.\"\n\nNote: [redacted] is also the name used in the email address associated with the registrant\naccount for the domain wlttraco[.]com (sweed.[redacted]@gmail.com).\n\n[We also located screenshots that were published on the Twitter account .sS!.! showing the](https://twitter.com/sS55752750/status/983260208091852800/photo/1)\nDiscord server \"Agent Tesla Live\" that listed sweed ([redacted] Daniel) as a member of the\nstaff.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is important to note that the avatar used by this Discord user (SWEE D) is the same avatar\nthat is used by Skype user sweed.[redacted].\n\nWe actually contacted SWEE D on Skype and were able to confirm that the same user\noperates the Discord and Skype accounts:\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring our interaction with SWEE D, they mentioned that they are a student studying ethical\nhacking and that they work in the IT departments of various companies to help remove\nmalware and increase their security.\n\nThis is contrary to the following activity which was observed in an IRC transaction where a\nuser named \"sweed\" was submitting credit card information to a bot listening in the channel\nin an effort to check the validity and usability of presumably stolen credit card information.\n\nThe IRC channel appeared to be created and used solely for this purpose, with a bot named\n\"chkViadex24\" returning information related to the credit card that was submitted:\n\nThis is an example demonstrating how stolen credit information is actively being used by\nadversaries to determine whether or not they can monetize the information once they have\nstolen it from victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt s possible that SWEE D, sweed and [redacted] Daniel may be the same person. We\nalso identified the following LinkedIn profile that listed the same name:\n\nThis account lists Nigeria as their location. \"[redacted]\" is a Nigerian novel. Many of the\ndetails we identified during our analysis of \"sweed,\" such as information in the LinkedIn\nprofile, the references to \"[redacted],\" the registrant information used, and the location listed\nin the Skype account indicate the individual is likely located in Nigeria. We believe \"sweed\" is\na key member of the group and that other accounts are likely associated with customers or\nbusiness partners.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSWEED has been active for at least three years — and a user with that name has been\nactive on various forums, IRC channels and Discord servers since at least 2015. Currently,\nSWEED is actively targeting small and medium-sized companies around the world. Based on\nthe TTPs used by this group, SWEED should be considered a relatively amateur actor. They\nuse well-known vulnerabilities, commodity stealers and RATs (Pony, Formbook,\nUnknownRAT, Agent Tesla, etc.) and appear to rely on kits readily available on hacking\nforums. SWEED consistently leverages packing and crypting in order to minimize detection\nby anti-malware solutions. We assess that SWEED also does not have effective operational\nsecurity, as they used several of the same online accounts for about five years, allowing for\nthe discovery of a lot of their information, operations and associates.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt this time, we cannot say with certainty whether the other accounts and associated\nindividuals associated with SWEED are business associates or customers. However, they all\nuse the same infrastructure in a coordinated manner across domains, rely on the same\nmalware and packers, and all operate very similarly. While SWEED is relatively well-known in\nthe security research community, this research provides insight into how these cybercriminal\norganizations operate and evolve over time in an effort to maximize their ability to generate\nrevenue and evade detection. We expect SWEED to continue to operate for the foreseeable\nfuture and we will continue to monitor their activities to ensure that customers remain\nprotected.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection)\nmalware detailed in this post.
