The full report can be downloaded here (ungated) and the Indicators of](https://www.cybereason.com/hubfs/dam/collateral/reports/Molerats-in-the-Cloud-New-Malware-Arsenal-Abuses-Cloud-Platforms-in-Middle-East-Espionage-Campaign.pdf)\nCompromise can be downloaded using the link in the header at the top of this blog.\n\n[In February 2020, Cybereason researchers reported the discovery of the Spark and](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/new-cyber-espionage-campaigns-targeting-palestinians-part-one) [Pierogi](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/new-cyber-espionage-campaigns-targeting-palestinians-part-2-the-discovery-of-the-new-mysterious-pierogi-backdoor)\nbackdoors that were assessed to be part of targeted attacks against Palestinian officials. The\n[attacks were attributed to Molerats (aka](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0021/) [The Gaza Cybergang), an Arabic-speaking,](https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergang-group1-operation-sneakypastes/90068/)\npolitically-motivated APT group that has operated in the Middle East since 2012.\n\nThe Cybereason Nocturnus Team has continued tracking the group, and in recent months\ndetected a new campaign leveraging two previously unidentified backdoors dubbed\n_SharpStage, DropBook, as well as a downloader dubbed MoleNet._\n\nThis latest campaign leverages phishing documents that include various themes related to\n[current Middle Eastern events, including a reportedly clandestine meeting between His Royal](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/23/netanyahu-met-with-mbs-pompeo-in-saudi-arabia-israeli-sources)\nHighness Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, the U.S. Secretary of State\nMike Pompeo and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n_Content of the MBS-Israel.pdf document_\n\n## Key Research Findings:\n\n\n-----\n\n**New Espionage Tools Developed by Molerats: Cybereason identified two new backdoors**\ndubbed SharpStage and DropBook, as well as the MoleNet downloader, all of which can\nallow the attackers the ability to execute arbitrary code and collect sensitive data for\nexfiltration from infected computers.\n\nThe newly discovered DropBook backdoor used fake Facebook accounts or Simplenote for\ncommand and control (C2), and both SharpStage and DropBook abuse a Dropbox client in\norder to exfiltrate stolen data as well as for storing their espionage tools.\n\n**Political Phishing Themes: Themes used to lure the victims included the Israeli-Saudi**\nrelations, Hamas elections, Palestinian politicians as well as other regional events including\na secretive meeting between His Royal Highness Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince of\nSaudi Arabia, the U.S. Secretary of State and the Israeli Prime Minister\n\n**Connections to Previous Middle Eastern Campaigns: The newly discovered backdoors**\nhave been observed being used in conjunction with the Spark backdoor previously attributed\nto Molerats. The attackers also used the new espionage tools to download additional\npayloads including the infamous open-source Quasar RAT that was [used previously by](https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergang-updated-2017-activity/82765/)\nMolerats.\n\n**Targeting Across the Middle East: The operation was primarily observed targeting the**\nPalestinian Territories, UAE, Egypt as well as Turkey. Given the nature of the phishing\ncontent, Cybereason assesses that the campaign operators seek to target high ranking\npolitical figures and government officials in the Middle East.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Molerats’ latest campaign Infection Chain_\n\nThe full report, titled Molerats in the Cloud: New Malware Arsenal Abuses Cloud Platforms in\n_Middle East Espionage Campaign, is available for_ [download here.
