And the use\nof these two formats can effectively circumvent the MOTW mechanism (a security measure\nin which Windows displays a warning message when a user tries to open a file downloaded\nfrom the Internet). The effectiveness of the Lazarus group's attack campaign was evident\nback in November '22 when we disclosed that its attack components using the vhdx format\nhad a detection rate of 0 on VirusTotal.\n\nWhen combing through the recently uploaded vhdx files we found that from September to\nDecember 2022, Kasablanka group is suspected of attacking Russia, and its targets include\nthe Russian Federal Government Cooperation Agency, the Ministry of Foreign\nCommunications of the Astrakhan Region of Russia, etc., and the detection rate of some\n**samples is always 0.**\n\nAnalyzing and organizing the captured samples, the Kasablanka group used a socially\nengineered phishing email as the entry point for the attack, with a virtual disk image file\nattached, which nested a variety of next-stage payload executions including lnk files, zip\npackages, and executables. In the early stages of the attack the final execution was the\ncommercial Trojan Warzone RAT, in the later stages of the attack we observed that the\nexecuted Trojan changed to Loda RAT.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Decoy File\n\nA phishing attack against the Agency of the Government of the Russian Federation for CIS\nAffairs, Aliens and International Humanitarian Cooperation, or \"Россотрудничество\".\n\nThe translation of the phishing email content is as follows：\n\n\n-----\n\nPhishing email attack against the Ministry of Foreign Communications of the Astrakhan\nRegion of Russia.\n\nThe translation of the phishing email is as follows:\n\nOne of the phishing email attachments uses the situation related to the Republic of Turkey in\n2022 as a bait.\n\n\n-----\n\nAttacks using articles related to Russian import substitution and migration policy in 2015 as\nbait.\n\nIn addition, the Kasablanka group intercepted the first page from Resolution No. 1725\npublished on the official website of the Government of the Russian Federation as a decoy.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd the relevant content of the draft Digital Code of Kyrgyzstan was used as a bait.\n\n## Sample Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nThe captured samples are all virtual disk image files (.vhdx suffix), and the sample decoy\nnames and contents are in Russian and uploaded from Russian regions. Some of the\nsamples use lnk files as downloaders for the next stage payload.\n\nSome attack samples package the decoy and Warzone RAT into a zip file in a virtual disk\nimage file.\n\nOr there is no decoy file and the lnk file is directly disguised as a folder to lure victims to click\non it.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have sorted out links to download the relevant payloads, as shown in the table below：\n\n**Links** **Remarks**\n\nhttp://179.60.150.118/new.exe Warzone RAT\n\nhttp://89.22.233.149/ms7.hta Unknown\n\nhttp://193.149.129.151/vmsys Unknown\n\nhttp://45.61.137.32/www.exe Warzone RAT\n\nhttp://45.61.137.32/svvhost.rar Loda RAT\n\nhttp://45.61.137.32/Scanned_document.exe Loda RAT\n\n### Warzone RAT\n\nWarzone RAT, also known as AveMaria RAT, is a commercial trojan developed in pure\nC/C++, which has been sold publicly on the internet as a software subscription since 2018\nand is compatible with systems below Windows 10, with remote desktop, password stealing,\nkeylogging, remote commands, permission elevation, download execution and many other\nremote control functions. It has been used by several APT groups, including Confucius,\nBitter, Blind Eagle (APT-Q-98) and other groups .\n\n\n-----\n\nThis captured Warzone RAT eventually establishes a TCP connection to the server\nhbfyewtuvfbhsbdjhjwebfy.net (193.188.20.163) .\n\n\n-----\n\nIt has a wide variety of remote control commands, including the following functions.：\n\n**Function**\n**number** **Function**\n\n0x0 Obtain information about the controlled machine\n\n0x2 Get process list information\n\n0x4 Get drive information\n\n0x6 Get directory information\n\n0x8 Retrieving files from the victim device's folder\n\n0xA Delete the specified file\n\n0xC Ends the specified process\n\n0xE Remote shell\n\n0x10 Ends the specified thread\n\n0x12 List the victim's camera device information\n\n0x14 Turn on the camera\n\n0x16 Stop the camera\n\n0x18 Get the title of the active program\n\n0x1A Exit and delete your own files\n\n0x1C Downloading files to the controlled end\n\n0x20 Get browser password\n\n0x22 Download the file from the given URL to the controlled end and execute\nit\n\n0x24 Online keylogging\n\n0x26 Offline keylogging\n\n0x28 Install HRDP Manager on the victim's device\n\n0x2A Enable reverse proxy\n\n0x2C Stop reverse proxy\n\n0x30 Start remote VNC\n\n\n-----\n\n**Function**\n**number** **Function**\n\n0x32 Shutting down remote VNC\n\n0x38 Reverse proxy port settings\n\n0x3A Execute or open the specified file\n\n0x48 Injection into the specified process\n\n0x4A Traversing to get file information\n\n0x4C Multiple post-command breakdowns, including shutdown, network test,\nexit, etc\n\n### Loda RAT\n\nLoda RAT is a proprietary malware written in AutoIt script language, first captured and\ndisclosed in the wild by Proofpoint in September 2016, the name 'Loda' derives from the\nmalware author's choice of directory to write keylogger logs to as Loda.Subsequently Cisco\ndiscovered multiple variants of Loda RAT and found that the RAT added spying capabilities\nto the Android platform. After a series of investigations, Cisco concluded that the group using\nthe malware was based in Morocco and named the group Kasablanka (the largest city in\nMorocco) [1].\n\nAnalysis of the captured sample showed that it was written in C# and obfuscated so\nextensively that common tools could not decompile it, and added a large amount of 00 data\nat the end of the PE file, swelling the entire file size to 741MB.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter execution, the sample first releases and executes the Loda RAT packaged with AutoIt\nin the %appdata% directory, and the AutoIt script can be restored by using the deep analysis\nfunction of QiAnXin's Threat Intelligence Center Cloud Sandbox, and the behavior and\nfunctions of the trojan can be seen by analyzing the script.\n\nLoda RAT first detect antivirus products installed on victim machines through WMI\ncommands.\n\nFollowed operation is collecting some information of victim host, including permissions,\noperating system version, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd adding persistentence by creating %appdata%\\Windata\\svshost.exe and NFOKQN.lnk\nshortcut to svshost.exe in windows startup directory.\n\nUploading the collected information and then takeing screenshots.\n\nSubsequently enter the remote control loop, by processing the data returned by C2, and then\ncorrespond to the detailed remote control instructions, and its remote control instructions\ndivided into a relatively fine function, rough statistics have 144 remote control instructions,\ndue to the reasons of space, we will not do a detailed introduction, a general overview of its\nremote control functions.\n\nRecording\n\n\n-----\n\nUpload and download files\nExecute the specified file\nShutdown\nClose the specified process\nStealing user cookies, passwords\nTurn on keylogger\nDelete keylogger data\nDownload and execute the file from the specified URL\nGet file or directory size\nAllow RDP connections by modifying the registry\nCompressing/uncompressing files\nCopy files or directories\nEnumerate connected drives\nEnumerate hot folder locations\nDetect UAC settings\nSend mouse clicks (to the left or right is a separate command）\nCapture screenshots and send to C2\nOpen/close CD trays\nRecording\nTurn off Windows Firewall\nSend the name of running processes to C2\nExit, uninstall\nCreate a GUI chat window to save the victim/attacker conversation to a file\n\nIn addition, in the previous version, LodaRAT downloaded SQLite3.dll from the official AutoIt\nwebsite because it was needed to extract sensitive information from the browser database,\nbut the embedded URL had been unavailable for download. So in the latest version, the\nKasablanka group transcoded it directly to hex, embedded in in the script.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Association & Attribution\n\nIn C2:193.149.129.151, we trace back to Trojan \"systeml.dll\", written in C# and only 8.5KB in\nsize, whose function is to download WinScp tools to synchronize files with remote computers\nand set scheduled tasks to persist, making it a potential backdoor.\n\nIn another C2: 179.60.150.118, we associate two files packaged by Pyinstaller, both of them\nare downloaders and have the same core code.\n\nAfter Base64 decoding, you can clearly see that by requesting port 443 of 179.60.150.118 to\nget the follow-up payload to execute, and the payload is Warzone RAT or CS Trojan.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome security vendors believe that Loda RAT is the exclusive trojan of Kasablanka group,\nbut since Loda RAT is compiled from AutoIt scripts and its source code can be obtained by\ndecompiling it, 'false flag' activities by other threat actors using the decompiled source code\nare also possible.\n\nIn terms of attack motivation, we believe that the purpose of this attack is mainly for\ninformation gathering and espionage. Considering the current situation between Russia and\nUkraine, intelligence spying and espionage are more in line with the motivation of nationsponsered hacker groups, so we attribute this attack to Kasablanka group with moderate\nconfidence.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn previous disclosures of the Kasablanka group's operations, its targets included\nBangladesh, South America and the United States, and its Loda RAT includes Windows\nversion and Android version.Now this group often uses commercial RATs in its attack\nactivities, which not only reduces the development cost but also makes it difficult for tracing\nattackers’ footprints.\n\nThe RedDrip team would like to remind all users not to open links of unknown origin shared\nby social media, not to click on email attachments from unknown sources, not to run\nunknown files with exaggerated titles, not to install APPs from informal sources, to back up\nimportant files in a timely manner, and to update and install patches.\n\nIf you need to run or install an application of unknown origin, you can first identify it through\nthe QiAnXin Threat Intelligence File Deep Analysis Platform\n(https://sandbox.ti.qianxin.com/sandbox/page). At present, it supports deep analysis of files\nin various formats including Windows and Android platforms.\n\nCurrently, a full line of products based on the threat intelligence data from the QiAnXin\nThreat Intelligence Center, including the QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP),\nSkyRock, QiAnXin Advanced Threat Detection System, QiAnXin NGSOC, QiAnXin\nSituational Awareness, etc., already support the accurate detection of such attacks [2].\n\n\n-----\n\n## IOCs\n\n**MD5**\n\n4d75d26590116a011cbebb87855f4b4f\n\n574e031a4747d5e6315b894f983d3001\n\n56d1e9d11a8752e1c06e542e78e9c3e4\n\ndb9f2d7b908755094a2a6caa35ff7509\n\n8f52ea222d64bbc4d629ec516d60cbaf\n\nc3b3cb77fcec534763aa4d3b697c2f8c\n\n9ea108e031d29ee21b3f81e503eca87d\n\n23d5614fcc7d2c54ed54fb7d5234b079\n\n6be3aecc5704c16bf275e17ca8625f46\n\ne4a678b4aa95607a2eda20a570ffb9e1\n\n11ed3f8c1a8fce3794b650bbdf09c265\n\n8a548f927ab546efd76eeb78b8df7d4c\n\n6d710d1a94445efb0890c8866250958e\n\n6b42e4c5aecd592488c4434b47b15fbb\n\n\n-----\n\nd82743e8f242b6a548a17543c807b7b0\n\n32a0a7fa5893dd8d1038d1d1a9bc277a\n\nbd5c665187dfb73fc81163c2c03b2ddf\n\na07c6e759e51f856c96fc3434b6aa9f8\n\n0dcd949983cb49ad360428f464c19a9e\n\n87125803f156d15ed3ce2a18fe9da2b8\n\n4f7e2f5b0f669599e43463b70fb514ad\n\n00b9b126a3ed8609f9c41971155307be\n\n**C2**\n\n179.60.150.118\n\n45.61.137.32\n\n89.22.233.149\n\n193.149.129.151\n\n193.149.176.254\n\n## Reference Links\n\n[1] https://blog.talosintelligence.com/kasablanka-lodarat/\n\n[2] https://ti.qianxin.com/\n\nKASABLANKA\nAPT\nTHE MIDDLE EAST\n\n分享到：\n\n\n-----",
