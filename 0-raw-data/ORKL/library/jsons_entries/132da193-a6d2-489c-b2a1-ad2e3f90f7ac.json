Why the MSS insists on using sloppy contracted hackers is beyond us here at\nIntrusion Truth, but the pattern is undeniable.\n\nWhat isn’t clear is how widespread it is. As we asked in December, what if all regional\n**offices of the MSS have their own APT? Could the trail of crumbs be followed in reverse?**\n\nCould we start an investigation with an MSS Cyber Officer and identify the APT they\nmanage?\n\n**Starting with the MSS**\n\nWe recently received a tip from a friendly source that prefers to remain anonymous, but\nwhose identity we have independently verified. The source named an individual based in\nJinan, a sprawling city famous for its many natural springs. The source claimed that the\nindividual worked for the MSS on Cyber issues and might be involved in APT hacking.\n\nThis was the perfect opportunity to look for an APT and to test our hypothesis.\n\n\n-----\n\nExperts working with this blog conducted an investigation.\n\nWe will bring you the results this week.\n\n#weknowwherethisleads\n\n\n-----",
