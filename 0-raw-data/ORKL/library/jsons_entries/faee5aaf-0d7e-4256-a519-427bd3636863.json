Android\nbotnet is a common malware type that cybercriminals use to gain access to targeted devices. These devices can be\ncontrolled remotely to carry out various malicious activities.\n\n[Cyble Research & Intelligence Labs (CRIL) recently analyzed an Android Botnet shared by MalwareHunterTeam. The](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1647191683069620224)\nmentioned malicious sample is the Trojanized version of the Psiphon application and identified as DAAM Android\nBotnet, which provides below features:\n\nKeylogger\nRansomware\nVOIP call recordings\nExecuting code at runtime\nCollects browser history\nRecords incoming calls\nSteals PII data\nOpens phishing URL\nCapture photos\nSteal clipboard data\nSwitch WiFi and Data status\n\nThe DAAM Android botnet provides an APK binding service wherein a Threat Actor (TA) can bind malicious code with a\nlegitimate app. CRIL analyzed an APK file named PsiphonAndroid.s.apk with the hash value of\n“184356d900a545a2d545ab96fa6dd7b46f881a1a80ed134db1c65225e8fa902b” which contains DAAM botnet\nmalicious code bonded with a legitimate Psiphon application.\n\nThe malware connects to the Command and Control (C&C) server hxxp://192.99.251[.]51:3000, and the figure below\nshows the DAAM Android botnet admin panel.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 – Admin panel of DAAM Android botnet_\nThe C&C server is also present in various malicious applications, some of which were initially identified in August 2021.\nThis indicates that the DAAM Android botnet has been operational since 2021 and constantly targeting Android users.\n\n_Figure 2 – C&C server present in several malicious applications_\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n**APK Metadata Information**\n\n**App Name: Psiphon**\n**Package Name: com.psiphon3**\n**SHA256 Hash: 184356d900a545a2d545ab96fa6dd7b46f881a1a80ed134db1c65225e8fa902b**\n\nThe figure below shows the metadata information of the application.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 – Application metadata information_\nInitially, the malware establishes a socket connection and communicates with the C&C server at\nhxxp://192.99.251[.]51:3000 to obtain commands for carrying out a range of malicious activities, as depicted in the\nfigure below.\n\n_Figure 4 – Socket connection_\n\n_Figure 5 – Malware receiving commands_\nThe DAAM Android botnet provides various command operations, which are explained below:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Keylogger:\n\nMalware uses the Accessibility Service to monitor users’ activity. It saves the captured keystrokes along with the\napplication’s package name into a database, as shown in the figure below.\n\n_Figure 6 – Keylogger activity_\n\n### Ransomware:\n\nThe DAAM botnet provides a Ransomware module that leverages the AES algorithm to encrypt and decrypt files on\nthe infected device. It retrieves the password required for encryption and decryption from the C&C server. The malware\nalso saves a ransom note in the “readme_now.txt” file.\n\nThe Ransomware activity is illustrated in the figure below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 – Ransomware encryption and decryption module_\n\n_Figure 8 – Receiving password from C&C server and writes ransom message into a readme_now.txt file_\n\n### VOIP call Recordings:\n\nThe DAAM botnet exploits the Accessibility service to monitor the components of social media applications such as\nWhatsApp, Skype, Telegram, and many others responsible for VOIP calls. If the user interacts with the belowmentioned components, malware initiates audio recording.\n\nBelow is the list of components targeted by the DAAM botnet:\n\ncom.whatsapp.VoipActivity\ncom.whatsapp.VoipActivityV2\ncom.whatsapp.voipcalling.VoipActivityV2\ncom.bbm.ui.voice.activities.InCallActivity\ncom.bbm.ui.voice.activities.InCallActivityNew\ncom.bbm.ui.voice.activities.IncomingCallActivityNew\ncom.turkcell.bip.voip.call.InCallActivity\ncom.turkcell.bip.voip.call.IncomingCallActivity\nim.thebot.messenger.activity.chat.AudioActivity\nim.thebot.messenger.activity.chat.VideoActivity\nim.thebot.messenger.voip.ui.AudioCallActivity\nim.thebot.messenger.voip.ui.VideoCallActivity\ncom facebook mlite rtc view CallActivity\n\n\n-----\n\ncom.facebook.rtc.activities.WebrtcIncallActivity\ncom.facebook.rtc.activities.WebrtcIncallFragmentHostActivity\ncom.google.

The malware communicates with the received URL to fetch parameters of the targeted\nmethod, which is responsible for executing other malicious activities. The dynamic code runner module is illustrated in\nthe below image.\n\n_Figure 11 – Running dynamic code_\n\n### Stealing PII data:\n\nIn addition to the functionalities mentioned above, the DAAM botnet gathers Personally Identifiable Information (PII)\nfrom the infected device, including but not limited to contacts, SMS messages, call logs, files, basic device details, and\nlocation data\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12 – Collecting call logs_\n\n_13 – Collecting basic device information_\n\n\n_Figure_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14 – Collecting SMSs_ _Figure 15 – Stealing_\n\n_location_\n\n### Opening URL:\n\nMalware can receive a phishing URL from a C&C server, then load it into a WebView component to steal the victim’s\nlogin information. The TA can use this feature to launch a social engineering attack by sending a phishing URL of their\nchoice from the C&C panel.\n\n\n-----\n\n_16 – Opening Phishing URL_\n\n### Collecting Screenshots:\n\nThe code in the below image is used by malware to steal screenshots saved at the external Storage path\n“/Pictures/Screenshots” of an infected device and sends them to the C&C server.\n\n_Collecting screenshots_\n\n### Capturing Photos:\n\n\n_Figure_\n\n_Figure 17 –_\n\n\nAdditionally, the malware captures pictures by opening the camera of the victim’s device upon receiving a command\nfrom the admin panel and subsequently sending pictures to the C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 18 –_\n\n_Capturing photos_\nIn addition to the main functionalities mentioned earlier, the DAAM botnet can carry out additional tasks such as\nswitching WiFi and data, showing random toast, and collecting clipboard data.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMalware authors often leverage genuine applications to distribute malicious code to avoid suspicion. DAAM Android\nbotnet also provides a similar APK binding service where TA can bind malicious code with a legitimate APK to appear\ngenuine.\n\nDetailed analysis of the DAAM Android botnet indicates that it offers several intriguing capabilities, such as\nRansomware, runtime code execution, and Keylogger, among others. Although relatively fewer samples have been\nidentified so far, based on the malware’s capability, it may target a wide number of users in the coming days.\n\n## Our Recommendations\n\nWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against attackers.
