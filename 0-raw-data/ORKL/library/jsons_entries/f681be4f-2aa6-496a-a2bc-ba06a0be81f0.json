    "plain_text": "# The evolution of a Mac trojan: UpdateAgent’s progression\n\n**[microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/02/02/the-evolution-of-a-mac-trojan-updateagents-progression/](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/02/02/the-evolution-of-a-mac-trojan-updateagents-progression/)**\n\nFebruary 2, 2022\n\nOur discovery and analysis of a sophisticated Mac trojan in October exposed a year-long evolution of\na malware family—and depicts the rising complexity of threats across platforms. The trojan, tracked\nas UpdateAgent, started as a relatively basic information-stealer but was observed distributing\nsecondary payloads in the latest campaign, a capability that it added in one of its multiple iterations.\nReminiscent of the progression of info-stealing trojans in other platforms, UpdateAgent may similarly\nbecome a vector for other threats to infiltrate target systems.\n\nSince its first appearance in September 2020, the malware displayed an increasing progression of\nsophisticated capabilities, and while the latest two variants were sporting much more refined\nbehavior compared with earlier versions, they show signs that the malware is still in the development\nstage and more updates are likely to come. The latest campaign saw the malware installing the\nevasive and persistent Adload adware, but UpdateAgent’s ability to gain access to a device can\ntheoretically be further leveraged to fetch other, potentially more dangerous payloads.\n\nUpdateAgent lures its victims by impersonating legitimate software and can leverage Mac device\nfunctionalities to its benefit. One of the most advanced techniques found in UpdateAgent’s latest\ntoolbox is bypassing Gatekeeper controls, which are designed to ensure only trusted apps run on\nMac devices. The trojan can leverage existing user permissions to quietly perform malicious activities\nbefore deleting the evidence to cover its tracks. UpdateAgent also misuses public cloud\ninfrastructure, namely Amazon S3 and CloudFront services, to host its additional payloads. We\nshared our findings with the team at Amazon Web Services, and they have taken down the malicious\nURLs–another example of how intelligence sharing and collaboration results in better security for the\nbroader community.\n\nThreats like UpdateAgent are proof that, as environments continue to rely on a diverse range of\ndevices and operating systems, organizations need security solutions that can provide protection\n[across platforms and a complete picture of their security posture. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-protection/endpoint-defender)\ndelivers and coordinates threat defense across all major OS platforms including Windows, macOS,\nLinux, Android and iOS. On macOS devices, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects and exposes\nthreats and vulnerabilities through its antivirus, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and threat\nand vulnerability management capabilities.\n\nIn this blog post, we share the evolving development of the UpdateAgent trojan targeting Mac users\nand detail the malware’s recent campaign to compromise devices, steal sensitive information, and\ndistribute adware as a secondary payload.\n\n## Progression of UpdateAgent\n\nUpdateAgent is uniquely characterized by its gradual upgrading of persistence techniques, a key\nfeature that indicates this trojan will likely continue to use more sophisticated techniques in future\ncampaigns. Like many information-stealers found on other platforms, the malware attempts to\n\n\n-----\n\ninfiltrate macOS machines to steal data and it is associated with other types of malicious payloads,\nincreasing the chances of multiple infections on a device.\n\nThe trojan is likely distributed via drive-by downloads or advertisement pop-ups, which impersonate\nlegitimate software such as video applications and support agents. This action of impersonating or\nbundling itself with legitimate software increases the likelihood that users are tricked into installing\nthe malware. Once installed, UpdateAgent starts to collect system information that is then sent to its\ncommand-and-control (C2) server.\n\nNotably, the malware’s developer has periodically updated the trojan over the last year to improve\nupon its initial functions and add new capabilities to the trojan’s toolbox. The timeline below illustrates\na series of techniques adopted by UpdateAgent from September 2020 through October 2021:\n\n_Figure 1. Tracking the evolution of UpdateAgent_\n\n**September–December 2020: The initial version of UpdateAgent was considered to be a fairly**\nbasic information-stealer. At the time, the malware was only capable of performing\nreconnaissance to scan and collect system information such as product names and versions.\nOnce gathered, the data was then sent as heartbeats to the malware’s C2 server.\n\n**January–February 2021: Approximately two months later, UpdateAgent maintained its original**\ncapabilities and added a new one: the ability to fetch secondary payloads as .dmg files from\npublic cloud infrastructure. DMG files are mountable disk images used to distribute software\nand apps to macOS, allowing the trojan to easily install additional programs on affected\ndevices.\n\n\n-----\n\n**March 2021: Upon its third update, the malware altered one of its prior functions to fetch**\nsecondary payloads as .zip files instead of .dmg files. The malware’s developer also included\ntwo new capabilities: the ability to bypass Gatekeeper by removing the downloaded file’s\nquarantine attribute and the ability to create a PLIST file that is added to the LaunchAgent\nfolder. The quarantine attribute forces Gatekeeper to block the launch of any file downloaded\nfrom the web or other unknown sources, and it also displays a pop-up warning that users\ncannot open the respective file as “it is from an unidentified developer”. By removing the\nattribute, the malware both prevented the pop-up message warning users and allowed the files\nto launch without being blocked by Gatekeeper. Moreover, as the LaunchAgent folder specifies\nwhich apps and code automatically run each time a user signs into the machine, adding the\nmalware’s PLIST file allowed it to be included in these automatic launches for persistence upon\nusers signing into the affected device.\n\n**August 2021: The malware’s fourth update further altered some of its prior capabilities. For**\none, it expanded its reconnaissance function to scan and collect System_profile and\nSPHardwaretype information. Additionally, UpdateAgent was changed to create and add PLIST\nfiles to the LaunchDaemon folder instead of the LaunchAgent folder. While targeting the\n_LaunchDaemon folder instead of the LaunchAgent folder required administrative privileges, it_\npermitted the malware to inject persistent code that ran as root. This code generally takes the\nform of background processes that don’t interact with users, thus it also improved the trojan’s\nevasiveness.\n\n**October 2021: We detected the latest variants of UpdateAgent just over a year since its**\nrelease into the wild. Sporting many of the updates found in the August 2021 variant,\nUpdateAgent still performed system reconnaissance, communicated with the C2 server as\nheartbeats, and bypassed Gatekeeper. Additionally, the October update expanded the\nmalware’s ability to fetch secondary payloads as both .dmg or .zip files from public cloud\ninfrastructure, rather than choosing between filetypes. Among its new capabilities, UpdateAgent\nincluded the ability to enumerate LSQuarantineDataURLString using SQLite in order to validate\nwhether the malware’s downloaded app is within the Quarantine Events database where it\nwould be assigned a quarantine attribute. The upgrade also allowed the malware to leverage\nexisting user profiles to run commands requiring sudo access in addition to the ability to add\narguments using PlistBuddy to create and edit PLIST files more easily. Lastly, the trojan\nincluded the ability to modify sudoers list, allowing the malware to bypass a prompt requiring\nhigh privilege user credentials while running UpdateAgent’s downloaded app.\n\n### October 2021 Campaign\n\nIn the [October 2021 campaign, UpdateAgent included a larger set of sophisticated techniques than](https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1451279679059488773)\never previously observed. The attackers distributed the trojanized app in .zip or .pkg format,\nconforming with a campaign observed in early 2021:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Attack chain of the latest UpdateAgent campaign_\nUpon analyzing UpdateAgent’s infrastructure, we determined that the infrastructure used in the\nOctober 2021 campaign was created at the end of September 2021, and we also discovered\nadditional domains with payloads. This indicates that the trojan is still in the developmental stage and\nis likely to add or modify its capabilities in future updates and continue its track of improving its\noverall level of sophistication.\n\nWe further observed two separate variants of the UpdateAgent trojan in its October 2021 campaign.\nEach variant leveraged different tactics to infect a device, as detailed below:\n\n### Variant 1\n\nThe first variant of UpdateAgent takes the following steps to infect a device:\n\n1. A .zip file named HelperModule.zip downloads and installs UpdateAgent using a specific file\n\npath – /Library/Application Support/xxx/xxx. This .zip file is installed in /Library/Application\n_Support/Helper/HelperModule._\n2. UpdateAgent collects operating system and hardware information about the affected device.\n\nOnce the compromised device connects to the C2 server, the trojan uses a curl request to send\nthis data to the C2 server.\n3. Upon successful connection, UpdateAgent requests a secondary payload, usually a .dmg or\n\n_.zip file, which is hosted on a CloudFront instance._\n4. Once the secondary payload downloads, UpdateAgent uses the xattr command – /usr/bin/xattr\n\n_-rc /tmp/setup.dmg, to remove the quarantine attribute of downloaded files and bypass_\nGatekeeper controls.\n5. UpdateAgent then extracts the secondary payload (.dmg or .zip). Once the file is mounted, it\n\nunzips and copies the payload files to a temporary folder, assigning executable permissions,\nand launches these files. UpdateAgent also uses PlistBuddy to create PLIST files under the\n_LaunchAgent folder to remain persistent through system restart._\n6. UpdateAgent removes evidence by deleting the secondary payload, temporary folders, PLIST\n\nfiles, and all other downloaded artifacts.\n\n### Variant 2\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second variant of UpdateAgent takes the following steps to infect a device:\n\n1. A third-party WebVideoPlayer application (WebVideoPlayer.pkg) with a post-install script\n\ndownloads additional apps or .zip files as\n_/Applications/WebVideoPlayer.app/Contents/MacOS/WebVideoPlayer. Notably, this application_\nincluded a valid certificate that was later revoked by Apple in October 2021.\n2. The application scans the user profile to identify existing user IDs and assigned groups.\n3. The WebVideoPlayer application uses SQLite3 commands to determine if the .pkg file is within\n\nthe Quarantine Events database, which contains URLs of downloaded files, mail addresses,\nand subjects for saved attachments.\n4. The .pkg payload extracts and drops UpdateAgent in /Library/Application\n\n_Support/WebVideoPlayer/WebVideoPlayerAgent._\n5. The WebVideoPlayer application also assigns executable permissions to UpdateAgent and\n\nattempts to remove the quarantine attribute of the file using the xattr command to bypass\nGatekeeper controls.\n6. The application then launches UpdateAgent and collects and sends the OS information to the\n\nattacker’s C2 server. Like the first variant, the second variant sends curl requests that download\nadditional payloads, such as adware, and removes evidence by deleting all files and folders\nthat it created.\n\n### Adload adware\n\nUpdateAgent is further characterized by its ability to fetch secondary payloads that can increase the\nchances of multiple infections on a device, with the latest campaign pushing adware. We first\nobserved UpdateAgent distributing adware as a secondary payload in its October 2021 campaign,\nidentified as part of the Adload adware family by Microsoft Defender Antivirus.\n\nSimilar to UpdateAgent, adware is often included in potentially unwanted or malicious software\nbundles that install the adware alongside impersonated or legitimate copies of free programs. In\nAdload’s case, we previously observed the adware family targeting macOS users had spread via\nrogue installers often found on malicious websites.\n\nOnce adware is installed, it uses ad injection software and techniques to intercept a device’s online\ncommunications and redirect users’ traffic through the adware operators’ servers, injecting\nadvertisements and promotions into webpages and search results. More specifically, Adload\nleverages a Person-in-The-Middle (PiTM) attack by installing a web proxy to hijack search engine\nresults and inject advertisements into webpages, thereby siphoning ad revenue from official website\nholders to the adware operators.\n\nAdload is also an unusually persistent strain of adware. It is capable of opening a backdoor to\ndownload and install other adware and payloads in addition to harvesting system information that is\nsent to the attackers’ C2 servers. Considering both UpdateAgent and Adload have the ability to\ninstall additional payloads, attackers can leverage either or both of these vectors to potentially deliver\nmore dangerous threats to target systems in future campaigns.\n\n## Defending against macOS threats\n\n\n-----\n\nUpdateAgent s evolution displays the increasing complexity of threats across platforms. Its\ndevelopers steadily improved the trojan over the last year, turning a basic information-stealer into a\npersistent and more sophisticated piece of malware. This threat also exemplifies the trend of\ncommon malware increasingly harboring more dangerous threats, a pattern also observed in other\nplatforms. UpdateAgent’s ability to gain access to a device can theoretically be leveraged by\nattackers to introduce potentially more dangerous payloads, emphasizing the need to identify and\nblock threats such as this.\n\nDefenders can take the following mitigation steps to defend against this threat:\n\n[Encourage the use of Microsoft Edge—available on macOS and various platforms—or other](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)\n[web browsers that support Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, which identifies and blocks](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-smartscreen)\nmalicious websites, including phishing sites, scam sites, and sites that contain exploits and host\nmalware.\nRestrict access to privileged resources, such as LaunchDaemons or LaunchAgents folders and\nsudoers files, through OSX enterprise management solutions. This helps to mitigate common\npersistence and privilege escalation techniques.\nInstall apps from trusted sources only, such as a software platform’s official app store. Thirdparty sources may have lax standards for the applications that they host, allowing malicious\nactors to upload and distribute malware.\nRun the latest version of your operating systems and applications. Deploy the latest security\nupdates as soon as they become available.\n\nAs organizational environments are intricate and heterogenous, running multiple applications, clouds,\nand devices, they require solutions that can protect across platforms. Microsoft Defender for\nEndpoint offers cross-platform security and a unified investigation experience that gives customers\nvisibility across all endpoints and enables them to detect, manage, respond, and remediate threats,\nsuch as the capability to detect UpdateAgent’s anomalous use of PlistBuddy.\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint customers can apply the following mitigations to reduce the\nenvironmental attack surface and mitigate the impact of this threat and its payloads:\n\nTurn on [cloud-delivered protection and](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/mac-preferences?view=o365-worldwide#cloud-delivered-protection-preferences) [automatic sample submission on Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/mac-preferences?view=o365-worldwide#enable--disable-automatic-sample-submissions)\nDefender Antivirus. These capabilities use artificial intelligence and machine learning to quickly\nidentify and stop new and unknown threats.\n[Enable potentially unwanted application (PUA) protection in block mode to automatically](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/mac-pua?view=o365-worldwide)\nquarantine PUAs like adware. PUA blocking takes effect on endpoint clients after the next\nsignature update or computer restart. PUA blocking takes effect on endpoint clients after the\nnext signature update or computer restart.\nTurn on [network protection to block connections to malicious domains and IP addresses.](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/network-protection?view=o365-worldwide)\n\nDefender for Endpoint’s next-generation protection reinforces network security perimeters and\nincludes antimalware capabilities to catch emerging threats, including UpdateAgent and its\nsecondary payloads, C2 communications, and other malicious artifacts affiliated with the trojan’s\nreconnaissance activities. Moreover, macOS antimalware detections provide insight into where a\nthreat originated and how the malicious process or activity was created, providing security teams a\ncomprehensive view of incidents and attack chains.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, this research underscores the importance of understanding a macOS threat s progression to\nnot only remedy its current abilities, but to prepare for increased capabilities and sophistication of the\nthreat. As threats on other OS platforms continue to grow, our security solutions must secure users’\ncomputing experiences be it a Windows or non-Windows machine. By sharing our research and\nother forms of threat intelligence, collaboration across the larger security community can aid in\nenriching our protection technologies, regardless of the platform or device in use.\n\n### Detection details\n\n**Antivirus**\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus detects threat components and behavior as the following
