All the artifacts had very low Anti-Virus (AV)\ndetection rates on VirusTotal when they were first submitted.\nAt the time of the discovery, the C2 infrastructure hosted in France was still live.\nThe campaign used NATO’s upcoming trainings as a lure.\nThe campaign targeted a specific government body in Azerbaijan, however; it is likely that attackers also\ntargeted NATO members or other countries involved in NATO exercises.\n[Analysis revealed interesting correlations with ReconHell/BlackWater attack, which we uncovered in August.](https://quointelligence.eu/2020/08/blackwater-malware-leveraging-beirut-tragedy-in-new-targeted-campaign/)\nAs part of our responsible disclosure, we reported our findings to French authorities for taking down the C2,\nand to NATO for their awareness.\n\n## Introduction\n\nOn 9 August, QuoIntelligence disseminated a Warning to its government customers about a new APT28 (aka\n[Sofacy, Sednit, Fancy Bear, STRONTIUM, etc.) campaign targeting government bodies of NATO members (or](https://www.nato.int/)\ncountries cooperating with NATO). In particular, we found a malicious file uploaded to VirusTotal, which ultimately\ndrops a Zebrocy malware and communicates with a C2 in France. After our discovery, we reported the malicious\nC2 to the French law enforcement as part of our responsible disclosure process.\n\nZebrocy is a malware used by APT28 (also known as Sofacy), which was reported by multiple security firms[1][2]\n\n[3][4][5][6] in the last two years.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, our investigation concluded that the attack started on 5 August and targeted at least a government entity\nlocated in the Middle East. However, it is highly likely that NATO members also observed the same attack.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n**File Name** Course 5 – 16 October 2020.zipx\n\n**SHA256** **e6e19633ba4572b49b47525b5a873132dfeb432f075fbba29831f1bc59d5885d**\n\n\n**First**\n**Submission**\n**to VT**\n\n**First AV**\n**detetction**\n**rate**\n\n\n2020-08-05T12:28:27\n\nReally Low (3/61)\n\n\nAt a first look, the sample seems to be a valid JPEG image file:\n\nIn fact, if the file is renamed as a JPG, the Operating System will show the logo of the Supreme Headquarters\n[Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), which is the NATO’s Allied Command Operations (ACO) located in Belgium.](https://shape.nato.int/)\n\nHowever, further analysis revealed the sample as having a Zip file concatenated. This technique works because\nJPEG files are parsed from the beginning of the file and some Zip implementations parse Zip files from the end of\nthe file (since the index is located there) without looking at the signature in the front.\n\nThe technique is also used by threat actors to evade AVs, or other filtering systems since they might mistake the\nfile for a JPEG and skip it. Interestingly, in order to trigger the decompression of the file on Windows after the user\nclicks on it, the following conditions need to be met: a) the file must be correctly named .zip(x); b) the file needs to\nbe opened with WinRAR. The file will show an error message claiming it is corrupted if the targeted victim uses\nWinZip or the default Windows utility.\n\nAfter decompressing the appended ZIP file, the following two samples are dropped:\n\n\n-----\n\nCourse 5 16 October 2020.exe (Zebrocy malware)                 SHA256:\naac3b1221366cf7e4421bdd555d0bc33d4b92d6f65fa58c1bb4d8474db883fec\n\nCourse 5 – 16 October 2020.xls (Corrupted file)                        SHA256:\nb45dc885949d29cba06595305923a0ed8969774dae995f0ce5b947b5ab5fe185\n\nConsidering the lure uses a NATO image, the attackers likely picked the filenames in order to leverage upcoming\n[NATO courses in October 2020. Additionally, the Excel file (XLS) is corrupted and cannot be opened by Microsoft](https://www.natoschool.nato.int/Academics/Portfolio/Course-Catalogue#2aid-aid)\nExcel, it contains – what seems to be – information about military personnel involved in the military mission\n“African Union Mission for Somalia”. The long list of information includes names, ranks, unit, arrival/leave dates,\nand more.\n\nTo note, QuoIntelligence was not able to determine if the information contained in the file is legitimate or not.\n\nOne of the hypotheses explaining the corrupted file is an intentional tactic of the attacker. The rationale could be\nthat the attacker makes the user attempt to first open the XLS file, and then open the .exe with the same filename\nas a second try. The .exe file has a PDF icon, so if file extensions are not shown, targeted users might be lured\ninto opening the executable.\n\n**File Name** Course 5 – 16 October 2020.exe\n\n**SHA256** **aac3b1221366cf7e4421bdd555d0bc33d4b92d6f65fa58c1bb4d8474db883fec**\n\n\n**First**\n**Submission**\n**to VT**\n\n\n2020-08-05T18:33:39\n\n\n-----\n\n**File Name** Course 5 – 16 October 2020.exe\n\n\n**First AV**\n**detection**\n**rate**\n\n\nReally Low (9/70)\n\n\n[The sample analyzed is a Delphi executable. Since 2015, multiple](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/24/sednit-update-analysis-zebrocy/) [researchers have already covered Zebrocy](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-sofacy-groups-parallel-attacks/)\nDelphi versions in-depth. Interestingly, last Zebrocy [observations seemed to suggest a discontinuity of the Delphi](https://securelist.com/zebrocys-multilanguage-malware-salad/90680/)\n[versions in favor of a new one written in Go language.](https://securelist.com/a-zebrocy-go-downloader/89419/)\n\n## Behavior Analysis\n\nOnce executed, the sample copies itself into %AppData%\\Roaming\\Service\\12345678\\sqlservice.exe by adding\n160 random bytes to the new file. This padding is used to evade hash-matching security controls, since the\ndropped malware will always have a different file hash value.\n\nNext, the malware creates a new scheduled task, and it is executed with the /s parameter\n\nThe task runs regularly and tries to POST stolen data (e.g. screenshots) to hxxp://194.32.78[.]245/protect/get-updid[.]php\n\nAt a first glance, the data seems to be obfuscated and encrypted. Another request looks like this:\n\nThe heading number 12345678 (the original eight digits were redacted) seems to be constant, suggesting its use\nas a unique ID of the infected machine. Notably, the same number is also used by the malware while creating the\nfolder that contains sqlservice.exe\n\nLetting the sample talk to its actual C2 on the Internet did not change its actual behavior during our analysis. The\nmalware sends POST requests about once per minute without getting a response back. Additionally, the server\ncloses the connection after waiting for about 10 more seconds. It is possible that this unresponsive behavior is due\n\n\n-----\n\nto the C2 determining the infected machine as not interesting.\n\nLastly, the network traffic generated to the C2 triggers the following Emerging Threats (ET) IDS rule:\n\nET TROJAN Zebrocy Screenshot Upload” (SID: 2030122)\n\n## Victimology and Attribution\n\nQuoIntelligence concludes with medium-high confidence that the campaign targeted a specific government body,\n_at_ _least in Azerbaijan. Although Azerbaijan is not a NATO member, it closely cooperates with the North-Atlantic_\norganizations and participates in NATO exercises. Further, the same campaign very likely targeted other NATO\nmembers or countries cooperating with NATO exercises.\n\nBy analyzing the Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), the targeting, and the theme used as a lure, we\nhave high confidence in attributing this attack to the well-known APT28/Zebrocy TTPs disclosed by the security\ncommunity in the last year.\n\n## An Interesting Coincidence?\n\nAlthough we could not find any strong causation link yet or solid technical link between the two attacks, it should\n[be noted the following points correlating with the ReconHellcat campaign we uncovered on August 11:](https://quointelligence.eu/2020/08/blackwater-malware-leveraging-beirut-tragedy-in-new-targeted-campaign/)\n\nBoth the compressed Zebrocy malware and the OSCE-themed lure used to drop the BlackWater backdoor\nwere uploaded the same day, on 5 August.\nBoth samples were uploaded by the same user in Azerbaijan and are highly likely by the same organization.\nBoth attacks happened in the same timeframe.\nOSCE and NATO are both organizations that have been targeted (directly or indirectly) by APT28 in the past.\nThe victimology we identified for the ReconHellcat campaign is in line with the one targeted by the Zebrocy\nattack (i.e. similar type of government bodies). The type of organizations targeted by both attacks is also in\nline with known APT28 victimology.\nWe assessed ReconHellcat as a high-capability APT group, like APT28.\n\n## Citations\n\n[[1] ESET, A1, April 2018, Sednit update: Analysis of Zebrocy](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/24/sednit-update-analysis-zebrocy/)\n\n[2] Palo Alto, B1, June 2018, [Sofacy Group’s Parallel Attacks](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-sofacy-groups-parallel-attacks/)\n\n[3] Kaspersky, A1, October 2018, [Shedding Skin – Turla’s Fresh Faces](https://securelist.com/shedding-skin-turlas-fresh-faces/88069/)\n\n[[4] Kaspersky, A1, Janurary 2019, A Zebrocy Go Downloader](https://securelist.com/a-zebrocy-go-downloader/89419/)\n\n[[5] Kaspersky, A1, January 2019, GreyEnergy’s overlap with Zebrocy](https://securelist.com/greyenergys-overlap-with-zebrocy/89506/)\n\n[6] Kaspersky, A1, June 2019, [Zebrocy’s Multilanguage Malware](https://securelist.com/zebrocys-multilanguage-malware-salad/90680/)\n\n## Appendix I – IOCs\n\nhxxp://194.32.78.245/protect/get-upd-id.php\n\n\n-----\n\n**Course 5 16 October 2020.zipx**\n\n6e89e098816f3d353b155ab0f3377fe3eb3951f45f8c34c4a48c5b61cd8425aa\n\n**Course 5 – 16 October 2020.xls (Corrupted file)**\n\nb45dc885949d29cba06595305923a0ed8969774dae995f0ce5b947b5ab5fe185\n\n**Course 5 – 16 October 2020.exe (Zebrocy malware)**\n\naac3b1221366cf7e4421bdd555d0bc33d4b92d6f65fa58c1bb4d8474db883fec\n\n**Additional Zebrocy malware variants on VT**\n\nfae335a465bb9faac24c58304a199f3bf9bb1b0bd07b05b18e2be6b9e90d72e6\n\neb81c1be62f23ac7700c70d866e84f5bc354f88e6f7d84fd65374f84e252e76b\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK\n\n**TACTIC** **TECHNIQUE**\n\n\n**Execution**\n\n\n[T1047: Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/)\n\n\n**Defense Evasion** [T1140: Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140/)\n\n**Discovery** [T1083: File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/) T1135: Network Share\nDiscovery\n\n[T1120: Peripheral Device Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1120/)\n\n[T1057: Process Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1057/)\n\n[T1012: Query Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012/) T1082: System\nInformation Discovery\n\n[T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/) T1049: System Network\nConnections Discovery\n\n[T1033: System Owner/User Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033/) T1124: System Time\nDiscovery\n\n**Collection** [T1560: Archive Collected Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/)\n\n[T1119: Automated Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119/)\n\n[T1113: Screen Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1113/)\n\n\n**Command and**\n**Control**\n\n\n[T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/)\n\n\n**Exfiltration** [T1041: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/)\n\nDo you want to stay informed of cyber and geopolitical threats targeting your organization?
