WLAN\ntechnologies are based on the IEEE 802.11 standard and its amendments.[1] The fundamental components\nof an IEEE 802.11 WLAN (hereafter referred to as a “WLAN” in this publication) are client devices, such\nas laptops and smartphones, and access points (APs), which logically connect client devices with a\ndistribution system, typically the organization’s wired network infrastructure. Some WLANs also use\nwireless switches, which act as intermediaries between APs and the distribution system.\n\nThe security of each WLAN is heavily dependent on how well each WLAN component—including client\ndevices, APs, and wireless switches—is secured throughout the WLAN lifecycle, from initial WLAN\ndesign and deployment through ongoing maintenance and monitoring. Unfortunately, WLANs are\ntypically less secure than their wired counterparts for several reasons, including the ease of access to the\nWLAN and the weak security configurations often used for WLANs (to favor convenience over security).\nThe purpose of this publication is to help organizations improve their WLAN security by providing\nrecommendations for WLAN security configuration and monitoring. This publication supplements other\nNIST publications by consolidating and strengthening their key recommendations.\n\nOrganizations should implement the following guidelines to improve the security of their WLANs.\n\n**Have standardized security configurations for common WLAN components, such as client devices**\n**and APs.**\n\nA standardized configuration provides a base level of security, reducing vulnerabilities and lessening the\nimpact of successful attacks. Standardized configurations can also significantly reduce the time and effort\nneeded to secure WLAN components and verify their security, particularly if the configuration can be\ndeployed and verified through automated means.\n\n**When planning WLAN security, consider the security not only of the WLAN itself, but also how it**\n**may affect the security of other networks.**\n\nA WLAN is usually connected to an organization’s wired networks, and WLANs may also be connected\nto each other. For WLANs that need wired network access, their client devices should be allowed access\nonly to the necessary hosts on the wired network using only the required protocols. Also, an organization\nshould have separate WLANs if there is more than one security profile for WLAN usage; for example, an\norganization should have logically separated WLANs for external use (such as guests) and internal use.\nDevices on one WLAN should not be able to connect to devices on a logically separated WLAN.\n\n**Have policies that clearly state which forms of dual connections are permitted or prohibited for**\n**WLAN client devices, and enforce these policies through the appropriate security controls.**\n\nThe term “dual connected” generally refers to a client device that is connected to both a wired network\nand a WLAN at the same time. If an attacker gains unauthorized wireless access to a dual-connected\nclient device, the attacker could then use it to access or attack resources on the wired network.\nOrganizations should consider the risks posed not only by the traditional form of dual connectness, but\nalso by other forms involving multiple wireless networks. It is common today for client devices to be\nconnected to multiple wireless networks simultaneously, such as cell phone, WiMAX, Bluetooth, and\nWLAN networks. Organizations should assess the risk of the possible combinations of network\n\n1 See [GAO-11-43] for additional information on the history of the IEEE 802.11 standard for WLANs.\n\n\n-----\n\nGUIDELINES FOR SECURING WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)\n\ntechnologies for their WLAN client devices and determine how those risks should be mitigated. If one or\nmore of the networks cannot have its risk mitigated to an acceptable level, then dual connections\ninvolving that network may pose too much risk to the organization and may need to be prohibited.\n\n**Ensure that the organization’s WLAN client devices and APs have configurations at all times that**\n**are compliant with the organization’s WLAN policies.**\n\nAfter designing WLAN security configurations for client devices and APs, an organization should\ndetermine how the configurations will be implemented, evaluate the effectiveness of the implementations,\ndeploy the implementations to the appropriate devices, and maintain the configurations and their\nimplementations throughout the devices’ lifecycles. Organizations should standardize, automate, and\ncentralize as much of their WLAN security configuration implementation and maintenance as practical.\nThis allows organizations to implement consistent WLAN security throughout the enterprise, to detect\nand correct unauthorized changes to configurations, and to react quickly when newly identified\nvulnerabilities or recent incidents indicate a need to change the WLAN’s security configuration.\n\n**Perform both attack monitoring and vulnerability monitoring to support WLAN security.**\n\nSecurity monitoring is important for all systems and networks, but it is generally even more important for\nWLANs because of the increased risks that they face. Organizations should continuously monitor their\nWLANs for both WLAN-specific and general (wired network) attacks. Organizations should do largely\nthe same vulnerability monitoring for WLAN components that they do for any other software: identifying\npatches and applying them, and verifying security configuration settings and adjusting them as needed.\nThese actions should be performed at least as often for WLAN components as they are for the\norganization’s equivalent wired systems.\n\n**Conduct regular periodic technical security assessments for the organization’s WLANs.**\n\nThese assessments should be performed at least annually to evaluate the overall security of the WLAN. In\naddition, organizations should perform periodic assessments at least quarterly unless continuous\nmonitoring of WLAN security is already collecting all of the necessary information about WLAN attacks\nand vulnerabilities needed for assessment purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\nGUIDELINES FOR SECURING WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)\n\n\n###### 1.

WLAN Security Configuration\n\n\nWireless networking enables computing devices with wireless capabilities to use computing resources\nwithout being physically connected to a network. The devices simply need to be within a certain distance\n(known as the range) of the wireless network infrastructure. Wireless local area networks (WLANs) are\ngroups of wireless networking devices within a limited geographic area, such as an office building, that\nare capable of exchanging data through radio communications. WLANs are usually implemented as\nextensions to existing wired local area networks (LANs) to provide enhanced user mobility and network\naccess. WLAN technologies are based on the IEEE 802.11 standard and its amendments. Throughout the\nrest of this publication, the generic term “WLAN” refers to an IEEE 802.11 WLAN.\n\nThe two fundamental types of WLAN components are client devices (such as laptops and smartphones)\nand access points (APs), which logically connect client devices with a distribution system (DS), typically\nthe organization’s wired network infrastructure. The DS is the means by which client devices can\ncommunicate with the organization’s wired LANs and external networks such as the Internet. Some\nWLANs also use wireless switches, which act as intermediaries between APs and the DS. The purpose of\nthe switch is to assist administrators in managing the WLAN infrastructure. Figure 1 shows a simplified\nview of WLAN components that includes a wireless switch. WLANs without wireless switches have a\nsimilar architecture, except that the APs connect directly to the DS.\n\n##### AP\n\n Wireless DS\n Switch\n\n AP AP\n\n**Figure 1: Simplified View of WLAN Architecture**\n\nThe security of each of the WLAN components—including client devices, APs, and wireless switches—is\nheavily dependent on their WLAN security configuration. This section explains why having standardized\nsecurity configurations is important for WLAN components and provides recommendations for\ndesigning, implementing, evaluating, and maintaining those configurations, particularly for client devices.\n\n\n##### Wireless\n\n\n##### DS\n\n\n-----\n\nGUIDELINES FOR SECURING WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)\n\nAs explained in Section 1.2, the recommendations presented in this section supplement those provided for\nspecific WLAN technologies by other NIST publications [SP800-48, SP800-97].\n\nThis section does not provide an exhaustive explanation of the entire security configuration lifecycle;\nrather, it highlights a few topics of particular relevance to WLAN security. Section 2.1 discusses security\nconfiguration design, while Section 2.2 focuses on security configuration implementation, evaluation, and\nmaintenance.\n\n**2.1** **Configuration Design**\n\nOrganizations should have standardized security configurations for their common WLAN components,\nsuch as client devices and APs. A standardized configuration provides a base level of security, reducing\nvulnerabilities and lessening the impact of successful attacks. Standardized configuration use improves\nthe consistency and predictability of security, in conjunction with user training and awareness activities\nand other supporting security controls. Standardized configurations can also provide a large resource\nsavings by reducing the time needed to secure each WLAN device and to verify its configuration for\nsecurity assessments, audits, etc., particularly if the configuration can be deployed and verified through\nautomated means.\n\nThis section focuses on two noteworthy aspects of configuration design: gathering needs and designing\nWLAN architectures.\n\n**2.1.1 Needs Gathering**\n\nBefore designing a WLAN security architecture or WLAN component security configurations, an\norganization should gather information on needs, particularly operational and security related ones. This\nshould include identifying relevant WLAN security requirements from applicable laws, policies,\nregulations, etc. For Federal agencies, this often includes requirements from OMB, the Government\nAccountability Office (GAO), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and other agencies. Another\npart of needs gathering is identifying and reviewing recommended WLAN security practices from Federal\nagencies (e.g., NIST Special Publications, DISA Security Technical Implementation Guides), WLAN\nvendors, and other parties [NCP]. See Section 9 of [SP800-94] for examples of possible requirements to\ninclude in needs gathering.\n\nIn addition to identifying these requirements and recommendations, organizations should also determine\nwhat threats their WLAN security faces. Organizations should conduct risk assessments to identify the\nthreats against their WLANs and determine the effectiveness of existing security controls in counteracting\nthe threats; they then should perform risk mitigation to decide what additional measures (if any) should be\nimplemented, as discussed in [SP800-37]. Performing risk assessments and mitigation helps organizations\ndecide how their WLANs should be secured. See Section 3.1 for an overview of common WLAN threats.\n\n**2.1.2 WLAN Architecture**\n\nWhen planning WLAN security, configuration designers should consider the security not only of the\nWLAN itself, but also how it may affect other networks that are accessible through it, such as internal\nwired networks reachable from the WLAN. An important principle of WLAN security is to separate\nWLANs with different security profiles. For example, there should be separate WLANs for external\n(guest, etc.) and internal use. Devices on an organization’s external WLAN should not be able to connect\nthrough that WLAN to devices on another of the organization’s WLANs. This helps to protect the\norganization’s other networks and devices from external devices and users. Organizations often set up\nexternal WLANs primarily to provide Internet access to visitors; such WLANs should be architected so\n\n\n-----\n\nGUIDELINES FOR SECURING WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)\n\nthat their traffic does not traverse the organization’s internal networks. For external WLANs that do need\ninternal network access, WLAN client devices should be allowed access only to the necessary hosts or\nsubnets using only the required protocols.\n\nAnother architectural issue mentioned in the WLAN reference architecture document and discussed in\nmore detail in [GAO-11-43] is dual connected client devices. The term “dual connected” generally refers\nto a device that is connected to both a wired network and a WLAN at the same time. The primary concern\nwith dual connected configurations is that an attacker may be able to gain unauthorized wireless access to\nthe client device and then use it to attack resources on the wired network. Essentially this is allowing an\nattacker to exploit a lower-security network in order to gain access to a higher-security network. One\npossible scenario is an attacker tunneling traffic from the higher-security network to the lower-security\nnetwork through the client device instead of following the intended network architecture, and thus\navoiding network-based security controls intended for the higher-security network. Dual connected\nconfigurations also generally violate the principle of disabling unneeded network services to reduce attack\nsurface; if the device is already connected to a wired network access, WLAN access is usually redundant.\n\nOrganizations should not only consider simultaneous wired network and WLAN use, but other forms of\ndual connectedness involving their WLAN client devices. With the increasing variety and popularity of\nwireless networking technologies, it is common today for devices to be connected to multiple wireless\nnetworks simultaneously. For example, most smartphones can use cell phone networks, WLANs, and\nBluetooth networks simultaneously, while they are also connected to wired laptops/desktops (and\npossibly their wired networks) through a cabled connection (e.g., USB). It is also increasingly common\nfor laptops to have multiple wireless interfaces, such as both WLAN and WiMAX interfaces, or to be\nconfigured to accept removable media-based WLAN interfaces. A single laptop with multiple WLAN\ninterfaces could have simultaneous connections to multiple WLANs, such as an organization WLAN and\nan external WLAN.\n\nOrganizations should assess the risk of the possible combinations of network technologies for their\nWLAN client devices and determine how those risks should be mitigated. This does not mean that all\nforms of dual connectedness should automatically be prohibited; examples of use cases that are often\npermitted include a smartphone attaching to both a WLAN and a Bluetooth-networked earbud\nsimultaneously, and a laptop attaching to both a WLAN and a Bluetooth-networked keyboard and mouse\nsimultaneously. However, the security of such use cases is largely dependent on the security of all of the\nnetworks. If one or more of the networks cannot have its risk mitigated to an acceptable level, then dual\nconnections involving that network may pose too much risk to the organization and may need to be\nprohibited. The primary risk-related issue to be considered is the likelihood of an attacker accessing and\nmanipulating legitimate communications and the possible and typical impact of such an attack.\n\nOrganizations should have policies that clearly state which forms of dual connections are permitted or\nprohibited for their WLAN client devices under various circumstances. Organizations should enforce\nthese policies through the appropriate security controls, including the actions listed below:\n\n  - For all their WLAN client devices: disable all network interfaces that are not authorized for any\nuse (including during contingency plans for business continuity, disaster recovery, etc.), and\nconfigure the device so that the user cannot enable them or otherwise circumvent the restrictions.\n\n  - For all their WLAN client devices not authorized for dual connections:\n\n`o` Implement the appropriate technical security controls (discussed below the bullets) so that all\n\ndual connected configurations are prohibited.\n\n\n-----\n\nGUIDELINES FOR SECURING WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)\n\n`o` If feasible, configure the devices to disable bridging (passing traffic between the networks).\n\nThis is precautionary in case an unauthorized dual connection occurs.\n\n  - For all their WLAN client devices authorized for dual connections:\n\n`o` Implement the appropriate technical security controls (discussed below the bullets) so that the\n\nauthorized dual connected configurations are only active when necessary and that all other\ndual connected configurations are prohibited.\n\n`o` Configure the devices to disable bridging (passing traffic between the networks) unless\n\nabsolutely necessary.\n\nThere are several options for implementing WLAN client device dual connection policies, such as\nprohibiting unauthorized configurations from being used and disabling authorized dual connections when\nnot needed. To enforce such restrictions, organizations should rely on automated technical controls\nwhenever feasible. Non-technical controls are usually not effective enough; for example, it is generally\nnot feasible to rely on users to remember to always promptly disable WLAN interfaces every time they\nare no longer needed. Each organization should evaluate the possible controls for implementing dual\nconnection policies on their WLAN client devices and then choose the combinations of controls that are\nmost appropriate, providing sufficient security while also permitting necessary functionality.\n\nSome of the possible controls are preventative (implementing and enforcing a configuration), while others\nare detective (monitoring a configuration, monitoring network activity, alerting when a problem is\ndetected, etc.) Preventative controls are generally preferable to detective controls, but it is even stronger\nto use both preventative and detective controls together. See Section 3 for more information on\nmonitoring (detective) controls.\n\nPreventative controls may need to enforce granular policies. For example, an organization might permit\nonly wired network usage while at their headquarters, but might permit wired or wireless access to\nexternal networks. Preventative controls may also need to provide flexibility; organizations often need to\nallow users to attach the organization’s mobile client devices to new external WLANs, and thus the users\nneed some ability to manage their devices’ WLAN configuration.\n\nExamples of preventative controls include the following:\n\n  - Configure the device’s BIOS so that WLAN connections are automatically terminated when a\nwired connection is detected. The BIOS setting for this is often called LAN/WLAN switching.\n\n  - Enable specialized software-based controls that permit either WLAN or wired network access,\nbut not both simultaneously. These controls could be built into the operating system (OS),\nprovided as part of the WLAN driver or management software, provided by the device\nmanufacturer (e.g., laptop vendor), or acquired from third parties. These controls typically favor\nwired connections over WLAN because of their relative reliability, performance, and security.\n\n  - Configure host-based network security tools (e.g., host-based firewalls, host-based intrusion\ndetection and prevention systems) to prevent multiple network interfaces from being used at one\ntime.\n\n  - Specify and enforce authorized network profiles and/or unauthorized profiles through OS/domain\ncontrols, third party policy-based software, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\nGUIDELINES FOR SECURING WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)\n\nThere are other technical WLAN security controls, such as configuring clients so that they will not\nautomatically connect to any WLANs they detect, that are beneficial for WLAN security but not robust\nenough to prevent dual connections.\n\n**2.2** **Configuration Implementation, Evaluation, and Maintenance**\n\nAfter designing a WLAN security configuration, an organization should determine how the configuration\nwill be implemented, evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation, deploy the implementation to the\nappropriate devices, and maintain the configuration and its implementation throughout the devices’\nlifecycles. Organizations should ensure that their WLAN client devices and APs have configurations at all\ntimes that are compliant with the organization’s WLAN policies.\n\nOrganizations should standardize, automate, and centralize as much of their WLAN security\nconfiguration implementation and maintenance as practical, particularly for their WLAN client devices\nand access points. This allows organizations to implement consistent WLAN security throughout the\nenterprise, to detect and correct unauthorized changes to configurations, and to react quickly when newly\nidentified vulnerabilities or recent incidents indicate a need to change the WLAN’s security configuration.\n\nOrganizations can often leverage existing configuration management solutions for their WLAN security\nconfiguration management. Many organizations already have general configuration management\nsolutions in place that can handle a wide variety of software; such solutions may be built into operating\nsystems or provided through third-party software installed on their client devices and other WLAN\ncomponents. Also, WLAN client management software often has configuration management capabilities;\nthis software may already be installed on the WLAN devices. If the existing configuration management\nsolutions cannot collectively provide the necessary WLAN configuration implementation and\nmaintenance capabilities, then the organization should evaluate alternatives and implement a suitable\nconfiguration management solution that provides the missing capabilities.\n\nOrganizations should evaluate all standardized WLAN security configuration implementations carefully\nbefore deploying them throughout production environments. Even if the organization is confident that the\nconfiguration is sound, it should still be evaluated carefully to ensure that its implementation meets the\norganization’s particular security and operational requirements. Every operating environment has unique\ncharacteristics that should be taken into account. It is particularly important to evaluate the strength of the\nconfiguration and its potential impacts on performance and functionality (for example, a security setting\nthat is incompatible with use of a particular application).\n\n\n-----\n\nGUIDELINES FOR SECURING WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)\n\n\n###### 3. WLAN Security Monitoring\n\n\nThis section discusses two types of security monitoring: assessments [SP800-115, SP800-53A] and\ncontinuous monitoring. Security assessment is “the process of determining how effectively an entity\nbeing assessed meets specific security objectives.” Security assessments are typically performed\nperiodically, such as annually or quarterly, and are often called periodic assessments. Continuous\nmonitoring is defined in [SP800-137] as “maintaining ongoing awareness of information security,\nvulnerabilities, and threats to support organizational risk management decisions. The objective is to\nconduct ongoing monitoring of the security of an organization’s networks, information, and systems, and\nrespond by accepting, avoiding/rejecting, transferring/sharing, or mitigating risk as situations change.”\nThink of continuous monitoring as doing assessments in near real-time, so that the organization can react\nto problems in minutes instead of months or years.\n\nFor WLAN security, the same tools are often useful for both periodic assessments and continuous\nmonitoring. These forms of monitoring are used to ensure that each WLAN component’s security\nconfiguration meets the organization’s requirements (and to report all deviations from these\nrequirements), as well as to monitor WLAN activity to identify attacks, improperly secured\ncommunications, and other WLAN security issues. This section provides recommendations for WLAN\nsecurity monitoring (both periodic assessments and continuous monitoring).\n\nAs explained in Section 1.2, the recommendations presented in this section supplement those provided for\nspecific WLAN technologies by other NIST publications [SP800-48, SP800-97], as well as NIST\npublications on general security assessment [SP800-115, SP800-53A] and continuous monitoring [SP800137].\n\n**3.1** **WLAN Security Monitoring Basics**\n\nSecurity monitoring is important for all systems and networks, but it is generally even more important for\nWLANs. WLANs and wired networks have the same security objectives and face the same general types\nof threats, but WLAN security is typically harder to achieve for several reasons.\n\nFirst, WLANs tend to be easier for attackers to access than wired networks. The most significant\ndifference between protecting WLANs and wired networks is the relative ease of intercepting wireless\nnetwork transmissions and inserting new or altered transmissions from what is presumed to be the\nauthentic source. To monitor traffic on a wired network, an attacker would have to gain physical access to\nthe network or remotely compromise systems on the network; for a WLAN, an attacker simply needs to\nbe within range of the wireless transmissions. (Some attackers use highly sensitive directional antennas,\nwhich can greatly extend the effective range of attack beyond the standard WLAN range.)\n\nSecond, WLANs are often poorly secured. For example, many WLANs are configured so that they do not\nrequire strong authentication; this makes it much easier, sometimes trivial, for attackers within range of\nthe WLAN to successfully gain access to it. These configurations are often used because they are more\nconvenient for users and administrators, but they often put the transmitted information and WLAN\ndevices at serious risk of compromise.\n\nThird, WLANs are usually connected to an organization’s wired networks. This means that the WLANs\nand WLAN devices are not only subject to WLAN-specific attacks, but also nearly all the attacks that\nwired networks and devices on those networks face.\n\nTo support WLAN security, organizations should perform both attack monitoring and vulnerability\nmonitoring. Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 provide more information on these, respectively.\n\n\n-----\n\nGUIDELINES FOR SECURING WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)\n\n**3.1.1 Attack Monitoring**\n\nOrganizations should continuously monitor their WLANs for both WLAN-specific and general (wired\nnetwork) attacks. The latter involves the same security controls as would be used for any networkconnected system in an organization; see [SP800-53] for additional information on general system\nsecurity and [SP800-94] for general information on attack detection technologies. Further discussion of\ngeneral (non-wireless) attack monitoring is out of the scope of this publication.\n\nWLAN-specific attacks can typically be divided into two types: passive and active. These attack classes,\nwhich are significant for monitoring purposes, are described below.\n\n  - **Passive attack: an attack in which an unauthorized party only monitors WLAN communications;**\nthe attacker does not generate, alter, or disrupt WLAN communications. There are two types of\npassive attacks:\n\n`o` **Eavesdropping. The attacker monitors WLAN data transmissions for message content.**\n\n`o` **Traffic analysis (also known as traffic flow analysis). The attacker gains intelligence by**\n\nmonitoring the transmissions for patterns of communication. A considerable amount of\ninformation is contained in the flow of messages between communicating parties.\n\n  - **Active attack: an attack in which an unauthorized party generates, alters, or disrupts WLAN**\ncommunications. Active attacks may take the form of one of the following types:\n\n`o` **Masquerading. The attacker impersonates an authorized user to gain access to certain**\n\nunauthorized privileges.\n\n`o` **Replay. The attacker monitors transmissions (passive attack) and retransmits messages**\n\nposing as the legitimate user.\n\n`o` **Message modification. The attacker alters a legitimate message by deleting, adding to,**\n\nchanging, or reordering the message.\n\n`o` **Denial of service (DoS). A DoS can occur inadvertently, such as other electronic devices**\n\ncausing interference, or it can occur intentionally, such as an attacker sending large numbers\nof messages at a high rate to flood the WLAN.\n\n`o` **Misappropriation. The attacker steals or makes other unauthorized use of WLAN services.**\n\nA form of active attack that is particularly noteworthy is the deployment of rogue WLAN devices. For\nexample, an attacker deploys an AP that has been configured to appear as part of an organization’s\nWLAN infrastructure. This can provide a backdoor into the wired network, bypassing perimeter security\nmechanisms, such as firewalls. In addition, if client devices inadvertently connect to the rogue AP, the\nattacker can view and manipulate the client devices’ communications (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks), as\nwell as potentially gaining access to the client devices themselves.\n\nMonitoring WLAN-specific attacks is focused on active attacks. Because passive attacks strictly involve\nintercepting radio transmissions and do not generate their own transmissions, there is nothing for an\norganization to monitor electronically. However, all forms of active attack mentioned above can be\ndetected through monitoring. Section 3.2 discusses tools that can monitor for active attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nGUIDELINES FOR SECURING WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)\n\n**3.1.2 Vulnerability Monitoring**\n\nOrganizations should do largely the same vulnerability monitoring for WLAN components that they do\nfor any other software: identifying patches and applying them, and verifying security configuration\nsettings and adjusting them as needed (see Section 2). These actions should be performed at least as often\nfor WLAN components as they are for the organization’s equivalent wired systems. Further discussion of\nthese general vulnerability monitoring techniques is outside the scope of this publication.\n\nIn addition to the general vulnerability monitoring, WLAN-specific vulnerability monitoring involves\nanalyzing WLAN communications and identifying policy violations, such as communications using the\nwrong protocols, encryption key lengths, etc. This is effective at identifying misconfigured WLAN\ndevices as well as devices that are acting differently than their configuration indicates. It is especially\nhelpful when not all of the WLAN devices are under the organization’s control, such as visitor laptops,\nand when unauthorized WLAN devices are a concern (e.g., an employee attaching a personal mobile\ndevice to an organization WLAN without authorization). This form of vulnerability monitoring is often\nprovided by the same tools that are effective at attack monitoring, as explained in Section 3.2.\n\n**3.2** **Monitoring Tools**\n\nOne of the primary tools for WLAN security monitoring is a wireless intrusion detection and prevention\nsystem (WIDPS). A WIDPS has sensors placed at designated locations within an organization’s facilities;\nthese sensors monitor WLAN bands and channels to sample traffic, allowing them to identify WLAN\nattacks and some WLAN vulnerabilities. WIDPS sensors are available in several forms:\n\n  - **Dedicated. A dedicated sensor performs WIDPS functions but does not pass network traffic from**\nsource to destination. Dedicated sensors are often completely passive, simply sniffing WLAN\ntraffic. Some dedicated sensors analyze the traffic they monitor, while other sensors forward the\ntraffic to a management server for analysis. The sensor is typically connected to a wired network.\nDedicated sensors are usually designed for one of two deployment types:\n\n`o` **Fixed—the sensor is deployed to a particular location. Fixed sensors usually depend on the**\n\norganization’s infrastructure for power, wired network access, and other resources.\n\n`o` **Mobile—the sensor is designed to be portable so it can be used from multiple locations or**\n\nwhile in motion. For example, a security administrator could use a mobile sensor while\nwalking through an organization’s buildings to find rogue APs.\n\n  - **Bundled. Many APs and wireless switches offer some WIDPS capabilities as a secondary**\nfunction.\n\nIn addition to these hardware-based forms, there are also host-based WIDPS sensor software products that\ncan be installed on WLAN client devices. The sensor software detects WLAN attacks within range of the\nclient device, as well as WLAN vulnerabilities of the client device, and reports this information to\nWIDPS management servers. The sensor software may also be able to enforce WLAN security policies.\nSee [SP800-94] for more information on all forms of WIDPS.\n\nAnother primary tool for WLAN security monitoring is a WLAN scanner. A passive WLAN scanning\ntool captures WLAN traffic being transmitted within the range of the tool’s antenna. Most passive tools\nrecord the key attributes of discovered WLAN devices. This information can be used to identify WLAN\nvulnerabilities and to detect potential rogue devices. WLAN scanning tools used to conduct completely\npassive scans transmit no data, nor do the tools in any way affect the operation of deployed WLAN\n\n\n-----\n\nGUIDELINES FOR SECURING WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)\n\ndevices. By not transmitting data, a passive scanning tool remains undetected by malicious users and\nother devices. This reduces the likelihood of individuals avoiding detection by disconnecting or disabling\nunauthorized WLAN devices.\n\nThere are also active WLAN scanning tools. Building on the information collected during passive scans,\nactive scanning attempts to attach to discovered WLAN devices and conduct penetration or vulnerabilityrelated testing. Organizations should be cautious in conducting active scans to make sure they do not\ninadvertently scan devices owned or operated by other organizations or individuals within range. It is\nimportant to evaluate the physical location of devices before actively scanning them. Generally,\norganizations should focus on identifying and locating potential rogue devices rather than performing\nactive scans of such devices.\n\nThe types of tools mentioned in this section are examples of tools that are often effective at WLAN\nsecurity monitoring. This is not intended to imply that no other types of tools may also be useful at\nWLAN security monitoring. What is important is having the necessary monitoring capabilities, not the\nlabels applied to the tool or tools providing those capabilities.\n\n**3.3** **Continuous Monitoring Recommendations**\n\nOrganizations with WLANs should implement continuous monitoring solutions for their WLANs that\nprovide all of the following detection capabilities:\n\n  - Unauthorized WLAN devices, including rogue APs and unauthorized client devices\n\n  - WLAN devices that are misconfigured or using weak WLAN protocols and protocol\nimplementations\n\n  - Unusual WLAN usage patterns, such as extremely high numbers of client devices using a\nparticular AP, abnormally high volumes of WLAN traffic involving a particular client device, or\nmany failed attempts to join the WLAN in a short period of time\n\n  - The use of active WLAN scanners (e.g., war driving tools) that generate WLAN traffic. The use\nof passive sensors cannot be detected through monitoring controls.\n\n  - DoS attacks and conditions (e.g., network interference). Many denial of service attacks are\ndetected by counting events during periods of time and alerting when threshold values are\nexceeded. For example, a large number of events involving the termination of WLAN sessions\ncan indicate a DoS attack.\n\n  - Impersonation and man-in-the-middle attacks. For example, some WIDPS sensors can detect\nwhen a device is attempting to spoof the identity of another device.\n\nOrganizations with WLANs should also have the capability to identify the physical location of a detected\nWLAN threat by using triangulation—estimating the threat’s approximate distance from multiple sensors\nby the strength of the threat’s signal received by each sensor, then calculating the physical location at\nwhich the threat would be the estimated distance from each sensor. This allows an organization to send\nappropriate personnel, such as physical security staff, to the location to address the threat.\n\n\n-----\n\nGUIDELINES FOR SECURING WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)\n\n**3.4** **Periodic Assessment Recommendations**\n\nOrganizations with WLANs should conduct regular periodic technical WLAN security assessments.\nThese assessments should be performed at least annually to evaluate the overall security of the WLAN. In\naddition, organizations should perform periodic assessments at least quarterly unless continuous\nmonitoring of WLAN security is already collecting all of the information about WLAN attacks and\nvulnerabilities needed for assessment purposes. For example, an organization that does not have\ncomprehensive WIDPS coverage of its facilities should use mobile WIDPS sensors, WLAN scanners, or\nother tools with similar capabilities to search for rogue WLANs in areas outside the WIDPS’s range.\n\nThe following are additional factors that organizations should consider when planning the frequency and\nbreadth of periodic assessments:\n\n  - The location of the facility being scanned, because the physical proximity of a building to a\npublic area (e.g., streets and public common areas) or its location in a busy metropolitan area may\nincrease the risk of WLAN threats\n\n  - The security level of the data to be transmitted on the WLAN\n\n  - How often WLAN client devices connect to and disconnect from the environment, and the typical\ntraffic levels for these devices (e.g., occasional activity or fairly constant activity)—this is\nbecause only active WLAN client devices are discoverable during a WLAN scan\n\n  - Physical changes to the facilities, such as construction projects that could affect the strength and\npropagation of WLAN signals\n\n\n-----\n\nGUIDELINES FOR SECURING WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS
