Linux/Moose\ninfects devices in order to use them as proxies to relay traffic to\nsocial networks. Its architecture includes a whitelist of IP\naddresses that can push traffic through those proxies – a feature\nreminiscent of a reseller model. We analyse the traffic\nfingerprints left by each IP address on the systems we infected\nand uncover the value of the whitelisted IPs, which is not what\nwe had anticipated. Then, we collect information on bulk\nreseller panels, the direct working partners of the botnet\noperators. While analysing their striking similarities, we\ndiscover a new key actor in the industry: the software panel\nseller. We investigate the panels in an attempt to understand how\nthey are connected to main SMF providers like Linux/Moose.\n\nFinally, we map the SMF supply chain, discuss key actors that, if\ntargeted, would disrupt the entire industry and show the likely\nunequal revenue division in the chain. This is a first review study\nof the wholesale industry of SMF. It provides key insights for\nactors willing to curb this illicit activity, from law enforcement\nagencies to policy makers and cybersecurity professionals.\n\n#### 1. INTRODUCTION\n\nOnline social networks (OSN) have become excellent vehicles for\nmarketing, to gain visibility and subsequent influence. They have\nalso become a powerful tool for online manipulation, with\nerroneous and misleading information being widely distributed on\nthem. Among other fraudulent practices, buying fake visibility\nthrough an illicit market for social media fraud (SMF) is a\ncommon practice undertaken by many, as reported in journalistic\ninvestigations [1, 2] and studies [3–6]. Such practices seem\nbenign at first, but fortunately, law enforcement organizations\nhave started to become aware of the potential for harm they\ncreate, such as information manipulation. In January 2018, the\nNew York Attorney General launched an investigation against a\nsocial media marketing company, named Devumi, that sold SMF\nto a wide variety of customers [1, 2]. The criminal investigation\nwas set in motion since some of the fake accounts sold\n\n\nappeared to commit identity theft. Yet, there is much more\ncriminal activity behind SMF, and customer-facing companies\nlike Devumi are only the tip of the iceberg. The SMF industry\ninvolves multiple actors all contributing, to a certain degree, to\nillicit activities. This explanatory study establishes the link\nbetween these actors, from malware authors to final SMF\ncustomers, bringing key insights for law enforcement\nagencies, policy makers and cybersecurity professionals\nwilling to curb the activity of this illicit industry.\n\nTo do so, we start by presenting an Internet of Things (IoT)\nbotnet, named Linux/Moose, that conducts SMF on Instagram.\nWe study a specific feature of this main SMF provider and\nattempt to understand how orders are managed in the botnet. We\nthen investigate bulk reseller panels to uncover their middleman\nrole in this industry. Finally, we uncover the potential supply\nchain behind SMF and its key elements to disrupt the industry and\nbriefly discuss the likely unequal revenue division in the chain.\n\n#### 2. SMF BOTNET: LINUX/MOOSE AND ITS WHITELIST OF IP ADDRESSES\n\nThe production of millions of fake accounts to conduct SMF\nrequires automation, which can be done through a botnet – a\nkey actor in the SMF supply chain. Fortunately, in the past two\nyears, we have investigated such a botnet, named Linux/Moose\n\n[7]. We begin this section by briefly presenting the botnet, the\ndifferent steps we undertook to investigate its operations, and\nthe conclusions we have reached so far (with some already\npublished).\n\nLinux/Moose infects embedded Linux systems of MIPS or ARM\narchitectures, specifically avoiding x86, such as routers and IoT\ndevices. Just like other well-known IoT botnets, it has a\nworm-like behaviour, brute forcing Telnet credentials with\nsimple combinations of usernames and passwords. Its main\npayload is a proxy service that can do SOCKSv4/v5, HTTP,\nHTTPS, using the infected devices to relay traffic. This allows\nthe botnet operator(s)[1] to hide behind thousands – if not\nhundreds of thousands – of clean IP addresses[2] [3]. To study\nthe botnet’s operations, we built honeypots and infected them\nwith the Linux/Moose malware. We then accessed the\ncontent of the encrypted traffic by performing a man-in-themiddle attack using the mitmproxy tool [8]. The whole\nprocedure for the honeypots’ creation and infection, as well as\nthe man‑in‑the‑middle attack on the encrypted traffic, is detailed\nin the white paper ‘EGO MARKET: When Greed for Fame\nBenefits Large-Scale Botnets’ [3].\n\nOur analysis showed that Linux/Moose’s traffic is directed\ntowards various OSNs but mainly to Instagram, which represents\n86% of the HTTPS requests we studied.[3] On Instagram, fake\naccounts are created and then leveraged to conduct likes and\nfollows on various profiles. Cunningly, to ensure that the\nfraudulent operations are not caught by the OSN’s anti-bot\nalgorithms, human-like behaviours are scripted by the\n\n1 We do not know how many operator(s) Linux/Moose has.\n2 Reputable IP addresses, likely to be used by legitimate consumers as\nopposed to data-centre IP addresses.\n3 We use the present tense because we are fairly certain that\nLinux/Moose is still active.\n\n\n-----\n\n**MONTREAL** **WWW.VIRUSBULLETIN.COM/CONFERENCE**\n**3 – 5 October 2018**\n\n\noperator(s) [4]. During the investigation, the profiles followed by\nthe botnet were identified as belonging mainly to members of the\nentertainment industry (e.g. actors/actresses, singers,\nnewscasters/talk show hosts), small online shops and ordinary\npeople, illustrating that the demand for fake online popularity is\nvast. For further information, we published a market price\nanalysis of SMF, an evaluation of the botnet’s behaviour on\n_Instagram and a profile of the potential customers of such fraud_\nin the conference paper: ‘Can We Trust Social Media Data?\nSocial Network Manipulation by an IoT Botnet’ [4].\n\nThe element of interest in this study, which has not yet been\npublished or discussed, is the botnet’s distinct use of a whitelist\nof IP addresses. This whitelist controls who can interact with\nthe bots’ proxy and is provided in the regular beacon messages\nbetween infected hosts and the command-and-control (C&C)\nservers. Throughout our monitoring of infected hosts, the\nwhitelist remained the same, containing seven IP addresses.\nTable 1 shows where each of them is hosted.\n\n**Whitelisted** **Hoster** **Country**\n**IP addresses**\n\nIP1 CheapWindowsVPS France\n\nIP2 CheapWindowsVPS France\n\nIP3 CheapWindowsVPS France\n\nIP4 ColoCrossing United States\n\nIP5 Worldstream Netherlands\n\nIP6 Worldstream Netherlands\n\nIP7 Worldstream Netherlands\n\n_Table 1: IP hosting providers._\n\nWhile scanning these whitelisted IP addresses, we found that\nthey were Windows servers with their Remote Desktop Protocol\n(RDP) open, indicating that Linux/Moose could hypothetically\nbe built on a reseller model in which seven distinct servers – and\n\n\nthus potentially seven (or fewer) actors – could log in and use\nthe botnet’s infected devices to conduct SMF. This would be a\ngood way to delegate some control to an external actor (partner)\nwithout giving that person too much access, thus preventing the\nbotnet from being stolen. We present below the results of our\nanalysis, which does not support the reseller hypothesis, but\nrather shows a different picture. The analysis involves looking at\nthe traffic fingerprints left by each whitelisted IP address in both\nthe packet capture data (Pcaps) and the mitmproxy logs\n(decrypted HTTPS traffic) on our ten honeypots. Due to the\namount of data to process, data visualization[4] was required to\nfind patterns in the traffic. The two subsections below\nsummarize the different findings.\n\n#### 2.1 The similarities in traffic fingerprints of each whitelisted IP address\n\nThe results of the five analyses below did not confirm our\nhypothesis but rather refuted it. They show many similarities\nin the traffic fingerprints of each whitelisted IP address,\nforcing us to assume that they are probably controlled by the\nsame actor.\n\n#### 2.1.1 Honeypots used\n\nWe looked to see if each honeypot, depending on where it was\nhosted in the world, was related to a specific IP address in the\nwhitelist. However, as shown in Figure 1, we found no\ndistinctive patterns: each IP sent traffic to almost all honeypots,\nregardless of where they were hosted in the world.\n\n#### 2.1.2 TLS fingerprints\n\nWe then analysed the Transport Layer Security (TLS)\nfingerprints of each whitelisted IP address to see if different\nunderlying technologies were used by each of them. TLS\nfingerprints can be found in ‘client hello’ connections, which\nis where the connection handshake takes place between the\n\n4 Using the open source libraries Pandas and Plotly [9].\n\n|Whitelisted IP addresses|Hoster|Country|\n|---|---|---|\n|IP1|CheapWindowsVPS|France|\n|IP2|CheapWindowsVPS|France|\n|IP3|CheapWindowsVPS|France|\n|IP4|ColoCrossing|United States|\n|IP5|Worldstream|Netherlands|\n|IP6|Worldstream|Netherlands|\n|IP7|Worldstream|Netherlands|\n\n\n_Figure 1: Honeypots._\n\n\n-----\n\n#### WWW.VIRUSBULLETIN.COM/CONFERENCE MONTREAL\n**3 – 5 October 2018**\n\n_Figure 2: OSN targeted per whitelisted IP address._\n\n_Figure 3: Number of requests in time per whitelisted IP address._\n\n\nclient and the server to find the adequate cryptographic\nelements that will be used during the connection [10]. In this\nstudy, all whitelisted IP addresses used, in most of their\nconnection handshakes, the same TLS fingerprints, except\nfor one. We could not find any distinctive patterns.\nFurthermore, the TLS fingerprints were not associated with\nspecific libraries or browsers, leading us to a dead end.\n\n#### 2.1.3 Websites targeted\n\nWe probed the IP addresses from the whitelist to find out if each\nwas specialized in conducting SMF on a single OSN. Yet, as\nshown in Figure 2, no specialization was found, as each IP\naddress sent traffic to various OSNs.\n\n#### 2.1.4 User-Agents\n\nWe investigated the User-Agent component of each HTTP\nheader, thinking that each actor behind the whitelisted IP\naddresses could have used different fake User-Agents. We\nfound 3,952 different User-Agents all used by the seven\nwhitelisted IP addresses and varying in terms of browser,\n\n\nphone, library and application types. Most of the UserAgents were used in batches of a few dozen requests,\nfollowing the scripted patterns for account or friendship/like\ncreations on each OSN. We concluded that the botnet\noperator(s) are most likely using a tool to randomly spoof the\nUser-Agents in the HTTP headers and that this tool is used\nconsistently throughout all whitelisted IP addresses.\n\n#### 2.1.5 API calls\n\nFinally, we looked at the way the OSN API was used by each\nwhitelisted IP address, focusing on Instagram (the main OSN\ntargeted by Linux/Moose). We found that all IP addresses in the\nwhitelist used either the REST or the AJAX API alternatively,\nwith the same sequence of actions imitating humans, as\ndiscussed in another study we published [4]. This indicates an\nidentical modus operandi among all whitelisted IP addresses.\n\n#### 2.2 Linux/Moose’s use of the whitelist\n\nFortunately, the analysis of three key variables – timestamps,\n_Instagram accounts followed and Instagram accounts created –_\n\n\n-----\n\n**MONTREAL** **WWW.VIRUSBULLETIN.COM/CONFERENCE**\n**3 – 5 October 2018**\n\n_Figure 4: Number of requests in time per whitelisted IP address – April and May 2016._\n\n\nenlightened us as to the use of the whitelist, which is for fake\naccount management. We also found that three specific IP\naddresses were active until the end of April 2016, at which point\nthree others took over. This indicated that the operator(s) shifted\nfrom one group of active IP whitelisted addresses to another (but\nleft them all in the whitelist).\n\n#### 2.2.1 Timestamps\n\nBy graphing the requests over the whole period of study\n(approximately one year), we found that the seven IP addresses\nin the whitelist were not used at the same time during that year.\nFigure 3 shows that some whitelisted IP addresses were active\nonly at the beginning of the study, while others became active\nonly a few months later.\n\nFigure 4 depicts a zoom of Figure 3 for the months of April and\nMay 2016, illustrating that our honeypots received requests\nfrom whitelisted IP1, IP2 and IP3 until the end of April 2016,\nafter which requests were received from whitelisted IP5, IP6\nand IP7. Only IP4 was used by the botnet before and after the\nend of April 2016 for a short period of time. This grouping also\nmatches the distribution in hosting services per IP addresses\npresented in Table 1. From these findings, we could infer two\npotential events: either a change in resellers had been made or\nthere had been a shift from one group of active whitelisted IP\naddresses to another (even though all IP addresses remained in\nthe whitelist for the length of the study). The latter turned out to\nbe the most plausible, due to the analysis below.\n\n#### 2.2.2 Instagram accounts followed\n\nWe looked at the Instagram accounts followed by each IP\naddress in the whitelist and found that many requests aimed at\nfollowing a specific account were coming from more than one\nwhitelisted IP address. Moreover, we found Instagram\naccounts followed by both the whitelisted IP addresses active\nbefore the end of April 2016 and the ones that were active\n\n\nafter. This led us to conclude that the findings in the timestamp\nanalysis most likely showed a change in infrastructure from\none set of whitelisted IP addresses to another, rather than a\nchange in SMF resellers.\n\n#### 2.2.3 Instagram accounts created\n\nFinally, we investigated the fake accounts created and leveraged\nto conduct SMF and found that they did not overlap among each\nwhitelisted IP address. Indeed, each IP address in the whitelist\nhad its own unique set of fake accounts. Furthermore, a given\nfake account was consistently used through the same infected\nhost. This means that, from the point of view of Instagram, a\nfake user always connected to its network from the same IP\naddress – a usage pattern a lot more credible than bouncing\naround several IP addresses in a botnet.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the whitelisted IP addresses are running\n_Windows Server and exposing RDP for remote management._\nAlso, in the case of Instagram, although each whitelisted IP\naddress manages a set of fake accounts, there is an overlap in\nthe accounts being followed by the botnet (the potential\ncustomers of SMF). This leads us to think that a rather\nsophisticated proxy-aware Instagram fat-client is used to\nmanage the fake accounts and the flows of interaction with\n_Instagram. Confirming the exact fat-client that is used by this_\nactor will, however, require further research.\n\nThe above analysis allowed us to understand the use of the IP\naddresses in the whitelist and better clarify the botnet’s\nproduction process. We now look at other actors involved in the\nSMF supply chain: reseller panels. These actors were\ndiscovered in a previous piece of research [4] that aimed at\nprofiling the demand for SMF by investigating Instagram SMF\ncustomer profiles found in Linux/Moose’s traffic. Some of the\n_Instagram profiles followed by the botnet advertised SMF_\nreseller panels, such as http://cheapbulksocial.com/, illustrating\nthat a link exists between these two actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### WWW.VIRUSBULLETIN.COM/CONFERENCE MONTREAL\n**3 – 5 October 2018**\n\n_Figure 5: Example of SMF panel._\n\n\n#### 3. INVESTIGATING RESELLER PANELS\n\nThis section presents our brief analysis of reseller panels, which\ncan be considered as the middle-man in the supply chain,\nconnecting customer-facing sellers, like the social media\nmarketing company Devumi [11], to main SMF providers, like\nLinux/Moose. We start by presenting the data collection and the\ndifferent analytical steps taken to evaluate the striking\nsimilarities in reseller panels that brought us to uncover a key\nactor in the supply chain: software panel sellers. We then\ninvestigate software panels in an attempt to understand how they\ncan be linked to the whitelisted IP addresses.\n\n#### 3.1 Data collection\n\nTo evaluate these actors, we started by collecting information,\nsearching web pages containing keywords about SMF\nwholesaling, such as ‘smm bulk’, ‘smm panel’ and ‘smm\nreseller’ (‘smm’ for social media marketing). We also translated\nthe keywords in Arabic, Turkish, Spanish and Russian to\nenhance the number of panels found. We discovered a total of\n735 web pages that could be related to SMF wholesaling. We\nwent through each of them manually to determine whether the\nweb page was an actual reseller panel or something else. Out of\nthese 735 web pages, 343 were up and represented what we\nwere seeking, as shown in Figure 5.\n\n#### 3.2 Similarities in reseller panels: software panel sellers\n\nMany of the 343 web pages looked similar, raising our first\nassumption that a small number of actors could be behind SMF\n\n\nreselling. To test this hypothesis, we gathered WHOIS data,\ncertificate information, a fingerprint of the web application\n(framework, programming language, web container/server), IP\naddresses and HTML content for each of these 343 web pages\nand attempted to find similarities in the panels by clustering the\ndata through various methods.\n\nThe clustering did not yield much in the way of results, except for\none large cluster. We found that 226 web pages (66% of the\ndataset) were coded in PHP, used similar combinations of\nclient‑side JavaScript libraries (including jQuery, Moment.js,\nUnderscore.js, Twitter Bootstrap and Font Awesome) and were\nhosted on the same IP address belonging to OVH. This OVH IP\naddress was running an Ngnix server on which, according to a\nquery made with the RiskIQ PassiveTotal Community platform\n\n[12] on 17 July 2018, 977 other domains were hosted. Just\nglancing at these 977 domains revealed that most of them were\nrelated to SMF bulk reselling due to keywords in them, such as\n‘smmpanel’, ‘cheapsmmservices’ or ‘bulkfollows’. While visiting\nthem, we found that they were indeed reseller panels with similar\nlogin pages, but customized differently (branding, bootstrap\nthemes, pictures, etc.) and showing some variances in prices.\n\nFurther investigation of the domains led us to one that\nadvertised the sale of a software panel. The service offered an\n‘All-in-one solution for reselling or providing SMM services’,\nincluding web hosting and panel maintenance. To use the\nservice, one would only need to own a domain and pay a\nmonthly price based on the number of orders made, ranging\nfrom 50 USD up to 200 USD per month.\n\nMoreover, the panel demo available on the website was similar\nto most of the domains we visited that were hosted on the OVH\n\n\n-----\n\n**MONTREAL** **WWW.VIRUSBULLETIN.COM/CONFERENCE**\n**3 – 5 October 2018**\n\n_Figure 6: Comment from the thread ‘Who Is The Main SMM Panel Services Provider?’ on Black Hat World [17]._\n\n\nIP address. This OVH IP address could represent the activity of\na software panel seller and the multiple clients who have bought\nthe service. To confirm this, we correlated the reCAPTCHA\nSiteKey found in the signup page of the software panel seller\nwith the ones found in the signup pages of the active domains\nhosted on the OVH IP address. On 17 July 2018, 486 websites\nwere up and were accepting signups (out of the 977 domains\nhosted on the OVH IP address), and from them, 99% used the\nsame reCAPTCHA SiteKey as the one found in the web page of\nthe software panel seller. This allowed us to confirm that the\ncluster found in the data represented a software panel seller and\nits related clients.\n\nWhile investigating the 117 web pages from our first dataset\nthat were not hosted on the OVH IP address, we discovered that\nthe cluster found above was not an outlier: there are several\nsoftware panel sellers available online and they have many\nclients who all have similar panels. In total, through a similar\nanalysis, we found approximately 1,500 reseller panels and five\nsoftware panel sellers, three of them offering hosting. For\nresearch reproducibility, we published the list of reseller panels\nand software panel sellers online [13].\n\nFinally, our earlier assumption that only a few actors are behind\nreseller panels was proven false: there are rather a lot of\nresellers in the industry, all of them enabled through software\npanel sellers. The latter are, without question, key actors in the\nindustry, providing panels to those who want to get involved in\nbulk SMF reselling, but who do not have the technological skills\nrequired to build efficient panels.\n\n#### 3.3 From SMF reseller panels to main providers\n\nWe tried to find the direct link between SMF reseller panels and\nmain providers, like Linux/Moose. We looked at features\noffered by three panel software sellers and purchased the service\nfrom one of them. We also visited threads on the Black Hat\n_World forum related to SMF reselling, to see if we could find_\nany clues as to how resellers find their main providers and how\nthey connect their panels for automated order processing.\n\nWe discovered that all software panels provide API access for\ncustomers to automatically send orders to them and offer the\npossibility to complete the received orders manually or use an\nAPI to automate the process. The ‘automated order processing’\n\n\nAPI is, however, not linked to a provider. Reseller panel owners\nneed to find their own provider(s). Two software panel sellers\nmentioned the following feature: ‘Automatically Place Orders\nTo Other SMM Reseller Panels’. Resellers can thus connect\ntheir panel to other reseller panels and act as an added\nmiddle‑man in the SMF supply process. Discussions on the\ninfamous Black Hat World forum did show that, indeed, many\nresellers are looking for one or multiple main SMF provider(s)\n\n[14–17], but just end up connecting to other, cheaper panels, as\nsuggested in the comment [17] shown in Figure 6.\n\nUnfortunately, apart from the possibility of using another\nreseller panel’s API to fulfil orders, we did not discover how\nreseller panels fulfilled orders automatically through a main\nSMF provider. We could not establish the direct link between\nreseller panels and botnets like Linux/Moose. We know they\nare related, since some SMF reseller panels were found in\nthe Instagram accounts followed by Linux/Moose’s traffic.\nHowever, the whitelisted IP addresses only had RDP open and\nthus cannot receive automated API requests from reseller\npanels. We see two possibilities for them to connect: either\nthe whitelisted IP addresses’ aforementioned fat-client\nfetches the orders by itself or an RDP tunnel is created between\nthe client (such as the OVH IP address) and the whitelisted IP\naddress servers. However, further investigation is needed.\n\n#### 4. THE INDUSTRY OF SOCIAL MEDIA FRAUD\n\nDrawing from our findings, we present the potential SMF\nsupply chain, discuss the link between the actors and examine\nthe key ones that could disrupt the industry. We finally provide\nsome insights on the division of revenue in the chain, which\nseems to be quite unequal.\n\n#### 4.1 The supplying process\n\nUnderstanding the purpose of Linux/Moose’s whitelist, as well\nas evaluating reseller panels, gave us an interesting overview of\nthe potential SMF supply process, a representation of which is\nshown in Figure 7.\n\nFigure 7 represents the supply chain from an SMF provider, like\nthe botnet Linux/Moose where the service is produced, up to\nwhere the service is sold directly to customers. There are, of\ncourse, other potential supply chains. For example, reseller\n\n\n-----\n\n#### WWW.VIRUSBULLETIN.COM/CONFERENCE MONTREAL\n**3 – 5 October 2018**\n\n_Figure 7: Potential supply chain for the SMF industry._\n\n\npanels or customer-facing sellers may make their own bot\nscripts, complete their orders manually, or send their orders to\nclick-farms (large groups of low-paid labourers that conduct\nSMF manually [18]). Yet, this representation of the supply chain\nis the most probable one that emanates from this research.\n\nCustomer-facing sellers are easily accessible through online\nsearches, as discussed in previous studies of Linux/Moose\n\n[3, 4]. They sell SMF services to customers and most likely\nbuy in bulk afterwards from reseller panels. Devumi, a\ncustomer-facing company currently under criminal\ninvestigation [2], was also assumed to buy in bulk: ‘[...]\nDevumi does not appear to make its own bots. Instead, the\ncompany buys them wholesale – from a thriving global\nmarket of fake social media accounts.’ [2]\n\nAccording to this investigation, reseller panels can be linked\neither to a cheaper panel or to a main provider (through a\nprocess not yet uncovered in the case of Linux/Moose). The\npanel can also be bought from software panel sellers who enable\nhundreds, if not thousands, of non-technical resellers to get\ninvolved in SMF wholesaling. This undoubtedly increases the\nlevel of competition among reseller panel owners.\n\nYet, even though there are more resellers, access to main\nproviders seems to be protected, as software panel sellers do not\nprovide a direct link to them and many resellers on the Black\n_Hat World forum ask how main SMF providers can be found._\nThere is no doubt that main SMF providers, like Linux/Moose,\navoid any public visibility due to the criminal aspect of their\nactivity. They seem to hide behind multiple actors, staying at the\nend of the supply chain and dealing only with trusted partners.\n\n#### 4.2 Disrupting the SMF industry\n\nOne could decide to disrupt the SMF industry by taking down\nthe main providers in the supply chain – botnets – as they are\nthe ones involved in criminal activities. Yet, such action is a\nlengthy task that requires technical skills and international\ncooperation among law enforcement agencies [19]. Other actors\nin the supply chain are key and may be easier to stop: software\npanel resellers and reseller panels. These actors enable the link\nbetween customer-facing vendors and main SMF providers.\n\n\nMoreover, by putting an end to the activities of software panel\nsellers, a large portion of the currently available panels would\ndisappear. This could make the current pyramid scheme\ncrumble and negatively impact many other resellers. Such\naction would, however, require a thorough criminal\ninvestigation of the potential illicit activities behind the panels\nhosted by software panel sellers, since many options (some of\nthem more licit than others) are available for their associated\nreseller panels to fulfil orders. Nonetheless, software panel\nsellers are fundamental to the SMF supply chain: they are the\nbridge between the non‑technical actors (many reseller panels\nand customer-facing sellers) in the industry and the real\ncybercriminals behind botnets. Plus, they are not difficult to\nfind as they hide in plain sight.\n\nAn easier option would be for the OSNs themselves to go after\npanel hosters on breach of their ‘Terms of Use’ instead of going\nthrough the criminal route. The timing might be perfect given\nthe political incentives to get rid of online manipulation on\nOSNs. However, taking panel hosters down might just get\neveryone into a whack-a-mole scenario where these actors\nwould start hosting their activities on bulletproof hosting\nproviders or compromised servers, reminiscent of what\nhappened with botnet C&C servers.\n\n#### 4.3 Unequal revenue division in the supply chain\n\nLastly, let’s briefly discuss the unequal revenue division found\nin this supply chain. Indeed, based on a previous study that\ngathered information on SMF prices of customer-facing sellers\n\n[4], the medium price for 1,000 followers on Instagram is\nestimated at 13 USD[5]. On reseller panels, we gathered SMF\nprices for 58 panels, keeping the lowest and the highest prices\nfor 1,000 Instagram followers on each panel[6]. The prices found\nvaried between 0.17 USD (cheap followers) and 15 USD\n(assumed to be non-drop followers with a specific gender or\nnationality) for 1,000 Instagram followers, with a mean price of\n2.74 USD (std=3.30) and a median price of 1 USD. Considering\n\n5 We take the medium price because the average has a high standard of\ndeviation.\n6 The dataset is available online at [13].\n\n\n-----\n\n**MONTREAL** **WWW.VIRUSBULLETIN.COM/CONFERENCE**\n**3 – 5 October 2018**\n\n\nthe medium prices of Instagram followers for customer-facing\nsellers and reseller panels, if no other costs are incurred, the\nformer would make a profit of 12 USD for selling 1,000\nfollowers, leading to a net profit margin of 92%. This means\nthat for each dollar invested, customer-facing sellers would\nreceive a net income of 92 cents, a return on investment that is\nlofty.\n\nOn the other hand, such a high profit margin for customer‑facing\nsellers also indicates that reseller panel owners and main SMF\nproviders share a very small portion of what the customer paid\nfor the service. Their profit most likely comes from selling in\nbulk, as is the case for most producers at the beginning of a\nsupply chain. Yet, for reseller panels, the competition may be\nquite fierce with many reseller panels available thanks to\nsoftware panel sellers.\n\nAlso, this indicates that main SMF providers earn a very small\namount of money for each follower created and sold, as many\nactors in the supply chain take a large part of the revenue pie. If\nthis business was legal, SMF providers could integrate vertically\nand own the whole supply chain, allowing them to absorb the\nprofit margin from other actors. Yet, the illicit aspect of their\nactivity forces them to stay in the shadow and earn less per\nfollower produced.\n\nLastly, software panel sellers offering hosting seem to have an\nalluring business. For every panel they host, they earn a fee\nper month, ensuring recurring business from their customers.\nThe fee, at the time of writing, was around 25 USD to 200\nUSD per month, depending on the number of orders completed\non the panel. With these fees, few subscriptions are needed to\nstart making an interesting amount of money. For example,\nhosting 100 panels at a minimum of 25 USD would give a\nrevenue of 2,500 USD per month. Considering that the OVH\nIP address hosted 977 domains (not all of them active,\nhowever), this software panel seller may make an interesting\nmonthly revenue.\n\n#### 5. CONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, we have uncovered the potential SMF supply\nchain and discussed the operations of multiple actors involved.\nFurther research is, however, required to better understand the\ndynamics that link each actor in the supply chain. For example,\nhow many reseller panels link their panels to others and how\nmany have direct access to main SMF providers? Are some\nreseller panels more successful than others, and if so, why?\nAlso, we still have not found how reseller panels are linked to\nLinux/Moose’s whitelisted IP addresses.\n\nStill, this research is part of a two-year-long investigation that\nattempts to place a botnet’s operations in its economic context,\nunderstanding the ecosystem in which it evolves. This specific\nstudy is a first review of the wholesale industry of SMF and\nprovides key insights for actors willing to curb these fraudulent\nactivities.\n\n#### ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank Philippe Arteau and Benjamin Mbemba\nfor taking the time to review this paper.\n\n\n#### REFERENCES\n\n[1] Harris, R.; Confessore, N.; Dance, G.J.X.; Hansen, M.\n2017.
