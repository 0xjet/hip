    "plain_text": "#### REPORT\n## Operation Phantom Circuit\n\n# North Korea’s Global Data Exfiltration Campaign\n\n\n-----\n\n### Background\n\n**During STRIKE’s investigation of Operation 99, our team identified multiple command-and-control (C2)**\n\n**servers active since September 2024. These servers, despite variations in payload structure and obfuscation**\n**techniques, shared a consistent implementation across the campaign. While their primary purpose appeared to**\n**be delivering payloads and maintaining communication with infected systems over port 1224, deeper analysis**\n**revealed an additional operational layer.**\n\n**Critical questions—such as how exfiltrated data was handled and what infrastructure was used to manage**\n**these servers—remained unanswered until now. Our findings uncovered a concealed administrative system**\n**within the C2 infrastructure that provided Lazarus with centralized control over their campaign.**\n\n**The discovery of this hidden layer provided key insights into the mechanics of Lazarus’s campaign. Each C2**\n**server hosted a web-based administrative platform, built with a React application and a Node.js API. This**\n**platform was not just an interface but a comprehensive system that allowed the attackers to:**\n\n**•** **Organize and manage exfiltrated data with precision.**\n\n**•** **Maintain direct oversight of compromised systems.**\n\n**•** **Control payload delivery and other operations from a centralized hub.**\n\n**This administrative layer was consistent across all the C2 servers analyzed, even as the attackers varied their**\n**payloads and obfuscation techniques to evade detection.**\n\n##### Supply Chain Attack\n\n**Lazarus has been observed altering legitimate software packages by embedding obfuscated backdoors,**\n**deceiving developers into executing these compromised packages. To the untrained eye it goes unnoticed by**\n**the victim and successfully executes. These packages may involve anything from cryptocurrency applications**\n**to authentication solutions.**\n\n##### Global Reach\n\n**This analysis makes it evident that Lazarus was orchestrating a global operation targeting the cryptocurrency**\n**industry and developers worldwide. The campaigns resulted in hundreds of victims downloading and executing**\n**the payloads, while, in the background, the exfiltrated data was being siphoned back to Pyongyang.**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Attributing back to Pyongyang\n\n**Using NetFlow analysis and temporal traffic patterns, STRIKE traced the operation to Pyongyang with high**\n**confidence. The Lazarus Group employed a multi-layered obfuscation strategy to conceal their origin and**\n**manage their campaign. The flow of operations was as follows:**\n\n**1.** **Initial Connection: Six distinct North Korean IP addresses were observed initiating connections that**\n\n**marked the starting point of the operation.**\n\n**2.** **VPN Obfuscation: The attackers routed traffic through Astrill VPN endpoints, leveraging the**\n\n**commercial service to mask their true geographic origin.**\n\n**3.** **Proxy Relay: From the VPNs, traffic moved through an intermediate proxy layer registered to Sky**\n\n**Freight Limited in Hasan, Russia. This additional layer blended malicious traffic with legitimate network**\n**activity.**\n\n**4.** **Command-and-Control Servers: The obfuscated traffic ultimately reached the C2 infrastructure,**\n\n**hosted on Stark Industries servers. These servers facilitated payload delivery, victim management, and**\n**data exfiltration.**\n\n**This layered infrastructure tied the six North Korean IP addresses directly to the C2 servers, confirming Lazarus**\n**Group’s role in managing the operation from within North Korea.**\n\n### Key Findings\n\n**•** **The STRIKE team successfully identified the operational infrastructure used to coordinate targeted**\n**operations. We assess with high confidence that this network served to route traffic from Astrill VPNs to the**\n**destination C2s through proxies.**\n\n**•** **Lazarus uses a sophisticated network of Astrill VPN exit points and proxies to obscure traffic while**\n**managing C2 servers. STRIKE successfully traced the connections through the VPNs to six distinct IP**\n**addresses in Pyongyang, North Korea.**\n\n**•** **This operation is a clear indication of a software supply chain attack, where Lazarus is implanting malicious**\n**code into legitimate software. STRIKE observed targeted operations from September 2024 to Jan 2025.**\n\n**The latest campaign claimed 233 victims across the world.**\n\n**•** **Lazarus developed a sophisticated react application and API to manage exfiltrated data and the delivery of**\n**payloads. This application was deployed on every C2 server and managed over port 1245.**\n\n### Attacker Operational Infrastructure\n\n**Lazarus operators maintained an operational infrastructure to manage these C2s and associated assets.**\n**We began our investigation by looking into connections to the C2 server in hopes to identify from where the**\n**adversary was controlling the infrastructure. We identified an intermediate network of proxies that were found**\n**connecting to the C2s over management ports such as 1245 and 3389 (Remote Desktop).**\n\n\n-----\n\n**This intermediate proxy network according to WHOIS and other public records indicate that this IP is registered**\n**to Sky Freight Limited, located in Hasan, Russia. These are actually assigned to the Oculus Proxy network as**\n**we describe later.**\n\n**We observed the adversary managing multiple C2 servers from the IP address 83[.]234[.]227[.]50. This IP**\n\n**connected to the latest C2 server, 94[.]131[.]9[.]32, between January 17 and January 18 via port 1245 and**\n**remains active at the time of writing. Additionally, it has historically connected to 185[.]153[.]182[.]241 on ports**\n\n**1224, 1245, 2248, 2252 (C2-specific ports), and 3389 (RDP) between December 26 and January 16. It also**\n**established connections with 5[.]253[.]43[.]122 during the period of December 26 to January 17 over ports**\n**1224, 1245, and 3389. Both servers were used in targeted campaigns linked to this operation.**\n\n**The adversary accessed 185[.]153[.]182[.]241 via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on several occasions,**\n**specifically on December 30, January 6, and January 10, maintaining an RDP session for 10 days. In the**\n**context of Operation99, which involved the C2 server 5[.]253[.]43[.]122, the adversary logged in via RDP more**\n**than a dozen times between December 26 and January 15.**\n\n**Based on this activity, we assess with high confidence that IP address 83[.]234[.]227[.]50 serves as an**\n**intermediate proxy controlled by the Lazarus group, given its connection to multiple distinct C2 servers.**\n\n**Further analysis identified another IP, 83[.]234[.]227[.]49, from the same net-range connecting to a different**\n**Lazarus-controlled server (45[.]128[.]52[.]14) over ports 3389, 1224, and 1245 between December 2**\n**and December 10. This C2 was hosted on Stark Industries infrastructure and exhibited activity similar to**\n**Operation99, which was linked to attacks publicly reported in November 2024 involving Lazarus’ presence on**\n**the Codementor platform.**\n\n**Going deeper, we uncovered another Lazarus C2 server, 86[.]104[.]74[.]51,**\n**which was active throughout most of November 2024. This server, also**\n**hosted on Stark Industries infrastructure, resolved to the domain sageskills-**\n**uk[.]com in late September 2024, spoofing the legitimate entity skillsage.**\n**uk. The C2 server was accessed by the same intermediate proxy exit points**\n**hosted in Russia.**\n\n**The IP address 83[.]234[.]227[.]53 was observed connecting to the**\n**Sageskills website (a known Lazarus C2) on ports 1224,1245, and 3389 on**\n**November 8, 2024, and November 29, 2024. Additionally, the IP address**\n**83[.]234[.]227[.]49 was also seen connecting to the same server over the**\n**same ports between November 7, 2024, and November 11, 2024.**\n**Archived Landing Page for Adversary**\n**controlled coding learning site**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Intermediate Proxies\n\n**The source IPs observed connecting to the various C2s form a network of intermediate proxies designed to**\n**mask traffic. This layer leverages ISP proxies to obscure the true origin of the connections.**\n\n**The IP address 83[.]234[.]227[.]50, observed connecting to the command-and-control server, appears to**\n**be linked to an Oculus Proxy endpoint. Similarly, 83[.]234[.]227[.]49 is also associated with Oculus Proxy**\n**infrastructure. The adversary is using 83.234.227.49 through 83.234.227.53 for this infrastructure exclusively.**\n\n**These findings suggest that the adversary is deliberately leveraging specific proxy endpoints within the Oculus**\n**Proxy network to further obscure their traffic. This tactic adds an additional layer of anonymity, complicating**\n**attribution and detection efforts, and demonstrates the adversary's strategic use of commercial proxy services**\n**to evade monitoring and ensure operational security.**\n\n### Astrill VPN connections\n\n**STRIKE assesses with high confidence that the IPs used to connect to the C2s were merely a relay/proxy and**\n**used to obfuscate the true origin. The adversary was establishing a secondary session after connecting to the**\n**VPN with the proxy, thus obscuring the true origin of where they actually connected from.**\n\n**During the Sageskills attack in November 2024, we observed a connection from an Astrill VPN IP address**\n**(70.39.70.196) to 83[.]234[.]227[.]53 between November 1 and November 6, 2024. According to Virus Total**\n**the Astrill IP address is linked to the DPRK IT Worker scheme, which at first seemed low confidence, but after**\n**analysis we can assess with high confidence that it is an exit point used by Lazarus.**\n\n**In December, the same Astrill IP was also observed connecting to 83[.]234[.]227[.]50, which had been seen**\n**communicating to the C2 servers. The latest campaign that we discovered another Astrill VPN IP address**\n**was seen connecting to the proxy 83[.]234[.]227[.]53 on 1/23/2025 which in turn connected to the C2**\n**94[.]131[.]9[.]32 on that same day. North Korea has used Astrill VPNs in the past, which have been identified in**\n**targeted IT worker schemes.**\n\n##### Tracing Connections Back to North Korea\n\n**North Korea appears to be using Astrill VPNs**\n**significantly from the North Korean net-range**\n**175.45.176.0/22 which represents their only**\n**assigned address space. The following is the**\n**analysis of specific IPs involved in routing**\n**traffic through proxies in Russia to manage C2**\n**infrastructure.**\n\n\n**In December 2024, a North Korean IP address**\n**(175.45.178.130) was observed connecting to**\n**the Astrill VPN (70.39.70.196), aligning with**\n**the timeframe of the campaign's attacks and**\n\n\n**Operational Infrastructure**\n\n\n-----\n\n**connections to the C2 servers. Notably, on December 2, 2024, the Astrill VPN established a connection to the**\n**proxy server at 83[.]234[.]227[.]49 immediately after the North Korean IP connected to the VPN. On the same**\n**day, the VPN then connected to the C2 server (5[.]253[.]43[.]122), establishing a clear chain of activity that ties**\n**the North Korean IP, VPN, proxy, and C2 server together, identifying the North Korean IP as the true source of**\n**the traffic.**\n\n**These findings underscore the coordination of the campaign's infrastructure and provide direct evidence**\n**of the North Korean IP's involvement in initiating the activity. The temporal alignment of connections—from**\n**the North Korean IP to the VPN, through the proxy, and finally to the C2 server—highlights the deliberate**\n**use of obfuscation layers to conceal the origin of the traffic while maintaining operational efficiency. This**\n**connectivity pattern strengthens attribution to North Korean state actors and demonstrates the sophistication**\n**of their tactics.**\n\n**Approximate Source Origin in North Korea**\n\n### Operational Infrastructure Temporal Analysis\n\n**The observed cyber campaign, attributed to North Korean actors, reveals the use of proxies as key facilitators**\n**for managing Command and Control (C2) servers from November 2024 to January 2025. Attackers employed**\n**proxies such as 83.234.227.49, 83.234.227.53, and 83.234.227.51 to route and manage connections to**\n\n**multiple C2 servers, ensuring obfuscation of attacker-originated traffic. These proxies served as intermediaries,**\n**shielding the attackers’ infrastructure and providing an additional layer of anonymity. The campaign involved**\n**direct ties to North Korean IPs, including 175.45.178.130, 175.45.178.14, and 175.45.178.10, suggesting that**\n**either the operations were routed through North Korean assets (unlikely as its a closed country and closed**\n**network) or coordinated directly from within the country. The simultaneous use of multiple proxies for managing**\n**distinct C2 servers reflects an advanced understanding of operational security and network management.**\n\n**The activity peaked in December 2024, with a heightened level of proxy usage to facilitate communication with**\n**C2 infrastructure, including servers at 185.153.182.241, 86.104.74.51, and 5.253.43.122. The usage of Astrill**\n**VPN IPs, such as 70.39.70.196 and 45.58.143.196, further complicated attribution and detection by masking**\n**the origin of the connections.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The attackers’ strategy of overlapping timelines, managing C2s through geographically distributed proxies,**\n**and leveraging secure VPN channels showcases a sophisticated campaign aimed at ensuring resilience and**\n**minimizing detection. The deliberate routing of communications through managed proxies highlights the**\n**attackers’ focus on maintaining control over their infrastructure while evading defensive measures.**\n\n### Dropbox Data Exfiltration\n\n**Throughout the December campaign, we observed the C2 server at 185.153.182.241 repeatedly connecting**\n**to multiple Dropbox IPs. We assess with high confidence that this activity likely indicates the adversary**\n**transferring stolen data to a Dropbox location. These connections occurred with the C2 acting as the client**\n**between December 4, 2024, and December 30, 2024 with a total connection time of 5hrs and 14 mins. A similar**\n**pattern was observed with the C2 server 5.253.43.122, which established connections between December**\n**16, 2024, and December 26, 2024. This behavior also appeared during the November campaign, involving the**\n\n**C2 server at 86.104.74.51, which connected to Dropbox IPs from November 8, 2024, to November 30, 2024.**\n**Additionally, the same pattern re-emerged during the January campaign, with connections to Dropbox IPs**\n**occurring between January 17, 2025, and January 24, 2025.**\n\n### November Campaign\n\n**The campaign in November had 181 unique victims**\n**with the C2 (86.104.74.51) spread around the**\n**world. Based on the above analysis and the role of**\n**intermediate proxies, the adversary was managing**\n**the server through the proxies 83.234.227.53 and**\n**83.234.227.49 via port 1245 and 3389.**\n\n**Victims from November 2024 campaign (connections made to c2)**\n\n### December Campaign\n\n**Campaigns in December 2024, indicated**\n**1,225 unique victims across three C2 servers**\n**(185.153.182.241, 45.128.52.14 and 86.104.74.51).**\n**With a concentration in Brazil (32 unique IPs) and**\n**India (284 unique IPs) being the countries with the**\n**most traffic to the C2.**\n\n**Victims from December 2024 campaign (connections made to c2)**\n\n\n-----\n\n### January Campaign Analysis\n\n**The recently established C2 server (94.131.9.32) is**\n**receiving traffic originating from 175.45.178.11 and**\n**175.45.178.10, routed through multiple layers of**\n**obfuscation. Notably, traffic from 175.45.178.11 was**\n**consistently routed throughout January 2025, flowing**\n**through the Astrill VPN exit points (70.39.70.196,**\n**70.39.70.197) and the proxy (83.234.227.53)**\n**before reaching its destination. Activity involving**\n**94.131.9.32 peaked between January 21–23, 2025,**\n**as significant traffic flowed to the server via these**\n**proxies. There are 233 unique victims as part of this**\n\n**recent campaign communicating over port 1224.**\n**India was the most impacted country with 110 unique**\n**victims during the course of this campaign.**\n\n**The adversary set up an additional server**\n**(94.232.247.192), also hosted at Stark Industries,**\n**which the proxy 83.234.227.53 connected to on**\n**1/23/2025. As of this writing, this server is no longer**\n**online. Another proxy, 83.234.227.52, established**\n**connections on ports 1224 and 3389 between**\n**1/21/2025 and 1/22/2025. This campaign was short-**\n**lived with 87 total unique victims communicating to**\n**this server with India being the hardest hit.**\n\n### C2 Operational Infrastructure\n\n\n**Victims from January 2025 campaign (connections made to c2)**\n\n**Victims from January 2025 campaign (connections made to c2)**\n\n\n**Much of the analysis has focused on the attackers' operational**\n**infrastructure and attribution to Pyongyang. However, one**\n**aspect that remains unexplored is the role of port 1245 in these**\n**campaigns. It is evident that the proxy servers connect over port**\n**1245, suggesting they may be managing certain operations. Our**\n**investigation uncovered that, beyond payloads and downloaders,**\n**the C2 servers also hosted a ‘hidden’ web-admin panel. Upon**\n**examination, this web-admin portal was found to operate on port**\n**1245 and displayed a login page requiring authentication to access**\n**the backend. This panel, hosted on the C2 servers, appears to**\n**facilitate the display of exfiltrated data from victims and provides**\n**attackers with the ability to search and filter the information.**\n\n\n**React Web-Admin logi**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The panel seems to be custom-built and specifically deployed on the C2 servers. Analysis of traffic patterns**\n**suggests that the adversary accesses the information using Astrill VPNs and through proxy connections.**\n\n**Further investigation of the server revealed valuable insights into its functionality and the operator's interface.**\n**Our findings showed that the application is built on Node.js and exposes multiple API endpoints, potentially**\n**offering additional critical information. Analyzing the Config.js file provided details about the available API**\n**endpoints and the specific pages accessible to the operator.**\n\n**Config.js**\n\n**Another file App.js revealed more detailed information about specific pages that would be accessible to the**\n**operator. An extraction from this file shows specific page paths that are hidden behind a login wall.**\n\n**App.js**\n\n##### Info\n\n**The info page offers details about victims, although the actual backend data could not be displayed. By**\n**examining the files, we can determine its true functionality. A static analysis of the JavaScript files reveals that**\n**the server retrieves victim-uploaded data from the backend. This includes exfiltrated information such as PC**\n**names, URLs, passwords, and more. Furthermore, it displays data extracted from implants interacting with the**\n**/keys API endpoint.**\n\n**Info.js**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The data sent from the payload will be displayed in the backend within the keys table.**\n\n### Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)\n\n**The Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) is a systematic methodology designed to evaluate multiple**\n**possible explanations for a given issue or situation. Originally developed by the CIA, ACH aids analysts in**\n\n**organizing evidence, identifying biases, and methodically comparing competing hypotheses to determine the**\n**most likely conclusion.**\n\n##### Hypotheses\n\n**•** **H1: The campaign is led by the Lazarus Group (North Korean APT) and directly involves North Korea.**\n\n**•** **H2: The campaign is executed by a non-state actor or criminal group attempting to impersonate Lazarus to**\n**obscure attribution.**\n\n**•** **H3: The operation involves collaboration among multiple state or non-state actors, with Lazarus playing a**\n**partial or indirect role.**\n\n**•** **H4: The campaign is entirely unrelated to Lazarus and is being misattributed due to similar TTPs (Tactics,**\n**Techniques, and Procedures).**\n\n##### Analysis\n\n**•** **H1 (Lazarus Group involvement): Most of the evidence strongly supports this hypothesis, including**\n**direct links to North Korean IPs, Lazarus’s known TTPs, infrastructure usage, and targeting patterns.**\n**STRIKE's investigation aligns closely with this attribution.**\n\n**•** **H2 (Non-state actor impersonation): While possible, the campaign’s sophistication, scale, and**\n**alignment with Lazarus's historical operations make this scenario less credible. Evidence such as ties to**\n**Pyongyang IPs and Astrill VPN activity further undermines this hypothesis.**\n\n**•** **H3 (Collaborative effort): Although this hypothesis accounts for the operation's complexity, there is no**\n**compelling evidence to suggest collaboration beyond Lazarus. The observed infrastructure and techniques**\n**indicate a centralized effort consistent with the group’s capabilities.**\n\n**•** **H4 (Misattribution): The majority of the evidence directly implicates Lazarus, making misattribution highly**\n**unlikely. While some techniques (e.g., supply chain attacks) could theoretically be replicated, the clear link**\n**to Pyongyang IPs and Astrill VPN usage strongly counters this hypothesis.**\n\n##### Conclusions\n\n**•** **Most Likely Hypothesis: H1 - The campaign is orchestrated by the Lazarus Group (North Korean APT).**\n\n**•** **Confidence Level: High.**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Operation Phantom Circuit has exposed a highly sophisticated global campaign by Lazarus, targeting the**\n**cryptocurrency industry and software developers through supply chain attacks. By embedding obfuscated**\n**backdoors into legitimate software packages, Lazarus deceived users into executing compromised**\n**applications, enabling them to exfiltrate sensitive data and manage victims through Command and Control**\n**(C2) servers over port 1224. The campaign’s infrastructure leveraged hidden React-based web-admin panels**\n**and Node.js APIs for centralized management of stolen data, affecting over 233 victims worldwide. This**\n**exfiltrated data was traced back to Pyongyang, North Korea, through a layered network of Astrill VPNs and**\n**intermediate proxies.**\n\n**This operation underscores an urgent call to action for organizations and developers to strengthen their supply**\n**chain security by implementing rigorous code verification processes and network traffic monitoring. Security**\n**teams must collaborate globally to share threat intelligence and stay ahead of Lazarus’s evolving tactics, which**\n**leverage modern web technologies and advanced obfuscation techniques. Industries, particularly those at high**\n**risk like cryptocurrency, must prioritize adopting robust monitoring tools, enforcing patch management, and**\n**deploying proactive defenses to mitigate future attacks from advanced threat actors. The time to act is now—**\n**failing to address these vulnerabilities leaves critical systems and data exposed to similar campaigns.**\n\n### Contact STRIKE for Incident Response\n\n**If you suspect your organization has been impacted by Operation Phantom Circuit, Operation 99, or**\n**similar Lazarus activities, contact the STRIKE Strategic Intelligence team immediately at investigations@**\n**securityscorecard.io.
