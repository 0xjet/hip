The payload](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/vn/threat-encyclopedia/malware/JS_KOPILUWAK.B)\nis capable of exfiltrating data, as well as downloading and triggering additional malware and\nexecuting arbitrary commands on the infected machine. Security researchers have since\nnotified CERT-Bund, Germany’s federal computer emergency response team.\n\n**[[READ: What is spear-phishing, and how can you defend against it?]](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/vn/security/news/cyber-attacks/spear-phishing-101-what-is-spear-phishing)**\n\n[Turla’s latest campaign is noted for possibly using watering hole and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/vn/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/137/watering-hole-101) [spear-phishing emails](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/vn/security/news/cyber-attacks/spear-phishing-101-what-is-spear-phishing)\nthat lure would-be victims with an email containing an invitation for a G20 Task Force summit\non digital economy. The event is real, slated in October, and security experts note that the\nPDF, named Save the Date G20 Digital Economy Taskforce 23 24 October.pdf, attached in\nthe spear-phishing emails appear to be a legitimate file but ultimately a decoy. It also drops a\nmalicious JavaScript file that executes KopiLuwak in the infected system’s memory when\ndecrypted.\n\n**[RELATED:** **APT10/menuPass cyberespionage campaign Operation Cloud Hopper**\n**attacks managed service providers]**\n\nTurla, a Russian-speaking cyberespionage group, is known for using unique, stealthy tactics.\n[They made headlines in early June when their command and control (C&C) servers were](https://www.scmagazineuk.com/russian-hackers-used-britney-spears-instagram-posts-to-control-malware/article/667180/)\nfound hiding in the comment section of Britney Spears’ Instagram posts.

IT/system administrators and information\n[security professionals should adopt best practices against targeted attacks. Keeping the OS](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/vn/security/news/cyber-attacks/understanding-targeted-attacks-defensive-measures)\nand its programs updated should be intuitive—it helps prevent attackers from leveraging\n[security flaws as doorways into the systems. Consider virtual patching in the absence of](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/vn/security/news/virtualization-and-cloud/virtual-patching-in-mixed-environments-how-it-protects-you/)\npatches for certain vulnerabilities. Enforce the principle of least privilege.
