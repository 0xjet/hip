It’s hard to understand the\neconomic reverberations of a disruptive attack on critical infrastructure, whether for financial\ngain or otherwise. With the pipeline being proactively shut down as of Sunday, May 9th,\nthere are concerns around how this outage will affect ongoing fuel prices and for how long.\nHow the coming weeks and months play out may serve as a template for predicting impact\nand risk associated with similar attacks that will inevitably follow.\n\n**SentinelOne detects and protects against DarkSide ransomware. No action is required**\n**for our customers.**\n\nSentinelOne Protects from DarkSide Ransomware\n[Watch Demo](https://assets.sentinelone.com/ransom/darkside-vid)\nIn this post, we discuss the evolution of the DarkSide malware and affiliate networks,\nincluding the evolution of their feature sets and recruitment areas.\n\nWatch How SentinelOne Mitigates DarkSide Ransomware\nBeyond Protection, it's important that your security tool can mitigate and rollback in the case\nof a Ransomware attack\n\n\n-----\n\n[Watch Rollback](https://assets.sentinelone.com/ransom/darkside-mitigation)\n\n## Who is DarkSide?\n\nThe attack on Colonial Pipeline has been attributed to DarkSide, a relatively new\n[ransomware family that emerged on the crimeware market in November 2020.](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/)\n\nDarkSide claims not to attack Medical, Educational, Non-Profit, or Government sectors\nDarkSide launched as a RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service) with the stated goal of only\ntargeting ‘large corporations.’ They are primarily focused on recruiting Russian (CIS)\naffiliates, and are very skeptical of partnerships or interactions outside of that region. From\nthe onset, DarkSide was focused on choosing the ‘right’ targets and identifying their most\nvaluable data. This speaks to their efficiency and discernment when choosing where to focus\ntheir efforts. From their inception, DarkSide claimed they’d avoid attacking the medical,\neducational, non-profit, or government sectors.\n\n\n-----\n\nDarkSide affiliate recruitment post\nAt the time of launch, the features offered by DarkSide were fairly standard. They\nemphasized their speed of encryption and a wealth of options for dealing with anything that\nmay inhibit the encryption process (i.e., security software). They also advertised a Linux\nvariant with comparable features. Following in the footsteps of recently successful\nransomware families like Maze and Cl0p, DarkSide established a victim data leaks blog as\nfurther leverage to encourage ransom payouts.\n\nThe original DarkSide 1.0 Feature set was advertised as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nWindows [\n     full ASM, salsa20 + rsa 1024, \n     i / o, own implementation of salsa and rsa, \n     fast / auto (improved space) / full, \n     token impersonalization for working with balls, \n     slave table, freeing busy files, \n     changing file permissions, \n     arp scanner, \n     process termination, \n     service termination, \n     drag-and-drop and much more].\nLinux [\n     C ++, chacha20 + rsa 4096, \n     multithreading (including Hyper-threading, analog of i / o on windows),\n     support for truncated OS assemblies (esxi 5.0+), \n     fast / space, \n     directory configuration and much more].\nAdmin panel [\n     full ajax, \n     automatic acceptance of Bitcoin, Monero, \n     generation of win / lin builds with indication of all parameters (processes,\nservices, folders, extensions ...), \n     bots reporting and detailed statistics on the company’s performance, \n     automatic distribution and withdrawal of funds, \n     sub -accounts, \n     online chat and many others].\nLeak site [\n     hidden posts, \n     phased publication of target data and many more functionality].\nCDN system for data storage [\n     Receiving quotas, \n     fast data loading, \n     storage 6m from the moment of loading].\n\n## A Well-Organized Affiliate Network\n\n```\nHopeful affiliates are subject to DarkSide’s rigorous vetting process, which examines the\ncandidate’s ‘work history,’ areas of expertise, and past profits among other things. To get\nstarted, affiliates were required to deposit 20 BTC (at the time, that amounted to around\n$300,000 USD).\n\n\n-----\n\nDarkSide announces improved CDN\nOver the following months, DarkSide continued to improve its services, while also expanding\nits affiliate network. By late November 2020, DarkSide launched a more advanced Content\nDelivery Network (CDN) that allowed their operators to more efficiently store and distribute\nstolen victim data. Many of their high-value targets found themselves listed on the victim\nblog, including a number of financial, accounting, and legal firms, as well as technology\ncompanies.\n\nInitial access can take many forms depending on the affiliate involved, their needs, and\ntimeline. A majority of the campaigns observed were initiated only after the enterprise had\nbeen thoroughly scouted via Cobalt Strike beacon infections. After the initial reconnaissance\nphase, the operators would deploy the DarkSide ransomware wherever it would cause the\ngreatest disruption.\n\n## DarkSide Decryption Tool – Is it Working?\n\n[In January 2021, Bitdefender released a DarkSide decryption tool. This tool was also posted](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2021/01/darkside-ransomware-decryption-tool/)\nto the NoMoreRansom project website. The tool had a reportedly high success rate.\n\nDarkSide 2.0 performance comparisons\nBy March, the group announced the launch of the new and improved DarkSide 2.0. The new\niteration included many improvements for both their Windows and Linux variants and is no\nlonger subject to the decryption tool. DarkSide 2.0 reportedly encrypts data on disk twice as\nfast as the original.\n\nOther updated features include:\n\nExpanded multi-processor support (parallel/simultaneous encryption across volumes)\n\n\n-----\n\nEXE and DLL-based payloads\nUpdated SALSA20+RSA1024 implementation with “proprietary acceleration”\nNew operating modes (Fast / Full / Auto)\n19 total build settings\nActive account impersonation\nActive Directory support (discovery and traversal)\nNew CMD-line parameter support\n\nOn the Linux side, DarkSide 2.0 offers the following updates:\n\nUpdated multithreading support\nUpdated CHACHA20 + RSA 4096 implementation\n2 new operating modes (Fast / Space)\n14 Total build settings\nSupport for all major ESXi versions\nNAS support (Synology, OMV)\n\nAlong with this expanded feature set, SentinelLabs researchers have seen a shift in the\ndeployment of the DarkSide ransomware, from standard packers like VMProtect and UPX to\na custom packer internally referred to as ‘encryptor2.’\n\n## A Battle for Territory\n\nWith the release of DarkSide 2.0, the group has continued to increase its footprint in the\nRansomware landscape. Along with their territorial expansion throughout 2021, DarkSide\nalso increased their ‘pressure campaigns’ on victims to include DDoS attacks along with the\nthreat of data leakage. They are able to invoke L3/L7 DDoS attacks if their victims choose to\nresist ‘cooperation’.\n\nMore recently, DarkSide operators have been attempting to attract more expertise around\nassessing data and network value, along with seeking others to provide existing access or\nnewer methods of initial access. These efforts are meant to make operations more\nstreamlined and increase efficiency.\n\n\n-----\n\nNew methods and talent areas\nThe Colonial Pipeline attack is only the latest in a slew of increasingly daring ransomware\nattacks. The absolute best defense against a severe ransomware attack (and the nightmare\nthat follows) is preparation and prevention. Technology is a huge part of that, but one must\nnot discount user hygiene and education. It is vital to keep end users up to date on what\nthreats are out there and how to spot them. Vigilant users, along with robust preventative\ncontrols are key. Business continuity planning and disaster recovery drills are not fun, but\nthey are critical and necessary to ensure readiness and resilience against these threats.\n\nThe SentinelOne platform is fully capable of preventing and detecting the malware and\nartifacts associated with DarkSide ransomware. We hope that the pipeline starts flowing\nagain soon; our society depends on it to live.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nSHA256\n156335b95ba216456f1ac0894b7b9d6ad95404ac7df447940f21646ca0090673\n4d9432e8a0ceb64c34b13d550251b8d9478ca784e50105dc0d729490fb861d1a\n61ca175c2f04cb5279f8507e69385577cf04e4e896a01d0b5357746a241c7846\nbfb31c96f9e6285f5bb60433f2e45898b8a7183a2591157dc1d766be16c29893\na11cc5051e3a88428db495f6d8e4b6381a1cb3fa5946a525ef5c00bfcb44e210\n2dcac9f48c3989619e0abd200beaae901852f751c239006886ac3ec56d89e3ef\n243dff06fc80a049f4fb37292f8b8def0fce29768f345c88ee10699e22b0ae60\n12ee27f56ec8a2a3eb2fe69179be3f7a7193ce2b92963ad33356ed299f7ed975\n9cee5522a7ca2bfca7cd3d9daba23e9a30deb6205f56c12045839075f7627297\n5860f2415aa9a30c045099e3071f099313f653ae1806d6bcdb5f47d5da96c6d7\n78782fd324bc98a57274bd3fff8f756217c011484ebf6b614060115a699ee134\ndc4b8dfff72ff08ec4daa8db4c096a350a9a1bf5434ba7796ab10ec1322ac38c\n8cfd28911878af048fb96b6cc0b9da770542576d5c2b20b193c3cfc4bde4d3bc\n4edb883d1ac97824ee42d9f92917cc84b52995abcd17b2852a7e3d5bb567ffbe\ne9417cb1baec2826e3f5a6f64ade26c1374d74d8aa41bfabd29ea20ea5894b14\nfb76b4a667c6d790c39fcc93a3aac8cd2a224f0eb9ece4ecfd7825f606c2a8b6\nSHA1\n2715340f82426f840cf7e460f53a36fc3aad52aa\n86ca4973a98072c32db97c9433c16d405e4154ac\n7944ae1d281bbeeb6f317e2ececf6b4c83e63a06\na4e2deb65f97f657b50e48707b883ce2b138e787\nf90f83c3dbcbe9b5437316a67a8abe6a101ef4c3\n483c894ee5786704019873b0fc99080fdf1a0976\n7ae73b5e1622049380c9b615ce3b7f636665584b\n2fc8514367d4799d90311b1b1f277b3fca5ca731\nd1dfe82775c1d698dd7861d6dfa1352a74551d35\nd3495ac3b708caeceffab59949dbf8a9fa24ccef\n7a29a8f5e14da1ce40365849eb59487dbb389d08\n1f90eb879580faef3c37e10d0a0345465eebd4ee\n88fc623483f7ffe57f986ed10789e6723083fcd8\n996567f5e84b7666ff3182699da0de894e7ea662\n21145fd2cc8767878edbd7d1900c4c4f926a6d5b\n076d0d8d07368ef680aeb0c08f7f2e624c46cbc5\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK\n\n```\n[T1112 Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/)\n\n[T1012 Query Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012/)\n\n[T1082 System Information Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)\n\n[T1120 Peripheral Device Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1120/)\n\n[T1005 Data from Local System](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005/)\n\n[T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)\n\n[T1543.003 Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[T1490 Inhibit System Recovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490/)\n[T1553.004 Subvert Trust Controls: Install Root Certificate](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/004/)\n[T1078 Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/)\n\n\n-----",
