Some of the most significant cyberattacks over\nthe last five years have been turning points in the state of cybersecurity of international\nspace programs and organizations with satellite infrastructure in space.\n\nSpace exploration and the significance of having satellite infrastructure in space is a key\ndriver of scientific research and technological innovation. However, despite receiving billions\nof dollars in funding, the digital infrastructure and information systems supporting space\nprograms have been impacted by significant cyberattacks from nation-state threat actors and\nfinancially motivated cybercriminal groups. This blog aims to use open source intelligence\n(OSINT) research to compile and highlight significant cybersecurity incidents impacting the\nspace industry that defenders should consider when securing these types of environments.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere have been a number of positive and landmark headlines recently, such as the\n[successful launches by SpaceX, BlueOrigin, and Boeing, SpaceX providing critical](https://www.spacex.com/launches/)\n[communications infrastructure to Ukraine via Starlink, and the creation of the Space Force](https://www.spaceforce.mil/About-Us/About-Space-Force/History/)\n[and Space ISAC. Space is also rarely able to escape geopolitical tensions and, as such, the](https://spacenews.com/space-information-sharing-and-analysis-center-to-be-based-in-colorado-springs/)\n[Russian mission announced it was pulling out of the International Space Station (ISS), which](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62308069)\nhas had its share of cybersecurity issues in the past.\n\nIn 2008, prior to when the ISS switched to Linux from Windows XP, Russian cosmonauts\n[reportedly introduced an infected USB device to the computers aboard the space station.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/12/international-space-station-virus-epidemics-malware)\nThe Windows XP-based laptops used by the astronauts on the ISS were infected with a virus\ncalled W32.Gammima.AG, a malicious password-swiping computer virus. Not many\ntechnical details about the event and the impact it had on the station's computers were\nreported publicly. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) officials at the time\n[described the virus as a \"nuisance.\" Adding that it is \"not a frequent occurrence, but this isn't](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/aug/28/spacetechnology.spaceexploration)\nthe first time.\"\n\n**Digital Espionage in Space: Satellites and NASA**\n\n**Satellite Turla**\n\nSatellite communications (SATCOM) can provide both TV broadcasting and access to the\ninternet to remote locations. This type of satellite-based internet access, however, is known\n[as downstream-only connection. In September 2015, Kaspersky Labs disclosed that a](https://securelist.com/satellite-turla-apt-command-and-control-in-the-sky/72081/)\n[Russia-based advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Turla (aka Snake or](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010/)\nVenomousBear) exploited weaknesses in these downstream-only satellite internet\nconnections. Turla would monitor downstream connections, identify active IP addresses,\nselect one to appear as the originating source IP during intrusions, and hijack it by hiding\nmalicious code within packets sent to and from the satellite. Systems compromised by Turla\nwould also then exfiltrate data to IP addresses of regular satellite-based internet users. Turla\nused this special technique to target systems of governments, embassies, military entities,\neducational institutions, research organizations, and pharmaceutical firms across the Middle\nEast and Africa. Turla's operations have been tied to the Russian Federal Security Service\n(FSB) by [Estionian intelligence services. In February 2022, German investigative reporters](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/4378262/Estonian-Foreign-Intelligence-Service.pdf)\n[disclosed the identities of two Turla developers and their ties to the Russian FSB.](https://interaktiv.br.de/elite-hacker-fsb/en/index.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 1: Satellite Turla hijacking attack explanation (Source: Kaspersky)](https://securelist.com/satellite-turla-apt-command-and-control-in-the-sky/72081/)\n**NASA & Chinese Technology Theft**\n\n[In December 2018, the US Department of Justice charged two Chinese nationals part of](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1121706/download)\n[APT10 (aka menuPass, StonePanda or POTASSIUM) that conducted a 12-year, Chinese](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0045/)\nMinistry of State Security (MSS) global hacking spree that stole data from dozens of US\ncompanies and government agencies in a sophisticated technology theft campaign. Two of\nthe victims who had hundreds of gigabytes of sensitive data and information stolen included\nthe NASA Goddard Space Center and the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The APT10\n[operators were able to use spear-phishing attachments) to deploy the PoisonIvy malware](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0012/)\nonto the victim's computers. The emails used malicious document attachments and sender\naddresses of legitimate but compromised accounts. Once installed, PoisonIvy records user\nkeystrokes to steal credentials and could collect relevant files and other information from\ninfected systems. Collected files were then added to encrypted archives and exfiltrated to\nremote servers owned by APT10.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: APT10 members on Cyber Most Wanted list (Source: [FBI)](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/apt-10-group)\n**NASA & The SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack**\n\nNASA was also more recently a victim of sophisticated Russian cyber-espionage campaigns.\n[In December 2020, the SolarWinds supply chain attack linked to the Nobelium APT group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016/)\n(aka APT29, CozyBear, or DarkHalo) was disclosed. It involved a malicious software update\nfor SolarWinds Orion platform that was downloaded by over 18,000 SolarWinds customers.\nNobelium had managed to compromise the SolarWinds software build environment and used\n[a custom implant called SUNSPOT to load the](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sunspot-malware-technical-analysis/) [SUNBURST backdoor into the Orion software](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0559/)\nupdate. The intrusion reportedly began in September 2019 and had a first attempt in October\n2019 when test code was added and pushed to SolarWinds customers. To make it harder to\ndetect, SUNBURST's code was signed using stolen certificates from the Orion platform and it\nsame naming conventions as Orion’s code so SolarWinds developers would mistake it for\ntheir own. Once installed, SUNBURST would sleep for 12-14 days before it contacted the\ngroup’s C&C domain via DNS. SUNBURST's traffic also used the Orion Improvement\nProgram (OIP) protocol to blend in with legitimate SolarWinds activity. Nobelium would then\n[use SUNBURST to deploy additional malware, such as TEARDROP,](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0560/) [RAINDROP, and](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0565/)\n[several others.

To be able to utilize these techniques, it\nrequires vast resources, technically skilled researchers, and disciplined operators.\nTurla, APT10, and Nobelium are the very definition of advanced persistent threats.\nThese groups operate constantly and stop and nothing to execute intelligence\ngathering campaigns and intellectual property theft.\nThese types of campaigns are essentially the cyber version of traditional spying that\nwill always happen between nation-state rivals. It is difficult to call these types of\nintrusions \"attacks\" because there were no destructive components. However, the\ninformation collected in these cyber-espionage campaigns may support future\ndestructive offensive operations.\n\n**Destructive Cyberattacks affecting Space**\n\n**\".garminwasted\"**\n\nCyberattacks degrading the performance of IT systems and networks are more likely to\noriginate from cybercriminal threat groups than nation-state APTs. In late July 2020, Garmin,\n[a major manufacturer of navigation equipment - used by NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter -](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/blog/garmin-on-mars/)\n[and smart devices was the victim of a WastedLocker ransomware. Garmin's cloud services,](https://securelist.com/wastedlocker-technical-analysis/97944/)\nincluding device syncing and geopositioning instruments used by pilots, were disabled as a\nresult. In its official statement, Garmin [confirmed that it was the victim of the cyberattack that](https://web.archive.org/web/20200725234633/https://www.garmin.com/en-US/outage/)\ninterrupted online services and encrypted some internal systems. Garmin reported that there\nwas no evidence anyone gained unauthorized access to user data during the incident. An\nanonymous Garmin employee familiar with the incident told BleepingComputer that the\n[ransom demand was $10 million. After a four-day global service outage, Garmin suddenly](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/confirmed-garmin-received-decryptor-for-wastedlocker-ransomware/)\n[announced that they were starting to restore services after paying the ransom to the](https://news.sky.com/story/garmin-paid-multi-million-dollar-ransom-to-criminals-using-arete-ir-say-sources-12041468)\ncybercriminals to receive a decryptor. Notably, WastedLocker has been attributed to EvilCorp\nvia its similarities to DoppelPaymer and BitPaymer, other ransomware families developed by\nthe eCrime threat group. In December 2019, EvilCorp was placed on the US OFAC\nsanctions list for causing $100 million in financial damages. Therefore, paying the ransom to\nEvilCorp could lead to heft fines from the US government.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Garmin outage notices and WastedLocker ransom note (Source:\n[BleepingComputer)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/garmin-outage-caused-by-confirmed-wastedlocker-ransomware-attack/)\n\n**World's First SATCOM Attack**\n\nOne of the most destructive cyberattacks in space was against Europe's SATCOM networks\n[on the night of Russian invasion of Ukraine. The US and EU stated that on 24 February](https://www.state.gov/attribution-of-russias-malicious-cyber-activity-against-ukraine/)\n2022, Russia launched cyberattacks against commercial satellite communications networks\nknown as KA-SAT, belonging to Viasat. The cyberattack was aimed to disrupt the Ukrainian\n[command and control operations, and resulted in significant spillover impacts into other](https://www.wired.com/story/viasat-internet-hack-ukraine-russia/)\nEuropean countries, including Germany, Greece, Poland, Italy, and Hungary. Broadband\nservices took over one month to recover from the incident. According to Viasat, tens of\nthousands of [SATCOM modems were destroyed as a result and had to be replaced. The](https://www.viasat.com/about/newsroom/blog/ka-sat-network-cyber-attack-overview/)\nadversaries were reportedly able to gain access via exploiting a \"misconfigured VPN\" and\nmoved laterally to the management segment of the KA-SAT network. From there, the\nattackers executed commands to flash the memory of the modems, rendering them\n[unusable. Interestingly, researchers from cybersecurity vendor SentinelOne uncovered a](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/acidrain-a-modem-wiper-rains-down-on-europe/)\nwiper malware called AcidRain designed for MIPS firmware used by the SATCOM modems\nthat was potentially used in the KA-SAT attack. SentinelOne researchers assess with\nmedium confidence that AcidRain was developed by the same malware authors as\nVPNFilter, which was [officially attributed to the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU),](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-actions-disrupt-advanced-persistent-threat-28-botnet-infected)\n[more specifically GTsST Unit 74455, most well-known as the Sandworm Team.](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/gru-hackers-destructive-malware-and-international-cyber-attacks)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 4: Side-by-side analysis of attacked KA-SAT modems (Source: reversemode)](https://twitter.com/reversemode/status/1509467387954962432)\n**Russian Space Agencies Attacked By Hacktivists**\n\nState-sponsored APT groups and organized cybercriminals are not the only perpetrators of\ndestructive cyberattacks against the space industry. In March 2022, a pro-Ukraine hacktivist\n[group known as Network Battalion 65 (aka NB65) shared via Twitter that it had launched an](https://twitter.com/xxNB65/status/1498563301525102594)\nattack on Roscosmos, Russia's space agency. Dmitry Rogozin, director general of\nRoscosmos, later [Tweeted that NB65's claims were \"not true\" and called them \"scammers](https://twitter.com/Rogozin/status/1498903566135832577)\nand petty swindlers.\" However, the screenshots shared by NB65 allegedly belong to Russian\nsatellite imaging software and vehicle monitoring systems. The incident at Roscosmos was\nultimately denied by officials and unconfirmed by NB65. Also in March, a Twitter account\n[allegedly tied to the Anonymous collective shared that another hacktivist group known as](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3n8ea/hackers-breach-russian-space-research-institute-website)\nv0g3lSec defaced a website belonging to Russia’s Space Research Institute (IKI) and leaked\nfiles that allegedly belong to the Russian space agency Roscosmos. One of the stolen\ndocuments discusses the location of potential landing sites for lunar spacecraft on the\n\n\n-----\n\nMoon s South Pole. This matches with what Russian authorities have already announced\ntheir South Pole sites, which potentially increases the likelihood that these documents were\nsuccessfully stolen.\n\n[Figure 5: NB65 and v0g3lSec attacked Russian Space Agencies (Source: Vice)](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3n8ea/hackers-breach-russian-space-research-institute-website)\n**Analysis: So What?**\n\nAlthough uncommon, purely destructive cyberattacks are often the most feared. The\nloss of data and access to systems can cause millions of dollars of damage to an\norganization and set back operations for months or years. The most destructive attacks\noften include data encrypting ransomware or data destroying wipers.\nRussia has been one of the main sources of destructive cyberattacks globally. Leading\nup to and during the invasion of Ukraine, Russian APT groups have deployed several\ndata wiping malware variants against Ukrainian government entities and Ukrainian\ncritical infrastructure organizations.\nOffensive cyber operations perpetrated by the Sandworm Team are some of the most\ndangerous in the world. It is one of the few APT groups that has successfully launched\nmultiple cyberattacks that had destructive kinetic affects, mostly against Ukraine.\n\n**Courses of Action**\n\nCybersecurity experts have often warned that Russian offensive cyber operations treat\nUkraine like a sandbox, in that new attack types are often tested and proven in the region\nfirst. Therefore, it can be deemed vital for cyber threat intelligence analysts to monitor the\nthreat landscape in Ukraine to capture the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)\nleveraged by Russian APTs before they are deployed elsewhere globally.\n\nThe adversaries targeting space organizations and satellite networks are some of the most\nadvanced in the wild. This includes highly well-resourced intelligence agencies operating on\nbehalf of Russia and China, as well as agencies from hostile states such as Iran and North\nKorea. It is therefore important to recruit and cultivate skilled cybersecurity practitioners to\ncompete with the adversaries and direct investment into technologies to prevent\nsophisticated attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nA lot of the focus has been on nation-state and cybercriminal threat groups, but more focus\nshould be on hacktivists groups that can also cause significant reputational damage to any\norganization. Unlike nation-states that usually try to covertly gain and maintain access or\ncybercriminals who look to monetise their access, hacktivists seek to embarrass an\norganization by defacing websites, shutting down websites by DDoS attacks, or hack-andleak operations to spread unsavoury information publicly. State-backed threat actors have\nalso adopted hacktivists tactics due to the ability to generate headlines with the aim of\nembarrassing their geopolitical opposition.\n\nThe threat model for the space industry is very different for many other verticals. The attack\nsurface involves a lot of advanced technology, such as SATCOM networks, that modern\nvendors are not suited to protect and requires custom solutions. One main example of this is\nthat endpoint security for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices is not currently anywhere near the\nlevel that modern workstations have available. This makes this an area that is woefully\nunderprepared for nation-state advanced persistent threat groups that are going undetected\nand waiting for the time to strike.\n\n## Lessons from the Conti Leaks\n\n Overview of Russian GRU and SVR Cyberespionage Campaigns 1H 2022\n\n How Do You Run A Cybercrime Gang?\n\n\n-----",
