    "plain_text": "# The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\n## History, Patterns and Findings\n\n Executive Overview\nFollowing the public disclosures of electronic attacks launched against Google and\nseveral other businesses, subsequently referred to as “Operation Aurora”, Damballa\nconducted detailed analysis to confirm that existing customers were already protected\nand to ascertain the sophistication of the criminal operators behind the botnet.\n\nThere has been much media attention and speculation as to the nature of the attacks.\nMultiple publications have covered individual aspects of the threat – in particular\ndetailed analysis of forensically recovered malware and explanations of the Advanced\nPersistent Threat (APT).\n\nBy contrast, Damballa has been able to compile an extensive timeline of the attack\ndating back to mid-2009 that identifies unique aspects to the Aurora botnet that have\nbeen previously unknown. Based upon this new information and our experience in\ndealing with thousands of enterprise-targeted botnets, Damballa believes that the\ncriminal operators behind the attack are relatively unsophisticated compared other\nprofessional botnet operators. Even so, the results proved just as damaging as a\nsophisticated botnet since the threat was not quickly identified and neutralized.\n\nKey observations discussed in the main body of this analysis report:\n\n  - The major pattern of attacks previously identified as occurring in mid-December\n2009 targeting Google appear to originate in July 2009 from mainland China.\n\n  - Hosts compromised with Aurora botnet agents and rallied to the botnet\nCommand-and-Control (CnC) channels were distributed across multiple\ncountries before the public disclosure of Aurora, with the top five countries\nbeing the United States, China, Germany, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.\n\n  - Damballa identified additional botnet CnC domains used by these criminal\noperators and established a timeline of malware associations back to May 2nd\n2009 by tracking the evolution of the malware used by Aurora’s operators.\n\n  - Analysis of network traffic associated with the lookups of the botnet CnC is not\nconsistent with the publicly discussed Internet Explorer 6 infection vector.\n\n  - This botnet has a simple command topology and makes extensive use of\nDynamic DNS (DDNS) CnC techniques. The construction of the botnet would be\nclassed as “old-school”, and is rarely used by professional botnet criminal\noperators any more. Reliance upon DDNS CnC is typically associated with new\nand amateur botnet operators\n\n  - The criminals behind the Google attack appear to have built and managed a\nnumber of separate botnets and run a series of targeted attack campaigns in\nparallel. This conclusion is based upon CnC domain registration and\nmanagement information. The earliest of the CnC domains associated with\nthese botnets, reliant upon DDNS service provisioning, appear to have been\nregistered on July 13th 2009.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\n      - The botnet operators had access to large numbers of CnC hosts in geographically diverse\nhosting co-locations from the very start – a fairly high cost for a botnet. Further, the botnet\nemployed over a dozen domains in diverse DDNS networks for CnC. Some of the botnet agents\nfocused on victims outside of Google, suggesting that each domain might have been dedicated\nto a distinct class or vertical of victims.\n\n      - Only the US victims of the attack were compelled to perform mail-based DNS queries – an event\nthat would typically indicate attempted document exfiltration via email services.\n\n      - Damballa identified multiple CnC testing, deployment, management and shutdown phases of\nthe botnet CnC channels. Some of the CnC domains appear to have become dormant for a\nperiod of time after they infected victim systems. This type of activity can sometimes be\nassociated with an update to the botnet malware, or when the criminal operator sells/trades a\nsegment of the botnet to another criminal operator.\n\n      - The botnet operators behind the Aurora attacks deployed other malware families prior to the\nkey Trojan.Hydraq release. Some of these releases overlapped with each other. Two additional\nfamilies of malware (and their evolutionary variants) were identified as “Fake AV Alert /\nScareware – Login Software 2009” and “Fake Microsoft Antispyware Service,” both of which\nemployed fake antivirus infection messages to socially engineer victims into installing malicious\nbotnet agents.\n\nBy studying the evolution of the Google attacks and tracking the malicious campaigns conducted\nbefore (and in parallel to) the public disclosure of “Operation Aurora” in January 2010, Damballa has\nestablished a detailed timeline of infections. Instead of this attack being a sophisticated APT\noperation, it appears that the attacks originated from a Chinese botnet operations team, and that the\nattack vector underwent several different phases of botnet building and malware deployment before\nbeing discovered by Google.\n\nThe fact that some of the later attacks utilized a different family of malware and may have exploited\nZero-Day vulnerabilities within Internet Explorer 6 as one of the infection vectors is typical for modern\nbotnet distribution campaigns. Botnet operators also increasingly trade or sell segments of the\nbotnets they build. Once sold, the owner of the botnet typically deploys a new suite of malware onto\ncompromised systems. The CnC provides the link between various campaigns run by the botnet\noperators and the multiple malware iterations. Since Damballa focuses on malicious, remotecontrolled crimeware that depends on CnC to function, we were able to determine the evolution and\nsophistication of the Aurora botnet and its operators with greater detail and accuracy than other\nreports to-date.\n\nIn general, Aurora is “just another botnet” and typifies the advanced nature of the threat and the\ncriminal ecosystem that supports it. It is important to note, however, that botnets linked to the\ncriminal operators behind Aurora may have been sold or traded to other botnet operators, either in\nsections or on an individual victim basis. This kind of transaction is increasingly popular. Specialist\nbotnet builders sell access to victim systems or networks for a fee – making it very simple for other\nentities to access confidential business systems and information without needing be technologically\nproficient. These transactions between criminals are very difficult to detect.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\n Introduction\nThe progression of semi-autonomous malware into globe-spanning botnets with victims numbering\nin the millions continues to accelerate. In short, botnets, and the criminal ecosystem that supports\nthem, lie at the heart of modern cybercrime. Specialist contractors and service providers occupy every\nonline niche, enabling both newbie hackers and professional botnet operators to overcome\ntechnological hurdles and operational barriers for a small price – typically stolen identities or access to\nhijacked systems rather than dollars.\n\nAll it takes to get started is an Internet search engine and the ability to install software on a computer.\nDevastating attacks start with a nominal fee for acquiring advanced malware construction tools\ncapable of automatically generating customized botnet agents dramatically superior to tools used by\nprofessional hackers only three years ago. Fierce competition within the ecosystem has resulted in the\ncommoditization of these tools and services, which has lowered price points and driven suppliers to\ndifferentiate with 24x7 support, money-back guarantees, replacement warrantees and even SLAs.\n\nMajor international corporations have begun to publicly acknowledge this electronic threat. On\nJanuary 12, 2010, Google announced that it had been the victim of a targeted attack and had\nsubsequently identified over 34 additional organizations that had similarly been breached by the\nsame criminal team. One major industrial powerhouse has publicly focused on the risks posed by\npersistent electronic attacks by including references to these threats in their quarterly 10-K filing.\n\n**_Report Objectives_**\nThe purpose of this report is to explain the advanced state of today’s botnet ecosystem by way of\nexample, and to examine the ways in which criminal operators rely upon botnet technologies to\nbreach corporate networks and extract secrets from their victims. Much media fervor has surrounded\nGoogle’s public disclosure of the successful attacks against their systems. 33 other victims also fell prey\nto what has been frequently referred to as an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). This report closely\nexamines the methods employed by the criminal operators who conducted this botnet campaign.\n\nMany security vendors have explained the operation against Google, dubbed “Operation Aurora,”\nusing a military vernacular. However, based upon analysis of exhaustive data surrounding these\nattacks and examination of both the malware and the CnC topologies used by the criminals behind\nAurora, it appears that this threat can best be classified as a just another common botnet attack – and\none that is more amateur than average.\n\nThis report details new analysis of the malware evolution and the CnC construction behind these\nattacks, and provides unique insight into similar threats facing large business. Comparisons are made\nbetween the Aurora attacks and professionally orchestrated campaigns run by sophisticated cyber\ncriminals. Timelines track the evolution of this threat help to identify the objectives of the criminals\nbehind the Aurora attacks, and illustrate the advanced state of the botnet ecosystem.\n\n**_Understanding Aurora_**\nMalware samples recovered from victim systems using forensic techniques lie at the heart of almost all\npublic analysis of Aurora. The samples directly associated with Aurora are commonly referred to as\nTrojan.Hydraq. Damballa analyzed the Trojan.Hydraq outbreak using DNS monitoring logs obtained\nfrom CnC authority DNS servers. Since every infected host in the Aurora botnet contacted the\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\nauthority server, DNS logs provided a rich inventory of the botnet’s resolution behavior. The logs also\ndelivered insights into the development, gestation and growth of the Aurora botnet. This data leads to\nseveral interesting questions:\n\n**Origins – Which network first resolved the botnet CnC domains? Who was the first victim? Are**\n_there clues in the first DNS lookups as to the authors or origin of the network?_\nThe analysis below shows that a university in China, and a Chinese collocation facility (colo),\nwere critical early incubators of the infection. Portions of the infection originated from within\nGoogle China’s offices.\n\n**Remediation and Damage Assessment –** _Who else resolved the botnet CnC domains before_\n_news of the malware became public? What were the victim systems forced to do?_\nPublic accounts state that the botnet harvested email information. The DNS log analysis\nreveals numerous MX-lookups (mail-related DNS lookups). If these lookups are related to\ndocument theft, it is reasonable to estimate the number and timing of attempted exfiltration\nevents. In addition to the type of DNS traffic, the log analysis also reveals where the victims are\nlocated.\nAlmost all (99%) of these events took place inside Google’s US network. No victim in any other\ncountry performed MX lookups, suggesting Aurora’s data exfiltration targets were all in the\nU.S. The pattern of MX lookups appears automated and lacks any diurnal properties.\n\n**Capabilities – What else does DNS log analysis suggest, and what other questions does it raise**\n_about the attack?_\n\nDamballa’s analysis helps illumine the origin of the botnet, based on years of observing the\nauthority servers used in the Aurora CnC.\n\n**_Previously Disclosed Aurora Knowledge_**\n“Operation Aurora” refers to the investigations of a cyber attack which appeared to have begun in midDecember 2009 and continued through to February 2010. Aurora was first publicly disclosed by\nGoogle on January 12, 2010 – and is commonly associated with attacks originating from China. The\nAurora name was originally publicized by Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of Threat Research at\nMcAfee, and refers to a file path artifact that might reveal what the criminal authors of the malware\nnamed their operation.\n\nKey facts publicly associated with Aurora:\n\na) Google stated that some of their intellectual property had been stolen and publicly\nannounced the attack on January 12th 2010.\nb) While the scope of reported victims includes around 34 organizations, only Google, Adobe\nSystems, Juniper Networks and Rackspace have publicly confirmed that they were targeted.\nVarious media reports have stated that Yahoo, Symantec, Northrop Grumman, Dow Chemical\nand the Rand Corporation were also among the targets.\nc) Many security agencies and experts claim the attack to be a sophisticated use of “advanced”\ntools and techniques – most notably the use of a Zero-Day exploit for a previously unknown\nvulnerability in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer 6 browser technology.\nd) The public name for the malware component that allowed the Aurora criminal operators to\nremotely control their victims system is called Trojan.Hydraq.\ne) The Aurora attacks are widely assumed to be an APT originating from within China.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\n**_Advanced Persistent Threats_**\nAdvanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are a cybercrime category directed at business and political\ntargets. APTs require a high degree of stealithiness over a prolonged duration of operation in order to\nbe successful. The attack objectives therefore typically extend beyond immediate financial gain, and\ncompromised systems continue to be of service even after key systems have been breached and initial\ngoals reached.\n\nDefinitions of precisely what an APT is can vary widely, but can best be summarized by their named\nrequirements:\n\n**Advanced – Criminal operators behind the threat utilize the full spectrum of computer**\nintrusion technologies and techniques. While individual components of the attack may not be\nclassed as particularly “advanced” (e.g. malware components generated from commonly\navailable DIY construction kits, or the use of easily procured exploit materials), their operators\ntypically access and develop more advanced tools as required. They combine multiple attack\nmethodologies and tools in order to reach and compromise their target.\n\n**Persistent – Criminal operators give priority to a specific task, rather than opportunistically**\nseeking immediate financial gain. This distinction implies that the attackers are guided by\nexternal entities. The attack is conducted through continuous monitoring and interaction of a\nbotnet in order to achieve the defined objectives. It does not mean a barrage of constant\nattacks and malware updates. In fact, a “low-and-slow” approach is usually more successful.\n\n**Threat – Means that there is a level of coordinated human involvement in the attack. The**\ncriminal operators have a specific objective and are skilled, motivated, organized and well\nfunded.\n\n**_Damballa’s Perspective_**\nDamballa’s research and technical expertise focuses on the detection of CnC tethering and the\nmalicious communications between a victim’s computer and the remote criminal operator. Damballa\ndetects new botnet CnC channels as they are created and used by criminal operators. This globespanning array of network sensors monitors CnC use to identify victims that join botnets.\n\nDamaballa used key DNS observations about the operational characteristics of Dynamic DNS zones\n(e.g. zone cuts, TTL changes, NS changes, etc.) in order to identify the different states in which the\nbotnet was operated by its criminal controllers. Changes in the way that a DNS zone is structured by\ncriminals typically denotes an intension to develop, test, and operate malicious infrastructure, or\nabandon a particular zone and move to a new one. Damballa also reviewed historical DNS resolution\ndata derived from our passive observation systems to identify when (and how frequently) the CnC\ndomain names associated with the Aurora botnet were queried. This information provided valuable\ninsight into the pace at which victims rallied to the botnet and established a timeline for Aurora.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\n1000000\n\n100000\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n\n7/1/2009 8/1/2009 9/1/2009 10/1/2009 11/1/2009 12/1/2009 1/1/2010\n\n**Figure 1: Cumulative volume of CnC domain name resolutions. Absolute numbers do not represent**\n**individual victims (i.e. victim computers make repeated lookups based upon the TTL of the CnC**\n**domain and relative malware activity on the system), but do depict approximately when the CnC**\n**domains were first used by the Aurora botnet. From this passive DNS resolution dataset, that date**\n**appears to be June 14, 2009.**\n\nThese network observations combine with Damballa’s ability to identify Zero-Day remote access\nmalware and botnet agents within customers’ networks to determine additional CnC relationships.\nZero-Day malware samples are automatically passed to Damballa’s analysis cloud – along with tens-ofthousands of new malware variants obtained through industry security sharing programs. These\nnetwork behaviors are extracted, and provide Damballa with additional insight into CnC evolution and\ncriminal ownership. They also allow us to cluster various malware and botnet agents automatically\nwith their respective criminal operators – despite factors such as serial variant production, migrations\nto new malware families and sub-contracting malware development to other criminal authors.\n\nTrojan.Hydraq is the name of a family of malware now synonymous with Operation Aurora. To date,\nonly a handful of related samples have been made public by various security vendors – almost all of\nwhich were gathered through forensic analysis of compromised computers. However, it is important\nto understand that not only are there multiple variants of malware within the Trojan.Hydraq family, but\nthat criminal operators also use(d) other malware families in their attacks. Based upon analysis of\nsamples and data gathered by Damballa, malware associated with the criminal operators behind the\nAurora botnet can be traced back to August 2009.\n\nA holistic DNS forensic analysis of any botnet that utilizes DNS as a critical communication element\nrequires DNS information from both the iterative and recursive DNS phases. Utilizing large scale\npassive DNS information from large ISPs and DNS traces from a significant portion of the CnC’s DNS\nauthority servers (ANS) Damballa has identified more than many infected hosts that attempted to\nconnect or rally to the five CnC domain names associated with the Aurora botnet and investigated in\nthis report. These hosts where distributed across multiple countries at the time of the public Google\ndisclosure (January 12, 2010).\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\n**_Position_** **_Country_**\n\n1 United States\n\n2 China\n\n3 Germany\n\n4 Taiwan\n\n5 United Kingdom\n\n**Table 1: Top 5 countries with Aurora botnet victims**\n\nDamballa’s passive DNS data collection indicates that the infection vector was not centralized, and that\na significant number of infected assets tried to look up CnC domain names throughout the US, with a\nhigher frequency in the Northeast.\n\n**Figure 2: Volume of DNS queries per Aurora CnC domain associated with the attacks within the USA,**\n**by geographic region**\n\nSome interesting observations can be made about the lifetime and “popularity” of the CnC domains\nused. The next figure shows that portions of the CnC domain names were active since the beginning\nof September 2009 (e.g. google.homelinux.com, yahoo.blogdns.net, mcsmc.org).\nThese domain names reveal two important trends – a downward-spike during the month of October\nand a steady hit rate for the remaining months. Beside these long-lived CnC domain names, Damballa\nobserved a number of domain names that become active in the early days of November. Some of\nthem were active only for a couple of months (e.g. filoups.info), while others where active longer\n\n|Position|Country|\n|---|---|\n|1|United States|\n|2|China|\n|3|Germany|\n|4|Taiwan|\n|5|United Kingdom|\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\n(e.g. m7been.zapto.org, baltika1.servebeer.com, etc.) before they where sinkholed by\ncorresponding DNS operators.\n\n**Figure 3: Volume of DNS resolution queries per Aurora botnet, per month. Spikes in query volume**\n**typically indicate growth of a botnet and renewed CnC interaction.**\n\n## The Major Components\nBotnets are a business. Professional criminal operators employ specialist tools, services and\nmethodologies to conduct their botnet operations. While botnet discussion has been tied malware\nfamilies in the past (e.g. “The Conficker Botnet”, “The Koobface Botnet”), today’s botnet operators\nregularly employ multiple families of malware, considering them disposable attack tools. The key\nelements of a botnet are:\n\n**Malware – The tool used by botnet operators to conduct malicious activities on victims’**\ncomputers and to provide remote control capabilities.\n\n**CnC – The electronic tether between the criminal operator, a control server and victims’**\ncomputers.\n\n**CnC Domain – The domain name of the host being used for CnC conduct or to route**\ncommunications between the control server and the victim’s computer.\n\n**CnC Server – The server used by the botnet operators to rally and provide electronic tethers to**\nvictim computers.\n\n**Botnet – The collective name for malware-infected victims with established connections to a**\nCnC server and remotely controlled by criminal operators.\n\n**Criminal Operators – The person or team that builds, manages and reaps financial reward**\nfrom a botnet.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\n**_How Advanced Persistent Threats Breach Enterprises_**\nAPTs breach enterprises through a wide variety of vectors, even in the presence of properly designed\nand maintained defense-in-depth strategies:\n\n      - Internet-based malware infection\n\n      - Physical malware infection\n\n      - External exploitation\n\nWell funded APT adversaries do not necessarily need to breach perimeter security controls from an\nexternal perspective. They can, and often do, leverage “insider threat” and “trusted connection” vectors\nto access and compromise targeted systems.\n\nAbuse and compromise of “trusted connections” is a key ingredient for many APTs. While the targeted\norganization may employ sophisticated technologies in order to prevent infection and compromise of\ntheir digital systems, criminal operators often tunnel into an organization using the hijacked\ncredentials of employees or business partners, or via less-secured remote offices. As such, almost any\norganization or remote site may fall victim to an APT and be utilized as a soft entry or information\nharvesting point.\n\nA key requirement for APTs (as opposed to an “everyday” botnet) is to remain invisible for as long as\npossible. As such, the criminal operators of APT technologies tend to focus on “low and slow” attacks –\nstealthily moving from one compromised host to the next, without generating regular or predictable\nnetwork traffic – to hunt for specific data or system objectives. Tremendous effort is invested to ensure\nthat malicious actions cannot be observed by legitimate operators of these systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\nMalware is a key ingredient in successful APT operations. Modern “off-the-shelf” and commercial\nmalware includes all of the features and functionality necessary to infect digital systems, hide from\nhost-based detection systems, navigate networks, capture and extricate key data, provide video\nsurveillance and deliver silent covert channels for remote control. APT operators often use custom\nmalware tools to achieve specific objectives and harvest information from non-standard systems.\n\nAt the very heart of every APT lies remote control functionality. Criminal operators need this capability\nin order to navigate to specific hosts within target organizations, exploit and manipulate local systems,\nand gain continuous access to critical information. If an APT cannot connect with its criminal\noperators, then it cannot transmit any intelligence it may have captured. In effect, it has been\nneutered. This characteristic makes APTs appear as a sub-category of botnets.\n\nWhile APT malware can remain stealthy at the host level, the network activity associated with remote\ncontrol is more easily identified. As such, APTs are most effectively identified, contained and disrupted\nat the network level.\n\n**_Controlling the Victim_**\nOnce the victim’s computer has been compromised, the malware component will typically establish its\nfirst CnC session to register itself with the botnet CnC server. In order for this to occur, the botnet\noperator must correctly set up the CnC servers and also configure appropriate resolution services such\nas registering domain names and configuring DNS resolution settings.\n\nDepending upon the sophistication of the botnet operators, this CnC infrastructure can take on many\ndifferent forms, with each alternative offering varying degrees of robustness and flexibility. Readers\nare encouraged to read Damballa’s earlier whitepaper titled, “Botnet Communication Topologies:\nUnderstanding the Intricacies of Botnet Command-and-Control,” for more information on this topic.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\nDetailed analysis of DNS intricacies for CnC domain name querying and management follow.\n\n**_Key Concepts: DNS Overview_**\nDNS resolution can be generally viewed as having two phases – a private stub (or “recursive”) layer,\nand a public authoritative (or “iterative”) layer.\n\n**Figure 4: Conceptual view of Aurora DNS lookups and multiple monitoring opportunities. Damballa**\n**used the convenience of an authority monitoring system to gather [qr aa] responses.**\n\nThe figure above illustrates how Aurora victims performed DNS lookups, and provides a simplified\ndelegation tree for several of the Aurora-related CnC domains. An Aurora authority DNS zone is\ndepicted: the light blue zone delegated to No-IP. The No-IP zone has been simplified in the diagram to\ninclude the authority DNS servers, nf[1-4].no-ip.com, as well as the actual Aurora CnC domain,\nblog1.servebeer.com, even though in practice these are separate delegations from the .com TLD\nparent. An infected host is depicted in the light green area. Its resolution path consists of the virus\ncode (designated as VX), a local stub resolver (often available through various statically named or\nrandom DLL files on Windows hosts), and a local recursive DNS server. The “private” portions of DNS\ntraffic occur within this local envelope, colored as the light green area. No DNS monitoring takes place\nhere, in part because of the possible presence of PII, and because of the staggering volume of traffic\nmonitoring might entail, for even a small network. Such networks often generate billions of queries\nper day below the recursive.\n\nWhen a victim attempts to contact the Aurora CnC domain blog1.servebeer.com, it must first\ndiscover the delegation of the zone to the No-IP authority name servers. (To save space, these steps\nare not shown in the figure above). The overall delegation of authority is shown in the figure as a tree.\nThe hosts nf[1-4].no-ip.com are the authorities for the CnC zone. Thus, the victim network’s\nrecursive server discovers these name servers, queries for the Aurora CnC domain, and caches the\nanswer.\n\n**_Dynamic DNS and IP-Agility_**\nBotnets have used Dynamic DNS services (DDNS) for nearly 8 years. For the most part, the role of\nDDNS in professional, criminal botnets is historic. Concentrated cleanup efforts and a few well\ndocumented arrests have changed the class of botmaster using DDNS. For the most part, professional\ncyber criminals do not use DDNS for botnet rallying, since DDNS providers:\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\na) are generally responsive to law enforcement;\n\nb) keep logs; and\n\nc) a few are famously known to actively monitor and remediate their networks.\n\nSince 2007, most “professional criminal” botnet CnCs (e.g., Russian mafia) have moved away from\nDDNS, because of the aggressive stance taken by the major DDNS providers against botnet abuse.\nWhile there has been a recent return of novice botmasters to the free DNS services, the professional\ncriminal botmasters have largely moved on to more resilient, agile DNS technologies. For example,\nprofessional botnets buy tens of thousands of domain names, and use domain agility instead of the IP\nagility found in DDNS. The best example of this is Conficker.C. The decline in “professional” botnet use\nof DDNS services has been so dramatic that many anti-botnet researchers changed their focus to new\nareas of threat.\n\nThe average botmaster still using DDNS is generally a novice, and the malware they seed on victim\nmachines is often kit-generated. There are a few exceptions where amateur botmasters evolve into\nprofessionals, but the bulk of botnets relying upon DDNS remain novice efforts, and use only a few\ndomain names with a single DDNS provider.\n\nThe Aurora botnet uses DDNS and “old school” coordination techniques not used by sophisticated\nbotmasters who have the means to purchase and manage dozens of domain names. And yet despite\nhaving the signature of a novice effort, it also used numerous different DDNS services.\n\n## Network Analysis\nThe network analysis in this report encompasses the CnC domain names known to be publicly\nassociated with the Aurora attacks, plus an additional four non-public domains (listed below) which\nare related to the criminal operators behind the Aurora attacks through shared DDNS registration\ncredentials and their synchronized management.\n\n**Domain** **Authority Creation Date (UTC)**\n\nCnC_Domain.1 December 15, 2009\n\nCnC_Domain.2 December 15, 2009\n\nCnC_Domain.3 July 13, 2009\n\nCnC_Domain.4 December 15, 2009\n\nblog1.servebeer.com December 15, 2009\n\n**Table 2: DDNS botnets with characteristics identical to the Aurora botnet and shared**\n**DDNS credentials. The first four of these CnC domains have been intentionally**\n**obscured.**\n\nThe DNS TTL data associated with these interlinked Aurora domain names reveals that there were\ndifferent phases to their use. The figure below indicates when a particular CnC domain name was\nsinkholed or idle (i.e. not pointing to a specific Internet IP address, or pointing to a local loopback\naddress such as 127.0.0.1), it was pointing at probable development IP addresses as the criminal\noperators experimented with their attack tools, such as when the CnC domain names were pointing at\nthe IP addresses associated with two of the CnC servers used during the Aurora attack.\n\n|Domain|Authority Creation Date (UTC)|\n|---|---|\n|CnC_Domain.1|December 15, 2009|\n|CnC_Domain.2|December 15, 2009|\n|CnC_Domain.3|July 13, 2009|\n|CnC_Domain.4|December 15, 2009|\n|blog1.servebeer.com|December 15, 2009|\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\n**Figure 5: CnC domain name transition changes as the attackers developed botnet attacks.**\n\nBased upon passively obtained DNS resolution data from sensors scattered around the globe (but\npredominantly US based), Damballa observed that several key CnC domains resolved to different\nserver IP addresses over the period of study. The transitions from one IP address to another can be\nused to identify the different phases of botnet development (e.g. as depicted in the figure above), as\nwell as the nature of the CnC servers hosting and botnet topology (e.g. whether parts of the CnC\nnetwork were using fast-flux services). The table below lists the number of IP address changes to the\nCnC domain name resolution – and is a lower bound number, since Damballa does not monitor all\nInternet traffic.\n\n**CnC Domain Name** **Distinct IP Addresses**\n\nbaltika1.servebeer.com 50\n\nm7been.zapto.org 50\n\nmiecros.info 4\n\nmcsmc.org 3\n\nyahoo.blogdns.net 5\n\nfiloups.info 2\n\ngoogle.homeunix.com 2\n\n**Table 3: The number of distinct IP addresses observed by Damballa and associated**\n**with each of the CnC domain names for the period of August 2009 to the Google**\n**Aurora disclosure on January 12, 2010.**\n\n|CnC Domain Name|Distinct IP Addresses|\n|---|---|\n|baltika1.servebeer.com|50|\n|m7been.zapto.org|50|\n|miecros.info|4|\n|mcsmc.org|3|\n|yahoo.blogdns.net|5|\n|filoups.info|2|\n|google.homeunix.com|2|\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\n**_Overview of CnC Domains_**\nNot all of the authority servers hosted by the DDNS providers for this botnet were monitored by\nDamballa and sampling practices were adopted for this analysis. In general, for large botnets, the\nsampling this produces is more than adequate to detect “professional cyber criminal botnets.”\n\nAround 5,236 recursive DNS servers visiting the Aurora CnC authorities used BIND. The table below\nlists the major types. Damballa identified a signature specific to Chinese closed recursive DNS servers\nthat provides policy insight to some selected resolvers.\n\nThe table below provides counts of queries from recursive DNS servers for both ISO-3166 country code\nand qtype. All data was gathered on or before January 11, 2010 (the eve of the Google public\nannouncement) to avoid polluting queries from the press and researchers. It is estimated that Google\ndiscovered this attack in mid to late December, 2009, so some of the resolution traffic could be\nassociated with their internal remediation.\n\nThe table also demonstrates that only US victims were required to perform MX queries, hinting at data\nextraction via SMTP mail services.\n\n**Query Type** **US** **CN** **Others**\n\n15 (MX) 143,015 0 0\n\n1 (A) 52,787 644 676\n\n28 (AAAA) 12,254 84 0\n\n**Table 4: Breakdown of qtype by country code of recursive, for all five studied Aurora botnet CnCs.**\n**Highlights: (a) Only the US victims were compelled to perform MX queries (qtype 15); all networks in**\n**China and other countries never performed an MX query; (b) No AAAA (qtype 28) queries were**\n**performed by international victims, who were presumably collateral victims; the pairing of AAAA to A**\n**queries is discussed below; and (c) Most queries were MX (68% overall), and the attack heavily biased**\n**towards the US (also 68 % overall).**\n\n**_CnC Domains over Time_**\nDamballa’s analysis of DNS data has revealed the very early origin (July 2009) of the botnet. Even\nduring this early deployment, the botnet was widely dispersed. Since these were the first DNS\nresolutions for these attacks, it is reasonable to assume they are associated with the botmaster (e.g.,\ntesting or configuring their attack), and not victims. Thus, these resolutions might correspond to\nseveral CnC sites. If this theory is correct, it suggests that, despite using “naive” DDNS services typical of\nnovice botnet operators, the Aurora botmasters had considerable resources available to them.\n\n**CnC_Domain.1**\nThe first resolution for CnC_Domain.1 came from within Google China’s offices. It was followed\nhours later by resolutions inside Google’s offices in Mountain View, California. The pattern of lookups is\nremarkable, and is worth closer study. The first queries for CnC_Domain.1 were:\n\n2009-12-16 05:26:44 AAAA (Google China)\n2009-12-17 22:39:09 AAAA (Google Mountain View)\n2009-12-17 22:39:09 A (Google Mountain View)\n\n|Query Type|US|CN|Others|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|15 (MX)|143,015|0|0|\n|1 (A)|52,787|644|676|\n|28 (AAAA)|12,254|84|0|\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\n_Counting Attempted Exfiltration Events_\nOther patterns of DNS messages in CnC_Domain.1 suggest the attempted exfiltration of data.\nConsider this ordering of queries:\n\n2009-12-18 06:29:09 MX (Google Mountain View)\n2009-12-18 06:29:09 A (Google Mountain View)\n\nThe queries both happen in under a second, indicating that a host using a recursive resolver wished to\nsend email to the CnC_Domain.1 CnC (hence the MX lookup). Dynamic DNS zones, however, almost\n_never have valid MX RRsets, or if they do they are pointed to abuse@traps or spamtraps. Only a few_\nDDNS providers offer mail, and the first query was therefore answered with an empty record\n(NOERROR status, with zero answers). As a result, the victim immediately performed an A query, to use\nthe IP address for email. Whether these queries were followed by actual or successful email events is\nnot known.\n\nAll MX queries in CnC_Domain.1 came from the United States (and no other network outside the\nUS performed such a query before the news broke). Before January 10th 2010, some 110,810 MX\nqueries came from Google Mountain View, and one came from Comcast (San Jose). This Comcastbased query may have been testing by a Google security engineer, or it may have been an infection on\na notebook after work (since the query took place in the late evening hours, PST).\n\nFrom the volume of messages, it is presumed that each MX query corresponds to a single email\nexfiltration attempt. It would be hard to imagine a botmaster being able to direct these events\nindividually. Thus, it may not be the case that bots were instructed to email materials when a specific\nevent took place. Or the consistent pattern of queries could be the result of persistent searches of a\nhard drive, and attempted, periodic exfiltration of any useful data. This conclusion is speculation.\n\nThe lack of any diurnal pattern to these events does indicate that the trigger event for an MX lookup\nwas not human-driven (e.g., the arrival of email on a victim machine, or selected actions by the\nbotmaster). It is not known what information was taken, if any, or if these queries were in fact victim\nbehavior. Public accounts from Google indicate that the attackers sought email records of human\nrights activists.\n\nIt is speculated that Google would have prevented the “direct-to-MX” behavior of hosts within their\nnetwork. That is, in many corporate networks, individual user machines are prohibited from sending\nemail directly, and must instead use a smart host or authenticated relay system. Thus, these MX\nlookups may well be side effect of an unsuccessful exfiltration effort. The malware also used ports 443\nand 8585 for CnC, and could be instructed to perform any command.\n\n**CnC_Domain.3**\nThe CnC_Domain.3 CnC domain is interesting because of its age. The botnet dates back to July 14,\n2009, fell dormant for months, and then became active again within Google’s network. Of the five CnC\ndomains studied in detail within this report, this is the oldest, and most strongly suggests an origin for\nthe botnet.\n\nThe early queries for the Aurora CnC domain CnC_Domain.3 took place in the HangZhou region,\nwith some occurring in Beijing. The domain had a remarkable number of queries from mainland China\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\nand collocation facilities in the US within minutes of being created. Seconds later, another query came\nfrom Chinanet’s network in the Chongqing area. The close timing of these suggests the owners of\nCnC_Domain.3 had access to ISP, university, and commercial transit.\n\n2009-07-14 02:50:03 A (HiNet Taiwan)\n2009-07-14 02:57:38 A (CHINANET Jiangsu)\n2009-07-14 02:58:31 A (CHINANET HangZhou)\n2009-07-14 03:03:11 A (HangZhou Institute of Electronic Engineering)\n2009-07-14 03:03:44 A (CHINANET Chongqing)\n2009-07-14 03:04:28 A (FDC Servers, US Chicago)\n2009-07-14 03:13:18 A (Level 3, US Washington)\n\nThe pattern of these lookups suggests that the author was performing testing, and had access to two\ndifferent transits (e.g., a school network and an ISP).\n\n**CnC_Domain.2**\nThe first query for the CnC_Domain.2 domain came from Google’s Mountain View recursive.\n\n2009-12-17 22:39:09 AAAA (Google Mountain View)\n2009-12-18 06:27:58 MX (Google Mountain View)\n2009-12-18 06:27:58 A (Google Mountain View)\n2009-12-18 18:15:18 AAAA (Comcast; San Jose)\n2009-12-18 18:15:18 A (Comcast; San Jose)\n2009-12-18 18:15:18 MX (Comcast; San Jose)\n2009-12-18 18:19:30 AAAA (Google-IT)\n2009-12-18 18:19:30 A (Google-IT)\n\nThe CnC_Domain.2 CnC domain is also notable because it witnessed queries from many other\nnetworks outside of Google before the public news broke. This domain has never been identified\npublicly as part of Aurora. Networks performing queries up to January 10, 2010 include numerous ISPs.\n\n**_Observed Loss of Queries_**\nWhen a botnet is remediated at the DNS level, the associated victims continue to query the authority\nDNS server. Unless and until the local network cleans the hosts or imposes network blocks, victim\ntraffic to the authority will continue. A sudden loss of network traffic from a country, however, can be\nunusual, particularly where the victims are spread over disparate (heterogeneous policy) networks.\n\nThat is, it is unlikely that many different networks would simultaneously remediate hosts. Thus, while it\nmay seem likely that all victims in a single network disappear (e.g., as when a network operator\ndeploys a firewall rule), it is remarkable when all victims in diverse policy boundaries also disappear.\nSuch centralized control speaks to the management of the botnet, and gives clues as to the policy\npreferences of the botmaster to attack/not attack a given suite of networks or countries.\n\nHosts performing DNS queries exhibited a random pattern of A queries. The TTL periods for the CnC\ndomains was always short, meaning there was only a short period of time during which a stub query\ncould be answered from cache, and not recorded at the authority. This behavior is typical of fast flux\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\nnetworks. An increase in TTL from 60 to 360 seconds was identified, which signifies the cut over from\nthe default zone TTL to the SOA.minimum used for wildcarded domains. Thus, the DDNS domains\nused in the attack appear to have been deregistered before December 18 and remained “open” for\nanyone in the world to register until the first week of January 2010.\n\n## The Malware Evolution\nAurora malware families date as far back as August of 2009. This trail helps determine the evolution\nand common characteristics of malware used by Operation Aurora, as well as a common modus\noperandi on the bot agents deployed as part of the attacks. The result is more than just an analysis of\nindividual malware families. Rather, it helps profile the criminal operators behind Aurora via:\n\n**Malware Delivery Method – How does the malware get into the system? Is there a common**\ndelivery method or is it random?\n\n**System Behavior – Are the symptoms evident in the system common to all Aurora malware**\nfamilies or do they differ? Do the families use the same infection techniques, protection\nmechanisms and/or AV evasion techniques?\n\n**Network Behavior –Do the malware families exhibit the same network behavior?**\n\n**_CnC Server Trials Powered by Zero-Day Malware Variants_**\nThe table below lists significant events in the deployment and use of one of the Aurora botnet CnC\nservers known to the public, filoups.info, based on our data mining and analysis of malware\nsamples and network traffic collected by Damballa. Several initial trials were conducted by the botnet\noperator prior to the “production” use of this CnC server.\n\nThe first set of CnC domains appeared in a FakeAV Trojan malware family1-a in the beginning of May\n2009. There were several variants of the family1 malware in the wild in 2009. The second set of CnC\ndomains was used by a new family1-b malware variant in October 2009. By leveraging new Zero-Day\nmalware variants, the botnet operator(s) could easily evade AV product detection and experiment\nwith different CnC domain construction and communication. For example, different combinations of\nCnC domains were tried by both family1-c and family1-d malware variants in late October 2009.\nFinally, the CnC domain filoups.info was deployed and used by malware family1-e in November 2009.\n\n**Domain** mcsmc.org X X X X X\n\nthcway.info X X\n\nmiecros.info X\n\nmnprfix.cn X\n\nmicronetsys.org X\n\nfiloups.info X\n\n**MD5** family1-a family1-b family1-c family1-d family1-e\n\n**Date** 5/2/2009 8/18/2009 10/20/2009 10/22/2009 11/26/2009\n\n**Table 5: Botnet CnC trial evolution powered by Zero-Day malware variants.**\n\n|Domain|mcsmc.org|X|X|X|X|X|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||thcway.info|X|X||||\n||miecros.info|||X|||\n||mnprfix.cn||||X||\n||micronetsys.org||||X||\n||filoups.info|||||X|\n|MD5||family1-a|family1-b|family1-c|family1-d|family1-e|\n|Date||5/2/2009|8/18/2009|10/20/2009|10/22/2009|11/26/2009|\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\nThe family1-e malware is part of Fake AV Alert/Scareware family analyzed below. The behavior of Fake\nAlert/Scareware is quite similar to Trojan.Hydraq malware associated with the actual Aurora attacks,\nalbeit in a much more primitive form.\n\n**_Sample Analysis Details_**\nThe additional samples in Damballa’s possession that have been clustered as part of Aurora botnet\nmalware can be separated into two distinct families of Fake AV Alert / Scareware: Login Software 2009\nand Microsoft Antispyware Services. The first samples of each family were discovered by Damballa on\nNovember 26 2009 and August 19, 2009 respectively. The analysis details are broken down into the\nfollowing:\n\n**First Discovered – The time when the sample was first discovered and acquired by Damballa.**\n\n**Prevalence – The date range when the samples are still being seen in the wild by Damballa.**\n\n**Infection Vector – How the samples are delivered to the unsuspecting victims.**\n\n**Symptoms – Observable behaviors in the system that signals the possible presence of**\nmalware without actually looking at the registry or searching for the malware file itself.\n\n**System Behavior – How the malware works its way through the system to execute its**\nobjective.\n\n**Network Behavior – A detailed look at how the malware utilizes the domains it connects to.**\n\n**Protection Mechanism – How the malware hides from the user or system inspection tools.**\n\n**AV Evasion Techniques – How the malware protects itself from being detected by AV host**\nsolutions.\n\n**Intent – The main purpose of the malware family**\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\n|Col1|Fake AV Alert / Scareware – Login Software 2009|Fake Microsoft Antispyware Service|\n|---|---|---|\n|Discovered|2009-11-26|2009-08-19|\n|Prevalence|November 2009 – January 2010|August 2009 – September 2009|\n|Infection Vector|Fake AV alerts on compromised or malicious Web sites|Fake AV / Scareware|\n|Symptoms| Login Software 2009 process in startup  Menu Bar and Toolbar of Internet Explorer is missing  System Restore is disabled  Folder Options in Windows Explorer is disabled  Extensions of known file types are hidden  Registry Tools disabled, rendering registry editing inoperable  “Local Settings” folder under “C:\\Documents and Settings\\<User>\\” (where the malware dropper places the dropped and downloaded executables)  Presence of “C:\\Documents and Settings\\<User>\\Windows\\system” folder  Pop-up ads  Presence of tracking cookies and displays ads from: – counter.surfcounters.com – looksmart.com – maxsun.biz – moreverde.com – oranges88.com – smarttechnik.com – www.prma-enhance.com|Microsoft Antispyware Services process in startup|\n|System Behavior|Malware propagates through fake malware alerts.

To ensure that the malware is downloaded, the creator of this malware dropper uses redundancy in its malware serving Web infrastructure. The dropper checks three different Web sites:  mcsmc.org  micronetsys.org  mnprfix.cn When Damballa discovered this malware dropper in August 2009, the downloaded executable was version 0. The current version is 3. The functionalities remain similar. After the successful download of the main component, the main dropper generates a random name and copies the downloaded component to “C:\\Documents and Settings\\<User>\\Local Settings” folder. It calls itself Login Software 2009. The dropped file is then executed to make it active in memory. It survives reboot by autostarting using a common registry entry: HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run The rest of the components must also be downloaded and executed for them to be active. They are placed in the same folder as the first dropped file. These components create exact copies of themselves with names varying from:  debug.exe  mqbxt.exe  msinits.exe  win16.exe  winlogon.exe  lsass.exe  drweb.exe  taskmgr.exe  win32.exe| EXE – The component posing as Microsoft Antispyware Services  VXD – The main dropper downloads and installs ntconf32.vxd, ntsys32.vxd, msimsg32.vxd  SYS –The main dropper downloads and installs msconfig32.sys Once the dropper has executed, it can easily bypass UAC since it is given explicit permission by the user, who thought the installation was a real AV product. The first thing the dropper does is to connect to its malware server domain to download its components. The VXD components are often connected to malware families that have keylogging and spyware behavior. They are also found in some IRC bots. The SYS Component is related to the publicly known and notoriously popular Aurora variant tied to the Google attack. The EXE component disguises itself as Microsoft Antispyware Services. It runs on Startup using two basic registry keys: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVers ion\\Run and HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\ Run This screen capture shows the dropper attempting to connect to Amazon EC2.|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\n|Col1|These components are hidden from the user by hiding the folder where they are dropped and changing the attributes of the dropped files to hidden. To survive reboot, these components also are set to autostart using the same technique as the main dropped file. A DLL file is also dropped in “C:\\Windows\\System32” with a random filename. Aside from registering (regsvr32.exe) the dropped DLL file to make it active, the malware dropper also modifies the registry to see it as a Browser Helper Object (BHO). It also sets up the DLL to autostart every boot up by using SharedTaskScheduler: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\ SharedTaskScheduler This process paves the way for tracking cookies to be downloaded for ads to be served to the compromised host. This DLL is not hidden unlike the other components. After setting up all the dropped files, the main dropper protects the dropped files by manipulating the settings of Windows Explorer and Internet Explorer. See Protection Mechanism section for more details. Once all of these “malware installation” tasks are completed by the main dropper, the main dropper activates a batch file to unload itself from memory and deletes both the dropper and the batch file.

The newer family came\nimmediately 2 months after the older family, and there was no overlap in their prevalence. For the\nolder family, there was neither an observable protection mechanism nor an AV evasion technique. It\nwas simply a dropper for keylogger files. The newer family has some protection mechanisms and AV\nevasion techniques. However, it lacks the sophistication found in other botnet malware families.\n\nBelow is a summary of the findings of the two malware families that were analyzed.\n\nCommon characteristics:\n\n1. Served through fake AV hosting Web sites (no longer available)\n2. Common autostart techniques\n3. Common older stealth techniques\n4. Multiple malware server domains to improve resiliency\n5. Droppers and dropped files (EXE and DLLs) were compiled using Microsoft compilers\n\nDifferences:\n\n1. Main malware component:\n\na. November 2009 Family – uses DLL file as one of its components\nb. August 2009 Family – uses VXD and SYS files\n\n2. Main function:\n\na. November 2009 Family – pop-up ads\nb. August 2009 Family – Suspected keylogger (actual files are no longer available for\nanalysis)\n\n3. Protection Mechanism:\n\na. November 2009 Family – uses basic protection mechanisms to hide itself\nb. August 2009 Family – none observed\n\nComparing them to Trojan.Hydraq:\n\n1. Code obfuscation\n\n         - Trojan.Hydraq uses “spaghetti code” in which program elements are separated into small\nchunks and connected via jump instructions. This technique complicates following the\ncode, and is similar to the tactics employed in old PE viruses that write to small spaces in\nthe host and connect themselves through jump instructions.\n\n         - November 2009 Family – Does not use any code obfuscation. One dropped file is\nactually packed using FSG v1.33.\n\n         - August 2009 Family – None observed.\n\n2. Autostart Technique\n\n         - Trojan.Hydraq uses Svchost process in Windows by adding its service name in “netsvcs”.\nWhen Windows starts, it will load the service into memory.\n\n         - November 2009 Family – Uses common autostart technique using the “Run” key.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\n         - August 2009 Family – Uses common autostart technique using the “Run” key.\n\n3. Intent / Payload\n\n         - Trojan.Hydraq – Information gathering\n\n         - November 2009 Family – Pops up ads and Web site redirector\n\n         - August 2009 Family – Information gathering\n\n**_Malware Significance_**\nBasing on the profile of the two malware families that were analyzed, they are obviously different from\neach other. The key thing they have in common is that the CnC they utilize are publicly associated with\nthe Aurora botnet.\n\nThe botnet controllers preyed on the fear of users that their system is infected with malware. This\nmethod saves the botnet controllers from the technical complexity of bypassing Windows’ UAC by\nusing the weakest link in host security – which is the user. The misled user typically clicks OK to\neverything, bypassing UAC and giving the malware dropper explicit permission to execute.\n\nNeither of the malware predecessor families exhibit the sophistication found in newer malware. Some\nof the evasion techniques are almost a decade old. Both families use two sets of domains: one for\nserving malware and the other for CnC.\n\nThe droppers and dropped files were compiled using Microsoft Compilers. This is evidenced by the\npresence of the string “Rich” before the PE header. This watermark is undocumented, meaning there is\nno mention of this watermark from Microsoft references but they are present in binaries compiled\nusing Microsoft Compilers. Knowing the compiler of choice might help investigators narrow down the\nindividuals or group of individuals responsible for the code.\n\nThe simplicity and relative obsolescence of the early versions of the Aurora malware suggest that\nthese malware families were created or written by an individual or group of individuals new to the\nproduction of commercial grade malware. Based solely on these families of malwares, it also appears\nthat different individuals or group of individuals created the code:\n\n      - The only association the different families have with each other is that they used CnCs\nassociated with Operation Aurora, and they were distributed via similar means. That said, it is\npossible that two different groups purchased the services of the same crimeware group\n(probably the same people behind Operation Aurora) to distribute and manage their malware\nfamily. Or the crimeware group rented out different variants of the same malware to different\ngroups with different intentions. Price may also be a factor. The less resilient the malware family\nis, the cheaper it is to purchase or rent.\n\n      - The intent of each malware family is different.\n\n      - There is no natural progression seen between the two families. Usually malware writers evolve in\nboth technology and protection of their creation but these two families did not show any\nrelated evolution. The malware families appear to exist independently, and then become\nsuperseded by Trojan.Hydraq.\n\n## Piecing it Together\nDamballa analyzed network DNS information from a number of distinct and complementary sources\nranging from global monitoring systems, enterprise monitoring sensors, passive DNS resolution data\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\nand other DNS streams for this report. At the same time, Damballa also analyzed the malware\ncommonly associated with the Aurora attacks disclosed by Google in January. The result has been a\ndefinite correlation between key CnC channels with other malware families that are associated with\nthe criminal operators behind the Aurora botnet.\n\nBased upon our analysis of this attack and the surrounding evidence currently available, we classify\nthe attacks against Google and the other previously identified victim organizations as being typical of\ncurrent botnet criminal practices. The attack is most notable not for its advanced use of an Internet\nExplorer 6 Zero-Day exploit, but rather for its unsophisticated design and a pedigree that points to a\nfast-learning but nevertheless amateur criminal botnet team.\n\n**_DDNS Findings Summary_**\nBased upon Damballas investigation of DDNS data, the key findings are as follows:\n\n1. The botnet has a simple command topology and makes extensive use of DDNS CnC\ntechniques. The construction of the botnet would be classed as “old-school”, and is rarely used\nby professional botnet criminal operators any more. However, such reliance upon DDNS CnC is\ncommonly associated with new and amateur botnet operators\n2. There were several CnC domains were identified based upon key characteristics of the\nregistration and management of the previously publicly disclosed CnC domains.\n3. The major pattern of attacks in mid-December appear to have their origin in July 2009 in\nmainland China. This likely corresponds to early testing of the botnet CnC.\n4. Some of the infections appeared to start within Google’s network. Some of apparent botnet\nthe traffic is not consistent with an IE6/WinXP infection and cannot be easily explained.\n5. The attackers had access to large numbers of CnC hosts in geographically diverse hosting colocations – certainly a high number for a botnet. Further, the botnet used over a dozen\ndomains in diverse DDNS networks for CnC.\n6. Only the US victims were compelled to perform MX queries, an event that would typically\nindicate attempted document exfiltration via email services.\n7. Some of the botnets focused on victims outside of Google, suggesting that each domain\nmight have been dedicated to a distinct class or vertical of victims.\n8. A review of the TTL period suggests that botmasters de-registered their domains around\nDecember 18, 2009.\n\n**_Passive DNS Data Summary_**\nBased upon analysis of DNS resolution data gathered through a global network of passive DNS\nmonitoring sensors, the key findings are as follows:\n\n1. Cumulative volume of CnC domain name resolutions provides adequate sampling to identify\nthe initialization and growth phases of the Aurora botnet, which also reveals active operation\nof the CnC channels dating back to June 14th 2009.\n2. The victim’s computers connected to, or were part of, 64 different networks, based upon\nAutonomous Systems (AS) breakdown of Internet netblocks which could represent the upper\nbound of organizations that may have been breached in the larger Aurora attack. Some\norganizations (such as Google) own and manage several AS networks. Some of the other AS\nnetworks were associated with public Internet Service Providers, which may encompass\nmultiple small and medium businesses.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\n3. The various CnC domains used by the criminal botnet operators peaked at different times with\ndifferent rates of lookup by victim systems. These observations correspond to different\ncampaigns run in parallel by different botnet operators and represent the widely publicized\nattacks that appeared to make use of the Internet Explorer 6 Zero-Day exploit. It is a common\ntactic by botnet operators to run multiple campaigns at the same time, using different\ninfection vectors (e.g. drive-by downloads, FakeAV, USB infections, etc.) over extended periods\nof time. This strategy is very consistent with APT campaign methodologies.\n4. The vast majority of victim systems appear to have been based in the United States.\n5. It is possible to identify the various CnC testing, deployment, management and shutdown\nphases of the Aurora botnet CnC channels. Some of the CnC domains appear to have been\ndormant for a period of time after they had infected number victim systems. This type of\nactivity can sometimes be associated with an update to the botnet malware or if the criminal\noperator sells/trades a segment of the botnet to another criminal operator.\n\n**_Malware Analysis Summary_**\nDamballa has an array of sources for obtaining new and Zero-Day malware that range from\ncommercial security sharing programs and spam traps to samples gathered from within its enterprise\ncustomers’ networks. By automatically analyzing tens-of-thousands of new and unique samples each\nday and extracting their CnC behaviors, Damballa can cluster these malware variants with different\nbotnets. Based upon our analysis of malware samples that relied upon the Aurora CnC domains, our\nkey findings are as follows:\n\n1. The botnet operators behind the Google Aurora attacks deployed other malware families prior\nto the Trojan.Hydraq release. Some of these releases overlapped with each other.\n2. Two additional families of malware (and their evolutionary variants) were identified as “Fake AV\nAlert / Scareware – Login Software 2009” and “Fake Microsoft Antispyware Service” – both of\nwhich were deployed using fake antivirus infection messages to socially engineering the\nvictim into installing the malicious botnet agents.\n3. By tracking the evolution of the malware, Damballa was able to identify additional botnet CnC\ndomains used by the criminal operators and establish a timeline of malware associations\ngoing back to May 2nd 2009, based upon when a malware sample was captured within an\nenterprise customer network.\n4. Over the time period of this study, the botnet operators improved upon the malware they\nwere deploying. The relative sophistication and armoring of the malware families grow over\nthe months the operators were deploying it, and when they transitioned to entirely new\nmalware families.\n## 5. The major malware families associated with the Aurora botnet attacks are distinct and are\nunlikely to have been developed by the same malware engineer. This finding is typical of the\nbotnets that Damballa observes targeting enterprise networks. Relatively few botnet criminal\noperators develop and maintain their own malware. Instead, they typically rely upon thirdparty contractors or off-the-shelf malware construction kits. As such, core features and\nfunctionality changes can occur overnight, but the CnC transitions slowly as the botnet\noperator ensures that backup CnC domains remain in operation until the victim malware\nupdates (or migration) is complete.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\n Conclusions\nDamballa’s findings concerning Operation Aurora can be summarized by the following:\n\n     - At the time the attack was first noticed by Google in December 2009, systems within at least 7\ncountries had already been affected. By the time Google made the public disclosure of the attack\non January 12 2010, systems in over 22 countries had been affected and were attempting to\ncontact the CnC servers - the top five countries being the United States, China, Germany, Taiwan\nand the United Kingdom.\n\n     - The Trojan.Hydraq malware, which has been previously identified as the primary malware used by\nthe attackers, is actually a later staging of a series of malware used in the attacks which consisted\nof at least three different malware ‘families’. Two additional families of malware (and their\nevolutionary variants) have been identified, and they were deployed using fake antivirus infection\nmessages tricking the victim into installing the malicious botnet agents.\n\n     - The attacks that eventually targeted Google can be traced back to July 2009, with what appears to\nbe the first testing of the botnet by its criminal operators. The analysis identifies the various CnC\ntesting, deployment, management and shutdown phases of the botnet CnC channels.\n\n     - The botnets used dozens of domains in diverse Dynamic DNS networks for CnC. Some of the\nbotnets focused on victims outside of Google, suggesting that each set of domains might have\nbeen dedicated to a distinct class or vertical of victims.\n\n     - Some of the CnC domains appear to have been dormant for a period of time after they had\ninfected a number of victim systems. This can occur after the botnet operator has updated the\nbotnet malware with new (more powerful) variants or when the criminal operator sells/trades a\nsegment of the botnet to another criminal operator.\n\n     - There were network artifacts that suggest that the botnet malware operating with the US-based\nvictims’ networks made use of email services to extract the stolen data from the breached\norganizations.\n\n     - There is evidence that there were multiple criminal operators involved, and that the botnet\noperators were of an amateur level. The botnet has a simple command topology and makes\nextensive use of Dynamic DNS CnC techniques. The construction of the botnet would be classed\nas “old-school”, and is rarely used by professional botnet criminal operators today\n\nDamballa was able to discover these details on Operation Aurora because of a different approach to\nresearching and neutralizing botnets and other remote-controlled crimeware threats. Command-andControl – not malware or access point for the attack vector – is the essential element for a successful\nbotnet attack. Everything else about a botnet may change, but CnC must remain in place for the\nbotnet to act in any sort of cohesive manner.\n\nDamballa is the only company that monitors detailed criminal CnC activity within enterprise networks\nand uses this focus to detect and sever malicious CnC communications. As a result, Damballa has been\ncollecting CnC data for over 4 years, utilizing a globe-spanning array of network sensors within large\nenterprise customers and Internet Service Provider (ISP) customers. It is this deep visibility into\nOperation Aurora Cnc that revealed the details in this report.\n\nAlthough the methods used in Operation Aurora are amateurish and commonplace, the results were\njust as damaging as a sophisticated botnet because the threat was not quickly identified and\nneutralized. Aurora’s success proves that any breach by a botnet agent, regardless of the quality of the\nattack vector, is a dangerous security exposure. The result is always hidden and criminal remote\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\ncontrol of enterprise assets, with all of the legal, financial and reputational liabilities that accompany\nsuch a serious security lapse.\n\n## Additional Reading\n“How can I tell if I was infected by aurora”, McAfee, 2010,\n**_http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/reports/how_can_u_tell.pdf_**\n\n“Extracting CnC from Malware: The Role of Malware Sample Analysis in Botnet Detection”, Damballa, 2009,\n**_http://www.damballa.com/downloads/r_pubs/WP_Malware_Samples_Botnet_Detection.pdf_**\n\n“Serial Variant Evasion Tactics: Techniques Used to Automatically Bypass Antivirus Technologies”, Damballa,\n2009, http://www.damballa.com/downloads/r_pubs/WP_SerialVariantEvasionTactics.pdf\n\n“Botnet Communication Topologies: Understanding the intricacies of botnet Command-and-Control”,\nDamballa, 2009, **_http://www.damballa.com/downloads/r_pubs/WP_Botnet_Communications_Primer.pdf_**\n\n“The Botnet vs. Malware Relationship: The One-to-One Botnet Myth”, Damballa, 2009,\n**_http://www.damballa.com/downloads/d_pubs/WP_Botnet_vs_Malware.pdf_**\n\n“MTrends: The Advanced Persistent Threat”, Mandiant, 2010\n\n“Google china cyberattack part of vast espionage campaign, experts say”, Washington Post, 2010,\n**_http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/13/AR2010011300359.html_**\n\n“Trojan.hydraq”, Symantec, 2010, http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010**_011114-1830-99_**\n\n## Contributors\nManos Antonakakis\nChristopher Elisan\nDavid Dagon\nGunter Ollmann\nErik Wu\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Command Structure of the Aurora Botnet\n\n About Damballa, Inc.\nDamballa stops crimeware threats that exploit enterprise networks for illegal activity by finding and\ndisrupting the hidden communications channels used to control internal servers and hosts.
