Otherwise, read on for a quick breakdown of what happened, how to_**\n_detect it, and MITRE ATT&CK mappings._\n\n## Introduction\n\nWhen Splunk told me we would have a “breach holiday” theme for the summer, I didn’t think\nit would be quite so on the nose… For those of you who have been working on this Kaseya\nREvil Ransomware incident over the weekend, I salute you. We’ve been doing the same. As\nusual, my team here at Splunk likes to make sure that we have some actionable material\nbefore posting a blog, and this time is no different. In the sections below, you will see that we\n\n\n-----\n\nbreak this out into a little bit of a different format than usual. We first discuss what happened\nand what you need to know if you are actively hunting/looking for REvil ransomware via the\nKaseya VSA. We then discuss the work done by Splunk's Threat Research Team regarding\n[a deep dive on REvil, which you can read here. This deep dive will complement our](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/revil-ransomware-threat-research-update-and-detections.html)\nsignificant, existing body of content focused on helping organizations detect any and all\nstrains of ransomware. Heck, we even did a write-up talking about the Executive Order and\nmemo on ransomware from the US Federal government.\n\nFinally, we will talk about the future; what we have in store to help you train and better\nprepare for events like this before they happen again. Not to mention how to think about your\n[software supply chain. Why? Because like your alarm clock blasting “I’ve got you babe”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyBSrBqogPY)\n[every morning at 6 AM, this will happen again. Our recent “State of Security” report showed](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/campaigns/state-of-security.html)\nthat 78% of security and IT leaders fear that a SolarWinds-style attack will hit them.\nGuess what? This is one of them. As always, remember that this is a breaking news event,\nand while every effort has been made, some of our recommended searches may not be as\naccurate or performant as we desire.\n\n## What You Need to Know\n\nOn Friday afternoon, July 2nd, 2021, in what is becoming entirely too familiar a scenario,\ninternet rumors of a \"supply-chain ransomware\" attack began circulating on Reddit. As\nreports of more systems becoming encrypted surfaced, the \"rumors\" were confirmed:\nKaseya VSA, remote monitoring management (RMM) software heavily used by managed\nservice providers (MSP), was compromised by REvil, and being used to distribute\nransomware to its on-premises customers. Since VSA requires elevated permissions to\nexecute, an adversary was able to use it to disable Microsoft Defender and efficiently\ndistribute ransomware via endpoint agents. Its compromise led to a cascading effect of\nencrypted machines at the MSP customers. Eventually, organizations that don't even use\nKaseya were being infected with ransomware. As this is an ongoing incident, we'll provide\nupdates and content as we collect more data.\n\n### Worried about Today, Tomorrow, and Beyond? \n\nUnpacking this latest incident shows three significant security areas to address. We’ll be\nreleasing content to help in each of these areas, so stay tuned.\n\n**Ransomware is one of the biggest security threats to most organizations today -**\nThe [frequency and severity of ransomware attacks are increasing, as are the blogs and](https://statescoop.com/ransomware-map/)\nguidance we release to help net defenders maintain their organization's security\nposture.\n**Operational supply chain compromises and their impacts - The diversity and**\ncomplexity of interconnected services we rely on daily - a fancy way of saying if a cog\nin that technical or service wheel gets stuck (or… encrypted) - uhoh, trouble.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Your software supply chain - The Kaseya incident very much has shades of**\nPHP/SolarWinds activity, showing how destructive unauthorized modifications to\nsoftware packages can be. If you are a software developer or a user of the software, it\nhas become increasingly apparent that organizations need to have a better\nunderstanding of the processes involved in updating or developing software that they\nuse or sell.\n\nIf you are a Kaseya VSA on-prem customer, drop down to the “Detecting REvil\n**_Ransomware Kaseya in Splunk”_** section to immediately assess your environment using\nSplunk or take a peek at the wealth of content in the MITRE ATT&CK section where we pull\nevery Splunk security search we have that maps to REvil TTPs via the MITRE ATT&CK\nmethod.\n\n## Detecting REvil Ransomware Kaseya in Splunk\n\nAs many of you know, the primary challenge in detecting ransomware is the speed with\nwhich ransomware can impact systems. With a rapid response, the spread of ransomware\ncan be limited. Unfortunately, in most cases, by the time an attack is detected, files are\nalready encrypted. That said, we want to provide some insight into detections that provide\nawareness of these activities happening (as well actions one can take to mitigate the risk of\nattacks like this).\n\n\n-----\n\nWith that in mind, we are providing a set of indicators and Splunk searches to help uncover\nKaseya in your environment. If you use Enterprise Security and other Splunk products, take\na look at the “Know thy self” section below for how to scan and determine your networks\nsusceptibility to this specific attack.\n\n### Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n[Sophos and](https://community.sophos.com/b/security-blog/posts/active-ransomware-attack-on-kaseya-customers) [Cado Security have both published IOCs for Kaseya. Throw them into a Lookup](https://www.cadosecurity.com/post/resources-for-dfir-professionals-responding-to-the-revil-ransomware-kaseya-supply-chain-attack)\ntable or ES threat intel framework, and off you go! We have converted these indicators into a\n[simple CSV format to use them as lookup tables - they are posted](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.2/Knowledge/Aboutlookupsandfieldactions) [here.](https://github.com/davisshannon/Splunk-REvil-Kaseya-IOCs)\n\nAdditionally, Cado Security has published a sample packet capture (PCAP) file on their\n[Github repository covering SSL/TLS connections to some of the domains contained in the](https://github.com/cado-security/DFIR_Resources_REvil_Kaseya)\nIOC data above.\n\n### Searches\n\n[Huntress has done great work detailing activities that the ransomware code performs, and](https://www.huntress.com/blog/rapid-response-kaseya-vsa-mass-msp-ransomware-incident)\nwe will highlight some of this in our detection searches. From a Splunk detection perspective,\nhere are some data sets that we always suggest collecting:\n\n[Process execution logs from our favorite Windows Security 4688 events, or Sysmon](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/peeping-through-windows-logs.html)\nEventCode 1, or any commercial EDR, are crucial to detecting the processes involved\nin actions on intent and lateral movement, amongst other activities.\n[PowerShell Script Block Logging is also critical to detect certain modules being used](https://conf.splunk.com/files/2016/slides/powershell-power-hell-hunting-for-malicious-use-of-powershell-with-splunk.pdf)\nwhere you don’t expect and the use of encoded PowerShell.\n\nOne of its initial endpoint actions is to disable a litany of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint\ntechnologies when the ransomware runs. A litany, you say? It will disable accurate time\nmonitoring, IPS, cloud lookup, script scanning, controlled folder access, network protection,\nand stop cloud sample submissions.\n\nIt accomplishes this by issuing a PowerShell command to turn these all off, so if you are\nmonitoring PowerShell scripting, this could be a quick hit if you see all of these protections\nbeing disabled concurrently.\n\nThe detection search below requires a configuration in your inputs.conf file to monitor\nWinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational on the client where your Splunk\nUniversal Forwarder is installed.\n\nWe are only including two of the Defender technologies being turned off in the same\ncommand line for this search. A single technology being turned off could create false\npositives by authorized users, but the chances that a second technology being turned off\nsimultaneously is unlikely to be benign. Notice the wildcards in the Message field so that the\nsearch would still return results in case the order of the technologies is different. One other\n\n\n-----\n\ncomment here, keep in mind that certain values can be shortened in scripts as well. For\nexample, -drtm can be used in place of -disablerealtimemonitoring, so flexibility in searches\nis key!\n```\nsource=\"WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational\"\n| search Message=\"*Set-MpPreference -Disable* $true* -Disable* $true*\"\n| table _time, host, Message\n\n```\nIf we wanted to use the specific command found in the ransomware, we could use the\nfollowing search instead. This would have the benefit of creating an exact match but\npotentially risk missing variants that reorder the technologies in the command itself.\n```\nsource=\"WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational\"\n| search Message=\"*Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true DisableIntrusionPreventionSystem $true -DisableIOAVProtection $true DisableScriptScanning $true -EnableControlledFolderAccess Disabled EnableNetworkProtection AuditMode -Force -MAPSReporting Disabled SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSend*\"\n| table _time, host, Message \n\n```\nBut wait! I don’t have PowerShell logging set up today. Are there other options to detect this\nbehavior? Of course! Microsoft Sysmon, Event Code 1 for Process Creation, and Windows\nSecurity Event Code 4688, A new process has been created, are great to use as well.\n\nHere is what the Sysmon Event Code 1 search would look like. Depending on your\nconfiguration, the source and sourcetype might vary slightly. This same logic can be applied\nto your EDR platform of choice.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nsource WinEventLog:Microsoft Windows Sysmon/Operational EventCode 1\ncmdline=\"*powershell.exe Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true DisableIntrusionPreventionSystem $true -DisableIOAVProtection $true DisableScriptScanning $true -EnableControlledFolderAccess Disabled EnableNetworkProtection AuditMode -Force -MAPSReporting Disabled SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSend*\"\n| table _time, host\n\n```\nSimilarly, if you look at process creation in Windows Event logs, your search would look like\nthis. Depending on your configuration, the source and sourcetype might vary slightly.\n```\nsource=\"WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=4688 Process_Command_Line=\"*powershell.exe\nSet-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true -DisableIntrusionPreventionSystem\n$true -DisableIOAVProtection $true -DisableScriptScanning $true EnableControlledFolderAccess Disabled -EnableNetworkProtection AuditMode -Force MAPSReporting Disabled -SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSend*\"\n| table _time, host\n\n```\nWindows Defender status is logged to the Application folder in Windows Event Viewer. A\nsearch of the Event Code 15 and the message in the search will indicate when Defender\nreal-time monitoring has been turned off in the manner of this ransomware. Just because\nyou see these events does NOT mean you have been infected, but it does indicate that\nDefender real-time was turned off, and if the other search options above are not available to\nyou, this might be a place to start.\n```\nsource=\"WinEventLog:Application\" EventCode=15 Message=\"Updated Windows Defender\nstatus successfully to SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_SNOOZED.\"\n| table _time host Message\n\n```\nOn the outside chance that you are sending Microsoft-Windows-Windows\nDefender/Operational events to Splunk, a search like this will return events from the\nDefender application, and the details in the events will show when configurations of these\ntechnologies are changed.\n```\nsource=\"WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational\" EventCode IN\n(5001, 5004, 5007)\n| table _time host Message\n\n```\nAlong with disabling Defender, an older version (circa 2014) of msmpeng.exe (Defender) is\nbeing used to sideload REvil into the Kaseya agent software. The hash of this older\nexecutable is included in the Github IOC repository listed above.\n\nIf you have Sysmon EventCode 7, Image Loaded events, the following search could be\nhelpful to detect this side-loading of malicious DLLs as well.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nsource WinEventLog:Microsoft Windows Sysmon/Operational EventCode 7\nImage=\"*MsMpEng.exe\" ImageLoaded=\"*mpsvc.dll\" SHA256 IN\n(e2a24ab94f865caeacdf2c3ad015f31f23008ac6db8312c2cbfb32e4a5466ea2,\n8dd620d9aeb35960bb766458c8890ede987c33d239cf730f93fe49d90ae759dd)\n\n```\n[Moving into other process execution activity within the ransomware, GossiTheDog shared a](https://github.com/GossiTheDog/ThreatHunting/blob/9e3a20d7c046bd7aac765a1a7df762ac7e3acffe/AdvancedHuntingQueries/KaseyaRansomwarePayload.ahq)\nspecific process command line. Here is what that search looks like in both Sysmon and\nWindow Events, with the same caveats mentioned above.\n```\nsource=\"WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=1\ncmdline=\"c:\\\\kworking\\\\agent.exe*\"\n| table _time, host, cmdline\nsource=\"WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=4688\nProcess_Command_Line=\"c:\\\\kworking\\\\agent.exe*\"\n| table _time, host, Process_Command_Line\n\n## Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk SOAR, and Enterprise Security Content Updates (ESCU)\n\n### Know Thyself\n\n```\nWhile we have spent some time explaining this attack and effort needs to be put toward\ninvestigating this, it is also important to remember that the foundational elements of cybersecurity, such as asset management, are as crucial as ever. When performed well via your\nasset and identity framework, you can quickly identify where your vulnerable systems reside.\nRunning regular vulnerability scans that integrate into Splunk will display which systems are\nvulnerable and can help you prioritize your patching schedule and better focus your detection\nefforts. In the case of ransomware, knowing which assets to protect or are impacted as\nquickly as possible can be key to your defense strategy.\n\n[While the details of the vulnerability in the Kaseya software have not been detailed, it](https://therecord.media/kaseya-zero-day-involved-in-ransomware-attack-patches-coming/)\nappears that the [CVE-2021-30116 will be utilized, and as vulnerability assessment solutions](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30116)\nupdate their platforms, searching for this vulnerability will be essential to understand future\nexposure to this attack vector.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Threat Intelligence Framework\n\n[If you are using Splunk Enterprise Security, the lookups of IOCs listed above can be](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/enterprise-security.html)\ningested easily into the threat intelligence framework. Perhaps you aren’t sure how to do\nthat. No worries, we published some guidance and a how-to on integrating lists of IOCs into\nthe Enterprise Security threat intelligence framework.\n\n### Enterprise Security Content Updates (ESCU)\n\nIf you have ESCU running today, you already have some great coverage!

my back, I told [James Brodsky that he should “create a TA](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/author/jbrodsky.html)\nthat detects files being encrypted.” Of course, he took me seriously and went off and created\n[“TA-rcanary.” This TA uses fschange, a deprecated feature of the Splunk UF (which still](https://github.com/stressboi/TA-rcanary)\nworks), to monitor a single randomly named .docx file in a hidden directory on the Windows\nfilesystem. Upon the first run, the .docx file is created in this directory. Then, a fschange entry\nis added to the inputs.conf, and every 15 seconds, this file is monitored for any changes. If\nany changes occur to it (copy of it, delete it, rename it, etc.), an event is generated and\nindexed in Splunk, as shown below. Keep in mind that this is a very new TA and will probably\nneed some changes, but if it helps, you have “Splunkspiration” and detects some encrypted\nfiles… all the better!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe know that many of you are coming to this blog not because you were impacted directly\nby the Kaseya ransomware incident but because you are worried that you might be affected\nin the future. Hopefully, the content above will provide you with searches that give you the\nability to have more visibility into your environment and detect (and we hope it never does) a\nransomware outbreak in your network. If they don’t work perfectly, think of them as\n“SplunkSpiration” :-).\n\n\n-----\n\nWe will update this blog and add new content as needed over the next week, but keep your\neyes peeled for the upcoming publication on REvil ransomware by the Splunk Threat\nResearch team. Furthermore, Splunk will be developing significantly more content this month\naround ransomware. Workshops, webinars, Twitter Spaces, and much more, so watch out\nfor those coming soon.\n\nFinally, even though this blog primarily focused on ransomware, the more significant concern\nis that this attack appears to be propagated via the software supply chain of the victims. We\nrecognize what a big deal this is and have dedicated sessions at October’s .conf21 around\nthis very topic. If you are new to Supply Chain attacks and want to learn how to defend your\norg against things like SolarWinds or Kaseya, consider attending my talk with Marcus\nLaFerrerra, “Hunting the known unknown: Supply Chain Attacks” (SEC-1745). If you are a\ndefender whose company builds software, I’d suggest attending “Securing the software\nfactory with Splunk” (SEC-1108) by Dave Herrald and Chris Riley. No matter what you do, I\nhope that you could get some enjoyment this weekend and weren’t chained to the desk like\nwe were. As always, happy hunting :-)\n\nAnd one more thing: As we’ve stated before, this blog ain’t the first time we’re covering our\napproach to Ransomware:\n\n**.conf talks and videos**\n\n[Splunking the Endpoint 2016: Ransomware Edition! and](https://conf.splunk.com/files/2016/slides/splunking-the-endpoint-hands-on.pdf) [Video](https://conf.splunk.com/files/2016/recordings/splunking-the-endpoint-hands-on.mp4)\n[How Splunk Can Help You Prevent Ransomware From Holding Your Business Hostage](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/how-splunk-can-help-you-prevent-ransomware-from-holding-your-business-hostage.html)\nWindows Ransomware Detection with Splunk (1 of 6) – Vulnerability Detection and\nWindows Patch Status\n\n**Detections Blogs**\n\n**Whitepaper**\n\n[Splunk Security: Detecting Unknown Malware and Ransomware](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/form/detecting-unknown-malware.html)\n\n**Splunk SOAR Responses**\n\n**Machine Learning Method**\n\n[Detect Ransomware in Your Data with the Machine Learning Cloud Service](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/detect-ransomware-in-your-data-with-the-machine-learning-cloud-service.html)\n\n**Operationalizing Detections**\n\n[Operationalize Ransomware Detections Quickly and Easily with Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/industries/operationalize-ransomware-detections-quickly-and-easily-with-splunk.html)\n\n## Bibliography/Reading list\n\n\n-----\n\nBeaumont, Kevin.
