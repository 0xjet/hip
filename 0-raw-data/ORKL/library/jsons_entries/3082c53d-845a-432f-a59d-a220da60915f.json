On the same\nday, a US judge approved a seizure warrant that allowed federal authorities in Los Angeles\nto seize the internet domain, and Swiss law enforcement seized the server hosting the\nNetWire RAT infrastructure.\n\nThe malware, [first discovered in 2012, is often hidden in malicious files. The RAT is a](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0198/)\nfavourite of cyber crime gangs and state-backed groups, and is frequently delivered by\nphishing attacks. After infecting a victim's smartphone or laptop, the RAT's capabilities\ninclude stealing passwords, keylogging, and remotely controlling the device.\n\n\"By removing the NetWire RAT, the FBI has impacted the criminal cyber ecosystem,\" Donald\nAlway, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, declared in a\n[statement.](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/federal-authorities-seize-internet-domain-selling-malware-used-illegally-control-and)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe global partnership that led to the arrest in Croatia also removed a popular tool used to\nhijack computers in order to perpetuate global fraud, data breaches and network intrusions\nby threat groups and cyber criminals,\" Alway added.\n\nThe FBI's Los Angeles bureau opened an investigation into the malware distributor in 2020.\nAs part of this, undercover agents created accounts on the website, paid for a subscription,\nand \"constructed a customized instance of the NetWire RAT using the product's Builder\nTool,\" according to the affidavit in support of the seizure warrant.\n\n[As described in a warrant [PDF], Verisign redirected the worldwiredlabs domain to servers](https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/03/09/netwire_domain_seizure_warrant.pdf)\ncontrolled by the FBI.\n\nNeither US nor Croatian authorities released the suspect's name. However infosec journalist\n[Brian Krebs has identified Mario Zanko of Zapresic, Croatia, as the owner of the domain](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/03/whos-behind-the-netwire-remote-access-trojan/)\nsince 2012.\n\nThe malware peddler allegedly sold NetWire licenses for between $10 and $1,200, according\nto [Croatian police, who have yet to determine the total illicit haul from selling the RAT.](https://www-index-hr.translate.goog/vijesti/clanak/kod-zagreba-uhicen-haker-hrvatskoj-policiji-u-istrazi-pomogao-fbi/2445145.aspx?index_tid=328489&index_ref=naslovnica_vijesti_ostalo_d&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)\n\nOther criminals who bought the malware used NetWire to target healthcare organizations\nand banks, they added.\n\nThe NetWire takedown follows several other international law enforcement operations over\nrecent months intended to disrupt high-profile cyber crime gangs.\n\nEarlier this month German and Ukrainian cops, working with Europol and the FBI, arrested\n[suspected members of the DoppelPaymer ransomware crew and issued warrants for three](https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/06/doppelpaymer_ransomware_arrests/)\nother \"masterminds\" behind the global operation.\n\n[In January, US and international law enforcement partners shut down Hive's ransomware](https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/26/fbi_hive_ransomware/)\ninfrastructure following a seven-month covert operation. During that time, the FBI hacked\nHive's network and used that access to provide decryption keys to more than 300 victims –\nsaving them $130 million in ransomware payments, we're told.\n\n[That same month European cops arrested 15 suspected scammers and shut down a multi-](https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/13/europol_crypto_investment_arrests/)\ncountry network of call centers selling fake cryptocurrency that law enforcement alleged stole\nupwards of hundreds of million euros from victims. ®\n\n**Similar topics**\n\n[Cybercrime](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Cybercrime/)\n[FBI](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/FBI/)\n[Security](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Security/)\n\n×\n\n\n-----\n\n## Similar topics\n\n[Cybercrime](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Cybercrime/)\n[FBI](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/FBI/)\n[Security](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Security/)\n\n## Narrower topics\n\n Broader topics\n\n[United States Department of Justice](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice/)\n\n**Similar topics**\n\n**4** [COMMENTS](https://forums.theregister.com/forum/all/2023/03/10/fbi_netwire_seizure/)\n\n**Similar topics**\n\n[Cybercrime](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Cybercrime/)\n[FBI](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/FBI/)\n[Security](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Security/)\n\n×\n\n## Similar topics\n\n[Cybercrime](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Cybercrime/)\n[FBI](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/FBI/)\n[Security](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Security/)\n\n## Narrower topics\n\n[2FA](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/2FA/)\n[Advanced persistent threat](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Advanced%20persistent%20threat/)\n[Application Delivery Controller](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Application%20Delivery%20Controller/)\n[Authentication](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Authentication/)\n[BEC](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/BEC/)\n[Black Hat](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Black%20Hat/)\n[Bug Bounty](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Bug%20Bounty/)\n[Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Common%20Vulnerability%20Scoring%20System/)\n[Cybersecurity](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Cybersecurity/)\n[Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Cybersecurity%20and%20Infrastructure%20Security%20Agency/)\n[Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Cybersecurity%20Information%20Sharing%20Act/)\n[Data Breach](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Data%20Breach/)\n[Data Protection](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Data%20Protection/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Data Theft](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Data%20Theft/)\n[DDoS](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/DDoS/)\n[Digital certificate](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Digital%20certificate/)\n[Encryption](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Encryption/)\n[Exploit](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Exploit/)\n[Firewall](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Firewall/)\n[Hacker](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Hacker/)\n[Hacking](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Hacking/)\n[Identity Theft](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Identity%20Theft/)\n[Incident response](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Incident%20response/)\n[Infosec](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Infosec/)\n[Kenna Security](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Kenna%20Security/)\n[NCSAM](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/NCSAM/)\n[NCSC](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/NCSC/)\n[Palo Alto Networks](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Palo%20Alto%20Networks/)\n[Password](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Password/)\n[Phishing](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Phishing/)\n[Quantum key distribution](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Quantum%20key%20distribution/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Ransomware/)\n[Remote Access Trojan](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Remote%20Access%20Trojan/)\n[REvil](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/REvil/)\n[RSA Conference](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/RSA%20Conference/)\n[Spamming](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Spamming/)\n[Spyware](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Spyware/)\n[Surveillance](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Surveillance/)\n[TLS](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/TLS/)\n[Trojan](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Trojan/)\n[Trusted Platform Module](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Trusted%20Platform%20Module/)\n[Vulnerability](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Vulnerability/)\n[Wannacry](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Wannacry/)\n[Zero trust](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Zero%20trust/)\n\n## Broader topics\n\n[United States Department of Justice](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice/)\n\n**TIP US OFF**\n\n[Send us news](https://www.theregister.com/Profile/contact/)\n\n\n-----",
