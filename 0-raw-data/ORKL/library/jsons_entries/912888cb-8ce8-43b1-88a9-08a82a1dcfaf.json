He previously\nposted a batch of 16 databases containing the data of 620 million users and a second batch of eight databases with the data of 127 million\nusers.\n\nToday, the hacker published eight more hacked DBs containing data for 92.76 million users. The biggest name in today's batch is GfyCat, the\nfamous GIF hosting and sharing platform. The hacker is selling each database individually on Dream Market. Together, all eight are worth\n2.6249 bitcoin, which amounts to roughly $9,400.\n\nIn an interview with ZDNet on Friday, Gnosticplayers took credit for the hacks and denied being just an intermediary.\n\nThe hacker says he intends to sell over one billion user records and then disappear with the money. His current total stands at roughly 840\nmillion records.\n\n\"My two main goals are: -money -downfall of American pigs,\" he told us.\n\nNew leaks are coming, including one from a cryptocurrency exchange, the hacker told ZDNet.\n\nThe eight companies whose data Gnosticplayers put up for sale today are listed below:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Breach**\n**date** **Price** **Content**\n\n\n**Company**\n\nLegendas.tv (movie\nsharing service)\n\nJobandtalent (job\nportal)\n\nOnebip (mobile\npayment platform)\n\nStoryBird (storytelling\nservice)\n\nStreetEasy (real\nestate)\n\nGfyCat (GIF image\nhosting)\n\nClassPass (fitness\nservice)\n\nPizap (online photo\neditor)\n\n\n**DB**\n**size**\n\n3.86\nMil\n\n11\nMil\n\n2.6\nMil\n\n4\nMil\n\n1\nMil\n\n8\nMil\n\n1.5\nMil\n\n60.8\nMil\n\n\n2017/10\n\n2018/02\n\n2017/10\n\n2015\n\n2018/05\n\n2018\n\n2018\n\n2018\n\n\n\n[฿][0.35]\n\n[฿][0.4669]\n\n[฿][0.2626]\n\n฿0.2334\n\n[฿][0.175]\n\n฿0.35\n\n฿0.204\n\n฿0.583\n\n\nusername, password (cleartext), email, IP address\n\nid, email, SHA1 encrypted password, password salt, first name, surname, current IP\naddress\n\nuser ID, name, email, password (cleartext), address, company info, phone number,\nPayPal info, banking info, login logs, API key, and other\n\nemail, password (SHA256), username, other\n\nusername, email, password hash (SHA1) and salt, other\n\nusername, password hash (SHA512), email, other\n\nemail, password hash (SHA1), username, country, sex, full name\n\nFacebook user ID, password hash (SHA1 / not for all), email address, other\n\n\n-----\n\nGnosticplayers round 3\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\nNone of the eight companies listed in Gnosticplayers' ad had previously disclosed a data breach. ZDNet has sent requests for comment to the\neight companies. We will update the article with any information we get back. However, many of the companies whose data the hacker has put\nup for sale in the past week have already admitted to suffering security breaches, making very likely that the data he's selling today is also\nlegitimate.\n\nIn addition, each listing was also accompanied with the following message:\n\nGeorge Duke-Cohan is a young and talented boy, instead of giving him a chance, the UK govt sends him to prison for three years.\nNow, he's been told by the American government, that he faces 65 years for the offense he was already sentenced to three years in the\nUK. It means he will be judged twice ??\nMay this upcoming release of dumps serve as a reminder:\nWhen countries claim to respect their citizens, they have duty protect them. I wouldn't be surprised whether George Duke-Cohan ends\nhis life, the UK gov already destroyed him and doing this is like sentencing him to death.\nIf he is not given a fair justice during the upcoming days weeks years more data will be released\n\n\n-----\n\nGeo ge u e Co a s a U at o a o s pa t og t e [pop s Squad](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-arrests-second-apophis-squad-hacker-in-the-us/) ac g c e e [as a ested ast su](http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/1460-british-teen-admits-school-and-flight-bomb-threats) e a d se te ced to t ee\n[years in prison last December.](http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/1515-british-teen-jailed-after-admitting-school-and-flight-bomb-threats)\n\n**UPDATE: GfyCat told ZDNet that they have started an investigation into the hacker's claims.**\n\n\"We can also confirm that any account databases are strongly encrypted and salted, so no plain text passwords would be in any compromised\ndata,\" a spokesperson told us via email today.\n\nA ClassPass spokesperson also told us they've launched an investigation. OneBip also started an investigation, and provided the following\nstatement.\n\n\"Please rest assured that between 10/2017 and today there have been several improvements made on the security side independently from\nthis claimed data breach. We have already informed our customers about this, and precautionary measures have already been initiated,\"\nOneBip said.\n\n**Data leaks: The most common sources**\n\n## More data breach coverage:\n\n\n-----",
