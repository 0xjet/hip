I live in Brazil. :D\n\n#All components used are native to Delphi itself.\n\n**There are some observations to be taken before opening the project:**\n\nYou should install the Delphi XE, the DCLSockets component. Simply open the Delphi\nXE, click \"Component\" -> \"Install Packages\". Now click \"Add\", now go in the \"Bin\"\nfolder in the installation of Delphi XE (Example: C:\\Program Files\n(x86)\\Embarcadero\\Studio\\14.0\\bin) and open the \"dclsocketsXXX.bpl\" file. The XXX\nare numbers according to your version of Delphi.\n\n\n-----\n\nIndy10 was presenting MANY problems during the development, so I had to make\nsome decisions to complete the project. For the correct operation of the software, we\nhad to use Delphi to write XE6 Client and Delphi 7 to write the Server. Then, the client\nmust be opened in Delphi XE and the Server in Delphi 7.\nThe software requires a central server, I recommend host it on a server inside your\ncountry, so there is a low latency.\nLike any BETA project, this is subject to bugs that will be corrected over time. I count\non the cooperation of all.\nIf they can solve any problem, just send the solution that it will be posted.\nThe function of the server is to route all data traffic, delivering each packet to the\ncorrect user. The server forwards the packets as soon as they are received to gain\nperformance.\nOn the Client project, the unit has two Form_Main constant calls \"Host\" and \"Port\". In\nthe constant \"Host\" you must enter the DNS or IP address of your server. In the\nconstant \"Port\" you should enter the port that was chosen in the constant of the\n\"Server\".\n\n**AllaKore Remote has the following functions:**\n\nConnection ID and Password.\nRemote access with RFB algorithm (Send only what has changed on the screen).\nData Compression (zLib).\nSharer files.\nChat.\n\n\n-----",
