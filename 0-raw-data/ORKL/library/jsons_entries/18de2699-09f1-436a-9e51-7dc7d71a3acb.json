The uncompressed archive contains 37GB of source code allegedly\nbelonging to hundreds of Microsoft projects, including for Bing, Cortana, and Bing Maps.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft has now confirmed that the attackers have compromised the account of one of its\nemployees gaining limited access to source code repositories. The company pointed out that\ncustomer code or data was not compromised as a result of unauthorized access.\n\n_“This week, the actor made public claims that they had gained access to Microsoft and_\n_exfiltrated portions of source code. No customer code or data was involved in the observed_\n_activities. Our investigation has found a single account had been compromised, granting_\n_limited access. Our cybersecurity response teams quickly engaged to remediate the_\n\n\n-----\n\n_compromised account and prevent further activity. reads the_ _[post published by Microsoft.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction/)_\n_“Microsoft does not rely on the secrecy of code as a security measure and viewing source_\n_code does not lead to elevation of risk.”_\n\nMicrosoft team launched an investigation immediately after the Lapsus$ gang, tracked by the\ncompany as DEV-0537, claimed to have hacked the company.\n\nMicrosoft’s post detailed the Lapsus gang’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs),\nbelow are some of the methods that they used to compromise user identities to gain initial\naccess to an organization:\n\n[Deploying the malicious Redline password stealer to obtain passwords and session](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/126627/cyber-crime/redline-malware-omicron.html)\ntokens\nPurchasing credentials and session tokens from criminal underground forums\nPaying employees at targeted organizations (or suppliers/business partners) for access\nto credentials and MFA approval\nSearching public code repositories for exposed credentials\n\nThe threat actors used the compromised credentials and/or session tokens to access the\ntarget networks through internet-facing systems and applications (i.e. virtual private network\n(VPN), remote desktop protocol (RDP), virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) including Citrix, or\nIdentity providers (including Azure Active Directory, Okta)).\n\nThe gang also uses session replay attacks to compromise the accounts that are protected\nwith MFA, in some cases, they also continuously trigger MFA notifications until the user\n[allowed them to log in. In at least one attack, the group also used a SIM swap attack to](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/127880/cyber-crime/sim-swapping-gang-dismantled.html)\nbypass 2FA.\n\n_“Once DEV-0537 obtained access to the target network using the compromised account,_\n_they used multiple tactics to discover additional credentials or intrusion points to extend their_\n_access including:_\n\n_Exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities on internally accessible servers including JIRA,_\n_Gitlab, and Confluence_\n_Searching code repositories and collaboration platforms for exposed credentials and_\n_secrets._\n\n_They have been consistently observed to use AD Explorer, a publicly available tool, to_\n_enumerate all users and groups in the said network.” continues the analysis._\n\nLapsus$ gang set up a dedicated infrastructure in known virtual private server (VPS)\nproviders and leverages NordVPN for data exfiltration using VPN egress points that were\ngeographically like their targets to avoid detection. Data stolen from the targeted organization\nwere also used for future extortion or public release.\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft provides the following recommendations to protect against threat actors:\n\nStrengthen MFA implementation\nRequire Healthy and Trusted Endpoints\nLeverage modern authentication options for VPNs\nStrengthen and monitor your cloud security posture\nImprove awareness of social engineering attacks\nEstablish operational security processes in response to DEV-0537 intrusions\n\nOver the last months, the Lapsus$ gang compromised other prominent companies such\nas [NVIDIA,](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/128573/data-breach/nvidia-data-breach.html) [Samsung,](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/128828/data-breach/samsung-data-breach.html) [Ubisoft, Mercado Libre, and Vodafone.](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/128929/hacking/ubisoft-cyber-security-incident.html)\n\nOn Thursday, March 10, the group announced they’re starting to recruit insiders employed\nwithin major technology giants and ISPs, such companies include Microsoft, Apple, EA\nGames and IBM. Their scope of interests includes – major telecommunications companies\nsuch as Claro, Telefonica and AT&T.\n\nNotably, the actors are looking to buy remote VPN access and asking potential insiders to\ncontact them privately via Telegram, they then reward them by paying for the access\ngranted.\n\n**[Pierluigi Paganini](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559)**\n\n**[(SecurityAffairs –](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)** **hacking, Microsoft)**\n\nYou might also like\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Experts believe that Russian Gamaredon APT could fuel a new round of DDoS attacks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131762/apt/gamaredon-apt-ddos-attacks.html)**\n\nMay 28, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\n**[The strange link between Industrial Spy and the Cuba ransomware operation](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131754/cyber-crime/industrial-spy-cuba-ransomware.html)**\n\nMay 28, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\nCopyright 2021 Security Affairs by Pierluigi Paganini All Right Reserved.\nBack to top\n\n[Home](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)\n[Cyber Crime](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-crime)\n[Cyber warfare](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-warfare-2)\n[APT](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/apt)\n[Data Breach](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/data-breach)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Deep Web](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/deep-web)\n[Digital ID](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/digital-id)\n[Hacking](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacking)\n[Hacktivism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacktivism)\n[Intelligence](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/intelligence)\n[Internet of Things](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/iot)\n[Laws and regulations](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/laws-and-regulations)\n[Malware](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/malware)\n[Mobile](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/mobile-2)\n[Reports](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/reports)\n[Security](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/security)\n[Social Networks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/social-networks)\n[Terrorism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/terrorism)\n[ICS-SCADA](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/ics-scada)\n[EXTENDED COOKIE POLICY](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/extended-cookie-policy)\n[Contact me](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/contact)\n\n\n-----",
