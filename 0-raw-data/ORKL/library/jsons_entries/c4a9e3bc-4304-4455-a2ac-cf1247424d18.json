Customers now access a payment\nsystem over TOR(socks5v7v2snlwr7[.]onion) which presents a screen for building builds, the\namount of builds you can buy along with the price has changed over time with the current\noption of buying involving 10 or 100 rebuilds.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter selecting which package you want you are given a screen with a timer and a wallet to\nsend the payment to.\n\nAfter building you get a compressed archive containing your bot, server and PHP\ncomponent:\n```\nName-----------------------install.txtdllwwwwww/systembcwww/systembc/geoipserver.exeserver.outsocks.exedll/socks3\nCity.mmdb-----------------------\n```\nThe server that actors buy the package from actually contains the builder and database\nwhich is a collective of build IDs associated with each actors purchase and build. The stubs\nneeded for building are also present. This method of building is also commonly used for\ncrypters where you create a stub which is an already compiled executable file designed to\nhave certain pieces of it overwritten by using either tag based identifiers or offsets in the\nbinary. In this case it overwrites the needed configuration data in the stub files by finding the\n‘BEGIN DATA’ marker and then packages them all up into a compressed archive for delivery\nto the buyer.\n```\nBEGINDATAHOST1:192.168.1.149HOST2:192.168.1.149PORT1:4001TOR:\n\n```\nThe server just needs which ports to listen on for communicating with the PHP panel as well\nas with the incoming bots.\n```\nPORT0:4000PORT1:4001\n\n```\nHiding behind TOR is becoming an increasingly common tactic for CyberCrime actors but it\ndoes not make them invulnerable to being found, in this case the server after TOR is\n107.175.150[.]179. From there we can recover most of the information needed for tracking\nthe actor selling the malware and their customers, including the stub files for building:\n```\nsocks-null.exeserver-null.out\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nAlong with the database of customers and their builds which makes finding the actors and\ntheir panels relatively easy. Using the current pricing structure against the database we can\nestimate that the actor has made over ~100k USD from just selling malware builds via this\nserver with just the current listing in the database. We also discovered that some of the\nactors clients are high profile criminals in the CyberCrime domain.\n\nHistorically proxy bots such as SystemBC have not been tracked as closely, as it hasn’t\nthought to be leveraged in large scale attacks, but we discovered some of the clients panels\ncontained a significant number of bots. Some of the groups this actor is selling to include\nTrickBot, QBot and IcedID.\n\nIn conjunction with the discovery of the large panels we also discovered that some of the\npanels the bots were being tasked with downloading CobaltStrike, for example one panel\nwas pushing the following tasks:\n```\nhxxp://172.104.63[.]157/crypt_beacon.exe hxxp://172.104.63[.]157/crypt_artifact.exe\n\n```\nBeing leveraged by some large CyberCrime groups as more of a backdoor for delivering\nCobaltStrike makes SystemBC one more thing to look out for being installed in your\nenvironment and potentially left behind even after cleaning up the other related infections.\n\n## IOCs\n```\nbackupboxsite.cominfodialsxbz.comdata.servicestatus.one185.61.138.59s.avluboy.xyzfmk7k\narchiver.ru3q5d4sgdxdxkkzhl.oniontvtmhltd.org23.249.163.103vpnstart.chickenkiller.comh\ntak.clubbc.fgget.top185.254.121.121scserv2.infofahrrados.de45.145.65.32prorequestops.c\ntak-superpuper.xyzusmostik.comt6xhk2j3iychxc2n.onion91.241.19.10176.123.8.22645.146.165.247217.\nlab.com185.119.57.12631.44.184.186you.bitxxxxxxtnuhffpbep.onion217.8.117.65cashnetserver.com4renewdmn.biz137.74.151.4235.246.186.8684.38.129.162ssl.virtualpoolnet.comwe\nnetworking.comjlayxnzzin5y335h.onion103.124.104.11qtrader.club185.125.230.131protoukt.\nsocks.cc23hfdne.comamericalatina.clubjjj.rop.dev45.77.65.7145.77.65.72149.28.201.253ef\nlink.networkdl-link.club88.198.147.8078.47.64.46\n\n References\n\n```\n1:https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/systembc-christmas-july-socks5malware-and-exploit-kits\n\n[2:https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/14/inside-a-new-ryuk-ransomware-attack/](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/14/inside-a-new-ryuk-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[3:https://twitter.com/vk_intel/status/1234891766924484609?lang=en](https://twitter.com/vk_intel/status/1234891766924484609?lang=en)\n\n\n-----",
