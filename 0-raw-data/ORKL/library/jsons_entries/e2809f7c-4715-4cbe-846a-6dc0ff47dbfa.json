    "plain_text": "**December 07, 2017 | by Manish Sardiwal, Yogesh Londhe, Nalani Fraser, Nicholos Richard, Jaqueline**\n**O’Leary, Vincent Cannon | Threat Research**\n\n**Less than a week after Microsoft issued a patch for** **[CVE-2017-11882 on Nov. 14, 2017, FireEye observed an](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11882)**\n\n**attacker using an exploit for the Microsoft Office vulnerability to target a government organization in the**\n\n**Middle East. We assess this activity was carried out by a suspected Iranian cyber espionage threat group,**\n\n**whom we refer to as APT34, using a custom PowerShell backdoor to achieve its objectives.**\n\n**We believe APT34 is involved in a long-term cyber espionage operation largely focused on reconnaissance**\n\n**efforts to benefit Iranian nation-state interests and has been operational since at least 2014. This threat group**\n\n**has conducted broad targeting across a variety of industries, including financial, government, energy,**\n\n**chemical, and telecommunications, and has largely focused its operations within the Middle East. We assess**\n\n**that APT34 works on behalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references**\n\n**to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests. The full report on**\n\n**[APT34 is available to our MySIGHT customer community.](https://www.fireeye.com/products/isight-cyber-threat-intelligence-subscriptions.html)**\n\n**APT34 uses a mix of public and non-public tools, often conducting spear phishing operations using**\n\n**compromised accounts, sometimes coupled with social engineering tactics. In May 2016, we published a blog**\n\n**[detailing a spear phishing campaign targeting banks in the Middle East region that used macro-enabled](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.html)**\n\n**attachments to distribute POWBAT malware. We now attribute that campaign to APT34. In July 2017, we**\n\n**observed APT34 targeting a Middle East organization using a PowerShell-based backdoor that we call**\n**POWRUNER and a downloader with domain generation algorithm functionality that we call BONDUPDATER,**\n**based on strings within the malware. The backdoor was delivered via a malicious .rtf file that exploited CVE-**\n**2017-0199.**\n\n**In this latest campaign, APT34 leveraged the recent Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 to deploy**\n**POWRUNER and BONDUPDATER.**\n\n**CVE-2017-11882 affects several versions of Microsoft Office and, when exploited, allows a remote user to run**\n**arbitrary code in the context of the current user as a result of improperly handling objects in memory. The**\n**vulnerability was patched by Microsoft on Nov. 14, 2017. A full proof of concept (POC) was publicly released**\n**a week later by the reporter of the vulnerability.**\n\n**The vulnerability exists in the old Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE), a component of Microsoft Office that is**\n**used to insert and evaluate mathematical formulas. The Equation Editor is embedded in Office documents**\n**using object linking and embedding (OLE) technology. It is created as a separate process instead of child**\n\n**process of Office applications. If a crafted formula is passed to the Equation Editor, it does not check the data**\n\n\n-----\n\n**technique that guards against the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities, the attacker can easily**\n**alter the flow of program execution.**\n\n**APT34 sent a malicious .rtf file (MD5: a0e6933f4e0497269620f44a083b2ed4) as an attachment in a**\n**malicious spear phishing email sent to the victim organization. The malicious file exploits CVE-2017-11882,**\n**which corrupts the memory on the stack and then proceeds to push the malicious data to the stack. The**\n**malware then overwrites the function address with the address of an existing instruction from**\n\n**EQNEDT32.EXE. The overwritten instruction (displayed in Figure 1) is used to call the “WinExec” function**\n**from kernel32.dll, as depicted in the instruction at 00430c12, which calls the “WinExec” function.**\n\n**Figure 1: Disassembly of overwritten function address**\n\n**After exploitation, the ‘WinExec’ function is successfully called to create a child process, “mshta.exe”, in the**\n\n**context of current logged on user. The process “mshta.exe” downloads a malicious script from hxxp://mumbai-**\n**m[.]site/b.txt and executes it, as seen in Figure 2.**\n\n**Figure 2: Attacker data copied to corrupt stack buffer**\n\n**The malicious script goes through a series of steps to successfully execute and ultimately establish a**\n\n**connection to the command and control (C2) server. The full sequence of events starting with the exploit**\n\n**document is illustrated in Figure 3.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3: CVE-2017-11882 and POWRUNER attack sequence**\n\n**1. The malicious .rtf file exploits CVE-2017-11882.**\n**2. The malware overwrites the function address with an existing instruction from EQNEDT32.EXE.**\n**3. The malware creates a child process, “mshta.exe,” which downloads a file from: hxxp://mumbai-**\n\n**m[.]site/b.txt.**\n**4. b.txt contains a PowerShell command to download a dropper from: hxxp://dns-update[.]club/v.txt. The**\n\n**PowerShell command also renames the downloaded file from v.txt to v.vbs and executes the script.**\n**5. The v.vbs script drops four components (hUpdateCheckers.base, dUpdateCheckers.base,**\n\n**cUpdateCheckers.bat, and GoogleUpdateschecker.vbs) to the directory:**\n**C:\\ProgramData\\Windows\\Microsoft\\java\\**\n**6. v.vbs uses CertUtil.exe, a legitimate Microsoft command-line program installed as part of Certificate**\n\n**Services, to decode the base64-encoded files hUpdateCheckers.base and dUpdateCheckers.base, and**\n**drop hUpdateCheckers.ps1 and dUpdateCheckers.ps1 to the staging directory.**\n**7. cUpdateCheckers.bat is launched and creates a scheduled task for GoogleUpdateschecker.vbs**\n\n**persistence.**\n\n**8. GoogleUpdateschecker.vbs is executed after sleeping for five seconds.**\n**9. cUpdateCheckers.bat and *.base are deleted from the staging directory.**\n\n**Figure 4 contains an excerpt of the v.vbs script pertaining to the Execution Workflow section.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: Execution Workflow Section of v.vbs**\n\n**After successful execution of the steps mentioned in the Execution Workflow section, the Task Scheduler will**\n\n**launch GoogleUpdateschecker.vbs every minute, which in turn executes the dUpdateCheckers.ps1 and**\n**hUpdateCheckers.ps1 scripts. These PowerShell scripts are final stage payloads – they include a downloader**\n**with domain generation algorithm (DGA) functionality and the backdoor component, which connect to the C2**\n\n**server to receive commands and perform additional malicious activities.**\n\n**The backdoor component, POWRUNER, is a PowerShell script that sends and receives commands to and**\n\n**from the C2 server. POWRUNER is executed every minute by the Task Scheduler. Figure 5 contains an**\n**excerpt of the POWRUNER backdoor.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5: POWRUNER PowerShell script hUpdateCheckers.ps1**\n\n**POWRUNER begins by sending a random GET request to the C2 server and waits for a response. The**\n**server will respond with either “not_now” or a random 11-digit number. If the response is a random number,**\n\n**POWRUNER will send another random GET request to the server and store the response in a string.**\n**POWRUNER will then check the last digit of the stored random number response, interpret the value as a**\n**command, and perform an action based on that command. The command values and the associated actions**\n\n**are described in Table 1.**\n\n|Command|Description|Action|\n|---|---|---|\n|0|Server response string contains batch commands|Execute batch commands and send results back to server|\n|1|Server response string is a file path|Check for file path and upload (PUT) the file to server|\n\n\n-----\n\n**is a file path** **download (GET) the file**\n\n**Table 1: POWRUNER commands**\n\n**After successfully executing the command, POWRUNER sends the results back to the C2 server and stops**\n\n**execution.**\n\n**The C2 server can also send a PowerShell command to capture and store a screenshot of a victim’s system.**\n**POWRUNER will send the captured screenshot image file to the C2 server if the “fileupload” command is**\n\n**issued. Figure 6 shows the PowerShell “Get-Screenshot” function sent by the C2 server.**\n\n**Figure 6: Powershell Screenshot Functionality**\n\n**One of the recent advancements by APT34 is the use of DGA to generate subdomains. The BONDUPDATER**\n**script, which was named based on the hard-coded string “B007”, uses a custom DGA algorithm to generate**\n**subdomains for communication with the C2 server.**\n\n**Figure 7 provides a breakdown of how an example domain (456341921300006B0C8B2CE9C9B007.mumbai-**\n**m[.]site) is generated using BONDUPDATER’s custom DGA.**\n\n**Figure 7: Breakdown of subdomain created by BONDUPDATER**\n\n**1. This is a randomly generated number created using the following expression: $rnd = -join (Get-Random -**\n\n**InputObject (10..99) -Count (%{ Get-Random -InputObject (1..6)}));**\n**2. This value is either 0 or 1. It is initially set to 0. If the first resolved domain IP address starts with**\n\n**24.125.X.X, then it is set to 1.**\n**3. Initially set to 000, then incremented by 3 after every DNS request**\n\n**4.

Create a temporary file in %temp% location**\n\n**The file created will have the last two octets of the resolved IP addresses as its filename.**\n\n**2. BONDUPDATER will evaluate the last character of the file name and perform the corresponding action**\n\n**found in Table 2.**\n\n**Character** **Description**\n\n**File contains batch**\n\n**0** **commands, it executes**\n\n**the batch commands**\n\n**Rename the temporary**\n**1**\n\n**file as .ps1 extension**\n\n**Rename the temporary**\n**2**\n**file as .vbs extension**\n\n**Table 2: BONDUPDATER Actions**\n\n**Figure 8 is a screenshot of BONDUPDATER’s DGA implementation.**\n\n**Figure 8: Domain Generation Algorithm**\n\n**Some examples of the generated subdomains observed at time of execution include:**\n\n**143610035BAF04425847B007.mumbai-m[.]site**\n\n**835710065BAF04425847B007.mumbai-m[.]site**\n\n**376110095BAF04425847B007.mumbai-m[.]site**\n\n**Figure 9 shows example network communications between a POWRUNER backdoor client and server.**\n\n|Character|Description|\n|---|---|\n|0|File contains batch commands, it executes the batch commands|\n|1|Rename the temporary file as .ps1 extension|\n|2|Rename the temporary file as .vbs extension|\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 9: Example Network Communication**\n\n**In the example, the POWRUNER client sends a random GET request to the C2 server and the C2 server**\n**sends the random number (99999999990) as a response. As the response is a random number that ends with**\n**‘0’, POWRUNER sends another random GET request to receive an additional command string. The C2**\n**server sends back Base64 encoded response.**\n\n**If the server had sent the string “not_now” as response, as shown in Figure 10, POWRUNER would have**\n**ceased any further requests and terminated its execution.**\n\n**Figure 10: Example \"not now\" server response**\n\n**POWRUNER may also receive batch commands from the C2 server to collect host information from the**\n**system This may include information about the currently logged in user the hostname network configuration**\n\n\n-----\n\n**user directories, and other data. An example batch command is provided in Figure 11.**\n\n**Figure 11: Batch commands sent by POWRUNER C2 server**\n\n**APT34 has used POWRUNER and BONDUPDATER to target Middle East organizations as early as July**\n**2017. In July 2017, a FireEye Web MPS appliance detected and blocked a request to retrieve and install an**\n**APT34 POWRUNER / BONDUPDATER downloader file. During the same month, FireEye observed APT34**\n**target a separate Middle East organization using a malicious .rtf file (MD5:**\n**63D66D99E46FB93676A4F475A65566D8)** **that exploited CVE-2017-0199. This file issued a GET request to**\n**download a malicious file from:**\n\n**hxxp://94.23.172.164/dupdatechecker.doc.**\n\n**As shown in Figure 12, the script within the dupatechecker.doc file attempts to download another file named**\n**dupatechecker.exe from the same server. The file also contains a comment by the malware author that**\n**appears to be an apparent taunt to security researchers.**\n\n**Figure 12: Contents of dupdatechecker.doc script**\n\n**The dupatechecker.exe file (MD5: C9F16F0BE8C77F0170B9B6CE876ED7FB) drops both BONDUPDATER**\n**and POWRUNER. These files connect to proxychecker[.]pro for C2.**\n\n**Recent activity by APT34 demonstrates that they are capable group with potential access to their own**\n**development resources. During the past few months, APT34 has been able to quickly incorporate exploits for**\n**at at least two publicly vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-2017-11882)** **to target organziations in the**\n**Middle East. We assess that APT34’s efforts to continuously update their malware, including the incorporation**\n**of DGA for C2, demonstrate the group’s commitment to pursing strategies to deter detection. We expect**\n**APT34 will continue to evolve their malware and tactics as they continue to pursue access to entities in the**\n\n\n-----\n\n|Filename / Domain / IP Address|MD5 Hash or Description|\n|---|---|\n|CVE-2017-11882 exploit document|A0E6933F4E0497269620F44A083B2ED4|\n|b.txt|9267D057C065EA7448ACA1511C6F29C7|\n|v.txt/v.vbs|B2D13A336A3EB7BD27612BE7D4E334DF|\n|dUpdateCheckers.base|4A7290A279E6F2329EDD0615178A11FF|\n|hUpdateCheckers.base|841CE6475F271F86D0B5188E4F8BC6DB|\n|cUpdateCheckers.bat|52CA9A7424B3CC34099AD218623A0979|\n|dUpdateCheckers.ps1|BBDE33F5709CB1452AB941C08ACC775E|\n|hUpdateCheckers.ps1|247B2A9FCBA6E9EC29ED818948939702|\n|GoogleUpdateschecker.vbs|C87B0B711F60132235D7440ADD0360B0|\n|hxxp://mumbai-m[.]site|POWRUNER C2|\n|hxxp://dns-update[.]club|Malware Staging Server|\n|CVE-2017-0199 exploit document|63D66D99E46FB93676A4F475A65566D8|\n|94.23.172.164:80|Malware Staging Server|\n|dupdatechecker.doc|D85818E82A6E64CA185EDFDDBA2D1B76|\n|dupdatechecker.exe|C9F16F0BE8C77F0170B9B6CE876ED7FB|\n\n\n**proxycheker[.]pro** **C2**\n\n\n-----\n\n**46.105.221.247**\n**hpserver[.]online**\n\n**Has resolved mumbai-m[.]site and dns-**\n**148.251.55.110**\n**update[.]club**\n\n**185.15.247.147** **Has resolved dns-update[.]club**\n\n**145.239.33.100** **Has resolved dns-update[.]club**\n\n**Has resolved ns2.dns-update[.]club &**\n**82.102.14.219**\n**hpserver[.]online & anyportals[.]com**\n\n**v7-hpserver.online.hta** **E6AC6F18256C4DDE5BF06A9191562F82**\n\n**dUpdateCheckers.base** **3C63BFF9EC0A340E0727E5683466F435**\n\n**hUpdateCheckers.base** **EEB0FF0D8841C2EBE643FE328B6D9EF5**\n\n**cUpdateCheckers.bat** **FB464C365B94B03826E67EABE4BF9165**\n\n**dUpdateCheckers.ps1** **635ED85BFCAAB7208A8B5C730D3D0A8C**\n\n**hUpdateCheckers.ps1** **13B338C47C52DE3ED0B68E1CB7876AD2**\n\n**googleupdateschecker.vbs** **DBFEA6154D4F9D7209C1875B2D5D70D5**\n\n**hpserver[.]online** **C2**\n\n**v7-anyportals.hta** **EAF3448808481FB1FDBB675BC5EA24DE**\n\n**dUpdateCheckers.base** **42449DD79EA7D2B5B6482B6F0D493498**\n\n**hUpdateCheckers.base** **A3FCB4D23C3153DD42AC124B112F1BAE**\n\n**dUpdateCheckers.ps1** **EE1C482C41738AAA5964730DCBAB5DFF**\n\n**hUpdateCheckers.ps1** **E516C3A3247AF2F2323291A670086A8F**\n\n|148.251.55.110|Has resolved mumbai-m[.]site and dns- update[.]club|\n|---|---|\n|185.15.247.147|Has resolved dns-update[.]club|\n|145.239.33.100|Has resolved dns-update[.]club|\n|82.102.14.219|Has resolved ns2.dns-update[.]club & hpserver[.]online & anyportals[.]com|\n|v7-hpserver.online.hta|E6AC6F18256C4DDE5BF06A9191562F82|\n|dUpdateCheckers.base|3C63BFF9EC0A340E0727E5683466F435|\n|hUpdateCheckers.base|EEB0FF0D8841C2EBE643FE328B6D9EF5|\n|cUpdateCheckers.bat|FB464C365B94B03826E67EABE4BF9165|\n|dUpdateCheckers.ps1|635ED85BFCAAB7208A8B5C730D3D0A8C|\n|hUpdateCheckers.ps1|13B338C47C52DE3ED0B68E1CB7876AD2|\n|googleupdateschecker.vbs|DBFEA6154D4F9D7209C1875B2D5D70D5|\n|hpserver[.]online|C2|\n|v7-anyportals.hta|EAF3448808481FB1FDBB675BC5EA24DE|\n|dUpdateCheckers.base|42449DD79EA7D2B5B6482B6F0D493498|\n|hUpdateCheckers.base|A3FCB4D23C3153DD42AC124B112F1BAE|\n|dUpdateCheckers.ps1|EE1C482C41738AAA5964730DCBAB5DFF|\n\n\n-----\n\n**This entry was posted on Thu Dec 07 12:00:00 EST 2017 and filed under Yogesh Londhe, Nalani Fraser,**\n**Vincent Cannon, Threat Research, Manish Sardiwal, Jaqueline O’Leary, Nicholos Richard, Middle East, and**\n**APT.**\n\n**Get information and insight on today's advanced threats from the leader in advanced**\n**threat prevention.**\n\n# First Name\n\n Last Name\n\n Email Address\n\n Company Name\n\n**Executive Perspective Blog**\n\n**Threat Research Blog**\n\n**Products and Services Blog**\n\n**Subscribe**\n\n**Contact Us**\n**+1 888-227-2721**\n\n**Company**\n\n**About FireEye**\n\n**Customer Stories**\n\n**Careers**\n\n**Partners**\n\n**[Investor Relations](http://investors.fireeye.com/)**\n\n\n**Get information and insight on today's advanced threats from the leader in advanced**\n**threat prevention.**\n\n# First Name\n\n Last Name\n\n Email Address\n\n Company Name\n\n**Executive Perspective Blog**\n\n**Threat Research Blog**\n\n**Products and Services Blog**\n\n**Subscribe**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Newsroom**\n\n**Press Releases**\n\n**Webinars**\n\n**Events**\n\n**Blogs**\n\n**[Communication Preferences](https://www2.fireeye.com/manage-your-preferences.html)**\n\n**Technical Support**\n\n**Incident?**\n\n**Report Security Issue**\n\n**Contact Support**\n\n**[Customer Portal](https://csportal.fireeye.com/secur/login_portal.jsp?orgId=00D3000000063LS&portalId=06030000000pSNE)**\n\n**[Communities](https://community.fireeye.com/welcome)**\n\n**[Documentation Portal](https://docs.fireeye.com)**\n\n**Cyber Threat Map**\n\n**Copyright © 2017 FireEye, Inc.
