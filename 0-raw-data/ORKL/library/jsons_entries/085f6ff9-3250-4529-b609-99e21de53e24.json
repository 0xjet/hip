Ironically the decoy document is a deceptive flyer\n[relating to the Cyber Conflict U.S. conference. CyCon US is a collaborative effort between the](http://aci.cvent.com/events/2017-international-conference-on-cyber-conflict-cycon-u-s-/event-summary-004d598d31684f21ac82050a9000369f.aspx)\nArmy Cyber Institute at the United States Military Academy and the NATO Cooperative Cyber\nMilitary Academy and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. Due to the\nnature of this document, we assume that this campaign targets people with an interest in cyber\nsecurity. Unlike previous campaigns from this actor, the flyer does not contain an Office exploit\nor a 0-day, it simply contains a malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro.\n\nThe VBA drops and executes a new variant of Seduploader. This reconnaissance malware has\nbeen used by Group 74 for years and it is composed of 2 files: a dropper and a payload. The\ndropper and the payload are quite similar to the previous versions but the author modified\nsome public information such as MUTEX name, obfuscation keys... We assume that these\nmodifications were performed to avoid detection based on public IOCs.\n\nThe article describes the malicious document and the Seduploader reconnaissance malware,\nespecially the difference with the previous versions.\n\n## Malicious Office Document\n\n### Decoy Document\n\n[The decoy document is a flyer concerning the Cyber Conflict U.S. conference with the following](http://aci.cvent.com/events/2017-international-conference-on-cyber-conflict-cycon-u-s-/event-summary-004d598d31684f21ac82050a9000369f.aspx)\nfilename Conference_on_Cyber_Conflict.doc. It contains 2 pages with the logo of the\norganizer and the sponsors:\n\n\n-----\n\nD t th t f th d t th t th t t d l li k d\n\n\n-----\n\n[online on the conference website. The attackers probably copy/pasted it into Word to create](http://aci.cvent.com/events/2017-international-conference-on-cyber-conflict-cycon-u-s-/event-summary-004d598d31684f21ac82050a9000369f.aspx)\nthe malicious document.\n\n### VBA\n\nThe Office document contains a VBA script. Here is the code:\n\nThe goal of this code is to get information from the properties of the document (\"Subject\",\n\"Company\", \"Category\", \"Hyperlink base\" and finally \"Comments\"). Some of this information\ncan be directly extracted from the Windows explorer by looking at the properties of the file.\nThe \"Hyperlink Base\" must be extracted using another tool, strings is capable of obtaining this\nby looking for long strings Pay close attention to the contents of these fields as they appear\n\n\n-----\n\nThis extracted information is concatenated together to make a single variable. This variable is\ndecoded with the base64 algorithm in order to get a Windows library (PE file) which is written\nto disk. The file is named netwf.dat. On the next step this file is executed by rundll32.exe via\nthe KlpSvc export. We see that this file drops 2 additional files: netwf.bat and netwf.dll. The\nfinal part of the VBA script changes the properties of these two files, setting their attributes to\nHidden. We can also see 2 VBA variable names: PathPld, probably for Path Payload, and\nPathPldBt, for Path Payload Batch.\n\n## Seduploader Variant\n\n### Dropper Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\ncontain privilege escalation and it simply executes the payload and configures persistence\nmechanisms. The dropper installs 2 files:\n\nnetwf.bat : executes netwf.dll\nnetwf.dll : the payload\n\nThe dropper implements 2 persistence mechanisms:\n\nHKCU\\Environment\\UserInitMprLogonScript to execute the netwf.bat file\nCOM Object hijack of the following CLSID: {BCDE0395-E52F-467C-8E3D[C4579291692E}, the CLSID of the class MMDeviceEnumerator.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd371399(v=vs.85).aspx)\n\nThese 2 techniques have also been previously used by this actor.\n\nFinally the payload is executed by rundll32.exe (and the ordinal #1 in argument) or by\nexplorer.exe if the COM Object hijack is performed. In this case, explorer.exe will instance the\nMMDeviceEnumerator class and will execute the payload.\n\n### Payload Analysis\n\nThe payload features are similar to the previous versions of Seduploader. We can compare it\nto the sample e338d49c270baf64363879e5eecb8fa6bdde8ad9 used in May 2017 by Group\n74. Of the 195 functions of the new sample, 149 are strictly identical, 16 match at 90% and 2\nmatch at 80%:\n\nIn the previous campaign where adversaries used Office document exploits as an infection\nvector, the payload was executed in the Office word process. In this campaign, adversaries did\nnot use any exploit. Instead,the payload is executed in standalone mode by rundll32.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe key in our version is:\n\nkey=b\"\\x08\\x7A\\x05\\x04\\x60\\x7c\\x3e\\x3c\\x5d\\x0b\\x18\\x3c\\x55\\x64\"\n\nThe MUTEX name is different too: FG00nxojVs4gLBnwKc7HhmdK0h\n\nHere are some of the Seduploader features:\n\nScreenshot capture (with the GDI API);\ndata/configuration exfiltration;\nExecution of code;\nFile downloading;\n\n\n-----\n\ninvestigation, the server did not provide any configuration to the infected machines. Based on\nthe metadata of the Office documents and the PE files, the attackers had created the file on\nWednesday, the 4th of October. We can see, in Cisco Umbrella, a peak in activities 3 days\nlater, Saturday the 7th of October:\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAnalysis of this campaign shows us once more that attackers are creative and use the news to\ncompromise the targets. This campaign has most likely been created to allow the targeting of\npeople linked to or interested by cybersecurity, so probably the people who are more sensitive\nto cybersecurity threats. In this case, Group 74 did not use an exploit or any 0-day but simply\nused scripting language embedded within the Microsoft Office document. Due to this change,\nthe fundamental compromise mechanism is different as the payload is executed in a\nstandalone mode. The reasons for this are unknown, but, we could suggest that they did not\nwant to utilize any exploits to ensure they remained viable for any other operations. Actors will\noften not use exploits due to the fact that researchers can find and eventually patch these\nwhich renders the actors weaponized platforms defunct. Additionally the author did some small\nupdates after publications from the security community, again this is common for actors of this\nsophisticated nature, once their campaigns have been exposed they will often try to change\ntooling to ensure better avoidance. For example the actor changed the XOR key and the\nMUTEX name. We assume that these modifications were performed in order to avoid\ndetection based on public IOCs.\n\n## Coverage\n\nAdditional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\nideally suited to prevent the execution of\nthe malware used by these threat actors.\n\n[CWS or WSA web scanning prevents](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/cloud-web-security/index.html)\naccess to malicious websites and detects\nmalware used in these attacks.\n\n[Email Security can block malicious emails](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security-appliance/index.html)\nsent by threat actors as part of their\ncampaign.\n\nNetwork Security appliances such\n[asNGFW,NGIPS, andMeraki MX can](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/firewalls/index.html)\ndetect malicious activity associated with\nthis threat.\n\n[AMP Threat Grid helps identify malicious binaries and build protection into all Cisco Security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/amp-threat-grid/index.html)\nproducts.\n\n[Umbrella, our secure internet gateway (SIG), blocks users from connecting to malicious](https://umbrella.cisco.com/)\ndomains, IPs, and URLs, whether users are on or off the corporate network.\n\nOpen Source Snort Subscriber Rule Set customers can stay up to date by downloading the\n[latest rule pack available for purchase on Snort.org.](https://www.snort.org/products)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Files\n\nOffice Documents:\n\nc4be15f9ccfecf7a463f3b1d4a17e7b4f95de939e057662c3f97b52f7fa3c52f\ne5511b22245e26a003923ba476d7c36029939b2d1936e17a9b35b396467179ae\nefb235776851502672dba5ef45d96cc65cb9ebba1b49949393a6a85b9c822f52\n\nSeduploader Dropper:\n\n522fd9b35323af55113455d823571f71332e53dde988c2eb41395cf6b0c15805\n\nSedupload Payload:\n\nef027405492bc0719437eb58c3d2774cc87845f30c40040bbebbcc09a4e3dd18\n\n### Networks\n\n\n-----\n\nmyinvestgroup[.]com\n\n\n-----",
