This ransomware is the\nrebranded version of an earlier ransomware named Chaos. The latter has been in the wild\nsince June 2021. After encryption, the Yashma ransomware dropped a ransom note titled\n“read_it.txt” in each encrypted folder and the desktop.\n\n**Yashma Analysis:**\n\nMD5: 1063360427174b7e44ed747e6d78e034\n\nFile Type: EXE\n\nThe ransomware is written in Basic.NET and is 32-bit executable with compiler time stamp –\nWed May 18 11:06:18 2022.\n\nThe ransomware checks for the country based on the current input language. It will terminate\nif the country is Azerbaijan or Turkey.\n\n\n-----\n\nThen the ransomware makes registry changes by adding mutex to the current user registry.\nNext, it starts the execution and while executing checks whether any other instance is\nalready running. If yes, it will terminate itself.\n\nThe ransomware then copies itself to Appdata Roaming folder with filename svchost.exe.\nPost this, the ransomware will sleep for 200 milliseconds.\n\nThe ransomware deletes the shadow copies and backup, while also disabling the recovery\nmode and task manager.\n\nvssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet & wmic shadowcopy delete\nbcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit /set {default}\nrecoveryenabled no\nwbadmin delete catalog -quiet\n\nIt will stop a listing of backup services that are running in the background at a time when the\nransomware instance is running.\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is the list of valid extensions it will check before encrypting the file.\n\nThe ransomware excludes the following directories from the encryption.\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is the list of directories whose content the ransomware will encrypt.\n\nThe ransomware looks for drives to spread the ransomware over the network so that it\nmoves laterally and infects other devices.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ransomware then encrypts the file using AES-256 encryption algorithm with the key size\nof 128 bits.\n\nThe password for the encryption is randomly generated.\n\nThe ransomware maintains persistence by modifying the registry change and creating\nshortcuts.\n\nIt will change the screensaver of the victim’s system by changing it into a .jpg image. This\nimage is generated by the attacker with random characters.\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is the RSA key used for this ransomware sample.\n\nThe major differences between the earlier version of Chaos and Yashma ransomware are as\nfollows.\n\nThe new version has hardcoded country names to prevent it from targeting certain\ngeographies. This is detected based on the language setting on the user’s system.\nThe earlier version of Chaos could only encrypt files reaching up to the size of 1MB\nand would destroy any file over this size limit. However, Yashma is able to encrypt\nlarger files.\n\nBelow is the comparison between the earlier version of Chaos and Yashma.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n“Yashma” ransomware can be distributed by using tactics like social engineering, phishing,\nspam email, malicious attachment, etc. Yashma ransomware is based on the Chaos\nransomware builder. Chaos ransomware builder is still far from being complete since it lacks\nfeatures that new ransomware possesses, such as the ability to collect data from victims that\ncould be used for further blackmail if the ransom is not paid or deploy DDOS attack to force\nthe victims into paying the ransom.\n\n**TTPs based on MITRE ATT&CK Framework:**\n\n**Sr No.** **Tactic** **Technique**\n\n1 Discovery (TA0007) T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery\n\nT1083: File and Directory Discovery\n\nT1135: Network Share Discovery\n\nT1049: System Network Connections Discovery\n\n2 Execution (TA0002) T1106: Native API\n\nT1059.003: Windows Command Shell\n\n3 Persistence (TA0003) T1547 Boot or Logon Auto-start Execution\n\n\n-----\n\n4 Defensive Evasion (TA0005) T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information\n\n5 Collection (TA0009) T1005: Data from Local System\n\n6 Impact (TA0040) T1486: Data Encrypted for impact\n\nT1489: Service Stop\n\nT1490: Inhibit System Recovery\n\n[Back to Listing](https://www.cyfirma.com/out-of-band/)\n\n\n-----",
