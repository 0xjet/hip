INTRODUCTION\n\nAs technology advances and new devices join the ranks of those connected to the Internet, new vul­\nnerabilities and challenges in the security of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT)\nsystems come along for the ride. This white paper will explore the changes in malware throughout the past\nseveral years, with a focus on what the security industry is most likely to see today; how asset owners can\nharden existing networks and systems against these attacks; and the expected direction of developments\nand targets in the coming years.\n\n##### 1.1  State of the Battlefield\n\nAs individuals and corporations ramp up the number of connected devices on their networks, the vol­\nume of personal and confidential information transmitted around the world has grown to an all-time high.\nIn the pursuit of this information, attackers have taken a renewed interest in exfiltration from both individ­\nual and corporate environments.\n\nCompounding the risk, rapid evolution of technology has caused the development rate of software to\nsoar. Increased volume amplifies the potential for exposure, heightening the need for heavy software re­\nview and testing. However, vendors sometimes neglect security and validation of software because of the\nneed for rapid development. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) vulnerability sta­\ntistics[1] show a significant increase in the number of software vulnerabilities reported over the past 2 years.\nIn 2014, 7,937 vulnerabilities were found in software, as compared to 5,186 in 2013—a 34.6 percent\nincrease. The trend seems to be continuing with 5,619 vulnerabilities reported as of November 1, 2015.\n\nIndustrial control systems (ICS) devices are following a similar trend in vulnerability discovery. In\n2015, the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICSCERT) coordinated 177 new\nvulnerabilities. In 2014, there were 161 reported vulnerabilities and in 2013, 181 reported vulnerabilities.[2]\nThese numbers suggest that the discovery of vulnerabilities in ICS devices is still a growing field and that\nthe number of discoveries is likely to increase as researcher interest expands.\n\nAs the malware industry grows, more and more people throughout the world are training to find vul­\nnerabilities in software and system configurations. Software vendors are pushing security patches quicker\nthan ever.[ 3] However, because of the slow nature of the way patches and upgrades are often handled in\npersonal, corporate, and OT environments, victims may still be susceptible to vulnerabilities that develop­\ners had patched months or even years before.\n\nMoving forward, it is likely that these patterns of attack will expand to new devices and include an\nincreasing interest in zero-day vulnerabilities. The struggle between attackers and defenders is destined to\nbe never-ending; however, consistent patching practices and a maintained awareness of new vulnerability\nreports for systems on the network can help reduce the attack surface. According to the 2015 Verizon Data\nBreach Investigation Report (DBIR), “99.9% of the exploited vulnerabilities were compromised more\nthan a year after the CVE [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures] was published.”[ 4]\n\n[1. https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/statistics, NIST vulnerability statistics](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/statistics)\n[2. https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/Year-Review-2014, ICS-CERT year end review for 2014](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/Year-Review-2014)\n[3. https://secunia.com/?action=fetch&filename=secunia_vulnerability_review_2014.pdf, Secunia review of vulnera­](https://secunia.com/?action=fetch&filename=secunia_vulnerability_review_2014.pdf)\nbility patch availability in 2011 through 2014, page 103\n[4. http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_data-breach-investigation-report_2015_en_xg.pdf- pg. 15,](http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_data-breach-investigation-report_2015_en_xg.pdf)\nDi i th i t f t hi d t b h\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2. ATTACKER TACTIC CHANGES\n\nHistorically, most shifts in attacker posture have been gradual, and we see this confirmed in recent\nincidents. Typically, malware capabilities will vary based on the end goals of the malware author and the\ntargeted entity. However, the overall shift toward robustness, along with a push to specifically attack end\nuser devices of interest, can be seen across all campaigns, which have targeted industrial, corporate, and\npersonal environments.\n\n##### 2.1  Malware as a Service\n\nMalware as a service (MaaS) and related variants[5] are creating a market for malicious software and\ndistributed targeting that have gained a great deal of popularity in the past 4 years. This market provides a\ncustomer (the attacker) with access to exploits, use of a botnet, or the creation and distribution of mal­\nware. Essentially, attackers can outsource much, if not all the technical load, for a price.\n\nThe market for malware is growing rapidly, and while it is not tied to any specific group of threat ac­\ntors or family of malware, it significantly lowers the technological barrier to entry for would-be criminals.\nHigh-end services, such as those sold by firms such as Hacking Team,[ 6] Vupen,[7] or Zerodium,[ 8] allow cus­\ntomers to access and utilize advanced exploits, including zero-day attacks, on demand. Many other groups\noffer a variety of tools such as user-friendly malware customization and simple point-and-click distrib­\nuted denial-of-service (DDoS) solutions backed by massive botnets. These services operate using robust\nbusiness models, such as enterprise level support to customers, creating an underground community and\nmarketplace for attackers.[ 9] This increases the accessibility of intrusion and market disruption, and reduces\nthe overhead for launching a campaign down to a simple, nominal fee, eliminating the need for technical\nknowledge and resources on the part of the attacker.\n\nAs online services and cloud storage become increasingly ubiquitous, some exploit and malware de­\nvelopers are shifting their focus from gathering information and performing breaches on live networks to\ndevelopment of the exploits and tools required to accomplish these operations. This creates a shift toward\nspecialization, allowing third parties to decide what information they want to target and malware develop­\ners to hone their craft. It also serves to separate the malware and exploit developers from the crimes being\ncommitted. This model continues to yield substantial monetary compensation for all parties and their\nefforts, while affording the developers a more stable and predictable income and lifestyle, with less risk of\napprehension.\n\nThis transition mirrors the software development transition the industry has seen in web-based software\nas a service (SaaS), as well as platforms as a service (PaaS). These product models became popular in 2001\nand reached widespread adoption from 2005 to 2008. Overall, this shift has led to higher quality products\nand more focused attacks. Section 3 will cover these changes in malware development in more detail.\n\n##### 2.2  Destructive Malware\n\nIn a major recent trend, attackers have targeted a wide range of systems with destructive malware.\nThis variety targets a user’s files, specifically or indiscriminately, and renders them inaccessible. These\n\n5. Variants include Hacking as a Service (HaaS), Crimeware as a Service (CaaS) and Fraud as a service (FaaS)\n[6. www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/8899353/The-spies-behind-your-screen.html - Article discussing the hacking](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/8899353/The-spies-behind-your-screen.html)\nteam company and their market for both offensive and defensive utilities\n7. www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/03/21/meet-the-hackers-who-sell-spies-the-tools-to-crack-your-pcand-get-paid-six-figure-fees/#6cc1ba694483 – Vupen article detailing the goals and products of the exploit developer\n[8. https://threatpost.com/vupen-launches-new-zero-day-acquisition-firm-zerodium/113933 - Article detailing the](https://threatpost.com/vupen-launches-new-zero-day-acquisition-firm-zerodium/113933)\nZerodium acquisition firm, created by the founders of Vupen and focused on acquiring exploits.\n[9. https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/72652/breaches-carnivals-and-cybercrime-a-look-inside-the-brazilli­](https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/72652/breaches-carnivals-and-cybercrime-a-look-inside-the-brazillian-underground/)\n[an-underground/ - Exploration of the criminal sharing of malicious services and applications between cyber crimi­](https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/72652/breaches-carnivals-and-cybercrime-a-look-inside-the-brazillian-underground/)\n\nl i B il\n\n\n-----\n\nattacks result in the most significant losses when used against corporate entities because of large costs\nassociated with recovery. In the Sony Pictures Entertainment attack in December 2014, where malware\nwiped victim hard drives,[ 10] they estimated the total cost of recovery to be $15 million.[ 11]\n\nDestructive malware can be devastating to an unprepared victim. The best mitigation strategy relies\non regular, frequent data backups and network hardening. Potential signs of infection include unusual\nfile corruption discovery, frequent system lockups, and in the case of ransomware, a message demanding\nmonetary compensation in exchange for restoration of the victims files. To raise awareness and provide re­\nmediation and mitigation strategies, ICS-CERT has released a document[12] addressing destructive malware\nas a whole.\n\n###### 2.2.1  Ransomware\n\nRansomware is a form of malware that has been around for over 25 years,[ 13] but it did not gain much\ntraction until 2013. Because of the expansion of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, which allow the un­\ntraceable transfers of funds, along with the ease of development and a strong return on investment (ROI),\nthese attacks are seeing rapid growth. In the first quarter of 2015, McAfee Labs observed a 165 percent\nincrease in new ransomware over the fourth quarter of 2014 with approximately 725,000 observed new\nransomware samples over the previous quarter’s 270,000.[ 14]\n\nThe goal of ransomware involves gaining access to a user’s device and iterating through his or her\npersonal files, encrypting everything of interest with a key typically known only by the attacker. The\nattacker then makes a demand, usually a transfer of funds through a currency such as Bitcoin or Money­\npak, in exchange for decryption of the files. The attacker places a time limit on the user to acquiesce to the\nattacker’s demands after which the files will be permanently unrecoverable.\n\nDuring the last 2 years, a significant amount of growth in the quality and distribution of ransomware\nindicates that this genus of malware is on the rise and will not be short lived. Famous examples of ran­\nsomware include CryptoLocker (which was shut down when the Gameover ZeuS botnet was disrupted),\nalong with CryptoWall, TorrentLocker, and most recently, TeslaCrypt.\n\nRansomware employs many of the same tactics used by other malware to avoid detection and operate\nstealthily. Attackers frequently use network-hiding tools such as Tor in such attacks.\n\nIt is highly likely that ransomware will continue to grow as a source of concern. They are relatively\nsimple for attackers to create; the potential payouts are massive; and remediation methods are difficult\nonce the attack has compromised the victim. The most effective defense against these attacks, as with\npurely destructive malware, is regular, frequent backups of systems. Without a backup of a compromised\nsystem, the asset owner is at the mercy of the attacker. Even more critical, a piece of ransomware in an\nICS environment could cause a long-term disruption of service before administrators can restore the sys­\ntem to working condition.\n\nIn its 2015 Global Security Report, Trustwave found that purchasing ransomware yielded a 1,425 percent\nROI. These returns are possible due to MaaS groups delivering the crimeware, the necessary exploits, and the\ndistribution methods for attackers to use to target a larger number of victims with increasing effectiveness.\n\n[10. http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/an-analysis-of-the-destructive-malware-behind-fbi-](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/an-analysis-of-the-destructive-malware-behind-fbi-warnings/)\n[warnings/ - analysis of the destructive malware thought to have infected the Sony network.](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/an-analysis-of-the-destructive-malware-behind-fbi-warnings/)\n[11. www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-sony-hack-cost-20150204-story.html - cost of Sony](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-sony-hack-cost-20150204-story.html)\nPictures Entertainment hack in damage and recovery.\n[12. https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/tips/ICS-TIP-15-022-01 - ICS-CERT mitigation strategies against destructive malware](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/tips/ICS-TIP-15-022-01)\n[13. https://medium.com/un-hackable/the-bizarre-pre-internet-history-of-ransomware-bb480a652b4b - A historical](https://medium.com/un-hackable/the-bizarre-pre-internet-history-of-ransomware-bb480a652b4b)\nbeginning to Ransomware\n[14. www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2015.pdf - An analysis of new ransomware seen](http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2015.pdf)\nf Q1 2013 t Q1 2015 14\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 3. MALWARE EVOLUTION\n\n 3.1  Design Changes\n\nIn the early history of cybersecurity, it was common to see one of two directions taken in an attack\ninvolving malware: 1) using many different tools, each for a different purpose; or 2) using a single piece\nof malware with an extensive feature set. In recent years, the anatomy of an attack has grown more cohe­\nsive. Instead of employing many unrelated tools from varying teams or a massive all-purpose application,\nmodern malware has opted to take an approach similar to current large-scale software. In malware such as\nPlugX,[ 15] the authors have created a platform providing extensible functionality through a plugin inter­\nface. These plugins add new functionality, such as gathering a user’s password hashes or monitoring for\nanti-malware applications, providing attackers with the flexibility to adapt their strategies and tool deploy­\nments to new situations and environments.\n\nThis kind of modular design hinders the detection and analysis of malware. By extending function­\nality through plugins, and only deploying the plugins specifically desired to a compromised host, the full\narsenal of the attacker remains unknown to researchers. By finding only the loader platform, analysts may\nhave little idea of what occurred on the system or the attacker’s goals without also locating plugins or fo­\nrensic artifacts. Malware families that include a primary backdoor and/or a remote administration capabil­\nity provide an attacker with arbitrary access to a compromised host. An attacker may take any number of\nactions with that level of access, which can significantly complicate forensic analysis.\n\nWhere it used to be common to see major malware families spread like wildfire without care for who\nthe end victims were, we are now seeing much more deliberately targeted attacks on single victims. On\nPage 22 of their 2015 DBIR, Verizon says, “70-90% of malware samples are unique to an organization.”[ 16]\nThis is both 1) a result of custom-built malware, designed for one-time use against a single entity; poly­\nmorphic malware, which is altered for each distribution to disrupt detection from antivirus applications;\nand 2) tailored versions of plugin-based malware, which leverage specific functionality to accomplish the\nattacker’s goal at specific victim sites.\n\n##### 3.2  Obstructing the Analyst\n\nAs the complexity and distribution of malware rises, techniques used by malicious authors to hide\ntheir work have improved. Attackers have spent a large amount of effort making the job of analyzing mal­\nware more difficult and time consuming. Increasing numbers of anti-sandbox, anti-debug, and anti-analy­\nsis techniques (such as dead code, encryption, and junk code) inhibits both static and dynamic analysis of\napplications, causing delays in the response time of researchers and analysts.\n\nSignificant growth in techniques to evade initial detection for new malware samples is a major issue\nfor those working to protect networks. Observed tactics include anti-emulation techniques, packing, nar­\nrow dissemination, and executing and residing only in memory, among others. Each of these techniques\ncan lead analysts down a rabbit hole of misdirection or even completely prevent analysis.\n\n[15. http://labs.lastline.com/an-analysis-of-plugx - Analysis of the PlugX malware that covers the architecture of the](http://labs.lastline.com/an-analysis-of-plugx)\nbase application and plugins\n[16. http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_data-breach-investigation-report_2015_en_xg.pdf - p22,](http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_data-breach-investigation-report_2015_en_xg.pdf)\nVerizon discussion of the targeting seen in malware\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 1.

These attackers have significantly lowered the\nbar for advanced malware development.\n\nMuch of the malware that is publicly available is well known and has been seen in various attacks for\na significant period of time, such as Zeus, gh0st, and Carberp. As new catalogs leak from groups such as\nthe 2015 Hacking Team release, new, previously unknown malware and zero-days enter into the public\narena. Attackers often redesign or repurpose these kinds of tools, adding new capabilities and changing the\npotential impact of the malware.\n\nICS devices are not an exception for this market. While attacking ICS devices is appealing to a much\nsmaller audience, multiple development firms have been in the business of finding, creating, and selling\nexploits for major ICS vendor products. Currently, businesses are creating penetration tools against super­\nvisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems[17] designed for security testing of ICS environments.\nWhile these tools have real-world application for testing the resiliency of the network against malicious\nactors, these resources pose a real danger due to their exposure of live ammunition when in the hands of\nan attacker.\n\nOne concern for analysts with the splitting of a piece of malware into many variants is that it becomes\nmuch more difficult to categorize based on previously observed behaviors. This forces malware analysts\nto find connections between the new varieties and perhaps their creators. It is likely that new teams who\nhave picked up these packages will have different goals for the repurposed frameworks than the original\ndesigners. Therefore, they will require reassessment and consideration when found again in the wild. This\nhas led to drastic shifts in previously known samples, such as the evolution of BlackEnergy from a sim­\nplistic DDoS application[18] to a plugin driven, multi-platform back door utility in BlackEnergy 2 and 3.\n\n17. www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2015/10/21/scada-zero-day-exploit-sales/#4ffc11dd96c – Forbes article\ndetailing the SCADA device exploit market\n[18. http://atlas-public.ec2.arbor.net/docs/BlackEnergy+DDoS+Bot+Analysis.pdf - Analysis of the original BlackEn­](http://atlas-public.ec2.arbor.net/docs/BlackEnergy+DDoS+Bot+Analysis.pdf)\nergy botnet in 2007\n\n|Technique Environment Checking|Description The application checks to see if it is being debugged, emulated, or running under a virtual machine (VM), and then either stops executing or redirects execution flow to an alternate path.

PERSISTENCE METHODS\n\nAttackers and researchers have developed a number of mechanisms for maintaining persistence and\ncontinued access on compromised systems. As antivirus vendors push new signatures with greater speeds\nand continue to improve heuristics, threat actors have had to adopt new techniques to evade detection and\npreserve their control on hosts.\n\nA common persistence technique used by malicious applications is to alter entries of the compromised\nsystem’s registry and file system to ensure execution after the asset owner has rebooted the system. Tech­\nniques to do this are numerous and vary depending on the operating system. Common Windows methods\ninclude adding an entry to the system’s or user’s Run registry key, placing the executable or a shortcut\nin a user’s startup folder, scheduling a task to launch the malware directly at certain times or events, or\nreplacing a commonly accessed resource or legitimate application to load a malicious dynamic link library\n(DLL).\n\nThese techniques have proven effective and the level of complexity varies between different families\nof malware. Avoiding the primary file system is typically ideal, as antivirus programs focus on searching\nthe standard file system for evidence of an infection with less emphasis on memory. This has led to a num­\nber of unusual and novel approaches to hiding code in places that today’s antivirus applications would not\nnormally scan, such as the file-less trojan Poweliks[19] storing itself in the Windows registry.\n\n##### 4.1  USB Firmware\n\nMany attacks have made use of universal serial bus (USB) memory sticks to spread into devices\noutside of the traditional network methods, the most infamous of which was Stuxnet.[ 20] USB attacks are\nunique due to the potential for infection on devices that are physically isolated from unsecured networks,\nalso known as “air gapping.” This is particularly relevant to ICS environments with separate operational\nand business networks. These environments are out of reach to attackers using more traditional network\ninfection vectors.\n\nUSB attacks have become more robust over the years, ranging from simple executables that live\non the file system of a portable storage device to the actual firmware of a USB device, which the USB\ncontroller chip executes each time the device connects to a computer. This infection vector is particularly\ndangerous because it puts users of any type of USB device at risk, not just those using storage devices. In\naddition, the infection could be difficult to detect, silently spreading from device to device as users attach\nand detach USB components around the company. This could allow malware to propagate and spread until\na user attaches it to a device with access to the Internet or the malware reaches its final target.\n\nBecause of these risks, it is prudent for companies and individuals to know the hardware they are pur­\nchasing and using comes from trusted sources, and never to use their hardware on untrusted machines. Miti­\ngation of this kind of attack relies on segregation of devices: keep all trusted hardware devices off untrusted\nmachines, such as personal laptops or mobile devices, and keep all untrusted devices off trusted machines.\n\nEducation of users is paramount in preventing these kinds of attacks, because many users do not\nunderstand the risks associated with the technology. A study[21] by CompTIA placed unlabeled USB devices\nin high traffic areas with links in their root directory prompting users to click them.

However, the greatest\nreduction from these behavior-based attacks is the education of users.\n\n##### 4.2  BIOS\n\nOne of the places to hide low-level persistence mechanisms has been in the master boot record (MBR)\nor volume boot record (VBR) of the boot disk.[ 22] The MBR and VBR are low level and include instruc­\ntions that execute before the OS has booted, and before any antivirus software has loaded. This makes\ninfections at this level potentially untraceable through memory or process scanning performed at the OS\nlevel. These attacks will rarely implant any files into the actual OS file system, instead opting for code\ninjection directly into process memory[23] or within sectors of the disk not addressable by the OS.[ 24] Any\nmalicious payloads that execute in this manner may contain a component that manipulates any reads from\nthe OS to the MBR or VBR to return the original, expected codes rather than the true modified version,\nmaking the payload nearly undetectable at the user level.\n\nBasic Input/Output System (BIOS) level malware takes a lower level approach than MBR and VBR\nbootkits, infecting the actual code running immediately after powering on a system. This form of malware\nis particularly dangerous, as the BIOS has privileged access to hardware on boot. Any code injected into\nthe BIOS could directly affect any aspect of the system by executing at a lower level than any other code\non the system. Researchers saw this kind of attack in the wild as early as 2011 in the Membromi virus,[25]\nidentified as an infection spreading through China, and demonstrated by researchers through proof of con­\ncepts such as lighteater[26] in 2015.\n\nWhat makes this particular form of malware more threatening is that a great deal of remediation tech­\nniques—such as reformatting the device, or running entirely off a live disc—do not mitigate the risk. Only\nfully restoring the BIOS of the motherboard would take it out, a process that IT personnel typically avoid\nbecause of a higher potential for costly issues to arise during flashing. Even with this level of remediation,\nre-flashing assumes that the malware has not modified the internal flashing process during its time on the\nbox, which could make any flashing via software ineffective or destructive and would require specific\nhardware devices to flash the board directly. Ultimately, this kind of exploitation can easily lead to a full\nreplacement of hardware because of the asset owner’s inability to determine if they have truly eradicated\nthe malware.\n\nLegacy BIOS infections have fallen off in the wake of Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI),\na specification for the interface between an operating system and platform firmware. UEFI introduced in\n2005 to modernize the boot process and fix the limitations in both security and functionality of legacy\nBIOS. While the standard has been in place since 2005, implementation details continue to differ between\nmanufacturers and adoption of such a large standard takes time. As a result, research into security issues\nof UEFI have only begun to gain momentum recently, with research released in 2012 for Mac Extensible\n\n[22. www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/are-mbr-infections-back-fashion-infographic - Highlights the history of MBR](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/are-mbr-infections-back-fashion-infographic)\nand VBR malware as it rose in popularity.\n[23. http://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2014/08/angler-ek-now-capable-of-fileless.html - Malware injection directly](http://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2014/08/angler-ek-now-capable-of-fileless.html)\ninto process memory\n[24. https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00001393.html - Analysis of MBR Rootkits for Backdoor.Win32.](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00001393.html)\nSinowal.Y from F-Secure\n[25. www.webroot.com/blog/2011/09/13/mebromi-the-first-bios-rootkit-in-the-wild/ - Documentation of the Membro­](http://www.webroot.com/blog/2011/09/13/mebromi-the-first-bios-rootkit-in-the-wild/)\nmi BIOS attack\n[26. www.legbacore.com/Research_files/HowManyMillionBIOSWouldYouLikeToInfect_Full2.pdf - Researcher-de­](http://www.legbacore.com/Research_files/HowManyMillionBIOSWouldYouLikeToInfect_Full2.pdf)\nveloped lighteater is a malware tool for infecting PC BIOS.\n\n\n-----\n\nFirmware Interface rootkits[27] and the first proof of concept to defeat the Windows 8 secure boot system\ncoming in 2013 in the form of DreamBoot.[ 28]\n\nThe leaked HackingTeam documents contained details of a partial implementation of a UEFI rootkit\nwith many of the same exploitations seen in prior BIOS malware. Trend Micro[29] and Intel’s Advanced\nThreat Research[30] have dissected the leaked code and provided analysis of the source code, showing that\nif there is security in place on the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) flash of the UEFI, one would have to\nflash the exploit by physically accessing the PC. However, they point out that this sort of attack may even­\ntually be available in the wild without such requirements. With the leaked code, any malware authors who\nare interested in recreating the technique will benefit from this head start on development.\n\nResearchers have been on the hunt for issues with UEFI and have found a number of vulnerabilities.\nHowever, while UEFI may have some of the same problems that plagued standard BIOS firmware devic­\nes, support built into the standard, such as Secure Boot,[ 31] have improved the security of the BIOS. Intel\nSecurity has done a great deal of research on reducing vulnerabilities in UEFI motherboards currently in\nproduction, and Kaspersky has released a product aimed directly at scanning at the UEFI level for mal­\nware.[ 32] Other companies, such as VirusTotal,[ 33] have also been searching for stronger characterization of\nmalicious firmware images through analysis. Despite these efforts, the topic is still a major concern within\nthe field.\n\nDetection of UEFI malware can be time consuming, but there are tools, such as CHIPSEC[34] and\nUEFITool,[ 35] to allow for image extraction and exploration. These tools utilize system drivers to allow for\ndirect access to the low-level firmware. However, much like the possibility of the infected BIOS serv­\ning an incompatible flashing tool, the returned examination of the UEFI layer by the kernel may also be\nspoofed. The only certain way to extract the image and be sure you are seeing an accurate representation\nof the firmware level is to use a tailored hardware tool to read it directly from its chip, which may in turn\nbe encrypted.\n\nThere are other low-level attacks, such as manipulating or replacing hard drive firmware as seen by\nthe Equation Group[36] and System Management Mode (SMM) rootkits as demonstrated by the University\nof Central Florida.[ 37] While there are many examples of these kinds of attacks, many more will inevitably\n\n[27. http://ho.ax/downloads/De_Mysteriis_Dom_Jobsivs_Black_Hat_Paper.pdf - Black Hat paper on attacking the](http://ho.ax/downloads/De_Mysteriis_Dom_Jobsivs_Black_Hat_Paper.pdf)\nEFI layer\n[28. https://www.virusbtn.com/pdf/conference/vb2014/VB2014-RodionovMatrosov.pdf - A history of BIOS bootkits,](https://www.virusbtn.com/pdf/conference/vb2014/VB2014-RodionovMatrosov.pdf)\nthrough the first proof of concept release of DreamBoot\n[29. http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/hacking-team-uses-uefi-bios-rootkit-to-keep-rcs-9-](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/hacking-team-uses-uefi-bios-rootkit-to-keep-rcs-9-agent-in-target-systems/)\n[agent-in-target-systems/ - Trend Micro analysis of Hacking Team UEFI malware in development](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/hacking-team-uses-uefi-bios-rootkit-to-keep-rcs-9-agent-in-target-systems/)\n[30. http://www.intelsecurity.com/advanced-threat-research/ht_uefi_rootkit.html_7142015.html - Intel Security analy­](http://www.intelsecurity.com/advanced-threat-research/ht_uefi_rootkit.html_7142015.html)\nsis of the Hacking Team UEFI malware in development\n[31. https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824987.aspx - Secure Boot for UEFI overview](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824987.aspx)\n[32. http://media.kaspersky.com/en/business-security/Kaspersky_AV_for_UEFI_1.0.pdf - scanning tool that boots](http://media.kaspersky.com/en/business-security/Kaspersky_AV_for_UEFI_1.0.pdf)\nduring the BIOS loading procedure to scan for potential malware in the firmware\n[33. http://blog.virustotal.com/2016/01/putting-spotlight-on-firmware-malware_27.html – VirusTotal blog entry de­](http://blog.virustotal.com/2016/01/putting-spotlight-on-firmware-malware_27.html)\nscribing characterization and profiling of malicious firmware images\n[34. https://github.com/chipsec/chipsec - a hardware analysis tool that can be used to extract the BIOS of a PC.

It is increasingly important for all system admin­\nistrators to keep these kinds of attacks in mind when deploying critical systems. Even if a user’s security\nproduct says nothing is wrong, assurances cannot be made about these lower levels by common utilities.\nAsset owners should isolate heavily mission critical devices, such as ICS control systems, from other\ndevices to the highest extent possible, both over networks and via removable devices, as soon as they go\ninto operation. Ensuring absolute security is an impossible task and adding risk only serves to reduce the\nsystem’s security.\n\n##### 4.3  Remediation for Persistence\n\nWhile Sections 4.1 and 4.2 touch on a number of persistence methods, many more are available to\nmalware authors. Because OSs are extensible, there are many areas of each system for malware to hide\nand wait for execution by a common process. Further, the unconventional methods of persistence, such\nas USB infection and BIOS modification, are single points of vulnerability. As standards in technology\nevolve to accommodate new types of devices, new vulnerabilities will inevitably begin to arise as well.\n\nDefending against persistence is twofold. Strong security to limit the changes on the file system and\nflagging suspicious behavior can hold off many malware persistence methods that rely on the file system\n(see Sections 4.1 and 4.2). However, for unconventional forms of persistence and spreading, it is neces­\nsary to enforce policy changes on which devices the asset owner uses for specific tasks, which systems\nmay have connected devices, and careful sourcing and tracking of devices used on trusted systems.\n\n##### 5. INFECTION VECTORS\n\nAttackers use a number of techniques to get malware onto victim devices, and they have been using\nthese same techniques for many years to great effect. Because of the communication-centric nature of\nthe Internet and modern computing in general, the risk of infection through downloaded software, attach­\nments, and web pages will remain high for years to come, because there is no true mitigation against some\nlevel of implicit trust of devices on the other end of the communication.\n\n##### 5.1   Trojanized Software\n\nTrojanized software is software that a threat actor has infected with malicious code and redistributed.\nThis attack relies on users either not getting the software from the distributor directly, or worse, on the\nvendors becoming compromised themselves, allowing the attacker to modify the application at the source.\nAn infected vendor can have a detrimental effect on its users. If an attack compromises a build system or\nsource code repository, the vender may distribute the software before they detect the compromise. This\nkind of incident occurred in the case of the Havex malware,[ 38] which attackers distributed through a tro­\njanized download on multiple ICS software vendors’ websites.[ 39] Fortunately, the repackaging and redistri­\nbution of packages on third-party hosts is far more common than compromising and altering packages on\nofficial vendor channels.\n\nTrojanized software is a rather simple infection vector. The user intentionally provides the means for\nthe application to install and modify the system by installing the trojanized application in the first place.\nHowever, without centralized software repositories (such as “app stores”), it can become difficult for users\nto find the true source of software, particularly those from smaller developers.\n\nMitigation of trojanized software is, in the general sense, a straightforward problem for corporate\nenvironments. By preventing employees from installing their own new software without going through IT,\nand by having IT source and verify all new applications to be installed for correct distribution sources and\n\n[38. https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-14-176-02A - Havex RAT advisory](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-14-176-02A)\n[39. www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2014-10&post=Full-Disclosure-of-Havex-Trojans - Information on](http://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2014-10&post=Full-Disclosure-of-Havex-Trojans)\nHavex trojanized software\n\n\n-----\n\nhashes, an organization can avoid the vast majority of trojan issues. The organization may accomplish this\nverification through a validation of an application’s digital signature to help prove that the distributor of\nthe software is legitimate. This combined with hash verification provides further assurance that the execut­\nable in question is in fact identical to what the vendor has released. However, digital signing of provided\nexecutables and providing hashes has not become standard practice for every vendor.\n\nFor software from potentially compromised vendors, the issue becomes much more complex. It is\nnecessary for IT administrators to vet carefully all applications on the network before approving for instal­\nlation on trusted devices.\n\n##### 5.2  Phishing\n\nThe technique of phishing to either infect a network and/or gather user credentials is one of the most\npervasive challenges for both personal and corporate networks today, with phishing accounting for 55.28\npercent of email traffic in 2015.[ 40] Attacks revolve around deceiving the user into either opening a file or\nlink embedded in a message (email, instant message, social media post, etc.).\n\nThis form of attack is particularly effective when used in conjunction with personalized information\nabout the user in question, such as their name, interests, accounts, activity, or systems that they regularly\nuse. Attacks using these tailored kinds of messages called as spear phishing. They generally target a single\npool of users such as employees working for a specific company or customers of a particular bank. These\nspear-phishing campaigns can be extremely convincing, and with the rise in information available about\nindividuals on the open web, the potential for carefully crafted fraud is much higher than in the past.\n\nOrganizations can best protect against phishing by blocking suspicious communications with spam\nfilters through policy, and by educating end users. Tailored spear-phishing attacks will defeat spam filters,\ndespite the fact that spam filters have become extraordinarily effective in the past decade. These sorts of\nissues require the education of employees in a corporate environment. Employees must be vigilant and\navoid suspicious-looking links or attachments. If anything seems odd about an email, they should confirm\nwith the sender in person or over the phone or forward the email to their information security officer for\nreview.\n\n##### 5.3  Watering Holes\n\nWatering holes are another technique that attackers use to infect users, particularly when targeting a\ncertain industry. The attacker aims to compromise a web site or shared resource frequently used by the\nemployees of a company or sector, injecting malware into web pages to infect employee computers when\nutilizing the system.\n\nThese attacks can be particularly effective for companies with older or unpatched servers used in­\nternally, though the concept is the same regardless of how the attacker carries it out. Once the attack\ncompromised the servers, the attacker modifies the web pages and resources to load malicious code. This\ncode then reaches the end users who are accessing the resource and potentially infects their system with\nmalware.\n\nThese attacks can be devastating when carried out on a commonly accessed resource such as a home­\npage or time tracking system on the company network. This is because the attacks can lead to a rapid\nand pervasive infection. It is critical to keep internal resources patched, perform monitoring on systems\nregularly, and watch for suspicious modifications to any resources they contain or access. A strong rule to\nkeep in mind is that the asset owner must account for the criticality of the system when considering rules\nfor security.\n\n[40. https://securelist.com/analysis/quarterly-spam-reports/71759/spam-and-phishing-in-q2-of-2015/ - Kaspersky](https://securelist.com/analysis/quarterly-spam-reports/71759/spam-and-phishing-in-q2-of-2015/)\nreport detailing the state of phishing attacks seen in 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 5.4  Malvertising\n\nMalvertising in the current landscape of the Internet is a prime target for malware distribution. Much\nof the Internet is supported through advertisements, which provides a great deal of income to many sites,\nallowing content creators to monetize otherwise unmarketable content. Web sites often base advertisement\nsales on features allotted to the ad itself, page space, and the popularity of their host sites.\n\nA primary difficulty comes with adding features to ads, particularly in the form of active scripts and\ninteractive content. The issue here comes in when a threat actor embeds malicious code into advertise­\nments[41] on well-established and reputable sites, compromising users via an exploit kit from an otherwise\ninnocuous page.\n\nThe growing concern in the last year is malicious advertisements slipping into large mainstream web\npages, such as Forbes, Daily Motion, and MSN.[ 42] Because of the breadth of these kinds of attacks, they\ncan be difficult to mitigate from the perspective of corporate IT. Whitelisting of websites through the fire­\nwall is the most effective means of mitigation for untrusted pages. But trusted pages may still pull content\nfrom ad networks compromised with malicious advertisements and manually whitelisting web sites are\nresource intensive for IT and frustrating for employees with need to access new pages. In some environ­\nments, it may be necessary to utilize tools for script blocking, advertisement filtering, or the techniques\nmentioned for script control and alerts in Section 6.4.\n\nFor high security requirements, a stronger approach is to implement complete network separation\nbetween trusted and untrusted devices. Systems that are trusted on the network sit behind a firewall using\nwhitelisting, blocking JavaScript along with extensions, such as Java or Flash, and with access only to\nknown good pages. Administrators can use a second set of systems for all general browsing that connects\nto a firewall with only a blacklist of known malicious domains. This allows for tighter control of what\ncontent crosses over the local network, while still allowing employees access to the necessary information\nto do their job without blockades from IT policy.\n\n##### 6. DEFENSIVE TACTICS\n\nWith changes in attacker posture and techniques, defenders must continuously adapt their tools and\ntechniques to stay ahead of breaches. This section presents core methodologies to detect malicious activity\non the network and contain infections before they cause extensive damage.\n\n##### 6.1  Monitoring\n\nNetwork traffic and system real-time monitoring is one of the most impactful lines of defense avail­\nable to administrators. Unusual IP connections in and out of the network are often the first hints that some­\nthing out of the ordinary is occurring, while changes on machine file systems outside of the user’s typical\nusage are often the first hard pieces of evidence to indicate a compromise.\n\nMonitoring should be the first active level of defense. Administrators should use tools such as fire­\nwalls, real time malware scanning, network packet inspection, and intrusion detection systems (IDS) at\ningress/egress points on the network to improve knowledge of what is coming in and going out of the\nnetwork. This knowledge is more actionable than finding out a compromise occurred months or years in\nthe past.\n\n[41. http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/youtube-ads-lead-to-exploit-kits-hit-us-victims/ -](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/youtube-ads-lead-to-exploit-kits-hit-us-victims/)\nTrend Micro article detailing ads embedded in YouTube pages that have been directed to a hijacked address contain­\ning malware\n[42. http://www.engadget.com/2016/01/08/you-say-advertising-i-say-block-that-malware/ - Malvertising on trusted,](http://www.engadget.com/2016/01/08/you-say-advertising-i-say-block-that-malware/)\nlarge web sites\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 6.2  Logging\n\nLogging goes hand in hand with monitoring. Ultimately, when an attack occurs and succeeds, it will\nlikely take the victim by surprise, even if the monitoring tools are successful in detecting the malicious\nactivity. Many breaches into networks go undetected for a long period of time before detection. In 2015,\nMandiant found a median of 146 days between breach and detection,[ 43] plenty of time for the attacker to\nhave gathered the information they desired and moved on.\n\nIt is common for attackers to evade the initial detection of monitoring tools, slipping into the system\nthrough an unmonitored avenue such as malicious email attachments or through a misconfigured fire­\nwall rule. These missed detections can leave a network in a state of uncertainty, especially in the case of\ndestructive and information gathering malware. Without logs to determine the time, events, and method­\nology of the initial infection, administrators are left working blindly, trying to retrace the attacker’s steps.\nFailure to remove all entry points that an attacker originally used may lead to the reinfection of the system\nand force the asset owner to perform the entire remediation action again, which is an expensive endeavor.\n\nLogs take many forms and should be set up with the same degree of time and care as the detection\nand monitoring systems were. Network logging at firewalls, file systems, and event logging on servers and\nclients, logs for antivirus scan results, and logs indicating local or remote user login and logout activities\nare some of the more useful information repositories from the perspective of a remediation team. Each\nsecurity incident is unique, but logs provide a solid foundation for investigation and often substantially\nreduce the time taken to evaluate the malware’s trajectory and method of persistence.\n\nAdministrators should treat log files in a similar manner to other valuable data on the system. Backups\nof log files in the event of a data loss may be invaluable for triaging unexpected compromise or system\nfailure, as they allow both analyst and system engineer to troubleshoot and track down the source of both\nintrusions and failures. The organization should determine the duration of logs. The Health Insurance\nPortability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires that transaction data to be kept for 6 years,[ 44] whereas\nDepartment of Defense (DOD) requires that server transition history be retained for 2 years.[ 45] Each indus­\ntry needs to determine its range in the spectrum, keeping in mind that too little will not allow the perspec­\ntive required to see the full picture if an attack slips into the network too quietly and goes unnoticed.\n\n##### 6.3  Preventing and Reducing Network Contamination\n\nWhen an asset owner detects an intrusion, the breadth of the information loss is often difficult or\nimpossible to determine. When the asset owner detects an infection, the devices attached to the infected\nmachine are all at risk, including any information servers or services to which they have had access.\n\nDefense-in-depth strategies will prevent or limit the extent of a compromise to a network from any\nsingle point of intrusion. Once an attacker has exploited a device, a compromised host can traverse a flat\nnetwork as if the attacker was the legitimate user of that system, with full access to Active Directory or\nany other service on the network afforded to them.\n\nDesigning a defense-in-depth network requires an asset owner to design a specific structure into the\nnetwork that separates each level of the connected system from one another, keeping the most critical ma­\nchines as far excluded and protected from the open Internet as possible. ICSCERT recommends achieving\nthis separation through zoning and the implementation of protections to each zone unique to their re­\n\n[43. https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/annual-threat-report/mtrends.html – Mandiant report on the state of](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/annual-threat-report/mtrends.html)\nattacks against corporate environments, with 146 days between breach and detection (page 4)\n[44. http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-66-Rev1/SP-800-66-Revision1.pdf - HIPAA guidelines, log preser­](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-66-Rev1/SP-800-66-Revision1.pdf)\nvation in section 4.22\n[45. https://www.stigviewer.com/stig/web_policy/2011-10-03/finding/V-23844 - DISA STIG guidelines for web serv­](https://www.stigviewer.com/stig/web_policy/2011-10-03/finding/V-23844)\ner access logs\n\n\n-----\n\nquirements.[ 46] The design of each network will be slightly different depending on its requirements, but the\nprinciples of network topology will follow the same pattern of hindering the lateral movement of attackers\nwithin the network.\n\nIt is critical that each system has access only to the devices and files that are required for their opera­\ntion. The concept of a device that can access all elements of the network provides far too much risk to the\nintegrity of the network if as attacker ever compromises the “master” device. It is important for network\ndesigners to keep the principle of least privilege access controls[47] in mind with each device added to the\nnetwork.\n\n##### 6.4  Vulnerability Exploitation\n\nThe ramifications of zero-day attacks can be devastating to large networks and are of critical concern\nto those on sensitive networks; however, the number of attacks that use zero-day exploits is small—less\nthan 0.1 percent of all breaches recorded in 2014.[ 48]\n\nThere are multiple products on the market designed to help those in industry take precautions against\nzero-day attacks.[49] Exploit mitigation software such as Microsoft’s Enhanced Mitigation Experience\nToolkit (EMET), MalwareBytes’ Anti-Exploit, and HitmanPro.Alert attempt to disrupt or prevent common\nexploitation techniques. Preventing execution of scripts using tools, such as NoScript and Privoxy, along\nwith enabling click-to-play plugin functionality within browsers,[ 50] can help prevent exploitation attempts\nand raise user awareness of the execution of scripts on sites.\n\nTechnologies to mitigate these risks include IDS with deep packet inspection, monitoring traffic\nfor unusual beaconing, data-loss prevention systems, regular file system scanning using a tool such as\nYARA,[51] scanning the system with antivirus software, and monitoring for indications of compromise such\nas irregular registry changes.\n\nThis level of prudence, in tandem with frequent patching, greatly increases the chances that an asset\nowner can either completely thwart or quickly identify attacks. However, there is no “silver bullet” solu­\ntion against zero-day exploits, which is part of the reason why attackers value them so highly. Through\ncareful monitoring, however, asset owners can either prevent or identify and expunge many attacks before\nthey cause irrevocable damage.\n\n##### 7. PLATFORM CHALLENGES\n\nEach platform faces its own challenges, making it difficult to respond in the same way for one platform\nas would be appropriate for another. The discrepancy between platforms causes issues with responders having\nthe background for each potential target involved in an incident and could cause IT administration to overlook\na misconfigured device. In essence, each platform is vulnerable to every malware category found on any other\nplatform, but attack vectors are often different depending on the characteristics of the platform in question.\n\n[46. https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)\n[Depth_2016_S508C.pdf - ICS-CERT recommendations for defense-in-depth strategies in network design and](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)\ndeployment\n[47. https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/articles/knowledge/principles/least-privilege - US-CERT Guidelines for least](https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/articles/knowledge/principles/least-privilege)\nprivilege implementation\n[48. https://secunia.com/?action=fetch&filename=secunia_vulnerability_review_2014.pdf - Secunia review of vulner­](https://secunia.com/?action=fetch&filename=secunia_vulnerability_review_2014.pdf)\nability patch availability in 2011 through 2014, page 103\n[49. https://securelist.com/blog/security-policies/71915/indicators-of-compromise-as-a-way-to-reduce-risk/ - Kasper­](https://securelist.com/blog/security-policies/71915/indicators-of-compromise-as-a-way-to-reduce-risk/)\nsky recommendations on monitoring and remediating for compromised systems from both identified and zero-day\ncompromise attacks.\n[50. http://howtogeek.com/188059/how-to-enable-click-to-play-plugins-in-every-web-browser/ - Enable click-to-play](http://howtogeek.com/188059/how-to-enable-click-to-play-plugins-in-every-web-browser/)\nfor scripts inside browsers to prevent users unintentionally executing scripts\n51 htt // i [t t l ith b i /](http://virustotal.github.io/yara/) / YARA fil l i A t l d t f t ti ll li i fil t\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 7.1  PC\n\nThe personal computer (PC) environment, including Windows, Linux and OS X, has evolved over\na long period of time, incorporating a myriad of features for end users over the course of their extensive\ndevelopment. Originally, the designers of all these systems were going for usability rather than security,\nwhich massively extended their user base.\n\nWith a constantly expanding and evolving collection of needs from users across the personal and\ncorporate computing space, vendors have designed these platforms for extensibility, so asset owners can\ntweak and tailor them for as many diverse environments as possible. This functionality has permitted\nmany businesses to thrive on using PC OSs in many environments, from users editing files and accessing\nweb pages to direct control of ICS automation tasks. However, this openness has forced the modern OS to\nexpose a great deal of control and resources to all software running on it, as well as preserve compatibil­\nity with applications that asset owners have uniquely tailored for any number of environments as the OS\nevolves.\n\nThe flexibility of OSs on PCs today has led to many different persistence mechanisms[52] and attack\nvectors for malware to target. The diversity and flexibility of these platforms, which has given them such\nutility, has also resulted in substantial difficulty for the examination of operational systems for compro­\nmise or vulnerabilities in configuration.\n\nBecause of this immense potential for attack, along with the prevalence of PCs across all types of\nenvironments, PCs are by far the most targeted platforms by malware. It is critical to carefully configure\nand monitor for changes in file system, configuration, and network state for each trusted system on the\nnetwork.\n\n###### 7.1.1  Windows\n\nWhile attacks have been on the rise for all OSs, attacks targeting Windows are by far the most wide­\nspread. According to Symantec, 317 million new malware variants appeared in 2014, up from 252 million\nnew variants in 2013.[ 53] The staggering number of malware samples is a direct correlation to the number\nof users available for the attacker to target. The incentive for the vast majority of attackers is the cash flow\ngenerated by infecting victims with crimeware, such as distributing ransomware or serving paid advertise­\nments, to victims through successful infections.\n\nAnother core concern for operational environments running Windows is the impact of more common\ncommodity and criminal malware that could disrupt operations. This is of a particular concern to ICS/\nSCADA systems, because a single piece of untargeted malware, such as CryptoLocker, could put a Win­\ndows-powered HMI out of commission just as effectively as a PC.\n\nWindows users must take particular care to keep up with updates both to the OS and individual\nsoftware installed on their devices. Further, up-to-date antivirus and good system hygiene (avoiding\nadministrator accounts, configuration of software firewall, application whitelisting, etc.) is of particular\nimportance to protecting Windows machines. With the large numbers of attackers eyeing the platform, it is\nimportant to keep the system hardened against those seeking to utilize vulnerabilities, both new and old.\n\n[52. https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Wipe+the+drive+Stealthy+Malware+Persistence+Mechanism+-+Part+1/15394 - Exam­](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Wipe+the+drive+Stealthy+Malware+Persistence+Mechanism+-+Part+1/15394)\nples of persistence establishment in Windows through less common features of the operating system\n[53. https://www4.symantec.com/mtginfo/whitepaper/ISTR/21347923_GA-internet-security-threat-report-vol­](https://www4.symantec.com/mtginfo/whitepaper/ISTR/21347923_GA-internet-security-threat-report-volume-20-2015-social_v2.pdf)\n[ume-20-2015-social_v2.pdf - Symantec ISTR 2015, Page 90 discusses new malware variants between 2013 and](https://www4.symantec.com/mtginfo/whitepaper/ISTR/21347923_GA-internet-security-threat-report-volume-20-2015-social_v2.pdf)\n2014\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 7.1.2  OS X\n\nOS X has only recently seen its first substantial number of malware attacks in the past 4 years.[ 54] This\nis in part due to both core system differences with Windows devices, as well as what is still a compara­\ntively burgeoning user base. In recent years, the number of users who are changing platforms to OS X has\nincreased the allure of the platform for malware authors.\n\nDriven by the increase in the number of users for the OS X ecosystem, malware authors have adapted\nthe same tactics used against Windows to the OS X ecosystem. While the infection vectors and vulner­\nabilities are often different from Windows devices, the ultimate goal is the same. OS X users are slowly\nadapting the same tactics for malware design from botnets[55] to ransomware.[ 56] Many creators have tailored\ntheir new attacks to work along with the same existing infrastructure as the current Windows malware, al­\nlowing structures, such as botnets, to work cross platform for larger scale DDoS attacks or bitcoin mining.\n\nOS X users must take care not to underestimate security of their systems. It is currently less common\nto find OS X malware than Windows malware, and the application model employed by OS X will make\nporting existing malware to the new platform difficult. However, with increasing numbers of users and a\ndifferent target audience than the other platforms, there is substantial incentive for attackers to continue\ntheir increased focus on OS X going forward.\n\nGood practice for security of OS X devices on your network is very similar to Windows. IT admin­\nistrators should use AV for detection of malware on the device, even if it is less common. Kaspersky labs\nreported that threat actors targeted the average Mac user nine times during the course of 2014,[57] show­\ning that the number of attacks, while not extreme, is nonetheless significant. Keep in mind that only one\nsuccessful attack is necessary to compromise a device. Keeping systems up to date, scanning for malicious\nsoftware, and taking care with application installation and machine configuration will help to mitigate the\nincreasing risk of attack.\n\n###### 7.1.3  Linux\n\nLinux has firmly secured its place in a massive variety of locations, from a host of embedded devic­\nes to supercomputers and smartphones to servers. Profiling Linux, as such, can be much more difficult,\nbecause the number of differing distributions is massive. Because of the nature of Linux as an open source\nplatform, it is impossible to determine definitively the total number of distributions at any given time, but\nDistroWatch.com tracks 804 distinct distributions as of November 2015, a number that grows constantly.[ 58]\n\nAttackers going after Linux machines are often targeting devices with specific hardware, software, or\nconfigurations rather than seeking out large-scale infection on any machine. Attacks against servers have\nbeen seen as extraordinarily effective, such as the New China botnet attack[59]—a piece of malware that in­\nfects Linux devices and uses them as large-scale DDoS machines. In this situation, a single-owned server\n\n[54. https://eugene.kaspersky.com/2014/09/29/the-evolution-of-os-x-malware/ - Article detailing the early ages and](https://eugene.kaspersky.com/2014/09/29/the-evolution-of-os-x-malware/)\nprogress of OS X malware\n[55. https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/32661/flashfake-mac-os-x-botnet-confirmed-25 - Botnet targeting OS X](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/32661/flashfake-mac-os-x-botnet-confirmed-25)\n[56. https://blog.malwarebytes.org/fraud-scam/2013/07/fbi-ransomware-now-targeting-apples-mac-os-x-users/ - Ran­](https://blog.malwarebytes.org/fraud-scam/2013/07/fbi-ransomware-now-targeting-apples-mac-os-x-users/)\nsomware targeting the OS X platform\n[57. https://securelist.com/analysis/kaspersky-security-bulletin/68010/kaspersky-security-bulletin-2014-overall-statis­](https://securelist.com/analysis/kaspersky-security-bulletin/68010/kaspersky-security-bulletin-2014-overall-statistics-for-2014/)\n[tics-for-2014/ - Kaspersky 2014 year in review, detailing OS X attacks encountered by observed users](https://securelist.com/analysis/kaspersky-security-bulletin/68010/kaspersky-security-bulletin-2014-overall-statistics-for-2014/)\n[58. http://distrowatch.com/search.php?status=All - Collection of Linux distributions tracked by DistroWatch.com](http://distrowatch.com/search.php?status=All)\n[59. http://blog.malwaremustdie.org/2014/09/mmd-0028-2014-fuzzy-reversing-new-china.html - Malware analysis on](http://blog.malwaremustdie.org/2014/09/mmd-0028-2014-fuzzy-reversing-new-china.html)\nNew China Botnet\n\n\n-----\n\nof reasonable quality with the malware is able to output massive DDoS attacks because of the server’s\noften high level of network throughput, outclassing the potency of traffic that could be generated by more\ncompromised individual machines.[ 60,61]\n\nBecause the desktop user base of Linux has remained relatively small compared to both Windows and\nOS X, attacks on the platform can be hard to track down, hard to profile, and come into the spotlight of\nmalware analysts slowly. However, because of a lack of interest from the consumers, many anti-malware\ncompanies have focused more on Windows and OS X. It has become more difficult to remediate malware\non Linux than other platforms because of the lack of detection mechanisms.\n\nLinux users must take the time to carefully configure their device, take care with the packages they\nchoose to install, and watch for unexpected application or script behavior. While attacks targeting Linux\nare less common, having a false sense of platform security results in less vigilant security on the part of\nthe users. In recent years, there have been major vulnerabilities in active use for Linux, including Heart­\nbleed[62] and Shellshock.[63] Each of these vulnerabilities was remotely exploitable and posed major risk to\nusers of Linux platforms. The malware risks and techniques employed against Linux targets closely mirror\nthose used against other platforms, such as ransomware[64] and remote access trojans.[65] While uncommon,\nLinux malware has become more popular in recent years because of the heavy reliance on the platform\nacross a great number of devices, and it is continuing to grow.[ 66]\n\n##### 7.2  Mobile\n\nMobile devices and the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) movement as a whole pose a security risk to\nboth individual privacy and organizational integrity. It is has become commonplace to use mobile devices\nto access a plethora of services, both within company intranet and the public Internet, bringing a wealth of\ninformation onto these relatively new platforms. Further, ownership of these devices is quickly becoming\nubiquitous across the country, with 64 percent of American adults owning smartphones as of April 2015\ncompared to 35 percent in 2011.[ 67] These devices are providing an extensive amount of personal and cor­\nporate information conveniently located in one place—for both the user as well as the attacker.\n\nFrom the perspective of many attackers, compromise of these devices is likely as valuable as PCs,\nif not more so. The value of a device for many attackers is in what information they can gather from it,\nas well as the network devices to which it can connect. Many users of smartphones store an incredible\namount of personal information on their devices, accessing services such as workplace and personal\nemail, online banking, and social media.\n\nFurther muddling the issue surrounding the value of a compromised mobile device, key assets are not\nalways easy to identify from the applications on the device alone. As an example, many services allow\nusers to utilize two-factor authentication by sending a second authentication code via text message or mo­\n\n[60. http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/09/botnet-preying-on-linux-computers-delivers-potent-ddos-attacks - Article](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/09/botnet-preying-on-linux-computers-delivers-potent-ddos-attacks)\ndetailing the strength of DDoS attacks from Linux servers from the Linux/Xor.DDoS attack\n[61. https://bartblaze.blogspot.com/2015/09/notes-on-linuxxorddos.html - article detailing the Linux/Xor malware](https://bartblaze.blogspot.com/2015/09/notes-on-linuxxorddos.html)\n[62. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2663755 - The Matter of Heartbleed, ACM - discussion of the Heartbleed vul­](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2663755)\nnerability and consequences\n[63. https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/shellshock-all-you-need-know-about-bash-bug-vulnerability - Syman­](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/shellshock-all-you-need-know-about-bash-bug-vulnerability)\ntec overview of the shellshock vulnerability and consequences\n[64. http://blog.checkpoint.com/2015/04/20/analyzing-magento-vulnerability/ - Analysis of magneto ransomware](http://blog.checkpoint.com/2015/04/20/analyzing-magento-vulnerability/)\ntargeting linux users\n[65. https://threatpost.com/new-evasion-techniques-help-alienspy-rat-spread-citadel-malware/112064 - Kaspersky](https://threatpost.com/new-evasion-techniques-help-alienspy-rat-spread-citadel-malware/112064)\nanalysis of AlienRAT, a remote access trojan targeting a wide variety of platforms\n[66. http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/01/13/really-need-antivirus-software-linux-desktops/ - Evolution of Linux](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/01/13/really-need-antivirus-software-linux-desktops/)\nmalware\n[67. www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/ - US smartphone usage statistics](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/)\n\n\n-----\n\npp g, j p, p y g y\ntaking one factor (something you know—your password) and adding another (something you have—your\nphone). This increased level of security is useless if the attacker is able to compromise the mobile device\nbecause both pieces of information pass through the same medium. This particular case makes the mo­\nbile device a more attractive target to an attacker than the victim’s PC, because one device yields all the\nrequired credentials.\n\nFrom an operational security perspective, the comparison of mobile to traditional desktop/laptop\nOSs is a mixed bag. On one hand, modern mobile OSs, such as Android and iPhone OS (iOS), have had\na higher degree of security since their inception than have their PC counterparts. Both Google and Apple\nheavily monitor their application stores for malicious applications and remove developers who repeatedly\nput their customers at risk. Furthermore, the systems themselves impose heavier constraints on running\napplications and utilize sandboxing along with other techniques to prevent many forms of malware from\neasily executing on the system without the user knowing. As a result, exploits are less common, particular­\nly when the user installs only officially sanctioned applications.[ 69]\n\nHowever, one core issue with the transition to mobile OSs is that they are still young and evolving\necosystems and not fully tested by the information security and malware research communities. Because\nof the short time in which these devices have been commonly in use, there has only recently been a large\nenough user-base to incentivize malware authors to target them and researchers to examine the attack\nsurface.\n\nJust as OS X has started to see a rise in malware through recent years, Android and iOS have also\nrecently seen an increase in attention from malware developers. Security, malware, and forensic analysis\non these devices will become an increasing concern for researchers over the coming years as the potential\ngain for attackers continues to grow.\n\nWhen employing mobile devices in the corporate setting, administrators need to treat these devices\nsimilar to laptops. Asset owners must monitor all devices used between networks and exposed to the open\nweb for malware and should not trust such devices in information-sensitive environments.\n\n##### 7.3  Internet of Things\n\nAs devices connecting to the Internet become ubiquitous, the concern of the malware community\nturns to the new risks that the compromise of these devices poses. Advancement in technology is often\nmoving at a faster pace than security, because getting to market is often the primary concern of new tech­\nnology. This can potentially leave customer data (and, in the case of automated tools, privacy or safety) at\nrisk.\n\nThe acceleration of new types of devices connecting to the Internet is higher than ever, increasing the\npotential for the infection of new and emerging technology and making it a greater concern in areas out­\nside the realm of conventional computing devices. Smart appliances, home security systems, closed-cir­\ncuit televisions, vehicles, and public transportation are all consistently pushing for further automation and\nconnectivity and are becoming accessible through the Internet. These changes are adding convenience and\nnew features, but are also increasing the attack surface and drastically changing the security perimeter.\n\n[68. https://securelist.com/blog/research/73211/the-asacub-trojan-from-spyware-to-banking-malware - Asacub mal­](https://securelist.com/blog/research/73211/the-asacub-trojan-from-spyware-to-banking-malware)\nware focused on stealing multifactor authentication from Android banking applications\n[69. https://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030743/Threat_report_H2_2013.pdf - Mobile malware statistics](https://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030743/Threat_report_H2_2013.pdf)\nbased on software download location\n\n\n-----\n\ntaking control of a car while it was in motion on the highway,[ 70] modifying smart watches,[ 71] and inter­\ncepting baby monitor transmissions.[ 72] With such a wide array of newly emerging technology, there will\nneed to be significant research taking place on both the defensive and offensive sides before we know how\nthese devices will ultimately fit into our lives and what it will reasonably take to secure them.\n\nLooking outside of the scope of personal devices, point-of-sale devices and ATMs are communicating\nthrough the Internet to establish connections to financial institutions and private money-transfer corpora­\ntions. This mirrors the concerns of home devices with the primary difference being the type of information\nexfiltrated in a compromise.\n\n##### 7.4  ICS\n\nSince the discovery of Stuxnet, a widespread emergence of interest has come from highly sophisticat­\ned actors: intelligence gathering and potential attacks targeting ICS environments. Two malware families,\nHavex and BlackEnergy 2, were observed specifically targeting ICSs. Both make use of a modular archi­\ntecture allowing for extended functionality with plugins.\n\nHavex (also known as Energetic Bear, Crouching Yeti, and Dragonfly, among others) is a RAT (re­\nmote-access trojan) that initially targeted the Energy Sector in early 2014. Two observed plugins actively\ncollect information about connected ICS devices by scanning for several commonly-used ICS protocol\nports and interrogating any available Open Platform Communications servers for information. Havex has\nbeen spotted in a variety of critical infrastructure sectors, including Chemical, Energy, and, more recently,\nthe pharmaceutical industry,[ 73] throughout various countries.\n\nIntelligence gathering on the affected systems appears to be the underlying goal of Havex, rather than\ndirectly controlling any connected control systems. This indicates that the current goal for its creators is\nto steal information about the system’s configuration, possibly in anticipation of an attack scenario, or pos­\nsibly related to corporate intellectual property.\n\nBlackEnergy is an interesting case of malware that has undergone a dramatic change in its design and\ntarget depending on the groups that use it. Initially, BlackEnergy was a DDoS bot primarily used by the\nRussian hacker underground to take down sites. Support for plugins was added in the next major revision\n(BlackEnergy2),[ 74] changing the exclusively DDoS box into a powerful multi-tool. Years later, researchers\ndiscovered that threat actors utilized zero-day exploits and spear phishing, combined with BlackEnergy 2\nand specially-tailored plugins, to target and compromise ICS networks.\n\nThreat actors have also found methods of avoiding detection from firewall services through the\nexploitation of third parties. BlackEnergy 2 included functionality for fetching configuration from\nthird-party sites that are otherwise not malicious but are exposed to the public (such as Google Plus). This\nadvancement may have helped to keep the malware authors “under the radar” until recently while execut­\ning the campaign. In addition, a Linux variant of BlackEnergy2 targeting ARM and MIPS[75] platforms has\nbeen seen in the wild—something that is uncommon for malware. New techniques to embed their com­\nmunication software into internal company routers through backdoors and zero-day exploits has greatly\nexpanded their capability to penetrate and potential to persist in both corporate and ICS networks.\n\n[70. www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway - Proof of concept attack against a vehicle’s con­](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway)\nnected systems\n[71. https://securelist.com/blog/research/69369/how-i-hacked-my-smart-bracelet - Research into the pairing and](https://securelist.com/blog/research/69369/how-i-hacked-my-smart-bracelet)\nauthentication mechinisms of smart wearable devices.\n[72. https://www.rapid7.com/docs/Hacking-IoT-A-Case-Study-on-Baby-Monitor-Exposures-and-Vulnerabilities.pdf -](https://www.rapid7.com/docs/Hacking-IoT-A-Case-Study-on-Baby-Monitor-Exposures-and-Vulnerabilities.pdf)\nCase study on Internet of Things devices\n[73. www.blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/64-bit-version-of-havex-spotted - Details new variants](http://www.blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/64-bit-version-of-havex-spotted)\nof Havex, its targeting trajectory, and method of operation\n[74. https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-14-281-01B - ICS-CERT alert for BlackEnergy 2](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-14-281-01B)\n[75. https://securelist.com/blog/research/67252/be2-custom-plugins-router-abuse-and-target-profiles/ - Kaspersky](https://securelist.com/blog/research/67252/be2-custom-plugins-router-abuse-and-target-profiles/)\n\nd ili l k l f\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth Havex and BlackEnergy show a high-degree of sophisticated design and careful construction,\nleading researchers to believe that they are being maintained by a team of developers, expanding their\ncapabilities and advancement in a way that has drawn a great deal of attention from researchers. Attacks\nfrom the BlackEnergy family are still ongoing, with attackers using a variant of BlackEnergy 3 against the\ncorporate network of a power facility as recently as December 2015.[ 76]\n\nThreats to ICS systems are a growing area of research for both attackers and defenders. With continu­\ning threats and discovery of vulnerabilities in this area, it will remain a high profile topic in the security\nfield going forward due to the potential impact of a breach.\n\n##### 8. CONCLUSION\n\nThe malware landscape has grown in parallel with software and emerging technology, adapting new\ntechniques and strategies from industry into their design paradigms and targeting new platforms as they\npresent lucrative opportunity for attackers. The inherent cat and mouse game between malware authors\nand vendors that has existed for years with no sign of stopping.\n\nAdministrators across all industries need to protect their devices from malware attacks, focusing their\nefforts on keeping device OSs and security software up to date and hardening their infrastructure against\nopen vectors of attack. The threat of data breaches continues to rise, but infrastructure security solutions\nare evolving and adapting as well. Staying involved with the state of malware, new patches, and security\nadvancements helps to keep network defenders aware of any new challenges they may face. Knowledge\nof the landscape of the network, along with awareness of the new and emerging threats, allows adminis­\ntrators to take the steps they need when dealing with attacks against their networks.\n\nICS-CERT publishes vulnerability updates and malware analysis reports for customers in the ICS in­\ndustry through the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN).[77] Regular alerts[78] and advisories[79] are\navailable to aid in the protection of critical devices, allowing administrators and users to take timely action\nwhen new vulnerabilities arise. ICS-CERT publishes best practices[80] for security configurations to aid in\nthe protection of assets before a compromise has occurred. Each malware family that poses a threat to ICS\nsystems goes through analysis in order to provide remediation techniques and with malware detection sig­\nnatures. This helps asset owners detect malicious software on their networks and defend against attacks.\n[For updates and analysis on the most current threats facing ICS, visit https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov.](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov)\n\n[76. https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/IR-ALERT-H-16-056-01 - ICS-CERT alert for BlackEnergy 3 discovery within](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/IR-ALERT-H-16-056-01)\nan ICS environment\n77.
