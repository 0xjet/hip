Victim organizations included a United States-based affiliate of a\nsignificant United Kingdom-based telecommunications provider and a South African\ntelecommunications provider. Insikt Group attributes this activity to the Chinese state-sponsored threat\nactivity group tracked by Insikt Group as RedMike, which aligns with the Microsoft-named group Salt\nTyphoon. Using Recorded Future® Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed RedMike target and\nexploit unpatched Cisco network devices vulnerable to CVE-2023-20198, a privilege escalation\nvulnerability found in the web user interface (UI) feature in Cisco IOS XE software, for initial access\nbefore exploiting an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root\nprivileges. RedMike reconfigures the device, adding a generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel for\npersistent access.\n\nRedMike has attempted to exploit more than 1,000 Cisco devices globally. The group likely compiled a\nlist of target devices based on their association with telecommunications providers' networks. Insikt\nGroup also observed RedMike targeting devices associated with universities in Argentina, Bangladesh,\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the United States (US), and Vietnam. RedMike\npossibly targeted these universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications,\nengineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like UCLA and TU Delft. In addition to this\nactivity, in mid-December 2024, RedMike also carried out a reconnaissance of multiple IP addresses\nowned by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel.\n\nUnpatched public-facing appliances serve as direct entry points into an organization’s infrastructure.\n[Sophisticated Chinese threat activity groups have shifted](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf) heavily toward exploiting these devices for\ninitial access over the past five years. RedMike’s exploitation of telecommunications infrastructure goes\nbeyond technical vulnerabilities and represents a strategic intelligence threat. Persistent access to\ncritical communications networks enables state-backed threat actors to monitor confidential\nconversations, manipulate data flows, and disrupt services during geopolitical conflicts. RedMike’s\ntargeting of lawful intercept programs and US political figures highlights the strategic intelligence\nobjectives behind these operations and the national security threat they pose.\n\nOrganizations, particularly those in the telecommunications industry, must prioritize remediating\nexposed network devices, as unpatched systems remain a key initial access vector for Chinese\nstate-sponsored threat activity groups. Network administrators should implement strict access controls,\ndisable unnecessary web UI exposure, and monitor for unauthorized configuration changes. Individuals\nshould use end-to-end encrypted communication methods for sensitive information, just as the\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nrecommended, which is crucial to mitigate potential eavesdropping risks.\n\n1 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ CTA-CN-2025-0213 ​ ​ [Recorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, governments and cybersecurity entities should improve threat intelligence sharing and\nimpose stricter regulatory compliance for network security. While the US sanctions on\nRedMike-affiliated Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology signal a more assertive and commendable\nstance against state-backed cyber espionage in critical infrastructure, robust international cooperation\nis crucial for effectively countering these persistent threats.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n  - Despite significant media coverage and US sanctions, RedMike continues to compromise\n\ntelecommunications providers globally, including in the US.\n\n  - RedMike compromised Cisco network devices of a US-based affiliate of a United Kingdom (UK)\n\ntelecommunications provider and a primary South African telecommunications provider.\n\n  - RedMike exploited privilege escalation vulnerabilities CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273 to\n\ncompromise unpatched Cisco network devices running Cisco IOS XE software.\n\n  - Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified RedMike attempting to\n\nexploit over 1,000 Cisco network devices between December 2024 and January 2025.\n\n## Background\n\n[In late September 2024, media reporting (1, 2) stated that the Chinese state-sponsored group Salt](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/china-cyberattack-internet-providers-260bd835?st=cYA8J5&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)\nTyphoon had compromised the networks of major US telecommunications companies, including\n[Verizon (1), AT&T, and Lumen Technologies. The activity likely affected telecommunications](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-provides-update-salt-typhoon-matter)\n[organizations globally, with some outlets reporting that Salt Typhoon compromised at least 80](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2024/12/12/we-need-to-talk-about-salt-typhoon-00183727)\n[organizations. SaltTyphoon used its access to telecommunications providers to snoop on US lawful](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/salt-typhoon-apt-subverts-law-enforcement-wiretapping)\n[intercept targets and intercept](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/salt-typhoon-apt-subverts-law-enforcement-wiretapping) the communications of significant US political figures. The effect of Salt\nTyphoon’s intrusions has reached the highest levels of the US government: Cybersecurity experts have\n[briefed](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-agencies-brief-senators-chinese-salt-typhoon-telecom-hacking-2024-12-04/) the US Senate, CISA recently [issued](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure) guidance on hardening telecommunications infrastructure,\nand CISA and the FBI issued a joint [warning encouraging the use of encrypted end-to-end messaging](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/12/06/fbi-warns-iphone-and-android-users-stop-sending-texts/)\napplications for sensitive communications.\n\nInsikt Group tracks Salt Typhoon-aligned activity as RedMike. Salt Typhoon is a group name given by\nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence; at this time, Microsoft has not published publicly available technical\ndetails of the group's activity. The only public information Microsoft has shared confirms an [overlap](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/microsoft-threat-actor-naming)\n[with two existing threat activity group names: GhostEmperor (Kaspersky) and FamousSparrow (ESET).](https://securelist.com/ghostemperor-from-proxylogon-to-kernel-mode/104407/)\n\nOn January 17, 2025, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\n[sanctioned Sichuan-based cybersecurity company Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. for](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2792)\ntheir direct involvement with RedMike activity. OFAC stated that Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology\nCo., Ltd. had direct involvement in exploiting US telecommunications and internet service provider\ncompanies. According to OFAC, China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) has maintained strong ties with\nmultiple computer network exploitation companies, including Sichuan Juxinhe.\n\n2 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ CTA-CN-2025-0213 ​ ​ [Recorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n#### Cisco IOS XE Web UI Exploitation\n\nUsing Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified that since early December 2024,\nRedMike has attempted to exploit over 1,000 internet-facing Cisco network devices worldwide, primarily\nthose associated with telecommunications providers, using a combination of two privilege escalation\nvulnerabilities: CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273. When successfully compromised, the group\nuses the new privileged user account to change the device's configuration and adds a GRE tunnel for\npersistent access and data exfiltration.\n\nThe privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-20198 was found in the Cisco IOS XE software web UI\nfeature, version sixteen and earlier, and [published by Cisco in October 2023. Attackers exploit this](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-webui-privesc-j22SaA4z)\nvulnerability to gain initial access to the device and issue a privilege 15 command to create a local\nuser and password. Following this, the attacker uses the new local account to access the device and\nexploits an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root user privileges.\n\n**_Figure 1: RedMike Cisco network device exploitation infrastructure (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\n3 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ CTA-CN-2025-0213 ​ ​ [Recorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nMore than half of the Cisco devices targeted by RedMike were in the US, South America, and India. The\nremaining devices spanned over 100 other countries. Although the selected devices are primarily\nassociated with telecommunications providers, thirteen were linked to universities across Argentina,\nBangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam.\n\nOften involved in cutting-edge research, universities are prime targets for Chinese state-sponsored\nthreat activity groups to acquire valuable research data and intellectual property. Previous examples\ninclude APT40, which has [targeted](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-200a) universities for biomedical, robotics, and maritime research; RedGolf\n(APT41) [for](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer) [medical research; and RedBravo (APT31), which has directly targeted academics. China’s](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/apt31-chinese-hacking-group-behind-global-cyberespionage-campaign-2024-03-26/)\ncyber strategy [aligns](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf) with its broader economic and military goals, making universities high-value\ntargets for long-term intelligence-gathering and technology acquisition.\n\nRedMike possibly targeted the following universities to access research in areas related to\ntelecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like [UCLA](https://wireless.ee.ucla.edu/research/) and [TU Delft.](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/ee/msc-electrical-engineering/track-wireless-communication-and-sensing/related-research/)\n\n  - University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) — US\n\n  - California State University, Office of the Chancellor (CENIC) — US\n\n  - Loyola Marymount University — US\n\n  - Utah Tech University — US\n\n  - Universidad de La Punta — Argentina\n\n  - Islamic University of Technology (IUT) — Bangladesh\n\n  - Universitas Sebelas Maret — Indonesia\n\n  - Universitas Negeri Malang — Indonesia\n\n  - University of Malaya — Malaysia\n\n  - Universidad Nacional Autonoma — Mexico\n\n  - Technische Universiteit Delft — The Netherlands\n\n  - Sripatum University — Thailand\n\n  - University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City — Vietnam\n\n4 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ CTA-CN-2025-0213 ​ ​ [Recorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: Geographical spread of Cisco devices targeted by RedMike (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\nRedMike’s scanning and exploitation activity occurred on six different occasions from December 2024\nto January 2025.\n\n     - 2024-12-04     - 2024-12-24\n\n     - 2024-12-10     - 2025-01-13\n\n     - 2024-12-17     - 2025-01-23\n\nNetwork administrators operating a Cisco network device with IOS XE software web UI exposed to the\ninternet can use the dates mentioned and advice in the mitigations section to identify potential RedMike\nexploitation activity.\n\nUsing internet scanning data, Insikt Group identified more than 12,000 Cisco network devices with their\nweb UIs exposed to the internet. Although over 1,000 Cisco devices were targeted, Insikt Group\nassesses that this activity was likely focussed, given that this number only represents 8% of the\nexposed devices and that RedMike engaged in periodic reconnaissance activity, selecting devices\nlinked to telecommunications providers.\n\n#### Compromised Telecommunications Provider Devices\n\nUsing Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed seven compromised Cisco network\ndevices communicating with RedMike infrastructure. These include devices associated with:\n\n  - A US-based affiliate of a UK telecommunications provider\n\n5 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ CTA-CN-2025-0213 ​ ​ [Recorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n  - A US internet service provider (ISP) and telecommunications company\n\n  - A South African telecommunications provider\n\n  - An Italian ISP\n\n  - A large Thailand telecommunications provider\n\nRedMike configured GRE tunnels between the compromised Cisco devices and their infrastructure. GRE\nis a tunneling protocol used to encapsulate various network layer protocols inside point-to-point\nconnections. It is a standard feature that can be configured on Cisco network devices. It is commonly\nused to create virtual private networks (VPNs), enable interoperability between different network types,\nand transport multicast or non-IP traffic over IP networks. Threat activity groups use GRE tunnels to\nmaintain persistence by establishing covert communication channels that bypass firewalls and intrusion\ndetection systems. These tunnels also facilitate stealthy data exfiltration by encapsulating stolen data\nwithin GRE packets, potentially bypassing network monitoring.\n\n#### Reconnaissance of Myanmar Telecommunications Provider\n\nIn mid-December 2024, RedMike, from the same infrastructure that exploited the Cisco network\ndevices, performed reconnaissance against multiple infrastructure assets operated by a\nMyanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel, likely including their corporate mail server.\n\n## Mitigations\n\n  - Prioritize applying available security patches and updates to network devices exposed to the\n\ninternet.\n\n  - Avoid exposing administration interfaces or non-essential services on public-facing appliances\n\ndirectly to the internet, particularly for end-of-life devices.\n\n  - Monitor for network device configuration changes.\n\n  - Monitor network traffic for protocols not implemented in your network, such as GRE.\n\n  - Use the advanced query feature in Recorded Future to monitor for actively exploited technology\n\nwithin your stack and set alerts to notify you of any at-risk assets.\n\n#### Cisco IOS XE Software Device-Specific Remediation\n\n[●​ Check system logs for the presence of any of the following log messages where the user could](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-webui-privesc-j22SaA4z)\n\nbe cisco_tac_admin, cisco_support, or any configured local user that is unknown to the\nnetwork administrator:\n\n    - %SYS-5-CONFIG_P: Configured programmatically by process\n```\n       SEP_webui_wsma_http from console as user on line\n\n```\n    - %SEC_LOGIN-5-WEBLOGIN_SUCCESS: Login Success [user: user] [Source:\n```\n       source_IP_address] at 03:42:13 UTC Wed Oct 11 2023\n\n```\n6 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ CTA-CN-2025-0213 ​ ​ [Recorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Outlook\n\nDespite significant media coverage and US sanctions, Insikt Group expects RedMike to continue\ntargeting telecommunications providers in the US and globally due to the amount and high value of\ncommunications data that traverses these networks. This is highlighted by RedMike’s previous targeting\nof US lawful intercept operations and the communications of significant US political figures via these\nintrusions.\n\nWhile espionage operations are not intended to disrupt their target networks, the discovery of such a\nwide-ranging infiltration of US critical infrastructure has further degraded US-China relations,\nevidenced, for example, by the Biden administration [banning China Telecom's remaining operations in](https://web.archive.org/web/20241227060307/https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/us/politics/biden-administration-retaliation-china-hack.html)\nthe US. The US Congress has primarily focused on the security lapses at the telecommunications\n[companies themselves, such as the presence of outdated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/21/salt-typhoon-china-hack-telecom/) [routers and a lack](https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2024/11/white-house-convened-telecom-leaders-details-chinese-espionage-hack-unfold/401277/?oref=ng-homepage-river#:~:text=Many%20of%20the%20breached%20systems%20were%20not%20properly%20equipped%20with%20logging%20mechanisms%20to%20monitor%20device%20activity%2C%20delaying%20investigators%E2%80%99%20attempts%20to%20piece%20together%20the%20digital%20sequencing%20that%20allowed%20the%20campaign%20to%20be%20carried%20out%2C%20the%20person%20added.) of monitoring capabilities,\nas exemplified by the activity observed by Insikt Group.\n\nUS [sanctions on the entity behind RedMike’s activity — Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd.](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2792)\n— followed in early 2025, most likely further straining US-China relations. In this case, the timeline of\npunitive action by the US government was almost certainly accelerated by the forthcoming change in\nadministration compared with previous actions against Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups,\n[which often take longer to become public (1, 2, 3). As the telecommunications industry and intelligence](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-hackers-associated-chinese-government-charged-computer-intrusions-targeting-perceived)\ncommunities begin to grasp the scale of RedMike’s intrusions and tackle the root causes, Insikt Group\nexpects to see further technical details published.\n\n7 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ CTA-CN-2025-0213 ​ ​ [Recorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix A: MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n\n##### Tactic: Technique ATT&CK Code Observable\n\n**Initial Access: Exploit Public-Facing** [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/) RedMike has exploited Cisco network\nApplication devices using CVE-2023-20198 for initial\n\naccess.\n\n**Privilege Escalation: Exploitation for** [T1068](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/) RedMike has exploited Cisco network\nPrivilege Escalation devices using CVE-2023-20273 to gain\n\nroot-level user privileges.\n\n**Command-and-Control: Protocol** [T1572](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572/) RedMike has configured GRE tunnels\nTunneling between compromised Cisco network\n\ndevices and attacker infrastructure.\n\n**Reconnaissance: Gather Victim** [T1590](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1590/) RedMike undertook a reconnaissance of\nNetwork Information Myanmar-based telecommunications\n\nprovider infrastructure.\n\n**Reconnaissance: Active Scanning** [T1595](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/) RedMike has actively scanned 1,000s of\n\nCisco network devices, attempting to\nexploit them with a combination of\nCVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273.\n\n8 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ CTA-CN-2025-0213 ​ ​ [Recorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n|Tactic: Technique|ATT&CK Code|Observable|\n|---|---|---|\n|Initial Access: Exploit Public-Facing Application|T1190|RedMike has exploited Cisco network devices using CVE-2023-20198 for initial access.|\n|Privilege Escalation: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation|T1068|RedMike has exploited Cisco network devices using CVE-2023-20273 to gain root-level user privileges.|\n|Command-and-Control: Protocol Tunneling|T1572|RedMike has configured GRE tunnels between compromised Cisco network devices and attacker infrastructure.|\n|Reconnaissance: Gather Victim Network Information|T1590|RedMike undertook a reconnaissance of Myanmar-based telecommunications provider infrastructure.|\n|Reconnaissance: Active Scanning|T1595|RedMike has actively scanned 1,000s of Cisco network devices, attempting to exploit them with a combination of CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273.|\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix B: RedMike Diamond Model\n\n9 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ CTA-CN-2025-0213 ​ ​ [Recorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Recorded Future reporting contains expressions of likelihood or probability consistent_\n_with US Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 203:_ _[Analytic Standards](https://irp.fas.org/dni/icd/icd-203.pdf)_ _(published_\n_January 2, 2015).
