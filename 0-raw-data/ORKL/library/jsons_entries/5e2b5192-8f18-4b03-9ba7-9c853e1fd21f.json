The hackers promise to give the victim their files back as long as they fork over the\ncryptocurrency—typically Bitcoin—within the stipulated time limit. Now, someone has added\na new, perverse twist to [this tried and tested scheme: demanding naked photographs instead](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/topic/ransomware)\nof Bitcoin.\n\n[Researchers at MalwareHunterTeam, a research group focused on ransomware, spotted the](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\nsoftware, called nRansomware on Thursday. The group posted a screenshot of the message\nthat's displayed when a victim gets infected:\n\n\"Your computer has been locked,\" reads the message, which then asks the victim to email\nthe hackers. \"After we reply, you must send at least 10 nude pictures of you. After that we\nwill have to verify that the nudes belong to you.\"\n\nThe message is displayed on top of an haphazard background made of several images of\nthe fictional children's character Thomas the Tank Engine and a smiley face with the writing\n\"FUCK YOU!!!\" in bold. It's not clear how many people have been hit with this ransomware,\nor how serious the hackers behind it really are.\n\n**Read more:** **This Is What It Looks Like When You Get Hit with the NotPetya**\n**Ransomware**\n\n\n-----\n\nTo some extent, the malware does appear to be legitimate. The file, nRansom.exe, is\n[classified as malicious by several antivirus engines, including VirusTotal and](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/c89944f9ec704c2b8da3a1acf726699022e7c68334110f72007d762217a9a4a5/analysis/1506022612/) [Hybrid Analysis,](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/c89944f9ec704c2b8da3a1acf726699022e7c68334110f72007d762217a9a4a5?environmentId=100)\nwhich are both public malware repositories. Other users on Twitter also reported spotting\nmore samples of this particular ransomware.\n\nMalware can end up on these repositories if someone manually submits an entry and details\nwhat and does and how, or if malware is submitted and is then automatically analyzed.\nMotherboard attempted to infect a virtual machine with the malware but was unable to do so.\n\nThis could very well be a prank, given that it doesn't actually encrypt files, according to\nMalwareHunterTeam and another researcher who looked at the malware.\n\n\"It is a screenlocker, so files aren't encrypted,\" MalwareHunterTeam told Motherboard in a\nTwitter direct message. \"We have no information about anyone getting infected with this.\"\n\nThe malware also appears to play looped music—from a file called your-mom-gay.mp3 that\nis actually the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme song—in the background, according to the\nMalwareHunterTeam.\n\nWe contacted the hackers via the email address included in their ransom message. They\ndidn't immediately respond to our questions.\n\nIn any case, while this ransomware is clearly gross, sadly, it's not unexpected. Hackers have\n[for years used malware to spy on women and steal their nudes or access their webcams.](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbgbvm/the-dirty-hackers-who-steal-passwords-for-jealous-lovers)\n\n_This story has been updated to note that this ransomware doesn't actually encrypt files._\n\n**_Got a tip?
