On Feb. 1, Adobe issued an\nadvisory confirming the vulnerability exists in Adobe Flash Player 28.0.0.137 and\nearlier versions, and that successful exploitation could potentially allow an attacker to take\ncontrol of the affected system.\n\nFireEye began investigating the vulnerability following the release of the initial advisory from\nKISA.\n\n**Threat Attribution**\n\n\n-----\n\nWe assess that the actors employing this latest Flash zero-day are a suspected North\nKorean group we track as TEMP.Reaper. We have observed TEMP.Reaper operators directly\ninteracting with their command and control infrastructure from IP addresses assigned to the\nSTAR-KP network in Pyongyang. The STAR-KP network is operated as a joint venture\nbetween the North Korean Government's Post and Telecommunications Corporation and\nThailand-based Loxley Pacific. Historically, the majority of their targeting has been focused\non the South Korean government, military, and defense industrial base; however, they have\nexpanded to other international targets in the last year. They have taken interest in subject\nmatter of direct importance to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) such as\nKorean unification efforts and North Korean defectors.\n\nIn the past year, FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has discovered newly developed wiper\nmalware being deployed by TEMP.Reaper, which we detect as RUHAPPY. While we have\nobserved other suspected North Korean threat groups such as TEMP.Hermit employ wiper\nmalware in disruptive attacks, we have not thus far observed TEMP.Reaper use their wiper\nmalware actively against any targets.\n\n**Attack Scenario**\n\nAnalysis of the exploit chain is ongoing, but available information points to the Flash zeroday being distributed in a malicious document or spreadsheet with an embedded SWF file.\nUpon opening and successful exploitation, a decryption key for an encrypted embedded\npayload would be downloaded from compromised third party websites hosted in South\nKorea. Preliminary analysis indicates that the vulnerability was likely used to distribute the\npreviously observed DOGCALL malware to South Korean victims.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nAdobe stated that it plans to release a fix for this issue the week of Feb. 5, 2018. Until then,\nwe recommended that customers use extreme caution, especially when visiting South\nKorean sites, and avoid opening suspicious documents, especially Excel spreadsheets. Due\nto the publication of the vulnerability prior to patch availability, it is likely that additional\ncriminal and nation state groups will attempt to exploit the vulnerability in the near term.\n\n**FireEye Solutions Detections**\n\nFireEye Email Security, Endpoint Security with Exploit Guard enabled, and Network Security\nproducts will detect the malicious document natively. Email Security and Network Security\ncustomers who have enabled the riskware feature may see additional alerts based on\nsuspicious content embedded in malicious documents. Customers can find more information\n[in our FireEye Customer Communities post.](https://community.fireeye.com/docs/DOC-7041)\n\nPrevious Post\nNext Post\n\n\n-----",
