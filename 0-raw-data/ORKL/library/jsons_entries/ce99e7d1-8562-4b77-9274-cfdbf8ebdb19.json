    "plain_text": "# ZINC attacks against security researchers\n\n**[microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/01/28/zinc-attacks-against-security-researchers/](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/01/28/zinc-attacks-against-security-researchers/)**\n\nJanuary 28, 2021\n\nIn recent months, Microsoft has detected cyberattacks targeting security researchers by an\nactor we track as ZINC. The campaign originally came to our attention after Microsoft\nDefender for Endpoint detected an attack in progress. Observed targeting includes pen\ntesters, private offensive security researchers, and employees at security and tech\ncompanies. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) attributes this campaign with high\nconfidence to ZINC, a DPRK-affiliated and state-sponsored group, based on observed\ntradecraft, infrastructure, malware patterns, and account affiliations.\n\n[This ongoing campaign was reported by Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG)](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/new-campaign-targeting-security-researchers/) earlier this\nweek, capturing the browser-facing impact of this attack. By sharing additional details of the\nattack, we hope to raise awareness in the cybersecurity community about additional\ntechniques used in this campaign and serve as a reminder to security professionals that they\nare high-value targets for attackers.\n\nWe also want to thank our industry colleagues at Twitter and GitHub for their collaboration in\nthis investigation and rapid actions to suspend the malicious accounts targeting the security\ncommunity and our mutual customers\n\n\n-----\n\nWe are sharing this information with the community as part of our mission to shine a light on\nbad actors and elevate awareness of low-profile tactics and techniques that easily fly under\nthe radar of security operations centers (SOCs) or security professionals and are easily\noverlooked as low-level alerts or benign chatter. The related IoCs and Microsoft Defender for\nEndpoint product detections we share in this blog will help SOCs proactively hunt for related\nactivity in their environments and elevate any low-level alerts for remediation. ZINC used a\nvariety of new techniques to target the victims, including gaining credibility on social media\nwith genuine content, sending malicious Visual Studio projects, and using a watering hole\nwebsite weaponized with browser exploits.\n\n## Technical details\n\nIn mid-2020, ZINC started building a reputation in the security research community on Twitter\nby retweeting high quality security content and posting about exploit research from an actorcontrolled blog. Throughout the lifetime of the campaign, the actor operated several accounts\nthat accounted for roughly 2,000 followers, including many prominent security researchers.\n\nIn the image below, one of the actor-controlled Twitter account retweets another of their\naccounts to amplify their own posts. The posts from the actors received a reasonable\namount of attention, usually accumulating several hundred likes or retweets.\n\n_Figure 1. Actor-controlled Twitter handles_\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter building their reputation across their established social media accounts, the actors\nstarted approaching potential targets on social media platforms such as Twitter and LinkedIn.\nThe conversations were often seemingly innocuous, asking security questions or talking\nabout exploit techniques. If the researcher was responsive, the actor would offer to move\ncommunication to another platform (e.g., email, Discord) in some cases to then send files\nusing encrypted or PGP protected ZIPs.\n\nZINC also used their Twitter accounts to post links to a security blog they owned\n(br0vvnn[.]io). These links were also shared by many others in the security community on\nTwitter and other social media platforms, further deepening trust for the owner and content.\n\nA blog post titled DOS2RCE: A New Technique To Exploit V8 NULL Pointer Dereference\n_Bug, was shared by the actor on October 14, 2020 from Twitter. From October 19-21, 2020,_\nsome researchers, who hadn’t been contacted or sent any files by ZINC profiles, clicked the\nlinks while using the Chrome browser, resulting in known ZINC malware on their machines\nsoon after. This suggests that a Chrome browser exploit chain was likely hosted on the blog,\nalthough we haven’t been able to prove this. Since some of the victim’s browsers were fully\n[patched, it’s also suspected, but unproven, that the exploit chain used 0-day or patch gap](https://bricata.com/blog/vulnerability-patch-race/)\nexploits. We believe that not all visitors to the site were compromised, even during the dates\nlisted above.\n\n### Malicious Visual Studio project\n\nSome of the files sent by ZINC to researchers were malicious Visual Studio projects that\nincluded prebuilt binaries. One of the binaries used the well-known name Browse.vc.db but\nwas a malicious DLL rather than a database file. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects\nthese DLLs as Comebacker malware. A pre-build event with a PowerShell command was\nused to launch Comebacker via rundll32. This use of a malicious pre-build event is an\ninnovative technique to gain execution.\n\nAn example of the PowerShell in the pre-build event can be seen here:\n\n_<PreBuildEvent>_\n\n_<Command>_\n\n_powershell -executionpolicy bypass -windowstyle hidden_\n_if(([system.environment]::osversion.version.major -eq 10) -and_\n\n_[system.environment]::is64bitoperatingsystem -and (Test-Path x64\\Debug\\Browse.VC.db))_\n_{rundll32 x64\\Debug\\Browse.VC.db,ENGINE_get_RAND 7am1cKZAEb9Nl1pL 4201 }_\n\n_</Command>_\n\n_</PreBuildEvent>_\n\n\n-----\n\nPre-build events are stored in the .vcxproj file in Visual Studio solutions. The page How to:\nUse Build Events in MSBuild Projects has a list of other build events and example XML for\nthe events. It would also be possible to abuse a custom build step in the same way.\n\n### Analyzing Comebacker DLLs\n\nOnce the malicious Visual Studio Project file was built, the process drops\n_C:\\ProgramData\\VirtualBox\\update.bin and adds the file to an autostart registry key._\nUpdate.bin (SHA-256: 25d8ae46…) is a different 64-bit DLL file embedded inside\nBrowser.VC.db.\n\n_HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\SSL Update_\n_“C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe_\n_C:\\ProgramData\\VirtualBox\\update.bin,ASN2_TYPE_new 5I9YjCZ0xlV45Ui8 2907”_\n\nThe actors put some effort into modifying the Comebacker malware attributes between\ndeployments; file names, file paths and exported functions were regularly changed so these\nstatic IOCs can’t be solely relied upon for dependable detection. We were first alerted to the\nattack when Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detected the Comebacker DLL attempting to\nperform process privilege escalation. See the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detections\nsection for a full process chain of the attack.\n\n### Klackring malware\n\nKlackring is a DLL that registers a malicious service on the targeted machine. It was\ndeployed to victims either by the Comebacker malware or an unknown dropper. The DLL\nwas dropped to C:\\Windows\\system32 and saved with the .sys file extension.\n\n### MHTML file\n\nIn addition to the social engineering attacks via social media platforms, we observed that\nZINC sent researchers a copy of a br0vvnn blog page saved as an MHTML file with\ninstructions to open it with Internet Explorer. The MHTML file contained some obfuscated\nJavaScript that called out to a ZINC-controlled domain for further JavaScript to execute. The\nsite was down at the time of investigation and we have not been able to retrieve the payload\nfor further analysis.\n\n### Driver abuse\n\nIn one instance, we discovered the actor had downloaded an old version of the Viraglt64.sys\ndriver from the Vir.IT eXplorer antivirus. The file was dropped to the victim system as\n_C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\circlassio.sys. The actor then attempted to exploit CVE-2017-_\n[16238, described by the finder here, where the driver doesn’t perform adequate checking on](https://www.greyhathacker.net/?p=990)\na buffer it receives, which can be abused to gain an arbitrary kernel write primitive. The\n\n\n-----\n\nactor s code however appears to be buggy and when attempting to exploit the vulnerability\nthe exploit tried to overwrite some of the driver’s own code which crashed the victim’s\nmachine.\n\n### Other malware\n\nOther tools used included an encrypted Chrome password-stealer hosted on ZINC domain\n_https://codevexillium[.]org. The host DLL (SHA-256: ada7e80c…) was downloaded to the_\npath C:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\USOShared.bin using PowerShell and then ran via\n_rundll32. This malware is a weaponized version of CryptLib, and it decrypted the Chrome_\npassword stealer (SHA-256: 9fd0506…), which it dropped to\n_C:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\USOShared.dat._\n\n### C2 communication\n\nAfter establishing a command-and-control (C2) channel on a targeted device, the backdoor\nis configured to check into the C2 servers every 60 seconds. Over this C2 channel, the threat\nactors can execute remote commands to enumerate files/directories and running processes,\nand to collect/upload information about the target device, including IP address, Computer\nName, and NetBIOS. Furthermore, we observed some hands-on-keyboard action to\nenumerate all files/directories on the target disk, create screenshots, and deploy additional\nmodules.\n\n## Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detections\n\nWhen malware is run from a malicious Visual Studio project, the following alerts and process\ntree are generated by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Multiple alerts, including “Use of\nliving-off-land binary to run malware” and “Process Privilege escalation”, were triggered on\nthe execution of Browser.VC.db and update.bin.\n\n[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint has comprehensive detection coverage for this campaign.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/endpoint-defender)\nThese detections raise alerts that inform security operations teams about the presence of\nactivities and artifact from the attacks. Security operations and incident response teams can\nuse investigation and remediation tools in Microsoft Defender Endpoint to perform deep\ninvestigation and additional hunting.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Alert raised by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on ComeBacker_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Alert raised by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on low-reputation arbitrary code_\n_executed by signed executable_\n\n## Recommended actions and preventative measures\n\nIf you visited the referenced ZINC-owned blog (br0vvnn[.]io), you should immediately run a\nfull antimalware scan and use the provided IOCs to check your systems for intrusion. If a\nscan or searching for the IOCs find any related malware on your systems, you should\nassume full compromise and rebuild. Microsoft assesses that security research was the likely\nobjective of the attack, and any information on the affected machine may be compromised.\n\nFor proactive prevention of this type of attack, it is recommended that security professionals\nuse an isolated environment (e.g., a virtual machine) for building untrusted projects in Visual\nStudio or opening any links or files sent by unknown parties.\n\n## Associated indicators of compromise (IOCs)\n\nThe below list provides IOCs observed during this activity. We encourage our customers to\nimplement detections and protections to identify possible prior campaigns or prevent future\ncampaigns against their systems.\n\nAzure Sentinel customers can find a Sentinel query containing these indicators in this GitHub\nrepo: https://github.com/Azure/AzureSentinel/tree/master/Detections/MultipleDataSources/ZincJan272021IOCs.yaml\n\nMicrosoft 365 Defender customers can find related hunting queries below or at this GitHub\nrepo:
