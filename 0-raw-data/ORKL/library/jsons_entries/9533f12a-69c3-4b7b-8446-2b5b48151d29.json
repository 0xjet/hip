According to an Akamai report, there has been a total of 88 billion](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/soti-security-credential-stuffing-in-the-media-industry-report-2020.pdf)\ncredential stuffing attacks from January 2018 to December 2019.\n\nCredential stuffing, a type of a brute-force attack that makes use of botnets to access\nwebsites and online services using stolen credentials, allows financially motivated actors to\ngain unfettered access to victims’ bank accounts and sensitive information. Cybercriminals\nalso profit from stolen credentials by selling them in underground forums and markets.\n\nAs the business of acquiring unique credentials continues to become more lucrative,\ncybercriminals are enriching their attack tools and techniques by abusing legitimate software\nfor nefarious purposes.\n\nIn this blog, we detail how cybercriminals exploit OpenBullet, a legitimate web-testing\nsoftware, to brute-force their way into targeted accounts. Due to OpenBullet’s popularity, a\nwhole market for trading configuration scripts have formed in the underground. We explore\nhow some threat actors compromise the supply chain of OpenBullet configuration scripts by\nsupplying scripts with hidden features. Finally, we also give recommendations on how users\nand organizations can handle multiple passwords efficiently and securely, and provide\nguidance on how they can remain protected from credential stuffing attacks that lead to\naccount takeovers.\n\n## A Closer Look at OpenBullet\n\nOpenBullet is a free web-testing software that enables developers to perform specific\n[requests on target webpages. The open-source tool can be found on GitHub and used for](https://openbullet.github.io/)\ndifferent tasks, including scraping and parsing data, performing automated penetration\ntesting, and unit testing using Selenium.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe software enables users to try multiple **login:password combinations as credential**\nbrute-force attacks on different websites for legitimate purposes, such as penetration testing.\nHowever, it can also be used by cybercriminals in order to discover valid credentials on\ndifferent websites for ill gain.\n\nOpenBullet allows a user to import prebuilt configuration files or configs, one for each\nwebsite to be tested. It also has a flexible editor to modify configs as needed. This is a\nmandatory feature, since websites tend to make slight adjustments to the way that users\nconnect to them in an effort to counter automated tools like OpenBullet.\n\nNotably, OpenBullet’s GitHub page features a warning informing users that the tool shouldn’t\nbe used for credential stuffing on websites that they do not own.\n\nFigure 1. Disclaimer from the OpenBullet GitHub page\n\n### OpenBullet Features That Can Be Abused\n\n**Wordlists**\n\nThis tab allows the user to import thousands of words that can be used when attempting to\nconnect to targeted websites.\n\nAn entry can be as simple as “email address:password” or “login:password”.\n\nWordlists are not provided with the OpenBullet tool. As a result, users would need to find and\nuse their own. However, OpenBullet has a wordlist generator feature.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs an example, we generated a wordlist on OpenBullet using the following characteristics:\n\nUsers’ email addresses that are composed of three digits followed by “@example.com”\nUsers’ passwords that start with “abc” followed by two digits\n\nFigure 2. OpenBullet’s wordlist generator and the extracts of the generated wordlist on a\nNotepad file\nThough this example does not exactly reflect reality, it still shows some possibilities of what\nthe tool can do and how easy it is to create such wordlists.\n\n**Runner**\n\nA user can select this tab to launch a credential attack using OpenBullet. The runner tab\nshows the progress and the number of positive hits for every website that is being tested.\nUsers can also launch multiple runners at the same time.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Screen capture of the runner tab working on OpenBullet\n**Proxies**\n\nSome websites with good security might blocklist the IP address of a penetration tester — or\na cybercriminal — especially if it is being used to make several attempts to log in to several\ndifferent accounts. To avoid this, proxies are used.\n\nProxies are an important part of OpenBullet. They allow users multiple login attempts using a\ndifferent IP address for each attempt. In addition, they can set up the time between each\nconnection attempt, so that each attempt does not raise any alarms on the targeted website\nfor an unusual login activity that typically would be generated by a high number of attempts\nin a very short period.\n\nDifferent kinds of protocols are accepted for proxies in OpenBullet: HTTP, Socks4, Socks4a,\nand Socks5. The more proxies are added to OpenBullet, the better it is for fraudsters. It is\nalso important to note that since proxies are not provided in the tool, users need to rely on\nusing their own, which they can buy from underground forums or from paid proxy services, or\neven discover using internet-scanning techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. OpenBullet’s proxies tab, which features several proxies on different protocols or\nports\n**Tools, Plug-ins, and Settings**\n\nPlug-ins can be easily imported to OpenBullet for different purposes. For example, by using\nadditional plug-ins, users will be able to:\n\nMix a list of usernames and passwords to generate all possible combinations.\nExport the hits from the runner tab directly to an instant messaging platform.\nUse a known successful login or password combination on a big virtual private network\n(VPN) to get a full list of all of its working proxies.\n\nThe possibilities are seemingly endless as long as a user’s purpose involves sending and\ncollecting data to and from a targeted website.\n\nOn the settings tab, OpenBullet users are able to tweak system settings, such as bypassing\nCAPTCHAs or using Selenium, a portable framework for testing web applications. Users\nneed API keys in order to bypass CAPTCHAs. However, API keys are not provided in the\ntool.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. OpenBullet options for CAPTCHAs in the settings tab\n**Configs**\n\nConfigs are the heart of the OpenBullet tool. They are files that are imported to OpenBullet\nfor every website that needs to be tested. Since every website handles authentication or\nlogin differently, a unique config file is needed for every website.\n\nOpenBullet supports multiple config file types, including plain files (.loli, otherwise referred to\nas “LoliScripts”) and encrypted files (.lolix).\n\nIn OpenBullet, configs can be created or modified using an interface called the “stacker,”\nwhich works by executing several tasks called “blocks” in a stack, one after the other.\n\nLet us take a closer look at a config that we found to be targeting a large retail company.\nUsing this particular config, we can see how it is possible to do much more than just\nchecking whether login credentials for authentication work.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Stacker interface showing\n\ndifferent blocks to be executed from top to bottom\nIn the preceding screen capture, we can see seven different blocks: request, key check,\nrequest, and four parse blocks. Each block is called one after the other by OpenBullet when\nthe runner is launched.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. The first request block of a specific config that targets a retail company’s website\nA user can also see and edit the config directly in LoliScript code, as seen in the following\nfigure:\n\nFigure 8. Full config in LoliScript code\nThe script in Figure 8 shows that once logged in, a user can go to the payment preference\npage of a victim company and quietly extract credit card information.\n\nThis is one striking example of the dangerous activities that cybercriminals can do on\nOpenBullet.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Business of OpenBullet Configurations\n\nWhile some OpenBullet configs can be found easily online, other more sensitive configs are\n[sold on dedicated websites or on underground cybercrime forums and marketplaces.](https://openbullet.store/Configs_Shop/configs.html)\nGenerally, config prices average between US$5 to US$10 as of writing.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Types of OpenBullet\n\n\nconfigs available for sale on a dedicated website\n\n\n-----\n\nBecause configs tend to have a limited time of use due to the constantly changing parts of\nwebsites’ authentication processes, the widely adopted business model involves selling\nlicenses to get configs updates as needed.\n\nA single config bought for US$5 might work for some weeks, but when changes are applied\nto the login process, it becomes obsolete. Therefore, users tend to pay monthly licenses to\nget all of the necessary updates.\n\nIt is also not rare to see actors sharing some configs for free in order to attract users to\npurchase more advanced configs.\n\nFigure 10.\n\nAn actor sharing a LoliScript config on a Telegram channel. The script finds valid credential\nlogs from an online antivirus company and steals product and activation codes with expiry\ndates.\n\n## Other Software Abused for Credential Stuffing\n\n\n-----\n\n**OpenBullet variants**\n\nBecause OpenBullet is open-source, it has allowed third-party developers to create their own\n[version of the software (such as SilverBullet and](https://github.com/mohamm4dx/SilverBullet) [OpenBullet Mod, Anomaly) that supports its](https://github.com/PurityWasHere/Anomaly-Mod-Hosting)\nown version of scripts called “anom.” Some of these versions are even more calibrated for\ncybercrime use and can be found easily on online forums.\n\nFigure 11. Example of a third-party OpenBullet version\n**Other Software**\n\nAside from OpenBullet, other software for credential stuffing is available on GitHub or on\nunderground forums.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. A package of tools that are related to credential checking. The package is offered\non an underground forum in the Russian language.\nWhile other tools are available in the underground market, OpenBullet remains a tool favored\nfor abuse by cybercriminals as it offers both comprehensive support and a wide range of\npossibilities. In particular, its wide adoption and the number of available configs make it\npopular among cybercriminals.\n\n**Backdoored Config Files**\n\nThe official OpenBullet configuration format is not obfuscated. However, there are many\nunofficial OpenBullet configuration formats that come in some form of obfuscation. This\nenables the packing of backdoors or so-called hit loggers. In fact, backdoors in OpenBullet\nconfiguration files are very common — so common, in fact, that there are tutorials on how to\nremove them, as evidenced in Figure 13.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. Part of a tutorial on how to remove backdoors in obfuscated OpenBullet configs\nMany tutorials advise using only .loli / .ini / .anom and not to use the encrypted .lolix /\n**.sccfg / .lolim / .lolip for not running obfuscated code. A typical backdoored config might**\nlook like the one in Figure 14.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. Deobfuscated backdoored LoliScript. Sensitive data has been replaced by Xs.\nBasically, backdoors involve the sending of data somewhere. In the example shown, there is\na constant GET request leaking the usernames and passwords to one particular website\ncontrolled by the backdoor controller. Other kind of backdoors can be used to post stolen\ndata on a particular page on a website or on messaging apps like Discord.\n\n## Other Ways Cybercriminals Illegally Obtain Credentials\n\nAside from abusing legitimate software and using malicious software, cybercriminals also\nemploy other tried-and-tested ways in order to obtain user credentials — one of which\n[involves using phishing campaigns.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/what-is/phishing.html)\n\nHowever, phishing campaigns collect a few hundred credentials at best. They also require\nfraudsters to build and host phishing websites to which they would lead victims after sending\nthousands (if not millions) of fraudulent emails per campaign. According to our 2020 Cloud\nApp Security Threat Report, 5,465,969 credential phishing attacks were detected and\nblocked in 2020.\n\nPhishing campaigns typically need resources and time. As a result, this could lead\ncybercriminals to opt for other malicious means that require less effort.\n\nAside from searching for stolen credentials online, cybercriminals compromise websites such\nas large forums and dump their databases. This is why it is important for website\nadministrators to ensure that their databases are encrypted.\n\nCredentials can also be bought from underground websites and forums. Sometimes,\ncredentials can even be obtained for free.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. A compromised website’s full database being sold on an underground forum\nIt is also possible to buy credentials that have been saved in text files, which makes\ncredential reuse easier for fraudsters.\n\nFigure 16. Underground forum showing offers for credentials files\n\n## Typical Uses of Stolen Credentials\n\n\n-----\n\nThe difficulty of having one s credentials stolen doesn t end when fraudsters take hold of\nthem through illicit means. Rather, this could be just the beginning. After all, the many uses\nthat cybercriminals have for stolen credentials can be even more devastating. Just last year,\nwe reported how cybercriminals use stolen credentials such as personally identifiable\ninformation (PII) or credit card data from people who might already be suffering from the\n[global pandemic as cybercriminal prizes for online poker games and rap battles.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/cybercriminals-gamble-with-victims-livelihoods-to-pass-the-covid-19-blues)\n\nThese are the typical uses of stolen credentials:\n\n\n-----\n\n## How to Securely Handle Multiple Passwords\n\nSecurity professionals have always recommended the use of different non-guessable\npasswords for each website and online service.\n\nWhile this recommendation makes sense, most people find it difficult to maintain a list of\nevery password for every website that they need access to. Such difficulty seems inevitable\nin light of the fact that on average, people need to remember 100 passwords for their online\n[accounts and services, according to a NordPass study. Some people opt to write down their](https://tech.co/news/average-person-100-passwords)\ncredentials or save them as an online file as a practical way to keep track of them. Still, these\nmethods are high-risk in nature: If a malicious actor were to get hold of the written document\nor gain access to the file that contains credentials, they would then also gain access to all the\nwebsites and services listed there.\n\n\n-----\n\nFortunately, users can rely on [password managers, digital vaults where passwords can be](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/forHome/products/password-manager.html)\nstored and managed in an efficient and encrypted way. Some password managers even\nhave autocomplete features that can be used for logging in to any website through a\nkeyboard shortcut.\n\nSome of these managers work as online services while others function locally. These\nmanagers store and encrypt passwords and require a master password for access. This\nmeans that a user would only need to remember their master password, after which they can\nproceed to create strong and unique passwords for all of their accounts without needing to\nremember each one.\n\n## How to Stay Protected From Credential Stuffing Attacks\n\nThe following are steps that users and organizations alike can take in order to protect\nthemselves from credential stuffing attacks:\n\n**Practice good password hygiene. Users should avoid using weak passwords while**\norganizations should implement a blocklist of commonly used passwords to prevent\nusers from creating them. Users should also avoid reusing credentials for various\nonline accounts and services. When creating passwords, users must make sure that\neach is unique and remember to change them routinely.\n**Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on websites and services. An increasing**\nnumber of websites and services offer MFA. Generally, MFA consists of a combination\nof external one-time passwords (OTP) that are generated and stored on a device that\nthe attacker should not have access to, such as mobile phones (via texting or a thirdparty application), fingerprints, software security tokens or certificates, and a security\nUSB key. This is by far the most effective defense against credential stuffing attacks.\n**Create a PIN or answer additional security questions. Some websites enable users**\nto answer additional security questions or provide a unique PIN for further\nauthentication.\n**Enable login attempt analysis. Some websites and services such as email service**\nproviders run analyses of login attempts. These are based on different factors,\nincluding:\n**Browser information. An attempt to log in with a different browser, one that is never**\nopted for by a user, could indicate a fraudulent login attempt.\n**IP address. Users who suddenly change the IP address and/or country of origin might**\nbe a good indicator of fraudulent attempt.\n**User behavior anomaly analysis. Users do not browse websites the same way as**\nautomated software or bots do. Therefore, a careful analysis of a user’s behavior can\nhelp trigger alerts and actions to protect the account.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is important to note here that the use of CAPTCHA should not be considered as a secure\nmethod to defeat automated login attempts. As shown earlier, OpenBullet can use several\ndifferent CAPTCHA API keys for evasion purposes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt is undeniable that data breaches are becoming more commonplace and alarming. In\n[February 2021, the Compilation of Many Breaches (COMB) was made available online,](https://cybernews.com/news/largest-compilation-of-emails-and-passwords-leaked-free/)\nexposing a staggering 3.2 billion credentials. In line with such developments, credential\nstuffing attacks are expected to continue rising in number.\n\nDespite an accelerating number of online services allowing users to boost their account\nsecurity by means of enabling either two-factor authentication (2FA) or MFA, the adoption of\nthese security tools remains low. [Research has shown that people tend to ignore 2FA or](https://www.cnet.com/news/why-more-people-dont-use-simple-two-factor-authentication/)\nMFA, thinking that their passwords are already strong enough and that these practices are\n[unnecessary. For instance, a 2018 report divulged that 90% of active Gmail users have not](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16922500/gmail-users-two-factor-authentication-google)\nenabled 2FA.\n\nThe same goes for password managers — although these are effective in securing a large\nnumber of unique passwords, many users still do not use them, let alone trust them.\nAccording to a [survey conducted by Password Manager and YouGov, 65% of Americans](https://www.passwordmanager.com/password-manager-trust-survey/#:~:text=Despite%20the%20fact%20that%20password,to%2021.5%25%20of%20single%20people.)\ndistrust password managers.\n\nGiven the nefarious uses by cybercriminals with regard to stolen credentials, it is vital to have\nmore promotional campaigns that highlight the importance of creating strong, unique, and\nsecure passwords and storing them in password managers. Indeed, users and organizations\ncan only benefit greatly from the widespread adoption of credential security\nrecommendations.\n\n\n-----",
