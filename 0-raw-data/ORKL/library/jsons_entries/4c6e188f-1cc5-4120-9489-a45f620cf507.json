In order to\ninfect the victims, the attackers distributed spear-phishing email, which purports to have been sent from NIC’s\nIncident response team, the attackers spoofed an email id that is associated with Indian Ministry of Defence to send\nout email to the victims. Attackers also used the name of the top NIC official in the signature of the email, this is to\nmake it look like the email was sent by a high ranking Government official working at NIC (National Informatics\nCentre).\n\n**Overview of the Malicious Email**\n\nThe attackers spoofed an email id that associated with Indian Ministry of Defence to send out emails to the victims.\nThe email was made to look like it was sent from NIC’s Incident response team instructing the recipients to read the\nattached documents and to implement the cyber security plan and the signature of the email included the name of\nthe top ranking NIC official. The email contained two attachments, a PDF document and a malicious word document\n(NIC-Cyber Security SOP.doc). The pdf document was a legitimate document which attackers might have\n[downloaded from (http://meity.gov.in/sites/upload_files/dit/files/Plan_Report_on_Cyber_Security.pdf). The word](http://meity.gov.in/sites/upload_files/dit/files/Plan_Report_on_Cyber_Security.pdf)\ndocument attached in the email contained malicious macro code which when enabled, drops a malware backdoor,\nexecutes it and then sends the system information to the command and control server (C2 Server) and its also\ndownloads additional components.\n\nFrom the email (and the attachments shown in the below screenshot) it looks like the goal of the attackers was to\ninfect and take control of the systems of Cyber Security officers who are responsible for managing and implementing\nsecurity controls on the Government network.\n\n\n-----\n\nmailer list associated with Indian Ministry of External Affairs, this indicates that the attackers probably wanted to\ninfect the users connected with Indian Ministry of External Affairs either to spy or to take control of their systems.\n\n**Analysis of Word Document Containing Malicious Macro Code**\n\nOnce the victim opens the attached word document it prompts the user to enable macro as shown below and the\ndocument also contains instruction on how to enable the macros.\n\nIf the victim enables the macro content, the malicious code drops the malware sample and exectutes it and it also\nshows a decoy document containing the instructions and guidelines related to cyber security. This is to make the\nuser believe that is it indeed a document related to cyber security. Below are some of the screen shots showing the\ndocument that will shown to the user once the macro is enabled.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malicious macro code was reverse engineered to understand its capabilities. The macro code is heavily\nobfuscated (uses obscure variable/function names to make analysis harder) as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nexecutable (WINWORD.exe) in the Startup directory and then executes the dropped file as shown in the below\nscreen shots.\n\nOnce the dropped file is executed by macro code it connects to the command and control server(c2 server) and to\nconceal the data sent b the mal are it comm nicates on port 443 (https) as sho n belo The net ork traffic\n\n\n-----\n\n**Analysis of the Dropped Executable (WINWORD.exe)**\n\nThe dropped file was analyzed in an isolated environment (without actually allowing it to connect to the c2 server).\nThis section contains the behavioral analysis of the dropped executable (WINWORD.exe).\n\nThe malware when executed creates additional files on the file system, It downloads these files by contacting the\nC2 server and saves it on the disk. Since the malware was not allowed to contact the C2 server its not clear about\nthe functionality of these files. The below screen shots show WINWORD.exe creating an exectuable, VB script and\nVBE files. The malware uses WScript.exe to execute the VB scripts.\n\nAs mentioned above, malware once executed makes an https connection to the C2 server as shown below.\n\n**C2 Communication Pattern**\n\nUpon execution malware makes an https connection to the url hxxps://webmail[.]duia[.]in/webmail.php. The https\nconnection was intercepted and different network communications were determined.\n\n\n-----\n\nsoftware is installed or not. The malware sends some information in the post data as well, the post data gives the\ninformation about the action that malware will perform. In the below screen shot notice the system information sent\nin the user-agent field and also from the post data it can be deduced that the malware downloads an exe file.\n\nMalware uses similar network communication pattern to download additional files (vbs, vbe, cmd, sc, ext, a3x etc).\nOnce downloaded these files are saved in either “%LocalAppData%\\Temp\\WindowsUpdates” folder or in\n“%Temp%\\WindowsUpdates” folder. During analysis it was determined that the malware used these filenames\n(MS015-0012.exe, MS015-0012.vbs, MS015-0012.vbe etc.) to reside in these directories. Below screen shots\nshows some of the network communication made by the malware to download files.\n\n**C2 Domain Information**\n\n\n-----\n\nreal time if the malware C2 server infrastructure is unavailable. The C2 domain currently resolves to an IP address\nshown below and the same domain was associated with another IP address previously. Both the IP addresses are\nassociated with hosting providers as shown in the screen shot below\n\n\n-----\n\n**Indicators Of Compromise**\n\nThe indicators are provided below, so that they can be used by the organizations (Government, Public and Private\norganizations) to detect and investigate this attack campaign.\n\n**_Dropped Malware Sample:_**\n_4dc28faeb77550174b936d9ba97d4679 (WINWORD.exe)_\n\n**_Network Indicators Associated with C2:_**\n_webmail[.]duia[.]in_\n_hxxps://webmail[.]duia[.]in/webmail.php_\n_95[.]23[.]26[.]28_\n_185[.]100[.]86[.]174_\n\n**_Host Indicators:_**\n_Filenames in the “%Temp%\\WindowsUpdates” folder: MS015-0012.exe, MS015-0012.vbs, MS015-0012.vbe_\n\n\n-----\n\nAttackers in this case made every attempt to launch a clever attack campaign by spoofing email address of Ministry\nof Defence, they also tried to trick the users to believe the email was sent from NIC’s incident response team. To\nmake the attack less suspicious they also used a legitimate PDF document in the attachment and used the name of\nthe top NIC offical in the email signature. The attackers also hosted the C2 server in a Dynamic DNS provider\nnetwork. We believe that such attacker groups are likely working to gain long-term access into Indian Government\nnetworks. With India rapidly moving towards digitization and cashless transactions we believe that more such cyber\nattacks will continue to target Government, Defence, NGOs and financial institutions.\nWe have already reported this attack campaign and shared the associated indicators with the Indian CERT and\nNIC’s Incident response team.\n\n[Follow us on Twitter: @monnappa22](https://twitter.com/monnappa22) [@cysinfo22](https://twitter.com/cysinfo22)\n\n\n-----",
