DPRK Job Opportunity Phishing via WhatsApp\n\n**mandiant.com/resources/blog/dprk-whatsapp-phishing**\n\nIn July 2022, during proactive threat hunting activities at a company in the media industry, [Mandiant Managed Defense identified a novel](https://www.mandiant.com/advantage/managed-defense)\nspear phish methodology employed by the threat cluster tracked as UNC4034. Mandiant has identified several overlaps between this\ngroup and those we suspect have a North Korea nexus.\n\nUNC4034 established communication with the victim over WhatsApp and lured them to download a malicious ISO package regarding a\nfake job offering that led to the deployment of the AIRDRY.V2 backdoor through a trojanized instance of the PuTTY utility.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Managed Defense Threat Hunting Mindset\n\n[One of the cornerstones of the Mandiant Managed Defense service offering is its proactive threat hunting program that protects our](https://www.mandiant.com/advantage/managed-defense)\ncustomers from advanced threat actor’s tools, tactics and techniques that bypass traditional detection mechanisms. Managed Defense\nthreat hunters leverage Mandiant’s deep adversary research and exposure to threat actor behaviors to continually enhance and expand\nour threat hunting capabilities.\n\nThis activity was identified by our Mandiant Intelligence: Staging Directories mission, which searches for anomalous files written to\ndirectories commonly used by threat actors.\n\nThe techniques used by UNC4034 in this compromise, along with the techniques used in countless intrusions investigated by Mandiant,\nare used to continuously develop and refine threat hunting hypotheses within Managed Defense. These provide high fidelity and\nactionable leads that are informed by evolving threat actor tradecraft.\n\n### Initial Lead\n\nThe initial lead was a file downloaded to the host named `amazon_assessment.iso . ISO and IMG archives have become attractive to`\nthreat actors because, from Windows 10 onwards, double-clicking these files automatically mounts them as a virtual disk drive and\nmakes their content easily accessible. This reduces the effort needed to view the embedded files compared to other formats such as\n\n\n-----\n\nRAR archives. Detecting malicious IMG and ISO archives served via phishing attachments is routine for Mandiant Managed Defense.\nThe payloads contained within such archives range from commodity malware to advanced backdoors like the sample analyzed in this\nblog post.\n\n### Phishing Lure\n\nMandiant Managed Defense performed an investigation on the host to determine how the file `amazon_assessment.iso was created.`\nBased on the available data, Mandiant assesses that UNC4034 initiated communication with the victim by offering them a job\nopportunity at Amazon via email. Subsequently, UNC4034 communicated with them over WhatsApp and shared the file\n```\namazon_assessment.iso, which the user downloaded using the web version of WhatsApp.\n\n```\nThe `amazon_assessment.iso archive held two files: an executable and a text file. The text file named` `Readme.txt had connection`\ndetails for use with the second file: `PuTTY.exe .`\n\nFigure 1: Contents of `Readme.txt`\n\n```\nServer:   137.184.15[.]189\n\n```\n```\nUser: test\n\n```\n```\nPass: [Redacted by Mandiant]\n\n```\n\n[PuTTY is an open source SSH and Telnet client. Legitimate, compiled versions of the tool downloaded from the publisher’s website will](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)\nhave a valid digital signature. However, as shown in Figure 2, the `PuTTY.exe binary in the malicious archive does not have a digital`\nsignature\n\nFigure 2: Digital signatures of the officially distributed PuTTY utility (left) and the malicious version (right)\nThe size of the PuTTY binary downloaded by the victim is also substantially larger than the legitimate version. Upon closer inspection, it\nhas a large, high entropy `.data section in comparison to the officially distributed version (Figure 3). Sections like these are typically`\nindicative of packed or encrypted data.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Comparing the .data section in the officially distributed PuTTY utility (left) and the malicious sample (right)\nThe suspicious nature of the `PuTTY.exe embedded in the ISO file prompted Managed Defense to perform a deeper investigation on`\nthe host and the file itself.\n\nThe execution of the malicious PuTTY binary resulted in the deployment of a backdoor to the host. The deployed backdoor is an\nevolution of the malware family Mandiant tracks as AIRDRY. Mandiant Managed Defense successfully investigated the compromise and\ncontained the host before follow-on activity resulting from the deployed backdoor could occur. While Mandiant detected and responded\nto the compromise on 2022-07-05, the same PuTTY executable was seen on VirusTotal as early as 2022-06-27.\n\nIn addition, Mandiant discovered a second ISO archive named `amazon_test.iso uploaded to VirusTotal on 2022-06-17. Mandiant`\nfound the second archive by pivoting from the IP address contained in the `Readme.txt file. This ISO file also had a` `Readme.txt with`\nthe same IP address and a similar trojanized PuTTY executable.\n\nBoth ISO files found by Mandiant appear to use the same lure theme by posing as a recruitment assessment for Amazon. They also\ncontained similarly constructed malware that resulted in a final AIRDRY.V2 backdoor payload.\n\n## Malware Analysis\n\n### Trojanized PuTTY\n\nThe executable embedded in each ISO file is a fully functional PuTTY application (Figure 4) compiled using publicly available PuTTY\nversion 0.77 source code.\n\nFigure 4: PuTTY interface displayed when executing the malicious samples\n\nEach sample contains malicious code that writes an embedded payload to disk and launches it. However, the malicious code was\ninserted at different locations in each of the trojanized PuTTY samples. In the PuTTY sample discovered by Mandiant, the code resides\nin the `connect_to_host function, which is in the source file` `putty-0.77\\ssh\\ssh.c . To trigger the code, the user must attempt an`\nSSH connection to the host IP address provided in the `Readme.txt file (Figure 1).`\n\nIn the PuTTY sample discovered on VirusTotal, the malicious code was inserted into the `ssh2_userauth_process_queue function`\n(source file: `putty-0.77\\ssh\\userauth2-client.c ). The code resides in the part of the function responsible for performing password`\nauthentication, as opposed to other methods such as public key or keyboard-interactive authentication. Once the user establishes a\nconnection and enters their username and password, the malicious code is executed regardless of the authentication result. These\nexecution guardrails are likely an attempt by UNC4034 to avoid unnecessarily dropping the next stage of their malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe part of the malicious code that drops and executes a payload is nearly identical between the two samples. The legitimate Windows\nexecutable `C:\\Windows\\System32\\colorcpl.exe is copied to the new directory` `C:\\ProgramData\\PackageColor and the`\nembedded payload is written to `C:\\ProgramData\\PackageColor\\colorui.dll . The PuTTY binary observed in the compromise`\nlaunches `colorui.dll via DLL search order hijacking using the command shown in Figure 5.`\n\nFigure 5: Observed `colorcpl.exe execution`\n```\n C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c start /b C:\\ProgramData\\PackageColor\\colorcpl.exe\n 0CE1241A44557AA438F27BC6D4ACA246\n\n```\nIn the VirusTotal sample, `cmd.exe is not used to launch` `colorcpl.exe . Instead, the Windows API function` `WinExec launches the`\nprocess shown in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6: VirusTotal sample execution\n\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\PackageColor\\colorcpl.exe C8E71F4613ABFCA10B6330C9\n\n```\n\nIn both instances, the command-line argument passed to `colorcpl.exe is not related to the legitimate function of the Windows`\nexecutable. Instead, each argument is utilized by the malicious DLL as described below.\n\nPersistence is established for `C:\\ProgramData\\PackageColor\\colorcpl.exe via` `schtasks.exe . A scheduled task named`\n```\nPackageColor executes colorcpl.exe at 10:30AM local time every day.\n\n### Malicious DLL\n\n```\nThe `colorui.dll samples were packed using the commercial software protector Themida. The unpacked samples contain file paths`\nthat reveal their purpose. An example path is shown in Figure 7.\n\nFigure 7: Embedded file path that has the string “ ShellCodeLoader ”\n\n```\nW:\\Develop\\aTool\\ShellCodeLoader\\App\\libressl-2.6.5\\crypto\\cryptlib.c\n\n```\n\nBoth samples contain an identical shellcode payload named DAVESHELL. The payload is decrypted using a custom XOR-based\nalgorithm with a dynamically generated key. The key is the result of concatenating the following strings:\n\n1. Parent process name ( COLORCPL.EXE )\n\n2. Malicious DLL filename ( COLORUI.DLL )\n\n3. Command-line argument passed to `colorcpl.exe by the PuTTY executable`\n\nThe necessary decryption key for the VirusTotal sample is shown in Figure 8.\n\nFigure 8: Decryption key for the PuTTY sample found on VirusTotal\n\n```\nCOLORCPL.EXECOLORUI.DLLC8E71F4613ABFCA10B6330C96CA3D3B1\n\n```\n\nThe inclusion of this key also serves as an anti-analysis mechanism: without the correct key, nothing of significance happens when the\nDLL is executed.\n\nThe command-line argument passed to `colorcpl.exe also dictates how the decrypted shellcode is executed. Based on this`\nargument, `colorui.dll may execute the shellcode from within` `colorcpl.exe or inject it into a new instance of a legitimate`\nWindows process. In the case of process injection, the injection target is chosen randomly between `credwiz.exe or` `iexpress.exe .`\n\nThe [injected shellcode payload is DAVESHELL, a publicly available dropper in the form of shellcode that executes an embedded](https://github.com/monoxgas/sRDI)\npayload in memory. The embedded payload is a VMProtect-packed evolution of the AIRDRY backdoor.\n\n### AIRDRY.V2\n\n[The AIRDRY backdoor, also known as BLINDINGCAN, has been thoroughly documented in reports published by CISA and](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-232a) [JPCERT.](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2020/09/BLINDINGCAN.html)\nThese earlier versions of AIRDRY supported numerous backdoor commands including file transfer, file management, and command\nexecution. In the most recent version, however, the traditional backdoor commands have been removed in favor of a plugin-based\napproach that supports multiple communication modes. The details that follow address the evolution to AIRDRY.V2 and highlight\nsimilarities with previous versions.\n\nThe backdoor’s configuration is AES-128 encrypted in CBC mode with the hard-coded key `KAA5M8MNDKLJB8PI . An integrity check is`\nperformed on both the encrypted and decrypted configuration The backdoor exits if the check fails\n\n\n-----\n\nThe decrypted configuration contains the backdoor s communication mode. Supported modes are listed in Table 1 along with their\ncorresponding internal class names, where applicable. All three modes are centralized around a class named `CSinSocket .`\n\nTable 1: AIRDRY.V2 communication modes\n\n**Mode** **Class Name** **Description**\n\nHTTP `CHTTP_Protocol` Communication via HTTP\n\nFile `CFileRW` Communication via a file\n\nSMB N/A Communication via SMB over a named pipe\n\nThe structure of the embedded configuration is dependent on the communication mode. The observed sample is configured to use\nHTTP. The structure of its 0x24B0-byte configuration is outlined in Table 2. No SMB or file mode versions of AIRDRY.V2 have been\nidentified and thus their configuration structure is unknown.\n\nTable 2: HTTP-mode configuration structure\n\n**Offset** **Description**\n\n\n-----\n\n`0x105A` Report if there is an active RDP session\n\n`0x105E` Beacon interval in seconds\n\n`0x1060` Start date and time (empty)\n\n`0x1068` System ID\n\n`0x106C` Unknown\n```\n 0x18A0 c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\n 0x1AA8 %temp%\n\n```\n`0x1CB0` Unknown\n\n[The configuration layout above is like the one outlined in Appendix A of the JPCERT report. The maximum beacon count stored at offset](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2020/09/BLINDINGCAN.html)\n```\n0x1054 reflects the number of times the backdoor attempts to connect to a command and control (C2) server before waiting the\n\n```\namount of time stored at offset `0x105E . The current sample is configured to beacon up to five times before sleeping for 60 seconds.`\n\nBy default, the backdoor is not configured to use a proxy server. It is also not configured to report the status of available disk space\n(offset `0x1056 ) or the presence of an active RDP session (offset` `0x105E ). However, these features could be enabled via a`\nconfiguration update issued by a C2 server.\n\nThe configuration strings at offsets `0x18A0 and` `0x1AA8 are not referenced in the code but have been seen in previous AIRDRY`\nconfigurations. It’s possible these strings remain in the configuration for use by a downloaded plugin.\n\nThe configuration value at offset `0x1060 reflects the date and time after which the backdoor should begin communicating with its C2`\nservers. This value is empty in the current configuration, which results in communication beginning immediately. However, the value can\nbe updated via a command from a C2 server, which could result in the backdoor being inactive for a period of time.\n\nThe backdoor’s C2 URL count is five; however, the configuration only has three distinct URLs (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 9: Configured C2 URLs\n\n```\nhxxps://hurricanepub[.]com/include/include.php\n\n```\n```\nhxxps://turnscor[.]com/wp-includes/contacts.php\n\n```\n```\nhxxps://www.elite4print[.]com/support/support.asp\n\n```\n\nThe backdoor issues an HTTP POST request to a randomly selected C2 URL. An example request is shown in Figure 10.\n\nFigure 10: Example HTTP POST request\n```\n bbs=VkxXU1lPvBGI7BJ40K4=shD5nhF+2amakV9H&article=EAAAABIAAAAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgu\n PGZC0NvqYJ/yy4qGzW98G5M6Ab5UDNTt3lna8k/O8=\n\n```\n\nThe `bbs and` `article field names in the request body are hard-coded. The decoded Base64 data assigned to the bbs field aligns`\n[closely with the format outlined in the JPCERT report, including the same custom RC4 implementation. Where AIRDRY.V2’s request](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2020/09/BLINDINGCAN.html)\nstructure differs from its predecessor is the second field, which is used to send command-related data. Prior to being Base64 encoded,\nthe `article data is compressed using LZ4 and then encrypted with AES. The AES-256 key is derived using the SHA256 hash of a`\nhard-coded 32-byte sequence.\n\nAIRDRY.V2’s file mode uses the same HTTP request format but writes each request to a file. The file path is built based on elements\nfound in the backdoor’s configuration. Because a file mode version of AIRDRY.V2 has not been identified, the purpose behind writing\nHTTP requests to a file has yet to be determined. In SMB mode, the backdoor communicates by sending an SMB2 WRITE request to a\nnamed pipe. The host name and pipe name are specified in the configuration.\n\nLike previous AIRDRY backdoors, AIRDRY.V2 utilizes the value `0x2040 to request a command from a C2 server. Supported command`\nIDs are listed in Table 3.\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 3: Supported command IDs\n\n**Command ID** **Description**\n\n`0x2009` Upload basic system information\n\n`0x2028` Update the beacon interval based on a value provided by the C2 server\n\n`0x2029` Deactivate until new start date and time\n\n`0x2031` Upload the current configuration\n\n`0x2032` Update the configuration\n\n`0x2037` Keep-alive\n\n`0x2038` Update the beacon interval based on a value in the configuration\n\n`0x2052` Update the AES key used to encrypt C2 requests and configuration data\n\n`0x2057` Download and execute a plugin in memory\n\nAIRDRY.V2 supports nine commands. Prior versions of AIRDRY supported nearly thirty commands. Of the nine commands, only two\nwere not present in previous AIRDRY samples: `0x2052 and` `0x2057 . Command` `0x2052 can be used to update the 32-byte`\nsequence used to derive the AES-256 key described above. Command ID `0x2057 represents the shift from a backdoor that`\nsupports numerous commands to the new plugin-based approach in AIRDRY.V2.\n\nDownloaded plugins are executed in memory and provided with a structure that includes a copy of the decrypted configuration, the\nsystem ID, and an object that facilitates communication with the configured C2 servers. Notably the backdoor itself has the necessary\nlogic to function as a plugin.\n\n## Threat Actor Spotlight: UNC4034\n\nMandiant identified several overlaps between UNC4034 and threat clusters we suspect have a North Korean nexus. The AIRDRY.V2 C2\nURLs belong to compromised website infrastructure previously leveraged by these groups and reported in several OSINT sources. Of\nnote is the prior use of this compromised infrastructure to deliver the AIRDRY backdoor via CUTELOOP downloaders embedded in\nmalicious documents.\n\nBased on the identified overlaps and the social engineering tactics used, Mandiant suspects this activity represents an extension of\n[enduring “Operation Dream Job” campaigns that leverage a different attack chain with ISO files and trojanized binaries rather than](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dream-Job-Campaign.pdf)\nweaponized documents. This is likely one of several malware delivery techniques being employed by North Korean actors after a target\nhas responded to a fabricated job lure. Recent public reporting also details the usage of other social media platforms to pose as\n[legitimate companies and post fake job advertisements that target cryptocurrency developers.](https://www.scmagazine.com/analysis/cybercrime/north-korean-threat-actors-imitate-coinbase-with-fake-job-offer-for-crypto-pros)\n\nThe use of ISO files has become increasingly popular in the delivery of both commodity and targeted malware. Mandiant has observed\n[well-known actors, such as APT29, adopting the use of ISO files to deliver their malware.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/tracking-apt29-phishing-campaigns)\n\n## Detection Opportunities\n\nThe investigation into this compromise revealed new leads and indicators to pivot from in future hunting efforts. An important caveat to\nthese hunting leads is that they are not indicators of compromise. Instead, they are interesting activity that may call for further\ninvestigation by an analyst.\n\nThese include ISO and IMG archive files downloaded from sources such as WhatsApp, email providers, and cloud storage services. On\n_Windows 10 and later, the origin URL of a downloaded file is stored in the_ `Zone.Identifier alternate data stream. Mandiant routinely`\nobserves archive files delivered as phishing attachments that originate from those sources.\n\nThe second hunting lead is the execution of `colorcpl.exe from an unusual directory like` `C:\\ProgramData\\PackageColor . Most`\noften the executable runs from its standard location in C:\\Windows\\System32 or C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\n\n\n-----\n\nThe third hunting lead found for future hunting efforts is the execution of `colorcpl.exe with command line arguments. By default,`\n```\ncolorcpl.exe executes with no command line arguments. In this scenario, colorcpl.exe was executed with a command-line\n\n```\nargument that consisted of hexadecimal characters. The argument was ultimately evaluated by a malicious DLL that was loaded into the\nprocess.\n\nMandiant consistently finds new and novel threat actor activity such as the one described in this blog post. To ensure our customers are\nprotected, Mandiant’s detection and threat hunting capabilities are continuously evolving and are fueled by our experiences on the\nfrontlines.\n\n## Malware Family Definitions\n\n### DAVESHELL\n\n[DAVESHELL is shellcode that functions as an in-memory dropper.
