We have been tracking this group as\n“SNOWSTORM” since late 2016.\n\n\n-----\n\nDark Basin (AKA SNOWSTORM) have been publicly linked to the Indian technology\ncompany “BellTroX” by University of Toronto cyber research group Citizen Lab in a\n[June 2020 report.](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/06/dark-basin-uncovering-a-massive-hack-for-hire-operation/)\nAs well as the electronic phishing campaign, the client was most likely placed under\nphysical surveillance at a time coinciding with the beginning of the email phishing\ncampaign.\nThe client was a financial analyst holding a short position on a large business entity at\nthe time and was involved in a dispute due to research they had published alleging\nfraud.\nThe Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) used by the cyber-attackers included\nthe use of tailored targeted “spear-phishing” emails, URL shortening techniques, and\nAmazon AWS cloud infrastructure for delivery of the emails.\nThe group also used commercial marketing email tracking software to monitor the\n“opened” status of emails sent to targets and to manage the campaign.\nThe TTPs tracked closely to those reported by Citizen Lab and the report listed\nseveral domains we identified as linked to SNOWSTORM, strongly suggesting that\nDark Basin was responsible for the activity we tracked under the name\nSNOWSTORM.\nAlthough almost certainly illegal, hacking techniques have been used by some\nunscrupulous private investigators. Compromising email accounts of targets offers\ninterested parties a deep insight into the activities of their target.\n\n## The Citizen Lab Dark Basin analysis\n\n[University of Toronto body, The Citizen Lab, have published an extensive analysis on the](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/06/dark-basin-uncovering-a-massive-hack-for-hire-operation/)\nactivities of an alleged hacker-for-hire group they call “Dark Basin”. MDR Cyber have been\ntracking this group as SNOWSTORM since late 2016 following the targeting of a Mishcon\nde Reya client.\n\nDark Basin have a wide targeting arc including financial services, legal services, the energy\nsector and Government bodies. The Citizen Lab assessed that the group were likely\nengaged in commercial espionage, noting targets included opponents in high-profile public\nevents, criminal cases, financial transactions, news stories, and advocacy. The researchers\nlinked the group “with high confidence” to BellTroX InfoTech Services (“BellTroX”), an Indian\ntechnology company.\n\n## The target\n\nOne of the Dark Basin campaigns targeted financial journalists, short sellers and hedge\nfunds. Our client Matthew Earl, was a financial analyst, who had published allegations of\nfraud at a large business entity at the time and held a short position.\n\n\n-----\n\nMatthew instructed our Reputation Protection team, as he was threatened with defamation\nproceedings by the firm he was investigating. At the same time as receiving aggressive\nlegal correspondence, he started to receive highly targeted phishing attacks, which\nattempted to steal credentials. We identified that a specific group was likely behind the\nattacks. As part of our investigation we began tracking the group behind the attacks using\nthe name SNOWSTORM.\n\nIt was likely that the objectives of the attack were to understand if our client had been the\nrecipient of whistleblowing or other inside information or evidence that would substantiate\nhis allegations of fraud.\n\n## Attribution and Links to Private Investigators\n\nOur client came under targeted physical surveillance at the same time as the cyber-attacks\nstarted, which included an intimidating doorstep visit from high-profile private investigators\nand overt surveillance. The coordinated cyber and physical surveillance was extremely\nstressful for our client and his young family, causing fears for their physical security.\n\nWe cannot determine how SNOWSTORM became involved or who hired them. It is unlikely\nto be the firm Matthew was investigating as Hacker-for-hire groups do not advertise widely.\nOnce we ascertained that private investigators were involved our team began to look further\ninto the hacking for hire market.\n\nConversely the information in the targeted emails and the phishing lures could only have\ncome from someone deeply involved in the matter, most probably either the ultimate client\nor other interested party. This indicates that the hacking operation was being orchestrated\nas part of a larger campaign.\n\nWhen investigating SNOWSTORM, we were made aware by The Citizen Lab that an Indian\nfirm was involved in hacking for hire. Enquiries by our team in the private investigations\nmarket provided anecdotal evidence that a group was being used as part of these types of\ninvestigations and was also connected to India supporting their assessment.\n\nThis led us to the conclusion that an Indian hacking for hire firm was being likely being used\nby private investigators.\n\n## Tactics, techniques and procedures\n\nWe saw an increase in attempts to access our clients account and those of connected\nfamily members. This indicated a level of open source intelligence gathering to identify\nfamily members, as well as potential password guessing attempts.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group used highly targeted phishing emails with subject matter that directly involved the\ntarget. The sender addresses and emails mimicked media organizations. The content of the\nemails stood out as more tailored and sophisticated than those we usually see, alongside\nmore generic phishing emails.\n\nIn the attacks we investigated, SNOWSTORM used a public URL-shortener and the emails\nused a commercial marketing email tracking service to see if the emails had been opened\nor read.\n\nThe links contained in the emails led to fake login pages that attempted to capture\ncredentials.\n\n## The impact\n\nMany of the targets of sophisticated cyber-attacks are nameless, or their experience is\ntempered by being part of an organization which can protect them. We worked closely with\nMatthew during the incident, and have over the last three and a half years continued to\ninvestigate what occurred.\n\nMatthew describes the experience of being targeted by the group. \"The receipt of\n_aggressive legal correspondence, targeted physical surveillance and sophisticated digital_\n_hacking are each, at a singular level, stressful enough. However, the sudden and_\n_coordinated combination of all three was traumatising for my family and myself. Especially_\n_in light of the scale and significant resources that were used.\"_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCyber-attacks now affect every industry. It may come as no surprise that errant\ninvestigators, who may previously have relied on pretexting or paying for information, have\nnow turned to bringing in cyber expertise.\n\nWe are grateful to Matthew for continuing to support our investigation. Matthew commented\nthat \"A key reason my family managed to get through that period was due to the help and\n_support from Mishcon de Reya, which gave comfort that despite the overwhelming nature of_\n_the experience, we were in fact not alone and it could be dealt with.\"_\n\nWe are continuing to monitor groups who operate in this area along with their use by some\nelements of private investigations market. We believe that commercial espionage has the\npotential to be as high-profile as that conducted by nation states.\n\n\n-----",
