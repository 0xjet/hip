We’ve seen examples of\nthis attack campaign, which we’ve named “MILE TEA” (MIcrass Logedrut Elirks TEA),\nappearing as early as 2011, and that it has since expanded the scope of targets. It involves\nmultiple malware families and often tricks targets by sending purported flight e-tickets in email\nattachments. The identified targets include three separate Japanese trading companies, a\nJapanese petroleum company, a mobile phone organization based in Japan, the Beijing office\nof a public organization of Japan, and a government agency in Taiwan.\n\n## Attack Overview\n\nFigure 1 shows the number of attacks considered as a part of the MILE TEA campaign since\n2011. As we can see, the volume of the threats is small in total.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1 Number of threats used in the attack campaign_**\n\nIn the first three years, most of the reported attacks were from Taiwan. saw infections in a few\nother countries in Asia, but the number was miniscule. In mid-2013, the target base shifted to\nJapan. Since 2015, most of the reported attacks are from Japan.\n\n**_Figure 2 Reports by countries_**\n\nThe primary infection vector is a spear phishing email with a malicious attachment. Although\nwe collected several document based exploit files (RTF, XLS, and PDF) in this attack\ncampaign, most of the attachments were executable files that, interestingly, suggest a custom\nmalware installer. Attackers often [use self-extracting executable files or existing installer](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/08/unit42-aveo-malware-family-targets-japanese-speaking-users/)\npackages to reduce development costs if they require dropping multiple files. However, in this\ncampaign, the attacker group created its own installer program with the following features:\n\nWindows executable with folder icon\nCreates directory with pre-determined name in the same path as the installer\n\n\n-----\n\nCopies decoy files into the created directory\nInstalls a batch file and malware on Temp Dir\nExecutes a batch script to delete the installer\n\nFigure 3 shows examples of the custom installer and its different folder icons.\n\n**_Figure 3 Custom installers with the folder icon_**\n\nThe use of e-flight tickets as phishing lures has been seen repeatedly for a number of years.\nThe following is the list of malicious attachment samples that use this technique. It is the most\nprevalent lure used by this threat actor to entice targets for this campaign.\n\n**Target** **Year** **SHA256**\n\n**Japan** 2016 71d5bc9404aa2aa40d79cb16837246a31fa3f12b195330a091e3867aa85f1bc6\n\n**Taiwan** 2015 7b1509051ccacc4676bf491f63c8a8c7c3b42ffd6cbf3d8bb1dd0269424df985\n\n**Japan** 2014 8c338446764db7478384700df811937dabc3c6747f54fd6325629e22e02de2cc\n\n**Taiwan** 2014 b393b9774c32de68b35bffd43ace22f9e9d695545de02d8b1d29c8ae38db3488\n\n**Taiwan** 2014 4607aa975fd9b5aaebe684b26fa31d8ef0840682b148dbcf7f57e9c35d107eb6\n\n**Taiwan** 2013 f23ab2ee9726c4061b2e0e7f6b9491e384de8103e410871c34b603326b7672da\n\n**Taiwan** 2013 5de5346613be67e3e3bdf82c215312e30bf5ab07aafd0da0e6967897752e0c1d\n\n**Taiwan** 2013 1ed808c7909bde7164d81a8c752a62ced116e03cfb6c7502019d84340f04b76a\n\n**Taiwan** 2012 b6034a3fc6e01729166a4870593e66d9daf0cdff8726c42231662c06358632a7\n\n**Taiwan** 2012 f18ddcacfe4a98fb3dd9eaffd0feee5385ffc7f81deac100fdbbabf64233dc68\n\n**_Table 1 Samples of malicious attachments masquerading as E-Ticket_**\n\n## Malware\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this MILE TEA campaign, the actor uses the following three malware families as the initial\ninfection by the custom installer. The primary purpose of these families is to establish a\nbridgehead, collecting system information and downloading additional malware from a remote\nserver.\n\n**Malware** **Executable Type** **Cipher** **C2 address from Blog**\n\n**Elirks** PE, PE64, DLL TEA, AES Yes\n\n**Micrass** PE TEA No\n\n**Logedrut** PE, MSIL DES Yes\n\n**_Table 2 Malware characteristics_**\n\nWhile many security vendors classify these samples as different malware families, they share\nfunctionality, code, and infrastructure, leading us to conclude that they in fact belong to the\npreviously mentioned malware families.\n\n**Functionality – Blog Access**\n\n[As described in the previous blog post, one of the unique features of Elirks is that it retrieves a](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/06/unit42-tracking-elirks-variants-in-japan-similarities-to-previous-attacks/)\ncommand and control (C2) address from a public-facing blog service. When configured, the\nmalware accesses a predetermined blog page, discovers a specific string, and proceeds to\ndecode it with Base64 and decrypts it using the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) cipher. The\nsame functionality is found in Logedrut, however, instead of using the TEA cipher, it uses DES.\n\nA sample of Logedrut\n(afe57a51c5b0e37df32282c41da1fdfa416bbd9f32fa94b8229d6f2cc2216486) accesses a free\nblog service hosted in Japan and reads the following article posted by the threat actor.\n\n**_Figure 4 Encoded C2 address posted by attacker_**\n\nThe routine called GetAddressByBlog() in Logedrut looks for text between two pre-defined\nstrings. In this particular case, the malware sample will look for test between \"doctor fish\" and\n\"sech yamatala\". The threat determines encoded text is\n\n\n-----\n\npKuBzxxnCEeN2CWLAu8tj3r9WJKqblE+ and proceeds to handle it using the following\nfunction.\n\n**_Figure 5 Code finding encoded C2 address from blog_**\n\nThis code deciphers the string with BASE64 and DES. So far all Logedrut samples use exactly\nthe same key, 1q2w3e4r, for decryption. The following Python code can be used to decode the\nC2 address.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n\nimport base64\nimport Crypto.Cipher.DES\n\nencoded_string = \"pKuBzxxnCEeN2CWLAu8tj3r9WJKqblE+\"\niv = key = \"1q2w3e4r\"\n\ndecoded_string = base64.b64decode(encoded_string)\ndes = Crypto.Cipher.DES.new(key, Crypto.Cipher.DES.MODE_CBC, iv)\ndecrypted_string = des.decrypt(decoded_string)\n\nprint decrypted_string\n\n\n**Code - TEA with XOR**\n\nElirks and Micrass employ exactly the same TEA cipher. TEA is a block cipher that operates\nagainst 64-bit (8 bytes) of data at a time to encrypt and decrypt. The author of the code added\nand extra cipher operation by XORing data when a block size is less than 64 bits. For example,\nif the encrypted data length is 248 bits (31 bytes), the code in both malware samples decrypts\nthe first three blocks (64 x 3 = 192 bits) with TEA. The final block is only 56 bits (248 - 192 =\n56), so the code uses a simple XOR operation against the remaining data. This supplement to\n\n\n-----\n\nTEA has not been widely used, and all Elirks and Micrass samples have the same static key\n(2D 4E 51 67 D5 52 3B 75) for the XOR operation. Due to these similarities, we can conclude\nthat the author of both families may be the same, or has access to the same source code.\n\n**_Figure 6 TEA with XOR Cipher in Elirks and Micrass_**\n\n**Infrastructure - C2 Servers**\n\nBased on our analysis, we see that only a handful samples share the same infrastructure\ndirectly. The threat actors carefully minimize reusing C2 domains and IP addresses among\ntheir malware samples, and yet they prefer using servers located in Hong Kong no matter\nwhere the target resides.\n\n**_Figure 7 Location of C2 servers_**\n\n## Target Analysis\n\n**Identifying targets from spear-phishing emails**\n\n\n-----\n\nWe found a spear phishing email sent to a government agency in Taiwan on March 2015. The\nemail sender masquerades as an airline company, and the RAR archive attachment contains\nthe custom installer named Ticket.exe that drops Ticket.doc and Micrass malware.\n\n**_Figure 8 Spear-phishing email sent to an agency in Taiwan_**\n\nDuring the analysis of the email, we came across an article in a Taiwan newspaper from\nFebruary 2014 that alerted the public about a similar email message being widely distributed\nthat contained a malicious attachment. The only difference between the email messages in\n[Figure 8 and in the news article was the date. The adversary reused the email message more](http://news.ltn.com.tw/news/life/breakingnews/957005)\nthan a year ago.\n\n**Identifying targets from decoy files**\n\nThe most interesting part of this attack campaign is that the threat actor has been using stolen\ndocuments from previously compromised organizations to perform additional attacks since\nearly 2015. These documents are not publicly available nor do they look to be created from\nscratch by the attacker. Because they contain sensitive data tying to the specific business, it is\nunlikely that a third party would be able to craft them.\n\nThe following figure shows the decoy file installed by a sample identified in early April 2015.\nThe file is a weekly report created at the end of March 2015 by a salesperson at a Japanese\ntrading company. The report includes various sensitive information specific to their business.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 9 Weekly report from a Japanese trading company_**\n\nThe properties identified within the document indicate that the company name matches the\ncontext, and the person who last modified it is the same individual seen in the document itself.\nBecause of this, the file appears legitimate and it’s very unlikely that this document would ever\nbe made publicly available. The threat actor almost certainly stole this document soon after it\nwas created, and reused it as the decoy for next target within a week of the theft.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 10 Property of the decoy document_**\n\nAnother installer found in Japan in May 2015 also contained sensitive information. The decoy\nlooks to be a draft version of a legitimate contract addendum between the subsidiary of a\nJapanese petroleum company based in Australia, and a China-based company. The document\nprovides details of the deal, including price. It contains a bunch of tracked changes by what\nappears to be two Japanese speaking individuals. We have confirmed that one of the\nindividuals was a manager of an overseas project of the parent company in Japan by the\nofficial release of personnel change in 2013. The file is also considered to be stolen from a\ntarget organization and used for decoy for the next attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 11 Contract addendum decoy file_**\n\nIn addition to those examples, we found the following decoy files that are likely stolen from\npreviously compromised organizations.\n\n**Organization** **Type of document**\n\n**Beijing Office of a public organization of Japan** Budget Report\n\n**Another Trading Company in Japan** Internal investigation document\n\n**Mobile phone organization in Japan** Inventory of new smartphones\n\n**_Table 3 Potential source of another decoy file_**\n\nWe cannot confirm whether those files were stolen as part of the MILE TEA campaign or not.\nEither way, it’s difficult to imagine that the threat actor sent those internal documents to entirely\ndifferent organization or industries. One plausible explanation would be that the threat actors\ntarget different persons or departments within same organization or industry.\n\n**Identifying target from Malware**\n\n\n-----\n\nSo far, we have described two trading companies in Japan that are possibly targeted. In\naddition to these two companies, there is another company in Japan that could be involved in\nthe attack campaign as well. A sample of Logedrut was identified and is capable of\ncommunicating with C2 through an internal proxy server in the compromised organization. The\nsample contains an internal proxy address for a trading company in Japan as seen in String7 in\nthe image below. Thus, the sample is specially crafted for this specific enterprise.\n\n**_Figure 12 Internal proxy address in Logedrut_**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMILE TEA is five-year-long targeted attack campaign focused on businesses and government\nagencies in Asia Pacific and Japan. The threat actor behind this maintains and uses multiple\nmalware families, including a custom installer. The actor is interested in organizations that\nconduct business in multiple countries. The trading companies cover an immensely broad area,\nfrom commodity products to aviation around the world. Another possible target is a Japanese\npetroleum company that has multiple offices and subsidiary companies in overseas countries.\nA public organization in Japan and a government agency in Taiwan were also targeted.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:\n\n1. WildFire accurately identifies all malware samples related to this operation as malicious.\n2. Domains used by this operation have been flagged as malicious in Threat Prevention.\n[3.
