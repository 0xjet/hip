It relies on spearphishing emails sent to specific and strategic companies to conduct its campaigns. On Feb. 20, the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence team\nwitnessed a new campaign where the threat actor impersonated a Colombian government tax agency to target key industries in Colombia,\nincluding health, financial, law enforcement, immigration, and an agency in charge of peace negotiation in the country.\n\nBased on the infector vector and payload deployment mechanism, we also uncovered campaigns targeting Ecuador, Chile, and Spain.\n\n### Brief MITRE ATT&CK Information\n\n**Tactic** **Technique**\n\nInitial Access T1566.001\n\nExecution T1204.001, T1204.002, T1059.005, T1059.001, T1059.003\n\nPersistence T1053.005, T1547.001\n\nDefense Evasion T1218.009\n\n### Weaponization and Technical Overview\n\n**Weapons** PDF for lures, Visual Basic Scripts, .NET Assemblies injected in memory, Malicious DLLs, PowerShell\n\n**Attack Vector** Spear-phishing attachment with PDF\n\n**Network Infrastructure** DDNS DuckDNS, Discord, Web Applications\n\n**Targets** Entities in Colombia\n\n### Technical Analysis\n\n**Context**\n\nAPT-C-36 is a [South American cyber espionage group that has been actively targeting Latin America-based entities over the last few years.](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0099/)\n[Although most of its efforts have been focused on Colombia, according to research conducted by CheckPoint researchers, it has also carried out](https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/blindeagle-targeting-ecuador-with-sharpened-tools/)\nintrusions against Ecuador.\n\nThe main targets of this group for the last few years have been those related to financial and governmental entities.\n\nThe initial vector for infection is typically a PDF attachment sent by email. In the case we’ll be examining in this report, the sender of the\nphishing email opted to use the Blind Carbon Copy (BCC) field instead of the To: field, most likely in an attempt to evade spam filters. They\norchestrated their scam to correspondencia@ccb.org.co, which is the official email address listed on the Contact Us page of the Bogota\nChamber of Commerce website. Bogotá, of course, is the Capital of Colombia.\n\nThe email's Subject line reads, \"Obligaciones pendientes - DIAN N.2023-6980070- 39898001\" - in English, this means “outstanding\nobligations,” a lure craftily designed to catch the attention of unsuspecting law-abiding recipients. DIAN is Colombia’s Directorate of National\nTaxes and Customs - the Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales.\n\n|Tactic|Technique|\n|---|---|\n|Initial Access|T1566.001|\n|Execution|T1204.001, T1204.002, T1059.005, T1059.001, T1059.003|\n|Persistence|T1053.005, T1547.001|\n|Defense Evasion|T1218.009|\n\n|Weapons|PDF for lures, Visual Basic Scripts, .NET Assemblies injected in memory, Malicious DLLs, PowerShell|\n|---|---|\n|Attack Vector|Spear-phishing attachment with PDF|\n|Network Infrastructure|DDNS DuckDNS, Discord, Web Applications|\n|Targets|Entities in Colombia|\n\n\n-----\n\ne ette we a a y ed states t at t e ec p e t s 45 days a ea s w t a ta pay e t, a d te s t e ta get to c c a to v ew t e\ninvoice, which comes in the form of a password-protected PDF. The letter was signed by a (likely fictious) “Roberto Mendoza Ortiz,\n_Department Head.” The phishing email's sender is \"alfredo agudelo moreno agudelomorenoalfredo79[at]gmail[.]com,\" an email address which_\nalso appears to have been be made up specifically for this campaign.\n\nWe also found another email address associated with this campaign – cobrofactura09291[at]gmail[.]com.\n\nThe PDF attached to the phishing email tries to trick the recipient with logos and messages related to the Directorate of National Taxes and\nCustoms. APT-C-36 has regularly used DIAN in their spear-phishing lures over the years, presumably hoping that their targets’ wish to\nmaintain in good standing with the tax authorities would override any natural caution they may have when opening emails sent from an\nunfamiliar email address.\n\nThe PDF contains a URL different from the legitimate hyperlink to DIAN’s website, which is https://www.dian.gov.co/. The URL shown is the\nreal one; however, if the user clicks on it, they are redirected to a different website. Finally, the URL field of this new site contains a URL which\ndownloads a second-stage payload from the public service Discord.\n\nBelow is the full intrusion attempt shown step-by-step:\n\n_Figure 1: Attack flow of Blind Eagle’s campaign analyzed_\n\n### Attack Vector\n\n|Hashes (md5, sha-256)|e4d2799f3001a531d15939b1898399b4 fc85d3da6401b0764a2e8a5f55334a7d683ec20fb8210213feb6148f02a30554|\n|---|---|\n|File name|Fv3608799004720042L900483000P19878099700001537012.pdf|\n|File Size|507436 bytes|\n|Created|2023:01:25 10:07:03-05:00|\n|Author|Dirección De Aduanas Nacionales Calle 23 # 157-25 la|\n|Last Modified|2023:01:25 10:07:03-05:00|\n\n\n-----\n\n**DocumentID** uuid:9585FD65-6D08-453D-9E4A-51155AD12748\n\n### What is the DIAN?\n\nThe [Directorate of National Taxes and Customs is an entity attached to the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit. The DIAN is organized as a](https://www.dian.gov.co/dian/entidad/Paginas/Presentacion.aspx)\nSpecial Administrative Unit of the national order. Its purpose is to help guarantee the fiscal security of the Colombian State and the protection\nof the national economic public order through the administration and control of due compliance with tax, customs, and exchange obligations.\nThe jurisdiction of the DIAN includes the national territory. It is headquartered in Bogotá, the Capital of Colombia.\n\n### Weaponization\n\nBlind Eagle carefully targets its victims with spear-phishing emails, in a similar fashion to other campaigns by the group. It entices its targets to\nclick links contained in the body of the email, or to download a malicious PDF file, which purports to contain information about overdue taxes.\n\nThe URL shown on the bait document masquerades as the actual domain of DIAN. However, when clicked, the hyperlink leads to another\ndomain created entirely by the threat actor using the public service website[.]org. The link redirects the target to dian.server[.]tl. This crafty\n[technique is known as URL phishing.](https://surfshark.com/blog/what-is-url-phishing)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Content of the bait email, masquerading as the Directorate of National Taxes and Customs_\n\nIn English, the bait document reads:\n\n\n-----\n\nDear taxpayer,\n\nAt DIAN we maintain our commitment to provide you with the necessary assistance and services so that you can comply in a timely and\ncorrect manner with your tax obligations.\n\nFor this reason, we remind you that you are in arrears with your obligations. for an amount owed of THREE MILLION TWO HUNDRED\nFIFTY-TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY PESOS, with 45 days in arrears due to the lack of commitment in your financial\nobligations regulated in law 0248 of the year 2005 numeral 12.\n\nNext, we put at your disposal the Virtual PDF with all the details of your obligations generated to date.\n\n**Submit a foreclosure process and pay on time.**\n\n_In the following link you will find the invoice in PDF format._\n\nTo view the document, enter the password: A2023\n\n_Cordially,_\n\n_ROBERTO MENDOZA ORTIZ_\n\n_Department Head_\n\nWhen the victim clicks on the masked link in the email, they are redirected to dian.server[.]tl. The threat actor carefully crafted this webpage to\ndeceive the victim into believing they are interacting with the real DIAN.\n\n_Figure 3: Content presented to the user on the fake webpage dian.server[.]tl_\n\nLooking at the code of the webpage, the content presented to the users is loaded from website[.]org/s8Xwt2 or website[.]org/render/s8Xwt2,\nand not from dian.server[.]tl. This is accomplished by using an iframe resized to the 100% of the screen.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: The content the victim sees is shown on the left, which is loaded from the resource shown on the right_\n\nThe fake DIAN website page contains a button that encourages the victim to download a PDF to view what the site claims to be pending tax\ninvoices. Clicking the blue button initiates the download of a malicious file from the Discord content delivery network (CDN), which the\nattackers are abusing in this phishing scam.\n\nhxxps://cdn.discordapp[.]com/attachments/1067819339090243727/1071063499494666240/Asuntos_DIAN_N34000137L287004P08899\n03-02-2023-pdf[.]uue\nhxxps://cdn.discordapp[.]com/attachments/1066009888083431506/1070342535702130759/Asuntos_DIAN_N6440005403992837L2088\n01-02-2023-pdf[.]uue\nhxxps://cdn.discordapp[.]com/attachments/1072851594812600351/1072851643583967272/Asuntos_DIAN_N3663000227L28700000024\n08-02-2023-pdf[.]uue\n\nThe downloaded file tries to trick the user into manually adding the word “pdf” at the end of the filename. However, the real extension is\nactually “uue.” This is a file extension WinRAR opens by default.

The compressed .uue file contains yet another file\ninside it.

A copy of itself\nis first created under C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\MRR.exe.\n\n_Figure 20: Creation of MRR in AppData folder_\n\n1.   If the user who executed it was an admin, then AsyncRAT can create a scheduled task using the process schtasks.exe, with the following\ncommand line:\n\na.   \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\" /c schtasks /create /f /sc onlogon /rl highest /tn \"MRR\" /tr '\"C:\\Users\\\n<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\MRR.exe\"' & exit'\n\n_Figure 21: Execution of schtasks.exe via cmd.exe_\n\n_Figure 22: Command line executed to create scheduled task and run AsyncRAT_\n\n2.

Initially, the IP that resolves the\ndomain was a VPN/Proxy service 46.246.86[.]3. While conducting the investigation, we discovered another IP with the same purpose,\n46.246.12[.]6.\n\n**Entity** **Value** **Description**\n\n\n-----\n\nDomain asy1543.duckdns[.]org:1543 Final AsyncRAT payload communication domain\n\nIP 46.246.86[.]3 Resolution of the DuckDNS domain\n\nIP 46.246.12[.]6 Resolution of the DuckDNS domain\n\nURL hxxp://172.174.176[.]153/ Web application hosting payloads used during the infection\n\nIP 172.174.176[.]153 IP of the web application hosting payloads used during the infection\n\nBlind Eagle/ APT-C-36 uses Dynamic DNS (DDNS) services, such as DuckDNS, for most campaigns to connect its implemented RATs to the\ninfrastructure they control to send and receive commands. DuckDNS additionally allows for high IP resolution rotation and the launch of new\nsubdomains under this well-known DDNS\n\nThe application web hosted under hxxp://172.174.176[.]153/ had two main directories where it stored information to be used during the\nintrusion as the user downloads and executes files.\n\nThe first directory was hxxp://172.174.176[.]153/dll/, storing several DLLs used during the intrusion.\n\n_Figure 28: Index of APT-C-36's /dll directory_\n\nAnother directory is found at hxxp://172.174.176[.]153/rump/ and stores another DLL, in this case, related to Fsociety:\n\n_Figure 29: index of /rump directory_\n\n### Targets\n\nBlind Eagle/ APT-C-36's targets include health, public, financial, judiciary, and law enforcement entities in Colombia.\n\nAmong the countries where we have seen Blind Eagle activity in the last few months, specifically distributing the UUE file types with different\nthemes include:\n\n|IP|46.246.86[.]3|Resolution of the DuckDNS domain|\n|---|---|---|\n|IP|46.246.12[.]6|Resolution of the DuckDNS domain|\n|URL|hxxp://172.174.176[.]153/|Web application hosting payloads used during the infection|\n|IP|172.174.176[.]153|IP of the web application hosting payloads used during the infection|\n\n\n-----\n\nCo o b a\nEcuador\nChile\nSpain\n\nThis is consistent with the use of the Spanish language in the group’s spear-phishing emails. Most countries in South America use Spanish\n(apart from Brazil), which matches the threat actor’s locale and the names in the bait document.\n\n### Attribution\n\nAPT-C-36 is a South American-based threat actor active since at least 2019. The group continues to concentrate its operations within a\nHispanic geographic region, with its main targets being government institutions and other organizations primarily based in Colombia.\n\nThe use of specific tools and artifacts, along with the type and configuration of the network infrastructure documented in this report, combined\nwith the tactics, techniques & procedures (TTPs) used to deploy them, all closely align with previously attributed campaigns by this group.\n\nThat, coupled with the geolocation and nature of the targets seen in this campaign, leads us to ascertain, at the very least, a moderate level of\nconfidence that this campaign was conducted by APT-C-36.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThis campaign continues to operate for the purposes of information theft and espionage. The modus operandi used has mostly stayed the same\nas the group’s previous efforts – it is very simple, which may mean that this group is comfortable with its way of launching campaigns via\nphishing emails, and feels confident in using them because they continue to work.\n\nOver the next few months, we will likely continue to see new targets for this group, using new ways to deceive their victims.\n\n### APPENDIX 1 - Applied Countermeasures\n\n**Yara Rules**\n\nrule targeted_BlindEagle_Loader : Fsociety\n\n{\nmeta:\n\ndescription = \"Rule to detect BlindEagle malicious Loader\"\n\nauthor = \"The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence team\"\n\ndate = \"2023-02-07\"\n\nlast_modified = \"2023-02-22\"\n\ndistribution = \"TLP:White\"\n\nversion = \"1.0\"\n\nstrings:\n\n$h0 =\n{6449640053697A655F00526573657276656431004465736B746F70005469746C65006477580064775900647758536\n\n97A650064775953697A6500647758436F756E74436861727300647759436F756E74436861727300647746696C6C41747472}\n\n$h1 =\n{000004200101022901002434353136453045312D354330452D344234452D394133322D39453337453233453734323600000C01000731\n\n2E302E302E3000004901001A2E4E45544672616D65776F726B2C5665}\n\ncondition:\n\nuint16(0) == 0x5A4D and filesize < 100KB and 1 of ($h*)\n\n}\n\n**_Disclaimer: The private version of this report is available upon request.
