Additional_**\n**_information may be found in a_** **_[statement from the White House. For more information on SolarWinds-related activity, go to](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-activities-by-the-russian-government/)_**\n**_[https://us-cert.cisa.gov/remediating-apt-compromised-networks and](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/remediating-apt-compromised-networks)_** **_[https://www.cisa.gov/supply-chain-compromise.](https://www.cisa.gov/supply-chain-compromise)_**\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is aware of compromises of U.S. government agencies, critical infrastructure\nentities, and private sector organizations by an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor beginning in at least March 2020. This APT actor has\ndemonstrated patience, operational security, and complex tradecraft in these intrusions. CISA expects that removing this threat actor from\ncompromised environments will be highly complex and challenging for organizations.\n\n(Updated January 6, 2021): One of the initial access vectors for this activity is a supply chain compromise of a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) in\nthe following SolarWinds Orion products (see Appendix A). Note: prior versions of this Alert included a single bullet that listed two platform\nversions for the same DLL. For clarity, the Alert now lists these platform versions that share the same DLL version number separately, as both\nare considered affected versions.\n\nOrion Platform 2019.4 HF5, version 2019.4.5200.9083\nOrion Platform 2020.2 RC1, version 2020.2.100.12219\nOrion Platform 2020.2 RC2, version 2020.2.5200.12394\nOrion Platform 2020.2, version 2020.2.5300.12432\nOrion Platform 2020.2 HF1, version 2020.2.5300.12432\n\n**Note (updated January 6, 2021): CISA has evidence that there are initial access vectors other than the SolarWinds Orion platform and has**\nidentified legitimate account abuse as one of these vectors (for details refer to Initial Access Vectors section). Specifically, we are investigating\nincidents in which activity indicating abuse of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) tokens consistent with this adversary’s behavior is\npresent, yet where impacted SolarWinds instances have not been identified. CISA is continuing to work to confirm initial access vectors and\nidentify any changes to the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). CISA will update this Alert as new information becomes available.\nRefer to [CISA.gov/supply-chain-compromise for additional resources.](https://www.cisa.gov/supply-chain-compromise)\n\n(Updated January 6, 2021): On December 13, 2020, CISA released Emergency Directive 21-01: Mitigate SolarWinds Orion Code\nCompromise, ordering federal civilian executive branch departments and agencies to disconnect affected devices. CISA has subsequently\nissued [supplemental guidance to Emergency Directive (ED) 21-01, most recently on January 6, 2021. Note: this Activity Alert does not](https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/#supplemental-guidance-v3)\nsupersede the requirements of ED 21-01 or any supplemental guidance and does not represent formal guidance to federal agencies under ED\n21-01.\n\nCISA has determined that this threat poses a grave risk to the Federal Government and state, local, tribal, and territorial governments as well\nas critical infrastructure entities and other private sector organizations. CISA advises stakeholders to read this Alert and review the enclosed\nindicators (see Appendix B).\n\n**Key Takeaways (updated December 18, 2020)**\n\nThis is a patient, well-resourced, and focused adversary that has sustained long duration activity on victim networks.\nCISA is investigating other initial access vectors in addition to the SolarWinds Orion supply chain compromise.\nNot all organizations that have the backdoor delivered through SolarWinds Orion have been targeted by the adversary with follow-on\nactions.\nOrganizations with suspected compromises need to be highly conscious of operational security, including when engaging in incident\nresponse activities and planning and implementing remediation plans.\n\n[(Updated January 8, 2021) For a downloadable list of indicators of compromise (IOCs), see the STIX file.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA20-352A.stix.xml)\n\n_(Updated April 15, 2021) See the following Malware Analysis Reports (MARs) for additional technical details and associated IOCs:_\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**Overview**\n\nCISA is aware of compromises, which began at least as early as March 2020, at U.S. government agencies, critical infrastructure entities, and\nprivate sector organizations by an APT actor. This threat actor has demonstrated sophistication and complex tradecraft in these intrusions.\nCISA expects that removing the threat actor from compromised environments will be highly complex and challenging.

CISA will continue to update this Alert and the corresponding\nIOCs as new information becomes available.\n\n**[Initial Infection Vectors [TA0001]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v8/tactics/TA0001/)**\n\n(Updated January 6, 2021): CISA is investigating incidents that exhibit adversary TTPs consistent with this activity, including some where\nvictims either do not leverage SolarWinds Orion or where SolarWinds Orion was present but where there was no SolarWinds exploitation\nactivity observed. CISA incident response investigations have identified that initial access in some cases was obtained by password guessing\n\n[[T1101.001], password spraying [T1101.003], and inappropriately secured administrative credentials [T1078] accessible via external remote](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v8/techniques/T1110/001/)\n[access services [T1133]. Initial access root cause analysis is still ongoing in a number of response activities and CISA will update this section](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v8/techniques/T1133/)\nas additional initial vectors are identified.\n\nVolexity has also reported publicly that they observed the APT using a secret key that the APT previously stole in order to generate a cookie to\n[bypass the Duo multi-factor authentication (MFA) protecting access to Outlook Web App (OWA).[1] Volexity attributes this intrusion to the same](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2020/12/14/dark-halo-leverages-solarwinds-compromise-to-breach-organizations/)\nactivity as the SolarWinds Orion supply chain compromise, and the TTPs are consistent between the two. This observation indicates that there\nare other initial access vectors beyond SolarWinds Orion, and there may still be others that are not yet known.\n\n**[SolarWinds Orion Supply Chain Compromise [T1195.002]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v8/techniques/T1195/002/)**\n\nSolarWinds Orion is an enterprise network management software suite that includes performance and application monitoring and network\nconfiguration management along with several different types of analyzing tools. SolarWinds Orion is used to monitor and manage on-premise\nand hosted infrastructures. To provide SolarWinds Orion with the necessary visibility into this diverse set of technologies, it is common for\nnetwork administrators to configure SolarWinds Orion with pervasive privileges, making it a valuable target for adversary activity.\n\n[The threat actor has been observed leveraging a software supply chain compromise of SolarWinds Orion products[2] (see Appendix A). The](https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory)\nadversary added a malicious version of the binary `solarwinds.orion.core.businesslayer.dll into the SolarWinds software lifecycle,`\nwhich was then signed by the legitimate SolarWinds code signing certificate. This binary, once installed, calls out to a victim-specific\n```\navsvmcloud[.]com domain using a protocol designed to mimic legitimate SolarWinds protocol traffic. After the initial check-in, the adversary\n\n```\ncan use the Domain Name System (DNS) response to selectively send back new domains or IP addresses for interactive command and\ncontrol (C2) traffic. Consequently, entities that observe traffic from their SolarWinds Orion devices to `avsvmcloud[.]com should not`\nimmediately conclude that the adversary leveraged the SolarWinds Orion backdoor. Instead, additional investigation is needed into whether\nthe SolarWinds Orion device engaged in further unexplained communications. If additional Canonical Name record (CNAME) resolutions\nassociated with the `avsvmcloud[.]com domain are observed, possible additional adversary action leveraging the backdoor has occurred.`\n\nBased on coordinated actions by multiple private sector partners, as of December 15, 2020, `avsvmcloud[.]com resolves to`\n```\n20.140.0[.]1, which is an IP address on the Microsoft blocklist. This negates any future use of the implants and would have caused\n\n```\ncommunications with this domain to cease. In the case of infections where the attacker has already moved C2 past the initial beacon, infection\nwill likely continue notwithstanding this action.\n\nSolarWinds Orion typically leverages a significant number of highly privileged accounts and access to perform normal business functions.\nSuccessful compromise of one of these systems can therefore enable further action and privileges in any environment where these accounts\nare trusted.\n\n**Anti-Forensic Techniques**\n\nThe adversary is making extensive use of obfuscation to hide their C2 communications. The adversary is using virtual private servers (VPSs),\noften with IP addresses in the home country of the victim, for most communications to hide their activity among legitimate user traffic. The\nattackers also frequently rotate their “last mile” IP addresses to different endpoints to obscure their activity and avoid detection.\n\n[FireEye has reported that the adversary is using steganography (Obfuscated Files or Information: Steganography [T1027.003]) to obscure C2](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v8/techniques/T1027/003/)\n[communications.[3] This technique negates many common defensive capabilities in detecting the activity. Note: CISA has not yet been able to](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\nindependently confirm the adversary’s use of this technique.\n\nAccording to FireEye, the malware also checks for a list of hard-coded IPv4 and IPv6 addresses—including RFC-reserved IPv4 and IPv6 IP—\nin an attempt to detect if the malware is executed in an analysis environment (e.g., a malware analysis sandbox); if so, the malware will stop\nfurther execution. Additionally, FireEye analysis identified that the backdoor implemented time threshold checks to ensure that there are\nunpredictable delays between C2 communication attempts, further frustrating traditional network-based analysis.\n\nWhile not a full anti-forensic technique, the adversary is heavily leveraging compromised or spoofed tokens for accounts for lateral movement.\nThis will frustrate commonly used detection techniques in many environments. Since valid, but unauthorized, security tokens and accounts are\nutilized, detecting this activity will require the maturity to identify actions that are outside of a user’s normal duties. For example, it is unlikely\nthat an account associated with the HR department would need to access the cyber threat intelligence database.\n\nTaken together, these observed techniques indicate an adversary who is skilled, stealthy with operational security, and is willing to expend\nsignificant resources to maintain covert presence.\n\n**[Privilege Escalation and Persistence [TA0004,](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v8/tactics/TA0004)** **[TA0003]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v8/tactics/TA0003/)**\n\n\n-----\n\n(Updated Ja ua y 6, _0_ ) e ad e sa y as bee obse ed us g u t p e pe s ste ce ec a s s ac oss a a ety o t us o s C S as\nobserved the threat actor adding authentication credentials, in the form of assigning tokens and certificates, to existing Azure/Microsoft 365\n(M365) application service principals. These additional credentials provide persistence and escalation mechanisms and a programmatic\nmethod of interacting with the Microsoft Cloud tenants (often with Microsoft Graph Application Programming Interface [API]) to access hosted\nresources without significant evidence or telemetry being generated.\n\n(Updated January 6, 2021): Microsoft reported that the actor has added new federation trusts to existing on-premises infrastructure, a\ntechnique that CISA believes was utilized by a threat actor in an incident to which CISA has responded. Where this technique is used, it is\npossible that authentication can occur outside of an organization’s known infrastructure and may not be visible to the legitimate system owner.\nMicrosoft has released a query to help identify this activity, as well as a Sentinel detection for identifying changes to the identity federation from\n[a user or application.[4]](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Detections/AuditLogs/ADFSDomainTrustMods.yaml%20)\n\n**User Impersonation**\n\n(Updated January 6, 2021): The adversary’s initial objectives, as understood today, appear to be to collect information from victim\nenvironments. One method the adversary is accomplishing this objective is by compromising the SAML signing certificate using their escalated\nActive Directory privileges. Once this is accomplished, the adversary creates unauthorized but valid tokens and presents them to services that\ntrust SAML tokens from the environment. These tokens can then be used to access resources in hosted environments, such as email, for data\nexfiltration via authorized APIs. During the persistence phase, the additional credentials being attached to service principals obfuscates the\nactivity of user objects, because they appear to be accessed by the individual, and such individual access is normal and not logged in all M365\nlicensing levels.\n\nCISA has observed in its incident response work adversaries targeting email accounts belonging to key personnel, including IT and incident\nresponse personnel.\n\nThese are some key functions and systems that commonly use SAML.\n\nHosted email services\nHosted business intelligence applications\nTravel systems\nTimecard systems\nFile storage services (such as SharePoint and OneDrive)\n\n**(New January 6, 2021): Detection: Identifying Compromised Azure/M365 Resources**\n\n[CISA created Sparrow.ps1[5] to help detect possible compromised accounts and applications in the Azure/M365 environment. Sparrow is](https://github.com/cisagov/Sparrow)\nintended for use by incident responders and focuses on the narrow scope of user and application activity endemic to identity- and\nauthentication-based attacks seen recently in multiple sectors. It is neither comprehensive nor exhaustive of available data and is intended to\nnarrow a larger set of available investigation modules and telemetry to those specific to recent intrusions on federated identity sources and\n[applications. Sparrow can be found on CISA’s GitHub page at https://github.com/cisagov/Sparrow.](https://github.com/cisagov/Sparrow)\n\n**Detection: Impossible Logins**\n\nThe adversary is using a complex network of IP addresses to obscure their activity, which can result in a detection opportunity referred to as\n“impossible travel.” Impossible travel occurs when a user logs in from multiple IP addresses that are a significant geographic distance apart\n(i.e., a person could not realistically travel between the geographic locations of the two IP addresses during the time period between the\nlogins). Note: implementing this detection opportunity can result in false positives if legitimate users apply virtual private network (VPN)\nsolutions before connecting into networks.\n\n**Detection: Impossible Tokens**\n\nThe following conditions may indicate adversary activity.\n\n(Updated January 6, 2021): Most organizations have SAML tokens with 1-hour validity periods. Long SAML token validity durations, such\nas 24 hours, could be unusual. Exact values (measured in precise seconds) is also considered unusual.\nThe SAML token contains different timestamps, including the time it was issued and the last time it was used. A token having the same\ntimestamp for when it was issued and when it was used is not indicative of normal user behavior as users tend to use the token within a\nfew seconds but not at the exact same time of issuance.\nA token that does not have an associated login with its user account within an hour of the token being generated also warrants\ninvestigation.\n(New January 6, 2021): Tokens with missing or unusual MFA details, when MFA is enforced, is considered an anomaly and should be\ninvestigated. This requires correlation of identity provider (iDP) logs with cloud access; differences in claims indicate manipulated values.\nAll claims should have a corresponding iDP entry.\n\n[(New December 21, 2020): see the National Security Agency (NSA) Cybersecurity Advisory: Detecting Abuse of Authentication Mechanisms](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/17/2002554125/-1/-1/0/AUTHENTICATION_MECHANISMS_CSA_U_OO_198854_20.PDF)\nfor additional detection methods as well as mitigation recommendations.\n\n**Operational Security**\n\n\n-----\n\nue to t e atu e o t s patte o ad e sa y act ty a d t e ta get g o ey pe so e, c de t espo se sta, a d e a accou ts\ndiscussion of findings and mitigations should be considered very sensitive, and should be protected by operational security measures.

(Note: for the purposes of mitigation analysis, a\nnetwork is defined as any computer network with hosts that share either a logical trust or any account credentials with SolarWinds Orion.)\n\n**Category 1 includes those who do not have the identified malicious binary code on their network and can forensically confirm that the**\nbinary was never present on their systems. This includes networks that do not, and never did, utilize the affected versions of SolarWinds\nOrion products (see Appendix A).\n**Category 2 includes networks where the presence of the malicious binary has been identified—with or without beaconing to**\n```\n   avsvmcloud[.]com . This includes networks that previously utilized affected versions of SolarWinds Orion but where the organization\n\n```\nhas forensically verified (through comprehensive network monitoring and analysis) that platforms running the affected software either:\n\n1. Had no beaconing, or\n2. Only beaconed to `avsvmcloud[.]com and have not had any secondary C2 activity to a separate domain or IP address or other`\n\n[adversary activity or secondary actions on objectives (AOOs),[6] such as SAML token abuse.](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/Seven_Ways_to_Apply_the_Cyber_Kill_Chain_with_a_Threat_Intelligence_Platform.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nCatego y o ga at o s, a te co duct g app op ate o e s c a a ys s to e su e t ey o y a e Catego y act ty, ca ebu d t e\nplatform, harden the configuration based on SolarWinds secure configuration guidelines, and resume use as determined by and\nconsistent with their thorough risk evaluation. For entities not subject to ED 21-01, this can be accomplished by following the steps below.\nFederal agencies subject to ED 21-01 must follow the appropriate steps as outlined in the effective ED 21-01 supplemental guidance.\n\n1. Denying all incoming and outgoing ( any:any ) communications outside of the organization’s device network management enclave,\n\nwith additional assurance that communications to the public internet to and from hosts running SolarWinds Orion products has\nbeen blocked.\n2. Cloud instances of Orion should only monitor cloud resources in that cloud infrastructure.\n3. On-premises instances of Orion should not be permissioned with any cloud/hosted identity accounts.\n4. Restoration of SolarWinds may be done from the legacy database following the SolarWinds restore guidance\n\n[(http://solarwinds.com/upgrading-your-environment). Restoration for affected versions will differ from restoration for unaffected](http://solarwinds.com/upgrading-your-environment)\nversions—agencies must ensure that they are following the correct restoration guidance.\n5. Before building SolarWinds:\n\n1. All account credentials, or other shared secrets (e.g., Simple Network Management Protocol [SNMP] strings) that are or had\n\nbeen utilized by the affected SolarWinds Orion device being rebuilt should be changed.\n2. Enable MFA for these credentials, whenever possible.\n3. Provide service accounts with the minimum privilege necessary for the role performed, whenever possible.\n4. For accounts where MFA is not possible (e.g., service accounts), use randomly generated long and complex passwords\n\n(greater than 25 characters) and implement a maximum 90-day rotation policy for these passwords.\n5. Remove all inbound trust relationships to the SolarWinds Orion device being rebuilt.\n6. Re-building a SolarWinds Orion Platform to at least version 2020.2.1 HF2 and updating the host to the latest supported build, at\n\nleast Windows 2016.\n7. Following the SolarWinds secure configuration (hardening) guidelines provided by the vendor, which can be found at:\n\n[https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/orionplatform/content/core-secure-configuration.htm. CISA does not](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/orionplatform/content/core-secure-configuration.htm)\nrecommend configuring the SolarWinds software to implement SAML-based authentication that relies on Microsoft’s Active\nDirectory Federated Services if it has not already been configured to leverage SAML. This configuration is currently being exploited\nby the threat actor with this activity.\n8. Configuring logging to ensure that all logs on the host operating system and SolarWinds platform are being captured and stored for\n\nat least 180 days.\n9. Configure logging to ensure that all logs from the host OS, SolarWinds platform, and associated network logs are being captured\n\nand stored for at least 180 days in a separate, centralized log aggregation capability.\n10. Implementing subsequent SolarWinds Orion Platform updates. CISA recommends installing all updates within 48 hours of release.\n\n**Category 3 includes those networks that used affected versions of SolarWinds Orion and have evidence of follow-on threat actor activity,**\nsuch as binary beaconing to `avsvmcloud[.]com and secondary C2 activity to a separate domain or IP address (typically but not`\nexclusively returned in `avsvmcloud[.]com CNAME responses). Additionally, organizations that have observed communications with`\n```\n   avsvmcloud[.]com that appear to suddenly cease prior to December 14, 2020—not due to an action taken by their network defenders\n\n```\n—fall into this category. Assume the environment has been compromised, and initiate incident response procedures immediately.\nRecovery and remediation of Category 3 activity requires a complex reconstitution and mitigation plan, which may include\ncomprehensively rebuilding the environment. This should be coordinated with an organization’s leadership and incident response team.\n\nCompromise Mitigations\n\n(Updated January 6, 2021): If the adversary has compromised administrative level credentials in an environment—or if organizations identify\nSAML abuse in the environment, simply mitigating individual issues, systems, servers, or specific user accounts will likely not lead to the\nadversary’s removal from the network. In such cases, organizations should consider the entire identity trust store as compromised. In the event\nof a total identity compromise, a full reconstitution of identity and trust services is required to successfully remediate. In this reconstitution, it\nbears repeating that this threat actor is among the most capable, and in many cases, a full rebuild of the environment is the safest action. A\n[Microsoft blog post, Advice for incident responders on recovery from systemic identity compromises outlines processes and procedures](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/12/21/advice-for-incident-responders-on-recovery-from-systemic-identity-compromises/)\nneeded to remediate this type of activity and retain administrative control of an environment. In addition to the recommendations in this blog\npost, CISA recommends the following actions:\n\n\n-----\n\na e act o s to e ed ate e be oast g, c ud g, as ecessa y o app op ate, e gag g t a 3 d pa ty t e pe e ce e ad cat g\nAPTs from enterprise networks.

Change all account credentials, or other shared secrets (e.g., SNMP strings) that were potentially exposed:\n\n1. Enable MFA for these credentials, whenever possible;\n2. Provide service accounts with the minimum level of privilege necessary for the role performed, whenever possible; and\n3. For accounts where MFA is not possible, require use of randomly generated long and complex passwords (greater than 25\n\ncharacters) and implement a maximum 90-day rotation policy for these passwords.\n3.
