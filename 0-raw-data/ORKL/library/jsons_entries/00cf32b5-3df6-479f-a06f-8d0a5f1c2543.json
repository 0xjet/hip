[BlackBerry Blog](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en.html)\n2. Threat Thursday: China-Based APT Plays Auto-Updater Card to Deliver WinDealer\n\nMalware\n\nAuto-updaters can help close the door on known attacks and security vulnerabilities by\nallowing software vendors to patch their own wares automatically. But recently, threat actors\nfrom the [LuoYu group have been turning this commonly used feature into a weapon to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-luoyu-hackers-deploy-cyber-espionage-malware-via-app-updates/)\ncompromise victims’ machines.\n\nThese attackers have been using a technique mentioned in documents leaked by famed\nNSA defector Edward Snowden, called Quantum Insert or Man-on-the-Side (MotS) attacks.\n[These are used in conjunction with watering-hole attacks on popular Android messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watering_hole_attack)\napps to deploy malware, including WinDealer.\n\n\n-----\n\nAttacks such as the ones we ll describe in this post have recently been observed in East\nAsia, but the threat group LuoYu has broadened its focus to hit Chinese-speaking targets in\nother countries as well, with the apparent motive of stealing dissident information.\n\n### Operating System\n\n Risk & Impact\n\n LuoYu Threat Group Background\n\nLuoYu is a sophisticated APT group linked to China, which has been active since 2008.\n[First discovered and christened by researchers at teamT5, LuoYu’s malicious activities and](https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2021/pdf/JSAC2021_301_shui-leon_en.pdf)\ncampaigns have been primarily confined to Eastern Asia. The group’s previous targets have\nincluded Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China.\n\nAccording to teamT5, China has been the group’s primary theater of operation, with the\napparent goal of targeting Chinese dissidents through messaging applications. This group\nhas also attacked Chinese-speaking victims in the United States, Russia, and Europe.\nLuoYu initially focused its attacks on the technology, media, and education sectors of China\nand Eastern Asia, but has since branched out to other industries including financial,\ngovernment, military, telecommunications, and logistics sectors.\n\nIn 2019, [Fortinet highlighted a new campaign against a U.S.-hosted Chinese-language](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/chinese-targeted-trojan-analysis)\nnews site by a (then-unnamed) threat group. The backdoor application used in that\ncampaign was named “PPTV(pplive)_forap_1084_9333.exe.” This exact same file,\ncombined with the same filename and hosting, was also present in recent research\n[published by Kaspersky, which identifies the threat as WinDealer and names LuoYu as the](https://securelist.com/windealer-dealing-on-the-side/105946/)\nthreat actor responsible for delivering the malware. The presence of the same file, filename,\nhosting, and the similar nature of the target likely indicates that LuoYu was behind the\nearlier Chinese news site attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nLuoYu currently deploys several different types of malware via a number of different\nmethods. The group also deploys Demsty and SpyDealer, which are information stealers,\nby using watering-hole attacks. A watering-hole attack targets a specific group of users by\ninfecting websites that members of the group are known to visit, or which the threat group\nhas observed them visiting by covert means. For example, it’s an easy guess that\nemployees of any company are likely to visit their own organization’s website most often,\nand periodically those of their competitors. These websites are then compromised via zeroday vulnerabilities on browsers or other software.\n\nLuoYu’s watering hole attacks use compromised news sites and malicious versions of\npopular Android messaging applications like WeChat, WhatsApp, QQ, and Weibo. These\ntactics were employed in 2019, exploiting interest in protests over the Hong Kong antiextradition bill to steal information from suspected dissidents.\n\nOther [researchers have been dutifully following LuoYu’s use of the MotS technique to](https://securelist.com/windealer-dealing-on-the-side/105946/)\ndeliver WinDealer malware. Our purpose in this post is to analyze the latest iteration of\nWinDealer malware, and its notable addition of a new infection vector.\n\n### New Attack Vector\n\nLuoYu can now target the automatic update functionality of legitimate applications, using\nMotS attack techniques. Unlike a Man-in-the-Middle attack (MitM) attack, where an attacker\nis positioned as a node between the client connection and its destination, MotS gives an\nattacker direct control of the response from both client and server, allowing the threat actor\nto directly modify the information requested or sent, and to delete messages or deny\nresponses entirely. The difference between the two attack methods lies in how the attacker\ncontrols the flow of information.\n\nIn a MotS attack, the attacker only has access to see and read the communication channel,\nbut no ability to modify or deletepackets sent between server and client. The goal of this\ntechnique is to send messages in the communication channel before a legitimate response\nfrom the server is returned. The attacker must get the timing exactly right to beat the\nlegitimate server response.\n\nThis is where auto-updaters come in. Auto-updaters tend to make a lot of requests to\nservers, to check if there are any new updates to their host’s software. These types of\napplications would provide an attacker with many opportunities to win “the race” in getting\ncompromised messages back to the client. This could explain why automatic updaters are a\npopular target.\n\n[A MotS attack is also known as a Quantum Insert. This term was used in documentation](https://theintercept.com/document/2014/03/12/one-way-quantum/)\nfrom the NSA leaked by Edward Snowden in 2014. This attack technique has been in use\nsince 2005.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Technical Analysis\n\nWinDealer requires two portable executable (PE) files to work properly, both of which are\ncarried within the host executable:\n\n**Main Executable (SHA256:**\n08530e8280a93b8a1d51c20647e6be73795ef161e3b16e22e5e23d88ead4e226)\n\nThis does the initial configuration and decrypts the embedded library.\n**Second Executable (SHA256:**\naa7a43b30025e849a9912c873fb0225e8354fc895533fd8136af8379902aea27)\n\nThis file is masked as a bitmap (BMP) image in the resource section, and loaded into\nmemory on the system.\n\nBoth files are used to execute WinDealer’s capabilities, which include the following\nactivities:\n\nFile manipulation\nRegistry manipulation\nTaking screenshots\nProcess enumeration\nCollecting host environment information\nData exfiltration\nKeylogging\nCommand-and-control (C2) backdoor creation\n\nThe main executable is an unpacked, 32-bit Microsoft Visual C++ compiled application. The\nfile itself masquerades as Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, including having the trademarked\nblue lowercase “e” icon and golden ring halo.\n\nCopyright information in the file description lists the copyright as belonging to “Mozille\nDevelopers.” The file itself is not signed. The original filename is listed as “explorer.exe,” as\nshown in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 - Details for the main executable (SHA256:_\n_08530e8280a93b8a1d51c20647e6be73795ef161e3b16e22e5e23d88ead4e226)_\n\nWinDealer begins its execution by querying the user profile of the victim’s machine with the\ngetenv() command. If an environment is found, a hash value is created to uniquely identify\nthe victim.\n\nThis identifier is then used with CreateMutexA as both a named mutex object and a shared\nresource. A mutex is a synchronization object that prevents multiple threads from accessing\nan object at the same time. This is to prevent race conditions such as two threads trying to\nchange data at the same time.\n\nIn addition to the mutex, a unique identifier is also stored in the registry under\n“\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\5.0\\User Agent\\.” This key is used to identify the browser\nto the server host site being accessed.\n\nThe hash value used to identify the victim is in MD5 format. It combines the MAC address,\nphysical drive info, and the username of the system. Creation of this identifier is shown as a\nsnippet from the decompiler in Figure 2, below.\n\nWinDealer achieves persistence by editing the\n“\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\” key on the host’s machine. This registry key\nis loaded when the user logs on to the system and executes the application “firebrow.exe.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThis malware also contains a hard-coded string that indicates which version of Windealer it\nis. The hash in the sample used in this particular analysis is version “18.20.1225.” The last\ntwo numbers represent the creation date; in this case, December 25. The middle number is\nthe two-digit year, 2020. We believe the first number is the iteration of this version of\nWinDealer.\n\n_Figure 2 - Mutex creation and registry key function_\n\nOnce the mutex and persistence mechanisms are set, WinDealer creates three files in the\n“C:\\ProgramData\\” folder. These files are named 1c76cbfe, 923b5fd7, and f46d373b. The\nfiles are used by WinDealer for its C2 configuration. Configuration settings include\nRemoteIP, RemoteDomain, Password, and a Remark variable for the configuration, which\nare shown below in figure 3. Configuration settings received from the server are stored in\nthese files.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 - RemoteIP, Remark, RemoteDomain, and Password configuration_\n\nNext, three folders are created in the “C:\\User\\[hostname]\\Appdata\\Local\\temp\\” directory.\nThe folders—named 8e98-fb8010fb, 070a-cf37dcf5, and 28e4-20a6acec—are used to\nexfiltrate information stolen from the target host.\n\nFolder 8e98-fb8010fb has logs of the directory information for C:/, Program Files(x86),\nOneDrive, Boot, and the Recycle Bin, all stored as text files. Folder 070a-cf37dcf5 contains\n“.S” files that are composed of hex values. At this time, the purpose of the .S files is unclear.\n\nFolder 28e4-20a6acec has files with the extension “.A.” These files are XORed to obfuscate\nthe file contents, using the key “YYYY.” Using a bitwise XOR with the key produces the\ndecrypted contents of the .A files. There are five .A files in this directory, each containing\n\n\n-----\n\nspecific data extracted from the host. Contents of the .A files include the running process\ntree, adapter information, key inputs, disk information, and local area network configuration.\nFigure 4 shows the decrypted output of the process tree file.\n\n_Figure 4 - Decrypted processInfo file with key “YYYY”_\n\nFor the exfiltration of this data to the server, WinDealer uses rand() to generate a random IP\nfor communication. Shown in Figure 5, the function works in the range of 113[.]62[.]0[.]0 –\n113[.]63[.]255[.]255 and 111[.]120[.]0[.]0 – 111[.]123[.]255[.]255 respectively. This IP\naddress is generated when no existing configuration is available.\n\n_Figure 5 - IP snippet of address generator function_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to the IP generation, the sample we used for this analysis also attempted\nconnections with non-existent URLs www[.]microsoftcom and icanhazip[.]com. Included\nwith those DNS queries, there is an IP connection on port 80 via TCP from one of two\naddresses: 104[.]18[.]115[.]97, or 104[.]18[.]114[.]97. There is also a connection to a\nChinese-hosted ISP over port 6999 at 122[.]112[.]245[.]55. Traffic from this communication\nis shown in Figure 6.\n\n_Figure 6 – UDP traffic over 6999 to a Chinese-hosted ISP_\n\nAfter the IP has been generated and the connection is established, WinDealer proceeds to\nexfiltrate data from the host.\n\nThe threat also edits the registry value “\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet\nSettings” ProxyEnable and ProxyServer. Both these keys are used to facilitate a proxy\nconnection from a Windows device.\n\nAfter it has completed this action, the malware begins to extract the victim’s information that\nhas been stored in the files created in AppData\\Local\\Temp. The contents of the .A files are\nXORed, packeted, and sent to the IP address configured by the executable. Figure 7 shows\na list of functions facilitating some of the information extraction, and the target information.\n\n_Figure 7 - GetComputerName, UserProfile, CPU, Kernel32, and network-related function_\n_calls_\n\n\n-----\n\n[The malicious application comes embedded with a DLL that uses a steganography](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2018/02/steganography-useful-for-espionage-malware-and-more)\ntechnique to avoid detection. Steganography is a method of hiding data within another\nmessage or object. In this case, the object is a bitmap image stored in the resource section\nof the executable.\n\nThe bitmap image, which is the embedded DLL, is XOR’d with a 10-byte key. Once\ndecrypted, a call to GetProcAddress, LoadLibraryA, and Virtuallalloc loads the library into\nmemory. The strings for the library loads are built as character arrays and represented in\nhexadecimal to obscure the calls. Figure 8 shows the bitmap .RSRC section, a snapshot of\nthe decompiler call to the function that XORs the library, and a snippet of the function that\nXORs the library.\n\n_Figure 8 - Embedded DLL bitmap and XOR-related functions_\n\nWinDealer uses the executable and DLL in combination to contact its C2 server and\nexfiltrate data. The loaded library is used to steal data and configure access to the host, as\nwell as handling thread creation to exfiltrate data from the victim.\n\nThe decrypted DLL (SHA256:\naa7a43b30025e849a9912c873fb0225e8354fc895533fd8136af8379902aea27) is named\n“MozillaDll.dll” and has three exports: AutoGetSystemInfo, GetConfigInfo, and partInitOpt.\n\nThe AutoGetSytemInfo export facilitates the extraction of information from the victim. This\nfunction searches the victim’s system for the presence of registry keys and configuration\nfiles that are used by popular chat applications. Targeted applications are WeChat,\nWangWang, and Microsoft’s Skype messenger.\n\nThe directory information of the “My Documents” folder and other user-specific contents are\nwritten to the log files for exfiltration as well. Any information found in this folder is written to\nthe appdata\\Local\\Temp directory and sent to the attacker’s remote destination. A side-byside display of disassembly and parent function calls from the decompiler of\nAutoGetSystemInfo are shown in Figure 9.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 - AutoGetSystemInfo snippet showing WeChat and MyDocuments targets (left)_\n_and parent function call (right)_\n\nThe partInitOpt export contains embedded functions for the C2 aspect of the malware. The\ncommands provide the executable with functionality to pull host configuration data to send\nto the attacker. The commands can change session, display any USB drives, monitor the\nsession type, change filenames, and get disk information. This command set is split\nbetween the executable and dropped library, as shown in Figure 10.\n\n_Figure 10 - Command set for C2 functionality, split between the executable and library. The_\n_image on the left is from the executable “explorer.exe,” and on the right is “MozillaDLL.dll”_\n\nThe GetConfigInfo export is used to get the configuration for the malware. Its functionality\nconsists of copying the string data set by the host executable, and setting the configuration\nbased on the information in created config files. The settings can also be configured by an\nactive connection through the C2 aspect of the malware.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWinDealer is Windows-based malware that splits functionality between two executables.\nOne Trojan .EXE handles installation, network configurations, and houses a split section of\nthe C2 commands. The encrypted DLL that is dropped upon execution handles\nconfiguration, plus the bulk of data extraction, as well as the other half of the C2\ncommands. Windealer XORs the stolen data before sending it over a TCP connection via\nport 6999.\n\nThe group behind this threat, LuoYu, uses a MotS attack to deliver WinDealer to any target\nfor which they have access to the communication channel. By targeting auto-update\nprocesses, the group can persist until they succeed in exfiltrating potentially sensitive data\nfrom their target.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis type of attack could become more frequent in the future, as many legitimate\napplications now come with auto-update features enabled by default. This could be a\ntempting target for other sophisticated APT groups that have the patience and timing to\nexecute this type of sophisticated and complex attack.\n\n### Who is Affected?\n\nWinDealer is most commonly deployed to Chinese mainland targets, due to its association\nwith the APT group LuoYu. Occasional infections in other countries, such as the United\nStates, Russia, and India, are also possible. If an infection occurs outside of China, it is\nlikely intended to target Chinese-speaking individuals. Affected sectors include tech, media,\neducation, government, telecom and logistics.\n\n### Mitigation Tips\n\nMonitor IP traffic for a remote terminal session\n[(https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:RemoteTerminalSessionDetection/).](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:RemoteTerminalSessionDetection/)\nMonitor IP traffic for extracted files\n[(https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:FileCarving/).](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:FileCarving/)\nUse a filter for traffic from the generated IP address WinDealer creates, and any\nattempted connections\n[(https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ConnectionAttemptAnalysis/).](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ConnectionAttemptAnalysis/)\n\n### YARA Rule\n\nThe following YARA rule was authored by the BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team to\ncatch the threat described in this document:\n\nrule Windealer_executable{\n\nmeta:\n\ndescription = \"Detects WinDealer Executable\"\n\nauthor = \"BlackBerry Threat Research Team\"\n\ndate = \"2022-06-14\"\n\nlicense = \"This Yara rule is provided under the Apache License 2.0\n(https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and open to any user or organization, as\nlong as you use it under this license and ensure originator credit in any derivative to The\nBlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team\"\n\nstrings:\n\n$s1 = \"28e4-20a6acec\"\n\n$s2 = \"5a7e-42ccdb67\"\n\n$s3 = \"632c-0ef22957\"\n\n$s4 = \"63ae-a20cf808\"\n\n$s5 = \"65ce-731bffbb\"\n\n$a1 = \"remoteip\"\n\n\n-----\n\n$a2 = sessionid\n$a3 = \"remotedomain\"\n$a4 = \"remark\"\n\ncondition:\nuint16(0) == 0x5a4d and 2 of ($s*) and 1 of ($a*)\n}\nrule Windealer_Library{\nmeta:\ndescription = \"Detects WinDealer Loaded DLL\"\nauthor = \"BlackBerry Threat Research Team\"\ndate = \"2022-06-14\"\nlicense = \"This Yara rule is provided under the Apache License 2.0\n(https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and open to any user or organization, as\nlong as you use it under this license and ensure originator credit in any derivative to The\nBlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team\"\n\nstrings:\n$s1 = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Documents\\\\Tencent\\\\QQ\\\\UserDataInfo.ini\"\n$s2 = \"Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Explorer\\\\Shell Folders\"\n$s3 = \"SOFTWARE\\\\SogouInput\\\\red\"\n$s4 = \"SOFTWARE\\\\SogouDesktopBar\"\n$s5 = \"MozillaDll.dll\"\n$s6 = \"Tencent Files\"\n$s7 = \"wangwang\"\n$s8 = \"WeChat Files\"\n$s9 = \"MyDocument\"\n$s10 = \"Skype\"\n$e1 = \"AutoGetSystemInfo\"\n$e2 = \"GetConfigInfo\"\n$e3 = \"partInitOpt\"\ncondition:\nuint16(0) == 0x5a4d and all of them\n}\n\n### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n**Explorer.exe -**\n08530e8280a93b8a1d51c20647e6be73795ef161e3b16e22e5e23d88ead4e226\n\n**MozillaDLL.dll -**\naa7a43b30025e849a9912c873fb0225e8354fc895533fd8136af8379902aea27\n\n### References\n\n[LuoYu: The Eavesdropper Sneaking in on Multiple Platforms (PDF)](https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2021/pdf/JSAC2021_301_shui-leon_en.pdf)\n\n[Malware WinDealer Used by LuoYu Attack Group](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2021/10/windealer.html#2)\n\n\n-----\n\nLuoYu: Continuous Espionage Activities Targeting Japan With the New Version of\nWinDealer in 2021 (PDF)\n\n[WinDealer Dealing on the Side](https://securelist.com/windealer-dealing-on-the-side/105946/)\n\n[Tricky Chinese-Targeted Trojan Bypasses Authentication](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/chinese-targeted-trojan-analysis)\n\n### BlackBerry Assistance\n\nIf you’re battling this malware or a similar threat, you’ve come to the right place, regardless\nof your existing BlackBerry relationship.\n\n[The BlackBerry Incident Response team is made up of world-class consultants dedicated to](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/services/incident-response)\nhandling response and containment services for a wide range of incidents, including\nransomware and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) cases.\n\nWe have a global consulting team standing by to assist you, providing around-the-clock\nsupport where required, as well as local assistance.
