The app claims it can notify the user when anyone](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/covidlock-android-ransomware-walkthrough-and-unlocking-routine)\ninfected with coronavirus is nearby. Another domain, hxxp://coronasafetymask.tk, asks\nusers to install an APK to receive a \"Corona Safety Mask.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 1. Webpage (downloader)\n\n## Overview\n\nApp Name: Corona Safety Mask\n\nPackage: com.coronasafetymask.app\n\nHash: d7d43c0bf6d4828f1545017f34b5b54c\n\nVirus Total: [0/64](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/8a87cfe676d177061c0b3cbb9bdde4cabee0f1af369bbf8e2d9088294ba9d3b1/detection)\n\n## Technical Description\n\nOnce the user installs the app, it asks for permission to read contacts and send SMS\nmessages. This is a huge red flag for the user to immediately discard the app.\n\nThe screenshot below shows this functionality:\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 2: Initial activities\n\nIf the app is installed, it asks the user to click a button that leads to an online portal\nresponsible for selling masks online. There's the threat that the malware could ask the\nvictim to pay online for the mask and steal the credit card information, but we did not\nfind any such functionality in the app. We believe the app is in its early stages and this (and\nother) functionalities will be added as the app is updated.\n\nThe app simply opens an online portal in the default browser.\n\nFig. 3: URL\n\nAlong with all the above activities, an important functionality takes place behind the scenes.\nThe app checks whether it has already sent SMS messages or not. If it has not, it collects\nall the victim's contacts, as shown in screenshot below :\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 4: Initial checks before sending SMS\n\nOnce all the contacts are collected by the app, it sends SMS messages to all the contacts\nwith a download link in an effort to spread itself to more users. The screenshot below\nshows sendTextMessage, anAndroid function to send out SMS messages to all contacts.\n\nFig. 5: SMS sending functionality\n\nWe allowed the app to dynamically run in a controlled environment. The screenshot below\nshows how the received SMS message appears. It states:\n\n\"Get safety from corona virus by using Face mask, click on this link download the app\n_and order your own face mask - hxxp://coronasafetymask.tk\"_\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 6: SMS received with download link\n\nBy sending itself to a victim's contact list, this malicious app aims to spread itself over and\nover (which can result in hefty usage charges for victims).\n\n## Conclusion\n\n[As we mentioned in a previous post, attackers are going to take every opportunity to](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/covidlock-android-ransomware-walkthrough-and-unlocking-routine)\nvictimize users. During the coronavirus outbreak, it's important to protect yourself online just\nas it's important to protect your health.\n\nThe precautions you take online have been covered extensively; even so, we believe this\ninformation bears repeating. Please follow these basic precautions during the current crisis\n—and at all times:\n\nInstall apps only from official stores, such as Google Play.\nNever click on unknown links received through ads, SMS messages, emails, or the\nlike.\n\n\n-----\n\nNever trust apps with claims that seem unrealistic. (There is no technology yet\ninvented that can inform a user whether a coronavirus patient is nearby.)\nAlways keep the \"Unknown Sources\" option disabled in the Android device. This\ndisallows apps to be installed on your device from unknown sources.\n\n\n-----",
