We identified over\n200 samples of malware generated by the group over the last two years. These attacks are\nthemed around Middle Eastern political issues and the motivation appears to relate to\nespionage, as opposed to opportunistic or criminal intentions.\n\nThese are not technically sophisticated attackers. However, they do deploy some novel\ntactics, detailed below, and the implications of these attacks could be significant. Both the\ntools and targets of Moonlight are reminiscent of “Gaza Hacker Team,” a group of attackers\n[that are said to be politically aligned to the Hamas[1]. In spite of these commonalities, we](http://moonlight-targeted-attacks-in-the-middle-east/)\nhave not identified any firm links between the two groups.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe refer to this group of attackers as Moonlight, after the name the attackers chose for one\nof their command-and-control domains.\n\n[[1] http://www.securityweek.com/gaza-cybergang-attacks-attributed-hamas](http://www.securityweek.com/gaza-cybergang-attacks-attributed-hamas)\n\n## Moonlight’s targets\n\nVectra Networks worked with providers to sinkhole Moonlight’s command-and-control\ninfrastructure. The hosts seen via our sinkhole show a clear targeting of Middle Eastern\nvictims:\n\n**Figure 1:** _Moonlight’s victims of attacks_\n\nMost of these victims are connecting from home networks, and are therefore unidentifiable,\nthough one notable victim is a Palestinian news organization.\n\nVectra believes the victims from the United States and China are outliers. These infected\nmachines were primarily from university networks and were likely either security researchers\nsandboxing malware or overseas students targeted for links to their homeland.\n\nIndirect targeting data from to the online virus scanning site VirusTotal, and traffic statistics\nfrom the URL linking services the attackers use indicate many of these attacks are targeted\ntowards either small groups or individual targets:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: The statistics show one of the attacker’s malicious files, registering only two clicks**\n\n## OpenMe.docx.exe\n\nThe attackers name their malware as documents of interest to their victims, to entice them to\nopen them. The malicious decoy documents display themes relevant to Middle Eastern\npolitics, and provide some indication as to who the intended targets may be:\n\n20160611-NCRI-AR-Rajavi-Syria-Ramadan.docx.exe\nAssassination of Talal of Jordan YouTube.exe\nAudio recording of the meeting of Egyptian Emirati. MP3.exe\nBrigadier Alleno behind moral projection of Zakaria al-Agha.docx.exe\nexe\nFatah foreign conspiracies.exe\nWapons and ammunition stores found while digging a waterway in Egyptian Rafah.exe\nHamas and Fatah agree to the following.exe\nHamas and the Egyptian army.exe\nHamas and the Salafist jihadist in the Gaza Strip.scr\nHamas Betrayal.exe\nImportant leaking security meeting Arab Emirates.exe\nscr\nLeaked audio recording of the meeting of Egyptian security Emirates.mp3.exe\nLeaking important Arab Emirates security meeting.mp3.exe\nMeeting of the Executive Committee of the PLO.exe\nPresident sources oust Fatah leadership in Gaza and the cost Abu Samhadana to lead\nthe organization.doc.exe\nSawiris and the project of the Suez Canal.exe\nSinai Bombings.docx.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nThe full truth behind Abu Ghussains disease.exe\nThe grandson of President Abbas in the festival of love, and what response was Mr.\nSamir Mashharawi him.exe\nThe names of the perpetrators of the bombings in the Gaza Strip.exe\nThe son of Mufti takfiri Hamas fist anti-drug police.docx.exe\n\nMoonlight demonstrates that 0-days, or even exploits, aren’t required to successfully\ncompromise machines. Instead, they show a preference for the classic social engineering\napproach of sending e-mails with attachments or links to files with the filename [legitimate\nfile-extension].exe, for example:\n\nscr\nSecrets documents Panama.docx.exe\ndoc.exe\nAudio recording of the meeting of Egyptian Emirati.mp3.exe\n\nMoonlight typically makes good on the promised theme of the lures, and present the victim\nwith a relevant “decoy document”:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3:\"Meeting of the Executive Committee of the PLO\" - Decoy documents opened on**\n_victim machines by the malware_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4:** _Decoy video about women trafficked to Syria_\n\n## Impersonated new organizations\n\nThe attackers typically deploy malicious files via shortened URLs, presumably to look more\ninnocuous. Many of the links and domains impersonate Middle Eastern media organizations\nsuch as Eln News and Wattan TV:\n\nhttp://bit[.]do/www-elnnews-com\nhttp://wattan.tep[.]su/deaf.rar\nhttp://www.aman-news[.]com/arab/betrayal%20of%20Hamas.%20exe\n\nOne domain impersonating the media, Alwatenvoice[.]com, also hosts “landing pages” to\nencourage victims to download the malware, described below.\n\n## Distribution\n\nOne Facebook user has shared a number of posts from the malicious Alwatenvoice[.]com:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5:** _Two pages containing malware shared by the user on Facebook_\n\nThe second post is of particular interest. The Facebook information box says the article is\nfrom All4Syria[.]info, a popular independent news outlet reporting on Syria, but in fact it leads\nto Alwatenvoice[.]com:\n\n**Figure 6: The link to All4Syria[.]info that actually leads to Alwatenvoice[.]com**\n\nThe user is then presented with a page that looks very much like the real All4Syria website:\n\n**Figure 7:** _The malicious page on Alwatenvoice[.]com on the left, and the legitimate site_\n_All4Syria[.]nfo on the right_\n\n\n-----\n\nIf a user clicks play, they are asked to download malware named ﺷﺒﻜﺎت اﻟﺪﻋﺎرة اﻟﺴﻮرﯾﺔ.mp4.exe\n(“Syrian Prostitution Rings.mp4.exe”).\n\nThe profile posting these malicious links has a very small number of public posts. The first\npost from 2015 shows the user setting their wallpaper to the logo of Fatah. There are two\ncelebrations of Facebook friendship displayed publicly, one of whom can be identified from\nthe name and Facebook profile information. Their details match that of a senior Fatah\nmilitant who Reuters reported was targeted for assassination during violent struggles\nbetween Hamas in Fatah in 2007.\n\nWe would stress that even if the account is controlled by the attackers it could be an account\nthat they have compromised, or impersonates an innocent and unconnected person. It is\nalso possible that the account sharing the malicious links belongs to a user who is\nunknowingly spreading malicious content.\n\n## H-Worm\n\n[Moonlight typically delivers an obfuscated version of the widely available H-Worm[2], a](https://www.vectra.ai/blog-post/moonlight-targeted-attacks-in-the-middle-east)\nmalicious Visual Basic Script worm, as their first stage backdoor. Moonlight deploy an everchanging range of deployment scripts to evade anti-virus software. Many of these use basic\nscripts within self-extracting RAR archives to install the malware:\n\n[2] https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/09/now-you-see-me-h-worm-byhoudini.html\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 8:** _Some of the malicious scripts used by Moonlight to deploy H-Worm_\n\nIn these excerpts, we see the Moonlight make some strange choices in deploying their\nmalware such as:\n\nOpening a decoy document from the Windows System folder\nPreventing users from deleting any files (including the installed malware) from the\nC:\\temp\\ folder\n\nThere is a large amount of variation in the scripts used to install malware, and it’s likely that\nthe large number of samples have been produced by hand, rather than a more\nproductionised process of using build tools that is preferred by more sophisticated groups.\n\n## njRat\n\nRecords to URLs that users have submitted to VirusTotal record the attackers installing\nadditional malware using the access they gained with the first stage H-Worm malware.\n[Examples of this are recorded in URLs submitted to VirusTotal[3] for the domain](https://www.vectra.ai/blog-post/moonlight-targeted-attacks-in-the-middle-east)\nfun2[.]dynu.com:\n\n### Date\n\n Location\n\n\n-----\n\n2016-05-24\n\nC:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/service.exe\n\n2016-05-31\n\nC:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/WindowsService1.exe\n\n2016-08-10\n\nC:/users/administrator/desktop/k.exe\n\n2016-08-10\n\nC:/users/administrator/desktop/service.exe\n\n[[3] https://www.virustotal.com/en/domain/fun2.dynu.com/information/](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/domain/fun2.dynu.com/detection)\n\nAs with earlier stages, the attackers employ a number of methods to deploy the well[known[4] njRat which seems to vary from sample to sample. In one example the malware](https://www.vectra.ai/blog-post/moonlight-targeted-attacks-in-the-middle-east)\nstores a program within a base64 compressed blob. This is then loaded into memory, and\nexecuted using EntryPoint.Invoke():\n\n**Figure 9:** _An example loader for njRat deployed by Moonlight_\n\n[4] http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/simple-njrat-fuels-nascent-middle-eastcybercrime-scene and http://threatgeek.typepad.com/files/fta-1009---njrat-uncovered.pdf\n\nThe 24 Kb of code this decodes to is another .NET application – njRat. Other droppers also\ndecrypt the blob, before it is executed. Both njRat and code obfuscators such as this are\nfreely available, and there are a plethora of tutorials available online to help budding hackers\nuse them with limited technical knowledge.\n\n## A significant operation\n\nMoonlight’s command-and-control infrastructure is very simple. It consists of dynamic\ndomains controlled via home internet connections in the West Bank of Palestine. We were\nsurprised to identify a very large number of varied malware samples (over 200) attached to\nthis simple infrastructure:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 10:** _Moonlight’s infrastructure_\n\n## Attacker evolution\n\nThe earliest attacks appear to be non-targeted, opportunistically inviting victims to click links\non Youtube videos and social media posts typical of Middle-Eastern “hacktivists.” Later\nattacks appear to target particular groups or individuals. Moonlight’s usage of the Google\nURL shortening service allows us to roughly compare attacks over time:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 11:** _One attack from December 2014 (left), and one from December 2015 (right)_\n\n## Who are the attackers?\n\n[In general, the assigned IP-location of command and control servers is a poor indication[5] of](https://www.vectra.ai/blog-post/moonlight-targeted-attacks-in-the-middle-east)\nattacker locations. However, in this case the provided locations of home networks in the\nGaza strip are likely to be accurate and fits with other details from the attacks. The attackers\nalso demonstrate low operational security, particularly in their earlier attacks. Domain Whois\nrecords and social media posts provide strong ideas as to the identities of some of those\ninvolved. It would not be prudent to publish the identities of the possible attackers in a\nconflict zone.\n\nPerhaps a more interesting question is \"What are the attackers’ aims?\" Or if they are being\ndirected, who is ultimately funding and tasking them?\n\n[5] With reference to http://www.csoonline.com/article/3028788/techology-business/norsecorp-deconstructing-threat-intelligence-on-iran.html and [https://threatbutt.com/map/](https://threatbutt.com/map/)\n\n## Countering attacks\n\nAttacks such as these are often overlooked due to their low technical sophistication. But the\nstakes of these attacks are high, even if the attacker skill level is low. If the motivation behind\nthese attacks is indeed political, the consequences could mean loss of life. Violence between\nrival political factions in Palestine has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people.\n\nIndividuals and organizations outside of the Middle East are unlikely to encounter the attacks\nby Moonlight. However, the tools and techniques deployed are typical of low-skilled but\ndetermined attackers within the Middle East and serve as an example of the kinds of attacks\nthat often slip through. Moonlight’s strategy of obfuscating well known malware appears to\nbe fairly successful at evading host-based security mechanisms. The network\ncommunications of the well-known malware families such as H-Worm and njRat should still\ntrigger existing network signature base detection tools.\n\nVectra customers are protected through the following generic detections:\n\n\n-----\n\nSuspicious HTTP – Provides generic detection of HTTP based malware such as HWorm\nExternal Remote Access –Provides generic detection of RATs such as njRat\nMalware Update – Provides generic detection of secondary malware over HTTP(S)\n\nSecurity professionals can review the Appendix for a full listing of file-hashes and domains\nemployed in these attackers.\n\nVectra Threat Labs operates at the precise intersection of security research and data\nscience. We take unexplained phenomena seen in customer networks and dig deeper to find\nthe underlying reasons for the observed behavior.\n\n{{cta('c55c408c-ddec-4ebb-a41f-666d25face78')}}\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Domains\n\nAny traffic to the following domains on your network should be investigated.
