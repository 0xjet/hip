The company believes this is a new group, different from other\nadvanced criminal organizations that have hit the financial sector in the past, like the\nCarbanak, Cobalt, and Lazarus Group operations.\n\nResearchers named this new group MoneyTaker, based on the name attackers gave to one\nof their hacking utilities.\n\n## MoneyTaker group began operations in 2016\n\nAccording to Group-IB, MoneyTaker has started operations sometimes in 2016, hitting its\nfirst target —a Florida bank— in May 2016.\n\nSince then, the group has hit 14 US banks, a US services provider, a UK company, 3\nRussian banks, and one Russian law firm.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attacks that hit banks have focused on infiltrating inter-banking money transfer and\ncard processing systems such as the First Data STAR Network and the Russian Central\nBank's AWS CBR system.\n\nAttackers infiltrated one computer, then spread laterally, gathering any files and credentials\nthey could, hoping to compromise a PC with access to the STAR or CBR networks.\n\n## Attackers studied bank networks by stealing documentation files\n\nEvidence collected by Group-IB suggests attackers intentionally searched and stole internal\ndocumentation files to learn about bank operations in preparation for future attacks.\n\nIn some cases, attackers also stole documents on SWIFT, another inter-banking money\ntransfer system, and files on OceanSystems’ FedLink, a card processing system widely\ndeployed across Latin America.\n\n\n-----\n\nNow, experts believe Latin America banks and banks utilizing the SWIFT system are in\nMoneyTaker's crosshairs. The SWIFT team issued a [report last month with](https://www.swift.com/news-events/news/the-evolving-cyber-threat-to-the-global-banking-community)\nrecommendations on how banks could improve their security.\n\n## Attackers used fileless malware, legitimate apps\n\nAs for the \"hacking\" part of the MoneyTaker attacks, Group-IB said the hackers' activity was\nvery hard to investigate.\n\nAttackers used common and legitimate apps to carry out malicious operations and used a\nwide arsenal of malware families. Each hack was different, showing that the group studied\neach target in fine detail and deployed only tools appropriate for those targets.\n\nThe hackers never focused on one bank system alone, and stole money from card\nprocessing systems, from ATM networks, and even installed POS (Point-of-Sale) trojans\nwhen the hacked organizations weren't financial institutions and had no connection to a\nlarge inter-banking network.\n\nAccording to Group-IB, the group used the MoneyTaker malware framework to hijack interbanking and card processing operations, the ScanPOS malware for POS systems, custom\nscreenshoting and keylogging tools and the Citadel and Kronos banking trojans to move\nlaterally inside networks. The table below shows tools used by MoneyTaker during their\nattacks.\n\nIn addition, MoneyTaker also used SSL certificates generated in the name of big brands to\nsign their malware, used one-time Yandex and Mail.ru email accounts, and employed the\noverdraft technique for cashing stolen funds with the help of money mules.\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther, the hackers also took the time to delete their entry points, as Group-IB was not able\nto find the initial infection vector, and used a unique command-and-control server\ninfrastructure that did not deploy any malware unless the download request came from a\ntargeted bank's IP address range.\n\nGroup-IB investigators said they forwarded all the data they gather on this group to Europol\nand Interpol, as they suspect this will not be the last time we hear about MoneyTaker's\noperations.\n\n_Bleeping Computer readers can get their hands on the Group-IB MoneyTaker report from_\n_[here.](https://www.group-ib.com/resources/reports/money-taker.html)_\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[U.S. DOJ will no longer prosecute ethical hackers under CFAA](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-doj-will-no-longer-prosecute-ethical-hackers-under-cfaa/)\n\n[National bank hit by ransomware trolls hackers with dick pics](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/national-bank-hit-by-ransomware-trolls-hackers-with-dick-pics/)\n\n[Chinese ‘Space Pirates’ are hacking Russian aerospace firms](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-space-pirates-are-hacking-russian-aerospace-firms/)\n\n[APT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/apt/)\n[Bank](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/bank/)\n[Cybercrime](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cybercrime/)\n[Hack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hack/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a\nfew more.
