The actors behind this campaign we call\nLUCKY ELEPHANT use doppelganger webpages to mimic legitimate entities such as\nforeign governments, telecommunications, and military. Interestingly, at least one IP\naddress used in the campaign was previously associated with a suspected Indian APT\ngroup, and one domain was previously attributed to Chinese APT activity. It is unclear the\npurpose of the overlap in the infrastructure, but it’s possible the actors used it as a\ndiversionary tactic.\n\n**NOTE:** [NETSCOUT AED/APS enterprise security products detect, and block activity](https://www.netscout.com/products/netscout-aed)\nrelated to the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign using our ATLAS Intelligence Feed (AIF).\n\n## Key Findings\n\nASERT uncovered a credential theft campaign we call LUCKY ELEPHANT where\nattackers masquerade as legitimate entities such as foreign government,\ntelecommunications, and military.\nThe doppelganger webpages primary purpose is to gather login credentials; we\nhave not observed malware payloads associated with the campaign.\nOne IP address used in the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign was previously used by\nthe suspected Indian APT [DoNot Team; and at least one of the domains used for](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/donot-team-leverages-new-modular-malware-framework-south-asia)\ncredential harvesting was previously attributed to a Chinese APT group.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nFrom at least February 2019 to present, the actors in the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign\ncopied webpages to mimic South Asian government websites as well as Microsoft Outlook\n365 login pages and hosted them on their own doppelganger domains, presumably to trick\nvictims into providing login credentials. They registered their doppelgangers with various\ntop-level domains (TLD), specifically those that afford the actors registrant anonymity.\nASERT suspects that the Actors use phishing emails to lure victims to the doppelganger\nwebsites and entice users to enter their credentials. We have yet to uncover any malware\nassociated with this campaign.\n\nThe Actors download legitimate websites and webmail portals, which copies the entirety of\nits contents and web components. This method saves time and prevents the introduction\nof errors that could arouse suspicion. Figure 1 & Figure 2 show two of the doppelganger\nwebpages, clearly intending to pass as a legitimate place to input credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Bangladesh Navy Fake Login Page\n\n\nFigure 2: Nepalese Army Fake Login Page\n\n\n## Victims\n\nMany of the targeted entities are easily identified based on the copied webpages or the\ndoppelganger names of the fake domains. To date, ASERT has no knowledge of\nsuccessful compromise. The following is a list of the organizations mimicked:\n\nPakistan:\n\nPakistan Atomic Energy Commission\nPakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nPakistan National Telecom Corporation\nPakistani Air Force\nPakistan Ministry of Law & Justice\nPakistan Prime Minister’s Office\nFrontier Works Organization\nPakistan Ordnance Factories\nPakistani Nuclear Regulatory Authority\nBangladesh:\n\nBangladesh Air Force\nBangladesh Navy\n\n\n-----\n\nSri Lankan Air Force\nMaldives National Defense Force\nMyanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nNepal:\n\nNepalese Army\nNepalese Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nShanghai Cooperation Organization (a Eurasian political, economic, and security\nalliance)\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nWe discovered two active IP addresses: 128.127.105[.]13 and 179.43.169[.]20. Through\nthe course of monitoring these IP addresses, we uncovered new doppelganger domains\nset up to facilitate the credential harvesting campaign. This activity started in February\n2019 and appears to be ongoing. Though we don't have WHOIS data for the domains, we\nwere able to track registration due to the small number of IP address utilized.\n\nIt is important to note that one domain, yahoomail[.]cf is only associated with this\ngroup/campaign from February 2019 onward. In late 2018, the domain was associated\nwith a different APT group/campaign of Chinese origin. The subdomains\nsecurity[.]yahoomail[.]cf and cc[.]yahoomail[.]cf are related to the ExileRAT campaign\n[Cisco Talos reported (link). It is unclear if the domain ownership change was coincidental](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/02/exilerat-shares-c2-with-luckycat.html)\nor intended to confuse researchers.\n\n**IOC List:**\n\n103.243.173.253 mail-nepalarmymil-np.gq paec-gov-pk.ga\n\n128.127.105.13 mail-ntc-net-pk.tk paec-gov-pk-taskmail.tk\n\n179.43.169.20 mail-outlook-support-team.tk paecweb-gov.gq\n\n77.244.211.55 mail-paf-gov.cf paecwebmail.gq\n\naccount-sign-in-security.ga mail-sign-alert-notification.cf paf-gov-pk.cf\n\naccount-update-com.tk mail-updates-systems.ga paf-gov-pk.ga\n\naccount-updates-team.ga mail-update-task.ga paf-gov-pk.tk\n\nafd-gov-bd.gq mail-update-team.ga paknavy-pk.gq\n\nbaf-mil-bd.tk mail-yahoo-com.tk pmo-gov-pk.tk\n\ncheckbox.gq mail-yahoo-task.tk pnra-org.gq\n\ncyber-net-pk.cf micorsoft-outlook-update.ml pof-gov-pk.tk\n\nfwo-com.tk mofa-gov-mm.ml rab-gov-bd.gq\n\ng00gle-com.cf mofagov-np.cf sco-gov-pk.tk\n\ngooglemail-com.gq mofa-gov-np.cf sharepoint-google.ml\n\nlive-com.gq mofa-gov-pk.tk slaf-gov-lk.ml\n\nlive-com.ml molaw-gov-pk.cf super-net-pk.cf\n\n|103.243.173.253|mail-nepalarmymil-np.gq|paec-gov-pk.ga|\n|---|---|---|\n|128.127.105.13|mail-ntc-net-pk.tk|paec-gov-pk-taskmail.tk|\n|179.43.169.20|mail-outlook-support-team.tk|paecweb-gov.gq|\n|77.244.211.55|mail-paf-gov.cf|paecwebmail.gq|\n|account-sign-in-security.ga|mail-sign-alert-notification.cf|paf-gov-pk.cf|\n|account-update-com.tk|mail-updates-systems.ga|paf-gov-pk.ga|\n|account-updates-team.ga|mail-update-task.ga|paf-gov-pk.tk|\n|afd-gov-bd.gq|mail-update-team.ga|paknavy-pk.gq|\n|baf-mil-bd.tk|mail-yahoo-com.tk|pmo-gov-pk.tk|\n|checkbox.gq|mail-yahoo-task.tk|pnra-org.gq|\n|cyber-net-pk.cf|micorsoft-outlook-update.ml|pof-gov-pk.tk|\n|fwo-com.tk|mofa-gov-mm.ml|rab-gov-bd.gq|\n|g00gle-com.cf|mofagov-np.cf|sco-gov-pk.tk|\n|googlemail-com.gq|mofa-gov-np.cf|sharepoint-google.ml|\n|live-com.gq|mofa-gov-pk.tk|slaf-gov-lk.ml|\n\n\n-----\n\n|live-service.cf|outlook-com.cf|super-net-pk.tk|\n|---|---|---|\n|login-live-com.cf|outlook-livecom.cf|test-updates.ga|\n|login-yah00-com.tk|outlook-live-com.cf|userscontent.com|\n|login-yahoo-com.ga|outlook-live-com.ga|yahoo-com.ga|\n|live-com-owa .gq|outlooklive-com.ml|yahoomail.cf|\n|mail-account-security-com.cf|outlook-live-com.tk|yahoomail-com.cf|\n|mail-accounts-verify-com.cf|outlookmail-com.tk|yahoo-mail-com.ml|\n|mail-intl-ja-mail-about.gq|paecgov-pk.cf||\n\n\n## Adversary\n\nBased on our analysis into the activity, ASERT deems with moderate confidence that an\nIndian APT group is behind the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign. The targets are typical of\nknown Indian APT activity and the infrastructure was previously used by an Indian APT\ngroup. Phishing and credential theft are commonly observed with Indian targeting inregion.\n\nOne of the IP addresses, 128.127.105[.]13, was previously used by the [DoNot Team (aka](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/donot-team-leverages-new-modular-malware-framework-south-asia)\nAPT-C-35), a suspected Indian APT group. DoNot Team has a history of heavily targeting\nPakistan, in addition to other neighboring countries. The 360 Intelligence Center observed\n[four distinct campaigns against Pakistan since 2017 (link), recently targeting Pakistani](https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/donot-group-is-targeting-pakistani-businessman-working-in-china-en/)\nbusinessmen working in China. They also note that DoNot has targeted other South\nAsian countries for cyber espionage purposes. DoNot Team’s confirmed use of this IP\ndates back to September 2018, with a six-month gap until it was used to host\ndoppelganger domains for the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign in early February.\n\nThe targeting of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and the\nShanghai Cooperation Organization are all historical espionage targets by India. The\nIndian government is particularly concerned with its neighboring countries, specifically\nregarding contested land; the targeting aligns with these concerns. The heavier targeting\nin Pakistan adheres to historical targeting and the ongoing tension between the two\ncountries, which has escalated since a terrorist attack in Kashmir on 14 February 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: South Asia Map (generated by Google Maps)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSocial engineering continues to be a key tool for adversaries to trick users into yielding\nvaluable information. The actors behind LUCKY ELEPHANT recognize the effectiveness\nand use doppelganger webpages nearly identical to legitimate sites, enticing users to input\ntheir credentials. It is unclear exactly how effective and widespread this campaign is at\ngathering credentials, as well as how any compromised credentials are being used.\nHowever, it is clear is that the actors are actively establishing infrastructure and are\ntargeting governments in South Asia.\n\nASERT Researchers are interested in collaborating with others to further the collective\nknowledge of this campaign and we will tweet any additional IOCs under the Twitter\nhandle [@ASERTResearch.](https://twitter.com/ASERTResearch)\n\n## Recommendations\n\nOrganizations with a presence in South Asia should be on the lookout for these\nIOCs and examine any “password” or “account” themed emails\n\n\n-----\n\nkind\nUsers should be cognizant of websites with TLDs such as .tk, .ml, .ga, .gq, and .cf,\nas they are highly unlikely to be a legitimate government or corporate domain\nMulti-factor authentication would likely prevent access from the compromised\ncredentials\nIf compromise of credentials is suspected, administrators should:\n\nPerform an immediate password reset\nLook for abnormal login activity that is outside the typical pattern of life for the\nlegitimate user\nHost infosec training for users and remind them they are a target--at work and\nhome\n\n\n-----",
