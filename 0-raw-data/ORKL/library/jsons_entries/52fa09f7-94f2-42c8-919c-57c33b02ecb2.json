    "plain_text": "# Russia's GRU Hackers Hit US Government and Energy Targets\n\n**[wired.com/story/russia-fancy-bear-us-hacking-campaign-government-energy/](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-fancy-bear-us-hacking-campaign-government-energy/)**\n\nAndy Greenberg July 24, 2020\n\nRussia's GRU military intelligence agency has carried out many of the most aggressive acts\n[of hacking in history: destructive worms,](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/) [blackouts, and—closest to home for Americans—a](https://www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-attack-ukraine/)\nbroad [hacking-and-leaking operation designed to influence the outcome of the 2016 US](https://www.wired.com/story/dnc-lawsuit-reveals-key-details-2016-hack/)\npresidential election. Now it appears the GRU has been hitting US networks again, in a\nseries of previously unreported intrusions that targeted organizations ranging from\ngovernment agencies to critical infrastructure.\n\nFrom December 2018 until at least May of this year, the GRU hacker group known as APT28\nor Fancy Bear carried out a broad hacking campaign against US targets, according to an FBI\nnotification sent to victims of the breaches in May and obtained by WIRED. According to the\nFBI, the GRU hackers primarily attempted to break into victims’ mail servers, Microsoft Office\n365 and email accounts, and VPN servers. The targets included \"a wide range of US-based\norganizations, state and federal government agencies, and educational institutions,\" the FBI\nnotification states. And technical breadcrumbs included in that notice reveal that APT28\nhackers have targeted the US energy sector, too, apparently as part of the same effort.\n\n\"The natural worry is, am I the next John Podesta?\"\n\nAPT28 Victim\n\n\n-----\n\nThe revelation of a potentially ongoing US-targeted GRU hacking spree is especially\ntroubling in light of the GRU's past operations, which have often gone beyond mere\n[espionage to include embarrassing email leaks or even](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-election-hacking-playbook/) [disruptive cyberattacks. APT28](https://www.wired.com/story/sandworm-kremlin-most-dangerous-hackers/)\nhackers in particular have been the subject of US indictments alleging hack-and-leak\noperations targeting both the 2016 US election and the [Worldwide Anti-doping Agency. The](https://www.wired.com/story/russian-spies-indictment-hotel-wi-fi-hacking/)\nlatter attack was in apparent retaliation for the International Olympic Committee banning\nRussia from the 2018 Olympics for performance-enhancing drug use.\n\n\"Although not all motives are clear, we can make judgments based on the nature of the\ntarget as seen through past indictments,\" an FBI spokesperson wrote in a statement\nresponding to WIRED's request for further comment on the notification sent to APT28\nhacking victims. The FBI also says that the GRU hacking campaign has likely continued into\nrecent months. \"An Advanced Persistent Threat is just that,\" the spokesperson added,\nreferring to the APT acronym from which APT28 takes its name. \"There is an expectation of\ncontinued activity.\"\n\nAccording to the FBI's victim notification, the APT28 hackers have gained access to\nnetworks via spear-phishing emails sent to both personal and work email accounts. They've\nalso used password-spraying attacks, in which hackers try common passwords across many\naccounts, as well as brute force attacks that guess a long list of passwords against one or a\nsmall number of accounts.\n\nWithin days of the FBI's notification being sent to victims in early May, the NSA issued a\n[public advisory that Sandworm, a separate but closely linked GRU hacker group, was](https://www.wired.com/story/sandworm-kremlin-most-dangerous-hackers/)\n[exploiting a vulnerability in Exim mail servers to target victims. The FBI told WIRED it knew](https://www.wired.com/story/nsa-sandworm-exim-mail-server-warning/)\nof no connection between that Exim exploitation and the APT28 campaign.\n\nOne staff member at an affected organization told WIRED that the IT staff had seen no sign\nof a successful phishing attack—but nonetheless found that the hackers had accessed their\nemail server. \"Once they were on the server they stole entire mailboxes,\" says the staffer,\nwho asked that WIRED not reveal either their identity or the organization they work for.\n\nThe organization was eventually notified by the FBI that they had in fact been breached by\nAPT28. \"The natural worry is, am I the next John Podesta?\" the staffer says, referring to the\n[Hillary Clinton campaign director whose emails were stolen and leaked by APT28 ahead of](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/basic-security-tips-clinton-campaign-anyone-else/)\nthe 2016 election. \"Reading the victim notification and realizing how many different\norganizations were probably targeted, it just underscores that exactly what we worried about\nin 2016 is something that Russia is literally still doing as we speak.\"\n\nThe FBI declined to comment on how many victims the APT28 campaign may have targeted,\nor how many of those attempts were successful. But security firm FireEye says it has learned\nof a \"handful\" of victim organizations that were compromised by hackers using the same IP\naddresses listed as used by APT28 in the FBI victim notification. In those cases, the hackers\n\n\n-----\n\nappear not to have infected systems with malware, says Ben Read, a cyberespionage\nanalyst at FireEye, instead using stolen credentials to move around the corporate network as\nemployees would. \"It was a pretty light touch,\" Read says.\n\nWhile neither FireEye nor the FBI would reveal the identities of APT28's victims, at least one\nof the group's targets appears to have been in the US energy industry. A Department of\nEnergy advisory issued in January warned that on Christmas Eve of last year, someone\nprobed the login pages of a \"US energy entity\" from an IP address that had previously been\nused by APT28. That same IP address was also listed by the FBI among those used by\nAPT28's hackers through May, confirming that APT28 was very likely behind that incident.\n\nEnergy sector intrusions would represent a shift in targeting for APT28, says Joe Slowik, the\nsecurity researcher at industrial-control-system security firm Dragos who spotted the\nconnection between the DOE advisory and the FBI victim notification. \"Just given what we\nunderstand about how APT28 operates and its typical victimology, identifying that group\ninteracting with the US energy sector would be substantially different from how this group\nhas behaved previously,\" he says.\n\nWhile apparently a new venture for APT28, the GRU as a whole does have a history of\nhacking critical infrastructure. The GRU hacker group Sandworm planted malware on the\nnetworks of US electric utilities in 2014, then carried out the first-ever cyberattack-induced\nblackouts in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016. The notion that APT28 may now be sniffing around\nUS energy industry targets too—or that Sandworm is, given that the two groups have\nteamed up in the past—is disturbing, argues Slowik. \"This is a concerning data point,\" Slowik\nsays. \"It’s the first time in a while that this group has targeted US critical infrastructure.\"\n\nA new GRU hacking campaign targeting US organizations in 2020 also raises the specter of\nanother round of election meddling, given the GRU's notorious campaign of electoral\ninterference in 2016. US intelligence officials have been warning since early this year that\nRussia has sought to interfere in US electoral politics again to help reelect President Trump.\nBut the FBI and FireEye both say they saw no signs that this particular string of intrusions by\nAPT28 were related to the upcoming presidential election.\n\nInstead, says FireEye's Read, the campaign shows that the GRU's general interest in US\ntargets hasn't ended, even as its endgame remain unclear. \"The US continues to be the chief\nantagonist for Russia in their mind. It's an important reminder that this is still going on,\" says\nRead. \"It's hard to say if it’s a significant escalation. But it’s obviously not good.\"\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n[Behind bars, but still posting on TikTok](https://www.wired.com/story/prison-tiktok-behind-bars-still-posting/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_4&itm_content=footer-recirc)\nMy friend was struck by ALS.
