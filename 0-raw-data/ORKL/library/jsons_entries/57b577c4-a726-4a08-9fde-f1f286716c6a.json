The exact same certificate had been used to sign non-malicious D-Link\nsoftware; therefore, the certificate was likely stolen.\n\nHaving confirmed the file’s malicious nature, we notified D-Link, who launched their own\ninvestigation into the matter. As a result, the compromised digital certificate was revoked by\nD-Link on July 3, 2018.\n\nFigure 1. The D-Link Corporation code signing certificate used to sign malware\n\n## The malware\n\nOur analysis identified two different malware families that were misusing the stolen\ncertificate – the Plead malware, a remotely controlled backdoor, and a related password\n[stealer component. Recently, the JPCERT published a thorough analysis of the Plead](https://blog.jpcert.or.jp/2018/06/plead-downloader-used-by-blacktech.html)\nbackdoor, which, according to Trend Micro, is used by the cyberespionage group\n[BlackTech.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/following-trail-blacktech-cyber-espionage-campaigns/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. The Changing Information Technology Inc. code signing certificate used to sign malware\n\nAlong with the Plead samples signed with the D-Link certificate, ESET researchers have\nalso identified samples signed using a certificate belonging to a Taiwanese security\ncompany named Changing Information Technology Inc.\n\nDespite the fact that the Changing Information Technology Inc. certificate was revoked on\nJuly 4, 2017, the BlackTech group is still using it to sign their malicious tools.\n\nThe ability to compromise several Taiwan-based technology companies and reuse their\ncode-signing certificates in future attacks shows that this group is highly skilled and focused\non that region.\n\nThe signed Plead malware samples are highly obfuscated with junk code, but the purpose\nof the malware is similar in all samples: it downloads from a remote server or opens from\nthe local disk a small encrypted binary blob. This binary blob contains encrypted shellcode,\nwhich downloads the final Plead backdoor module.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Obfuscated code of the Plead malware\n\nThe password stealer tool is used to collect saved passwords from the following\napplications:\n\nGoogle Chrome\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer\nMicrosoft Outlook\nMozilla Firefox\n\n## Why steal digital certificates?\n\nMisusing digital certificates is one of the many ways cybercriminals try to mask their\nmalicious intentions – as the stolen certificates let malware appear like legitimate\napplications, the malware has a greater chance of sneaking past security measures without\nraising suspicion.\n\nProbably the most infamous malware known to have used several stolen digital certificates\nis the [Stuxnet worm, discovered in 2010 and the malware behind the very first cyberattack](https://www.welivesecurity.com/?s=stuxnet)\nto target critical infrastructure. Stuxnet used digital certificates stolen from RealTek and one\nfrom JMicron, two well-known technology companies based in Taiwan.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, the tactic is not exclusive to high-profile incidents like Stuxnet, as evidenced by\nthis recent discovery.\n\n## IoCs\n\n**ESET detection names**\n\nWin32/PSW.Agent.OES trojan\n\nWin32/Plead.L trojan\n\nWin32/Plead.S trojan\n\nWin32/Plead.T trojan\n\nWin32/Plead.U trojan\n\nWin32/Plead.V trojan\n\nWin32/Plead.X trojan\n\nWin32/Plead.Y trojan\n\nWin32/Plead.Z trojan\n\n**Unsigned samples (SHA-1)**\n\n80AE7B26AC04C93AD693A2D816E8742B906CC0E3\n\n62A693F5E4F92CCB5A2821239EFBE5BD792A46CD\n\nB01D8501F1EEAF423AA1C14FCC816FAB81AC8ED8\n\n11A5D1A965A3E1391E840B11705FFC02759618F8\n\n239786038B9619F9C22401B110CF0AF433E0CEAD\n\n**Signed samples (SHA-1)**\n\n1DB4650A89BC7C810953160C6E41A36547E8CF0B\n\nCA160884AE90CFE6BEC5722FAC5B908BF77D9EEF\n\n9C4F8358462FAFD83DF51459DBE4CD8E5E7F2039\n\n13D064741B801E421E3B53BC5DABFA7031C98DD9\n\n**C&C servers**\n\n\n-----\n\n**C&C servers**\n\namazon.panasocin[.]com\n\noffice.panasocin[.]com\n\nokinawas.ssl443[.]org\n\n**Code signing certificates serial**\n**numbers**\n\nD-Link Corporation: 13:03:03:e4:57:0c:27:29:09:e2:65:dd:b8:59:de:ef\n\nChanging Information Technology Inc: 73:65:ed:e7:f8:fb:b1:47:67:02:d2:93:08:39:6f:51\n\n1e:50:cc:3d:d3:9b:4a:cc:5e:83:98:cc:d0:dd:53:ea\n\n9 Jul 2018 - 12:28PM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
