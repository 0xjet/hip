Whether it’s [malware, email fraud,](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/malware)\ncloud [account takeover or credential phishing, cyber attacks no longer focus on breaking](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/account-takeover-fraud)\nthrough network controls and cracking technical flaws. Instead, they target users and exploit\nhuman nature.\n\n\n-----\n\nThat s why people are at the center of our cybersecurity mission—and why user-activated\nattacks are the focus of this report. Like most threat reports, this one highlights the latest\nquarter’s attack trends, campaigns and themes. But it goes a step further, exploring how\nattackers target people and what you can do about it.\n\nOur goal in this report is twofold. First, we want to help demystify cybersecurity by shedding\nlight on the people-centric nature of today’s threats. Second, and just as critical, we want to\nshow how organizations can use this insight better protect their greatest asset and today’s\nbiggest risk: their people.\n\nThe report is a small slice of the insight we offer customers through the Proofpoint Nexus\nThreat Graph. Every day, we analyze billions of email messages, billions of URLs and\nattachments, tens of millions of cloud accounts and more—trillions of data points across all\nthe digital channels that matter. Our global footprint and laser focus on people-related cyber\nrisk give us a unique view into today’s biggest cyber threats.\n\nExcept where noted, this report covers threats and threats observed directly by our global\nnetwork of threat researchers.\n\n## Top attack techniques\n\nEmail is by far the biggest channel for cyber attacks. We saw a wide range of email attack\ntechniques in the fourth quarter, but almost all of them included some form of social\nengineering.\n\nThe term “social engineering” can include any number of psychological techniques that trick\npeople into doing something the attacker wants them to do. That may mean opening\na [malicious attachment, clicking on an unsafe URL, sending login credentials or sensitive](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/malicious-email-attachments)\ninformation or even wiring money to the attacker.\n\nFigure 1 shows attacks that used social engineering in tandem with a technical exploit or\ntechnique. In many cases, social engineering is used to trick users into doing something\ndirectly—no malware needed. If listed as a separate technique, social engineering would\neasily dominate the chart as a component in 99% of all attacks.\n\nWhen used with a technical exploit, social engineering might be something as simple as\ncreating a hard-to-resist subject line, spoofed email address. In other cases, it might be as\ninvolved as impersonating a trusted colleague to lure new victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1_\n\nHere’s a summary of how these techniques work:\n\n**Office macros: Exploits flaws in a mini-programming language designed to help**\nautomate and extend Microsoft Office features. Attackers use it to create embed\nmalicious macros that infect users’ device when opened. Most attacks involve tricking\nthe user into not just opening the document but enabling macros. Many recent attacks\nfeature a new twist on a decades-old feature of Excel. These are often classified as\nExcel 4.0 (XL4) attacks.\n**Sandbox evasion: Modern threat-detection tools safely “detonate” unknown files**\nwithin virtual machine settings to see what they do when clicked or opened. Sandbox\nevasion techniques can prevent the malware from running or limit telltale behaviors in\nvirtual environments to avoid being discovered. One of the big evasion techniques we\nsaw in Q4 was using Windows’ Regsvr32 command line tool in a way that is not\ndetected within most sandboxes. (Regsrv32 was designed to help PC administrators,\nbut it can be exploited to let attackers bypass Windows’ AppLocker security tool.)\n\n\n-----\n\n**PowerShell: Exploits Windows built-in administration tool to infect victim s PCs. These**\nattacks usually start with a phishing email that includes a URL that links to a page with\nembedded code that uses the PowerShell feature to take over the victim’s machine.\nThese attacks are hard to detect because they use a legitimate Windows feature and\ndon’t start with a full malware file. The feature can also be used to download and run\nother malicious files from the internet.\n**HTML: Web pages can include all kinds of code that exploits flaws in popular browsers**\nand, on rare occasions, operating systems. These include legitimate but compromised\nwebsites and web-based ads. Most attacks that use this technique trick the victim into\nclicking an unsafe URL, but attackers can also send HTML pages directly through\nemail.\n**Thread hijacking: After taking over someone’s email account, the attacker contacts**\npeople the compromised user knows, replying to past and ongoing email threads with a\nmalicious email.\n**Password protected: Adding password protection to a malicious file can lock it away**\nfrom many malware-detection tools. The attacker gives human readers the password\nand tricks them into opening and unlocking the file.\n**Geofencing: Limits malware behaviors to defined geographies using the infected**\ndevice’s GPS and other location features. This technique is used to target attacks or\nevade detection tools.\n\n## Top Threat Actors:\n\nAmong malicious emails we could tie to a known threat actor, more than 60% of the total\nvolume we saw in Q4 came from just two attackers, which we have designated as TA544\nand TA542 (also known as Emotet). Both attackers were also among the most prolific threat\nactors in Q3.\n\n**Note: This charts highlights email attacks that we could confidently tie to a known threat**\nactor. Determining who is behind an attack, a process known as attribution, is not always\npossible. The cyber criminal ecosystem is vast and highly fragmented. Unattributed attacks\n\n\n-----\n\nare not included in this chart to analyze and compare the biggest threats.\n\n_Figure 2_\n\n## What are ‘threat actors?’\n\nThreat actors is a term threat researchers use to describe an attacker or groups of attackers.\nThey can include:\n\n**State-sponsored attackers. Also known as advanced persistent threats (APTs), these**\nattackers typically engage in espionage on behalf of a government. But attacks may\nalso involve intellectual property theft, outright financial theft and attacks designed to\ndisrupt or damage data and systems. Whatever approach they take, they’re all meant\nto achieve a military or diplomatic goal.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cyber criminal rings. These organized crime groups are usually in it for the money. In**\nmany cases, they work like multilevel marketing franchises. An advanced threat actor\ncreates the malware “product” and sets up the infrastructure as an easy-to-use\npackage or service. Lower-level cyber criminals may rent the service for their attacks,\npaying to use it for a set period of time or getting a cut for each successful\ncompromise. In other cases, they act as distributors, sending out emails with the\nmalware and earning a commission on each successful infection. Some researchers\nconsider the most advanced cyber criminal groups to be APTs.\n**Hacktivists. This portmanteau of “hacking” and “activism” refers to attacks meant to**\nmake a political statement or effect policy change. These attacks, though rare, typically\nexpose secret information, disrupt perceived wrongdoing or embarrass foes. While\ntheir goals are different, they use many of the same tools and techniques as other\ntypes of attackers and can cause just as much harm.\n\nKnowing who is behind an attack—and what their motivations are—can be a critical part of\ndefending against them.\n\n## TA542 and the demise of Emotet\n\nTA542 has become one of the most prolific in recent years due to massive campaigns that\nuse a malware strain called Emotet. The group has targeted multiple industries around the\nworld, sending hundreds of thousands—or even millions—of messages per day.\n\nDubbed “the world’s most dangerous malware,\" E1 motet is versatile and highly adaptable. It\nwas first discovered in 2014 as a simple banking Trojan aimed at stealing account\ncredentials. Since then, it has evolved into a highly versatile malware strain used for\neverything from stealing data to harvesting email to ransomware. Emotet has been used to\ntarget critical industries around the world, including banking, e‑commerce, healthcare,\nacademia, government and technology.2\n\n\nEmotet doesn’t just compromise the systems they infected. It also uses these compromised\nmachines to launch new attacks, absorbing them to a zombie-like network of more than a\nmillion similarly infected machines known as a botnet. Other cyber criminals can pay TA542\nto use the botnet for all kinds of attacks—or could until just a few weeks ago.\n\n### The takedown\n\nAuthorities said in late January that they had shut down Emotet’s infrastructure as part of a\ncoordinated effort across nine countries in North America and Europe.3 Law enforcement\nappears to have taken over all three of Emotet’s known botnet networks. Authorities plan to\nretool the botnets to remove its own malware from infected systems.4\n\n\n### What’s next?\n\n\n-----\n\nAt this stage, there s no telling what Emotet takedown means over the long term. TA542 had\nremained active in the days leading up to the shutdown, and efforts to disrupt large botnets\nin the past have had mixed results. We don’t know how large the team was operating the\nEmotet botnet and whether all of its members were in the Ukraine, where at least two of\nEmotet’s operators were arrested.5\n\nIf segments of the botnet and associated operators survive, Emotet’s source code may be\nretooled under a new infrastructure and new moniker. Threat actors often build redundancy\ninto their infrastructure, and their teams often live in countries beyond the reach of the law.\n\n## TA544 goes on a financial cyber crime spree\n\nFirst documented in 2017, TA544 is part of a financial crime ring that has targeted a range of\nindustries Japan and several European countries, with a heavy focus on manufacturing and\ntech firms. It is an affiliate that distributes several strains of malware, including Panda Banker\nand others.\n\nA large share of its attacks use a Trojan called Ursnif, but it’s not clear whether it controls\nUrsnif or is just one of the groups using it. The malware stems from leaked source code and\nis used by many other threat actors.\n\nOne of TA544’s distinctive traits is how is uses steganography, hiding malicious code in\nseemingly benign images.\n\n## TA573: a top-tier distributor with ties to Evil Corp\n\nLike other illicit markets, cyber crime is a loose, multilayered ecosystem that includes\nsuppliers, distributors, money launderers and other specialties. TA573 operates as a\nmalware “affiliate,” which sends malware someone else has created.\n\nThink of affiliates as the last mile of the malware supply chain. They don’t write malware or\nrun the infrastructure used to support attacks. Instead, they’re the malware distributor,\nselecting targets and crafting emails designed to trick recipients into engaging with them.\nCyber criminals’ business models vary, but affiliates typically get a commission on every\nvictim infected.\n\nTA573 is an affiliate distributor of Dridex, a malware strain that resurged in 2020 after a lying\nlow through most of 2019. The malware itself is a creation of a Russian cyber crime group\nthat calls itself Evil Corp,6 a longtime menace that recently turned to ransomware.7 In June,\nU.S. authorities offered $5 million for information leading to the arrest of Evil Corp’s\noperators, the largest reward ever for a cyber criminal.\n\n## TA800 holds healthcare data hostage\n\n\n-----\n\nThis attacker is an affiliate distributor of the The Trick, also known as Trickbot, and\nBazaLoader. (For more on how affiliates work, see the description of TA573).\n\nTA800 has targeted a wide range of industries in North America, infecting victims with\nbanking Trojans and malware loaders (malware designed to download other malware onto a\ncompromised device). Malicious emails have often included recipients’ names, titles and\nemployers along with phishing pages designed to look like the targeted company. Lures have\nincluded hard-to-resist subjects such as related to payment, meetings, termination, bonuses\nand complaints in the subject line or body of the email.\n\nIn Q4, it was responsible for a wave attacks against the healthcare sector using a loader\ncalled BazaLoader. BazaLoader, under the control of a separate threat actor, subsequently\ninstalled a ransomware strain called Ryuk. (Some researchers believe BazaLoader was\ncreated by the same malware team behind The Trick—in part because both malware strains\ninfected victims with Ryuk.)\n\nRansomware encrypts data on infected devices, effectively locking victims out of their data\nand systems until they pay the attacker to regain access.\n\nHealthcare organizations have become an especially enticing target for ransomware attacks.\nThey are often not as well protected as other sectors and the life-and-death nature of the\nbusiness means they can afford little downtime.\n\nThree U.S. government agencies warned hospitals in October of an “increased and\nimminent” cyber crime threat that included ransomware attacks.8\n\n## TA574: a new entrant draws on legacy malware\n\nA relative newcomer, TA574 appears to be another affiliate focused on malware distribution.\n(For more on how affiliates work, see the description of TA544).\n\nTA574 has launched attacks against a wide range of industries, sending an updated version\nof 15-year-old banking Trojan called Zloader. It’s an offshoot of the infamous Zeus banking\nTrojan, which has been used to steal millions of dollars from victims’ banking accounts.\n\nThe group also uses Ostap, a malware downloader that uses JavaScript to hide itself from\nsecurity sandbox analysis tools (see the “Top Attack Techniques” section for more on\nsandbox evasion).\n\n## Attribution: the known unknowns\n\nAs noted earlier in this section, Figure 1 includes only attacks that can be tied to a known\nthreat actor. This focus is helpful but may make the universe of attackers seem more\nconcentrated than it actually is.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs Figure 2 shows, nearly 90% of campaign-related email volume we saw in Q4 can t be\nattributed to known attackers. (That figure is even higher for email that is not part of a\ncampaign.)\n\n_Figure 3_\n\nIt’s easy to see why. Would-be hackers with little technical skill can easily access the\nmalware and infrastructure they need for successful campaigns, greatly lowering barriers to\nentry. And as explained in the last section, many attacks don’t require these tools at all—just\na keen understanding of human nature and a knack for persuasion.\n\nIt’s a testament to the breadth and diversity of today’s threat landscape—and a reminder\nthat organizations looking to protect their users, data and systems must be prepared for\nanything.\n\n## Conclusion and Recommendations\n\nToday’s attacks target people, not infrastructure. That’s why you must take a people-centric\napproach to cybersecurity. That includes user-level visibility into vulnerability, attacks and\nprivilege and tailored controls that account for individual user risk.\n\nHere’s what we recommend as a starting point.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Train users to spot and report malicious email. Regular training and simulated**\nattacks can stop many attacks and help identify people who are especially vulnerable.\nThe best simulations mimic real-world attack techniques. Look for solutions that tie into\nreal-world attack trends and the latest threat intelligence.\n**At the same time, assume that users will eventually click some threats. Attackers**\nwill always find new ways to exploit human nature. Find a solution that spots and\nblocks inbound email threats targeting employees before they reach the inbox. Invest in\na solution can manage the entire spectrum of email threats, not just malware-based\n[threats. Some threats—including business email compromise (BEC) and other forms of](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/business-email-compromise)\n[email fraud—can be hard to detect with conventional security tools. Your solution](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/cybersecurity-essentials/cybersecurity-education-series-what-email-fraud)\nshould analyze both external and internal email—attackers may use compromised\naccounts to trick users within the same organization. Web isolation can be a critical\nsafeguard for unknows and risky URLs.\n**Manage access to sensitive data and insider threats. A cloud access security**\nbroker can help secure cloud accounts and help you grant the right levels of access to\nusers and third-party add-on apps based on the risk factors that matter to you. Insider\n[risk management platforms can help protect against insider threats, including users](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/premium-security-services/insider-threat-management-services)\ncompromised by external attacks\n**Partner with a threat intelligence vendor. Focused, targeted attacks call for**\nadvanced threat intelligence. Leverage a solution that combines static and dynamic\ntechniques at scale to detect new attack tools, tactics, and targets—and then learns\nfrom them.\n\n1 Europol. “World’s Most Dangerous Malware Emotet Disrupted Through Global Action.”\n\nJanuary 2021.\n\n\n2 U.S. Department of Justice. “Emotet Botnet Disrupted in International Cyber Operation.”\n\nJanuary 2021.\n\n3 Danny Palmer (ZDNet). “Emotet: The world's most dangerous malware botnet was just\n\ndisrupted by a major police operation.” January 2021.\n\n\n4 Catalin Cimpanu (ZDNet). “Authorities plan to mass-uninstall Emotet from infected hosts on\n\nApril 25, 2021.” January 2021.\n\n5 Andy Greenberg (Wired). “Cops Disrupt Emotet, the Internet's ‘Most Dangerous Malware.’”\n\nJanuary 2021.\n\n\n6 Krebs on Security. “Inside ‘Evil Corp,’ a $100M Cybercrime Menace.” December 2019.\n\n7 BBC. “Russian hacker group Evil Corp targets US workers at home.” June 2020.\n\n\n8 Nationals Cyber Awareness System. “Alert (AA20-302A): Ransomware Activity Targeting\n\nthe Healthcare and Public Health Sector.” October 2020.\n\n\n-----",
