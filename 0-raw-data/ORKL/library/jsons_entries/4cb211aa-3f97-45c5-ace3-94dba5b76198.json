    "plain_text": "# Easy Way In? 5 Ransomware Victims Had Their Pulse Secure VPN Credentials Leaked\n\n**[ke-la.com/easy-way-in-5-ransomware-victims-had-their-pulse-secure-vpn-credentials-leaked/](https://ke-la.com/easy-way-in-5-ransomware-victims-had-their-pulse-secure-vpn-credentials-leaked/)**\n\nDecember 3, 2020\n\nRising ransomware attacks around the world, together with the recent lists of exposed Pulse\nSecure VPN credentials set the backdrop for KELA’s latest research. While not all\nransomware attacks used CVE-2019-11510 (a vulnerability of unpatched Pulse Secure VPN\nservers) or the previously shared credentials to the compromised corporate networks, it does\nadd another layer to the analysis of possible initial infection vectors used in ransomware\nincidents. Moreover, the recent exposure of credentials to nearly 50,000 vulnerable Fortinet\nVPNs raises further concern of possible infection vectors that can be used for ransomware\nattacks.\n\nOur key findings include:\n\n**Five victims of ransomware attacks whose credentials to their Pulse Secure VPN**\n**servers were exposed as part of two Pulse Secure VPN lists (i.e., directories with**\nfolders and files) that were shared by malicious actors in August 2020.\n**Data of three of the victims were leaked to ransomware gangs’ blogs in an**\n**attempt to** **[force them to pay a ransom. Based on KELA’s conversation with threat](https://ke-la.com/how-ransomware-gangs-find-new-monetization-schemes-and-evolve-in-marketing/)**\nactors related to the attack, at least one victim (unnamed) paid the ransom.\nA threat actor involved in the attack confirmed that they gained initial access to at\n**least one compromised network via the CVE-2019-11510.**\nProactive monitoring of darknet threats, such as the Pulse Secure VPN lists, helps\nenterprise defenders secure their networks and prevent further, more sophisticated\nattacks, such as ransomware attacks.\n\n## Exploiting the CVE-2019-11510\n\nA vulnerability in Pulse Secure VPN servers, tracked as CVE-2019-11510, is one of the most\npopular flaws exploited by ransomware gangs to deploy encrypting malware. Travelex, for\n[example, is among the victims compromised through this flaw.](https://doublepulsar.com/big-game-ransomware-being-delivered-to-organisations-via-pulse-secure-vpn-bd01b791aad9)\n\nThe ransomware operators or their affiliates often use vulnerabilities to gain access to the\ntargeted network, escalate privileges, move laterally, and eventually infect the system with\nransomware. In some cases, the operators don’t exploit the vulnerabilities by themselves —\n[instead, they buy so-called network access from initial access brokers who had already](https://ke-la.com/kelas-100-over-100-september2020-in-network-access-sales/)\nexploited the flaws, gained privileges, and now sell access via RDP, VPN, or other means.\n\n\n-----\n\nA recent incident involving the disclosure of Pulse Secure credentials created an opportunity\nto analyze the CVE-2019-11510 exploitation’s internal procedures. As we reported in August\n2020, a list of plaintext usernames and passwords, along with IP addresses of more than\n900 Pulse Secure VPN enterprise servers, was posted on a Russian-speaking underground\nforum (we’ll call it the first Pulse Secure list).\n\nDarknet chatter indicates the information circulated among malicious actors even before\nsharing the list. But it doesn’t mean threat actors were sharing this list; It’s more likely that\nthe actors compiled lists based on open-source research and an automated script\nweaponizing CVE-2019-11510. For example, a few days after the original list was shared,\nanother threat actor shared an archive of credentials to vulnerable Pulse Secure VPNs (the\nsecond Pulse Secure list).\n\n_A threat actor shares a “similar archive” collected over 45 days_\n\nThis second list featured more than 300 IP addresses; however, only 131 items were unique\ncompared to the first leak. This finding proves that multiple threat actors targeted the same\ncompanies through vulnerable Pulse Secure VPN servers, tracing victims through opensource tools, specifically Shodan. Out of five victims discussed in this post, two still have\ntheir IPs present in Shodan results when using the same dork as threat actors looking for a\nPulse Secure VPN server.\n\n\n-----\n\n_An initial access broker, who’s primary TTPs include exploiting CVE-2019-11510, describes searching for_\n_other vulnerable targets – create a tailored search query on Shodan, export the retrieved addresses and_\n_use a public exploit against the vulnerability._\n\nThese findings confirm that multiple threat actors might target vulnerable companies for\ndifferent purposes, including ransomware deployment.\n\n## The Victims\n\nKELA discovered five recent ransomware victims in the Pulse Secure lists, indicating that\nthese victims’ initial infection vector could be credentials obtained either from the lists or\nindependently through the same vulnerability. Victims were attacked by different ransomware\ngangs: Egregor, LockBit, Sodinokibi, Maze, and an unknown group. The incidents illustrate\nhow an unpatched Pulse Secure flaw can result in successful, lucrative ransomware attacks.\n\n**American Video Delivery Solutions Provider**\n\nOn August 30, an initial access broker and a known collaborator of the Sodinokibi\nransomware gang listed a new victim on their Twitter account: an American video delivery\nsolutions provider.\n\n\n-----\n\nA few days later, the broker contacted KELA offering proof of a successful ransomware\nattack. He said he plans to post the stolen data on a well-known Russian-speaking\nunderground forum.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn IP belonging to the company appeared in the first Pulse Secure list. Answering KELAs\nquestions, the broker confirmed he used CVE-2019-11510 to obtain access to the\n[compromised network. He claimed to work with Lalartu, a well-known affiliate of Sodinokibi,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sodinokibi-ransomware-builds-an-all-star-team-of-affiliates/)\nsuggesting that he sold the initial access to this affiliate.\n\nUnfortunately, in this scenario, as stated by the broker, the ransomware operators eventually\nreceived the ransom, amounting to $100K- $300K. The broker probably took a share and\ndidn’t sell it for the fixed price since he made significant efforts to intimidate the victim and\nforce them to pay. In a [recent interview, Sodinokibi acknowledged their affiliates receive 70-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQCQ1VZp8s&feature=youtu.be)\n80% of the ransom, meaning a potential gain of $70K-$240K in this attack.\n\n_The broker shares details of the attack with KELA, probably attempting to pressure the victim_\n\n**Barnes & Noble**\n\nFive IP addresses of Barnes & Noble were present in both Pulse Secure lists, implying the\n[company was vulnerable to CVE-2019-11510. In October 2020, the company disclosed it](https://www.wbir.com/article/news/nation-world/barnes-noble-says-cyberattack-may-have-exposed-customer-info/507-8a448e8b-c394-4f60-bf75-1fb0bfb0ec8d)\nwas a victim of a ransomware attack. The Egregor ransomware gang, which emerged in\nSeptember 2020 as a possible successor to Sekhmet, claimed responsibility for the attack on\nits blog.\n\nWhile the initial infection vector in this attack remains unknown, Barnes & Noble’s Pulse\nSecure VPN credentials were already exposed in the darknet three months ago. Attackers\nobtained the credentials using the CVE-2019-11510 vulnerability, which means that at some\npoint, the company had unpatched Pulse Secure VPN servers. This initial hypothesis was\nlater revoked when an actor involved in the attack shared that he did not exploit vulnerable\nPulse Secure credentials in order to access Barnes & Noble’s network.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SK Hynix**\n\nMaze attacked the South Korean memory and semiconductor manufacturer SK Hynix, one of\nthe world’s top hardware companies reporting $22 billion in revenue, in August 2020. The\nattackers stole documents, including emails relating to price negotiations with clients like\nApple and IBM. The company had one IP in the Pulse Secure list – in Italy, where the\ncompany’s European R&D Centre is situated. While no details of the attack are known,\n[exploitation of CVE-2019-11510 is among Maze’s TTPs.](https://www.kroll.com/en-ca/insights/publications/cyber/latest-maze-ransomware-ttps)\n\n**A Vietnamese IT Corporation**\n\nBased on confidential information obtained by KELA, a Vietnamese IT corporation suffered a\nransomware incident in August 2020. Two of the company’s IP addresses were exposed in\nthe Pulse Secure lists, one of them present in both lists – suggesting several threat actors\nmight target it. Based on TTPs used in the attack, Maze could be responsible, although the\nransomware gang has not mentioned the company online, and there were no media reports\nof the incident.\n\n**Japanese Manufacturing Company**\n\nLockBit ransomware operators launched an attack against this Japanese manufacturing\ncompany. The gang first exposed the victim in a thread on a Russian-speaking underground\nforum, listing a .cn domain, indicating the target was a Chinese branch. A few days later,\nLockBit listed the victim on their blog without mentioning any domain names.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The victim announced in the LockBit’s thread_\n\n_The victim shared on the LockBit’s website_\n\nWhile malicious actors often leverage Pulse Secure flaws to launch ransomware attacks, we\nusually discover the initial infection vector after the incident occurred and the investigation\nhas been concluded.\n\nHowever, as our post indicates, it is possible to prevent some intrusions by regularly\nmonitoring darknet forums and repositories in order to detect potential threats to\norganizations. Organizations globally are continually threatened by the exposure and\nongoing circulation of their sensitive credentials that are posted on the web. Taking into\nconsideration the nature of the underground ecosystem, the credentials exposed in recent\ninstances (such as the exposures of the Pulse Secure VPNs and Fortinet VPNs) will likely\ncontinue to be leveraged for more crucial cyber-attacks, creating a greater need for\nenterprise defenders to monitor weakness in their networks and exposure of their data in the\nDark Net\n\n\n-----",
