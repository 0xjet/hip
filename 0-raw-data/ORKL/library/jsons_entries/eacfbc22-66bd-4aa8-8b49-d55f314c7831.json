cryptominers\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-zingostealer-infostealer-drops-more-malware-cryptominers/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-zingostealer-infostealer-drops-more-malware-cryptominers/)**\n\nBill Toulas\n\nBy\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nApril 14, 2022\n02:10 PM\n0\n\nA new information-stealing malware called ZingoStealer has been discovered with powerful\ndata-stealing features and the ability to load additional payloads or mine Monero.\n\nThe new malware was created and released for free by a group of threat actors named the\n\"Haskers Gang,\" who recently attempted to sell its source code for $500.\n\n[Soon after researchers at Cisco Talos spotted that offering, ZingoStealer changed hands](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/04/haskers-gang-zingostealer.html)\nand was transferred to a new threat actor who will undertake the development effort.\n\nConsidering that the adversaries offer the info-stealer for free on both their Telegram and\nDiscord channels, and given the growing demand for this type of malware, its deployment\ncould rise to new levels.\n\n\n-----\n\n## An aggressive malware\n\nThe ZingoStealer first appeared in the cybercrime community in March 2022, promoted in\nRussian-speaking channels as a \"ready-to-use,\" powerful info-stealer in the form of a .NET\nexecutable.\n\nFor only 300 rubles, worth approximately $3.64 at today's prices, users could also buy the\npre-built option that featured crypter obfuscation (via ExoCrypt) for upgraded resistance to\nAV detection.\n\nSo far, ZingoStealer has been seen infecting computers via software cracks, and video\n[game cheats promoted on YouTube, but the infection vector could diversify at any moment.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-valorant-cheats-on-youtube-infect-you-with-redline-stealer/)\n\n**CSGO cheat delivering ZingoStealer promoted on YouTube** _(Cisco)_\nFrom a data-stealing perspective, this is a potent malware targeting the following apps and\ndata points:\n\n**Web browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Opera GSX**\n**Cryptocurrency wallet extensions: TronLink, Nifty Wallet, MetaMask, MathWallet,**\nCoinbase Wallet, Binance Wallet, Brave Wallet, Guarda, EQUAL Wallet, BitApp\nWallet, iWallet, Wombat – Gaming Wallet\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cryptocurrency wallet data: Zcash, Armory, Bytecoin, Jaxx Liberty, Exodus,**\nEthereum, Electrum, Atomic, Guarda, Coinomi\n**Cryptocurrency wallets: Bitcoin, Dash, Litecoin**\n**Computer information: IP address, Computer name, Username, OS version,**\nLocalization information, Processor information, System memory, Screen resolution,\nStart time\n\nAll stolen info is saved in the \"C:\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\GinzoFolder\" folder, zipped, and\nexfiltrated to the operator's server.\n\n**Exfiltrating the ZIP file** _(Cisco)_\nWhile the targeting list may appear extensive, it pales compared to the programs targeted\nby other, more established info-stealers, most notably, the RedLine Stealer.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Comparison of the**\n\n**two info-stealers** _(Cisco)_\nThe simple solution to cover this gap in features is to have ZingoStealer deploy RedLine\nStealer, which in fact, is its most frequently deployed second-stage payload.\n\nZingoStealer performs a geolocation check to ensure the victim isn't located in a CIS\ncountry, as it's predominately used by Russian-speaking actors, and then requests a list of\nURLs for the retrieval and execution of more payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Second-stage payload list retrieval** _(Cisco)_\nIn addition to the above, ZingoStealer also features the XMRig cryptocurrency mining\nmalware to use the victim's computer for direct financial profit.\n\nThis feature was added in a recent release, and uses PowerShell to add the necessary\nexclusions on Windows Defender and execute the miner.\n\n**Mining pool growing as ZingoStealer infections increase** _(Cisco)_\n\n## ZingoStealer's future\n\n\n-----\n\nZingoStealer is new, and its future is uncertain and volatile, but the fact that hackers can\ngrab it for free and deploy it without limitations makes it a candidate for becoming a\nprevalent threat.\n\nThe competition in the field is now fierce as the information-stealer malware space has\nbecome quite crowded lately, but if the new owners prove themselves capable,\nZingoStealer will continue to grow.\n\nGiven its malware loading capabilities and the custom crypter that gives it stealthiness, it\nwouldn't be surprising to see it abandon its info-stealing aspirations and evolve into a\nspecialized loader.\n\nAs for how to protect against it, avoiding infections by not downloading software cracks and\ngaming cheats from shady websites would be the best approach.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Fake Binance NFT Mystery Box bots steal victim's crypto
