Naikon was mentioned because of its role in what\nturned out to be a unique and surprising story about payback. It was a Naikon attack on a\nHellsing-related organization that first introduced us to the Hellsing APT. Considering the\nvolume of Naikon activity observed and its relentless, repeated attack attempts, such a\nconfrontation was worth looking into, so we did.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe #NaikonAPT group was spear-phished by an actor we now call Hellsing\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fthe-naikon-apt%2F69953%2F&text=The+%23NaikonAPT+group+was+spear-phished+by+an+actor+we+now+call+%26%238220%3BHellsing%26%238221%3B)\n\nThe Naikon APT aligns with the actor our colleagues at FireEye recently revealed to be\n[APT30, but we haven’t discovered any exact matches. It is hardly surprising that there is an](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2015/05/20081935/rpt-apt30.pdf)\nelement of overlap, considering both actors have for years mined victims in the South China\nSea area, apparently in search of geo-political intelligence.\n\nThe #NaikonAPT group has for 5 years mined victims, apparently in search of geopolitical intelligence\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fthe-naikon-apt%2F69953%2F&text=The+%23NaikonAPT+group+has+for+5+years+mined+victims%2C+apparently+in+search+of+geo-political+intelligence)\n\nThis Naikon report will be complemented by a follow-on report that will examine the Naikon\nTTP and the incredible volume of attack activity around the South China Sea that has been\ngoing on since at least 2010.\n\nNoteworthy operational and logistical characteristics of this APT include:\n\nAt least five years of high volume, high profile, geo-political attack activity\nGeographical focus – per-country, individual operator assignment and proxy presence\nDynamic, well organized infrastructure\nReliance on an externally developed, consistent set of tools comprising a full-featured\nbackdoor, a builder, and an exploit builder\nHigh success rate in infiltrating national organisations in ASEAN countries\n\n## Highly Focused and Effective Around the South China Sea\n\nIn the spring of 2014, we noticed an increase in the volume of attack activity by the Naikon\nAPT. The attackers appeared to be Chinese-speaking and targeted mainly top-level\ngovernment agencies and civil and military organizations in countries such as the\nPhilippines, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Singapore, Nepal,\nThailand, Laos and China.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Decoy\n\nAn attack typically starts with an email carrying an attachment that contains information of\ninterest to the potential victim. The document may be based on information from open\nsources or on proprietary information stolen from other compromised systems.\n\nThis bait “document”, or email attachment, appears to be a standard Word document, but is\nin fact an CVE-2012-0158 exploit, an executable with a double extension, or an executable\nwith an RTLO filename, so it can execute code without the user’s knowledge or consent.\nWhen the executable is launched, spyware is installed on the victim computer at the same\ntime as a decoy document is displayed to the user; fooling them into thinking they have\nsimply opened a document.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe Naikon tool of choice generates a special, small, encrypted file which is 8,000 bytes in\nsize, containing code to be injected into the browser along with configuration data. With the\nhelp of a start-up module, this whole file is injected into the browser memory and decrypts\nthe configuration block containing the following:\n\n\n-----\n\nC&C server\nPorts and path to the server\nUser-agent string\nFilenames and paths to its components\nHash sums of the user API functions\n\nThe same code then downloads its main body from the C&C server using the SSL protocol,\nloads it independently from the operating system functions and, without saving it to the hard\ndrive, hands over control to the XS02 function. All functionality is handled in memory.\n\n## Payload\n\nThe main module is a remote administration utility. Using SSL, the module establishes a\nreverse connection to the C&C server as follows: it sets up an outgoing connection to the\nC&C server and checks if there is a command that it should execute. If there is, it executes\nthe command and returns the result to the C&C. There are 48 commands in the module’s\nrepertoire, which a remote operator can use to effectively control the victim computer. This\nincludes taking a complete inventory, downloading and uploading data, installing add-on\nmodules, or working with the command line.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe main module supports 48 commands, which the attackers can use to control the\nvictim machine #NaikonAPT\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fthe-naikon-apt%2F69953%2F&text=The+main+module+supports+48+commands%2C+which+the+attackers+can+use+to+control+the+victim+machine+%23NaikonAPT)\n\nHere is the complete list of commands:\n\n0 CMD_MAIN_INFO\n\n1 CMD_PROCESS_REFRESH\n\n2 CMD_PROCESS_NAME\n\n3 CMD_PROCESS_KILL\n\n4 CMD_PROCESS_MODULE\n\n5 CMD_DRIVE_REFRESH\n\n6 CMD_DIRECTORY\n\n7 CMD_DIRECTORY_CREATE\n\n8 CMD_DIRECTORY_CREATE_HIDDEN\n\n9 CMD_DIRECTORY_DELETE\n\n10 CMD_DIRECTORY_RENAME\n\n11 CMD_DIRECOTRY_DOWNLOAD\n\n12 CMD_FILE_REFRESH\n\n13 CMD_FILE_DELETE\n\n14 CMD_FILE_RENAME\n\n15 CMD_FILE_EXECUTE_NORMAL\n\n16 CMD_FILE_EXECUTE_HIDDEN\n\n17 CMD_FILE_EXECUTE_NORMAL_CMD\n\n18 CMD_FILE_EXECUTE_HIDDEN_CMD\n\n19 CMD_FILE_UPLOAD\n\n20 CMD_FILE_DOWNLOAD\n\n21 CMD_WINDOWS_INFO\n\n22 CMD_WINDOWS_MESSAGE\n\n\n-----\n\n23 CMD_SHELL_OPEN\n\n24 CMD_SHELL_CLOSE\n\n25 CMD_SHELL_WRITE\n\n26 CMD_SERVICE_REFRESH\n\n27 CMD_SERVICE_CONTROL\n\n28 CMD_PROGRAM_INFO\n\n29 CMD_UNINSTALL_PROGRAM\n\n30 CMD_REGESTRY_INFO\n\n31 CMD_ADD_AUTO_START\n\n32 CMD_MY_PLUGIN\n\n33 CMD_3RD_PLUGIN\n\n34 CMD_REG_CREATEKEY\n\n35 CMD_REG_DELETEKEY\n\n36 CMD_REG_SETVALUE\n\n37 CMD_REG_DELETEVALUE\n\n38 CMD_SELF_KILL\n\n39 CMD_SELF_RESTART\n\n40 CMD_SELF_CONFIG\n\n41 CMD_SELF_UPDATE\n\n42 CMD_SERVER_INFO\n\n43 CMD_INSTALL_SERVICE\n\n44 CMD_FILE_DOWNLOAD2\n\n45 CMD_RESET\n\n46 CMD_CONNECTION_TABLE\n\n50 CMD_HEART_BEAT\n\n\n-----\n\nSeveral modifications of the main module exist.

In some\ncases, a direct connection was established between the victim computer and the C&C. In\nother cases, the connection was established via dedicated proxy servers installed on\ndedicated servers rented in third countries. In all likelihood, this additional setup was a\nreaction to the network administrators in some targets limiting or monitoring outbound\nnetwork connections from their organizations.\n\nHere is a partial list of C&C servers and victim locations, demonstrating the geo-specific\ncorrelation:\n\nID Jakarta linda.googlenow.in\n\nID Jakarta admin0805.gnway.net\n\nID Jakarta free.googlenow.in\n\n\n-----\n\nID frankhere.oicp.net\n\nID Bandung frankhere.oicp.net\n\nID Bandung telcom.dhtu.info\n\nID Jakarta laotel08.vicp.net\n\nJP Tokyo greensky27.vicp.net\n\nKH googlemm.vicp.net\n\nKH Phnom Penh googlemm.vicp.net\n\nMM peacesyou.imwork.net\n\nMM sayakyaw.xicp.net\n\nMM ubaoyouxiang.gicp.net\n\nMM Yangon htkg009.gicp.net\n\nMM kyawthumyin.xicp.net\n\nMM myanmartech.vicp.net\n\nMM test-user123.vicp.cc\n\nMY us.googlereader.pw\n\nMY net.googlereader.pw\n\nMY lovethai.vicp.net\n\nMY yahoo.goodns.in\n\nMY Putrajaya xl.findmy.pw\n\nMY Putrajaya xl.kevins.pw\n\nPH Caloocan oraydns.googlesec.pw\n\nPH Caloocan gov.yahoomail.pw\n\nPH pp.googledata.pw\n\nPH xl.findmy.pw\n\nPH mlfjcjssl.gicp.net\n\nPH o.wm.ggpw.pw\n\n\n-----\n\nPH oooppp.findmy.pw\n\nPH cipta.kevins.pw\n\nPH phi.yahoomail.pw\n\nSG Singapore xl.findmy.pw\n\nSG Singapore dd.googleoffice.in\n\nVN Hanoi moziliafirefox.wicp.net\n\nVN Hanoi bkav.imshop.in\n\nVN Hanoi baomoi.coyo.eu\n\nVN Dong Ket macstore.vicp.cc\n\nVN Hanoi downloadwindows.imwork.net\n\nVN Hanoi vietkey.xicp.net\n\nVN Hanoi baomoi.vicp.cc\n\nVN Hanoi downloadwindow.imwork.net\n\nVN Binh Duong www.ttxvn.net\n\nVN Binh Duong vietlex.gnway.net\n\nVN Hanoi www.ttxvn.net\n\nVN Hanoi us.googlereader.pw\n\nVN Hanoi yahoo.goodns.in\n\nVN Hanoi lovethai.vicp.net\n\nVN Hanoi vietlex.gnway.net\n\n## XSControl – the Naikon APT’s “victim management software”\n\nIn the Naikon scheme, a C&C server can be specialized XSControl software running on the\nhost machine. It can be used to manage an entire network of infected clients. In some cases,\na proxy is used to tunnel victim traffic to the XSControl server. A Naikon proxy server is a\ndedicated server that accepts incoming connections from victim computers and redirects\nthem to the operator’s C&C. An individual Naikon proxy server can be set up in any target\ncountry with traffic tunnelling from victim systems to the related C&C servers\n\nXSControl is written in .NET with the use of DevExpress:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nIts main capabilities are:\n\nAccept initial connections from clients\nProvide clients with the main remote administration module\nEnable them to remotely administer infected computers with the help of a GUI\nKeep logs of client activity\nKeep logs of operator activity\nUpload logs and files to an FTP server\n\nThe operator’s activity logs contain the following:\n\nAn XML database of downloaded files, specifying the time of operation, the remote\npath and the local path\nA database of file names, the victim computer registry keys for the folders and\nrequested sections\nA history of executed commands\n\n## Country X, Operator X\n\nNow let’s do an overview of one Naikon campaign, focusing on country “X”.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis revealed that the cyber-espionage campaign against country X had been going on\nfor many years. Computers infected with the remote control modules provided attackers with\naccess to employees’ corporate email and internal resources, and access to personal and\ncorporate email content hosted on external services.\n\nBelow is a partial list of organizations affected by Naikon’s “operator X’s” espionage\ncampaign in country X.\n\nOffice of the President\nMilitary Forces\nOffice of the Cabinet Secretary\nNational Security Council\nOffice of the Solicitor General\nIntelligence Services\nCivil Aviation Authority\nDepartment of Justice\nFederal Police\nExecutive/Presidential Administration and Management Staff\n\nA few of these organizations were key targets and under continuous, real-time monitoring. It\nwas during operator X’s network monitoring that the attackers placed Naikon proxies within\nthe countries’ borders, to cloak and support real-time outbound connections and data\nexfiltration from high-profile victim organizations.\n\nIn order to obtain employees’ credentials, operator X sometimes used keyloggers. If\nnecessary, operator X delivered them via the remote control client. In addition to stealing\nkeystrokes, this attacker also intercepted network traffic. Lateral movements included\ncopying over and remotely setting up winpcap across desktop systems within sensitive office\nnetworks, then remotely setting up AT jobs to run these network sniffers. Some APTs like\nNaikon distribute tools such as these across multiple systems in order to regain control if it is\nlost accidentally and to maintain persistence.\n\nThe #NaikonAPT group took advantage of cultural idiosyncrasies in its target countries\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fthe-naikon-apt%2F69953%2F&text=The+%23NaikonAPT+group+took+advantage+of+cultural+idiosyncrasies+in+its+target+countries)\n\nOperator X also took advantage of cultural idiosyncrasies in its target countries, for example,\nthe regular and widely accepted use of personal Gmail accounts for work. So it was not\ndifficult for the Naikon APT to register similar-looking email addresses and to spear-phish\ntargets with attachments, links to sites serving malware, and links to google drive.\n\n## The empire strikes back\n\n\n-----\n\nEvery once in a while the Naikon group clashes with other APT groups that are also active in\nthe region. In particular, we noticed that the Naikon group was spear-phished by an actor we\nnow call “Hellsing”. More details about the cloak and dagger games between Naikon and\nHellsing can be found in our blogpost: “The Chronicles of the Hellsing APT: The Empire\nStrikes Back“.\n\n**Read more about how you can protect your company against the Naikon threat actor**\n**[here](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/your-best-defense-against-one-of-the-most-active-apts-in-asia-whitelisting-heuristics-and-more/15066/)**\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Social engineering](https://securelist.com/tag/social-engineering/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Vulnerabilities and exploits](https://securelist.com/tag/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/)\n\nAuthors\n\n[Kurt Baumgartner](https://securelist.com/author/kurtb/)\n\n[Maxim Golovkin](https://securelist.com/author/maximgolovkin/)\n\nThe Naikon APT\n\nYour email address will not be published.
