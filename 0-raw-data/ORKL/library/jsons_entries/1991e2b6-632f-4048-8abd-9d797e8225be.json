He believes that the threat\nactors were testing a new version and forgot to remove it when it went live.\n\nFor those seeing this warning, Kremez advises that victims immediately disconnect their\ncomputer from the network and then perform a scan with their installed security software.\n\nOnce your computer has been cleaned, victims should change their passwords at any site,\nexternal or internal, whose credentials are saved in the browser or recently logged into from\nthe browser.\n\nIf a victim is on a corporate network, other computers may have also been compromised,\nand a thorough investigation should be undertaken.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Ukraine warns of “chemical attack” phishing pushing stealer malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-warns-of-chemical-attack-phishing-pushing-stealer-malware/)\n\n[Pixiv, DeviantArt artists hit by NFT job offers pushing malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pixiv-deviantart-artists-hit-by-nft-job-offers-pushing-malware/)\n\n[Google exposes tactics of a Conti ransomware access broker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-exposes-tactics-of-a-conti-ransomware-access-broker/)\n\n[New powerful Prynt Stealer malware sells for just $100 per month](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-powerful-prynt-stealer-malware-sells-for-just-100-per-month/)\n\n[New ZingoStealer infostealer drops more malware, cryptominers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-zingostealer-infostealer-drops-more-malware-cryptominers/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
