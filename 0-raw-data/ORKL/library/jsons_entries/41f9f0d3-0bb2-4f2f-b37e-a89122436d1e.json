However, a mitigation does not remedy a_**\n**_past or ongoing compromise. Systems should simultaneously be thoroughly analyzed per_**\n**_details in this post to look for signs of a breach._**\n\nDuring the second week of December 2023, Volexity detected suspicious lateral movement on\nthe network of one of its Network Security Monitoring service customers. Upon closer inspection,\nVolexity found that an attacker was placing webshells on multiple internal and external-facing web\nservers. These detections kicked off an incident response investigation across multiple systems\nthat Volexity ultimately tracked back to the organization's Internet-facing Ivanti Connect Secure\n(ICS) VPN appliance (formerly known as Pulse Connect Secure, or simply Pulse Secure). A\ncloser inspection of the ICS VPN appliance showed that its logs had been wiped and logging had\nbeen disabled. Further review of historic network traffic from the device also revealed suspect\noutbound and inbound communication from its management IP address. Volexity found that there\nwas suspect activity originating from the device as early as December 3, 2023.\n\nAt this point in its incident response investigation, Volexity suspected a zero-day exploit was likely\nat play but did not yet have enough evidence to support this theory. Volexity and its customer\nworked closely with Ivanti in order to obtain disk and memory images from the impacted devices.\nForensic analysis of the collected data provided insight into a variety of the attacker's tools,\nmalware, and methods for operating.\n\nMost notably, Volexity analyzed one of the collected memory samples and uncovered the exploit\nchain used by the attacker. Volexity discovered two different zero-day exploits which were being\nchained together to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). Through forensic\nanalysis of the memory sample, Volexity was able to recreate two proof-of-concept exploits that\nallowed full unauthenticated command execution on the ICS VPN appliance. These two\nvulnerabilities have been assigned the following CVEs:\n\nWhen combined, these two vulnerabilities make it trivial for attackers to run commands on the\nsystem. In this particular incident, the attacker leveraged these exploits to steal configuration\ndata, modify existing files, download remote files, and reverse tunnel from the ICS VPN\nappliance. Volexity observed the attacker modifying legitimate ICS components and making\nchanges to the system to evade the ICS Integrity Checker Tool. Notably, Volexity observed the\nattacker backdooring a legitimate CGI file (compcheckresult.cgi) on the ICS VPN appliance to\nallow command execution. Further, the attacker also modified a JavaScript file used by the Web\n\n\n-----\n\nSSL VPN component of the device in order to keylog and exfiltrate credentials for users logging\ninto it. The information and credentials collected by the attacker allowed them to pivot to a handful\nof systems internally, and ultimately gain unfettered access to systems on the network.\n\nThis blog post covers key findings from Volexity's forensic analysis and incident response\ninvestigation, as well as advice for detecting successful exploitation. Volexity currently attributes\nthis activity to an unknown threat actor it tracks under the alias UTA0178. Volexity has reason to\nbelieve that UTA0178 is a Chinese nation-state-level threat actor.\n\n## Incident Investigation\n\nVolexity's customer has permitted the sharing of this incident investigation in order to shed light\non the attacker's actions and potentially assist other organizations in jump-starting their\ninvestigations. Volexity used telemetry from its own Network Security Sensors, client EDR\nsoftware, and forensic data collected from multiple systems to paint a thorough picture of the\nattacker’s actions. As noted, Volexity's investigation did not start with the ICS VPN appliance, but\nboth forensic and network traffic analysis quickly led to that device. This allowed Volexity to zero\nin and scrutinize activity associated with the ICS VPN appliance.\n\nBelow are the highlights of Volexity’s observations when analyzing network traffic from ICS VPN\nappliances over the course of this incident:\n\nOutbound connections via curl to an IP Geolocation service via ip-api[.]com and to\nCloudflare's 1.1.1.1 IP address on multiple occasions\nReverse SOCKS proxy and SSH tunnel connections back through compromised Cyberoam\nappliances\nDownload of tooling from a compromised Cyberoam appliance\nReconnaissance of internal websites through proxied connections\nLateral movement using compromised credentials to connect to internal systems via RDP,\nSMB, and SSH\nTransfer of multiple webshell variants, which Volexity calls GLASSTOKEN, to Internetaccessible web servers and systems that were only internally accessible.\n\nOnce the ICS VPN appliance had been identified as compromised, Volexity collected key\n[evidence from it. This included data collected from the device using the Integrity Checking Tool](https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/KB44755?language=en_US)\nIvanti provides to identify mismatched files on the device. Customers are encouraged to open a\nsupport ticket with Ivanti in the event they see any signs of compromise, including new or\nmismatched files as identified by the Integrity Checker Tool. Volexity worked closely with Ivanti to\nobtain a decrypted version of the snapshot produced by the Integrity Checker Tool, as well as\nmemory and disk images. Over the course of the incident, Volexity obtained multiple memory and\ndisk images from multiple devices.\n\nVolexity used a combination of memory and disk forensics, combined with the results of the\nIntegrity Checker Tool, to quickly zero in on multiple malicious files placed on the compromised\nIvanti Connect Secure VPN appliance. Below is a list of key files Volexity identified*.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Filename** **Description** **Purpose**\n\n`/home/perl/DSLogConfig.pm` Modified Perl module Designed to\nexecute sessionserver.pl\n\n\n`/home/etc/sql/dsserver/sessionserver.pl` Perl script to remount\nthe filesystem with\nread/write access\n\n`/home/etc/sql/dsserver/sessionserver.sh` Script executed\nby sessionserver.pl\n\n\nMake sessionserver.sh\nexecutable, execute it, then\nrestore original mount settings\n\n\nUses regular expressions to\nmodify `compcheckresult.cgi` to\ninsert a webshell into it; also\ncreates a series of entries into\nfiles associated with the In-build\nIntegrity Checker Tool to evade\ndetection when periodic scans\nare run\n\n\nAllows remote code execution\nover the Internet if the attacker\ncan craft a requests with the\ncorrect parameters\n\n```\n/home/webserver/htdocs/danana/auth/compcheckresult.cgi\n\n```\n\nModified legitimate\ncomponent of the ICS\nVPN appliance, with\nnew Perl module\nimports added and a\none-liner to execute\ncommands based on\nrequest parameters\n\n\nModified to harvest entered\ncredentials and send them to a\nremote URL on an attackercontrolled domain\n\n```\n/home/webserver/htdocs/danana/auth/lastauthserverused.js\n\n```\n\nModified legitimate\nJavaScript\ncomponent loaded by\nuser login page of the\nWeb SSL VPN\ncomponent of ICS\n\n\n*Analysis of additional files is ongoing, and Volexity will update this blog post if necessary.\n\nVolexity also believes the attacker created and executed a number of files from the system's\n```\n/tmp/ directory that were no longer on disk at the time of analysis. Based on entries related to the\n\n```\nexclusions list designed to evade the In-build Integrity Checker Tool, Volexity believes the\nfollowing files were previously on disk at the following paths:\n```\n   /tmp/rev\n   /tmp/s.py\n   /tmp/s.jar\n   /tmp/b\n   /tmp/kill\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nBy carving files from the disk images, despite the file having been deleted, Volexity was able to\nrecover a Python-based proxy utility it believes was likely s.py. This was discovered to be a copy\n[of PySoxy, a SOCKS5 proxy written in Python, which is available on GitHub.](https://github.com/MisterDaneel/pysoxy/blob/master/pysoxy.py)\n\n## Malware, Tools, and Living off the Land\n\nWhile Volexity largely observed the attacker essentially living off the land, they still deployed a\nhandful of malware files and tools during the course of the incident which primarily consisted of\nwebshells, proxy utilities, and file modifications to allow credential harvesting. Once UTA0178 had\naccess into the network via the ICS VPN appliance, their general approach was to pivot from\nsystem to system using compromised credentials. They would then further compromise\ncredentials of users on any new system that was breached, and use these credentials to log into\nadditional systems via RDP. Volexity observed the attacker obtaining credentials in a variety of\nways, as detailed below:\n\nIn multiple instances, the attacker was able to use credentials they had compromised to log\ninto various workstations and servers and dump the memory of the LSASS process to disk\nusing Task Manager. The attacker then exfiltrated this output to extract further credentials\noffline.\nThe attacker was able to access a system containing Virtual Hard Disk backups, which\nincluded a backup of a domain controller. They mounted this virtual hard disk and extracted\nthe Active Directory database ntds.dit file from it, and compressed it using 7-Zip.\n[The attacker discovered an instance of Veeam backup software that was in use and used a](https://www.veeam.com/)\n[script available on GitHub to dump credentials from it.](https://github.com/sadshade/veeam-creds)\nAs previously noted, the attacker modified JavaScript loaded by the Web SSL VPN login\npage for the ICS VPN Appliance to capture any credentials entered in it.\n\nUsing this access in the network, Volexity largely observed mostly reconnaissance and\nexploration of systems by UTA0178. This primarily consisted of looking through user files,\nconfiguration files, and testing access to systems. The primary notable activity beyond that was\ndeployment of webshells to multiple systems. Volexity has not yet observed UTA0178 deploying\nany more advanced malware implants or persistence mechanisms outside of webshells. Below is\na summary of the type of webshell activity Volexity observed:\n\nThe attacker modified a legitimate ICS VPN component (compcheckresult.cgi) to support\nexecution of remote command.\nThe attacker deployed Version 1 of a webshell Volexity calls GLASSTOKEN to multiple\nInternet-accessible webservers.\nThe attacker deployed Version 2 of the GLASSTOKEN webshell to an internal, non-Internetaccessible server.\n\nOutside of the ability to execute commands on the ICS VPN appliance, these webshells appear to\nbe the primary method the attacker would rely on for persistent access to the network. Additional\ndetails on some of the various observed malware and tools are described below.\n\n\n-----\n\n### GLASSTOKEN: A Custom Webshell\n\nUTA0178 planted webshells on external-facing web servers in order to grant persistence to the\ncustomer environment. They could then use the webshells to execute commands on those\ndevices. Only two variations of the same webshell were used in the attack.\n\n**Version 1**\n\nThis version of the webshell has two code paths depending on the parameters present in the\n[request. The first code path is almost identical to the “tunnel” template present in ReGeorg, which](https://github.com/L-codes/Neo-reGeorg/blob/master/templates/tunnel.aspx)\nwas used to relay a connection. The second code path is a classic code execution case where\ncontent from the request parameters is decoded from hex and then base64 decoded before being\n[passed to Assembly.Load(). Based on evidence discovered, this was primarily used to execute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.assembly.load?view=net-8.0)\n[arbitrary PowerShell commands. The full code from the webshell is available here.](https://github.com/volexity/threat-intel/blob/main/2024/2024-01-10%20Ivanti%20Connect%20Secure/attachments/glasstoken_v1.aspx)\n\n**Version 2**\n\nThe second version of the webshell is almost exactly the same as the first, but it contains only the\nsecond code path to allow code execution. This version omits the native tunneling capability. The\n[full code for this version is available here.](https://github.com/volexity/threat-intel/blob/main/2024/2024-01-10%20Ivanti%20Connect%20Secure/attachments/glasstoken_v2.aspx)\n\n### JS Credential Theft\n\nAs previously mentioned, to gain access to user credentials the attacker modified the\nfile lastauthserverused.js, a legitimate component of the web app, modifying the \"Login\"\nfunction to POST user credentials to an attacker-controlled domain. This was done by adding the\nfollowing code to the beginning of the function:\n\nThis would result in a GET request from the user's browser back to the attacker website with the\nvictim's username and password being base64 encoded in the request.\n\n### visits.py modification\n\nThe attacker also modified another inbuilt component of Ivanti Connect Secure\nnamed visits.py.The code in this function is called whenever users\naccess /api/v1/cav/client/visits. The modification to this code was to add the following\nadditional code to the handler for POST requests:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Detecting Compromise\n\nThere are three primary methods organizations can use to detect activity associated with a\ncompromised Ivanti Connect Secure VPN appliance:\n\nNetwork traffic analysis\nVPN device log analysis\nExecution of the Integrity Checker Tool\n\nThe sections that follow describe what organizations can do to look for signs of compromise\nacross these different categories. Any of these methods can provide strong evidence that the ICS\nVPN appliance is compromised. Should signs of compromise be identified, the section titled\n_Responding to Compromise can be used for what to do next._\n\n### Network Traffic Analysis\n\nOne method organizations can use to look for signs of compromise is examine anomalous traffic\noriginating from their VPN appliances. This includes both traffic destined for the Internet from the\nappliance and traffic from it to systems internally. While these devices are configured to allow\nremote users access into the network, IP addresses assigned to VPN users are typically separate\nfrom IP addresses used by the VPN appliance itself. Organizations can examine outbound\nnetwork traffic from the VPN appliance to look for connections atypical of the device. From\nVolexity's Network Security Monitoring of client networks, it typically sees the VPN appliance\nconnect back to download.pulsesecure[.]net and to any other customer-configured integrations,\nsuch as to an SSO or MFA provider. Example activity that Volexity observed from compromised\nVPN appliances that was irregular include the following:\n\ncurl requests to remote websites\nSSH connections back to remote IPs\nEncrypted connections to hosts not associated with SSO/MFA providers or device updates\n\nFurther, Volexity was able to detect threat activity by observing inbound network traffic from IP\naddresses associated with the VPN appliances. There is likely an expected amount of internal\ntraffic associated with these devices for DNS services, directory integrations, and other related\ntraffic that should be consistently seen. However, other internal traffic that Volexity observed that\nwas not expected included the following:\n\nRDP and SMB activity to internal systems\nSSH attempts to internal systems\nPort scanning against hosts to look for systems with accessible services\n\nVolexity works with its customer to monitor their networks both internally and externally. At a\nminimum, any traffic analysis is likely to detect externally destined traffic. However, internal\nmonitoring or hunting can also be accomplished by leveraging endpoint detection and response\n(EDR) products should the attacker attempt to connect to a system running the software.\nSearching or monitoring EDR products for this activity is another method to detect this threat.\n\n\n-----\n\n### VPN Device Log Analysis\n\nAnother great method for detecting threats on ICS VPN appliances is to monitor its logs. The\ngood news is that these devices log quite a bit. These logs can be accessed via System ->\n**Log/Monitoring from the admin interface. The logs can then be viewed on the web or exported**\nfor offline analysis. A SYSLOG server can also be configured to ensure these logs are sent to\nanother destination and cannot be wiped or tampered with.\n\nVolexity recommends organizations enable the setting to log \"Unauthenticated Requests\". This\ncan be configured by accessing the Log Settings page under User Access from within\nthe Log/Monitoring page. With this setting configured, unauthenticated web requests made to the\nICS VPN appliance are recorded in the user logs. This can potentially help spot exploitation, data\nexfiltration, or other events related to an attacker attempting gain unauthorized access to the\n[device. In a previous blog post, Volexity covered how these logs could be used to observe](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2019/09/11/vulnerable-private-networks-corporate-vpns-exploited-in-the-wild/)\nexploitation of Pulse Secure appliances. In that case, attackers were taking advantage of a\nvulnerability to steal database files that contain credentials and session information.\n\nVolexity found the following cases to be useful for detecting compromise when examining logs\nfrom ICS VPN appliances:\n\n**Logs are wiped and/or disabled. In at least one case, Volexity observed the threat actor**\nclearing logs and disabling further logging. This can be a strong indicator of compromise,\nespecially if you know logging should be and was previously working.\n**Requests for files in valid but atypical paths. Unauthenticated request logging will**\ncapture requests made for any sort of web scanning. However, examining requests for valid\nICS VPN appliance paths that are valid but not commonly seen can be a potential indicator\nof compromise. On multiple occasions, Volexity observed the threat actor accessing files\nthey stored data exfiltration in via files found in the/dana-na/help/ directory.\n**Detections from the In-build Integrity Checker Tool. Starting with PCS 9.1R12, ICS VPN**\n[appliances have a built-in version of the integrity checker tool. This tool can be scheduled to](https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/KB44859)\nrun automatically and will log if new or mismatched files are detected. This can be an\nextremely strong indicator that your ICS VPN appliance is compromised. In the web\ninterface, under Event Logs in Log/Monitoring, these events will show up\nas SYS32039 and SYS32040. These IDs only show up in the web interface, will only\nappear as a \"critical\" event in the downloaded log, and will display text such as \"Integrity\n_Scan Completed: Detected 2 new files\". If any new or mismatched files are listed, the_\ndevice should be considered compromised.\n\nThe image below shows an example of what would be displayed in the web console if the In-build\nIntegrity Checker Tool finds new files (SYS32039). A similar message will be displayed if\nmismatched files are identified (SYS32040).\n\nNow for the bad news. At least as of the time of writing, the web requests associated with the\nexploits being used in the wild will not appear in the logs, even with the Unauthenticated Request\nsetting enabled. This means that you cannot tell from logs if the server is being exploited.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Executing the Integrity Checker Tool\n\nIn addition to the built-in version, Ivanti has an enhanced version of the Integrity Checker Tool that\ncan be run on ICS VPN appliances, which organizations can download. Once saved locally, the\ntool is run by uploading a package to the server and installing it as a Service Pack. The tool will\nthen run and display its results on screen. This includes whether or not any new or mismatched\nfiles are discovered. Note: Running the Integrity Checker Tool will reboot the ICS VPN\n**appliance, which will result in the contents of system memory largely being overwritten. If**\nyou have indicators of compromise prior to running this tool, it is recommended to not run the tool\nuntil you can collect memory and other forensic artifacts.\n\nThe image below shows an example of what it looks like when the Integrity Checker Tool is run\non a compromised system.\n\nAs highlighted in the image, a strong indicator of potential compromise can be seen in Steps 8\nand 9. These fields show values for \"Mis-matched Files = \" and \"Newly detected Files = \" that are\ngreater than 0. Once the ICS VPN appliance reboots, an encrypted snapshot of the unexpected\nfiles is saved and accessible for download. This file can be provided to Ivanti to be decrypted and\nwill contain an archival copy of the unexpected files identified.\n\n[Additional details about the tool, how to download it, and how deploy it can be found in KB44755.](https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/KB44755)\n\n## Responding to Compromise\n\nIf you discover that your ICS VPN appliance is compromised, it is important to take immediate\naction. You do not want to simply wipe and rebuild the ICS VPN appliance. Collecting logs,\nsystem snapshots, and forensics artifacts (memory and disk) from the device are crucial. Pivoting\nto analyzing internal systems and tracking potential lateral movement should be done as soon as\npossible. Further, any credentials, secrets, or other sensitive data that may have been stored on\nthe ICS VPN appliance should be considered compromised. This may warrant password resets,\nchanging of secrets, and additional investigations.\n\nVolexity strongly recommends that organizations look for signs of lateral movement internally\nfrom their ICS VPN appliance that is not consistent with expected behavior from the device.\nProactive checks of any externally facing infrastructure may also be warranted if internal visibility\nis limited.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf any organization needs assistance validating or responding to a breach, please feel free to\n[contact Volexity for breach assistance.](https://www.volexity.com/company/contact/breach-assistance/)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs organizations continue to improve and harden their defense, attackers are continually looking\nfor ways to bypass them. Internet-accessible systems, especially critical devices like VPN\nappliances and firewalls, have once again become a favorite target of attackers. These systems\noften sit on critical parts of the network, cannot run traditional security software, and typically sit at\nthe perfect place for an attacker to operate. Organizations need to make sure they have a\nstrategy in place to be able to monitor activity from these devices and quickly respond if\nsomething unexpected occurs.\n\nIt is critically important that organizations immediately apply the available mitigation from Ivanti\nand the patch that will follow. However, applying mitigations and patches will not resolve past\ncompromise. It is important that organizations running ICS VPN appliances review their logs,\nnetwork telemetry, and Integrity Checker Tool results (past and present) to look for any signs of\nsuccessful compromise.\n\n**Value** **Entity_type** **Description**\n\n206.189.208.156 ipaddress DigitalOcean IP address tied to UTA0178\n\ngpoaccess[.]com hostname Suspected UTA0178 domain discovered via domain\nregistration patterns\n\n\nwebbinstitute[.]com\n\n\nhostname Suspected UTA0178 domain discovered via domain\nregistration patterns\n\n\nsymantke[.]com hostname UTA0178 domain used to collect credentials from\ncompromised devices\n\n75.145.243.85 ipaddress UTA0178 IP address observed interacting with\ncompromised device\n\n47.207.9.89 ipaddress UTA0178 IP address observed interacting with\ncompromised device tied to Cyberoam proxy network\n\n98.160.48.170 ipaddress UTA0178 IP address observed interacting with\ncompromised device tied to Cyberoam proxy network\n\n173.220.106.166 ipaddress UTA0178 IP address observed interacting with\ncompromised device tied to Cyberoam proxy network\n\n73.128.178.221 ipaddress UTA0178 IP address observed interacting with\ncompromised device tied to Cyberoam proxy network\n\n50.243.177.161 ipaddress UTA0178 IP address observed interacting with\ncompromised device tied to Cyberoam proxy network\n\n\n-----\n\n**Value** **Entity_type** **Description**\n\n50.213.208.89 ipaddress UTA0178 IP address observed interacting with\ncompromised device tied to Cyberoam proxy network\n\n64.24.179.210 ipaddress UTA0178 IP address observed interacting with\ncompromised device tied to Cyberoam proxy network\n\n75.145.224.109 ipaddress UTA0178 IP address observed interacting with\ncompromised device tied to Cyberoam proxy network\n\n50.215.39.49 ipaddress UTA0178 IP address observed interacting with\ncompromised device tied to Cyberoam proxy network\n\n71.127.149.194 ipaddress UTA0178 IP address observed interacting with\ncompromised device tied to Cyberoam proxy network\n\n173.53.43.7 ipaddress UTA0178 IP address observed interacting with\ncompromised device tied to Cyberoam proxy network\n\nRelated indicators can also be downloaded from the Volexity GitHub page:\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nVolexity would like to acknowledge the Ivanti team for their support in helping with the discovery,\ntriage, and verification of the vulnerabilities discussed in this blog post.
