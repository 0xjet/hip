    "plain_text": "# State of Ransomware\n\n## Industry Update ANZ 2020\n\n\n-----\n\nThe increased reporting of cyber incidents among large companies in ANZ in the\nfirst half of 2020 has been clearly evident. A handful of ransomware families are\ndominating these attacks. In this paper, we investigate some of the tactics used\nby these ransomware families, their high profile victims, and the strategies used\nto defend against these threats.\n\nIt is not uncommon for many organisations to fail to report breaches, or worse,\nto be completely unaware that they have even taken place. Ransomware is\nbeing used for much more than just blackmail. It can be used as a diversion; first\nharvesting credentials for later use, and then encrypting the drive to keep IT staff\noccupied while the attacker covers their tracks.\n\nMore recently, attackers have accomplished even more nefarious objectives, like\nsending critical data to the dark web, or auctioning it to the highest bidder.\n\n### Everything as a service\n\n\n##### It is not uncommon for many organisations to fail to report breaches, or worse, to be completely unaware that they have even taken place.\n\n\nRansomware can be easily obtained and used by criminals that have little to no hacking skills, in what is known as\nRansomware as a Service (RaaS). By establishing a network of affiliate partners, malware authors are able to spread\ntheir ransomware widely and scale earnings dramatically in the process.\n\nMany threat actors have evolved from mass-volume consumer attacks, opting instead for more carefully planned\nand targeted attacks aimed at maximising disruption. By using a RaaS model, the authors of malware are\nsignificantly lowering the bar for launching such attacks, making this particular form of cybercrime accessible and\nprofitable for a larger pool of potential criminals.\n\n##### Many of our customers sought out BlackBerry because it is highly effective in preventing ransomware attacks.  In each case, BlackBerry was able to analyse, predict and prevent the threat, with no updates required, on average over 1000 days before the malware was first discovered in the wild.\n\n### ANZ in the headlines\nToll Group, the Melbourne based global logistics company, has been hit\ntwice by ransomware attacks in 2020 - in January by MailTo and in June\nby Nefilim. Also in June, government agency ServiceNSW, steel maker\nBlueScope, and a financial services company, MyBudget, all made the\nheadlines due to high-profile cyber-attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### True predictive prevention\nMany of our customers sought out BlackBerry because it is highly effective in preventing ransomware attacks.\nThe table below shows the BlackBerry advantage in relation to the most prominent ransomware families in ANZ. In\neach case, BlackBerry was able to analyse, predict and prevent the threat, with no updates required, on average over\n1000 days before the malware was first discovered in the wild[*].\n\nPhobos Ryuk Sodinokibi/ Zeppelin Ako Mailto Nefilim STOP/Djvu\nSodin/ Revil\n\nDec 2018 Aug 2018 April 2019 Nov 2019 Jan 2020 Aug 2019 March 2020 Dec 2018\n\nDiscovered\n\nBlackBerry 1229 Days 1340 Days 1343 Days 1496 Days 1000 Days 1567 Days 1448 Days 1714 Days\nAdvantage\n\nPredecessor CrySiS/ Hermes GandCrab VegaLocker/ Medusa Netwalker, Nemty Brand new\nDharma Buran/ Locker (Sept KoKo family family\n\nJamper/ 2019)\nDelphi\n\nDeployment Spam, RDP Spear Phish, Oracle MSSPs RDP Exploit/ Phishing, DLL RDP Exploit Cracks and\nCreds Exploit Weblogic, Stolen Creds Injection adware Exploits\n\nMSSP\n\nTargeting In- Large Large MSSPs High profile Large Large Large In- Large\ndiscriminate Businesses & their victims via Businesses Businesses & Businesses discriminate\n\n& customers MSSP and Institutions & &\nInstitutions Institutions Institutions\n\nRSA1024+ RSA4096+ Curve25519+ RSA4096+ RSA2048+ Curve25519+ RSA2048+ Salsa20\n\nAlgorithms AES256 AES256 Salsa20+ AES256 AES Salsa20+ AES128 ChaCha\n\nAES256 ChaCha\n\nExtensions .phobos .ryk random random random random .nefilim .djvu, .tro, random\nothers\n\nPayment 0.1-2 BTC 15-50 BTC 5-300 BTC unknown $3,000 Varies Varies + ~$1000 Varies +\nExfiltration\n\nContact us to find out how to minimise the risks of a ransomware breach by transitioning from a reactive to a\nprevention-first security posture.\n\n- source: SE Labs Report.
