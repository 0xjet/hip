Most recently, we](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/ransomware)\nobserved several relatively large email campaigns distributing the Kronos banking Trojan. In these\ncampaigns, though, Kronos acted as a loader with a new Point-of-Sale (POS) malware dubbed ScanPOS\nas the secondary payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese campaigns not only represent an uptick in our observed instances of Kronos banker but also a\nnew application of the malware that was first introduced in June 2014 and that we most recently\ndescribed in relation to campaigns targeting Canada [1].\n\n**Email Campaigns**\n\nOn November 10 and 14, Proofpoint observed several large email campaigns of tens of thousands of\nmessages each, targeting a range of verticals including hospitality, higher education, financial Services,\nand healthcare. The relative volumes by vertical are shown in Figure 1.\n\n_Figure 1: Vertical targeting across several campaigns_\n\nThese campaigns reached global audiences but primarily targeted the United Kingdom and North\nAmerica.\n\nThe email messages contained a document attachment or a link such as\n_hxxp://intranet.excelsharepoint[.]com/profile/Employee[.]php?id=[base64 encoded e-mail address]. This_\ndomain is under attacker control but pretends to be associated with Microsoft SharePoint. Clicking the\nlink causes the targeted user to download a malicious document (Fig. 2 and 3).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: E-mail containing malicious attachment only_\n\n_Figure 3: Email containing malicious attachment and link to malicious document_\n\nThe documents we observed contained a macro which downloaded Kronos [2] from a URL such as\n_hxxp://info.docs-sharepoint[.]com/officeup[.]exe . The Kronos payload had a command and control (C&C)_\nof hxxp://www.networkupdate[.]club/kbps/connect[.]php . The Kronos payloads received tasks to\ndownload at least three different payloads from the following URLs:\n\n_hxxp://networkupdate[.]online/kbps/upload/c1c06f7d[.]exe - Smoke Loader_\n_hxxp://networkupdate[.]online/kbps/upload/1f80ff71[.]exe - Smoke Loader_\n_hxxp://networkupdate[.]online/kbps/upload/a8b05325[.]exe - ScanPOS_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Malicious macro document with “Enable Content” lure_\n\nBoth Smoke Loader [3] payloads were configured to use\n_hxxp://webfeed.updatesnetwork[.]com/feedweb/feed[.]php as their C&C. So far we have not observed any_\nadditional payloads associated with these two Smoke Loader samples. However, as noted in the next\nsection, we have observed a ZeuS variant payload being downloaded by a different Smoke Loader\nsample using the same C&C.\n\nThe third payload we observed is a new Point-of-Sale (POS) malware called ScanPOS that is capable of\nexfiltrating via HTTP (Fig. 5) credit card numbers that are discovered by searching in the memory of\nrunning processes. This new POS variant only has a single, hard-coded C&C:\n_hxxp://invoicesharepoint[.]com/gateway[.]php. As with several other domains described here, these_\npretend to be associated with Microsoft SharePoint but are independent and under attacker control.\n\nExfiltrated data is base64 encoded and include:\n\nThe stolen track data\nThe process in which the data was found\nThe username\n\nPlease refer to the discovery article by our colleagues at Morphick for additional technical analysis on this\nnew POS variant [4].\n\n_Figure 5: ScanPOS exfiltrating CC data over HTTP_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Other Activity**\n\nIn a November 8 campaign that preceded this activity, we observed similar emails and URLs following the\nsame pattern as those used to deliver Kronos. However, in this campaign we observed links leading to\nRIG-v Exploit Kit (EK), followed by a redirect to ZIP-compressed .pif Smoke Loader and ZeuS. The links\nfollowed a pattern that was very similar to the more recent campaigns: hxxp://invoice.docs_sharepoint[.]com/profile/profile[.]php?id=[base64 e-mail address]. These links utilized an iframe to redirect_\npotential victims to a RIG-v instance located at add.souloventure[.]org as well as to /download.php on the\nsame server as the original link (Fig. 6).\n\n_Figure 6: Iframe redirect to RIG-v and payload download_\n\nUnfortunately, we did not observe any payloads delivered through this particular redirect chain. The\n/download.php returns an EmployeeID-47267.zip payload that we observed containing either a Smoke\nLoader variant using hxxp://webfeed.updatesnetwork[.]com/feedweb/feed[.]php as its C&C or a ZeuS\nvariant using hxxps://feed.networksupdates[.]com/feed/webfeed[.]xml as its C&C. In the instance where\nwe observed Smoke Loader, Smoke Loader downloaded an identical (same hash) ZeuS variant.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe campaigns distributing ScanPOS are heavily targeted at the hospitality vertical in North America and\nthe UK, among other countries that observe the Christmas and/or Thanksgiving holidays. With the\nholidays approaching and their associated heavy travel and shopping, organizations should be especially\nvigilant with respect to potential infection with POS malware, banking Trojans, and other malware that\nmay be used to exploit seasonal trends. We will continue to monitor Kronos campaigns, ScanPOS\ndistribution, and other threats as they emerge.\n\n**References**\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n\n**IOC**\n\nhxxp://invoice.docs-sharepoint[.]com/profile/profile[.]php?id=[base64 e-mail\naddress]\n\n\n**IOC**\n**Type** **Description**\n\nURL Phishing link\non Nov 8\n\n\nhxxp://invoice.docs-sharepoint[.]com/profile/download[.]php URL Redirect from\nphishing link\non Nov 8\n\n4b5f4dbd93100bb7b87920f2f3066782a8449eb9e236efc02afe570c1ce70cf5 SHA256 EmployeeID47267.zip\ncontaining\nSmokeLoader\nfrom\n/download.php\non Nov 8\n\n\n-----\n\n**IOC**\n\n\n**IOC**\n**Type** **Description**\n\n\n90063c40cb94277f39ca1b3818b36b4fa41b3a3091d42dfc21586ad1c461daa0 SHA256 SmokeLoader\nEmployeeID47267.pif\n\n711431204071b1e6f5b5644e0f0b23464c6ef5c254d7a40c4e6fe7c8782cd55c SHA256 EmployeeID47267.zip\ncontaining\nZeuS from\n/download.php\non Nov 8\n\n4ba3913d945a16c099f5796fdeef2fda5c6c2e60cb53d46a1bfae82808075d74 SHA256 ZeuS\nEmployeeID47267.pif\n\nhxxps://feed.networksupdates[.]com/feed/webfeed.xml URL ZeuS C&C on\nNov 8\n\nadd.souloventure[.]org Domain RIG-v domain\non Nov 8\n\n\nhxxp://intranet.excelsharepoint[.]com/profile/Employee[.]php?id=[base64 email address]\n\n\nURL Phishing link\non Nov 10\n\n\na78b93a11ce649be3ca91812769f95a40de9d78e97a627366917c4fcd747f156 SHA256 EmployeeID847267.doc\ndownloaded\nfrom phishing\nlinks on Nov\n10\n\nhxxp://info.docs-sharepoint[.]com/officeup[.]exe URL EmployeeID847267.doc\ndownloading\npayload\n(Kronos) on\nNov 10\n\ne3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 SHA256 Kronos on\nNov 10\n\nhxxp://www.networkupdate[.]club/kbps/connect[.]php URL Kronos C&C\non Nov 10\n\nhxxp://networkupdate[.]online/kbps/upload/c1c06f7d[.]exe URL Payload DL by\nKronos on\nNov 10\n\nhxxp://networkupdate[.]online/kbps/upload/1f80ff71[.]exe URL Payload DL by\nKronos on\nNov 10\n\nhxxp://networkupdate[.]online/kbps/upload/a8b05325[.]exe URL Payload DL by\nKronos on\nNov 10\n\n\n-----\n\n**IOC**\n\n\n**IOC**\n**Type** **Description**\n\n\nd0caf097ea0350dc92277aed73b0f44986d7d85b06d1d17b424dc172ce35a984 SHA256 c1c06f7d.exe SmokeLoader\n\nd9d1f02c8c4beee49f81093ea8162ce6adf405640ccacd5f03ce6c45e700ee98 SHA256 1f80ff71.exe SmokeLoader\n\nhxxp://webfeed.updatesnetwork[.]com/feedweb/feed[.]php URL SmokeLoader\nC&C\n\n093c81f0b234c2aa0363129fdaaaf57551f161915da3d23f43a792b5f3024c1e SHA256 a8b05325.exe\n\n                                     - ScanPOS\n\nhxxp://invoicesharepoint[.]com/gateway[.]php URL ScanPOS\nC&C\n\n\nhxxp://intranet.excel-sharepoint[.]com/doc/employee[.]php?id=[base64 e-mail\naddress]\n\n\nURL Phishing link\non Nov 14\n\n\nfd5412a7c71958ecdffa7064bf03c5f1931e561a1e71bc939551d5afb8bf7462 SHA256 downloaded\nfrom phishing\nlinks on Nov\n14\n\nhxxp://profile.excel-sharepoint[.]com/doc/office[.]exe URL EmployeeID6283.doc\ndownloading\npayload\n(Kronos) on\nNov 14\n\n269f88cfa9e9e26f3761aedee5d0836b5b82f346128fe03da28a331f80a5fba3 SHA256 Kronos on\nNov 14 (same\nC&C as\nprevious)\n\n**ET and ETPRO Suricata/Snort Coverage**\n\n2018125     ET CURRENT_EVENTS SUSPICIOUS .PIF File Inside of Zip\n\n2020077     ET TROJAN Kronos Checkin M2\n\n2020080     ET TROJAN Kronos Checkin\n\n2022124     ET TROJAN Win32.Sharik Microsoft Connectivity Check\n\n2022550     ET CURRENT_EVENTS Possible Malicious Macro DL EXE Feb 2016\n\n2023196     ET CURRENT_EVENTS RIG EK Landing Sep 12 2016 T2\n\n2023401     ET CURRENT_EVENTS RIG EK URI struct Oct 24 2016 (RIG-v)\n\n2816808     ETPRO CURRENT_EVENTS RIG EK Flash Exploit Mar 29 2016\n\n2823254     ETPRO TROJAN ScanPOS Exfiltrating CC Data\n\n2823288     ETPRO TROJAN Zeus Variant CnC SSL Cert\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
