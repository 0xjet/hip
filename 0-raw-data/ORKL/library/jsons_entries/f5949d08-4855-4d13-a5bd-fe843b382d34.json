More_\n_[information can be found here.](https://www.eset.com/us/black-hat-2017/)_\n\nThe 2016 attack on Ukraine’s power grid that deprived part of its capital, Kiev, of power for\n[an hour was caused by a cyberattack. ESET researchers have since analyzed samples of](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-cyber-attack-energy-idUSKBN1521BA)\nmalware, detected by ESET as Win32/Industroyer, capable of performing exactly that type\nof attack.\n\nWhether the same malware was really involved in what cybersecurity experts consider to\n[have been a large-scale test is yet to be confirmed. Regardless, the malware is capable of](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ukrainian-power-station-hacking-december-2016-report)\ndoing significant harm to electric power systems and could also be refitted to target other\ntypes of critical infrastructure.\n\nIndustroyer is a particularly dangerous threat, since it is capable of controlling electricity\nsubstation switches and circuit breakers directly. To do so, it uses industrial communication\nprotocols used worldwide in power supply infrastructure, transportation control systems,\nand other critical infrastructure systems (such as water and gas).\n\nThese switches and circuit breakers are digital equivalents of analogue switches;\ntechnically they can be engineered to perform various functions. Thus, the potential impact\nmay range from simply turning off power distribution, cascading failures and more serious\ndamage to equipment. The severity may also vary from one substation to another, as well.\nNeedless to say, disruption of such systems can directly or indirectly affect the functioning\nof vital services.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Win32/Industroyer: A new threat for industrial control systems](http://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Win32_Industroyer.pdf)\n\n[Download Research Paper](http://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Win32_Industroyer.pdf)\n\nIndustroyer’s dangerousness lies in the fact that it uses protocols in the way they were\ndesigned to be used. The problem is that these protocols were designed decades ago, and\nback then industrial systems were meant to be isolated from the outside world. Thus, their\ncommunication protocols were not designed with security in mind. That means that the\nattackers didn’t need to be looking for protocol vulnerabilities; all they needed was to teach\nthe malware “to speak” those protocols.\n\nThe recent power outage occurred on December 17th, 2016, almost exactly one year after\nthe [well-documented cyberattack that caused a blackout that affected around 250,000](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/04/blackenergy-trojan-strikes-again-attacks-ukrainian-electric-power-industry/)\nhouseholds in several regions in Ukraine on December 23rd, 2015.\n\nIn 2015, the perpetrators infiltrated the electricity distribution networks with the BlackEnergy\nmalware, along with KillDisk and other malicious components, and then abused legitimate\nremote access software to control operators’ workstations and to cut off power. Aside from\ntargeting the Ukrainian power grid, there are no apparent similarities in code between\nBlackEnergy and Industroyer.\n\n## Structure and key functionalities\n\nIndustroyer is modular malware. Its core component is a backdoor used by attackers to\nmanage the attack: it installs and controls the other components and connects to a remote\nserver to receive commands and to report to the attackers.\n\nWhat sets Industroyer apart from other malware targeting infrastructure is its use of four\npayload components, which are designed to gain direct control of switches and circuit\nbreakers at an electricity distribution substation.\n\nEach of these components targets particular communication protocols specified in the\n[following standards: IEC 60870-5-101,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60870-5#IEC_60870-5-101) [IEC 60870-5-104,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60870-5#IEC_60870-5-104) [IEC 61850, and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_61850) OLE for Process\nControl Data Access (OPC DA).\n\nGenerally, the payloads work in stages whose goals are mapping the network, and then\nfiguring out and issuing commands that will work with the specific industrial control devices.\nIndustroyer’s payloads show the authors’ deep knowledge and understanding of industrial\ncontrol systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware contains a few more features that are designed to enable it to remain under\nthe radar, to ensure the malware’s persistence, and to wipe all traces of itself after it has\ndone its job.\n\nFor example, the communication with the C&C servers hidden in Tor can be limited to nonworking hours. Also, it employs an additional backdoor – masquerading as the Notepad\napplication – designed to regain access to the targeted network in case the main backdoor\nis detected and/or disabled.\n\nAnd its wiper module is designed to erase system-crucial Registry keys and overwrite files\nto make the system unbootable and the recovery harder. Of interest is the port scanner that\nmaps the network, trying to find relevant computers: the attackers made their own custom\ntool instead of using existing software. Finally, yet another module is a Denial-of-Service\ntool that exploits the [CVE-2015-5374 vulnerability in Siemens SIPROTEC devices and can](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-15-202-01)\nrender targeted devices unresponsive.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nIndustroyer is highly customizable malware. While being universal, in that it can be used to\nattack any industrial control system using some of the targeted communication protocols,\nsome of the components in analyzed samples were designed to target particular hardware.\nFor example, the wiper component and one of the payload components are tailored for use\nagainst systems incorporating certain industrial power control products by ABB, and the\nDoS component works specifically against Siemens SIPROTECT devices used in electrical\nsubstations and other related fields of application.\n\nWhile in principle it’s difficult to attribute attacks to malware without performing an onsite\nincident response, it’s highly probable that Industroyer was used in the December 2016\nattack on the Ukrainian power grid. On top of the fact that the malware clearly possesses\nthe unique capabilities to perform the attack, it contains an activation timestamp for\nDecember 17th, 2016, the day of the power outage.\n\nThe 2016 attack on the Ukrainian power grid attracted much less attention than the attack\nthat occurred a year earlier. However, the tool most likely used, Win32/Industroyer, is an\nadvanced piece of malware in the hands of a sophisticated and determined attacker.\n\nThanks to its ability to persist in the system and provide valuable information for tuning-up\nthe highly configurable payloads, attackers could adapt the malware to any environment,\nwhich makes it extremely dangerous. Regardless of whether or not the recent attack on the\nUkrainian power grid was a test, it should serve as a wake-up call for those responsible for\nsecurity of critical systems around the world.\n\n_Additional technical details on the malware and Indicators of Compromise can be found in_\n_[our comprehensive white paper, and on](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Win32_Industroyer.pdf)_ _[github.
