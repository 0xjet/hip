    "plain_text": "# A STUDY OF MACHETE CYBER ESPIONAGE OPERATIONS IN LATIN AMERICA\n_Veronica Valeros, Maria Rigaki, Kamila Babayeva & Sebastian García_\nCzech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic\n\n{veronica.valeros, maria.rigaki}@aic.fel.cvut.cz; babaykam@fel.cvut.cz;\nsebastian.garcia@agents.fel.cvut.cz\n\n**ABSTRACT**\n\nReports on cyber espionage operations have been on the rise in the last decade. However, operations\nin Latin America are heavily under-researched and potentially underestimated. In this paper we\nanalyse and dissect a cyber espionage tool known as Machete. The results presented in this work are\nbased on the collection, reversing and analysis of Machete samples from 2011 to 2019. The large\ncollection of samples allowed us to analyse the malware’s evolution in detail and track changes in its\nfunctionality and structure, including modifi cations introduced as late as January 2019.\n\nOur research shows that Machete is operated by a highly coordinated and organized group that\nfocuses on Latin American targets. We describe the fi ve phases of the APT operations from delivery\nto exfi ltration of information and we show why Machete is considered a cyber espionage tool.\nFurthermore, our analysis indicates that the targeted victims belong to military, political or\ndiplomatic sectors. The review of the almost eight years of Machete operations shows that it is\nprobably operated by a single group whose activities may be state-sponsored. Machete is still active\nand operational to this day.\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\nCyber espionage is understood as the act of obtaining restricted information without permission\nusing software tools, such as malware. While traditional espionage [1] activities are diffi cult to\ndetect and study as they are typically covert operations, cyber espionage operations have more\noften been disclosed and studied. There is, however, a lack of research in this area in Latin\nAmerica. Very few cyber espionage campaigns have been discovered and studied in this region in\nthe last decade.\n\nNowadays, cyber espionage is conducted by groups often referred to as Advanced Persistent Threats\n(APTs). APT is the technical term used to identify economic or politically motivated groups that\nconduct cyber attacks persistently and effectively against a specifi c target. What distinguishes APTs\nfrom traditional attacks are their clear goals, specifi c targets, and long-term, highly organized\ncampaigns [2].\n\nIn this paper we present an in-depth analysis of the espionage activities of an APT group in Latin\nAmerica through the analysis of one of its cyber espionage tools known as Machete or Ragua.\nReports about Machete have been published previously in [3] and [4], however their results are based\non a subset of Machete samples, leaving unanswered questions about its long-term operations, the\nfunctionality of the malware in detail, and the attackers’ capabilities and operations as a whole. We\n\n\n-----\n\naim to provide an extensive overview of the malware and actors by analysing their operations from\ntheir beginning until today.\n\nOur research is based on a large corpus of Machete malware binaries that span eight years of\noperation. The malware corpus was processed, reverse engineered and dissected in order to obtain\nthe malware confi gurations, command-and-control servers and decoy documents used in the\ncampaigns. This information was used to identify the profi le of the targets, the regions affected by\nthe malware, and details of the malware infrastructure.\n\nWe show that the group behind Machete fi ts the description of an APT as it is running a long-term\noperation, it attacks specifi c targets and aims at strategic benefi ts. Based on the information extracted\nfrom the malware binaries we have been able to understand that Machete is targeting political and\nmilitary-related victims. The victims appear to be located in Central and South America and are\nprimarily Spanish speakers. Furthermore, our research indicates – due to the sharing of encryption\nkeys and overlapping network infrastructure – that there is likely one group operating the malware.\n\nThe main contributions of this paper include:\n\n - An in-depth analysis of Machete that complements and goes beyond previous reports. The\nanalysis is based on the largest collection of Machete binaries to date, which is three times as\nlarge as reported in previous work. The time span of the analysed samples is also broader and\nhas allowed the study of the attackers’ methods over time.\n\n - The most comprehensive collection to date of Machete hashes and decoy documents spanning\neight years of operations.\n\n - Discovery of new functionality based on reverse engineering analysis of Machete samples. Until\nnow it was not known that Machete was able to perform lateral movement within an infected\norganization. Our analysis showed that Machete can propagate via infection of USB drives. The\nuse of Dropbox as an exfi ltration method is also fi rst reported in this paper.\n\n - A qualitative analysis of the decoy documents based on language, topics and countries that sheds\nlight on potential victims and helps highlight the interests of the attackers when choosing their\ntargets.\n\n - A case study of the operations of an APT group that is active in a largely understudied part of the\nworld, namely Latin America.\n\n**PREVIOUS WORK**\n\nThis paper focuses on the cyber espionage activities of an APT group conducted in Latin America[1].\nThe study of this group is conducted by the analysis of one of its tools, known as Machete or Ragua.\n\nMachete was fi rst reported in 2014 [3], and subsequently in 2017 [4]. These reports give a general\noverview of the malware’s functionality, but they both focus on a small corpus of malware samples.\nBoth reports provide numbers of victims and countries, but no information is provided to verify these\nclaims. There is no supporting information as to where, when and how data about the victims was\ncollected. Additionally, while many of the sample hashes provided in these reports are publicly\navailable, not all of the samples can be accessed to verify the analysis.\n\n1 Latin America refers to territories in the Americas where the Spanish, Portuguese and French languages prevail.\nCommonly understood as all countries south of the United States.\n\n\n-----\n\nMachete was not the fi rst cyber espionage campaign in Latin America. In 2012, a report [5] described\na targeted attack dubbed ‘Operation Medre’. This targeted attack attempted to steal AutoCAD fi les\nfrom victim computers. The victims were primarily located in Peru, but other countries in the region\nwere also targeted. The type of espionage conducted by this APT group is considerably different\nfrom that conducted by the group behind Machete.\n\nIn 2015, a report [6] uncovered an APT group dubbed ‘Packrat’ targeting Latin American politicians,\njournalists and others. This group is believed to have been operating since 2008. There are\nsimilarities with Machete in the way this actor operates, the type of infrastructure used, and the use\nand themes of decoy documents. However, there are signifi cant differences in the tools used for\nespionage – in this case, known existing malware. There’s no evidence that the two actors are the\nsame. In 2018, a new report disclosed the use of remote access tools for espionage in Latin America\n\n[7]. While this attack presents some similarities with the Packrat group, the targeted audience and the\ntactics used were substantially different.\n\nIn early 2019, researchers uncovered a new ATP group, dubbed APT-C-36 [8], targeting companies\nand government agencies in Colombia. The tactics and techniques used differ signifi cantly from\nthose used by Machete.\n\nSeveral studies focus on the delivery mechanism used by APT groups. In [9], researchers present a\nstudy of decoy documents. The study shows how documents are socially engineered to match native\nlanguage, regional and thematic interests of the targets. This seems to be a common factor in all the\nAPTs targeting Latin America. Other studies of targeted attacks against NGOs [10] and individuals\n\n[11] also show the preference among attackers for using socially engineered suspicious links and\ndocuments.\n\n**METHODOLOGY**\n\nFor this research we used malware binaries, or samples, that contain Machete. In the fi rst stage of the\nresearch we aimed to obtain valid Machete samples to analyse. These samples were reverse\nengineered and studied to determine the malware characteristics, how they targeted their victims, and\nhow the malware evolved over time.\n\nThis research is based on a corpus of 105 Machete binaries and 63 decoy documents. The following\nsteps were carried out in order to obtain and create this large corpus of validated samples: fi rst, we\nsearched for and collected all possible Machete samples from public and private repositories; second,\nwe manually verifi ed that these samples were Machete samples; third, we identifi ed the structure and\nnesting of fi les to differentiate between fi rst-stage and second-stage binaries, their parents, and the\nindividual modules; fourth, we reversed engineered each fi le to obtain the source code of the\nmalware written in Python, its confi guration fi les, encryption keys, and the decoy documents used,\nwhen available.\n\nIn order to obtain samples of Machete, we fi rst relied on hashes from previous work [3, 4]. A total of\neight hashes were available from the fi rst report, and 27 initial decoys from the second report.\nHowever, not all of these were publicly available. An initial analysis of the fi les led to the\nidentifi cation of specifi c characteristics in the binaries, such as number of Portable Executable (PE)\nsections, PE comments, fi le structure, and the fi nal modules’ source code. These characteristics,\ncombined with specifi c anti-virus signatures, IP addresses and domain names, were used to expand\nthe search and identify more potential Machete samples in public and private repositories. Every\n\n\n-----\n\nbinary matching our indicators was downloaded for further manual classifi cation by a human analyst.\nAt the end of this stage the corpus of samples at our disposal had tripled the number of fi les reported\nin previous work.\n\nThe samples positively classifi ed as Machete were further processed. This workfl ow is illustrated in\nFigure 1.\n\n1. The fi rst step in this process consisted of identifying the parent. The malware is typically\ndistributed as an email attachment, therefore the attachment is considered a parent.\n\n2. Next, the parent was uncompressed to identify the fi rst stage of Machete.\n\n3. In the third step, the fi rst-stage malware was uncompressed to extract the second-stage\nmalware and the second-stage decoy document.\n\n4. The second-stage malware was further uncompressed to identify the malware libraries,\nmodules and confi guration fi les.\n\n5. Next, the modules were reverse engineered from PE fi les to Python compiled code.\n\n6. Finally, the Python compiled modules were decompiled to obtain the source code of the\nmalware, in Python.\n\n_Figure 1: Machete has a nested structure. The parent is what the victim receives (1). This fi le_\n_contains a fi rst executable fi le (2). The fi rst executable fi le contains the payload and the decoy_\n_document (3). The payload consists of six to eight modules (4), which can be further reverse_\n_engineered to obtain their source code (6)._\n\nThe reverse engineering of the modules consisted of obtaining the Python compiled code from the\nPE module using a tool called unpy2exe [12]. Once the Python compiled code (.pyc) was obtained,\n\n\n-----\n\nwe used a tool called uncompyle6 [13] to obtain the Python source code. This process is known as\ndecompilation.\n\nIn most cases the Python source code was obfuscated using a tool such as pyobfuscate [14], which\nmakes the source code diffi cult to read by renaming variables to nonsensical names and adding\ndummy clauses to increase ‘noise’. Reversing the obfuscation is a process known as deobfuscation.\nIn this case, deobfuscation was still possible, given that external library calls were not obfuscated and\nthe code was still able to run. No other anti-analysis or anti-debugging techniques were used among\nthe examined samples.\n\nAt the end of this process, an exhaustive corpus of 105 stage 2 Machete samples, along with 63\ndecoy documents and the source code of all modules for every sample, was available to continue the\nanalysis and research. The list of SHA256 hashes of decoy documents is shown in Appendix A; the\nlist of SHA256 hashes of stage 2 Machete samples is shown in Appendix B.\n\n**M ALWARE OPERATIONS**\n\nMachete is a piece of malicious software designed for Windows operating systems (32-bit). It is\ndistributed as a Portable Executable fi le compressed as a ZIP or RAR fi le. Machete is written in\nPython.\n\nAPT operations are highly coordinated and organized. They typically follow a common structure,\noften known as a kill chain [15]. Machete APT operations are no exception. The fi ve phases of the\noperation are illustrated in Figure 2, namely: delivery, installation, action on objectives, lateral\nmovement and exfi ltration. This section describes these phases, the encryption used to protect the\nstolen information, and fi nally, why we consider Machete to be a cyber espionage tool.\n\n_Figure 2: Machete operations are structured in fi ve phases: delivery, installation, action on_\n_objectives, lateral movement and exfi ltration._\n\n**Delivery**\n\nThere are four known methods for distributing Machete: (i) as a malicious attachment in a phishing\nemail, (ii) as a linked fi le (URL) in a phishing email, (iii) as an executable fi le in an infected USB\n\n\n-----\n\ndrive, and (iv) via web injections. The fi rst two methods are the most likely to be used for the initial\ncompromise according to previous work [3, 4].\n\nThe third method of delivery, discovered during this investigation, is commonly used by attackers in\norder to jump air-gapped secured systems and to move laterally within an already compromised\norganization. No exploits or zero-day vulnerabilities are needed for the delivery of this malware.\n\n**Installation**\n\nTargeted victims are lured into downloading and opening the Machete malware via well-crafted\nsocial engineering techniques. As previously mentioned, no vulnerabilities are exploited in the\noperating system in order to execute the malware. Once the victim clicks to open the decoy fi le, the\nmalware is executed and the decoy document is displayed to the victim.\n\n**Action on objectives**\n\nMachete is an espionage tool designed to steal information such as keystrokes, clipboard content,\nscreenshots, web camera captures, audio from the computer’s microphone, system information and\ngeolocation of the target. These functionalities are described in full in the next section.\n\n**Lateral movement**\n\nCompromised victims can be used to spread the malware further within the same organization.\nThrough reverse engineering of the samples, we discovered that Machete has specifi c instructions on\nhow to spread automatically via USB drives. In the presence of an external drive, Machete will copy\nitself to the drive, then proceed to copy any important documents to the computer in order to steal\nthem. This spreading gives attackers the ability to strengthen their foothold in an organization,\nmaximizing their effectiveness.\n\n**Exfi ltration**\n\nWe use the term ‘exfi ltration’ to refer to the act of ‘unauthorized copying and transmission of\ninformation by any means’, as defi ned in [16]. Machete has three main methods of exfi ltrating the\nstolen information from its victims. First, it uploads the collected data to a designated File Transfer\nProtocol (FTP) server. While the documents are encrypted, the FTP communication is not encrypted.\nThe FTP server is secured with a username and password, however the credentials can be found\neither in the source code of the malware or, in newer versions of the malware, in a confi guration fi le.\n\nThe second method for exfi ltrating the information from the victim is via USB devices. Machete is\nable to recognize special USB devices, and if they are present the malware will copy the collected\ninformation to the USB drive. This latter feature suggests that the attackers may have physical access\nto some of the victim computers.\n\nThe third method for data exfi ltration was observed only in a few cases. In those cases, Machete was\nusing Dropbox [17] as an exfi ltration server.\n\n**Encryption**\n\nMachete encrypts the fi les using symmetric encryption. In particular, it uses the Advanced\nEncryption Standard (AES) algorithm, and the encryption key is embedded in the source code of the\nmalware. (Encryption is further discussed in the ‘malware infrastructure’ subsection.)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Machete cyber espionage capabilities**\n\nMachete shares some capabilities with other APT groups such as remote access tools, and\ninformation-stealing malware. This raises some questions, such as ‘Why is Machete different?’ and\n‘What makes it an espionage tool?’\n\nMachete differentiates itself from other malware thanks to its combined capabilities. The recording\nof audio, capture of web camera photographs and collecting of documents from the victim’s\ncomputer over long periods of time is something that can be directly linked to possible extortion,\nsurveillance or espionage activities.\n\nThe intent and specifi c data-stealing functionality is what defi nes Machete as a cyber espionage tool.\nThe information stolen does not appear to have monetary value for the threat actors. The tool is not\ndesigned to steal credit card information, usernames and passwords – the sort of information that\nanyone can easily profi t from. The information stolen by Machete seems valuable only to actors that\nwould use this information themselves, along with their own information, to infl uence decisions and\ngain strategic advantage at a government or political level.\n\n**MA LWARE CAPABILITIES**\n\nThe purpose of Machete is to steal information about its victims, specifi cally documents or data they\nmay possess and information about their current behaviour. During the analysis of Machete samples\nover a period of eight years we observed the APT group adding and removing functionality.\nConsidering the complete malware corpus, we found functions designed to steal the following\ninformation:\n\n**• System information: who the target is and information about the computer being used.**\n\n**• Geolocation:** where the target is located.\n\n**• Keystrokes: what the target writes.**\n\n**• Clipboard content: what the target copies and pastes.**\n\n**• Screen captures: what the target is seeing on the screen.**\n\n**• Web camera captures: who or what is in front of the computer’s web camera fi eld of view.**\n\n**• Audio: what the victim is saying, or conversations from the surrounding environment.**\n\n**• Documents: specifi c documents in the target’s computer.**\n\nIn the following subsections each function is described in detail.\n\n**System information**\n\nThe type and amount of information collected from the targets varies as well as the method. In early\nversions of Machete, the extraction was fi eld by fi eld using the platform [21] library, which is part of\nthe Python standard library. As illustrated in Figure 3, the information collected consisted of public\nIP, operating system name, operating system release, the computer network name (node), system\nversion, architecture and processor. The public IP is retrieved after contacting the C&C server.\nInformation about local network cards, local IPs and MAC addresses is obtained using the Windows\ncommand ipconfi g. The collected information is stored in a text fi le for later exfi ltration.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Gathering system information using the platform library._\n\nThis Python library was later replaced with the Windows systeminfo function. In later versions of\nMachete the information collected in this step was reduced considerably.\n\n**Geolocation**\n\nThere are fewer than a dozen samples of Machete that incorporate the functionality to geographically\nlocate the target using Wi-Fi MAC addresses. The oldest sample to implement this functionality is\nfrom 2012, and the latest one is from 2019. The malware has two modes of retrieving geo location:\nthe fi rst uses only the MAC address, while the second uses MAC address, channel, and signal\nstrength. In both cases the malware fi rst collects the information from the infected device using the\n_Windows netsh command. There are several attempts at determining the geo location based on the_\ninformation available using a Google API[2]. The information the malware is retrieving is the accuracy,\nlatitude, longitude, and a link to Google Maps.\n\n_Figure 4: Gathering geolocation information._\n\nIt is important to note here that the link to Google Maps is regionalized to Argentina (com.ar). The\nlink is created as follows:\n\nhttp://maps.google.com.ar/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=%s+%s\n\n**Keystrokes**\n\nFor the stealing of keystrokes, the malware has a keylogger functionality in one of its modules. The\nmalware defi nes a series of keys in which it is interested, and defi nes what to do when one of these\nkeys is pressed in the operating system. Machete creates a log fi le formatted as Hyper Text Markup\nLanguage (.htm). The log contains the date and time of the keystrokes, name of the opened\napplication, and the keystrokes typed by the user. In this manner, the attackers not only know what\n\n2 The API used by the malware was deprecated in early 2012, and discontinued by the end of 2012.\n\n\n-----\n\nthe victim was typing, but also when and where. This provides context and an added value to the\nstolen information.\n\nThis module has suffered minor changes since its fi rst development. One change highlight occurred\nin mid-2012 when the names of the key IDs were re-written. In this change a typo was introduced\nthat has been present in all the Machete samples that have come since then. The keys 160 and 161\nwere renamed from lshift and rshift to Shitf(Izq) and Shitf(Dcha).\n\n**Clipboard content**\n\nSimilarly, the malware has a clipboard monitor, which logs everything that the victim copies in a\nspecial log fi le named ‘Clip.html’. The malware logs the clipboard content, data and time, and the\nname of the open window.\n\n**Screen captures**\n\nAnother vital functionality of Machete is screen capture. Machete is able to take screenshots from the\nvictim computer. These images are indexed by date and time, and provide high value to the attackers\nin their intelligence analysis due to their rich and detailed content.\n\n**Web camera captures**\n\nAnother of the functions is web camera capture, in which the malware routinely takes pictures using\nthe web camera of the computer (if such a device exists). The web camera capture can tell the\nattackers who is using the computer, what the victim looks like, or reveal the identity of other\nindividuals. Not only that, it also shows when the computer is unattended, which can be vital if the\nattackers have physical access to the infected machine.\n\n**Audio**\n\nMachete is also able to record sound using the microphone of the computer. This functionality has\nbeen added and removed multiple times. The Python library pyaudio is used to record the audio in\n.WAV fi les. The malware then uses the LAME MP3 audio encoder to convert the fi les to MP3.\n\n**Documents**\n\nThe last core functionality is document stealing. The malware is able to fi nd, encrypt, and steal\ninteresting documents found on the victim computer. Attackers defi ne fi les as interesting based on the\ntype of document. In the oldest sample of Machete from 2011, the malware was looking for a small\ncollection of fi le extensions: .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .jpg, .pgp, .skr and .asc. The interest\nin retrieving new documents increased, and the list expanded to include the additional fi le extensions:\n.db, .mdb, .pkr, .gpg, .drw, .lpt, .shp, .rte, .sda, .odp, .sxi, .odt, .sxw, .ods, .sxc, .odg, .sxd, .odb, .odf,\n.sxm, .txt, and specifi c fi les such as key3.db and signons.sqlite used by Firefox to store user\ncredentials. The fi les are encrypted before they are exfi ltrated.\n\nApart from well-known document formats, is worth noting the attackers’ interest in databases (.db, .\nmdb, .odb), encryption fi les (.gpg, .pgp, .asc, .skr, .pkr), maps and design fi les (.drw, .lpt, .shp, .sda,\n.sxd), and business applications’ source code (.os).\n\n\n-----\n\n**MALW ARE INFRASTRUCTURE**\n\nThe analysis of Machete and its functionality also provided some insights into the attackers’ own\noperational capabilities. With the information obtained from the samples we tried to answer the\nfollowing questions:\n\n - What are the attackers’ capabilities in terms of infrastructure?\n\n - Are there multiple attackers that use Machete?\n\n - How did the malware evolve over time?\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nMachete exfi ltrates information primarily via FTP servers. This information is embedded in the\nMachete samples, namely: domain name, username and password, routes, version, and encryption\nkey. Table 1 provides a summary of the above information along with the software versions found in\nthe malware. Passwords are not displayed for security reasons. Figure 5 shows the distribution of the\nFTP users, routes and malware versions among the malware samples analysed.\n\n**List of servers** **FTP user** **FTP routes** **Malware versions**\n\nCancer\n\nAND\n\nArkantos\n\nEquipos\n\nadministrador GANADEROS_4\n\n190.60.245.28 andryu SII  \nAND\n\nSII\n\nSII/AGM\n\nMARQUETALIA\n\nGANADEROS_2\n\nGANADEROS_4\n\nGANADEROS_6\n\nset\n\nSET\n\nand\n\nArkantos\n\n190.60.245.29 administrador Equipos  \nftp.agaliarept.com Manizales huanuco  \nftp.alquimedes.net admin1 Buenaventura 13.1\n\nftp.blogwhereyou.com administrador bitec  \nftp.Grannegral.com grannadmin  -  \n_Table 1: Attacker infrastructure summary._\n\n|List of servers|FTP user|FTP routes|Malware versions|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|190.60.245.28|administrador andryu|Cancer AND Arkantos Equipos GANADEROS_4 SII|-|\n|190.60.245.29|administrador|AND SII SII/AGM MARQUETALIA GANADEROS_2 GANADEROS_4 GANADEROS_6 set SET and Arkantos Equipos|-|\n|ftp.agaliarept.com|Manizales|huanuco|-|\n|ftp.alquimedes.net|admin1|Buenaventura|13.1|\n|ftp.blogwhereyou.com|administrador|bitec|-|\n|ftp.Grannegral.com|grannadmin|-|-|\n\n\n-----\n\n|List of servers|FTP user|FTP routes|Malware versions|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|derte.ddns.net|ahy860|Amazona Apoyos EL FRA1 HUM11 Otros Pro SIS TE TRANS|2.0 2.2 39.0|\n|skdier.ddns.net|bafer|Otros|75.0|\n|idrt.gotdns.ch|ad856|Amazona Buenaventura Cali Guajira Huila Monteria Vichada|2.2 3.0 21.3 27.1 27.9|\n|mcsi.gotdns.ch|mager|-|-|\n|jristr.hopto.org|ad856|Huila|20.1|\n|maers.hopto.org|mkier|Armenia Buenaventura Cali Casanare Guajira Risaralda Vichada|4.0 84.0|\n|java-mail.servepics.com|administrador|bitec|-|\n|java.dyndns-mail.com|administrador|Marquetalia Rimex|-|\n|java.serveblog.net|admin1|-|14.0 14.2|\n|javath.myftp.org|administrador|Marquetalia|-|\n|wbgs.3utilities.com|custom97|Risaralda|4.0|\n|Grannegral.com3|-|-|-|\n|agaliarept.com3|-|-|-|\n|blogwhereyou.com3|-|-|-|\n\n\n_Table 1: Attacker infrastructure summary (contd.)._\n\n3 These sites are used as HTTP C&C servers, therefore no credentials are associated with them.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Distributon of (a) FTP servers; (b) FTP users; (c) malware versions;_\n_and (d) FTP routes._\n\n**• FTP servers. Machete used multiple FTP server domains for its campaigns. For the most part**\nthe domain names do not overlap with the malware versions. A total of 14 FTP server domains\nwere identifi ed. Machete used dynamic DNS services such as ddns.net or serveblog.net in many\ncases. Dynamic DNS gives fl exibility to their operations.\n\n**• FTP credentials. From 2013, the group used one set of usernames per FTP server. However, in**\nolder samples the attackers were using the same username across multiple FTP servers. The\nsame password was reused in multiple accounts. Attackers evolved to use multiple versions as a\nway to separate functionality and/or targets.\n\n**• FTP routes. The most used FTP servers contain several routes. These are folders in the FTP**\nserver where the stolen information is stored. Every Machete sample has a route defi ned. Routes\nare often named after Colombian cities or areas, e.g. Buenaventura, Guajira, Huila, etc. This\nmight be an indication of where the attack operators are stationed.\n\n\n-----\n\n**• IP addresses. A total of 13 unique IP addresses have been found associated with Machete FTP**\nservers since its origin. These IPs were obtained via a public passive DNS service [18]. Passive\nDNS is a system that stores DNS resolution data along with time period. Further analysis showed\nthat different domain names shared IP addresses, even during overlapping periods of time.\n\nThe earliest date that an FTP domain was seen is early 2012. Before this time, attackers relied on\nIP addresses.\n\n**• Encryption keys. Machete uses symmetric encryption to encrypt the stolen data before**\nexfi ltrating it. The encryption key is embedded in the binary. Three distinct AES keys were\nshared among all analysed samples. This is a strong indication that there was only one group\ninvolved in the malware operation as it is very unlikely that different organizations would choose\nto encrypt their documents with the same keys and store them on the same servers.\n\n**M ALWARE EVOLUTION**\n\nThe oldest Machete binary in our corpus dates back to 2011. This is confi rmed by the sample’s\nsubmission date to VirusTotal [20], which was also in the same year. The most recent sample of\nMachete was observed in early 2019. Through our reverse engineering and code analysis we have\nbeen able to identify three major changes in the last eight years of Machete activity. The fi rst major\nchange was to split Machete functionality into different smaller modules – this happened in early\n2011, bringing more fl exibility to the malware. The second major change was in 2014 when the\nobfuscation of the Python source code was added in an effort to bypass detection. The third major\nchange was in early 2019 when the unpacking of the malware code changed considerably, also to\nhinder detection efforts.\n\nMachete’s authors used multiple versions of the malware mainly to differentiate between campaigns\nand targets. Modules and functionality were added or removed over time. However, the underlying\ncode structure did not change dramatically until late 2018.\n\nThe initial versions of the malware showed how its authors were putting together the malware,\nbuilding up new functionality, testing libraries, fi ne tuning parameters. Modularity was added later.\nIn early samples the malware had hard-coded IPs and credentials for the FTP server to exfi ltrate data.\nThe IPs were later changed to dynamic DNS domain names, but were still in plain text in the code.\nThe malware later evolved to obfuscate the credentials, and later stored them in a text fi le,\nobfuscated. All the changes observed gave Machete modularity and fl exibility, allowing new\ncampaigns to be created with the minimum modifi cation of the code.\n\nIn terms of anti-analysis techniques, the vast majority of the samples were obfuscated at the Python\nsource code level, probably as an attempt to slow down malware analysts. Earlier versions of\nMachete were not obfuscated at all.\n\n**A NALYSIS OF TARGETS**\n\nTo understand the purpose of Machete, and the goals of the actors operating it, we analysed the\ntargeted victims. The analysis of possible victims is performed through the analysis of the decoy\ndocuments used. Decoy documents were obtained from Machete parent samples, which contained\nboth decoy and malware. By looking at the decoys used in the campaigns through the years we try to\ninfer the profi les of the targets. Information about victims obtained from previous work [3, 4] was\nnot taken into account as it was impossible to validate it.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Manual annotation of decoy documents**\n\nA total of 75 unique decoy documents were identifi ed, each of which was used in one or more\nmalicious campaigns. The decoy documents were embedded and compressed in the Machete\nmalware – however, they were only used as decoys and not as an exploitation tool. In this section we\npresent an analysis of 40 documents observed between 2013 and 2018.\n\nWe manually analysed each decoy document used by Machete, noting the language, country, dates,\nand theme covered. The fi rst phase consisted of noting the type of document used (PDF, Word,\nimages, etc.). The second phase consisted of identifying the language used in the documents, to\nestablish a target group. The third phase focused on assigning each document to a theme category\nbased on the content (political, economic, military, etc.). The fourth phase consisted of identifying\nthe country or countries targeted by the document.\n\n**_Type of decoy documents_**\n\nThe type of documents used were predominantly Microsoft Word documents, followed by PDF,\n_PowerPoint documents, and JPG images (see Figure 6). Two versions of Microsoft documents were_\nused: .docx and .doc. The .docx format was introduced in Word 2007. PDF documents were the\nsecond most commonly used type of document. In third place, different Microsoft PowerPoint\ndocuments were used: .pps, .ppt and .pptx. Lastly, one image in JPG format was used.\n\n_Figure 6: Breakdown of decoy documents used by Machete._\n\nThe majority of the documents appear to be documents that have been stolen and re-purposed for the\nspear-phishing attacks. They could have been manually crafted for the purpose of the attacks, but\nthere are indicators which point to our fi rst hypothesis. In particular, many of the Microsoft Word\ndocuments still contained metadata about date of creation, author, organization, and last time printed,\nwhich appeared to be real. Typically, a manually crafted document will have this data removed or\nreplaced with fake data. This doesn’t seem to be the case in the corpus of documents we analysed. A\nsubgroup of documents contained information, names, stamps and references that would also be hard\nto fake.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Languages, countries, regions_**\n\nSpanish speakers are the primary targets of Machete, but not the only ones as previous work\nsuggested [4]. Of all the decoy documents analysed, one document was written in Portuguese and the\nrest were written in Spanish. All Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries could be targeted by\nthese decoys, irrespective of the country or region. Spanish is the offi cial language in 21 countries,\nthe majority of which are located in Central and South America [19].\n\nAfter careful analysis of the content of the documents, it was possible to observe that each one\nmade specifi c reference to certain countries. It was possible then, again through careful analysis,\nto identify the affected countries in each document. The content of each document was read and\nexamined by native Spanish speakers in order to identify the theme and the country. For instance,\nin a military personnel reassignment decoy document, all personnel mentioned were from\nVenezuela. In this case, the annotated country was Venezuela. This process was repeated for all\ndecoy documents that contained enough context. The annotated country is just an indication of\nwhere the document was stolen or crafted from, but it doesn’t limit the target audience, as any\nmilitary offi cial from neighbouring countries would also be interested in this information.\n\nIn Figure 7 we show the number of decoy documents per country, while in Figure 8 we emphasize\nthe geographical regions from which the documents were stolen. While previous work mentioned\ntargeted victims outside Latin America, we could not confi rm that by looking at the data obtained\nfrom the Machete samples.\n\n_Figure 7: Number of decoys per country used by Machete._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: The content of the decoy documents show countries targeted by Machete._\n\n**Topics**\n\nThe themes of the decoy documents indicate that the potential victims are heavily interested in\npolitical topics at national levels, and in military information, ranging from the movement of troops\nto personnel reassignments. Other decoys appealed to the sense of fear in the victim, using themes\nsuch as debt collection and legal subpoenas. In a minority of cases the attackers used generic themes\nsuch as sexual content to lure victims into opening the documents; in this case the targets were\nprimarily male. Each document focuses on a specifi c theme or topic that is highly alluring and\nattractive for the targets. The number of documents per topic used by Machete is shown in Figure 9.\n\n_Figure 9: Breakdown of topics used by Machete in decoy documents._\n\n\n-----\n\nDecoy documents used in targeted attacks must have certain characteristics. According to the work of\n\n[10], attackers use documents that are (1) believable, (2) enticing and (3) conspicuous. The decoy\ndocuments used in this espionage activity are believable, due to their nature: they are real, existing\ndocuments, not crafted or artifi cially created. The documents are enticing, as the topics covered are\nhighly attractive and lure victims into opening them. Finally, they are conspicuous as they attract\nattention and are easily observable by the victim.\n\n**Dates**\n\nThe creation date was extracted from the metadata of each document. Metadata can be altered, so\nthis date is taken as an initial reference of document creation. These dates show that the documents\nwere created in the years 2000, 2006, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.\n\n**CONCL USIONS**\n\nThis paper has presented an analysis of eight years of operations of an APT group targeting Latin\nAmerica using a cyber espionage tool known as Machete. Spear phishing through the use of real and\nenticing documents seems the most effective way to compromise their targets. The functionality of\nMachete has fl uctuated considerably in the last eight years, however the main core functionality of\nthe malware remains: keylogging, screen capture, and document stealing. The oldest Machete sample\nwas observed in early 2011, which suggests that the group’s activities started earlier. Machete is still\nactive today.\n\nOur analysis of decoy documents showed that the targeted victims are mainly located in Latin\nAmerica. However, in this work we could not arrive at the same conclusions as were drawn in\nprevious work regarding the number of victims and their countries. Additionally, the majority of the\ndecoy documents are written in Spanish, but there is a minority of documents in Portuguese,\nconfi rming that the victims are located all across Latin America. The documents’ topics are mostly\nmilitary and political in nature, which points to military and politically motivated targets.\n\nOur investigation suggests that APT sophistication is directly related to the socioeconomics of the\ntargeted regions. Machete is sophisticated considering the region in which it operates. Compared to\nother APTs it does lack sophistication in terms of the programming language used, the lack of\nvulnerabilities exploited, and its anti-analysis techniques. However, failing to investigate threats like\nthis based on their apparent lack of sophistication leaves victims in the dark and unprotected.\n\nOur research has also shown that Machete does not rely on zero-day exploits. This confi rms previous\nresearch that also shows that APT groups rely more on spear-phishing techniques.\n\nMachete continues to evolve and new malware samples are being observed every month. As part of\nour future work we plan to continue monitoring it and reporting on its activities in order to help stop\nthis threat.\n\n**ACKNO WLEDGEMENT**\n\nThe authors would like to thank Ross Gibb for his assistance with malware reversing; Reversing Labs\nfor access to their malware repository; and Luciano Martins for providing additional Machete\nsamples. This research was partially supported by an Avast Foundation grant for the protection of\ncivil society.\n\n\n-----\n\n**REFER ENCES**\n\n[1] Espionage. https://www.mi5.gov.uk/espionage.\n\n[2] Chen, P.; Desmet, L.; Huygens, C.
