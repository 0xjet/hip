    "plain_text": "# New web skimmer steals credit card data, sends to crooks via Telegram\n\n**[blog.malwarebytes.com/web-threats/2020/09/web-skimmer-steals-credit-card-data-via-telegram/](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/web-threats/2020/09/web-skimmer-steals-credit-card-data-via-telegram/)**\n\nJérôme Segura September 1, 2020\n\nThe digital credit card skimming landscape keeps evolving, often borrowing techniques used\nby other malware authors in order to avoid detection.\n\nAs defenders, we look for any kind of artifacts and malicious infrastructure that we might be\nable to identify to protect our users and alert affected merchants. These malicious artifacts\ncan range from compromised stores to malicious JavaScript, domains, and IP addresses\nused to host a skimmer and exfiltrate data.\n\nOne such artifact is a so-called “gate,” which is typically a domain or IP address where stolen\ncustomer data is being sent and collected by cybercriminals. Typically, we see threat actors\neither stand up their own gate infrastructure or use compromised resources.\n\nHowever, there are variations that involve abusing legitimate programs and services, thereby\nblending in with normal traffic. In this blog, we take a look at the latest web skimming trick,\nwhich consists of sending stolen credit card data via the popular instant messaging platform\nTelegram.\n\n## An otherwise normal shopping experience\n\n\n-----\n\nWe are seeing a large number of e-commerce sites attacked either through a common\nvulnerability or stolen credentials. Unaware shoppers may visit a merchant that has been\ncompromised with a web skimmer and make a purchase while unknowingly handing over\ntheir credit card data to criminals.\n\nSkimmers insert themselves seamlessly within the shopping experience and only those with\na keen eye for detail or who are armed with the proper network tools may notice something’s\nnot right.\n\nFigure 1: Credit card skimmer using Telegram bot\nThe skimmer will become active on the payment page and surreptitiously exfiltrate the\npersonal and banking information entered by the customer. In simple terms, things like\nname, address, credit card number, expiry, and CVV will be leaked via an instant message\nsent to a private Telegram channel.\n\n## Telegram-based skimmer\n\nTelegram is a popular and legitimate instant messaging service that provides end-to-end\nencryption. A number of cybercriminals abuse it for their daily communications but also for\nautomated tasks found in malware.\n\nAttackers have used Telegram to exfiltrate data before, for example via traditional Trojan\n[horses, such as the Masad stealer. However, security researcher](https://blogs.juniper.net/en-us/threat-research/masad-stealer-exfiltrating-using-telegram) [@AffableKraut shared the](https://twitter.com/AffableKraut/)\nfirst publicly documented instance of a credit card skimmer used in Telegram in a Twitter\nthread.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe skimmer code keeps with tradition in that it checks for the usual web debuggers to\nprevent being analyzed. It also looks for fields of interest, such as billing, payment, credit\ncard number, expiration, and CVV.\n\nFigure 2: First part of the skimmer code\nThe novelty is the presence of the Telegram code to exfiltrate the stolen data. The skimmer’s\nauthor encoded the bot ID and channel, as well as the Telegram API request with simple\nBase64 encoding to keep it away from prying eyes.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Skimming code containing Telegram’s API\nThe exfiltration is triggered only if the browser’s current URL contains a keyword indicative of\na shopping site and when the user validates the purchase. At this point, the browser will\nsend the payment details to both the legitimate payment processor and the cybercriminals.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n4: A purchase where credit card data is stolen and exfiltrated\nThe fraudulent data exchange is conducted via Telegram’s API, which posts payment details\ninto a chat channel. That data was previously encrypted to make identification more difficult.\n\nFor threat actors, this data exfiltration mechanism is efficient and doesn’t require them to\nkeep up infrastructure that could be taken down or blocked by defenders. They can even\nreceive a notification in real time for each new victim, helping them quickly monetize the\nstolen cards in underground markets.\n\n## Challenges with network protection\n\nDefending against this variant of a skimming attack is a little more tricky since it relies on a\nlegitimate communication service. One could obviously block all connections to Telegram at\nthe network level, but attackers could easily switch to another provider or platform (as they\n[have done before) and still get away with it.](https://sansec.io/research/skimming-google-defeats-csp)\n\n[Malwarebytes Browser Guard will identify and block this specific skimming attack without](https://www.malwarebytes.com/browserguard/)\ndisabling or interfering with the use of Telegram or its API. So far we have only identified a\ncouple of online stores that have been compromised with this variant, but there are likely\nseveral more.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n5: Malwarebytes blocking this skimming attack\nAs always, we need to adapt our tools and methodologies to keep up with financiallymotivated attacks targeting e-commerce platforms. Online merchants also play a huge role in\nderailing this criminal enterprise and preserving the trust of their customer base. By being\nproactive and vigilant, security researchers and e-commerce vendors can work together to\ndefeat cybercriminals standing in the way of legitimate business.\n\n\n-----",
