But the story doesn’t stop with that\nrevelation; analysts working with this blog have continued to investigate every lead provided\nto us. One such lead has helped us to identify another individual in China connected to\n[APT10. The trail starts with a domain name first published in FireEye’s Poison Ivy Report as](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-poison-ivy.pdf)\na MenuPass (APT10) affiliated domain.\n\n**chromeenter[.]com**\n\nThe domain chromeenter[.]com appears in the FireEye report as a domain associated with\nthe MenuPass malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFireEye PoisonIvy Report showing chromeenter[.]com as a MenuPass domainThe domain\nand subdomains also appeared in early versions of Annex A (Indicators of Compromise) of\nthe [PwC Operation Cloud Hopper report and it is listed on Alien Vault as a sink-holed](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-data-privacy/insights/operation-cloud-hopper.html)\ndomain.\n\nchromeenter[.]com in Version 1 of the PwC Operation Cloud Hopper reportTianjin Tiaoyiye\n**Technology Co** **Ltd**\nDomain registration information for chromeenter[.]com shows that it was registered in April\n2010 to Hogate Technology Co Limited. Although much of the registration information\nremained the same when the domain was updated in April 2012, the registrant company was\nchanged to Tianjin Tiaoyiye Technology Co Limited and the registration e-mail address was\nupdated to gbaike[at]gmail.com. The domain became WHOIS protected in late June 2013\njust prior to being repossessed by GoDaddy and named in the FireEye report.\n\n**gbaike[at]gmail.com**\n\nThe registration e-mail address used from 2012 leads to a number of other domains, many of\nwhich are connected to Tianjin, China, the home of APT10. Domains registered by\ngbaike[at]gmail.com include:\n\njiaxiaotuangou[.]com\nshgongxingbc[.]com\ntjguge[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\ntjqiming[.]com\ntjttjx[.]com\nweb1680[.]com\nw1680[.]com\n\nThe domain jiaxiaotuangou[.]com was registered to an individual named An Zhiqiang and\nwas also associated with the Tianjin Tiaoyiye Technology Development Co Ltd (天津天骄易业\n科技发展有限公司) in registration data. Chinese characters for the company were identified\nat [hhlyny.com and give a slightly different name of Tianjin Tianjiaoyiye Technology](http://www.hhlyny.com/1188136/www..jiaxiaotuangou..com)\nDevelopment Co Ltd.\n\nRegistration information for jiaxiaotuangou[.]com showing the company nameThe company\nentry on Zhaopin (a Chinese online recruitment services website) provides additional data\nrelated to the company including a link to the company website at tjwangdian[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\nZhaopin entry for 天津天骄易业科技发展有限公司 showing company domain name\nThe Zhaopin entry also provides a summary of the business activities of the company that\ntranslates roughly as:\n\nTianjiao Network is an e-commerce website construction company with rich\nexperience, professional technology and excellent team. The company focuses on ecommerce website development and network operations, including: e-commerce\nwebsite construction, B2C website construction, independent online shop construction,\nmall website construction, industry website construction, portal construction, brand\nwebsite construction and post-maintenance. From pre-market research, website\npositioning, website construction and implementation, network promotion, website\noperation, and even later online customer service and customer relationship\nmanagement, we have experienced planning team, professional website design team\nand dedicated customers. The service team consistently adheres to the spirit of “no\nbest, only better!” to create a real profit platform for the company, strengthen the\ncompetitiveness of the company, and obtain greater success value!\n\nFinally the [entry for Tianjin Tiaoyiye on Liepin (China’s largest recruitment website) provides](https://www.liepin.com/company/gs9156378/)\nChinese characters for An Zhiqiang (安志强).\n\n\n-----\n\nLiepin entry for 天津天骄易业科技发展有限公司 showing 安志强’s name\n**@gbaike**\n\nArmed with a name (安志强), a handle (gbaike), a location (Tianjin) and a company (天津天\n骄易业科技发展有限公司) a number of new sources of material on the individual can be\ndiscovered, including Twitter account [@gbaike. The account is in the name 安志强, bears the](https://twitter.com/gbaike)\nhandle @gbaike and has its location set as Tianjin. The account also refers to marketing in\nits profile image – this matches the description of the company from Zhaopin.\n\n@gbaike’s Twitter account\n\n\n-----\n\n**web1680[.]com and tjmeta[.]com**\n\nAn Zhiqiang, WeChat lecturer\nThe final link to a specific individual in Tianjin\ncomes from the domain web1680[.]com which\nwas identified above as registered by\ngbaike[at]gmail.com. The website’s contact us\npage contains the phone number 15102292183.\n\nThis same phone number is listed on a different\nwebsite, tjmeta[.]com that lists An Zhiqiang (安\n志强) as an instructor in internet marketing with\na specialism in WeChat marketing.\n\nThe bullet points on the right hand side of the\nscreenshot from tjmeta[.]com match those used\nin @gbaike’s Twitter cover image above.\n\nThe photo appears to be that of a well known web marketing expert from Tianjin, China.\n\n**In summary, An Zhiqiang (安志强) and company Tianjin Tianjiaoyiye Technology Co**\n**Ltd (天津天骄易业科技发展有限公司) are both connected to APT10 activity through**\n**domains used for APT10 / MenuPass activity prior to FireEye’s 2013 Poison Ivy report.**\n\n\n-----",
