In the Linux variant, the\ngenerated RC4 key is encrypted with a RC4 [hardcoded] ‘master-key’,” the researchers\nexplained.\n\n## The differences between Windows and Linux variants\n\nThe Linux Cl0p variant is relatively new, and was first spotted by the researchers in late\nDecember 2022.\n\n“It appears to be in its initial development phases as some functionalities present in the\n[Windows versions do not currently exist in this new Linux version,” they noted.](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/cl0p-ransomware-targets-linux-systems-with-flawed-encryption-decryptor-available/)\n\n“A reason for this could be that the threat actor has not needed to dedicate time and\nresources to improve obfuscation or evasiveness due to the fact that it is currently\n[undetected by all 64 security engines on VirusTotal.”](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/tag/virustotal/)\n\nThe differences between the Windows and Linux variant are many. For example, the former\navoids encrypting specific folders, files and files with specific extenstions, and the latter does\nnot. The former can be executed with different parameters to guide which drives will be\ntargeted for encryption, while the latter is focused on encrypting just the specified hardcoded\nfolders. The former carries an encrypted ransom note that gets encrypted, but the former\nstores the note as plain text\n\n\n-----\n\nBut the most consequential difference – from the victims perspective, that is – is the flaw that\nmade possible the creation of the decryptor.\n\n“Over the last twelve months or so we have continued to observe the increased targeting of\nmultiple platforms by individual ransomware operators or variants,” the researchers noted.\n\n“While the Linux-flavored variation of Cl0p is, at this time, in its infancy, its development and\nthe almost ubiquitous use of Linux in servers and cloud workloads suggests that defenders\nshould expect to see more Linux-targeted ransomware campaigns going forward.”\n\nIt is to be expected that Cl0p ransomware developers will fix the vulnerability soon. In the\nmeantime, victims can use the decryption tool and look into better protecting their systems\nagainst ransomware attacks in general.\n\n\n-----",
