While multiple attacks were conducted\nby multiple perpetrators, one of the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks observed\nyesterday against South Korean government websites can be directly linked to the\nDarkSeoul gang and Trojan.Castov.\n\nWe can now attribute multiple previous high-profile attacks to the DarkSeoul gang over the\nlast 4 years against South Korea, in addition to yesterday’s attack. These attacks include the\n[devastating Jokra attacks in March 2013 that wiped numerous computer hard drives at South](https://web.archive.org/web/20130701021735/http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/south-korean-banks-and-broadcasting-organizations-suffer-major-damage-cyberattack)\nKorean banks and television broadcasters, as well as the attacks on South Korean financial\ncompanies in May 2013.\n\nConducting DDoS attacks and hard disk wiping on key historical dates is not new for the\n[DarkSeoul gang. They previously conducted DDoS and wiping attacks on the United States](https://web.archive.org/web/20130701021735/http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2009-070814-5311-99)\nIndependence Day as well.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1. Four years of DarkSeoul activity_**\n\nThe DarkSeoul gang’s attacks tend to follow similar methods of operation. Trademarks of\ntheir attacks include:\n\nMulti-staged, coordinated attacks against high-profile targets in South Korea\nDestructive payloads, such as hard disk wiping and DDoS attacks configured to trigger\non historically significant dates\nOverwriting disk sectors with politically-themed strings\nUse of legitimate third-party patching mechanisms in order to spread across corporate\nnetworks\nSpecific encryption and obfuscation methods\nUse of specific third-party webmailer servers to store files\nUse of similar command-and-control structures\n\nThe attacks conducted by the DarkSeoul gang have required intelligence and coordination,\nand in some cases have demonstrated technical sophistication. While nation-state attribution\nis difficult, South Korean [media reports have pointed to an investigation which concluded the](https://web.archive.org/web/20130701021735/http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/04/11/2013041100648.html)\nattackers were working on behalf of North Korea. Symantec expects the DarkSeoul attacks\nto continue and, regardless of whether the gang is working on behalf of North Korea or not,\nthe attacks are both politically motivated and have the necessary financial support to\ncontinue acts of cybersabotage on organizations in South Korea. Cybersabotage attacks on\n[a national scale have been rare—Stuxnet and Shamoon (W32.Disttrack) are the other two](https://web.archive.org/web/20130701021735/http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-071400-3123-99)\n\n\n-----\n\nmain examples. However, the DarkSeoul gang is almost unique in its ability to carry out such\nhigh-profile and damaging attacks over several years.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2. Castov DDoS attack_**\n\nThe Castov DDoS attack occurs in the following manner:\n\n[1. Compromised website leads to the download of SimDisk.exe (Trojan.Castov), a](https://web.archive.org/web/20130701021735/http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-062618-2656-99)\n\nTrojanized version of a legitimate application.\n2. SimDisk.exe drops two files onto the compromised system: SimDisk.exe (Clean), the\n\n[legitimate non-Trojanized version, and SimDiskup.exe (Downloader.Castov).](https://web.archive.org/web/20130701021735/http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-052411-0628-99)\n3. Downloader.Castov connects to a second compromised server to download the C.jpg\n\nfile (Downloader.Castov), an executable file which appears to be an image.\n4. Threat uses the [Tor network to download Sermgr.exe (Trojan.Castov).](https://web.archive.org/web/20130701021735/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29)\n5. Castov drops the Ole[VARIABLE].dll file (Trojan.Castov) in the Windows system folder.\n6. Castov downloads the CT.jpg file from a Web server hosting a ICEWARP webmail, that\n\nhas been compromised as a result of publicly known vulnerabilities in ICEWARP. The\nCT.jpg file contains a timestamp used by Castov to synchronize attacks.\n[7. Once this time is reached, Castov drops Wuauieop.exe (Trojan.Castdos).](https://web.archive.org/web/20130701021735/http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-062621-4929-99)\n8. Castdos begins to overload the Gcc.go.kr DNS server with DNS requests, effectively\n\nperforming a DDoS attack affecting multiple websites.\n\nBlog Entry Filed Under:\n\n\n-----",
