The bank’s clients were making\nwithdrawals from ATMs belonging to other banks and were able to cash out huge sums of\nmoney while their balances remained untouched. The victim bank didn’t realize this until it\ntried to recoup the money withdrawn from the other banks’ ATMs.\n\nDuring our incident response, we discovered the solution to this puzzle: Metel, a modular\nmalware program also known as Corkow.\n\nThe malware, used exclusively by the Metel group, infected the bank’s corporate network via\ne-mail and moved laterally to gain access to the computers within the bank’s IT systems.\n\nHaving gained access to the bank operator’s money-processing system, the gang pulled off\na clever trick by automating the rollback of ATM transactions. This meant that money could\nbe stolen from ATM machines via debit cards while the balance on the cards remained the\nsame, allowing for multiple transactions at different ATM machines.\n\n_Encrypted configuration for Metel malware plugins_\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nOur investigations revealed that the attackers drove around several cities in Russia, stealing\nmoney from ATMs belonging to different banks. With the automated rollback in place the\nmoney was instantly returned to the account after the cash had been dispensed from the\nATM. The group worked exclusively at night, emptying ATM cassettes at several locations.\n\nGCMAN group planted cron script into #bank server, stealing $200/min #bankingAPT\n#TheSAS2016\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fapt-style-bank-robberies-increase-with-metel-gcman-and-carbanak-2-0-attacks%2F73638%2F&text=GCMAN+group+planted+cron+script+into+%23bank+server%2C+stealing+%24200%2Fmin+%23bankingAPT+%23TheSAS2016)\n\nIn all, we discovered Metel in more than 30 financial institutions, but Kaspersky Lab’s\nincident responders were able to clean the networks before any major damage could be\ndone. It is highly likely that this threat is far more widespread and we urge financial\ninstitutions around the world to scan their networks for signs of the Metel malware.\n\nThe Metel criminal group is still active. At the moment, we don’t have any information about\nany victims outside Russia.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## GCMAN – penetration testing tools gone bad\n\nA second group, which we call GCMAN because the malware is based on code compiled on\nthe GCC compiler, emerged recently using similar techniques to the Metel Group to infect\nbanking institutions and attempt to transfer money to e-currency services.\n\nThe initial infection mechanism is handled by spear-phishing financial institution targets with\ne-mails carrying a malicious RAR archive to. Upon opening the RAR archive, an executable\nis started instead of a Microsoft Word document, resulting in infection.\n\nOnce inside the network, the GCMAN group uses legitimate and penetration testing tools\nsuch as Putty, VNC, and Meterpreter for lateral movement. Our investigation revealed an\nattack where the group then planted a cron script into bank’s server, sending financial\ntransactions at the rate of $200 per minute. A time-based scheduler was invoking the script\nevery minute to post new transactions directly to upstream payment processing system. This\nallowed the group to transfer money to multiple e-currency services without these\ntransactions being reported to any system inside the bank.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Decompiled code of GCMAN malware that is responsible for connecting to CnC_\n\nIn a stroke of luck, the financial institutions discovered the suspicious activity on their\nnetwork in time to neutralize the threat and cancel the transactions.\n\nOne interesting observation is that the real attack happened approximately 18 months before\nit was discovered. The group used an MS SQL injection in commercial software running on\none of bank’s public web services, and about a year and a half later, they came back to cash\nout. During that time they poked 70 internal hosts, compromised 56 accounts, making their\nway from 139 attack sources (TOR and compromised home routers).\n\nWe discovered that about two months before the incident someone was trying different\npasswords for an admin account on a banking server. They were really persistent but doing it\nonly three times a week and then only on Saturdays, in an effort to stay under the radar.\n\nKaspersky Lab’s research team responded to three financial institutions in Russia that were\ninfected with the GCMAN malware. It is likely that this threat is far more widespread and we\nurge banks to sweep their networks for signs of this cyber-criminal group.\n\n## Carbanak 2.0: new targets beyond banks\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter [our exposure of the Carbanak group exactly a year ago, the group disappeared for](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/world/bank-hackers-steal-millions-via-malware.html)\nabout five months, leading us to believe that the operation was disbanded. However, in\nSeptember last year, our friends at [CSIS published a blog detailing a new Carbanak variant](https://threatpost.com/new-versions-of-carbanak-banking-malware-seen-hitting-targets-in-u-s-and-europe/114522/)\naffecting one of its customers.\n\nIn December 2015, we confirmed that the group was still active. Kaspersky Lab discovered\nsigns of Carbanak in two institutions – a telecommunications company and a financial\ninstitution.\n\n_Executable files founded in SHIM during Carbanak incident response_\n\nOne interesting characteristic of Carbanak 2.0 is a different victim profile. The group has\nmoved beyond banks and is now targeting the budgeting and accounting departments in any\norganization of interest to them, using the same APT-style tools and techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn one remarkable case, the Carbanak 2.0 gang used its access to a financial institution that\nstores information about shareholders to change the ownership details of a large company.\nThe information was modified to name a money mule as a shareholder of the company,\ndisplaying their IDs. It’s unclear how they wanted to make use of this information in future.\n\n#Carbanak gang is now targeting budgeting & accounting departments #bankingAPT\n#TheSAS2016\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fapt-style-bank-robberies-increase-with-metel-gcman-and-carbanak-2-0-attacks%2F73638%2F&text=%23Carbanak+gang+is+now+targeting+budgeting+%26amp%3B+accounting+departments+%23bankingAPT+%23TheSAS2016)\n\nKaspersky Lab products successfully detect and block the malware used by the Carbanak\n2.0, Metel and GCMAN threat actors with the following detection names:\n\nTrojan-Dropper.Win32.Metel\nBackdoor.Win32.Metel\nTrojan-Banker.Win32.Metel\nBackdoor.Win32.GCMan\nBackdoor.Win64.GCMan\nTrojan-Downloader.Win32.GCMan\nTrojan-Downloader.Win32.Carbanak\nBackdoor.Win32.Carbanak\n\n\n-----\n\n_Kaspersky Lab urges all organizations to carefully scan their networks for the presence of_\n_Carbanak, Metel and GCMAN and, if detected, to disinfect their systems/computers/networks_\n_and report the intrusion to law enforcement._\n\n_All this information has been made available to customers of our APT intelligence reporting_\n_service and they received the indicators of compromise and context information as soon as_\n_they became available._\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOC) are available here:**\n[Metel](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07195100/Metel.ioc)\n[GCMAN](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07195101/Gcman-AttackAgainstFinancialInstitutions.ioc)\n[Carbanak 2.0](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07195101/Carbanak_updatesJan2016.ioc)\n\n**For more about the measures to be taken against these Bank Busters and similar**\n**offensives, read** **[this article in the Kaspersky Business Blog.](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/bank-busting-carbanak-2/15127/)**\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[ATM attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/atm-attacks/)\n[Cybercrime](https://securelist.com/tag/cybercrime/)\n[TheSAS2016](https://securelist.com/tag/thesas2016/)\n[Trojan Banker](https://securelist.com/tag/trojan-banker/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\n[Computer Incidents Investigation Department](https://securelist.com/author/ciid/)\n\nAPT-style bank robberies increase with Metel, GCMAN and Carbanak 2.0 attacks\n\nYour email address will not be published.
