    "plain_text": "# RedEcho group parks domains after public exposure\n\n**[therecord.media/redecho-group-parks-domains-after-public-exposure/](https://therecord.media/redecho-group-parks-domains-after-public-exposure/)**\n\nMarch 29, 2021\n\nA Chinese hacking group linked to a campaign that targeted India’s power grid and critical\ninfrastructure entities has taken down its attack infrastructure after having its operations\nexposed at the end of February 2021.\n\nKnown as RedEcho, the group is one of many Chinese government-sponsored cyberespionage entities active today.\n\nThe earliest signs of RedEcho attacks date back to early 2020, but operations gained a\nsignificant momentum after a May 2020 border dispute between Indian and Chinese troops\nthat devolved into violence and heightened political tensions between the two neighboring\ncountries.\n\nSubsequent RedEcho attacks shifted to target India’s power sector primarily, and the group\nis believed to have breached at least a dozen of Indian power sector organizations, including\nfour of India’s five Regional Load Despatch Centres (RLDCs) and two State Load Despatch\nCentres (SLDCs), where it deployed backdoor malware such as PlugX and ShadowPad,\nallowing the group easy access at any further date.\n\nThese attacks came to light in February 2021, when Recorded Future’s Insikt Group\n[published a report detailing RedEcho’s Indian operations after analysts managed to find](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redecho-targeting-indian-power-sector/)\nunique characteristics in the communications between the malware and its backend\ninfrastructure, allowing them to track attacks by using a combination of proactive\ninfrastructure detections, domain, and network traffic analysis.\n\n## Last activity spotted on March 11, 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nBut less than two weeks after Recorded Future published its findings, the Insikt Group\ntold The Record that RedEcho has now taken down part of its domain infrastructure.\n\nMore specifically, RedEcho has now parked web domains it previously used to control\nShadowPad malware inside the hacked Indian power grid, and which Recorded Future\nousted in its report.\n\n“The most recently identified victim communications with RedEcho infrastructure was from\nan Indian IP address on March 11, 2021 to the RedEcho IP 210.92.18[.]132,” the Insikt\nGroup said.\n\nBut this was to be expected. Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like RedEcho often\nreact to public disclosure by moving infrastructure to new servers.\n\n“This is likely due to a combination of defensive measures taken by targeted organizations to\nblock published network indicators and the aforementioned steps taken by the group to move\naway from publicized infrastructure,” Insikt Group analyst said.\n\nFurthermore, cyber-espionage operations are most efficient when undetected. Once\noperations get exposed, security firms will often work in the shadows to notify victims and\nintelligence services in the targeted countries, and even poison the attacker’s collected data.\n\nTags\n\n[APT](https://therecord.media/tag/apt/)\n[China](https://therecord.media/tag/china/)\n[domain](https://therecord.media/tag/domain/)\n[India](https://therecord.media/tag/india/)\n[Insikt Group](https://therecord.media/tag/insikt-group/)\n[nation-state](https://therecord.media/tag/nation-state-2/)\n[parked domain](https://therecord.media/tag/parked-domain/)\n[Recorded Future](https://therecord.media/tag/recorded-future/)\n[RedEcho](https://therecord.media/tag/redecho/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
