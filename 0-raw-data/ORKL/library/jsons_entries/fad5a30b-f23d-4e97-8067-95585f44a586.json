Within the large volumes of samples submitted daily to these**\n\n**services, some submissions appear to be different from others and show interesting**\n\n**[characteristics. At USENIX Security 2015 I presented a](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity15/technical-sessions)** **[paper in which we proposed a](http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/docs/usenixsec15_graziano.pdf)**\n\n**method to automatically discover malware developments from samples submitted to**\n\n**[online dynamic analysis systems. The research was conducted by dissecting the Anubis](https://anubis.iseclab.org/)**\n\n**sandbox dataset which consisted of over 30M samples collected in six years. The**\n\n**methodology we proposed was effective and we were able to detect many interesting**\n\n**cases in which the malware authors directly interacted with the sandbox during the**\n\n**development phase of the threats.**\n\n**Another interesting result that came from the research concerns the samples attributed to**\n\n**Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns. Surprisingly, some of the malware samples**\n\n**used in these sophisticated attacks had been submitted to the Anubis sandbox months --**\n\n**sometimes even years -- before the attack had been attributed to the proper APT**\n\n**campaign by a security vendor. To be perfectly clear, we are not saying that it took security**\n\n**vendors months or years to detect a threat. Most times, we are able to detect the threats**\n\n**in no more than a few hours. It is just that the malware samples were mislabeled and not**\n\n**properly associated with APT campaigns. In general, the same goes for non-APT malware**\n\n**campaigns. In this blog post, we tried to see if the same applied to the Cisco dataset.**\n\n**Specifically, we chose ten APT campaigns, -- some of which were already covered in the�**\n\n**Usenix paper. We decided to inspect two different datasets: our incoming sample feeds /**\n\n**malware zoo, and the telemetry associated with our Advanced Malware Protection (AMP)**\n\n**solutions. Talos receives samples from over 100 external feeds ranging from anti-malware**\n\n**companies to research centers, while the AMP dataset contains telemetry from the Cisco**\n\n**[AMP user-base.](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/advanced-malware-protection/index.html)**\n\n**The remaining part of this post is organized as follows. First, we show the APT campaigns**\n\n**we investigated Second we summarize the results of the analysis of the Talos dataset**\n\n\n-----\n\n## A P T C A M P A I G N S\n\n**APT CAMPAIGN** **MADE PUBLIC**\n\n**Beebus** **February 2013**\n\n**Arid Viper** **February 2015**\n\n**Red October** **January 2013**\n\n**Equation** **February 2015**\n\n**Pacific RAT�** **July 2014**\n\n**Regin** **November 2014**\n\n**Aurora** **January 2010**\n\n**Pitty Tiger** **July 2014**\n\n**Net Traveller** **June 2013**\n\n**BrutPOS** **July 2014**\n\n**The ten malware campaigns in the table above garnered significant media attention when�**\n\n**discovered, with some of them clearly falling in the area of APT. They were found by**\n\n**different security companies between 2010 and 2015, having different levels of**\n\n**sophistication and different objectives. Moreover, these APT campaigns were not limited**\n\n**to western countries. They have affected organizations all over the world. Most of the time,**\n\n**connecting the dots and drawing relationships between samples and campaigns take**\n\n**months and many experts. This means the security company that releases a detailed**\n\n**report documenting the campaign is aware of it long before the information is made public.**\n\n**However, we believe the “public release” date is still a good metric, because it is the**\n\n**moment at which all the other security companies and the entire world are made aware of**\n\n**these threats.**\n\n**Another important aspect during an APT investigation is attribution. While detection is**\n\n**done quickly, attribution for these campaigns is often an open and hard problem to solve.**\n\n**Most of the times the perpetrators remain unknown even after months of work by security**\n\n**researchers. However, sometimes researchers are able to connect the dots and attribute**\n\n**the attack to a threat actor. This was the case for some of the APT campaigns discussed**\n\n**so far. Some of these threats have been attributed to state-sponsored actors, others to**\n\n**cyber criminals or to espionage attacks. However, like in the USENIX publication, in this**\n\n**post we will make no speculation about attribution.**\n\n**In the next paragraphs, we will present the results of searching for samples associated**\n\n**with these APT campaigns in our datasets.**\n\n|APT CAMPAIGN|MADE PUBLIC|\n|---|---|\n|Beebus|February 2013|\n|Arid Viper|February 2015|\n|Red October|January 2013|\n|Equation|February 2015|\n|Pacific RAT�|July 2014|\n|Regin|November 2014|\n|Aurora|January 2010|\n|Pitty Tiger|July 2014|\n|Net Traveller|June 2013|\n|BrutPOS|July 2014|\n\n\n-----\n\n|APT CAMPAIGN|AVG DAYS BEFORE APT CAMPAIGN PUBLICALLY IDENTIFIED|\n|---|---|\n|Beebus|574|\n|Arid Viper|178|\n|Red October|68|\n|Equation|1371|\n|Pacific RAT�|455|\n|Regin|1018|\n|Aurora|80|\n|Pitty Tiger|602|\n|Net Traveller|105|\n|BrutPOS|68|\n\n\n**This table shows the results of the analysis of our incoming sample feeds/malware zoo.**\n\n**For every campaign, we checked in our malware zoo to see when they had been initially**\n\n**submitted to us. Given that we know when information about these APT campaigns was**\n\n**made public, we can compute the number of days it took the security community to**\n\n**publicly tie the samples to an APT campaign, even though the samples had been marked**\n\n**malicious for other reasons. On average, these samples went for 458 days before being**\n\n**tied to an APT campaign. The table presents the average number of days for the entire**\n\n**campaign, and we go from a few months as in the case of “Aurora” to more than three**\n\n**years for “Equation”. Notice that these figures come from our malware zoo which collects�**\n\n**samples from external sources and in general are a good indicator given the amount of**\n\n**samples received per day. Notice that these numbers vary based on the dataset.**\n\n## V I R U S T O T A L\n\n**The vast majority of the submissions come from big organizations such as Antivirus**\n\n**[companies. Interestingly, a significant percentage is submitted by �VirusTotal. For this](https://www.virustotal.com/)**\n\n**reason we decided to check the submitters for possible links and intelligence information.**\n\n**[As already documented by Dixon, information about the submitters of samples is not](http://blog.9bplus.com/watching-attackers-through-virustotal/)**\n\n**publicly available, but can partially be retrieved from their Intelligence service. For every**\n\n**sample, it is possible to know a hash (a hexadecimal unique identifier of the submitter), the�**\n\n**country (from the geolocalization of the IP address of the submitter) and the method (the**\n\n**way the sample has been submitted, for instance via the web interface or the APIs). This**\n\n**opaque information complicates the analysis a little bit, but it is still possible to obtain**\n\n**interesting results.**\n\n\n-----\n\n|6exxxxxx|AridViper Nettraveller RedOctober BrutPOS PittyTiger|\n|---|---|\n|14xxxxxx|AridViper Regin|\n|22xxxxxx|AridViper Regin Nettraveller BrutPOS PittyTiger|\n|20xxxxxx|AridViper Nettraveller PacificRAT BrutPOS� PittyTiger|\n|5exxxxxx|Equation Regin BrutPOS Auror|\n|72xxxxxx|Equation Regin BrutPOS|\n|4bxxxxxx|Regin|\n|3bxxxxxx|Regin|\n|cdxxxxxx|Beebus PittyTiger Nettraveller BrutPOS|\n|b4xxxxxx|Aurora|\n\n\n**The table above summarizes our findings from VirusTotal.

Many times, malware is initially submitted to sandbox systems and marked as**\n\n**malicious based on the output of the sandbox. Then the authors use that information to**\n\n**tweak the sample to avoid detection in future sandbox runs through various evasion**\n\n**tactics. In other situations, the initial sample may not even be flagged as malicious due to�**\n\n**evasion techniques being utilized.
