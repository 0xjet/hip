We include videos for different analysis methods._\n\nIn [part 1, we explain that Cobalt Strike traffic is encrypted using RSA and AES cryptography,](https://blog.nviso.eu/2021/10/21/cobalt-strike-using-known-private-keys-to-decrypt-traffic-part-1/)\nand that we found private RSA keys that can help with decryption of Cobalt Strike traffic\n\nIn [part 2, we actually decrypt traffic using private keys. Notice that one of the free, open](https://blog.nviso.eu/2021/10/27/cobalt-strike-using-known-private-keys-to-decrypt-traffic-part-2/)\nsource tools that we created to decrypt Cobalt Strike traffic, [cs-parse-http-traffic.py, was a](https://github.com/DidierStevens/Beta/blob/master/cs-parse-http-traffic.py)\n[beta release. It has now been replaced by tool cs-parse-traffic.py. This tool is capable to](https://github.com/DidierStevens/DidierStevensSuite/blob/master/cs-parse-traffic.py)\ndecrypt HTTP(S) and DNS traffic. For HTTP(S), it’s a drop-in replacement for cs-parse-httptraffic.py.\n\nIn [part 3, we use process memory dumps to extract the decryption keys. This is for use](https://blog.nviso.eu/2021/11/03/cobalt-strike-using-process-memory-to-decrypt-traffic-part-3/)\ncases where we don’t have the private keys.\n\nIn [part 4, we deal with some specific obfuscation: data transforms of encrypted traffic, and](https://blog.nviso.eu/2021/11/17/cobalt-strike-decrypting-obfuscated-traffic-part-4/)\nsleep mode in beacons’ process memory.\n\nIn [part 5, we handle Cobalt Strike DNS traffic.](https://blog.nviso.eu/2021/11/29/cobalt-strike-decrypting-dns-traffic-part-5/)\n\nAnd finally, in [part 6, we provide some tips to make memory dumps of Cobalt Strike beacons.](https://blog.nviso.eu/2022/03/11/cobalt-strike-memory-dumps-part-6/)\n\n[The tools used in these blog post are free and open source, and can be found here.](https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/cobalt-strike-tools/)\n\nHere are a couple of videos that illustrate the methods discussed in this series:\n\n[Using Known Private Keys To Decrypt Traffic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z6YAFs-l4)\n[Using Process Memory To Decrypt Traffic](https://youtu.be/7OvqebeLe1E)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Dealing With Obfuscated Traffic And Process Memory](https://youtu.be/jRKhfh1ogiE)\n[Decrypting DNS Traffic](https://youtu.be/exJcDd9AWnk)\n\n[YouTube playlist “Cobalt Strike: Decrypting Traffic“](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z6YAFs-l4&list=PLo4ItFFtz-jwE29gJz-JkjWUWCnHmeYvo)\n\nBlog posts in this series:\n\n[Cobalt Strike: Using Known Private Keys To Decrypt Traffic – Part 1](https://blog.nviso.eu/2021/10/21/cobalt-strike-using-known-private-keys-to-decrypt-traffic-part-1/)\n[Cobalt Strike: Using Known Private Keys To Decrypt Traffic – Part 2](https://blog.nviso.eu/2021/10/27/cobalt-strike-using-known-private-keys-to-decrypt-traffic-part-2/)\n[Cobalt Strike: Using Process Memory To Decrypt Traffic – Part 3](https://blog.nviso.eu/2021/11/03/cobalt-strike-using-process-memory-to-decrypt-traffic-part-3/)\n[Cobalt Strike: Decrypting Obfuscated Traffic – Part 4](https://blog.nviso.eu/2021/11/17/cobalt-strike-decrypting-obfuscated-traffic-part-4/)\n[Cobalt Strike: Decrypting DNS Traffic – Part 5](https://blog.nviso.eu/2021/11/29/cobalt-strike-decrypting-dns-traffic-part-5/)\n[Cobalt Strike: Memory Dumps – Part 6](https://blog.nviso.eu/2022/03/11/cobalt-strike-memory-dumps-part-6/)\n\n**About the authors**\n\nDidier Stevens is a malware expert working for NVISO.
