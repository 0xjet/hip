This is done through a series of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gandcrab-ransomware-distributed-by-exploit-kits-appends-gdcb-extension/)\nmalicious documents that ultimately install the ransomware via a PowerShell script.\n\nThe start of the chain of events that lead to the installation of GandCrab is when a victim\nreceives an email with a subject like \"Receipt Feb-078122\". These emails contain a PDF\nattachment with names like Feb01221812.pdf as shown below.\n\n**Malspam Pretending to be a Receipt**\n\nWhen a user opens this PDF, they will be shown a prompt that pretends to be a\ncaptcha asking the user to confirm they are human.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fake Captcha**\n\nWhen a user clicks on the captcha, the PDF file downloads a malicious word document.\nWhen opened, this document will contain the standard social engineering text that tries to\nconvince the user to enable macros by clicking on the Enable Content button.\n\n**Malicious Word Document**\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce a user clicks on the Enable Content button it will trigger the malicious macro shown\nbelow.\n\n**Malicious Word Macro**\n\nThis macro will launch a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a PowerShell\n[script from a remote site. As pointed out by security researcher Derek Knight, this script](http://myonlinesecurity.co.uk/fake-receipt-malspam-delivers-gandcrab-ransomware-via-pdf-dropping-macro-dropping-exploit-file/)\nspecifically calls the PowerShell command in a folder that only exists on 64 bit versions of\nWindows. Therefore, those who are running 32-bit versions of Windows will be protected\nfrom this macro.\n\nThe PowerShell that is executed by the Word document is seen below.\n\n**PowerShell Command**\n\nWhen the sct5 PowerShell script is executed, it will decode an embedded\nGandCrab executable and launch it.\n\n\n-----\n\n**PowerShell Installer**\n\nOnce launched, GandCrab will connect to the remote Command & Control servers and begin\nencrypting a victim's computer.\n\nAs you can see, this all started simply by opening a malicious PDF contained in malspam.\nThis is why it is very important to be careful not to open any attachments unless you confirm\nthat they were actually sent by the sender. If the sender is not someone you know, then do\nnot open it at all to be safe.\n\nFor those who are infected with this ransomware, you can request help in our GandCrab Help\n& Support topic.\n\nBe smart and stay safe!\n\n**[Update 2/8/18 10:45 AM: Added information from Derek Knight about how the macro](https://twitter.com/dvk01uk)**\ncalls the PowerShell command in a folder that only exists on 64-bit versions of Windows.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-exposes-data-of-500-000-chicago-students/)\n\n[GandCrab](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/gandcrab/)\n[MalSpam](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malspam/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
