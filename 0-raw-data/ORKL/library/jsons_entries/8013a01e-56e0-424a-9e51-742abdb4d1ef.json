Among the identified targets are organizations in the\ndefense, healthcare, and information and communications technology (ICT) sectors. The\ncampaign appears to have begun in September 2020 and ran at least until May 2021.\n\nThe toolset used by the attackers includes loaders, a modular backdoor, a keylogger, and an\nexfiltration tool designed to abuse cloud storage service Dropbox.\n\n## Attacker toolbox\n\nThe initial infection vector employed by the attackers remains unknown. The earliest sign of\nattempted compromise is a loader that decrypts and loads a payload from a .dat file. At least\ntwo different file names have been observed for the .dat file: sdc-integrity.dat and scsintegrity.dat. The loader also calls the DumpAnalyze export from the decrypted payload.\n\nThe payload has yet to be identified but is almost certainly a modular backdoor. This can be\ninferred from one of the modules identified. This \"Orchestrator\" module points to the\nexistence of a separate DLL module that exposes at least 16 functions, as well as the\nexistence of a custom binary command and control (C&C) protocol used by Orchestrator but\nimplemented separately.\n\nThis module appears to be a core component of the backdoor. It runs as a Windows service\nand a large part of its functionality is implemented in a separate DLL that is loaded from\nregistry (located in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.z\\OpenWithProgidsEx\\\n<value_name_resolved_at_runtime>).\n\nThe module is expected to export the following functions:\n\nConstruct\nConnectHost1\nForceCloseSocket\nAccept\nRecv\nRecvEx\nSend\nSendEx\nBindShell\nTransmitData_htran\nKillChildenProcessTree (sic)\n\n\n-----\n\nExtractIPToConnect\nExtractIPToConnect1\nGetDeviceInfoString1\nGetPseudoSocketInfo\nDecrypt_ByteToByte\n\nThe module loads a configuration either from a file\n(CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Crypto\\RSA\\Keys.dat) or from the registry\n(HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.z\\OpenWithProgidsEx\\CONFIG). The configuration is encrypted.\nThe module uses the function Decrypt_ByteToByte from the separate DLL to decrypt the\nconfiguration. The configuration is expected to contain the following options (stored in XML\nformat):\n\nFLAG\nIp\nDns\nCntPort\nLstPort\nBlog\nDropboxBlog\nSvcName\nSvcDisp\nSvcDesc\nSvcDll\nOlPass\nOlTime\nSelfDestroy\n\nThe module also uses the hardcoded mutex name, Global\\QVomit4.\n\nOther tools used in the campaign include a keylogger, which shows signs of being authored\nby the same developer, sharing unique strings with other tools and string obfuscation\ntechniques. The attackers also used 7zr, a legitimate tool that is a lightweight version of the\n7-Zip archiver, in addition to a data-exfiltration tool that sends stolen data to Dropbox.\n\n## Possible false flags\n\nThe nature of the targets and the tools used have all the hallmarks of an espionage\noperation. Symantec has yet to attribute the attacks to a known actor and it appears that the\nattackers took some steps to complicate attribution. For example, it is not clear what\nlanguage the group speaks and samples of the backdoor module found contained strings in\nwhat appeared to be both Cyrillic and Urdu scripts.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe only potential clue found to date is that one of the organizations attacked was also\ntargeted by a tool used by the China-linked Leafhopper group (aka APT30) during the same\ntime period. However, there is no evidence as yet to tie the tool to this campaign.\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\n[For the latest protection updates, please visit the Symantec Protection Bulletin.](https://www.broadcom.com/support/security-center/protection-bulletin)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Hash** **Description**\n\nac4b50727c69ca7cc3c0a926bb1b75418a8a0eabd369a4f7118bb9bba880e06 Loader\n\nb04be710feba6a070107ff276e1e17e348f534eb9be142271e1ea2fcffa1ef9b Loader\n\nb25f3e8d1b7fcef6a54fc959d7e82c6a4e2da3836e98766ae4a157484da0b9b1 Loader\n\n1af5252cadbe8cef16b4d73d4c4886ee9cecddd3625e28a59b59773f5a2a9f7f Orchestrator\nmodule\n\na6f75af45c331a3fac8d2ce010969f4954e8480cbe9f9ea19ce3c51c44d17e98 Orchestrator\nmodule\n\nd1ff2ded43e2d9c2e6e07e71f0e3adb815ea0eef7ca391ee272b874807add4a Orchestrator\nmodule\n\n7904ce020b55a6343005db5a5dad7d841db8300fb270c78e8585903e1de13e2 Exfiltration\ntool\n\na15eda7c75cf4aa14182c3d44dc492957e9a9569e2d318881e5705da2b882324 Keylogger\n\n967e8063bd9925c2c8dd80d86a6b01deb5af54e44825547a60c48528fb5f896d Keylogger\n\n64f036f98aad41185163cb328636788a8c6b4e1082ae336dad42b79617e4813d Keylogger\n\n91b3022e776d1ffb350e550911d08f10d30678bcb4c17d9c0ae5088f5e63146e Unknown\nfile\n\nc3aee1f79e27af6ddc8ded38bfdfab004ad489c8f81f7928cfea5c05a3605338 Suspected\nloader\n\n37d0c0afaa77c7363b6515eff9590eba546cce2a751a454d5200a25b7c24dfef Unknown\nfile\n\n\n-----\n\n## About the Author\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n**Symantec**\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to\ninvestigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer\nanalysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n## Want to comment on this post?\n\n\n-----",
