These have been highly active in the\nMiddle East region and unveiled ongoing targeted attacks in multiple regions. The attackers try to lure targets through spear phishing emails\nthat include compressed executables. The malware collects all data such as passwords, keystrokes and screenshots, then sends it to the\nattackers.\n\n#OpGhoul targeting industrial, manufacturing and engineering organizations in 30+ countries\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Foperation-ghoul-targeted-attacks-on-industrial-and-engineering-organizations%2F75718%2F&text=%23OpGhoul+targeting+industrial%2C+manufacturing+and+engineering+organizations+in+30%2B+countries)\n\nWe found that the group behind this campaign targeted mainly industrial, engineering and manufacturing organizations in more than 30\ncountries. In total, over 130 organizations have been identified as victims of this campaign. Using the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) and\nartifacts from malware files and attack sites, we were able to trace the attacks back to March 2015. Noteworthy is that since the beginning of\ntheir activities, the attackers’ motivations are apparently financial, whether through the victims’ banking accounts or through selling their\nintellectual property to interested parties, most infiltrated victim organizations are considered SMBs (Small to Medium size businesses, 30-300\nemployees), the utilization of commercial off-the-shelf malware makes the attribution of the attacks more difficult.\n\nIn total, over 130 organizations have been identified as victims of Operation Ghoul #OpGhoul\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Foperation-ghoul-targeted-attacks-on-industrial-and-engineering-organizations%2F75718%2F&text=In+total%2C+over+130+organizations+have+been+identified+as+victims+of+Operation+Ghoul+%23OpGhoul)\n\nIn ancient Folklore, the Ghoul is an evil spirit associated with consuming human flesh and hunting kids, originally a Mesopotamian demon.\nToday, the term is sometimes used to describe a greedy or materialistic individual.\n\n## Main infection vector: malicious emails\n\nThe following picture represents emails that are being used to deliver malware to the victims, in what looks like a payment document. The emails sent by attackers appear to be coming from a bank in the UAE, the Emirates NBD, and include a 7z file with malware. In other cases,\nvictims received phishing links. A quick analysis of the email headers reveals fake sources being utilised to deliver the emails to victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Malicious attachments\n\nIn the case of spear phishing emails with an attachment, the 7z does not contain payment instructions but a malware executable\n(EmiratesNBD_ADVICE.exe). We have observed executables with the following MD5s:\n\n**Malware MD5 hashes**\n\nfc8da575077ae3db4f9b5991ae67dab1\n\nb8f6e6a0cb1bcf1f100b8d8ee5cccc4c\n\n08c18d38809910667bbed747b2746201\n\n55358155f96b67879938fe1a14a00dd6\n\n**Email file MD5 hashes**\n\n5f684750129e83b9b47dc53c96770e09\n\n460e18f5ae3e3eb38f8cae911d447590\n\nThe spear phishing emails are mostly sent to senior members and executives of targeted organizations, most likely because the attackers\nhope to get access to core intelligence, controlling accounts and other interesting information from people who have the following positions or\nsimilar:\n\nChief Executive Officer\nChief Operations Officer\nGeneral Manager\nGeneral Manager, Sales and Marketing\nDeputy General Manager\nFinance and Admin Manager\nBusiness Development Manager\nManager\nExport manager\nFinance Manager\nPurchase manager\nHead of Logistics\nSales Executive\nSupervisor\nEngineer\n\n\n-----\n\n## Technical details\n\n### Malware functionality\n\nThe malware is based on the Hawkeye commercial spyware, which provides a variety of tools for the attackers, in addition to malware\nanonymity from attribution. It initiates by self-deploying and configuring persistence, while using anti-debugging and timeout techniques, then\nstarts collecting interesting data from the victim’s device, including:\n\nKeystrokes\nClipboard data\nFileZilla ftp server credentials\nAccount data from local browsers\nAccount data from local messaging clients (Paltalk, Google talk, AIM…)\nAccount data from local email clients (Outlook, Windows Live mail…)\nLicense information of some installed applications\n\n#OpGhoul malware collects all data such as #passwords, keystrokes and screenshots\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Foperation-ghoul-targeted-attacks-on-industrial-and-engineering-organizations%2F75718%2F&text=%23OpGhoul+malware+collects+all+data+such+as+%23passwords%2C+keystrokes+and+screenshots)\n\n**Data exfiltration**\n\nData is collected by the attackers using primarily:\n\nHttp GET posts\n\nSent to hxxp://192.169.82.86\n\nEmail messages\n\nmail.ozlercelikkapi[.]com (37.230.110.53), mail to info@ozlercelikkapi[.]com\nmail.eminenture[.]com (192.185.140.232), mail to eminfo@eminenture[.]com\n\nBoth ozlercelikkapi[.]com and eminenture[.]com seem to belong to compromised organisations operating in manufacturing and technology\nservices.\n\n### Malware command center\n\nThe malware connects to 192.169.82.86 to deliver collected information from the victim’s PC. This information includes passwords, clipboard\ndata, screenshots…\n\nhxxp://192.169.82.86/~loftyco/skool/login.php\n\nhxxp://192.169.82.86/~loftyco/okilo/login.php\n\nThe IP address 192.169.82.86 seems to belong to a compromised device running multiple malware campaigns.\n\n## Victim information\n\nVi ti i ti di t ib t d i diff t t i ld id ith tt k f d t i t i th th\n\n\n-----\n\n_Number of Victim Organisations by Country_\n\nCountries marked as “others” have less than three victim organizations each, they are: Switzerland, Gibraltar, USA, Sweden, China, France,\nAzerbaijan, Iraq, Turkey, Romania, Iran, Iraq and Italy.\n\n### Victim industry information\n\nVictim industry types were also indicators of targeted attacks as attackers were looking to infiltrate organizations that belong to the product life\ncycle of multiple goods, especially industrial equipment.\n\n#Manufacturing #transportation #travel targets of #OpGhoul\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Foperation-ghoul-targeted-attacks-on-industrial-and-engineering-organizations%2F75718%2F&text=%23Manufacturing+%23transportation+%23travel+targets+of+%23OpGhoul)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Number of Victim Organizations by Industry Type_\n\n**Victim industry description**\n\n**Industrial** Petrochemical, naval, military, aerospace, heavy machinery, solar energy, steel, pumps, plastics\n\n**Engineering** Construction, architecture, automation, chemical, transport, water\n\n**Shipping** International freight shipping\n\n**Pharmaceutical** Production/research of pharmaceutical and beauty products\n\n**Manufacturing** Furniture, decor, textiles\n\n**Trading** Industrial, electronics and food trading\n\n**Education** Training centers, universities, academic publishing\n\n**Tourism** Travel agencies\n\n**Technology/IT** Providers of IT technologies and consulting services\n\n**Unknown** Unidentified victims\n\n### The last attack waves\n\nKaspersky Lab user statistics indicate the new waves of attacks that started in June 2016 are focused on certain countries more than others.\n\n#opghoul highly active in #MiddleEast\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Foperation-ghoul-targeted-attacks-on-industrial-and-engineering-organizations%2F75718%2F&text=%23opghoul+highly+active+in+%23MiddleEast)\n\nHundreds of detections have been reported by Kaspersky Lab users; 70% of the attacked users were found in the United Arab Emirates alone,\nthe other 30% were distributed in Russia, Malaysia, India, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Algeria, Germany, Iran, Egypt, Japan, Switzerland,\nBahrain and Tunisia.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Other attack information\n\nPhishing pages have also been spotted through 192.169.82.86, and although they are taken down quickly, more than 150 user accounts were\nidentified as victims of the phishing links sent by the attackers. Victims were connecting from the following devices and inserting their\ncredentials, a reminder that phishing attacks do work on all platforms:\n\nWindows\nMac OS X\nUbuntu\niPhone\nAndroid\n\n**The malware files are detected using the following heuristic signatures:**\n\nTrojan.MSIL.ShopBot.ww\n\nTrojan.Win32.Fsysna.dfah\n\nTrojan.Win32.Generic\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOperation Ghoul is one of the many attacks in the wild targeting industrial, manufacturing and engineering organizations, Kaspersky Lab\nrecommends users to be extra cautious while checking and opening emails and attachments. In addition, privileged users need to be well\ntrained and ready to deal with cyber threats; failure in this is, in most cases, the cause behind private or corporate data leakage, reputation and\nfinancial loss.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nThe following are common among the different malware infections; the presence of these is an indication of a possible infection.\n\n### Filenames and paths related to malware\n\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\bthserv.exe\n\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\BsBhvScan.exe\n\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Local\\Client\\WinHttpAutoProxySync.exe\n\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Local\\Client\\WdiServiceHost.exe\n\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AF7B1841C6A70C858E3201422E2D0BEA.dat\n\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Helper\\Browser.txt\n\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Helper\\Mail.txt\n\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Helper\\Mess.txt\n\n\n-----\n\nC \\Use s\\%Use a e%\\ pp ata\\ oa g\\ e pe \\OS t t\nC:\\ProgramData\\Mails.txt\nC:\\ProgramData\\Browsers.txt\n\n### List of malware related MD5 hashes\n\n55358155f96b67879938fe1a14a00dd6\n\nf9ef50c53a10db09fc78c123a95e8eec\n\nb8f6e6a0cb1bcf1f100b8d8ee5cccc4c\n\n07b105f15010b8c99d7d727ff3a9e70f\n\nae2a78473d4544ed2acd46af2e09633d\n\n21ea64157c84ef6b0451513d0d11d02e\n\n08c18d38809910667bbed747b2746201\n\nfc8da575077ae3db4f9b5991ae67dab1\n\n8d46ee2d141176e9543dea9bf1c079c8\n\n36a9ae8c6d32599f21c9d1725485f1a3\n\ncc6926cde42c6e29e96474f740d12a78\n\n6e959ccb692668e70780ff92757d2335\n\n3664d7150ac98571e7b5652fd7e44085\n\nd87d26309ef01b162882ee5069dc0bde\n\n5a97d62dc84ede64846ea4f3ad4d2f93\n\n5a68f149c193715d13a361732f5adaa1\n\ndabc47df7ae7d921f18faf685c367889\n\naaee8ba81bee3deb1c95bd3aaa6b13d7\n\n460e18f5ae3e3eb38f8cae911d447590\n\nc3cf7b29426b9749ece1465a4ab4259e\n\n### List of malware related domains\n\nIndyproject[.]org\n\nStudiousb[.]com\n\ncopylines[.]biz\n\nGlazeautocaree[.]com\n\nBrokelimiteds[.]in\n\nmeedlifespeed[.]com\n\n468213579[.]com\n\n468213579[.]com\n\n357912468[.]com\n\naboranian[.]com\n\napple-recovery[.]us\n\nsecurity-block[.]com\n\ncom-wn[.]in\n\nf444c4f547116bfd052461b0b3ab1bc2b445a[.]com\n\ndeluxepharmacy[.]net\n\nkatynew[.]pw\n\nMercadojs[.]com\n\n### Observed phishing URLs\n\nhxxp://free.meedlifespeed[.]com/ComCast/\nhxxp://emailreferentie.appleid.apple.nl.468213579[.]com/\n\nhxxp://468213579[.]com/emailreferentie.appleid.apple.nl/emailverificatie-40985443/home/login.php\n\nhxxp://verificatie.appleid.apple.nl.referentie.357912468[.]com/emailverificatie-40985443/home/lo…\n\nhxxp://192.169.82.86/~gurgenle/verify/webmail/\n\nhxxp://customer.comcast.com.aboranian[.]com/login\n\nhxxp://apple-recovery[.]us/\n\nhxxp://apple.security-block[.]com/Apple%20-%20My%20Apple%20ID.html\n\nhxxp://cgi.ebay.com-wn[.]in/itm/2000-Jeep-Wrangler-Sport-4×4-/?ViewItem&item=17475607809\n\nhxxp://https.portal.apple.com.idmswebauth.login.html.appidkey.05c7e09b5896b0334b3af1139274f266b2hxxp://2b68.f444c4f547116bfd052461b0b\nhxxp://www.deluxepharmacy[.]net\n\n### Other malware links\n\nMalware links observed on 192.169.82.86 dating back to March and April 2016:\n\n\n-----\n\np //g a eautoca ee[ ]co /p o o a o ce e e\nhxxp://brokelimiteds[.]in/cdn/images/bro.exe\nhxxp://brokelimiteds[.]in/cdn/images/onowu.exe\nhxxp://brokelimiteds[.]in/cdn/images/obe.exe\nhxxp://brokelimiteds[.]in/wp-admin/css/upload/order.exe\nhxxp://brokelimiteds[.]in/wp-admin/css/upload/orders.exe\nhxxp://papercuts[.]info/SocialMedia/java.exe\nhxxp://studiousb[.]com/mercadolivrestudio/f.zip\nhxxp://copylines[.]biz/lasagna/gate.php?request=true\n\n[For more information on how you can protect your business from similar attacks, please visit this post from Kaspersky Business.](https://business.kaspersky.com/ghoul/5897/)\n\n\n-----",
