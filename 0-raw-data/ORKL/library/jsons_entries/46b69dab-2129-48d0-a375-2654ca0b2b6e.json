Thousands of organizations were affected when the](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/solarwinds)\nupdate mechanism for SolarWinds’ Orion software was compromised in\norder to deliver a backdoor Trojan known as Sunburst (Backdoor.Sunburst).\nInformation about this attack campaign emerged in December 2020, with\nthe activity thought to have been ongoing since at least March of that year.\n\nSupply chain attacks, such as the SolarWinds hack, are indiscriminate,\ninfecting all users of a compromised software, even though attackers\nmay only be interested in a handful of them. In the case of SolarWinds,\nadditional malicious activity was seen on the networks of a small subset of\nthe original victims.\n\nThe SolarWinds hack is reminiscent of similar supply chain attacks of recent\n[years that had a large number of victims, such as the CCleaner attack. In](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-hid-malware-in-ccleaner-pc-tool-for-nearly-a-month/)\nthat incident a compromised software update led to millions of devices\nbecoming infected, even though the attackers were only interested in a\nhandful of machines.\n\n\n-----\n\nA compromised software update is just one way of carrying out a supply chain attack, with several other methods\nof compromising victims also leveraged by attackers carrying out these attacks. This paper will go through the\ndifferent types of supply chain attacks, detail some notable examples, contemplate why this is a growing issue for\nbusinesses, and what the future might hold in this space.\n\nSome of the key areas covered in this white paper include:\n\n  - Updated metrics about the number of Symantec customers impacted by the SolarWinds supply chain attack,\nand an in-depth examination of this significant cyber incident\n\n  - A case study, including previously unpublished information, about a supply chain attack that has been linked\nin public reports to the North Korea backed Lazarus APT group\n\n  - How publicly reported supply chain attacks increased fivefold between 2016 and 2020\n\n  - Whether or not multi-stage supply chain attacks are something your organization needs to worry about\n\n  - Why and how malicious actors might leverage a supply chain attack to target your business, and steps your\norganization can take to reduce its risk\n\n#### Software Supply Chain Attacks Explained\n\nSoftware supply chain attacks really started to take off around 2017, with at least one supply chain attack publicly\nreported every month in that year, while less than a handful of these types of attacks had been reported in the\n[preceding few years. In the Internet Security Threat Report 23 (ISTR 23), we defined a software supply chain attack](https://docs.broadcom.com/docs/istr-23-2018-en)\nas the following:\n\n“Inserting a Trojan into an otherwise legitimate software package at the regular\ndistribution place; this can be at the creation phase at the vendor, third-party\nstorage location, or by redirection.”\n\nThis definition largely stands to this day, with supply chain attacks having become increasingly frequent since\ntheir growth in popularity began in 2017. Supply chain attacks are useful for attackers as they can allow them to\ninfiltrate even well-guarded organizations if they are able to compromise the software of one of the organizations’\ntrusted partners. The typical attack scenario - as seen in the SolarWinds hack and the CCleaner incident - involves\nthe attacker replacing a legitimate software update with a malicious version in order to distribute it quickly and\nsurreptitiously to intended targets. Any user applying the software update will automatically have their computer\ninfected and will give the attacker a foothold on their network.\n\nSpreading malware through an already established distribution channel allows attackers to compromise a large\nnumber of computers in a short period of time, especially if the compromised software has an automated update\nmechanism. Added to this, supply chain attacks are often difficult for the average user to spot, or for security\nsoftware to stop. The compromised update is downloaded from a legitimate, trusted domain that generally has\nthe required permission to perform network connections and execute downloaded binaries. In some cases, the\ndownloaded binary even has a valid digital certificate.\n\nMalicious actors that leverage supply chain attacks rarely want or need access to all the machines that they\ncompromise through the Trojanized update process. However, the initial access allows them to carry out\nreconnaissance on infected machines before they identify those they are interested in. They generally then\ndeploy a second-stage payload onto machines of interest. Supply chain attacks can also allow attackers to carry\nout a certain amount of targeting. For example, if they compromise a software that is known to be used in a\n[certain sector or country. This is what we saw in the NotPetya attack in 2017. The entry point in that attack was](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/petya-ransomware-wiper)\na compromised accounting software widely used in Ukraine. The self-propagating nature of NotPetya, however,\nmeant that it quickly spread beyond its originally targeted geography and caused widespread havoc.\n\nWhen we consider the level of access that successful supply chain attacks can provide to compromised networks, it\nis easy to understand why they are being increasingly used by sophisticated attack groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### How Attackers Compromise the Supply Chain\n\nThere are a few attack methods that cyber attackers use to carry out software update supply chain attacks, with\nthe most common method being compromising a third-party supplier directly. Basically, attackers go after a weak\nlink in the targeted company’s supply chain. This normally means compromising a software supplier, but could\nalso mean compromising a managed service provider (MSP) or IT provider in order to gain access to their clients’\n[networks. We have seen some targeted attack groups, like Cicada (aka APT10), targeting MSPs.](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-japan-espionage)\n\nCompromising a software vendor is the most straightforward path for an attacker wanting to carry out a supply\nchain attack, though it can be complex to achieve depending on the level of security the vendor has in place on its\nown systems.\n\nIf the attacker succeeds in compromising the software vendor, they can then switch the update package with a\nmodified malicious version. One way to achieve this is by compromising the web server where the update packages\nare hosted, which may be achieved by exploiting a vulnerability in the content management tool. But the ultimate\naim for the attacker is to get access to the vendor’s development environment, which may be achieved through a\nsuccessful spear-phishing attack against a developer, credential theft, or through another vector.\n\nIf they achieve elevated enough access, the attacker may also be able to acquire digital certificates that also allow\nthem to code-sign the Trojanized update. This results in the malicious update having a legitimate and trusted digital\nsignature that cannot be distinguished by the user, making the attack almost impossible to detect. While this type\nof attack is difficult to conduct, and would require a high level of skill from the attacker, it is also the most difficult\nto detect, and therefore highly effective.\n\nMost of the high-profile software supply chain attacks of recent times - including SolarWinds, CCleaner, NotPetya,\n[and ASUS - were achieved by the attackers being able to Trojanize the software update before it was delivered to](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/asus-supply-chain-attack)\ncustomers.\n\n**Other Ways of Carrying Out Supply Chain Attacks**\n\nAnother common way of carrying out supply chain attacks is by hijacking third-party hosting services, such as\nGitHub, for example. Not all software vendors host software on their own infrastructure, many use cloud storage,\nwhile others use service providers like GitHub. Open-source projects are particularly likely to use service providers\nlike GitHub and so are particularly susceptible to being compromised in this way.\n\nOne way of compromising open-source projects is to make subtle changes to the source code that attackers may\nthen be able to exploit, however, these kinds of changes could be discovered if the project is reviewed. Another\nmethod is to steal the credentials of someone, most likely a developer, with the requisite permissions to upload new\nbinaries. Developer account credentials are very valuable to cyber criminals.\n\nWe saw several examples of attackers attempting to infect open-source software in 2020 in the hopes it would be\n[used by developers and integrated into their projects. In December 2020, Sonatype reported that it had discovered](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-rubygems-packages-used-in-cryptocurrency-supply-chain-attack/)\n[two malicious packages uploaded to the RubyGems repository, where anyone can upload code written in the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-rubygems-packages-used-in-cryptocurrency-supply-chain-attack/)\nRuby programming language. These malicious packages contained a clipboard hijacker that the attackers used to\n[attempt to steal cryptocurrency from infected machines. In another incident in the same month, the security team](https://www.zdnet.com/article/malicious-npm-packages-caught-installing-remote-access-trojans/)\n[behind the “npm” repository for storing JavaScript packages removed two malicious packages that contained code](https://www.zdnet.com/article/malicious-npm-packages-caught-installing-remote-access-trojans/)\n[that could install a remote access Trojan (RAT) on the computers of developers who downloaded the package. The](https://www.zdnet.com/article/malicious-npm-packages-caught-installing-remote-access-trojans/)\nmalicious packages were downloaded around 100 times before they were discovered. Underlining the threat to\nopen-source projects, the security team at npm said that since August 2020 it had seen an increasing number of\npurposely malicious data-stealing libraries uploaded to its repository. As mentioned, developer account credentials\nare highly valuable to cyber attackers.\n\n[In May a significant supply chain attack targeting developers who use GitHub was revealed. A new malware called](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/github-supply-chain-attack-uses-octopus-scanner-malware/d/d-id/1337943)\nOctopus Scanner was used to compromise 26 open-source projects hosted on the platform. The malware had\nbeen built to insert backdoors into NetBeans projects without the owners of the projects being aware. The malware\nwould then insert a backdoor into any repository or project the compromised code was used in.\n\n\n-----\n\nDomain Hijacking\n\nDomain hijacking is another form of supply chain attack. This could involve, for example, attackers compromising a\ndomain registrar to change the registered name servers for a given domain, or even transfer the whole domain. Or\nthey could attempt to compromise a DNS server to change the domain resolution to a different IP address under\nthe attacker’s control. An even simpler way of doing this is to simply buy a legitimate domain – this is possible if the\n[owner of the domain forgets to renew, something that has happened to some domains owned by some well-known](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/dell-lost-control-of-key-customer-support-domain-for-a-month-in-2017/)\n[companies in recent years. Taking over a domain could allow attackers to redirect users to malicious websites, to](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/dell-lost-control-of-key-customer-support-domain-for-a-month-in-2017/)\nsteal their information, or push Trojanized updates onto their machine.\n\nFormjacking\n\nFormjacking is a term we use to describe the use of malicious JavaScript code to steal credit card details and other\ninformation from payment forms on the checkout web pages of e-commerce sites.\n\nThe malicious code can just be injected directly onto the targeted website, but in many instances formjacking\ncyber criminals use supply chain attacks to gain access to websites. Formjacking (or card skimming) attacks have\nbeen around for a long time, but they really took off in the final quarter of 2018. Supply chain attackers aiming\nto carry out formjacking attacks would often target the networks of third-party companies whose products\nwere used on e-commerce sites to manage analytics, for website support and other services. In one high-profile\n[attack, formjacking attackers were able to gain access to Ticketmaster’s website when code used in a third-party](https://www.theregister.com/2018/06/27/ticketmaster_support_bot_hack/)\ncompany’s chatbot, which was used for customer support on Ticketmaster websites, was compromised.\n\nThe third-party companies targeted by formjacking criminals were generally much smaller than the actual target\ncompany. Smaller companies tend to have less stringent security measures and are easier to compromise than the\nnetwork of a well-known brand.\n\nSupply chain compromise was so important in formjacking attacks that incidents of formjacking accounted for\na significant proportion of the supply chain attacks we saw in 2019. There doesn’t appear to be as many public\nreports of formjacking attacks leveraging weak parts of the supply chain in 2020, although there are still some\nincidents. This could be for a few possible reasons:\n\n  - The attacks have occurred but haven’t yet been publicly revealed\n\n  - Website owners have learned from the incidents of recent years and have improved security on their\ne-commerce sites by removing third-party code from checkout pages\n\n  - Formjacking isn’t the “on-trend” cyber crime it was in 2018 and 2019, with the criminals behind it having\npossibly moved on to other types of cyber crime\n\n  - Cyber criminals are injecting malicious code directly onto targeted websites rather than carrying out the\ncompromise via supply chain attacks.\n\nHowever, the use of third-party code on a website still opens up a business to the possibility of being compromised\nvia this code. Businesses should reduce their exposure by ensuring third-party code is not present on pages where\npersonal information is gathered, such as checkout or login pages, and by monitoring any code changes in their\nenvironment.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### SolarWinds: A Significant Cyber Intrusion\n\nUndoubtedly, one of the most high-profile software supply chain attacks of recent years is also one of the most\n[recent. News of the SolarWinds hack broke in December 2020 and it remained in the headlines for many weeks as](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/sunburst-supply-chain-attack-solarwinds)\ninvestigators discovered more details about the hack. The investigation into this incident is likely to continue well\ninto 2021 with many questions about it still to be answered.\n\n[These attacks became public when security firm FireEye disclosed details of them in December. The campaign had](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\nbeen underway since at least March 2020 and any user of the SolarWinds Orion software who had downloaded\nan update in that time was believed to be impacted - with this amounting to approximately 18,000 organizations.\nThe Trojanized update delivered a backdoor Trojan called Sunburst to affected machines. A subset of these initial\ntargets was then identified by the attackers for further compromise.\n\nSymantec had identified 4,167 customers by the end of January 2021 that had received the first-stage Sunburst\nbackdoor. We also identified a small number of organizations where one of two second-stage payloads were\ndeployed. These second-stage payloads are Backdoor.Teardrop and Backdoor.Raindrop. Initial analysis had\n[uncovered only the first backdoor - Teardrop - but further research by Symantec investigators led to the discovery](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/solarwinds-raindrop-malware)\n[of a second backdoor - Raindrop - which was used for lateral movement on some victim networks.](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/solarwinds-raindrop-malware)\n\nThe compromise of the software occurred when an existing SolarWinds DLL called SolarWinds.Orion.Core.\nBusinessLayer.dll was modified by the attackers to include an added class. This malicious class could:\n\n  - Set delay time before execution (in order to avoid being detected if the software was run in a sandbox)\n\n  - Collect and upload system information\n\n  - Download and run code\n\n  - Iterate the file system\n\n  - Create and delete files\n\n  - Calculate file hashes\n\n  - Read, write, and delete registry entries\n\n  - Reboot the system\n\nThe second-stage malware, Teardrop, was used to deliver the Cobalt Strike commodity malware. Cobalt Strike was\nobserved connecting to a command and control (C&C) server. The attackers attempted to obtain credentials, and\nthey also used the Adfind tool to query Active Directory. The attackers appeared to be looking to gain elevated\nprivileges - such as domain administrator- so they could access the domain or move laterally through the network.\n\nRaindrop - the other second-stage malware observed - also delivered a payload of Cobalt Strike. Raindrop is very\nsimilar to the aforementioned Teardrop tool, but there are some key differences between the two. While Teardrop\nwas delivered by the initial Sunburst backdoor, Raindrop appears to have been used for spreading across the\nvictim’s network. We have seen no evidence of Raindrop being delivered directly by Sunburst, rather it appears\nelsewhere on networks where at least one computer has already been compromised by Sunburst. We have only\nseen Raindrop activity on a small handful of machines so it does not appear to be as widely deployed as Teardrop.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Example Teardrop and Raindrop Activity in a Compromised Organization\n\n**Organization A**\n\n**Machine 1** **Machine 2**\n\n**Trojanized Update**\n\n**Sunburst**\n\n**Teardrop** **Raindrop**\n\n**Cobalt Strike** **Cobalt Strike**\n\n[The motivation behind the attack is speculated to be cyber espionage by many. Public reports have said that there](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2020/12/14/dark-halo-leverages-solarwinds-compromise-to-breach-organizations/)\nis some evidence of the attackers accessing email on targeted networks, but the extent of any spying or exfiltration\nof data isn’t clear.\n\nThe speculation and discussion in the infosecurity and wider community since this attack took place has been wide\n[ranging, with one U.S. politician describing it as “the greatest cyber intrusion, perhaps, in the history of the world.”](https://www.wsj.com/articles/suspected-russian-hack-extends-far-beyond-solarwinds-software-investigators-say-11611921601)\nAnd the impact of the attackers behind this attack wasn’t just felt by SolarWinds customers - with as many as 30%\nof those affected reportedly not customers of SolarWinds. How the attackers initially accessed SolarWinds systems\n[is not yet established. However, Microsoft did also reveal in December that the hackers that targeted SolarWinds](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/)\nhad also accessed its corporate network, but said it had “found no indications” that its systems were used to attack\n[others. However, SolarWinds itself is now reportedly investigating if Microsoft’s cloud was the hackers’ initial entry](https://www.wsj.com/articles/suspected-russian-hack-extends-far-beyond-solarwinds-software-investigators-say-11611921601)\npoint into its network, although this is said to be just one of a number of theories being investigated.\n\nIf this turns out to be the case then it looks like this may have been a multi-stage supply chain attack: where one\ncompany was targeted to gain access to another company, and to then gain access to that company’s customers.\nHowever, that is just in the realm of theory at the moment. One thing is for certain though, investigations into this\nattack are unlikely to finish anytime soon with many questions still to be answered - such as who is behind this\nattack? And of course, establishing the initial entry point. The U.S. government has speculated that the attackers\nbehind this attack are Russia state-sponsored actors, but definitive evidence of this assertion has not yet been\npublished.\n\nThis attack has also thrown into sharp focus the extent to which many businesses - from the small to the very large\n\n- rely heavily on cloud services, and the complications that can create when it comes to keeping your network safe.\n\nSymantec has published multiple blogs and podcasts about this attack, which can be accessed in the\nFurther Reading section at the end of this paper. Our investigations into this attack are also continuing, with the\nsafety of our customers’ networks always our primary concern.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Other High-Profile Supply Chain Attacks**\n\n**NotPetya**\n\n[The NotPetya attack occurred in 2017 and is one of the most high-profile software supply chain attacks of recent](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/petya-ransomware-wiper)\ntimes. NotPetya ended up compromising thousands of computers around the world and causing billions of dollars\nin damage. M.E.Doc, a tax and accounting software widely and primarily used in Ukraine, was identified as the\ninitial insertion point of NotPetya into corporate networks. Analysis of the attack revealed that the attackers used\nstolen credentials to modify the configuration of the M.E.Doc web server, allowing them to redirect any request\nfor updates to a malicious server under their control. This is how they downloaded the NotPetya malware onto\ncompromised computers.\n\nThe impact of NotPetya may not have been as severe had it not been for the fact the EternalBlue and\nEternalRomance exploits were incorporated into the threat as one of its means to propagate itself. These exploits\nallow for self-propagation, meaning that NotPetya was able to spread widely, and beyond the initially targeted\ndevices and networks. The targeting of M.E.Doc to carry out the supply chain attack, which is primarily used in\nUkraine, indicates that the targets of NotPetya were probably based in that country. However, its ability to selfpropagate meant that it ultimately spread to many other countries, including the U.S., Russia, and many countries in\nEurope, and led to widespread disruption.\n\n**CCleaner**\n\n[The CCleaner compromise also occurred in 2017, and underlined the indiscriminate nature of software supply chain](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-hid-malware-in-ccleaner-pc-tool-for-nearly-a-month/)\nattacks. It’s estimated that more than 2.2 million computers installed the Trojanized software update, but secondary\nactivity was only observed on as few as 40 machines. The compromised version of the software would transmit\nthe infected computer’s name, IP address, a list of installed software, a list of active software, and list of network\nadapters to a third-party server located in the U.S. It appears that once the attackers received this information they\nthen decided whether or not to launch second-stage malware.\n\nThe small number of computers that received the second-stage malware indicates that the attackers were only\ninterested in a small subset of CCleaner’s users. However, this attack does underline that supply chain attackers are\nquite happy to infect as many devices and networks as necessary to get them to their desired target(s).\n\n**ASUS**\n\n[A similar attack to CCleaner occurred in 2018, when it was revealed that tech giant ASUS’s automated software](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/asus-supply-chain-attack)\n[update system had been hijacked to deliver malware. As many as half a million devices were affected in this supply](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/asus-supply-chain-attack)\nchain attack, with the attackers seeking to target users who were identified by their network adapters’ MAC\naddresses. The list of MAC addresses was hardcoded into the Trojanized samples and used to identify the intended\ntargets of the hack.\n\nThis supply chain attack started in June 2018 and continued through to at least late October that year. The\nTrojanized updates contained a form of backdoor program that attempted to connect to an attacker-controlled\ndomain. The updates were signed with legitimate ASUS digital certificates, which helped the attack go undetected\nfor a significant period of time.\n\nThese examples show that large companies need to be aware of software supply chain attacks not only because\ntheir third-party suppliers could be targeted as a means to get onto their systems, but because they too could be\ntargeted to gain access to the systems of their customers.\n\n#### Why are Supply Chain Attacks Increasingly Popular?\n\nSupply chain attacks have increased in prevalence over the last few years. Back in 2015 and 2016 there were just\na handful of supply chain attacks – we detailed in the ISTR in 2018 that there were approximately four publicly\nreported supply chain attacks in both those years. This increased in 2017 when there were approximately 13 supply\nchain attacks reported, while a jump occurred in 2018 and 2019, driven primarily by the popularity of formjacking.\n\n\n-----\n\nFormjacking criminals didn’t appear to be leveraging supply chain attacks as frequently in 2020 as they had been in\nprevious years. In 2020, there were approximately 21 publicly reported supply chain attacks. As the SolarWinds and\nCCleaner attacks demonstrate, just one supply chain attack can lead to thousands or even millions of compromised\nmachines. Many of these attacks were sophisticated and appear to have been carried out by experienced cyber\ncriminals or nation state groups. They include the SolarWinds hack, as well as attacks by advanced persistent threat\ngroup Cicada (aka APT10).\n\nSupply chain attacks show how ever-changing the cyber security landscape is and the importance of staying up\nto date with what is occurring on the cyber crime landscape. Software supply chain attacks increased more than\nfivefold between 2016 and 2020, going from being a relatively niche issue, to a problem that organizations of all\nsizes need to be alert to and aware of.\n\nFigure 2. Supply Chain Attacks Increased Fivefold in the Space of a Few Years\n\n25\n\n**21**\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5 **4**\n\n0\n\n**2016** **2020**\n\nSo, why have supply chain attacks soared in popularity among both cyber criminals and nation state actors?\n\nMalicious actors may leverage supply chain attacks for a variety of reasons:\n\n  - Supply chain attacks are often used to infiltrate well-protected organizations where other infection vectors\nmay have failed. Attackers find the weakest link in the organization’s supply chain.\n\n  - These types of attacks can allow for fast distribution of malicious software, with a large number of machines\ninfected in a short period of time. The number of infections can grow quickly as users update their software,\nand especially if automatic updates are enabled.\n\n  - Supply chain attacks can allow for the targeting of specific regions or industries, by Trojanizing a software\nthat is used by a specific sector or region. The NotPetya attacks were an example of this, with 96% of\nmachines affected by the initial Trojanized software update being in Ukraine.\n\n  - These attacks can allow for the infiltration of air-gapped networks. Sysadmins may copy the software\nupdate to the isolated network or install it from a removable drive. If the software itself is Trojanized then the\nmalicious actors can gain access to the separated network.\n\n  - It can be difficult for victims to identify where their system was compromised as the attacks emanate\nfrom trusted processes. This can help attackers conceal their identity and make it more difficult for teams\ninvestigating the incident.\n\n  - Depending on the software that they Trojanize, the attack may automatically provide an attacker with\nelevated privileges on the target system. The attackers are able to achieve all this without deploying any\nsophisticated or noisy malware or exploits.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attackers who carry out supply chain attacks – particularly those who hijack third parties to compromise\nsoftware updates – are generally sophisticated actors. They require the skills to first compromise the third-party\nsupplier, which may be considered the “weakest link” in a large company’s supply chain, but this doesn’t mean\ncompromising them is easy. To make their attack as convincing as possible attackers will also need to procure or\nfake a digital certificate. But the appeal of supply chain attacks for attackers is also clear – well-executed supply\nchain attacks are difficult to stop and hard to detect, until it may be too late.\n\n#### Case Study: Probable Lazarus Attack Leverages South Korean Software\n\n### Case Study: Probable Lazarus Attack Leverages South Korean Software\n\n\n[In November 2020, ESET published a report](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/11/16/lazarus-supply-chain-attack-south-korea/)\ndetailing a supply chain attack campaign aimed\nat victims in South Korea. This campaign abused\nthe legitimate WIZVERA VeraPort software to\ndeliver malware to victim organizations. WIZVERA\nVeraPort is a software that is legitimately used\nin South Korea to install security software. ESET\nattributed this activity to the North Korean APT\ngroup Lazarus. Symantec’s initial investigation\ninto this activity uncovered activity consistent\nwith that reported by ESET, but Symantec has not\nattributed this activity to any named group.\n\nSymantec’s telemetry showed at least one victim\nin South Korea in the heavy industry sector that\nwas infected with malware as a result of running\nWIZVERA VeraPort software. ESET had not\nspecified the sector of any of the targets it saw\ninfected. It is unclear which website the victim\nmachine was visiting that required VeraPort, but\nthe signed downloader was delivered from a\ncompromised website related to the rail transport\nsector. The attackers quickly moved laterally in\nthe infected organization, utilizing a large variety\nof tools, including dual-use, hacking tools and\nmalware, and ultimately deploying file-uploading\ntools in an attempt to exfiltrate data, including\nOutlook mail archives and video. Information\nabout this post-compromise activity has not\npreviously been publicly reported.\n\n\n**Activity Summary**\n\nThe signed initial downloader was downloaded\nfrom a compromised website and launched by\nVeraPort.\n\nSymantec then observed various malware and\na large variety of hacking tools being deployed\non the infected network. These were used to\nmove laterally through the infected network and\neventually to attempt to exfiltrate data from\ninfected machines. The attackers made extensive\nuse of living-off-the-land tactics and off-the-shelf\nhacking tools.\n\nTable 1. Malware and Hacking Tools Used by the Attackers\n\nMalware Hacking Tools\n\nDropper Remote command utility that uses WMI\n\nDLL Service\nOpen-source proxy tool\nCreator\n\nPentesting tool used for man-in-theLoader\nmiddle (MitM) attacks\n\nFile enumeration too ‘everything[.]exe’\n\nActive directory tool ‘adfind.exe’\n\nPowerShell was also used to download multiple\nexecutables. The command line tool Curl was\nused to download ‘GIF’ files that were then\ndecoded as executable files using Certutil. Two\nfile uploaders were eventually deployed and used\nto exfiltrate AVI video files, PST files (an Outlook\narchive format), and a .DAT file. At least one of the\ninfected machines had Autodesk installed on it,\nindicating it may be used in engineering or design.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Targeted Attack Groups Leverage Supply Chain Attacks\n\nSupply chain attacks are frequently used by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, like Lazarus and others.\n\n**Orangeworm/Kwampirs**\n\n[We first wrote about this threat in 2018, when we revealed a group we called Orangeworm was using the Kwampirs](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/orangeworm-targets-healthcare-us-europe-asia)\nmalware to target the healthcare sector via supply chain attacks.\n\nAt the time, Orangeworm had victims in a variety of sectors, including manufacturing, information technology,\nagriculture, and logistics. However, all the victims in these sectors had links to healthcare, so appear to have been\ntargeted as part of supply chain attacks to achieve the ultimate goal of compromising healthcare victims.\n\nKwampirs is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that provides the attackers with backdoor access to the affected\nmachine. The malware spreads through an infected network via network shares.\n\n[It appears the threat is still active, since in 2020 the FBI released an alert three times warning that malicious actors](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-re-sends-alert-about-supply-chain-attacks-for-the-third-time-in-three-months/)\nwere leveraging Kwampirs to carry out supply chain attacks. The healthcare sector was highlighted as being of\nparticular interest to them. The FBI first released this warning in January 2020, and then issued it again in February\nand March, as the COVID-19 crisis ramped up and put pressure on the healthcare sector worldwide.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Chinese APT Groups Leverage Various Means to Carry Out Supply Chain Attacks**\n\n[A group of seven men were indicted by the U.S. Justice Department in September 2020 for their alleged](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/09/chinese-antivirus-firm-was-part-of-apt41-supply-chain-attack/)\ninvolvement in hacking more than 100 high-tech and online gaming companies over many years. The Justice\nDepartment said the men were part of a targeted attack group called APT41 (aka Winnti), which is believed to have\n[links to the Chinese government. Symantec tracks APT41 as two separate groups – Blackfly and Grayfly – with two](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/apt41-indictments-china-espionage)\nof the men named in the indictments appearing to have worked with both groups.\n\nThe indictment states that APT41 used phishing emails to target its victims, but the group was also known to\nleverage supply chain attacks by hacking a software company and modifying its code to gain access to its\ncustomers’ machines. The group also allegedly created security software and PC utilities that they advertised as\nbeing legitimate.\n\nFive of those named in the indictment are resident in China and remain at large, but the Justice Department\nstated in the indictment that it had been able to seize websites, domains, and servers associated with the group’s\noperations and shut them down, hindering their operations. However, as most of the individuals involved have not\nbeen arrested, these indictments are unlikely to fully stop Grayfly/Blackfly activity.\n\n[Also in 2020, we observed an attack campaign by another China-linked group – which we call Cicada, but which is](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-japan-espionage)\n[also known as APT10. Cicada has been publicly linked by authorities in the U.S. to the Chinese government. In the](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\ncampaign we reported on in 2020, Cicada was seen targeting Japan-linked organizations in a number of sectors,\nincluding the automotive, pharmaceutical, and engineering sectors. We did not see the group Trojanizing software\nor leveraging Trojanized software as an entry point to targeted organizations, however, we did see managed service\nproviders (MSPs) among the group’s targets. Cicada has a history of targeting MSPs, we assume with the aim of\ngaining access to their customers’ networks. The group was also seen targeting a number of companies involved in\nsupplying parts to the automotive industry, as well as targeting automotive companies themselves. These suppliers\nmay have been targeted as a means of gaining a foothold on the networks of their automotive customers.\n\n**Attack Groups Targeting the Middle East Leverage the Software Supply Chain**\n\n[We wrote about Tortoiseshell in September 2019, when we spotted it targeting IT providers in Saudi Arabia, in what](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/tortoiseshell-apt-supply-chain)\nappeared to be supply chain attacks aimed at ultimately gaining access to the IT providers’ customers. Around 11\norganizations were compromised in that campaign.\n\nElfin (aka APT33), a group we published about in March 2019, also had a focus on organizations in Saudi Arabia. In\n[the campaign we investigated we also saw the group targeting victims in the U.S., but said at the time that these](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage)\norganizations may have been targeted as part of supply chain attacks in an attempt to gain access to organizations\nin the Middle East. In one instance, a large U.S. company was attacked the same month that a Middle Eastern\ncompany it co-owned was also attacked.\n\n[There were reports in January 2020 that Elfin was increasingly targeting the suppliers and manufacturers of](https://www.controlrisks.com/our-thinking/insights/iranian-cyber-espionage-group-targets-suppliers-of-industrial-control-systems)\nindustrial control systems (ICS) used in electrical utilities, manufacturing, and oil refineries. Indications are that\nthese may have been supply chain attacks aimed at establishing a presence on the suppliers’ customers.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Why You Need To Be Aware of Supply Chain Attacks – and How to Protect Yourself\n\nSupply chain attacks are generally leveraged by skilled malicious actors in targeted intrusions. Organizations need\nto be aware of these kinds of attacks as they could be targeted for the initial intrusion, or following on from the\nsuccessful compromise of one of their third-party suppliers.\n\nIt can be complex to detect and stop a supply chain attack targeted at your business. As we have said, the malware\nis often delivered to your network via a trusted process and from a trusted vendor, often even with a valid digital\ncertificate, making spotting the malicious activity difficult until it is too late.\n\nHowever, while supply chain attacks are difficult to prevent, there are some steps that can be taken including:\n\n   - Testing new updates in small test environments or sandboxes first to detect any suspicious behavior.\nHowever, when doing this bear in mind that sophisticated attackers can apply well-known tricks to delay\nmalicious behavior in order to not attract attention during this kind of analysis.\n\n   - Behavior monitoring of all activity on a system can help identify any unwanted patterns and allow you to\nblock a suspicious application before any damage can be done. This is possible as the behavior of a malicious\nupdate will be different to that of the expected clean software.\n\n  - The producers of software packages should also ensure that they are able to detect unwanted changes in the\nsoftware update process and on their website.\n\n  - Organizations should reduce the attack surface by implementing Zero Trust policies and network\nsegmentation, so that if a malicious update is downloaded onto one machine it won’t be able to automatically\nspread to the whole network.\n\nAn interesting potential trend to note too, as mentioned in the SolarWinds section of this paper, is the possibility\nthat some supply chain attacks could be multi-stage. For example, attackers are compromising Company 1, gaining\naccess to Company 2’s network, but their actual targets are Company 2’s customers (Company 3, 4, 5) etc.\n\nMulti-stage supply chain attacks would be a complex undertaking, and would likely only be attempted by highly\nskilled actors, such as those behind the SolarWinds attack. They would require maintaining a low profile on multiple\nnetworks before even gaining access to the targeted network(s). Only sophisticated actors would likely have the\nskills to carry out these kinds of attacks successfully, and they would need to be highly targeted for them to be\nworthwhile for the attackers.\n\nAs such, multi-stage software supply chain attacks are likely to only ever be a rare occurrence, but if carried out\nsuccessfully could grant attackers access to highly protected networks that could not be compromised by any\nother means. Attackers capable of successfully executing such an attack would be highly skilled, meaning they\nwould pose a significant danger to the operations of any organization they would compromise.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe attackers carrying out supply chain attacks, like those behind the SolarWinds hack, are sophisticated and\nhighly skilled actors who pose a significant threat to any organization they compromise. These attacks are also\ndifficult to guard against, as the malware generally makes its way onto targeted networks by abusing trusted\nprocesses and relationships. This means that these attacks often aren’t detected until a second-stage malware\nis deployed, at which point the damage may already be done, as attackers have potentially already been on the\nsystem for a long time.\n\nOne important step organizations can take is to do an audit of their third-party suppliers and who has access to\ntheir network. They should minimize access as much as possible, giving only the minimum amount of access and\npermissions required to third parties. They should also ensure they carry out due diligence with any companies\nthey work with or which supply them with software or support services, to ensure these companies have sufficient\nprotocols and protections in place. However, as the SolarWinds hack demonstrated, this isn’t always a guarantee\nthat your organization is protected as even well-established companies like Microsoft and security firms can fall\nvictim to supply chain attacks. It is for that reason that further steps like network segmentation and Zero Trust\npolicies are also important.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### How Symantec Solutions Can Help\n\n## How Symantec Solutions Can Help\n\nThe Symantec Enterprise Business provides a comprehensive portfolio of security solutions to address\ntoday’s security challenges and protect data and digital infrastructure from multifaceted threats.\nThese solutions include core capabilities designed to help organizations prevent and detect\nadvanced attacks, including supply chain attacks.\n\n\n**Symantec Endpoint Security Complete**\n\nSymantec Endpoint Security Complete (SESC) was specifically created to help protect against LEARN MORE\nadvanced attacks.
