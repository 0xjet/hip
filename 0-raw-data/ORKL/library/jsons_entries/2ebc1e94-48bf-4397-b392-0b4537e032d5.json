We can tie this malware to the Iron Group, a\nthreat actor group known for ransomware attacks in the past.\n\nXbash has ransomware and coinmining capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt also has self-propagating capabilities (meaning it has worm-like characteristics similar to\nWannaCry or Petya/NotPetya). It also has capabilities not currently implemented that, when\nimplemented, could enable it to spread very quickly within an organizations’ network (again,\nmuch like WannaCry or Petya/NotPetya).\n\nXbash spreads by attacking weak passwords and unpatched vulnerabilities.\n\nXbash is data-destructive; destroying Linux-based databases as part of its ransomware\ncapabilities. We can also find NO functionality within Xbash that would enable restoration\nafter the ransom is paid.\n\nThis means that, like NotPetya, Xbash is data destructive malware posing at ransomware.\n\nOrganizations can protect themselves against Xbash by:\n\n1. Using strong, non-default passwords\n2. Keeping up-to-date on security updates\n3. Implementing endpoint security on Microsoft Windows AND Linux systems\n4. Preventing access to unknown hosts on the internet (to prevent access to command\n\nand control servers)\n5. Implementing and maintaining rigorous and effective backup and restoration processes\n\nand procedures.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected against this threat as outlined at the end of this\nblog.\n\nBelow are some more specifics on Xbash’s capabilities:\n\nIt combines botnet, coinmining, ransomware and self-propagation.\nIt targets Linux-based for its ransomware and botnet capabilities.\nIt targets Microsoft Windows-based systems for its coinmining and self-propagating\ncapabilities.\nThe ransomware component targets and deletes Linux-based databases.\nTo date, we have observed 48 incoming transactions to these wallets with total income\nof about 0.964 bitcoins meaning 48 victims have paid about US$6,000 total (at the time\nof this writing).\nHowever, as see no evidence that the paid ransoms have resulted in recovery for the\nvictims.\nIn fact, we can find no evidence of any functionality that makes recovery possible\nthrough ransom payment.\n[Our analysis shows this is likely the work of the Iron group, a group publicly linked to](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/73211/malware/iron-cybercrime-group-hackingteam.html)\nother ransomware campaigns including those that use the Remote Control System\n[(RCS), whose source code was believed to be stolen from the HackingTeam in 2015.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking_Team#2015_data_breach)\n\n**Research:**\n\n\n-----\n\nRecently Unit 42 used WildFire to identify a new malware family targeting Linux servers.\nAfter further investigation we realized it’s a combination of botnet and ransomware that\n[developed by an active cybercrime group Iron (aka](https://www.intezer.com/iron-cybercrime-group-under-the-scope-2/) [Rocke) in this year. We have named this](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/08/rocke-champion-of-monero-miners.html)\nnew malware “Xbash”, based on the name of the malicious code’s original main module.\n\nPreviously the Iron group developed and spread cryptocurrency miners or cryptocurrency\ntransaction hijacking trojans mainly for Microsoft Windows and only a few for Linux. Instead,\nXbash aimed on discovering unprotected services, deleting victim’s MySQL, PostgreSQL\nand MongoDB databases, and ransom for Bitcoins. Xbash uses three known vulnerabilities\nin Hadoop, Redis and ActiveMQ for self-propagation or infecting Windows system.\n\nOther new technical characteristics in Xbash that are worth noting:\n\n**Developed in** **[Python: Xbash was developed using Python and then converted into](https://www.python.org/)**\n[self-contained Linux ELF executables by abusing the legitimate tool PyInstaller for](http://www.pyinstaller.org/)\ndistribution.\n**[Targets IP addresses and Domain Names: Modern Linux malware such as Mirai or](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/Mirai/)**\n[Gafgyt usually generate random IP addresses as scanning destinations. By contrast,](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/Gafgyt/)\nXbash fetches from its C2 servers both IP addresses and domain names for service\nprobing and exploiting.\n**[Targets Windows and Linux: When exploiting vulnerable Redis service, Xbash will](https://redis.io/)**\nalso figure out whether the service is running on Windows or not. If so, it will send\nmalicious JavaScript or VBScript payload for downloading and executing a coinminer\nfor Windows.\n**Intranet Scanning Functionality: The Xbash authors have developed the new**\ncapability of scanning for vulnerable servers within enterprise intranet. We see this\nfunctionality in the samples but, interestingly, it has not been enabled that we can see.\n\nWe have discovered four different versions of Xbash so far. Code and timestamp differences\namong these versions show that it’s still under active development. The botnet began to\noperate since as early as May 2018. Thus far, we’ve observed 48 incoming transactions to\nthe Bitcoin wallet addresses used by the malware, which may indicate 48 victims of its\nransom behavior.\n\nIn the rest of this blog, we will introduce more technical details of these behaviors, and\nintroduce how Palo Alto Networks products prevent the threat.\n\nTechnical Details\n\n**From Python Code to Native Executable**\n\nIn [a previous blog from 2016, Unit 42 revealed a Windows malware being developed by](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/04/unit42-python-based-pwobot-targets-european-organizations/)\nPython and being converted to PE executable by PyInstaller. All four versions of Xbash that\nwe discovered also used this technique. Based on this, we believe the malware authors gain\nmany benefits:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Faster Development: Developing in Python can be easier and faster than in C, C++ or\n\nGo: therefore it can enable faster, iterative development which enables the malware’s\nfaster evolution (and can enable faster counter-counter-measures as well).\n2. Easy, Assured Installation: PyInstaller creates self-contained native executables\n\nwhich include all necessary dependencies including Python runtime, libraries,user and\nthird-party libraries. Given the diversity of Linux installations and environments, the\nattackers cannot be sure that Python-based malware would install and run successfully.\nBy packaging in a self-contained native executable like this, ensures that the malware\nwill successfully install on the target systems.\n3. Anti-Detection Capabilities: PyInstaller’s code compilation, code\n\ncompression/conversion, and optional code encryption together work to obfuscate the\nindicators of malicious behavior. This obfuscation helps the malware to defeat detection\nby antivirus/antimalware engines or static analysis. At the time of this writing, we\nobserved a 1/57 detection rate for Xbash in VirusTotal as shown in Figure 1.\n4. Cross-Platform Malware: PyInstaller supports creating binaries for Windows, Apple\n\nmacOS and Linux from the same Python code: this enables the malware to be truly\ncross-platform (though at the time of this writing we have not found any Windows or\nmacOS versions of Xbash).\n\n_Figure 1 Detection Rate of Xbash as shown on VirusTotal_\n\nThrough manual reverse engineering, we were able to extract the main malicious Python\nmodules from the Xbash executables and decompile them successfully. Therefore, in the\nlater sections of this analysis, we show the Python source code.\n\nC2 Communication\n\nXbash hard-coded a bunch of domain names as its C2 servers. It also fetches a webpage\nhosted on Pastebin (listed in the IOCs) to update the C2 domain list. Some of these C2\n[domains are reused from previous Windows coinminers attributed to Iron cybercrime group.](https://4hou.win/wordpress/?p=20588)\n\nAll C2 communications were based on HTTP protocol. We found three kinds of C2 traffic:\n\n1. One for fetching a list of IP addresses or domains for scanning\n2. One for fetching a list of weak passwords, in addition of using hard-coded passwords\n\n\n-----\n\n3. One for reporting scan results\n\nThree types of URIs were used to fetch scanning targets:\n\n1. /domain/phpmyadmin or /domain/all: to get a list of domains for scanning of vulnerable\n\nor unprotected web services such as phpMyAdmin.\n2. /port/tcp8080, /port/udp1900, etc.: to get a list of IP addresses for scanning of their\n\nspecific TCP or UDP port\n3. /cidir, to get a list of CIDR of IP addresses for popular ports/services scanning.\n\nThrough a still alive C2 domain, we were able to get 1,000 domains, 1,000 IP addresses, or\na /22 CIDR per request, respectively as shown in Figure 2. We found that different requests\nwill return different results, showing that the C2 servers were dynamic dispatching tasks to\ndifferent bots. We randomly chose some domains and didn’t find any specific region or\nindustry targeted. And, the targeted domains are not in the Alexa top one million domains\nlist.\n\n_Figure 2 Xbash fetched domains from C2 server for further scanning_\n\nPopular Linux botnets such as Mirai and Gafgyt usually only scan IP addresses. Xbash\nrepresents a next-stage evolution of Linux botnets by extending the targets to public\nwebsites by targeting domains as well as IP address. This also makes deploying a honeypot\n\n\n-----\n\nto observe Xbash challenging since honeypots are usually deployed with IP addresses only.\nWhile it may not be an intentional step, the inclusion of domain targeting has an anti-analysis\nbenefit for the attackers.\n\nBesides of fetching a list of scanning targets, Xbash will also request C2 server via URI “/p”\nto fetch a list of weak passwords for brute forcing.\n\nAfter Xbash has scanned a target and successfully found specific opening ports, weak\ncredentials or exploitable, unpatched vulnerability, it will report the result to a random C2\nserver via HTTP POST to URI “/c”.\n\n**Service Probing and Brute Forcing**\n\nIf the scanning target is an IP address, Xbash will try to scan many TCP or UDP ports. Here\nare part of services they’re probing and the ports used:\n\nHTTP: 80, 8080, 8888, 8000, 8001, 8088\nVNC: 5900, 5901, 5902, 5903\nMySQL: 3306\nMemcached: 11211\nMySQL/MariaDB: 3309, 3308,3360 3306, 3307, 9806, 1433\nFTP: 21\nTelnet: 23, 2323\nPostgreSQL: 5432\nRedis: 6379, 2379\nElasticSearch: 9200\nMongoDB: 27017\nRDP: 3389\nUPnP/SSDP: 1900\nNTP: 123\nDNS: 53\nSNMP: 161\nLDAP: 389\nRexec: 512\nRlogin: 513\nRsh: 514\nRsync: 873\nOracle database: 1521\nCouchDB: 5984\n\nFor some services, such as VNC, Rsync, MySQL, MariaDB, Memcached, PostgreSQL,\nMongoDB, and phpMyAdmin, if a related port is open, it will use a built-in weak\nusername/password dictionary and try to login into the service as shown in Figure 3. The\n\n\n-----\n\ndictionary also contains common or default passwords for services like Telnet, FTP, and\nRedis.\n\n_Figure 3 Xbash tries to brute force services such as Rsync_\n\n## Delete Databases and Ransom\n\nIf Xbash successfully login into a service including MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, it\nwill delete almost all existing databases in the server (except for some databases that stored\nuser login information), create a new database named “PLEASE_READ_ME_XYZ”, and\nleave a ransom message into table “WARNING” of the new database, as shown in Figure 4\nand Figure 5.\n\nSend 0.02 BTC to this address and contact this email with your website or your ip or\ndb_name of your server to recover your database! Your DB is Backed up to our servers!If we\nnot received your payment,we will leak your database\n\n1jqpmcLygJdH8fN7BCk2cwwNBRWqMZqL1\n\nbackupsql@pm.me\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Xbash create ransom message into MySQL database via phpMyAdmin_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 New database, table and ransome message created by Xbash_\n\nIf Xbash logged into a phpMyAdmin service, it will do exactly the same operations as above\nto those databases too, via sending HTTP requests to phpMyAdmin. This is because the\nphpMyAdmin service is usually managing some MySQL databases.\n\nIt’s important to note that, the database name, table name, table schema, and the ransom\n[message used by Xbash are almost identical with some incidents within multiple waves of](https://www.guardicore.com/2017/02/0-2-btc-strikes-back-now-attacking-mysql-databases/)\nransom attacks to MySQL, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Hadoop, CouchDB, Cassandra, Redis,\nAWS S3, etc. at 2016 and 2017, which have compromised over 56,685 servers in the globe\n[by report. The only changes in Xbash are:](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/massive-wave-of-mongodb-ransom-attacks-makes-26-000-new-victims/)\n\nDatabase name changed from PLEASE_READ_ME to PLEASE_README_XYZ\nBitcoins they’re asking for reduced from 0.2 BTC or 0.15 BTC to0.02 BTC\nBitcoin wallet address and email address changed\nThis time a blackmail phrase was added into the message: “If we not received your\npayment,we will leak your database”\n\n\n-----\n\nThus far, we have observed three different bitcoin wallet addresses hard-coded in the Xbash\nsamples. Since May 2018, there are 48 incoming transactions to these wallets with total\nincome of about 0.964 bitcoins (about US$6,000 at the time of this writing). Figure 5 shows\none of the wallets. Also, note that the funds are being withdrawn, showing us that the\nattackers are actively collecting their ransom.\n\n_Figure 6 Incoming transactions to one of bitcoin wallets_\n\nHowever, as is so often the case, we see no evidence that the attackers are actually making\ngood on their “promise” and helping the victims restore their deleted databases. In fact,\ncontrary to the ransom note, we found NO evidence of code in Xbash that backs up the\ndeleted databases at all.\n\n\n-----\n\nExploit for Propagation\n\nWhen Xbash finds a destination has Hadoop, Redis or ActiveMQ running, it will also attempt\nto exploit the service for self-propagation. Three known vulnerabilities are targeted:\n\n[1. Hadoop YARN ResourceManager unauthenticated command execution, which was first](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/linux/http/hadoop_unauth_exec.rb)\n\ndisclosed in October 2016 and has no CVE number assigned.\n[2. Redis arbitrary file write and remote command execution, which was first disclosed in](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/134200/Redis-Remote-Command-Execution.html)\n\nOctober 2015 and has no CVE number assigned. This is shown below in Figure 6.\n[3. ActiveMQ arbitrary file write vulnerability, CVE-2016-3088.](http://activemq.apache.org/security-advisories.data/CVE-2016-3088-announcement.txt)\n\n_Figure 7 Xbash exploiting Redis vulnerability_\n\nWhen the exploit succeeds, Xbash will either directly execute a shell command to download\nand to run malicious Shell or Python scripts, or create new cron job to do the same, again as\nshown in Figure 6. The malicious scripts were downloaded from the same C2 servers as\nXbash used. In either instance, their main functions are to kill other popular Coinminers,\ndownload Coinminers developed by the Iron cybercrime group, and download Xbash itself\nonto the target system for further propagation.\n\nThe net of this is that Xbash targets and uses vulnerable Hadoop, Redis or ActiveMQ\nsystems both to run the attackers’ coinminer AND propagate Xbash within the environment.\n\nInfecting Windows Servers\n\nAnother notable feature of Xbash is the way it uses Redis and an HTTP service to determine\nif the vulnerable Redis service is installed on Linux or Microsoft Windows. If the destination\nbeing scanned has both vulnerable Redis service and a HTTP service running, Xbash will try\nto use information leaked by the Redis vulnerability to guess HTTP web server’s installation\nlocation. Xbash then uses the location to guess which operating system (Linux or Windows)\nthe destination is running as shown in Figure 7.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 Web server paths Xbash used to determine operating system_\n\nIf it believes it’s found a Windows server, Xbash will exploit the Redis vulnerability to create a\nWindows startup item (as shown in Figure 6), instead of a Linux cronjob. Depends on\nXbash’s version, this new startup item will download a malicious HTML or a Scriptlet file from\nXbash’s C2 server, and to execute the JavaScript or VBScript code in the file via “mshta” or\nvia “regsvr32”. These scripts will then invoke PowerShell to download a malicious PE\nexecutable or PE DLL file from the same C2 server for execution as shown in Figure 8.\n\n_Figure 8 Malicious JavaScript code to be executed in vulnerable Windows server (with_\n_comments)_\n\nThrough our investigation we found that these malicious PE files were coinminer or\nransomware developed by the Iron cybercrime group as shown in Figure 9.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 AutoFocus associated the malicious PE file with Iron cybercrime group_\n\nTargeting Enterprise Intranet\n\nIn all versions of Xbash we found, there is a Python class named “LanScan”. Its functions are\nto get local intranet information, generate a list of all IP addresses within the same subnet,\nand to perform port scanning to all these IPs as shown in figure 10. It appears that during its\nevolution, the author was adding more ports to this piece of code. However, the code was\ninert and unutilized: it is still standalone and yet to be connected with the main part of the\ncode. We believe the author may enable this functionality in coming versions.\n\n_Figure 10 Generate list of IP addresses in victim’s subnet and perform port scanning_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn an enterprise network (including office network and datacenter or private cloud), there are\nusually more servers providing services internally than to public. And these services are also\nmore likely unprotected or configured with weak password. The chance of find vulnerable\nservices within Intranet is much higher than over Internet. We believe that is the main\nmotivation of Xbash’s Intranet scanning code. If events like WannaCry and NotPetya are\nany guide, this intranet functionality could make Xbash even more devastating once it’s\nenabled.\n\nConclusions\n\nXbash is a novel and complex Linux malware and the newest work of an active cybercrime\ngroup. From its characteristics and behaviors, we could realize many trends in current\nIoT/Linux security battleground:\n\nAttackers are expanding their profit-making ways from mining cryptocurrency to\nhijacking or ransom for cryptocurrency\nAttackers are expanding territory by scanning domain names and by attacking\nenterprise Intranet\nAttackers are looking for more potential victims by gathering more and more\nvulnerabilities from everywhere, no matter whether the vulnerability is new or old, and\nno matter whether it’s famous or not (a CVE number was assigned or not)\nAttackers are to toward cross-platform attacks and quick evolution\nDifferent types of script files are important actors between exploiting and malware\nexecution\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat:\n\nWildFire detected Xbash for Linux as well as the dropped CoinMiner for Windows\nELF and PE format malware’s signatures have been released via Antivirus\nAll involved malicious domains have been covered by PAN-DB URL Filtering\nAll three vulnerabilities exploit by Xbash have been covered by Threat Prevention\n(39786, 39787, 54654, 54655)\nXbash C2 traffic have been covered by Threat Prevention too (18474, 18475, 18476)\n[An AutoFocus tag has been created for tracking this attack.](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Xbash)\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\n**Samples for Linux**\n\n7a18c7bdf0c504832c8552766dcfe0ba33dd5493daa3d9dbe9c985c1ce36e5aa zlibx\n\n0b9c54692d25f68ede1de47d4206ec3cd2e5836e368794eccb3daa632334c641 Xbash\n\ndbc380cbfb1536dfb24ef460ce18bccdae549b4585ba713b5228c23924385e54 xapache\n\n\n-----\n\n5b790f02bdb26b6b6b270a5669311b4f231d17872aafb237b7e87b6bbb57426d libhttpd\n\ne59be6eec9629d376a8a4a70fe9f8f3eec7b0919019f819d44b9bdd1c429277c XbashX\n\nf808a42b10cf55603389945a549ce45edc6a04562196d14f7489af04688f12bc XbashY\n\ndcd37e5b266cc0cd3fab73caa63b218f5b92e9bd5b25cf1cacf1afdb0d8e76ff rootv2.sh\n\nde63ce4a42f06a5903b9daa62b67fcfbdeca05beb574f966370a6ae7fd21190d lowerv2.sh\n\n09968c4573580398b3269577ced28090eae4a7c326c1a0ec546761c623625885 rootv2.sh\n\na27acc07844bb751ac33f5df569fd949d8b61dba26eb5447482d90243fc739af r88.sh\n\n**Samples for Windows**\n\nf888dda9ca1876eba12ffb55a7a993bd1f5a622a30045a675da4955ede3e4cb8 tt.txt\n\n31155bf8c85c6c6193842b8d09bda88990d710db9f70efe85c421f1484f0ee78 tg.jpg\n\n725efd0f5310763bc5375e7b72dbb2e883ad90ec32d6177c578a1c04c1b62054 reg9.sct\n\nd7fbd2a4db44d86b4cf5fa4202203dacfefd6ffca6a0615dca5bc2a200ad56b6 m.png\n\nece3cfdb75aaabc570bf38af6f4653f73101c1641ce78a4bb146e62d9ac0cd50 tmp.jpg\n\n**Downloading URLs**\n\nhxxp://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m[.]tk/zlibx\n\nhxxp://e3sas6tzvehwgpak[.]tk/XbashY\n\nhxxp://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m[.]tk/XbashY\n\nhxxp://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m[.]tk/xapache\n\nhxxp://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m[.]tk/libhttpd\n\nhxxp://xmr.enjoytopic[.]tk/l/rootv2.sh\n\nhxxp://xmr.enjoytopic[.]tk/l2/rootv2.sh\n\nhxxp://xmr.enjoytopic[.]tk/l/r88.sh\n\nhxxp://xmr.enjoytopic[.]tk/12/r88.sh\n\nhxxp://e3sas6tzvehwgpak[.]tk/lowerv2.sh\n\nhxxp://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m[.]tk/r88.sh\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp://e3sas6tzvehwgpak[.]tk/XbashY\n\nhxxp://e3sas6tzvehwgpak[.]tk/XbashX\n\nhxxp://png.realtimenews[.]tk/m.png\n\nhxxp://daknobcq4zal6vbm[.]tk/tt.txt\n\nhxxp://d3goboxon32grk2l[.]tk/reg9.sct\n\n**Domains for C2 Communication**\n\nejectrift.censys[.]xyz\n\nscan.censys[.]xyz\n\napi.leakingprivacy[.]tk\n\nnews.realnewstime[.]xyz\n\nscan.realnewstime[.]xyz\n\nnews.realtimenews[.]tk\n\nscanaan[.]tk\n\nscan.3g2upl4pq6kufc4m[.]tk\n\nscan.vfk2k5s5tfjr27tz[.]tk\n\nscan.blockbitcoin[.]tk\n\nblockbitcoin[.]com\n\n**IPs for C2 Communication**\n\n142.44.215[.]177\n\n144.217.61[.]147\n\n**URLs for C2 Domain Updating**\n\nhxxps://pastebin[.]com/raw/Xu74Mzif\n\nhxxps://pastebin[.]com/raw/rBHjTZY6\n\n**Bitcoin Wallet Addresses in Ransom Messages**\n\n1Kss6v4eSUgP4WrYtfYGZGDoRsf74M7CMr\n\n\n-----\n\n1jqpmcLygJdH8fN7BCk2cwwNBRWqMZqL1\n\n1ExbdpvKJ6M1t5KyiZbnzsdQ63SEsY6Bff\n\n**Email Addresses in Ransom Messages**\n\nbackupsql@protonmail[.]com\n\nbackupsql@pm[.]me\n\nbackupdatabase@pm[.]me\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
