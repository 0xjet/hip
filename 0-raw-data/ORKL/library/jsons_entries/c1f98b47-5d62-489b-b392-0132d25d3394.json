C:\\Users\\whg\\Desktop\\Plug\\FastGui(LYT)\\Shell\\Release\\Shell.pdb\n\n ▪ He had a solid track record of developing backdoors and hacking tools, while he claimed\n to sell some “shared software”.\n – Also, he had deep connection with Rose,\n one of the threat actors in APT41.\n\n [2] https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/tracking-down-the-author-of-the-plugx-rat\n\n\n-----\n\n###

ShadowPad\n\n\n-----\n\n### How flexible is the controller?\n\n###### ▪ The plugins are place in a directory.\n\n ▪ In theory, you can upload any plugin within the\n\n\n\n###### ▪ The plugins are place in a directory.\n\n ▪\n correct format.\n\n\n-----\n\n### How flexible is the controller?\n\n###### ▪ … but the user cannot interact with\n the plugins without an interface\n – The interfaces are hardcoded in the\n controller\n – No options to add a new interface\n\n\n-----\n\n### A piece of sold malware with extendibility\n\n###### ▪ ShadowPad is not extendible by the users except the original developer.\n – Not originally designed as a framework.\n\n ▪ The developer can remove a plugin from the package easily.\n – Just remove the plugins from the directory.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Selling the plugins separately\n\n###### Basic set: Root, Plugins, Config, Install, Online, TCP, HTTP, UDP, DNS\n\n\n-----\n\n### Selling the plugins separately\n\n###### A special version: packed by VMProtect, different plugin IDs\n\n\n-----\n\n### Selling the plugins separately\n\n###### With utility plugins embedded\n\n\n-----\n\n### Selling the plugins separately (cont.)\n\n###### ▪ Most of the samples do not have utility plugins embedded in them.\n – Need to upload other plugins remotely through the controllers.\n – The plugins are placed in the directory:\n easy to be removed from a package\n\n ▪ Tick – an active user of ShadowPad – developed a tool with the same functionality of the\n plugin “Software” in an overlapped timeframe.\n – Tick did not have access to that plugin while it was already available\n\n ▪ The plugins should be provided separately.\n – Not given in a full bundle.\n\n\n-----\n\n### The business model of ShadowPad\n\n###### ▪ ShadowPad is a sold malware.\n\n ▪ The plugins need to be acquired separately.\n\n ▪ It is only sold to a limited set of users.\n\n ▪ Why is ShadowPad a good choice for the attackers:\n – The cost to develop a stable backdoor/RAT is high.\n – The plugins (functionalities) are complete, and the attackers can choose which they want.\n\n • ShadowPad was the primary backdoor for long-term espionage in several campaigns.\n – The use of a shared backdoor reduces the chance to be attributed.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Which threat actors are using ShadowPad?\n\n\n-----\n\n### Which threat actors are using ShadowPad?\n\n\n###### Fishmonger\n\n Tropic Trooper\n\n\n###### WINNTI/APT41\n\n\n###### Operation Redbonus\n\n\n###### Tropic Trooper\n\n\n###### Tick and Tonto Team\n\n\n###### Operation Redkanku\n\n\n###### LuckyMouse\n\n\n-----\n\n### WINNTI/APT41\n\n###### Two sub-groups of WINNTI/APT41\n\n § BARIUM (Tan Dailin aka Rose and Zhang Haoran)\n\n – Against the gaming industry and several supply chain attacks, e.g., NetSarang, ASUS, and allegedly, CCleaner\n\n § LEAD (Chengdu 404 Network Technology Co., Ltd)\n\n – Attack for financial and espionage purposes\n\n\n-----\n\n### What is NCPH\n\n###### A hacking group that developed lots of tools and freely shared on NCPH websites\n\n ▪ They also declared that the source\n code was on sale\n\n ▪ Rose and whg have collaboration on\n malware development since 2006\n\n\n###### Rose likely had high privilege access – or was a co-developer – to ShadowPad\n\n\n-----\n\n### Tick and Tonto Team\n\n###### ▪ Two groups amalgamated into a new\n institution during the reorganization of PLA\n\n ▪ Started to use ShadowPad as their primary\n backdoor for conducting intrusion\n\n ▪ TICK\n – Sent spear phishing emails to deliver\n ShadowPad\n\n ▪ Tonto Team\n – Exploited CVE-2019-9489 and CVE-2020-8468\n in Trend Micro’s security solutions to deliver ShadowPad\n\n\n-----\n\n### Customized tools for intrusion\n\n###### Customized tools\n\n ▪ Modified mimikatz\n\n ▪ Screen capture tool\n\n ▪ Packet transmission tool\n\n ▪ Tool to list the software installed on a computer\n – ShadowPad has a plugin with the same functionality\n\n ▪ VBScript command executor tool\n – Generate a payload of VBScript\n – Bypass TrendMicro products\n\n\n-----\n\n### Operation Redbonus\n\n###### § Against Indian country\n\n § Other backdoors in use, such as Whitebird, IceFog and a customized instance of PCShare\n\n\n-----\n\n### Operation Redkanku\n\n###### § All of the C&C servers had a self-signed certificate\n\n § Some related samples were documented to be a part of t he ProxyLogon attacks\n\n\n-----\n\n### Fishmonger\n\n###### § New version of ShadowPad which had updates and more advanced obfuscation techniques\n\n § They are interested in COVID- 19 research in Hong Kong, Taiwan, India and the US.\n\n § ShadowPad and Spyder as their primary backdoors for long-term monitoring\n\n § A self-signed certificate is installed on several C&C servers of ShadowPad and Spyder\n\n\n-----\n\n## Landscape shift\n\n\n-----\n\n#### From developing backdoors to acquiring backdoors\n\n###### ▪ Past\n – Chinese threat actors develop their own tool sets based on their needs during operations\n\n ▪ Now\n – The popularity of malware such as ShadowPad and CobaltStrike among Chinese espionage\n groups\n – Here is an example about Tick's timeline of backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\n### The benfit of acquiring backdoors\n\n###### ▪ Lower the cost\n – Reduces the cost of a well-designed piece of malware\n – Reduces the human resource to develop the malware in-house\n\n ▪ Keeps enhancing the stability and usability\n – The service provider will provide newest version of the backdoor with new features added\n – Unlike much of the commodity malware found in cybercriminal circles or underground forums\n\n\n-----\n\n### Mitigation advice\n\n\n-----\n\n### Mitigation advice for ShadowPad\n\n###### ▪ Audit the services and the registries to find any suspicious items\n\n ▪ Monitor dynamic behaviors of “spawning a new process” and “process injection”\n\n ▪ Apply memory forensics periodically to identify malware which resides in-memory\n\n ▪ Adopt an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution across your organization\n\n ▪ A well consolidated monitoring capability provides visibility into cyber threats\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\n###### ▪ Why do the actors choose to use ShadowPad?\n – Experienced developers to develop something much better with active updates\n – Reducing the cost of operation and development\n – Harder for security company to do further research\n\n ▪ Why ShadowPad is not disappearing?\n – Still under updates with more advanced obfuscation and persistence techniques\n – A powerful backdoor with more functionalities so good for long-term espionage operations and\n keep stealthy under the radar\n\n ▪ How ShadowPad affect threat intelligence?\n – Need to develop more systematic ways for attribution\n\n\n-----\n\n# Thank You\n\n###### sentinelone.com\n\n\n-----",
