When a\nnew potential threat emerges, information security professionals often find themselves\nneeding to translate vague descriptions and untested research artifacts into actionable\nintelligence for their own particular risk models.\n\n\n-----\n\nRapid7 researchers analyze thousands of vulnerabilities each year to understand root\ncauses, dispel misconceptions, and share information on why certain flaws are more likely to\nbe exploited than others. This report examines 50 vulnerabilities from the 2020 calendar year\nin order to highlight exploitation trends, explore attacker use cases, and offer a framework for\nunderstanding new security threats as they arise. Our aim is to contextualize the\nvulnerabilities that introduce serious risk to a wide range of organizations—and those that\nprobably don’t. We have also included a practical applications section with guidance for\ndefenders.\n\n[This is not a threat intelligence report, though we do make use of cyber threat intelligence](https://www.cisecurity.org/blog/what-is-cyber-threat-intelligence/)\n(CTI) terminology within it. There are many fine purveyors of threat intelligence who do a\nfirst-rate job of mapping motives and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to specific\nthreat actors. Traditional CTI methodologies and elements, including artifacts like indicators\nof compromise (IOCs), are outside the scope of this paper.\n\nThere is a substantial amount of data incorporated into the sections below, including a\nnumber of overarching metadata types Rapid7 researchers have defined and normalized. It’s\nall important, but don’t let it fool you: This is very much a report about instinct—the hunches\nthat drive security researchers and exploit developers—with a dash of history to boot.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe volume of published vulnerabilities has grown significantly over the past five years. 2017\nexperienced a 127% increase in CVE-named vulnerabilities over 2016, and each year of\nCVEs since then has topped its predecessor in sheer volume. By the time the year came to a\n[close, 2020 racked up 18,362 vulnerabilities, which represented a 6% increase over 2019](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/statistics?form_type=Basic&results_type=statistics&search_type=all)\nand a dizzying 185% rise from five years ago. December 2020’s revelations about nation\nstate-backed campaigns that compromised more than half a dozen U.S. government\nagencies and thousands of organizations globally capped a turbulent year of high-priority\nsecurity flaws, some of the most severe of which occurred in internet-facing technologies\ncritical to protecting a newly remote workforce.\n\nOf course, not all of 2020’s security flaws stood shoulder to shoulder—even those given\nperfect 10 severity scores.\n\nWe look at 50 distinct CVEs in this report: 30 of these vulnerabilities were exploited in the\nwild in 2020, either broadly in indiscriminate attacks or in smaller-scale, targeted attacks. The\nremaining 20 vulnerabilities are not known to be actively exploited and are classified as\nimpending threats because of their value to attackers, the discoverability of technical details,\nand/or the general availability of exploit code. Of course, the absence of evidence doesn’t\nmean these vulnerabilities haven’t been exploited—only that no exploitation has been\npublicly disclosed.\n\n2020 findings include:\n\n\n-----\n\n**In this report, we examine 14 vulnerabilities that became widespread threats and**\n**posed substantial risks to organizations of all sizes in 2020. You will undoubtedly**\nrecognize many of these widely exploited vulnerabilities, which include WebLogic\nServer and ManageEngine zero-days in addition to the likes of RECON and Zerologon.\nThe 14 CVEs in our widespread threat list were exploited by a wide range of malicious\nparties, from state-sponsored threat actors to run-of-the-mill “commodity” attackers.\n**Critical vulnerabilities featured prominently in security news headlines in 2020,**\n**but some flaws were much more exploitable than others. Deserialization and**\nimproper access control vulnerabilities were the root cause of some of the most\nwidespread threats of 2020, accounting for 78% of CVEs in our dataset that were\nexploited at scale.\n**Some of 2020’s most high-impact vulnerabilities occurred in security products**\n**that sat in critical and often exposed places in organizations’ networks. Nine of**\nthe vulnerabilities we examine in this report functioned as network pivots, providing\nopportunities for external attackers to gain internal network access by exploiting VPNs,\nfirewalls, or other internet-facing technologies. These flaws are often used in\nconjunction with local code execution vulnerabilities or network protocol bugs to\nescalate privileges or move laterally across corporate networks.\n**2020 included multiple vulnerability suites that disproportionately affected**\n**operational technology (OT) and Internet of Things (IoT) implementations of low-**\n**level software libraries. While these vulnerability groups garnered quite a lot of**\nattention, Rapid7 and SCADAfence research teams independently determined their\nexploitability to be much lower than some other vulnerabilities affecting the OT\necosystem. Vendor and supply chain fragmentation further underscored the need for\nlong-term visibility across OT networks.\n**Defenders had to contend with a steady stream of patch bypasses in 2020, which**\n**disrupted remediation cycles and introduced risk that was more likely to be**\n**missed. Our vulnerability dataset includes nine patch bypasses or incomplete patches,**\nseven of which circumvent fixes for known-exploited or high-value parent\nvulnerabilities. One trend we observed is that it’s common for software vendors to\nmitigate disclosed attack chains rather than addressing the root cause of bugs reported\nto them; this may partially account for the prevalence of patch bypasses last year.\n\n## Big Picture: 2020 Threats\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Big Picture: 2020 Threats Actively Exploited and Other Significant CVEs\n\n[In an interesting twist, 2020 marked the advent of zero-day disclosures and](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0027.html) public threat\nintelligence coming directly from the U.S. National Security Agency (as well as from more\n[traditional sources like CISA and country CERTs). This](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts) [nascent practice, no doubt intended](https://www.wired.com/story/nsa-windows-10-vulnerability-disclosure/)\nto accelerate patching as much as to demonstrate a new commitment to transparency, has\ncontributed to a heightened sense of urgency—and occasionally alarm—that is amplified by\nsecurity news media reporting (rightfully) on intelligence agency alerts. It is difficult to discuss\nthe threat landscape of the past year without acknowledging the role U.S. agencies have\nplayed in shaping perceptions and influencing priorities, particularly since news headlines on\nthese disclosures are likely to reach executives and business stakeholders as well as\nsecurity practitioner audiences.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe make a distinction in our data between vulnerabilities that see widespread, indiscriminate\nexploitation (widespread threats) and those that, based on available evidence, have been\nused in highly targeted attacks (targeted threats). Almost all of the targeted threats in our\ndataset were reported by a single credible source as having been exploited, with no further\npublic reports of exploitation thereafter. This includes many of the flaws in our targeted threat\ncategory that were zero-days when they were disclosed.\n\nConversely, CVEs in our widespread threat category have typically been exploited by a\nrange of malicious actors, from botnet controllers to APTs to low-skilled attackers throwing\npublic proof-of-concept (PoC) code against internet-exposed hosts. In other words, if we\nhave classified a threat as widespread, that classification is based on the volume of attacks\nrather than who specifically is doing the attacking. When applying learnings from 2020 to the\ncurrent year and beyond, organizations should expect to conduct incident response\ninvestigations that look for IOCs and suspicious activity during widespread threat events in\naddition to activating emergency patching protocols.\n\n**What is a threat?**\n\nWhen there is an adversary with the intent, capability, and opportunity, a threat exists. When\ntwo or more of these elements are present (e.g., intent and capability, but no opportunity), we\ncall it an impending threat, because there is just one missing piece before it becomes a true\nthreat. When there is just one element present (e.g., an opportunity in the form of a software\nvulnerability), we call it a potential threat. There is the potential for it to turn into a true threat,\nalthough there are additional components that need to come to fruition before it has a real\nimpact to most organizations\n\n\n-----\n\n## Widespread Threats\n\nFourteen CVEs posed widespread threats to organizations in 2020 and are likely to stalk\nunpatched systems well into 2021. The impact of successful exploitation for each of these\nvulnerabilities is high; most allow for remote code execution (RCE) at a minimum, but several\nallow unauthenticated, remote attackers to take over infrastructure or gain access to internal\nnetworks through exploitation of vulnerable internet-facing systems or interfaces. It’s worth\nnoting that two of the entries in this category—Zoho ManageEngine CVE-2020-10189 and\n[vBulletin CVE-2020-17496—were released into the wild as](https://twitter.com/steventseeley/status/1235635108498948096) [zero-days with stable exploit](https://www.zdnet.com/article/security-researcher-publishes-details-and-exploit-code-for-a-vbulletin-zero-day/)\ncode before the vendors made patches available.\n\n\n**Attacker**\n**Utility**\n\nRemote code\nexecution\n\n\n**Vulnerability**\n**Class**\n\nDeserialization\n/ .NET\n\n\n**CVE**\n\n**[CVE-2019-18935](https://attackerkb.com/topics/ZA24eUeDg5/cve-2019-18935?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nTelerik UI RadAsyncUpload\n.NET Deserialization\n\n**[CVE-2019-19781](https://attackerkb.com/topics/x22buZozYJ/cve-2019-19781?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nCitrix NetScaler\nADC/Gateway/SD-WAN\nArbitrary Code Execution\n\n**[CVE-2020-0688](https://attackerkb.com/topics/XbYcn2Mckk/cve-2020-0688---exchange-control-panel-viewstate-deserialization-bug?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nMicrosoft Exchange Server\nStatic Validation Key Remote\nCode Execution\n\n**[CVE-2020-0796](https://attackerkb.com/topics/2LCXe3EPAZ/cve-2020-0796---smbghost?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nWindows SMBv3 Server\nRemote Code Execution\n\"SMBGhost\"\n\n**[CVE-2020-10189](https://attackerkb.com/topics/PyNCrvKjzq/cve-2020-10189?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nZoho ManageEngine Remote\nCode Execution\n\n\n**CVSS**\n**v3** **Threat Status**\n\n9.8 Widespread\nThreat\nExploited in the\nwild\n\n9.8 Widespread\nThreat\nExploited in the\nwild\n\n8.8 Widespread\nThreat\nExploited in the\nwild\n\n10 Widespread\nThreat\nExploited in the\nwild\n\n9.8 Widespread\nThreat\nExploited in the\nwild (released\nas 0day)\n\n\nNetwork pivot Improper\nAccess\nControl\n\n\nRemote code\nexecution\n\nRemote code\nexecution\n\nNetwork\ninfrastructure\ncompromise\n\n\nDeserialization\n/ .NET\n\nMemory\nCorruption\n\nDeserialization\n/ Java\n\n\n-----\n\n**[CVE-2020-11651](https://attackerkb.com/topics/rEVl04z1p0/cve-2020-11651?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nSaltStack Salt Remote Code\nExecution\n\n**[CVE-2020-1472](https://attackerkb.com/topics/7FbcgDOidQ/cve-2020-1472-aka-zerologon?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nNetLogon Elevation of\nPrivilege \"Zerologon\"\n\n**[CVE-2020-14750](https://attackerkb.com/topics/mzyS1rMcZc/cve-2020-14750-oracle-weblogic-remote-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nWebLogic Unauthenticated\nRemote Code Execution\nPatch Bypass\n\n**[CVE-2020-14882](https://attackerkb.com/topics/sb4F8UT5zu/cve-2020-14882-unauthenticated-rce-in-console-component-of-oracle-weblogic-server?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nOracle WebLogic Server\nRemote Code Execution\n\n**[CVE-2020-15505](https://attackerkb.com/topics/Mo2aQDjmZ2/cve-2020-15505?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nMobileIron Core and\nConnector Remote Code\nExecution\n\n**[CVE-2020-17496](https://attackerkb.com/topics/2GE9f3C0gk/cve-2020-17496?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nvBulletin subWidgets data\nRCE\n\n**[CVE-2020-3452](https://attackerkb.com/topics/XGKhvbDsLA/cve-2020-3452-cisco-asa-firepower-read-only-path-traversal-vulnerability?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nCisco ASA/FTD Web Services\nRead-Only Path Traversal\nVulnerability\n\n**[CVE-2020-5902](https://attackerkb.com/topics/evLpPlZf0i/cve-2020-5902-tmui-rce-vulnerability?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nF5 Big-IP TMUI Remote Code\nExecution\n\n\n9.8 Widespread\nThreat\nExploited in the\nwild\n\n10 Widespread\nThreat\nExploited in the\nwild\n\n9.8 Widespread\nThreat\nExploited in the\nwild\n\n9.8 Widespread\nThreat\nExploited in the\nwild\n\n9.8 Widespread\nThreat\nExploited in the\nwild\n\n9.8 Widespread\nThreat\nExploited in the\nwild (released\nas 0day)\n\n7.5 Widespread\nThreat\nExploited in the\nwild\n\n10 Widespread\nThreat\nExploited in the\nwild\n\n\nNetwork\ninfrastructure\ncompromise\n\nLateral\nmovement\n\nRemote code\nexecution\n\nRemote code\nexecution\n\nRemote code\nexecution\n\nRemote code\nexecution\n\nFile\nenumeration\n\n\nImproper\nAccess\nControl\n\nImproper\nAccess\nControl\n\nImproper\nAccess\nControl\n\nImproper\nAccess\nControl\n\nDeserialization\n/ Java\n\nInjection\n\nInjection\n\n\nNetwork pivot Improper\nAccess\nControl\n\n\n-----\n\n**[CVE-2020-6287](https://attackerkb.com/topics/JubO1RiVBP/cve-2020-6287-critical-vulnerability-in-sap-netweaver-application-server-as-java?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nSAP NetWeaver AS Java\n\"RECON\"\n\n\n10 Widespread\nThreat\nExploited in the\nwild\n\n\nRemote code\nexecution\n\n\nImproper\nAccess\nControl\n\n\n2020 opened with widespread exploitation of Citrix NetScaler and Telerik UI. Zoho\nManageEngine and SaltStack Salt followed suit in the spring, while the second half of the\nyear was punctuated by internet-scale exploitation of severe vulnerabilities in F5 BIG-IP,\nMicrosoft NetLogon Remote Protocol, and Oracle WebLogic Server. The combination of an\nauthentication bypass and a remote code execution flaw in MobileIron’s Mobile Device\nManagement (MDM) solution also offered a glimpse at how mobile device management\nsoftware may prove a potent attack vector in the future, even after the remote workforce has\nbegun to transition back to the office.\n\nThere are three outliers in this group that merit closer inspection. The first is CVE-20200796, or “SMBGhost,” a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft’s Server Message\n[Block (SMB) 3.1.1 protocol that the company inadvertently published in their March 2020](https://blog.rapid7.com/2020/03/12/cve-2020-0796-microsoft-smbv3-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-analysis/)\nPatch Tuesday advisory before a patch had been released. An out-of-band security update\ncame within 24 hours of the slip, but not before the security community had likened the flaw\nto MS17-010, the SMB vulnerability suite exploited as part of the 2017 WannaCry and\nNotPetya attacks that cost [global organizations](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-is-how-much-the-wannacry-ransomware-attack-cost-the-nhs/) [hundreds of millions of dollars.](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/notpetya-ransomware-outbreak-cost-merck-more-than-300m-per-quarter/)\n\nNetwork defenders feared the vulnerability would be widely exploited and wormed, but no\nworms have materialized, at least thus far. In fact, while public proof-of-concept code and an\nerrant botnet took aim at SMBGhost, it’s a bit difficult to argue that the exploits fully arrived,\neither: Modern memory protections meant that even though a few local exploits made their\nway to market, remote code execution remains nontrivial (mass migration to remote work\n[may actually have helped limit the vuln’s impact) Even the Lemon Duck botnet appeared to](https://attackerkb.com/assessments/6f312f6f-6eaa-4855-a565-097eaaa61c86)\n\n\n-----\n\n[give up on its SMBGhost exploit module after a trial run. We ve included CVE-2020-0796 in](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/08/25/lemon_duck-cryptominer-targets-cloud-apps-linux/)\nour list of widespread threats for the sake of methodological consistency, but it’s an\nexception instead of the rule.\n\nAnother exception is CVE-2020-3452, a read-only path traversal flaw in Cisco’s Adaptive\nSecurity Appliance (ASA) and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) products that allowed remote\nattackers to enumerate files on target devices. The anomaly here is value rather than\nexploitability—although a PoC was quickly published and, to quote Microsoft’s Kevin\nBeaumont, “mass spammed across [the] internet,” exploitation offered attackers no useful\naccess at all. CVE-2020-3452 is also the only vulnerability from among our sample of\nwidespread threats for which Metasploit opted not to prioritize an exploit.\n\nFinally, if there were a 2020 Microsoft vulnerability that rivaled MS17-010 for severity and\ncatastrophic impact to networked systems, the title would go to “Zerologon” (CVE-20201472), a cryptographic flaw in Microsoft’s Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC) that allows\nattackers to bypass authentication and compromise Windows Servers running as domain\ncontrollers, paving the way for complete takeover of Active Directory domains. The rare\nCVSS-10 privilege escalation vulnerability in Microsoft’s August 2020 Patch Tuesday release\nraised eyebrows, but the advisory was characteristically sparse. Details remained thin until\n[Secura researchers released in-depth analysis mid-September, which was followed by](https://www.secura.com/blog/zero-logon)\nrampant exploitation.\n\nBoth Zerologon and the MS17-010 suite of vulnerabilities gave attackers trivially exploitable\npaths for lateral movement that lend themselves well to ransomware campaigns (including\nransomworms). Unlike the 2017 CVEs, which provided for both remote and local code\nexecution, successful exploitation of Zerologon requires network access to a domain\ncontroller—in other words, an attacker would need either an internet-exposed domain\ncontroller or some type of initial access to the network (e.g., a network pivot). 2020’s threat\nlist included quite a few potential network pivots; we’ll come back to this later on.\n\n## Targeted Threats\n\nRoughly half of the actively exploited vulnerabilities in our dataset fell into the “targeted\nthreat” category—which, again, does not mean these CVEs haven’t been (or won’t be)\nexploited more broadly, only that there is not yet any public evidence of exploitation at scale.\nIn particular, Sophos XG Firewall CVE-2020-12271 and VMware ESXi CVE-2020-3992\nbelow are incredibly attractive targets for attackers due to the considerable access they\nprovide (Sophos has a detailed analysis of the zero-day attack against their XG Firewall\n[here). The same goes for the three Citrix vulnerabilities, which were resolved in one update](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/04/26/asnarok/)\n[and saw small-scale exploitation even as they were moving

had seen in-the-wild attacks targeting the\nflaw, but said that Microsoft had already prepared a patch by the time they notified them. We\nstill classify this CVE as a zero-day even if Kaspersky was not the only company to observe\nexploitation.\n\nEight of the CVEs above—fully half of this group—were reported to the software producers\nas zero-days that had already seen in-the-wild exploitation: three by Google’s Project Zero\nand/or Threat Analysis Group (CVE-2020-1020, CVE-2020-17087, and CVE-2020-15999),\none by the NSA (VMware CVE-2020-4006), and the rest via various security researchers\nand firms. SolarWinds Orion CVE-2020-10148 is among this group, and it bears mentioning\nhere that it is extremely likely this vulnerability has been more broadly exploited. At time of\nwriting, however, there were no public reports of widespread exploitation—only reports of\nmass scanning—so we have classified it as a targeted threat until broader exploitation is\nconfirmed.\n\nThe CVEs in Windows DNS Server (2020-1350), Windows CryptoAPI (2020-0601), Cisco\nIOS XR (2020-3118), and VMware Workspace ONE (2020-4006), in addition to all three\nCitrix vulnerabilities, were included in Q4 2020 publications issued by the NSA on\n[vulnerabilities being exploited by either Russian (VMware CVE-2020-4006) or Chinese (the](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/07/2002547071/-1/-1/0/CSA_VMWARE%20ACCESS_U_OO_195076_20.PDF)\n[rest) state-sponsored threat actors. (The NSA was also the entity that disclosed “Curveball”](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2020-0601)\nCVE-2020-0601 to Microsoft back in January 2020.) All told, NSA communications were the\nsource material for a significant portion of our 2020 security threat dataset.\n\n## Impending Threats\n\nWith actively exploited vulnerabilities out of the way, we can turn our attention to some of\n2020’s notable impending threats. As a brief reminder, an impending threat occurs when\ntwo elements of the threat triangle are present, but not all three. Since this paper centers on\nvulnerabilities, the opportunity element is present by default. The impending threats we\npresent in this section include either a capability (i.e., a mature exploit) or a proxy for\nmeasurable intent. Quite a few of the vulnerabilities we’ve classified as targeted threats\nwould have stayed in the impending threat category without the NSA’s Q4 2020 bulletins on\nflaws exploited by state-sponsored actors.\n\n**Note: Several of the vulnerabilities in this group have public proof-of-concept (PoC) code**\navailable, but for the purposes of this paper, we consider public PoC to be similar to technical\ndetails in that it may enable others to build successful exploit chains or improve upon attack\n\n\n-----\n\ntechniques, but it isn t the same as mature code. Proof-of-concept code often has a way to\ngo before it becomes a fully weaponized and documented exploit, if it makes it that far at all.\nAs Marie Antoinette famously pointed out,\n\n\"PoC works on my machine; an exploit works on yours.\"\n\n\n**Threat**\n**Status**\n\nImpending\nThreat\nExploit\nAvailable\n\nImpending\nThreat\nExploit\nAvailable\n\nImpending\nThreat\nExploit\nAvailable\n\nImpending\nThreat\nExploit\nAvailable\n\nImpending\nThreat\nExploit\nAvailable\n\nImpending\nThreat\nExploit\nAvailable\n\nImpending\nThreat\nHigh-Value\nTarget\n\n\n**Attacker**\n**Utility**\n\nLocal

in this table all represent Metasploit modules that have\nbeen developed and tested for compatibility across a range of platforms. Metasploit is not the\n[only toolkit we consider to be mature as far as capability goes—the Zerologon exploit built on](https://github.com/dirkjanm/CVE-2020-1472)\nImpacket, for instance, would have met the “exploit available” bar even before it was ported\nto Metasploit Framework. In the same vein, “high-value target” is a subjective term, though a\ncommon-sense one given the broad popularity of the products we’ve listed. “Technical details\nwidely available” denotes in-depth, public information on identifying, triggering, and\n(frequently) exploiting the vulnerability in question. Technical details commonly include proofof-concept code or demonstrations.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen a vulnerability occurs in a product with demonstrable value to attackers and a recent\nhistory of exploitation, it stands to reason that the intent component of the threat triangle is\npresent even if there’s not yet evidence of successful in-the-wild exploitation. There might be\nno better example of this principle than Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint vulnerabilities,\nthree of which are notable impending threats (SharePoint CVE-2020-16952, and Exchange\nCVEs 2020-16875 and 2020-17132). Both products have remained consistently attractive\n[targets for zero-day research, exploit development, and in-the-wild attacks over the years,](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/sharepoint-vulnerability-uk-organisations)\nwhich is no surprise given that vulnerabilities in Exchange and SharePoint environments can\nfacilitate full compromises of Active Directory.\n\n\"We consider most critical-rated and many important-rated CVEs in Microsoft\nExchange and SharePoint to be strong impending threat candidates, regardless of\nwhether exploit code has been released.\"\n\nUnfortunately, [patch rates continue to lag, as seen in the following data:](https://blog.rapid7.com/2020/04/06/phishing-for-system-on-microsoft-exchange-cve-2020-0688/)\n\nA few other CVEs in this group are worth highlighting for their value to would-be attackers:\nHP Device Manager CVE-2020-6926 and VMware vCenter Server CVE-2020-3952 are\nsevere vulnerabilities in management software for Windows thin clients and virtualization\ninfrastructure, respectively.

Attackers work off\na wholly different guiding principle—namely, that the discovery of one flaw means there are\nlikely more just waiting in the wings, frequently in the same function, protocol, or section of\nthe target product’s code base. However, it hardly makes sense for attackers to put effort into\nhunting for zero-day vulnerabilities when they can change a single character in an exploit for\na patched vulnerability and blow past the patch as if it weren’t even there.\n\n2020 revealed a number of patch bypass CVEs and incomplete fixes across a large crosssection of vendors, products, web applications, operating systems, and libraries. We detail\n[nine of them here, but these are far from all-inclusive. 2020 was a banner year for patch](https://twitter.com/maddiestone/status/1341781307508969473)\nbypasses, which is unfortunate for the many organizations whose patch cycles were\ndisrupted or whose risk increased without their knowledge. Many of the patch bypasses we\ninclude in this report also have parent vulns that have either been actively exploited in the\nwild (e.g., Oracle WebLogic Server CVE-2020-14750, Windows kernel CVE-2020-17008,\nvBulletin CVE-2020-17496) or are widely documented (e.g., Windows “PrintDemon” CVE2020-1337, which, incidentally, _[also has a patch bypass).](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2075)_\n\nWhat might explain this vulnerability déjà vu? In some cases, a vulnerability’s complexity can\nmake solutions correspondingly complex to develop quickly and well. In fact,\n\nMany of the patch bypass techniques Rapid7 researchers evaluated over the course of\nthe year were possible because filtering was added to stages of the original attack\nchain in lieu of addressing the bug’s root cause.\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft Exchange CVE-2020-16875 is a good example of this, where the fix mitigated the\ndisclosed attack chain instead of the root cause, leading to the disclosure of patch bypass\nCVE-2020-17132.\n\nIt can also be difficult to address root cause when a vulnerability occurs in a component or\nbehavior that’s closely related to the core architecture of the host system, which may not be\nable to be modified without adversely affecting legitimate use. Sometimes this occurs when\nthe vulnerability is a feature that can be abused within the application, as with vBulletin CVE2020-17496. The vulnerability in this case was related to how PHP templates were\nprocessed—intended and important functionality within vBulletin. If you’re looking for a\n[second use case, this PyYAML library vulnerability is a good one. In both cases, the](https://attackerkb.com/topics/elaU1iEIoz/cve-2020-14343?referrer=2020VTR)\nmaintaining projects opted to implement filtering and other controls to restrict access to the\nfeatures that had been abused. Ultimately, of course, those controls were bypassed.\n\nThe prevalence of patch bypasses over the past year underscores the need for defense-indepth strategies that include awareness of critical or exposed systems. See the guidance\nsection at the end of this report for high-level recommendations.\n\n## The Dream of a Common Language\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Dream of a Common Language Practical Vulnerability Shorthand\n\nWhen getting to know a new vulnerability, the first thing our research teams look for is an\nunderstanding of root cause and what an attacker might use the bug to achieve.\n[Vulnerabilities arise from hundreds of conditions spanning all layers of the stack—from](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html)\napplication programming errors to cryptographic implementations to hardware bugs and\nbeyond. Likewise, the potential impact of any given vulnerability can vary widely based on\nimplementation, security controls, and the sensitivity of the data or permissions an attacker\ncan obtain as a result of exploitation. (To use an example from our own data, a remote file\n[disclosure vulnerability might yield as little as benign source code files or as much](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Reminder+Patch+Cisco+ASA+FTD+Devices+CVE20203452+Exploitation+Continues/26426/)\nas [sensitive account credentials.)](https://attackerkb.com/topics/lx3Afd7fbJ/cve-2019-11510?referrer=2020VTR)\n\nAs you may have noticed by now, we’ve characterized the vulnerabilities in our report\ndataset by their attacker utility and vulnerability class in addition to separating them by threat\nstatus. Attacker utility describes what an attacker can hope to gain as a result of successful\nexploitation—this often maps to a part of an exploit chain—while vulnerability class is an\numbrella term that encompasses both root cause and the type of high-level technique that\nmight trigger it.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe’ve defined four vulnerability classes—improper access control, memory corruption,\ninjection, and deserialization—that are useful for making initial assessments of readily\navailable attacker tooling and forming high-level hypotheses on relative exploitability.\n**Injection attacks, for instance, use specially crafted input and techniques (e.g., SQL**\ninjection, operating system command injection) to compromise data integrity or run arbitrary\ncode as a high-privileged user. These attacks tend to be stable and reliable, which makes\nthem less likely to knock over systems than, say, attacks leveraging memory corruption\n[flaws. Deserialization vulnerabilities come with a reputation for high exploitability and have a](https://www.rapid7.com/research/report/exploiting-jsos/)\nwealth of off-the-shelf tools with which to build exploit chains. And improper access control\nflaws—the vulnerability class most represented in both our dataset overall and in the\nwidespread threats we’ve included—run the gamut from complex weaponization\nrequirements to [trivial exploitability using curl.](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/07/inside-the-f5-big-ip-tmui-rce-vulnerability-cve-2020-5902)\n\nDeserialization and improper access control bugs together are responsible for 11 of the\nmost severe and impactful vulnerabilities of 2020.\n\nImproper access control vulnerabilities in particular posed a consistent threat to corporate\nnetworks, allowing attackers to bypass authentication (if it existed at all), execute code, add\nadministrative users, and write files to disk.

A network pivot—aptly if unimaginatively named—gives the attacker visibility\ninto both internal and external traffic, most often by exploiting internet-facing systems such\nas VPNs, firewalls, routers, and other gateway devices. Network pivots aid in data\nexfiltration, traffic sniffing, and further attacks within the target network; they are, in short,\nextremely valuable to both state-sponsored and low-skilled attackers, along with penetration\ntesters the world over.\n\nSome of the past year’s most high-profile and widely exploited vulnerabilities fell into the\nnetwork pivot category. The first vulnerability to see large-scale exploitation in 2020 was\nCitrix NetScaler/Application Delivery Controller CVE-2019-19781, a directory traversal flaw\nthat made its debut in December 2019 and harried incident responders well into the new\n\n\n-----\n\nyear. The vulnerability allowed remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute code on\nvulnerable gateways—and it wasn’t the only Citrix CVE that acted as a network pivot point\nfor attackers in 2020. The NSA [warned in October that Chinese state-sponsored actors were](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Oct/20/2002519884/-1/-1/0/CSA_CHINESE_EXPLOIT_VULNERABILITIES_UOO179811.PDF)\nexploiting three other vulnerabilities in Citrix’s Application Delivery Controller, at least one of\n[which could be used to extract valid VPN sessions with which to establish a foothold on](https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/07/10/rift-citrix-adc-vulnerabilities-cve-2020-8193-cve-2020-8195-and-cve-2020-8196-intelligence/)\ninternal networks.\n\nFor many network defenders, June 29 through July 29, 2020 was a particularly nightmarish\nstretch of an already challenging year: No fewer than four CVSS 10 vulnerabilities hit\nadvisories, mailing lists, and news alerts during this period, three of which occurred within\ntwo weeks of one another. On June 29, Palo Alto Networks published a security advisory for\nCVE-2020-2021, a SAML authentication bypass affecting the company’s PAN-OS operating\nsystem, which runs on gateways, portals, VPNs, and the firm’s next-generation firewalls.\nSAML, or security assertion markup language, was (fortunately) not the default\n[authentication scheme, and the company reinforced that attackers would need network](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2020-2021)\naccess for successful exploitation. Still, an initial Rapid7 Labs study revealed just under\n70,000 instances of Palo Alto Networks’ Global Protect VPN on the public internet—an\nenticing pool of targets for attackers looking to access protected resources and find a way\ninto corporate networks.\n\n[A day later, on June 30, 2020, F5 Networks quietly published a security bulletin advising](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K52145254)\ncustomers of CVE-2020-5902, a severe remote code execution vulnerability in “undisclosed\npages” of the Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI) of its BIG-IP product. Within a few\ndays, multiple confirmations of exploitation in the wild had surfaced, along with reports of\ncoin miners and automated secret scrapers targeting vulnerable BIG-IP instances, several\nthousand of which were exposed to the internet. F5 disclosed on July 8 that their previously\nreleased mitigation advice was able to be circumvented, and that anyone whose TMUI had\nbeen exposed to the internet should invoke incident response procedures—a series of\nevents similar to Citrix CVE-2019-19781 earlier in the year, albeit on a bigger scale.\n\nIt wasn’t until the end of July, 2020 that security firm Claroty released research detailing\n[multiple critical vulnerabilities affecting various VPN implementations used primarily by](https://attackerkb.com/topics/lRQRKyIkBR/remote-code-execution-vulnerabilities-in-secomea-moxa-and-hms-ewon-vpns?referrer=2020VTR#rapid7-analysis)\nindustrial control systems (ICS) and operational technology (OT) networks. Taken together,\nthe CVEs allowed attackers to decrypt VPN traffic, execute code remotely, and pilfer\ncredentials for use in further attacks. If that weren’t enough, it transpired that some 1,900\n[odd VPN gateways were exposing their Telnet administration port to the public internet.](https://blog.rapid7.com/2020/07/29/remote-code-execution-risks-in-secomea-moxa-and-hms-ewon-ics-vpn-vulnerabilities-what-you-need-to-know/)\n\nIn each of these cases, the gateway position of the vulnerable products amplified the\nvulnerabilities’ severity and deepened the impact of exploitation. In October, several weeks\nafter Zerologon exploitation had wrought havoc on vulnerable domain controllers, the U.S.\nCybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA) published an alert warning that APT\n[actors were chaining network pivot vulnerabilities with Zerologon in attacks against federal,](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-283a)\nstate, local, and tribal networks, in addition to critical infrastructure and elections\norganizations Several of the vulnerabilities CISA listed as potential targets—including Palo\n\n\n-----\n\nAlto Networks, F5, and Citrix flaws discussed above—are included in this report as potential\nor active threats. They aren’t alone: As a start, any of the vulnerabilities identified as a\nnetwork pivot in our data could be used to similar ends. Their utility to attackers should make\nthem a high priority for defenders.\n\n## Blues, Bleeds, Neighbors, and Ghosts: Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities\n\n2020 memory corruption CVEs:\n\n\n**Attacker**\n**Utility**\n\nNetwork\nPivot\n\nRemote code\nexecution\n\nLocal code\nexecution\n\nRemote code\nexecution\n\nLocal code\nexecution\n\n\n**Vulnerability**\n**Class**\n\nMemory\nCorruption\n\nMemory\nCorruption\n\nMemory\nCorruption\n\nMemory\nCorruption\n\nMemory\nCorruption\n\n\n**CVE**\n\n**[CVE-2020-5135](https://attackerkb.com/topics/WzuBknGmx1/cve-2020-5135?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nSonicWall SonicOS Portal Buffer\nOverflow\n\n**[CVE-2020-16898](https://attackerkb.com/topics/17lFRTT1DO/cve-2020-16898-aka-bad-neighbor-ping-of-death-redux?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nWindows TCP/IP Remote Code\nExecution \"Bad Neighbor\"\n\n**[CVE-2020-17008](https://attackerkb.com/topics/cKeyeWef0b/cve-2020-17008-splwow64-elevation-of-privilege-patch-bypass?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nsplWOW64 Elevation of\nPrivilege Patch Bypass\n\n**[CVE-2020-0609](https://attackerkb.com/topics/Er1dwnOh2a/windows-remote-desktop-gateway-rce-cve-2020-0609?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nWindows Remote Desktop\nGateway Remote Code\nExecution \"BlueGate\"\n\n**[CVE-2020-17087](https://attackerkb.com/topics/y8mmBHc710/cve-2020-17087-windows-kernel-local-privilege-escalation-0day?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nWindows Kernel Local Privilege\nEscalation\n\n\n**CVSS**\n**v3** **Threat Status**\n\n9.4 Impending\nThreat\nHigh-Value\nTarget\n\n8.8 Impending\nThreat\nHigh-Value\nTarget\n\nTBD Impending\nThreat\nTechnical\n[Details Widely](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2096)\nAvailable\n\n9.8 Impending\nThreat\nTechnical\n[Details Widely](https://www.kryptoslogic.com/blog/2020/01/rdp-to-rce-when-fragmentation-goes-wrong/)\nAvailable\n\n7.8 Targeted\nThreat\nExploited in\nthe wild\n(reported as\n0day)\n\n\n-----\n\n**[CVE-2020-0986](https://attackerkb.com/topics/bQeeJLG1aP/cve-2020-0986?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nWindows Sandbox Escape via\nsplw64 Untrusted Pointer\nDereference\n\n**[CVE-2020-1020](https://attackerkb.com/topics/IE2z4hqlku/cve-2020-1020?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nWindows Adobe Font Manager\nLibrary Remote Code Execution\n\n**[CVE-2020-14871](https://attackerkb.com/topics/WdJE1KGWIz/cve-2020-14871?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nOracle Solaris PAM Remote\nCode Execution\n\n**[CVE-2020-15999](https://attackerkb.com/topics/CqH1gMBHJC/cve-2020-15999-chrome-freetype-0day?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nGoogle Chrome FreeType Heap\nBuffer Overflow\n\n**[CVE-2020-3992](https://attackerkb.com/topics/a5SgSHJ1Mx/cve-2020-3992-esxi-openslp-remote-code-execution-vulnerability?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nVMware ESXi OpenSLP UseAfter-Free Remote Code\nExecution (Incomplete Patch)\n\n**[CVE-2020-3118](https://attackerkb.com/topics/IHgMyozCu2/cve-2020-3118-aka-cdpwn?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nCisco IOS XR Software\nDiscovery Protocol Format\nString Vulnerability \"CDPwn\"\n\n**[CVE-2020-1350](https://attackerkb.com/topics/egp32neD6z/cve-2020-1350-windows-dns-server-remote-code-execution-sigred?referrer=VTR2020)**\n\nWindows DNS Server Remote\nCode Execution \"SigRed\"\n\n\n7.8 Targeted\nThreat\nExploited in\nthe wild\n(reported as\n0day*)\n\n8.8 Targeted\nThreat\nExploited in\nthe wild\n(reported as\n0day)\n\n10 Targeted\nThreat\nExploited in\nthe wild\n(reported as\n0day)\n\n6.5 Targeted\nThreat\nExploited in\nthe wild\n(reported as\n0day)\n\n9.8 Targeted\nThreat\nExploited in\nthe wild\n\n8.8 Targeted\nThreat\nExploited in\nthe wild\n\n10 Targeted\nThreat\nExploited in\nthe wild\n\n\nLocal code\nexecution\n\nRemote code\nexecution\n\nRemote code\nexecution\n\nRemote code\nexecution\n\nNetwork\ninfrastructure\ncompromise\n\nRemote code\nexecution\n\nRemote code\nexecution\n\n\nMemory\nCorruption\n\nMemory\nCorruption\n\nMemory\nCorruption\n\nMemory\nCorruption\n\nMemory\nCorruption\n\nMemory\nCorruption\n\nMemory\nCorruption\n\n\n-----\n\n**[CVE-2020-0796](https://attackerkb.com/topics/2LCXe3EPAZ/cve-2020-0796---smbghost?referrer=2020VTR)**\n\nWindows SMBv3 Client/Server\nRemote Code Execution\n\"SMBGhost\"\n\n\n10 Widespread\nThreat\nExploited in\nthe wild\n\n\nRemote code\nexecution\n\n\nMemory\nCorruption\n\n\n*Kaspersky reported CVE-2020-0986 after they had seen in-the-wild attacks targeting the\nflaw, but said that Microsoft [had already prepared a patch by the time they notified them.

Patch Tuesday protocol\nCVEs instill dread in network security teams, and the infosec zeitgeist is quick to christen\n[protocol vulnerabilities with a variety of “Blue”- and “Bleed”-related nicknames while security](https://github.com/ollypwn/BlueGate)\n[news keeps the term “wormable” fresh in our minds. None of it is unfair, unwarranted, or](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=wormable)\ntechnically incorrect...and yet.\n\n[2020 security headlines trumpeted at least four wormable vulnerabilities in Windows](https://www.google.com/search?q=wormable&biw=1533&bih=901&source=lnt&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F2020%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F2020&tbm=nws)\nnetworking protocols, as well as a smattering of others across major vendors. Despite the\nnotoriety these bugs commanded, the prophesied worms failed to materialize, and with the\nexception of “SMBGhost” (as mentioned earlier, even this distinction is dubious), not one has\nseen exploitation at scale. Why?\n\nMost any vulnerability can be exploited given sufficient skill, opportunity, and motivation. But\ncertain bugs are much more difficult to trigger and weaponize reliably. We’re speaking, of\ncourse, of memory corruption vulnerabilities, the wild child of the vulnerability research world\n[and the target of famous exploits like ETERNALBLUE and (to a much lesser extent)](https://risksense.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/White-Paper_Eternal-Blue.pdf)\nBlueKeep. Memory corruption is a large category of vulnerabilities that involves the misuse\nof data to alter memory and cause unexpected behavior. The overarching memory corruption\ncategory also contains more granular vulnerability types like stack and heap buffer overflows,\ntype confusion, and use-after-free (UAFs).\n\nWhen exploited successfully, memory corruption vulnerabilities can result in arbitrary code\nexecution, or else in unhandled exceptions that cause an application to crash, triggering a\ndenial of service (DoS) condition. The former is more frequently seen in local attacks, while\nthe latter figures more prominently in remote attacks against internet-accessible targets. In\n[recent years, broad adoption of safeguards has significantly complicated exploitation of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization#Kernel_address_space_layout_randomization)\nmemory corruption vulnerabilities. As a result, developing successful attacks takes skill and\n[often requires manual secondary reconnaissance (e.g., finding a heap or kernel memory leak](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/12283)\n\n\n-----\n\nto execute an exploit successfully), which limits utility at scale. Even when a memory\ncorruption exploit is successful at scale—i.e., ETERNALBLUE—reliability is likely to remain a\nchallenge.\n\nOn the other hand, exploits written for memory corruption vulns have a few compelling\nadvantages over easier-to-develop attacks. Arbitrary code execution within a process or\nother memory space conceals malicious code better and leaves fewer artifacts (e.g.,\ntouching disk, spawning new processes), which translates to better operational security for\nmalicious actors. These types of vulnerabilities are also likely to be present in targets straight\nout of the box, frequently in base-level functionality that doesn’t require authentication or\n[separate installation. Take October’s “Bad Neighbor” vulnerability (CVE-2020-16898), for](https://attackerkb.com/topics/17lFRTT1DO/cve-2020-16898-aka-bad-neighbor-ping-of-death-redux?referrer=2020VTR#rapid7-analysis)\nexample: The CVE affected all versions of Windows by default without needing to account\nfor configuration—uniform attack surface area even if exploitation is finickier.\n\nIt’s not surprising that “Bad Neighbor,” “BlueGate,” “SigRed,” and several more of the\nyear’s high-profile CVEs never saw the release of highly effective public tools, or in\nmany cases, any public tooling whatsoever. Turning memory corruption DoS actions\ninto fully weaponized remote code execution is non-trivial.\n\nBut even in the absence of public tooling, it would be surprising—to the point of near\nimpossibility—if fully weaponized exploits for these types of bugs weren’t developed\nprivately.\n\nState-sponsored actors and other sophisticated attackers typically aren’t resourceconstrained the way in-house researchers at security firms or other corporate environments\nare. Neither, to a lesser degree, are vulnerability developers who sell zero-day exploits to the\nhighest bidder—either directly or through brokers who act as a black box for both sides of the\ntransaction. With that in mind, it’s understandable that a number of 2020’s memory\ncorruption vulnerabilities saw exploitation by state-sponsored actors, whether they were\ndisclosed as zero-days or included in intelligence agency communications about foreign\nadversary operations months after their release. Oracle Solaris CVE-2020-14871 and\nWindows kernel CVE-2020-0986 both fit the former description, while SigRed (CVE-20201350) and Cisco IOS XR CVE-2020-3118 fit the latter. The IOS XR vulnerability is a fantastic\nexample of a bug that is entirely impractical at scale—successful exploitation requires an\n[attacker to be on the local area network, directly attached to the vulnerable switch—but is](https://attackerkb.com/assessments/55a38808-b356-444b-a8a7-e3dd9a89a7be)\nevidently a bit more useful to state-sponsored threat actors.\n\nWe will see more of these types of bugs in 2021; we may even see more high-severity\nmemory corruption bugs in Windows network protocols. While we share the security\ncommunity’s concern in many of these cases, “patch but don’t panic” remains a good mantra\nto live by.\n\nClicks and likes may be reasonable metrics for notoriety, but they’re poor proxies for\ntrue risk.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Spotlight: Operational Technology\n\n\n-----\n\n## Spotlight: Operational Technology Securing Physical Systems in a\n\n\n-----\n\n## Digital World\n\n_The following section was written by the SCADAfence research team. SCADAfence is a_\n_global leader in securing operational technology (OT) and Internet of Things (IoT) networks_\n_[for enterprises, industrial organizations, and critical infrastructure. Learn more here.](https://www.scadafence.com/)_\n\n2020 witnessed a number of high-severity vulnerabilities that threatened OT and industrial\nnetworks and underlined the challenges of deeply embedded, often customized\nimplementations of vulnerable technologies. But 2020’s vulnerability suites, imbued with\n[catchy names, aren’t the first potential threats to highlight growing risk across an industry](https://attackerkb.com/topics/UBfm95fV8w/amnesia-33)\n[segment that’s been caught in the middle of some of the world’s](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-12-03/merck-cyberattack-s-1-3-billion-question-was-it-an-act-of-war) [largest cyberattacks.](https://www.wired.com/2016/12/botnet-broke-internet-isnt-going-away/)\n\nFirst, some history: Operational technology (OT) systems are computer-operated systems\nthat control physical and often critical processes. Many of these systems date back decades,\nand it was evident rather quickly that OT environments were not ready for the internet age.\nThe initial response was to air-gap these systems by disconnecting all network connectivity.\nAs it turns out, however, that approach was rather impractical. OT companies needed many\nof the benefits of connectivity to help them stay updated and competitive—benefits like\nimproved monitoring and logistics, remote support, software updates, the ability to develop\nnew connected product offerings, and so on.\n\nOT asset owners, therefore, had to address the challenges of minimizing risk in an\nincreasingly connected world. Legacy systems are still widely deployed in operational\ntechnology environments, the majority of which have not been designed with security in\nmind. It’s an inescapable truth that large numbers of vulnerabilities exist in virtually every\ndeployed OT system—from heavy equipment and industrial routers to internet-facing portals\nand common software libraries. These vulnerabilities affect millions of devices and hundreds\nof vendors, and are frequently difficult to mitigate or even identify across individual vendor\nimplementations.\n\n## The Modern OT Threat Landscape\n\n[Threats to operational technology environments today include common and targeted](https://www.scadafence.com/resource/anatomy-of-a-targeted-ransomware-attack/)\n[ransomware along with targeted campaigns like Trisis or the](https://www.iotworldtoday.com/2019/04/11/trisis-malware-discovered-at-additional-industrial-facility/) [2015 attack on the Ukrainian](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-cyber-attack-energy-idUSKBN1521BA)\npower grid. In 2020, OT and IoT vendors also found themselves responding to a variety of\nvulnerabilities in common low-level software libraries—namely, common TCP/IP libraries\nshared by many vendors and products. These groups of CVEs, named Ripple20 and\nAmnesia:33, pose a challenge to both vendors tasked with developing fixes and OT\norganizations tasked with reducing risk. Vendor and supply chain fragmentation means that\nvery often, millions of devices are affected by these CVEs, and the full list of vulnerable\nproducts and vendors may be populated over the course of months or years.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhenever there are new vulnerabilities in shared libraries, the level of exploitability varies\nfrom device to device; as you might imagine, this creates quite a lot of confusion and adds\nanother layer of complexity to the already complex industrial vulnerabilities space. Earlier this\nyear, SCADAfence researchers tested one of the more severe Ripple20 vulnerabilities in our\nlab. CVE-2020-11898 has a CVSS score of 9.1 (critical) and can potentially allow remote\nattackers to read sensitive information. After testing on multiple devices that were reported\nvulnerable by their vendors, we found the vulnerability to be non-exploitable.\n\nSCADAfence researchers also tested the exploitability of several of the more serious\nAmnesia:33 vulnerabilities and determined that exploitation was extremely unlikely outside of\nspecific, tailor-made attack scenarios, since implementations vary from device to device.\nFurthermore, of the four remote code execution vulnerabilities released as part of the\nAmnesia:33 research, three of them reside in the way DNS domain names are encoded and\nthe way DNS response packets are processed; another arises from the way IPv6 ICMP echo\npackets are processed. Why is this relevant? Because compared to other industries, it’s\n_much less common for OT environments to use DNS over hard-coded IP addresses, and_\nmost devices these days—especially OT networks—use IPv4 over IPv6.\n\nThere were, however, several vulnerabilities published in 2020 that do pose an active threat\nto OT environments and industrial organizations. Perhaps the most important set of 2020\n[vulnerabilities are CVE-2020-7486 and CVE-2020-7491, both of which affect Schneider](https://blog.scadafence.com/similarities-between-stuxnet-and-latest-vulnerabilities-found-in-schneider-triconex-sis-controllers)\nElectric Triconex SIS devices. SIS (Safety Instrumented Systems) are critical process\ncontrols used to prevent disasters, like fires or explosions, in industrial environments. In July\n2020, CISA in the U.S. [warned that these vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely and with](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-205-01)\nlittle skill. The same day, CISA and the NSA [issued a joint alert recommending immediate](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-205a)\nactions to reduce exposure across OT and control systems.\n\n## OT Security Guidance\n\nWhile asset owners often have comprehensive asset inventories of Windows endpoints,\nservers, and other devices, there is a large visibility gap when it comes to OT devices. This\ngap means that asset owners are not able to feed necessary information into their\norganizations’ vulnerability management processes—information that includes\ncomprehensive details on vendors, device models, versions, and network exposure.\nManaging risk is difficult if not impossible without an understanding of attack surface area\nintroduced by OT devices.\n\nWhenever critical vulnerabilities are published, and especially when they are known to be\nexploited, asset owners should perform assessments to determine the potential impact of the\nvulnerability and the organization’s possible exposure. Some asset owners may also base\ntheir impact analyses solely on CVSS scores, but these can be misleading and lead to\ninefficient prioritization.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt helps when organizations are aware of common-sense facts when evaluating research or\nnews articles on vulnerabilities affecting OT and IoT devices. Organizations that don’t\naccount for mitigating factors, such as uncommon configurations or unlikely attack scenarios,\nhave a higher chance of investing resources in activities that don’t end up reducing their risk.\n\nAsset owners should also consider adopting automated tools that assist in the identification,\nprioritization, and remediation of OT vulnerabilities, in support of an OT vulnerability\nmanagement program. Ideally, tooling should help OT network managers understand the\nsize of their attack surface area and the probability of exploitation; this may include\nautomated asset inventories, vulnerability correlation engines, and/or network exposure\nanalyzers. For more information about this topic, please refer to the SCADAfence OT\nVulnerability Management guide, which doubles as a comprehensive guide to industrial\ndevice patching.\n\n## Guidance for Defenders\n\n\n-----\n\n## G id f D f d K T k F 2020 Th t\n\n\n-----\n\n## Responses\n\nThe tried-and-true pieces of guidance in this section have impeded exploitation for many of\nthe vulnerabilities in this report and aided defenders in more quickly identifying signs of\ncompromise or suspicious activity. We recognize that advice is rarely one-size-fits-all, and\nthat security program maturity varies widely even among organizations of the same size,\nindustry, and market cap. Nevertheless, the following suggestions encapsulate learnings that\nwill apply to future threats as well as the specific risks highlighted in this paper:\n\n**Patch early and as often as possible, even when widespread exploitation isn’t**\n**seen.**\n\nWhen severe vulnerabilities are exploited within hours or days of publication, patching should\nbe performed on an emergency basis, if possible. It is also wise to monitor for suspicious\nbehavior and events in addition to fine-tuning intrusion detection and prevention systems.\nRelying on common rules and signatures alone is inadvisable during critical situations, as\n[attackers routinely find ways to evade them. F5 BIG-IP CVE-2020-5902 is a fine example of](https://attackerkb.com/topics/evLpPlZf0i/cve-2020-5902-tmui-rce-vulnerability?referrer=2020VTR)\nthis.\n\nSeveral of the highest-severity vulnerabilities in this report weren’t widely exploited until\nweeks or months after their publication (e.g., Zerologon, SMBghost, Microsoft Exchange\nServer CVE-2020-0688). Wherever possible, implementing a 30-day patch cycle will help\nprotect against attacks with a longer tail, especially from commodity attackers who operate\non economies of scale (e.g., botnet operators, ransomware campaigns, your everyday script\nkiddies, and so on).\n\n**Defense in depth is a more effective strategy than patching alone.**\n\nSkilled attackers are resourceful and, at times, utterly opportunistic. They can and will\nuse any tool—any technique, any weakness, any piece of information—to build\nsuccessful attack chains. Patches are not always effective, either, as evidenced by\n[CVE-2020-14882 and](https://attackerkb.com/topics/sb4F8UT5zu/cve-2020-14882-unauthenticated-rce-in-console-component-of-oracle-weblogic-server?referrer=2020VTR) [CVE-2020-16875, which saw repeated patch bypasses.](https://attackerkb.com/topics/Y2azzfAbid/cve-2020-16875?referrer=2020VTR)\n\nAdditionally, many of the CVEs treated individually in this report can be used in concert\nwith one or more additional vulnerabilities to achieve something beyond the scope of a\nsingle CVE’s impact. Defenders can get ahead of future attacks by taking care not to\ntreat individual vulnerabilities as if they existed in a vacuum, but instead choosing to\nimplement controls and detection mechanisms across the whole of their environment.\n\nFinally, ensuring that (preferably aggregated) logging is set up across networks and hosts will\nsave some time during active threat events. There are several community-driven signature\nrepositories and low-cost (or free!) rulesets that can give defenders at least basic visibility\n\n\n-----\n\ninto potential intrusions in their environments, along with a plethora of commercial solutions.\nKnowing ahead of time what kind of visibility defenders have into suspicious events will drive\nfaster and more effective response during critical situations.\n\n**Keep an up-to-date inventory list that emphasizes assets or products that sit on**\n**the perimeter and/or may be used as pivot points for external attackers to gain**\n**access to the internal network.**\n\nUnderstanding attack surface area and critical network entry points saves time when severe\nvulnerabilities surface in internet-facing technologies. Pay particular attention to security\ngateway products such as VPNs and firewalls, as well as anything else that’s exposed by\ncommon practice or necessity. [CVE-2019-19781 and](https://attackerkb.com/topics/x22buZozYJ/cve-2019-19781?referrer=2020VTR) [CVE-2020-0688 are noteworthy](https://attackerkb.com/topics/XbYcn2Mckk/cve-2020-0688---exchange-control-panel-viewstate-deserialization-bug?referrer=2020VTR)\nexamples.\n\nManagement and administrative interfaces should never be exposed to the public internet.\nThe same goes for domain controllers and any other assets that organizations would not\nwant an external attacker to be able to probe, such as IoT devices unwittingly exposed\nonline. Audit internet-exposed attack surface area regularly, including via external\npenetration tests, if possible.\n\nAt Rapid7, we believe that research-driven context on vulnerabilities and emergent threats is\ncritical to building forward-looking security programs and advancing community knowledge.\nSecurity and IT teams face mounting challenges in a heightened threat climate, and we are\ncommitted to partnering with those teams to foster deeper understanding of defense-in-depth\nstrategies that will strengthen organizations’ security posture both now and in the future.\n\nFor more information on the vulnerabilities featured in this report, and for Rapid7 and\n[community analysis of new vulnerabilities and threats, keep an eye on AttackerKB. If you](https://attackerkb.com/)\nwish to follow updates on specific CVEs or add assessments of your own, you can create an\naccount using GitHub.\n\n## Appendix\n\n Why These CVEs?\n\nContext is king when analyzing vulnerabilities, just as it is when managing them. Our\ninvestigations into root cause, exploitability, and potential attack vectors often start the same\nway as conversations among security stakeholders—with a vendor advisory that pops a red\nflag, a bit of private intel from a friend, a tweet thread, or a news article. To put it simply, the\nvulnerabilities in this report piqued our interest, as much for the community’s reaction to them\nas for any bona fide threats that emerged. Notably, they also affect software and systems\nrelied upon by many, from enterprises to end users. This dataset does not include all CVEs\nor even all active threats we evaluated in 2020, but it does represent a diverse sample of\nattacker use cases and exploitation case studies\n\n\n-----\n\nOf course, our intent is not to imply that any one CVE or vulnerability group is less important\nthan others. Security teams, network administrators, and defenders at large have in-depth\nunderstanding of which assets are critical in their environments and how action taken may\naffect their business priorities. What we offer is an attacker-centric view of the vulnerability\nlandscape that Rapid7 customers and the security community can use to inform the policies\nand practices that they employ as part of a larger defense-in-depth strategy.\n\n## Notes on Methodology\n\nCVEs featured in this report are from 2020 with two exceptions: Telerik UI CVE-2019-18935\nand Citrix NetScaler ADC/Gateway CVE-2019-19781, both of which were published late in\n2019 and saw sustained exploitation throughout 2020.\n\n[Since the trustworthiness of our data is important, we cite primary sources wherever possible](https://umb.libguides.com/PrimarySources/secondary)\nfor vulnerabilities we’ve listed as exploited in the wild—that is, we reference firsthand\naccounts of exploitation from the organizations or individuals who detected, verified, and\nreported them. Examples of primary sources referenced throughout this paper include U.S.\nintelligence agency alerts of advanced persistent threat (APT) exploitation; security firm\nanalyses of threats and IOCs they’ve tracked during incident response or other\ninvestigations; and vendor advisories that specify exploitation in the wild (this includes CVEs\nthat are disclosed as zero-days). In the interest of readability, when firsthand reports of\nexploitation are disparate and varied, we will occasionally cite an article in a security news\npublication that aggregates those accounts.\n\nThe CVEs we have categorized as exploited in the wild in this report are not the only\nvulnerabilities actively exploited during the 2020 calendar year. For example, we have\nexcluded a number of other exploited bugs in Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Firefox. Google\n[Project Zero has a spreadsheet of some other zero-days exploited in the wild in 2020 here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkNJ0uQwbeC1ZTRrxdtuPLCIl7mlUreoKfSIgajnSyY/edit#gid=1869060786)\n\n## Glossary of Terms\n\n Attacker Utilities\n\n**Remote code execution (RCE): Code execution on a remote target. Typically refers to the**\nability to execute a payload on a target system (e.g., obtain a shell session). Aids in\ncredential stealing, data exfiltration, and so on.\n\n**Local code execution: The ability to run code locally on a system to which the attacker**\nalready has some access. Most commonly used to escalate privileges (e.g., by executing\ncode as the user running the vulnerable application).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Network infrastructure compromise: Compromise of networked infrastructure, such as a**\nnetwork management system or backup system, that may give an attacker access to\neverything managed by that software. Vulnerabilities in virtualization, automation, and/or\ndevice management infrastructure all fall into this category.\n\n**Network pivot: The ability to pivot from an external network to an internal network, most**\noften by exploiting internet-facing systems such as VPNs, firewalls, routers, and other\ngateway devices. A network pivot gives an attacker visibility into both internal and external\ntraffic and aids in data exfiltration, traffic sniffing, and further attacks within the target\nnetwork.\n\n**File enumeration: The ability to enumerate files on a target. File reads do not give an**\nattacker a path to code execution by themselves, but instead function as primitives that allow\nattackers to gather information that enables a secondary part of an exploit chain (e.g.,\nremote code execution). Can aid in turning a post-authentication vulnerability into a preauthentication vulnerability.\n\n## Vulnerability Classes\n\n**Deserialization is the process through which an application is able to convert data from a**\nportable format to data types native to its own language. Many modern languages support\ndeserialization, including Java, .NET, Python, and Ruby. The deserialization process can\npose a threat to security when the data that is loaded into the native language can be\ntampered with by a malicious party. Typical attacks involve configuring the data to invoke a\nmethod with the arguments necessary to execute an operating system command. This\nresults in command execution in the context of the loading application. Common solutions to\nthis security problem include cryptographically signing the data to ensure its authenticity and\nutilizing an allowlist of data types that are permitted to be loaded. Associated CWEs: CWE502.\n\n**Improper Access Control refers to a missing or insufficient access control to a particular**\ninterface into a system (most often a remotely accessible API). Improper uses of\ncryptography for the purpose of authentication also fall under this vulnerability class.\nCommon solutions to this problem include proper authentication, authorization, and\naccounting implementations for all sensitive interfaces, as well as secure management of all\nrelated secrets. A non-exhaustive list of associated CWEs: CWE-285, CWE-200, CWE-287,\nCWE-732.\n\n**Memory Corruption is a large category of vulnerabilities that involve the misuse of data**\nthrough a variety of means to alter memory and produce unexpected behavior. This\nvulnerability class includes improper boundary enforcement, type confusion, uninitialized\ndata use, and the use of data after it has been freed, to name a few. These vulnerabilities\noften manifest themselves in languages that are not considered \"type-safe.” Successful\nexploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities can result in arbitrary code execution within\n\n\n-----\n\nthe context of the running application, or in an unhandled exception that causes the\napplication to crash and triggers a denial of service (DoS) condition. Common solutions to\nthis problem typically involve additional validation on parameters to key operations, such as\nthose used to load and store data. Successful exploitation of these classes of vulnerabilities\nhas become more complex in recent years due to the variety of countermeasures and\nsafeguards that have been developed, such as kASLR, Control Flow Guard, win32k Type\nIsolation, and so on. A non-exhaustive list of associated CWEs: CWE-787, CWE-125, CWE416, CWE-190, CWE-476.\n\n**Injection is a large category of vulnerabilities involving specially crafted input that is**\ninterpreted in a particular way by an associated system. Most commonly seen in web\napplications, injection attacks are often more specifically labeled by the type of data being\ninterpreted (e.g., SQL, LDAP, OS commands). The root cause of these vulnerabilities is\nalmost always insufficient sanitization on data received from a malicious party. Exploitation of\nthese vulnerabilities tends to be reliable, rarely resulting in service degradation unless\nintended (such as through SQL or OS commands).\n\nThe context under which the logic is executed typically depends on how it is interpreted. In\nthe case of a web application, for example, SQL injection may be executed on a back-end\ndatabase server, while OS commands are injected on the front-end web server, and\nJavaScript is executed by the end user’s browser. This class of vulnerabilities is therefore\nunique in that it commonly involves a vulnerability in one system compromising the integrity\nof others. Common solutions to this problem typically involve implementing strict sanitization\non parameters though the use of allowlists. A non-exhaustive list of associated CWEs: CWE79, CWE-20, CWE-89, CWE-94.\n\n## Full
