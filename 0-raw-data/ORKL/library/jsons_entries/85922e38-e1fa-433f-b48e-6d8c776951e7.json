All the artifacts had\nvery low Anti-Virus (AV) detection rates on VirusTotal when they were first\nsubmitted.\nAt the time of the discovery, the C2 infrastructure hosted in France was still live.\nThe campaign used NATO’s upcoming trainings as a lure.\nThe campaign targeted a specific government body in Azerbaijan, however; it is\nlikely that attackers also targeted NATO members or other countries involved in\nNATO exercises.\nAnalysis revealed interesting correlations with ReconHell/BlackWater attack, which\n[we uncovered in August.](https://quointelligence.eu/2020/08/blackwater-malware-leveraging-beirut-tragedy-in-new-targeted-campaign/)\nAs part of our responsible disclosure, we reported our findings to French authorities\nfor taking down the C2, and to NATO for their awareness.\n\n## Introduction\n\nOn 9 August, QuoIntelligence disseminated a Warning to its government customers about\na new APT28 (aka Sofacy, Sednit, Fancy Bear, STRONTIUM, etc.) campaign targeting\n[government bodies of NATO members (or countries cooperating with NATO). In](https://www.nato.int/)\nparticular, we found a malicious file uploaded to VirusTotal, which ultimately drops a\nZebrocy malware and communicates with a C2 in France. After our discovery, we\nreported the malicious C2 to the French law enforcement as part of our responsible\ndisclosure process.\n\nZebrocy is a malware used by APT28 (also known as Sofacy), which was reported by\nmultiple security firms[1][2][3][4][5][6] in the last two years.\n\nFinally, our investigation concluded that the attack started on 5 August and targeted at\nleast a government entity located in the Middle East. However, it is highly likely that\nNATO members also observed the same attack.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n**File Name** Course 5 – 16 October 2020.zipx\n\n\n-----\n\n**File Name** Course 5 – 16 October 2020.zipx\n\n**SHA256** **e6e19633ba4572b49b47525b5a873132d-**\n## feb432f075fbba29831f1bc59d5885d\n\n\n**First Submis-**\n**sion to VT**\n\n**First AV de-**\n**tetction rate**\n\n\n2020-08-05T12:28:27\n\nReally Low (3/61)\n\n\nAt a first look, the sample seems to be a valid JPEG image file:\n\nIn fact, if the file is renamed as a JPG, the Operating System will show the logo of the\n[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), which is the NATO’s Allied](https://shape.nato.int/)\nCommand Operations (ACO) located in Belgium.\n\nHowever, further analysis revealed the sample as having a Zip file concatenated. This\ntechnique works because JPEG files are parsed from the beginning of the file and some\nZip implementations parse Zip files from the end of the file (since the index is located\nthere) without looking at the signature in the front.\n\nThe technique is also used by threat actors to evade AVs, or other filtering systems since\nthey might mistake the file for a JPEG and skip it. Interestingly, in order to trigger the\ndecompression of the file on Windows after the user clicks on it, the following conditions\nneed to be met: a) the file must be correctly named .zip(x); b) the file needs to be opened\nwith WinRAR. The file will show an error message claiming it is corrupted if the targeted\nvictim uses WinZip or the default Windows utility.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter decompressing the appended ZIP file, the following two samples are dropped:\n\nCourse 5 – 16 October 2020.exe (Zebrocy malware)                 SHA256:\naac3b1221366cf7e4421bdd555d0bc33d4b92d6f65fa58c1bb4d8474db883fec\n\nCourse 5 – 16 October 2020.xls (Corrupted file)                        SHA256:\nb45dc885949d29cba06595305923a0ed8969774dae995f0ce5b947b5ab5fe185\n\nConsidering the lure uses a NATO image, the attackers likely picked the filenames in\n[order to leverage upcoming NATO courses in October 2020. Additionally, the Excel file](https://www.natoschool.nato.int/Academics/Portfolio/Course-Catalogue#2aid-aid)\n(XLS) is corrupted and cannot be opened by Microsoft Excel, it contains – what seems to\nbe – information about military personnel involved in the military mission “African\nUnion Mission for Somalia”. The long list of information includes names, ranks, unit,\narrival/leave dates, and more.\n\nTo note, QuoIntelligence was not able to determine if the information contained in the file\nis legitimate or not.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the hypotheses explaining the corrupted file is an intentional tactic of the attacker.\nThe rationale could be that the attacker makes the user attempt to first open the XLS file,\nand then open the .exe with the same filename as a second try. The .exe file has a PDF\nicon, so if file extensions are not shown, targeted users might be lured into opening the\nexecutable.\n\n**File Name** Course 5 – 16 October 2020.exe\n\n**SHA256** **aac3b1221366cf7e4421bdd555d0bc33d4b92d6f65-**\n## fa58c1bb4d8474db883fec\n\n\n**First Submis-**\n**sion to VT**\n\n**First AV detec-**\n**tion rate**\n\n\n2020-08-05T18:33:39\n\nReally Low (9/70)\n\n\n[The sample analyzed is a Delphi executable. Since 2015, multiple researchers have](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/24/sednit-update-analysis-zebrocy/)\nalready covered Zebrocy Delphi versions in-depth. Interestingly, last Zebrocy\n[observations seemed to suggest a discontinuity of the Delphi versions in favor of a new](https://securelist.com/zebrocys-multilanguage-malware-salad/90680/)\n[one written in Go language.](https://securelist.com/a-zebrocy-go-downloader/89419/)\n\n## Behavior Analysis\n\nOnce executed, the sample copies itself into\n%AppData%\\Roaming\\Service\\12345678\\sqlservice.exe by adding 160 random bytes to\nthe new file. This padding is used to evade hash-matching security controls, since the\ndropped malware will always have a different file hash value.\n\nNext, the malware creates a new scheduled task, and it is executed with the /s parameter\n\nThe task runs regularly and tries to POST stolen data (e.g. screenshots) to\nhxxp://194.32.78[.]245/protect/get-upd-id[.]php\n\n\n-----\n\nAt a first glance, the data seems to be obfuscated and encrypted. Another request looks\nlike this:\n\nThe heading number 12345678 (the original eight digits were redacted) seems to be\nconstant, suggesting its use as a unique ID of the infected machine. Notably, the same\nnumber is also used by the malware while creating the folder that contains sqlservice.exe\n\nLetting the sample talk to its actual C2 on the Internet did not change its actual behavior\nduring our analysis. The malware sends POST requests about once per minute without\ngetting a response back. Additionally, the server closes the connection after waiting for\nabout 10 more seconds. It is possible that this unresponsive behavior is due to the C2\ndetermining the infected machine as not interesting.\n\nLastly, the network traffic generated to the C2 triggers the following Emerging Threats\n(ET) IDS rule:\n\nET TROJAN Zebrocy Screenshot Upload” (SID: 2030122)\n\n## Victimology and Attribution\n\nQuoIntelligence concludes with medium-high confidence that the campaign targeted a\nspecific government body, at _least in Azerbaijan. Although Azerbaijan is not a NATO_\nmember, it closely cooperates with the North-Atlantic organizations and participates in\nNATO exercises. Further, the same campaign very likely targeted other NATO members\nor countries cooperating with NATO exercises.\n\nBy analyzing the Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), the targeting, and the theme\nused as a lure, we have high confidence in attributing this attack to the well-known\nAPT28/Zebrocy TTPs disclosed by the security community in the last year.\n\n\n-----\n\n## An Interesting Coincidence?\n\nAlthough we could not find any strong causation link yet or solid technical link between\nthe two attacks, it should be noted the following points correlating with the ReconHellcat\n[campaign we uncovered on August 11:](https://quointelligence.eu/2020/08/blackwater-malware-leveraging-beirut-tragedy-in-new-targeted-campaign/)\n\nBoth the compressed Zebrocy malware and the OSCE-themed lure used to drop the\nBlackWater backdoor were uploaded the same day, on 5 August.\nBoth samples were uploaded by the same user in Azerbaijan and are highly likely by\nthe same organization.\nBoth attacks happened in the same timeframe.\nOSCE and NATO are both organizations that have been targeted (directly or\nindirectly) by APT28 in the past.\nThe victimology we identified for the ReconHellcat campaign is in line with the one\ntargeted by the Zebrocy attack (i.e. similar type of government bodies). The type of\norganizations targeted by both attacks is also in line with known APT28\nvictimology.\nWe assessed ReconHellcat as a high-capability APT group, like APT28.\n\n## Citations\n\n[[1] ESET, A1, April 2018, Sednit update: Analysis of Zebrocy](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/24/sednit-update-analysis-zebrocy/)\n\n[[2] Palo Alto, B1, June 2018, Sofacy Group’s Parallel Attacks](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-sofacy-groups-parallel-attacks/)\n\n[[3] Kaspersky, A1, October 2018, Shedding Skin – Turla’s Fresh Faces](https://securelist.com/shedding-skin-turlas-fresh-faces/88069/)\n\n[[4] Kaspersky, A1, Janurary 2019, A Zebrocy Go Downloader](https://securelist.com/a-zebrocy-go-downloader/89419/)\n\n[[5] Kaspersky, A1, January 2019, GreyEnergy’s overlap with Zebrocy](https://securelist.com/greyenergys-overlap-with-zebrocy/89506/)\n\n[[6] Kaspersky, A1, June 2019, Zebrocy’s Multilanguage Malware](https://securelist.com/zebrocys-multilanguage-malware-salad/90680/)\n\n## Appendix I – IOCs\n\nhxxp://194.32.78.245/protect/get-upd-id.php\n\n**Course 5 – 16 October 2020.zipx**\n\n6e89e098816f3d353b155ab0f3377fe3eb3951f45f8c34c4a48c5b61cd8425aa\n\n**Course 5 – 16 October 2020.xls (Corrupted file)**\n\n\n-----\n\nb45dc885949d29cba06595305923a0ed8969774dae995f0ce5b947b5ab5fe185\n\n**Course 5 – 16 October 2020.exe (Zebrocy malware)**\n\naac3b1221366cf7e4421bdd555d0bc33d4b92d6f65fa58c1bb4d8474db883fec\n\n**Additional Zebrocy malware variants on VT**\n\nfae335a465bb9faac24c58304a199f3bf9bb1b0bd07b05b18e2be6b9e90d72e6\n\neb81c1be62f23ac7700c70d866e84f5bc354f88e6f7d84fd65374f84e252e76b\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK\n\n**TACTIC** **TECHNIQUE**\n\n**Execution** [T1047: Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/)\n\n\n**Defense**\n**Evasion**\n\n\n[T1140: Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140/)\n\n\n**Discovery** [T1083: File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/)\n[T1135: Network Share Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1135/)\n[T1120: Peripheral Device Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1120/)\n[T1057: Process Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1057/)\n[T1012: Query Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012/)\n[T1082: System Information Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)\n[T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/)\n[T1049: System Network Connections Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1049/)\n[T1033: System Owner/User Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033/)\n[T1124: System Time Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1124/)\n\n**Collection** [T1560: Archive Collected Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/)\n[T1119: Automated Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119/)\n[T1113: Screen Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1113/)\n\n\n**Command**\n**and Control**\n\n\n[T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/)\n\n\n**Exfiltration** [T1041: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/)\n\nDo you want to stay informed of cyber and geopolitical threats targeting your\norganization?
