    "plain_text": "# Global Operations Lead to Arrests of Alleged Members of GandCrab/REvil and Cl0p Cartels\n\n**[trendmicro.com/en_in/research/21/k/global-operations-lead-to-arrests-of-alleged-members-of-gandcrab.html](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_in/research/21/k/global-operations-lead-to-arrests-of-alleged-members-of-gandcrab.html)**\n\nNovember 16, 2021\n\nA total of 13 suspects believed to be members of two prolific cybercrime rings were arrested\nas a global coalition across five continents involving law enforcement and private partners,\n[including Trend Micro, sought to crack down on big ransomware operators.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/definition/ransomware)\n\nAbout the GandCrab/REvil arrests\n\n[According to a report by Interpol, the global operation, which was done by 19 law](https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2021/Joint-global-ransomware-operation-sees-arrests-and-criminal-network-dismantled)\nenforcement agencies in 17 countries, led to the apprehension of seven suspects linked as\n“affiliates” or partners of GandCrab/REvil. The group is a prominent ransomware network\ndeemed responsible for more than 7,000 attacks since early 2019.\n\nCode-named Quicksand (GoldDust), the operation was a collaboration between Interpol,\nEuropol, law enforcement agencies, and private firms. Each contributed to the four-year-long\ninvestigations by sharing information and technical expertise.\n\n[REvil (aka Sodinokibi) and GandCrab, believed to be manned by the same individuals,](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti)\n[peddle ransomware-as-a-service (Raas), renting out ransomware code to other](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/definition/ransomware-as-a-service-raas)\ncybercriminals. Set up with groups known as affiliates, the scheme includes intrusions into\ncompanies, deployment of ransomware, and demand for ransom, after which profits are\nshared with the rest of the coders.\n\n\n-----\n\nA [report by Europol estimates that over €200 million in ransom demands had been made](https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/five-affiliates-to-sodinokibi/revil-unplugged)\ncollectively since 2019 by the seven suspects from all the attacks that were carried out.\n\nThe formidable global coalition enabled the following:\n\nKorean law enforcement’s arrest of three suspects in February, April, and October\nKuwaiti authorities’ arrest of a man who allegedly carried out ransomware attacks using\nthe GandCrab ransomware\nRomanian authorities’ arrest of two individuals suspected of ransomware cyberattacks\nand linked to more than 5,000 infections and half a million euros in ransom payments\nThe arrest of a man suspected of deploying the Kaseya ransomware attack, thought to\nhave been done in July 2021 by the REvil group with more than 1,500 people and\n1,000 businesses affected worldwide\n\nTrend Micro’s monitoring of GandCrab/REvil\n\nTrend Micro has kept a close eye on this malware family since as early as 2018, when we\nreported the [discovery of GandCrab v4.3, which targeted South Korean users through spam](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/-egg-files-in-spam-delivers-gandcrab-v4-3-ransomware-to-south-korean-users)\nemails. The spam emails used EGG (.egg) files to deliver the GandCrab v4.3 ransomware\n(detected by Trend Micro as Ransom_GANDCRAB.TIAOBHO). EGG is a compressed\narchive file format (similar to ZIP) that is commonly used in South Korea. Evidence indicated\nthat the attack was aimed toward South Korean users for its use of Hangul in the subject,\nbody, and attachment file name of the spam emails.\n\n[In 2019, Trend Micro announced another noteworthy GandCrab ransomware attack, also in](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/spam/3676/gandcrab-ransomware-gets-distributed-via-fake-shipping-notification-written-in-korean)\nSouth Korea. Spam emails made the rounds with the subject “SHIPPED ORDER\nINCORRECT.” The messages posed as shipping order notifications from a known courier\ndelivery service company and were designed to dupe the recipients into opening the email\nattachment. As with the first attack, the email body was written in Korean and contained a\nRAR attachment that supposedly contained information on the parcel.\n\nAbout the Cl0p arrest\n\nAnother milestone for the global public-private alliance aimed at dismantling cybercrime rings\nis the arrest of six suspected members of the ransomware group Cl0p, following a 30-month\njoint investigation into attacks against South Korean companies and US academic\ninstitutions.\n\nThe task force, acted on the request by South Korea’s cybercrime investigation division,\nenabled the arrest of alleged gang members in Ukraine. The operation involved Interpol,\nEuropol, and law enforcement authorities in South Korea, Ukraine, and the US in June.\n\nCodenamed Operation Cyclone, it had global police pursuing the Cl0p malware operators in\n[Ukraine for allegedly targeting private businesses in South Korea and the US. Interpol](https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2021/INTERPOL-led-operation-takes-down-prolific-cybercrime-ring)\nreports that Cl0p’s attacks impeded access to their computer files and networks, and\n\n\n-----\n\nsubsequently demanded huge ransoms for restoring access.\n\nThe suspects allegedly facilitated the transfer and cash-out of assets on the ransomware\ngroup’s behalf while threatening to release sensitive data to the public if demands for\nadditional payments were declined. The six suspects are believed to be closely connected to\na Russian-language cybercrime network known for naming and shaming its victims on a Tor\nleak site and, more notably, for amassing more than US$500 million in funds related to\nseveral ransomware attacks. Cl0p’s activities target essential infrastructures and industries,\nsuch as transportation and logistics, education, manufacturing, energy, financial, aerospace,\ntelecommunications, and healthcare.\n\nOperation Cyclone was deployed with assistance and information given by Trend Micro and\nother private cybersecurity firms. The synergy in intelligence gathering enabled the Ukrainian\npolice to search more than 20 houses, businesses, and vehicles, and seize property,\ncomputers, and cash amounting to US$185,000.\n\nTrend Micro’s monitoring of Cl0p\n\n[Trend Micro Research has written extensively about Cl0p and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-recap-clop-deathransom-and-maze-ransomware) [other ransomware actors as it](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti)\nhelps organisations to effectively deal with ransomware attacks.\n\nCl0p (unstylized as Clop) first became known as a variant of the CryptoMix ransomware\n[family. In 2020, the group behind Cl0p publicised the data of a pharmaceutical company in its](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/execupharm-clop-ransomware/)\nmaiden attempt at the double extortion scheme. Since then, the group’s extortion tactics\nhave become increasingly sophisticated and thus more destructive.\n\nOperators hold their target organisation under duress by sending out emails to initiate\nnegotiations. If messages are ignored, they threaten to publicise and auction off stolen data\non the data leak site “Cl0p^_-Leaks”. In addition, Cl0p ransomware operators employ other\n[extortion techniques, such as going after top executives and](https://www.zdnet.com/article/some-ransomware-gangs-are-going-after-top-execs-to-pressure-companies-into-paying/) [customers to pressure](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/116029/cyber-crime/clop-ransomware-extortion.html)\ncompanies to pay up.\n\nDefending networks and systems from ransomware\n\nThwarting ransomware requires collaborative efforts from both law enforcement agencies\nand private companies like cybersecurity vendors. For its part, Trend Micro has been\ncollaborating with law enforcement agencies to provide them with threat intelligence needed\nto aid in their investigations in order to combat ransomware and other cyberthreats.\n\nThere is no doubt that ransomware will persist as a significant security threat, one that is\nexpected to multiply and advance in complexity. As we’ve seen, ransomware rapidly evolves\ninto an even more destructive threat. To protect networks and systems from ransomware,\norganisations and users are advised to follow these best practices:\n\nAvoid downloading attachments and clicking on links in emails from unverified sources.\n\n\n-----\n\nRegularly patch and update operating systems, programs, and software.\n[Periodically back up files by observing the 3-2-1 rule: Create at least three copies of](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/virtualization-and-cloud/best-practices-backing-up-data)\nthe data, store it in two different formats, and keep at least one duplicate off-site.\n[Follow security frameworks such as those set by the Center of Internet Security and](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/)\nthe [National Institute of Standards and Technology to reduce overall risk levels and](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)\nexposure to threats and vulnerabilities that ransomware operators may use.\n\nAs threat actors are always waiting for the opportunity to pounce on the next victim, investing\nin cross-layered detection and response solutions can save organisations a lot of headache\n[and expense. Trend Micro Vision One™ with Managed XDR is a cybersecurity platform that](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_in/business/products/detection-response/managed-xdr-mdr.html)\nprovides visibility into the early activities of modern ransomware attacks to help detect and\nblock ransomware components so that attacks are thwarted even before cybercriminals are\nable to exfiltrate sensitive data.\n\n\n-----",
