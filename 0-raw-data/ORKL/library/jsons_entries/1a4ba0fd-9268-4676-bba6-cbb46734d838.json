Initially, the ransomware was offered as a complete custom build for an\nundisclosed fee. The ransomware is currently Windows-specific and, according to the\ndevelopers, functions on all “supported versions of Windows”.\n\nUnusually, there are no connectivity requirements for the payloads to execute. Zeoticus\nransomware will execute fully offline, with no dependence on a C2 (Command & Control). It\nis also worth noting that the malware is designed not to function in some regions, specifically\n[Russia, Belarus, and Kyrgyzstan. Like many other families, use within the CIS is discouraged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States)\nin order to avoid any backlash from regional government and law enforcement agencies.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Zeoticus Development\n\nSince late 2020 and moving into early 2021, the vendor has continued to maintain and offer\nupdates on the Zeoticus service.\n\nIn December 2020, samples of Zeoticus 2.0 were observed and reported in the wild. Multiple\nresearchers and security vendors began to take notice and analyze these updated samples (\ne.g., tweet from @demonslay335)\n\nA recent public announcement includes updates on file extension-based identification and\nperformance around the prioritization and encryption of extremely large files.\n\n\n-----\n\nMost of the updates in Zeoticus 2.0 are focused on speed and efficiency. Specific encryption\nalgorithms (both symmetric and asymmetric) have been employed based on their speed\n(e.g., [Poly1305 is used for signing the primary encryption key rather than something like](https://cr.yp.to/mac.html)\nSHA1).\n\nOther notable features include compatibility with “all lines of Windows OSs”, with some\nindications that the ransomware will even run on Windows XP and earlier.\n\nThe ransomware also has the ability to discover and infect remote drives and to discover and\nterminate processes that could interfere with the encryption process.\n\n## Execution and Persistence\n\nUpon execution, pertinent files are identified based on extension. The encryptable-extension\nlist is fully customizable and in the control of the attacker.\n\nWhen launched, the malware makes a few copies of itself in the following locations:\n```\nC:Windows\n%AppData%\n\n```\nFollowing this, Zeoticus proceeds to kill off a number of running processes (via\n```\ntaskkill.exe ) as follows:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nsqlagent.exe\nsqlbrowser.exe\nsqlservr.exe\nsqlwriter.exe\noracle.exe\nocssd.exe\ndbsnmp.exe\nsynctime.exe\nmydesktopqos.exe\nagntsvc.exe\nisqlplussvc.exe\nxfssvccon.exe\nmydesktopservice.exe\nocautoupds.exe\nagntsvc.exe\nagntsvc.exe\nagntsvc.exe\nencsvc.exe\nfirefoxconfig.exe\ntbirdconfig.exe\nocomm.exe\nmysqld.exe\nmysqld-nt.exe\nmysqld-opt.exe\ndbeng50.exe\nsqbcoreservice.exe\nexcel.exe\ninfopath.exe\nmsaccess.exe\nmspub.exe\nonenote.exe\noutlook.exe\npowerpnt.exe\nsqlservr.exe\nthebat64.exe\nthunderbird.exe\nwinword.exe\nWordpad.exe\n\n```\nZeoticus utilizes the `ping command to facilitate the deletion of its own binaries, redirecting`\nthe output of the command to `>nul & del to` [achieve this.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20329355/how-to-make-a-batch-file-delete-itself/20329529#20329529)\n\n```\n/c ping localhost -n 3 > nul & del %s\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe following WMI query is then issued to gather additional information about the local\nenvironment:\n```\nstart iwbemservices::execquery - rootcimv2 : select __path, processid, csname,\ncaption, sessionid, threadcount, workingsetsize, kernelmodetime, usermodetime,\nparentprocessid from win32_process where ( caption = \"msftesql.exe\" or caption =\n\"sqlagent.exe\" or caption = \"sqlbrowser.exe\" or caption = \"sqlservr.exe\" or caption =\n\"sqlwriter.exe\" or caption = \"oracle.exe\" or caption = \"ocssd.exe\" or caption =\n\"dbsnmp.exe\" or caption = \"synctime.exe\" or caption = \"mydesktopqos.exe\" or caption =\n\"agntsvc.exe\" or caption = \"isqlplussvc.exe\" or caption = \"xfssvccon.exe\" or caption\n= \"mydesktopservice.exe\" or caption = \"ocautoupds.exe\" or caption = \"agntsvc.exe\" or\ncaption = \"agntsvc.exe\" or caption = \"agntsvc.exe\" or caption = \"encsvc.exe\" or\ncaption = \"firefoxconfig.exe\" or caption = \"tbirdconfig.exe\" or caption = \"ocomm.exe\"\nor caption = \"mysqld.exe\" or caption = \"mysqld-nt.exe\" or caption = \"mysqld-opt.exe\"\nor caption = \"dbeng50.exe\" or caption = \"sqbcoreservice.exe\" or caption = \"excel.exe\"\nor caption = \"infopath.exe\" or caption = \"msaccess.exe\" or caption = \"mspub.exe\" or\ncaption = \"onenote.exe\" or caption = \"outlook.exe\" or caption = \"powerpnt.exe\" or\ncaption = \"sqlservr.exe\" or caption = \"thebat64.exe\" or caption = \"thunderbird.exe\"\nor caption = \"winword.exe\" or caption = \"wordpad.exe\")\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nAll samples analyzed across Zeoticus 1.0 and 2.0 create the Registry Run key to achieve\npersistence:\n\n```\nREGISTRYUSER----SoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun\n\n```\n\nThe registry entry (Run) is set to launch an instance of the Zeoticus payload from\n```\nC:Windows :\n\n## Encryption and Ransom Note\n\n```\n[The ransomware uses a combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption. XChaCha20](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/advanced/stream_ciphers/xchacha20)\n[is utilized on the symmetric side, while the combination of Poly1305,](https://cr.yp.to/mac.html) [XSalsa20 and](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/advanced/stream_ciphers/xsalsa20)\n[Curve25519 is used for the asymmetric side.](https://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html)\n\nEncrypted files are modified with extensions that include the contact email address of the\nattacker(s) along with the string “2020END”, which is no doubt a reference to the new year.\n\nIn parallel with the encryption of the host’s data, Zeoticus mounts a new volume which\ncontains the ransom note. Victims are instructed to contact the attacker via email as opposed\nto using an onion-based payment portal or similar. Additionally, the ransomware will drop a\ncopy of the ransom note to the root of the system drive ( e.g., `C:WINDOWSREADME.html ).`\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThis is one of the more noticeable differences between Zeoticus 2.0 and 1.0. That is, in\nv1.0, the desktop wallpaper was actually altered with the victim instructions as opposed to\nmounting the new volume.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAttackers are continuing to improve upon their techniques and tactics. Active ransomware\ninfections are getting increasingly difficult to control, contain, and mitigate. Prevention of\nthese attacks is more important than ever given the difficulty of recovering from a\ncatastrophic ransomware attack. We encourage all to review their security posture and take\nany necessary steps to improve their protections and reduce their overall exposure. Visibility\nand education go a long way here. A thorough and accurate understanding of the\nenvironment is key in prioritizing controls and reducing risk. It is also important to educate\nend users on the methods used by these attackers, and encourage them to report any\nsuspicious activity they observe. Finally, ensure that all technological controls are installed\nand implemented properly, and are up to date with the latest patches.\n\n## IOCs\n\n**SHA256**\n\n33703e94572bca90070f00105c7008ed85d26610a7083de8f5760525bdc110a6\n\n279d73e673463e42a1f37199a30b3deff6b201b8a7edf94f9d6fb5ce2f9f7f34\n\n**SHA1**\n\n25082dee3a4bc00caf29e806d55ded5e080c05fa\n\nd3449118b7ca870e6b9706f7e2e4e3b2d2764f7b\n\n\n-----\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK**\n[Data from Local System – T1005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005/)\n[Credentials from Password Stores – T1555](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/)\nModify Registry – [T1112](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/)\n[Query Registry – T1012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012/)\n[Remote System Discovery – T1018](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018/)\n[System Information Discovery – T1082](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)\n[Peripheral Device Discovery – T1120](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1120/)\n[Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder – T1547.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/)\nData Encrypted for Impact – [T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)\n\n\n-----",
