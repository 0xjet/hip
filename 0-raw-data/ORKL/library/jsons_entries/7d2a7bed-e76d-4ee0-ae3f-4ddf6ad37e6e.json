    "plain_text": "# SpyEye Targets Opera, Google Chrome Users\n\n**[krebsonsecurity.com/2011/04/spyeye-targets-opera-google-chrome-users/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/04/spyeye-targets-opera-google-chrome-users/)**\n\nThe latest version of the SpyEye trojan includes new capability specifically designed to steal\nsensitive data from Windows users surfing the Internet with the Google Chrome and Opera\nWeb browsers.\n\nThe author of the SpyEye trojan formerly sold the crimeware-building kit on a number of\nonline cybercrime forums, but has recently limited his showroom displays to a handful of\nhighly vetted underground communities. KrebsOnSecurity.com recently chatted with a\nmember of one of these communities who has purchased a new version of SpyEye.\nScreenshots from the package show that the latest rendition comes with the option for new\n“form grabbing” capabilities targeting Chrome and Opera users.\n\n\n-----\n\nSpyEye component in version 1.3.34 shows form grabbing options for Chrome and Opera\n\n[Trojans like ZeuS and SpyEye have the built-in ability to keep logs of every keystroke a](http://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=zeus&x=0&y=0)\nvictim types on his or her keyboard, but this kind of tracking usually creates too much\nextraneous data for the attackers, who mainly are interested in financial information such as\ncredit card numbers and online banking credentials. Form grabbers accomplish this by\nstripping out any data that victims enter in specific Web site form fields, snarfing and\nrecording that data before it can be encrypted and sent to the Web site requesting the\ninformation.\n\nBoth SpyEye and ZeuS have had the capability to do form grabbing against Internet Explorer\nand Firefox for some time, but this is the first time I’ve seen any major banking trojans claim\nthe ability to target Chrome and Opera users with this feature.\n\n**[Aviv Raff, CTO and co-founder of security alert service Seculert, said that both SpyEye and](http://www.seculert.com/)**\n[ZeuS work by “hooking” the “dynamic link library” or DLL files used by IE and Firefox.](http://www.easydesksoftware.com/dll.htm)\nHowever, Chrome and Opera appear to use different DLLs, Raff said.\n\nThis strikes me as an incremental yet noteworthy development. Many people feel more\nsecure using browsers like Chrome and Opera because they believe the browsers’ smaller\nmarket share makes them less of a target for cyber crooks. This latest SpyEye innovation is\na good reminder that computer crooks are constantly looking for new ways to better\nmonetize the resources they’ve already stolen. Security-by-obscurity is no substitute for good\n\n\n-----\n\nsecurity practices and common sense: If you ve installed a program, update it regularly; if\nyou didn’t go looking for a program, add-on or download, don’t install it; if you no longer need\na program, remove it.\n\n\n-----",
