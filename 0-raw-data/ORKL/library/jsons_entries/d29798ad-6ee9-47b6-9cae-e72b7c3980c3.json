I most recently](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/More+malspam+pushing+Lokibot/23754/)\n[posted an example to my blog on 2018-11-26. This type of malicious spam shows no signs](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2018/11/26/index.html)\nof stopping, so here's a quick diary covering an example from Monday 2018-12-03.\n\n**_The email_**\n\nTemplates for malicious spam pushing Lokibot vary, and the example from Monday 2018-1203 was disguised as a purchase quotation. The email contained an Excel spreadsheet with\na macro designed to infect vulnerable Windows hosts with Lokibot malware. Potential\nvictims need to click through warnings, so this is not an especially stealthy method of\ninfection.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Screenshot of the email with an attached Excel spreadsheet._\n\n**_Infection traffic_**\n\nA macro from the Excel spreadsheet retrieved Lokibot malware using HTTPS from a URL at\n**_a.doko[.]moe. I used_** [Fiddler to monitor the HTTPS traffic and determine the URL. The](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler)\nHTTPS request to a.doko[.]moe had no User-Agent string. If you use [curl to retrieve the](https://curl.haxx.se/)\nbinary, you must use the -H option to exclude the User-Agent line from your HTTPS request.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Traffic from the infection filtered in Wireshark._\n\n_Shown above: Using curl to retrieve the Lokibot malware binary from a.doko[.]moe._\n\n_Shown above: Post-infection traffic from the Lokibot-infected Windows host._\n\n**_Forensics on the infected host_**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe infected Windows host made Lokibot persistent through a Windows registry update.\nThis registry update was quite similar to previous Lokibot infections I've generated in my lab\nenvironment. In this example, the infected host also had a VBS file in the Windows menu\nStartup folder. This pointed to another copy of the Lokibot malware executable; however,\nthat executable had deleted itself during the infection. The only existing Lokibot executable\nwas in the directory path listed in the associated Windows registry entry.\n\n_Shown above: Windows registry update to keep Lokibot persistent._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: VBS file in the Startup menu folder specifying a location where the malware_\n_had deleted itself._\n\n**_Indicators_**\n\nThe following are indicators from an infected Windows host.
