    "plain_text": "# Conti vs. Monti: A Reinvention or Just a Simple Rebranding?\n\n**[intel471.com/blog/conti-vs-monti-a-reinvention-or-just-a-simple-rebranding](https://intel471.com/blog/conti-vs-monti-a-reinvention-or-just-a-simple-rebranding)**\n\nIt’s a familiar sounding story. A young organization with a hot software product and\nskyrocketing revenues, employee hiring fairs, lucrative salaries, bonuses and team\nrecognition programs. But this story is not about a vibrant tech company in Silicon Valley or\nAustin; rather it is a real story of a criminal organization that manages and supports the\ninsidious Conti ransomware.\n\nConti is advanced ransomware that first emerged in early 2020. It uses a bespoke encryption\nroutine to identify and encrypt files quickly and efficiently, making it especially dangerous.\nThe Conti gang uses a “double-extortion” technique, which encrypts victims’ data and\ndemands payment. They also take copies of the victims’ data, permitting them to expose or\nsell the data if the victim refuses to pay.\n\n[The operators behind the malware are a high-profile ransomware group responsible for](https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/threat-prevention/ransomware/)\nmultiple high-impact attacks. They are otherwise known as Wizard Spider and may be part of\nthe wider Trickbot cybercrime syndicate. Reportedly, they are based in Russia and support\nthe Russian government’s agenda, including the war in Ukraine. The malware is distributed\nunder a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) model. The Conti gang distributes access to its\nmalware to “affiliates” in exchange for a share of collected ransom payments. This aspect\nallows them to scale operations. Some reports cite the Conti gang operates as a modern\nstart-up with salaries, bonuses and employee recognition awards.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn just a few years, the Conti ransomware has caused damage and disruption globally. Conti\nhas targeted hospitals, governments, financial institutions and enterprises including Snapon,\nShutterfly, the Irish healthcare system and several agencies of the Costa Rican government.\nThe FBI describes the Conti ransomware as “the costliest strain of ransomware ever\ndocumented.” It estimates more than 1,000 victims have suffered Conti-associated attacks\nand total victim payouts exceed USD $150 million as of early 2022.\n\n**The end of Conti**\n\nAs with any organization, disgruntled employees sometimes turn against their employers. In\nMarch 2022, a Ukrainian researcher working for the Conti gang went rogue. Thought to be\nunhappy with the Conti gang’s Russian government affiliation and its support for the war in\nUkraine, the researcher leaked 393 files containing over 60,000 internal messages from the\nConti gang's private chat server. The leaked information has been dubbed the Conti Leaks\nand includes other sensitive data about the gang's operations, tools, and costs.\n\nSince then, infosec researchers everywhere have been sifting through this massive data\ntreasure trove. The internal breach has proved tremendously costly for the Conti gang,\nleaving them terribly exposed.\n\n[To add to their pain, in May 2022 the Rewards for Justice group within the US State](https://rewardsforjustice.net/rewards/conti/#:~:text=Rewards%20for%20Justice%20is%20offering,infrastructure%20in%20violation%20of%20the)\nDepartment announced new bounties of up to USD $10 million for anyone who provides\nuseful information about individual members of Conti. Specifically, the agency wants to know\nabout five specific gang members: actors using the handles Professor, Reshaev, Tramp,\nDandis, and Target.\n\nOn May 19, 2022, the admin panel of the Conti ransomware gang's official website shut\ndown. Shortly thereafter, in the wake of the Conti Leaks and (perhaps) the Rewards for\nJustice announcement, the gang shut down its attack infrastructure.\n\n**Out with the old…the emergence of Monti**\n\nIn recent months, Conti’s activities have quieted. Some researchers have suggested that\nConti’s diminished actions result from a rebranding exercise like many ransomware strains\nhave done before, with a number of Conti gang members likely involved. Other reports\nindicate that other RaaS operations have employed ex-Conti operators including Karakurt\nand BlackByte.\n\nThough there is no iron-clad evidence of Conti rebranding as Monti, Conti source was leaked\n[publicly in March 2022. Consequently, it is possible that anybody could use the publicly](https://twitter.com/ContiLeaks/status/1505433648023146499)\navailable source code to create their own ransomware based on Conti. This could be the\ncase with Monti from our analysis of the disassembled code. Monti's entry point is very\n\n\n-----\n\nsimilar to Conti s, as seen below. As such, Monti could be a rebrand of Conti or simply a new\nransomware variant that has been developed using the leaked source code mentioned\nabove.\n\nWhether this is Conti being rebranded as Monti, in a bid to mock the former strain, or it is just\nanother new ransomware variant on the block, it is likely we will continue to see this new\nvariant impact businesses globally. Nevertheless, using publicly available binaries to create a\nnew ransomware or relaunch an old one will hopefully give defenders an edge when dealing\nwith Monti as it evolves.\n\n\n-----",
