    "plain_text": "National Security Agency | Cybersecurity Advisory\n\nStop Malicious Cyber Activity Against Connected\nOperational Technology\nExecutive summary\nA significant shift in how operational technologies (OT) are viewed, evaluated, and secured within the U.S. is needed to\nprevent malicious cyber actors (MCA) from executing successful, and potentially damaging, cyber effects. As OT\ncomponents continue being connected to information technology (IT), IT exploitation increasingly can serve as a pivot to\nOT destructive effects[1, 2, 3]. Recent adversarial exploitation of IT management software and its supply chain has resulted\nin publicly documented impacts across the U.S. Government (USG) and the Defense Industrial Base (DIB). Malicious\ncyber activities directed at OT also continue to threaten these networks[4, 5, 6].\nThis paradigm shift applies to the stagnant OT assets and control systems installed and used throughout the USG and\nDIB, many of which are past end-of-life and operated without sufficient resources. To evaluate and improve the\ncybersecurity of connected OT and control systems, NSA recommends that National Security System (NSS), Department\nof Defense (DoD), and DIB network owners perform a detailed risk analysis prior to creating cross-domain connections\n(e.g., IT-to-OT, Internet-to-OT) and for all currently connected OT.\nFollowing the steps below will enable OT owners and administrators to evaluate risks against their systems and use that\nknowledge to guide network changes with current resources to realistically monitor and detect malicious activity. Without\ndirect action to harden OT networks and control systems against vulnerabilities introduced through IT and business\nnetwork intrusions, OT system owners and operators will remain at indefensible levels of risk.\n\nU/OO/136723-21 | PP-21-0601 | APR 2021 Ver 1.0\n\nStop Malicious Cyber Activity Against Connected Operational Technology\nTake immediate steps to improve OT cybersecurity\nFrom corporate leadership down to the OT system operators, many are asking “With such limited resources, how can we\nimprove OT and control system cybersecurity and ensure mission success?” To answer this question, NSA created this\npragmatic evaluation methodology and basic cybersecurity improvement approach for NSS, DoD, and DIB network\nowners.\n\nHolistically evaluate the value vs. risk vs. cost for enterprise IT-to-OT connectivity\n1. Acknowledge that a standalone, unconnected (“islanded”) OT system is safer from outside threats than one\nconnected to an enterprise IT system(s) with external connectivity (no matter how secure the outside connections\nare thought to be). An intermittently connected OT system can be a good compromise because it is only at risk\nwhen it is connected, which should only be done when required, such as for downloading updates or during times\nwhen remote access is required for a finite period of time.\n2. Determine the value to the enterprise of connecting the IT system to the OT network and/or control system\nenvironments. The value proposition could involve many aspects, including:\na. Convenience for connectivity and use of process data/information.\nb. Leveraging existing abilities, such as the IT workforce.\nc.\n\nUtilizing or combining with IT tools for system monitoring.\n\nd. Theoretical synergies via IT integration, such as managing updates of OT assets.\n3. Determine the risk to the enterprise of connecting the IT system to the OT environment. The risks could involve\nmany aspects, including:\na. Loss of process control.\nb. Failure of safety systems/equipment to operate as designed.\nc. Loss of revenue from process interruptions or shutdowns.\nd. Loss of human life should safety systems/equipment not operate appropriately.\n4. Quantify the increased costs associated with mitigating the additional risks from connecting the existing OT\nnetworks and devices to the enterprise IT system. The costs could involve many aspects, including:\na. Equipment to segment and protect the (typically) flat OT network and infrastructure to reduce risk of a\nwide-scale compromise.\nb. Renewed product or system licensing costs to download and update OT assets to the latest version. This\nis critical to mitigate potential vulnerabilities that are commonly known about outdated firmware, software,\netc., and is necessary to reduce the risk of exploitation in a connected environment.\nc.\n\nCosts of OT systems upgrades if OT assets include devices that are at or approaching end-of-life for\nproduct support. This should include not only the cost of the equipment, but any potential loss of revenue\n\nor mission availability from the OT equipment change-out and testing.\nd. Additional personnel and resource needs to properly maintain and secure OT assets.\n5. Present leadership with findings so they can effectively evaluate the value, risks, and expenses/resources.\n\nImprove cybersecurity for connected enterprise IT-to-OT networks\nAt a high level, existing resources and freely-available OT tools should be applied to better secure enterprise ITconnected OT systems. Additionally, while not as critical, these same recommendations can be applied to “islanded” and\nto intermittently connected OT networks and systems to improve cyber resiliency and ensure mission readiness.\n\nU/OO/136723-21 | PP-21-0601 | APR 2021 Ver 1.0\n\n2\n\nStop Malicious Cyber Activity Against Connected Operational Technology\n1. Fully manage, cryptographically protect (encrypt and authenticate), and apply an allowlist or a dial-back\napproach1 to all access vectors. Be sure to log all access attempts. Access vectors could include many aspects,\nsuch as:\na. Vendor or any outsourced OT asset support, including vendor laptops with known and unknown remote\nmonitoring connections.\nb. Remote connectivity for monitoring and/or alarm notification.\nc. Internal access, especially via existing open, unmanaged network, server, or device connections.\nd. While not as risky as remote access, direct physical access can lead to compromises, too.\n2. Wherever remote access is permitted, add sensors and monitor all cross-domain connections. It is recommended\nthat all remote access connections be disconnected until such time that active monitoring is in place.\n3. Create a known OT network map and device settings baseline, and validate all equipment on the network.\na. Utilize topographical and physical network mapping and inventorying.\nb. Readily available open-source tools can meet this requirement2.\n4. Create a known OT network communication baseline.\na. Readily available open-source tools can meet this requirement2.\n5. Assess and prioritize OT network cybersecurity needs to identify required mitigations and define short-, medium-,\nand long-term cyber-hardening outcomes.\na. Depending on in-house IT/OT expertise and capabilities, this step may require external OT expertise.\nHowever, a “living” cybersecurity improvement plan will identify and prioritize specific OT cybersecurity\nrisks. It will also provide a roadmap for continuously applying mitigations, near-term improvements, and\nstrategies to achieve long-term cybersecurity goals.\n6. Create an exemplar “gold copy” baseline to enable all OT networks and devices to be repaired and/or reinstantiated.\na. Gold copy restoration files and capabilities should be stored in locked, unconnected locations. Do not\nstore gold copy restoration data on-line or on-network.\nb. Practice OT network re-instantiation to ensure success and shorten OT network downtime if an issue or\nmalicious activity occurs.\nWhile there are very real needs for connectivity and automating processes, operational technologies and control systems\nare inherently at risk when connected to enterprise IT systems. Seriously consider the risk, benefits, and cost before\nconnecting (or continuing to connect) enterprise IT and OT networks. Mindfully prioritize and consider the risks before\nallowing enterprise IT-to-OT connections. While OT systems rarely require outside connectivity to properly function, they\nare frequently connected for convenience without proper consideration of the true risk and potential adverse business and\nmission consequences. Taking action now can help improve cybersecurity and ensure mission readiness.\n\n1 formerly called a “whitelist” approach – a default deny, with only specific needed items allowed\n2 Contact your cybersecurity service provider or appropriate government point of contact to help identify the appropriate available tools.\n\nU/OO/136723-21 | PP-21-0601 | APR 2021 Ver 1.0\n\n3\n\nStop Malicious Cyber Activity Against Connected Operational Technology\nWorks Cited\n[1] Federal Bureau of Investigation, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Environmental Protection Agency, and\nMulti-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (2021).
