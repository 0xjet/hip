Spotting DGAs can be difficult without\na clear, searchable pattern.\n\nCato researchers began by collecting traffic metadata from malicious Chrome extensions to\ntheir C&C services. Cato maintains a data warehouse built from the metadata of all traffic\nflows crossing its global private backbone. We analyze those flows for suspicious traffic to\nhunt threats on a daily basis.\n\nThe researchers were able to identify the same traffic patterns and network behavior in traffic\noriginating from 80 different malicious Chrome extensions, which were identified as from the\nBujo, Dealply and ManageX families of malicious extensions. By examining the C&C\ndomains, researchers observed an algorithm used to create the malicious domains. In many\ncases, DGAs appear as random characters. In some cases, the domains contain numbers,\nand in other cases the domains are very long, making them look suspicious.\n\n\n-----\n\nHere are a few examples of the C&C domains (full domain list at the end of this post):\n\nqalus.com jurokotu.com bunafo.com naqodur.com womohu.com bosojojo.com\n\nmucac.com kuqotaj.com bunupoj.com pocakaqu.com wuqah.com dubocoso.com\n\nsanaju.com lufacam.com cajato.com qunadap.com dagaju.com fupoj.com\n\nThe most obvious trait the domains have in common is that they are all part of “.com” TLD\n(Top-Level Domain). Also, all the prefixes are five to eight letters long.\n\nThere are other factors shared by the domains. For one, they all start with consonants and\nthen create a pattern that is built out of consonants and vowels; so that every domain is\nrepresented by consonant + vowel + consonant + vowel + consonant, etc. As an example, in\njurokotu.com domain, removing the TLD will bring “jurokotu”, and coloring the word to\nconsonants (red) and vowels (blue) will show the pattern: “jurokotu”.\n\nFrom the domains we collected, we could see that the adversaries used the vowels: o, u and\na, and consonants: q, m, s, p, r, j, k, l, w, b, c, n, d, f, t, h, and g. Clearly, an algorithm has\nbeen used to create these domains and the intention was to make them look as close to real\nwords as possible.\n\n[8 Ways SASE Answers Your Current and Future Security & IT Needs [eBook]](https://www.catonetworks.com/resources/8-ways-sase-answers-your-current-and-future-it-security-needs/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=top_cta&utm_campaign=8_ways_sase_answers_needs_ebook)\n\n## “Shimmy” DGA infrastructure\n\nA few additional notable findings are related to the same common infrastructure used by all\nthe C&C domains.\n\nAll domains are registered using the same registrar – Gal Communication (CommuniGal)\nLtd. (GalComm), which was previously associated with registration of malicious domains [2].\n\n\n-----\n\nThe domains are also classified as ‘uncategorized’ by classification engines, another sign\nthat these domains are being used by malware. Trying to access the domains via browser,\nwill either get you a landing page or HTTP ERROR 403 (Forbidden). However, we believe\nthat there are server controls that allow access to the malicious extensions based on specific\nhttp headers.\n\nAll domains are translated to IP addresses belonging to Amazon AWS, part of AS16509. The\ndomains do not share the same IP, and from time to time it seems that the IP for a particular\ndomain is changed dynamically, as can be seen in this example:\n\ntawuhoju.com 13.224.161.119 14/04/2021\n\ntawuhoju.com 13.224.161.119 15/04/2021\n\ntawuhoju.com 13.224.161.22 23/04/2021\n\n\n-----\n\ntawuhoju.com 13.224.161.22 24/04/2021\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nGiven all this evidence, it’s clear to us that the infrastructure used on these campaigns is\nleveraging AWS and that it is a very large campaign. We identified many connection points\nbetween 80 C&C domains, identifying their DGA and infrastructure. This could be used to\nidentify the C&C communication and infected machines, by analyzing network traffic.\nSecurity teams can now use these insights to identify the traffic from malicious Chrome\nextensions.\n\n## IOC\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nbacugo[.]com\n\nbagoj[.]com\n\nbaguhoh[.]com\n\nbosojojo[.]com\n\nbowocofa[.]com\n\nbuduguh[.]com\n\nbujot[.]com\n\nbunafo[.]com\n\nbunupoj[.]com\n\ncagodobo[.]com\n\ncajato[.]com\n\ncopamu[.]com\n\ncusupuh[.]com\n\ndafucah[.]com\n\ndagaju[.]com\n\ndapowar[.]com\n\ndubahu[.]com\n\ndubocoso[.]com\n\ndudujutu[.]com\n\nfocuquc[.]com\n\nfogow[.]com\n\nfokosul[.]com\n\nfupoj[.]com\n\nfusog[.]com\n\nfuwof[.]com\n\ngapaqaw[.]com\n\ngaruq[.]com\n\ngufado[.]com\n\nhamohuhu[.]com\n\nhodafoc[.]com\n\nhoqunuja[.]com\n\nhuful[.]com\n\njagufu[.]com\n\njurokotu[.]com\n\njuwakaha[.]com\n\nkocunolu[.]com\n\nkogarowa[.]com\n\nkohaguk[.]com\n\nkuqotaj[.]com\n\nkuquc[.]com\n\nlohoqoco[.]com\n\nloruwo[.]com\n\nlufacam[.]com\n\nluhatufa[.]com\n\nmocujo[.]com\n\nmoqolan[.]com\n\nmuqudu[.]com\n\nnaqodur[.]com\n\nnokutu[.]com\n\nnopobuq[.]com\n\nnopuwa[.]com\n\nnorugu[.]com\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nnosahof[.]com\n\nnuqudop[.]com\n\nnusojog[.]com\n\npocakaqu[.]com\n\nponojuju[.]com\n\npowuwuqa[.]com\n\npudacasa[.]com\n\npupahaqo[.]com\n\nqaloqum[.]com\n\nqotun[.]com\n\nqufobuh[.]com\n\nqunadap[.]com\n\nqurajoca[.]com\n\nqusonujo[.]com\n\nrokuq[.]com\n\nruboja[.]com\n\nsanaju[.]com\n\nsarolosa[.]com\n\nsupamajo[.]com\n\ntafasajo[.]com\n\ntawuhoju[.]com\n\ntocopada[.]com\n\ntudoq[.]com\n\nturasawa[.]com\n\nwomohu[.]com\n\nwujop[.]com\n\nwunab[.]com\n\nwuqah[.]com\n\n```\n_References:_\n\n[1] https://www.catonetworks.com/blog/threat-intelligence-feeds-and-endpoint-protectionsystems-fail-to-detect-24-malicious-chrome-extensions/\n[2]\n[https://awakesecurity.com/blog/the-internets-new-arms-dealers-malicious-domain-registrars/](https://awakesecurity.com/blog/the-internets-new-arms-dealers-malicious-domain-registrars/)\n\n## Elad Menahem\n\nElad Menahem is the Director of Security at Cato Networks.
