This breach\nallowed attackers to compromise the integrity of the RSA SecurID authentication system.\nAttackers subsequently used information obtained via this breach in attacks against military\ncontractors such as Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman and L-3 Communications.\n\nThe phishing email originated from a spoofed email address that bypassed reputation-based\nemail filtering, contained a Flash zero-day exploit for which no patch or IPS/AV signature existed\nand thus was able to penetrate all network perimeter and system-level defenses. Given that\nAdobe Flash has a history of serious security vulnerabilities and that client applications are\nnotoriously difficult for companies to patch, it is highly likely that other zero-day Flash\nvulnerabilities will be discovered and used in attempts to penetrate other organizations. Because\nmalicious payloads can be deeply embedded, traditional signature-based network methods are\ngenerally ineffective against this type of threat. Given that it serves virtually no business purpose\nto embed Adobe Flash content inside Microsoft Office documents, detecting and/or excising such\ncontent from payloads is recommended.\n```\nThreat Overview\n\n```\nThe RSA hack consisted of three stages. The first stage was a spear-fishing email containing an\nExcel spreadsheet with an embedded, malicious Flash object. The second stage was the\nestablishment of remote access via a Poison Ivy reverse tunnel. The third stage involved an\nunspecified series of internal privilege escalations and the eventual compromise of the RSA\nSecurID system. (Poison Ivy will be covered in a separate Fidelis Threat Advisory; few specifics\nare known about the methods used by the attackers to penetrate RSA’s network after the initial\nbreach, so this FTA describes only the initial exploitation.)\n\nUsers are granted permission to copy and/or distribute this document in its original electronic form and print copies for personal use.

The vulnerability was later assigned CVE number\nCVE-2011-0609. The email came from a spoofed email address that bypassed email security\ngateway appliances. Once on the system, the malware downloaded a specialized Poison Ivy\ntoolkit and established a reverse tunnel. Attackers then used this reverse tunnel to mount further\nattacks.\n```\nRisk Assessment\n\n```\nMicrosoft Office and Adobe Flash are ubiquitous, and while Office is relatively easy for most\norganizations to patch, Adobe Flash is far more challenging. Even if an organization were perfect\nwith their patches, the exploit used in this case was a zero-day: it exploited an unknown and\nunpatched vulnerability. Given the ease by which the malware was able to evade traditional\nnetwork defenses and given that it led to a serious enough breach of RSA’s SecurID system that\nthey were forced to reissue millions of tokens, the threat of a similar type of attack is extremely\nserious.\n```\nIndicators & Mitigation Strategies\n\n```\nGiven the relatively high number of recently discovered Flash vulnerabilities and Adobe’s poor\napplication security track record, it is likely that another zero-day vulnerability will be utilized in\nthis type of attack. Signature-based defenses will thus be of negligible use against cutting-edge\nthreats. The unusual packaging of the threat is its greatest weakness: there exist few legitimate\nuses for a Microsoft Office document with embedded Flash and thus we recommend detecting\nand/or excising such an uncommon file when it appears in network streams.\n```\nThe Fidelis Take\n\n```\nFidelis has made a rule available to customers that detects and/or blocks Adobe Flash content in\nMicrosoft Office documents when transmitted over the network. This rule is effective regardless of\nprotocol, the degree of embedding, the vulnerability used, the delivery method chosen by the\nattackers, or the level of sophistication behind the social engineering attempts.\n```\nFurther Reading\n\n```\n- Dark Reading, “Researchers Uncover The Email That Led To The RSA Hack”, Tim Wilson,\n8/26/11.
