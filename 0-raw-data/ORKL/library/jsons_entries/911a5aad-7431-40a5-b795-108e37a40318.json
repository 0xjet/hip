This actor\nfocuses a significant amount of its targeting activity on entities in Southeast Asia,\n**particularly Vietnam. Heavy activity was observed in the late spring and early summer of**\n2014 when tensions between China and other Southeast Asian nations were high, due to\nconflict over territory in the South China Sea. GOBLIN PANDA targets have been\n**primarily observed in the defense, energy, and government sectors.**\n\nLast month, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed renewed activity from GOBLIN PANDA\ntargeting Vietnam. As part of this campaign, new exploit documents were identified with\nVietnamese-language lures and themes, as well as Vietnam-themed, adversary-controlled\n\n\n-----\n\ninfrastructure.\n\nTwo exploit documents with Vietnamese-language file names were observed with file\nmetadata unique to the GOBLIN PANDA adversary. Decoy content displayed in these\nincidents used Vietnamese-language Microsoft Office Word documents with training-related\nthemes. These documents did not specifically reference Vietnamese government projects\nor departments, however they could still be directed towards Government of Vietnam\npersonnel.\n\nWhen opened, both documents use CVE-2012-0158 exploit code to drop malicious files\nassociated with a previously identified side-loading malware implant, tracked as QCRat by\nCrowdStrike Falcon® Intelligence™.\n\nBoth exploit documents used a previously identified legitimate executable, and a sideloading implant Dynamic Link Library (DLL), as well as new implant configuration files\nstored as a .tlb file.\n\nAnalysis of command and control infrastructure suggests that GOBLIN PANDA is targeting\nentities in Laos, as well. CrowdStrike Intelligence has not directly observed Laotian\ntargeting, and cannot confirm targets in Laos for this campaign, however, previous activity\nlinked to GOBLIN PANDA has targeted this country.\n\nGiven major economic initiatives by China, such as the Belt and Road Initiative and\ncontinued dispute over the Paracel Islands, it is unlikely that GOBLIN PANDA will abandon\nefforts to collect intelligence from South East Asian neighbors and businesses operating in\nthat region.\n\nThere are no known community or industry names associated with this actor.\n\n## Other Known China-based Adversaries\n\n[Anchor Panda](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/whois-anchor-panda/)\n[Deep Panda](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/ironman-deep-panda-uses-sakula-malware-target-organizations-multiple-sectors/)\n[Mustang Panda](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-june-mustang-panda/)\n[Samurai Panda](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/whois-samurai-panda/)\n\n**_Curious about other nation-state adversaries?_** _[Visit our threat actor center to learn about](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-the-adversaries/)_\n_the new adversaries that the CrowdStrike team discovers._\n\n## Learn More\n\nTo learn more about how to incorporate intelligence on threat actors like GOBLIN\nPANDA into your security strategy, please visit the _[Falcon Threat Intelligence page.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/?ctm_source=Website&ctm_medium=Blog&ctm_campaign=Blog-Inline-Copy)_\n**Want the insights on the latest adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures**\n**(TTPs)?
