While these attacks garnered public attention, the activities](http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/02/20/how-the-syrian-electronic-army-hacked-us-a-detailed-timeline/)\n\nof another group – The Syrian Malware Team – have gone largely unnoticed. The group’s activities\n\nprompted us to take a closer look. We discovered this group using a .NET based RAT called BlackWorm to\n\ninfiltrate their targets.\n\nThe Syrian Malware Team is largely pro-Syrian government, as seen in one of their banners featuring\n\nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad. Based on the sentiments publicly expressed by this group it is likely that\n\nthey are either directly or indirectly involved with the Syrian government. Further certain members of the\n\n[Syrian Malware Team have ties to the Syrian Electronic army (SEA) known to be linked to the Syrian](http://intelcrawler.com/ic-sea.pdf)\n\ngovernment. This indicates that the Syrian Malware Team may also be possibly an offshoot or part of the\n\nSEA.\n\nBanner used by the Syrian Malware Team\n\n## BlackWorm Authorship\n\nWe found at least two distinct versions of the BlackWorm tool, including an original/private version\n\n(v0.3.0) and the Dark Edition (v2.1). The original BlackWorm builder was co-authored by Naser Al\n\n[Mutairi from Kuwait, better known by his online moniker ‘njq8′. He is also known to have coded njw0rm,](http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/malware-research/2013/08/njw0rm-brother-from-the-same-mother.html)\n\n[njRAT/LV, and earlier versions of H-worm/Houdini. We found his code being used in a slew of other](http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/botnet-activities-research/2012/09/the-story-behind-backdoorlv.html)\n\nRATs such as Fallaga and Spygate. BlackWorm v0.3.0 was also co-authored by another actor, Black Mafia.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout section within the original version of BlackWorm builder\n\nWithin the underground development forums, it’s common for threat actors to collaborate on toolsets.\n\nSome write the base tools that other attackers can use; others modify and enhance existing tools.\n\nThe BlackWorm builder v2.1 is a prime example of actors modifying and enhancing current RATs. After\n\nnjq8 and Black Mafia created the original builder, another author, Black.Hacker, enhanced its feature set.\n\nAbout section within BlackWorm Dark Edition builder\n\nBlack.Hacker’s banner on social media\n\nAs an interesting side note, ‘njq8′ took down his blog in recent months and announced a cease in all\n\nmalware development activity on his Twitter and Facebook account, urging others to stop as well. This is\n\n[likely a direct result of the lawsuit filed against him by Microsoft.](http://garwarner.blogspot.com/2014/06/microsoft-njrat-and-no-ip.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe builder for BlackWorm v0.3.0 is fairly simple and allows for very quick payload, but doesn’t allow any\n\nconfiguration other than the IP address for command and control (C2).\n\nBuilding binary through BlackWorm v0.3.0\n\nBlackWorm v0.3.0 controller\n\nBlackWorm v0.3.0 supports the following commands between the controller and the implant:\n\nping Checks if victim is online\ncloseserver Exits the implant\nrestartserver Restarts the implant\nsendfile Transfer and run file from server\ndownload Download and run file from URL\nddos Ping flood target\nmsgbox Message interaction with victim\ndown Kill critical windows processes\nblocker Block specified website by pointing\nresolution to 127.0.0.1\nlogoff Logout out of windows\nrestart Restart system\nshutdown Shutdown system\nmore Disable task manager, registry\ntools, system restore. Also blocks\nkeyboard and mouse input\nhror Displays a startling flash video\n\nIn addition to the features supported by the command structure, the payload can:\n\n|ping|Checks if victim is online|\n|---|---|\n|closeserver|Exits the implant|\n|restartserver|Restarts the implant|\n|sendfile|Transfer and run file from server|\n|download|Download and run file from URL|\n|ddos|Ping flood target|\n|msgbox|Message interaction with victim|\n|down|Kill critical windows processes|\n|blocker|Block specified website by pointing resolution to 127.0.0.1|\n|logoff|Logout out of windows|\n|restart|Restart system|\n|shutdown|Shutdown system|\n|more|Disable task manager, registry tools, system restore. Also blocks keyboard and mouse input|\n|hror|Displays a startling flash video|\n\n\n-----\n\nDisable Task Manager to kill process dialog\n\nCopy itself to USB drives and create autorun entries\n\nCopy itself to common peer-to-peer (P2P) share locations\n\nCollect system information such as OS, username, hostname, presence of camera, active window\n\nname, etc., to display in the controller\n\nKill the following analysis processes (if found):\n\nprocexp\n\nSbieCtrl\n\nSpyTheSpy\n\nSpeedGear\n\nWireshark\n\nMBAM\n\nApateDNS\n\nIPBlocker\n\ncPorts\n\nProcessHacker\n\nAntiLogger\n\nThe Syrian Malware Team primarily uses another version of BlackWorm called the Dark Edition (v2.1).\n\nBlackWorm v2.1 was released on a prolific underground forum where information and code is often\n\nshared, traded and sold.\n\n\n-----\n\nBlackWorm v2.1 has the same abilities as the original version and additional functionality, including\n\nbypassing UAC, disabling host firewalls and spreading over network shares. Unlike its predecessor, it also\n\nallows for granular control of the features available within the RAT. These additional controls allow the\n\nRAT user to enable and disable features as needed. Binary output can be also be generated in multiple\n\nformats, such as .exe, .src and .dll.\n\nBlackWorm Dark Edition builder\n\n\n-----\n\nWe observed activity from the Syrian Malware Team going as far back as Jan. 1, 2011. Based on Facebook\n\nposts, they are allegedly directly or indirectly involved with the Syrian government. Their Facebook page\n\nshows they are still very active, with a post as recent as July 16[th], 2014.\n\nSyrian Malware Team’s Facebook page\n\nThe Syrian Malware Team has been involved in everything from profiling targets to orchestrating attacks\n\nthemselves. There are seemingly multiple members, including:\n\nPartial list of self-proclaimed Syrian Malware Team members\n\nSome of these people have posted malware-related items on Facebook.\n\n\n-----\n\nFacebook posting of virus scanning of files\n\nWhile looking for Dark Edition samples, we discovered a binary named svchost.exe (MD5:\n\n015c51e11e314ff99b1487d92a1ba09b). We quickly saw indicators that it was created by BlackWorm Dark\n\nEdition.\n\nConfiguration options within code\n\nThe malware communicated out to 178.44.115.196, over port 5050, with a command structure of:\n\n!0/j|n\\12121212_64F3BF1F/j|n\\{Hostname}/j|n\\{Username}/j|n\\USA/j|n\\Win 7 Professional SP1\n\nx86/j|n\\No/j|n\\2.4.0 [ Dark Edition]/j|n\\/j|n\\{ActiveWindowName}/j|n\\[endof]\n\nWhen looking at samples of Dark Edition BlackWorm being used by the Syrian Malware Team, the strings\n\n[“Syrian Malware,” or “Syrian Malware Team” are often used in the C2 communications or within the](http://syrianmalware.com/files/Attack.m.exe%20-%20Report.pdf)\n\nbinary strings.\n\nAdditional pivoting off of svchost.exe brought us to three additional samples apparently built with\n\nBlackWorm Dark Edition. E.exe, (MD5: a8cf815c3800202d448d035300985dc7) a binary that drew our\n\nattention, looked to be a backdoor with the Syrian Malware strings within it.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen executed, the binary beacons to aliallosh.sytes.net on port 1177. This C2 has been seen in multiple\n\nmalware runs often associated with Syria. The command structure of the binary is:\n\n!0/j|n\\Syrian Malware/j|n\\{Hostname}/j|n\\{Username}/j|n\\USA/j|n\\Win 7 Professional SP1\n\nx86/j|n\\No/j|n \\0.1/j|n\\/j|n\\{ActiveWindowName}/j|n\\[endof]\n\nFinally, pivoting to another sample, 1gpj.srcRania (MD5:f99c15c62a5d981ffac5fdb611e13095), the same\n\nstrings were present. The string “Rania” used as a lure was in Arabic and likely refers to the prolific Queen\n\nRania of Jordan.\n\nThe traffic is nearly identical to the other samples we identified and tied to the Syrian Malware Team.\n\n!1/j|n\\C:\\Documents and Settings\\{Username}\\Local Settings\\Application DataldoDrZdpkK.jpg –\n\nWindows Internet Explorer[endof]!0/j|n\\Syrian Malware/j|n\\{Hostname}/j|n\\\n\n{Username}/j|n\\USA/j|n\\Win XP ProfessionalSP2 x86/j|n\\No/j|n\\0.1/j|n\\/j|n\\C:\\Documents and\n\nSettings\\{Username}\\Local Settings\\Application DataldoDrZdpkK.jpg – {ActiveWindowName}/j|n\\\n\n[endof]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDetermining which groups use which malware is often very difficult. Connecting the dots between actors\n\nand malware typically involves looking at binary code, identifying related malware examples associated\n\nwith those binaries, and reviewing infection vectors, among other things.\n\nThis blog presents a prime example of the process of attribution. We connected a builder with malware\n\nsamples and the actors/developers behind these attacks. This type of attribution is key to creating\n\n\n-----\n\n[This entry was posted in Threat Intelligence, Threat Research and tagged advanced threat, syrian cyber](http://www.fireeye.com/blog/category/technical/threat-intelligence)\n\n[threats, Syrian Electronic Army, Syrian Malware Team, threat group by Kyle Wilhoit and Thoufique Haq.](http://www.fireeye.com/blog/tag/syrian-electronic-army)\n\n[Bookmark the permalink.](http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/2014/08/connecting-the-dots-syrian-malware-team-uses-blackworm-for-attacks.html)\n\n\n-----",
