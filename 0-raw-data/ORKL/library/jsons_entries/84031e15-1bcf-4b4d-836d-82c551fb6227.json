By default, all WatchGuard appliances are configured for restricted\nmanagement access.\n\nFederal Civilian Executive Branch Agencies (FCEB) agencies must secure their systems\nagainst these security flaws according to November's binding operational directive (BOD 2201).\n\nCISA has given them three weeks, until May 2nd, to patch the CVE-2022-23176 flaw added\ntoday to its catalog of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities.\n\n[Even though this directive only applies to federal agencies, CISA also strongly urged all US](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2022/04/11/cisa-adds-eight-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\norganizations to prioritize fixing this actively abused security bug to avoid having their\nWatchGuard appliances compromised.\n\n## Malware hit 1% of WatchGuard firewall appliances\n\nCyclops Blink, the malware used by the Sandworm state hackers to create their botnet, has\n[been used to target WatchGuard Firebox firewall appliances with CVE-2022-23176 exploits,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-uk-link-new-cyclops-blink-malware-to-russian-state-hackers/)\nas well as [multiple ASUS router models, since at least June 2019.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/asus-warns-of-cyclops-blink-malware-attacks-targeting-routers/)\n\nIt establishes persistence on the device through firmware updates, and it provides its\noperators with remote access to compromised networks.\n\nIt uses the infected devices' legitimate firmware update channels to maintain access to the\ncompromised devices by injecting malicious code and deploying repacked firmware images.\n\nThis malware is also modular, making it simple to upgrade and target new devices and\nsecurity vulnerabilities, tapping into new pools of exploitable hardware.\n\n[WatchGuard issued its own advisory after US and UK cybersecurity and law enforcement](https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-news/blog/important-detection-and-remediation-actions-cyclops-blink-state-sponsored-botnet)\nagencies linked the malware to the GRU hackers, saying that Cyclops Blink may have hit\nroughly 1% of all active WatchGuard firewall appliances.\n\nThe UK NCSC, FBI, CISA, and NSA joint advisory says organizations should assume all\naccounts on infected devices as being compromised. Admins should also immediately\nremove Internet access to the management interface.\n\n## Botnet disrupted, malware removed from C2 servers\n\nOn Wednesday, US government officials announced the disruption of the Cyclops Blink\nbotnet before being weaponized and used in attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe FBI also removed the malware from Watchguard devices identified as being used as\ncommand and control servers, notifying owners of compromised devices in the United States\nand abroad before cleaning the Cyclops Blink infection.\n\n\"I should caution that as we move forward, any Firebox devices that acted as bots, may still\nremain vulnerable in the future until mitigated by their owners,\" FBI Director Chris Wray\nwarned.\n\n\"So those owners should still go ahead and adopt Watchguard's detection and remediation\nsteps as soon as possible.\"\n\n[WatchGuard has shared instructions on restoring infected Firebox appliances to a clean](https://techsearch.watchguard.com/KB?type=Article&SFDCID=kA16S000000SNyiSAG&lang=en_US)\nstate and updating them to the latest Fireware OS version to prevent future infections.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[CISA adds 41 vulnerabilities to list of bugs used in cyberattacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-adds-41-vulnerabilities-to-list-of-bugs-used-in-cyberattacks/)\n\n[CISA warns admins to patch actively exploited Spring, Zyxel bugs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-warns-admins-to-patch-actively-exploited-spring-zyxel-bugs/)\n\n[CISA shares guidance to block ongoing F5 BIG-IP attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-shares-guidance-to-block-ongoing-f5-big-ip-attacks/)\n\n[CISA tells federal agencies to fix actively exploited F5 BIG-IP bug](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-tells-federal-agencies-to-fix-actively-exploited-f5-big-ip-bug/)\n\n[US offers $10 million reward for tips on Russian Sandworm hackers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-offers-10-million-reward-for-tips-on-russian-sandworm-hackers/)\n\n\n-----",
