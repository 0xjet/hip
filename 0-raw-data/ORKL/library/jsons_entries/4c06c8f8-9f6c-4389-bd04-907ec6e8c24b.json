These\nsummaries are based on our threat intelligence research; and they provide a\nrepresentative snapshot of what we have published and discussed in greater detail in our\nprivate APT reports. They are designed to highlight the significant events and findings\nthat we feel people should be aware of.\n\nThis is our latest installment, focusing on activities that we observed during Q1 2022.\n\nReaders who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more\n[information on a specific report, are encouraged to contact intelreports@kaspersky.com.](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n_Disclaimer: when referring to APT groups as Russian-speaking, Chinese-speaking or_\n_other-“speaking” languages, we refer to various artefacts used by the groups (such as_\n_malware debugging strings, comments found in scripts, etc.) containing words in these_\n_languages, based on the information we obtained directly or which is otherwise publicly_\n\n\n-----\n\n_known and reported widely. The use of certain languages does not necessarily indicate_\n_a specific geographic relation but rather points to the languages that the developers_\n_behind these APT artefacts use._\n\n## The most remarkable findings\n\nOn January 14, 70 Ukrainian websites were defaced: the attackers posted the message “be\nafraid and expect the worst”. The defacement message on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nwebsite, written in Ukrainian, Russian and Polish, suggested that personal data uploaded\nto the site had been destroyed. Subsequently, DDoS attacks hit several government\n[websites. The following day, Microsoft reported that it had found destructive malware,](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/)\ndubbed WhisperGate, on the systems of government bodies and agencies that work\nclosely with the Ukrainian government. We analyzed the associated samples and\nconcluded that the deployed malware was not comparable in complexity or code\nsimilarity to malware leveraged in previous destruction campaigns such as NotPetya or\nBadRabbit; but was much more reminiscent of that typically used by cybercriminals. We\nalso identified two samples developed in December 2021 containing test strings and\npreceding revisions of the ransom note observed in Microsoft’s shared samples. It\nremains unclear who is behind the attack, although Serhiy Demedyuk, deputy secretary of\n[Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, stated that it was the work of UNC1151,](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-ukraine-suspects-group-linked-belarus-intelligence-over-cyberattack-2022-01-15/)\na threat actor believed to be linked to Belarus. Throughout our investigation, we\nidentified two samples developed in December 2021 containing test strings and earlier\nrevisions of the ransom note observed in Microsoft’s shared samples. We concluded with\nhigh confidence that these samples were earlier iterations of the wiper reportedly used in\nUkraine. Additionally, we suspect that the MBR wiper was initially developed at that time\nand repurposed more recently for the above campaign. This could have been done either\nby an advanced actor with the intention of conveying the false notion that the operation\nwas being conducted by criminals; or in cooperation with lower-tier threat actors who\ncontributed their own resources.\n\nOn January 26, CERT-UA published a report showing code similarity between\nWhisperKill (the file wiper used during the WhisperGate campaign) and\nWhiteBlackCrypt, a wiper used in the first quarter of 2021. While we were unable to\nobtain the same results by analyzing the CERT-UA samples, we subsequently identified a\ndifferent WhiteBlackCrypt sample matching the WhisperKill architecture and sharing\nsimilar code. We also investigated the Bitcoin wallets used by both WhisperGate and\nWhiteBlackCrypt, but were unable to uncover any link between the two.\n\nOn February 23, ESET published a tweet announcing new wiper malware targeting\nUkraine. The malware was more advanced than the samples identified earlier in the year\nthat we documented in two of our private reports. This wiper, named HermeticWiper by\nthe research community, abuses legitimate drivers from EaseUS Partition Master to\ncorrupt the drivers of the compromised system. One of the identified samples was\n\n\n-----\n\ncompiled on December 28, 2021, suggesting that this destructive campaign had been\nplanned for months. At the time of publication, we had not identified any similarities\nbetween HermeticWiper and other known malware.\n\nThe following day, Avast Threat Research announced the discovery of new Golang\nransomware in Ukraine, which they dubbed HermeticRansom. This malware was found\naround the same time as HermeticWiper; and publicly available information from the\nsecurity community indicated that it was used in recent cyberattacks in Ukraine. Due to\nits unsophisticated style and poor implementation, this new ransomware was probably\nonly a smokescreen for the HermeticWiper attack, due to its non-sophisticated style and\n[poor implementation. We named this malware Elections GoRansom.](https://securelist.com/elections-goransom-and-hermeticwiper-attack/105960/)\n\nIn late February 2022, we identified two archives submitted from network addresses in\nUkraine to an online multi-scanner service. Both archives leveraged the name of the\nSecurity Service of Ukraine (SBU or СБУ) to trick targets into executing a Remote Access\nTool (RAT). We were unable to determine the ultimate goal of deploying such RATs, or\nassociate the campaigns with any known threat actor, but the two archives appear linked\ntogether and may have been deployed by the same operators. Such threats pose a risk to\nUkrainian organizations and their partners, as well as foreign organizations with\npremises in Ukraine. The RAT deployment campaigns look like they are targeted at\ndeveloping access at scale in Ukraine, which could match activities from criminal groups\nthat pledged allegiance to Russia, and may enable further destructive activities.\n\n[On March 1, ESET published a blog post related to wipers used in Ukraine and to the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/)\nongoing conflict: in addition to HermeticWiper, this post introduced IsaacWiper, used to\ntarget specific machines previously compromised with another remote administration\ntool named RemCom, commonly used by attackers for lateral movement within\ncompromised networks. Contrary to reporting from other vendors, this wiper does not\nleverage the Isaac PRNG.\n\nOn March 10, researchers from the Global Research and Analysis Team shared their\ninsights into past and present cyberattacks in Ukraine. You can find the recording of the\n[webinar here and a summary/Q&A here.](https://securelist.com/webinars/ukraine-cyberattack-analysis/)\n\nOn March 22, the Ukraine CERT published a new alert about the DoubleZero wiper\ntargeting the country. This is a new wiper, written in .NET, with no similarities to\npreviously discovered wipers targeting Ukrainian entities. According to the CERT public\nstatement, the campaign took place on March 17, when several targets in Ukraine\nreceived a ZIP archive with the filename “Вирус… крайне опасно!!!.zip” (translation:\n“Virus… extremely dangerous!!!.zip”).\n\n## Russian-speaking activity\n\n\n-----\n\nIn December 2021, as a result of our continued monitoring of the activities of the\nDustSquad threat actor, we observed new infrastructure and tools being used alongside\nthe already known Octopus Trojan. We had initially analyzed this Delphi malware in April\n2018. Since then, the actor has continued to target diplomatic entities of several Central\nAsian countries; and, according to our telemetry, their consulates in APAC and the\nMiddle East are also affected by recent campaigns. Octopus is only one of DustSquad’s\ntools, along with other Windows and Android malware such as Zaka, Akinak and\nHarpoon. For Windows development, Delphi has been the group’s traditional\nprogramming language of choice. The actor maintains a two-layered communication\nscheme, with relays and real C2s, utilizing a JSON-formatted base64-encoded network\ncommunication protocol, via the use of a third-party IndyProject library. We have\npreviously seen DustSquad use third-party post-exploitation tools, such as the password\ndumping utility fgdump; but we have now observed new custom C modules, a first for\nDustSquad, and Delphi downloaders acting as post-exploitation facilitators, able to gather\ndocuments of interest for the actor. Malicious Windows executables have also been\ncompiled with GCC under the MinGW environment.\n\n## Chinese-speaking activity\n\nWhile hunting for malicious IIS modules, following our earlier reports about the mass\nexploitation of ProxyLogon and the Owowa module, we identified another backdoor\nmodule that has been widely deployed since at least June 2021. We named it BlackMoule,\nas we believe it is an update of BlackMould, a malicious tool that was briefly mentioned\nby Microsoft in late 2019 as part of GALLIUM activities against telecoms companies (aka\nOperation SoftCell).\n\nIn May 2021, we reported on Websiic, a cluster of activities that formed a set of attacks\nagainst high-profile targets in Europe and Asia. The attackers used the infamous\nProxyLogon exploit to compromise Exchange servers and deploy a China Chopper web\nshell, which was in turn used to start a sophisticated infection scheme leading to the\nexecution of a new backdoor that we dubbed Samurai. The toolset includes several unique\nloaders and installers that had not previously been observed and can be used to load\nmalicious payloads directly into memory, usually in the context of a legitimate process\nsuch as svchost.exe. We discovered continued activity involving multiple new loaders and\ninstallers, which were supposedly used to deploy different malicious payloads. We also\nobserved that the malware was exclusively used against servers until August 2021; but\nstarting from September, similar samples were also observed targeting desktop\nenvironments via messaging applications such as Telegram. Despite the discovery of weak\nties to the FunnyDream cluster, we were unable to confidently attribute this new\ncampaign to an existing group, so we dubbed the threat actor behind these attack clusters\nToddyCat. Our private report on the matter takes a closer look at the available evidence:\nwe concluded that the overlaps are weak but unlikely to be coincidental, leading us to\nbelieve that the actor behind Websiic might be part of the Chinese-speaking nebulae.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the end of January, the BfV (Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution of\nGermany) issued a report detailing activity by the APT27 group (aka LuckyMouse)\ntargeting German commercial companies. Their analysis outlines the usage of a common\ninfection triad leveraged by the group, whereby a legitimate executable (mempeng.exe or\nvfhost.exe) side-loads a malicious DLL (vftrace.dll), which in turn invokes the execution\nof the HyperBro malware from position-independent code found within a third file\n(thumb.dat). By investigating this threat through the lens of Kaspersky’s telemetry, we\nfound an identical intrusion set targeting an enterprise in Taiwan that deals with the\nmanufacture of smart city technology, which may suggest an intent to steal intellectual\nproperty, possibly as a means of leveraging the same technology as an instrument of\nsurveillance. Another victim in which the same chain was exhibited is a computer game\nmanufacturer in Cambodia, where the attack could have been used for a different\npurpose, possibly to infiltrate the company’s supply chain. We determined that the\nattackers were able to spread across the network and remain active within it for months,\nwhile making use of various tools. In addition to the infection chain outlined above, we\nfound post-exploitation tools that were not mentioned by the BfV, including a customwritten keylogger and a publicly available SSH and SFTP credential stealer. Interestingly,\nwe were able to observe the presence of a second malware loader on several hosts in the\nnetwork that coincided with the deployment of the HyperBro implant. This loader\nleverages a fake Flash installer implanted with shellcode that is used to fetch a Cobalt\nStrike payload from a remote C2 server. At the time of writing, we can only assess with\nmedium confidence that this tool is indeed associated with the group’s activity, indicating\na possible sharing of initial access to the network with an external entity, or usage of\nCobalt Strike as an alternative to HyperBro in the case of unsuccessful deployment.\n\n## Middle East\n\nWhile hunting for malicious modules for Microsoft IIS servers, we identified a poorly\ndetected and widely deployed module that we call XTest. XTest is based on the publicly\navailable IIS-Raid open source, and was identified on hundreds of servers in late\nFebruary, with 95 percent of them still being compromised at the time of our report. We\nwere not able to determine the exact purpose XTest serves the threat actors, but we\nbelieve, with low confidence, that the module may have been deployed as part of\nmalicious activities from the APT35 actor (aka Charming Kitten and Phosphorus).\n\n## Southeast Asia and Korean Peninsula\n\nWe reported recent, ongoing malicious activity that we attribute to the threat actor\nSidecopy, targeting government staff in India. In addition to the known malware types\ndeployed in past campaigns by this actor, such as MargulasRAT, we identified a cluster of\nactivity targeting Linux and macOS platforms, including an unknown Golang-based Linux\nRAT that we attribute exclusively to this group. The supporting infrastructure for this\noperation overlaps with an operation described in a report published by Cisco Talos in\nSeptember 2021, which discusses a campaign targeting government personnel in India\n\n\n-----\n\nusing Netwire and Warzone (aka AveMaria RAT) dating back to the end of 2020.\nAccording to the authors, the decoys, used in malicious documents and spread in the\nearly stages of these operations, resemble the one used by TransparentTribe (aka APT36\nand Mythic Leopard) and Sidecopy. Our private report provides additional and updated\nindicators of compromise (IoCs) in the context of the same campaign and a description of\nsome Linux and macOS malware that the group behind it has recently adopted.\n\nWe identified three campaigns linked to the Konni threat actor, active since mid-2021,\ntargeting Russian diplomatic entities. While the attackers used the same Konni RAT\nimplant throughout the different campaigns, the infection vectors were different in each\ncampaign: documents containing embedded macros, an installer masquerading as a\nCOVID-19 registration application and, finally, a downloader with a new year screensaver\ndecoy. We also identified post-exploitation tools exclusively used by Konni following a\nsuccessful infection. These are capable of taking screenshots of the active window,\ndeploying a keylogger or listing the connected USB devices and their content. The tools\nalign with the threat actor’s goal of stealing sensitive information from infected systems.\nWe found overlaps in the infrastructure used by a tunneling tool used by the actor and\nseveral possible phishing websites set up within the above time frame. One of the\nregistered domains shared similarities with another domain attributed to TA406 that,\naccording to ProofPoint, incorporates the Konni APT.\n\nMonitoring APT10 activities, we discovered new variants of its tools being used against\nthe same targets as in previous campaigns – Japanese government agencies and\ndiplomatic entities. We have seen versions of the LODEINFO backdoor through v0.4.7,\nv0.4.8, v0.4.9, v0.5.6, and v0.5.8 from January to December 2021, while Lilim RAT\nreceived an update to v1.4.1 in June 2021. In 2020, we published private reports featuring\nLODEINFO, a sophisticated fileless malware first mentioned in a blogpost from\nJPCERT/CC3. In these reports, we mentioned new families of fileless malware known as\nDOWNJPIT and Lilim RAT, which replaced the existing tools of the trade. Further, we\ndisclosed, with high confidence, that LODEINFO and its related activities were attributed\nto APT10, the infamous Chinese-speaking actor. Our latest report on this subject includes\ntechnical analysis of the new versions of LODEINFO and Lilim RAT and reviews updates\nto the malware. In particular, LODEINFO v0.5.6 and v0.5.8 introduced obfuscated\nbackdoor command identifiers to slow down the reversing process. They also\nimplemented the Vigenere cipher to evade detection by certain security products.\n\nWe recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application, compiled in November 2021. This\napplication contains a legitimate program called DeFi Wallet, that saves and manages a\ncryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a malicious file when executed. This malware is a\nfully featured backdoor containing sufficient capabilities to control the compromised\nvictim. After looking into the functionalities of this backdoor, we discovered numerous\noverlaps with other tools used by the Lazarus group. The malware operator exclusively\nused compromised web servers located in South Korea for this attack. To take over the\nservers, we worked closely with a local CERT and, as a result of this effort, we had the\nopportunity to investigate a Lazarus group C2 server The threat actor configured this\n\n\n-----\n\ninfrastructure with servers set up as multiple stages. The first stage is the source for the\nbackdoor, while the purpose of the second stage server is to communicate with the\nimplants. This represents a common scheme for Lazarus infrastructure. From the log files\noriginating from the C2 servers, a number of infected hosts are visible. By only using IP\naddresses we weren’t able to confirm the exact victims of this campaign, given that some\nmay belong to researchers, but they did reveal that this attack targeted entities and/or\nindividuals at a global level.\n\nSince October 2021, the Sidewinder threat actor has been using new malicious JS code\nwith recently created C2 server domains. The attack targets victims with spear-phishing\nemails containing malicious OOXML files. The OOXML files have an external reference to\nthe attacker’s server and download an RTF document exploiting the CVE-2017-11882\nvulnerability. The RTF documents have an embedded JS script in an OLE object that is\ndropped onto the victim’s machine. Sidewinder has been using this infection chain for\nover a year; we provided details of these modules and described further payloads in our\nprevious report. Our last report, in November, showed that Sidewinder’s use of the\nobfuscated JS script has decreased in recent months. Closer investigation of the attacks\nperformed in that period revealed dozens of detections of a new obfuscation technique\nused in their JS script, while the rest of the infection chain remained fairly consistent. The\nnew attacks use the same infection chain, targeting other victims from their traditional\nvictim profile as well as a number of victims in countries that were not traditionally of\ninterest to SideWinder, such as Singapore. The timestamp of the detections and the\nregistration of the servers used by Sidewinder in these attacks suggest that they started\npreparing the infrastructure and registering domains for their new wave of attacks in late\nSeptember. In early October they updated their toolset with new JS obfuscation\ntechniques, and while they continued the use of their old obfuscation routine for a while,\nthey have slowly switched completely to the new one. We described the attacks using the\nnew obfuscated JS scripts in our most recent private report. The attackers also used a new\ntechnique to reduce the suspicion raised by some of their spear-phishing documents that\nhad no text content. They followed their first attempt to attack the victim – a spearphishing email containing a malicious RTF exploit file – with another similar email, but\nin this case the title of the malicious document was “_Apology Letter.docx”, and it\ncontained some text explaining that the previous email was sent in error and that they are\nreaching out to apologize for that mistake.\n\nIn January, a trusted source forwarded a suspicious email to us. This email is disguised as\nan invitation from the renowned PyeongChang Peace forum and contains a DropBox link\nin the email body. The fetched file from the DropBox link contains a malicious Windows\nshortcut file capable of downloading the next stage payload from the attacker’s server.\nFortunately, we were able to acquire the samples from the remote server. We dubbed this\nmalware Phontena; and our analysis revealed the entire infection chain of this attack,\nmade up of multiple stages. From our telemetry, we discovered a full-featured backdoor\nthat is probably the final payload of this infection. After analyzing the samples from the\nremote server, we recognized that the actor behind this attack was associated with\n\n\n-----\n\ninformation published by another vendor about a threat actor named APT-C-601 or APTQ-122. Based on the malware sample we discovered, we assess that this group has many\noverlaps with the DarkHotel group. Malware used in previous DarkHotel activity, as well\nas the samples discovered as part of this research, has very similar C2 communication\nand internal mechanisms. Moreover, the malware author left Korean comments in one of\nthe stager payloads.\n\nTwo years after we first reported the activities of a threat actor we named\nFishingElephant, the group continues to target victims in Bangladesh and Pakistan. While\nwe identified the use of a new keylogger by FishingElephant, it appears that the group still\nmainly relies on the same TTPs (such as payload and communication patterns) that were\ncovered in our initial reports.\n\nToddyCat, a relatively new APT actor, is responsible for multiple attacks detected since\nDecember 2020. In the first wave of attacks, dubbed Websiic, the attackers exploited a\nProxyLogon vulnerability to compromise Exchange Servers of high-profile organizations\nin Europe and Asia. More recently, we detected a new set of attacks against desktop\nmachines starting in September 2021, named Ninja by the attacker. This Trojan provides\na large set of commands allowing the attackers to control target computers. Some\ncapabilities we analyzed are similar to those provided in other notorious post-exploitation\ntoolkits.\n\n## Other interesting discoveries\n\nIn December we were made aware of a UEFI firmware-level compromise through logs\n[from our firmware scanning technology. Further analysis showed that the attackers](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/wiki-section/products/anti-rootkit-and-remediation-technology)\nmodified a single component within the firmware to append a payload to one of its\nsections and incorporate inline hooks within particular functions. These changes allowed\nthe attackers to intercept the original flow of the firmware code and have it executed\nalongside a sophisticated infection chain. The introduced malicious flow, in turn, is in\ncharge of persistently executing a malware stager from a Windows service once the\noperating system is running. By examining other IoCs from the same network, we\ngathered a trove of evidence that led us to assess, with medium-to-high confidence, that\nthe threat actor involved is closely tied to the APT41 group. More specifically, we\ninspected communication of other nodes in the same network to infrastructure related to\nthe server from which the payload is retrieved by the malicious stager. This traffic\noriginated from an in-memory modular implant dubbed ScrambleCross, known to be in\nuse by APT41 or a closely affiliated actor. Although we have covered several UEFI-based\ninfections in APT reports in the last few months, those were cases operating through\nmodifications introduced to the Windows boot loader image, which resides on the ESP\npartition on disk and can be remediated through a reinstallation of the operating system.\nIn this case, however, the malware was found in an image typically based in the SPI flash,\nwhich is outside the hard disk and therefore withstands formatting or disk replacement.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is only the third known case found in the wild of a\n[comparable UEFI implant following LowJax and MosaicRegressor](https://securelist.com/absolute-computrace-revisited/58278/)\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile hunting for recent Deathstalker intrusions, we identified a new Janicab variant\nused in targeting legal entities in the Middle East during 2020, possibly active into early\n2021 and potentially extending an extensive campaign that can be traced back to early\n2015 targeting legal, financial and travel organizations in the Middle East and Europe.\nJanicab was first introduced in 2013 as malware able to run on macOS and Windows\noperating systems. The Windows version has a VBS script-based implant as the final\nstage, instead of the C#/PowerShell combination observed previously in Powersing\nsamples. The VBS-based implant samples we have identified to date have a range of\nversion numbers, meaning it was, and still is, in development. Overall, Janicab shows the\nsame functionalities as its counterpart malware families, but instead of downloading\nseveral tools later in the intrusion lifecycle, as the group used to do with EVILNUM and\nPowersing intrusions, the analyzed samples have most of the tools embedded and\nobfuscated within the dropper. Interestingly, the threat actor continues to use YouTube,\nGoogle+, and WordPress web services as Dead Drop Resolvers (DDRs). However, some of\nthe YouTube links observed are unlisted and go back to 2015, indicating possible re-use of\ninfrastructure. Law firms and financial institutions remain the sectors most affected by\nDeathStalker. However, in the intrusions we analyzed recently, we suspect that travel\nagencies are a new vertical that we haven’t previously seen this threat actor targeting.\n\nWe recently identified additional malicious activities, conducted by Tomiris operators\nsince at least October 2021, against government, telecoms and engineering organizations\nin Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and Russia. In July 2021, we reported the previously\n[unknown Tomiris Golang backdoor, deployed against government organizations within a](https://securelist.com/darkhalo-after-solarwinds-the-tomiris-connection/104311/)\nCIS country through DNS hijacking. We exposed similarities between DarkHalo’s\nSunShuttle backdoor and the Tomiris implant. Later in 2021, we uncovered associated\nmalicious activities that also used the open-source RATel implant to target several\ngovernment organizations within Russia and Central Asia, while drawing an additional\npossible link between Tomiris operators and UNC1514.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nWhile the TTPs of some threat actors remain consistent over time, relying heavily on\nsocial engineering as a means of gaining a foothold in a target organization or\ncompromising an individual’s device, others refresh their toolsets and extend the scope of\ntheir activities. Our regular quarterly reviews are intended to highlight the key\ndevelopments of APT groups.\n\nHere are the main trends that we’ve seen in Q1 2022:\n\nGeopolitics has always been a key driver of APT developments; never more so than\nduring a period of open warfare, as illustrated by the various cyberattacks related to\nthe conflict in Ukraine. We have, of course, seen other activity centered around\ngeopolitics, including the Konni and APT10 campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the trends we discussed in our 2021 APT review and predictions for 2022\nwas the further development of low-level implants. Moonbounce provides a striking\nexample of this trend.\n\nAs always, we would note that our reports are the product of our visibility into the threat\nlandscape. However, it should be borne in mind that, while we strive to continually\nimprove, there is always the possibility that other sophisticated attacks may fly under our\nradar.\n\nAPT trends report Q1 2022\n\nYour email address will not be published.
