See the_ _[ATT&CK for Enterprise for](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/enterprise/)_\n_all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques._\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) are engaged in addressing a spearphishing campaign targeting\ngovernment organizations, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), and non-governmental\norganizations (NGOs). A sophisticated cyber threat actor leveraged a compromised end-user\naccount from Constant Contact, a legitimate email marketing software company, to spoof a\n[U.S.-based government organization and distribute links to malicious URLs.[1] CISA and FBI](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/)\nhave not determined that any individual accounts have been specifically targeted by this\ncampaign.\n\n**Note: CISA and FBI acknowledge open-source reporting attributing the activity discussed in**\n[the report to APT29 (also known as Nobelium, The Dukes, and Cozy Bear).[2,3] However,](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/)\nCISA and FBI are investigating this activity and have not attributed it to any threat actor at\nthis time. CISA and FBI will update this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory as new information\nbecomes available.

A cyber threat actor\nleveraged a compromised end-user account from Constant Contact a legitimate email\n\n\n-----\n\nmarketing software company, to send phishing emails to more than 7,000 accounts across\napproximately 350 government organizations, IGOs, and NGOs. The threat actor sent\nspoofed emails that appeared to originate from a U.S. Government organization. The emails\n[contained a legitimate Constant Contact link that redirected to a malicious URL [T1566.002,](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1566/002/)\n[T1204.001], from which a malicious ISO file was dropped onto the victim’s machine.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1204/001/)\n\nThe ISO file contained (1) a malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) named Documents.dll\n\n[[T1055.001], which is a custom Cobalt Strike Beacon version 4 implant, (2) a malicious](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1055/001/)\n[shortcut file that executes the Cobalt Strike Beacon loader [T1105], and (3) a benign decoy](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1105/)\nPDF titled “Foreign Threats to the 2020 US Federal Elections” with file name “ICAdeclass.pdf” (see figure 1). Note: The decoy file appears to be a copy of the declassified\nIntelligence Community Assessment pursuant to Executive Order 13848 Section 1(a), which\nis available at https://www.intelligence.gov/index.php/ic-on-the-record-database/results/1046foreign-threats-to-the-2020-us-federal-elections-intelligence-community-assessment.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Decoy PDF: ICA-declass.pdf\n\n[Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool used to conduct red team operations.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/)\n\n[[4] It contains a number of tools that complement the cyber threat actor’s exploitation efforts,](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/)\nsuch as a keystroke logger, file injection capability, and network services scanners. The\nCobalt Strike Beacon is the malicious implant that calls back to attacker-controlled\ninfrastructure and checks for additional commands to execute on the compromised system\n\n[[TA0011].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0011/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe configuration file for this Cobalt Strike Beacon implant contained communications\nprotocols, an implant watermark, and the following hardcoded command and control (C2)\ndomains:\n```\n   dataplane.theyardservice[.]com/jquery-3.3.1.min.woff2\n   cdn.theyardservice[.]com/jquery-3.3.1.min.woff2\n   static.theyardservice[.]com/jquery-3.3.1.min.woff2\n   worldhomeoutlet[.]com/jquery-3.3.1.min.woff2\n\n```\nThe configuration file was encoded via an XOR with the key `0x2e and a 16-bit byte swap.`\n\nFor more information on the ISO file and Cobalt Strike Beacon implant, including IOCs, refer\n[to Malware Analysis Report MAR-10339794-1.v1: Cobalt Strike Beacon.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-148a)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nThe following IOCS were derived from trusted third parties and open-source research.

While privileged\naccounts and remote access systems are critical, it is also important to ensure full\ncoverage across SaaS solutions. Enabling MFA for corporate communications\nplatforms (as with all other accounts) provides vital defense against these types of\nattacks and, in many cases, can prevent them.\nKeep all software up to date. The most effective cybersecurity programs quickly update\nall of their software as soon as patches are available. If your organization is unable to\nupdate all software shortly after a patch is released, prioritize implementing patches for\nCVEs that are already known to be exploited.\nImplement endpoint and detection response (EDR) tools. EDR allows a high degree of\nvisibility into the security status of endpoints and is can be an effective tool against\nthreat actors.\n**Note: Organizations using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or Microsoft 365 Defense**\nshould refer to Microsoft: Use attack surface reduction rules to prevent malware\ninfection for more information on hardening the enterprise attack surface.\nImplement centralized log management for host monitoring. A centralized logging\napplication allows technicians to look out for anomalous activity in the network\nenvironment, such as new applications running on hosts, out-of-place communication\nbetween devices, or unaccountable login failures on machines. It also aids in\ntroubleshooting applications or equipment in the event of a fault. CISA and the FBI\nrecommend that organizations:\n\nForward logs from local hosts to a centralized log management server—often\nreferred to as a security information and event management (SIEM) tool.\nEnsure logs are searchable. The ability to search, analyze, and visualize\ncommunications will help analysts diagnose issues and may lead to detection of\nanomalous activity.\nCorrelate logs from both network and host security devices. By reviewing logs\nfrom multiple sources, an organization can better triage an individual event and\ndetermine its impact to the organization as a whole.\nReview both centralized and local log management policies to maximize\nefficiency and retain historical data. Organizations should retain critical logs for a\nminimum of 30 days.\nDeploy signatures to detect and/or block inbound connection from Cobalt Strike servers\nand other post-exploitation tools.\nImplement unauthorized execution prevention by disabling macro scripts from Microsoft\nOffice files transmitted via email. Consider using Office Viewer software to open\nMicrosoft Office files transmitted via email instead of full Microsoft Office suite\napplications.\n\n\n-----\n\nConfigure and maintain user and administrative accounts using a strong account\nmanagement policy.\n\nUse administrative accounts on dedicated administration workstations.\nLimit access to and use of administrative accounts.\nUse strong passwords. For more information on strong passwords, refer to CISA\nTip: Choosing and Protecting Passwords and National Institute of Standards\n(NIST) SP 800-63: Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle\nManagement.\nRemove default accounts if unneeded. Change the password of default accounts\nthat are needed.\nDisable all unused accounts.\nImplement a user training program and simulated attacks for spearphishing to\ndiscourage users from visiting malicious websites or opening malicious attachments\nand re-enforce the appropriate user responses to spearphishing emails.\n\n## RESOURCES\n\nVolexity Blog: Suspected APT29 Operation Launches Election Fraud Themed Phishing\nCampaigns | Volexity\nMicrosoft Blog: New sophisticated email-based attack from NOBELIUM - Microsoft\nSecurity\nMicrosoft Blog: [Another Nobelium Cyberattack](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/05/27/nobelium-cyberattack-nativezone-solarwinds/)\n\n### Contact Information\n\nTo report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint\nCybersecurity Advisory, contact your local FBI field office at [www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field, or](http://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field)\n[the FBI’s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) at (855) 292-3937 or by e-mail at CyWatch@fbi.gov.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:CyWatch@fbi.gov)\nWhen available, please include the following information regarding the incident: date, time,\nand location of the incident; type of activity; number of people affected; type of equipment\nused for the activity; the name of the submitting company or organization; and a designated\npoint of contact.
