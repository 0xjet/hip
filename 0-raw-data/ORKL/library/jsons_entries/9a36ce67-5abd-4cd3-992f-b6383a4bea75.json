    "plain_text": "**December 20, 2015 | by Ryann Winters, FireEye Threat Intelligence | Threat Research, Targeted Attack**\n\n**On Wednesday, Dec. 16,** **[2015, FireEye published The EPS Awakens](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/12/the_eps_awakens.html)** **, detailing an exploit targeting a**\n**previously unknown Microsoft Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) dict copy use-after-free vulnerability that was**\n**silently patched by Microsoft on November 10, 2015. The blog described the technical details of the**\n**vulnerability, and the steps needed to bypass the EPS filter and obtain full read and write access to the**\n**system memory.**\n\n**In this follow-up blog, we discuss the operational details of the spear phishing campaigns associated with the**\n**exploit. Specifically, we detail the lures, attachments, targeting and malware, and examine the China-based**\n**advanced persistent threat (APT) group responsible for one of the observed attacks.**\n\n**Between November 26, 2015, and December 1, 2015, known and suspected China-based APT groups**\n**launched several spear phishing attacks targeting Japanese and Taiwanese organizations in the high-tech,**\n**government services, media and financial services industries. Each campaign delivered a malicious Microsoft**\n**Word document exploiting the aforementioned EPS dict copy use-after-free vulnerability, and the local**\n**Windows privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2015-1701. The successful exploitation of both vulnerabilities**\n**led to the delivery of either a downloader that we refer to as IRONHALO, or a backdoor that we refer to as**\n**ELMER.**\n\n**On November 26, 2015, a suspected China-based APT group sent Japanese defense policy-themed spear**\n**phishing emails to multiple Japanese financial and high-tech companies. As shown in Figure 1, the emails**\n**originated from the Yahoo! email address mts03282000@yahoo.co[.]jp, and contained the subject “新年[号巻]**\n\n**頭⾔[の送付]” (Google Translation: Sending of New Year No. Foreword).**\n\n**Figure 1. November 26, 2015 Phish SMTP header**\n\n**Each phishing message contained the same malicious Microsoft Word attachment. The malicious attachment**\n**resembled an article hosted on a legitimate Japanese defense-related website, as both discussed national**\n**defense topics and carried the same byline. The lure documents also used the Japanese calendar, as**\n**indicated by the 27th year in the Heisei period. This demonstrates that the threat actors understand**\n**conventional Japanese date notation.**\n\n**Following the exploitation of the EPS and CVE-2015-1701 vulnerabilities, the exploit payload drops either a**\n\n\n-----\n\n**(CnC) server and uniform resource locator (URL) path.**\n\n**The encoded payload is written to a temporary file, decoded and executed in a hidden window. The encoded**\n**and decoded payloads are written to files named igfxHK[%rand%].dat and** **igfxHK[%rand%].exe**\n**respectively, where [%rand%] is a 4-byte hexadecimal number based on the current timestamp.**\n\n**Table 1. IRONHALO artifacts**\n\n**IRONHALO persists by copying itself to the current user’s Startup folder. This variant sends an HTTP request**\n**to a legitimate Japanese website using a malformed User-Agent string, as shown in Figure 2. The threat**\n**actors likely compromised the legitimate site and attempted to use it as a staging server for second-stage**\n**payloads.**\n\n**Figure 2. IRONHALO HTTP GET request**\n\n**On December 1, 2015, threat actors launched two additional spear phishing attacks exploiting the**\n**undisclosed EPS vulnerability and CVE-2015-1701. Unlike the Nov. 26 campaign, these attacks targeted**\n**Taiwanese governmental and media and entertainment organizations. Moreover, the exploit dropped a**\n**different malware payload, a backdoor we refer to as ELMER.**\n\n**The first spear phishing message was sent to a Taiwanese governmental employee on Dec. 1. The**\n**attachment was created using the traditional Chinese character set, and contained a flowchart that appeared**\n**to be taken from the legitimate Taiwanese government auction website**\n**hxxp://shwoo.gov[.]taipei/buyer_flowchart.asp. The image, shown in Figure 3, is a flowchart detailing how**\n**to place a trade on the Taipei Nature and Cherish Network website.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3: Lure Image**\n\n**The second December spear phishing attack targeted Taiwan-based news media organizations The emails**\n\n\n-----\n\n**threat actors may have tried to make the message appear to be a legitimate communication from the**\n**Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Taiwan’s opposition party.**\n\n**Figure 4. December 1 Lure 2 SMTP Header**\n\n**Unlike the previous exploit documents, this malicious attachment did not contain any visible text when opened**\n**in Microsoft Word.**\n\n**The exploit documents delivered during the December campaigns dropped a binary containing an embedded**\n**variant of a backdoor we refer to as ELMER. ELMER is a non-persistent proxy-aware HTTP backdoor written**\n**in Delphi, and is capable of performing file uploads and downloads, file execution, and process and directory**\n**listings.**\n\n**To retrieve commands, ELMER sends HTTP GET requests to a hard-coded CnC server, and parses the**\n**HTTP response packets received from the CnC server for an integer string corresponding to the command**\n**that needs to be executed. Table 2 lists the ELMER backdoors observed during the December campaigns.**\n\n**Table 2. ELMER variants**\n\n**The ELMER variant 6c33223db475f072119fe51a2437a542 beaconed to the CnC IP address 121.127.249.74**\n**over port 443. However the ELMER sample 0b176111ef7ec98e651ffbabf9b35a18 beaconed to the CnC**\n**domain news.rinpocheinfo[.]com over port 443. Both samples used the hard-coded User-Agent string**\n**“Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)”, as shown in Figure 5.**\n\n**Figure 5 ELMER beacon**\n\n\n-----\n\n**While attribution of the first two spear phishing attacks is still uncertain, we attribute the second December**\n**phishing campaign to the China-based APT group that we refer to as APT16. This is based on the use of the**\n**known APT16 domain rinpocheinfo[.]com, as well as overlaps in previously observed targeting and tactics,**\n**techniques and procedures (TTPs).**\n\n**Taiwanese citizens will go to the polls on January 16, 2016, to choose a new President and legislators.**\n**According to recent opinion polls, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Tsai Ing-wen is leading**\n**her opponents and is widely expected to win the election. The DPP is part of the pan-green coalition that**\n**favors Taiwanese independence over reunification with the mainland, and the party’s victory would represent**\n**a shift away from the ruling Kuomintang’s closer ties with the PRC. Since 1949, Beijing has claimed Taiwan as**\n**a part of China and strongly opposes any action toward independence. The Chinese government is therefore**\n**concerned whether a DPP victory might weaken the commercial and tourism ties between China and Taiwan,**\n**or even drive Taiwan closer to independence. In 2005, the Chinese government passed an “anti-secession”**\n**law that signified its intention to use “non-peaceful” means to stymie any Taiwanese attempt to secede from**\n**China.**\n\n**APT16 actors sent spear phishing emails to two Taiwanese media organization addresses and three webmail**\n**addresses. The message subject read “DPP’s Contact Information Update”, apparently targeting those**\n**interested in contact information for DPP members or politicians. The Chinese government would benefit from**\n**improved insight into local media coverage of Taiwanese politics, both to better anticipate the election**\n**outcome and to gather additional intelligence on politicians, activists, and others who interact with journalists.**\n**[This tactic is not without precedent; in 2013, the New York Times revealed it had been the target of China-](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/technology/chinese-hackers-infiltrate-new-york-times-computers.html)**\n**[based actors shortly after it reported on the alleged mass accumulation of wealth by then-Prime Minister Wen](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html)**\n**Jiabao and his family. The actors likely sought information on the newspaper’s sources in China, who could be**\n**silenced by the government.**\n\n**Compromising these Taiwanese news organizations would also allow the actors to gain access to informants**\n**or other protected sources, who might then be targeted for further intelligence collection or even retribution.**\n**The webmail addresses, while unknown, were possibly the personal-use addresses of the individuals whose**\n**corporate domain emails were targeted. As corporate networks become more secure and users become more**\n**vigilant, personal accounts can still offer a means to bypass security systems. This tactic exploits users’**\n**reduced vigilance when reading their own personal email, even when using corporate IT equipment to do so.**\n\n**On the same date that APT16 targeted Taiwanese media, suspected Chinese APT actors also targeted a**\n**Taiwanese government agency, sending a lure document that contained instructions for registration and**\n**subsequent listing of goods on a local Taiwanese auction website. It is possible, although not confirmed, that**\n**APT16 was also responsible for targeting this government agency, given both the timeframe and the use of**\n**the same n-day to eventually deploy the ELMER backdoor.**\n\n**One of the media organizations involved in this latest activity was targeted in June 2015, while its Hong Kong**\n**branch was similarly targeted in August 2015. APT16 actors were likely also responsible for the June 2015**\n**activity. They sent spear phishing messages with the subject “2015 Taiwan Security and Cultural Forum**\n**Invitation Form” (2015台灣[安全⽂化論壇邀請函]), and used a different tool – a tool that we refer to as**\n**DOORJAMB – in their attempt to compromise the organization. A different group, known as admin@338,**\n**[used LOWBALL malware during its Hong Kong activity. Despite the differing sponsorship, penetration of Hong](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/11/china-based-threat.html)**\n**Kong and Taiwan based media organizations continues to be a priority for China based threat groups**\n\n\n-----\n\n**different groups based on their targets geographic location. In other words, while media organizations are**\n**important targets, it is possible that two separate groups are responsible for Hong Kong and Taiwan,**\n**respectively. The suspected APT16 targeting of the Taiwanese government agency – in addition to the**\n**Taiwanese media organizations – further supports this possibility.**\n\n**Table 3 contains a summary of the phishing activity detailed in this blog.**\n\n**Table 3. Activity summary**\n\n**These clusters of activity raise interesting questions about the use of an identical silently-patched vulnerability,**\n**possibly by multiple threat groups. Both Japan and Taiwan are important intelligence collection targets for**\n**China, particularly because of recent changes to Japan’s pacifist constitution and the upcoming Taiwanese**\n**election. Based on our visibility and available data, we only attribute one campaign to the Chinese APT group**\n**APT16. Nonetheless, the evidence suggests the involvement of China-based groups.**\n\n**This entry was posted on Sun Dec 20 19:45:00 EST 2015 and filed under Blog, Cyber Threats, FireEye**\n**Threat Intelligence, Latest Blog Posts, Ryann Winters, Spear Phishing, Targeted Attack and Threat**\n**Research.**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Last Name\n\n\n**Cyber Security Fundamentals**\n\n**Careers**\n\n**Events**\n\n**Webinars**\n\n**Support**\n\n**Partners**\n\n\n## First Name\n\n\n-----\n\n**Blog**\n\n**[Investor Relations](http://investors.fireeye.com/)**\n\n**Incident?**\n\n**Contact Us**\n\n**[Communication Preferences](https://www2.fireeye.com/manage-your-preferences.html)**\n\n**Report Security Issue**\n\n**Supplier Documents**\n\n\n# � � � � � �\n\n\n**[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FireEye)**\n\n**[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fireeye)**\n\n**[Twitter](https://twitter.com/fireeye)**\n\n**[Google+](https://plus.google.com/+Fireeye/videos)**\n\n**[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/FireEyeInc)**\n\n**[Glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-FireEye-EI_IE235161.11,18.htm)**\n\n\n**Copyright © 2015 FireEye, Inc.
