Over the past few years, Animal Farm has targeted a wide range of\nglobal organizations. Victims include:\n\nGovernment organizations\nMilitary contractors\nHumanitarian aid organizations\nPrivate companies\nJournalists and media organizations\nActivists\n\n[Our colleagues at Cyphort, G-DATA and ESET have recently published blogs about](http://www.cyphort.com/babar-suspected-nation-state-spyware-spotlight/)\nBunny, Casper and Babar, some of the Trojans used by the Animal Farm group.\n\nThe Farm includes several Trojans, which we have grouped into six major families:\n\nHere’s a brief description of the animals in the farm:\n\n**Bunny** an old “validator” style Trojan used with a PDF zero day attack in 2011\n\n\n-----\n\n**Babar – the most sophisticated espionage platform from the Animal Farm group.**\n**NBot – malware used in a botnet-style operation by the group. It has DDoS**\ncapabilities.\n**Tafacalou – a validator-style Trojan used by the attackers in recent years.**\nConfirmed victims get upgraded to Dino or Babar.\n**Casper – the most recent “validator”-style implant from the Animal Farm group.**\n\nThe group has been active since at least 2009 and there are signs that earlier malware\nversions were developed as far back as 2007.\n\nOver the years we have tracked multiple campaigns by the Animal Farm group. These\ncan be identified by a specific code found either in the malware configuration or\nextracted from the C&C logs.\n\nMost recently, the group deployed the Casper Trojan via a watering-hole attack in\n[Syria. A full description of this zero-day attack can be found in this blog post by](https://securelist.com/new-flash-player-0-day-cve-2014-0515-used-in-watering-hole-attacks/59399/)\nKaspersky Lab’s Vyacheslav Zakorzhevsky.\n\nIn addition to these, the Animal Farm attackers used at least one unknown, mysterious\nmalware during an operation targeting computer users in Burkina Faso.\n\n## KSN & Sinkholing statistics\n\nDuring the investigation we sinkholed a large number of C&C servers used by the\nAnimal Farm group. This allowed us to compile a comprehensive picture of both\ntargets and victims.\n\n\n-----\n\ninterest here, because it acts as an entry point for the more sophisticated spy\nplatforms Babar and Dino. Based on the Tafacalou infection logs, we observed that\nmost of the victims are in the following countries: Syria, Iran, Malaysia, USA, China,\nTurkey, Netherlands, Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Sweden, Austria, Algeria, Israel,\nIraq, Morocco, New Zealand, Ukraine.\n\n## What does “Tafacalou” mean?\n\n“Tafacalou” is the attacker’s internal name for one of the validator (1st stage) Trojans.\nWe tried various spellings of this word to see if it means anything in a specific\nlanguage, and the most interesting option is one with its origins in the Occitan\nlanguage: “Ta Fa Calou.”\n\nThe expression “Fa Calou” is the French interpretation of the Occitane “Fa Calor” which\nmeans “it’s getting hot” (see http://ejournaux.blogspot.com/2008/07/la-langueoccitane-et-ses-quelques.html). ‘Ta Fa Calou” could therefore be taken to mean “so it’s\ngetting hot” based on the Occitan language.\n\n[According to Wikipedia: ‘Occitan is a Romance language spoken in southern France, Italy’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitan_language)\n_Occitan Valleys, Monaco, and Spain’s Val d’Aran; collectively, these regions are sometimes_\n_referred to unofficially as “Occitania”._\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Kaspersky Intelligent Services.
