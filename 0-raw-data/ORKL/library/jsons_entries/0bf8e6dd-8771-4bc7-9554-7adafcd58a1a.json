DNS is a foundational technology supporting the Internet. Manipulating that system has the\npotential to undermine the trust users have on the internet. That trust and the stability of the DNS system\nas a whole drives the global economy. Responsible nations should avoid targeting this system, work\ntogether to establish an accepted global norm that this system and the organizations that control it are offlimits, and cooperate in pursuing those actors who act irresponsibly by targeting this system.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nCisco Talos has discovered a new cyber threat campaign that we are calling \"Sea Turtle,\" which is targeting\npublic and private entities, including national security organizations, located primarily in the Middle East and\nNorth Africa. The ongoing operation likely began as early as January 2017 and has continued through the\nfirst quarter of 2019. Our investigation revealed that at least 40 different organizations across 13 different\ncountries were compromised during this campaign. We assess with high confidence that this activity is\nbeing carried out by an advanced, state-sponsored actor that seeks to obtain persistent access to sensitive\nnetworks and systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe actors behind this campaign have focused on using DNS hijacking as a mechanism for achieving their\nultimate objectives. DNS hijacking occurs when the actor can illicitly modify DNS name records to point\nusers to actor-controlled servers. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an [alert about this](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/AA19-024A)\nactivity on Jan. 24 2019, warning that an attacker could redirect user traffic and obtain valid encryption\ncertificates for an organization's domain names.\n\nIn the Sea Turtle campaign, Talos was able to identify two distinct groups of victims. The first group, we\nidentify as primary victims, includes national security organizations, ministries of foreign affairs, and\nprominent energy organizations. The threat actor targeted third-party entities that provide services to these\nprimary entities to obtain access. Targets that fall into the secondary victim category include numerous DNS\nregistrars, telecommunication companies, and internet service providers. One of the most notable aspects\nof this campaign was how they were able to perform DNS hijacking of their primary victims by first targeting\nthese third-party entities.\n\nWe assess with high confidence that these operations are distinctly different and independent from the\noperations performed by DNSpionage, which we [reported on in November 2018. The Sea Turtle campaign](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/11/dnspionage-campaign-targets-middle-east.html)\nalmost certainly poses a more severe threat than DNSpionage given the actor's methodology in targeting\nvarious DNS registrars and registries. The level of access we presume necessary to engage in DNS\nhijacking successfully indicates an ongoing, high degree of threat to organizations in the targeted regions.\nDue to the effectiveness of this approach, we encourage all organizations, globally, to ensure they have\ntaken steps to minimize the possibility of malicious actors duplicating this attack methodology.\n\nThe threat actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign show clear signs of being highly capable and brazen in\ntheir endeavors. The actors are responsible for the first [publicly confirmed case against an organizations](https://www.netnod.se/news/statement-on-man-in-the-middle-attack-against-netnod)\nthat manages a root server zone, highlighting the attacker's sophistication. Notably, the threat actors have\ncontinued their attacks despite public reports documenting various aspects of their activity, suggesting they\nare unusually brazen and may be difficult to deter going forward. In most cases, threat actors typically stop\nor slow down their activities once their campaigns are publicly revealed.\n\nThis post provides the technical findings you would typically see in a Talos blog. We will also offer some\ncommentary on the threat actor's tradecraft, including possible explanations about the actor's attack\nmethodology and thought process. Finally, we will share the IOCs that we have observed thus far, although\nwe are confident there are more that we have not seen.\n\n### Background on Domain Name Services and records management\n\nThe threat actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign were successful in compromising entities by\nmanipulating and falsifying DNS records at various levels in the domain name space. This section provides\na brief overview of where DNS records are managed and how they are accessed to help readers better\nunderstand how these events unfolded.\n\nThe first and most direct way to access an organization's DNS records is through the registrar with the\nregistrant's credentials. These credentials are used to login to the DNS provider from the client-side, which\nis a registrar. If an attacker was able to compromise an organization's network administrator credentials, the\nattacker would be able to change that particular organization's DNS records at will.\n\nThe second way to access DNS records is through a DNS registrar, sometimes called registrar operators. A\nregistrar sells domain names to the public and manages DNS records on behalf of the registrant through\nthe domain registry. Records in the domain registry are accessed through the registry application using the\nExtensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP). EPP was detailed in the [request for comment (RFC) 5730 as \"a](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5730)\n\n\n-----\n\nmeans of interaction between a registrar s applications and registry applications. If the attackers were able\nto obtain one of these EPP keys, they would be able to modify any DNS records that were managed by that\nparticular registrar.\n\nThe third approach to gain access to DNS records is through one of the registries. These registries manage\nany known TLD, such as entire country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) and generic top-level domains\n(gTLDs). For example, Verisign manages all entities associated with the top-level domain (TLD) \".com.\" All\nthe different registry information then converges into one of [12 different organization that manage different](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers)\nparts of the domain registry root. The domain registry root is stored on 13 \"named authorities in the\ndelegation data for the root zone,\" according to [ICANN.](https://www.icann.org/news/blog/there-are-not-13-root-servers)\n\nFinally, actors could target root zone servers to modify the records directly. It is important to note that there\nis no evidence during this campaign (or any other we are aware of) that the root zone servers were\nattacked or compromised. We highlight this as a potential avenue that attackers would consider. The root\nDNS servers issued a [joint statement that stated, \"There are no signs of lost integrity or compromise of the](https://root-servers.org/news/20190314-Rootops_statement_Integrity_of_root_server_system.pdf)\ncontent of the root [server] zone…There are no signs of clients having received unexpected responses\nfrom root servers.\"\n\n### Assessed Sea Turtle DNS hijacking methodology\n\nIt is important to remember that the DNS hijacking is merely a means for the attackers to achieve their\nprimary objective. Based on observed behaviors, we believe the actor ultimately intended to steal\ncredentials to gain access to networks and systems of interest. To achieve their goals, the actors behind\nSea Turtle:\n\n1. Established a means to control the DNS records of the target.\n2. Modified DNS records to point legitimate users of the target to actor-controlled servers.\n3. Captured legitimate user credentials when users interacted with these actor-controlled servers.\n\nThe diagram below illustrates how we believe the actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign used DNS\nhijacking to achieve their end goals.\n\n### Redirection Attack Methodology Diagram\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### Operational tradecraft\n\n#### Initial access\n\nThe threat actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign gained initial access either by exploiting known\nvulnerabilities or by sending spear-phishing emails. Talos believes that the threat actors have exploited\nmultiple known CVEs to either gain initial access or to move laterally within an affected organization. Based\non our research, we know the actor utilizes the following known exploits:\n\n[CVE-2009-1151: PHP code injection vulnerability affecting phpMyAdmin](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2009-1151)\n[CVE-2014-6271: RCE affecting GNU bash system, specifically the SMTP (this was part of the](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-6271)\n[Shellshock CVEs)](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-268A)\n[CVE-2017-3881: RCE by unauthenticated user with elevated privileges Cisco switches](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-3881)\n[CVE-2017-6736: Remote Code Exploit (RCE) for Cisco integrated Service Router 2811](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6736)\n[CVE-2017-12617: RCE affecting Apache web servers running Tomcat](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12617)\n[CVE-2018-0296: Directory traversal allowing unauthorized access to Cisco Adaptive Security](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0296)\nAppliances (ASAs) and firewalls\n[CVE-2018-7600: RCE for Website built with Drupal, aka \"Drupalgeddon\"](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7600)\n\nAs of early 2019, the only evidence of the spear-phishing threat vector came from a compromised\norganization's public disclosure. On January 4, Packet Clearing House, which is not an Internet exchange\npoint but rather is an NGO which provides support to Internet exchange points and the core of the domain\nname system, provided confirmation of this aspect of the actors’ tactics when it publicly revealed its internal\nDNS had been briefly hijacked as a consequence of the compromise at its domain registrar.\n\nAs with any initial access involving a sophisticated actor, we believe this list of CVEs to be incomplete. The\nactor in question can leverage known vulnerabilities as they encounter a new threat surface. This list only\nrepresents the observed behavior of the actor, not their complete capabilities.\n\n### Globalized DNS hijacking activity as an infection vector\n\nDuring a typical incident, the actor would modify the NS records for the targeted organization, pointing\nusers to a malicious DNS server that provided actor-controlled responses to all DNS queries. The amount\nof time that the targeted DNS record was hijacked can range from a couple of minutes to a couple of days.\nThis type of activity could give an attacker the ability to redirect any victim who queried for that particular\ndomain around the world. [Other cybersecurity firms previously reported some aspects of this activity. Once](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/widespread-dns-hijacking-activity-targets-multiple-sectors/)\nthe actor-controlled name server was queried for the targeted domain, it would respond with a falsified \"A\"\nrecord that would provide the IP address of the actor-controlled MitM node instead of the IP address of the\nlegitimate service. In some instances, the threat actors modified the time-to-live (TTL) value to one second.\nThis was likely done to minimize the risk of any records remaining in the DNS cache of the victim machine.\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring 2019, we observe the following name servers being used in support of the Sea Turtle campaign:\n\nDomain Active Timeframe\n\nns1[.]intersecdns[.]com March - April 2019\n\nns2[.]intersecdns[.]com March - April 2019\n\nns1[.]lcjcomputing[.]com January 2019\n\nns2[.]lcjcomputing[.]com January 2019\n\n### Credential harvesting: Man-in-the-middle servers\n\nOnce the threat actors accessed a domain's DNS records, the next step was to set up a man-in-the-middle\n(MitM) framework on an actor-controlled server.\n\nThe next step for the actor was to build MitM servers that impersonated legitimate services to capture user\ncredentials. Once these credentials were captured, the user would then be passed to the legitimate service.\nto evade detection, the actors performed \"certificate impersonation,\" a technique in which the attacker\nobtained a certificate authority-signed X.509 certificate from another provider for the same domain imitating\nthe one already used by the targeted organization. For example, if a DigiCert certificate protected a\nwebsite, the threat actors would obtain a certificate for the same domain but from another provider, such as\nLet's Encrypt or Comodo. This tactic would make detecting the MitM attack more difficult, as a user's web\nbrowser would still display the expected \"SSL padlock\" in the URL bar.\n\nWhen the victim entered their password into the attacker's spoofed webpage, the actor would capture these\ncredentials for future use. The only indication a victim received was a brief lag between when the user\nentered their information and when they obtained access to the service. This would also leave almost no\nevidence for network defenders to discover, as legitimate network credentials were used to access the\naccounts.\n\nIn addition to the MitM server IP addresses published in previous reports, Talos identified 16 additional\nservers leveraged by the actor during the observed attacks. The complete list of known malicious IP\naddresses are in the Indicators of Compromise (IOC) section below.\n\n### Credential harvesting with compromised SSL certificates\n\nOnce the threat actors appeared to have access to the network, they stole the organization's SSL\ncertificate. The attackers would then use the certificate on actor-controlled servers to perform additional\nMitM operations to harvest additional credentials. This allowed the actors to expand their access into the\ntargeted organization's network. The stolen certificates were typically only used for less than one day, likely\nas an operational security measure. Using stolen certificates for an extended period would increase the\nlikelihood of detection. In some cases, the victims were redirected to these actor-controlled servers\ndisplaying the stolen certificate.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne notable aspect of the campaign was the actors ability to impersonate VPN applications, such as Cisco\nAdaptive Security Appliance (ASA) products, to perform MitM attacks. At this time, we do not believe that\nthe attackers found a new ASA exploit. Rather, they likely abused the trust relationship associated with the\nASA's SSL certificate to harvest VPN credentials to gain remote access to the victim's network. This MitM\ncapability would allow the threat actors to harvest additional VPN credentials.\n\nAs an example, DNS records indicate that a targeted domain resolved to an actor-controlled MitM server.\nThe following day, Talos identified an SSL certificate with the subject common name of \"ASA Temporary\nSelf Signed Certificate\" associated with the aforementioned IP address. This certificate was observed on\nboth the actor-controlled IP address and on an IP address correlated with the victim organization.\n\nIn another case, the attackers were able to compromise NetNod, a non-profit, independent internet\ninfrastructure organization based in Sweden. NetNod acknowledged the compromise in a [public statement](https://www.netnod.se/news/statement-on-man-in-the-middle-attack-against-netnod)\non February 5, 2019. Using this access, the threat actors were able to manipulate the DNS records for\nsa1[.]dnsnode[.]net. This redirection allowed the attackers to harvest credentials of administrators who\nmanage domains with the TLD of Saudi Arabia (.sa). It is likely that there are additional Saudi Arabia-based\nvictims from this attack.\n\nIn one of the more recent campaigns on March 27, 2019, the threat actors targeted the Sweden-based\nconsulting firm Cafax. On Cafax's [public webpage, the company states that one of their consultants actively](http://www.cafax.se/Home.html)\nmanages the i[.]root-server[.]net zone. NetNod managed this particular DNS server zone. We assess with\nhigh confidence that this organization was targeted in an attempt to re-establish access to the NetNod\nnetwork, which was previously compromised by this threat actor.\n\n### Primary and secondary victims\n\nWe identified 40 different organizations that have been targeted during this campaign. The victim\norganizations appear to be broadly grouped into two different categories. The first group of victims, which\nwe refer to as primary victims, were almost entirely located in the Middle East and North Africa. Some\nexamples of organizations that were compromised include:\n\nMinistries of foreign affairs\nMilitary organizations\nIntelligence agencies\nProminent energy organizations\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second cluster of victim organizations were likely compromised to help enable access to these primary\ntargets. These organizations were located around the world; however, they were mostly concentrated in the\nMiddle East and North Africa. Some examples of organizations that were compromised include:\n\nTelecommunications organizations\nInternet service providers\nInformation technology firms\nRegistrars\nOne registry\n\nNotably, the threat actors were able to gain access to registrars that manage ccTLDs for Amnic, which is\nlisted as the technical contact on [IANA for the ccTLD .am. Obtaining access to this ccTLD registrars would](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/am.html)\nhave allowed attackers to hijack any domain that used those ccTLDs.\n\n### How is this tradecraft different?\n\nThe threat actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign have proven to be highly capable, as they have been\nable to perform operations for over two years and have been undeterred by public reports documenting\nvarious aspects of their activity. This cyber threat campaign represents the first known case of a domain\nname registry organization that was compromised for cyber espionage operations.\n\nIn order to distinguish this activity from the previous reporting on other attackers, such as those affiliated\nwith DNSpionage, below is a list of traits that are unique to the threat actors behind the Sea Turtle\ncampaign:\n\nThese actors perform DNS hijacking through the use of actor-controlled name servers.\nThese actors have been more aggressive in their pursuit targeting DNS registries and a number of\nregistrars, including those that manage ccTLDs.\nThese actors use Let's Encrypts, Comodo, Sectigo, and self-signed certificates in their MitM servers\nto gain the initial round of credentials.\nOnce they have access to the network, they steal the organization's legitimate SSL certificate and\nuse it on actor-controlled servers.\n\n### Why was it so successful?\n\nWe believe that the Sea Turtle campaign continues to be highly successful for several reasons. First, the\nactors employ a unique approach to gain access to the targeted networks. Most traditional security\nproducts such as IDS and IPS systems are not designed to monitor and log DNS requests. The threat\nactors were able to achieve this level of success because the DNS domain space system added security\ninto the equation as an afterthought. Had more ccTLDs implemented security features such as registrar\nlocks, attackers would be unable to redirect the targeted domains.\n\nThe threat actors also used an interesting techniques called certificate impersonation. This technique was\nsuccessful in part because the SSL certificates were created to provide confidentiality, not integrity. The\nattackers stole organizations' SSL certificates associated with security appliances such as ASA to obtain\nVPN credentials, allowing the actors to gain access to the targeted network.\n\nThe threat actors were able to maintain long term persistent access to many of these networks by utilizing\ncompromised credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe will continue to monitor Sea Turtle and work with our partners to understand the threat as it continues to\nevolve to ensure that our customers remain protected and the public is informed.\n\n### Mitigation strategy\n\nIn order to best protect against this type of attack, we compiled a list of potential actions. Talos suggests\nusing a registry lock service, which will require an out-of-band message before any changes can occur to\nan organization's DNS record. If your registrar does not offer a registry lock service, we recommend\nimplementing multi-factor authentication, such as [DUO, to access your organization's DNS records. If you](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/adaptive-multi-factor-authentication.html)\nsuspect you were targeted by this type of activity intrusion, we recommend instituting a network-wide\npassword reset, preferably from a computer on a trusted network. Lastly, we recommend applying patches,\nespecially on internet-facing machines. Network administrators can monitor passive DNS record on their\ndomains, to check for abnormalities.\n\n### Coverage\n\nCVE-2009-1151: PHP code injection vulnerability affecting phpMyAdmin\n\nSID: [2281](https://snort.org/rule_docs/1-2281)\n\nCVE-2014-6271: RCE affecting GNU bash system, specific the SMTP (this was part of the Shellshock\nCVEs)\n\nSID: [31975 -](https://snort.org/rule_docs/1-31975) [31978,](https://snort.org/rule_docs/1-31978) [31985,](https://snort.org/rule_docs/1-31985) [32038,](https://snort.org/rule_docs/1-32038) [32039,](https://snort.org/rule_docs/1-32039) [32041 -](https://snort.org/rule_docs/1-32041) [32043,](https://snort.org/rule_docs/1-32043) [32069,](https://snort.org/rule_docs/1-32069) [32335,](https://snort.org/rule_docs/1-32335) [32336](https://snort.org/rule_docs/1-32336)\n\nCVE-2017-3881: RCE for Cisco switches\n\nSID: [41909 -](https://snort.org/rule_docs/1-41909) [41910](https://snort.org/rule_docs/1-41910)\n\nCVE-2017-6736: Remote Code Exploit (RCE) for Cisco integrated Service Router 2811\n\nSID: [43424 -](https://snort.org/rule_docs/3-43424) [43432](https://snort.org/rule_docs/3-43432)\n\nCVE-2017-12617: RCE affecting Apache web servers running Tomcat\n\nSID: [44531](https://snort.org/rule_docs/1-44531)\n\nCVE-2018-0296: Directory traversal to gain unauthorized access to Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances\n(ASAs) and Firewalls\n\nSID: 46897\n\nCVE-2018-7600: RCE for Website built with Drupal aka \"Drupalgeddon\"\n\nSID: [46316](https://snort.org/rule_docs/1-46316)\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\nThe threat actors utilized leased IP addresses from organizations that offer virtual private server (VPS)\nservices.
