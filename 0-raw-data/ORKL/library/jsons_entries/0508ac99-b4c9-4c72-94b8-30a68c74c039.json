    "plain_text": "# The Colonial pipeline ransomware hackers had a secret weapon: self-promoting cybersecurity firms\n\n**[technologyreview.com/2021/05/24/1025195/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-bitdefender/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/24/1025195/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-bitdefender/)**\n\nRenee Dudley\n\nOn January 11, antivirus company Bitdefender said it was “happy to announce” a startling\nbreakthrough. It had found a flaw in the ransomware that a gang known as DarkSide was\nusing to freeze computer networks of dozens of businesses in the US and Europe.\nCompanies facing demands from DarkSide could download a free tool from Bitdefender and\navoid paying millions of dollars in ransom to the hackers.\n\nBut [Bitdefender wasn’t the first to identify this flaw. Two other researchers, Fabian Wosar](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2021/01/darkside-ransomware-decryption-tool/)\n[and Michael Gillespie, had noticed it the month before and had begun discreetly looking for](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-ransomware-superhero-of-normal-illinois)\nvictims to help. By publicizing its tool, Bitdefender alerted DarkSide to the lapse, which\ninvolved reusing the same digital keys to lock and unlock multiple victims. The next day,\nDarkSide declared that it had repaired the problem, and that “new companies have nothing\nto hope for.”\n\n“Special thanks to BitDefender for helping fix our issues,” DarkSide said. “This will make us\neven better.”\n\nDarkSide soon proved it wasn’t bluffing, unleashing a string of attacks. This month, it\n[paralyzed the Colonial Pipeline Co., prompting a shutdown of the 5,500-mile pipeline that](https://www.colpipe.com/news/press-releases/media-statement-colonial-pipeline-system-disruption)\ncarries 45% of the fuel used on the East Coast—quickly followed by a rise in gasoline prices,\n\n\n-----\n\npanic buying of gas across the Southeast, and closures of thousands of gas stations. Absent\nBitdefender’s announcement, it’s possible that the crisis might have been contained, and that\nColonial might have quietly restored its system with Wosar and Gillespie’s decryption tool.\n\nInstead, Colonial paid DarkSide $4.4 million in Bitcoin for a key to unlock its files. “I will admit\nthat I wasn’t comfortable seeing money go out the door to people like this,” CEO Joseph\nBlount told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe missed opportunity was part of a broader pattern of botched or half-hearted responses\nto the growing menace of ransomware, which during the pandemic has disabled businesses,\nschools, hospitals, and government agencies across the country. The incident also shows\nhow antivirus companies eager to make a name for themselves sometimes violate one of the\ncardinal rules of the cat-and-mouse game of cyberwarfare: Don’t let your opponents know\nwhat you’ve figured out. During World War II, when the British secret service learned from\ndecrypted communications that the Gestapo was planning to abduct and murder a valuable\ndouble agent, Johnny Jebsen, his handler wasn’t allowed to warn him for fear of cluing in the\nenemy that its cipher had been cracked. Today, ransomware hunters like Wosar and\nGillespie try to prolong the attackers’ ignorance, even at the cost of contacting fewer victims.\nSooner or later, as payments drop off, the cybercriminals realize that something has gone\nwrong.\n\nWhether to tout a decryption tool is a “calculated decision,” said Rob McLeod, senior director\nof the threat response unit for cybersecurity firm eSentire. From the marketing perspective,\n“You are singing that song from the rooftops about how you have come up with a security\nsolution that will decrypt a victim’s data. And then the security researcher angle says, ‘Don’t\ndisclose any information here. Keep the ransomware bugs that we’ve found that allow us to\ndecode the data secret, so as not to notify the threat actors.’”\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a post on the dark web, DarkSide thanked Bitdefender for identifying a flaw in the gang’s\nransomware. (Highlight added by ProPublica.)\nWosar said that publicly releasing tools, as Bitdefender did, has become riskier as ransoms\nhave soared and the gangs have grown wealthier and more technically adept. In the early\ndays of ransomware, when hackers froze home computers for a few hundred dollars, they\noften couldn’t determine how their code was broken unless the flaw was specifically pointed\nout to them.\n\nToday, the creators of ransomware “have access to reverse engineers and penetration\ntesters who are very very capable,” he said. “That’s how they gain entrance to these\noftentimes highly secured networks in the first place. They download the decryptor, they\ndisassemble it, they reverse-engineer it, and they figure out exactly why we were able to\ndecrypt their files. And 24 hours later, the whole thing is fixed. Bitdefender should have\nknown better.”\n\n## Related Story\n\n\n-----\n\n[Could the ransomware crisis force action against Russia?](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/21/1025159/colonial-pipeline-russia-usa-hackers/)\n\nMoscow’s blind eye toward cybercriminals has made escalating attacks inevitable, say\nexperts. But changing the approach is easier said than done.\n\nIt wasn’t the first time Bitdefender trumpeted a solution that Wosar or Gillespie had beaten it\nto. Gillespie had broken the code of a ransomware strain called GoGoogle, and was helping\n[victims without any fanfare, when Bitdefender released a decryption tool in May 2020. Other](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2020/05/gogoogle-decryption-tool/)\ncompanies have also announced breakthroughs publicly, Wosar and Gillespie said.\n\n“People are desperate for a news mention, and big security companies don’t care about\nvictims,” Wosar said.\n\nBogdan Botezatu, director of threat research at Bucharest, Romania–based Bitdefender, said\nthe company wasn’t aware of the earlier success in unlocking files infected by DarkSide.\n\nRegardless, he said, Bitdefender decided to publish its tool “because most victims who fall\nfor ransomware do not have the right connection with ransomware support groups and won’t\nknow where to ask for help unless they can learn about the existence of tools from media\nreports or with a simple search.”\n\nBitdefender has provided free technical support to more than a dozen DarkSide victims, and\n“we believe many others have successfully used the tool without our intervention,” Botezatu\nsaid. Over the years, Bitdefender has helped individuals and businesses avoid paying more\nthan $100 million in ransom, he said.\n\nBitdefender recognized that DarkSide might correct the flaw, Botezatu said: “We are well\naware that attackers are agile and adapt to our decryptors.” But DarkSide might have\n“spotted the issue” anyway “We don’t believe in ransomware decryptors made silently\n\n\n-----\n\navailable. Attackers will learn about their existence by impersonating home users or\ncompanies in need, while the vast majority of victims will have no idea that they can get their\ndata back for free.”\n\n**The attack on Colonial Pipeline, and the ensuing chaos at the gas pumps throughout the**\nSoutheast, appears to have spurred the federal government to be more vigilant. President\nJoe Biden issued an executive order to improve cybersecurity and create a blueprint for a\nfederal response to cyberattacks. DarkSide said it was shutting down under US pressure,\nalthough ransomware crews have often disbanded to avoid scrutiny and then re-formed\nunder new names, or their members have launched or joined other groups.\n\n“As sophisticated as they are, these guys will pop up again, and they’ll be that much\nsmarter,” said Aaron Tantleff, a Chicago cybersecurity attorney who has consulted with 10\ncompanies attacked by DarkSide. “They’ll come back with a vengeance.”\n\n\"People are desperate for a news mention, and big security companies don’t care\nabout victims.\"\n\n_Fabian Wosar, Ransomware Hunting Team_\n\nAt least until now, private researchers and companies have often been more effective than\nthe government in fighting ransomware. Last October, Microsoft disrupted the infrastructure\nof Trickbot, a network of more than 1 million infected computers that disseminated the\nnotorious Ryuk strain of ransomware, by disabling its servers and communications. That\nmonth, ProtonMail, the Swiss-based email service, shut down 20,000 Ryuk-related accounts.\n\nWosar and Gillespie, who belong to a worldwide volunteer group called the Ransomware\nHunting Team, have cracked more than 300 major ransomware strains and variants, saving\nan estimated 4 million victims from paying billions of dollars.\n\nBy contrast, the FBI rarely decrypts ransomware or arrests the attackers, who are typically\nbased in countries like Russia or Iran that lack extradition agreements with the US.\nDarkSide, for instance, is believed to operate out of Russia. Far more victims seek help from\nthe Hunting Team, through websites maintained by its members, than from the FBI.\n\nThe US Secret Service also investigates ransomware, which falls under its purview of\ncombating financial crimes. But, especially in election years, it sometimes rotates agents off\ncyber assignments to carry out its better-known mission of protecting presidents, vice\npresidents, major-party candidates, and their families. European law enforcement, especially\nthe Dutch National Police, has been more successful than the US in arresting attackers and\nseizing servers.\n\n## Related Story\n\n\n-----\n\n[A wave of ransomware hits US hospitals as coronavirus spikes](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/29/1011436/a-wave-of-ransomware-hits-us-hospitals-as-coronavirus-spikes/)\n\nAn unprecedented and opportunistic attack raises a disturbing question: Will it cost a life?\n\nSimilarly, the US government has made only modest headway in pushing private industry,\nincluding pipeline companies, to strengthen cybersecurity defenses. Cybersecurity oversight\nis divided among an alphabet soup of agencies, hampering coordination. The Department of\nHomeland Security conducts “vulnerability assessments” for critical infrastructure, which\nincludes pipelines.\n\nIt reviewed Colonial Pipeline in around 2013 as part of a study of places where a cyberattack\nmight cause a catastrophe. The pipeline was deemed resilient, meaning that it could recover\nquickly, according to a former DHS official. The department did not respond to questions\nabout any subsequent reviews.\n\n[Five years later, DHS created a pipeline cybersecurity initiative to identify weaknesses in](https://www.cisa.gov/pipeline-cybersecurity-initiative)\npipeline computer systems and recommend strategies to address them. Participation is\nvoluntary, and a person familiar with the initiative said that it is more useful for smaller\ncompanies with limited in-house IT expertise than for big ones like Colonial. The National\nRisk Management Center, which oversees the initiative, also grapples with other\nthorny [issues such as election security.](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fact_sheet_nrmc_508_1.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ransomware has skyrocketed since 2012, when the advent of Bitcoin made it hard to**\ntrack or block payments. The criminals’ tactics have evolved from indiscriminate “spray and\npray” campaigns seeking a few hundred dollars apiece to targeting specific businesses,\ngovernment agencies and nonprofit groups with multimillion-dollar demands.\n\nAttacks on energy businesses in particular have increased during the pandemic—not just in\nthe US but in Canada, Latin America, and Europe. As the companies allowed employees to\nwork from home, they relaxed some security controls, McLeod said.\n\nDarkSide adopted what is known as a “ransomware-as-a-service” model. Under this\nmodel, it partnered with affiliates who launched the attacks. The affiliates received 75%\nto 90% of the ransom, with DarkSide keeping the remainder.\n\nSince 2019, numerous gangs have ratcheted up pressure with a technique known as “double\nextortion.” Upon entering a system, they steal sensitive data before launching ransomware\nthat encodes the files and makes it impossible for hospitals, universities, and cities to do their\ndaily work. If the loss of computer access is not sufficiently intimidating, they threaten to\nreveal confidential information, often posting samples as leverage. For instance, when the\nWashington, DC, police department didn’t pay the $4 million ransom demanded by a gang\ncalled Babuk last month, Babuk published intelligence briefings, names of criminal suspects\nand witnesses, and personnel files, from medical information to polygraph test results, of\nofficers and job candidates.\n\nDarkSide, which emerged last August, epitomized this new breed. It chose targets based on\na careful financial analysis or information gleaned from corporate emails. For instance, it\nattacked one of Tantleff’s clients during a week when the hackers knew the company would\nbe vulnerable because it was transitioning its files to the cloud and didn’t have clean\nbackups.\n\nTo infiltrate target networks, the gang used advanced methods such as “zero-day exploits”\nthat immediately take advantage of software vulnerabilities before they can be patched.\nOnce inside, it moved swiftly, looking not only for sensitive data but also for the victim’s cyber\ninsurance policy, so it could peg its demands to the amount of coverage. After two to three\ndays of poking around, DarkSide encrypted the files.\n\n“They have a faster attack window,” said Christopher Ballod, associate managing director for\ncyber risk at Kroll, the business investigations firm, who has advised half a dozen DarkSide\nvictims. “The longer you dwell in the system, the more likely you are to be caught.”\n\nTypically, DarkSide’s demands were “on the high end of the scale,” $5 million and up, Ballod\nsaid. One scary tactic: if publicly traded companies didn’t pay the ransom, DarkSide\nthreatened to share information stolen from them with short-sellers who would profit if the\nshare price dropped upon publication.\n\n\n-----\n\nDarkSide s site on the dark web identified dozens of victims and described the confidential\ndata it claimed to have filched from them. One was New Orleans law firm Stone Pigman\nWalther Wittmann. “A big annoyance is what it was,” attorney Phil Wittmann said, referring to\nthe DarkSide attack in February. “We paid them nothing,” said Michael Walshe Jr., chair of\nthe firm’s management committee, declining to comment further.\n\n[Last November, DarkSide adopted what is known as a “ransomware-as-a-service” model.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/05/shining-a-light-on-darkside-ransomware-operations.html)\nUnder this model, it partnered with affiliates who launched the attacks. The\naffiliates [received 75% to 90% of the ransom, with DarkSide keeping the remainder. As this](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-is-creating-a-secure-data-leak-service-in-iran/)\npartnership suggests, the ransomware ecosystem is a distorted mirror of corporate culture,\nwith everything from job interviews to procedures for handling disputes. After DarkSide shut\ndown, several people who identified themselves as its affiliates complained on a dispute\nresolution forum that it had stiffed them. “The target paid, but I did not receive my share,” one\nwrote.\n\nTogether, DarkSide and its affiliates reportedly grossed at least $90 million. Seven of\nTantleff’s clients, including two companies in the energy industry, paid ransoms ranging from\n$1.25 million to $6 million, reflecting negotiated discounts from initial demands of $7.5 million\nto $30 million. His other three clients hit by DarkSide did not pay. In one of those cases, the\nhackers demanded $50 million. Negotiations grew acrimonious, and the two sides couldn’t\nagree on a price.\n\nDarkSide’s representatives were shrewd bargainers, Tantleff said. If a victim said it couldn’t\nafford the ransom because of the pandemic, DarkSide was ready with data showing that the\ncompany’s revenue was up, or that covid-19’s impact was factored into the price.\n\nDarkSide’s grasp of geopolitics was less advanced than its approach to ransomware. Around\nthe same time that it adopted the affiliate model, it posted that it was planning to safeguard\ninformation stolen from victims by storing it in servers in Iran. DarkSide apparently didn’t\nrealize that an Iranian connection would complicate its collection of ransoms from victims in\nthe US, which has economic sanctions restricting financial transactions with Iran. Although\nDarkSide later walked back this statement, saying that it had only considered Iran as a\npossible location, numerous cyber insurers had concerns about covering payments to the\ngroup. Coveware, a Connecticut firm that negotiates with attackers on behalf of victims,\nstopped dealing with DarkSide.\n\nBallod said that with their insurers unwilling to reimburse the ransom, none of his clients paid\nDarkSide, despite concerns about exposure of their data. Even if they had caved in to\nDarkSide, and received assurances from the hackers in return that the data would be\nshredded, the information might still leak, he said.\n\n\n-----\n\n**During DarkSide s changeover to the affiliate model, a flaw was introduced into its**\nransomware. The vulnerability caught the attention of members of the Ransomware Hunting\nTeam. Established in 2016, the invitation-only team consists of about a dozen volunteers in\nthe US, Spain, Italy, Germany, Hungary, and the UK. They work in cybersecurity or related\nfields. In their spare time, they collaborate in finding and decrypting new ransomware strains.\n\nSeveral members, including Wosar, have little formal education but an aptitude for coding. A\nhigh school dropout, Wosar grew up in a working-class family near the German port city of\nRostock. In 1992, at the age of eight, he saw a computer for the first time and was\nentranced. By 16, he was developing his own antivirus software and making money from it.\nNow 37, he has worked for antivirus firm Emsisoft since its inception almost two decades\nago and is its chief technology officer. He moved to the UK from Germany in 2018 and lives\nnear London.\n\nHe has been battling ransomware hackers since 2012, when he cracked a strain called\nACCDFISA, which stood for “Anti Cyber Crime Department of Federal Internet Security\nAgency.” This fictional agency was notifying people that child pornography had infected their\ncomputers, and so it was blocking access to their files unless they paid $100 to remove the\nvirus.\n\n## Related Story\n\n\n-----\n\n[Google says it s too easy for hackers to find new security flaws](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/03/1017242/google-project-zero-day-flaw-security/)\n\nAttackers are exploiting the same types of software vulnerabilities over and over again,\nbecause companies often miss the forest for the trees.\n\nThe ACCDFISA hacker eventually noticed that the strain had been decrypted and released a\nrevised version. Many of Wosar’s subsequent triumphs were also fleeting. He and his\nteammates tried to keep criminals blissfully unaware for as long as possible that their strain\nwas vulnerable. They left cryptic messages on forums inviting victims to contact them for\nassistance or sent direct messages to people who posted that they had been attacked.\n\nIn the course of protecting against computer intrusions, analysts at antivirus firms sometimes\ndetected ransomware flaws and built decryption tools, though it wasn’t their main focus.\nSometimes they collided with Wosar.\n\nIn 2014, Wosar discovered that a ransomware strain called CryptoDefense copied and\npasted from Microsoft Windows some of the code it used to lock and unlock files, not\nrealizing that the same code was preserved in a folder on the victim’s own computer. It was\nmissing the signal, or “flag,” in their program, usually included by ransomware creators to\ninstruct Windows not to save a copy of the key.\n\nWosar quickly developed a decryption tool to retrieve the key. “We faced an interesting\nconundrum,” Sarah White, another Hunting Team member, wrote on Emsisoft’s [blog. “How to](https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/6032/cryptodefense-the-story-of-insecure-ransomware-keys-and-self-serving-bloggers/)\nget our tool out to the most victims possible without alerting the malware developer of his\nmistake?”\n\nWosar discreetly sought out CryptoDefense victims through support forums, volunteer\nnetworks, and announcements of where to contact for help. He avoided describing how the\ntool worked or the blunder it exploited. When victims came forward, he supplied the fix,\nscrubbing the ransomware from at least 350 computers. CryptoDefense eventually “caught\non to us ... but he still did not have access to the decrypter we used and had no idea how we\nwere unlocking his victims’ files,” White wrote.\n\n\"We faced an interesting conundrum… How to get our tool out to the most victims\npossible without alerting the malware developer of his mistake?”\n\n_Sarah White, Ransomware Hunting Team_\n\nBut then an antivirus company, Symantec, uncovered the same problem and bragged about\nthe discovery on a blog post that “contained enough information to help the CryptoDefense\ndeveloper find and correct the flaw,” White wrote. Within 24 hours the attackers began\n[spreading a revised version. They changed its name to CryptoWall and made $325 million.](https://www.coindesk.com/cryptowall-325-million-bitcoin-ransom)\n\nSymantec “chose quick publicity over helping CryptoDefense victims recover their files,”\nWhite wrote. “Sometimes there are things that are better left unsaid.”\n\n\n-----\n\nA spokeswoman for Broadcom, which acquired Symantec s enterprise security business in\n2019, declined to comment, saying that “the team members who worked on the tool are no\nlonger with the company.”\n\n**Like Wosar, the 29-year-old** **[Gillespie comes from poverty and never went to college.](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-ransomware-superhero-of-normal-illinois)**\nWhen he was growing up in central Illinois, his family struggled so much financially that they\nsometimes had to move in with friends or relatives. After high school, he worked full time for\n10 years at a computer repair chain called Nerds on Call. Last year, he became a malware\nand cybersecurity researcher at Coveware.\n\nLast December, he messaged Wosar for help. Gillespie had been working with a DarkSide\nvictim who had paid a ransom and received a tool to recover the data. But DarkSide’s\ndecryptor had a reputation for being slow, and the victim hoped that Gillespie could speed up\nthe process.\n\nGillespie analyzed the software, which contained a key to release the files. He wanted to\nextract the key, but because it was stored in an unusually complex way, he couldn’t. He\nturned to Wosar, who was able to isolate it.\n\nThe teammates then began testing the key on other files infected by DarkSide. Gillespie\nchecked files uploaded by victims to the website he operates, ID Ransomware, while Wosar\nused VirusTotal, an online database of suspected malware.\n\nThat night, they shared a discovery.\n\n“I have confirmation DarkSide is re-using their RSA keys,” Gillespie wrote to the Hunting\nTeam on its Slack channel. A type of cryptography, RSA generates two keys: a public key to\nencode data and a private key to decipher it. RSA is used legitimately to safeguard many\naspects of e-commerce, such as protecting credit numbers. But it’s also been co-opted by\nransomware hackers.\n\n“I noticed the same as I was able to decrypt newly encrypted files using their decrypter,”\nWosar replied less than an hour later, at 2:45 a.m. London time.\n\nTheir analysis showed that before adopting the affiliate model, DarkSide had used a different\npublic and private key for each victim. Wosar suspected that during this transition, DarkSide\nintroduced a mistake into its affiliate portal used to generate the ransomware for each target.\nWosar and Gillespie could now use the key that Wosar had extracted to retrieve files from\nWindows machines seized by DarkSide. The cryptographic blunder didn’t affect Linux\noperating systems.\n\n## Related Story\n\n\n-----\n\n[How officials are protecting the election from ransomware hackers](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/15/1010551/election-ransomware-disinformation/)\n\nConcerns about an attack on election systems are real. But a hack wouldn't damage the vote\nas much as the disinformation that would result.\n\n“We were scratching our heads,” Wosar said. “Could they really have fucked up this badly?\nDarkSide was one of the more professional ransomware-as-a-service schemes out there.\nFor them to make such a huge mistake is very, very rare.”\n\nThe Hunting Team celebrated quietly, without seeking publicity. White, who is a computer\nscience student at Royal Holloway, part of the University of London, began looking for\nDarkSide victims. She contacted firms that handle digital forensics and incident response.\n\n“We told them, ‘Hey, listen, if you have any DarkSide victims, tell them to reach out to us; we\ncan help them. We can recover their files and they don’t have to pay a huge ransom,’” Wosar\nsaid.\n\nThe DarkSide hackers mostly took the Christmas season off. Gillespie and Wosar expected\nthat when the attacks resumed in the new year, their discovery would help dozens of victims.\nBut then Bitdefender published its post, under the headline “Darkside Ransomware\nDecryption Tool.”\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a messaging channel with the ransomware response community, someone asked why\nBitdefender would tip off the hackers. “Publicity,” White responded. “Looks good. I can\nguarantee they’ll fix it much faster now though.”\n\nShe was right. The next day, DarkSide acknowledged the error that Wosar and Gillespie had\nfound before Bitdefender. “Due to the problem with key generation, some companies have\nthe same keys,” the hackers wrote, adding that up to 40% of keys were affected.\n\nDarkSide mocked Bitdefender for releasing the decryptor at “the wrong time ... as the activity\nof us and our partners during the New Year holidays is the lowest.”\n\nAdding to the team’s frustrations, Wosar discovered that the Bitdefender tool had its own\ndrawbacks. Using the company’s decryptor, he tried to unlock samples infected by DarkSide\nand found that they were damaged in the process. “They actually implemented the\ndecryption wrong,” Wosar said. “That means if victims did use the Bitdefender tool, there’s a\ngood chance that they damaged the data.”\n\nAsked about Wosar’s criticism, Botezatu said that data recovery is difficult, and that\nBitdefender has “taken all precautions to make sure that we’re not compromising user data,”\nincluding exhaustive testing and “code that evaluates whether the resulting decrypted file is\nvalid.”\n\nEven without Bitdefender, DarkSide might have soon realized its mistake anyway, Wosar and\nGillespie said. For example, as they sifted through compromised networks, the hackers\nmight have come across emails in which victims helped by the Hunting Team discussed the\nflaw.\n\n“They might figure it out that way—that is always a possibility,” Wosar said. “But it’s\nespecially painful if a vulnerability is being burned through something stupid like this.”\n\nThe incident led the Hunting Team to coin a term for the premature exposure of a weakness\nin a ransomware strain. “Internally, we often joke, ‘Yeah, they are probably going to pull a\nBitdefender,’” Wosar said.\n\n_This story was co-published with ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses_\n_of power._ _Renee Dudley and Daniel Golden have focused on ransomware for ProPublica and_\n_are working on a book about the Ransomware Hunting Team, to be published next year by_\n_Farrar, Straus and Giroux._\n\n_[Sign up to receive ProPublica's biggest stories as soon as they’re published.](https://www.propublica.org/newsletters/the-big-story?source=www.propublica.org&placement=top-note&region=national)_\n\n\n-----",
