The**\n\n**exploit uses PostScript and can evade Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data**\n\n**Execution Prevention (DEP) protection methods.**\n\n**The exploit was discovered in the wild in August 2015, when it was used in a** **targeted attack by the**\n\n**Platinum group, presumably against targets in India. Over the following months, there was significant**\n\n**growth in the number of threat actors using the vulnerability as a primary tool for initial penetration, with**\n\n**both the attack groups and their targets located in South-East and Central Asia and the Far East.**\n\n**In this research paper, we discuss examples of attacks using the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability**\n\n**undertaken by some of these groups.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The group is believe to originate from South-East Asia. Its attacks can be traced as far back as 2009.**\n\n**The group is notable for exploiting 0-day vulnerabilities and carrying out a small number of highly**\n\n**focused targeted attacks – mostly against government agencies in Malaysia, Indonesia, China and**\n\n**India.**\n\n**This group was the first to exploit the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability. After the vulnerability was corrected**\n\n**with Microsoft updates in September and November 2015, no new Platinum attacks exploiting this**\n\n**vulnerability have been detected.**\n\n**Microsoft presented the activity of this group at the SAS conference in February 2016, and in its paper:**\n\n**[PLATINUM: Targeted attacks in South and Southeast Asia](http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/2/5/225BFE3E-E1DE-4F5B-A77B-71200928D209/Platinum feature article - Targeted attacks in South and Southeast Asia April 2016.pdf)** **.**\n\n**The group has been known for several years and is believed to be of Chinese origin. In November and**\n\n**December 2015, it used a modified exploit for CVE-2015-2545 in attacks against information and news**\n\n**agencies in Taiwan. These attacks were described in a FireEye research paper – The EPS Awakens –**\n\n**Part 2.**\n\n**In December 2015, Kaspersky Lab became aware of a targeted attack against the Japanese defense**\n\n**sector. In order to infect victims, the attacker sent an email with an attached DOCX file exploiting the**\n\n**CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability in Microsoft Office using an embedded EPS (Encapsulated Postscript)**\n\n**object. The EPS object contained a shellcode that dropped and loaded a 32-bit or 64-bit DLL file**\n\n**depending on the system architecture. This, in turn exploited another vulnerability to elevate privileges**\n\n**to Local System (CVE-2015-1701) and download additional malware components from the C&C server.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**of the server activity for a period of several months did not result in any new findings. We believe the**\n\n**attackers either lost access to the server or realized that it resulted in too much attention from security**\n\n**researchers, as the attack was widely discussed by the Japanese security community.**\n\n**According to our research partner in Japan, the original EvilPost attack in December 2015 arrived as a**\n\n**spear-phishing email with a Word document attached.**\n\n**This document embedded an EPS object file, which triggered a vulnerability in the EPS format handler**\n\n**in Microsoft Word. Even with an exploit component, Microsoft Word rendered the document correctly**\n\n**and displayed the decoy message. The document is written in good Japanese, as shown below.**\n\n**It has been used to decoy New Year impressions of defense-related organizations.**\n\n**[This attack was also described in the FireEye report, mentioned above.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/12/the-eps-awakens-part-two.html)**\n\n**An overview of the activity of the EvilPost group activity was provided to subscribers of the** **Kaspersky**\n\n**Lab Threat Intelligence Service in March 2016. For information about the service, please write to**\n\n**[intelreports@kaspersky.com.](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)**\n\n**In March and April 2016, a series of emails laced with an exploit forCVE-2015-2545 were detected. The**\n\n**emails were sent in spear-phishing attacks, presumably targeting organizations in Hong Kong.**\n\n**Identifying a specific group behind these attacks is difficult because they used a new variant of a widely**\n\n**available backdoor known as PoisonIvy (from which the name of the group, SPIVY, is derived). A**\n\n**[description of these incidents can be found in the PaloAlto blog.](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/04/unit42-new-poison-ivy-rat-variant-targets-hong-kong-pro-democracy-activists/)**\n\n**These two groups have not yet been publicly described.

According to our telemetry, Danti has also**\n\n**been actively hitting targets in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Myanmar, Nepal and the**\n\n**Philippines.**\n\n**The group implemented a new campaign in February and March 2016, using a repurposed**\n\n**implementation of the CVE-2015-2545 exploit with custom shellcode. In order to infect the victim, the**\n\n**attackers distributed spear-phishing emails with an attached DOCX file exploiting the CVE-2015-2545**\n\n**vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The exploit is based on a malformed embedded EPS (Encapsulated**\n\n**Postscript) object. This contains the shellcode that drops a backdoor, providing full access to the**\n\n**attackers.**\n\n**Main findings:**\n\n**Danti, a previously unknown group, is probably related to NetTraveller and DragonOK**\n\n**In February-March 2016 the group was observed using CVE-2015-2545**\n\n**It remains active, conducting attacks against Indian diplomatic organizations**\n\n**Related attacks have been observed against Central and South East Asia targets**\n\n**The campaign leveraging the exploit for CVE-2015-2545 took place in February 2016.

According to Crowdstrike, the same marker**\n\n**has been used previously by a number of APT groups (Anchor Panda, Samurai Panda and Temper**\n\n**Panda).**\n\n**The latest known activity of “admin@338” was in August 2015, when it was used to target Hong Kong-**\n\n**based media using its own tools, LOWBALL and BUBBLEWRAP.**\n\n**However, we are unable to draw any conclusion regarding the relationship between the SVCMONDR**\n\n**group and Temper Panda.**\n\n**According to KSN data, in addition to Taiwan, there are some SVCMONDR victims in Thailand.**\n\n**We are currently aware of at least four different APT actors actively using exploits of the CVE-2015-**\n\n**2545 vulnerability: TwoForOne (also known as Platinum), EvilPost, APT16 and Danti.**\n\n**These groups have their own toolsets of malicious program. Danti’s arsenal is more extensive than**\n\n**those of EvilPost and APT16, and in terms of functionality can be compared with Platinum.

It may already have full access to internal networks in**\n\n**Indian government structures. According to Kaspersky Security Network, some Danti Trojans have also**\n\n**been detected in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Myanmar, Nepal and the Philippines.**\n\n**Despite the fact that Danti uses a 1-day exploit, the group is able to make its own modifications to**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The use of CVE-2015-2545 exploits is on the rise. In addition to the groups mentioned above, we have**\n\n**seen numerous examples of these exploits being used by traditional cybercriminals in mass mailings in**\n\n**February-April 2016. Such attacks mostly target financial institutions in Asia. Specifically, attacks have**\n\n**been recorded in Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia. There are reasons to believe that Nigerian**\n\n**cybercriminals are behind these attacks.
