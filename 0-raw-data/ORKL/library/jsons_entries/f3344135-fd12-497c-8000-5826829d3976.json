REUTERS/Raphael Satter\n\n\n-----\n\nWHO Chief Information Security Officer Flavio Aggio said the identity of the hackers was\nunclear and the effort was unsuccessful. But he warned that hacking attempts against the\nagency and its partners have soared as they battle to contain the coronavirus, which has\nkilled more than 15,000 worldwide.\n\nThe attempted break-in at the WHO was first flagged to Reuters by Alexander Urbelis, a\ncybersecurity expert and attorney with the New York-based Blackstone Law Group, which\ntracks suspicious internet domain registration activity.\n\nUrbelis said he picked up on the activity around March 13, when a group of hackers he’d\nbeen following activated a malicious site mimicking the WHO’s internal email system.\n\n“I realized quite quickly that this was a live attack on the World Health Organization in the\nmidst of a pandemic,” he said.\n\nUrbelis said he didn’t know who was responsible, but two other sources briefed on the matter\nsaid they suspected an advanced group of hackers known as DarkHotel, which has been\nconducting cyber-espionage operations since at least 2007.\n\nMessages sent to email addresses maintained by the hackers went unreturned.\n\nWhen asked by Reuters about the incident, the WHO’s Aggio confirmed that the site spotted\nby Urbelis had been used in an attempt to steal passwords from multiple agency staffers.\n\n“There has been a big increase in targeting of the WHO and other cybersecurity incidents,”\nAggio said in a telephone interview. “There are no hard numbers, but such compromise\nattempts against us and the use of (WHO) impersonations to target others have more than\ndoubled.”\n\n[The WHO published an alert last month - available here here - warning that hackers are](https://www.who.int/about/communications/cyber-security)\nposing as the agency to steal money and sensitive information from the public.\n\nAnd government officials in the United States, Britain and elsewhere have issued\ncybersecurity warnings about the dangers of a newly remote workforce as people disperse to\ntheir homes to work and study because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe motives in the case identified by Reuters aren’t clear. United Nations agencies, the\nWHO among them, are regularly targeted by digital espionage campaigns and Aggio said he\ndid not know who precisely at the organization the hackers had in their sights.\n\nCybersecurity firms including Romania’s Bitdefender and Moscow-based Kaspersky said\nthey have traced many of DarkHotel’s operations to East Asia - an area that has been\nparticularly affected by the coronavirus. Specific targets have included government\nemployees and business executives in places such as China, North Korea, Japan, and the\nUnited States.\n\n\n-----\n\nCostin Raiu, head of global research and analysis at Kaspersky, could not confirm that\nDarkHotel was responsible for the WHO attack but said the same malicious web\ninfrastructure had also been used to target other healthcare and humanitarian organizations\nin recent weeks.\n\n“At times like this, any information about cures or tests or vaccines relating to coronavirus\nwould be priceless and the priority of any intelligence organization of an affected country,” he\nsaid.\n\nOfficials and cybersecurity experts have warned that hackers of all stripes are seeking to\ncapitalize on international concern over the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nUrbelis said he has tracked thousands of coronavirus-themed web sites being set up daily,\nmany of them obviously malicious.\n\n“It’s still around 2,000 a day,” he said. “I have never seen anything like this.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Hyonhee Shin in Seoul; Editing by Chris Sanders and Edward Tobin\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\nfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-up\n\n\n-----",
