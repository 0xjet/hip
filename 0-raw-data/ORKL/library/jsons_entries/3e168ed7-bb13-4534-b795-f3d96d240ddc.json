    "plain_text": "# What even is Winnti?\n\n**risky.biz/whatiswinnti/**\n\nOp-Ed: It's time we had one last talk about Winnti...\n\nBy Daniel Gordon · July 20, 2020\n\nThanks\nlargely to\n\nThis post sponsored by The Hewlett Foundation.\n\ninconsistent methodologies, poor clustering, and lack of collaboration, the word ‘Winnti’ has\ngradually been rendered meaningless.\n\nWe first heard the word ‘Winnti’ used to describe some specific attributes or actions: a\nmalware family, stolen code signing certificates, rootkits, malware associated with suspected\nChinese hacking, links to some specific Chinese personas (using hacker handles that spoke\nChinese and claimed to live in China), and some specific targeting.\n\nSeven years and a dozen studies later, we ended up with a name linked to at least 15 other\nnames, some of which are likely to be separate groups. We’re at the point where Winnti\ndoesn’t clearly represent any particular targeting, tools or techniques and also may not\nrepresent a group of people anymore.\n\nIt’s worth exploring how we got to this point to avoid repeating the same mistakes.\n\n## Origins\n\n[Winnti was named as a group in a 2013 blog by Kaspersky. The blog’s authors named the](https://securelist.com/winnti-more-than-just-a-game/37029/)\ngroup based on a malware family previously named by Symantec. This very quickly brings\nus to lesson one: it’s not advisable to name a group exclusively based on the malware family,\nespecially when the name was coined by another researcher.\n\nKaspersky’s research described intrusions going back to 2010, in which attackers targeted\nvideo game companies or used digital code signing certificates stolen from game companies.\n\n\n-----\n\nKaspersky listed some other notable characteristics in the campaigns it analysed, including\nunusual infrastructure DNS configurations, some relatively advanced rootkit malware,\n[specific C2 choices and the use of characteristic Chinese malware such as PlugX.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.plugx)\n\nKaspersky discovered activity that generated revenue via creation of in-game currency or\ntheft of source code, as well as targeting of specific ethnic groups that pointed to PRC\nsponsorship. Kaspersky researchers also picked up on some terrible OPSEC that revealed\nChinese personas, further substantiated when some of the same handles showed up in a\n[2018 US Department of Justice indictment that pinned the theft of aerospace IP on the](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1106491/download)\nJiangsu Province Ministry of State Security.\n\nA year later [FireEye published a report about how Chinese groups appeared to be sharing](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-malware-supply-chain.pdf)\nmalware development, digital code signing certificates, and infrastructure. The company\nreferenced some of the stolen digital certificates from Kaspersky’s prior research but didn’t at\nthis stage name Winnti as a group.\n\nBy mid-2015, [Kaspersky linked Winnti malware to other research on the Axiom Group (which](https://securelist.com/games-are-over/70991/)\nmay or may not be the same group). Axiom had been tied to a lot of intrusions, but most\n[critically, its fingerprints were identified in the CCleaner, Netsarang, and](https://www.intezer.com/blog/research/evidence-aurora-operation-still-active-part-2-more-ties-uncovered-between-ccleaner-hack-chinese-hackers/) [ASUS software](https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/)\nsupply chain attacks. Kaspersky used similarities between malware used in these attacks\nand those previously attributed to ‘Winnti’ to illustrate that the latter was targeting a broader\nset of organisations than gaming companies. While these findings were important, attribution\nbased on malware similarity alone is risky, especially when there is an existing body of\nresearch about malware being shared among different groups.\n\n[In 2016, Symantec published a blog about digital signing certificate abuse that is pertinent to](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=62e325ae-f551-4855-b9cf-28a7d52d1534&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\nthe Winnti story. It referenced Kaspersky’s earlier findings but didn’t name it, describing it\nonly as “a third party vendor”. Here’s another lesson: in any other field of research you would\ncredit primary sources, even if you don’t especially like them. It puts recognition where it’s\ndue, fosters collaboration and reduces the risk of “semantic drift” – where over time the\ndefinition of something loses connection to its original meaning.\n\nTo their credit, Symantec researchers tried to correct the course a little on their previous work\n\n- using the blog post to differentiate a group it referred to as Blackfly from the malware family\nWinnti. Unfortunately, Symantec’s more cautious approach to naming conventions never\ncaught on elsewhere.\n\nNot content to let a chance pass by to participate in the Winnti goat rodeo, Cylance posted a\nblog in 2016 about PassCV activity (“PassCV” is a name coined by Blue Coat) and linked\nthis activity to Winnti based on stolen code signing certificates. The post is light on malware\nanalysis but mentions the use of several remote access trojans, ZXShell and Gh0st, in\npassing. Gh0st RAT has been used by multiple Chinese and North Korean groups. ZXShell\n\n\n-----\n\n[was a RAT commonly associated with Group72, which on the one hand also seems to](https://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/opening-zxshell)\ncorrespond to Axiom/Winnti activity, but on the other, appears tied to APT27/Emissary\nPanda.\n\n[With the benefit of time on its side, Microsoft came up with the most sane approach,](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/01/25/detecting-threat-actors-in-recent-german-industrial-attacks-with-windows-defender-atp/)\nbreaking down the groups using Winnti malware into BARIUM and LEAD. BARIUM targets\n“electronic gaming, multimedia, and internet content industries” as well as the occasional\ntech company, while LEAD is responsible for industrial espionage against manufacturing,\npharmaceutical, engineering companies and academia. The tradecraft of the two groups\ncould be distinguished at this point: BARIUM would attempt to establish rapport via social\nmedia and made use of malicious office macros, compiled HTML (.chm) files or shortcut\n(.lnk) files as first stages, while LEAD tended to just email the Winnti install package to\nvictims or brute force credentials on a server and copy down the Winnti malware.\n\nBut in an April [2017 blog, Trend Micro bound the activity together again, describing “Winnti”](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/pigs-malware-examining-possible-member-winnti-group/)\nas a criminal group that made fake antivirus engines in 2007 and shifted focus to hacking\nvideo game companies in 2009. Trend made these conclusions based on domain name\nregistrations. This is another dangerous assumption.\n\n[ProtectWise’ 401 Threat Research Group posted a couple of](https://401trg.com/winnti-evolution-going-open-source/) [blogs about the “Winnti group”a](https://401trg.com/an-update-on-winnti/)\nfew months later in July 2017, revealing the group’s use of open source tools including\nMetasploit, BeEF, and Cobalt Strike. Both blogs were later updated to make clear that they\nwere talking specifically about the LEAD group labeled by Microsoft. The 401TRG reports\nincluded some side-eye inducing conclusions. First, they included high confidence attribution\nto China. “High confidence” is usually reserved for governments that watch events happen\nover hacked closed circuit TVs - whereas these reports predated any indictments. Second,\nthe researchers didn’t provide a full explanation of how they were able to attribute activity to\nWinnti other than via stolen signing certificates. They did, on the positive side, show\n[evidence of research - including a blog that summarises the public research various parties](https://401trg.com/burning-umbrella/)\nhad done on the group so far.\n\nIn 2019, ESET attributed a software supply chain attack via Thai video games and a gaming\n[platform to a group called “Winnti”, as well as compromises of universities in Hong Kong. In a](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/01/31/winnti-group-targeting-universities-hong-kong/)\n[2019 summary of all of this activity, ESET concluded that Axiom Group and “Winnti” are](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ESET_Winnti.pdf)\nsynonymous.\n\nThat same year – five years after its blog about supply chain overlap between Chinese\n[groups – FireEye designated APT41 to be a China-based actor group responsible for a](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/08/apt41-dual-espionage-and-cyber-crime-operation.html)\nsubset of “Winnti” activity. APT41 was described as a “dual espionage and cyber crime\noperation”, conducting everything from espionage, targeting of activists, financially-motivated\nactivity, and both the ASUS and Netsarang supply chain attacks. FireEye leaned on analysis\nof the operatives’ working hours to speculate that it was a group of state-sponsored\ncontractors that also do side-gigs to make more money. FireEye bundled in to that\ndesignation previous activity it identified under the name GREF and the use of stolen digital\n\n\n-----\n\nsigning certificates, and mentioned that APT41 shared malware with seven other suspected\nChinese groups, including China Chopper and Sogu. It didn’t link it to APT27/Emissary\nPanda activity.\n\nIn [2020, Cylance, now owned by Blackberry, updated the public on its view – describing](https://www.blackberry.com/content/dam/blackberry-com/asset/enterprise/pdf/direct/report-bb-decade-of-the-rats.pdf)\nactivity that used a Linux rootkit and shared links to Android malware.This time around the\nCylance analysis put more effort into differentiating activity based on targeting, while\nacknowledging the malware was being shared between various groups.\n\nThis year, FireEye also published a blog concluding that APT41 went after many different\nkinds of victims using Citrix, Cisco and Zoho ManageEngine vulnerabilities. It again\nmentioned the use of open source tools and living off the land techniques such as\nMetasploit, BITSjobs, and Cobalt Strike.\n\nWe continue to see the name ‘Winnti’ routinely mentioned in numerous news reports. But\nwhat even is Winnti at this point?\n\n## What have we learned from “Winnti”?\n\nThe name ‘Winnti’ has been diluted to the point where it’s no longer useful. I understand the\nbenefits of using threat intelligence reporting as a form of marketing, but it’s still research,\nand should be treated accordingly.\n\nWhen relating activity to an existing group, talk to the originator about their understanding to\navoid hijacking the name.\n\nWhen your cluster diverges from the originator’s, use your own group name and explain how\nand why it diverges. Great reports often express confidence levels, talk about why links are\nsignificant, and show how different data can lead to different analysis. Using your own group\nname can also help keep other researchers from dumping their analysis, good or bad, into\nyour activity bucket without you having a say in the matter. We should prioritise the quality of\nour research over the clicks and hype from using a recognisable group name.\n\nDon’t be afraid to make updates to published research or retract them under extreme\ncircumstances. It’s better to have integrity and temporary embarrassment than have your\norganisation’s name be associated with bad attribution for eternity.\n\nI’ve made all the mistakes. And I’ve learned from them. Admitting to and learning from\nmistakes is part of the journey to good analysis. Sometimes good research requires asking\nother researchers for explanations or collaborating.\n\nResearchers should lean on better-defined actor names like LEAD and BARIUM or stick to\nnames of their own devising to avoid creating more confusion. And in case I’ve left any room\n[for doubt about what we should do with the name ‘Winnti’, here’s my suggestion.](https://giphy.com/gifs/ktcUyw6mBlMVa)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Daniel Gordon is a CTI analyst in the defence sector._\n\n\n-----",
