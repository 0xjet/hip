The proceedings are divided between the two parties with affiliates taking the larger\ncut (typically 70-80%).\n\n\n-----\n\n[Promoted by veterans of underground forums, the REvil gang developed a highly lucrative](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/a-look-inside-the-highly-profitable-sodinokibi-ransomware-business/)\nprivate operation that accepted only experienced network hackers.\n\n## REvil name goes down the drain\n\nIf the REvil operation started as an “honest” cybercriminal endeavor, it soon switched to\nscamming affiliates out of the promised 70% share of a ransom from paying victims.\n\n[Yelisey Boguslavskiy, head of research at Advanced Intel, told BleepingComputer that since](https://twitter.com/y_advintel)\nat least 2020 various actors on underground forums claimed that the RaaS operators were\ntaking over negotiations with victims in secret chats, unbeknownst to affiliates.\n\n[The rumor became more frequent after the sudden shut down of DarkSide ransomware and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-servers-reportedly-seized-operation-shuts-down/)\n[Avaddon’s exit by releasing the decryption keys for their victims.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-shuts-down-and-releases-decryption-keys/)\n\nThe conversations involved individuals that played a role in REvil ransomware attacks, such\nas partners that provided network access, penetration-testing services, VPN specialists,\nand potential affiliates.\n\n[Boguslavskiy says that REvil admins reportedly opened a second chat, identical to the one](https://twitter.com/y_advintel)\nused by their affiliate to negotiate a ransom with the victim.\n\nWhen talks reached a critical point, REvil would take over by posing as the victim quitting\nthe negotiations without paying the ransom, Boguslavskiy explained to BleepingComputer.\n\nThe gang would continue the talks with the victim and obtain the full ransom with the\naffiliate being none the wiser.\n\nRecently, these claims got more substance as an underground malware reverse engineer\nprovided evidence of REvil’s double-dipping practices. They talk of a “cryptobackdoor” in\nthe REvil samples that RaaS operators gave affiliates to deploy on victim networks.\n\nThe author’s revelation comes after cybersecurity company Bitdefender released a\n[universal REvil decryption tool that works for all victims encrypted up to July 13, 2021.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/free-revil-ransomware-master-decrypter-released-for-past-victims/)\n\n\n-----\n\nsource: [Advanced Intel](https://www.advintel.io/)\nPublic key in the image above:\n```\nFF5EEDCAEDEE6250D488F0F04EFA4C957B557BDBDC0BBCA2BA1BB7A64D043A3D\n\n```\nWhat the author of the above post is saying is that affiliates were not the only ones that\ncould decrypt the systems they locked with the REvil ransomware sample they received.\n\nREvil operators had a master key they could use to restore encrypted files.\n\n## Researcher revealed the trick in July\n\n[Fabian Wosar, “ransomware slayer” par excellence and chief technology officer at Emsisoft,](https://twitter.com/fwosar)\nin early July provided a clear explanation for how REvil’s cryptographic scheme worked.\n\nGandCrab’s successor uses in their malware four sets of public-private keys responsible for\nthe encryption and decryption tasks:\n\n1. An operator/master pair that has the public part hardcoded in all REvil samples\n2. A campaign pair, whose public part is stored in the configuration file of the malware as\n\na PK value\n3. A system-specific pair - generated upon encrypting the machine, with the private part\n\nencrypted using both the public master and campaign keys\n4. A key pair generated for each encrypted file\n\n“The private file key and public system key are then used as inputs for ECDH using\nCurve25519 in order to generate the Salsa20 key (called a shared secret) that is being\n[used to actually encrypt the file content,” Wosar explains.](https://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1411281336065794049)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe system private key is essential to unlocking a machine because it is the only one\nrequired to decrypt individual files. Recovering it is possible with either the master private\nkey - available only to REvil operators, or the campaign key that affiliates have.\n\nWosar notes that the master private key is REvil’s insurance against rogue affiliates,\nallowing them to decrypt any victim. This is also what Bitdefender used for their REvil\n[decryption tool and likely what helped Kaseya victims recover files for free.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kaseya-obtains-universal-decryptor-for-revil-ransomware-victims/)\n\nTo access the REvil payment portal, the ransomware threat actor requires a blob of data\npresent in the ransom note. That string of apparently nonsensical characters includes\nvarious data about the machine, campaign, version of the malware used, and the system\nprivate key.\n\nsource: [Fabian Wosar](https://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1411297199879823366)\nKeeping an ace up their sleeve that gives ransomware operators total control over\ndecrypting any system locked by their malware is a practice seen with other, newer\nransomware groups.\n\nBoguslavskiy says that the DarkSide ransomware gang was rumored to run their operation\nin the same way.\n\nAfter [rebranding as BlackMatter, the actor was open about this practice, letting everybody](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-gang-returns-as-new-blackmatter-operation/)\nknow that they reserved their right to take over the negotiations at any point, without\nexplaining.\n\n[Reverse engineer and Advanced Intelligence CEO Vitali Kremez told BleepingComputer](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel)\nthat the latest REvil samples, which emerged when the gang restarted operations, no\nlonger have the master key that enabled the decryption of any system locked with REvil\nransomware.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[REvil ransomware returns: New malware sample confirms gang is back](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-returns-new-malware-sample-confirms-gang-is-back/)\n\n[REvil's TOR sites come alive to redirect to new ransomware operation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revils-tor-sites-come-alive-to-redirect-to-new-ransomware-operation/)\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Decryption Key](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/decryption-key/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[REvil](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/revil/)\n[Scam](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/scam/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
