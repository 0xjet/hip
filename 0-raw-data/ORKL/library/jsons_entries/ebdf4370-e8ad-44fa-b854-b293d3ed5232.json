Our “SilverTerrier” research into the immensely prevalent](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-rat-trapped-luminositylink-falls-foul-vermin-eradication-efforts/)\nWest-African financial cybercrime has shown the tremendous popularity of commodity\nmalware empowering the largest financial cybercrime threat at this time, and especially their\nevolution towards using commodity RATs in their attacks.\n\nOne example is of the actors behind the Orcus RAT, which are the subject of recent and\n[ongoing legal action in Canada. This case continues to be prosecuted with vigor. Palo Alto](https://www.canada.ca/en/radio-television-telecommunications/news/2019/03/crtc-and-rcmp-)\nNetworks has collected more than 16,000 distinct samples of Orcus RAT since April 2016\nthrough to publishing, and we have observed more than 46,000 unique attacks using this\nRAT against Palo Alto Networks customers.\n\nWe next focused on “Imminent Monitor,” a RAT offered for sale since 2012. In comparison to\nOrcus RAT, we have more than 65,000 samples of Imminent Monitor, and observed its use\nin more than 115,000 unique attacks against Palo Alto Networks customers. This total\nnumber of samples includes those shared between antivirus vendors, not just those directly\ndetected by Palo Alto Networks customers. However, the observed attacks figure only reflects\nactual, in-the-wild samples from Palo Alto Networks customers. In most cases, repeated\nattacks using the same samples and/or blocked by signature detection will not be reflected in\nthis figure, and so the actual total number of attack attempts will be much higher than\nreflected in this metric. With such prevalence, we had to wonder why the author of this\nmalware has been allowed to continue to profit from this for almost seven years, unchecked.\n\nIn order to evaluate the potential of success of legal action against a malware author, some of\nthe first questions we ask are who are they, and where are they? This fundamental\nintelligence will drive the interest and ability of law enforcement to prosecute and inform\nresearchers to which agency they might refer to this case. In the case of Imminent Monitor,\nUnit 42’s referral and subsequent, ongoing cooperation helped initiate and drive\n[international law enforcement action to proceed with charging those responsible for the](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-media/media-releases/rat-trap-international-cybercrime-investigation-shuts-down-insidious)\ndevelopment and management of this malware, their customers, and the disabling of access\nto their victims.\n\n**Shockwave™’s RAT**\n\nIn 2012, a developer, “Shockwave™”, registered the domain imminentmethods[.]info, and in\nApril 2013 started selling his “Imminent Monitor” RAT on online forums and at his site,\nwhich later changed to imminentmethods[.]net. Earlier in 2012, he had offered a Distributed\nDenial of Service (DDoS) tool, “Shockwave™Booter,” but seemed to drop that project in favor\nof his new RAT.\n\nHe proudly claimed “the fastest remote administration tool ever created using new socket\n_technology that has never been used before.”_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Imminent Monitor 1.0 Client Control Panel_\n\nThe ImminentMonitor Client Control Panel offers a clean, easy-to-use interface to build\n(Figure 1) and control (Figure 2) ImminentMonitor client malware. As well as the full\nRemote Desktop access of any RAT, features less noticeable by the victim include:\n\nFile manager\nProcess manager\nWindow manager\nClipboard manager\nRegistry manager\nStartup manager\nCommand prompt\nTCP connection\nRemote webcam monitoring\nRemote microphone monitoring\nPassword recovery\n\nShockwave™ claimed: “We use new methods not used in any rat, the remote desktop has the\n_potential to get around 60 fps, and the cam I have personally gotten 130 with this.”_\n\nIn 2014, Imminent Monitor started supporting third-party plugins. The first of these offered\nthe ability to turn the webcam light off while monitoring. Shockwave™ wrote: “Hey, good\n_job on being the first to release a plugin for Imminent Monitor.” – a plugin with an_\nobviously illegitimate intent.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Client control_\n\n**The features of a(n il)legitimate Remote Access Tool**\n\nAs very typical with commodity RATs, the authors attempt to profess innocence and distance\nthemselves from the illegitimate features and intent of their malware:\n\n“We at Imminent Methods are not responsible for the nature in which you use our services.\n_The services sold on this website are for personal, not distributed, use and should only be_\n_used on your own machines or the machines of those who have given you expressed consent_\n_for remote management. Remember that our tools are made for educational purpose, so we_\n_do not take any responsiblity for any damage caused by any of or tools or services. Misuse_\n_of our tools or services can be very illegal. Certain misuse could cause possible jail time or_\n_fines, which differ depending on your local laws.” … “You agree that you will NOT_\n_distribute malicious files created with any of our services over the internet with the intent of_\n_harming/using machines of innocent people. You agree that if you do by some sort of_\n_means connect to a computer without authorization, by means of accident or other ways,_\n_that you will use the uninstall feature to completely remove the connection between the two_\n_of you and remove the software from their computer.” [Sic]_\n\nHowever, Shockwave™’s first-party comments online belie this claim:\n\n“The keylogger: The logs are hidden, and encrypted, fast transfer of the logs aswell, with\n_progress indicating how much of the log is downloaded”…_\n\n“The crypter: The crypter is really just a bonus feature, not always FUD but I try and do\n_my best to keep it FUD.” [Sic]_\n\nLegitimate remote access tools don’t need to hide and encrypt their logs. A crypter, allowing a\n“Fully UnDetectable” (FUD) client, only has one purpose: to attempt to evade antivirus\ndetection.\n\n\n-----\n\nLater versions include protection to help avoid detection/removal, also not a feature\nexpected of a legitimate, permissible remote access client (Figure 3).\n\n_Figure 3. \"Protection\" features_\n\nThe most recent sales page for Imminent Monitor continued to profess legitimacy (Figure 4).\n\n_Figure 4. Imminent Monitor \"About\"_\n\nHowever, features remain that lend utility rather to illegitimate use, hiding the client and\nmaintaining persistence (Figure 5).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. \"Protection\" features_\n\nShockwave™ promotes the RAT’s“protection” features:\n\n\n-----\n\n**_File Integration_**\n_The File Integration feature will delete the Imminent Monitor Client from it’s execution_\n_directory and move it into it’s “Client Startup” directory._\n\n**_Set File Properties to “Hidden”_**\n_Does what it says, marks the Client as hidden._\n\n**_Disable Taskmanager_**\n_Disables Windows Task Manager/_\n\n**_Process Security Flag & Critical Process Flag_**\n_Both of these functions are currently deprecated as the “Process Watcher” feature replaces_\n_them/_\n\n**_Process Watcher_**\n_The Process Watcher feature spawns a separate daemon to watch the main Imminent_\n_Monitor Client in case the client ever crashes or gets closed.”_\n\nMore recent versions offer what the author terms “HRDP” – Hidden Remote Desktop\nProtocol – offering a non-interactive remote desktop connection, hidden from the victim.\n\n_Figure 6. Features_\n\nVersion 3 of Imminent Monitor introduced the ability to run a cryptocurrency miner on the\nvictim machine – hardly the feature of a legitimate remote access tool (Figure 7).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Imminent Monitor Client Cryptocurrency Miner_\n\nBut, in the end, it will be the courts who will determine legitimacy and intent of the malware\nauthor, and also their customers.\n\nImminent Monitor was originally licensed to each customer for a $25 fee. Six years later, the\nprice has remained static, though new multi-license options are also offered (Figure 8).\n\n_Figure 8. Purchase_\n\n**Who is Shockwave?**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to identify actors behind such operations as Imminent Monitor, it s important to be\nthorough with analysis and intelligence collection. The actor will typically attempt to hide or\nobfuscate their identity. The research will not only aim to directly identify a specific\nindividual but also help to build a corroborative identity picture, increasing confidence in any\nanalysis.\n\nInfrastructure research did not lead us to any identifying information, though we do notice a\ndefinite preference for Australian hosting early on.\n\nForum profiles for Shockwave™ and Imminentmethods included a common profile photo, a\npanda-headed business-suited avatar (Figure 9).\n\n_Figure 9. Shockwave™/ ImminentMethods' avatar_\n\nThe Twitter account “imminentmethods” includes a location of “Queensland, Australia”. A\nGoogle+ account for imminentmethods[at]gmail.com had the same Panda avatar, and the\nname (redacted here for publication) “J████”.\n\nA deviantart.com profile for user “ViridianX” had the same panda avatar, a link to\nimminentmethods[.]info, location Australia, and the same name “J████” again. This handle\nwas corroborated in a forum post:\n\n“Also, I have noticed I have been getting imitated on various websites lately my only\n_Accounts are:_\n_shockwave.hf_\n\n\n-----\n\n_http://www.twitch.tv/imminentmethods [twitch]_\n_ViridianX [Justin.tv]”_\n\nA Paypal purchase from imminentmethods[.]net gave a merchant name “DictumFox”(Figure\n10).\n\n_Figure 10. Paypal_\n\nThis appears to be a unique handle. The site, dictumfox[.]com, previously had the site title\n“Imminent Methods”(Figure 11).\n\n_Figure 11. DictumFox-Imminent_\n_Methods_\n\nThe imminentmethods[.]net “Contact\nus” page has an Australian phone\nnumber and time zone, and a New\nSouth Wales, Australia address which comes back to a small-business services address.\n\nA search of the Australian business registry finds a “DictumFox”, with a registered agent at\nthe same address of convenience, with a different, female first name J██████ K███. She\nwas also previously linked to another Australian business, “Imminent Methods”. That\nbusiness record has a current agent with the same first name as seen in the profiles - J████\n\n- and the same surname as the female associated with the other business registration: K███.\n\nFurther research with name and location corroboration seems to possibly explain the\nrelationship with Shockwave™-J████, and the “J██████” of the corporate registration,\nbeyond the same surname K███ (Figure 12).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12. J█████ and J████_\n\n**Prosecution**\n\nUnit 42 referred the identity and activity of Shockwave™ to the Australian Federal Police\n(AFP) Cybercrime Operations teams. We have subsequently continued to assist the AFP’s\n“Operation Cepheus” (Figure 13), together with the United States Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI), and Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission,\nElectronic Commerce Enforcement / Conseil de la radiodiffusion et des télécommunications\ncanadiennes, Mise en application du commerce électronique (CRTC ECE). The Australian-led\ninvestigation, targeting not only those responsible for the development and management of\nthis malware, but also their customers using the malware illicitly, has yielded evidence\nsuggesting in excess of 14,500 customers of this RAT. We most often observe RATs employed\nillicitly by financially-motivated actors, or for data theft. Interestingly, the AFP’s\ninvestigation noted a significant number of Australian users of the software were also\nrespondents to Domestic Violence Orders. It’s unlikely a coincidence that such a tool might\nbe employed against Intimate Partner Violence victims. AFP’s operation also disabled the\nlicensing system of Imminent Monitor, removing users’ access to victims of the software.\nUnit 42’s research into the infrastructure and customers of Imminent Monitor and other\nRATs continues to assist law enforcement internationally in prosecuting the individuals\nbehind such illicit activity, demonstrating the effectiveness and potential of international\npublic/private cooperation in combating cybercrime.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12. AFP execute an Operation Cepheus search warrant (source: AFP)_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe’ve collected more than 65,000 samples of Imminent Monitor, and seen more than\n115,000 attacks against Palo Alto Networks’ customers alone. Not only did the availability of\nthis commodity malware enable each of those attacks, the author profited from the sale of it,\nsince 2013.\n\nThis Remote Access Tool, promoted first-party on hacking forums, includes features that\nhave no purpose in a legitimate tool but rather are designed to hide attacks using it.\n\nWith the successful execution of the AFP’s operation, licensed Imminent Monitor builders\nwill no longer be able to produce new client malware nor can the controllers access their\nvictims. Although cracked versions already exist and will continue to circulate, they can’t\nbenefit from bug fixes, feature enhancements, support, or efforts to improve their\nundetectability. Ironically, these versions often carry malicious payloads, acting as infection\nvectors to the criminals who would use them, themselves.\n\nOrganizations with decent spam filtering, proper system administration, and up-to-date\nWindows hosts have a much lower risk of infection.
