Yet\nsingle-client ransomware – a type of ransomware that infects individual computers, rather than\nfleets of devices – can still cause significant damage to individuals and organizations. In this\n[article, we share our analysis of a ransomware campaign isolated by HP Wolf Security in](https://hp.com/wolf)\nSeptember 2022 that targeted home users by masquerading as software updates. The\n[campaign spread Magniber, a single-client ransomware family known to demand $2,500 from](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.magniber)\nvictims. Notably, the attackers used clever techniques to evade detection, such as running the\nransomware in memory, bypassing User Account Control (UAC) in Windows, and bypassing\ndetection techniques that monitor user-mode hooks by using syscalls instead of standard\nWindows API libraries.\n\n## Campaign Overview\n\nThe infection chain starts with a web download from an attacker-controlled website. The user is\nasked to download a ZIP file containing a JavaScript file that purports to be an important antivirus or Windows 10 software update.\n\nSYSTEM.Critical.Upgrade.Win10.0.ba45bd8ee89b1.js\nSYSTEM.Security.Database.Upgrade.Win10.0.jse\nAntivirus_Upgrade_Cloud.29229c7696d2d84.jse\nALERT.System.Software.Upgrade.392fdad9ebab262cc97f832c40e6ad2c.js\n\nFigure 1 – Magniber ransomware isolated by HP Sure Click Enterprise\n\nPreviously Magniber was primarily spread through MSI and EXE files, but in September 2022 we\nstarted seeing campaigns distributing the ransomware in JavaScript files.\n\n[The JavaScript files use a variation of the DotNetToJScript technique, enabling the attacker to](https://github.com/tyranid/DotNetToJScript)\nload a .NET executable in memory, meaning the ransomware does not need to be saved to disk.\nThis technique bypasses detection and prevention tools that monitor files written to disk and\nreduces artifacts left on an infected system. The .NET code decodes shellcode and injects it into\n\n\n-----\n\n[another process. The ransomware code runs from this process – first deleting shadow copy files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/volume-shadow-copy-service)\nand disabling Windows’ backup and recovery features, before encrypting the victim’s files\n(Figure 2).\n\nMagniber requires administrator privileges to disable the victim’s ability to recover their data, so\nthe malware uses a User Account Control (UAC) bypass to runs commands without alerting the\nuser. For this to work, however, the logged-in user must be part of the Administrators group. For\nthe encryption task, the malware enumerates files and checks its file extension against a list. If\nthe extension is in the list, the file is encrypted. Finally, the malware places a ransom note in\neach directory with an encrypted file and shows it to the victim by opening the note in a web\nbrowser.\n\nFigure 2 – Magniber infection chain\n\n## Campaign Technical Analysis\n\nThe attackers behind the campaign used several interesting techniques to circumvent detection\nand prevention mechanisms, described in more detail below.\n\n### Phase 1: JavaScript Loader\n\nAs mentioned in the overview, the campaigns start with a JavaScript file compressed in a ZIP\narchive. We’ve seen both JS and JSE files used. JSE files are encoded JavaScript files. In both\ncases, the scripts are obfuscated (Figure 3).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 – Obfuscated JavaScript\n\nAfter decoding the script, we see it instantiates several MemoryStream type ActiveXObjects.\nNext, it decrypts an integer array and writes it into one of the MemoryStreams. Once this is\ndone, the MemoryStream is deserialized, giving us an executable .NET file.\n\nFigure 4 – Deobfuscated JavaScript\n\nAt this point we enter the second phase, the .NET phase.\n\n### Phase 2: .NET Binary\n\nThe .NET binary has a very simple structure since it only contains a few functions and an integer\narray, similar to the JavaScript file. When run, the code sets the memory protection of the array\n[to “PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE” and decodes an array in a similar way to the encoded](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/memory-protection-constants)\nJavaScript in the previous phase. The decoded array is shellcode which is run using the\n[EnumUILanguages function, which takes a pointer to a callback function as its first argument.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnls/nf-winnls-enumuilanguagesa)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5 – Main function inside .NET binary\n\n### Phase 3: Stage 1 Shellcode\n\nThe first shellcode stage decrypts a second stage, injects it into another process and finally runs\nit. To evade detection, both shellcode stages use syscalls instead of calling standard libraries.\n\nFigure 6 – Syscall wrapper inside shellcode\n\nThe shellcode contains its own wrapper functions that are responsible for making syscalls. To\nmake a syscall, an identifier is written to the EAX register and then the syscall function\ncorresponding to that identifier is executed. However, these identifiers can vary depending on\nthe operating system version, so the malware must account for this to support multiple versions.\nMagniber queries the operating system version and, for certain syscalls, runs through a switch\n\n-----\n\n[case statement before executing it. One example where this happens is NtCreateThreadEx. This](http://pinvoke.net/default.aspx/ntdll/NtCreateThreadEx.html)\nsyscall is used to create a new thread, in this case in another process, where shellcode is\ninjected.\n\n[Figure 7 – Syscall identifiers for NtCreateThreadEx (source)](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/syscalls/nt/64/)\n\nFigure 7 shows the NtCreateThreadEx identifiers for different version of Windows. The code\nmust use the correct identifier based on the operating system version. Using the Switch-Case\nstatements, it is possible to infer which operating systems the malware supports.\n\n_Version Code_ _Name_ _Release Date_\n\n17134 Windows 10, Version 1803 April 30, 2018\n\n17763 Windows 10, Version 1809 November 13, 2018\n\n18362 Windows 10, Version 1903 May 21, 2019\n\n18363 Windows 10, Version 1909 November 12, 2019\n\n19041 Windows 10, Version 2004 May 27, 2020\n\n19042 Windows 10, Version 20H2 October 20, 2020\n\n19043 Windows 10, Version 21H1 May 18, 2021\n\n19044 Windows 10, Version 21H2 November 16, 2021\n\n20348 Windows Server 2022, Version 21H2 August 18, 2021\n\n22000 Windows 11, Version 21H2 October 4, 2021\n\n22610 Windows 11 Insider Preview April 29, 2022\n\n22621 Windows 11, Version 22H2 September 20, 2022\n\n25115 Windows 11 Insider Preview May 11, 2022\n\n25145 Windows 11 Insider Preview June 22, 2022\n\n25163 Windows 11 Insider Preview July 20, 2022\n\nInterestingly, the Magniber sample we analyzed in September support different versions of\nWindows 11, including pre-release versions. This suggests that home users rather than\nenterprises were the intended targets of the campaign, since enterprises tend to use older\noperating systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nWith the help of syscalls, the shellcode injects decrypted shellcode into a new process and\nexecutes it, then terminates its own process.\n\n### Phase 4: Stage 2 Shellcode\n\nThis shellcode now runs in the context of another process, which is why the process chain is\ninterrupted. The purpose of this code can be divided into two parts. The first part deletes shadow\ncopy files and disables backup and recovery features. The second part recursively enumerates\nall the files on the filesystem and encrypts them based on their file extension. This part of the\nshellcode also works purely with syscalls and does not use standard libraries.\n\n### Phase 4.1: Delete Shadow Copy Files and Disable Backup and Recovery\n\nTo delete the shadow copy files and disable Windows recovery features, Magniber requires\nadministrator privileges, e.g. the user must be in the Administrators group. Most employees in\nenterprise environments don’t need such privileges, so this is another indication that the\nattackers behind the campaign intended to target individuals rather than enterprises. However,\neven if the user is in the Administrators group, the malware must first bypass User Account\n[Control, which allows a process to run with elevated privileges. Magniber uses a UAC bypass](https://winscripting.blog/2017/05/12/first-entry-welcome-and-uac-bypass/)\nthat is triggered with the following steps:\n\n1. The malware creates the registry key\n\n_HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\AppX04g0mbrz4mkc6e879rpf6qk6te730jfv\\Shell\\open\\command._\nIn this example, the key is linked from the “ms-settings” key and allows the attacker to\nspecify a shell command.\n2. The malware sets the key with the value “wscript.exe /B / E:VBScript.Encode\n\n_../../Users/Public/hnzpfrdt.tex”._\n3. The malware writes an encoded VBScript into the Public directory containing commands\n\nthat delete shadow copy files and disable backup and recovery features in Windows.\n4. The malware starts “fodhelper.exe”, a utility for managing optional features in Windows,\n\nwhich then triggers the UAC bypass. This process accesses the newly created registry key\nand runs the command stored in it, causing the VBScript to execute with elevated\nprivileges and without user confirmation.\n\nThe resulting process tree of the UAC bypass looks like this:\n\nFigure 8 – Process tree of UAC bypass using fodhelper.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nOne way to prevent the fodhelper.exe UAC bypass is to increase the UAC security level to\n“Always notify”, which stops it from working on Windows 10.\n\nThe VBScript deletes shadow copy files using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI),\n[deactivates the Windows recovery feature using the bcdedit command, then deletes the system](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/bcdedit)\n[backup using wbadmin. This makes it impossible for the user to restore the encrypted files using](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/wbadmin)\nWindows system tools.\n\nFigure 9 – VBScript that deletes shadow copy files and disables backup and recovery features\n\n### Phase 4.2: Encrypt Files\n\nTo decide which files to encrypt, Magniber keeps a list of pseudohashes that each correspond to\na different file extension. After enumerating a file, the ransomware generates a pseudohash of\nthe file extension. If the pseudohash is in the list, the file is encrypted. The encrypted file is then\nrenamed with another file extension that is unique to each Magniber sample. The ransomware\nfile extension is identical to the URL path in the ransom note.\n\nMagniber’s file extension hashes are best described as pseudohashes because no standard\nhash algorithm is used and the calculation causes hash collisions – meaning some files that\naren’t in the attacker’s list of file extensions are also encrypted. An implementation of the\nhashing function in Python looks like this:\n```\ndef pseudohash(file_ending):\n\n  hash = 0\n\n  counter = 0\n\n  for character in file_ending:\n\n    hash += ( ord(b) – 0x60 ) * ( 3 ** ( ( len(file_ending) – counter ) * 3 ) )\n\n    counter += 1\n\n  return hash\n\n```\nFinally, the ransomware tells the victim about what happened and how they can decrypt their\ndata by dropping an HTML ransom note in every directory that contains an encrypted file. To\nmake sure the user sees the demand, Magniber also opens the note in a web browser.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10 – Magniber ransom note\n\n## How to Protect Yourself\n\nHome users can protect themselves from ransomware campaigns like this one by following this\nsimple advice:\n\nFollow the [principle of least privilege by only using administrator accounts if you really](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/bsi/articles/knowledge/principles/least-privilege)\nneed to. Many home users have administrator privileges but rarely need them.\nDownload software updates from trusted sources. The campaign depends on tricking\npeople into opening fake software updates. Only download updates from trustworthy\nsources such as Windows Update and official software vendor websites.\nBack up your data regularly. Backing up your data will give you peace of mind should the\nworst happen.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEven though Magniber does not fall into the category of Big Game Hunting, it can still cause\nsignificant damage. Home users were the likely target of this malware based on the supported\noperating system versions and UAC bypass. The attackers used clever techniques to evade\nprotection and detection mechanisms. Most of the infection chain is “fileless”, meaning the\n\n\n-----\n\nmalware only resides in memory, reducing the chances of it being detected. Magniber also\nbypasses detection techniques that rely on user-mode hooks because it uses syscalls instead of\nstandard Windows API libraries. With the UAC bypass, the malware deletes the infected\nsystem’s shadow copy files and disables backup and recovery features, preventing the victim\nfrom recovering their data using Windows tools.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nReference Magniber JavaScript sample used for our analysis:\n\n934cfeb5ee3d2ba49831d76dffb1a2658326e1cd90b50779d6670eb2fbdc7ed1\n\nMagniber JavaScript
