Gemini Advisory identified a 72% increase in the volume of dark web\nforum posts referencing phishing and a 101% increase in the volume of compromised\nUS payment cards with a high likelihood of being phished that were posted to the dark\nweb.\nDark web actors are increasingly advertising bank-specific phishing pages and\nassociated services that target customers of small and mid-sized financial institutions.\nThis marks an expansion from established methods of creating generalized phishing\nsites or phishing sites for major companies with large customer bases.\nFraudsters leverage “useless” compromised payment card data and personally\nidentifiable information (PII) and “bank leads” to harvest victims’ email addresses,\nphone numbers, and financial institutions for the purpose of creating target lists.\nWhile small and mid-sized financial institutions, as well as their customers, are less\naccustomed to targeted phishing campaigns, the well-established best practices for\nprotecting against phishing attacks serve as their best mitigation strategies.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Background\n\nPayment card and bank account phishing—a method in which fraudsters trick victims into\nunwittingly providing payment card data, login credentials, or personally identifiable\ninformation (PII)—has always been a popular criminal scheme. However, many indicators\nshow that phishing attacks rose sharply in 2020. From 2019 to 2020:\n\nThe [FBI reported a 110% increase in phishing victims](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf)\nGemini identified a 72% increase in the volume of dark web forum posts referencing\nphishing\nGemini identified a 101% increase in the volume of compromised US payment cards\nwith a high likelihood of being phished that were posted for sale on the dark web\n\nAs Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has reported, the boom in phishing in 2020 has been\n[facilitated by the proliferation of phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS). PhaaS—which includes](https://www.recordedfuture.com/cybercriminals-exploit-human-nature-phishing-spam/)\ncustomized phishing pages, “outsourced” spam phishing campaigns, and other web traffic\nschemes—makes it easier for less technically sophisticated fraudsters to engage in phishing,\nthereby increasing the pool of attackers. Furthermore, COVID-19 restrictions forced many\nfraudsters to look for criminal profits outside of well-established methods of exposing inperson transactions, known as Card Present (CP) transactions. Phishing, made easier\nthrough PhaaS, has offered fraudsters a way to seek new sources of profits by using fake\nsites to compromise payment card data, PII, login credentials, and bank account information.\n\n\n-----\n\nHistorically, the most common method of phishing has been mass phishing. With this\nmethod, fraudsters hope to draw victims to their “bait” (a phishing page for a massive\ncompany or financial institution, or simply an enticing offer like discounted medications) by\nphishing in a “large pond” (sending out spam emails to “random” recipients or creating\nphishing ads through Google or Facebook). The idea is simple: most potential victims will not\ntake the bait, but the pond is big enough and the bait is “generalized” enough that even a\nsmall percentage is enough to turn a profit.\n\nFor this reason, fraudsters have largely avoided using small and mid-sized financial\ninstitutions as bait in this analogy. Throw a phishing page for a small regional bank into that\nlarge pond and the already small percentage of victims becomes so small that it is not worth\nthe time or effort for most fraudsters.\n\nHowever, analysis of phished records posted to the dark web, and the chatter occurring on\ndark web forums, shows that the game has changed. In the past year, fraudsters have\nincreasingly found ways to shrink the pond and make sure the fish in the pond are customers\nof small and mid-sized financial institutions. As a result, fraudsters are now creating phishing\npages for specific small and mid-sized financial institutions, identifying their customers, and\ntargeting them with phishing attacks. Unfortunately, both the institutions themselves and their\ncustomers may be unprepared for the rising threat, rendering them soft targets in the eyes of\nfraudsters.\n\n## Fraudsters Turn Their Phish Eyes to Small and Mid-sized Financial Institutions\n\nSince January 2018, the volume of phished records posted to the dark web has steadily\nincreased, with metrics for small and mid-sized US financial institutions dovetailing the\nmetrics for large US financial institutions. This is expected as the majority of phishing sites\nare generalized and non-bank specific, suggesting a broadly proportional distribution of\nexposed cards per the size of each financial institution.\n\nImportantly, the volume of phished records from small and mid-sized financial institutions\nincreased at a higher rate—14 more percentage points—than records from large financial\ninstitutions when comparing the past 18 months to the preceding 18-month period.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of rising phishing attacks, Gemini Advisory has also witnessed the\nsteady emergence of dark web actors advertising phishing sites and services for “semitargeted” phishing attacks against customers of small and mid-sized institutions.\nCorrespondingly, actors are increasingly seeking and selling data that can be used to create\ntarget lists of these institutions’ customers. These semi-targeted phishing attacks use\naspects of both mass phishing and spear phishing—which are personalized phishing attacks\nagainst individuals—to launch phishing campaigns that specifically target customers of small\nand mid-sized financial institutions.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Why Small and Mid-sized Financial Institutions Make Bad Bait for Mass Phishing**\n\nIn the context of bank and card fraud phishing, mass phishing relies on two methods of\ndelivering the “bait”, which refers to the phishing page that captures victims’ data:\n\nThe large-scale distribution of generalized spam emails that contain links to a phishing\npage\n\nAlthough mass phishing is the most common type of phishing attack, it is not cost-effective,\nand the life cycle of a mass phishing campaign is very short. The key aspect of mass\nphishing is that the bait are typically:\n\nWidely-used companies, such as Amazon or Netflix, for phishing payment card data\nand PII\nMajor financial institutions with the largest customer bases for phishing online bank\naccount login credentials, payment card data, and PII\nAttractive offers, such as investment opportunities, cryptocurrency information, or\npharmacology deals\n“Scary” threats, such as urgent requests for tax information\n\n\n-----\n\nImages 1-2: A phishing page for a large financial institution that was posted for sale by the\ndark web actor “iHack”. Fraudsters use ID verification pages to trick victims into providing\npayment card data and PII.\n\nIf the fraudsters deliver the phishing bait through spam emails, they typically purchase or\nfreely download one of the many spam email databases on offer on dark web forums. The\nidea is that the mimicked company is so large, they will likely still have a high number of\ncustomers in their distribution list.\n\nIf fraudsters use Google or Facebook ads to deliver the bait, they create an ad and may\nselect some criteria—such as region, age, or gender—to narrow the audience by choosing\nspecific interests. Actors on dark web forums frequently advertise their services to create\ntailored ads designed to drive traffic to bank phishing sites, and other actors regularly create\nposts seeking these services.\n\nAlthough using Google and Facebook ads to drive visitors to phishing sites is typically\nreserved for more typical mass phishing campaigns, fraudsters can leverage these ads for\nsmall and mid-sized financial institutions. For these smaller institutions, the success rates of\nad-driven phishing campaigns would typically be lower than phishing emails to identified\nbank clients; however, fraudsters could increase their odds by phishing for a small regional\nbank and setting their ads to focus on individuals residing in the area of the regional bank.\n\nDespite the fact that mass phishing is better suited to phishing at large financial institutions\nand companies, these larger organizations have greatly improved their capacity to detect\nand disrupt phishing attacks against their customers. To counter spam emails, large financial\ninstitutions and email providers have partnered to implement systems like DMARC that block\n\n\n-----\n\n[phishing emails before they arrive in potential victims inboxes. At the same time, threat](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/02/01/email-phishing-detection-and-response-basicsare-spf-dkim-and-dmarc-enough-to-protect-you/?sh=60be36c03c3d)\nintelligence companies now offer services designed to proactively identify typosquatted\ndomains used as phishing sites.\n\nNotably, large organizations’ capacity to leverage these tools to mitigate phishing attacks is\none of the major contributing factors that has driven fraudsters to devise new phishing\ntechniques for targeting comparatively less protected small and mid-sized financial\ninstitutions.\n\n## How Fraudsters Find Phishing Victims for Small and Mid-sized Financial Institutions\n\nFor fraudsters to target customers of small and mid-sized financial institutions, they need to\nknow who the customers are. While customer databases containing email addresses are\neasily accessible for large companies on the dark web, they rarely exist for banks.\nConversely for major banks, fraudsters are happy to roll the dice with mass phishing, safe in\nthe knowledge that those banks’ customer bases are large enough for an acceptable\nsuccess rate.\n\nTo get around this issue, fraudsters have begun devising new methods of converting\ncompromised personal data with a low price on dark web forums into target lists for small\nand mid-sized financial institutions. From there, they launch semi-targeted and spear\nphishing attacks to achieve higher rates of success from smaller, “stocked” ponds of potential\nvictims.\n\n**Method 1: Leveraging “Useless” Compromised Data to Find Victims**\n\nOne of the main methods involves leveraging compromised payment card records and bank\nlogs that are no longer valuable to most cybercriminals for conventional fraud schemes, and\nthen harvesting from them their victims’ contact information and the financial institution. Bank\nlogs are files that contain victims’ login credentials, cookies, PII, and other information that\nwere stolen by cybercriminals through a variety of means, including phishing, keyloggers, or\nvarious malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 3: On November 18, 2020, the actor thyjew on a top-tier dark web forum sought to\npurchase invalid, expired, or “dead” compromised payment card records that contained the\nvictim’s phone number. The actor could leverage this information for phone call spear\nphishing or SMS-based semi-targeted phishing.\n\nThese records and bank logs are most valuable when they can be monetized through\nfraudulent transactions, account takeovers, or other cashout schemes. But once a payment\ncard expires, or a bank reissues a card due to fraudulent activity, or a bank re-secures a\ncompromised online bank account, the records and bank logs lose almost all their value and\nbecome “useless”. As a result, these records and bank logs sell for pennies on the dark web\nand allow fraudsters to cheaply acquire and clean the data they need.\n\nWhereas bank logs always contain information about the victim’s financial institution and\noverwhelmingly contain the victim’s email address or phone number, compromised payment\ncard records typically contain contact info if the breached source collected that info during\ncheckout. In the past year, 47% of the 7 million US payment card records from small and\nmid-sized financial institutions that were compromised during online transactions contained\neither the victim’s email address or phone number.\n\nCompromised payment card records do not contain overtly explicit information about the\nvictim’s financial institution, but fraudsters can use widely available “BIN checkers” or “BIN\nlists” to determine the financial institution of compromised payment card records. BIN\ncheckers allow fraudsters to input the first 6 to 8 digits of the compromised card and receive\nthe name of the financial institution that issued the card. BIN lists, which are lists of BINs and\ntheir corresponding financial institution, are frequently freely posted on dark web forums.\n\n**Method 2: Pivoting Off “Bank Leads”**\n\nThe second method involves purchasing so-called “bank leads” from other cybercriminals.\nTypically, these cybercriminals acquired a victim’s contact information, their financial\ninstitution, and other associated PII, but did not acquire the more lucrative payment card\n\n\n-----\n\ndata, account information, or login credentials. As a result, these bank leads are priced\nsignificantly cheaper than those with payment card data, account information, or login\ncredentials. Bank leads typically come from mass phishing campaigns or the compromised\ndatabases of payment processors and marketing companies.\n\nImage 4: On July 22, 2021, the actor “posman” on a top-tier dark web forum offered to sell\nbank leads that fraudsters could use for phishing campaigns targeting small and mid-sized\nfinancial institutions.\n\n## Semi-Targeted Phishing for Small and Mid-sized Financial Institutions\n\nOnce a fraudster has their list of victims for a small or mid-sized financial institution, they can\nattempt to lure them in through methods similar to mass phishing. With these methods, they\ncreate a fake phishing page for the bank that they are targeting. They then distribute\nphishing emails if they have collected customers’ email addresses or distribute phishing text\nmessages if they collected phone numbers.\n\nImportantly, although email providers have improved their spam filtering systems and end\nusers have become more savvy to phishing threats, the rise of criminal software like Email\nAppender has given fraudsters new avenues to bypass these protections and increase their\nchances of success.\n\nAdditionally, while many fraudsters may not have the technical expertise to create viable,\nconvincing phishing pages, threat actors on dark web forums regularly advertise their\nservices to create customized phishing pages for any financial institution. These actors\ntypically include examples of their fake sites, which may include large entities but frequently\nalso include small and mid-sized financial institutions.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nImage 5: The actor ninesmoney thanks iHack for creating a customized phishing page of\nVirginia Credit Union for them. iHack regularly advertises their services creating phishing\npages on a mid-tier dark web forum.\n\nFurthermore, actors on dark web forums also advertise services to drive web traffic to\nphishing sites through either phishing emails or online ads. In practice, the combination of\nservices for creating customized phishing pages and driving web traffic to the sites enables\nfraudsters with comparatively limited technical expertise or time to service out key functions.\n\nImage 6: The actor “GoldByt” on a mid-tier Russian language dark web forum seeks partners\nthat can direct internet traffic to their phishing site for Municipal Credit Union.\n\n## Spear Phishing at Small and Mid-sized Financial Institutions\n\nAlternatively, once the fraudster has their list of victims, they can attempt to lure in their victim\nwith spear phishing techniques. Spear phishing refers to attacks targeting a single individual,\nor in some cases a small company, in which the attacker uses personal information to\ndeceive the victim into believing the attacker is a trustworthy interlocutor. Spear phishing is\ntypically conducted through phone calls or personalized emails and requires the fraudster to\ncustomize each attack to each victim. As a result, the fraudster must devote more time and\nresources to each attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs noted above, the data about victims that fraudsters collect must include either email\naddresses or phone numbers to be useful. If the data includes phone numbers, the fraudster\ncould spoof their calling number in order to impersonate a victim’s bank and then call the\nvictim. The fraudster would attempt to manipulate the victim into divulging sensitive\ninformation over the phone by asking “typical” ID verification questions, such as date of birth\nand address, and then sneak in other questions, like Social Security number or login\ninformation. Alternatively, the fraudster could convince the victim to navigate to a phishing\npage—likely distributed by text message or email during the conversation—whereupon the\nvictim would then input sensitive information.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWhile the techniques that fraudsters use to collect target lists for small and mid-sized\nfinancial institutions differ from those used for large banks and prominent companies, the\nbest practices for mitigating the dangers are largely the same.\n\nThe key difference is that the historical lack of cybercriminal focus on creating phishing\npages for small and mid-sized financial institutions may have led some of these financial\ninstitutions to underestimate the current threat that they face. As a result, there is now\ngreater pressure on these financial institutions to ensure they have processes in place to\nmonitor for phishing attacks mimicking their institution and that their customers are properly\ninformed of the dangers.\n\nFor individuals with an account at a small or mid-sized financial institution, the best way to\nprotect yourself is to take an extra second to make sure the person you’re speaking with, or\nthe site you’re visiting, is truly who you believe them to be.\n\nIf you receive a call from a person claiming to be a bank representative:\n\nAsk them to provide you with an extension that can be used with a phone number listed\non their website. If you are not provided with a phone number matching the bank’s\nofficial listed numbers, call one of the bank’s official numbers and inform them.\n\nIf you receive an email claiming to be from your bank:\n\nIt is best to avoid clicking any links in the email. Instead, log in to your bank account\ndirectly from a browser to review any possible alerts. Alternatively, call your bank at a\nnumber listed on their website.\nVerify where the link will send you by hovering over it. If it shows a domain that does\nnot exactly match the domain of your financial institution, do not click it.\nDouble-check the sender’s email address to verify that it is truly coming from a bankaffiliated email address. Search the sender’s email address on a search engine to see\nif that email address has been previously reported as fraudulent. Alternatively, verify\nthat the display name for the email’s sender field has not been spoofed.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlways practice extra caution if a bank requires you to provide extensive payment card\ndata and PII to “verify” your identity when logging in. For non-bank sites, always\nconfirm that the amount of PII you are providing matches the product or service you are\npurchasing.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe development of novel techniques to target customers of small and mid-sized financial\ninstitutions with phishing attacks has been facilitated by the emergence of various\ncybercriminal phishing services. Due to the ease with which fraudsters can order a custommade phishing page and pay other actors to direct traffic to their site, the only barrier\npreventing fraudsters from ramping up the targeting of small and mid-sized financial\ninstitutions is the availability of victim data that contains their financial institution and an email\naddress or phone number.\n\nAs more fraudsters find ways to extract victims’ information and begin to see the value in\nselling this data, the result will likely be a further rise in phishing attacks against customers of\nsmall and mid-sized financial institutions. As these types of attacks rely on deceiving the\nvictim as opposed to lax security, the best strategy for individuals is to follow the wellestablished security practices for phishing. For small and mid-sized financial institutions\nthemselves, the best strategy is to ensure they have processes in place to monitor for\nphishing attacks targeting their clients and to keep clients well-informed of the dangers.\n\n**Gemini Advisory Mission Statement**\n\n_Gemini Advisory provides actionable fraud intelligence to the largest financial organizations_\n_in an effort to mitigate ever-growing cyber risks.
