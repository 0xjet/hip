You might be sent\none in a message; somebody might insert one under a social media post or you could be\nprovided with one on basically any website. Users or websites providing these links might\nuse URL shortener services. These are used to shorten long URLs, hide original domain\nnames, view analytics about the devices of visitors, or in some cases even monetize their\nclicks.\n\nMonetization means that when someone clicks on such a link, an advertisement, such as\nthe examples in Figure 1, will be displayed that will generate revenue for the person who\ngenerated the shortened URL. The problem is that some of these link shortener services\nuse aggressive advertising techniques such as scareware ads: informing users their\ndevices are infected with dangerous malware, directing users to download dodgy apps from\nthe Google Play store or to participate in shady surveys, delivering adult content, offering to\nstart premium SMS service subscriptions, enabling browser notifications, and making\ndubious offers to win prizes.\n\nWe’ve even seen link shortener services pushing “calendar” files to iOS devices and\ndistributing Android malware – indeed, we discovered one piece of malware we named\nAndroid/FakeAdBlocker, which downloads and executes additional payloads (such as\nbanking trojans, SMS trojans, and aggressive adware) received from its C&C server.\n\nBelow we describe the iOS calendar-event-creating downloads and how to recover from\nthem, before spending most of the blogpost on a detailed analysis of the distribution of\nAndroid/FakeAdBlocker and, based on our telemetry, its alarming number of detections.\nThis analysis is mainly focused on the functionality of the adware payload and, since it can\ncreate spam calendar events, we have included a brief guide detailing how to automatically\nremove them and uninstall Android/FakeAdBlocker from compromised devices.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Examples of shady aggressive advertisements\n\n## Distribution\n\nContent displayed to the victim from monetized link shorteners can differ based on the\nrunning operating system. For instance, if a victim clicked on the same link on a Windows\ndevice and on a mobile device, a different website would be displayed on each device.\nBesides websites, they could also offer an iOS device user to download an ICS calendar\nfile, or an Android device user to download an Android app. Figure 2 outlines options we\nhave seen in the campaign analyzed here.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Malware distribution process\n\nWhile some advertisements and Android applications served by these monetized shortened\nlinks are legitimate, we observed that the majority lead to shady or unwanted behavior.\n\n### iOS targets\n\nOn iOS devices, besides flooding victims with unwanted ads, these websites can create\nevents in victims’ calendars by automatically downloading an ICS file. As the screenshots in\nFigure 3 show, victims must first tap the subscribe button to spam their calendars with these\nevents. However, the calendar name “Click OK To Continue (sic)” is not revealing the true\ncontent of those calendar events and only misleads the victims into tapping the Subscribe\nand Done button.\n\nThese calendar events falsely inform victims that their devices are infected with malware,\nhoping to induce victims to click on the embedded links, which lead to more scareware\nadvertisements.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Scam website requests user to subscribe to calendar events on iOS platform\n\n\n-----\n\n### Android targets\n\nFor victims on Android devices, the situation is more dangerous because these scam\nwebsites might initially provide the victim with a malicious app to download and afterwards\nproceed with visiting or downloading the actual expected content searched for by the user.\n\nThere are two scenarios for Android users that we observed during our research. In the first\none, when the victim wants to download an Android application other than from Google\nPlay, there is a request to enable browser notifications from that website, followed by a\nrequest to download an application called adBLOCK app.apk. This might create the illusion\nthat this adBLOCK app will block displayed advertisements in the future, but the opposite is\ntrue. This app has nothing to do with the legitimate adBLOCK application available from the\nofficial source.\n\nWhen the user taps on the download button, the browser is redirected to a different website\nwhere the user is apparently offered an ad-blocking app named adBLOCK, but ends up\ndownloading Android/FakeAdBlocker. In other words, the victim’s tap or click is hijacked and\nused to download a malicious application. If the victim returns to the previous page and taps\non the same download button, the correct legitimate file that the intended victim wanted is\ndownloaded onto the device. You can watch one of the examples in the video below.\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ps2QS0Oquos\n\nIn the second Android scenario, when the victims want to proceed with downloading the\nrequested file, they are shown a web page describing the steps to download and install an\napplication with the name Your File Is Ready To Download.apk. This name is obviously\n\n\n-----\n\nmisleading; the name of the app is trying to make the user think that what is being\ndownloaded is the app or a file they wanted to access. You can see the demonstration in\nthe video below.\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/iogUoGf1RxY\n\nIn both cases, a scareware advertisement or the same Android/FakeAdBlocker trojan is\n[delivered via a URL shortener service. Such services employ the Paid to click (PTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_to_click)\nbusiness model and act as intermediaries between customers and advertisers. The\nadvertiser pays for displaying ads on the PTC website, where part of that payment goes to\nthe party that created the shortened link. As stated on one of these link shortening websites\nin the privacy policy section, these ads are via their advertising partners and they are not\nresponsible for delivered content or visited websites.\n\nOne of the URL shortener services states in its terms of service that users should not create\nshortened links to transmit files that contain viruses, spyware, adware, trojans or other\nharmful code. To the contrary, we have observed that their ad partners are doing it.\n\n## Telemetry\n\nBased on our detection data, Android/FakeAdBlocker was spotted for the first time in\nSeptember 2019. Since then, we have been detecting it under various threat names. From\nthe beginning of this year till July 1st, we have seen more than 150,000 instances of this\nthreat being downloaded to Android devices.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. ESET detection telemetry for Android/FakeAdBlocker\n\nFigure 5. Top ten countries by proportion of Android/FakeAdBlocker detections (January 1st – July\n\n1st 2021)\n\n## Android/FakeAdBlocker analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter downloading and installing Android/FakeAdBlocker, the user might realize that, as\nseen in Figure 6, it has a white blank icon and, in some cases, even has no app name.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. App icon of Android/FakeAdBlocker\n\nAfter its initial launch, this malware decodes a base64-encoded file with a .dat extension\nthat is stored in the APK’s assets. This file contains C&C server information and its internal\nvariables.\n\nFigure 7. Decoded config file from APK assets\n\nFrom its C&C server it will request another configuration file. This has a binary payload\nembedded, which is then extracted and dynamically loaded.\n\nFigure 8. Android/FakeAdBlocker downloads an additional payload\n\nFor most of the examples we have observed, the this payload was responsible for\ndisplaying out-of-context ads. However, in hundreds of cases, different malicious payloads\nwere downloaded and executed. Based on our telemetry, the C&C server returned different\n[payloads based on the location of the device. The Cerberus banking trojan was](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/cerberus-a-new-banking-trojan-from-the-underworld.html)\n\n\n-----\n\ndownloaded to devices in Turkey, Poland, Spain, Greece and Italy. It was disguised as\nChrome, Android Update, Adobe Flash Player, Update Android, or Google Guncelleme app\n(guencelleme is Turkish for “update” so the name of the app is Google Update). In Greece\n[we have also seen the Ginp banking trojan being downloaded. The same malware family](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/ginp_a_malware_patchwork_borrowing_from_anubis.html)\nvariant of SMS trojan was distributed in the Middle East. Besides these trojans, Bitdefender\n[Labs also identified the TeaBot (also known as Anatsa) banking trojan being downloaded as](https://www.cleafy.com/documents/teabot)\na payload by Android/FakeAdBlocker. Payloads are downloaded to external media storage\nin the files subdirectory of the parent app package name using various app names. A list of\npayload APK names is included in the IoCs section.\n\nThe emerging fact that the C&C server can at any time distribute different malicious\npayloads makes this threat unpredictable. Since all aforementioned trojans have already\nbeen analyzed, we will continue with the analysis of the adware payload that was\ndistributed to more than 99% of the victims. The adware payload bears many code\nsimilarities with the downloader so we are classifying both in the same\nAndroid/FakeAdBlocker malware family.\n\nAlthough the payloads download in the background, the victim is informed about actions\nhappening on the mobile device by the activity displayed saying file is being downloaded.\nOnce everything is set up, the Android/FakeAdBlocker adware payload asks the victim for\npermission to draw over other apps, which will later result in it creating fake notifications to\ndisplay advertisements in the foreground, and for permission to access the calendar.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Activity shown after start\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Permission request to control what is displayed in foreground\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Permission request to edit calendar events\n\nAfter all permissions are enabled, the payload silently starts to create events in Google\nCalendar for upcoming months.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. Scareware calendar events created by malware (above) and detail (below)\n\nIt creates eighteen events happening every day, each of them lasts 10 minutes. Their\nnames and descriptions suggest that the victim’s smartphone is infected, user data is\nexposed online or that a virus protection app is expired. Descriptions of each event include\na link that leads the victim to visit a scareware advertisement website. That website again\nclaims the device has been infected and offers the user to download shady cleaner\napplications from Google Play.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. Titles and descriptions of the events (left) and the reminder displayed by one of them\n\n(right)\n\nAll the event title names and their descriptions can be found the malware’s code. Here are\nall scareware event texts created by the malware, verbatim. If you find one of these in your\nGoogle Calendar, you are or were most likely a victim of this threat.\n\n⚠ Hackers may try to steal your data!\n\n_Block ads, viruses and pop-ups on YouTube, Facebook, Google, and your favorite_\n_websites.

Examples of displayed scareware ads\n\nClicking on any of these would lead the user to a website with further scareware content\nthat suggests that the victim install cleaners or virus removers from Google Play. We have\n[already written about similar shady apps impersonating security software in 2018.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/05/google-play-ad-slingers/)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Uninstall process\n\nTo identify and remove Android/FakeAdBlocker, including its dynamically loaded adware\npayload, you need to first find it among your installed applications, by going to Settings ->\nApps. Because the malware doesn’t have an icon or an app name (see Figure 15), it should\nbe easy to spot. Once located, tap it once to select it and then tap on Uninstall button and\nconfirm the request to remove the threat.\n\nFigure 15. Manual uninstallation of malware\n\n### How to automatically remove spam events\n\nUninstalling Android/FakeAdBlocker will not remove the spam events it created in your\ncalendar. You can remove them manually; however, it would be a tedious job. This task can\nalso be done automatically, using an app. During our tests we successfully removed all\nthese events using a free app available from the Google Play store called Calendar\nCleanup. A problem with this app is that it removes only past events. Because of that, to\nremove upcoming events, temporarily change the current time and date in the settings of\nthe device to be the day after the last spam event created by the malware. That would\nmake all these events expired and Calendar Cleanup can then automatically remove them\nall.\n\nIt is important to state that this app removes all events, not just the ones created by the\nmalware. Because of that, you should carefully select the targeted range of days.\n\nOnce the job is done, make sure to reset the current time and date.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on our telemetry, it appears that many users tend to download Android apps from\noutside of Google Play, which might lead them to download malicious apps delivered\nthrough aggressive advertising practices that are used to generate revenue for their\nauthors. We identified and demonstrated this vector of distribution in the videos above.\nAndroid/FakeAdBlocker downloads malicious payloads provided by its operator’s C&C\nserver; in most cases, after launch these hide themselves from user view, deliver unwanted\nscareware or adult content advertisements and create spam calendar events for upcoming\nmonths. Trusting these scareware ads might cost their victims money either by sending\npremium rate SMS messages, subscribing to unnecessary services, or downloading\nadditional and often malicious applications. Besides these scenarios, we identified various\nAndroid banking trojans and SMS trojans being downloaded and executed.\n\n## IoCs\n\n**Hash** **Detection name**\n\nB0B027011102B8FD5EA5502D23D02058A1BFF1B9 Android/FakeAdBlocker.A\n\nE51634ED17D4010398A1B47B1CF3521C3EEC2030 Android/FakeAdBlocker.B\n\n696BC1E536DDBD61C1A6D197AC239F11A2B0C851 Android/FakeAdBlocker.C\n\n## C&Cs\n\nemanalyst[.]biz\nmmunitedaw[.]info\nommunite[.]top\nrycovernmen[.]club\nransociatelyf[.]info\nschemics[.]club\nomeoneha[.]online\nsityinition[.]top\nfceptthis[.]biz\noftongueid[.]online\nhoneiwillre[.]biz\neaconhop[.]online\nssedonthep[.]biz\nfjobiwouldli[.]biz\nofferanda[.]biz\n\n### File paths of downloaded payloads\n\n\n-----\n\n/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.intensive.sound/files/Download/updateandroid.apk\n/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.intensive.sound/files/Download/Chrome05.12.11.apk\n/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.intensive.sound/files/Download/XXX_Player.apk\n/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.confidential.pottery/files/Download/Google_Update.apk\n/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.confidential.pottery/files/Download/System.apk\n/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.confidential.pottery/files/Download/AndroidUpdate.5.1.apk\n/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.cold.toothbrush/files/Download/Android_Update.apk\n/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.cold.toothbrush/files/Download/chromeUpdate.apk\n/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.cold.toothbrush/files/Download/FreeDownloadVideo.apk\n/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.anaconda.brave/files/Download/MediaPlayer.apk\n/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.anaconda.brave/files/Download/GoogleChrome.apk\n/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.dusty.bird/files/Download/Player.apk\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n\n[This table was built using version 9 of the ATT&CK framework.](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/versions/)\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n\nInitial\nAccess\n\n\nT1476 Deliver Malicious App via\nOther Means\n\n\nAndroid/FakeAdBlocker can be\ndownloaded from third-party\nwebsites.\n\n\nT1444 Masquerade\nas\nLegitimate\nApplication\n\n\nAndroid/FakeAdBlocker\nimpersonates legitimate\nAdBlock app.\n\n\nPersistence T1402 Broadcast Receivers Android/FakeAdBlocker listens\nfor the BOOT_COMPLETED\nbroadcast, ensuring that the\napp’s functionality will be\nactivated every time the device\nstarts.\n\n\nT1541 Foreground\nPersistence\n\n\nAndroid/FakeAdBlocker\ndisplays transparent\nnotifications and pop-up\nadvertisements.\n\n\nDefense\nEvasion\n\n\nT1407 Download New Code at\nRuntime\n\n\nAndroid/FakeAdBlocker\ndownloads and executes an\nAPK filefiles from a malicious\nadversary server.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n\nT1406 Obfuscated\nFiles or\nInformation\n\nT1508 Suppress\nApplication\nIcon\n\n\nAndroid/FakeAdBlocker\nstores base64-encoded\nfile in assets containing\nconfig file with C&C\nserver.\n\nAndroid/FakeAdBlocker’s\nicon is hidden from its\nvictim’s view.\n\n\nCollection T1435 Access Calendar Entries Android/FakeAdBlocker creates\nscareware events in calendar.\n\n\nCommand\nAnd\nControl\n\n\nT1437 Standard Application\nLayer Protocol\n\n\nAndroid/FakeAdBlocker\ncommunicates with C&C via\nHTTPS.\n\nAndroid/FakeAdBlocker\ngenerates revenue by\nautomatically displaying ads.\n\n\nImpact T1472 Generate Fraudulent\nAdvertising Revenue\n\n20 Jul 2021 - 02:00PM\n\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n\n-----\n\n### Discussion\n\n\n-----",
