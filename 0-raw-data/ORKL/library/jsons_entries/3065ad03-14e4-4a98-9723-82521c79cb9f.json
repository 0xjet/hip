DoNot are reported to be the\n[main developers and users of Windows and Android spyware frameworks [1][2][3].](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/donot-team-leverages-new-modular-malware-framework-south-asia)\n\nMorphisec Labs has tracked the group’s activity and now exclusively details the latest updates to the group’s\nWindows framework, a.k.a. YTY, Jaca. In this blog post, we briefly discuss the history of the DoNot team and shed\nlight on updates revealed by the latest samples found in the wild.\n\n## APT-C-35/DoNot Background\n\n[The DoNot Team is consistent with their TTPs, infrastructure, and targets. They’re also well known for their](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/tactics_techniques_and_procedures)\ncontinuous updates and improvements to their toolkit.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group mainly targets entities in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and other South Asian countries. They\nfocus on [government and military organizations, ministries of foreign affairs, and embassies.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/01/18/donot-go-do-not-respawn/)\n\nFor initial infection, the DoNot Team uses spear phishing emails containing malicious attachments. (Related: spear\n[phishing campaigns have become the preferred delivery method for ransomware.) To load the next stage they](https://blog.morphisec.com/three-trends-ransomware-attacks-more-dangerous)\nleverage Microsoft Office macros and RTF files exploiting Equation Editor vulnerability and remote template injection.\n\nKnown TTPs, or malware commonalities, include:\n\nModular architecture where each module is delivered in a separate file\nFunctionalities: file collection, screenshots, keylogging, reverse shell, browser stealing, and gathering system\ninformation\nVarious programming languages such as, C++, .NET, Python, etc.\nUtilizing Google Drive to store command and control (C2) server addresses\nMultiple domains used for different purposes throughout the infection chain\n\nAll previously known framework variants attributed to the DoNot Team share similar attributes.\n\nMorphisec Labs has identified a new DoNot infection chain that introduces new modules to the Windows framework.\nIn this post we detail the shellcode loader mechanism and its following modules, identify new functionality in the\nbrowser stealer component, and analyze a new DLL variant of the reverse shell.\n\n## Mapping a Malware Route\n\n\n-----\n\n_Delivery pathway to infect a machine_\n\nDoNot’s latest spear phishing email campaign used RTF documents and targeted government departments, including\nPakistan’s defence sector. When the RTF document is opened, it tries to fetch a malicious remote template from its\nC2 by sending an HTTP GET request in the form: <domain>/<X>/<Y>.php. If the User-Agent for that request doesn’t\ncontain MSOffice, which is case sensitive and added by default in Office applications, the C2 returns a decoy\ndocument with empty content. Otherwise, it downloads and injects a macro weaponized document. This technique\nmay trick a security solution that tries to scan the URL without the MSOffice User-Agent header and mark it as clear.\nThe remote template URLs are active for a limited period of time which makes analysis difficult.\n\n## Pre-Shellcode Execution\n\nWhen a remote template is injected, it lures the victim to enable editing and content to allow the malicious macros to\nexecute. Once macros are enabled, the Document_open routine executes and starts with a for loop to delay the\nmalicious code execution, and then calls to the appropriate function based on the Winword.exe bitness.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Document_open routine code_\n\nThe function injects a shellcode (32-bit/64-bit) into the process memory and invokes it. The shellcode is injected using\nthe following three WinAPI functions:\n\n1. ZwAllocateVirtualMemory—Allocates virtual memory with Execute/Read/Write permission\n2. MultiByteToWideChar—Maps the shellcode character string to UTF-16\n3. EnumUILanguagesA—Passes the shellcode as a callback parameter. Other variants also use the\n\nInternal_EnumSystemCodePages WinAPI\n\n_WinAPI calls used for the shellcode execution_\n\n## Delivering the Payload\n\nBefore the execution of the payload, the shellcode decrypts itself using a simple decryption routine—not followed by\nxor with a two-byte key, which changes between stages. After the shellcode is invoked, it starts execution by\ndecrypting the rest of the shellcode bytes and passing the execution to the next stage.\n\n_Shellcode decryption routine before decrypting the next chunk_\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, the shellcode downloads an encrypted blob from its C2: <domain>/<X>/<Y><Z>.ico (for the 32 bit shellcode) or\n_<domain>/<X>/<Y><Z>.png (for the 64-bit shellcode) and decrypts it. The decrypted blob is the second-stage_\nshellcode, and like the first stage shellcode, it starts by decrypting the rest of the bytes in the shellcode before\npassing execution to the next stage.\n\nIn the 64-bit version of the first stage shellcode, the actor left what seem to be strings belonging to the configuration\nof the shellcode builder:\n\n'sm\\\\INCLUDE\\\\PCOUNT\\\\SHELL32.INC'\n\ninclude 'c:\\\\Fasm\\\\INCLUDE\\\\WIN32AXP.INC'\n\ninclude 'Shellcodes\\\\MyAssemblyMacros\\\\MyAssemblyMacrosMain.INC'\n\n;if debugging turn this bit on\n\ndebug = 0\n\nxor_key_main = 0xAD\n\nxor_key_payload = 0xFE\n\nxor_key_url = 0xCE\n\nexpiry_year_date = 0x7e6070f\n\nmcafee_expiry_year_date = 0\n\navg_expiry_year_date = 0\n\nnorton_expiry_year_date = 0\n\nbitdefender_expiry_year_date = 0x7e6070f\n\neset_expiry_year_date = 0x7e60717\n\ndefine_real_variable local_path_exe_env, '%tmp%\\\\..\\\\winsvsc.exe',0\n\ndefine_real_variable tmp_env_path, '%tmp%\\\\document.doc',0\n\ndefine_real_variable clear_registry, 'reg delete \\\"HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Office\\\\12.0\\\\Word\\\\Resili\n\nThese configurations include XOR keys used in the second-stage shellcode, and expiry dates for security products\nsuch as McAfee, Norton, and Bitdefender. Some strings appear to be the attacker's local paths and debugging flag.\n\nNext, the shellcode checks for security solutions by validating the existence of their drivers’ .sys, located under\n_C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers. If security solutions are present, the shellcode compares the current date to an expiry_\ndate configured in the shellcode builder and operates accordingly.\n\nFor instance, in the researched sample, [1] - [7] denote the following values:\n\n\n-----\n\n[1]\nhxxp://mak.logupdates.xyz/DWqYVVzQLc0xrqvt/HG5HlDPqsnr3HBwOKY0vKGRBE7V0sDPdZb09n7xhp0klyT5X.mp3\n\n[2]\nhxxp://mak.logupdates.xyz/DWqYVVzQLc0xrqvt/HG5HlDPqsnr3HBwOKY0vKGRBE7V0sDPdZb09n7xhp0klyT5X.doc\n\n[3] %tmp%\\syswow64.dll\n\n[4] %tmp%\\document.doc\n\n[5] Qoltyfotskelo\n\n[6] schtasks.exe /create /tn wakeup /tr \\\"rundll32 %tmp%\\syswow64.dll, HPMG\\\" /f /sc DAILY /st 11:00 /ri 10 /du 24:00\n\n[7] cmd.exe %tmp%\\\\syswow64.dll\n\nThe malware will execute values depending on whether it finds a security solution. For example, the following table\ndemonstrates the operation performed based on the driver found and the comparison between current date and\nexpiry date:\n\n\n**Driver**\n**Name**\n\n\n**Affiliate** **Expiry**\n**Date**\n\n\n**Sets** **Action 1** **Action 2**\n\n\ngzfit.sys BitDefender\nAntivirus\n\nklif.sys Kaspersky\nAntivirus\n\n\n0x7E6070F\n->\n2022/07/15\n\n0x7E6070B\n->\n2022/07/11\n\n\nif current_date <=\nexpiry: Action1\nelse: Action2\n\nif current_date <=\nexpiry: Action1\nelse: Action2\n\nif current_date <=\nexpiry: Action1\nelse: Action2\n\n\nDownloads from [1] to [3],\n\nmodifies 3 first bytes,\n\nand calls exported function\n\n[5]\n\nInjects shellcode to bcrypt.dll\nshellcode performs the same\nas above\n\nDownloads from [1] to [3],\n\nmodifies 3 first bytes, and\ncalls exported function [5]\n\n\nDownloads from\n\n[1] to [3]\n\nDownloads from\n\n[2] to [4]\n\nExecutes\ncmd.exe, and [7]\nvia WinExec\n\nDownloads from\n\n[1] to [3]\n\nDownloads from\n\n[2] to [4]\n\nExecutes\ncmd.exe, and [7]\nvia WinExec\n\nDownloads from\n\n[1] to [3]\n\nDownloads from\n\n[2] to [4]\n\nand executing\n\n[6] and [7] via\nWinExec\n\n\naswsp.sys Avast 0x7E6070F\n->\n2022/07/15\n\n\n-----\n\nehdrv.sys ESET\nNOD32\nAntivirus\n\nbsfs.sys QuickHeal\nAntivirus\n\n\n0x7E60717\n->\n2022/07/23\n\n0x7E60711\n->\n2022/07/17\n\n\nif current_date <=\nexpiry: Action1\nelse: Action2\n\nif current_date <=\nexpiry: Action1\nelse: Action2\n\nif current_date <=\nexpiry: Action1\nelse: Action2\n\n\nDownloads from [1] to [3],\n\nmodifies 3 first bytes, and\ncalls exported function [5]\n\nDownloads from [1] to [3]\n\nDownloads from [2] to [4]\n\nand executing [6] and [7] via\nWinExec\n\nNothing\n\n\nDownloads from\n\n[1] to [3]\n\ndownloads from\n\n[2] to [4]\n\nand executing\n\n[6] and [7] via\nWinExec\n\nint 3 and exit\n\ndownloads from\n\n[1] to [3]\n\ndownloads from\n\n[2] to [4]\n\nand executing\n\n[6] and [7] via\nWinExec\n\n\n360AvFlt.sys Qihoo360 0x7E60713\n->\n2022/07/19\n\n\n_Security solutions and corresponding actions according to the expiry date_\n\nIf none of the drivers are found on the victim’s machine, the shellcode executes the default routine which downloads\nfrom [1], and modifies the three first bytes back to their original form. This technique is used to evade security\nsolutions and keep them from scanning the executable. It then executes the exported function [5].\n\nMorphisec Labs hasn’t found a clear motive for the included expiry date and driver check. When malware checks for\nsecurity solutions in conjunction with a certain date, it’s often because the authors tested their bypass against the\nlatest version. Future updates would react differently as they’re not tested. Another common malware behavior after\nfinding security solutions is to evade or abort execution. In this case, the malware slightly modifies its behavior but\nmostly continues its malicious activity.\n\n## Module Delivery and Execution\n\nThe initial infection executes the main DLL. This DLL is responsible for beaconing back to the C2 server that the\ninfection was successful, and downloading the next component in the framework. The following figure outlines the\nhigh-level relationships between the components in the rest of the execution:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Component relationships with new/updated components highlighted_\n\n**Main DLL (pgixedfxglmjirdc.dll) Beaconing**\n\nDelivered by the shellcode, the main DLL usually contains two exported functions. In our case, Qoltyfotskelo\n(referred to as the first exported function) and Yolueorgw (referred to as the second exported function).\n\nThe first exported function is responsible for installing persistence and checking for security solutions. Persistence is\nachieved by setting a new Scheduled Task (via COM objects) that runs every three minutes. The action assigned to\nthe task is to run the second exported function—Yolueorgw.\n\nThe second exported function is responsible for beaconing back to the C2 server. Before it does so, it creates a\nmutex to avoid multiple instances running at the same time, and performs VM detection using WMI queries:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Looking for VMware, VMware Virtual Platform, and VirtualBox in csproduct name_\n\nThe malware then uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to collect basic system information such as the\nname, operating system caption, build number, and processor ID:\n\n_Beaconing information sent to the server before encryption_\n\nTo that information, it concatenates the victim’s ID and the folder names under C:\\Program Files and C:\\Program\nFiles (x86) to learn which software is installed on the system. What we refer to as victim ID is a concatenation of\nUsername-ComputerName-ProcessorId. This string identifies the victim in later communication with the C2 server.\n\nOnce this is done the malware can encrypt the victim’s data and beacon back to its C2 server. The malware and\nserver encryption is AES-256 with two sets of embedded keys and IVs. The encrypted data is then encoded using\nBase64.\n\nThe beaconing process is divided into two steps shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Beaconing messages for downloading the next component_\n\nThe first message to the server is sent as a POST request to the first URL path (<first_path>) embedded in the\nbinary. The body contains the following encrypted information:\n\nName: CPU Name>Caption: OS Version>Build: Build Number V:|||Username-ComputerNameProcessorId||||||O|||3|||Folder #1 Name?Folder #2 Name…\n\nDepending on the server’s response, the malware will either stay idle and keep the beaconing loop, or download the\nnext stage. If the latter, the malware sends another POST request to a second URL path (<second_path>) on the\nsame server. This message contains the following encrypted information: Username-ComputerNameProcessorId|||Next stage DLL name\n\nThe response to that request is the next stage DLL. To execute the next stage, the malware creates another\nscheduled task and removes the previous one using a clean up .bat file (see ms.bat in the Appendix section).\n\n**Module Downloader (WavemsMp.dll)**\n\nThe main purpose of this stage is to download and execute the modules used to steal the user’s information. To\nunderstand which modules are used in the current infection, the malware communicates with another C2 server. The\nmalware fetches the new address from an embedded link that refers to a Google Drive document containing the\nencrypted address:\n\n_Download the encrypted C2 server address from Google Drive_\n\n_Decryption of the C2 address downloaded from Google Drive_\n\nThis architecture allows the authors to frequently update their C2 servers without needing to redeliver the binary. After\nthe C2 server address is decrypted, the malware sends a POST request to it with the encrypted victim’s ID in the\nrequest body. The response is the modules’ configuration:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis framework s modularity stands out. The configuration controls which modules to download and execute without\nneeding to update the binary. Morphisec Labs witnessed how this functionality came into play when a single binary\ncommunicated with different C2 servers and downloaded different modules across multiple runs over time.\n\nThe response specifies information about the modules, delimited by | (pipeline) where each part has the following\nformat:\n\nModule name>Module size>Should download?>Export name to execute>Additional parameters\n\nAdditionally, there are special characters the malware looks for such as:\n\nT?<file_name>?<file_data>—creates a file at %Temp%\\usdata and writes the content\nM?<module_name>?<module_size>—downloads another file from the server to %ProgramData%\\MJDpnd\nD?—unknown\n\nThe following figure illustrates the various modules and the interactions between them:\n\nieflagKlo.dll—Keylogger module\nieflagUl.dll—File uploader module which uploads the modules’ output\nieflagSp.dll—Screenshot module\nieflagTr.dll—File collection module\nieflagUsd.dll—Removable disk file collection module\nieflagBr.dll—Browser information stealer module\nieflagRvso.dll—Reverse shell module\n\n[For more information about each module, refer to this analysis.](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUyMjk4NzExMA==&mid=2247486186&idx=1&sn=efafc115ec7c9e8f589725de2c73cf69)\n\n## Upgraded Browser Stealer Module\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile Morphisec Labs was researching the previously known modules, one module caught our attention the\nbrowser stealer. The browser stealer was first introduced to the framework in late 2020 and since then, we haven’t\nseen any significant changes. Until now.\n\nInstead of implementing the stealing functionality inside the DLL, the module uses four additional executables\ndownloaded by the previous stage (WavemsMp.dll). Each additional executable steals information from Google\nChrome and/or Mozilla Firefox. The following table summarizes what data is stolen from each browser:\n\n**Name** **Stolen Data** **Plain text file** **Encrypted file**\n\n\nWinBroGogle.exe Google Chrome\ncredentials\n\nWinBroGoMoH.exe Google Chrome and\nMozilla Firefox History\n\nWinBroMozla32.exe Firefox login (profile\ndata)\n\nWinBroMozla64.exe Firefox login (profile\ndata)\n\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\ucredgogle_qrty %base%\\usagoglyse.rnm\n\n\n1. %base%\\goo_bhf.txt\n\n2. %base%\\maza_bhf.txt\n\n\n1. %base%\\goo_bhf.rnm\n\n2.\n%base%\\maza_bhf.rnm\n\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\usam0zlp_xcertyuqas %base%\\usam0zlp.rnm\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\usam0zlp_xcertyuqas %base%\\usam0zlp.rnm\n\n\n_Stolen data by each executable (%base% = C:\\ProgramData\\DeviceStage\\usabrowatad)_\n\nThe browser module executes each executable; they steal the data and store it in a temporary plain text file. The file\nis then encrypted and saved as an .rnm file which is later sent back to the C2 server by the file upload module\nieflagUl.dll.\n\n## Reverse shell DLL implementation\n\nSo far the reverse shell module has been implemented as an executable file. But now the actor aligns with the rest of\nthe modules and recompiles the reverse shell as a DLL. The functionality remains the same, opening a socket to the\nattacker’s machine (located at 162.33.177[.]41), creating a new hidden cmd.exe process and setting the STDIN,\nSTDOUT and STDERR as the socket.\n\nThe shell runs until the actor sends the string “exit\\n”.\n\n## Defending Against Threats Like APT-C-35\n\n\n-----\n\nDefending against APTs like the DoNot team requires a Defense in Depth strategy that uses multiple layers of\nsecurity to ensure redundancy if any given layers are breached. Any sufficiently large organization is at risk of being\nattacked by an APT group such as the DoNot team. And these groups target a crucial security gap that few\norganizations have plugged. This gap exists between attack surface reduction strategies—such as patching security\nupdates, hardening networks, firewalls, and web applications firewalls; and technologies such as data security tools,\nand NGAV, EDR, EPP, and XDR etc., which focus on detecting anomalies on the disc or in the operating system.\nThat gap is the runtime environment in memory.\n\nThe hardest attacks to defend against are those that—like the Windows framework detailed here—target applications\nat runtime. This is because popular security solutions such as NGAV, EDR, EPP, XDR etc. focus on detecting\nanomalies on the disc or operating system. Their ability to detect or block attacks in memory at runtime are limited. To\nthe extent they can do so, they cause major system performance issues and false alerts because they must be dialed\nto their most aggressive alert settings.\n\nHowever, a unique technology named Moving Target Defense (MTD) is purpose built to defend against advanced,\nruntime attacks against Windows and Linux without affecting system performance or generating false alerts. It\n[proactively stops supply chain attacks, code injection, defense evasion, remote code execution, privilege escalation,](https://blog.morphisec.com/supply-chain-attack-mitigation)\ncredential theft, and ransomware. And it does so without needing signatures or behavior models. How? By\nrandomizing trusted runtime application code so no two machines look the same, and even a single system changes\nover time. While trusted applications can navigate the modified runtime environment, MTD blocks any software\ncomponent oblivious to the traps left behind. And it does this without any noticeable impact on system performance.\nTo learn more about this revolutionary technology, read the free white paper—The Ultimate Ransomware Strategy:\n_Zero Trust + Moving Target Defense._\n\n## Appendix\n\n### ms.bat\n\n\n-----\n\necho off\n\nSETLOCAL\n\nset id=%1\n\nset pat=%2\n\nset t_sk=%3\n\nset t_sk_self=%4\n\nset extra_lld=%5\n\n_::echo %id%_\n\n_::echo %pat%_\n\nschtasks /delete /tn %t_sk_self% /f\n\ntaskkill /F /PID %id% /T\n\ntimeout /t 2\n\ntaskkill /PID %id% /T /F\n\ntimeout /t 2\n\nschtasks /delete /tn %t_sk% /f\n\ntimeout /t 2\n\nschtasks /delete /tn %t_sk_self% /f\n\ntimeout /t 2\n\nschtasks /delete /tn %t_sk_self% /f\n\ntimeout /t 2\n\ndel %pat%\n\n_:: del batch file self_\n\ntimeout /t 2\n\ndel \"%~f0\" & EXIT\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nBlog Sample\n\n486f772d81a3b90ba76617fd5f49d9ca99dac1051a9918222cfa25117888a1d5\n\nDocs\n\n\n-----\n\nd566680ca3724ce242d009e5a46747c4336c0d3515ad11bede5fd9c95cf6b4ce\n\n28c71461ac5cf56d4dd63ed4a6bc185a54f28b2ea677eee5251a5cdad07077b8\n\n9761bae130d40280a495793fd639b2cb9d8c28ad7ac3a8f10546eb3d2fc3eefc\n\n41c221c4f14a5f93039de577d0a76e918c915862986a8b9870df1c679469895c\n\nComponents (DLLs and EXEs)\n\n2c84b325b8dc5554f216cb6a0663c8ff5d725b2f26a5e692f7b3997754c98d4d\n\na70038cdf5aea822d3560471151ce8f8bacd259655320dea77d48ccfa5b5af4f\n\nd3a05cb5b4ae4454079e1b0a8615c449b01ad65c5c3ecf56b563b10a38ecfdef\n\nd71fa80d71b2c68c521ed22ffb21a2cff12839348af6b217d9d2156adb00e550\n\n7fc0e9c47c02835ecbbb63e209287be215656d82b868685a61201f8212d083d9\n\n6e7b6cc2dd3ae311061fefa151dbb07d8e8a305aed00fa591d5b1cce43b9b0de\n\n90cb497cad8537da3c02be7e8d277d29b78b53f78d13c797a9cd1e733724cf78\n\n93ca5ec47baeb7884c05956ff52d28afe6ac49e7aba2964e0e6f2514d7942ef8\n\n9b2ef052657350f5c67f999947cf8cd6d06a685875c31e70d7178ffb396b5b96\n\n80f2f4b6b1f06cf8de794a8d6be7b421ec1d4aeb71d03cccfc4b3dfd1b037993\n\nf0c1794711f3090deb2e87d8542f7c683d45dc41e4087c99ce3dca4b28a9e6f6\n\n5ebee134afe192cdc7fc5cc9f83b8273b6f282a6a382c709f2a21d26f532b2d3\n\nDomains\n\nworldpro[.]buzz\n\nser.dermlogged[.]xyz\n\ndoctorstrange[.]buzz\n\nclipboardgames[.]xyz\n\nbeetelson[.]xyz\n\ntobaccosafe[.]xyz\n\nkotlinn[.]xyz\n\nfitnesscheck[.]xyz\n\ndayspringdesk[.]xyz\n\nsrvrfontsdrive[.]xyz\n\nglobalseasurfer[.]xyz\n\nesr.suppservices[.]xyz\n\n[Contact SalesInquire via Azure](mailto:sales@morphisec.com)\n\n\n-----",
