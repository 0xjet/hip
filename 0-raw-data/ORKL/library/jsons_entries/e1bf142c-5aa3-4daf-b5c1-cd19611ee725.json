In Q4 2021, Avast observed an increase in Chaes’\n\n```\nactivities, with infection attempts detected from more than `66,605 of our` `Brazilian`\ncustomers. In our investigation, we found the malware is distributed through many\ncompromised websites, including highly credible sites. Overall, Avast has found Chaes’\nartifacts in `800+ websites. More than` `700 of them contain Brazilian TLDs. All`\ncompromised websites are `WordPress sites, which leads us to speculate that the attack`\nvector could be exploitation of vulnerabilities in `WordPress CMS . However, we are unable`\nto perform forensics to confirm this theory. We immediately shared our findings with the\n```\nBrazilian CERT (BR Cert) with the hope of preventing Chaes from spreading. By the time\n\n```\nof this publication, Chaes’ artifacts still remain on some of the websites we observed.\n\nChaes is characterized by the multiple-stage delivery that utilizes scripting frameworks such\nas `JScript,` `Python, and` `NodeJS, binaries written in` `Delphi, and malicious` `Google`\n```\nChrome extensions . The ultimate goal of Chaes is to steal credentials stored in Chrome\n\n```\nand intercept logins of popular banking websites in `Brazil .`\n\nIn this posting, we present the results of our analysis of the Chaes samples we found in `Q4`\n```\n2021 . Future updates on the latest campaign will be shared via Twitter or a later post.\n\n## Infection Scheme\n\n```\nWhen someone reaches a website compromised by Chaes, they are presented with the\nbelow pop-up asking users to install the `Java Runtime application:`\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the user follows the instructions, they will download a malicious installer that poses as a\nlegitimate `Java Installer . As shown below, the fake installer closely imitates the`\nlegitimate `Brazilian Portuguese Java installer in terms of appearance and behavior.`\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the installation begins, the user’s system is compromised. After a few minutes, all web\ncredentials, history, user profiles stored by Chrome will be sent to attackers. Users may\nexperience Google Chrome getting closed and restarted automatically. This indicates any\nfuture interactions with the following Brazilian banking websites will be monitored and\nintercepted:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nmercadobitcoin.com.br\n\n```\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Infected websites\n\nUpon inspecting the HTML code of the compromised websites, we found the malicious script\ninserted as shown below:\n\nIn this case, the `V=28` likely represents the version number. We also found a URL with\nother versions as well:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe script creates an HTML element that stays on top of the page with Java Runtime\nDownload” lure. This element references an image from a suspicious URL\n```\n   https://sys-dmt[.]net/index.php?D\\\n   https://dmt-sys[.]net/\n\n```\nand an on-click download of a `Microsoft Installer from`\n```\n   https://bkwot3kuf[.]com/wL38HvYBiOl/index.php?get or\n   https://f84f305c[.]com/aL39HvYB4/index.php?get or\n   https://dragaobrasileiro[.]com.br/wp-content/themes/getCorsFile.php\n\n### Microsoft Installer\n\n```\nThe flowchart below shows the infection chain following the malicious installer execution.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nInside the MSI package\n\nThe installer contains 3 malicious JS files `install.js,` `sched.js, and` `sucesso.js`\nrenamed to `Binary._ as shown above. Each of them handles a different task, but all are`\ncapable of reporting the progress to the specified `CnC :`\n\n\n-----\n\nImplementation of the logging function across all 3 scripts\n\n**install.js**\n\nThe purpose of this script is to download and execute a setup script called `runScript` that\nwill prepare the proper `Python environment for the next stage loader. After making an`\nHTTP request to a hardcoded domain, the obfuscated `runScript` is downloaded and then\nexecuted to perform the following tasks:\n\nCheck for Internet connection (using `google.com )`\nCreate %APPDATA%\\\\<pseudo-random folder name>\\\\extensions folder\nDownload password-protected archives such as `python32.rar/python64.rar and`\n```\n   unrar.exe to that extensions folder\n\n```\nWrite the path of the newly created extensions folder to\n```\n   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Software\\\\Python\\\\Config\\\\Path\n\n```\nPerforms some basic system profiling\nExecute `unrar.exe command with the password specified as an argument to`\nunpack `python32.rar/python64.rar`\nConnect to `C2 and download 32bit and 64bit` `__init__.py scripts along with 2`\nencrypted payloads. Each payload has a pseudo-random name.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrunScript.js content\n\n```\n**sched.js**\n\nThe purpose of this script is to set up persistence and guarantee the execution\nof __init__.py downloaded by `runScript` from the previous step. `Sched.js`\naccomplishes this by creating a `Scheduled Task as its primary means and creating a`\n```\nStartup link as its backup means. Ultimately, they are both able to maintain the after\n```\nreboot execution of the following command:\n```\n ...\\\\<python32|python64>\\\\pythonw.exe __init__.py /m\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nScheduledTask Configuration\n\n**sucesso.js**\n\nThis script reports to `CnC that the initial installation on the victim’s computer has succeeded`\nand is ready for the next stage\n\n### Python Loader Chain\n\nThe `Scheduled Task created by` `sched.js` eventually starts `__init__.py`\nwhichinitiates the `Python in-memory loading chain. The loading chain involves many`\nlayers of Python scripts, JS scripts, shellcode, Delphi DLLs, and .NET PE which we will\nbreak down in this section. Impressively, the final payload is executed within `__init__.py`\nprocess ( PID 2416 and `4160 ) as shown below:`\n\n\n-----\n\n**__init__.py**\n\n\n-----\n\nObfuscated content\nThe `__init__.py` xor decrypts and decompresses the pseudo-random filename\ndownloaded by `runScript.js into another Python script. The new Python script contains`\n2 embedded payloads: `image and` `shellcode in encrypted form. Image represents the`\nChaes loader module called `chaes_vy.dll while` `shellcode is an in-memory PE loader.`\nWe found this particular loader shellcode reappearing many times in the later stages of\nChaes. Running the shellcode using `CreateThread API with proper parameters pointing to`\n```\nchaes_vy.dll, the Python script eventually loads chaes_vy.dll into memory:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nchaes_vy.dll is loaded into memory by an embedded shellcode\n\n**Chaes_vy.dll**\n\nChaes_vy is a `Delphi module that loads an embedded` `.NET executable that in turn`\nruns 2 `JavaScripts :` `script.js and` `engine.js . These two scripts hold the core`\nfunctionalities of the Chaes_vy module.\n\n\n-----\n\n**script.js**\n\nThis script acts as the interface between .NET framework and JScript framework, providing\nthe necessary utilities to execute any scripts and modules that `engine.js` downloads in\nthe future. By default, `script.js` will try to retrieve the paths to payloads specified in the\nargument of `__init__.py . If nothing is found it will execute` `engine.js`\n\n**engine.js**\n\nThis script employs 2 methods of retrieving a JS payload: `getBSCode() and`\n```\ngetDWCode() both are called every 6 minutes.\nGetBSCode is the primary method, also the only one we are able to observe serving\n\n```\npayload. The encrypted payload is hidden as commented-out code inside the HTML page of\na Blogspot which is shown below. Without being infected by Chaes, this site is completely\nharmless.\n\nView of the Blogpost page contains hidden malicious code\nOn the other hand, when executed, `engine.js will parse the string starting from <div`\nid=\\”rss-feed\\”> which is the marker of the encrypted payload:\n\n\n-----\n\nHidden code\nAfter decrypting this text using `AES with a hardcoded key,` `instructions.js` is retrieved\nand executed. This script is in charge of downloading and executing Chaes’ malicious\nChrome “extensions”. More info about `instructions.js is provided in the next section.`\n```\ngetDWCode is the secondary method of retrieving instruction.js . It employs a DGA\n\n```\napproach to find an active domain weekly when `getBSCode fails. Since we are not able to`\nobserve this method being used successfully in the wild, we have no analysis to present\n[here. However, you can check out the full algorithm posted on our Github.](https://github.com/avast/ioc/tree/master/Chaes/extras/DGA.js)\n\n**Instructions.js**\n```\nInstructions.js is the last stage of the delivery chain. Nothing up to this point has\n\n```\ngained the attacker any true benefits. It is the job of instructions.js to download and\ninstall all the malicious extensions that will take advantage of the Chrome browser and harm\nthe infected users. The address of all payloads are hardcoded as shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe extensions are separated into password-protected archives vs encrypted binaries. The\nnon-compressed payloads are PE files that can be run independently while compressed\nones add necessary NodeJS packages for the extension to run. Below is the example of\n```\nchremows63_64 archive contents:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nAll the binaries with `dll_filename argument such as` `chromeows2.bin are encrypted,`\nincluding the ones inside the RAR archive. The decryption algorithm is located inside\n```\nscript.js as we mentioned in the previous section. To decrypt and run each binary,\n\n```\nChaes needs to call `__init__.py with the file path specified as an argument.`\n\nThe extension installation can be simplified into the following steps:\n\nAn HTTP Request ( aws/isChremoReset.php ) is sent to check if Google Chrome\nfrom a particular `uid has been hooked. If not, Chrome and NodeJS will be closed.`\nMore information about `uid in the “Online” section below.`\nThe download request is constructed based on 3 scenarios: 32bit, 64bit, and no\nGoogle Chrome found. Each scenario will contain suitable versions of the extensions\nand their download links.\nThe extension is downloaded. The compressed payload will be unpacked properly.\nA `hosts file is created for the newly downloaded module. Inside the file is the CnC`\nrandomly picked from the following pool:\n\nEach extension will use the address specified in `hosts for CnC communication`\n\nLaunch each extension through `python.exe __init__.py with proper arguments as`\nshown below\n\n\n-----\n\n### Extensions\n\n**Online**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nonline.dll is a short-lived Delphi module that is executed by instruction.js\n\n```\nbefore other modules are deployed. Its main purpose is to fingerprint the victim by\ngenerating a `uid which is a concatenation of drive` `C: VolumeSerialNumber,`\n```\nUserName, and Computername . The uid is written to a register key\n\n```\n`SOFTWARE\\\\Python\\\\Config\\uid` before being included inside the beaconing message.\n\nThis registry key is also where `instruction.js previouslygets the` `uid asking CnC if the`\nvictim’s Chrome has been hooked. The first time `instruction.js gets launched this`\nregistry has not been created yet, therefore the Chrome process is always killed.\n```\nOnline.dll retrieves the CnC server specified in the hosts file and performs the\n\n```\nbeaconing request `/aws/newClient.php, sending the victim’s` `uid and basic system`\ninformation.\n\n**Mtps4 (MultiTela Pascal)**\n\nModule `mtps4 is a backdoor written in` `Delphi . Its main purpose is to connect to` `CnC`\nand wait for a responding `PascalScript to execute. Similar to the previous module, CnC`\nis retrieved from the `hosts file.` `Mtps4 sends a` `POST request to the server with a`\nhardcoded `User-Agent containing` `uid and command type. It currently supports 2`\ncommands: `start and` `reset . If the` `reset command is responded with ‘ (* SCRIPT`\n```\nOK *) ’, it will terminate the process.\nStart command is a bit more interesting.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nExample of an HTTP request with “start” command\nAs a reply to this command, it expects to receive a `PascalScript code containing a`\ncomment ‘ (* SCRIPT OK * )’.\n```\nmtps4 is compiled with https://github.com/remobjects/pascalscript to support PascalScript.\n\n```\nBefore running, the script they create a window that copies the screen and covers the entire\ndesktop to avoid raising suspicion when performing malicious tasks on the system.\n\nUnfortunately during the investigation, we couldn’t get hold of the actual script from the CnC.\n\n**Chrolog (ChromeLog)**\n\n`Chrolog` is a Google Chrome Password Stealer written in Delphi. Although it is listed as\nan extension, `Chrolog is an independent tool that extracts user personal data out of the`\nChrome database and exfiltrates them through HTTP. The CnC server is also retrieved from\nthe `hosts file previously created by` `instruction.js .`\n\n**HTTP Request** **Data Exfiltration**\n\n/aws/newUpload.php **Cookies, Web Data, and Login Data (encrypted)**\n\n\n-----\n\n/aws/newMasterKey.php Chrome Master Key used to decrypt Login Data\n\n/aws/newProfileImage.php Profile Image URL collected from\n_last_downloaded_gaia_picture_url_with_size attribute_\ninside Local State\n\n/aws/newPersonalData.php Username, fullname, gaia_name\n\n/aws/bulkNewLogin.php All Login Data is decrypted and added to local.sql\ndatabase. Then the corresponding section of the\ndatabase is exfiltrated\n\n/aws/bulkNewUrl.php **History is added to local.sql database. Then the**\ncorresponding section of the database is exfiltrated\n\n/aws/bulkNewAdditionalData.php **Web Data is written to local.sql database. Then the**\ncorresponding section of the database is exfiltrated\n\n/aws/bulkNewProcess.php All running processes are collected and written to\n**local.sql database. Then the corresponding section of**\nthe database is exfiltrated\n\n(Cookies, Web Data, Login Data, History, and Local State is standardly located\nat%APPDATA%\\\\Local\\\\Google\\\\Chrome\\\\User Data\\\\Default\\\\)\n\n**Chronodx (Chrome Noder)**\n\nchrolog.rar contains NodeJS packages and chronodx.bin aka Chronod2.dll.\n\n\n-----\n\nChronodx dependency (“name”: “chremows” is indeed how it is defined)\nThe `chronodx extension package can be separated into 2 parts: a loader called`\n```\nChronod2.dll and a JavaScript banking trojan called index_chronodx2.js . First,\nChronod2.dll performs an HTTP request /dsa/chronod/index_chronodx2.js to retrieve\nindex_chronodx2.js . If successful, Chronod2.dll will run silently in the background\n\n```\nuntil it detects the Chrome browser opened by the user. When that happens, it will close the\nbrowser and reopen its own instance of Chrome along with `index_chronodx2.js being run`\nfrom the `node.exe process.`\n\nChronodx in idle mode\n\nChronodx reopens Chrome and executes “node.exe index.js” command\n\n\n-----\n\nIndex.js is index_chronodx2.jsin this case\n```\nIndex_chronodx2.js utilizes puppeteer-core, a NodeJS framework that provides APIs to\n\n```\ncontrol Chrome browser, for malicious purposes. `Index_chronodx2.js implements many`\nfeatures to intercept popular banking websites in Brazil including\n```\n   bancobrasil.com.br/aapf\n   bancodobrasil.com.br/aapf\n   bb.com.br/aapf\n   mercadopago.com/…/card_tokens/\n   mercadopago.com/enter-pass/\n   mercadolivre.com/enter-pass/\n   lojaintegrada.com.br/public/login/\n   mercadobitcoin.com.br\n\n```\nUpon visiting any of the above websites, index_chronodx2.js will start collecting the victim’s\nbanking info and send it to the attacker through a set of HTTP commands. The CnC server\nis stored in the `hosts file, but when it is not found in the system, a hardcoded backup CnC`\nwill be used instead:\n\n**C2 Command** **Meaning**\n\n/aws/newQRMPClient.php Supposedly sending user info to the attacker when a QR\ncode scan is found on banking websites listed above, but\nthis feature is currently commented out\n\n/aws/newContaBBPF.php Sending user banking info when Bancodobrasil banking\nsites are intercepted\n\n/aws/newContaCef.php Sending user banking info when Caixa banking sites are\nintercepted\n\n\n-----\n\n/aws/newCaixaAcesso.php Telling the attacker that a victim has accessed Caixa\nbanking page\n\naws/newMercadoCartao.php Sending user banking info when Mercado banking sites are\nintercepted\n\n/aws/newExtraLogin.php Send user credentials when logging in to one of the listed\npages\n\n**Chremows (Chrome WebSocket)**\n```\nChremows is another extension that uses NodeJS and puppeteer-core, and is similar to the\n\n```\n[functionality of node.js mentioned in the Cybereason 2020 report.](https://www.cybereason.com/hubfs/dam/collateral/reports/11-2020-Chaes-e-commerce-malware-research.pdf) `Chremows targets two`\nplatforms Mercado Livre (mercadolivre.com.br) and Mercado Pago (mercadopago.com.br)\nboth belong to an online marketplace company called Mercado Libre, Inc.\n\nChremows dependency\nSharing the same structure of chronodx module, `chremows contains a loader,`\n```\nCreateChrome64.dll that downloads a JavaScript-based banking trojan called\nindex.js . CreateChrome64.dll will automatically update index.js when a newer\n\n```\nversion is found. Unlike chronodx, `chremows executes` `index.js immediately after`\ndownload and doesn’t require Google Chrome to be opened. In a separate thread,\n```\nCreateChrome64.dll loads an embedded module ModHooksCreateWindow64.dll that\n\n```\n[Cybereason has analyzed in their 2020 report. Overall, this module help increase the](https://www.cybereason.com/hubfs/dam/collateral/reports/11-2020-Chaes-e-commerce-malware-research.pdf)\ncapabilities that `chremows has on Google Chrome, allowing the attacker to perform “active”`\ntasks such as sending keypresses/mouse clicks to Chrome, or opening designated pages.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, `CreateChrome64.dll copies Chrome s Local State file to the same location of`\n```\nindex.js with the name local.json. Index.js uses local.json to help the attacker identify\n\n```\nthe victim.\n\nHardcoded CnC\n```\nIndex.js employs two methods of communicating with the attacker: through WebSocket\n\n```\nand through HTTP. Each method has its own set of C2 servers as shown in the above\npicture. WebSocket is used to receive commands and send client-related messages. On the\nother hand, HTTP is for exfiltrating financial data such as banking credentials and account\ninformation to the attacker.\n\nList of known `Index.js WebSocket commands`\n\n**Command from C2** **Functionality**\n\n\n-----\n\n`command::` Send command such as keystroke, mouseclick\n\n`openbrowser::` Open Chrome window with minimal size to stay hidden\n\nIf the user stays connected to the WebSocket C2 server, every six minutes it automatically\ngoes to the targeted Mercado Pago and Mercado Livre pages and performs malicious tasks.\nDuring this routine, the attacker loses direct control of the browser. The target pages are\nbanking, credit, and merchant pages that require users’ login. If the user has not logged out\nof these pages, the attacker will start to collect data and exfiltrate them through the following\nHTTP requests:\n```\n   /aws/newMercadoCredito.php\n   /aws/newMercadoPago.php\n\n```\nIf the user is not logged in to those pages but has the password saved in Chrome, after the\nroutine ends, the attackers will get back their direct control of Chrome and log in manually.\n\n## Summary\n\nChaes exploits many websites containing CMS WordPress to serve malicious installers.\nAmong them, there are a few notable websites for which we tried our best to notify BR Cert.\nThe malicious installer communicates with remote servers to download the Python\nframework and malicious Python scripts which initiate the next stage of the infection chain. In\nthe final stage, malicious Google Chrome extensions are downloaded to disk and loaded\nwithin the Python process. The Google Chrome extensions are able to steal users’\ncredentials stored in Chrome and collect users’ banking information from popular banking\nwebsites.\n\n## IOCs\n\n[The full list of IoCs is
