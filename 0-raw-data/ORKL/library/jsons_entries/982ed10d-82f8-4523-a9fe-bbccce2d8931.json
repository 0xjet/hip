    "plain_text": "# Pro-Palestinian Hacking Group Compromises Berghof PLCs in Israel\n\n**[otorio.com/blog/pro-palestinian-hacking-group-compromises-berghof-plcs-in-israel/](https://www.otorio.com/blog/pro-palestinian-hacking-group-compromises-berghof-plcs-in-israel/)**\n\n_By David Krivobokov, Research Team Leader_\n\n## Overview: Berghof PLCs being compromised\n\nOn September, 4th, 2022, a hacktivist group “GhostSec” that was previously observed\ntargeting Israeli organizations and platforms, announced on social media and its Telegram\nchannel that the group successfully breached 55 Berghof PLC devices in Israel.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the message it published, GhostSec attached a video demonstrating a successful log-in\nto the PLC’s admin panel, together with an image of an HMI screen showing its current\nstate and control of the PLC process, and another image showing that the PLC had been\nstopped. In the following message (inset) the group published the dumped data from the\nbreached PLCs.\n\n\n-----\n\nOTORIO s Research group decided to further investigate the details of this incident with the\ngoal of understanding how “GhostSec” was able to gain control over these PLCs and\nassess the underlying risks.\n\n## Diving Into The Breach’s Artifacts\n\nObserving the published system dump of ZIP archives (part_1.zip and part_2.zip) revealed\nthe public IP addresses (below) of the affected PLCs. This suggests that the devices\nwere/are publicly exposed to the internet.\n\nBoth archives contained the same types of data – system dumps and HMI screenshots,\nwhich were exported directly from the Berghof admin panel. The panel has this functionality\nby design, allowing logged-in users to create a backup and see the current HMI state via a\nscreenshot.\n\n## How were the Berghof PLCs Breached?\n\nAt the time of our investigation, the IPs were still accessible through the Internet. Access to\nthe admin panel is password-protected. However, trying a few default and common\ncredentials resulted in a successful login.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe HMI screenshots can be taken and viewed simply by accessing the “Screenshot” tab:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe system dumps were similarly done by just accessing the “System Dump” tab in the\nadmin panel:\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough access to the admin panel provides full control over some of the PLC’s\nfunctionality, it does not provide direct control over the industrial process. It is possible to\naffect the process to some extent, but the actual process configuration itself isn’t available\nsolely from the admin panel.\n\n**Does GhostSec have OT Capabilities?**\n\nFrom our research, we concluded that Berghof uses CODESYS technology as its HMI, and\nis also accessible via the browser at a certain address. From our observations of\nGhostSec’s proofs of breach, we did not know whether GhostSec gained access to the\nHMI. But we’ve confirmed that the HMI screen was also publicly available.\n\nThe HMI exposes the configuration of the industrial process:\n\n\n-----\n\n## With Shodan Anyone Can Be a Hacker\n\nCommunication in industrial networks is maintained over dedicated industrial protocols.\nLooking at the scanning results in the Shodan, search engine for Internet-connected\ndevices shows that this PLC has few open ports:\n\n80 - HTTP\n8080 - HTTP\n\n502 – Modbus\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the HTTP ports provide access to web services, Modbus is the industrial protocol.\nModbus allows transferring data between the PLC to the HMI/SCADA systems, as well as\nprobing and changing its values.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnlike cyber attacks on IT infrastructure, OT security breaches can be extremely dangerous\nsince they can affect physical processes and, in some cases, even lead to life-threatening\nsituations.\n\nWhile GhostSec’s claims are of a sophisticated cyber attack, the incident reviewed here is\nsimply an unfortunate case where easily overlooked misconfigurations of industrial systems\nled to an extremely unsophisticated attempt to breach the systems themselves.\n\nThe fact that the HMI probably wasn’t accessed, nor manipulated by GhostSec, and the\nhackers were not exploiting the Modbus interface, shows an unfamiliarity with the OT\ndomain. To the best of our knowledge, GhostSec hadn’t brought critical damage to the\naffected systems, but only sought to draw attention to the hacktivist group and its activities.\n\nDespite the low impact of this incident, this is a great example where a cyber attack could\nhave easily been avoided by simple, proper configuration. Disabling the public exposure of\nassets to the Internet, and maintaining a good password policy, especially changing the\ndefault login credentials, would cause the hacktivists’ breach attempt to fail.\nOTORIO\"s **[reconOT helps critical infrastructure companies and industrial manufacturers](https://www.otorio.com/resources/otorio-reconot/)**\nprevent these kinds of breaches, whether of Berghof PLCs or those from other\nmanufacturers. It does so via automatic, OT-centric reconnaissance to discover a\ncompany's assets as they are seen by a potential attacker.\n\nTo learn more, **[contact OTORIO's OT security professionals.](https://go.otorio.com/contact-us)**\n\n\n-----",
