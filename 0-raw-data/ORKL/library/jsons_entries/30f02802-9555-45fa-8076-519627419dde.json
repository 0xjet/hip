We used this code name\nbased on its description – “Brazilian RAT Android”. It exclusively targets victims in Brazil:\nhowever, theoretically it could also be used to attack any other Android user if the\ncybercriminals behind it want to. It has been widespread since January 2019, primarily\nhosted in the Google Play store, but also found in alternative unofficial Android app stores.\nFor the malware to function correctly, it requires at least Android Lollipop 5.0 version.\n\nThe cybercriminals behind BRATA use few infection vectors. For example, they use push\nnotifications on compromised websites; and also spread it using messages delivered via\nWhatsApp or SMS, and sponsored links in Google searches.\n\nThe first samples we found in the wild date to January and February 2019, while so far over\n20 different variants have appeared in the Google Play Store, the majority of these pose as\nan update to the popular instant messaging application WhatsApp. The CVE-2019-3568\nWhatsApp patch is one of the topics abused by BRATA threat actor. Once a victim’s device is\ninfected, “BRATA” enables its keylogging feature, enhancing it with real-time streaming\nfunctionality. It uses Android’s Accessibility Service feature to interact with other applications\ninstalled on the user’s device.\n\n\n-----\n\n**COMMAND** **DESCRIPTION**\n\n\nStart/Stop\nStreaming\n\nTurn Off/Fake\nTurn Off\n\nDevice\nInformation\n\nRequest\nUnlock/Unlock\nDevice\n\n\nCapture and send user’s screen output in real-time.\n\nCan be used to turn off the screen or give the user the impression that\nthe screen is off while performing actions in the background.\n\nRetrieves Android system information, logged user and their registered\nGoogle accounts, but missing permissions to properly execute the\nmalware, and hardware information.\n\nRequest the user to unlock the device or perform a remote unlock.\n\n\nStart Activity Launch any application installed with a set of parameters sent via a\nJSON data file.\n\nSend Text Send a string of text to input data in textboxes.\n\nLaunch/Uninstall Launch any particular application or uninstall the malware and remove\ntraces of infection.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the infamous fake WhatsApp update registered over 10,000\ndownloads in the official Google Play Store, reaching up to 500 victims per day.\n\nKaspersky products detect this family as “HEUR:Backdoor.AndroidOS.Brata”\n\nIn general, we always recommend carefully review permissions any app is requesting on the\ndevice. It is also essential to install an excellent up-to-date anti-malware solution with realtime protection enabled.\n\n\n-----\n\nReference md5 hashes:\n\n1d8cf2c9c12bf82bf3618becfec34ff7\n4203e31024d009c55cb8b1d7a4e28064\n4b99fb9de0e31004525f99c8a8ea6e46\n\nTo get a complete list of IoCs along with YARA rules, please visit Kaspersky Threat\n[Intelligence Portal https://tip.kaspersky.com/](https://tip.kaspersky.com/)\n\n[Brazil](https://securelist.com/tag/brazil/)\n[Google Android](https://securelist.com/tag/google-android/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Mobile Malware](https://securelist.com/tag/mobile-malware/)\n[RAT Trojan](https://securelist.com/tag/rat-trojan/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nFully equipped Spying Android RAT from Brazil: BRATA\n\nYour email address will not be published.
