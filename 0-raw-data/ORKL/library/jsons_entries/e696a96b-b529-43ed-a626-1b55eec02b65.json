The interview has been lightly edited for\ngrammar.\n\n**The Record: French police made headlines last month after its partnership with**\n**Ukrainian police resulted in the arrest of several suspects believed to be involved with**\n**the Egregor ransomware cartel. Without revealing sensitive details about the ongoing**\n**case, can you tell us what led to your decision to target this specific group?**\n\n**François B.: We do not share operational MO, but let’s say our Ukrainian partners and us**\nhad pieces that added up.\n\n**TR: Two security firms told The Record that following the arrests, they had not seen**\n**any new cases of Egregor attacks. Do you believe that you arrested the main culprits**\n**who operated the service?**\n\n**FB: A little bit of both. One of them seemed to be deeply involved with the main actor and**\nhad access to the most critical resources. The other two were providing support (privilege\nescalation, for instance).\n\n**TR: Will we see new cases spawning from the Egregor arrest? Have you and your**\n**Ukrainian partners been able to retrieve more data about other Egregor affiliates?**\n\n**FB: Investigation is still ongoing.**\n\n**TR: Despite ransomware attacks being such a huge issue for both the public and**\n**private sector, until now, only members of the Netwalker and Egregor gangs have**\n**been arrested. Why do you think law enforcement, in general, is having such a hard**\n**time tracking down ransomware gangs, as opposed to other forms of cybercrime?**\n\n**FB: Ransomware infrastructure is often elaborate and extensive. When you add the**\njudiciary’s complexity, the investigation is not as fast and reactive for investigators as for\nperps.\n\n**TR: In your role as Head of the Cyberintelligence Division at CSIRT-PJ, what is the**\n**typical process in tracking down suspects of cybercrime offenses?**\n\n\n-----\n\n**FB: We map infrastructure with IOCs [indicators of compromise] found on infected devices**\nprovided by investigators and give them new tracks to work on (usually servers to seize,\nintercept, copy). We are a technical support unit working for investigators enforcing CSIRT’s\nprocedures for IR [incident response] and intelligence management.\n\nRansomware infrastructure is often elaborate and extensive. When you add the\njudiciary’s complexity, the investigation is not as fast and reactive for investigators as\nfor perps.”\n\n_— François B., Head of the Computer Security Incident Response Team for the French_\n_Judicial Police_\n\n**TR: Over the past few years, Dutch Police have built a reputation of mercilessly going**\n**after cybercrime groups that operate inside their borders. Is this something French**\n**Police is aiming for in the long term — to make criminals afraid of hosting**\n**infrastructure in France or targeting French users?**\n\n**FB: French police are obviously protecting French citizens, but our main goal is to have a**\nbroader perspective and to have the cybercriminals arrested and prosecuted.\n\n**TR: What are the biggest problems your department has encountered when**\n**investigating and tracking down cybercrime operators?**\n\n**FB: We are gaining in maturity, which is a slow but very interesting process. Resources**\n(manpower and skills) are also mandatory.\n\n**TR: What are your department’s strongest skillsets in combating cybercrime?**\n\n**FB: Since our engineers are embedded in a police department, we try to have the best fit**\nwith the investigators’ mindset and to take advantage of both worlds: technical and police.\n\n**TR: Private-public sector partnerships in the cybersecurity space have evolved over**\n**the past few years. Does the French Police maintain such partnerships?**\n\n**FB: Yes, we maintain such partnerships with incident response companies like Orange**\nCyberdefense, Wavestone, TrendMicro for AV, Linkurious for data analysis, Serenicity\n(detection), Signal Spam, or Phishing initiative.\n\n**TR: How have these partnerships improved your work on active investigations? Any**\n**specific tools or external services that you found more useful than others?**\n\n**FB: They provide us with the most accurate information on an ongoing case, tools, or threat**\nintelligence data.\n\n**TR: Do you investigate APT (state-sponsored hacking) operations as well?**\n\n\n-----\n\n**FB: Our job is focused on cybercrime; state-owned attacks are handled by other services.**\n\n**TR: Security firms often release reports about the most dangerous cyber threats and**\n**trends. However, it’s law enforcement agencies that often see the real and actual**\n**trends of the cybercrime ecosystem. What are the types and forms of cybercrime your**\n**agency is usually dealing with?**\n\n**FB: Our main victim provider is ransomware. We also see a lot of phishing and fraud.**\n\n**TR: You’ve been with the CSIRT-PJ team for more than five years now. Are there any**\n**past cases that stand out in your career the most that you usually remember as some**\n**of your team’s best achievements?**\n\n**FB: Our first case, a RAT sent to a bank. We managed to OSINT the bad guy’s room on**\nGoogle Street View.\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
