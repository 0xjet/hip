We\nalso analyzed further Gamaredon tools that have the ability to inject malicious macros\nand remote templates into existing Office documents.\n\n_Tools linked to Gamaredon and discussed in this blogpost are detected as variants of_\n_MSIL/Pterodo, Win32/Pterodo or Win64/Pterodo by ESET’s products._\n\nThe Gamaredon group has been active since at least 2013. It has been responsible for a\n[number of attacks, mostly against Ukrainian institutions, as evidenced in several reports](https://cert.gov.ua/news/42)\n[from CERT-UA and from other official Ukrainian bodies over time.](https://cert.gov.ua/news/46)\n\nIn the last few months, there has been an increase in activity from this group, with\nconstant waves of malicious emails hitting their targets’ mailboxes. The attachments to\nthese emails are documents with malicious macros that, when executed, try to download\na multitude of different malware variants.\n\nGamaredon has leveraged many different programming languages in the past few\nmonths, ranging from C# to VBScript, batch files and C/C++. The tools used by\nGamaredon are very simple and are designed to gather sensitive information from\ncompromised systems and to spread further.\n\nContrary to other APT groups, the Gamaredon group seems to make no effort in trying\nto stay under the radar. Even though their tools have the capacity to download and\nexecute arbitrary binaries that could be far stealthier, it seems that this group’s main\n\n\n-----\n\nfocus is to spread as far and fast as possible in their target’s network while trying to\nexfiltrate data. Could we be missing something?\n\n## Background\n\nFigure 1 illustrates a typical compromise chain in a Gamaredon campaign.\n\n_Figure 1. Typical Gamaredon compromise chain_\n\nWhile most of the recent publications have focused on the spearphishing emails together\nwith the downloaders they contain, this blogpost focuses on the post-compromise tools\ndeployed on these systems.\n\n## Outlook VBA module\n\nThe Gamaredon group uses a package that includes a custom Microsoft Outlook Visual\nBasic for Applications (VBA) project. Using Outlook macros to deliver malware is\nsomething we rarely see while investigating malicious campaigns.\n\nThis bundle of malicious code starts out with a VBScript that first kills the Outlook\nprocess if it is running, and then removes security around VBA macro execution in\nOutlook by changing registry values. It also saves to disk the malicious OTM file\n(Outlook VBA project) that contains a macro, the malicious email attachment and, in\nsome cases, a list of recipients that the emails should be sent to.\n\nNext, it relaunches Outlook with a special option, /altvba <OTM filename>, which loads\nthe Gamaredon VBA project. The malicious code is executed once the\n[Application.Startup event is received. They have been using this module in three](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/outlook.application.startup)\ndifferent ways to send malicious email to:\n\nEveryone in the victim’s address book\nEveryone within the same organization\nA predefined list of targets\n\nWhile abusing a compromised mailbox to send malicious emails without the victim’s\nconsent is not a new technique, we believe this is the first publicly documented case of\nan attack group using an OTM file and Outlook macro to achieve it.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Outlook VBA script creating the malicious email_\n\nBased on the “send to all in contact list” behavior of this malicious VBA code, we believe\nthat this module might have led some organizations to think they were targeted by\nGamaredon when they were merely collateral damage. For example, recent samples\nuploaded to VirusTotal coming from regions that are not traditionally targeted by\n[Gamaredon, such as Japan, could be explained by the actions of this module.](https://blog.trendmicro.co.jp/archives/24285)\n\nAs seen in Figure 2, the VBA code builds the email body and attaches the malicious\ndocument to the email. We’ve seen both .docx and .lnk files being used as attachments.\nThese are very similar to the content of the malicious attachments used in Gamaredon’s\ninitial spearphishing campaigns. Figure 3 shows an email generated by this malicious\ncomponent.\n\n_Figure 3. Email generated by the Outlook VBA module with a Word document attachment that_\n\n_contains a remote template_\n\nThe email contains both English and Russian text. However, as illustrated in Figure 3,\nthere is a problem with the Russian encoding. This was fixed in a later version of this\nmodule — another example of the Gamaredon group’s fast development pace and\napparent lack of attention to detail.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Office macro injection module – CodeBuilder\n\nWe analyzed different variants of malicious modules used by the Gamaredon group to\ninject malicious macros or remote templates into documents already present on the\ncompromised system. This is a very efficient way of moving laterally within an\norganization’s network as documents are routinely shared amongst colleagues. Also, as\nthese macros are run when opening the documents, it is a good way to persist on a\nsystem as some of these documents are likely to be opened multiple times and at\ndifferent times.\n\nThese macro injection modules also have the functionality to tamper with the Microsoft\nOffice macro security settings. Thus, affected users have no idea that they are again\ncompromising their workstations whenever they open the documents. We have seen this\nmodule implemented in two different languages: C# and VBScript.\n\n### C#\n\nThis module was delivered, like many other tools, in a 7z self-extracting archive. Inside,\nthere was a password-protected RAR archive containing a few files. Notably, there were\ntwo text files, one for Word and one for Excel, containing the VBA source code of the\nmalicious macro to be inserted into the targeted documents, and the .NET assembly\nresponsible for finding and compromising existing documents. As illustrated in Figure 4,\nthe assembly name is CodeBuilder.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. CodeBuilder functions in a version that is not obfuscated_\n\nThis .NET module first reduces Office macro security settings for various document\ntypes by modifying the following registry values:\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\<version>\\<product>\\Security\\VBAWarnings\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\<version>\\<product>\\Security\\AccessVBOM\n\nIt iterates over all possible Office <version> values for both Word and Excel <product>\nvalues. It then scans for documents with valid Word or Excel file extensions on all drives\nconnected to the system. For the drive containing the Windows installation, it scans only\nspecific locations, namely the Desktop and Downloads folders. For the others, it scans\nthe entire drive. The malware moves each located document into the AppData folder,\ninserts malicious Word or Excel macros into it using a Microsoft.Office.Interop object,\nand then moves the document back into its original folder. In the samples we analyzed,\nthe injected macros were simple downloaders.\n\n### Batch file/VBScript\n\n\n-----\n\nThe VBScript version of this module is similar in behavior to the .NET one. The main\ndifference is that instead of inserting a malicious macro into existing documents, it\ninserts references to a remote template into them.\n\n_Figure 5. VBScript using the Document.AttachedTemplate property to inject a reference to a remote_\n\n_template into existing documents_\n\nThis VBScript module also comes packaged in a self-extracting archive, containing one\nbatch file and two VBS files responsible for iterating through documents and adding the\nremote template references to them.\n\n## Module updates\n\n[Interestingly, some of the custom tools described in Palo Alto Networks’ 2017 blogpost](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-title-gamaredon-group-toolset-evolution/)\non Gamaredon are still being updated and in use today. Some show significant\nsimilarities while others are rewrites in different coding languages. The most prevalent\ntools downloaded and installed on compromised machines can be broadly grouped into\ntwo different categories: downloaders and backdoors.\n\n### Downloaders\n\nThere are many variations of their downloaders, most of them written in either C# or\nVBScript. This section will cover only two of their most original variants; the others have\nnot evolved that much and are very simple.\n\n**_C# compiler module_**\n\nThis .NET executable, similar to many other tools used by the Gamaredon group, uses\nobfuscation techniques such as junk code insertion and string obfuscation. It contains in\nits body the base64-encoded source code of a downloader. It decodes that source code\nand compiles it directly on the system using the built-in\nMicrosoft.CSharp.CSharpCodeProvider class. It places the resulting executable in an\nexisting directory and creates a scheduled task that will launch it every 10 minutes. As\ncan be seen in Figure 6, the decoded source code still has comments in it, illustrating the\napparent sloppiness of Gamaredon’s operators.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Part of the C# downloader source code included in the C# compiler module_\n\n**_GitHub project module_**\n\nAs seen in Figure 7, this .NET executable uses a GitHub repository to obtain and execute\na downloader. This repository is now gone, but we were able to download a copy of it\nwhile it was still available.\n\n_Figure 7. .NET module responsible for downloading and executing a payload stored on github.com_\n\nThe repository contained a single file — readme.txt — that was a base64-encoded .NET\ndownloader executable. The role of the GitHub project module is to download this file,\ndecode it and execute it.\n\n### Backdoors – file stealers\n\nWhile some variations exist in functionalities, the main purpose of these modules is to\nenumerate all documents on a compromised system and upload them to the C&C server.\nThese file stealers can also download and execute arbitrary code from the C&C server. As\nwith many other tools used by the Gamaredon group, they come in four different coding\nlanguages: C/C++, C#, batch file and VBScript.\n\n**_C/C++_**\n\n\n-----\n\n[This variant is the successor of the USBStealer module described here. Although the](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-title-gamaredon-group-toolset-evolution/)\nlatest versions are now quite different, examining samples of this module throughout its\ndevelopment clearly shows it originates from the same source code.\n\nOne sample that illustrates this shift well is a 64-bit DLL with internal name\nHarvesterx64.dll, compiled in June 2019. It still has most of the strings used in the older\nvariants, but also exhibits two improvements that are still in the newer ones. First, it\nnow resolves Windows APIs via name hashing and second, it uses a basic text file\ninstead of a SQLite database to track which files were already uploaded to the C&C\nserver.\n\nThe behavior of this module is quite straightforward: it scans the system for new\nMicrosoft Office documents, both on local and removable drives, and uploads them to\nthe C&C server. To know whether the document is new, the module keeps, in a text file,\none MD5 hash per file uploaded to the server. These MD5 hashes are not based on the\nfile content, but rather on a string composed of the file name, its size and its last\nmodified time. The module’s strings are stored in its .data section, encrypted with a\nsimple XOR key. It also has the ability to download and execute arbitrary code from its\nC&C server.\n\n**_C#_**\n\nThis is a reimplementation in C# of the C/C++ version. The major difference is that it\nalso takes screenshots of the compromised computer every minute. As seen in Figure 8,\nthe version we analyzed has five different threads with evocative names.\n\n_Figure 8. C# backdoor thread creation routine_\n\n**_Batch file/VBScript_**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis version comprises several scripts, written in both batch file form and VBScript. The\nultimate goal is the same, though: scanning the system for sensitive documents. The\nmain mechanism is a batch file that searches for Word documents (*.doc*) on the\nsystem and stores their names in a text file (see Figure 9).\n\n_Figure 9.Example inject.txt file containing the result of the backdoor’s document file scan_\n\nThe package also contains encrypted script files named 1.log, 2.log, 3.log, 4.log and 5.log.\nOnce decrypted, these scripts are obfuscated VBScript downloaders that are able to\ndownload and execute arbitrary code.\n\n## Network infrastructure\n\nThe Gamaredon group uses many different domains, both free and paid, for its C&C\nservers. Free domains are mostly DDNS from No-IP: hopto.org, ddns.net, myftp.biz,\nwhile paid domains are registered through the REG.RU registrar and include the .fun,\n.site, .space, .ru, .website and .xyz TLDs.\n\nThey are constantly changing the domains used by their tools, but mostly on a small\nnumber of ASNs. Careful analysis suggests they use separate domains for small groups\n[of victims. Please check ESET’s GitHub account for an extensive list of domains used by](https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/gamaredon)\nthe Gamaredon group.\n\n## Quality of execution\n\nWe were able to collect numerous different samples of malicious scripts, executables and\ndocuments used by the Gamaredon group throughout their campaigns. We noticed\nseveral mistakes in these, especially in scripts. It is of course impossible to know the\nexact reason behind these bugs or oversights, but the volume of samples the group\nproduces and their rapid development could explain it. The fact that there were\ncomments left in the source code included in some C# compiler module samples or that\nthe Russian encoding was wrong in email generated by the Outlook VBA module shows\nthat there is no stringent review or testing before releasing their many tools and using\nthem in the wild.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, while these errors might lower their tools’ overall effectiveness, this group’s\nrapid execution and adaptation also has some advantages. The volume and\nrelentlessness of the attacks can create a state of constant dread in their targets. And\nalthough the code is very simple, some techniques, such as script obfuscation, make it\nhard to fully automate the analysis, making the analyst’s job tedious.\n\nTheir GitHub project allowed us a glimpse into the rapid development of their tools. The\ncode that was committed there clearly showed the evolution of the C# downloader. The\nfirst versions showed no signs of obfuscation; then the developers added different string\nobfuscations and junk code to make the analysis harder.\n\nIn terms of persistence, several different techniques are used, but the most common\nones are scheduled tasks, autorun registry keys and leveraging the Startup folder.\nAlthough these techniques are very simple and have been known for a long time, the\nGamaredon group’s strategy of trying to install multiple scripts and executables on each\nsystem, and constantly updating them, significantly complicates the defender’s lives.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite the simplicity of most of their tools, the Gamaredon group also is capable of\ndeploying some novelty, such as their Outlook VBA module. However, as it is far from\nstealthy, in the long run it is no match for a capable organization. The variety of tools\nGamaredon has at its disposal can be very effective at fingerprinting a machine and\nunderstanding what sensitive data is available, then spreading throughout the network.\nCould this just be a way to deploy a much stealthier payload?\n\n_[Special thanks to ESET Senior Malware Researcher Anton Cherepanov for his help in](https://www.welivesecurity.com/author/acherepanov/)_\n_this research._\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n\n**SHA-1**\n\n\n**ESET de-**\n**tection**\n**name** **Comments**\n\n\n6F75F2490186225C922FE605953038BDEB537FEE DOC/TrojanDownloader.Agent.ARJ\n\nDFC941F365E065187B5C4A4BF42E770035920856 Win32/Pter\nodo.XG.gen\n\n\n9AFC9D6D72F78B2EB72C5F2B87BDC7D59C1A14ED\n\n\nWin32/Pter\nodo.ZM\n\n\nOutlook VBA\nmodule\n\nC# Office macro\ninjection module\n\nBatch file/ VBScript Office\nmacro injection\nmodule\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA-1**\n\n3DD83D7123AEFBE5579C9DC9CF3E68BCAFC9E65E\n\n\n**ESET de-**\n**tection**\n**name** **Comments**\n\n\nMSIL/Ptero\ndo.CD\n\n\n941F341770B67F9E8EE811B4B8383101F35B27CD MSIL/Ptero\ndo.CA\n\n\nDC8BD2F65FD2199CE402C76A632A9743672EFE2D\n\n336C1244674BB378F041E9064EA127E9E077D59D\n\n5FC1B6A55A9F5A52422872A8E34A284CDBDD0526\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n\nWin32/Pter\nodo.XC\n\nMSIL/Ptero\ndo.DP\n\nWin32/Pter\nodo.YE\n\n\nC# compiler\nmodule\n\nGitHub project\nmodule\n\nC/C++ backdoor\n\nC# backdoor\n\nBatch file/ VBScript backdoor\n\n\nInitial\nAccess\n\nExecution\n\nPersistence\n\n\n[T1193](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193/) Spearphis\nhing\nAttachment\n\n[T1199](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199/) Trusted\nRelationship\n\n\nGamaredon group sends emails with malicious attachments to its targets.\n\nGamaredon group malware abuses a compromised organization’s email accounts to send emails with malicious attachments to the victim’s contacts.\n\n\n[T1064](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064/) Scripting Gamaredon group uses scripting heavily, mostly Batch\nfiles and VBScript.\n\n[T1085](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1085/) Rundll32 Gamaredon group malware uses rundll32 to launch malicious DLLs, for example the C/C++ backdoor.\n\n\n[T1106](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106/) Execution\nthrough\nAPI\n\n[T1204](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) User\nExecution\n\n[T1053](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/) Scheduled Task\n\n\nGamaredon group malware uses CreateProcess to\nlaunch additional components, for example to execute\npayloads received from its C&C servers.\n\nInitial compromise by the Gamaredon group usually requires the user to execute a malicious email\nattachment.\n\nGamaredon group malware registers several of its modules (downloaders, backdoors, etc.) as scheduled\ntasks.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n\nGamaredon group uses Run keys and the Startup folder to ensure its modules are executed at every reboot.\n\nGamaredon group malware inserts malicious macros\ninto existing documents, providing persistence when\nthey are reopened.\n\nGamaredon group makes heavy use of compressed\narchives, some password protected, to deliver its malicious payloads.
