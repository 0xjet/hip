ZeuS Botnet for Dummies\n\n**[malwareint.blogspot.com/2009/07/special-zeus-botnet-for-dummies.html](http://malwareint.blogspot.com/2009/07/special-zeus-botnet-for-dummies.html)**\n\nAfter dealing with some emphasis on the activities of the most active botnets now, ZeuS, let's\nsee a more detailed description of their crime.\n\nIf we talk about malware and botnets, no doubt ZeuS has a particular advantage due to the\namount of zombies that are part of its campus. ZeuS is designed to steal any information that\nis stored on the computers of victims remotely and carry out other attacks aimed at stealing\ninformation such as phishing.\n\nTherefore, we could say that ZeuS is a spyware, but also has capabilities for other types of\nmalware such as backdoors, trojans and viruses. However, the author mentions in the\ninstallation manual that you don't like to call any of these forms in this crimeware, but will\nrefer to it as a \"bot software\".\n\nAlthough we know the external face of ZeuS (the web interface management and control of\nzombies), has certain features that are constantly evolving and professionalize achieving\ngreater flexibility and adaptability to ensure operation on different versions of Windows. This\nmakes ZeuS a latent threat and very dangerous for any information system.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this sense, ZeuS also ensures performance working on the privilege level 3 (where the\napplications are) the operating system to avoid incompatibilities between the implementation\nof equipment and devices (which operate at lower levels). Though it may seem an irrelevant\nfact, this allows greater flexibility and hence a higher yield at the time of the fraudulent and\ncriminal activities for which it was conceived.\n\nThe latest version of ZeuS is written with version 9 of the C + + language, and among the\nfeatures that have this web application (malicious), we can mention:\n\n_Monitor network traffic (sniffer) TCP._\n\n_Intercepts the FTP and POP3 connections from any port._\n_Intercepts HTTP and HTTPS requests from all applications that work with the library_\n_wininet.dll (eg IE). This demystifies the myth in which ZeuS uses a BHO to intercept_\n_applications through IE._\n_Functions server (socks4/4a/5)._\n_Backconnect for all of the infected computer services (RDP, Socks, FTP, etc.)._\n_Get screenshots in real time._\n_Ability to conduct phishing attacks._\n_Incorporates anti-analysis mechanisms._\n_Constructor of the trojan that spreads and configuration file._\n_Polymorphic encryption._\n\nAnother technical detail is that all communication is done by ZeuS through a symmetric\nencryption algorithm (RC4).\n\nThe server is the heart of ZeuS, and\n\nany botnet, and who is to obtain all records of infected computers that are part of the botnet\nand execute commands remotely.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the other hand, many botnets\n\nusing virtual servers to their criminal operations. However, this plays against the botnet when\nis very large, if ZeuS, as usually, the virtual servers don't have too many resources, so it's\ncustomary for botmaster using dedicated servers to host the bot. This is an important fact to\nkeep in mind during the research side.\n\nAccordingly, and as every application requires a minimum of resources to run satisfactorily, in\nthe case of this botnet, the requirements are just to have 2GB of RAM and 2x frequency of 2\nGHz CPU. As we see, the minimum requirements aren't at all a constraint VIP. Anyone can\nimplement ZeuS, even without these minimum requirements.\n\nFurthermore, it's assumed that the computer is running an HTTP server with PHP (the\nlanguage is generally develop these crimeware) and MySQL (to create the database with\nstatistical information that shows your activity). Another requirement is Zend Optimizer, which\nis necessary to protect and optimize the scripts.\n\nWith regard to updates, ZeuS is also can be \"groomed\" by newer versions without too much\neffort. During the last six months have been released five versions (based on each one\napprox. 35 days) with correction of errors, changes and new features, not the versions with\nsmaller arrangements.\n\nAfter looking at the diagram, many wonder what the number of each version. A teaching\nmode could say that if we have the \"A.B.C.D\" ...\n\nA means a complete package of crimeware.\nB represents changes that cause total or partial incompatibility with earlier versions.\nC specifies error correction, added functionality, improvements, etc..\nD is the number of refuds (changes) to the current version.\n\nThis is just a screenshot of what can and ZeuS represents in terms of skills and maneuvers\nthat have an environment within which criminal crimeware applications are the main actors\n\n\n-----\n\n**Related information this Blog**\n[Botnet.
