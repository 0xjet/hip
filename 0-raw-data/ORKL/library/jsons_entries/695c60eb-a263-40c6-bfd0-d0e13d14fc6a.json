    "plain_text": "# Researchers Find New Evidence Linking Kwampirs Malware to Shamoon APT Hackers\n\n**[thehackernews.com/2022/03/researchers-find-new-evidence-linking.html](https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/researchers-find-new-evidence-linking.html)**\n\nMarch 14, 2022\n\nNew findings released last week showcase the overlapping source code and techniques between\n[the operators of Shamoon and](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.disttrack) [Kwampirs, indicating that they \"are the same group or really close](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.kwampirs)\ncollaborators.\"\n\n\"Research evidence shows identification of co-evolution between both Shamoon and Kwampirs\n[malware families during the known timeline,\" Pablo Rincón Crespo of Cylera Labs said.](https://resources.cylera.com/new-evidence-linking-kwampirs-malware-to-shamoon-apts)\n\n\"If Kwampirs is based on the original Shamoon, and Shamoon 2 and 3 campaign code is based on\nKwampirs, […] then the authors of Kwampirs would be potentially the same as the authors of\nShamoon, or must have a very strong relationship, as has been seen over the course of many\nyears,\" Rincón Crespo added.\n\nShamoon, also known as DistTrack, functions as an information-stealing malware that also\nincorporates a destructive component that allows it to overwrite the Master Boot Record (MBR) with\narbitrary data so as to render the infected machine inoperable.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware, developed by the eponymous hacking crew also tracked as Magic Hound,\nTimberworm, COBALT GIPSY, was [first documented by Broadcom-owned Symantec in August](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=281521ea-2d18-4bf9-9e88-8b1dc41cfdb6&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\n2012. At least two updated versions of Shamoon have since emerged, Shamoon 2 in 2016 and\nShamoon 3 in 2018.\n\n[In July 2021, the U.S. government attributed Shamoon as the handiwork of Iranian state-sponsored](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/jsar/JSAR-12-241-01B)\nactors, linking it to cyber offensives targeting industrial control systems.\n\n[On the other hand, attack activity involving the Kwampirs backdoor has been connected to a threat](https://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/unpacking-kwampirs-rat)\ngroup known as Orangeworm, with Symantec disclosing an intrusion campaign aimed at entities in\nthe healthcare sector in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.\n\n\n-----\n\n\"Kwampirs New Campaign Building Process\" explained by Cylera\n\n\"First identified in January 2015, Orangeworm has also conducted targeted attacks against\norganizations in related industries as part of a larger supply-chain attack in order to reach their\n[intended victims,\" Symantec said in an analysis in April 2018.](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/orangeworm-targets-healthcare-us-europe-asia)\n\nCylera Labs' uncovering of the connection stems from malware artifacts and previously unnoticed\ncomponents, one of which is said to be an intermediary \"stepping stone\" version. It's a Shamoon\ndropper but sans the wiper feature, while simultaneously reusing the same loader code as\nKwampirs.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\nWhat's more, code-level similarities have been uncovered between Kwampirs and subsequent\nversions of Shamoon. This includes the functionality to retrieve system metadata, fetch MAC\naddress, and the victim's keyboard layout information as well as the use of the same\n[InternetOpenW Windows API to craft HTTP requests to the command-and-control (C2) server.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wininet/nf-wininet-internetopenw)\n\n\n-----\n\n\"Shamoon 2 New Campaign Building Process\" explained by Cylera\n\nAlso put to use is a common template system to create the reporter module that houses capabilities\nto upload host information and download additional payloads to execute from their C2 servers, a\nfeature that was missing in the first version of Shamoon.\n\nIn connecting the disparate dots, the investigation has led to the assessment that Kwampirs is likely\nbased on Shamoon 1 and that Shamoon 2 inherited some of its code from Kwampirs, implying that\nthe operators of both the malware are different sub-groups of a larger umbrella group or that it's the\nwork of a single actor.\n\n\n-----\n\nSuch a claim isn't without precedence. Just last week, Cisco Talos [detailed the TTPs of another](https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/iranian-hackers-targeting-turkey-and.html)\nIranian actor called MuddyWater, noting that the nation-state actor is a \"conglomerate\" of multiple\nteams operating independently rather than a single threat actor group.\n\n\"These conclusions, if indeed correct, would recast Kwampirs as a large-scale, multi-year attack on\nglobal healthcare supply chains conducted by a foreign state actor,\" the researchers concluded.\n\n\"The data gathered and systems accessed in these campaigns have a wide range of potential\nusage, including theft of intellectual property, gathering of medical records of targets like dissidents\nor military leaders, or reconnaissance to aid in the planning of future destructive attacks.\"\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
