Instead of the usual HTTP links, these emails\nwere ridden with FTP links pointing to compromised FTP servers. While most of the links to FTP sites are Australian domains, not all are. The\nFTP links were pointing to a zipped archive. This zipped archive contained a JavaScript that on execution downloads the DanaBot malware.\n\nTo make the phishing message visually appealing, the phishing email used the standard MYOB-like html invoice template as can be seen in\nFigure 1 and 2. The email body contained a short message requesting to pay the said amount before the due date and contained a \"View\nInvoice\" button to view the invoice. On clicking this \"View Invoice\" button a zip archive is pulled down from what we believe is a compromised\nFTP server of an Australian company. FTP credentials are supplied in the FTP link that is embedded in the \"View Invoice\" button.\n\nFigure 1: Fake MYOB invoice phishing message sent by the scammers\n\nA few such FTP links harvested from these emails are listed here. Note the credentials have been masked here:\n\nftp://XXXXX:YYYYY@villablue.com/pd/523972.zip\nftp://XXXXX: YYYYY@ftp.aquaprodive.com/new.aquaprodive.com/303-5098-%2847%29.zip\nftp://XXXXX: YYYYY@ftp.qsl.net/395871581/84122/91664186(4).js.zip\nftp://XXXXX: YYYYY@members.net.au/PUG/9681125-RCP0806(242).js.zip\nftp://XXXXX: YYYYY@ftp.newportgardenseashells.com.au/docs/098274747728377 (47).js.zip\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: A slight variation of the same fake MYOB invoice phishing message sent by the scammers\n\n### Malware Analysis\n\nThe compromised FTP links point to a zipped archive (in this case 0987365299308858885968.zip), which gets downloaded onto the victim's\ncomputer upon clicking the invoice link. This zipped archive contains a JavaScript (JS) downloader. An abridged screenshot of the JS is\nshown in Figure 3. This JS requires the user to double-click to execute it. This launches a PowerShell command (see Figure 4) that would\ndownload the (DanaBot) malware binary \"TempVBH56.exe\", from the URL \"hxxp://buy.biomixers[.]org/ZslSywnaWJ.php\" and execute it\nsilently on the system. The process tree is shown in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 3: Extracted JavaScript from the zipped archive that would execute upon a double click\n\nFigure 4: PowerShell command executed by the malicious JavaScript downloader\n\nFigure 5: Process tree from the JavaScript downloader to malicious executable\n\nThe DanaBot malware seems to be hosted on a domain that has been configured with round robin DNS and thus resolves to multiple IPs that\nare used to rotate and load balance the traffic and point them to the attacker controlled infrastructure. A screenshot of all the DNS A records\nfor this domain are illustrated here:\n\n\n-----\n\nDANABOT\n\nDanaBot is a multi-component banking Trojan written in Delphi and has recently been involved in campaigns specifically targeting Australian\nusers.\n\nFor this campaign, we have observed the malware is divided into 3 components:\n\nThe DanaBot Dropper\n\no TempVBH56.exe (Sha256: 4afad293675bcb39ac2a85307f074cc06410a48f2e14585718193648806521c4)\n\nThe DanaBot Downloader\n\no 091A4F71.dll (Sha256: f10a7b4d2beb20e9d7f3230e7662ead28b468e4554a7107c21e3b85e1c7a0f6a)\n\nThe DanaBot Master DLL\n\no 6AD4B832.dll (Sha256: 06a1a596f3dbc90da832cd2161848bc8f5c8106bc0f44d4f88d8f3ac3a68e51b)\n\nThe DanaBot dropper file \"TempVBH56.exe\", that was downloaded and executed by the PowerShell command discussed in the previous\nsection deflates and drops a DLL file \"091A4F71.dll\" onto the disk and executes it and then deletes itself. We term this file (\"091A4F71.dll\") as\nthe DanaBot downloader. The process tree is shown below in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6: Screenshot of Process Explorer\n\nThe DanaBot downloader \"091A4F71.dll\" executes and downloads the DanaBot master DLL 6AD4B832.dll from the URL\nhxxp://207.148.86[.]218/index.php?\nm=T&a=6&b=32&d=A59615726C504BD47DB190BFECF1A981&g=F497D170&i=8192&u=1&v=610760110&x=0&t=32&e=4856B6847A1DC5880\nand saves it into a hidden folder in %programdata%.\n\nThe DanaBot master DLL then downloads an encrypted file (SHA256:\n3bcb8c86f52f9594f5d94945b30d6d76d4ce2c91eb32df43f6ed4e6c8f576085) from the URL: hxxp://144.202.61.204/index.php?\nm=S&a=6&d=A59615726C504BD47DB190BFECF1A981&g=76941718&e=B06CC1724906F10E3530F5EC7B2B063D\n\nThe Master DLL then decrypts the file and splits it into two new files, the first file contains a sequence of configurations (abridged screenshots\nshown in Figure 7, 8, 9 and 10) %programdata%\\6AD4B89A\\8E7D750C (Sha256:\nf7c3de15cb5a75388163ef64143d4e3036a5f952b62fcf6c536beb5e0f5f8c5d), while the second file contains a sequence of modules\n%programdata%\\6AD4B89A\\96187C5A (Sha256: 8caf436413d8aaf693ea90ab7728d4dcf67ca9f221629c03356db72791f52252). The modules\nand configuration files extracted from these files are listed here:\n\nModules:\n\n\n-----\n\n. d VNC\n2. dll - Stealer\n3. dll - Sniffer\n4. dll - TOR\n\nConfiguration files:\n\n1. PInject\n2. BitKey\n3. BitVideo\n4. BitFilesX\n5. Zfilter\n\nThe filenames of the DLLs extracted from the encrypted file reveal the true intention of the attackers. In essence, these DLLs enable the\nattacker to create and control a remote host via VNC, steal private and sensitive information and use covert channels via Tor.\n\nFigure 7: TCP stream of the modules and configuration files\n\nFigure 8: PInject contains the web injection configuration file where the targets are Australian banks\n\nFigure 9: BitKey and BitVideo contains the list of cryptocurrency processes that this bot will\nmonitor.\n\nFigure 10: BitFileX contains the cryptocurrency files\n\nLastly, this bot has the capability to send the infected machine's system and desktop\nscreenshot to the C&C as shown in Figure 11. All data used by this malware, whether in transit\nor on disk, was heavily encrypted. Detailed flow is shown in Figure 12.\n\nFigure 11: Malware sends the infected machine's system information and desktop screenshot to the C&C\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: Malware campaign flow diagram\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCybercriminals are targeting victims in Australian companies and infecting them with sophisticated multi-stage, multi-component and\nstealthy banking trojans like DanaBot to steal their private and sensitive information. In this campaign the attackers sent targeted phishing\nemails in the form of fake MYOB invoice messages with invoice links pointing to compromised FTP servers hosting the DanaBot malware. The\ninfrastructure supporting the malware is designed to be flexible while the malware is designed to be modular with functionality spread across\nmultiple components that are heavily encrypted.\n\nIOCs\n\nftp://XXXXX:YYYYY@villablue.com/pd/523972.zip\nftp://XXXXX: YYYYY@ftp.aquaprodive.com/new.aquaprodive.com/303-5098-%2847%29.zip\nftp://XXXXXl: YYYYY@ftp.qsl.net/395871581/84122/91664186(4).js.zip\nftp://XXXXX: YYYYY@members.iinet.net.au/PUG/9681125-RCP0806(242).js.zip\nftp:// XXXXX: YYYYY@ftp.newportgardenseashells.com.au/docs/098274747728377 (47).js.zip\nhxxp://buy.biomixers[.]org/ZslSywnaWJ.php\n\nFilename Size Sha256 Codename Download URL\n\ntempvbh56.exe 277504 4AFAD293675BCB39AC2A85307F074CC0 Dropper hxxp://buy.biomixers.org/ZslSywnaWJ.\nbytes 6410A48F2E14585718193648806521C4\n\n(0 MB)\n\n%programdata%\\ 79360 F10A7B4D2BEB20E9D7F3230E7662EAD28B Downloader\n\n|Filename|Size|Sha256|Codename|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|tempvbh56.exe|277504 bytes (0 MB )|4AFAD293675BCB39AC2A85307F074CC0 6410A48F2E14585718193648806521C4|Dropper|\n|%programdata%\\ 091A4F71.dll|79360 bytes (0 MB )|F10A7B4D2BEB20E9D7F3230E7662EAD28B 468E4554A7107C21E3B85E1C7A0F6A|Downloader|\n\n\n-----\n\n%programdata%\\\n\n6AD4B89A\\6AD4B832.dll\n\n\n1645072\nbytes\n\n(1 MB)\n\n\n06A1A596F3DBC90DA832CD2161848BC\n\n8F5C8106BC0F44D4F88D8F3AC3A68E51B\n\n\nMaster DLL hxxp://207.148.86.218/index.php?m=T&\n6&b=32&d=A59615726C504BD47D\n\nB190BFECF1A981&g=F497D170&i=81\n1&v=610760110&x=0&t=32&e=\n\n4856B6847A1DC58800EF1CED6140F\n\nDownloaded hxxp://144.202.61.204/index.php?\nencrypted m=S&a=6&d=A59615726C504BD47DB\nfile g=76941718&e=B06CC1724906F10E3\n\n|<no name>|1626256 bytes (1 MB )|3BCB8C86F52F9594F5D94945B30D6D7 6D4CE2C91EB32DF43F6ED4E6C8F5760 85|Downloaded encrypted file|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|%programdata%\\ 6AD4B89A\\96187 C5A|10112236 bytes (9 MB )|8CAF436413D8AAF693EA90AB7728D4DC F67CA9F221629C03356DB72791F52252|Encrypted module|\n|%programdata%\\ 6AD4B89A\\8E7D 750C|15439 bytes (0 MB )|F7C3DE15CB5A75388163EF64143D4E30 36A5F952B62FCF6C536BEB5E0F5F8C5D|Encrypted configuration files|\n\n\n-----",
