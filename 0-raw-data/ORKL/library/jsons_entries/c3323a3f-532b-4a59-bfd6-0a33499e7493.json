Targeted industries included critical infrastructure, entertainment,\nfinance, healthcare, and telecommunications.\n\nThis overly aggressive campaign appears to be a new operation carried out by a group of\nhackers primarily known as Lazarus Group, the ones responsible for the infamous Sony\n[Studios hack in 2014. Other names for this group are Hidden Cobra, the name US](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H9_xaxQHpWaa4O_Son4Gx0YOIzlcBWMsdvePFX68EKU/pubhtml)\nauthorities are using to describe it, but also the Hastati Group, Group 77, or Labyrinth\nChollima.\n\nThe group operates in bursts of hacking activity aimed at specific targets. Past operations\n[include Operation Troy,](https://cyber-peace.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wp-operation-troy.pdf) [Blockbuster, or](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Report.pdf) [Dark Seoul.](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/11/tdrop2-attacks-suggest-dark-seoul-attackers-return/)\n\n## Operation GhostSecret started last month\n\n\n-----\n\nThe most recent Lazarus Group operation is codenamed Operation GhostSecret and\nappears to have started in mid-March 2018 with attacks targeting the Turkish financial\nsector.\n\nCybersecurity firm McAfee describes this particular campaign as sophisticated due to the\n\"significant capabilities, demonstrated by their tools development and the pace at which [the\nattackers] operate.\"\n\nResearchers identified malware with shared capabilities to hacking tools used in the 2014\nSony hack, but they also found newer tools such as Bankshot (implant), Proxysvc\n(downloader), and Escad (backdoor).\n\n## Attacks amplify in scale following public disclosure\n\nExperts noted that despite exposing the first attacks on the Turkish financial sector, the\ngroup continued its attacks unphased by the attention their tools and hacking infrastructure\nwere getting.\n\nFurthermore, attacks seem to have ramped up, most likely in an attempt to use hacking\ntools while they were still effective and before security software would be able to detect\nthem.\n\nMcAfee said it alerted the Thai government that some of the command and control servers\nused for Operation GhostSecret were hosted on the compromised servers of Thammasat\n[University in Bangkok. ThaiCERT seized and shut down the servers two days ago.](https://www.thaicert.or.th/alerts/admin/2018/al2018ad001.html)\n\n_[A full and detailed report on Operation GhostSecret, including IoCs, is available here.](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/analyzing-operation-ghostsecret-attack-seeks-to-steal-data-worldwide/)_\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Lazarus hackers target VMware servers with Log4Shell exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lazarus-hackers-target-vmware-servers-with-log4shell-exploits/)\n\n[US sanctions Bitcoin laundering service used by North Korean hackers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-sanctions-bitcoin-laundering-service-used-by-north-korean-hackers/)\n\n[Cyberspies use IP cameras to deploy backdoors, steal Exchange emails](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyberspies-use-ip-cameras-to-deploy-backdoors-steal-exchange-emails/)\n\n[FBI links largest crypto hack ever to North Korean hackers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-links-largest-crypto-hack-ever-to-north-korean-hackers/)\n\n[US warns of Lazarus hackers using malicious cryptocurrency apps](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-warns-of-lazarus-hackers-using-malicious-cryptocurrency-apps/)\n\n[APT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/apt/)\n[Cyber-espionage](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Lazarus Group](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/lazarus-group/)\n[North Korea](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/north-korea/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\n\n-----\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a\nfew more.

Perhaps, NK figures it can accomplish its goals more effectively\nvia cyber. If they have effective assets in place now (with the constraints and\nsanctions), how much more effective would they be with more money and access?\nMaybe Kim thinks the Democrats are right about the Russians using cyber to sway\nthe U.S. 2016 elections; and he can do even better with next elections in SK, Japan....\nDon't think he has to worry about the next election in NK.\n\nWith their nuclear program, it will take time even to establish the framework of an\nagreement; then more time to implement - and if they eventually close all their\nfacilities; will all their nukes go to China and Russia, as Syria's chemical weapons did\nto Russia?\n\nSuppose they do shed their nukes; they still have enough conventional artillery to\nflatten the SK capital; it would just take minutes, rather than seconds. A treaty, would\nvoid the UN use-of-force resolution from 1950 - and good luck getting another one\npast Russia and China.\n\nStill, today's breakthrough is a reason for optimism; just as long as it's tempered with\nskepticism - and for heaven's sake: don't send John (let's make a deal), Kerry to\nnegotiate!\n\n\n-----\n\n[rhasce - 4 years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/1062113/rhasce/)\n\nIndeed since it is know that only 30 computes exist on NK and they are in control of\nthe government, so obviously it is the government, why are we playing stupid? :)\n\nPost a Comment [Community Rules](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/posting-guidelines/)\n\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\n\n[Not a member yet?
