Prior to this, the regime saw previous success in](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-north-koreas-hacker-army-stole-3-billion-in-crypto-funding-nuclear-program-d6fe8782)\nstealing from financial institutions by hijacking the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial\nTelecommunications (SWIFT) network. However, this activity brought heavy attention from international\nauthorities, and financial institutions responded by investing in improving their cyber defenses. During\nthe cryptocurrency bubble of 2017, when the technology reached the mainstream, North Korean cyber\noperators shifted their targeting from traditional finance to this new digital financial technology by first\ntargeting the South Korean cryptocurrency market before significantly expanding their reach globally.\nNorth Korean threat actors were [accused](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2022-biggest-year-ever-for-crypto-hacking/) of stealing an estimated $1.7 billion worth of cryptocurrency\nin 2022 alone, a sum equivalent to approximately 5% of North Korea’s economy or 45% of its military\nbudget. This amount is also almost 10 times more than the value of North Korea's exports in 2021,\nwhich sat at $182 million, [according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC).](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/prk)\n\nNorth Korean threat actors’ operations targeting the cryptocurrency industry and how they launder the\nstolen cryptocurrency often mirror traditional cybercriminal groups that use cryptocurrency mixers,\ncross-chain swaps, and fiat conversions. However, state support allows North Korean threat actors to\nexpand the scale and scope of their operations to a level not possible by traditional cybercriminal\ngroups, with approximately 44% of stolen cryptocurrency in 2022 traced to North Korean threat actors.\nTargeting is not limited to cryptocurrency exchanges, with individual users, venture capital firms, and\nalternative technologies and protocols all having been targeted by North Korean threat actors. All of this\nactivity puts anyone operating in the industry at risk of becoming a potential target of North Korean\nthreat actors and allows the regime to continue operating and funding itself while under international\nsanctions.\n\nAnyone operating in the cryptocurrency industry — individual users, exchange operators, and financiers\nwith a portfolio of startups — should be aware of the potential to be targeted by North Korean threat\nactors. Entities operating in the traditional finance space should also be on the lookout for North Korean\nthreat group activities. Once cryptocurrency is stolen and converted into fiat currency, North Korean\nthreat actors funnel the funds between different accounts to obscure the source. Oftentimes stolen\nidentities, along with altered photos, are used to bypass anti-money-laundering and\nknow-your-customer (AML/KYC) verification. Anyone who is a victim of an intrusion linked to a North\nKorean threat group may have their personally identifiable information (PII) used to set up accounts to\nfacilitate the laundering of stolen cryptocurrency. As a result, companies operating beyond the\ncryptocurrency and traditional finance industries should also be on the lookout for North Korean threat\ngroup activity and for their data or infrastructure being used as a launch pad for further intrusions.\nSince most intrusions by North Korean threat groups start with social engineering and a phishing\ncampaign, organizations should train employees to monitor for this activity and implement strong\nmulti-factor authentication such as FIDO2-compliant passwordless authentication.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe regime has clearly identified the continued theft of cryptocurrency as a major source of revenue,\nespecially for funding its military and weapons programs. While it is unclear exactly how much of the\nstolen cryptocurrency ends up directly financing ballistic missile launches, it is clear that both the\namount of cryptocurrency being stolen and the amount of missile launches have dramatically increased\nin recent years. Absent stronger regulations, cybersecurity requirements, and investments in\ncybersecurity for cryptocurrency firms, North Korea will almost certainly continue to target the\ncryptocurrency industry as a source of additional revenue to support the regime.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n  - There has been a steady increase in the number of cyberattacks against the cryptocurrency\nindustry attributed to North Korean threat actors since at least 2017.\n\n  - Even though movement in and out of and within the country is heavily restricted, and its general\npopulation is isolated from the rest of the world, the regime’s ruling elite and its highly trained\ncadre of computer science professionals have privileged access to new technologies and\ninformation.\n\n  - The privileged access to resources, technologies, information, and sometimes international\ntravel for a small set of selected individuals with promise in mathematics and computer science\nequips them with the necessary skills for conducting cyberattacks against the cryptocurrency\nindustry.\n\n  - In 2017, North Korean threat actors were highly active in targeting the South Korean\ncryptocurrency industry during the cryptocurrency bubble before greatly expanding their\ntargeting to the international cryptocurrency market.\n\n  - North Korea has developed an extensive money-laundering network to facilitate the movement\nof billions of dollars worth of stolen cryptocurrency from when it's stolen to when it’s converted\nto fiat currency or used to purchase goods and services for the regime.\n\n  - North Korean threat actors' cybercrime operations and money laundering mirror those of other\ntraditional cybercriminal groups; however, state backing allows North Korean threat actors to\nscale their operations beyond what is possible for traditional cybercriminals.\n\n  - North Korea has stolen over an estimated $3 billion worth of cryptocurrency, with $1.7 billion\nstolen in 2022 alone, possibly funding up to 50% of its ballistic missile program.\n\n### Background\n\nNorth Korea has been [called the “Hermit Kingdom” for its isolation from the rest of the world. The](https://origins.osu.edu/article/making-sense-hermit-kingdom-north-korea-nuclear-age)\nregime’s strict control of society, including the movement of goods, people, and, most importantly,\ninformation, means that very little information gets in or out. But even though the general population is\nheavily isolated from the outside world, leadership in Pyongyang is acutely [aware of new technologies](https://www.recordedfuture.com/north-korea-internet-activity)\nand actively exploits new technologies to fund its regime. In recent years, Pyongyang has found great\nsuccess in stealing from both traditional fiat currency-based banks and digital assets such as\ncryptocurrency. This begs the question: despite being such a closed society, how has the regime been\nso successful in its cyber operations as well as its intrusions?\n\n\n-----\n\n[On July 12, 2023, American enterprise software company JumpCloud announced that a North Korean](https://jumpcloud.com/blog/security-update-incident-details)\nstate-sponsored threat actor had gained access to its network. Researchers at Mandiant later\n[published](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/north-korea-supply-chain) a report stating the group responsible was UNC4899, which “likely corresponds to\nTraderTraitor”, a North Korean cryptocurrency-focused threat actor. As recently as August 22, 2023,\nthe United States (US) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a [notice that North Korean actors](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-identifies-cryptocurrency-funds-stolen-by-dprk)\nwere behind the heists affecting [Atomic Wallet, Alphapo, and](https://therecord.media/millions-stolen-in-atomic-wallet-attack) [CoinsPaid, totaling $197 million in stolen](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/coinspaid-blames-lazarus-hackers-for-theft-of-37-300-000-in-crypto/)\ncryptocurrency. The theft of cryptocurrency has allowed the regime to continue operating under strict\ninternational sanctions, [funding](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/report-north-korean-hackers-stolen-034503145.html) up to 50% of its ballistic missile program. By 2018, some [estimates](https://www.cfr.org/blog/north-koreas-cryptocurrency-craze-and-its-impact-us-policy)\nassessed that North Korea was responsible for half the total amount of stolen cryptocurrency. While in\nrecent years, most of the attention has been on the large cryptocurrency heists the regime has\ncontinuously pulled off, North Korea has a long history of using illicit activities to fund itself.\n\nIn our previous 2017 [report, we highlighted the regime’s previous forays into criminality that go back](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/north-korea-activity.pdf)\ndecades. North Korea has been involved in smuggling since at least the 1970s and a recent [report](https://ig.ft.com/north-korea-oil-smuggling/) by\nthe Financial Times showed that through the help of organized crime groups in East Asia, the regime\ncontinues to engage in smuggling activities today. As recently as 2019, Chinese authorities have [caught](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/nk-china-meth-agents-05282019164756.html)\nNorth Korean officials smuggling methamphetamine across the border. The regime has also been\n[identified](https://www.csis.org/analysis/korean-special-asymmetric-and-paramilitary-forces) participating in the manufacture and distribution of illicit drugs, as well as [counterfeiting](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-109shrg28241/pdf/CHRG-109shrg28241.pdf)\n[American $100 bills. It was estimated in 2016 that illicit economic activities generate $550 million to $1](https://www.csis.org/analysis/korean-special-asymmetric-and-paramilitary-forces)\nbillion annually for the country.\n\nNorth Korea also recognized the asymmetric advantages of cyber when the internet was still in its\nnascent stage. While the regime initially deployed its cyber operators to [conduct disruptive](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8142282.stm)\ncyberattacks against its traditional adversary, South Korea, the country’s leadership quickly learned that\ncyber could also be used as a means to generate more illicit revenue. Initially, North Korean cyber\n[operators focused on stealing personal information from websites and creating tools to steal cash from](https://thediplomat.com/2013/08/cyber-security-in-south-korea-the-threat-within/)\nonline games and then selling them to other criminal actors in the underground economy. The\n[estimated](https://thediplomat.com/2013/08/cyber-security-in-south-korea-the-threat-within/) amount of illicit revenue earned per North Korean operator in 2013 was approximately $500\nper month. More recently, in October 2023, the FBI [said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/19/north-korea-remote-us-workers-missile-program) that overseas North Korean IT workers had\nsent millions of dollars in wages back to North Korea for years.\n\nIt was not long afterward that the regime realized that it could generate more illicit revenue from\ntargeting financial institutions instead of keeping its cyber operators on the fringes of internet\n[cybercrime. From 2015 onward, North Korea likely targeted](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-239a) financial institutions in at least 38 countries.\nThe most well-known heist, the cyberattack on Bangladesh Bank, resulted in $101 million in fraudulent\n[transfers via the SWIFT protocol, $35 million of which was recovered. North Korean cyber operators](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/cyber-heist-federal/)\n[also participate in ATM cash-out schemes, compromising payment switch application servers to](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2018/10/02/hidden-cobra-fastcash-campaign)\napprove fraudulent transactions at banks in Asia and Africa. While the full extent of the regime’s\n[activities is unknown, some estimates put the amount of stolen funds in the tens of millions from banks](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2018/10/02/hidden-cobra-fastcash-campaign)\nin over 30 countries.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order for North Korea to steal and launder millions of dollars, it requires a large number of\nwell-trained cyber operators committed to the regime’s objectives. On September 6, 2018, the US\n[Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed a criminal complaint](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and) against one such individual, Park Jin Hyok\n(박진혁). Park graduated from a prestigious North Korean university, Kim Chaek University of\nTechnology (김책공업종합대학), and reportedly is proficient in multiple programming languages. Based\non evidence in the complaint, it is estimated that Park was dispatched to Dalian, China, in late 2010 to\nwork for Chosun Expo, a front company for the North Korean government, and returned to North Korea\nsometime in late 2013 or early 2014.\n\n[In addition to Park, the US DOJ also sentenced a US researcher to 5 years in prison for conspiring to](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61090064)\nhelp North Korea evade US sanctions and [indicted 2 other North Korean cyber operators, Jon Chang](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-north-korean-military-hackers-indicted-wide-ranging-scheme-commit-cyberattacks-and)\nHyok (전창혁) and Kim Il (김일), in 2021. Kim previously lived in Singapore; North Korea has a [diplomatic](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-singapore/as-kim-arrives-in-singapore-no-north-korean-comrades-in-sight-idUSKCN1J3102)\n[mission in the city-state, and Kim contacted individuals there when he took part in a cryptocurrency](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-singapore/as-kim-arrives-in-singapore-no-north-korean-comrades-in-sight-idUSKCN1J3102)\nscheme to sell shares in Marine Chain, a blockchain-enabled platform for vessel transactions. While\nmany North Korean cyber operators work from inside North Korea, the regime also sends some abroad\nto work, both in semi-legitimate IT consulting work and in conducting cybercrime from other countries.\nThe 2 indictments also show that while these North Korean individuals were heavily involved in\nnumerous schemes to earn money for the regime, from SWIFT hijacking to ATM cash-out schemes from\n2015 to 2019, North Korean operators have increasingly focused on earning money through the\nextensive cryptocurrency system that has grown in recent years.\n\nAs mentioned above, the regime's cyber operators attempted to steal money from financial institutions\naround the world, with a high amount of activity between 2015 and 2019. Despite their success, these\nefforts brought a lot of attention to North Korea’s activities and the scrutiny of government agencies\nand international organizations that were determined to stop them. Moreover, the financial institutions\nthat the North Korean cyber operators were trying to steal from are some of the most well-defended\n[private organizations in the world — for example, Bank of America announced its cybersecurity budget](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/bank-of-america-spends-over-1-billion-per-year-on-cybersecurity.html)\n[would increase to $1 billion a year in 2021. All of this took place as the lightly regulated](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/03/business/cryptocurrency-regulation-stablecoin.html) cryptocurrency\nindustry continued to grow in size, [increasing](https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/fintech/digital-assets/cryptocurrencies/worldwide#revenue) from an estimated $1.09 billion in worldwide revenue in\n2017 to a projected $37.87 billion in revenue in 2023. Many cryptocurrency companies are\n[venture-backed startups](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/12/vc-investment-into-crypto-startups-peaked-right-before-everything-went-to-hell/) with small staffs, and while it is unknown how many cybersecurity\nprofessionals are working in these small businesses, a recent survey [reported](https://insights.corvusinsurance.com/cyber-risk-insight-index-q1-2022/survey-findings-smb-cyber-readiness) that only 8% of small\nbusinesses with fewer than 50 employees had a cybersecurity budget. The North Korean regime seems\nto have found a rapidly growing financial technology industry that has little oversight and is unprepared\nfor a relentless cyber assault.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Threat Analysis\n\n##### A History of Cryptocurrency Targeting\n\nWhile North Korean threat actors [targeted cryptocurrency users and exchanges prior to 2017, we see](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/why-north-korea-interested-in-bitcoin)\n[the first uptick in reported activity (1, 2) against exchanges in South Korea in that year. North Korean](https://www.sisafocus.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=171081)\n[cyber operators compromised](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/north-korea-suspected-in-latest-bitcoin-heist-bankrupting-youbit-exchange/) the South Korean exchanges Bithumb, Youbit, and Yapizon in 2017,\n###### stealing cryptocurrency that was worth approximately $82.7 million at the time. There were also reports of cryptocurrency users being targeted after a breach of customer PII of Bithumb users in July 2017.\n\n In addition to stealing cryptocurrency, North Korean threat actors learned how to mine it as well. In April 2017, researchers at Kaspersky Labs identified Monero cryptocurrency mining software that was installed in an APT38 intrusion, and in January 2018, researchers at the South Korea Financial Security Institute announced that the North Korean group Andariel compromised the server of an unnamed company in the summer of 2017 and used it to mine approximately 70 Monero coins worth about $25,000 at the time.\n\n The cryptocurrency-related intrusions continued at an increasing pace. In 2017, North Korean threat\n[actors conducted spearphishing attacks against the cryptocurrency industry (1, 2,](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/1430) [3), targeting](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/3458)\nexecutives and other employees at cryptocurrency exchanges by spoofing other businesses in the\nindustry and pretending to be job applicants. Throughout 2018 and 2019, North Korean threat actors\n[continued to target](https://securelist.com/cryptocurrency-businesses-still-being-targeted-by-lazarus/90019/) cryptocurrency companies and users with spearphishing emails containing\ncryptocurrency themes and [trojanized cryptocurrency trading applications, duping users into](https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/)\ndownloading the apps before stealing their cryptocurrency. This type of attack, which is called a\n“permit phishing attack”, is when an attacker sends over a malicious script or smart contract for the\nvictim to receive tokens or approve a transaction. Once the permit is authorized or agreed to, the\nattacker can drain the victim’s assets. With the increased use of MacOS operating systems, especially\n[among tech start-ups, North Korean threat actors included MacOS malware in these campaigns to](https://securelist.com/cryptocurrency-businesses-still-being-targeted-by-lazarus/90019/)\ntarget even more cryptocurrency users.\n\nIn 2020, security researchers continued to report on new cyberattacks attributed to North Korean\nthreat actors targeting the cryptocurrency industry. The North Korean threat group APT38 targeted\ncryptocurrency exchanges in the US, Europe, Japan, Russia, and Israel, using Linkedin as a method to\n[initially contact targets (1,](https://www.clearskysec.com/cryptocore-lazarus-attribution/) [2). The group also sent innocuous emails to potential targets, possibly to](https://vb2020.vblocalhost.com/conference/presentations/unveiling-the-cryptomimic/)\nprescreen which individuals were more likely to open emails, before sending spearphishing emails with\n[malicious payloads. Of note, in at least one instance, the malware performed a check for antivirus](https://cyberstruggle.org/delta/LeeryTurtleThreatReport_05_20.pdf)\nproducts, and in the case of Qihoo360 Total Security, an antivirus company based in China, it deleted\nitself and took no further action, indicating that the author of the malware did not want to infect a\nsystem with Qihoo360. While the reason for this is unclear, it is possible that, at the time, North Korea\ndid not want to target cryptocurrency firms that were more inclined to use an antivirus software\nproduced by a company in China.\n\n\n-----\n\n2021 was also a prolific year for North Korea’s targeting of the cryptocurrency industry, with North\n[Korean threat actors breaching](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/north-korean-hackers-have-prolific-year-as-their-total-unlaundered-cryptocurrency-holdings-reach-all-time-high/) at least 7 cryptocurrency organizations and stealing $400 million worth\nof cryptocurrency. Additionally, North Korean threat actors started targeting alternative coins (altcoins),\nincluding Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC-20)-based tokens, as well as non-fungible tokens\n(NFTs). ERC-20 is a standard set of basic guidelines that govern the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain,\nincluding coins, smart contracts, and NFTs. ETH, Polygon (MATIC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), ApeCoin (APE),\nand Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) are just some examples of ERC-20-based tokens. APT38 continued its\n[assault on the industry, abusing the brands of fintech, venture capital firms, and other cryptocurrency](https://securelist.com/the-bluenoroff-cryptocurrency-hunt-is-still-on/105488/)\ncompanies in spearphishing campaigns. The group targeted individuals and companies in the\ncryptocurrency industry in Russia, Poland, Slovenia, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, China, India, the US,\nHong Kong, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Vietnam. However, despite their large\namount of success in stealing cryptocurrency, North Korean threat actors were not in a rush to cash\nout. In January 2022, researchers at Chainalysis [identified $170 million in cryptocurrency that still](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/north-korean-hackers-have-prolific-year-as-their-total-unlaundered-cryptocurrency-holdings-reach-all-time-high/)\nneeded to be cashed out from breaches dating back to 2017.\n\nThe pace of reports on North Korean threat activity targeting the cryptocurrency vertical continued to\nincrease in 2022, with threat actors using phishing emails containing links to fake cryptocurrency job\n[descriptions](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/north-korean-hackers-target-crypto-experts-with-fake-coinbase-job-offers/) as lure documents. Notable attacks in 2022 attributed to APT38 include the [Ronin Network](https://therecord.media/more-than-625-million-stolen-in-defi-hack-of-ronin-network/)\ncross-chain bridge ($600 million in losses), the Harmony blockchain bridge ($100 million in losses), the\n[Qubit Finance](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/qubit-hack-north-korea/) [bridge ($80 million in losses), and the Nomad](https://decrypt.co/106820/nomad-recovers-ethereum-tokens-hack) bridge ($190 million in losses). These 4\n[attacks specifically targeted the cross-chain bridges of these platforms. Cross-chain bridges](https://medium.com/coinmonks/cross-chain-bridge-vulnerability-summary-f16b7747f364) connect 2\nblockchains, which allows users to send 1 type of cryptocurrency from 1 blockchain to another\nblockchain that contains a different cryptocurrency. Most bridges work by using validators similar to\nminers, where transactions on the blockchain are entered into a smart contract and then validated.\nPrivate keys are needed to use a validator to sign a transaction. Once they are validated, the funds are\nthen sent and transferred to the end target cryptocurrency. During these attacks, North Korean threat\nactors targeted the validator keys of these organizations.\n\nThe geographic breakdown of North Korean threat groups’ targeting in the cryptocurrency industry is\n[similar to our previous reporting, where Kimsuky has been seen targeting the cryptocurrency industry in](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/4501?category=957259)\nSouth Korea, and Lazarus Group has a more global [presence](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/lazarus-operation-interception-targets-macos-users-dreaming-of-jobs-in-crypto/) in their cryptocurrency targeting\noperations. In 2022, Lazarus [used strategic web compromise as an initial access vector when targeting](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/countering-threats-north-korea/)\nindividuals in the cryptocurrency vertical, something not as commonly seen in North Korean\ncyberattacks against targets in the industry. North Korean threat actors also [experimented with](https://securelist.com/lazarus-trojanized-defi-app/106195/)\ntrojanized DeFi applications that will manage a user’s wallet but will also install a backdoor on their host\nmachine.\n\nIn October 2022, the Japanese National Police Agency [announced that Lazarus Group had targeted](https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/politics/defense-security/20221015-64792/)\ncompanies operating in the cryptocurrency industry in Japan. While specific details were not given, the\nannouncement stated that some companies were successfully compromised and had cryptocurrency\nstolen. In the same month, North Korean threat actors [created](https://www.boannews.com/media/view.asp?idx=110934) a fake cryptocurrency application for\nAndroid phones that was designed to steal money, and toward the end of 2022, security researchers at\n\n\n-----\n\n[SlowMist reported on a new phishing campaign targeting NFT users attributed to North Korean threat](https://slowmist.medium.com/slowmist-our-in-depth-investigation-of-north-korean-apts-large-scale-phishing-attack-on-nft-users-362117600519)\nactors using fake NFT websites, including a fake DeFi platform run by the North Korean threat actors.\n\nWhile theft amounts are down from August 2022, 2023 has so far been a profitable year for North\nKorean threat actor groups. Between January and August 2023, APT38 allegedly stole $200 million\n[from Atomic Wallet](https://therecord.media/millions-stolen-in-atomic-wallet-attack) ($100 million in losses), [AlphaPo](https://decrypt.co/150282/north-korean-hacker-cell-lazarus-allegedly-behind-60m-alphapo-hack) ($60 million in losses across 2 attacks), and\n[CoinsPaid](https://coinspaid.com/tpost/k4r6jt90p1-the-coinspaid-hack-explained) [($37 million in losses). Also in January, the US FBI confirmed](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-confirms-lazarus-group-cyber-actors-responsible-for-harmonys-horizon-bridge-currency-theft) that APT38 was behind the\n$100 million theft of virtual currency from Harmony’s Horizon bridge. In the July 2023 CoinsPaid attack,\nAPT38 operators likely posed as recruiters and specifically targeted employees of CoinsPaid, sending\nrecruiting emails and LinkedIn messages to notable CoinsPaid engineers. CoinsPaid said it believed that\nAPT38 spent 6 months attempting to gain access to its network.\n\nOn July 20, 2023, CrowdStrike assessed that the Lazarus Group accessed systems of the US-based\nenterprise software company JumpCloud in order to target the company’s cryptocurrency clients and\nsteal cryptocurrency funds. JumpCloud is a directory-as-a-service company that aims to provide a\nreplacement for Active Directory (AD) and offers features such as password and device management.\n[On the same day, SentinelOne also reported that JumpCloud was targeted by a North Korean](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/jumpcloud-intrusion-attacker-infrastructure-links-compromise-to-north-korean-apt-activity/)\nstate-sponsored APT. The incident was initially discovered on June 27, 2023, and although initially no\nevidence was found to suggest customers were affected, on July 5, 2023, unusual activity was\ndetected in the commands framework for a small group of customers during a follow-up investigation.\nJumpCloud disclosed that the attack was highly targeted and affected specific customers. Details\nregarding the number of affected customers have not been released; however, many were [reportedly](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/20/north-korea-backed-hackers-breached-jumpcloud-to-target-cryptocurrency-clients/) in\nthe cryptocurrency vertical.\n\n**Figure 1: North Korean state-sponsored activity targeting the cryptocurrency industry (Source: Recorded Future Intelligence**\nCloud)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Moving the Stolen Assets\n\nAs previously mentioned, North Korea has an extensive history of conducting illicit smuggling and other\ncriminal activities that naturally caused the country to build up asset-laundering networks and methods.\nIn 2020, leaked [documents](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/secret-documents-show-how-north-korea-launders-money-through-u-n1240329) from the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network show individuals openly\nlaundering tens of millions of dollars through the US financial system, routing money through China,\nSingapore, Cambodia, and elsewhere to support the North Korean regime. Often these individuals work\nfor North Korea’s primary intelligence organization, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), as in the\ncase of a North Korean intelligence officer who was extradited and [sentenced in the US for setting up](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-national-sentenced-money-laundering-offenses)\nfront companies and laundering money for the regime.\n\nWhile there are few details regarding most of these money-laundering operations and the effort to track\nthem is complex and time-consuming for authorities, there is 1 instance where many of the details were\nmade public. In the 2016 Bangladesh Bank theft, the North Korean cyber operators [sent the stolen](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/03/magazine/money-issue-bangladesh-billion-dollar-bank-heist.html)\nmoney to 4 bank accounts in the Philippines and then converted $61 million USD into Philippine pesos\nfor use at the Solaire Resort, a casino in the Philippines. In 2017, the US State Department [identified the](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/03/magazine/money-issue-bangladesh-billion-dollar-bank-heist.html)\nPhilippines as a major money-laundering location. The stolen money was used to gamble at the casino,\nand any winnings would have been untraceable. The two individuals responsible for most of the\n[gambling, only known as Ding and Gao, boarded](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/03/magazine/money-issue-bangladesh-billion-dollar-bank-heist.html) charter flights to Macau after the operation was\n[complete. Macau has a history](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-57520169) of North Korean operations, including being the location where the\nNorth Korean spy responsible for the 1987 Korean Air flight bombing trained, a hub for laundering\ncounterfeit $100 notes in the early 2000s, and where Kim Jong Un’s older half-brother lived in exile\nbefore he was assassinated in Malaysia in 2017.\n\nNorth Korea must also launder, clean, and anonymize stolen cryptocurrency. In 2022, 2 popular\n[cryptocurrency mixers — Blender[.]io (1) and Tornado[.]cash (1) — were identified as being used by](https://therecord.media/cryptocurrency-mixer-sanctions-ofac-blendrio-lazarus-group)\nNorth Korean threat actors to launder stolen cryptocurrency. It is suspected that North Korean threat\nactors used Blender[.]io to launder over $25 million worth of stolen funds from the Ronin Network as\nwell as using Tornado[.]cash to launder just over $553 million stolen during the Ronin Network,\nHarmony Bridge, and Nomad attacks. In August 2023, the founders of Tornado Cash were [charged with](https://therecord.media/us-arrests-tornado-cash-cofounder)\nover $1 billion worth of cryptocurrency laundering for North Korea. In March 2020, the US DOJ [charged](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-nationals-charged-laundering-over-100-million-cryptocurrency-exchange-hack)\n2 Chinese nationals with laundering over $100 million in cryptocurrency that was stolen by North\nKorean threat actors in 2018. The North Koreans first attempted to obscure the flow of the stolen\ncryptocurrency by mixing it before using some of it to purchase online infrastructure used in further\n[cyberattacks against the financial industry. They employed 2 Chinese nationals who would convert the](https://www.justice.gov/d9/press-releases/attachments/2020/03/02/yinyin_jiadong_indictment-filed_0.pdf)\ncryptocurrency into fiat currency for a fee at two unnamed cryptocurrency exchanges. Afterward, the\nmoney was deposited into a bank account at China Guangfa Bank. One of the individuals would also sell\ncryptocurrency in exchange for iTunes gift cards, a commonly [known](https://cybersixgill.com/news/articles/how-gift-cards-are-used-to-launder-money) form of money laundering.\n\nNorth Korean threat actors also use the accounts and personal information of phishing victims to\nregister verified accounts at trusted cryptocurrency exchanges where they can send the stolen\ncryptocurrency and cash out, as was the [case where approximately $40 million in BTC was stolen from](https://www.justice.gov/d9/press-releases/attachments/2020/03/02/yinyin_complaint_final_20cv606_redacted_0.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nan unnamed exchange and transferred to an account at an exchange in South Korea registered with\nstolen personal information. Obtaining these verified accounts, which often provide valid information for\nKYC and AML requirements, is often a crucial step during this process as funds coming from these\nverified exchanges, banks, and finance applications are viewed as less suspicious and raise fewer red\nflags to law enforcement and fraud teams. To circumvent KYC regulations, North Korean threat actors\n[use](https://www.justice.gov/d9/press-releases/attachments/2020/03/02/yinyin_complaint_final_20cv606_redacted_0.pdf) stolen personal IDs with altered photos of individuals, which are submitted to the exchanges when\nregistering. After the accounts are registered, the threat actors use a peel chain, where a small amount\nof cryptocurrency is deposited at a time into the cashout account from hundreds or thousands of\naddresses, which is less likely to draw scrutiny than a one-time large transaction. The peel chains are\nconducted in an automated fashion, where a computer script is used to rapidly send the cryptocurrency\nto the desired address.\n\nOn May 28, 2020, the US DOJ unsealed an [indictment](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6971-north-korea-indictment/422a99ddac0c39459226/optimized/full.pdf#page=1) charging 28 North Koreans and 5 Chinese\ncitizens with laundering more than $2.5 billion in assets to help fund North Korea’s nuclear weapons\nprogram. Many of the individuals in the indictment were employees of the Foreign Trade Bank (FTB) of\nNorth Korea, which operated covert branches in Beijing, Shenyang, and Zhuhai, China, including\nmultiple front companies used to purchase goods and launder money. Additional covert branches of the\nbank were identified in Austria, Libya, Kuwait, Thailand, and Russia. In addition to laundering money on\nbehalf of the North Korean regime, these individuals were sent abroad to “study fast developing\nfinancial technologies and experiences of other countries”. As seen in Recorded Future’s previous\n[research, North Korea has a long history of sending promising, loyal individuals abroad to gain exposure](https://www.recordedfuture.com/north-koreas-cyber-strategy)\nand skills not easily accessible from within the country. In total, over 250 front companies were created\nby the individuals listed in the indictment, often creating new front companies after their old ones were\ndiscovered to have links to the North Korean regime.\n\nNorth Korean individuals also conspire with cryptocurrency traders to conceal the laundering of stolen\ncryptocurrency. In April 2023, the US DOJ unsealed 2 [indictments charging a North Korean FTB](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-foreign-trade-bank-representative-charged-crypto-laundering-conspiracies)\nrepresentative for conspiring with a Chinese national and a Hong Kong British National to launder stolen\ncryptocurrency and to purchase goods through front companies based in Hong Kong. Some of this\nstolen cryptocurrency was traced back to APT38 cyberattacks, and the FTB representative used the\nstolen currency to purchase goods for the regime through the Hong Kong front companies. The FTB\nrepresentative also conspired to launder funds earned through North Korean IT workers who illegally\nworked in the tech and cryptocurrency industries, often obscuring their true identities through fake\npersonas and asking to be paid in cryptocurrency for their work.\n\n##### Comparison to Traditional Cybercrime\n\nNorth Korea, like any state, conducts cyber-espionage operations to gain information from adversary\ngovernments to support national security objectives or further national interests. The country also\nconducts economic cyber espionage to help develop its own domestic industry, something most\n[countries partake in as they develop their economies (1, 2). North Korea differs from almost any other](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/the-china-threat)\n[country, however, because it is a state that devotes](https://www.recordedfuture.com/north-koreas-cyber-strategy) much of its education and intelligence resources to\nrunning criminal operations with the goal of earning money for the regime. The level of activity and how\n\n\n-----\n\nthe state launders its stolen proceeds is discussed above, but how does this activity compare to more\ntraditional financially motivated cybercriminal groups that are not employed by a state?\n\nNorth Korean state-sponsored cyber operators, like other cybercriminals, are often engaged in the\nsame kinds of activities when stealing cryptocurrency. This includes phishing, credential harvesting,\nairdrop scams, and rug pulls. Phishing remains one of the most prevalent tactics used by scammers and\ncybercriminals to steal funds and sensitive information from victims. Cryptocurrency users have\nbecome heavily targeted by phishing campaigns, which have used various known and novel techniques\nto achieve their objectives. Known techniques include typosquatting and impersonating major\ncryptocurrency platforms and projects; more novel techniques include targeting users of Discord, a\npopular chatting platform used by the gaming and tech communities, including cryptocurrency users.\nNorth Korean threat actors also employ phishing campaigns that attempt to steal credentials for\ncryptocurrency accounts and wallets. While there is little evidence of how active North Korean cyber\noperators are on more novel communities such as Discord, we see them [active](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/4501?category=957259) in chat platforms in\nSouth Korea, such as KakaoTalk.\n\nTraditional cybercriminals also conduct giveaway scams (also known as airdrops within the\ncryptocurrency ecosystem) impersonating reputable organizations or individuals to persuade victims to\neither provide personally identifiable information, click on phishing links, or directly give or be awarded\na cryptocurrency token or other asset. Airdrops are distributions of cryptocurrency or NFTs sent to\nusers for free. Giveaway scams are often combined with known social engineering techniques observed\nin cybercriminal campaigns, such as typosquatting domains imitating cryptocurrency exchanges.\nNumbers suggest that giveaway scams are skyrocketing, with cybersecurity company Group-IB\n[witnessing](https://www.group-ib.com/media-center/press-releases/massive-crypto-attack/) an aggressive 335% increase in domain registrations tied to giveaway scams in the first half\nof 2022 compared to the entirety of giveaway scam domains observed in 2021. North Korean threat\nactors also engage in such scams, as seen in 2022 Kimsuky [activity in South Korea spoofing an NFT](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/4854?category=957259)\ncompensation for victims of a previous cryptocurrency scam. The group set up a credential-harvesting\nwebsite to steal victim accounts.\n\n[Another popular scam in the cryptocurrency industry is rug pulls, in which scammers advertise a](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-rug-pulls-what-is-a-rug-pull-in-crypto-and-6-ways-to-spot-it)\npromising-sounding cryptocurrency project to raise funds before either selling all tokens (similar to\n[pump-and-dump schemes in traditional finance), blocking sell orders, or stealing funds from users](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/pump-and-dump-schemes#:~:text=In%20a%20pump%20and%20dump,shares%20at%20the%20inflated%20price.)\nusing flawed blockchain contracts. All three actions typically lead to a crash in the asset’s price while\nscammers take in a significant profit and disappear from the public eye. These events typically lead to\nheavy financial losses for investors, who either lose their tokens completely or see the value of existing\ntokens drop to near zero. According to Privacy Affairs, scammers and crypto developers [conducted](https://www.privacyaffairs.com/cryptocurrency-scams-2022/)\n[more than 188,000 rug pulls in 2022. In 2021, rug pulls accounted for 35.9% of cryptocurrency losses in](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/)\nscams ($2.8 billion out of $7.8 billion), according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. Previous\nRecorded Future research [identified a North Korea-linked cryptocurrency platform, Marine Chain, which](https://www.recordedfuture.com/north-korea-internet-usage)\nwas supposedly an asset-backed cryptocurrency that enabled the tokenization of maritime vessels for\n[multiple users and owners. It is unclear](https://www.vertic.org/2019/04/the-curious-case-of-marine-chain-the-dprk-cyberscam-behind-a-blockchain-powered-maritime-investment-marketplace/) how many individuals were duped into investing funds in the\nscam.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Money Laundering**\n\nAfter cryptocurrency is stolen — whether by North Korean threat actors supporting the regime’s nuclear\nprogram or low-tier cybercriminals looking to make a small profit — it needs to be laundered. Both\ngroups need to obscure the source of their stolen currency through a series of steps we’ve previously\nidentified in Insikt Group’s report on [The Business of Fraud. First, the illegally acquired currency enters](https://www.recordedfuture.com/business-fraud-laundering-fund-criminal-underground)\nthe financial system and is disguised in a process called “placement”. Next, the funds are “layered”\nusing methods like converting cash or wiring money between accounts to make the activity harder to\ntrace for law enforcement. Finally, in the “integration” phase, the funds are reintroduced as legitimate\ncurrency through methods that make them appear as normal activity.\n\nNorth Korean threat actors, just like non-state-backed cybercriminals, use cryptocurrency mixers to\nobscure the flow of their illegally acquired cryptocurrency from law enforcement. Threat actors in the\ncybercriminal underground have also relied on exchanging stolen funds via legitimate crypto trading\nplatforms to swap them for “clean” cryptocurrency, which clients of an illicit service would then use to\nwithdraw the funds from any exchange. Insikt Group observed entry-level “cleaning” tutorials on English\nforums such as Nulled Forum in 2021. Money mules are also used by both cybercriminals and North\n[Korean threat actors, with mules likely to continue to be used, knowingly or unknowingly, to launder](https://www.recordedfuture.com/business-fraud-drops-mules)\nmoney for various criminal operations.\n\nWhile both North Korean threat actors and cybercriminals conduct the same types of cybercrime and\nuse similar methods to clean and cash out their funds, the difference between the two groups appears\nto be the scale of operations. According to a Chainalysis [report, in 2022, $3.8 billion worth of](https://go.chainalysis.com/rs/503-FAP-074/images/Crypto_Crime_Report_2023.pdf)\ncryptocurrency was stolen, with North Korean threat actors stealing an estimated $1.7 billion of it.\nTraditional cybercriminal organizations don’t have the resources to support and scale their operations\nthat North Korean state-sponsored threat actors do, and North Korea can use diplomatic cover to\nconduct cybercrime, smuggling, and other illicit activities. Additionally, as seen in the background\nsection and our previous [report on North Korea’s cyber strategy, the regime has a long history of illicit](https://www.recordedfuture.com/north-koreas-cyber-strategy)\nactivity, building up its networks over decades, and it steers its whole society to support these\noperations, grooming promising youth for future careers conducting cybercriminal operations. Its status\nas a state allows the regime to scale cybercriminal and other Illicit operations to a level other\ncybercriminal groups can only dream of.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Mitigations\n\nAs many North Korean cyberattacks targeting cryptocurrency users and firms start with phishing, Insikt\nGroup suggests the following:\n\n  - Enable MFA for software wallets and transactions with a hardware device such as YubiKey.\n\n  - Enable any available MFA settings for cryptocurrency exchanges to best protect accounts from\nunauthorized logins or thefts.\n\n  - Validate verified social media accounts and check username handles for special characters or\nnumber substitutions for letters.\n\n  - Ensure requested transactions are legitimate and validate any airdrops or other free\ncryptocurrency or NFT promotions.\n\n  - Double-check the official source when someone sends an airdrop or anything else pretending to\nbe Uniswap or any other big cryptocurrency platform.\n\n  - Always check URLs and watch redirects after clicking on a link to make sure that the websites\nare official websites rather than phishing sites.\n\nBelow are general tips for defending against other cryptocurrency social engineering scams:\n\n  - Exercise the utmost caution when conducting cryptocurrency transactions. Cryptocurrency\nassets are not protected by any of the institutional safeguards that mitigate “traditional” fraud.\n\n  - Use hardware wallets. Hardware wallets can be much more secure than “hot wallets” like\nMetaMask, which are always connected to the internet. For hard wallets that are connected to\nMetaMask, all transactions must be approved via the hard wallet, which provides an additional\nsecurity layer.\n\n  - Only use trustworthy dApps (Decentralized Applications) and verify smart contract addresses to\nconfirm their authenticity and integrity. True NFT-minting interactions rely on smart contracts\nthat may be part of a larger dApp. Contract addresses can be verified using MetaMask, block\nexplorers like Etherscan, or sometimes directly within the dApp.\n\n  - Double-check the web addresses of official websites to avoid imitations. Some cryptocurrency\ndrainer phishing pages may rely on typosquatting to victimize unsuspecting users.\n\n  - Question offers that are too good to be true. Cryptocurrency-drainer phishing pages attract\nvictims with advantageous cryptocurrency exchange rates or cheap gas fees for NFT-minting\ninteractions.\n\n  - Resist pressure tactics. Scams often induce a sense of urgency to pressure victims into impulse\nactions, and cryptocurrency-drainer phishing scams are no exception.\n\nAdditional mitigations to prevent cryptocurrency losses from thefts, scams, and other malicious\nactivities include:\n\n  - Transfer existing cryptocurrency investments into stablecoins that are backed by governments\nor pegged to a fiat currency to insulate them from market fluctuations.\n\n\n-----\n\n- If cashing out cryptocurrency or other digital assets, only utilize well-known exchanges that\nimplement verification and KYC policies. Conduct research on cryptocurrency exchanges or\nwithdrawal services.\n\n- Do not use OTC exchanges or unvetted mixers/tumbling services.\n\n- Consider moving coins, NFTs, and other assets to hardware wallets, as exploits and scams\ntargeting software wallets will likely increase as users begin to sell off these assets.\n\n- Monitor both software and hardware wallet balances to ensure the balance remains intact.\n\n- Remember seed phrases and ensure they are written down on a physical medium. If they are\nheld on a digital medium, ensure that it is encrypted and stored in a secure manner.\n\n- Be alert and aware of a possible increase in phishing scams and attempts during this downturn\nas users and investors attempt to withdraw coins and assets.\n\n- Enable 2FA on software wallets on cryptocurrency wallets and change seed phrases every few\nweeks if possible to help mitigate the impact of a seed phrase cracker.\n\n- Attempt to verify any links posted within the official Discord or other P2P communication\nplatforms used by NFT creators and sponsors.\n\n- If investing in a new coin or NFT, conduct research and invest small amounts over time to\nmitigate the impact of a rug pull.\n\n- Refrain from downloading apps from untrusted sources, review app permission requests before\napproving root access, and regularly keep Android and iOS devices’ operating systems,\napplications, and firmware updated. Furthermore, Europol recommends users perform a factory\nreset to wipe all data in the partitions that can host malware.\n\n- Use anti-cryptomining extensions, such as the Google extensions minerBlock, NoMiner, and\nAnti-Miner, to block cryptominers across the web and use Ad-Blockers that can detect and block\nmalicious cryptomining code. Furthermore, organizations should reduce the exposure of control\ndevices to ensure they remain inaccessible from the internet.\n\n- [The Recorded Future® Intelligence Cloud can assist with the detection of compromised](https://www.recordedfuture.com/leaked-credentials-risk/)\ncredential information linked to valid accounts to assist in providing context surrounding\nsuspicious user behavior that may include keylogging activity. Recorded Future Intelligence\nCloud users can continue to monitor underground sources to identify the spyware and\nkeylogging tools that are likely to have the greatest impact on their immediate infrastructure or\nsupply chain.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Outlook\n\nNorth Korea has seen major success in its cybercriminal operations targeting the cryptocurrency\nindustry, but how much of an impact has this had on the country? As previously stated, some estimate\nup to 50% of the country’s ballistic missile program is funded through stolen cryptocurrency. North\nKorea’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 was [estimated](https://www.nknews.org/2023/07/north-korean-economy-contracts-for-third-straight-year-in-2022-bank-of-korea/) to be roughly $33.5 billion, and in 2023,\n[according to the Bank of Korea, South Korea’s national bank, North Korea’s economy had shrunk for 3](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/north-korea-economy-shrank-third-year-2022-souths-cbank-2023-07-28/)\nstraight years in a row. Using the 2019 estimate, the amount of cryptocurrency stolen by North Korean\nthreat actors in 2022 equals approximately 5% of North Korea’s economy. This does not include any\nother form of illicit activity or illegal employment of North Korean workers in the IT sector or otherwise.\n[To put this in perspective, roughly 4.2% of US GDP is in the arts, entertainment, recreation,](https://www.statista.com/statistics/248004/percentage-added-to-the-us-gdp-by-industry/#:~:text=U.S.%20share%20of%20value%20added%20to%20GDP%202022%2C%20by%20industry&text=In%202022%2C%20the%20finance%2C%20insurance,GDP%20in%20the%20same%20year.)\naccommodation, and food services sectors. Looking at the amount of cryptocurrency stolen in 2022 as\n[a percentage of North Korea’s estimated](https://www.defensenews.com/global/asia-pacific/2023/01/19/north-korea-passes-new-defense-budget/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20U.S.%20State,among%20170%20countries%20it%20reviewed.) military budget of $4 billion in 2021, the country could finance\n45% of it with cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile it is unclear exactly how much of the stolen cryptocurrency ends up directly financing ballistic\nmissile development and tests, it is clear that both the amount of cryptocurrency being stolen and the\n[amount of missile launches have dramatically increased in recent years. According to the Nuclear](https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/cns-north-korea-missile-test-database/)\n[Threat Initiative, a US-based think tank that tracks the number of North Korean missile launches, the](https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/cns-north-korea-missile-test-database/)\nnumber of launches since 2015 has greatly increased, with a noticeable dip during the COVID-19\npandemic. However, 2022 saw the most North Korean missile launches in a year since the regime\nbegan, with almost 70 launches during the year. As there doesn’t appear to be a slowdown in the\nnumber of cryptocurrency heists attributed to the North Korean regime, it is very likely that some of\nthese funds will end up in the regime’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Additionally, as seen\nabove, given the amount of cryptocurrency being stolen in relation to the size of North Korea’s military\nbudget, the regime has identified a lucrative way to avoid international sanctions and to keep\ndeveloping its nuclear and missile technology. Absent stronger regulations, cybersecurity requirements,\nand investments in cybersecurity for cryptocurrency firms, we assess that in the near term, North Korea\nwill almost certainly continue to target the cryptocurrency industry due to its past success in mining it\nas a source of additional revenue to support the regime.\n\nRegimes such as North Korea are likely to continue to target and attack entities, organizations, and\nelements of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Ronin Network attack, one of the single largest\ncryptocurrency thefts in 2022 ($600 million in losses), was allegedly conducted by a state-sponsored\nAPT group. With the success of these attacks, in the future, these groups are likely to continue to\nimprove their tradecraft for stealing, laundering, and monetizing cryptocurrency in both the short and\nlong term. It is even possible other heavily sanctioned entities, such as Russia, will attempt to duplicate\nthis success or try to recruit insiders who are working at cryptocurrency firms and exchanges, following\nin North Korea’s footsteps.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Insikt Group[®]\n\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group, the company’s threat research division, comprises\nanalysts and security researchers with deep government, law enforcement, military, and\nintelligence agency experience.
