The malware is disguised as ransomware but, if activated by the\nattacker, would render the infected computer system inoperable. We’re sharing this\ninformation to help others in the cybersecurity community look out for and defend against\nthese attacks.\n\nAt this time, we have not identified notable overlap between the unique characteristics of the\ngroup behind these attacks and groups we’ve traditionally tracked but we continue to analyze\nthe activity.\n\nThe organizations affected by this malware include government agencies that provide critical\nexecutive branch or emergency response functions and an IT firm that manages websites for\npublic and private sector clients, including government agencies whose websites were\nrecently defaced.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has published a technical blog post](https://aka.ms/DEV-0586-destructive-malware)\ndetailing Microsoft’s ongoing investigation and how the security community can detect and\ndefend against this malware. We have also notified each of the impacted organizations we\nhave identified so far, partnered with other cybersecurity providers to share what we know,\nand notified appropriate government agencies in the United States and elsewhere. It is\npossible more organizations have been infected with this malware and the number of\nimpacted organizations could grow. We will continue to work with the cybersecurity\ncommunity to identify and assist targets and victims.\n\nWe first detected this malware on January 13 2022. We have already built and deployed\nprotections for this malware into Microsoft 365 Defender Endpoint Detection (EDR) and Antivirus (AV) protections wherever these products are deployed, both on-premises and in the\ncloud. We see no indication so far that these attacks utilize any vulnerability in Microsoft\nproducts and services.\n\nTags: [cyberattacks,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cyberattacks/) [cybercrime,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cybercrime-2/) [cybersecurity,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cybersecurity-2/) [malware,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/malware/) Microsoft Threat Intelligence\nCenter, [MSTIC](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/mstic/)\n\n\n-----",
