During this time, the\nattackers managed to compromise at least 100 computers around the world. This report\nillustrates some of the key findings in our latest white paper, [Trends in Targeted Attacks.](http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp_trends-in-targeted-attacks.pdf)\n\nTargeted Campaigns\n\nTargeted malware attacks are rarely isolated events. It is more useful to think of them as\ncampaigns – a series of failed and successful attempts to compromise targets over a period\nof time. An attacker's prior knowledge of the victim, possibly from a previously successful\nattack, affects the level of specificity associated with a single attack in a malware campaign.\nIn this case, the attackers used messages with an IT security theme that appeared rather\ngeneric but were customized for various targets. The download link in the email messages\nwas made to appear as if it were pointing to the target’s own website. Often, this less-specific\nlevel of targeting focuses on communities of interest and is aimed at acquiring information to\nbe used in a future, more precise attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nMoreover, there is generally a diversity of targets. In this case, the Nitro attackers targeted a\nconcentration of chemical companies but also targeted human rights NGOs, motor\ncompanies and defense contractors.\n\n**_Human Interaction_**\n\nThe backdoor used in the Nitro campaign is known as Poison Ivy. It is a freely available\nTrojan that provides an attacker with full, \"real-time\" access to a compromised computer.\nOne often overlooked component of targeted malware attacks is the reliance on real time\nhuman interaction. This distinguishes them from automated botnets. When the Poison Ivy\nbackdoor connects to the attackers command and control infrastructure there is a human at\nthe other end that can begin exploring the compromised computer and the network to which\nit belongs. This attacker can steal information, install additional malware and compromise\nother machines on the same network. Most importantly, the human on the other end of the\nPoison Ivy Trojan can react to defensive measures taken by the victim.\n\n**_Segmented Infrastructure_**\n\nAttackers need to deploy command and control (C&C) infrastructure in order to maintain\nconnectivity to the computers they compromise. The attackers sometimes maintain distinct\nsets of C&C infrastructure making it difficult to uncover the full extent of their operations.\nUsing the initial malware samples, domains and IP addresses provided by Symantec, we\nwere able to map out three distinct sets of command and control infrastructure. The first set\nof command and control infrastructure contains three domains provided by dynamic DNS\nservices. Attackers often use dynamic DNS services in conjunction with RATs, such as\nPoison Ivy. These services make it easy for the attackers to update their C&C domains to\nnew IP addresses thus maintaining consistent connectivity with the compromised computers.\n\n[Click for larger view](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2011/10/nitro1.jpg)\n\nThe second set of C&C infrastructure centers around three domains which all resolved to the\n[same IP address. The C&C domain, domain.rm6.org was also used in an attack. on the UK](https://www.scottishappraisal.scot.nhs.uk/media/29415/20110825%20-%20targeted%20email%20attack%20v1.1.pdf)\ngovernment in August 2011.\n\n[Click for larger view](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2011/10/nitro2.jpg)\n\nThe third set centers on the domain antivirus-groups.com and the IP address 204.74.215.58\nwhich Symantec has associated with a specific actor which they've codenamed \"Covert\nGrove\".\n\n[Click for larger view](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/files/2011/11/C_and_C_3a1.jpg)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis segmented infrastructure allows the same set of attackers to target different potential\nvictims without having all the attacks linked together. Without additional information, it can be\ndifficult to link together the full scope of targeted malware campaigns. This illustrates how\nimportant threat intelligence is to defensive strategies. Here are some examples of MD5s\nconnecting to the Nitro infrastructure:\n\n37f70717f549f1938e5785527e56978d\n5d075e9536c5494745135c1176981c96\n64a4ad90a55e7b6c30c46135435f50a2\n6e99585c3fbd4f3a55bd8f604cb35f38\n70fcb3446fce23b18d9a12b2ed911e52\n76000c77ea9a214f5b2ae8cc387809db\n87aeec7f7c4ec1b6dc5e6c39b28d8273\n8d36fd85d9c7d1f4bb170a28cc23498a\na98d2c90b9494fc885c7cd35d43666ea\nc128c40bd8acb282288e8138352ce4e1\n841ec2dec944964fc54786a1167713ff\n22f77c113cc6d43d8c12ed3c9fb39825\n6f6d6a848f87fbf26f71549d73da61f4\nb2b9702164512a92733939343275245b\n2173b43a66070aadf052ab66dd6933ce\nf18c7639dbb8644c4bca179243ee2a99\n9ff1e8e227e1be3dbfc55f17d2e97df8\n31346e5b39ddb095d76071ac86da4c2e\n20baa1cbacdab191c717f4ef5626de93\nffa73b9f9e650f50b8568a647a9a35cf\n070d1e5c9299afa47df25e63572a3ae8\nd558e1069a0f3f61fedcf58a0c1995fe\n27103c6c9a80b6cf23789e2f51a846eb\n2ffe59a6a047b2333a1f3eb58753f3bc\n0f54a9757f1a2fef2b04b776714a7546\nc2864aff6360feb36f2ff6a6c634ddb4\ncca3af36dff79b27de093a71396afb8d\n4a35488762f70170dc0d3f46f94a7bcb\n3037049411db0453c91e60393a248be2\ndd5715cb3b0cdddbe131f03cc08f0f57\n4fd6453a606e17e5efb166ad80eba5e0\n091457444b7e7899c242c5125ddc0571\n6e99585c3fbd4f3a55bd8f604cb35f38\n07e266f7fb3c36a1f3a5c5d2d229a478\n17e7022496d8092d3ca76ae9524a7260\n2f37912e7cb6e5c478e6dc3d0e381a24\n5d075e9536c5494745135c1176981c96\n\n\n-----\n\n76000c77ea9a214f5b2ae8cc387809db\na98d2c90b9494fc885c7cd35d43666ea\nc128c40bd8acb282288e8138352ce4e1\ncab66da82594ff5266ac8dd89e3d1539\n70fcb3446fce23b18d9a12b2ed911e52\nc53c93a445d751387eb167e5a2b901da\ndd5715cb3b0cdddbe131f03cc08f0f57\n0f54a9757f1a2fef2b04b776714a7546\n37f70717f549f1938e5785527e56978d\n31346e5b39ddb095d76071ac86da4c2e\n330ddac1f605ff8abf60880c584ed797\n457a2a8d0784e9fc8e49f6ef60f7f29e\n87aeec7f7c4ec1b6dc5e6c39b28d8273\n8d36fd85d9c7d1f4bb170a28cc23498a\nde7e293aa9c4d849dc080f3e87573b24\n64a4ad90a55e7b6c30c46135435f50a2\n\nDefensive strategies can be dramatically improved by understanding how targeted attacks\nwork as well as trends in the tools, tactics and procedures of the perpetrators. Since such\nattacks focus on the acquisition of sensitive data, strategies that focus on protecting the data\nitself, wherever it resides, are extremely important components of defense. By effectively\nusing threat intelligence derived from external and internal sources combined with contextaware data protection and security tools that empower and inform human analysts,\norganizations are better positioned to detect and mitigate targeted attacks.\n\n\n-----",
