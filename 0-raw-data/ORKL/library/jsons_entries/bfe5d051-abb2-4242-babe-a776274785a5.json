In our last report, we exposed a new cyber espionage\n\ncampaign that was conducted in July 2019. Since then, we observed another wave of these attacks,\n\nleveraging new impersonating vectors and IOCs.\n\nUntil these days, Iran was not known as a country who tends to interfere in elections around the world.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, this type of cyber activities had been attributed mainly to the Russian\n\nAPT groups such as APT28 (known as Fancy Bear). The group is infamous for hacking American\n\nDemocratic National Committee emails and targeting German and French campaign members, in an\n\nattempt to circumvent the elections in the US, Germany and France. Microsoft’s October\n\nannouncement exposes, for first time, that Charming Kitten, an Iranian APT group, plays a role in\n\n**the domain of cyber-attacks for the purpose of interfering with democratic procedures.**\n\nOn 4[th] of October 2019[2], Microsoft has announced that Phosphorus (known as Charming Kitten)\n\nattempted to attack email accounts that are associated with the following targets: U.S. presidential\n\ncampaign, current and former U.S. government officials, journalists covering global politics, and\n\nprominent Iranians living outside Iran. These spear-phishing attacks were conducted by Charming\n\nKitten in August and September. **We evaluate in a medium-high level of confidence, that**\n\n**Microsoft’s discovery and our findings in our previous and existing reports is a congruent**\n\n**operation, based on the following issues:**\n\n1. **Same victim profiles – In both cases, the victims were individuals of interest to Iran in the**\n\nfields of academic research, human rights, opposition to the Islamic Republic of Iran's regime\n\n(such as NIAC) and journalists. Although the congruent is not exactly similar, our sample is\n\nmainly based on Israeli victims.\n\n2. **Time overlapping – In our latest report, we mentioned that we have observed an escalation**\n\nof the attacks in July-August 2019. In their announcement, Microsoft mentioned that the\n\nattacks occurred on ‘In a 30-day period between August and September’.\n\n3. **Similar attack vectors – In both cases, Charming Kitten used similar attack vectors which**\n\nare:\n\na. Password recovery impersonation of the secondary email belonging to the victims\n\nin both cases.\n\nb. Both attack vectors used spear-phishing emails in order to target Microsoft, Google\n\nand Yahoo services.\n\nc. In our research, we identified a spear-phishing attack via SMS messages, indicating\n\nthat Charming Kitten gathers phone numbers of the relevant victim. Microsoft found\n\nthat Charming Kitten gathers phone numbers for password recovery and two-factor\n\nauthentications of the relevant victims to gain control to their email accounts.\n\nIn this report, we uncovered four new spear-phishing methods used by this group, alongside with new\n\nindicators of this operation.\n\n1 [https://www.clearskysec.com/the-kittens-are-back-in-town/](https://www.clearskysec.com/the-kittens-are-back-in-town/)\n2 https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/10/04/recent-cyberattacks-require-us-all-to-be-vigilant/\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction\n\n\n-----\n\n#### About Charming Kitten\n\nCharming Kitten, also known as APT35 or Ajax or Phosphorus, is an Iranian cyber-espionage group\n\nactive since 2014[3].This APT is associated with the Ministry of Intelligence of Iran. In our previous report,\n\nwe made an attack timeline. Below is a key event timeline:\n\n          - ClearSky discovered the first wave of phishing attacks, named \"Thamar reservoir\".\n\n###### 2015\n\n         - ClearSky exposed a vast espinage operation against Iranian experts working in the academy, human\n\nrights activists and media personnel.\n\n###### 2017\n\n          - Charming Kitten attempted to attack ClearSky and our customers directly via a fraudulent website\n\nimpersonating the ClearSky portal.\n\n          - ClearSky identified new wave of attacks against researchers in the Middle East, using fake emails\n\n###### 2018 and look-alike websites.\n\n          - March - Microsoft filed an official complaint against the group for “establishing an internet-based\n\ncyber theft operation referred to as 'Phosphorus'.”\n\n          - September - ClearSky published a report about a sharp increase in Charming Kitten attacks. It\n\nappears that group has initiated a new cyber espionage campaign comprised of two stages.\n\n###### 2019 • October - Microsoft announced that ‘the group is making attempts to identify consumer email\n\naccounts belonging to specific Microsoft customers, including a US Presidential Candidate\nClearSky exposed new impersonation vectors.\n\n###### See corresponding footnote for relevant references[4].\n\n3 [https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0058/](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0058/)\n4 2015 - [https://www.clearskysec.com/thamar-reservoir/](https://www.clearskysec.com/thamar-reservoir/)\n2017 - https://www.clearskysec.com/charmingkitten/\n[2018 - https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/iranian-apt-poses-as-israeli-cyber-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/iranian-apt-poses-as-israeli-cyber-security-firm-that-exposed-its-operations/)\n[security-firm-that-exposed-its-operations/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/iranian-apt-poses-as-israeli-cyber-security-firm-that-exposed-its-operations/)\n[March 2019 - https://noticeofpleadings.com/phosphorus/files/Complaint.pdf](https://noticeofpleadings.com/phosphorus/files/Complaint.pdf)\n[September 2019 – https://www.clearskysec.com/the-kittens-are-back-in-town/](https://www.clearskysec.com/the-kittens-are-back-in-town/)\nOctober 2019 - https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/10/04/recent-cyberattacks-requireus-all-to-be-vigilant/\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction\n\n\n###### 2018\n\n\n###### 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Attack Vector\n\nCharming Kitten keep trying to attack their victims with spear-phishing methods. We observed an\n\nescalation in the volume of phishing attempts. It can be divided into three attack platforms \n1. The first platform is sending an email message leveraging social engineering methods.\n\n2. The second platform includes impersonation of social media websites, such as Facebook,\n\nTwitter and Instagram, as well as using these social medias to spread malicious links.\n\nClearsky has observed a few social media entities that contacted their victims on these\n\nplatforms in order to infect them via malicious websites.\n\n3. The third platform is sending SMS messages to the cellular phone of the victim.\n\n#### Impersonation Vectors \n\nAnalyzing this campaign, we identified four impersonation vectors that Charming Kitten uses in their\n\nrecent attacks. Based on our investigation, Charming Kitten tried to carry out all of these vectors\n\nagainst the same victims, and in some cases a few of those on the same day.\n\n##### First Vector - A message with a link pretending to be Google Drive\n\nDuring the first impersonation vector the attacked will receive an email with a link to Google Sites\n\nfrom an acquaintance; for example – a research fellow. Through this vector, the victim is tempted to\n\ndownload a file located at the addressing fellow's Google Sites, and thus collect the victim's Google\n\ncredentials.\n\nThe phishing message that impersonated Google Drive service under the title ‘Middle East Article’\n\nThe link shown above leads to a site built with the Google Sites platform. Additionally, the domain\n\nfrom which the link was allegedly shared is gmail.com, whereas the domain which should appear\n\nwhile sharing Google Sites' sites is google.com; Also, the sharing message should be sent from an\n\naddress which contains 'noreply', and not the sender's address. For a **correct sample of a Google**\n\nSites' site sharing message, see below:\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction\n\n\n-----\n\nCorrect Google Site’s sharing message – the sender’s email is ‘drive-shares-noreplay@google.com’\n\nIn another phishing case, a link to Google Drive is received, supposedly from an unknown person\n\nwhich claims to receive too many spam messages from the victim's address, and directs the victim to\n\na Google Drive containing the proves to this:\n\nEmail sent allegedly from “Sandra Trentini’, which is not related to any of the victims. In that case, Charming\nKitten added a profile picture with 2 letters that represent the alleged sender (ST for Sandra Trentini), as part as\n\ntheir dissembling efforts\n\nIn a third case, the victim received a message from a colleague's email, personally addressing the\n\nvictim to read an article this colleague is currently working on. To add credibility, the attacker also\n\nclaims to have shared the research with another friend.\n\nThe links which appear in the mail lead to a dedicated Google Site, set up by the attacker; those links\n\ncontain the word 'Drive', although they are Google Sites links, probably for additional camouflage:\n\n\nhxxps://sites.google[.]com/view/cubqzpmuxra5bjxu7q2jxcxnhkldpa/drive/\n\n\nhxxps://sites.google[.]com/screenshot-sharing-service/drive/\n\n\nYet, upon entering the site, the attackers try to manipulate the attacked to think that they are at a\n\nGoogle Drive site which contains a link to download the article.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction\n\n\n-----\n\nGoogle’s Sites phishing page executed by the group. Note that the title of the site is ‘Drive’, which customized by\n\nthe attackers.\n\nClicking the download link will make Google redirect to a domain shortened by a shortening service,\n\nwhich will not show the actual address to which the victim is taken, thus increasing camouflaging.\n\nAnother important point – every page at Google Sites is unique to the attacked.\n\nWhen the specific attack will end, the attackers will remove the site from the address shortening\n\nservice or will redirect the address to a true email service. Here are two examples:\n\nAttempt to enter the domain leads to the original Google site\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon an attempt to enter, a Redirect is performed to the Google Account login page, while the malicious site\n\nappears in the address line\n\nIf the attacked has opened the aforementioned link, they will be directed to the malicious site. At the\n\npresent attack wave, we have identified a '.site' TLD dominance. Among the newly opened site:\n\nThe site, which the attacked will visit, impersonates entrance to Google services. The attackers try to\n\nmanipulate the victims to believe, that in order to download the file they need to log in to their Google\n\naccount (for the file is allegedly from Google Drive). Another social engineering technique is to identify\n\nthe Google Site from which the victim was directed and to pair the phishing page with its (the site's)\n\nemail. In other words, the victim receives an email from the attacker with a link which was prepared\n\nfor them personally. Identifying the attack – at the address line, the victim's email appears, and if it\n\nwill be changed, the email presented at the site will change as well.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction\n\n\n-----\n\nAn example of a phishing site to which the victim will go. We have changed the original victim's email address to\n\nnoemail@gmail.com\n\n##### Second Vector – An SMS message\n\nThrough this vector, the victim will receive an SMS message which uses a Sender ID of 'Live Recover'\n\nand contains an alert about a stranger, who has attempted to compromise the victim's email, and the\n\nvictim has to verify it through an attached link. The link will lead to the address shortening service\n\npresented earlier. Notice that the victim in the following example has received two messages with\n\ndifferent links:\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Third Vector – Login attempt alert message\n\nThe attackers try to present a sham show about a **North Korean attacker who has attempted to**\n\ncompromise the victim's Yahoo mail. The message says that a person from North Korea has logged\n\ninto the email of the victim. In addition, the IP address of the alleged intruder is attached to the\n\nmessage (the IP is indeed North Korean), and also a button which the victim is asked to push to secure\n\ntheir account.\n\nThe first email impersonated ‘Yahoo Login Attempt’ email. Note that similar to the impersonation in the first\nvector, this email address has a profile picture with 2 letters that represent the email sender (CS for Customer\n\nservice)\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction\n\n\n-----\n\nThis victim has received another message earlier that day about a North Korean person which made\n\nchanges to the victim's account password recovery settings, so they (the victim) have to approve those\n\nchanges.\n\nThis message, like in the group's previous events, is full of errors. First, the sender's email address is a\n\nGmail address, while the approval message pretends to be a security alert from Yahoo. Second, the\n\nsentence marked in purple – \"Critical Security Alert\" – appears twice. Also, the button is changed from\n\n\"Discard Change\" in the earlier message to \"Secure Account\" in the later message; the time, date, and\n\nIP stay the same. Pressing this button will lead to an address shortening service which will lead to the\n\nphishing page:\n\n\nhxxps://bitli[.]pro/B7ZI_f56f7c3f\n\n\nSome of the addresses we have identified in this campaign have already been blocked.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Fourth Vector – Social Networks imperonation\n\nIn our previous report about Charming Kitten, we have discovered that they are impersonating\n\nsecurity teams of social networks in order to get authentication factors. Unlike the previous cases, this\n\ngroup has acted mostly against email boxes. In the group's activity since July-August, we have\n\nidentified a shift towards social networks, such as Instagram.\n\nAs a part of our monitoring of suspicious activity, we have discovered this week that the group has\n\nbuilt additional phishing sites, pretending to be not only Instagram but also Facebook and Twitter. In\n\none of the sites of the infrastructure, discovered by us, w3-schools[.]org, we have found an open\n\ndirectory at port 80 which contains files relevant for the deployment of different phishing sites.\n\n_Note that the domains that are presented in the directory are related to the impersonation subject_\n\n_and not the malicious domain._\n\nAs seen from the picture, the first uploaded files were Facebook and Twitter impersonations.\n\nImpersonations of Instagram, Google, and the National Iranian-American Council (and Iranian\n\norganization sitting in the US), were uploaded later. At every such site directory, there is a ZIP file with\n\na ready infrastructure for a phishing site:\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction\n\n\n-----\n\nAs it reads from the ZIP files, the attackers prepare their phishing sites with WordPress and\n\nCrunchPress interfaces. Every folder contains relevant files, such as logos, persons to impersonate (for\n\ninstance, one Nooshin Sadegh-Samimi[5], and Iranian who has joined NAIC in February 2019 and works\n\nas an organizing fellow) etc.\n\n5 https://www.niacouncil.org/about-niac/staff-board/nooshin-sadegh-samimi/\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction\n\n\n-----\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Digital Infrastructure\n\nThrough a pivot we have conducted on the main domain that we have identified in our research we\n\nhave found more than eight new and unknown domains, all of which bear the '.site' TLD. For instance:\n\n\ncustomers-recovery[.]site\n\n\ncom-verifications[.]site\n\n\ncom-session[.]site\n\n\nEach of these domains resolves to a different IP, yet almost all of them point – through DNS research\n\n– at the same Nameserver - ns11025[.]ztomy[.]com:\n\nWe have succeeded to identify the new domains through this Nameserver.\n\nAs we pointed out, we identified a step up in the recent campaign regarding the targeting of Yahoo\n\naccounts. The group has acted in the past, in 2017, to acquire the usernames and passwords for those\n\naccounts, yet it seems that in the recent years it has moved its focus to Google accounts. In this\n\nresearch, we found that the threat actor focuses again in Yahoo accounts and impersonation to Yahoo\n\nservices. Below an example to an URL address of one of the group's phishing sites which depicts an\n\nimpersonation to Yahoo services such as YMail.\n\n\nhxxps://mobiles.com-identifier[.]site/ymail/secureLogin/challenge/url?ucode=d105ad2b-2f7d-4193\n\na303-03eb32967133&service=mailservice&type=password\n\n\nIn our previous report we uncovered a server-registered method which in, the malicious server will\n\nredirect the client from the phishing website to the original website (HTTP 302 in port 442 or 301 in\n\nport 80). In this time too it has set its server in a way that redirects to the original Yahoo site, if a not\ndedicated (i.e. specifically authorized) entrance is attempted.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction\n\n\n-----\n\nA redirection to Yahoo services identified in Charming Kitten servers leveraged to impersonate Yahoo\n\nUnlike our previous research efforts, this time we have succeeded in finding those servers before the\n\nredirect, so the 302 protocol appears as 'found'. Additionally, this time the group uses a self-signed\n\ndigital certificate for its phishing sites.\n\nAs a part of Clearsky monitoring on DNS changes of suspicious and malicious infrastructure, we have\n\nidentified phishing domains that impersonate Microsoft services, part of which were exposed by\n\nMicrosoft[6]. On March 2019, Microsoft filed an official complaint against Phosphorus (known as\n\nCharming Kitten), which includes 99 websites targeting Microsoft users. Clearsky has been monitoring\n\nthis infrastructure and identified several changes, such as new suspicious domains and new IPs.\n\n6 [https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/03/27/new-steps-to-protect-customers-from-](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/03/27/new-steps-to-protect-customers-from-hacking/)\n[hacking/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/03/27/new-steps-to-protect-customers-from-hacking/)\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction\n\n\n-----\n\nThis photo presents one of these DNS changes within the malicious infrastructure. The domain\n\n‘identifier-activities[.]info’ moved from one IP to another and the NS of it changed to the malicious NS\n\n‘ns2[.]microsoftinternetsafety[.]net’. This domain is currently resolved to the IP address\n\n40.112.253[.]185.\n\nFollowing a Maltego graph summarized the changes in the infrastructure:\n\nThis IP address currently resolves two highly suspicious domains that are attributed to the group –\n\n‘login-gov[.]info’, and broadcastnews[.]pro’. We assess with a medium level of certainty that the\n\ndomains may be utilized for the continuation of the campaign against governmental entities in the\n\nUS, and against journalists, respectively.\n\nMoreover, under this IP we identified the domain ‘bahaius[.]info’ which impersonates to the official\n\nwebsites of the Bahais in the United States of America, ‘bahai.us’.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Indicators of Compromise\n\nmy[.]en-gb[.]home-access[.]online\n\nnotification-accountservice[.]com\n\nrecovery-services[.]info\n\nrecoverysuperuser[.]info\n\nsee-us[.]info\n\nsessions-identifier-memberemailid[.]network\n\nsmarttradingfast[.]com\n\nsystem-services[.]site\n\ntelagram[.]net\n\nuploaddata[.]info\n\nverification-services[.]info\n\n40[.]112[.]253[.]185\n\n91[.]109[.]22[.]53\n\n136[.]243[.]195[.]229\n\n178[.]32[.]58[.]182\n\n185[.]177[.]59[.]240\n\n46[.]166[.]151[.]209\n\n51[.]68[.]200[.]126\n\n51[.]89[.]229[.]215\n\n51[.]255[.]157[.]110\n\n181[.]177[.]59[.]240\n\n\nbahaius[.]info\n\nbailment[.]org\n\ncom-activities[.]site\n\ncom-identifier[.]site\n\ncom-session[.]site\n\ncom-verifications[.]site\n\ncustomers-activities[.]site\n\ncustomers-recovery[.]site\n\ncustomers-reminder[.]info\n\ndocumentsfilesharing[.]cloud\n\ndocument-sharing[.]online\n\ngomyfiles[.]info\n\nidentifier-activities[.]info\n\nidentifier-activities[.]online\n\nidentity-verification-service[.]info\n\ninbox-drive[.]info\n\ninbox-sharif[.]info\n\nmagic-delivery[.]info\n\nmicrosoftinternetsafety[.]net\n\nmobilecontinue[.]network\n\nmobile-messengerplus[.]network\n\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction\n\n\n-----\n\n### ClearSky Cyber Intelligence Report\n\n\nPhoto by 42 North on Unsplash\nhttps://unsplash.com/photos/OE7H8Zp1\n\nmw8\n\n\n###### 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.
