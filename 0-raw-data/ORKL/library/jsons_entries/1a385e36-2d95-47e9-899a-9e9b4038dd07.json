    "plain_text": "# CrowdStrike  Putter Panda Intelligence  Report\n\n##### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n\n-----\n\nIn May 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice charged five Chinese nationals for economic espionage against U.S.\ncorporations. The five known state actors are officers in Unit 61398 of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA). In\nresponse, the Chinese government stated that the claims were “absurd” and based on “fabricated facts”. China then went\neven further, stating “The Chinese government, the Chinese military and their relevant personnel have never engaged or\nparticipated in cyber theft of trade secrets.”\n\nWe believe that organizations, be they governments or corporations, global or domestic, must keep up the pressure and hold\nChina accountable until lasting change is achieved. Not only did the U.S. Government offer in its criminal indictment the\nfoundation of evidence designed to prove China’s culpability in electronic espionage, but also illustrated that the charges\nare only the tip of a very large iceberg. Those reading the indictment should not conclude that the People’s Republic of\nChina (PRC) hacking campaign is limited to five soldiers in one military unit, or that they solely target the United States\ngovernment and corporations. Rather, China’s decade-long economic espionage campaign is massive and unrelenting.\nThrough widespread espionage campaigns, Chinese threat actors are targeting companies and governments in every\npart of the globe.\n\nAt CrowdStrike, we see evidence of this activity first-hand as our services team conducts Incident Response investigations\nand responds to security breaches at some of the largest organizations around the world. We have first-hand insight into the\nbillions of dollars of intellectual property systematically leaving many of the largest corporations - often times unbeknownst\nto their executives and boards of directors.\n\nThe campaign that is the subject of this report further points to espionage activity outside of Unit 61398, and reveals\nthe activities of Unit 61486. Unit 61486 is the 12th Bureau of the PLA’s 3rd General Staff Department (GSD) and is\nheadquartered in Shanghai, China. The CrowdStrike Intelligence team has been tracking this particular unit since 2012,\nunder the codename PUTTER PANDA, and has documented activity dating back to 2007. The report identifies Chen Ping,\naka cpyy, and the primary location of Unit 61486.\n\nThis particular unit is believed to hack into victim companies throughout the world in order to steal corporate trade\nsecrets, primarily relating to the satellite, aerospace and communication industries. With revenues totaling $189.2 billion\nin 2013, the satellite industry is a prime target for espionage campaigns that result in the theft of high-stakes intellectual\nproperty. While the gains from electronic theft are hard to quantify, stolen information undoubtedly results in an improved\ncompetitive edge, reduced research and development timetables, and insight into strategy and vulnerabilities of the\ntargeted organization.\n\nParts of the PUTTER PANDA toolset and tradecraft have been previously documented, both by CrowdStrike, and in open\nsource, where they are referred to as the MSUpdater group. This report contains details on the tactics, tools, and techniques\nused by PUTTER PANDA, and provides indicators and signatures that can be leveraged by organizations to protect\nthemselves against this activity. Our Global Intelligence Team actively tracks and reports on more than 70 espionage groups,\napproximately half of which operate out of China and are believed to be tied to the Chinese government. This report is part\nof our extensive intelligence library and was made available to our intelligence subscribers in April 2014, prior to the\nUS Government’s criminal indictment and China’s subsequent refusal to engage in a constructive dialog.\n\nTargeted economic espionage campaigns compromise technological advantage, diminish global competition, and ultimately\nhave no geographic borders. We believe the U.S. Government indictments and global acknowledgment and awareness\nare important steps in the right direction. In support of these efforts, we are making this report available to the public to\ncontinue the dialog around this ever-present threat.\n\nGeorge Kurtz\n_President/CEO & Co-Founder, CrowdStrike_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n\n###### Table of Contents:\n\n\nExecutive summary....................................................................................................................... 4\n\nKey Findings........................................................................................................................................5\n\nattribution....................................................................................................................................... 7\n\nC2 Indicators...................................................................................................................................8\n\nTargeting.......................................................................................................................................10\n\nConnections to Other Adversary Groups..................................................................................11\n\n“CPYY”................................................................................................................................................12\n\n711 Network Security Team.........................................................................................................16\n\nMilitary Connections....................................................................................................................17\n\nUnit 61486..........................................................................................................................................20\n\nBinary Indicators..........................................................................................................................24\n\nconclusions...................................................................................................................................25\n\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS...................................................................................................................... 27\n\n3PARA RAT..........................................................................................................................................28\n\nPNGDOWNER....................................................................................................................................33\n\nHTTPCLIENT.........................................................................................................................................34\n\nDROPPERS -

The attribution provided in this report\n\n points to Chen Ping, aka cpyy (born on May 29, 1979), as an individual responsible for the domain\n\n registration for the Command and Control (C2) of PUTTER PANDA malware. In addition to cpyy, the\n\n report identifies the primary location of Unit 61486.\n\n PUTTER PANDA is a determined adversary group, conducting intelligence-gathering operations\n\n targeting the Government, Defense, Research, and Technology sectors in the United States, with\n\n specific targeting of the US Defense and European satellite and aerospace industries. The PLA’s GSD\n\n Third Department is generally acknowledged to be China’s premier Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)\n\n collection and analysis agency, and the 12th Bureau Unit 61486, headquartered in Shanghai,\n\n supports China’s space surveillance network.\n\n Domains registered by Chen Ping were used to control PUTTER PANDA malware. These domains were\n\n registered to an address corresponding to the physical location of the Shanghai headquarters of\n\n 12th Bureau, specifically Unit 61486. The report illuminates a wide set of tools in use by the actors,\n\n including several Remote Access Tools (RATs). The RATs are used by the PUTTER PANDA actors to\n\n conduct intelligence-gathering operations with a significant focus on the space technology sector.\n\n This toolset provides a wide degree of control over a victim system and can provide the \n\n opportunity to deploy additional tools at will. They focus their exploits against popular productivity\n\n applications such as Adobe Reader and Microsoft Office to deploy custom malware through\n\n targeted email attacks.\n\n This report contains additional details on the tactics, tools, and techniques used by PUTTER PANDA,\n\n and provides indicators and signatures that can be leveraged by organizations to protect\n\n themselves against this activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n KEY FINDINGS\n\n\n###### ➔ \u0007Putter Panda is a cyber espionage actor that conducts operations from Shanghai, China, likely on behalf of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) 3rd General Staff Department 12th Bureau Unit 61486. This unit is supports the space based signals intelligence (SIGINT) mission.\n\n ➔ \u0007The 12th Bureau Unit 61486, headquartered in Shanghai, is widely accepted to be China’s primary SIGINT collection and analysis agency, supporting China’s space surveillance network.\n\n ➔ \u0007This is a determined adversary group, conducting intelligence- gathering operations targeting the Government, Defense, Research,  and Technology sectors in the  United States, with specific  targeting of space, aerospace,  and communications.\n\n\n###### ➔ \u0007The group has been operating since at least 2007 and has been observed heavily targeting the US Defense and European satellite and aerospace industries.\n\n ➔ \u0007\u0007 They focus their exploits against popular productivity applications such as Adobe Reader and Microsoft Office to deploy custom malware through targeted email attacks.\n\n ➔ \u0007CrowdStrike identified Chen Ping, aka cpyy, a suspected member of the PLA responsible for procurement of the domains associated with operations conducted by Putter Panda.\n\n ➔ \u0007There is infrastructure overlap with Comment Panda, and evidence  of interaction between actors tied  to both groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n Attribution\n#### There are several pieces of evidence to indicate that the activity tracked by CrowdStrike as PUTTER PANDA is attributable to a set of actors based in China, operating on behalf of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Specifically, an actor known as cpyy (Chen Ping) appears to have been involved in a number of historical PUTTER PANDA campaigns, during which time he was likely working in Shanghai within the 12th Bureau, 3rd General Staff Department (GSD). PUTTER PANDA has several connections to actors and infrastructure tied to COMMENT PANDA, a group previously attributed to Unit 61398 of the PLA.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n C2 Indicators\n\nAlthough some of the domains used\n\nfor command and control of the tools\n\ndescribed later in this report appear\n\nto be legitimate sites that have been\n\ncompromised in some way, many of\n\nthem appear to have been originally\n\nregistered by the operators. Table\n\n1 shows the domains that appear\n\nto have been registered by these\n\nactors, and the original email address\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n C2 Indicators (cont’d)\n\nThe most significant finding is that an actor known as cpyy appears to have registered a significant number\n\nof C2 domains. This actor is discussed in the next section.\n\nMany of the domains have had their registrant information changed, likely in an attempt to obfuscate the\n\nidentity of the operators. For instance, several domains originally registered by cpyy had their email address\n\nupdated to van.dehaim@gmail.com around the end of 2009; for siseau.com the change occurred between\n\nJuly 2009 and November 2009, and for vssigma.com, the change occurred between August 2009 and\n\nDecember 2009. Historical registrant information for anfoundation.us, rwchateau.com, and succourtion.org\n\nwas not available prior to 2010, but it is likely that these domains were also originally registered to a personally\n\nattributable email account.\n\nSimilarly, several domains registered to\n\nmike.johnson_mj@yahoo.com have had\n\ntheir registrant email updated during March\n\n2014 (see Table 2).\n\nThese registrant changes may indicate\n\nan increased awareness of operational\n\nsecurity (OPSEC) from the PUTTER PANDA\n\nactors. The recent changes to the domains\n\nshown in Table 2 may indicate that the\n\nTable 2. New\nRegistrant Email operators are preparing new campaigns\nAddresses for that make use of this infrastructure, or they\nDomains Original\nare attempting to disassociate all these\n\nly Registered to\nmike.johnson_mj@\nyahoo.com Although no attributable information was\n\nfound on the email addresses associated\n\nwith the domains described above (aside\n\nfrom cpyy and httpchen – see below),\n\nseveral other domains were found to have been registered by some of these addresses. These are shown\n\nin Table 3, and may be used for command and control of PUTTER PANDA tools. domains from a single email\n\naddress, perhaps due to OPSEC concerns or issues with the specific email account.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n C2 Indicators (cont’d)\n\n Targeting\n\nThe subdomains associated with\n\nthese domains via DNS records, along\n\nwith some of the domain names\n\nthemselves, point to some areas\n\nof interest for the PUTTER PANDA\n\noperators (see also Droppers in the\n\nfollowing Technical Analysis section):\n\n                                - Space, satellite, and remote\n\nsensing technology (particularly\n\nwithin Europe);\n\n                              - Aerospace, especially European\n\naerospace companies;\n\n                            - Japanese and European\n\ntelecommunications.\n\nIt is likely that PUTTER PANDA will\n\ncontinue to attack targets of\n\nthis nature in future intelligence\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n\n###### C2 Indicators (cont’d)\n\n Connections to Other Adversary Groups\n\n**COMMENT PANDA**\n\nBased on passive DNS records,\n\nseveral PUTTER PANDA associated\n\ndomains have resolved to IP\n\naddress 100.42.216.230:\n\n- news.decipherment.net\n\n- res.decipherment.net\n\n- spacenews.botanict.com\n\n- spot.decipherment.net\n\nAdditionally, several subdomains of\n\nujheadph.com resolved to this IP:\n\n- chs.ujheadph.com\n\n- imageone.ujheadph.com\n\n- img.ujheadph.com\n\n- klcg.ujheadph.com\n\n- naimap.ujheadph.com\n\n- neo.ujheadph.com\n\n- newspace.ujheadph.com\n\n- pasco.ujheadph.com\n\nAnother subdomain of ujheadph.com has been\n\nobserved[2] in connection with distinctive traffic\n\noriginating from the 3PARA RAT (described below),\n\nmaking it probable that this domain is\n\nalso associated with PUTTER PANDA.\n\n\nThe decipherment.net domains resolved to this IP\n\naddress from 11 October 2012 to at least 25 February\n\n2013, and the botanict.com domain resolved from 11\n\nOctober 2012 to 24 March 2013.\n\nDuring part of this timeframe (30 June 2012 - 30\n\nOctober 2012), a domain associated with COMMENT\n\nPANDA resolved to this same IP address: login.\n\naolon1ine.com. Additionally, for a brief period in April\n\n2012, update8.firefoxupdata.com also resolved to\n\nthis IP address.\n\nThe use of the same IP address during the same time\n\nsuggests that there is perhaps some cooperation or\n\nshared resources between COMMENT PANDA and\n\nPUTTER PANDA.\n\n**VIXEN PANDA**\n\nAlthough not as conclusive as the\n\nlinks to COMMENT PANDA, IP address\n\n31.170.110.163 was associated\n\nwith VIXEN PANDA domain blog.\n\nstrancorproduct.info from November to December\n\n2013. In February 2014, this IP address was also\n\nassociated with PUTTER PANDA domain ske.hfmforum.\n\ncom. While not directly overlapping, this potential\n\ninfrastructure link is interesting, as VIXEN PANDA has\n\npreviously displayed TTPs similar to COMMENT PANDA\n\n(other CrowdStrike reporting describes VIXEN PANDA\n\nmalware that extracts C2 commands embedded\n\nbetween delimiters in web content), and has\n\nextensively targeted European entities.\n\n\n2See http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZZyfzC1Y0UoJ:www.urlquery.net/report.\nphp%3Fid%3D9771458+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n “CPYY”\n\nSeveral email addresses have been associated with cpyy, who also appears to use the alternate handles\n\ncpiyy and cpyy.chen:\n\n- cpyy@sina.com\n\n- cpyy@hotmail.com\n\n- cpyy.chen@gmail.com\n\n- cpyy@cpyy.net\n\nThe cpyy.net domain lists “Chen Ping” as the registrant name, which may be cpyy’s real name, as this\n\ncorrelates with the initials “cp” in “cpyy”. A personal blog for cpyy was found at http://cpiyy.blog.163.com/.\n\nThe profile on this blog (shown in Figure 2 below) indicates that the user is male, was born on 25 May 1979,\n\nand works for the “military/police” (其他- 军人/警察).\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n “CPYY” (cont’d)\n\nThis blog contains two postings in the “IT” category that indicate at least a passing interest in the topics of\n\nnetworking and programming. A related CSDN profile for user cpiyy indicates that cpyy was working on or\n\nstudying these topics in 2002 and 2003[3].\n\nAnother personal blog for cpyy (http://www.tianya.cn/1569234/bbs) appears to have last been updated in\n\n2007. This states that the user lives in Shanghai, and has a birthdate identical to that in the 163.com blog.\n\ncpyy was also active on a social networking site called XCar, stating that he lived in Shanghai as early as\n\n2005 through 2007; he said in a post, “Soldier’s duty is to defend the country, as long as our country is safe,\n\nour military is excellent”[4], indicating a feeling of patriotism that could be consistent with someone who\n\nchose a military or police-based career.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n “CPYY” (cont’d)\n\nOn the XCar forum, cpyy.chen used a subforum\ncalled POLO (hacker slang for “Volkswagen cars”)\nto communicate with other users Linxder, peggycat,\n“Naturally do not understand romance” (天生不懂浪漫),\n“a wolf” (一只大灰狼), “large tile” (大瓦片), “winter” (\n冬夜), “chunni” (春妮), papaya, kukuhaha, Cranbing,\n“dusty sub” (多尘子), z11829, “ice star harbor” (冰星港),\n“polytechnic Aberdeen” (理工仔), “I love pineapple\npie” (我爱菠罗派), and “she’s distant” in 2007. Although\nsuperficially the discussion is about cars, there is a\nrepeated word in the text, “milk yellow package” or\n“custard package” or “yoke package” (奶黄包). This\ncould be a hacker slang word, but it is unclear as to the\ndefinition. The conversation alludes to Linxder being the\n“teacher” or “landlord” and the other aforementioned\nusers are his “students”. Linxder references how he has\n“found jobs” for them. It is possible that this is a reference\nto hacking jobs wrapped up in car metaphors.\n\nLinxder is the handle of an actor associated with\nthe likely Shanghai-based COMMENT PANDA group[5]\n. Linxder, cpyy, and xiaobai have all discussed\nprogramming and security related topics on cpyy’s site,\ncpyy.org[6], which hosted a discussion forum for the 711\nNetwork Security Team (see below).\n\ncpyy also appears to have a keen interest in\nphotography; his 163.com blog includes several\nphotographs taken by cpyy in the blog postings and\nalbums section. Some of these photographs also appear\nin a Picasa site[7] (examples are shown in Figures 5 and 6)\nbelonging to a user cpyy.chen.\n\nAn album in this site named “me” has several shots of\nwhat is likely cpyy himself, from 2005, 2006, and 2007,\nshown to the right:\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n “CPYY” (cont’d)\n\nAn account on rootkit.com, a popular low-level software security site, existed for user cpyy and was accessed\n\nin at least May 2004. This account was registered with primary email address cpyy@cpyy.net and backup email\n\naddress cpyy@hotmail.com; it listed a date of birth as 24 May 1979, consistent with cpyy’s other profiles. The\n\nIP address 218.242.252.214 was associated with this account; it is owned by the Oriental Cable Network Co.,\n\nLtd., an ISP located in Shanghai. Registration on this forum shows that cpyy had an interest in security-related\n\nprogramming topics, which is backed up by the postings on his personal blog and CSDN account.\n\nFigure 6.

Both of these services were apparently run by the 711 Network Security Team (711网络安全小组), a\ngroup that is now likely defunct, but has previously published security-based articles that have been re-posted\non popular Chinese hacking sites such as xfocus.net[8].\n\nOne of these articles, entitled “IMD-based packet\nfiltering firewall to achieve the principles”[9], is\napparently authored by xiaobai, with email address\nxiaobai@openfind.com.cn; it was published on\nthe “GRATEFUL” (饮水思源) security digest list[10] that\nis hosted by Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).\nThis digest list/bulletin board was also frequented\nby ClassicWind, an actor possibly linked to the\nShanghai-based, PLA-sponsored adversary group\nCOMMENT PANDA, as described in. This Tipper also\nindicates that “the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\nand the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aggressively\ntarget SJTU and its School of Information Security\nEngineering (SISE) as a source of research and\nstudent recruitment to conduct network offense\nand defense campaigns”, so it is possible that the\n\nFigure 7. httpchen\n\n711 Network Security Team members came to the\n\nPosting on SJTU\n\nattention of the Chinese state via this institution.\n\n“GRATEFUL” BBS\n\nAn additional connection to SJTU comes from\na C2 domain, checalla.com, used with the 4H RAT in 2008. This domain was registered to httpchen@gmail.\ncom at the time, and this address was also used to make a posting on the GRATEFUL BBS (shown in Figure 7).\nThe posting indicates that httpchen is located at the 闵行 (Minhang) campus of SJTU and was posting using\nIP address 58.196.156.15, which is associated with the China Education and Research Network (CERNET), a\nnationwide network managed by the Chinese Ministry of Education. It also states that httpchen is studying at\nthe school of Information Security Engineering within SJTU.\n\n8For example, hxxp://www.xfocus.net/articles/200307/568.html\n\n9This article also lists http://cpyy.vicp.net/ as the original source site, although no archived content could be recovered for this.\n\n10See http://bbs.sjtu.edu.cn/bbsanc,path,/groups/GROUP_3/Security/D44039356/D69C6D2AC/D4C11F438/D6DB67E4E/DA69FF663/\nM.1052844461.A.html\n\n\nFigure 7. httpchen\nPosting on SJTU\n“GRATEFUL” BBS\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n “CPYY” (cont’d)\n\n Military Connections\n\nSeveral pieces of evidence indicate that cpyy probably has connections to, or is part of, the Chinese military\n\n– specifically the PLA Army. In addition to his declaration on his personal blog that he works for the “military/\n\npolice”, and contacts with actors such as Linxder that have been previously associated with hacking units\n\nwithin the PLA, cpyy’s Picasa site contains several photographs that hint at military connections.\n\nFirst, a monochrome picture from\n\nthe 大学时代 (“college”) album\n\nposted in February 2007 shows\n\nseveral uniformed individuals:\n\nIt is not clear whether this picture\n\nincludes cpyy, or just friends/\n\nassociates/relatives.\n\nA picture from the 中学时代\n(“high school”) album posted in\nFebruary 2007 shows a male –\nlikely cpyy based on the clothing\nshown in the second picture,\nwhich matches the pictures of\ncpyy shown above – performing\nexercise in front of a group of\nlikely soldiers and an officer:\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\nAlthough somewhat unclear, pictures from the album 2002年的生日 (“2002 birthday”), also posted in\n\nFebruary 2007, show the celebrant (likely cpyy) in khaki clothes that are possibly military wear.\n\nThe most compelling pictures,\n\nhowever, are found in the 宿舍\n\nand 办公室 albums (“dormitory”\n\nand “office”). A shot of probably\n\ncpyy’s dormitory room shows in the\n\nbackground two military hats that\n\nappear to be Type 07 PLA Army\n\nofficer peak hats:\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\nThis album also contains a shot of the exterior of a building with several large satellite dishes outside:\n\nThis same building and the\nsatellite dishes also appear\nin the “office” album. The\nreflection effects observed\non the windows of this\nbuilding could be due to\ncoatings applied to resist\neavesdropping via laser\nmicrophones and to increase\nprivacy, which would be\nconsistent with a military\ninstallation conducting\nsensitive work.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\nAbove is an image from the same album of what appears to be a larger dish, in front of the Oriental Pearl\n\nTower, a significant landmark in Shanghai:\n\n###### UNIT 61486\nAs mentioned above, checalla.com was used for command and control with the PUTTER PANDA 4H RAT in\n2008.

Panoramio\n(left) and cpyy\nImages Compared\n\nAccording to a public report[15] on the Chinese PLA’s General Staff Department (GSD), the 12th Bureau of\nthe 3rd GSD is headquartered in the Zhabei district of Shanghai and “appears to have a functional mission\ninvolving satellites, likely inclusive of intercept of satellite communications and possibly space-based SIGINT\ncollection”. The same report also lists a Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD) of 61486 for this bureau.\n\nA webpage[16] published on a Chinese government site detailing theatrical performances involving members\nof the PLA lists an address of “闸北区粤秀路46号” (46 Yue Xiu Road, Zhabei District) for “总参61486部队” (61486\nForces General Staff). A search for this location shows an identical area to that shown in Figure 8.\n\nIt can therefore be concluded with high confidence that the location shown in cpyy’s imagery, along\nwith the satellite images above, is the headquarters of the 12th Bureau, 3rd GSD, Chinese PLA – also\nknown as Unit 61486. This unit’s suspected involvement in “space surveillance”[17] and “intercept of satellite\ncommunications” fits with their observed targeting preferences for Western companies producing\ntechnologies in the space and imaging/remote sensing sectors. The size and number of dishes present in\nthe area is also consistent with these activities.\n\n15http://project2049.net/documents/pla_third_department_sigint_cyber_stokes_lin_hsiao.pdf\n\n16http://www.dfxj.gov.cn/xjapp/wtzyps/wtlzy/wyyjysl/zhc/zyc/bd01d910153ffb4d0115a7c12f70042e.html\n\n17http://project2049.net/documents/china_electronic_intelligence_elint_satellite_developments_easton_stokes.pdf\n\n\nFigure 11.

A build time analysis of all known samples is shown in Figure 1 below, relative to China time.\n\nFigure 1. Build\nTime Analysis of\nPUTTER PANDA\nMalware, Relative\nto China Time\n(UTC+8)\n\nAlthough this shows that there is some bias in the build time distribution to daylight or working hours in China, which\n\nis more significant if a possible three-shift system of hours is considered (0900-1200, 1400-1700, and 2000-2300), this\n\nevidence is not conclusive. There is also some evidence that build times are manipulated by the adversary; for\n\nexample, the sample with MD5 hash bc4e9dad71b844dd3233cfbbb96c1bd3 has a build time of 18 July 2013, but was\n\nsupposedly first submitted to VirusTotal on 9 January 2013. This shows that the attackers – at least in 2013 – were aware\n\nof some operational security considerations and were likely taking deliberate steps to hide their origins.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n Conclusions There is strong evidence to tie cpyy, an actor who appears to have been involved in historical PUTTER PANDA operations, to the PLA army and a location in Shanghai that is operated by the 12th Bureau, 3rd GSD of the PLA (Unit 61486). Another actor tied to this activity, httpchen, has declared publically that he was attending the School of Information Security Engineering at SJTU. This university has previously been posited as a recruiting ground for the PLA to find personnel for its cyber intelligence gathering units, and there is circumstantial evidence linked cpyy to other actors based at SJTU.\n\n Given the evidence outlined above, CrowdStrike attributes the PUTTER PANDA group to PLA Unit 61486 within Shanghai, China with high confidence. It is likely that this organization is staffed in part by current or former students of SJTU, and shares some resources and direction with PLA Unit 61398 (COMMENT PANDA).\n\n\n-----\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n Technical Analysis\n\n Several RATs are used by PUTTER PANDA. The most common of these, the 4H RAT and the 3PARA RAT, have been documented previously by CrowdStrike in previous CrowdStrike Intelligence reporting. This analysis will be revisited below, along with an examination of two other PUTTER PANDA tools: pngdowner and httpclient. Two droppers have been associated with the PUTTER PANDA toolset; these are also briefly examined below.\n\n 4H RAT – EXAMPLE MD5 HASH A76419A2FCA12427C887895E12A3442B\n\nThis RAT was first analyzed by CrowdStrike in April 2012, but a historical analysis shows that it has been in\nuse since at least 2007 by the PUTTER PANDA actors. A listing of metadata for known samples, including C2\n\nScreenshot of Truecaller\n\ninformation, is shown in Appendix 1.\n\nDatabase Shared by\n\n\nDEADEYE JACKAL on Their\n\nThe operation of this RAT is described in detail in other CrowdStrike reporting, but is useful to revisit here to Twitter Account (names\nhighlight the characteristics of the RAT: redacted)\n\n- C2 occurs over HTTP, after connectivity has been verified by making a distinctive request (to the URI /\nsearch?qu= at www.google.com).\n\n- A victim identifier is generated from the infected machine’s hard disk serial number, XOR’ed with the key\nldd46!yo, and finally nibble-wise encoded as upper-case ASCII characters in the range (A-P) – e.g., the\nbyte value 0x1F becomes “BP”.\n\n- A series of HTTP requests characterizes the RAT’s C2. The initial beacon uses a request with four parameters\n(h1, h2, h3, and h4) – as shown in Figure 8 – to register the implant with the C2 server.\n\n- Communication to and from the C2 server is obfuscated using a 1-byte XOR with the key 0xBE.\n\n- The commands supported by the RAT enable several capabilities, including:\no Remote shell\n\u0007o Listing of running processes (including loaded modules)\no Process termination (specified by PID)\no File and directory listing\no File upload, download, deletion, and timestamp modification\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\nFigure 8. 4H RAT\nExample Beacon\n\nScreenshot of Truecaller\n\nDatabase Shared by\n\nDEADEYE JACKAL on Their\n\nFigure 9. Sample\n\nTwitter Account (names\n\nPython Code to\n\nredacted)\n\nDecode Hostname\nfrom User-Agent\nSnippet\n###### 3PARA RAT – EXAMPLE MD5 HASH BC4E9DAD71B844DD3233CFBBB96C1BD3\n\nThe 3PARA RAT was described in some detail in other CrowdStrike reporting, which\nexamined a DLL-based sample with an exported filename of ssdpsvc.dll. Other\nobserved exported filenames are msacem.dll and mrpmsg.dll, although the RAT has\nalso been observed in plain executable (EXE) format.\n\nOn startup, the RAT attempts to create a file mapping named\n&*SDKJfhksdf89*DIUKJDSF&*sdfsdf78sdfsdf. This is used to prevent multiple instances of\nthe RAT being executed simultaneously. The RAT will then use a byte-wise subtractionbased algorithm (using a hard-coded modulo value) to decode C2 server details\nconsisting of a server hostname and port number, in this example nsc.adomhn.\ncom, port 80. The decoding algorithm is illustrated in Figure 10 below. The key and\nmodulo values vary on a per-sample basis. Decoded C2 settings, along with sample\nmetadata, are listed in Appendix 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\nFigure 10. Sample\nPython Code Illustrating C2 Server\nDecoding Routine\nThe RAT is programmed in C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio, and it makes use of the\nobject-oriented and parallel programming features of this environment; Standard\nTemplate Library (STL) objects are used to represent data structures such as strings and\nlists, and custom objects are used to represent some of the C2 command handlers\n(e.g., CCommandCMD). Several threads are used to handle different stages of the\nC2 protocol, such as receiving data from the server, decrypting data, and processing\ncommands. Standard Windows primitives such as Events are used to synchronize\nacross these threads, with a shared global structure used to hold state.\n\nOnce running, the RAT will load a binary representation of a date/time value[13] from a Screenshot of Truecaller\nfile C:\\RECYCLER\\restore.dat, and it will sleep until after this date/time has passed. This Database Shared by\nprovides a mechanism for the operators to allow the RAT to remain dormant until a DEADEYE JACKAL on Their\nfixed time, perhaps to allow a means of regaining access if other parts of their toolset Twitter Account (names\nare removed from a victim system. redacted)\n\n\nAs with the 4H RAT, the C2 protocol used by the 3PARA RAT is HTTP based, using\nboth GET and POST requests. An initial request is made to the C2 server (illustrated\nin Figure 11 above), but the response value is effectively ignored; it is likely that this\nrequest serves only as a connectivity check, as further C2 activity will only occur\nif this first request is successful. In this case, the RAT will transmit some basic victim\ninformation to the C2 server along with a 256-byte hash of the hard-coded string\nHYF54&%9&jkMCXuiS. It is likely that this request functions as a means to authenticate\nthe RAT to the C2 server and register a new victim machine with the controller. A\nsample request and its structure are shown in Figure 12.\n\n13Using the standard Windows SYSTEMTIME structure\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\nScreenshot of Truecaller\n\nDatabase Shared by\n\nDEADEYE JACKAL on Their\n\nTwitter Account (names\n\nredacted)\n\nFigure 12. Sample\n3PARA RAT Secondary Beacon/\nC2 Registration\n\n14See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb759853(v=vs.85).aspx for details of this API, which is rarely used.\n\n\nScreenshot of Truecaller\n\nDatabase Shared by\n\nDEADEYE JACKAL on Their\n\nTwitter Account (names\n\nredacted)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\nIf this request is also successful, the RAT will attempt to retrieve tasking from the\ncontroller using a further distinctive HTTP request shown in Figure 13, repeating this\n\nScreenshot of Truecaller\n\nrequest every two seconds until valid tasking is returned.\n\nDatabase Shared by\n\n\nDEADEYE JACKAL on Their\n\n\nDEADEYE JACKAL on Their\n\nTwitter Account (names\n\nredacted)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\nReturned tasking is decrypted using the DES algorithm in CBC mode with a key derived from the MD5 hash\nof the string HYF54&%9&jkMCXuiS (as used in the secondary beacon shown above). If this fails, the RAT will fall\nback to decoding the data using an 8-byte XOR with a key derived from data returned from the HashData API\nwith the same key string. Output data produced by tasking instructions is encrypted in the same manner as it\nwas decrypted and sent back to the C2 server via HTTP POST request to a URI of the form /microsoft/errorpost/\ndefault.aspx?ID=, where the ID value is a random number in decimal representation – as with the initial request\nshown in Figure 4.\n\nThe set of commands supported by the RAT is somewhat limited, indicating that perhaps the RAT is intended\nto be used as a second-stage tool, or as a failsafe means for the attackers to regain basic access to a\ncompromised system (which is consistent with its support for sleeping until a certain date/time). Some of the\nsupported commands are implemented using C++ classes derived from a base CCommand class:\n\n - \u0007CCommandAttribe – Retrieve metadata for files on disk, or set certain attributes such as creation/\nmodification timestamps.\n - CCommandCD – Change the working directory for the current C2 session.\n - \u0007CCommandCMD – Execute a command, with standard input/output/error Screenshot of Truecaller\nredirected over the C2 channel. Database Shared by\n - CCommandNOP – List the current working directory. DEADEYE JACKAL on Their\n\n\nTwitter Account (names\n\nredacted)\n\nHowever, other commands are not implemented in this way. These other commands contain functionality to:\n\n- Pause C2 activity for a random time interval.\n- Shutdown C2 activity and exit.\n- \u0007Provide a date and time before which beaconing will not resume, recorded in the file C:\\RECYCLER\\\nrestore.dat as noted above.\n\nThe use of C++ classes that inherit from a base class to carry out some of the tasking commands, along\nwith the use of concurrency features, indicates that the developers of the RAT put some thought into the\narchitecture and design of their tool, although the decision to implement some commands outside of the\nclass-based framework is curious, and may indicate multiple developers worked on the RAT (or a single\ndeveloper with shifting preferences for his coding style).\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n PNGDOWNER – EXAMPLE MD5 HASH 687424F0923DF9049CC3A56C685EB9A5\n\nThe pngdowner malware is a simple tool constructed using Microsoft Visual Studio and implemented via single\nC++ source code file. This sample contains a PDB path of Y:\\Visual Studio 2005\\Projects\\branch-downer\\\ndowner\\Release\\downer.pdb, but other similar paths Z:\\Visual Studio 2005\\Projects\\pngdowner\\Release\\\npngdowner.pdb and Z:\\Visual Studio 2005\\Projects\\downer\\Release\\downer.pdb have also been observed\nin other samples. Appendix 3 lists metadata for known pngdowner samples.\n\nInitially, the malware will perform a connectivity check to a hard-coded URL (http://www.microsoft.com),\nusing a constant user agent Mozilla/4.0 (Compatible; MSIE 6.0;). If this request fails, the malware will attempt to\nextract proxy details and credentials from Windows Protected Storage, and from the IE Credentials Store using\npublicly known methods[15], using the proxy credentials for subsequent requests if they enable outbound HTTP\naccess. An initial request is then made to the hard-coded C2 server and initial URI – forming a URL of the form\n(in this sample) http://login.stream-media.net/files/xx11/index.asp?95027775, where the numerical parameter\nrepresents a random integer. A hard-coded user agent of myAgent is used for this request, and subsequent Screenshot of Truecaller\n\nDatabase Shared by\n\ncommunication with the C2 server.\n\nDEADEYE JACKAL on Their\n\nTwitter Account (names\n\nContent returned from this request to the C2 server will be saved to a file named index.dat in the user’s\n\nredacted)\n\ntemporary directory (i.e., %TEMP%). This file is expected to contain a single line, specifying a URL and a\nfilename. The malware will then attempt to download content from the specified URL to the filename within\nthe user’s temporary directory, and then execute this file via the WinExec API. If this execution attempt\nsucceeds, a final C2 request will be made – in this case to a URL using the same path as the initial request (and\na similarly random parameter), but with a filename of success.asp. Content returned from this request will be\nsaved to a file, but then immediately deleted. Finally, the malware will delete the content saved from the first\nrequest, and exit.\n\n\nThe limited functionality, and lack of persistence of this tool, implies that it is used only as a simple downloadand-execute utility. Although the version mentioned here uses C++, along with Visual Studios Standard\nTemplate Library (STL), older versions of the RAT (such as MD5 hash b54e91c234ec0e739ce429f47a317313), built\nin 2011, use plain C. This suggests that despite the simple nature of the tool, the developers have made some\nattempts to modify and perhaps modernize the code. Both versions contain debugging/progress messages\nsuch as “down file success”. Although these are not displayed to the victim, they were likely used by the\ndevelopers as a simple means to verify functionality of their code.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n HTTPCLIENT – EXAMPLE MD5 HASH 544FCA6EB8181F163E2768C81F2BA0B3\n\nLike pngdowner, the httpclient malware is a simple tool that provides a limited range of functionality and uses\nHTTP for its C2 channel. This malware also initially performs a connectivity check to www.microsoft.com using\nthe hard-coded user agent Mozilla/4.0 (Compatible; MSIE 6.0;), although in this variant no attempt is made to\nextract proxy credentials.\n\nThe malware will then connect to its configured C2 infrastructure (file.anyoffice.info) and perform a HTTP\nrequest of the form shown in Figure 14 below:\n\nScreenshot of Truecaller\n\nFigure 14. HttpClient\n\nDatabase Shared by\n\nSample Beacon\n\nDEADEYE JACKAL on Their\n\nTwitter Account (names\n\nredacted)\n\nContent returned from the C2 server is deobfuscated by XOR’ing the content with a single byte, 0x12. The\ndecoded data is then checked for the string runshell. If this string is not present, the C2 request is repeated\nevery 0.5 seconds. Otherwise, a shell process is started (i.e., cmd.exe), with input/output redirected over the C2\nchannel. Shell commands from the server are followed by an encoded string $$$, which indicates that the shell\nsession should continue. If the session is ended, two other commands are supported: m2b (upload file) and\nb2m (download file).\nSlight variations on the C2 URLs are used for different phases of the C2 interaction:\n\n - Shell command: /Microsoft/errorpost<random number>/default.asp?tmp=<encoded hostname>\n\n - Shell response: /MicrosoftUpdate/GetUpdate/KB<random number>/default.asp?tmp=<encoded hostname>\n\n15Both methods are detailed here: http://securityxploded.com/iepasswordsecrets.php\n\n\nScreenshot of Truecaller\n\nDatabase Shared by\n\nDEADEYE JACKAL on Their\n\nTwitter Account (names\n\nredacted)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\nGiven the lack of a persistence mechanism and low level of sophistication, it is likely that httpclient – like\npngdowner – is used as a second-stage or supplementary/backup tool. Appendix 4 lists metadata for\nobserved httpclient samples.\n\n###### DROPPERS – RC4 AND XOR BASED\n\nOther CrowdStrike reporting describes a dropper used by PUTTER PANDA (abc.scr) to install the 4H RAT. This\ndropper uses RC4 to decrypt an embedded payload from data in an embedded resource before writing the\npayload to disk and executing it. Several instances of this dropper have been observed, most commonly in\nassociation with the 4H RAT, but also in relation to other tools that will be described in forthcoming reporting.\nAnother dropper has been observed, exclusively installing the pngdowner malware (example MD5 hash\n4c50457c35e2033b3a03fcbb4adac7b7). This dropper is simplistic in nature, and is compiled from a single C++\nsource code file. It contains a Word document in plaintext (written to Bienvenue_a_Sahaja_Yoga_Toulouse.\ndoc), along with an executable (Update.exe) and DLL (McUpdate.dll). The executable and DLL are both\ncontained within the .data section of the dropper, obfuscated with a 16-byte XOR key (consisting of the bytes\n0xA0 – 0xAF). Screenshot of Truecaller\n\nDatabase Shared by\n\n\nDEADEYE JACKAL on Their\n\nBoth the document and executable are written to disk and the executed via the ShellExecute API (using the\n\nTwitter Account (names\n\nverb “open”). The executable is also installed into the ASEP registry key HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\\n\nredacted)\n\nCurrentVersion\\Run, with a value named McUpdate. Finally, the dropper deletes itself via a batch file.\nThe dropped executable (MD5 hash 38a2a6782e1af29ca8cb691cf0d29a0d) primarily aims to inject\nthe specified DLL (McUpdate.dll, MD5 hash 08c7b5501df060ccfc3aa5c8c41b452f) into a process that\nwould normally be accessing the network, likely in order to disguise the malicious activity. Module names\ncorresponding to Outlook Express (msinm.exe), Outlook (outlook.exe), Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe), and\nFirefox (firefox.exe) are used. If Internet Explorer is used, then the malware will attempt to terminate processes\ncorresponding to two components of Sophos Anti-Virus (SAVAdminService.exe and SavService.exe).\nFour examples of these droppers were located, using a mixture of decoy PDF and Microsoft Word documents\n(shown below in Figures 15-18). The common theme throughout these documents is space technology\n(Bienvenue_a_Sahaja_Yoga_Toulouse.doc does not follow this trend, but could be targeted at workers at the\nToulouse Space Centre, the “largest space centre in Europe” ), indicating that the attackers have a keen\ninterest in this sector, which is also reflected in the choice of name for some of the C2 domains used (see the\nAttribution section above).\n\n16The API used expects a parameter of the form char**, and is given a char* pointer to the “*/*” string, but the stack data following this\npointer is not properly zeroed or cleansed before use, leading to uncontrolled memory being read as other strings.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n\nScreenshot of Truecaller\n\nDatabase Shared by\n\nDEADEYE JACKAL on Their\n\n\nTwitter Account (names\n\nredacted)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mitigation & Remediation\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n MITIGATION & REMEDIATION\n### A number of specific and generic detection methods are possible for this RAT, both on a host and on the network.

With unprecedented\n\ninsight into adversary tools, tactics, and procedures\n\n(TTPs) and multi-source information channels, analysts\n\ncan identify pending attacks and automatically feed\n\nthreat intelligence via API to SIEM and thirdparty\n\nsecurity tools.\n\nAccess to CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence is geared\n\ntoward all levels of an organization, from the\n\nexecutivewho needs to understand the business threat\n\nand strategic business impact, to the front-line securiyt\n\nprofessional struggling to !ght through an adversary’s\n\nattack against the enterprise.\n\nCrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence is a web-based\n\nintelligence subscription that includes full access to a\n\nvariety of feature sets, including:\n\n- \u0007Detailed technical and strategic analysis of\n\n50+adversaries’ capabilities, indicators and\n\ntradecra!,attribution, and intentions\n\n- \u0007Customizable feeds and API for indicators of\n\ncompromise in a wide variety of formats\n\n- \u0007Tailored Intelligence that provides\n\nvisibility into breaking events that matter to\n\nan organization’s brand,\n\n\n###### Falcon  Intelligence  Benefits\n\nIncorporate Actionable Intelligence\nFeeds into your existing enterprise\nsecurity infrastructure to identify\nadvanced attackers speci!c to your\norganization and industry\n\nRapidly integrate Falcon Intelligence\ninto custom work”ows and SEIM\ndeployments with a web-based API\n\nQuickly understand the capabilities\nand artifacts of targeted attacker\ntradecra# with In-depth technical\nanalysis\n\nGain visibility into breaking events\nthat matter to an organization’s\nbrand, infrastructure, and customers\nInteract with the Intelligence team\nand leverage customized Cyber\nThreat Intelligence feedback during\n\nQuarterly Executive Brie!ngs\nProvide malware samples and\nreceive customized and actionable\nintelligence reporting\n\nAccess the Adversary Pro!le Library\nto gain in-depth information into\n50+ adversary groups, to include\ncapabilities and tradecra# and tradecraft\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n\n###### CrowdStrike Falcon Host\n\nCrowdStrike Falcon Host is an endpoint threat\n\ndetection and response product that identifies\n\nunknown malware, detects zero-day threats, and\n\nprevents damage from targeted attacks in real-time.\n\nFalcon Host is comprised of two core components,\n\nthe cloud-based management console and the\n\non-premises host-based sensor that continuously\n\nmonitors threat activity at the endpoint to prevent\n\ndamage in real-time.\n\nFalcon Host leverages a lightweight kernel-mode\n\nsensor that shadows, captures, and correlates low\nlevel operating system events to instantly identify\n\nthe adversary tradecraft and activities through\n\nStateful Execution Inspection (SEI) at the endpoint\n\nand Machine Learning in the cloud. As opposed\n\nto focusing on malware signatures, indicators of\n\ncompromise, exploits, and vulnerabilities, Falcon Host\n\ninstead identifies mission objectives of the adversary\n\nleveraging the Kill Chain model and provides realtime\n\ndetection by focusing on what the attacker is\n\ndoing, as opposed to looking nfor a specific,\n\neasily changeable indicator used in an attack.\n\nWithout performing intrusive and performance\nimpacting scans of the system, Falcon Host’s highly\n\nefficient real-time monitoring of all system activity\n\nis the only security solution that provides maximum\n\nvisibility into all adversary activities, including\n\nAdversary-in-Motion: reconnaissance, exploitation,\n\nprivilege escalation, lateral movement, and\n\nexfiltration.\n\nFalcon Host delivers insight into past and current\n\nattacks not only on a single host, but also across\n\ndevices and networks.\n\n\n###### Falcon Host Key Features\n\n- \u0007Endpoint threat detection and response solution\n\n- \u0007Cloud-managed application with easily deployed sensors for\n\nMac & Windows\n\n- \u0007Kernel-mode sensors requires no reboot on updates. Less\n\nthan 2MB footprint executable\n\n- \u0007Detects attacks based on adversary activity\n\n- \u0007Integrates with existing security architecture and SIEM tools\n\nthrough Falcon Host APIs\n\n###### Technology Drivers:  Stateful Execution inspection\n\nStateful Execution Inspection (SEI) tracks execution state and\n\nlinks together various stages of the kill chain, from initial code\n\nexecution to data exfiltration.\n\nCrowdStrike’s Real-time Stateful Execution Engine performs\n\ninspection and analysis to understand the full context of a\n\ncyber attack. SEI is critical to understanding the entire\n\nattack life cycle and preventing the damage from advanced\n\nmalware and targeted attacks. Existing security technologies\n\nthat focus solely on malware signatures, incidators of\n\ncompromise, exploits, and vulnerabilities\n\nfail to protect against the majority of attacks as they are blind\n\nto the full scope of adversary activity.\n\n###### Benefits\n\n- \u0007Identify and protect against damage from determined\n\nattackers who are undetected by existing passive\n\ndefense solutions\n\n- \u0007Understand who is attacking you, why and what they want\n\nto steal or damage\n\n- \u0007Alert and stop exfiltration of sensitive information from\n\ncompromised machines Protect remote users when they\n\nare outside of the corporate network\n\n- \u0007Protect remote users when they are outside of the\n\ncorporate network\n\n- \u0007No on-premises equipment needed, reducing overall\n\ntotal cost of ownership\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CrowdStrike Intelligence Report\n###### Crowdstrike Global Intelligence Team\n\n About CrowdStrike\n\n CrowdStrike is a global provider of security technology and services focused on\n\n identifying advanced threats and targeted attacks.
