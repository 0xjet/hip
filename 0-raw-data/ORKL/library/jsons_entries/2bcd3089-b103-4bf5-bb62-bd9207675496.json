In this article we identify another\nmember of the group.\n\n**fisherxp to baobeilong**\n\nInspection of @fisherxp’s [Twitter account shows that he follows 259 people and has 16](http://twitter.com/fisherxp)\n[followers. One particularly interesting account, @baobeilong, both follows @fisherxp and is](https://twitter.com/baobeilong)\nfollowed by it.\n\n\n-----\n\nbaobeilong’s Twitter account\n**baobeilong’s interest in APT10 tools**\n\n[‘baobeilong’ also has a GitHub account that shows a strong interest in Remote Access](https://github.com/baobeilong)\nTrojans (RATs) including QuasarRAT and Trochilus, which baobeilong forked in 2015. JPCert\n[reported in 2017 that Trochilus was used by APT10 as the basis for the RedLeaves malware.](https://blog.jpcert.or.jp/2017/04/redleaves---malware-based-on-open-source-rat.html)\nQuasarRAT was also used by APT10, as described in the FireEye blog post APT10\n[(MenuPass Group): New Tools, Global Campaign Latest Manifestation of Longstanding](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/apt10_menupass_grou.html)\nThreat.\n\nbaobeilong’s GitHub account\n**Location in Tianjin**\n\n\n-----\n\n[baobeilong has a Flickr profile including photos of family and a fire on Hualong Road in](https://www.flickr.com/photos/baobeilong/)\nTianjin.\n\nPhoto of a fire in Tianjin uploaded by baobeilong to Flickr\nAnalysis by this blog leads us to conclude that the photo of the fire may have been taken\nfrom the Wanchun Meizuan Mansion building on the corner of Hualong Road and Xinkai\nRoad in Tianjin from one of the floors occupied by flats. Readers will remember Xinkai Road\nas the address of the Laoying Baichen Instruments Equipment Co, associated with Gao\n[Qiang in our previous article.](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/?p=218)\n\n**baobeilong to xiaohong[.]org**\n\n[‘baobeilong’ also has a fanfou.com account where the user provides a website address –](http://fanfou.com/baobeilong)\nxiaohong[.]org. A [Chinese language blog also contains a posting using the e-mail address](http://www.cnblogs.com/waw/recentcomments.html?page=92)\nbaobei[at]xiaohong.org, helping to confirm the connection between ‘baobei[long]’ and the\nxiaohong[.]org domain.\n\nA user named baobeilong posting an e-mail address using the xiaohong[.]org\ndomainxiaohong[.]org to Zhang Shilong\nIn 2007, the registration details for xiaohong[.]org were Zhang Shilong, Hedong, Yuyang\nRoad No 121, Tianjin. He provided +8613116037711 as his phone number and the e-mail\naddress atreexp[at]yahoo.com.cn.\n\nThe registration details were later updated on 08/07/2008 to include fax number\n+865925163169 and then on 01/06/2016 to add phone number +8615122188031. The email address was changed at the same time to robin4700[at]foxmail.com.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Zhang Shilong to atreex[.]cn**\n\nReverse WHOIS registration information for Zhang’s e-mail address atreexp[at]yahoo.com.cn\nshows that it was also associated with the domain atreex[.]cn. The Wayback Machine shows\nthat this domain hosted a Chinese language blog relating to hacking and IT security topics\nbetween 2006 and 2007.\n\n**atreex[.]cn to fisherx[.]com**\n\nCompleting the circle back to Gao Qiang / fisherxp, an article in 2006 on the atreex[.]cn blog\nprovided a link to fisherx[.]com.\n\nLink to fisherx[.]com on a 2006 copy of atreex[.]cnThis domain, which bears a striking\nresemblance to Gao Qiang’s “fisherxp”, was registered to an address in ‘Tian Jing’ with\npostcode 300011. The same postcode as the Laoying Baichen Instruments Equipment Co,\nassociated with Gao Qiang (see previous article).\n**Zhang Shilong’s reaction to Cloud Hopper report**\n\nThe domain xiaohong[.]org is particularly interesting because on 12/04/2017, the domain\nregistration information was updated to ‘Domain Protection Services’, making it effectively\nanonymous. That date is significant – it was the week after the Cloud Hopper report on\nAPT10 was released by PwC and BAE Systems.\n\n**In summary, APT10 hacker Gao Qiang of Tianjin, China has multiple connections to**\n**Zhang Shilong, another Chinese hacker from Tianjin. Zhang Shilong has independent**\n**links to APT10 tools and made an attempt to protect his identity immediately after the**\n**2017 Cloud Hopper report.**\n\n\n-----",
