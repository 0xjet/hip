motivated intrusions, particularly against the video game industry, including\nstealing source code and digital certificates, virtual currency manipulation, and attempting\nto deploy ransomware.\n\nAPT41 has executed multiple software supply chain compromises, gaining access to\nsoftware companies to inject malicious code into legitimate files before distributing updates.\n\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nFireEye Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that APT41 is a Chinese\nstate-sponsored espionage group that is also conducting financially motivated activity for\npersonal gain.\n\nAPT41 espionage operations against the healthcare, high-tech, and telecommunications\nsectors include establishing and maintaining strategic access, and through mid-2015, the\ntheft of intellectual property.\n\nThe group's operations against higher education, travel services, and news/media firms\nprovide some indication that the group also tracks individuals and conducts surveillance.\n\nFireEye Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that APT41 carries out an array\nof financially motivated intrusions, particularly against the video game industry, including\n\n\n-----\n\n## Overview\n\nFireEye Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that APT41 is\na prolific cyber threat group that carries out Chinese state-sponsored\nespionage activity in addition to financially motivated activity potentially\noutside of state control. Activity traces back to 2012 when individual\nmembers of APT41 conducted primarily financially motivated operations\nfocused on the video game industry before expanding into likely statesponsored activity. This is remarkable because explicit financially motivated\ntargeting is unusual among Chinese state-sponsored threat groups, and\nevidence suggests these two motivations were balanced concurrently from\n2014 onward.\n\n\n-----\n\n- APT41 is unique among tracked China-based actors in\n\nthat it leverages non-public malware typically reserved\nfor espionage operations in what appears to be activity\nthat falls outside the scope of state-sponsored missions.\n\n- Based on early observed activity, consistent behavior,\n\nand APT41's unusual focus on the video game industry,\nwe believe the group's cyber crime activities are most\nlikely motivated by personal financial gain or hobbyist\ninterests.\n\nThis contrasts with the state-sponsored goals that likely\ndrive the group's healthcare, high-tech, and politically\nrelated targeting.\n\n- We believe that APT41 is highly sophisticated and\n\ninnovative. Its history of financially motivated targeting\nof the video game industry has ultimately supported the\ngroup's state-sponsored activity.\n\n\n\n- The group's distinct use of supply chain compromises to\n\ntarget select individuals, consistent use of compromised\ndigital certificates, and deployment of bootkits (rare\namong APT operators), highlight a creative and wellresourced adversary.\n\n- Some of the early operations driven by personal gain\n\nused techniques that would later be pivotal in executing\nsupply chain compromises.\n\n- Learning to access video game production environments\n\nenabled APT41 to develop the tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs) that were later leveraged against\nsoftware companies to inject malicious code into\nsoftware updates.\n\nAPT41 campaigns include most of the incidents previously\nattributed in FireEye Threat Intelligence reporting to\nGREF Team and a number of additional clusters that were\npreviously unnamed.\n\n\n-----\n\n      - Healthcare: including medical devices and diagnostics\n\n      - High-tech: including semiconductors, advanced\n\ncomputer hardware, battery technology, and electric\nvehicles\n\n      - Media: including news organizations\n\n      - Pharmaceuticals\n\n      - Retail\n\n      - Software companies: which were compromised in\n\nsupply chain operations potentially affecting large\nnumbers of victims\n\n      - Telecoms\n\n      - Travel services\n\n      - Education\n\n      - Video games: including development studios,\n\ndistributors/publishers, and activities enabling supply\nchain compromises\n\n      - Virtual currencies: including in-game currencies,\n\ncryptocurrencies, and related services\n\nAPT41 has targeted organizations in 14 countries (and\nHong Kong) over seven years, including: France, India,\nItaly, Japan, Myanmar, the Netherlands, Singapore, South\nKorea, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the\nUnited Kingdom, and the United States (Figure 1). APT41\nespionage operations against entities in these countries\nfollow targeting of verticals consistent with Chinese\nnational policy priorities.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Industries Targeted**\n\n\n**Figure 1:**\n\nCountries and\nindustries targeted\ndirectly by APT41.\n\n\nAutomotive Financial Pharmaceuticals\n\nBusiness Services Healthcare Retail\n\nCryptocurrency High-Tech Telecommunications\n\nEducation Intergovernmental Travel\n\nE M di d E t t i t\n\n\n-----\n\n## Operations Over Time\n\nThe duality of APT41's state-sponsored activity and its own cyber crime\noperations is demonstrated in the group's simultaneous operations. Throughout\nthe group’s observable history, APT41 has consistently run its own financially\nmotivated campaigns concurrently with espionage operations. In contrast,\nAPT41 espionage targeting has changed significantly over time, suggesting\nshifts in assigned missions or new contracts to complete. A breakdown of\nindustries targeted by APT41 over time can be found in Figure 2.\n\n- We believe that like other Chinese espionage operators, APT41 has moved\n\ntoward strategic intelligence collection and establishing access, but away from\ndirect intellectual property theft. This shift, however, has not affected the group's\nconsistent interest in targeting the video game industry for financially motivated\nreasons.\n\n– We have not observed evidence of IP theft since late 2015.–\n\n– In 2014, APT41 was observed carrying out espionage campaigns –\n\nconcurrently with financially motivated intrusions, demonstrating that they\ncould balance different objectives simultaneously.\n\n- Espionage operations occurred while the group was still carrying out\n\nfinancially motivated campaigns, including longer-term intrusions, which\ntypically extended for more than a year.\n\n– In one instance, APT41 was attempting to steal data from a healthcare target –\n\nwhile also attempting to deploy ransomware at a video game studio.\n\n- Compromising organizations in different sectors concurrently provides some\n\nindication that they are fulfilling specific assigned tasks.\n\n– Campaigns have expanded into additional industries including telecoms, –\n\nthe automotive sector, higher education, and travel services.\n\n– In 2015, we observed a time period in which eight organizations in six –\n\ndifferent industries were compromised simultaneously.\n\n- Since 2017, APT41's activities have included a series of supply chain\n\ncompromises. The operation injects malware into legitimate server software\npackages used by hundreds of companies worldwide but limits deployment\nof additional payloads to select targets.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2:** Timeline\nof industries\ntargeted by APT41.\n\n##### INDUSTRIES TARGETED BY APT 41\n\n###### 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\n\nVideo Game Video Game Video Game Video Game Video Game Retail Video Game\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nTelecom Telecom\n\n\nVideo Game\nRelated\n\n\nVideo Game Video Game Video Game\nRelated Related Related\n\n\nTelecom\n\n\nHi-Tech Hi-Tech Hi-Tech Hi-Tech Hi-Tech\n\nIntergovernmental Media Media Media\n\n\nHi-Tech\n\n\nHealthcare Healthcare\n\nPharmaceutical\n\n\nHealthcare\n\n\nAutomotive\n\n\nFinance\n\nTravel\n\nHealthcare\n\n\nEnergy Software Software\n\n\n-----\n\n## Cyber Espionage Activity\n\n\nObserved APT41 targeting is consistent with China's\nnational strategies to move production capabilities\nupmarket into research and development (R&D)-heavy\nfields. These initiatives were especially highlighted with\n\"Made in China 2025,\" a plan announced in 2015 that aims\nto shift China's economy toward higher value products\nand services, including pharmaceuticals, semiconductors,\nand other high-tech industries.\n\n- We assess that the targeting of high-tech firms that\n\nproduce computer components aligns with Chinese\ninterests in domestically developing high-end\n[technologies as outlined in the 12th (2011) and 13th](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/12th-FiveYearPlan_062811.pdf)\n[(2016) Five-Year plans, as well as the Made in China](https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/final_made_in_china_2025_report_full.pdf)\n2025 (2015) initiative.\n\n– Since 2013, APT41 has targeted organizations involved –\n\nin the research, development, and sale of computer\ncomponents used for machine-learning, autonomous\nvehicles, medical imaging, and the consumer market.\nThe group also targeted companies involved in\nproducing motherboards, processors, and server\nsolutions for enterprises.\n\n– In April 2013, the group targeted an enterprise –\n\ncloud-computing provider. Developing domestic\ncloud-computing technologies was a goal in the 12th\nFive-Year Plan.\n\n– In a 2014 compromise, APT41 targeted a European –\n\nconglomerate and specifically focused on systems\nphysically located in China.\n\n- The timing of multiple intrusions attributed to the group\n\nindicate a focused interest in strategic business decisions,\nincluding entry into the Chinese market, partnerships/\nM&A, and expansion into other regional markets.\n\n– In October 2017, an intrusion into a retailer targeted –\n\nstrategic investment plans at the same time as the\nfirm was beginning to negotiate a partnership with a\nChinese company (although this potential deal was\nnot publicized).\n\n– In spring 2015, APT41 targeted information related –\n\nto two entities undergoing a merger announced the\nprevious year. This included data related to a senior\nexecutive, as well as payroll and communications\nintegration issues.\n\n\n\n- Since 2017, APT41 has consistently targeted\n\ntelecommunications companies, possibly a crucial first\nstep to establish a foothold in targeting a particular region.\n\n–– Targeted telecom companies spanned several\n\ncountries, and recently identified intrusions were\nconcentrated in countries where we had not identified\nany prior APT41 activity.\n\n–– APT41 has targeted large telecom companies and\n\ntheir subsidiaries in various locations, demonstrating\nconsistent interest in obtaining access to these\ntargets.\n\n–– The group has also repeatedly targeted call record\n\ninformation at telecom companies, supporting\nindications of their wider intelligence collection efforts.\n\nIn addition to specifically targeting industries of\nstrategic value, we suggest that APT41 is also given\nmore tactical assignments, including reconnaissance and\nidentifying dissidents.\n\n- A hotel was targeted two weeks ahead of a diplomatic\n\nvisit in which high-ranking Chinese officials stayed\nthere. Personal data within the reservations system was\ndirectly accessed, suggesting the group was potentially\ntasked to reconnoiter the facility.\n\n- We assess with moderate confidence that APT41\n\ngathered intelligence on pro-democracy dissidents\nin Hong Kong based on the targets and timing of\noperations.\n\n–– In July and August 2016, APT41 sent spear-phishing\n\nemails to Hong Kong media organizations known for\npro-democracy editorial content.\n\n–– The timing and targeting of this activity suggests\n\npossible interest in the pro-democracy Umbrella\n[Movement candidates who were running for seats in](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/hong-kong-poll-pro-independence-activists-poised-to-win-seats-in-record-turnout)\nHong Kong's legislative council.\n\n–– A spear-phishing email with the subject-line \"help\"\n\nwas later sent to one of the previously targeted\norganizations in October 2017, coinciding with the\n**[sentencing of pro-democracy Occupy activists. The](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2107216/occupy-activists-joshua-wong-and-nathan-law-jailed-hong-kong)**\nruling placed a five-year ban on the activists from\nholding public offices in Hong Kong.\n\n\n-----\n\n– This was the first instance we have observed of APT41 –\n\ntargeting pro-democracy groups in Hong Kong.\n\nAPT41 frequently leverages timely news stories as the\nlure content in their spear-phishing emails, although\nsocial engineering content does not always correlate with\ntargeted users or organizations.\n\n**Figure 3:**\n\n\n\n- In 2015, APT41 targeted a Japanese media organization\n\nwith a lure document (Figure 3) titled “中東呼吸器症候\n群(MERS)の予防,” which translates to \"Prevention of\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\" The fear of\nrespiratory infections and a potential pandemic provide\nparticularly effective lure material against targets in the\nAsia-Pacific region that had first-hand experience with\nprior SARS and avian flu outbreaks.\n\n\nMERS-themed lure document leveraging for C&C (MD5: 5e87b09f9a3f1b728c9797560a38764b).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CASE STUDY\n\n## Healthcare Sector Targeting\n\nAPT41 activity aimed at medical device companies\nand pharmaceuticals is demonstrative of the group's\ncapacity to collect sensitive and highly valuable\nintellectual property (IP), although we have not observed\nevidence of IP theft since late 2015. The healthcare\nsector was targeted in a manner that is highly specific\nand most likely indicative of focused taskings from\nsponsoring organizations with a stake in the healthcare\nmarket. Targeted information included pharmaceutical\ndevelopment, clinical trial data, and intelligence\nregarding a medical subsidiary's parent company.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe targeting of these organizations just ahead of the\nrelease of products requiring a long R&D cycle can confer\na significant market advantage to a competitor. The\nobserved activities are indicative of ongoing efforts to\nsupport China's own R&D efforts in support of Made in\nChina 2025.\n\n- Between July 2014 and May 2016, APT41 targeted a\n\nmedical devices subsidiary of a large corporation.\n\n–– Although APT41 initially targeted the parent company,\n\n30 percent of the victimized hosts were related to\na subsidiary specialized in manufacturing medical\ndevices. Password strings and spoofed domains\nleveraged in the operation signify a narrow tasking\nto target the subsidiary instead of the parent\ncorporation.\n\n–– We have some indication based on the nature of hosts\n\ntargeted that APT41 was interested in information\ntechnology employees and software used by the\nmedical device subsidiary.\n\n\n–– A keylogger dubbed GEARSHIFT was first deployed at\n\nthe medical device company. A digital certificate from\nthe victim was compromised and used to sign malware\nused in an operation against a separate biotech\ncompany detailed below.\n\n- A biotech company undergoing acquisition was\n\ntargeted by APT41 in May 2015. Highly sensitive\ninformation about corporate operations, including\nhuman resources data, tax information, and acquisitionrelated documents, were targeted.\n\n–– Clinical trials data of developed drugs, academic data,\n\nand R&D funding-related documents were exfiltrated.\n\n–– The time frame, use of the same GEARSHIFT sample,\n\nand a digital certificate from the aforementioned\nmedical device company provide some indication that\nthese two campaigns were conducted by the same\noperator concurrently.\n\n- In 2018, we observed APT41 target a third healthcare\n\ncompany, although their goals during this compromise\nwere unclear.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Financially Motivated Activity\n\nUnlike other observed Chinese espionage operators, APT41 conducts explicit\nfinancially motivated activity, which has included the use of tools that are\notherwise exclusively used in campaigns supporting state interests. The latenight to early morning activity of APT41's financially motivated operations\nsuggests that the group primarily conducts these activities outside of their\nnormal day jobs. However, the group compiled malware for use in cyber crime\nactivity even during espionage-focused working hours.\n\n- As demonstrated in Figure 4, operational times for APT41 espionage\n\noperations over all observed activity are relatively close to Chinese work hours\n(in UTC +8, China's time zone).\n\n- In contrast, the group's financially motivated activity targeting the video game\n\nindustry tends to occur much later in the night.\n\nOperational times at gaming targets are most frequent between 18:00 and\n07:00 (UTC +8), providing some indication that the group is moonlighting. Note\nthat this is based on data collected over years and does not represent a daily\nschedule.\n\n- [The typical working hours in China for tech workers is a \"996\" work schedule](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/technology/china-996-jack-ma.html)\n\n(9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., six days a week), which is consistent with APT41's\noperational activity observed over time.\n\n- Operational times at targets not related to video games (and therefore, almost\n\ncertainly in support of state-sanctioned missions) are more frequent between\n14:00 and 22:00 (China Standard Time (CST), UTC +8), closer to conventional\nworking hours (Figure 4).\n\n- Analysis of compile times for all portable executable (PE) files suggests that\n\nAPT41's average working hours fall between 10:00 to 23:00 (UTC +8),\nhighlighting that the financially motivated activity is most likely extraneous\nto their espionage operations.\n\n- Compile times for samples used in suspected financial gain missions are skewed\n\ntoward later in the evening, roughly 19:00 to 00:00 (UTC +8). However, there\nis significant overlap with the compile times of PE files deployed at espionage\ntargets between 15:00 to 19:00 (UTC +8).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4:**\n\nOperational\nactivity for gaming\nversus nongaming-related\ntargeting based\non observed\noperations since\n2012.\n\n\n###### APT41 Operational Times UTC +8\n\n**0** **1** **2** **3** **4** **5** **6** **7** **8** **9** **10** **11** **12** **13** **14** **15** **16** **17** **18** **19** **20** **21** **22** **23**\n\n\nThe group has also targeted cryptocurrencies, including at\nleast one case in which there was a connection between\ncryptocurrency and an online video gaming platform.\n\n- In June 2018, APT41 sent spear-phishing emails using an\n\ninvitation lure to join a decentralized gaming platform\nlinked to a cryptocurrency service (Figure 5) that had\npositioned itself as a medium of exchange for online\ngames and gambling sites. The malicious emails were\nsent from an email address listed with the name Tom\n\n\nGiardino, which is likely a reference to an employee at\nValve, an American video game developer responsible\nfor the software distribution platform Steam and\nvarious video games. The body of the email (Figure 6)\nalso mentions gaming offerings. This provides another\nconnection between the targeting of the cryptocurrency\norganizations and video game targeting.\n\n- In October 2018, the group compiled an instance\n\nof XMRig, a Monero cryptocurrency mining tool,\ndemonstrating a continued interest in cryptocurrency.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5:**\n\nScreenshot of\ninvitation to join\nthe FairWin online\ngaming platform.\n\n**Figure 6:**\n\nEnglish translation\nof invitation to join\nthe FairWin online\ngaming platform.\n\n\nFrom: Tom Giardino < Date: <redacted>\nSubject: Project (FairWin) online application!\n\nProject Introduction:\nFairWin is a decentralized online gaming platform.\n\nBe sure to win fairness because our special FairChannel guarantees accurate RTP rates.\nThe system is based on a blockchain, which means that the gameplay process is open.

We\nbelieve these operations include broadly malicious\nactivity that can enable further operations, such as\ntargeting game source code and compromising digital\ncertificates, while other activities are explicitly financially\nmotivated, such as abusing in-game currency mechanics.\nAPT41 campaigns focused on the video game sector\nhave largely affected studios and distributors in East and\nSoutheast Asia, although global companies based in the\nUnited States have also been targeted.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group leverages many TTPs during the targeting\nof video game-related organizations, which are likewise\nemployed in their espionage operations.\n\n- Since at least 2012, APT41 has repeatedly gained access\n\nto game development environments within affected\ncompanies, including online multiplayer networks, as\nwell as targeting of production database administrators.\n\n–– The group is competent in both Linux and Windows\n\nenvironments and can pivot easily between\nboth environments within a single operation,\nincluding compromising intermediary servers that\nprovide access to separated Windows and Linux\nenvironments.\n\n–– In October 2012, APT41 used captured credentials to\n\ncompromise a jump server and access a production\nenvironment where they deployed a Linux version of\nPHOTO. Based on the machines targeted, we have\nsome indication that APT41 specifically sought to\naccess production machines used in the development\nof an upcoming online game.\n\n– In 2014, APT41 used a variant of SOGU that is capable –\n\nof connecting to Windows and Linux systems via SSH\nand Samba/CIFS.\n\n– APT41 has been observed inserting malicious code –\n\ninto legitimate video game files to distribute malware.\nIn 2018, the group inserted CRACKSHOT malware into\ngame files that were signed with legitimate codesigning certificates, most likely indicating access\nto the production environment, which facilitated a\nsupply chain compromise.\n\n§§ A highly similar incident in 2014 suggests that\n\nAPT41 (or a closely affiliated actor) has a history\nof carrying out such operations against the video\ngame industry.\n\n– APT41's experience gaining access to production –\n\nenvironments may have been a precursor to more\nrecent supply chain compromises. The insertion of\nmalware into a build environment for later distribution\nwith legitimate software is a natural extension of\nthe group's earliest activities. Additional details are\nprovided in the section \"History of Supply Chain\nCompromises.\"\n\n\n\n- We have also observed APT41 limitedly deploy rootkits\n\non Linux systems and Master Boot Record (MBR)\nbootkits, such as ROCKBOOT, on Windows systems to\nhide their malware and maintain persistence on victim\nsystems. Selective deployment of ROCKBOOT suggests\nthat APT41 reserves more advanced TTPs and malware\nonly for high-value targets.\n\n–– Bootkits are a stealthy means of installing malware\n\nbecause the code resides outside of the OS. Because\nbootkits are initialized prior to the OS and operate in\nkernel mode, OS applications and security tools may\nhave great difficulty detecting bootkits.\n\n–– The use of bootkits among threat actors, however,\n\nis rare. It is more common for threat actors to rely\non techniques such as DLL search order hijacking\nor modifying Windows registry keys to achieve\npersistence.\n\n–– The group used the Adore-NG rootkit on older Linux\n\noperating systems to hide their Linux backdoor\nADORE.XSEC. Note that the Adore-ng rootkit is\nno longer in development and would likely not run\nsuccessfully on modern Linux systems, but APT41\ndeployed this on a legacy game server.\n\nAPT41 is well-known for leveraging compromised digital\ncertificates from video game studios to sign malware. The\ngroup has abused at least 19 different certificates in this\nway. Additional details on code-signing certificates are\nprovided in the section \"Use of Code Signing Certificates.\"\n\n- In 2012, APT41 used a code-signing certificate from\n\nMgame, a South Korean game publisher, against other\ngaming industry entities. The serial number for this\ncertificate was:\n```\n     01:00:00:00:00:01:30:73:85:f7:02\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n- A different Mgame digital certificate has been used\n\nby several other Chinese operators, including APT17,\nAPT20, and APT31. It is unclear if this certificate\nwas compromised at the same time as the one used\nby APT41 (or if it was stolen by APT41 and shared\nwith these other groups). The serial number for this\ncertificate was:\n```\n 4e:eb:08:05:55:f1:ab:f7:09:bb:a9:ca:e3:2f:13:cd\n\n```\nAPT41 has blatantly engaged in financially motivated\nactivity targeting the video game industry, including\nmanipulating virtual currencies. These activities\ndemonstrate established connections to underground\nmarketplaces and familiarity with monetization and\nlaundering techniques.\n\n- Using its access to a game production environment, in\n\nless than three hours the group generated tens of millions\nof dollars of a popular game's virtual currency. The\nmoney was credited to more than 1,000 accounts and\nmost likely sold and laundered in underground markets.\n\n- APT41 has targeted payment services specializing in\n\nhandling in-game transactions and real money transfer\n(RMT) purchases.\n\n- In a highly unusual case, APT41 attempted to extort\n\na game company by deploying the Encryptor RaaS\n\n\nransomware. We suggest that APT41 sought to target\nin-game currency but found they could not monetize\nthe specific targeted game, so the group resorted to\nransomware to attempt to salvage their efforts and\nprofit from the compromise.\n\n–– This ransomware was sold via a Ransomware-as\na-Service (RaaS) operation that was available via a\nTor (.onion) website. Users of the ransomware were\ncharged a 20 percent fee for any collected ransom.\n\n–– Since this was not the group's typical method\n\nof choice for collecting money from a victim\nenvironment, it is possible that APT41 turned to a payfor-service ransomware to avoid having to develop\nsuch a tool or set up the associated payment and\ninfrastructure associated with collecting the ransom.\n\n–– APT41 attempted to deploy the ransomware through\n\na group policy (GPO) scheduled task. However, the\nmalware was unsuccessfully deployed because of a\nsimple typo.\n\n–– Figure 7 shows the ransom note associated with\n\nEncryptor RaaS, which contains default messages in\nboth English and German (the instruction links have\nbeen redacted). Given that this is the default message,\nthe languages in the note should not be considered\nwhen determining actor origin or location.\n\n\n**Figure 7:**\nScreenshot of\nransomware note.\n\n```\nATTENTION!\n\n```\nThe files on your computer have been securely encrypted.\nTo get access to your files again, follow the instructions at:\n```\nACHTUNG!\n\n```\nDie Dateien auf Ihrem Computer wurden ischer verschluesselt.\nUm den Zugriff auf Ihre Dateien wiederzuerlangen, folgen Sie der Anleitung auf:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Third-Party Access\n\nIn multiple instances, APT41 targeted third parties and leveraged this access to\ntarget additional victims. APT41's exploitation of third parties varied. In some\ninstances, APT41 moved laterally from one victim environment to another in\norder to initiate compromise. APT41 has also used credentials compromised in\nprevious operations.\n\n- In 2014, APT41 compromised an online billing/payment service using VPN\n\naccess between a third-party service provider and the targeted payment\nservice. The payment service was likely targeted because it provided access\nto multiple gaming companies.\n\n\nindicate that these may have been the HIGHNOON backdoor.\n\n[According to statements by a TeamViewer's spokesperson, the company](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/85733/hacking/teamviewer-2016-hack.html)\n\nwas targeted in fall 2016. The company stated that they conducted a\ncomprehensive security audit of its IT architecture and added additional\nsecurity measures to help strengthen its security posture.\n\n\n-----\n\n## History of Supply Chain\n Compromises\n\n\nSupply chain compromises are most likely an extension\nof APT41's tactics used in gaining access to gaming\ndevelopment environments and to other gaming\norganizations via third-party service providers. Public\nreports of supply chain compromises linked to APT41 date\nback to at least 2014, and technical evidence associated\nwith these incidents was used to determine a relationship,\nif any, with APT41. Our assessment in each of these cases\nis noted in Table 1.\n\n- As demonstrated in operations targeting the video\n\ngame industry, APT41 leverages a variety of TTPs to\naccess production environments where they can inject\nmalicious code into legitimate files. The files are signed\nwith valid code-signing certificates and distributed\nwidely to end users.\n\n- Supply chain targeting requires more effort than\n\ntypically observed mass targeting methods, such as\nestablishing a strategic web compromise (SWC) or\nconducting large spear-phishing campaigns.\n\n\nAlthough APT41 supply chain compromises affect very\nlarge numbers of victims, the group limits follow-on\nactivity to select victims most likely to reduce detection\nand ensure any additional malware is delivered only\nto intended victims. Counterintuitively, supply chain\noperations add an additional layer of obscurity to the\ngroup's operations because it is difficult to pinpoint the\ndesired target set.\n\n- In a June 2018 supply chain compromise, APT41\n\nleveraged MAC addresses and C:\\ drive volume serial\nnumbers to identify specifically targeted victims for\nfollow-on activity. This significantly obfuscates the\ntargeted sector or victim set; in a typical spear-phishing\ncampaign, for example, desired targeting can be\ndiscerned based on recipients' email addresses.\n\n\n**Table 1. Supply chain compromises.**\n\n\n**Date** **Compromised Entities** **FireEye Attribution Assessment**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### December 2014\n\nIn December 2014, installers for three online games\npublished by a Southeast Asian video game distributor\nwere injected with the SOGU backdoor. The installer for\nthese popular games was replaced by a malicious file\nthat dropped the SOGU backdoor along with the normal\ngame installer.\n\n- The video game distributor operates servers in East\n\nand Southeast Asia for some of the most popular\nonline games, including the three games that were\ncompromised: Path of Exile, League of Legends, and\nFIFA Online 3 (Table 2).\n\nWe have observed many similarities between TTPs\ninvolved in this compromise and APT41, including:\n\n- Targeting the same victim organization 31 days apart\n\n- Use of code-signing certificates from the same video\n\ngame-related issuer organizations\n\n\n\n- Use of the same malware families (HIGHNOON.BIN,\n\nHIGHNOON.LITE, EASYNIGHT, FRONTWHEEL)\n\n- Use of HIGHNOON.BIN samples with the same\n\ncompile times\n\n- Overlap in domain resolution to the same IP netblock\n\n(61.38.186.0/24) during the same time frame in 2012\n\n- Video game-related supply chain targeting\n\nDespite these compelling overlaps, the actors responsible\nfor this compromise leverage additional unique tools not\nobserved with APT41 or any other Chinese espionage\ngroup, suggesting that they are either part of APT41 and\nmaintain their own toolset, or a close affiliate of APT41 that\nshares both tools and taskings.\n\n\n**Table 2. 2014 compromised games.**\n\n\n**Game** **File MD5** **Malware** **C&C**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### March 2017\n\nIn March 2017, suspected Chinese espionage operators\ntargeted CCleaner, a utility that assists in the removal of\n[unwanted files from a computer. According to the parent](https://blog.avast.com/update-ccleaner-attackers-entered-via-teamviewer)\ncompany, Avast, the infected CCleaner was downloaded\nby 2.27 million customers. While we have identified some\noverlaps between the CCleaner activity and APT41, we do\nnot have enough information to attribute the CCleaner\ncompromise to APT41 at this time.\n\n- Both APT41 and the actors in the CCleaner incident\n\nused TeamViewer during initial compromise. According\nto Avast, the actors used TeamViewer to compromise a\ndeveloper workstation and used VBScript (x64.vbs) to\ndrop a malicious payload.\n\n- The compromised CCleaner update (which we call\n\nDIRTCLEANER) is believed to download a second-stage\nloader (MD5: 748aa5fcfa2af451c76039faf6a8684d) that\ncontains a 32-bit and 64-bit COLDJAVA DLL payload.\nThe COLDJAVA payload contains shellcode that loads a\nvariant of BLACKCOFFEE (Figure 8).\n\n– While COLDJAVA has been used by APT41, –\n\nBLACKCOFFEE has been used by other Chinese\n[cyber espionage groups, including APT17 and APT40.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/05/hiding_in_plain_sigh.html)\nIt is possible that COLDJAVA may also be shared\nbetween distinct cyber espionage operators.\n\n- Malware samples identified in the CCleaner incident\n\nincluded notable shared design decisions observed in\nAPT41 malware, including the use of domain generation\n\n**Figure 8: Malware**\ndownloaded by\nDIRTCLEANER.\n\nDIRTCLEANER COLDJAVA BLACKCOFFEE\n\n\nalgorithms (DGA) for C&C, use of dead drop resolvers\n[(DDR), and use of shellcode as primary payloads.](https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/fireye/images/APT17_Report.pdf)\nHowever, FireEye malware analysis of the compromised\nCCleaner samples and associated COLDJAVA samples\ndid not reveal shared code with the POISONPLUG and\nPOISONPLUG.SHADOW malware samples used in\nsimilar supply chain incidents by APT41.\n\n–– DIRTCLEANER uses DGA to generate new C&C\n\ndomains each month. This is similar to first-stage\nmalware used in the Netsarang compromise described\nbelow.\n\n–– The BLACKCOFFEE sample reaches out to actor\ncontrolled profiles hosted on legitimate websites to\nretrieve encoded commands for C&C, a technique\nknown as DDR. The malware parses the content of\nthe websites (listed in Table 3), looking for 12 bytes\ncontained between the tags: \"BSM1cr0S0ft\" and\n\"SBM1cr0Soft.\" APT41 POISONPLUG samples have\nalso used DDR for C&C.\n\n–– The POISONPLUG and POISONPLUG.SHADOW\n\nsamples in similar supply chain incidents use a\nshellcode format that resembles PE files, while the\nBLACKCOFFEE backdoor that was delivered in the\nCCleaner compromise uses a traditional PIC blob.\nAdditionally, there is apparent code reuse between\nobserved POISONPLUG and POISONPLUG samples\nnot observed in the CCleaner samples.\n\n\n**Table 3. BLACKCOFFEE DDR websites.**\n\n\n**File MD5** **Legitimate DDR Websites Used for C&C**\n\n```\n3ca2a13f646690481\ndc15d78bac6d829\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n#### July 2017\n\nIn July 2017, APT41 injected malicious code into a software\nupdate package maintained by Netsarang and signed it\nwith a legitimate Netsarang certificate in an operation\n[referred to as \"ShadowPad\" by Kaspersky. The software](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/)\npackage is reportedly used by hundreds of companies\nworldwide.\n\n- We observed numerous opportunistic infections\n\nassociated with POISONPLUG.SHADOW spanning 13\ncountries and a variety of industries, demonstrating the\nbroad impact of this operation. However, we have not\nobserved the associated second-stage at any victim\norganizations. Open-source reporting indicated one\nvictim was identified in Hong Kong.\n\n- Signing the malicious update with a legitimate\n\nNetSarang certificate is consistent with APT41's pattern\nof using legitimate certificates. In this case, all updates\nwere required to be signed by Netsarang, which means\nAPT41 had to use the code-signing certificate to subvert\nthe update mechanism.\n\n\n–– Alternatively, it is also possible that APT41 injected\n\nmalicious code into the package prior to compilation,\ncircumventing the need to steal the code-signing\ncertificate and compile it on their own.\n\n- The first stage of the malware uses DGA, which changes\n\nits C&C servers monthly. The use of shifting network\ninfrastructure is most likely intended to add operational\nrobustness and to reduce detection.\n\n- The second-stage shellcode is initialized only after it\n\nis activated using a decryption key retrieved from the\nfirst-stage DNS communications. This likely allows\nAPT41 to selectively activate the payload on specific\nvictim systems. The second-stage payload contains the\ndefault C&C server, notped.com, which overlaps with\nother APT41 C&C infrastructure. Other reported APT41\ndomains that may also be related to the second-stage\npayload can be found in Table 4.\n\n\n**Table 4. Reported APT41 domains associated with POISONPLUG.SHADOW.**\n\n\n**Domain** **Associated Malware Family**\n\n\n-----\n\n### June 2018\n\nIn June 2018, a utility used to update ASUS\ncomputers was compromised in an operation dubbed\n**[\"ShadowHammer\" by Kaspersky. Open-source](https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer-a-high-profile-supply-chain-attack/90380/)**\nreporting **[indicated that more than 50,000 systems](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/shadow-hammer-teaser/26149/)**\ninstalled the malicious update, yet the malware was\nonly designed to execute and retrieve second-stage\nmalware on a designated list of approximately 600\nsystems, demonstrating this was a targeted campaign.\n**[Public reporting on the incident noted that many of the](https://www.zdnet.com/article/researchers-publish-list-of-mac-addresses-targeted-in-asus-hack/)**\ntargeted MAC addresses were associated with wireless\nadapters from various vendors, partially indicating the\noperation's targeting strategy.\n\n- Although we have limited visibility into the intended\n\ntargets of this operation, we observed one of the\nwhitelisted MAC addresses on a system at a telecom\ncompany.\n\n- Kaspersky's analysis of the infected machines revealed\n\nthat a POISONPLUG backdoor was installed as a result\nof the malicious update. While we have been unable to\nattribute the DAYJOB malware used in the incident to\nAPT41 due to an inability to independently confirm this\n\n\nsequence of events, we confirm the reported stagetwo POISONPLUG backdoor is attributed to APT41,\ncontained several gaming references, and was likely\nused to target the gaming industry.\n\n- The POISONPLUG sample (MD5:\n\n37e100dd8b2ad8b301b130c2bca3f1ea) attempts to\nconnect to a Google document that was created under\nthe same name and email address (Tom Giardino and\n\n) that was used to target the\ncryptocurrency organization. It also attempts to connect\nto a Steam community page (Table 5).\n\n- The POISONPLUG payload uses DDR and parses the\n\nGoogle document for a C&C command. The Steam\ncommunity page is likely used as a fallback mechanism.\n\n- FireEye malware analysis of the POISONPLUG sample\n\nindicates the malware is likely designed to run only\none system with a C: drive volume serial number of\n0xc25cff4c.\n\n- Additional POISONPLUG samples located in Table 6 also\n\nleverage Google Document and Steam Community Pages\nfor C&C.\n\n\n**Table 5. \"ShadowHammer\" stage-two POISONPLUG sample.**\n\n\n**File MD5** **C&C Domain**\n\n```\n37e100dd8b2ad8b301b130c2bca3f1ea\n\n```\n\n**Table 6.

Ironically,\nXigncode is a service intended to prevent hacking and\ncheating in online games.\n\n- We attribute these compromises (also reported by both\n\n**[ESET and Kaspersky) to APT41 based on the unique](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/03/11/gaming-industry-scope-attackers-asia/)**\nuse of the CRACKSHOT backdoor and tactics consistent\nwith APT41 operations.

These connections, illustrated in\nFigure 10, led us to identify the malware used in the\nNetsarang incident as a variant of POISONPLUG\n(therefore: POISONPLUG.SHADOW).\n\n– The POISONPLUG and POISONPLUG.SHADOW –\n\nvariants share the observed commonalities:\n\n§ The entrypoint functions for both loaders use the\n\nsame instructions, constants, and structures to pass\ncontrol to loading routines.\n\n§ The layout of functions and data within the\n\nloaders are the same; for example, following the\nentrypoint, both loaders contain an unusual region\nof structured data 0x60 bytes long.\n\n\n§ Both loaders use the same API hashing algorithm\n\nto resolve routines from system libraries (Figure\n11 and Figure 12). The routine uses byte-wise\noperations to compute a hash, including byte-wise\nrotate-right by eight bytes, byte-wise binary, OR\nwith 0x2, and byte-wise XOR using the four-byte\nkey 0x7C35D9A3. Using this routine, the hash for\nkernel32.dll, a common DLL provided by Microsoft\nWindows, is 0xFD5B1261.\n\n- FireEye analysis of a separate POISONPLUG payload\n\n(MD5: c8403fabda4d036a55d0353520e765c9)\ncompiled in July 2017 and the POISONPLUG.\nSHADOW stage-two shellcode loader (MD5:\n72584d6b7dd10c82d9118567b548b2b1) identified\nmultiple additional plug-in similarities.\n\n–– Core plug-in IDs between the samples are the same,\n\nincluding 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, and 201.\n\n–– Core plug-in names are the same including Plugins,\n\nOnline, Config, Install, and HTTP.\n\n–– C&C plug-in IDs and names between both samples\n\nare the same, including 200/TCP, 201/HTTP, 202/UDP,\n203/DNS, 204/HTTPS, and 205/SSL.\n\n–– Both samples parse the C&C response by searching\n\nfor \"$\" characters and decoding the result.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attribution\n\nWe assess with high confidence that APT41 is attributable\nto Chinese individuals who are working on behalf of the\nChinese state in conducting cyber espionage operations,\nand that these actors are also running financially\nmotivated campaigns for personal gain.\n\nTwo identified personas using the monikers \"Zhang\nXuguang\" and \"Wolfzhi\" linked to APT41's operations\nhave also been identified in Chinese-language forums.\nAttribution to these individuals is backed by identified\npersona information, the previous work of these\nindividuals, their apparent expertise in programming skills,\nand their targeting of Chinese market-specific games.\nIt is uncertain how many other individuals may also be\nassociated with APT41.\n\n- Multiple domains leveraged by early APT41 activity\n\nwere registered by emails and names associated with\nboth Zhang Xuguang and Wolfzhi (or their alternative\nmonikers). Registrant information also included\nreferences to Beijing and Chinese phone numbers (+86\ncountry code).\n\nZhang Xuguang (张旭光) registered more than a dozen\ndomains masquerading as video games or companies\nwith trusted relationships with video game developers/\ndistributors.

See the\nsection \"Links to Other Known Chinese Operators\" for\nmore details.\n\n- An APT41 HIGHNOON sample (MD5:\n\n36711896cfeb67f599305b590f195aec) from 2012\ncontained a process debugging path (.pdb) with the\nChinese-language directory \"D:\\桌面\\木马,\" which\ntranslates to \"D:\\Desktop\\trojan.\"\n\n\n\n- Compiled HTML (.chm) files used in targeting contained\n\na language code set to \"Chinese (Simplified)\" despite\nthe lure content being in the target region's language\n(English or otherwise).\n\n- Compile and operational times of APT41 activity\n\nsuggest the bulk of the group's work hours, 10:00\nand 23:00 (UTC +8), are consistent with the Chinese\nworkday, especially for tech sector employees on a \"996\nschedule.\"\n\n–– Figure 4 shows a breakdown of all of the operational\n\nactivity within victim environments, separated\nbetween gaming and espionage (non-gaming)\nactivity. Analysis of the times where APT41 modified\nor accessed a file within a victim environment, shows\na concentration between 10:00 and 18:00 (UTC+8).\n\n- Targeting of healthcare, semiconductors, and telecoms\n\nis consistent with Chinese state interests and parallels\nactivity from other Chinese espionage groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Status as Potential Contractors\n\n\nWe assess with moderate confidence that APT41 is\nconstituted of contractors tasked by the Chinese state\nto conduct espionage operations. Individuals attributed\nto the group have previously indicated that they\ncould be hired and advertised their skills and services.\nAPT41's use of the same malware in both financial- and\nespionage-related operations could support their status\nas contractors; state employees are less likely to use such\ntools for personal financial gain over multiple years given\nthe potential for greater scrutiny or punishment.\n\n- APT41 cyber crime activity includes the use of\n\nespionage-only malware, indicating two possible\nconclusions: either APT41 is operating outside of\nstate control but still working with other Chinese APT\nmalware actors, tools, and infrastructure on a parttime or contractual basis, or APT41 is a full-time, statesponsored APT actor but is also working outside of\nstate control or direction for supplemental income.\n\n– Tools used by APT41 in financially motivated –\n\noperations include the use of HOMEUNIX and PHOTO,\nwhich are non-public malware used only by other\nChinese espionage actors.\n\n– A loose time separation between espionage and –\n\ncyber crime activities provides some indication that\nthe group divides its work hours between both types\nof operations. For additional details, see Figure 4 and\nthe previous section \"Financially Motivated Activity.\"\n\n**Figure 16:**\n\nOcean injection\ntool posted by\nZhang.\n\n\n\n- **[Public reports on Chinese hackers highlight that skilled](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/world/asia/in-china-hacking-has-widespread-acceptance.html)**\n\nactors opt to work for private sector entities that have\ngovernment contracts because of better pay.\n\n- Underground activity dating back to 2009 indicated\n\nthat Zhang Xuguang is a hacker for hire.

Initial reports about\nHIGHNOON and its variants (reported publicly as\n\"Winnti\") dating back to at least 2013 indicated the\ntool was exclusive to a single group, contributing to\nsignificant conflation across multiple distinct espionage\noperations.\n\n\n\n- APT41 overlaps at least partially with public reporting\n\n[on groups including BARIUM (Microsoft) and Winnti](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/01/25/detecting-threat-actors-in-recent-german-industrial-attacks-with-windows-defender-atp/)\n[(Kaspersky, ESET, Clearsky). In some cases, the](https://securelist.com/winnti-more-than-just-a-game/37029/)\nprimary observed similarity in the publicly reported\nWinnti activity was the use of the same malware—\nincluding HIGHNOON—across otherwise separate\nclusters of activity.\n\n- Previous FireEye Threat Intelligence reporting on the\n\nuse of HIGHNOON and related activity was grouped\ntogether under both GREF and Mana, although we\nnow understand this to be the work of several Chinese\ncyber espionage groups that share tools and digital\ncertificates.\n\n- APT41 reflects our current understanding of what was\n\npreviously reported as GREF, as well as additional\nindicators and activity gathered during our extensive\nreview of our intelligence holdings.\n\n\nreview of our intelligence holdings.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Certificate Overlap**\n\nA digital certificate issued by YNK\nJapan that was publicly reported\nas being used by Winnti has been\nused by multiple Chinese espionage\noperators, including APT17, and\nAPT20, and APT41.\n\nA self-signed digital certificate\npurporting to be from the Microsoft\nCertificate Authority has been used\nby both APT41 and APT40 to sign\nsamples of the PHOTO backdoor.\n\nThe overlaps in groups observed using\nthese certificates is illustrated in\nTable 8.\n\n\nIssuer: CN=VeriSign Class 3 Code Signing 2009-2 CA\nSubject: CN=YNK JAPAN Inc\nSerial Number: 67:24:34:0d:db:c7:25:2f:7f:b7:14:b8:12:a5:c0:4d\nIssue-Date: 11/27/09, Expiration-Date: 11/27/11\n\nIssuer: CN=Microsoft Certificate Authority\nSubject: CN=Microsoft Certificate Authority\nSerial Number: (Negative)77:62:e5:c6:c9:c2:75:59:b0:b8:f5:56:60:61:d8:78\nIssue-Date: 12/31/2009, Expiration-Date: 12/30/2035\n\n\n**Table 8.

This technique uses a legitimate and often](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-dll-sideloading.pdf)\ndigitally signed executable to essentially trick a system\ninto launching a malicious DLL because it has been given\nthe same name as a legitimate DLL normally loaded by\nthe executable. The use of a valid and digitally signed\n\n\nexecutable allows actors to bypass host-based security\nmeasures. For this reason, it continues to be popular\nmechanism used by multiple groups. This also explains\nwhy the use of these DLL filenames is not a unique\nindicator for distinct APT operators. Table 9 contains\nlegitimate executables used by APT41 and selected other\nChinese cyber espionage groups for DLL side-loading:\n\n\n**Table 9.

Source code overlaps between observed\ncode families indicate potential access to shared code\nrepositories or common developers between groups.\n\n- APT41 has used several malware families that have\n\nalso been used by other Chinese espionage operators,\nincluding variants of HIGHNOON, HOMEUNIX, PHOTO,\nSOGU, and ZXSHELL, among others. Table 10 illustrates\nsome of overlap between malware families used by\nAPT41 and other APT groups. Note that this is only for\nillustration purposes and is not indicative of all observed\nmalware families used by these APT groups or all groups\nthat have used those families.\n\n\n–– HIGHNOON, one of the main code families observed\n\nbeing used by APT41, was also used by APT17 in 2015\nto target semiconductor and chemical manufacturers.\n\n–– HOMEUNIX, another popular backdoor used by\n\nAPT41, has been used by at least 14 separate Chinese\nespionage groups, including APT1, APT10, APT17,\nAPT18, and APT20.\n\n–– JUMPALL is a dropper that has been observed\n\ndropping variants of the HIGHNOON, ZXSHELL, and\nSOGU code families attributed to APT17 and APT41.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 10.

APT41 files containing PDB paths\nreferencing \"RBDoor\" are listed in Table 13. At least\ntwo of these malware families, HIGHNOON.CLI and\nGEARSHIFT, have been used by APT17 and another\nsuspected Chinese espionage group.\n\n- Further information regarding code family overlaps\n\nbetween variants can be found in \"Technical Annex:\nAdditional Malware Overlaps.\"\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 17:**\n\nPDB paths\ncontaining\n\"RBDoor\".\n\n\n###### H:\\Double-V1\\stone_srv\\Bin\\RbDoor64.pdb H:\\Double\\Door_wh\\AppInit\\x64\\Release\\AppInit.pdb H:\\Double\\Door_wh\\RbDoorX64\\x64\\Release\\RbDoorX64.pdb H:\\Double\\door_wh_kav\\Bin\\RbDoor64.pdb H:\\RBDoor\\Anti_winmm\\AppInit\\AppInit\\Release\\AppInit.pdb H:\\RBDoor\\Anti_winmm\\AppInit\\AppInit\\x64\\Release\\AppInit.pdb H:\\RBDoor\\Anti_winmm\\AppInit\\ShutDownEvent\\x64\\Release\\ShutDownEvent.pdb H:\\RbDoor\\Anti_winmm\\AppInit\\AppInit\\Release\\AppInit.pdb H:\\RbDoor\\Anti_winmm\\AppInit\\RbDoorX64\\Release\\RbDoor.pdb H:\\RbDoor\\Anti_winmm\\AppInit\\ShutDownEvent\\Release\\ShutDownEvent.pdb H:\\RbDoor\\Lib\\WMI_SSL\\RemoteLib\\bin\\TestRjLib.pdb H:\\Svn\\Double-V1\\stone_srv\\Bin\\RbDoor64.pdb\n\n\n**Table 13.

Notably, most of the digital\ncertificates being used in this manner are valid unrevoked\ndigital certificates stolen from East Asia-based game\ndevelopment studios. APT41 likely signs their malware\nto ensure compatibility with the targeted systems and to\npotentially avoid detection.\n\n- [Microsoft requires all kernel-mode drivers to be signed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-signing)\n\nin order to run on operating systems running Windows\nVista or later.\n\n- The use of code-signing certificates can also\n\nsignificantly decrease the likelihood that a malicious\npayload is detected.\n\nAlthough we do not have direct evidence of APT41\nspecifically targeting and stealing code-signing certificates,\nwe have some indication from targeting of affected\norganizations within the same time frame that digital\ncertificates are first compromised and used to sign malware.\n\n- Stealing private keys or compromising an organization's\n\ninfrastructure to access and steal digital certificates\nabuses trust relationships between firms and certificate\nauthorities. Malicious files signed with valid digital\ncertificates can circumvent automated scanning/\nblocking solutions and bypass Windows group policies\nwhich restrict unsigned code from running.\n\n– Even when detected, malicious files signed by –\n\na digital certificate from a trusted partner or\nassociated business are less likely to draw suspicion.\nAccording to an advertisement in an underground\nmarketplace, the success rate of installing a payload\nincreases by as much as 50 percent when signing\nfiles with valid digital certificates.\n\n\n–– In most cases, multiple digital certificates are issued to\n\nan organization using the same public name, making\nit more difficult to identify a compromised certificate\namong others with identical names.\n\n–– Certificate authorities are responsible for revoking\n\ncompromised digital certificates, although response\ntimes can vary greatly, and digital certificates can\ncontinue to be abused even long after they are first\nidentified being misused.\n\n- Several malware samples were signed very close to the\n\ncertificate issue date, suggesting that APT41 or a related\nactor had access to the private key or build environment\nat that time. It is also possible the group acquired the\nprivate keys soon after they were issued.\n\n- In some cases, digital certificates were used to sign\n\nmalware samples just before they expired, most likely\nindicating the actors were actively managing a library of\ndigital certificates for this purpose.\n\n- Figure 18 depicts compile times of malware signed with\n\ncompromised digital certificates within the time frame\nthat the certificates were valid. All of the certificates\nlisted in the graphic have either been revoked or are\ncurrently expired. Indicators associated with these\ncertificates are listed in \"Technical Annex: Code Signing\nCertificates Used by APT41.\"\n\n- Alternatively, it is possible APT41 may have purchased\n\nthe digital certificates used for signing malware within\nan underground market. FireEye researchers found that\ncode signing certificates are currently available for sale\nin underground marketplaces for as little as $399 USD,\nalthough ones that go through rigorous vetting can be\nsold for $1,699 USD.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 18:** First observed malware\nsamples signed with digital certificates\n(white) in relation to valid certificate\ndates (blue).\n\n###### Observed Use Of Code Signing Certificates\n\nElectronics Extreme Limited\n\nZepetto Co.\n\nEn Masse Entertainment\n\nGameUS Inc.\n\nShanda Games\n\nNetSarang Computer\n\nWemade Entertainment Co.\n\nXL Games Co.\n\nNanjing Ranyi Technology Co.\n\nGuangzhou YuanLuo Technology Co.\n\nFuqing Dawu Technolofy Co.\n\nMgame Corp\n\nxlgames\n\nNeowix Corporation\n\nWebzen Inc.\n\nGuangzhou YuanLuo Technology Co.\n\nYNK JAPAN Inc.\n\n**11/27/09** **4/11/11** **8/23/12** **1/5/14** **5/20/15** **10/1/16** **2/13/18** **6/28/19**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Outlook and Implications\n\nAPT41 is a dual threat demonstrating creativity\nand aggressiveness in carrying out both espionage\ncampaigns and financially motivated operations.

In these instances, APT41 leveraged TeamViewer to transfer malware\ninto the compromised environment, although we do not have direct evidence of APT41\ncompromising TeamViewer.\n\n–– In July 2017, APT41 initiated a TeamViewer session and transferred files that were\n\nlater deleted. Filenames and creation times indicate that these may have been the\nHIGHNOON backdoor.\n\n–– In May 2018, APT41 used TeamViewer for initial entry in the compromise of a healthcare\n\ncompany. During this intrusion, APT41 started a TeamViewer session and shortly\nafter transferred DLL files associated with the CROSSWALK backdoor to the victim\nenvironment before deploying CROSSWALK.\n\nThe group has leveraged several exploits in their operations. Notably, APT41 was observed\nusing proof-of-concept exploit code for CVE-2019-3396 within 23 days after the\nConfluence vulnerability was announced.\n\n**Observed Vulnerabilities**\n\n- CVE-2012-0158\n\n- CVE-2015-1641\n\n- CVE-2017-0199\n\n- CVE-2017-11882\n\n- CVE-2019-3396\n\nAPT41 compromised one organization and moved to a client environment.\n\n\n-----\n\n- ASPXSpy\n\n- ACEHASH\n\n- Beacon\n\n- CHINACHOP\n\n- COLDJAVA\n\n- CRACKSHOT\n\n- CROSSWALK\n\n- DEADEYE\n\n- DOWNTIME\n\n- EASYNIGHT\n\n- Gh0st\n\n\n\n- HIGHNOON.LITE\n\n- HIGHNOON.PASTEBOY\n\n- HOTCHAI\n\n- HKDOOR\n\n- JUMPALL\n\n- LATELUNCH\n\n- LIFEBOAT\n\n- LOWKEY\n\n- njRAT\n\n- POISONPLUG\n\n\n\n- POISONPLUG.SHADOW\n\n- POTROAST\n\n- SAGEHIRE\n\n- SOGU\n\n- SWEETCANDLE\n\n- TERA\n\n- TIDYELF\n\n- XDOOR\n\n- WINTERLOVE\n\n- ZXSHELL\n\n\nAPT41 has been observed using Linux and Windows variants of the same malware families,\nsuch as PHOTO and HIGHNOON. The group often initially installs its backdoors to c:\\\nwindows\\temp.\n\nWe have observed APT41 attempting to masquerade their files and domains as popular\nanti-virus software:\n\n\n\n\nAPT41 appears to use the commercially available Beacon backdoor that is part of the\nCobalt Strike pen-testing software platform. In at least one instance, a server used for\nBeacon C&C was also leveraged for CROSSWALK C&C.\n\nOn multiple occasions, APT41 leveraged the Sticky Keys vulnerability and PowerShell to\ndeploy malware families in victims' environments.\n\n\n-----\n\n- ACEHASH\n\n- GEARSHIFT\n\n- GOODLUCK\n\n- Mimikatz\n\n\n\n- NTDSDump\n\n- PHOTO\n\n- PwDump\n\n- WINTERLOVE\n\n\n**Windows Credential Editor (WCE)**\nAPT41 frequently uses the Windows Credential Editor to dump password hashes from\nmemory and authenticate other user accounts.\n\nAPT41 conducts network reconnaissance after using compromised credentials to log on\nto other systems. The group leverages built-in Windows commands, such as \"netstat\"\nand \"net share,\" in addition to the custom and non-public malware families SOGU,\nHIGHNOON, and WIDETONE.\n\n- HIGHNOON includes the ability to collect host information by enumerating active\n\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions.\n\n- SOGU is capable of listing TCP and UDP network connections, respectively.\n\n- WIDETONE is capable of conducting port scans and password brute-force attacks and\n\ncollecting network information. It contains an embedded variant of a publicly available\nenumeration tool and can be run with the following options:\n\n–– \"-hbs\" option runs a port scan on the specified subnet.\n\n–– \"-hscan\" scans the specified IP range for IPC and SQL services.\n\n–– \"-enum\" queries a Windows host for requested information, such as users, groups/\n\nmembers, policies, and more.\n\n\n-----\n\ncmd.exe /c whoami > C:\\wmi.dll 2>&1\ncmd.exe /c del C:\\wmi.dll /F > nul 2>&1\n\ncmd.exe /c a.bat > C:\\wmi.dll 2>&1\n\n\n-----\n\n- APT41 leveraged ROCKBOOT as a persistence mechanism for PHOTO and TERA\n\nbackdoors. The bootkit performs raw disk operations to bypass the typical MBR boot\nsequence and execute the backdoors prior to the host operating system. This technique\nwas implemented to ensure the malware would execute at system runtime and was\ndesigned to be difficult to detect and prevent. APT41 ROCKBOOT samples have been\nsigned with legitimate code-signing certificates from MGame and Neowiz, two South\nKorean video game companies.\n\n- APT41 leveraged ADORE.XSEC, a Linux backdoor launched by the Adore-NG rootkit,\n\nthroughout an organization's Linux environment. The group installed the backdoor and\nthe Adore-NG rootkit persistently by creating a hidden shell script in \"/etc/rc.d/init.d,\"\na directory that contains the startup scripts for many system services. The Adore-NG\nrootkit is used to hide the backdoor and authenticate any incoming connections using a\nprovided password.\n\n- The group also uses CROSSWALK.BIN, FRONTWHEEL, HIGHNOON.BIN, HIGHNOON.\n\nLINUX, HOMEUNIX, and PACMAN to maintain presence.\n\nIn some instances, APT41 leveraged POISONPLUG as a first-stage backdoor to deploy the\nHIGHNOON backdoor in the targeted environment. We observed APT41 use PowerSploit\nwith the capability to use WMI as a persistence mechanism. The group also deploys the\nSOGU and CROSSWALK malware families as means to maintain presence.\n\nAPT41 has demonstrated it is highly agile, responding quickly to changes in victim\nenvironments and incident responder activity.\n\n- Hours after a victimized organization made changes to thwart APT41, the group\n\nregistered a new C&C domain, compiled a new SOGU backdoor variant, and deployed\nthe new backdoor to several systems across multiple geographic regions.\n\n- APT41 sent spear-phishing emails to multiple HR employees three days after the\n\ncompromise had been remediated and systems were brought back online. Within hours\nof a user opening the malicious attachment dropping a HOMEUNIX backdoor, APT41\nregained a foothold within the environment by installing PHOTO on the organization's\nservers across multiple geographic regions.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Avoiding C&C Detection**\nAt times APT41 uses legitimate websites, such as GitHub,\nPastebin, and Microsoft TechNet, to avoid detection.\nInterestingly, some of the group's POISONPLUG malware\nsamples leverage the Steam Community website\nassociated with Valve, a video game developer and\npublisher. This technique of storing encoded or encrypted\nstrings, known as dead drop resolvers (DDR), on legitimate\nwebsites that can subvert network defenders as traffic to\nand from the sites is typically benign.\n\nThe group has also configured Linux backdoors to run\non ports used by legitimate applications within victim\nenvironments, enabling malicious traffic to bypass network\nsecurity measures and hide malicious activity within the\norganization's regular application traffic.\n\n\n**Preventing Anti-Virus Updates**\nBefore attempting to deploy the publicly available\nRansomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) Encryptor RaaS\nthrough group policy, APT41 blocked victim systems\nfrom retrieving anti-virus updates by accessing the DNS\nmanagement console and implementing a forward lookup\non the domain used for anti-virus updates to the park IP\naddress \"1.1.1.1.\"\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TECHNICAL ANNEX\n## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping\n\n\n**Initial Access**\n\n\n**Persistence**\n\n\nt1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application\n\n\nt1015 Accessibility Features\n\n\nt1133 External Remote Services\n\nt1193 Spear-phishing Attachment\n\nt1195 Supply Chain Compromise\n\nt1199 Trusted Relationship\n\nt1078 Valid Accounts\n\n\n**Execution**\n\n\nt1059 Command-Line Interface\n\n\nt1223 Compiled HTML File\n\nt1106 Execution through API\n\nt1129 Execution through Module Load\n\nt1203 Exploitation for Client Execution\n\nt1061 Graphical User Interface\n\nt1170 Mshta\n\nt1086 PowerShell\n\nt1053 Scheduled Task\n\nt1085 Rundll32\n\nt1064 Scripting\n\nt1035 Service Execution\n\nt1204 User Execution\n\nt1047 Windows Management Instrumentation\n\n\nt1098 Account Manipulation\n\nt1067 Bootkit\n\nt1136 Create Account\n\nt1038 DLL Search Order Hijacking\n\nt1133 External Remote Services\n\nt1179 Hooking\n\nt1031 Modify Existing Service\n\nt1050 New Service\n\nt1034 Path Interception\n\nt1108 Redundant Access\n\nt1060 Registry Run Keys / Start Folder\n\nt1165 Startup Items\n\nt1078 Valid Accounts\n\n\nt1015 Accessibility Features\n\nt1038 DLL Search Order Hijacking\n\nt1034 Path Interception\n\nt1055 Process Injection\n\nt1078 Valid Accounts\n\n\nt1100 Web Shell\n\n\n**Privilege Escalation**\n\n\nt1134 Access Token Manipulation\n\n\nt1100 Web Shell\n\n\n-----\n\n**Defense Evasion**\n\n\n**Discovery**\n\n\nt1134 Access Token Manipulation\n\n\nt1087 Account Discovery\n\n\nt1009 Binary Padding\n\nt1146 Clear Command History\n\nt1116 Code Signing\n\nt1140 Deobfuscate / Decode Files or Information\n\nt1089 Disabling Security Tools\n\nt1038 DLL Search Order Hijacking\n\nt1073 DLL Side-Loading\n\nt1107 File Deletion\n\nt1054 Indicator Blocking\n\nt1070 Indicator Removal on Host\n\nt1036 Masquerading\n\nt1112 Modify Registry\n\nt1170 Mshta\n\nt1027 Obfuscated Files or Information\n\nt1055 Process Injection\n\nt1014 Rootkit\n\nt1085 Rundll32\n\nt1064 Scripting\n\nt1045 Software Packing\n\nt1099 Timestomp\n\nt1078 Valid Accounts\n\nt1497 Virtualization and Sandbox Evasion\n\nt1102 Web Service\n\n\nt1482 Domain Trust Discovery\n\nt1083 File and Directory Discovery\n\nt1169 Permission Groups Discovery\n\nt1057 Process Discovery\n\nt1063 Security Software Discovery\n\nt1082 System Information Discovery\n\nt1016 System Network Configuration Discovery\n\nt0149 System Network Connections Discovery\n\nt1033 System Owner/User Discovery\n\nt1124 System Time Discovery\n\nt1497 Virtualization and Sandbox Evasion\n\n\nt1090 Connection Proxy\n\nt1094 Custom Command and Control Protocol\n\nt1132 Data Encoding\n\nt1001 Data Obfuscation\n\nt1483 Domain Generation Algorithms\n\nt1219 Remote Access Tools\n\nt1105 Remote File Copy\n\nt1071 Standard Application Layer Protocol\n\nt1032 Standard Cryptographic Protocol\n\nt1095 Standard Non-Application Layer Protocol\n\nt1065 Uncommonly Used Port\n\n\n**Lateral Movement**\n\n\nt1075 Pass the Hash\n\n\nt1076 Remote Desktop Protocol\n\n\nt1105 Remote File Copy\n\n\n**Command and Control**\n\n\nt1043 Commonly Used Port\n\n\n**Credential Access**\n\n\nt1098 Account Manipulation\n\n\nt1110 Brute Force\n\nt1003 Credential Dumping\n\nt1081 Credentials in Files\n\nt1056 Input Capture\n\nt1145 Private Keys\n\n\n**Collection**\n\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\n\nt1119 Automated Collection\n\n\nt1002 Data Compressed\n\n\nt1022 Data Encrypted\n\n\nt1213 Data from Information Repositories\n\nt1005 Data from Local System\n\nt1056 Input Capture\n\n\nt1041 Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel\n\n\nt1113 Screen Capture\n\n\n**Impact**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TECHNICAL ANNEX\n## Code-Signing Certificates\n Used by APT41\n\n\n**Table 14.
