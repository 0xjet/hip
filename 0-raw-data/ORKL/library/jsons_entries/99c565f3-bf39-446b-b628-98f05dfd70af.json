    "plain_text": "# Goznym Indictments – action following on from successful Avalanche Operations\n\n**[shadowserver.org/news/goznym-indictments-action-following-on-from-successful-avalanche-operations/](https://www.shadowserver.org/news/goznym-indictments-action-following-on-from-successful-avalanche-operations/)**\n\nMay 16, 2019\n\n[We have previously reported on multiple phases of the operations against the Avalanche](https://www.shadowserver.org/news/avalanche/)\n[platform, in late November 2016,](https://www.shadowserver.org/news/avalanche/) [2017 and](https://www.shadowserver.org/news/avalanche-year-two-this-time-with-andromeda/) [2018. To recap: Avalanche was a long running](https://www.shadowserver.org/news/avalanche-123/)\ncriminal malware delivery platform that was used to provide difficult to disrupt, fast flux botnet\ncommand and control (C2) capabilities, to over 20 different malware strains. During the past\n3 years, the Shadowserver Foundation has been supporting multiple international Law\nEnforcement Agencies in helping to keep roughly 2 million unique IP addresses of the\nvictims of one or more of these strains protected from cybercrime every day, through court\nordered and voluntary sinkholing of malicious C2 domains and victims remediation via our\n[free daily network reporting,](https://www.shadowserver.org/what-we-do/network-reporting/)\n\nAs part of ongoing investigations into the operators and customers of the Avalanche\nplatform, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI),\ntogether with Europol, Eurojust and many Law Enforcement partners in Germany, Georgia,\n[Ukraine, Moldova and Bulgaria, today announced a significant new case development. The](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/goznym-cyber-criminal-network-operating-out-europe-targeting-american-entities-dismantled)\nmalware known as Goznym was one of the malware strains being controlled through the\nAvalanche platform at the time of the takedown. The Pittsburgh FBI Field Office and LE\npartners have now reached a point in their investigation into Goznym where they can reveal\ntheir work to the world. The Goznym malware and the criminal actors behind it were\nallegedly responsible for over 41,000 infected computers used in $100 million USD of\nattempted fraud. So far 10 suspects have been indicted, with 5 arrested internationally and 5\nstill at large.\n\n[You can view a helpful DoJ/Europol infographic explaining the alleged Avalanche Goznym](https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/goznym-malware-cybercriminal-network-dismantled-in-international-operation)\ncrimes [here, as well as a](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1163081/download) [map showing the location of the indicted defendants. The](https://www.shadowserver.org/news/goznym-indictments-action-following-on-from-successful-avalanche-operations/http:/DoJ%20map%20of%20defendant%20locations:https:/www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1163071/download/)\n[defendants join the FBI’s wanted list. You can view the full DoJ indictment here](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/goznym-subjects)\n\nThe graph below shows the number of unique IP addresses connecting each day to the\nAvalanche sinkhole for active Goznym infections:\n\n\n-----\n\nSeen from [year two onwards:](https://www.shadowserver.org/news/avalanche-year-two-this-time-with-andromeda/)\n\nAnd focusing on the top three countries with victims – Germany, Poland and the United\nStates from year two onwards:\n\nThe treemaps below show the relative distributions of victim populations globally on various\ndates:\n\n**20161131 – Year One, initial operation**\n\n**20171201 – Year Two, first anniversary**\n\n\n-----\n\n**20190515 – Point of Goznym Indictment**\n\nThe animation below shows the changing international locations of Goznym victims globally\neach month since the November 2016 initial Avalanche takedown to the May 2019 US\nDoJ/FBI indictments:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe often find that major cybercrime investigations require effective collaboration and\npartnerships on a truly international scale. Whilst the Internet spans international borders as\nif they were irrelevant, Law Enforcement Agencies still have to work within nation-state legal\nframeworks. These factors provide considerable logistical and legal challenges. So\ncongratulations to all involved in this case for using all of the available tools to best effect. No\none should underestimate the scale of the achievement here.\n\nWe can’t say it any better than the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office Special Agent in Charge –\nRobert Jones: “Successful investigation and prosecution is only possible by sharing\n_intelligence, credit and responsibility. Our adversaries know that we are weakest along the_\n_seams and this case is a fantastic example of what we can accomplish collectively.” We_\nsalute the work in this case and we’re happy to have been able to support this investigation.\n\n[In turn, we would also like to thank all those who support the work of the The Shadowserver](https://www.shadowserver.org/sponsor/)\nFoundation. Your continued support means we can quietly provide Law Enforcement with\n[impartial, free specialist advice and assistance to help them achieve these major successes](https://www.shadowserver.org/who-we-serve/law-enforcement/)\nand reduce the exposure to risk faced by Internet users.\n\n[Botnets](https://www.shadowserver.org/topics/botnets/)\n[Bots](https://www.shadowserver.org/topics/bots/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Malware](https://www.shadowserver.org/topics/malware/)\n[Takedowns](https://www.shadowserver.org/topics/takedowns/)\n\n[« Back to News & Insights](https://www.shadowserver.org/news-insights/)\n\n\n-----",
