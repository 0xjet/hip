Malicious spam (malspam) from Emotet spoofs legitimate senders to trick potential\nvictims into running malicious files.\n\nAdditionally, Emotet uses IP address 0.0.0.0 in spambot traffic, possibly attempting to hide\nthe actual IP address of an Emotet-infected host.\n\nThis ISC diary reviews the spoofed 0.0.0.0 address used in a recent Emotet infection from\nTuesday 2022-01-18.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: 0.0.0.0 in DNS queries from an Emotet-infected host._\n\n**_Scenes from an infection_**\n\nBoth Emotet botnets (dubbed by researchers as \"epoch 4\" and \"epoch 5\") resumed activity\nafter the recent holiday season, and malicious spam started approximately one week ago on\n[Tuesday 2022-01-11.](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2022/01/11/index.html)\n\nMost Windows hosts I've infected with Emotet in my lab will start spamming within an hour or\nless after the initial infection. Refer to the images below for activity from a recent Emotet\ninfection on 2022-01-18.\n\n_Shown above: Screenshot from malspam pushing Emotet on Tuesday 2022-01-18._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Web page from link in the malspam._\n\n_Shown above: Example of downloaded Excel spreadsheet for Emotet._\n\nEnable macros in a downloaded spreadsheet, and they will infect a vulnerable Windows\nhost. This is standard operating procedure for Emotet.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Traffic from an infection filtered in Wireshark._\n\n_Shown above: Spambot activity started approximately 27 minutes after the initial infection._\n\n**_Emotet spambot traffic using 0.0.0.0_**\n\nRight as the spambot activity starts, the following DNS queries are made using domains\nrelated to spam filtering:\n\n**_0.0.0.0.spam.abuse.ch_**\n**_0.0.0.0.b.barracudacentral.org_**\n**_0.0.0.0.bl.mailspike.net_**\n**_0.0.0.0.spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net_**\n**_0.0.0.0.zen.spamhaus.org_**\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilar DNS queries, but without the 0.0.0.0, are generated during Trickbot infections.\nHowever, Trickbot uses the infected host's public IP address data in the DNS query. Here is\nan example from analysis of a Trickbot sample (scroll down to the \"Domains\" list).\n\n_Shown above: 0.0.0.0-related DNS queries from an Emotet-infected host._\n\nIn addition to DNS queries, Emotet uses 0.0.0.0 during SMTP communications. This\nhappens whenever an Emotet-infected host tries sending malspam to a targeted mailserver.\nThe SMTP command is EHLO [0.0.0.0].\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: SMTP traffic using EHLO [0.0.0.0]._\n\nThis attempt does not hide the actual IP address of an Emotet-infected host, because it still\nappears elsewhere in the SMTP traffic (blurred in the above image, for example). But 0.0.0.0\ncan be an indicator of emails pushing Emotet or other malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Example of Emotet malspam with 0.0.0.0 in the email headers._\n\n**_Final words_**\n\nWhile 0.0.0.0 is an indicator for Emotet or other malware, you can find up-to-date indicators\nfor Emotet malware samples, URLs, and C2 IP addresses at:\n\n[https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/browse/tag/emotet/](https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/browse/emotet/)\n[https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/browse/emotet/](https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/browse/emotet/)\n[https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/tag/Emotet/](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/tag/Emotet/)\n[https://threatfox.abuse.ch/browse/malware/win.emotet/](https://threatfox.abuse.ch/browse/malware/win.emotet/)\n\n--\nBrad Duncan\n\nbrad [at] malware-traffic-analysis.net\n\n[Keywords: Emotet](https://isc.sans.edu/tag.html?tag=Emotet)\n[0 comment(s)](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/0000+in+Emotet+Spambot+Traffic/28254/)\n\nJoin us at SANS!
