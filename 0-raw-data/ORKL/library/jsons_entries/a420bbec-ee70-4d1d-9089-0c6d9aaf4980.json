In late March 2021,\nIntezer[2] tweeted a hash of what was described as a fully undetectable (FUD) version of\nELF_PLEAD.\n\nThis post will cover a few updates to the PLEAD backdoor, some that have been publicized,\nand some that I found while analyzing the file.\n\n## Targeting the Penguin\n\nBlackTech has an extensive malware repo and is best known for utilizing network and\nsoftware exploits for initial access. Continued development and refinement of tooling\nspecifically for Linux systems is just another notch in the belt of BlackTech. In March of 2020,\n\n\n-----\n\nJPCert[3] again identified a Linux Variant of BlackTech s TSCookie loader.\n\nThe following month in April, TeamT5[4] released a blog post detailing an intrusion at a\nTaiwan academic institution attributed to BlackTech utilizing the Ghostcat vulnerability, (CVE2020-1938) for initial access. The file later found on the compromised institution’s network\nwas identified as a Unix variant of Bifrose, or Bifrost, a backdoor associated with BlackTech.\n\n**Updated PLEAD characteristics:**\n\n64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, for GNU/Linux\n2.6.18.\n\nShared libraries:\n\nglibc 2.2.5, glibc 2.3, glibc2.4 > GNU C Libraries\nlibcrypto.so.10\nlibssl.so.10\n\nThe libcrypto* and libssl* libraries are older versions of OpenSSL libraries for RedHat Linux\ndistributions. Previous versions of ELF_PLEAD were statically linked, meaning all\ndependencies are stored within the binary, however, this also means a larger file size.\n\nOne thing that hasn’t changed between the PLEAD versions is the stripping of symbol\ninformation in the binary. Malware developers commonly strip the symbol information to\nhamper analysis efforts. Figure 1 depicts the binary with a stripped Symbol Table, however,\nwe can still glean plenty of information from the file.\n\nFigure\n\n1\n*Note: The script myelf_parser.py is a personal project of mine to learn about working with\nELF binaries in Python.\n\nNot visible in this file include the Symbol Table (.symtab), the Dynamic Symbol Table\n(.dynsym) which contains libc functions that can give us a glimpse into the capabilities of the\nbackdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe functions visible in Figure 1 hint that the binary makes a connection to some\ninfrastructure using SSL, and has the ability to execute some commonly known Unix OS\ncommands.\n\nFigure 2 Hardcoded C2 IPv4 address\nThe backdoor connects to an IP (168.95[.]1.1) address we will later see in Figure 3 is located\nin Taiwan, a known target for BlackTech. It is likely the location of the command and control\ninfrastructure is to blend in with the targeted network, as to not raise alarms.\n\nThe backdoor described in the November 2020 post utilized the domain mx[.]msdtc.tw for\ncommand and control.\n\nOf note, this domain has Yu Liang Lin wufi2011@gmail.com, listed as the registrant. The\nname and email address could very well be a throwaway account, or stolen credentials used\nto register the domain. At the time of writing, there were no other domains associated with\nthe Gmail address.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3\nELF_PLEAD conducts a number of checks to ensure it has landed on the correct target. This\nis important not only for fingerprinting the victim system but also due to the fact that the ELF\nbinary is dynamically linked. In other words, if this were a more recent version of the\noperating system installed, many of the capabilities in PLEAD would be rendered useless.\n\nFigure 4\n\n## ELF_Plead Commands\n\nSimilar to the ELF_PLEAD sample JPCert identified this updated version is outfitted with\nseven separate command groups. The command and command numbers that differ from the\nprior sample are listed below:\n\n11C SockClient >> Client/Server proxy mode\n\n\n-----\n\n11C TravClient\n\nMany of the same commands including file operations, remote shell, and proxy modes are\nfound in this version of PLEAD. Figure 5 provides some of the aforementioned commands\nused to navigate through the compromised system.\n\nFigure 5\nThe backdoor contains the ability to create a new thread and provide the operator with a\npseudo-terminal (tty) shell. Shell commands are executed using “echo -e”, additional\nfunctions called are described below.\n\n“[!] monitor %d %d”\n“[!] openpty %d”\n“[!] ttyname %d”\n“[!] ioctl %d”\n“[!] fork %d %d”\n\n**Featured Image: Photo by Claudio Schwarz on Unsplash\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHope you enjoyed this quick analysis!\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOC)\n\nSHA256: 3fefceeab9f845f9ddbe9c3a0712d45aad4c87fdbb178d13955944dbe6b338a3\n\nIP: 168.95.1[.]1\n\n## References\n\n\n-----\n\n[1] [https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2020/11/elf-plead.html](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2020/11/elf-plead.html)\n\n[2] [https://twitter.com/IntezerLabs/status/1373977739347300353](https://twitter.com/IntezerLabs/status/1373977739347300353)\n\n[3] [https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2020/03/elf-tscookie.html](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2020/03/elf-tscookie.html)\n\n[4] https://teamt5.org/tw/posts/technical-analysis-on-backdoor-bifrost-of-the-Chinese-aptgroup-huapi/\n\n\n-----",
