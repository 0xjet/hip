The Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) research team is publicly\nsharing insights about the IRON LIBERTY threat group, as well as details about the\n[Karagany and](https://www.secureworks.com/research/updated-karagany-malware-targets-energy-sector) [MCMD malware used exclusively by IRON LIBERTY, to supplement the](https://www.secureworks.com/research/mcmd-malware-analysis)\n\n\n-----\n\n[discussion of the man-on-the-side technique described in the Secureworks Incident](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/own-the-router-own-the-traffic)\nResponse Insights Report 2019.\n\n## Summary\n\nSince at least 2010, the IRON LIBERTY threat group (also known as TG-4192, Energetic\nBear, Dragonfly, and Crouching Yeti) has targeted the energy sector with a particular focus\non industrial control systems (ICS). Following public disclosures in 2014, the likely Russian\ngovernment group became less visibly active, but by 2016 it resumed operations with a\ncombination of new and old techniques and tools. Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™\n(CTU) researchers' in-depth analysis of the group's capabilities and targeting revealed an\nevolving threat to the energy sector and ICS systems, and to the defense and nuclear\nindustries.\n\n## Background\n\n[In mid-2014, a number of public disclosures by security researchers highlighted the activity](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/dragonfly-western-energy-companies-under-sabotage-threat-energetic-bear)\nof a threat group that CTU™ researchers refer to as IRON LIBERTY. This group had been\nactive since at least 2010. Although its targeting was broad, it had a specific interest in the\nenergy sector, including energy companies and organizations financing the energy sector, in\nthe U.S. and Europe. The longevity of the threat group's campaign, the nature of the\ntargeting, and active development of a custom toolset strongly suggested the group was\nresourced and operated by a government. Technical indicators coupled with IRON\nLIBERTY's focus on the energy sector, especially in Europe, led CTU researchers to assess\nthat IRON LIBERTY was likely operated by or on behalf of the Russian government. This\nfocus on energy organizations, including suppliers, could align with Russian government\nintelligence priorities in support of its energy export-based economy.\n\nPrior to 2014, IRON LIBERTY used custom malware, primarily Sysmain, Havex, and xFrost\n(now known as Karagany), combined with commodity penetration testing and tools. IRON\nLIBERTY was known for compromising targets via strategic web compromises (SWCs) using\na custom exploit kit, through spearphishing campaigns, and by trojanizing legitimate\ninstallers that are then hosted on legitimate vendor app stores. In 2014, the group embedded\nHavex into legitimate remote management software for ICS and created industrial control\nscanning and enumeration modules.\n\n[Public disclosures in 2014 revealed likely IRON LIBERTY activity. The group was reportedly](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bmjdmd/hackers-target-300-norwegian-oil-and-energy)\n[involved with breaches of Norwegian oil and gas companies. It was also deemed responsible](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/dragonfly-western-energy-companies-under-sabotage-threat-energetic-bear)\nfor similar compromises in the U.S., the UK, and Canada. CTU researchers assessed that\nIRON LIBERTY's goal was to gather intelligence on the energy sector (particularly in Europe)\nto assist Russian government and corporate decision-making, and to gain access to energylinked ICS for early-stage reconnaissance and potentially as pre-positioning for sabotage\n\n\n-----\n\noperations. Government-affiliated threat groups are typically not deterred by public\ndisclosures, so CTU researchers expected IRON LIBERTY to reemerge with new malware\nand infrastructure.\n\nThe plugins deployed by Karagany malware compiled in 2018 contain links and similarities to\ntools used by the IRON LYRIC threat group (also known as TeamSpy) in 2012 and 2013,\nsuggesting that IRON LYRIC and IRON LIBERTY share at least some of their codebase.\nIRON LYRIC was last active in 2013, and CTU analysis suggests that it was operated by a\n[Russian intelligence service. The group covertly installed the TeamViewer desktop-sharing](https://portal.secureworks.com/portal/intel/tip/6735)\ntool to surveil individuals.\n\n## The CASTLE campaign\n\nIn May 2017, CTU researchers began tracking a campaign that used spearphishing and\nSWCs to target the energy sector. Although the campaign was similar to earlier IRON\nLIBERTY operations, there were no technical links to IRON LIBERTY. As a result, CTU\nresearchers assigned the name CASTLE to the cluster of activity identified in this campaign.\nSome [reporting indicates that the CASTLE campaign began as early as December 2015. By](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks)\nlate 2016, it was in full swing.\n\nReminiscent of IRON LIBERTY's 2010-2014 activity, the CASTLE campaign used\ncompromised energy sector websites and spearphishing emails tailored for the energy and\nICS industry to target individuals working in those sectors (see Figure 1). In contrast to the\nearlier activity, CASTLE did not install malware on the victim's system. Instead, it employed a\n[technique that tricked the victim's system into making an SMB request to a CASTLE-](http://www.securitynewspaper.com/2017/05/17/can-steal-windows-login-credentials-via-google-chrome-scf-files/)\ncontrolled server, allowing CASTLE to harvest the logged-in user's account name and NTLM\n[password hash sent with the request. Media reporting indicated that the threat actors](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/07/template-injection.html)\n[modified an open-source tool called Phishery to perform template injection, in which the](https://github.com/ryhanson/phishery)\nspearphishing email tricks the target system into requesting a remote template via SMB. The\nharvested credentials could allow the threat actors to access the target environment via\nsingle-factor authenticated Internet-facing services such as terminal services, a virtual\nprivate network (VPN), or corporate webmail.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. CASTLE spearphishing lure document. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n### Linking CASTLE to IRON LIBERTY\n\nThe UK's [National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the United States Computer Emergency](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/alerts/hostile-state-actors-compromising-uk-organisations-focus-engineering-and-industrial-control)\n[Readiness Team (US-CERT), and](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A) [Symantec link the CASTLE campaign to IRON LIBERTY.](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks)\nSpecifically, Symantec detailed the threat group's use of the Trojan.Heriplor malware. CTU\nresearchers' comparison of Heriplor to an IRON LIBERTY Havex second-stage malware\nsample from 2014 revealed that the two samples wrote identical files and shared a command\nand control (C2) server, suggesting that Heriplor was developed from the Havex code base.\nCTU researchers have no evidence that other threat actors have used Havex or Heriplor.\n\nCTU analysis has not revealed additional evidence linking CASTLE to IRON LIBERTY, but\nthere is no reason to doubt these third-party assessments. The similarity in targeting and\nexecution to previous IRON LIBERTY campaigns led CTU researchers to assess that\nCASTLE was likely a continuation of IRON LIBERTY's activities and was directed by the\nRussian government. Figure 2 shows a timeline of IRON LIBERTY activity between 2010\nand 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. IRON LIBERTY timeline. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n## 2017-2018 intrusion activity patterns\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, CTU researchers observed two distinct patterns of IRON LIBERTY\nintrusion activity: access intrusions and full intrusions.\n\n### Access intrusions\n\nThe first pattern seems to be designed to obtain persistent access to the targeted network\nthrough account compromise and without much use of malware. For example, IRON\nLIBERTY used credentials obtained by capturing SMB requests to obtain access in the\nCASTLE campaign. IRON LIBERTY used stolen credentials and connected to systems using\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) tools.\n\n[Post exploitation, the threat group used open-source tools such as the CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec)\n[penetration testing toolkit, the Mimikatz credential-theft tool, the](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) [Angry IP Scanner IP](https://angryip.org/about/)\naddress and port scanner, and the [PsExec Windows Sysinternals command-execution tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec)\nto move around the network. In one incident, the threat actors were able to acquire domain\n[administrator credentials that allowed them to log on to the target's hypervisor, granting them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor)\nfull access to its virtualized servers. IRON LIBERTY makes efforts to remain undetected in a\ntarget network using tactics such as modifying the configuration of antivirus tools to prevent\ndetection of malware deployed to the network.\n\nTo establish persistent access to a network, IRON LIBERTY created malicious LNK files on\nfile shares commonly accessed by the target organization's employees. When a user's\nsystem mounts these shares, the LNK file makes an external SMB request with the user's\nusername and NTLM password hash to an IRON LIBERTY server. This data provides the\n\n\n-----\n\nthreat group with a constantly updated list of credentials. For additional access to a target\nnetwork, IRON LIBERTY has installed web shells on a target's Microsoft Exchange server.\nThe Z_webshell is written in ASPX and seems proprietary to this threat group.\n\n### Full intrusions\n\nThis pattern involves full exploitation of systems on the target network to steal information for\nespionage purposes. CTU researchers have observed IRON LIBERTY using this pattern\nduring intrusions targeting energy, nuclear, and defense organizations. CTU researchers\nhave been unable to confirm the initial access vector for these full intrusions. The threat\nactors may have used access intrusions against a related organization, such as a supplier, or\nmay have leveraged a trojanized Adobe Flash installation file. In at least one case, a user\nwas served an installer from what appear to be valid Adobe Flash download URL. However,\nthe size of the data download was larger than the file that was saved to disk, suggesting that\nmalicious content may have been served alongside the legitimate installer. The trojanized\ninstaller may have self-modified shortly after execution to remove all but minute traces of the\nmalicious content, leaving only a legitimate Adobe Flash installer binary on disk.\n\nAfter establishing initial access, IRON LIBERTY typically deployed the Karagany malware. In\nmany cases, the threat group also used the MCMD remote access tool to download and\ninstall the open-source SoftEther VPN application. By using legitimate VPN software to set\nup TLS-encrypted bridges from its C2 infrastructure to target systems, IRON LIBERTY was\nable to hide its network traffic without deploying additional custom malware. IRON LIBERTY\nhas also used compromised service accounts to access systems in order to install and\nupgrade Karagany malware, sometimes remotely via PsExec.\n\nIn several cases, IRON LIBERTY executed ProcDump via PsExec to dump the lsass.exe\n(Windows Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process shortly before installing\nKaragany on a target system. This process dump contains all hashed account credentials,\nincluding credentials for the primary user and potentially for administrator and service\naccounts. These credentials can then be cracked locally using Mimikatz or removed from the\nenvironment for offline cracking. CTU researchers observed these process dumps being\ncompressed with rar.exe, which aligns with an intent to exfiltrate the files for offline password\ncracking. IRON LIBERTY leveraged these credentials to hide its intrusion activity. Installing\nand running malware in the context of the system's primary domain user is less likely to\nstand out than repeated use of compromised service accounts across multiple hosts.\n\nThe threat group's malware is also designed to hamper incident response analysis.\nKaragany deletes unneeded plugins and files, although evidence of staged exfiltrated data\ncan sometimes still be identified forensically. The C2 servers for the MCMD malware\nincludes a self-destruct script that attempts to wipe evidence of the tool from the\ncompromised system.\n\n\n-----\n\nBecause IRON LIBERTY used a VPN to access systems, CTU researchers were only able to\npiece together a partial view of the information the threat actors stole from compromised\nnetworks. Examination of leftover artifacts in the Karagany malware folder structure revealed\nfile listings and key logs on victims' systems. The nature of the documentation indicates that\nIRON LIBERTY has a broad interest in energy generation and supply, as well as defense\nprojects. Some of the victimology suggests that individuals might have been targeted based\non Active Directory role descriptions or relationships with other victims, rather than being\ntargeted based on the threat actors' knowledge of the organizations' structure or personnel.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIRON LIBERTY took a hiatus after a series of public disclosures of its infrastructure and\ntools. However, by 2017 it re-emerged as a significant threat, particularly to the energy\nsector.\n\nThe IRON LIBERTY intrusion patterns observed by CTU researchers describe two very\ndifferent operations. The first uses minimal tools to maintain access to a target network, with\npersistence achieved by ensuring a feed of password hashes that can then be replayed\nagainst single-factor remote access solutions. The second pattern is more indicative of a fullblown intelligence operation, using a variety of malware and tools and targeting and\nexfiltrating data for espionage purposes. Some of these tools can be traced back as far as\nIRON LIBERTY's pre-2014 activity.\n\nDue to the differences between the CASTLE campaign, which follows the first pattern, and\nother IRON LIBERTY activity, some [third parties categorize the perpetrators of the CASTLE](https://www.dragos.com/blog/20180510Allanite.html)\ncampaign as separate from IRON LIBERTY. However, the shared targeting of the energy\nsector (particularly ICS companies), and the similar techniques (particularly the use of\nenergy industry SWCs) used by the CASTLE campaign and pre-2014 IRON LIBERTY\nactivity led CTU researchers to link CASTLE to IRON LIBERTY.\n\nIRON LIBERTY's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and time-tested arsenal of\nadvanced capabilities have resulted in successful and operationally secure intrusions that\nspan long time periods. CTU analysis indicates that the threat group continues to enhance\nexisting tools (e.g., Karagany) while developing new tools (e.g., MCMD) to support its\nobjectives. While ICS has been a primary focus of the group's operations, IRON LIBERTY\nalso conducts espionage activities to obtain a wide range of information. The group poses a\nthreat to the ICS community as well as to the defense, nuclear, and energy sectors.\n\n## References\n\nBaird, Sean et al. \"Attack on Critical Infrastructure Leverages Template Injection.\" Cisco\nTalos.
