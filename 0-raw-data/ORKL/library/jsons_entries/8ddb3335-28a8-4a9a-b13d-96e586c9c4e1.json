In this second report from the Information Warfare\nMonitor, we lay out the findings of a 10-month investigation of alleged Chinese cyber spying against\nTibetan institutions.\n\nThe investigation, consisting of fieldwork, technical scouting, and laboratory analysis, discovered a lot more.\n\nThe investigation ultimately uncovered a network of over 1,295 infected hosts in 103 countries.\nUp to 30% of the infected hosts are considered high-value targets and include computers located\nat ministries of foreign affairs, embassies, international organizations, news media, and NGOs. The\nTibetan computer systems we manually investigated, and from which our investigations began,\nwere conclusively compromised by multiple infections that gave attackers unprecedented access to\npotentially sensitive information.\n\nBut the study clearly raises more questions than it answers.\n\nFrom the evidence at hand, it is not clear whether the attacker(s) really knew what they had\npenetrated, or if the information was ever exploited for commercial or intelligence value.\n\nSome may conclude that what we lay out here points definitively to China as the culprit. Certainly\nChinese cyber-espionage is a major global concern. Chinese authorities have made it clear that they\nconsider cyberspace a strategic domain, one which helps redress the military imbalance between\nChina and the rest of the world (particularly the United States). They have correctly identified\ncyberspace as the strategic fulcrum upon which U.S. military and economic dominance depends.\n\nBut attributing all Chinese malware to deliberate or targeted intelligence gathering operations by\nthe Chinese state is wrong and misleading. Numbers can tell a different story. China is presently\nthe world’s largest Internet population. The sheer number of young digital natives online can more\nthan account for the increase in Chinese malware. With more creative people using computers, it’s\nexpected that China (and Chinese individuals) will account for a larger proportion of cybercrime.\n\nLikewise, the threshold for engaging in cyber espionage is falling. Cybercrime kits are now available\nonline, and their use is clearly on the rise, in some cases by organized crime and other private actors.\nSocially engineered malware is the most common and potent; it introduces Trojans onto a system,\nand then exploits social contacts and files to propagate infections further.\n\nFurthermore, the Internet was never built with security in mind. As institutions ranging from\ngovernments through to businesses and individuals depend on 24-hour Internet connectivity, the\nopportunities for exploiting these systems increases.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis report serves as a wake-up call. At the very least, a large percentage of high-value targets\ncompromised by this network demonstrate the relative ease with which a technically unsophisticated\napproach can quickly be harnessed to create a very effective spynet…These are major disruptive\ncapabilities that the professional information security community, as well as policymakers, need to\ncome to terms with rapidly.\n\nThese are major disruptive capabilities that the professional information security community, as well\nas policymakers, need to come to terms with rapidly.\n\n\n**Ron Deibert, Director, the Citizen Lab,**\n**Munk Centre for International Studies,**\n**University of Toronto.**\n\n\n**Rafal Rohozinski, Principal and CEO,**\n**The SecDev Group,**\n**Ottawa, Canada.**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis investigation was prepared by a dedicated team of professionals.\n\nGreg Walton conducted and coordinated the primary field-based research in India, Tibetan Missions\nabroad, and Europe.

Allegations of cyber espionage (computer network\nexploitation) are increasingly common, but there are few case studies in the unclassified realm that\nexpose the inner workings of such networks.\n\nThis study reveals the existence and operational reach of a malware-based cyber espionage network\nthat we call GhostNet.\n\nBetween June 2008 and March 2009 the Information Warfare Monitor conducted an extensive and\nexhaustive two-phase investigation focused on allegations of Chinese cyber espionage against the\nTibetan community.\n\nWe conducted field-based investigations in India, Europe and North America. In India we worked\ndirectly with affected Tibetan organizations, including the Private Office of the Dalai Lama, the\nTibetan Government-in-Exile, and several Tibetan NGOs. In Europe and North America we worked with\nTibetan missions in London, Brussels, and New York. The fieldwork generated extensive data that\nallowed us to examine Tibetan information security practices, as well as capture real-time evidence\nof malware that had penetrated Tibetan computer systems.\n\nDuring the second phase of our investigation, the data was analyzed, and led to the discovery of\ninsecure, web-based interfaces to four control servers. These interfaces allow attacker(s) to send\ninstructions to, and receive data from, compromised computers. Our research team successfully\nscouted these servers, revealing a wide-ranging network of compromised computers. This extensive\nnetwork consists of at least 1,295 infected computers in 103 countries.\n\nSignificantly, close to 30% of the infected computers can be considered high-value and include the\nministries of foreign affairs of Iran, Bangladesh, Latvia, Indonesia, Philippines, Brunei, Barbados\nand Bhutan; embassies of India, South Korea, Indonesia, Romania, Cyprus, Malta, Thailand, Taiwan,\nPortugal, Germany and Pakistan; the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Secretariat,\nSAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation), and the Asian Development Bank; news\norganizations; and an unclassified computer located at NATO headquarters.\n\nThe GhostNet system directs infected computers to download a Trojan known as gh0st RAT that allows\nattackers to gain complete, real-time control. These instances of gh0st RAT are consistently controlled\nfrom commercial Internet access accounts located on the island of Hainan, People’s Republic of China.\n\nOur investigation reveals that GhostNet is capable of taking full control of infected computers,\nincluding searching and downloading specific files, and covertly operating attached devices, including\nmicrophones and web cameras.\n\nThe vector for spreading the GhostNet infection leverages social means. Contextually relevant emails\nare sent to specific targets with attached documents that are packed with exploit code and Trojan\n\n\n-----\n\nhorse programmes designed to take advantage of vulnerabilities in software installed on the target’s\ncomputer.\n\nOnce compromised, files located on infected computers may be mined for contact information,\nand used to spread malware through e-mail and document attachments that appear to come from\nlegitimate sources, and contain legitimate documents and messages. It is therefore possible that the\nlarge percentage of high value targets identified in our analysis of the GhostNet are coincidental,\nspread by contact between individuals who previously communicated through e-mail.\n\nNonetheless the existence of the GhostNet network is a significant fact in and of itself. At the very\nleast, it demonstrates the ease by which computer-based malware can be used to build a robust, lowcost intelligence capability and infect a network of potentially high-value targets.\n\n###### Key findings:\n\n  - **Documented evidence of a cyber espionage network—GhostNet—infecting at least 1,295**\n**computers in 103 countries, of which close to 30% can be considered as high-value**\n**diplomatic, political, economic, and military targets.**\n\n  - **Documented evidence of GhostNet penetration of computer systems containing sensitive**\n**and secret information at the private offices of the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan**\n**targets.**\n\n  - **Documentation and reverse engineering of the modus operandi of the GhostNet**\n**system—including vectors, targeting, delivery mechanisms, data retrieval and control**\n**systems—reveals a covert, difficult-to-detect and elaborate cyber-espionage system**\n**capable of taking full control of affected systems.**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Introduction\n\nComputer network exploitation represents the leading edge of signals intelligence in the information\nage. The proliferation of computer systems throughout governments, businesses, and civic\norganizations represents a boon for would-be cyber spies.\n\nAwareness of cyber vulnerabilities, and even basic information security practices, is in its infancy, and\nlargely absent in most organizations outside of the classified realm. Commercial computer systems, which\nrepresent most of the world’s installed base, are insecure. This lack of security consciousness is reflective\nof the infancy of the information age. The Internet was never designed for security and, for the most part,\nthere has been little incentive for software manufacturers to make security a first priority in the design\nand development of products, many of which are destined for consumer and/or small business use.\n\nThese challenges are present in advanced industrial societies, but are amplified many times over\nin developing countries. Ownership of computers is a relative rarity among many government\ndepartments. Where they exist, they often use grey market or pirated software. Resources are lacking\nto employ properly trained computer professionals, and many staff are barely computer literate. In\nthis context, information security is often a distant priority.\n\nAnd yet, computers in the hands of individuals or at government offices, ministries, embassies, and\ncivic and non-governmental organizations contain information that can be valuable. Files and e-mails\nwith contact information, lists of meetings and attendees, draft position papers, internal PowerPoint\npresentations, organizational budgets, and lists of visitors can represent items of strategic value\nto rivals and enemies. Organizations, like individuals, can be subject to identity theft, leading to\npotentially serious breaches of security.\n\n###### Rise of the cyber spies\n\nLittle is known of the sophistication of state-based cyber espionage capabilities, such as those of the\nUnited States, Israel, and the United Kingdom, all considered leaders in this field. They are assumed\nto be considerable as the security doctrines of these countries treat cyberspace as a strategic domain\nequivalent to that of land, air, sea, and space.[2]\n\nOther powers including China have made cyberspace a key pillar of their national security strategies.\nChina is actively developing an operational capacity in cyberspace, correctly identifying it as the\ndomain in which it can achieve strategic parity, if not superiority, over the military establishments\nof the United States and its allies. Chinese cyber warfare doctrine is well developed, and significant\nresources have been invested by the People’s Liberation Army and security services in developing\ndefensive and offensive capabilities.[3]\n\n2 http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/ojcs/07-F-2105doc1.pdf ; http://www.afa.org/media/reports/victorycyberspace.pdf\n\n3 http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PBZ/is_6_88/ai_n31140190 ; http://www.infowar-monitor.net/modules.php?op=modload&\nname=Archive&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=2&page=1\n\n\n-----\n\nBut the most significant actors in cyberspace are not states. The online engagements that\naccompanied the recent Russia-Georgia conflict in August 2008[4] and Israel’s January 2009 offensive\nin Gaza[5] were carried out by independent attackers. The May 2007 denial of service attacks against\nEstonia[6] resulted in a single conviction of a Russian living in Estonia. Likewise, previous high-profile\ninvestigations of hacking against strategic U.S. targets were never positively attributed to foreign\nintelligence services[7], and in many cases were the work of individuals.[8]\n\nThe contest in the shadows currently underway in cyberspace appears to rely largely on third parties.\nIn numerous instances, including case studies conducted by the Information Warfare Monitor’s sister\nproject, the OpenNet Initiative, third party attackers were responsible for triggering national-level\ncyber events. In Kyrgyzstan (2005)[9], Belarus (2006)[10], during the Russia Georgia war (2008), and\nKyrgyzstan (2009), individuals and/or loose coalitions were responsible for publishing target lists\nand attack tools on semi-private websites. The ensuing “cyclones in cyberspace” were sufficient to\nprecipitate events outside of cyberspace.[11]\n\nInternational cooperation has for the most part focused on establishing capabilities for counteracting\nthe criminal use of cyberspace, and with good reason. In 2009, the FBI estimated that cybercrime is\nresponsible for over $10 billion worth of losses each year.[12] Cybercrime is a relatively low cost, low\nthreshold activity. Techniques such as phishing and targeted malware are easy to construct, and the\nchances of prosecution are minimal given a general lack of international coordination.\n\nThis is slowly changing as national and international authorities become more aware of the threat.\nThe attacks on Estonia, for example, led to the establishment of NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence\nCentre of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia.[13] The International Telecommunication Union has also\nestablished its own specialized agency, IMPACT, designed to aid intelligence sharing and tracking of\n\n4 http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/10/government-and.html ; http://www.slate.com/id/2197514\n\n5 http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0123/p04s03-wome.html\n\n6 http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2008/01/24/man-convicted-in-estonia-cyber-attack\n\n7 For example, a US government investigation of systematic hacking of Department of Defense networks and defence laboratories\ndubbed ‘Titan Rain’ never provided conclusive evidence to substantiate allegations that the hacking was conducted at the behest of\nthe Chinese government. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1098961,00.html\n\n8 A good example is the 1998 ‘Solar Sunrise’ investigation. The evidence gathered by US authorities eventually led to the conviction\nof an Israeli citizen, Ehud Tenebaum, although the involvement of Israeli security services was never proven. http://www.sans.org/\nresources/idfaq/solar_sunrise.php\n\n9 http://opennet.net/special/kg/\n\n10 http://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/ONI_Belarus_Country_Study.pdf\n\n11 http://www.infowar-monitor.net/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=2146\n\n12 http://kn.theiet.org/magazine/issues/0903/hacking-goes-pro-0903.cfm\n\n13 http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2008/05-may/e0514a.html\n\n\n-----\n\nmalicious criminal activity in cyberspace.[14] Countries such as the United States, Russia and China\nhave also entered into bilateral agreements with allied countries and partners.\n\n###### A focus on China\n\nRecent allegations of Chinese cyber espionage largely rely on anecdotal evidence. The most common\nproof provided by victims of these attacks consists of log files or malware that shows connections\nbeing made by infected computers to IP addresses assigned to the People’s Republic of China.\n\nThis kind of evidence is circumstantial at best. Internet usage statistics suggest that focusing on\nChinese instances of information warfare is misleading.[15] With 41% of the world’s Internet users\nlocated in Asia, China alone accounts for the largest national population of Internet users—some 300\nmillion, nearly one-fifth of the global number of users. Coupled with the rapid growth in Chinese use\nof the Internet—a 1,200% increase in the period 2000-2008—this would more than account for the\nrise in instances of Chinese-oriented malware.[16]\n\nAt the same time, however, allegations of Chinese hacking and exploitation of private and\ngovernment computer systems are persistent enough to warrant an evidence-based investigation.\n\nThis report provides such an investigation.\n\n###### Outline of report\n\nThis report is divided into three parts:\n\n**Part one provides a brief introduction to the context and background to this report. We examine past**\nallegations of cyber espionage by China-based actors and the challenge of evidence-based research\nin this field. Part one concludes with a brief description of the methods used in our two-phase\ninvestigation.\n\n**Part two provides a detailed account of the conduct of our investigation. The findings of each phase**\nare presented sequentially.\n\n**Part three analyses the overall findings of the investigation, suggests alternative explanations and**\nassesses the implications.\n\n14 http://www.itu.int/osg/csd/cybersecurity/gca/impact/index.html\n\n15 For global Internet usage statistics please see http://www.internetworldstats.com\n\n16 http://blog.stopbadware.org/2009/03/03/wheres-the-badware\n\n\n-----\n\n## PART ONE: \n### Context and background\n\n\n-----\n\n### Context and background: Alleged Chinese operations in cyberspace\n\nChina has been developing its cyberspace doctrine and capabilities since the late 1990s as part of its military\nmodernization programme. The Chinese doctrine of ‘active defence,’ which is the belief that China must be ready\nto respond to aggression immediately, places an emphasis on the development of cyber warfare capabilities.\n\nThe Chinese focus on cyber capabilities as part of its strategy of national asymmetric warfare involves\ndeliberately developing capabilities that circumvent U.S. superiority in command-and-control warfare.\nThe strategy recognizes the critical importance of the cyber domain to American military and economic\npower and the importance of offensive cyber operations to victory in a modern conflict with the United\nStates. Chinese doctrine also emphasizes the contiguity between military and non-military realms.[17]\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in allegations that China-based hackers are responsible for\nhigh-level penetrations of computer systems in Europe, North America and Asia. Attackers originating\nin China have been accused of infiltrating government computers in the United States, Britain, France,\nGermany, South Korea, and Taiwan. China-based hackers have been accused of data theft from foreign\ngovernment computers and commercial and financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Defense\nreports it is continuously targeted by Chinese attackers, most notably in the series of attacks since 2003\nknown as ‘Titan Rain,’ which targeted the Department of Defense and numerous defence companies.[18]\n\nThere are also allegations of attacks originating from China directed against non-governmental\norganizations active in regions where China has a national interest. This includes organizations\nadvocating on the conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan,[19] Tibetan groups active in India, and the\nFalun Gong. The majority of attacks involve website defacements, denial of service attacks, or virus\nwriting campaigns. Nationalistic and patriotic cyber-activity by Chinese nationals intensifies during\ncrises, such as during Sino-American or Sino-Taiwanese tensions (see below). To date none of these\nattacks have been traced back to Chinese state authorities or specific individuals, although many\nhave benefited official Chinese policy and interests.\n\n17 http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PBZ/is_6_88/ai_n31140190 ; http://www.infowar-monitor.net/modules.php?op=modload&na\nme=Archive&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=2&page=1 ; http://www.heritage.org/Research/asiaandthepacific/upload/bg_2106.pdf\n\n18 http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1098961,00.html ; http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PBZ/is_6_88/\nai_n31140190 ; http://www.afa.org/media/reports/victorycyberspace.pdf\n\n19 http://www.insidetech.com/news/articles/1630-mysterious-forces-hack-pro-tibet-save-darfur-sites ; http://www.washingtonpost.\ncom/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/20/AR2008032003193.html\n\n\n-----\n\n### Applying the evidence-based approach to cyber attacks: the challenge of attribution\n\nDetermining those responsible for cyber attacks, commonly known as the attribution problem, is\na major challenge. The Internet was never built with security as a priority. The current version of\nthe Internet’s address assignment system, IP V4, provides a wealth of loopholes and methods by\nwhich a perpetrator can mask his or her real identity and location. Online identities and servers\ncan be cleverly hidden. Packet flows and connections can be masked and redirected through\nmultiple servers. A clever attacker can often hijack a machine belonging to an otherwise innocent\norganization and use it as a base for launching attacks.\n\nHand-in-hand with the problem of attribution is the difficulty of identifying motivating factors\nbehind a cyber attack. Many perpetrators of Internet-based attacks and exploits are individuals whose\nmotivation can vary from a simple profit motive through to fear of prosecution or strong emotional\nfeelings, including religious belief and nationalism. Many cyber attacks and exploits which seem to\nbenefit states may be the work of third-party actors operating under a variety of motivations. This\nmakes it difficult to separate the motivation of the individual from the potential motives of the\nparty on whose behalf the attacks have occurred, or a prospective client to which the perpetrator\nis trying to market his or her wares. In either case, the challenge of identifying perpetrators and\nunderstanding their motives gives state actors convenient plausible deniability and the ability to\nofficially distance themselves from attacks.\n\nCyber campaigns can also take on a life of their own. Even though a state might ‘seed’ a particular\ncampaign through tacit encouragement or the absence of sanctions or prosecutions, these campaigns\nare inherently chaotic and unpredictable in scope and outcome.[20] Phenomena such as spontaneous\n‘cyber rioting’ can surpass the initial purposes of the cyber campaign. Low barriers to entry to this\nsort of activity enable anyone with a computer and Internet connection to take part in a cyberattack.[21] For the most part, governments appear to passively benefit from online manifestations of\nnationalistic and patriotic fervour, although outcomes are inherently unpredictable.[22]\n\nIn China, the authorities most likely perceive individual attackers and their online activities as\nconvenient instruments of national power.[23] A favourite target of Chinese hackers is Taiwanese\ncomputer systems, especially during times of Sino-Taiwanese tensions, such as elections and\n\n20 http://www.yorku.ca/robarts/projects/canada-watch/obama/pdfs/Deibert.pdf\n\n21 http://worldanalysis.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=343\n\n22 For instance, during the Russia-Georgia conflict in August 2008, tools were made available online for those who wished to\nparticipate in the ongoing ‘cyber-war’ against Georgian websites. http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/10/government-and.html ;\nhttp://www.slate.com/id/2197514\n\n23 http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PBZ/is_6_88/ai_n31140190 ; http://fmso.leavenworth.army.mil/documents/Beijingsrising-hackers.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\nreferendums.[24] In April 2001, following the death of a Chinese fighter pilot after a collision with an\nAmerican spy plane near the Chinese island of Hainan, Chinese hackers began a sustained campaign\nto target American computer networks. No link was made with elements of the Chinese government.[25]\n\nHowever, governments cannot always preserve direct control over such activities; groups can maintain\ntheir freelance and autonomous status and undertake their own cyber initiatives that may not always\nattain official sanction or serve state interests.[26]\n\n### Targeting Tibet\n\nAccusations of Chinese cyber war being waged against the Tibetan community have been\ncommonplace for the past several years. The Chinese government has been accused of orchestrating\nand encouraging such activity as part of a wider strategy to crack down on dissident groups and\nsubversive activity.[27] Earlier research has traced these attacks against Tibetan groups to IP addresses\nregistered in the People’s Republic of China. The attacks used malware hidden in legitimate-looking\nemail messages, infecting unsuspecting users’ computers and exploiting the data on it by sending it\nto control servers.[28]\n\nThe identity of the attackers has never been attributed in a conclusive manner to any specific group\nor individual.[29] The motivation of those behind the attacks, despite conjecture, is also unproven.\n\nIn earlier studies, researchers focused on attacks specifically targeting the Tibetan community.\nBut a wide variety of other victims of computer penetrations have reported infections similar to\nthose used against Tibetan organizations, following a similar modus operandi and also reporting\nto control servers usually located in China. These additional targets include the Falun Gong[30], the\nU.S. Government, and multinational corporations.[31] While reports of these targeted attacks have\ncirculated, the extent to which attackers successfully exploited the affected computers is unknown.\n\n24 http://fmso.leavenworth.army.mil/documents/Beijings-rising-hackers.pdf\n\n25 http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1305755.stm\n\n26 http://fmso.leavenworth.army.mil/documents/Beijings-rising-hackers.pdf\n\n27 http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/21/AR2008032102605.html\n\n28 See, http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=4177 ; http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=4176 and http://archive.cert.uni-stuttgart.\nde/isn/2002/09/msg00086.html for background information on these attacks.\n\n29 Attribution for previous penetrations of Tibetan groups has never been publicly attributed and is not available from open sources.\nClassified studies may reveal a finer grained detail, as many of the attacks are relatively unsophisticated, and given proper assets,\ncould be traced back to specific locations and presumably individuals.\n\n30 Research by Maarten Van Horenbeeck shows that similar attacks have targeted the Falun Gong. http://www.daemon.be/\nmaarten/Crouching_Powerpoint_Hidden_Trojan_24C3.pdf and http://isc.sans.org/presentations/SANSFIRE2008-Is_Troy_Burning_\nVanhorenbeeck.pdf\n\n31 See http://www.businessweek.com/print/magazine/content/08_16/b4080032218430.htm\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conduct of the investigation\n\nFrom June 2008 to March 2009 the Information Warfare Monitor conducted an in-depth investigation\nof alleged cyber espionage against the Tibetan community. We chose this case study because of the\nunprecedented access that we were granted to Tibetan institutions through one of our researchers, and\npersistent allegations that confidential information on secure computers was somehow being compromised.\nOur lead field investigator had a long history of working with the Tibetan community, and was able\nto work with the private office of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, and a number of\nTibetan non-governmental organizations.\n\nThe investigation consisted of two distinct phases.\n\n**Phase 1: Field-based investigations in India, Europe, and North America (June-November 2008)**\n\nField research was carried out in Dharamsala, India, the location of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile.\nFollow-up research was conducted at Tibetan missions abroad in London, Brussels and New York. During\nthis phase we had unprecedented access to the Tibetan government and other Tibetan organizations.\nThis allowed us to establish a baseline understanding of information security practices at these\nlocations and to design an evidence-based approach to the investigation.\n\nWe also conducted extensive on-site interviews with officials in the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, the\nprivate office of the Dalai Lama, and Tibetan non-governmental organizations. The interviews focused on\nthe allegations of cyber espionage. We also sought alternative explanations for leakage of confidential\ndocuments and information and examined basic information security practices at these locations.\n\nNetwork monitoring software was installed on various computers so as to collect forensic technical\ndata from affected computer systems, and initial results were analysed in situ.[32] This initial analysis\nconfirmed the existence of malware and the transfer of information between infected computers and\na number of control servers.[33]\n\n**Phase 2: Computer-based scouting, target selection, and data analysis (December 2008-March 2009)**\n\nDuring the second phase of the investigation, researchers based at the Citizen Lab analysed the data\ncollected by the field team.\n\nThe data collected in Dharamsala and at Tibetan missions abroad led to the discovery of four control\nservers and six command servers. These control servers were identified and geo-located from the captured\n\n32 A portion of the fieldwork was carried out in conjunction with Dr. Shishir Nagaraja who spent five days in Dharamsala at the request\nof IWM researchers and assisted in conducting technical tests.\n\n33 A packet capturing program, Wireshark, was installed at each test location. All traffic from each of the affected systems was\ncaptured in real-time, and recorded for further analysis. Compromised systems try to connect to control servers in order check-in and\nreport an infection. Once a connection is made, infected computers may receive instructions or additional locations from where they\nare to download instructions. The Wireshark data is sufficient to analyse these connections, determine the behaviour of the attack\nvector, and identify the location of control servers.\n\n\n-----\n\ntraffic using a simple IP lookup.[34] The control servers were then probed and web-based control interfaces\nwere identified on four control servers, which allowed us to view and control the network. The system was\nactively monitored for two weeks, which allowed us to derive an extensive list of infected systems, and to\nalso monitor the systems operator(s) as the operator(s) specifically instructed target computers.\n\nThe data collected during both phases was integrated in Palantir, a data visualization and analysis\ntool. The Palantir platform provides a data fusion and visualization environment that enhances\nanalytical capabilities.\n\n34 We looked up the associated Internet Protocol (IP) address in all five Regional Internet Registries in order to identify the country\nand network to which the IP address is assigned. We then performed a reverse Domain Name System (DNS) look-up on each IP\naddress. DNS is the system that translates domain names into IP addresses; reverse DNS is a system that translates an IP address\ninto a domain name. This can potentially provide additional information about the entity that has been assigned a particular IP\naddress. If we discovered a domain name, we then looked up its registration in WHOIS, which is a public database of all domain\nname registrations and provides information about who registered the domain name.\n\n\n-----\n\n## PART TWO: \n### Tracking GhostNet\n\n\n-----\n\n### Phase 1: Field investigation\n\nWe conducted our investigation in Dharamsala between July and September 2008. The initial purpose\nwas to gather targeted malware samples from Tibetan NGOs based in the area and to brief the Tibetan\nGovernment-in-Exile (TGIE) on the basics of information security. This included raising end-user\nawareness about social engineering and its policy implications for the secure use of information systems.\n\nThe investigator met with the Dalai Lama’s representative in Geneva, Tseten Samdup. During the\nmeeting, Samdup inquired about the potential threat to computer security at the Office of His\nHoliness the Dalai Lama (OHHDL) in light of the targeted malware threat. Samdup requested that\nthe investigator perform a preliminary security review of OHHDL systems, including Dalailama.com\nand the office computer network. A five day mission was scheduled in early September. Malware\nwas discovered on computers located in the OHHDL.\n\nFollowing the discovery of malware in the OHHDL, our investigator shifted focus to the campus\nnetwork of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile. We approached Thubten Samphel, a senior civil\nservant in the Department for Information and International Relations, and sought permission\nto run Wireshark on several key computer systems, and to access the firewall logs at the Tibetan\nComputing Resource Centre. This access was readily granted.\n\nAdditional testing was carried out at a Tibetan NGO. This was done at the suggestion of Phuntsok\nDorjee, the director of a local NGO, TibTec. Dorjee suggested that we conduct testing and monitoring at\nthe offices of Drewla.[35] As was the case at other sitesthe investigator conducted a series of interviews\nwith the NGO staff.\n\n###### Targeted malware — previous research\n\nIn September 2002, Tibetan groups reported that they were targeted with malware originating\nfrom servers in mainland China. They claimed that this was a coordinated attempt to disrupt their\noperations and spy on their computer networks. Similar attacks have occurred since then against a\nrange of Tibetan non-state actors, including exile groups, human rights organizations, trade unions\nand labour organizers, writers, scholars and intellectuals.\n\nIn 2005, a member of our investigating team convened a working group that coordinated the\ncollection and archiving of the malware, including the payloads and associated examples of social\nengineering employed. Since early 2008, we have analysed every sample available to us, and\nidentified control servers for at least fifty incidents.\n\nDuring an analysis of attacks which occurred during the 2008 Beijing Olympics we discovered\nthe location of a control server that was later identified as part of the network which infected a\ncomputer in the private office of the Dalai Lama.\n\n35 The Drewla Initiative Project is an outreach model that seeks new ways to communicate directly with citizens of the People’s\nRepublic of China. It relies heavily on the Internet.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe were able to gain access to the command interface of this control server and identify the\ninfected computers which reported back to this server. While were are unable to prove exactly how\nthe computer in the Dalai Lama’s office became infected, this case demonstrates one of the attack\nvectors used by the attacker(s) behind the network of infected computers we later uncovered.[36]\n\nThe following steps illustrate the attack vector using the malicious document we collected, which was\nconfigured to connect to a control server to which we later acquired access. (See Fig. 1 - p.19)\n\nAn email message arrives in the target’s inbox carrying the malware in an attachment or web link.\nThe attackers(s)’ objective is to get the target to open the attachment or malicious link so that the\nmalicious code can execute. In this case, the attacker(s) sent a carefully crafted email message which\nwas configured to appear as if it was sent from campaigns@freetibet.org with an attached infected\nWord document named “Translation of Freedom Movement ID Book for Tibetans in Exile.doc” to entice\nthe recipient to open the file.[37] (See Fig. 2 - p. 20)\n\nOver time, it has been observed that the carrier emails have become more sophisticated in their\ntargeting and content in order to trick their recipients into believing that they are receiving\nlegitimate messages. This is also known as “social engineering.” It is common to see legitimate\ndocuments recycled for such attacks or the attacker injecting their message into an ongoing group\nconversation. There are also cases where it appears that content stolen from previously-infected\nmachines was recycled to enhance the appearance of legitimacy.\n\nThe targeted user proceeds to opens the attachment or malicious link. Once opened, the infected\nfile or link exploits a vulnerability on the user’s machine and installs the malware on the user’s\ncomputer, along with a seemingly benign file. From the user’s perspective, the infected document\nwill often open normally, leaving the user unaware of the infection that just took place.\n\nOnly 11 of the 34 anti-virus programs provided by Virus Total[38] recognized the malware embedded in\nthe document. Attackers often use executable packers to obfuscate their malicious code in order to\navoid detection by anti-virus software. (See Fig. 3 - p. 21)\n\nResearchers monitoring the use of socially engineered malware attacks against the Tibetan\ncommunity have identified over eight different Trojan families in use.[39] Control over some targeted\nmachines is maintained using the Chinese gh0st RAT (Remote Access Tool). These Trojans generally\nallow for near-unrestricted access to the infected systems.\n\n36 A detailed technical investigation of a similar case of a targeted attack which connected to the same control server is available\nhere: http://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx; another investigation of targeted attacks connecting to the same control\nserver is available here: http://www.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n37 For a detailed list of malicious files and control servers see xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n38 VirusTotal.com is a free, web-based service that allows users to upload malicious files that are scanned with 34 leading anti-virus products.\n\n39 http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=4177\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Fig. 1\n\n A “Social Engineering” attack connects to GhostNet.\n\nThis Palantir screen capture summarizes the relationships between an “unknown sender” pretending to be “campaigns@freetibet.org”, the email\nsent to the International Tibet Support Network, and the attachment (“Translation of Freedom Movement ID Book for Tibetans in Exile.doc”)\nthat contained malware that connected to a GhostNet control server.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Fig. 2\n\n A “Socially Engineered” email sent to the International Tibet Support  Network.\n\nThis email was sent on July 25, 2008 by an unknown attacker pretending to be “campaigns@freetibet.org” to the International Tibet Support\nNetwork. Attached to the message was a Microsoft Word document named “Translation of Freedom Movement ID Book for Tibetans in Exile.doc”\nthat exploits a vulnerability in Word to install malware on the target’s computer system.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Fig. 3\n\n A Virus Total screen capture of a malware infected email attachment.\n\nThis is a screen capture from VirusTotal.com, a free, web-based service that allows users to upload malicious files that are scanned with\nanti-virus products. It shows that only 11 of 34 anti-virus products detected the malicious file (“Translation of Freedom Movement ID Book\nfor Tibetans in Exile.doc”).\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter infecting the target, the Trojan packed in the Word document performed a DNS look-up to\nfind its control server and then connected to that server. This Trojan attempted to connect to\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. This is one of the control servers that we later scouted and was in the same\nTrojan family that infected computers in the Dalai Lama’s private office.\n\nAbout 70% of the control servers behind the attacks on Tibetan organizations are located on IP\naddresses assigned to China. However, servers have also been identified in the United States,\nSweden, South Korea and Taiwan. The host names pointing to these servers are quite often\nconfigured on dynamic DNS services, such as 3322.org. While these services in and of themselves\nare not malicious, they are heavily used in these specific attacks.[40]\n\n###### Information Warfare Monitor field research\n\nIn September and October 2008 the Information Warfare Monitor investigated information security\npractices and alleged cyber espionage activities on the computer systems in various offices related\nto the work of the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan groups. The offices that we investigated were:\nthe Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama (OHHDL), based in Dharamsala, India; the Tibetan\nGovernment-in-Exile (TGIE); various Offices of Tibet (OOT) in New York City, London, Paris, Brussels,\nand Geneva; and the Tibetan activist NGO, Drewla. (See Fig. 4 - p. 23)\n\n###### Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama\n\nThe OHHDL is the personal office of the Dalai Lama. The OHHDL provides secretarial assistance and\nis responsible for all matters related to the Dalai Lama and acts on his behalf. It is worth noting\nthat the OHHDL’s primary responsibilities include organization of the Dalai Lama’s international\nschedule, handling all diplomatic, governmental and personal correspondence, and acting as\nthe liaison between the Dalai Lama and officials of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile (TGIE) and\nthe Offices of Tibet (OOT) worldwide. Therefore the OHHDL’s computer network is continuously\ntransmitting and receiving extremely sensitive data.\n\nWhile the Office does not have any secrets, it is essentially the hub of the Tibetan movement and\nthus handles strategic, time-sensitive communications. Examples of these communications include\nscheduling meetings with world leaders, and, since 2002, coordinating the negotiations between\nthe People’s Republic of China and Dharamsala.\n\nOn September 10, 2008, we used Wireshark to capture packets from an OHHDL computer named\n_xxxxxx. We chose_ _xxxxxxx_ from among 23 computers on the OHHDL internal network due to\ntime constraints and consultations with office staff to identify the computers most likely to be\ninfected, such as those operated by relatively inexperienced users vulnerable to social engineering\ntechniques, or those handling particularly sensitive data.\n\nAn analysis of the data collected reveals that this computer was compromised by malware that was\nin interactive communication with identified control servers. The infected computer connected to\n\n40 http://www.businessweek.com/print/magazine/content/08_16/b4080032218430.htm\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Fig. 4\n\n Field researchers discovered malware at five Tibetan locations.\n\nA Palantir screen capture showing the Tibetan organizations at which we conducted field research and the connections from infected\ncomputers at these locations and various control servers located in China. The locations at which we found evidence of infection are:\nthe Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, the Offices of Tibet in New York City and London and the Tibetan\nactivist NGO, Drewla.\n\n\n-----\n\nfour different IP addresses, each with a somewhat different method. While there are four groupings\nof communications between the infected computer and the control servers, they are related such\nthat there appear to be two distinct families of malware. In both cases, the malware uses the\nprotocol for standard web traffic, HTTP, in order make the network activity appear as if it were\nnormal Internet browsing.\n\nThe first family of malware used HTTP connections to connect to PHP files.[41] Despite connecting\nto different IP addresses and requesting different files, both used the same unique key when\ncommunicating, indicating that they are part of the same family of malware.\n\n1) The malware made connections to a control server on IP address xxxxxxxxxxxx\nusing two host names, xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. The IP address\nxxxxxxxxx is in a range assigned to Hainan-TELECOM (xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx) in China. The malware used HTTP to connect to various PHP files\non the control server in order to update its status and receive instructions about where\nto download commands. The commands are embedded in what appear to be image files\n(e.g. JPEG).\n\n2) The malware made connections to a control server on IP address xxxxxxxxxxx, port\n8000. This IP address reverse resolved to xxxxxxxxxxx.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.\ncom.cn and is in an IP range assigned to Hainan-TELECOM (HAIFU node adsl dialup\nports) in China. The malware used HTTP POST to upload content to the control server.[42]\n\nThe investigation carried out in Phase 2 identified the network of control servers used in this\nparticular attack. The control servers we discovered include the control server used in the welldocumented instances of social malware used frequently against Tibetan targets during the 2008\nOlympics in Beijing.\n\nThe second family of malware used HTTP POST to connect to a CGI[43] script to communicate between\nthe infected computer and the control server. While their functions appear to be different, with one\nmalware focusing on reporting and commands and the other on document retrieval, they are likely part\nof the same family of malware. In addition, the domain names used, www.lookbytheway.net and www.\nmacfeeresponse.org, are registered to the same person, “zhou zhaojun” (losttemp33@hotmail.com).\n\n1) The malware made connections to a control server on IP address 221.5.250.98 using\nthe host name www.lookbytheway.net. The IP address 221.5.250.98 is assigned to\nCNCGROUP-CQ (CNC Group CHINA169 Chongqing Province Network) in China. The\nmalware on the infected computer used HTTP to connect to a file in an attempt to\ninform the control server of the infected computer’s status and to download commands.\n\n41 PHP is a popular scripting language often used in web applications.\n\n42 HTTP POST is a method often used to upload content to a web server.\n\n43 CGI scripts are often written in the Perl programming language.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn one case, the file the infected computer was requesting was not present and the\ninfected computer received a 404 error. However, successful connections were made\nvia HTTP to CGI scripts. The infected computer used HTTP POST to submit data to CGI\nscripts hosted on the control server.\n\n2) The malware made connections to a control server on 218.241.153.61 using the host name\nwww.macfeeresponse.org. The IP address 218.241.153.61 is assigned to BITNET (Beijing\nBitone United Networks) in Beijing, China. The malware on the infected computer used\nHTTP to connect to a file to inform the control server of the infected computer’s status\nand download commands. In addition, connections were made via HTTP to CGI scripts. The\ninfected computer used HTTP POST to submit data to CGI scripts hosted on the control\nserver. Connections to one CGI script appear to inform the control server of the presence of\nparticular documents, while connections to a second CGI script appear to cause the infected\ncomputer to upload documents to the control server using HTTP POST.\n\nInstances of malware that connect to control server locations www.lookbytheway.net and www.\nmacfeeresponse.org have been analysed by security companies.[44] This network extends to a variety\nof domain names including:\n\n    - www.lookbytheway.com – 210.51.7.155\n\n    - www.macfeeresponse.com - 210.51.7.155\n\n    - www.msnppt.net - 221.5.250.98\n\n    - www.msnxy.net - 210.51.7.155\n\n    - www.msnyf.com - 221.5.250.98\n\n    - www.networkcia.com - 210.51.7.155\n\n    - www.indexnews.org - 61.188.87.58\n\n    - www.indexindian.com - 210.51.7.155\n\nDuring the in situ investigation at the Dalai Lama’s private office we observed several documents\nbeing exfiltrated from the computer network and uploaded to www.macfeeresponse.org, including\na document containing thousands of email addresses and one detailing and discussing the Dalai\nLama’s envoy’s negotiating position. (see Fig. 5 - p. 26)\n\nOur investigators did not have access to the stolen documents for reasons of confidentiality.\nHowever, we can assume their significance to Sino-Tibetan negotiations. One example is the fact\nthat GhostNet penetrated computers of organizations involved in China-TGIE negotiations.[45]\n\n44 See, http://www.threatexpert.com/report.aspx?md5=79f7f4695b8878cf1760e8626129ca88 and http://www.threatexpert.com/report.\naspx?md5=ea03a7359505e19146994ad77b2a1e46\n\n45 Lodi Gyari is the lead person designated by the Dalai Lama to coordinate negotiations with the Chinese government. Our invesigator\ninterviewed him in December 2008 in Delhi. We briefed him on our ongoing investigation and offered advice on information security\nwhile engaged in negotiations in Beijing. Lodi Gyari is also the Executive Chairman of the Board of the International Campaign for\nTibet (ICT), an independent Washington-based human rights advocacy group. (Note that our investigation uncovered that seven of\nICT’s computers were compromised by GhostNet).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Fig. 5\n\n Malware retrieving a sensitive document.\n\nThis screen capture of the Wireshark network analysis tool shows an infected computer at the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama uploading a\nsensitive document to one of the CGI network’s control servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Tibetan Government-in-Exile (TGIE)\n\nOn September 11, 2008, Wireshark was used to capture packets from a TGIE computer xxxxxxx. An\nanalysis revealed that this computer was compromised by malware which sent communication to, and\nreceived communication from, control servers.\n\nThe malware made connections to a control server on 221.10.254.248 using the host name 927.\nbigwww.com. The IP address 221.10.254.248 is assigned to CNCGROUP-SC (CNC Group CHINA169\nSichuan Province Network) in China. The malware on the infected computer used HTTP to connect\nto a JPEG file, which was not an image file but instead contains an IP address and port number\n(124.135.97.21:8005). This IP address, 124.135.97.21, is assigned to CNCGROUP-SD (CNC Group\nCHINA169 Shandong Province Network) in China.\n\n###### Offices of Tibet\n\n**London**\nOn October 1, 2008 Wireshark was used to capture packets from a computer in the London OOT. An\nanalysis revealed that this computer was compromised by malware which sent communication to, and\nreceived communication from, control servers.\n\nThe malware made connections to a control server on 58.141.132.66 using the hostname oyd.3322.\norg on port 4501. The IP address 58.141.132.66 is assigned to NamBu TV in Seoul, South Korea. 3322.\norg is a Chinese dynamic domain service.\n\n**New York**\nOn March 3, 2008, Wireshark was used to capture packets from a computer in the New York OOT.\nAn analysis revealed that this computer was compromised by malware which attempted to send\ncommunication to a control server.\n\nThe malware attempted to make a connection to what appears to be a control server at\n125.108.172.81 but there was not an active server at that location. The IP address 125.108.172.81 is\nassigned to CHINANET-ZJ-WZ (CHINANET-ZJ Wenzhou node network) in China.\n\n###### Drewla\n\nFollowing the discovery of targeted malware on the OHHDL, TGIE and OOT networks, we performed\nsimilar analysis on Tibetan NGOs to see if we could identify more infected machines communicating\nwith control servers in China. While we carried out such analysis on a number of NGOs, in this report\nwe focus on Drewla’s network.\n\nThe Drewla (‘connection’ in Tibetan) is an online outreach project was set up in 2005 that employs\nTibetan youth with Chinese language skills to chat with people in mainland China and in the\ndiaspora, raising awareness about the Tibetan situation, sharing the Dalai Lama’s teachings, and\nsupplying information on how to circumvent Chinese government censorship on the Internet.\n\nOn September 12, 2008 Wireshark was used to capture packets from a Drewla computer. An analysis\nrevealed that this computer was compromised by malware which sent communication to, and\n\n\n-----\n\nreceived communication from, control servers.\n\nThe malware made connections to a control server on 221.5.250.98 using the host name www.\nlookbytheway.net. The IP address 221.5.250.98 is assigned to CNCGROUP-CQ (CNC Group CHINA169\nChongqing Province Network) in China. The malware on the infected computer used HTTP to connect\nto a file in an attempt to inform the control server of the infected computer’s status and download\ncommands. The infected computer used HTTP POST to submit data to CGI scripts hosted on the\ncontrol server. (see Fig. 6 - p. 29)\n\n**Box 1.**\n**Chinese Internet SIGINT in practice**\n\n\nDuring the course of our research, we were informed of the following incident. A member of\nDrewla, a young woman, decided to return to her family village in Tibet after working for two\nyears for Drewla. She was arrested at the Nepalese-Tibetan border and taken to a detention\nfacility, where she was held incommunicado for two months. She was interrogated by Chinese\nintelligence personnel about her employment in Dharamsala. She denied having been politically\nactive and insisted that she had gone to Dharamsala for studies. In response to this, the\nintelligence officers pulled out a dossier on her activities and presented her with full transcripts\nof her Internet chats over the years. They indicated that they were fully aware of, and were\nmonitoring, the Drewla outreach initiative and that her colleagues were not welcome to return\nto Tibet. They then released her and she returned to her village.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Fig. 6\n\n The OHHDL and Drewla were infected by the same malware.\n\nThis Palantir screen capture shows the relationship between an infected computer at the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama (OHHDL) and the\nTibetan NGO Drewla. Both attempted to connect to the same control server in the CGI network.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Phase 2: Identifying command and control servers\n\nThis phase of the investigation focused on the discovery of the command and control servers. We\nwere able to identify and connect to the control servers used by the GhostNet by analysing the data\nfrom the OHHDL obtained during the field investigations carried out in Phase 1. During this process\nwe were able to find and access web-based administration interfaces on the control server identified\nfrom the OHHDL data. These servers contain links to other control servers as well as command\nservers, and so therefore we were able to enumerate additional command and control servers.\n\nAfter discovering several instances of malware on these servers, we set up a honey pot computer and\nwere able to identify additional malicious servers by monitoring the traffic generated by our infected\n_honey pot. Using the attacker(s)’ web-based administration interface, we were able to command our_\n_honey pot computer to download gh0st RAT, one of the Trojans used by GhostNet. Eventually, our_\n_honey pot computer established a connection to the attacker(s)’ gh0st RAT client. The attacker(s)_\nproceeded to execute commands on our honey pot. We were able to discover several IP addresses\nwithin a DSL range in Hainan Island (PRC) that the attacker(s) used to communicate with computers\ninfected with gh0st RAT.\n\nFinally, we were able to map out the methods and capabilities of the GhostNet by a triangulated\nanalysis of three sources: 1) data obtained from our collection of socially engineered emails with\nbackdoor attachments, 2) the captured network traffic from Tibetan targets; and, 3) data obtained by\ngaining access to the command and control interface. (see Fig. 7 - p. 31)\n\nWhile analysing the data collected from the infected OHHDL computer (xxxxxxx), we discovered\nweb-based administration interfaces to four control servers. Through some strategic guessing\nconcerning file paths and file names, we were able to access web interfaces to multiple control\nservers. In total, we found 26 instances of the administration interface across the four servers. It\nremains unclear why the attacker(s) did not secure access to the control interface. Perhaps the\nattacker(s) concluded that the file paths and file names could not be easily guessed.\n\nThe control servers’ web interface contains three main components: 1) a listing of all the infected computers\nthat have reported to the control server; 2) an interface to issue commands to the infected computers; and\n3) an interface to monitor pending commands to infected computers and their results when completed.\n\nThe commands issued to the infected computers direct the infected computer to download files\nfrom additional command servers under the attacker(s)’ control. In some cases, these servers act as\ncontrol servers themselves; however, some appear to be used exclusively to host malicious files that\ninfected computers are meant to download. The attacker(s) set commands on the control servers\nthat instruct infected computers to download additional remote administration Trojans, such as\n_gh0st RAT, in order to take complete real-time control of the infected computers._\n\nThree of the four control servers are located in three different locations in China: Hainan,\nGuangdong and Sichuan. One of the control servers is located at a web-hosting company in the\nUnited States. Five of the six command servers are located in mainland China (Hainan, Guangdong,\nSichuan and Jiangsu) and one in Hong Kong.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Fig. 7\n\n The GhostNet control servers.\n\nThis Palantir screen capture shows the GhostNet servers we uncovered and their relationship with the malicious email sent to, 1) the\nInternational Tibet Support Network, 2) the infected computer at the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama; and, 3) the honey pot network set\nup at the Citizen Lab.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe four control servers are:\n\n   - xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, Hainan-TELECOM, CN\n\n   - xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, US\n\n   - xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, CHINANET-GD, CN\n\n   - xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx CHINANET-SC, CN\n\nThe six control/command servers are:\n\n   - xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, CHINANET-HI, CN\n\n   - xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, CUHKNET, HK\n\n   - xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, CHINANET-GD, CN\n\n   - xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, CHINANET-SC, CN\n\n   - xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, CHINANET-JS, CN\n\n   - xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, CHINANET-SC, CN\n\nThe data obtained from WHOIS records concerning domain name registration reveals that most\nof the domains are traceable to the same individual. However, the attacker(s) could have simply\nstolen the domains from someone else, or compromised the servers hosting these domains.\n\n###### Table 1: Domain name registration information\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 25/04/06\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx 26/11/07\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 20/06/08\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx 03/09/08\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n###### List of infected computers (see Fig. 8 - p. 33)\n\nThe Server List interface provides information on each computer infected by the attacker(s)’\nmalware, indicating the name given to the computer (by its owner/operator), its IP address, when\nit was first infected, when it last called home (i.e. the control server), and how many times it\nhas called home. Each infected computer is assigned a unique identification number so that the\ninfected computer can be tracked even when its IP address changes. The page also features a link\nto the Send Command interface, through which the attacker(s) sends instructions to the infected\n\n|xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx|xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|25/04/06|\n|---|---|---|\n|xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx|xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx|26/11/07|\n|xxxxxxxxxxxxx|xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|20/06/08|\n|xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|03/09/08|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Fig. 8\n\n The GhostNet “Server List” interface.\n\nThis screen capture of the GhostNet interface shows all infected computers that have “checked in” with the control server. It has been obscured\nto protect the identity of the victims.\n\n\n-----\n\ncomputers. There is also a button at the top of the page that links to a Command Result page that\nshows the status of the commands sent to the host and their results.\n\nTo corroborate our findings, there was an entry in the Server List page of the infected OHHDL\ncomputer that we analysed during our field investigations outlined in Part One. It contained the\nunique ID, the IP address, computer name, and a link to issue commands to the infected computer.\n\n###### Sending commands\n\nThe Send Command link provided for each entry yields an interface that allows an attacker(s) to\nsend specific commands to the selected infected computer. In addition to a custom command, the\nattacker(s) may choose from a menu of commands, which includes options to download binaries that\nprovide additional functionality (such as keystroke logging or remote administration), acquire system\ninformation (list computer information, software and documents on the computer), or cause the\nmalware to become dormant. (See Fig. 9 - p. 35)\n\nUsing the Send Command interface, the attacker(s) issues instructions to the infected computers to\ndownload malicious files that are disguised as standard image files. As mentioned above, the files\nare most often hosted on additional command servers that appear to be dedicated to hosting these\ninfected files.[46] These command servers contain a variety of files. While the exact function of each\nfile is not known, the file names given to them by the attacker(s) provide some indication of their\nfunctionality. There are file names associated with the retrieval of files as well as keystroke logging.\n\nOne of the commands available to the attacker(s) instructs infected computers to download the\n_gh0st RAT remote administration tool, which gives the attacker(s) full, real-time control of the infected_\ncomputer. Gh0st RAT is an open source Trojan that is widely available online. It was developed by\nChinese programmers but has now been translated into English. The program allows an attacker to\ncreate an executable file that can be repacked and disguised and used to infect and compromise a target\ncomputer. This file can be configured to directly connect to the gh0st RAT owner or to a third location, a\ncontrol server, when it retrieves the current IP address of the gh0st RAT owner. (See Fig. 10 - p. 36)\n\nOnce the infected computer connects to the gh0st RAT owner, an entry appears in the Connection\nwindow with some information about the infected computer. The gh0st RAT owner may then\nissue commands to the infected computer. These commands include file manager, screen capture,\nkeylogger, remote shell, system, webcam view, audio capture, as well as the ability to force the\ninfected host to download and execute additional malware, such as a gh0st RAT update.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, we infected a honey pot computer with the attacker(s)’\nmalware. We instructed our infected computer to download the attacker(s)’ version of gh0st RAT\nusing the malicious network’s web-based administration interface. The gh0st RAT attempted to\nconnect to several *.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.com.cn IP addresses before finally successfully\nconnecting to xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.com.cn).\n\n46 In some cases the malicious image files are hosted on the control servers themselves.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Fig. 9\n\n The GhostNet “Send Command” interface.\n\nThis screen capture of the GhostNet interface shows how the attacker(s) can send specific commands to infected computers. It has been\nobscured to protect the identity of the victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Fig. 10\n\n The gh0st RAT interface.\n\nThis screen capture of the English language version of the gh0st RAT software shows the commands that an attacker is able to execute on the\ncompromised computer.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The gh0st RAT tool attempts to connect to IP addresses of a DSL provider in Hainan, China:_\n\n    - xxxxxxxxxxxx.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.com.cn\n\n    - xxxxxxxxxxxx.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.com.cn\n\n    - xxxxxxxxxxxx.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.com.cn\n\n    - xxxxxxxxxxxx.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.com.cn\n\n    - xxxxxxxxxxxx.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.com.cn\n\n    - xxxxxxxxxxxx.broad.hk.hi.dynamic.163data.com.cn\n\nAfter a successful connection, the attacker(s) proceed to issue commands on our infected\ncomputer in real-time.\n\nWe found similar but unsuccessful connections to the same IP address range from some of the\ninfected computers we analysed and discovered that a rudimentary version of the web-based\nadministration interface contained only one infection from the same IP address range in Hainan.\nIn addition, one of the servers used to host the attacker(s)’ malicious files is a Government of\nHainan web server located in Hainan, and one of the control server interfaces we gained access\nto is also located in Hainan. However, one should not rush to judgement concerning the identity\nof the attacker(s) based on this location. The gh0st RAT software can be configured with a proxy\nserver; therefore it is possible that the attacker(s) were using a compromised system as a proxy to\nhide their true location.\n\n###### Command results\n\nThe Command Result page lists the commands issued through the Send Command page and the\nstatus of those commands. Each entry in this interface shows what command was sent to the\ninfected computer, including the URL to the command server and the command file (the malicious\nfile disguised as an image). Upon the successful completion of a command, the relevant date, time,\nand result are recorded. (See Fig. 11 - p. 38)\n\nThe Command Result page contains a column that displays the content sent back to the control\nserver from the infected computer. The command issued to retrieve this content in the Send\n_Command interface is labelled “Acquire System Information.” Even though we have been unable_\nto properly decode the content,[47] the plain text values in the binary content indicate that these\nentries contain information about the infected computer (CPU, memory, operating system,\nprogrammes installed) as well as file names of documents on the computer, presumably for later\nretrieval. This information is likely used to determine which targets the attacker(s) will further\nexploit and control using remote administration tools such as gh0st RAT.\n\n47 The content is base64 encoded and XORed with values we have yet to identify.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Fig. 11\n\n The GhostNet “List Command” interface.\n\nThis screen capture of the GhostNet interface lists the commands issued to infected computers. It has been obscured to protect the identity of\nthe victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Methods and capabilities\n\nThe attacker(s) are able to exploit several infection vectors. First, they create web pages that\ncontain “drive by” exploit code that infects the computers of those who visit the page. Second, the\nattacker(s) have also shown that they engage in spear phishing in which contextually relevant emails\nare sent to targets with PDF and DOC attachments which, when executed, create back doors that\ncause the infected computer to connect to a control server and await further instructions.\n\nWith each successful infection the attacker(s) may use any contextually relevant data to further\nexploit the targeted community and may also impersonate the initial target in order to infect all the\ntargets’ contacts. Finally, the targets themselves may infect others by forwarding infected documents\nto their contacts. In this way, the network of infected computers grows organically.\n\nThe first stage of infection focuses on getting targets to execute malicious code. Once infected, the target’s\ncomputer routinely checks in with a control server in order to receive further instructions. At this stage,\nthe attacker(s) acquires some initial information regarding the identity of the infected computer.\n\nNewer versions of the administration interface contain a direct link to a web service that looks up\nthe relevant WHOIS information about the IP address of the infected computer along with a simple\nport scan. This version also does a geoIP lookup on the infected computer’s IP address and lists the\ncountry in which the computer is located, indicating that the attacker(s) has an interest in the\ngeographical location of the infected computers.\n\nThe attack may also issue an acquire system information command that causes the infected computer to upload\nits hardware statistics, list of programs installed, list of recent documents, and current network connections.\nThe attacker(s) may use this information to target the infected computer for further exploitation.\n\nThe attacker(s) directs the infected computers to download and install a remote administration\nTrojan. The attacker(s) have demonstrated a preference for gh0st RAT but may choose from a variety\nof Trojans. The attacker(s) simply browses to the “send command” interface and pastes in a link to\na version of gh0st RAT on a “command” server under his or her control. The next time the infected\ncomputer checks in to the control server, it will be instructed to download and execute gh0st RAT.\nUpon completion, the infected computer notifies the control server and the result appears in the\nattacker(s)’ web interface.\n\nOnce gh0st RAT is installed on the target, the infected computer will periodically check a specific\nlocation and retrieve the IP address to which it is supposed to connect. When the attacker(s)\nis not available, he or she will often change this IP to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) so that the amount\nof potentially suspicious external traffic is limited. When the attacker(s) is ready to receive\nconnections, the IP address is changed to a valid external IP address.\n\nWhen the attacker(s) turns on gh0st RAT, he or she is able to see all the infected machines that have\nestablished connections to him or her. The attacker(s) may then execute a wide variety of commands,\nincluding file manager, screen capture, keylogger, remote shell, system, webcam view, audio capture,\nas well as the ability to force the infected host to download and execute additional malware, such as\na gh0st RAT update. The attacker(s) may also secretly execute programs on the target computer.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Analysis of list of infected computers\n\nA detailed analysis of the list of infected computers revealed an overwhelming number of unique\ninfections in many countries. The same malware that infected computers at the Dalai Lama’s office\nand other Tibetan organizations had a much more extensive set of targets. The list of entities and\nlocations of those targeted was quite varied.\n\nIn total, we found 1,295 infected computers located in 103 countries. We found that we were able to\nconfidently—on a scale of low, medium, high—identify 397 of the 1,295 infected computers (26.7%),\nand labelled each one as a high-value target. We did so because they were either significant to the\nrelationship between China and Tibet, Taiwan or India, or were identified as computers at foreign\nembassies, diplomatic missions, government ministries, or international organizations.\n\nOf the remaining infected computers, 536 appear to be computers on private broadband Internet\nproviders. The remaining IP addresses do not reverse resolve and available information on these\nhosts does not allow us to make judgements regarding the identity or purpose of these computers.\n\n###### Methodology\n\nWe compiled a unified and comprehensive list of infected computers from all the control servers,\nas there was considerable duplication across them. There were several duplicate entries in the list\nof infected computers—in some cases, the same infected computer was logged multiple times as it\nwas connecting from a different IP address. In other instances, multiple infected computers were\nassigned different internal IP addresses and had different computer names but shared the same\nexternal IP address. This signifies that there were multiple infected computers sharing Internet\naccess. Where possible, we filtered the results by unique computer name, and if no computer name\nwas present, we filtered by unique external IP address.[48] (See Fig. 12 - p. 41)\n\nOn the surface, the names of the infected computers in the sample are provocative. There are references\nto ministries of foreign affairs, foreign embassies, and other government entities. Some contains names of\nofficials or their positions/titles. However, we recognize that a computer name can be anything its owner\nwishes, and may be completely unrelated to the location, function, or owner of that particular computer.\n\nTherefore, in order to be more confident as to the true identity or purpose of the infected computer,\nwe relied on reverse DNS look-ups and each IP address’ record from the Regional Internet Registries.\nUsing these two pieces of information we were able to confirm the validity of the identity of several\ninfected computers with a high (H) degree of confidence.\n\nIn some cases the computer name associated with the infected computer is actually a domain\nname or an acronym for a recognizable institution or organization. In these cases we classified our\nidentification of the target with either a medium (M) or low (L) level of confidence. Medium\nconfidence refers to instances where we have otherwise identified a related high confidence target,\n\n48 In one case we removed 117 unique IP addresses from Mexico that appeared to belong to the same computer connecting in to the\ncontrol server from a DSL provider.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Fig. 12\n\n The geographic location of infected hosts.\n\nThis graphic illustrates the global reach of the GhostNet. There were 1,295 infected computers that reported to the control server. The\ninfections were spread across 103 countries. Taiwan reported the most infections followed by the United States, Vietnam and India.\n\n\n-----\n\nbut for which we rely on the computer name for identification. Low confidence refers to instances\nin which we rely solely on the computer name for identification.\n\n###### Table 2: Selected infections\n\n|Table 2: Selected infections|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Organization|Confidence|Location|Infections|\n|ASEAN|H|ID, MY|3|\n|Asian Development Bank|H|PH, IN|3|\n|Associated Press, UK|H|GB, HK|2|\n|Bureau of International Trade Relations|L|PH|1|\n|CanTV, Venezuela|H|VE|8|\n|Ceger, Portugal|H|PT|1|\n|Consulate General of Malaysia, Hong Kong|H|HK|1|\n|Deloitte & Touche, New York|H|US|1|\n|Department of Commerce, Solomon Islands|L|SB|1|\n|Department of Foreign Affairs, Indonesia|H|ID|3|\n|Department of Foreign Affairs, Philippines|H|PH|1|\n|Department of Science and Technology, Philippines|H|PH|2|\n|Embassy of China, US (see footnote 50)|H|US|1|\n|Embassy of Cyprus, Germany|H|DE|1|\n|Embassy of Germany, Australia|M|AU|1|\n|Embassy of India, Belgium|L|BE|1|\n|Embassy of India, Serbia|L|CS|1|\n|Embassy of India, Germany|H|DE|1|\n|Embassy of India, Italy|H|IT|1|\n|Embassy Of India, Kuwait|H|KW|1|\n|Embassy of India, USA|H|US|7|\n|Embassy of India, Zimbabwe|H|ZA|1|\n|Embassy of Indonesia, China|H|CN|1|\n|Embassy of Malaysia, Cuba|H|CU|1|\n|Embassy of Malaysia, Italy|H|IT|1|\n|Embassy of Malta|L|MT|4|\n|Embassy of Malta, Australia|L|AU|1|\n|Embassy of Malta, Belgium|L|BE|11|\n|Embassy of Malta, Libya|L|LY|1|\n|Embassy of Pakistan, Bahrain|L|BH|1|\n|Embassy of Papua New Guinea, China|L|CN|1|\n|Embassy of Portugal, Finland|H|FI|1|\n|Embassy of Portugal, Germany|H|DE|1|\n|Embassy of The Republic Of China (Taiwan), Swaziland|H|TW|1|\n|Embassy of Romania, Finland|H|FI|1|\n|Embassy of Romania, France|H|FR|1|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Table 2: Selected infections (cont’d)\n\n|Table 2: Selected infections (cont’d)|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Organization|Confidence|Location|Infections|\n|Embassy of Romania, Norway|H|NO|1|\n|Embassy of Romania, PRC|H|CN|1|\n|Embassy of Thailand, Philippines|H|PH|2|\n|Embassy of the Republic of Korea, China|H|CN|2|\n|Government Integrated Telecommunication Network, Malaysia|L|MY|2|\n|High Commission of India, Cyprus|H|CY|1|\n|High Commission Of India, United Kingdom|H|GB|1|\n|Institute for Information Industry, Taiwan|L|TW|1|\n|International Campaign for Tibet|H|NL|7|\n|International Chamber of Shipping, United Kingdom|L|GB|1|\n|Lanka Education and Research Network, Sri Lanka|L|LK|1|\n|Malta External Trade Corporation Ltd.|H|MT|1|\n|Maritime Police, Solomon Islands|H|SB|1|\n|Ministry of Communications, Brunei|H|BN|1|\n|Ministry of Education, Solomon Islands|H|SB|1|\n|Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bangladesh|H|BD|4|\n|Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Barbados|M|BB|5|\n|Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bhutan|L|BT|11|\n|Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Brunei|L|BN|1|\n|Ministry Of Foreign Affairs, Iran|H|IR|1|\n|Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Latvia|H|LV|2|\n|Ministry of Industry and Trade, Vietnam|L|VN|30|\n|Ministry of Labour and Human Resources, Bhutan|H|BT|1|\n|National Informatics Centre, India|L|IN|12|\n|NATO, (SHAPE HQ)|H|NL|1|\n|Net Trade, Taiwan|H|TW|1|\n|New Tang Dynasty Television, United States|L|US|1|\n|Office of the Dalai Lama, India|H|IN|2|\n|Pakistan Mission to The United Nations|L|US, JP|4|\n|Permanent Delegation of Cyprus to the European Union|L|BE|1|\n|Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations|L|US|1|\n|PetroVietnam|L|VN|74|\n|Prime Minister’s Office, Laos|H|LA|5|\n|Public Service Division, Solomon Islands|H|SB|1|\n|Russian Federal University Network, Russian Federation|H|RU|1|\n|Software Technology Parks of India, India|L|IN|2|\n|South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|L|BD, US|5|\n|Students for a Free Tibet, United States|H|US|2|\n|TAITRA, Taiwan|H|TW, NG|79|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Table 2: Selected infections (cont’d)\n\nOrganization Confidence Location Infections\n\nTaiwan Government Service Network, Taiwan H TW 1\n\nTibetan Government in Exile, India H IN, US 4\n\nTrade and Industry Department, Government of Hong Kong H HK 1\n\n###### Infection timeline\n\nThe earliest infected computer called home to the control server on May 22, 2007. The most recent\nentry in our sample is March 12, 2009. On average, the amount of time that a host was actively\ninfected was 145 days.[49] While 90 infected computers were only infected for one day, 145 were\ninfected for over 400 days. The longest infection span was 660 days. In total, 422 hosts checked in\nMarch 1-12, 2009; 373 of these computers were infected in 2008. The data indicates that despite a\nreduction in new infections, the network continues to be operational. (See Fig. 13 - p. 45)\n\nThere are significant spikes in infection rates in December 2007 and August 2008.\n\nThere were 320 infections in December 2007 spread across 56 countries. However, 113 were located\nwithin Taiwan and the majority of these infections occurred within a single organization: the\nTaiwan External Trade Development Council. During this same period, computers at the Embassies\nof India in Belgium and Zimbabwe were infected as were the Embassies of Indonesia and the\nRepublic of Korea in the People’s Republic of China. In addition, computers at the Ministry of\nForeign Affairs in Iran were infected as were several computers at the Tibetan Government-in-Exile.\n\nThe spike in August 2008 totalled 258 infections spread across 46 countries. The OHHDL computer\nwas infected during one of these spikes in August 2008 (It last checked in to the control server\nin September 2008). This spike included the Chinese Embassy in the United States,[50] 3 computers\nat the Embassy of India in the Unites States, and the High Commission of India in the United\nKingdom and in Cyprus. It also included the Embassy of Cyprus in Germany, the Embassy of\nMalaysia in Cuba, the Embassy of Thailand in the Philippines and the Ministry of Industry in\nVietnam. Several companies were also compromised, including Net Trade in Taiwan, the New York\nOffice of Deloitte & Touche, and PetroVietnam, the government-owned oil and gas Company.\n\n49 The average number of days from the initial infection to the last time an infected computer “checked in” with a control server.\n\n50 It is unclear whether the affected embassy is the Republic of China (Taiwan) or People’s Republic of China.\n\n|Table 2: Selected infections (cont’d)|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Organization|Confidence|Location|Infections|\n|Taiwan Government Service Network, Taiwan|H|TW|1|\n|Tibetan Government in Exile, India|H|IN, US|4|\n|Trade and Industry Department, Government of Hong Kong|H|HK|1|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Fig. 13\n\n GhostNet infection timeline.\n\nThis screen capture of a timeline generated with Palantir illustrates when and how many computers were infected by the GhostNet.\nIt shows that there are significant spikes in infection rates in December 2007 and August 2008.\n\n\n-----\n\n## PART THREE: \n### Investigating GhostNet: Conclusions\n\n\n-----\n\n**The evidence presented in this report—through a combination of field investigations,**\n**interviews, technical scouting, data analysis, mining and visualization—paints a**\n**disturbing picture.**\n\n_GhostNet represents a network of compromised computers resident in high-value political,_\neconomic, and media locations spread across numerous countries worldwide. At the time of writing,\nthese organizations are almost certainly oblivious to the compromised situation in which they find\nthemselves. The computers of diplomats, military attachés, private assistants, secretaries to Prime\nMinisters, journalists and others are under the concealed control of unknown assailant(s).\n\nIn Dharamsala and elsewhere, we have witnessed machines being profiled and sensitive documents\nbeing removed. At our Laboratory, we have analysed our own infected “honey pot” computer\nand discovered that the capabilities of GhostNet are potent and wide ranging. Almost certainly,\ndocuments are being removed without the targets’ knowledge, keystrokes logged, web cameras are\nbeing silently triggered, and audio inputs surreptitiously activated.\n\nThis raises the question, how many sensitive activities have been preemptively anticipated by\nintelligence gathered through this network? How many illegal transactions have been facilitated by\ninformation harvested through GhostNet? Worst of all, how many people may have been put at risk?\n\nWhile these questions are compelling, it would be imprudent to read these findings as an indictment,\nor to attribute to the owners of GhostNet motivations and intentions for which there is no evidence.\n\n###### Alternative explanations\n\nThe list of computers controlled by the GhostNet is significant, and certainly atypical for a cybercrime\nnetwork. The size of the network is small, and the concentration of high-value systems is significant.\n\nAt the same time, penetrations of this type are not uncommon. Recently, several large-scale spy\nnets have been discovered, including ones containing lists of affected computers of a magnitude\nhigher than that harvested by GhostNet.\n\nThis trend is predictable, converging with accumulating incidents of cyber-attacks facilitated by\nlower entry-thresholds for computer exploitation methods and technologies. The tools we profile in\nour investigation, though apparently amassed in a complex way to achieve a definite purpose, are\nnot restricted to an exclusive guild of experts with specialized and confidential knowledge.\n\nToday, pirated cyber-crime kits circulate extensively on the Internet and can be downloaded by\nanyone about as easily as the latest pirated DVD.[51] Cyberspace has empowered individuals and small\ngroups of non-state actors to do many things, including executing sophisticated computer network\noperations that were previously only the domain of state intelligence agencies. We have entered\nthe era of do-it-yourself (DIY) signals intelligence.\n\n51 http://ddanchev.blogspot.com/2008/11/zeus-crimeware-kit-gets-carding-layout.html\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Attribution\n\nWho is ultimately in control of the GhostNet system? While our analysis reveals that numerous\npolitically sensitive and high-value computer systems were compromised, we do not know the\nmotivation or the identity of the attacker(s) or how to accurately characterize this network of\ninfections as a whole. We have not been able to ascertain the type of data that has been obtained\nby the attacker(s), apart from the basic system information and file listings of the documents\nlocated on the target computers. Without this data we are unable to deduce with any certainty\nwhat kind of data the attacker(s) were after. There are thus several possibilities for attribution.\n\nThe most obvious explanation, and certainly the one in which the circumstantial evidence tilts the\nstrongest, would be that this set of high profile targets has been exploited by the Chinese state for\nmilitary and strategic-intelligence purposes. Indeed, as described above, many of the high confidence,\nhigh-value targets that we identified are clearly linked to Chinese foreign and defence policy,\nparticularly in South and South East Asia. Like radar sweeping around the southern border of China,\nthere is an arc of infected nodes from India, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Vietnam, through Laos, Brunei,\nPhilippines, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Many of the high profile targets reflect some of China’s most\nvexing foreign and security policy issues, including Tibet and Taiwan. Moreover, the attacker(s)’ IP\naddresses examined here trace back in at least several instances to Hainan Island, home of the Lingshui\nsignals intelligence facility and the Third Technical Department of the People’s Liberation Army.[52]\n\nHowever, we must be cautious to rush to judgement in spite of circumstantial and other evidence,\nas alternative explanations are certainly possible and charges against a government of this nature\nare gravely serious. On the other end of the spectrum is the explanation that this is a random set\nof infected computers that just happens to include high profile targets of strategic significance\nto China, collected by an individual or group with no political agenda per se. Similarly one can\npostulate that the targets gathered together happened less by concerted effort than by sheer\ncoincidence. Given the groupings of various entities in the infected computer list (by country\nand organization), internal email communications and sloppy security practices could have led to\ncross-infection and subsequent listing on the control servers.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that there is a single individual or set of individuals (criminal networks,\nfor example) who are targeting these high-value targets for profit. This can be in the form of stealing\nfinancial information or critical data that can be sold to clients, be they states or private entities. There\nare countless examples of large-scale fraud and data theft worldwide and numerous apparent instances\nof outsourcing to third parties of cyber-attacks and espionage, some of which the Information Warfare\nMonitor and its related research project, the OpenNet Initiative, have documented. GhostNet could very\nwell be a for-profit, non-state venture. Even “patriotic hackers” could be acting on their own volition,\nor with the tacit approval of their government, as operators of the GhostNet.\n\nFinally, it is not inconceivable that this network of infected computers could have been targeted\nby a state other than China, but operated physically within China (and at least one node in\n\n52 http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/lingshui.htm\n\n\n-----\n\nthe United States) for strategic purposes. Compromised proxy computers on Hainan Island, for\nexample, could have been deployed as staging posts, perhaps in an effort to deliberately mislead\nobservers as to the true operator(s) and purpose of the GhostNet system.\n\n###### The Significance of GhostNet\n\n_GhostNet is significant, as it does not appear to be a typical cybercrime network. The potential_\npolitical fallout is enormous. But ultimately, the question of who is behind the GhostNet may\nmatter less than the strategic significance of the collection of affected targets. What this study\ndiscovered is serious evidence that information security is an item requiring urgent attention at\nthe highest levels. It demonstrates that the subterranean layers of cyberspace, about which most\nusers are unaware, are domains of active reconnaissance, surveillance, and exploitation.\n\nRegardless of who or what is ultimately in control of GhostNet, its capabilities of exploitation and\nthe strategic intelligence that can be harvested from it matter most. Indeed, although the Achilles’\nheel of the GhostNet system allowed us to monitor and document its far-reaching network of\ninfiltration, we can safely hypothesize that it is neither the first nor the only one of its kind.\n\n\n-----\n\n## PART FOUR: \n### About Information Warfare Monitor\n\n\n-----\n\n### About the Information Warfare Monitor\n\n**http://infowar-monitor.net/**\n\nThe Information Warfare Monitor is an advanced research activity tracking the emergence of cyberspace\nas a strategic domain. We are an independent research effort. Our mission is to build and broaden the\nevidence base available to scholars, policymakers, and others. We aim to educate and inform.\n\nThe Information Warfare Monitor is a public-private venture between two Canadian institutions: The\nSecDev Group, an operational think tank based in Ottawa (Canada), and the Citizen Lab at the Munk\nCentre for International Studies, University of Toronto. The Principal Investigators and\nco-founders of the Information Warfare Monitor are Rafal Rohozinski (The SecDev Group) and\nRonald Deibert (Citizen Lab).\n\nThe Information Warfare Monitor is supported by The SecDev Group which conducts field-based\ninvestigations and data gathering. Our advanced research and analysis facilities are located at the\nCitizen Lab. IWM is part of the Citizen Lab’s network of advanced research projects, which include the\nOpenNet Initiative and ONI Asia.\n\nThe Information Warfare Monitor also benefits from donations from a variety of sponsors including\nPsiphon Inc, and Palantir Technologies.\n\nThe Information Warfare Monitor engages in three primary activities:\n\n**1. Case Studies. We design and carry out active case study research. These are self-generated**\nactivities consistent with our mission.\n\nWe employ a rigorous and multidisciplinary approach to all our case studies blending qualitative, technical,\nand quantitative methods. As a general rule, our investigations consist of at least two components:\n\n_Field-based investigations. We engage in qualitative research among affected_\ntarget audiences and employ techniques that include interviews, long-term in situ\ninteraction with our partners, and extensive technical data collection involving\nsystem monitoring, network reconnaissance, and interrogation. Our field-based teams\nare supported by senior analysts and regional specialists, including social scientists,\ncomputer security professionals, policy experts, and linguists, who provide additional\ncontextual support and substantive back-up.\n\n_Technical scouting and laboratory analysis. Data collected in the field is rigorously_\nanalysed using a variety of advanced data fusion and visualization methods. Leads\ndeveloped on the basis of infield activities are pursued through “technical scouting,”\nincluding computer network investigations, and the resulting data and analysis\nis shared with our infield teams and partners for verification and for generating\nadditional entry points for follow-on investigations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**2. Open Source Trend Analysis. We collect open-source information from the press and other**\nsources tracking global trends in cyberspace. These are published on our public website.\n\n**3. Analytical Workshops and Outreach. We work closely with academia, human rights**\norganizations, and the defense and intelligence community. We publish reports, and occasionally\nconduct joint workshops. Our work is independent, and not subject to government classification. Our\ngoal is to encourage vigorous debate around critical policy issues. This includes engaging in ethical\nand legal considerations of information operations, computer network attacks, and computer network\nexploitation, including the targeted use of Trojans and malware, denial of service attacks, and\ncontent filtering.\n\n###### About The SecDev Group\n\n**http://www.secdev.ca**\n\nThe SecDev Group is a Canadian-based operational consultancy focused on countries and regions at\nrisk from violence and insecurity. We deliver to our clients insights and access to a diverse range\nof cultures, audiences, challenging environments and ungoverned spaces. Our approach combines\na field research capability with advanced techniques and methods for generating policy-relevant\nanalysis and solutions. As a think tank, we identify and communicate realistic options to enhance\neffectiveness through evidence-based research on the causes, consequences and trajectories of\ninsecurity and violence. We are operational because we design and conduct activities in complex and\ninsecure environments.\n\n###### About The Citizen Lab\n\n**http://www.citzenlab.org**\n\nThe Citizen Lab is an interdisciplinary laboratory based at the Munk Centre for International Studies at\nthe University of Toronto, Canada focusing on advanced research and development at the intersection\nof digital media and world politics. We are a hothouse that combines the disciplines of political\nscience, sociology, computer science, engineering, and graphic design. Our mission is to undertake\nadvanced research and engage in development that monitors, analyses, and impacts the exercise of\npolitical power in cyberspace. The Citizen Lab’s ongoing research network includes the Information\nWarfare Monitor and the OpenNet Initiative, ONI Asia, and benefits from collaborative partnerships\nwith academic institutions, NGOs, and other partners in all regions of the world.\n\n\n-----",
