This activity leveraged exploit code for a**\n\n**zero-day vulnerability now identified as CVE-2014-0322 and ultimately infected victims with�**\n\n**ZxShell malware. CrowdStrike Intelligence attributed this attack to the AURORA PANDA**\n\n**adversary; however, the discovery of additional indicators revealed that another adversary was**\n\n**leveraging the same vulnerability to carry out targeted attacks nearly a month before the VFW**\n\n**attack occurred. This other activity appears to be focused on French aerospace and shares**\n\n**similarities with a 2012 SWC campaign affecting the website of U.S.-based turbine manufacturer,**\n\n**Capstone Turbine.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**iframe located at savmpet[.]com. The iframe redirected visitors to gifas[.]assso[.]net, which was**\n\n**hosting exploit code in two files (include.html and Tope.swf) as well as a malicious payload�**\n\n**(Erido.jpg).**\n\n**Above are screenshots of the savmpet[.]com webpage and part of the page source showing the**\n\n**date that it was last modified and the iframe redirect. The content of the page was taken from the�**\n\n**website of the French aerospace industries association, Groupement des industries françaises**\n\n**aéronautiques et spatiales (GIFAS). The 17 January 2014 date on both the webpage and the**\n\n**page source shows that it was created nearly a month before the VFW attack occurred**\n\n**Victim exploitation occurred in the same manner as in the VFW activity, but the payload was**\n\n**different. Instead of ZxShell malware connecting to AURORA PANDA-related infrastructure, it was**\n\n**a malware variant known as Sakula connecting to command-and-control (C2) infrastructure at**\n\n**oa[.]ameteksen[.]com.**\n\n**French Aerospace Focus**\n\n**This attack’s most obvious connection to French aerospace is the content taken from the GIFAS**\n\n**website and the GIFAS-based domain used to host the exploit code and payload**\n\n**(gifas[.]assso[.]net). However, a more in-depth look reveals additional connections.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**gifas[.]assso[.]net. Several other domains were also pointed at this IP during the same time**\n\n**frame, including two that contained the same content and malicious iframe as savmpet[.]com,**\n\n**secure[.]safran-group[.]com, and icbcqsz[.]com.**\n\n**Of particular interest was secure[.]safran-group[.]com. Safran is a France-based aerospace and**\n\n**defense company with a focus on the design and production of aircraft engines and equipment.**\n\n**The company owns the safran-group[.]com domain, and the fact that one of its subdomains was**\n\n**pointed at a malicious IP address suggests that the adversary compromised Safran’s DNS.**\n\n**The Sakula malware used in this attack contained an unusual and interesting component that**\n\n**further indicates a focus on French aerospace. As part of the infection process, it added a**\n\n**number of domains to the “host’s” file of victim machines.�**\n\n**The snecma[.]fr domain belongs to the Safran subsidiary, Snecma, that designs and builds**\n\n**engines for civilian and military aircraft, and spacecraft. The domains listed appear to provide**\n\n**remote access to the company’s employees and possibly third-party contractors.**\n\n**The purpose of this component is unclear. It does not map these domains to malicious IP**\n\n**addresses because the 217.108.170.0/24 range belongs to the company, which means it is not**\n\n**meant to send victims directly to adversary infrastructure for credential collection. One possibility**\n\n**is that it was meant to make the malware appear more legitimate. It has also been**\n\n**hypothesized that this was done to ensure DNS connectivity to these particular domains;**\n\n**however, it seems unlikely that victims would suffer significant DNS connectivity issues, which�**\n\n**means that adding this component to the malware for that purpose would be somewhat**\n\n**superfluous.�**\n\n**It should be noted that no victim logs related to this attack were discovered, so it is unclear who**\n\n**the actual targets and victims were. Having the secure[.]safran-group[.]com domain pointed at a**\n\n**malicious IP indicates that Safran suffered a DNS compromise, but no deeper network**\n\n**compromise was observed. It is possible that the adversary desired to target the French**\n\n\n-----\n\n**In January 2013, it was reported that the website for U.S.-based turbine manufacturer, Capstone**\n\n**Turbine, had been compromised and was being used in a SWC attack leveraging an exploit for**\n\n**the CVE-2012-4792. There are three primary similarities between the Capstone Turbine attack**\n\n**and the recent French aerospace activity.**\n\n**The first, and most significant, connection is the use of Sakula malware. In both campaigns,�**\n\n**Sakula variants were installed on successfully exploited machines. In Capstone Turbine, the**\n\n**Sakula sample used (MD5 hash: 61fe6f4cb2c54511f0804b1417ab3bd2) connected to**\n\n**web[.]vipreclod[.]com, and in the recent attack, the sample (MD5 hash:**\n\n**c869c75ed1998294af3c676bdbd56851) connected to oa[.]ameteksen[.]com. Use of this malware**\n\n**doesn’t appear to be widespread, but it is not yet clear whether only one group uses it, and**\n\n**therefore its use alone does not necessarily indicate a particular adversary.**\n\n**Another similarity is that GIFAS-based malicious domains are related to each incident. In the**\n\n**more recent attack, the gifas[.]assso[.]net domain was used to host exploit code and the**\n\n**malicious payload. The Capstone Turbine incident did not directly use a GIFAS-based domain,**\n\n**but a deeper look at network indicators related to those observed in the Capstone incident reveals**\n\n**two such domains: gifas[.]cechire[.]com and gifas[.]blogsite[.]org.**\n\n**The third similarity between the two is the use of zero-days. The exploit used in Capstone**\n\n**Turbine was a zero-day during the time it was active, just like the exploit used in the recent**\n\n**French aerospace activity. This is a general similarity that does not create a definitive link�**\n\n**between the two attacks, but when viewed in conjunction with the use of the same malware and**\n\n**GIFAS-based domains, it strengthens the connection.**\n\n\n-----\n\n## ← Mo’ Shells Mo’ Problems – File List Details about Apple SSL vulnerability and Stacking iOS 7.0.6 patch →\n\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n The Imperative for Proactive Incident Response in 2015 and Beyond\n\n**November 3, 2015**\n\n## Why Your Business Environment Should Drive Cybersecurity\n\n**November 2, 2015**\n\n## Blurring of Commodity and Targeted Attack Malware\n\n**October 16, 2015**\n\n## Should I Really Trust the Cloud with my Endpoint Protection?\n\n\n## Follow Us\n\n**Tweets about \"from:crowdstrike OR from:Adam_Cyber OR from:JMDeC OR from:DmitriCyber OR**\n\n**from:StevenChabinsky OR from:George_Kurtz\"**\n\n\n-----\n\n|M|T|W|T|F|S|S|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||||||1|\n|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|\n|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|\n|16|17|18|19|20|21|22|\n|23|24|25|26|27|28|29|\n|30|||||||\n\n\n## Archives\n\n### N O V E M B E R 2 0 1 5\n\n**M** **T** **W** **T** **F** **S** **S**\n\n**1**\n\n**[2](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/2015/11/02/)** **[3](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/2015/11/03/)** **4** **5** **6** **7** **8**\n\n**9** **10** **11** **12** **[13](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/2015/11/13/)** **14** **15**\n\n**16** **17** **[18](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/2015/11/18/)** **19** **20** **21** **22**\n\n**23** **24** **25** **26** **27** **28** **29**\n\n**30**\n\n**[« Oct](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/2015/10/)**\n\n\n## Recent Comments\n\n\n-----",
