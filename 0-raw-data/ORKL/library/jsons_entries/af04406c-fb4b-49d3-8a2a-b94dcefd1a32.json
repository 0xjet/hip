Blog](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs)\n\nJuly 2, 2012 | [Jaime Blasco](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/author/jaime-blasco)\nIt has been a while since we published information about Sykipot. The last time we blogged\nabout it, we discovered a variant that was able to bypass two-factor authentication to access\nprotected resources on the victim’s network.\n\nWe have detected a new wave of Sykipot campaigns that has been running during the past\nweeks. There are several changes between the new Sykipot campaigns and the older ones.\n\nThe first difference is that in previous campaigns the Sykipot authors mainly used file-format\nexploits to gain access to the systems through spearphishing mails. This is the list of fileformat exploits used in the past:\n\n**CVE** **Date** **Product**\n\nCVE-2007-0671 2007-02-02 Microsoft Excel\n\nCVE-2009-3957 2010-12-01 Adobe Reader\n\nCVE-2010-0806 2010-05-04 Internet Explorer\n\nCVE-2010-2883 2010-09-08 Adobe Reader\n\nCVE-2010-3654 2010-10-28 Adobe Flash Player\n\nCVE-2011-2462 2011-12-06 Adobe Reader\n\nThis time it seems they are mainly using drive-by-download exploits like CVE-2011-0611\n[affecting Flash Player or the new Windows XML Core zero-day vulnerability.](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2719615)\n\nThe CVE-2012-1889 vulnerability is related to Google’s warnings on state-sponsored\nattacks.\n\nInstead of attaching malicious files on e-mails, they send e-mails to the victims with a\nmalicious link. Once the victim clicks on the link the malicious server tries to exploit a\nvulnerability on the user’s browser.\n\nThe modus operandi of the group behind these attacks seems to be the same as in the past.\nThe attackers hack US based servers and then install software to serve the malicious\ncontent or to redirect the connections to a remote server\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware continues using SSL to communicate with the C&C server. Once executed, the\nmalware tries to get a configuration file from a remote server. On the older versions they\nused an underlying encryption using the XOR key “19990817” for the config files. The XOR\nobfuscation has been removed and in the new versions a simple byte subtraction routine is\nused.\n\nThe configuration file is requested from a\nremote server using the following URL format:\n\nGET /get.asp?nm=index.dat&hnm=\n\n[HOSTNAME]-[IP-ADDRESS]-[IDENTIFIER]\n(SSL based)\n\nThey continue to use the hardcoded referer of\n‘www.yahoo.com’ on the requests.\n\nThe new configuration format supports several\ncommands and most of the previous names\nhave changed. This is the list of supported\ninstructions:\n\n                         - porth - List of active connections (netstat-like)\n\n- processh - List of processes running on the system\n\n- tasklisth - List of processess (tasklist.exe-like)\n\n- serviceslisth - List of running services and their status (running/stopped)\n\n- starth - Starts a service\n\n- stoph - Stops a service\n\n- delh - Deletes a file\n\n- gh - Gets a file from the C&C server\n\n- ph - Uploads a file to the C&C server\n\n- dir/h - Lists a directory/file\n\n- dir/sh - Lists a directory/file\n\n- runh \n- EXITH - Deletes the malware from the system\n\n\n-----\n\n- info - Executes a command (Winexec)\n\n- without param - Gets network info and startup time\n\n- sleeph - Sleeps a number of seconds\n\nOnce the malware downloads the config file it executes every instructions, it saves the result\nand obfuscates the data using the subtraction routine. Finally it sends the result to the C&C\nserver.\n\nSome of the known Sykipot domains that are being used to serve malicious content or as\nC&C domains are:\n\n- newcarstyle.com\n\n- nhrasurvey.org\n\n- quicksurveypro.com\n\n- contractspt.com\n\n- betterslife.com\n\n- aeroconf13.org\n\n- e-landusa.net\n\n- photosmagnum.com\n\n- reythy.com\n\nMost of the domains have been registered during the last month and they have used the mail\naddress jimgreen200088 [at] yahoo.com to register most of them.\n\nThe Netbox webserver used in previous campaigns is also present in most of the C&C\nservers .\n\nNote the domain aeroconf13.org seems to be related with a spearphishing campaign against\npotential attendees of the IEEE Aerospace Conference (the International Conference for\nAerospace Experts, Academics, Military Personnel, and Industry Leaders).\n\nWe will continue to offer more information on these new campaigns as long as we find more\ndetails. Stay tune for more information and apply your patches!\n\n## Share this with others\n\nTags: [sykipot,](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/tag/sykipot) [ieee aerospace conference,](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/tag/ieee+aerospace+conference) [cve-2012-1889](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/tag/cve-2012-1889)\n\n\n-----",
